      <field name="fulltext">—With equal Pace, impartial Fate Knocks at the Palace, as the Cottage Gate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. Time and Death: AN INTRODUCTORY DIALOGUE. Death. “Father Time! 'tis well we are met:— I am dispos'd to fume and fret, To see that mortals have the power Thus to prolong Life's fleeting hour; To see them thus display the art That blunts my unavailing dart; And, though the fatal arrow's sped, To make men live when they are dead: While you with placid eye look on, Nor blame the mischief that is done: Nay, suffer the records to last When many an age is gone and past. You, in your motions, are so slow, With such a measur'd step you go, That were it not for sword and fire, Earthquakes, and storms and tempests dire, Temples and towers of ancient days Would now their perfect structures raise Nay, still the Antiquarian's toil Digs deep for Greek and Roman spoil. In Desolation's arid fields The perforated cavern yields The vase, the statue, and the bust, Rais'd from th'accumulated dust. Thus, 'neath the modern dome appears The treasures of far distant years, Which, by their various forms impart A blended grace to modern art. So idly you your power employ, That art restores what you destroy. —'Tis true, you thin the flowing hair, And pluck the brow 'till it is bare: You, by degrees, can mark the face With your own venerable grace, And tell the weaken'd form to bend As it draws near its journey's end. —But if nor pain, nor sickness aid, Nor rending care the heart invade, Your progress is so slowly made, That all too late Man's made to feel The stroke of my impatient steel: So that I'm courted to attend The old man's death-bed as a friend; When, my stern purpose to revile, Departing Nature beams a smile. —I love dispatch, I strike at once The wit, the wise, the fool, the dunce: The steel-clad soldier, stout and bold, The miser, with his treasur'd gold; The studious sage, and matron grave, The haughty noble, and the slave. I strip, with unrelenting paw, The ermine from the man of law; Disrobe the prelate of his lawn, And dim with clouds the op'ning dawn Of Beauty's charms: I drink the tear That drops upon the early bier:— Nor spare I Tenderness or Truth, The hoary head, th'ingenuous youth; And Vice and Virtue ever prove An equal doom with Hate or Love. I seize the victor in his car, Encircled with the spoils of war: Unmov'd by power, unaw'd by state, I strike the monarch's guarded gate, And in that very hour invade The cot beneath the elm-tree's shade. I by one fatal word, can dry The streaming tears of Misery, Or stop their loud, promiscuous laugh, Who the rich midnight goblet quaff. But all this power contents me not, When the man dies, his name should rot; Nor with surviving fame defy The arm by which all mortals die. To Egypt's beauteous Queen I bore The worm with fig-leaves cover'd o'er, Whose venom'd weapon did impart Its fatal moisture to her heart. But still she lives in prose and song, Her bark still glides the waves among: Still are its purple sails unfurl'd To woo the man who shar'd the world. —When my hand seiz'd young Ammon's sword, And from the earth bore off its Lord, I could not stifle his renown,— I could not blast the laurel crown Wove by the cunning hands of Fame, To consecrate the victor's name.— Such when his glorious life is done, Will be the meed of Wellington: He will my envious power defy, And leave a name that ne'er shall die. It is, Old Time, so long ago Since my spear laid those monarchs low, To dignify whose cold remains The pyramids oppress'd the plains, That no memorial is supplied, Of who they were, and when they died: But still these structures mock the sky, And your submissive power defy. Thus Art contrives, we feel it true, To laugh at me—and baffle you. —These carving, painting, writing fellows, I own it, make me very jealous. Behold this host of antique elves Who range along the crowded shelves,— They represent the king, the sage, The great and good of ev'ry age; The wise and weak of ev'ry time,— And villains nurs'd in ev'ry clime: See with what pride these artists shew 'em,— Let loose your scythe, old Boy, and mow 'em Be, for once, active in your trust,— Breathe,—and corrode them into dust. I've no dominion o'er the page That makes men live from age to age; Nor can destroy his marble form Who long since fed the hungry worm. Could I,—no name should ever bloom, Or on the page, or on the tomb. I say, 'tis hard, and still complain, That man should die and live again. That Art should from Oblivion save The mould'ring tenants of the grave: That it preserves, in form and feature, Whate'er has been a living creature. A goldfinch dies,—but what of that? Though I inspir'd the savage cat To do the deed.—Though Betty's huff'd For want of care,—the bird is stuff'd, And on its perch it seems to thrive; Nay, looks as well as when alive. 'Tis true, I may have spoil'd its note, But still the thing preserves its coat. —Again, I say, as you must see, That Art and Learning both agree, To laugh at you, and baffle me.” Time. “What, Grisly Shape, do you complain, And curse the limits of your reign? You, who can wage continual strife With all things that partake of life, Lamenting, though your spear is hurl'd Each moment, through a suffering world? You are allow'd the fatal art To break a neck or break a heart, To let out life as it may suit Your savage will—you murd'rous brute.— What would you more?—you hourly meet The funeral trains in ev'ry street; And stately mausoleums rise As altars for your sacrifice. More do you want?—then take a dance Among the blood-stain'd fields of France: Ask Revolution how she sped With her innumerable dead. Is not your grasping arm content With the whole bleeding Continent?— Could YOU your frantic wish enjoy, The world itself you would destroy: Creation's bounds you would bestride, And be yourself a Suicide. More calmly then, pursue your trade, Take up the mattock and the spade; Heap dust on dust, add grave to grave, Forget to fume, and fret, and rave; And tune the burthen of the song— ‘That life is short—but Art is long.’ While you grin o'er the page before you, You know you cannot touch the story; Nor can you shove into a hearse The Heav'n-born Bard's inspired verse: You may, from mere resentment, kill Th'unconscious Painter, if you will; Yet, with his Work, his Name shall live, And share the praise that Time can give. The sculptur'd forms that stand around, By my preserving spells are bound. So 'tis arrang'd by that decree Whose law commands both YOU and ME: Cease then, I pray you, to complain, Your Lamentations all are vain. —You've told me in what feats you shine, And now you will attend to mine. 'Tis I who to the human race Give the immeasurable space, Which from the æra of my birth, Form'd the vast scene of man on earth; And will, in order due, extend, Till the vast scene of man shall end. My course is regular and quiet, I make no noise, I breed no riot. Indeed, where'er my scythe appears, It mows down days, and months, and years, But 'tis a tranquil, silent deed; And other days and years succeed. I sometimes wear a wintry robe, And, in dark mantle, clad the globe: But, do I ever fail to bring The fragrant zephyrs of the Spring? The bounteous Summer next succeeds, And the Autumnal vintage bleeds. Thus through the year I bless the eye With infinite variety. My office, sometimes, may annoy, But I ne'er hurry to destroy: I on my well-pois'd wings attend, And wait for Nature's ling'ring end. May not I boast that I give birth To all that decorates the earth; And, with renewing charm, supply The waste of all beneath the sky? Old age, the common eye will scan In meaner things as well as man: But, when the antique turrets fall, When the storm shakes the mould'ring wall, I leave the venerated place For modern art and skill to grace; And make the wond'ring plain admire The stranger forms and new attire. 'Tis true, destruction I employ,— But I preserve e'er I destroy. When you, and your twin-brother Care, A life prolong'd to mortals spare, You say, I wrinkle o'er the cheek, And make the pate so smooth and sleek: But that is Wisdom's garb, and wore By Nestor sage in days of yore: Nay, as your ghastly eyes may see, 'Tis worn, you scraggy Shape, by me. If Sickness hastens the decline Of fading life, if pains combine, They are your ministers—not mine. I lead by slow and mild decay: 'Tis you that interrupt the way. You force the youth in vernal bloom, To seek the Winter of the tomb. Life left to me, through ev'ry stage, Would pass from infancy to age: Its flame—the Climacteric past, Would in the Socket sink at last; But know, our final hour will come, And WE shall share a common doom: When, in the world's last hurricane, My pennons broad I flap in vain; And you shall ghastly grin and shiver, With not an arrow in your quiver; Then mortals, mortal then no more, Shall to empyreal regions soar: Then TIME shall end—and DEATH shall die, And MAN quaff Immortality.” The Antiquary's Last Will &amp; Testament. —“WELL, I am going, (Fungus said,) As Lawyer Sly approach'd the bed: I'm drawing to the close of life, And, as I've neither child nor wife, I am just turning o'er my will, And wish to add a codicil; For I have sundry treasures rare, Which are not yet recorded there; And, as I soon shall cease to breathe, I wish some relics to bequeath, To those who will their value own When life is past, and I am gone: So take your pen, prepare to write; And, as I dictate—you indite.— To my old friend Sir Edmund Plumb, I leave the Eighth King Harry's Thumb: 'Tis well preserv'd;—in gold 'tis set, At top and bottom tipp'd with Jet; And I can prove, by word and date, And other documents of weight, That Cromwell, for he oft abus'd it, As a Tobacco-stopper us'd it. —And, as my friend shall thus employ This little, antique curious Toy; As he its form must daily see, He'll think it says—‘Remember me.’ —To Horace Dactyl, next I give, As soon as I shall cease to live, The Lock of Hair which caus'd the strife That Pope has painted to the Life. Sailing aloft in Fancy's car, His Muse has chang'd it to a star;— But I know better—don't reveal it:— I brib'd the Lady's Maid—to steal it: And in that Cabinet it lies, A precious gem to Poets' eyes. But though, as Antiquarian Fare, It will not any value bear; For not a century has sped, Since it adorn'd a lady's head: Yet to the Muse 'tis ever dear, This Lock the Bard will long revere; And thus it is that I bestow it:— 'Cause Horace Dactyl, is a Poet. I give the Cushion, finely scroll'd, With faded flowers and tarnish'd gold, Whose rich embroidery was plann'd And work'd by Anna Boleyn's hand; From which her prayers did Heav'n invoke, Before the Headsman gave the stroke,— To my good maiden cousin Kate, Who loves to be devout in state; So that, hereafter, she'll be seen To say her prayers like any Queen. The Shuttle-cock, which oft amus'd The Scottish Mary, when accus'd Of treas'nous plots, of many a wile, And did the heavy hours beguile, As within Fotheringay's towers She pass'd the sad and ling'ring hours, I to my Nephew Playful leave, The Battledore I also give; For well I know there is but one: Indeed, 'twere best, as could, be shewn, That he should play the Fool, alone. There's Turpin's bones well put together, Which many a year withstood the weather, As on a Gibbet's height they hung, And, when the wind blew briskly, swung. 'Tis now a century ago Since this same Knight work'd mickle woe, On certain folks that go abroad, And travel on a public road. These he had got a way to frighten, And of their cash and watches lighten; But having ventur'd on the Mail, His fortune then began to fail. Tyburn, at length, his triumphs ended On Hounslow Heath to be suspended. In time the iron chains gave way, And to preserve him from decay, I had the unsettled bones new set, And plac'd them in my Cabinet. This curious Skeleton I leave, If he will my bequest receive, To my Friend All-sop, who, as Mayor, Will one day fill the City Chair: And such a paunch he doth unfold, As largest barrow could not hold. This Legacy I do commend, In the true spirit of a Friend; That it may this good lesson tell, To one I've known so long—so well.— ‘Though you for years, that Carease line, ‘Though ev'ry day on dainties dine: ‘And crack your jokes, and drink your wine. ‘Though you're so fat—you'll one day see ‘Yourself, good Sir, as thin as me; ‘And, all your joyous banquets past, ‘A shape, like mine, you'll have at last.’ —A Bull's Horn full six feet in measure, A unique thing—a perfect treasure, Nam'd, by Antiquarians sage, The growth of a far distant age; Nay, 'tis by many understood, To've been a Horn before the flood. —I give it—but I can't proceed, Howe'er important be the deed, I'm so fatigu'd and full of pain:— To-morrow, Lawyer, call again. —In reading, some relief I'll seek, For 'tis a trouble now to speak. —Holla! holla there!—much I fear My voice will never make them hear: Nor have I strength to pull the bell, To call up Jonathan, to tell That Lawyer Sly has been so nimble, As to slip on Queen Mary's thimble: And he has manag'd to purloin A velvet purse and all its coin; So wrought, and of such ancient date, That they are ten times worth their weight. Most surely, at to-morrow's meeting, A Constable shall give him greeting. Indeed, I wish that I were hurl'd, At once, out of this pilf'ring world. I can't stay long, and if t'were now— —When Death appear'd, and made his Bow. Old Fungus lifted up his eye, And saw the Grisly Spectre nigh. I'm not alarm'd, (he calmly said,) I do not your approach upbraid: But look not quite so fierce, and pray. At least, for one half-hour stay. —A thing or two, I wish to know, So tell me now, before I go:— You liv'd in fam'd Deucalion's time, When this old world was in its prime. Say, in those days did men grow bolder, And o'er top us by head and shoulder? Or did those antiquated people Grow up as tall as modern steeple? Besides, my Will does not make out, It is a matter still of doubt, Whether I'll be like Roman burn'd Or to Egyptian mummy turn'd: For I'm determin'd, thou Barbarian! When dead—to be an Antiquarian.” “Prepare, (cried Death,) I cannot stay, I have ten thousand kill'd to-day; And when your small concern is o'er, I shall slay full ten thousand more.” “I know, dread Sir, (it was replied) That you are seldom satisfied. If so impatient, kill the Cat: She has nine lives—remember that; At least, nine minutes you'll employ, Her, and her nine lives to destroy; And while Grimalkin you bespatter, I'll settle this important matter.” But Death pois'd high the fatal dart, And aim'd it at the old Man's heart. “I'll not be burn'd then,” Fungus cries, “I'll be a Mummy—yes—” and dies. The Last Chase. WHEN the fair morn begins to break, From their short sleep the Hunters wake: In hope elate, in spirits gay, They to the woodlands haste away; And, as they chearful pass along, Make the hills echo with their song. SONG. No life's like the Hunter's, no joy like the sport, No pleasures like those of the Chase: We envy not such as are dangling at Court For some fid-faddle pension or place. To the summit of grandeur the proud man may rise, The miser may revel in wealth: While the Chase we pursue, gives constant supplies Of good-fellowship, gladness and health. As the stout pack we follow each trouble of life Is forgotten and left far behind: We know not the names of Contention and Strife, And cast all our cares to the wind. We breathe the keen air, mount the hill, sink the dale, While the swift-flying game is in view: Nor think, for a moment, our pleasures can fail, And laugh at old Death and his crew. But Death, who happen'd to be there, For that same Power is ev'rywhere, Ordered his palfry to be brought; When He, th'unconscious Hunters sought; And, as they carroll'd on their way The expected triumphs of the day, The wily Archer lurk'd unseen, To watch them through the forests green; And waited for the appointed place To wield his dart, and shew his face. But now behold the sport begin!— To the loud Hunters' cheering din— To the hounds animating cry The hills and dales and woods reply. The Deer, unharbour'd from the brake, Does, from his sides, the dew-drops shake; And, springing from his leafy bed, Tosses aloft his branchy head: Makes a short, fearful pause, to hear The dreadful concert in his rear: Then, o'er the lawn he swiftly flies, And to the distant covert hies. Poor fugitive, he flies in vain, Or through the wood, or o'er the plain; Shoots down the steep, or skims the vale; For still the alarming sounds prevail. The cunning pack, to Nature true, With certain steps his flight pursue. As the scent more familiar grows, With livelier force their ardor glows: The Hunters' cheer along the glade, And vocal is the Sylvan shade. On some high brow he turns to view, As his sides pant, the clam'rous crew: Now joins the herd, where late he reign'd, And all a monarch's rights maintain'd; But when they see him press'd with woe No more their former Lord they know; But, from his danger quickly fly, Or drive him to his destiny. He now, half-spent, regains the wood, Or plunges in the running flood: Each brake he tries, and traces o'er Those haunts he knew so well before, Where he had led the herd to graze In better times, and happier days; When Peace beam'd o'er the Sylvan reign, Nor hounds nor horns disturb'd the plain. What shall he do, or whither fly;— His strength is gone—the foe is nigh: He lifts his weary limbs with pain, That scarce their tott'ring load sustain, One effort more in vain he tries,— The hounds o'ertake him—and he dies. The horns breathe forth the plaintive strain, Whose notes proclaim—“The deer is slain.” Death follow'd on his courser pale, Up the steep hill, or through the dale: But, 'till the fatal hour drew nigh, He veil'd himself from ev'ry eye. 'Twas then his horrid shape appear'd, And his shrill voice the Hunters heard: With his fell dart he points the way, Th'astonish'd Hunters all obey, Nor can they stop the Courser's speed, Nor can they shun the deadly deed; But follow, with impetuous force, The potent Phantom's mortal course Down the steep cliff.—The Chase is o'er— The Hunters fall—to rise no more. Thus 'tis with man: whate'er his views, Whate'er the game that he pursues; Whether he seeks th'Imperial sway, Whose sceptre myriads obey; Or strives to place the glitt'ring plume Of martial glory on his tomb; Or, to attain the golden store, Does distant seas and realms explore; Courts ev'ry toil, and thinks it sweet To eat the bread, the careful eat; Or yields to Passion's stormy power, Or basks in Virtue's sunshine hour:— Whether the Mausoleums rise, Whose pinnacles assail the skies, And to far distant times proclaim The honour of a Patriot's name:— What though the Cypress' mournful shade Darkens the spot where Beauty's laid; Or the clear verdure of the sod Protects the Peasant's last abode; Still Fate pursues—still mortals fly, The chase continues till they die.— Howe'er they live, where'er they fall, Death—Mighty Hunter—earths them all! The Statesman. IT is not wealth, it is not power Can give to Life a ling'ring hour: When Death commands, whose potent sway All creatures that have life obey, Monarchs must lay their sceptres down, And yield the splendour of a crown; For ever quit the suppliant crowd, And change the purple for a shroud: To-day, the victor laurels bloom, To-morrow—wither on the tomb; Ambition, from its tow'ring height, Sinks to the shades of endless night: The Miser counts his treasure o'er, Then goes to rest—to wake no more. When ebbing Life begins to fail The rosy cheek of youth grows pale; Dimm'd is the lustre of the eye, And set the teeth of ivory. What, though we reach the heights of Fame, Or boast of Honour's proudest name: What, though the minstrel pleasures wait With tuneful accents at our gate; Though to Parnassian height we soar, Or dive profound in Learning's lore, Fate hovers o'er Life's varied throng, And dust to dust concludes the song. 'Tis then, that Vice appall'd, dismay'd, At Death's impenetrable shade, Would give its all, if that could save, From the deep horrors of the grave. 'Tis then, that Virtue rides sublime Above the misty scenes of Time: 'Tis then, the sainted spirit flies To happier climes, and purer skies. “Statesman, awake thee from the dream Of boundless wealth, of power supreme: For know, proud man! that I am come To call thee to thy destin'd home: To bid thee quit thy gorgeous state, And yield thee to the will of Fate.” Thus whisper'd Death, as he was seen To peep behind the gilded screen, With all the well-bred etiquette Claim'd by a great man's Cabinet. The Statesman shudder'd with affright When he beheld th'unwelcome sprite: But, soon recovering, thus address'd, The Fears and Wishes of his breast. “I know thee well; and that 'tis vain To strive thy purpose to restrain, By any pow'r that Time can give: But still it is my wish to live, And when my reasons I impart, You may, perhaps, withdraw your dart, So that you fill your murd'rous hour, It boots not whether men in pow'r, Or their vile Lacquies are your prey: When dead—no better we than they. For once, dread Sir, the great man spare, And take the rogue behind his chair: Nay, I would thank you, as you're able, To sweep those Messieurs from the table: For, in their bosoms may be found Things that were better under ground If I'm to live, 'twere just as well That there should be no tales to tell; Besides, if you will deign to hear, I'll to your int'rest make it clear That, if you bring me to my end, You'll lose a very useful Friend.” Money, that forms the potent bribe For the world's mercenary tribe, From North to South, from East to West, Man's cherish'd and most welcome guest; Whose hope doth ev'ry heart pervade, Of Time the universal Trade; Though lov'd while Life retains its breath, Cannot arrest the hand of Death. Did I the mines of Chili hold, Or rivers rich in flowing gold, The glitt'ring offer would be vain: You would the splendid boon disdain. Here am I sending off supplies, To purchase Friends and quicken Spies; But Death I cannot subsidize. A nation's treasures I controul, Of an Exchequer's wealth the soul; But 'tis not by such petty dealing I can awake your nobler feeling: To your Ambition I apply To speak these words—“Thou shalt not die: “I'll check the purpose of my spear, “And leave you to a future year.” Since I have held the scales of power, From the first moment to this hour, My Policy's commanding word Unsheath'd the necessary sword; And Battle, by my councils led, Beholds the bleeding heaps of dead. I've check'd th'ignoble cry of Peace, And thus your gloomy realms increase; While daily Mausoleums rise As altars for your sacrifice. Strike me—and some weak, timid fool, May, by mischance, be call'd to rule: Who will not dare to mount the car, And call a Nation's sons to war. Your banquet is th'embattled plain, There the prime glories of your reign. —Vain is, I know, the loaded coffer: War is the bribe I have to offer.” Like all, whom Fortune has made great, I wish to keep th'important seat; Nay, I confess, it is my plan T'enjoy the good things while I can, And much I strive to shape my station To the good wishes of the nation: Nor do I want the proper tools To baffle knaves and govern fools. I well know how to suit the case To please his Lordship, or his Grace. A title here, a pension there, A ribband, or a velvet chair: A taper wand, or some such thing, Will most men to my purpose bring. The views of my aspiring soul Have not yet reach'd the wish'd for goal. Much added greatness I've in view, And many a stately thing to do: Nor have I yet enroll'd my name In the bright register of Fame: Nor are my schemes for public glory Matur'd to shine in future story. The world well knows I've labour'd hard, Nor yet obtain'd my fair reward. —To you each secret I reveal:— The patent has not pass'd the seal, Which a new-titled name prepares For me, and my ennobled heirs. I also mean to build a college For the increase of useful knowledge. My well-weigh'd plans, my various schemes Are not, believe me, idle dreams; And, 'twere a pity thus to spoil The blessings of my patriot toil: For Power and Wealth, well understood, Have such vast means of doing good. Then let me stay, till some disaster Tells me to quit my Royal Master; Or, till I'm forc'd, by Party Rage, From off the Ministerial Stage; And when my state and power forsake me, I'll thank you, then, to come and take me.” “I'll take you now!”—the Spectre said. He spoke:—the fatal jav'lin sped.— —The Statesman's number'd with the dead.— Tom Higgins. HOW few, alas, are to be found In this world's ever-varying round, Who, to their real interest true, Keep that thing, Common Sense, in view. How many, by their passions led, By some fallacious phantom fed With airy hope and empty dream, Run on through Life from scheme to scheme; And though they shun the shoals of ruin, Though Fortune smiles on all they're doing, Yet find, at last, their time mispent, As they have never found Content. Though Power and Wealth may be obtain'd, It follows not that they have gain'd The chearful heart, th'approving hour Which far outweigh both wealth and power. That Sense which suits the means to ends, And keeps our deeds and conscience friends, Though sometimes caught in Folly's snare, Fails not the error to repair. It may not make us rich, 'tis true, Nor deal out Pomp and Retinue: But when it gives food, cloaths and fire, Reason will little more require; And, when Time brings us to the last, Sheds not a tear on what is past. Tom Higgins was a Bricklayer's Lad, 'Twas the profession of his Dad; And soon he learn'd, with ready art, To make the trowel play its part; The lofty ladder would ascend, A chimney, or a roof to mend: To do his duty was his plan, As he grew up to be a man. What though he labour'd all day long, He cheer'd his labours with a song; And carrol'd forth his tunes so sweet, That people listen'd in the street. Whatever was the time of day, Somewhat he had to sing or say: Whate'er he did, where'er he went, His words and looks bespoke content; But though he seem'd devoid of art, Tom was a knowing one at heart; And, taught by œconomic sages, He always sav'd one half his wages. Nor did he cease to nurse the notion That industry would gain promotion; That, aided by mechanic skill, T'would tempt Dame Fortune to his will. His hopes were by such fancies cheer'd: For, looking round him, it appear'd That men, no better than himself, Had gain'd in time large stores of pelf; That Bricklayers, Masons and Surveyors, Had turn'd to Aldermen and Mayors. At length, Tom chang'd his course of life: Engag'd in trade, and took a wife. By a good character he won Papa's consent to be his son; While, by his tunefulness and laughter, He gain'd the favour of the daughter. Now he no longer was content To raise a simple battlement; No longer anxious for the gain Of laying brick-work in a drain: A more important line he sought: Houses he jointly built, and bought; Nay, he had somehow learn'd to waste The gay man's wealth in works of taste; So, that when sixty years had spread Their hoary honours on his head, As many thousand pounds were known, In good Bank-stock, to be his own. —But Tom, who as his wealth increas'd Might give, but ne'er refus'd a feast, Had swell'd his well-lin'd belly out, So that he scarce could move about: And one day as he sat and sigh'd O'er his protuberance—'twas replied By his kind Spouse, his mind to ease, In some such arguments as these. “My dearest dear, you well must know, That 'tis, at least, five years ago, Since I have urg'd you to forbear This tiresome life of toil and care. Rich beyond what we wish to spend, Why strive for more, my good old friend? We have no sons who want our aid, To furnish them the means of trade; We have no daughters to demand A tempting fortune at our hand: Besides, I ask—who are we here? We move but in a common sphere. Let us to House and Lands retire, When I a Lady—you a 'Squire, May in that fair condition live, Which money, sure, was made to give.” 'Twere needless now, to stop and state The progress of this kind debate: Where good sense, and good humour meet, Contention's short—Compliance sweet. He yielded soon to her desire, To house and lands they both retire: A Lady she—and he a 'Squire. All things arrang'd, the coach-and-four Drove from the Town's deserted door; And, with due speed, convey'd them strait, Just thirty miles from Hyde-Park gate. When they arriv'd, the village crowd View'd the new 'Squire, and humbly bow'd. He, smiling, bore his weight along, And humm'd the burden of a song: When Madam, in more stately pace, Pass'd on with condescending grace. The village bells, in cadence sweet, With many a peal th'arrival greet; While the good Vicar and his Spouse Receive them at the Manor-house. For the first week or so, the 'Squire Did nought but chuckle and admire.— The Mansion pleas'd—he hobbled round it; Wind-tight, and water-tight, he found it: So well dispos'd in every line, It might have been his own design. But, he car'd not for fragrant flowers, Or rippling brooks or rosy bowers; And for the trees, so finely grown, He only wish'd to cut them down. But soon, alas, he found it true, That he had nothing now to do. To eat and drink and smoke and sleep, Were all the pleasures he could reap; In short, he soon began to tire Of being turn'd into a 'Squire. There was no club where folks might prate Of passing things, and mend the state: No public feasts, where loyal souls Might speechify o'er flowing bowls. To him it was a perfect labour To pay a visit to a neighbour. Indeed, so bulky was he grown, That he weigh'd five-and-twenty stone; And long had lost the active power To mount into an upper floor: So that, when Madam chose to roam, She left him slumbering at home. At length, wheel'd forth in easy chair, His sole delight was to repair To a small, shaded Inn, that stood Contiguous to the Turnpike-road: There he would eat, and drink and smoke, And with the merry Curate joke: For, though so chang'd in form and feature, He still retain'd his pleasant nature: And, as he took the brimming glass, Was pleas'd to see the coaches pass: Nor did he hesitate to own He envied those which went to town, And long'd to be at Islington. “Nay, there I'll go once more,” he said, “But that won't be till I am dead: “For wheresoe'er fat Tom shall die, “At Islington his bones shall lie. “There, there, when I was young and poor, “I smok'd my pipe at Ale-house door: “And now, nor can I Fortune blame, “When old and rich I do the same; “And all the good that pass'd between, “Will be as if it ne'er had been. “But still, I trust, whene'er it ends, “Death and Tom Higgins will be friends.” He spoke, and strait a gentle sleep Did o'er his yielding senses creep. The pipe's last, ling'ring whiff was o'er, The hand could hold the tube no more; It fell, unheeded, on the floor. Death then appear'd, with gentle tread; Just shew'd his dart, and whisp'ring said, “Spirits, to your protection take him:— “For nothing in this world can wake him.” The Shipwreck. HOW proud the boast, that warlike glory Fills such a page in British story; And, from old England's early date, Blazon'd her fame, and made her great; When the stern Henries bravely fought; When the brave Edwards sternly sought, On martial plains, well-earn'd renown, And with the laurel deck'd their crown. But after many an age was o'er New glories rose unknown before; And the brave Britons made the sea A scene of equal victory. Still as th'exulting pen records, In grateful phrase and glowing words, The fame that crowns the British brave, Or in the field or on the wave, In accents sad it mourns the slain Who feed the deep or strew the plain. The word is given, the Lapwing sails, With joyful shouts and fav'ring gales: The Vessel, trimm'd in warlike pride, Dances upon the rolling tide: In a few hours it sees no more The white cliffs of Britannia's shore. To Biscay's bay their course they steer, And dread no threat'ning perils near; For Britons never danger see When they behold an enemy. Nor had they, yielding to the wind, Left, for three days, the coast behind, When lo, a stranger sail appears:— The sight each sailor's bosom cheers; For soon they hop'd to join the cry, So often heard, of Victory, But lo, a furious storm arose, More terrible than any foes. Borne rapidly before the blast, The rolling clouds the day o'ercast: The Ocean curls, the winds arise, And a deep gloom o'erwhelms the skies. The boist'rous squall the canvas tears; The lightning's forky flash appears. Fierce, and more fierce the tempest blew: The waves with foam the deck bedew. Now rising high, now sinking low, The billows in succession flow; And, when the Sun withdraws his light, New horrors wait upon the night. No glimm'ring ray is seen around, And moon and stars in shade are drown'd. No more is view'd the neighb'ring land;— The ship denies the helm's command: Onward she wildly drives: the prow Plunges into the depths below; Then, boldly rising, seems to fly, As if she dar'd assault the sky; When, 'mid the Ocean's horrid roar, She dashes on the fatal shore; And rocking now, from side to side, Through op'ning chasms drinks the tide. The light returns, but 'tis to shew The dismal scene of hopeless woe: The rising Sun, behind a cloud Shrinks, as afraid to view the flood, Where fierce and warring tempests reign As if 'twould ne'er be calm again. The hopeless crew for mercy crave, As they behold their wat'ry grave. Some cling about the floating mast, Some on the pointed crags are cast, There struggle till they breathe their last. Others, on mountain billows tost, Brave ev'ry danger—and are lost. Two of the gallant crew alone, Who on the rocky coast were thrown, Surviv'd, in anguish deep, to mourn That they had 'scap'd life's briny bourn; While their sad eyes behold around, The wreck—the dying—and the drown'd. All-bruis'd, exhausted, faint and weak, The shelter of a rock they seek; There sit them down to rest; but there, Instead of hope, they find despair. A savage wildness mark'd the place: No signs were there, the eye could trace, That foot of man had ever trod The dreary, desolate abode. It was a spot, where nought could thrive: Where nothing that had life could live. Impending rocks the place surround, And form a bold, impervious bound, Where the aspiring eagle's flight Alone can reach the tow'ring height: Beneath, the foaming billows roar And ceaseless lash the craggy shore. There the brave boatswain, and his mate, Thus talk'd o'er their untimely fate. Boatswain. “We have, my Boy, long sail'd together, In fair, in foul, in every weather. At Aboukir, we join'd the cry Of Nelson's glorious victory; And, on Trafalgar's splendid day, We saw the British flag display It's triumphs, on th'astonish'd Main, O'er the best hopes of France and Spain. Or when the gales but gently blew, With some delightful shore in view; And when the Moon's pale, silv'ry light Gave its mild beauties to the night, We have in social converse join'd, And talk'd of those we left behind; Or careless chaunted forth the stave:— The Ocean is the Sailor's Grave. But now the waves the Lapwing swallow, And we, old Joe, must quickly follow. From this same Cove, there's no retreating: The cliffs are high, the waves are beating; There's nothing here to cut and carve; And faith, I'd rather drown than starve. The next tide bears us from the shore, And then our voyage will be o'er: We both shall sink, to rise no more; And with our gallant messmates sleep, All in the bosom of the deep. Whether a shot should lay us low, Or the sharp weapon's fatal blow; Or driven on the rocky coast, Our ship is wreck'd and all is lost; We rest beneath the stormy wave:— The Ocean is the Sailor's Grave: And e'er the Sun deserts the sky, There, my good fellow, we shall lie. 'Tis not the way I'd chuse—but still, We must submit to his high will Who sits aloft; and he knows best The Haven where we ought to rest.” Joe. “If as you say, things must be so, 'Tis vain to make complaints, you know: Though cast beneath this lofty rock, I think of Mary, at the Dock. I feel the sinking at my heart When she and I were forc'd to part: For when she wept upon the shore, I thought I ne'er should see her more— I somehow fancied, that 'twere vain To hope I should return again. Alas, dear girl, she ne'er will know What is become of faithful Joe: For not a soul will live to tell The sad disaster that befell The Lapwing; who, the other day, Left Plymouth Sound so trim and gay. Though without shelter from the storm, And starv'd with cold, my heart is warm; Nor from its course will ever vary, While it can beat, and think on Mary. But since my ev'ry hope is o'er, And I shall see dear Moll no more; Come, Death, and ease me of my pain, Oh plunge me in the stormy main: Hear my last prayer, and be my friend, And let my life and suff'rings end.” He spoke; and lo! before him sat The summon'd Messenger of Fate. “Ah! thou art there; (the Seaman said), I know thee well—but who's afraid? I fear'd thee not, when, at my gun, I've seen the mischief thou hast done, Upon the deck, from helm to prow; And, faith, I do not fear thee now; But yield me to thy friendly power, And welcome this my final hour.” —Death wav'd his arm:—with furious shock, The billows dash'd against the rock; Then, with returning force, they bore The helpless victims from the shore: There sinking, 'neath the foaming wave— The Sailors found—the Sailor's Grave. The Virago. WHAT is the richest boon in life? I say, a fond and faithful wife; Whose form is fair, whose temper's cool, Who never wants to play the fool: Who knows, and who performs her duty, Nor thinks, because she's born a beauty, That, from her youth till she grows old, She may both domineer and scold. —O happy he! whose wedded life Ne'er knew domestic feud or strife; Who, from the partner of his heart, Ne'er heard the word that could impart A keen reproach, a painful thought; Who, with her marriage portion, brought A far more precious gem than e'er The neck adorns, or decks the hair; Which shines so bright in all degrees;— The never-failing wish to please. Not so the Fair One of the story Which this bold page now lays before you. Mistress Pengethly was a Lady Who long ago had pass'd her hey-day: A spoil'd and only daugther she Of a proud Dame of Family, Who was, if you would take her word, The twentieth Cousin of a Lord. Her husband also, when he died, Had left her his whole stock of pride; For, having been High-sheriff, he Became, poor man, as proud as she: But as for wealth, a mod'rate share Remain'd for Wife and Female Heir. Horses and hounds, and jolly doing, Had almost brought the 'Squire to ruin; When, to escape this dire disgrace, He clos'd, one night, his mortal race. The house, the mortgag'd lands were sold, Madam and Miss no more behold The liv'ried train obedient wait Behind their chair, or at their gate; Compell'd, but not content, to own A Villa in a Country Town; Whose household state alone display'd A curly foot-boy and a maid: Where nought of finery was seen But a Veranda, pink and green; While humble neighbours as they pass, Admire the drap'ry, through the glass, Whose folds in wide luxuriance spread, With fringe and tassels blue and red. Here they deplor'd their hapless fate, Their lowly fall and humbled state: Chang'd the Barouche and four bright bays For, now-and-then, an hired chaise: From the world exil'd and the ton, In their small house they liv'd alone, Almost unseen, and quite unknown; And, which is no uncommon lot, By all their former friends forgot. But it has been observ'd by men, Who wrote it with a knowing pen, That Pride, whatever ill o'ertakes us, Is the last feeling that forsakes us; And, beat in every other part, Still keeps the fortress of the heart. Thus, to the Vicar's humble wife, They'd talk of fashionable life, And number up, among their cousins, Ladies and Duchesses by dozens; Would quite surprize her with the story Of all their former days of glory; And then, in pride, return again To some uneasy, cheerless strain— “My daughter, who, in shape and feature, “Is a bright Paragon of Nature: “Form'd in the highest ranks to shine, “I say it, though the girl is mine, “Yet is she doom'd to pass her hour, “Like some unheeded, beauteous flower “That never is expos'd to view, “And fades away where first it grew. “Augusta sings, but no one hears her; “Augusta plays, but no one cheers her; “Augusta smiles, but no one sees:— “We might as well be shrubs and trees! “Such is our dull, inactive state, “We little more than vegetate. “What do we see in this poor town? “Scarce any faces but our own; “Unless, a rare and lucky chance, “Of trav'ller gay we catch a glance.” Dear Mistress Goodly, who had heard Her husband preach the sacred word, That doth the voice of comfort speak To those who, with devotion, seek In heav'nly mercy the relief That's sure to heal our mortal grief; Would say 'twas wisdom to submit To what the Powers above thought fit; And Patience taught in humble phrase, With cheering hope of better days: That Happiness doth not depend Upon the wealth we have to spend; That oft, the rich, with all their store, Are not so happy as the poor; That soon or late pale Death will come To call them to one common Home; And then, the great event will rest, Not on the rich, but on the best. —Thus when her Sermon she had done, Had curtsied, and was fairly gone, She furnish'd both Mamma and Daughter, With an whole evening full of laughter. —But, to be brief—these clouds were soon Converted to an Honey Moon. 'Tis oft the case that birth decay'd Affects to scorn the Sons of Trade; And yet, at length, will join the train Of City Dames in Mincing Lane: Augusta too forgot her pride, And sunk into a Merchant's Bride. It happen'd, just about this time, That, as the year was in its prime. Mr. Pengethly travell'd down To strut about his native Town: —He was a Tradesman of renown:— When waggish Cupid, from his quiver Drew forth a dart and pierc'd his liver; Or, in his breast, 'tis much the same, Augusta's charms rais'd such a flame; So fierce it burn'd that, from her eye, The sentence beam'd to live or die. What, though her fortune was but small, Her Mother said—'twas none at all: Because she thought th'enamour'd Cit Would take it out in charms and wit; For Love had quench'd his wish for pelf;— The treasure was Augusta's self. He sought no more; the point was carried, And John Pengethly soon was married. The bells ne'er ceas'd throughout the day; The Bridegroom ne'er was seen so gay. The Bride appear'd with blushing grace, Cover'd with muslin, silk and lace. The Banquet follow'd—and the Ball:— John drew his purse and paid for all. At length his town acquaintance greet The married pair in Fenchurch Street. He smil'd and smirk'd, but many thought He had not done the thing he ought; And e'er three months had said adieu, Why, he began to think so too. The Lady was both young and pretty, But then she did not like the City. She lov'd expence, and he was saving; She was for ev'ry pleasure craving; And his great object was to sow His money, and to see it grow. She, whose soft words and modest charms Fill'd his fond bosom with alarms, When in the Country first he lov'd;— In Town a fierce Virago prov'd. In short, as we may well suppose, They now were friends, and then were foes. John's face was sometimes seen to bleed; 'Twas a bad razor did the deed:— Though chatt'ring folks and loving friends, Would say—'twas Madam's fingers ends. He in his bus'ness sought relief, And getting money sooth'd his grief; He found the bargain he had made In marriage, was a losing trade: But his experience did suggest,— Of a bad bargain make the best. All have their common cares in life, And he had got a scolding wife: Though, in the matrimonial firm, 'Tis Death alone dissolves the term; Or something that's unfit to name, A deadly foe to female fame; And she had never wish'd to rove From the chaste bounds of lawful love. —He felt with pride his word was good, That, on firm base, his credit stood; In ev'ry mart he could command The richest stores of ev'ry land; And this with patience made him bear The burthen of domestic care. At home, 'twas true, a secret smile From Molly could that care beguile, And he would give a squeeze or more To Molly when she op'd the door. She knew his rap, and took good care, With nimble step, to meet him there. Now, as one night, he cheerless sat With his cross-rib in bick'ring chat, The Watchman cried—past twelve o'clock, When the door rattled with a knock; And Molly enter'd, pale with fear— “There's one who wants my Mistress here: “But such a figure, Ma'am, that, sure, “Your eyes will ne'er the sight endure.” DEATH enter'd as the damsel spoke Pengethly trembled—Madam shook; Away the Shape his Victim bore; And, as he dragg'd her from the door, She rav'd and threaten'd, kick'd and swore; Then call'd the Watch:—but soon the riot Was heard no more—and all was quiet. Pengethly follow'd to the gate, Submissive to the will of Fate. “Farewell, (he cried) my dearest dear!— “As I no more shall see you here, “To my fond wish it may be given, “That we shall meet again in Heaven; “And since your daily clamours cease, “On earth I hope to live in peace.— “DEATH, far away, my cares hath carried.— “Molly,—to-morrow we'll be married.” The Glutton. AMONG those vices which the Law Does not controul or keep in awe, Which look not to the grave intent Of any Act of Parliament; Are subject to no other rule Than what is taught in Reason's school, But, straying from her general plan, Degrade the character of Man; Among them all, who can descry A vice more mean than Gluttony? Of any groveling slave of sense, Not one can claim so small pretence To that indulgence which the wise Allow to human frailties, As the inglorious, beastly sinner, Whose only object is—a dinner. The Miser, who heaps up his store, May prove a Treasurer for the poor; And, by his avarice, prepare The funds by which his gen'rous heir Can, with unbounded grace, impart The kindness of a feeling heart. —The thoughtless, but the jovial souls, Who pleasure find in flowing bowls, Enjoy the day, or pass the nights In Bacchanalian delights:— Though their excesses do not give The happiness for which we live: Yet, round their table mirth prevails, And Humour laughs, though Reason fails. Scourge me the man who dares to say The belly claims superior sway, And, in the various scale of sense, Can boast a fair pre-eminence; Whose pleasure lies in luscious meats, And reasons only while he eats; On whom the subject never palls Of poult'rers' shops and butchers' stalls; Who scents no odours so bewitching, As sav'ry steams from well-fed kitchen; Who does with real rev'rence look On the perfections of a Cook; Whose gloating eyes view every dish, Of boil'd, and roast, of soup and fish, Of callipash and fatten'd haunch, Till he has fill'd his bloated paunch; And then the rich ragouts restore The stomach, till it holds no more. —For whom does he prepare the feast, And daily play the greedy beast? Nature resents the sensual show, And, sick'ning, often tells him so: She leaves his rav'nous maw to share His banquets with the Scavenger. Such was Sir Gabriel Lamprey, Knight, Who thought that a sharp appetite, With a good dinner, form'd a blessing, Of all life's goods, most worth possessing Wealthy he was—and when Lord Mayor, Did Honour to the City chair: But he had long outliv'd the taste For any pleasure, but a feast: And thus, as folks were us'd to say, He pass'd each regulated day. —The chicken-broth was brought at nine,— He then arose to ham and wine; And, with a philosophic air, Decided on the Bill of Fare. He took his bitters just at two, To give his appetite its cue; The coach then drew up to the door, And gave him exercise till four. At five the steady bell inform'd That dinner's ready to be storm'd. But a sad day arriv'd at last, When, as he view'd the rich repast, DEATH enter'd, to proclaim a fast; And freely took an empty chair Which happen'd to be standing there. Up starts the Knight, with hideous grin, The napkin dangling from his chin: The Cook, with apprehension big, Drops from his hands the roasted pig; The women scream'd, the dishes chatter'd; The floor with sauce was all bespatter'd; When the Knight thought 'twere best be civil, And hold the candle to the Devil. “Do lay that ugly dart aside: “A knife and fork shall be supplied. “Come, change your glass for one of mine, “That shall appear brimfull of wine. “Perhaps you're hungry, and may feel “A hankering to make a meal; “So without compliment or words, “Partake of what the house affords.” “Avaunt,” cried Death, “no more ado:— “I'm come to make a meal of you.” The Recruit. Serjeant. LET the drum's inviting sound Call the brave, gallant youth around, From the wood-side and the vale, And shaded hamlet in the dale: Let them listen to my story, Of War's renown—of Death and Glory. By me, your noble King commands His loyal people's hearts and hands. Hear, my fine Lads, th'inspiring word; And change your sickles for the sword. Let coward spirits meanly toil, To sow the seed or plough the soil: Let others reap the ripen'd grain; Harvests of honour he'll obtain, Who seeks the pointed spear to wield, And gather Fame in tented Field. Let the drum's enliv'ning sound Inspire the village heroes round.” “I'm tir'd,” said Tom, “of this same home, And oft have long'd abroad to roam. I like the rattle of the drum; And, Serjeant, to enlist I'm come. Nay, while its noise the women fright, Egad, it makes me long to fight; And all, within the hundred, know, That I can give a sturdy blow. Ay, and, at cudgel-playing, I Have often gain'd the victory. O let me to the wars be led!— I long to break a Frenchman's head. So Master Serjeant, thus I say; I'll follow where you lead the way. I to the battle wish to go, To serve my King and fight the foe. Such is my word; so here's my hand; And I'll obey as you command.” “Take not my Son,” the Father cried; The Mother wept, the Sister sigh'd: “And Thomas, is it thus you prove,” Molly exclaim'd “your plighted love.” “Let not,” he said, “your sorrows flow, I'm listed, Girl, and I must go, Whether it pleases you, or no. But, Molly, when you see me come, From foreign lands, victorious home, It then will be my honest pride, To make my Love a Soldier's bride.” “Dry up your tears,” the Serjeant said, “He now pursues a nobler trade. How will your warm affections burn, To see your lover soon return; The white plume nodding on his crest; The stamp of honour on his breast; Strutting along in martial pride, The sabre dangling by his side. He'll then be worthy of your charms, A Hero then will fill your arms.” “If I were sure he would again,” Says Molly, “view his native plain; I'd smile and, through the ling'ring year, His absence would with patience bear. But much I fear some fatal blow Will lay my much-lov'd Thomas low. The Sexton says he knows you well, And 'tis an idle tale you tell: That your recruits are always slain, And never see their homes again. Such are the fears that fill my breast, That ne'er will leave my heart at rest: Such the sad burthen of my story.”— —“Then 'twill, sweet Girl, be Death and Glory!” The Maiden Ladies. WONDERS will never cease, 'tis said, And wond'ring is an ancient trade. But it turn'd out one Winter's night, It was, indeed, a curious sight, Round a warm fire, in that cold weather, That ten old maids had got together: At least, so far they had miscarried, Not one of them had e'er been married. It would be needless to relate, What whimsical, controuling fate, Had kept them in this awkward state. But so it was,—and all the Graces Of vet'ran age had mark'd their faces. But, though they long had ceas'd to charm, They still could flourish an alarm, With that same power which does not fail, While Life can furnish out the tale; That instrument so nicely hung In female form, yclep'd a Tongue. —Miss Stately open'd the Divan, And thus the conversation ran, Upon that Animal call'd Man. “I think that Nature never gave The right he boasts of—to enslave The Sex, to whom this title's given— The last and fairest work of Heaven. Yet, from the cradle's wimp'ring hour, Till Fate deprives him of his power, He claims an arbitrary sway, Which woman lives but to obey. And if a female should inherit A just and a becoming spirit; If by her sound, superior sense, She scoffs at his omnipotence, The men exclaim, how fierce and bold! O what a termagant and scold! While the good husband who thinks fit, As it becomes him, to submit, And is, at all times, kind and meek, Is stigmatis'd, a Jerry Sneak. —“I have attain'd, as it appears, The rev'rend age of threescore years, And all that time it is my pride, I never wish'd to be a bride: I've liv'd an independent Life Nor e'er would be that thing,—a Wife. I know not what they mean who tell, That we shall manage apes in Hell; But this I know, that no dull Fool, Or Fashion's Macaroni Tool; No hunting Blade, who, from October To closing March, is ever sober; No wealthy Cit of grov'ling birth, Has made me lead a Hell on earth. —“Hear Lady Formalton relate The pleasures of a marriage state. Money and beauty both she gave To be a noble husband's slave. A Lady then in coach-and-six, But what of that—, she could not fix The fondness of her Lordly Elf, Who thought of nothing but himself. In pride and pomp, and grave display, The solemn years pass'd slow away; With scarce, she says, one merry day; Till, by a Phthisic in his breast, The proud old Peer was sent to rest. Freedom now came to dry the tear, With a good jointure in the rear: But soon the brood of children vex her, The boys disturb, the girls perplex her. The one their various whims pursue: The others sing,—Who comes to woo? The gay young Lord's a dupe at play, And Miss Amelia runs away: While she in this uneasy state, Leaves them to Fortune and to Fate. Such she describes her wedded Life, And oft amid its stately strife, When, bending to its stern decree, Aye, often has she envied Me. Scarce a day vanish'd, but she said, I wish that I were still a Maid.” “Thoughts,” said Miss Prim, “more just or true, I never heard, not e'en from you; Whose sense and knowledge stand confest, Among the wisest and the best. At cards it is the self-same scene; Behold the Fate of this poor Queen: Vain all the power that she can bring— She yields submissive to the King.” Miss Mustard, with sarcastic smile, Could not such reas'nings reconcile; And thus the lively Lady spoke, But half in earnest, half in joke. “This may be true, which I have heard, With so much dignity preferr'd; But still, I'm ready to suspect That Pride may issue from Neglect; And, when we boast of maiden power, The men may say,—The grapes are sour. What is, has been, and e'en will be, As long as One and Two make Three, Is fix'd by Fate and Destiny. Nay, Reason and Religion too, Declare the doctrine to be true; That, from Creation's earliest hour, Superior Man was cloth'd with power; And women, it was thought most fit, As weaker vessels, should submit. We read of Amazons of old, A female nation fierce and bold, Who, when they met the men, would treat 'em, As foes avow'd, and often beat 'em: But, if Historians sage speak true, They would for friendly parleys sue, And were not quite so chaste as you. —'Tis all fine talk,—but I must own, That I have liv'd so long alone Was not my wish: and, even now, When fifty years have mark'd my brow, I would, could I command my fate, With pleasure quit this chearless state; Nay even, were it to my sorrow, I would a husband take to-morrow; And should rejoice, nor think me light, To be a Bride this very night.” Thus as she spoke, John trembling told, The Visitor they would behold. One clam'rous scream announc'd their fears; When lo!—the horrid shape appears. Amid the universal squalling, Some sunk in chairs, and some were sprawling; And as the Spectre thus display'd His griesly form,—he softly said, “Lady, I take you at your word, And granted is the suit preferr'd. 'Tis Fate commands, and I with pride, Embrace Miss Mustard as my Bride. A well-appointed hearse-and-four Attends her pleasure at the door. The marriage ceremonies wait Her presence at the Church-yard gate: My Lanthern shines with nuptial light; The bells in muffled peal, invite,— And She, shall be,—a Bride to Night.” The Quack Doctor. WHAT is the choicest boon of Heaven, That to frail mortal man is given; To cheer his heart and gild his way Through passing Life's uncertain day? Ambition will at once exclaim, Raise me to station and to name: Give me Power and give me State, Content I'll leave the rest to fate. Pale Avarice, with grasping hand, Will quick reply,—let me command The fountain from whence riches flow: No other joy I seek to know. Call forth the minstrels, let them play The enchanting music through the day; Let but the sensual spirits wait And ask admittance at my gate; Let but the feast prolong delight, And give a blaze to gloomy night: Thus let me live till life is o'er, Pleasure proclaims,—I ask no more. How vain, how impotent the plan That oft is form'd by thoughtless man, His transient, fickle hours to bless, With a false dream of happiness! —If pain assaults the splendid throne, Does not the scepter'd Monarch groan? If raging Fever's burning heat Compels the hurried pulse to beat; If the cold Ague shakes the frame, And shudd'ring Limbs its force proclaim;— If the tormented bosom strains With Hectic's agitating pains;— In short, whatever the disease,— Will power, will riches give us ease? While Pleasure, trembling with affright, From the sick chamber takes its flight. What then's the choicest boon of Heaven, Which to frail, mortal man is given, To cheer his heart and gild his way Through passing Life's uncertain day; Superior far to power and wealth? The answer is at hand;—'Tis Health. O Nymph divine, without thy power, Life cannot know a joyous hour: If thou art absent, what can give, A cheerful thought, a wish to live. Nature must sicken soon and die, Without thy active energy. Where'er you hold your genial reign, The squallid family of pain Take their compell'd, unwilling flight, To the dark realms of dreary night; And grateful vot'ries resume Th'enliven'd eye, the native bloom, Med'cine's thy handmaid, when the sage Experience calls it to assuage The morbid evils that inflame Man's fine-spun, irritable frame;— When Science doth direct the art Of healing to each suff'ring part; When he, in Æsculapian School, Well-taught, ne'er deviates from the rule Founded on maxims tried and sure, Which give the fairest hopes of cure.— Such are the steady foes of Death Who oft recall the flitting breath: But though, at length, their art must yield, And to the Tyrant quit the field; They oft prolong Life's final date, And check the eager hand of Fate. Not so the mercenary race, Pretenders ignorant and base, Who live upon the daring lie Of Universal Remedy;— But yet possess the active sense, By their low arts and impudence, To gull the foolish, who are found In ev'ry quarter to abound: For such th'enquiring eye may greet In the proud square and humble street, Who help to feed, as we may see, These miscreants of Quackery. —Do, for a curious moment, pop Your head into that splendid shop, Where the gilt vases, in a row, Form such a gay and motley show; With labell'd bottles to explain The compounds which they ne'er contain: Where Juleps, Anodynes and Pills Are seen prepar'd to cure all ills That do infect the human frame, Whate'er their nature or their name. —Of this grand shop behold the Master, Who deals in Bolus, Pill and Plaister. See how his Visage he disposes, As his hands measure out the doses; While his round paunch most truly tells, He never takes the Drugs he sells. Sometimes he cures the astonish'd Elf, By leaving Nature to herself: Sometimes, by Chance, he doth appease The raging torments of disease; Or, with the drug's enliv'ning power, Plays on the Fancy's gloomy hour. These in ev'ry form proclaim The healing wonders of his name, While he conceals, with subtle art, The slaughters that deserve a Cart. —'T'were well were we to turn an ear, And listen to what's passing there.— “Doctor, I'm old, and full of ills, “And, for Apothecary's bills, “Alas, I've paid them o'er and o'er, “And am resolv'd to pay no more.—” —“And so, at last, you're come to me, “Just like the rest,—but where's my fee?”— “There, take it, Sir,—I'm eighty-five, “And scarce can keep myself alive.” “You cough, I see, and are opprest, “Your breathing too affects your breast; “Your sleep's disturb'd throughout the night, “And you have lost your appetite: “Your limbs are weak, your nerves unstrung, “And you are now no longer young. “Such is your case, and I believe, “'Twill yield to this Carminative. “Among my Med'cines 'tis the best; “The Printed Bill explains the rest. “But if it should not ease your pain, “Why then—why, you must come again.” “But I love ale:—must I forsake it?”— —“No,—'tis a balmy fluid,—take it.” —“Will Gin and Water do me harm?”— —“'Twill do you good; but take it warm.”— —“My case you clearly understand: “The ablest Doctor in the land!— —“I really am so very weak, “That my tongue faulters as I speak: “Yes, Doctor, I can hardly bring “My voice to tell my suffering.”— —“Your languid state your looks express; “Madam, I feel for your distress. “Do not exert yourself at present: “These Cordial Drops are very pleasant: “And they, I trust, will soon restore “The strength, whose absence you deplore. “Though pale your cheek, and though your eye “Has lost its brisk vivacity, “With which it has been us'd to dart “Its beams to each surrounding heart; “I doubt not I shall soon bestow, “To the wan face its wonted glow; “And e'er a dozen weeks expire, “Those eyes will gain their wonted fire.”— —“But I am not so young you know, “As I was forty years ago.”— —“Forty? for shame;—it may be seen, “'Tis true, that you are not eighteen: “You're ill, but when your looks revive, “I then shall see you thirty-five. “Not more, I'm sure,—and that's an age, “When Beauty still may hearts engage.”— —“Doctor your cheering words impart “Delight to my desponding heart. “O what a wretched life I've led! “I wonder that I am not dead! “'Tis now, I think, three years and more “Since daily to my wearied door, “Some great Physician's chariot roll'd, “Who for his Med'cine took my gold. “One told me that my nerves must feel “The rigid power of bracing steel: “Another, that the tepid wave “Should my tense, outstretch'd fibres lave. “When the warm, heating Med'cines fail'd, “The cooling System then prevail'd. “To Bath and Tunbridge I was sent; “But vain was the experiment. “To Brighton also I have been, “Quaff'd the salt wave and walk'd the Stein; “But, after all the trials past, “You see me here half-dead at last. “Those Cordial Drops, have giv'n me ease, “Another dose, Sir, if you please: “And, as for Med'cines I am come, “I think I'll take a bottle home.”— —“You can't do better:—when you're low, “They soon will make your spirits flow. “These Pills within your chamber keep, “They are decided friends to sleep. “And, at your meals, instead of wine, “Take this digestive Anodyne. “Should you invigoration want, “Employ this fine Corroborant. “These curious Panaceas will, “If well applied, cure ev'ry ill. “So take them home; and read the Bill, “Which, with my signature at top, “Explains the Med'cines of my Shop. “On these you may have firm reliance; “So set the College at defiance. “And should they not your health restore, “You now know where to send for more.”— —“John, call the Carriage to the door.” “The Lady having said Adieu, “I now, Sir, can attend to you. “So Mr. Alderman, relate, “What ails you, and each symptom state”— —“Doctor, I've heard that you're renown'd “By dint of making sick men sound; “And I am in no common fright “Lest I should lose my appetite: “For neither Fish, nor Flesh, nor Stew “Can tempt me as they us'd to do. “But first you'll let me know for certain “Who is the rogue behind the curtain. “He looks as he were made of stone, “With nought for cheeks and chin but bone. “His eyes are dismal, hollow sockets, “As empty as a Poet's pockets. “I see what he's about:—why zounds, “I'll take no drugs that fellow pounds. “I'd better far, to save my bacon, “Go back to those I have forsaken. “And look once more for healing knowledge, “To the grave Sages of the College. “They'll do their best, and I won't thwart em; “I then shall die,—secundum artem; “And not be finish'd by a Dunce “Whose Trade's to kill and cure at once. The Sot. THE various ways which Death contrives, To put an end to human Lives, Would, were they told in prose or song, Make out a tale so very long, That few, aye very few, would lend A kind attention to the end: But e're they reach'd the fiftieth line, Would the dull, tedious work resign. 'Tis how men live, not how they die, That stirs up Curiosity. Our thoughts, our spirits we convene To look upon the living scene. The Actor comes, he plays his part, With Comic or with Tragic art; But if 'tis order'd that he dies, We leave him to his obsequies. And the impatient eye expects The hero that shall enter next. But still my subject bids me state, The whims and phantasies of Fate. For laurell'd Heroes and the brave, Glory oft digs a distant grave, Deep in the blood-besprinkled plain, Cover'd with thousands of the slain, Whose ghastly, mangled forms invite The Vulture to delay his flight. —The scepter'd Monarch yields his crown In state, upon a bed of down; While Poverty doth oft withdraw From life, upon a bed of straw. Some die with hemp around their gullets, And some from balls—and some from bullets: But 'twas the fate of poor Jack Marrow, To breathe his last on a Wheel-barrow. Jack had a jolly Butcher been, No Market had a better seen: Oft had he led the jovial train, In Leadenhall or Honey Lane; But could a courteous visage put on, Beneath suspended legs of mutton: With frock of blue, and shining face, Would welcome all with sprightly grace; And had a certain leering eye To tempt the passenger to buy. He'd glance the knife across the steel, And boast his beef, or vaunt his veal; Talk of lamb's kidnies for a stew, And sweet-breads, what a nice ragout: While shoulders, breasts, and loins and hearts Flow'd from his tongue, by fits and starts. Nor was this all:—he had the skill To manage weights and scales at will; And, by a certain slight of hand, Could a short ounce or two command. Besides, his tongue was so bewitching To all the maids who rul'd the kitchen, That no complaints were ever heard, Where Marrow's daily Tray appear'd. At length, advanc'd in years and warm, In added gains, he bought a farm: He lik'd the mansion as he found it, With just a score of acres round it, Where he might fatten sheep, or graze An added ox, for holidays. Nay, sometimes, to keep up the knack, He'd throw a wether on its back And plunge his knife into the throat, To let the stream of Life run out: Or dress a calf, with knife and steel, Into each well-known form of Veal. But what was this, to when the stall Claim'd ev'ry hour, in Leadenhall. —Thus did Jack live a year or two, But, tir'd of having nought to do, He sold his cattle great and small, And thought the Goat was worth them all. Now this same Goat, I must define, Was nothing better than a Sign, That hung suspended in the air To tell the Country Bill of Fare, Which Village Alehouse doth provide, Throughout the day, by highway side: For it was best to Jack's own thinking To've done with meat and take to drinking: So to the Goat, on toping bent, Or foul or fair, he daily went. The Curate there his pipe would smoke, Now moralize, now crack his joke. The merry Miller would prolong The evening with a cheerful song; And chatt'ring Barber, o'er his ale, Would catch the curious with a tale: There the Exciseman, clad with power, Would dignify the social hour: The trav'lling Pedlar, looking wise, Would rail at Taxes and Excise; While Philpot, with a paunch as round As his own butts, would bow profound. Here, Jack by punch and ale subdued, Smil'd always when they both were good. Here he his copious draughts would take, Or smoke, to keep himself awake, Until his loving wife should come, To guide her stamm'ring toper home. Now she was one of those good wives Who ne'er disturb their husband's lives, But yet, without much grief attend The season when those lives may end. 'Twas, as the Village Annals say, One ev'ning in the month of May, When, as Jack Marrow dosing sat, He yielded to the stroke of Fate; And some confusion spread around When He fell, senseless, to the ground; But Death appear'd—and, on his barrow, Trundled away with poor Jack Marrow. Nor was the party much dismay'd: They plied their jugs, with “Who's afraid!”— —The Curate, who had, in his day, Beheld so many wheel'd away, Calmly look'd on, nor felt much sorrow, For what would bring him Fees to-morrow. Besides, his Dame had made it known, She wish'd to mend her black silk gown; And the shrewd Parson had in view The power to do it; as he knew That scarfs and hatbands did possess The means of aiding Madam's dress. So he look'd calmly on, when Death Put Master Marrow out of breath. —But the fat Landlord shook his head— “If that same Gem'man should be dead, I ought to cry—for, to my cost, The best of customers I've lost; And if he don't this bout escape, Egad, I'll hang the Goat in crape.”— —Thus, let our trade be what it will. Int'rest is apt to sway us still, And he in this world will go down, Who to another yields his own. But Mrs. Marrow strait appears, In all the rage of grief and tears, With what's all this? What are you doing? And where, you Scarecrow, are you going? —Madam, your Husband's time is come; And, as you see, He's going home. His eyes are now for ever closing— —You lie, you thief, He's only dosing; And, if you rob me of the rest, I'll take his wig, for that's his best.— —This instant let your manners mend, Or I'll the fatal stroke suspend: If you continue thus to scold, I will your widowhood with-hold; A worser evil shall betide you, He shall snore ten more years beside you. And if with me you play the shrew, He still shall live to bury you.— —It was my grief, Sir, pray excuse me: Your pardon, Sir, do not refuse me. I feel that I have done amiss; But such a cruel sight as this, So sad, so unexpected too, How could a wife, so fond, so true, Without heart-rending feelings view! And when on such a sight we gaze, Why, Sorrow knows not what it says: Ah, vain would be the Doctor's skill; So I submit me to your will.—” “—Go on before, prepare the way For this same heavy load of clay: Discard his wig, and seize his riches: You now may wear the Dead Man's Breeches.” The Honey Moon. OF all the Follies that disgrace The progress of the human race, Few call for livelier ridicule, Or more distinctly mark the fool, Than when old age attempts to prove, That still it has the power to love.— It asks not youth, it asks not health, To hoard accumulated wealth: To the last stage of lengthen'd years, The love of gold the Miser cheers; And, on the day he tells fourscore, He still can count his treasures o'er.— While Reason lives, the hoary sage May feel that Wisdom crowns his age; And, to Life's most protracted hour, He may enjoy the pride of Power. But Nestor's self a fool would prove, If he should turn his thoughts to love. When Winter's Form, with trembling pace, Attempts a sprightly, vernal grace, Or, with a stamm'ring tongue, to tell, He loves so true—he loves so well; Or bids the blushing roses blow Around his temples white with snow; The careless, playful world may smile; But rigid Reason will revile The wand'ring strange from Nature's plan, And see the Ideot in the Man. Bring me the cap that Folly wears, With jingling bells and lengthen'd ears, And place it on the old man's head Who babbles love, and longs to wed. Youth is the season made for joy; Let Cupid then his power employ; Then all his soft delights improve, While Hymen knits the bands of Love. Sir Peter had grown old, when Fate Depriv'd him of his ancient mate. She was a chaste and careful wife, Whose temper ne'er engender'd strife: For she had that commanding soul Which kept the Knight in due controul. Between them no one ever heard An unkind phrase, an angry word; No one e'er witness'd a dispute; For when she spoke the Knight was mute. Thus pass'd their tranquil life away: When she said yes, he ne'er said nay; And would have thought it much amiss, When she said nay, should he say yes. At length this Dame, so good and kind, Left life—and all the world behind. Sir Peter wept o'er his disaster; But, for the wound, he found a plaister; He felt, at last, that he was Master. But so it is with mortal state; Or high or low, or small or great; Contentment's seldom known to find It's mansion in the human mind; And soon the Knight began to own 'Twas comfortless to live alone; Nay, that to soothe his irksome life, He e'en would take another wife; Would his deep mourning lay aside, Dress himself smart, and get a Bride. No sooner did this tale resound From place to place the country round, But ev'ry grave and maiden Lady Who had escap'd her sprightly heigh-day, Began to think she had a chance Of joining in the nuptial dance. The Widows too began to dream Of a new matrimonial scheme; But the old Knight had nought to say To Maidens grave, or Widows gay: He fill'd the neighbourhood with laughter, By fixing on a Lawyer's daughter. Miss Julia Docket had not seen Of Summer seasons quite nineteen; And 'twas not often that the Spring Of life produced a fairer thing. She had been taught, by rod and rule, The graces of a Boarding-school: Was of a country town the boast, And of each neighb'ring 'Squire the toast. But Julia had contriv'd to part With that same Trinket call'd a Heart, And it was now consign'd to rest Within a gallant Major's breast; Who, at the time, was trav'lling far 'Midst scenes of glory and of war. But Love—when faithful, just and true, Our worldly interest may subdue: So, when Sir Peter paid his vows And ask'd her to become his spouse, She star'd awhile—then off she scouted; Let fall a shower of tears—and pouted. “My Hero is both brave and true, Whom I love as I ought to do; And when his duty call'd him o'er The Ocean to Iberia's shore, I pledg'd my faith that ne'er shall fail, Till Death concludes the flatt'ring tale. —The doting Knight shall not prevail.”— Thus she exclaim'd, in language bold, When to her wond'ring Sire she told The offer of the Man of Gold. “Don't be a fool,” old Docket said, “Nor falsify your father's trade. Does not a stately mansion wait, To ope for you its willing gate, Where wealth invites, and at whose door, You'll see your daily coach-and-four? While all the pleasure gold can buy, A husband's fondness will supply. Will you from Fashion turn aside, And all the charms of titled pride, Those wants and that distress to prove, Which wait on poverty and love? For should the vap'ring Major live, Should he the chance of war survive, Half-pay is all he has to give. Besides, to ev'ry eye 'tis clear Sir Peter cannot live a year. Your settlements I shall prepare With a paternal Lawyer's care. I shall employ my cunning skill To shape the am'rous Dotard's will; And then I'll make a swinging bill: Which, from pure love to you he'll pay Without deduction or delay. Be to his fondling follies blind; Be to his humours very kind; And take the wealth he'll leave behind. You then will be, by Fortune's bounty, The richest widow in the county.—” Thus Docket's arguments assail'd His daughter's mind, and they prevail'd. Julia, at length, consents to wed, But still the Major's in her head. Hymen performs his formal part; But still the Major's in her heart. The wedding o'er, the days are spent In plenteous feasts and merriment: While many a minstrel doth unite In song and dance throughout the night. Sir Peter, us'd to live in quiet, Could not maintain this scene of riot: His health and spirits both were gone, E'er half the Honey Moon had flown. But, thus confin'd to gouty chair, She nurs'd him with assiduous care; Or tun'd her voice, or touch'd the lute, Or read, as did his fancy suit. Now, it was one fine afternoon, That quite alone, and dinner done, When, while Sir Peter plied the glass; Julia, to make the moments pass, Ask'd Fashion how she told her story In Ackermann's Repository. Where every month her whims display, With graceful art, the bright array That decks the Beauties of the day. —Thus, as she read, a creaking sound Call'd her to turn her head around; When Henry at the window stood, All pale, as if by grief subdued. She was surpris'd,—but did not start.— “You ever have possess'd my heart,—” She fondly said;—“there, take my hand, And mind, my friend, what I command. Speak not a word,—but give good heed To the short tale I now shall read. That Dotard there, will never hear, For drink has stopp'd his list'ning ear. Nought but the cup his eye can see, Which it now views with ecstacy. Again, I tell you, give good heed To what I am about to read. Attend, while on the Page I look, And hear the Wisdom of the Book.” “Fair Julia lov'd a Soldier brave, “Who was, or said he was, her slave: “But, by his country call'd afar, “To mingle in the toils of War, “He, by his well-tried honour swore, “That when the toils of War were o'er, “Were he preserv'd for joys so sweet, “He'd lay his laurels at her feet; “And from the world's gay scene remove, “To live with Julia and with Love: “That he should feel far greater pride “To dwell beneath some mountain's side, “Possess'd of her unrivall'd charms, “Than keep in awe a world in arms. “She heard his vows, and gave her heart; “Nor were her tears the tears of art: “When her eyes wept his fond adieu, “Her Words were warm, her Love was true. “—At length the nations war no more, “And Henry seeks his native shore. “But ah, how great was his despair, “What Fury did his bosom tear, “When first the strange account he heard “That his dear Julia had preferr'd “Another, impotent and old, “To her young Soldier, brave and bold; “That Age and Avarice had led “His Julia to the Marriage Bed. “—He sought her, and requir'd to know “What fatal change had work'd his woe. “What had he done?—What he should do. “He knew too well,—for he was true. “His loss he should not long survive, “He soon, alas, should cease to live. “O that in battle he had died!— “—That's not my wish, she quick replied: “But e'er you tell your heart to break, “I beg, my friend, you'll let me speak.— “—Think me not false, for I am true: “Nay, frown not,—yes, to Love and you. “Reason and Int'rest told me both, “To this old man to plight my troth. “I had but little,—you had less; “No brilliant view of happiness: “And though, within the lowest cot, “I would have shar'd your humble lot, “Yet, when the means I could possess “Which would our future Union bless, “I gave my hand, th'allotted price, “And made myself the sacrifice. “When I was to the Altar led, “Age and Decrepitude to wed, “The Old Man's wealth seduc'd me there, “Which gen'rous Hymen bid me share; “And all, within a month or two, “I hope, Brave Boy, to give to you. “Behold, and see the stroke of Fate “Suspended o'er my palsied mate: “For Death, who fills his goblet high, “Tells him to drink it, and to die. “—And now, my Henry dear, depart “With this assurance from my heart.— “—I married him, by Heaven, 'tis true, “With all his riches in my view, “To see him die—and marry you.—” The Hunter unkennelled. THE Sportsmen sat within the Hall, Waiting the Huntsman's jovial call, With active appetite they eat, The solid bounties of the treat; And while their various feats they boast, Some famous Nimrod is the toast. Jack Rover, who would never balk His never-failing love of talk, With many a foul expression swore, That but the very day before, When in full chace, the hounds in play, A cursed Funeral cross'd the way, And he, and his horse Frank, together Leap'd o'er the Hearse, nor touch'd a feather The party jeer'd,—again he swore, He'd tell it till his life was o'er; That he would boldly state the case, Though Death should stare him in the face: When, as attentive to his call, The Spectre stalk'd across the Hall. —One seiz'd the knife, another swore He ne'er saw such a sight before: Others popp'd off, full helter skelter, And, on the stair-case sought for shelter; While Jack, as quick as he was able, Sunk, slyly, underneath the table. The Phantom drew the drap'ry back, And, in a trice, unkennell'd Jack: When, after crying Tally-ho— He pois'd his dart and gave the blow: Then told his friends to shove Jack Rover Into the Hearse which he leap'd over.— The Good Man, Death, and the Doctor. THE Good Man dead, this Lesson gives:— It is another Angel lives. A Star has set for ever here, To glitter in a brighter sphere. Earth feels the loss when Virtue dies, To triumph in its native skies. The chamber where He breathes his last, Who, glancing o'er the time that's past, Feels no reproach, nor calls on Fate To add a moment to his date; But, led by smiling Hope, descends To that dark bourne where Sorrow ends; That sacred Chamber far outweighs The brightest scene which Life displays. The rich, the potent, and the brave Must reach, at length, the certain grave: Nor is, alas, the difference great, Between the monumental state, That decks the mouldering remains Of him who serves and him who reigns; No more, than that the human clod Rests 'neath a marble or a sod. Emblazon'd with a gilded show, The pomp or fallacy of Woe, The Rich Man fills the sculptur'd tomb; While, where the vernal violets bloom, And rear their heads on church-yard green, The poor man's obsequies are seen. Each duty done,—the world subdued, How bless'd the Death-bed of the Good.— Whether beneath the dome we lie, Or in the straw-roof'd cottage die; At that alarming, awful hour, No mortal envies wealth or power:— But he who, with experience sage, Has reach'd to life's maturer age, And seen and felt the various cares, Which man throughout his progress shares;— He, who has haply learn'd to know Vice as the certain source of Woe, And Virtue as our Heav'n below;— He who considers fleeting Time The passage to some happier clime; The stream that bears the virtuous o'er, To that eternal, promis'd shore, Where Pain and Sorrow are no more;— He views the bed from whence the just Is borne to mingle with the dust, As the fix'd verge, on which 'tis given To see the boundaries of Heaven. When the world's landscape fades away, And night beclouds the closing day; When to the heart the blood retreats, And the last pulse but faintly beats; When the soft, whisp'ring sigh is o'er, Which the calm'd breast repeats no more; Each duty done,—the world subdu'd,— How blest the Death-bed of the Good! Eugenio liv'd as man should live; He gave, as generous man should give. Whene'er he smil'd, his smile exprest Th'enliv'ning sunshine of the breast. Whene'er he wept, the willing tear Told Sorrow and Affliction near; And Sorrow never came in vain, When he could mitigate the pain. From his wise mind the counsel flow'd; His hand the needful aid bestow'd: And rich and poor, who liv'd around, A blessing in his virtues found. The wife his chaste affections knew, And round his plenteous table grew Like olive branches, green and fair, The hopes of his paternal care. Learning he sought with pleasing toil, And sometimes burn'd the midnight oil, In adding to his copious store Of modern and of ancient lore: But still he kept his manners free From the stiff airs of pedantry; Nor did his fancy ever stray To suit the fashion of the day: Nor did he slippant wit supply, Nor cloak his speech with ribaldry. His well-weigh'd words were ever fraught With morals sound, and manly thought; While each expression, mild and warm, Was fram'd to counsel, and to charm. He planted the Celestial Flower, Which grows with Life's encreasing hour, But never yet was known to blow Within this vale of tears and woe; It waits through endless years to bloom, Beyond the confines of the tomb; There forms the everlasting wreath;— The crown of Virtue after death. That crown, while health beam'd on his brow, And promis'd length of years below; That crown, which blessed spirits share, Eugenio was call'd to wear: For so it pleas'd the Almighty power Who measures out life's mortal hour, That, e'er his fortieth year was past, The best of men should breathe his last. He piously resign'd his breath In all the majesty of Death:— One thought to those he lov'd was given, Then gave his willing soul to Heav'n. For he, who well his time employs, Though snatch'd from life's meridian joys, Feels no reluctance, knows no dread, When Fate conducts him to the dead. —Fly, ye profane—if not, draw near, And what Religion dictates, hear. “Father! to whose all-seeing eye “Our thoughts and actious open lie, “Thou know'st, in this afflicting hour, “We bend before thy sacred power; “And, taught thy pleasure to obey, “Bless him who gives and takes away. “But while thy justice makes us grieve, “Allow thy mercy to relieve: “Comfort, we ask, the widow'd heart, “And, to the rising race impart, “The noble, and the fond desire “To share the virtues of their Sire. “O grant, that they through life may run “The virtuous course which he hath done; “And feel, like him, at life's last hour, “Thy beaming grace,—thy pard'ning power.” Thus, as the pious Churchman pray'd, The Doctor, in a whisper said, “My skill in vain it's power applies;— “'Tis Fate commands; the patient dies. “No call requires me now to stay: “I've something else to do than pray. “I feel my Fee;”—“Then hold it fast,” Said grinning Death,—“for 'tis your last.” The Doctor heard the dreadful sound; The Doctor felt the fatal wound, And hast'ning through the chamber door, Sunk down, all breathless on the floor, Ah, never more to rise again.— —Thus Doctors die like other men. Death and the Portrait. BY Love conducted Flavia came, (I must not tell her other name) To yield the charms which deck her face, Her Cherub smiles and Angel grace, To the accomplish'd Painter's art, Which to the canvas might impart The fair resemblance of a Maid, Whom Nature had so well array'd. Flavia was seated to receive The Likeness which that art could give, And while, obedient to his will, The pencil mark'd its rapid skill, Enamour'd Florio, who sat by, And trac'd the work with curious eye, By tender love and beauty fir'd, And as the faithful Muse inspir'd, In tuneful accents thus address'd The fond instructions of his breast.— “Painter, vain's thy utmost art “To draw the Idol of my heart: “Thy canvas never can receive “The varied charms her features give. “When, grave, she wears the awful grace “That's seen in regal Juno's face: “When on her cheeks the smiles appear, “'Tis Venus better self is there; “And when she looks with studious eye, “Another Pallas we descry. “Painter, thy pencil well may trace “A Juno's awful, heavenly grace; “Upon your easel may be seen, “Chaste Beauty's fair, imperial Queen: “E'en Wisdom's goddess may appear “In all her native splendor there: “But in my breast alone can be “The perfect image of the Three.” Thus did the Muse the art defy: The Pencil, eager to reply, Dash'd on the cloth, in colours warm, The semblance of the lovely form. And now her smiling cheeks disclose The lily mingled with the rose; And soon her beaming eyes dispense The soften'd rays of manly sense: Her graceful form, her auburn hair, All, all the magic power declare. Loose flows the robe upon the ground, And many a Cupid flutters round: The bending branches kindly spread Their verdant beauties o'er her head, And, far beyond, the hills arise Which seem to mingle with the skies. At length, with happiest art array'd, The canvas' spreading form display'd The beauties of the charming maid. The Artist then avow'd his pride, And thus th'enraptur'd Muse replied.— “Ah happy Canvas, that dost bear The features of my lovely Fair. Upon thy surface, mild and clear, I see the heavenly form appear, With all the glories of her face, Her winning smiles and gentle grace. —But where's the virtue of her mind, Which makes her of Angelic kind? Where is the softness of her heart. To pity prone and void of art? These cannot on thy bosom shine: They're only to be found in mine.” Thus did the Muse pursue her song; Nor did she do the Painter wrong. Whatever bounties partial Art By Genius aided, can impart, She knows are his, whose talents bear The marks of their united care. But frolic Nature will outdo The works of Art and Genius too: Her cunning patterns render vain The Painter's toil, the Sculptor's pain. All of the Fair, that Art could give, Does on the glossy canvas live; In touches warm and colours true, As Reynolds' pencil ever knew. Thus Florio sung, and Flavia heard The pleasing strain which Love preferr'd Nor did the Painter's hand refuse The aiding impulse of the Muse. The Sitting o'er, the pair remove To talk of Taste, and think of Love. And while, as objects strike, they praise The various works on which they gaze; A far, far different form appears, Bent with an heavy load of years: For a short time the Figure stood, The image of Decripitude;— Then took his seat:—when Art began To sketch the good, old Alderman, Whose Portrait was to grace the wall Of Cordwainers' or Goldsmiths' Hall. The Painter mark'd the face of Age, And dignified the Civic Sage, With all the force and all the truth, Which had pourtray'd the grace of youth. At length, some yawning fits transpir'd That mark'd the Alderman was tir'd. “If, my good Sir,” the Painter said, “You wish the work to be delay'd; “If, to retire it is your pleasure, “My pencil waits upon your leisure.”— “I'm in no hurry,” he replied, “But I slept ill last night: beside “To tell the truth, I cannot say “But I am out of sorts to-day; “I have a feel I cannot name; “A kind of chill throughout my frame, “That seems to pour on ev'ry part, “And threatens to approach my heart: “Now, if you could some cordial give “It might my languid state relieve.”— “That you shall have,” the Artist cried; And soon his pallet laid aside: Then hasten'd, with no common speed, To do the hospitable deed. Scarce had he made this kind retreat, When Death stepp'd in and took his seat: And soon he chang'd the whole design:— The lights which had been seen to shine, Were more than half-obscur'd in shade; And dismal tints the whole pervade: The forehead's moist with mortal dew; The sinking frame appears to view; The head reclines in calm repose; The lips grow pale, the eyelids close; The yielding hand can grasp no more, The crutch lies prostrate on the floor; And, with one stroke, throughout the piece, All animation's made to cease. —The Painter brings the promis'd aid, And views the change that has been made. He sees the Picture's alter'd state, And owns the master-hand of Fate. “But, why,” he cries, “should Artists grieve “When Models die,—if Pictures live?” The Genealogist. OF all the Passions that infest The mansion of the human breast, Which trouble with continual strife The nobler Charities of Life; That which stirs up the greatest pother, And claims to bear down ev'ry other, Is Pride, which seems to fill more room, More various titles to assume, Than any tenant we can find, Within the chambers of the mind. The Passion, doubtless, is the same, Or in the low or titled name; And may be trac'd up to the sense Of what is call'd Pre-eminence, Whether in those who men command, Or such as drive their Four-in-Hand; In busy Maid who plies the broom, Or Dame of Rank in Drawing Room. Pride may be found in him who creeps Up chimnies, and those chimnies sweeps; Or in his breast who day and night Climbs up Ambition's dizzy height. But 'tis not here the verse intends To mark the fair and noble ends Of Pride, too little understood, Which is a virtue in the good; That dignifies th'exalted state Of those who are both good and great: That, sanction'd by right Reason's law, Keeps the submissive crowd in awe:— No, 'tis the Pride which makes men mad, And is a vice among the bad; Or, bred in Fashion's motley school, Is a known folly in the fool, With vain and idle objects fraught,— That now awakes the moral thought. Thus, if we look around, 'tis seen That some are proud of being mean; Or, boasting of their various feats, Are even proud of being cheats:— Are not Attornies ever vain, Of cunning, tricking, and chicane? They're known to have a certain pride, In cheating all the world beside. Some vaunt their mighty power in drinking, As if 'twere praise to banish thinking. 'Tis said, that Cælia has the trick Of being vain of being sick; And that she feels superior grace In languid looks and pallid face;— That she would think herself a fright, And charge it as an act of spite, If Health should give the ruddy hue That decks the cheeks of Moll or Sue. If Shopkeeper or Artizan Wants to be thought a Gentleman, The Herald, first he humbly pays; And then, in order due, displays His arms upon a one-horse chaise. The new-made Noble in the Gout, About his titles makes a rout; Then bids the Carver ply his tool To aggrandize a footing stool With sculptur'd arms, that all may see The splendid show of Heraldry, Which, in his new-born honours great, He treads beneath his hobbling feet; While on his gilded crutch is set The all-ennobling Coronet. Others, who boast an ancient race, And to remotest ages trace Of ancestors a noble line, Who through successive ages shine; Whose proud and honourable name By Hist'ry is consign'd to Fame;— Yet, if by Fortune's fatal frown The ancient Fabric tumbles down: If by profuse or vitious taste The vast domains are brought to waste, Lament it as a dire disgrace To mix with an inferior race, Whose wealth would happily restore Their state to what it was before. Not so the old Lord Freeland, He Fond as he was of Ancestry, And ancient name, could not restrain Of wounded pride the daily pain, When debts unpaid assail'd his gate, And his domains refus'd the weight Of mortgages, whose loud demands Call'd for the sale of house and lands: While the axe menac'd all the wood Which round his noble mansion stood With stately, venerable grace, The boast and grandeur of the place. “Embarrass'd as I am,” said he, “I'll not a noble beggar be, “If means of honour can be found “To heal my fortune's wasting wound. “Ne'er have I England's rights betray'd; “No bribe my voice has ever paid, “Nor will I e'er my name degrade; “Nor shall its public fame be lost “Be Pension, or by servile Post.” In short, Lord Freeland had the wit To wed a very wealthy Cit; And, on his golden wedding-day, All his distresses pass'd away. The bonny, and the happy bride Adopts her lordly husband's pride; And is most willing to forget All but the charming Coronet; Nay, with remembrance is at war, Of all things East of Temple Bar; While he calls in the Herald's aid To hide the blot that has been made In the pure flow of ages three, The period of his pedigree. —'Tis all arrang'd in order due, The splendid Roll's expos'd to view: The Man of Arms a tip-toe stands, And the fair scene of Blood expands: A finer Lineage ne'er was drest, With Ensign, Quartering, and Crest; True in all forms—and to the letter; Sir Isaac never sold a better. The Peer, with much delight explains The blood that flow'd throughout his veins: My Lady too began to purr, That such fine blood belong'd to her. Thus as th'Escutcheons she survey'd, Cocking her glass, she gravely said: But, my dear Lord, are you quite sure, The Herald has left out the Brewer? For 'twould not this fine roll exalt, To have it smell of Hops and Malt. My Uncle's name I much revere, But do not wish to see it here.— —But not alarm'd, my Lady dear; His name your eye will never see, On any branch of our tree. Remember I Sir Isaac quote: —“Your Uncle never had a Coat.”— My Lady in a passion flew;— He lies, she cried, and so do you.— My good old Uncle dress'd as well (A truth his Taylor's bills can tell) As any Lord within the land, And could a little cash command: This I, his Heiress, do declare: You know it too, who're simp'ring there. The Herald, who may please to scoff, Would wear the cloaths which he cast off. He talk of dress—a scurvy fellow;— Except, when dress'd like Punchinello, He stalks, as proud as he can go, A shape in some state Puppet show, His cloaths would scarcely tempt a Jew The shabby bargain to pursue. Or if the parsimonious brute Appears at times in velvet suit, All know 'tis furnish'd from a Pall; His fee at some state Funeral. I'll drive the sentence down his throat; —That Uncle John ne'er had a Coat.— Cease, Lady dear, cease your alarms;— The Herald meant—a Coat of Arms.— —That's not so bad;—but I can state, That He had Arms upon his Plate.— —My Lady dear, I think 'twere best That we should let the matter rest: Our argument will not prevail; The plate was purchas'd at a Sale; And the good Knight, a little vain, Thought fit to let the Arms remain. 'Tis my advice,—your anger cease, And let the Herald live in peace. Our Honours will be more secure To sink the Bearings of the Brewer. Thus, while they talk the matter o'er, The splendid Roll sinks on the floor; And lo, a sight brimful of fears:— The Herald's gone, and Death appears. His Lordship starts, and shakes, and falls: My Lady stares, and screams, and squalls. “Make not,” said Death, “this mighty stir; “You're now a wealthy Dowager, “And may, perhaps, for many a year, “Live on, the Widow of a Peer. “But 'twere as well to lay aside “This embryo of human pride. “Whether from Priam you descend, “Or your Dad cried—Old chairs to mend; “When you are summon'd to your end, “You will not shun the fatal blow; “And sure, you're old enough to know, “That though each varying Pedigree “Begins with Time,—it ends with Me.” The Catchpole. LAW is, or should the offspring be Of Justice and Humanity, And prove as plain as A, B, C. Should go strait forward on its way, Nor e'er be subject to delay: No crosses should its steps prolong To what is right, or what is wrong. The Law is just,—the Law is good, While suffer'd to be understood; But, 'tis the Practice that confounds it, Winding its mystic Nonsense round it; And such fallacious arts possessing, It to a curse converts the blessing. Practice, the fruit of am'rous sport, In King's-Bench Walks, or Fig-Tree Court; What time Contention did constrain To his embrace the Fiend Chicane; When, drugg'd with Pleadings, Justice slept, While Reason saw the deed, and wept. Then issued forth the Parchment brood Of Writs, ill-fated brotherhood; Born to entangle and perplex, Their Cradle,—the Attorney's desk: Fi Fa's, Ca Sa's, and all the fry That fill the Catchpole's Diary: Then crabbed Special Pleading comes, With all its Clerks, and all its Bums. O Special Pleading!—what an Art T'enlarge the mind, and mend the heart! O Special Pleading!—what a Science To bid all Common Sense defiance, Which not an head can understand, Unless 'tis deck'd with wig and band. But He, perhaps, is worth the knowing, Who sets all these fine things a-going. Your foul Attorney is a wretch, That's far inferior to Jack Ketch. —When grave, lamenting Law has done Its justice on some wicked one; That Minister performs his part Or on the scaffold, or the cart: Life's the due forfeit of the deed: The Felons hang—the Traitors bleed: Convicted crimes their fate endure, And life and limb are more secure. —But, 'tis the Pettifogger's art, With practis'd craft, and flinty heart, With Fictions, Quirks, and tardy Pleas, To aid th'accumulating Fees. He lifts his head at others' ruin, Nor fears to profit by undoing: Of his whole Life the great intent Is to perplex and circumvent; He guides his keen, voracious sense, With all the zeal of impudence; And pledges it a just vocation To quicken by Procrastination. —With the vile Catch-pole at his heels, Think you the Pettifogger feels For aught, but how the Suit proceeds? Nay, he will mock the heart that bleeds. He idly jokes, or pertly prates O'er the distress he meditates; And cheers, with looks alert and gay, The blood-hound to his destin'd prey. Will he not smile when Knavery gains The pelf which Honesty disdains? Think you he frowns when Rascals thrive, And Virtue struggles hard to live? What's it to him though orphans mourn, Though husbands from their wives are torn, Though houseless children, turn'd abroad, Ask alms, or pilfer on the road, So that low-born Contention reigns; The Dæmon that rewards his pains. Such Caitiffs vile will risk their souls In cheating honest men and fools. Had I the pow'r, as I've the will, My patriot wishes to fulfil; Justice at length should fully meet 'em, And with the Laws of Turkey greet 'em: To such as these I'd give no quarter, But pound the Rascals in a mortar The Lawyers in Turkey, in certain cases of criminality, suffer death in this manner.. To cure these evils Redesdale came, An ever venerated name; Who, for his labours to improve The rights of Justice, and remove, With wise reform, the cruel power That prey'd on Freedom's rightful hour, And save Misfortune from the thralls Which dwell within the Prison walls, Deserves as well the sculptur'd stone As e'en the laurell'd Wellington. —The one, amid the Fields of War, Chain'd Fortune to his rapid car, And to blest Britain's cherish'd name, Adds a resplendent wreath of Fame:— —The other forms his well-wrought plan, To aid the civil rights of Man; And through his country to increase, The blessings of domestic Peace. But 'twill appear, in every view, As the Muse doth her tale pursue, Tho' much is done—there's much to do. Honest Tom Frolicsome was known At ev'ry Coffee-house in Town. No one more free from pride or art, Or e'er could boast a warmer heart: He never saw a luckless friend To whom he did not give or lend; Nor e'er was known to be unwilling To share his guinea or his shilling. —It so fell out that one fine day, He met Jack Shiftly in his way; Who told a melancholy tale, How Lawyers threat, and Duns assail. So Tom, to save him from the paw Of the fell Myrmidons of Law, Consented kindly to be bound In the vast sum of Twenty pound. Jack, with profound professions, said, “Within the month it shall be paid.” The month soon pass'd, and it occurr'd To honest Jack to keep his word; But, as his debts he could not pay, Why Jack took fright and ran away, And left his friend to be the debtor, With all the threats of Lawyer's letter. But Nathan Shark not only wrote, He paid a visit with the Note: For e'en a rap at any door, Would tell for Six and eight-pence more:— But friendly Tom, whene'er at home, Was ne'er denied, let who would come. —Good Mr. Shark, says Tom, d'ye see, This is a trifling sum to me: But it so happens that, just now, My Banker's book is rather low; And, as the Debt is not my own, A fact to you so clearly known; And as I'm sure, you won't deny My honour and ability, If till Monday next you wait, Th'indulgence will not be too great: At ten o'clock, you'll send or come;— I will engage to be at home, When your demand I'll truly pay, With thanks, for your four days' delay. Shark bow'd and smil'd; for here he saw There was a loop-hole for the Law. To wait would never make a bill, Nor help the Lawyer's purse to fill; So the next day, as Tom was walking. And with two charming Misses talking, Dick Catchpole did the party meet And, with a Writ, his Honour greet. —You are arrested now you know, And so with me you e'en must go, Whether it is your will, or no. This fellow was a perfect brute, A Sheriff's vilest substitute: His wishes base, his purpose dark, Just a fit instrument for Shark. His housebreaking, burglarious Sire, Did before Newgate wall expire; And his Dam kept a Little-Go: When, for a trifling trick or two, She, by due course of law was sent Safe to Port Jackson, to repent. Tom's ruddy cheeks lost all their blood; But when he found how matters stood,— Why then, said he, the debt I'll pay; And let me go, without delay. No, no, said Dick—that will not do; I know a better thing or two: I can't tell what the costs may be; And, till they're paid,—you'll rest with me. So no more words,—for you must come— —Then send to Shark.—He's not at home: He to a Ven'son feast is gone At Wandsworth, or at Wimbledon: Therefore, come on, and rest in peace, To-morrow you'll have your release. Thus, as he told his stern command, A griesly Spectre's fleshless hand His shoulder touch'd:—It chill'd his blood, And at the sight he trembling stood. —You long have ow'd, the Phantom said, What now must instantly be paid.— —O give me Time!—Thou Caitiff Dun, You know, full well, you gave him none. Your Life's the debt that I am suing; 'Tis the last process, Master Bruin.— —I'll put in Bail above;—No, no: Old Nick shall be your Bail below. The Insurance Office. Self-Interest by some is said, To be the universal trade Which men of ev'ry rank pursue; And if, what some folks say, be true, Of ev'ry kind of Woman too. For wealth the Sailor ploughs the main, The Merchant thinks of nought but gain;— We even see superior sense, And all the powers of eloquence, Nay, ev'ry impulse of the breast, Yield to the calls of Interest. But if nor base, nor sordid view Blends with the purpose we pursue, If sage Discretion's cautious art Corrects the errors of the heart; If Prudence o'er the plan presides, And for its ends the means provides, Which, pointed to some rightful use, Shall tranquil Happiness produce: 'Tis that Self-Int'rest—that Self-Love Which Truth and Virtue must approve; And gives perfection to the plan That ought to govern social Man. How easy then to draw the line Between the motives that combine, To guide the intellectual power Whose regulation rules the hour Which fills the short, uncertain span Allotted to the race of Man. 'Tis Good or Evil.—Passion's flame That lights to deeds of splendid name, Or the temp'rate warmth benign, Whose rays on humble Virtue shine, Alike, by different means, possess, The varied boon of Happiness. Beneath her roof domestic Care, The daily labour doth prepare. The Father, anxious to provide For the young Offspring by his side; The Mother, with her infant press'd, In doting fondness, to her breast; The bounteous Man whose open door Receives the wand'rer and the poor; The Hero, in his banner'd car, Smiling amid the scenes of war; The learned, philosophic Sage Who toils to teach a list'ning age, And Piety, that points the way To regions of eternal day; Each has an Int'rest to pursue, And keeps the fav'rite point in view,— The Interest, well understood, In each condition, to be Good; And that true Happiness to know Which Virtue only can bestow. But less exalted views, we trust, May still be honest, and be just; And Int'rests, less refin'd, may be Pursu'd with strict propriety. Wealth may be sought without a vice, For Prudence is not Avarice. The gen'rous, independent spirit, Which 'tis a blessing to inherit, In all its energies depends On the right use of means to ends. Nay, 'tis the use of these same tools Distinguishes Wise Men from Fools. —A reason soon will rise to view,— Why we may add Wise Women too. Tir'd of a stupid, single state, Ned Freeman took a charming mate. He was a man of some degree, Renown'd for hospitality: And all those virtues we admire In him who's dubb'd a Country 'Squire. Health beam'd upon his smiling face; His cheeks display'd a ruddy grace. His jolly form, and visage, bore The marks of thirty years, or more, And look'd as he might reach threescore. Such was the subject of their chat One ev'ning as this couple sat, And ponder'd o'er, like man and wife, The prospect of their future Life. She was a tender, faithful Spouse, Obedient to her marriage vows; Nor, like some wives, was fond to boast, That, she at home, could rule the roast. But Mrs. Freeman ne'er would balk Her fancy, when she chose to talk. And then dear Ned, but not through fear, Would hold his tongue, and lend his ear. This evening she had much to say, And told it in her usual way. —I know, my Dear, you love me well, As I am very proud to tell; And to confess, I am most willing, You married me without a shilling: But what disgrace 'twould be, you know, Were you to die and leave me so: Nature, in all her freaks and fun, Has never given us a Son; And there's no jointure, Sir, for me Without that same Contingency. For your Estate's so bound and tied, So settled and transmogrified, (A thing one scarcely can believe) You've not a thousand pounds to leave. —To you, my Love, I trust in Heav'n, The promise of long life is given, And were I sure 'twas Heaven's intent To take me first, I'd be content: But you, I fear, my dearest Life Are ten years older than your wife. Besides, your spirit in the Field:— To you the boldest Hunters yield; And should He not his ardor check, My Ned, perhaps, may break his neck; And then, in that impoverish'd state, Say, what would be your widow's fate?— I know it well,—I act no part:— Your Widow then would break her heart. Is't not enough that, o'er the grave Of him I lov'd my grief must rave; But I, to aggravate my cares, Must be dependent on his Heirs! They hate me now,—illiberal men! Nor can I think they'd love me then. 'Squire Freeman's Relict must not live On any thing they chuse to give. —The tears now flow'd, and honest Ned Pinch'd her plump cheek, and kindly said, Weep not yet, Girl, I am not dead: And, if we live another day, The Mail shall bear us on our way, With rapid haste, to London town, Where all you wish for shall be done. To prove how much I love my wife, By Jingo, I'll insure my Life; And if kind Fate is pleas'd to give Ned Freeman but ten days to live;— Then, if he dies;—why, I'll be bound You shall be worth ten thousand pound. At length arriv'd,—with spirits light From the refreshments of the night, The parties leave the Two-neck'd Swan, Or for the Globe, or Pelican, When they explain, with all due care, The object of their errand there. The Doctor's call'd—his eye to throw On the good 'Squire from top to toe. The sage Director stands beside In dictatorial pomp and pride, Th'important Scrutiny to guide. —Doctor,—you'll now be pleas'd to scan The features of that Gentleman; And tell us, whether that round paunch Has been nurs'd by up ham and haunch: Say, if that vast protuberance Comes from ill habits, or from chance. Think you that crimson glow is health, Or form'd by drink, or made by stealth. Those legs, which now appear so stout, Have they been tickled by the Gout.— —And, Doctor, for your private ear, Does not this Country 'Squire appear Older, at least, by half a year Than what he has been pleas'd to state? —May we trust the Certificate?— To this the Doctor sage agreed:— The Office then was duly feed; And sign'd and seal'd each formal deed. Now Death, who sometimes loves to wait At an Insurance Office gate, To baffle the Accountant's skill And mock the calculating quill, Had just prepar'd his cunning dart To pierce Ned Freeman's tranquil heart:— But lest the stroke should cause dispute, And Lawyers conjure up a Suit, Death was determined to delay Ned's exit to a future day; And the dull moment to amuse, He turn'd—and kill'd a pair of Jews. Thus was the Husband's life insur'd, And the Wife's future wealth secur'd. Then to their Inn they went to dine; And while the 'Squire enjoy'd his wine, Madam, thus thought she might impart The secret wishes of her heart. —Now, my dear Ned, as we're in Town, And all this happy bus'ness done, We may as well a fortnight stay; Go to Vauxhall—and see a Play; With every sight which now occurs: The Grand Illustrious Visitors, Princes, and Cossacs, and Lord Mayors, And flaming Fire-works, and Fairs; With all the noble, splendid train, Which London may ne'er see again. It will, no doubt, respect command To've had an Emperor by the hand. How great the boast, 'mong country folk, To say we've seen old Blucher smoke. How, at my head they'll stare, when on it They see an Oldenburghian Bonnet. —Hunting, you know, has long been done, And Harvest is not yet begun: Let us the interval employ These recreations to enjoy. 'Squire Freeman, with his heart at ease, Happy and proud his wife to please, To grant her ev'ry wish consented, And smil'd to see her so contented. But Death had not forgot his Fiat— So bid a Fever set him quiet; And e'er, alas, ten days were past, Honest Ned Freeman breath'd his last. The Doctor call'd, to certify His glowing health, now saw him die. Thus she, who lately came to Town, With not a doit that was her own, Weeping attends her Husband's hearse, With many a thousand in her purse; And proves that she's of Wives the best, Who knows her Real Interest. The Schoolmaster. HERMIPPUS, as the Story's told, A Schoolmaster, in times of old, Is said to have drawn out his days As long, as Horace Walpole says, The Countess Desmond's Annals ran— To twice the common Age of Man And that his Life did thus extend Beyond what Nature might intend, By the balsamic Breath of those Who did his youthful School compose. And while their Lips new health exhales, He drove in Learning at their Tails. Whether Ma'am Desmond did employ The Respirations of a Boy, Or blooming Girls, who breath'd perfume To purify her dressing-room, We neither know, nor shall we strive Into those hidden powers to dive That kept the Dame so long alive. Nor shall we yet attempt to seek 'em In the old Age of Doctor Greekum. For years he now had reach'd fourscore, And yet he was for adding more; Nay, envied ev'ry rosy boy Who did his learned care employ, Whene'er his Fancy might conceive How long the Child would have to live. But then the Rev'rend Pedant said, It was not that he felt afraid Of Death, or of his future fate, In that unknown and awful state, Which 'twas Religion to believe Would wait on those who cease to live; But that he might secure his fame, Might eternise a learned name; As one more Lustrum In Classic Authors, it appears, A Lustrum occupies five years. would produce A work of such acknowledg'd use— So full of deep, recondite knowledge, That ev'ry School and ev'ry College Would, both in Greek and Latin lays, His Genius and his Learning praise. That finish'd, he would go to bed With joy, among the Honour'd Dead. Such were the Doctrines of the Sage, Whene'er he talk'd about his age;— And such, at lengh, he had to plead, Where mortal reas'nings ne'er succeed: For, as he held the Sov'reign sway Whose rod submissive Boys obey, And look'd around him from his throne, Whose pow'r no subject dare disown, He, nor without emotion, saw A Shape who did that pow'r o'erawe, Who bade him from his seat descend, And on his Visitor attend. I know you well, the Doctor said, And that your will must be obey'd. The circling hours that in their flight Consume the day and waste the night: The circling hours and varying year, Convince us all is mortal here Imortalia ne speres, monet annus &amp; almum Quæ rapit Hora diem. Frigora Mitescunt Zephyris, &amp;c. —Hor. Lib. iv. Od. 6.. In Spring the Winter melts away, The Spring is lost in Summer ray; Then Summer dies in Autumn's reign, And slow-pac'd Winter comes again: Again the balmy Spring returns; And the fierce sultry Summer burns: The Autumn fruits again abound, And Time thus makes its yearly round: The Moon renews her silver light— But when we seek the depths of night, Where all the rich, the brave are laid, We're only ashes and a shade. —I know you well, and understand To what you point your fleshless hand: I see you mark my final hour, And bend me to that awful power Which tells me I must soon be laid In the dark Tomb's eternal shade. That I may wish to live, is true, But not that I'm afraid of you; My only care's to leave behind A stock of Learning for mankind; Which, had I some few years to live It would be Greekum's pride to give: But, though it is your will, I see, To rob the world of that and me; You might have come without intrusion, Nor caus'd this bustle and confusion. No warning given:—'Tis quite shocking That you should enter without knocking, In spite of the Horatian rule That's taught in ev'ry Classic School. Mors Pulsat, which, if I am pat in, The purport of the Poet's Latin; And which, believe me, I who quote it, Know full as well as him who wrote it, Means that you should some notice give, E'er that you bid us cease to live; That you should knock, at least, and wait, Till some one opes th'unwilling gate Pallida mors æquo pulsat pedte pauperum tabernas, Regumque turres, &amp;c. —Hor. Lib. i. Od. 4. — Pale-fac'd Fate Knocks at the Palace as the Cottage gate.. Doctor, this Dart will neither speak In Hebrew, Latin, or in Greek; But has a certain Language known In ev'ry age as in our own; Which ev'ry clime will comprehend Until the world itself shall end. —Now, Horace had no other warning Than you receive this very morning; When eighteen hundred years ago, Of this same dart he felt the blow. Besides, to him by Fate 'twas given, To quit this Life at Fifty-seven; And you, sage Sir, have reach'd Four-score, E'er that your mortal Journey's o'er. I ne'er but once my visit pay;— My errand ne'er allows delay: But Time, you know, with his bald pate, Has long been knocking at your gate. —But you'll at least these Urchins spare, They are my last—my only care.— —I'll hurt them not,—I'll only scare 'em: So die,—and Mors est Finis rerum. Which, for your Scholars, I'll translate— Death strikes the Learn'd,—the Little, and the Great. The Coquette. DEATH is a very Proteus—He, (Where shall we find a simile To give a clear and proper notion Of the Scare-crow's perpetual motion?) Sometimes, amid the fields of war Grimly rolls on his iron car; Where, as he guides its rapid wheel, Thousands his bloody jav'lin feel: Then spreads his pinions to dispense The mortal breath of Pestilence; And where his distant flight is sped, He gluts on regions of the dead. Then he the pois'nous sickle wields, That desolates the fruitful fields, Where meagre millions look aghast, And Famine aids the mortal blast. —Upon the foamy wave he rides, And the resistless whirlwind guides: So fierce the angry torrents pour, So loud the furious billows roar, That the brave Seaman's cheek grows pale: Fearless no more, he quits the sail, And the proud Vessel, that defies The strength of mortal enemies, Yields her to the all-powerful blow, And sinks into the gulph below. —In the deep caverns of the Earth, He gives those dire commotions birth; Which, by their elemental power, Shake down the Temple and the Tower, Whose lofty tops approach the skies; While Man beneath the ruins dies. —From hence we turn.—To these vast deeds The common Episode succeeds: And now we view his hourly plan Against the general Life of Man. Here he assumes the Fever's heat; The blood flows quick, the pulses beat; There, in the trembling Ague quakes, When ev'ry chilly member shakes; Or in an Asthma heaves the breast, That night and day refuses rest: Or racking gout wrapt up in fur, That suffers not a limb to stir: And thus his various power employs, And thus the race of Man destroys. —But, 'tis not merely by Disease He doth his hourly victims seize; He claims the Passions that impart Their impulse to the Human heart: They barb his dart with hopeless care Or the sharp fury of Despair, Or plant the ling'ring Sorrow there:— Ambition's sleepless lust of power, And Disappointment's madd'ning hour; Or, in the form of raging Pride, He views the gasping Suicide. In the world's cares he plays his part, And, with a Law-suit, breaks a heart; Or makes e'en Pleasure, light and gay, A trap to catch th'incautious prey. Thus Flavia, in her early bloom, Was summon'd to the silent tomb. Beauty was her's, and ev'ry charm That can the youthful bosom warm: She was the very soul of Pleasure, And Fashion's dear and darling treasure. She waited but the hour to fix A title, and a coach and six: For that she studied ev'ry grace Which aids the shape or decks the face, For that arrang'd her auburn hair In ringlets here, in tresses there; How in the dance she best could move, To fan desire, and waken Love. These all her serious thoughts employ: Nor does she guess at any joy, But what she thinks is to be found In the gay world's enchanting round: She never sought Reflection's aid, In Reason's ballance never weigh'd Or good or ill; the law alone That govern'd Flavia was—the Ton. Her sister died; the tears she shed, Did not lament Corinna dead:— They flow'd that, for a month to come, She was forbid to stir from home; And that for six, her form divine, Black crape and sars'net, should enshrine: For she ne'er heard that Beauty's queen Had e'er appear'd in bombazine. She little thought the sable dress That did upon her spirits press, That did the keen vexation stir, Would soon, alas, be worn for her. That she who could the town enslave, Would soon be sleeping in the grave. It was past twelve—but not yet one When sober folks to bed were gone, That Flavia, at her Toilette's duty, Receiv'd the aid that's claim'd by Beauty; Expecting Lady Jane to call To go to Lady Mary's Ball: But, as her lovely form receiv'd The robe which Fashion's hand had weav'd, A shape appear'd, of such a mien As Flavia's eyes had never seen:— How dare you enter here, she said, And what's this saucy Masquerade? Who are you?—Betty, ring the bell. The Shape reply'd—'Twill be your knell I'll save you from the swelt'ring crowd Form'd by the vain, the gay, the proud, For which your tawdry mind prepares Its fruitless, its coquettish airs. Lady, you now must quit your home, For the cool grotto of a tomb. Be not dismay'd; my gallant dart Will ease the flutt'rings of your heart. He grinn'd a smile—the jav'lin flies— When Betty screams—and Flavia dies. Time &amp; Death, and Goody Barton. A CAUSETTE. Death. WHENCE come you, and where are you going? Time. My old Friend Death!—why, I've been mowing: And here have got a pretty crop Within my common, trundling Shop. Nay, I am hastning now to sow: Though, at the Harvest, as you know, We never shall be call'd to mow. For when that's ripe, my ancient Friend, We shall shake hands, and find an end. In the mean time, I'll play my part, And try to fill my daily cart: For full or empty I proceed, Or with the living or the dead. I trudge on, my old steady pace, But yet I always win the race; And though I'm sober in my gait, You know, I never stop to bait. Let whip, or spur, the courser goad, I shall o'ertake him on the road: For though he paces like the wind, At last, he will be left behind: Wind-gall'd, or spavin'd, or broke-down, He will my better bottom own: And you'll take care, with all your heart, To find me Luggage for my Cart. Aye—partners in one common toil, We still shall share the mortal spoil. —But what's your present burden, pray? The man's dispos'd to disobey; And while he shows that living face, With me he cannot have a place.— Death. 'Tis true, the Fellow makes a riot: There's one jerk more—and now he's quiet. —But, Goody Barton, what's this pother? Goody Barton. Pray stop the Cart, and take another. For since your Worship's been so good To snatch old Simon of the Wood, The plague of all the neighbourhood, Take this old Man; for, to be free, He long has been a plague to me. He married me at past threescore, When I was blooming twenty-four: And, as I've testimony here, He swore he should not live a year; But now, as true as God's in Heaven, The lying rogue has liv'd eleven: While this brave Soldier, on his sword Has sworn, that he will keep his word. And he, bedeck'd with martial grace, Has promis'd to supply his place. —Now, take an injur'd woman's part, And shove him into yonder Cart. —I hope my freedom you'll excuse,— But I shall weep, if you refuse. Death. My Goody, 'tis too late to-day Time's moving on, and will not stay; But be at rest, and save your sorrow;— The Cart will come again, to-morrow. The Undertaker &amp; the Quack. I wish I were among the wise, Who can the mind anatomise: Trace to its source, with certain art, Each impulse of the human heart: Of ev'ry action find the cause, By certain and unerring Laws; And thus be qualified to state, Among the Little and the Great, What are the motives that precede Each private, or each public deed; Or for what just or selfish end Man plays the foe, or acts the friend. This, I must own, I don't possess; And, therefore, I could never guess The reason why I see John Bull, This day a Wit, the next a Cull; At times a Sage—and then a Fool. Examples, I'm afraid, are plenty; But, I must pick out one from twenty. It has been said, that Man's best wealth, And truly said, consists in Health; Yet, what a Spendthrift of the blessing, As if it were not worth possessing; And then the folly is as plain, In means to get it back again. From hence there springs the Quacking race, Of Medicine the foul disgrace; And such the folly which prevails, Though angry Reason frowns and rails, That oft th'Empiric cuts and carves, While Science, in a garret starves. What the Disease, or where the wound, For which a cure may not be found? If you believe the boasted scrawl That's pasted on each public wall. The Undertaker, passing by, Views it with no unwilling eye, Nor doth the idle vaunt upbraid, Which promises increase of trade; And all the Med'cine Shops he sees, He thinks are Banks, for Sexton's fees: A personage to Church-yards known, Whose welfare's blended with his own. In some old Town—no matter, where, Screwtight had long possess'd the care Of building houses for the dead, Either of elm, or oak or lead, According to the various state Of those who felt the stroke of Fate; And, during thirty years, that He Had dealt in Man's mortality, He had consign'd to Holy Ground, Half of his country neighbours round. A jovial Fellow too, was Ned: He'd drink your health, and wish you dead; But, that was in the way of trade, Whose interests he duly weigh'd. He o'er the dead ne'er shed a tear But once, as you shall quickly hear.— A Doctor, who the art had found, Sometimes, to make a sick man sound; And also had a cunning trick, As often, to make sound men sick; While his Specific, Sov'reign Pill, To cure all ails—would sometimes kill; As he was one day riding home, Death fancied to be frolicsome: And leaping on the Doctor's hack, Sat close and snugly, at his back; And, as they reach'd Ned Screwtight's door, Death sneez'd—and Nostrum was no more. Ned bellow'd, as he view'd the sight, Which put the street into a fright, This day I never wish'd to see— Unlucky for my trade, and me.— —His wife exclaim'd—what's all this rout?— Here, bring him in, and lay him out. What's got into your foolish Nob? The man is dead—and you've a Job.— Screwtight hung down his head and sigh'd. —You foolish woman, he replied,— Old Nostrum, there, stretch'd on the ground, Was the best friend I ever found. The good man lies upon his back; And trade, will now, be very slack. —How shall we Undertakers thrive With Doctors who keep folks alive? You talk of jobs.—I swear 'tis true,— I'd sooner do the job for you. We've cause to grieve—say what you will;— For, when Quacks die,—they cease to kill. The Masquerade. “LIFE is a Farce, and all things show it.” Thus far John Gay,—a pretty Poet. While others, I believe, have said, “That Life is but a Masquerade.” Some nervous people may conceive it: But hang me, then, if I believe it. These simple questions I would ask, If Honesty e'er wears a mask? If Piety takes borrow'd airs, And in a Visor says its prayers? When Charity serenely smiles, Is it a Virtue that beguiles? When Public Men support the cause Of Justice and their Country's Laws, Can I suppose that they are brewing Some Mischief for that Country's ruin? Or when the Soldier guards the throne As if its power were his own; Should I consult or Truth or Reason, To fancy there is lurking Treason? Suspicion, or Lord Bacon lies, From Ignorance doth take its rise; And vain would be the various knowledge Which I have gain'd at School and College, If I should have that wretched failing Which ends in Calumny and Railing. 'Twas thus I mus'd, at close of day, As I upon the sofa lay: When Morpheus o'er my senses crept, And all my yielding nature slept. The subject of my waking hour Was carried on by Fancy's power; And my fine Philosophic theme Was now transform'd into a Dream. I thought, I somehow, was convey'd To join a splendid Masquerade; And that my youthful form was drest In some such mantle, robe or vest, As when Philosophy was gay, Might have bedeck'd old Seneca. —Some rang'd aloft—and some below Compos'd the motley, crowded show. The lights, in parti-colour'd blaze, Darted around their dazzling rays. Here ev'ry aromatic flower Sweeten'd the gay inviting bower; And there the festive board appear'd, While animating Music cheer'd. With all its bustle, singing, flirting, The scene to me was not diverting; And calling Reason to my aid. I thought, I rather loudly said, Life cannot be a Masquerade. Thus, as I spoke, a Rev'rend Sage, As he appear'd, bent down with Age, In a commanding, solemn tone, Made his superior Knowledge known. Though you assume, with so much care, A grave and Philosophic air; It is your inexperienc'd youth That glosses o'er the real truth: This is the place where you may scan The portraiture of social man: Nor will your time be pass'd in vain, If you attend, while I explain. —See Falstaff's form;—pray look at him, So full of ribaldry and whim: And yet that paunch shields from the sight, A lean, pale, fawning Hypocrite; Who feeds upon the daily care Of preaching penitence and prayer: Nay, to his groaning Saints will tell, A Masquerade's the way to Hell. —What think you of that blooming fair Who wears the crescent in her hair, The semblance of a Virgin chaste, With Dian's zone around her waist: But little do these emblems suit:— She's an abandon'd Prostitute —There's a Peruvian Chief, so fine— He seems the Master of a Mine, Whose envied Treas'ry would unfold Ingots of silver and of gold. There's Momus too, that foe to sorrow: —They'll meet in the Gazette to-morrow. —Regard that Beggar, on her crutches: She is a young and lively Duchess. Present her alms, and she'll receive 'em; Though she has not yet learn'd to give 'em. —That stout, and well-made Pugilist, Who stalks about with well-clench'd fist; And challenges to left and right, Inviting all to come and fight; With this same very noisy fellow, A squeaking, hunch-back, Punchinello. Though their foul clamours never cease;— At home they're paid to keep the peace. For so, 'tis order'd by the Fates, They are two Police Magistrates. —Behold Apollo, with his Lyre, And hear him breathe Poetic Fire: But not a couplet is his own.— He is, in truth, the dullest drone, That palms his nonsense on the town. —See that gay Nymph, with what a bound She nimbly rises from the ground: Alas, those cheeks, where Health appears In gay disguise, are us'd to tears. What though her arms, with am'rous rant, Give their embrace to each gallant; Next week she bids adieu to men, And goes into the Magdalen. —There's Justice, who expounds the Laws, And talks about the poor man's cause: Displays the scales, and shows the sword; But you'll not take the rascal's word. A Lawyer he, you may rely on't; Who never fails to squeeze a Client.— —Those Lords set out in Liv'ry gay Of red, and white, and blue, and grey; With tassel'd hats, and shoulders proud, On which the epaulette's bestow'd; Who, thus array'd in Footman's dress, Would every Dame of rank caress; As they salute the passing fair, But shew us what their Fathers were. —You may suppose, deck'd out in pladdie, He is some bonny Highland Laddie, Who his bold, war-like clan can trace Full as far back as Ossian's race, Whose broad sword would attack a cannon; No,—he's an offspring of the Shannon. —That busy rogue, with rosy mien, His night-cap white, and apron clean, Who sharps his knife, has just forsook His banking shop, to be a cook. But, in his kitchen-dress, I scan The figure of an Alderman. Oh 'tis a gormandizing sinner, Who's life's chief object is a dinner. —There's the Eighth Henry, all in state, So fat, so haughty, and so great, Who grunts command, and cries out—Ha! He's a spare member of the Law, Who, having not the power to kill A wife he's tir'd of, at his will, Is glad at home to read a brief That bids him strive to hang a thief. The artful baggage who is pulling His tinsel'd sleeve, is Anna Bullen:— By her the Tyrant is not dreaded, Nor does she fear to be beheaded. She is a Lady at command, Who oft has strok'd a Lawyer's band. —Look at the nymph, so light, so slim, Array'd in all the flow'ry trim, In the half-transparent dress Of some Arcadian Shepherdess:— With what an air, her crook she waves, As if to awe her Shepherd slaves, But not as if she wish'd to keep In Arcady, a flock of sheep. Then view the Turk, who now pursues her, And with such am'rous motions woos her, Not words alone his passion prove:— A proffer'd purse proclaims his Love. Charm'd with her shape, and winning grace, What would he give, to see her face! In keen Resentment's ready pride She turns the painted Mask aside, And shews that face;—away he flies, As if some Dæmon in disguise, Had aim'd a dagger at his life: 'Twas no such thing, unless a wife, From such an husband to escape, Can shew at will some horrid shape. 'Tis but two years, since they were wed, When Love its crimson roses shed Around their couch; and deathless vows Were breath'd by each enamour'd spouse, But so it was, that, e'er the Sun Had his allotted circuit run, She to the Laws address'd her suit, To save her from the horrid Brute. The Laws were kind to her entreating, And she no longer fears a beating; But, as you see, at large can prance, Clad in a separate maintenance. —That figure there, with look profound, His eye commercing with the ground, Whose beard so long, so white with age, Is the fit Costume of the sage: Would, as it seems, appear to be The essence of Philosophy. But He's no Clerk,—though, arragh burn ye, Pat was brought up as an Attorney; And now his Fame and Purse encreases, By writing Rhymes instead of Leases; Of other Authors makes a hash, And thus works up the flimsy trash, That each revolving month is seen To flourish in a Magazine. He meditates how he shall write On all he hears, and sees to-night; That in some Journal, he may say, How this Diversion past away: And be assured, the pond'ring elf Will not omit his pompous self. —Regard that sighing love-sick swain, Who, in the cloak and plume of Spain, To ev'ry damsel doth complain, And, to the lute's respondent strings, Some tender, am'rous ditty sings: The youth has stole a march from College, Without his surly Father's knowledge; Who, while he sings his am'rous strain, Is fast asleep in Philpot Lane. His pride is to be thought a Poet, And here the Student comes to shew it. Again he sings, 'twere well to hear him; And, if his verse is good, we'll cheer him. Recitative. As I wander through the grove, Thus I sing in praise of Love. Ye powers of Harmony inspire, And aid me as I strike the Lyre. All my heart's secret pulses move, While thus I hail thee—Heavenly Love. SONG. Thee feels the rough Norwegian in his cot, Thick ribb'd with ice and pil'd with snow; The fine-nerv'd Persian, stretch'd in sultry grot, Feels thee a fiercer sun within him glow: And wild with Love, and flaming with desire, Feeds, self-tormented, feeds, the soft Idalian fire. To thee the pale-ey'd cloister'd fair With fond devotion fills her eyes: 'Tis not to Heav'n she wafts her sighs, To thy embower'd altar flies the prayer. For thee, the azure-ey'd Circassian pines, What time in all her youthful grace, And Beauty's bloom, unto the loath'd embrace Of some proud Sultan, she her charms resigns; For thee, her cause and end, celestial Love she pines. 'Tis not the heat of rash desire, Midst banquets born and floods of madd'ning wine, When Love's soft passion first appears divine, Nor what the Harlot's glances can inspire; Nor ought perfum'd that breathes the high-born dame, Whose painted cheeks, Fashion's fond fools admire: Love's more sublime, a far more sacred fire. Recitative. Begot by Beauty on the eyes, From the heart produc'd in sighs; On smiles it feeds, on smiles the pride Of reason, to the brute deny'd. —As I wander through the grove, Thus I sing in praise of Love!— Well done, my Bard,—your verse is true: You sung it well,—and wrote it true. —Such is the scene,—and, trust to me, Of Life such is th'Epitome: Whether your years are few or many, You'll find this is Life's miscellany. Yes, you'll remember who display'd The moral of the Masquerade. —I'm like the rest,—my game I play, I wear a mask as well as they: And not a moment I'll defer To show my real character. —'Twas Death himself, and by my side, He rose in grim and griesly pride. The music ceas'd—the lights burn'd blue, And all was horrid to my view. He pois'd his dart, and danc'd along, With rattling step, amid the throng. Some scream'd their fears, and others fled, While the Shape pac'd it o'er the dead. At length, methought, I felt his stroke;— And glad I was, when I awoke. —Though I'm grown old, I've not forgot The lesson which the Vision taught; And own, though with a sigh or two, Too oft I found—The Vision true. The Death Blow. TO what does Britain owe her Fame, Her honour, and superior name, With all the splendour of her Glory, In ancient, and in modern story? Where'er her Colours are unfurl'd, Where'er her war-like Thunder's hurl'd, Or on the Land, or on the Sea, She is the Child of Victory. —Is it to Commerce that she owes The name which all the world bestows? Wealth may afford its pow'rful aid, But Glory is not gain'd by Trade. Cowards, 'tis true, are sometimes bold; To shield from Force the treasur'd gold; Nay, half-starv'd Av'rice will be brave From pilf'ring hands his bags to save: But this strange passion of the hour, Derives from Fear its transient power. Say, is it Freedom that inspires The bosom with its early fires? That is a motive to incite The embattl'd Phalanx to the fight: But Boys are brave, while in their teens, Before they know what Freedom means:— No, though the cause I cannot scan, 'Tis Nature forms an Englishman. 'Tis Nature's powers that impart Its courage to the British heart: 'Tis the Home Combats that prepare The Hero for the feats of War. It is the triumphs of the Fist, The contests of the Pugilist, 'Tis these that discipline the Will To future darings, and instill The Spirit that ne'er knows to yield In contests of the tented Field; And teach the Seaman to sustain The bloody conflict of the Main. How oft we see John Bull delight. To court the fierce, domestic fight, Where no base, angry passions lead To murd'rous act, or vengeful deed: Where Honour is the darling Meed: Tho', sometimes, to reward the bold, The Conq'eror shares the wager'd gold. From Art, no cov'ring he receives, His arms are those which Nature gives: In native strength, he scorns to wield The Spear, the Broadsword, or the Shield. No helmet glitters on his brow, His brawny breast is bare below. The well-cropt hair his temples crown, Or brown, or fair, and all his own. The blows proceed from well-clench'd fist, The strong-nerv'd arms those blows resist; And though by some judicious knock, An eye is clos'd—a jaw is broke: Or by some well-directed blows, The blood comes gushing from the nose; And tho' the ribs may change their hue, On being beaten black and blue; Or lifted up, 'twixt earth and Heaven, A fierce cross-buttock may be given To him who, whatsoe'er his science, When strength commands, must yield compliance: But, when the Battle's lost and won, And all th'enliv'ning Hubbub's done, Peace soon resumes her former reign, And all is harmony again. What, tho' the vanquish'd Hero's led Hobbling away to seek his bed, And e'en the Conqueror, opprest With weighty blows, has need of rest; Yet here the short-liv'd fury ends, And the fierce foes are instant friends. One of our modern Statesmen thought, A man, with various wisdom fraught, That this same pugilistic art Did courage to the mind impart; And that each battle which is seen, 'Mong country folks upon the Green, Where tender smiles might be the prize Of him who clos'd a rival's eyes, Would urge the Youth to seek the fame Which waits upon a Soldier's name. —I am delighted to agree With this great Man's philosophy; Which, to confirm, I've got a story, That tells of Death, as well as Glory. Harry from Sheffield, Tom from Town, Experienc'd Boxers of renown. Had met to fight near Epsom Down. Who the keen Bottle-holders were, Or who the Champions did prepare, Were names too crabbed to rehearse In the soft melody of Verse; And they who kept the well-fenc'd ring The Muses do not chuse to sing. Thither the Amateurs repair, The noble Fanciers all were there— And thousands from the country round, Were seen on the enchanted ground. Smart Gigs and Curricles appear, While slow-pac'd Carts bring up the rear. That glorious day, 'twas who could get A Horse, or Chaise:—they all were let. In London, many a sooty Son Of Labour, left his work undone; And trudg'd through heat, and dust to see The Pugilistic Chivalry. And all the Kiddies were awake, The Bets to offer, or to take. The Combatants at length appear'd— A thousand tongues their presence cheer'd. They stripp'd, and to the eager eye, Display'd their strength and symmetry. Harry, Herculean shape possess'd, While Tom's superior form was dress'd In those proportions that might grace A Figure of Celestial Race; Such as the Bards of ancient days Have sung in their immortal Lays, And to the Sculptor might impart The antique beauties of his Art. Both stood erect, in manly tread, An Ajax and a Diomede. At length, th'impatient Fight began: 'Twas hand to hand and man to man. Some lively sparring first took place, And then a blow on either face. Again for mastery they try, And then a hit on either eye. Each Hero for advantage watches: Tom aim'd a blow which t'other catches; Then, as they both th'occasion seek Strongly to strike, Tom's ruddy cheek Receiv'd a Hit beneath the eye, That made the crimson fluid fly; And the conclusion of the round Is Tom from London on the ground. A Facer is the term that's us'd, Nor would the Slang have been refus'd But that the Muse, though fond of chime, Capriciously denied a rhyme. In various way the Betting ran, But Harry was the favourite man. Now Tom broke through his rival's guard, And of this movement the reward Was, with the quickness of a bullet, To force a hit on Harry's gullet. His ev'ry effort seem'd to tell; And the round clos'd when Harry fell. Five minutes now had pass'd away, In sparring, and such cautious play, When Harry, all his strength address'd To place a blow on Tommy's breast. The stroke resounded like a drum: It seem'd as if Tom's end was come; But no—for he contriv'd to place An active Hit on Harry's face. And of this round, no more's to tell— Than that they clos'd, and that they fell. Now Harry seiz'd his rival's thighs, And forc'd him from the earth to rise; Then did his utmost vigour strain, To throw him to the earth again; And, with his own incumbent weight, Oppress'd him, in that helpless state. But, like Antæus, as we're told By those who sung in days of old, Tom seem'd, when he had touch'd the ground, With strength augmented, to rebound, Prepar'd to take another round. A desparate Rally now took place, Tom fix'd a Hit on Harry's face. Harry inflam'd, with anger burn'd, And such a Leveller return'd, So fierce a blow upon the head That Tom fell, and profusely bled. The time was past,—nor could he rise,— His breath heav'd short, clos'd were his eyes: To save him—vain was each endeavour— For he had given in for ever. Harry, though Victor, look'd aghast, As Tom, from London, breath'd his last; And wish'd that he had gain'd the day In some less inauspicious way. I have, he said, the Battle gain'd, And my known character sustain'd; But, Tom has taken such a banging, 'Tis well if I escape from hanging. All I can say for grief is vain, That I my purpose will maintain, Never, I swear, to fight again. —But Death appear'd!—“Once more, my “friend— “Yes, one Round more, and all will end.” The Seconds now, were fill'd with dread: Umpires, and Bottle-holders fled: Confusion reign'd throughout the scene, And the Crowds hurried from the Green. The roads were quickly cover'd o'er With Chaise and pair, and Chaise and four. While Curricles, and Gigs display The rapid fury of their way; And many a downfall grac'd the day. As Playgame claim'd a flying Bet, His new-built Tilbury was o'erset: Lord Gammon's Barouche met its fate, In contact with a Turnpike-Gate; And Ned Fly's Gig, that hurried after, Was plung'd into a pond of water: While Tom, to prove the proverb sound, Though he was wetted, was not drown'd. —But, would it not be vain to tell The various chances that befell Horsemen and Footmen, who that day, From Death's dread Challenge ran away? For when the affrighted Crowd was gone, And Death and Harry were alone, The Spectre hasten'd to propose That they should forthwith come to blows; But Harry thought it right to say, As no one's here to see fair play I'll try your strength another day: Besides, I know not how you're made: I look for substance—you're a shade— A bag of bones:—for aught I know, Old Broughton, from the Shades below: And though alive, I should not dread His power—I war not with the dead. Thus, keeping well his guard, he spoke. When grinning Death put in a stroke, Which did the short-liv'd round decide, And Sheffield Harry, in his pride, Was laid by Tom from London's side. 'Tis thus the Muse begs leave to close The History of Knock-down blows. The Vision of Skulls. WHAT is Matter, what is Spirit? What are the powers which they inherit? Or how act they upon each other, To live as Brother should—with Brother? An Answer, clear and full, I should Be glad to offer, if I could. —It is a metaphysic doubt How the mind frisks, and plays about, And sometimes makes a motley riot, When Morpheus keeps the body quiet; And, by no worldly care opprest, Our every sense is laid at rest. No sounds then reach the deafen'd ear, To the clos'd eye no forms appear: Feeling, and Taste, and Smell refuse Alike, their tributary dues. When Sleep has been invok'd to shed Its opiate poppies o'er the head, Then do strange figures oft arise, In various forms, to Fancy's eyes; Which from the senseless body breaks, And in some wild vagary wakes: Pleas'd, in Night's umbrage, to display Caricaturas of the day. —Now she o'erlooks the giddy steep, Or sails along the foamy deep: Delighted roams through Fairy bowers, Bedeck'd with never-fading flowers; Or bound in damp and darksome cave, Or struggling with th'impetuous wave —Now rais'd to pinnacles of Fame, Or damn'd by some inglorious name: Grasping a friend in warm embrace, Who long has run Life's eager race; Or following to the Tomb, with sorrow, Those who will glad the eye to-morrow. Sometimes we wake, from wealth and power, To Disappointment's painful hour; And from the velvet couch arise, To the flock-bed, where Sorrow lies. From falling rock and fancied billow, We joy to hug a real pillow; And smile, though still the bosom beats, To find we're safe between the sheets. Exterior objects do not give The cause by which such Fancies live: No real subject can be brought To fill the mind, or aid the thought, When all the powers of vision lie Beneath the lids that close the eye. Matter, 'tis plain, as all agree, By any Laws of Sympathy, Cannot, with a suspended sense, To thought or feeling make pretence: And if the Spirit could disown The Body's power, and act alone, It would proceed by sober rule, And never frisk, or play the fool, Nor turn the actions of the day Into Phantasmagoria. —Here then, I close the puzzling theme With my faint notion of a dream; And leave to others to express, If I have made a lucky guess. 'Tis from the senses that the soul Derives its power to controul The scheme of Life: for when they sleep It does not the least order keep, But moves with its fantastic train, In frolic sportings o'er the brain, And seems to strive, with all its clatter, To separate itself from matter. There are machines which owe the State Of all their movements to a weight: If the weight moves, they all go on Progressive, and their work is done; But, if it stops, they either cease, Or work confusion through the Piece. The clock struck eight—and, at the stroke, Sir Simon Bullion groan'd—and 'woke. The groan was follow'd with such sighs As made my Lady ope her eyes: With speed the curtain she undrew, Of her dear Knight to take a view, When she beheld him pale and wan, As if he'd been a murder'd man: But soon her fears he did beguile, When he turn'd round, and seem'd to smile. “I've had a dream,” Sir Simon said, “That still affects my mind with dread; “And if, my Love, you'll lend an ear, “Its frightful hist'ry you shall hear.”— My Lady, having smooth'd the bed, In listening posture plac'd her head: When, having given a Hem, or two, Sir Simon did the Tale pursue. —“I've dream'd I was—I know not where, Nor what strange bus'ness led me there; But, hurried by a crowd, I thought I saw the Portals of a Vault Which some uncommon sight possest, So I went in with all the rest. The spacious Cave which met my view, Was like a Church without a Pew. What I saw there was wond'rous strange: Around the place, in various range, On ev'ry side, above, below, In order due, a dismal show Of sculls innumerable stood; As if the dead from Noah's flood, Had, with successive, constant care, Sent all their Pericraniums there: But, whether moderns, or of yore, They now one solemn visage bore: No difference now discern'd the eye— All grinn'd in grim equality. “Some of the curious, bustling croud Rush'd back, while others scream'd aloud; But, while their terrors they betray'd, I did not feel myself afraid: Nay, by my side were two or three, Who seem'd as brave and bold as me: They took their quizzing glasses out, Quite at their ease, and look'd about. —Beneath the deep-roof'd vault there stood A Figure, neither flesh nor blood; Of horrid shape, and ghastly mien, Such as in pictures I have seen, To represent that foe to breath, Distinguish'd by the name of Death. Around there blaz'd a flaming brand, Which, in the stalking Spectre's hand, Wav'd, to and fro, a meteor bright, That fill'd each dark recess with light. “I thought, that now I wish'd to know The meaning of this mortal show: So ask'd the guide about the Tomb.— Call it, he said—a Catacomb. But though I do not know the word, I'll swear 'twas what I thought I heard; And, after breakfast, I'll go look If 'tis in Tommy's Spelling-book: And will it not be strange, my Dear, If in the Book it should appear, And that I, sleeping in my Bed, Should dream a word I never read.” —The Figure wav'd his torch around, And, in a voice, whose hollow sound Did, through the echoing vaults rebound, He bid us listen, as he read, The awful Hist'ry of the Dead.” “Those are the Kings who sceptres bore: Those Sculls the Crowns Imperial wore. —The Beauties of a former day There grin the passing years away. —These are the heads within whose bone The solemn light of Wisdom shone, And will diffuse, with Science sage, Its radiance o'er each future age. —Beneath this arch, in many a row, Valour displays its dismal show. They were all Knights of great renown Whom Honour cherish'd as its own: Nay, some of them shall tell the story Of what they did for Fame and Glory.” —The Phantom gave three heads a stroke With his fierce Torch, and thus they spoke. —Said one, “I was a soldier brave, Who found in war an early grave; But, e'er in Honour's field I died— I slew the Hero by my side.” The Hero, by his side, exclaim'd, —“'Twas my right arm your prowess tam'd: It was my sabre's well-aim'd blow, That laid your glittering figure low.” “Ho,” cried a third, “pray cease your pother, I saw you both kill one another.”— —Thus, though no arms, or legs had they, I thought they threaten'd an affray; And seem'd, without alarm or dread, To long to play the Loggerhead. I thought their clamour ne'er would cease: But the Torch wav'd, and all was peace. It seem'd most strange the sight I saw, That heads should speak 'gainst Nature's law, Without a Tongue,—nor move a Jaw.” “I humbly told the Guide, that I Was of the class of Chivalry. But that I was a Civic Knight, Who had much rather eat than sight. —Turn and look up, methought he said, At the huge Sculls above your head, Which are so thick, they might defy The balls of any musquetry. Those which there meet your curious ken, Belong'd to Knights and Aldermen, Who to the Sword's heroic work Preferr'd the seats of Knife and Fork; And, as they grin, the Jaws between, Their well-us'd, worn-out teeth are seen.— But all these mortal remnants stood, In such exact similitude, I could not see, with all my care, If any of my friends were there. —I then enquir'd, if no offence, And hop'd 'twas not impertinence, If he might tell whose fleshless face Was to fill up an empty space, Which seem'd so large, that I could swear, It was preserv'd for some Lord Mayor. He wav'd his Torch, and lost in smoke, 'Twas thus I thought the Spectre spoke.— —That place, Sir Simon, is your due: And shortly will be fill'd by you.— I felt his grasp around my neck, While the main bone it seem'd to break: And though I dream'd I was not dead, I thought that I had lost my head. —Then I awoke.—What joy to hear My Dolly snoring in my ear! To view her—what a charming sight! And O, th'unspeakable delight To find, when I could thus behold her, I had a head upon my shoulder.” My Lady now, with tender grace, Calm'd his alarms in her embrace. “I like this dream,” she said, “my dear: 'Tis a good omen—never fear. I'm sure you cannot have forgot, When once you dream'd that you were shot; And then you 'woke, alarm'd and frighted: But three weeks after you were knighted. —I'm quite enchanted! and forebode The prospect of great future good. Not long a simple Knight you'll be, And mark my certain Augury: For, in the Spectre's flaming brand, I see the Herald's Bloody Hand; And soon shall read in the Gazette— Sir Simon is a Baronet.” “I hope, that you divine aright,” Replied the half-recover'd Knight: “But though my tale so lucky seems, “I'd rather sleep without These Dreams.” The Porter's Chair. OF Things to Notions when we see A regular Conformity, (Such was the lesson of my youth) We may suppose we see the Truth. And when the contrary prevails, 'Tis Falshood, with its lying tales: But, the refinement of the day, Has settled it another way. Some men may now, nor do a wrong, Tell ready Falshoods all day long: Nay, 'tis the duty of their place, To utter practis'd Lies with grace; And, that their wants may be supplied, They keep them ready, cut and dried. John Lockfast had, for years, kept sentry, The Guardian of some Great Man's Entry, Which, not to give offence, we call By the more stylish name of Hall:— Prepar'd, at ev'ry sounding knock, The harrass'd Portal to unlock; And there or yes—or no—to say, As was the order of the day, —The tenant of an Easy Chair, His Life was free from bustling care: There, when by watchful nights distrest, He could recruit himself with rest. There he would sit and hear the News, With which the liv'ried train amuse Their fellow varlets, and relate As they in due attendance wait; The lucky fortune, or disasters Which happen to their Lords and Masters, And tittle-tattle of the heigh-days Of all the high-bred, tonish Ladies. Nay, in a language of their own, Talk o'er the scandal of the Town. Thus John, who had, for many a year, Been used the daily Tales to hear, The state domestic, could declare Of ev'ry house in ev'ry square. Nay, such was his experience thought In ev'ry thing which Service taught, That all the shoulder-knots in town Did his superior knowledge own, Nor fail'd the Porter sage to greet, As Oracle of Harley Street. —He knew the policy that waits On vigilance at Great Mens' gates; And how to gloss the daily lie With a soft, smiling gravity. Of all his bows would give the best To him who was a welcome guest; But could reply, in surly tone, To those he wanted to be gone: In short, he could adapt his face, As well as voice, to ev'ry case; And had the art, the first I know, When to return a Yes—or No. Nor was this all.—He could unfold The Language which the Knocker told; From Fashion's proud, imperious rap, To the poor Suppliant's humble tap: Whether 'twas Form, or Friendship came, Or disappointed Tradesman's claim: The sons of Frolic, and of Fun, Or the stroke flippant of a Dun. —Besides, John, though he did not know it, Was no mean Casuist,—and I'll show it. From living well, and sitting still, And of strong beer a daily fill, With other habits that combine, The props of Life to undermine, By slow degrees, John was, at length Diminish'd, both in health and strength; And, as he one night thought of dying, The thirty years he'd pass'd in lying, Came cross his mind, with the intent To quit his service, and repent. But after a full glass of Gin, He ask'd how it could be a sin, To do what ev'ry Servant did, And what his Lord and Lady bid? So while he whiff'd th'inspiring smoke, John, to himself, thus thought and spoke. “I say, what I am told to say, And 'tis my duty to obey. Nay, I believe it true, that I, When I am lying, do not lie: For, if I utter Falsehood's words, The Lie's my Lady's or my Lord's; And, though it may not be so civil, I think 'tis they should fear the Devil. I well remember, t'other day, I heard a rev'rend Prelate say, As from my Lord he went away, I am, indeed, with truth most fervent, Your Lordship's most devoted Servant; And that's a swinging one, I hold it, Though my Lord Archbishop told it. But that is call'd a mere expression, No sin at all, nor wants confession; And let me ask then, if I'm worse Than him—for using words of course? Besides, why should I feel alarm For saying what does no one harm? I've heard our Chaplain say, Denying Is not bona fide Lying: At least, that it will be forgiven By ev'ry Law that's made in Heaven Paley's Philosophy, Vol. III. p. 184..” But a most strange event drew nigh, To cut short this Soliloquy. —The clock struck twelve, a gentle knock Bid John the Mansion door unlock: He took a light, and left his chair, To see who ask'd admittance there. A horrid Figure met his eyes.— John instant thought of all his Lies. And struck with fear, aloud he squall'd: Murder, and Fire, and Thieves he bawl'd; Then hobbled off at helter skelter, And in the cellar sought for shelter. —My Lord and Lady were gone out, To some Fandango, Ball, or Rout, And all the upper Servants too, As second-table gentry do, Had, to ape their betters gone To a smart party of their own. —The maids up stairs with Tom were sitting; For he was sick, and they were knitting. They heard the noise;—Tom, with a grin, Said thieves were somewhere breaking in: Then seiz'd a pistol and a sword, And swore that none should rob my Lord. As Betty shriek'd, said jolly Nell, There are no thieves, I sure can tell: 'Tis that fool John, who, in a dream, Sees some strange thing that makes him scream: And if down stairs we gently creep, There we shall find him fast asleep. 'Twas but last week that he was found Bawling and sprawling on the ground, Swearing he dream'd that he was drown'd. —They went, and what a sight was there? Death sitting in the Porter's chair: While some strange bird was heard to squall, And flapp his wings around the Hall. Tom dropp'd the pistol from his hand: Nor could his strength the sword command. Bet shook with fear, nor was she slack, To trace her hurrying footsteps back; While poor, fat Nelly, in her fright, Fell from the stair-case, at the sight. It was a most tremendous fall, As she plung'd headlong to the Hall: Her forehead struck the marble floor:— She heav'd a sigh, and spoke no more. The Spectre calmly turn'd around, And saw his victim on the ground: Then grinn'd a smile, and wav'd his dart:— 'Tis done, he said,—and I depart. The door gap'd wide, as he withdrew;— When the Bird shriek'd, and with him flew. John, though still trembling with affright, Stole up, and view'd the dismal sight. Death still indeed possest his chair, For Tom had plac'd poor Nelly there. Said John, I ne'er again will stir, To let in such a Visiter; —And, if I live,—to-morrow morning, I'll surely give his Lordship warning. —In your warm place, good John remain:— Be where you will, he'll come again; Whate'er may be your future lot, Whether in Palace, Hall or Cot. Whene'er his hand salutes our gate, No lie will serve to make him wait: Whene'er he puts us to the trial, The scare-crow will take no denial; For, at the time he's pleas'd to come, We all of us, must be at Home. The Pantomime. JOKE, and Fun, and Frisk, and Folly, And ev'ry Foe to Melancholy, With airy step and smiling mien, Fill up the Pantomimic scene. Frolic spirits, light and gay, Chase the ev'ning gloom away: While they their lively whims pursue, What have we with Care to do? Tragedy is blood and slaughter:— A Tyrant's wife, or Prince's daughter, With some bold Lover in her train, Who by a rival's hand is slain;— With, right or wrong, a spice of reason To thwart Conspiracy and Treason: A fav'rite Slave, an infant Son, A battle lost, a battle won; Tears, shrieks, a dagger and a bowl, Of Tragic Dramas form the whole. Though, to add horror to the woe, And give the last Scene all its show, It were as well the Stage to spread With a slight sprinkle of the Dead. The Comic Muse, who in her freaks, With Life's domestic bus'ness seeks To call attention and to please With all man's home varieties, Will sometimes think it not a sin, With Death's grave pers'nage to begin. —But he's not seen:—she thinks its better To introduce him in a Letter; Or, to create a future laugh, In a Newspaper paragraph. An Uncle rich may be suppos'd, Perhaps in India, to have clos'd His mortal Life, which may produce Plenty of hopes and fears, for use; Turn up a score of odds and ends, Make friends of foes, and foes of friends. Besides, it ought not to be known, What he with all his wealth has done. In the third Act, perhaps, he'll come At some untoward moment home; And the whole Plot takes its complexion From this unlook'd for resurrection. Alarm and Joy, and Tricks and Lies, With a few snug perplexities; A subtle Valet, and a Maid, Who are well nurtur'd in their trade, With an outwitted rogue or two, To be expos'd to public view: A song so fond and so complying, In a fine strain, that's all but dying; Or with nice equivoques well stor'd, Which will be sure to be encor'd, Work up the int'rest of the Piece: Then all at once the jarrings cease. They yield to joy, and asking blessing, Some shaking hands, and some caressing; Till Hymen comes to say “good bye;— “I hope like the Comedy.” Farce is a comic view of Nature, Caricatur'd in plan and feature;— Nor does the Critic blame the scene If it but robs him of the spleen. The Unities may all give way, If it but makes the Audience gay. Vice, Virtue, Folly, Youth and Age, May form the bus'ness of the Stage; Sing-song and Dance may join their power To hasten on the laughing hour. But Death's too solemn to appear In all his sad apparel there; Unless he lends his dismal show To form a mockery of woe, And make a louder laugh succeed, When Life resuscitates the Dead. Some may remember well the time But it was in a Pantomime, When Death was seen to play his part, To grin a smile and wield a dart: Now upright in the tomb he stood, Now mantled in a sable hood: Then he would strut, stand still, or sit, And well nigh frighten half the Pit: He next, to follow up the Joke, Would take a pipe and gravely smoke. Pierrot and Pantaloon amaz'd, At the familiar Phantom gaz'd: Who, with his hideous grimaces, Would work up Terror in their faces; While Columbine with welcome glance, Invites him to the graceful Dance: At length his Frolics make it known— 'Tis Harlequin turn'd Skeleton. But soon the magic strip of wood Restores him all his flesh and blood, And makes the wond'ring children gape At each variety of shape: They almost doubt the astonish'd eyes Which views the tricks his sword supplies. Mountains that touch the clouds are seen To sink into the Ocean green; While on their sides the yielding trees, Transform'd to vessels, plough the seas. By the same metaphysic power The Rock melts to a Rosy Bower; The Rosy Bower, where Lovers meet, Passes away, and lo, a Street, With all its busy, bustling train, Which cities, rich in trade, contain. That's whirl'd away—and, in its stead, A stately building rears its head:— But still more strange when mortal man A Lion growls or swims a Swan. So quick the change of human nature To ev'ry form of living creature; That e'en Pythagoras might stare, Had he been a Spectator there. —Pierrot and Pantaloon pursue With all their clumsy retinue; But vain the toil with which they strive T'o'ertake the Motly Fugitive; Till kick'd and cuff'd in ev'ry place, They're forc'd at length to yield the chace; While Harlequin, each danger past, Enjoys his Columbine at last. Thus may Death's image aid delight 'Mid the gay scen'ry of the night: But, in the Pantomine of years, 'Tis serious all, when Death appears. For then no grin can Pierrot save; He finds the trap a real grave; Old Pantaloon with all his care, Will cease to be an Actor there. Lun's magic sword, with all its art, Must yield to Fate's resistless dart; And when Life's closing scene is o'er, The Curtain falls to rise no more. The Horse Race. I own the Simile is trite, But then it is correctly right; For ev'ry learned Critic knows That on all-fours it glibly goes, When the ever-varying strife That gives activity to Life, Is in its proper time and place, Compar'd to what is call'd a Race. For when we see each high-bred Horse Stretching for Conquest on the Course, What does he but man's toil display Through ev'ry hour of ev'ry day. —But we postpone the moral strain,— And call the Reader to the Plain, Where the assembled croud are met To wrangle, jangle, and to bet. 'Tis not to see the noble Steed Pace o'er the Down with matchless speed; 'Tis not to view the Rider's art When from the Goal he's call'd to start; Or where the contest may begin, That makes it doubtful who shall win;— 'Tis who, in honourable way, Shall of his neighbour make a prey: For this same curious, motly meeting Is somewhat of a Race for cheating. Jack Trimbush, in the country bred, To nothing useful turn'd his head; Cock-fighting, Racing, and the Games That sober Prudence never names, He long had practis'd, and was able To figure at a Billiard Table. An Uncle left him an estate That was not either small or great; But it was thought to bring him clear, At least a thousand pounds a year;— And, as 'twould be unjust to spare The praise where he can claim a share, Of that he took especial care. He sav'd what others give in bounty, And though he gambled round the county, 'Twas thought the conscientous sinner, Somehow contriv'd to be a winner. Now Jack was making to the Post The busy scene of Won and Lost, When to all those he saw around, He cried, “I offer fifty pound, “That to yon gambling place I get “Before you all.”—Death took the Bet. The 'Squire's Mare was Merry Joan, And Death rode, Scrambling Skeleton. They started, nor much time they lost Before they reach'd the gambling Host: But e'er they pass'd the betting Pole, Which was the terminating Goal, O'er a blind Fiddler Joan came down; With fatal force poor Jack was thrown, When a stone, on the verdure laid, Prov'd harder than the Rider's head. —Death wav'd aloft his dart, and fled. Upon the ground Jack senseless lay, And turn'd the bus'ness of the day: Horses and Jockies were forgot, 'Twas whether He would live or not. Says High-Game, “I'll lay five to one, “And who, among you, answers—Done? “That with Jack Trimbush 'tis all over, “And that he never will recover.” Cries Blacklegs, “Why, I'll take the Bet, “I think that He'll recover yet, “But then I must assistance get.” “I bar all aid,” exclaims the other; “No Doctor, if He were my Brother: “If a lancet breathes a vein “I recall my Bet again.” Such was the language round the Post, Till Trimbush yielded up the Ghost. The racing o'er, a Party met Neither to gamble nor to bet, But to enjoy the flow of soul Around the full, capacious Bowl. There was, howe'er, a dismal dearth, That evening, of their usual mirth: For Trimbush, and his fractur'd scull, Somehow or other, made them dull; Till thus Sir Jeffrey Graveairs spoke. “Since we are not dispos'd to joke, “I, who to-night possess the chair, “Call on our Friend the Doctor there, “To give us, nor will he refuse, “Some Ditty from his moral Muse. “'Twill be a lack and well-a-day, “Which we to poor Jack's mem'ry pay.” —The Doctor smil'd consent, and soon Began his sentimental tune. SONG. Nor Humour, nor Wit, I pretend to rehearse, My strain is all moral, and sober my verse; A subject to suit you, my song shall embrace; I sing of the Jockies in Life's busy race. Derry down, &amp;c. The Croud of Mankind in Contention we see, The High and the Low, of ev'ry degree; The King and the Beggar, the weak and the strong, E'en the blind grope their way, and the lame halt along. Ambition high mounted on Courser so fair, Who pants with impatience, and snuffs up the air; As he strains for the prize, behold, with a flirt, He falls from his horse, and is laid in the dirt. Great monarchs contend in destruction and wars, And strive for the Laurels and glory of Mars; But how oft, as they run through this perilous strife, This loses his Crown, and that loses his Life. The Miser now trembling, now sturdy and bold, As he thinks he shall lose, or may add to his gold, While heaping up treasure, he sinks 'neath the toil; And some profligate Spendthrift runs off with the spoil. The Sage who, in Schools and Academies bred, With store of deep learning has furnish'd his head, If he lets it not forth to embellish mankind, The Dunce and the Blockhead will leave him behind. The Virgin who full of her smiles and her charms, As she glides smoothly on scatters Love and alarms; Assisted by Prudence, should hold tight the rein, Or her charms and her beauty will conquer in vain. Tho' the young boast their strength, and the wealthy their gold; Tho' the Hero looks big 'cause He's valiant and bold; Tho' Kings wave their sceptres, Death strides on apace, And sooner or later will finish the Race. Where Reason directs let us haste on our way, When Discretion commands, let us wisely obey; And though, as we run, we may sometimes be past, We shall certainly win the best prize at the last. Then let not the contests that happen in life, Engender Confusion, Disorder and Strife; Let us run where bright Virtue distributes the prize; Tho' we lose it on earth, 'twill be found in the skies. Derry down, &amp;c. The Dram Shop. A Preacher, I remember well, Whose fashion was blunt Truths to tell, Harangu'd his Audience how to shun Old Nick, as round the world he run; And thus the fav'rite haunts defin'd Of the great Enemy of Mankind. “Avoid the place where the profane “Their faithless Mysteries maintain; “Nor let those mansions be explor'd “Where the Dice rattles on the board. “Nor risk your Labour's fair reward “By shuffling the deceitful Card. “In haste, pass by the tempting street “Where the alluring wantons meet; “For thus, as sure as Evil's evil, “You'll meet that Spirit call'd the Devil. “But above all, as you would shun “In Life and Death to be undone, “Indulge not in the liquid ill “That flows from the empoison'd Still, “Thither the Fiend loves to repair, “And Death, too oft, attends him there; “Who, in his never-ceasing rounds, “The Still-man aids as he compounds “Each mixture that's in daily strife “With Health, with Honour, and with Life. “The Dram-shop is the spot that yields “More various ills than all the fields “Where grow the Vices that disgrace “Th'existence of the human race. “The Town with beggars it supplies, “And almost fills th'Infirmaries; “Gives half their inmates to the jails, “And multiplies the Hangman's vails. “—Question the sturdy Lab'rer, why “He wears the rags of Poverty? “Wherefore his well-paid, daily task “Denies the Bread his Children ask? “It is the Dram's alluring cup “That swallows all his earnings up. “—Behold the squallid Mother's breast, “By the faint, sickly infant prest, “That ne'er the milk of Nature gives:— “Instead, the Suckling's lip receives “The sad Infusion which at length, “Destroys its puny, struggling strength; “Till Life its ev'ry aid denies, “And the poor, shrivell'd pigmy dies. “—Bid the Procuress mark the way “To make th'incautious Maid her prey, “The guards of Virtue to remove, “And smooth the path to lawless love; “'Tis the same deleterious power, “That crowns Seduction's fatal hour. “—Look at a shop whose windows show, “On ev'ry side, above, below, “The pledge of many a former day, “Of pressing Want the sad display. “Does it not wound each tender sense, “To see the poor who issue thence, “As to the Dram shop they repair, “And spend the borrow'd pittance there A Pawnbroker made the following reply to a Friend who expressed his surprize that he did not remove to a better Situation. —“I don't know a better: for it is within a very convenient distance from three Dram Shops.”? “—Behold, th'uplifted hand is seen:— “What threat'ning looks and angry mien: “While the foul execrating tongue “Does the fierce, clam'rous war prolong: “While e'en from female lips proceed, “The threat of many a bloody deed. “Thus Virtue's drown'd and Health destroy'd, “For the vile habit's seldom cloy'd. “Are then our Legislators loth “To curb the ills that ruin both; “Or wherefore do we daily meet “Such scenes as these in ev'ry street? “Do they then tempt the poor to pay “Their health and virtue to defray “The Nation's wants, and urge the Still, “The rav'nous Taxman's book to fill. “If they protect such baneful evil, “Nought will protect them from the Devil.” The Preacher thus his thoughts display'd: The Congregation groan'd and pray'd: And some few thought it not a sin, To go and toast his health—in Gin. —How oft' the sons of riot find Pleasure the poison of the mind: In Life, by Fire and Famine, less Sink to their Graves, than by excess. 'Tis Temperance gives the richest wealth; Contentment, Peace, and lasting Health: 'Tis Temperance that forms the sage: Is youth's best Guardian, and the Friend of Age. The Gaming Table. IF it were questioned of the Sage, Whose reas'ning mind, to hoary age, Has with a keen and curious ken, Examin'd well the ways of men, What is most likely to impart The worst of Frailties to the heart,— He would not hesitate to say, It is the excessive love of play: That Gamesters are but birds of prey; Who, like the vultures, as they fly Through the calm region of the sky, Look down with a rapacious joy, Eager to seize and to destroy. —Gaming, at first, a pleasure made, Becomes, at length, a rav'nous Trade. When the hand shakes the treach'rous dice, The heart's the seat of ev'ry vice, The most abhorrent from the plan That Virtue has mark'd out for man. In that fell moment Friendship dies, Love, startled, from the bosom flies, And Nature—Nature's self belies:— Nay, does not the fierce Lust proceed To consecrate the blackest deed. —Bacon, that first of Men, has said, The Gamester's to each virtue dead, And with th'accursed rage endued, Has not a sense of what is good; While his predominance in ill, Bears just proportion to the skill, With which his practic'd mind can guard The doubtful throw, the casual Card. How oft the Youth, to virtue bred And born to wealth, whose parents dead Have left him, through the world to stray; In blooming Manhood's early day, Becomes the wily Sharper's prey. At first He's taught to find delight In those amusements of the night, Where men of courtly manners meet To ply the progress of deceit. Led on, at length, by slow degrees, All unsuspecting, and at ease, To ev'ry earthly comfort blind, The love of Play absorbs his mind, Nor suffers any other care To find a free Admission there. Then, to supply the wager'd gold, His woods are fell'd, his trees are sold; And the last hazard of the die Leaves him to want and misery; While the false friend, who caus'd his ruin, Sits, careless of the foul undoing: And, should Despair attempt the blow That calms at once all human woe, 'Twill scarce arrest th'impending throw. Is he, who by Despair is led To give a wife and infants bread, By a mere threat'ning to purvey From Trav'llers on the public way? Is such a deed, which, when 'tis done, May frighten some, but ruin none; Is such a deed, which, like a dart, Pierces the trembling Culprit's heart, And, springing from no vile intent, To find the fatal punishment? Is such a wretched man to die On Gallows tree in infamy? While he, who in gay plenty lives On the vile gains which gaming gives, Shall be received with ease and glee, And marks of polish'd courtesy, In those bright circles, where the train Of Fashion hold their splendid reign; Though many a Dupe may curse the hour, When Fortune's false, insidious power Allur'd them to his treach'rous hand, That could th'obedient card command, Or tell the fabricated die To aid the well-plann'd treachery. Is there in Reason's view a scene Of a more fell and horrid mien? Is there to calm Reflection's eye A nest of greater villainy, Than where the Pandemoniums meet,— Or to be cheated, or to cheat The Gaming Houses of an inferior kind, in the neighbourhood of St. James's, are denominated “Hells.”? Is there a vice that is not there? Is there a sense that good men share? Is there an oath that is not heard? Is there a curse that's not preferr'd? Does not the disappointing die Call forth the horrid blasphemy? And in the smile of him who wins, Each feature, as it brightens, sins. If any one should wish to scan The God-like countenance of man, When Passion shapes it to descend Into the visage of a Fiend; To haunts like these he may repair:— He'll find the frightful picture there. But Death, who as he roams about, May find the Gaming Table out;— And, when he shows his ghastly grin, The knowing ones are taken in. —The lucky Phantom's sure to win. He enters,—when the fearful shout Echos around, of—turn him out. No, he replies—that Gold is mine:— Gamester, that Gold you must resign. —Now Life's the Main, the Spectre cries:— He throws—and lo!—The Gamester dies. The Battle. LIFE's frail and perishable hour Has oft been liken'd to a flower, Which first a verdant leaf displays Amid the show'rs of vernal days, And Summer opens to the Sun; But Autumn sees its beauty gone: Chill'd by Winter cold it lies, To be renew'd 'neath milder skies. Such is the whole progressive span That marks the longest life of Man: But, by experience, we are taught The various means that make it short. Disease, with its destructive Train, And all the Family of Pain; These are the Ministers that wait Upon the dread commands of Fate. —Fever's fierce and burning heat Which makes each pulse with fury beat; Pallid Ague that, by turns, Shakes with tremors cold, or burns With parching pain;—the Stone, That parent of the heaving groan; The Gout, and all its racking pains, Or Frenzy, writhing in its chains, And many an ill of doubtful name That harrasses the human frame. Nor these alone: Heart-breaking Care; With pining Love, and fell despair; Or Passion's unreflecting rage, Which Reason trembles to assuage;— They, in their various natures, pave Man's passage to the gloomy grave, His mortal destiny: but these Waste mankind by slow degrees, While Nature's all-prolific power Supplies such losses every hour. —No, 'tis the vast, ensanguin'd plain Cover'd with thousands of the slain, Where the fell Deity of War Drives onward in his fatal Car: 'Tis there th'affrighted eye can trace The power that thins the human race. The Sun his early beams displays And tips the hills with golden rays; Then glitters on the martial show, That covers all the vale below; Where the embattel'd armies wait, Impatient for the word of Fate; While Death expects, in dire array, The victims of the bloody day. Thousands who saw the Sun arise, And with its bright beams streak the skies, E'er his orb sinks into the main, In ghastly shapes will strew the plain. E'er his allotted Circuit's run, What glory will be lost and won, Glory, the dearly purchas'd prize Of widow's tears, of orphans' cries; Of matrons—shrieking wild with woe; Of cities, and their walls laid low; Of chrystal streams bestain'd with gore; Of the rich vallies, that no more Their plenty to the sickle yields; While Blood's the Harvest of the fields. Man could not be by Nature made For War's destructive, cruel trade; To change the joys of social Life, For savage deeds of martial Strife. He who is born to weep with those Who feel the weight of human woes; He, whose first joy is to relieve The aching hearts of those who grieve; He, whose happier passions move, Faithful to Friendship and to Love: Is He by Nature form'd to wield The sabre in the tented field? What though he may the battle try, Summon'd by stern Necessity; What, though his country's wrongs may charm The patriot citizen to arm, And join the cohorts to oppose The darings of his country's foes,— He, born with Love to be endued, And Charity, Life's real good, Was never form'd to deal in blood. It cannot with his virtues suit, For the stern trump to change the lute; Or quit, without a deep-drawn sigh, The scene of peace and harmony. The mother, when she lulls to rest Th'unconscious infant on her breast; When, as she views the Babe, her eye Glances with tender extasy: She offers up the secret prayer To Heaven, for its protecting care; To guard him from the ills that wait Upon his weak and helpless state. Give him strength, and grant him health; Give him Virtue, crown'd with wealth;— That thus her Infant may be blest, Is the maternal, fond request. She thinks not of the woe that springs From the ambitious pride of kings; Nor looks, with premature alarms, To hostile feats and deeds of arms; Nor are her wishes e'er beguil'd, To see a Hero in her child. With the pale lily and the rose, She decks the smiling Urchin's brows; Nor does Affection's hand prepare To place the verdant Laurel there, Emblem of Honour gain'd in war. Virtue, she knows, may find its meed, Where daring warriors never bleed; And Honour may enjoy renown Without the Victor's laureate crown. For added evils wherefore roam, All find enough of ill at home; If ill it should be call'd that proves The noble Heart which Virtue loves. War's the Disease of nations, sent By Heaven, as awful punishment, At once to chasten, and chastise Mankind's combin'd enormities; And when its standard is unfurl'd, What woes assail the trembling world. Murder, and Massacre and Spoil, Pursued with unremitting toil In ev'ry clime, on ev'ry soil. Amid the Battle's bloody hour, Death brandishes his utmost power; And thousands in a moment fall, Beneath that Strength which conquers all. When He his potent arm uprears, In ev'ry shape his dart appears, Which the fell arts of War employ With deadly genius to destroy. When the sword strikes the struggling foe, 'Tis Death directs the fatal blow: When the shaft makes the bosom bleed, 'Tis Death directs the fatal speed: When the loud cannon breathes, its breath Is the destructive fume of Death. Where'er he waves his torch on high, The victors and the vanquish'd die; And Fame's too oft the only meed Or of the living, or the dead. —O blest be that benignant hour, When chast'ning Justice calms its power: Bids all the warring contests cease, And gives the humbled Nations peace. The Wedding. THERE is a proverb that is known By ev'ry lively Miss in Town, For whom Love lies in ambuscade, —That Marriages in Heaven are made. Thus, when the Fair, resolv'd to wed, Receives the Captain to her bed, Whose only fortune is his pay Of nothing like a pound per day, A father's anger to assuage, And calm an humbled Mother's rage, She says, in hopes to be forgiven, The nuptial knot was tied in Heaven. How could she help it—when her Love Was govern'd by the powers above; And therefore would Papa persuade That this same match was wisely made; Nay, asks the Dower he would accord, As if her Spouse had been a Lord. —But 'tis not Birth, nor is it gold That does the sacred Union hold In that firm fondness which will last, When Beauty, and when years are past. Affection is the Knot that binds In silken cord, congenial minds; And, e'en, in with'ring age will bloom, To grace the confines of the tomb: Thus Hymen often doth beguile The Heart, though Fortune does not smile; And turns, disgusted, from the great, Beneath the domes of Wealth and State. If Hymen would with Plutus rove, And always seek the God of Love; Nor ever quit the common shrine, When they the Nuptial Contract sign: If Cupid ne'er would make pretence Unless to Beauty, Wit, or Sense, And Plutus ever ready be To crown each faithful Votary, And Hymen, not a step proceed, 'Till his Associates were agreed, Who would not seek the Nuptial State, Who would not be a married mate? Nay, scarce upon this earthly round Would one old Bachelor be found. But 'tis not form'd by Nature's plan To give such Happiness to Man: It would be folly then to wonder That Love and Plutus keep asunder; For Hymen's ever at their will Their sep'rate pleasure to fulfil; Though Plutus seems to take the lead Of Love, in matrimonial deed: Such is, at least, the gen'ral creed:— And such Amelia's tale will prove Who married Wealth, nor thought of Love. She was, 'tis true, in Fashion bred, With all those whimsies in her head, With all those hopes, within her heart, That High-life fantasies impart. Her glass return'd the lovely face, Her ev'ry motion beam'd with grace, Which might the ardent wish inspire, And bid each gazing eye admire; So that she thought, let who will woe me, 'Tis some Adonis shall subdue me; For I'm not yet so foolish grown, To wed a form unlike my own. But 'twill not do, unless his door, Beholds each day, the coach-and-four; Or, if 'tis just to take the air, The sprightly Curricle and pair, Or the groom with the high-bred mare. Nor must the dear Adonis stint her, To one grand Fete through one long winter; But, by the splendour of each treat, To lay all Fashion at her feet. Thus did her flatt'ring hopes go on From seventeen years to twenty-one: But no Adonis yet appears, And all her hopes were turn'd to fears. —Instead, an ancient tatter'd Beau Who totter'd on threescore, or so, Resolv'd to close his rakish Life, With a young fashionable wife. Amelia caught his gloting eye, And heard his fond Idolatry; When all that could her pride content, In figure, wealth, and settlement, Was plac'd at her supreme command, To bribe the Fair to yield her hand. Amelia conn'd the matter o'er, Sigh'd twenty-one, and then threescore. The offer she would say is fair, But then there's no Adonis there; And for Adonis should I stay, 'Till all my Beauties fade away; Should I refuse the offer'd Lot I might e'en live to be forgot. —Besides, my dear, prolific mother Gave me five Sisters, and a Brother; So that my Dower will ne'er invite A match beyond a country Knight;— My Fortune may not e'en inspire The Courtship of a mortgag'd 'Squire. —All things consider'd, 'twill be wise My love-lorn hopes to sacrifice, And take Sir John, let who will slout him, With all his wealth and years about him; Nay, should the Veteran not survive The day when I am twenty-five, So wealthy, and yet handsome still, I shall have Lovers at my will, And stand a better chance to find A young Adonis to my mind:— But that the world may not upbraid me, It is my mother shall persuade me; And thus to give the matter weight, I for a week will hesitate. This interval Mamma employs To influence her Daughter's choice, And urges in a different way The self-same reasons ev'ry day. “I own, my Dear, it is too true, “Sir John's a horrid form to view. “But he pays nobly for the pride “Of having such a lovely Bride, “And in the matrimonial dish, “We can't have all that we can wish: “Let Fortune cook it how it will, “There will be something wanting still. “—A proverb oft the truth displays, “And think on what this proverb says— “You'd better be an old man's darling “Than hear a young man's constant snarling.— “He says, indeed, he's but threescore, “But I know that He's something more; “While from the Life which he has past, “The Doctors say he cannot last. “It seems, that more than half the year “He has the Gout, and can't appear; “At least, his limping form is seen, “Shelter'd within a gilded screen. “In this same calculating age, “When Int'rest is the growing rage, “A prospect, with such golden views, “It would be madness to refuse. “There's many a Dutchess cannot prove “Such splendid marks of gen'rous Love “As he proposes:—count them o'er, “And tell me, would you wish for more. “Envy may scoff, and some may smile, “But think on what you'll gain the while. “Few, few, among the world's gay throng “Will say, dear Girl, you've acted wrong, “If you with prudence play your part, “Nor let the world corrupt your heart, “When as a Widow you appear “With twice three thousand pounds a year, “And all the fine things which the pride “Of doting Love, will give beside. “My counsel is, the proffer'd boon “Should be receiv'd this afternoon: “This moment let your mother write “To ease the gallant, suff'ring Knight; “To tell him, that at length, you yield, “And leave him Master of the field; “But, to conclude this long debate, “Think, think on his precarious state. “The bus'ness must not be delay'd, “Or e'er the settlements are made, “He to that region may be flown “Where Marriages are never known.” 'Twas done:—In haste the forms proceed; The Lawyers all are doubly fee'd; The Fashion-shops work night and day, To furnish out the rich array, That young Amelia might be seen, The image of the Cyprian queen; When, 'mid Idalian rites she moves, Surrounded by th'admiring Loves; Such costly jewels now appear To shine and dangle in her ear, To bind her arms, and deck her hair, To make the fairest look more fair, Such as a Sultan seldom gave To the Seraglio's fav'rite Slave. In short, it was the tempting store Of am'rous wealth at sixty-four. At length arriv'd th'appointed Day, When all, but Emily, were gay. Still her pale lips, however loth, To the old Bridegroom plight their troth; While he affects a simp'ring grace, Or calls a smirk into his face. Thus, as she saw him by her stand, And felt his chilly, palsied hand, The humbling tear bedew'd her eyes, And mourn'd her own sad sacrifice: Nor could she draw a faint supply Of Comfort, e'en from Vanity. In spite of all her splendid show, She inly curs'd the gilded woe; And, in the secret of her mind, Call'd Death—the Union to unbind; Nor call'd in vain.—In surplice drest, At once the Bridesman and the Priest, 'Twas Death who at the Altar heard The inward wish that she preferr'd; And when the sacred knot was tied, The Bridegroom in a moment died, And left her, as she just had pray'd— A widow'd Bride, a married Maid. She now her gawds to sables turns, And in all due Apparel mourns. But though, by some good folks 'tis said, That marriages in Heaven are made, She thinks, to make the Proverb even, That they are sometimes loos'd in Heaven. The Skaiters. WATER and Earth, and Air and Fire, All, in their different ways conspire, Our Life's frail nature to support; Or, as it happens, cut it short. Not a day passes but 'tis found That some are burn'd, or some are drown'd. Does not the foul and fœtid breath Of some disease, cause daily death? And who, on Earth's vast space can tell The Spot where Danger does not dwell? The very Elements, that tend To give us Life, produce our end. Death is not only here and there, His fearful power is every where. He sails, upon his baleful wing, Amid the zephyrs of the spring; He can his deadly frolics play Beneath the Summer's burning ray; While Autumn's fruit, at his command, Shall drop ripe from the gatherer's hand; He calls obedient to his power, Each pastime of the wint'ry hour; Whether we seek the painted dome, Or are invited forth to roam, When the earth is fast bound in frost, And ev'ry stream in ice is lost. Should then the fatal Shape incline To glide along the Serpentine, How many skaiting folks would he Throw into mortal jeopardy: Away, in vain, the Skaiters skim, 'Tis all in vain that they can swim. If he but waves his mystic dart, Th'obedient Ice begins to part; And, while the opening chink receives The hapless groupe, he grins, and leaves Some of the smartest blades in town To squall, to flounder, and to drown. The Duel. HONOUR's a very common word, By all and ev'ry where preferr'd. But what's its meaning,—where's the Key, That will unlock the Mystery? It seems to change in ev'ry street, And with each person that we meet. —Ask the old Maid of fifty-three, She whispers, 'tis Virginity. —Ask the gay Virgin, in her teens, What this self-same expression means? She'll say, when a young Miss can boast, To be an universal Toast. —In Bond-street, of the Loungers there Enquire for Honour,—when and where 'Tis to be found:—Why some will say In paying debts, when lost at play: In guiding, with adroit command, The gay Barouche and four-in-hand; With equal grace to swear and rail As any Coachman of a Mail. —If in your walks you chance to pop Your head into a Tradesman's shop, What though he lies from morn to night, If he can get a Guinea by't, Let him but pay his Bills when due; He is a Man of Honour too. —The Jobber in the Stock Exchange, Call him a Rogue—he'll say 'tis strange; For if he's neither Bull nor Bear, He is a Man of Honour there. Go to the Temple, or Gray's Inn, And ask where Honour's to be seen?— The Porter answers, 'tis not known Within those quarters of the Town; But if you touch him with a Fee, Though all in vain, He'll go and see. —The Soldier, if you name the word, Lays his rough hand upon his Sword; Then points in silence to the scar, Won 'mid the bloody toils of War. What says Religion?—She replies, Honour within the bosom lies:— The Steers-man of our moral frame, Honour and Conscience are the same: But there's an Engine in the breast, Which some folks call Self-Interest, That in this busy world of our's, Possesses those resistless powers, That sometimes change the name and nature The very form and shape and feature Of all the principles which plan The moral Institute of Man; And, like the Alchemy of old, Strives to convert them into Gold. —My Grandame told me, in my youth, Honour's another word for Truth; But now I find, some years gone by, 'Tis Honour to maintain a lie. Nay, do not men of Honour hold That Truth's not always to be told? But says the world, and be it known, I have an Honour of my own, Whose Spirit ever is awake Revenge, for certain wrongs, to take; Whose keen impatience will not wait For Lawyers to accommodate: An insult of whatever kind, A blow before, a kick behind; An idle word, a booby drunk, A quarrel for a Playhouse punk.— —'Tis daily seen, with all its worth, What Folly calls this Honour forth. Jack Tetchy, who for several years Captain had been of Volunteers; And Billy Diaper, who bore The Colours in the self-same Corps, In a Cook's-shop by chance had met, A little noon-tide prog to get. Jack, who look'd big, and munching stood, Swore that the Cheese-cakes were not good;— While Billy said—they were a treat, The best that he had ever eat. “Then Sir, you mean to say, I lie,” Was the impetuous, quick reply. “If you should wish to take it so,” Says Billy, “I shall not say no.” Words begat words, and threaten'd blows, When Jack took Billy by the nose. This was an insult too severe For a brave Soldier's pride to bear. 'Twas Honour nam'd the following day: The angry Heroes both obey; When, without fear of wounds or blood, They bravely met at Hornsey Wood. The Seconds now prepare the Fuel Which forms the Honour of a Duel: A Surgeon too was near the ground, T'extract a ball, or dress a wound. Jack was dim-ey'd, and made a claim To use a glass, to aid his aim. —The Combatants their triggers drew; Th'opposing Bullets instant flew; A fatal Ball struck Billy's paunch, Ek'd out with many a Ham and Haunch: With agony he loudly squall'd; Th'expecting Doctor's quickly call'd; But, e'er he can approach the scene, Death had thought fit to intervene, And prov'd his strength: for, in a crack He threw fat Billy 'cross his back. —Alarm'd, the diff'rent parties run;— The work of Honour now was done. The Bishop and Death. THUS are Death's mortal weapons hurl'd, Resistless on a prostrate world; The young, the old, the grave, the gay, His potent summons all obey. But can no remedy be found To sooth the rancour of his wound? Is Gilead of her Balm bereft, And frail Creation hopeless left? Say, will no white-rob'd Son of Light, Swift darting from his Heavenly height, Here deign to take his hallow'd stand, And shed Salvation round the Land? Mortals, the aid you wish is near, No light-clad angel need appear, Prophetic voice, and Gospel Grace, May well supply an Angel's place; Yes, Gospel Truth's unerring sound, Has long been heard the world around; And He, who will not these attend, Should dead men rise, or Saints descend; Would still, in unbelieving mood, Refuse the bliss by which he's woo'd; Would not attend though rocks should speak, Or voice from bursting mountains break. 'Twas the great Messenger from Heaven, By whom the sacred word was given, The Son of God's eternal Love Descended from the Heaven above, To arm frail man for combat high, Against his last Great Enemy; To guard him in the awful strife, And point the way through death to life. Himself the arduous conflict tried, And rose triumphant though he died. His faithful followers here behold Amidst Death's Terrors calmly bold: A Prelate full of Heavenly Grace, High rais'd in virtue as in place; One who God's people ne'er betray'd, Nor practis'd other than he said. His early age to learning given, Prepar'd him for the task of Heaven: Science, thy thorny paths he trod, Through Nature's works, to Nature's God; Till now intent on Heavenly good, The Spirit caught him where it would, And tipt his tongue with Coal of Fire, And bade the hallow'd flame aspire. The Holy word, by day, by night, At once his study and delight; Anxious he weighs each verse each line, And human learning aids divine; But not alone to study given, He shews, and leads the path to Heaven. Still, instant by the sick man's bed, He cheers his heart and lifts his head: His counsels tott'ring virtue stay, At his rebuke vice shrinks away. Such, such of old good Pastors were, Such Cranmer—Wilson—Latimer. All humbler duties duly paid, At last, the Mitre decks his head; Still modest in his high degree, Still grac'd with meek humility. Another glory yet remains, And that by death the good man gains; An heavenly crown, bright heritage, Amid the Saints of ev'ry Age. What more can Heaven on man bestow, Or man deserve of God below? Now call'd to that, devoid of fear, He sees the close of Life is near; Religion beaming in his heart, He heeds not Death's impending dart: His faithful friend directs the way To regions of eternal day. Where then thy sting, dread tyrant, where The triumph to thy Pride so dear, Harmless thy boasted dart is found:— 'Tis Sin gives venom to the wound. —The body, given him at his birth, Must mingle with its native earth. 'Gainst that alone Death's darts prevail, Against th'immortal parts they fail: The fragil frame sinks to the tomb, There rests amid sepulchral gloom; From thence, more glorious to arise, And join its partner in the skies; No longer pain or care to know, Or changes that man feels below; But change of Bliss and Pleasure pure, And Peace that ever shall endure. —As he whose form the fiend sustain'd, When Eve's too easy faith he gain'd; That beast, the subtlest of the field, As Winter's chilling rigours yield, And earth receives Spring's tepid ray, Casts his old Coil in Scorn away; Darts from his Cave in vigour bold, And rears his crest of burnish'd gold, Renew'd with the renewing year, Again to droop in Autumn sear:— But Man, the sleep of Death once o'er, Shall rise renew'd, to fall no more.

      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. The Suicide. THE various ways, the various shapes, By which imprison'd man escapes From Life's enclosure, to the clime That beams beyond the reach of time, The narratives of every day Do to reflection's eye display. Naked we issue from the womb, Naked we seek the destin'd tomb: What troubles are we form'd to brave, Between the cradle and the grave, If 'tis the sacred will of Heaven That years and length of days are given! The new-born infant, with his breath, Imbibes the mortal seeds of death; And ev'ry day and ev'ry hour May yield him to the Tyrant's power. While hanging on his mother's breast, Nourish'd and fondled and carest, How oft he mocks the tender care That dotes as he is clinging there: He scarce moans forth one feeble cry, And his first morrow sees him die: Nay, e'er his eyes behold the sun, Perhaps his puny race is run. If Death could feel, its stern decree Would spare our prattling Infancy: That age whose looks, whose words dispense Th'attractive charms of Innocence; That April morn on which appears The blended scene of smiles and tears, Whose pantomimic grace affords The meaning of half utter'd words: But Infancy's enchanting smile Does not th'unpitying power beguile; For when the fatal arrow flies, The prattler's dumb,—the Cherub dies. Nor yet when Reason's dawning hour Beams on the mind its rip'ning power, And from the Nurs'ry goes the Boy, His Father's Heir, his Mother's Joy, To sink beneath the rigid rule Of some learn'd Pedagogue at school; Yet still he grieves not, as he views The early flowers which Science strews Around his path, while she bestows The chaplet rude to deck his brows. —What though his unform'd thoughts impart The glowing virtues of his heart; What though the lovliest bloom appears, Fair promise of maturer years, While Hyacinthine ringlets grace The rosy honours of his face, Death, in an unexpected hour, May crop at once the op'ning flower, So sweet, so pleasing to the eye; And, as its promis'd virtues die, Leave fond Affection, where they sleep, To rear the sculptur'd tomb, and weep. The Age of Passion next succeeds:— Love wounds; the tender bosom bleeds;— Young Honour wakes the glowing fire; The eager ear to Pleasure's lyre Enraptur'd yields, nor thinks the strain Which Syrens sing can foster pain. Love's arrow rankling in the breast Not only robs each hour of rest, But, barb'd with hopeless passion, proves The dart of Death to her who loves. —How many an ardent warrior stains With his young blood, th'embattled plains; When the plum'd helm and pomp of war Are left to grace the funeral car: And ah, too oft, in Life's gay bloom Licentious pleasure finds a tomb. Reason, that grave, and solemn sage, In vain may ope th'instructive page, To guide the ardent hopes of youth In the unerring ways of truth; In vain with awful voice impart Its sober warnings to the heart, Where the warm passions claim controul, O'er the best impulse of the soul. —If Reason finds her efforts vain, The Dance of Pleasure leads to pain; And all the gifts that Fortune pours Prove poison, deck'd with fading flowers. —If hurrying passion leads the way, And governs with superior sway, If it looks round for its delights In fev'rish days and wanton nights, 'Tis not the mind alone that lies, Depriv'd of its best energies; But Life itself may find its fate, A painful end, a shorten'd date. Then come the years, when other cares And other wants our nature shares; Ambition claims the anxious hour, And seeks the dang'rous road to power. —Perils surround the giddy heights, Whose sun-clad eminence invites The votaries of Pride to find The Rod by which to rule mankind; The art their rivals to subdue And gain the honours they pursue: But while the cringing croud below To the rais'd Idol humbly bow; The dark storm lowers, the summit shakes Upon his head the tempest breaks, And from his dream the proud man wakes; Wakes, in amazement sad, to feel The sudden whirl of Fortune's wheel, Nor daring his disgrace to brave, Forsaken, sinks into the grave. —Wealth too, the busy wish employs, And added gold the mind enjoys. How many, quitting health and ease, 'Mid storms and tempests plough the seas, To distant climes delighted roam, To bring the gainful venture home, But oft upon some distant coast, They and their treasures all are lost. At length comes the concluding stage Of Life's long, weary pilgrimage; When Age has caught us in its clutch, And the weak limbs demand the crutch; When wrinkled brow and hoary head Mark that so many years are fled, Too blest, if Wisdom doth befriend And teach our life to love its end. But still unsung the various ills Which man throughout Life's journey feels; Or hanging daily o'er our head, We all are doom'd to know, or dread, And serve to checquer every scene, Where casual pleasures intervene. The noisome pestilence by day That makes of crowds a sudden prey; The dart that in the darksome night Swiftly wings its secret flight: The slow disease and subtle pain Which Nature's destin'd to sustain; The loud and agonising groan That waits upon the racking stone; The shaking Ague's wasting power, And the fierce Fever's raging hour: The Paralytic's trembling hand That its own Master's fond command Refuses to obey; the ear That numb'd and deafen'd cannot hear: When all the organs of the eye, Darken'd, in dim suffusion lie; And every ray of cheering light Is lost in everlasting night. Such are among the evils sent To plague our fleshly tenement; But there are others which we find The busy Tort'rers of the mind. Do we not see what numbers prove The wounds of disappointed Love; And all the jealous pangs that wait Upon a favour'd rival's fate? —What anxious cares disturb his breast, Who early rises—late takes rest; And, though borne on by Fortune's gale, At length may find his prospects fail: Just as he thinks the voyage o'er, Resolv'd to risk and toil no more, He may be wreck'd upon the shore. —To-day a hated foe is seen, With scornful air and haughty mien, Enjoying all the prosp'rous state, Which Chance has given to make him great: To-morrow, weeping we attend The Dirges of a faithful Friend. —The loss of Honour's due reward; By Vice the meed of Virtue shar'd,— —The noblest feelings of the heart, Become the Dupes of knavish art. —Justice perverted, and the Laws Check'd in their course by quirks and flaws, Or, turn'd and twin'd, too often prove Worse than the wrongs they should remove. —Pretending Friendship's fair deceit; And false caresses of the great; The Courtier's Lie clad in grimace, Th'unfeeling heart, with smiling face; And Calumny, for ever wrong, With Aspic poison 'neath its tongue, An Angel's virtues will decry, By the shrewd hint or bare-fac'd lie, Which the apt world too well receives, And listens while the Falsehood lives. —Again,—what various trouble fills The Volume of domestic Ills, The wife weeps o'er the Husband's bier, A Husband dead demands the tear; A child with all its promis'd bloom, Sinks prematurely to the tomb, And various accidents befall The common progress of us all. Such are the woes ordain'd by Fate, In which it seems our mortal state Must more, or less, participate: Though thanks to Heaven, while these annoy, We have a portion too of joy. But still, whate'er may be our share Of mortal pain and human care, 'Tis Heaven inflicts, and man should bear. What, though self-murd'ring Brutus bled, And Cato made the weapon red In his own blood, the Stoic's rage That shines upon th'Historic page, Must yield, in energy of mind, To him who, patient and resign'd To Heaven's high will and wise decree, Whate'er the heavy trial may be, Beneath it all lives bravely on, Till Nature's doubtful course is run. Philosophy, in all its Pride, Cannot defend the Suicide, By any Law, by any rule In Reason's or Religion's school: Life's the peculiar gift of Heav'n, And He alone by whom 'tis given, Can have alone the power to give The stroke by which we cease to live. Is Man to say—I've reach'd the goal, I'll now dismiss th'imprison'd soul; With my own hand I'll ope the way From its base tenement of clay; Tir'd of its suff'rings here below, I'll loose it from this scene of woe; I'll prune its wings and let it fly, To seek again its native sky: Yes, I will quench my mortal breath, I'll be the judge of Life and Death.— But should, in its immortal sphere, Say, should th'unsummon'd soul appear What, what may be the sentence there! Stay then thy hand, e'er 'tis too late, Nor madly rush upon thy Fate! Thou shudd'rest at the horrid mood, When Murder drinks a brother's blood; And dare you hope for Virtue's crown, When your arm'd hand draws forth your own! Does He the high behests fulfill, Of Heav'nly power, of Heav'nly will, Who, with a murm'ring tongue complains, That he is charg'd with mortal pains, More than his frame is form'd to bear? Will he his Maker's Laws declare Harsh and unjust;—shall he, weak man, Through Passion's mist, presume to scan The views mysterious that guide Our passage o'er the tossing tide Of chance and pain;—Say, shall he dare To fly what he was born to bear, Nor ask of Patience to supply The strong and guardian panoply, That, in each trial, will befriend His warfare to th'appointed end. The very structure of our frame Does Self-destruction's crime disclaim. Man may announce,—I'll move, I'll run, I'll speak, I'll gaze,—and it is done. The limbs are prone to his command: The nimble feet, the grasping hand, And every organic sense Submits to his Omnipotence:— But, if he idly says,—I'll die;— Nature refuses to comply: Weak is his unassisted will; And his mere wishes do not kill. But, if determin'd to succeed, And perpetrate the fatal deed, He must, alas, call to his aid, Th'exploding burst, the sharpen'd blade, Or poison'd cup,—or end the dream Of Horror in the troubled Stream. Reason 'tis not, as some have said, By vain Philosophy betray'd, To Life's apportion'd ills to yield, And force Death to th'untimely field. —'Tis the Disease that's sometimes seen, With pallid look, and haggard mien, Which its black visions doth impart To sadden, and to chill the heart; While Melancholy, silent maid, Of its own gloomy thoughts afraid, Refines the musings that supply The wish, and the resolve to die. —Or it is Passion's raging burst That seeks the best and does the worst, Whose impulse, to reflection blind, Drives reason from the startled mind; And aggravating, by its power, The poignant suff'ring of the hour, Hastes the dread comfort to prepare, And finds the refuge of Despair. Alas, I've, such a tale to tell Of one who lov'd, but lov'd too well. The Fair was grac'd with every charm That can the coldest bosom warm; And Virtue's self was seen to shine In the warm breast of Caroline. The Youth, to whom her heart she gave, Was noble, generous and brave; And that, which in return was given, She thought the precious boon of Heaven. Hymen was summon'd to adorn His Altar on the following morn, At that morn's dawning Henry 'woke, Expected joys his slumbers broke: He saunter'd forth to catch the breeze That curl'd the bosom of the seas, And while he pac'd along the shore, Counting his future pleasures o'er, He saw a shallop foundering nigh; He heard Despair's alarming cry, And boldly plunging in the wave, The sinking Mariner to save, He found himself a wat'ry grave. —The tidings to the Bride were brought, In frantic haste the spot she sought; And viewing, from the heights above, All that remain'd for her to love, She darted headlong to the tide, And on her Henry's bosom died. Their tomb is rais'd upon the shore, And round its base the billows roar: There oft the Seaman slacks the sail, And to the Stranger tells the tale. Champagne, Sherry, and Water Gruel. “TWO aged men, but of what sort, 'Tis not material to report: Suffice it, as the story's told, They both were very, very old, And had attain'd to full fourscore, Though I have heard, 'twas somewhat more. Their cheeks with ruddy colour glow'd, Their hoary locks in ringlets flow'd, And such their strength and sprightly air, That strangers who had view'd the pair, Would have suppos'd they could not boast Of more than sixty years at most. —On being ask'd what means they took To cheat age of its wither'd look, The one, in grave and solemn pride To the Enquirer thus replied.” “Through the long course that I have run, This maxim I've pursu'd,—to shun Intemperance, and all its brood Of vices that inflame the blood; Or check its current through the veins, Engend'ring endless aches and pains. I never, like an hungry beast, O'ercharg'd my stomach at a feast; Nor, by a glutton maw misled, With season'd meats the juices fed, Forming gross humours which, by stealth, Prey on the vital source of Health. I never pass'd the feverish nights With Bacchus, and his madd'ning rites; Ne'er lost my Reason, gift divine, In bowls of riot-stirring wine; Nay, I can boast, I ne'er was found Drunken, and senseless on the ground: Ne'er did I sober hours pollute, By turning man into a brute. My Beverage, let the Drunkard sneer,— Was sought from rill and fountain clear. Hence equal spirits cheer'd the day, With calm, but yet, enliv'ning ray; Nor do wild Fancy's dreams affright The tranquil slumbers of the night. Ne'er sought I sensual Pleasure's bower, To waste and dissipate the hour: Nor did I in those scenes engage, Which shorten youth and hasten age. Hence I see, and who will doubt me, My children all grow old about me; Who, having liv'd by my sage rule, Do credit to their Father's school. Thus, fearless of the world to come, Time will conduct me to the Tomb; And for the years that yet remain, If sorrow they should bring, and pain, I still shall bless th'Almighty power, Whose goodness rules Life's every hour, To his decrees submissive bend, And patient wait my Journey's end.” He ceas'd, and having told his tale, Approving smiles around prevail. —The other then was ask'd to tell What He had done, to look so well: To bear his age with such a grace, And scarce a wrinkle on his face. He, with a smile sarcastic spoke, As half in earnest—half in joke. “Through the long course that I have run, My maxim always was to shun, Whate'er I thought a foe to fun. I was a young, unlucky Dog, But honest, and ne'er play'd the rogue: All kinds of Gambols I preferr'd, But then I never broke my word; And I can say, in looking o'er My life, from twenty to fourscore, It was the burden of my song, Never to do my neigbour wrong; And, 'twas my practice and delight, Always to do my neighbour right. So far, so good; and for the rest, Why—I did that which pleas'd me best. —I never did my thirst controul When I beheld the flowing bowl; Nor was it known that Thomas Hearty When join'd with any jovial party: E'er felt a melancholy shock To hear the cry “past four o'clock,” Unless he felt it as a warning Of the dull period of the morning, When Phœbus, in his gilded cart, Would shortly bid them all depart. I, through my Life, a jolly fellow, Scarce went to bed but I was mellow; And I'd a head, a gift divine, That never felt an ache from wine: Nor did my stomach play the trick, However fill'd, of being sick: Nor was my reason ever lost So as to run against a post; Nor could my Cups my senses smother, That I took one door for another. Besides my wife, if she were here, But she has reach'd a better sphere, Would say that, though her Tom might roam, He always brought good humour home:— For though I sometimes chang'd the feast, I always lov'd my Dolly best: New Beauties might a flame impart, But she alone possest my heart. —I ne'er to wine was a Defaulter, And therefore never call'd for water, That meager, mawkish, tasteless thing, From running rill and chrystal spring. O 'tis a beverage, I must think Fit but for Fish and Beasts to drink. —Nay, when my dearest Partner died, And I sat sadly down and cried, I almost turn'd my sobs to laughter To think my tears were made of water. Besides, I have my children four, Who now are verging to threescore: They all partake their father's joys; I crack my bottle with my boys. —My daughter has reach'd fifty-five, The very best Old Maid alive: Who, though a beauty, ne'er could find A Husband suited to her mind. O how I like my Moll to see Dropping the good thing in her tea; Nay, I could hug and kiss the Lass, When she says “Sir, another glass.” I think I should with pleasure throttle To hear her say, “another bottle.” Whatever time I'm doom'd to last, O may it all be like the past: And till I reach my latter end, Enjoy my bottle and my friend, As it has been my constant song, Never to do my neighbour wrong; As it has been my fond delight, Ever to do my neighbour right, I need not surely be afraid, When Death shall call me to the shade. But if, at length, before I go, The Powers above will have it so, That I should feel the twinging gout, Bacchus shall try to drive it out: Though if the Foe's resolv'd to stay, I'll calmly let him have his way; And if the Doctors breed a riot With draught and pill—I'll scorn their diet; I'll take my glass,—and die in quiet.” Such was Tom Champagne's pleasant tale, Nor did the boozing mortal fail To toast the man who loves his friend, And fills his bumpers to the end; Nor e'er will quit the running spout, Till his Life's ruby cask is out: Then, turning to his comely Dame, He bid the Lady do the same— “Here by my side is neighbour Sherry, Who never sorry is, or merry; Who on a chicken wing can dine, Content with thimble-fulls of wine. He talks, and chuckles as he speaks Of mad Intemp'rance and its freaks: But faith, I laugh at all his prosing A Life like his is only dosing: He only can be said to wake Who freely does his bumper take. Ned hints a smile, but if he'd quaff The jovial bowl, he'd learn to laugh: Did he regale on ham and chine, He'd have a shape as round as mine:— His fatten'd cheeks like mine would glow, Where wrinkles are not seen to grow; But he pursues his mawkish dream, And looks for fat in curds and cream. —Nay, there's Sir Jemmy in the corner, But not like sing-song Jacky Horner, Feeding on beef and Christmas pie, But lapping up his Firmity: He's one of those, as I've heard tell, Who think it vulgar to be well, And deem it elegance to sit, Vap'ring in melancholy fit. He suffers life to run to waste In what your fine-bred folks call taste; So smooth, so polish'd, so refin'd, That the firm energy of mind, Which ought to be our mortal boast, Is in the soft embroid'ry lost; And then each gawdy whim is seen Through the transparent Fillagreen; While his pure, sentimental flame Relaxes the whole nervous frame, And shows him to the passing eye, A poor, weak, flutt'ring butterfly. Sago, Panada, and the doses Which the Physician's pen composes, Is the Chevalier's daily theme; And, I presume, his nightly dream. All this is bad, but, what is worse, He turns his Cook into a Nurse; And watches her the morning long Lest she should make the broth too strong. 'Tis true, I sometimes steer this way To give his sinking spirits play: To cheer his heart with friendly Joke, And make his wintry chimnies smoke; To set his wond'ring pots a boiling, And keep his brisk Champagne from spoiling. —I've not, my friend, forgot the time, When you and I were in our prime: 'Twas when we both had just left college, Though you, I own, had all the knowledge; But then you let loose your caprices, And with your Sisters and your Nieces Humdrumm'd away your fine-spun Life, For you ne'er stumbled on a wife; And though you were so good, 'tis certain, You could play tricks behind the curtain. Come then, throw off your cap and gown, And let some maiden rub you down. Restore, I pray, each woe-worn feature, And be again a human creature. Change to good fare your starving diet: Kick up a dust and breed a riot. Be not so sad, nor shake your head; And keep those looks till you are dead.” “Thou jovial, noisy, pleasant wight,” Replied th'exhilarated Knight, “You never will your fancy balk, Whenever you've the itch to talk; Nor ever were you known to pass In silence, your too frequent glass: But well I know thy friendly heart, How gen'rous, how devoid of art! And though you rather stun my ears, Your humour still my spirits cheers. While you the plenteous goblets quaff, And at my whims and fancies laugh, I know full well you cannot steel Your breast, against the pains I feel: And much I wish your Life my Friend, May not to draughts and doses tend: For many a one may laugh to see Tom melted down as thin as me. E'er a few fleeting years are past, He may to slip-slops come at last. That you have laugh'd at me is true; 'Tis what you've long been us'd to do; But younger folks may laugh at you.” “You may believe, my good Sir James, I'll sooner plunge me in the Thames, Than be like you Mortis Imago, And think it life to live on Sago. When Nature burns out all my fuel And pins me down to water-gruel, I'll call on Death to intervene, And close at once the Milksop scene. Thus in sarcastic tone he spoke, And as he schem'd another Joke, The Spectre from the corner creeps, And o'er the sick man's shoulder peeps. Tom felt surpris'd, then gap'd and star'd, But his stout spirits were not scar'd: Nor did he e'er for mercy crave, When two full bottles made him brave. Thus in his view the Figure stood That cannot boast of flesh and blood. “I see,” says Tom, “you've got a glass, But I'll not let the bottle pass: Turn out the sand, and let me fill in, A Nectar that is worth the swilling.” —Death grinn'd a smile, and shook his head, And stretch'd his fleshless arm and said:— “Know, that I'm now dispos'd to feel A longing for a meagre meal; And He on whom I've laid my paw, Is the next morsel for my maw: But I shall surely leave you quiet, Till I'm in search of fatter diet. 'Tis true, you Topers sometimes stay, When sober folks are caught away; But Temp'rance is, as you should know, To Health a Friend, to Pain a Foe; That Virtue forms a fav'rite rule Which Wisdom teaches in her School; And Master Sherry, who sits there, Nor smiles with joy, nor frowns with care, Will dance with me, in easy pace, Long after you have run your race. —Sir James was well, but not content, To ev'ry learned Doctor went To make him better; and you see His picture of Mortality. —As life is ever running fast, And I must have you all at last, I'll tell you, and I'll tell you true, What 'tis you mortals ought to do. If you to Life's remotest date, Would keep my visit from your gate; —Extremes endeavour to forego— Nor feed too high,—nor feed too low: A medium I would recommend 'Tween Tom and his departed Friend.” The Nursery. ASK Nature when her powers impart The strongest impulse to the Heart? When she the fondest passion moves, And the most heighten'd feeling proves? —Ask when the first of joys appears, Though often shar'd with tort'ring fears? It is not when she gives the grace Of Beauty to the living face, Or bids the form, with plastic art, To harmonise in ev'ry part; 'Tis not when she the mind prepares For Reason's power and growing cares, Or watches the progressive plan Of Life, through ev'ry stage of man. —If she should answer, she would tell, What she well knows, and feels so well:— 'Tis when she gives to be caress'd An Infant to the mother's breast; 'Tis in that feeling where excess, Howe'er enjoy'd, is happiness. In all the forms that Nature gives To ev'ry work of her's that lives, Whether in fashion weak, or strong, That to the air brings forth its young, Affection's first great Law applies, To nurse their various progenies. —The Tigress tender fondness owns, And the whelps hear her soften'd tones: The fell Hyena gentle grows, As she the liquid food bestows On her young cubs; and, o'er the brood, Almost forgets the scent of blood. Thus while the soft, maternal flame, Is seen the wildest brute to tame; It wakes the tim'rous fowl to dare The fury of unequal war: She seeks the foe with ruffled plumes, And a fierce, threat'ning mien assumes; Which, when a Mother's cares are o'er, The coward Bird assumes no more.— As her alarm'd uplifted eye Beholds the mischief in the sky; When, sailing through his airy way, The Kite is watching for his prey; She spreads her wings to guard her young, And clucks the Danger with her tongue: While ev'ry bird that flies at large Instructs us in a parent's charge. Can then the woman e'er be found, By the first Laws of Nature bound, Who dares, in careless mood disclaim The nursing Mother's tender name? Say, in the breast that yields the tide, Which fost'ring Nature's springs provide, The suckling's nurture to supply, Will she by art the channels dry; And let the new-born babe be thrown Upon a bosom not her own? 'Tis even so:—such Mothers live Who to their Infants do not give The Milk that Nature's self prepares; Whose stream their children claim as Heirs, And Heaven's all-sacred Laws ordain The new-born Cherub to sustain. Yes, there are Mothers—yes, who dare, Soon as it breathes the vital air, While it unfolds its opening charms, To yield it to a stranger's arms; And let the helpless babe be press'd, Unconscious to a stranger's breast. —Does not a chilly stream impart Its shudder to the feeling heart? Does not the mind disgusted turn When the tale's told, and frowning spurn Th'unnatural mother, when she tears From her full paps the Child she bears? While thus to chance the bantling's hurl'd, She gives her fondness to the world; And, as she haunts where Pleasure reigns, Forgets she felt a Mother's pains. —Haste, haste, Dorinda, from the throng, Quit the gay dance and warbling song; You're call'd, with pale and trembling mien, To view a sad, heart-rending scene: —Haste to thy Infant, and prepare To view the Horrors of thy Care: The foster-mother feels no more, Than its own parent felt before: Drown'd in inebriated sleep, No vigils can the Drunkard keep. —Death rocks the Cradle, as you see, And sings his mortal Lullaby. No shrieks, no cries will now its slumbers break; The Infant sleeps,—ah, never to awake! The Astronomer. HE, who with care and much ado, Has chang'd one blade of grass to two; He, who an acre too has plough'd, And with good seed that acre sow'd; He, who to the Earth has given A Tree, to rear its boughs to Heaven, And, with a chaste and loving wife, Gives but a single babe to life: Has, as 'tis said, by one whose name Stands foremost on the roll of Fame, Perform'd, in philosophic view, All that a Man's requir'd to do: This done, each social claim is paid; And when in Earth his bones are laid, The sculptor'd stone may truly tell That he has liv'd and acted well. But what says Science to the Rule Thus taught in simple Nature's school: That Science which pursues her way, Through gloomy night, or glaring day, Creation's ev'ry work explores; Digs deep for all the hidden stores Which the Earth's darksome caves contain, And dives within the wat'ry main; Expatiates through the fields of air, And sees the storms engender'd there; Or boldly bids her daring eye Explore the wonders of the sky;— While Genius, to no spot confin'd, That brightest offspring of the mind, Ranges at will, through Space and Time, In ev'ry age, in every clime; And, oft its glorious toil to crown, Creates new Systems of its own. —Such are the classes that embrace Man's social, cultivated Race: And, as each acts the part assign'd, It helps, in due degree, to bind, By harmonising, just controul, The gen'ral order of the whole. Now Master Senex, who was bred To guide into the youthful head, Not that poor Two and Two make Four, Or that three Twenties form Threescore; But the nice, calculating play Of Decimals and Algebra; With Problems and the curious store That's found in Mathematic Lore. He always felt himself at home When 'mong the Stars he chose to roam. And, for a frisk, would sometimes stray Delighted in the Milky Way. Would bask in the Meridian Noon, And clamber Mountains in the Moon. He would the Comet's course pursue, And tell, with calculation due, How many million miles it posted, While a small Leg of Mutton roasted. And how many a thousand years Will pass before it re-appears. —He never for one moment thought But of the Sciences he taught: Him never did the Fancy seize Of ploughing land, or planting trees; Nor was the sober Sage beguil'd To be the Father of a Child. A Sister, an old saving Elf, Who was as barren as himself, Added a figure to the scene, And dress'd his meat, and kept him clean. One Evening, as he view'd the sky, Through his best tube, with curious eye, And 'mid the azure wilds of air, Pursu'd the progress of a Star, A Figure seem'd to intervene, Which in the sky he ne'er had seen; But thought it some new planet given, To dignify his views of Heaven. “O this will be a precious boon! Herschell's Volcanos in the Moon, Are nought to this,” Old Senex said; “My Fortune is for ever made.” —“It is, indeed,” a voice replied: The Old Man heard it—terrified; And, as Fear threw him to the ground, Through the long tube Death gave the wound. Though Senex died no thunder roll'd, No lightning flash'd, no tempests growl'd: Nor did the Pleiades descend, In rain, to weep their faithful friend: Nor would the Moon in sorrow shroud Her silver light within a cloud: Nay, not a single sigh was given By any Star that shines in Heaven. The Father of the Family. AT Bristol, as the Story's told, Or in some other place as old, The Healing Doctors, when they strive In vain to keep sick folks alive, Are, by the common Custom led To pay their duties to the Dead: The Patients whom they cannot save, They always usher to the grave, Nor quit at once, the friends who fee'd 'em, But to their long last home precede 'em; Bearing, if still the traffic thrives, Silk scarfs, and hatbands, to their wives, To whom these presents come so pat To make a bonnet, or a hat; While half a dozen put together, May form a gown for wintry weather: Or serve an œconomic turn, If they should have a cause to mourn: Nay if the Dead Man's rich, d'ye see, They get a ring that's worth a fee. Thus, though they neither sigh nor grieve, It is genteely taking leave: Besides, 'tis right to set before us, Whate'er is decent and decorous. I cannot say I like the Galen, Who, when he finds his Physic failing, Nor can restore, with all his art, The vital pulses of the Heart, Walks off, and feels no other sorrow, But for the Fee, he'll miss to-morrow. —I lately read a curious tale, Where Truth and Fancy both prevail, But few will their assent refuse To this effusion of the Muse. Eugenio was the best of men, I wish there were one such in ten; Nay, 'twould improve the human brood, If a tenth part were half as good. So many virtues, and so rare, Did his benignant bosom share, That, if Man could perfection know, It shone in my Eugenio. He was his parent's darling joy, A lovely, tender, duteous Boy: From day to day, from year to year, Along the gradual career, From Youth's gay season to the prime Of Manhood, through that doubtful time, He ne'er disturb'd a Mother's rest, Nor pain'd a watchful Father's breast. —His wedded Love a blessing prov'd, To her whom he most fondly lov'd; And after twenty years were past, The well-known Flitch was claim'd at last. —Nor did his virtues less proclaim The Honour of a Parent's name: He watch'd, with never-ceasing eye, O'er his lov'd, num'rous progeny, Who form'd a regulated stage, From infant years to youthful age; And promis'd all that's good and fair, Beneath his never-ceasing care. His Friendships were to few confin'd, And they were of the noblest kind: But in warm Charity's embrace, His Nature clasp'd the human race. Whene'er Old England ask'd his aid, Each claim of Loyalty was paid: The manly flame, the patriot zeal, His bosom never ceas'd to feel; Nor e'er did Misery complain, Or ask his helping hand in vain. —Learning he lov'd, but never sought Delusive Science, that is taught By false and by fantastic rule In Fancy's bower or Sceptic School; He, from the purest fountains, drew The knowledge which the wise pursue; Profound and useful and refin'd, To gild and to instruct the mind. While fair Religion's sacred Lore, Sanctified the varied store. —Such was Eugenio:—If to these Are join'd the wish and power to please, Reflection's eye the whole may scan, Of this incomparable man. Wealth did his days with plenty crown, And wide Domains were all his own. —But he was not exempt from fate: The evils of our mortal state He felt like other men: Disease Did on his yielding vitals seize. The Fever rag'd, the Doctor came, But could not cool the fatal flame; He fear'd the worst, and ask'd the aid Of some learn'd brother of his trade: But the two Doctors both agreed, No mortal Med'cine could succeed; But still it would be well to try What further Counsels may supply:— A Third appears, and says no more Than what his Brethren said before. They saw Death in his pale array, So took their Fees and walk'd away. —Amid the tears, the sobs, the sighs, That round expiring virtue rise, The Tyrant stretch'd his arms well pleas'd, And soon th'expiring victim seiz'd. The Wife around her Husband clung, The Children on their Mother hung; And all that view'd the scene exprest The moanings of an aching breast. “Cease,” said Eugenio, “cease to grieve, “And these my parting words receive: “With patience bear the stroke that's given;— “Be good,—and leave the rest to Heaven. “O let not Sorrow heave a sigh, “When thus you see a christian die.” The Fall of Four in Hand. THE crime by which the Angels fell Who aim'd at Heaven and sunk to Hell, Is known on Earth—nor does it fail In human bosoms to prevail With the like Influence, and extends Its wish to Earth's remotest ends: Nay, if its fierce, subduing Sword, Like that of Macedonia's Lord, Should make th'affrighted world turn pale And many a nation weep and wail, Would weep itself, when all was won, For other realms to be undone. 'Tis strange, alas, 'tis wond'rous strange That mortal man should wish to change The heart-felt pleasures that await On Virtue's all ennobling state And risk his goodness to be great; Uncertain that he e'er shall gain The point he wishes to attain, Or if attain'd, that in an hour, Fate may not by its deadly power Destroy the labours of his pride, And lay him breathless by their side. The man to whom is handed down Through many an age the regal crown, And bears within his scepter'd hand The power a nation to command, Possesses, from his Royal Birth, The means to be a God on earth; Honour and Justice to maintain, By wise, protecting Laws to reign; To cherish Industry and Arts, And live within the grateful hearts Of subject millions, who can boast The Sov'reign in the Father lost. Is there on earth so bright a state As his on whom a people wait For ev'ry good that Life can give, And from his pow'r that good receive? What sounds so grateful to the ear Can a wise, patriot monarch hear, As when a Nation's voices raise The song of Universal praise? Thus may a Sov'reign truly prove Vice-gerent of the Power above. Say, is it Glory's nobler aim To win by War a Conqueror's name? And is it Honour's highest meed To make a Nation's bosom bleed; To mount Bellona's armed car, And plunge into the thickest war; Or is it for a people's good To seek for Laurels steep'd in blood? Is it the guerdon of the brave To murder, ransack, and enslave? A monarch gains not fair renown Nor gives true Lustre to his Throne, By seizing countries not his own. That Diadem's the brightest far Which bears no type of bloody war; But where sweet peace is seen to shed Its mild beams round the Sov'reign's head. But should some hostile Neighbours dare To force him to reluctant War; Should they with bold, ambitious aim Announce in arms the lawless claim; Or, tempted by the rich domains Where Fortune smiles and plenty reigns, Should pointed spears and plumed helms Invading threat his peaceful realms, He will assume his martial pride, With Courage stalking by his side: Then will he sound the loud alarms To call his faithful bands to arms; Each Peasant then will quit his field, Gird on his sword, and poise his shield; And ev'ry heart with ardor glow T'obey the call and meet the Foe: Then will he find no Bulwarks prove So strong, as is a Nation's Love. Thus as he ev'ry right defends, Just Heaven its fav'rite's cause befriends; Nor will the heroic contest cease, Till the Foe, humbled, sues for peace. Thus ev'ry passion of the mind, As 'tis to good or ill inclin'd, Advances or recedes in price, And forms a virtue or a vice: Nay, sometimes, as it yields its claim, Is even found to change its name. Thus the fervent, bold desire That does to arduous deeds aspire, Which, in its eager progress warm, Ne'er suffers dangers to alarm; With Fate and Fortune will contend, To gain some great, momentous end, Is call'd Ambition;—but applied To common things, that, on the tide Of ev'ry hour we floating see, 'Tis Love of Praise or Vanity: And these, howe'er conceal'd by art, Glow more or less in ev'ry heart; In ev'ry form and shape appear, That Folly or Caprice can wear. Look round, and view the various ways Mankind employ to purchase praise;— The fulsome Offering to secure, What will not Vanity endure: The sleepless night, the daily toil, The pale lamp and the midnight oil, Are borne or lighted up to gain The flatt'ring tale, th'applausive strain Which Int'rest offers to the vain. 'Tis not his darling Country's cause, Or Freedom's violated Laws; 'Tis not the poor who suffering stand, Scourg'd by Oppression's Iron Hand: 'Tis not the vengeance to arrest Which rankles in the angry breast: 'Tis not to check with words austere The cunning Lie, or taunting Jeer, That Paulo, of his talents proud, Seeks to address th'assembled croud; At Democratic Feasts to dine, And mingle Speeches with his wine, Or in the social circles play, The self-same game another way: No, 'tis to court the loud Huzza; To hear the plates and tables rattle, At his success in wordy battle; Or, sitting round the wintry fire, Where Witlings, and fair Dames admire. Thus have I seen a branchy tree Show its fair form and symmetry, That rises stately from the root; Though not a bough is deck'd with fruit. —But still some talents are required To make these Orators admir'd; And with the Hear-hims, common Pride May feel itself quite satisfied. But there are those, and often seen, Who feel a pride in being mean; And chuckle at the very thought How cheap a stinking Mack'rel's bought; While others, proud to be profuse, Buy costly Blacking for their Shoes, And give what ten poor folks would dine, To make their daily Buskins shine. —Now, of all those who proud of sinking, And of the Art of never thinking, Sam Jehu was, 'tis said, well known As the best Whip about the Town: His Father had been proud of thriving, But Sam was proud of nought but driving; And all his old Dad's Will bestow'd Was nobly spent upon the Road. Whate'er Long-Acre could devise Of Curricles and Tilburys; Barouches, Gigs, and Phaetons, With every Machine that runs, Form'd, in their turns, Sam's darling Pride, At once their Owner and their Guide. To-day he drove his matchless Greys, To-morrow, his fast-trotting Bays; And, in the way of common Hacks, He had a famous set of Blacks. He knew Horse Language to the Letter, Not Gulliver could speak it better: Could swear, drink drams, and chew a Quid, Proud to do all that Coachmen did, And calmly did his teeth displace, That he might spit with better grace; Delighted that no one could scan He had been bred a Gentleman. And as he drove his steeds along, This was the burden of his song: When House and Land are gone and spent, Driving will be most excellent: And when all other Fortunes fail, Thank Heaven, I can drive a Mail. But Fate, 'tis known vain Fools to humble, Will sometimes give such fools a tumble. Sam, one fine day, in all his pride, With a fair Doxy by his side, Was trotting on to leave behind The common coursers of the wind, In more than Phaetonic state, For every horse had won a Plate: Nay, out of compliment to Fan, He was dress'd like a Gentleman. Now, to avoid the Coachman's ken Or jeering Quiz of Turnpike-men, He left the common-road, afraid Thus to be seen in Masquerade. Through a long range of Lanes he went On the rough roads and ruts intent, Nor was Miss Fanny satisfied Thus to be jolted side from side; Though, to beguile the shaded way, She made her Hat with Hawthorns gay. At length Sam saw an awkward Bridge; Beside him was a stony ridge; And, in the rocky Vale below, A rapid stream was seen to flow: The hurrying Eddies hoarse resound; Th'affrighted Steeds snort, fling and bound, And threaten to refuse command, E'en from their skilful Master's hand. For the first time, the Charioteer Felt his heart palpitate with Fear. —He cried, what can the Cattle mean? And, as by no one I am seen, I do declare I should be glad That I a tight Postillion had, To check those Leaders, who are mad. “Thou hast thy Longing,” Death replied; “I'll quickly mount, and be your guide: The useless reins resign to me: I'll lead you to your Destiny.” —He spoke, when strait the wheels upflew, And from his seat the Coachman threw; Who rolling round, and round and round, Flounc'd in the water—and was drown'd. Poor screaming Fanny, in a tree, Was sav'd by dint of Drapery: She, for a while, suspended hung, And to the prickly branches clung. A Cottage gave a week's relief, To cure her scratches and her grief; And, when she came to Town agen, She sorrow'd—and turn'd Magdalen. But Vanity will oft extend Beyond our Life's extremest end, Will nod in many a sable plume, And flatter on the marble Tomb. Thus Sam had will'd in solemn guise, The order of his obsequies; And, punctual to his wishes, they Were marshall'd in this sad array. His gloves and whip, in due parade, Were on his sable coffin laid: The Coffin, on the traces slung Of his Barouche, suspended hung. His four unrivall'd Arab Greys, With trappings deck'd, his corse conveys: His fav'rite Coachman had the Pride To drive it to the Church-yard side; And, having done that duty, swore He ne'er would mount a Coach-box more. The Parson who before him rode, Was left the Mare which he bestrode. His Horses, in black cloathing led, Add to the Honours of the dead: His Grooms conduct them, clad in sables, With the young Genii of the Stables; Who, having sung a solemn stave, Throw all their Whips into the Grave. Gaffer Goodman. LIFE is oft liken'd to the Stage, That equal Glass of ev'ry age, Where its true characters are shown To each attentive Looker-on: Where gay and grave, and old and young, Their story tell in prose or song. There varying passion plays its part, And ev'ry tell-tale of the Heart Does, to the list'ning ear, expose The warm delights, the chilling woes, That in the human bosom reign, And form the source of Joy and Pain. —But be it known, we do not mean To enter on the Tragic scene, Where Warriors or where Kings rehearse In solemn strains and pompous verse, The Battle's glory or the fate That marks the contest of the great; Or where advent'rous Champions prove The ardour of Heroic Love. Nor do we look to that strange creature, Which has no Prototype in Nature; That feeds on Fashion, and appears To live by nailing down the Ears: A flimsy, gay, fantastic show Deck'd out in gawdy Furbelow Yclep'd an Opera:—No, we sport Where Nature and her train resort, And the gay Comic Muse pourtrays The common scenes of common days; Where we the mirthful bev'rage quaff, And still grow better while we laugh. Here nat'ral failings are disclos'd, And bold infirmities exposed; While Virtue, steer'd by Reason's Card, Attains its merited reward. Humour's broad Phrase, its poignant stroke, The moral point, the homely joke, By strong and happy contrast tend The mind to cheer, the heart to mend: While in the progress of the scene Th'unlook'd for projects intervene; And should all other Fancies fail, Hymen or Death may close the tale. Nay, sometimes, as I have seen, forsooth, The well-drawn story ends in both. Old Gaffer Goodman, who had spent His days among the wealds of Kent, A Yeoman hearty, bold and free Had gain'd the age of seventy-three; And, as some other fools have done. Married a Girl of twenty-one. A Nurse he wanted, and he chose A Maid whose cheeks were like the rose. And with an azure sleepy eye That mark the tender Sympathy, Which could not find a counterpart In Gaffer Goodman's shrivell'd heart. He felt the Sacrifice she made, Which, to his utmost he repaid. Fair Sally's Family were poor, But now they shar'd her Husband's store, On ev'ry Sunday, in a Pew, Sally dress'd out appear'd to view; And as she smiling pass'd along Was honour'd by the rustic Throng: For in the Parish it was said That the Old Man his will had made, And left her, as it would appear, At least three hundred pounds a year: With all his cattle and his flocks, And store of Gold in Iron Box, Which he most strictly watch'd and kept Beneath the Bed whereon he slept. Besides, at Village-fair on May-day, She gave a Prize and play'd the Lady, While the Old Man was pleas'd to share The honour which was shewn her there. But though Dame Nature daily told That she was young, and he was old, And bid her in the mirror true Her own enchanting image view; Yet howe'er conscious of her beauty, She acted each domestic duty; Nor ever wish'd abroad to roam, But nurs'd her Hub, and staid at home. With her fair hand so smooth and sleek, She'd stroke his brow and pat his cheek; And, when the household cares were done, Would read some story full of Fun, Make his fat sides with laughter shake, And keep his drowsy eyes awake; Or, while she spun, his heart would cheer, With any song he wish'd to hear. But still, with all her sense and truth, Spite of herself, the tender Youth, Whose humble virtues had possest The wishes of her youthful breast, E'er wealth or an awaken'd pride, Had made her Gaffer Goodman's bride, Would sometimes on her fancy steal, And what she wish'd to hide—reveal. Nay, at the window as she sat, He would propose his friendly chat; And, as the whirring wheel went round, Old Gaffer only heard the sound, Whose noise the tender converse drown'd. She heard fond Strephon with delight, But still she did not think it right; And when he tun'd a Shepherd's song, She listen'd, but she thought it wrong. He brought her ribbons from the Fair, She took them, but she would not wear The blushing gift. At length, she said, “No, Strephon, though you may upbraid, And think I was a faithless Maid, Let Reason sway and Passion cool, You'll think I must have been a fool, Had I preferr'd to live with thee In Labour, Love, and Poverty: In Love that might so soon be past, And Labour that through Life would last. I've done the best, though somewhat loth, If you are prudent, for us both. While Gaffer Goodman lives, I'll be A Pattern of Fidelity; So dare no more the tale to tell, Which once, perhaps, I lik'd too well. —My parents now in comfort live, I give them all I wish to give: My Mother, she is near threescore; My Father, he is somewhat more:— That they from want, and toil are free, I owe to Gaffer's Love for me. —I've heard too much, I'll hear no more:— So give this talk and sing-song o'er; Nor ever offer to my ear What my Old Man ought not to hear: —Be prudent, with due patience wait, And trust me for your future fate. 'Tis more than I ought to impart, But 'tis to ease your honest heart, When I declare that I'll be true To Gaffer Goodman, and to you: And when he does his breath resign, Be wise—and, Strephon, I'll be thine.” —“Then take her, Strephon,” Death replied, Who smoking sat by Goodman's side: “Her Husband's gone, as you may see, “For his last Pipe he smok'd with me.” Though a rich Widow and a Beauty, Sally perform'd the usual duty. Though many a wealthy Yeoman su'd And a brisk, Country Justice woo'd, Twelve months she pass'd in grateful pride, E'er she her mourning laid aside: But when at length the time was come That she could take a Husband home, Sally her early choice preferr'd, And with her Strephon kept her word. The Urchin Robbers. NO Fault appears to be more common In Reason, or of man or woman, Than to apply it, as seems best, To what is thought their Interest, Leaving the more enlighten'd few Its native dictates to pursue. —The Lawyer never will say fie on't, To aught that furnishes a Client; —The Broker judges of events By their effect on three per Cents.; With him the glory of the Nation Is that which fits his Calculation; And, as he is a Bull or Bear, Will pray for Peace, or wish for War. —The Politician's never hearty But for the Interest of his Party; And ever zealous to foment The cry of public discontent, He prays that all in power be driven Out of their ministerial Heaven. And he has Reason on his side Such as it may be, for his pride Or wants may then be satisfied: As by such change he may insure A Place, a Name, or Sinecure. Nor is there to be found the man, Thriving by money-getting Plan Who does not to one reason hold, A reason that is made of Gold. Fancy will sometimes take the lead And play its part in Reason's stead. —The Virtuoso is profound In all the wonders that abound Through Nature's realms, with all the store She yields to him who dare explore The mountain's top, the secret cave, Or shores lash'd by the briny wave, For what is beautiful or rare That she has lodg'd or planted there. He reasons on the wond'rous power That, from Creation's awful hour, Has teem'd in never-ceasing birth, As if to renovate the Earth With fresh materials, to maintain, From Time's wide waste, old Nature's reign. Then in bold, pompous language wields The Doctrines which each System yields That sage Philosophers have shewn;— And closes boldly with his own. Nature's first works, he says, are met Within his costly Cabinet;— Then opes a Drawer, and slowly shows His Shells, arrang'd in various rows; And disappoints th'expecting eyes With Insects, and with Butterflies. Cælia was by her Father told To take a Husband rich and old, When Cælia's secret wishes lay, As it fell out, another way. A country Squire, in glowing youth, Promis'd Fidelity and Truth, With a fair rent-roll that was clear At least twelve hundred pounds a year, And all the joys that suit a wife Contented with a rural Life. Cælia receiv'd his am'rous tale Nor thought the vows she gave could fail. Now every night she fondly dreams Of shady groves and chrystal streams; Nor to her friends will ever own That she e'er wish'd to live in Town. But he had not attain'd the age Which gave him up his Heritage; Three months must pass to leave him free From Guardian's care and Custody; And then 'twas hop'd Papa would crown His wish to make the Fair his own. —In the mean time, for so it prov'd, Sir Edward saw the Fair and lov'd; When she receiv'd Papa's command To give her heart and yield her hand. She felt what tender maidens feel, Nor could at first her sighs conceal; As sudden disappointment crept About her heart, she sometimes wept. —But, in due time, sage Reason came And help'd to quench the wav'ring flame; For soon she too herself confess'd Papa must know what's for the best. A coach and six and liv'ried train, With mansion fair and large domain; A fine Town-house in some fine Square, With all the pride of Fashion there Would a more solid blessing prove, Than in the woods to live on Love. Cynthio is good, but he's so young, And youthful passion ne'er lasts long. She reason'd thus, and set at rest The faint punctilio in her breast. To Cynthio then she wrote to say, Papa commands, I must obey; —To-morrow is my Wedding Day. But Int'rest still its office finds In vulgar, as in higher minds; When Discontent its tale will tell In the same way, though not so well. Thus Wat, the Gard'ner, thought it hard His toil should fail of its reward: When east-winds blew and blossoms blasted, That all his labour should be wasted; When in the space of one short night His hopes should sicken at a blight: For though he knew he must supply Deserts with Garden Luxury, And that my Lord would curse and swear, Did he not find abundance there; Wat would contrive, a cunning elf, To smuggle something for himself: The finest fruit he would purloin, With, now and then, a swinging pine; Plumbs, peaches, apricots, and all That grew in hot-house, or on wall; And would the secret Cargo send, To some good Covent-Garden friend. Nor did his Conscience give a twitch At robberies that made him rich; But when the unlucky Urchins dare Mount o'er the wall and seize a share, His rigid virtue was alarm'd, And, at one morning's dawn well-arm'd, He watch'd, and when the robbers came Let loose the Dog, and took his aim. No sooner had his Musquet popp'd, Than from the Wall a youngster dropp'd. “O Heavens,” he cried, “what have I done? “I only meant a little fun: “I only wish'd to wake their fears “By rattling shot about their ears, “And scare them, that they might refrain “From ever coming here again. “I should be worse than any brute “To kill a boy for stealing fruit; “Besides, what Fate should I receive, “If all were to be shot who thieve. “Death is the worst of all our foes; “His stroke no mortal can oppose. “'Twas he, not I, the Urchin slew: “What mischief has he made me do! “Old Wat,” said Death, “tis very true. For while the Gard'ner took his aim, Death stood beside the Melon frame, And thus at once, alarm'd and cheer'd The trembling Man with what He hear'd. “I drove the Boy to scale the wall, “I made the affrighted Robber fall; “I plac'd beneath the pointed stone “That he has crack'd his scull upon. “I've been his best and guardian Friend, “And sav'd him from a Felon's end: “Scourging and Lectures have been vain; “The Rascal was a rogue in grain, “And, had I lengthen'd out his date “The Gallows would have been his Fate. “You living people oft mistake me:— “I'm not so cruel as you make me. “And now restrain your love of Pelf; “Pray look a little to yourself. “Virtue alone can joy impart, “For Guilt ne'er knows a joy at heart; “And He, by all it is confest, “Who looks alone to Interest, “As you, Old Wat, must know, I trust, “Is hastening fast to be unjust; “Or to employ a term in vogue, “Now is, or soon will be a rogue. “—The Boy is freed from worldly pain, “He'll ne'er climb walls or rob again: “A dozen plumbs form'd all his treason, “While you are robbing through the season. “Something far worse than Gun or Shot, “If you proceed, may be your Lot: “So leave off thieving, Master Walter,— “Or I may come, and bring a Halter.” Death turned Pilot. AMONG the Cares by which the breast Of anxious mortals is opprest, Are the prophetic doubts that wait Upon their childrens' future fate. Swath'd in the cradle, they sustain The troubles which they can't explain; And, when escap'd from Infancy Their growing childhood is not free From num'rous evils that attend Life's passage onward to its end. What pains and anguish might we name That daily threat the human Frame! What various casualties await Life's active or inactive state! What diff'rent forms Disease assumes, And to what ills our Nature dooms! Sometimes with a swift-winged power, It hurries to the fatal hour; Or, with slow, undermining art, Stills, by degrees, the beating heart. Then comes frail Youth's incautious hour, And Passion's overwhelming power, To fill with tears a parent's eye Or wring his heart with agony:— When no grave counsels will controul Th'impetuous sallies of the soul; When no kind warnings will impart Discretion to the erring heart; When fond Affection big with Fear, Foreboding some dark peril near, May call on Death to strike, and save The Stripling in the sheltering Grave. —But should the genial Offspring rise To bless an anxious Parent's eyes, While in the growing form they trace The female charm or manly grace, And view each opening virtue shine That makes a mortal half divine; If Death should point his fatal dart At such a much-lov'd victim's heart, How great would be the Father's woe, What bitter, ceaseless tears would flow Adown the Mother's cheek, while sighs Speak the rent bosom's agonies. But still some comfort waits the doom Of those we follow to the tomb: With awe and solemn step we tread The sacred mansion of the Dead; And see the holy honours paid When, 'neath the marble they are laid, Who were our heart's delight and pride, And never griev'd us till they died. E'en while th'afflicted spirits mourn, And faithful fondness clasps the urn That marks the spot where Friendship lies, Or Love demands our Obsequies, We can with less'ning grief declare, The dust of those we lov'd is there. While the Cypress shade we weave, The sooth'd affections cease to grieve; And when we thus our thoughts employ, Sorrow becomes a solemn Joy. But we've to tell another tale:— O'er the wide Ocean doom'd to sail, Two Maidens fair, in early bloom Found in the deep a wat'ry tomb. In India born, a parent's cares Had sent them in their earliest years, To pass, beneath a milder clime, That doubtful, but important time Of Female Life, which intervenes Between its Childhood and the Teens. Submitted to a Guardian's power, Who, as the sun brings forth the flower, Watch'd his young Indians to improve With feelings like a Father's love. He, to th'important duty just, Fulfill'd with care the sacred Trust; And taught their early minds to glow With all a Female ought to know. The voice was tun'd to aid the Lyre, Each Grace did with the Muse conspire, And their respective powers combin'd T'exalt the form and deck the mind; While all the Virtues play'd their part, And took possession of the Heart. Thus the fair infant plants, the boast Of Coromandel's distant coast, Foster'd beneath the genial skies That Britain's happy Isle supplies, Grew tall and stately to the sight, In every youthful colour bright; Nor did the Pride of Western Bowers Excel these Eastern Sister Flowers. At length, the fruits of Friendship's toil Were summon'd to their native soil, Prepar'd with every winning grace To meet a parent's fond embrace, Whose hopes were fix'd that they should find The lovely form, the cultur'd mind; And when again, in all their charms, The full-grown maids should fill their arms; With feelings rich in ecstasy, They should the Infant Cherubs see, Transform'd by Time and faithful Care, A mortal Angel's shape to wear. To Albion's shores they bade adieu; The white Cliffs lessen in their view; And all was Hope, and all was gay, As they pursu'd their wat'ry way. —But—e'er one fleeting moon was past, With clouds the sky was overcast: With fearful force the tempest blows, And wave on wave tumultuous flows: The Sun, as he descends to rest, Just marks with red the dusky West, Till into darkness he declines, And the whole Heaven to Night resigns:— No ray of light is seen around, The Moon and Stars in shade are drown'd;— Thus Time, in its most dreadful Form, Augments the horrors of the Storm. As the rude, swelling surges roll, No Power the Vessel can controul; She now defies the Steersman's skill, And through the billows drives at will; The Keel no longer can abide The floods that lash her weary side, And gaping planks no longer brave The force of the resistless wave. —The Sisters, 'mid these dire alarms, Were fainting in each other's arms; Or with loud lamentable cries Told their heart-rending agonies. —The toils of the alarming hour The Crews exhausted strength o'er-power. Some on the shrouds, before, behind, Mount, as it were into the wind; Some, clinging to the mast in vain Are thrown into the yawning main; Others in haste the boat prepare, The last faint hope in their despair; When, from the sinking vessel borne, Through the fierce billows, all forlorn They see Death sitting at the Helm; And, as the mountain seas o'erwhelm, Amid the Storm's tremendous roar, One shriek they give—and all is o'er. The Sailor's form'd the storm to brave, And calls the Sea the Seaman's grave: But Beauty sure might hope to sleep Where Graces mourn, and Muses weep; And claim, to deck its mournful bier, The fond lament, the flowing tear. —Ill-fated pair, you find a grave Far, far beneath the Stormy Wave, And the loud winds, in boistrous swell, O'er the deep waters sound your Knell. The winding up of the Clock. TIME has been call'd the Thief of Youth, And so it may with moral Truth: But 'tis alike the Thief of Age, And jogs us on from Stage to Stage: As in its course it passes on, It steals a bit from ev'ry one: Leaving each still the less behind, T'improve his fortune or his mind. To chronicle Time's ample space, We years and centuries embrace: The hours and minutes, as they pass, Are told by Dial, Clock or Glass; But, measuring Time, ah! thoughtless elves, Know that ye measure but yourselves. The Clock that faithful strikes the Hour, Has struck that period from your power: Its hand that runs the wonted distance Runs o'er so much of your existence. A Clock then is a wise invention That answers a two-fold Intention: It calls us off from idle pleasures, For Life and Time at once it measures. John Dunn had one; but first of John, 'Tis fit some little should be known:— For he was once a rosy Youth Who came from the Swale side, In Town to serve his 'prenticeship— Of 'Prentices the Pride. For strict and regular was he, More punctual there were none: To ev'ry one he gave his due, But ne'er forgot his own. His Master's Daughter, Judy fair, He view'd with eyes askance, For John had still the Yorkshire nack Of minding the main Chance. And lest the Father, rich and stern, The union should prevent; To tie the sacred Knot by stealth He gain'd the Maid's consent. John's seven years service at an end, The marriage is avow'd. When Dad consents, what can't be chang'd, Were full as well allow'd. Of a bad bargain make the best Had been his maxim ever: Whom God and John's good care had join'd He knew no man could sever. For the young pair he takes a house, And Furniture provides; Beds, tables, chairs, an eight-day Clock, And some few things besides. Within the sound of great Bow Bell, And with the Church in view. John still prefers his own dear Clock— It gave the time so true. As other Clocks are wont to do, It struck but once an hour; And often he had cause to wish Ma'am's Clock would strike no more. For she, but women all have tongues, And, therefore, let's not flout 'em, What Nature gave, if they mayn't use, They were as well without 'em. So thought good Mrs. Dunn, and oft Let Mr. Dunn to know, Since he'd become so rich and great, Who 'twas that made him so. Man is, 'tis said, a social creature, And must companions find; In things of brute and lifeless nature, When others prove unkind. Thus when John Dunn, of his Wife's tongue Too often bore the shock, The good Man would in silence think— My best Friend is my Clock. At length, with rural notions fir'd The Citizen would live retir'd: That is—to get, as a retreat, A handsome, spacious country seat, Such as would suit his store of wealth, And give both consequence and health. Hoggart and Phillips soon supply A House might catch a Nabob's eye. Lofty the rooms, grounds well laid out, A garden well-wall'd round about, And a clear streamlet full of Trout; A Lawn, with groves of stately trees, Stables, cow-house, and piggeries; A dairy in the Gothic taste, Within a fragrant shrubbery plac'd: An Ice-house too the wine to cool, And a Cold-bath that's always full. Around the whole rich fields were seen, All clad in everlasting green. In short, the spot possess'd the charm To be a Villa and a Farm. —Th'Upholsterer in every part Expends the treasures of his art; Egyptian Stools, and Sofas proud, And Chairs and Lamps th'apartments croud; With marble slabs and splendid Glasses, Carpets so rich and China Vases: Yet still the fav'rite Clock must come, And click within the Breakfast-room. Unhappy Man—hadst thou read History, As well as the Stock Brokers' Mystery, How dang'rous 'tis, thou wouldst have known, Exclusive Fav'rites thus to own: What caus'd our second Edward's end, Was having Gaveston for a Friend: And who knows what your Clock may do, By some strange accident, to you. The Clock arriv'd, but in such plight, Its Master could not set it right;— How vex'd he was:—Not know the time, Nor hear each hour the well-known chime! For on the way the rumbling Cart Had shook it in some tender part, I've sworn, He said, and still I swear it, None but myself shall e'er come near it. —At length set right, with much ado, Again it told the time so true: But what it tells it can't bestow, A solemn truth that all should know: Though old John Dunn, with all his rout About his Clock, ne'er found it out. The Day to wind it up was come, The steps were brought into the room; When up he mounted, key in hand, But, e'er he could his work command, They totter'd first, then toppled o'er, And down he sinks to rise no more. What follows, 'tis confusion all, Poor Mrs. Dunn is heard to squall, And shares her falling Husband's fall. He felt the Lot of all mankind, He died—and left his Clock behind. But e'er it had with tell-tale power, Through one short month declar'd the Hour, It struck, to call the widow'd Spouse To wed a junior partner of the House. The Family of Children. IN looking through each diff'rent state, Wherein Mankind participate, Philosophers can ne'er agree On human Joy or Misery: What's the severest state of Woe, Or greatest pleasure here below. This knotty, subtle point depends On such contrasted views and ends, That how to draw the certain line And with precision nice define, What would imply extreme distress, Or mark the height of happiness, Is not within the narrow reach Of what Philosophy can teach. Horace has said, who was no Fool, As we all know who've been at School, That, on whatever project bent, Man is the prey of discontent. Broken with toils, with arms opprest, The Soldier thinks the Merchant blest; And when the threat'ning Tempests rise, Arm me for war, the Merchant cries: While he, who in the City lives, Sighs for the peace the Country gives; The Country Folk unheard, unknown, Think there's no pleasure but in Town. —Sir Frank pours forth his daily prayer To Heaven, that He may have an Heir. He joys not in his rural reign O'er peasant tribes and large domain; For nought can please, or cheer his spirit, Since there's no Offspring to inherit: While his near Neighbour Jemmy Guest, Of far inferior means possest, Thinks hourly how to cut and carve, Lest he, and sixteen Bairns should starve. Hence 'tis, we see, both weak and vain In erring mortals to complain; For where's the man in Life's vast range Who would his whole condition change. Ask one of his estate what share He'd give to purchase him an heir: To answer you, though somewhat loth, He might reply, he wants them both. Then ask the other would he spare Sir Frank a bantling for his heir; No, not for all his golden store, Though Heaven should send him twenty more. Of all things going, Jemmy Guest Lov'd his dear Wife and Children best; And this he proved since he could claim A Husband's and a Father's name. When He first married, at his door Was seen the dashing coach and four; But when five babes appear'd in view, It dwindled to a coach and two: At length, when other five were able To sit like Branches round his table, The call of Prudence he obeys, And only sports a one-horse chaise: For Jemmy Guest was always loth Beyond his coat to cut his cloth; And when he heard the babbling sounds Of full five more, He sold his hounds. He thought he had enough to do, For fifteen mouths to bake and brew; But, such was his prolific Dame, As Time went on, another came; And all his thought and all his care Was how to spend and how to spare. Though, still rewarded by the pleasure, With which he view'd his filial Treasure, As each in diff'rent charms appears, From one month old to eighteen years, His anxious fears he oft forgot, Of what might be their future Lot. When he beheld their Cherub Faces, Their growing forms, their youthful graces, He envied not the rich and great, Who roll in wealth and live in state; And, as he view'd his num'rous care, He would prefer the pious prayer: That Heav'n would give them daily food— Bless them with health—and make them good. One morn at breakfast, as He sat, Attentive to their various chat, Death at the door in form appear'd; And, as aloft his arm he rear'd, Jemmy began to stir and stare And ask'd the Shape his errand there. He grinn'd a ghastly smile, and said— To follow his old-fashioned trade. To get a pretty little picking Among this brood of human chicken. Jemmy replied—I'll ne'er consent To such a barbarous intent: Touch not, I pray, a single feather, Take none, or take us all together. —Think not, said Death, I'll march away, And let my arrow lose its prey: Why, here's this brat so loudly squalling— Leave him to me—I'll stop his bawling. —Poor little dear, it scarce can walk, And has but just began to talk. —Then there's the Babe in t'other room, Who will not talk for months to come. —If from her Nursling forc'd to part, T'would break the Angel Mother's heart. Indeed I cannot spare you one, So take us all, or pray be gone. But if you must employ your dart, E'er from this chamber you depart, To me and mine delay the curse, And make your meal upon the Nurse. Death's Door. AN endless Labour it would be, If through Life's vast variety, We were our journey to pursue, And bring each object to the view Which court our notice as we pass, And shew them all as in a Glass. Where is the Canvas would contain The Portraiture of ev'ry pain; Or whose most extended measure Would give the scene of ev'ry pleasure? Where is the volume in whose fold, Could, with due order, be enroll'd, Whate'er has pass'd in hours like thine, Or such an humble Life as mine? Direct your footsteps through the fields And see what rural Nature yields: Upon the Mountain breathe the gale, Or court the Zephyr in the vale. Sit on the Rock's stupendous steep, And view the wonders of the deep; Or stretch along the sandy shore, And listen as the Billows roar; Then pluck, with more advent'rous tread, The sea-shell from its briny bed. —Now take your Tablets, and proceed To write what other days may read; While Science doth her aid impart, And moral truths flow from the heart: But though the task should be begun, When Nature hails the rising sun, The orb will set, e'er it is done. —Go where the Hedge, in thicken'd row, Offers the flow'rets wild that blow; Which, never nurs'd by cult'ring art, To all, their humble charms impart. They live through Summer's sultry day; Then shed their leaves, and pass away. What though their tribes no perfume breathe, Yet still they're seen to form the wreath That doth the auburn ringlets dress Or bosom deck, of Shepherdess, And form a subject for the page Of Nature's work, by Nature's sage. Whate'er on Earth is seen to reign, Whate'er its darksome caves contain; Whate'er the wond'rous deep unfolds, Or the bright, starry circle holds; Or high or low, or great or small, Man's Hist'ry comprehends them all. In short, whate'er the Eye can scan, Is, as it were, a part of Man. All Nature, Art, whate'er appears Of their long records, through the years Which have pac'd on since years began, Is but the History of Man. What has been written or been thought, By wisdom or reflection brought, Through the long course of ev'ry age, By each philosopher and sage; All that's possess'd of ev'ry lore, Or heap'd in the collected store Of Bodleian or Vatican, Gives but the History of Man. The space that he is bound to fill, Is bright with good or dark with ill; It forms th'uncertain, checquer'd road That leads us to our last abode: But if our Life, as has been said By one who well the subject weigh'd, Is a disease, we may be sure, That Death can be the only cure. Hence the various forms that wait Impatient at Death's rugged gate. But happy, oh thrice happy they Who do not hasten on their way; Nor wish to go, nor strive to stay. But with a steady patience bear Th'allotted weight of human care; And grateful to benignant Heaven For all the frequent good that's given, Calmly behold th'approaching doom, Nor dread the confines of the Tomb,— But wait till Death says, all is o'er, Nor touch the Knocker at his Door. The Fire. AMONG the Perils that attend Our life, and oft produce its end, The Elements, each passing hour, Display their all-alarming power. —Fate waves his spear, th'infected air Fills wide-spread regions with despair; And Pestilence, with deadly breath, Makes them one dismal scene of death. —He strikes his foot, the groaning ground Strait trembles in the deep profound; Opes wide its vast and horrid womb, And to whole cities yields a tomb. —The Ocean to his will conforms, And rolls beneath the angry storms; In vain the Steersman rules the Helm, And waves the crouded Ship o'erwhelm. —He lights his torch, the fatal fire Spreads far and near with ruin dire; And Palaces and Temples lie A scene of splendid Misery. No Summons left t'awake our care, Against the mischief to prepare; As the Hawk pounces on its prey, These sudden evils ne'er betray Their fell approach, but strike the blow And leave the victims to their woe. War, note of preparation gives, And threatens e'er the foe arrives. The Son of Mars, amid th'alarms Of contest fierce and clashing arms, Well knows he may be doom'd to feel The wounding force of hostile steel; Nay, half expects that he may fall By bloody sword or flying ball: But still his prowess may sustain His life on the embattled plain, And He may rest, when all is done, Beneath the Laurels he has won. When Plenty o'er the blighted fields No more her ready sickle wields; When meadows lose their verdure green, Nor fruitage on the bough is seen; When Dearth in meagre form appears, We ope the hoards of former years; And in our straiten'd state maintain Submission firm, till Ceres reign, In its full bounty, smiles again. The Robber may our house despoil By daring theft or crafty toil; But though he makes our goods his prey, He cannot bear the House away: Takes what he can—but, coarsely kind, What he can't take, he leaves behind. Though 'tis a mischief all would shun, We may be robb'd, but not undone. —But when our house, or great or small, Whate'er it be, contains our all; A Conflagration's rapid power May prove our ruin in an hour. When we are robb'd we know the worst; But Fire's an evil most accurst: Where it begins we may discover, But who can tell when 'twill be over. Though safe we think our treasure lies, And well secur'd from hands and eyes: The Flames may come, and, to our cost, It may be melted down and lost. Bolts, and Bars, and Barricadoes, May disappoint midnight Bravadoes; But what can keep, we would enquire, A House from being set on Fire: Nay, should it be of Lath and Plaster, Nought could arrest the sad disaster; And, if its roof be made of Thatch, They must be quick who lift the Latch. Such was the case, as tells the tale, In Hernford's distant shady vale. —Joe Jenkins there free from alarm, Rented a small but fruitful Farm: Where he work'd hard, but liv'd content, And never fail'd to pay his rent. He had a wife and children three, Maintain'd by cheerful Industry; And by the names they both were known Of honest Joe and smiling Joan. But she was good as she was fair, And skill'd in ev'ry household care; Nor were three finer bantlings seen, 'Mong those who play'd upon the Green. One evening in the month of May, When all was blooming, sweet and gay, As Joan wound, on the turning reel, The labours of the spinning wheel, She listened to the Blackbird's song, Who tun'd his notes the Groves among; And carroll'd with her voice so shrill Of black-ey'd Sue and constant Will. At length Joe's daily labour o'er, They eat their supper at the door, And spar'd a morsel to the poor; A part they never fail'd to give, Of what Heav'n pleas'd they should receive; And, having bent in grateful prayer, To him who makes the good their care, Happy and in each other blest The faithful pair retir'd to rest, In hope to wake as free from sorrow, When the Sun shone upon to-morrow: But e'er the Sun in splendour rose They 'rose to view a scene of woes. For, e'er the midnight hour was past, They woke, and thought that hour their last. Around appear'd the blazing flames; The Mother, with incessant screams, And almost mad from her alarms, Seizing the children in her arms, Fled from her home and sat her down Beside the Brook upon a stone. While Joe, and many a neighbour's care, Brought all the Flames were found to spare. —The Villagers ran to and fro To save what could be sav'd for Joe; And women, screaming with affright, Encreas'd the horrors of the night. The slumb'ring sheep by fear made bold, Tumultuous grew and forc'd the fold; And bellowing loud, the herds were seen Scouring in fury o'er the Green. Among the rest a Shape appear'd: In either hand a torch he rear'd, And seem'd, as he was stalking on, Proud of the mischief he had done. The Sexton said, Death was his name: He knew him well, and that he came From church-yard nigh; nay, that the Bell Had of itself rung out a Knell. For though, as was his foul intent, They did no Christian's end lament, Yet it was seen Death had been there, As Joe's six pigs and founder'd mare Lay dead in stable and in sty, The work of the Incendiary. The House was down, of flames the prey; And, as the smoking ruins lay, Joe wrung his hands and wip'd his eye, And thus talk'd o'er his destiny. “'Twas in that House that I was born, “And Comfort smil'd but yester-morn; “But now I've neither house nor home, “Nor what to do in time to come, “I cannot tell; nor do I see “The end of my calamity.— “Alas, poor Joe, thy comfort's o'er, “And smiling Joan will smile no more.” “Peace,” said good Farmer Freeman, peace; “And let these sad complainings cease. “We all are born, as you should know, “To meet misfortune here below; “But then, my friend, it is as true, “That we should learn to bear it too. “Something is lost, but Heaven is kind; “For something too is left behind. “Your hoarded treasure's safe and sound, “As a stray Donkey in a pound: “The flames, at least, did not unlock it; “You have it close within your pocket. “Your Barns, you see, unhurt remain, “With all their last year's stock of grain: “Your Cow and Calf, and little Flock, “Have only felt a sudden shock: “Your Children too, have known no harm, “They rest upon their Mother's arm: “They feel no loss, they know no pain; “Joan sees they're safe, and smiles again. “In all the Hamlet's ample bound, “Aye, and in all the Country round, “There's not a heart that will not show “Its kind regard to honest Joe. “Besides your Landlord Squire Bounty, “Known for good deeds, throughout the County, “Will build, I doubt not, at his cost, “A better house than you have lost: “But till that House is snug and tight, “And honest Joe finds all things right; “He and his Wife, and Children three, “Shall come—aye come,—and live with me.” The Miser's End. FROM Charing Cross, to the Exchange, Take now your philosophic range, And as you saunter through each street, Translate the minds of all you meet; And you'll perceive, in great and small, Money's the word that's writ in all;— That their chief Happiness and Pain Is what they lose or what they gain. —Another morning take your walk Where the young Loungers idly stalk: Your scrutinizing eye prepare To view the scene of every Square: Saunt'ring down Bond-street, tow'rds the Park, Spare not your shrewd and keen remark: From the gay bustle and confusion, Your thoughts will come to this conclusion: In all that's seen, in all that's heard, Pleasure's the fascinating word. On this the unerring truth must rest, What does most good must be the best, Which then is best suppose we try (By rules of general policy, As public Int'rest deals the measure,) The Love of Gain, or Love of Pleasure: Though in the last we comprehend Whate'er may to the Fancy bend; Whate'er may gild the State of Power, Or decks fond Fashion's varying hour; Flatters the whimsies of the dull, Or fills the Cup of Folly full. We might the ways of Wisdom scan; But 'tis not in our present plan To treat of any thing but Man; Of Man, in many of his ways, As seen in these degenerate days. I ask, by him what good is done, Who from the morn to setting sun Employs his never-ceasing care To gain, to treasure, and to spare; And often borrows hours from sleep, To give his hoards the added heap. —Of all our failings, this same thirst Of hoarding money is the worst: For by that Passion is subdu'd Each wish or thought of doing good. Nor does gold cheer the owner's breast But by the sense that 'tis possest.— Not so the Sons of Pleasure, they Make all around them glad and gay; And by their sportive fancies strive To keep the passing world alive. They take another course 'tis true, And not without its follies too; But though they prudent rules defy, And briskly let their money fly, While their run lasts, 'tis understood That such folks do a deal of good. If 'mong the changes that arise And daily meet our wond'ring eyes, It were the Fashion to be wise; That Reason should decide the measure Of ev'ry want and ev'ry pleasure; Were such an alteration made, Half London Town must leave off Trade. Should all disdain the sweets of sense, And look for Health to abstinence, Content plain meats to cut and carve, Cooks and Confectioners must starve. And they to harder Trades must stoop, Who Fortunes make by Turtle Soup. —If they alone bought books who need 'em, Or which is rarer still—who read 'em, How many a Mill would stand and rot, And wire-wove paper be forgot. —If none form'd Libraries for show, Nor wish'd to make each Book a Beau; If Learning never was profuse, Nor e'er bought volumes but for use, Morocco, with its gawdy airs, Would be confin'd to Shoes and Chairs. In short, when Spendthrift Folly dies, And Fops leave off their Luxuries, Few dashing retail men will run To country cot in Chaise and one; And more than half our trading elves, Would shut up shop, or hang themselves. Gripus, a money-getting Sage, Was now grown old with care and age: His daily Joy was reck'ning o'er The value of his hoarded Store. Though this fond Task produc'd a sigh, Whene'er he thought that he must die, And bid his darling gold good bye. He had a Son, a sharp young Spark, Long bound as an Attorney's Clerk; For Gripus thought that such a shop Requir'd no Cash to set him up. He knew a share of Common Sense, More cunning and some impudence, Was, as the adage old has said, Sufficient for th'Attorney's trade. His Daughter too was blooming fair As roses, and as lillies are; And Gripus never spar'd expence To give her beauty consequence. She could Clementi's Lessons play, And sing each tonish Roundelay: Could give full force to Flat or Sharp On the Piano or the Harp. —Besides, the lively, smiling Wench, Could step a Waltz, and jabber French; And oft her ready hand was seen Painting a Table or a Screen: For much he thought her charming face, Heighten'd by each acquir'd grace, Would, by the aid of Cupid's dart, Seize on some wealthy Damon's heart, Who, without asking for a Dower, Would lead her to the Nuptial Bower. One day Jack came—'twas Monday eve, His stated stipend to receive; Which Gripus always kindly paid, Nor ever did the Boy upbraid; And thus his narrow heart consol'd When from his hand he loos'd his gold. “If to poor Jack I nothing gave, “How would he ever learn to save.” —He gently tapp'd—Death op'd the door; Jack star'd, as he ne'er star'd before. The Spectre took him by the arm And bid him quiet his alarm. “Just look around, and what appears “Will, I think, tranquillise your fears: “Upon that Couch your Father lies: “I have for ever clos'd his eyes; “While here, my Boy, you see around you, “What may, perhaps, at first confound you; “But you'll forgive me the intrusion, “And soon get rid of your confusion.” The Daughter then lamenting came, And with her the old Household Dame; But when the Treasure they espy, The Ladies both forgot to cry. Jack, who had learn'd a thing or two, As Lawyers' Clerks are apt to do, Transferr'd his Dad to t'other room, And bade the Undertaker come: Then double-lock'd the Iron Door, To talk with Bell the matter o'er. They read the Will, when all was right, Then supper eat with appetite, And chatter'd on till twelve at night. The Fun'ral Rites all duly paid, And Gripus 'neath the marble laid, Again the Iron Door they op'd, And, having in each corner grop'd, Bell took her Forty thousand pound, And soon a wealthy Husband found: Jack by the Will took all the rest, And soon became a Buck profest. Well-pleas'd he, with contemptuous grin, Took his last leave of Thavies Inn; And 'twas not long e'er he was known A first-rate Swell upon the Town. But Jack was shrewd, with cunning fraught, The Attorney's Desk the Youth had taught A certain wary kind of Knowledge That's caught up in no other College: For though he sought the road to ruin, It took ten years to his undoing: And when 'twas thought that all was gone, Jack was not such a Simpleton But he contriv'd to stitch together A rough, warm coat for rainy weather; And seem'd contented to retire, A knowing, petty Country 'Squire. No one will Son or Father praise, They both were bad in diff'rent ways: The one was known his life to pass An useless treasure to a mass: The other spent it like an Ass. For neither Jack nor Gripus knew The happy medium to pursue The art between the extremes to move Of idle waste or mad Self-love: A knowledge which, when once possess'd, Preserves men good, and makes them blest. But still I hold this Maxim true,— Jack was the better of the Two. Gretna Green. ASK what is Love,—or where 'tis found In our Life's busy, ceaseless round, Enquire of all you chance to meet, In every house, in ev'ry Street; And then weigh well the strange replies From old and young, from fools and wise, From rich and poor, from great and small, When much I fear, among them all, You'll scarce find two who will agree In its essential Quality. Ask Lady Bell who 'mong the Ton So long has made her Graces known, And she will the soft Passion fix In settlement and Coach-and-six: A splendid Seat, for country air, And a Town House in Grosvenor Square: With Balls and Fêtes, and all that Taste Employs to bring great Wealth to waste. —Matilda, who has fill'd her mind With all the Learning she could find In the long, never-ending page Of writings which o'erflow the age, Novels yclep'd, will, while she glories In her vast range of tender stories, Tell you that Love is made of sighs, And feeds on sensibilities; That sighs alone the Passion prove, And when they cease, you cease to love. —The Citizen, who has the itch Of lab'ring hard and growing rich: Who rises early, sits up late, To form in time a large estate, Will talk of Love as of a thing That may a store of profit bring: Cupid in vain may shoot his dart, It ne'er will pierce the good man's heart; In vain would he exhaust his quiver To perforate the good man's liver: Those weapons ne'er will make him feel Whose points are only made of steel. The God of Love will be cajol'd Unless his darts are tip't with gold. Nay, when Sir Mat resolv'd to wed, And take a fair one to his bed, His thoughts of matrimonial bliss Were in the Portion, not the Miss. —Sir Amorous will say, 'tis clear That this same Love is every where: In all the corners of the Town He does the Magic Influence own: At Balls, at Operas or Plays, He feels the God's enliv'ning rays; While the same Power, he finds, pervades The rural Scenes and sylvan Shades: It is a thing He always lights on At Hastings, Tunbridge Wells, and Brighton. Nor has he fail'd to feel it's joy In a Stage Coach, or Margate Hoy; In short, where'er he's doom'd to move, He never fails to meet with Love. But then 'tis transient as the wind, No sooner found than left behind: Though all its pleasure or its pain The Knight ne'er ventures to explain. —Enquire of certain married Dames What they can say of Cupid's flames; They'll tell you Cupid's ev'ry where, Unless a horrid Husband's there; For He may be, as they might prove, A perfect Antidote to Love. —The Dowager will shake her head, As she laments an Husband dead, And tell you all her Love to come Is buried in the dead Man's tomb. There Cupid weeps, and Hymen too, Until another comes to woo. —Ask the Coquette where Love must please; She'll say—in ev'ry Man she sees. 'Tis true the Lady will prefer Fops of high rank and character: The Baron bold, in splendor drest With the Star glitt'ring on his breast, Or, the first boast of Chivalry, With Garter twining round his knee. Or if her smiles do not inspire The prouder Nobles to admire, She will exchange in Fashion's Dance With common Lords the am'rous glance. But should they her allurements slight, She'll grace a Ball-room with a Knight; Or to a 'Squire throw out a Lure, And, for the hour, his vows endure: Nay, her general scheme to vary, She'll flirt with her Apothecary. When to far distant scenes retir'd, She still resolves to be admir'd, And strives the Curate to subdue, By well-form'd oglings from a Pew. Hence with this fair one, it is prov'd, To be admir'd is to be lov'd. Ask Virtue what is Love—she'll say It is a mild, celestial ray That warms and purifies the heart From ev'ry foul and grosser part, And leaves it, as it first was given, The most delightful boon of Heaven; So form'd to sooth the scene of woe That Man must suffer here below. —Require of Happiness to tell Where 'tis she never fails to dwell. She'll answer, 'neath the Domes of State, The dwellings of the rich and great; Or in the humble low-roof'd cot, Where Poverty's the Owner's Lot; If, rich or poor, they do but prove The solid Joys of virtuous Love. —Ask Vice her thoughts of such a flame, Of which she scarce can tell the name: Perhaps an answer she'll refuse, And strait refer you to the Stews. Miss Betsy, in her eighteenth year, The Captain whisp'ring in her ear, Began to think Love might be seen In Chaise-and-four to Gretna Green. She had been left an orphan Fair, To Doctor Julap's guardian Care: With Lands, and Money in the Stocks, And Notes and Bonds in Iron Box; That, altogether would be found At least worth Thirty thousand pound. No Guardian watch'd with more regard Than Julap did, his wealthy Ward; For 'twas the object of his Life, To turn his Ward into his Wife. Nay, he employ'd his utmost skill In working on Miss Betsy's will, To take his Matrimonial Pill. But a fine Youth, in Country Quarters, Defied his Pestle and his Mortars: For he contriv'd to tell his Tale Not by the Hawthorn in the Dale; Nor as fond Pyramus of old His Love to gentle Thisbe told, And did the Lady's heart enthrall Through chinks, and crannies in the wall. The Captain did his passion pledge In Julap's garden through the hedge: Where wild flow'rs bloom'd, and Thrushes sung, She heard the Hero's flatt'ring tongue; And there with mutual delight, They plann'd the unsuspected flight. One night the Doctor went to bed With wealth and Betsy in his head: Physic and Patients all forgot, How to tie fast the Nuptial Knot, Employ'd his anxious thoughts till sleep Did o'er his wearied senses creep: But while deceiful Morpheus spread The happy vision round his head. That gave to his enamour'd view, The Fair, and all her fortune too, Mary into his chamber popp'd, With, “Sir, Miss Betsy is elop'd.” He instant rose and, in a rage, Like the Third Richard on the Stage, Call'd for his Horse of well-known-speed, To check the execrable deed; And, rising quickly from his bolster, Order'd his Pistols to the Holster. The Doctor soon had got the scent Of the High Road the Lovers went, And posted off, a bold Knight Errant, Well arm'd with magisterial warrant: He follow'd fast, nor was it long Before, by dint of Spur and Thong, The flying Equipage he view'd That held the Fair whom he pursu'd. As He drew nigh each desperate Lover Did signs of stout defence discover. The Captain loud exclaim'd, “Retire; “Or, by the Prize I bear, I'll fire: “I shall prescribe a Leaden Pill “Which, like your own, is sure to kill.” An equal threat from Betsy came: “I swear,” she cried, “by Love's fierce flame, “I'll be my gallant Soldier's Wife:— “Stop then, or tremble for your Life.” Down the steep Hill away they flew, Away the Doctor hurried too, Keeping aloof till they should come Where Pow'r might send Miss Betsy home. But e'er they reach'd the neighbouring Town Poor Julap from his Horse was thrown, And pitch'd Head-foremost on a Stone. Death who, in honour of his Friend, Did as his faithful Groom attend, Now took him up a lifeless Corse, And threw it 'cross th'unconscious horse; Then led him quietly away, To grace the triumphs of the day. The Post-boys cried, as they drove on, We're sure the Doctor's work is done: They loudly swore they saw him fall, And dash his brains out 'gainst the wall. “—Ne'er mind, drive on,” Miss Betsy said; “Lives will be sav'd if he is dead; “And no more plagues will intervene, “To stop our Course to Gretna Green.” The Waltz. WHAT is Beauty—what is Grace, Or in the Form or in the Face, Many have found it hard to tell Who reason'd right and argu'd well; For various knotty points appear, Which all discuss and few can clear. Hogarth has said that none could miss On reading his Analysis The Analysis of Beauty., The knowledge of that certain Line, Which does unerringly define What Beauty is, and taught to trace The genuine principles of Grace. The Form, for Hogarth was no Fool, He borrow'd from the Grecian School. Antinous in mild beauty stands, The work of some great Sculptor's hands, Whose skill adorn'd the Fanes of Greece; It might be a Praxitiles. There Nature unconstrain'd by art, Displays to view each perfect part: Each Limb had been unbound and free E'en from the hours of Infancy: No swaddling cloaths the Form oppress'd While hanging at the Mother's breast; And Freedom in the Babe began To shape with Grace the future man. Thus in that boasted Age we see, Athens so proud of Liberty, Beheld her offspring unconfin'd, As free in Body as in Mind. —Thus did she train to ev'ry Grace Her manly Youth and martial Race; While Phidias, in his walks might meet Forms fit for Gods in ev'ry Street; And many a Phœbus might be seen Or in the Cirque or on the Green, While rival Venuses display'd Their Beauties, dancing in the shade. Our Native Artist whose acclaim Will last while Art can give a Name, To strike by contrast, boldly placed Near the Greek Form, a figure graced With all the cumbrous folds of Plaster, In shape of modern Dancing Master; Nor could the purest power of Art, With a more height'ning force impart The difference 'tween the Grace that's caught, By fine examples daily taught, Which ev'ry hour attracts the eye In Motion and in Symmetry; And that which Catgut and the Wire With Beau-kit's Bravos can inspire; Those smirking Gestures which appear To've been transmitted through the Ear, And when the Fidlers cease to play, Vanish at once, and pass away. Thus in the modern School we trace To Fashion what is Air and Grace. All that the changeful Phantom says, Or right or wrong in these fine days, Each Sex implicitly obeys: Hence 'tis, we see, gay folks appear As Fancy changes, through the year. If some fair Duchess, fat and frowsy, Striving to lose the looking blowzy, Lessens the Circle of her waist By Corsets stiff and tightly lac'd; Does all her flowing ringlets check, That threat to amplify her neck; Throws to the air her lofty bonnet, And places plumes of Feathers on it; Thus losing, in Dame Nature's spite, Her real breadth, by artful height, She does no more than is her duty; For 'tis the Policy of Beauty, To hide defects, and to hold forth The charms which are of native growth. —But then come those whose inclination Is to be ever in the Fashion; And though they be but skin and bone, They must conform to what's the Ton. Who, tall enough to make folks stare As Female Giants at a Fair, Still must compress their thin waists smaller, And make their gawky figures taller. Nature and Reason both oppose it, But then the great fat Duchess does it. If Lord or Knight, or dashing 'Squire, Does with a noble zeal aspire, Since Chivalry is at a stand, To take the Lead with Four-in-hand; To dress, to swear, to spit, to rail Like high-bred Drivers of the Mail; Your Office Clerk and dashing Cit Will show their Taste, and prove their wit, By Banging up and Banging down In Gigs and Tillb'ries round the Town; Rap out an Oath, or stylish word, Not like a Coachman—but a Lord. 'Tis not alone in dress or driving That Fashion's cutting or contriving Manners that form the Grace of Life Or in the Daughter or the Wife, From that o'erflowing source receive, The Charms its fangled notions give. —Fair Cælia had some girlish Faults; But then—How Cælia stepp'd a Waltz! And in that Season, it is known Waltzing was everywhere the Ton. Miss Cælia, though a sickly Maid, No friendly counsels could persuade To stay at Home, when Fashion's call Summon'd the Damsel to a Ball: From Party, Opera or Play, She might be coax'd to keep away; But she possess'd the high renown, Of the most pleasing Dancer known; Besides she hop'd, her graceful Charms, Would Waltz her to a Husband's Arms. Nor the grave Doctor's daily threat, Nor a fond Mother's keen regret, Nor Hectic Cough, that oft oppress'd With strong convulse, her heaving breast, Could when th'enchanting fiddle mov'd, Keep her from that display she lov'd, And which each eye that saw approv'd. —One vernal morn, with great delight She practis'd for th'approaching night. Some new-invented Step she paces,— The Teacher play'd off his Grimaces; And while he boasted to impart Some added Beauties of his Art, She sinks, she faints, she pants for breath: Alas! it was the Waltz of Death.” Maternal Tenderness. WHAT with such Power the heart can move As a young, doting Mother's Love! While gazing on her infant Care, The Passion of her Soul is there. When the Babe hangs upon the Breast With what a rapture He's carest! If, in that inexpressive Hour, The Master of Imperial Power Should through each tempting region range, And offer all for the Exchange, Her eyes she'd rivet on his charms, And clasp him closer in her arms. —The Mother's fondness for her child Is Nature pure and undefil'd; Nor mix'd as other passions are With Fancy's glow or sordid care; Has Joys to Mothers only known, And is, in truth, itself alone. When the sweet Boy, with growing charm, Disdains the tender Nurse's arm, And as strength guides his better speed, New Joys and other cares succeed. Learning now points the glimm'ring way, And lights him with its feeble ray: At length its warmer beams express The bloom of future fruitfulness. Then Reason will begin to stir The embryo seeds of Character, And the fond parent looks to scan The virtues of the future man. —Next, boyish feats and active strife Add new varieties to life. From strict restraint and thraldom free, He dares to climb the branchy tree; Oe'r many an headland course to run, Nor fears the heats of sultry sun: Or, on the frozen surface bold, Breasts the keen Winter's piercing cold: O'er thorny hedge is seen to bound And light on the uncertain ground; Or yet, untaught by due controul, Drives the rough poney to the Goal; Seeks the dark mazes of the wood, Or plunges in the running flood. Thus playing with a Mother's fear, Thus calling forth the secret tear, And often smiling at the pain That fond Affection cannot feign. The fair Matilda married young, And, while the song of Joy she sung, While 'twas her envied Lot to prove The sweetest bliss of wedded Love, Relentless Death prepared his dart, And pierc'd the faithful Husband's heart: But though a widow thus bereft, Indulgent Heaven one comfort left, To help her the sad Loss to bear, And save her sorrow from despair. A Babe in Beauty's infant grace, The Father smiling in his face, Would check the tear that strove to flow And be the solace of her woe, Would her pale, saddened face beguile And 'midst its gloom awake a smile. When fond remembrance feign would dwell On that dear form she lov'd so well: She in th'unconscious Babe could view The Offspring and the Father too. The widow and the mother prov'd With what a constancy she lov'd; Resolv'd to dedicate her days, Not to the idle, empty praise Of the gay world's incessant prate, Or pleasures that on Fortune wait, But her maternal cares to ply, Departed Love's sad Legacy; She hop'd to rear a solid fame On Duties which her child would claim. Beauty was her's, and ev'ry charm That doth the tender bosom warm: And though her Lilies grew more pale, And though her roseate blushes fail, Yet Youth and Time were waiting there, Grief's early inroads to repair. The winning Look, the graceful mien Were still with Admiration seen; Still did th'harmonious voice impart The blended sense of mind and heart: Of riches she was left a store, Her purse was full, nay, running o'er,— Nor did her bounteous hand refrain, Nor could a chilling thought restrain The gift that goodness loves to grant, To all who weep and all who want. Thus none who knew her but approv'd, And some the widow'd charmer lov'd. —But when she heard of Hymen's name, When Cupid wav'd the proffer'd flame; When Lovers hop'd she would be won, She pointed to her Darling Son: Your suits are all in vain, she said; No Eloquence will e'er dissuade My purpose now so firmly made. The little, playful Boy you see, Is Cupid, Hymen, all to me. Their Altar I shall ne'er attend, Till Heaven, my wishes to befriend, Gives me to view my Edward there, My only hope, my darling care; There, bound by Hymen's chaste decree, To one who thinks and loves like me. —'Twas thus she liv'd, while Edward grew To all his Mother's wishes true. But still the dangers that belay The passage of Life's early day; Would often cause her eyes to weep, And discompose the hours of sleep; While many a fearful omen crept Across her Fancy when she slept. Edward, a noble Boy, had gain'd Full fourteen years, which, when obtain'd, The parent weighs, with equal scales, His future fate,—and Hope prevails. —'Twas when, in Summer's sultry hour, Fierce Sirius gleam'd with ardent power, That the Youth sought the cooling flood Beside the verdure of a wood; But, while he cleav'd the liquid way, His limbs no longer would obey. He shriek'd, the woodman sought the wave, And plung'd, the sinking form to save, From what appear'd a watry grave. His voice alarm'd the peasants near, And, hast'ning on the wings of fear They reach the stately Hall, nor wait To ask admission at the gate; While cries throughout the walls resound, “Our young, our darling Master's drown'd.” The Servants fly they scarce know where; The tidings reach Matilda's ear: She starts,—then hurries to the wood— Aghast, upon the bank she stood, While from the pool, with looks forlorn, Her senseless Edward's form is borne. She sinks, weigh'd down by her alarms; And Death receives her in his arms. —The unconscious Youth now opes his eyes.— The Son survives,—the Mother dies.— The Kitchen. IS there a thing in Art or Nature, A Bird or Beast, or Human Creature, Which in Death's business is not made An Engine to promote his trade? Look where you will, go where you can, You see the final foe of Man. Lions and Tygers, Dogs and Cats, The pois'nous Asp, the stinging Gnats, The Cart that rolls, the Coach that flies, Tandems and Gigs and Tilburies; The Ship that dares the dang'rous deep, The Boat that doth the river sweep; The Eastern wind, the sudden Squall, The gliding Skait, the whirling Ball, All in their various ways supply The means by which frail man may die. The potent drug, the boasted pill, The very hope of health, may kill: E'en Justice takes a fatal part, And with a Lawsuit breaks a heart. In the arm'd field and War's affray, Death takes his thousands in a day; While, in the alley and the street, The Gin-Shop deals the deadly treat, And Fate prepares the winding-sheet. How many a scaffold's giddy height Hurls to the shades of endless night; While to the Lazaretto's shed Are borne the dying and the dead. The dagger's blade, the leaden bullet, And hempen string around the gullet, The Pugilist's well-levell'd joint, Or the bare bodkin's humble point, These, and a thousand more, the eye Can with its daily glance descry In the dread Spectre's Armoury: He can to all his purpose fit Or with a spear or with a spit. But it is not the weapon's force, The sudden stroke or furious course Death always chuses to assume, To usher mortals to the tomb: He'll lay aside the poison'd cup, Which, at one certain, hasty sup, He often drinks Life's current up; And will our nature undermine E'en on the food on which we dine; Nay, with slow, pois'nous power, controul The operations of the bowl; Season the Glutton's daily feast, And fat him as we fat a beast; Smile grimly, o'er each rich repast, Till the gorg'd Corm'rant bursts at last. One day, Death, tempted by the scent, Into Lord Ort'lan's Kitchen went; Well-pleas'd he views the various show Of Fricasee and Fricandeau, Of ev'ry Flesh, and Fowl and Fish, Prepar'd to grace each silver dish, Of roast and boil'd, of Grill and Stew, Turtle and Ven'son and Ragout: And, as he with attention pauses At saucepans strong with fine-drawn Sauces, His mischief was quite charm'd to see The poison of the Chemistry: But while he made his purpose known To add a little of his own, The Cook, who was a man of might, And o'er his Kitchen claim'd a right, Determin'd to attack the Sprite. His right-hand did a Carver wield, A pot-lid serv'd him for a shield: Begone—he cried, or, with this point. I'll dislocate you joint from joint, And I declare it, by my troth, I'll take your bones and make them broth. —Death seiz'd the Roaster in his ire, As it was turning at the Fire; And fiercely, without more ado, He ran the Cook quite through and through. There, He exclaim'd, you now are fitted;— With your own Turkey you are spitted; And of that Paunch I shall prepare An Entremet for this day's fare. The Clock struck Seven.—it was the hour When my Lord us'd to feel the power That bred a craving near his heart For Courses two, and a Desert. He rung his Bell,—“Pray what's the riot? “Serve up the Dinner, and be quiet.”— “Sad news to tell,” the Butler said, “But poor Morel the Cook is dead: “Struck, somehow, with I know not what, “He sunk at once, and went to pot; “He utter'd one tremendous groan, “And fell as dead as any stone. “The down-fall was with horrid clatter “Of pot and dish, of pan and platter: “The Kitchen-maids were all aghast, “And all forgot my Lord's repast; “Nay, whether stew'd, or roast or boil'd, “I fear that ev'ry dish is spoil'd; “For such an Uproar ne'er was seen, “In Kitchen where I've ever been.”— “Get what you can,” my Lord replies, “For I must live, whoever dies:— “Hang the fat gormandising sinner “For dying,—till he had dress'd the dinner.” The Gig. AMBITION is a noble flame, But then how various is its aim: For look through Life, or great or small, From Council Board to humble Stall, It is a Passion felt by all. When the brave Soldier seeks the wreath Through hostile realms 'mid blood and death; When Statesmen's plotting arts combine To raise to Power the gilded shrine; When Eloquence pursues the fame That waits upon a Tully's name; When Poetry invents the verse For future ages to rehearse, When deep Philosophers display To Science many an added ray; Whatever honour they attain, It is Ambition leads the train. In other scenes the Passion glows It's tide in other Channels flows, As it is seen to be allied To all the forms assum'd by Pride. —In Fashion's course to take the Ton, When to leave off and when put on; What plumes should nod upon the brow, What flounces deck the dress below; Whether the foot should just appear, Or the Robe leave the Ancle bare; How far the bosom should display Its Beauty to the glaring day; Whether with upright gait to stalk Or with a bending grace to walk; In short to give the varying rules To the Ton's all-obedient fools, Is an Ambition to be found In the world's gay and giddy round. Thus Lady Gew-gaw feels a pride To be the youthful Female's guide. As Bond Street's range she's seen to grace, By Blood-Bays drawn in stately pace, I give, she cries, the ev'ry air To all the Misses tramping there. Among the Forms this passion takes, Of high-born men it Coachmen makes: And bids the Heir of wealth assume The low-wrought semblance of a Groom. Thus, while we mark the high-flown dream, There is a Bathos in the scheme. While we the power of rising view, We see the art of sinking too. Hence while one Noble shall appear To be the nation's Charioteer, Others of equal rank and birth, Will mix with common sons of earth; Nor think they of the wheels of State, But how to drive through Hyde Park gate, And, on a Sunday in the Spring, To play Jehu, and be the Thing. The Chief of Macedon unfurl'd His Standard o'er a conquer'd world; But, having not enough to do, He ask'd another world or two; For, form'd of such ambitious stuff, He thought one world was not enough. But in the midst of all his power, He sought to pass a Leisure hour With a Philosopher of Greece, Well known as one Diogenes; And here he found a surly Elf Full as ambitious as himself: Within the mind his haughty pride Was full as long, as broad and wide; But the same Spirit, strange to tell, Confin'd him to a narrow Cell, Nor suffer'd him to push a quarrel Beyond the limits of his barrel. Ne'er did the Conq'ror whose name Is graven on the rock of Fame, E'er feel more pride at what he'd done E'en though the world were looking on, Than the rude Cynic at the rub He gave the Victor from the Tub. But if the Muse should turn her Car And eastward drive of Temple Bar, Then onward, in due order range Or to the Bank or the Exchange, Ambition will be found possesst Of various forms as in the West. But Money there gives all the fire:— 'Tis Wealth to which they all aspire. If Honour shares the anxious mind, 'Tis Honour that's with Wealth combin'd; The splendor of a titled Mayor, Or power of a Director's Chair. But some will, now or then, launch forth Before their time, to prove their worth; Who have the Ambition to appear More wealthy than in fact they are; Or, in their pride, to shew their taste, Will idly run themselves to waste. Jack Muslin understood his trade, And such a Fortune might have made, As was well suited to his station, With a good Cheapside Reputation, Had he resolv'd to toil and strive On to the Age of Forty-five: But Jack had some how got the itch To be reputed growing rich; And thought too, while yet in his vigour, It was the time to make a figure: Thus his ambition run the rig To have a well-bred Horse and Gig; While Madam thought it might prepare The way to have a Chaise and Pair. —Thus 'twas not many weeks before, From time to time, at Warehouse door, The Horse and Gig the Neighbours spy, And wonder at the Luxury. —No longer now it was Jack's boast What this thing fetch'd—what that thing cost; How fair his trade, how few his crosses, And how his Gains surpass'd his Losses. —He now declares, and stakes his word, He gave the go-by to a Lord; And that He'd driven to a stand Sir Harry, with his Four-in-hand. So fine his Horse, and such his power, He could trot fourteen miles an hour; And then he'd wager, play or pay, To go to Brighton in a day. —Ma'am Muslin, also, ceas'd to tell To whom their various goods they sell, Or boast their windows' rich supply To tempt the wish, to catch the eye Of the vast throng of passers by. She simper'd now, and would declare How sweet to breathe the Windsor air; That the Princesses she had seen, And humbly curtsied to the Queen: While Epsom, Egham, Ascott Races Were such delightful, charming Places. Thus Folly grew, and soon the Shop, With all its gains, began to drop: For Trade, as known to common sense, Can never thrive by negligence. When Jack appear'd, with shaking head, The neighbours to each other said,— “Aye, there He goes,—but 'tis so fast, “His Horse and Gig will never last.” And it pleas'd Fate, as we shall see, Soon to fulfill the Prophecy; Though not exactly in the way That Prudence threat'ned every day. One morning Jack, in all his pride, Went out with Madam by his side, When, as they drove down Shooter's Hill, Death grac'd a mile-stone, squat and still. Th'affrighted Horse now plung'd, now flew: Th'unequal reins then snapp'd in two: Jack was thrown back and tumbled o'er, Groan'd for a while, then breath'd no more: While Madam, jumping from the side, Fell at the Spectre's feet, and died.— As poor Jack's credit 'gan to fail him, And without Children to bewail him, His Friends did not that Fate regret, Which sav'd his name from the Gazette; For, had he liv'd, he would have found the Art To turn his Gig into a Bankrupt Cart. The Mausoleum. “NO, No,”—Sir Gabriel Giltspur said, “No, not a Doit till I am dead. “Not one, my Girl, till I am sent “To the old, solemn Tenement, “Where, in due state and order, lie “The ancient Giltspur Ancestry. “And if Lord Edward loves you true, “As all young men will say they do, “He will with tender patience wait “Till I am borne through yonder gate. “Old as I am, 'twill not be long “Before Time chaunts my fun'ral song; “And I have told you, o'er and o'er, “No Fortune, 'till I am no more. “You, Lissy, are my only Heir, “And little know the anxious care “With which I've shap'd your future life “Whether a Maiden or a Wife; “How strait I've drawn the legal line “To keep my wealth unalter'd thine; “To guard thy Love from lavish doing, “Nor let a Spendthrift prove thy ruin. “No Lord shall thy fair Dowry claim “Unless he takes the Giltspur name: “A name, for many a cent'ry past “To honour known;—and it shall last “If parchment deed, with seals set to it, “Or Will and Testament can do it. “Which you howe'er can never read, “Till I am number'd with the dead.” Thus to his only Child he spoke, While she his favour did invoke; And strove his kind assent to move, That Hymen's wreath might crown her Love. It seems Lord Edward had impress'd His image on Melissa's breast; And he had sworn with am'rous art That she posses'd his faithful heart: But still he thought it might not thrive, If, while Sir Giltspur were alive, They were to urge the Nuptial Deed To flight on t'other side the Tweed. He reckon'd that his Soldier's pay Did not exceed three pounds a day, And what the Duke, his grumbling Dad, Might, to support the Nuptials, add, Would never, as he thought it o'er, Turn Chaise and pair to Chaise and four:— He thought it, therefore, best to stay, And crown his Love some future day, When Fate might wield his spear and prove The Harbinger of wedded Love. —Thus they would oft at Evening meet, And mix discourse with Kisses sweet; Along the riv'let's bank would roam, Talking of Happiness to come; While sometimes, passing folk would see 'em Looking athwart the Mausoleum: But Cupid, though an errant Thief, No pick-lock had to give relief, His efforts vain he would deplore And curse th'impenetrable door, Whose grating hinges would obey No Hand but his who kept the Key:— What could they then but patient wait, Till that hand op'd the pond'rous gate. Not far from where the Building stood, In the dark op'ning of a Wood, With all his well-known symbols grac'd, The Statue of Old Time was plac'd, Here they would pass their tender hours And deck the sculptur'd form with flowers; While chaplets of perennial green Upon his naked pate were seen. Such were the Off'rings they bestow'd In honour of the fleeting God; Although they felt the full disaster That he fled not a little faster. But 'twas in vain to sigh and sue, For what could the old Pagan do? He was o'er-rul'd, nor could his pace Be quicken'd in the daily race; His plumage could not quicker move By any artifice of Love: But it appears, search the world over, There's nought so thoughtless as a Lover. Thus Time went on his usual way, From Hour to Hour, from Day to Day; But prov'd, at length, the Lover's friend, And brought Sir Giltspur to his end. The Knight was to his room confin'd, Hobbling and weak, and almost blind; So that Melissa, when she chose Of short-liv'd Joy, to pluck the rose, Would mount her Carriage and repair Among the Groves to take the air, In hope to meet Lord Edward there. One morning, as the Lovers stray'd, And talk'd of Joys so long delay'd, Sir Giltspur moving on was seen In dismal pace across the Green, And by his side, to help him on, Appear'd a busy Skeleton. Slow was their march, and it was bent To the Sepulchral Monument. Death, for a moment, stepp'd before, And quickly op'd the creaking Door. The threshold pass'd, the Door was clos'd And there Sir Giltspur soon repos'd;— There his remains in silence lie, With all his boasted Ancestry. “Let us,” Melissa gravely said, “Turn from these Dirges of the Dead!— “—The Carriage waits,—Lord Edward come,— “And we will go, and weep at Home.” The Courtship. BELINDA, what few Women prove, Was a Philosopher in Love: She saw that, in the world, the Passion Was something like a dress in fashion; Not made for any lasting uses, But to put on as Fancy chuses; And to put off with equal ease As the prevailing whimsies please. Fondness and Rapture, and all that Were words employ'd in common chat, Which did no solid meaning bear, But told to ev'ry list'ning fair, Who chose to hear what Foplings say And court the Flattery of the day; Which, 'ere 'tis spoke, has ta'en its flight, And never lasts from noon till night: While for that self-same thing call'd Love, What do its best professors prove, But that its Hopes, and Fears, and Sighs, Are Phantoms or Non-Entities; And, in the wise man's volume found, As nought but an unmeaning sound. Thus would the fair Belinda reason, As she denied that it was treason For Females to employ their mind On subjects of an higher kind. Authors who on those subjects wrote, She oft had studied and could quote. She knew grave men had oft disputed, Though none appear'd to be confuted; As none had e'er presum'd to prove Where is the real seat of Love. Some did the fine opinion start, That it took place within the Heart; Others, the mark for Cupid's Quiver, Would boldly argue was the Liver; But still the best could only doubt, As none of them had found it out. Thus, as she thought, she us'd to flout it, And look'd to find a Mate without it; To go with Hymen to the Altar, But threatning Cupid with a Halter, If the insulting Urchin dare To make his sly appearance there. But still she never fail'd to own It was not good to live alone: That Nature had by certain Laws, Of which she well could trace the cause, To carry on the scheme of Life, Ordain'd the tie of Man and Wife; And Wife she was resolv'd to be, When, grac'd with stern fidelity And manly virtue she could find A Suitor fashion'd to her mind; Whose Thoughts obey'd the moral sense, Whose heart possess'd Benevolence; But whose Philosophy would prove Superior to the Syren Love. He might a tender Father be, And deal forth deeds of Charity; In the strait Line of Duty move, But, never, never be in Love. Belinda was both rich and fair, Of hoarded Wealth the only Heir; And with such precious virtues fraught, No wonder she was fondly sought By many, anxious to receive The Happiness which she could give. A Colonel for her Favour sued, A Lawyer too the Maiden woo'd; A Parson hop'd the Prize to get, While a proud, well-bred Baronet, Who many a year had pass'd his heigh-day Wish'd much to make the Miss a Lady; A Quaker likewise came to try His Plainness and Simplicity: He knew she was a Girl of Whim, And thought that she might fancy him. A Doctor also join'd the Tribe, And he had ventur'd to prescribe Something that might his Patient suit, A Licence, and a Ring to boot. Belinda, all in silence heard, As each his diff'rent claim preferr'd: No look or word or smile had given The Hope of matrimonial Heav'n: The Lady's Philosophic sense Had not felt any Preference; And, on revolving many a scheme By which to wake and fix esteem, She thought it might be better done By personal Comparison. Hence she resolv'd to bring them all Before her, in her spacious Hall, And, to th'assembled groupe, relate Her notions of the Nuptial State; When each, as it might best beseem, Would gravely treat the solemn Theme; And, in the others presence, tell The points in which each might excel. —The plan once form'd, her resolution Brought it to instant execution. The Parties met, th'important Fair With grave demeanour, took the Chair, And to the wond'ring Folk address'd The secret Counsels of her Breast. “The reason why I call'd you here, “My worthy Friends, will soon appear; “Nor shall I words and time employ “Your friendly patience to annoy. “The suit which each of you preferr'd “I have, with due attention, heard, “As each, in secret and alone, “Express'd a wish to make it known: “But Suitors' vows when they are made, “In quiet room or bowery shade, “Are seldom with discretion weigh'd, “And oft are fashion'd to deceive “The Maid who ought to disbelieve. “Thus I've determin'd to resort “To something like an open Court, “Where no one, sure, will dare to tell “What watchful rivals may repel; “Or hide, by base, sophistic art, “The real dictates of the heart. “Thus I shall hear, what Female Youth “So seldom hears—th'unvarnish'd Truth. “—Know then, that I, who here preside, “The Tenour of your thoughts to guide, “Shall draw a strong and certain Line, “Which must your varying thoughts confine “Within the limits I ordain “The several Claimants to maintain.” “You all of you have sought to prove “That I'm an object of your Love. “The Colonel, by his am'rous story, “Loves me far more than martial Glory; “And, call'd to witness all the Stars, “That Cupid oft has vanquish'd Mars. “—The Lawyer, in more formal way, “With this I swear, and this I say, “I who ne'er yet have made a flaw “In any Instrument of Law— “I, who from my earliest youth “Ne'er sinn'd against the rigid truth, “Declare 'tis not for house or land, “That thus I ask your wedded hand;— “'Tis honest Love makes the demand. “—The Rector, with uplifted eyes “Offer'd of Love the sacrifice: “With chaste desire and passion pure “Which should for evermore endure. “—The Knight said, I was sweeter far “Than roses or than vi'lets are, “Then told the passion I inspir'd, “And flames with which his heart was fir'd. “—The Quaker said, the Spirit mov'd him, “And that he spoke as it behov'd him, “To tell me he was nothing loth “To love a Maid of comely growth; “That he believ'd my inward Grace “Equal'd the bloom upon my Face, “And that he no more wish'd to say “Than Yea was Yea—and Nay was Nay. “—The Doctor made me a Petition “That I would prove his kind Physician. “He said his Med'cines fruitless prove “To cure him of the pains of Love. “And then with sighs the learned Elf, “Implor'd me to prescribe Himself. “—But this same thing, which you call Love, “Is what I wholly disapprove; “And thus my purpose I reveal:— “The Man who doth this passion feel, “Shall never with Belinda wed, “Or share with her the Marriage Bed. “Poets and graver Prosemen tell us, “'Tis apt to make a Husband jealous; “Warms a fond Lover to be bold, “And in a married man grows cold. “—I, as a Wife, hope to possess “That tranquil, temp'rate Happiness, “Whose current may serenely flow, “Nor rise too high, nor sink too low. “In Nuptial bands, my wishes tend “To meet a kind and faithful friend, “Regard that glows, his heart may move, “But he must never think of Love.” “Thus, as you sit in sightly row, “You each may the pretensions shew, “By which my fav'ring choice you seek:— “Colonel, I call you first to speak.” The Colonel. “Madam, e'en from my youthful day, “I've learn'd the Lesson to obey,— “And now I pay submission due, “Proud that Command proceeds from You: “But Honour is the Soldier's boast, “He sinks to nought when that is lost: “For Truth and Honour are the same— “They only differ in the name. “The Man, who breaks his plighted word, “Ought not to wear his Country's sword, “And that which now bedecks my side, “Has ever been my darling pride: “Nor shall a word of mine defame “The Honour of a Soldier's name. “I shall not then with falsehood sue “Not e'en to be possess'd of You:— “I said I lov'd—and told you true. “And if my passion you reward, “This weapon shall your Beauty guard: “I'll crown you with a Soldier's wreath, “And fond and faithful prove till death. “But if my Love you should decline, “Belinda never can be mine.” The Lawyer. “As you instruct me not to Love, “And the Proceeding disapprove, “As, Lady, you exclaim, O fye on't,— “I'll act as if you were my Client, “And will, to my profession true, “A writ of Utlegatum sue, “And then, with all its Paramours, “Drive this same Passion out of doors:— “Thus, I presume, my Lady fair, “I shall by your Assignment share “The various Assets you possess; “And, if you crown my Happiness, “I'll bind your Lands in strict Entail, “Upon our Lawful Issue Male; “And will contrive to fence them round, “As safe as beast within a pound; “While no Replevin's busy rout “Shall e'er contrive to get them out. “But, if no Issue Male should prove “The Offspring of our mutual Love,— “—Curse on the word,—how could I make “Such an infernal, gross mistake! “The Devil himself must have unstrung “The practis'd caution of my tongue: “But think not I could e'er intend “To use a word that must offend; “Or that precise expression put, “Which you've thought wisely to rebut. “'Tis a Misnomer, I declare it, “And will not only say, but swear it. “I therefore hope, my Lady Judge, “You will not in your wisdom grudge “To let me thus amend my statement, “By instant arguing in abatement; “For Love was never seen or meant “In any Marriage Settlement “That I've been ever call'd to draw, “Nor is there such a word in Law. “It ne'er was found in all my reading, “Nor is it known in Special Pleading. “—Nay, when I mention'd it before, “Sitting beside your Green-house door, “I truly, Madam, meant no more “Than the affection and regard “Which are of Marriage the Award, “And, by fair, mutual Arbitration, “Prevent domestic Litigation. “And now, I trust, in time and place, “You'll be convinc'd I've prov'd my case; “No more my Title will dispute, “But tell me I have gain'd my Suit.” The Rector. “My much belov'd Parishioner, “I've heard the doctrines you prefer; “And scarcely think that you can wish “Thus to prepare the Nuptial dish, “Without th'ingredient, whose fine Zest “Gives such a relish to Life's Feast: “It almost makes me melancholy, “That any fine-drawn scheme of Folly “Should, by its influence, degrade “A mind for higher objects made; “And, by its whimsies strange, impair “Th'Attractions of a form so fair. “—Love is a pure, a sacred fire, “Not a mere sensual desire, “But, true to Virtue's calm controul, “Courts the best impulse of the soul; “A foe to all domestic strife, “And gilds the Charities of Life; “Divides each anxious, gloomy care, “And doubles ev'ry Joy we share, “While Laws, both human and divine, “To sanction all its rites combine. “Of our first parents 'twas the boast “Before their Innocence was lost, “And no more certain safeguard's known, “In mortal Life, to keep our own. “Most sacred are the Nuptial bands, “Which Heaven, in Holy writ, commands; “And Heaven, we're told, will ne'er approve “Of Marriage unrefin'd by Love. “Nor is Man more distinguish'd seen “From any Beast that treads the green, “From flying bird or creeping worm, “By speech, by reason, or in form, “Than by the secret springs which move “And wake his Heart to virtuous Love. “Beauty to your dear Sex was given “To form for Man an earthly Heaven: “But when an Angel's charms we view, “Such, Madam, as we see in you, “We ask an Angel's virtues too. “Yet, Beauty's but a fading flower, “That pleases only for an hour: “'Tis Virtue's Office to impart “Affection to the faithful heart, “Which, when the day of Youth is past, “Till the Knell tolls, will love and last:— “But, if the Fair that charms the sight “Should prove a treach'rous Hypocrite; “If the sweet Form so lovely seen “Should entertain a Devil within, “And such things, it is said, have been, “She, as some hapless men may tell, “Will turn the hop'd-for Heaven to Hell. “You smile,—though 'tis not to divert you “I speak my thoughts,—but to convert you, “And change your fancies, which are treason “Against Religion, Truth and Reason, “To those sound tenets which will prove “How weak to quarrel thus with Love. “O let me, let me then impart “The feelings of a tender heart; “O let me, the Physician be “To cure you of your Heresy. “The Church, enamour'd of your charms, “To you displays its longing arms, “And I, its Minister attend, “My fond, and pious aid to lend, “To lead you to the sacred spot, “Where Holy rites may tie the Knot, “With chaste desire and passion pure “Which shall throughout our lives endure, “Thus, with a renovated mind, “And your false notions left behind, “With me true happiness you'll prove, “And your whole Life be Joy and Love.” The Baronet. “Madam, a faithful Knight you see, “But who disdains Knight Errantry:— “That stuff and nonsense is no more, “The day of Chivalry is o'er. “I would not my fore-finger move “To mark the least respect for Love, “Since you the passion disapprove;— “Though I ne'er fail to pay my Duty “To such a sov'reign good as Beauty; “Believe me then, when I impart “That Love is banish'd from my heart; “That I'm prepar'd to pass my Life “In rend'ring you a happy Wife, “By those wise rules you've given to guide “Their claims who seek you for a Bride. “I'll take you from the Sylvan plain, “And place you where you're form'd to reign, “Where your superior Heart will prove “The seat of Honour, not of Love; “Where all those higher joys will wait, “Attendant on your crowded gate, “Which Heaven in its indulgence pours, “To suit a noble mind like yours. “—The moment you assume my name, “You will become a titled Dame, “And those obeisances receive “Which Birth alone knows how to give, “In all due fashion and degree, “To dignified Philosophy. “O with what splendour you'll appear, “When seated in your proper sphere: “Come then, and let me place you there. “In this retreat no longer stay, “But to enjoy the Nuptial Day. “Leave Cupid, and his boasted slaughters, “To Country clowns and Farmers' daughters; “And haste to the delights of Town, “Where the sly Rascal's scarcely known. “There, in whatever point you move, “You'll never see the Dæmon Love, “But as he may peep from a Carriage, “A week before, or after Marriage; “And of such short-liv'd humour savours, “As scarce out-lasts the marriage favours: “Ne'er will He your attention gain, “But to confirm your just disdain. “—When to the Circle you resort, “Be sure, you'll find no Love at Court: “If you pop forth to breathe the air, “In a Balcony in a Square, “No symptoms of the tender passion “Will you perceive,—'tis not the Fashion. “If to the Opera you repair, “And help to form the Splendour there, “Mention but Love, they all will flout it, “Though Catalani sings about it. “Then we will wed, if you approve, “Without one common type of Love: “No bells shall ring, no gaudy flower “Shall idly deck the solemn hour, “But we will instantly appear, “As married folks of half a year; “Nay, while I live, you may depend “Love shall not on our steps attend; “For to your ev'ry wish I'd bend;— “Not Plato's self would prove more true “To your Philosophy,—and You.” The Quaker. “The Spirit moves me to declare, “I think thee Friend, exceeding fair. “Thou'rt of good liking, I confess, “And the fresh bloom of Youth possess. “Nature has made thy figure strait, “And thou art modest in thy gait. “But though thou'rt pleasing to the eye, “I will not please by flattery; “But think the good old adage true “Of—handsome they who handsome do. “I upwards from my earliest youth “Have thought it right to speak the truth, “Nor ever will my mind disguise, “As some, I see,—by telling Lies. “—The Man of War, I'm feign to own, “Made his respectful wishes known, “As one, if I can clearly see, “Who would prove true to Love and thee: “But, if thou wilt from Reason range, “If thou wilt not thy Fancies change, “No man of tenderness and sense “Will e'er give thee the preference; “And it will be thy gold alone “That with an Husband makes thee one. “—I say no more than I pretend; “Mine is the Language of a Friend; “Untaught by Fashion or by Art, “I speak the dictates of the heart. “Yes, I could love thee, to be free, “In truth, and in simplicity; “But then thou must the vow maintain, “That I should be belov'd again: “The Woman who should scoff at Love, “Will ne'er, I'm sure, my Spirit move. “Thou talk'st with great disdain about it, “But what's a Husband's heart without it?— “Without it, I should think a wife “Would only be a plague for Life;— “She should not have my nuptial vow, “Though she were twice as rich as thou. “—The Man of War, I'm free to own, “Made his respectful offers known “As truth his wishes did impart, “Warm and ingenuous from the heart; “And, if I may his notions trust, “For I would feign to all be just, “Thy wealth will tempt him not to wield “His spear in Philosophic Field, “Darken'd with plants of dismal hue, “And where the Laurel never grew. “Thus, the brave Man of War, we see, “Doth with the Man of Peace agree, “In all things that relate to thee. “His thigh is girt with hostile sword, “My weapon is the peaceful word; “But still our thoughts appear the same, “Though in a diff'rent form and name. “—Decided, calm and unperplex'd, “My friend the Rector took his Text: “Love was the Theme, but not the Love, “That we are told, comes from above: “It rather seem'd to have a taint “Of the sly sinner than the Saint; “But as the learned Doctor reason'd, “Had it not been so highly season'd “With a rich, spicy, flattering spell, “It might be said—He reason'd well. “—My friend the Knight, I do confess “Talk'd much of Joy and Happiness; “But would it not be well to know “How far his promises may go? “For I have read as well as heard, “That on a Courtier's flowery word, “It is not prudence to rely “Without some good Security. “It now doth seem, that he doth see “All right which doth proceed from thee. “The notions in thy thoughts combin'd “Are strait reflected to his mind: “He bows to all that thou may'st say; “Thy Yea's his Yea,—thy Nay's his Nay. “Say that the Sun runs round the Moon, “Or midnight Stars shine bright at Noon, “He will, with some fine Compliment, “As to unerring truths assent. “But when the Wedding ring has bound, “With Magic power thy finger round, “And when thou'st said the word obey, “Tell me what will thy Champion say; “Or, to employ a term more true, “Tell me what will thy Champion do. “Think then, I pray thee, and attend “To the kind counsels of a Friend, “And if thy Fancy still commands “Love's absence from the Nuptial Bands, “Contrive that Prudence be thy guide “When thou resolv'st to be a Bride. “But if no reas'ning can remove “This strange antipathy to Love “E'en take th'Attorney for thy mate, “And thou may'st quickly learn to hate. “—My Friend the Doctor is preparing, “As I perceive, to gain a hearing: “Whether it be his skilful aim “Thy whims and follies to inflame, “Or, by some lulling, opiate draught, “To still thy fond, prevailing thought; “Or to prescribe a yielding Yea, “And take thy Fortune for a Fee, “I cannot tell;—but this I say, “In my plain, honest, simple way, “A better fate he would ensure thee, “If he would either kill or cure thee. “—Thus, having closed what I begun, “The Spirit moves me to have done.” He spoke, the Doctor to the ear Of the attentive Maid drew near, With due respect, to give the potion Of grave submission and devotion, When Death was seen, with stately air, To stand behind Belinda's Chair. He look'd, or seem'd to look, around, And cloth'd his words in hollow sound. “You may depart, the Contest's o'er; “Your rivalry exists no more: “She is not fit, strange Maid, to wed “With living wight, but with the dead: “I, therefore, seize her as my Bride.”— Belinda trembled, gasp'd,—and died. The Toastmaster. THE Dinner and its labours o'er, Bacchus unfolds his various store, The Ruby Juice, the mingled Bowl, To drown the sorrows of the Soul. —With ready step and blithsome air, The grave Toastmaster takes the Chair: The wine soon sparkled in the glass, And gladness beam'd in ev'ry face: When, to begin the scene of Glee, The King was given, with three times three; And may he live was echoed round, Till of high virtue may be found, In every realm, on every throne, Examples equal to his own. Then the gay guests their Bumpers ply To all the Royal Family. Nor were the wooden walls forgot: That they might never go to pot, But still sustain the Nation's fame, And give new splendor to its name, Re-echoed round the Oaken Table, While any votive voice was able. To these were join'd the martial Bands, Who, when their Country's call commands, To seek the hostile plains prepare, And plant the British Laurel there. But while the festive Goblets crown The brave and virtuous with renown, And shouts attend on Wellington, The bumper Curses loudly wait On the subdued Napoleon's Fate, As the wide sea he passes o'er, To trouble Europe's peace no more. Of Beauties then the num'rous Line Sweetens the copious draughts of wine. —And now, commanded by the power That rul'd the inebriating hour, Silence prevail'd:—Amid the smoke Of fuming pipes the Chairman spoke: “—My Friends, according to my thinking, “No pleasure is in Life like drinking; “It is the bottle and the bowl, “That gives true pleasure to the Soul, “And drowns each sullen, meddling care “That strives to take possession there. “While thus I sit, I know no strife, “Nor hear the Clamours of my Wife; “And, when our jovial Meeting's o'er, “Fearless I'll ope my mansion door, “And care not for the horrid din “That waits me when I enter in; “Laugh at her noise, and put off sorrow “To sober hours, and dull to-morrow. “—The brave Lieutenant, who sits there, “Forgets the unrewarded Scar, “And the bluff Major, waxing gay, “With Locks in toils of war grown grey, “Heeds not the pittance of his pay. “—The Squire, who pours his Liquor out, “Feels not he ever had the Gout, “And laughs at all the tort'ring pain, “Though it may threaten him again. “While thus we quaff, and laugh and sing, “Time flits with an unwearied wing; “But Bacchus every want supplies, “And gilds each moment as it flies. “But now a Toast I shall present, “Or what is call'd a Sentiment, “In which my Friends will all agree; “So fill each glass and drink with me. “—May we enjoy the power of drinking “Till we have lost the power of thinking!” He strove his Goblet to prepare, But sunk down senseless from his chair: Death enter'd then with grimly grace, And occupied the vacant place. Some at the strange appearance star'd, While others, by the Phantom scar'd, Let loose their Glass, but prov'd unable To hide their fears beneath the Table; Or, failing to find out the door, Stumbled and struggled on the floor. The Chairman gravely said, “I'm come “To lead some of you safely home: “But I propose one Bumper more, “And then the jovial Meeting's o'er.” “The End of Life's the Toast I give:”— “That's Drinking, Sir, as I conceive,” The 'Squire replied; “so fill my Glass, “And, prithee, let the Ladle pass. “The End of Life,” the Toper cries, Empties his brimming Cup,—and dies. The Careless and the Careful. ASK the Doctor, whose renown His skill has spread throughout the Town, Whose rolling Chariot's daily seen From Temple Bar to Lisson Green; Yes, ask him, if you know him well, And He the real Truth will tell, What's the complaint or the Disease That brings the largest heap of Fees: He'll tell you Folly is the Mine That feeds the Sons of Medicine. Intemperance, in whatever way It doth its various forms display, Whether, in Bacchanalian Hours, It overcomes the Reas'ning Powers; Or, gloting o'er the daily Feast, The Glutton sinks into the Beast; Whene'er it doth desire inflame, 'Tis Folly by another name. When sage Discretion's laid aside, That Passion may be gratified, We may forebode the coming ill That calls for Potion or for Pill. Is there a form in which excess Can minister to Happiness? No, 'tis, alas, a source of pain, Of pale Disease, and all its train. If the too frequent draughts you seek Which burn the palm and flush the cheek; If the too frequent Banquets press The Stomach with their Lusciousness;— If, shuning Nature, you invite Whate'er the pamper'd appetite Demands to gratify the taste, You'll quickly bring your health to waste. If, bred in Lux'ry's various schools, You mock at Nature's simple Rules,— Prepare the Fees;—for, soon or late The Galens will assail your gate. It is the Folly which opposes Wise Nature's way that calls for Doses: The Doctors would give up their System As gainless, did not Fools assist 'em. —Nature and Prudence, and Discretion Are doubtless of the same Profession; Their general object is the same; They differ little but in name; While Folly's ever seen to be A constant foe to all the three. —Whate'er may be the course of Life, Whether it leads to peace or strife;— Its way all safe or fill'd with snares, With pleasures gay or sad with cares;— Whether 'tis poverty or wealth, Or sickness pale or rosy health; By Reason sage we shall be blam'd, If of those powers so lately nam'd, We do not ask continual aid, Or old or young, or man or maid: Whate'er our Rank or our Profession, Nature and Prudence, and Discretion, Or in our station or our frame, Should in their influence be the same. Experience, in her ample school, Cannot provide a better rule; Yet we're too apt to play the fool. —Howe'er, it is not to the great, To those who live in Wealth and State, Or bustle in the busy strife That marks the active scenes of Life, To whom my Moral I display; But to the thoughtless and the gay: The wholesome subject pays its duty To giddy Youth and careless Beauty. Miss Mary, and her sister Sophy, Were seen to bear the envied Trophy Which Beauty's Queen, 'tis said, confers On certain favourites of hers: Nor will it, sure, be thought untrue That this the conscious Ladies knew: 'Twas nat'ral, therefore, the desire To go where gazing eyes admire: One Evening then, at Pleasure's call, They brought their Graces to a Ball: What Envy the fair Nymphs excited, How oft to dance they were invited, What admiration was bestow'd, What Love-sick Beaux around them bow'd, Are things the humble verse will leave For any Fancy to conceive; And Fancy may suppose, the night Gave a succession of Delight. But Pleasure's season must be o'er, And when the Band was heard no more, The Sisters sat them down to cool Their heated Forms and play the fool. They laughed at those who spoke their fright, As the loud Storm disturb'd the night, And Quizz'd the Carefuls as they bawl For Cloak and Fur and wrapping Shawl. —Their Coach was call'd, it was not come: “Ne'er mind,” they said, “we're so near home; “And it will be delightful Fun, “In such a night to have a run. “Come, Major, give us either arm, “We can skip on and take no harm: “Besides, your fierce cock'd Hat and Feather “Will, surely, save us from the weather. “The Care of such a gallant Fellow “Is better far than an Umbrella.” —They saw a Lanthern dance before To guide them onward to their door, But knew not who the Lantern bore. 'Twas Death, alas, who lit them home; And the Fool's Frolic seal'd their doom. The Law overthrown. IT is not easy to conceive, That social Law should e'er deceive; That what for our protection's made Should prove a pettifogging trade. Form'd on maxims just and true, Bearing Man's happiness in view, And in the clear distinction strong Of what is right and what is wrong; Yet it is made our lives to fill With sad varieties of ill; And thus the most opprobrious fame Attends upon the Attorney's name. —Nay, these Professors seem asham'd To have their legal title nam'd: Unless my observation errs They're all become Solicitors, A change that's now assum'd, we see, By all of the Fraternity. If they're oblig'd to advertise In the News-paper Diaries, 'Tis now the Fashion to refer To such a one—Solicitor, Ask an Attorney his Address, He will no more the name confess, And on his printed Card is seen Solicitor—in Street, or Inn, Though he had never got so high As one fat Suit in Chancery. —Unless the daily Prints deceive Attornies must for ever live; At least, no Paragraph supplies Th'account that an Attorney dies: Tis the Solicitors alone Whom they with deathly notice own. —But still distinction must be made Between the Classes of the Trade: For he who guides the wordy war That marks the Contests of the Bar, Where we oft hear superior sense Cloth'd in the brightest Eloquence, Must not partake the common feelings That wait upon th'Attornies' dealings. They are a class in ev'ry Nation Who live alone by Litigation; Who oft grow rich by working strife, And fatten on the Ills of Life. Whether 'tis Shakespeare, or Moliere, Johnson or Congreve, or Voltaire, Whatever Country's comic Stage Does the dramatic mind engage, Th'Attorney with degraded mien Appears to turpify the scene. Law in itself is just and good When it is practised as it should, And Lawgivers can ne'er intend What Justice never can defend. It therefore, very strange appears, That Clients should, for twenty years, With all appliances to boot, Be wading through a Chancery Suit; And, after twenty years are run, May gain their Suits, and be undone. —Still there are Men whese names rank high, Lawyers who may reproach defy, There's Redesdale and there's Romilly: Redesdale, who snatches from the claw Of the vile Harpies of the Law, The Debtor in his hopeless state, And opens wide the Prison gate: While Romilly, though oft in vain, Strives to correct the low Chicane That, by the Pettifogger's art, Keeps Law and Justice far apart. But still it is the Pleader's fate His reasonings to accomodate Not always to his own Belief, But to the Attorney's dubious Brief. And though his knowledge may cry fye o'nt, He turns and twists it for his Client; Nor will his Practice think it treason, To make the worse the better reason. Some Writer of our age and nation Has made the following observation: That Annals old the time display, When Priests bore universal sway; And nought was seen but spire and bower, The seats of their o'er-ruling power. But now the Lawyers seem to ride In a new form of power and pride. Some, though the numbers are not great, Are seen to rise to rank and state; While many, as it were by stealth, Creep on to figure and to wealth; Not as by chance, now here now there, They're known and noted every where. —As you pass through a country town, Ask, who doth the best mansion own; You're told 'tis Lawyer such a one. And the reply, rough and uncivil, May, perhaps, wish him with the Devil. —But still no groundless wrong is meant, I reason not with foul intent, I plead the general Assent: On those opinions rests the tale Which universally prevail. Lawyers, like other men, are made, 'Tis not their nature I upbraid; No,—'tis the nature of their trade, Which feuds create and quarrels bless, And whose chief dealing is distress. When their curs'd offices they quit, When out of sight of Bill or Writ; When they think not of Scire Facias, Nor Bailiff waits to take a Capias, Like men, in other occupations, They do the duties of their stations, And pass through Life with equal grace: Lawyer's not written in their face. —I wish 'twere otherwise, that Law Were practis'd without Quirk or Flaw; But while these Quirks and Flaws remain The Practice must reproach sustain. I've somewhere read, though I've forgot The Author who the Story wrote, Perhaps Quevedo here may claim The honour of the Author's name: But, though I can't precisely tell, The Narrative will do as well. Suffice it then, that it should seem, Some lively Sleeper had a dream, In which, as Fancy took its turn, He thought he was by Spirits borne To the terrific, vast Domain Where Satan holds his dismal reign. But it were needless to describe The flaming pomp, the sable tribe Which on th'infernal Sov'reign wait, Compose his train and form his state. The Devil, however, did his best, And graciously receiv'd his Guest; Then drove him, in a Tandem, round His awful Kingdom's ample bound. So swift he went there was no need To urge the Dragons' rapid speed. He then display'd the parts assign'd To different classes of Mankind, Whose Spirits, borne on Fate's dark pinions, Are daily peopling his Dominions. At length they reach an arid space Which crags and sulph'rous thorns deface, Where the weak, dazzled, mortal eye Could not discern the Boundary. When, as the livid Lightnings flam'd, The Dreamer thought that he exclaim'd— “This Plain's of an enormous size,” “But not too large,” the Devil replies: “For no Attorney e'er drew breath “Who will not dwell there after death; “And all who live in times to come, “Will find the same allotted doom, “Unless a change yet unforseen, “Should, in their practice, intervene: “While, in a smoking vale behind, “Some of their Clients are confin'd, “Who in their various trickings join'd; “And they, at seasons, to amuse 'em, “Are there permitted to abuse 'em.” When, as he spoke, such horrid noises Were utter'd by their mingled voices, That the poor Dreamer's sleep was broke, And glad he was when he awoke. But some, who've been reputed wise, Explain dreams by their contraries: In fact, these visions of the Night, May be, by chance or wrong or right; And this same dream may prove as well, The Attornies never go to Hell; As by the simple meaning given, That these same folks ne'er go to Heaven, But yet, perhaps, without pretence, To more than common, mother sense, We may the knotty point determine As well as Judges clad in ermine. Let us suppose that Power supreme, Where-ever placed, should form a scheme That, if in Equity or Law, A Suit by any Trick or Flaw, By any counterfeit contrivance, Of crafty plea, or sly connivance, Should last beyond four Terms, at most, Th'Attornies should pay all the Cost. Then, that the power of Legislation Should ask the voice of all the Nation Whether the change, well understood, Would not be found a public good? Now, when this question were afloat, How, say you, would the Attornies vote? Would they, like honest men and true, Keep right and Justice in their view, Or think 'twould hurt the Revenue: And, therefore, for th'Exchequer's sake, They must th'opposing party take. But this I leave to the decree Of those who wiser are than me. O that sage, Serjeant Brawl were here, To try and make the question clear! But he is gone I know not where. —Full fifty thousand cases load, As it is said, the British Code, Compil'd in Judgments, call'd Reports Which dictate to the puzzled Courts; From these he could collect a string, And to aid any reasoning bring; While, to oppose it o'er and o'er, He could find out as many more. But he has met a sudden Fate, Near Rufus' Hall wide op'ning gate. A Hackney Chariot waited there, To take him home to Bloomsb'ry Square. Death mounts the Box and plies the thong, The angry horses dart along:— The wheels a Paviour's barrow meet, Brim full of stones to mend the street To stop, th'affrighted Serjeant calls, And, as the o'erturning Carriage falls, “I'll bring an Action,” loud he cries,— Fate to the stones his head applies;— The Action's brought—The Serjeant dies. The Fortune Teller. IT has been said, that Man, by Nature, Is but a superstitious Creature. If I err not, 'twas Burke's opinion, And he may seem to claim dominion, As a Philosopher and Sage, In this illuminated age, Which his superior mind adorn'd, And through whose years he will be mourn'd; Nor in what doth to Man belong, Am I dispos'd to think him wrong, —If we look through th'historic page, And travel on from Age to Age, It will to our research appear, As the Meridian Phœbus clear What notions strange, Men have conceiv'd What contraries they have believ'd: In ev'ry time, 'neath ev'ry sky, We see the same Credulity. The Pagan Augurs swore they knew Why Birds or this or that way flew; And Oracles proclaim'd the Law To keep the vulgar Folk in awe, While the keen Conj'rors of the State Assum'd to know the will of Fate. The monkish Ages then succeed, Govern'd by superstition's creed, When mystic men in holy robe, O'er-run one quarter of the globe:— Nay, in this most enlighten'd Age, So philosophic and so sage, When Knowledge is so much the rage, E'en now we see the human mind, On many strange occasions blind: Not when she chuses to dispense Her pleasures to each diff'rent sense, But, as she in her fancy varies, Her idle whimsies and vagaries. How many cheeks will now turn pale At hearing of the Goblin's tale! How many tremble with affright At dreams that have perplex'd the night! A Raven's croak, a Magpie's chatter, To numbers is a serious matter; And when abroad they think to roam, Will check their steps and turn them home. How many Matrons daily see The grounds of Fate, in grounds of Tea! If fair Maria breaks a glass, She's sure some ill will come to pass; But, if the Salt, by chance she spills, She then foresees a thousand ills: Though, for her comfort, she grows bolder, When she has thrown it o'er her shoulder. —Lay knives across upon a table, It will some appetite disable: Check the digestion of the meat, And spoil the pleasures of a treat. —If a poor Dog tied up at night, Perchance should howl, it shakes with fright The Nurse who sits by Sick-man's bed, As a Knell tolling for the dead. E'en Gipsies still pursue their trade, And daily get their vagrant bread, By boasting the pretence to be Skill'd in the arts of Palmistry: Ay, still what num'rous fools are known To learn their Fate of Norwood's Crone. —Thus in our bright, instructive day, When Science rules with potent sway; When Knowledge ev'rywhere expands And gets into so many hands; When Reason claims its widest reign, The whims of Folly still remain; And Hope and Fear, in constant strife, Continue to embarrass Life. Soothsayers have been long at rest, And Oracles are now a jest: We think not that the Comet brings The overthrow of Thrones and Kings: Nor, as of old, view with despair, The progress of the wond'rous star; Yet still, how often we apply The workings of Credulity, And calculate on Horoscopes, To calm our Fears, or wake our Hopes: 'Tis Weakness, Folly, what you will; But the vain search is practis'd still; Or wherefore is it so well known, That, in each corner of the Town, Some artful, knavish Rascal dwells, Who, with grave aspect, Fortunes tells; While, to each List'ner he pretends That He and Fate have long been Friends; And, by his Art, he can unlock it, As easily as pick a pocket. —To satisfy, while Reason's blind, The whimsy of the erring mind That doth in some weak moment, brood, O'er fear of ill, or hope of good, 'Tis known that scarce a day is past But some fair Maiden's Lot is cast; Or tender Damsel seeks to prove, What is to be her Fate in Love. Or eager Spendthrift doth apply To know when his old Sire will die: Or Miser bribes him to be told That he shall long enjoy his gold; While he to know doth humbly crave, If Coin is current in the Grave. As I've been told, the other day, Two Ladies did a visit pay, With a Bank Note and their Petitions, To one of these self-dubb'd Magicians, Possess'd of a low, crafty sense, Sustain'd by force of Impudence, And dealing out the will of Heaven According to the price that's given. For Ladies of the Higher Sort, Either from Folly or for Sport, Will visit, cloak'd up in disguise, These Emperics in Prophecies, To laugh at, or believe their lies. In large arm'd Chair this Merlin sate, Prepar'd to sell the will of Fate; And forming Packets from the sky, For any Fools who came to buy. The subtle Knave was well array'd In all the Costume of his Trade, With sable Gown, and Cap well furr'd, The potent Wand, and flowing Beard. Above an Alligator hung, Beneath a range of Orbs was strung; While, on a Globe, to aid the cheat, Grimalkin occupied a seat; For the unconscious mewing beast Was thought to be a Witch at least. Hither the curious Ladies went, Upon their timorous errand bent; Trembling their Story they relate, Then wait in awe to know their Fate: When thus the solemn Cunning Man His grave, mysterious speech began. “To me all Fate, all Fortune's known.” When it was said, in hollow tone, “Vain boaster—can you tell your own?” 'Twas Death who spoke:—Behind the Chair He did his fatal Scheme prepare. The magic mumm'ry fell around, And Globes and Spheres bestrew'd the ground. —Weigh'd down by falsehoods, fraud and lies, The howling Fortune-teller dies. The Lottery Office. AMONG the passions that infest The region of the human breast, That which enjoys the longest reign, Is known to be the Love of Gain. —The Zest for pleasure oft decays E'er Man has witness'd half his days; Ambition too as oft is fled, E'er the hair whitens on the head; Nay, the inspiring meed of Fame, Is oft'times thought an empty name, E'er Health has ceas'd its crimson glow, Or Time with care has mark'd the brow. But Love of gain will ne'er depart, When once it seizes on the heart: But waits on Life, in ev'ry stage, From Youth e'en to the dregs of Age. —All look with horror on the vice That bears the name of Avarice; And yet it takes the worser name When it becomes the Love of Game, In the high ranks of Life what ruin, What hurry to their own undoing, What vain remorse, we daily see, The fruits of this propensity. But 'tis not in the Club alone The heedless Gamester is undone. 'Tis even seen among the Classes Of Liv'ried Lads, and Toilette Lasses. Tyburn will tell that ruin flows As rapidly from Little Goes; And Lotteries too oft supply Cargoes for Bay of Botany. —'Tis not for those who deal in Rhyme, Up to the Statesman's desk to climb, Or else, 'twould be a willing task Of some Financier just to ask— Whether these Games, for Games they are, Though fram'd by Legislative Care, When by the moral vision view'd Do not produce more harm than good; And, to the lower ranks supply A tempting Lure to Villainy. 'Twas Mary's case:—Poor Mary came To serve a fashionable Dame, And never fail'd to do her duty In waiting on the shrine of Beauty: But, from some whimsy of her own, E'er she had liv'd a year in Town, Mary was prone to entertain This idle Fancy in her brain;— That, e'er she had out-run Life's Heyday, She should herself become a Lady. For she had Beauty, as she knew, And her red cheeks, and eyes so blue Had given a colour to the Line Of many a flatt'ring Valentine. Besides, at any romping Ball In Steward's Room, or Servant's Hall, Mary was thought to bear the Bell In smiling sweet and dancing well. A Gipsey, also, had foretold Some glut of unexpected Gold; And, among other flatt'ring Lies, Had hinted at some golden prize, From Fortune in the Lotteries. In this fond Hope, her wages went, And fruits of cast-off gowns were spent: Nor was this all,—for many a Loan, From the Blue Balls, was fled and gone: But though no kind returns were made In this unprofitable Trade; Hope yet remain'd.—One trial more Might, all that she had lost restore: While at each corner of the Street, Her eyes some golden promise meet. —Few thoughts, 'tis seen, alas, suffice To urge the mind that's bent on vice. And, to trip doubting Virtue's heels, Old Harry no compunction feels:— He thus suggested to poor Mary— “You now your fav'rite point will carry, “If you can get the Number bright “Of which you dream'd the other night.” “I know it well, as I'm alive,” Says she, “'twas Number Fifty Five.” —Thus fill'd with Hope, she risk'd her fame, And the rich Gem—an honest name, By vent'ring on foul Fortune's game. My Lady's Key the means supplies That guards the splendid Draperies, Which waited in the scented press Till Fashion open'd their recess. These she thus ventur'd to purloin And soon produc'd the purchas'd coin. Now Mary thought this could not be, In fact, a real Robbery, As they were all to be restor'd The moment Fortune kept her word. Which seem'd to be, so well assur'd, When the bright Number was procur'd. —Hope did alive her spirits keep, Though Fear had sometimes murder'd sleep, Till the day came that would reveal The awful Mysteries of the Wheel. She sought the Oracles who sate T'unfold the Billets-doux of Fate, And ask'd her Lot; when Death appear'd Behind the Desk, and strait uprear'd His fleshless hand, in which was seen A word of most terrific mien, To which she trembling turn'd her head, 'Twas Blank the pale Advent'rer read. “Then I must go, for all is gone, “But where,—an outcast and undone. “To madness only can I fly “To lose a greater misery.” “—From the sharp pangs of this sad hour, “From Fortune's disappointing power, “Thou art reliev'd;” the Spectre said.— —Mary was numbered with the Dead.— The Prisoner discharged. WHENE'ER the fatal Arrow flies And some high-favour'd Mortal dies; Whene'er we hang o'er Beauty's bier; Sorrow awakes the flowing tear. 'Tis not in Nature thus to part From those whose virtues warm'd our heart; From those whose charms were form'd to move The melting soul to purest Love, Without the bosom's keen distress Which no words tell, no looks express: But when the wretch pours forth the groan That says—“I've laid my burden down;” When wicked men from troubling cease, And the long-wearied rest in peace; When Mercy calls us forth to see Death set the hopeless pris'ner free, We bless the inviolable doom, And hail the Asylum of the tomb. Thank Heaven, the Debtor, though so late, No longer shares the Felon's fate; No longer by the Laws' delays, May be imprison'd half his days: No longer is the prison made The Harbour of that cruel trade Which fed the insatiable maw Of hungry, pettifogging Law: The imprison'd Debtor now may see The due approach of Liberty: From Redesdale's patient, patriot care, He now no longer need despair; No longer writhe beneath the Paw Of griping Harpies of the Law: But in the Prison's transient gloom, May look for better times to come. Redesdale, in thy great work, proceed! Freedom will hail thee for the deed, And doubt not, but each future age Will bless the Patriot and the Sage. But e'er the bold, correcting hand Of Justice did, with mild command, Sweep from the Law the petty powers That curtail'd Freedom's rightful hours, And bid th'unfortunate Pris'ner see The end of his Adversity;— —While yet the Iron Doors could close Upon the Pris'ner and his woes, And keep him fast for many a year, With scarce an hope his heart to cheer, Poor Morton, a sad tale to tell, For all who knew him, lov'd him well. Victim of Perjuries and Lies, The base Attorney's trickeries, And all the dark, insidious arts Which Knaves employ on gen'rous hearts, Within those walls became immur'd, Where so much sorrow is endur'd. His friends prov'd kind, and in his need, There was no want of gen'rous deed; But Friendship's self, with all its power, Could not advance fair Freedom's hour: Thus, when three years had pass'd away In Lawyers' frauds, in Laws' delay, His spirit could no longer wait; He call'd on Death to close his Fate:— The Spectre led him through the Gate. When, as he pass'd the Prison Door, Old Capias rail'd, and storm'd and swore, Revil'd Death as an arrant Cheat, Who did his writs and tricks defeat, And could the hopeless Pris'ner free From all his practic'd Sorcery. But Morton's gone to that bless'd Heaven, Where sins, like his, will be forgiven; Where all Afflictions will be o'er, And suffering Virtue sigh no more: While Capias, and the unfeeling brood, Who diet on the Heart's best blood, And feed on Sorrows, will despair Of ever finding entrance there. The Gallant's Downfall. WHEN sated Glory digs the Grave Where Vict'ry's flaunting banners wave, We croud around the Hero's bier, And grateful shed the patriot tear; While public grief prepares the tomb, Where laurels will for ever bloom. But when War's clam'rous clangors cease, And, in the tranquil home of peace, The Soldier calmly yields his breath To the resistless power of Death, In dirges due and sad array, He's borne along the Church-yard way, And by his Grave no more is said Than sanctifies the vulgar dead. —If the brave man whom Fortune spares, Amid the dang'rous din of Wars, Should chance, in frolic ease, to die By any common casualty; If all his vital powers should cease By bursting of a Fowling Piece, Or, if inclin'd to play the fool By vent'ring on th'half-frozen pool, And spite of Caution's sage advice, Should find a grave beneath the Ice, The termination of his story Is so unlike Heroic Glory, That some are apt to play the Fool By turning it to ridicule. But such was the young Hero's fate Whose tale these pages will relate. He was as brave as the keen sword Which, to his honour, kept its word: For oft as was its shining blade In battle's bloody scene display'd, The trembling foe was made to feel The vengeance of the fatal steel. —But when War's noble feats were done, A thrifty praise was all he won, With promise at some future day That he should get a Captain's pay. Thus, He was forc'd to sit him down In Quarters in a Country Town; Where, having nothing else to do, A Country Miss he chose to woo, She was th'impatient daughter fair Of a retired Officer, Who had a Col'nel's rank acquir'd, And, still with martial honour fir'd, Had made his purpose understood, Through all the chatt'ring neighbourhood, No Subaltern his girl should wed, Or e'er ascend her marriage bed: He should a Major be at least, Whom she should join in Hymen's feast. But the Lieutenant had contriv'd By arts which often-times have thriv'd, The fair Maria to persuade, Who was a kind, susceptive maid, To chaunt the burden of the Song, That—“Papas oftentimes are wrong.” The Gard'ner too had lent a key To aid the Son of Chivalry, By which, at the appointed hour, He could approach Love's sacred bower: A Ladder too, both strong and tall, Was always left against the wall, By which th'Heroic Swain could clamber With ease, into the Lady's Chamber. There we suppose the moments flew As quickly as they're apt to do, When tender Lovers steal an hour To weave a wreath for Hymen's bower, And they had hop'd they should be seen, Within a week, at Gretna Green. But Fate, that's oft a Foe to Love, Did not, it seems, the plan approve; And, as it oft has done before, Left a fair Maiden to deplore. The clock struck Ten,—with stately tread, The Col'nel sought his feather bed: When, as he pass'd, his watchful ear Did some unusual bustle hear. Betty, who held the light, and knew That his suspicions might be true, Said—“La, Sir! 'tis the cats that squall “As they run on the Garden wall.” “Then,” he replied, “I'll stop their squalling, “And quickly spoil their cat-a-walling: “So hold your tongue, and make no fuss, “I'll take my little Blunderbuss: “Whoe'er they are, I hope to fright “The rascals from their sport to-night.” So on he march'd in martial state, And boldly pass'd the Garden gate; When he took post behind a tree To form some dire catastrophe;— Though the dark mantle of the night Veil'd all things from his dizzy sight. In the mean time the Hero came, Burning with Love's all-daring flame, And had the ready ladder found; But e'er he reach'd the upper round, Grim Death, who, in a spiteful mood, Watching beneath the window stood, With ready power backward threw The Ladder and the Lover too, Who tumbled headlong in the pond, Stuck in the mud and soon was drown'd, Just as the fatal work was done The Col'nel fir'd his Evening Gun. “Save him,” was poor Maria's cry, “Or I shall burst with agony.” Her Sire replied—“Save him, save what! “If I've kill'd ought, it is a Cat. “So get you gone, and go to bed, “And drive these terrors from your head.” Nor was it long e'er Betty cheers The weeping Maid.—“Dispel your fears: “For we have search'd the Garden round, “And not a creature's to be found. “I think he's safe from all this riot, “And in his Quarters snug and quiet; “But should he wounded be, and die, “Why need you, Madam, sob and sigh: “Lovers in plenty will be found “When the Lieutenant's under ground. “He was an handsome man, 'tis true, “But not half good enough for you. “Poor as he was, had you been married, “Your scheme, I fear, would have miscarried. “My Master would have stamp'd, and swore “That he would never see you more; “And left you both to fast and pray “On Love, and a Lieutenant's pay. “But be th'event or right or wrong, “Calmly submit—and hold your tongue.” The morning came, the Pond display'd The poor advent'rous Soldier dead, And Miss was waken'd to recite The Lesson of the over-night; When, with pale looks, she view'd the scene, And wonder'd what it all could mean: While the good people gape and stare, And all exclaim,—“How came he there?” —The Col'nel, though ne'er bred at College, Would boast of his superior knowledge; And was the Oracle well known Of ev'ry Club about the Town. All were prepar'd his thoughts to hear, And thus he fill'd each list'ning ear. “Had you e'er been where I have been, “And had you seen what I have seen, “You would have guess'd, as well as me, “The cause of this Catastrophe. “The poor Lieutenant was as gay “And frolicsome as birds in May: “Time, says the song, is on the wing, “And Youth's the Age to laugh and sing. “He fledg'd his maiden sword in Spain, “Nor did he draw it forth in vain; “And 'twas a Spanish trick he play'd “To give my Girl a serenade:— “I've done the same when I was young, “And to some Nymph by star-light sung: “Thus, hoping to amuse my Daughter, “The Gallant fell into the water. “'Twas a scheme after dinner form'd, “And hence my garden has been storm'd: “He, doubtless, had o'ercharg'd his glass, “And this mishap has come to pass. “A tear ne'er fills the Soldier's eyes, “When on the plain a Soldier dies: “To the heroic and the brave “The Battle's field is Glory's grave; “But when this Boy in youth's fair flower “Finds in a pond his final hour, “I'm forc'd to feel the ridicule, “That He should die so like a Fool.” The Church Yard Debate. IS there a point in which we see That men of every rank agree? Is there a point which none dispute, And which no reas'ning can confute, 'Tis this, of motives sure the best, When well explain'd—Self Interest. —If to be happy is the view Which all mankind through life pursue, The way is plain, when understood; 'Tis nothing more than to be good; 'Tis Honour, Virtue, and the part Which marks a truly honest heart; 'Tis this completes the social plan That forms the Happiness of Man. Such is the wise unerring rule, The Doctrine of the Christian School. Man his best Interest thus pursues, When banishing all narrow views, All objects to himself confin'd, He looks at large to human kind. First, to his kindred and his friends, To neighbours then his virtue tends, And, op'ning wide the vast embrace, At length enfolds the human race. Such the firm Joy that Life bestows, Such the best cure for mortal woes. But there are those, the verse must own, Who think upon themselves alone; Whose self-regard we must express By the foul name of selfishness: A low, base, envious, glutton vice, That general kind of Avarice, Which, careless of all social ties, In one dark narrow circle lies: And 'tis this feeling which the verse, Such as it is, must now rehearse. One afternoon a Country Vicar Regal'd, with his best, foaming liquor, A Doctor by his skill renown'd For many a mile the country round, And a practitioner of Law, Of whom that Country stood in awe. They gossip'd on the affairs of state, Laugh'd at the follies of the great, And prov'd, by various illustration, That the times wanted reformation; And each of them, by turns, was sure He could all Public Evils cure. —Thus, as they pass'd away the hour, The Bell from the adjoining tower Gave notice by its sullen roar That some poor mortal was no more. 'Squire B? is gone, the Vicar said, And comes to join the num'rous dead Who in the Parish Church-yard lie, Sad scene of frail mortality. —The Doctor smil'd—“So let it be “Hatband and scarf, and gloves and fee, “Will well, my Friend, your pains repay “In mingling him with common clay.” —The Parson, looking grave, replied— “He was your patient till He died; “And I receive the poor remains “Of all the Doctor's daily gains. “You, by the living, get your bread, “I get a trifle by the dead; “But here's a Lawyer, nothing loth, “Contrives to profit by them both. “I shall plead guilty to the bill,” The Lawyer said:—“I made the Will “Of this same 'Squire—God rest his soul, “For whom this thund'ring Bell doth toll: “Let's to the Church-yard then proceed, “And there the Instrument I'll read, “In which some whimsies will appear “That may surprize you both to hear: “'Tis hot, and tombs are cooler far “Than these red, well-stuff'd cushions are.” The proposition met assent, And to the Church-yard strait they went; But, when the curious party found, Upon the consecrated ground, Death and the Sexton, in high glee, Discoursing on Mortality, The Lawyer made a sudden start; But, seeing Death without his Dart, And when, besides, he haply saw A friendly pipe within his Jaw, “Come on,” he said, “and make no fuss, “I'm sure he'll do no harm to us: “So take your seats, and I'll proceed “In what I promis'd you to read.” He then went through, in Lawyer's guise, A long detail of Legacies, And learnedly explain'd the Laws On which he fram'd each binding clause; When, having travell'd through the Will, He enter'd on the Codicil, And begg'd the Doctors to attend To the strange Humour of their Friend. “I leave to him, whoe'er he be, “Who in my last Infirmity, “Did on my hopeless bed attend, “As a Physician and a Friend, “The sterling sum of Fifty pounds, “Or Guineas, if it better sounds.” “That's me, by Jove,” the Doctor said: “I left him not till he was dead.” “—And the like sum to him who pray'd “Beside my Couch, and duly paid “Those solemn rites, when mortals lie “In passing Life's extremity.” “That's me,” the Parson then exclaim'd, “As clearly as if I had been nam'd:— “I say—He was of men the best, “And now resides among the blest:— “We all must reach our final home;”— When some one cried—“we all are come:” And Lo, the Hearse, in funeral state, Drew up before the Church-yard gate. Soon in the ground the 'Squire was laid, And ev'ry requiem sung or said. When, as a Herald throws his Stave, Death threw his Pipe into the Grave. The Good and Great. LORD Roland, 'mong the good and great, Had long maintain'd in honour'd state, The calm renown which Virtue gives, And lasts when Life no longer lives. In early years the manly scar Display'd his bravery in war: Nor did maturer age conceal His Labours for the Public weal. At length fatigu'd with active life, The world's gay throng and busy strife, He sought, as a serene retreat, The shades of his Patrician seat; Long there he liv'd almost ador'd, For ev'ry Vassal lov'd his Lord. Within the Mansion's stately hall, The hospitable Virtues all Display'd their bounties from a store That charm'd the rich, and fed the poor: Peace beam'd upon the wide domain, And smiling toil enrich'd the plain. Here Roland from the world remov'd By young and old, by all belov'd, Enjoy'd that animated rest By which the good alone are blest: Nor had his noble mind a care But for the virtues of his Heir. He had no Son—He lost the Boy Who once had been his darling joy; The Youth had measur'd Life's short span, E'er He had reach'd the Age of Man, And left the Titles which had run, For many an age, from Sire to Son, And all their Heritage, to grace The Scions of a distant race. At length, the proud illustrious Tree, Emblazon'd with its Ancestry, And all its bright heraldic fruit Was seen to perish at the root: Time plied his Scythe, and Death his Dart, The leaves decay'd in ev'ry part, And the last flow'ret ceas'd to bloom When Roland sought the silent Tomb: He, with his brave forefathers slept, And the surrounding country wept. Such grief profound had seldom been In Roland-hall, or felt or seen, As on the much-lamented day, When, in Death's proud but sad array, Its virtuous Lord was borne in state, For ever, from its ancient Gate. The dismal Spectre march'd before, And his grim Scull the plumage bore, While gazing folk their loss deplore. The sable train the rites attend, And all lament their common Friend: Such the best Honours that await The Funeral of the good and great. The next Heir. WHAT sudden changes do we see, What wonderful Variety, In all that passes here below, From Grief to Joy, from Joy to Woe! How oft do the transitions seem The rapid movements of a dream: But no where does the change appear So oft within one fleeting year; So oft display the motley mien As in the pantomimic scene Which Fashion, by her magic power, Forms to enliven every hour. Jack Dashall, who was so well known In every public place in Town, On whose Barouche and high-bred bays The Youngsters did with envy, gaze;— Should it be ask'd where Jack is fled, Or if He's number'd with the dead, Or wherefore we no longer meet The gayest lounger of the street? Why—He is lounging—in the Fleet. Aspasia made three winters gay, With Dance and Song, and Feast and Play: To the first Ton she op'd her doors: Lit up her room, and chalk'd her floors: Of Figure and Profusion proud, She welcom'd all the titled crowd, And thought herself supremely paid By all the flatt'ring things they said. But ah—extinct is all her Fame, And Fashion never speaks her name. The House is let, the Dame is flown, And Pleasure's gay Regalia gone, While she in distant Village pines, And on a vulgar chicken dines: When, to exasperate her Lot, She hears that she is quite forgot; That no one thinks upon the pleasure In which she wasted all her treasure. But I've another change to tell, Which a despairing Rake befel: Who, as he welter'd in distress, Was rais'd to instant happiness. One morn, as on his restless bed, Lord John reclin'd his aching head, While sleep refus'd th'oblivious power To add another drowsy hour: Of Bonds, Post Obits, all the trade On his resenting Mem'ry play'd; While all those missile papers storm His yielding fears in ev'ry form, With which the gaunt Attornies threat Those who are over-charg'd with debt; While not another Jew in Town Would lend his Lordship half-a-crown. There He remain'd but ill at ease, Watch'd by Law's base Satellites, Smiling Distress, and prompt to seize. Thus, as he on his pillow lay, Pondering the Journals of the Day, Fred'rick, his faithful Valet came, And, breathless, scarcely could exclaim “Great news, my Lord!—Your cares are past, “And Cousin Roland's kind at last.” “How is he kind?” was the reply. “Why—he has been so kind to die.— “Now, now, my Lord you need not fear “Lawyers or Bailiffs:—you're a Peer, “With twice ten thousand pounds a year. “Simon, the Steward, is below, “Who hurries up to Town, to know “What orders you may please to give; “And when the Hall is to receive “Your presence, that he may prepare “Each Honour due to Roland's Heir.” —Up rose my Lord, and scarce believ'd The welcome tidings He received. When Simon came, and bow'd full low While his old eyes with tears o'erflow. “Ne'er mind, my Boy,” his Lordship said, “Old Roland then, at length is dead: “But that must be the fate of all, “Of old and young, of great and small. “It is not half an hour ago, “My heart was so brimful of woe, “That as I lay upon my bed “I wish'd a bullet in my head. “But, truce to whimp'ring and crying, “Thank Heaven, I think no more of dying; “And while I live, be sure I'll strive “To keep old Roland Hall alive. “But first I want ten thousand pound;— “That sum, good Simon, must be found, “Though you should rob the Country round. “My present wants most loudly crave it. “For let me tell you—I must have it; “And if you can't the money find, “You're not a Steward to my mind; “Though, if you to my wants attend, “You'll find me a most gen'rous friend. “So not a word—but hasten down, “As quickly as you came to Town;— “And let the country neighbours all, “Within a month, expect a Ball, “In a high style, at Roland Hall.” —With aching heart, and shaking head, Lamenting his old Master dead, Old Simon sought his distant Home, Foreboding little good to come. —Nor was it long e'er the young Peer Set off, to enter on the Sphere Which now was his, already vain Of Titles old and rich Domain. With fury tow'rds the Hall he drove, The Tandem hurried through the Grove, Attended by the mingled noise Of Horns and Hounds, of Men and Boys; But, as his Tenantry await, To see him pass the Mansion Gate, Death, on the foremost Horse was seen, With eager look and 'vengeful mien, And seem'd to say, “The Hatchment view, “Vain Boy, for it may serve for you.” The Chaise was high, the Gate was low, His Head receiv'd the fatal blow From the rude arch;—He loos'd the rein, And fell, no more to rise again. —Thus, as Joy brighten'd Sorrow's gloom, He sunk, untimely, to the Tomb. But ah, those Sorrows did not wait Upon his unexpected Fate, Which mourn'd Lord Roland good and great. The Chamber War. THAT Man with Man is prone to jar, That Life is but a Scene of War, Hobbes, a known Sage, with learning fraught, Has, in a former cent'ry taught, And when the Scenes of Life we view, We might believe his maxim true. For, turning from the hostile rage Which Hist'ry gives of ev'ry age, And offers, to the pitying eye, The Horrors of that Deity; Whose lightnings have so oft been hurl'd To thin and terrify the world, We can't deny the daily strife That interrupts domestic Life, In every Form, in every State From Grosv'nor Square to Billingsgate, And sometimes proves, as I shall tell, A Prelude to the Passing Bell. Sir Samuel, as it appears, Had reach'd the Age of four-score years, Lame, weak and deaf, and almost blind, To his arm-chair He was confin'd: But while there's Life, there's Hope, they say; And three Physicians every day, Came, gravely, for their daily pay. A Nurse too, who her labours plied In watching sick men till they died, Had all that time, and longer, been The Mistress of the Chamber Scene. She did the Sick man's food prepare, And nurs'd him with unwearied care. She long had seen, for well she knew, That Med'cine there had nought to do: That drugs and potions would but tend To hasten Life's declining end, When the enfeebled, sinking frame Could scarce put forth a quiv'ring flame: But still the Doctors came each day, And bore their golden Fees away. They, day by day, when gravely seated, Order'd their Draughts to be repeated; Or, to give 'semblance to their skill, Chang'd these same Draughts into a Pill. But, when the three sage men were gone, She turn'd the Med'cines, every one, Into some place that might secure Their passage to the Common Sewer. She then the useless Drugs supplied With Kitchen Physic, which her pride Did, with experienc'd skill, provide. All know, in family concerns, Some curious ear for ever learns The passing secrets that prevail, And works them up into a Tale; Which, though first whisper'd, will, at length, Of loud report gain all the strength. Thus were the Doctors taught to curse The bold intrusions of the Nurse, Who had presum'd to doubt their knowledge, And practise Treason 'gainst the College; Which chang'd the Chamber's solemn quiet Into a scene of rout and riot. The Dons complain'd—the Nurse replied, And her whole conduct justified: Nay, some there are, in Med'cine's spite, Who think th'old Woman's doctrine right. Hard words alone, the strife began, But soon to blows the contest ran. At once, were Canes and Fists uprear'd, Bed-pans and Clyster-pipes appear'd; While John, with pugilistic art, Prepar'd to take the Nurse's part. Phials and Wigs, in the uproar, Were scatter'd all about the floor. —The Patient cries, What's this strange scene? Say, what can this disturbance mean? Your noisy words my pains increase: I pray you—let me die in peace. O friendly Death, thy aid I crave, I ask for peace, within the Grave! Death soon appear'd behind his chair, And softly whisper'd in his ear— “While these strange people disagree, “You shall receive my Recipe; “Nor feel a pang, nor give a Fee.” Death and the Antiquaries. THE Antiquaries, whose reliance Is, on those curious parts of Science, Which have been known but long forgot, And would in dark oblivion rot, Did not their ever anxious eyes Pierce into all obscurities, And thus unveil them once again For modern Learning to explain. These Sages are oft known to grope Upon a rugged Mountain's top, And dig among the caverns deep, Where wrecks of former ages sleep; While from the Castle's crumbling towers, Or Gothic Abby's ivied bowers, They cull, for the historic page, The truths of many a doubtful Age. Thus are their useful Labours shewn, New Lights on darkling times are thrown, And Knowledge added to our own. —But sometimes I have heard it said, They love to poke among the dead; And that these Antiquaries crave A Permit to invade the Grave. Once on a time, the story goes, (My verse repeats what's writ in prose), A curious wish their fancies tickled To know how Royal Folk were pickled; Or what was the preserving crust That check'd their mould'ring into dust, What Cearment kept them firm and pure By its enfolding Coverture. With these important ends in view, Near to the sacred Tomb they drew, Whose dark and narrow house contain'd The lifeless form of one who reign'd Within these realms, in days of yore, And its proud Crown with lustre wore. After the rest of many an age, Yielding to antiquarian rage, His Tomb's resisting walls give way, And offer to the light of day The corse which former ages wept, And look'd as if it only slept. While these grave men, the form survey'd, And with their learn'd conjectures play'd, Death, on th'enquiring groupe look'd down, With horrid grin and angry frown: But nor his shape nor griesly mien Was by the busy Sages seen, Nor could they hear the threat'ning word He thus, as to himself, preferr'd. “While you preserve the homage due, “You may the solemn object view: “Look while you list,—talk what you may, “But hands off, Gentlemen, I pray. “I'll strike that curious fellow dumb, “If he purloins a Royal thumb: “This fatal dart his breast shall sting, “If he slips off a royal ring. “No tricks shall exercise their power “Over this sacrilegious hour.” But false was all the Sprite's alarm For any meditated harm: No, not a ring or rag was stole, But all untouch'd, and safe and whole, The Royal figure was return'd To his dark house and re-inurn'd; There in Death's mansion to remain, Nor e'er to be disturb'd again, Till the great globe itself shall shake; Till the trump sounds and bids him wake. The Dainty Dish. WE know, because we daily see In this world's vast variety, That not a single foot of ground Can in its ample space be found, But in some form, or foul or fair, Death may possess a victim there. There's not a thing but may be made The Engine of his fatal Trade. The very means by which the Strength Of Nature's fram'd, may put, at length, By various unexpected ways, An early period to our days. Pleasure, within its gaudy bowers, May hide the Serpent train in flowers, And, in the Banquet's costly round, Delicious venom may be found. —The gilded Palace cannot screen The Owner of the splendid scene, With all its pomp and all its state, From the resistless stroke of Fate: While, 'tis the humble Peasant's lot To feel it in the straw-roof'd Cot. Nay, in the proud, illumin'd hall, Where the Feast ushers in the Ball: Where the rich Banquet gives delight, Aud Beauty crowns the splendid night, Death sometimes will his step advance, Proclaim the Toast, and join the Dance. —Whether by airy pleasure led, Or Sorrow's thorny paths we tread; Whate'er the point to which we stray, The Fun'rals meet us on our way. Yet, of mankind, a num'rous part Seem to be trying ev'ry art, To dissipate the awful gloom With which their fears becloud the tomb, And shun the means they all possess To turn it to their Happiness. For Virtue, as we ought to know, Can, to a Friend, convert the Foe. Can, of his power, each fear beguile, Force his grim frowns into a smile; And, whether 'tis our lot to feel The triumph of his fatal Steel, Or in Life's early, blooming years, Or when the hoary head appears, Blest Virtue can the stroke defy, And dying—claim the Victory. Much do I wish my humble song Were kindly call'd to dance along The fragrant path where Virtue showers The bloom of never-fading flowers. But I am call'd where Folly rules And marks its more distinguish'd Fools, Where sensual Banquets, till they cloy, Gives to the Glutton all his Joy. There is no form which Vice puts on, None so distinguish'd—no, not one So nauseous none, in Reason's eye As the swoll'n shape of Gluttony. —The gay, luxurious delights In which some pass their days and nights, Though to themselves the cause of ruin, Yet, in the road to their undoing, The Arts are call'd to gild the way, And Genius doth its powers display, While Labour whistles through the day. The Altar fair, whereon they waste Their squander'd wealth, is form'd with Taste; The Dome, 'neath which the Tripod stands, Is not the work of vulgar hands. The Painter decorates the scene, And sculptur'd marbles intervene. E'en when the Spendthrift, rich no more, For ever quits his Mansion door To seek, perhaps, a foreign shore, He still will leave of all that's spent Some gay, and costly Monument, Which it may be the Stranger's lot, T'enjoy with pride, when He's forgot. —E'en Avarice, that odious Elf, Which hoards its gold and starves itself, That living fills an useless space, Of erring nature the disgrace; Yet, by its savings, may prepare A Fund of Virtue for an Heir, If Fortune, in his breast, should find The gen'rous Love of human kind. Nay wine, though taken to excess, Will, in its way, the spirits bless, And make convivial joys abound Though Reason gains a transient wound. But these same cramming mortals meet With gloating eyes the various treat; In silence at their tables sit, Till they can't eat another bit; And when their well-cramm'd crops are full, They grow immeasureably dull. What is the good he e'er bestows From Morning's dawn to Evening's close, Who boasts it as his sole delight, To gorge his rav'nous appetite; And joys, when he at noon can say, “How lordly I shall dine to-day:” Then fills his gullet o'er and o'er, And sighs that he can eat no more. As the world's Victor, it is said, The tears of disappointment shed, That no more kingdoms rose to view For his proud prowess to subdue; These Corm'rants, when the stomach's still, Weep for another paunch to fill. Yes, such there are, and I knew one, But from this world he's lately gone, Who thought and said, that Life's best prize Was, when he pleas'd, to gormandize. Ask him, what news? He'd tell you true, What dinner he had then in view: Repeat the dishes, half a score, Which he had eat the day before; Nor hesitate to call it treason, Not to know what was then in season. —Of war he ne'er express'd a fear, But that of making Turbot dear: Though he would often wish for Peace, As certain Taxes then might cease; By which event he would be able To add some dainty to his table. —At length his Limbs, with hobbling gait, Could scarce support the body's weight; But, to the last, he could provide Sufficient power his steps to guide From his arm-chair and fire-side, When Jonathan appear'd to state That Dinner did his pleasure wait; When he would gobble Ven'son down, Long after all his teeth were gone. At the last Feast he e'er enjoy'd, And when his taste should have been cloy'd, “Where is my fav'rite dish,” he cried, “Let some one place it by my side.” Death heard his call and soon obey'd, And by his side the dish display'd; When he exclaim'd, “As I'm a sinner, “One slice—and I have clos'd my dinner.” The slice his eager knife supplies.— It will not pass—He choaks,—and dies. The Last Stage. THE course through which our Life is past, From our first moments to our last, Has been describ'd in various forms: The river's calm, the ocean's storms; The tranquil path, the beaten road, By the great bulk of mortals trod. Some in the wherry glide along, Or tug the oar 'gainst billows strong, Or turn with skill the swelling sail, As fair or adverse winds prevail: But though the emblem may be rude, It is as clearly understood If for our symbol we engage The common Carriage call'd a Stage. Few who their destin'd course begin, Or from the Sun or Angel Inn, Of the known way complete the whole Through which the wheels are bound to roll. When beaming Phœbus 'gins his race, Each Passenger asserts his place; And with no small impatience waits Till the Coach moves between the Gates. Some, e'er a few short hours are run, Will find their early Journey done: Others, before the Noon is come, May reach, in peace, their destin'd home. As from the Journey they retreat, New Comers fill each vacant seat;— But, from events of every day, Which shorten or obstruct the way, Few Trav'llers, in the Journey, ken Of mile-stones full threescore and ten. Such was the fate of Mrs. Cherry, At once, fat, cumbersome and merry. —Many a year was gone and past, Since she had been at London last, And all the wonders of the spot Which she then saw, were now forgot. But a dear Daughter young and fair Had married, and was settled there: Besides, a little Stranger came, To bless her with a Grannam's name. More than enough was this to call The Lady from a country Hall: This had the instant power to charm Her absence from the wealthy Farm, Where she had long been us'd to reign The Mistress of the Village train. Turkey and Fowl, and Ham and Chine, On which the Cits prefer to dine, With Partridge too, and eke a Hare, The luxuries of country Fare, She closely pack'd with bounteous care; And the next morn, at Turnpike Gate, The Coach received her comely weight. But the tear stood in either eye, When her dear Yeoman said, “Good bye.” For twenty years were gone, for aye, Since she had left him for a day. She felt the joy that would attend And wait upon her journey's end; But now they were about to part, The Mother shar'd but half her heart; And fond Affection's tender strife Betray'd the feelings of the Wife. The Sun had scarce sunk to the West, E'er she became her Daughter's guest: She kiss'd the Baby o'er and o'er As babes have oft been kiss'd before; And, when it smil'd, was charm'd to see Each feature of the Family. —About the Town she whilom rang'd, And ev'ry day the sight was chang'd: Each various shew she went to view, With Bonaparte's Carriage too: The Panorama's magic space, And Lord Mayor's Sword and gilded Mace. She saw once more St. Dunstan's men Strike, with fierce stroke, the hour of Ten; Nor did she think her time ill-spent, In viewing many a Monument, Which tells the Hero's patriot story, And forms the Abbey's gloomy glory. From St. Paul's domineering dome, She bade her wond'ring eyes to roam, And London view'd in all its pride, With a surrounding world beside. She felt th'unrivall'd powers of Kean, And Miss O'Neil was heard and seen; But still with all these new delights, Her pleasant days and social nights, She gladden'd when the time was come That call'd her to her much-lov'd home. But she was doom'd no more to see Nor Home nor Husband;—the Decree Of Fate had bade her eyes to close, E'er the next morning's dawn arose. She kiss'd, with fond, renew'd embrace, The Offspring of her honest race; Then sought the Coach—to take her place. When Death was there, with horrid grin, To shove the cumbrous Matron in. But she, unconscious of her Fate, Join'd in the Vehicle's debate, And did her mild discourse supply With inoffensive pleasantry, Till the three passengers were gone, And she, at length, was left alone. —The Sun had beam'd with cheering ray, And brighten'd Nature through the day, But at the Evening's latest hour, The clouds, as they began to lour, Did the departing scene deform, And all foretold the coming storm. Soon it came on, with beating rain; The fierce winds blew an hurricane; The thunder roll'd,—dark was the night,— The Horses, seiz'd with sudden fright, No more obey the firm command Of the stern Coachman's steady hand; Then madly quit the beaten road, And plunge into the river's flood. Where the impetuous, waters rage Was Mrs. Cherry's last, sad stage. She scream'd at first, then prayer preferr'd, But neither scream, nor pray'r was heard. Thus this devoted Matron died, Where she had only meant to ride. Time, Death, and Eternity. A NIGHT THOUGHT. HAIL, awful darkness! that with pitchy Robe Borrowed of Chaos, dost, awhile, enfold The habitable world, and sea and sky; Thee I now woo, at solemn midnight Hour That listens to the voice of my complaint. Oft it is heard, when on the restless couch Of tossing pain, Care lies and weeps till morn, And sheds its tears, sad, tort'ring tears, The Essence of the Heart's disastrous woe. I shed them now,—but long I am not doom'd To feel their cank'ring drops adown my cheek; Death soon will make it pale, and lay me safe From every mortal pain within the grave. —Come happy hour,—haste on thy swift career, And with Fate's barbed shaft give wish'd for peace. What peace on that fell dart? Yes, lasting peace:— Peace that will never interruption know; Peace, such as Angels taste, and Heaven bestows. —Farewell then, thou vain world no more I bend To thy capricious power! nor all the gilded baits That wealth can boast or Lordly greatness give, Nor even graceful Beauty's smiling charm Could tempt me to the treach'rous shore again. I go where rich and poor together sleep, And the Slave's dust doth mingle with his Lord: Where the rod drops from Power's unnerved hand And Beauty feeds the hunger of the worm. —You smile, but there the good man's sorrows end, And all his Joys begin. The grave's the path, The shadowy path which leads to endless day, Where suns with purest ray, eternal shine, To their meridian fix'd, and set no more. Haste then and weave my shroud, and bring the bier And bear me to be mingled with the dust. Let not the plumes nod o'er my sable hearse, Nor Sculpture labour with the flatt'ring strain: Let not the blazing torch make midnight noon, To light me to my long and dark abode; But may the Summer Sun at Evening Hour Cast its faint rays upon the awful scene, Where Earth is given to Earth, and Dust to Dust. Smile then, ye gay ones, as I pour the strain, Or o'er my plantive musings breath a sigh Of friendly pity!—Grateful I return The pitying sigh, breath'd from a pensive heart, A heart, which though it hovers o'er the tomb, Boasts brighter Joys, than the gay, glitt'ring Scenes Where your delights are center'd, can bestow. —I soon shall be at rest:—can ye say that, Ye Youthful train, who travel through the maze, The giddy maze of Passion's checquer'd dance? Can ye say that, with Fevers in your heart, That strive each hour to quench the burning flame, At Pleasure's warm, intoxicating Spring. Heaven is the seat of Mercy, there enthron'd The Cherub sits, in mild but awful state: From thence he views the hearts of mortal men With pitying eye, and wishes to delay The stern and steady course of rig'rous Law And stops the Scourgman's hand, to pour a balm Into the wounds which vengeful Justice gives To erring mortals: then invites them back From Errors's fatal path, to Virtue's way, And beams eternal sunshine o'er their heads. Say, what is pleasure Ye mistaken fair! Is it to yield your beauties to the wish Of him who buys with gold the venal Joy? Is it to give the mercenary smile To him you do not love, in sad Exchange For the gay lustre which adorns your hair, And all your gawdy show and vain attire, The Liv'ry of your more than servile state. Tell me, and tell me true;—when ye have stray'd At Evening Hour along the Village path, Though deck'd in flaunting Fashion's glitt'ring robe Have you not envied Virtue's homely dress, And wish'd to change your mansion for the Cot Where she, well pleas'd, beneath her humble Thatch, Sits smiling o'er the Labours of the Wheel. Mine is a pensive mind: to me more dear The Ev'ning's purple hue, and rising mist, Circling, in mantle grey, the verdant hill And Sylvan upland, than the mid-day pomp, Of Nature, gilded by the gorgeous Sun. The triumphs of the great, the splendid show Of proud Magnificence demand in vain My reverence: more soothing far to me The Turf that heaves upon the peasant's grave, And the once fragrant flowers that wither there. Nor all the sounds of Music strike my soul With such affecting power, as doth the Knell Which calls the dead to their expecting home. —I walk around the Tomb, and pensive view The quiet cavern, in whose dark abode, When evil tongues hiss forth the foul abuse, When Fortune turns away, and Friends prove false, Man may a safe, and peaceful refuge find, A certain refuge and a sure retreat. —Where is the Covert from Life's frequent storm?— Ye who have long been toss'd upon the tide, The flowing tide, of Time, O tell me where. Is it amid the vales where pleasure sports, With all her airy tribes; or on the giddy height Where proud Ambition takes its tott'ring seat; Or is it in the dreary, darksome cave, Where starving Av'rice trembles o'er its gold? Is it in bowers form'd of roses sweet, And hung with every garland of the Spring Wove by the Fingers of assiduous Love? Or where, in Learning's cell the studious lamp Throws its pale, quiv'ring light upon the page, By long and midnight toil severely fram'd. —Nor in the flowery vales where pleasure sports, Nor where Ambition rears the tottering seat;— 'Tis not within the Miser's gloomy cave; 'Tis not within the roseate Bowers of Love, Nor where the pale Lamp lights the studious sage, To midnight toil: alas, it is not there. And while we seek in vain amid the great Or on the gorgeous thrones where monarchs sit, It often may be found in humble cot Where Virtue with the honest peasant dwells. —And what is Virtue? 'Tis the conscious power Of acting right in spite of every foe, That may oppose its base malicious aim To check the pure designs which it inspires. —It is to stem the tide Corruption rolls O'er half the world, to curb the impetuous will Of lawless passion, and, on Life's vast stage, To act that noble part which will attain The good man's praise and the applause of Heaven. —Yes, Virtue, potent Virtue, can secure 'Gainst every peril; 'tis a triple shield To him who has it, 'gainst the pointed darts Of ev'ry enemy; the hour of death With all its gloom, gives not a fear to him, Who triumphs o'er the grave; he stands secure Amid the ruins of a fallen world. —Virtue will listen to the trumpet's sound, With holy awe, yet hear it unappall'd, And feels Eternity its destin'd sphere:— When all the works of Man shake to their base, And the world melts away whereon they stood; When Time's last agonising hour is come, And Death, who, from Creation's pregnant hour, Has made the world a grave, himself shall die, When Man from his long slumber shall awake, And the Day breaks that never more shall close; Then Virtue shall its promis'd glory claim, And find it, too, at the o'erflowing Source Of Heaven's stupendous and eternal Joys.
