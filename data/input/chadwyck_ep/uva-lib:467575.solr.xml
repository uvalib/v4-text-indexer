      <field name="fulltext">The first Quinquagene. Quoniam omnis terre Deus: Psallite sapienter. Psal. 47. Ad Lectorem. Hec quicun? legis, tu flexu &amp; acumine vocis In numeros numeros doctis accentibus effer, Affectus? impone legens, distinctio sensum Auget, &amp; ignauis dant interualla vigorem. To the Reader. Of thee good frend: thus muche I craue, These few requestes I say: No browes to bende: but first withsaue, To iudge by like assay. And if ye spie: as much ye may, where strayd amisse I haue: To mend where I: went out of way, with art more sad and graue. But reade it round: and hacke it not, as iumblyng short with long: Expresse them sound: and racke them not, as learners vse among. Accent in place: your voyce as needth, note number, poynte, and time: Both lyfe and grace: good reading breedth, flat verse it reysth sublime. Obserue the trayne: the ceasure marke, To rest with note in close: Rythmedogrell playne: as dogs do barke, ye make it els to lose. Reade oft inough: well spell the lyne, less iarr to heare by vse: If verse be rough: no fault is myne, if ye the eare abuse. But princepall thing: your lute to tune, that hart may sing in corde: Your voyce and string: so fine to prune, to loue and serue the Lorde. Syng Psalmes and hymnes: and songes on hye, To God your selues among: But sing in hart: make melodye, To God geue thankes in song. Paule. Ephe. 5. Col. 3. Jf sad ye be: and beare the crosse, In faith pray ye contrite: If glad ye be: and feele no losse, Sing Psalmes of thankes aright. Iames. V. In Lute and Harpe: reioyce to sing, Syng Psalmes in decachorde: Of all the earth: sith God is Kyng, Syng wisely feare the Lorde. Dauid. Psalme. 33. 47. 68. The fathers olde: both sought and found, Sweete musikes moodes full fine: The Scripture songes: they did expound, Their hartes were all deuine. Iesus Syrach. 44. VVho knowledge loueth: teach him thy lore, No musike hinder thou: Where hearyng wanth: spare wordes the more, And modestie allow. Iesus Syrach. 32. Of the vertue of Psalmes. What man hath hart: in heauines With sundry cares opprest: And would haue helpe: in redines, To heale his thoughtfull brest. And yet by man: in sueertie, for Phisike want his cure: Thus set in hard: perplexitie, To God yet trusting sure. Let him beholde: the melodie, of Dauids blissefull harpe: In Psalmes there fynde: his remedie, He may of care so sharpe. If forreyne foe; or ennemy, Hath wasted all thy coastes: No helpe thou canst: haue suerly, more strong to dawnt his boastes. If theeues thy goodes: haue caught in net, And haue made thee ful bare: In Psalmes thy mynde: if thou do set, they will thy losse repayre. If wrung thou beest: by tyrannie, And banishte out of land: Thou mayst releaue: thy miserie, Content by Psalmes to stand. If trayne be layd: all craftely, In spite to trap thy way: Take Dauids lore: than redily, And bid thy foes go play. Thou mournst and sighest: in doulefull hart, by death thy children gone: If Psalmes thou takest: in ghostly part, They will asswage thy mone. In house and land: if poore thou lye, downe cast on both thy knees: Here maist thou haue: recouerie, for all that thou canst leese. If panges and paynes: both sharpe and fell, with gripes thy body wrynges: Sweete Dauids harpe: can ease thee well, for it good Phisike singes. If borne thou be: enuiouslie, In skorne and great disdayne: No patrone thou: canst better spie, then Dauids life and raigne. Thy hie degree: is low deiect, by fortunes turnyng blast: If Dauids state: thou seest reiect, thou shalt be lesse agast. Thy fieldes lye all: in baren sort, by burnyng Sunne his heate: To Dauids welles: if thou resort, His dewes thy soyle shal weete. Agayne if they: be ouerflowne, By rage of water streames: If Dauids Psalmes: thou makest thine owne, Thy soyle must feele his beames. (O foolishe men: that marke the skie, The Starres and Planets gate: By them to searche: their destenie, and so repose their state.) And thus what wo: or miserie, may moue or freat thy hart: In Psalmes thou mayst: haue remedie, to beare all payne and smart. Not beare them well: I onely saie, but them expell ful strong: Who like in hart: can them defraie, as Dauid did among. Not thus alone: hast thou thine ease, of worldly griefe and payne: But here thou mayst: all soules disease, by comfort sweete restrayne. So deepe in sinne: no wight can bee, no conscience so thrall: But prest reliefe: here may he see, to reyse his deadly fall. No wight can be: so burdenous, mans senses harde to presse: But Psalmes that be: so vertuous, can soone the weight redresse. Now go and searche: the Discipline, of mortall men so vayne: Who taught by wit: or sort deuine, of them these helpes to gayne. So foule shalt thou: deceiued bee, to trust their rules and lawes: As dreamers be: which thinke to see, all wealth within their clawes. Go now to men: and beg their art, in sicknes thee to saue: By meanes vntrue: to heale thy smart, where God thy hart should haue. This Prophet here: forbiddeth thee, thus once from God to stray: Euen he that harpth: all melodie, of godly wisdomes way. For what thou readst: Saint Austen holdth, in law or stories true: In Prouerbs wise: or prophets olde, the Psalme doth it renue. Both what is past: and what to come, the psalme doth it perfourme: It is a law: in perfect some to maners them to fourme. Though Scripture booke: sayth Athanase, of vertue rule it bee: Yet Psalter booke: of soule it hase, Status ani marum in Psalmis. the state for eche degree. In other bookes: where man doth looke, but others wordes seeth he: As proper hath: this onely booke, most wordes his owne to be. It is a glasse: a myrrour bright, for soule to see his state: A garden fayre: all fully dight, with herbes most delicate. A treasure house: ye may repute, this booke of all good lore: All wholsome salue: to distribute, to eche mans griefe and sore. For who delyghth: them well to sing: his mynde shall feele a grace: Of sinne both dulde: the cursed sting: and vertue come in place. The Psalmes sayth he: in verse be folde: and tuned by musike sweete: The eare to please: of yong and olde, so Dauid thought it meete. Iosephus sayth: and Philo wrighth, Lib. 7. Iuda. anti. c. 12. Euseb. lib. 2. cap. 16, 17. That Dauid Metres made: Quinquemetres: some trimetres, by musikes tract and trade. For that that is: commended both, with tune and tyme aright: It sinkth more sweete: and deeper goth, in harte of mans delight. O wondrous fact: of God I saie, in his deuise so playne: Though we be seene: but sing and plaie, the soule yet winth his gayne. The Psalter booke: of Psalterie, an instrument so namde: For that the Psalmes: most commonly, to it were tuned and framde. And who that noth: and hath it waighde, how Psalmes by Metre go: Can blame no art: by rythme so layde, nor musike squard therto. Thus Bernard sweete: in holy rede, Christes death reuolued in rythme: So Ambrose sage: and worthy Bede, thought this no shame or cryme. And what is verse: but rythme to name, in Lattine, Frenche, or Greeke: Our Englishe verse: I count the same, though all men hit not leke. The Psalmist stayde: with tuned songe, the rage of myndes agast: As Dauid did: with harpe among, to Saule in furye cast. With golden stringes: such harmonie, his harpe so sweete did wrest: That he relieud: his phrenesie, whom wicked sprites possest. Both Powle and Iames: in their deuise, bid Psalmes with voyce to vse: In hymnes and songes: sweete exercise, To God in hart to muse. Who tunes and rythms: as aske their kyndes, to Psalmes can frame I saie: The sweete in strength: for that he fyndes, must beare the bell awaie. The singyng man: and Poete must, with graue deuine concurre: As Dauids skill: all three discust, when he his harpe did sturre. Depart ye songes: lasciuious, from lute, from harpe depart: Geue place to Psalmes: most vertuous, and solace there your harte. Ye songes so nice: ye sonnets alls, of lothly louers layes: Ye worke mens myndes: but bitter gall, by phansies peuishe playes. My readers all: now must I pray, in worth to take my payne: I ment but well: as well they may, meane well, and winne some gayne. As some beforne: the lyke hath playde, of Psalmes to pike their choyce: And them in ryme: so fyne haue layde, to sing with musikes voyce. Then some in prose; most learnedly, haue tournd the phrase and worde: Some glose haue made: full diuersly, yet sang in good accorde. That some in verse: right latenly, haue strunged Dauids harpe: They haue their laudes: most worthely, their paynes ought no man carpe. Herein because: all mens delight, bene diuerse founde in mynde: I tournd the Psalmes: all whole in sight, in rythmes of diuers kynde. And where at first: I secret ment, but them my selfe to sing: Yet frendes requestes: made me relent, thus them abrode to bring. Expresse his pen: in exercise, who list, he may, that can: By this is wrought: no preiudice, I trust to God or man. Uerse cleare to frame: was first pretence, I followed Hierome next: Third Chaldey glose: fourth seuentie sence, rythme, tyme, were fift and sext. So Uatablus: and Pellicane, in truth were not reiecte: Nor Munster yet: or Pagnyne playne, in tonges were fled for secte. From Ludolfe that: Carthusian, the collect most deryueth: No prayse pardy: to any man, to hide, by whom he thriueth. Who more will searche: how here it goes, let him the Hebrew trye: Where wordes were skant: with texts or glose that want I did supplye: And that in some: reportes be found, and wordes as spare put to: They may be lest: the sence yet sound, though Metre varyth so. If some be blamde: to rythme to thicke, transpose the wordes ye may: The lesse by right: may Momus kicke, the beame so soone away. If some will carpe: so light a warke, graue Psalmes in rythmes displayde: 2. Reg. 6. Let Michol heare: before the arke, how Dauid daunced and playde. Where sences straunge: oft diuersly, be seene in writers skill: I did yet pen: my fantasie, let others do their will. Presuming not: yet thus in sight, as I could this do best: My Lute was set: in whole delight, these tunes deuine to wrest. And yet good frende: beare thou with mee, though wordes be straynd among: The verse and phrase: forst breuitie, I sude yet sence most strong. Require not heere: great difference, In wordes so ofte the same: Although to feele: great violence, I might not chaunge the name. Conceyue in hart: no griefe to sore, wordes olde so ofte to vewe: Thy gayne therby: is wrought the more, though wordes be neuer newe. How can we feele: sacietie, in fourmes of godly speache: The soule which feelth: aduersitie, loues playnes health to seache. Among gay wordes: that hart were seene, therto she bendeth first: She doth not gase: on bushe so greene, or suckth the post for thirst. Right path of truth: most earnestly, God graunt we holde in worde: To lyue to God vnfeinedly, In hart with one accorde. Us song should moue: as sprite therby, might tunes in concorde sing: God graunt these Psalmes: might edifie, that is the chiefest thing. So els if tune: should reason rule, and senses brute haue will: To fleshly lust: might voyce recule, and soule bide barren still. No pastime vayne: to sing in voyce, or thus to set in rythme: Repyne not frende: at this my choyce, vouchsaue my restfull tyme. Uerse harde in mouth: while oft I chowde, I spied therin no wast: Cleare sent to mynde: more sweetely flowde, earst thus not felt in tast. Nor yet of this: I do repent, sith thus my hart I easde: Iudge Reader well: my good entent, so thinke that God be pleasde. All shrewd to iudge: thy neighbours cause, may thee the lyke befall: Euen feare thou God: and kepe his lawes, now this is ende of all. Henrie Haward Earle of Surrie in his Ecclesiastes. All such as enterprise, To put newe thinges in vre: Of them that scorne shall their deuise, May well themselues assure. The first Psalme. The Argument. This Psalme in sence Beatus vir.

Psalme. II. The Argument. Of Christ ye see A Prophecie Thus Dauid spake with vs: As merueiling That earthly king Should rage against him thus Quare fremuerunt. 1 Why fumeth in sight: the Gentils spite, In fury raging stout? Why taketh in hond: the people fond, Uayne thinges to bring about? 2 The kinges arise: the lordes deuise, in counsayles mett therto: Agaynst the Lord: with false accord, against his Christ they go. 3 Let vs they say: breake downe their ray, of all their bondes and cordes: We will renounce: that they pronounce, their loores as stately lordes. 4 But God of might: in heauen so bright, Shall laugh them all to scorne: The Lord on hie: shall them defie, they shall be once forlorne. 5 Then shall his ire: speake all in fire, to them agayne therfore: He shall with threate: their malice beate, in his displeasure sore. 6 Yet am I set: a king so great, on Sion hill full fast: Though me they kill: yet will that hill, my lawe and worde outcast. 7 Gods wordes decreed: I (Christ) wil sprede for God thus sayd to mee: My sonne I say: thou art, this day, I haue begotten thee. 8 Aske thou of mee: I will geue thee, to rule all Gentils londes: Thou shalt possesse: in suernesse, the world how wide it stondes. 9 With iron rod: as mighty God, all rebels shalt thou bruse: And breake them all: in pieces small, as sherdes the potters vse. 10 Be wise therfore: ye kinges the more, Receyue ye wisdomes lore: Ye iudges strong: of right and wrong, aduise you now before. 11 The Lorde in feare: your seruice beare, with dread to him reioyce: Let rages be: resist not ye, him serue with ioyfull voyce. 12 The sonne kisse ye: lest wroth he be, lose not the way of rest: For when his ire: is set on fire, who trust in hym be blest. Psalme. III. The Argument. This Psalme endight How troubled sprite may comfort haue of God. As woe be gone From Absalon meke Dauid fled so brode. Domine quid. 1 O Lord how ill: encrease they still, that trouble me so sore? Full many rise: in spitefull wise, agaynst me more and more. 2 Right many one: whan I do mone, alasse my soule they fret: They say I haue: no God to saue, Sela oh this temptation great. 3 But yet O Lord: thou wilt accord, as shielde to fence my soule: My worship cleare: thou art full deare, my hed thou wilt extoll. 4 I did but mone: with voyce alone, to God my Lorde in will: He heard me iust: as I dyd trust, from his so holy hill. Sela 5 I layde me downe: I slept full sound, and vp I rose agayne: For God me kept: where safe I slept, his grace dyd me sustayne. 6 To be afrayde: or yet dismayde, for thousandes ten, what neede? They go about: to driue me out, but God will dull theyr speede. 7 Up Lord saue mee: my God most free, on cheeke thou smitest my foes: Well hast thou chrust: theyr teeth to dust, of such as wicked goes. 8 Unto the Lord: by truthes recorde, belongth all sauing helth: Thy blessing hand: so nie doth stand, to worke thy peoples welth. Psalme. IIII. The Argument. The church in stress For heauinesse complaynth to God full sore. The good haue ease Of their disease they sacrifice therfore. Cum inuocarem. 1 O God so hie: heare when I crie, my right is all in thee: Thou takest me fro: al troublous wo haue mercy heare thou mee. 2 Ye sonnes of men: how long agayne, will ye blaspheme my name? Why triumphe ye: in vanitie? why seeke ye lies to frame? Sela 3 Know this ye foes: that God hath chose, himselfe all godly men: And when I call: this Lord of all, he straight will heare me then. 4 Of wrathfull ire: refraine the fire, sinne not but muse in hart: Upon your beds: keepe still your heds, deathes day recount in part. 5 Looke ye arise: in sacrifice, of righteousnes in skill: And put your trust: in God so iust, but tame your fleshly will. 6 There many bee: that say, O see, who good to vs can do? Lift vp thy face: of cherefull grace, on vs O Lord to go. 7 Thou chearst my hart: as God thou art, with ioye of thy good sprite: Since corne and wine: with oyle so fine, of theirs increast in sight. 8 I will me lay: in peace I say, my sleepe to take full well: I hope for thou: O Lord as now, makst me most safe to dwell. Psalme. V. The Argument. The church in sprite, Maketh sute aright, for all opprest in payne Here Christ aduanceth His heritaunce the Iewes he blamth agayne. Verba mea 1 Expend O Lord: my plaint of worde, in griefe that I do make: My musing mind: recount most kind geue eare for thine owne sake. 2 O harke my grone: my crying mone, my king, my God thou art: Let me not stray: from thee away, to thee I pray in hart. 3 My voyce and vowe: thou wilt alowe, betymes O Lord so free: In spring of day: I thee will pray, and shall looks vp to thee. 4 This I may vow: the God art thou, which hatest all wickednes: No malice fell, with thee can dwell, thou louest no cruelnes. Such foolish spite: can bide no sight, of thy good louely face: Thou doost defie: their vanitie, who wickednes embrace. Thou shalt destroy: and them annoy, with lies who shame thy worde: Bloudthirsty men: which crafty renne, the Lord hath them abhorde. 5 Iust will I go: thy house into, in trust of thy great grace: In feare I will: do honour still, against that holy place. 6 O Lord be guide: defend my side, in thy great righteousnesse: Make playne the way: lesse I do stray, my foes shall brag the lesse. 7 Their mouthes expresse: no faithfulnesse, theyr holow hartes be vayne: Wide throte they haue: as open graue, theyr tonge but lyes do fayne. 8 Destroy their thought: O God for nought, theyr owne wayes be theyr shame: Expell them out: in lies so stout, who thus blaspheme thy name. 9 Let them reioyce: that trust thy voyce, aye thankes they shall extend: Who loue thy name: shall ioye the same, thou doost so them defend. 10 Thou Lord wilt than: geue rightwise man, the heauenly blisse from thence: Thy fauour kynde: is not behynde, as them with shield to fence. Psalme. VI. The Argument. An earnest crie To God on hie of men all wrapt in wo At last they winne, Gods helpe for sinne and glad reioyce they so Dominene in furore. 1 O carpe not sower: thou Lord of power, my sinne in ire to sore: Nor chasten mee: in crueltie, I pray to thee therfore. 2 But mercy haue: my life to saue, O Lord for weake am I: My bones be vext: with feare annext, thy domes make me to crye. 3 My soule also: is full of woo, my conscyence doth quake: O Lord how long: thy scourge so strong, shall me thus fearefull make. 4 O Lord returne: thou seest I mourne, make free my soule to go: Oh saue me now: thy grace auowe, thy glory standth therto. 5 In death no man: remember can thy name to celebrate: What man thus bound: thy prayse can sound in pit and hell to late. 6 Of groning so: I weary go, my bed I nyghtly washe: My couch with teares: for sinfull feare, I water thus alas. 7 My beuty wanneth: my trouble standth, myne eyes for thought be dymme: My zeale for wrath: much magre hath, amyds my foes so brymme. 8 Auaunt ye all: to you I call, which worke all vanitie: The Lord of hostes: hath heard your bostes, and eke my weping crye. 9 This Lord I say: at needefull day, hath heard my meke request: From hence he will: with mercy still, heare me to geue me rest. 10 Myne enemies: all hatefull spies, shall feele both shame and payne: Gods helping grace: them all shall chace, to flee swift backe agayne. Psalme. VII. The Argument. As Semei Full wickedly at Dauid shewed his spite So who with lye Is charged hie may pray this Psalme aright. Domine deus meus in te. 1 O Lord in thee: my trust I see, for why my God thou art: From men vntrue: which me pursue saue me and take my part. 2 Lest he deuour: my soule so stoure, as Lyon doth the sheepe: Lest pieces small: he make of all, if none be me to keepe. 3 O God my Lord: let truth record, if this in me do stand: Let it be sought: if guile I wrought, if euill done hath my hand. 4 If I good will: haue taken euill, to frende that frendly delt: Yea quit did I: my enemy, when causeles hate I felt. 5 Then let my foes: worke all their woes, and take my soule in spite: Let them confound: my life to ground, Sela my name in dust to wright. 6 O rise in ire: Lord I desire, my wrathfull foes represse: Stirre vp to me: thy set decree, which once thou didst expresse. 7 So folke in streete: on heapes will meete, in church to prayse thy might: For all their sake: my partie take, rayse vp thy selfe on hight. 8 The Lord iudgeth all: as truth befall: O sentence geue my side: To my desert: stand Lord in hart, as iust my workes be tried. 9 Let euill I pray: consume alway, of wicked men the traynes: Oh guide the iust: true God of trust, thou triest both hartes and raynes. 10 No helpe of man: obteyne I can, my God is all myne ayde: He them preserueth: that well deserueth, whose hartes to right be layde. 11 God iudge he is: full right iwis, both strong and patient: Who dare prouoke: his heauy stroke, to ire when he is bent. 12 Except ye tourne: your life in fourme, his sword he myndth to whet: His bowe to bend: he doth entend, it is so ready set. 13 Deathes dartes most hard: he hath preparde, against their pride and wrong: His arrowes bright: be prest to smight, these persecutors strong. 14 Behold and see: how traueleth hee, to do all wickedly: Conceyued hath hee: anxietie, but beare he shall a lye. 15 To delue and digge: a pit so bigge, his hart was wholy bent: But he in pit: shall fall in it, that he so crafty ment. 16 For iust in speede: his wrathfull deede, with hym shall meete at gate: His wickednes: in spitefulnes, shall fall vpon hys pate. 17 In hart all whole: I will extoll, this Lord as he deserue: I will record: this heauenly Lord, his name I meane to serue. Psalme. VIII. The Argument. Here thankes ensue To God most due for his great giftes to men How Christ deiect Of cruell sect and how he raignth agayne Domine Dominus noster. 1 O Lord our guide: thy name how wide in all the world excels? Thy glory great: thou hie hast set, aboue the heauenly cels. 2 Babes mouthes so yong: euen sucklings tong thy laude thou madest them tell: Thy foes to blanke: their threates to danke, to still thaduenger fell. 3 Thy heauens whan I: consider hie, thy mighty worke of hand: The Moone by night: of Starres the light, in order how they stand. 4 What thing is man: Lord thinke I than, that thou so him regardst? What is mans childe? so pore so milde? that thou so hym rewardst? 5 Thou didst abate: his porte and state, more lowe then aungels bee: Thou didst him crowne: in great renowne, aduanst in dignitie. 6 Thou madest him sitte: as Lord most fitte, of all thy workes of hand: And vnder cast: all thing thou hast, as his footestoole to stand. 5 Both sheepe and cowe: the oxe to plowe, thou madest for man his loue: The beast in fielde: both tame and wylde, that man might all improue. 6 All foules in skie: how hye they flie, yet stoupe for man his neede: All fishe in sea: how deepe they be, they ryse mans sonne to feede. 7 O Lord of power: our gouernour, how much excelth thy name? This world so wide: therin what bydeth, doth sprede thy worthy fame? Psalme. IX. The Argument. Thankes here be spyed To God applyed for tyrauntes iust decaie: Who persecute In hatefull sute good Christians all daie. confitebor 1 Due thankes with song: I wil ful long in hart geue Lord to thee: I will endight: of thy great might, thy workes so wondrous bee. 2 I will reioyce: in hart and voyce, full glad in thee O Lorde: Thy name so hie: to magnifie, in song I will accorde. 3 For that in hast: my foes fled fast, and backe fell all their might: No better speede: shall them succeede, but fall from thy good sight. 4 But thou in deede: hast maynteined, my right and eke my cause: Thy throne is true: thy sentence due, thou iudgest with equall lawes. 5 The heathen sect: well hast thou checkt, thou hast stroyd wicked men: Thou hast theyr name: put out with shame, for aye and euer agayne. 6 O thou so hye: myne enemye, thy wastes haue now their ende: As citie bee: destroyed by thee, theyr fame wyth them is shend. 7 But Gods deuise: shall stand and rise, the Lord shall still endure: In iust regard: he hath prepard, his seat to iudge vs sure. 8 For righteousnes: he will expresse, when he shall iudge the land: And iudge shall hee: in equitie, his folke by rightfull hand. 9 The Lord I say: will be all day, a fence for man opprest: A refuge sweete: in season meete, when griefe at hand is prest. 10 Who knowth thy name: will trust the same, for they thy worde do leeke: For their aduayle: thou wilt not fayle, all them that thee do seeke. 11 O prayse the Lord: in psalmes accorde, who dwelth in Zion place: Declare his strength: with wordes at length to folke of his good grace. 12 For whan in ire: he doth enquire, for bloud he them recounth: He will not yet: the poore forget, theyr cryes to hym do mount. 13 O Lord me saue: and mercy haue, expende my wofull state: How suffer I: myne enemy, ryd me from death the gate. 14 That I may tell: thy daughters well, of Zyon all thy prayse: To sprede in streete: thy health so sweete, to ioye thy health alwayes. 15 The Heathen bee: sonke downe ye see, in pit that they dyd delue: Their owne set net: theyr foote hath get, and trapt therwith themselue. 16 The Lord is seene: how he hath beene, true iudge to wicked bandes: The wycked is: well snarde iwis, wyth workes of hys owne handes. 17 The naught shall dwell: euen thrust to hell, if they wyll not repent: Yea all the rout: that put God out, of mynde shall foule be shent. 18 For God so wyse: wyll not despyse, alway the poore that wayle: The restfull harte: of mysers smarte, for euer shall not quayle. 19 Up Lord to stand: lest vpper hand, man get of thy good flocke: The Heathens spite: iudge thou in sight, wyth all theyr broode and stocke. 20 Put them in feare: thy dread to beare, O Lord themselfe to see: As wretched men: how wyde they renne, in errour all from thee. Sela Psalme. X. The Argument. This Psalme dependth Of thothers ende it prayth against the proude Who vse theyr might To boste in spight theyr ende not so allowed. Vt quid Domine. Why stondst so far: and art no nar? O Lord why hydest thy face? When trouble ryse: wilt thou deuise in neede to shew no grace? Whyles men of pryde: so wycked byde, the poore in fire is brent: Let them in wiles: and all theyr guiles, be trapt wyth lyke entent. Thungodlies actes: his bostes and crackes, be praysed at his desire: With prayse all rouse: the couetous, whom God abhorrth in ire. The wycked wyght: so vaunteth in sight, of God to force right nought: He taketh no care: in welthy fare, no God in all his thought. Hys croked wayes: all greuous layes, thy iudgements scape his eyes: He feareth no man: say what he can, all foes he doth dispise. In his proud brayde: his hart thus sayd, tushe, who shall cast me downe? No harme or woo: can chance me to, my power kepeth my renowne. His mouth euen flowes: with cursing throws he ioynth deceyt and fraude: Ungodlynes: in folyshnes, his tong hath vnder yawde. He lurkth in streete: as theefe is meete, so close wyth all the riche: The iust to kill: in peuishe will, the poore he marketh mich. In denne he dwelth: as lyon fell, and lurketh the poore to snatche: The poore by might: to rauishe quyte, whom he in net doth catche. He falth at eye: most fawningly, yet guiles be all his fruites: That this poore sort: myght so resort, in handes of hys deputes. His hart sayth tush: he thinkth euen thus, that God forgotten hath: His face away: he turnth (he sayth) he seeth no poore mans scath. Yet God and Lord: for thy true worde, arise, lyft vp thy hande: The poore defend: thy might extend, forget not hym in bande. Why thus so loude: should men so proude, prouoke almighty God? Tush thou (they say:) wilt search no day, their hartes talke thus so brode. Thou seest at eye: and markst full nye, to quyte all wrong and stresse: The poore doth stand: to thy good hand, thou aydst all comfortlesse. Breake downe the power: the malice sower, of wycked man so blynde: If thou in tyme: wouldst searche hys cryme, no where thou shouldst hym fynde. Our lyuing Lord: by truthes record, is kyng for aye no doubt: The heathen spyte: shall perishe quyte, from land of hys full out. Thou Lord hast hard: in good regard, the sutes of all the poore: Theyr hartes in care: thou didst prepare, thou hardst both day and hower. To iudge the stresse: of fatherlesse, to helpe the poore to right: That earthly man: agaynst them than, no more might rise in sight. Psalme. XI. The Argument. Here hast thou proofe How it behoueth strong fayth in stormes to stand: Agaynst the trayne Of errours vayne of all the diuelishe band. In domino confido. 1 In Lord so great: my hope is set, why than my soule bid ye? That she should hast: as bird agast, to hils that desert be? 2 The wycked loe: haue bent theyr bowe, theyr shaftes in quiuer thrust: To shoote from hye: all priuelye, at men of hart so iust. 3 If earth the ground: tournd vpside downe, though heauen and earth should fall: The iust in woe: what should he do? but sticke to God in all. 4 The Lord is yet: in temple set, in heauen the Lord hath place: The poore he spyeth: as thence he trieth, mens childerns walkes and pase. 5 The Lord alowth: and iust auowth, the rightwise man full well: His soule defieth: whose hart applieth, in wickednes to dwell. 6 Downe he shall rayne: to theyr great payne, vpon th'ungodlies hart: Snare, brymstone, fyre: wyth tempestes ire, these stormes, theyr cup in part. 7 For as the Lorde: is iust in worde, so loueth he sothfastnes: Hys ryghtfull eye: will pleasauntly, behold all righteousnes. Psalme. XII. The Argument. This Psalme declarth The poore mans care for truth so falne to ground When pride bearth sayle No truth preuayle But God will it confound. Saluum me fac. 1 Helpe Lord so hye: this case, for why not one good man is more: The faythfull gone: scant any one, theyr children mynished sore. 2 They talke so free: of vanitie, one neyghbour neyghbour to: In tong they glose: it double gose, their hartes dissemble so. 3 All lips so vayne: God will them strayne, and plucke them vp by roote: Oh that he wrung: the boasting tunge, to treade it vnderfoote. 4 For thus they rayle we wyll preuayle, our tonges must matters breake: For who dare thus: be Lord to vs, our tonges must onely speake. 5 For thys the stresse: of comfortlesse, for sighes that poore men make: Now ryse wyll I: sayth God most hye, and helpe theyr part to take. 6 Gods worde is sure: it is as pure, from earth as siluer quit: Though tryde be golde: in fire seuen folde, his worde yet passeth it. 7 O Lord so graue: thou vs shalt saue, and euermore preserue: From all thys route: that be so stoute, for euer thee to serue. 8 These walke most wyde: in wycked pryde, all cruelty they frame: Whyle they so far exalted are, poore men be put to shame. Psalme. XIII. The Argument. For patience For Gods defence In trouble Dauid crieth Lest deadly might Should blynd his sight Good hope in God he spieth Vsquequo Domine. 1 How long wilt thou: forget me now, for euer Lord, my guyde? How long wylt thou: not me alow, how long thy face wylt hyde? 2 How long shall I: thus heauely, in soule seeke counsayle so? How long my hart: shall feele this smart, to be thus vext wyth foe. 3 O Lord my God: represse thy rod, heare now, consider mee: Myne eyes wyth lyght: O cleare thou bryght, dead sleepe lest they do see. 4 Lest that to hye: myne enemye, myght boast of hys preuayle: If downe I were: thys baratter, would ioye to see me quayle. 5 But all my trust: lyeth fully iust, in thy good mercy still: My hart thy helth: shall ioy it selfe, Gods goodnes laude I will. Psalme. XIIII. The Argument This Psalme set out The carelesse route of sinners obstinate How far asyde They wander wyde which hold with God debate Dixit insipiens. 1 The foole hath sayd: in hart astrayd, that God there is euen none: In workes they are: corrupt so far, not one doth good not one. 2 The Lord casth eye: from heauen to spye, the trade of Adams broode: If that as there: some wyse man were, which God would seeke so good. 3 But all astray: haue take theyr way, abominable made: There is not one: to do well, none they all from truth decayd. 4 For throtes they haue: lyke open graue, theyr tonges haue vsed deceyt: And vnderslips: theyr poyson lips, of Aspes the venome beyt. 5 Theyr mouthes do swim: wyth cursings brim all bitternes to fyll: Theyr feete make spede: mans bloud to shede, they force not whom they spyll. 6 Destruction: confusion, in all theyr wayes do ryse: Of peace no day: they know the way, Gods feare see not theyr eyes. 7 Haue they no mynd: in hart so blynd, in myschiefe how they go? Who lyke as meate: my people eate, and God they call not to. 8 But they shall there: be once in feare, where nought they feard in deede: For God is spide: most strong to bide, wyth iust mans righteous seede. 6 Where vaynly now: ye mocke and mow, at poore mans purpose iust: When he is bent: wyth fast entent, in God to put his trust. 7 Who els can speede: poore Iacobs seede, wyth helpe from Zyon hill: When God shall call hys people thrall, reioyce all Iury will. Psalme. XV. The Argument. Here Dauid craueth And answer haueth whom God alowth in sight The sprite so sayth Who hath a fayth to worke by loue aright Domine quis habitabit. 1 Who (Lord) shall byde: by thy sweete syde? In tabernacle sure? Or who shall styll: hold fast thy hyll, which holy doth endure? 2 Who walkth in state: immaculate, who blameles lyfe ensueth: And rightwise deede: fulfilth in speede, who speakth from hart the truth. 3 Whose tonge in spyte: doth not backebyte, ne doth hys neyghbour euill: Who cannot beare: wyth quyet eare, hys neyghbour slanderd still. 4 And he whose eyes: the bad despise, and lawdth Gods fearefull men: Who swearth also: hys neyghbour to, and chaungth not it ageyn. 5 Who will not plie: to vsurie, hys coyne for lucres loue: Who bribeth nothyng: the iust to wryng, oh he shall neuer moue. Psalme. XVI. The Argument. That Chrict did pray For his alway, and when himselfe did sue His buriall His rise withall the Prophet told full true Conserua me Domine. 1 O God of trust: preserue me iust, In soule and body to: For why to thee: my hope doth flee, to none els will I go. 2 O foule in sprite: thou saydst aright, to God who thee so wrought: My God thou art: of faythfull hart, my goodes can vayle thee nought. 3 All my delyght: to sayntes full bryght, is set, which trauell here: In vertues all: celestiall, they do excell so clere. 4 Who multiplie: theyr Idols hie, and after them do gad: Their sacrifice: I whole despise I hate theyr names so mad. 5 The Lord alone: is porcion, of myne inheritaunce: My cup he is: my crosse to blisse, my lot he wyll aduaunce. 6 My lot ful brode: by lyne and rod, so fayre did fall to mee: That I reioyce: the goodly choyce, myne heritage to see. 7 The Lord to blisse: I wyll not mysse, who gaue me counsayle so: My reynes by nyght: yet shewd me lyght, in thought to God to go. 8 In face I set: my God so great, he alwayes was my marke: For strong he standth: on my ryght hand, how can I fall in darke. 9 For helpe thus had: my harte was glad, my glory ioyed his fill: My flesh in graue: though earth it haueth, yet rest in hope it will. 10 For why in hell: my soule to dwell, thou wilt not leaue it there: The holy one: corruption to see, thou canst not beare. 11 Thou shalt shew mee: lyues path to see, and ioy in thy good sight: Thy ryght hand hase: all ioyfull grace, to stand for aye in might. Psalme. XVII. The Argument. That fayth myght stand In vpper hand the iust man prayth full fayne And museth in part That iust in hart thus should be vext in payne. Exaudi Deus. 1 Heare thou the right: O Lord my might, consider my complaynt: My lippes be streight: and hate deceight, geue eare to my constraynt. 2 Geue thou assent: to myne entent, in hand my right to take: Let thy good eye: my cause discrye, for thee my iudge I make. 3 My hart thou tridst: by nyght thou spidst, thou scorndst me nye in deed: Thou foundst not yet: my fault so great, my thought to mouth agreed. 4 Mens workes ful nought: by them so wrought agaynst thy worde and wyll: Made me to marke: theyr wayes most darke, thy lawes who do but spill. 5 O stay my feete: of lyfe most meete, thy worde to holde the path: Least wrong I walke: thy truth to balke, to slip in thy great wrath. 6 O God of all: on thee I call, for thou my sute wylt heare: Enclyne to mee: thy face so free, my wordes in hearyng beare. 7 Thy mercies great: extend thou yet, saue them whych trust in thee: From such as stand: agaynst thy hand, and vayne resisters bee. 8 As ball of eye: O tenderly, kepe me my Lord and kyng: And shadow me: so close to be, hyd vnder thy good wyng. 9 Defend me quyte: from all the spyte, of them that me molest: My foes I see: round compasse me, my soule to haue opprest. 10 So fat and fed: they iet so redde in wealth they stand full hye: Proud speeche to seeke: euen what they leeke, they walke disdaynfully. 11 In wayes they wayte: to note our gate, so set on euery side: They bend theyr eyes: as crafty spies on ground to cast vs wyde. 12 Lyke Lyon slye: they priuy lye, which greedy seekth his pray: As close it were: fierce wolfe or beare, or Lyons whelpe they lay. 13 For thy renowne: ryse, cast hym downe, destroy hys spyte O God: My soule O saue: from wycked slaue, who is thy sword and rod. 14 From men so fond: that be thy hond, O Lord from worldly beast: Who make good chere: thou filst them here, they leaue theyr babes the rest. 15 And I shall bold: thy face beholde, in righteousnes so bryght: I shall in deede: be satisfide, thy glory brought to lyght. Psalme. XVIII. The Argument Christ here in this For hym and his geueth thankes to God aright, For that they bee Deliuered free from all vngodly spight. Diligam te Domine. 1 I will loue thee: most inwardly, O Lord my strength thou art: Thy mercies all: both great and small, do comfort much my hart. 2 My Lord is hence: my rocke and fence, my sauyng God I say: My myght and shield: my trust in field, my horne of health, my stay. 3 The Lorde alwayes: most worthy prayes, on hym I mynde to call: So safe shall I: most stedfastly, escape myne enemies all. 4 The greuousnes: of deadly stresse, dyd compasse me about: The streames of sinne: so whelmd me in, they troubled me full out. 5 The paynes of hell: that were so fell, dyd me inclose full fast: The trappes and snares: of deadly cares, preuented me in hast. 6 In troublous wo: I cald vnto, my Lord my God in feare: To heare my case: his will it was, my cry euen toucht hys eare. 7 The earth did shake: for feare did quake, the hils theyr bases shooke: Remoued they were: in place most faire, at Gods ryght fearefull looke. 8 Darke smoke rose so: hys face there fro, hys mouth as fire consumde: That coales at it: were kyndled bryght, when he in anger fumde. 9 The heauens ful low: he made to bowe, and downe dyd he ensue: And darkenes great: was vnder set his feete in clowdy hue. 10 He rode on hye: and dyd so flye, vpon the Cherubins: He came in sight: and made hys flight, vpon the wyng of wyndes. 11 His place he set: In darkenes great, as secret there to byde: Wyth cloudes about: he set it out, wyth waters blacke beside. 12 At hys great light: of present sight, the cloudes past ouer quight: As stones of hayle: do melt and quayle, by coales in fire light. 13 The Lord from heauen: sent down his leauen and thundred thence in ire: He thunder cast: in wonders blast, wyth hayle and coales of fire. 14 With arrow dartes: he gald theyr hartes, and scatterd them about: And forth he bringes: hys lightnyngs, the Lord destroyd theyr rout. 15 When he dyd thret: the waters set, theyr springes to be dewrayed: The blastyng breath: of hys great wrath, the worldes deepe bottome shewd. 16 From heauen aboue: his grace and loue, to fetche me he dyd send: From waters deepe: he dyd me keepe, he dyd me strong defend. 17 He dyd represse: I saw no lesse my foes that strongest be: And rid me quite: of all theyr spite, to strong they were for me. 18 They dyd preuent: with troublement, the day of my great stresse: Yet Gods good hand: dyd them wythstand preuentyng theyr excesse. 19 In libertie: he placed mee, and led me strayght thereto: He brought me out: of stresse no doubt, hys grace dyd loue me so. 20 The Lord dyd thus: most gracious, my dealyng he aloude: He dyd me quite: as he in sight, me innocent approued. 21 For Gods true wayes: I kept alwayes, Hys law I trustd therto: Wyth my Lord God: I still abode, the wycked do not so. 22 I haue an eye: hys law to spye, from mans tradition: Nor hys precept: dyd I reiect, to my destruction. 23 And pure I went: wyth true entent, before my God also: I iust eschude: my deede so rude, I gaue good heede therto. 24 For doyng iust: my Lord I trust, will frendly me requite: My righteous deede: as well did speede, in hys approued sight. 25 As man is iust: so mayst thou trust, wyth good so good to bee: Wyth perfect man: so thou agayne, shall perfect be and free. 26 And thus wyth pure: thou mayst be sure, thou shalt be pure and cleane: Euen so wyth euill: of froward will, euen froward shalt thou meane. 27 For thou to saue: wilt soone wythsaue, the meeke in all theyr wo: And shalt deryde: mens stately pryde, and make them low to go. 28 For thou dydst lyght: my candell bryght, and keepst my fortune ryght: The Lord my God: dyd ease my rod, and darkenes tournd to lyght. 29 For strong to see: I was by thee, whole hostes to dyng downe ryght: In God no dout: I was so stout, stone wall to leape it quite. 30 Gods way I wis: vnspotted is, hys worde is tryde in fire: He is a shield: to man in field, who trust to hym intiere. 31 What God is there: euen any where, but this the Lord of hostes? What rocke excelth: in strength so well, as thys our God in coste? 32 For God euen he: round girdeth me, wyth strength and feate of warre: He keepth my way: in redy stay, lest vyce my lyfe should marre. 33 He makth my feete: as swyft and meete, as feete of hartes to see: In perfect grace: he stayd my race, and sate me vp on hye. 34 My handes aryght: he made to fyght, both diuell and man to wryng: Myne armes in partes: did breake their dartes yea bowes of steele wyth stryng. 35 Thy sauyng shield: kept me in field, thy right hand me sustaynd: Thy bounteousnes: dyd ease my stresse, though greuously it paynd. 36 Thou gauest me roume: where euer I come, to stand, to go, to ryde: Full strong to stand: on sea and land, my heeles dyd neuer slyde. 37 I dyd rechase: my foes in face, and ouer tooke theyr spyte: I dyd not stynt: wyth sword the dynt, till I had stroyed them quite. 38 I dyd them bray: in such aray, theyr woundes shall neuer heale: They could not ryse: in any wyse, but fall at myne owne heele. 39 Strait girdst thou me: wyth strength to be, to warre euen full inured: Thou threwest them round: vpon the ground my soule who thus pursude. 40 These noughty packes: did turne their backes theyr neckes thou madest me smight: My haters fell: thou didst them quell, downe thou dydst beat them right. 41 They cryde dismayde: and craued ayde, but none to helpe was there: Whan they did crie: to God so hie, then God did turne hys eare. 42 I dyd as small: thus beat them all, as dust before the wynde: As clay in streete: oft trode wyth feete, I dyd them stampe and grynde. 43 Thou rydst my lyfe: from peoples stryfe, thou didst me sure preserue: To Gentiles bred: thou madest me hed, straunge people me dyd serue. 44 When me they heare: at sound of eare, they me now soone obey: Wher children strange: their frendship change all falshoode they dewray. 45 These children strange: which strangely range so vp and downe dyd fayle: They all afrayd: in fearefull brayd, in theyr great forts shall wayle. 46 The Lord lyue hee: most blessedly who was my helper strong: God rowsed bee: my rocke so free, hym prayse I will full long. 47 This God of ours: he geueth me powers t'auenge my wycked foes: And doth subdue: my people true, that they like subiectes goes. 48 He daunted so: my cruell fo, to them he made me head: From wicked spite: thou dydst me quite, theyr wickednes to tread. 49 For thys O Lord: in hart and word, I will geue thankes in song: Of thy great name: thy power to fame, where Gentils dwel among. 50 Hys kyng he sought: he health hym wrought, he shewed true loue in deede: To Dauid true: annoynted due, and aye to his good seede. Psalme. XIX. The Argument. This Psalme deliteth Gods worke to cyte who is to sunne comparde His law it treateth And so it speaketh of his Apostles garde, Cœli enarrant. 1 The heauens do tell: how God excelth in glory, power, and might: The firmament: so excellent, his handy worke endight. 2 For day to day: succeedyng aye, doth playne hys power declare: As night to nyght: ensuyng ryght, setteth out hys louyng care. 3 No speche, or tong: to them doth long, theyr voyce distinct not hard: To magnifie: theyr Lord so hie, by languages regard. 4 But yet theyr sound: as wordes rebound, on all the earth it strayes: To further cost: all vttermost, their noyse theyr maker prayse. 5 In them he set: the sunne so net, lyke bridegrome which proceedth: His chamber out: as Giaunt stout, reioyceth hys course to speede. 6 His course goeth out: euen round about, the heauen and backe retreath: From East to West: it hath no rest, all thyng doth feele hys heate. 7 Gods law is iust: a law to trust, as spotlesse turnyng hartes: His wytnes pure: record is sure, to babe it wyt impartes. 8 The Lordes behest: is all the best, to ioy the hart in ryght: His biddinges be: so pure to see, blynd syght they turne to lyght. 9 The Lord his feare: is cleane and cleare, which euer shall endure: His iudgementes bee: the truth most free, and be themselues full sure. 10 They be to vs: more gracious, then gold or precious stone: To man more meete: then hony sweete, they passe the hony combe. 11 Yea more then this: thy seruant is, to keepe them alway prest: And sure shall he: rewarded be, wyth ioy whych is behest. 12 Synnes which be wrought: in deed &amp; thought, wythout thys law who knowth? Fro faultes that lye: oh secretly, thy clensing hand bestow. 13 From sinnes of pryde: thy seruant hyde, that me they do not guide: That vndefilde: and lesse beguilde, the great sinne myght I slyde. 14 My wordes thus said: my thoughts depe laid God graunt they please thy sight: O Lord my power: my rocke and bower, and my redemer quite. Psalme. XX. The Argument. This prayth for kinges Good prosperinges theyr realmes to haue defence, Where Christ is ment By fore entent of Dauids sprite in sence. Exaudiat te Dominus. 1 God graunt he heare: with blessed eare, thy sutes in day of wo: Gods name so great: whom Iacob met, promoote thee where thou go. 2 God send thee ayde: where power is layd, from sanctuary place: He strengtht thee sure: full strong t'endure, from Syon hill of grace. 3 Let hym keepe hye: in memorye, thy sacrifices all: The bullockes brent: so redolent, to mynde all them to call. Sela. 4 Graunt he thy will: of hart to fill, in sickenes eke and health: Confirme he shall: thy counsayles all, to worke thy peoples wealth. 5 In helth of thee: glad we shal bee, and triumphes make we will: In gods good name: his prayse to fame, thy vowes God shall fulfill. 6 I know that now: God will allowe, his Christ and saue him deare: To heare him nye: from heauen so hye, by healthfull hand he bearth. 7 Some trust their horse: some charets force, thus they presume of strength: But we wyll bynde: Gods name in mynde, for he is Lord at length. 8 For where we see: how low they bee, and falne, so foule deceyued: We ryse in sight: and stand vpright, by myght of God receyued. 9 O Lord we sing: saue, keepe the king, heare vs and saue vs aye: Both hym and his: preserue and blis, his realme defend we pray. Psalme. XXI. The Argument. Here is exprest How that request is hard which went beforne Now thankes the more He geueth therfore to see hys foes forlorne. Domine in virtute. 1 The king with voyce: doth most reioyce, thy strength O Lord most kynde: For health so had: he is full glad, excedingly in mynde. 2 Thou hast him geuen: such helpe to wynne, in hart as he desyrde: For that he sought: by thee was wrought, as full his lips requirde. Sela 3 Thy good entent: dyd hym preuent, thy blessyng sweete thou gauest: Upon his hed: a crowne so red, of gold well set thou hast. 4 He asked lyfe: and lyfe ful ryfe, thou gauest him that will last: More hym thou gaue: then he dyd craue, euen lyfe that shall not wast. 5 His honour great: in thee is set, in thy saluation true: Thou didst him crowne: with bright renowne and glory hym dyd sue. 6 Thou hast againe: exalt hys raygne, wyth long felicitie: To glad hys state: most fortunate, with ioy thy face to see. 7 The cause is thys: the kyng I wis, in God dyd put his trust: Hys louyng grace: so steyd hys place, no man could downe hym thrust. 8 Thy strong ryght hand: by sea and land, shall all thy foes confound: Thou shalt seeke out: thy haters stout, wyth power to cast on ground. 9 In thyne whote ire: as ouen wyth fire, thou shalt them make to fume: The Lord in wrath: shall stroy theyr pathe, the fire shall them consume. 10 Thou shalt supplant: theyr fruite to want, theyr rootes from earth full low: Theyr seede euen quyte: from all mens sight, no man thence shall them know. 11 For they entend: on thee to send, some euill in spitefull fourme: Theyr cursed deede: yet wanted speede, they could not it perfourme. 12 For such a thyng: thou shalt O kyng, them all put foule to flight: Thou shalt bestow: thy stryng and bow, agaynst theyr face to smite. 13 O Lord of helth: exalt thy selfe, in thyne owne strength and might: So wyll we syng: to thee O kyng, to prayse thy power aright. Psalme. XXII. The Argument. Lo Dauid here, Christes type doth beare in anguishe all be set For here in summe Christes passion and rising iust be met Deus deus meus. 1 My God my God: regard me God, why hast me left alone? To make so farre: my health to iarre from wordes of my great mone? 2 My God I cry: as day doth pry, and yet thou geuest none eare: No rest by night I take in sight, no silence any where. 3 Yet holdst thy will: in thee so still? as onely good thy selfe? Thou Iacobs prayse: thy selfe vp rayse, they sang alwayes thy health. 4 Our fathers olde: on thee were bolde, to hope, and had theyr ease: As oft as they: to thee did pray, theyr troubles then dyd cease. 5 They cald on thee: and helpe therby, thou gauest to them anone: They layd theyr trust: on thee so iust, and scapt confusion. 6 Concernyng mee: a worme to see, I am, no man of pryce: A scorne all day: a cast away, of men in theyr deuyce. 7 All they that mee: wyth eye dyd see, hye scornes to me they layd: Wyth lips they mowd: with knees they bowd they shooke theyr hed and sayd. 8 In God he set: affiaunce great, let hym than rid hym quyte: Deliuer hee: to make hym free, for hym he pleasth in sight. 9 Yet he thou art: that dydst depart, my mothers wombe from me: At both her brestes in quyet rest, thou nurst me tenderly. 10 I was whole cast: on thee full fast, from that my mothers pappe: No dout from thence: in sure defence, thou God keptst me in lappe. 11 Fro me to go: oh do not so, for trouble is at hand: No helpe of man: optayne I can, in thee my refuge standth. 12 Wylde buls most stout: flocke me about, by me full fierce they ryde: Fat buls in deede: as Basan feede, be set on euery side. 13 My death to shape: wyth mouthes they gape, on me they stare I say: They swell and stampe: as Lyons rampe, when they do rore at pray. 14 Out am I cast: as water wast, my bones in ioyntes be lose: My hart wythin: doth melt and pyne, as waxe by fier dose. 15 As potsherd dry: my strength doth lye, to mouth my tong cleau'th fast: To death in dust: thou hast me thrust, thus made I am agast. 16 Yea dogs full grim: haue closde me in, in councels mad they meete: Besiegd I stand: of wicked hand, they pearst my hand and feete. 17 My bones to tell: I may full well, at me they gase and stare: They did delite: in my despite, they dyd deryde my care. 18 My clothes they part: wyth ioyfull hart, as spoyle the sowgiers do: For that my cote: they cast theyr lot, for that vnsowed was so. 19 But be not far: my gouerner, O Lord my castle strong: Thy mercy send: and me defend, in hast, no tyme prolong. 20 From sworde and knyfe: discharge my lyfe, my soule lest they deuoure: Keepe well my soule: as derlyng fole, from dogges theyr handes and power. 21 O kepe in awe: the Lyons iawe, saue me from them that byte: From all the hornes of Unicornes, protect me Lord of myght. 22 Thy power and name: I shall declame, to all my bretherne met: Glad wyll I rayse: in church thy prayse, in congregation set. 23 The Lord who fearth: with lawds draw nere, all Iacobs seede hym prayse: Feare ye hym well: all Israell, hym magnify alwayes. 24 He wyll aduise: and not despise, the poore for low degree: He hydth no face: in tyme and place, my prayer heard hath hee. 25 I purpose mee: to speake of thee, in church thy prayse to sprede: My vowes so plight: in iust mens sight, I will perfourme in dede. 26 The meeke his brede: shall eate full fed, and prayse the Lord all day: For God who seekth: hys prayse he keepth, theyr hart shall lyue for aye. 27 The world so brode: will turne to God, whyle thys they call to hart: Before hys face: all folke in place, shall honour hym impart. 28 All kyngdomes stand: to God as bond, theyr trybes and kynredes eke: And them in raigne: he shall retayne, all quarters them to seke. 29 The fat shall fede: and serue in drede, they all shall worshyp ryfe: Yea dead men all: to hym shall fall, who gaue theyr soules no lyfe. 30 My seede and bloud: thys Lord so good shall serue in worship free: And thus my stocke: as God hys flocke, shall iust reputed bee. 31 They shall proceede: to shew in deede, to people thence to come: Gods iustice great: from heauenly seat, what he to them hath done. Psalme. XXIII. The Argument. The Christen man Confesse he can how God his lyfe doth guide With meat so good of heauenly foode from death his soule to hide. Dominus regit. 1 The Lord so good: who geueth me food my shepeheard is and guide: How can I want: or suffer scant, whan he defendth my side? 2 To feede my neede: he will me lead, in pastures greene and fat: He forth brought me: in libertie, to waters delicate. 3 My soule and hart: he did conuert, to me he sheweth the path: Of rightwisenes: in holines, his name such vertue hath. 4 Yea though I go: through death hys wo, his vaale and shadow wyde: I feare no dart: wyth me thou art, wyth staffe and rod to guide. 5 Thou shalt prouyde: a table wyde, for me agaynst theyr spite: With oyle my head: thou hast bespred, my cup is fully dight. 6 Thy goodnes yet: and mercy great, will kepe me all my dayes: In house to dwell: in rest full well, wyth God I hope alwayes. Psalme. XXIIII. The Argument. Of Christ to come All whole in summe his raigne this psalme doth preach How God will bee In temple free the letter this doth teach. Domini est terra. 1 The earth it is: the Lordes of blisse, wyth all the garnishyng: The world so round: he hath it found, and all that dwell therin. 2 This earth he cast: on seas so fast, as ouer them to stand: And floudes he made: for corne and blade, and eke to part the land. 3 Up who shall stye: on hill so hye, where resteth thys Lord of grace? Or who shall ryse: in restfull wyse, to that his holy place? 4 Euen he whose hand: and hart doth stand, in cleannes innocent: Who sought no gayne: in fansies vayne. nor othe hath falsly ment. 5 He shall posses: in stablenes, the Lordes sweete blessednes: Hys God of health: from euen hymselfe, shall send hym righteousnes. 6 And these be they: which seeke alway, in stocke theyr God in deede: Euen truely they: who seke I say, the God of Iacobs seede. 7 Lift vp your gates: you heades and states, ye lastyng dores aryse: In at this house: kyng glorious, wyll enter princely wyse. 8 What is this kyng: thus enteryng, wyth glory thus beset? The Lord is hee: full strong to see, a Lord in battayle great. 9 Arise I say: thou temple gay, though I thee cannot builde: Or as the vij. verse. Yet ioyth my sprite: that God of might, hys arke shall be thy shield. 10 What is thys king: desiering, wyth glory thus to raigne? The Lorde of hostes: of glory most, the kyng and soueraigne. Sela Psalme. XXV. The Argument. This cry and call Is Generall as supplication graue It doth confesse Done wickednes and pardon craueth to haue At te Domine. 1 O Lord to thee: my soule to flee, is set, my God thou art: I whole referre: my lyfe most nare to thee, wyth all my hart. 2 My God of sence: my confidence, on thee was alway borne: O let no shame: confound my name, my foes els will me scorne. 3 Who trustth in thee: ashamd to bee, can neuer man it spye: Who breake thy lawes: without a cause, confounded let them lye. 4 Shew me thy wayes: O Lord alwayes, of truth me teach the path: Thy word and way: is certayne stay, for that all vertue hath. 5 In truth me lead: teach me thy read, my God of health thou art: My trust doth lay: in thee all day, to thee is bent my hart. 6 Call thou to mynde: O Lord full kynde, thy louyng mercies olde: Thy bounties free: which euer bee, as fathers them haue tolde. 7 Of youth my faut: so great and haut, such sinne O Lord forget: For mercy sake: O Lord awake, thy mynd vpon me set. 8 Both gratious: and righteous, the Lord is equall so: He teachth wyth rod: yet louyng God, by giftes he teachth also. 9 Who meeke abyde: them he will guide, in iudgement good and ryght: And whome we see: most gentle bee, his wayes he teachth them lyght. 10 The wayes of God: be large and brode, both truth and mercy iust: Euen still to such: as loueth much, his hestes, and couenauntes trust. 11 For thy names sake: O mercy take, my Lord vpon my sinne: It is so great: it doth me fret, it boylth my soule wythin. 12 What man he bee: that feareth thee, O Lord thou wylt hym teach: The rightfull way: to choose I say, in sprite thereto to retche. 13 His soule shall dwell: at ease full well, in ghostly free delyght: Hys stocke and seede: shall neuer neede, but hold the land to ryght. 14 Among them lye: Gods secrecy, to feare hym who that shall: In gentle fourme: he wyll perfourme, to them hys couenantes all. 15 Myne eyes entent: is euer bent to thee my Lord so great: For onely he: pluckth suerly, my feete from out of net. 16 Turne thou to mee: O Lord so free, haue mercy, stay my fall: I am in state: all desolate, in misery full thrall. 17 My sorrowes fell: my hart doth swell, they be enlarged so: My troublous payne: O God restrayne, O quenche this deadly wo. 18 Attend I cry: my misery, my lyfe and state aduerse: Forgeue my fautes: which me assautes, my ioy to me reuerse. 19 Consider ryght: my foes theyr spyte, how they increase my feare, Theyr hate is thus: so tyrannous, at me that they do beare. 20 O kepe most dere: my soule intiere, and me deliuer iust: So let no shame: confound my name, for I in thee haue trust. 21 Let perfectnes: and rightfulnes, both guide and wayte on mee: My trust for ayde: in thee is layd, from me O neuer flee. 22 Deliuer well: all Israell, O God wyth all hys seede: From troubles all: that them may fall, in thee alway to speede. Psalme. XXVI. The Argument. The iust mans song Who suffreth wrong for righteousnes beshent: And prayth in will That he may still a lyfe leade innocent. Iudica Domine. 1 Lord iudge my deed: as I haue lyued in thee my hope is all: For this my trust: in thee so iust, I neuer doubt to fall. 2 Lord proue my waye: and me assaye, by fire trye thou my reynes: And search my hart: my foe is smart, myne giltles life he straynes. 3 Thy clemency: was nye myne eye, to stay, me right to do: I dyd inure: my hart full sure, to truth from lyes to go. 4 Wyth lyers vayne: I would not trayne, my lyfe to follow such: Wyth crafty men: I would not renne, whose lyfe dissembleth much. 5 The wycked rout: that goeth about, to harme and hurt I hate: I will not set: in councell yet, wyth men of wycked state. 6 For washe I wyll: my handes euen still, wyth men of perfect lyfe: And thus shall I: O Lord so hye, frequent thyne aulters ryfe. 7 Where I shall rayse: thy worthy prayse, that men may loue the same: I wyll there sprede: thy grace in deede, the workes of thy good name. 8 O Lord the place: where restth thy grace, I haue the bewty loued: Thy heauenly house: so glorious, I loued as me behoued. 9 Wyth sinners great: Lord do not shet, my soule, wyth them to bee: Thy grace extend: my lyfe defend, all men of bloud to flee. 10 Theyr handes do presse: all wyckednes, euen guile prepensed so: Theyr better hand: corrupt doth stand, wyth brybes, euen thus they go. 11 But yet will I: most certenly, in truth my lyfe addresse: O make me free: from them to bee, shew me thy tendernes. 12 My foote as yet: in ryght is set, in playne simplicitie: And still wyll I: in company, exalt thee Lord on hie. Psalme. XXVII. The Argument. Here may we see The iust is free in trouble though he falleth: In God he stayeth On hym he wayeth and so geueth thankes in all. Dominus illuminatio 1 The Lord of might: is health and light, to me (at nede) whom should I feare? The Lord is strength: to lyfe at length, of myne (I say) who can me deare? 2 Whan men so bad: theyr traynes had layd, Euen then (at eye) they fell downe right: Whan foes dyd presse: to eate my flesh, they slid (away) for all theyr spite. 3 Though armed host: besiegd my cost, my hart (from God) shall not relent: Though cruell warre: should ryse me nar, to God (therin) I would be bent. 4 One thing to craue: of God to haue, I dyd (full oft) and aye I will: To keepe hys place: to see hys grace, to haunt (euen so) his temple still. 5 Thus shal hys power: hyde me in bower, when troubles should be (fierce and) fell: He would me hyde: there close to byde, as safe on rocke (most sure) to dwell. 6 My hed yet now: he wyll alow, aboue my foes (in state) alwayes: In, will I bryng: glad offeryng, the Lord (so good) to laud and prayse. 7 My voyce O heare: my Lord so deare, I cry (my God) in wofull part: Graunt that I craue: and mercy haue, extend to me thy (louyng) hart. 8 My hart to thee: dyd oft apply, seeke ye my face (I say) ye all: O Lord I will: thy face seeke still, do others (how and) what they shall. 9 Hyde not from mee: thy seruaunt free, thy (louyng) face, my ayde thou art: Proiect not me: displeasantly, O Lord (my health) do not depart. 10 My parentes when: they bad me renne, from them (to go) my selfe to shift: When Patrons all: my reyse or fall, rought not (a myte) thou dydst me lyft. 11 Teach me thy way: thy law I say, that rightly leadth (in truth) to thee: My foes O Lord: wyth one accorde, should els reioyce (in hate) to free. 12 Up turne me not: to beare theyr hate, O Lord (to them) that me pursue: False witnes eyes: agaynst me ryse, and lyes (of me) they sprede vntrue. 13 My hart had quayld: and vtter fayld, if fast (to thee) I had not trustd: Let me thy grace: Lord see in place, in land (of rest) where ioyth the iust. 14 O wayte the Lord: hold fast hys worde: doubt not (at all) be strong, be still: Attend on God: take meeke hys rod, he will (at last) thy hart fulfill. Psalme. XXVIII. The Argument. This mans entent Is vehement all crafty men to scape: And hard he is From God of blisse for this he thankes doth shape. Ad te Domine. 1 O Lord I cry: my rocke on hye, rest not (thus still) forsake me not: Or els should I: resemble nye, the deede (that be) in pit bewrapt. 2 Heare my request: of humble brest, whan I (so meeke) do sue to thee: Agaynst thy seate: of mercy sweete, my handes (on hye) when lift they bee. 3 And draw my hart: from wycked part, wyth them (O Lord) that worke so euill: Theyr tonge cryth truse: which hart refuseth, theyr myndes all set to (stroy and) spill. 4 As is theyr deede: so let them speede, retort their craftes they (vse to) delue, Theyr malice great: the same to get, wyth lyke (by ryght) to quite themselue. 5 Theyr myndes disdayne: Gods actes to fraine hys (stately) workes to marke euen so: He shall them stroy: and not employ, theyr lyues (no tyme) in wealth to go. 6 Well worthy prayse: is God alwayes, my mouth (in song) shall hym forth sound: He heard my grone: my prayers mone, he dyd not me (wyth shame) confound. 7 God is my shield: my strength in field, he helpt (me iust) as I beleued: For this good chance: my hart may daunce, and sing in laudes (so wel) releaued. 8 To my small host: God praysd be most, that (tymely) health he soone dyd bryng: The Lord is strength: and fence at length, to his (most true) annoynted kyng. 9 Thy people saue: O Lord I craue, and blesse (wyth ioy) thyne heritage: Feede them as guide: promoote them wyde, to prayse thee (God from) age to age. Psalme. XXIX. The Argument. This doth inuite, All stately might to note Gods mighty power: Hym iust to serue Who can preserue and els can them deuoure. Afferte Domino. 1 Ye sonnes of God: sprede ye abrode, the Lordes great power and strength: Bryng ye your lambes: of mighty rambes to God hys laudes at length. 2 The Lord ensue: wyth honor due, extoll his myght and name: And eke expresse: his holines, hym laude in court of fame. 3 His voyce so grand: on sea and land, note how the floudes it stayd: Gods maiesty: you then dyd see, on them when thunder brayd. 4 Hys voyce rulth sea: how houge it be, hys voyce is sterne and stout: His voyce is thus: most glorious, when it dryueth leuyn out. 5 This voyce so free: breakth Cedre tree, no force can it repell: It dryueth euen downe: of Lybanon, hys Cedres, though they swell. 6 He made them skip: in rootes to flip, as calues do vse to praunce: So Lybanon: and Syrion, as Unicorne to daunce. 7 The Lord by voyce: the fiery noyce, of flames in partes can send: The cloudes among: he lightneth strong, wyth shoures he fyre can blend. 8 It can distres: all wyldernes, yea Cades desert wyde: The beastes I say: which there do stray, it make themselfe to hyde. 9 This voyce doth bynde: to calue the Hynde, thicke trees it open layth: Therfore men all: in temple shall, hys honour prayse in fayth. 10 Where they shall sing: that God as kyng, hath rule of waters all: On whom he setth: as kyng is fit, and so for euer shall. 11 The Lord all wealth: and stable health shall geue hys people kynde: God them shall blesse: wyth full increase, all peace and rest to fynde. Psalme. XXX. The Argument. Thankes here be ment To God so sent for iust deliueraunce: And here ye spie All suertie in Gods good gouernaunce. Exaltabo te Domine. 1 Lord thee all whole: I will extoll, for thou hast lift me hye: Thou wouldst not make: my foes to crake, agaynst me ioyfully. 2 O Lord of myght: my God of ryght, to thee I cryed in griefe: Thou gauest an eare: to heare me neare, thou sentst me healthes reliefe. 3 Thou broughtst ful wel: my soule from hell, O Lord thou didst wythsaue: Thou me releuest: my strength thou kepest, thou pluckst me quyte from graue. 4 To God sing ye: ye saintes agree, hys prayses eleuate: And mynde ye still: hys holy will, his graces celebrate. 5 Hys heauy wrath: short time it hath, lyfe standth at hys good grace: At nyght we weepe: yet after sleepe, at morne we myrth embrace. 6 Whan well I was: in ioyfull case, I sayd as then I thought: That I no day: should fele decay, and neuer moue to nought. 7 For thy good will: so strenghtd my hill, O Lord most stedfastly: But whan thy face: had tournd hys grace, I than fell troublously. 8 In thys my payne: I was full fayne, to cry to thee for might: My God wyth cry: I dyd apply, and prayd both day and nyght. 9 What gayne sayd I: hath lyfe thereby, if death cut short my dayes: Can dust declare: thy power in care? in graue to tell thy prayse? 10 My God therfore: spare me the more, O Lord I thee desire: My simple sprite: despyse not quyte, but helpe I thee requyre. 11 Thou tournst from mee: my wo and gree, to myrth in cherefull voyce: The mournyng weede: thou changest in deede so fensd I dyd reioyce. 12 Wherfore euen still: all good men will, thy glory sing and prayse: O Lord of loue: my God aboue, I thee wyll laude alwayes. Psalme. XXXI. The Argument. Thus Dauid prayed from Saule so scapte: in letter thankth he so: But Christ is ment: vvith all hys church: for sprite &amp; bodies vvo In te Domine. 1 In thee O Lord I put my trust: let me neuer be shamde: Rid me in thy true righteousnes: which thou for me hast framde. 2 Bow downe thine eare make hast to me: deliuerd that I be: Be thou my fort, my rocke so ferme: so stabled iust by thee. 3 Thou art my rocke &amp; castell sure: my fortres large and wide: For thy names sake lord lead me forth: be thou my light and guide. 4 My foote O Lord draw out of net: full priuy set for me: Thou art my strength as I haue said: al hope doth rest in thee. 5 To thy good hands I yelde my sprite: O lord to thy great ruthe, Thou hast redemd me certenly: O lord thou God of truthe. 6 I hate their superstition: who holde of vanitie, where iust hath bene my confidence: O Lord alway in thee. 7 I will be glad and eke reioyce: for thyne humanitie: For thou didst note my soules distresse: my state aduerse to see. 8 In cruell hand of deadly foes: thou hast not shut me vp: But set my feete at large in roume: thou temperstd so my cup. 9 Haue mercy Lord vpon my wo: myne eyes therin consume: My soule and eke my body sore: much payne they do resume. 10 My lyfe is wast in heauines: my yeares in mournynges wayle: My strength is falne for myne offence: my bones beginne to quayle 11 A scorne I am among my foen: but most to neyghbourhed: A feare I was to daily frende: seene out of dores they fled. 12 I am so cleane cast out of mynd: as dead man layd in graue: I am become a vessel broke: which no man list to haue. 13 I saw so great conspiracy: of men in counsayle met: My feare encreast whan they dyd rise: my soule to trap in net. 14 But yet my hope hath bene in thee: O Lord I thus dyd say, Thou art my God my trusty God: thou wilt me kepe for aye. 15 My dayes be set in thy good handes: ryd me from all my foes: Whose handes be set to persecute: to lade my soule wyth woes. 16 Thy gentle light of countinance: shew me thy seruaunt poore: Saue me O Lord by mercy great: I trust therto the more. 17 And let me not confounded be: O Lord of thee I craue: Confounded be all wicked men: in silence put to graue. 18 Let lyeng lips be stopt to speake: to whist downe lowe be thrust: In cruell spite disdaynfully: they prate agaynst the iust. 19 How is thy grace so plentifull, prepard in store to bee: For righteous men which thee do feare: as Adams broode may see. 20 To hide them safe euen iust by thee: from all prouokyng men: Thine eies in house will kepe them sure: from tonges y? venim [illeg.] 21 O thankes be due to this the Lord: whose pity such I felt: As I with forte were closed in: or I in citye dwelt. 22 Though whan I fled and felt excesse: I sayd thou me despisde: Yet when I cryde thou heardst my voyce: in humble sute deuisde. 23 O Loue the Lord ye all his saintes: the Lord the iust preseruth, The doer prowd he thorowly: rewardth as he deseruth. 24 Be strong in hart: most manfully, For he your hartes shall strength: All ye that wayte the Lord so good, O trust ye hym at length. Psalme. XXXII. The Argument. Here Dauid teachth to vnderstande, what is cleare blessednes: Euen pardon free at Gods good hande, for all our sinnefulnes. Beati quorum remisse. 1 O blest be they: whose trespaces, all whole remitted lye: Whose sinne is hid: in secrecies, from which God turnth his eye. 2 O blessed man to whom in sight, God doth impute no sinne: Who hath no guile: in suttle sprite, as hypocrite within. 3 For that my sinne: I hyd so blynde, and would not it confesse: My bones and strength for sorrow pynde, all day I cryed in stresse. 4 For dayes and nyghtes: thy heauy hand, my soule dyd presse so stout: That all my powers: and moysture changd as dryed by sommer drout. Sela 5 I shewed to thee: my wyckednes, not still my gilt I hid: I sayd: I will my fault expresse, then straight thou it didst ryd. Sela 6 For this to thee: will euery saynt, make sute in tyme of grace: Though waters flow: in deepe constraynt, they shall not hym deface. 7 My refuge thou: art couertly, from trouble me to bryng: Thus fenst by thee: glad sing shall I, as men made free do sing. Sela 8 I will geue thee: intelligence, right thee to teach the way: That thou mayst walke: wythout offence, on thee myne eye shall stay. 9 But be not lyke the horse and mule, who nought can vnderstand: Whose mouthes wyth bittes except ye rule, they wyll not come to hand. 10 The wycked man: wyth cares is fret, wyth sorrowes fouly vext: But who hys trust: in God hath set, to hym all grace is next. 11 In thys the Lord: reioyce ye still, ye righteous men be glad: All ye that haue: ryght hartes and wyll, ioy ye be not adrad. Psalme. XXXII. The Argument. Here hily aduanst Gods grace do ye see: Who sinne doth remit, All wholy so free. Beati quorum. 1 O happy be they, Whose sins be releast: This psalm aforesaid in an other Metre. Who hath theyr offence Whole hyd by request. 2 And happy the man Whom God doth aquite: Whose sprite hath no guile To doubt of hys might. 3 For holding my tong, My bones fell away: I gronde in my hart, All whole by the day. Sela. 4 By nyght and by day, Thy hand was to stout: My moysture was dryed Lyke sommer the drout. Sela. 5 My cryme I bewrayed Euen iust in thy sight: I hyd not my gylt, But brought it to light. I cast wyth my selfe, My fault to reueale: And straight thou releast, It euery deale. 6 For this shall we see, All saintes to desire: In sute for to bee When tyme doth require. Though trouble aryse, as flouds when they grow Yet shall they no tyme, The iust ouerflow. 7 My bower thou art, To keepe me at ease: Thou fencest me about, With songes of release. Sela 8 To teache thee I will, And guide thee the way: On thee will I looke, So neuer to stray. 9 But be ye not lyke, The horse and the mule: For brutish they be And hard to recule. Wyth bridle and bit Their mouthes do ye strain Lest at you they wynce And turne so agayne. 10 The bad shal haue plages On euery side: Who trust in the Lord, Them grace doth abide. 11 Ye men of the ryght, Be glad to reioyce: Ye true men in hart, Be ioyfull in voyce. Psalme. XXXIII. The Argument. The iust alway in mynde bearth this, Wyth hart to ioye in God of his, To prayse his name that mighty is, For he geueth helpe and heauenly blis: But vayne all other remedies, But payne all worldly policies, Remember this. Exultate iusti in. 1 Reioyce in God: the Lord he is, Ye rightwise men and do not mis, The iust be bound to thanke iwis. Repete ye this 2 Prayse ye the Lord: wyth melodies, Wyth harpe and lute wyth simphonies, Syng Psalmes to hym in Psalteries. Forget not this. 3 Syng Carols new wyth iubilie, To God the Lord in maiestie, Hys laudes, hys prayse, sing hartely. Well vse ye this. 4 His worde is true most certeinly, His workes be wrought most faythfully: Holde thys in hart most constantly. Abuse not this. 5 He iudgement loueth: and right entent, The earth therwith is all besprent, Such grace and loue he downe hath sent, Well trust ye this. 6 The heauens were made: by thys the Lord, The hostes of them: by hys true word, Hys breth of mouth: theyr power afordth. Distrust not thys. 7 The seas on heapes: he doth them place, As bottell close: he them embraceth The depes he coutcht in secret space. Denounce ye this. 8 Let all the earth: the Lord ifeare, What man this world and mould doth beare, Serue hym in dread: wyth gentle eare. Renounce not thys. 9 He spake the word: and done it was, The earth firme stoode in stable case, What he dyd byd: it came to passe, Reuolue ye thys. 10 All Paynyms wayes God doth reiect, Uayne peoples dryftes by hym be chect: Proude Prynces craftes he doth detect. Dissolue not thys. 11 Gods counsayles aye shall all abyde, Hys thoughtes of hart shall neuer slyde: From tyme to tyme on neyther syde. Respect ye thys. 12 What folke hath God Iehoua Lord, Elect as heyre by hys accord, O blest they be by truthes record. Suspect not thys. 13 The Lord from heauen beholdth vs all, All kynde of men both free and thrall: He seeth theyr reyse: he seeth theyr fall. Aduise ye thys. 14 From his high seat: he castth hys eyes, All men to vewe theyr tract to spye, Where euer they in earth do lye. Despise not thys. 15 The hartes of all he shope no dout, He knowth theyr thoughts wythin wythout, Theyr workes what they do go about. Repute ye thys. 16 No kyng is saued by route of host, No giaunt strong for all hys bost, Of strength and power though haue they most Dispute not thys. 17 Strong horse is thyng: but weake agayne, That man by hym myght safe remayne, Both horse and man are all but vayne. Approue ye thys. 18 Behold the Lord: holdth eye full iust, On fearefull men whych hym do trust, Wyth grace them guide he safely must. Disproue not thys. 19 Theyr soule from death to ryd them quite, In tyme of dearth to feede them ryght All paynfull stresse he makth full lyght. Betrouth ye thys 20 Our soule hath taryed quietly, For thys our God assuredly, Our guide, our shield most trustely. Forslouth not thys. 21 Our hartes in hym wyll styll reioyce, For hys good name we trust the choyce, And sing we will in ioyfull noyce. Repete ye thys. 22 Extend O Lord thy gentlenesse, As we in thee haue trustinesse, Thou art the Lord of ryghteousnes. Forget not thys. Psalme. XXXIIII. The Argument. When Dauid fledde, to Achis king, At death he was full neere: And saued yet, this Psalme did sing, With all his frendes in quiere. Benedic? dominum. 1 I will geue thankes: to God alwayes, Who raignes in power most hie: Within my mouth: shall be hys prayse, declarde continuallie. 2 Of thys good Lord: to bost the fame, My soule shall neuer lynne: The humble sort: shall heare the same, And eke reioyce therein. 3 O laude and prayse: the liuyng Lord, wyth me performe his prayse: And let vs all: wyth free accorde, extoll hys name alwayes. 4 I sought the Lord: and when I cryde, he bowde hys louyng eare: Yea, he me keepes, eche tyme and tyde, and dyd me rid from feare. 5 Lo, thus to God: the poore doth call, his cry he doth regarde: And he from paynes and wofull thrall, likewyse doth hym awarde. 6 They had an eye: full bent in hym, and so they lightened were: A shamefast face not one of them, from that tyme forth dyd beare. 7 Gods aungels standes hym round about, whose lyfe him fearth aryght: No harme they take, by wycked route, he them deliuereth quyte. 8 O tast and see: how gratious, the Lord remayneth iust: That man is blest: all prosperous, that layes on hym hys trust. 9 O feare the Lord: ye sainctes of his, therin your trauayle plant: For they that feare: the Lord of blis, shall nothyng euer want. 10 The Lyons neede: wyth hunger fret, the ryche and proud in hart: But he whose feare: in God is set, of all good thynges haue part. 11 Ye children yong: approche ye neare, geue eare vnto my worde: I wyll you learne, the Lord to feare, in godly hartes accorde. 12 What man he be: that list to liue, and fayne would see good dayes: Let hym no fraude: in tongue atchieue, in lewde and frowarde wayes. 13 Reiect the euill: and take the good, all wycked wayes eschue: Seeke pleasaunt peace: wyth modest moode, and do the same ensue. 14 Upon the iust: and godly men, the Lorde hys eyes doth splay: And boweth hys eares: as God to them, as oft as they do pray. 15 Gods face is seene, most irefully, to wycked men of hand: To roote full out: theyr memory, from all the earth to stand. 16 To God the Lord: the righteous call, who heares theyr heauy case: And he from cares: and troubles all, deliuereth them by grace. 17 The Lord is nie, to hym by might, that is contrite in hart: And saueth the man: of humble sprite, nor will from hym depart. 18 Great are the cares: of perfect men, and great theyr troubles bee: But yet the Lord: deliuereth them from all aduersitie. 19 He keepth theyr bones: both safe and sound, Unbroken them to saue: The euil, euil happes: shall all confound, no stay by God to haue. 20 The Lord will keepe: his seruauntes all, theyr soules he wyll defend: And none shall be in sorrow thrall, who iust to hym doth bend. Psalme. XXXIIII. The Argument. When Dauid fledde to Achis king, At death the doore he was full neere, And saued yet this Psalme dyd sing Wyth all his frendes in godly quiere, To God hys Lorde, to hym so dere, In voyces clere, with hart and will. Geue thankes I will. For the Lute. This psalm aforesaid in an other Metre. Benedic? dominum. Note the reuoluti?s of sixe diuers terminations. 1 Geue thankes I will: geue thankes I will, For aye to God most gratious, He is my forte, my rocke on hill My Lord he is most bounteous, My mouth shall prayse hym plenteous, In hart and mynde most feruent still. Geue thankes I will. 2 My soule may boast: of this my Lord, He was my helpe so trustelie, Let meeke men heare wyth one accorde: Let wofull men ioye willingly, That God hath done so louingly, From whom all grace doth downe distill. Geue thankes I will. 3 Prayse ye the Lorde wyth hart and voyce, With me ye see hys gentlenes, Together come, let vs reioyce, To laude hys name in faythfulnes, Lyke ayde to you he wyll expresse, To keepe from you, all troublous ill. Geue thankes I will. 4 I sought the Lord he sent me ease, He hard my griefe and all my payne, He pluckt me forth of all disease, That deadly gript my hart the vayne, He rid my feare, he turnd agayne, For I hym sought with all my skill. Geue thankes I will. 5 I fledde to hym, and sawe his light, Who eye did cast to his good grace, All lightened were with visage bright, Confounded not were they in face, No payne no spite could them disgrace, God them defendes, none can them spill. Geue thankes I will. 6 God hard my crye as sweete incense, I poore man lo felt this in part, He geueth all blisse, he quith offence, He bade all wo from me depart, Of troublous paine to quench the dart, Right sone he did his worde fulfill. Geue thankes I will. 7 Gods host stode by to strength my fight, For angels power most glorious, About the iust lie strong in myght, To make hym goe victorious, To scape theyr foes so quarilous, Hys power in grace endureth still. Geue thankes I wil. 8 O taste and see he none forsakth, Gods goodnes smelleth most fragrantly, To whom who wyll themselfe betake, O blest they go ryght happelie, Who trust in hym assuredlie, To them all helpe shall downe distill. Geue thankes I will. 9 O feare the Lord in childelie feare, Ye saintes of hys in holines, Serue hym in truth your hartes him beare For who hym dredth in singlenes, Can feele no want in baronnes, No hurt no harme nor other ill. Geue thankes I will. 10 The Lyons lacke in hunger fret, The ryche I meane and gluttons vayne, To seke theyr pray though they be set, No foode wyth rest can they obtayne, Who seekes the Lord shall misse no gayne, Of all mens neede he hath the skill. Geue thankes I wil. 11 I saylde full sure: the seas at length, Ye children come and heare the case, I wyll you teach Gods feare and strength, By that I scapte so doubtfull place, For God me kept in all my race. From all theyr hate which would me spill. Geue thankes I will. 12 Sweete lyfe is good, it makth men glad, Who loueth it well wyth all hys hart, He shall not neede to be adrad, From dayes eterne who would not start, Keepe ye hys tong from ouerthwart. And all good wordes let hym fulfill. Geue thankes I wyll. 13 Fast truthfull worde confoundth all blame, Inure thy tong in truth to lose, Truth may be shent yet feare no shame. Forbeare all wordes opprobrious All craft, all curse most odious, For God of myght wyll strength thee still. Geue thankes I will. 14 Flee euill, do good, and haue good rest, Olde Adam kill thou formerlie, So Adam newe wyll follow best, Then seeke thou peace most busilie, But it ensue most earnestly, For peace from God doth full distill. Geue thankes I wyll. 15 God seeth the iust in prouidence, Hys eyes them marke in tendernes, He them relieueth in indigens, Hys eares he bendes in redines, When they do pray in carefulnes, He heares theyr voyce that worke none ill. Geue thankes I wyll. 16 God hateth the proude and them beshenth, With irefull face to daunt theyr brayne Hys vysage grim on them is bent Theyr gay renowne he wyll distayne Whych aye to lyue they would so fayne. Where they reiect all truth and skill. Geue thankes I wyll. 17 The iust opprest to God they cryed, He heard them soone in tyme and place In stresse and neede he them espyed, Wyth all defence he them dyd brace, To make them safe he hyed hys pace For ryghtfull men no spyte can spyll. Geue thankes I wyll. 18 God loueth the meeke: theyr ghostes be sweete To them soft sprites he doth impart Wyth faythfull teares who here doth greete He wyll them ease of all theyr smarte, To scape their foes, theyr spytefull arte Who would theyr wrecke on them fulfill. Geue thankes I will. 19 The iust felt payne: they yet indurde, In woes though wrapt all dolorous, Great gayne to them is death assured, God them so stayeth most meruelous, They ioye in lyfe most troubelous, The rage therof to quenche and still. Geue thankes I wyll. 20 The iust be strong: they neuer quayle, Theyr bones in strength kept totallie, Theyr constant hartes can neuer fayle, Theyr heyres be numbred seuerallie No bone to breake can possiblie, Such helpe from God doth most distill. Geue thankes I wyll. 21 The euill, dyeth euyll to death full loth, To late he spyeth hys wyckednes He must feare death that hated troth, He must for sweete feele bitternes, He harmde the iust, he sinnd no lesse, As euill he lyued, so dyeth he ill. Geue thankes I wyll. 22 Thanke thou the Lord who keepes thee still, All helpe from hym doth ay distill, Poore soules he ridde, from bondage ill Of wo and thrall none shall haue skill Whych trust in hym nought shall them spill, O then hys prayse looke ye fulfill. Geue thankes I wyll. Psalme. XXXV. The Argument. Christ prayth (in this) for recompence his foes to reape (agayne) theyr part: So man for wrong done hym agens, doth yet no spite in (hatefull) hart. Iudica Domine. 1 Plead thou O Lord my (ryghtfull) case O iudge (thy selfe) my hurtfull foes: Oppugne thou them in (open) face, which me (all day) impugne to lose. 2 Lay hand (O Lord) vpon the sworde, and eke (take so) the buckler to: Stand vp (to helpe) in thy good worde, to keepe from me my (wrathfull) fo. 3 Bryng (forth the) speare and stop the way, of them (so fierce) which me would harme: To my poore soule (good Lord) oh say, I am thy health and (stable) arme. 4 Let them be (driuen and) put to shame, that seeke (by craft) my soule to spill: Put them (abacke) to shamefull name, that me wyth griefe would (deadly) fill. 5 Make them (to bee) as dust we see, before the wynde so (lightly) blowne: (In hast) let Gods swift aungel nie, them (dryue in) chase wyth power knowne. 6 Make way (to them) all slippery, let it to them be (blynd and) darke: Gods aungel (so mought) dryue them by, to feele thy myght and (handy) warke. 7 For they close net (and snare) haue layd, euen causeles me to (kil and) stroy: Yea causles (sure euen) as I sayd my soule in pit (and graue) to cloy. 8 Let (sodayne) wo take hym vnware, hys (crafty) net hymselfe to trap: Let mischiefe fall wyth (payne and) care (ryght soone) into hys onely lap. 9 My soule (I say) I bid thee leape, wyth ioye (all glad) in thys thy Lord: It shall (no doubt) hys health so reape, that ioy he shall (alway) recorde. 10 My bones (so broosde) shall say O Lord, who may (in strength) to thee be lyke? Which sauest the poore from (tyrantes) sworde from (irefull) spoylyng hym to keepe. 11 False witnes soone (at me) dyd ryse, in wyckednes most (hasty) whote: Of me they spurde (of thynges) full nyse, that I knew not (at all) God wot. 12 They dyd (vnkynd) reward me euill, for good to them I (frendly) wrought: To greue my soule (it was) theyr wyll, to bryng my lyfe (and dayes) to nought. 13 But yet (I say) when they were sicke, in sacke cloth then I (wept and) mournd, My soule (wyth fast) I humbled meke, my prayer to me (eftsoones) retournd. 14 I wept (and waylde) as dearest frende, as (any) brother that they had: As childe for mother (doth by) kynde, in blacke (aray) I was all clad. 15 But they (agayne) in my great euill, they floct (on heapes) and dyd reioyce: Most abiectes (cam and) mockt me still, (and I) not ware in spitefull noyce. 16 Wyth such lewd slaues (so vyle) to see, to them were scorners (ioyntly) knit: Theyr teeth they gnast (and grynd) on mee as (peysant) mockers was be fit. 17 When wylt thou set (O Lord) thy sight, on thys my payne I (dayly) beare? (O Lord) ryd me from all theyr spite, from Lyons whelpes (defend) my deare. 18 My thankes (therfore) I will extend, when folke (in place) be met so most: In companies (as due) to sende, all prayse (to thee) in euery cost. 19 Let not my foes (in ire) at me, reioyce in quarell (falsly) styll: For (gyltles) they hate me to free, wyth (wynkyng) eyes they mocke theyr fill. 20 For why no peace (in truth) they speake, but all (do rage) agaynst the meke: Good men on earth (they wyshe) to wreke, for thys in craft (and guile) they seeke. 21 Theyr face (and mouth) they haue distort, at me (they cry) wyth fie and fie: Our eye hath seene (they say) a sport, that we (wyth ryght) may hym defie. 22 O Lord (my God) this hast thou seene, be not at this to (dumme and) still: In thee (thou knowst) my trust hath beene, depart not far (from me) in will. 23 Ryse vp and wake (in hast) I say, to iudge my cause in (open) syght: My Lord and God (thou canst) them fray aduenge (thou soone) my quarell ryght. 24 Oh iudge (my cause) as thou art wont, in (equall) iustice Lord of thyne: O (Lord my) God least in this bront, my foes reioyce (to much) in fyne. 25 Refrayne (in tonge) them thus to say, there there, we see (for vs) inough: Let them not say (O Lord) I pray, we haue hym (surely) swalowd now. 26 Let them feele shame (and blame) at full, which ioye (and laugh) at my distresse: At me who brag (and boast) that wull, let shame and spyte them (fully) presse. 27 Let them (euen so) in ioy be glad, that wyshe (to see) my ryght redrest: To God (for aye) let thankes be had, who wylth (so kynd) hys seruants rest. 28 My tonge (then thus) shall lowd rebound, thy prayse (O Lord) and iustice eke: All day I will in (perfect) sound, thy laude tell (iust euen) weeke by weeke. Psalme. XXXVI. The Argument. Here wycked mens delite, Is paynted, what it is: But blyndenes deepe in (open) sight, In vertue whole remisse. Dixit iniustus. 1 In mydst of euill mans hart, Hys sinne hath blynd hym so: Gods feare (all whole) is set a part, From both hys eyes ago. 2 For he himselfe doth glose, In hys bewitched eyes: Tyll God his sinne (so foule) disclose Most worthy hate to ryse. 3 Hys wordes of mouth be nought, And kepes much guile in store: To cease he biddeth hys (hart and) thought, To worke by vertues lore. 4 Shrewd turnes in irefull mood, He most in bed doth muse: He hold on wayes not (truely) good, No euill deede he refuseth. 5 Thy mercy Lord in heauen, Yet ouer all doth spread: Thy faythfull truth is (daily) seene, The cloudes to reache in bread. 6 Thy iustice Lord we see, As mountaynes ferme to rest: Thy iudgements (hye O) secret bee, Thou shalt saue man and beast. 7 How worthy Lord most iust, Excelth thy grace benigne? As Adams flocke shall (firmely) trust, In fence of thy good wynge. 8 Of thy fat houshold store, As drunken shall they bee: And drinke (at neede) them shalt thou poure, Of pleasures welles most free. 9 For thou hast well of lyfe, With thee all health aboundth: And Lord in thy bryght lyght so ryfe, Of vs shall lyght be found. 10 O draw thy mercy neare, To them which loue thee then: And let thy grace (O Lord appeare, To rightfull harted men. 11 And let no foote of pryde, Approche me hawtely: Nor wicked hand (in hate) beside, To moue me wretchedly. 12 These workers vayne of euill, In theyr owne turne be cast: Repulse they haue in (croked) will. From footyng be they past. Psalme. XXXVI. The Argument. This psalm aforesaid in an other Metre. Here haue ye paynted beforne your eyes tweyne The restles witte of the fell wycked wyght, How he careth and carkth for his lytheir gayne, How he flotth aloft in hye power and myght, And setth God and his hallowes all in despyte, Whose cursed steps the iust makth his orison, In lyfe not to tread to hys confusion. Dixit iniustus. 1 Musing vpon the variable busines, That thys troubly world haunth by sea &amp; lande My hart geueth me that sinne and wyckednes, Suggestth to the wycked that he may stand. Wythout any feare safely of Gods hand, For no feare of hym is in all hys sight, Of Gods law he is bereaued the shyning lyght. 2 Me fel to mynd that he wonted thus to go, To flatter aye hymselfe in his own sight, For sinne the venom did enchaunt hym so, That in it he hase his whole delyte, And thynkth in hart that all is aright, But God will spye out his sinne abominable, Though to the world it hath visour commendable. 3 Busily in mynd I gan to reuolue, His words vnrighteous and craftely layd, All truth and Iustice of God to dissolue But mere deceit in hipocrisye wayghed And would not be controld of that he sayd, To learne of any man he did disdayne, How the very right way he mought attayne. 4 I noted eke so by night what he thought, When Gods men vsen: to recount their trespas But his head in his bed all mischiefe sought Imagening all goodnes to deface, To banyshe all truth and that to disgrace, In no godly way set was his busy brayne, For all wicked wayes he toke for hys gayne. 5 The wicked thus heaping his sinne on hye Where by desert he might be forsake: How meruelous O Lord is than thy mercy, That from this world thy care thou dost not take, Hye vp to heauen and clouds his course doth it make, All men to feede both good and eke the bad, Such faythfulnes euer thy promyse haue had. 6 Thy prouidence O God most meruelous, To all men mortall is inscrutable, More stable and hye then mountaynes hideous More deepe then sea botomles, vnsearcheable Be thy secret iudgements insuperable, For not man only of thy power doth tast, But brute beasts of thee also hath their repast. 7 Man might muse much O God this to exp?d But what earthly man could this matter tell, How thou by thy hand doost all things defend, In what bounty thy mercy doth excell, How profound eke thou art in thy counsell, Well Adams childern may well in thee trust, Under thy good wings to be shadowed iust. 8 Who wil thy blessed word trust in faith sure, They shalbe filled with all plenteousnes, For thy store house is full of all pleasure For thou geuest them to tast of thy sprits goodnes, Whose swete welles they shall drynke by thy larges, From whose bellyes shall lyuely water spring, Others to refreshe to thy gloryfyeng. 9 For with the only be these welles of lyfe, Of frayle men spring but podels of myre, From whom sourdeth errour &amp; croked strife, In the only is that we can require, Both lyght truth and lyfe to fill our desire, For in thy lyght truely, lyght must we see, Or els in all darkenes wrapt shall we dee. 10 Thy gentle goodnes O Lord impart, To such as faythfully thy word do kepe, Who know thee both wyse &amp; merciful in hart, That from day to day they may thy face seke, For they to thee beare aright their hartes meke Thy rightousnes they know &amp; thy iudgements Thy holy worde &amp; eke thy commaundementes. 11 Since than the meke of hart be so at ease, And proude be out of fauour all exilde: Kepe me O Lord from pride their foule disease For they haue both thee and thy worde reuylde Let not my foote be in theyr steps begylde, Kepe away from my soule their violence, That they lay no hand vpon my pacience. 12 Thus depe musing with my selfe in a trance Callyng to mynde the endes of good and bad: Though they tweine here lead a life in distance How the bad for hys myrth shall once be sad, And the good for theyr woe shall once be glad, How the nought shal be cast on the worse hand then deemd I in fine, that truth shal sure stand. Psalme. XXXVI. The Argument. This psalm of an other kynde of Metre. Here playne do ye see: how the earthly man, All sinne do commit in his hart that he can, No loue can him moue: of the Lord for to see, No feare can him stay: from hys errour to flee. Dixit iniustus. 1 The wycked in hart: as I gesse is he bent, All sinfull abuse: in hys lyfe to frequent: Of God hath he not: any feare in hys eyes, So wilfull he goes: in hys awkly deuyse. 2 For blyndly he vseth: for to flatter himselfe, So pride hath hym puft: by his waltering wealth: Untyll that his sinne: so behated of God, Found out by his search: be dewrayed by his rod. 3 The wordes of hys mouth: be vnrightfully wayed, In sleyghty deceyt: be they craftely layed: Quyte ceased he hath: to behaue hym aryght, Good deed for to do: hath he driuen from hys syght. 4 All mischiefe he dreames: to deuise in his bed, From godly desertes: hath he turned hys hed: No way that is good: hath he cleaued vnto, No euill can he hate: but in it doth he go. 5 Thy mercy O Lord: to the heauen doth ascend, Styll hym to abide: so to make hym amend: Thy faythfulnes eke: to the cloudes doth amount, Though graceles he be: not hys lyfe to recount. 6 Thy righteousnes standeth: like the mountayns on hye Most stable it is: how so vaynly he lye: Thy Iustice in domes: to the deepes be they lyke, Frayle man with the beast: with thy helth for to seeke. 7 How wondrous O God: is thy pityfull hart, Thus man to relieue: in hys lyfe ouerthwart: More suerly trust: may the chyldren of men, Thy wynges shall them keepe: as her birdes doth y? hen 8 Full fed shall they be: by thy plenteous store, Thy grace is so large: to thy prayse euermore: Sweete drinke shall they haue: by thy deinty repast, As floudes do we see: fro the sprynges to be cast. 9 For truly with thee: is the fountayne of lyfe, All vertue in whom: may we spye to be rife: No doubt in thy light: shall we light euer see, And blynd shall we be: if we vary fro thee. 10 Continue to them: O thy fatherly grace, Who knowe thy renome: who thy bounty embrace: To them (do we craue): so thy iustice impart, Who serue thee aright: in a purified hart. 11 One bone for my selfe: do I hartely pray, No foote of the proud: that against me he laye: And let not the hand: of the wickedly wight, Confound me by sleight: so to vanguyshe my might. 12 Euen there are they fallen: in their crafty deuise, These workers of euyll: be they neuer so nyse, And cast be they downe: by thy powerfull hand, Not able to ryse: neuer able to stand. Psalme. XXXVII. The Argument. Here taught we be That we deny our selfe (in hart) to hang of God, How good shall well And euill shall euill at last (in state) haue their abode Noli emulari. 1 Ensue thou not: men obstinate, Ne fret (in hart) ne stryue wyth them: Enuy thou nat: theyr wycked state, A tyme (but short) to row the streme. 2 For soone as hay: they shall away, as (witherd) grasse cut downe I say: So swiftly fade: as herbe the blade, how greene (and fresh) so euer it lay. 3 Trust thou the Lord: hold fast hys worde, be doyng still good (righteous) deede: Dwell thou in land: hold still thy hand, in truth (and rest) thy fayth to feede. 4 Thus thy delyte: shall God be ryght, to hym than set thyne (eare and) hart: What mynde can craue: or wyshe to haue, God wyll it iust (ryght soone) impart. 5 Commit thy way: thy state and stay, to Gods (most strong) all louyng grace: Trust hym in fayth: for what he sayth, he bringth it well to (redy) passe. 6 He will expresse: thy ryghteousnes, at length (of tyme) as sunne so bryght: And will endue: thy iudgement true, wyth lyght as noone (doth shyne) in sight. 7 Be still in God: abyde hys rod, let hym (alway) do what he wyll: Fret not I reede: though wycked speede, who sueth (so fast) all counsayles euill. 8 Recede from ire: no tyme conspire, wyth them (to go) thy heate refrayne: Els shall thy will: be moued still, to counterfet theyr (wycked) brayne. 9 Maligners all: shall haue a fall, They shall be (all deepe) rooted out: Where who abyde: the Lord theyr guide, shall vse (at wyll) the lande no dout. 10 Wythin a whyle: all wycked wyle, shall passe (away) and melt to nought: Hys place wheras: late greene he was, shall not be found though (Nylo) sought. 11 But yet the meeke: shall as they lyke, enherite sure: the (stable) earth: God wyll theyr stresse: In heauen refreshe, wyth store (and choyce) of peaceful myrth. 12 Th'ungodly seeke: agaynst the meeke, his counsayles mad to (weaue and) warpe: He gnasht hys teeth: yf nought he seeth, in lyfe of them (in shame) to carpe. 13 The Lord shall let: hys wrath and threat, and laugh at hym (full dry) in scorne: For he doth see: hys day to bee, at hand to wayle (full sore) forlorne. 14 Theyr sword drawne out: bow bent so stout, the wycked (sort all) redy hath: To bryng the poore: to death hys dore, to kill the iust in (hatefull) wrath. 15 Theyr sword so fierce: theyr hartes shal pierce themselfe agayne (so iust) to quyte: Theyr bow so bent: shall be but rent, and voyde shall be theyr (irefull) myght. 16 A little store: got iust before, to ryghteous man is (alway) more: Than is the food: and all the good, of (suttle) man that crafth therfore. 17 The armes and sleyghtes: wyth all the baytes of wycked man shall (shortly) quayle: Yet wyll the Lord: the iust aforde, theyr holde (and trust) shall neuer fayle. 18 God knowth the dayes: and loueth the wayes of godly men (theyr lyues) to ayde: From tycle chaunce: theyr heritaunce, shall last (in tyme) for euer stayde. 19 In perilous dayes: of dreadfull frayes, they shall not stand (in feare) amasde: In tyme of dearth: of barren earth, theyr (store and) plenty shall be blasde. 20 But wycked men: shall peryshe then, gods foes though (they be) hye aloft, Yet lyke the sunne: shall they consume, as (meltyng) fat of lambes so soft. 21 The wycked man: he borow can, but wyll not pay (hys det) agayne: The ryghteous man: to lend he can, and feelth therin no (bitter) payne. 22 Gods blessed men: deepe rooted then, shall raygne (at will) and haue their fyll: Gods cursed men: vp rooted then, shall sterue (for lacke) and want theyr wyll. 23 The Lord is guyde: at good mans syde, hys kynde of lyfe (he so) alowth: Hys steps and gate: hys lyfe hys state, God guideth (full sure) and it auowth. 24 If chaunce he slippe: by humayne tryp, yet (fully) flat he falth not down: Gods hand hym stayth: and vnder layth, to keepe hym (iust both) safe and sound. 25 I yong haue bene: now olde am sene, the iust (as yet) I neuer knew: Once destitute: or yet hys fruite, to seke theyr bread (in nede) vndue. 26 The iust man wull: be mercifull, still lendth (hys good) he hourdth not than: And yet hys seede: in grace shall speede, both blest (and praysd) of God and man. 27 Flee thou all euill: wyth hart and wyll, do good that God (of thee) requyrth: Than trust thou sure: long tyme t'endure, to haue (all thyng) what hart desierth. 28 For God loueth ryght: and wyll not quyte, geue vp hys sayntes (for aye) to wayle: Hys deare elect: be euer kept, where wycked seede shall (fowly) quayle. 29 The ryghteous man: most stable than, the earth (at rest) inherite shall: Therin to dwell: most safely well, for euer (sure and) not to fall. 30 The ryghteous mouth: is traynd in south, in wisdom (godly) all inured: Hys tonge wyll talke: all wysdomes walke, in sentence ryght (alway) assured. 31 For why Gods law: is all hys awe, and shet in hart: (it is full fast: Hys lyfe and gate: as stable state, shall neuer slyde (once made) agast. 32 The wycked prye: they toote to spye, the walke (and trade) of ryghteous man: They search and seeke: some cause to pyke, to kill hym (quyte and) if they can. 33 But God hys strength: wyll not at length, leaue them in theyr foule (suttle) handes: To be condemnd: by foes so fremde, at sentence (nye so) when he standes. 34 Trust thou the Lord: keepe fast hys worde, for he wyll thee on hye promoote: To holde the land: where wycked band, at eye (ryght downe) shall fall in foote. 35 For I euen I: haue spyed wyth eye, the wycked (wyght O) far a loft: So strong to see: as Ceder tree, so grene (and freshe) as bay full oft. 36 Tho went I by: hys seate to spy, but lo (full soone) it was agone: I sought hys place: to see hys grace, fye (stable) place then had he none. 37 Thys is the summe: soone good become, in cliffe (alway) be innocent: Hold truth full fast: for truth at last, bringth (ioyfull) peace with gods assent. 38 But wretched men: who wicked ren. by heapes shall fall in (shamefull) feare: Their fortune falth: their pleasure palth, their ende (of dayes) is woofull chere. 39 Where helth and welth: from God himselfe. to righteous men so (fastly) growth: He is theyr shield: theyr strength in field, when trouble (chance or) ouerflowth. 40 God them shall fence: and ryd them thence, where (proudly) rule all wycked men: He wyll them saue: for why they haue, theyr trust (and hope) in hym agayne. Psalme. XXXVIII. The Argument. Meeke Dauid prayde: and ceased nat, In wo dismayde: nye dead in that, Yet so arayde: he faltred nat, In God he stayde: he altered nat, No further strayde: he varied nat, But thus he sayde: he taried nat. Domine ne in furore. 1 O Lord to sore: correct me not, In angers store: oh checkt me not, For sinne the sore: abiect me not, O Lord abiect me not. 2 Thy irefull dartes: be asperous, They pricke my hart: most dolorous, Thy hand so smart: is burdenous. Reiect me not. 3 There is no helth: in all my flesh, Thy wrath my wealth: doth so represse, My bones themselfe: for sinne want peace. Abuse me not. 4 My sinnes my heede: haue ouerflown, As heauy lead: they be so grown, Theyr fearefull dread: haue down me thrown Refuse me not. 5 My woundes do ren: and sore they stinke, Alasse the dynne: them when I thinke, My folish sinne: I do forethinke. Despise me not. 6 In far great wo: lowe am I brought, My trespace so: my payn hath wrought, Al day I go in mournyng thought. Repryse me not. 7 My loynes are fyld: with sore disease, My fleshe is spyld: and haue none ease: Al parts be styld none haue release. Suppresse me not 8 Full weake I lye: deiect in stresse, I roard on hye: In carefulnes, My hart ye spye: remedylesse. Oppresse me not. 9 O Lord thou spiest: what would I fayne, And thou aduisest: my gronyng payne, Yet me denyest: to helpe agayne. Represse me not 10 My hart doth pant: ah wofull wight, My strength is scant: and all my might, Myne eyes do want: their sence and light. Bewound me not. 11 My louyng frendes: from me they flee, Wyth careles myndes: my griefes they see, My kinne them wyndes: full far fro me. Confound me not. 12 My foes which sought: my lyfe to spill, Close snares they wrought: to catch me euil, They talkt of nought: to trap me still. Beshame me not. 13 I yet kept me: as deafe I were, As dumme to see: in tong and eare, Theyr scornes at eye: I dyd them beare. Defame me not. 14 As one I say: wythout an eare, My mouth all day: I dyd not stere: No checkes I lay: to all thys geare. Deface me not. 15 For Lord in thee: I had my trust, My God most free: thou art so iust, And thou for mee: still aunswer must. Disgrace me not. 16 As thee my guide: I prayd in voyce, That they to wyde: should not reioyce, To see me slide: to fall in choyce. Abase me not. 17 For sinnefull det: such plages to beare, In dolour great: it made me feare, My hart is fret: to feele them neare. Detrude me not. 18 I wyll confesse: my wyckednes, My sinnes excesse: in heauines, O Lord my stresse: the more redresse. Exclude me not. 19 My foes be strong: they lyue at ease, They hate me wrong: they do not cease, By heapes in throng: on me they prease. Detect me not. 20 Who dyd requyte: my good wyth euill, They dyd me spyte: they would me spill, For that the ryght I did fulfill. Deiect me not. 21 Thou seest my state: forsake me not, To theyr great hate: betake me not, Lord God to late: awake thou not. Forsake me not. 22 My Lord of wealth: oh tary not, From thee thy selfe: oh vary not, That I in health: miscary not, My Lord my God: O tary not. Oh tary not. Psalme. XXXIX. The Argument. [illeg.]usto[illeg.] Whan Dauid sawe the world so bad: Gods men for truth to scorne, To God in hart complaynt he had: his tonge in silence borne. 1 I full decreed my wayes to wayte: least I in tong myght erre, To stop my mouth with mosell strayt: nye me while sinners were. 2 By silence long, euen dom I was: from truth I helde my peace: It fret me sore good thinges to passe: my griefes so dyd not cease. 3 My hart within was set on heate: thus musing fire it tooke: My tong brake out, some thyng to treate: then silence I forsooke. 4 Tell me myne ende O Lord I sayd: what number haue my dayes: That I may know how long dismayd: I here shall lyue in frayes. 5 My dayes lo thou at fyngers hast: a span in brede they bee, My life to thee as nought is cast: lyues man whole vanitie. 6 In shadow darke mans walke is set: in broyle he toyleth in vayne: He heapth and heapth and knowth not yet: who reape shall all hys payne 7 Now th? O Lord what loke I for? while men thus earth do wrote My hope no dout thou art in store: thou art my health and bote. 8 To scape thy rod deliuer me: from myne offences quite: And make me not a scorne to be: to men of folishe spite. 9 Lord dom I layd in patience: not once my mouth to ope: For this thou dydst by prouidence: to proue my fayth and hope. 10 Remoue thy scourge from me to flye: by sinne I know deserued, Thy hand so smart hath spent me nye: be I yet (Lord) preserued. 11 For when for sinne thou scourgest man: by plages down sent fro the As cloth by mothe, hys soule doth wan: all men then britle be. 12 Heare Lord my sute, and harke my cry: not deafely heare my teares For Pilgrim strange with thee I lye: as were my fathers yeares. 13 O spare me then, that I my strength: recouer may therfore: Before I go from hence at length: and after seene no more. Psalme. XXXIX. The Argument. King Dauid prayed as dumme to go, before his cruell fo, To scape from his wo: of sinne to be quyte, And sayth that man is vanitie right Euen mere vayne vanitie light Uayne vanitie light. This psalm aforesaid in an other Metre. 1 I haue decreed: to wayte my wayes, lest tong should faute by strayes: My mouth will I kepe: with bridle to tye, While that I know my foe to be bye. While he in vanitie lygheth, In vanitie lygheth. 2 I held my tong, I nothyng sayd, In silence domme I layde, So lothe to reply: although to my payne, Great griefe I felt: good worde to restrayne, In world such vanitie raignth, Such vanitie raignth. 3 But musing thus: I was in heat, My hart did sore me freat: For fire the payne: prouoked me much, At last I spake: wyth murmuryng grutch, I saw the vanitie such, The vanitie such. 4 Lord let me know: myne ende of dayes, the number how it layes: So truely to touche, the certeintie yet, How long shall nature respite her det, To wayle my vanitie great, My vanitie great. 5 As span thou metst: the dayes of myne, And nought they be to thyne: In breuitie set, all wrapped in feare, God hap so far: great magre so neare, Man is but vanitie here, But vanitie here. 6 In shadow darke: man toylth wyth payne, and vexth himselfe in vayne: So gather he deare: goods carefully kept, He knowth not yet, by whome to be rept, So deepe in vanitie slept, In vanitie stept. 7 And now O Lord what is my hope, where men thus blyndly grope: Thou truly my scope: art onely to see, For man we know but shadow to bee, Whole set in vanitie he, In vanitie he. 8 O ryd me Lord that am so thrall, from myne offences all: That neuer I fall: as mocke and a scorne, Of wycked men: wyth teeth to be torne, Who be in vanitie borne. In vanitie borne. 9 And domme I went in all my payne, In mouth I dyd not playne: I mynded agayne thy doyng among, Thou wylt the iust to suffer a wrong, Of man in vanitie strong, In vanitie strong. 10 This plage for sinne yet take away, O Lord to thee I pray: For wasted I lay: thy hand is so fell, Thy terrours great: my conscience swell. I feele my vanitie well, My vanitie well. 11 When thy rebukes: mans sinne correcth, Hys strength is soone deiect: Hys beauty so checkt: thou bringst it a sleepe, As mothe in clothe: when slily they creepe, Eche man is vanitie deepe, Is vanitie deepe. 12 Expende my cry: bowe downe thyne eare, O Lord my prayer heare: My teares be thou neare: for straunger I am, And ghest wyth thee: my fathers the same, And they by vanitie lame, By vanitie lame. 13 O spare a tyme: and cease my payne, my strength to wynne agayne: Before to refrayne: eare death doth me spy, Consumde by thee: wyth irefull eye, Lest I in vanitie dye, In vanitie dye. Psalme. XL. The Argument. As Dauid prayed: so Christ may ye see, Himselfe to geue: full ready to bee, To God wyth thankes: most hartely free, And so they spied: theyr foes for to flee. They mist not to see. Expectans expectaui. 1 By silent watch: I wayted in sprite, The Lord of heauen: and stayd on his myght, At last he bowde: to shewe me hys sight, And heard my cry: that I dyd endight. Hys eare was so ryght. 2 He brought me forth: of horrible pit, In lome and clay: depe myerd in it: On stable rocke: he made me to sit, He lodes man was: and guyded my feete. In iourney so fit. 3 A song full new: he put in my mouth, To sing to God: hys laud for hys sooth: For he kynde thanke: most gently alowth, Of iust men eke: theyr hartes he auowth. So frendly he bowth. 4 Myne acte shal cause: full many to see, How God is good: most bountie and free, In feare to hym: in hart to agree, In hym to trust: all errour to flee. God lauded to bee. 5 Who trustth in God: is blessed in hart, Though wo hym vexth: how euer it smart: From God hys Lord: yet will not astart, To proude men such: as fables impart. Wyth lyes ouerwhart. 6 My God and Lord: thy wonders be hye, None can thy thoughts: by reason espye: Thou bearst to vs: though I dyd apply, I could not tell: the number at eye. Them halfe to descrye. 7 No sacrifice: do worke the delyght, Meate offerings none: do please thee aryght: But eares vnshit: thou shopst vs by might, Whole offeryngs brent: so sinne for to quyte. Thou longst not the sight. 8 Then sayd I strayt: most duely to thys, Lo here I come: not slowly remisse: In volume booke: there written it is, Of me in chiefe: wythout any mis. Thy name for to blisse. 9 Thy wyll to do: all whole am I bent, My God most hye: wyth gentle assent: To thy swete law: my hart doth relent, Wherby I trust: no tyme to repent. My choyce to lament. 10 Thy iustice great: my selfe shall I strayne, To thy great church: to tell it agayne: No tyme my lippes: from it will I frayne, And that thou knowest: most certainly playne Thy loue to retayne. 11 Thy ryghteousnes: I hid not in hart, Thy truth and health: I glad dyd impart: I kept not close: how louely thou wart, Thy fayth to folke: I spred it in part. So trusty thou art. 12 To me alway: thy mercy reserue, That I may thee: most faythfully serue: Let thy sweete grace: me daily preserue, Thy healthfull truth: that I may deserue. So neuer to swerue. 13 I am beset: wyth troublous woes, My sinnes so fell: do threat me to lose, As heares of head: in number they rose, My hart is faynt: it selfe to repose. So faintly it goes. 14 O Lord assent: to sende me thyne ayde, To ryd my foes that make me afrayde: Make hast to helpe: before I be layde, I dye if helpe: to me be denayde. As wholy decayde. 15 Who seeke in hate: my soule for to kill, Let shame them take: so cursed in will: Confound them all: which seeke me to spill, Let them fall backe: that wishe me so euill. That I may be still. 16 Wo worth them all: which me do defye, And shame for mede, that they myght aspye: Agaynst me who: so daily replye, And in my payne: say fye to the fye. Where health myght they cry. 17 Let these in thee: be ioyfully glad, Which seeke thy name: which be not adrad, To loue thy health: no tyme be they sad, That (God be praysde) by them may be sayd. For mercy so had. 18 Though poore I go: and needy I bee, The Lord so good: yet careth for mee: Thou art myne ayde: my suertie free, To tract thy tyme: Lord neuer agree. From me for to flee. Psalme. XLI. The Argument. Ye see how Christ makth here hys mone, Agaynst the Iewes to speake: So may the iust when he do grone, Gods cause not hys bewreake. Beatus qui intelligit. 1 That man is blest: that counth in hart, the poore (afflict) and nedies payne: For he in day: of bitter smart, hym God (hys Lord) wyll ease agayne. 2 God wyll hym kepe: and saue hys lyfe, and blesse (wyth wealth) in earth hys state: And ryd hys soule: from harme and stryfe, of all hys foes: in (deadly) hate. 3 The Lord will ease: whan he on bed, al wrapt (in payne) lyth sicke full oft: And comfort send his paynfull hed, thou tournst (O Lord) his couch full soft. 4 In payne I tournd: and sayd to thee, Haue mercy Lord (right sone) on me: Heale thou my soule: and make it free, For I (full oft) haue sinned to thee. 5 Mine enmyes thus: sayd wrathfully, their (angry) harts: so sweld in spite: Why doth he lyue: when shall he dye? his name (and fame) to perishe quyte. 6 And if they came: to visite me, they glosde (in craft) as they were vayne: Theyr hartes to guile: do full agree, and out (from thence) spake lyes agayne. 7 My foes in one: close rounded they, agaynst me whole: they (ioyntly) met: Euen me wyth lyes: they did I say, vnworthely (wyth guile) beset. 8 They sayd he wrought: some euyll deuise, that God him thus (so sore) doth strike: To life no more: God let him rise, that now (in bed) he lyeth so sicke. 9 Yea euen my frendes: familiar, at me (in scorne) they lyft theyr heeles: Euen they that farde: as I dyd fare, yet me (to trap) they markt at meales. 10 To mercy yet: Lord condescende, to me so poore: (in hart) I call: Rayse me agayne: that I may mende, I shall (therfore) rewarde them all. 11 By this I know: thy loue to me, for that (O Lord) myne enmies all: From triumphes yet: full far to be, to see (at eye) my house to fall. 12 For thou respectes: myne innocence, wherin thou didst: me (strongly) kepe: So shall thy grace: well strength me hence, (I trust) euen nye: thy face so meke. 13 O blessed be: of Israell, thys (mighty) God: and Lorde agayne: So be it aye: of men so well, wyth twise (at ende) Amen, Amen. Here beginneth the second booke of Psalmes. Psalme. XLII. The Argument. As Christ (the Lord) for hym and hys, In trust did pray: in (paynfull) stresse: So man euen like: as did his head, May iust the same: (in worde) expresse. Quemadmodum ceruus. 1 Euen lyke (in chase) the hunted Hynde, the water brookes: (doth glad) desire: Euen thus my soule: that faintie is, to thee (my God) would fayne aspire. 2 My (wery) soule: dyd thyrst to God, To God (the fount) of lyfe and grace: It sayd euen thus: when shall I come, To see (at eye) Gods liuely face. 3 My teares in stede: of (foode and) meate, Both day and nyght (to me) they were: Whyle that all day: rebukers sayd, Where is thy God: (fro thee) so far. 4 When this (O Lord) came soone to hart, I yet (therin) recomfort felt: And trust to lead: the people forth, to go (full glad) where thou hast dwelt. 5 To ioy in (hart: and) voyce of myrth, Wyth laudes &amp; thankes (most due) alway: Among thy folke: when that they kepe, So hye (in sight) theyr holy day. 9 Why castes thy selfe: than (flatly) downe, My (fainty) soule: I sayd no lesse: Why layest in me: so painfully, In (greuous) wo: and carefulnes? Put thou thy trust: (and hope) in God, Let (earthly) thyng: not thee amase: I wyll hym thanke: for all his helpe, In sight (most sure) of hys good grace. 6 My God my soule: is (dayly) vext, Wyth inward paynes (&amp; pangs) so thrill: I mynde thy workes: in Iordan yet, so done (by thee) next Hermon hill. 7 As deepe (profound) to deepe reboundth, at (dreadfull) noyce: of thy great showers Thy streames by course: so ouerflowes, My soule (alasse) the payne deuoures. 8 But God yet will: (commaund) the day, To shyne (most clere) me grace to see: My night of wo: shall prayse hym than, Who kept yet lyfe: (to byde) in mee. 9 Thou art my strength: (alone) O God I myght therby) than playne in wo: Why hast me thus: forgot so quyte, So sad to go: for (mortall) fo. 10 It pierceth my bones (as sharpe) as sword To heare my foes: in (cruell) spyte: They daily thus: at me vpbreyde, Where is (become) thy God of myght? 11 Why art thou then: (I say) my soule? So vext (wyth griefe) and prostrate so? Why makest in me: so much a do, Where God is frende: in (all thy) wo. 12 O put thy hope (I byd) in God, I trust (therto) in tyme and place: He is my God: whom I wyll thanke, My face shall see: hys (helpyng) grace. Psalme. XLIII. The Argument. For Saule hys wrong Prayd Dauid strong among Philistians The poore euen so To God in wo. may thus theyr cry auance. Iudica me Domine. 1 O God eterne: as iudge discerne my cause, from folkes vncleane: And ryd me so: from man that go, in vyce, and guyle doth meane. 2 My God of myght: thou art of ryght, Why hast vs dryuen from thee? Whyle thus go I: so mournfully, at mens hostilitie. 3 Send out thy lyght: and truth to sight, to leade and guyde my way: To see thy place: thy hyll of grace, where thou doost rest all day. 4 That I may go: Gods aulters to, to thee my God euen tyll: To thee my ioye: my God and roye, wyth harpe thee thanke I wyll. 5 My soule so dull: why art so full, of griefe and heauines? Why standst agast: as helpe were past? such thoughtes why doost impresse? Put all thy trust: in God most iust, I wyll hym thankes extende: He shewth me grace: euen nye at face, as God all health he sendth. Psalme. XLIII. The Argument. This psalm aforesaid in an other Metre. Poore Dauid prest by tyranny, Of wilfull Saule: who could not blin, For his blacke garde: to search hym nye, Prayth thus to God his helpe to winne, And wysheth that he his cause would try. He thus beginneth. Iudica me Deus. 1 Ah iudge me God: O iudge most true, Discern my cause: by power opprest Unfaintly men: do me pursue By lawes vniust: my right deprest, Which yet thy word: allowth full due, O geue me rest. Rule me to scape: that wycked man, 1. Reg. 24. That sinfull Saule: of shameles face, Who boasteth himselfe: all that he can, 2. Thes. 2. And doth vsurpe: thy godly place, Whose power by sleite: and sinne began. O iudge my case. 2 Know this I do: my God thou art To thee my strength: I whole appeale, Why putst me backe: why standst apart? My state to thee: I iust reueale, Why turnst from mee: thy louyng hart? O mercy deale. Eternall God: why go I thus, Ashamd in face: and vily checkt: My cause but made: opprobrious, Why doth my fo: thus me reiect? To beare me downe: so rigorous? O me respect. 3 Returne thy light: my hart to cheare, Perfourme thy fayth: that thou hast hight: Thy lyght and truth: let it appeare, To teache the blynde: thy worde so bryght, That it may rule: as law most deare, O kepe thy ryght. Make hast O Lord: and bring me nye, Thy holy hill: to sing thy prayse: Thy truth and lyght: of sanctuarie, Will be my guide: in all these frayes, Expell thys crosse, thys misery. O cheare my dayes. 4 That I may go: gods aulters to To offer thankes: in sacrifice: In hart deuout: as due is so, Yea nye in sight: to God to rise My God of ioy: ease thou my wo, O glad myne eyes. That thou alone: half geuen reliefe, I thee wyll laude: wyth harpe and lute: My God intiere: my helpe in chiefe, Thou shalt my foes: for me confute, So me to ayde: to ease my griefe, O heare my sute. 5 Why then my soule: art thou so sad? Why fretst within: why troublest me? So foule dismayd: in thoughts bestad, Knowst not that God: thy God is he? Call thys to mynde: to make thee glad, O make me free. Euen trust to God: in stablenes, No more but trust: for sure he is, I will hym yet: wyth laudes confesse, For he wyll cheare: my face iwis, My God my helth: he is no lesse. O graunt all this. Psalme. XLIIII. The Argument. This Psalme wyth God expostulath, That helpe he long delayes: It prayth for men all desolate, In olde respect of dayes. Deus auribus. 1 O God so good: before these dayes, we hard with open eares: The fathers sage: tolde vs thy wayes, thy workes of olde ferne yeares. 2 How thou expulst: the heathen rout, to plant thy people dere: What people stout: thou dydst wede out, to roote the fathers there. 3 Not they by sword: did winne the land, their owne arme saued them not. But thy bright face: thyne arme and hand, such loue at thee they got. 4 Thou art my kyng: O God my weale, none other sue I to: As once thou holpst good Israell, helpe Iacobs stocke euen so. 5 By thee our foes: down shall we throwe, our hornes shall burte them downe: In thy greate name: full well we know, to make our foes astowne. 6 For trust is none: in strength of bowe, that we can bende and draw: My sworde to weake: my strength to lowe, to helpe not worth a strawe. 7 But onely thou: euen onely thou, sauest vs from all our foes: Thou filst them all: wyth shame inough, at vs that hatefull goes. 8 Of God aboue: we make our boast, all day in thankefull part: To prayse hys name: in euery coast, for euer iust in hart. Sela 9 But what meanth this thou art so far, wherby our shame thou seest: Where thou wert wont to be so nar, our armies now thou fleest. 10 Thou makest vs fast to turne our backes, vpon our enemy: And who vs hate wyth spitefull crackes, they spoyle our goodes at eye. 11 Thou letst vs all: as sparpled sheepe, to be deuoured quyte: As scattred flocke: we mourne and weepe, among the Paynyms spyte. 12 To heathen dogs vncircumcised, thou selst thy flocke for nought: No gayne to thee: do ryse in deede, though we be solde and bought. 13 Thou makest vs all rebuke to take, of them that neygbours bee: Of vs but scorne: and scoffe they make, about vs whome we see. 14 Thou makst vs now: as laughyng stockes, a scorne vnto the heathen: They shake their heades: as we were blockes deryded vp to heauen. 15 My shame and eke: confusion, standth full to daunt myne eye: My face all shame: is put vpon, no ende therof I spye. 16 We heare to oft: the slaunderer, how he blasphemth our fayth: We see our fo: what hate he bearth, how he to vengeaunce layth. 17 Though yet these thinges be come on vs, we do not thee forget: Nor froward lyke: vngratious, thy couenaunt we reiect. 18 Our hart yet standth: not turnd aside, to seeke for other God: Nor yet our steps: begone so wyde, by wayes to walke so brode. 19 No though thou hast: vs smitten sore, where Dragons cruell dwell: Though paynde we be: and tost the more, wyth death the shadowes fell. 20 Among thy plages: if we so euill, should God in name forget: To holde our handes: in straying will, to other Gods beset? 21 Should not our God: inquyre for thys, to searche where we become? Who knowth our harts and doth not misse, the secretes all and some? 22 When thus for thee: all day we bee, as drawne to death and slayne: Appoynted thus: as sheepe we see, to slaughter driuen a mayne. 23 Then wake O Lord: why sleepst so deepe, as though thou louedst not ryght? Aryse, be nye: thy people keepe, aye leaue vs not to spyte. 24 Why turnst thy face: so irefully, we lowly sinners bee: Why doost forget: our misery, our troubles great to see. 25 Our soule to dust: is brought a downe, euen iust at deathes gate: Our bellies cleaues: in paynfull swowne, to ground in fearefull state. 26 Aryse O God: and helpe vs soone, deliuer vs so thrall: For thyne owne sake: we be vndone, for mercy we do call. Psalme. XLV. The Argument. A laude ye see: of king and queene, set out most glorious: But Christ and eke: his spouse is seene, more nye described thus. Eructauit cor meum 1 My hart breakth out: sweete prayse to syng, my song to kyng I make: My tonge as swift: to do the thyng, as scribe hys penne can shake. 2 More fayre thou art: more amorous than Adams sonnes I say: Thy spech of lippes: is gracious, for God blest thee for aye. 3 Begyrd thy thigh; Prince valiant, with sword to vanquish stout: To thy owne laude: as mete it stant, thy fame must shew it out. 4 In worship, speede: and prosper, hye, ryde on to fence the truth: In mekenes clad: and equitye, great acts thy hand ensueth. 5 Thyne arrowes kene: full sharply goes, all folke to thee shall fall: Among the mids: the kings his foes, their harts to vanquishe all. 6 Thy royall throne: O God is fast, which euer shall endure: Thy kingdoms mace: all right is cast, to iudge in truth full sure. 7 Thou louest the right: and hatst the wronge, O God, thy God therfore: With oyle of ioye: anoynts the stronge, beyonde thy match the more. 8 Thy garments smell: of Aloes, of Myrre and cassia: From Iuory chests: out brought they these, to glad thy hart I say. 9 Among thy maydes: so debonayre, kings daughters there were tolde: Thy right hande helde: the Queene so fayre, in colourd cloth of golde. 10 O daughter heare: and see full kynde, inclyne thyne eare to mee: Thy people whole: cast out of mynde, thy fathers house to flee. 11 So shall the kyng: thy bewty lyke, hys loue shall ioyne to thee: He is thy God: and Lord to seeke, wyth hart then serue hym free. 12 So Tyrus land: shal thee enriche, and they that richest standes: Shall bryng thee giftes: thy face to seache, wyth thee to ioyne theyr handes. 13 Thys kynges sweete Queene: is glorious, all whole wythin to see: Her garmentes wrought: all curious, wyth gold enbroydred bee. 14 So brought she is: before the kyng, in clothe of needle wrought: Her Uirgin maydes: her companieng, her frendes shall nye be brought. 15 Wyth ioye and myrth: they shall full nye, be brought to hym I say: In palace there: most innerly, where kyng hymselfe doth lay. 16 Thy fathers romes: such auncientes, thy sonnes shall iust succede: Whom thou mayst make: as Presidentes, all landes in rule to sprede. 17 Thy name to all: in memory, I euer wyll denounce: The people so: shall durably, to thee aye thankes pronounce. Psalme. XLVI. The Argument. In this Christes spouse elect (full well) Her thankes to God extendth: For that he dyd her foes debell, And that he her defendth. Deus noster refugium. 1 Our hope is God and strength (at eye) he guidth wyth hys good hand: A present helpe: in trouble nye, hys grace therby doth stand. 2 For this we neede: not care (and feare) though world be cast in stowne: Though hils to sea: were thrown (euen there) though all turne vpside downe. 3 The waters though: they rage (in streme) how euer they do swell: Though mountayns quake: at noyse of them, yet iust man hopth full wel. Sela 4 For why sweete brookes: and floudes (full nye) Gods Citie glad shall steepe: Hys holy place: and sanctuarye, God strongly it doth keepe. 5 God dwelth in myds: of her (alone) no man shall her remoue: Ryght early God: shall helpe her sone, hys church I meane aboue. 6 The heathen though: they rage (to fonde) and realmes resist I say: God raysde hys voyce: and so in londe, our foes dyd melt away. 7 The Lord of hostes: so strong (euen he) Wyth vs he standth to fyght: So Iacobs God: our refuge be, we feare no humayne myght. Sela. 8 Lo come and see: how God (in wrath) great meruayles aye hath wrought: What landes to nought: he scatred hath, how low theyr Idols brought. 9 He put down warrs: and stryfe (in feare) the whole world where they went: He knapth the bow: and breakth the speare, wyth fire he charets brent. 10 Be still and know: I say (all ye) that God I am aryght: To heathen all: knowne will I be, the world shall see my myght. 11 The Lord of hostes: so strong (from hence) wyth vs he is I say: And Iacobs God: is whole our fence, our boast in hym doth lay. Sela. Psalme. XLVII. The Argument. This Psalme to ioy exhorth: all christen men in sight: That Christ by power ascended so: whom glory sued aright. Omnes gentes. 1 Together clap ye handes: ye Gentils all be glad: Reioyce to God in melody: with thanks for mercy had 2 The Lord is hie in power: and ought be feard I say, He is the king of all the earth: to hym all thinges obey. 3 He shall so vnder vs: the people soone subdue: All Gentils cast at feete of vs: at vs their Lordes to sue. 4 He dyd chose out all vs: an heritage so fayre: Euen Iacobs hie magnificence: wh? he did loue as heyre. 5 God is ascended vp: in ioyfull noyse on hye: With trumpets noyse: as once his arke, eu? thus vp hie did stye, 6 O prayses sing to him: O prayses see ye sing: Sing prayses still vnto our god: and laud him iust as king 7 For that our God is king: of all the world so rounde: Sing ye his prayse than prudently: w? vnderst?ding sound 8 For God by strength doth raigne: vpon the heathen all God sitteth vpon his holy seate: all thyng doth heare hys call. 9 The peoples heds be met: with Abrahams god &amp; seede Of god they be to shield the earth: but god doth th? exceede Psalme. XLVIII. The Argument. Gods Citie here Is praysed clere a type of Christ hys spouse, It teachth agayne All Christen men of prayse to pay theyr vowes. Magnus Dominus. 1 Great is the Lord: wyth hye accorde, so praysed ought to bee: In citie great: where God is set, hys holy hill to see. 2 For Syon hyll: is fayer still, of all the world the blisse: This hyll so wyde: holdth North on syde, Gods citie hye it is. 3 Our God euen thus: most glorious, is knowne in palace great: As refuge sure: all men to cure, that place is hys so neat. 4 For lo the kynges: theyr gatherynges, in earth made her to spoyle: Though thus they met: wyth fury whet, yet her they could not foyle. 5 Her walles and holdes, they dyd behold, and merueld all agast: Theyr hartes were danke: theyr brags were blanke, eftsones they downe were cast. 6 Such feares and panges, theyr harts so wrang in tyme of theyr assaute: As women knowes: theyr bearyng throwes, wyth feares lyke were they fraught. 7 So dyd they quayle: as Tharsis sayle, felt wreckt by wyndes of East: For Paynyms all: be worthy fall, Gods heritage to wrest. 8 As we dyd heare: so saw we neare, Gods citye hye and strong: Thys God of oures: the God of powers, wyll strength her aye from wrong. Sela. 9 As we conceyud: so we receyud, O Lord thy mercy great: For we dyd wayte: thy helpe most great, in myds of temple set. 10 As (EL) thy name: is strong in fame, So is thy prayse well sene: The world full out, and so no dout, thy workes full ryghteous bene. 11 Let Syon mount: her ioy recount, let Iudas townes be glad: For thys thy dome: to pull a downe, these Paynyms frantike mad. 12 Walke ye about: the wals so stout, of Syons gostly house: And tell her towers: her fortes and bowers, her prayse that ye may rouse. 13 And marke ye well: how strong she dwelth, in bulwarkes how she lie. That ye may tell: it euery deale, to your posteritie. 14 This God euen hee: our God we see, for aye and euer strong: He shall vs guyde: tyll death so wyde, of hym shall be our song. Psalme. XLIX. The Argument. The Iewes be here, Reproued full nere, theyr honour not to see, It doth inuite The Christen knight, of worlde the pryde to flee. Audite omnes. 1 O heare ye out: ye gentiles stout, thys thyng that I wyll tell: But ponder it: wyth eares vnshit, thys world all ye that dwell. 2 Ye Adams broode: ye noble blood, heare ye my spell and lore: Both hye and low: all whole in row, the ryche and eke the poore. 3 My mouth shall splay: all wisdomes way, that will man kepe and saue: My hart doth muse: most godly truthes, all vnderstandyng graue. 4 I wyll incline: these eares of myne, to parable full meete: Deepe wordes in harpe: my mouth wil carpe, the sence though shall be sweete. 5 Why should I feare: euill dayes to beare, to set on mucke my hart? That euen my heele: of lyfe so euill, at last myght bryng me smart? 6 For some there bee: whose hartes agree, in goodes to put theyr trust: And boast themselues: as carkyng elues, of ryches store vniust. 7 No brother can: redeme a man, from death though fayne he would: Or God to go: to offer to, agreement who so should? 8 The pryce to great: herein is set, from death a soule to bye, That must he leaue: to gods owne leaue, for aye in hym to lye. 9 That is to say: that he should aye, byde here in mortall state: That he no graue: should euer haue, but lyue in pleasant rate. 10 For he may spy: that wyse men dye, and peryshe all the fort: As well the wyse: as mad and nyse, to others leaue theyr port. 11 And can they thynke: that neuer sinke, theyr houses shall and fames: That they here still: shall dwell theyr fill, and landes to beare theyr names? 12 It will not be: that euer he, shall last in glory gay: But forth must go: as beastes they do, in britle state and way. 13 Lo this theyr way: is folishe stray, they blunder blyndly thus: And yet theyr broode: prayse this for good, as fooles obliuious. Sela. 14 They shall lye deepe: in hell lyke sheepe, and death shall gnaw theyr mawe: But clere in lyght: of mornyng bryght, the iust shall be their awe. 15 Theyr beauty gay: shall wast away, in graue with stinche on sweete: Theyr houses clene: shal not be sene, for them so after meete. 16 But as for me: my God euen he, my soule he iust will saue: From hell the power: in blessed hower, my sprite to hym to haue. Sela. 17 But feare thou nat: ne deare thou that, though one be welthy made, Though now hys house, shyne glorious, in honours portly trade. 18 For nought he shall: of riches all, hence cary whan he dyth: Nor yet hys pryde: hys pompe so wyde, in graue wyth hym shall lye. 19 Whyle here he dwelt: hys soule he delt, all ease wyth pleasures wealth: Such men will thee: prayse wyse to bee, if thou so helpst thy selfe. 20 That thou also: wyth them myghtst go, theyr fathers steps to sue: Where they no lyght: shall see in syght, for theyr excesse vndue. 21 Man lyuyng thus: all gorgious, who vnderstandyng wanth: Is lyke to beast: wyth them to rest, whose fame is short and scant, Psalme. L. The Argument. Here is reproued: the sacrifice, of Iewes for foolishe trust: And taught here is: wyth sad aduise, that thankes be yet more iust. Deus deorum Dominus. 1 The God of Gods: the lord of myght, one God in persons three: He bidth and calth: the earth in sight from East to West to see. 2 Thys God appeard: from Zyon hill, as God of beauty most: From whence he would: should spring his wil and law to euery coast. 3 Our God is come: in tyme of grace, he wyll no silence keepe: Wyth wastyng fire: before hys face, about hym tempest deepe. 4 The heauen aboue: the earth below, he doth vpon them call: Hys people all: to iudge and know, to helpe them that be thrall. 5 Collect ye now: my sayntes sayth he, in one, before my sight: Who stand in leage: and pact wyth me, by sacrifices ryte. 6 The heauens shall sprede: hys iustice cleare, that all the world may spy: That God himselfe: wyll iudge appeare, the good from bad to try. Sela 7 My people heare: for thus I say, thy selfe to wytnesse iust: O Israell: thy God alway, thy God I am to trust. 8 For sacrifice: or burnt incence, I wyll not thee reproue: To blame therin: thy negligence, to send them me aboue. 9 From out thy house: I wyll not craue, Bull, Bullocke, Oxe, or calfe: Of thy folde els: he goates to haue, to ioy of theyr behalfe. 10 The beastes that grase: the wood so wyde, they be all myne at wyll: On thousand hyls: the beastes that stryde, I made them thee to fill. 11 On mouataynes foules: that vse theyr flyght, I know them all and some: Wylde beastes of field: be nye my sight, as made for my renoume. 12 If hungers stresse: though myght I fele, I would not tell it thee: The world all whole: euen euery dele, is myne and all ye see. 13 And thinkst thou thus: so grosse in wit, that I buls flesh would eate? Or bloud of Goates: to drynke of it, as bloud to spill were sweete? 14 Na this it is: that I allow, to God aye offer thankes: And pay to God: of lyfe thy vow, and seeke none other crankes. 15 In all thy wo: call thou on mee, when troubles thee do thrust: I wil (no fayle) deliuer thee, thus shalt thou prayse me iust. 16 But God thus chect: vngodly man, what meanst to preach my lawes? My pact in mouth: why takest thou than, where lyfe hath wycked sawes. 17 To be correct: by discipline, thou hatest to heare the worde: So thou doost cast: at backe of thyne, my law of sweete recorde. 18 When thefe thou spiest: wyth him thou goest, to part the spoyle in hast: Who wedlocke breake: with them thou boast, thy lot wyth them is cast. 19 To cursed speche: thy tonge thou dightst, to clout all crafty guile: The iust thou wringst: the bad thou quytest, by lawes pretense and style. 20 Thou sitst as iudge: thy brothers name, by sleit to ouer runne: Thou quarell pikst: in crafty frame, agaynst thy mothers sonne. 21 Whyle thus thou doost: I sayeng nought, thou iudgest me nought lyke thee: But yet I shall: what thou hast wrought, detect before thyne eye. 22 O ponder this: I do you pray, all you that God forget: Lest I in hast: plucke you away, in wo to see you set. 23 Who offer me: the sacrifice, of thankes he honorth mee: And thys the way: wherby I vyse, Gods helth to let hym see. The Seconde Quinquagene of Dauids Psalter, translated into Englishe Metre. Psalme. LI. The Argument. A prayer pure and forme full good, for penitentes so meeke: Thus Dauids hart: enbrued wyth bloud, hys God for grace dyd seeke. Miserere mei deus 1 Haue mercy God: on me I craue, for thy great gentlenes: Thy mercies store on me vouchsaue, put out my sinfulnes. 2 But washe me depe: from all my sinne, for deepely falne I am: O clense me clere: wythout, wythin, from synne that beastly came. 3 For I confesse: my wyckednes, my state I fele most vyle: In sight I beare: my giltines, it doth myne eye reuyle. 4 To thee alone: I trespaced, I sind before thyne eyes: That iust in word: thou mightst be tryed, thou iudge so pure to ryse. 5 Behold in sinne: I shapen was, in natyue filth infect: My mother me: conceyud alas, in sinne of Adams sect. 6 But lo thou hast: the truth well loued, in hart alway to raigne: Thys wisdome hid: to few approued, thou shewest to me most playne. 7 Thou shalt me purge wyth Isope grene, so clensd, men me shall know: Thou shalt me washe: to be full clene, more whyte than is the snow. 8 Thou shalt make me: much ioye to heare, and rest for all my payne: My shaken bones shall them besteare, and ioye then once agayne. 9 From my misdedes: turne thou thy face, I cannot say to oft: From out thy bookes: my gilt O rase, to feele thy mercy soft. 10 Apuer hart: make thou in me, O God both good and true: A rightful sprite: wythin to be, my soule agayne renue. 11 From open sight of thy swete face, O Lord reiect me not: Withdraw not thou: thy sprite of grace, from me so desolate. 12 Thy ioyfull health: restore wyth all, to me thus tost wyth wo: Wyth sprite most free: and principall, strength me agayne to go. 13 Then wyll I teache: thy wayes for ryght, to all the wycked sort: That they to the: conuerted quyte, for comfort may resort. 14 Ryd me from all: bloudgiltines, thou God my God of health: My tonge shal sing: thy ryghteousnes, and iust condemne my selfe. 15 O Lord my lips: set open wyde, in thankes to make them free: So shall my mouth: on euery side, geue laudes most due to thee. 16 For thou regardst: no sacrifice, I would els geue it thee: Nor yet requirst: by law precise, our offrings brent that bee. 17 The sacrifice: to God elect, is iust a troubled sprite: Good God thou wylt: no tyme reiect a broken hart contrite. 18 O shew thy grace: and fauour yet, to Syon Dauids throne: Ierusalem: that citie great, build thou her wals of stone. 19 Then ryghteous hostes: thou shalt allow, whole offrings burnt in sight: Wyth sacrifice: of calfe and cow, they shall thyne aulters dyght. Psalme. LII. The Argument. This Psalme inueith: and is full wroth, agaynst oppressours myght: To Christ so Iudas fygure goth, to Dauid Doegs spyte. Quid glo riaris. 1 Why boast thy selfe: thou tyraunt thus? in malice vauntyng aye? Knowst not that God is gracious? to good men day by daye? 2 Thy tong contriueth: all crokednes, of hartes aboundance great: Wyth guiles it cutteth in craftines, as rasour sharply whet. 3 Thou malice louest: aboue all good, to hurt more then to helpe: To hatch more lyes: then truth to broode, lyke Adams byrd and whelpe. Sela 4 Thou hast but loued: to speake all nought, that may perdition bring: O thou false tong: thou hast but sought, deceite by flatteryng. 5 Therfore shall God: quite thee subuert, thy house to take from thee: And roote thee out: all ouerwhart, no lyuing land to see. Sela. 6 In seyng thys: the ryghteous man, shall feare and worshyp God: And shall say thus to scorne hym than, in Gods so heauy rod. 7 Lo thys the man: that had no lust, in God hys strength to set: But he in heapes: of gold dyd trust, by sinne hys strength he met. 8 But I am lyke: in God hys house, a fruitfull Olyue grene: In Gods good grace: most piteous, my trust shall aye be sene. 9 I will laude thee: for euer iust, thy word doth neuer mis: Thy name so good: shall be my trust, wyth good men good it is. Psalme. LII. The Argument. This psalm aforesaid in an other Metre. Thus clawbackes heare theyr shame Whom God shall once consume: They Princes hartes enflame, Wyth causeles ire to fume. Quid glo riaris. 1 Why bragst in malice hye? O thou in mischiefe stout: Gods goodnes yet is nye, All day to me no doubt. 2 Thy tong to muse all euyll, It doth it selfe inure: As rasour sharpe to spill, All guile it doth procure. 3 Thou malice louedst to wrye, Aboue all goodnes walke: And more thou louest to lye, Then righteousnes to talke. Sela. 4 Yea loued thou hast no lesse, To speake one worde for all: All wordes of noughtines, Thou tong in fraude most thrall. 5 But God once thee shall wast, Shall stroy and scrape by hand: Thy tent from thee at last, To roote thee out of land. Sela 6 And ryghteous men shall see, And feare therby shall take: But yet at hym full free, Good laughter shall they make. 7 O lo the man hymselfe, That made not God hys ayde: That trustd in ryches wealth Whose myght in mischiefe layde. 8 But I as Olyue greene, In Gods sweete house shall lay, My trust hath euer bene, In Gods good grace for ay. 9 I thee shall laude euen still, For thys thou dydst say I: Thy name to wayte I wyll, For good thy sayntes it spy. Psalme. LIII. The Argument. Our natyue sinne this Psalme detecth, that sinners all be we: And that from grace who be reiect, confounded must they be. Dixit insipiens. 1 The foole haue sayd: in hart euen so, no God at all to bee: Wherfore corrupt foule sinne they do to do good, none wyll see. 2 God looked down: from heauen so hye, on Adams children all: Some prudent man: if he could spye, that God would seeke or call. 3 But they be all astrayd and gone, abhominable made: That would do good: not one, not one, corrupt in all theyr trade. 4 Know they no thyng: in hart so stoure, these wycked workers all? My flocke as bread which do deuoure, nor yet on God they call. 5 They were afrayd: where feare dyd lacke, to shame God put them ryght: Men pleasers bones: God all to brake, for he abhorde them quite. 6 Oh that by God to Israell, from Syon health were had: Hys people thrall: no more to dwell, to make all Iury glad. Psalme. LIIII. The Argument. The iust here prayth hys God at neede, By hym hys ayde to winne: Hys fayth so good must nedely speede, Hys eye seeth proofe therin. Deus in nomine. 1 O saue me God: auouch me now, for thy names sake I pray: In thy great myght: my ryght alow, auenge me Lord I say. 2 O God so good: my prayer heare, thy grace I do appeale: My wordes of mouth: accept wyth eare, which hart doth now reueale. 3 For straungers lo: at me they rise, and tyrauntes seke my soule: They haue no God: before theyr eyes, they me both pill and powle. Sela 4 Behold for God: my helper is, and stay of all my lyfe: With other mo, he chiefe I wis, who stayth my soule from stryfe. 5 Euen he shall all: my foes despite, into theyr laps retort: Lord dryue them downe: thy truth so hyght, for thou art whole my fort. 6 I will wyth hart most glad and free, geue sacrifice to thee: I shall thy name (Lord) magnifie, so good it is to mee. 7 For thou hast ryd: me quyte in deede, from all my griefe and wo: As I did wishe: my foes to speede, I saw theyr ouerthrow. Psalme. LV. The Argument. As Dauid mournd to shame reiect, by them who semed his frendes: The same did Christ, as his elect, in lyke may haue lyke myndes. Exaudi. 1 Geue eare O God: to my request, in anguishe all be set: Hyde not thy selfe: to myne vnrest, from me thyne eares to shet. 2 Geue hede to me: thy grace impart, to my depe cry and call: I mourne therin: and grone in hart, now here, now there I fall. 3 For that my foes: so cry and rore, and me wyth spyte approche: They mischiefe meane: and euermore, in wroth they me reproche. 4 My hart doth faynt: sore vext it is, in great disquietnes: Yea feares of death: be not remisse, to do my hart distres. 5 Both feare and dread: thus tossing me, my tremblyng neuer blin: Darke horrors depe: full prest they be, all whole to wrap me in. 6 Wherfore I sayd: O that I had, to flye winges lyke a doue: Then would I flye: to rest full glad, and me from hence remoue. 7 No dout far of: I would me flitche, From hence to wildernes: More there to dwell: than here wyth such, in such vnrestfulnes. Sela. 8 I would make hast: to scape away, as fast as wynde could blow: To flee thys storme: and tempest aye, I would me safe bestow. 9 Destroy them Lord: theyr tonges deuyde, theyr counsayles scatter wyde: Theyr citie wryth: to wrong a syde, to stryfe and churlishe pryde. 10 Both day and nyght: theyr citie walles, are thus enuyroned: In mids therof: all mischiefe falles, and sorrow there exceedth. 11 All noughtines: and vyce doth raygne, in Ceyla citie so: 1. Reg. 23 Deceyt and guile: wyth all that trayne, theyr streetes full thorough go. 12 No open foe: workth me thys spyte, for hym then would I beare: No enmy known: thus raysth hys myght, whom I myght flee and feare. 13 But thou my mate: most deare to hart, as was my lyfe in state: Whom I esteemd as guide in part, as homely fellow grate. 14 Wyth whom so knit: we often tooke, both meate and counsayle sweete: We neyther others once forsooke, in Gods house aye to meete. 15 Let death them trap: full sodenly, euen quicke to fall to hell: For vice wyth them: doth lodge and ligh, theyr hartes wyth falshode mell. 16 But as for me: to God I cryed, and hence hym pray I wyll: The Lord saued me: full oft I tryed, I trust he shall do still. 17 At euen and morne I made my sute, at noone day instantly: No tyme my cry: dyd he refute, thus made importunely. 18 For he redeemd: my soule to peace, from war agaynst me set: For many were wyth me to ease, though they in numbers met. 19 Yea God himselfe: whych aye hath bene, shall heare me them to scourge: No tyme to change: they wyll be sene, wyth feare to God assurge. 20 He rearde hys handes: agaynst hys frendes, which ment hym peace and rest: He brake hys league: that men so byndes, together fast in brest. 21 Hys mouth more soft: then butter melt, though warre was stiffe in hart: More smooth then oyle: hys wordes were felt, yet were sharpe dartes and smart. 22 O cast thy care: on God so deare, what burthen thee oppresse: He will thee feede: he cannot beare, the iust to fall in stresse. 23 And thou O God: shalt stroy the fetche, of crafty bloudy men: Theyr dayes to halfe: shall neuer retche, to thee I yeld me then. Psalme. LVI. The Argument. This prayth to God as innocent, Agaynst his foes so mad: As Christ though pure: the Iewes dyd shent, Yet he reioyceth full glad. Miserere mei deus 1 Haue mercy God: on me I pray, for man will treade me downe: His fierce assaut: from day to day, would make my hart to sowne. 2 To swalowe me: my foes entend, as daily bent they lygh: Full many one: do war extend, on me, O thou most high. 3 But euer when: such feares inuade, my hart, to make me flee: I trust yet well, therout to wade, my fayth so cleauth to thee. 4 Prayse God I wyll: and trust hys worde, what hys good hand doth send: I feare not fleshe: hys spyte and sworde, to God my trust shall bend. 5 For daily me: they do depraue, both what I do and say: In hart and tonge: at me they raue, and me to harme they lay. 6 They flocke on me: and priuely, conspyrde they haue in stealth: They wayte my wayes: my steps to stye, to stroy my soule and wealth. 7 They put theyr hope: by guilefulnes, and craft, to scape away: Yet once O God: thou wylt them stres, in ire, for all theyr stray. 8 Thou seest my flightes: and often feares, thou markst them all full out: Wythin thy bottell put my teares, the booke them noteth no dout? 9 As oft as I: do call on thee, my foes then take theyr slight: Therby my hart: doth full agree, that God for me doth fight. 10 Of thys my God: for promyse iust, I wyll hym laude and prayse: God wyll I prayse: and all my trust, in hym I set alwayes. 11 On God I haue: me whole bestowde, a tyme though I be thrall: What flesh can do: though all beshrowd, I feare no whit at all. 12 Now fit for me: my vowes to pay, to God they be so hyght: And hym due laudes: to sing by day, and thankes in open sight. 13 For thou my soule: hast ryd from death, from fall thou keepst my feete: To walke in lyght: whyle lyfe hath breath, before my God so sweete. Psalme. LVII. The Argument. The iuct for his deliuery, geueth thankes that God hym sped: So Christ reioyste when he dyd stye, to heauen when death was ded. Miserere mei deus 1 God pity me: O pitie me, on thee my soule is cast: Thy wynges I trust: wyll shadow be, till all thys spyte be past. 2 Thy trusty helpe: I wyll implore, of God my Lord most hye: He wyll my cause: perfourme the more, that now in hand doth ligh. 3 He shall from heauen: send down hys power to saue from me their spite: And those that would: my soule deuower, wyth shame shall full be dight. 4 Twixt Lyons fierce: doth stand my lyfe, wyth fiery men I dwell: Whose teeth be speares: and dartes in stryfe, theyr tonges sharpe swordes and fell. 5 Aduaunce thy selfe: O God appeare, from heauens more hye thon they: Thy glory great: set vp so cleare, on all the earth to stay. 6 To catche my feete: a net they splayd, my soule they haue deprest: Into that pyt: for me they layd, themselues therin be threst. Sela. 7 My hart is fixt: my hart is fixt, O God in thee full stayd: And sing I will: my griefes betwixt, in psalmes wyth musike playd. 8 Awake my tonge: my ioy awake, awake both harpe and lute: Come forth, at morne: I me betake, to sing wyth shaume and flute. 9 Thy laudes wyth thankes: out wyll I sound, when people meete aryght: To sing O Lord: to thee so bound, I wyll in Paynyms syght. 10 Thy mercy great: to heauens doth retch, what thyng can it denay? To heauenly cloudes: thy truth doth stretch, to mans most stable stay. 11 Set vp thy selfe: O God aboue, the heauens as is most meete: Aboue the earth: thy glory moue, the stoole of both thy feete. Psalme. LVIII. The Argument. Saules counsaylours: so far fro ryght, This Psalme doth here dewray: Whose craftes wyth like: shall God requite. To sing once well away. Si vere vtique. 1 If iust your myndes: be truly set, ye counsaylours to ryght? Iudge equally: in weyght and met, ye sonnes of men in syght. 2 Yea ye in hart: do nothyng lesse, in earth to wrong ye bende: Your handes do worke: all wyckednes, though ye the ryght pretende. 3 These wycked walke: in froward wyse, from euen theyr mothers mylke: Once borne they stray? and talke but lyes, theyr wordes yet soft as silke. 4 Theyr poyson lyke: the poyson is, of venome cockatryce: Euen Adder lyke: all deafe I wis, who stopth her eares to ryse. 5 Who hateth to heare: the charmers voyce, charme he so neuer wyse: Of ryght and wrong: they make no choyce, all warnyng they despyse. 6 Wythin theyr mouthes: theyr teeth O God, crushe thou, they be to sharpe: The Lyons mouthes: theyr iawes so brode, breke Lord, proud wordes they carpe. 7 To nought they passe: as water swyft, wythin it selfe doth slyde: And when to shoote: theyr shaftes they list, let them go broken wyde. 8 As snayle that wasth: let them so wast, thus creepyng crookedly: As womans byrth: to tymely cast, let them no sunne espy. 9 As tender ympes: of wycked thorne, before theyr pryckes be hard: Men roote them vp: so all be torne, by wrath they shall be marde. 10 Then shall reioyce: the iust and good, to see Gods vengeaunce come: To bathe hys handes: in sinners bloud, and thanke for hys good dome. 11 Then man shall say: wythouten mis, the iust hath iust reward: No doubt a God: in earth there is, to iudge in ryght regard. Psalme. LIX. The Argument. Agaynst the proud: is made request Who dealth wyth guile and fraude: Whom God shall driue: to want theyr rest, with famine ouer yawde. Eripe me de inimicis. 1 From all my foes: deliuer me, O God my God thou art: Shield me from them: in suertie, that vp at me be start. 2 From workers bad: O saue my lyfe, wyth them no tyme to mell: From bloudy men: whole set to strife, make me most far to dwell. 3 For lo they wayt: my soule to catch, these freakes be met in spyte: Though iust offence: they cannot latch, at me O Lord of ryght. 4 Yet causeles they: styll flocke at mee, to hurt they them prepare: Aryse therfore: O Lord and see, helpe me now plungd in care. 5 Stand vp thou God: and Lorde of hostes, thou Lord of Iacobs lyne: All Paynyms (Lord) vew thou theyr bostes, spare not theyr wilfull cryme. Sela 6 They go at euen: both to and fro, they grin as dogs to bite: The streates they trot: in citie so, as pickethankes them delyte. 7 Behold they speake: wythin theyr mouth, but swordes wythin theyr lyps: They thinke belyke: none heare the sothe, from them that falshode slips. 8 But thou O Lord: shalt them deryde, to scorne theyr mad attempt: These heathen dogs: that barke so wyde, from thee who can exempt? 9 My strength I will: kepe fast by thee, O God I will not shrynke: Of thee I know: all strength to bee, as rocke on thee I thynke. 10 For God of grace: wil me preuent, wyth mercy plentuously: And how my foes: shall once be shent, God shal make me to spy. 11 Yet slea them not: all sodenly, lest them my flocke forget: But scatter them: a stray to fly, deiect them Lord so great. 12 Theyr sinne of mouth: theyr word of tong, theyr pryde shall them betray: For periury: they speake and wrong, they prate but lyes all day. 13 Consume them Lord: in hasty wrath, consume them lest and most: To know that guide: true Iacob hath, euen God in euery cost. 14 These men at euen: will them retyre, they grenne as dogs to byte: The citie they: walke all on fyre, as pickethankes them delyte. 15 For meate they range: both here and there, still hungry let them bee: And satisfied: be they no where, no rest or sleepe to see. 16 But I shall sing: thy strength and power, at morne to prayse thy grace: For thou hast bene: my fort and tower, In all my wofull race. 17 O thou my strength: all whole alone, to sing to thee I shall: Thou refuge wart: in all my mone my God most liberall. Psalme. LX. The Argument. Whyle Saule dyd raigne: all Iury mournde, by Paynyms sore opprest: In fayth to God: here Dauid tournd, and conquerd them to rest. Deus repulisti. 1 O God thou hast repeald vs long, and scattred vs abrode: Thy heauy wrath: fell vs among, O turne and stay thy rod. 2 Euen thou that hast: sore shakt our land, well nye to shiuers rent: Heale thou the brekes: by thy good hand, it realeth to ruine bent. 3 Most dreadfull sightes: and dolorous, thou madest thy people spy: Such wyne thou gauest: for drynke to vs, which greued vs inwardly. 4 Yet hast thou geuen: thyne arke as signe, to such as feare thy name: To blanke theyr foes: that would repyne, thy truth protesth the same. Sela. 5 Thy louers all: great daungers fled, and rid from harmes full safe: By thy right hand: let me be led, and my requestes vouchsaue. 6 God spake the worde: in sanctuary, which makth me glad to byde: I Sychem will: part myne to lye, and Succoth vale deuyde. 7 Myne Gilead: Manasses myne, both twayne be myne intiere: My strength of head: is Ephraim, and Iuda legistere. 8 So Moab stout: shall bow hys head, to serue as washepot aye: On Edom land: my shoo shall tread, ioy thou Philistea. 9 Than who shall lead: me strayt to flye, into the citie strong: Who me will bring: to Idomye, to conquere them among. 10 Art thou not he: O God I say, which thus hast cast vs out? Whych dydst refuse: to lead the way, to guide our armies stout? 11 O than be thou: our helpe at nede, to ease our troubles yet: For humayn helpe: is vayne to speede, mans arme to weake is set. 12 No doubt by God: we shall achyue, great acts we trust euen thus: For he alone: our foes shall dryue, to treade them down for vs. Psalme. LXI. The Argument. This prayth in payne and stresse: as far exylde and fled, and thanks it giueth: for succor sent, it figurth chrict our hed Exaudi Domine. 1 My cryeng heare O God, That voyce doth sing in song: Geue eare to me: thus cast abrode, as fled for feare of wrong. 2 From furthest coastes of earth, To thee shall come my cry: Whyle hart feelth griefe: to rocke me lead, That hygher is than I. 3 For thou hast bene my trust, In whome I hopt alone: Of refuge strong: and tower so sure, To fence from me my fone. 4 In thyne owne tente by thee, For aye I trust to dwell: Wythin thy wynges: most couertly, Sela. To lye I trust full well. 5 For thou my God hast heard, My vowes and prayers sad: And them thou gauest: an heritage, Thy name who duly drad. 6 The kyng hys dayes wyth dayes, Thou shalt encrease in length: Hys yeares to be: perpetuall, Euen thus thou shalt hym strength. 7 For euer he shall dwell, Before hys God in sight: O than prepare: hym grace and truth, Which may defend hys might. 8 In Psalmes to prayse thy name, I will whyle world doth last: And pay my vowes most thankfully, From day to day as fast. Psalme. LXII. The Argument. This Psalme exhorth: to God to stand, Agaynst all mens pursuites: It shewth to faith: Gods mighty hand, Mans brags it vayne reputes. Nonne deo subiecta. 1 Shall not [illeg.] my soule: in silence looke, to God as subiect still? From whom my helth: and helpe I tooke, when woes my hart dyd fill? 2 No dout he is my rocke and health, my fort of strength and ayde: I trust the lesse: by foes in stealth, to fall as one dismayde. 3 How long wyll ye: wyth wycked guiles, thus me poore man inuade? Ye all shall quayle: as wall that reales, as rotten hedge doth fade. 4 To driue hym low: they mete for this, whom God would haue excell: They loue but lyes: theyr tonges can blisse, theyr hartes yet curse to fell. Sela 5 But yet my soule: to God be still, in silence pacient: And tary him: in quiet wyll, from whom shall health be sent. 6 No doubt I say: he is my strength, my health, my fortresse hye: I feare no foyle: to shrynke at length, where God doth fortifie. 7 Wyth God is layd: my health full sure, and he my glory iust: My rocke of strength: that wyll endure, in God is whole my trust. 8 Trust aye in hym: ye people whole, to hym poure out your hartes: Our hope is God: O hym extoll, he health alway impartes. 9 But Adams broode: is vayne to see, mens children lyers bee: They wayghed in schooles: ascend more hye, more lyght then vanitie. 10 Then hope ye not: (lest vayne ye be) in wrong and robbery: If ryches flow: aboundantly, no hart to them apply. 11 God once dyd speake: and once agayne, and twyse I haue it harde: That power is Gods: in stable raigne, which we should all regarde. 12 And that O Lord: in thee aryght, is mercy mixt also: For thou shalt quite: to euery wyght, in deede as he shall do. Psalme. LXIII. The Argument. Deus deus meus ad te. Poore Christen man: opprest by might, May pray this psalme: with Christ hys head, Who lawdes to God: did pay aright, In desert set: where lyfe he led. 1 O God to thee: my God so strong, From mornyng watch: I cry in stresse My soule and flesh: for thee they long, In desert land, dry, waterlesse. 2 Thus thee I trust: to see in place, Where resth thy grace: in holynes: That I myght see: thy mighty face, Thy glory hye: and noblenes. 3 For better is: thy goodnes yet, Than is thys lyfe: the blessednes: Wherfore my lips: shall still beset, To sing thy prayse: and worthines. 4 Thus all my lyfe: (Lord) thee shall blisse, And render thankes: obeysantly, To lyft my handes: I wyll not misse, Thy holy name: to glorifye. 5 Lo thus my soule: full frankt shall bee, As fed wyth fat: and marow sweete: When that my mouth: in laudes so free, Shall ioyous breake: to Carols meete. 6 Euen thus of thee: I myndefull was, When that in bed: I tooke my rest: As watches all: the nyght dyd passe, Of thee I musde: in gratefull brest. 7 Because thou wart: my helpe at neede, as helpe thou couldst: and so thou hast: Therfore I wyll: reioyce in deede, Wythin thy winges: thus safely plast. 8 For when my soule: was set to thee, As fast to ioyne: in feares assaut: Thy mighty hand: then leande to mee, And stayd me vp: wythout defaut. 9 Now these which seeke: my soule to spyll, To bryng me downe: to see my graue: In vayne I trust: they worke in wyll, Theyr wynding sheete: they first shall haue. 10 Wyth edged sworde: they shall be threst, As they deuisde: to me full flye: They shall be prayes: to sauage beast, In Foxes lyues: lyke Foxe to dye. 11 The kyng in God: yet shall reioyce, For hys defence: in suertie: Who swerth to hym: shall ioy the choyce, For glauering lips: all stopt shall bee. Psalme. LXIIII. The Argument. Heare Dauid blamth: hys foes attempt, and telth how dye they shall: So Christ reprouth: the Iewes contempt, and prophecieth theyr fall. Exaudi Domine. 1 O heare my Lord: my voyce and cry, in tellyng thus my woes: And kepe my life: in suertie, from feare of all my foes. 2 And hyde me Lord: from all the trayne, of cursed men in close: From all theyr rowte: conspired agayne, in wycked lyfe so lose. 3 Which wheth theyr tonges: as sword so sharpe and poyson dartes they shoote: Euen bitter wordes: in tonge they carpe, to bring me vnder foote. 4 To shoote at hym: in stelth they lye, who lyfe intiere doth beare: On hym vnwares: theyr dartes they wry, and haue therin no feare. 5 They strength themselfes in wycked pryde, theyr crafty fetch to ply: They do conferre: theyr snares to hyde, they say who them can spy? 6 They searche all spite: and do it round, that is by search comprisd: What hartes most depe: or wit profound, can fynde, is hye deuisde. 7 But God shall shoote: at them agayne, hys arrowes sodenly: Wyth sundry woundes: he them shall payne, all vnbewares to spye. 8 He then shall make: theyr proper tonge, theyr owne confusion: That who them see: how they be wrunge, shall shake as wo begone. 9 All men shall see: thys worke ryght well, and much commend this acte: As wrought by God: they shall it tell, and wisely note the facte. 10 The ryghteous man: shall ioy in God, in hym to put his trust: Yea all true hartes: shall ioy abrode, that God kept me so iust, Psalme. LXV. The Argument. For foyson thankes to God: the letter doth aforde, the sprite for that the church encreasth: by dews of his swete worde. Te decet. 1 Al laudes be due to thee: O God in Zyon hil: with harty vowes: of th?ks to thee, all Sal? shal we fil 2 Which hearst requests so light: in faith made fast to thee all men for this: to thee ful glad, shal come in eche degree. 3 Ungodly dedes preuaild: on me so lowd they cryde: but thou our sins: wilt purify: as oft we haue if tryed. 4 O blest is he in all: whom thou doost chose and take: in thy courtes he: shall dwel full fed: where he al ioy shall make. 5 O God most drad in ryght, heare vs thou art our health: To them that dwell: by sea or land, thou art theyr onely wealth. 6 Which mountains didst prepare: by theyr own str?gth to rest, So gyrt he is: with fortitude, of all the worthyest. 7 Which swagth the ragyng seas: wyth all theyr roring dinne So all vprores: of multitudes: to stowage he doth winne. 8 And they that furthest dwel: in earth thy signes shall dread: Theyr goinges forth: at nyght &amp; morne: thy laudes shall duely spread. 9 Thou vewst the earth for good: thou makest it rich in store, Gods fluds be ful: men food thou geuest: thou framdst the earth therfore 10 Her forowes thou doost moyst: thou breakst the clods in two: Thou makest th? soft: wyth rainy drops: her fruites thou blest euen so. 11 Thou crownst the earth full whole: wyth thy riche gentlenes thy cloudes as waynes: do cary showers, they drop fat plenteousnes. 12 Theyr fatnes eke distilth: on desert pastures wyde: The little hils: depe wet by them: shal ioy on euery side. 13 The playnes wyth flocks bespred: the vales w? wheat ful clad, Thus shal reioyce: and mercy sing: for fruitefulnes so glad. Psalme. LXVI. The Argument. An hymne of thankes to God: for helpe in tyranny: With sacrifice: the Iewes it song: in feastes most solempnely. Iubilate. 1 Reioyce to God wyth ioy: how wyde the land ye dwell: Expresse your ioyes: to shew how hie: his Godhed doth excell 2 And loke wyth song ye prayse: hys name most glorious: And thynke it is: your glory most: hys fame most hye to rowse. 3 Say thus before the Lord: how workst thou dreadfully? Thy power shall make: thy foes to stoupe: therin though fallen they lye 4 The earth all whole full low: shall worshyp thee as God: And sing in psalmes: they shal to thee: to sound thy name abrod[illeg.] Sela 5 O come and note Gods workes: how wonderfull they are, So wrought to man: of Adams lyne: they passe mans wyt to [illeg.] 6 He turnd the sea to land: whose worke alone it is: that through the sea: dry shod they went: our fathers ioyd of t[illeg.] 7 He rulth the world by myght: hys eyes the Paynyms ve[illeg.] And who rebels: as voyd of fayth: no grace shall them ensue. Sela. 8 O blisse our God wyth thanks: ye people more and lesse: And see ye cause: all speche &amp; voyce: that they his laudes expresse. 9 For he hath set our soule: in lyfe most safe and sound: He suffreth not: our feete to slyde: to slyp vpon the ground. 10 For thou O God most hye: hast proued vs narowly: Thou hast vs tryed: as siluer is: by furnace fined therby. 11 Thou broughts vs nye to traps: of foes besieged strayt: Our loynes &amp; backs: bare painful lodes: of griefs in heuy way. 12 Thou hast set man on vs: on thus our heds to ryde: We past by fire: and water to: yet roume thou gauest vs wyde. 13 Thy house I wyll go in: wyth offringes brent therfore: My vowes to pay: I wyll not misse: to the behight before: 14 Which vowes dyd cause my lyps: themselfe to open wyde: All which my mouth: dyd promise iust: when trouble me did stryde. 15 Brent offryngs wyll I geue: to thee of lambes most fat: Wyth smoke of rambes: wyth oxe and goat: I wyll ful glad do that. Sela. 16 All ye that God do feare: O come and harken now: I wyll you tell: how louingly: my soule he dyd auow. 17 I dyd but cry wyth mouth: my hart felt strayght his ease: My tonge therfore dyd hym extoll: wyth prayse it did not cease. 18 I[illeg.] yet thus in hart: ought wyckedly had ment: The Lord my sute would not haue heard: in suttle false entent. 19 Where now the Lord heard me: by proofe it is discust: My voyce and vowe: in prayer made: he dyd consider iust. 20 O bless be God which did: no tyme my sute reiect. No tyme his grace forsooke my nede: he neuer me neglect. Psalme. LXVII. The Argument. Thys song in all: propheticall, Doth cleare expresse: Christes raigne in flesh Whose beames so bright: dyd shyne in sight, That all to come: must prayse his dome. Must prayse his dome. Deus mi sereatur. 1 God graunt wyth grace: he vs embrace, In gentle part: blisse he our hart: With louyng face: shyne he in place, His mercies all: on vs to fall. On vs to fall. 2 That we thy way: may know all day, Whyle we do sayle: thys world so frayle: Thy healthes reward: is nye declarde, As playne at eye: all Gentils spye. all Gentils spy. 3 Let thee alwayes: the people prayse, O God of blisse: as due it is: The people whole: mought thee extoll, From whome all thyng: they see to spryng. they see to spryng. 4 All folke reioyce: lyft vp your voyce, For thou in sight: shalt iudge them ryght: Thou shalt direct: the Gentiles sect: In earth that bee: to turne to thee. to turne to thee. 5 Let thee alwayes: the people prayse, O God of blis: as due it is: The people whole: mought thee extoll, From whom all thyng: they see to spryng. they see to spryng. 6 The earth shall bud: hys fruites so good, Then thankes most due: from it shall sue: And God euen he: our God most free. Shall blesse vs aye: from day to day. from day to day. 7 So God our guide: shall blesse vs wyde, Wyth all increase: no tyme to cease: All folke therby: on earth which ligh, Hys name shall feare, and loue hym beare. and loue hym beare. Psalme. LXVIII. The Argument. The Hebrues sang this Psalme in warre, against their foes to fight: So Christen man: at Christ his foes: may pray the same in sprite. Exurgat Deus. 1 Let God aryse: in maiestie: and scattred be hys foes: Yea flee they all: hys sight in face: to him which hateful goes 2 As smoke is driuen: &amp; comth to nought: repulse theyr tyranny: At face of fyre: as wax doth melt: Gods face the bad mought flee 3 But let the iust: be glad in thys: and ioy in God hys sight: For Gods great power: &amp; stable truth: in myrth let them delite. 4 O sing to God: sound out hys name: see hym ye magnify: He rydeth on heauens: hys name is God: in him reioyce ye hie 5 He father is: to fatherles: of widowes iudge he is: Euen God hymselfe: which euer dwelth: in holy place of hys. 6 Thys God he makth the desolate: in housholdes great to grow: He loseth the thrall: quyte out of bandes: and bringth the wycked low. 7 O God when thou: wentst forth as guide: before the people out When thou dydst walke in wyldernes: which thyng thou dydst no doubt. Sela 8 The erth then shooke: at face of god: the heuens did drop &amp; swel Mount Synay: Gods face dyd feare: Gods face of Israell. 9 Thou pourdst O God: thy fruitful shoures: on thine enherit?ce When faynt they were: wyth ease agayne: theyr strength y? didst aduaunce. 10 Thy church and flocke: to dwel therin: thou shalt it thus refresh: So thou prepardst: for all thy poore: O God in gentlenes. 11 Such good effect: god gaue hys word: to them y? shewd his might They dyd out preach: his armies strong: how they exceld in sight 12 How kyngs wyth hostes: most fiercely set: yet fled discomfited: And householdes whole: that kept at home: the spoyle they dyd deuyde. 13 Though ye haue lyne among the pots: as black as coale in sight ye shalbe whyte: as doue with winges: milke white and fethers bright 14 Wh?

This is gods mount: where God hath dwelt: he there shal dwel for aye. 17 Gods charets be: ten thousands twyse: of angels millions: Wyth them is God: wyth hys good grace: as God loued Syna ones. 18 Thou stiedst on hie: y? thraldom caughtst: receiuing gifts in men Yea faythles eke: thou tookst to grace: that God myght dwell in them. 19 O blest be God: who day by day: doth heape hys gyftes on vs: Thys God is God: of all our health: in power most glorious. Sela. 20 He is our God: euen God I say: all health and wealth to shape: Yea death is ruld: by God the lord: whose dint by him we scape 21 This God shal wound: his enmies heds: he shal their worthies qwel: Their heary scalpes: to pare full nie: that still in sinne wil dwel. 22 God sayd I will: restore as once: from Basan myne I dyd: I will returne: all myne as once: from seas most depe I ryd. 23 That dipt thy feete: in all their bloud: may reade appeare at eye: That dogs myght licke: their enmies bloud: so read to be therby 24 Who lyst did see: O puissaunt God: thy great procedings hie: The goings iust: of thee my God: my king in sanctuary. 25 Wh? thanks were song: first singers went: th? minstrels moued theyr feete: In myds were set: the damsel maides: who playd with timbrels sweete. 26 When they in one: were ioyntly met: thus god they praysed wel: From hart the ground: they blest the Lord: who sprang of Israel 27 Small Beniamin: there ruler went: so Iudas tribe theyr stone: So went the Pieres: of Zebulon: and Neptaly came on. 28 Thus god hath bid all str?gth &amp; power: for thee ful nye to be: With strength O God: c?firme this worke: that y? hast wrought so free. 29 Fr? thy sweete house: Ierusalem: make this thy strength procede Then kings shal bryng: theyr offerings: to thee to praise thy dede 30 The launce mens routes: once scatred wyde: the peoples calues once tamde: When they shal stoupe: and presentes bring: and warring folks once shamde. 31 Then shal the Pieres: of Egipt land: for this come meke in sight Then Ethiops: ful soone shal yeld: to God their hands and might 32 O all ye realmes: of all the earth: sing ye to God of blis.

Psalme. LXIX. The Argument. A sute of man in trouble bounde, that hath his hart opprest: To Christ and his: it nye doth sounde, as Paule somewhere exprest. Saluum me fac deus. 1 Saue me O Lord: in heauines, by woes depressed downe: The ragyng waues: of all distres, be falne my soule to drowne. 2 In myre so deepe: I sticke full fast, all bottomeles to see: In waters deepe: downe am I cast, the flouds haue whelmed mee. 3 In crying still: I wery go, my throate is horse and dry: Myne eyes be dimme: and fainty so, whyle God I wyshe to spy 4 My foes exceede: my heares of head, at me they causeles looke: My foes preuayle: that wyshe me dead, I payd I neuer tooke. 5 Thou know O God: my folishnes, if ought amisse I dyd: My crymes of lyfe: my simplenes, from thee be neuer hyd. 6 Who wayte on thee: feele they no bostes, of shame for my desert: O God the Lord: of Iacobs hostes, let them feele neuer smart. 7 For sooth for thee: susteyned I, both shame and vyle reproofe: My face is hyd: for infamy, so felt for thy behoofe. 8 I was repute: as stranger fremd, to all my brethren bad: As aliant: so me condemnd, my mothers children had. 9 For why, the zeale: of thy sweete house, hath me vp eaten quite: On me fell dedes: opprobrious, of them that thee did spyte. 10 I wept and fast: my soule to chast, my body low to bryng: Thus when I dyd: they did it cast, to my disabelyng. 11 When sackecloth course: I put me on, to mourne my griefe the more: Theyr laughyng stocke: and iestyng stone, they made me then therfore. 12 The Iudges eke: which sate in gate, on me they babled euill: So dyd on me: wyne bibbers prate, yea songes they made theyr fill. 13 Yet I O Lord: prayd whole to thee, in tyme acceptably: For thy great ruthe: and veritie, wyth helpe heare thou my cry. 14 O plucke me out: of myre and sand, before I sinke to steepe: Let me escape: my haters hand, to ryse from waters deepe. 15 Let me no tyme: by floudes and sea, all ouerflowne to bee: Nor let the deepe: vp swalow me, ne pit shit mouth on mee. 16 This graunt to mee: O God this day, thy grace is liberall: Turne thy respect: to me I pray: regard thy mercies all. 17 Hyde not thy face: and cherefull sight, from me thy seruant poore: For greuous woes: on me be lyght, make hast and heare therfore. 18 Draw nye my soule: to chalenge it, redeme and saue it well: For these my foes: so haut they sit, saue me from them so fell. 19 Thou knowst what spite: what shame I beare what vyle rebukes I feele: Myne enemies all: that me do deare, be known to thee full well. 20 The shame hath pearst: and rent my hart, I feele all hartes disease: I lookt if man would ease my smart, but none was me to ease. 21 In stede of meat: for my repast, they gaue me bitter gall: In my great thyrst: they esill cast, to quenche my thirst wythall. 22 Theyr table be: to them a snare, theyr sweete meates tournd to sowre: And that for ioy: they dyd prepare, let theare but sorrow lowre. 23 Theyr eyes be darke: to see no lyght, and wyt be far fro them: And make theyr loynes: to reele vpright, be they lyke drunken men. 24 Poure out thy wrath: these frekes to strike, who walke so stubburnely, And let thyne ire: and wrath a lyke, take hold of them full nye. 25 Theyr dwellyngs fyne: be they supprest, that they theyr country lose: In all theyr tents: let no man rest, theyr stocke no man to chose. 26 For whom thou smitest: they scourge in sport, as though thou wouldst them so: Of thyne afflict: and wounded sort, they talke wyth pleasure to. 27 O let them fall: from sinne to sinne, as thou dydst plague the blynde, And suffer not: that they go in, thy iustice it to fynde. 28 Be they cast out: of booke of lyfe, who thus impugne Gods grace: No where in booke: memoratiue, wyth iust men haue they place. 29 As now for me: for that I mourne, in paynes and dolours lye: Thy health to me: O God returne, to rayse vp me on hye. 30 Gods name I wyll: wyth prayse aduaunce, in song full deepe in hart: I will in hymnes: hys laudes enhaunce, hys grace to shew in part. 31 And thys shall please: God far aboue, (who is a sprite most pure) Then Oxe or calfe: wyth horne and houe, to offer hym (be sure) 32 The humble soules: shall thys beholde, reioyce they shall by lyue: And ye that seeke: the Lord, be bold, reioyce, your soule shall lyue. 33 For God no doubt: the nedy heareth, they may reioyce more hye: His prisoners: in eye he bearth, he cannot them defye. 34 Let heauen and earth: and all betwene, hys worthy laud set out: The sea and all: that creepth therin, prayse hym all round about. 35 For God shall saue: sweete Zyon hill, hys place of godly rest: And Iudas townes: build vp he will, to dwell in them possest. 36 Hys seruauntes true posteritie, shall it enherite iust: And they that loue: hys maiestie, of dwellyng theare may trust. Psalme. LXX. The Argument. The iust man here: calth God to ayde, To be protect: from hasty brayde, Of all hys foes (to hate) so ryfe: By hys good hand: to be well stayde, No tyme that he: be ouerlayde, By weakenes frayle (of all) his lyfe. Deus in adiutorium. 1 O God to me: thyne helpe intende, In hast thy selfe: to mercy bende, and me (O Lord) deliuer quite: Lyke grace I craue: that thou extend, Thy helpe from heauen: so downe to send, to ayde me strong: by (godly) might. 2 In hast be they: confounded all, Wyth shamefull name: men myght them call, Which seke (in hate) my soule to spill: Be they put backe: and dryuen to wall, All vyle reproofe: myght them befall, who that to me: wyshe (any) euill. 3 Euen strayt fled backe: let all them bee, For theyr reward: foule shame to see: these suttle (men but) glosers all: Whose tong to fawne: can whole agree, To say there there: lo thus to mee, by guile (and craft) to make me fall. 4 But let all those: that seeke thy myght, With gladnes full: and ioy be dyght, in thee theyr Lord (and God) all daye: And let them all: that haue delite, In thy sweete health: say still aryght, the Lord (so good) be praysed aye. 5 As now for me: though poore I ligh, Afflicted sore: in misery, O Lord to me make (hasty) speede: Thou art myne ayde: most trustely, My God of all: deliuery; to long (fro me) do not receede. Psalme. LXXI. The Argument. The iust geueth thankes: to God aboue, Who kept his youth in stay: So craueth he still: for further loue, In age no tyme to stray. In te domi ne speraui. 1 My trust O Lord: in thy good name, I haue (in hart) alway reposde: Let neuer me: be put to shame, from hope (I haue) to be deposde, 2 In thyne owne grace: and righteousnes, all quyte (from harme) deliuer me: Inclyne thyne eare: to my great stresse, to saue (my lyfe) and make me free. 3 Both rocke and wall: be thou to me, to which (most sure) I may resort: Thy will it is: that kept I be, my holde thou art and (stable) fort. 4 And make me scape: the tyrannye, my God (and Lord) of wycked foe: To scape the hand: of man to spye, both false (in hart) and cruell to. 5 Thou art my hope: and patience, O Lord for whom I (dayly) long: From euen my youth: my confidence, thou hast (no dout) bene euer strong. 6 For sith my birth: by thee alone, full sure (by thee) were kept my wayes: Thou pluckst me out: my mothers wombe, my mouth (therfore) shall sprede thy prayse. 7 A monster great: men me report, so many iudge (that be) vniust: But yet thou art: my stable fort, in whom is all my (hope and) trust. 8 O let my mouth: wyth prayses flow, that thee I may land (alway) thus: That I may sing: to hye and low, thyne honour (great most) glorious. 9 In tyme of age: reiect me not, that out (from thee) I be not cast: And leaue me not: all desolate, in (needefull) tyme when strength doth wast 10 For now my foes: together iet, in counsayle whole (they do) conspire: To rayle at me: they be all set, to trap my soule in (hateful) ire. 11 They say hym God: hath whole reiect, sue on (therfore) and take hym now: And full ye may: on hym be wrect, for none (in earth) wyll hym auow. 12 O God from me: depart not far, O God my God (to thee) I cry: From me thy helpe: do not debarre, make hast (to come) my foes be nye. 13 And let them all: confounded bee, to sinke (and drowne) who seke my soule, Let shame them take: and vilanie, who wishe my lyfe (my soule) to foyle. 14 As now for me: most quietly, I will abyde thy (louing) hand: Yea day by day: more earnestly, my mouth (and tonge) shall prayse thy sond. 15 My mouth shall tell: thy righteousnes, thy sauing health (to me) all day: But ende of this: great gentlenes, I can not thinke or (wholy) say. 16 In this my hope: I will go on, in God my Lord (so great) of power: I will expresse: of thee alone, thy truth (so ferme) both day and hower. 17 For thou O God: hast taught me well, from (all my) youth vnto this day: Thy meruels I: therfore will tell, thy wonders (great and) how they lay. 18 But me in age: when heares be white, depresse me not (O Lord) adowne: I will first tell: thy power and myght, this age (that is) and them to come. 19 For sure O God: thy truth is seene, to heauen (aboue) lyft vp so hye: Things great by thee: so wrought hath bene, who can (in power) be lyke to thee. 20 How great and sore: aduersitie, thou madest me oft (in lyfe) to spy: Yet didst thou turne: to quicken mee, from deepe (of stresse) to rayse me hye. 21 Beside thou didst: encrease my raigne, with honor (much so) more and more: When turnd thou wart: and pleasd agayne. of ioy (so glad) thou gauest me store. 22 I will thee prayse: in psaltry sweete, my God (and Lord) thy truth to tell: To thee my harpe: shall stand as meete, O Lord (so good) of Israell. 23 My lips and mouth: both fayne and glad, shall be (alway) to sing to thee: So shall my soule: for mercy had, Which thou (by grace) hast made so free. 24 My tonge shall talke: thy righteousnes, from day to day (and that) euen still: Because wyth shame: thou dydst represse, my foes (so fierce) that wisht me euill.

Deus iudicium. 1 Bestow O God: thy iudgements true Upon the kyng: annoynted due: Thy iustice eke: geue thou therto, To this kings sonne: in it to go. 2 Then shall he iudge: the people ryght, The good to saue: the bad to smyte: He shall the poore: afflict defend, The meke to quyte: the proud to bend. 3 The mountaines great: swete peace shal bring Unto thy folke: in gouernyng: The smaller hils: shall righteousnes, So sprede a lyke: in faythfulnes. 4 The simple sort: in misery, To holde their right: he shall applye: The poore mans childe: he shall protect, And briber stroy: that him so wrect. 5 They shall feare thee: in reuerence, As long as sunne hath influence: Or while the moone: her face doth showe, From age to age: from hye to lowe. 6 He shall come down: as rayn from seas, On grasse new shorne: or woll the flease: As showers sweete: on earth do lyte, To cheare all thing: in fruitfull sight. 7 In his good dayes: all rightwise men, Shall floryshe then and rise agayne: Sweete peace shalbe: on euery side, As long as Moone: her sphere doth ryde. 8 From sea to sea: his rule shalbe, From Palestyne: to deepe red sea: From Euphrates: to holy land, From cost to cost: how wyde it standth. 9 The Ethiopes: in wildernes, Full meeke to hym: shall bowe their knees: His foes shall seeme: to licke the dust, All prostrate ligh: to hym they must. 10 Of Tharsys kings: and other Iles, shall gifts present: him otherwhiles: Of arabye: and saba kings, shall humbly bryng: their offeryngs. 11 To make short tale: what kings there be, In earth must geue: hym homage free: Yea nations all: shall them submyt, To hold of hym: and kysse his feete. 12 For he the poore: shall soone releife, The crying wretch: to ryd from griefe: The nedy man: all comfortles, Without all helpe: he will release. 13 I saye agayne: he will be good, To nedy man: and poore of bloud: Though here he be: both torne and brent, Their soules to saue: he will consent. 14 Their soules from fraude: in vsurye, He will them ryd: that tyranny: Theyr names to him shall shine full cleare, Their bloud, his sight: shall count full deare. 15 And liue he shall: to hym shalbe, So geuen the golde: of Arabye: He shall for poore: make sute alway, The poore for it: shall prayse hym aye. 16 One hand full sowen: of wheate on hyll, For growth and length: then shake it will. In Lybanon: eke trees so hye, As greene as grasse: all townes shall lygh. 17 Hys name shall still: and aye endure, Before the sonne: it was full sure: Hys grace shall blesse: all people iust, All heathen him: shall prayse and trust. 18 This God our Lord: he blest full well, Euen iust the God: of Israell: He wondrous thinges: doth worke alone, All mysteries: by hym be done. 19 Hys name be blest: in vnitie, For euer one: in trinitie: This name shall fill: the earth agayne, Say we therto, Amen, Amen. The ende of the second booke. Here beginneth the thirde Booke of Psalmes. Psalme. LXXIII. The Argument. This musing Psalme: by Dauid made: to Asaph put to sing, Doth shew the endes of good and bad: what vice what vertue bringth. Quam bonus Israel Deus. 1 O good is God: to Israell, To them of perfect hart: Though wycked men: haue here the sweete, And good men feele the smart. 2 But yet my feete: wel nye were gone: to dout of godly wayes, My steps of lyfe: almost were slipt: to renne in lyke astrayes. 3 For why I fret: all whote in zeale: to note how sinners were: In peace wyth blisse: all whole beset: the good men all in feare. 4 For they of death: feele no distresse: nor much it doth them fret, Theyr strength is fresh: in euery part: well fed and fat they iet. Yet good is God to Israell, To them of perfect hart: Though wycked men: haue here the sweete, And good men feele the smart. 5 Misfortune none: befalth these men: no labour pressth them hard: They haue no scourge: as other men: all welth is theyr reward. 6 Of this ariseth: their hawty pride: wherin they vaunt so stout: All clad they bee: wyth wyckednes: and wrong euen round about. 7 With fatnes foule: theyr eyes be sweld: their gullets feele no thurst Their paunches ful: their helth so quart: theyr hartes excede in lust Yet good is God to Israell, To them of perfect hart: Though wycked men: haue here the sweete, And good men feele the smart. 8 And others they: corrupt with talke: they speake all that is nought They do blaspheme: euen God aboue: such rage dewraith their thought. 9 For vp to heauen: they cast their mouth: Gods prouid?ce to scorne Their tong in earth: must beare the rule: by them y? poore is lorne. 10 This makth all folke: to fall to them: to sue their wealth vnto: Their water cups: to drinke in part: to ease theyr want and wo. Yet good is God: to Israell, To them of perfect hart: Though wycked men: haue here the sweete, And good men feele the smart. 11 The people mad: tush say they all: do God such matters know? Hath God aboue: respect or care: of thinges so done below? 12 For lo say they: these wycked men: they prosper well in all: The world is theirs: as ioly men: all goodes to them befall. 13 And some of them: sayd thus agayne: my hart I clensd in vayne: To purge my lyfe: from suttle art: I count it folish payne. Yet good is God to Israell, To them of perfect hart: Though wycked men: haue here the sweete, And good men feele the smart. 14 Thus vext I went: afflict in hart: all day by wycked sect: In early morne: sore scourged I was: to haue this case detect. 15 I had almost: sayd euen as they: lo then I had bene wood: For so should I: haue euill reproued: thy flocke of children good. 16 I sought and sought: to search it out: O Lord what this might be: But thou O God: so secret wart: it was to hard for me. Yet good is God: to Israell, To them of perfect hart: Though wycked men: haue here the sweete, And good men feele the smart. 17 I doubted still: tyll God I sought: in hys most saintly place: To note hys wont: in all their endes: at last of all theyr race. 18 I spied thou setst: theyr slipper state: in brittle goodes vnclere: Thou cast th? down: on hed to nought: yea when most hie they were 19 O how they quayld: most sodenly: cast down and perisht quyte? For their misdeedes: &amp; wyckednes: to nought brought down in sight. Then good is God to Israell, To them of perfect hart: Though wycked men: haue here the sweete, And good men feele the smart. 20 As dreames so vayne: do vanyshe quite: from man y? wakth fr? slepe Theyr image Lord: so shalt thou stroy: thy citie not to kepe. 21 Myne inward ghost: sore vext it was: before this case I knew: It pearst my raynes: and rootes of hart: to note their workes vntrue 22 So fond I was: and ignorant: in secret workes of thee: To brute beast lyke: all voyde of wit: so dull thy trade to see. For good thou art: to Israell, To them of perfect hart: Though wycked men: haue here the sweete, And good men feele the smart. 23 But yet O lord: though thus I thought: I was held vp by thee: My right hand yet: thou heldst so vp: that far I dyd not flee. 24 As me thou taughtst: so hence thou wylt: teach me thy secret wil, And after that: with glory bright: my soule with ioy to fill. 25 For whome haue I: in heauen but thee: to loue or trust aright: Or who in earth: can health impart: but thou my harts delight. All good thou art to Israell, To them of perfect hart: Though wycked men: haue here the sweete, And good men feele the smart. 26 Though flesh &amp; hart: here fayled me: thou didst not me forsake: Thou art O God: my strength of hart: my part thou art to take. 27 For lo who far: from thee do stray: they perishe shall no doubt: A whoryng who: eke renne fro thee: thou driuest them al to nought 28 But good for me: by God to hold: in thee O God to trust: To tell thyne actes: how good thou art: in Syon gate full iust. O good is God to Israell, To them of perfect hart: Though wycked men: haue here the sweete, And good men feele the smart. Psalme. LXXIIII. The Argument. A sore complaint (here may) ye read, Agaynst Gods foes so vayne: Which Christ his worde: and eke his flocke, Pursue wyth myght and mayne, Vt quld Deus repulisti. 1 Why art so far: O God (our God) For euer wylt thou flee? Why fumeth thy wrath: agaynst thy sheepe, Of pasture (as we bee) 2 O God (our Lord) thinke thou vpon: thy congregation dere, Of olde so strong: possest by thee: whom thou redemst so clere. And thynke vpon the (chosen) lot: of thyne inheritaunce: Of Syon mount: wherin thou dwelt: wyth thy good ordinaunce. 3 Lift vp in hast: thy feete (and handes) confound thy foe in face: How hath he stroyd: thy sanctuary: the seat of thy good grace? Why art so far O God (our God) For euer wilt thou flee? Why fumeth thy wrath: agaynst thy sheepe, Of pasture (as we bee.) 4 Thy foes dyd rore (full hye) in pryde: in tyme of feastfull day: As conquest signes: in temple there: theyr banners did they splay. 5 Where he that once did (cut and) hew: a beame or sparre of wood: To beautifie: thy temple worke: was thought deuout and good. 6 But now they boast (and brag) herein: to pull all down to nought: To breake with mall: &amp; eke wyth axe: the gates of caruers wrought And yet art far: O God (our God) For euer wilt thou flee? Why fumeth thy wrath: agaynst thy sheepe, Of pasture (as we bee.) 7 Yea fyre (and flame) now haue they set: vpon thy holy place: They haue defylde: &amp; cast to ground: y? house where dwelt thy grace 8 They sayd (in wrath) to stroy them quite: let vs in one consent: Gods houses thus: in all the land: they haue all wholy brent. 9 We (now can) see no wonted signes: there is no Prophet more: Not one wyth vs: of wisdom sage: to ease our bondage sore. And yet art far: O God (our God) For euer wylt thou flee? Why fumeth thy wrath: against thy shepe, Of pasture (as we be.) 10 How long O God: shall thus (in spite) the aduersary brayd. Thy house, thy feastes: thy fold deface: hys brags at thee be layd? How long I say: shall he (so mad) thy holy name blaspheme, For euer thus: hym shall we see: thy power so lyght to deme? 11 Why than (O Lord) hold still thy handes: &amp; winkst at this his spite? Thy hand draw out: of bosom soone: to stroy thy foes by myght. Why art so far: O God (our God) For euer wylt thou flee? Why fumeth thy wrath: agaynst thy shepe, Of pasture (as we be.) 12 Yet God my kyng (and Lord) he is: of olde in yeares now gone: He health bestowd: on all the earth: himselfe doth it alone. 13 Thou didst deuyde the sea (as once) by myght of thy great hand: The Dragons heds: thou brakest in two: so drownd by sea &amp; land. 14 Thou crushedst the head of Whales (I say) Leniathan so great: For thy dere flocke: thou madest hym meat: which was in desert set. Then why art far from vs (O God) For euer wilt thou flee? Why fumeth thy wrath: agaynst thy sheepe, Of pasture (as we bee.) 15 Of stony rockes so (flinty) hard: thou broughtst out fluds &amp; springs And so thou driedst: great waters vp: for all theyr gatheryngs. 16 The nyght &amp; day: be thine (at will) thou spreadst both light &amp; sunne The sunne by day: to shyne so cleare: by nyght to shyne the Moone. 17 The costes of all: the earth (so wyde) thou dydst them place ful due Thou summer madest: and wynter both: eche other right to sue. And yet art far: from vs (O God) For euer wylt thou flee? Why fumeth thy wrath: agaynst thy sheepe, Of pasture (as we bee.) 18 Remember this (in mynd) O Lord: thyne enmies how they vaunt, How folishly: the people haue: reuylde thy name a taunt. 19 Geue not thy turtels (sely) soule: to beast of cruell port: Forget not aye: the company: of thyne afflicted sort. 20 Behold thy pact: ones made (to vs) for darkenes pestilent: Is spred the earth: where theeues do dwell: both false and violent. And yet art far from vs (O God) For euer wilt thou flee? Why fumeth thy wrath: agaynst thy sheepe, Of pasture (as we bee. 21 O suffer not the poore (that is) contryte to feele a shame: But let the poore: and nedy soule: for helpe aye prayse thy name. 22 Ryse God (awake) and iudge thy cause: thy foe thou seest extreme: Beare still in mynde: hys vyle attempt: for daily he blasphemth. 23 Forget not thou the (ragyng voyce) the brags of all thy foes: Theyr boasting pryde: do mount alway: at thee theyr hatred goes. O than be nye: O God (our God) For euer do not flee? And fume no more: agaynst thy sheepe, Of pasture (as we bee.) Psalme. LXXVI. The Argument. A prophecy: of Christ ye spye, who threath the wycked state: Not so to wry: their tiranny, to wreke poore men in hate. Confitebimur tibi Deus. 1 We do confesse: and thankes expresse, to thee O God wyth prayse: Thy name is nye: as testifie, thy wondrous workes alwayes. 2 When tyme most fit: shall serue to it, I then will iudge the ryght: In day so set: when men be met, all hartes to sprede in sight. 3 Proud earthly man: shall melt euen than, who dwelleth on earth shall quaile: I set the ground: of earth so round, I can it shake no fayle. Sela. 4 I did vpbrayd: such fooles and sayd, deale not so madly sirs: To wycked rout: I spake full out, blow not your horne to fierce. 5 Lift not to hie: your horne sayd I, your power all wrong ensuth: Wyth stubburn neckes: speake you no checks but bend your hartes to truth. 6 For hye renowne: commeth not adowne, from East, or West, or South: How wyde ye bee: ye cannot flee, this Gods true worde of mouth. 7 For God iwis: right domes man is, no thought can scape his eyes: Hym throweth he downe: hym doth he crown as he can best deuise. 8 In Gods ryght hand: a cup theyr standth, of wyne full red to see: But mixt wyth lies: and dregs it lighes, which he poorth diuersly. The good at brynke: the cleare doth drynke, God brinche them gently so: The bad doth sup: the dregs full vp, the botomes troublous wo. 9 Still will I talke: such wonted walke, of Iacobs God and Lord: His doomes to sing: hym worshippyng, I will wyth hartes accord. 10 And God sayth thus: downe will I crushe, all hornes of wycked men: Euen so will I: exalt on hye, all ryghteous power agayne. Psalme. LXXVI. The Argument. Against oppressours tyrannous, who put Gods flocke to wrong: This Psalme would they: should well discusse, Gods power and hand so strong. Nota in Iudea deus 1 In Iury God: is known full well, the ryghteous doth confesse: His name is great: in Israell, the wycked sayth no lesse. 2 His tabernacle: Salem is, a place of peace most sweete: And Syon hill: a seat of his, where raignth hys grace full meete. 3 This God euen there: for all theyr sake, his loue so them behelde: Bowe, arrowes, sword: and shield he brake, all battayle set in field. Sela. 4 Thou Syon mount: doost more excell, in honor fame and myght: Then robbers hils: where that they dwell, how fierce they range in sight. 5 These Gyantes proud: of stomacke fell, euen they be spoylde agayne: They slept theyr sleepe: though full they swell, theyr handes shall nought retayne. 6 O Iacobs God: at thy reproofe, these tyrantes fell to ground: Theyr charets splayd: and strayed aloofe, both horse and man I drownd. 7 Euen thou alone: thou fearefull art, in wrath agaynst the proud: Who can resist: thyne irefull dart, O Lord who euer could? 8 From heuen thou madest: thy iudgement so?d that earth thy power myght heare: So earthly man: was soone on ground, he shooke and quayld for feare. 9 When God arose: to iudge in ryght, hys sayntes opprest wyth smart: Then dyd hys strength: appeare in sight, to saue the meke in hart. Sela 10 Mans fiercenes past: shall full set out, thy prayse (O Lord) no lesse: Their traynes &amp; guiles: which stil they clout, from hence thou shalt represse. 11 Then vow your vowes: and pay them well, to your Lord God full glad: I byd you all: which nye hym dwell, bryng giftes to God so drad. 12 Stout Princes sprites: so furious, he can both quenche and quell: On them his hand: is wonderous, how fierce in earth they swell. Psalme. LXXVII. The Argument. Strong fayth in voyce: with diligence, for helpe he cryeth a lowd: He stickth to Gods: good prouidence, and seeth himselfe alowd. Voce mea ad Dominum. 1 To God to cry: in voyce I will, to God I say in voyce: He shall to me: geue eare full still, to make my hart reioyce. 2 In troublous dayes: the Lord I sought, my woundes still ranne by night: My handes and strength ful low were brought my soule fled comfort quyte. 3 I will of God: yet mindfull be, to wayle I wyll not cease: Whan I my soule: sore vext shall see, my voyce shall not decrease. Sela 4 Thou holdst myne eyes: full waking still, that rest I none can take: So faynt and weake: I haue no wil, once speche by mouth to make. 5 I did therfore: than strayt recownt, the dayes of olde ferne yeares: I did reuolue: the fathers wont, in their distresse and feares. 6 My songs from mynde: shall not depart, to others which I sing: By night I muse: and talke in hart, my sprite searcht euery thinge. 7 And thus I playne: wyll God my Lord, absent himselfe for aye? Shal I be thus: so sore abhorde, will he his grace denay? 8 Hys pytye great: will it a waye: for euer not to tourne: And will his worde: now ende (I saye) to make vs still to mourne? 9 Hath God forgot: to pytye thus? can he himselfe forget? And will he shut: so hard from vs, his loues and mercyes great. Sela. 10 At last I sayd: this wauering, declareth my frayltye fonde: But I entend: in mynd to bryng, the chaunge of his good hande. 11 My Lords great actes: I will recount, my fayth to hym to bynde: His wondrous workes: how hye they mount, In tymes of olde to fynde. 12 In all thy workes: so wrought by thee, my study whole shall stand: My talke shalbe: most frankly free, to spreade thy dedes of hand. 13 Thy way O God: I see is set, in holynes all bryght: What God is like: in glory great, as this our God of might? 14 Thou God art he: which openly, workst wonders hye as God: To people farre: and sonderly, thy power thou spredst abroade. 15 Thou hast redeemd: with might in deede, thy people tenderly: Olde Iacobs stocke: and Iosephes seede, escapt by thee they be. 16 The waters deepe: saw thee O God, the waters deepe saw thee: They were afrayd: to feele thy rod, the depthes dyd quake to see. 17 Thy cloudes raynd down: so waters fell, the heauens for sound dyd ryng: The stones of hayle: were arrowes fell, by them thy foes to wryng. 18 Thy thunders noyse: dyd rumble stout, in ayre the sphere aboue: Thy lightnyngs shoone: all round about, the earth dyd quake and moue. 19 Thy way in sea: is large and wyde, thy pathes in waters great: Thy footesteps yet: cannot be spied, how there thy feete be set. 20 Thou ledst thy people pastor like, as sheepe in all theyr way: By Moses hand: thou didst them keepe, whom Aaron helpt to stay. Psalme. LXXVIII. The Argument. This hye profound: oration, A monitorie is: To God to turne: to trust vpon, by workes so great of his. Attendite populi meus. 1 My people kinde: heare this my law, true lore it full auowth: Inclyne your eare: in gentle awe, to harke my wordes of mouth. 2 My lipes sage sawes: shall now vnfolde, which parables might seeme: And prouerbes straunge: of yeares of olde, how we should God esteeme. 3 Which thinges we haue: both hard and tride, to be most certen true: Which fathers olde: to vs a lyed, vs tolde that should ensue. 4 Not we therfore: will hyde the same, from their posterytye: To them to tell: Gods lauds and fame, his wonders straunge to see. 5 He made a pact: with Iacob iust, and law set Israell: Wherin he chargd: our fathers trust, these things their seede to tell. 6 That so myght all theyr linage know, in ages still to come: To ryse and sprede: to hye and low, Gods actes to his renome. 7 That they therby: myght truly set, in God affiaunce strong: That they should not: hys workes forget, but kepe his hestes full long. 8 Lest they should proue: theyr fathers lyke, a faythles stubburne kynde: A people loth: the ryght to seke, which fell from God in mynde. 9 All lyke the tribe: of Ephraym, in armes wyth dartes and bowes: Yet turnd theyr backes: at fightyng tyme, and had foule ouerthrowes. 10 They kept not (lo) true tutch wyth God, hys pact they oueryed: From hys sweete hestes: they strayd abrode, to walke hys law they fled. 11 And soone forgate: what done had he, to them as beastes vnkynd: His wondrous workes: that they had seene, were cleane cast out of mynd. 12 Great meruels wrought: his mighty hand, in theyr forefathers sight: At Zoan field: in Egipt land, to shew hys power and might. 13 He cut the seas: apart to stand, as walles erect on hye: He led them through: to go to land, while they like heapes did lygh. 14 He led them forth: in Iorneys right, by clowde as guyde by day: By night whole out: in firy lyght, his angels kept their way. 15 He claue the rockes: in wildernes, how hard so euer growne: Where out he slackt: theyr thirstines, as flouds from depthes had flowne. 16 He made the stone: to gushe in streams, from them did water strike: Though flyntes by kynd: kepe fiery leames, God made them drinke to kepe. 17 For all this yet: agaynst his will, they sinned more and more: They hym prouokt: in desert still, for all his gentle store. 18 They tempted God: to proue hys power, theyr hartes went much astray: They would haue meat: at present hower, theyr lustes they would assay. 19 Agaynst theyr God: most euery where, they spake lyke rebels thus: Can God prouide: a table here, in wyldernes for vs? 20 He strake the rocke: the waters spred, as streames they flowed in deede: But can (say they): God geue vs bread, or flesh hys flocke to feede? 21 When God this heard: he was full wroth, his fyre in Iacob brent: Hys heauy plage: in anger goeth, euen downe on Israell sent. 22 Because no hope: in God they layde, that he could feede theyr want: Nor yet put trust: in hym for ayde, God made theyr hartes to pant. 23 He dyd commaund: the cloudes aboue, which flote the ayre about: He bade the heauens: theyr gates remoue, to poure theyr giftes full out. 24 Then rayned downe: that Manna sweete, therof that they should tast: He sent them down: about theyr feete, from heauen thys vyand cast. 25 O wondrous act: that man dyd eate, such foode of aungels strong: He pourd them down: theyr fill of meate, their pitched tentes among. 26 He made the East: wynd blow hys blast, amid the heauen in length: He forst the southwynde blow as fast, by hys great power and strength. 27 So than he raynd: as thicke as dust, of flesh aboundant store: And fetherd foules: to fill theyr lust, as thicke as sand on shore. 28 Amid theyr tentes: it fell as motes, not far to seeke therfore: Euen round about: theyr dwellyng cotes, it dyd them serue the more. 29 They thus dyd eate: and fed they were, full vp vnto the chin: He graunted them: theyr lust so far, what they could wishe therin. 30 Theyr lust was not: abased so, for still in lust they quothed: And whyle they chowd: both to and fro, in mouth this meat they lothed. 31 Lo wrath from God: was kyndled then, he slew theyr worthies great: He feld to ground: theyr chosen men, in Israell beset. 32 For all this yet: they sinned still, theyr wonted guise they playde: To trust to hym: they had no will, though wonders he displayde. 33 Therfore he spoyld: theyr lyuyng dayes, in vanitie to lygh: Theyr yeares he spent: in feares and frayes, to vexe both hart and eye. 34 As long as God: them strake and slue, they sought hym then full gent: They seemed tho: theyr sinnes to rue, to God at morne they went. 35 Then could they well: remember this, that God was all their strength: That God full good: redemer is, theyr comfort most at length. 36 But yet they dyd: but glose in speache, theyr hartes agreed not so: They lyed in tonge: thus hym to seache, dissemblers dyd they go. 37 Theyr myndes to hym: were nothing sound, but hollow hartes they had: They stoode not still: wyth hym so bound, in league and couenaunt glad. 38 Yet he so good: theyr sinnes forget, and would not them despise: Full oft: hys wrath: he dyd retrete, that whole it should not ryse. 39 For he dyd count: they were but flesh, as frayle as britle glasse: And that they were: like wynde to gesse, that passth wythout repasse. 40 Ryght many tymes: in wildernes, they hym prouoked sore: How much grieued they: his gentlenes, in desert more and more. 41 They dyd reuolte: oft God to tempt, that saint of Israell: They proued hys power: in mad contempt, as he in boundes should dwell. 42 They minded not: hys able hand, what once for them it wrought: Nor yet that day: when they were bond, how he redemption brought. 43 How he had done: miraculously, in Egipt fully out: In Zoan field: his wonders hye, they dyd forget no dout. 44 When he did turne theyr waters sweete, to bloud how they increast: And made theyr springes: all full on meete, for drinke for man or beast. 45 He lyce sent eke: all kynd of flies, which them deuoured quyte: Among them frogs: dyd scraule and ryse, to vexe them day and nyght. 46 He gaue theyr fruites: of whole encrease, to caterpillers spoyle: The grashopper: dyd neuer cease, to wast theyr labours toyle. 47 He dyd vnbarke: of vyne the trees, wyth stones in clods congeald: And eke theyr trees: of mulberies, wyth frostes so sene but selde. 48 He smote their beastes: of cart and plough, wyth hayle in his great ire: Their other flockes: he smoote full rough, wyth coales of burnyng fire. 49 He cast on them: his fury whote, wrath, woo, with anguyshe styng: With such fel plages: them sore he smote which Angels euyll do bring. 50 He made playn waye: for his sore wrath to go, and stroyd them quyte: No sowle he sparde: from sodaine death, their beasts the plage dyd smyte. 51 He stroyd theyr fruites: begotten fyrst In Egypt furious: Their prymer fruts: of all their lust where Chams seede dwelt in house. 52 But yet he led: his people free, lyke shepe he kept them aye: As shepe in flocke: most tenderly in desert led their waye. 53 He brought them out: in suertye all feares that they might flee: He ouerwhelmd: their foes at eye, In waues of fomyng sea. 54 He brought them iust: within the cost of his good Sanctuary: To this swete hyl: of vertue most which hys right hand dyd bye. 56 He Paynyms draue: all out of place, and Iacobs stocke put in: Theyr heritage: he set the space, and met theyr lot by lyne. 57 But yet the Lord: they tempted hie, and hym prouoked still: They turned quite: his law awry, the signes of hys good wyll. 58 They turnd theyr backes: yea did conspire, as once theyr fathers went: To theyr old wontes: they dyd retyre, as sturdy bow in bent. 59 To reare hill aulters was theyr trade, wherby they moued hym sore: Of Idols grauen: theyr Gods they made, by which they greued him more. 60 God heard thys case: full wroth was he, wyth indignation great: At Israell: excedingly, hys sore displeasure fret. 61 That he did shoone: hys sacrary, which once in Sylo stoode: Hys tent I say: pitchd stedfastly, among olde Adams bloud. 61 So he eftsones: to thraldom sent, hys arke that was theyr strength: Which was theyr olde: fayre ornament, their foes possest at length. 62 His folke he gaue: vnto the sword, wyth warres entangled so: Hys heritage: full sore he deard, in much displeasant wo. 63 The fire eate vp: theyr lusty men both yong in armes and sydes: Theyr virgins yong: not honord then, wyth wedlocke songes as brides. 64 Theyr priestes by sword: were vily slayne, religion set at nought: No wydowes left: which should complayne, before all slayne by thought. 65 The Lord as one: layd long in slepe, at length from slepe awoke: Wyth wyne refresht: in hart full depe, as gyaunt strength he toke. 66 Hys foes rearwardes: euen down he felde, theyr hynder partes he strake: That most in shame: they euer dweld, so he theyr armies brake. 67 All Iosephs trybe: he dyd refuse hys arke to them to bryng: So Ephraym: he would not vse, he ment an other thyng. 68 But Iudas trybe: he toke hym till, wherin he bode in place: And olde beloued: sweete Zyon hyll, he chase in louely grace. 69 And there he built: hys sanctuary, as princely palace hye: He founded it: as earth to lygh in state perpetually. 70 And Dauid meke: he dyd elect, hys seruaunt whom he loued: To state so hye: from state abiect, from shepe cotes hym remoued. 71 He toke them vp: in followyng, hys ewes full big wyth yong: To guide hys folke: in pasturyng, hys heyres of Iacob sprong. 72 And he them fed: in faythfull hart, as Christ annoynted kyng: He gouernd them: in prudent part, hys raygne all blisse dyd spring. Psalme. LXXIX. The Argument. The church lamenth: the tyranny, of all her foes so fell: Her sinnes she waylth: most mourningly, yet trust of helpe full well. Deus vene runt gentes. 1 O God now come: be Paynyms wylde, thyne heritance to wast: Thy holy house: they haue defylde, Hierusalem is raced. 2 Thy seruaunts corps: this heathen sect, hath cast to byrdes for meate: Thy sayntes weake flesh: they haue reiect, to beastes of earth to eate. 3 Theyr bloud they haue: lyke water shed, about Hierusalem: And none there was: to mourne the dead, or yet to bury them. 4 We are become: an open shame, to all our neyghbours next: But mockyng stockes: in laughyng game, on all sides we be vext. 5 O Lord how long: shall last thyne ire? for euer shall it bee? Thy gelousie: to burne as fyre, for euer shall we see? 6 Poure out thy wrath: vpon thy foes, for Paynyms know not thee: Upon those realmes: which be to lose, thy name and power to see. 7 Deuourd they haue: true Iacobs place, hys seede and house lygheth wast: The sanctuary: of thy good grace, the walles they haue defaced. 8 Our former sinnes: remember not, make speede, shew mercy soone: Thou seest our griefe: our wofull state, how all we be vndone. 9 Helpe vs O God: our sauiour, for prayse of thy good name: Our sinnes our ill: behauiour, forgeue, forget the same. 10 Least heathen rayle: and say in spite, where now is come theyr God? Thy seruaunts bloud: so shed in sight, reuenge, and shew thy rod. 11 O heare the sighes: and sorowes deepe, of captiue men in bonds: Men iudgd to death: see that thou kepe, shewe forth thy strength of hands. 12 The blasphemy: at thee so cast, by these our neighbours partes: Requyte it them: O Lord at last, seuen solde on all theyr hartes. 13 So we thy shepe: and people true, to thankes we shall agree: Thy prayse our tonges: shall still ensue, to our posteritie. Psalme. LXXX. The Argument. This Psalme doth aske: deliuerance, from hard captiuitie: In peace and truth: good Christians, should pray Christes church to bee. Quiregis Israell. 1 Thou shepeheard king: of Israell, that Ioseph ledst as shepe: On Cherubin: that sittest so well, heare now, appeare, and kepe. 2 For Ephraym: and Beniamin, and eke Manasses sake: Stirre vp thy power: and strength of thyne, and vs to mercy take. 3 Restore vs God: to loue agayne, and shyne on vs thy face: If thou Lord wylt: vs visite playne, we shall be safe by grace. 4 Thou Lord and God: of hostes I say, how long shall fret thyne ire? Agaynst thy folke: which daily pray, to thee in meeke desyre. 5 Thou feedst them full: wyth bread of teares, they mourne for wo at meat: Thou geuest them drinke: in weping feares, in heaped measure great. 6 A cause of stryfe: thou makest vs be, to all our neyghbours next: They rayle on vs: and scornd be we, our foes vs sore haue vext. 7 Turne vs to thee: thou God of hostes, and shyne thy face on vs: Kepe vs in peace: represse theyr bostes, and whole we shalbe thus. 8 Thou didst translate: from Egipt darke, a vyne euen so thou wouldst: To plant it there: it was thy warke, whence Paynyms were expulst. 9 Thou madest it rome: first clensd by hand, from Cananites the weedes: And roote it toke: it spred the land, these were thy godly deedes. 10 The hyls were closde: wyth shade of it, the hyll of Syon house: The boughes thereof: dyd sprede so fit, lyke Ceders glorious. 11 She did extend: her braunches wyde, to touch the seas extremes: In length it went: a long the syde, of Euphrates the streames. 12 Why hast thou beat: his closure downe, to lay as open soyle? That they which walke: from towne to towne her grapes myght freely spoyle. 13 The tushy bore: of woode full fierce, doth route it vp to stoure: A sauage beast: whose meat is gyrse, doth wholy it deuoure. 14 Turne thee we praye: thou God of hosts, looke down from heauen in speede: Beholde this vine: in all our costes, and visite it at neede. 15 The vyneyard place: behold also, which thy right hand did set: For thy sonnes sake: defend therto, the braunch thou madst so great. 16 With fyer brent: it is cut downe, thy wrath was cause in sight: But they shal quayle: (when thou doost frown) which wrought this dedly spite. 17 Extend thy hand: vpon the man, of thy right mighty hand: Upon the sonne: of man that can, thy foes by strength withstand. 18 And so shall we: no more receede, from thee so wyde to fall: Yf thou reuiuest: vs than in deede, thy name extoll we shall. 19 O Lord our God: turne vs agayne, from erryng far from thee: Shew vs thy light: of face so fayne, all whole then shall we bee. Psalme. LXXXI. The Argument. A song of ioy to God: of maiestie aboue, Who geueth all thing aboundantly: to th? that him do loue. Exultate. 1 Now sing ye ioyfully: To God our strength &amp; rocke: Yea sing ye swete: in iubilies: to God of Iacobs stock 2 Streyne vp your psaltery: and wrest your tymbrels hye, Wyth mery harpe: and virginals: set out your melodye. 3 Blow out wyth trumpet lowde: in new mooues feast I say: In tyme so meete: accordingly: our solempne feastfull day. 4 By statute thus enact: it is for Israell: From Iacobs God: it is a law: hys worthy actes to tell. 5 God made in Iosephes seede: (for wytnes) thys decree: Of Egipt land: wh? out he went: where language straunge hard he. 6 I did his shulder ease: from burthens great and thicke: His hands escapte: the dayly toyle: of making potts and bricke, 7 Thou cryedst on me in stresse: I thee deliuered ryfe: In thunder close: I answerd thee: first tried at sluds of strife Sela. 8 O then my people heare: I wyll the iust assure: O Israell: if heare thou wylt: my worde which shall endure. 9 Strange God thou shalt not haue: no other God to serue: If thys thou doost: and frowardly: fro me thou doost not swerue. 10 I am the Lord thy God: who thee from Egypt led: Then set thy mouth: full open wyde: I wyll it fyll full fed. 11 But yet my people thus: would neuer heare my voyce, No Israell: would none of me: nor lyst in me reioyce. 12 I let them go therfore: theyr own hartes lustes to sue: Theyr crooked wayes: to walke at will: whych they did after rue. 13 O that my people meke: had heard my document: And Israell: had walkt my wayes: wyth gentle hartes assent. 14 How soone would I at ones: their foes haue wrested downe: And turnd my hand: agaynst them all: at them who firse did frown 15 Gods haters should haue kneeld: at heeles of them to lay: Though lyingly: they had it ment: theyr dayes had lastd for aye. 16 Yea then he would haue fed: wyth floure of finest wheate: And out of rocke: them had I fild: wyth hony pleasant meat. Psalme. LXXXII. The Argument. This Psalme is thret: and lesson good, to iudges stately romes: Amid the Iewes: as Christ he stoode, and blamde their wrongfull domes. Deus stetit in Synagoga. 1 God standth in mids: of Princes hye, when they to counsayle fall: And iudge he is: theyr dedes to try, he iudgeth theyr iudgements all. 2 He once shall say: how long wyll ye, geue sentence wrongfully: How long wyll ye: acceptours be, of persons wickedly. Sela. 3 Defend the poore: and fatherles, speake law to theyr behoue: Of men afflict: in heauines, in ryght theyr cause approue. 4 The nedies sute: ryd ye hys cause, deliuer hym wyth spede: And plucke the poore: from all the clawes, of wycked bribers drede. 5 They nothyng know: nor vnderstand, they walke in darkenes depe: The bases reele: of all the land, for ryght, men mourne and wepe. 6 I sayd no lesse: but Gods ye bee, so hye I you esteemd: Of God most hye: as childern free, I you in office deemde. 7 But ye shall dye: as wretched men, to children most vnlike: To tyrauntes lyke: as one of them, ye all shall fall in dyke. 8 Ryse thou O God: iudge thou the land, where wronge hath such excesse: To heritage: thy mighty hand, shall clayme all heathennes. Psalme. Lxxxiij. The Argument. The Hebrues here: do inuocate, Their God for helpe: against mens spite: The church this psalme: doth renouate, In her distresse: to scape all quite. Deus quis similis. 1 O God our God: within thy selfe, Hold not thy tonge: thys muet still: Nor silence kepe: but kepe our helth, Stay not O God: but punishe euill. 2 For lo thou seest: what murmuryng, Thyne enmies make: most arrogant: How hye aloft: theyr heds they bryng, Who thee do hate: how proud they vaunt. 3 They haue in guyle: their counsayles take, in Ire agaynst: thy people poore: Conspirde they be: close drifts they make, and all thy sayntes: they will deuoure. 4 They sayd come on: let vs them roote, euen quyte from out: all nations: Of Israell: the name to wroote, no man to be: to name them once. 5 For they haue layd: their heades in one, together knit: in hart and mynde: Confederat: they be echone, agaynst thy selfe: like beastes vnkinde. 6 The tents where kepe: the Edomits, the Ismalits: with might and mayne: With them be ioynd: the Moabits, the Agareus: they fume agayne. 7 So Geball folke: and Ammon to, beset in leage: with Amaleke: The Palestyns: with them do go, and they that dwell: in Tyrus eke, 8 To them be knyt: thassirians, a people fierce: and strong in armes: Lothes childer hye: they would aduaunce, whose str?gth they be: to worke their harms. Sela 9 But do to them: as Madian, did feele thy hand: and angry looke: As eke thou didst: to Siseran, to Iabyn eke: at Kyson broke. 10 They whole on heapes: at Endor quaylde, no graue receyued: their bodyes deade: Gods hand them all: so countervaylde, as dunge on earth: their carcase spred. 11 Make them withall: their princes gaye, to Oreb like: and Zeb also: As Zebee: and Salmana: make all their peeres like them to go. 12 Who sayd in pride: let vs possesse, Gods temple hye: to vs to ryse: Let vs deface: that holynes, with all the rites: and sacrifice. 13 Make them my God: to be in sight, all like the whele: down hill that slidth: And let them be: as stuble light, tost hye wyth wynde: that neuer bidth. 14 And lyke as fyre: that brenth the woode, the rage wherof: no tree can flee: As flames the hyls: where forage stode, do wast for heate: and parched be. 15 Euen so O God: all them pursue, with thy great stormes: and tempests stoure In thy sore wrath: make them to rue, all foule dismayde: in hart to loure. 16 With vyle reprofe: their faces fyll, with very shame: confound them all: That they might search: thy name and wyll, O Lord to thee: that they might fall. 17 Be they abasht: and vexed still, Yea more and more: both day and nyght: And let theyr fames: all shame bespill, Destroy theyr flesh: but saue theyr sprite. 18 That they may know: that thou alone, Whose name deuine: Iehoua is: Art rocke most hye: against our foen, Aboue the earth: that sittest in blisse. Psalme. LXXXXIIII. The Argument. As Dauid longd: Gods house to walke: where ciuill warres hym drew: So should we loue: Christes church in sprite: hys heauenly face to vew. Quam dilecta. 1 O God of hostes: how louely be: thy tabernacles all? where god y? raignst in grace &amp; truth: for help at nede to call. 2 My soule doth bren: in loue it melth: it longth Gods courtes to see: My hart and flesh: doth pant and cry: wyth God of lyfe to bee. 3 Yea there her nest: the sparow buildth: the swalow there may bred: Thine altars nye: Lord God &amp; kyng: where wandring wars I led. 4 O wel is th?: their harts be blest: who may thy house frequ?t They may sing out: thy laudes always to ioy in mind cont?t Sela. 5 O happy men: whose helpe thou art: whose harts thy paths do seke Whose soules inspired: do ioy to walke: thy wayes in cred?ce meke 6 They passyng here: thys vale of teares: yet wels of ioy they finde: Theyr pooles at ful: w? heauenly showers: shal flow for rest of minde 7 Fr? strength to strength: from faith to faith: to god they shal go still, Till they by flockes: eche one appeare: wyth God in Syon hill. 8 O Lord of hostes: &amp; god of strength: heare y? my harts request With open eare: O harken God: on whom doth Iacob rest. Sela. 9 Behold O God: protectour good: our state in all assayes: Behold thy Christes: annoynted face: for grace thy people prayes. 10 In thy good courtes: one day passth more: then thousand daies els where I rather wish: gods dore to kepe: then proud mens halles to teare. 11 For God the Lord: is light and shield: he glory giueth and grace: No good thyng he: shall hold from them: who godly lyfe embrace. 12 O Lord of hostes: O puissant God: I must conclude for ryght: That man is blest: and blest agayne: who trustth in thy great might Psalme. LXXXV. The Argument. Man here makth sute: for sinne who felt, Deserued captiuitie: And shewth what helth: Christs kingdom delt, To mans felicitie. Benedixisti domine. 1 Agaynst thy land: become thou art, O Lord most gracious: thou hast returnd: fr?

Sela 3 Thou hast restraynd: thine heate all quyte, from indignation: Thou hast withdrawn: thy face and sight, from wraths destruction. 4 Whole turne vs than: O God our wealth, to grace that we conuert: Remoue thine ire: impart thy health, forgeue our foule desert. 5 Eternall God: agaynst vs thus, for euer wilt thou threate? Shalt thou thyne ire: stretch out to vs, from age to age so great? 6 Uphold thy worde: to vs returne, and quicken vs agayne: So shall thy flocke: no longer mourne, but ioy in thee full fayne. 7 Shew vs thy grace: O Lord of power, that it we may perceyue: And geue to vs: thy sauiour, that health we myght receyue. 8 Plaine wyll I heare: what God shall speake, for peace he shall denounce: To all hys folke: and louers eke, that they their vyce renounce. 9 All they no doubt: who will hym feare, is hys saluation nye: Hys glory than: shall iust appeare, in all our land at eye. 10 Ryght frendlines: and veritie, they shall ech others meete: So ryghteousnes: and peace from hye, shall kisse eche other sweete. 11 Known truth from earth: shal then out spring wyth all good fruites aryght: For ryghteousnes: all florishyng, from heauen shall cast her sight. 12 Euen thus the Lord: shall manifest, hys bounteous goodnes neare: That full our land: wyth grace possest, all godly frutes shall beare. 13 Ryght iustice eke: shall be hys guide, that strait may good man walke: His wayes and gate: her steps shall stryde, no tyme the ryght to balke.

In comfort free. Psalme. LXXXVII. The Argument. This pleasant song: describeth the state, Of Christs dere spouse: where Christ was borne Hierusalem: most fortunate, To nurse both Iewe: and gentile lorne. Fundamen ta eius in. 1 God hily loueth: Hierusalem, Whose bases strong: be depely set, In holy mountes: sure layd in them, Moria, Syon, Olyuet. 2 The Lord I say: loueth Syon gates, Her portes and fortes: her wals and towers: Aboue the rest: for all theyr states, Of Iacobs tentes: and princely bowers. 3 Thou citie hye: of God no doubt, Where he doth raigne: in maiestie: Hye thynges be sayd: to set thee out, To blase thy power: and dignitie. Sela. 4 I Raabs realme: and Babylons, Wyll beare in mynd: such shall know me Lo Tyrus lo: Philistians, Lo Moores most far: there borne is he. 5 Of Syon thus: it shall be sayd, That he and he: was borne in her: But he that is: far hyest layd, Is he that her: confirmth most clere. 6 The Lord for truth: shall it record, The people when: he registreth: That he so hye: that louely Lord, Was borne euen there: and there he lyegth. Sela. 7 All singers there: and trumpetters, Their songes &amp; hymnes: shall swete rebound: Fresh liuely springes: wyth all their cheres, Shall prayse thys Lord: for grace most bound. Psalme. LXXXVIII. The Argument. Here is a mone: most piteous, of man afflicte in stresse: It payntes Christes death: most dolorous, hys sepulture in flesh. Domine Deus. 1 My louyng Lord: and God of grace, on whom my health dependth: Both day and night: before thy face, my crye I haue extend. 2 O let therfore: my prayer soone come now before thy sight: Inclyne thyne eare: and heare my bone, with teares which I endight. 3 My soule is full: of miseries, in woes full gorgd I rore: My lyfe in sight: to all mens eyes, is euen at death hys dore. 4 As one of them: I am esteemd, that tumble must in pit: A sely man: I am but deemd, so voyde of strength I sit. 5 As free (from toyle) among the dead, as wounded slepe in graue: Who far from mynd: be sonke as lead, whom slayne thy handes now haue. 6 In pit most deepe: thou hast me throwne, in deathes and hels dispayre, In places darke: down low bestown, where commth no lyght nor ayre. 7 Thy fury Lord: lyeth hard on me, oh stiffe on euery side: And vext thou hast: both hart and eye, wyth all thy stormes full tryde. Sela. 8 Thou hast driuen far: my frendes from me, acquaynted most to see: Abhord of them: thou madest me be, thus bound I cannot flee. 9 My sight doth fayle: for heauines, to thee Lord yet I cry: No day from thee: Lord would I cease, to lift my handes full hye. 10 Thy meruels great: wylt thou deuise, to worke to buried men? Or els shall sprites: to lyfe aryse, thy laudes to sound agayne? Sela. 11 Or shall my graue: thy pitie tell, when once thou hast me slayne? Or shall thy truth: be proued so well, when I destroyd am layne? 12 Thy wondrous workes: which wrought thy hand, Shall darkenes them expresse? Or shall thy iustice shyne in land, of mere forgetfulnes? 13 To thee O Lord: my prayer went, to whom els should I go? Yea still my sute: shall thee preuent, at morne while lastth my wo. 14 Why than O Lord: abhorst my soule, all helpe from me to wynde? Why hidest thy face: from me so whole, that I no grace can fynde? 15 Afflict I am: at poynt to dye, from youth thus haue I bene: In hart astound: thy dreades fele I, so fearefull they be sene. 16 Thy sower wrathes: so multiplied, hane ouerwhelmed me: Thy terrours eke: which sore abyde, haue stroyd me whole to see. 17 They daily did: passe ouer me, as water surges hye: They compasd me: in certenty, euen round about full nye. 18 Both frend and kinne: from me full far, thou hast put whole away: My frendes that were: familiar, in darke fro me they stray. Psalme. LXXXIX. The Argument. The letter here: describeth to eare, the state of Dauids raygne: The sprite to hart: doth this impart, that Christ shall aye remayne. Misericordias domine. 1 Gods mercies all: wyth song I shall, for euer sing and play: Wyth mouth euen still: expresse I will hys truth from day to day. 2 For thus I sayd: hys mercy stayde, for euer shall remayne: Thou shalt confirme: thy truth most firme, in heauen and it maintayne. 3 With Abraham: in league I am, who was my chief elect: To Dauid lo: I sware euen so, for hym and all his sect. 4 I will thy sede: prepare in dede, for euer world to ende: I will aduaunce: thy gouernaunce, for aye thy raigne extende. Sela 5 The heauens O Lord: shall iust recorde, thy meruayles great in dede: Euen so thy saintes: wythout restraintes, thy truth in church shall sprede. 6 For who compare: so boldly dare, with God in heauen so cleare? Whom can we seke: the Lord so like, among Gods children deare. 7 This God of blisse: most puissant is, amids his saintes echone: Most louely feare: to hym they beare, which stand about his throne. 8 O Lord and God: of hostes so brode, who (Lord) so strong as thou? Euen round about: thy truth falth out, to them which thee allow. 9 Thou canst represse: the seas excesse, by power imperiall: When they do swell: in surges fell, thou makest them downe to fall. 10 Thou Egipt braidst: and it so raydst, as wounded carcasse proude: Thou scatredst wyde: thine enemies pride, such strength thyne arme auowde. 11 The heauens be thyne: wyth all their shyne, the earth is thine ful sure: The world so round: thou dydst it found, with all the furniture. 12 As North and South: stood thorow thy mouth thy worde them both dyd frame: So Tabor West: and Hermon East, both hils shall ioy thy name. 13 An arme endude: with fortitude, thou hast omnipotent: O let thyne hand: then strongly stand, thy ryght hand hie be bent. 14 As ryghteousnes: so iudgement is, thy throne and royall seat: With mercy truth: most ioyntly sueth, before thy face so swete. 15 O then most blest: such folke doth rest, that ioyeth and feelth the same: In thy pure light: they walke shall right, O Lord to prayse thy name. 16 Thy name so bright: shall them delite, all day to ioy therin: And they alwayes: themselfe shall rayse, by thy iust word to winne. 17 For thou thy selfe: doost worke their welth, the ioy of all theyr strength: By thy good grace: thou shalt in place, lyft vp our hornes at length. 18 On God is set: our helpe so great, our shield he is to tell: And be our kyng: all health to bryng, that saint of Israell. 19 Thou spakest thus once: in visions, to thy swete saintes full nye: My helpe I layd: to strong mens ayde, I chase and hauntst him hye. 20 I Dauid found: my seruant sound, I sacred hym wyth oyle: Hym kyng made I: ryght holily, and Lord of all the soyle. 21 Wyth hym my hand: shall strongly stand, my power shall hym defend: My valiant arme: shall whole hym arme, for strength I will him send. 22 No force so fyne: can vndermyne, hys strength to make him thrall: No crafty wyle: shall him beguile, by wycked man to fall. 23 I down will bray: his foes aray, which shall hys face resist: His haters lyke: I will them strike, and stroy them shall my fist. 24 My faythfulnes: and gentlenes, wyth hym shall long abyde: In my good name: shall spring his fame, hys horne and strength full wyde. 25 Unto the sea: his raigne shall be, and he the Lord of it: His right hand shall: rule ryuers all, on fluds as chiefe to sit. 26 He me full grate: shall inuocate, most frankly thus to say: My father thou: my Gods t'auow, my helth, my rocke, my stay. 27 Yea more then this: I wyll him blisse, my first begotten sonne: More hie to stand: then kings in land, that yet to earth be gone. 28 I will him kepe: my fauour meke, for euer hym to loue: My couenaunt fast: to hym so past, shall neuer voyde remoue. 29 His seede euen so: shall stable go, so depe I will it plant: His regall powers: shall days and howers, as heauen stand valiant. 30 But if his sede: from me recede, and shall my law forsake: Or yet shall balke: in all theyr walke my iudgemente them to slake. 31 And shall perchance: myne ordinance, prophane and cast it backe: Or my precept: as light reiect, to kepe it shall be slacke. 32 I wyll no doubt: then visite stout, to scourge theyr wyckednes: I wyll them smite: wyth plagues in sight, to beate their sinnefulnes. 33 Yet wyll not I: my clemency, wythdraw from them to go: And lowd to lye: so wyll not I, my fayth to ieopard so. 34 I list not vayne: my pact prophane, though they defile theyr south: I wyll me take: to that I spake, to kepe my word of mouth. 35 Once sware I dyd: and testified, my holines to pledge: From Dauids part: I would not start, as this may he alledge. 36 That is, his sede: should euer sprede, and neuer should decay: Hys throne begunne: should shyne as sunne, in my swete light to lay. 37 As moone in sight: it should be bryght, though oft it feelth the clips: These witnes sure: in heauen endure, to try my fayth of lips. Sela. 38 But lo as now: what done hast thou, thou hast abhord thy Christ: And hym forsakt: and abiect makt, at hym displeasd thou lighst. 39 Of couenant made: thou breakst the trade, wyth this thy seruant knit: His regall crowne: thou rentst it down, euen flat on earth to sit. 40 His walles as wast: thou battred hast, and none thou leauest to stand: Thou breakst hys fortes: &amp; stroyst his portes, thyne ire seemth now so grand. 41 All they to spy: which iorney by, tread downe hys raygne in spyte: The neyghbour next: hys state hath vext, as laughyng stocke in fight. 42 Who foes therto: in hatred go, theyr handes thou lyftes on hye: The enemy coye: thou makst him ioy, at it, hys iestes to wry. 43 Thou hast whole stynt: hys weapons dynt, hys edge of sword but blunt: It had no power: as conquerour, to wynne as it was wont. 44 Thus hys renowne: thou pulst a downe, wyth darkenes all obscurde: Hys scepter flat: on ground is plat, dispayre he seeth assurde. 45 Thou hast in deede: thus shortened, hys yong and flouryng dayes: Thou hast hym clad: wyth shame bestad, ashamed thus he layes. Sela 46 How long by day: wylt thou for aye, O Lord thus hyde thy face? And shall thyne ire: thus burne as fire, wylt thou thys raigne disgrace? 47 O call to mynde: in hart yet kynde, what brittle date I beare: Or hast thou wrought: mankynd for nought, to stroy hym thus in feare. 48 What man is hee: in lyfe so free, that death shall neuer see? Can he escape: hys mortall shape, from graue whole ryd to bee? Sela. 49 Where may we holde: thy mercies olde, O Lord, where do they lygh? As thou dydst sweare: in Dauids eare, in truth most earnestly. 50 Then call to mynde: spite done vnkynde, O Lord to thyne electes: What tauntes in brest: I hold at rest, of diuers peoples sectes. 51 Wherwyth thy foes: haue wrought vs woes, O Lord despitefully: They threat vs hye: opprobriously, no steps of Christ to spy. 52 We may conclude: though we be rude, the Lord will turne agayne: The Lord therfore: for euermore, be blest, Amen, Amen. The ende of the third booke. Here beginneth the fourth Booke of Psalmes. Psalme. XC. The Argument. The wofull lyfe: of man for sinne: here Moses paynted clere: Gods grace aduaunst: mans state deiect: Christes aduent craued here. Domine ne refugium. 1 O Lord thou hast: our refuge bene: as sanctuary most free: In tyme now past: fr? age to age: to wh? safe might we flee 2 Before the hils: had ful their shape: ere earth &amp; world was made: Frobar; world to world: true God y? art: thy power shal neuer fade. 3 Thou doost retract: mans life to dust: thou so dissoluest his trayne: And saist eftsoones: ye Adams seede: returne to lyfe agayne. 4 A thousand yeres: in thy good sight: as yesterday that was: though long they seme: yet swift thy slide: as nightly watch doth pas. 5 Thou makest th? flow: as fluds in course: as dremes they vanish lyte As early grasse in sodentye: doth change hys hue and plight. 6 Which flourth at morne: &amp; groeth ful grene: &amp; gatherth str?gth ful gay But rept it is: at nyght full dym: and witherth dry away. 7 Alike we wast: and fall away: when thou art wroth for sinne: And whyle thys sence: of wrath doth last: afrayd we be therin. 8 Thou hast detect: before thy face: our sinnes ful open layd: Our hydden crymes: our secrecies: thy face hath bright dewrayd. 9 For all our dayes: do slyde away: in thy displeasant wrath: We spend our yeres: as tale is told: that brittle pleasure hath. 10 Our yeres in dais: be seuenty selde: though str?gth wan eighty mo: That pride at last: were paine and griefe: it passe and hence we go. 11 Thy wrathfull power who can comprise? no man by reasonyng: for more y? m?: doth feare thy power: thy wrath him more doth wring 12 That we our days: may n?ber right: O teach this wit to vs: Theyr date so frayle: shal make our harts: apply to wisdome thus. 13 Be thou retournd: O Lord we pray: how long wylt thou depart: Thy seruantes rue: most pityfull: intreatable in hart. 14 Refresh vs Lord: and fill vs full: with thy swete early loue: To ioy a while: to sing the laudes: whyle we our breth can moue. 15 And cheare our hartes: wyth dayes as good: as thou hast vs afflict: And as our yeres: haue smarted long: with heauy scourges strickt. 16 Thy seruantes teach: thy worke deuine: theyr state thy grace to see: That thy renowne: may so appeare: to theyr posteritie. 17 The cherefull grace: of God our Lord: remayne on vs as now: Our workes of handes: confirme in vs: our handes O prosper thou Psalme. XCI. The Argument. The faythfull man: doth here confesse: that Gods defence is strong: Against all griefe: that hym can presse: to scape all wo and wrong. Qui habitat in adiutorio. 1 Who vnder fence: and couert dwelth, of God that is most hye: He shall be sure: in shadow well, By God of heauen to ligh. No dout of thys: ought man to haue: who proofe therof will make: For God is strong: vs all to saue: if fayth to hart we take. 2 The iust by fayth: may thus be bolde, to say to God so iust: Thou art my hope: my strength and holde, my God in whom I trust. I haue no hope: in worldly thyng: that may be sene or felt, Though things I vse: as nede doth bring: which god for vse hath delt 3 To make the scape: he will not misse, all crafty hunters snares: from pestilence: that noysome is, as far from other cares. When diuel or m?: hys soule wil spyte: then God wyl helpe hym free Hys body frayle: shal yet be quyte: from plages how fierce they bee. 4 For vnder wynge: he thee shall hyde, hys fethers thee to broode: Hys fayth and truth: shall fence thy side, as shield and buckler good. As once th'arke: theyr wynges so wyde: the Cherubins dyd splay: As vseth the henne: her byrdes to stryde: to kepe the kyte away. 5 Thou shalt not neede: to be adrad, for feares of all the nyght: No dart so sharpe: shall make thee sad, that flyeth by day in syght. No horrors fell: shall so preuayle: to make thy hart agast: Misfortune none: shall thee assayle: God wyll eye thee so fast. 6 Thou shalt escape: all pestilence, which walkth in darke to noye: Of sicknes sore: to haue defence, that hye at none doth stroye. No venome bayte: shal thee infect: by diuell or man be layd: For God to thee: shall it detect: by whom it shall be stayd. 7 Though thousandes fast: to murrein renne by thee that dwellers bee: On thy right hand: though thousandes ten, do fall: thou shalt be free. Thou nedest not feare: what fortune fall: to all the world beside: Thou shalt not stand: so casuall: for God shall be thy guyde. 8 Yea both thyne eyes: shall make thee see, how proud men shall decay: How faythles impes: shall scourged bee, for theyr desert I say. God shall his foes: tread vnder foote: who him &amp; his did hate: Theyr lies and brags: them shal not boote: with all their cruel state 9 For thou my God: myne onely trust, my hope thou art t'endure: Thou hast my soule: thus made full iust, thy helpe to haue ryght sure. Because thou hast: affiance had: in God who dwelth so hye: He shall kepe thee: from chances bad: and be thy sanctuary. 10 There shall no euill: so chance to thee, but all shall worke thy wealth: No plage shall nye: thy dwellyng bee, to stroy therof the health. Thou safe shalt dwell: protected well: by God, if hym thou fearst: From wrathfull men: that be so fell: if fayth to God thou bearst. 11 For he shall geue: hys angels charge, on thee to cast theyr sight: To see thy wayes: full set at large, to walke therin aryght. Hys angels be thy seruantes prest: thy welth and helth to kepe: To worke thy rest: to prompt thy brest: thy God in hart to seke. 12 They shall in handes: beare thee alone, to stay thy hold aloft: Lest thou shouldst hurt: thy foote at stone, els mought thou fall full oft. If God thou fearst: &amp; kepe hys wayes: hys sprite wyll thee preserue Thou nedest no dout: to walke in strayes: if god thou vowst to serue 13 The Lyons fierce: and adder slye, on both them shalt thou go: Thou shalt tread down: the Lyons frye, and eke the dragon to. All venome beasts: shall renne fro thee: they shall serue thee at will The diuell so stoute: thy fayth shall flee: though he thy soule would spill. 14 Because hys hope: on me he set, I will hym rid from shame: I wyll hym lyft: to make hym great, because he knew my name. I will sayth God: my helpe hym send: in all hys troublous dayes: No better cause: make me to bend: then that on me he stayes. 15 When he shall call: and sue to me, to hym I shall apply: I will wyth hym: in trouble be, and ryd hym gloriously. His trust and fayth: shall not decay: hys loue shall haue reward. Though here he wepe: from day to day: yet I hys teares regard. 16 Wyth length of dayes: where lyfe shall last I wyll hym satisfy: I wyll hym shew: for louyng tast, my sauyng helth so hye. Though here opprest: as vyle outcast: the iust for ryght doth wayle: The greater ioy: sayth God at last: shall chance to hys aduayle. Who vnder fence: and couert dwelth, of God that is most hye: He shall be sure: in shadow well, by God of heauen to ligh. Psalme. XCII. The Argument. Of sabboth day (the solemne) feast: doth vs excyte by rest: Gods mighty workes: that we declare: loue hym for all the best. Bonum est confiteri. 1 A ioyfull thyng (to man) it is: the Lord to celebrate: To thy good name: O God so hye: due laudes to modulate. 2 To preach (and shew) thy gentlenes: in early mornyng lyght, Thy truth of worde: to testifie: all whole by length of nyght. 3 Upon (the psalme:) the decachord: vpon the pleasant lute: On sounding good: sweete instruments: w? shaumes, w? harpe, w? flute 4 For thou hast ioyed: my fearefull hart: O Lord thy workes to see And I with prayse: will iust reioyce: these handy workes of thee. 5 How glorious: O (blessed) Lord: be these the factes of thyne? Thy thoughts be depe: thy counsayles hye: inscrutable deuyne. 6 The brutish man: (that is) vntaught: is nought of this beseene: The foole as is: the carnall man? perceyueth not what it meanth. 7 When euill men flour: as (doth the) grasse: &amp; wicked workers bud Then shall they all: come downe at once: for euer drownd in mud. 8 But thou art hye: (full hye) aloft: as Lord and president: For euer standst: vnmoueable: and wyse in regiment. 9 For lo thy foes: O Lord (so strong:) thy foes shall perishe all: And such as worke: all wickedly: shall haue a shamefull fall. 10 My horne (and power) shall yet be raysd: as Unicornes is seene: Euen now I seme: as swetely dewd: with oyle of Oliue greene. 11 Myne eyes (full out) theyr lust shall haue: of all my waityng spyes: Myne eares the same: of crafty men: who vp at me dyd ryse. 12 The true (elect) and ryghteous man: shall florishe lyke the palme: As Ceder tree: in Lybanus: hymselfe shall sprede wyth balme. 13 Depe planted they (in rootes) alway: in gods swete house to byde: Shall florish lyke: in both the courtes: of this our God and guyde. 14 In age (most sure) they shall encrease: theyr fruite aboundantly: Well likyng they: and fat shalbe: to beare most fruitfully. 15 That is (to say) they out shall preach: this lordes true faythfulnes: Who is my strength: &amp; mighty rocke: who hateth vnryghteousnes Psalme. XCIII. The Argument. This praith in faith: when stormes aryse: in trust of helpe full sure: But here in raigne: is Christ bewrayde: and how his church shall dure. Dominus regnauit decorem. 1 The Lord is kyng: in hys aray: the Lord is clad wyth strength, He girt hymselfe: the world is sure: it cannot reele at length. 2 Thy throne is strong: prepared sure: from tyme all out of mynde Thou art that art: all durably: which neuer ende shalt fynde. 3 The flouds haue lift: aloft O Lord: the fluds haue lift their voyce: The stremes surge: wyth griesly waues: thy foes to hie reioyce. 4 But far aboue: all rage of fluds: or dreadfull stormes of sea: Doth God surmount: more excellent: hys enmies all to slea. 5 Thy worde is sure: thy testament: is tryed in all assayes: All holines: doth decke thy house: O Lord for yeares and dayes. Psalme. XCIIII. The Argument. The poore opprest: doth helpe implore, agaynst proud iudges myght: As Christ and hie: long heretofore, be paternes good in sight. Deus vltio num dominus. 1 O God and Lord: reuenger ryght, of sinne reuenger God: Now shew thy selfe: declare thy might, make hast to shake thy rod. 2 Be thou set vp: in maiesty, thou iudge of all the land: Requite the proud: accordingly, and let them feele thy hand. 3 How long O Lord: these wycked men, how long tryumphe shall they? Thy people thus: to ouer renne, wythout both stop and stay. 4 They blatter out: euen what they list, sore wordes they be and proude: All wycked ympes: wyll not desist, to vaunt and boast aloude. 5 Thy people Lord: full sore they slyte, thyne heritage they vexe: Their poore estates: wyth wronges they smyte and threates therto annexe. 6 The widow lo: the straunger eke, they murther craftely: The fatherlesse: they quell alyke, though deare to thee they ligh. 7 Theyr mouthes thus speake: as hartes deuise, tush God seeth nought of this: Nor Iacobs God: shall thys aduise, in thys he is remysse. 8 Ye doltes of all: most brute to see, betyme yet vnderstand: When prudent wise: when will ye bee? ye fooles I say so fond. 9 Can he be deafe: which made the eare, how harken should not hee? Who made the eye: can ye hym bleare? that he should nothyng see? 10 Or he that checkes: the heathen els, shall he not you reproue? And he that man: all wisdom tels, shall he not you remoue? 11 The Lord doth know: the thoughtes of man, to be both fond and vayne: Your open wronges: how can they than, escape deserued payne? 12 Then happy is: that man and blest, whom thou doost chastise here: And whom by loue: in law thou teachest, O blessed Lord most deare. 13 To make hym sit: wyth patience, in dreadfull dayes at rest: Whyle that to men: of violence, theyr pit be digd and drest. 14 For God no dout: wyll not reiect, hys people them to fayle: Nor yet forsake: hys lot elect, to make them long to wayle. 15 Untill that ryght: be turnd agayne, to dome, as iust it ought: And follow it: shall they full fayne, whose harte hath iustice sought. 16 O who wyll vp: for me to stand, agaynst malignant spies? Or wyll wyth me: conioyne hys hand, at wycked men to ryse? 17 If soone the Lord: had sent none ayde, to me in myne vnrest: It had not faylde: my soule dismayde, had dwelt in graue opprest. 18 But when I sayd: my foote doth reele, to note the worldes disdayne: Then helpe O Lord: thou didst me deale, thy grace dyd me sustayne. 19 As carefull thoughtes: in store dyd ryse, when thus my hart dyd boyle: Thy comfort so: dyd me repryse, my soule to scape the foyle. 20 Shall wycked seates: of tyranny, cleaue fast to thee as thence: That thou should fayne: to scourge therby, the poore by lawes pretence? 21 They cloyne in one: in companies, agaynst the iust mans lyfe: The giltles soule: of wycked vyce, they whole condemne in stryfe. 22 The Lord yet was: to me in stresse, a refuge strong of fence: My God was rocke: as inaccesse, my trust and confidence. 23 He shall them quite: their crafty guiles, as they dyd others cloy: God shall them slea: for all theyr wyles, our Lord shall them destroy. Psalme. XCV. The Argument. This cherefull Psalme: doth inuite vs in voyce: inuiteth our voyce: Due laudes to God: in our hymnes to rebounde: in hymnes to sounde: With lowly hartes: in hys grace to reioyce: that we reioyce: His worde to heare: as we duely be bound: as we be bound. Venite. 1 O come in one: let vs sing to the Lord: to prayse the Lord: And hym recounte: for the stay of our wealth, our stay and wealth: All harty ioyes: let vs duely recorde: let vs recorde: To this str?g rocke: to the Lord of our health, our Lord of health. 2 His face with prayse let vs ryse to preuent, let vs preuent, Hys factes in sight: to the world to denounce, let vs denounce: Ioyne we I say: in our ioyfull assent, in glad assent, Our psalms &amp; hymns let vs early pronounce, let vs pronounce. 3 For why this Lord: is a God of a might, is God of might, For helpe at neede: Upon whom we may call: whom we may call. A puissant kyng: in hys radiant lyght: in hys brght lyght, He passth all Gods: by his rule ouer all: by rulyng all. 4 All coastes of earth: in hys power do ligh: by hym do ligh: His celles and groundes: be they neuer so depe: though they be depe: As fast by hym: be the mountaynes on hye: stand mountaynes hye, And stoupe to hym: be they neuer so steepe: though they be steepe. 5 The sea is hys: as the worke of hys handes, his worke of handes, Her ryse and fall: with her mutable rode, with all her rode, The land from her: by authoritie standes: by power standes, Whom God so stayed: for hys stable abode. for hys abode. 6 O then come we: let vs humbly adore, let vs adore, And prostrate ligh: be we downe on our knees, on both our knees: He made vs all: both the riche and the poore, both riche and poore: Both kyng and slaue in theyr priuate degrees: in theyr degrees. 7 For God he is: as our Lord and our stay: our Lord and stay, Hys people we: in hys pasture to rest: in pasture neare: His flocke of hand: for he lead vs in way: who leadth our way: His voyce to day: if ye heare at the lest, if well ye heare. 8 Beware say I: that ye harde not your hartes, ye hard no hartes, Agaynst hys grace: when he byd you repent, to you so ment, As desert saw: in a strife ouerwhart: once strife orewhart, Lyke tempting day: of an eluishe entent, of mad entent. 9 In which pastyme: as your fathers aforne, your fathers olde, Dyd tempt my strength: to assay what I could: to proue my myght, They proued but me: in a mocke and a scorne: in scorne to bold, Where yet my workes: might they see if they would, they saw in syght. 10 Full forty yeres, dyd I chyde with this age: I blamde this age, Great griefes by them: did I suffer in mynde: I felt by thys: I sayd euen thus: wh? I spied how they raged, to spy theyr rage, They erre in hart: in my wayes be they blynde: my wayes they misse. 11 To whom I sware: in myne angry reproche, all wrathfully, By theyr foule strayes: was I forst therunto: thus forst therto, If they so euill: to my rest shall approche: my rest should see, Then blame haue I: if it euer be so: if it be so. Psalme. XCVI. The Argument. This Gentiles calleth: to (christian) fayth, In Christ to ioy their head: In whome all power: and glory layth, To iudge both quicke and dead. Cantate. 1 O syng (I bid) to God the Lord, A song of new deuise: Let all the earth: his prayse recorde, for grace most new shall ryse. 2 (Unto) thys Lord: so new sing aye, And prayse hys maiestie: Be tellyng forth: from day to day, His great benignitie. 3 To Gentiles him (looke ye) declare, Hys glory tell them all: And shew all folke: wyth all your care, Hys workes most martiall. 4 For why (no dout) this Lord is hye, Aboue all prayse so famde: To be most drad: ryght worthely, Aboue all Gods so namde. 5 For all (euen all:) the hethen gods, Be vayne, be things of nought: This Lord in heauen: hath his abode, and heauens by him were wrought. 6 All glory (prayse all) worship, fame, Be his as ornament: All prayse and power: be his to name, In heauenly firmament. 7 Ye stocks (of men) and familyes, Of peoples, bring this Lord: Bryng ye this Lord: as comly is, All laud for power of worde. 8 Yea glory geue (all ye) full true, To his sweete name most hye: Heaue vp your giftes: present hym due, His courtes thus drawe ye nye. 9 Before this Lord (his face) bow downe, Before his holy grace: Ye dwellers all: in fielde and towne, O dread his mighty face. 10 Tel ye (I say) the Gentiles all This Lord his raigne hath pight: The world is fast: not lyke to fall, And he shall iudge in right. 11 Let heauens (so hye) be glad so pure, Let all the earth reioyce: Let all the sea: in furniture, enhaunce theyr cherefull voyce. 12 The (fruitfull) fieldes: and all therin, Ought now reioyce full lite: Than shall all trees: In woode be seene, to gether ioye in sight. 13 Before this Lord: who (shortly) comth, For come to rule is he: To iudge the worlde bright brightfull dome, His flocke by verytye. Psalme. XCVII. The Argument. This Psalme in sprite: doth gratulate, Christes kingdome cleare: immaculate: Wherby such lyght: hath God detect, That truth was raisde: and lyes deiect. Dominus regnauit. 1 The lyuing Lord: doth raigne as king The erth therfore: full glad may sing The iles may ioy: so many sene, That he is come to make th? clene. 2 Thicke cloudes and darke: be him about, On wycked men: to thunder stout: Both iustice right: and equitie, Of his high throne: the bases bee. 3 The fyre him goeth: before in sight, Wyth blasing leames: of fearefull lyght: By which full wyde: he doth enflame, Hys foes to burne: which scorne his name. 4 His lighteninges shyne: the world full out, On euery side: whote sparkes to spout: The earth at sight: for feare doth quake, No puissance can: resistence make. 5 The mountaynes hye: as waxe did melte, At God his face: thus present felt: I say at face: of Lord so hye, The earth dyd feale his maiestye. 6 The heauens declare: his rightwisnes, When he by them: strikth wickednes: All peoples thus: his glory sawe, How drad he is: whom all should awe. 7 Ashamde be all: which Idols serue, Who chose vayne gods: from God to swerue Ye angels all: which seruauntes be, Come worship hym: bowe downe your knee. 8 So Sion ioyed: in hearing this, And Iury ioyd: in townes of hys: O Lord for these: thy domes entent, That such should haue: sharpe punishment. 9 For thou O Lord, doost all excell, That here by low: in earth do dwell: Exalted far: in name thou art, Aboue all Gods: so new vpstart. 10 O ye that loue: thys Lord so hye, Hate ye all vyce: of mawmetrye: He keepth theyr soules: who serue hym pure, From wycked hand: to ryd them sure. 11 Now lyght is sprong: to ryghteous man, That day from darke: discerne he can: And ioy is falne: to rightfull hart, From whence no power: can hym depart. 12 Then ioy ye iust: in thys your Lord, Thys lyght, hys grace: alway record: Hys holines: well thynke and thanke, Hys name confesse: therin be franke. Psalme. XCVIII. The Argument. Here thankes be done: Sent Christ his sonne: that God (in worde) most true, mans losse (agayne) to cure: All thinges that bee: Such peace to see: must laud hym (euer) due, restord (in earth) so sure. Cantate. 1 Syng ye all new: For he most true; Hys able hand: Hys arme so grand: to God (a song) on hye, hath meruels (newly) wrought hath (wonne hym) victory, this helth (to man) hath brought 2 The Lord of loue: So man to moue: Hys righteousnes: For theyr redresse: thys health hath (open) layd: to serue (in hart) aryght: he hath full (plainly) splayd, to Gentiles (eyes and) syght. 3 He cald to mynde: To Iacob kynde: The earth all whole: O hym extoll: hys (gentle) mercies free, hys truth (and fayth) to kepe: thys helth dyd (fully) see, thys God (our Lord) so meke. 4 Thou earth sing out: In voyce most stout: To God thy Lord: Thy songes record: all whole (I say) full glad, with (gentle) musikes sound: (reioyce) for mercy had, thou art most (duely) bound. 5 Yea sing in harpe: Sing round &amp; sharpe: Wyth harpe bid I: Your voyce apply: to God (and Lord) so hye, wyth all thy (tunes and) stringes with (note of) Psalmodie: to ioy these (heauenly) thinges. 6 With tr?pets blow: Both hye and low: Make iubilies: For Lord he is: wyth shaulme so (swetely) sing, extende your (harty) strength: before this (heauenly) king, to serue (I say) at length. 7 Let eke the seas: Thys Lord to please: The world so round: your voyce rebound: rore out in (merie) chere, wyth all her (fishe in) store: and (all the) dwellers there, to prayse (this Lord) the more. 8 The floudes a like: This Lord to seke: The mountayns hie: Let them be by Let (them now) clap their hands (wyth man) in ioyfull hart: (so houge) aboue the landes, to daunce (wyth man) in part. 9 To God do this: For come he is: Hys iustice sword: Hys equall word: let it (in sight) be plyed, (as lord) to iudge the land: the worlde shall (iudge and) guide, to all shall (euenly) stande. Psalme. XCIX. The Argument. Swete Christ his raigne: this Psalme compristh, As Rabins all: can say no lesse: God graunt that they: with vs would ryse, To sing these thankes: to hym in fleshe. Dominus regnauit irascantur. 1 The Lord to raigne: is bent therin, All folke ought than: his presence dread: He sitteth betwixe: the Cherubin, Let all the earth: then quake I reade. 2 This Lord is great: in Zion seene, Where power he sheweth: &amp; ruleth with loue And hye he is: on all the Heathen, If they a like: their hartes would moue. 3 O let them all: thy name confesse, The bad to beate: the good to blisse: For greate it is: in fearefulnes, The power therof: most sacred is, 4 All Princely power: loueth equitye, And equitye: thou broughtst in sight: In Iacobs stocke: thou didst applye, To iudgement true: and iustice right. 5 Our Lord this God: O magnifye, Both Iewes and Greekes: your wayes rel?t, To his fotestole: his sacrarye, Bow downe your knees: most reuerent. 6 As Moses meeke: so Aaron graue, Were chiefe his priestes: so Samuell: Among them were: his power to craue, They cryed to God: he hard them well. 7 To them in cloud: spred pillour like, He spake as all: the people sawe: They did his hests: and statutes kepe, Which he them gaue: in pact for law. 8 O Lord our God: thou hardst them iust, And spardst them Lord: for thine owne sake, Yea when with plagues: thou didst th? thrust, For foule attempts: which they did make. 9 Extoll this God: our Lord so free, Fall downe before: his holy hill: For God our Lord: in maiestye, Most sacred is: and iust in will. Psalme. C. The Argument. All men of breath: but temporall, Which Pilgrimes walke: this earthly Ball: To ioy be bid: here seuerall, To God in dayes: most festiuall. Iubilate Deo. 1 O ioy all men: terrestriall, Reioyce in God: celestiall, I byd not Iewes: especiall, But Iewes and Greekes: in generall. 2 Serue ye thys Lord: heroicall, Wyth ioy of hart: effectuall: Seke ye hys sight: potentiall, Wyth hymnes of myrth: most musicall. 3 Know ye thys Lord: imperiall: As God vs made: originall: Not we our selues: he vs doth call, Hys folke as flocke: kept pastorall. 4 Hys gates and courtes: tread vsuall, Wyth laudes and hymnes: poeticall: Geue thankes to hym: continuall, And blesse his name: most liberall. 5 For why this Lord: so principall, Is sweete, hys grace: perpetuall: Hys truth of word: stand euer shall, With hundreth thankes: thus ende we all. The ende of the second Quinquagene. The third and last Quinquagene of Dauids Psalter, translated into Englishe Metre. Psalme. CI. The Argument. When Dauid long: was kept from raigne, This Psalme he sang: to ease his payne: How kinges should rule: here see you playne, As he would fayne, Misericordiam &amp; iudicium. 1 Both mercy meeke: &amp; iudgement right, In Metres song: I wyll endight: To thee I will: Lord sing in sight, With hartes delyte. 2 I wyll my lyfe: beare strayt in way, If thou from me: goest not astray, In all my house: cleane hart shall lay, Without denay. 3 To wycked deede: none eye shall stand, And hate I wyll: all rebels band: To ioyne wyth me: I wyll wythstand, wyth hart and hand. 4 A froward hart: and wilfull stout; From my whole sight: shall flee full out, To me shall clout: no wycked rout, Wythout all dout. 5 Hys neyghbour who: styngth priuily, Hym will I stroy all vtterly, I will not beare: proud hart [illeg.]ye, Wyth pleasure hye. 6 True men in earth: I wyll me get, Most nye to eye: wyth me to set: Who walketh more strayt: shall serue me bet Wythout all let. 7 From far my house: they shal be sent, Who guiles can forge: or lyes inuent, None eye on them: shall firme be bent, Wyth myne assent. 8 Yea soone by day: I will deface, Proud men in earth: of wycked trace, To dryue all shrewes from Gods good place, Wythout all grace. Psalme. CII. The Argument. Here man in eare: most pituously, Wishth Syon built: defast in shame, He moueth hys long: captiuitie, Christes heauenly church: wishe we the same. Domine exaudj. 1 O Lord to thee: I cry and call. My prayer heare: O louinglye: Thou art my Lord: most liberall, Receyue my sute: admyt my cry. 2 While thus I mourne: hide not thy face, From my distresse: so wrathfully: Enclyne thyne eares: and heare my case, But soone in hast: O aunswer make. 3 My dayes lyke smoke: slyde fast apace, Consume they do: no rest they take: As fier brandes: my bones are brent, Theyr liuely powers: my sprites forsake. 4 My wounded hart: lyeth impotent, As witherd hay: cut downe by sithe, To eate my bread: from me it went, On me so sore: this trouble lyeth. 5 For gronyng lowde: in thys distresse, My wofull hart: oh panth and sith, That scant to skin: cleaneth any flesh, My bones be sene: thus wast I lay. 6 Lyke Pellicane: in wildernesse, I am, which sing: but wele away, As Owle that fleeth: all birdes in sight, In desert darke: which loueth to stray. 7 Full watch I kepe: both day and night, Myne eyes no slepe: can take for mone, To Sparow like: that leaueth her flight, In houses eues: which lowerth alone. 8 All day my foes: do me reuyle, Wyth tauntes they sport: when I do grone, These boasters mad: at me so vyle, Agaynst my soule all sworne they bee. 9 My bread that I: eate all this whyle Was ashes lyke: in taste to see, My drinke with teares: with weping menkct. So many griefes: afflicted mee. 10 My soule with cares: was full besprenct, To note thy wrath: and heauy frowne, Thou liftst me vp: as I were strengthd, But sone most weake: thou threwst me down 11 My dayes draw low: as shadow falth, When darke comth in: in field and towne, I wyther like: as blosome palth, My colour wanneth my moysture dryeth. 12 But thou yet Lord: as thee befalth, Art permanent: no man denieth, Thy memory: shall aye remayne, Where fast to dust: my nature hyeth. 13 I know thou wylt: once ryse agayne, To pitie (Lord) swete Syon mount, To shew hys grace: the tyme constraynth, The tyme is come: by iust account, 14 Thy seruants lo: desire in hart, To see her stones: to building mount, They pitie her: to spie her smart, To marke her thus: in dust opprest 15 The Gentils straunge: wyl ioyne their part To feare Gods name: of all the best, Ye kings of power: in earth all whole Shall prayse thy name for worthiest. 16 When this the Lord: shall hye extoll, In buildinges fresh: this Zyon place, And her in booke of fame enroll, When glory bryght: shall her embrace. 17 And when they see: how he is bent, To poore mans sute: in tender grace And will not be: ought discontent, To scorne theyr cryes: both all and some. 18 This thyng thus done: as monument, Shall written be: for folke to come, That countries whole: which shall arise, May laud thys Lord: wyth hye renome. 19 For God from hye: hath cast his eyes, When holy is: his sacrary, Thys Lord from heauen: in gentle wise, Hath lookt to earth: to heare the cry. 20 To heare I say: the wofull playntes, Of men fast bound: in misery, To losen them: from theyr constrayntes, Which were at deathes dore very neare. 21 That they might shew: to all hys saintes, In Zyon place: Gods name so deare, To tell all out: Ierusalem, His worthy laudes: in open quere. 22 When people whole: shall mete in realme, Of all estates: which this shall know, To serue this God: so good to them, All reignes to hym: shall them bestow. 23 Though God as yet: my strength hath beate From captine state: to iourney slow Though he my dayes: hath short extreat, I Zyon trust: yet built to spy. 24 I wyll hym thus: wyth wordes intreat, Ah God my God: to wastefully, Cut not my dayes: by halfe away, Where thy yeares last: eternally. 25 Thou laydst the earth: in stable stay At first full strong: by power deuine, The heauens euen so: none will denay, Be wrought by thee: wyth all their shyne. 26 They all shall quayle: thou yet shalt holde, As garmentes worne: waxe thinne and fine, Thou shalt them change: as vestures olde They shall be changd: thus temporall. 27 But thou art still: as we behold, And art that art: perpetuall, Thy yeares in length: shal stand in deede, For feele defect: they neuer shall. 28 We trust the more: thy seruants seede, Olde Abrahams stocke: shal not decay, Their issue Lord: by thee shal spede, Before thy face: to dwell for aye. Psalme. CIII. The Argument. The righteous man: whom God doth feede, Enioyneh his soule: due laudes to sing, For his great loue: who knowth his nede, From griefe and payne: his hart to bring, Who steyth his state: all voyde of dread, His dayes in peace: with ioy to lead. Thus playth his string. Benedic anima mea. 1 Arise my soule: blisse thou the Lord, Addresse thy selfe: his name to spread, My senses all: wyth iust accord, Within without: do it in dede, Hys holy name: due prayse record, Thus byd ye be: in his true word. So oft to reade. 2 Reuolue the same: in gratefull mynde, My soule I say: to thee agayne, His benefites to tell full kynde To thee it is: most certaine gayne, To God who will: him faster bynde, Of his good grace: the more shall fynde I tell thee playne. 3 Of all thy sinnes: the giltines, He pardon giueth: full louingly, In all thy sores: of heuines, Thou mayst in hym: haue remedy, If thou to hym: makst thine accesse In stable hart: with faithfulnes, Thine ease to spy. 4 His sauing helth: comth prestly on, To ryd thy life: from peryls all, To make thee scape: confusion, He geueth good eare: whan thou doost call, With mercy kinde: euen he alone, With round defence: he crowneth thy mone, No tyme to fall. 5 With all goov thinges: in plesantnes, He feedeth thy mouth: he filleth thy will, As Egle vseth: her new to dresse, In age for strength: to cast her bill, So he thy yeares: reuiueth afreshe: Such youth in age: can God expresse. O prayse hym still. 6 The Lord can trye: all wicked wayes, All wrong to right: whan he seeth best And though he sendth: some bitter dayes, He can them sweete: with ioyfull rest, True iudge he is: the iust to rayse, Whan force he beares: his truth to prayse, Than stay thy brest. 7 To Moses once: God did declare, His wayes his will: and all his trade, His prouidence: and daily care, To kepe his flocke: with gentle ayde, To Israell: what will he bare, Theyr practise shewth: how they dyd fare, So safe to wade. 8 They proued the Lord: most pitifull, Whole bent to grace: in tyme of neede, They felt hys helpe: most mercifull, To anger slow: but prest to meede, He pardon shewd: most plentifull, To hartes contrite: and sorrowfuil. For they must speede. 9 As do sterne Lordes: in cruelnes, Alway he is: not chidyng sore: He keepth not ire: the poore to presse He mercy hath: in louyng store, And when he fumeth: for giltines, Yet mercy staith: hys gentlenes, Prayse hym the more. 10 A proofe hereof: in vs all spy, He serueth not vs: as we deserue As our foule sinnes: for vengeance cry, But feedth our want: our neede to serue, Though hym we greue: as wretches thrall, He guideth our life: and stayth our fall. Not far to swerue. 11 How hye the heauens: this earth surmount So far doth grace: our gylt excell, Hys mercies great: most hily mount, Upon those men: in feare who dwel, Which low in hartes: theyr fautes recount, To worship hym: as feare is wont. O loue hym well. 12 How far the East: is wyde from Weast, Whose coastes and termes: shal neuer meete, So farre our sinnes: be set at rest, By hys good gift: and pardon sweete Though vs he beateth: as he knowth best No wrath it is: but loue of breast. No irefull heat. 13 For lyke hys chylde: the father vseth, To nurture hym: by chastisement, Hym farre to draw: from vayne abuse, And yet but loue: and pity ment, So God to man: doth mercy vse, Who hym to feare: doth not refuse. And will repent. 14 For he doth know: our nature frayle, Wherof and whence: we all be made, But dust and clay: who soone may fayle, Wyth weyght of earth: all heauy lade Hys grace seeth this: to our aduayle, Els should we all: both wepe and wayle. Full euill apayde. 15 Who markth of man: hys yeres in trade Shall spy hys lyfe: but misery, Euen like to herbe: though grene in blade, That witherth soone: to hay so dry, For lyke as flowers: in field do fade, So wafteth man: anone decayd. In vanitie. 16 This freshly flower: if wyndes so sterne Do hym once shake: he falth away, That where he grew: no man can learne For brittle flesh: hath brittle stay, Hys terme but short: to tyme eterne, By death once past: none hym discernth From dust and clay. 17 Though nought made here: can euer last, Gods mercy yet: holdth stable hand On hym that feare: to hym hath cast, From age to age: in euery land, Hys righteousnes: is set full fast, To man bestowd: it will not wast But aye shall stand. 18 These men I meane: of louely feare, Be such as kepe: hys godly wyll Which fast in mynd: hys worde do beare In hart and tong: to kepe it still, And alway geueth: full ready eare To God theyr Lord: to them so deare To learne hys skill. 19 Thys Lord in heauen: hath set hys place From whence he seeth: all mortall wayes Who rightly goth: who halth in pace: As lyfe he ruleth: so death he stayes, All rule doth stand: in hys good grace, The good to kepe: the bad to chace. To short hys dayes. 20 O prayse thys Lord: ye sprites of hys, Ye angels pure: of strength so great, Ye worke hys wyll: ye neuer misse, Hys power ye know: hys royall seat, Ye know what Lord: what God he is, Ye heare hys voyce: ye see hys blisse. Hys laudes intreat. 21 O prayse the Lord: all ye hys hostes, Ye armies cleare: of heauenly starres, Ye sprites so swift: ye firy ghostes, In peace ye serue: ye rule hys warres To do hys wyll: ye renne as postes, In heauen and earth: in all theyr coastes. As ministers. 22 O all ye workes: what names ye haue, In all the world: recount his grace: To make you all: he dyd withsaue, Aduaunce thys Lord: in tyme and place, O thou my soule: of thee I craue, Extoll this Lord: he wyll thee saue. From wofull case. Psalme. CIIII. The Argument. This Psalme setth out: for prouidence, Almighty Gods: magnificence: His wisdome, power: his goodnes eke, Of night, of day: of yere, of weeke, His excellence: all thyng doth kepe. Benedic anima mea. 1 O prayse my soule: the Lord of name, O Lord my God: of worthy fame: Thou doost excell in dignitie, Wyth honour clothd and maiestie. O hym proclame, Prayse his degree, 2 For he is clad: most cleare wyth light, As he were deckt: wyth vesture bryght: He spreadth the heauens: as vayle most fyne, Where lyeth hys grace: and power deuyne. O seeke hys sight, To hym incline. 3 The vpper heauens: be so arayde, Wyth waters lyke: as beames be layde: The cloudes he makth: hys charet swift, On wynde the wynges: hys walke he listh, O hym esteeme, Expend hys gyft. 5 And he doth make: hys aungels sprites In wyndes and blastes: to worke theyr mightes: The flamyng fier: is minister, Whose worde to do: they waite full nere. O loue his lightes Trust hym intiere. 6 He setteth the earth: on bases sound The seas they be: O wondrous ground: The world to ende: it shall not reale, It can no change: ne ruine feele. O hym rebound Hys myght reueale. 7 Wyth waters depe: this earth was shet, As it wyth coate: all darke beset For once the seas: as mountaynes stoode, Most hye aboue: as raging floud. O prayse hym yet: Repute hym good. 7 Though thus theyr waues: the waters spred At thy rebuke: they swiftly fled: At thy rough voyce: in thunder hard, They fast gaue vp: their hold and warde. O hym a drede: His strength regard. 8 The hils then hye: in sight dyd mount The fieldes fell low: as now they wont: As them thou stowdst: in most due place, They stand euen so: they moue no space. O hym recount: Extoll hys grace. 9 To all thynges made: thou gauest hys roume Theyr proper place: not out to come: Thou doost the seas: in boundes repose, Not backe to turne: the earth to close. O hym renome: His hand disclose. 10 He springes sendth out: to floudes to grow And they in sea: discharge we know: Betwene the hyls: they kepe their flote, To fresh the earth: with new greene coate. O hym betrow Hys larges note. 11 All beastes of field: there drynke theyr fill: They seeke their needes: though fed on hill: The asses wilde: they slake their thirst Most dry which be: so made at first. O marke hys wyll: His care betrist. 12 Theare fetherd foules: seeke harborow As nye their drinke: they sit on bough: Where byrdes do chirme: the trees among, To God theyr Lord: in cherefull song. O hym auow: And praise hym long. 13 He wetith the hyls: and makth them soft, From heauenly cels: by dewes aloft: By frutefull cloudes: which wrought his hand The showers fall down: to moyst the land. O laud him oft: Him vnderstand. 14 He makth for beast: the grasse to spring, And herbage els: for man to bryng: To serue hys neede: his bread to get, In earth such vse: in beast he set. O serue this king: His actes intreat. 15 Whence wyne is geuen: mans hart to cheare, And oyle his face: so bryght to cleare: And bread fro thence: he doth addres, Mans hart to strength: in stablenes. O count him deare: Hys laudes expresse. 16 The Lordes own trees: by man vntyld, Wyth Sap by showers: be fully fild: As Ceders hye: of Libanus, Which he hath plant: right plentuous. O praise him milde: His care discusse. 17 In these hye trees: the birdes do nest, God geueth them wit: to seeke theyr rest: The Storkes there build: and houses haue, In trees of fyrre: themselfe to saue.

Certayne verses of the sayd Psalme otherwise translated. 6 When thus they cryed to God: thus set in woes excesse: Ryght soone he dyd: deliuer them: from all theyr hard distresse. 7 For he led them the way: both ryght and prosperous: Wherby they did: a citie fynde: to dwell commodious. 8 O that men would then prayse: the Lordes benignitie: To tell what actes: ful strange he doth: to mans posteritie. 9 For that he doth refresh: the soule in thyrst so dry: And filleth the soule: that hungry is: wyth goodnes largely. 13 When thus they cryed to God thus set in woes excesse: Ryght soone he dyd: deliuer them: from all theyr hard distresse. 14 For he then brought them forth: from darke and dedly shade: He brake theyr bondes: and fetters strong: to freedom sure to wade. 15 O that men would then prayse: the Lordes benignitie: To tell what actes: ful strange he doth: to mans posteritie. 16 For he the gates of brasse: hath all to shiuers broke: And burst the barres: a sunder quite: in yron forgd by stroke. 19 When thus they cryed to God: thus set in woes excesse: Ryght soone he dyd deliuer them: from all theyr hard distresse. 20 For he then sent hys worde: he them restord by might: Wherby they scapte: destruction: from peryll saued quite. 21 O that men would then prayse: the Lordes benignitie: To tell what actes: ful strange he doth: to mans posteritie. 22 That they would offer hym: of thankes the sacrifice: And full tell out: hys workes so great: in glad and thankfull wyfe. 28 When thus they cryed to God: thus set in woes excesse: Ryght soone he dyd: deliuer them: from all theyr hard distresse. 29 For he dryueth down the stormes: and makth them soone to cease So that the waues: be still agayne: wherby they winne release. 30 Then are they glad at hart: because at rest they bee: He bringth them thus: to that theyr hauen: which they so glad wold see. 31 O that men would then prayse: the Lordes benignitie: To tell what actes: ful strange he doth: to mans posteritie. 32 That they would hym exalt: when people most be met: And prayse hym due: where Elders bee: together ioyntly set. 40 Though he doth beare a whyle: that tyrantes them oppresse, And suffer them: to go astray: in wandryng wyldernesse. 41 Yet he doth helpe the poore: from hys great misery: Hys householdes yet: he makth in part: as flockes of shepe to lye. 42 The righteous man wyll this: expend and eke reioyce: Where that the mouth: of wickednes: shall whole be stopt in voyce 43 Who that is wyse I say: will ponder all these thynges: They shall so know: what mercies free: the Lord in sorow bringes.

Paratum cor. 1 My hart to God: is ready found, Thy worthy laudes: deuout to sound: For sing I will: and Psalmes recorde, With glory due: in tong and worde. 2 Lyft vp thy selfe: thou Psaltrye sweete, Thou harpe euen so: with tunes most meete, For I my selfe: will early ryse, Newe songes to sing: I wyll deuise. 3 I thee wyll prayse: O Lord in songe. In peoples sight: euen them among: Yea Psalmes to thee: I wyll arrect. Among all folke: of euery sect. 4 For farre aboue: the heauen we see, Standth firmly thy: benignytie: Thy fayth and truth: as proufe doth teache, Most nye the cloudes: doth wholy reach. 5 Be thou exalt: O God on hye, Aboue the heauens: in maiestye: Aboue all earth: thy glory set, That men may know: thy power so great. 6 That thy beloued: from wretchednes, Whole rydde may be: in stablenesse: Let thy right hand: than vs preserue, O aunswere me: my turne to serue. 7 God spake his word: in holynes, Wherein I ioy: and shall no lesse: All Sychem iust: in partes I set, And Sucoth vale: I also met. 8 All myne no doubt: is Gilead, And so is myne: Manasses had: And Ephraim: my reigne the strength, And Iuda is: my guyde at length. 9 Land Moab is: my water pot, And Idumye: my conquerd lot: Wheron my sho: extend I wyll, On Philistyne: ioy shall I still. 10 Who hath me brought: to be so nye? That cytye great: so walled hye: Who led me forth: so iust to come, To Idumye: to wynne renome? 11 Was it not thou: I say O God? Which vs forsokst: cast wyde abroade: Which didst not walke: as God with vs, With our mayne hostes: victorious? 12 O geue vs helpe: and that at hand, Of all our griefe: of troubles band: For weake the helpe that man can do, Most vayne to trust: it is euen so. 13 In God we shall: all strong endure, By hym to do: aduentures sure: And he our foes: shall sone debell, To treade them down: though hie they swell. Psalme. CIX. The Argument. Here Dauid vext: by tyrannye, hath Doegs spite bewrayed: Whose successour: we Iudas spye, who falsly Christ betrayed. Deus laudem. 1 O God my ioy: and all my prayse: in whome I glory most: Hold not thy peace: thy vertue rayse: destroy my haters bost. 2 For wycked mouthes: and mouthes of gile: at me be open set, Wyth lying lippes: they me reuile: wyth tonges most false they iet. 3 Wyth hateful wordes: they compasse me: such gall in hart they haue They fight at my: sinceritie: they causeles me depraue. 4 For loue I had: to them in hart: they seeke my hurt and bloud, Yet dyd I pray: to ease my smart: wherin I wysht them good. 5 For good they euil: agayne requite: to malice so they bend, And so for loue: I shewd in sight: whote hate they do repend. 6 Some wycked man: O constitute: on hym to breake hys band, Let Satan stand: and execute: hys power agaynst hys hand. 7 When iudged he be: for any deede: let hym as gilty come, Hys prayers whole: ill mought they speede: to sinne turnd all in some 8 And let his dayes: abriged be: in yeares but fewe to go, His office eke: withall his fee: Some other take hym fro. 9 Let all his seede: and issue sprong: full sone be fatherles, And let his wife: be widow young: and curst with barennesse. 10 As wandrels make: his childrens stray: to beg &amp; seeke their bread, Depryued so: their houses gay: abroade to desert led. 11 Yea let his goodes: the vsurer: all wholy catch in net, And let also: the forriner: by spoyle his labours fet. 12 Let no man be: in any place: to pitye hys distresse, And no man helpe: with any grace: his children fatherles. 13 To wast be led: his progenye: to ioy in no degree, Their name be blot: from memory: no second age to see. 14 His fathers crymes: be they reuiued: in mynde before the Lord, His mothers sinne: to her deryued: and styll of God abhord. 15 Yea let them hange: in open sight: before the Lord for aye, Dryue he their fame: all whole &amp; quyte: from all the earth away. 16 Because no loue: he had in brest: to any nedy wight, But did pursue: poore man opprest: to kill the hart contryte. 17 He curse ensued: he ioyed therin: it came hym home the more, He blesse eschued: none would he wynne: it shal hym flee therfore. 18 To cursednes: he whole was set: as clad for all the nonce, As water yet: his bowels wet: as oyle it pearst his bones. 19 Let it therfore: as cloke to be: hymselfe to wrape therin, With gyrdell gyrt: so like be he: alway euen next the skyn. 20 This mede from God: to them befall: which me resist in hate, To them euen all: in generall: agaynst my soule that prate. 21 But do thou Lord: my Lord with me: as it becommeth thy name, For sweete is thy: benignitye: O ryd me far fro shame. 22 For sore afflict: and poore I wepe: I am all destitute, My hart within: is wounded deepe: in death nye constitute, 23 As shadow fast: I passe away: as day doth low declyne, As grashopper: remouing aye: from place I am so dryuen. 24 My knees do reale: all fatigate: in fasting long from meate, My flesh is dryed: for lacke of fat: or oyle to make it sweate. 25 A foule rebuke: to them I seemde: on me they strangely gase. As laughing stocke: they me esteemd: &amp; shoke their heads apace, 26 O helpe me Lord: my God withsaue: to thee alone I clyue, Preserue me sure: thy grace I craue: and shortly me reuyue. 27 And let them knowe: in this thy ayde: that this is whole thy hand, That thou thy selfe: my state hast layd: so strong by thee to stand. 28 And let them curse: so thou do blesse: O Lord of all most drad, Yea let them rise: but foule to misse: to make thy seruaunt glad. 29 Let all my foes: with shame be broke: as clad therwith echone, Let them be wrapt: as iust with cloke: in their confusion. 30 And I with mouth: will celebrate: the Lord with thankes on hye, When people most: be congregate: I wyll his laudes applye. 31 For that he stode: in poore mans nede: at his right hand so strong, To saue his soule: fr? iudges drede who might him stroy by wr?g. Psalme. CX. The Argument. Though Dauids raigne: be somewhat ment, Yet Christ is chiefe: here prophecied, Who was both kyng: in regiment, And priest in death: then after stied, To heauen to sit: as priest and king, His frendes to saue: his foes to wring. Wyth death the sting. Dixit dominus domino. 1 The Lord most hye: the father thus, Dyd say to Christ: my Lord his sonne Set thou in power: most glorious, On my ryght hand: aboue the sunne, Untill I make: thy foes euen all, Thy low footestoole: to thee to fall. As subiectes thrall. 2 The Lord shall send: from Zion place, Of thy great power: imperiall, The royall rod: and princely mace, Whence grace shall spring: originall, Yea God shall say: thou God vp ryse, To raigne amids: thyne enemies. In princely wyse. 3 The people glad: in hartes delight, Shall offer giftes: in worship free, As conquest day: of thy great might, In shinyng shew of sanctitie, For why the dew: of thy swete birth, As morne new sprong: dropth ioyfull mirth, So seene on earth. 4 The Lord did sweare: and fast decreed, He will hys worde: no tyme repent: Which sayd thou art: a priest in deed, A kingly priest: aye permanent, Of order namde: Melchisedeck, Whom peace and right: doth ioyntly decke, As Gods elect. 5 The Lord as shield: kepth right thy hand, To make thy raigne: inuincible, He shall subdue: by sea and land All power aduerse: most forcible, He shall great kyngs: and Cesars wound, In day of wrath: all them confound. By fearefull sound. 12 He iudgement true: shall exercise, As iudge among: the Gentile sect, All places he: shall full surprise, Wyth bodies dead: on earth proiect Abrode he shall: in sunder smyte, The heds of realmes: that him wyll spyte, Or scorne hys myght. 13 Though here exilde: he strayth as bond, And shall in way: but water drynke, Of homely brooke: as comth to hand, Pursued to death: and wysht to sinke. Yet he for thys: humilitie, Shall lift hys head: in dignitie. Eternally. Psalme. CXI. The Argument. This laudatory is: and thankth Gods gentlenes, Who made all thyng: and vs redeemd: from sinne and wretchednes. Confitebor tibi. 1 With all my hart I will: the Lord commend on hye, Met secretly: with faythfull men: in church eke openly. 2 Full greate be all the factes: of this hye Lord in name, Most exquisite: and may be found: of them that loue the same. 3 His deede is worthy prayse: most worshipfull I say, It Glory is: and comlynes: his iustice lasts for aye. 4 Of all his wondrous workes: remembraunce hath he made, The Lord is good: and mercifull: to Israell in trade. 5 For meat and spoyle he gaue: to them that feard hym due, So myndfull he: will euer be: his pact and league to sue. 6 His actes great power shewd: to all his peoples sight, In geuing them: the heritage: of Gentils landes for right. 7 His workes of hands be seene: all truth and equytye, And his precepts: all faythfull be: in iust confirmytye. 8 Upholde they stand most firme: and euer wyll remayne, For made they are: by verytye: and equytye agayne. 9 He sent hys people guydes: which them to freedome lad, His pact he bad: should euer stand: whose holy name be drad. 10 The feare of God is sayd: of wisdome first the way, Who keepe hys hests: haue wisdome cleare: whose prayse shal ner decay. [Psalme. CXII. This doth recite, The prayses right, of hym that feareth the Lorde: Whose constancy, Lyeth perfectly, in God by faythes accorde. Beatus vir. 1 That man is blest: and liueth at rest: that fearth the Lord most pure, Who hath delyte: most exquisite: to worke hys byddinges sure. 2 No doubt hys seede: shall firmly speede: in all felycitye, These regents hye: theyr progenye: most blessed shall they be, 3 He riches store: in house the more: wyth plenty shall possesse, Hys righteousnes: in stablenes: shall last and still increase. 4 And light shall spred: from darknes drede: to godly mens reliefe, The Lord benigne: aye pitiyng: and iust to ease their griefe. 5 This blisfull man: he pitye can: and lend with diligence, His word and deede: by wisdoms reede: he rightly shall dispence. 6 For moued he: can neuer be: Gods arme shall hym defend, The iust shall sure: in fame endure: till all the world doth ende. 7 At tydyngs euyll: no tyme he wyll: stand dreadfully hymselfe, Hys hart for why: stands stedfastly: he trustth the Lord of health. 8 His hart so great: is stable set: to feare nothyng aduerse, Untyll hys eyes: their lust espies: on all hys foes peruerse. 9 He spredth hys store: he geueth the poore: hys iustice yet abidth, His power shalbe: exalted free: with glory large and wyde. 10 The euyll shall see: and fret shall he: shall gnash his teth and lower, The wicked lust: of men vniust: shall wast and turne full sower. Psalme. CXIII. The Argument. This praisth Gods grace on hie: therto it doth inuite, His dignitie and prouidence: it doth in part endight. Laudate pueri. 1 Ye seruauntes (all: ye) children meeke, prayse ye the Lorde of all: Prayse ye hys name: extoll ye due, hys power potentiall. 2 Gods (worthy) name: be blest fr? hence: tyl all y? world haue ende To dread and loue: his power aboue: God graunt we all contende. 3 Fr? time y? Sunne (doth shine) in rise: til downward fallth y? same From East to West: O blessed be: the Lords sweete holy name. 4 For why (no fayle) the Lord doth rule: on Gentils all that be, Yea heauens he passth: in glory bright: thys Lord of maiestie. 5 For who is lyke (this God) the Lord: in glory fame or power? Who hath set vp: himselfe aboue: as chiefe and gouernour. 6 And yet he bowth: himselfe (full low) of hys great gentlenes, All thynges that be: in heauen and earth: to see in carefulnes. 7 And he it is (at will) alone: that liftth the poore from dust, The nedy man: he doth promote: in dong that low was thrust. 8 To make hym (hye: and) equall sit: wyth Princes rule to beare: Yea that wyth Peeres: of age most graue: of his own people deare 9 And he (alone) the baren makth: in fruitfull house to dwell, As mother glad: to ioye in babes: O prayse the Lord then well. Psalme. CXIIII. The Argument. Here ioy is made: that Iacobs seede, Did Ægipt scape: in luckie speede: That led they were: by Gods great might, To Canaan land: to them behight. In exitu. 1 When Israell: from Egipt went, Where God them held: in chastisment: When ryd from thrall: was Iacobs house, Of people fierce: and barbarouse. 2 Then Iury land: was consecrate, True God to serue: full dedicate: Than Israell: was hys Empire, Hys subiect made: to rule intyre. 3 Which thing whan that: the sea did spye, She fled to see: Gods power so nye: And Iordan floud: reuersed was, As geuyng place: hys arke to passe. 4 The mountaynes leapt: as Rammes full light, Aboue the waues: th'appeard in sight: The Hillockes eke: did skip full glad, As Lambes in grasse: all fat bestad. 5 What meanst thou sea: to flee so fast? Thou Iordan why: aback wart cast? Was this the cause: Gods truthfull grace? Or fathers fayth: that ye gaue place? 6 You Mountaynes hye: why leape ye thus? As Rammes with fruite: most plenteous: Ye litle hylles: why skypt ye so? (Thys sight to see) as yong sheepe do? 7 At Gods bright face: the earth thus shooke, At Iacobs Gods: most present loke, Be whole adrad: than earth to see, Thys puissant Lord: so nye to bee. 8 Whose power dyd turne: the stone to gushe, Great water brokes: most merueylous: The flint so hard: whence fier springth, Euen water flouds: he made it bring. Psalme. CXV. The Argument. Thus Gentiles Gods: be scornd vnpure, Where God of heauen: is God most sure: On hym to trust: to lawd hym aye, Who blessth our lyfe: and keepth our way. Non nobis Domine. 1 No prayse geue vs: O Lord to vs, Geue it thy name: most glorious: For thy sweete loue: for thy good truth, Defend vs Lord: and shew thy ruth. 2 Why els no doubt: the Heathen sect, Would say where is: their God so tect? If God they haue: as we in sight, Let hym come forth: and shew his might. 3 But sure our God: is God in heauen, Not made or seene: to carnall eyne: He doth at will: what lyke hym best, He made all thinges: by hym they rest. 4 Their Idols all: the best, they bee, But siluer cast: and gold to see: The handy worke: of mortall men, They be thus made: full brittle then. 5 Wyde mouthes they haue: but speake no whit Of speache but domme: to them most fit: And eyes they haue: yet haue no sight, All voyde of lyfe: all voyde of light. 6 So eares they haue: but heare nothyng, How loud men cry: in halowing: And nose they haue: but haue no tast, Their brent incense: on them is wast. 8 Yea handes they haue: but handle nat, Two feete they haue: but haue no gate: They make no voyce: from out theyr throtes, Where yet small flies: haue open notes. 7 As those be all: so such be they, Which make them first: of gold or clay: And so be they: which worship them, Or them do trust: in any realme. 9 But thou that seest: O Israell, Trust thou the Lord: bid them farewell: The Lord is whole: thyne ayde and shield, Protectour sure: in towne and field. 10 Ye Aarons house: trust ye this Lord, None other serue: to hym accord: The Lord is whole: your ayde and shield, Protectour sure: in towne and field. 11 All ye that feare: the Lord so hye, Trust ye this Lord: to hym applye: The Lord is whole: your ayde and shylde, Protectour sure: in town and filde. 12 The Lord hath mynd: and careth for vs, He wyll vs blesse: most prosperous: And Iacobs house: so will he blesse, Blesse Aarons house: he wyll not mysse. 13 Who feare the Lord: he blesse them all, Both rich and poore: both great and small: To do them good: is hys entent, Who worship him: most reuerent. 14 The Lord wyll adde: to your encrease, To heape hys gyftes: he wyll not cease: Uppon your selfe: in ioyfull cheare, And after on: your children deare. 15 Ye are the Lordes: most blessed lot, Yf feare in you: be not forgot, The Lordes ye be: hys heritage, Who made of heauen: and earth the stage. 16 The heauens so houge: the heauens I saye, Be all the Lords: in whom they staye: The earth he gaue: to men a place, To dwell therin: to serue his grace. 17 The dead that be: prayse not the Lord, No sence in them: no voyce or word: Ne they whose corps: be layd to rest, By them no laudes: can be exprest. 18 But we alyue: wyth voyce and hart, Wyll prayse thys Lord: tyll we depart: From thys tyme forth: and so for aye, Than sing we styll: Alleluya. Psalme. CXVI. The Argument. When Dauid scapt: aduersitie, to God wyth thankes he goes, So man full past: all miserie, may so hys hart disclose. Dilexi quo niam. 1 I loued haue: the Lord and shall, wyth all my hart for why: He soone hath heard: my prayers all, wyth voyce when I dyd cry. 2 Full nye I say: his eare he bent, to me most redily: Wherfore my dayes: that me be lent, hym will I call most hye. 3 The snares of death: dyd close me in, yea panges of hell me found: Fell anguish smart: and woes betwene, I felt about me round. 4 Eftsoones I cryed: in Gods good name: for helpe and sayd euen thus: O Lord I pray: thy grace I clame, my soule from payne discusse. 5 Of clemency: the Lord is full, and iust he is in worde: And this our God: is mercifull, which doth all grace aforde. 6 The Lord preseruth: the simple ones, as abiectes counted here: For lo my selfe: was wo begone, and health he brought me nere. 7 Wherfore I sayd: O turne agayne, my soule into thy rest: Since that the Lord: hath easd thy payne, for thyne aduantage best. 8 For thou O Lord: hast ryd my feares, my soule from death besyde: And eke myne eyes: from wepyng teares, my feete from falling wyde. 9 To walke in life: I purpose then, before the Lord vpright: Whyle here I lyue: with liuing men, on earth to please his sight.Credidi propter quod. 10 I held my fayth therout I spake, to God in hope full strong: Although with woes: my hart did quake, and sorowes seamed long. 11 In all my flightes: so forst to flee, I sayd thus halfe amasd: All men on earth: but liers bee, myne eyes were so adasd. 12 To quyte my Lord: what shall I geue, hys benefites at length: His grace so great: by whom I lyue, surmounth my simple strength. 13 I will take vp: and heaue on hye, the cuppe of thankfulnes: And Gods good name: besech wyll I, who compast all my wealth, 14 To God my Lord: I now will paye, my vowes that I behight: With thankfull hart: from day to daye, In all hys peoples sight. 15 The Lord no doubt: full deare reputes, the death of all his saynts: He taketh to hart: their wrong pursuts: and heareth their wofull playnts. 16 For truth, lo I: thy seruaunt lord, thy seruaunt this may speake: Thy hand maydes sonne: can this record, for thou my bandes didst breake. 17 To thee therfore: I offer shall, of thanckes the sacrifice: The lordes good name: theron to call, I will in gratefull wise. 18 To God my Lord: I wyll repaye, my vowes that I behight: With thankfull hart: from daye to daye, in all hys peoples sight. 19 In all the courtes: euen iust in them, of Gods hye house so bright: In mydst of thee: Hierusalem, O prayse this Lord aright. Psalme. CXVII. The Argument. This Hymne doth endight, Gods glorious might,— His truth and grace most free, That Gentils a farre, Were made to be narre, With Iewes one flocke to bee. Laudate Dominum. 1 Prayse duly y? lord: in myndful accord: ye hethen ones all vayne, Ye Gentils I bid: recount how ye slid: &amp; prayse this Lord agayne. And honour ye right: this Lord in his light: ye nations all in town All people I say: where euer ye lay: extoll this Lordes renowne 2 For meerly hys grace: and mercifull face: confirmd lyeth on vs all: Hys loue doth excell: all sinne to debell: his grace is generall. This lord in his truth: most stable ensuth: his word &amp; promise iust The faith of his way: will neuer decay: O praise this lord of trust Psalme. CXVIII. The Argument. This Psalme is sung: of prayse and laudes: that Dauids rule begonne: In sprite it shewth: and ioyeth the raigne: of Christ Gods onely sonne. Confitemi ni domino 1 O thanke and laud: the heauenly lord: for he is gracious, Because his loue: and mercy free: for euer standth to vs. 2 Let Israell: nowe glad confesse: wyth song melodious, Because his loue: and mercy free: for euer standeth to vs. 3 Let Aarons house: and stocke confesse: in thankes most plenteous, Because his loue: and mercy free: for euer standeth to vs. 4 Yea let them all: that feare the Lord: this grace in hart discusse, Because his loue: and mercy free: for euer standeth to vs. 5 In trouble layd: to straytes be thrust: I cald the Lord from thence He hard at large: and set me wyde: this Lord of excellence. 6 The Lord as thus: with me to stand: on my nye side to be, I can not feare: for what can man: preuayle in spite at me. 7 The Lord takth part: with them to ioyne: that me do helpe &amp; ayde Myne eyes shall see: their full desire: my foes reuengd and frayd. 8 O good it is: the Lord to trust: on hym all hope to cast, More sure it is: then man to trust: on hym to leane to fast. 9 Yea good it is: the Lord to trust: to hym all whole to stand, More safe it is: then Prince to trust: with all hys gard and band. 10 Though nations all: do compasse me: and hedge me round about, By name (I trust (of this the Lord: I shall cut downe theyr route. 11 Let them besege: and compasse me: on euery side at wyll, The Lordes good name: I hope therby: theyr pride to quel &amp; kill. 12 Though they lyke bees: swarme me about: to sting, to hurt, to noye They soone shall fade: as fyer in thornes: in God I shall them stroy. 13 By pushing oft: they thrust at me: to make me full agast, But yet the Lord: my piller strong: was whole my stay ful fast. 14 The Lord of power: my strength he is: of laudes my tenors style, For he was made: my health and fence: to scape all mortall guyle. 15 The voyce of ioye: and healthful mirth: rebound in iust mens tents For why ful great: the Lords right hand: hath wrought experim?ts. 16 The Lords ryght hand: exalted is: hys power is clearly knowen, The lords right hand: great feates hath done: mans strength is not his owne 17 Not dead I am: but liue as yet: and trust to spend my dayes, To tell Gods workes: his mighty actes: by whom my liuing stayes. 18 The Lord although: he me correct: in chastisment most fyt, Yet downe to death: he draue me not: he would not so permyt. 19 Ope me the gates: of righteousnes: that iust men vse to haunt, To enter now: Gods temple so: the Lord with prayse to vaunt. 20 This gate is wyde: the Lord his gate: where due his grace is spred All rightwise men: do passe therin: who faythfull life haue led. 21 I wyll wyth thankes: set out thy prayse: for thou hast answerd me Though thou didst strike: yet ease thou setst: for helth I had by thee. 22 The stone it selfe: which was reiect: by all the buylders choyce, Was made the heade: and corner stone: to all good mens reioyce. 23 From god the Lord: this act issued: his worke it was alone, A thing it is: most meruelous: in all our eyes so done. 24 This is the day: the ioyfull day: which that the Lord hath made, Let vs therin: reioyce and sing: a day that shall not fade, 25 Ah Lord helpe now: and saue I praye: assist vs presently, O Lord on hye: geue helpe I praye: good lucke send speedely, 26 O blest be he: that comth as thus: in God the Lords good name, To you as we: gods house that kepe: haue wisht good lucke &amp; fame. 27 God is the Lord: and lightned vs: all health who luckly sendes, Sprede bowes therfore: and bynde your hosts: with cords at alters endes 28 Thou art my God: whom thanke I will: whom I shall celebrate, Thou art my God: to whom my laudes: I will whole dedicate. 29 O thanke and laude: the heauenly Lord: for he is gracious, Because his loue: and mercy free: for euer standeth to vs. Psalme. CXIX A Preface to the Psalme. 119. Made is this Psalme: by Alphabete: in Octonaries folde, All letters two: and twentie set: as Hebrues them haue tolde. The verses all: an hundred bee: threescore and iust sixtene, Thus framde and knit: for memorie: and elegance some wene. Here letters all: so sortely bound: do shew in mysterie: Eternall health: may sure be found: in scripture totallie. Uerse yokt by eight: Christes rising day: doth figure them in some, Sweete Saboth rest: not here I say: I meane of world to come. Peruse this psalme: so wide and brode: eche verse saue one is freight As still in termes: of law of God: most ofte by voyces eyght. Right statutes, olde precepts, decrees: c?maundem?ts, word, &amp; law. Known iudgem?ts, domes, &amp; witnesses: al rightous wais thei draw Enuie no man: Gods worde to painte: in arte by such deuise, Reade Hebrue tonge: the tong so sainte: and causeles be not nise. Upfolde be here: Gods truthes discust: right sure vs all to teache, So lies of man: all low be thrust: full false in glosing speache. The Argument. This Psalme dewrayth: good mens desire, Gods law to know so milde: Which Dauid prayth: whom men in ire, Did curse, from home exilde. Aleph. 1. Beati imculati. 1 A rightvp man: of perfect wayes: is blest and blest agayne, As blest be they which walke their dayes: in gods true law so playne. 2 And yet I speake: so blest they be: who kepe his witnesses, All whole in hart: which will agree: to search Gods promises. 3 Admit they do: no sinfulnes: who walke his pathes alwayes, At wil who worke: but wickednes: they tread not these his wayes. 4 Aduisedly: thou gauest in charge: thy hests that we should kepe, Approued so: by thee at large: for vs most due to leke. 5 Ah then O lord: where y? wilt so: would God my wayes were steyd Affected right: in hart to go: thy statutes iustly leyd. 6 Ashamed then: I shall not shrinke: in hart or visage cold, Abacke to stand: what tyme I thinke: thy lawes and them behold. 7 Ascribe will I: to thee my thanke: in hart most right and clene: Assoone as I: shall learne so franke: thy iudgements iust besene. 8 Agayne I vow: withall my hart: to kepe thy true decrees: A far then Lord: do not depart: from me thy grace to leese.

Ad dominum cum trib. 1. Canticum graduum. 1 To God when I: was vext wyth smart, By wrongfull meanes: of man opprest: I cryed in voyce: I cryed in hart, He aunswerd me: at my request, In gentle part, He gaue me rest. 2 For thus I sayd: and still will say, O Lord my soule: deliuer free: From lying lips: saue me I pray, From crafty tonges: that double bee. But set all day, To vanitie. 3 What shalt thou winne: what gayne or gift? Thou crafty tong: with all thy spyte: Or what may that: increase thy thirst, False tong to vse: in such delyte? What is thy drift? What winst in sight 4 Euen this thou wynst: sharpe dartes and fell, Of Gods strong hand: in dreadfull feare: Whose strength shall send: thy spite to hell, As whote as coales: of Iuniper. And marke it well, In mynd it beare. 5 O wo is me: that myne abode, Is still prolongd in hard exile: Thus forst to dwell: as cast abrode, In Ceder tentes: both blacke and vyle. O helpe me God, Me reconcile. 6 Ah long to long: my soule abydth, Wyth such as hate: good loue and peace: With people rough: of hawty pryde, Which fierce in hart: on me do preace, O cast them wyde, Their magre cease. 7 Whan peace I seeke: they cry to warre, Whan fayre I speake they threat the more: Whan them I sue: they driue me farre: Thus gall for loue: I gaine in store. O God be narre, Help me therfore. Psalme. CXXI. The Argument.

We trust him well. 5 The Lord himselfe: wilbe thy shield. The Lord shalbe: thy shadowes bower: At thy right hand: most nye in field He will thee keepe: both day and hower. By godly power. 6 The sunne by day: shall thee not burne, But shine therof: shall cleare thy way, The moone by night: shall serue thy turne: Her frory hornes: shall thee not fray. But be thy stay. 7 The Lord our God: will thee preserue, From all euill haps: from all mischaunce: The Lord wil saufe: thy soule conserue He will thy fayth: and fame auaunce. In Gouernaunce 8 The Lord will keepe: and keepe mought he, Thy comming in: thy going out: By puissant power: (thus pray all we) From this tyme forth: the world about. We haue no dout. Psalme. CXXII.

Graduum. 1 Most glad I was (saith good man so) When men deuout: said thus to me, Come we in one: in will we go, the lordes hie house: of maiestie &amp; pray him to. 2 Our feet shall stand: in certentie, Within thy gates: Hierusalem, Within thy courtes: where we shall see, Gods true electes: to ioyne with them, In perfectnes. 3 Hierusalem: thou shinyng beame, Thou builded art: in peacefulnes, As citie els: in any realme, Where men may meete for holines. In tymes select. 4 For thither haue: the tribes accesse, Euen Gods owne tribes: by him elect, I meane Gods flocke: of Israell, To laude hys name: by lawes respect, His prayse to tell. 4 For there the seates: be duly dect, To iudge the truth: by priesthoodes spell, Set there we see: of Dauids house, His iudgement seat: there iust to dwell. Most glorious. 5 O wishe and pray: all ioyfull peace, Hierusalem: to haue euen thus: Who loue thee well: or wishe thyne ease, All ioy haue they: most prosperous, Well God to please. 6 O peace befall: thy walles so wyde, No forren power: to worke disease: God graunt thy towers: may strong abide, In all successe: most happely, By God the guide. 7 My brethernes sake: my neighbours nye, Make me thus speake: vp on thy side: To wishe thee peace: so earnestly, Thy welth to stand: from day to day, O Mount most hye. 8 Yea thus I seeke: thy wealth I say, For Gods house sake: our Lord of loue, Whose regall power: therin doth lay O thus do we: our hartes to moue, In sprite to pray.

Lyke Israell, We must confesse. 4 The storms, &amp; flouds: of woes so base Had drownd vs quite: by theyr exces The roring streames: so swift in pace Had drencht our soules remedilesse. Like Israell: We must confesse. 5 Proud swelling flouds: so ran in race To whelme our soules: in heuynes: Our rest of life: they would deface. And thought therin: great godlinesse. Like Israell, We must confesse 6 With hart most kind: let vs embrace, This louing Lord: w? thanks to blesse who duld theyr teeth: our flesh to race Their pray so sought: in gredinesse. Like Israell We must confesse. 7 Our soules as birds which foulers trace Be scapt their snares: of wickednesse Which they with craft: did interlace, The snare is broke: we haue release.

So iust the same we wil confesse. Psalm. CXXV. The Argument. This Psalme commendth: against our foen, Almighty Gods protection: Yf we in faith: to him can clyue, No power aduerse: can vs contryue. In vaine they striue. Qui confidunt. 6. Canticum graduum. 1 Who stickth to God: in stable truste, As Sion mount: they stand full iuste, which moueth no whit: nor yet c? reel, But standth for aye: as stiffe as stele. Than trust him wele. 2 Hierusalem: with hils is set, Enuyroned: with bulwarkes great: Right so the Lord: standth round about, His people nye for euer stout. Without all dout. 3 For wicked power: with all his tayle, On iust mens lot: shall not preuayle: Lest rightwise men: should put their hands To wickednesse: for feare of bonds. So ny God stands. 4 Do well O Lord: in loues respect, To godly men: though here reiect: And right vp men: of parfyte hart, O them embrace: in gentle part. As God thou arte. 5 But who to wrong: will backe declyne, Of croked drifts: who draw the line: Where wicked waile: god them shall leade, But Israell shall ioy in meede. Without al dreade. Psalme. CXXVI. The Argument. This Psalme in sight: doth prophecy, What myrth is made: most worthely: When God doth worke: deliuery, From soules or bodies: misery. To liberty. In conuertendo. Cantic? Graduum. 1 What tyme the Lord: shall backe repry Hard Sions thrall: to death so nye, Appeare shall we: then dreamingly, Such ioy vnlookt: for then to spy, So sodenly. 2 Our mouth shall laugh: then plentuously, Our tonges shall flow: with songs full hye, Then Gentils shall: say openly, For them the Lord: wrought royally, We see at eye. 3 The Lord no dout: shall magnify, For vs his power: most notably, Thus may we ioy: then restfully, Our thraldome past: all totally. So blessedly. 4 O Lord returne: then spedely, Our captiue state: our drudgery: As riuers cheare: the south so dry, So shall thine acte: vs gratefy. Most louingly. 6 Who soweth in teares: all mourningly, Hys corne bought deare: in penury: Shall reape agayne: yet ioyfully. To see increase: his neede supply. So fruitefully. 7 Who goeth from home: all heauily, With his seede leape: his land to try: He home returnes: wyth hocky cry, With sheaues full lade abundantly, Reioycingly. Psalm. CXXVII. The Argument. This Psalme describeth: Gods prouidence, Whence man must spye: his suerety: In house &amp; towne: his whole defence, Or els shall he: his ruine see. In vanitye. Nisi dominus. 8. Canticum graduum 1 Except the Lord: the house vp buylde They toyle in vayne: who buylde most fayne: Except the Lord: becityes shielde, The watchman playne: loose all theyr gayne They win but paine 2 But labour lost: that soone ye ryse, That late ye creepe: you safe to kepe: That bread ye eate: in carefull wise, Where God geueth slepe both sound &amp; deepe To his good sheepe 3 Lo childern be: an heritage, From God so sent: beneuolent: The frute of wombe: to comfort age, From God is lent: by his assent. Munificent. 4 As arrowes strong: in Gyauntes handes, Make strength appeare: to scape all feare, So childern yong: to Gods men standes, As staffe and speare: in age most deare, To them full neare. 5 O well is him: whose quiuer is, With such full dight: his house well pight, At iudgement gate: they shall not mis, To plead their right at foes despite, Their shame to quite. Psalm. CXXVIII. The Argument. This Psalme intreat: the wedlocke state, Yt maketh Gods feare: most fortunate: Where both be met: well God to serue, Who can them deare: to make them swerue. Synce God will: here Them both preserue.

In sea and lond, most luckely. 3 Thy wife most deare: as frutefull vine, Shall spread thy house: the sides to byne: Thy childerne cleare: shall florish out, Like Olyue bowes: thy bourde aboute. Thus God alowes, Thy state no dout. 4 O geue good eare: expend it than For happy so: shalbe that man: Who iust in feare: to God doth bend: His life to woe: can not descend. God clyueth him to, And him defendeth. 5 The Lord blesse thee: from Sion hye, With grace supreame: she blest mought lye: That thou mayst see: while life is prest, Hierusalem: in goods possest. This come to them, In feare who rest. 6 And God geue grace: that thou maist spye Thy childrens seede: and progeny: God shew his face: to Israell, In peace to speede: In ioy to dwell. That al good deede, May there excell. Psalm. CXXIX. The Argument. As Syon vext: to God she can, In prayers meeke: her refuge make: So Christe, his churche, and christen man In God theyr Lord: may comfort take. In harte yet glad, For Christs his sake. Sepe expugna. 10. Canticum graduum. 1 Great grief they haue: against me wrought Yea oft and oft: from day to day: From vp my youth: they quarels soughte, Speake Israel: now truly may.

So christen man: in like may praye. 3 The plowers plowde: vpon my backe, Theyr errours mad: yet thought full gay: My truth, so strong: they could not slacke, Their forrowes long: had short decay. So Christ his spouse may ioyntly say. 4 The Lord so iust: their cords hath cut, Their wicked yokes: to ren a stray. In prison bound: they kept vs shut, But God them all: hath driuen to bay. So Christen man: in life may praye. 5 Let them be shamde: confounded still. And backeward tornd: in theyr aray All they which hate: sweete Sion Hill, Or that woulde els: her quiet fraye. So Christ his churche may ioyntly say. 6 Let them how grene: they seeme to stand, Be like in sighte: the witherd haye: On houses tops: pluckt vp by hand, That fadeth to nought: without delay. So Christen man: in like maye praye. 7 Whereof in dayne: the mowers gripe When they to such: theyr hands do splay Nor gleaners can: fynd sheaues so rype, That they to fyll: theyr bosomes maye.

De profundis. 11 Canticum Graduum. 1 In deepe excesse: In heuynes, O Lord to thee: my crying went From depth of hart: I did expresse, My great constraynts: most viol?t. In deepe excesse. 2 O Lord assent: O here attent, My wofull voyce: in redines, O let thyne eares: to harke be bent, My prayers cry: in lowlines. O Lord assent. 3 If thou wouldst presse: mans sinnefulnes, O Lord to send: due punishment, Who could O Lord: the waightines, Sustayne to byde: thy chastisement. If thou wouldst presse. 4 Be Lord content: lo we repent, For thou shewest grace: to humblenes Thus feard to be: most reuerent, Then kepe no sinnes: in irefulnes, Be Lord content 5 I hope release: I trust no lesse, The Lord I byde: still permanent: My soule expecth: hys frendlines, I wayte his wordes: accomplishment, I hope release. 6 My soule so ment: more confident, To wayte my Lordes: great gentlenes, Then watchemen wishe: the night full spent, And wayt the morne: theyr watche to cease.

To cleare his state. 1 Domine non est. My hart proud things (lord) counted not Myne eyes aloft: haunt mounted not: In boasting actes: I walked not, Things past my reach: I stalked not. Lord deare me not. 2 If I my hart: refrayned not, If I my soule: restrayned not: If I as childe: beweynd me not, If I from pride: absteynd me not. Then heare me not. 3 O Israell: most fortunate, Wayte thou the Lord: still moderate: Be meeke, flee pryde: inordinate, From this tyme forth: interminate. And feare thou not. Psalm. CXXXII. The Argument. This Psalm doth pray: for good successe, Of all thy realmes: &amp; priesthodes state: So Dauids oathe: this vow hys stresse, VVhat god him hight: it doth debate. Yt Christ expresse. Memento domine. 13 Canticum graduum. 1 Remember Lord: meke Dauid king, And al his hard: affliction, For his good sake: by pityenge, Amoue from vs: confusion. Haue hym in mynd. 2 How he in good: deuotion, To thee hys Lord: hymselfe dyd bynde, By othe and vow: to God most hye, To thee I say: strong Iacobs frende. Thus constantly. 3 Be it my shame: if I go in, My Cabborne house: in rest to lygh: If I my sheetes: thrust me betwene, And clyme my couche: in fethers soft, Blame might I winne. 4 Or els if I: myne eyes aloft, Should geue them sleepe: myne eies the lids, To suffer them: to slumber oft, Though fast they craue: to fill their needes, Then fall myne house. 5 Untill I fynde: without all dreades, The Lord a place: commodious: A sacrary: and temple sweete, To Iacobs God: victorious. To hym most meete. 6 Of this place lo: I Salomon, In Ephrata: hard there in streete, And found we haue: this holy throne, 2. Par. 21. In Ornans field: wyth woodes beset. O come ye on. 7 To his fayre tentes: go we to fet, To temple built: hys arke of grace: And bowe we low: with honour great, To his footestoole: hye set in place. And thus say we. 9 Aryse O Lord: and kepe thy place, Of quiet rest: no more to flee: O thou thy selfe: soone thither moue, Thyne arke of strength: conioynd with thee, O Lord of loue. 10 And let thy priestes: be deckt alway, Wyth right and health: as them behouth: Let all thy saintes: reioyce I say, So blest by thee: to prayse the due. Both nyght and day. 11 For Dauids sake: thy seruant true, To whome thy grace: did louely spring Shame not my face: so chosen new, Thyne owne (O Lord) annoynted king, My hart to freat. 12 The Lord in fayth: sware promising, To Dauid backe: he wyll not treat: Of thyne owne wombes: engendred frute, I will to one: bestow thy seat. All lyke in sute. 13 If that in truth: thy childerne wyll, My pact and statutes: execute: Which I will teach: then shall euen still Thy childern sit: thy throne for aye. Wyth my good will. 13 For why the Lord: without denay, Hath Zyon mount: elect in choyce: He much desird: that it should lay, As seate wherof: he would reioyce, And thus he sayd. 14 Here shall my rest: from troubly noyse, Remayne full sure: for euer stayd, Here will I dwell: for her I wisht, In my desire: full well apayd. Of her I wist. 15 Her vitayles all: with full increase, Shall blesse alway: my blissefull fiste, Her poore to feede: wyth bread at ease, I will them all: full satisfy, If me they please. 16 I will their priestes: adourne on hye, With helth; wyth truth: wyth lyfe, w? light: And they his saintes: shall sanctify, That they may ioy: in hartes delight, With holines. 17 There Dauids horne: and regall might, I will it make: to florish fresh. And there I will: a lyght prouide, To myne owne Christ: by frutes successe, Of Dauids syde. 18 And all hys foes: wyth vtter shame, I will them clothe: and them deryde As yet for hym, hys crowne, and name, Shall florish out: both large and brode, In blessed fame. So graunt in God. Psalm. CXXXIII. The Argument. A short extrete: of loue the strength, So large in length: in tast so sweete: O charity: thou art I wisse, Of Man the blisse: in ech degree: O charity: wyth vnity. Ecce qu? bonum. 14. Canticum graduum 1 O come and see: how things most meete It is, and sweete: where men agree: Whan brethren bound: together dwell In peace to dwell: In loue be founde, O vnity: keepe charitye. 2 It is as sweete: as Balme the best, On head well drest, which downe did fleete, By berd and throte: the berd I say, Of Aaron gay: his skirt of cote. O charity: seeke vnitye. 3 It is as sweete: as dewe that wont, Fat Hermon mount: to make so weete As dew no dout: that heauenlye stils, On Sion hils: euen round about. O vnity: beare charity. 4 For there euen there: the Lord hath chargd, Where peace enlargde: most rule doth bere: All blisfull lyfe: for aye to be, Where men agree: and voyd all strife.

Apply no lesse, His fame to spread. 3 The Lord of grace: Blisse he this place: Who heauen did make: For all our sake: From Sion Hyll, Your hart and will, And earth I say, Both nighte and day. Embrace, him still, Awake, and pray. The ende of the songes of the Stayers. Psalme. CXXXV. The Argument. This Psalme endited seemth, for ministers in quiere, Gods workes it telth, vayne Gods it scornth, it singth Gods laudes full cleare. Laudate nomen domini. 1 O worship thanke and praise: the name of God the Lord, Ye seruauntes all: of thys your God: laud ye with one accord. 2 Ye ministers which stand: in God the Lordes good house: And kepe the courtes: of this our God: O prayse hym glorious. 3 Laude ye the Lord for why: the Lord is gracious, Syng out his name: for sweete it is: to man delicious. 4 The Lord no doubt hath chose: vnto hymselfe in care. Olde Iacobs stocke: all Israell: for hys peculyar. 5 I knowe the Lord is great: and hye I him esteeme And that our God: passth other Gods: which m? for gods do deeme. 6 And what it lyketh them: the Lord doth it in deede, In heauen and earth: in sea full out: in deepes where fishes breede. 7 He vapours lifth from earth: and they to clouds do renne, He lightnings turnth: to raine in store: he winds drawth out of d?ne. 8 To quite their cruelnes he smote in Egypt land: Theyr fruites first got: not one to scape: from man to beast in band. 9 In midst of thee: the Lord his signes and wonders sent: Thou Egipt land, which Pharao, and all his seruants shente. 10 He many countryes smote, and dyuerse nations slew: He vanguished: most mighty kings: and made them all to rew. 11 Of Ammorites theyr kyng: hight Seon hie in throne: So Og, that hog: of Basan king: and Canaans realmes echeone. 12 And gaue theyr lands and holds: for heritage of right: For heritage: to Israell: his people whole and quite. 13 O Lord thy name endureth: for euer world to ende: From age to age: thy memory: in fame shal stil extend. 14 For now the Lord hath iudged: his peoples cause most playne: He them auengd: and pleasd he was with all his flocke agayne. 15 The Gentyls, Images: be siluer molt and gold: But handy worke: of wretched men: how euer they be fold 16 Mouthes haue they made in them? but speake nothing at al, So eyes they haue: and nought they see, blind Gods and casuall. 17 And eares they haue in shape, and yet they heare no sound: Where beast most domme: hath life and sprite, no breth in them is found. 18 As they be all to see, theyr makers be the leke: Domme deafe, and dead, brute stockes and blocks: so all which th? do seeke. 19 Ye house of Israell, do well, prayse ye the Lord, Yea Aarons house, preach ye his praise: the lords great actes record 20 Ye Leuis house and seede, blesse ye the Lord all whole Ye all that feare and worship true, this Lord most hye extoll. 21 O praysed be the Lord, of Sion nighte and day, His place is set Hierusalem: O prayse the Lord I say.

When Babilon: the Iewes supprest, they tell how they did playne, From whence well rid, they her detest, to wishe her spoylde agayne. Super flu mina. 1 At water sides: of Babilon, euen there we sate and wept: While Syon mount: we thought vp? remembring Gods precept. 2 We hong among: the Salow trees, our Harpes and Organs all: No ioy we had: with weeping eyes, to matters musicall. 3 They craued of vs: who thrald vs wrong, Some dyties melody: In scorne they sayd: sing vs some song, Of Syon merely. 4 How can we syng: sayd we agayne, The Lordes sweete songes deuyne: In land so strange: who vs constrayne, we must all mirth resigne. 5 If I should thee: cast out of mynde: O good Ierusalem, I would my hand: went out of kinde: to play to pleasure them. 6 Yea let my tonge: to palate sticke: if that I minde thee not. If Syons prayse: I should not seeke:: as chiefe to ioy in that. 7 The Edomits O Lord, requite, for Salems heauy day, Who cryed wast her: spoyle her in sight: euen flat on ground to lay 8 O Babilon: thou doughter light: which waylst thy spoyling deepe: Well mought he speede: that thee did quite: as thou madst vs to weepe. 9 And well fare him: that toke thee ones, which vs downe fiercely threwest: Who flong thy babes: agaynst the stones, as ours in rage thou slewest. Psalm. CXXXVIII. The Argument. Whan Dauid skapt: much wo on kynde Thus thanks to God he dyd extende So taughte by proofe he vowed in mynde, That he of God would styll depende. As he entendth.

As men expende. 3 For this I sawe: what day I cryed, Thou answerdst me: most louingly: To my poore soule: thou lentst I spyed, More grace, so strength: to multiply. Thus didst thou lende. 4 All kings of earth: prayse thee they must, O Lord most true: as right allowth When they shall here: performed iust, Thy word to me: which spake thy mouth. They will contende. 5 Loe they shall sing: with harts most free, Of all the Lords: most rightful wayes: That great is God: in maiesty, So they his name: shall euer prayse and thanks repend. 6 And that the Lord: though placed hye, Who glory hath: as God aboue: Yet he the meke: respecth full nye, And knowth the proud: from far aloofe. him low to bend. 7 What though I walke: in midst of woe Yet wilt thou me: reuiue and ease: And stey by power: myne Irefull foe, Thy right hand strong: shall me release.

O God thou hast: ful searcht me out, Thou knowst my harte and reines: Accused I am: to compasse in, Both king and realme wyth traynes. 2 My sitting downe: my rising vp: my Actes thou knowest echone Thou vnderstandst: my thoughts a far: before I thinke them on. 3 My walks thou knowst: my rests &amp; steys: my bed thou goest aboute Yea al my wayes: thou hast contriued: all sercht by the no doute. 4 No secret word: in all my tonge: so whispered closly in But thou O Lord: it knowst at whole: although it make no dinne. 5 For why thou me: thy selfe didst frame: behynd, before in forme: Thou laydst thyne hand: to this my clay: thy hands did me perform 6 This knowledge is: to meruelous: for me to reach I knoow, To hye and hard: for me to fetch: by hye or yet by lowe. 7 And whether can: I thinke to goe: fro this thy sprite and thought, From thee in face: how can I flye: or whether shall I flought. 8 If I do clime: to heauen aboue: euen there thou artfull neere: If so by low: I make my bed: In hell, thou art lo there. 9 If now I take: the morning wings: who spredth her beames so swift That strayt I cowd: to fordest Sea: remoue my house to shift. 10 Yet there thy hand: shall lede me forth: as pastor guideth his sheepe thy strong right hand: would me vphold: by prouidence most deepe 11 If eke I say: or thinke at least: that darke shall hide my heade: Than shall the night: as shining day: be round about me spreade. 12 For sure the darke so dark: cannot: endarke thy louely sight: The night as day: do shine to thee: so darkenes is as light. 13 For iust my reynes: with theyr affects: are thine how hid they be, In wrapst thou me my mothers wombe: with vestures sonderly. 14 I geue thee thanks: for that I am: in shape formd straungely, Thy works so hye: be wrought in me, which playnd my soule doth spye. 15 My substance first: both bones &amp; Ioynts: were nothing hid fro the In earth ful depe when I was wrought: and wouen was curiously 16 My masse vnshapt: thyne eyes did see: was writ in thine owne boke By dayes increase: my parts were formd: wh? none on them could looke 17 How dere to me: O God appere: thy thoughts, these counsels gret How manifold: be but the summe: In count if they were set. 18 If I would tell: the summe of them: they should exceede the sand: Than this reuolued: I watch to thee, by thee I trust to stand. 19 If thou uow wouldst: thy self O God: confound that wicked man: bloud thursty men: whome I defye: would leaue me wholy than. 20 For these they be: that fight at thee and speake vngraciously: They vse thy name: in vayne to light: thy foes be puft to hye. 21 Do I not hate: all them O Lorde: who thee with hate disdayne? And fret not I: and fume at them: which rise at thee by trayne? 22 Yes Lord from hart: I hate them all: with perfect hate and fyne Thy foes I take: myne enemies: as they were onely myne. 23 Than search me God: and boult my hart: to thee this cause I yelde Well try and know: in thoughte and driftes: what hauntes in life I held 24 And see in me: if any wayes: be founde rebellious, Then lead me forth: the worldly way: of death obliuiouse.

This prayth for good: (and iuste) deliuerance: Fr? wayting spies: &amp; guyleful (fawning) fr?ds Yt sheweth eu?so: what ones (at l?gth) shal chance To good and bad: in both theyr (finall) ends. 1 Eripe me domine. O Lord most good: (in haste) deliuer me, From man that is: so euell and (wholly) nought O keepe me saufe: In (stedfaste) suerty, From wrongful man: of (cursed) wicked thought. 2 To euill theyr hartes: do whole (alwaye) agree, From whence they haue: all (suttle) mischief wrought, To hate and bate: them selfes they (fullye) bende, But strife all day: by them is (vainely) sought. 3 Theyr tongs so sharpe: (on me) they haue extende, As serpent slye: (as snake) moste pestilente: Like Adders sting: theyr (venome) poyson sende, Sela Such poyson they: in (fawning) lippes frequente. 4 My sely soule: O Lorde: (my God) defende, From wicked power: most (fierce and) violent: From wrongfull men: O me (good Lorde) preserue, To trip my foote: by them is (lewdly) ment. 5 These hawty men: (to death) to make me sterue, Hath hid theyr snares: with (suttle) cordes in brayde: And spred their nets: me thus they (wayte to) serue, With wily trappes: my wayes (and steps) they layde. 6 Yet sure from God: I would not (farly) swerue, To whom in fayth: euen thus I (boldly) sayd: Thou art my God: O heare my (wofull) mone, From hart the roote: by tong (in word) displayd. 7 My Lord and God: my trust (most iust) alone, My strength and health: my (closely) couerture: Thou shieldst my hed: to scape my (deadly) fone, In day of warre: to stand (on foote) full sure. 8 Permit not Lord: whyle thus (for wo) I grone, His will to haue: this (wicked) man vnpure: To hys attempt: (O Lord) geue no successe, Sela Lest proud they swell: and harme (the more) procure. 9 O let theyr lippes: in (crafty) wickednes: Betrap themselfe: in all their (daily) paynes: O let their hed: feele first (their due) distres, That compasse me: wyth suttle (wily) traynes. 10 Let burnyng coales: for their (so mad) excesse, Fall downe on them: to dull their (hasty) braynes Let fire and pit: be (wholy) theyr rewarde, No tyme to ryse: to (any) better gaynes. 11 Of bablyng tong: who hath no (bit or) warde, O let them Lord: here neuer (proue to) thriue: Him euill shall hunt: till he (to nought) be marde, No wealth to hym: (at all) shall downe deriue. 12 Full sure I am: God will (most kynde) regard, The poore mans case: with ayde (and ease) beliue: Of helpelesse man: to try his (truth and) right, In iudgement strong: for hym (alway) to striue 13 Thus righteous men: (so met) in open sight, Shall prayse thy name: (O Lord) that is so high, Then strayt vp men: in heauenly (ioyous) light, Shall see thy face: (to lyue) eternally. Psalme. CXLI. The Argument. Here Dauid prayth: for stedfastnes, among the wycked sect: To scape theyr traps: and wyckednes, That they may low be chect. 1 Domine clamaui. O Lord I haue: lowde cryed to thee, to me therfore make spede: Unto my voyce: thine eare agree, whyle that I cry in drede. 2 O let my sute: in syght so ryse, as doth incense to thee: My rayse of handes: as sacrifice, of nyght, Lord let it bee. 3 Lord set a watch: before my mouth, kepe thou my mouth and lips: To speake nothyng: but truth and south: to scape all snares and trips. 4 Let not my hart: declyne to euill, with wycked workes inurde: With wycked men: to worke in will, by their delites allurde. 5 Yea let the iust: as frendly led, me smite and blame I say: No wycked balme: to stroke my hed: agaynst them still I pray. 6 O hedlong be: their iudges thrust, as down from rockes bethrowne: They would haue harde: my wordes at first, if swete they had be browne. 7 Our scattred bones: they breake in moode, so nye the graue they lay: As man which cleauth: and shiuerth woode, or one that clods doth bray. 8 For that myne eyes: O Lord to thee, O Lord be firmly cast: And thee I trust: then vtterly, spill not my soule in wast. 9 O kepe me saufe: fro crafty snare: which they to me do driue: From wicked trappes: that men prepare: which wickednes contriue. 10 But rather let: these wicked fall: all whoel into theyr nets: Betrapt themself: so be they all: while I may scape theyr threats. Psalm. CXLII The Argument. What Dauid thought: and how he prayd, whan feare draue hym to caue: He here reporth: on God he stayed, who did him strongly saue. 1 Vocemea ad Domi num. Vnto the Lord: with voyce I cryed, So nye in parell set: Unto the Lord: my prayer hyed, both hart and voyce were met. 2 I pourd my sute: my sore complaynt, before his face in sight: My troublouse state: I did depaynt, before himself in light. 3 What tyme my sprite: was inly pent, my life thou knewest the path: Yet layd they snares: vext though I went, in all my walkes in wrath. 4 On hand both right: and left I vewed, none saw I that me knew No scape was free: none so endued, that once my soule woulde rue. 5 O Lord than thee: I cryed vpon, and thus I sayd euer then: Thou art my hope: and portion, in land of lyuing men. 6 Respect my crye: for worne I goe, in cares full deepe I wayle: Saue me fro them: which vext me so on me they sore preuayle. 7 O bring my soule: from prison bound Thy name to celebrate: So iust men wil: me glad surround, whan thou shalt quite my state. Psalm. CXLIII. The Argument. VVhose hart wyth hate the world resolueth, To state all base deiect: If he in fayth this psalme reuolueth, God sone wyll him erect. 1 Domine exaudi. Now heare my sute: O Lord in stresse: to my request agree: For all thy truthes: and rightwisenes: sone aunswere thou to me. 2 (But enter not: to iudge extreme: thy seruant hye by lawe: For who himselfe: can cleane esteme: yet him I neuer saw.) 3 For loe the foole: my soule hath chasd: to earth my life hath wrest: My state in darke: he hath abasde: as men of old deceast: 4 My pinched sprite: in me doth fayle: opprest in heuines: My hart sore vext: doth morne and wayle: astoynd in pensiuenes. 5 Old yeares from fyrst: I haue recount: our fathers how thou ledst: Thine actes I marke: how hye they mount: I muse the woorkes thou didst. 6 My hands to thee: I held full hye: that thou wouldst me vouchsaue: My thristy soule: as pasture drye: thy graces dewe doth craue. 7 Then heare me Lord: but sone heare thou: my sprite doth feble ligh: Hyde not thy face: from me as now: least strayt my graue I spy. 8 Thy voyce at morne: cause me to heare, for thee I trust alone: Shew me thy wayes: my steps to steare, my soule to thee is gone. 9 O rid me Lord: from all theyr spite, that would me causeles trayne: For I to thee: referre my right, in hid defence full fayne. 10 Teach me to worke: thy will to please, thou art my God I say: And let thy sprite: so neuer cease, to leade me straite the way. 11 For thy sweete name: Lord quicken me, from them that me pursue: And make my soule: from perill free, my hart with ioy endue. 12 Thy grace I trust: my foes will quell, and make their strength but lame: Who vexth my soule: thou wilt debell, for I thy seruant am.

Psalme. CXLV. The Argument. Thys Dauyd framde: by Alphabete, Where God he th?kth (in hart) most hie Whose power &amp; might: whose grace so great, In prouidence (most cleare) we spy. 1 Exalta[illeg.]o. Arise I will: my God and king, to rouse my grace (w? t?g) most hie and blesse thy name: to me bening I will (and shall) eternally. 2 Both day and night: I will declame, thy (worthy) laudes most thankfully: By praysing due: thy holy name, for aye (and aye) without delayes. 3 Clere is this Lord: most hye of fame, his state surmounth: all (mortal) prayse: Can no man search: how he excell, in greatnes hym (by weight) to paise. 4 Describe to age: shall age full well, thy (handy) workes: with reuerence, Declare they must: where that they dwel, thy (godly) mightes: magnificence. 5 Enhaunce I shall: thy glory bright, thy fame (and name) thine excellence: Enditing still: thine actes of might, so wonderfull (that be) to see. 6 For that that man: may speake &amp; wright, thy (princely) dedes. that dreadfull bee: From hence euen so: I will resound, thy (godheds) grand abilitie. 7 Good men shall preach: how grace abound in thee (O Lord) with gentlenes: Glad songes to sing: they will in sound, of thy great (truth and) bounteousnes. 8 How good the Lord: how gracious, he is to all in (paynefull) stresse: How slow to wrath: not furious, his mercy ruleth (and stayth) his ire. 9 In loue he is: most piteous, to all that him (therof) require: Imprinted be: his mercies sure, on all his workes (all whole) intiere. 10 Know this will euery creature, with thankes (most due) O Lord to thee Kynd harted men: will them inure, (in hart) to blesse thy maiestie. 11 Loude will they speake: thy regall seat, most glorious (at eye) to see: Lord, so shall men: be glad to treate, thy power (deuine) so tried by deede. 12 Men thus will still: thy strength repeate, to Adams stocke: and (liuing) seede: Most wide they will: with kinde assent, thy kingdomes (laud: and) glory sprede. 13 No dout the reigne: is permanent, a reigne (of blisse) to stand for aye: Nedes must thy power: and regiment, endure (in length) from day to day. 14 O sure in worde: the Lord is tryed, most faithfull true (and iust) alway: On all his workes: his will is spyed, most holy (God all) them to saue. 15 Poore wauering men: the Lord bestrideth their stay (and hold) by him to haue: Playne faln or wrongd: he reiseth againe, if they their reyse (in faith) can craue. 16 Quicke eyes all thing: doth fastly straine, on thee (O Lord) so good at neede: Quite all their foode: they aske so fayne in tyme (most fit) thou geuest in deede. 17 Right wide thou splaist: thy blessing hand, all liuing things (wyth store) to feede: Refresht by thee: so full to stand, with plenty (fed in) foode delight. 18 Still iust appearth: this Lord so grand, in all his wayes (to man) aright: So wholy he: doth aye appeare, in all his workes of (his great) might. 19 The Lord to all: approcheth nere, to him (for helpe) which make request, To all I say: soone them to heare, which call (on him) with faithfull brest. 20 With ready speede: he filleth their mynd, who feare hym (iust both) most and lest: Unto their cry: he bendth so kynd, and saueth them (whole) as him (it) likth 21 Exceding sure: before behynde, the Lord hys louers (frendly) keepth: Exile he doth: vngodly men, to scatter them (most wide) he seekth. 22 Yelde shall my lipps: by duetye then, this Lords deserued: (laud and) prayse Yea let all flesh: geue thankes agayn, to his good name (most due) alwayes.

Thys psalme exciteth the Iewes: to prayse the Lord most chiefe: So good to them: who priuatly: did worke them all reliefe. 1 Laudate Domin?. Prayse ye the Lord alway: for good it is to sing, To this our God: for sweete he is: whom laudes we ought to bring 2 God buildeth Hierusalem: he doth her sure protect: The poore exiles: of Israell: he shall agayne collect. 3 He heald the brusde in hart: who wayle in sprite contrite, Theyr plages and sores: he bindeth them vp. he cureth th? al ful light. 4 No dout God them beholdeth: who starres by number tels: By proper name: he calth them all: he knowth theyr rests and cels. 5 The Lord of ours is greate: and great he is in power: His knowledge is: all infynite: his name as strong as tower. 6 The Lord vpholdeth thafflict: So gentle is his will: He throweth to ground: all wicked men: So mightye is his skill. 7 O sing to God our Lord: prayse ye his raygne abroade: Confesse his power: hys will his skyll: In harpe sing ye to God: 8 Who clothe the heauen with cloudes: and raygne to earth prepares He bringes forth gras: on hills to growe: to serue mans dayly cares. 9 Who geueth to beast theyr foode: to all both great and small: The rauene her birds: he feedth in care: whan they forsaken call. 10 In barbed horse of strength: his pleasure standth not in: In legs of men: in force of armes: it pleaseth not him to wynne. 11 They please who feare the Lord: by such he fyght with strength: who trust all whole his gentlenesse: these only please at length: Lauda Hierusalem. 12 O Thou Ierusalem: prayse hye the Lord of thyne: Thou Sion mount: auaunce thy God: in hart therto encline 13 For he makth fast the barres: of all thy gates full prest: He blissth euen so: thy childer al: in midst of thee to rest. 14 And he doth stablish peace: In all thy borders sure: He feedth the full: deliciously: with wheate the flower most pure. 15 Who sendth his word on earth: and swiftly doth it renne: Both rayne and wynd: his biddings heare: to serue the nede of men. 16 And snow he geueth like woll: the earth so warme to be: The hory frosts: the mislyng dewes: as ashes scattreth he. 17 He castth abroade his yse: like morsels so congelde: and his great cold: who can abyde: that he so hard hath seald. 18 He sendth his worde &amp; will: he melt them all agayne: He blowth the winde: then they anone: to waters flow most playne. 19 Yea he reuealeth his word: to Iacobs seede and stocke: His statutes true: his iust decrees: to Israel his flocke. 20 He delt no time as thus: with other landes I say: He shewed not them: his domes so playne: O prayse the Lord alwaye Psalme. CXLVIII. The Argument. To prayse here all be byd: what heauen or earth contayne: The Lord so hye: and sapyent: nothyng he made in vayne. 1 Laudate Domino in Cœlis. Prayse ye the Lord: from heauens: ye heauenly mynds I call, Prayse him on hye: as hye he is: ye powers celestiall, 2 Prayse hym ye Angels all: his legats ye that be: ye hosts so cald: his armies great: prayse hym in maiesty. 3 Prayse him ye sunne and moone: in course so maruelous, Ye starres so bright: ye Planets all: prayse hym most glorious. 4 Ye heauens by heauens distinct: prayse him with all your shyne, ye water streames: aboue the ayre: so stayde by power deuyne. 5 They all might prayse and laud: the Lordes good name of myght, For he the worde: but spake at once: they straight were made in plight. 6 He constituted hath: that they should euer dure, He set a law: which shall not cease: by ordinance most sure. 7 Ye earthly thinges on earth: prayse ye the Lord with them, Ye dragons grim: ye depes and gulfes: shew ye his power supreme 8 Fire, lightning, thunder, hayle, both snow and vapours drye, ye hurling wyndes: tempestuous: which worke his word full nye. 9 Great mountains hils and clifs: low hillockes all and some, ye fruitefull trees: ye Ceders all: prayse ye the Lordes renome. 10 Ye beastes and cattell all: both sauage wylde and tame, ye serpents slye: ye fetherd soules: prayse ye his godly name. 11 So kinges of earth most due: with all their people met, So princes hie: and iudges all: on earth as Gods be set. 12 So yonger men and maydes: in age syncere and pure, As older men: with childer yong: with all their busy cure. 13 The Lordes name let them prayse: for it alone is hye: His glory passth: both heauen &amp; earth: as thyngs here made do cry. 14 He hath his flock aduanced: so him his saintes shall prayse, Euen Iacobs seede: who drawth him nie: praise ye the lord always. Psalme. CXLIX. The Argument. Thys Psalme the Iewes doth moue, Theyr God to laude wyth loue: It sheweth that grace on them shall lyght, So glad their foes to quyte. 1 Cantate Domino. O syng vnto the Lord, A song of new accord: And let his prayse: declared bee, In good mens company. 2 Let Israell be glad, in God hys maker drad: Let Syons youth: and childer ioy, In their most princely roy. 3 Let them prayse out in quiere, Hys name to them so dere: In Tabret loud: in harpe so soft, Sing they to hym ful oft. 4 For why the Lord reioyce, And loueth hys flocke in choyce: The meke forlorne: he will adourne, wyth health to serue theyr turne. 5 So godly men made free, in ioy and prayse shal bee: They shall reioyce: vpon their beds, That God did rayse their heds. 6 Their throtes shall prayses sound, to God by duety bound: Two edged swordes: in both theyr handes, to smite all forren landes. 7 To be auenged right, of all the Paynyms spite: To be a rod: to chastise smart, straunge peoples froward hart. 8 To bynde their kinges wyth chaynes, to quite their wrongfull meanes Theyr nobles eke: to kepe in warde, wyth iron fetters hard. 9 To bryng on them in speede, theyr iudgement iust decreed: Which shall his saintes: to honour rayse, prayse ye the Lord alwayes.

And raisde he hath: saluation, Most mighty now: for vs eche one: Of Dauids stocke: so vertuous, His seruauntes line: and noble house. As he dyd speake: in tymes of olde, By holy Prophetes: mouthes so tolde: Which were his will: to vtter than, And haue bene since: the world began.

Also my sprite: both day and hower, Reioyceth in God: my sauiour: Not me my selfe: but thee O Lord, I do extoll: in hartes accord. For he hath thus: regarded mee, His handmayd true: of low degree: Whose poore estate: and simple house, He doth accept: so bounteous. And now behold: the kyndreds all, Shall me henceforth: right blessed call: So thou hast sayd: by thy good worde, As aungels voyce: doth well recorde. For he that is: most mighty tride, Hath me set vp: and magnified: By his good grace: he doth the same, For holy is: his worthy name. And mercy great: that he doth beare, Is shewd to all: that do hym feare: On kinredes all: by him alone, He helpes vs now: and hearth our mone.

Quicunque vult. Who saued will be: before all thinges, He must true fayth: fast hold in all: which safe &amp; sound: who kepth it not Without all doubt: he perish shall. This is the fayth: calde Catholike, Euen through the world: full out so famde: To serue one god: in Trinitie: In Trinitie: but one so namde. Confounding not: theyr persons three, Their substance sundred cannot be: The father, sonne: and holy goste, Be diuers yet: in persons three. The godhed yet: of them all one, Of father, sonne, and holy Sprite: Theyr glory lyke: their maiesty, All one eternall, is aright. The father such: the sonne is such, The holy gost: is such a lyke: The father hie: the sonne euen so, The holy gost: vncreat eke. The father god: the sonne the sprite, Incomprehensible they be all: Eternall god: eternall sonne, The holy goste eterne we call. Yet they not three: eternals be, But one they stande: eternally: Not three distinct: in power or tyme, But one all whole: in vnitie. The father houge: of power he is, The sonne, the holy ghost euen so, Not three almighties so be sayde, But one almighty knowne no mo. The father God: the sonne is God, The holy ghost: euen so is God Not yet three Gods: but one is God, In all the world: so long and broade, The Father Lord: the Son is Lord, The holly Ghost: is truely Lorde, Not yet three Lords: but one is Lord We say and singe: in true accord. As we ech person: God and Lord, Be bid by Christian truth to name: Forbidden so: we be by fayth, three gods or els: three lords to frame. The Father made of none: nor born, Of none begotten well we know: The sonne of God: alone not made: Nor created, begotten thoughe. The sprite is iust: of God and so Of Christ not got: proceding yet: One Father so: one son, one sprite, Not thrise in name: these persons set. In Trinity: not one beforne, Nor yet behynde: more great or lesse: These persons three: all equall be, Eterne a like: we must confesse. So that in all: this vnity: In trinity: I say agayne: The trinity: in vnity, We must adore: as one full playne. Who saued will be: most rightly iuge The Trinity: forsooth euen thus: And helth eke aske to think y? Christe, Incarnate was: made flesh for vs. For this is fayth: both right &amp; sounde That we beleue: and iust confesse: That Iesus Christ: the sonne of God Is God and man: our Lorde no lesse. Of God his substaunce, God begot, Before the worlde: was made in sight And man he is of Maryes flesh, His mother him: in world so dight. He perfect God: and perfect man: Of soule with reason most indued: Of humayne flesh: subsistyng is, By whome our nature was renued. Christ equall is: in Deity, To God so great: his father iust: Yet greater he: and Christ the lesse, For birth in manhoode so discust. Who though he be: both God &amp; man, One Christ he is: in deede not two: To flesh his godhed did not chaunge, But taking flesh: on godhed so. Of substance whole: he is vnmixte, By person yet: he is but one, As soule wyth wit: and flesh one man One Christ is so: both God and man Who suffred death: for all our health, And downe he went in sprite to Hel: He did yet ryse: from death agayne, The thyrd day iust as scripture telth. To Heuen he stied: and there he sitth On gods right hand: which mighty is from whence he shall: return to iudge The quick and deade: all right I wis And when he comth: all men shal ryse In bodies dead: reuiued agayne: And geue they shall: accompt full due of al their thoughts: &amp; works so plain. And they that haue done good I saye, Shall enter sure to life eterne: And they that haue done euill, to fyre To darknes cast: that is externe. This is the fayth: most Catholike, Which any man, if it mistake: And faythfully doth not beleue, No wight him saued: once can make. Veni creator. Come holy Ghost: eternall God, Which doost from God proceede. The father fyrst: and eke the sonne, One God as we do reade. Oh visite thou: our minds and harts, Thy heauenly grace inspire: That we in truth: and godlinesse, May set our whole desire. Thou art O sprite: the comforter, In woe and hard distresse: The heauenly gift: of God so highe, Which tongue cannot expresse. Thou fountayne art: and liuely spring, Of ioy celestiall: The fyre so bright, the loue so cleare, and vnction spirituall. For thou in gifts: art manifold, Whereby Christs church doth stand: And wrightst thy loue: in faythfull hartes, The power of God hys hand. And like as thou: hast promise made, Thou geuest the speach of grace: That through thy helpe: the prayse of God, May sound in euery place. O holy Ghost: to moue our wits, Sende downe thyne heauenly light: Inflame our harts: our God to serue, With loue both day and night. Our weaknes strength: confyrme vs Lord, Both feeble faynt and frayle: That nether flesh, the world, ne deuill, In vs do once preuayle. Put backe from vs: our enemies, And graunt that wee obtayne: Sweete peace of hart: with God and man, From grudge and proude disdayne. And graunt O Lord, O leader sure, That we by thee as guide: May safe eschue: the snares of sinne, From thee no tyme to slyde. And plenty Lord: of thy good grace, Graunt vs we humble pray: Be thou our ioy: and comforter, To scape that dreadfull day. Of stryfe and foule: dissention, O Lord dissolue the bands: And knit the knot: of peace and loue, Through out all Christen lands. Graunt vs O Lord: through thee to know The Father most of might: That we of his: beloued sonne, May sure obtayne the sight. And that with perfect stable fayth, We mought acknowledge thee: The sprite of them: of both I say, One God and persons three. Be laude to God: the father hye, And God his sonne prayse ye: Be prayse to God: the holy sprite, One God in Trinity. Pray we that Christ the sauiour, Uouchsafe his sprite to send: To all which true: professe his name, Till all the world doth ende.</field>
