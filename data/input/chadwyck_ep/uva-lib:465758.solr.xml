To His Grace THOMAS Duke of Newcastle. PASTORAL POEMS. Nostra nec erubuit sylvas habitare Thalia. Virg. Ecl. 6. THE FIRST PASTORAL. If we, O Dorset, quit the city-throng LOBBIN. If we, O Dorset, quit the city-throng, To meditate in shades the rural song, By your command, be present: and, O bring The Muse along! The Muse to You shall sing: Her influence, Buckhurst, let me there obtain, And I forgive the fam'd Sicilian Swain. Begin.âIn unluxurious times of yore, When flocks and herds were no inglorious store, Lobbin, a Shepherd-boy, one evening fair, As western winds had cool'd the sultry air, His numb'red sheep within the fold now pent, Thus plain'd him of his dreery discontent; Beneath a hoary poplar's whisp'ring boughs, He, solitary, fat to breathe his vows, Venting the tender anguish of his heart, As passion taught, in accents free of art: And little did he hope, while, night by night, His sighs were lavish'd thus on Lucy bright. âAh, well-a-day! how long must I endure âThis pining pain? Or who shall speed my cure? âFond love no cure will have, seeks no repose, âDelights in grief, nor any measure knows: âAnd now the moon begins in clouds to rife; âThe brightening stars increase within the skies; âThe winds are hush; the dews distil; and sleep âHath clos'd the eyelids of my weary sheep: âI only with the proling wolf constrain'd âAll night to wake: with hunger is he pain'd, âAnd I, with love. His hunger he may tame; âBut who can quench, O cruel Love, thy flame? âWhilom did I, all as this poplar fair, âUp-raise my heedless head, then void of care, â'Mong rustick routs the chief for wanton game; âNor could they merry-make, 'till Lobbin came. âWho better seen than I in shepherds' arts, âTo please the lads, and win the lasses' hearts? âHow deftly, to mine oaten reed so sweet, âWont they, upon the green, to shift their feet? âAnd, wearyed in the dance, how would they yearn âSome well devised tale from me to learn? âFor many songs and tales of mirth had I, âTo chase the loitering sun adown the sky: âBut, ah! since Lucy coy deep-wrought her spight âWithin my heart, unmindful of delight âThe jolly grooms I fly, and, all alone, âTo rocks and woods pour forth my fruitless moan. âOh! quit thy wonted scorn, relentless Fair! âE're, ling'ring long, I perish through despair. âHad Rosalind been mistress of my mind, âThough not so fair, she would have prov'd more kind. âO think, unwitting maid, while yet is time, âHow flying years impair the youthful prime! âThy virgin bloom will not for ever stay, âAnd flowers, though left ungath'red, will decay: âThe flowers, anew, returning seasons bring! âBut beauty faded has no second spring. âMy words are wind! She, deaf to all my cries, âTakes pleasure in the mischief of her eyes. âLike frisking heifer, loose in flowery meads, âShe gads where'er her roving fancy leads; âYet still from me. Ah me, the tiresome chace! âShy as the fawn, she flies my fond embrace. âShe flies, indeed, but ever leaves behind, âFly where she will, her likeness in my mind. âNo cruel purpose, in my speed, I bear; â'Tis only love; and love why should'st thou fear? âWhat idle fears a maiden-breast alarm! âStay, simple girl: a lover cannot harm. âTwo sportive kidlings, both fair-fleck'd, I rear; âWhose shooting horns like tender buds appear: âA lambkin too, of spotless fleece, I breed, âAnd teach the fondling from my hand to feed: âNor will I cease betimes to cull the fields âOf every dewy sweet the morning yields: âFrom early spring to autumn late shalt thou âReceive gay girlonds, blooming o'er thy brow: âAnd when,âBut, why these unavailing pains? âThe gifts, alike, and giver, she disdains: âAnd now, left heiress of the glen, she'll deem âMe, londless lad, unworthy her esteem: âYet, was she born, like me, of shepherd-sire; âAnd I may fields and lowing herds acquire. âO! would my gifts but win her wanton heart, âOr could I half the warmth I feel impart, âHow would I wander, every day, to find âThe choice of wildings, blushing through the rind! âFor glossy plumbs how lightsome climb the tree, âHow risque the vengeance of the thrifty Bee! âO! if thou deign to live a shepherdess, âThou Lobbin's flock, and Lobbin, shalt possess: âAnd, fair my flock, nor yet uncomely I, âIf liquid fountains flatter not; and why âShould liquid fountains flatter us, yet show âThe bordering flowers less beauteous than they grow? âO! come, my love; nor think th'imployment mean, âThe dams to milk, and little lambkins wean, âTo drive a-field, by morn, the fattening ewes, âE're the warm sun drink up the cooly dews, âWhile, with my pipe, and with my voice, I chear âEach hour, and through the day detain thine ear. âHow would the crook beseem thy lilly-hand! âHow would my younglings round thee gazing stand! âAh, witless younglings! gaze not on her eye: âThence all my sorrow; thence the death I dy. âO, killing beauty! and O, fore desire! âMust then my sufferings, but with life, expire? âThough blossoms every year the trees adorn, âSpring after spring I wither, nipt with scorn: âNor trow I when this bitter blast will end, âOr if yon stars will e'er my vows befriend. âSleep, sleep, my flock; for happy ye may take âSweet nightly rest, though still your master wake. Now, to the waning moon, the nightingale, In slender warblings, tun'd her piteous tale, The love-sick Shepherd, listening, felt relief, Pleas'd with so sweet a partner in his grief, 'Till, by degrees, her notes and silent night To slumbers soft his heavy heart invite. THE SECOND PASTORAL. Is it not Colinet I lonesome see THENOT, COLINET. THENOT. Is it not Colinet I lonesome see, Leaning with folded arms against the tree? Or is it age of late bedims my sight? 'Tis Colinet, indeed, in woeful plight. Thy cloudy look why melting into tears, Unseemly, now the sky so bright appears? Why in this mournful manner art thou found, Unthankful lad, when all things smile around? Or hear'st not lark and linnet, jointly sing, Their notes blithe-warbling to salute the spring? COLINET. Though blithe their notes, not so my wayward fate; Nor lark would sing, nor linnet, in my state. Each creature, Thenot, to his task is born, As they to mirth and musick, I to mourn. Waking, at midnight, I my woes renew, My tears oft' mingling with the falling dew. THENOT. Small cause, I ween, has lusty youth to plain; Or who may, then, the weight of eld sustain, When every slackening nerve begins to fail, And the load presseth as our days prevail? Yet, though with years my body downward tend, As trees beneath their fruit, in autumn, bend Spite of my snowy head and icy veins, My mind a chearful temper still retains: And why should man, mishap what will, repine, Sour every sweet, and mix with tears his wine? But tell me then: it may relieve thy woe, To let a friend thine inward ailment know. COLINET. Idly 'twill waste thee, Thenot, the whole day, Should'st thou give ear to all my grief can say. Thine ewes will wander; and the heedless lambs, In loud complaints, require their absent dams. THENOT. See Lightfoot; he shall tend them close: and I, 'Tween whiles, across the plain will glance mine eye. COLINET. Where to begin I know not, where to end. Does there one smiling hour my youth attend? Though few my days, as well my follies show, Yet are those days all clouded o'er with woe: No happy gleam of sunshine doth appear, My lowering sky, and wintery months, to chear. My piteous plight in yonder naked tree, Which bears the thunder-scar, too plain I see: Quite destitute it stands of shelter kind, The mark of storms, and sport of every wind: The riven trunk feels not th'approach of spring; Nor birds among the leafless branches sing: No more, beneath thy shade, shall shepherds throng With jocund tale, or pipe, or pleasing song. Ill-fated tree! and more ill-fated I! From thee, from me, alike the shepherds fly. THENOT. Sure thou in hapless hour of time wast born, When blighting mildews spoil the rising corn, Or blasting winds o'er-blossom'd hedge-rows pass, To kill the promis'd fruits, and scorch the grass, Or when the moon, by wizard charm'd, foreshows, Blood-stain'd in foul eclipse, impending woes. Untimely born, ill-luck betides thee still. COLINET. And can there, Thenot, be a greater Ill? THENOT. Nor fox, nor wolf, nor rot among our sheep: From these good shepherd's care his flock may keep: Against ill-luck, alas! all forecast fails; Nor toil by day, nor watch by night, avails. COLINET. Ah me, the while! ah me, the luckless day! Ah luckless lad! befits me more to say. Unhappy hour! when fresh in youthful bud, I left, Sabrina fair, thy silvery flood. Ah, silly I! more silly than my sheep, Which, on thy flowery banks, I wont to keep. Sweet are thy banks! Oh, when shall I, once more, With ravish'd eyes review thine amell'd shore? When, in the crystal of thy water, scan Each feature faded, and my colour wan? When shall I see my hut, the small abode Myself did raise, and cover o'er with sod? Small though it be, a mean and humble cell, Yet is there room for peace, and me, to dwell. THENOT. And what enticement charm'd thee, far away, From thy lov'd home, and led thy heart astray? COLINET. A lewd desire strange lands, and swains, to know: Ah God! that ever I should covet woe. With wandering feet unblest, and fond of fame, I sought I know not what besides a name. THENOT. Or, sooth to say, didst thou not hither rome In search of gains more plenty than at home? A rolling stone is, ever, bare of moss; And, to their cost, green years old proverbs cross. COLINET. Small need there was, in random search of gain, To drive my pining flock athwart the plain, To distant Cam. Fine gain at length, I trow, To hoard up to myself such deal of woe! My sheep quite spent, through travel and ill fare, And, like their keeper, ragged grown and bare, The damp, cold greensward, for my nightly bed, And some slaunt willow's trunk to rest my head. Hard is to bear of pinching cold the pain; And hard is want to the unpracticed swain: But neither want, nor pinching cold, is hard, To blasting storms of calumny compar'd: Unkind as hail it falls; the pelting shower Destroys the tender herb, and budding flower. THENOT. Slander we shepherds count the vilest wrong: And what wounds sorer than an evil tongue? COLINET. Untoward lads, the wanton imps of spite, Make mock of all the ditties I endite. In vain, O Colinet, thy pipe, so shrill, Charms every vale, and gladdens every hill: In vain thou seek'st the coverings of the grove, In the cool shade to sing the pains of love: Sing what thou wilt, ill-nature will prevail; And every elf hath skill enough to rail: But yet, though poor and artless be my vein, Menalcas seems to like my simple strain: And, while that He delighteth in my song, Which to the good Menalcas doth belong, Nor night, nor day, shall my rude musick cease; I ask no more, so I Menalcas please. THENOT. Menalcas, lord of these fair, fertile, plains, Preserves the sheep, and o'er the shepherds reigns: For him our yearly wakes, and feasts, we hold, And choose the fairest firstling from the fold: He, good to all, who Good deserve, shall give Thy flock to feed, and thee at ease to live, Shall curb the malice of unbridled tongues, And bounteously reward thy rural songs. COLINET. First, then, shall lightsome birds forget to fly, The briny ocean turn to pastures dry, And every rapid river cease to flow, 'E're I unmindful of Menalcas grow. THENOT. This night thy care with me forget, and fold Thy flock with mine, to ward th'injurious cold. New milk, and clouted cream, mild cheese and curd, With some remaining fruit of last year's hoard, Shall be our evening fare, and, for the night, Sweet herbs and moss, which gentle sleep invite: And now behold the sun's departing ray, O'er yonder hill, the sign of ebbing day: With songs the jovial hinds return from plow; And unyok'd heifers, loitering homeward, low. THE THIRD PASTORAL. When Virgil thought no shame ALBINO. When Virgil thought no shame the Dorick reed To tune, and flocks on Mantuan plains to feed, With young Augustus' name he grac'd his song: And Spenser, when amid the rural throng He carol'd sweet, and graz'd along the flood Of gentle Thames, made every founding wood With good Eliza's name to ring around; Eliza's name on every tree was found: Since then, through Anna's cares at ease we live, And see our cattle unmolested thrive, While from our Albion her victorious arms Drive wasteful warfare, loud in dire alarms, Like them will I my slender musick raise, And teach the vocal valleys Anna's praise. Mean-time, on oaten pipe a lowly lay, As my kids browse, obscure in shades I play: Yet, not obscure, while Dorset thinks no scorn To visit woods, and swains ignobly born. Two valley swains, both musical, both young, In friendship mutual, and united long, Retire within a mossy cave, to shun The crowd of shepherds, and the noon-day sun. A gloom of sadness overcasts their mind: Revolving now, the solemn day they find, When young Albino died. His image dear Bedews their cheeks with many a trickling tear: To tears they add the tribute of their verse; These Angelot, those Palin, did rehearse. ANGELOT. Thus, yearly circling, by-past times return; And yearly, thus, Albino's death we mourn. Sent into life, alas! how short thy stay: How sweet the rose! how speedy to decay! Can we forget, Albino dear, thy knell, Sad-sounding wide from every village-bell? Can we forget how sorely Albion moan'd, That hills, and dales, and rocks, in echo groan'd, Presaging future woe, when, for our crimes, We lost Albino, pledge of peaceful times, Fair boast of this fair Island, darling joy Of Nobles high, and every shepherd-boy? No joyous pipe was hear'd, no flocks were seen, Nor shepherd found upon the grassy green, No cattle graz'd the field, nor drank the flood, No birds were hear'd to warble through the wood. In yonder gloomy grove out-stretch'd he lay, His lovely limbs upon the dampy clay; On his cold cheek the rosy hue decay'd, And, o'er his lips, the deadly blue display'd: Bleating around him ly his plaintive sheep; And mourning shepherds come, in crowds, to weep. Young Buckhurst comes: and, is there no redress? As if the grave regarded our distress! The tender virgins come, to tears yet new, And give, aloud, the lamentations due. The pious mother comes, with grief opprest: Ye trees, and conscious fountains, can attest With what sad accents, and what piercing cries, She fill'd the grove, and importun'd the skies, And every star upbraided with his death, When, in her widowed arms, devoid of breath, She clasp'd her son: nor did the Nymph, for this, Place in her dearling's welfare all her bliss, Him teaching, young, the harmless crook to wield, And rule the peaceful empire of the field. As milk-white swans on streams of silver show, And silvery streams to grace the meadows flow, As corn the vales, and trees the hills adorn, So thou, to thine, an ornament wast born. Since thou, delicious youth, didst quit the plains, Th'ungrateful ground we till with fruitless pains, In labour'd furrows sow the choice of wheat, And, over empty sheaves, in harvest sweat, A thin increase our fleecy cattle yield; And thorns, and thistles, overspread the field. How all our hope is fled, like morning-dew! And scarce did we thy dawn of manhood view. Who, now, shall teach the pointed spear to throw, To whirl the sling, and bend the stubborn bow, To toss the quoit with steady aim, and far, With sinewy force, to pitch the massy bar? Nor dost thou live to bless thy mother's days, To share her triumphs, and to feel her praise, In foreign realms to purchase early fame, And add new glories to the British name: O, peaceful may thy gentle spirit rest! The flowery turf ly light upon thy breast; Nor shrieking owl, nor bat, thy tomb fly round, Nor midnight goblins revel o'er the ground. PALIN. No more, mistaken Angelot, complain: Albino lives; and all our tears are vain: Albino lives, and will, for ever live With Myriads mixt, who never know to grieve, Who welcome every stranger-guest, nor fear Ever to mourn his absence with a tear, Where cold, nor heat, nor irksome toil annoy, Nor age, nor sickness, comes to damp their joy: And now the royal Nymph, who bore him, deigns The land to rule, and shield the simple swains, While, from above, propitious he looks down: For this, the welkin does no longer frown, Each planet shines, indulgent, from his sphere, And we renew our pastimes with the year. Hills, dales, and woods, with shrilling pipes resound; The boys and virgins dance, with chaplets crown'd, And hail Albino blest: the valleys ring Albino blest! O now, if ever, bring The laurel green, the smelling eglantine, And tender branches from the mantling vine, The dewy cowslip, which in meadow grows, The fountain-violet, and the garden-rose, Marsh-lillies sweet, and tufts of daffadil, With what ye cull from wood, or verdant hill, Whether in open sun, or shade, they blow, More early some, and some unfolding slow, Bring, in heap'd canisters, of every kind, As if the summer had with spring combin'd, And nature, forward to assist your care, Did no profusion for Albino spare. Your hamlets strew, and every publick way; And consecrate to mirth Albino's day: Myself will lavish all my little store, And deal about the goblet flowing o'er: Old Moulin there shall harp, young Myco sing, And Cuddy dance the round amid the ring, And Hobbinol his antic gambols play: To thee these honours, yearly, will we pay; Nor fail to mention thee in all our chear, And teach our children the remembrance dear, When we or shearing-feast, or harvest, keep, To speed the plow, and bless our thriving sheep. While willow kids, and herbage lambs, pursue, While bees love thyme, and locusts sip the dew, While birds delight in woods their notes to strain, Thy name and sweet memorial shall remain. THE FOURTH PASTORAL. This place may seem for shepherd's leisure made MYCO, ARGOL. MYCO. This place may seem for shepherd's leisure made, So close these elms inweave their lofty shade; The twining woodbine, how it climbs! to breathe Refreshing sweets around on all beneath; The ground with grass of chearful green bespread, Through which the springing flower up-rears the head: Lo, here the kingcup of a golden hue, Medly'd with daisies white and endive blue, And honeysuckles of a purply dy, Confusion gay! bright-waving to the eye. Hark, how they warble in that brambly bush, The gaudy goldfinch and the speckly thrush, The linnet green, with others famed for skill, And blackbird fluting through his yellow bill: In sprightly concert how they all combine, Us prompting in the various song to join: Up, Argol, then, and to thy lip apply Thy mellow pipe, or voice more sounding try: And since our ewes have graz'd, what harm if they Ly round and listen while the lambkins play? ARGOL. Well, Myco, can thy dainty wit express Fair nature's bounties in the fairest dress: 'Tis rapture all! the place, the birds, the sky; And rapture works the finger's fancy high. Sweet breathe the fields, and now a gentle breez Moves every leaf, and trembles through the trees: Ill such incitements suit my rugged lay, Befitting more the Musick thou can'st play. MYCO. No skill of musick kon I, simple swain, No fine device thine ear to entertain: Albeit some deal I pipe, rude though it be, Sufficient to divert my sheep and me; Yet Colinet (and Colinet hath skill) Oft' guides my fingers on the tuneful quill, And fain would teach me on what sounds to dwell, And where to sink a note, and where to swell. ARGOL. Ah, Myco! half my flock would I bestow, Should Colinet to me his cunning show: So trim his sonnets are, I pr'ythee, swain, Now give us, once, a sample of his strain: For wonders of that lad the shepherds say, How sweet his pipe, how ravishing his lay! The sweetness of his pipe and lay rehearse; And ask what Boon thou willest for thy verse. MYCO. Since then thou list, a mournful song I chuse: A mournful song relieves a mournfull Muse. Fast by the river on a bank he sate, To weep the lovely maid's untimely fate, Fair Stella hight: a lovely maid was she, Whose fate he wept, a faithful shepherd he. Awake, my pipe; in every note express Fair Stella's death, and Colinet's distress. âO woeful day! O day of woe to me! âThat ever I should live such day to see! âThat ever she could dy! O most unkind, âTo go and leave thy Colinet behind! âFrom blameless love and plighted troth to go, âAnd leave to Colinet a life of woe! Awake, my pipe; in every note express Fair Stella's death, and Colinet's distress. âAnd yet, why blame I her? Full fain would she âWith dying arms have clasp'd herself to me; âI clasp'd her too, but death prov'd over-strong; âNor vows nor tears could fleeting life prolong: âYet how shall I from vows and tears refrain? âAnd why should vows, alas! and tears be vain? Awake, my pipe; in every note express Fair Stella's death, and Colinet's distress. âAid me to grieve, with bleating moan, my sheep; âAid me, thou ever-flowing stream, to weep; âAid me ye faint, ye hollow, winds, to sigh, âAnd thou, my woe, assist me thou to dy. âMe flock nor stream, nor winds nor woes, relieve; âShe lov'd through life, and I through life will grieve. Awake, my pipe; in every note express Fair Stella's death, and Colinet's distress. âYe gentler maids, companions of my fair, âWith down cast look, and with dishevell'd hair, âAll beat the breast, and wring your hands and moan; âHer hour, untimely, might have prov'd your own: âHer hour, untimely, help me to lament; âAnd let your hearts at Stella's name relent. Awake, my pipe; in every note express Fair Stella's death, and Colinet's distress. âIn vain the indearing luster of your eyes âWe dote upon, and you as vainly prize. âWhat though your beauty bless the faithful swain, âAnd in the enamour'd heart like queens ye reign; âYet in their prime does death the fairest kill, âAs ruthless winds the tender blossoms spill. Awake, my pipe; in every note express Fair Stella's death, and Colinet's distress. âSuch Stella was; yet Stella might not live! âAnd what could Colinet in ransom give? âOh! if or musick's voice, or beauty's charm, âCould milden death, and stay his lifted arm, âMy pipe her face, her face my pipe might save, âRedeeming each the other from the grave. Awake, my pipe; in every note express Fair Stella's death, and Colinet's distress. âAh, fruitless wish! fell death's uplifted arm âNor beauty can arrest, nor musick charm. âBehold! Oh baleful sight! see where she lies! âThe budding flower, unkindly blasted, dies: âNor, though I live the longest day to mourn, âWill she again to life and me return. Awake, my pipe; in every note express Fair Stella's death, and Colinet's distress. âUnhappy Colinet! what boots thee now, âTo weave fresh girlonds for thy Stella's brow? âNo girlond ever more may Stella wear, âNor see the flowery season of the year, âNor dance nor sing, nor ever sweetly smile, âAnd every toil of Colinet beguile. Awake, my pipe; in every note express Fair Stella's death, and Colinet's distress. âThrow by the lilly, daffadil, and rose; âWreaths of black yew, and willow pale, compose, âWith baneful hemlock, deadly nightshade, dress'd, âSuch chaplets as may witness thine unrest, âIf aught can witness: O, ye shepherds tell, âWhen I am dead, no shepherd lov'd so well! Awake, my pipe; in every note express Fair Stella's death, and Colinet's distress. âAlack, my sheep! and thou, dear spotless lamb, âBy Stella nurs'd, who wean'd thee from the dam, âWhat heed give I to aught but to my grief, âMy whole employment, and my whole relief! âStray where ye list, some happyer master try: âYet once, my flock, was none so bless'd as I. Awake, my pipe; in every note express Fair Stella's death, and Colinet's distress. âMy pipe whose soothing sound could passion move, âAnd first taught Stella's virgin-heart to love, âShall silent hang upon this blasted oak, âWhence owls their dirges sing, and ravens croak: âNor lark, nor linnet, shall by day delight, âNor nightingale suspend my moan by night. âThe night and day shall undistinguish'd be, âAlike to Stella, and alike to me. No more, my pipe; here cease we to express Fair Stella's death, and Colinet's distress. Thus, sorrowing, did the gentle shepherd sing, And urge the valley with his wail to ring. And now that sheep-hook for my song I crave. ARGOL. Not this, but one more costly, shalt thou have, Of season'd elm, where studs of brass appear, To speak the giver's name, the month, and year; The hook of polish'd steel, the handle torn'd, And richly by the carver's skill adorn'd. O Colinet, how sweet thy grief to hear! How does thy verse subdue the listening ear! Soft falling as the still, refreshing, dew, To slake the drought, and herbage to renew: Not half so sweet the midnight winds, which move In drousy murmurs o'er the waving grove, Nor valley brook that, hid by alders, speeds O'er pebbles warbling, and thro' whisp'ring reeds, Nor dropping waters, which from rocks distil, And welly grots with tinkling echoes fill. Thrice happy Colinet, who can relieve Heart-anguish sore, and make it sweet to grieve! And next to thee shall Myco bear the bell, Who can repeat thy peerless song so well: But see! the hills increasing shadows cast; The sun, I ween, is leaving us in haste: His weakly rays faint glimmer through the wood, And bluey mists arise from yonder flood. MYCO. Bid then our dogs to gather in the sheep. Good shepherds, with their flock, betimes should sleep. Who late lies down, thou know'st, as late will rise, And, sluggard-like, to noon-day snoring lies, While in the fold his injur'd ewes complain, And after dewy pastures bleat in vain. THE FIFTH PASTORAL. In rural strains we first our musick try CUDDY. In rural strains we first our musick try, And bashful into woods and thickets fly, Mistrusting then our skill; yet if through time Our voice, improving, gain a pitch sublime, Thy growing virtues, Sackville, shall engage My riper verse, and more aspiring age. The sun, now mounted to the noon of day, Began to shoot direct his burning ray; When, with the flocks, their feeders sought the shade A venerable oak wide-spreading made: What should they do to pass the loitering time? As fancy led, each form'd his tale in rhyme: And some the joys, and some the pains, of love, And some to set out strange adventures, strove, The trade of wizard's some, and Merlin's skill, And whence, to charms, such empire o'er the will. Then Cuddy last (who Cuddy can excel In neat device?) his tale began to tell. âWhen shepherds flourish'd in Eliza's reign, âThere liv'd in high repute a jolly swain, âYoung Colin Clout; who well could pipe and sing, âAnd by his notes invite the lagging spring. âHe, as his custom was, at leisure laid âIn woodland bower, without a rival play'd, âSoliciting his pipe to warble clear, âEnchantment sweet as ever wont to hear âBelated wayfarers, from wake or fair âDetain'd by musick, hovering on in air: âDrawn by the magick of the inticing sound, âWhat troops of mute admirers flock'd around! âThe steerlings left their food; and creatures, wild âBy nature form'd, insensibly grew mild. âHe makes the gathering birds about him throng, âAnd loads the neighbouring branches with his song: âThere, with the crowd, a nightingale of fame, âJealous, and fond of praise, to listen came: âShe turn'd her ear, and pause by pause, with pride, âLike echo to the shepherd's pipe reply'd. âThe shepherd hear'd with wonder, and again, âTo try her more, renew'd his various strain: âTo all the various strain she plies her throat, âAnd adds peculiar grace to every note. âIf Colin, in complaining accent grieve, âOr brisker motion to his measure give, âIf gentle sounds he modulate, or strong, âShe, not a little vain, repeats the song: âBut so repeats, that Colin half despis'd âHis pipe and skill, around the country priz'd: âAnd sweetest songster of the winged kind, âWhat thanks, said he, what praises shall I find âTo equal thy melodious voice? In thee âThe rudeness of my rural fife I see; âFrom thee I learn no more to vaunt my skill: âAloft in air she sate, provoking still âThe vanquish'd swain. Provok'd, at last, he strove âTo shew the little minstrel of the grove âHis utmost powers, determin'd once to try âHow art, exerting, might with nature vy; âFor vy could none with either in their part, âWith her in nature, nor with him in art. âHe draws in breath, his rising breast to fill: âThroughout the wood his pipe is hear'd to shrill. âFrom note to note, in haste, his fingers fly; âStill more and more the numbers multiply: âAnd now they trill, and now they fall and rise, âAnd swift and slow they change with sweet surprise. âAttentive she doth scarce the sounds retain; âBut to herself first conns the puzzling strain, âAnd tracing, heedful, note by note repays âThe shepherd in his own harmonious lays, âThrough every changing cadence runs at length, âAnd adds in sweetness what she wants in strength; âThen Colin threw his fife disgrac'd aside, âWhile she loud triumph sings, proclaiming wide âHer mighty conquest, and within her throat âTwirls many a wild unimitable note, âTo foil her rival. What could Colin more? âA little harp of maple-ware he bore: âThe little harp was old, but newly strung, âWhich, usual, he across his shoulders hung. âNow take, delightful bird, my last farewel, âHe said, and learn from hence thou dost excel âNo trivial artist: and anon he wound âThe murmuring strings, and order'd every sound: âThen earnest to his instrument he bends, âAnd both hands pliant on the strings extends: âHis touch the strings obey, and various move, âThe lower answering still to those above: âHis fingers, restless, traverse to and fro, âAs in pursuit of harmony they go: âNow lightly skimming, o'er the strings they pass, âLike winds which gently brush the plying grass, âWhile melting airs arise at their command: âAnd now, laborious, with a weighty hand âHe sinks into the cords, with solemn pace, âTo give the swelling tones a bolder grace; âAnd now the left, and now by turns the right, âEach other chafe, harmonious both in flight: âThen his whole fingers blend a swarm of sounds, âTill the sweet tumult through the harp redounds. âCease, Colin, cease, thy rival cease to vex; âThe mingling notes, alas! her ear perplex: âShe warbles, diffident, in hope and fear, âAnd hits imperfect accents here and there, âAnd fain would utter forth some double tone, âWhen soon she falters, and can utter none: âAgain she tries, and yet again she fails; âFor still the harp's united power prevails. âThen Colin play'd again, and playing sung: âShe, with the fatal love of glory stung, âHears all in pain: her heart begins to swell: âIn piteous notes she sighs, in notes which tell âHer bitter anguish: he, still singing, plies âHis limber joints; her sorrows higher rise. âHow shall she bear a conqueror, who, before, âNo equal through the grove in musick bore? âShe droops, she hangs her flagging wings, she moans, âAnd fetcheth from her breast melodious groans. âOppress'd with grief at last too great to quell, âDown, breathless, on the guilty harp she fell. âThen Colin loud lamented o'er the dead, âAnd unavailing tears profusely shed, âAnd broke his wicked strings, and curs'd his skill; âAnd best to make attonement for the ill, âIf, for such ill, attonement might be made, âHe builds her tomb beneath a laurel shade, âThen adds a verse, and sets with flowers the ground, âAnd makes a fence of winding osiers round. âA verse and tomb is all I now can give; âAnd here thy name at least, he said, shall live. Thus ended Cuddy with the setting sun, And, by his tale, unenvy'd praises won. THE SIXTH PASTORAL. How still the sea behold! how calm the sky! GERON, HOBBINOL, LANQUET. GERON. How still the sea behold! how calm the sky! And how, in sportive chase, the swallows fly! My goats, secure from harm, small tendance need, While high, on yonder hanging rock, they feed: And, here below, the banky shore along, Your heifers graze. Now, then, to strive in song Prepare. As eldest, Hobbinol begin; And Lanquet's rival-verse, by turns, come in. HOBBINOL. Let others stake what chosen pledge they will, Or kid, or lamb, or mazer wrought with skill: For praise we sing, nor wager ought beside; And, whose the praise, let Geron's lips decide. LANQUET. To Geron I my voice, and skill, commend, A candid umpire, and to both a friend. GERON. Begin then, boys; and vary well your song: Begin; nor fear, from Geron's sentence, wrong. A boxen hautboy, loud, and sweet of sound, All varnish'd, and with brazen ringlets bound, I to the victor give: no mean reward, If to the ruder village-pipes compar'd. HOBBINOL. The snows are melted; and the kindly rain Descends on every herb, and every grain: Soft balmy breezes breathe along the sky; The bloomy season of the year is nigh. LANQUET. The cuckoo calls aloud his wandering love; The turtle's moan is hear'd in every grove; The pastures change; the warbling linnets sing: Prepare to welcome in the gaudy spring. HOBBINOL. When locusts, in the ferny bushes, cry, When ravens pant, and snakes in caverns ly, Graze then in woods, and quit the shadeless plain, Else shall ye press the spungy teat in vain. LANQUET. When greens to yellow vary, and ye see The ground bestrew'd with fruits off every tree, And stormy winds are hear'd, think winter near, Nor trust too far to the declining year. HOBBINOL. Woe then, alack! befall the spendthrift swain, When frost, and snow, and hail, and sleet, and rain, By turns chastise him, while, through little care, His sheep, unshelter'd, pine in nipping air. LANQUET. The lad of forecast then untroubled sees The white-bleak plains, and silvery frosted trees: He fends his flock, and, clad in homely frize, In his warm cott the wintery blast defies. HOBBINOL. Full fain, O bless'd Eliza! would I praise Thy maiden rule, and Albion's golden days: Then gentle Sidney liv'd, the shepherd's friend: Eternal blessings on his shade attend! LANQUET. Thrice happy shepherds now! for Dorset loves The country-muse, and our resounding groves, While Anna reigns: O, ever, may she reign! And bring, on earth, the golden age again. HOBBINOL. I love, in secret all, a beauteous maid, And have my love, in secret all, repaid; This coming night she plights her troth to me: Divine her name, and thou the victor be. LANQUET. Mild as the lamb, unharmful as the dove, True as the turtle, is the maid I love: How we in secret love, I shall not say: Divine her name, and I give up the day. HOBBINOL. Soft on a cowslip-bank my love and I Together lay; a brook ran murmuring by: A thousand tender things to me she said; And I a thousand tender things repaid. LANQUET. In summer-shade, behind the cocking hay, What kind endearing words did she not say! Her lap, with apron deck'd, she fondly spread, And strok'd my cheek, and lull'd my leaning head. HOBBINOL. Breathe soft ye winds; ye waters gently flow; Shield her ye trees; ye flowers around her grow: Ye swains, I beg ye, pass in silence by; My love, in yonder vale, asleep does ly. LANQUET. Once Delia slept on easy moss reclin'd, Her lovely limbs half bare, and rude the wind: I smooth'd her coats, and stole a silent kiss: Condemn me, shepherds, if I did amiss. HOBBINOL. As Marian bath'd, by chance I passed by; She blush'd, and at me glanc'd a sidelong eye: Then, cowering in the treacherous stream, she try'd Her tempting form, yet still in vain, to hide. LANQUET. As I, to cool me, bath'd one sultry day, Fond Lydia, lurking, in the sedges lay: The wanton laugh'd, and seem'd in haste to fly, Yet oft' she stopp'd, and oft' she turn'd her eye. HOBBINOL. When first I saw, would I had never seen, Young Lyset lead the dance on yonder green, Intent upon her beauties, as she mov'd, Poor heedless wretch! at unawares I lov'd. LANQUET. When Lucy decks with flowers her swelling breast, And on her elbow leans, dissembling rest, Unable to refrain my madding mind, Nor herds, nor pasture, worth my care I find. HOBBINOL. Come, Rosalind, O, come! for, wanting thee, Our peopled vale a desert is to me. Come, Rosalind, O, come! My brinded kine, My snowy sheep, my farm, and all, are thine. LANQUET. Come, Rosalind, O, come! Here shady bowers, Here are cool fountains, and here springing flowers: Come, Rosalind! Here ever let us stay, And sweetly waste the live-long time away. HOBBINOL. In vain the seasons of the moon I know, The force of healing herbs, and where they grow: No herb there is, no season, to remove From my fond heart the racking pains of love. LANQUET. What profits me, that I in charms have skill, And ghosts, and goblins, order as I will, Yet have, with all my charms, no power to lay The sprite that breaks my quiet night and day? HOBBINOL. O that, like Colin, I had skill in rhimes, To purchase credit with succeeding times! Sweet Colin Clout! who never, yet, had peer; Who sung through all the seasons of the year. LANQUET. Let me, like Merlin, sing: his Voice had power To free the 'clipsing moon at midnight hour: And, as he sung, the fairies with their queen, In mantles blue, came tripping o'er the green. HOBBINOL. Last eve of May did I not hear them sing, And see their dance? And I can shew the ring, Where, hand in hand, they shift their feet so light: The grass springs greener from their tread by night. LANQUET. But hast thou seen their king, in rich array, Fam'd Oberon, with damask'd robe so gay, And gemmy crown, by moonshine sparkling far, And azure scepter, pointed with a star? GERON. Here end your pleasing strife. Both victors are; And both with Colin may, in rhyme, compare. A boxen hautboy, loud, and sweet of sound, All varnish'd, and with brazen ringlets bound, To each I give. A mizling mist descends Adown that steepy rock: and this way tends Yon distant rain. Shoreward the vessels strive; And, see, the boys their flocks to shelter drive. THE STRAY NYMPH Cease your musick, gentle swains: Saw ye Delia cross the plains? Every thicket, every grove, Have I ranged, to find my love: A kid, a lamb, my flock, I give, Tell me only doth she live. White her skin as mountain-snow; In her cheek the roses blow: And her eye is brighter far Than the beamy morning star. When her ruddy lip ye view, 'Tis a berry moist with dew: And her breath, Oh 'tis a gale Passing o'er a fragant vale, Passing, when a friendly shower Freshens every herb and flower. Wide her bosom opens, gay As the primrose-dell in May, Sweet as violet-borders growing Over fountains ever-flowing. Like the tendrels of the vine, Do her auburn tresses twine, Glossy ringlets all behind Streaming buxom to the wind, When along the lawn she bounds, Light, as hind before the hounds: And the youthful ring she fires, Hopeless in their fond desires, As her flitting feet advance, Wanton in the winding dance. Tell me, shepherds, have ye seen My delight, my love, my queen? THE HAPPY SWAIN Have ye seen the morning sky, When the dawn prevails on high, When, anon, some purply ray Gives a sample of the day, When, anon, the lark, on wing, Strives to soar, and strains to sing? Have ye seen the ethereal blue Gently shedding silvery dew, Spangling o'er the silent green, While the nightingale, unseen, To the moon and stars, full bright, Lonesome chants the hymn of night? Have ye seen the broid'red May All her scented bloom display, Breezes opening, every hour, This, and that, expecting flower, While the mingling birds prolong, From each bush, the vernal song? Have ye seen the damask-rose Her unsully'd blush disclose, Or the lilly's dewy bell, In her glossy white, excell, Or a garden vary'd o'er With a thousand glories more? By the beauties these display, Morning, evening, night, or day, By the pleasures these excite, Endless sources of delight! Judge, by them, the joys I find, Since my Rosalind was kind, Since she did herself resign To my vows, for ever mine. EPISTLES LAMENT FOR QUEEN MARY. O Albion mourn! And let not the least Smile Be on the Face of this unhappy Isle. Weep all ye Rocks, and let your Fountains flow, Sobbing and murmuring, o're the Plains below. Let the laborious Hinds leave Tillage now, And free the Heifer from the useless Plough: No longer let th'advent'rous Merchant roam, Round the wide World, to bring rich Treasures home: Let both the Indies keep their precious Store; We have no longer use for Gums or Oar: She, to enrich whose Altars they were drain'd, Is now no more! The gentle Venus of our Isle is gone, By Subjects' Crimes forc'd from her Earthly Throne; In haste She went, and left our Mars alone. So, when of old, the World Licentious grew, And nought but Vice with Passion did persue, Astrea took her much-lamented Flight To purer Regions of Eternal Light. Great was their Loss; but Greater We sustain; For in our Goddess did All Vertues reign. Then let our Sorrow Universal be, And Thou, my Muse, in doleful Elegy (If Sobbing will permit thy Verse to flow) Tell the sad Story of our present Woe. How unexpected and how soon She fell! The Pride of Earth, her Sexes Miracle: Sure so Divine a Soul ne're yet came down To wear a Veil of Flesh, and Mortal Crown: Such was the Form of Eve, e'er Envious sin Soil'd the Fair Frame, and tainted all Within. The Cyprian Dame for Beauty was renown'd, And wise Minerva was with Knowledge crown'd; But both Perfections in our Deity United, made a full Divinity. To the Grave Senate She could Counsel give, Which with Astonishment they did receive: Well was She skill'd in Depths of Policie, Could the great Ills in Government foresee. Her Crown She wore with no Affected State; Nor did Her Great Perfections Pride create: She'd condescend, yet lose no Majesty, And be Majestick with Humility; Familiar, yet not Fond; free of Access, But yet not Mean for all her Easiness. Such different Notes, when they in One agree, Must needs produce Amazing Harmony. 'Tis well we know not how our Loss to rate; Oh! We should sink beneath our Weighty Fate. He whom the Terrours of a bloody Fight, Nor all the ghastly Forms of Death can fright, Nor the loud Cannon's Roar can terrifie, Falls from the Grandeur of His Majesty. Tears from his swelling Eyes profusely flow, And the Great Conquerour lies Prostrate low, To see his Consort ravish'd from his Arms, And Death triumphing o're her beauteous Charms. Thus have I seen a well-grown Oak contend With all the boist'rous Storms the North cou'd send, And with its stubborn stedfast Trunk outbrave The Fury of the Winds, when most they'd rave; At last a pointed Bolt the Thund'rer darts, At which its groaning Body 'sunder parts, Unable to resist the mighty Wound It's Airy Top is level'd with the Ground. See PhÅbus now (as once for Phaeton) Has mask'd his Face, and put deep Mourning on; Dark Clouds his sable Chariot do surround, And the dull Steeds stalk o're the Melancholy Round. Night with her Sooty Wings o'rcomes the Day; Triumphant Sorrow drives each Joy away: All Nature groans! The hollow Winds do sigh, As tho' the Final Scene were drawing nigh. And sure it is. . . . For now the Life of All Is gone. All that we Good or Lovely call. Then welcome Chaos and Eternal Night! For who would now behold th'Ungrateful Light? It yields no pleasing Object, no Delight. But Hark! . . . sure 'tis her Charming Voice I hear! Or is't my Fancy, that deludes my Ear? No; 'tis the same; there's Music in the sound, Such as of Old the watchful Shepherds found, When Angels sang the Birth of that Great King, That did Redemption to Lost Mankind bring: Joy it proclaims throughout each British Plain, And bids us hope for Sun-shine days again. Look down, Bless'd Saint, with Pity then look down, And ease the Burden of thy Partner's Crown: Do Thou who did'st on Earth our Princess reign, Our Guardian Angel still above remain: Shed on this Land thy Kinder Influence; And guide us through these Mists of Providence, In which we stray, unable to foresee The Dark Resolves of Sullen Destiny. Ambr. Phillips of St. John's College TO A FRIEND WHO Desired me to write on the Death of King William. April 20, 1702. Trust me, dear George, could I in verse but show What sorrow I, what sorrow all men, owe To Nassau's fate, or could I hope to raise A song proportion'd to the Monarch's praise, Could I his merits, or my grief, express, And proper thoughts in proper language dress, Unbidden should my pious numbers flow, The tribute of a heart o'ercharg'd with woe; But, rather than prophane his sacred herse With languid praises and unhallow'd verse, My sighs I to myself in silence keep, And inwardly, with secret anguish, weep. Let Halifax's Muse (he knew him well) His virtues to succeeding ages tell. Let him, who sung the warrior on the Boyne, (Provoking Dorset in the task to join) And shew'd the hero more than man before, Let him th'illustrious mortal's fate deplore; A mournful theme: while, on raw pinions, I But flutter, and make weak attempts to fly: Content, if, to divert my vacant time, I can but like some love-sick fopling rhyme, To some kind-hearted mistress make my court, And, like a modish wit, in sonnet sport. Let others, more ambitious, rack their brains In polish'd sentiments, and labour'd strains: To blooming Phillis I a song compose, And, for a rhyme, compare her to the rose; Then, while my fancy works, I write down morn, To paint the blush that does her cheek adorn, And, when the whiteness of her skin I show, With ecstasy bethink myself of snow. Thus, without pains, I tinkle in the close, And sweeten into verse insipid prose. The country scraper, when he wakes his crowd, And makes the tortur'd cat-gut squeak aloud, Is often ravish'd, and in transport lost: What more, my friend, can fam'd Corelli boast, When harmony herself from heav'n descends, And on the artist's moving bow attends? Why then, in making verses should I strain For wit, and of Apollo beg a vein? Why study Horace and the Stagyrite? Why cramp my dulness, and in torment write? Let me transgress by nature, not by rule, An artless Idiot, not a study'd fool, A Withers, not a Rhymer, since I aim At nothing less, in writing, than a name. From Holland to a Friend in England in the Year 1703. From Utrecht's silent walks, by winds, I send Health and kind wishes to my absent friend. The winter spent, I feel the poet's fire; The sun advances, and the fogs retire: The genial spring unbinds the frozen earth, Dawns on the trees, and gives the primrose birth. Loos'd from their friendly harbours, once again Confederate fleets assemble on the main: The voice of war the gallant soldier wakes; And weeping CloÃ« parting kisses takes. On new-plum'd wings the Roman eagle soars; The Belgick lion in full fury roars. Dispatch the leader from your happy coast, The hope of Europe, and Britannia's boast: O Marlborouh come! fresh laurels for thee rise! One conquest more; and Gallia will grow wise. Old Lewis makes his last effort in arms, And shews how, even in age, ambition charms. Meanwhile, my friend, the thick'ning shades I haunt, And smooth canals, and after rivulets pant: The smooth canals, alas, too lifeless show! Nor to the eye, nor to the ear, they flow. Studious of ease, and fond of humble things, Below the smiles, below the frowns of kings, Thanks to my stars, I prize the sweets of life: No sleepless nights I count, no days of strife. Content to live, content to dy, unknown, Lord of myself, accountable to none; I sleep, I wake, I drink; I sometimes love; I read, I write; I settle, and I rove, When, and where-e'er, I please: thus, every hour Gives some new proof of my despotick power. All, that I will, I can; but then, I will As reason bids; I meditate no ill; And, pleas'd with things which in my level ly, Leave it to madmen o'er the clouds to fly. But this is all romance, a dream to you, Who fence and dance, and keep the court in view. White staffs and truncheons, seals and golden keys, And silver stars, your tow'ring genius please: Such manly thoughts in ev'ry infant rise, Who daily for some tinsel trinket cries. Go on, and prosper, Sir: but first from me Learn your own temper; for I know you free. You can be honest; but you cannot bow, And cringe, beneath a supercilious brow: You cannot fawn; your stubborn soul recoils At baseness; and your blood too highly boils. From nature some submissive tempers have; Unkind to you, she form'd you not a slave. A courtier must be supple, full of guile, Must learn to praise, to flatter, to revile, The good, the bad, an enemy, a friend, To give false hopes, and on false hopes depend. Go on, and prosper, Sir: but learn to hide Your upright spirit: 'twill be construed pride. The splendor of a court is all a cheat; You must be servile, 'e're you can be great. Besides, your ancient patrimony wasted, Your youth run out, your schemes of grandeur blasted, You may perhaps retire in discontent, And curse your patron, for no strange event: The patron will his innocence protest, And frown in earnest, though he smil'd in jest. Man, only from himself, can suffer wrong; His reason fails, as his desires grow strong: Hence, wanting ballast, and too full of sail, He lies expos'd to ev'ry rising gale. From youth to age, for happiness he's bound: He splits on rocks, or runs his bark a-ground, Or, wide of land, a desert ocean views, And, to the last, the flying port pursues, Yet, to the last, the port he does not gain, And dying finds, too late, he liv'd in vain. TO THE EARL of DORSET Copenhagen, March 9, 1709. From frozen climes, and endless tracts of snow, From streams which northern winds forbid to flow, What present shall the muse to Dorset bring, Or how, so near the pole, attempt to sing? The hoary winter here conceals from sight All pleasing objects which to verse invite. The hills and dales, and the delightful woods, The flow'ry plains, and silver-streaming floods, By snow disguis'd, in bright confusion ly, And with one dazzling waste fatigue the eye. No gentle breathing breez prepares the spring, No birds within the desert region sing. The ships, unmov'd, the boist'rous winds defy, While rattling chariots o'er the ocean fly. The vast Leviathan wants room to play, And spout his waters in the face of day. The starving wolves along the main sea prowl, And to the moon in icy valleys howl. O'er many a shining league the level main Here spreads itself into a glassy plain: There solid billows of enormous size, Alps of green ice, in wild disorder rise. And yet but lately have I seen, ev'n here, The winter in a lovely dress appear. 'E're yet the clouds let fall the treasur'd snow, Or winds begun through hazy skies to blow, At ev'ning a keen eastern breez arose, And the descending rain unsully'd froze. Soon as the silent shades of night withdrew, The ruddy morn disclos'd at once to view The face of nature in a rich disguise, And brighten'd ev'ry object to my eyes: For ev'ry shrub, and ev'ry blade of grass, And ev'ry pointed thorn, seem'd wrought in glass; In pearls and rubies rich the hawthorns show, While through the ice the crimson berries glow. The thick-sprung reeds, which watry marshes yield, Seem'd polish'd lances in a hostile field. The stag in limpid currents, with surprise, Sees crystal branches on his forehead rise: The spreading oak, the beech, and tow'ring pine, Glaz'd over, in the freezing Ã¦ther shine. The frighted birds the rattling branches shun, Which wave and glitter in the distant sun. When if a sudden gust of wind arise, The brittle forest into atoms flies, The crackling wood beneath the tempest bends, And in a spangled show'r the prospect ends: Or, if a southern gale the region warm, And by degrees unbind the wintry charm, The traveller a miry country sees, And journies sad beneath the dropping trees: Like some deluded peasant, Merlin leads Through fragrant bow'rs, and thro' delicious meads, While here inchanted gardens to him rise, And airy fabricks there attract his eyes, His wandring feet the magick paths pursue, And while he thinks the fair illusion true, The trackless scenes disperse in fluid air, And woods, and wilds, and thorny ways appear, A tedious road the weary wretch returns, And, as he goes, the transient vision mourns. To the Right Honourable Charles Lord Halifax, one of the Lords Justices appointed by His Majesty. Ut Mater Juvenem, quem Notus invido Flatu Carpathii trans Maris Ã¦quora Cunctantem spatio longius annuo Dulci distinet Ã  domo; Votis omnibus Hunc &amp; precibus vocat, Curvo nec faciem littore demovet: Sic desideriis icta fidelibus QuÃ¦rit Patria CÃ¦sarem. Hor. 1714. Patron of verse, O Halifax, attend, The muse's fav'rite, and the poet's friend! Approaching joys my ravish'd thoughts inspire: I feel the transport; and my soul's on fire! Again Britannia rears her awful head: Her fears, transplanted, to her foes are fled. Again her standard she displays to view; And all its faded lillies bloom anew. Here beauteous Liberty salutes the sight, Still pale, nor yet recover'd of her fright, Whilst here Religion, smiling to the skies, Her thanks expresses with up-lifted eyes. But who advances next, with chearful grace, Joy in her eye, and plenty in her face? A wheaten garland does her head adorn, O Property! O goddess, English-born! Where hast thou been? How did the wealthy mourn! The bankrupt nation sigh'd for thy return, Doubtful for whom her spreading funds were fill'd, Her fleets were freighted, and her fields were till'd. No longer now shall France and Spain combin'd, Strong in their golden Indies, awe mankind. Brave Catalans, who for your freedom strive, And in your shatter'd bulwarks yet survive, For you alone, worthy a better fate, O, may this happy change not come too late! Great in your sufferings!âBut, my muse, forbear; Nor damp the publick gladness with a Tear: The Hero has receiv'd their just complaint, Grac'd with the name of our fam'd patron-saint: Like him, with pleasure he foregoes his rest, And longs, like him, to succour the distress'd. Firm to his friends, tenacious of his word, As justice calls, he draws or sheaths the sword: Matur'd by thought his councils shall prevail; Nor shall his promise to his people fail. He comes, desire of Nations! England's boast! Already has he reach'd the Belgian coast. Our great deliverer comes! and with him brings A progeny of late-succeeding Kings, Fated to triumph o'er Britannia's foes In distant years, and fix the world's repose. The floating squadrons now approach the shore; Lost in the sailors shouts, the canons roar: And now, behold, the sovereign of the main, High on the deck, amidst his shining train, Surveys the subject flood. An eastern gale Plays through the shrouds, and swells in every sail: Th'obsequious waves his new dominion own, And gently waft their monarch to his throne. Now the glad Britons hail their king to land, Hang on the Rocks, and blacken all the strand: But who the silent extasy can show, The Passions which in nobler bosoms glow? Who can describe the godlike patriot's zeal? Or who, my lord, your generous Joys reveal? Ordain'd, once more, our treasure to advance, Retrieve our Trade, and sink the pride of France, Once more the long-neglected arts to raise, And form each rising genius for the bays. Accept the present of a grateful song; This prelude may provoke the learned throng: To Cam and Isis shall the joyful news, By me convey'd, awaken every muse. Even now the vocal tribe in verse conspires; And I already hear their sounding lyres: To them the mighty labour I resign, Give up the Theme, and quit the tuneful Nine. So when the spring first smiles among the trees, And blossoms open to the vernal breez, The watchful nightingale, with early strains, Summons the warblers of the woods and plains, But drops her musick, when the choir appear, And listens to the concert of the year. To the Honourable JAMES CRAGGS, Esq; Secretary at WAR. Though Britain's hardy Troops demand your Care, And cheerful Friends your Hours of Leisure share; O Craggs, for Candour known! indulge awhile My fond Desire, and on my Labour smile: Nor count it always an Abuse of Time To read a Long Epistle, though in Rhyme. To you I send my Thoughts, too long confin'd, And ease the Burden of a Loyal Mind; To you my secret Transports I disclose, That rise above the languid Powers of Prose. But, while these artless Numbers You peruse, Think 'tis my Heart that dictates, not the Muse; My Heart which at the name of Brunswick fires, And no Assistance from the Muse requires. Believe me, Sir, your Breast, that glows with Zeal For George's Glory and the publick Weal, Your Breast alone feels more pathetick Heats; Your Heart alone with stronger Raptures beats. When I review the Great Examples past, And to the Former Ages join the Last; Still, as the Godlike Heroes to me rise, In Arms triumphant, and in Councils wise, The King is ever present to my Mind; His Greatness traced in every Page I find: The Greek and Roman Pens his Virtues tell, And under Shining Names on Brunswick dwell. At Hampton while He breathes untainted Air, And seems to Vulgar Eyes devoid of Care; The British Muses to the Grove will press, Tune their melodious Harps, and claim Access: But let Them not too rashly touch the Strings; For Fate allows no Solitude to kings. Hail to the Shades, where William, Great in Arms, Retir'd from Conquest to Maria's Charms! Where George serene in Majesty appears, And plans the Wonders of succeeding Years! There, as he walks, his comprehensive Mind Surveys the Globe, and takes in all Mankind: While, Britain, for thy Sake he wears the Crown; To spread thy Power as wide as his Renown: To make Thee Umpire of contending States, And poise the Ballance in the Worlds Debates. From the smooth Terrass as He casts his Eye, And sees the Current Sea-ward rolling by; What schemes of Commerce rise in his Designs. Pledges of Wealth! and unexhausted Mines! Through Winds and Waves, beneath inclement Skies, Where Stars, distinguish'd by no Name, arise, Our Fleets shall undiscover'd Lands explore, And a New People hear our Cannons roar. The Rivers long in ancient Story fam'd Shall flow obscure, nor with the Thames be nam'd: Nor shall our Poets copy from their Praise, And Nymphs and Syrens to thy Honour raise; Nor make thy Banks with Tritons Shells resound, Nor bind thy Brows with humble Sedges round: But paint Thee as thou art; a Peopled Stream! The Boast of Merchants, and the Sailor's Theme! Whose spreading Flood unnumber'd Ships sustain, And pour whole Towns afloat into the Main; While the redundant Seas waft up fresh Stores, The daily tribute of far-distant Shores. Back to thy Source I trace thy silver Train, That gently winds through many a fertile Plain; Where Flocks and lowing Herds in Plenty feed; And Shepherds tune at ease the vocal Reed: Ere yet thy Waters meet the briny Tide, And freighted Vessels down thy Channel ride; Ere yet thy Billows leave their Banks behind, Swell into State, and foam before the Wind: Thy Sovereign's Emblem! In thy Course compleat! When I behold Him in his lov'd Retreat, When Rural Scenes their pleasing Views disclose, A Silvan Deity the Monarch shows; As if He only knew the Woods to grace, To rouze the Stag, and animate the Chace: While every Hour, from Thence, his high Commands, By speedy Winds convey'd to various Lands, Controul Affairs; give weighty Councils Birth; And sway the mighty Rulers of the Earth. Were He, our Island's Glory and Defence, To reign unactive, at the World's Expence; Say, generous Craggs, who then should quell the Rage Of lawless Faction, and reform the Age? Who should our dear-bought Liberties maintain? Who fix our Leagues with France, and treat with Spain? Who check the headstrong Swede; asswage the Czar; Secure our Peace, and quench the Northern War? The Turk, though He the Christian Name defies, And curses Eugene, yet from Eugene flies, His Cause to Brunswick's Equity dare trust; He knows him Valiant, and concludes him Just: He knows his Fame in early Youth acquir'd, When Turban'd Hoasts before his Sword retir'd. Thus while his Influence to the Poles extends, Or where the Day begins, or where it ends, Far from our Coasts he drives off all Alarms; And those his Power protects, his Goodness charms. Great in Himself, and undebas'd with Pride, The Sovereign lays his Regal State aside, Pleas'd to appear without the bright Disguise Of Pomp; and on his inborn Worth relies. His Subjects are his Guests; and daily boast The Condescension of their Royal Host: While Crowds succeeding Crowds on either Hand, A ravish'd Multitude, admiring stand. His manly Wit and Sense with Candour join'd, His Speech with every Elegance refin'd, His winning Aspect, his becoming Ease, Peculiar Graces all, conspire to please, And render him to every Heart approv'd; The King respected, and the Man belov'd. Nor is his Force of Genius less admir'd, When most from Crowds or publick Cares retir'd. The Learned Arts by turns Admittance find; At once unbend and exercise his Mind. The secret Springs of Nature, long conceal'd, And to the Wise by slow Degrees reveal'd, (Delightful Search!) his piercing Thought descries. Oft through the Concave Azure of the Skies. His Soul delights to range, a boundless Space, Which Myriads of Celestial Glories grace; Worlds behind Worlds, that deep in Aether lye, And Suns, that twinkle to the distant Eye; Or call them Stars, on which our Fates depend, And every ruling Star is Brunswick's Friend. Soon as the rising Sun shoots o'er the Stream, And gilds the Palace with a ruddy Beam, You to the healthful Chace attend the King, And hear the Forrest with the Huntsmen ring: While in the dusty Town We rule the State, And from Gazettes determine England's Fate. Our groundless Hopes and groundless Fears prevail, As artful Brokers comment on the Mail Deafned with News, with Politicks opprest, I wish the Wind ne'er vary'd from the West. Secure, on GEORGE'S Councils I rely, Give up my Cares, and Britain's Foes defy. What though Cabals are form'd, and impious Leagues. Though Rome fills Europe with her dark Intrigues? His Vigilance, on every State intent, Defeats their Plots, and over-rules th'Event. But whither do my vain Endeavours tend? Or how shall I my rash Attempt defend? Divided in my Choice, from Praise to Praise I rove, bewilder'd in the pleasing Maze. One Virtue mark'd, another I pursue, While yet another rises to my View. Unequal to the Task, too late I find The growing Theme unfinish'd left behind. Thus the deluded Bee, in hopes to drain At once the Thymy Treasure of the Plain, Wide ranging on her little Pinions toils, And skims o'er hundred Flowers for one she spoils: When soon o'erburden'd with the fragrant Weight, Homeward she flies, and flags beneath her Freight. TO LORD CARTERET, departing from Dublin. 1726. Behold, Britannia waves her flag on high, And calls forth breezes from the western sky, And beckons to her son, and smooths the tide, That does Hibernia from her clifts divide. Go, Carteret, go; and, with thee, go along The nation's blessing, and the poet's song, Loud acclamations, with melodious lays, The kindest wishes, and sincerest praise. Go, Carteret, go; and bear my joys away! So speaks the muse, that fain would bid thee stay: So spoke the virgin to the youth unkind, Who gave his vows, and canvass, to the wind, And promis'd to return; but never more Did he return to the ThreÃ¯cian shore. Go, Carteret, go: alas, a tedious while Hast thou been absent from thy mother-isle; A slow-pac'd train of months to thee and thine, A flight of moments to a heart like mine, That feels perfections, and resigns with pain Enjoyments I may never know again. O, while mine eye pursues the fading sails, Smooth roll ye waves, and steddy breathe ye gales, And urge with gentle speed to Albion's strand A houshold fair amidst the fairest land, In every decency of Life polite, A freight of virtues, wafting from my sight: And now farewel, O early in renown, Illustrious, young, in labours for the crown, Just, and benign, and vigilant, in power, And elegant to grace the vacant hour, Relaxing sweet! Nor are we born to wear The brow still bent, and give up life to care: And thou, mild glory beaming round his fame, Francisca, thou, his first, his latest, flame, Parent of bloom! In pleasing arts refin'd! Farewel thy hand, and voice, in musick join'd, Thy courtesy, as soothing as thy song, And smiles soft-gleaming on the courtly throng: And thou, Charissa, hastening to thy prime, And Carolina, chiding tardy time, Who every tender wish of mine divide, For whom I strung the lyre, once lay'd aside, Receive, and bear in mind, my fond farewell, Thrive on in life! and, thriving on, excell! Accept this token, Carteret, of good will, The voice of nature, undebas'd by skill, These parting numbers cadenced by my grief, For thy lov'd sake and for my own relief, If aught, alas, thy absence may relieve, Now I am left, perhaps, through life to grieve: Yet would I hope, yet hope, I know not why, (But hopes and wishes in one balance ly) Thou may'st revisit, with thy wonted smiles, IÃ«rna, island set around with isles: May the same heart, that bids thee now adieu, Salute thy sails, and hail thee into view. ODES. ETC. A BACCHANALIAN SONG. 1 Come, fill me a Glass, fill it high, A Bumper, a Bumper I'll have: He's a Fool that will flinch, I'll not bate an Inch, Tho' I drink my self into the Grave. 2 Here's a Health to all those jolly Souls, Who like me will never give o'er, Whom no Danger controuls, but will take off their Bowls, And merrily stickle for more. 3 Drown Reason and all such weak Foes, I scorn to obey her Command; Cou'd she ever suppose I'd be led by the Nose, And let my Glass idly stand? 4 Reputation's a Bugbear to Fools, A Foe to the Joys of dear drinking, Made use of by Tools, who'd set us new Rules, And bring us to politick thinking. 5 Fill 'em all, I'll have six in a Hand, For I've trifl'd an Age away; 'Tis in vain to command the fleeting Sand Rowls on, and cannot stay. 6 Come my Lads, move the Glass, drink about, We'll drink the Universe dry; We'll set Foot to Foot, and drink it all out, If once we grow sober we die. SONG. [From White's and Will's] I From White's and Will's To purling rills The love-sick Strephon flies; There, full of woe, His numbers flow, And all in rhyme he dies. II The fair coquett, With feign'd regret, Invites him back to town; But, when in tears The youth appears, She meets him with a frown. III Full oft' the maid This prank had play'd, 'Till angry Strephon swore, And, what is strange, Tho' loth to change, Would never see her more. SONG. [Why we love, and why we hate] I Why we love, and why we hate, Is not granted us to know; Random chance, or wilful fate, Guides the shaft from Cupid's bow. II If on me Zelinda frown, Madness 'tis in me to grieve: Since her will is not her own, Why should I uneasy live? III If I for Zelinda dy, Deaf to poor Mizella's cries, Ask not me the reason why: Seek the riddle in the skies. TO SIGNORA CUZZONI. May 25, 1724. Little Siren of the stage, Charmer of an idle age, Empty warbler, breathing lyre, Wanton gale of fond desire, Bane of every manly art, Sweet enfeebler of the heart, O, too pleasing in thy strain, Hence, to southern climes again; Tuneful mischief, vocal spell, To this island bid farewel; Leave us as we ought to be, Leave the Britons rough and free. To MIRANDA. If e'er I quit the Single Life, Be This the Model of my Wife. O Beauty, without Art, compleat; Who, from her Toilet simply neat, The golden Tissue can despise, And wears no Brilliants, but her Eyes. Soft-blended in her Eyes should meet, Desiring Love, and sparkling Wit; And in her dimpled Smiles be seen A modest with a cheerful Mien. As Pauses find in Musick Place, Her Speech let proper Silence grace. Her Conversation ever free From Censure, as from Levity: And Undissembled Innocence, Not apt to give, or take Offence. Nor fond of Compliments, nor Rude; Not a Coquette, nor yet a Prude. Averse to wanton Serenades, Nor pleas'd with Midnight Masquerades. The Vertues, that her Sex adorn, By Honour guarded, not by Scorn. Not Superstitious, nor Profane, But in Religion Greatly Plain. To such a Virgin, such a Wife, I give my Love; I give my Life. To the Memory of the late EARL of HALIFAX. June 30, 1718. Weeping o'er thy sacred urn, Ever shall the muses mourn; Sadly shall their numbers flow, Ever elegant in woe. Thousands, nobly born, shall dy, Thousands in oblivion ly, Names, which leave no trace behind, Like the clouds before the wind, When the dusky shadows pass, Lightly fleeting o'er the grass. But, O Halifax, thy name Shall through ages rise in fame: Sweet remembrance shalt thou find, Sweet in every noble mind. To the Honourable MISS CARTERET. Bloom of beauty, early flow'r Of the blissful bridal bow'r, Thou, thy parents pride and care, Fairest offspring of the fair, Lovely pledge of mutual love, Angel seeming from above, Was it not thou day by day Dost thy very sex betray, Female more and more appear, Female, more than angel dear, How to speak thy face and mien, (Soon too dangerous to be seen) How shall I, or shall the muse, Language of resemblance chuse? Language like thy mien and face, Full of sweetness, full of grace! By the next-returning spring, When again the linnets sing, When again the lambkins play, Pretty sportlings full of May, When the meadows next are seen, Sweet enamel! white and green, And the year, in fresh attire, Welcomes every gay desire, Blooming on shalt thou appear More inviting than the year, Fairer sight than orchard shows, Which beside a river blows: Yet, another spring I see, And a brighter bloom in thee: And another round of time, Circling, still improves thy prime: And, beneath the vernal skies, Yet a verdure more shall rise, 'E're thy beauties, kindling slow, In each finish'd feature glow, 'E're, in smiles and in disdain, Thou exert thy maiden reign, Absolute to save, or kill, Fond beholders, at thy will. Then the taper-moulded waste With a span of ribbon braced, And the swell of either breast, And the wide high-vaulted chest, And the neck so white and round, Little neck with brilliants bound, And the store of charms which shine Above, in lineaments divine, Crowded in a narrow space To compleat the desp'rate face, These alluring powers, and more, Shall enamour'd youths adore; These, and more, in courtly lays, Many an aking heart shall praise. Happy thrice, and thrice agen, Happyest he of happy men, Who, in courtship greatly sped, Wins the damsel to his bed, Bears the virgin-prize away, Counting life one nuptial day! For the dark-brown dusk of hair, Shadowing thick thy forehead fair, Down the veiny temples growing, O'er the sloping shoulders flowing, And the smoothly-pencil'd brow, Mild to him in every vow, And the fringed lid below, Thin as thinnest blossoms blow, And the hazely-lucid eye, Whence heart-winning glances fly, And that cheek of health, o'erspred With soft-blended white and red, And the witching smiles which break Round those lips, which sweetly speak, And thy gentleness of mind, Gentle from a gentle kind, These endowments, heav'nly dow'r! Brought him in the promis'd hour, Shall for ever bind him to thee, Shall renew him still to woo thee. On the Death of the Right Honourable. William Earl Cowper. 1723. STROPHE I. Wake the British harp again, To a sad melodious strain; Wake the harp, whose every string, When Halifax resign'd his breath, Accus'd inexorable death; For I, once more, must in affliction sing, One song of sorrow more bestow, The burden of a heart o'ercharg'd with woe: Yet, O my soul, if aught may bring relief, Full many, grieving, shall applaud thy grief, The pious verse, that Cowper does deplore, Whom all the boasted powers of verse cannot restore, ANTISTROPHE I. Not to her, his fondest care, Not to his lov'd offspring fair, Nor his country ever dear, From her, from them, from Britain torn: With her, with them, does Britain mourn: His name, from every eye, calls forth a tear; And, intermingling sighs with praise, All good men wish the number of his days Had been to him twice told, and twice again, In that seal'd book, where all things which pertain To mortal man, whatever things befall, Are from eternity confirm'd, beyond recall: EPODE I. Where every loss, and every gain, Where every grief, and every joy, Every pleasure, every pain, Each bitter and each sweet alloy, To us uncertain though they flow, Are pre-ordain'd, and fix'd, above. Too wretched state! did man foreknow Those ills, which man cannot remove, Vain is wisdom for preventing What the wisest live lamenting. STROPHE II. Hither sent, who knows the day When he shall be call'd away? Various is the term assign'd: An hour, a day, some months, or years, The breathing soul on earth appears: But, through the swift succession of mankind, Swarm after swarm! a busy race, The strength of cities, or of courts the grace, Or who in camps delight, or who abide Diffus'd o'er lands, or float on oceans wide, Of them, though many here long-lingring dwell, And see their children's children, yet, how few excell! ANTISTROPHE II. Here we come, and hence we go, Shadows passing to and fro, Seen a-while, forgotten soon: But thou, to fair distinction born, Thou Cowper, beamy in the morn Of life, still brightening to the pitch of noon, Scarce verging to the steep decline, Hence summon'd while thy virtues radiant shine, Thou singled out the fosterling of fame, Secure of praise, nor less secur'd from blame, Shalt be remember'd with a fond applause, So long as Britons own the same indulgent laws. EPODE II. United in one publick weal, Rejoicing in one freedom, all, Cowper's hand apply'd the Seal, And level'd the partition-wall. The chosen seeds of great events Are thinly sown, and slowly rise: And Time the harvest-scythe presents, In season, to the good and wise: Hymning to the harp my story, Fain would I record his glory. STROPHE III. Pouring forth, with heavy heart, Truth unleaven'd, pure of art, Like the hallow'd Bard of yore, Who chaunted in authentick rhymes The worthies of the good old times, 'E're living vice in verse was varnish'd o'er, And vertue dyed without a song. Support of friendless right, to powerful wrong A check, behold him in the judgement-seat! Twice, there, approv'd, in righteousness compleat: In just awards, how gracious! tempering law With mercy, and reproving with a winning awe. ANTISTROPHE III. Hear him speaking, and you hear Reason tuneful to the ear! Lips with thymy Language sweet, Distilling on the hearer's mind The balm of wisdom, speech refin'd, Celestial gifts!âOh, when the nobles meet, When next, thou sea-surrounded land, Thy nobles meet at Brunswick's high command, In vain they shall the charmer's voice desire! In vain those lips of eloquence require! That mild conviction, which the soul assails By soft alarms, and with a gentle force prevails! EPODE III. To such persuasion, willing, yields The liberal Mind, in freedom train'd, Freedom, which, in crimson'd fields, By hardy toil our fathers gain'd, Inheritance of long descent! The sacred pledge, so dearly priz'd By that bless'd spirit we lament: Grief-easing lays, by grief devis'd, Plaintive Numbers, gently flowing, Sooth the sorrows to him owing! STROPHE IV. Early on his growing heir, Stamp what time may not impair, As he grows, that coming Years, Or youthful Pleasures, or the vain Gigantic phanton of the brain Ambition, breeding monstrous hopes and fears, Or worthier cares, to youth unknown, Ennobling manhood, flower of life fullblown, May never wear the bosom-image faint: O, let him prove what words but weakly paint, The living lovely semblance of his sire, A model to his son! that ages may admire! ANTISTROPHE IV. Every virtue, every grace, Still renewing in the race, Once thy father's pleasing hope, Thy widow'd mother's comfort now, No fuller bliss does heaven allow, While we behold yon wide-spread azure cope With burning stars thick-lustred o'er, Than to enjoy, and to deserve, a store Of treasur'd fame by blameless deeds acquir'd, By all unenvied, and by all desir'd, Free-gift of men, the tribute of good-will! Rich in this patrimony fair, increase it still. EPODE IV. The fulness of content remains Above the yet unfathom'd skies, Where, triumphant, gladness reigns, Where wishes cease, and pleasures rise Beyond all wish; where bitter tears For dying friends are never shed; Where, sighing, none desire pass'd years Recall'd, or wish the future fled. Mournful measures, O, relieve me! Sweet remembrance! cease to grieve me. STROPHE V. He the robe of justice wore Sully'd not, as heretofore, When the magistrate was sought With yearly gifts. Of what avail Are guilty hoards? for life is frail; And we are judg'd where favour is not bought. By him forewarn'd, thou frantick isle, How did the thirst of gold thy sons beguile! Beneath the specious ruin thousands groan'd, By him, alas, forewarn'd, by him bemoan'd. Where shall his like, on earth, be found? oh, when Shall I, once more, behold the most belov'd of men! ANTISTROPHE V. Winning aspect! winning mind! Soul and body aptly join'd! Searching thought, engaging wit, Enabled to instruct, or please, Uniting dignity with ease, By nature form'd for every purpose fit, Endearing excellence!âO, why Is such perfection born, and born to dy? Or do such rare endowments still survive, As plants remov'd to milder regions thrive, In one eternal spring? and we bewail The parting soul, new-born to life that cannot fail, EPODE V. Where sacred friendship, plighted love, Parental joys, unmix'd with care, Through perpetual time improve? Or do the deathless blessed share Sublimer raptures, unreveal'd, Beyond our weak conception pure? But, while those glories ly conceal'd, The righteous count the promise sure, Trials to the last enduring, To the last their hope securing. To the Right Honourable William Pulteney, Esq May 1, 1723. I Who, much distinguish'd, yet is bless'd? Who, dignified above the rest, Does, still, unenvied live? Not to the Man whose wealth abounds, Nor to the man whose fame resounds, Does heaven such favour give, Nor to the noble-born, nor to the strong, Nor to the gay, the beautiful, or young. II Whom then, secure of happiness, Does every eye beholding bless, And every tongue commend? Him, Pulteney, who possessing store Is not solicitous of more, Who, to mankind a friend, Nor envies, nor is envied by, the great, Polite in courts, polite in his retreat: III Whose unambitious, active, soul Attends the welfare of the whole, When publick storms arise, And, in the calm, a thousand ways Diversifies his nights and days, Still elegantly wise; While books, each morn, the lightsom soul invite, And friends with season'd mirth improve the night. IV In him do men no blemish see; And factions in his praise agree, When most they vex the state: Distinguish'd favorite of the skies, Belov'd he lives, lamented dies: Yet, shall he not to fate Submit entire; the rescuing muse shall save His precious name, and win him from the grave. V Too frail is brass and polish'd stone; Perpetual fame the muse alone On merit can bestow: Yet, must the time-enduring song, The verse unrival'd by the throng, From nature's bounty flow: The ungifted tribe in meter pass away, Oblivion's sport, the poets of a day. VI What laws shall o'er the Ode preside? In vain would art presume to guide The chariot-wheels of praise, When fancy, driving, ranges free, Fresh flowers selecting like the bee, And regularly strays, While nature does, disdaining aids of skill, The mind with thought, the ears with numbers, fill. VII As when the Theban hymns divine Make proud Olympian victors shine In an eternal blaze, The varying measures, ever new, Unbeaten tracks of fame pursue, While through the glorious maze The poet leads his heroes to renown, And weaves in verse a never-fading crown. To Miss Margaret Pulteney, daughter of Daniel Pulteney Esq; in the Nursery. April 27, 1727. Dimply damsel, sweetly smiling, All caressing, none beguiling, Bud of beauty, fairly blowing, Every charm to nature owing, This and that new thing admiring, Much of this and that enquiring, Knowledge by degrees attaining, Day by day some vertue gaining, Ten years hence, when I leave chiming, Beardless poets, fondly rhyming, (Fescu'd now, perhaps, in spelling,) On thy riper beauties dwelling, Shall accuse each killing feature Of the cruel, charming, creature, Whom I knew complying, willing, Tender, and averse to killing. To Miss Charlotte Pulteney, in her Mother's Arms. May 1, 1724. Timely blossom, infant fair, Fondling of a happy pair, Every morn, and every night, Their solicitous delight, Sleeping, waking, still at ease, Pleasing, without skill to please, Little gossip, blithe and hale, Tatling many a broken tale, Singing many a tuneless song, Lavish of a heedless tongue, Simple maiden, void of art, Babbling out the very heart, Yet abandon'd to thy will, Yet imagining no ill, Yet too innocent to blush, Like the linlet in the bush. To the Mother-linnet's note Moduling her slender throat, Chirping forth thy petty joys, Wanton in the change of toys, Like the linnet green, in May, Flitting to each bloomy spray, Wearied then, and glad of rest, Like the linlet in the nest. This thy present happy lot, This, in time, will be forgot: Other pleasures, other cares, Ever-busy time prepares; And thou shalt in thy daughter see, This picture, once, resembled thee. To the Right Honourable ROBERT WALPOLE Esq June 15, 1724. Votary to publick zeal, Minister of England's weal, Have you leisure for a song, Tripping lightly o'er the tongue, Swift and sweet in every measure, Tell me, Walpole, have you leisure? Nothing lofty will I sing, Nothing of the favourite king, Something, rather, sung with ease, Simply elegant to please. Fairy virgin, British muse, Some unhear'd of story chuse: Chuse the Glory of the swain, Gifted with a magick strain, Swaging grief of every kind, Healing, with a verse, the mind: To him came a man of power, To him, in a cheerless hour; When the swain, by Druids taught, Soon divin'd his irksom thought, Soon the maple harp he strung, Soon, with silver accent, sung. âSteerer of a mighty realm, âPilot, waking o'er the helm, âBlessing of thy native soil, âWeary of a thankless toil, âCast repining thought behind, âGive thy trouble to the wind. âMortal, destin'd to excell, âBear the blame of doing well, âLike the Worthies great of old, âIn the list of Fame enroll'd. âWhat, though titles thou decline? âStill the more thy virtues shine. âEnvy, with her serpent eye, âMarks each praise that soars on high. âTo thy lot resign thy will: âEvery good is mix'd with ill. âSee, the white unblemish'd rose âOn a thorny bramble blows: âSee, the torrent pouring rain âDoes the limpid fountain stain: âSee, the giver of the day âUrgeth on, through clouds, his way: âNothing is, entirely, bless'd; âEnvy does thy worth attest. âPleasing visions, at command, âAnswer to my voice and hand; âQuick, the blissful scene prepare, âSooth the patriot's heavy care: âVisions, cheering to the fight, âGive him earnest of delight. âWise disposer of affairs, âView the end of all thy cares! âForward cast thy ravish'd eyes, âSee the glad'ning harvest rise: âLo, the people reap thy pain! âThine the labour, their the gain. âYonder turn, a-while, thy view, âTurn thee to yon spreading yew, âOnce the gloomy tree of fate, âOnce the plighted virgin's hate: âNow, no longer, does it grow âParent of the warring bow: âSee, beneath the guiltless shade, âPeasants shape the plow and spade, âRescued, ever, from the fear âOf the whistling shaft and spear. âLo, where Plenty comes, with Peace! âHear the breath of murmur cease: âSee, at last, unclouded days; âHear, at last, unenvied praise. âNothing shall thy soul molest; âLabour is the price of rest. âMortal, destin'd to excell, âBless the toil of doing well! Supplication for Miss Carteret in the Small-Pox. Dublin, July 31, 1725. Pow'r o'er ev'ry pow'r supreme, Thou the poet's hallow'd theme, From thy mercy-seat on high, Hear my numbers, hear my cry. Breather of all vital breath, Arbiter of life and death, Oh, preserve this innocence, Yet unconscious of offence, Yet in life and virtue growing, Yet no debt to nature owing. Thou, who giv'st angelick grace To the blooming virgin face, Let the fell disease not blight What thou mad'st for man's delight: O'er her features let it pass Like the breeze o'er springing grass, Gentle as refreshing showers Sprinkled over opening flowers. O, let years alone diminish Beauties thou wast pleas'd to finish. To the pious parents give That the darling fair may live: Turn to blessings all their care, Save their fondness from despair. Mitigate the lurking pains Lodg'd within her tender veins; Soften every throb of anguish, Suffer not her strength to languish; Take her to thy careful keeping, And prevent the mother's weeping. TO Miss Georgiana Youngest Daughter to Lord Carteret. August 10, 1725. Little charm of placid mien, Miniature of beauty's queen, Numbering years, a scanty nine, Stealing hearts without design, Young inveigler, fond in wiles, Prone to mirth, profuse in smiles, Yet a novice in disdain, Pleasure giving without pain, Still caressing, still caress'd, Thou, and all thy lovers bless'd, Never teiz'd, and never teizing, O for ever pleas'd and pleasing! Hither, British muse of mine, Hither all the Grecian nine, With the lovely graces three, And your promis'd nurseling see: Figure on her waxen mind Images of life refin'd; Make it, as a garden gay, Every bud of thought display, Till, improving year by year, The whole culture shall appear, Voice, and speech, and action, rising, All to human sense surprising. Is the silken web so thin As the texture of her skin? Can the lilly and the rose Such unsully'd hue disclose? Are the violets so blue As her veins expos'd to view? Do the stars, in wintry sky, Twinkle brighter than her eye? Has the morning lark a throat Sounding sweeter than her note? Whoe'er knew the like before thee? They who knew the nymph that bore thee. From thy pastime and thy toys, From thy harmless cares and joys, Give me now a moment's time: When thou shalt attain thy prime, And thy bosom feel desire, Love the likeness of thy sire, One ordain'd, thro' life, to prove Still thy glory, still thy love. Like thy sister, and like thee, Let thy nurtur'd daughters be: Semblance of the fair who bore thee, Trace the pattern set before thee. Where the Liffy meets the main, Has thy sister hear'd my strain: From the Liffy to the Thames, Minstrel echoes sing their names, Wafting to the willing ear Many a cadence sweet to hear, Smooth as gently breathing gales O'er the ocean and the vales, While the vessel calmly glides O'er the level glassy tides, While the summer flowers are springing, And the new fledg'd birds are singing. Occasion'd by the early SINGING of a LARK. Attend, my Soul! The early Birds inspire My groveling Thoughts with pure, celestial Fire. They from their temp'rate Sleep awake, and pay Their thankful Anthems for the New-born Day. See, how the tuneful Lark is mounted high! And, Poet-like, salutes the Eastern Sky. He warbles thro' the fragrant Air his Layes, And seems the Beauties of the Morn to praise. But Man, more void of Gratitude, awakes, And gives no Thanks for that sweet Rest he takes: Looks on the glorious Sun's new-kindled Flame, Without one Thought of Him, from whom it came. The Wretch, unhallow'd, does the Day begin; Shakes off his Sleep, but shakes not off his Sin. A MIDNIGHT THOUGHT. When Gamesome Youth, and Love's unruly Fire, Are quell'd by Age, that deadens all Desire; When Chearful Days and Jovial Nights are fled, And drooping Health inclines her sickly Head; When downy Sleep, tho' courted long, denies To bless my Bed, and close my weary Eyes; When Nature sickens, and with fainting Breath, Struggles beneath the bitter pangs of Death; When helpless Art no hopes of Life can give, Nor Pray'r, nor Tears, the sentenc'd Wretch reprieve; When all our Friends, then few, make heavy Moan; And heighten all our Sorrows by their own: Amid the Terrors of this solemn Woe, The fleeting Soul begins her self to know; Turns o'er the Register of Life in Haste, Weighs all her Thoughts, her Words and Actions past. Then, if no frightful Images appear, No ghastly Ills awake her conscious Fear; Gently she lays her down in Peace to rest, As Infants sleep upon their Mother's Breast. SONG. [Then never let me see her more!] Then never let me see her more! In vain I sigh, in vain adore. In some lonely Desart Place, Far from Sight of Human Race; In some unfrequented Cell, Where neither Joy nor Sorrow dwell, Oh! let me' endeavour to forget At once my self, and Amoret. Reading Mr. WALLER. Inhuman Saccharissa! not to love The Man, whose Verse might Rocks to Pity move. Yet, since Amphion sung, they Sense retain; And Verse may soften all Things, but Disdain. As he the fatal Glories of your Eyes, His easie Wit, and courtly Pen, I prize. In vain, like him, I sigh, in vain I mourn; For, Waller's Muse has Saccharissa's Scorn. LYING at her FEET. This Posture, and these Tears, that Heav'n might move, In vain I use in Favour of my Love: And while thus prostrate at her Feet I lye, Like some fair Rock she stands, that tow'ring high, Seems deaf to those sad Murmurs, which below The plaintive Waters utter, as they flow. [Promis'd Blessing of the Year] Promis'd Blessing of the Year; Fairest Blossom of the Spring; Thy Fond Mother's Wish; appear! Haste, to hear the Linnets sing. Haste to breathe the vernal Air: Come, and see the Primrose blow. Nature does her Lap prepare: Nature thinks thy Coming slow. Glad the People; quickly Smile; Darling Native of the Isle! EPIGRAMS AND SHORT POEMS On a Company of bad Dancers to good Musick. How ill the motion with the musick suits! So Orpheus fidled, and so danc'd the brutes. EPIGRAM. [George came to the crown without striking a blow] George came to the crown without striking a blow: Ah, quoth the Pretender, would I could do so! In Answer to the Question, What is Thought? The hermit's solace in his cell, The fire that warms the poet's brain, The lover's heaven, or his hell, The madman's sport, the wise man's pain. Half Masking her Self when she Smil'd. So, when the Sun, with his Meridian Light, Too fiercely darts upon our feeble Sight; We thank th'officious Cloud, by whose kind Aid We view his Glory, lessen'd in a Shade. In the YEAR 1714. In this bright List may generous Passions reign; And every British Fair a slave disdain! While, stung with Envy, servile Nations see Our Nymphs so Beautiful; our Men so Free! In vain the mock Saint-George would give Alarms To English Valour, rais'd by English Charms. How glorious is the Heat, how strong the Fire, When Liberty and Love, at once, inspire! To Mr. Addison on Cato. The mind to virtue is by verse subdu'd, And the true poet is a publick good: This Britain feels, while, by your lines inspir'd, Her free-born sons to glorious thoughts are fir'd. In Rome had you espous'd the vanquish'd cause, Inflam'd her senate and upheld her laws, Your manly scenes had liberty restor'd, And giv'n the just success to Cato's sword, O'er CÃ¦sar's arms your genius had prevail'd, And the muse triumph'd where the patriot fail'd. On Wit and Wisdom. A FRAGMENT. In search of wisdom far from wit I fly: Wit is a harlot, beauteous to the eye, In whose bewitching arms our early time We waste, and vigour of our youthful prime: But when reflexion comes with riper years, And manhood with a thoughtful brow appears, We cast the mistress off to take a wife, And, wed to wisdom, lead a happy life. The following Epitaph on the Monument of my Kinswoman was written at the Request of her Husband. WITHIN the Burial-Vault near this Marble, lieth the Body of PENELOPE, youngest Daughter (and Coheir with her Sister ELIZABETH) to ROBERT PHILIPS of Newton-Regis, in the County of Warwick, Esquire. She died in her Six and Thirtieth Year, on the 25th Day of January, MDCCXXVI. Let this Inscription (Appealing yet to testimonies manifold) Recall to every surviving witness, And, for ensample, record to posterity, Her endowments, Whether owing to the indulgency of nature, Or to the assiduous lessons of education, Or to the silent admonitions of reflection. To her parents, husband, children, In no care, no duty, no affection, Was she wanting, Receiving, deserving, winning, From them respectively, Equal endearments. Of countenance and of disposition, Open, chearful, modest; Of behaviour, humble, courteous, easy; Of speech, affable, free, discreet; In civilities, punctual, sincere, and elegant; Prone to offices of kindness and good will; To enmity a stranger; Forward, earnest, impatient, To succour the distress'd, To comfort the afflicted; Solicitous for the poor, And rich in store of alms: Whereby she became The delight, the love, the blessing, of all. In her houshold flourished Chearfulness, due order, thrift, and plenty. In the closet retired, In the temple publick, Morning and evening did she worship; By instruction, by example, Sedulous to nurture her children in godliness: So prevalent her love to them Visited with that sore disease, Which too often kills or blites The mother's fondest hopes, That (regardless of self-preservation) In piously watching over their lives She, catching the infection, lost her own, Triumphing, through resignation, Over sickness, pain, anguish, agony, And (encompassed with tears and lamentations) Expiring in the fervour of prayer. TO the Memory, ever dear and precious, of his most affectionate, most beloved, and most deserving, Wife, is this Monument raised by HENRY VERNON of Hilton, in the County of Stafford, Esquire: to him she bore five Sons and two daughters, all surviving, save Elizabeth; who dying, in her second Year, of the Small Pox, some few Days before, resteth by her Mother. THE FABLE of THULE, UNFINISHED. Far northward as the Dane extends his sway, Where the sun glances but a sloping ray, Beneath the sharpest rigour of the skies, Disdainful Thule's wintry island lies. Unhappy maid! thy tale, forgotten long, Shall virgins learn from my instructive song, And every youth, who lingers in despair, By thy example warn the cruel fair. In Cyprus, sacred to the queen of love, (Where stands her temple, and her myrtle grove,) Was Thule born, uncertain how: 'tis said Once Venus won Adonis to her bed, And pregnant grew, the birth to chance assign'd In woods, and foster'd by the feather'd kind. With flowers some strew the helpless orphan round, With downy moss some spread the carpet ground, Some ripened fruits, some fragrant honey, bring; And some fetch water from the running spring; While others warble from the boughs, to cheer Their infant charge, and tune her tender ear. Soon as the sun forsakes the evening skies, And hid in shades the gloomy forest lies, The nightingales their tuneful vigils keep, And lull her, with their gentler strains, to sleep. This the prevailing rumour: as she grew, No dubious tokens spoke the rumour true. In every forming feature might be seen Some bright resemblance of the Cyprian queen: Nor was it hard the hunter youth to trace, In all her early passion for the chace: And when, on springing flowers reclin'd, she sung, The birds upon the bending branches hung, While, warbling, she express'd their various strains, And, at a distance, charm'd the listening swains: So sweet her voice resounded through the wood, They thought the nymph some Siren from the flood. Half human thus by lineage, half divine, In forests did the lonely beauty shine, Like wood-land flowers, which paint the desert glades, And waste their sweets in unfrequented shades. No human face she saw, and rarely seen By human face: a solitary queen She rul'd, and rang'd, her shady empire round. No horn the silent huntress bears; no hound, With noisy cry, disturbs her solemn chace, Swift, as the bounding stag, she wings her pace; And, bend when-e'er she will her ebon bow, A speedy death arrests the flying foe. The bow the hunting goddess first supply'd, And ivory quiver cross her shoulders ty'd. The imperious queen of heaven, with jealous eyes, Beholds the blooming virgin from the skies, At once admires, and dreads, her growing charms, And sees the god already in her arms: In vain, she finds, her bitter tongue reproves His broken vows, and his clandestine loves: Jove still continues frail: and all in vain Does Thule in obscurest shades remain, While Maja's son, the thunderer's winged spy, Informs him where the lurking beauties ly. What sure expedient then shall Juno find, To calm her fears, and ease her boding mind? Delays to jealous minds a torment prove; And Thule ripens every day for love. She mounts her car, and shakes the silken reins; The harness'd peacocks spread their painted trains, And smooth their glossy necks against the sun: The wheels along the level Azure run. Eastward the goddess guides her gaudy team, And perfects, as she rides, her forming scheme. The various orbs now pass'd, adown the steep Of heaven the chariot whirls, and plunges deep In fleecy clouds, which o'er the mid-land main Hang pois'd in air, to bless the isles with rain: And here the panting birds repose a-while: Not so their queen; she gains the Cyprian isle, By speedy Zephyrs borne in thickned air: Unseen she seeks, unseen she finds, the fair. Now o'er the mountain tops the rising sun Shot purple rays: now Thule had begun Her morning chace, and printed in the dews Her fleeting steps. The goddess now pursues, Now over-takes her in the full career, And flings a javelin at the flying deer. Amaz'd, the virgin huntress turns her eyes; When Juno, (now Diana in disguise,) Let no vain terrours discompose thy mind; My second visit, like my first, is kind. Thy ivory quiver, and thy ebon bow, Did not I give?âHere sudden blushes glow On Thule's cheeks: her busy eyes survey The dress, the crescent, and her doubts give way. I own thee, goddess bright, the nymph replies, Goddess, I own thee, and thy favours prize: Goddess of woods, and lawns, and level plains, Fresh in my mind thine image still remains. Then Juno, beauteous ranger of the grove, My darling care, fair object of my love, Hither I come, urg'd by no trivial fears, To guard thy bloom, and warn thy tender years. TRANSLATIONS. THE First Olympionique of PINDAR. To Hiero of Syracuse, victorious in the Horse-race. The ARGUMENT. The Poet praises Hiero for his justice, his wisdom, and his skill in musick. He likewise celebrates the horse that won the race, and the place where the Olympick Games were performed. From the place (namely Peloponnesus) he takes an occasion of digressing to the known fable of Tantalus and Pelops; whence, returning to Hiero, he sets forth the felicity of the Olympian Victors. Then he concludes by praying to the gods to preserve the glory and dignity of Hiero, admonishing him to moderation of mind, in his high station, and, lastly, glories in his own excellency in compositions of this kind. STROPHE I. Measures 18. Each element to water yields; And gold, like blazing fire by night, Amidst the stores of wealth that builds The mind aloft, is eminently bright: But if, my soul, with fond desire To sing of games thou dost aspire, As thou by day canst not descry, Through all the liquid waste of sky, One burnish'd star, that like the sun does glow, And cherish every thing below, So, my sweet soul, no toil divine, In song, does like the Olympian shine: Hence do the mighty poets raise A hymn, of every tongue the praise, The son of Saturn to resound, When far, from every land, they come To visit Hiero's regal dome, Where peace, where plenty, is for ever found: ANTISTROPHE I.

Lord of Sicilia's fleecy plains, He governs, righteous in his power, And, all excelling while he reigns, From every lovely virtue crops the flower: In musick, blossom of delight, Divinely skill'd, he cheers the night, As we are wont, when friends design To feast and wanton o'er their wine: But from the wall the Dorian harp take down, If Pisa, city of renown, And if the fleet victorious steed, The boast of his unrival'd breed, Heart-pleasing raptures did inspire, And warm thy breast with sacred fire, When late, on Alpheus' crouded shore, Forth-springing quick, each nerve he strain'd, The warning of the spur disdain'd, And swift to victory his master bore, EPODE I.

Thus Pelops spoke; nor was his fervent pray'r Pour'd forth in fruitless words, to waft in air: The deity his whole ambition grants; Nor shining car, nor coursers, now he wants: In the golden bright chariot new vigour he feels, Exulting in the horses' feet, Unwearied ever, ever fleet: STROPHE IV. Measures 18. OenomaÃ¼s, he triumphs o'er Thy prowess, and, to share his bed, Claims the bright maid; who to him bore Six princely sons, to manly virtues bred. Now, solemniz'd with steaming blood, And pious rites, near Alpheus' flood Intomb'd, he sleeps, where the altar stands, That draws the vows of distant lands: And round his tomb the circling racers strive; And round the wheeling chariots drive. In thy fam'd courses, Pelops, rise The Olympian glories to the skies, And shine afar: there we behold The stretch of manhood, strenuous, bold, In sore fatigues, and there the strife Of winged feet. Thrice happy he, Who overcomes! for he shall see Unclouded days, and taste the sweets of life, ANTISTROPHE IV. Measures 18. Thy boon, O victory! thy prize. The good that, in a day obtain'd, From day to day fresh joy supplies, Is the supreme of bliss to man ordain'd: But let me now the rider raise, And crown him with Ãolian lays, The victor's due: and I confide, Though every welcome guest were try'd, Not one, in all the concourse, would be found For fairest knowledge more renown'd, Nor yet a master more to twine, In lasting hymns, each wreathing line. The guardian god, who watchful guides Thy fortunes, Hiero, presides O'er all thy cares with anxious pow'r: And soon, if he does not deny His needful aid, my hopes run high To sing more pleasing, in the joyful hour, EPODE IV. Measures 16. On thy chariot, triumphant when thou shalt appear, And fly o'er the course with a rapid career, Tracing paths of language fair, As I to Cronion's sunny mount repair. Even now the muse prepares to raise, Her growth, the strongest dart of praise, For me to wield. Approv'd in other things, Do others rise, conspicuous: only Kings, High mounting, on the summit fix: There bound thy view, wide-spread, nor vainly try Farther to stretch the prospect of thine eye: Be, then, thy glorious lot to tread sublime, With steady steps, the measur'd tract of time: Be mine, with the prize-bearing worthies to mix, In Greece, throughout the learned throng, Proclaim'd unrival'd in my song. THE SECOND OLYMPIONIQUE. To Theron of Agrigentum, victorious in the Chariot Race. The ARGUMENT. He praises Theron king of Agrigentum, on account of the victory obtained in the Olympic Games, with a chariot and four horses, likewise for his justice, his hospitality, his fortitude, and the illustriousness of his ancestors; whose adventures are occasionally mentioned: then he interweaves digressions to Semele, Ino, Peleus, Achilles, and others, and describes the future state of the righteous and of the wicked. Lastly, he concludes with extolling his own skill in panegyrick, and the benevolence and liberality of Theron. STROPHE I. Measures 16. Sovereign hymns, whose numbers sway The sounding harp, what god, what hero, say, What man, shall we resound? Is not Pisa Jove's delight? And did not Hercules, with conquest crown'd, To him ordain The Olympiad for an army slain, Thank-offering of the war? And must we not, in Theron's right, Exert our voice, and swell our song? Theron, whose victorious car Four coursers whirl, fleeting along, To stranger-guests indulgent host, Of Agrigentum the support and boast, Cities born to rule and grace, Fair blossom of his antient race, ANTISTROPHE I. Measures 16. Worthies fore perplex'd in thought, Till wandering far they found, what long they sought, A sacred seat, fast by Where the stream does rapid run, And reign'd, of Sicily the guardian eye, When happy days, And wealth, and favour, flow'd, and praise, That in-born worth inflames. Saturnian Jove, O! Rhea's Son, Who o'er Olympus dost preside, And the pitch of lofty games, And Alpheus, of rivers the pride, Rejoicing in my songs, do thou Incline thine ear, propitious to my vow, Blessing, with a bounteous hand, The rich hereditary land EPODE I. Measures 10. Through their late lineage down. No power can actions pass'd, Whether deeds of right or wrong, As things not done recall, Not even time, the father, who produces all; Yet can Oblivion, waiting long, Gathering strength Through the length Of prosperous times, forbid those deeds to last: Such force has sweetly-healing joy The festering smart of evils to destroy, STROPHE II. Measures 16. When felicity is sent Down by the will supreme with full content: Thy Daughters, Cadmus, they Greatly wretched here below, Bless'd ever more, this mighty truth display. No weight of grief, But, whelm'd in pleasures, finds relief, Sunk in the sweet abyss. Thou, Semele, with hair a-flow, Thou by thunder doom'd to dy, Mingling with the gods in bliss, Art happy, for ever, on high: Thee Pallas does for ever love, Thee chiefly Jupiter, who rules above; Thee thy son holds ever dear, Thy son with the ivy-wreathed spear. ANTISTROPHE II. Measures 16. Beauteous Ino, we are told, With the sea-daughters dwells of Nereus old, And has, by lot, obtain'd Lasting life, beneath the deep, A life within no bounds of time restrain'd. The hour of death, The day when we resign our breath, That offspring of the sun, Which bids us from our labours sleep, In vain do mortals seek to know, Or who destin'd is to run A life unintangled with woe; For none are able to disclose The seasons of the uncertain ebbs and flows Now of pleasures, now of pains, Which hidden fate to men ordains: EPODE II. Measures 10. Thus providence, that to thy ancestry, long-famed, Portions out a pleasing share Of heaven-sprung happiness, Does, ceasing in another turn of time to bless, Distribute some reverse of care, As from years Pass'd appears, Since the predestin'd son, at Pytho named, Did Laius, blindly meeting, kill, And the oracle, of old pronounc'd, fulfil: STROPHE III. Measures 16. Fell Erinnys, quick to view The deed, his warlike sons in battle slew, Each by the other's rage: But to Polynices slain Surviv'd Thersander, glory of his age, For feats of war, And youthful contests, honour'd far, The Scion, kept alive To raise the Adrastian house again: From whence Ãnesidamus' heir Does his spreading root derive, To branch out a progeny fair; Who, springing foremost in the chace Of fame, demands we should his triumph grace, Tuning lyres to vocal lays, Sweet union of melodious praise; ANTISTROPHE III. Measures 16. For not only has he borne The Olympian prize, but, with his brother, worn The garland of renown At Pytho and at Isthmus; where, Victorious both, they shar'd the allotted crown, Joint-honour, won In twelve impetuous courses, run With four unwearied steeds. To vanquish in the strife severe Does all anxiety destroy: And to this, if wealth succeeds With virtues enamell'd, the joy Luxuriant grows; such affluence Does glorious opportunities dispense, Giving depth of thought to find Pursuits which please a noble mind, EPODE III. Measures 10. Refulgent star! to man the purest beam of light! The possessor of this store, Far-future things discerning, knows Obdurate wretches, once deceas'd, to immediate Woes Consign'd, too late their pains deplore; For below 'E're they go, Sits one in judgment, who pronounces right On crimes in this wide realm of Jove; Whose dire decree no power can e'er remove: STROPHE IV. Measures 16. But the good, alike by night, Alike by day, the sun's unclouded light Beholding, ever bless'd, Live an unlaborious life, Nor anxious interrupt their hallow'd rest With spade and plow, The earth to vex, or with the prow The briny sea, to eat The bread of care in endless strife. The dread divinities among The few unaccustom'd to wrong, Who never broke the vow they swore, A tearless age enjoy for ever-more; While the wicked hence depart To torments which appall the heart: ANTISTROPHE IV. Measures 16. But the souls who greatly dare, Thrice try'd in either state, to persevere From all injustice pure, Journeying onward in the way Of Jupiter, in virtue still secure, Along his road Arrive at Saturn's rais'd abode; Where soft sea-breezes breathe Round the island of the bless'd; where gay The trees with golden blossoms glow; Where, their brows and arms to wreathe, Bright garlands on every side blow; For, springing thick in every field, The earth does golden flowers spontaneous yield; And, in every limpid stream, The budding gold is seen to gleam: EPODE IV. Measures 10. Fair heritage! by righteous Rhadamanth's award; Who, coÃ«qual, takes his seat With Saturn fire divine, Thy consort, Rhea, who above the rest dost shine, High-thron'd, thou matron-goddess great: These among (Blissful throng!) Does Peleus and does Cadmus find regard; And, through his mother's winning prayer To Jove, Achilles dwells immortal there: STROPHE V. Measures 16. He who Hector did destroy, The pillar firm, the whole support, of Troy, And Cycnus gave to dy, And Aurora's Ãthiop son. My arm beneath yet many darts have I, All swift of flight, Within my quiver, sounding right To every skilful ear: But, of the multitude, not one Discerns the mystery unexplain'd. He transcendent does appear In knowledge, from nature who gain'd His store: but the dull-letter'd croud, In censure vehement, in nonsense loud, Clamour idly, wanting skill, Like crows, in vain, provoking still ANTISTROPHE V. Measures 16. The celestial bird of Jove: But, to the mark address thy bow, nor rove. My soul: and whom do I Single out with fond desire, At him to let illustrious arrows fly? My fix'd intent, My aim, on Agrigentum bent, A solemn oath I plight, Sincere as honest minds require, That through an hundred circling years, With recorded worthies bright, No rivalling city appears To boast a man more frank to impart Kind offices to friends with open Heart, Or, with hand amidst his store, Delighting to distribute more EPODE V. Measures 10. Than Theron: yet foul calumny, injurious blame, Did the men of rancour raise Against his fair renown, Defamers who by evil Actions strove to drown His good, and to conceal his praise. Can the sand, On the strand, Be number'd o'er? Then, true to Theron's fame, His favours showering down delight On thousands who is able to recite? The First ODE of Anacreon. On his Lute. The line of Atreus will I sing; To Cadmus will I tune the string: But, as from string to string I move, My lute will only sound of Love. The cords I change through every screw, And model the whole lute anew. Once more, in song, my voice I raise, And, Hercules, thy toils I praise: My lute does still my voice deny, And in the tones of love reply. Ye heroes then, at once farewel: Loves only echo from my shell. The SECOND ODE. On WOMEN. Nature the bull with horns supplies, The horse with hoofs she fortifies, The fleeting foot on hares bestows, On lions teeth, two dreadful rows! Grants fish to swim, and birds to fly, And on their skill bids men rely. Women alone defenceless live, To women what does nature give? Beauty she gives instead of darts, Beauty, instead of shields, imparts; Nor can the sword, nor fire, oppose The fair, victorious where she goes. The THIRD ODE. On LOVE. One midnight when the bear did stand A-level with BoÃ¶tes' hand, And, with their labour sore oppress'd, The race of men were lay'd to rest, Then to my doors, at unawares, Came Love, and tried to force the bars. Who thus assails my doors, I cry'd? Who breaks my slumbers? Love reply'd, Open: a child alone is here! A little child!âyou need not fear: Here through the moonless night I stray, And, drench'd in rain, have lost my way. Then mov'd to pity by his plight, Too much in haste my lamp I light, And open: when a child I see, A little child, he seem'd to me; Who bore a quiver, and a bow; And wings did to his shoulders grow. Within the hearth I bid him stand, Then chafe and cherish either hand Between my palms, and wring, with care, The trickling water from his hair. Now come, said he, no longer chill, We'll bend this bow, and try our skill, And prove the string, how far its pow'r Remains unslacken'd by the show'r. He bends his bow, and culls his quiver, And pierces, like a Breez, my liver: Then leaping, laughing, as he fled, Rejoice with me, my host, he said: My bow is sound in every part, And you shall rue it at your heart. The Fourth Ode of ANACREON. On HIMSELF. Hither Loves and Myrtles bring; Tender Harvest of the Spring: Soft and cool, my Limbs recline; While I give my Self to Wine. LOVE (his flowing Mantle bound, With a Sedge, his Neck around) LOVE Himself shall fill the Bowl: For Life, hastening to the Goal, Passes with a rapid Trill; Swift, as whirls the Chariot Wheel: And, our Bones to moulder lain, We, a little Dust, remain. Why Ointments on my Stone bestow? Vainly, why, the Ground bestrow? Ointments on Me Living shed; Roses cluster round my Head; And, oh, bring my Charmer here! Let me, e'er I disappear, E'er, O LOVE, I Thither go, Where they sing and dance, Below; Let me, while I live, prepare; Let me banish e'ery Care. ANACREON. Ode 34. Why so Coy, my lovely Maid? Why of Age so much Afraid? Your Cheeks, like Roses, to the Sight; And my Hair, as Lillies white; In Love's Garland, we'll suppose Me the Lilly, you the Rose. ANACREONTIQUE. Beneath the Covert of a Grove, The conscious Scene of all my Love, Careless, and supinely lay'd, I took my Lute, and Sung and Play'd. Of Love's soft Passion did I sing, And Cupid; Love's Almighty King; When lo! a String, that would have spoke, Beneath my Finger, sighing broke; It broke, and said, methoughts, to me, Think on thy own Mortality,â [Thou speakest always ill of me] Thou speakest always ill of me, I speak always well of thee: But, spite of all our noise and pother, The world believes nor one nor t'other. An Hymn to VENUS, from the Greek of SAPPHO. I O Venus, beauty of the skies, To whom a thousand temples rise, Gayly false in gentle smiles, Full of love-perplexing wiles, O goddess! from my heart remove The wasting cares and pains of love. II If ever thou hast kindly hear'd A song in soft distress prefer'd, Propitious to my tuneful vow, O gentle goddess! hear me now. Descend thou bright, immortal, guest, In all thy radiant charms confess'd. III Thou once didst leave almighty Jove, And all the golden roofs above: The car thy wanton sparrows drew; Hov'ring in air they lightly flew; As to my bower they wing'd their way, I saw their quiv'ring pinions play. IV The birds dismiss'd (while you remain) Bore back their empty car again: Then you, with looks divinely mild, In ev'ry heav'nly feature smil'd, And ask'd, what new complaints I made, And why I call'd you to my aid? V What frenzy in my bosom rag'd, And by what care to be asswag'd? What gentle youth I would allure, Whom in my artful toils secure? Who does thy tender heart subdue, Tell me, my Sappho, tell me who? VI Tho now he shuns thy longing arms, He soon shall court thy slighted charms; Tho now thy off'rings he despise, He soon to thee shall sacrifice; Tho' now he freez, he soon shall burn, And be thy victim in his turn. VII Celestial visitant, once more Thy needful presence I implore! In pity come and ease my grief, Bring my distemper'd soul relief: Favour thy suppliant's hidden fires, And give me all my heart desires. A Fragment of Sappho. I Bless'd as the immortal gods is he, The youth who fondly sits by thee, And hears and sees thee all the while Softly speak and sweetly smile. II 'Twas this depriv'd my soul of rest, And rais'd such tumults in my breast; For while I gaz'd, in transport toss'd, My breath was gone, my voice was lost. III My bosom glow'd; the subtle flame Ran quick through all my vital frame; O'er my dim eyes a darkness hung, My ears with hollow murmurs rung. IV In dewy damps my limbs were chill'd, My blood with gentle horrors thrill'd; My feeble pulse forgot to play, I fainted, sunk, and dy'd away. The TEA-POT; or, The Lady's Transformation. A new Poem By Mr. Philips. Soft Venus, Love's too anxious Queen. In fit of Vapours or of Spleen, Because, perhaps, a fav'rite God Fail'd to return her smile or nod, Or that Her Mars of late groun cold, Behav'd less Kindly than of old, With inward sullen discontent, To Juno utter'd this Complaint. âThere lives a Nymph below the Skies, âThat Carries Witchcraft in her Eyes, âNo fond Addresses will she take âFrom Lovers of a Mortal make: âBut turns her haughty Looks above âPerhaps to Mars, perhaps to Jove; âDisdaining Men she seems to mark âNone less than an Aetherial Spark, âAnd of't you know We've born Disgrace, âDespis'd for those of Human Race. âIf more such Nymphs get leave to Reign, âOur Empire we shall ne'er maintain, âBut Goddesses resign their Birth, âTo the bright Morts who ply on Earth. So Venus spoke with Envy fir'dâ The other Jealousie inspir'd, And red with Rage, and big with Hate, She thus pronounc'd the Virgin's fate, âShe whose aspiring thoughts can rise, âTo Tempt a Rival in the Skies, âWho thus with Stubborn Pride neglects âTh'Addresses of the Kindred Sex. âInto a Tea-pot's Figure throun âShall still attend and serve her Own. When now, her Doom was fix'd the Maid, Before a Glass her Form survey'd. Her Eyes that o'er her beauties range, Too soon perceive the fatal Change; She sees, she feels the dire Decay; Grows cold and stiffens into Clay; Extinguish'd bye the vital Fires, And every crimson Blush retires. The Well turn'd Waste in Canvas bound, Shrunk to a little hollow round: The Iv'ry Arm that in her side, By chance she plac'd with comely Pride. By Fate was in that Posture held And in a Handle's form congeal'dâ Amaz'd with Horror and Surprise She Lifts to Heaven her Watry Eyes; Unpitying Heavenâand Oh! She criedâ Her Mouth grew circular and wide Her Lips, that once outvied the Rose, Turn pale and in a Cover Close. Her Tongue, which last in health remain'd, And last its Suppleness retain'd. With usual Pliance nimbly slips To feel the Change, between her Lips, But loosing there all Power to move, Appears a Little knob above, Which Helps as formerly to hide, Seldom to hide the interior Side. But what was chang'd in to the Spout, The cautious Muse resolves with Doubt. Uncertain whether 'twere the Nose, Because from thence a Liquid flows. Or Eyes because they oft reveal'd, What hidden things the Lips conceal'dâ Howe'r it was, by Juno's Hand, The Nymph a finish'd Teapot stands. Now from the High Coelestial Plain The Goddesses Confederate lean, And with malitious Triumph they Their Monument of Wrath survey; Upon a stricter View they find Some Parts remain unchang'd behind, And with those Relicts of their Rage, They furnish out an Equipageâ Part of the Scull, well temper's Clay, Fell off and in a Slop-Dish lay: Her polish'd Forehead being thought Good Mettal, into Spoons were wrought. Holes in the Heart where Secrets lay, Became Receptacles for Tea, The Tea as Secrets did of old Drops out again before 'tis cold. Her Lungs another Form receive And in respiring Bellows heave The Bellows still delight to blow Coals that beneath the Kettle Glow. The DEATH of the JUST. Oh happy Hour, when the unshackled Soul Free from the clog of dull mortality Shall leave this muddy earth and soar to Heaven Soon as the Appointed term of Life expires Fixed in the Records of Eternity. The Sovereign Arbiter of Heaven and Earth Strait calls a bright angelick squadron forth And gives the great Command âYe sons of Light âBring home yon dying Saint.â With joy they go Immediate, with immeasurable speed, From heavens eternal Domes they wing. Meanwhile the Soul on the thin Edge of Life, Sits ready to receive the heavenly summons. The dying Pulse now beats the last alarm Then fails at once. And now the soul forsakes Th'untenantable Abode, and takes its Flight. With joy the Angelick convoy strait receive And guard it round. The Prince of Hell in vain Gnashes his iron teeth; and all the Powers Of Darkness filled with Rage behold and pine: Fain would they intercept the heavenly Flight But dare not, quell'd with terror from above. Now th'unembodied Saint leaves this low Earth Which lessens in the view, with Joy and Wonder And Pity on this grovelling World looks down From the exalted Height; âFarewell vain World And ye delusive Joys: Are these the things That charm fond Mortals? Farewell all my Sorrows, Gladly I leave with you my Sins behind.â Then Joyful it ascends. Its noblest powers All in a Moment strength'ned and enlarg'd Free from each claim of Sin and full of God. The scales that here spread o'er the mortal Eye Fall off at once; the now enlightened love Sees far and wide, beyond the utmost ken Of Mortal Flight, still bright'ning as it goes. Thousands of new Ideas sudden throng Into th'enlarged Mind; the Universe In its capacious sphere all open lies. A thousand shining worlds at once appear. The disencumbered soul with vast Delight Now wonders at itself; then looks about Wondering at all things round; the lucid skies Which here on Earth like twinkling atoms seem'd Fix'd in the azure Firmament of Heaven, Now nigh at hand appear huge worlds of light Hanging in fluid Aether; while around Attendant Planets in bright order move With Mutual Attractions, and observe Constant, God's great original command. And now arriv'd upon the milky way (So mortals call the high aethereal Road) All pav'd with bright innumeral stars Which mingling Blazes cast a doubtful Light To those that from Earth's distant turret's gaze, There the triumphant Soul astonished flies From Orb to Orb; nor yet does lose its way; Born by its heavenly Guide with swiftest speed Safe through the vast immensity of Space; Whilst all along the airy Habitants, That in the boundless Fields of Aether stray Salute th'illustrious stranger as it goes. And now behold the Empyreal Haven appears Resplendent Palace of the eternal being; For though his mighty Essence infinite Transcends all Bounds of Space, he there displays His brightest Beams, there keeps his blessed Court With millions of adoring Angels crown'd. All far and wide the dazzling glories shine: Transported with the view, the eager soul Still as it nearer draws its joyful Pace Quickens, and with seraphic ardour burns. Hark now the heavenly music fills its ears It feels unwonted Vigor and afresh Springs up, enchanted with the new Delight. Now the celestial convoy safe arriv'd Deliver their blessed charge, which straight appears Accountable before the Throne of God, And there with awful Reverence prostrate fall Meanwhile the great Emmanuel who enthroned In sociate glory with the Father sits To him presents the joyful trembling soul And now the sovereign Power gives the word; âWell done thou faithful Servant, enter now Into the Master's Joy: here safe abide In these resplendent Mansions full of light, Waiting the glorious Resurrection day. The happy sentence past, without delay Th'enfranchised soul its joyful station takes Among the perfect Spirits of the Just Bless'd seraphs now rejoice and kindred saints Sing holy anthems: This they did before, Upon its first conversion here on Earth. And now again with heightened joys they sing Ten thousand Welcomes to the happy Guest Then all in grateful Hallelujahs join To God and to the Lamb. The new come Soul Soon learns the heavenly airs and bears its part In that celestial Concert, all inflam'd With pure Immortal Love; It's Life is Love. No longer now it tastes the distant stream But, glad, approaches to the Fount of Life There sweetly plunges in extatick joys, Lost in a vast immensity of Bliss. There God is All in All, Supreme of Beings Whose Glories who can tell? The Great Three-One Before Whose Throne the prostrate seraphim Veiling their dazzled Eyes with gorgeous Wings Intranced in everlasting Raptures lie. And there Divine Immanuel sits enthron'd Bless'd Image of paternal Deity In whom th'insufferable Glory shines Sweetly attempted to created view, And fills the boundless Realms with Light and Joy. No sun is there to shine, or did the sun Mere shed its Beams, he soon would disappear Lost in superior splendours and abashed Hide his diminish'd Head like the dim Light Of earthly glowworms, or the glimmering Blaze Of Tapers in the Sun's meridian Ray. In these bless'd Regions th'unembody'd soul Triumphant dwells, waiting the happy time When the deserted Body, its Partner dear Which now lies smouldering in gloomy grave Death's Captive, shall incorruptible arise In Glory with celestial Radiance clad. All after that is one eternal Day, An undisturbed scene of endless joys And bless'd seraphic Raptures ever new. And now all Praise be to that Saviour given Who when the earthly Eden we had lost To new transcendent glories hath advanc'd Our fallen nature and hath open'd wide Heaven's everlasting Doors: cheerful to Thee I yield myself; Make me for ever Thine Apply the glorious Merit of Thy Blood And the sweet Powers of Thy Celestial Grace. Then welcome Death, the short but gloomy Path To that bright World above. Shall I now fear thee? Where is thy sting? The grisly Terror once Of Nature, now becomes the highest Gain. O for a lively Faith! some sweet foretaste Of those celestial Joys! Then will I bid This flatt'ring world adieu and take my flight, Leaving my Sins and Sorrow in Thy Grace.</field>
