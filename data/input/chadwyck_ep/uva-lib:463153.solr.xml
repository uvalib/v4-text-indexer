      <field name="fulltext">HERE Begynneth the Scole house of women: wherein euery man may reade a goodly prayse of the condicyons of women. The prouerbe olde, who so denieth In my conceyte, doth greatly arre Both wyt and dyscrecyon, yl he applyeth That thynge of treueth, wolde debarre Howe be it that folke, presume so farre Wherby the treweth, is often blamed Yet in no wyse, treweth may be shamed. A fole of late, contryued a boke And all in prayse of the femynye Who so taketh laboure, it to out loke Shal proue, all is but flaterye Pehan he calleth it, it maye well be The Pecocke is prowdest, of hys fayre tayle And so ben all women, of theyr apparayle. Wherfore as nowe, in thys treatyse What so be sayde, in rude sentence Uertue to increase, and to lay vyce Is chefe occasion, of my pretence And where that treweth is, is none offence Who so therfore, that blameth me I saye he demeth wrongfullye. Percha?ce the women, take displeasure Bycause I rubbe them, on the gall To them that good be, paraduenture It shall not be materyall The other sorte, no force at all Say what they wyll, or bendeth the brewe Them selfe shall proue, my saynge trewe. Eche other man, in generall And name those that maryed be Gyue euident, testimonyall Affermynge the same, yf I wolde lye And thus reporte, that femynye Ben euyll to please, and worse to truste Crabbed &amp; comberous, when them selfe luste. Haue tonge at large, voyce loude &amp; shryl Of wordes wounderous, passynge store Stomacke stoute, with frowarde wyll And namely, when ye touche the sore With one bare worde, or lyttell more Thee flusshe and flame, as hote as fyre And swell as a tode for feruent yre. And where they here, one word y? so?deth Lyttell agaynst; theyr lewede behauyoure And twyse so moche els, whiche y? redoundeth To theyr hye prayse, ye maye be sure So lyght of eare they be and sowre That of the better, they neuer recorde The worse reherse they, worde by worde. It were moche hurte, for to dyscrye The propertyes all, of the feminie kynde Howe be it a man maye, coniecture nye And saye also, as experyence doth bynde That very fewe, there be to fynde But that thei can, how so euer the mater st?de Bere fyre and water, bothe in one hande. Enuacyons they haue, faynt and feble Them to excuse, of duplicite As thoughe, they were, inuencible Spotted, in any wyse to be And with othes so craftelye They shal be forgyd, on suche a grounde As all thynge were, both hole and sounde, And be it in earnyst, or els in Iape Lo to them it is, one maner of thynge Surely nought els, they after gape But euermore, in comminge To let a man, of hys sayenge Reason wyll they not attende But tell theyr owne tale to the ende. And for to saye, most commonly Thys vyce, is appropryat to them all For let a man, to them replye In reasonyng, of matters small These women, be so sensuall That by theyr reason, not worth a torde Yet wyll the woman, haue the last worde. There maye no reason, theyrs debarre Nor none example, can them conuerte They stody algate, to be at warre And wyth euyll sawes, to be ouerthwarde Malyce is so rooted, in theyr harte That seldome a man, maye of them here One good worde in a whole longe yere. Albeit the nombre, of them are great Yet doth theyr foly, farre excede For all is fysshe, that commeth to net In case that they of theyr mynde spede Broche rynge, cloth or threde Shame haue they none, to terre or snatche All is theyr owne, that the maye catche. Wat so it be, they fenger ones Of wedded man, or syngle playne He may as soone eate, the Adamunde stone As the selfe same, of them to retayne Moche they craue, and nought gyue agayne As holsome for a man, is a womans corse As a shulder of motton, for a sycke horse. And yet we may not, them longe mysse For many sondry, commodytyes So trycke a waye, they haue to kysse With open mouthe, and rowlynge iyes Tongue to tongue, dyscole-thyes One and other, commonlye Haue in such case, lyke propertye. That harde it were, in myne opynyon If god hym selfe, wolde company kepe But that wolde, brynge hym vpon Wakynge, or els a slepe Dysplease them ones, and then they wepe By meane wherof, sone doth the cure Yonge fooles to kepe, longe in vre. And while, the woynge tyme doth last I miane with then, that maydens be Loth to displease, loue sure and fast Are what ye wyll, and spede maye ye Fewe or none, for the moste partye Gently entreated, deny you can Within her tables, to enter your man. That done they saye, that ye dyd make Promysse to them, by good assurance Them to mary, and to wyues take Els had ye not, had suche dalyaunce And all is for feare, of good vtteraunce In case the bely, do not swell They holde them pleased, and all is well. Yet muste ye be, at farther daunger If ye do entende to vse them ofte Kepe them bothe at racke, and maunger Arraye them well, and laye them softe Yet shall another man, come alofte Haue you ones turned, your iye and backe An other she wyl haue, to smycke and smacke. Perchaunce the bely, may ryse wyth all Then wyll they swere, and steare a pase That thyne is it, when it doth fall Be it malary borne or base Loke they saye, on thyne owne face Beholde well, bothe nose ?d iye Nature it selfe, the father wyll trye. And other there is, to synguler grace Gyuen vnto the babe, for the one Or sure it is, a maruelous face That god hath gyuen, vnto the mone For were thy .xx. they muste eche one Loke the streyght, eyther els a shore Be lyke the father, lesse and more. And when they are ones, waxen swall And able to ryde, or els to go Unto lyke acte, agayne they fall As who wolde saye, you felte no wo Yf ye renounce, kindenes to sho Then must ye send th?, to some straunge place As good a mayde, as she before was Then yf theyr come, a louer newe And them appoynte whyter to come They be lyke redy vnto the mewe And to be close, from wynde and sonne With lyttell laboure, they are soone wonne Not one I warrant you, amonges twentye But she efte sones, wyll be as redye. Wed them ones, and then adewe Farewell al truste, and huswyferye Kepe theyr chambres, and them selfe mewe For staninge of her fysnamye And in theyr bed, all daye do lye Muste ones or twyse, euery weke Fayne them selfe, for to besycke. Send for thys, and sende for that Lyttell or nothynge, may them please Come in good gossyp, and kepe me that I trust it shall do me great ease Complayne of many a sondry dyssease A gossyps cuppe, betwene vs twayne Tyll she begotten vp agayne. Then must she haue, mayd?s two or thre That may then gossyps, togyter brynge Set them to laboure, to blere the iye Them selfe wyll nother, wasshe ne wrynge Bake ne brewe, nor other thinge Syt by the fyre, let the maydens trot Brewe of the best, in a halfpeny pot. Playe who wyll, the man must laboure And brynge to house, all that he may The wyfe agayne, doth nought but glauoure And holde him vp, with ye and nay But of her cuppe, he shall not assay Other she sayeth, it is to thyn Or els ywys, there is nothyng in. And when these gossyps, are ones met Of euery tale, and newe tydinge They bable fast, and nothynge forget They put I warrant, betwene rydynge Thus lerne the yonger, of the elders guiding Day by day, kepynge suche scoles The symple men, the make as foles. Them selfe alway, do make good chere With one or other, they neuer rest Our Iohn shall pay, that is not best Howe say ye gossyp, is it not best I beshrewe his hert, nowe is he blest He bette me gossyp, I may tell you That yet I am both blacke and blewe. Thus out it shall, what so it be Good or badde, all is one thynge Who so euer commeth to memorye Shal not he loke, for the tellynge God wot they make, many a lesynge It doth theyr stomacke, greatly ease To serue what may, theyr husb?des displease. The yonge complayneth vnto the olde Somwat to ease, theyr hertes therby The elder sayth, good gooshyp be bolde To shewe your mynde, wholly to me Fere it not, ye knowe pardye That I haue ben, bath olde and yonge Both close and sure, of tayle and tonge. Than sayth the yonger, I may tell you I am so matched, as no woman is Of all thys night, tyll the cocke crewe He wolde not ones turne, me for to kysse Euery nyght he ryseth to pysse And whan he commeth, agayne vnwarme Doth turne his ars, in to my harme. Lappeth hym selfe, rounde all aboute And thrusteth me out of my place Leueth me scandly, one rage or cloute To couer and cast, ouer my face Ful lyttell maner, gossyp he hase The moste vnkyndest, man haue I That euer woman, layde her by. And he the daye, neuer so longe He doth nothyng, but chyde and brawle yee yee gossyp, the more is my wronge Hore and harlot, he doth me call And byddes me gossyp, scrappe and scrall And for my lyuynge, labour and swete For as of hym, no peny, I gete. I was a curste, or els starke mad And when I maryed, wyth hym vnwyse I may tell you, I myght haue had Another maner of man, then he is If I had folowed, my frendes aduyse I shulde haue had a mynyan A man of lande, a gentilman. The deuyll gossyp, ought me a shame And prayde I am nowe, euerye penye I wolde god he had, be blinde and lame The daye and houre, he fyrste woed me Ware not gossyp, these chyldren thre I wolde not tary, ye may be sure Longer with hym, daye ne houre. Than sayth the elder, do as I do Be sharpe and quicke, wyth hym agayne If that he chyde, chyde you also. And for one worde, gyue hym twayne Kepe hym shorte, and haue disdayne He shulde vse you, after suche rate. Byd hym be styll, wyth on euell date. Cherysshe your selfe, all that ye maye And drawe vnto, good company Cast not your selfe, gossyp a waye Bycause he playeth, the churle with the And by your wyll, kepe hym hungrye And byd hym go, when he wolde game Unto his customers, god gyue hym shame. Be euer with hym, at yea and naye And by your wyll, begyn the warre If he wolde smyte, then maye ye saye Go to hartely, yf thou so dare I beshrewe thy herte, yf that thou spare All the worlde, shall wonder on the Howe thou dost wreke, thy tene of me. Bycause thou hast be, at the dyse And playde awaye, all that thou hast Or from thy gyllottes, thou coulde not ryse Of all thys daye, ye sat so fast And nowe god gyue the shame at last Commest dronken home, with a myschefe And woldest be reuenged, vpon thy wyfe. Better ywys, to holde thy hande And more for thyne honestye I had leuer thy necke, were in a bande Than I wolde take it, longe of the. Truste me I will fynde, remedye Smyte and thou dare, I make god auowe I wyll quyte it, I wote well howe. In case there be, no remedye But that ye muste, haue strokes sadde Take vp the babe, that then is nye Be it whence, or be it ladde And byd hym stryke, yf he be madde Smyte hardely, and kyll thy sone And ange therfore, when thou hast done. Thus euer among, they kepe such scoles The yonge to drawe, after the olde Motynge euer, vppon theyr stoles Of euery matter, that they haue wolde By meane wherof, the yonge waxe bolde So that within, a moneth they be Quarter mayster, or more then he. Truly some men, there be That lyue alwaye, in great honoure And saye it goeth, by destenye To hange or wed, both hath but one houre And whether it be, I am well sure Hangynge is better, of the twayne Sooner done, and shorter payne. On pilgremage, then must they go To wylsdon, barkynge, or to some allowes Perchaunce be forth, a night or two One fote for weringe, or horse showes A vyage make, vnto the stewes And neyther knele, to stones ne stockes But the offerynge take, with a quycke boxe. Somtyme also, licence they craue To be w? some neighbour, ? the mydwiues stede And all to the ende, some other knaue Shall dubbe, her husbande, a sommer byrde The trewth is knowen, it can not be hydde Albeyt that fewe men, do hym here The Kocko syngeth, euery yere. They haue also, another cast In case the husbande, be present The childe I warrant, shall be bast And to her louer, ther with sent The sely man, none euill ment Regardeth lyttell, or nothynge this Howe by the babe, she sendes her kys And for she wolde, be rekened trewe The matter to cloke, more craftelye Her kynsman call hym, I warrant you And all to blere, the husbandes iye God wote the blynde, eateth many a flye So doth the husbande, often ywys Father the chylde, that is not his. Trym them selfe, euery daye newe And in their glasses, pore and prye Plat and plant, and their herles hewe And all to make it, for the iye The fynesse ware, that thei maye bye And all that euer, they may ymagyne Is to enlure, the masculyne. Plant them rounde, with many a pyn Rynged for to routing, of pure golde Fayre without, and foule within and of theyr tayles, haue slypper holde Bye who wyll, ware wyll be solde Ye nede go no farther, the fayre is here. Bye when ye lyst, it lasteth ouer yere. Spare for no cost, but drynke of the best and also, of euery deyntye eate Hote in operacyon, and lyght to dygest Nature to prouoke, and set on a heate Oysters, Kocles, &amp; els what they may gete Now this, now that, and fayne them selfe sicke Such thynges to receyue, as for the phisicke. By meanes, wherof, Tyresyas arbyther chose, the trewth to dyscus Gyue Iudgement playne, in thys case That the woman is farre more lecherous Gallus galinus ter quinq? suffecit vnus Set ther quinq? viri Non sufficiunt muleri. In case they wolde, ought of you craue a none they wepe, or lowre a pase and say that they, can nothyng haue Them to apparell, as other wyues hase Trust not ouer moche, theyr mornynge face Recorde ynaught, of Sampsons two wyues Who foloweth their myndes, seldom thryues. Albei the byrder with hys bleryed iye Dysemble sorowe with his sad face Yet is there no byrde, he maye come by By his engynest, that may haue grace By women is foloweth, in semblable case Wepe they or loughe they, all is one thynge They deale most craftly, when they be weping. And yet amonge, who so wyll thryue and office bere, in towne and citye Muste nedes be ruled, by his wyue Or els in fay, it wyll not be The wyfe muste able hym, to the degre able or vnable, lyttell careth she Bycause her selfe, wolde honoured be. Feare not she fayth, vnto her spouse a man or a mowse, whether be ye Shulde ye your honesty, refuse and be as lyke, as other men be In person, and in eche degre Take it vpon you, do not refuse and I my selfe, wyll fynde your house. So by the meane, of her counsayle The man maye not the office forsake Bycause the wyfe, wolde haue a tayle Come rakinge after, and a bonet blacke a veluet heade, and also be take With the best, and not the worste The man must be ruled, tyll al be in the dust. Of all the dyseases, that euer wore Weddynge is nexte, vnto the gowte a salue there is, for euery sore To helpe a man, within, or withoute But of these twayne, I am in dowte No payne so feruent, hote ne colde as is a man, to be called Cokolde. And be he neuer, so ferefull to fraye So starke a cowarde, yet wyll he rage And drawe his knyfe, euen strayght waye Be he neuer, so farre in age Call hym ones Cokolde, and hys corage Forth with wyl kindle, and force hym stryke Whorse then ye named him heretike. And syth, there is no salue therfore It putteth many, a man in fere To be infect, with the selfe same sore Howe well so euer, they them bere Good token haue they, also els where That who so euer, weddeth a wyfe Is sure of sorowe, all his lyfe. Of Socrates, the pacient Example good, of his wiues twayne Whiche on a tyme, fyll at dissent And vnto him, dyd them complayne He laughed therat, and they agayne Fall both on him, with and euyl date A pyspot they brake, vpon his pate. He helde hym pleased, and well content The pysse ran downe, by hys chekes twayne Wel wyst I (sayde he) what it ment And trewe it is that all men sayne That after thondre, commeth rayne Who hath a wyfe, is sure to fynde At home in hys house, many a sowe wynde. A certayne wyfe, sayde to me ones I wolde thou kneue it, god made vs Neyther of earth, stocke, ne stoens But of a thynge, moche precyous Of a ribbe of a man, scripture sayth thus Because the woman, in euery nede Shulde be helpe to the man, in worde &amp; dede. Man made of earth, and woman of man As of a thynge, moste principall Whiche argueth well, sayth she then By iudgemente iuste, and reason naturall That we be euer, substanciall And yet ye men, of vs bable That women alwayes, are varyable. Whiche thinge, as farre as I se can Shulde be employed, rather to you Syth of the earth, god create man And figures therof maketh euer newe Nature thus nature, me semeth nowe Must nedes, his first oryginall Ensewe, or be vnnaturall. As ye say (sayde I) helpe hym well Euyll to thryue, and worse to fare Who was the cause, that Adam fell His wyfe or no? I make you ware One and other, lyttell ye care So ye maye haue, that ye desyre Though dun, and the packe, lye in the myre. Made of a bone, ye sayde ye were Therwith it is, I can not denaye Crokyt it was, styffe and sturdye And that wolde bende, no maner of waye Of nature lyke, I dare well saye Of that condition, all women be Euyll to rule, both styffe and sturdye. And ouer that, who listeth to trye Put me two bones, in a bagge Or mo, as it is of quantyte That done, holde it somwhat sagge Sake it also, that it maye wagge And ye shall here, none other matter Of these bones, but clytter clatter. Lyke so of women, in felde and towne Assembled where that manye be A man may here them by the sowne Father farre, then thei ye maye se Wherfore men saye most commenlye Where many gese be, be many tordes And where be women, are many wordes. And so the husbande is lyke to haue A syngulyer treasure of hys wyfe He nedeth neuer; an yll worde to craue All the dayes; of hys longe lyfe Hath not that man, a perogatiue That maye alwaye, of hys wyfe haue A thynge of nought, and it not craue. And commonly, where cause is none. Some thynge ymagyned; is kept in store Whych that she may, come the good man home Wyth spytefull spyryte, laye hym before Of lytell or nought, they make muche more And be it true, or false they tell All is sothed, as the gospell. And yet the ryppe, as I suppose That god dyd take, out of the man A dogge vp caught, and away gose Eate it cleane, so that as than The worke to fynysshe, that god began Coulde not be as we haue sayde Bycause the dogge the rybbe conueyed. A remedy god founde as yet, Out of the dogge, he toke a rybbe The woman forthwyth, he made of it As to the man, neyther kynne nor sybbe Nature she foloweth, and playeth the gybbe And at her husbande, doth barke and ball As doth the curre, for nought at all Another reason, yf ye marke well Doth cause the woman, of wordes be riue A certayne man, as fortune fell A woman tongeles, wedded to wyue whose frouning co?tena?ce, perceiuing be liue Tyl he myght know what she ment, he thought longe And wysshed ful oft, she had a tonge. The deuyl was redy, and apered anone An aspin lefe, he had the man take And in her mouth, shulde put but one A tounge sayde the deuyll, it shall her make Tyll he had done, his heed dyd ake Leues he gathered, and toke plentye And in her mouth, put two or three. Within a while, the medicine wrought The man coulde, tary, no longer tyme But wakened her, to thende he mought The vertue proue, of the medicine The fyrste worde, she spake to hym She sayde thou horeson, knaue and thife How durst thou waken me, with a michsyfe. Fr? that day forwarde, she neuer ceased Her boyster bable, greued hym sore The deuyll he met, and hym entreated To make her tongles, as she was before Not so sayd the deuyll, I well medle nomore I deuyll a woman to speke may constrayne But all that in hell be, can not let it agayne. And by profe, daylye we se What inclynacyon, nature maketh The aspyn lefe, hangynge where it be With lytell wynde, or none it shaketh A womans tonge, in lyke wyse taketh Lyttel ease, and littel rest For yf it shulde, the herte wolde brest. Loke whan the see, doth water want Nor no wynde bloweth, the mylne to walke Then Ethna hyll, of fyre is scant The Crowe white, and blacke is chalke When women cease wyll, of theyr talke It is lyke propryed, all women to bable As dogges to barke, and geese to gagle. And that more is, all men saye That woman to man, is most comforte Howe be it they meane it, another waye And say she is, mannes vtter extorte And ouer that by iuste reporte The smaller pease, the mo to the pot. The fayrer woman, the more gyllot. The fayrer of face, the prouder of harte The lother to woo, the sooner won The lesse of speche, the more ouer thwarte Not one so daungerous, as is dame dun The fowler she is, the sooner it is done So shorte of hele, they be ouer al That and yf ye blowe, thy must nedes fal. By meane wherof, al men reporte And saye that women, can not be stable For be one gone, and an other resorte And profereth them, thynge seruiable Our fylye is setled, vnto the sadle Ryde who wyll, shod is our mare and thus they eschaunge, ware for ware. In case thou woldest not, haue it so But rather fynde, euery thynge wel I counsayle the, before thou go Forth of the towne, to crowche and knell And offre a candell, to the deuyll Parcase the wyfe, wolde be salewde He wolde for set it, al be shrewed. Example therof, that was thys A certayne man, from home shulde ryde whiche fearynge his wyfe, wolde do amys To an ymage of Sathan, vpon a wall syde Offered a candall, and that was espied And sayde syr Sathan, nowe I charge the My wyfe in myne absence, thou do ouer se Hys iorney ended, came home agayne And the selfe ymage, went strayght vnto The deuil hym shewed, euery thyng playne Howe he had let, that shulde haue be do And from her backwarde, drawen one or two The daungerest cure, that euer he had was to kepe good, that wolde haue he bad. Another thynge, as pryncipal Be not with her, in Ialosye what mysaduenture, so euer befall Forbyd her, no mannes companye Nor yet rebuke her syngulerlye In case thou do, though thou haddest sworne A blast shalt thou blowe, in Nynerus horne. For as we se, by experyence Euery daye, before our iye And by reporte, of men of credence For the moste parte, the femynye By theyr innatyue, destynye Fyrste and formest, when they be chyd wyll that thynge do, they be forbyd. And ouer that they wyse present I counsayle the, be wyse and ware Thou prayse no other mannes Instrument Better than thyne owne, berynge ware For yf thou do she wyll not spare Were it neuer, so naturall a foole Tyll she assayed, the selfe same toole. So frayle they be, of disposicion So croked, so crabbed, with that so euill So lewde, so shrewde, lyght of condicion That sure it ware vnpossible To let them, of there owne selfe will And but it come, of their owne mynde A m? were as good, throw stones at y? winde. Say what ye wyl, they wyll do as they lust The profe therof, in a certayne fable A husbande man hauinge good trust His wife to him, had be agreable Thought to attempt, yf she had be reformable Bad her take the potte, that sod ouer the fyre And set it aboue, vpon the astyre. She answered hym, I holde the mad And I more foole, by saynt Martyne Thy dyner is redy, as thou me bad And tyme it were, that thou shulde dyne And thou wyl not, I wyl go to myne I byd the sayde he, bere vp the potte A ha she sayde, I trowe thou dote. Up she goeth, for fere at last No question moued, where it shulde stande Upon hys heed, the potage she cast And helde the potte, styl in her hande And towarde hym, she curste and bande Sayde and sware, he myght her trust She wolde wyth the potage, do what her lust. No remedy, to discontent To pratle to them, of reason or lawe For be a womans purpose bent Nothing preuayled, to with drawe Nor yet to kepe them, vnder awe Gyue them counsaile, the best ye can They wyl folowe theyr owne wyl now &amp; than. Loke of discrecion, fewe womanly And to the were, fewe profitable Not thre I dare saye, amonge thyrty That be discrete, and reasonable And yet alwayes, the byble bable Of euery mater, and make it nyse And in conclusyon, be wonderous peuysshe. As holy saintes, in churche they be And in strete, as aungelles they where At home, for all theyr ypocrysye A deuyllysshe lyfe, they lede all the yere When lenton commeth, then to the frere The frere lymlyfter, for a praye of pence Wyll for all causes, with them dispence. And that more is, I dare auowe That yf thy wyfe, dyspleasure take Be it right or wronge, yet thou Muste nedes of force, for theyr wyues sake Fight and fraye, and hye wordes crake Swere and stare, as who wolde saye Thou woldest not let, to kyll and slaye. In case thou take, the matter lyght As a man of peace, loue and concorde Then wyll she wepe, anone forth ryght And gyue the many, and euyll worde and byd the gyrd, to the thy sworde and saye yf I, had maryed a mon This thynge shulde not, be longe vndon, Recorde, the wycked Iesabell whyche wolde haue slayne, good Helyas Recorde also, of the gospel The wyfe of phylip, Herodias whiche through her doughter, brought to pas That Herode her graunted, or that they wyst To gyue her the heed, of Iohn Baptist. Thus where them selfe, may littell do As in regard, of corporal myght Of cruelnesse, they rest not so But stere their husbandes, for to fyght The prouerbe olde, accordeth right women and dogges, causeth moche stryfe And most occasion, to be mischyfe. In case that thou, so folysshe be For thy wyues wordes, to make a brall Yf it so fortune, that she do it se Regardeth lytel, what may befal The fyrste thynge, that she doth of all On the she ronneth, and holdeth the styll whyles that an other, maye the kyll. And yf it chaunce, any vnkynde worde Escape thy mouth, wherby that ye Bytwene your selfe, fall at dyscorde Truste me wel, in case that she By any meane, maye mayster the For the moste parte, al women be In suche case, al without pytie. Weake and feble, albeit they be Of body moche impotent Example dayly, yet maye ye se Comberous they be, and malyuolent Harmeles creatures, none euyll ment The vpper hande, yf they ones get Can no more harme, then a Mermeset. Who was so busy, as the mayde With croked language, Peter to appose Ones, twyse, or thryse, to hym she sayde And thou felowe, arte one of those The trueth sayde she, thy language shose Peter abashed, swore and denayde And al by reason, of the lewde made. Some men there be also, that saye Be she syngle, or be she wedde To moche she couyteth, of chambre playe As dyd byblys, the thynge for bede Presumed to be, in her mothers stede Myrha also inordinatlye Wyth her owne father, founde meanes to lye. The doughters twayne, of Loth the sage Hauynge lyke tykle, in theyr tayle Coulde not refrayne, theyr wylful rage To satysfye, with euyl hayle Theyr father feasted, with costly vitayle Made hym dronke, and so at laste Medled with hym, he slepynge faste. Examples here of, diuers there be To a proue my sayeng, as strayght as a lyne As firste of the abhominable Pasiphe And then the insaciat missalyne Pyrra, Fabulla, and fayre Helyne Wyth other thousandes, many mo Whyche al to resyte, wolde neuer be do. I praye you why, was Adam shent Bycause he onely, dyd transgresse Eue hym meued, fyrst to consent To eate of the apple, she dyd hym dresse So all came, of her wylfulnes And syth that woman, that offence began She is more to blome, then is the man. The wyfe of Loth, wyllyng also The wyll of god, to preuarycate Out of the Cytye, whan she shulde go Loke behinde her, in her gate To se by profe, the pronostycate Dyspleased god and she anone Tr?sformed was, into a salt stone. I praye you what dyd quene Atthaly Loke in Paralypomenon Mother of yonge kynge Othozye Of all, and of all, the wylfullest one Moued the kynge a foresayde, her sonne To do moche euyll, especyallye The temple of god, for to dystroye. Myghty Sampson, two wyues had The fyrste a Phylystian, by generacyon Neyther of them good, but passynge bad And else to hym, farre out of fasshion The fyrste hym caused, by lacrymacyon Hys probleme to here so that he sayde When she it knewe, she hym be trayed. The seconde delde, moche worse then so Decyued hym, as ye shall here For she hys strenght, dyd take hym fro In her lappe slepynge, she clypte hys heere Betrayed her lorde, and her bewpere Thus dalyda, for mede hym serued And caused hys iyes, out to be carued. The wyfe of Iob, the man electe Saluted hym, with scornes and mockes And full vnsemely, oft hym checte Sayenge thou foole, full of the pockes Full lyke a foole, thy breste thou knockes Wenyst thou, for thy fayre speche God wyl come, the for to feche. Thy praytynge leue, sowle the befall Trust me, he wyll the neuer hele Thy bestes, thy goodes, and thy chyldren all Be deed and brent, nowe euery dele And thou lyest here, with many a byle Pratynge and prayenge, to the dyuyne And worse thou, stynkest, then a deed swyne. Lykewyse the wyfe, of olde Thoby Whose name as I remembre, was Anne Whiche hym entreated, boysterously With sad rebukes, nowe and than Called hym dryuell, and wytles fande Bycause he gaue, with herte so liberall Parte of hys goodes, to the porall. The wanton wyfe, of kyng Pharao Ioseph abhorred, with her to lye In place secrete, betwene them two God forbyd madame, sayde he Because she sawe, it wolde not be A shamefull lye, she dyd inuent In pryson to caste, that innocent. In women al thys propertye Is knowen sure, and manifeste That yf a man, maye come so nye To shewe them game, that they loue beste And wyll, not do it, then wyll they Ieste But truste me sure, that wyth the harte They wyll neuer loue him afterwarte. The wyse man sayth, in hys prouerbes A strumpettes lyppes, are dulce as honnye But in her dealynge, she is sowre as herbes worme wode, or rewe, or worse sayth he For when them lyketh, to mocke with the With tonge &amp; iye, such semblaunce they showe That harde it were, them to mystrowe. As though they spake, with mouth &amp; herte with face they make, so good semblaunce That harde it were, a man to starte From theyr fayre, glosynge countenaunce Thus with theyr sugered, vtteraunce The symple men, that meane but iuste Disceyued are, where they moste truste. In case they do you, but one benefyte An hondreth tymes, be you recompensed They wyll you euer, with that one entwyte Wyth lytell cause, or none offensed All our demerytes, shall be vnrecompensed So be it lesse, or be it more All is loste, ye gaue them before. If ye renounce, your copy holde And wolde be tenaunte, by Indenture There is no ware, then to be solde Ye muste go seke, at your aduenture For as of you, they haue no denture Thynke that I, wyll be so redy Naye by Iesse, I holde you a peny. And then yf ye, no labour make Ye maye be sure, that then wyll she The sure out throwe, the hawke to take Be lyke of her offynyte Good god howe straunge, nowe a dayes be ye I wolde haue thought, ye had ben none suche But by the lyttell, is knowen the moche So at lenght, by howche or by crouche Lesse or more, euer they craue Untyll thy hande, be in thy powche No wordes preuaylen, the to saue A thousande thousande, wayen they haue To make a man, a threde bare cote And leue hym neyther peny ne grote. Nowe thys nowe that they craue alwaye One thynge or other, they neuer rest Say what ye wyll, they will no naye Nor none excuse, but theyr owne request So they may be trimmed, and fed of the best They haue no remorse, who bereth the name Nor whome they put to open shame. The treueth is knowen, as in this case By holy wryte, autentycate Betwene Thamer, and the iudge Iudas The boke called Genesis, examinate Howe Thamer, the wydowe in the way sate Dysgysed her selfe, in straunge araye Iudas to dysceyue, after that waye. Her fresshe atyre, &amp; countenaunce therto Prouoked thys man, a questyon to make She lyghtlye consentynge, as some other do Sayd what will ye gyue, thy plesure to take Some pledge she sayde, for promyse is stake Of hym she requyred, staffe, mantell, and rynge Hys minde to folowe; and do the thynge. Shorte tale to make, the lawe was their owen A woman that founde was, in adultraytion Dewe profe alledged, by credyble men Shulde suffer death, saunce redempcion. The matter appered, by her bely She openly sayde, in slaunder of Iudas who oweth these thre, thys dede done has. Thus be they all, past shame and drede And careth not, who byd them bayle With gostly sentence, them to fede Lyttell or nothynge, doth them preuayle Be thy backe tourned, anone they rayle And saye for al your counsayle good Ye had leuer a bare ars, then a furred hood. To saye that they, can counsayle kepe It were to me, a maruaylous thynge Oneles it be, when they do slepe Or no body, to gyue the herynge Desyrous euer, of newe tydinge And were it matter, of lymme and lyfe Out it shall, be tolde belyue. Tully the Roman, vpon a daye Thought to approue, hys wyfe secrye In counsayle tolde her, he had put awaye The Emperour sonne, to the ende that we May raygne and rule, both lande and see Glad was she, and yet she went And hym dysclosed, incontinent. Tullye eschaped, harde with the lyfe And al by meane, of hys one folye Had not the trewth, be knowen belyue To haue be hanged, it was ieopardye Be it therfore, trewe tale or lye Be wyse and ware, wake ye or wynke And tell not your wyfe, al that ye tynke. Kynge Salomon both wytty and wyse A woman doth, Assymilate Unto a droppinge, euesynge guyse Dystyllyng downe, after rayne late Who droppes vnclene, doth maculate The fynest vesture, that any man weres wyth colde and wete, the body deres. Euen so a woman, lytygyous Dysquyeteth, a hole house holde And who so he be, that in his house Entendeth to kepe, a woman skolde The wynde that bloweth, both moyst &amp; colde Where better farre, for to herboure And lesse shulde fynde, of displeasure. Enuyous they be, it is dayly sene And prode also, of comparyson Recorde of Saba, the gorgyous quene Before, nor synce, was neuer suche a one Because she enuyed kyng Salomon To proue hys wysdome, &amp; take with a tryppe Passed the sees, in a marualous shyppe. Bycause that Naboth, wolde not sell Unto the kynge of Samarye The vyneyarde he had, at Israel Achab the kynge, became angrye As soone as Iesabell, the quene knewe why She strayly c?ma?ded, by wrytyng to fayne Some cryme vp? Naboth, &amp; so was he slaine. Loke and rede, the boke Bockas And ye shall fynde, many a reason The pryde of women, to defare For theyr mislyuyng, in theyr season Good women he wrote, were very geson As ye shal fynde, of nyntyne he wrote But of the twentye, neyther litter nor iotte. Salomon sayth, thre thynges there be Seldom, or neuer saturate. Hell the fyrste is of the thre The seconde a womans water gate The grounde of water, insacyate Of euery lewde fasshyon, reken who can And euer I warrante, the woman is one. Harde to be knowen, lyke m?bre therbi The fourth to knowe, who is he con The fyrste whych waye, a byrde wyll fle Or of a serpent, sprent from a stone What hauen a shyppe, shal be dryue vpon The craft of a hore, perceyue who con And euer I wyrrant, the woman is one. The grounde also, doth vary by thre The fourth may not, be stablyshed sure A bonde man set, in maiestye A foole fed fatte, whyles he will in powre An odyous woman, in weddynges vre An heyre made, of a bonde woman So euer I warrant, the woman is one. Whych thyngs rem?bred, well nere eche man Reporte of them, accordinglye And saye playnelye, that in the woman Is lyttell thynge, of prayse worthye Lettred or vnlerned, whyther they be They say of all creatures, women are the best. Cuius contrarium, verum est. And were not two small veneales The femynyne, myght be gloryfyde Set in thronys, perpetualles And as the gooddes, he deyfyde Two venyall synnes, they haue and hyde None of the seuen, theyr names who can tell The can neyther do, nor saye well. So to conclude, of hys treatyse A fynall ende, rude thought it be The processe throughe, who wyll superuise Shall well perceyue, I make no lye And ende therfore, to make shortlye In my conceyte, he lyueth in rest That medleth wyth them, of all people lest. Finis. Go forth lytell booke, be not a frayde To be accept, wyth them that are wyse And shewe them playne, what so be sayde In any parte, of thys treatyse Doth not dysdayne, theyr honestyse But for the lewde, might haue a myrrour, Here by to amende, theyr damnable errour. Lyke as the preacher, doth dyscomende All vyces lyuynge, with mouth and wyll Or as the mynstrell, doth entende wyth helpe of Lute, fynger or quyll Examply shewynge, to conuerte the yll Lyke so myne auctour, doth the same No creature lyuynge, spoken by name. Percase any one, dyspleasure take Bycause it toucheth her, properlye In case that she, suche wayes forsake whych moste accordeth, to her propertye She nedeth not herewyth to be angry God graunt vs all, we may do thys Euery man to amende one, in that is amys. The good alwayes, wyl be content with that, that is spoken, in generall There wil none so soone, be dyscontent As they that fretesed, be with all Rub a scalde horse, vpon the gall And he wyll byte, wynse and went So wyll al people that are maleuolent. Go forth therfore, amonge the thycke And bere in mynde, who is with the The wordes that Salomon, and Dauid spake In Iudicum, and in Genesye Hyerome, Iuuenall, and olde Tobye Caton, and Ouid, wyll testyfye And mercyall also, who listeth to trye. And vnto them, that lerned be I wolde and wyll, thou mekely went And shewe them, who so made the No thynge purposed, of yll intent That shulde prohybe the sacrament But that the masculyne, might hereby Haue somme what to reste, with the femyny.
