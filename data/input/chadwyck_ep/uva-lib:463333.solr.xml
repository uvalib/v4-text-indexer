      <field name="fulltext">P. K. In commendation of this worke. If Poets pens deserued prayse, Whose paynes deserued well: Much more the mindes, the pens, the men, Indued with heauenly skill. Of loue, of warre, of Plants, of Birds, Of Sheepe and Shepheards toyes: Haue Poets writ who lie in dust, Bereft of heauenly ioyes. Yet these we see through worlde their prayse, With eccho doth resound: Much more is prayse to Cotton due, Who makes Gods worde his ground. G. W. in prayse of this Booke. Will men be taught, in whom to put their trust, In time of troubles stird by tyrants pride: Or will they learne to whom the godly must Sing thankfull Himnes, when happie dayes betide? Lo heere a Lantarne, that may giue them light, Both to relie, and to reioyce a right. A. W. in commendations of this discourse. Let worldly wisedome stande a part, let policie giue place: To simple ones, to little babes, whose hartes are filde with grace. Whose tongues declare his prayse, to whom all prayse belonges. With ioyfulnes, with singing cheere, in Psalmes and spirituall Songs. And you that hitherto haue hid, your Talents in the ground: Come learne of him that hath but one, Gods mercies to resound. R. I. in commendation of this worke. You idle Drones, that fleece and cannot feede, You speechles ones, that can not barke nor bay: You Slowwoormes mates, that make so euill speede, To spie the Foxe, and driue the Wolfe away, This Booke shall be your iudge an other day. Which sweetely doth recorde: The mercies of our Lord. And liuely paints the whoredome of that Beast, Whose marke Gods Saints do faythfully detest. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A Spirituall Song: conteining an Historicall Discourse from the Infancie of the world, untill this present time Let them which han? beene redeemed of the Lord, shew how he hath deliuered them from the hande of the oppressor. Psal. 107. 2. Now may we all of England say of truth: Psal. 124. Psal. 48. 8 Psa. 121. to the end &amp; 125. 2. Psa 37. 33 As we haue heard, so haue we seene performd In these our dayes most worthy to be learnd: How that the Lord doth stil his Church defend From cruell foes, whom his to hurt pretend. Let vs therefore vnto our mindes now call, Psal. 37. 1 14. 32. The cruell rage that wicked men haue had, Agaynst the Lordes, as though they had been mad: Them to deuoure as Lions spoyle their pray, Inuenting their oppression day by day. As bloodie Caine, the first of Serpentes race, Gen. 4. 1. 1 18. &amp; 1. Iohn. 3. 12 &amp; Iude. 11 That onset gaue against the womans seede, For whose good workes he wrought that wicked deed. And as began, the combate still doth hold, That sonnes of lyfe, euen swallow quicke they would. As Lamech next, a bud of that vile roote, Gene. 4. 23 24. Who in his rage, all men would wound and kill, As though he did the law of God fulfill: Whose deedes to grace he coulde a Scripture cite, Although true sence and meanyng wrested quite. Gen. 9. 22. 25. 26. 17.Next him that Cham the sonne of Noe the iust, who soone reuiues the wounded seede of Cain, and doth as ill vncoueryng Fathers shame: and so procures a curse most vehemently, Vpon himselfe and his posteritie. Gen. 10. 8. 9. 10. &amp; 11. 3. to the ende.As he for one, that Nimrod hunter great, who sayd, Come buyld a Tower fayre and hie, a stately one, whose top may reach the skie: that we may get vnto our selues a name, and all may see we well deserue the same. Gen. 11.But this their rage the Lord did soone espie, and downe he came their language to confound, that one knew not what others did propound: and Citie theirs he called Babylon, which name doth shew, They found Confusion. Gen. 21. 9. 10. 11. &amp; Gala. 4. 22. to ende.And Ismael next, Ægiptian Hagars sonne, who Isaac skoft, of Abram blessed seede, so as it shewes how Cham doth still proceede, to hate, as Cain, the brother working good, Gen. 15. 13.foure hundred yeeres afflicting Isaacs blood. Gen. 27. 41 &amp; 32. 6. &amp; Ebre. 12. 16.The lyke doth he, that Esau most prophane, good Iaacobs blood vnkindly seeke to spill, like rauenyng Wolfe, which seely Lambe doth kill: and birthright solde for messe of pottage red, Iohn. 1. 29. &amp; 1. Cori. 10. 4. &amp; Iob. 6. 47.despising Christ, the Lambe, the Rocke, the Bread. Chams race holdes on, as Pharaoh hard of hart, Exod. 1. 9. 10. 11. 16. &amp; 5. 4. to 10. good Abrams seede most hardly to intreat, with slauish toyle, and burthens ouer great: in bricke and clay, and bondage very ill, vntill at length their children he did kill. From y? tyme that Ismael began, to the comming out of Egypt, which was 400. yeares.And thus they were foure hundred yeeres too long, Exo. 7. 19. &amp; 8. 6. 16. 24 &amp; 9 3. 10. 23. &amp; 10. 14 22. &amp; 12. 29. afflicted sore by Chams Ægyptian dogs: but they were plagu'd with lice, with flies, with frogs, with blood for blood, with blaines, with scabs with haile, to shew how smal man can gainst God preuaile. Himselfe, his host, his chariots and his horse, Exod. 14. 1. to ende. inclosd with waues, were tombd in heapes of sand, where Israel past from yoke of Egypt land: their ryder fell, and Israel skapt away, Exod. 15. 28. 21 and Miriam sung such prayse, as now we may. The seconde part. Then Amalec, of nations who was first, Num. 14. 45. &amp; 24. 20. that warre did make, Gods people to withstand, whereby they might them keepe from holy land: But Moses prayd whyle Sunne abode in skye, Exod. 17. 8. to the ende. and Iosua fought vntill his foes did flye. And God a curse vpon that nation gaue, Exo. 17. 14 &amp; Num. 24. 20. and vow did make their name for to roote out, because gainst his they shewd themselues so stout: 1. Sam. 15. 2. 3 and in Record he caused it to be, that he would warre with them continually. Exo. 17. 14. 16. Num. 22. &amp; 23. and 24. chapters. Num. 23. 7. Num. 22. 3. 5 Num. 13. 32.Then Balak he to Balam sayd, Come curse, come curse Israel, detest him I thee pray, who frets my hart to see him beare such sway: Then Balam sayd, a people blest of God, fayne would I curse, but that I feare his rod. 2. Pet. 2. 15. 16 &amp; Iude.11.Yet greedy gayne this Prophet false drew on, who wages lou'd vnrighteously to get, although dum Asse gainst that would teach him wit: Num. 22. 23. Num. 31. 8.And Angels sworde against him was out drawne, who spared then, yet in the ende was slayne. Iudg. 3. 8. 12. &amp; 4. 2. &amp;. 6. 1 &amp; 10. 7. 8. &amp; 13. 1.When Iudges ruld, sixe times full sore opprest were Gods elect, by Nations strong and stoute, some left in land, some others thereabout: Aram, Moab, Canaan, and such lyke, Madian, Ammon, Philistins, all did strike. Iudg. 3. 9. 10. Iudg. 3. 31. Iud. 3. 15. 17. 21. 22.But Othinel, Ehud, Shamgar, euen he, with goad of Oxe sixe hundred men did kill, and Ehud lame, fat Eglons blood did spill: These Iudges three, their foes (so strong) did bend, Iudg. 4. 16.and Barac did from Chariot wheeles defend. Iudg. 7. 20. &amp; 6. 12. Iud. 7. 16. 21. Iud. 7. 12. Iud. 11 33. Iudg. 15. 15.God whet his sworde, and valiant Gedion fought, with pitcher, pots, and men but hundreds three, yet foylde that host which numbred could not bee: Of Ammon townes did Ieptath twenty strike, and with Asse iaw did Samson thousand smite. And Deborah holpe, and Starres &amp; Streames did striue, Iudg. 4. 9. Iud. 5. 21. gaynst Canan Kinges, at ancient Kishon brooke, at Kishon streames God on his Saints did looke: And Iaels hand with Hammer smote the Nayle, Iud. 4. 21. 22. 23. 24. &amp;. 5. 24. to 28. whereby Israel gaynst Sisera did preuayle. Yet did these streames increase their strength agayne, and others met, vntill great floods they were, in Dauids time, as it may well appeare: Both forraine foes, and those at home in brest, 1. Sam. 26. 18 to 21. and 2. Sam. 15. as Absalon and Saul, aboue the rest. Who Dauid sought, as one would do a Flea, 1. Sam. 26. 20 and still did hunt th'Annoynted of the Lord, his soule to take as Hunter Partridge would: 1. Sam. 24. 12 &amp; 26. 20. Euen so did he most cruelly persist, to persecute in him both God and Christ. Yet did he stand as Lyon strong and stout, Accordyng to Gen. 49. 8. to 13. vntill he did his foes all subiect bring, and he through God, did raigne alone as King: For whom the Lord the Crowne and Diademe kept, aye to remayne: but Sauls away he swept. 1. Sam. 15. 28 The thirde part. Agayne in dayes of King Iehosaphat, 2. Croni. 20. 1 the ende. &amp; Psal. 83. 1. to the ende. the vile pretence of wicked men we see, and forces great, like Mountains seemd to bee: That then had ioynd in league and constant band, to cut off quite poore Israel from their land. Psal. 83. 4. Psal. 83. 3. 4.And that no name of Nation they should haue, as then those craftie councels had decreed, but thought in hart to cut them off with speed: Psa. 83. 6. to .9and were in band ten Nations well we know, that then had ioynd to serue good Israel so. 2. Chro. 20. 6. to 14. &amp; Psal 83. 9. to ende. 2. Chro. 20. 22 2. Chro. 20. 17 2. Chro. 20. 25But Israel prayd, and God for them did fight, to him they cald, and he their sute did heare, and causd their foes kill each with others speare: they standing still, saluation did behold, and three dayes were in gathering of their gold. 2.
