      <field name="fulltext">X. MOONLIGHT ON LOCH KATRINE. Ah me! 'tis sweet on such a night as this To watch the soft beams faintly lingering yet On distant hill tops, when the sun hath set; 'Tis sweet to watch the scarce-felt breezes kiss The waveless surface of the unsleeping lake, Whose soft unrest strange varying forms doth take. But O 'tis sweeter at such witching hour To mark the fitful moon-beams' mirrored glow Shimmering like starlights on the depth below, Or poured from heaven in one broad silvery shower, Now one, now many, as the shifting rays Weave o'er the tide their undulating maze. There is a glory words may not express In that bright sparkling track of mutable loveliness. Aug. 1851. XIX. FAREWELL TO GRASMERE. Full many a sad and bitter word There is to hear and tell, But the saddest and the bitterest Is still to say, Farewell! Full many a soft and dimpled lake Laughs in the sun's bright eye, By Alpine height, by Cambrian wild, 'Neath Caledonia's sky. But O, had I a home to choose, Far rather would I dwell By the streamlets and the peat-stained rocks Of Loughrigg's breezy fell. The mountains gleam entablatured On waveless Grasmere sleeping, And the rain-washed bushes round the marge, Like dark-robed nuns are weeping. The shadows, O how silently O'er Dumail Race they glide, And Helm Crag rears his mist-wreathed head Like a lion in his pride. The Rothay steals, how noiselessly, Beneath that bridgeway shade, Where the relics of the mountain bard In holy ground are laid Wordsworth, buried in Grasmere churchyard. Sept. 1850.. Oh, might the too presumptuous thought A moment be forgiven, Sure, such a dream of loveliness Our fancy pictures heaven. Farewell, farewell, O I could weep To leave thy fern-clad hills, And to miss the sweet vibration of The music of thy rills. Farewell, farewell, the saddest word, But yet it must be spoken, Though daily at that farewell word The hearts of men are broken. XXXI. JESUS OUR LIFE. Hail, Jesus, hail, my dearest Lord, Thy wounds how bright they shine! The Father's consubstantial Word, Thy flesh is one with mine. True God with the blest three Thou art, Saint Mary's true-born Son, A person by Thyself apart, With theirs Thine Essence one. Hail to Thy sacred nature shared With Sire and Spirit blest! Hail to the tender love declared In Thy dear human breast! Hail, the uncreated Majesty Of Spirit, Sire, and Son, Hail to the undivided Three, Hail to the Trinal One! XXXIX. FAREWELL TO NORTH WALES. Farewell, 'tis a stranger his blessing bequeaths, Refuse not the offering he tremblingly brings, For the harp of the North no fond patriot wreathes, And chill is the hand that swept o'er its wild strings. Thy minstrels no more sing of saintly Gwydellyn, And how brave Arthur routed the infidel Dane, Yet fancy shall dwell on the feats of Llewellyn, And dirge-like re-echo their once potent strain. Farewell to the tints of thy shadow-stained mountains, Farewell to the mist-wreaths that hang on their brow, Farewell to the voice of thy clear sparkling fountains, That merrily gush to the valleys below. Oh, often in day-dreams of youthful emotion The heart shall revisit thy wood-skirted lakes, Though bright be the smile of the summer-lit ocean, A brighter on them the soft mountain-breeze wakes. O fair are the sunbeams aerially blending On Snowdon in veins of green varying light, And, if from the scraggy steeps clouds are descending, Are not earth's brightest joys evershrouded in night? Farewell, O farewell, still thy requiem prolonging, Half-lingering I pause o'er the beautiful theme, While phantom-like memories round me are thronging, The troubled return of an exquisite dream. XL. DUNGEON GHYLL FORCE. A mountain cleft unformed by mortal hand, Whereout the pent-up stream in dizzy leap Springs down a sunless cavern, dark and deep, With drizzling cliffs precipitously grand Hemmed inâa dungeon not unmeetly named, Whose peat-stained walls dank shrubs are bending o'er, And shut the blue sky out, as though they claimed Some tribute from the spray's up-darting shower; And, like a chancel-arch of rude carved stone, Across the chasm a self-formed arch is thrown, Of old, it may be, by some earthquake's shock, Hewn from the living masses of the rock. Beneath, amid the waterfall's deep knelling, From out a quiet pool a brook is ever welling. XLI. LOOKING FROM THE TOP OF HELVELLYN. O'er Fairfield head the mist-wreaths swift did glide, And drifting clouds on Esthwaite valley closed, The while, behind us, on Helvellyn's side The sunlights, oh how gloriously, reposed. Where no stray influence of those gleams could light, In sable robes magnificently drest, Scawfell upreared aloft her giant crest Against the sky in outline definite; The breeze that swept o'er Redtarn from the hill Just curled the surface; all below was stillâ Of tranquil souls a blessed type to me, On God's sure mercies staid, which the wild war Of earthly passion stirs, but cannot mar Their inward life of deep serenity. XLII. THE HEIGHTS ABOVE DUNGEON GHYLL FORCE. I climbed unto a summit lone, With waters round me flowing, When the blaze of the unclouded noon On Loughrigg tarn was glowing; And Bowfell, like a maiden coy, Shrouded in clouds her brow, But unblamed the sunbeams showered joy Upon the vale below. In sooth it was a beauteous sight, Of all unearthly glory, Such as in childhood we delight To paint in faÃ«ry story; Though words all impotent I deem That beauty to declare, Imaginations wildest dream No vision half so fair. But would'st thou go to Loughrigg, go At evening's witching hour, When sunset-lights their radiance throw On copsewood, heath, and bower; Where imbedded in their calm retreat The cottage windows gleam, And thy gentle waters, Rothay, greet Thy brother's wider stream. Then all silent is the fern-clad moor, No human sound is near, Save when some solitary oar Is heard on Windermere. Oh then, dear Loughrigg, on the heart May thy kind influence fall, Nerving it still to bear its part In life's stern ordeal. XLIII. THOUGHTS SUGGESTED BY A MIST ON SKIDDAW. O'er Derwentwater in the vale The mid-day sun rode high, And yellow waving corn-fields smiled Beneath a cloudless sky. But when we stood on Skiddaw's brow, Dim mists obscured the view, They hid the earth's unsullied green, The heavens' o'erarching blue. We knew that all before us spread The sun-bright valley lay, And lakes, like sheets of molten gold, Dipped in that living ray. We knew it all, and longed to gaze, If for one moment's space, But cloud on cloud kept hurrying on In long unbroken race. Yet lower on the mountain's side, Through the half-lifted screen, Glad meadows, and the silvery sea, In unveiled light were seen. Young Christian, scorn thou not the tale It shadows forth to thee, Encircling this our outward life, A life of mystery. From us a glorious world unseen Sin's lurid vapours hide; Blest angels, ah! how thanklessly, Around our footsteps glide. A heavenly vision lies outspread Before our dreaming eyes, But we are all too dull to see Its bright realities. Yet faint thou not, though dark and dim The path of holiness, Each step leads on to brighter day, Those shadows still grow less. And some there are of higher grace, To whom it hath been given Dread glimpses through the clouds to see, Reflected lights of heaven. Yet, though thy view as theirs be clear, Thou seest but in part; A cloud is on the mountain-brow, A veil is on thy heart. Pray we of Christ the power to meet With calm untroubled gaze The lightning-like apocalypse Of that cherubic blaze. What time heaven's dread consistory Bursts on our waking sight, And earth, in all her nothingness, Sinks into endless night. XLIV. THE TWO RIVERS. Full many a minstrel-harp can tell The rugged glens of Wales, I do not love them half so well As England's laughing vales: Through lonely moor and copsewood brake Full many a stream is flowing, Full many a tarn, and sunbright lake In the far North is glowing; Yet none of all, whose sparkling fountains Ring merrily amid those mountains To me is half so dear, As those whose newly-mingled stream, Like some bright unremembered dream, Is lost in Windermere. Dear Rothay, wilt thou not disdain The homage of a simple strain On all-discordant things? O worthy thou of higher praise, Forgive my feeble earthbound lays And false imaginings. A bolder hand, with touch of fire, Hath tuned for thee a truer lyre, A nobler heart hath loved thee; O for a breath of music brought From him, to aid my wavering thought, Whose burning words approved thee! I've watched thee where thy waters sped Glancing through their narrow bed, What time the varying shadows fell From Loughrigg on the breezy dell, And gleams besprent of gold and green, Scarce piercing though the leafy screen, Played o'er thy dark unsunny places, Like smiles in sleep on infant faces, Striving, 'twould seem, with gentle wile That sullen darkness to beguile. I've watched thee when the moon's pale beam Shone coldly on thy silent stream, Where its chill-flowing eddies sweep Beneath the bridgeway dark and deep; A voice they seemed to have for me, And I longed to thread the mystery. Sweet minstrel of the echoing glen, Though ever dear, yet dearest then, When night her sable mantle flings O'er thy unaudienced murmurings. For gentle thoughts may best arise When the moon is in the sky, To disentrance the sympathies Of sainted memory. 'Twas then thy accents spake most clear, 'Twas then his spirit seemed most near Whose vows are in thy keeping; And mingled thoughts of joy and pain Came o'er my soul like summer rain And filled my eyes with weeping. O be those accents with me ever, An echo still unbroken, Still dwell with me, thou far-off river, Still speak as thou hast spoken. Nor be that elder stream unsung Whose waters their wild descant rung, With foam-bells glancing bright, Where on the peat-stained rock I stood And gazed upon the heaving flood Poured down its dizzy height. Yet deem not Brathay's foaming course Can never lull its torrent force; It hath mild graces too; When fiercest passions rock the mind, They leave a hidden store behind Of musings good and true. Smoothest its waters seem to glide Where flickers mirrored on the tide That little chapel cross; Where gurgling by each polished stone It utters forth a chaunt-like moan For one who loved to sit thereon The late Rev. T. Whitehead., Wreathing the dewy moss; Yea, thou didst fling thine artless strain O'er it, and ne'er shalt fling again, Therefore its quiet pools beneath Are types to me of good men's death. On the shore of the far southern seas An outcast thou art lying, Where the whispers of the island breeze Are ever, ever sighing; They thought the altar-stone should be The altar of the College chapel (in New Zealand) was to have been over his tomb, but the site of the building was obliged to be changed. Above where thou art laid, That still the blessed Liturgy Might over thee be said; But all weak are human counsels And human forethought vain, If the Almighty Ruler wills Its purpose to restrain. Yet though no stately choir enclose The holy place where thy limbs repose, Nor at thy tomb in minster tall Is sung the potent ritual, Thou canst not lack the Church's prayer, Thou still art 'neath her sheltering care, Who for her children solace hath Even in the dreary grave; Though, for the anthem's wafted breath, Loud ocean-billows rave; And One, whose word can ne'er deceive Hath sworn His own He will not leave, Omnipotent to save. O surely I should do you wrong, Dear brother streams, in this my song, If hymning each, I poured no greeting To celebrate your tuneful meeting,â Sweet emblem of two kindred hearts That into one are moulded, Like harmony's mysterious parts All mutually enfolded. Even with such loving, virgin grace Your waters meet in soft embrace With Loughrigg o'er them bending; And, if their onward course be brief, Who would recall his earthly grief, When life's long march is ending? Though tasteless prove each fleeting joy, True love alone shall never cloy; And if our friendships here be pure What though by death their bands are riven? 'Tis but a moment;âthey endure Through all eternity in heaven. XLV. YORK MINSTER AT NIGHT. Hushed was the city, and with hollow beat Sounded each footfall through the lonely street, No earth-lit torch, no lamp with ruddy glare Marred the soft shower of silvery moonbeams there;â As glories circle pictured saints they shone, A light o'er all that many-steepled town; Yet purest ever, brightest seemed to fall, Illuming the fair Minster's southern wall. Through the rich window's full-orbed pane they pour Their tinted radiance on the transept floor; Gleams half unveiled before the astonished eye Carved niche and foliated tracery, Each fretted pinnacle, each mullion grey Glows in the snow-white brilliance of that ray. Pause we a moment at the western porch, Beneath the shadow of that mighty Church. O how magnificent its structures rise, A silent, interceding sacrifice! One guardian tower reared o'er each solemn aisle, A threefold band they crown the reverend pile, Darkly revealed against the moonlit sky, Meet emblem of the awful Trinity. But hark! with thrilling cadence still and deep, Flung o'er the city drowned in careless sleep, Tolls forth the summons of the midnight hour, Waking the echoes of yon southern tower. In vain, alas! in vain those heavenly tones,â Midnight hath here no midnight orisons! No more in accents of seraphic fire Rings the blest ritual through the tapered choir, Whose far-off music in the stilly night, Charming from thought unblest each wandering sprite, Might haply blend, like Fancy's pensive gleams, With some young sleeper's solitary dreams;â 'Tis so no more; unsung the midnight mass, Or feast or fast alike unheeded pass By those who sleep their vigil nights away, Nor fear the breaking of the judgment-day. âPeace, murmurer,â (thus with sweetly stern controul Some angel-voice might lull the troubled soul,) âPeace, thankless dreamer; say, art thou so pure, Canst thou alone not patiently endure To lean undoubting on thy mother's breast, Where holiest, saintliest sons have sunk to rest? For her could martyred Charles a crown forego, Laud on the scaffold bend his mitred brow, And still it burns unquenched, the martyrs' zeal,â The full seven thousand at her altars kneel;â Yea, rather, when the flood of sacred song Rolls in full tide yon echoing aisles along, In meekness kneel, for thine own errors grieve, Unmeet the smallest blessing to receive, Learn that e'en here no niggard boon is given, More than enough to guide thy steps to heaven.â Aug. 31, 1847. XLVI. TO MY LITTLE BROTHER ON HIS FOURTH BIRTHDAY, Sept. 30, 1847. O I love to gaze on thy face so fair, And the sunny locks of thy flowing hair, And to read the joyous spell that lies In the flashing glance of those dark bright eyes. 'Tis true, that young and lovely face, It smiles with all but angel's grace; O may it smile for evermore Where angels tread the eternal shore! But thou art wayward, wild, and young; Thy faith is weak, and the world is strong; O ne'er may her fond wiles have power To lure thee in temptation's hour! O by that sign the devils know, Traced on thy once guileless brow, O by my love, my prayers, my tears, Fond hopes and agonizing fears, Let no earth-stain of sin defile The freshness of thine infant smile; Still on thy brow the cross be bright, Unmarred thy chrisom's spotless white. Bright be thy boyhood, blest thy youth, Nursed in the ways of holiest truth, Thine be the draught of innocent joy, The purer, sure, the last to cloy. Dearest! though threatening skies may lower, Though tear-bedimmed each fairest flower, Though blighted every joy of earth, Though hushed each sound of ruder mirth, Yet One, thou knowest, is ever near, His thought thy saddest hour may cheer, His smile the darkest clouds illume, His love dispel grief's sullen gloom. And oh, if aught avail above The vows of pure fraternal love, Ne'er will I cease on bended knee To pour a deep heart-prayer for thee. XLIX. CONSECRATION OF COLOGNE CATHEDRAL. It is a blessed festival, A day of solemn gladness; Then wherefore droop our faithless hearts With unaccustomed sadness? High o'er angelic choirs this day The Mother-Maid was throned;â Where are the flowers to deck her shrine? The voice her praise to sound? In vain for us the festal chimes In old Cologne are ringing, In vain the Church beyond the seas Her festal mass is singing. At all her countless altars No place, no home have we; And all the bells of Christendom âThey peal a fast for me!â Yet there is consolation Even in that thought of sorrow, The past may give an augury Of promise for the morrow. Full plaintive was the melody Of Zion's captive daughters, What time their harps were hung beside The Babylonian waters. Long time the virgin-seer beloved, On Chebar's dreary plains, Wept o'er his country's widowed state, Her desecrated fanes. Full many a sunbright holyday Glared on his aching eyes, Full oft at close of Sabbath eve Would tears unbidden rise. Dim though the priestly cuirass gleam, Prophetic now no more, Though on the mercy-seat there stream No radiance, as before; E'en yet towards Jerusalem His keen regards are bent, Oft as each hour of prayer recalls The grief of banishment. Nor unaccepted, sure, above Those orisons arise, Though with his vesper prayer may blend No vesper sacrifice. Is not the unoffered sacrifice By heavenly grace supplied? Nor to that saintly outcast, deem Is Heaven's free peace derived. Still meekly, with unswerving faith, The appointed time he waits, Content in solitude to bide Without the temple gates. What if for our unworthiness Such cross on us be laid? Bitter was his obedience, But was it not o'erpaid? O mark him well, ye murmurers, Nor leave the appointed road; What though the cross press heavily, It is the will of God.</field>
