      <field name="fulltext">THE SPIDER and the Flie. The preface. A Parable: is properlie one thing, That of an other doth conceiuing bring. Yea: (oftentims (as parables are scand, One score of things: by one, be vnderstand. Eche one of all: scanned and vsed well, Maie teache the scanner good: to take &amp; tel. Contrarilie: scanned and vsed ill, Like il likewise, the fruite a mounteth vntill. Wherfore, before entrance to scanning here: In present parable here to appere, First to induct (for to conduct) the waie: How readers and scanners: redilie maie: Right scanning (in right reading) here purchase, Good readers: reade and scan (rightlie) this case. There chaunst at once: at one fayre glasse to bee, Them selues tatire at once, fayre women three. Where one an other enuide: till all were drest, Who might (when all weare drest) seme dressed best. But in the time of trimming of their geare: There foreheads striking vp: broyding their heare: Lacing and laying it: with euerie thing: Lookte in the glasse: directing trim trimming, In all this time: these women euerychone, Behelde eche ether: but them selues not one: That in the glasse: vpon her selfe cast iye, Good or ill tiring (in her selfe) tespie. One heare ley low: one other lay to hie: On this side: or on that side: cleane awrie. But herevpon: when eche had other espide: In tire atired: all a wrie or wide, Lord in all three: what inward sport there was, Eche one to se an other, in that glas. All three sore sweld: but be it best or wurst: Twayne must vent vpward streight: or both must burst, While margret went a side: her pins to fet, Marian and margerie: back they both get. To touch thatire, of margaret thus worne. Betwene them twaine, to laugh that third to scorne. Marion saide to Margerie: se you not, How Meg is drest, yes Madge (quoth she) god wot. Might not a beetill blind beast: bring to passe: To dresse her selfe as well at any glasse, Yes madge: and with one Iie: I can now se: What spots (vnsene to her) in her face be. Ye Mall (quoth Madge) I thinke I should il hie me? To dresse my selfe so ill: the glasse so nie me, God hath done his part: she hath a good face, Which gift of God, her selfe doth ill disgrace, Marion at this: stepping fro margerie, Margret to Margerie: stepth by and bie. And streight of Marion: margret falth in hand; How fer from frame: Marions a tyre doth stand, Madge and Meg finding faute: at marion more, Then Madge and Marion: found at Meg before. The thirde corse was: that madge did start a side: Whearwith Marion to Meg: hastelie hide. And Margeries atyre: they set a broche, As yll (or woorse (the worse her to reproche,) Then she was tierde in deede. Thus all these three: Deuided thrise in twaine, did thrise agree: Eche twayne, the thirde to mocke and geste vpone: Tyll euerie one, had mocked euerichone. Eche mocking others faute: they fautie all, Eche mockers mocke, most on her selfe did fall. This done, one of these three to the glasse went: No face but hers, then being represent Where: when she did her selfe onlie behold, Her silent sight: her fore follie so told: That marking first her selfe, her selfe she a tierde, And then the rest, (in theyr atyre) desierde, That eche vpon her selfe: wolde set sure iye, Ere she cast iye on other, low or hie. They doing so: all weare atired so, That whether a part, or they together goe Had they bene willing: they had bene vnable, Sparke or spek to spie: discommendable: Ech in others atire. Which women and glasse, Are a glasse. this booke, and readers to compasse, In scanning sence to towch men in this booke: As glasse lookers lookte: if booke readers looke: He vpon him: and he on him: to scan: Sence most and best, naie most and worst thei can: Scanning who is the spider: who the flie: Neither of either: to him selfe taplie: Scanning no whit: by scanning here to se: In case spiders: in case flies: all scand maie be, Glasse looking: and booke reading: in such wise, May well be scand, one lyke vaine exersise. Who that this parable doth thus define, This parable thus, is his and not mine. To this, this one thing I must mind you to minde. Concerning spiders, flies, and eke thants kinde. Wheare I: their naturall operacion: With the largest enlarge: tenlarge foundacion: Wheron I frame this top storie: here to see, As both: both in length and breadth: maie most agree, This (for this cause) strecht the more long and wide, I praie you beare with me: wheare it is spide. Wherin: my faut maie seme sumwhat the lesse, That wiser men then I (in like processe,) Haue done the like and late: one wise and olde: In an old booke did reade (as he me told,) That when so euer spiders, flies, and ants speake, Their approprid properties, they likewise breake. Which if them selues do: ye will graunt I hope: That I (doing it for them) may haue like scope. Thus wishing wishinglie: in reading this, Readers: to reade and scan: all sentencis: As we first marke and mend our selues: and then, To marke: to mend: the fautes of other men: Without more scanning here: I now herein, End circumstaunce, the substaunce to begin. FINIS. The Introduction to the matter, showing howe the flie chaunsed to fall in the spiders copweb. Cap. prim?. In season what time euery growing thinge That ripeth by roote, hath liuely taken hart Grasse, leafe, and flowre, in field so florishing That wintered withered stalk?, stand in couart Though weerie wythered hart?, plaie than like part Couertly coucht in bed, them selues to hyde Yet hart? of lust, the bed can not abyde. But vp they must, profe of that lust to make In whiche like cherefull tyme, it chaunced me From sleepe one night, so timelie to awake That how ferre night, or how nie daie might be It past my reache, of searche, sure sine to se But streight, the searche of nature wrought the crowe Of daunyng of the daie, warnyng to showe. Upon whiche admonision I arose, But by the tyme, that I coulde get me out, The daie apeereth and so brode breaketh lose, Leadyng mine eye, at large to loke about The field?, so freshe, that be ye out of dout For sauour, sight, and heringe eche byrd? voyse No chaunge could chaunce, to choose the better choyse. Whiche I (reioysynglie) herde and behelde Tyll suche time as the sonne, was cum in sight, So that the dew (drawne by his powre) must yelde From therth to thaire, from whence it fell that night And hauyng herein had mine appetight I made returne (temprately to remayne) Out of whot sonne, to temprate house agayne. Where as (anone) a booke I tooke in hand Some thinge to reade, to fode foorth fantasie And stepping to a window, there to stand, In at a lattes hole, right sodenlie Euen at a fling, fast flew there in a flie That sang as shrill, and freshlie in my minde, As any byrde coulde do, bredde of that kinde. About the parler flew this flie full rounde, And as apeerde: he sought for foode in deede, But when in no wise, ought wolde there be founde, In to the buttrie (hastelie) he yeede And stale in to the almerie to feede, Where he (at pleasure) triumpht vncontrolde, Till he had there (at will) wrought what he wolde. From whense (anone) couragiouslie he flang Now here, now there, of winge he made no store, But for a flie oh lorde how he then sang Two notes aboue his highest note before, Wherin, encreast his courage more and more, He flew, he friskt, he tost, he turnde about, The flie of flies, no flie I trow so stout But as the firmament most cleere and blew The golden sonbeames bent to bewtifie The courtaine drawne of clowdie weeping hew Withdraweth and chaungeth, that christall asure skie From blew to blacke: so fareth it with the flie. Amyd whose ioy, at window to haue past, A copweb maskth his winges and maketh him fast. Thus chaunce hath (by exchaunge) the flie so trapt, That sodainly he lost his libertee: The more he wrange, the faster was he wrapt And all to thencrease of his ieoberdee, Which parell, when he did conceiue and see Suche was his rage in hast from thence to flitte As made him seeme, welnie out of his witte He wafted his winges, he wagged his tayle He shooke his head, he frounde, he stared wyde, He spurnde, he kickte, but when nought wolde auayle To ryd him thence, but there he must abyde, As breath and breast wolde beare, loudely he cryde And wofullie as any one flie can In folowynge foorme, this wofull flie began. The lamentacion of the flie, with declaracion (partlie) of the propertie of Fortune, and of his owne estate past and presente. Cap. 2 Alas, alas, alas and welawaie, To crie aloude alas, what cause haue I Alas (I saie) that euer I sawe this daie, My whole estate in twinklyng of an eye Is here transformde from myrth to miserie, For frowarde fortune hath led my mys hap To lay and locke me in myne ennemies lap. Oh sodayne sorowe, from setled solas, For so sat I in solas: as me thought. Oh fortune, false flaterer that euer was, In one moment, and in an other wrought So furious, that both thaffect? foorth brought, Furie, or flaterie, which is worst in thee Hard for a flie, to iudge the certeintee. Namelie for me, who all my life haue beene Lapped in lap of thy fayre flattering flowres, Till from those roses, now thou castest me cleene Into thease nettles, of thy furious showres, Wherin my lacke of practice, lacketh powres. (My whole tyme hauing bene spent in the tone) To iudge in thease two, whiche is the woorst one. I lacke (I meane) iudgement to iudge at full, Bothe thease sayde sides: Howbeit here to declare, Somwhat in bothe partes, I bothe can and wull Mine entrie now, in chaunge from ioye to care, Hath in this instant taught me to compare Flaterie with furie, trewth in both to trie, When Fortune telleth treuth: and when Fortune doth lie. Who while she was (or rather seemde) my freende, Thapparaunce of hir pleasaunt countenaunce Promised me, my welth shoulde haue none eende, But swifter then the star doth seeme to glaunce That assemblaunce: turneth to dissemblaunce, Myne ended welth, now turnde to endles wo, Amyd monge hir false flaterie, proueth so. And putting now hir fewrie here in vre Threatning the daunger of my life present, Perfourmaunce therof doth appere as sure As it in maner had experiment, Hir fewrie is a glasse right excellent Betwene fewrie and flaterie to deuise To take hir threats trew, and hir promesse liese Flaterie, and fewrie, thus in hir this gose, When she speaketh fayre, then hath she lust to lie. When she speaketh foule, then trewth she will disclose, Which thinge showth somwhat straunge, but commenlie In man to man, mans vse doth verifie, In loue, and hate, disclosyng trewth and liese The selfe show showde in dailie exercise. In sundrie thinges experience doth tell, No friende, with friende (in friendship) will be plaine, As foe, with foe, will in his fewrie fell. Loue, to tell trewth, doth ofte for loue refraine, Hate hideth no iote vntolde for to remaine. Loue, lockth in trewth, least trewth might friend? displease, Hate, lashth out trewth, foes to displease and disease. Friendes (in this case) will hide trewth, and show liese. Foes (in this case) will hide lies and shew trewth, Of trewth that towcheth in displeasant wise. Hate hideth nought, that memorie endewth In man, and fortune, who that fully vewth, How vse of trewth, and lies herein hath gone, Shall se in both, small difference saue this one. Loue causeth friendes to hide displeasant trowth, To kepe their friendes in quiet while thei maie. By loue in friendes to friendes, a lothnesse growth, In thing extreeme, the trewth extreeme to saie, Where hiding of the trewth, harmeth no waie Or that the trewth, is better hid then tolde There friende, to friende, by loue will trewth with holde. But those respectes, fortune doth nought attend, Hir hidden trewth, in pleasaunt present show, Is to begile, such as on hir depend, When from hir grace, their greefe vnknowen shall grow By fore purposed, folowing ouerthrow. In quiet calme, she shadoweth shipwracke rockes, To make hir mariners hir mockyng stockes. And noting here (from hir proclaimed calme) How sodenlie hir stolne stormes, do arise Of ioie longe sought, late had, the sodeine qualme I iudge to be hir great ioy, to deuise By hir which ioy: my sorow in this wise, Teacheth me (I say) to say that I haue saide, And so much more, as is next after laide. What is long liking life, the tyme once past, Except the same, haue bene orderlie spent Thaccounted audite daie, must cum at last, When woorde, and deede, with thought of eche entent, Shall haue a iust account, with like iudgement Wolde god for all whiche dredfull doubtfull doutes That I had died euen in my swadlynge cloutes. For liue we neuer so longe a time here, The tyme determined once that hence must wee, Then doth all worldelie pleasure past, apere Euen as in deede it is, all vanitee, Whiche pleasure hath bene longe possest in mee I thinke in no creature liuynge more That euer liued here, a flie before. Full many a night, haue I escaped harme, When many a flie, to harme was bought and solde And many a night haue I lien close and warme When many a flie abrode hath died for colde, And many a flie the flap hath iobde and iolde, When I haue safely kepte from ieobardee, My selfe, and all the flies, that folowde mee. Wherby (with flies) I was then so esteemed That few thinges passed without my councell And where I past: there was no daunger deemed Nor no cause why, for in all thinges that fell My woorke did then approue my wit so well That nowhit cared I, what flie did know it, Nor yet how far or brode al flies did blow it. I haue bene (ere this daie) these many daies. By mine experience and mother wit, Highly in estimacion many waies, And where I was present, no flie wolde sit, Nor pertely prease, to blow or bite one bit Till I were set, for where were fleshe or fishe, The choise of both was mine in euery dishe. And I suppose as longe as present tence, Maie keepe possest possession peasably, To stand in place and case of reuerence, Is thing much pleasaunt, to all flies welny, But once in chaunged case as now am I, The preter tence, presentlie takinge place, Then hath the present tence lost all his grace. Alas my ioyfull ioy of yesterdaie, How can it cure my carefull care present, Of pleasure past, remembraunce doth alwaie The pinche of present payne, right much augment. Then in this present case this consequent, Conclewdeth (I say) all pleasure past to bee Nought els, but vanished vaine vanitee. Thus lithe there now in charge of my repreefe, Those thinges, which I haue longe time gloried in. Which glory past, encreaseth present greefe, And as my woorthy wyt did woorship win, So shall shew of my foly, neuer blin To bruite defame, report of this distresse, Shall tosse and turne my wyt to foolyshnesse. As thus, the simplest flie whiche by my skoole, Is taught (ere this) of copwebs to beware, And seeth his master plaie so far the foole, To be my selfe now tript in the same snare, Shall by reporte my folie full declare, Whiche surely shall amonge all flies suruiue As long as any one flie is aliue. And though, this fall, I take to be as cleane Without my faute, as without remedie, And pacience the medsonable meane, To take all fautles falles, reioisinglie. And eke where no helpe, helpeth maladie, To make a vertue, of necessitee, Yet those two poinctes, are poynctes to high for me, For be I faultie, or be I faultles, Sins I, this dreadfull daunger must endure, I am not mortified to beare distres, And being cleere remediles from cure Of all my paines, that putteth most paine in vre, From step, to step, stretcht on this straining staier, No step like that, straineth daunger of dispaier. For where as if remedy, anie weare, Hope (out of hande) shoulde set me there about, As hope of helpe is drownde, so I for beare All diligens, that hence might helpe me out, Thus though the caged byrde (with stomake stout: And voise right sweete) can sing his song? by roate, Yet can the fettred flie, so: sing no noate, Example of my selfe, whose weeping eiese, With sobbing sighinge harte, bewaileth my payne, Appeering suche, by ought I can surmiese, As doth (in maner) show my death certaine, Namely if so the spider now remaine In this his manshion, set here presentlie, Then dred I doutles, here, foorthwith to die. Of such a death as most abhorth vs flies, Which, flies haue felt, and folke haue seene to plaine, Of propertie the spider hath the gise, First to sucke out, and so eate vp our braine, To his small gaine: and our most losse and paine, Thus hath it bene, thus is it, and thus shalbe, Till pittie may mitigate thextremite. The dreadfull wonder of the spider at sodaine shakyng of his copweb. Cap. 3. VVhat tyme the flie, this to him selfe had saide, About the house he cast a dolefull looke, Wherwith (to breake away) he made abraide, With such a thrust, that all the copweb shooke, At whiche the spider stert, and streight awooke Out of sounde sleepe, full fast trembling for feare, And feintlie spake (anone) as ye shall heare. Alas where am I: alas whence came I? Or whither shall I? what? this an erthe quake? Or cometh the daie of doome now sodeinly? Nought els (I trow) but that, my house coulde make In euery place to shatter and to shake, What is this buzzyng blumberinge trow we: thunder? Holde house, alas my seelyng riueth a sunder, No parte hath rest, in all partes of this frame, From roofe to groundsill, within any roome. Is it the diuell? or is it our dame? Or is it the page? or is it the groome? Or is it our maide with hir birchin broome? Betwene the diuel, and all these, last and furst, The diuel take me, if I can choose the wurst. But ill, woorse, and woorst, diuel, and all togither Do me assaute as it (to me) doth seeme, Hath fortune wrought my foes at this tyme hither, And not so much as warnde me to misdeeme, Now fie on fickle fortune thus extreeme, And I defie the garde of suche a guider, Alas (this day) I am but a dead spider. These woordes thus spoken, downe anone he sanke. Kneling a while, deuoutlie on his knee, And then rounde on a heape, to grounde he shranke Like an vrchyn vnder an aple tree. No felon, fast in fetters for his fee, Nor ape in chaine, that euer lookte more pale, Then lookte this spider, after this tolde tale. So that these twayne, stand now in one estate, For in like langour, both be now here led, And of their liues, both like desperate, For now the spider, is as far in dred, And by that dred he is euen as neere ded, As is the flie, who thinketh he seeth at eie, His death aproachyng him, aparantlie. The spider takyng comfort, entreth in quarell with the flie. Cap. 4. Howbeit anone, the spider well espide That ennemies were there none saue onely one: And him he sawe so safe, and surely tide, That vp he stoode to stretche him, and anone (His former feare from him now beyng gone) To the top of his copweb, he stept boldely, And in these wordes: began to common coldely. Who are you that lithe there? speake if ye can? Forsooth (saide then the flie) syr it is I, I, be you I (quoth he) I pray you than What I be you? tell me that by and by. What I am I? forsooth sir a poore fly: What thou false theefe, art thou here quoth the spider Thou shalt feele cause, to wishe thou hadst gone wider. And therwithall full furiouslie he flang Towarde the flie, but what tyme he espide him, Oh lord how his feat feete and handes he wrang, Beseching his great god, that day to guide him, And from his mortall ennemie to deuide him: With out whose ayde, from which his foe: to flit, He saw it past a flies poore powre and wit. And his dreadfull dispayre, was muche the more To see how speedelie the spider span, All rounde about his house eche syde to shore, No weauing workman in this worlde that can Weaue that like web of that like stuffe wouen than, In eche weake place is wouen a weauing cast, By warde, in warde, to warde the flie more fast. Whiche done, these woord? the spider sewrely saide, Thou auncient enemie and arrant theefe. Whose lignage alwaie hath shewde banner splaide Against my parentage to their great greefe, And now thy selfe renewing their mischeefe With mallice of thine owne in vre to put, Art stolen in to my house, my throate to cut. And neuer had my house, and housholde harme By any flie, so much as now by thee, I shrew thy naked hart, I was full warme Naked a bed, a sleepe so mote I thee, There as my wife: and all my children bee, Where god knoweth what they do, or how they do, By feare whiche thou at this time bringest them to. The spider sterting into his house to comfort his housholde, the flie deuiseth what way to escape the daunger of the spider. Cap. 5. And with these woordes aside the spider start, Where his saide bedfelow and ofspring were. Saying these woordes: now good mine owne sweete hart And my two babes be ye all of good chere, The present cause of all your present fere Is past, I haue the caiteffe fast in snare, That was the cause of all your fearefull care. What horeson is it husband, (quoth he) wife A fleshe flie as big as a humble bee, That shall (if I liue) surelie leese his life. The yongest spider there, at this cride he, Oh, father father I hertelie pray ye Remembre when ye shall returne againe, To bring me some part of that fleshe flies braine. How say ye to this babe (quoth the mother) Will ye here this vrchin of eyght weekes olde, It is a babling brat aboue all other, Ye (quoth the father) childe hardely be bolde. Thornes pricke yonge, that shalbe sharpe folke haue tolde, Which sheweth in thee, in that thou art enclinde To craue (thus yonge) accordyng to thy kynde. And while the spider dalied in this wise, The flie (considering this extremitee) Did with him selfe, aduisedlie deuise, To scape with life, what might his best meane bee, Softely, as I might here, saying, I see Like as muche contension can nought preuayle, So: to muche cowardise might all quayle. Betwene these two, cowardise and contension, The spiders ire the rather to asswage, I temprately must tempre mine inuension, To plead my right in reason not in rage, And sens my body lieth in iayle forgage, My iayler faire and gentlie to beseeche, That is (in flies no flaterie but faire speeche. From desperate feare: hope makth me now suppose, If I may obteine hearyng reasonably, I nother life nor libertee shall lose, But be let lowse from bondage by and by, And herevpon the spider sodeinely From where he was, returned backe againe, And streight to gripe the flie began to straine, The spider being returned to the flie, after a few woordes betwene them had, the flie sewth to the spider to be herd speake which he graunteth. Cap. 6. The flie (to him) lift vp both hart and handes, And in most milde behauiour humblelie Saide: syr, sins I am bound here in your bandes, Under commaundment thus assuredlie, What brute might breede to you more infamie Then here (in hucker mucker) me to murder, The cause wherefore I die, publisht no furder. Flie: (quoth the spider) I dare say: the cause Is open enough, for a thowsande marke Will not repaire that, which against all lause Thou hast here broken: beholde thine owne warke, Wherin to aunswere all: that at me barke, To whom thy dolefull death shalbe apparant, To them thy diuelishe deede shalbe my warant. Sir (saide the flie) if it in deede so be That this my deede, aparantly appere, So far my faute, that it may warrant ye, To geue me death therfore with consciens cleere, Then as my body is in prison heere, So with my bodie yeelde my will, will I, Unto your will, at will to liue or dy. But syr, before we shalbe so set foorth, I you beseech right humbly as I maie, Alow my sewte, for such: and so muche woorth, To win your graunt (ere I be cast awaie) To here, what I can in this matter saie, So thou with speede show what thou hast to breake, I (quoth the spider) graunt to here the speake. I thanke you humblie (quoth the flie) but sur Of a goose with garlicke sauste: so late I eete, That my breath stinketh, and sins I may not stur From you, for you I thinke it very meete, To step from me: a loofe: to aire more sweete, The spider stepping backe a little way, The flie therwith (somwhat lightned) did say. The oracion of the flie to the spider, commending iustice, and iust iusticers, requiring to haue his cause herd throughly and adiudged Iustlie. Cap. 7. Maister spider, note (I beseche you) this, Ye know right well, the vertue of Iustise, In euery creature here liuynge, is, Both in you spiders, and eke in vs flise, And in euery other wight beyng wise, The thing: which is generally pretended, And where it is in deede, highly commended: And where that vertue, lacketh in any wight, All other vertues, there do bid adew, What vertue can (in place) take place of right, In suche as to shew Iustice, dooe eschew: Who lacketh Iustice, he can not be trew: And who in Iudginge all thinges, Iustly Iudgeth, To choose that Iudge his Iudge, no wise wight grudgeth. Great lett wherin are foure, loue, hate, meede, and dreede, In all whiche iudgementes geuen, adiudgeyng geines, Loue, Iudgth the loued, more, then iustice sheweth decreede, Hate, Iudgth the hated, lesse, then Iustice constreines: Meede, Iudgth the meeder, more, then Iustice conteinse. Dred, in dred of the dreddid, the dredder driues To Iudge, more or lesse, as the dreddid contriues. And tavoyde parshall iudgement betwene partise, Though thone partie for iudge, I wishe none of them, Yet change of minde or matter, doth oft so rise, That the iudge, is iudge, and partie one of them, As you seeme iudge here, beyng the tone of them, Selfe loue in whiche iudge, he thother part hatinge, May iudge muche iudgement, of much vniust ratinge: Ye though the iudge, hate thother partie no deele, That selfe iudge, him selfe, louyng more then enough, Lesse right then enough, thother part may soone feele, Selfe loue, to him selfe tender, to the rest tough, Is, of iust iustice, neither roote, braunce, nor bough, Loue (namely selfe loue) corruptibly growyng, Is cheefe lodester of let?, in iustice showing. For though corrupt loue, and hate: contrarise mere, Woorke one like wronge, both in one like degree linkt, Yet that loue, woorse then that hate: I adiudge here, It is more hard, loue to our selues to extinkt, Then hate to other, to plucke from thart? presinkt, Thus, of iustice no let ledeth intrupcion, Like this loue (named selfe loue) growne of corrupcion. But to the point, iudges that iustice vse, In all, betwene them selues and all the rest, To claime or holde, by wyll who doth refuse, Thinges, wherof they wolde be, or be possest, And euen as iustice, iustly hath adrest, Both geue and take the dew extended rate, Those are (for iudgement) woorthy moste estate. Syns iustice that sweete flowre full fayre doth grow, In persons suche as of most base sorte bee, That floure more fayre and sweete must needely show In those that stande, aboue the meane degree, Beynge therto knyt vnto auctoritee, As more or lesse, who may commaunde at will, So more or lesse, he may do good or ill. And in our case, were iust iustise clene reiect, What iniuries might therby here arise. Of flies factes, if spyders willes weyd, theffect Right soone, might wilfull will, without iustise, Draw vnto death, a hundreth thowsand flise, Which: will may do (if will shall knit the knot) Whether that we flies, offend or offend not. Howbeit I hope ye will do iustice, suche As may with this iust iustice ioyne iustly, In mine accounte your wisdome is to muche, To blot or blur your fame, for any fly, Wherby I stand in trust assuredly, Iust iudgement in this matter, now to haue, And other thing then that, I do none craue. Saue that this case, may be first fully hard: And fully perceyued, by reasonyng lykewise, Whiche done, as equytee, best afterward Shall you aduyse, my iudgement to deuise, Without further apeale in enterprise, I shall (as I say) other to liue or die, Into your handes, yeelde me contentedlie. The spider graunteth the flie both to here and adiudge this case, as maie most agreably stand with Reason, Lawe, Custome, and Conscience. Cap. 8. Flie (quoth the spider) I espie right well, Thy braine is muche, which I right much set by, By which thy present sewte, the treuth to tell, Thou shewest here wittely and honestly, Request wherin, showeth such conueniensy, Full heringe and reasonyng, to win me to: That reason bidth me graunt, and so I do. And for the rest, behold me now (quoth he) Wherwith, his feete to his mouth he tossis, Saieng these woord?, now flie here vnto the I sweare a sollem othe, by all these crossis, Thou shalt haue iustice, though I susteyne lossis, As reasonably may stand, for thy defence, In reason, lawe, custome, and conscience. In cumpas of which foure principles towcht, All debates, discourst, and discust shulde bee, Reason, to perceiue, mans great ground is vowcht: Lawe, on reason: must take grounde to agree: Custome, standeth (or shoulde) on reasons decree: Conscience, with reason concurth: to withdrawe Thextremitees of custome, and of lawe. Upon these foure (eche one) one corner poste, The stintyng of debate, takth standyng stay, Wheron this building, shalbe so enboste, That as I sware, againe I sweare I say, Without corrupcion on my part, this day, Thou shalt be vsed herein, at my hand, As most with reason, and this rest maie stand, They stand both in hope to conuince ech other by iust cause, the flie praiyng the spiders pardon, of suche rude speeche and all behauiour, as he maie chaunce to ouer shoote him selfe in, the which the spider doth graunt. Cap. 9 There neuer was Fryer limiter, that duckt So low, where beggyng woon him twenty cheeses, As is the flie now to the spider ruckte, He makth him sewre to wyn, who euer leeses, And here with all (by chaunse) the spider sneeses, Now (quoth the flie) chaunce I to win or leese. Christ help, and longe in helth wel mote ye sneese. The spider herefore, gaue the flie suche thanke, As hath in vsage, course of curtesy, But note these twaine, so lately so like blanke And both now, in lyke mirth immediately, Me thought, that chaunsed very pretyly, The flie thinketh, reason shall sure make his waie, The spider, thinketh in reason, surely nay. Sir (quoth the flie) I must you here beseeche, To ratefie your pardon my protection In my behauiour, namely in suche speeche As may (by rudenes) rightly craue correction, If I shall lacke your ayde, to this election, Then may my reasonyng, for my libertee, Leese my libertee, and wyn my ieoberdee, This is encluded (flie) in my sworne othe, By whiche I erst haue promysde the iustise, Suche speeche as in thy case dyrectly gothe, So that thou rayle not, to fer out of sise, For whiche thou seemest a flie, as fer to wise, Spare not to speake thy mynde: and vnto me (So saide) say what thou wilt: I pardon the, That pardon I receyue, with hartie hart, And hartely thanke your graunting of the same, The shale now of this nutte, shaled cleere apart, The crackyng of this nutte: to put in frame, For winning of the carnill of this game, To your pardon had, your pacience praying, To here for further serchyng, further saying, Here stoode they both, a while in silent stay: The flie deuising warely what to speake: The spider likewise, warely watcht at bay, What great woordes, out of his mouth, small and weake, Of chalenge or defence, shoulde there then breake, Wherwith at curtesy, low and reuerent, From circumstaunce, to substaunce, the flie went, They entre into the principall argument, the flie supposing no laufull profe by witnes of any ill there against him: the spider allegeth the contrarie, the flie (vpon occasion) requyring to be bailde vnder surety, the spider denieth it. Cap. 10. Maister spider, the pith now to aduaunce: I pray you declare plainly (quoth the flie, How can (by law) in reason this mischaunce Support in you: to kepe me cruellie, To lie in prison, here thus piteouslie, And with your fetters fettring me thus fast, No laufull proofe of cause, by witnes past. No laufull proofe (quoth he) flie saist thou so? What proofe can reason show in law more cleere, Then sight of him that one inche can not go, From present place: where plainely doth appeere, Suche an acte done: as thou hast now done heere. I thinke the falsest flie, of all thy kin, Woulde iudge for haynous, thy thus breakynge in. But put the case, that I atached you, In this my lordship, fast in iaile to sit, But as suspect, no act aproued now, Yet might I keepe ye fast, least ye might flit, Tyll ye were founde giltie, or els a quit, Except this case run right, the law runth wronge, For this is lawe, and lawe it hath bin long. Keepe (quoth the flie) I pray you in suspence, The first aleged case: of these last twayne, Till in this last, law ley experience, Wherby it may apeere, ye may detaine, A flie: suspect of crime, not proued plaine, But vnder surety, out of common Iayle, The prisoner shall at sute, be let to bayle, Let flies to baile: friend flie (quoth the spider) Nay by my fathers soule, that will not bee, Except he here, wilbe suche a byder, That he will sit fast by the feete for thee. And take thy turne: him will I take suretee, Nay (quoth the flie) that trieth a freende to muche, I haue good freendes, but sure I haue none suche. To binde a flie herein, body for body, Were bond sufficient: for a thing thus sleight. Well (quoth) the spider, fly call thou me noddy, Except I proue this a thinge of much weight, But thou alluredst me in way of reseight, Of one flie here, now fastned fast in Iaile, To go lay salt on an other flies taile, The spider chargeth the flie, first with burglarie, which the flie answereth vnto: than the spider chargeth him with single felony, which the flie reasoneth vnto. Cap. 11. This reason dryueth vs now (quoth the flie) Streight to your reason, before suspensed, Wherein mine act, apeering euidently So huge, and heynous offence commensed, As by that reason, it is pretensed. Then lawe and reason both, will that I faile, Of light surety, to borow me to baile. But in mine act apparantly committed, Although the deede, I nowhit do deny, Yet how can lawe, by any wight well witted, Lay in my faute, offensiue fact therby. Flie (quoth the spider) that can (and will) I, And thy reproche, to broche foorthwith at large, I lay (in lawe) burglary to thy charge. That charge is soone discharged, sir saide he, The breache of houses, in the tyme of night, Shewth euidence where those offenders be. But not onely: the sonne doth shine full bright, Ere flies a morning?, cum abrode in sight, But also at eeue, ere the sonne be set, Eche flie to his lodgeyng, againe will get, By this, this breathe, can be no burglary, And ere I now came here, all men might see The sonne apeeryng vniuersally, Though it (at thy commyng) were day with thee, Yet was it night (quoth the spider) with mee, I was a sleepe, and no day yet had seene These two longe houres, had not this mischaunce beene. Sir (quoth the flie) admit that ye now were A sleepe, till that the sonne were sixe howres hie, Coulde any reason, show reason to beare, You to affirme, or firmely verifie, The day for night, till time ye day espie, So were it a thing, easy to be doone, With a winke, to make it midnight at noone. Why fly, at noone: midnight is it with mee, If I at noone be a sleepe: ye (quoth the flie) But if ye against one noone sleeper shall see, Ten thousand noone wakers, night from noone to trie, Ye shall poorely proue, this night noone burglarie, And slept ye till noone: yet in course of the sunne, Ye are not ignorant, how the day doth runne. Well said (said the spider) and put the case, That I in this case, yeelde thee the maistrie, Yet shall this other case (I trow) take plase, I here arrest thee flie, of felonie, Which cause of arrest thou canst not denie, For breakyng in here thus, and neuer knocke, As good or better, were to picke the locke. I brake into this house now (quoth the flie, Like as a theefe doth breake into newgate, Sauyng that the theefe, doth most commonlie Pretend at his entrie there, more estate, For breake a theefe in there: erely or late, He hath as many leaders as a bride, With weyters, attendant on euerie side. And yet no theefe is there of all the rout, That into that house breakth so willinglie, But he wolde rather go ten mile about, To shun this vanitee of vaine glorie, Then be reseiued so honorablie. Acounting his life: no daie the shorter, In taking paine to be his owne porter. And as the theefe, full fer against his will. Doth breake in there, so brake I now in heere, For theefe or flie, what one hath wit so ill, To prease to rob where he hath knowlage cleere, By robry: to steale ought, nought can apeere, Nor no commoditee there consequent, But death, or perpetuall prisonment. The spider (in a maner) graunteth, that the flie cam into the copweb against the flies owne will, which the spider so graunteth, for such policy foorthwith appering: as seemeth to weigh sore against the flie. Cap. 12. So mote I thee good felow flie (said he) That allegacion recheth here, so fer and nere, That in aparance, it concludeth me, For glad or willinglie, who wolde cum where As he shoulde cleerely know, his cumming were An euident and vndouted induction, To his infallible fall of destruction, Wherby it seemeth, I can no way auoyde Thy cummyng here, to be against thy will, But now the flie, so fer is ouer ioyde, That by no maner meane, he can sit still, He stretcht, and fet a hem right sharpe and shrill, Wherat the spider, smirke, and smothlie smiled, To see the seely flie, so fer begiled, And yet showde he, semblaunce of falsitee, So as it might apeere, that he did smile (For ioie) vpon the flies behalfe, that he So wittily wounde out of this exile, Which set the flie, in glorie for the while, In sight wherof: the spiders pleasure had, From laughing looke, to lowring looke full sad. These woord? he sowrely saide, though I now yeelde, Grauntyng that thou camst here vnwillingly, Yet shall the flie (at one stroke) leese the feelde. In all the rest hereof immediatly. Euen with the same weapon, thou wanst this by, As thus, by the daunger that flies here finde, Thou prouest to cum hither against thy minde. This well excuseth thy commyng hither, But (quoth the spider) for thy goyng hence, When we haue scanned these woord? togither, Thy reason is hardly woorth forty pence. It is a perfect proofe in euidence, For my parte, and encludeth breefe conclucion, Of condemnacion, to thy confucion. For though thy cummyng, were against thy will, What hope to helpe thee hense: doth that implie, Sins death here had: or imprisonment still, Is all thy proofe, thy so cumming to trie, Now (quoth the spider) speake out good man flie, This verdit thus geuen by your owne consent, Who can blame me, theron to geue iudgement. The flie herewith is abashed, but a none he gathereth him selfe to a stay shewing a reason, that maketh a manifest show cleerely to ouerthrow the spiders foresaide polycie. Cap. 13. The flie at this, set suche a persing sigh, As made the hart in his poore carkas quake. And clapt his hand, so hard vpon his thigh, That of that copweb, euery part did shake, And time it was for him, now to awake, Suche a chokyng checke, to a flie in cloister, A meane wit maie deeme, it was a chokyng oister. The spider yeldyng to the flies fore saiyng, Was a cast beyonde the flies expectacion. Wheron the flie spiyng the spiders inuaiyng, Thus far against the flie, in aprobacion, He seemed to take great discontentacion, With him selfe, to see his owne woord? geue state, To the spider, to geue him this blinde mate. Howbeit anone, stey in him selfe he toke, Saiyng these woordes, both with good hart and wit. Good maister spider, if ye rightly loke, In all yet past, all knott? betwene vs knit, Iudgement with iustice: shall feare me nowhit, Flie (quoth the spider) tell me that tale soone, We haue well begonne, but nothing nigh doone. And yet euen now: for all thy braggyng bost, Tacounte this case, if we now condisend, The paiment of thacounte wilbe thy cost, For though thou burglary do here defend, And felony, that doth hereon depend, Yet of my purpose, thine owne confession Hath peasably, put me in possession. What though thou didst vnwillingly this deede, Yet thy selfe confessing as thou doest here, Death or dealy prisonment to proseede, What helpeth I say, thy proofe to stand cleere, Sins not with standyng though that proofe apeere. Thy selfe hast confest here thy selfe to be, Deade, or dead prisoner, at least: with me. In deede sir (saide the flie) euen as ye saie, Except my woord? for my now hither c?ming, Maie haue expocicion sum other waie, Then it seemeth they shall haue, after your s?ming, Better for me were to exercise m?ming, Then that my speech shoulde show me suche an elfe, To make myne owne woordes condemne mine owne selfe, But sins my reason, ioynde with your consent, Approueth my c?mige here against my will, By fore knowne death (I say) or prisonment, Then is my reason, to the pointe not ill, For as ye haue graunted, and must graunt still, Discharge me (at full) it dooeth and must do, Of burglary, and felony, both two. And thus this one reason of mine (ye see) Aunswereth all your reasons (saue one) wherby, Ye lay to me, that I acknowlage mee (In maner) by agreement here to dy, Or till I die, here in prison to ly, But once mine answere to those woord? spoken, If Iustice holde, this prison is broken. For though I acknowlage to know before, Suche daunger, as witnesseth my confession, Yet lieth the right or the wronge, still in store, The which must trie, whether your possession, Of me here be laufull or oppression, But haue I knowne parelles here, neuer so longe, Doth that knowlage proue you to do no wronge. If that were true, euery theefe might say, In place where as robberies accustomed were, That he might by custome rob there alway, Be cause custome auouchth that theeues rob there. I see this example offendeth your ere, And so it may: for it proueth by proofe clere, That I am imprisoned wrongfully here. The spider checketh the flie, for his comparing aboue the spider in knowlage of law and custome, which the fly mainteyneth by one reason commonly reported: Wherupon the spider perceiuing the policie, for which he seemed to graunt the flie to cum against his will, taketh little or no place, that much weaking his part, he driueth the flie to draw backe that graunt. Cap. 14. This is a good bragge, flie (quoth the spider, To set in the fore frunt of thy battell, And a meete reason, for an out rider, That wolde by facyng, his ennemies expell, And be ye sure it doth wonderfly well, To see a flie, thinke him selfe presumtuously, Better seene: in law and in custome: then I. For sooth (quoth the flie) no displeasure taken, My lernyng of reason, ought to passe yours, In westminster hall, I am not forsaken, But may be a termer all tymes and howrs, And that in aparance, passeth your powrs, For as common report, maie be a proofe, There neuer cumth copweb, in that hall roofe. The buzzing beyng in westminster hall Of a flesh flie, euery man may forbere As well as my presens. And sure I shall Proue it as hard, for thee to get out here, As thou woldst proue for me to get in there: And ere we depart, I shall turne that Iorney, From personall aparence to attorney. And which of our lerninges also is best, Shall cum to triall when we cum to ende, And my replicacion as yet shall rest, Unto your answere, by which ye pretende To proue me: by extorcion to offende, Wherin in effect, ye say that I laie, No reason of right, your body to staie. In whiche, what matter I haue to aledge, By reason, conciens, custome and law, Not only to keepe you here as in pledge, But also your body to death to draw, That corsey woulde curstly your stomake gnaw, How be it for an ease to your panting hart, I shall (for a season) set that apart. And partly peruse, by way of retret, Sum part of this matter graunted before, Nay sir (quoth the flie) that were but a let, Let vs here retret, or repete no more, Till time that iudgement do try our hole store. By gis flie, thou speakest like a foole (quoth he) The sooner we take ende, the woorse for the. But I perceiue thou wouldst pas ouer this, Therby to win, all betwene vs yet paste, Wherin I graunt thine aduauntage growen is, By meane of my grauntyng, in ouer much haste That thou art here agaynst thy will now plaste, Whiche graunt I graunted, to make thine owne grounde Proue the, in prison here rightfully bounde. And yet my wordes in this graunt throughly weyde, Wey not this absolutely graunted to be. To thy wordes for cummyng against thy wyll leyde, I sayde they (in aparance) concluded me. And that as it semde I must graunt it to the, Which woordes import not ful power to be able, To binde this thus graunted, ireuocable. But sins thou hast found this feate stertyng hole, To hyde thy head in, thus promptly prouided, I will yet once againe, quicken this cole, Whether will or not will, the hyther guyded. Why sir (quoth the flie) then am I deryded. Not a whit (quoth the spider) be content, And olde tale, misrecknyng is no payment. And if thou thinke it an hinderaunce to thee, This part of proces to call backe againe, When thou canst take like aduauntage of mee, I graunt thee, like libertee to obtaine. Agreede (quoth the flie) for when he sawe plaine, The spider, thus bent determinately, He thought it foly him to contrary. They reason a freshe, to trie whether the flie came into the spiders cop web against his will or not. Cap. 15. Flie (quoth the spider) go we to the pith, Thou saist thou camst hither against thy wyll. And thy onely reason to proue it with, Is, fore knowlage of death, or this as ill, Perpetuall prisoner, here to lie still. Concludyng as no wyght were so vnwise, Willingly to cum, where knowen parels arise. Contrary wherof is seene euery day, In seyng dayly that theeues euery chone, Committing robries in any high way, Do know assuredly twenty to one, If they be had, they shall hang therupone, And yet if they totter twenty togyther, Still do theeues rob there, now who leadth them thyther. That do them selues (quoth the flie) and cause why, Eche theefe thinkth to scape thens, as hath scapte mo. Thynke they so (sayde he) then why may not I Thinke, that thou thoughtst likewise from hense to go. Nay sir (quoth the flie) I coulde not thinke so, Neuer was there flie in this net, thus masked, That euer scapte, as fer as I haue asked. Well flie (qoth he) if thou this part wilt saue, Answere well these questions that follow heere. Hast thou had free will: as other flies haue? Ye sir. Is not (quoth he) thine eye sight cleere? Yes sir. Did euer fransy in the apeere? Nay sir. Be thy winges good and eche other lym? Ye sir. And all thy body lusty and trym? Ye sir. Then (quoth the spider) it should seeme Thou art thine owne leader? Ye (quoth the flie) Dyd any wight (quoth he) vse meanes extreeme To bring the? None that I can verefie. Did I send for the? Nay sir verelie. And yet thou art here, art thou not quoth he? Yes sir. Against my will, I assure ye. Well then (quoth the spider) thou grauntst to haue had Free will, and that thou hast good sight of eye, Lusty lims to lead the, and neuer wast mad, Compelde to cum, as who say forsyblye, Or to be sent for, thy selfe doste denye, And yet thorow facyng, thou fainest heere, To cum now hyther, against thy wyll cleere. Whiche false demeanour, consyder who wyll, Doth well aproue the a crafty kynde theefe. Lyeng aud stealeng, wyll together styll. Oh (quoth the flie) this augmenteth my greefe, Thus to be chargde, with desertles repreefe, I am a trew flie, sure I can no false knack?, Alas master spyder ye be to capack?. As by this exsample may well be tryde, Put case free wyll, and your lims led you now, To pas sum narow bridge by sum high waies side, And in that passage, should chaunce (god saue you) To slyp into the diche, and breake your brow, Or els (in a good howre be it spoken) Ye were in perell your necke to be broken. And that while ye were in that diche scrallyng, And scratting in the myre to saue your life, The lorde of that soyle, woulde in that falling Atache you of theft, and then wolde be rife To charge you, as ye charge me, in this strife, Against your will, ye were not thyther brought, But your will it selfe: brought your selfe vnsought. How woulde ye answere this sir (quoth the fly) I woulde (quoth the spider) say that my will Led me not to fall in, but to pas by, What if that sayenge liked him so ill, That he wolde say, he might call ye theefe still, In that for your passing, vnder or ouer, Ye were of your will, let in neyther nother. Then were I dryuen (quoth the spider) to moue, Sum parte of the difrens betwene these three, Will, powre, and chaunce, wherin I might soone proue, That although my will be neuer so free, Yet in actiue thinges, will can not bring mee, To accomplish those actes, for powre or chaunce, Must ioyne with will, ere outward acte avaunse. For woulde I neuer so willingly will, To weare powles steeple for a turkey hat, Yet sins I might in deede, eate a hors mill, As soone as haue powre, so to pranke with that, That will were as wise, as will of a wat, My will: may will freely, this to optaine. But will aboue powre, thus wilde, is in vayne. Will without powre, as in thinges actuall. Can woorke nought, and where powre and will both bee, Chaunce doth right oft, both powre and will apall, Aboue powre and against will, oft we see, That contrary to powrs and willes decree, Chaunce chaunceth so, as when by powre and will We are prest foorth, chaunce charmith vs to stand still. Exsample hereof, let vs here now make. By the saide bridge and diche, that you erst leyde, At which though powre and will, wold vntertake To bring me ouer, chaunce might se me steyde, And both from powre and will, so fer conueyde, In goyng ouer that bridge, that chaunces tryp, Might pop me in to that diche: euen at a whip. They continue in pursuite of triall, whether the flie cam thither willingly or vnwillingly, so fer, that the flie (at length) offreth to take a boke othe, that he cam against his wil. C. 16. This is vnanswearable (quoth the flie, And a reason for my part worth a pyke, As chaunce agaynst wyll myght make you there lie, Why myght not chaunce euen aswell in case lyke Ley me in this copweb, as you in that dyke. Flie (quoth the spyder) thou art not askyd Whether chaunce so myght, but whether chaunce so dyd, What (quoth the flie) if this man did purpose. That question to you, I coulde (quoth he) well Make aparant proofe, on my part disclose, That into that diche, chaunce did me compell. For nought is there to steale, but aparell, And all men know I nought desyre nor neede Those staryng garment? of mire and greene weede. In faith (quoth the flie) and I loue as ill To be in these russet? at witsontide, I weare your gray garment with as ill will As ye woulde the greene, at the diches side, Wherfore this reason is as well aplyde, For my deliuery out of this place, As for yours (god saue you) were ye in case. Ye (quoth the spider) but our two cases Be as vnlyke, as our gray and our greene, Diches be common and open places. Wherin to spiders, and all folke is seene, That nother now is, nor neuer hath beene, For spiders in diches, ought to desyre, By stelth, gift, borowing, biyng or hyre. But what commoditee here is for thee. That is to thee: and to all the worlde hidden, This house is to close thou seest, in to see, And also all flies that herein haue slidden, They haue (as thou saist) so long here abidden, That by returne of any messengere, Tydyng? from hens (I know) thou couldst none here. Wherfore although thou find nought here in deede, Yet I thinke thou thoughtst sure, to haue founde better, Sir though ye thinke, I thought better to speede. Shall thinkyng leade you, without worde or letter, To cast me away thus, the proofe no gretter, Remember (quoth he) and began to tremble, The peryll of your soule, if ye dissemble. For by the way that my soule shall go to, I cam hither against my will vnfayned, Which cleerely declareth, I thought to do No robry here, but fayne woulde haue refrayned, Any part of this house, to haue constrained, Which to be trew (quoth the flie) if ye looke To haue me sworne, I will swere on a booke. The spider not admitting the flie to his othe, the flie bringth in the strength of the affirmatiue for his part: against the negatiue on the spiders side. wherunto adioyned his other reasons leide in discharge of charge past, he hopeth according to Iustice promised, to be streight discharged. Cap. 17. VVhy hast thou (quoth he) thou vnhappy hooke, No conscience to be a periurde wretche, That othe (quoth he) by the way that god tooke, Should: of my conscience nother make bretche. Nor yet any parte of my conscience stretche. Well (quoth the spider) yet wolde I be lothe, In this case, to trust a flie by an othe. Sir mine affirmaunce in thaffirmatiue, In law and reason, is much more credible Then your deniall, in the negatiue, Your nay, to my ye, must needes be fallible. And in case present, it is impossible, To aproue your parte, for how can it bee, That you, the secret? of my brest can see. It is as certaine, that you know them not, As it is certaine they are knowen to me. Then: if I swere that chaunce me hither got, Against my will, were it reason if ye, Sware the contrary, beleeued should be, As well as my selfe, when trewth can apeere, To none but my selfe, as apeereth cleere, I make my selfe sewere, your selfe thinketh not so: Which considered, let vs now consider, Sum parte of this past, ere we further go, Wherin proofe prooueth my cumming hither To be against my will, all togither. Whiche sqwyre shall sqware me, a scantlin well bent, For a right rewle, to show me innocent. And in the eares, of all that ought can skill, Shall discharge me, in all that hath bene layde. Or can be layde, cummyng against my will, How can burglary, against me be wayde. And in this felony, what can be sayde. Thankyng my trewth. I may here trewly say, This wispe, hath wyped all this woorke away. That wispe of yours (quoth the spider) showth want Of cleanly scowring, when all cumth togyther, Proofe of your tale, I take it very scant, To make me take your present cummyng hither To be agaynst your will, for how or whither, Coulde ye thus cum, but ye myght soone deny, To cum with will, as long as ye can lie. Though I can lye, that is yet no tryall That I haue lyde, in whiche sir (quoth the flie) Onely except stiffe or sterne deniall, Ye can aledge no reason to byde bie, Wherin I haue allegde aprobately Your nay, against my ye, can in this case, By no reasonable meane, rightly take place. Now sins this parte, we haue not onely brought, To ye, and nay, and that mine affirmaunce Hath fullie brought, your negatiue to nought, So that the same by grounded sure substaunce, Dischargeth (in effect) this charged chaunce, Perfoormed promise of iustice I trist, Shall from this court, now se me streight dismiss. The spider vpon a case in law touching thaffirmatiue, taketh holde to deteine the flie still in possesion: but yet vnder promise of iustice before promised. Cap. 18. VVoulde ye trudge in post hast flie, nay not so, Ye may reporte in me small curtesie, Except I make ye drinke once ere ye go, I thanke you (quoth the flie) but verelie, I will not drinke, for I am now not drie. Though ye will not tary to drinke (quoth hee) Yet must ye tary of necessitee, Put case your allegasions matche with mine, And furder set your ye, aboue my nay, Yet will I not permute nor yet resine. Possession of your body here this day, For your affirmatiue which ye do lay, Against my negatiue, for without witnesse, Thaffirmatiue doth no tytle dispossesse. Thus: though possession fully not suffyce To be a bar, against your affirmatiues, Yet bryngth possession clause of warantise, By which, I here may keepe you in these giues, (You lackyng witnesse) sum part of our liues, But (quoth the spider) truth, truly to tell, Thou hast (for a flie) saide excedyng well. Concernyng cummyng here against thy wyll, Wheron (as yet) our matter all doth stay, Both partes apeere, of so pure perfight skill, That we haue brought eche other, to the bay. I thee to ye, and thou me to nay, And as in law: thy ye, seemth to seeme gretter, Then doth my nay, which showth thy part the better, For that ye, once: by witnesse well aproued, That thou against thy will dost here apere, Then hast thou woon the whole (as yet) here moued, Aprouyng thy selfe cleerely to stand cleere Of burglary and felony laide here. For by what meane, can any wight make preefe, That any wight without will is a theefe. But for asmuche, as that point is not yit Laufully proued, I entend to keepe The in possession, awhile here to sit, Tyll we this matter wey, sum what more deepe, Nay feare not flie, thou art vnwise to weepe, For I will not all onely not destroy thee, (Unrightfully) but further: not anoy thee. Nor of or on, geue iudgement any way. Tyll tyme thy selfe (if thou reasonable bee) Shalt see, that I may iustly do and say, By iustice erst promised vnto thee, All that shalbe sayde, or doone here by mee. Whiche iustice shall proue me so iust a iudge, That thou nor no flie, shall haue cause to grudge. The spider, seeing that he can not take full hold of the flie in case of burglarie, nor felony: he chargeth him now with trespas, to which the flie reasoneth: Cap. 19. Hereunto for entree toward an ende, Admit for time, thou camst against thy minde, Declaryng thy defence, well to defende Burglary and felony, of eche kinde, Yet thou nor no flie, is so beetle blinde, But thou and they, aparantly may see, That at the least, thou hast trespassed me. I say and thou dost see, a thousand marke, Framthe not this frame, as it framde ere this fyll, Were it then meete, in suche a peece of warke, I crie you mercy I thought you none yll, Or els, I cam hither against my will, Shoulde be full restitucion for the acte, Without a more amendes made in compacte, In case it is, and in case it is not, As by example (quoth the flie) put case That in sum high way, it shoulde be my lot To driue a carte, in sum one such a plase, As from that wayes syde, within litle spase, There were standyng a house on a fayre greene, And I perceyuyng that way muche more cleene Then the high way, streight to that way I coaste, And as I driue, the saide house to pas bie, My carte wheele catchth holde of the corner poaste Against my will and by violencie, Asunder crussheth it, to which haplie The rest of that house, is so bent and bounde, That in defaute therof, all falth to the grounde. In this case: maister spider (quoth the flie) Chaunce the chaunce by day, or chaunce it by night. And chaunce it neuer so vnwillinglie, Yet law and laufull reason, showth it right, That recompence punishe mine ouersight, Law maintainth no man, with or against will, To do an acte so, to any mans ill. But now put case, that within this high way, This house were set, where as my cart should go, Whiche did so crushe the same, that there it lay, For houses in high wayes encroachyng so, Cast I downe one house, or a thousand mo, There am I bounde by reason nor by law, To recompence, the value of a straw. Weyth not the law (flie) these cases for suche, As both in the tone case, and in the tother, The owners hurt to be fully as muche In one of these cases, as in an other, His hurt is (quoth the flie) in thone and thother, Hurtfull a like, for be he leefe or lothe, Downe cumth his house, in either case of bothe. But the doing diffreth, for the first facte I did against the law, as law doth tell, And euery wight is chargde with euery acte, Of his owne doyng, at his owne parell. Wherby the law prouideth very well, Driuing my cart, by aduenture at lage, The hurt in thaduenture I must discharge. But in this last fackte, the fawte (quoth the flie) Is wholy turnde vnto the suffrers side, For him selfe did an acte vnlaufullie, His house to set vp there, whiche deede so tride, My selfe and eeke my carte, law doth prouyde Harmles to saue, for sir the law is strong, In takyng such hurtes, for hurtes without wrong. And in this last case (quoth the flie) stand we, In all this hurt here done, I do no wrong, But all the hurt ye haue, is (ye may se) By your wrong dooyng, on your self a long, What can you spiders, show your selues among, By any kynd of law, what wey ye may Lawfully bylde, within this my high way. The spider (at the flies answering him to a question) chargeth the flie with procuryng of other flies to disturbe him in his copwebs, which the flie denithe. Cap. 20. Thy high way (flie) art thou lorde of this soyle? A poore lorde sir. but if trewth may be sounde, I stand in case to defend this spoyle. What is thy name (quoth the spider) speake rounde? Buz (quoth the flie) with curtsy to the grounde. That name of buz (quoth the spider) doth show thee, Euen for a ringleader, to make me know thee. Of all the flies, that herein haue bene stayde, Neuer was there one in my conscience, But the first worde that euer he hath sayde Was bvz. whiche is aparant euidence, That all flies haue thee in great reuerence, Thinkyng the policy or powre of thee, Shall set them all from hens at libertee. Wherby I may (and do) take occacion, To thinke: that thou hast bene the foole procurer, Of euery flie, that hath made inuasion Into my house, and suche alewde allurer, Ought by good reason, to be kept much surer Then forty flies, suche as thou hast beforne Entiste hither: and then laught them to skorne! Sir (quoth the flie) trewth is my trew recorde, I am giltles of this suspected blame, I haue entiste in ernest nor in borde Any flie hither, nor it is no game, One flie to mocke at an others harme or shame, Nor by entisement to bring a flie, where As the entiser doth sticke, to cum there. And though (as I saide) I can proue it suche, That this high way, is mine for free passage, And that euery flie hath right here as muche, Yet was I neuer so set in dotage, To set any flie (by vndescreete corage) To put possession of his right in vre, To his destruction, and your displeasure. If ye can proue that euer I prouokte Any flie hither, by worde or wrighting, Or by sine of purpose craftely clokte, To possession here, any flie exighting, Then, without mo word? by mouth or endightyng, In our hole case much doughtfull how to try, I yelde my selfe condemde vndoughtedly. They fal in comparison touching their euidence written or vnwritten, whervnto the flie leith prescripcion of custome, (which he before alleged) supposing therby, that the spider ought both to deliuer him, and make him amendes. Cap. 21. VVell (quoth the spyder) though this suspicion Were clerely clered: yet hast thy selfe clere, Brought in an other of worse condicion, As thus: thy claime to haue thy high waie here, Bringth thee suspected, a theefe to apere. This is tholde vse alwaie: all the worlde knowes, Trew men: in at doores, theeues in at windowes. Maister spyder: harpe no more on that stringe. I cum the same waie that your maistership doth, There is small melodie in that harpinge. Conferryng president? with present sooth, Chaungth ofte, the barkyng tonge to byting tooth. Barke or byte who wyll, flie I dare abyde To se tytle present, by president tride. Syr: so dare I then: and shall be well able, To voide your suspicion. and proue my gyse, Not onely lawful: but therto lawdable. What euidence haue you contrary wise. But gnat?, beese, waspes, hornet?, and all we flyse, At creuis, and windowes, with bag and baggage, Haue had egres and regres by olde vsage. This weith as (who saie) thers none euidence Showth contrary, but this waie thine maie be, Whiche is no profe, for thy parte worthe two pence So might I claime euery thing that I see Whiche were in wryting: not forbidden mee But it is not enough, not to be denide, For tytels must specially be specifyde. Sir (quoth the flie) specialties in writinge Specially to specifie: yours and mine, Shoulde we be driuen: to shew suche enditinge That wolde (I feare) blanke both our partes in fine, Our chiefe euidence that we can asine, For profe or disprofe: by any decrees, Standth in vertue, of vnwritten veritees. Flie, this tale weith not a flie taile (quoth he) Canst thou shew ought: of profe or disprofe clere By written or vnwritten wordes to see. But that our posession: shall clere apere, As auncient as thy succession here. Sir (quoth the flie) I sticke not to agre Ye haue byn posseste, here: as longe as we. And longe mote be. For by the god of might, I neuer knew flie: but was with the same, Hartely contente as fer as by right Your owne grounde might beare, to inlarge your frame. But to be plaine, this is the thing we blame, That ye thus of will, without our consente, Usurpe on vs: by meane of encrochement. Good honest flies a thowsande that I knowe, Will saie and sweare: it was thacustomde gise, That spiders builded in euery windowe, In the top: or by the sides in suche wise, As the reste of the latesse for all flise, By comon knowne custome, when we wolde iet, Stode free at libertie: from any let. But this is building of an other sise How maie any flie: this waie easily get, By any waie that his wit can deuise Here is a frame: in such a facion set, As all were fish: that might cum to the net. So fer this latesse is ouer couered. I maruell your-selfe will se it suffered. The case of the carte: in lawe laide er this (Custome adioinde) this waie mine owne to try) Auouchth for me that you haue done amis To encroche or vsurpe vnlaufully, In my high waie, then of reason thinke I, Ye ought: in lawe, custome, and conscience, Both let me passe: and make me recompence. The spider denith the flies discription of custome, allegeyng the saiynge of aunciente spiders for his intereste by custome. wherin anone dothe shewynge eche to geue small credite to other, the flie moueth to put the mattier in arbiterment, which (as yet) the spider dooeth not graunte. Cap. 22. Lawe and custome, those twaine of thy laide three (Namely lawe) somewhat resoned here haue byn But of conscience (saue that name, namde we) No worde was touchte, since we did firste begin. Tyme comth not yet, to bringe conscience in. Of lawe and custome: to ease rygours force Conscience at last course: procureth remorce. But thy carte case: and al cases last laide, In charge of trespas thy parte to defende May be determinde (for ought here yet waide) As thei on lawe and custome do depende whiche thou doest alledge, with me to contende. But thy descripcion of prescripcion here In our acustomde rightes, I denie clere. Flie: I can bring foorth spiders trew and olde, More worshipfull then thou canste bringe for the flyse To swere that to them, their forefathers tolde Tyme fer beyonde minde, customes exercise Aproued vs to bylde in as large syse, As I haue bilded here. and in thy plat, Ten or twelue holes, to crepe in and out at. Towchyng custome, thothe of ten thowsande flyse Can (by waie of witnes) brynge nought to ease In flies credence, to spyders, there doth ryse No dyffrence in othe, the woorth of a pease Betwene a thowsond flyes, and a thowsande flease. Naie flie (quoth he) and shoke him by the neb There shall no flyes othes, minish this copweb. Where ye (quoth the flie) thinke flies perciall, For witnes herein, that chalenge maie be In spiders and flies in this case equall, Sins spiders be parties as well as we, Why shoulde not we feare percialitee, As muche in you: as you thinke it in vs, And truste you as little, this standing thus. But reason (saide the spyder) ye so do. Then can this trespas not be tride this waie: We are at ye and naie againe bothe two. For you no credence geue, to that I saie And I as little credite that you laie Naught grauntinge eche to other: but deniall, How can we twaine determine then this triall. If (quoth the spider) I wolde condiscende To bylde in corners: at thine assignement, And streight let the passe, we were streight at ende So were we (quoth the flie) were I contente, At your onely woorde, my lyfe to relente. Of whiche two waies, if the tone nor the tother Be reasonable, let vs looke out an other. What waie (flie) by thy faithe canst thou espie That maie seme mete: to make vs twaine agree, If I be the deuiser (quoth the flie) Then shall you choose one, whom it pleaseth ye, And I an other whom it pleaseth me. And as thei two awarde vpon the whole, We two to bide, happie man, happie dole. So might I haply be happie (quoth he) But I coulde not be: both happie and wice, This prouerbe proueth this a fooles decre, A thinge assuerde, to hasarde at the dyce. It bought and had, to bie at a newe pryce Or bringe a certentie for any saiyng, To an vncertentie: by douwtfull daying. All thinges considered in this tyme and place What were wy wit: to put this thing in vre, What coulde I win by that caste in this case And what couldst thou here lese sins thou arte sure, at wyll, in my hande to die or endure. The worste of this weie were hurteles to the, And the beste of this waie: fruteles to me. The flie (after a fewe woordes concerninge appeale) doeth bresely recapitulate theffect passed in the principall case. Ca. 23. Syr: if ye consider nothinge but winnynge, No doubte (quoth the flie) it is so in dede. But by your promesse: made me at beginninge, Of iustice here, I hope no haste of spede, For gredy gettinge shall make ye procede, Contrary therto in hope of whiche dealing, I did at beginninge reuoke apealyng. But if your dealyng: deale dole otherwise Contrarying iustice erst graunted here, My reuocacion of apeale lykewyse I wyll reuoke, and as thinges nowe apere, I muste reuoke that reuocacion clere. Or els that iustice here: although ye wolde, Can not (acording to your promesse, holde. For so is nowe this matter brought aboute That it to iudge: neither can you nor I, We both be parties so perciall that this doute Muste be discuste and iudgde indifferently, By folke indifferent, which if ye deny, In suche fourme as I haue here erste deuised, Then by the Iustice whiche ye erste promised. I claime thre comon lawe. where I am sure, To saue me safe from harme, that lawe hath grounde. For if your euidence, be put in vre, That is so sleight, I shall be gilteles founde. And being silent, if no witnes sounde Then this bondage of prison to discharge Proclamacion streight, shal set me at large. Naie sir: ye must paie your fees er ye go. But goth my parte, flie in thine opinion, No nere vnto the pyth? for sooth syr no. Your case in lawe: is not worth an inion. Well flie (quoth he) sins thou arte a minion, Of so large learninge: I praie the teache me, Sum lesson: in this tale to beleue the. That lesson shewth here, not so ferre behynde In lacke of learning as of remembrance, For if it lyke you, here to calle to mynde By brefe recytall: the very substance, Argude (as yet) betwene vs in this chance, I doute not in the same your selfe to se Cause, in my former wordes to credite me. As thus, ye remember our mattier paste Your selfe hath deuided into partes thre, Burglary, felonie, and trepas laste. And firste: for burglary ye saw: and muste se, That flies: by nature no night theues can be. And though we coulde: yet might your selfe in sight, Witnes with me: to cum nowe by daie lighte. And vnto this: touchinge the seconde charge, Whiche chargeth me with single felonie, I am assured: you serching at large, Remembring my cumminge vnwillinglie, Shall well perceiue, my pure innocencie. In talke wherof: the trewthe muste make vs saie, That we at length: were driuen to ye and naie. Wherin I proue, that mine affirmatiue: Your negatiue, so crerely doth confute, That I dare saie, any iewry alyue: (You letting not the case fall to nonsute, But stande to triall, in that we dispute, Shall, (upon hearinge: what this mounth vntill) Geue verdite with cumming againste my will. And thirdely: in trespas you charginge me With the hurte of your howse: I nothinge doute The carte case shall make iewry and iudge se. This trespas on my syde cleane scraped out. And this debate at ende so brought aboute That in this lates: lawe shall well aproue, The holes all mine, and you to bylde aboue. Now sins of vs twaine: no one can be iudge, Because we be both extreme perciall partise I wonder what cause: doth cause you to grudge, At the arbitermente that I deuise. In these thre saide cases there can arise, In your recouery by the comon lawe, None aduauntage, to the value of a strawe. The spider puth a case in appeale, ill (in apparence) for the flie, as the spider drawth it: and anone he by example of the lordes will: had in courtes of copie holde, seming to leane towarde will: the flie laboreth to qualefie that will. Cap. 24. Thou shalte (quoth the spider) in this strife all Answere thy selfe by thy answering me, To one question: whiche nowe demaunde I shall. My felow flie, I put this case to the. That this same daie, at London chaunste to be, Some man committing suche a heinous dede, That death (by lawe in London) should procede. The whiche dede: being at Louane committed, Lawe (there) for that dede no death doth prouide. The faughter herin, so wilely witted, To saue his lyfe, apealth to be repride. From London to Louane, there to be tride. Were it (flie quoth he) reason in this case, That this mans apeale shoulde take any plase I thinke sir (quoth the flie) it were no reason To graunte requeste of suche apeale in cace Of crymes, deseruing death, at any season. But thoffender being taken in place, Where he hid the dede, to stande to the grace, Of lawful lawe, in that precinkte presente. Whiche: so iudgeing him, I take iuste iudgemente. Quoth the spider god haue mercie on the. Amen (quoth the flie) but why speake you that? I speake (and praie) it euen of charite. Neuer was there yet, any larke or wat, Before hawke or dog, flatter darde or squat Then by this answere: al thy matter is, Thou haste condemde thy selfe, now in all this. How so (quoth the flie) thus (quoth the spyder) Thou grantst, where faughters do an enterprise, Whiche, worthy death the lawe doth cosider Thenterpriser shall apeale in no wise But take suche chaunce, as by lawe there doth ryse Adewe arbiterment: and nisi prius, In stede of twelue or twaine: one shall nowe trie vs. What one shall that be? my selfe quoth he. Thy dede done here: hath by lawe here, death sure, Alonely to be tride at wyll of me. At mine erste sewte, (saide the flie) here in vre, Ye promised iustice to be so pure, That with or against me, ye wolde nought do, But as my selfe in reason muste grete. Wherin we being cumminge towarde the pointe In performance of promise: to see triall, Nowe is iuste iustice, so iotted out of iointe, That ye here vniustely, stande at deniall, To do me iustice, and wolde by power ryall: Directe mine acquitall or condemnacion, Euen as wyll in both: weith your acceptacion. Flie: doest thou waie my will herein thus lighte? In euery pety courte of copy holde, All grauntes that passe, passing in their moste mighte Passe to holde at lordes will, and so enrolde. Syr (quoth the flie) copy holders of olde, Holde to them and theirs, at wyll of the lorde, As with custome of the maner doth acorde. But this terme custome: standeth not here idle Custome (in many cases) semeth to me, To tenauntes a bukler. to lordes a bridle. From trespassing wherin if tenauntes se, (On their partes) customes kepte as thei shoulde be, The will of the lorde moste wilfully bente, Winthe nought worthe a bente, by customs extente. Were this windowe your maner in freholde And flies here your copie holders knowne clere. And that I: being your tenaunt, ye wolde Ley in me, breche of custome to apere. Yet shoulde not your onely will be iudge here. For as thomage (vpon their othe) present, So custome bindthe the lordes wyll in iudgement. Flie: thinkste thou this case a bukler for the? This case: to our case (quoth the flie) being scande Is nother sworde to you: nor bukler to me. With sworde and bukler we maie goe or stande, Betwene bothe cases and touche neither hande. This case: to lordes and tenauntes: is concurrant. But you are not my lorde, nor I your tenant. The flie claimeth all holes in all windowes to be flies in freholde: and that spiders shoulde builde by the sydes or in the toppes: whiche case to be tride by law or custome, thei in maner agree: but the flie mouing it to be tride at the comon law, the spider refuseth it: whervpon ariseth mattier of digression, in which the flie commendeth the spider for expedite heringe herof, brefely definyng the propertie of iustice, mercy, and tyrannie. Cap. 25. I take not my selfe apointed to pates, As you will set limittes and bownds fer or nere But clerely I claime: all holes in all lates, To be flies freholde. as maie right well apere, Where I discribed when I prescribed here. Your aunciters buildinge: the sydes and the top. As flise at libertee, in and out might chop. And as lawe and custome or the tone of them, Shall iudge this pointe: wherin standth muche parte of all, To that will I stande: refusinge none of them. Standinge with your plesure this case so stande shall, Then quoth the spider take custome: let lawe fall. Lawe can little saie herein. Lawe muste refar, The iudgement, to custome to make or mar. For trew trying of custome. Sir (quoth the flie), The lawe (please it you) maie trie how custome weith, What lawe flie? the comon lawe syr thinke I, Where shall we trie flie: what that lawe herein seith? In westminster halle syr. Why flie by thy feith, Woldste thou place this case: wheron hangeth the sum Where (thou saiste) I nor no spider maie cum? How fer arte thou from thequitee towarde me, That thou desyrest in me towarde the to growe Thou woldste bring forth a thousande flise for the, Where no one spider: for me maie make showe. And so by stelthe woldste win mine ouerthrowe. The lawe is one grounde of fowre (quoth the fly,) Whiche your former graunte, graunth to trie all by. And though custome (as who saie) in respecte Of triall in this case: is it selfe lawe. Yet (I saie) lawe, for foorme in pleding directe, Aparence of that triall forthe to drawe, Is mete to be had. I graunte thee that, dawe. But not without this, that we both do agre, The pleding to be: where both present maie be, It is meete (quoth the flie) and by you well weide. (Urgente cause excepte) where mattier shall procede, Againste any person: or persons leide, That he or thei answere presently in dede. And in greattest crymes, this hath greattest nede. For in crymes moste criminal: that lawe is peine The charged partie: shall no counsaile obteine. Whiche shouth that lawe: in moste nede, least helpe talow. Wherto: if the partie be kepte in absence, So that he: nor no man for him maie auow, Any worde in plea: pleadid for his defence, This law is sumwhat sore, in my conscience. Though faire tales in mine eare, peinte this a feire cace, Yet in mine Iie: this case hath a crabed face. Sins ye denie me not lawe: but ye denie, To pleade this plea: where ye present maie not be, Of that denial: apeerth so good cause why, That I shall not only moste gladly agre, To haue it pleaded where we both shall decre, But also I reioice: that your selfe espieth, This gall in this case: and what ill therin lyeth. One other ioie (with many sorowse) I haue. The cause wherof, commendth you vnspecablie. In lesse tyme (in maner) then my selfe could craue, After I am broughte here: in prison to lie, It stanth with your plesure: moste charitablie, To here, ye and determine out of hande. How my case standth, and wherto my selfe shall stande. Oh (maister spider (the selfe dedes done in this, Commende you more, then may pen or tunge of man, Thatachid of suspicion: or facte amis, Enquerie at full had, quickely as ye can, As iustice iudgeth, streighte to dispatche him than, Not letting him lie: tyll his lyms rot or lame, Iustice and mercie: both concurre in the same. Flie (quoth the spider) fauour is not al loste, Shewde vnto the, for thou canste consider it. But many other flise therbe in the coste, In hauing lyke fauour: the diuell spede the whit, Thei do ponder it: wherfore it is not fit, When chaunce or deserte: flise into prison strike. To vse frowarde and flexibill flise: a lyke, Iustice (quoth the flie) weith what, and why to do. Not to whom to do, by fauor, mede, or frey, The man is not the marke: that iustise shooteth to, The mans matter: Iustice shooteth at alweie. Betwene god: and the diuell: Iustice doth displey, His baner indifferently. Yeldinge eche parte, In all dewe dewtise, the very dew desarte, Mercy: ioynde with iustice doth either remit Or qualifie peines, that dewe by iustice seme. Tiranie not with iustice, but against it: Not weiyng deserte, awardth peines most extreme, Tyranie, and mercy, thus maie we here deme Tyrany: not with but againste iustice showth, Mercy with: and not against iustice growth. Iustice place I here, in the middes as who saie. Mercy on the right hande of iustice to stande. Tiranie on the lefte hande. now if we sweie, From the streight lyne of iustice: to either hande, That sweie muste nedes bringe our sweiyng to be scande, As we maie apere to sweie aparantly, Either towarde mercie, or towarde tyrany. But in leaning to any hande of these twaine, From sole iustice: when we encline to decline, As comon welthe in this case maie vs mainteine, From corrupte construction, this case to define, I wish that we: eche as our callinges asine, Maie leane to that hande with mete strength, or vigor, That mercy leanth vnto: rather than rygor. The flie (for cause here appering) desireth to repete his distinction of iustice, mercie, &amp; tiranie, which the spider denith, wherwith the flie leith to the spider, breche of a promes made to him before in discharge, wherof the spider answereth. C. 26. The spider hunge downe both his hed and his lyp. Like one y? had nought: or wist nought: what to speke. Wherwith thought the flie: I haue geuen him a nyp, These distinctions: haue shewde his parte so weke, That studiyng for matter: he findth none to breke. But where he thought the spider in study depe, He was deceiued: the spider was a slepe. And herwith sterting awake, fy slouth quoth he, I had forgot my selfe. I herde my selfe rout. Naie sir (quoth the flie) ye had forgotten me, The beste parte (for my parte) ye haue slepte quite out. Naie not all flie: for I put the out of dout, Of all thy wordes had: in my commendacion, I herde euery worde: and can make relacion. But thine entre: to matter more serious, Brought me a slepe: but I prey the hertelie, Whats the pointe of that case so imperious, The pith is the distinction: quoth the flie, Betwene iustice, mercy, and tyranie. Whiche: sins you herde not: and it muche mete to here I shall repete to you in forme brefe and clere. That wolde (quoth the spider) make me slepe againe. And phisike forbidth me to sleape twise a daie, Repeticion hereof I denie thee plaine. Reason, lawe, custome, and conscience: ye saie, Shal (quoth the flie) all our present matter waie. But touching reason, lawe, custome, and conscience, Two of those fowre principles: are gone euen sens. Which two (quoth the spider?) these two (quoth the flie) Reason, and conscience as how flie quoth he? as thus quoth the flie. Ye retreted latelie, And reuokte a case: which ye had graunted me, Touching cumming here: against my will to be. At whiche: when I grudged: ye made me promise, To haue in the lyke case, lybertee lykewyse. And nowe when I wolde (not reuoke) but repete This pece: for my parte, ye plainly that denie. What reason or conscience is here to gete, Good reason: and good conscience: felow flie. But since reason is sufficient this to trie, Let conscience (I saie) staie: till the laste instante. Least narow conscience, resons wyde scope might scant. And vpon perusing: let reason streight iudge, How far fled from reason: thy selfe herin arte. My retreted case (wherat thou didst erste grudge) Is: of matter present: a principall parte. Betwene whiche: and thy case thou maist driue a carte. Distinction of termes: in our maine matter mente, Is (at nexte) a very fer set incidente. But though thou wilte saie, thou canst draw this thy case. To stande with (or within) our gronnde principall. Yet is it nedeles, to be brought here in place. Distinction of these termes: and other all. I knowe: and can weie: as well as a flie shall, This degression: in tellyng: loste tyme before, And now in repeting: it wolde lese tyme more, Sir: it maie lengthe tyme: but not lese tyme: frende flie, Lengthe of time: is no losse of tyme to the in dede. Lengthe of tyme is thy geine: but I lese therbie. Long tyme winth the long lyfe. And leseth my quicke spede. Which I shulde quikly haue: weare this quikly decrede, Of this my frewtles walke: auoiding the waie, To wyn weie more frewtfull: this waie lets asaie. From pith of this proces (flie) where we fled out, Thether retrete we: more losse of time to flee. This repeticion whiche thou woldste bringe aboute, As winnig therof winth nought at lengthe to thee, So lesing therof leseth nought at lengthe by me. Sins repeticion, the flie coulde not recouer, He shoke his head, and so lete it passe ouer. The spider (reducing the fly to the principal matter) moueth the triall to be had in his owne lordeship: which the flie misliketh. wheron ensueth a glaunce at the diuersitee of gouernemente, betwene one spyder and twelue flise. Cap. 27. Ere while (by prescripsion) of old fliese thou leydst, All holes in lattes: to be other fliese and thine. In which prescripcion against vs: as thou seydst, Acustomed right in windowes doth define, In the top and sides: our building to assine, Which I denide: saieng our forefathers old, Prescribed for vs, to byld here: where we wold. Upon this issue thou sheudst thy selfe content, That custome should (being pleaded in lawe) Iudge how the case standeth by customes extent. Pleading wherof: to common lawe thou didst drawe. Pleading wherin: as thou saidst: and I sawe, Should be in such place as I could not cum to: I denide triall there, and denie it I do. Which deniall to be reason, thy selfe told, And here: from purpose principall: out fled we By thy digressing. But againe to take hold, And go foorth therin, now let vs further see, (Sins the common lawe) is as vnmeete for mee As meete for thee (to pleade custome herein) What other meete meane: for vs both, we may win. What thinke you (quoth the flie) freend flie this thinke I, Sins I will not: and thou canst not, go hence, So that we both shall remaine here presently, To here and answere in personall presence, Lawe, in my lordship: must trie customes defence. Be ye there againe (quoth the flie) by my say We shall catch byrdes to morow: and flies to day. Will is now cum in againe: and must be cald law, By thy ground laid for copy hold at will, It seemth: thou needst not care for my will a straw, As thomage presenteth (saidst thou) good or ill, So doth the lords will, in iudgement saue or spill. So should the lordes will do sir, I therin ment, But here goth the hare away: right to preuent. I: being nother spider, nor spiders peere, Nor spiders tenaunt, nor spiders freend (ye say) I may haue quick speede: and faile of good speede heere. Though thomage shuld vprightly the verdite lay, And the lord (in iudgement) with the right likewise way, Yet sum say, sumtime, that the law is eended, In sum case, in sum place: as folke are freended. And I (quoth the spider) being nother flie, Nor to any flie, of aliaunce or kin, Nor taken any flies frende: why may not I In any pleading place: saue that we be in, Dought there (as thou dredst here) good speede to win This case shall kepe our case: as the case now falles, Both from westminster hall: and all such law halles. Thou being abrode, buzzing in euery place, Where thou hast more freendship, or les enmitee Then I haue: thou maist in eury place purchase Freendes against me: mo then I against thee. And when we in pleading, ioind in issue bee, Thou maist finde freendshyp, to impanell the quest, Of twelue such freendly flies, as seme for thee best. Whiche kinde of triall (for my parte) I lyke nat. Wise lernde counsaile, costly fine pleas firste deuise, With coste and peine longe folowde. And after that, Twelue vnlerned rude ignorant corrupte flise, Shall strike the stroke, as blinde affection doth rise. By excellent wittes: lawe is euer begoon, And by ignorant wittes: ende of lawe ofte woon. Whiche to helpe, were I one of the procurers, I wolde thinke it far better to breede vp in broode, One wise trew iudge: then twelue folish false iurers, It is (quoth the flie) as olde flise vnderstoode, Not more harde (for spiders) to spie twelue flise good, Then easy (for flise) to finde one spider noughte, And now note we here: to what ende this is brought. In place of twelue flise: were one spider plaste, To geue verdite and iudgement: of matters clere, Yet might that change bring smal good spede: in great haste, One wyly lernde spider might hurte as muche here, As twelue vnlernde blunte flise: by ought doth apere, And twelue good flise shulde (for all flise are not yll,) Do more good then one yll spider: wey who will. Betwene one good spyder: and twelue ill flise, Or those twelue flise good: and that one spider yll, Apte comparison (quoth the spider) doth not here ryse. But that one: and those twelue: draw we here vntill. (To worke good or ill) of one good or ill wyll And so then beste or worste, twelue or one: let vs try, Thone beste sorte of two: to gouerne windowes by. And the one spiders parte (in this parte) Ile take. And ile take parte with the twelue flise (quoth the fly) Ile ley firste (quoth the spider your parte to shake,) Resons: leide by a learned clerke formerly. For the rule of one ruler capitally. Whose arche articles here togither to wey, In these nexte woordes here togither: I will ley. Exampling the gouernement of one moste hie, He puth the three persons: whiche three, are god one. And further he bringth in (this texemplifie) The ship, on one keele all partes stande: eurychone. The house: standth vnder one top rafter alone. Thoste, vnder one captaine. Bese vnder one be. The cranes one crane. the herde one shepherde saith he. To this (quoth the flie) an other clerke answerith. Similitude of god and man. To man and man, As far wyde: as far fet: the matter varith. And lybertee (being gods great gifte to scan) To take from all, no one by autoritee can. As who saie: any one mans autoritee, Shall not or shulde not, lese all mens lybertee. Further (he saith) one mannes iudgement is subdewde, To yll affectes, soner then many can be. As one booket of water (in reson vewde) May soner be poisoned: we in reason se, Then may a poole or a ponde, and more saith he, Though one crane gyde all, where euer cranes range, Yet: nowe this one: then that one: thei ofte times change, Whiche exsaumple partely doth your parte apall. For it as muche maie a senate signify. As one: one tyme chosen, all times to rule all, And where all beese folow one bee: vnchangeably, Yet is that bee: of a more exelensy. And of an other kynde: then thother beese are. As the sheperde aboue the herde: he did declare. This laste sample moueth choice of one ruler in place, Of a more exelent kynde, then the reste be. The saide lernde man (quoth the spyder) in this cace, Repliyng to your clerkes resons, this saith he, First where your clerke saith: one wightes auctorite Can not take all from libertee, this man seith. Tis not lybertee, to liue as mans will weith, But to liue in thordinance of good lawse. And the order of nature (saith he) assinthe, Sum to serue, sum to rule, as aptenes drawse. The weake wit: stronge of body, to seruice enclinthe. The witty lernde head, reason towarde rule combinthe, And a kyng calde in scripture goddes anointed, Hath (of god) giftes aboue the reste apointed. God promiseth to rule the hartes of kynges, Whiche gifte showth a kyng aboue the reste, And where it is more harde (by your clarkes saiynges) To corrupte many: then one, so our clarke witneste, More easy to finde one good, then many thus seste, Thargument of these two, and our clerke anone, Chokte your clerke with one reason ioinde hervpone. These thre kyndes of comon welthe, he tride. Of a kynge, of the peeres, and of comons laste. In whiche as there maie be: three good rulinges weide, So maie be in these thre, thre yll rulinges caste. In rule of a kynge, tiranie may blow blaste. In peeres, vsurping. In few comons gouernance, All to be gouernours: maie them selues auaunce. Now: whose contrary is worst (saith he) that? beste. But tyrane is worste of these thre, ergo, Rule or reigne of a kyng is beste: manifeste. This is the conclusion of our clarke: and so, Thargument (in effecte) endth without worde mo. Which: for rule preferde in a senate or prince, For one or many rulers, doth thy parte conuince. Syr (quoth the flie) these olde clarkes clarkly saiyng, The repeting therof let vs leue of quighte. And fall we to reason: of weighty waiyng, Experience, herein sene in our owne sighte. On whose syde these or these lyke cases run righte. Beet (quoth the spider) but ere we enter that, Here me clere a case: that might displease sumwhat, In that we (in this case) draw nere to compare, A spider to a kyng: and flise to a senate, Coniectors that capcious or curious are, (If cause shall: to them: our talke communicate) May chaunce to coniecte: that we two derogate, Those two estates, in that we two do deuise, To cowple kynges and peeres, with spiders and flise. But witnes thou with me, as I wyll with the. That for my parte I know: and for thine I trow, We no whit meane those states: Imbased to be. By our talke, as a kynge in propertee to show. Lyke a spider: or comparison to grow. In flise and a senate. For propertee of flise, Moste rude of vs. Not so rude: that tenterprise. Syr (quoth the flie) as you here for your selfe saie, So may you here assuredly for me sweare. This example meane I: to respecte no waie, But only thorder of rule: that those states beare. And so resembling them and vs, I whyle eare, Entended, by waie of example, to treate. And do so (quoth the spider, an ende to beate. Then (with your fauer) haue at it (quoth the flie.) Passing from all former clarkely argument, To our owne experience familierly. For flise gouernement, Ile shew good reason bente. By sample of a senate. Standing in extente, At this present daie. From hundrethes of yeres paste, To this daie prospering, and so lyke to laste. It selfe being but a citee. Doth yet possesse, Kyngdomes: fer from it: in ciuile order suche, As no kynge hath one realme in more quietnesse, Iuste iustice goth forth there, who euer gruche. Their people obedient, few other so muche. This sample of senate: for flyse rewle I saie, Againste one spyder, or one kynge here I laie. The moste (quoth the spider) that this makth for the, Is that, that senate: rewlth as well as a kyng. To whiche one senate (for mo there none be) Many kynges, in many realmes: haue sole gouerning. Eche one of whose gouernance, all (or moste,) prouing. In both kyndes of comon welthe: since thei began, As good as that one senate, scan who can scan. One kynges rule as good: as one senates rule is, Compareth herin (For rule) both our partes euen, And many kynges rulyng so, the nomber in this, Shouth thy side, to the worste shore to be dreuen, And by one reason mo, more weakenes is geuen, Unto thy parte: whiche plainly shall apere, In these my nexte wordes, now folowing here. Although those senatours in sondry respectes, Seme equall for gouernance in open show, Yet in other sondry respectes profe directes, Show: of one amonge all: aboue all to grow. One hath of all, chefe place, and reuerence we know, In whose estate: staie of the reste doth moste stande. Hauing voice, as muche as twaine: in his owne hande. In many and moste thinges. Preeminence he hath, Moste lyke to kyngly superiorite. Two partes of three: in senates gyding path. Are drawne out of kyngly rule, in properte. Without whiche: to gouerne well, it will not be. Thus a senates rewle. wherin ye your brag brought, Lackyng aide of a kynges rewle (ye se) doth nought, I coulde (quoth the fly) say more but I will not. This case standth not in our case principally, This law: or that law: what law stande, it skill not. So the law and ministers: geue iustice iustely, My cause is so iuste, that no iuste lawe feare I, Nor for euery faute in lawes: or lawiers geste, To remoue lawes or lawiers, I thinke not beste. Corrupcion in lawes: or ministers of lawse, I wish vs to redresse: rather then remeue, Either lawes or lawyers: without weighty cause, The case: vpon light cause: if we shulde ofte preue, Where it shulde ease one: it myght twenty agreue, Deuysers in suche thinges: may soner deuise, To shew ten mischeues: then shape two remedise. Thou saist well (saide the spider) but to reuolue, Thimpediment in lawe of fonde flie Iurers, I can no waie other waie resolue But wish them: and al pelting procurers, To be quite cut of. As lawles enurers, Of verdites false or foolish: in this or that, Sumtymes thei care not: moste times thei know not what, And sure (I thinke) this sore might be salued sone. Or the smarte muche easde, did discrecion deuise, And diligence put in vre: thinges meete to be done, But to lordes: lawes lawiers homage and iurise, Corrupte frendship: thow leydst erste here in suche wise. As it generally apereth to repine. Against all courtes: asmuch as against mine, As muche? ye and so muche more sir that excepte, Your owne selfe, no wight in your courte I there touchte. Your courte of all officers is so clene swepte, That none officer in that courte can be couchte, But your selfe. For your selfe hath your selfe auouchte, Plaintif, pleader, iurer, Iudge, and iailer. Stop fly (what) from a reasoner to a railer? I cry you mercy. Sir if this do displease, I reuerse and reuoke it streight, for I haue: As small apetight, as I shall haue small ease, To moue you. Well since thou forgeuenes dost craue, Stande vp fly. I forgeue euen as god forgaue. And how our saide case (by custome) shalbe tride, Let vs yet once againe serche how to prouide. Concerning that prouision syr (quoth the fly) If we here (in this your present courte) did make, Agrement: to try this determinately. Though I hope (as I hope) I shoulde no wronge take, Yet humbly I beseche you: for my mindes sake. Sins my hartles harte against this triall swels, To graunte to trie this case sum way, sum where els. Thei agree to be tride by arbitermente, whether all or how many holes in all windowes belonge to spiders, and how many to flies, the spider chosing for his parte, the ant or pismere. the fly choosinge for his side, the butterfly. whervppon thei, thone couple in one parte, and thother couple in an other part, talke togither forthwith. Cap. 28. Now (quoth the spider) by this crosse of ten bonse, There liueth not thy lyke (for a flie) I trow, For tunge wit: thou arte the fly for the nonse. But go to: let vs towarde ende sum wey grow. I shoude my minde laste: wherfore thy minde now show. What waie (as thou thinkste) we may yet best puruey, To knit vp this knot, without furder deley. The beste waie in my minde when all waise are caste, Is that one (quoth the flie) that I touched twyse. To haue bene our triall, in all cases paste. Whiche was: to put the whole in comprimise. Flie: this laste one case: to be tride in that wyse. I graunte thee. I thanke you (quoth the fly) praiyng, That we maie name our daisemen in this daiyng. I name (quoth the spider) a cosin of mine. Perce pismere. called antony ante otherwise. Of person small, of wit great vpright and fyne. And I (quoth the flie) what euer hap shall rise, My graund syre Bartilmew butterfly deuise. Of body big: of wit and speche blunt, and plaine. Well (quoth the spider) agre we on these twaine. Thei did so: and forthwith there lighted by chaunce, Harde by the copwebs side, the butterfly. Wherwith one of the yonge spiders did auaunce, At tholde spiders commaundment, in haste to hy, For the ant to repeire to him by and by. Spede cam so to passe, that at tholde spiders hande, The yonge spider out of hande, brought thante to stande. The spider to the ant, and flie to butterfly (after woordes of gretinge) declare, that thei are chosen their arbiters herein, wherin the ant and butterfly promise to do their beste, and thei then anone draw al fowre together in (or at) the copweb. C. 29. The ant to the spider made curtsy low. Wherwithal the spider to the ant did draw, Smiling and becking on him, in moste louing show. Thei shoke handes: manerly as euer I saw. But for flise, as Stans puer ad mensam showth law, For makyng of curtsy: or shaking of handes, Butterflise pardon flise, bounde hande and foote in bandes, The spider: as of vse in talke new entrid, Frendes are of frendes: the state of their frendes frendly,) Arte how his cosins (thant? father and mother) did. His brothers sisters with all kyn and aly. Thant said thei did well. And in lyke wordes harty, Arte him how his aunte spider and all theirs farde. The spider with thankes to thant, their helthes declarde. The fly of the butterfly, with teares tender, Axte: to know his grandam butterflise estate. With all vncles and auntes, of their engender. The butterfly saide well. And did him animate, To be of good chere. False harte to captiuate. Reason then ebbing: teares of natures flowing, To shew their grefes as reason might make showing, The spider to thant. And fly to butterfly, Discourste their greues a parte: and how thei therin, Refusinge sundry weise of ende: finally, Chose them twaine for arbiters: sum ende to win. And since thone twaine: and thother twaine: are of kin, Thone chooseth thon, thother choseth thother. Both promisde their beste, the tone and the tother. The spider declareth, and the flie graunteth thissue to be, that all flies claime (in freholde) all holes in all windowes to bee theirs by custome: and spiders claime all holes with all partes of all windowes to be their freholde by custom: and after talke betwene them therin had, thant requireth ful instruction of the two parties to them two arbiters. Cap. 30. The spider and fly thanking the other both, Thei foure thervpon drawing to gither all, The spyder: directly to the matter goth. Cosin ant: and felow butterfly: ye shall, Understande: that we twaine do you twaine now call, Not to wey all cases in which we contende, But one, on whiche one, all seme to depende. The fly claimth by comon custome beyonde minde, All holes in all lates: flies freholde to be. And spiders (saith he) by custome are asinde, To bilde at sides or in top: wherto marke ye, I say that custome awardthe all windowes fre, At spiders willes without that: that any flise, Haue ony such right, by customes warantise. That this is our issuee, we do both agre. And vpon this issue, we be both agreede, That you two: by arbiterment shall decre, What custome hath herein: directely decreede. Is it thus flie (quoth thant) yea (quoth the fly) in deede. As conscience in you twaine: for vs twaine shall try, How custome doth stande, so (for my parte) stande I. Thou semste (quoth the spider) a costerde monger. Conscience euery handwhile thou doste cry. I muste (quoth the flie) se sum token stronger. Ere I can suppose you of that mistery. I call not for conscience more comonly. Then you speake of it seelde, flie I tolde the erste. Cause why: that conscience at laste ende shulde be perste. That? now (quoth the fly) if these two now take ende, As I hope thei shall, but here me thinkth I smell, That your cast is: conscience thus to suspende, Firste till thende. And then at thende faire and well, Cut conscience of: conscience so to expell, As when all is done, conscience may saufely saie, And swere: that conscience cam not here this daie. Then conscience or I: the tone shalbe forsworne. Reason, law, custome, and conscience, these foure, To be our growndes in triall: I sware beforne. Then (quoth the fly) in laste ende: of this laste houre, Let conscience cum in: to saue that oth of youre. What thinge can conscience do here fly saist thou? Three thinges sir (saide the fly) whiche I will tell you. Firste conscience as euen balance may euenly wey, What custome yeldth to spiders, and what to flise. Seconde, conscience may wey: what reason can ley, What good and what yll, custome doth exercise: In either parte. Thirdly conscience may deuise. To alow the good: and disalow the ill. Wheron: these two may awarde: as conscience will. These two fly (as my meaning was to take them,) We chose daisemen: to try this by reason clere. But, (not arbiters,) chauncelers thou dost make them. By conscience to iudge, how much custome doth here. And what good or ill, in custome doth apere. Laste case of whiche twaine (by thee craftely couchte,) In thissue that we ioine on: is no whit touchte. The pointe that we pitche on: to try out the soth, By reason (not scrupulous conscience,) is this. Not what custome is, but what custome doth. How good or how ill: custome it selfe is, Is an other farder case. (Which fly, I wis, When we shall try (by conscience with reason) It wyll bringe small brag for thy side to season. For fine: cosin ant, and good man butterfly, What entreste custome doth geue to him and me, How muche or how little: in windowse low or hy, As you by reason agre, so I agre. To this axte the butterfly (fly) what say ye? Since: who may not as he will, muste as he may, I say (saide the fly) as maister spider doth say. There saidst thou wysely (saide the spider) and note. Thou shalte by that saiyng no damage sustaine. If reason win thee this case euery iote, Conscience (by reason) muste me streighte constraine, Tobey reasons awarde, at handes of these twaine. And pas thei with me, I promise mine assente, To vse the gaine, as conscience yeldth extente. So saide and so done (quoth the butterfly) in feith, (Son fly) this is of maister spider well waide. Yea syr (quoth the fly) I here well what he seith, God rewarde his maistership: it is well saide. Pleaseth you (quoth thant euidence may be laide. By your selues or other: wherby we twaine maie, Perceiue (in reason) wherto custome doth waie. Ye (quoth the spider) cosin cum we hither. Thei as far as thei list: withdrew them selues quight. The butterfly and fly: drawing togither, As far, not as thei liste, as far as thei might, Thei two telling their tales, as I shall resight. Whiche two tales though I: as in one time hid here, Yet first thone: and then thother: must here apere. Though two eares in one instant two tales here may, One tunge: in one instant: two tales can not tell, Since thone of these two tales: must stande here in stay, Till thother be tolde, I thinke it will do well, The flise and the butterflise talke to expell, Or suspende. tyll the spiders talke with the ant, Ye may vnderstande: whiche is nexte aparant. Thei (in couples seperate againe) declare eche how he wolde haue his arbiter handle his parte: and firste is here tolde in Their persons the tale of the spider to the ant. Cap. 31. Cosin ant (quoth the spider) that ye be wyse, It is to me knowne. Wherto all folke do know That vnto the wise, few wordes at full suffise. And to your wisdome: I doubte not your show Of friendship, naturally to me to grow. For ye know: as we differ far in stature, So we in kinred: ioine nie by nature. President wherin sought, what olde recordes cary, Shall shew no recorde of solemne solemnitee, That euer spider and ant: did yet mary, Whiche growth (I saie) of kinred, not of emnitee Did I (in you) by ingrate endemnitee Doute here: wisdomes iudgement: or natures kyndnes, I were a beaste: of beetill heded blindenes. Whiche two: in their workinges: to geue or take righte, Nature workth friendely, wisdom workth surely. Though right in eche cause: seme the poste of most mighte, Yet wante of wisdom (whose polycy purely) In sentence or semblance: sterne or demurely Shulde set forth that righte, mighte in conclusion quicke, Thwighte that myll poste of righte: to a poding pricke. As if Crossum caput, lyke an asse in a case. Setting forth a right, homly in rewde termes bare. A witty lernde head: that righte in that place, Did finely pronounce: those two tales shulde declare, Forty pence diffrence, in righte to compare. One tale in two tellers: with one entente tolde, May differ in show: as doth brasse and fine golde. And wisdomes sure driftes had: if natures friendship lacke, To take, here, and tell, that tale: in friendly wyse, That righte with that wisdome: may yet runne to wracke Thus: wisdome to worke surely: by polisise And nature: to worke friendely: both muste arise, To ioine in one: in friendes by friendes required, To obteine thinges: at handes of friendes desired. Whiche policy and friendship: where thei are knit, Against partise: to try thinges in strife growing Thei call crafte: and corrupsion euery whit. But policy and friendship: with partise showing. Those partise praise both: with open mouth blowing. Both standing against folkes: folkes daily accuse them. Both standing with folkes, folkes hourely vse them, But to show our case: out of accusacion. In putting policy and friendship: in vre, Marke this shorte circumstance: in aprobacion. Comprimise, the ende of causes to alure, Two sortes of election: in course doth procure. In choice of the chosen partise: (here meane I,) To arbitrate all debates indifferently. One is: that the two partise in strife meued Do choose arbyters: to them both indiffrent. Thother is: that either party greued, Doth chose for him selfe: such as he knowth bente, To take ende: or leaue ende, as he will assente. The firste waie of both (though it the beste waie be) It can not be had: betwene the fly and me, In this case present, amonge spiders and flise We all: can no one: indifferent prouide, Affinitee, or affection, doth so deuise, That all be partise: on thone or thother side. but might (and shulde) this case this firste wey be tride, Then might ye honestly: leane parcially To neither side, by frindship nor policy. Howbeit this other case, bringth this other cause. The flie, for him selfe. And my selfe, for me. This choise haue chosen: so that this thus drawse A nother my selfe: I choose you here to be. Wherby: in all frendly polisy (ye se,) Of honestie to sticke to my side iuste, Not only ye maie, but also ye muste. And (as I saide) I doubte not but ye wyll, And pray ye do. But promyse formerly, Of knowne rewarde at ende, to flee the yll Of suspecte bribry: though I presently, Rate not rewarde: yet if hereafter I, May you requite: in pleasure one or other, Then thinke your selfe, as nie it as an other. Syr said the ant: your rated rewlde rewarde, Now: or at ende: if I herein apease you, Is not the thing: that I so muche regarde, But at the ende as ye se how I ease you, I say no more: but vse me as it please you. Cosin: well saide (saide then the spider) and sith This pointe is paste, passe we now to the pith. All holes in all windowes (as the fly seith,) Are flyse freholde. And that we spiders holde, Right nought by righte, but sides and toppes on heith. And we (say I) holde all, thus to be tolde. Holes, sides, and toppes, brode, narow, depe, and sholde Upon whiche issue: you two muste first here, And after iudge whiche side bringth profe moste clere. Wherin for me, of auncient parentage, Ye shall here spiders speake: bothe sage and wise. And on the flies behalfe: here now in gage, There wyll cum foorth a sorte of forkte tailde flise That will not sticke to tell, a hundred thowsande lise. And saie: and swere that thei say true: howbeete, Ye wyll (I doute not) truste them as is meete. And whan ye herein: haue done what ye maie To make our euidence shine clere in show. And darkened theirs, your wisdome shall sure wey, The grosse rude butterfly: to ende to grow, What waie ye wyll. And thus for hie and low. After wordes great and many: where few mighte seme fit, Into your handes, this matter I commit. Uncle (quoth the ant) I perceiue your minde, At full. And shall at full: do all my beste. Wherin to do you good: if I can noughte finde, Yet shall ye (for me) stande harmeles at leste. Upon this conclusion these twaine did reste. And now: betwene the fly and the butterfly, What waie was had: ensueth ensuingly, The tale of the fly to the butterfly how he shall vse the flyse parte: whiche done the arbiters withdrawe them selues towarde the top of the windowe. Cap. 32. Good graundfather: since we two (saide the fly) One flesh and blood: by natures woorkyng are, In that I: from you: desende linially As in degrees: our petigrees declare, And that nature: naturally takth care. To see sucsesse: of her sucseded burdes, I wyll not length this peece: with peinted wurdes. But natures zeale I set: to intersesse To you, for me, without moe woordes of me, To do your beste: in this my depe distresse. Wherin: what waie to woorke: as I beste se, That shall I show. But ere we so far be, Here me disclose (for our purposed cause,) A necessary brefe conceiued clause. We here and see: giftes of nature are diuers. Sum be faire, sum tall, sum haue strength, sum wit. Sum: in science: excellent contriuers. Sum haue small wit, and haue much truth with it. With many mo: then now: to moue were fit. And this moue I: to moue here onely now, Diffrence in giftes: betwene the ant and yow. The ant hath gifte of right good wit (no doute.) And therto (for an ant) lernde excellently. And you haue gifte: of pleines sterne and stoute. Not being geuen so much ingeniously: To lerned iudgement: and yet this know I No wighte can proue: from hence to Englandes eende, That euer ye brake promise with your freende. But that ye walde (and durste perfourme the same. And this: to this: in you righte well is knowne. A grounde once in your head, fastned in frame, Let lerned lawiers pype vp trumpets blowne Of rules in lawe: to rule you as their owne. Yet shall their reasons no whit make ye starte, From that grownde on your (or on your friendes) parte. Whiche propertee: is worth ten thowsande marke. In you to me, in case of comprimise, For whiche: againste the ant that cunning clarke, Mine arbiter: I did you here deuise. To holde your holde: in blunte assured wise. Either this matter wholly to recouer, Or saue (at leaste) my side from geuing ouer. The ant is sharpe and fine. As ye are blunte and grose. The ant hath circumspection: ye haue none. You pacstaffe plaine: the ant crafty and close. The ant sciuile, you sturdy as the stone. This saide brefe blunte and sharpe comparisone: Shall show who shouth moste brag to stinte this strife, The blunte whetting whetstone, or sharpe whetted knife. To this the butterflie saide: fly son mine. The grosse blunte whetting whetstone: feare thou not, To matche this whetted pen knife: sharpe and fine, Tell thou to me plainly: what is the knot That I shall knit or vnknit in this plot. And thant shall with a tabor take a wat, As sone as make me shrinke from thee: in that. Sir (saide the fly) our issue whiche ye herde To rype remembrance, here yet once againe. I saie all holes in windowes, are referde, In tenure of freholde, to vs tapertaine. All spiders: in sides and in toppes to remaine. Whiche he denith: affirming thei and he, Holde all partes in all windowes: in tenure fre. In whiche two sides, you two the truthe muste trie, And then determine, as reason can decre. Upon whiche syde: this shall by custome lie. Wherin ye shall haue flies: to speake for me Sage, wise, lernde, and well spoken as can be. And for the spiders parte, it is no doute, Of spiders there will be: a spitefull route. The knot herein: whiche I wolde haue you knit, Is this. Either do me good, or do none yll. If: in this matter ye can win no whit, Then lese righte nought: but let it stande euen styll. As it erste stode. And if thante no way wyll. Geue any place, cum harken in your eare. Wherin he whispred woordes, what I wist neare. Wherat the spider caste iye, to them both. Wherwith: the butterfly from the fly flieth, And the ant from the spider away goth. Eche one of whom (anone) the other espieth, And eche of both to other hastely hieth. The spider: streighte into his house stepte stoutely, The fly: fell on kneeze to his booke deuoutely, Thant and the butterfly, together drew. To thextreme parte of the window: on the top syde. And after saluting in their maner dew, Both studiyng: how thentree shulde be firste aplide. Thei both: casting their eies aboute espide. On thone side: spiders aproching: sixe or seuen, And on thother side, flise ten or a leuen. Neither sorte the other: oughte saluted thei, But bothe sortes to tharbiters: made curtsy low. The ante praide both partes in their aproche to steie, Tyll the butterfly and he (in talke) mighte know, And agre: what waie of proceding shoulde grow. With this thei all, stepped backe and there staide. Whervpon: thant to the butterfly saide. The ant and the butterflie being met in the top of the window, certaine spiders on their one side, and certaine flies on their other side, whom tharbiters cause to stande backe while thei two talke together. Cap. 33. Before we furder wade maister butterflie, No maister sir: I am but a yeman (quoth he) That? no matter (saide thante), as the case doth lie, But: gentilman or yeman: what euer ye be, Since we two come hither: these two to agre, Let vs be agrede: on the nexte and beste waie, To bringe them agrede, in matter here to saie. Our waie wherin (as thinketh me) is this. We both muste banish all parcialitee, That by corrupte affection, engendred is. By affinitee, or consanguinitee, So that we clerely cleue vnto equitee. As of these two: neither of either shall, Proue vs: or either of vs: vnequall. Nay (by my fathers sowle) saide the butterfly, I wyll play no whit of venum mecum his parte, Holde with the hare and run with the hounde: will not I, Such reasons: as out of this blunte braine maie starte, For my frende, run thei right: run thei ouertharte, Out wyll I powre them: and in gods name, For your friende, as ye see cause, do you the same. These two tales (in these two persons) semde here tolde, In thone of plainnes: in thother of policy. The buttehfly spake his thoughte (as he muche wolde.) Thant contrary talked dissimilately. His mouing the butterfly tendiffrency, (Him selfe showing a show to be indiffrent, Semde moued, for this crafty couerte entent. The antes drifte was: the butterflie to driue, From affectionate standing: on the flies syde, Indifferently to stande. While him selfe contriue, To be parciall with the spider. whiche aplide, Might (thought the ant) to the butterflie vnspide, Draw him to withdraw: sum parte of affection, Fore bent in his breste, for the flies protection. But when the butterflie: lyke a stiffe nekte cur, (As ye haue herde) made answere vnto the ant, So that this waie wolde not: the butterflie stur, Thant (on this plaine songe hauing shifte of descant,) Axed the butterflie: cum we this instant? To helpe the spider and flie to take ende, Ye sir (saide the butterflie:) that I entende. If I: for the spider: and you for the flie: Show our selues: not arbiters but partise, Reasoning: eche for eche: affectionately, What ende betwene vs twaine: for them can ryse? More then them selues: in them selues can deuise: I cannot tell (quoth the butterflie) howbeit, Harke what waie is beste, we take (after my wit.) You, reasoning for your frende: and I for my freende, Upon our euidance: to this issue leide, If my reasons seme better then yours at eende, You: alowing them aboue your owne, here weide, Or your the better reasons: in my head steide. I alowing them lykewise: aboue mine owne, Reason may set ende, and time show ende, wel growne. Upon this: thei both were agrede anone. The spiders and flies on both sides: to call nere. Both being agrede: that the ant shoulde propone, The spiders: now standing on the righte hande to here, The flies: on the leafte side, as nie did apere. Both ant and butterflie (eche in a chaire set) To declare the case, the ant his tunge hath whet. Thant declaringe the cause of that metinge, the spiders and flies acknowlageing the same, and that thei come to geue euidence, the flies are apointed to departe while the spiders firste shew, what thei can saie for their parte. Cap. 34. Kinsefolke spiders: and friendes flies: I doute no whit, But in this terrible trembling tragedy, Betwene the spider: and flie: in copweb knit. Ye know: the mischaunce mischaunced lately, And how those chaunces chaunced to chaunce, wherby, The spiders palesse is depely perisshed, And the flies person deadly perilled. Also (I suppose) ye know that we twaine, I for the spider: and he for the flie, Are chosen arbiters. Suche ende tobteine: As euidence shall show: both sides to trie. Whiche to showe (I deme) ye apere presently. Saide one spider firste: and then one flie: all this, We know, and to geue euidence: our cumming is. This knowne (quoth thant) douting whether ye know. How far our auctoritee stretcheth here, To meddle in this matter, here me show. Nomber and weighte of strifes cloudy and clere, Betwene these twaine: many and great apere. Of all whiche: auctoritee haue we none, To touche in this talke, saue only this one. The flie claimeth all holes in all windowse, To pas and repas: to be free for flies all. Alegeing that spiders (by all olde showse.) In toppes and sides: haue place especiall. The spider claimth the whole: in generall. To hering wherof, we our awarde wolde knit, What parte: eche parte shall haue: from all to nowhit. Sir (saide the spider and flie) that erste had seide, This know we, and haue purueide euidence: As clere for eche parte, as eche parte can se weide. Then (quoth the ant) for our intelligence, Will ye friende butterfllie: that the flies go hence? Whyle we here the spiders speake: ye (quoth he) Cosins flies: stande backe till ye called be. The flies stepte backe: the spiders forwarde drew. Standidg before those two: in their cheires set Declaracion: to whom: what thei herein knew, Was deuisde: and determinde. Ere thei there met. Wherein: for entre to let lenger let, The butterflie: streight entring as here enseuth, Thant prouoketh the spiders to speake the treuth. After a few wordes betwene the ant &amp; butterflie, one spider as mought be for all, declareth to those two tharbiters all euidence that all spiders for their parte can deuise: and that done, the spiders are commanded a waie, and the flies bidden to aproche. Cap. 35. Maisters (or lordes) spiders: what shall I call ye? In thing? here now to talke: harke wel this one thing: At my blunte behauour, barke ye or ball ye. If ye bringe in sovistry: or booke larning, To blynde mine eies with: I geue you plaine warning, Tom troth will not be wownde that waie. And therby, Be warnde: to talke trewly and homlily. Thei wyll do so (quoth the ant) I dare saie So will the flies than (quoth thother) I dare sweare. Then (quoth thant) without more delated delaie, What ye spiders can speake, speake while we geue eare. With this, one spider (as all agrede weare,) Standing formoste, and as a bolte vprighte, Soberly saide, with curtsy lowe as he mighte. May it (maisters) lyke you: a spider am I, Of suche yeres, as no liuing flies yeres may, Witnes (by remembrance) my full age for why? I tooke lyfe in this worlde, (olde spiders wolde say) Iuste in the leape yere: before the yll maie day. My parentes (as I am) weare blacke nebde and balde. The longe lyued stocke: of spiders thei were calde. By parte: of my whiche parentes, this I gather, In their tymes, worshipfull spiders (though I sey it,) My father: graundfather: and great graundfather: Wolde saie: as thei harde elder spiders wei it, That euery window: hunge it, stode it, or ley it. All partes of the same: in lowest and hiest, Were spiders freholde, both fardest and niest. And euer haue bene (saide thei) at will to beelde, In parte: or in all: and that thei coulde not know: That euer flie (of right) any parte there heelde. These few woordes of forefathers spiders: make show, In all partes: of all windowes: the right to grow, On our parte. The contrary wherof to waie, No spider: hath herde any spider: oughte saie. Say all ye spiders thus (quoth thant?) ye (quoth they.) Haue ye herde (quoth the butterflie) any wighte Say ought herein: sauing spiders? quoth they, ney. Haue ye (quoth thant) ought els in this to recighte? Ye (quoth one spider) standing behinde all quighte. I haue a counter verse to singe: in this place Whiche shalbe countred, with the flies face to face. Ye shall (quoth the butterflie) singe that verce anone. But we muste here the flies indiffrently. As we haue herde you. Till whiche tyme, be ye gone. Thei stepping backe: the flies forthwith soberly, Stode in their place. Tharbiters glaunsingly, Ere the flies ought saide, in their repairing nere, Had betwene them selues: these woord?, which ye shal here. Upon a shorte talke betwene the arbiters, one flie: spokes flie for all flies, discloseth all euidence for their parte: wher with the flies at commaundemente departe aside. Cap. 36. The spiders tale (? thant) semth a choking choke plum Against flies. Ere ye (quoth the butterflie) gruche, Against any parte, audum altum paltum. This terme fet far from the laten: and mo suche, Lernde in the scoole of ignorance, he spake muche: And vnderstoode littell. But this being staide, An auncient flie: stoode foorth, and thus to them saide. My maisters arbiters I am a fly, Of suche age, as spiders few or none maie boste. My fathers hande writing (for witnes) haue I, That I was bred, in the yere of the great froste, Betore the great sweat. When many flies were croste, Out of the booke of lyfe. Who by extreme colde, Were frosen to death: midaged, yonge, and olde. In all whiche daies: to this daie, I haue herde flies saie: All holes in all windowes, where thei stoode or stande. Haue bene (and be) flies freholde: as their high waie, To pas and repas. And that the spiders bande, Owners of the sydes and toppes onely: are scande. Wherto, I nor no flie (I dare verify), Euer herde any flie, say contrary. Flies (quoth the butterflie) take ye this tale trew? Ye (quoth thei. know ye ought (quoth thant) but by flise? Nay (quoth thei.) Foorth (quoth the butterflie) pursew. Can you (or any of you) ought els deuise: Wherby furder light in your right, maie arise? Ye sir: saide one flie: then standing all behinde, To the spiders teethes: anone, yle tell my minde, That shall ye do (quoth thant) but friende butterflie, Wyll ye firste require them to withdraw aside? Whyle you and I: sum parte of this paste maie trie. Hence (quoth the butterflie) wherwith thens thei hide, Thei twaine then onely there, them selues thei aplide. Eche one with other: togither to consowlt, What frewt: out of this erst saide, their braines could bowlt? Ere either of other: did herein ought breake, Thant deuisde, what waie beste to enter it. The butterflie studied not what woordes to speake, But to speake with voice clere, he coughte and he spit: Till his voice was much more clere then his wit. And yet fer from witles: but plaine blunte grosenes, Showde his woordes: ofte tymes to show witles losenes. The arbiters(in debating theuidence on both partes geuen) can not otherwise agree, but that the same weith euen as muche for the tone parte as for the tother, at ende wherof thei call againe all the saide sorte. Cap. 37. Say (saide thant) your opinion vprightly: What weith this euidence on both sides thinke you? To try whiche side showth beste (quoth the butterflie,) These woordes as muche matter: for flise do alow, As for spiders, so do thei (quoth thant) auow, As muche matter in woordes to alow, in lykewise, In spiders for spiders, as in flise for flise. And more (for thone halfe: welny that spiders claime. The flise do graunte. But spiders graunte vnto flise, No parte of theirs, whiche is to the flise a maime. The flies owne tale: sides: and toppes of windowes trise: To be the spiders, by customs warantise. Wherto: the spiders tale for the flise parte waide, Weith no heare breede in windowes for the flies aide, Spiders (quoth the butterflie) shew them selues here, More siding to their side: then flies to their are. As flies indiffrantly make custome to apere, Sides: and toppes of windowes: for spiders share, And that flies (by custome) the holes: theirs do clare So shoulde spiders: endiffrantly consither, To leie (as flies do) both customs togither. Spiders (quoth thant) take those customes far vnlike. Theirs to grow of righte, flies: of vsurpacion. If (quoth the butterflie) the flies do here pike: That quarell to spiders, in customes vsacion. That is tit for tat, in this altricacion. So that for any thinge: any parte can get, Both partes in all thinges yet, on euen hande are set, But to trie: how good or how ill: custom is, Is no parte of our charge. ye know we must tri: How muche or how little: custom doth in this. Perferring or debarring: cleime of eche parti Wherin, for all laide here yet againe say I Flies leie (where reason and equalnesse be giders,) As much for flies, as spiders leie for spiders. Well (quoth thant) as we both hearde both partes aparte, So now let vs both: both partes together here. How we both: betwene both part?: can the hare starte. Both agreede that all on both part? shoulde apere. Thei did so. And all on both sides setled nere, The ant declaring the pith: of all yet wroughte, Entre to matter more, thant induction broughte. Thant shewth to them all, that theuidence weith to one effecte on both sides, so that all resteth now vpon knowlage whiche parte to credite most: and vpon that mocion, one spider and one flie fall in argument to trie the same: wherin is touchte (partly) the properties of credence, woorship, and honestie: thei agreeing that credence standth vpon honestie, as thus, as euery spider or flie is honest, so is he credible. Which talke ended, thei are all againe sequestred. Cap. 38. Friendes all: ye all erste assembled in partes twaine, Before vs twaine here for both partes haue declarde: By the mowthes of twaine, two tales: which two containe, One effecte. For the matter selfe in regarde, The onely diffrence in both: being confarde, Is this. What one spider for all spiders laith, The selfe same sentence, one flie: for all flies saith. As thus: that spider saide all spiders haue laide, All holes in all windowes: to be spiders freholde. Whiche selfe saiyng: that saide flie (for all flies) saide. In few woordes at full then, theffecte to vnfolde, Both partes present, to this tale is to be tolde, Sum mattier to trie: what apparence maie rise, Whiche parte we shall credite moste, spiders or flise. With this, a well spoken spider stepte in place. Saiyng: if comparison in credence growe, Then muste ye with vs spiders rule this cace, Spiders haue bene and be worshipfull ye knowe. And flies honeste (quoth a witty flie) I trowe? And of credence: the propertie or maiestee, Stanth not more by worship: then by honestee. Nor so muche nother: as all kyndes of flies thinke, No: no colour of cause of credence: can stande, Where as woorship with honestie: doth not linke, And honestie without worship (skilfully skande.) Maie haue: and muste haue: credence at euery hande. If ye spiders woorshippes: for credence do here ley, Flies honesties: shall spiders woorshippes outwey Weare this gaie couchte case (quoth the spider) graunted, More credence for flies: then for spiders might be geste, Which shouth you to deme: as you it auaunted, That no spider: but all flies, are honeste. And all spiders worshipfull: wherin ye expreste: Cause of credence: in flies honesties: to grow, Much more, then in spiders worshipes: there may showe. Credence, honestie, and worship, thus take I. Credence in this woorde truste: plainly terme we maie Honestie, vertue morally and ciuily. Worship, reuerence, or estimacion to saie. Honour: is also reuerence: as vse doth waie. Honour and worship: both one in vse take we, Saue: honour is reuerence, in the higher degre. Now note: that the full cause of credence or trust, Springth and spreadth out of vertue or honestee. And honour, or worship: is dewly discust, Dew, where vertue or honestie is, then see. Who is not honest, woorshipfull: he can not bee. For: woorship: and honestie: thone and thother. The tone of the twaine, dependth on the tother. What (quoth the flie) meaneth this circumquaquie, This (quoth the spider) where ye (in your laste saiyng,) Seperate in sunder: woorship and honestie, Woorship: to spiders, and honestie: to flies laiyng. Flies credence aboue spiders, tauaunce in waiyng. Woorship: and honestie: I ioine so: that here, Woorshipfull spiders: be honeste spiders clere. Honest spiders are woorshipfull (quoth the flie.) By honestie. And credible to, no naie. But where spiders honestie standeth awrie, Woorship and credence, stande awrie to I saie. So (quoth the spider) be honestie awaie, The flies credit: standth a crooke euen as far, As the spiders. But let vs touche this case nar. Graunt: hers a spider of honestie no whit, To whom: admit a flie of great honestee. The spider (not the flie) to auctoritee knit. Is not that spider: in auctorised degree, More woorshipfull and credible taken to bee, Then that inferior flie? (quoth the flie no. Which ye shall here, but first here how your woordes go. Credence. honor. woorship, or reuerence, To vertue or honestie, ye first auoucht due. Laste, auctoritee ye bringe in assistence. Thunhonest auctorised, therby tensue, In woorship and credence. Ye (quoth he that? true. And in touching that first of these two cases, I forgat this laste, but both must haue their plases. As honor, or woorship, and credence do depend, Upon all that are honest: by honestee, So woorship and credence: in lyke case to bend, On all in auctoritee, by auctoritee. Naie (quoth the flie) (quoth the spider) friende tell mee, Is not auctoritee, to be woorshippid? Yes maister (quoth the flie) or els god forbid. All auctoritee: not against the great god, In spiders vnder him plaste: as potentates: In them and their substitutes, that god hath bod: To be woorshipt and obeide, in humble rates. But auctoritee: and auctorised states, Cause of woorship due to both. differ as far, As Ierico and Iersei, in ioining iar. Auctoritee, for it selfe, woorshippid is. Thauctorised, for good vse of auctoritee, Are duely reuerenst, which good vse if thei mis. Woorship or reuerence, to them geuen none should bee. Yet there is (quoth the spider) we daily see. Before thauctorised: curtsy made as low, To the ill as to the good, and more low sum trow. That curtsy (quoth the flie (rightly directed, Runth to thauctoritee: in the auctorisid. Not the auctorised person, respected: Thauctoritie in the person: here reuerensid. Thauctoritie for the person, not woorshippid, Nor the person for him selfe: lacking honestie, Because he lackth honest vse of auctoritie. Spiders in auctoritie: without honestie, No woorship in them selues (I saie) is tauouche: Flies in honestie, without auctoritie: By that honestie, woorship in them selues doth couche, And credence in both these partes: is tride by like touche, Thus vnhonest spiders: being auctorised, Be: (for them selues) woorshiped, nor credited, Beet (quoth the spider) but then to this put cace One spider: and one flie, of one honestie are. Thonest spider plaste: in auctorised place, Thonest flie not. Doth not that spiders state declare, More woorship and credit: then that flie can compare? More woorship? yes: but more credence, no saie I, Profe wherof ensueth, (quoth the fly) by and by. Honestie (I saie as your selfe erste here saide.) Is the roote: that credence and woorship: both twaine: Grow on. So that our woorship and credence waide, On woorshipfull auctoritee, do not remaine. But on our honest vse therof: thus our chaine That lingth vs to credence: is not auctoritie, But good vse of auctoritie: by honestie. Wherin I conclude: flies of moste base degree: Hauing lyke honestie: to spiders moste hie, Haue in lyke wise: lyke credence of equitee. Not lyke reuerent woorship (I saie) for whie, Spiders vsing auctoritee honestlie, For place and person both: where case so ensuse, Flies: to spiders, humble reuerence must vse. What is (quoth the spider) the diffrence in show, Of one degre of credence: in these two tolde? This (quoth the flie.) By this exsaumple to know. Two spiders webs wouen: admit here to be solde. For stuffe and all thinge, both as one to beholde. Saue thone: aboue thother, more faire glosse doth beare. More plesant to the eie, both one to the weare. Yet hath that glossy web estimacion more Then thother though both web? of one weauing bee And so for one credence: in the two before Spiders auctoritee: vsed with honestee Thei shine: in bewtie: of a dowble degree. So that though credence selfe, be one in these both, Yet that glosse in that one, that other out goth. Then (quoth the spider) it serueth for sumwhat, Honest spiders: in auctoritee to stande: Aboue honest flies, ye: but it serueth nat: (Quoth the flie) for your parte of the pointe in hande, To proue more credence, in honest spiders scande: Then in honest flies: for in equall honestee Standeth equall credits, on both sides: ye see. Whiche: you (my maisters) hauing seene; beeing wise, And that: which parte hath credence more: whiche hath lesse, Of spiders or flies: is the thing to deuise, We praie you: your iudgement therin to expresse. If we (quoth tharbiters) in this case adresse, Our selues to geue iudgement: will ye that abide? Ye ye (in pilates voice) all on both sides cride. Let them all (to the butterflie saide the ant) Departe. while we herein seke an ende to finde. Contente (quoth the butterflie) at your instant: Trudge hence ye flies (quoth he) as ye are asinde. At winke of the ant: awaie the spiders winde. Thei all herevpon being gon foorth foorthwith, Thei two: herein proceded as folowith. By thant? prouocacion the butterflie repeteth thargument before made, in his grose termes, not fer from full and thei twaine seeming to agre vpon the point herein, thei c?maunde the spiders and flies backe againe. Cap. 39. VVill ye (quoth the ant) repete vs this talke last? I woulde: but I will not (quoth the butterflie) For I can not: though my harte for it should brast. I forbad here: all spouting in souostrie. Now thei speut: in speuting who may speut most hie Saue now a woorde and tan a woorde: here and tere, Uengeance the whit, I am for their woordes the nere. Tell (quoth the ant) as ye perceiue euen in grose: What the pith is. As I (quoth he) had a glance, Beginning of their comnicashin arose, Wherin thei argde: and fell at arging stance, In comparson, who should haue most credance: Of spiders or flies. The flie. flies honest rate, Tooke more credable, than spiders woorshipfull state. The spider: then cast a compas rownde about, That honestnes, is vertousnes, and woorshipfulnes, Due where honestnes: or vertusnes, bearth rout. So that woorshipfulnes: and honestnes, Do pende ech on other, by that spiders ges. Of spiders and flies: by his almashin gest, Honest are woorshipfull, woorshipfull are honest. The flie to this: said spiders: by honestie, Be woorshipfull and credible to. And than, The spider brought in: a toy of toritie. Thunhonest spider therin: therby to scan, In credance and woorship: eche where and whan, More: then the flie: he being an honest one: Hauing to that honestie, toritee none, The flie to this: for worship and credance: saide, Though toritee for it selfe: woorshipfull bee, Yet winth it no woorship (in any wighte laide:) To him selfe: for him selfe, outsepted that hee: Use therin vsashin of saide honestee. But in misuse of toritee: the flie tolde, Woorship or credance: no wight selfe can holde. Then the spider legde, one spider: and flie one: Thei both, in one gree: of honestie beeing. That spider in toritee, that flie in none. Whether woorship: and credance were not greeing: More to that spider: then to that flie fleeing. More woorship, he graunted: bycause honestee, And toritee ioinde. But more credance, no saide hee. For honestie: and not noritee, is roote, Saide he. Wheron all branches of credance spring. Then no honestie, no credance: had in boote. Lyke honestie, lyke credance: in euery thing. The spider then axte, what diffrance: in shewing: Of one gree of credance: in these fore tolde twaine Whiche by a web saumple, the flie answered plaine. Two spiders webbes of one stuffe and woorkemanship: Saue thone aboue thother hath glosse more gaie: To the eie. but for weare, thei differ not a chip. Yet doth that glossie web: beare the bell awaie, And so the spider: to his honestie in staie: Hauing toritee aboue lyke honest flie, Credance shinth in the spider, more bewteouslie. Well saide (saide the ant) though these termes be but base: Yet aproue thei well: that you perceiue the pith: Which: concerning credence, concludth in this case: That the woorste flie, and the best spider therwith: Where one degree of honestie concurith, There one degre of credence, concurth likewise. Wheron, harke here what a strange case doth arise. Put case a duke of estate honorable. Affirming a tale, on his honour for trew: A duck stepth foorth: and saith it is a fable. Were it not a case (trow you) as strange as new: That dewke: and that duck: of one credite to vew? The dewkes and duck? honestie (quoth he) being one, Their credence is one: by graunted grownde erst gone. From which grownd (maister ant) by my fatherkin. I will not starte, but stande and sticke euen fast: As vnto this my bodie, sticketh this skin: Well (quoth thant) being at this point: with this past, Furder to procede in this case: what way to cast, Let vs haue these spiders: and flies: againe here. At bek of both, all before both did apere. Thant telth them, that where theuidence for both sides goth to one effect, and that in debating whiche side is most credible to awarde the window vnto, it is concluded, that credence standth vppon honestie: and that as all spiders and flies are honest, so are thei credible: now must it first be tride, whiche side is most honest, theron to iudge whiche side is moste credible. Cap. 40. At your last standing here, (? thant) the case stood: On triall in credence: of spiders and flise. Theuidence for both: being one: and lyke good, On which part of both, most credence might arise. Wherin determinate triall to deuise, One cowple of you: one spider and one flie, Reasoned (birlakin) pretily wittily. Brefe pith, wherof (to present purpose,) was this. Honestie ye agrede: of credence is the grownd. Concluding for all: as ech wightes honestie is More or les, so more or les credence: is bownde. All spiders and flies, of one honestie fownde, Are of one credence. In that credence doth bende, All wholly vpon honestie to depende. Then: as theuidence: on which side to ley best: Where credence lith most, we thought best to haue tride, So must we now, for credence: see sum wei gest: Which side bringth most honestie testifide, And therby most credit. To this, or that side. Beit (quoth the butterflie) now let vs see surs: Who shall here win boote, in winning here his spurs. Another spider and flie, to the helme stood. A cumly cowple: as were of these two kinds, Their maner showd their bringing vp? to be good, Curtsy low: to tharbiters, as curtsy binds. Behauir most desent: in vttring their minds: As their talke was: of honestie: to deuise, So deuised thei their talke, honestly likewise. One spider and one flie resoning which side is most honest, agreing in conclusion, that thonestie on both sides apeereth to them two, to be one, that flie requireth tharbiters to ponder the case as thei shall thinke good. Cap. 41. To speake (quoth this spider) trewth honestly here, Brefely: in honestie: both part? to compare, Equalitee doth therin: to me apere. As right many spiders: right honest there are, So right many flies: right honestie declare. As honestie (it selfe) is one qualitee, So both parts qualifide lyke, lyke honest bee. Sir (saide this flie) this is of you qualifide, Right honestly. Whervpon (with your assent, (Under reformacion) I wolde se here tride, One thing: herein to try: what diffrent extent, Standth in one degre, of honestie here ment. In both vs foresaide partise, spiders and flise. Which: in few woordes, I shall now to you deuise. Flies: mo then spiders, twenty to one there are. But then in eche one person, lyke honestee: In one spider, and ten flies: to compare. Showth not here: that most nomber: in quantitee, To show here: the most show of that qualitee? It showth most (quoth the spider) and to show how, Marke this shorte example that I shall show you. One flowre: before two mirrours: being set here. Thone mirrour crakt: in ten peres sundry: Thother whole. This flowre in these glasses shall apere, At the whole glasse, as it is: one flowre only, The crakt glas, showth ten flowrs aparently. For of those ten peeces of glasse euerychone, Ech one peece, (in it selfe) showth one flowre alone. So: this feire flowre honestie: in one spider plaste: And ten flies, eche one posessed of lyke fame. For honestie selfe, there is no more purchaste: In the ten flies, then in thone spider to name. The only diffrence (I say) in show doth frame: Ten flowrs in the crackte glas: as thus to respekt: Ten flowrs in forme, and one flowr in effect. That whole glasse doth show one flowr: and is no mo: That crackte glasse: making show of flowrs: halfe a score Thers yet but one flowr, at both these glasses lo. As in both these parts, one honestie: no more. Well (quoth the flie) yet as I haue saide before: One honestie: in one spider, and in ten flise. Most show of that honestie: in those flise rise. Which show showth (thonestie in all being one) A bewty: shining of more exelensy: In those ten flies, then in thone spider alone. Sir (said the spider) to speake indiffrently, Euen so take it I: and euen so graunt it I. My masters (to tharbiters) the flie then seide, Wey you: how honestie: is here to be weide. Tharbiters commaunding all to go aparte againe, thei fall in talkyng somwhat at large touching both credence and honestie in both these sides, which doone to shew therin their mindes, thei call all before them againe. Cap. 42. Tharbiters: willing both part? to step backe streight, Brother butterflie (said the ant) here ye se: Honestie on both these part?: to peise in weight, If mo honest flies then honest spiders be: Yet of both part?: eche one lyke of honeste, The nombre more and les: as these two declare, Both numbers: of one honestie, thei compare. For thonestnes selfe, (quoth he) to that thei grew. But thonestnes in those flies: shewth more exalent: As twenty flowrs in the broken glasse: to vew: Show of thone flowre in the whole glas: far out went Ye, in show (quoth thant) with you I do consent. But by their equall degree of that qualitee, This spider, and these flies, equally honest bee. Well then good maister ant (quoth the butterflie, We gre: that the show, of one honestnes here: Upon the ten flies parte: showth more shininglie: Then on the one spiders side: in show can pere. And for thonestie selfe, to draw to ende nere, You answering one demaunde: demaunded by me, Best part to sprinspall purpose, we shall soone se. Is not this argnicashin of honestnes, To se who are most honest, spiders or flies? To try therby the side most credabill to ges, In thone euidence: that both sides did deuise, Eche side for it selfe? yes (quoth thant that none deuise. But graunth it. Since (quoth the butterflie) that? trowth, Harke what proofe to purpose: vpon this case growth. Let vs here demit: one spider and ten flise. All lyke honest: who seing two sew at law, That one spider, for thone side, a witnes lise, Those ten flise, to thother side: witnesses draw. I neuer wist wight: that euer herde or saw: But such ten flies euidance: more credably weide, Then such one spiders euidance weide in eide. Not so (quoth thant) for put case this foresaide sorte: In witnessing one woorde: in one tale erst told: To them all: thone spider doth after reporte, That woorde was there and then saide. And flies hold, It was not said: in this case knowth yong and old: This one spider must haue in th' afirmatiue, More credit then ten flies in the negatiue. Maister ant: Flies want of credance: standth not here, In the weakenes of credance in the flise, But in weakenes of credance in the case clere. Negentiue, against firmentiue, weakely lise. Forgetting, and remembring, thus this case trise: We mai soner forget: that we herde last day, Then remember that we harde not, any way. But for both parts here: put afirmentiue case. This one spider affarmth here: firmentiuely. That I lay (last night) in Northumberland place. These ten flies saie: in Westmurland place lay I. In this affarmashin: deemashin to try, Which part hath here: most credance in your deming? The flies (quoth the ant) aparently seming. But since honestie and not credence: is now, The thing: to towch here in place and case present, And that (for thonestie selfe,) I proue to yow: One degree of honestie: in both sides bent, That one: and those ten: haue one honest extent. Agre we for that part: thus to resolue. Which resolucion, let me to them reuolue. Beit (quoth he) but when talke of credance cumth in, Ile arg as I did now: for credance againe. Do (quoth thant) if ye se therby ought to win, All oft erst cald, thei cald again to them twaine. To whom the ant (as aptly did apertaine.) In woordes: for the matter brefly coucht and cast, Pronounst to all, what thei two there passed last. Thant telth them, that thei two determine honestie on both sides to be one. Willing them to go foorth in the mattier, wher with one tart taunting spider, and one sharpe saucy fly, forbearing till this time (with much peine) speaking or rather railing, stande now foorth (vpon tip toes) to chop logike ech with other in rude reasoning of this case. Cap. 43. Of spiders and flies: which parte is most honest, The triall: is the thing: we now stand vpon. Wherin: for flies, one: his opinion exprest. That as flies in nomber are twenty to one: Aboue spiders, all on both sides euerychone: Being like honest, most honestie doth rise, To the flies parte: where the most nombre lise. To this one spiders tale: of the two glasses toucht, Thexample showing more show of honestee: In the more: then in the les nomber auoucht, Yet both parts being honest in one degree, Both partes of lyke honestie, thei toke to bee. And so to adiudge: we two hauing agrede, Agre you: how herein furder to procede. With this, before all these spiders and flies here flockt, Up stoode and out start: that cowple of hare breins: The spider and fly, that erst there bragde and cockt. Upon both their forheds: so swelled the veins: That their thus long silence: was sene their great peins, In cockyng currish countenance: nowhit to seke, Staring ech on other, thei stode cheke to cheke. Auctoritee thei toke, none was to them geeuin, Of good maner voide: in taunting smarte smatrers. Plainnes: without honestie, thei vsed eeuin. Thei both: to side against side, weare no flatrers: But lyke Iaise: in cheritrese such chatrers, That being now bent to chat, their toonges to stop, With an axe: as soone: their heds of, ye may chop. Their talke, whether to repete or to represse. Rude railyng therin, brought me sumwhat to dout. But finally, vpon my show to professe: The show of this matter: thus fer gone about, I thought it meete: to show the show throughout. Namely the case framed no more fer nor by: Then of a poore spider, and a more poore fly. These all (I say) standing before these two set, Both bending their browse: in case rehersed erst, This formost spider and flie: in furius fret, Frowning ech on other, this prosesse thei perst, And vengeable venumly, ech other verst. Before thei cam to end, how beit thei began, In cownterfet coldnes: this matter to skan. Where an other spider and flie reasoned late before to proue which side of both is most honest, this saide quareling spider and cockyng flie, labour to proue which parte of boch is most dishonest, in woordes and dedes. as vsurpacion in windowes and other misbehauiour. at ende wherof in furious fumes, thence renth the spider one waie, and the flie flingth an other. Cap. 44. Maisters (quoth the spider) without circumstance: At reasoning on which parte most honestie lise: Of spiders or of flies, in continuance, Your iudgement: both part? of lyke honestie trise. Which honestie so tride, now contrariwise. For a pithy purpose: let vs here now see, On which side of both: lyth most dishonestee. Dishonestie: dare ye stir that, (quoth this fly?) What dishonestie know you by flies sur? More then flies know by spiders. Flie what know I? Woord? and dedes. Such and so many will I stur, As shall: by dishonestie, flies honestie blur. And first for woordes, honestie: honestly to scan, Honestie speakth well. Ye (quoth the flie what than? This than (quoth the spider) take flies ten thowsande: Where so euer thei flee, go, stand, lie, or sit. Few of the nomber haue taken vpon hande: To geue any good spider any good woorde yeet, Except in flattery: which woords show euery whit: As much dishonestie: in fals feire semblance, As showth in fury, fowle woordes of more greuance. When flies flockt togither, vpon their ale benche Begin to hizs or bizs, in their kind of talke, No lordes, no lawse, can their bizsing bable quenche. And so many woordes, so many lies: still walke. If one diuell with an other: for lies should calke: Thei could neuer finde the like, oh (quoth the flie: Your maistership talkth wonderfoole honestlie. If ye gaue eare to your selfe, ye might soone know: Spider or flie: who speakth most ill of vs twaine. Speake not spiders as ill of flies: as ye trow, As flies speake of spiders? yes it shouth to plaine. Wherin these termes must we vse: vpon great paine. When either of other part: talke out of measure, The knaue fly railth. Maister spider speakth his pleasure. But graunt: dishonest woordes ech part of other, Do speake a like much: which showth like dishonestee, In both these parts: the tone parte to the tother. Of flies dishonest woords, the cause is to see: The dishonest deedes, of you spiders to bee. Example wherof: to proue this case most clere, Doth in this window (for all windowes) apere. All holes wherin: being ours in comon right. Late comonly ours, now seuerally yours. Looke where ye set in foote, by right or by might, Lyke as the diuell saith: so sai you: all is ours. For: as this window showth your vsurped pours: So: in all windowes where so euer ye cum, Ye graspe vp all: and flies mai sai nought: but mum. Thus when we speake (I say) if our spech ill be, Of your ill deedes: cum our ill woordes: euerychone. Do you none ill deedes: to vs good sir (quoth he?) Yes sir (quoth the flie) flies to spiders do one, In our curtsy made to you: downe to grownd gone: Most sinfully we commit idolatry. For we therin, woorship false imagery. Fals imagery (quoth he?) ye are a fals knaue. A right liuerey (quoth he) turnde on the wrong side. But liuerey and wages: that spiders vouchsaue: To geue flies, of one substance are verifide. Knaue vp: or take vp flie: thy wandring woordes wide. Truly to try: how truth the touch stone may touch, On whose side: most dishonestie, is tauouch. All dishonest woordes: in flies of spiders had, Cum of dishonest deedes: in spiders to flise. Thus saist thou, which saiyng showth thee drunke or mad, What ill or wrong deedes: do we to you deuise? Our owne windowes to vse, as our owne will aplise. Your dedes were not ill: were all windowes your own, But no woordes: saue your own, show windowes so known. The tops: and top sides: of all windowes all yours: We haue graunted and wold graunt: weare ye content, To graunt likewise all holes in all windowes ours, But spiders must haue all, ye may nought relent, And in your hauing all: marke thexperiment. How the worlde before went, and since how it goth: (For comon welth) in spiders: and in flies both. When you in toppes and sides there: kept your estate: And we in the holes: as stood with our degre, Spiders and flies: in all windowes situate, Dweld ech by other in welth and vnite. But since (lyke a sorte of rake hels as ye be) Ye lifte ech at other: and all at vs lifte, There is in you, nor vs: either loue or thrifte. But you: we: and our windowes to: all go to wracke. By you couetous cutthrotes: the diuell choke ye. Wilt thou wrech (quoth he) ley all this on our backe? Growne by our striues, nay flie and flies: Ile yoke ye: With more then halfe part of the ill: to smoke ye. It is and hath ben said: thers no good accorde: In place, where as euery knaue will be a lorde. Which is terbox to your side: for out of dout, Your cockapert pride: and your couetous harts. Haue brought: more then three parts of our ils about. Your rude rebelins disobedient parts: Much vnto our (and much more to your own) smarts: Kicking and wincing at euery good order, Hath distroide good order in euery border. Good order: lost by pride and couetousnes, In graunt, but how: lost by vs? nay lost by yow, Flies may be couetous, but as for riches: Flies get none: Except here and there one talow: Yes (quoth the spider) many flies are rich now: In occupiyng in windowes vnder vs, By price of things reisde there: in fowle ouerplus. Where flies: of spiders (by wrong quoth he) are dryuen: To hyre our owne: kept from vs (we saie) by might. Fines incums: and rents, so great and many gyuen, With such streight restreint: of our accustomd right, That one of those or all, eat vp our geins quight. Which exacte exactions: in spiders began, Ere flies in sale of any wares, from thold rate ran. As I am trew ientilman, thou liste on vs. As ye are a trew ientilman: euen so I ly. But as ye are a fals ientil manto discus, Your falshod and my truth, may ioine iolily. Ile proue streight (quoth the spider) that thou lyest, I, For rent?: and warse reisde, thou saist spiders begoon. But marke how vnhonestly that ly doth roon. Fiue foote to two: in windowes of this reme: Ye flies hold yet, in lease at vnreised rent. All holders wherof: sell their wares: as extreme, As though their fermes at the most reised rent went. Now who beginth here: the first extort extent? The flies (quoth the flie) but yet spiders begun: To reise rent? before: as leases did out run. And as leases fall still, so reise thei rent still. And still (of their goodnes) will reise: I dout not. In new leases: of such couenant? to fulfill, As the flies geins: no great priui tithes shall lot. The lewd lords: their landlords: in reckning the shot, The lot of alowance: in both parts to ley, The spiders haue the creme, the flies haue the whey. But spiders: letting farms, and flies holding farms. Thone letting farms hie, thother selling vitels dere. And of all ware sellers: ech shifteth from harms. By reising his ware, as other wares apere. But all that on their pencions (or pence) liue mere: In windowes: without lande to let, or ware to sell, Where euer thei dwell: mai thinke thei dwell in hell. Well (quoth the spider) for leases not run out, Flie fermers holding fermes yet: as olde rent gaue, Why raise thei their wares: with thother polling rout? Thei take time (quoth the flie) while thei the time haue. For when your time cumth, you will so polle and shaue: By reised rentes: turning hed fermers to heardes. That thei know: ye will flit the fat from their beardes. And ye hie hed spiders: in a conspiracie: Conspire in all windowes, to kepe fermes at heith. Or kepe them in your own handes, to kepe thing? hie: Where a flie (quoth the spider) doble rent peith: More than he hath paide. There experience seith: Looke what wares: at what price: that flies solde before, Those or worse wares he selth for treble price more. So that if spiders reise rent?, two poundes from one. Three pounds fr? one: at lest flies reise their wares streight Their which robry, hering any rumor vpone, Of the faute, on vs spiders thei ley the weight Roring: in raging: how we our land? do height: Making them begers (when thei with that thei win, Are able to purchase the fermes thei dwell in. Well lide: well saide: (said the flie) I wold haue saide. But now to our ground: on which our saiyng arose. For dishonestie, on both part? to be leide. Couetous and pride: being chefe grownds in grose: To proue on which part: most dishonestie gose, Dishonestie by couetusnes doth rise, At the least: as much in spiders as in flise. And as much in flies, as in spiders say I, But what remedie flie: to remoue this grefe? Looke thei that list: thei shall for me (quoth the flie) We talke not now of grefe: to deuise relefe, By honestie, but by dishonest mischefe: To charge which parte most dishonest we can ges In all ils, namely pride and couetusnes. Wherin: as we in couetusnes haue saide, Let vs now: ech part apose other in pride. The which vice for both our sides vprightly weide, Dishonestie therin, shalbe verifide. To lie altogither, on the spiders side. Spiders, are of flies: alway curtsy takers: And flies to spiders, alway curtsy makers. And yet (I say) in bending our knees to ball: Flies looking like lams: spiders lyke lions looke. As though poore flies, were made for rich spiders all. Of which: though foolish flies: the suffrance may brooke: Wise flies can not brooke it: for thei finde in booke: This demaund written. When Adam dolue and Eue span, Who was in those golden daies, a gentleman. None as who saie. And were there none now (say wee) The worlde shuld be as good now, as it was then. If yemen flies: were put in autoritee, We wold rule as well, as spiders gentlemen: Shall Iak sauce rule now flie? sir by these bones ten: We shall sure be rulde: in all kinds of lawse, As well by Iak sause: as by maister Iohn dawse, What wit: or what welth: winneth your estate stout, Looke hily: speake lordly: commaunde all, and do nought. Gai geare, goodly copwebs: to reuell with the rout, Without any housholdes. For the poore flies wrought. But with disshes deinty: fer fet and dere bought. One fat spider: an other feedth in fine feast: More to set out him selfe, then to feast his geast, These prowd peacoks propertise: wholly remaine, In you prowde spiders. And not in vs poore flise, But most prowde, most foole. As flies prouerbes conteine. Flies (quoth the spider) in their prowde exercise, Are to fer vnlike lords: lords lookes tenterprise. Lordlyke to looke, flies countenance can not brooke: Bu though flies looke not lordlyke: knaue like thei looke: Shall we not finde a knaue flie: not worth two strawse: Looke more prowdly, the the best lord in a shere? Yes. And take vpon him in chop logik lawse: To controll vs, and our housholds fer and nere. So that by pride, les dishonestie showth here: In lordly looks: of spiders lordlike brauery, Then in flies knauish deeds, by knauelyke knauery. Of which sorte of sause malapert minions, Thou art captaine caitif: against vs to kicke. And sure: thou holdst perillous opinions. Weare thou aposed pithily to the quicke, I durst ley my life, thou art an hereticke. I defie (quoth the flie) the wrech that so seith. Harke: I will euin in your eare: confesse my feith. The flie: blowing a while, in the spiders eare: The spider: that while: brething in the flies necke, Both cride out, as thei had ben stoong on a speare. I am kilde (quoth the spider) death cumth at becke. This flie hath blown fliblowse in mine eare a pecke. I am poisond (quoth the flie, deth rydth in the rode. This spiders breth, makth me swell lyke a tode. Triacle cride thone, an eare pyke: cride thother. The flie flew, the spider crept, quight out of sight. The flie flang one waie: the spider ran an other. Fewme of firy fury, in both was sene right. But both being anone gone out of sight quight, Thant: in reproch of their communicacion, Told them all, part of his imaginacion. After a few woordes, which thant speakth to the rest of both sortes there, thei are assigned to stande backe againe, while tharbiters gather out of this railyng, such reason as thei can. Cap. 45. It is comonly said, and comonly sene. Where as any nomber: of any sort be: Of all sortes there be, and euermore haue bene. And as in most base sort: sum right good we se, So in the best sort: as ill to decre. Example wherof: no better profe ensurth, In no one example, then this one procurth. Of you: both sortes spiders and flies: present here: You vse your selues honestly. Many and moste, But yet therto se we: that here doth apere, On ech one side: one so brimly brag and boste, That thei proue on both sides: sum knaues in the coste: I meane these twaine gone. Whom vpon inquering, Are: in honest audience, not worth the hering. Forsoth (said a sober spider) euen in deede: Thei are vnwoorthy hering: in any place. Trew (quoth a wise flie) but since it was agreede: By comon counsels on both sides: to purchase: Or prouide: them to ioine with vs in this case, It semeth vnsemely for vs to reiect: Such: as our electors to vs haue elect, It semth so (said the ant) and I take it so. Brother butterflie: will ye that thei depart: While we twaine, to groping of this matter go. Ye maister ant (quoth he) with all my hart. Thei all (once againe) from them twaine reuart. While thei two deuise: sum way of availing, To gather right reason, out of rude railing. Tharbiters consider in this taunting talke, that sondry dishonest abvses there are in sondry parties on both sides. vpon their agrement of conclusion wherin, thei haue before them those other spiders and flies againe. Cap. 46. To pas this last case (quoth thant) as in award, Which part is most dishonest, the case erst weid: Resoning which is most honest part: to regard: Is a plaine plat: to proue this likekise leid. As honestie there is: equally displeid, To show the tone part: as honest as the tother, So show both here, like dishonest: thone and thother. What kinds of fauts: we mai in the spiders find, The same (or the like) we mai find in the flise. So that (I say) as equitee hath asinde, One degre of dishonestie, in both lise. Where our former talke (quoth the butterflie) trise: Thonestie one: in both the sides: yet ye know: That honestie in the flies, shinth most in show. For that (which I told you I wold in mind bere) Flies: fer mo in nomber, then spiders apere. Trew (quoth thant) and as most nomber winth flies there, Most show of honestie, so most nomber here: Most show of dishonestie: showth in flies clere. As most nomber of thonest: shine most in fame, Most nomber of dishonest, shine most in shame. Then (quoth the buterflie) as flies here nought get, So loose thei nought: wherin let vs be content: To set the hares head, against the goose ieblet. Both sides: to adiudge lyke honest: I assent. And I (quoth the ant) do geue the same iudgement, Herevpon thei cald all again to stand nere, To whom wherin, thant declard as ensuth here. Thant declarth to those spiders &amp; flies, that the tales of the pearte spider and flie before tolde, do charge ech others part in such sort, that thei can not sai which side is most dishonest: but thei two adiudge clerely in dishonest thinges: both sides of lyke dishonestie. wherwith thei al auoided backe again, tharbiters talke to fal to a point betwene them selues what report finally and fully to make. Cap. 47. Although the railyng of those railers late gone: For it selfe: or them selues, vnmeete may be thought. Either to be talkt vpon: or thought vpon. Yet since the matter of their talke: such talke brought: That as one ground of our talke, talke hath it wrought, We haue wrought therto: conciderate consent, To conclude therin, this extended extent. Dishonestie in spiders and in flies both, Apereth aproued: so indiffrently, That on which side the most dishonestie goth: We can not know: nor other wise verify, But like dishonestie, on both sides doth ly. So that out of hande: to declare our decre, Both parts: in dishonestie, haue one degre. But for as much: as dishonestie here toucht: Was: to proue or disproue honestie before: Which part of both: most or least honestie auoucht, And that dishonestie: doth deside no more: Then honestie did, leaue dishonesties lore. And by former talke: in honestie alone, Take honestie on both parts here, iudged one. The graue nombre on both sides agrede to this Whervpon: thant axt who had furder to sey: Concerning euidence: in the premissis. Thei all saide: thei had to say no fuder, they, Well said thei both: ye all yet again awey. Which done, thei both: ech to other their mindes brake, What end (now at end) thei finally might take, Tharbiters being agreed on their report, thei call to them againe the spiders and the flies. Cap. 48. Brother butterflie (quoth thant) how thinke ye now? What makth all this euidence for either side? All alich for both (quoth he) now how say you? I sei the same (quoth thant) wherin is specifide, To hard a triall: to iudge the best side tride. The best side of both: since doute hath thus drownd it, Let? at last, leaue it, as we at first found it. Agrede (quoth the butterflie) by my good sooth: Thei herewith cald againe, the spiders and flise. Ech hoping to here a tale, for his own tooth. But thant being (for an ant) lerned and wise: Otherwise weiyng, otherwise did deuise. Of this proces past, where to report the pith. For which (vnto them all,) he made wei forthwith. Thant shewth them, that the butterflie and he are at point what to reporte, deuising it to be reported before the head spider and the flie in the copweb the two principall parties, and to haue with them to here and witnes their reporte, two spiders and two flies: witty and discrete. and the rest to staie there till their returne. Which being agreed, thei set foorth streight to the said copweb. Cap. 49. Know ye all: that we two being full agreede: What we shall say, we must now full agre: Where we shall say. Which saiyng must be decreede, Before those two: that did vs two decre, As friendes of trust: in this autorite. The spider and flie (meane I) which two are, Chefe grownds in the case, that we must now declare. The butterflie: and all the rest there: seide. For that report, that was the place most fit. Let vs, with vs, (quoth thant) haue forth in eide, Two spiders and two flies: of credence and wit. And all the rest, till our returne here to sit. Thei two with the two twose: folowing in order, Past on: till thei cam to the copwebs border. The flie in copweb stoode vp, and praier lefte. Longing for meede: of preier preide ere than, With deadly looke: as death had lyfe berefte. But when the spider: into place cam than, Alas poore flie: how he lookte pale and wan. All those without: vnto the spider within, At their low curtsy done, thant did thus begin. The ant associate with the saide sort pronounceth at length (to the spider and flie in the copweb) this brief effect, that in as much as on both sides the euidence is one, and that the credence is one, by thonestie being one, they two can (in reason) no waie trie, howe to ley thaccustomed right more on thone side then on thother: they finallie leaue the case euin at libertie, as they founde it: and so departe to the place of abitrement againe. Cap. 50. My great good vncle, and litle good friend: flie. Where you two: chose vs two: your arbytres late, To adiudge (by reason) the custome rightlie: Of spiders and flies, in all windowes situate, Which part should haue all: or what part we should rate: To eyther part, what hath theron risin sith, And what in fine for fine doth rise, here the pith. In the first talke betwene you tweyne: and vs tweine, Thissew to try was (as ye sayde vnto vs,) How right in all windowes (I sey) doth remaine, To both sides, as reason may custome discus. You: for you and all spiders, a leging thus. All parts in all windowes (none except) sayde ye, Are yours: and all spiders, as in tenure fre. Wherin you flie, as ye then affirmed) heelde, All holse in all windowes, are flies free of olde. Tops and sides, being spiders hold free: to beelde. Hed houses or tenantrees or what ye woolde. So that for the holse only: is all the holde, which (vpon furder euidence, to consither, We (as ye wyld vs to go,) went to gyther. Where: spiders and flies, a certeyne nombre met. Before a pointed: euidence to disclose. And first for all spiders, one to vs there set, Sayde. As report of spiders: hath gone and gose. All holse in all windowes: are theirs to dispose. The flies then cald, one flie for all verifide, All holse: by all flies woordes long to flies side. These two: in their two tales: showing diffrence none, In matter: nor in woordes, saue onely that thei: Leid the same: ech on the side: he stanth vpone, Thei both: and thei all: strangers to vs (to sey, This one sentence: on which of both sides to ley, Both showing a lyke credible, to vs too, That was thing difficult: for vs two to doo. Whervpon: both part? (before vs both) cald we. To try on which part, most credence might apere. Wherin one spider: and one flie: of grauitee. Reasoning on which side most credence shuld show here, Thei both: at last graunted this, for a grownde clere. As euery wights count: in honestie doth mount, So euery wights credence: amounth in acount. For: honestie agrede thei, to be the grownd: (Or grownded cause) of credence. Then were we dreuen: To serch on which side, most honestie was fownd. Wherin (on both sides) when all resons were geuen, Thonestie on both sides, in our iudgement was euen. And so: for credence, (hit on honestie growing) One honestie, one credence: in both parts showing. Thus: their euidence being one: wherunto: Their credence one: by being of honestie one, To try the wrong doers: which we cam to do, What wey can we (in reason) take? for sooth none. Wherin lacking power, since our goodwill alone: Can do nought, honestly this charge to discharge, As we this case found here, we leaue here, at large. Friende butterflie (said the spider) how sai you? As maister ant hath said (said he) so sai I. Then (quoth the spider) with thank? to you both now, We both discharge you. Sir (quoth the butterfly) My poore kinsflie here: that in durance doth ly. For charge or discharge: in euery condeshin, I besech your maship handle him with screshin. I will (quoth the spider) vse him no warse. Then standth with reason, law, custom, and conscience: If (quoth the flie) those graunted grownds not reuarse. As: till I se them reuerst, in experience: I see no cause: to conceiue lack of credence, Then shall I (and all flies) lawde your equite. Undoutfull trust wherof, much comforteth me. Feare not that flie (quoth he) and the flie (of trowth) From dangerous dred: that he drooped in eare, Hoppeth now in hope: as all outward show showth. But yet for all thoutward brag: that he did beare: Me thought he semde inwardly, not without feare: Least faire feithfull promise of present plesance, Might haue fowle feithles displesant performance. But betwene hope and drede, he lying there still, Thant: and butterflie: the fowre spiders and flise, Tooke leaue and departed. The same place vntill, That thei last cam fro. Where their company life. To repete their doing, in this comprimise. The spider in copweb, gone that to declare, In thuper part of his howse, where his flok are. Thant and butterflie set where they had sit, thant repeteth to those spiders and flies the report made by him at the sayde copweb, at end wherof the spiders and flies, seeing that time spent all in vayne, eche side amonge them selfes fall in mourmuring. Cap. 51. Thant and butterflie: set where they erst had sit, Those spiders &amp; flies: st?ding where they erst stood Thant repeting this, they perceyuing in it: Much time spent on all parts: and no part take good, They began generallie: to change their mood. The spiders, to gither clustring and cluttring, The flies, togither in murmering muttring. Upon the spiders and the flies mutring murmering, sodenlie there cum nie aboute them: a wonderfull nombre of all manner of flies: in theyr warlike manner. Wherat with twynke of an iye (as it were) the head spider (with a greate nombre of spiders,) hath builded a strong castell in that copweb. With ordinaunce and weapons and spiders redie in order of defence. Cap. 52 Herewith (euin sodenlie: at twink of an iye,) Cam such a flight of flies: in scattred ray, As shadowed the sonne: from thearth to the skie. No kind of flie a liue, but was there that day. Tag and rag, like lions: raging now rage thay. Fleshflies, butterflies, land flies, water flies. Bees, humblebees, waspes, hornets, gnats of all sies. The graund Captaine, standing: amid mong this rought, Was the flie, that flange from thence in fewrie erst told. Seld hath bene seene such a sort. And all so stought, Except here and there one: temprate to beholde. Staues, bats, clubs, pichforks, most begerlie most bold. Wherwith the spiders that erst gaue euidence, In the copweb, tooke sentuarie for defence. Where: whether this proude spider gaue woord before: Who with that pert flie: had before there prated: Or that spiders: of ordinarie: haue store: Of all municion: for warrs redie rated, I wot not. But without more time delated: Ordnance of all sorts round the copweb was leyde, And all spiders with all weapons, prest in eyde. Daggs, handgoons, hakse, hagbussers, culuerins, slings: Potgoons, sakirs, cannons, double and demie. Feeld peeces, of all sewts, with al belonging things. Byls, bowes, partisance, pikes, to push fer or nie, And to occupy all, spiders plaste aptlie. Ech of them: harnest meete for his properte, The rest, all in bright harnesse capa pe. The flies, of all ordnance were not destitute, Nor furnished: like as the spiders weare: Rustie rotten peeces: their terrour to brewte, They shot of, and shot wide, of marks euerie where. Drums, fiffes, flags, and wiflers, none wanted there. Baners displaide on both sides: all arms bearing, In harolds books a vowde, for both sides wearing. The flies, in nomber, a boue the spiders far. The spiders, in order, fer better then thaie. The flies, will aduenture to make or to mar, The spiders, (not sodenlie) sobreli waie: To defend or offend, the flies as they maie. The spiders, in copweb wyll bide this ieobertie. The flies, in feeld wyll beseege them at libertie. This huge heape of flies light aboute tharbiters. Apprehending thant, casting a halter aboute his necke: drawing him to their tree of reformacion (as they call it) to hang him streyght. But at his sute to be hard speake ere he die, on fli fleeth into the tree, wherwith the captaine commaundeth silence. Cap. 53. This innumerable flocke of flies: are now, Marcht vnto tharbiters. And they there lighted, They tooke thant prisoner: with an vnaduised vow, To spight the spiders, who had flies long spyghted, That he should streight be hangd, and then endited. Of felonie: against flies: as an adherent, To spiders, in their vsurpacion vrgent. Hang him vp (quoth one) with wilde woords and wide wit. A fals wretch he is. And well knowne eueri wheare. And wo'd be knowne no where: where euer he flit. He hath two names: one name here, an other theare. In this place cald ant. In that place cald pismeare. And one susspected varlet: two names to haue, Is (in common iudgment,) iudged a false knaue. Then stept forth a sort of fell flies, fewriouslie. Who: hauing cast a halter about thants neck, To their tree of reformacion standing by, They fellie forst him, with manie a chorlish check. A ladder to that tree was set, at a beck. Where he in hast halde vp: and the halter tide, Turne the theefe of the ladder: thousands cride. Small was the maruaill: though thant were much abasht: To se this sore sooden importable chaunce, Who liueth in nature: but he must be dasht: Both out of corage, and out of countenance. That should streyght: be dasht out of continuance. When none (or few) being forewarnd of deaths howre, Can euinlie beare feeling thought, of that sharp showre. Fight now in worship set hie: as a iudge: Euin now, standing in shame to be hangd hie, I owe to him, a feeling greefe of grudge: Unknowne to all: that haue not felinglie: Felt of the same, in their experiensie, His looke and hew now, and late: so vnlike, That to the hart: a iew that sight must strike. In which agonie: calling to him his wit: One wise flie: at all formar talk present, Seming with all flies present in good credit, He preyd to perswade all there: to be content, To here him speak, ere he his life should relent. But reason (quoth that flie) and therwithall, he, To get thant that grace, gat him in to that tre. The flie there bent to speake, the captaine graund, By mouth of an harold: at trompet sownid, In proclamacion, did silence streight commaund. Wherat: a few words here and there in ears rownid, To here that flie speake, their speche was all drownid. Whervpon the captaine bidding that flie say, These or these like few words, he saide streight way. The flie in the tree: to perswarde the flies to here the ant speake, wadeth honestlie, politiklie to a lewre them, to quiet heryng of the ant before they put him to death. His which tale tolde, he remoueth to his place agayne, Cap. 54, Brothers (and brotherlie freends) all: I dout nat: Ye know me a flie: and take me such a flie, As for ant: or spider: in anie what: Wyll not be false, to the flock that naturallie: I ought to be trew vnto: to liue or die: For this ant and all ants: what I shall say now, Shall approue me none of them, but one of you. Of whom: eche one: an other my self to sey. And ech one to other: (I hope,) likewise knit. Let vs all as one: entring this one iourney, Enter the path, as we may pas thorow it. One depe enduction wherto: iuged in my wit, Is to flee rash deedes rashlie done here. For such, Haue vndone all: in our like case, verie much. One of which daungerous deedes (vnder correction,) We do in this deede: thant thus to death to draw. Without accusacion or detection: Wherby might appere anie colour of law: To kill him. This lo doth my conscience gnaw. And yet more: the nombre here in ire so sturd, That they wold haue him hangd, and not speake one wurd. Which deede: if we do, wheare are our like monsturs? First to apprehend an ant vndetected: By any colour, that anie worde consturs. To be eyther detected, or susspected: And not onlie streyght vnto deth, directed: But dy, not suffrid to speake, defame of vs: That perpetuall tromp, will blow: in shame of vs. Wherfor for vs (and not for him) as I seide: I sew to you, as he hath sewde to mee. To here him speake, which speche of you herd and weyde, As you shalbe a grede, so shall I agree. To hang him: or saue him, as we cause shall see. This tale thus told, downe the flie againe flitth, And where he erst did sit, theare he agayne sitth. The flies former fine tale, nowhit sturreth the grose flies to the hearing of the ant. Whervpon the butterflie (that was an arbiter) fleeth into the tree: laboring the flies to haue the ant heard speake ere he die. Cap. 55. VVith this: a chirme in mumering there fell: Amonst them all. They in flocks flocking anone, Here and there a flock: like sort to like. To tell, Theyr minds. And sum preysde sum dispreysde the tale gone This tale showth this fue honest and wise (saith one) He is a false flattring flie (seyth another) He sayd well: but he ment ill (sayde some other) Thant hath bribid him: (quoth one) he is corrupt sewre. An ant bribe a flie (quoth an other) wherwith? With one of his eggs, that is a sore alewre. To tempt a flie, naye quoth one) this is the pith: He is a spie: for the spiders (I se euen sith) I herd no worde (quoth one) to susspect him by. (Quoth one) all his wordes sound susspiciously, So manie heds, so manie witts. There were sene. Thonest flies: that flies tale, honest he did brooke. The contrarie tooke his tale contrarie clene. I herd by sum flies words: and saw by theyr looke. That thill sort: the good sort: against their wils tooke. Good flies wolde haue suffred: and haue sit euin still: Rather then haue risin: by force of thyll, But forth he must (they say) that the deuill doth driue, Thinges are not wrought: by wysdome in such a rout: Will: and not wisdom, must such matters contriue. All suerte of safte, to bring in a dout. Or to set safte vndoubtedlie Quight out, In which safte: such flies: as sat fast before, Must leaue hold: to take hold, on contrarie shore. They being now dreuen, they must do as they shall, And not as they wold, and for this case in hand, Hang the ant forthwith: cride the most nombre all. The blont butterflie: that arbiter had stand, Whipt into the tree: as feerse as a fyre brand. And at silence had: vpon the trompets blast, He must blow his blast. Or els his hart must brast, The butterflie (to get thant to beheard) telth his tale in such rude maner and matter, that anone he setth them all (welnie) together by the eares. But vppon his grose tale grosely tolde, (much more lyked then the flies finer tale) thei graunt to here the ant speake. Cap. 56. VVhat a sort of captayne coblers haue we here: Under our graund capteyne, I charge euerichone: Kepe silence, and obediance all in fere. In the circumsicion that we go vpone, Thinke you: the victorie lith on your hands, not one. Sharmysh ye maie: and like capon cockers cock, But we butterflies must heare bide the shock, And why not we wasps (quoth one) as wel as you: Why not we dors as well as bothe (quoth one dor) Why not flies: and gnats? (quoth one) of ech sort now: Being a hewge heape: exeding all nombor, To ouercum yonder spider senior: As well as fewer great luburs. Mark this mark: The old prouerbe sayth, manie hands make light wark. So light wark theyr light heds, for light hands made: That ech wons light fist was bent to others eare, Sort agayne sort: they anone entred such trade, That I thought they wold all haue gone by thears theare, Til their captaine: with cap in hand, to forbeare: In beseching entreated them. Which heate gone, Let the butterflie speake: they cride euerichone. The butterflie blontlie thus entred agayne. What deuyll flies be you freends be you so hastise? That your freends maie not speake their wils: plat &amp; pleine A deuils name (I saie) your chating toungs chastise. I wene you eate no skins meate but daw pastise. Peace dawpates: while I tell a thing now reiounst, In my head, which to vtter I am compounst. Ye wold haue the ant hangd, before he be hard. For that thinke you most polisie. As scons my dere: Ye maie not here him first: and hang him afterward: But euerie flie thinking him selfe stoode now here, Wheare this ant standth, and at hanging euen as nere, Should it not sting him like stang of an adder? To thinke to be turnd without speech from this ladder. Wyse flies saie: it is sin to lie on the deuill Then here the trouth told, of this present poore ant. Who that can cause him, let him lege the euill. But my soule from sauashin: slide to hell a slant: If he in our bitterment, showd anie want: Of conshinable diffrancie. In his woords dolt: But betwene both parts stood vpright as a bolt. You all: weing this thing in ponderashin, In hering of him what equaltie ye show: And in not hering him: what slaunderashin: To vs all: shall grow, that since ye all do know, Wey it quicklie, and your minds therin out blow. Downe he flew: whervpon the flies saide they wold, Here thant speake And thervpon this tale he told. The ant prayth to be herd speake thorowlie before anie part of his tale be adiudged. And then they to adiudge the whole as standth with equite. First alleginge better to cleare himselfe from offending the flies. Finallie geuinge them (as it semeth) freendli counsell, (touchyng this strife) grounded vpon this common saying: before thou ought begin, haue an iye to the ende, Cap. 57. My masters flies here all in generall: And eche one perticulerlie: I humblie praie, What things I shall touch, generall or speciall: To take to the best. And first that I maie: As remembrauncer of your remembraunce, ley One speciall meane forth here: remembred to be, Drawing herers in all things to equite. And equite, in all things: to giue or to take: (Among other vertues) is a vertew pewre. Inequite, for wrong, no waie can make. Where equite, is set and setled sewre, For equite in no wise may endure: Balance, to anie one side, cast or dreuine. Equite, equallie: kepth the balance euine. Which meane: for which equitÃ© to be obteynde, Is: that herers: in hereing this mi case, Se: that diffinitiue iudgement be refreynd, In anie part therof: to take anie place, Tyll the whole be herd. Which hering to purchase, Is my great sewt. Beseching all to susspende: Iudgement in euerie part: till all parts take ende. First for me: next for you and me: last for you: I sew to be hard. And first for me, marke all. From all offence by me done: to you here now, Syns I cam, in this case that doth here fall, I am clearde. By one vnspect for parshall, I meane that worshipfull maister butterflie: Who trieth me: to haue delt here indiffrentlie. He cleerth me sins I cam. And before I cam, Yf any flie (Iustlie) to my charge can ley: In anie thing waying the weyght of a dram, By worde, or deede: either open or priuey: That euer I hurt flie: anie maner wey, Then let my ponishment here: be so ample, That all ants may therby take an example. But being clere sins I cam: and more tauow: Being clere till I cam: from woorde and deede ill, Alas: why will ye kill me, who hurth not yow. For neuer did hurt you, nor neuer will. For neuer can: though will wold ill fulfill. This: for my selfe leyde, (as for my selfe proued, I hope my selfe sure: from harme by you moued. Secondly: for you and me both, this meane I. Yf ye draw the blood of me: (thus innosent,) As the los is small, so naught wyn ye therby. But (as is saide) infamie of endles extent, Which paine fro me: and shame from you to preuent, The safe salue for both sides: is this to decre, Saue you my life, and that saueth your honeste. Third: and last poynt: nought for me, all for you; Prouyng me, not only: you no whit to hate, But much to loue: a tale Ile tell and a vow, Which: you hering and folowing: in stedie state, Shall stedilie stey you, from harme in debate: That hangth ouer your heds: much more than ye se, Wherin for you and not for me, (I say) here me. Among many presepts philosoficall: Geuen to all persons: to take profet by, For tyme: place: and case present, aboue all. One serueth in sentence most singulerly. The woordes short: the matter long: the reason hy. Which woordes and matter, on these woordes do depende. Ere thou ought begin, haue an eie to the ende. This pure presept: as all oft in woordes sey it: If all did do it, in effectuall deede, So that our deeds did it: as our woords wei it, Oh: what commoditee therby shuld proceede. Our full felicitee: shuld thervpon breede. As contrarily breedth: in contrary show, Infelicitee: as we feelingly know. Who wold begin a fray: and his fo therin kill? If he lookt to thend, that shuld hang him therfore. I wene all the world, shuld be kept from all ill: Kept we this lesson well, in practised lore: To thend of beginning: to looke euermore: Before we begin, for when we haue begoon, The leauing of lightly, is not lightly woon. Small things begun: without looking to their end, Cum oft to ill end: great losse, and ieoperdee. Great things: begoon than: none Iie on thend tatend, At (or ere) their beginning: we must agree: To be our much more discommoditee. As things: greatter and smaller: differ in sise, So diffreth here: discommoditee likewise, And of all our great thyngs: no one of more weyght, Nor therby more meete: thend therin to wey: At beginning, then is that bitter beyght: Of wrechid war. The very locke and key, That lacheth and lockth vs all, from quiet stey. Who that (in rashe roofe) beginneth to contende, He repenth beginning, ere he cum to ende. It is a thing: right far be yond an ants reche: To blase the plat of poyson: generaly: Set a broche by war, but short sum to feche: Warres harme: and good, stand bothe vnspeakably. Both are (I say) vnspeable for why, War hath done more harme: then tale of toung can holde, War hath done no good, and nought can not be tolde. War hath wrought such wo: that all flies comunly, And spyders eke. Of which two sortes I speake: Hauing in all times had experiensy, Of rashe beginning of war: the peace to breake, They seeing (in their war) their winning weake, Wolde leese half the good they had: to peace to fall: Rather then ieberd in war: goods life and all, And of both sortes in this case, weried in war, Flies haue had euer cause: to mislike war moste. When spiders and flies: haue falne at this lyke iar, For quarels: wherin flies, might most their ryght boste: Who euer had the right, the flies the feeld loste. To one score spyders sleyne, flies slayne, twentyscore. And much of their ofspring, lost for euermore. Which showth (as spiders calte, that no sedicion: Can haue good sucses. In flies inferior: By stoburne war, but by humbyll peticion: For thing interior, or exterior. Flies must sew: to the spider superior. They take this as a full hold: not to be remist, Well framid flies, wyll suffre and not resist. Flies wreks in wars: in time past: yf flies reuolue, How spiders copwebs: flies sepultures haue beene, Your wise quiet retire, shall this war disolue. By yf smart of time past: be forgoton cleene, Cast Iye to parell, at Iye presentlie seene. Uew yonder copweb castell: with endifrent iye: And marke whether ye be macht endifrentlye, Behold: the batilments in euerie loope: How thordinance lieth: flies fer and nere to fach. Behold: how euerie peece: that lith there in groope: Hath a spider gonner: with redy fired mach. Behold: on the wals: spiders waking ware wach. The wach spider: in the towre a larum to strike, At a proch of any nomber, showing war like. Se thenprenabill fort: in euery border. How euerie spider: with his weapon doth stand. So thorowlie harnest: in so good order: The capitall spider: with weapon in hand. For that sort of sowdiers: so manfully mand. With copwebs: like casting netts: all flies to quell, My hart shaketh at the sight: be hold: it is hell. Against whose strength there, your weaknes here behold. Sum haue harnes: most haue none: all out of rey. Capitaynes: practised: politike and bold, Few or none haue ye: this armie to conuey. But eche in others neck: as sheepe start a strey. Ordinance meete for the ship, ye bring to the feelde. But force without order: winth victorie seelde. And put case: that of you fortie thousand flise: Thirtie thousand: shall scape, and his window win. Yet: if ech one of you: in him selfe surmise: That he shalbe one: that shall die entring in, What one flie (of all flies) wil thassaute begin? No one, but that one that from home now come, Shall thinke him selfe wisest, that sonest goth home. But to die all: and in this window nought geyne: Of that: sayde practise of time past: assewrth ye. To venter life: and suffer deth, are thinges tweyne. Uentring of life, tobteyne right, oft se we. But to venter life: where deth hath certente, For these kinds of right: to die: while ye may liue, No wise flie will: but right rather ouer giue. But if your harms of time past: be forgoten, Warning of present harms: at present time take. Of which two measures: if none may be moten, Time past, nor time present, (of which two I spake,) Let the third: time to cum: be meane, thend to make. Weying that in time to cum. The end must cum: To one end of foure, which folow here in sum. After this war begoon, either both parts shall: Take ende with condision: as both part? can gre, Or continew in war, time perpetuall: Or the flies (by the spiders) conquered shalbe, Or the spiders conquered by the flies. Now se: How: in eche one end of these fowre: shall a rise, Paynfull perelus penuries, to all flies. First: if ye after a time had in conflickt: Take ende with the spider: by composicion, Beside the flies: that to death shalbe addickt: The suruiuers: shall receyue such condicion: At the spiders hand: as the distribicion: Shall make flies at end: bid fie on their winning, And after that end: repent their beginning. Second: this war: continuing continualy, Euery yere, moneth, weeke, day, howre, euery minute: Many flies shall die. and all may feare to dy: What flie can besure: one howres life texecute: At poyntes of all weapons, euer had in pursute. In vndoughted death: and doughtfull deadly life, This ende sheweth small difrens, where reason is rife, Thirdly: yf the spider do conquere you flise, What so euer flie then: him selfe best be haues: The best and the worste: all in one rate shall rise. Now frank free franklin flies, then all vile bonde slaues. Now flie in light windowse, then sit in darke caues. Flies beginning war: ending thus, they shall clere, Their hell or purgatory, begin euine here, The fourth: yf you flies shall the spider conqueare, Then shall all spiders go to wracke first: no dout. And after shall the flies folow: eueri wheare. When flies haue kild spiders: that stey the rewde rout, Then flie against flie: comun cuthrote moste stout. Foure endes: in this one war: show (thone and thother, The last being worste,) ech end wors then other. In time past: time present: and in time to coome: Sins ye haue woon: do win: nor shall win here ought, Beter wende your ship a loofe: and take sea roome: Then roon here on rockes, and to shipwrak be brought: It is to fer fet: and ferder to dere bought: To fet: and bye thinges: with no les los in striues: But with los: both of all your liuinges and liues. Here haue I sayde my minde: vnder principles few, First: desiring you to here me thorowly. Ere ye iudge any part, of what I should shew. And then to iudge me, by equite equaly. Whervnto: for hereing in this case sewde I, First for me, next for you and me, last for you. Of which proses a brigde, brefe pith aprochth now. For me: the flies and butterflies tales: I weyde: To my discharge. Sins I cam: of all offence. And before I cam, my discharge my selfe leyde, Wherein: my case being giltles inosence, For you and me, both in reson and consiens. To saue both sides vpright, this counsell I gaue. You to saue my life, your honestie to saue. For you and not me: in your present quarell, On this principle, my hole talke did depende. Ere we ought begin: namelie thing of parell, Wisdom wilth vs, to haue an Iye to the ende. In parelus quarelus case: to contende: Chieflie this: in time past: present: and to cum, How ye sped: and be like to spede, I shoud the sum. But to end at beginning: you casting Iye, At this poore counsell: of poore Antonie ant, Of shap and good wit small: of good will great and hye, I shall reioyse. Hoping here shall be no want: Of equite: in my discharge this instant. Which I humbly pray: and so to end to fall, I say no more: but the great God saue you all. This done: a noyse began of such a huzzing, Ech one flie blowing in an other flies eare, As if ten milions of flies had ben buzzing. And all: by this tale so astonide in feare, That most of them: their weapons could scantly beare, Thants perswasions: in drede of deth: strake them so, That hundreds cride oute, home a gayne let vs go. With this mounser graund captayne the great bragger: Was much a mased, and vengeably vext. To se these flies now: so vnstedily stagger, So late so redie: to bring their foose perplext. This time (thought he) should giue warning to the next, Yf he scaped this: at all times to be ware, With faint fond flies, to fiske agayne a warfare. He be gan to cast: that in commun knowne gise: In all like tumults: that flies do thus procure: Of simple flies, most are pardned that thus rise. But captaine flies (as he is now) are hangd sure. Of which present daunger, to put delaie in vre. He wound into that tree: and silence woon, The flies tencorage againe, this he be goon. Thant hath set the flies in such feare of the spiders, that most are redie to ronne awaie. whom to staie, the captaine flie deuiseth thant to set the spiders in like feare of them: by a tale tolde on the same grounde that he tolde this: in paine of hanging at his returne. Cap. 58. Sirs: I se well this tale of this ant here told, To passe this scone parel, putth you in such dreede, That manie are minded to leaue of their hold. As though leauing of now, should your safgard breede. As it should not. Nor for that it should in dede, His tale is told nowhit. But all told for this. To saue him selfe, and those spiders freends of his. He seeth what and whie he saith. Which you se nat. He foreseeth: if feare driue vs to ronne awaie, That we shall not onlie leese this window plat, But in fleeyng, like flease kild in chase from raie. Which shalbe (he knowth well) our leyserlesse daie: To be iaylers to ants, and he thervpon, (Being his owne Iayler) breakth iayle and is gone. This waie: our enemies win all, and we leese all. They laugh, and we wepe. They liue, and we die. They in fame, we in shame. Perpetuall. And without cost, paine, or daunger, by and by, This ant at libertie, immediatlie. Thus: where th?ts woords show him to be your great fr?de, Pyth of thants woords: proue him to be your great feende. Sum clarks (of whom this litle ant not least clark) Can: fine lies: as finelie as fine trew tales, tell. Right side: or wrong side: they can turne in eche woork, And make flies take either side, trew as gospell. Which turne in this tale: to appere in sequell, I haue deuisde a waie: (hauing your consent,) Here it: and speake to it as your brests are bent. As this ant clarklie (or craftelie here,) Hath cast manie masing mists before your iyse: Of much dread by much daunger, here to a pere, So: vpon his life or deth, let him deuise, Upon the same ground: that your feare doth a rise, A speech to the spiders. To show what depe dreads, He can draw or driue, in to their harts and heads. Which ground is this. Ere anie wight ought begin, Haue an Iye to thend. The wise wight sayth: (sayth he,) Wherin: (to mach the feare that you be now in,) If he bring spiders: in as much feare of ye: As he hath brought you in feare of them to be, Then at returne pardon him. Goods, life, and land. Which if ye do not, then hang him out of hand, Be it so cried all: then sayd this one that all leades, Choose fortie flies: to gard this ant that here stands. Twentie: whose hands we trust more then their heades. And twentie: whose heades we trust more then their hands. All of hart trustie: both power and polisis bands And for feare of fals measures: among all theese, Send sum, that sumwhat leaue behinde: loth to leese. This sayd, and thant sworne, his best here to be bent, An harold with trompet: and truce baner spleyde: For their safe conduckt, to the spider they sent. The spider: warnd watch, to se their cuming steyde. It should (to his honour,) be reproche he sayde. To treate with traytors: in order of arms, But of grace, he graunth them to cum without harms, The harold and that reste: to the captaine flie: And all flies, the spiders pleasure did declare. Wherwith: to gard thant, they chose out flies fortie. Whome: while they were choosing, one cople thare: Two flies of bysie wit: as sondry flies are, Fell to deuining: by coniecture to show, What should: in this mesage, and mesenger, grow. How seist thou my frende (quoth thone flie) to this gere: What woldest thou giue to haue the Ants office now? Geue (quoth thother flie,) not paring of a Pere. Nor I (quoth he) but wolde rather make a vow, To leaue all that I haue, and liue at the plow: Then take it. Whats thy minde therin (quoth thother?) That shalt thou here (hering this, quoth he) brother. If so fall: that thant bringe not spiders in feare, Then seth he him self hanged: at cuming againe. And bringing spiders in feare: when he cumth theare, He is in daunger, of the head spiders disdaine. Which is a nother death. And to scape both twaine, I take it to be, a bisie, peece of warke. And to shoote at, a croked crabid marke. For both these cases (quoth thother flie) put case: In either case of both, thant? deth do ensew. Yet in which case of both: deth shall first take place, That will thant labour, fyrst and most, to eschew. Whose first parell: in handes of vs flies to vew, It shall enfors the ant: in all the force he may, For feare of death by flies: the spiders to fray. Note (quoth thother flie) to this, this obiection, Nature in the spiders and the ant: ioyneth nie. Which: shall make thant ieperd much: by affection. In spightful woordes: to comfort spiders spightfully. Rather then discomfort them: thus fearingly, I haue seene sum, that for this like cause vpstood, Whose craftie coucht tales, haue done more harme th? good. They haue done so (quoth thother) and they do so. Where feare is small, by penalte being small: But where penalte (as here) to death doth go, In the ants like tales: few trip: or none at all. Manie say oft, honger perseth the stone wall. But honger and feare: where both cum in like vre, Feare perseth: as depe as honger, make ye sewre. The father his sonnne: and the sonne his father: The wife her husband: and the husband his wife: The brother, his brother, all these we gather: To haue seene: (compeld by feare,) where feare was rife, Bewrey, and be trey echother. In feare of life, Seeld se we: so naturall a foolish kind elf, But he will hang his father: to saue him self, Oft (quoth thother) tys so, sum times otherwise. Of flies condemd, the father and sonne, both haue: Upon their knees: sewde with flowing watred Iyse: Ech him self to be hangd: the other to saue. That sute (quoth thother flie) is no comon slaue: But in his apparence: so straunge a straunger, That his presence (this time) wyll bring no daunger. But contrarie: in these like stormes we se oft, Where Ants, spiders, or flies thants like tale must tell, Or they in auctorite: forst vp a loft, Not for that their setters vp: trust their truths well, But (as this ant) made instruments at parell: There shall feare force them: for feare of suspicion, To sticke fast, to their forsers disposicion. They wot (or they weene,) that they be watched so, That if they be but suspect: to wring a wrie, They be vndone: I would rather choose my fo, To be my iudge: in case iudiciallie: Then my freend. in this fearfull forst state: for whie, Feare of forcers shall force him: more eide to rate, To his foe: whome they loue, th? his friend: whom they hate, Yee say well (saide thother) but I sey to this, Saide suspected sortes: in feare of auctorite, Not withstanding: suspition daungerus is: Yet sum, in faction or affection we se, Or other corruption, so affected be, Though life lie vpon it: yet by meane direct, Or indirect, they woork their affections effect, And so for this ant: our soole cause of talk now. What euer othe in promise: he for feare make, To bring spiders in feare: to bring them to bow. Yet: either for natures: or affections sake, I feare, he will wililie the wrong waie take. And I hope (quoth thother) his present parell, Shall stiflie streme him, to strengthen our quarell. But betwene you and me: in fine thus is it. You feare here the worst, and I hope here the best. You in which feare: and I in which hope, let vs sit, Silentlie tyll practise by profe haue exprest, In what scope (for what scape,) the ants tale shall rest. The other flie beyng a greede vnto this, To se this end, both attend as meete now is. This talke doone, fortie flies (and thant with them flew Streight to the spider: before whom thant now standes. But how thant fleeth now, that shall eftsoone ensew. The spider was garded: round about with bandes. Sauing: a lane, made with tipstaues: and other wandes: That thant to the spider: in hering and show, Myght saie (as he did saie) at curtsie made low. Thant after entre in talke (before the hed spider) he to hym, and all the spiders (vpon this saide grounde: ere thou ought begin: haue a iye to the ende,) inueyth what he can to set the spiders in feare of the flies. Cap. 59. Honorable syr maie it your honour like: To consider: that in affaires meare mundeine, Polisie: and powre: do not the stroke so strike: That strife (at staues end) for victorie or geyne: Winth alwaie the strong, on the weake tobteyne: But sumtime we see: fortune, hap, or chaunce, The weaker: aboue the stronger, in strife a vaunce. Wherof: my selfhere mirrour to behold, Sum polisie, politike heads thinke I haue. And of your powre at hand. Might haue ben bold. But polisie and powre: my self now to saue, Chaunce wold not suffer: but chaunce both awaie draue. Sodennesse of chaunce: this chaunge in me hath wrought, From liking liuelie life, to dolefull death brought. With halter here about my necke, as ye se. Respight haue I woon, to se you ere I die, For two things. One to praie all to praie for me. An other, (as I am bound naturallie:) To warne all: of deepe daunger here presentlie. At iye, in hand. But ye your heads draw nere, To here and vse my counsell folowing here. This sage saying, the wyse haue saide and saie. Haue an iye to the ende, ere thou ought begin. Of this debate: begon then, thend here waie. What small or no pleasure, ye can therin win. And what great displeasure, ye may be brought in. Prouing you: (at best) nought to win by this war, And prouing you: (at worst) vtterlie to mar, One point of foure, this strife cumth to of neede. Either: after strife: tagree by agreement, Or euer to striue and neuer be a greede, Or you to subdew the flies: by the swoords dent, Or the fllies to conquere you, by force feruent. Now: if this beginning, shall furder begin, Cast a line to thend, and mete what ye shall win. First: tagree after time of strife tasted, In meane time: on both sides the mortalitee, Your copwebs, theyr cotages, worne and wasted, All windowes vacant: of most fertilytee. All from good order, to sinfull ciuilitee. The best end (for both sides, being extended, The beginning (on both sides) shalbe repented. Next: to continew in perpetuall strife. Purgatorie that (nay that is hell say I,) Better deade, then euer liue in feare to loose life, As both sides shall liue: euermore dyingly. Still sterting from sleape, all sleapt with waking iye. I better like mine end: looking for end streight, Then thus vpon this endles end: still to weight. Third: if you in subiection the flies subdew, Thacount bringth small gaine: to that end wedded: All flies ye can not kill: What shall then ensew? As manie as ye keepe in dred, to be hedded, So manie you dread: then who is most dredded. One flie put in feare, putth you in feare of ten. Tell here your cardes, and tell what ye win then. Fourth: if the flies conquere you, oh dredfull daye. Dead in halfe a daye: ye shalbe euerie one. Of the three other wayes: in euerie one waye, Both sides (in effect) like ill: end vpon. But in this fourth, (feare wherof is my most mone) Where all flies shall win all: and brauelie bost all, All spiders shall lease all, and spiders be lost all. If ye replie here: and saie flies (to this daie) Neuer wan this way: but euer in losse lapt: In reioyner: reioyning with you, this I saie. Hit hapth in one houre, that before neuer hapt. As it hapth me this houre: with flies to be trapt. And that this is more like to hap this present, Then it erst hath bene, mark this present bend bent. See (I saie) echone his death here (as who saye. Fiue thousand spiders: on thone side to fight, Against fiftie thousand flies, (oh fearfull fraye) A heape to a handfull. The more side so light: The lesse side so heuie: tis a heuie sight: In sondrie respectes. Wherin no one of anie. Fearthe me so much, as so few: to so manie. Were they all cowardes, as thei are hardie flise. Not the least flie there: but he dare bite his bit, On the greatest Oxe: that in the shambles lise. No weapon but the flap, shall make him thens flit. Of the which weapon: spiders can skill no wit. But though flies: but cowardlie stacke to the helme, Yet must the numbre: this copweb ouerwhelme. Ten to one (in war) an vnmeete matched match. They will marche on, as thick, as motes in the soon. Ten thousand (in a moment) if ye dispache, Twentie thousand mo, vpon speare poinct will roon The desperate, dreadth: nother byll, bow, nor gon. And what gaine you? to kill flies thick as motes? The rest entring on you streyght, and cut your throtes. And though they gesse: that manie of them shall die. Yet: if ech one think sure that scape he shall, As I think, all so think: assewredlie. Then that perswasion, shall perswade them all. Echone with other, streight in strife to fall. Who maie be formost flie: with corage hawte, Thonset to giue, this castell to assawte. Your wisdome: and your wisdoms all: I know. Much more: can here consider. Then I can How beit good will, wilth me: warning to show, Of harme to cum: in this begoon to scan. Before the end, what thend maie be, and than, To flee the worst, to fall (as you thinke best,) At sum poinct with the flies, to be at rest. Th?t hauing brought the spiders in great feare of the multitude of flies, the head spider takinge greate displeasure with the ant for the same, he answereth thantes tale so that he bringeth all the spiders in corage agayne. Geuinge (in his owne name and all theyrs,) defiance to the flies. Cap. 60. The spiders at thants tale, weare muche abasht. The flies (as thant set them out) feard the spiders sore Their weapons fell from hand: they weare quight quasht. Take peace with flies, they cride. At which rumorus rore, The head spider (with wheat tuskes fomde like a bore) In that rage: had not his honour line therone, Had thant had a thousand liues, he had bene gone. At this hurlie burlie, that spider le graund: In his cheyre fretting fewriouslie he frownith. His looke was commission: silence to commaund. Wherevpon: statelie and sternelie he entrith: A discors. The ants last told tale to meetwith. But first: thant to discredit, to thants dispreyse, On thants properties, this spider thus inueyse. Freendes: I perceyue the ants tale (more false then fine,) Makth you: your owne shadowes to dread (as it weare:) To prosede in war. But stey a litle tine: Lift vp your hartes all, and ech one lend one eare: Tyll ye haue hard: how I this tale shal answeare. But ere I touch the pith: of thantes tale in this, Heare of what propertie, thant him selfe is. The Ant (cumme into the world out of the shell,) For a time (in his time) creepith on the ground. As we spiders creepe here: and his pisse as fell In stinging as our poyson (welny is found.) Which properties, woork him toward our nature wound. Wherby Antes be and haue bene taken: in all age, Our halfe cosins: a lide in side halfe linage, This time, is the Ant, the creping ant named. In time after this time, he to more time growne, Winges doth he gather. And those in him framed, The flieing ant: thensforth he is cald and knowne. Then dispersth his nature, in two natures throwne. He pertisipateth, with both these in this wise. A creper with spiders, and a flier with flise. When he crept hither first (at my request heare,) I was diseyued in his age. (As the deuill wolde.) I thought him to young to haue winges, by a yeare. But now, he wingd with flies, his flieing tale tolde, Doth show him old ynough: and a yeare to olde. Marke this creeping Ant: sins wings wownd him a loft. How he pleyth on both handes: as Iuglers do oft. He corageth the flies now, discoraging vs. But didst thou not erst, promise me otherwise? Here: is thant brought to a narow streight, as thus. If thant tell the spiders: how he fraide the flies, Then seeth he his death, at flies handes: streight a rise, And if he saie he coragde the flies, that lie, Shall make the spiders hate him, without cause whie. Thant: hauing to this demaund: good answer none, None answere made he: but stoode still silently. Lo (quoth the spider) is not thant a good one? Were he charged in law herwith: by and by, This obstinate silence, should show him gilty. But thant him selfe now: thus fer forth disclosed, Gowe now to thants matter: erst preposed, His great ground is this: (wheron the whole dependth, Uew thend of all, ere the beginning be woon. Wherin: if he a ledge here charge: that extendth: To vs spiders, that we this war first begoon, That charge is wrong charged. for that charge must roon; Unto the flies: for they enuaders here be. And we but defenders: as all iyes may se. And for the foure pointes: wherof one must thend make. In three of which: he laide losse indiffrentlie, To lot on both sides a like: I vnder take, In few woordes: to proue that tale a lowde lewde lie. First: war here taken vp condisionallie, Flies neuer woon end of vs: after beginning, But flies (at end) euer bad fie on their winning. The second: concerning war continuall: In weat open feelde they, in drie warme house we. Betweene these two plats, though the distance be small, The biffrence is great. Of the yeres four partes: thre, Or two parts at leaste,) they can not trouble ye. In winter, sommer flies no windowes keepe. Under mens house eaues: like eauis droppers they creepe. The third point: in our conquering of the flies: For fearing of all flies: that we make a frayde, The foole, or the infant, that his shadow spies: Wyll oftimes crie out in feare: calling for eyce. But wiser foolk weing this, thus is it weyde. Like feare to be had: on their conquered knaues, As hath the great Turke: feare of his galie slaues. Last, to the fourth: if flies shall spiders conquere: Then are all spiders lost: as the ant saith sure. And flies to (saie I) but as touching that feare: For time past, of practice: put memorie in vre. For time to cum, let liklihod you alure. To serch that kind of conquest: and ye shall se, It neuer was, nor is, nor neuer like to be. From the beginning: it is in bookes to show. When flies (against spiders) haue thus rebelled, They: either had miserable ouer throw: In rebelling, or streight after refelled. Namelie one: the whith generallie swelled. In flies against spiders, the time past six yeare, Which one (were there no mo) showth this case cleare, This time: sondrie. But chieflie, two flockes of flise, For religion: with sum other thing to that, One sort by east, an other by west: did rise. Of opinion, contrarie: as fer and flat, As in distance, ech far from other in plat, Thone sort of both: to be in right faith elect, All flies (faithfullie) did beleue or coniect. Those flies did much harme: six or eight weekes anoying, Which time: spiders had small rest, and those flies lesse. Spiders copwebs: went to wrack. by distroying: And flies welth wasted: to begerie from richesse Forestore lasht out, in excreable excesse. Frutes then growne, much lost for helpe to get them in. How lookte flies here? to thend ere they did begin. But what was the end of this? for soth euen this. The captayns, most hangd. Soldiers, many slaine. The rest (oughtworth) geuen in praie for pilagis. So that (to this daie,) they bid fie on the gaine. Thus were these two sortes: of opinions twaine, One of the twayne: in the right way to be thought, Both brought to one end, and both brought to nought. Which showth: that where flies in matter of most right: Atempt tataine mater right: in maner wrong, There: their wr?g maner, marth their right matter quight, For spiders agaynst flies, great Gods law standth strong. Which law (in leading flies) hath willed this long. You base inferiors to woorke your lordes wyll, Obey your superiours, be they good or yll. Thus: were their matter as good, as it is bad. And we as weake, as the ant hath made you deeme. Yet should thill maner: in flies here now had, Set that God vpon them, to strike strokes extreeme. As by the example told, the show doth well seeme. Thus: for the flies conquering of vs this daye, Goddes eyde all dayes before: takth all feare awaye. But put case we had not (as we haue) the Godds eide: But both sides: acording to force of our powers, Shuld conquere or be conquered, or (as thant saide) Hap hapth in one houre, as hath hapt in no houres. Which he last a leaged, to schape our sharp showres. with other his framd feares, of our confusion. Yet: thant here to confute, here my conclusion. In the later part of his saing (I say) He saith we maie be distroide: as hap may fall. And it must be graunted: that hap so fall may, But graunt that hap so maie: ergo hap so shall, That argument hath strength, like a paper wall. May fall: and shall fall. are fer diferent marks: To shote at. But when the skie falth we shall haue larks. For the feare, that his tongtromp (to you did sowne:) By thus manie flies: to thus few spiders seene, Setten flies with ten axes, one oke to hew downe. That Oke shall be hackt at: a good while I weene, Ere it will shrinke for flies: be it seare or greene. And the leaste twig: that out of that Oke can fall, (The Oke standing still:) shall slea those ten flies all. And so we Oke spiders: against these twig flise. Were they all great flies: as most of them be gnatts. And to one of vs, fortie of them do rise. Yet as the giantes pawes: pat downe dandipratts, So shall we put downe: these dandiprat brag bratts. Their most nombre: with our most strength to compare, Pooding prikes they, mylposts we: comparde are. And where he saith: though flies thinke manie shall dy: Yet: ech flie thinking him self shall scape with life, They will striue: who shall set on first: here sate I, At end of that strife: they entred in this strife, The foole hardie flies: now most redie or rife: To cum with the first: shall feele the taste so tough, That: who cumth last: shall thinke he cumth time inough. Thants tale (from point to point) now full answered, All force of our feare here: it wiping a waie, T'enforce you from feare: furder encoraged, Heare: and beare a waie: what I shall herin saie. A few woords, hilie to your comfort this daie. Which shall set you all: as fer out of all feare, As the ant? tale set you all in feare; while eare. Mark: all you: that in marking your enemies, Their force (and not your owne) do onlie behold, A deadlie dreadfull sight it is: in your iyes. But on your owne force: your iyes being round rold: The selfe sight of this force: shall you so enbold, That had you no weapons here: but hasill wands, Yet might ye count, your enemies now in your hands. Mark more: that your foes: in beholding you: Are strikin in as deepe dread: your force to vew, As you are of theirs: which setth both sides euine. now: Marke yet more: they haue y? wr?g part, you haue the trew, Against godds and manns law: this wrong thei pursew, Both which: so strike them: when they wold preuayle, That their atempt, euer hath quaild, and shall quaile. So coward a spider: where can be sene one? That will not liue and die: in this his knowne right, Shuld all spiders die: (as few shall or none) Yet in this quarell, spiders go to blisse quight, And flies to bale, without respect of respight. Wherfore let the flies, the ants lesson atend: At their this beginning, to haue iye to thend, And now (at end) dere freends all, pluck vp your hartes Take your weapons in hand: and stand vp againe. Sticke to your takling: in this plat on all partes. And as for the flies, (their fare to show them plaine) When euer they cum, they shall cum to their paine. Stand stiffe to me, and stand stiffe to you I shall. Flies and flies kin, we defie you traytours all. The spider thus answering thants tale at length. From poynt to point: no poynt therof omitted, All spiders: againe in full coorage and strength: Those flies to their flock: with thant againe flitted. Two of them (to the captayne knowne well witted: To flie into the tree: he streight commaundeth, And thant vnto the ladder againe, forthwith. Upon defi?ce geuin by the spider to the flies, the ant brought agayne to the flies, maketh full report of all sayde at the copweb. At end wherof, two flies argue wether thant haue deserued life or death. By keeping or breaking former comnant to bring the spiders in feare of the flies. Cap. 61. That Captaine wild one of those flies to declare, What had (since they parted) passed in this case. And if he ought addid: or minished thare, The Captaine wild thother, tentrupt him in place. That trewth: trewlie, might appere without deface. Whervpon the flie: assigned to saie than, In a solem order, the processe began. First: thants tale told the spiders: he did repeate. And the feare: that that tale brought the spiders in. Then in repeate, the spiders tale he did treate. And what recoorage that did the spiders win. With defiance giuen flies, their alie, and kin. The captayne then axt: you that went forth tell me. Is this tale trew and the whole treuth? all said ye. Two thinges (quoth the captayne) are to touch here on. First: whether thant haue deserued to liue or die. The seconde, apeece of the spiders tale gon. Which I shall touch soone: but first thantes case lets trie. Upon his life or death, standing presentlie. To se that case: by agrement fullie scande, It being (I saie) first case to take in hande. It is so in deede (quoth one flie) in the tree. Wherin: while memorie keepeth matter in minde, I praie you all pacientlie to here me: Uprightlie declare (as equite doth binde.) Without affection: anie wrong waie to winde. But euin as conscience: to speake: doth me compell, So shall I speake this tale, which I shall now tell. Where I haue heard wise flies talke: I haue herd leide, In weightie cause: weightie consideration. And thers no matter: more wrightie to be weide Then that: in which: vpon consultation Lithe life or death: in determination. And presentlie present this Ants case: meane I: To waie consideratelie, and indifferentlie. Whose life: or whose death: before we determin: Which of both to determin: meete is to wey, Your late determind condicion. pith wherin, Was: that thant should bring spiders in such like frey Of vs, as he brought vs of them. and I saie: He hath done so. So that in my conscience, Life and liberte must he haue, to go hence. And I saie naie (quoth the flie) in the tree by: He hath not performed that condision at full: To haue his life, hath he not (quoth thother flie? To make profe a pere here: to witts quicke and dull: That performance will wee reason, if ye wull, Beet (quoth thother slie,) but all flies giue an eare, To one thing good for all: awaie to beare. My brother flie, (and I seeming here to varie: Both being on one part: seeming on parts twaine: In that in this one point, we are contrarie: Ech one to other: it maie make you retaine: And detaine a dout, whether we both remaine: Constant, on that part that we professe: or no. But here me furder here: ere we furder go. Thargument of vs tweine, is onlie this one. Concerning the condision toucht formerlie: Either by performance: or performance none, How the ants desert standth, to liue or to die. Thant should liue sayth he, thant shuld die (say I.) Now consider: that this present argument, Is: to principall case, but an incident. Our cheife cuming is: on spiders to make war. By cause we no way els, can obtaine our right. Wherin: we ioyne with you, without iote of iar. This remembre I you of: to scrape out quight, All doughtes of our trewth: in iudgement of heddes light. For this case: or like case in case: vsed thus, Showth mistrust in no wight: anie case to discus. And now we tweine to satisfie (as we can) Our selues: and to se you the rest satisfide, Aleage brother flie: what ye can herin scan. Wherto, mine answere shall forthwith be applide. Thants life or death: in our iudgements to se tride. That shall (quoth the other flie without delay, Cum in vre: as brieflie, as it fullie may. Thant (in his charged tale) to spiders told erst, Grounded thus: ere ought begin: haue iye to thend, At end of thants talke, spiders harts it so perst, That it stagard and stonide all that hole bend. Weapons falne to ground. this out crie they extend. Shaking of their headdes: and casting vp their iyes. Take peace with the flies, take peace with the flies. Thant made spiders of flies: as much a frayde tho, As he made flies of spiders, in tale erst told. I graunt (quoth thother flie) in deede he did so. Wherto you must graunt: that that feare did not hold, For spiders (forthwith) were againe brag and bolde. Though they so were (quoth he) thant performde cumna?t, That (quoth thother flie) for trew, I can not graunt. There is (in thants cumnant) further meaning ment: Then the verie wordes therin fullie expresse: To bring spiders: in feare of flies: by bond bent: Is not all, that all flies looke fore: in sucsesse: But to bring and keepe them in that fearefulnesse. Bringing them in feare: not keping them in feare, As fruitfull to flies, as paring of a peare. To answere this quidite (quoth thother flie) You can haue no more of the Foxe but the skin, The ant hath done all that he can possiblie, To bring spiders in feare: and kepe them therin. Whose good will not wanting, though powre cannot win: Thing that good will wold win: yet is it not ill, Rather then blame lacke of power, to thank good will. Put case (quoth thother) thant outh you fortie pound, Bound in obligacion, to paie at a daie. At which daie, he cumth to you (as he is bound:) And where he should bring powre: fortie pounde to paie, He bringth good will: and will paie you when he maie. Whether wold ye more: (in this case of your) Accept thants good will, or blame thants lacke of pour. What I wold do (quoth the other) I know nat. But what I should do, that right well I know. Thant thowing full good will, to paie me that: And that lacke of pour: without his faut did grow, I should in trobling thant: in consciens show: A rigur. ye (quoth thother flie) but in law, To what end: wold thants good will without pour draw: In this case (quoth he) commun law condemth thant. In that the woordes of the bond, are fulfild no whit. Performance wherof: in thants case, hath no want. Which maie a pere to flies, of most simple wit. In marking these wordes: of this cumnant here knit: Thant (paine of death) shall bring spiders in like feare: Of flies, as he brought flies, of spiders: here eare. These are (in thants cumnant) the wordes in effect: Which bind the ant: the spiders in feare to bring: But to keepe them in feare, no woord runth direct. And commun law: commonlie in euerie thing, Constrewth woordes, in their common plaine sence licing. And that thant made spiders a fraide, ye do graunt. Ergo, thant (by common law) hath kept cumnaunt. Now: to bring this case in courte of consience: Declaring our meaning in these woordes: to be: That thant should kepe spiders in feareful suspence, Thant answering to this: that neuer ment he: To be bounde: to that inconuenient decre, The iudge (in this case and place) must nedes assent, With thants meaning (against oures) to geue iudgement. In law, conscience, and reason, as thinkth me, The desert of this ant, doth his pardon craue. Landes, goods, bag, baggage, life, and liberte. Freends (quoth thother flie) I haue a soule to saue: Whervpon I proteast: I no malice haue: To thant. But in reason, I thinke he should die. This saide, those flies to their place againe did flie. At ende of this last argument. The captayne axing the ant what he can saye? whye he should not die, the ant after a few woordes submitteth him to their order. Wherevpon the captaine goinge to the question, the ant is condemde by the voyce of the most nombre. The captaine then willing hym to make his last prayers, he doth so. Cap. 62. The captaine (to this) axt thant how sayst thou? What hast thou to saie, why thou shouldst not die here The talke (quoth he) for me, by the flie had now. In reason, law, and conscience, doth me clere. Whose which tale, doth much more pithilie appere. For my selfe, then if my selfe had told it. And as he told it, I pray all to hold it. Wherin: as I haue kept comnant at the full, So craue I of you, to kepe cumnant with me, Here stand I: to liue or die now, as ye wull. But in killing me (a poore ant) what win ye: Or what leese I: neither profite nor honeste. Honest death, in honest fame, shall perseuer. Unhonest life, vnhonest shame shall haue euer. Then saide the captaine: freends though I now at will; Onlie by vertue of mine auctoritee: Might geue iudgement here: this ant to saue or spill: Yet will I not geue it: but graunt to agree, To se this case decreede, by comun decree. Which shalbe tride, by these two wordes: ye, and no. And streight to the question herein, let vs go. All you that will haue the ant liue, say ye. Ye, ye: (with a loude voice) cride a great nomber tho, Now (quoth the captaine) on thother side: lets see: All that will not haue the ant to liue, saie no. No, no: cride out manie, and showde manie mo: Then weare on thother part. Then saide the captaine, Ant: of thine owne death, thou herest here iudgement plaine. I commit me (quoth thant) to the great gods will. Say thy prayers (quoth the captaine) ere thou dye. On the ladder, downe on knees half dead he fill. Forthwith saying his deuocion deuoutlie. In which while two flies togither wondringlie: Thinking thant: to be wrongfullie cast awaie, In talke betwene them selues, as folowith did saie. While the ant saith his prayers on the ladder, two flies thinking him to be wrongfullie cast a waie, pitteing the case, they touche (in talke) three sortes of flies seene there then. Wherin is toucht sum parte of the properties of newter flies. Cap. 63. Oh freend (quoth the tone flie) what a chaunce is this? An innosent ant: among fllies to be cast: The deede in deede (quoth thother) damnable is. I thought sure, we should with thants life haue past. For where fortie flies irefullie: on thant fround fast, Three score, piteouslie lookt: as they thant wold saue. And yet thant cast by voyce, great wonder I haue. To the two sortes, that ye speake of (quoth the tother) Thone sort geuen to saue thant: thother thant to kill, A third: sort indiffrent to thone part or thother. Did here (and do els wheare) most part of all ill. Whose mischeuous maners, partli show I will. Cumming (comunlie) in practised exercise, Both among spiders, and also among flise. These indiffrentes (or newters) that part most take, That strongest is, or strongest like to be. And which side they leane to, such nombre they make, That they beare the bell awaie: and most apt we se, To cleaue to the ill part, euine of properte. Which properte proueth (in sortes last or furst,) That of all sortes, this last saide sort is wurst. And yet oft: estemid with the best. For whie, They fashion them selues: to folow euer more: Those that be (or like to be (I saie the most hie. But to all: late a loft: now laide on low shore, To whom: they haue made curtsie most low before: They either se them not, or ouer looke them. If chaunce once imbase them, they maie not brooke them. Two buckets in a well, thone vp and thother downe. They stand on the bucket, that standth on the brim. Which bucket desending, they begin to frowne. The bucket assending: midwaie they mete him. And bucket for bucket: straight thexchange made trim. For a mong all buckets (take this a plaine matter) They bide with no bucket: thats driuen to drink water. They must haue wine: with fare and chere of the best. Which: where and while it lasteth: in anie place, Who maie show gratitude in semblance fayrest: Therin contend they: to geue glosse of good grace, To their viander: who maie him most imbrace. Where they may win ought: by fayre disimilate show, There they flickar, and flatter, in fauer to grow. But their enterteinment once drawing to ende, They make none a count: of thanks from beginning: Thend of their chere, endth the thanks of that bend. Streight from that place: they are speedilie spinning, To an other host, good cheere: good cheape winning. But to paie for boord, where euer this flock boords, Their currant coine: is lowe curtsie, and fayre woords. Which coine (to them) not costlie: and yet so scant, That where and when soeuer their chere faile, Then doth all curtsie, and thanks for chere had, want, And not onlie good woords: in most of them quaile, But some of the worst sort, that are geuen to raile, To turne recompence on the wrong side or shore, Grue ill wordes, for good deedes, of frendes had before. These folike freendes: otherwise feendlike fose, Are much like mermaides: thone halfe flesh thother fishe. On all texts: for all sides, they do giue such glose, As maie seeme to serue all sides, as wit would wishe. By which desimulacion double deuilishe, They wind: in and out: here and there: to and fro, As the Reede with the winde, euerie waie they go. And like as we se the Oke: in stought storme of winde: Standing stiffe against the wynde: ouerthrowne, And the Reede: wauing with the winde, still we finde: Sauing it self, in all our blastes of winde blowne, So in spiders and flies: like lot oftims growne. Trew stiffe standers against the winde: ouerthrowe, Fals flattring folowers with the winde, stand and growe. Of our open knowne freendes, we maie be sure. Of our open knowne fooes, we maie be ware. But these vnnaturall neuters: here in vre, Neither sure of, nor ware of, anie wightes are. Either flattring lies: they sotlelie declare: Or when they saie trew (if euer they saie trew.) That saie they: for false or ill purpose tensew. They are freendes to no man. But in respect, Them selues to take good: or to avoide harme: Or to do harme: of reuenging effect, They will attempt: by corrupsion to charme, Those: vnder whose winges, they maie sit close and warme. To coole and controle: such as make anie show, To bend anie waie: from the bent of their bow. To regard a right, a dog hath deuocion: As much as they. But be it right or wrong: For loue, hate, dreade, or meede, in promocion, If it serue theyr turne: to make the wrong part strong, That part will they sing, in all theyr sung song. As these indiffrent newter flies: haue done here, Whose wrongfull cleauing to the wrong, kilth thant clere. This (quoth thother( your saying hath made me se, Wherin: I praie to the great god hartilie, Be we spiders, be we flies, what euer we be, That we all maie (by his grace) cut of clerelie, All vnkindnesse, of newterlike indiffrencie. Thant now at point: from the ladder to be rold, A flie far of flinging toward them, cride holde hold. The ant hauing now made his prayers, beinge at poynt to be turnd from the ladder, a flie, a far of, crieth holde. Who (lighting in the tree) bringeth suche a message from the hed spider, as the Ant (thereby) is repride, and caried to prison. Cap. 64, Vpon lighting in the tree, this saide this flie: Being in scoutwatch: a spider spiyng me. In the head spiders name: wild me speedilie. To tell this to you all: if so be that ye: Put this ant to death: by currysh crewelte, He proteastith: that his prisoner flies hed, Shall stand on a stake, before thant be all dead. The spiders fauour to thant, made sum flies dout: How it came to passe, whether the spider then thought: In fearing spiders before. Thantes tale so stout, Was: more to saue his life, among flies then cought: Then to feare spiders: forwhich, the flies thant brought, And that the tauntes: that the spider thant gaue, Weare to cloke mystrust, that flies to thant might haue. Or that the spiders wife: pitteing thants case, Obteynd it by sute, or that the spider wold: Use the occasion, offered there then in place. To rid the flie, by that colour: and not hold, His bond. By promise made to the flie, erst told. Which was: to charge and discharge him of offence, As standth with reason, law, custom, and conscience. With this, a formall flie into the tree flew. Beginning thus: freendes: wise flies saie (and haue seide) Of two inconueniences, the worst eschew. The worst of which two here: a side to be leyde, The best of these two: is here first to be weyde. To saue this poore ant: to saue that pure flie, Or to slea thant, and both ant and flie slaine therby. Consideracions herin are so great, And so manie: and most of such weight, That they are: in counsell more meete to treate: Then to make an alebench talke of: to bebeight: For babling tounges to babble on, wherfore streight: Mine aduice is: that six or eight flies most wise, Closlie consult here, the best waie to deuise. Nay nay, (cride a thousand) we will none of that. We will be of counsell all. Yea will quoth he? That kind of counsell: is more meete to hallow at: Then to talke in. for if all of counsell be, Ye can in that counsell: haue no secrese, But (in counsel) where secrets lacketh anie, There is (ant least) one counseler to manie. We refuse that waie: cride the grose flies againe. Lest great wise flies, by and sell foolish flies small. If ye (quoth he) take to counsell all this traine, Then: nought being secret: all your enemies shall, Be of your counsell: and bie and sell you all. But sins ye will haue counsell cride at the crosse, I wyll disclose: that I wolde haue had kept closse. The flie in copweb: with the spider deteinde, We know what he is: we neede not here to boste him. To kill thant: and haue that flie kild, what is gainde? That shall all flies feele: after we haue lost him. But sins the spider: in such sort will host him: As we host the ant, our best waie doth apere, To kepe thant (as gage for gage) prisoner here. For though thant (trewth being tolde before his face) Be far to base: that fine flie to counterpeise: Yet if the spider esteeme thant: in like case: Aboue the flie: as we him aboue thant preise, Then for deliuerie of both (without steise, The spider will (in exchaunge) chaunge as gladlie, The flie for thant, as we will thant for the flie. Brieflie: the best way is here (in my mynde) To kepe thant prisoner in stockes fetred fast. Under gard of certeine flies, to be asinde, Tyll we se sumwhat of this war, furder past. And if we se cause, we maie kill him at last. Or chaunge him, for sum flie that spiders maie take, To this mine aduice, show yours, an end to make. At this: much bumbling among them all: there was. Manie woords, litle matter, and to no purpose. Nombre of sentences here, I maie let pas. As things not worth the hering here to disclose. And pas they must: for neither in rime nor prose: I can win memorie well to write with pen, The tenth sentence geuin there, against thant then. And though: memorie might the nombre, haue conteind, Yet was all confused so: in such bibble babble, All a like lowde, and all to loude, in voyce constreind, That all parts of best wit: had bene vnable: To catch, kepe, and make, thacount explicable: Of all sayings there saide. Wherfore (as I saie:) Not onlie they maie, but they must passe awaie. But finallie: all their chat chatted: anon, To the flies last tale: they all did so agree, That thant (garded) went to prison. Whervpon, Quoth the captaine: sins this is past by decree, Being one poynt of two: erst moued by me: To be moued to you, in thother poynt now, Conseiue, and reseiue the thing I shall show you. The captaine flie, inueith vpon matter before past: in such sorte so encoraging the flies againe, that anone thei all crying to the captaine to march forwarde, thei brauely set foorth. And laiyng their ordinaunce to the copweb castell, thei besege it rownde. Cap. 65, This thing I meane which brought spiders in fere Thant moued all the spiders: to cast their iyes, Upon vs their enmies. Whose show of strength there, Showde so puisant (by huge nombre of vs flies,) That they (much by that sight) gaue vp thenterpries. Wheron the spider, thre inuencions inueide. Reuiuing the spirits of the spiders in eide. First: the spider to this wild the spiders all, To cast iye from our force. And behold their owne. Which sight, such strength (he saide) to their harts must call, That a hartlesse harted spider: should be growne: Hardy to fight, till we flies be ouerthrowne. Hasill wands in their hands: to hawberds in ours, He macht: to ouer match vs, in our most powrs. Secondlie: he bad them thinke: that we do dreade: The sight of them, as much as they do feare vs. Thirdlie: to set cocke on hope and run on heade, Their right seene (saith he) to fight in: to death thus, The most coward will fight. And by his discus, Streight to blisse go they, streight to bale go wee. But: here me part the stake: in these casis three. First: we them beholding: and they vs vewing, The feare falth indiffrentlie: on eyther side. Next: ech side vewing it selfe hath ensuing: Of like coorage: to bothe sides to be a plide. Thirdlie: he labring right by fight to be tride: With clere conscience on their side, let that be weyde: Upon this my next saying: when I haue seyde. The spider to thant: in this told tale: erst saide, Laide to vs flies rebellion. He laying, Example of plages past. where flies disobaide, The great gods commaundement. Which disobaying, Hath plaged such flies, according to his saying. Upon his which saying: here me somwhat saie, How case of rebellion from our case doth waie. All subiects: in violent varience growne: Against the hie powrs, they by that great god plaste, His woorke hath showd his wyll, to bring ouerthrowne. Suffre, and not resist, that must be here enbraste: And fulfild. Or els as such flies, in time paste: Haue bene scourged: for resisting, so shall we. And so to be scourged, well woorthie we be. But perceyue: thesehie powrs: must take hie place, As standth with law of the great god: rightfullie. For otherwise, it falsifith in this case: Their saide defence at godds hand. and contrarie: Where extort pour: vsurpeth place wronfullie, The god doth right oft: in such vsurpacion, Put miraculus poure, to thexturpacion. Oft: making thinstrumentes of the ouerthrow: As fer to compare: vnder the ouerthrowne, As flies vnder spiders: in comparison show. And how this spider hath vsurpedlie growne, To potentate state, that is to vs vnknowne. I neuer herd flie yet, that euer could tell: Ground of title, whie his state should thus exsell. And he: an vsurper: as I thinke he is: You thinking so to, can we thinke that he? Breaking the Gods law (as he doth doing this) Shall in thil deede: by good god, defended be: Whome he and his offend: offending his decre, Naie: hasell wands in our hands: the godds poure leads, To beate backe their hawberds, to breake their owne heads. And where he alegith: that the spiders right: Is a safe warrant: with safe conscience to die, For all such spiders: as shall die in that fight, And that flies diyng therin: die damnably, That loude lustie lie: for a lie warant I. With safe conscience (in this case) corage a rise: To bale go all spiders: to blisse go all flies. The flies: vpon hering and doing of this, All stert vp, and stoode vp, most coragiouslie: With one voice all cride: sir captaine our mind is, To giue saute to the copweb euin by and bie. Wherwith: much more wilfullie then wittelie, (And yet not witlesse) into a ray they got, Marching toward the copweb, within goon shot, The watch towre strake a larum: thenmyes discrieng The goonners gaue fire: and first at raundon, thay: Shot of, the goonstones among the flies flying. Which gald the flies curstlie: cumming on the way. But foorth flying the flies now: as fast as they may. Without trenching: or such defensife forstalles, Ordnance they ley, to batter that castell walles. Great shot, and greuous slaughter of flies, there was Ere they could: anie peece of the walles batter: To make it sawtable, but so cam to passe: That in short time, that wall they did so shatter: That theyr waie laie playne, and streyght to the matter: (For which they cam. (they went. To such a fears fight, As neuer fought spiders and flies, in mannes sight. The flies geue onset in assawte vpon the castell: the spiders defending it in furious fighte. And vpon the slaughter on both sides, the flies retire to their campe. The spiders wife and childerne on knese to him beseching him to take peace with the flies. Cap. 66. In all battred brackes: flies rageing in a ranke, Ferslie flew in, all blacke as the cloudie skie. Spiders defending them. Spider nor flie shrancke, Hundreds strikin with gonnes, in peeses twentie. Theare a leg, here an arme, there a head doth flie. And peece from peece: by violence flowne round, A flight shoote a sonder, and as fer from ground. Both sides to se: so busilie occupide, With polaris, partisans, hawherds, billes goons: Trompets on both sides: ech tencoorage theyr side. The anoyans of the noise: thorough my head roons. The soonlesse flies fathers: the fatherlesse flies soons: With this thing, aboue all thing (a lacke alacke) Oh what wofull widow flies, go now in blacke. Thre quarters of an houre, this fight endewred. Which time, I imagined domes daie present. And that all the damd soules: had bene procured, To cum with the deuill thither: in his band hent. There to set vp hell, to suffer theyr torment. For dewring the time, I thinke no worldlie sight, More like hell, then was sight of that hellie fight. Terrour wherof, was to be witnessed well: To se so manie aliue so late, now dead. Thousandes setting on that copweb (with hart fell) Hang now there (like hearings in nettes) by the head. And spiders for their part: not scotfree lead: Here sum, and there sum, snacht vp a mid the rout: That were within halfe a houre a fore, full stout. At end of this fraie, no part saw cause to bost: Fiue thousand flies, and fiue hundred spiders sleyne. Wherwith the flies: seeing so manie flies lost, And of theyr purpose: could yet no part obteyne, At retret of trompet, they retyred a meyne. Where they before had campt. There to take a breath, To saue their honesti, and kepe them from death. The spiders were as glad to se the flies backes, As flies were to show them. For what time thay: (Beholding dead spiders) ech seeth his freend lackes, Few spiders (or none) saw cause to ioye that daie. The spiders wife: and childerne: nere dead in fraie: On knees besought him, in waie of petiscion, With the flies to take peace, on sum condiscion: The spider hauing compassion on his wyfe and childerne as on him selfe, he saith that he will: with the aduice of his councell, in their sute do all that maie be done for the best. Cap. 67. The spider: in hering of this theyr request, Seeing them in such feare: as he saw them there, That sight and hering, maie at first sight: be gest: In husband, and fathers: that anie zele bere, To their deare wiues: and swete babes, at iye and ere: The sight showth, and hering soundth such sight and sound, As maie their zelus harts, to death welnie wound. What kind harted husband: can se his kind wife, In like carefull case, without wo at his hart. What naturall father can se: for his life, His naturall childerne, in dread quake and start. Without his hart smarting, in most smartfull smart. I thinke, ye thinke none: and euin so thinke I. Meruell not then: though the spider be toucht nie. He tenderlie tendreth his childerne and wife: Refusing to stand vp: when he bad them rise, Till he wold graunt them (his grace) to stint this strife. His sight of feare in them: and furie in flies, Added his more perplexite: to deuise: To vse pittie to them: as nature draue him, And polisie to flies, as reason gaue him. To this: he saide my dere wife: and sweet babes two. Great weare the thing: by you of me desired: That I could denie, in what I can do. But for this treason, spightfullie conspired, And so put in vre: by flies now retired, Your sute therin: yf I should graunt out of hand, As the case standth: I dout how that graunt should stand. This case: touching me and all spiders most nie, In me and my counsell, shall forthwith be scand. Go in, and be cherfull: and feare not: but I, Wyll fauer and forder your sute: as maie stand: With most safte of vs, and all our whole band. They rose and made curtsie: forthwith whervpone, (They and he weeping) they (from him) thens are gone. The spider set with twelue of his counsaile, declareth his wiues and childerns sute (adioyning therunto c?cideracions of his owne) for peace to be taken with the flies. Requiring those counsellers (while he departe and returne) to determine what waie he shall take. Cap. 68. The spider: with his counsell, to counsell gat. The flies: flocking togither, as was then neede, In consultacion: full besilie sat, Eche side for them selues, best waie to se decreede. I gaue eare to both sides: to here them proseede, Stretching my memorie: to a double charge, To hold (vpon hering) both theffectes at large. And first: what I gathred on the spiders side. That shall ye haue: and then the talke of the flise. The spiders: at a bord: them selues did deuide, Six on thone: six on thother side. To deuise: (And diside, (such matter as should there arise. The head spider: in a cheyre at the boordes end, Entrith: as foloweth here after pend. Dere freendes: our present parell in wordes to dilate: It in deede: in hart felt: and at iye here seene, Should show follie. Our case is now to debate, Our best waie: to winde out of this daunger cleene: To stey our state, as before stayde hath beene. Wherin: betwene two things: I doutfullie dout, To which one: I shall vndoutedlie, stand stout. My wife and children: vpon their knees all three: With dead hartes: as death in their faces: did show, As I loue theyr liues: humblie be sought me, By some meane forthwith, to peace with flies to grow. For should they (said they) se the like ouerthrow: That they had sene: betwene our enmies and vs, Of theyr present deathes, they felt feling discus. This perplexth me: what one waie to take of twaine: Nature prokth me (in pitteing those three) To take peace with the flies, to ronne a maine. Reason prouokth me: politiklie to flee, The show of desire: in peace with flies to be. Which pittie to vse: and policie to refuse, How cruell flies will cock with vs, thats no newse. Now: on thother side: if I pittie omit, Nought weyng my wife: and ofspring in this case, But do bend vpon policie, euerywhit: To out face the flies: to stand face to face, And these three (by dread) to die in the meane space, Then am I double dead. Thone: that they death haue, Tother to se them die, whome my selfe might saue. I praie this whole boorde: this case first to reuolue, Eche in him selfe, and then all togither speake. Deuising your best. Wherin while ye resolue: Your full minds, to me (at my returne) to breake, Ile go, to cheere my wife and babes, wo and weake. They praide him to do so: which rang in mine eare, That they were more glad, to haue him thence then theare. Straight as the spider is gone, the rest arise withdrawing a sonder in three plumpes fowre in a plumpe, no one knot knowing what the rest saith, which done: thei all sit downe again against the spiders returne. Cap. 69. The spiders backe turnd, streight these twelue a rose By foure, foure, and foure, flocking into flockes three. Euerie flock talking, and standing togither close. Ech flocke vnto other (by ought I could se,) As strange, and as loth that their talke herd should be, As all could haue bene: that that spider that season, Should haue heard theyr talke, had they all talked treason. All showde one maner, which showd them all meeuid: Beating their fistes, beding their brows shaking their heads In feare and fewrie, all were greatlie greeuid, Talke of two: of which three flockes: whereto it leades, I could not yet know: softe wispring, not fer spreades. But talke of the third flocke (standing sumwhat nere,) Harkning sumwhat to them,) sumwhat did I here. Freendes (quoth one of those foure) we foure being one, We maie talke (and let vs talke) franklie our mindes. This spider (our ring leader) to his flocke gone, In debate of this case: to which he vs bindes, Is to me not vn geast: how he with vs windes. But first, not to teache: but to tell what he is, And then what he meanth here, here me saie in this. The spider is of wit, wonderus darke and deepe. And double as double, as he is deepe and darke. Loure where he loueth, laugh weare he hateth to creepe. To botum of bosum: for to spie what sparke, Kindled: with or against him, he maie there marke. Much for which purpose: he giueth vs now a bone, Of pittie: and pollisie, to gnaw vpon. But exept: we spice pittie and polisie both: As the sesoning maie sauer in taste to stand: As in his taste and sauer: sauerlie goth, He will gnaw our bones out of taste: out of hand. Which ye shall se: when I this scantlin haue scand, Betwene his politikelesse pittie (erst saide) And his pitteles polisie, (here erst laide) This dought: to bring out of dout, he hath vs set. Whether (by pitie) to saue his babes and wife: He shall seeke to flies: sum peace of them to get, Or by polisie: to stand stiffe still in strife, And leese: both his babes, and also his wiues life. First case: showing our daunger in generall, Last case: showing his daunger in speciall. This trap (not for mice) for spiders is baighted. To se what bit we bite: or on what string we harp. If this pittie here: be restreynd or straighted, And that (on his polisie) our tounges do carp: More to saue our selues: from daunger of deth sharp; Then to saue him and his, we plaing those parts, He wyll sure suspect, that we haue traytors harts. And if we leaue polisie: and pittie take: Concluding: that we will bide all Ieoberdie: Rather then see: of him or his: one finger ake, Ile hold a hunderd pound (to an halpenie) That he will take all that talke: for flatterie, Though his iye on vs therat pleasantlie pinke, Yet will he thinke, that we saie not as we thinke, These two: two edged cases: take I for such, That they maie be taken: a two edged swoord. Ech side of both cutteth, where euer it touch. But when we shall resolue: at yonder boord, Leaning these two waies: I haue deuisde a thoord. Wherwith, a tale he told them: so silently, That (tyll he told it at boord,) no woord herd I. But in taking end, I herd him to them saie: The spider will: our minds, seuerallie know. And I the yongest, shall speake first, (no naie.) And so ech other folowing: sitting a row. Wherin, as you in coorse to speake (after me) grow: Saye you: in this deepe case: vpon depe waying, Ye haue nought to saie, but taffirme my saying. And so shall we (sayde he) saue our four liues. They agreede. And to touch the second sort now, Auncients to the first, one of them four contriues: To conclude. In matter what: or maner how, From hearing I was yet kept (as I told you) But the talker to that flocke at end, spake out: These woordes. This way shal saue our four liues: no dout. Of the third and most auncient flocke likewise, One at end of his talke: these woords a loude spake. This waie shall saue our four liues. Or at least sise: Our honesties, and honest spiders vndertake: Life much rather: then honestie, to forsake. Ye saie truth (sayde the three) and we three a gree, With you to lese life, rather then honestee. O With this, they all at the boord sat downe againe. That they (at the spiders returne) might appere, Set as he left them: all as one to remaine. (While he went to (and came fro) his flock most dere.) Who (so finding them,) with sad and sobre cheere: Sat downe in his cheyre: Whare he had sit erst. And this prosesse to his purpose, promptlie perst. The spider set againe with his counsaile, in those three said sortes, arise thre diuers waies to take herin. The best one wher of to choose, the spider departeth to deuise vpon. Willing them to cause all corners of that castell to be clensed and all battred places made stronge againe. Cap. 70. As I told you I wold go, so haue I gone To comfort my wife and mine: in your names all. Assuring them: of your good hartes euerichone: To pittie and releue their dread. As may fall: In your most portable parell, cum what cum shall. Which hath (and nought els could (comforted them so, That quiet they harke to here, how thend shall go. Now: in case of pittie and pollici: erst leyde, Touching the two doughtes: which I was, and am in, I require fullie to here: what ye haue weyde. Wherin: your sentences seuerallie to win, You shall seuerallie speake: and the yongest begin. Wherewith that yongest (as he erst saide he wold,) In woords next folowing here, his tale he told. In these two cases: bulted, sifted, and fand, To sew for peace: in pittie of you and your, Or (by polisie) to war stiflie to stand. The doubtes debated here, in most might of our, Require this demaund: iudged in my most pour. Whether to take no peace, or what peace to take. Labor wherin, I thinke veyne: all that we make. If I be worthy in your counsell to liue, My counsell is: that all your studie shalbe: Not what peace ye shall take, what peace ye will giue: The flies being fraide: as much or more then we, Wyll not they seke for peace? yes I warant ye: Trust not my wit: except ye haue out of hand, Flies, sewing to take peace, as your wyll shall stand. Wherin: what your wyll shalbe ere the flies cum, Good is to dreme: to what point in peace to wade, And not when they cum: to stand muet or mum: In lacke of an answere (by you or yours made.) Nedefull haste in this case, doth me full perswade: From nedles hastie deuice: in thother cases: Both which (this taking place) they take no places. This (vnder your correction,) is my full mind. And mine (quoth the second) and mine (quoth the thurd.) And mine (quoth the fourth: quoth the fift) I am enclind, Of an other mind: then this tale hath now sturd. For two causes thone: for that this touchth no wurd: Of the case proponde, which is our charge to touch, Thother, for that I haue other matter tauouch. The pith of these two cases: I take to consist, Whether (by pittie: your fearfull flocke to saue,) We shall take peace with the flies: as the flies list, To our common daunger: by pride of flies braue) Or politicklie show: that we no peace wyll haue. To feare flies, and saue vs: yours and you: in parell. By their feare of warres continuall quarell. I hold: the best one waie of these both: to be, To saue your wife: and children: your sucsession. And therby you. For lacking you, what are we? Who can (like you) saue vs: from oppression? Our benefites (by you) enforce confession: For notable gouernance in gouernours, Neuer was felt our like gouernance: to yours, Your ofspring so toward: to rule after you: As you rule before them: to their erudicion: For our inestimable welth now, and after now. No spider hath the contrarie suspicion: But all spiders, in most humble submicion: Submit them whole to you: so loued or drad, As neuer was ruler, that euer spiders had. Our commoditees: woon by you: being huge, Huge were our losse likwise: by your being lost. You: and yours: appering here our whole refuge, Pittie: or policie: which shalbe the post: In this case to sticke to: my sentence bendth most, Ere daunger (by bread): to you or yours shall rise, To cleaue here to pittie, and take peace with flise. So say I (sayth second) of that second sort. And we saide the third (and fourth) which sayd: a none, The first of most auncient foure: his report Beginth. but fyrst: this tale last gone, He seemeth to commend (in part) where vpon, He showth his mynde. But fyrst (I saie) in woords fayer, He saith as foloweth next, of thys last sayer. Sayd (this saide auncient spider) this tale told last. Sumwhat to touch (vnder pardon) I entend. The tellers mind, I dispreyse in no part past. But in sondrie parts, I can hys minde commend. Namely: in that his mind is bent to defend: You and yours, from the death: as he ought to do. As fer as deutie deulie drawth, and we to. But as these two doutful daungers touch our state: From top to toe, (as wo saie: hie, meane, and low.) So: from brim to botom: them both to debate, In faithfull playne maner: (as in hert maie grow: All darke dissimilasion, to ouerthrow. Sotellie sounding to sence depraued, That trace shall I treade, vnder pardon craued. In these two tost termes: pitie, and policie, To turne and tosse, recitall: of this whole case, No nede. After recitall so sondrilie, The termes but namd, where memorie is most base: Remembraunce of the whole, those termes bring to place. Which pitie: is here aplide, to saue you and yours, And policie: here aplide, to saue vs and ours. Beseching you: and all you before I saie, Till all my saying be saide: iudge therin no part. But throughlie here me without stop or staie, And take in good part, my plaine trew meaning hart. Good tales: ill taken, may make the teller smart. But here, I praie hering. And hauing exprest, In folowing the effect, do as semth you best. But first: these two termes: pittie, and policie, (As I vnderstand them) here me, them define, Pittie: is an affect of all clemencie That doth alway: most clementlie encline, To haue regard, to remittible disipline. In matter of Iustice: or anie case els, All displeasant suffrance, pitie it expels. Policie: is the thing that circumspectly weithe. Wiselie (and warelie) to put things in vre. As resons ferdest fetch: in foresight purueithe, An ouer: rech aboue the weake wittes cure. So to put things in vre, that they maie endure: As no light blast of winde: do ouer blow them, Nor lacke of firme foundation, ouer throw them. And policie: (right taken (as I take it) In good part is taken, and construed euer. Policie: is not as sum spiders make it: Wittie wreched wile, that doth all indeuer: In wrongfull ill, to inuent to perseuer: The name of policie there, is to be last: And to be namd falshed: otherwise false craft. Pittie: wrong named, and wrong vsed also: Maie be and hath bene. As where it is aplide, To help one: or few, to the hurt of manie mo, The pittide part: being depe offenders tride, Thother part innosent. This (clere to disside:) Is either not pittie: or peuish pittie: Which (as thold saying sayith) marth the cittie. But the right vse of pittie is (as I gesse) To pittie part, as pittie maie pittie all: Without wrongfull hurt, anie one to oppresse. This meane I: in vse of pittie generall: But touching case (namelie yours) especiall, How it and such, from this generall case swarue, Shalbe touchit anone: as my meane wit maie sarue, But: policie, and pittie, pictured thus, I take man and wife. and temperance (as who saie) Minister in this mariage, I discus. Knitting this cupple: in stedie stinted staie, Policie to commaunde, and pittie to obaie. Policie her husband: and pittie his wife, Politicklie to kepe al, from pittelesse strife: Where policis maie bring pittie: promptlie plaste, That husband will not keepe that wife: out of place: And that wife (that husbands assent not purchaste,) Will not presume to take place, both to disgrace: Her husband: and also her self to deface: Thus policie and pittie: in case generall, Ioyne (for common welth) in common gouernall. But now: to grow toward specialitee, Where I laide misuse of pittie before: To stand: in not pitteing generalitee: By pitteing the lesse nombre before the more, Though that rule: leane rightlie to the right shore: In case of pittie: much misusde generallie: It maie (and doth) feyle: in sum case speciallie, Sum thre or four: are in pittie to be weide: More, then sum other three or four thousand are, In sondrie cases: which policie doth eide. Namelie, and properlie, now here to declare: In perticuler case, of your present care. To saue vs and ours, and leese you and yours, Or leese you and yours, and saue vs and ours. The losse of foure thousand of meane spiders now: Touching daungerous disturbance of the state, Were lesse losse then were you foure: and chieflie you. But the losse of the whole corps, of vs to rate: With losse of you four: the most losse to debate. This case: to our case: presentlie directed, Is nedelesse: or bootelesse, to be respected. Needlesse I take the talke: as in this respect. Fyrst our case rechith not: determinatelie: To deth of you, or vs, but it doth direct: A dread of deth in yours: and in you therby. Or daunger of death in vs: not deth clerly: But dread: or daunger of deth: and deth out right, Are oft (and now I hope) fer distaunt in sight. Yours in dread, and we in daunger, of deth much: All may be brought: and deth yet folow no whit. Neither in yours, nor ours. And this case is such, As if ye will therin: policie admit. To out face flies, the corps of spiders to knit: In coragious countenance, then shall ye se, The flies in feare, and your feare nedlesse to be, As the talke is nedlesse: to compare the losse: Of vs all, with you four: for none shalbe lost. And other wise, bootelesse, in this talke to tosse: In matter on this side or that side to bost. The most or least losse: for all least and most: Shall die. yf ye shrinke and seke peace, flies will none. Then we being fyrst slayne, you and yours are gone. Will they slea vs and saue you, seeing this war: Against you: is chieflie or onlie begon? Naye make ye sure. Ye are the principall bar: Or beame, in their iyes: as the quarell doth roon, Wherin, I perceyue no way: ought to be woon, But politiclie tencorage all our whole rout, A fresh a gainst the flies, in ray to stand stout. We in corage, out of corage the flies are. And we out of corage, in corage are they. We spiders presing forward, back the flies bare. Spiders drawing back, foorth prese flies without stey. Thus ye se: policie here must make the waie, If anie way maie be made, by possible pours: To preserue all, both you and yours, vs and ours. This: vnder pardon of you and yours: erst praide: Is: both my conscience, and my counsell playne. And mine (quoth the next of the three) with him steide. And like wise ours also (quoth those other twayne.) The spiders outward wordes, showd show to retaine: All their sayings: and all a like: to like well. But how he likte inwardlie, I could not tell. But: on these three diuers tales: a part to muse, Which one to take: or which to leaue of all three, He said he wold (and did) depart to peruse. Willing them in meane time, an order to see. That castell in warlike case, againe to bee. Wherevpon he: to his inner mansion gone, To the soudiers spiders, they went a none. To whom, that most auncient spiders repeated: Such part hereof, as was meete for them to here. But first, he inuented in that he treated: To encorage them all, to be of good chere. And pluck vp their harts, if flies againe march nere. Matter of which rule such: and the tale so told, That it brought the spiders againe, brag and bold. Then entred he: into repeticion, Of c?maundement giuen, for that sort renuing. For clensing and strengthing: in ech condicion, As it was, before former saute in vewing, The parell of a second saute, eschewing: To ley downe their wepons: and set to their hands, To scour: and to repeire, all there, that in nede stands. The whole nombre (sauing reserued to watch) The watch in the watch towre: and vpon the walls,) Ley by their weapons: ech one his place to catch: To strengthin weake places, ech one to worke falls. Stronglie they stop vp, al goon hole galls. All places spide: in anie kinde of fauting, Made stronge in defence of a second sauting. The dead spiders they buried: in the castell closse, The dead flies hangd out in Iebets openlie. But to se the spiders: how they turne and tosse: Sum making of graues: sum the spiders burie: Sum making iebets: sum hangin flies on hie: Sum spinning threeds: to repeir that castell wall. I neuer saw the like, nor I think neuer shall. Which: while they bring in pre estate, now to here; What the flies (in commun counsell (not priuate) Be in deuising: what waie maie best a pere: On their part, eche partie to saue his owne pate. They: being set in counsell: it to debate: In a troope: be side the reformacion tree, Thorder and thend folowth here, to here and se. The flies in campe be at cownsell: desirously deuising: by what meane to get peace best. Whervpon the captaine inuenting a meane to driue th?t to sew for peace if thei will be ruled by him, thei thervnto agree. And thervpon the ant is brought before the flies. Cap. 71, The flies discoragid (as erst disclosed,) They all cride to take peace sum maner of waie, A warfare to fare: that fare them disposed: Rather to fast, and to fare full hard (that day:) Then sharp sauts, with sowre sawse: to taste more in safe, Their bumbling buzing: at their capteyns crie sest, This aduised aduice, to them he exprest. Freendes all: that ye all wolde haue peace, ye all show, But what waie to cum to peace, none of you tell. Two pleyne waies theare be, to prouoke peace to grow, One: to submit vs on knees (to our foes fell,) An other, to offer them talke, war to expell. By taking peace: vnder condiscion such, As maie extinkt (in both partes) all cause of gruch. But first: yf we submit vs, all are vndoone. Meane mercie, nay mayne miserie: shalbe our end, Flies knees: to furious spiders, win no boone. The seconde, and the best waie is, to extend: Sum talke as I tolde: which if ye condisend: To folow, we must enter talke in the same: By sum other bye meane: then in our owne name, If we sew directlie, spiders wilbe prowde. And we eyther get no peace: or such a peace, As betwene war and that peace, small choyse a vowde. Exactions, raunsums, or fines, shall neuer cease, Bonds of good abearing: shall haue no release. Flies lands, flies goods, flies liues, and flies liberte, Manie clearlie lost, and all in ieoberde, But you folowing (as ye ought) my counsel, I wyll driue thant to make sute: this sute to sew: By a tale told to him here. Which I will tell: If ye will here it and soth it, the flies grew: To a gree. Wherewith certaine flies for thant flew, Who: fet and set at ladder foote by the flise, The Captaine (to thant:) did this tale deuise, The captaine telth the ant that the flies haue retired from thassaute: (wheare manie spiders are slayne) to se whether the spiders wyll sew for peace, for which since they sew not, the flies will assaute them agayne. But the ant they wyll hang streyght before they go, Cap. 72, Ant (pleyne and trew, short and sharp) a tale of me: Told to thee, thou must here. Thus standith the case. A great conflict (euin now) the spiders and we, Haue had: which slew spiders a piteous pace. Tyll pittie wrought our retire, to se what grace: Might a pere in them: to sew to vs for peace, In giuing vs our right, this war to sursease. And: that they do vs wrong intolerable, I durst make thee (their frend) our iudge (for my part) The abhominacion is enscrewtable: To pronounce at full, how they (by will peruart,) Haue wrongfullie wroong vs, to wronges of most smart. Which we haue borne: and neuer theron wrokun, Till the burden, our backs and necks hath brokun. And when we hope (if we at anie time hope:) That our breakbacke burdens: shall cum to ende, Then showth thencrese of our burdens: so large scope, That they seme but be goon. None end sene tentende. Wherin, their force forsith vs, to band in bende. Rather: then bide their perpetuall shakling, To stand agaynst them, and stick to our takling. As we haue stikt now here (I saie) to their payne. And to avoide their more payne (I say and sayde:) Being loth: to set a broth their blood againe, We haue traynd a long time (endiffrentlie weyde:) To kepe them: from thextreme extremite stayde, To se their sewt for peace: vs to peace tatempt. Which: thorow their owne faut, (we saie) is exempt. But since they sew not, we will set on a gayne. To leaue no spider (or els no flie, a liue. But ere we go: we haue made decre certaine: To hang thee streight. Ant: it booteth not to striue, Get a gostlifather: that can shortlie shriue. Dispatch hangman. Sum flie go: sum bell to toule. That spiders and flies, may praie for thants soule. The Ant vpon soden shorte warning of his death: beynge much dismayde, laying all that he can for his life, and yet can get no grace, he prayth respight: while he be brought to the spider to se whether he wyll grow to anie peace to saue the antes life. Whiche graunted, the ant is brought before the spider. Cap. 73. Neuer was there ant, (I wene) so astonide: As was this ant vpon this chiefe flies tale told: Had he bene an ant plenteouslie monide, He wold haue geuen sacks full of siluer and gold: To haue bene safe thens, but he preide them to hold: And heare him speake once againe before he die. Which graunted, this began the ant by and bie. Maister Captaine (and all (my maisters) here flise:) I besech you consider, consideratlie. Not onlie: that none enmite doth a rise: In me toward you: proued aprobatlie, Before nor since my suffrance, captiuatlie: But frendship in aduising you peace to kepe, Wheare war hath sins, brought manie flies in dead flepe. Also to vewe: I humblie you instant, What time ye haue hangd me, what thing ye haue woon. The carcas of a poore wretched seelie ant. Not worth the rope that it hangth by: in the soon. Way well (with your selues) what a threede this were spoon An innosent: by tiranie: to death to draw, No flie therby winner, the worth of a straw. Note more: this thing once done, can neuer be vndoone. And till it be doone, maie be doone when ye will. Which being now doone: and repented as soone, To late cumth that repentaunce: to auoyde thill. Marke more. If you in this furie: me here kill, Then the feyre flowre of flies (as ye take him) dieth, As from the spider, thretning therin erst lieth. Quoth the captaine turne the ladder: thant cride stay. If all this aforesaide: my life will not saue, Here this deuice: deuised an other way. That is: it maie like you: I your graunt to haue: Of one poore petission, which I last here craue. Let me go: gardid to the spiders againe, To proue: what peace I can for my life, obtaine. Beete so cride the flies: who made a harold go: To make most humble sute: in behalfe of thant, That he and (saue fortie flies with him) no mo, Might be admitted to his speche: that instant. The spider (seming to graunt it: hard and scant,) Bad him cum. Wherwith awaie the harold went, Showing the flies and ant, the spiders assent. Fortie flies garding the ant, flew forth brauely. The spiders fort, renewde and furnisht agayne. The hed spider in the mids: standing grauelie: And (for terror) on Iebets and galows remaine, Flies thousands hanging: sum in rope sum in chaine. Thant: being brought before the spider to speake His minde (as folowith) forthwith he did breake. Thant (in waie of peticion) sewinge to the spider for peace laying consideracions to prouoke him the rather therto, the spider doth attentiuelie, geue the ant hering, Cap. 74. Ryght exelent hunkill, if I wofull wretche: To call you mine vnkill: may here be so bold, Two things: to pronounce playnlie without fer fetche, Is my present purpose. First of which doth hold: Thankes, for sauing my life. Seconde to be told, Standth vpon a request by petiscion: For parell, like the first in condiscion. As thus: of life: I am in like daunger now, As I was then. (except your mercifull eyde:) The flies: being bent to liue and die on you, To sawt this castell a fresh, they haue purueyde. And had bene here ere this: sauing that they steyde: To hang me first, which hath no longer stay: But till I (of peace) bring them word, yea, or nay. Nowhit at their sute: but all togither at mine. They respight my life: till my returne: to trie, What good lucke: your good loue, to me may a sine: By enclinacion to peace, charitablie: At my sute, for my sake. Both to saue therby, My life: and as manie of yours: as shall, In this feerce force, be clapt in the necks withal. And since: your owne estate ye can better wey: What waie is best: (for you and yours) then I can, And that ye know: the worst peace: (as wise wights sey:) Is better then is the best war, to scan, As profe showth partlie here, since this war began: This considered: considering of your part here, I leane of to consider mine owne part clere. Fyrst: beseching you with me, and for me new, To consider: I am in this parell brought, By my selfe, for my selfe, naie by you for you: Without my seeking: by your owne request wrought, And stinted reward, coruptlie to be bought, None ye offred, none I axid, nor none I haue: Nor none I sought: but your fauer to vowsaue, Secondarilie: your case erst arbitrated: I forthered: (as fer as my wit might force pour:) Which showde so, when I the same Iterated, That I had woordes of thanke: from the mouth of your. Thirdlie: where chaunce of war: was to me so sour: That I (for you) was captiue and should haue dide, What (and how) things grew theron, here them specifide. At the flies first approch: toward this assaut, To a tree they drew me: streight to hang me there. Axing of me, or laying to me: no faut, But that I was your freend. In which deadly fere. One flie: erst at tharbiterment (as other were.) I prayd to speake, that I might speake ere I dide. Which was at last graunted: but fyrst long denide. My tale there, stood on two entents in effect. One: to saue mie selfe, an other to saue you; And yours. And therin to scape vnsuspect. First for my selfe, I layde that no flie could avow: That euer I offended flie: ere now or now. Praing them (thervpon) to here and adiudge me, As might most equallie stand with equite. And for the saftie of you: and of yours here: To qualifie the feerce furie of the flies, All trembling terror: that I could make apere, That might discorage the flies: in anie wise, That did I at the full: to the flies deuice. Which wrought such effect: and did their harts so pall, That they cride for peace: and wold haue fled ny all. But the cheefe flie steying them: then against me, Spake his pleasure theare, as you did after here. He saw and saide to the flies: that they might se: My counsell giuen them, was against them clere. And that I put them in feare to cum here mere: Onlie for the loue: that I to spiders bare, And to set my selfe at liberte, from flies snare. Whervpon he moued, and they did consent: That I shuld be sent hither as sent was I, To tell a tale, to abate your furie bent. Wherin: if I brought you all as fearefullie: To feare them: as I had brought them formerly: To feare you, then should I be set frank and free. Or els (at my returne,) hangd streyght should I bee. Here: to prolong my life, nature prouokt me: To make you afraide of them, sumwhat to saie. But yet againe to that: affection yokt me To reason so fayntlie, when that I did inuey, That you (by reason) streight wiped that feare away. For which, I was no soner returnd vnneth, Ere I had (at the flies handes) iudgement of deth. Fyrst at your request, for you: and not for me: I cam: crauing no reward: but your good will. Second: in tharbitrate case I wrought decre, To the best for you. As fer as I could skill, Thirdlie, for your sake: to death most vile or ill, I was then drawne: and am now drawing againe. Except my greese: sum grace, of you obtaine. That is: that it maie like you, to flies to graunt, Peace. Such as dispaire giue no cause to refuse, And pride giue no cause, it proudlie to auaunt. But as mesurable meane: measure endewse: So (of your grace) graciouslie them to vse. This loue toward my life: please it you to show, No reward els (at your handes) craue I to grow. This endid: the ant made curtsey to the ground. At which the spider gaue him a beck low boude. But: before he anie woord: to thant did sound, He pawsde solemlie, as any spider coude. Which doone: verie louinglie: but not verie loude, In maner assewred. And in woordes right graue, First thentre: and then thend of answere he gaue. The spider (vpon thants tale tolde to him) alegith certaine thinges by which he semeth in doubte much to graunt peace to the flies. Wherin the ant and he trauersing sum what: anon he graunteth peace to them vnder condicion exprest, wherewith thant is brought to the flies agayne. Cap. 75. Cosin ant: a long matter in short speeche here, Ye haue (as ye can) right wiselie declared. Which: as ye grounded on three things to apere, To draw me to pittie you, in case thus snared, So: this mine answere to those three prepared: Hath in it: other three thinges. Two of which three, Stand sore agaynst ye: and the third standth with ye. First the harme (by wrong) that flies haue doone me. Second: my will to be reuengde on the same. Third: the pittie I haue of you. I promise ye: Of two thinges: betweene these three: which one to name, I can (as yet) no determinacion frame. Which is: one of these two: to determin at eende, Whether to slea all my foes, or saue one freende: Naie: whether to slea or to saue: foes and freend both, And whether to slea or saue: both you and yours, On this question (quoth thant) this case rightlie goth: But peace sauith them and theirs: vs and ours. War sleath (or daungerth) all: in short sharp showrs. Ye saue all: in pitteing me: the least one, Not pitteing me, ye slea (as semth euerychone. But two of your three points last toucht: here me touch, Omitting the third, till I them haue touched. Of your harme: your will to reuenge: as ye a vouch:) To thone ill past: thother ill to cum, couched: When all is reuoluid, that can be a vouched. Your reuengement to cum: of the flies ill past, May bring you more harme: and the flies away cast. Yea: cast you and yours awaie to, (I say) it may: And (vnder your pardon) to speake my minde plaine, Your desire of furder reuengment: to way, Declarth much crewelte: in you to remaine. The least flies raunsum hath bene losse of his braine, That in time past hath toucht here: and now in sight, Thousands of flies slaine, and hangd in present fight. Thus for their yll, and your will: thill to reuenge: Your pointing of those two points: dispoynted be. In that quarell: charitee doth you chalenge: In deadlie defiance: of all enmite. Then passing these two points, to this thyrd pas we. Pittie: wherby charitee here to enbrase, Aboue all cases, pittie this pitefull case. And pittie: in you showde here now vnto me, Commodite to your selfe: I thinke shall gaine. If you (in this respect of pittie) agre: To take peace with the flies, though ye losse sustaine: My life to saue: in recompence of my payne: Hands and harts of Ants: old and yong: great and small, To serue you in your neede, ye are sure of all. And contrariwise: if I here now go to wracke, Where you shall me slea: in that ye maie me saue, Not onlie freendship: of all ants ye shall lacke, But all creaturs liuing: shall you depraue: And abhor. where they: speech or thought of you haue: Agaynst you (in this case) least mite in a cheese, In his most might: will fight, in blood to his kneese. To this (all that I can saie) what ye will do, I humblie beseche you (foorthwith) to declare. Life, or death, which one of two to trust vnto, Is my deepe desire. That I maie now prepare, My stomacke redie, according to my fare. My minde I meane to die: or els to liue, As your pleasure is, my death or life to giue. Cosin ant (quoth the spider (pittie toward you: And anger toward them, wreastleth in me sore. The flies spight to spiders: to show what and how: They haue spighted vs: from long before: Laying their fauts on our backs. and euermore: By clayming our commons and such other like, Slaundring our titles: quarels still they pike. Sir (quoth the flie) fauts on both sides I haue herd, Which on both parts, I wish to be mendid. The next waie wherto, is peace to be preferd. By war, no part mended, all parts offended. War wasteth all things: where war is thus bendid. In pittie wherof, by peace all ils to mende, Peace to all parts: I wish still an ende. Well cosin: cheefelie: yea onlie for your sake: In recompence of your pains: at my desire, Pardon I geue flies: and peace thus shall they take, I will all flies, out of hand hence to retire. And that they in tumult, no furder conspire. But that they cleare dissolue this conspirasie, And euerie flie flee home, to liue pesablie. They shal now: set you at liberte also Bag, and bagage: to go streight home franck and free. And in this window and all, (wheare my powrs go:) Half the hooles for theirs, I graunt to them fro me. And the flie that this began, still here to be. Standing vpon his triall in consequence, As standth with reason, law, custome, and conscience. Which (as I promised him, (I will performe. This is your end. And flies warne your felowes flise: To be ware henceforth, of these deeds enorme. And by their harme here present, to war so wise: That thei neuer atempt more, thus to arise: Against their beggers or betters: such as bee, Placed thus, aboue flies in auctoritee. Great god saue you (quoth thant) quoth those flies amen. Low curtsie they made, and awaie they flew: To the camp of flies: and there and then, Presenting thant to them, aboute thant they drew. With panting harts. To perceiue, what wold ensew. Wherewith: the ant at curtsie with knees low boude, These sweete wordes he began, in voyce right loude. Thant declaring peace: as it is graunted, the flies in muche ioye set the ant thankfullie at libertie, and home goeth be. Whervpon the captaine commaundeth all flies to draw nere to here him speake ere they depart. But they flee all awaye a few excepte. Cap. 76. Peace: and pardon: I bring now into your laps. Upon these wordes spok?, there was such a shril showte Holding vp their hands: casting vp their caps, Such ioying and reioysing: the whole campe aboute: As selde hath ben heard and seene, in such a route. Long was it: ere silence wold fullie be woon. But at last it was woon: which doone thant begoon. Peace to pronounce, in forme as it was graunted. And that it was graunted onlie for his sake. When he at end (to them) had it a vaunted, And that he: of his gard thither: did witnesse take: They all of the same: affirmacion did make. Streight waie: the halter taken from the ants necke, The captaine flie gaue thant, a louelie low becke. Praying him: to let all hard handling past, pas. And to consider: that in nombre so greate, All be not one flies broode: and wo he was, That he had showde him selfe so ill: him tentreate. Desiring him, it to forgiue, and forgeate. (Sir quoth thant) forgiuen and forgotten, all is: For my part, and euer shalbe after this. And such flies as erst, had frowninglie faste him: Louinglie they then, on him did smothlie smile. The captaine and cheef flies: hauing embraste him, They geuing him thankes, in wordes of pleasant stile: Discharging him thence, I let him passe a while: Most iocund and ioyfullie: homward to flee, While ye: the flies conclusion haue by me. The ant being gone, the captayne forthwith: Made proclamacion, to be herd there saie. But thousands (after hundreths) are gone euin sith. Till all: within fortie, weare flowne quight awaie. The rest, most agaynst their will: forst to this fraie, Gathering aboute the captayne: to heare him speake, He to them: and they to him, their minds did breake. Upon a litle talke had betweene the captaine and the few flies there lefte, touchinge the rewdnesse and lightnesse of the common sort of flies, misliking their former light lewde demenure, they depart. The campes on both sides, clere brooken vp. Cap. 77. How like ye this rudenesse of these flies (quoth he?) As yll as anie sight I haue seene (quoth one) Well (quoth an other) it is no nouelte: Common sort of flies (in maner euerichone) As gidds cum and go, so flies cum and are gone. Oftimes when striuis are (by wrangling flies) begoon, In the mids of the matter, awaie they roon. Leauing flies in the briers: whom they forst therto, As they forced me. But I am this time tought: Agaynst an other time: what I shall do. And we (quoth other) thither forsiblie wrought. My mind (quoth the captaine) was to haue brought: Our campe in order disolued. Sir (quoth one) Ye know they that know none order, can keepe none. I told at first (those flies that forst me out) Though I tooke (as I tooke and take) our clayme right: Yet agaynst our superiors, to be stout: To attayne our right: by force of furious fight, A blinde flie might se that out of the waie quight. Which wold not be heard: but ere I agayne stur: As I now sturd, Ile be hangd at mine owne dur. And we (quoth the rest). Freendes (quoth the captaine) I was not forst at beginning: to cum foorth. I rather foreced other: but to be plaine, The gayne in this io:ney seene: what it is woorth, And what daunger this and like enterprise stoorth Ile not stur thus agayne, if I maie sit still: And foorst to stur thus, Ile stur with an ill will: Better smoth woordes to geue: then smart stripes to take, Namelie where stripes win nought: &amp; wordes maie win all, Against the streme, strife againe I will not make. But take at spiders hands, as in peace may fall. I se what it is: to spurne against the wall, Home will I in peace, and in peace a bide there, Wishing peace thinstrument, right to trie eche where. We wishe the same (saide the rest) all taking flight: From thence: nothing theare left: but themptie place, Wherevpon: the spider, brake vp his camp quight. Which done, I sterted vp a speedie pace. Looking out at the window: there to purchace: A sight (yf I could) of the ant: cume home new, What solem salutasions, should there ensew. Thant being cum to his molehill: solemlie reseiued of hys wife, and childerne, and a great numbre of ants, he telth (to them all a tale discoorsinge theffect of all his trouble, had amonge he spiders &amp; flies, willing them diligentlie to marke, what he sayth. Cap. 78. Out at a lates hole, castinge mine iye, A molhill I spide: as the emerod greene. The grasse low leyde: and vnto the window nie, Thant new entring the same: who when he was seene, On so soden warning, neuer was (I weene) Such a nombre of ants, as were on that hill. To show outward tokens, of inward goodwill. At thants first entre, a lane of ants was made. Euerie ant by the waie, shaking that ants fist. And sumwhat more then the midwaye of that glade, His wife met him: whom he full sweetlie kist. His babes fell on knees. Whom he deuoutlie blist. Whervpon: all ants hauing that ant imbraste, These wordes saide he to them: amid mong them plaste. Dere kinsfolkes: and alies manie: and freendes all. What ye haue herd of me: sins I from you went, That know I not. But my selfe here report shall: Of my trobulus tragidie, theffect feruent. In telling which tale, mine effectuall entent: Is: that ye all shall now marke much: what I saie: And all marke much more, whie I saie: that I saie. But what I saie: mark first. I thinke ye know all: That my yong cosin spider was with me here: To cum to his father: my hunkle: at call, But the cause wherfore he wild me to appere: Whether ye know or not: that know I not clere. My knowledge wherof: to witnes that ye know, In full and few woordes, (as I can) I shall show. A notable flie: hath late chaunsed to light, In that spiders copweb. the spider by that, Charging the flie: with desert of death: by right. The flie: to deserue to die, denying flat. Beseching the spider, to here him speake sumwhat. He graunting him speeche. and to iudge his offence, Stending with reason, law, custome, and conscience. The spiders chalenge to the flie, gaue great charge. Wherto (as fer as I could there vnderstand, The flies defence, was very lusty and large. In which chalenge and defence: when all was scand, To cum to ende, they two could not take in hand. But being dreuen to choose arbiters tagre, The flie choose a butterflie, the spider chose me. This one: of their manie matters farbitrate. At triall (by custom) on which side to lay, All holes, in that and all windows in eche state. The flies claiming freehold: for free passing way. The spiders for spiders saide: so, all hold they. Wheron: we hering all sides what could be leide, We could not agree, how the case might be weide. To anie one side of both: so that at ende, In our report, (to that spider and that flie,) The case as we first founde, we left it to depende. The spider and flie in copweb: thend to trie, Whervpon the flies: in a fume by and bie, Were sodenlie vp: in a rought, on a rore. Such a flock, as I haue neuer seene before. No nede to aske them wherfore their cuming was, Their warlike fashin: showde them bent to fight: But in a moment, a bout me they compas. And without worde of cause declarde, wrong or right. They drew me to a tree: standing nie in sight. Wheare: with halter aboute my neck: on ladder set, Turne the ladder they cride, none other glace to get, Sauing the forsayde arbiter butterflie, Upon great and longe sute, at last obteynde. Of them to here me speake: before I shoule die. But ere I spake (what to speake) seeing vnfaynd Life or death lie before me,) I was constraind: (As that short time wolde serue) to premeditate, How to conserue my selfe, and the spiders state. As affection naturall: moued me more: To leane to the spiders: then toward the flies, And of my tale: the verie carnell or core, Must stand on two points (me thought in anie wise. Thone, to perswade no faute in me to surmise: Against them. Thother to make them to relent, By enforsing the force, of spiders force bent. In first part of which tale, my fautes I clered: That they (to touche me with) could anie waie laie. And where: by the reste of my tale, appered, Their deaths plaine: (as I there fooes force did displaie.) They thervpon all: welnie conning awaie I handling the tale so, from first part to eende, That the most part (simple flies) tooke me their freende. But the craftie flie: capitall captiteyne, Opening (to the flies) my politik intent, Unseene to the flies: till he made them se it plaine, Him selfe seeing his daunger aboue all bent, If the flies did flee, their flight then to preuent, He inueyde such matter to them: that a none, He coraged them to stand, all former feare gone. Whervpon: with their consent, he awarded, That I: before the spiders, a tale to tell, Should be sent forwith, with fortie flies garded. Wherin: if I made spiders feare flies: as well: Or as much (in my saying serius or fell:) As I brought flies of spiders before in feare, I should go quight. Yf not, at returne hang theare. I sayde I wolde do my best. and therwithall, Standing on the ladder, my two winges stert out. As in a time of our time, is naturall. Which had: I flew garded with this garded rout, Before the spider, hauing looke straunge and stout. But what of that: my curtsie ons low made, I vsed wordes: my matter to perswade. Where: although I wolde haue told an other tale: Yet who maie not as he will, must as he maie. Life was sweete, death was sowre: nature did me hale To saue my life, while my life in my tounge laie: Short tale to make, in tale so did I there saie: That spiders in feare of flies, had agony As much, as flies of spiders had formerly. Wherwith: the hed spider fell in fell furie. I feard he wold (with his wepon) haue kild me: And suer: all my frendes from Iersey to Iurie: Had not saued my life: but he wolde haue spild me: Had not his fore graunt: waranted and wild me: To cum and go safe, but this passing ouer. He entred a talke, the spiders to recouer: And encorage agayne. Which in fine he did. Bringing me in much disdayne, and more distrust. He saide, that one both those parts, I disemblid. Creeping with spiders: at times when I lust, And flieng with flies: othertimes, euine as Iust. Where I to him, ment nothing but honestlie. He reported my meaning, cleane contrarie. Ensampled, by my creeping with spiders furst: And last exampled: by my fleeing with flise. In reste of his tale told, he telling the wurst: Against me and my tale: that he could deuise, He such matter layde, and layde it in such wise, That in corage (I saie) were the spiders agayne. We with his defiance, returning a mayne. To the flies: by one flie: all past repeated, Which: declaring me: the spiders to haue frayde, As I was wild to do, streyght was it treated: (Upon demaund) whether in that I there saide, I should haue my life or not. which to be waide: Betwene two flies: a serius argument: Whether I should liue or die, was biglie bent. The one saide: that I by cumnant, ought to liue, Nai saide thother: by cumnant he ought to die: The first saide: as wordes of cumnant do giue: To bring the spider in feare, euine so did I. Thother said, that feare heeld not permanentlie And: the woordes fulfild: the meaning not fulfild, The cumnant is not kept. In iudgement well skild, This argument they turnd and tost till at last, The freend, quight ouerthrew thaduersarie. And yet against me, the most nombre streight past. As though thargument had ron, cleane contrarie, On the ladder I stoode, streight to miscarie: From which: at turning of, by the flie hangman, Hold: cride a flie fer of, flinging toward vs than. Which flie saide: the spider had made a decree: The flie in close prison with him deteynde: Should streyght leese his life, if the flies did kill me: Whervpon they repryede me to prison cheynde. With harnest flies watcht: and in stocks remeinde. Betwene hope and dread, whether to liue or die, As this side, or that side, should win victorie. Forthwith herewith, on the spider they gaue saute. Where fiue hundreth spiders: and fiue thousand flies, Weare slaine. Abating on bothe sides corage haute, The flies retired: peace sum waie to deuise. The spiders: weare desirus of peace, likewise. But which part should begin sute: that peace to moue, Both parts showde as much curtsie, as litle loue, The flies had me before them braging in bost. That sins spiders to them: for peace wold not sew, Spiders: or flies one part of both should be crost: Quight out of this life, none left a liue to vew. And streyght to the ladder, agayne they me drew. Protesting that I should die: ere they marcht thence, I praying them, my lyfe might hang in suspence. While I weare garded againe, to the spider. To sew to the spider, all in mine owne name. To see: of what peace, hap might be prouider. At mine humble sute: vnto him for the same, They graunted, and sent me. to whome when I came, I sewde for peace. beseching it the rather, For certeine respects, which I then did gather. Such as showd then: hie time: peace to giue and take. As: daunger to him and his: and then for me: Most Innosentlie cast awaie, for his sake. Hauing, or looking, for no comodite: But onlie his fauer: and hereupon he: (Seming loth to graunt: and glad to graunt in deede, Graunted peace, in forme as forwith shall proseede. Under generall pardon: for all fautes past, The flies must all awaie: and all war sursease. I: set at liberte: no longer to lie fast. Flies in windowes, to haue halfe the holes in pease, The flie with him in prison, not to release: But to take an end at his hands. theare or thence, As standth with reason, law, custom, and conscience. But note: I must take this done all for my loue. In recompence of paine and parell had theare: This done, I and the flies theare, as did behoue: Geuing thankes: and taking leaue, thence gone we weare: To the flies, who flockt about me geuing eare: To here of peace. Which when I theare had declarde, With thanks I was discharged, of all captiue garde. From whens I am (as you se) hether now cum. The one halfe of my whole tale: hauing displayde. For: of what I haue to saie: this is the sum. But now wherfore this what (now saide) is saide: As I: at beginning wild this what: well waide, So wyshe I this wherefore: to be wayd as well, For saftie of all ants, which I shall now tell, Thant hauing said: what he wolde saie, willeth all ants to note whie he said, that he saide. Whiche is to warne them by his armes to beware, how they meddle in matters betweene spiders and flies. Cap. 79. VVyse ants are warnd: by other ants harmes (ants say) And you: auoiding your harms: by harms of mine, The whie: of my former tale, ye then well way. For of the what, that is the whie: in fine. Your heareing and following: of which displine (With heareing and folowing: my next wordes here set,) Defence fro my like harms, I hope ye shall get, My which harms: though they show outwardlie to grow: By warres froward chaunce: without faut of mine owne. Yet the high god knowth, and my conscience doth me show: That these my harms, of these my two fauts are growne. Pride, and couetousnesse: by corrupt blast blowne. Into my hart inculked: by fancie fonde, Which to warne you of, Ile make you vnderstonde. Though the spider sent for me: ere I hence went, Yet when I was sent fore, proude was I to go: Wheare: I thought to grow: in state more exelent, Then anie ant before had growne and so: Pearking with spiders: in top of the windo, I thought there: with the spiders equall to be, And here, in anthils, ants a god should take me. And for the mayntenance: of that proude estate, I couetouslie cast, what way to finde meane. Being aboue all ants, in place situate, By preferment (at the spiders hand,) to gleane. Office, fee, all that I could, to gather vp cleane. Low curtsie, great riches, mirth, ease, loue, and laude. I thought all should be offred, me to a plawde. But in fine, this was the frute of this vaine hope: Loue, or laude, on no side: on all, hate and blame. For goldin cheine at my necke, an hempen rope. For reuerence and prayse, disdayne and defame. Looking to win much, lease all. As in the same: Showd my reward: at end of all, at hands all. Namlie at spiders hands, who did me thither call. As he: in graunting peace to the flies, showde plaine. Which peace he saide, (I saie) with flies he did take, To saue my life, and to recompence of my payne. And for no cause els. But let vs here make, As it in deede: had bene done all my sake. Yet: the hed and taile of this tale: Ioyned nie, Shall show: that I right nought did win therby. What yf: to saue my life, that peace he then gaue: My life was out of parell: till I came theare, Brought by him: for him, to the brinke of my graue, Had I kept me here, neither parell nor feare: Had my hart wounded, as it did theare while eare, This gift is like as if a theefe (by false traine,) Robd me of my good, and gaue it me againe. I lost my time theare, and I lost my thrift here, In somer (ye know) we ants worke busilie: For winter to prouide, our foode euerie yere. But: lack of this somers dayes diligentsie, May make me fast two dayes in winter (happlie,) And driue me (perhaps) ere winter all done be, To beg of ants, that might els haue beggde of me. In all my which punishment: at all whose hands, I take them: but as the great gods instruments. His iudgement are secret: he vseth his wands, Sum times: in apparence of outward intents, To one purpose, when his high wisdome assents, To vse them for an other. And sure, I thinke he now put so, my trouble in vre. For my two saide fautes. willing you to beware, Of all ambitius: and couetus desire. In a voiding (for my like offence) my like care. Which if ye do, fleeing desire to aspire, Then can ye this lesson: as I wold require. And not doing it: vpon this warning geeuene, Ye will therto (by my like plage) to be dreeuene. And did we consider, but this present life. Yet must we liue in an order here (perde:) The god hath plaste vs all: to liue out of strife: Spiders, flies, and ants, ech sort in their degre. Spiders, in head parts of windows: the heads be. Flies, in the mids: the bodie as it weare. Ants at the low part: the feete, acounted theare. And as a spider: ouer matcheth a fli, So is a flie, as fer to big for an ant. Which semeth wrought by deuine prouidence (thinke I,) As our degrees (are in order) distant, So the degrees of our strengths, are discrepant. And where all three sorts: kepe quietlie their plase, All liue together, in quiet welthy case, But if they (for change of place) begin to striue, As spiders and flies (two parts of thre) did now, They maie hastelie striue, and sloulie thriue. And to the spider: in our alegeant vow: In all lefull things, all we ants alwaie bow. Without greefe or gruge. but if war againe rise, What should ants medle: betwene spiders and fliese. Be warnd here againe (by my harme) of medling. Medle we in things, of our vocacion. One flies finger thrusth ten ants, downe hedling. Ants are not made: to walke in warres stacion: Nor to medle in seuere consultacion. Medle we in our molehils: at the windows feete: And let spiders and flies do: as they thinke meete. They shall for me, (quoth he) and for vs cride thaie. And to their busines, busilie they went. Wherwith cum foure flies fleeing, fast as they maie. And at low part of the window: by assent, They lighted, and the spider then him selfe bent, From his house to his cheire: and I forwith, Set in my place: of their woords, to note the pith. Foure flies (in the name of al flies) at the copweb, thanking the spider for pardon and peace, declaring the condicions and the performance on their part) sew to the spider on his part, to performe his graunt, in laying out &amp; possessing them of theyr limitts with halfe the holes in the window, which he graunteth bidding them a litle staie, in which while: he sendth the yongest spider of his twaine to the ant, praying him to cum to him againe. To deuide and deliuer the holes to the flies as the spider will apoinct them. Cap. 80. One flie of those foure (made the mouth for all, At curtsie to the spider had) these woords had. Framed in maner (to the matter) formall. Right honorable sir: most dere and most drad. All flies, (thei of your prosperus estate most glad,) Haue commaunded vs: to commend them: to you, Humblie, and dewlie as deutie bidth them bow. So thanking your gifts to them, perdon and peace. Upon these condicions: as they vnderstand, Warres: and conspiracies, on their part to seace. Than tto be set free, out of their captiue band. The flie here in prison: to haue end at your hand, As standth with reason, law, custom and conscience. Halfe holes in windowes theirs: all times from hence. Which cumnants they receyue, and put in vre. In what they should do, and in what they shall haue, They thervpon send vs, to know your pleasure. What time: and what waie: ye will take to vouchsaue, To poinct and possesse them, in that ye them gaue. Binding them: (by indifferent deuided rate,) To wish contenuance, of your present state. At their curtsie made, to this: the spider saide: This sute I graunt: tarie my returne againe. In he went: and herin to haue the ants aide, To thant, he sent the least spider of his twayne. Praying thant to cum to him: and take the payne, To be his deputie: tenfeste the flies in fine, With halfe the holes wheare as the spider wold a sine. Thant spying his cosin cumming, likte it not. Sum thanklesse office was toward againe (thought he:) Thorow the window, I saw he quicklie gat: One leg, and his waste, in swadeband rold to be. And crutches by his side, a two or a three. That spider cumming to thant: where as he laie, These: or these like words, that spider did first saie. Upon this message done, thant feind a let of his c?ming: by a hurt mischansing him that morning, with which answere, the yongespider returneth to the olde. Cap. 81. Cosin ant, rest you mery. Cosin (quoth thant) Ye be welcum. what good tidings do ye bring. My father prayeth you (quoth he) at this instant, To cum to him: and for the holes deliuering, Which he in windows graunted: at warres ending, To be therein, his deputie of trust: To se flies possest, of their nombre iust. Good cosin (quoth the ant) it will not be. In a dark house (right now) where candle was light, The light dasling mine iyes: it so blinded me, That agaynst the snuf of a candle: burning bright, I flew, force of which fyre and snuf: in which flight, Mischaunce (that all misaduentours alwaie brings,) Brake one of my leggs, and burnd one of my wings. So that I now: can neither creepe nor fli. The which: for mine owne harme greeueth me right sore And as sore for his sake: that now can not I In this case, serue him as I haue done before. Thus commend me cosin: I can saie no more. That spider tooke his leaue: and to his father streight, Told what answere he had, at thant in reseight. Who seeing the ant did not cum, forth he went: With a long rod in his hand: taking his cheyre. Which when I saw, to se furder what he ment, To my cheyre in my place: I did then repeyre. The foure flies before him, stoode in order feyre. Whearwith (in few woords) a briefe tale there told he, Which done he possest them, in plat here to se. The spider after a few woords to the foure flies, assineth to them al the smal holes beneth. Halfe the holes in numbre: but scant the sixt parte of the roome. At whiche they sumwhat grudge. But they must take them or none. Cap. 82. Freends flies: freends I saie: if ye freendlie vse me, You foure and all flies: your frend shall finde me. And to make you vnable to accuse me, In lacke to performe: as promise doth binde me, Upon your present sute, I haue enclinde me: To assine and possesse you: here and els wheare, Of halfe the holes in windows: wheare I pour beare. Exampled: by these holes: iust halfe, as they stand. Them: and none but them: to haue and to hold. Wherwith: he pointed benethe with his wand, To all the small holes. saying what flie that wold: Touch anie hole theare: but those to them then told, He should die therfore: which plat thus disposed, One flie (to the spider) these words disclosed. Sir (maie it like you) the meaning of all flies, Was to haue: with halfe the holes, halfe the plat here. And I flie (quoth the spider) ment otherwise. Without furder pleding: take as doth appere. And think your selues well handled: for this is clere. I might (yf I wold,) my graunt againe withdraw. And that withdrawing, Iustifie well by law. At time of this graunt, I was (as who say.) Stressed by you: you prisoner (as it weare) And all bonds so forced, of no force are they: Be answerd: and warnd, rebellion to for beare. As euerie flie: had had a flea: in his eare, At curtsie low made, from the spider they slank. They meruelus blank, and the spider as crank. What haue we woon now, (quoth one) as they tooke wing. Wise flies saie: as good sit still: as rise and fall. But what a fall haue we now: by our rising? Before, we had sum part: now we haue lost all. In effect, yea (quoth one) this hath bene and shall. Wheare flies (with spiders) in this kinde of strife striue, We win nought but wrechidnesse, the craft will not thriue. The foure flies flowne thence, the spider to the flie in prison leith: that in all kinds of triall that daie on both parts laide, he thinketh his owne part aproued best. as he thinketh the flie wolde thinke were he a spider contrarie iudgement wherof, the flie thinketh in the spider were he a flie. wherupon they agree to change places (eche for the time) to imagin and set foorth others part the best they can. Cap. 83. They being thus gone: the spider sitting still, The flie fast before him: as he erst had bene, To draw to end, in hand with the flie he fyll. Flie (quoth he) now hast thou in this matter sene, All kinds of triall, that can be sene I wine. Reson, law, and custom, full resoned and cast. Arbiterment, and rebellion at last. Which rebellion (I think) thou didst deuise, When thou didst rowne the butterflie in the eare. Naie (quoth the flie) the trewth is clere otherwise. I praide him to praie flies: all war to forbeare, Which he will saie. flie (quoth he) saie he or sweare: I trust none of you. This trithe trewth like in preefe, As to axe my felow, whether I be a theefe. But weare it so: or not: I forgiue it thee. In all this bybble babble: had here this daie: What hast thou woon therby: that let vs se. All cases past here: indifferentlie to waie: Waie more on my side: then on thine, I dare saie. I saie and think naie (quoth he) and so think wold you: Weare ye a flie, in case as I am here now, And weare thou a spider: as I am here plaste, I think thou wouldst think as I think: and to grow: Sum waie to end, one triall mo to taste, Lest vs change places a while: for to know, What change of oppinion, that change maie show. I: maginning my selfe, to be a flie. Thou: thinking thy selfe, a spider vnfaynedlie. Thou the spider: and I the flie: to be namde. Thou resoning for the spider, all that thou maie. And I for the flie: in like case will be framde. This take I (quoth the flie) a verie good waie. Place and case (in apparence) forthwith chaunge thay. The flie: solemlie set in the spiders cheyre, The spider: to the flies base place did repeyre. They hauing Chaunged places: they alege eche for his dissembled side. Wherin the flie anone is so alured to pride and ambyssyon in occupying (for the while) the spiders statelie place, that he at last with an othe affirmeth that spiders are owners of all windowes. The spider graunting it trew, sterteth to the flie, seeming to take end vpon the flies owne iudgement. Cap. 84. The flie: being once set in the spiders place, Aduaunst him selfe, setting hands vnder his side. The spider croucht in countenance milde and base: Looking pale and wan, as though he should haue dide. Which change (vpon this soden) when I espide, It prinnted in me: a wonderfull wunder, To se partise (from their parts) so a sunder. New matter they laide small. But that most touched: That had bene erst alegde. Both parts growing: Litle and litle, stoughtlie to be couched, Ech to others: against his owne part now showing. Namlie the flie: for the spiders part crowing. With spiderlike: spightfull woords: as hote and hie, As he had bene the spider, and thother the flie. He was from the flies part: so caried a waie, By being sodenlie: there thus eliuate, That: all cleyme leyde by the spider there: that daie, The flie ruld, for right of most lawfull right rate. So ferforth he forgat: where and how he sate: That vpon the cheyreboll: hard beating his fist, Spiders owe all windows, he sware by gods blist. The spider graunted it trew sterting out streyte: To the flie. saying syr ye haue saide right well. We neede no longer (for iudge or iudgement) weyte. Our cheefe point in iudgement, your selfe doth here tell. Oh sir (quoth) the flie, and flat to ground he fell. I beseche you here how (by pride here now had) I was striken beetill blind, and bedlem mad. The flie out of that chaier falne flat before the spider, perseyuing his ouersight and daunger therin, he declareth howe change of place changed his affection. In discoorsing of which case, he partlie toucheth the commoditie of aduersitie, and the discommoditie of prosperitie. Beseeching the spider to relinquishe all aduauntage therin to be taken against him. Which the spider graunteth. Cap. 85. The spider leaning to his cheyre, saide: saie on. Syr (saide the flie) by veynglorious pride, It stealing: slie and sodenlie: me vpon, I was so puft vp here: so blindlie my selfe to gide, That I neither saw yours, nor yet mine owne side, I: once but set, in place of your auctorite: Tooke my selfe streight, in case of your prosperite. Which place and case: how they mai right iudgement blinde. That se I now, and neuer till now could se. Whearin: I being but a shadow assinde: For this time to sit. yet marke (I beseche ye,) How from a flies state, to a spiders degre: I (at moment) avaunst my selfe to proseede. Not with flies, but with spiders: all I decreede. My which blindnesse (in sum respect) doth streche, To those: in places paste, as debiteese. They keping countenance: of my like high reche: Looking ech as high, when he his suter seese, As his head master, offer higher degreese. Which flock (as I am now) where euer it flocks. All made (in reason,) reasons mocking stocks. Se more: how beastlie blindnesse, did my bent bende: Life, and liberte of me, and of all flies. Here lying and bleding, except I it defende, All that not withstanding: pride blearde both mine iyes, Agaynst them and my selfe, sentence to deuise. I was a spider I. I tooke flies as flease. Pride goth before, shame cumth after: me to sease. But pride had here, a sotell slie alurer. Which, the countenance of prosperite was. Ueyne liking of which state: was my procurer, To pride and blindnesse therby, that here did pas. Which pride to present, prosperite is a glas. As doth (on the other parte) aduersite, Fyrst procure: and then present, humilite. Prosperite (we se) made me forget clere: My selfe, my matter, al flies, and also you. Which in aduersite, I heeld in minde here. To you, as deutie required: I could there bow: Reasons for me: and all flies: I could a vow: Our parfight sight: from blindnesse: standth not (I se) In prosperite, but in aduersite. Which showth in this one change: of our two places, My place of aduersite: gaue you such sight, That: in our reasoning of both our cases, Your saying showde you, to se the verie right. Your place of prosperite, blinded me quight. As I perceiue) it doth blinde all (in like case. Saue such as therin, haue especiall grace, In lack wherof: I (thus gracelesse a minion, Thus loudlie and lewdlie to lie,) humblie praie: Neither my iudgement, nor yet mine opinion. Anie woord to be iudgde, that I here did saie. But (as all lies should) let these vanish awaie. Thou art (quoth the spider) a monster now woxe. In myne iye a flie, and in mine eare a foxe. Like a foxe: wililie thou doste here deuise, For helping of thy part: and hurting of mine, To take my lise trew tales, and thy trew tales lise. And furder slaundring me: and my state: in fine, Thou haste here set forth, this deuilsh dissipline. Pride hideth knowledge (saist thou) by prosperite, Humilite showth knowledge, by aduersite. As though captife caitifs: saw all in miserie, And prosperus princes, saw nought. But I se: Thou art in a wrong boxe: for case presentlie, The flie (seeing rightnought woon herby wold be, But daunger of displeasure, thervpon he:) Past ouer this argument: and vpon that, Said this to the spider, at his foote laide flat. Sir: I besech you: my blindnesse showde here last, For giue: and none aduauntage on me take. In anie woord of mine, against me theare past, Flie (quoth he) I forgiue thee: for pitties sake. To chaunge places againe, a sonder they brake. Wherewith the spider: in forme formall and colde, These woordes folowing, to the flie forthwith tolde. The spider vpon a glaunce geuen at his desert of thanke to be had at the flies hand, alegeth custom to be hys warrant to distroy the flie. Which the flie can not denie. Whervpon he desireth that the case maie be reasoned in conscience. Which the spider now graunteth. Cap. 86. Ffie: if thou canst vse the reason that thou haste, Thou canst (and wilt) thanke me in manie respects. Neuer was there flie: in copweb thus plaste, That had the like fauour: in the like effects: That thou hast had: but nesessite directs, This to be trew: in the daie most long here past. Yet they (euermore) ring to euensong at last. As who saie: things most long after beginning: Yet must they (at last) nedlie cum to an ende, Which (after long time) wrought to haue in winning, We now shall win which ende shall brieflie depende, Upon one briefe reason that I shall extende. Which reason to confute thee, shalbe so plaine, That streyght to yeeld thee, reason shall the constraine. Which lurkth (and I all this time haue let it lurk:) In custom: one principle of the four, On which pillers, I promisde should stand all this wurk. Which in vinsible reason: I (to this hour) Haue kept: to here (as I haue herd) bran and flour: Of all that thou couldst (this daie) for thy part laie. Which (for full conclusion, here me to thee saie. Custom: one cheefe post principall (as erst saide) Declarth: and hath declarde this six thousand yere, All flies (or anie flie) in copwebs (or copweb) staide: How euer they cum theare, if they theare appere: No reason: in reason and law: aledge here: Could discharge th? thence, but streight there c?th a maine, A spider: who sleath him and suckth out his braine. Here seest thou thy life lost: to begin with all: By custome: and for windows claimd in entreste: For flies generall, agreement generall. (With theyr resceiuing it) an end hath expreste. Thend had I meane, vpon rebellion seste. But for thy life (by custom) canst thou ought saie: Why thou should by custome liue? syr (saide he) naie. Well (quoth the spider) thou seest reason and law So yeeld to custom here, that in anie triall: Those tweyne to conquere custom here: we neuer saw. I haue to this (quoth the flie) no deniall. What thing (quoth the spider) hast thou in sepciall: To help thee: by side law, custom, and reason: Conscience (quoth the flie) I hope cumth in season. Trew (quoth the spider) now at end it hath place. What haste thou (in conscience) for thy life to lay: Against accustomed custom in this case. Inough (quoth he) if conscience beare ani sway, Yes (quoth the spider) be bold of that ye may: That fourth: shall haue full place, as firme as those three. I thanke you (quoth the flie) this showth charite. They both laie sundrie sharpe reasons inconscience for the spiders life and death. But the spider in conclusion draweth these foure principles (reason, law, custom, and conscience, which he at beginning graunted to trie all by) so to combine that he maketh therby an aparence, to show the flie conuinst &amp; streight by custom: he geueth iudgement of the flies death to which the flie yeldeth. Praying to speak with twelue flies before he die. And it is graunted. Cap. 87. By conscience I clayme here now (quoth the flie) In this place (till now place of mine inprisonment,) Not to be in prison, but in seyntuarie. Wheare as charged parties be inosent, Of all such charged crimes: as to them are bent, Theare doth conscience in euerie place defende, Those charged parties: discharging them at ende. If (quoth the spider) theare were no difference: Betwene a flie inosent: and arogant, Then must I discharge thee (euin of conscience.) But if innosensie on your part here want, Then is this clause (for your discharge) no warant But go to: make profe approbatlie appere: How ye proue your selfe, an inosent now here. Sir: prof: that I inosentlie hither cam, Appeerth in my knowne c?ming, against my will. And sins I came, that I an inosent am, I hope your conscience: and I know your skill, Will iudge: my fact here not ill: or not so ill: Wherby ye (with conscience) can rightfullie: Either kill me, or kepe me here thus to lie. What haue I done: in conscience strayte or large: To make reason, law, or custom, bight or bark. I leie and leide (quoth the spider) to thy charge, Brech of my house: not made with a thousand mark, No (quoth he) but one quarter of one hours wark, Without one penie cost: or one pins worth paine, Reaedifithe your house, in priuie state againe, Which your selfe maie do: and must naturallie. That woorke, is your talent: giuen for exercise. In lack wherof, (by idilenesse) ye streight die. But put case custom, my fact a wrong here trise: Yet how can conscience: death or payne deuise. To me, for that I to you: occasion giue, To woorke the woork: lacking which, ye can not liue. Though (quoth the spider) by nature woork we must. Yet ist neither conscience, nor our auaile: To woork in copwebs: haue we lust or no lust, At wagging (in copwebs) of euerie flies taile, So doth it (quoth the flie) conscience likewise quaile. To hang a flie: by the neck or by the neb, For wagging his tayle, in a spiders copweb. This case is (in conscience) very much like, As a fysh breaking a fishers set net: It set to take the fisshe, and the fissher did pike, A quarell to him: and wold conscience set, To kill the poore fisshe. This were fer and foule fet, And no fouler fet: then conscience set to be: To kill me, for brech of this net: set for me, But did I (maliciouslie, do you much wrong: And sum harme: as harme (or wrong) here ye haue none. Yet shall your reuengment, show malice more strong: If ye both deteyne: and kill me thervpone: Cum that wrong here in vre: conscience is gone: As fer from you: as from him: that had now sworne The death of an inosent, but last might borne. You not offended (as ye will not I hope) This last principle of these foure: conscience: (It geuing me (a boue thother three) full scope) Of aduantage: as custom giueth assistence. To your part, in present charge of mine offence: I must make my shoote anker: to make my waie, As you make (and I graunt) custom yours (no naie.) Spare not (quoth the spider) that anker shoote ought: The best thou canst therwith to take ankerhold. I thanke you (quoth he) and wold craue (if I mought,) Your answere in conscience: full to vnfold, To one question of me: in few woordes told. Thy question (quoth the spider) propone thou, And mine answere to it, thou shalt haue euin now. This is then sir: I put case quoth the flie: My yong maister spider your son: went a straie: Wandring here and theare (at aduenture meane I,) Wherwith: slilie: one laide a thing in the waie: Wherat the babe fell, and it thus brought to bay, Thother: for falling theare, kild it out of hand. Thinke ye: conscience wold warrant this deede to stand? Naie (quoth he) conscience is the doer of right. Mittigating ferce force of extremitees, That geueth or taketh right: by rigorus might. Conscience (quoth the flie) my iudgement so decrees. And my case: with this case: in all points a grees, No difference betwene them: to be lost or woon, Sauing: that I am not your masterships soon, For in like case put: I wanderid aboute here: Inosentlie, as that inosent there did. And by these copwebs: cast in my waie thus nere, In this babe exampling, I am examplid. Inosentlie as he was, I am maskid. Think if I weare your childe: what ye could think than: Conscience, or no conscience this to scan. In faith flie (quoth the spider) to tell the trouth, No conscience (or hard conscience) I take this. Nay no conscience (quoth the flie) trouth so showth. So that conciens, on my side clerlie is: As custom is of yours: and ye know I wis: That custom a lone: doth oft, and maie euer: Use iudgment of abuse: and conscience neuer. Well saide flie (saide he) had I no more to saie: To this that thou now seist: then I haue yet saide, Then hadst thou here woon the victorie this daie. But reason, law, custom, and conscience, erst leide: How I graunted thee hering: in those four weide, Thou shalt here in few woords, and we there vpone, Shall the more clerli, conclude this case anone. The woords of my graunt tadiudge thee: thus they draw As standth with reason, law, custom, and conscience, Not with reason, custom, conscience, or law: This, and, and this or, flie: make much difference. That and, implith all foure plaste: in assistence, That or, importh one: or anie one of all. And here is the gap flie: wherein lith the gall, And a pointe for flies learning: at spiders hand. Though ye: flies learning aboue spiders compare: But here learne of me flie: this coniunctiue and, Conioynth: these four saide terms: ioyntlie to prepare, Triall in this case: as they all maie declare: The tone with the tother: all in properte, Knit best in knot, of conioyned vnite. Well (quoth the flie) then concience shalbe one, Ye (quoth the spider) and custom a nother. Syr then will those two, fall at a fraie a none. Yf they do: reason shall stikill them brother: To make them a gree. Where ech impoungth other: But bring conscience: thy champion armd compleete: How conscience chalength custom: let vs weete. Sir: I cuming (as I cam) vnwillinglie, And none offensife harme: in me doth appere, Conscience chargeth custom, with tirranie. In killing (or keping) me: inosent here. Which case, reason recordith for case clere. This charge (quoth the spider) to discharge plaine, Here what custom saith, to concience againe. Custom saith: all windows are spiders of right. Then conscience must saie: that flies haue done wrong, Through windows (without leaue) to take theyr flight, To make conscience graunt this, reason is strong. Till spiders (quoth he) time present, and past long. Do proue windows theirs: as they neuer did yeet, Conscience and reason, denith this eueri wheet, But admit we: that all windows were your owne: Flies (without your leaue) passing offensiflie. Though custom a lege: for thoffence: death here growne. yet conscience (in this case) sethe death tirrannie. Reason graunting it, to show tiranniouslie. It weare to much here: to fine by the purs. But to fine by the polle, what feend could polle wurs? Thou thinkst (quoth the spider) conscience thinkth it stra?ge; That flies: by custom, should die for this offence. But conscience: with reason raunging in raunge, In cause of customs vsage: as conscience: Maie haue with reason herein: full conference, Reasonablie reasoning: this present case, Conscience (by reason)shall giue custom plase. I say (as I erst saide) when a flie or flies: In this: or anie window: in copwebs light, Anie spider: that within that window lies, Shall kill him, and suck out his (or their) braine quight, Which: begoon by nature, custom folowth right. Nature conseiuing: but for this her sharp law, Flies wold haue mard all: for lack of orderlie aw. And as nature in spiders: wrought this defence, So reason in man: was driuen to woork the same, Cains generation making resistence: Against all men: that quiet order wold frame, (as you against vs do) then those men to tame: And defende the quiet: in their quiet cause, Reason to thvnquiet, gaue our like sharp lause. But reason to them wrought not this: to thentent: To catch them: and kill them: tiraniously, But to saue them: by terror in their iyes bent: To prouoke them to flee thoccacion: wherby: They might flee theyr ill, felt therby formerly. Which: as reason in man did (and doth) consither, So did nature in vs, both concur togither. Nature in vs, reason (I saie) so a lowde, That this law of nature in vs, laide on flies, Reason: to man: for order in man, hath vowde, For breaking a wall bi night: man as sone dise, As flies for copwebs brech by daie, which exersise: Conscience (by reason) not kicking at: for man Conscience (by reason) kickth not at, for flies than: Reason in man: woorkth man to woorke (quoth the flie) Sharpe lawes: more to saue the good: then to slea thill, Nature in spiders, woorkth sharpe lawes: cruellie: Not to saue the good, but good and ill to kill, Onlie killing all: on all, to feede their fill. Thou liest (quoth he) we woorke copwebs euerie wheare, To saue flies by feare, copwebs to for beare. Thus: reason hath concience and custom agrede. Wherto: law not repungnant, all the world knowes. Whervpon (without more parting) to prosede, Concordance of these principles: here so showes, That here, here thine end flie: for here thine ende growes, By custom (it eidid with these other said three,) Thy present death, I presentlie here decree. The flie farde as though he wold haue spoken more. But: his hart wunderlie faynted, and fayled. His iudgment of death: astonide him so sore, (In that he saw his speech: right nought preuayled: To be (from death) deliuered or bayled,) That downe he sank vpon his knees and hands. Requesting the spider, in case as next stands. Good maister spider: sins the case stands thus, That die I must, follie were it for me here: To pleade this cass furder: it past by discus: All pleading: or reasoning, I geue ouer clere. Submitting and committing: my life most dere, Into your hands, beseching you ere I di, To graunt me: one petission: mo craue not I: That is that I (before you) my minde maie saie, To twelue flies, which speech I promise faithfullie: Eyther with you, or not against you shall waie. I graunt (quoth the spider) and by and bie, I know not whether by chaunce, or purposlie. A dosen flies: aboute the copwebs side plaste weare, To whom: this folowing, the flie said then and theare. The flie (to twelue graue flies for all flies) geueth his aduice for a voiding their parels by their strife had in windowes against spiders. the great gronnde of which tale standeth most vpon consideration of these three things. wherfore they striue, with whom they striue, and how they striue Cap. 88. Cosins and contrie flies: ech one of you all, A nother my selfe: as ech of all flies are. I haue (at sute) obteind, you hither to call, Minding: my conscience to you to declare, In such a time: and such a thing, to prepare, As the time, most meete to make you credit me, And the thing, most meete to you: told to be. First: as touchinge time, no time in my time past. When I was more prosperous (and so more fraile:) Then I this time am: yet all times first and last: Your trust in my trewth, did not anie time faile. But what time should credence: set vp so his saile? As this time: when life time shall no more time hold. But till time this my tale (to be told) be told. In all sorts of seckts: of ciuile dissipline: Of all times in life: of anie flie I trow, In time of his knowne death: cumming streight like mine, Credence of his woord (he feende nor foole in show) To credit his matter: must that time most grow. What vanite weare this: in ought to deuise: Lieing now a dieing, to lie and deuise lise. Of all times: for credit (I saie none like this. And secondlie: touching the thing, here to tell: Hering therof, no dout most meete for you is. Which thing, is the strife of furius force fell: Betwene spiders and flies. wherin to exepell: And kill all occasions in time to cum, Of my last will (in my last woords) here the sum. What waie is herein best: for spiders to take: That can them selues tell: much better then can I, I am a flie: no spider nor spiders make: To controle the spiders part, but hartily, I pray the great God: their harts to molify: As temperance maie temper their cleime: touching this, To geue right, and take right, as most rightfull is. But: in right of either part: to determin ought: What thei for their part: or you for yours should haue, Shift that among you: for it forsith me nought. Me semth, I here the matok digging my graue. The crowne of the whole world: who it me now gaue. His good will must I thanke: but for ought to win, I take not the gift, worth the point of a pin. And wheare you (and all flies) are as sure to die, As am I now: your times to you vnknowne sure. Aduantage of you: in my knowne death haue I, In hauing some time of remors: to procure, Forgeuenesse of former life, led in lewde lure. Wheare you maie (without remors) sodenlie go: And where the tree falth, theare lithe it: clarks say so. But: for profitable purpose toward you: In purpose purposed to you here by me, Your imaginasions: I praie: to draw you now, Into my person: as in my case to be. To woork affection: to win effect in ye: To consceiue and resceiue things: that I shall moue. Which: to your behofe, behouinglie behoue, Thre principles Whereon my tale to contriue: And to proseede vpon, are these to prepose. Wherfore we striue: with whom we striue: how we striue. Wherfore we striue: ye know the cause therof gose, For hooles in windows. which quarels to disclose: Our cumming to them: and going from them sought, Shall show our winning small: or rather rightnought. First for our cumming to them: who can disscriue: How manie flies, haue preaste: possession to win, That neuer could get possession a liue. But maimd and kild downe right: at their entre in. And such as do cum in (where spiders do spin) Most wise flie: deuising to sit there most fast, Maie thinke his first hour (or ech hour) there: his last. Few flies (I thinke) haue scapt longer here then I, My which time being spent: betwene hope and feare, Yet at last (for all my shifts) lo where I lie. Where no raunsum: my redemption, maie reare. But my life, remedilesse I must forbeare. Cum with daunger, bide with feare, depart with deth. To hastie a iorney to take with one breth. In this saide first principle: what we striue fore, Commodite therin: profe doth thus witnesse: The more flies haue of it: flies daunger the more. The lesse flies haue of it: flies daunger the lesse. Then is nowhit best: for who doth ought possesse: Ech peniworth of pleasure: of such possest ware, Bringth more then counterpaise: of daunger and care. Beggers flies: before theeuis flies maie sing (we saie) Rich flies before trow flies here, do weepe (we see.) The richest winning flie: in windows to waie: If anie winning there: anie riches be, As the best thing woon theare is but flies liberte What is the winning: woon and kept with such strife, That hourlie winth deth: or deadlie feare of life. It is a winning: better lost then woon. And so: these windows are: wherefore we striue. With whom we striue now: secondli to roon: With our biggers to contend: we here contriue, A mach: as much vnmeete for vs to thriue, As maie be macht. for two things here to trie. First thing their pour, most thing their pollisie, To their much pour: our pour oftimes thought more; By nomber: manie small making a greate, There pollisie (keping their pour in store:) Hath most times erst, brought vs our selues to beate. What winning is in this macht mache to geate? None. Wherfore with whome we striue (I thinke it best,) To leaue of strife: and liue by losse in rest. Now: thirdlie: how or in what maner we striue: To tell plaine trouth: in my worst time to lie, Spice of rebellion our strife showth to contriue Spiders are plaste a boue superiorlie And flies beneth them plaste inferiorlie. Then maie it seme, as they aboue vs haue plase, So haue they aboue vs like rule in like case. Which case graunted: in striuing ageinst them thus: Our matter: standing in state of most right: Yet is our maner wrong: and sedicius. No law alowth flies: to win their right by fight, Betwene priuate flies. and law inibbitih quight: Anie flies to fight: against their hygh heades, But rather suffer, as obedience leades. Wherefore we striue: ye se trifils thei are. With whom we striue: their pollisie passeth our pour. How we striue: doth sedicion declare. Three parts without melodie, in the part of our. Our part hath a face here: no crab more sour. To moue flies (hens forward) to turne their faces, From strife with spiders, in quareling cases. To which: you drawing your imaginacion: As though ye stood in my state: at this present, Your owne consent must giue confirmation: My woords herin past, to haue a trew extent. And furder the shoote anker: experiment: What ye lost at spiders hands: late before this, A full ratificasion, of my tale: that is. And if that anie flie: will demaunde of me: What meane flies maie vse best: their right to obtayne, Myne answere is: not in harnes capa pe: Beseeging (sted of beseeching) to constraine: Nor stur: with euerie flie: sturd by bedlem braine, Sturdilie standing: with bills in foull fighting, But humblie sewing, with bills of faire wrighting. By ought (in anie law) that euer I wist: Thus may flies sew, for right and not onlie maie, But sew so: flies must: forbiddin to resist: Their higher powrs: by violence (anie waie) Which waie not helping flies: their waie is to praie: Unto the great god. To woorke spiders consent, To geue and take right: in right rated extent. But furder (in this case) wheare anie flies go: Of long time: of late time: and this time is seene: Yea: sene, hard and felt: in our present wrought wo: That we are wrong doers, and euer haue bene. Our woorks herin witnessing so: that I wene: No flie so foolish: but he doth vnderstand, Our harme: for wrong woorking: we haue at gods hand. This to be trew I thinke and haue thought Which (master spider) maie suspicion clere, In your susspecting me, for late tumult wrought, But on my deth I take (which I shall take here) I neuer a vowde (nor a lowde) to draw nere: Anie nombre: by lawles vsurped powrs, But as peasablie stoode, with gods peace and yours. But for fine: friends: in your beholding my deth: As thimage of your owne deths: pleinly to purport, In that: one howrs quarter: ye are sure vneth: To scape the same: to get ought by your extort, Or get or kepe ought: in anie wrongfull sort, That sight: with thinking of my woords in the reste, Maie: hensforth of strife here: bring your side surseste. Behold your deths in me, by vncerteine life. Behold your dread in me: your liues a count: to make. Behold wherefore ye striue: and that deth endth your strife, Behold with whom and how ye striue: (as I spake.) Behold the loosing gaine, that winth losse to take, Beholding these winnings: with the ieberdees, Showth holes in windows (to behold) vanitees. And: so all holes in windows: to take and vse: That none offensife strife: flies abuse procure, But peasablie: as dew obedience enduse: To put (hauing or crauing of right) in vre, This craue I of you: for loue to you most pure. And thus (paying you to praie for me at ende,) To the almightie lord, my sprit I commende. The flies (vnto these woords) no woord could speake. But yeelded teares: like drops in Aprill showrs. Sauing in outcrie: as they thence did breake, They cride farewell: (of flies) the flour of flowrs. But well: the last hour hath no folowing howrs The hour is cum: wherin the flie must die. For which: he weitth, at spiders foote prostratlie. As the spider is about to kill the flie, the mayde of the house commeth in and striketh downe the copweb and the spider to the ground. Cap. 89. The spider toward the flie, furiouslie drawse. And being stept to the flie: staying in stop, As he wold have perst the flies hed: with his pawse, The maide of the house, to the window did chop. Setting her brome, hard to the copwebs top. Where: at one stroke with her brome: striken rounde, The copweb and spider, she strake to the grounde. The maide being at poinct to treade the spider to death: the spider praieth her to here him speake ere he die: and then to adiudge him iustlie. the maide graunting to vse him (as he dyd vse the flie) as maie best stand with reason, law, custum, and conscience. She at his request (for the time) withdrawing hyr foote, they fall to reasoning of the case. Cap. 90. The maide (by mine absence) to be the more bold, To woorke her will, as she cam in, I went out. And lookte in at the window: her to behold. She swept downe the copweb: the flie flew about The parler round. Neuer more lustie nor stout. The spider on the grounde: vnder the maides foote, To treade him to death, and was aboute to doote. But the spider (on knees) lift vp his hands hie, Beseching her (of milde maidenlie pittie, To be content to here him speake ere he die: And to declare. First what he had doone, and then whie: He did those deedes: and so to iudge him iustlie. And that she wold (in meane time) her foote withdraw, Sight wherof: made his hed ake, and his stomock gnaw. To banish (quoth the maide) all pershall presence, Ile heare and iudge thee, as thou didst the flie heere. As standth with reason, law, custom, and conscience, So shalt thou have good, bad, hie, low, fer or neere. And since: feare of my foote: abateth thy cheere, Least thou mightst take harme: of thine owne conceight, That I withdraw: and so withdrew it streight. In reasoning of both sides, the maide driueth the spider to graunt him selfe conuinse (by custom eyded with the other principles erst saide) as he conuinst and adiudged the flie before. Whervpon she (by custom) decreth the spider to die. He then desiring to speake with his sonne and his counsell. Which the mayde graunteth. Cap. 91. Feyre and good maistres maidinlie maide (quoth he) Leauing the brim: to the botum to wade, What deedes I have done here: you haue sene and se. Which are: the copwebs in windows here made. Of all spiders, the naturall trase to trade. Which to be impungde, we neuer herde nor saw, In reason, custom, conscience, nor law. Spider (quoth the maide) know ye that I hard: All: this daie betwene you and the flie here saide. Wherin I saw: the cause wherfore ye iard: Was not for that ye: copwebs here wrought and laide, But for the place ye wrought them in: as thus waide: You: to beelde in top and top side: the flie heelde, You heelde the whole yours: in all places to beelde. The flie heelde: that all flies hold all holes in freeholde. You (for all spiders) heelde that frehold all yours. In reason, law, and custom, ech to other told, Your minds in this matter: (at leaste) fiue long hours. At end wherof, it past both your witts and pours: To take end your selues, but weare driuine to deuise, Arbiters: to take an end by comprimise. Which matter: as both sides writhed it and wounde it, Your arbiters theare: the ant and butterflie, Weare driuen to leaue it, at large as they founde it Whervpon ye finalli: burdenuslie: Burdend the flie, with custom: therby to die. Which he could not denie: and for his defence, He gat the case to be reasond, in conscience. Wherein (by nature in you: and reason in man,) Ye fet a discoorse: reasonabli sounding, With reason: and conscience: that custom to scan, Whearvpon appeerde: infallible grounding, To bring the flie iustlie, to his confounding. And: had not bene your vsurping: in this plase, Conscience: with custom: had stand in this case. Custom graunteth: and conscience not denithe: Disturbing your copwebs: wrought in top poste, The flie (for thoffence) accustomable dithe. But copwebs vpon copwebs: pirld in ech coste: All parts of windows to be so enboste: That no flie can passe: without deths entrupsion. Conscience construth that custom: corrupsion. In taking the flies part here: I take myne owne. I: being mayde of the house, my charge it is: To se copwebs corrected. Thus ouer growne, And so will I do (spider) be sure of this, Well (quoth the spider) yf I have done a mis, Redresse mine ill doing: and let me go free. Naie naie spider (quoth the maide) that maie not be. Swept I these superfluus copwebs now hence: Letting thee passe: in this window to remaine, Custom: hath so corrupted thi conscience: That wheare is now one copweb, there should be twaine. Well (quoth he) sins ye like not (as apperth pleine) What I have done, yet here why: I have done it. Which shall (I hope) appease your Ire eueriwhit. The whi (or wherfore) I did that I haue done, Was: that flies (beyond nombre) did here resort: Blowing meate here (raw and roste) beyond the mone. Which wrought your master and maistres in speech short: To rebuke you sore, to your deepe discomfort. Which to redres: I, in pitteing of you, Set nets to catche flies: as I do now. Here is (quoth the maide) one trewth told, and one lie, That flies haue my meate here outrageouslie blowne, That is trulie saide: and it for trew graunt I. But that thou didst set nets here: all ouergrowne: Ought for my pleasure: and not all for thine owne, Thats a false tale. To which: pollisie thee drawse, To win fauer at my handes, clere without cause. But weare it as trew as it is fals: yet thou: And thy familie: do me displeasure more: Then pleasure in this: for your nie approch now, Is: to my master and maistres: an iye sore. Aboue the flies blowing: by degreese a score. They both: lothe lesse to haue (be it flesh or fish, Ten flies in their meate, then one spider in their dish. And in their dish woldst thou and thine sureli be: If I (rather to late then in time dew) Tooke thee not vp: as is my charge in dewte: Executing mine office, did I eschew: To correct such pride in thee: as neuer grew: In spider erst, then my master and maistres: Of my rebuke, had iust cause of encres. And haste thou bene neuer so seruisable: In doing thy dewtie: in manie things right. Yet: this thy vsurppacion abhominable, Hath drowned thy thanke of those dew done deedes: quight, Which is to be witness, in all the worlds sight. All reasons: in law, custom, and conscience weide, Against the flie, are now against thy selfe leide. And as thou madest custom thi shootanker cheefe, (Conioyning thereto: reason, law, and conscience,) Of the flies death (by right) to make perfight preefe, From first age of the world: had in consequence, So bring I custom: fet like fer time from hence. Custom: is thi warrant: to suche the flies braine, Whereto: marke how custom warrantth me againe. From the beginning: it is thacustomd gies. When spiders in windowes their copwebs so make: That they to fer offende: their beholders iyes, The maide of the house with her brome: at a strake, Swepth downe those copwebs, and those spiders take. Under her foote. And for anie intersesse, Those spiders (with her foote) to deth she doth presse Which custom is vnderpropped (as I saide) With reason, with law, and with conscience: for me, As stronglie in my case, as for thee in thine laide. Now speake spider canst thou deni this (quoth she?) Nay for soth: I can not denie it (quoth he) But am driuen to graunt it: and euin so I do. Your mercifull hands, I commit me into. Thou shalt haue (quoth she) mercie euin as much: At my hands, as the flie should haue had at thine. Cast of all veine hope: sins thy fortune is such, Thy selfe framing fortune: to thy this ruine, Make pacience thy salue, for this sore in fine. And make thee redie spider: for finallie, I assuredlie assure thee, thou shalt die. The change of his chere at these woords made me se, How the dread of deth, could lambs of lions make. This lionlike spider: erst feerce as could be, Feare, did all his furie: full fer then aslake. His hart: in a pursnet was easie to take. Change (by chance) brought him (at twinke of an iye,) From twig top of the tree, at the rote to lie. These two things are meete things (as me thinkth) to note. The spider right now so hie: euin now so low. The flie right now at eb, euin now a flote. The tromp of his fame, neuer so hie did blow. Thothers tromp of shame, as hie in sounde doth show. Which blasts of which tromps (in mine eare) blew this blast: Fickill fortune, will neuer leaue her old cast. But to the matter: the spider praide the maide, To speake with his son and heyre: before he dide: And with his counsell. She was content (she saide) Chaunce being messenger, chaunce thither streight hide: His son: and twelue councellers, hard by his side. Wherevpon: he theare and then discoorst his minde, In matter such, as ye next this maie finde. The spider to his sonne and twelue spiders giueth his best aduise for most quiet and best gouernance. His tale standinge most vpon these three terms, first a decleracion of him selfe, second an exhortacion to them, the third a submission for him self, whervnto he desireth lic?ce to take his child in his armes: now at their departing, which the maide graunteth. Cap. 92. My dere childe, my nere freendes, and councellors late: My short time: not a lowing long talke with you, When I wold most long: and most deeplie debate: (Mine estate past and present) with you all now: My talke most short: and therby most sleight talow: I must: and (sins I must) will deuice to tell. Charging my child: and praing you, to waie it well. This short tale: shortned by short time (as I sey,) For a ground: of ferme framed foundacion: Upon these three principles, I will here ley. The first: of my self, a declaracion. The second: to you, an exhortacion. The third, for my selfe: a submission: For remission, of my ill condission. First: I declare and confesse my former life, Cheefe: in time and place of mine auctorite: To wring to the worse (by right or wrong in strife) All flies or spiders: that wold stand against me: Their distruction, was my felicite. My displeasure: (as I vsde it in quarell,) Was: as iudgment of death. or dethlike parell, Mine ambicius desire, here to declare: In winning in windows, no one so nie all. (Which I might haue kept: quietlie to my share.) When my winning was most, I thought it to small. The shooting at all: was my marke principall, And now: shooting at all, I haue lost all quight. The meane: is the merie part: being soong right, And of the two extreme parts: (as I take it) The base: is better then the treble: to sing. Treble prosperite, reason doth make it: Worse then base aduersite, it approuing: In the flies base: and my treble state: erst mouing. Prosperite, (as that flie saide) makth vs blinde. Aduersite, (I feele) giueth sight by kinde. When I had all: that could welnie begot, Restreint of libertie, had bene my hell paine. Now I haue nought, I weare content with lot: To sit and beg: fast locked in a chaine. I neuer to obtaine: more estate or gaine: But onlie life and liuing: such as wold, Mainteine a beggers life, baselie to hold. But life, liberte, lands and all, must I loose. And I confesse me to leese all, worthili. Euerie wight is worthie to haue: as he doose. Lands, life, and goods, of manie flies: had haue I. And now must I leaue life, lands, and goods, semblablie. This long learnd leason, I late had forgottun. Our mesurs mette to other, shal to vs be mottun. But in this measure, here me measure right. How wrong iudgers, wrong iudgements: in this text laie. Sum expounde it so largelie, that in their sight: Wheare aucthorised iudges: ponishment waie: Mesuring harme: to harme doers: thill to stay: If anie ill: cum to those iudges: eft sone, That iudge thill to be done, for thill to them done. But: those iudgements grow of this condission: Malice arogant, or ingnorance insolent. Mothers: of erronius exposission. This text hath a limit: how fer it hath bent: Such harms as chance iudges: or such as assent: To procure ponishment: to such as are nought, Those harms: vnto them: for that, are not wrought. Iudgements of the great god, are secret (we know:) A iudge vsing iustice: of iust trew dealing: The god maie ponish, for other things that grow. Which he knowth, and we know not: (by reuealing) And oftimes the good: (their glorie ensealing: He ponishth sum here, as standeth with his will. Whose mesures he knowth, (of mans mesurs) least ill. But: for such false mesurers: as I haue bene: This mesure is made, and dewlie put in vre. At hands of the great god, oft directlie sene. Right mesure motun, for wrong motun mesure. And (oftimes) he doth his instruments procure As now this maide: right mesurer to me is, As I to other, haue mesurde wrong ere this. This declaracion: one part of these thre, What I haue partlie bene, hath made you here, Whereby: what case I am in, here you se. Which sight and hereing, maie be mirror clere: To looke in: all times of the daie and the yere. For spiders hie: and spiders vnderneth. To kepe with life, that I haue lost with deth: And so to do, I shall you all exhort. And first my sonne, mark mine aduice to thee, (That shall succede me streight in place of such port, As I first began: in superiorite.) In few woords (which smart small time limitth me, For the which while (my child to me most dere:) Thy weeping leaue, and ley thine eare to here. Those things: that thou hast herd me here declare, By which: thou seest thy father cast awaie, To saue thy selfe (my child) se thou prepare: To flee the same: by temperate stedie stay. The contrarie of my demenure ay: Shall ay defend thee so in euerie case, As thou both loued and drad, shall kepe thi plase. Against my sotletee, vse thou simplicitee. Against my wrong vsurping, vse thou right. Against my pride, vse thou humilitee. Against my wrath, vse charite: in sight. Against my hate, in loue haue thou delight. Against these ills: and other folowing mee, Note these next ills: not to folow, but to flee. Wheare truth is taken treason: and traitors in trust: Wheare faith is framd fancie: and fancie feind feith: Where losels ouer lords: ley lawes at their lust: Where witlesse: as wiseste: the wittie out weith: Where mercie to the meeke: meare malice dismeith: Where dawcocks: in doctrine: haue dominacion, There doth deuision, bring desolacion. Let truth be the bage, in whom thou trust dost take. Let not firme faith be left: for fikill fancie, Let rewld lords: rewle rewlesse losels, when they crake. Let wise wisdom, ouer wey witlesse follie. Let malice passe: vse mesurable mercie. Let thunlearnd: in doctrine: to the learnd: giue plase. Let pastors be plaste, as I place them in case. In place of a shepherd, place not a shepe. In place of a shepe, place not a shephard. In no place: place a wolfe, the flocke to kepe: The sheepe or the wolfe, to the shepherds place prefard: By faintnesse: or fercenesse, the flocke must be mard. Place thou thy shepherds: such shepherds to be, As from the sheepe: and wolfe, vse the meane decre. Offenders penitent (for offences past, Sauing of whom: offendth not the standing state, Nor encorageth other: to offend the more fast) Correct, as mercie maie rigor moderate. But to this, make this a ground inuiolate. Upon sturdie stif standers: in violensie, Draw thy sword of iustice, sharpned sharplie. And marke (my son) these points that I now cum to: In commun order, of thy gouerning. Who: honestlie doth, as other honest do: And saith as those honest saie: or saith nothing, Axe him not what he thinkth, for marke this othing: Whose deede and his thought: repungnantlie varie, His woord and his thought: iar likewise contrarie. Loue to be loued, and hate to be hated. Of those that loue good: and hate ill, otherwise, Hauing hate of thill: for iustice iustlie rated, Hate so, be thou glad to haue, and by iustice, Continew that hate: in insessant sise. In whom (by their fauts) to thee fautlesse it drawse: To continew: by their continewed cause, Touching right or wrong: of both must thou choose one, As thus: eyther to do wrong: or to take wrong, Rather take it then do it: se thou do none. The wrong that I haue done (the flies here among) Of myne ill: their ill: hath bene partlie a long. Answere mine ill all (alas) streight must I do. And as much of theirs, as mine hath forst them to. Of spider or flie: sewde to: for ought in grant, Ere thou graunt, loke what, where, &amp; why thou grauntest it But graunts once past thee (at suters sutes instant,) Performe them full: without restreint anie whit. Performance of promise, perfitelie doth knit: Such credence: to all: (they performing the same) As winth them fast freendship, and perpetuall fame. Thy councell choose, in these condiscions bent. Few, wise, secret, expert, temperate, and trew. Satiffide with sufficiencie, and diligent. All sale of iustice: and all offers teschew: That shall to thee, or commun welth hindrance brew, Their taking wherof: seming winning to bee: May leese them with all theirs, and all thine with thee. Here haue I geuen thee son: such exortacion, As weake wit: and short time will suffer in mee. Which: if thou vse, at thy fathers contemplacion, Behold then (my son) thyne owne prosperitee. Yf not, behold thy fathers aduersitee. As rightlie and rightfully on thee to light, As on thy father, thou seest it now light right. Now: to you of his counsell: marke what I deuies. In you, lithe the putting in vre of all this. You are his hands, his feete, his eares, and his iyes: Hering, feeling, or seeing, in him small is: To walke or to woorke with: you woorking amis: You are the myrrors: that all lookers looke in. As you woorke, they woorke: but you must first begin, In which woorke, this walke, I exorte you to take. Walke in amite, woorke in vnite. The answere of suters, expeditelie make. Serch their subiestions: how they maie agree: To be graunted, with honorable honeste. Offenders against you, when ye will chalenge, Neuer draw his sword: your quarels to reuenge. These be the great grounds: presentlie brought in minde. They passing two parts: of my promised thre. Me to declare, you to exort, in such kinde, As maie show cause of repentance in me, For ils past: and for thills to cum: in ye, Warning to a voide. thirdli and lastlie now, To witnesse my submission, I shall pray you. First to the great god, I humblie and wholie: Submitte me: euine so beseching his mercie: For all my great sin: and all offensife follie: Against him committed. Secondarilie: Of all the whole worlde here: I generallie, Axe forgeuenesse. Where: and in what: mine offence: To craue forgeuenesse: chargith my conscience, Thirdlie (and speciallie) good maistres maide: Your displeasure toward me: to bring appeased, I praye: your beningnite to be displaide, To forgiue my gilt: which hath you displeased, And not onlie displeased, but diseased. Namelie now: in streyning your arms long and small, To clense your window, of vncumlie copwebs all. Fourthlie and finallie, remission sought: By submission, to all spiders and flise: That I in this window haue offended ought: In taking or geuing the hooles in such sise: Or stretched my copwebs here: in such wide wise: As streightned anie part: of their lawfull right, Of them, on knees: I praye forgeuenesse in sight. Here end I: sauing six woords here to be saide: Unto my child: I: (him in mine arms hauing:) Pronounsed in your hering (good maistres maide:) Your lisence wherto, is mine humble crauing. Without woord of anie ill, in deprauing. Content (quoth she) wherwith in arms he tooke him, Saying these woordes, while she did ouer looke him. After a few wofull woordes of the spider had to his sonne (they bothe claspynge eche other in armes verie naturally) he vysseth and blisseth him. Wherewyth that sonne with all the twelue spiders dolefullie departe from the spider. Cap. 93. Oh depe desired sight, of thee my childe dere: Behold thy father, how he beholdeth thee. To thy mother, and brother, thou shalt appere: After this weeping time: worne out of you three, To your comforts oftimes: but no time more to me, Our departings differ, nothing more (vnneth) You fro me to life, I from you to death. Now here in sight, as I should neuer be hence. Streight hence from sight, as I had neuer bene here. Well: farewell: vse to thy mother obedience. To thy brother, let brotherlie loue appere. Commend me to them both (my Iuels dere) I blisse thee: kisse thou me: they did so: and so, Lothlie he losed his arms, and leete him go. The mayde (appeering as woe to distroye the spider as he is to be dystroyde) wyth her foote presseth hym to death. Cap. 94. The water ran downe the cheekes, of them both two: The maide pitteing both, wept as fast thaie. But for that she must do: more then she wold do, The spider had bene forgeeuen, and gone his waie. But they gone weeping awaie, (without delaie:) The spider laying prostrate: she thervpon, Setting her foote on him, he was foorthwith gon. The mayde hath before her the twelue spiders and the twelue flies that had bene before in place. And vpon her show that all harms doone by those generacions is growne by my spider, she fynally deuiseth full redresse in poynting them to grow to order. Cap. 95. Vppon this execucion done, she hath now: Before her, these twelue spiders with those twelue flise That erst weare there: they erst mensioned to you. Unto which nombre, she did theare deuise, Certaine precepts geeuen: in woords weightie and wise, Which to repeate: as rightlie as I can, I will. And in this wise her tale began. To traine the time and tarie you (quoth she) In talke of your forefauts, folli it weare. The smart: both doth and will, still tell it ye. But what thing brought that smart: eche when and wheare) That: heare to here, eche one ley to his eare. Which thing brieflie to tell: brief end to forder, Was onlie in you all, this thing: misorder. As god orderlie created creatures all: So weare they created, to orderlie entent. To vse them selues, ech creature in his call. Of which created sort: the creator ment, Spiders and flies twayne, to order to relent. The lacke wherof on your sides: witnesseth weele. To haue wrought displeasure on all sides, euerideele. On all sides I saie: meaning these sides therby. Your sides, my side, my master and masters side. First for your sides: the smart showth feelingly. On my side: such rebukes as I abide, Of them for you seeming your fauts to hide. And on their sides: their most displesaunt sight, To se spiders and flies, out of order quight. Spiders spinning in windows welnie, in their facis. Spightfullie haue sponne. And flies innumerablie: To blow their meate: haue made their commun tracis, Thus: lacke of order on your two sides proue I: To haue brought all sides: to liue displesantlie. To my masters and maistres greefe, greatli growne. Whose which greefe: to me, is more then mine owne. By whose appointment vnder them as now: I (hauing here the cure,) must haue the care. To assine redresse: for which I sent for you. To you: and to all yours in you, to declare: Order, to ease all spiders and flies that are. And all other: such as haue bene anoide, By lacke of order, which ye ere this distroide. That spiders and flies: are the creatures of god, And all his creatures: in their creacion good, I know and aknowledge. Or els gods forbod. I hate neither the spiders: nor the flies brood. I loue all: as behoueth maidenlie mood. All his creatures in an order, we must loue: That orderlie vse them selues: as doth behoue. And such as be ill: yet maie we not hate: The persons, but the ill in the persons seene. This learnd I of a preacher: that preached late: And of my selfe (I thanke god) I haue not beene: So much giuen to hate (anie person I meene Be they spiders: be they flies: what euer they be:) But I can vse all, as standth with charite. And charitablie such an order to set: To set you in rest: and the sayde rest therby, All fauts in all past: to forgeue and forget, That will I you all to do. And orderly: Echone to vse him selfe ordinarilie: And eche vse other: in euerie kind of cause, As thold knowne well ordered custome, dewli drawse. And that is this: ye spiders in tip of top: Or in top sides of windows: copwebs shall make Aboue the rech of my broome: to crush or crop Anie part therof: not set like an ale stake, Proudlie to brag your selues: and bring flies in brake, But in place to lie: most hie and most hiddin. Spiders thus plaste, customs order hath biddin. Flies in the bodie of the window shall passe. Not by thousands at once: sediciouslie, But thorough hooles of lattes: or broken glasse: Not blowing hensforth (so sawimalapertlie:) My masters and maistres meate: as yeares latlie: They haue done, but passe and repasse in nombre And vsage such as shall no house accombre. This auncient order (in few woordes) here geeuene, Is all that I axe: in you to be vsed. In lacke wherof, in all sorow you are dreeuene, In vse therof, in solace you in clused. Mysorder: bringing you thus confused, Let order: by your leauing of misorder, Quietnesse on your sides, and all sides forder. By order (from misorder) you to redeeme, (From sorowes of all sorts to solace so sorted,) Is cause of my cuming. Not by meanes extreeme, But by most milde meanes: that maie be imported: In order to set you: and se you comforted To kepe order. Wherin you obeying mee, We may liue in loue all: eche in his degree. Eche in his degree (I saie) mark that point well. Your lacke of liuing so, (ye see) mard you all. Cheeflie you spiders: vsurping to excell: In gouernance: out of your place naturall. Which for few yeares past, brought and kept flies so thrall, That you (welnie) brought flies: to graunt to agree. You: as head gouernous generall bee. In which vsurpacion: ye offended, Nature, reason, my master, maistres, and me. Gouernours, nature hath commonlie bended: Ouer such kinds to gouerne, as them selues be. Beast ouer beasts, foull ouer fowls, as we se Man ouer men. And in feare and aw is than, Thunreasonable beaste, to reasonable man. Nature ye offend: in planted plaine profe here, To take rule of other kinds, then your kind is, Reason: ye offend, in that ye here appere, To take vpon you, the vse of mine offis. Me: ye offend in the same: and vnto this, My master and maistres ye offend. As thus. Hed rule here, is their gift by customs discus. But leaue this, and take that: mine order erst told. Keepe you your places, and let me keepe mine. As nature: and custom: willeth you of old. While reason: and custom: do me clere encline: My masters and maistres will: to woork in fine: As I vnder them: and you vnder me, May louelie liue (I saie) ech in dew degree. The spiders and flies: perceyuing by her staie: That she (in this matter) had saide what she wold, All reioysing, one spider assinde to saie: In such maner: as good maner: might him bold, This effect in these woords, to this maide he told. At beginning of whose talke she set her iye, And layde her eare toward him diligentlie. The twelue spiders and twelue flies hauyng herde theyr order set by the mayde, they thankefullie receyue it. And vpon her commaundement to them, to put thys order in vre amonge all spyders and flies, they ioyfullye departe that commaundement to fulfill. Cap. 96. Most excelent maide, and maistres of ours. Your milde and motherlie precepts: geuen vs thus, In order old: reuiued now: at hand of yours, Lack wherof (as ye saide) the sorowes in vs: Haue witnest that, of them, the cause in discus. Your woords wherin told: to our deedes therin felt, Do instruct vs, with a doble witnesse delt. And double or treble (yea quatreble) cause: With manie causes mo: then I can now tell: Haue we: to kepe order as your will vs drawse, Spiders and flies haue liued, like as in hell. Sins new misorder: did thold order expell, Thus: our bound dutie obaiyng your precept, Is your pleasure, but our profits, to se kept. Which: I promise for vs, and all spiders els: To be obserued. As ferfoorth as we maie, And I (quoth one flie) for all flies as he tels: Promise: for order to walke the same waie. Reioysing all, that euer we saw this daie. Praying the great god: for you now and euer, In prosperus prosperite, to perseuer. Well freends (quoth the maide) to enter order now: Depart. And plant this in all spiders and fliese. In top of windows, spiders exercise you. And flies the hooles: moderateli excercise. In most ioyfull ioy, that both sorts can deuise. From thence most ioyfullie: they all flang and flew, While the mayde vsde her will there, as doth ensew, The spiders and flies beynge now absent, The mayde sweepyth the wyndow cleane in euerie place. As far as her brome and arme wyll stretch, which doone she departeth. Cap. 97 The spiders and flies (for the time) being gon, The maide swept that window, cleane in all places, In all corners: that her broome might light vpon, Ech copweb (with her broome) she full defaces: No wem seene: in casemunds, nor casemund cases. Upon her cleare clensing wherof: out went she, And in cam I, her woorkmanship there to se. The maide being gone, the auctor c?meth in. And vpon hys beholding the wyndow fayre and cleane swept wythoute anie comberus copwebs or excessiue flockes of flies he departeth. Cap. 98. Beholding the window: seeing euerie roome: Cleane and emptie, saue three flies amid that plat: And in the top (without reche of the maids broome) Corners of copwebs vnneth sene, and to that: All thinges in quiet case: so that I could nat Of anie matter: be anie furder winner, I went from the window, to the boorde to dinner. FINIS. The conclusion with an exposission of the Auctor touching one peece of the latter part of this parable. I haue, (good readers) this parable here pende: (After olde beginning) newly brought to ende. The thing, yeres mo then twentie since it begoon. To the thing: yeres mo then ninetene, nothing doon. The frewte was grene: I durst not gather it than, For feare of rotting: before riping began. The losse, (it on the frewterers hande lying:) Had (in that mistery) mard his occupying. This worke (among my poore workes) thus hath it past: Begon with the first, and ended with the last. At ende wherof (as at beginning) I pray. All readers that reade it (in al that we may.) Ech one reader: to scan this parable so, As our most scanning: diligently may go: (In speech of spiders and flies fautes: here showne:) To considerate weying, of fautes of our owne. And them (by grace) tamend, for concord growing, As spiders and flies: grow to, here in showing. But, fauts and fauters: erst repented, and past, Which fauts (I hope) none: on him self can now cast: Figured here in the spiders cruelte: Touching deedes and deathes of those: that so past be: Let vs rather (when memorie them to mind calls,) Lament their false facktes: then reioyce their foule falls, And praie for them, as we hope they pray for vs, That they and we: by goddes mercifull discus, May (after strife together in life carnall,) Liue and loue together: in life eternall. And for the chief spider and flie: vnderstand: Spider that dide: and flie that scapte, at maydes hand, As in that figure: both: most charitablie: Thone in deede dieing: thother redie to die, So should we: not onlie die, but also liue. As gods preseptes, (paine of endelesse deth) do giue. Ye se also: that this fygure here implies, For strife in windowes: betweene spiders and flies, The plat of all the world, and people therin. In which world: which people: if all now begin: And hensforth: endeuer them deuring theyr liues: By counsell of those two: to cut of all striues: By cuting of: all cause of strife: in all parties: As they both: (eche in his last tale) did deuise, The first tale: in chapter four score and eight here: The second: in foure score and twelue; doth a pere: Thaduice in both turnd to: it to here and hold: Turning their persons to oures (in those tales told,) Then shall we first se, and after feele: what frewte, Our right doing (against wrong) shall execute. Which: since ye maie turne: and behold as a glasse, Tedius Iteracion therof I let passe. As I (for tediousnesse and other causes,) Omit (to remit) the nombre of clauses. To those: learnd and geuen (in enterpretacion,) More them am I, vnto moralisacion. I leaue to the learnd: the corps of this matter: How beete (as I can) I craue leaue to smatter: In vttring my fancie: vnder submission, Touching the taking of one exposission: In one peece herof: one sence tenterpretate: Of apt aplication to sence literate: In this the last saide part, of this saide fygure. That maide I meane: putting her office in vre. Sweping downe copwebs in euerie border, That she (in that window) saw set out of order. Setting all flies at their lawfull libertie, And spiders also, tavoyde all ieobertie. They bilding in windowes: without her broms rech, (Where bilding within it: brought much of this brech) Keeping them selues within their boundes: as they ought, Harme she none did them, none saide, nor none thought. But spiders: hauing past their boundes: as they had,) And flies: hauing flowne more brode: then order bad, Thone: to nie her masters and maistres iye showing: Thother: her masters and maistres meate blowing: She thought it her dutie: it being her charge, To do sum execucion: for warning large: Both to spiders and flies: the flockes euerichone, By executing of spiders, onlie one. And: saue custom of iustice: forst her therto, Loth was she: execusion on him to do. Her brome not sword of rigor, (doble edgid blade) But the branche of mercie: that milde maiden made. Finallie: vpon her benigne behauer: Appeasing all this furie: with all this fauer, In spiders and flies: without stripes to stint strife, All plaste in right place: to place prosperus life, Ech one in him selfe: in most ioyfull ioy ioyde, And eche one to other, their ioyes they imploide, All ioying in her: as their redempsion, Of rest, long erst had in exsempsion. All bent (as all weare bounde) in all that they maie, That maide (in her office) to loue and obaie. Wherwith: as this parable here taketh ende, So I: (with a few wordes therin) an ende intende. Of this last peece: pleine interpretacion, Lighteth in the lap of imaginacion. Which: of force, in weying the sence literall, Clerelie conueithe the sence alligoricall, To our sufferaigne Ladie, Queene Marie, and maide. At gods bringing whom to her crowne, may be laide: Our lyke strife rissen: and more then like to rise, Then showth here risen: betweene spiders and flies. Whose sworde like a brome: that swepth out filth cleane: Not a sword that fileth the house: by blodie meane, This mercifull maiden tooke in hand to sweepe, Her window: this realme. Not to kill, but to keepe: All in quiet. On her bringing vs therto, As that maide (all spiders and flies) showth to do. And as vnder that mayde: spider dide but one, So vnder this maide: saue one, (in effect) none, And as that one: vnder that one maide did die: Repentaunt, so this other repentauntlie: Under this other maide: the deth meeklie tooke. All sin: with all sinfull errours, he forsooke. Of god: crauing forgiuenesse principallie, And then of the world. And most speciallie: Of this mayde his mastres. Who (clerlie) him forgaue, As that maide did that spider, when he did craue, And as that maide: lothlie forst by iust custum: Was dreuin to bring that one: texcucion to cum, So this maide: saue like that maide: by force was dreuine, Was with that maide: (for pitie) more then euine. And as that maidins most quarell was addikt: For that: spiders and flies: in that window kikt: Against the will of her master and maistres, So did this maide: her cheefe quarell addres: To vs (or to such of vs) as the presept: Of her master and maistres: had not kept, And as that maide tooke those fautes much more to hart: In respect of her masters and maistres part: Then for her owne part, (her part being not small: In that the redres: she was charged with all,) So: vnder her master and maistres, this meyde: Being theyr like instrument: to se thinges weyde, She weyde that. With more greefe to se them offendid, Then for ought: that on her owne part dependid. Her master Christ, the head master principall. Her maistres, mother hollie church catholicall. And as that one maide: with that one stroke of her broome: Clensed her window clere in euerie roome: Setting flies at liberte: in their right rate: Plasing spiders likewise in accustumd state: Poynting both partes: path of direct direction: To trace and treade in: as welthes protection, So this one mayde: with this one stroke of her sword: From long thrall thraldom, hath set vs clere a bord. Poynting vs our places (and pathes) of old knowne: Great gides, both to gostlie and worldlie welth growne. Thus fer goth this figure: and this exposiscion: Betweene that mayde, and this maide. The condiscion, On her part fulfild. Whervpon let vs here Plaie our parts in this part: all parts to apere: To this maide, as spiders and flies to that maide. Let our baners of obedience be displaide. Of loue, the bage of reioysing, the right roote. And of our owne welthis, the right and full boote. Loue we her, and obey we her, as we ought: And also our suffrayne Lorde: Philip: to her brought: By god: as god brought her to vs. Which twaine: Conioyned one: in matrimoniall trayne: Both one also: in auctorite regall: These two thus made one: bothe one here we call. Which two thus one, reioyse we eueriechone. And these two thus one, obey we all as one. Effectuallie: as those spiders and flies, Figuratiuelie, that one recongnies, Beseching god that brought them, to keepe them here: In long prosperus raigne. And of his mercie mere: So to blisse vs: that on this blessed stocke, He bring such impes: as ouer their faythfull stocke: As their progenitors do raygne presentlie, They (after them) maie raigne perpetuallie. And for gift of these two thus one: to vs geuine, To yeld the three and one thankes: (as we are dreuine, And also them, conclude we this euen thus. Thanke we god for them, and god and them for vs. FINIS.</field>
