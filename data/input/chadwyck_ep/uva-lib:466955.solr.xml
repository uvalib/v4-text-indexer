      <field name="fulltext">THE PROLOGUE TO THE CANTERBURY TALES; MODERNIZED By R. H. HORNE. PROLOGUE TO THE CANTERBURY TALES. When that sweet April showers with downward shoot The drought of March have pierc'd unto the root, And bathÃ©d every vein with liquid power, Whose virtue rare engendereth the flower; When Zephyrus also with his fragrant breath InspirÃ©d hath in every grove and heath The tender shoots of green, and the young sun Hath in the Ram one half his journey run, And small birds in the trees make melody, That sleep and dream all night with open eye; So nature stirs all energies and ages That folks are bent to go on pilgrimages, And palmers for to wander thro' strange strands, To sing the holy mass in sundry lands: And more especially, from each shire's end Of England, they to Canterbury wend, The holy blissful martyr for to seek, Who hath upheld them when that they were weak. It fell, within that season on a day In Southwark, at the Tabard as I lay, Ready to wend upon my pilgrim route To Canterbury, with a heart devout, At night was come into that hostelry Well nine-and-twenty in a company, Of sundry folk who thus had chanced to fall In fellowship, and pilgrims were they all, That now to Canterbury town would ride. The chambers and the stables they were wide, And all of us refresh'd, and of the best. And shortly when the sun was gone to rest, So had I spoken with them every one, That I was of their fellowship anon, And made them promise early for to rise To take our way there, as I you apprise. But ne'ertheless, while I have time and space, Ere that I further in this story pace, Methinks it were accordant with good sense To tell you the condition and pretence Of each of them, so as it seem'd to me; And which they wereâof what kind, and degree; And eke in what array that they were in: And at a knight, then, will I first begin. A Knight there was, and that a worthy man, Who from the hour on which he first began To ride out, vowed himself to chivalry, Honour and truth, freedom and courtesy. In his lord's war right worthy had he shone, And thereto riddenânone had further gone, In Christian, and in Heathen land, no less; And ever honour'd for his worthiness. At Alexandria was he when 'twas won. Full oft the wassail board he had begun, Above the bravest warriors out of Prusse; In Lithuania had he serv'd, and Russe; No Christian man so oft of his degree. At Algeziras, in Granada, he Had join'd the siege; and ridden in Belmarie: At Layas was he, and at Satalie When they were won; and, borne on the Great Sea, At many a noble fight of ships was he. In mortal battles had he been fifteen, And fought for our true faith, at Tramissene, In the lists thriceâand always slain his foe. And this same worthy Knight had been also In Anatolia sometime with a lord, Fighting against the foes of God his word; And evermore he won a sovereign prize. Though thus at all times honour'd, he was wise, And of his port as meek as is a maid. He never yet a word discourteous said In all his life to any mortal wight: He was a very perfect gentle knight. But for to tell you of his staid array,â His horse was good, albeit he was not gay. He wore a fustian cassock, short and plain, All smutch'd with rust from coat of mail, and rain. For he was late return'd; and he was sage, And cared for nought but his good pilgrimage. His son, a young Squire, with him there I saw; A lover and a lusty bachelor; With locks crisp curl'd, as they'd been laid in press: Of twenty years of age he was, I guess. He was in stature of the common length, With wondrous nimbleness, and great of strength: And he had been in expeditions three, In Flanders, Artois, and in Picardy; And borne him well, tho' in so little space, In hope to stand fair in his lady's grace. Embroider'd was he, as it were a mead All crowded with fresh flowers, white and red. Singing he was, or fluting all the day: He was as fresh as is the month of May. Short was his gown, with sleeves right long and wide Well could he sit his horse, and fairly ride. He could make songs, and letters well endite, Joust and eke dance, and portraits paint, and write. His amorous ditties nightly fill'd the vale; He slept no more than doth the nightingale. Courteous he was, modest and serviceable, And carv'd before his father at the table. A Yeoman had he; and no page beside: It pleased him, on this journey, thus to ride; And he was clad in coat and hood of green. A sheaf of peacock arrows, bright and keen, Under his belt he bare full thriftily: Well could he dress his tackle yeomanly; His arrows droopÃ©d not with feathers low; And in his hand he bare a mighty bow. His head was like a nut, with visage brown. Of wood-craft all the ways to him were known. An arm-brace wore he that was rich and broad, And by his side a buckler and a sword; While on the other side a dagger rare Well sheathed was hung, and on his breast he bare A large St. Christopher of silver sheen. A horn he had; the baldric was of green. A forester was he truly, as I guess. There was, likewise, a Nun, a Prioress, That of her smiling was full simple and coy. Her greatest oath was but âby Saint Eloy;â And she was namÃ©d Madam Eglentine. Right well she sang the services divine, EntunÃ©d in her nose with accent sweet; And French she spake full properly and neat, After the school of Stratford, at Bow town, For French of Paris was to her unknown, At table she was scrupulous withal; No morsel from her lips did she let fall, Nor in her sauce would dip her fingers deep. Well could she carry a morsel, and well keep, That not a drop e'er fell upon her breast. In courtesy her pleasure much did rest. Her dainty upper-lip she wiped so clean That in her cup there was no farthing seen Of grease, when she had drunk; and for her meat Full seemly bent she forward on her seat. And of a truth she was of great disport; Pleasant to all and amiable of port. It gave her pain to counterfeit the ways Of court; its stately manner and displays; And to be held in distant reverence. But for to tell you of her consciÃ©nce, She was so tender and so piteous, She would shed tears if that she saw a mouse Caught in a trap, if it were hurt or dead. She had some small hounds, which she always fed With roasted meat, and milk, and fine wheat bread; But sore wept she if one of them were dead, Or if men with a stick e'er struck it smart: And all was consciÃ©nce and tender heart. Full seemly was her kerchief crimp'd across; Her nose well cut and long; eyes grey as glass; Her mouth was small, and thereto soft and red, And certainly a forehead fair she had: It was almost a span in breadth, I trow; And truly she was not of stature low. Most proper was her cloak, as I was ware. Of coral small about her arm she bare Two strings of beads, bedizen'd all with green, And thereon hung a broach of gold full sheen, On which was graven first a crownÃ©d A, And after âAmor vincit omnia.â Another Nun, also, with her had sheâ Who served instead of chaplainâand Priests three. A Monk there was, of skill and mastery proved; A bold hand at a leap, who hunting loved: A manly man, to be an abbot able. Full many a dainty horse had he in stable, And when he rode, men might his bridle hear, Gingling in a whistling wind as clear And eke as loud, as doth the chapel bell Where reign'd he lord o'er many a holy cell. The rules of Saint Maure and Saint Benedict, Because that they were old and something strict, This sturdy monk let old things backward pace, And of the new world follow'd close the trace. He rated not the text at a pluck'd hen, Which saith that hunting 'fits not holy men, Or that a monk beyond his bricks and mortar Is like a fish without a drop of waterâ That is to say, a monk out of his cloister:â Now this same text he held not worth an oyster! And I say his opinion was not bad. Why should he study and make himself half mad Upon a book in cloister ever to pore, Or labour with his hands, and dig and bore As Austin bids? How shall the world be served? Let the world's work for Austin be reserved. Therefore our monk spurr'd on, a jolly wight. Greyhounds he kept, as swift as bird of flight: In riding hard and hunting for the hare, Was all his joy; for no cost would he spare. I saw his large sleeves trimm'd above the hand With fur, and that the finest of the land; And for to keep his hood beneath his chin, He had of beaten gold a curious pin: A love-knot at the greater end there was. His head was bald, and shone like any glass; And eke his face, as it had been anoint. He was a lord full fat, and in good point. His eyes were deep and rolling in his head, Which steam'd as doth a furnace melting lead. His boots were supple, his horse right proud to see; Now certainly a prelate fair was he: He was not pale as a poor pining ghost. A fat swan loved he best of any roast. His palfrey was as brown as is a berry. A Friar there was, a wanton and a merry; Licensed to beg, a wondrous solemn man. In all the orders four there's none that can So much of dalliance wrap in language fair. Full many a marriage had he brought to bear For women young, and paid the cost with sport. Unto his order he was rare support. Right well beloved, in fellowship was he With jolly franklins all, and yeomanry; And eke with women, of each town the flower, For in confession he possess'd a power More than a curate, as himself could state, Being of his order a licentiate. Full sweetly would he hear confession made; Pleasantly was his absolution said. He was an easy man in penance naming, And knew that alms fell heavy from light blaming; Since to an order poor when much is given, It proves the culprit has been rightly shriven; For if a sinner pay dear for his bent, He knew the man must certainly repent; And many a man so hard is of his heart, He will not weep, although his soul should smart; Therefore, instead of prayers and groans and tears, Men must give money to the poor fryÃ©res. His tippet always was stuff'd full of knives, And pins, as presents meant for handsome wives. And certainly his note was blithe and gay; Well could he sing, and on the psaltery play. In songs and tales the prize o'er all bore he. His neck was white as is the fleur de lis. Strong was he also, as a champion, And knew the taverns well in every town, And every ostler there, and tapster gay, Much more than he knew beggars by the way. For unto such a worthy man as he, Nothing is gain'd from his good faculty By giving to such lazars countenance: It is not rightâno interest can advanceâ To deal with knaves and scrubs who have so little; But all with rich, and those who sell good victual. Therefore 'bove all where profit might arise, Courteous he was, and full of service wise. There was no man one half so virtuous: He was the cleverest beggar in all his house; And farm'd a certain district, as in grant. None of his brethren came within his haunt. And though a widow scarcely had a shoe, So pleasant was his âIn principio,â He still would have a farthing ere he went. His harvest was far better than his rent. And rage he could, as it had been a whelp, In love-days Days which were appointed for the settlement of disputes in the most loving manner.âBracton, l. v. fol. 369.; yet he often gave great help: For there was he, not like a cloisterer frore, With threadbare cape, as suits a scholar poor, But he was like a bishop or a pope. Of double worsted was his semi-cope, Round as a new bell from the moulder's press. Somewhat he lispÃ©d for his wantonness, To make his English sweet upon his tongue. And in his harping, when that he had sung, His eyes they twinkled in his head aright, As do the stars upon a frosty night. And Hubert was this worthy friar's name. Next him, with forked beard, a Merchant came, In motley dress, and high on horse he sat. He wore a stately Flanders' beaver hat. His boots, that fitted close, were of neat make; His reasons very solemnly he spake, Sounding the increase of his gains alwÃ¡y. He wish'd the channel had no dues pay, Running 'twixt Middleburgh and Overwell. Well could he French crowns by exchanges sell. All chances he with his shrewd wits beset, And no one knew that he was much in debt: So steadily he govern'd all his moves, With bargains, and with bills that work'd in grooves. In truth he was a worthy man withal, But sooth to say, his name I can't recall. A Clerk there was, from Oxford, in the press, Who in pure logic placed his happiness. His horse was lean as any garden rake; And he was not right fat, I undertake; But hollow look'd, and sober, and ill fed. His uppermost short cloak was a bare thread, For he had got no benefice as yet, Nor for a worldly office was he fit. For he had rather have at his bed's head Some twenty volumes, clothed in black or red, Of Aristotle and his philosophy, Than richest robes, fiddle, or psaltery. But though a true philosopher was he, Yet had he little gold beneath his key; But every farthing that his friends e'er lent, In books and learning was it always spent; And busily he pray'd for the sweet souls Of those who gave him wherewith for the schools. He bent on study his chief care and heed. Not a word spake he more than there was need, And this was said with form and gravest stress, And short and quick, full of sententiousness. Sounding in moral virtue was his speech, And gladly would he learn, and gladly teach. A Serjeant of the Law, wise, wary, arch, Who oft had gossip'd long in the church porch, Was also there, full rich of excellence. Discreet he was and of great reverence; For such he seem'd, his words were all so wise. Justice he was full often in assize; By patent and commission from the crown, For his keen science and his high renown. Of fees and robes he many had I ween: So great a purchaser was nowhere seen. All was fee simple to him, in effect; His rightful gainings no one could suspect. So busy a man as he no circuit has; And yet he seemÃ©d busier than he was. He had at tip of tongue all cases plain, With all the judgments, since King William's reign. He likewise could indite such perfect law, None in his parchments could pinch out a flaw: And every statute he knew well by rote. He rode but homely in a medley coat, With band of twill'd silk round the loins made fast: On his array no more time shall I waste. A Franklin A large Freeholder, and wealthy country gentleman. in this company appear'd: White as a daisy was this Franklin's beard. With sanguine hues did his complexion shine. Well loved he in the morn a sop in wine. His days he gave to pleasure, every one; For he was Epicurus's own son, Who held the opinion that a life of bliss Was verily man's perfect happiness. An householder of great extent was he; He was St. Julian âSt. Julian was eminent for providing his votaries with good lodgings and accommodations of all sorts.ââTyrwhitt. in his own countrÃ©y. With bread and ale his board was always crown'd; A better cellar no where could be found. His pantry never was without baked meat, And fish and flesh, so plenteous and complete, It snow'd within his house of meat and drink. Of all the dainties that a man could think, After the sundry seasons of the year, His meats thus changed he, and his supper cheer. Full many a partridge fat had he in mew, And many a bream and many a jack in stew. Woe to his cook, unless his sauces were Made piquant rich, and ready all his gear. His table with repletion heavy lay Amidst his hall, throughout the feast-long day. At sessions there was he both lord and sire. Full often time he had been Knight o' the Shire. A dagger, and a purse of netted silk, Hung at his girdle, white as morning milk. Sheriffâcomptrollerâmagistrate he'd been; A worthier franklin there was nowhere seen. A Haberdasher, and a Carpenter, A Weaver, Dyer, Tapster, eke were here; All in the self-same livery attired, And with a grave fraternity inspired. Right fresh and new their spruce appearance was: Their knives were not trickt out with common brass, But all with silver neatly overwrought; Their girdles and their pouches eke, methought. Each seem'd a worthy burgess fit and fair To sit in the guild hall on high-floor'd chair; And for the wisdom that his brain could plan Was well cut out to be an alderman. Enough for this they had of kine and rent, And very gladly would their wives assent, Or else they were to blame, I swear by Adam: 'Tis a fine thing to be entitled âMadamâ And foremost walk to fÃªtes, at eve or morn, And have a mantle royally up-borne. A Cook was carried with this pilgrim coil, The chickens and the marrow-bones to boil, And powder tarts, and frost the sweatmeats rare. To London ale, with one draught, he could swear. And he could roast, and seethe, and broil, and fry, Make pounded game soups, and well bake a pie. But great harm was itâas it seem'd to meâ That on his shin an angry sore had he. But for blanc-mange, he made that with the best. A Skipper was there, come from out the West, He was at Dartmouth born, for aught I know. He rode upon a hack-nag, anyhow, All in a coarse frock reaching to his knee. A dagger, hanging by a lace, had he About his neck, under his arm adown. The summer hot had made his hue all brown, And certainly he was a fellow good. Wine had he drawn right often from the wood In Bourdeaux docks, while that the dealers snored: For a nice conscience he cared not a cord. If that he fought, and had the higher hand, By water he sent them home to every land Verbatim from Chaucer, but the meaning is not very clear. Is it to be inferred that he drowned his piratical prisoners,ââevery landâ meaning the bottom of the sea? But of his craft to reckon well each tide, His inland streams, and unknown strands beside, His harbour, compass, moon, and gallant trim, 'Twixt Hull and Carthage there was none like him. Hardy he was, and very wise I reckon: With many a tempest had his beard been shaken. He knew well all the havens, as they were, From Gothland, to the Cape de Finistere, And every creek in Britain and in Spain: His jolly bark was call'd the âMagdelain.â A Doctor of Physic rode with us along; There was none like him in this wide world's throng, To speak of physic and of surgery; For he was grounded in astronomy. He very much prolong'd his patients' hours By natural magic; and the ascendant powers Of figures that he cast, his art could make Benign of aspect, for his patient's sake. He knew the cause of every malady, Were it of cold, or hot, or moist, or dry, And how engender'dâwhat the humours wereâ He was a very perfect practiser. The cause once known, and root of the disease, Anon he placed the sick man at his ease. Full ready had he his apothecaries To send him drugs and his electuaries, And each one made the other sure to win: Their friendship was no new thing to begin. Well the old Ãsculapius he knew, And Dioscorides, and Rufus too; Hali, and old Hippocrates, and Galen, Serapion, Rasis, and wise Avicen; Averroes, Damascene, and Constantin, Deep-seeing Bernard, Gatesden, Gilbertin. His diet by its nutriment weigh'd he, For to be charged with superfluity In meat and drink, had been to him a libel. His study was but little in the Bible. He was all clad in crimson and sky-grey, With thin silk lined, and lustrous taffeta. And yet he was but moderate in expence. He hoarded what he gain'd i' the pestilence; For gold in physic is a cordial oldâ Therefore the Doctor specially loved gold. There was from Bath a good Wife and a witty; But she was somewhat deaf, and that was pity. In the cloth trade such crowds unto her went, She beat the looms of Ypres and of Ghent. In all the parish good wife none was there That to mass-offering step before her dare; And if they did, certain so wrath was she That she at once forgot all charity. Her folded head-cloths were of finest ground; I durst swear almost that they weigh'd a pound, Which on the Sunday were upon her head. Her stockings fine were of a scarlet red, Full straightly tied, and shoes right fair and new. Bold was her face, and fair and red of hue. She was a worthy woman to the core: Five husbands had she brought from the church door; Not reckoning other company in youth: But there's no need to tell this now, in sooth. And thrice had she been at Jerusalem; She had pass'd over many a strange stream. Cologne she knew; Bologna, Rome, had seen; And in Galicia, at the shrine, had been. She had known much of journeying by the way. Her teeth had gaps between them, sooth to say. Upon an ambler easily she sat, With wimple large, and on her head an hat, As broad as is a buckler or a targe. A riding-skirt about her round hips large Was tied, and sharp spurs were on both her feet. In fellowship well could she laugh, and treat Of remedies of love she learnt by chance, For of that art she well knew the old dance. A good man of religion did I see, And a poor Parson of a town was he: But rich he was of holy thought and work. He also was a learned man, a clerk, And truly would Christ's holy gospel preach, And his parishioners devoutly teach. Benign he was and wondrous diligent, And patient when adversity was sent; Such had he often proved, and loath was he To curse for tythes and ransack poverty; But rather would he give, there is no doubt, Unto his poor parishioners about, Of his own substance, and his offerings too. His wants were humble, and his needs but few. Wide was his parishâhouses far asunderâ But he neglected nought for rain or thunder, In sickness and in grief to visit all The farthest in his parish, great and small; Always on foot, and in his hand a stave. This noble example to his flock he gave; That first he wrought, and afterwards he taught. Out of the Gospel he that lesson caught, And this new figure added he thereto,â That if gold rust, then what should iron do? And if a priest be foul, on whom we trust, No wonder if an ignorant man should rust: And shame it is, if that a priest take keep, To see an obscene shepherd and clean sheep. Well ought a priest to all example give, By his pure conduct, how his sheep should live. He let not out his benefice for hire, Leaving his flock encumber'd in the mire, While he ran up to London, to St. Paul's, To seek a well-paid chantery for souls, Or with a loving friend his pastime hold; But dwelt at home and tended well his fold, So that to foil the wolf he was right wary: He was a shepherd, and no mercenÃ¡ry. And though he holy was and virtuous, He was to sinful men full piteous; His words were strong, but not with anger fraught; A lore benignant he discreetly taught. To draw mankind to heaven by gentleness And good example, was his business. But if that any one were obstinate, Whether he were of high or low estate, Him would he sharply check with altered mien: A better parson there was no where seen. He paid no court to pomps and reverence, Nor spiced his conscience at his soul's expence That is, he did not embalm or preserve his conscience by sophistries and artificial moralities. But Jesus' lore, which owns no pride or pelf, He taughtâbut first he follow'd it himself. A Ploughman Ploughman here signifies a small farmer. hale, his brother, with him rode, Who of manure had spread full many a load. A right good, constant, labouring man was he, Living in peace and perfect charity. O'er all the world to God he gave his heart At all times, whether for his gain or smart; And next his neighbour as himself he held. He thresh'd, made dykes, he planted, or he fell'd, For Jesus' sake, in aid of each poor wight, And without hire, when it lay in his might. His tythes he also paid without a word, Both of his proper labour and his herd. In a short frock he rode upon a mare. A Miller and a Reve were also there; A Sompnour and a Pardonerâmaking fourâ A Manciple and myself: there were no more Reve, a steward; Sompnour, a summoner, the officer (now called an apparitor) who summoned delinquents to appear in ecclesiastical courts; Pardoner, one who sells pardons, or indulgences, from the Roman See; Manciple, the caterer or Steward of an Inn of Court. The Miller was a stout carl, deep of tones; Right large he was of brawn, and eke of bones, Which he proved well, for over all that came In wrestling he would bear away the ram. With shoulders broad and shortâa knob or gnarrâ There was no door but he 'd heave up the bar, Or break, by running at it with his head. His beard as any sow or fox was red, And thereto broad, as though it were a spade. Upon the tip-top of his nose he had A wart, and thereon stood a tuft of hairs, Red as the bristles of a wild sow's ears: His open nostrils they were black and wide. A sword and buckler bare he by his side. His mouth gaped like a furnace, red and great. He was a huge wag and enjoy'd his prate, Which mainly turn'd on sin and haunts of vice. He oft stole corn, and charged, for grinding, thrice. And yet he had a golden thumb, pardie! A white coat with a hood of blue had he. A bagpipe well he play'd with squeal and croon, And therewithal he brought us out of town. There was a courteous Manciple of a temple, And caterers all from him might take example, How to be wise in furnishing the board; For whether that he paid, or had it scored, He for his bargain would his time so bide That he was always on the safest side. Now is not that a sign of heaven's good grace, When one of such unlearn'd wit should out-pace The wisdom of a heap of learned men? Of gownsmen had he more than three times ten, Who were in law expert and curious; Of which there were a dozen in that house, Fit to be stewards of the rents and land Of any lord that dwelleth in EnglÃ¡nd;â And make him live well by his own estate In debtless honourâwere his squanderings great, Or let him live as sparely as he would; And all his shire be able to do good In any ills that fall to mortal lot:â And yet this Manciple made them fools, I wot. The Reve he was a slender choleric man. His beard he shaves as close as ever he can. His formal hair was shorn stiff round his ears; His crown was dock'd as a priest's front appears. Full long were both his spindle legs, and lean; Just like a walking-stickâno calf was seen. Well could he keep a garner and a bin; There was no auditor could on him win. He knew well by the drought and by the rain, The yielding of the seed and of the grain. His lordship's flocks, his dairy, and his herd, His swine, his horses, stores, and poultry-yard, Were wholly in this Reve's good governing, And 'twas his duty to give reckoning. Since that his lord was twenty years of age No one could find arrears upon his page. There was no bailiff, herdsman, groom, or hind, But he knew all his sleights, and how to find: They dreaded him as though he had been death. His dwelling-house stood fair upon a heath; With green trees all the place was in soft shade. A bargain better than his lord he made. Much riches had he privately in store. He subtilly pleas'd his lordship evermore, Who gave and lent him of his substance good: The Reve got thanksâbesides a coat and hood. In youth a good trade practis'd well had he, And was a clever hand at carpentry. This Reve upon a stallion sat, I wot; Of apple-spotted grey, and christen'd Scot. His sky-blue surcoat lengthily was made, And by his side he bare a rusty blade. Of Norfolk was this wight of whom I tell, Near to a town that was call'd Balderswell. Like to a friar his clothes were tuck'd about; And ever he rode the hindmost of the route. A Sompnour was there with us in that place, Who had a fire-red cherubin's large face; Pimpled and crusted rough, with close eyes narrow: As hot he was and gamesome as a sparrow. With scruffy eye-brows black, and blotch-bald beard, Of his grim visage children were sore afeard. There was no quicksilver, sugar of lead, nor brimstone, Borax, litharge, nor oil of tartarânoneâ Nor ointment, made to melt away or bite, That could relieve him of his tumours white, Or of the hot nobs sitting on his cheeks. Garlic he much loved, onions too, and leeks, And for to drink strong wine as red as blood. Then would he jest, and shout as he were mad; And when that he large draughts adown had pour'd, Then, save in Latin, he'd not speak a word. In sooth he knew a few termsâtwo or three, Which he had gather'd out of some decree: No wonder, for he heard it all the day. And certes, as ye know right well, a jay Can call out wat! as well as can the pope. But if you tried him further, by one trope, Then had he spent all his philosophyâ And, âQuÃ¦stio quid juris?â would he cry. He was a liberal varlet, and a kind; A better fellow could a man not find. And he would suffer for a quart of wine, An honest carl to have his concubine A twelvemonth, and excuse him at the full. Right craftily a pigeon could he pull; But a good fellow if he took in hand, He would soon teach him in no awe to stand, In any case, of the Archdeacon's curse. But if that a man's soul were in his purse, Then in his purse well punish'd should he be: For âPurse is the Archdeacon's hell,â said he. But well I wot he lied in act and deed. Of cursing ought each guilty man take heed. Curse kills the soul, as absolutions save it; Let him shun, also, a significavit. He ruled and managed, after his own guise, The boys, and girls too, of the diocese, And knew their ways, and counsels, to a thread. He had a garland set upon his head, Large as an ale-house sign hung on a stake. A buckler had he made him of a cake. With him there rode a courteous Pardoner Of Rounceval, his friend and his compeer; Who had arrived straight from the Roman See. Full loud he sung âCome hither, love, to me!â Our Sompnour's voice bore a stiff burden round; No trombone ever had so great a sound. This Pardoner had hair as yellow as wax, But smooth it hung as doth a strike of flax: By ounces hung the long locks that he had, And he therewith his shoulders overspread. Full thin it lay, in single shreds adown, But hood, for jollity, he would wear none; For it was truss'd up in his wallet close. He thought he rode all in new-fashion'd gloss: Dishevell'd, save his cap, he rode all bare. Such glaring eyes he had, as hath an hare. A picture of our Lord was sew'd on 's cap. His wallet lay before him in his lap, Brim full of pardons, come from Rome all hot. A voice he had as small as hath a goat. No beard had he, and none could ever have; As smooth it was as from the finest shave: He fitly rode a gelding or a mare. But of his craft, from Berwick unto Ware, You could not such another Pardoner trace; For in his pack he had a pillow-case, Which, as he said, was once our Lady's veil. He said he had a fragment of the sail Saint Peter held, when, as his heart misgave him Upon the sea, he pray'd our Lord to save him. He had a cross of mixt ore, set with stones, And in a glass-case treasured up pigs' bones. But with these relics rare, when that he found A parson poor, dwelling on rustic ground, He in a single day more money got Than the poor parson in two months, I wot. And thus with flattery, feints, and knavish japes, He made the parson and the people, his apes. But truly for to tell you all at last, He was in church a noble ecclesiast. Well could he read a lesson or a story, Yet best of all he sang an offertory, For well he knew when he that song had sung, That he must preach and polish up his tongue, To win the silver, as he right well could; Therefore he sang the merrier and loud. Now have I told you shortly in a clause, The estate, the array, the number, and eke the cause Why that assembled was this company In Southwark, at this goodly hostelry, Which was the Tabard call'd, hard by the Bell.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE REVE'S TALE; MODERNIZED BY R. H. HORNE. THE REVE'S PROLOGUE. When all had laugh'd their fill at this nice case Of Absalom and dexterous Nicholas Alluding to the âMiller's Tale,â which has rather offended the Reve, by reason that it ridiculed a worthy carpenter. Diverse folk diversely their comments made. But, for the most part, they all laugh'd and play'd, Nor at this tale did any man much grieve, Unless indeed 'twas Oswald, our good Reve. Because that he was of the carpenter craft, In his heart still a little ire is left. He 'gan to grudge it somewhat, as scarce right; âSo aid me!â quoth he; âI could such requite By throwing dust in a proud miller's eye, If that I chose to speak of ribaldry. But I am old; I cannot play for age; Grass-time is doneâmy fodder is now forÃ¡ge; This white top sadly writeth mine old years; Mine heart is also mouldy'd as mine hairs: And since I fare as doth the medlar tree, That fruit with time grows ever the worse to be, Till it be rotten in rubbish and in straw. âWe old men, as I fear, the same lot draw; Till we be rotten can we not be ripe. We ever hop while that the world will pipe; For in our will there sticketh ever a nail, To have a hoary head and a green tail, As hath a leek; for though our strength be lame, Our will desireth folly ever the same; For when our climbing's done, our words aspire; Still in our ashes old is reeking fire Or thus:â For when our climbing's done our speech aspires; E'en in our ashes live their wonted fires. The original lines are:â âFor whanne we may not don than wol we speken, Yet in our ashen olde is fyre yreken.â The coincidence of the last line with the one quoted from Gray's Elegy will be remarked. Mr. Tyrwhit says, he should certainly have considered the latter as an âimitationâ (of Chaucer), âif Mr. Gray himself had not referred us to the 169 (170) Sonnet of Petrarch, as his original:â Ch' i' veggio nel pensier, dolce mio foco, Fredda una lingua, e duo begli occhi chiusi Rimaner dopo noi pien' di faville. The sentiment is different in all three; but the form of expression, here adopted by Gray, closely resembles that of the Father of English Poetry; although, in Gray's time, it was no doubt far more elegant to quote Petrarch than Chaucer. âFour hot coals have we, which I will express: Boasting, lying, anger, and covetousness. These burning coals are common unto age, Our old limbs well may stumble o'er the stage, But will shall never fail us, that is sooth. Still in my head was always a colt's tooth, As many a year as now is pass'd and done, Since that my tap of life began to run. For certainly when I was born, I trow, Death drew the tap of life, and let it flow; And ever since the tap so fast hath run, That well-nigh empty now is all the tun. The stream of life but drips from time to time; The silly tongue may well ring out and chime Of wretchedness, that passÃ©d is of yore: With aged folk, save dotage, there's nought more.â When that our Host had heard this sermoning, He 'gan to speak as lordly as a king; And said, âWhy, what amounteth all this wit? What! shall we speak all day of holy writ? The devil can make a steward fit to preach, Or of a cobbler a sailor, or a leach. Say forth thy tale; and tarry not the time. Lo Deptford! and the hour is half way prime: Lo Greenwich!âthere where many a shrew loves sinâ It were high time thy story to begin.â âNow, fair sirs!â quoth this Oswald, the old Reve, âI pray you all that you yourselves ne'er grieve, Though my reply should somewhat fret his nose; For lawful 'tis with force, force to oppose. This drunken Miller hath informed us here How that some folks beguiled a carpenterâ Perhaps in scorn that I of yore was one. So, by your leave, him I'll requite anon. In his own churlish language will I speak, And pray to heaven besides, his neck may break. A small stalk in mine eye he sees, I deem, But in his own he cannot see a beam. THE REVE'S TALE. At Trumpington, near Cambridge, if you look, There goeth a bridge, and under that a brook, Upon which brook there stood a flour-mill; And this is a known fact that now I tell. A Miller there had dwelt for many a day; As any peacock he was proud and gay. He could pipe well, and fish, mend nets, to boot, Turn cups with a lathe, and wrestle well, and shoot. A Norman dirk, as brown as is a spade, Hung by his belt, and eke a trenchant blade. A jolly dagger bare he in his pouch: There was no man, for peril, durst him touch. A Sheffield clasp-knife lay within his hose. Round was his face, and broad and flat his nose. High and retreating was his bald ape's skull: He swagger'd when the market-place was full. There durst no wight a hand lift to resent it, But soon, this Miller swore, he should repent it. A thief he was, forsooth, of corn and meal, A sly one, too, and used long since to steal. Disdainful Simkin, was he called by name. A wife he had; of noble kin she came: The rector of the town her father was. With her he gave full many a pan of brass, That Simkin with his blood should thus ally. She had been brought up in a nunnery; For Simkin ne'er would have a wife, he said, Unless she were well tutor'd and a maid, To carry on his line of yeomanry: And she was proud and pert as is a pie. It was a pleasant thing to see these two: On holydays before her would he go, With his large tippet bound about his head; While she came after in a gown of red, And Simkin wore his long hose of the same. There durst no wight address her but as Dame: None was so bold that pass'd along the way, Who with her durst once toy or jesting play, Unless he wish'd the sudden loss of life Before Disdainful Simkin's sword or knife. (For jealous folk most fierce and perilous grow; And this they always wish their wives to know.) But since that to broad jokes she'd no dislike, She was as pure as water in a dyke, And with abuse all fill'd and froward air. She thought that ladies should her temper bear, Both for her kindred, and the lessons high That had been taught her in the nunnery. These two a fair and buxom daughter had, Of twenty years; no more since they were wed, Saving a child, that was but six months old; A little boy in cradle rocked and rolled. This daughter was a stout and well-grown lass, With broad flat nose, and eyes as grey as glass. Broad were her hips; her bosom round and high; But right fair was she hereâI will not lie. The rector of the town, as she was fair, A purpose had to make her his sole heir, Both of his cattle and his tenement; But only if she married as he meant. It was his purpose to bestow her high, Into some worthy blood of ancestry: For holy church's good must be expended On holy church's blood that is descended; Therefore he would his holy church honÃ³ur, Although that holy church he should devour. Great toll and fee had Simkin, out of doubt, With wheat and malt, of all the land about, And in especial was the Soler Hallâ A college great at Cambridge thus they callâ Which at this mill both wheat and malt had ground. And on a day it suddenly was found, Sick lay the Manciple of a malady; And men for certain thought that he must die. Whereon this Miller both of corn and meal An hundred times more than before did steal; For, ere this chance, he stole but courteously, But now he was a thief outrageously. The warden scolded with an angry air; But this the Miller rated not a tare: He sang high bass, and swore it was not so! There were two scholars young, and poor, I trow, That dwelt within the Hall of which I say. Headstrong they were and lusty for to play; And merely for their mirth and revelry, Out to the warden eagerly they cry, That he should let them, for a merry round, Go to the mill, and see their own corn ground, And each would fair and boldly lay his neck The Miller should not steal them half a peck Of corn by sleight, nor by main force bereave. And at the last the warden gave them leave: One was call'd John, and Allen named the other; From the same town they came, which was called Strauther, Far in the NorthâI cannot tell you where. This Allen maketh ready all his gear, And on a horse the sack he cast anon: Forth go these merry clerks, Allen and John, With good sword and with buckler by their side. John knew the way, and needed not a guide; And at the mill the sack adown he layeth. Allen spake first:ââSimon, all hail! in faith, How fares thy daughter, and thy worthy wife?â âAllen,â quoth Simkin, âwelcome, by my life; And also John:âhow now! what do ye here?â âSimon,â quoth John, âcompulsion has no peer. They who've nae lackeys must themselves bestir, Or else they are but fools, as clerks aver. Our Manciple I think will soon be dead, Sae slowly work the grinders in his head; And therefore am I come with Allen thus, To grind our corn, and carry it hame with us: I pray you speed us, that we may be gone.â Quoth Simkin, âBy my faith it shall be done; What will ye do, while that it is in hand?â âGude's life! right by the hopper will I stand,â (Quoth John,) âand see how that the corn goes in. I never yet saw, by my father's kin, How that the hopper waggles to and fro.â Allen continued,ââJohn, and wilt thou so? Then will I be beneath it, by my crown, And see how that the meal comes running down Into the troughâand that shall be my sport. For, John, like you, I'm of the curious sort; And quite as bad a millerâso let's see!â This Miller smiled at their 'cute nicety, And thought,âall this is done but for a wile; They fancy that no man can them beguile: But, by my thrift, I'll dust their searching eye, For all the sleights in their philosophy. The more quaint knacks and guarded plans they make, The more corn will I steal when once I take: Instead of flour, I'll leave them nought but bran: The greatest clerks are not the wisest men. As whilom to the wolf thus spake the mare: Of all their art I do not count a tare. Out at the door he goeth full privily, When that he saw his time, and noiselessly: He looketh up and down, till he hath found The clerks' bay horse, where he was standing bound Under an ivy wall, behind the mill: And to the horse he goeth him fair and well, And strippeth off the bridle in a trice. And when the horse was loose he 'gan to race Unto the wild mares wandering in the fen, With wehee! whinny! right through thick and thin! This Miller then return'd; no word he said, But doth his work, and with these clerks he play'd, Till that their corn was well and fairly ground. And when the meal is sack'd and safely bound, John goeth out, and found his horse was gone, And cried aloud with many a stamp and groan, âOur horse is lost! Allen, od's banes! I say, Up on thy feet!âcome off, manâup, away! Alas! our warden's palfrey, it is gone!â Allen at once forgot both meal and cornâ Out of his mind went all his husbandryâ âWhat!âwhilk way is he gone?â he 'gan to cry. The Miller's wife came laughing inwardly, âAlas!â said she, âyour horse iâ the fens doth fly After wild mares as fast as he can go! Ill luck betide the hand that bound him so, And his that better should have knit the rein.â âAlas!â quoth John, âgood Allen, haste amain; Lay down thy sword, as I will mine also; Heaven knoweth I am as nimble as a roe; He shall not 'scape us baith, or my saul's dead! Why didst not put the horse within the shed? By the mass, Allen, thou'rt a fool, I say!â Those silly clerks have scamper'd fast away Unto the fen; Allen and nimble John: And when the Miller saw that they were gone, He half a bushel of their flour doth take, And bade his wife go knead it in a cake. He said, âI trow these clerks fear'd what they've found; Yet can a miller turn a scholar round For all his art. Yea, let them go their way! See where they run! yea, let the children play: They get him not so lightly, by my crown.â The simple clerks go running up and down, With âSoft, soft!âstand, stand!âhither!âback!âtake care!â Now whistle thou, and I shall keep him here!â But, to be brief, until the very night They could not, though they tried with all their might, The palfrey catch; he always ran so fast: Till in a ditch they caught him at the last. Weary and wet as beasts amid the rain, Allen and John come slowly back again. âAlas,â quoth John, âthat ever I was born! Now are we turn'd into contempt and scorn. Our corn is stolen; fools they will us call; The warden, and our college fellows all, And 'specially the Millerâ'las the day!â Thus plaineth John while going by the way Toward the mill, the bay nag in his hand. The Miller sitting by the fire they found, For it was night: no further could they move; But they besought him, for heaven's holy love, Lodgment and food to give them for their penny. And Simkin answered, âIf that there be any, Such as it is, yet shall ye have your part. My house is small, but ye have learnÃ©d art; Ye can, by arguments, well make a place A mile broad, out of twenty foot of space! Let's see now if this place, as 'tis, suffice; Or, make more room with speech, as is your guise.â âNow, Simon, by Saint Cuthbert,â said this John, âThou'rt ever merry, and that's answer'd soon. I've heard that man must needs choose o' twa things; Such as he finds, or else such as he brings. But specially I pray thee, mine host dear, Let us have meat and drink, and make us cheer, And we shall pay you to the full, be sure: With empty hand men may na' hawks allure. Lo! here's our siller ready to be spent!â The Miller to the town his daughter sent For ale and bread, and roasted them a goose; And bound their horse; he should no more get loose; And in his own room made for them a bed, With blankets, sheets, and coverlet well spread: Not twelve feet from his own bed did it stand. His daughter, by herself, as it was plann'd, In a small passage closet, slept close by: It might no better be, for reasons why,â There was no wider chamber in the place. They sup, and jest, and show a merry face, And drink of ale, the strongest and the best. It was just midnight when they went to rest. Well hath this Simkin varnish'd his hot head; Full pale he was with drinking, and nought red. He hiccougheth, and speaketh through the nose, As with the worst of colds, or quinsy's throes. To bed he goeth, and with him trips his wife; Light as a jay, and jolly seem'd her life, So was her jolly whistle well ywet. The cradle at her bed's foot close she set To rock, or nurse the infant in the night. And when the jug of ale was emptied quite, To bed, likewise, the daughter went anon: To bed goes Allen; with him also John. All's said: they need no drugs from poppies pale. This Miller hath so wisely bibbed of ale, But as an horse he snorteth in his sleep, And blurteth secrets which awake he'd keep. His wife a burden bare him, and full strong: Men might their routing hear a good furlong. The daughter routeth eke, par compagnie. Allen, the clerk, that heard this melody, Now poketh John, and said, âWhy sleepest thou? Heardest thou ever sic a song e'er now? Lo, what a serenade's among them all! A wild-fire red upon their bodies fall! Wha ever listened to sae strange a thing? The flower of evil shall their ending bring. This whole night there to me betides no rest. But, courage yet, all shall be for the best; For, John,â said he, âas I may ever thrive, To pipe a merrier serenade I'll strive In the dark passage somewhere near to us; For, John, there is a law which sayeth thus,â That if a man in one point be aggrieved, Right in another he shall be relieved: Our corn is stolenâsad yet sooth to sayâ And we have had an evil bout to-day; But since the Miller no amends will make, Against our loss we should some payment take. His sonsie daughter will I seek to win, And get our meal backâdeil reward his sin! By hallow-mass it shall no otherwise be!â But John replied, âAllen, well counsel thee: The miller is a perilous man,â he said, âAnd if he wake and start up from his bed, He may do both of us a villany.â âNay,â Allen said, âI count him not a flie!â And up he rose, and crept along the floor Into the passage humming with their snore: As narrow was it as a drum or tub. And like a beetle doth he grope and grub, Feeling his way with darkness in his hands, Till at the passage end he stooping stands. John lieth still, and not far off, I trow, And to himself he maketh ruth and woe. âAlas,â quoth he, âthis is a wicked jape! Now may I say that I am but an ape. Allen may somewhat quit him for his wrong: Already can I hear his plaint and song; So shall his 'venture happily be sped, While like a rubbish-sack I lie in bed; And when this jape is told another day, I shall be call'd a fool, or a cokenÃ¡y! I will adventure somewhat, too, in faith: âWeak heart, worse fortune,â as the proverb saith.â And up he rose at once, and softly went Unto the cradle, as 'twas his intent, And to his bed's foot bare it, with the brat. The wife her routing ceased soon after that, And woke, and left her bed; for she was pained With night-mare dreams of skies that madly rained. Eastern astrologers and clerks, I wis, In time of Apis tell of storms like this. A while she stayed, and waxeth calm in mind; Returning then, no cradle doth she find, And gropeth here and thereâbut she found none. âAlas,â quoth she, âI had almost misgone! I well-nigh stumbled on the clerks a-bed: Eh benedicite! but I am safely sped. And on she went, till she the cradle found, While through the dark still groping with her hand. Meantime was heard the beating of a wing, And then the third cock of the morn 'gan sing. Allen stole back, and thought âere that it dawn I will creep in by John that lieth forlorn.â He found the cradle in his hand, anon. âGude Lord!â thought Allen, âall wrong have I gone! My head is dizzy with the ale last night, And eke my piping, that I go not right. Wrong am I, by the cradle well I know: Here lieth Simkin, and his wife alsÃ³.â And, scrambling forthright on, he made his way Unto the bed where Simkin snoring lay! He thought to nestle by his fellow John, And by the Miller in he crept, anon, And caught him by the neck, and 'gan to shake, And said, âThou John! thou swine's head dull, awake! Wake, by the mass! and hear a noble game, For, by St. Andrew! to thy ruth and shame, I have been trolling roundelays this night, And won the Miller's daughter's heart outright, Who hath me told where hidden is our meal: All thisâand moreâand how they always steal; While thou hast as a coward lain aghast!â âThou slanderous ribald!â quoth the Miller, âhast? A traitor false, false lying clerk!â quoth he, âThou shalt be slain by heaven's dignity, Who rudely dar'st disparage with foul lie My daughter that is come of lineage high!â And by the throat he Allen grasp'd amain; And caught him, yet more furiously, again, And on his nose he smote him with his fist! Down ran the bloody stream upon his breast, And on the floor they tumble, heel and crown, And shake the houseâit seem'd all coming down. And up they rise, and down again they roll; Till that the Miller, stumbling o'er a coal, Went plunging headlong like a bull at bait, And met his wife, and both fell flat as slate. âHelp, holy cross of Bromeholm!â loud she cried, âAnd, all ye martyrs, fight upon my side! In manus tuasâhelp!âon thee I call! Simon, awake! the fiend on me doth fall: He crusheth meâhelp!âI am well-nigh dead; He lieth along my heart, and heels, and head. Help, Simkin! for the false clerks rage and fight!â Now sprang up John as fast as ever he might, And graspeth by the dark walls to and fro To find a staff: the wife starts up also. She knew the place far better than this John, And by the wall she caught a staff anon. She saw a little shimmering of a light, For at an hole in shone the moon all bright, And by that gleam she saw the struggling two, But knew not, as for certain, who was who, Save that she saw a white thing in her eye. And when that she this white thing 'gan espy, She thought that Allen did a night-cap wear, And with the staff she drew near, and more near, And, thinking 'twas the clerk, she smote at full Disdainful Simkin on his bald ape's skull. Down goes the Miller, crying âHarow, I die!â These clerks they beat him well, and let him lie. They make them ready, and take their horse anon, And eke their meal, and on their way are gone; And from behind the mill-door took their cake, Of half a bushel of flourâa right good bake.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE FRANKLIN'S TALE; MODERNIZED By R. H. HORNE. THE FRANKLIN'S PROLOGUE. âSquire, in good faith, thou hast thyself well quit, And fair and well I praise thy gentle wit,â The Franklin said; âconsidering thy youth, So feelingly thou speak'st, Sir, in good sooth, If I may say so, there is no one here That shall with thee in eloquence compare If that thou live; God give to thee good chance, And to thy virtue send continuance. Thy speaking pleaseth me in great degree. I have a son, and by the sacred Three, Rather than twenty poundsâ worth of fair land, I would, though now 'twere fallen in my hand, He were a man of such discretion high As I find thee: fie on possessions, fie! Unless a man be virtuous withal. I have my son reprov'd, and often shall: To virtuous counsel will he not attend, But loves to play at dice, and to expend, And to lose all he hathâa gambling rage; And he would rather talk with groom or page Than converse hold with any gentle wight Of whom he gentilesse might learn aright.â âStraw for your gentilesse!â exclaimed our Host: What, Franklin! pardie, Sir, full well thou know'st That each of you, as we have made accord, Must tell a tale or two, or break his word.â âSir,â quoth the Franklin, âyou say well and plain: I pray you have me not in such disdain, Though I to this man speak a word or two.â âTell,â quoth the Host, âthy tale: why this to-do?â âGladly, Sir Host,â quoth he, âI will obey Your pleasant will: now hearken what I say;â I shall your purpose hinder in no wise, So far as my poor knowledge may suffice. I pray to God that it may please you well, Then will be good enough the tale I tell.â âThese Britons old, and noble in their days, Of strange adventures made them divers lays, Rhymed in their earliest native British tongue; Which lays unto their instruments they sung, Or else they read them for their cordial glee: And one of them have I in memory. I'll tell it with good will, as best I can.â âBut, Sirs, because I am a rough-spun man, Ere my beginning I would you beseech Have me excused for my unstudied speech. Rhetoric I never learnt, and none will feign: All that I speak it must be bare and plain. Dreams on Parnassus Mount I ne'er did know, Nor studied Marcus Tullius Cicero. Figures and colours know I none, indeed, But such as grow for ever in the mead; Or else such hues as men dye with, or paint;â Colours of rhetoric are to me all quaint: My spirit feeleth nought of such dry cheer; But if ye list my story ye shall hear.â THE FRANKLIN'S TALE. In Armorique, once known as Basse Bretaigne, There was a knight who sought with loving pain A lady, and to serve her in best guise; And many a labour, many a great emprise, He for this lady wrought e'er she was won. One of the fairest was she 'neath the sun, And thereto in her lineage so high That scarcely durst this lover tremblingly Tell her his woe, his passion, and distress. But, at the last, she, for his worthiness, And chiefly for his meek obedience sweet, Caught pity from his penance at her feet, Till secretly she fell into accord, To take him for her husband and her lord,â (Such lordship as men have over their wives). And in more bliss to lead their future lives, Of his free will his knightly word he pass'd, Never, by night or day, while life should last, To claim or take upon him mastery Over her will, nor vex with jealousy; But her obey, and follow her will in all, As any lover at his lady's call: Save that the name or shadow of sovereignty, Still would he keep for shame of his degree. She thankÃ©d him, and with great humbleness She answer'd, âSir, since of your gentleness Ye proffer me to have so large a reign, I pray to God that ne'er between us twain, Far less through guilt of mine, be war or strife. Sir, I will be your humble and true wife. Take here my heart, till that it leave my breast.â Thus are they both in quiet and at rest. For one thing, Sirs, full safely dare I say,â That loving friends each other must obey, If they would long remain in company. Love will not be constrain'd by mastery. When mastery cometh, the God of Love anon Beateth his wingsâand, farewell! he is gone Butler has made a very excellent paraphrase of this passage in his Hudibras, part iii. c. l. lines 553 to 560. Pope has made use of Chaucer more literally. âLove, free as air, at sight of human ties, Spreads his light wings, and in a moment flies.â Eloise to Abelard. Warburton, in a note on these lines, alludes to this âimitationâ of Chaucer, and quotes the following as being the original:â When maisterie comes, the Lord of Love anon Flutters his wings, and forthwith is he gone. The words in italics are Warburton's. Neither of these versions possess any of the vigour and sincerity of the Father of English Poetry. The light perfumed wings, admirably adapted to the idealities of the boudoir, with all their fluttering levity, have none of the moral justification of an honest passion.. Love is a thing as any spirit free: Women, by nature, wish for liberty, And not to be constrain'd as in a thrall; And so do men, to speak truth,âone and all. Note well the wight most patient in his love: He standeth, in advantage, all above. That patience is a virtue high, is plain, Because it conquers, as the clerks explain, Things that rude vigour never could attain. Chide not for every trifle, nor complain; Learn to endure, or, so betide my lot, Learn it ye shall, whether ye will or not. For in this world is no one, certain 'tis, But that he sometimes doth, or saith, amiss. Anger, ill health, or influence malign Of planetsâchanges in the bloodâwoe, wine, Oft cause in word or deed that we transgress. For every wrong we should not seek redress. After a time there must be temperance In every man that knows self-governance. And therefore hath this worthy and wise knight (To live in ease) yielded his wife all right; And she to him as wisely 'gan to swear That never should there be default in her. Here may men see an humble wise accord. Thus taketh she her servant and her lord: Servant in love, in marriage lord to be. Lordship and servitude at once hath he? Servitude?ânay, in lordship all above, Since that he hath his lady and his love: His lady doubtless, but his wife besides, In all that love by its own law decides. And when he prosperous was in this degree, Home with his wife he went to his countrÃ©y: Not far from Penmark was his pleasant seat, And there he liveth in bliss and solace sweet. Who could declare, save those that wedded be, The joy, the ease, and the prosperity, That is between an husband and his wife? A year and more lasteth this blissful life, Till that this knightâby name Arviragus, Of Cairrud, and whose tale I tell you thusâ Resolved to go and dwell a year or twain In England, that was also call'd Britain; Worship and honour to achieve in arms, (For him such labour had the noblest charms) And there he staid two years: the book saith thus. Now will I leave this knight Arviragus, And speak awhile of Dorigen his wife, Who loveth her husband as her heart's best life. Grief at his absence sighs and weeping prove, As with these noble wives bereaved of love. She mourneth, waketh, waileth, fasteth, plaineth; The yearning for his presence so constraineth, That all this widened world she set at nought. Her dearest friends who knew her heavy thought, Comfort her pain in all that ever they may: They preach to her; they tell her night and day That without cause her life she wastes, alas! And every comfort possible in this case, With busy care they give, and round her press, In hopes to make her leave this heaviness. Progressively, as know ye every one, Men may engrave so long upon a stone That there some figure shall imprinted be; So long her friends have wrought on her, that she, By hope and reason hath resumed her station, Receiving impress of their consolation, Which somewhat doth her sorrow great assuage: She could not live in its unceasing rage. Arviragus also, with his utmost care, Hath sent her letters home of his welfÃ¡re, And that he shortly should come back again; Or else with sorrow had her heart been slain. Her friends perceived her sorrow 'gan to slake, And prayed her on their knees, for Jesu's sake, To come and journey in their company, And thereby banish her dark phantasy: And finally she granted that request, For well she saw that it was for the best. Now stood their castle fast by the wild sea, And often with her friends forth walkÃ©d she, Pastime to take along the bank on high, Where she could many a ship and barge espie, Sailing their course, where'er they list to go. But this became a part, then, of her woe, For to herself full oft, âAlas!â said she, âIs there not one, oâ the many ships I see, Will bring me home my lord?âthen were my heart Heal'd and reliev'd of pain and bitter smart.â At other times there would she sit and think; And cast her sad eyes downward from the brink, And when she saw the grisly rock-rifts black, For very terror would her heart so shake That she could not sustain herself, I ween. Then would she sit adown upon the green, And piteously the sea beneath behold, And say right thus, with sighs care-full and cold: âEternal God! that through thy Providence Guidest this world by certain governance,â In vain, as men say, dost thou nothing make: But oh, Dread Lord, these grisly fiend-rocks black, That rather seem of work a foul confusion, Than any fair creation or conclusion Of such a perfect God, all-wise and stable;â Why hast thou wrought this work unreasonable? For by this work,ânorth, south, nor east, nor west, Is fed or foster'd man, or bird, or beast: It doth no good, methinks, but all annoyeth. See ye not, Lord, mankind how it destroyeth? An hundred thousand bodies of mankind Have rocks slainâthough we bear it not in mind; Yet man is of thy work so fair a part, Thou madest him in thine image, as thou art. Thus doth it seem ye had great charity Towards mankind; but how then may it be That ye a means have taken which destroyeth; Which means effects no good, but ever annoyeth? âI wot well, clerks will say e'en as they list, By arguments, that all is for the best, Though I can of the causes nought yknow: But thou, Great God, that made the wind to blow, Keep safe my lord!âsuch my conclusion is: To clerks leave I all vain disputes like this But would to heaven that all these fiend-rocks black Were sunk down into hell, for his dear sake! These rocks they tear my heart with constant fear.ââ Thus would she speak with many a piteous tear. Her friends now saw it was no pleasantness To ramble by the sea, but wretchedness; And sought amusement elsewhere. Through fair dells They lead her by the rivers, lakes, and wells, And other places full of lovelyness: They dance, and play at games of drafts and chess. So on a day, right in the morning tide, Unto a garden that was close beside, In which they pleasantly had ranged about Their tents and seats, and all the feast set out; There went they forth to sport them all the day. This the sixth morning was of fragrant May; Which May all painted had with his soft showers This garden full of leaves and eke of flowers, And curiously the hand of man with art Had deck'd this garden truly in each part, That never was there garden of such price, Except it were the very Paradise. The odour of flowers and freshness of the sight Would any heart have filled and made it light, That e'er was bornâsickness too great, unless, Or too great sorrow, held it in distressâ So full it was of beauty and pleasÃ¡nce. And after dinner went they forth to dance, And sing also, save Dorigen alone, Who her complaint made always, and her moan, For him she saw not through the dances go, Who was her husband and her lover too. But ne'ertheless she must a time abide, And through good hopes let her pale sorrow glide. Amid this dance, above all other men, DancÃ©d a squire before this Dorigen, That fresher was and brighter of array, As to my mind, than is the month of May. He singeth, danceth, passing any man, That is or was since that the world began. Therewith he was, should I to paint him strive, One of the best conditioned men alive: Young, strong, and virtuous, and rich, and wise, And well beloved, and holden in great prize; And, briefly, if the truth I must recall, While Dorigen unconscious was of all, This lusty squireâvotary of Beauty's Queen, And named Aureliusâsince he had her seen, Of any creature her had loved the best, Two years and more; such was his fate's behest. But of his grievance durst he never tell: Unmeasurably drank he from his well. He was despairing; nothing would he say; Save in his songs he somewhat would betray His grief, in general bitterness of thought: He said he loved, and was belovÃ©d nought. Of such sad matter made he many lays; Songs, and complaints, roundels, and virelays: How that he durst not of his sorrow tell, But languisheth, as doth a fury in hell; And die he must, as Echo did, said he, For sweet Narcissusâloving silently. In other manner than ye hear me say, To Dorigen he dare not aught betray, Save that perhaps at dances, here and there, When that young folk are free and debonaire, It may well be he looked upon her face In such a guise as man that asketh grace: But nothing wist she of his fond intent. But ne'ertheless it happ'd as thence they wentâ Because he was her neighbour, dwelling near; A man of worship and of honour fair; And Dorigen had known him well of yoreâ They fell in converse; and aye more and more Unto his purpose drew Aurelius: And when he saw his time, he said right thus. âMadam,â quoth he, âby Him who this world made, So that I wist it might your gladness aid, I would, that day when your Arviragus Went over sea, that I, Aurelius, Had gone, whence I should never come again. For well I wot my service is in vain:â My guerdon is but breaking of my heart. Madam! have ruth upon me ere we part; For with a word ye may me kill or save. Here, at your feet, would God I had my grave! Enough time now I have not more to say: Have mercy, sweet, or else ye will me slay.â She 'gan to look upon Aurelius now: âIs this your will,â quoth she, âand say ye so? Never, ere this, I dreamt of what ye meant; But now I know, Aurelius, your intent, By yonder Power that gave me soul and life, Never will I be found an untrue wife In word nor work, as far as I have wit: I will be his to whom that I am knit. Take this for final answer now from me.ââ But smiling, after that, continued she: âAurelius,â said she, âby high God above, Yet will I grant that you shall have your love (Thus hearing you so piteously complain;) Lo! on the day that lengthways through Bretaigne Ye all the rocks remove, stone after stone, That boat or ship strike not again thereon: I say, when ye have made the coast so clean Of rocks, that not a single stone is seen, Then will I love you best of any man! Take here my troth for all that ever I can. Full well I wot that it shall never betide: Let all such folly out of your heart glide. Why should a man's life waste in fancies weak, That he another's wife should love and seek, Who giveth her husband all things evermore?â Now, and full oft, Aurelius sigheth sore. âIs there no other grace in you?â quoth he: âNo, by that Lord,â she said, âthat makÃ©d me.â Woe was Aurelius when these words she spoke, And with a sorrowful heart he silence broke: âMadam, this is impossible!â said he: âA sudden, horrid death, mine end must be.â And with that word he turned him pale away. Then came her other friends, in pleasant way, And in the alleys roam'd they up and down, Nor of this matter aught to them was known, But suddenly their revels they renew, Till that the bright faced sun had lost his hue; Because the horizon 'reft him of his light (This is to say, in other words, 'twas night) And home all wend in ease, and full of glee, Save wretched Aureliusânone was sad but he. He to his house is gone with sorrowful heart. He saith he cannot 'scape of death the dart: It seemed to him he felt his heart a-cold. Up to the heavens his hands he 'gan to hold And on his bare knees forthwith sank he down, And in his raving said his orison. For very woe out of his wits he strayed: He knew not what he spake, but thus he said: With piteous heart his plaint hath he begun Unto the gods; and first unto the sun. He said, âApollo! God, and ruling power Of every plant, and herb, and tree, and flower; That giv'st, according to thy declination, To each his time, his season, and his station, E'en as thy bright house changeth low and high; Lord PhÅbus, cast thine ever-pitying eye On wretched Aureliusânow a man forlorn! Behold, my lady hath my death-blow sworn, Though guiltless I:âbut thou, Benignity, Some pity for my deadly heart give me! For well I wot, Lord PhÅbus, if ye list, Ye may me helpâexcept my ladyâbest. Now vouchsafe, God, that I may you apprise How that I may be helped, and in what wise. âYour blissful sister Luna, silvery sheen, That of the sea chief goddess is and queenâ Though Neptune have his god-ship in the sea, Yet clouded empress over him is sheâ Ye well know, Lord, that even as her desire Is to be quicken'dâlighted by your fire, For which she followeth like an humble creature; Right so, the sea desireth by its nature To follow her, as she is goddess high Both of the sea and rivers far and nigh. Wherefore, Lord PhÅbus, pity on me take! Work thou this miracle, or mine heart break;â That when in opposition next shall be Her orb, which in the Lion we shall see, Beseech her then so great a flood to bring, That fathoms five, at least, it overspring The highest rock in Armorique Bretaigne! And let this swollen flood endure years twain. Then, certes, to my lady may I say Hold your behestâthe rocks are all away! Lord PhÅbus, do this miracle for me;â Pray her to go no faster course than ye. I say thisâpray your sister that she go No faster course than ye, during years two. Then shall her visage be at full alwÃ¡y, And thus the spring-flood last both night and day. But if that my complaint she will not hear, And grant to me my sovran lady dear, Then pray her every rock to sink adown Into the region dark, which is her own, Under the ground, where Pluto dwells in night; Or never shall I win my lady bright. âThy temple in Delphos will I barefoot seek. Lord PhÅbus, see the tears upon my cheek; And some compassion have upon my moan!â And with that word in sorrow he fell adown. Outstretch'd, and cold, in trance he lay full long. His brother, knowing of his passion strong, Upraised him, and to bed he hath him brought. Despairing in this torment and this thought, Leave I this woful creature thus to lie: I know not whether he will live or die. Arviragus with health and honour's dower, As one that was of chivalry the flower, At home arrives with other worthy men. Oh, blissful art thou now, thou Dorigen! Thou hast thy noble husband in thine arms; The fresh knight, safe from wars, and rocks, and storms, Who loveth thee, e'en as his own heart's life. Nothing suspicious was he of his wife, That any wight had access to her sought, And spoke of love: he had of that no thought; Nor listened he to any such affair. He danceth, jousteth, maketh merry cheer. And thus in joy and bliss I let them dwell, And of the sick Aurelius will I tell. In languor and in torment furious, Two years and more lay worn Aurelius, Ere that one foot of earth his step hath gone; And comfort all this season had he none, Save from his brother, who was a wise clerk, And knew of all this woe and all this work. For to no other creature, certain 'tis, He durst confide a single word of this. More close in heart he hid the fond idea, Than Pamphilus did, when loving Galatea. His breast was whole without, and nought was seen, But in his heart aye was the arrow keen; And well ye know a wound with skin healed o'er, In surgery is perilous evermore, Unless the arrow touched or drawn may be. His brother weepeth and waileth privately, Till he bethought him at the last, by chance, That while he was at Orleans, in France,â (Among young clerks that have a hankering To study arts, and each forbidden thing, Prying in every nook at every turn, Particular sciences to seek and learn,)â If memory truly served, upon a day A curious book, which in the study lay, Of natural magic, on the desk he saw, Left by his friend; a bachelor of law At that timeâall unwitting on his part, For he was there to learn a different art. This book of mansions spake, and operations Touching the eight and twenty mystic stations That to the moon belongâsuch folly high As in our own days is not worth a fly: For holy church's faith, as we believe, Never illusion suffereth us to grieve. When he bethought him of this book in France, Anon his heart for joy began to dance, And to himself he said right secretlyâ âMy brother soon recovered now shall be; For I am sure that sciences there are By which men divers visions make appear; Such tricks as subtle jugglers ever play. Full oft, at feasting times, have I heard say That jugglers, standing in a knight's hall large, Have made come in a river and a barge, And through the hall go rowing up and down. Sometimes a lion grim himself hath shewn; And sometimes flowers sprung up as in a mead; Sometimes a vine, with ripe grapes white and red; Sometimes a castle, all of lime and stone;â And when they wishedâ'twas voided, and all gone! Thus seemeth it, at least, to all men's sight. âNow then conclude I thus,âif that I might Some old magician still at Orleans find, Who hath the moon's quaint mansions in his mind, Or other magic sleights with stars above, Through him my brother may obtain his love; For by illusion can these old clerks make Unto man's sight that all the buge rocks black Of Bretaigne, were evanished every one, While ships come close to land, and then float on: And thus continue for a day or two. Then were my brother cured of all his woe. For then must Dorigen her promise hold, Or else, at least, her shameful jest be told.â Why should I make a longer tale of this? Unto his brother's bed he came, I wis, And gave him such good reason to begone For Orleans, that he started up anon, And on his way forth-forward doth he fare, In hopes to be reliev'd of all his care. When that the city they can well nigh see, Not distant more than furlongs two or three, A young clerk roaming by himself they meet, Who cautiously in Latin doth them greet; And after that he said a wondrous thing:â âI know,â quoth he, âthe object that doth bring You here!â and scarce a foot they further went Before he told them what was their intent. Aurelius' brother asked him anxiously Of jugglers, known to him in days gone by; And he replied, that dead these old clerks were, For which he wept full often many a tear. Down from his horse Aurelius 'lights anon, And with this young magician is he gone Home to his house. He made them well at ease: There lack'd no viands to recruit and please. A house so well conducted as this one, Aurelius in his life saw never, none. He show'd them, ere they went to supper here, Forests, and green parks full of the wild deer: There saw Aurelius harts with antlers high; The greatest that were ever seen with eye. He saw, of them, an hundred slain by hounds, And some from arrows bled with bitter wounds. He saw, when swept away the herds of deer, The falconers rowing on a river clear, Who with their falcons have the heron slain. Then saw he gay knights tilting in a plain; And after this, his fond heart to entrance, He show'd to him his lady in a dance, In which himself danced also,âas he thought;â And when the Master, who this magic wrought, Saw fit, he clapp'd his hands at this false clothing,â And farewell all the revel! There is nothing! And yet removed they never out o' the house While all these sights they saw, so marvellous, But in his study, where his books all be, There sat they stillâand no wight but these three! To him this Master call'd his servant now, And said right thus, âTo supper may we go? Almost an hour it is, I undertake, Since that I bade you should our supper make, When these my worthy friends both went with me Into my study, where my books all be.â âSir,â quoth the servant, âwhen it liketh you: It is all ready, if ye choose, right now.â âCome, then, we'll sup,â said he, âfor, with the best, These amorous folk must sometimes take their rest.â After their supper, treaty make these three What good sum should this Master's guerdon be, If he removed the black rocks of Bretaigne, And eke from Gironde to the mouth of Seine. He made it a great favourââGod him save, Less than a thousand pound he would not have; Nor, e'en for that sum, cared he to be gone!â Aurelius with a blissful heart, anon Answer'd right thusââFie on a thousand pound! This world below, which scholars say is round, All would I give, if I were lord of it. This bargain is concludedâwe are knit: Ye shall be paid all truly, by my troth. But, look ye, for no negligence or sloth Delay us longer than to-morrow here.â âNay,â quoth the clerk, âgood faith to you I swear.â To bed is gone Aurelius, as he list, And well nigh all that night he had his rest: Faint with his labours, fed with hope of bliss, His woeful heart found some reprieve, I wis. Upon the morrow, when that it was day, To Bretaigne forthright sped they on their way;â Aureliusâthe magician at his side;â And are alighted where they will abide. Now this was, as my tables me remember, The cold and frosty season of December. PhÅbus wax'd old; like tarnish'd brass in hue; That, his hot declination passing through, Shone like to burnÃ©d gold, with broad rays bright; But now in Capricorn he down doth 'light, Wherein he shone full paleâI dare well say. The bitter frosts, with sleet and rain, affray The garden's green, till all hath disappeared. Janus sits by the fire with double beard, And drinketh from his buffalo-horn the wine! Before him stands brawn of the tuskÃ©d swine, And âChristmas!â crieth every lusty man. Aurelius now, in all that ever he can, Giveth his Master cheer and reverence, And prayeth him to work with diligence, And bring him out of anguish by his art, Or with a sword to thrust him through the heart. The subtle clerk such ruth hath on this man, That night and day he speedeth all he can, Watching the time that favour'd his conclusion; That is to say, the time for his illusion, So to make things appear by jugglery, (I know no terms of their astrology,) That Dorigen and every wight should say The solid rocks of Bretaigne were away, Or else they all were sunken under ground! So, at the last, he hath his fit time found To make the dark sleights and the wretchedness Of such a soul-deluding cursedness. His Tolitanian Tables forth he brought This astrological incantation stands thus in the original:â His tables Toletanes forth he brought Ful well corrected, that ther lacked nought, Nother his collect, ne his expans yeres, Nother his notes, ne his other geres, As ben his centres, and his argumentes, And his proportionel convenientes For his equations in every thing. And by his eighte speres in his werking, He knew ful wel how fer Alnath was shove Fro the hed of thilke fix Aries above That in the ninthe spere considered is, &amp;c. While the poet was writing this, nearly five hundred years ago, there was evidently a tendency to denounce the abuse of astrology. For the benefit of the curious, and to display the alleged advances of Science over Imagination, (to the destruction of the latter, as some affirm,) we have consulted a wellknown living astrologer on the above passage, who has obliged us with the following. âIn the time of Chaucer, the knowledge of the particular degrees, of each sign, occupying the cusp, or entrance, of the twelve horoscopal Houses, was extremely incorrect. The old tables have been abandoned by modern astrologers, (among whom there are several secret students in the universities of Oxford and Cambridge,) and are of course replaced by perfect tables. The extent of the error may be seen by the computations of Lilly, the celebrated astrologer of king Charles the First's time, (who received a grant of a hundred pounds a year from the Parliament,) and yet these Lilly tables are now published without correction, though corrected copies may be purchased cheaply. The errors ascribed to the science are in truth the errors of calculation. As for the mode of working adopted by the âclerkâ in this poem, we know that the moon rules in Cancerâthere she has her mansion and her dignitiesâand Cancer represents the ocean in the world's horoscope. If the poet has a latent and secondary meaning, then Cancer, in the Mysteries, is also the populace, and Neptune is public opinion. So far we may follow the âclerk,â but he subsequently shows himself to be a juggler, and not a worker by regular natural science. He meddles with fixed substances, instead of keeping to calculations and abstract ordinances. For nonentities (in the modern advances of science) have as much power as real things. What is the meridian but a nonentity? Yet the meridian changes the signification of all planetary bodies. Of the Tolitanian Tables, constructed by order of Alphonso, king of Naples, it does not appear that Chaucer knew much, nor are they valuable for correctness. But when the learned commentator on Chaucer, Mr. Tyrwhitt, undertakes to prove that the poet, in the opening of his great Prologue, was wrong in saying, âthe yonge sonne hath in the Ram his half cours yronne;â and that he ought to have said the Bull,â the poet turns out to be the best astronomer. For the poet reckoned by the new style, and not the old. The new style was not adopted at that time in England, but Chaucer took it in advance of his time from foreign tables. It was called a ânew styleâ only when adopted in Englandâbut it was not new to Chaucer. He means the first week of April.â Chaucer was evidently fond of astronomy, and wrote a treatise on the Astrolabe. A manuscript copy of this, together with a work on Geomancy, by another author, is now in the possession of the Duke of Northumberland; and a manuscript copy of the latter is also possessed by Mr. Varley, by whom we have been obliged with the foregoing unique comments. Full well corrected, and they lackÃ©d nought;â Neither his years, in compound sums, nor single, That in the heavenly computations mingle, Accordant with their motions and their phases; Neither his roots, wherefrom with care he raises His branching calculations; nor the intents Of all his centres and his arguments, (Their arcs described, proportional to find, Another are drawn somewhere in his mind) For his equations; right in every thing. And by his eight spheres, doth his working bring The proof how far the house of Alnath lay From the fix'd Aries' head i'the higher way; Which, hence, in the ninth sphere consider'd is. Full subtly calculated he all this. And when that his first mansion he obtain'd, He, by proportion, knew all that remain'd; And knew the rising of the moon right wellâ In whose faceâin what termâall could he tell; And likewise the moon's mansion knew, her station Accordant with his varying operation: And other observations he enhances For such illusions, and against mischances, As heathen folk would use in those old days. And now no longer maketh he delaysâ But through his magic, wrought in the night air, It seem'd the rocks were goneâor never there! Aurelius, both in hope and in despair, Unknowing how his chance of love may fare, Awaiteth for the prodigy night and day: And when he heard the rocks were all awayâ For a time vanish'dâall his barriers goneâ Down at his Master's feet he fell anon, And said, âI woeful wretch, Aurelius, Thank you, my Lord, and Venus fair, who thus Have helpÃ©d me out of my anguish cold.â And to the temple he his way doth hold, Wherein he knew his lady he should see. And when he saw his time, he tremblingly With heart in dread, and with full humble cheer, Saluted hath his sovran lady dear. âMy truth-full lady,â said this woeful man, âWhom I most dread, and love, as best I can, And last of all this world would I displease; Were't not that I for you upon my knees Must die here at your foot, and that anon, Nought would I tell how I am woe-begone. But, certes, either must I die or 'plaine: Ye slay me, guiltless, for my very pain. But for my death, though that ye have no ruth, Advise you well, ere that you break your troth: Pause, and repent unto the God above, Ere you destroy my life because I love. For, madam, call to mind what ye did plightâ Not that I challenge anything of right, From you, my sovran lady, but of grace; Howbeit, in a garden near yon place, Ye wot right well all that ye promised me; And in my hand your truth pledged willingly, To love me bestâGod wot, but ye said soâ Although that I unworthy am thereto. Madam, I speak it for your honour, more Than my heart's life to save, now wounded sore: All have I done that ye commanded me; And, if ye vouchsafe, ye may go and see. Do as ye listâbut bear your word in mind, For quick or dead, you shall me surely find; With you it lieth to give me life, or slayâ But well I wot the rocks are all away!â He taketh his leaveâand she astounded stood! In all her face was not one drop of blood! She thought not to be caught in such a trap. âAlas,â cried she, âthat ever this should hap! For dreamt I never by possibility That such a prodigy could ever be. It is against the order'd course of nature.â And home she slowly went, a sorrowful creature. For very fear all trembling doth she go. She weepeth, waileth constantly, days two, And swooneth often, pity 'twas to see; But what the occasion, to no wight told she, For, from the town Arviragus was gone. But to herself she spake thus, all forlorn, With a pale face, and with full sorry cheer In her complaint, as ye shall pitying hear. âAlas,â cried she, âFortune, on thee I 'plaine, Who, unaware, hast wrapped me in thy chain, From which to 'scape no succour can I see, Save but to die, or else dishonour'd be. One of these two behoveth me to choose; But ne'ertheless far rather would I lose My life, than give my nature up to shame, Or know myself all false, or blot my name: So shall my death absolve me from my vow. Hath there not many a noble wife, ere now And many a maiden, slain herself, alas! Rather than let dishonour o'er her pass. Yes, truly: lo! their stories witness bear. Why then of death should I have any fear?â Thus Dorigen complained unceasingly, Purposing evermore that she would die, But lingering on, till the third night was come: Arviragus, the worthy knight, came home, And questioned her why thus she wept so sore? And she again fell weeping ever the more. âAlas!â said she, âthat ever I was born! Thus have I said,â (quoth she,) âthus have I sworn:â And told him all, as ye have heard before; There needeth not I should rehearse it more. The husband, with glad cheer in friendly wise, Answer'd and said, as I shall you apprise. âIs there aught else, then, Dorigen, but this?â âNay, nay,â cried she, âso heaven me help, I wis 'Tis far too much, though it were God his will.â âSweet wife,â said he, âlet sleep what now is still: All may be well, perhaps, to-day,â he saith. âBut ye shall hold your truth, by my good faith; For God so wisely mercy have on me, I had far rather stabbed and ended be, For very love that I unto you have, Than you your truth should fail to keep and save. Truth is the highest thing that man may keep.â And with that word he suddenly 'gan weep; And said, âI you forbid, on pain of death, Ever, while with you lasteth life or breath, To tell of this mishap to any man. My woe I will endure as best I can; And show no face of doubt or heaviness, That folk of you may deem amiss, or guess.â And now he call'd a squire, and eke a maid: âGo forth anon, with Dorigen,â he said. They bring her presently unto the place, And take their leave; and then their way retrace; But nothing knew they why she thither went: She would to no wight tell of her intent. And now Aurelius, ever, as I ween, With amorous sorrow dreaming of Dorigene, Happen'd by chance his lady soon to meet Amid the town, and in the nearest street That led unto the way her steps were bent, And also tow'rds the garden, where she went. Aurelius tow'rds the garden sped him now, For well he knew whenever she might go Out of her house, to any other place. But thus they met by accident, or grace, And he saluteth her with glad intent, And asketh of her whitherward she went? And she replied, as though she were half mad, âUnto the garden, as my husband bade, My truth to save and hold, alas! alas!â Aurelius 'gan to ponder o'er this case;â And in his heart he had compassion great For her, her lamentation, and her state, And for Arviragus, the noble knight, Who bade her hold her promise as of right, So loath was he his wife should break her truth. And in his heart he caught of this great ruth; Considering 'twas the best on every side His passion rather he should quell or hide, Than like a base churl cause such high distress To generous honour and to gentilesse. Wherefore, in few words, to her said he thus. âMadam, say to your lord, Arviragus, That since I see the knightly nobleness Of him, and seeing also your distress;â That he would rather have shame (and this were ruth) Than ye to me should break your word and truth; I had far sooner suffer constant woe Than injure aught of love between you two. âI do release you, madam; in your hand Place each security and every bond That ye have giv'n to me, up to this day, Since ye were born,âas fully as I may. Take here my trothâI never will you grieve For promis'd love; and here I take my leave, As of the truest and the worthiest wife That ever yet I knew in all my life. But every wife beware of promised love; Like Dorigen they may not always prove. Thus can a squire perform a gentle deed, As well as can a knight, though his heart bleed.â She thanks Aurelius low on her knees bare, And home unto her husband doth she fare, And told him all, as ye have now heard said: And trust me this, he was so well repay'd That 'twere impossible for me to write. What should I further of this case indite? Arviragus, and Dorigen his wife, In sovran bliss henceforward lead their life. Never came grief or anger them between: He cherish'd her as though she were a queen; And she was true to him as heretofore. Now of these two ye get from me no more. Aurelius, thinking of his substance gone, Curseth the time that ever he was born. âAlas!â cried he, âI promised, in my strait, Of gold all pure a thousand pound of weight, To the philosopher! How shall I do? Nothing I see but ruin in the view. Mine heritage forthwith I needs must sell, And be a beggar. Here I will not dwell, Disgracing all my kindred in the place, Unless of him I get some better grace. But ne'ertheless I will of him essay At certain days, and year by year, to pay, And thank him much for his great courtesy. My promise will I keepâI will not lie.â With heart full sore, his chest-bags in his hold, To this philosopher he brought his gold, The value of five hundred pounds, I guess; And him beseecheth of his courteousness, To grant, for what remained, a longer term; And saying, âMaster, I dare well affirm I failÃ©d never of my truth, as yet; And certainly I will acquit my debt To you, however poorly I may fare To go a-begging in my kirtle bare. But would ye vouchsafe, on security, To grant me respite for two years or three, Then were I well; for else I needs must sell Mine heritage: there is no more to tell.â Then the philosopher answer'd soberly, And said thus, when this last request heard he,â âHave I not kept my covenant to thee?â âYes, certes; well and truly,â answer'd he. âHast thou not won thy love?â the other crieth. âNoâno,â Aurelius said; and sore he sigheth. âWhat was the cause?ânow tell me if you can.â His tale Aurelius woefully began, And told him all, as ye have heard before: It needeth not rehearsal any more. He said, âArviragus, from nobleness, Would rather die of sorrow and distress Than, false to truth, his noble wife behold.â The sorrow of Dorigen he also told; How loath she was to be a wicked wife, Wishing, instead, to lose that day her life; And that her word she gave through innocence: She never thought of magic, but fair sense. âThis gave me such great pity her to see, That freely as her husband sent to me, As freely sent I her to him again. This is the sum of allâmore words are vain.â Then answer'd the philosopher:ââGood brother, Each of ye acted nobly by the other: Thou art a squire; he is a worthy knight; And God forbid, in all his blissful might, But that a clerk a gentle deed should do, As wellâne'er doubt itâas this knight or you. âSir, I release thee of thy thousand pound, As if but now thoud'st crept out of the ground, And never till this moment had'st known me. For, Sir, I will not take a penny of thee, For all my craft, and all my labour given. The good cheer of thy house hath made us even. It is enough. Farewell! give you good day.â He took his horse, and forth he went his way.</field>
