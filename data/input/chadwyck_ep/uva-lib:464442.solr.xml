      <field name="fulltext">STEPS TO THE TEMPLE, Sacred Poems.Square brackets denote editorial insertions or emendations. WITH The Delights of the Muses. The Authors Motto. Live Jesus, Live, and let it bee My Life, to dye for love of thee. The Teare. 1 What bright soft thing is this Sweet Mary thy faire eyes expence? A moist sparke it is, A watry Diamond; from whence The very terme I thinke was found, The water of a Diamond. 2 O 'tis not a teare, 'Tis a star about to drop From thine eye its spheare, The Sun will stoope and take it up, Proud will his Sister be to weare This thine eyes Jewell in her eare. 3 O 'tis a teare, Too true a teare; for no sad eyne How sad so e're Raine so true a teare as thine; Each drop leaving a place so deare, Weeps for it self, is its owne teare. 4 Such a Pearle as this is (Slipt from Aurora's dewy Brest) The Rose buds sweet lip kisses; And such the Rose it self when vext With ungentle flames, does shed, Sweating in too warme a bed. 5 Such the Maiden gem By the wanton spring put on, Peeps from her Parent stem, And blushes on the watry Sun: This watry blossome of thy Eyne, Ripe, will make the richer Wine. 6 Faire drop, why quak'st thou so? Cause thou streight must lay thy head In the dust? ô no, The dust shall never be thy bed; A pillow for thee will I bring, Stuft with downe of Angels wing. 7 Thus carried up on high, (For to heaven thou must goe) Sweetly shalt thou lye, And in soft slumbers bath thy woe, Till the singing Orbes awake thee, And one of their bright Chorus make the. 8 There thy selfe shalt bee An eye, but not a weeping one, Yet I doubt of thee, Whether th'had'st rather there have shone, An eye of heaven; or still shine here, In th'Heaven of Maries eye a teare. Divine Epigrams. On the water of our Lords Baptisme. Each blest drop, on each blest limme, Is wash't it self, in washing him: 'Tis a gemme while it stayes here, While it falls hence, 'tis a Teare. Acts. 8. On the baptized Æthiopian. Let it no longer be a forlorne hope To wash an Æthiope: Hee's washt, his gloomy skin a peacefull shade For his white soule is made; And now, I doubt not, the Eternall Dove, A black-fac'd house will love. On the miracle of multiplyed Loaves. See here an easie Feast that knowes no wound, That under Hungers Teeth will needs be found, A subtle Harvest of unbounded bread, What would ye more? Here food it selfe is fed. Upon the Sepulcher of our Lord. Here where our Lord once laid his head Now the grave lyes buried. The Widows Mites. Two Mites, two drops, yet all her house and land Falls from a steady heart though trembling hand: The others wanton wealth foams high and brave; The other cast away, she onely gave. On the Prodigall. Tell me bright boy, tell me my golden Lad, Whither away so frolick? why so glad? What all thy wealth in counsaile? all thy state? Are huskes so deare? troth 'tis a mighty rate. Acts. 5. The sick implore St. Peters shadow. Under thy shadow may I lurke a while, Death's busie search I'le easily beguile; Thy shadow, Peter, must shew me the Sun My light's thy shadowes shadow, or 'tis done. On the still surviving marks of our Saviours wounds. What ever storie of their crueltie, Or Naile, or Thorne, or Speare have writ in thee. Are in another sence, Still legible, Sweet is the difference, Once I did spell Every red Letter A wound of thine Now (what is better) Balsome for mine. Mark. 7. The dumb healed and the people enjoyned silence. Christ bids the dumb tongue speak, it speakes, the sound He charges to be quiet, it runs round: If in the first he us'd his fingers touch, His hands whole strength here could not be too much. Mat. 28. Come see the place where the Lord lay. Shew me himself, himself (bright Sir) ô show Which way my poor teares to himself may goe; Were it enough to show the place and say Looke Mary here, see where thy Lord once lay, Then could I show these armes of mine, and say Looke Mary here, see where thy Lord once lay. To Pontius washing his hands. Thy hands are wash't, but ô the water's spilt That labour'd to have washt thy guilt; The flood, if any can, that can suffice, Must have its fountaine in thine eyes. To the infant Martyrs. Goe smiling soules, your new built Cages breake, In heaven you'l learne to sing, ere here to speake: Nor let the milkie fonts that bath your thirst Be your delay, The place that calls you hence, is at the worst Milke all the way. On the miracle of Loaves. Now Lord, or never, they'l beleeve on thee: Thou to their teeth hast prov'd thy Deity. Mark. 4. Why are ye afraid, O ye of little faith? As if the storme meant him, Or 'cause heavens face is dim, His needs a cloud: Was ever froward wind That could be so unkind? Or wave so proud? The wind had need be angry, and the water black, That to the mighty Neptune's self dare threaten wrack. There is no storme but this Of your owne Cowardise That braves you out; You are the storme that mocks Your selves; you are the rocks Of your owne doubt: Besides this feare of danger, ther's no danger here; And he that here feares danger, does deserve his feare. On the B. Virgins bashfullnesse. That on her lap she casts her humble eye, 'Tis the sweet pride of her humilitie. The faire starre is well fixt, for where, ô where, Could she have fixt it on a fairer spheare? 'Tis heaven, 'tis heaven she sees; Heaven's God there lyes, She can see heaven, and ne're lift up her eyes: This new guest to her eyes, new lawes hath given, 'Twas once looke up, 'tis now looke downe to heaven. Upon Lazarus his teares. Rich Lazarus! richer in those Gems thy Teares, Then Dives in the roabes he weares: He scorns them now, but ô they'l sute full well With th'Purple he must weare in hell. Two went up into the temple to pray. Two went to pray? ô rather say One went to brag, th'other to pray: One stands up close, and treads on high, Where th'other dares not send his eye; One neerer to God's Altar trod, The other to the Altars God. Upon the asse that bore our Saviour. Hath only anger an Omnipotence in Eloquence? Within the lips of love and joy doth dwell No miracle? Why else had Balaams asse a tongue to chide His masters pride? And thou (heaven burthen'd beast) hast ne're a word To praise thy Lord? That he should find a tongue and vocall thunder Was a great wonder, But ô me thinkes 'tis a farre greater one That thou find'st none. Mat. 8. I am not worthy that thou should'st come under my roofe. Thy God was making hast into thy roofe, Thy humble faith, and feare, keepes him aloofe: Hee'l be thy guest, because he may not be, Hee'l come—into thy house? no, into thee. I am the Doore. And now th'art set wide ope, the spear's sad art Lo! hath unlockt thee at the very heart: He to himselfe (I feare the worst) And his owne hope Hath shut these Doores of heaven, that durst Thus set them ope. Mat. 10. The blind cured by the word of our Saviour. Thou speak'st the word (Thy word's a Law) Thou spak'st and streight the blind man saw: To speake, and make the blind man see, Was never man Lord spake like thee! To speake thus was to speake (say I) Not to his eare, but to his eye. Mat. 27. And he answered them nothing. O mighty Nothing! unto thee, Nothing, we owe all things that bee. God spake once, when he all things made, He sav'd all when he Nothing said. The world was made of Nothing then; 'Tis made by Nothing now againe. To our Lord, upon the water made Wine. Thou water turn'st to wine (faire friend of life) Thy foe to crosse the sweet arts of thy reigne Distills from thence the tears of wrath and strife, And so turnes wine to water back againe. Mat. 22. Neither durst any man from that day, aske him any more questions. Mid'st all the darke and knotty snares, Black wit or malice can, or dares, Thy glorious wisedome breaks the Nets, And treds with uncontrouled steps; Thy quell'd foes are not onely now Thy triumphs, but thy Trophies too: They both at once thy Conquests bee, And thy Conquests memorie. Stony amazement makes them stand Wayting on thy victorious hand, Like statues fixed to the fame Of thy renoune, and their own shame, As if they onely meant to breath To be the life of their own death. Twas time to hold their peace, when they Had ne're another word to say, Yet is their silence unto thee, The full sound of thy victorie; Their silence speaks aloud, and is Thy well pronounc'd Panegyris. While they speak nothing, they speak all Their share in thy Memoriall. While they speake nothing, they proclame Thee, with the shrillest trump of fame. To hold their peace is all the wayes These wretches have to speake thy praise. Upon our Saviours tombe wherein never man was laid. How life and death in thee Agree! Thou had'st a virgin wombe, And tombe, A Joseph did betroth Them both. It is better to goe into heaven with one eye, &amp;c. One eye? a thousand rather, and a thousand more, To fix those full-fac't glories, ô hee's poore Of eyes that has but Argus store. Yet if thou'lt fil one poor eye, with thy heaven, &amp; thee, O grant (sweet goodnesse) that one eye may be All and every whit of me. Luke. 11. Upon the dumb Devill cast out, and the slanderous Jewes put to silence. Two devills at one blow thou hast laid flat, A speaking Devill this, a dumbe one that. Was't thy full victories fairer increase, That th'one spake, or that th'other held his peace? Luke. 10. And a certaine Priest comming that way, looked on him and passed by. Why doest thou wound my wounds, ô thou that passest by, Handling &amp; turning them with an unwounded eye? The calme that cooles thine eye does shipwrack mine, for ô, Unmov'd to see one wretched is to make him so. Luke. 11. Blessed be the Paps which thou hast sucked. Suppose he had been tabled at thy Teates, Thy hunger feels not what he eates: Hee'l have his Teat e're long, a bloody one, The mother then must suck the son. To Pontius washing his blood-stained hands. 'S murther no sin? Or a sin so cheape That thou did'st heape A Rape upon't? till thy adult'rous touch Taught her these sullied cheeks, this blubber'd face, She was a Nimph, the meadows knew none such, Of honest parentage, of unstain'd race, The daughter of a faire, and well fam'd fountaine, As ever Silver-tipt the side of shadie mountaine. See how she weeps, and weepes, that she appeares Nothing but teares, Each drop's a teare, that weeps for her owne wast; Harke how at every touch she does complaine her; Harke how she bids her frighted drops make hast, And with sad murmurs, chides the hands that staine her: Leave, leave for shame, or else (good judge) decree What water shal wash this, when this hath washed thee. Mat. 23. Yee build the Sepulchres of the Prophets. Thou trim'st a Prophets Tombe, and dost bequeath The life thou took'st from him unto his death: Vaine man! the stones that on his Tombe doe lye Keep but the score of them that made him dye. Upon the Infant Martyrs. To see both blended in one flood, The Mothers milke, the Childrens blood, Makes me doubt if heav'n will gather Roses hence, or Lillies rather. Joh. 16. Verily I say unto you, yee shall weep and lament. Welcome my Grief, my Joy; how deare's? To me my Legacie of Teares! I'le weepe, and weepe, and will therefore Weepe, 'cause I can weepe no more: Thou, thou (Deare Lord) even thou alone, Giv'st joy, even when thou givest none. John 15. Upon our Lord's last comfortable discourse with his Disciples. All Hybla's honey, all that sweetnesse can, Flowes in thy Song (ô faire, ô dying swan!) Yet is the joy I take in't small or none; It is too sweet to be a long-liv'd one. Luke 16. Dives asking a drop. A drop, one drop, how sweetly one faire drop Would tremble on my pearle-tipt fingers top? My wealth is gone, ô goe it where it will, Spare this one jewell; I'le be Dives still. Marke 12. (Give to Cæsar ?) (And to God ?) All we have is God's, and yet Cæsar challenges a debt, Nor hath God a thinner share, What ever Cæsar's payments are; All is God's; and yet 'tis true All we have is Cæsar's too; All is Cæsar's; and what ods, So long as Cæsar's selfe is Gods? But now they have seen and hated. Seene? and yet hated thee? they did not see, They saw thee not, that saw and hated thee: No, no, they saw thee not, ô Life, ô Love, Who saw ought in thee that their hate could move. Upon the Crowne of thornes taken downe from the head of our B. Lord bloody. Know'st thou this Souldier? 'tis a much chang'd plant, which yet Thy self did'st set, O! who so hard a husbandman did ever find, A soyle so kind? Is not the soyle a kind one which returnes Roses for Thornes? Luke 7. She began to wash his feet with teares, and wipe them with the haires of her head. Her eyes flood lickes his feetes faire staine, Her haires flame lickes up that againe: This flame thus quench't hath brighter beames, This flood thus stained, fairer streames. On St. Peter cutting off Malchus his eare. Well Peter dost thou wield thy active sword, Well for thy selfe (I meane) not for thy Lord: To strike at eares, is to take heed there be No witnesse Peter of thy perjury. Joh. 3. But men loved darknesse rather than light. The world's light shines, shine as it will, The world will love its Darkenesse still: I doubt though when the World's in Hell, It will not love its Darkenesse halfe so well. Acts. 21. I am readie not onely to be bound, but to die. Come death, come bands, nor do you shrink, my ears, At those hard words man's cowardise calls feares: Save those of feare no other bands feare I; No other feare than this, the feare to dye. On St. Peter casting away his Nets at our Saviours call. Thou hast the art on't Peter, and canst tell To cast thy Nets on all occasions well: When Christ calls, and thy Nets would have thee stay, To cast them well's to cast them quite away. Our B. Lord in his Circumcision to his Father. To thee these first fruits of my growing death (For what else is my life?) lo I bequeath: Tast this, and as thou lik'st this lesser flood Expect a Sea, my heart shall make it good. Thy wrath that wades here now, e're long shall swim, The floodgate shall be set wide ope for him. Then let him drinke, and drinke, and doe his worst To drowne the wantonnesse of his wild thirst. Now's but the Nonage of my paines, my feares Are yet both in their hopes, not come to yeares. The day of my darke woe is yet but morne, My teares but tender, and my death new borne. Yet may these unfledg'd griefes give fate some guesse, These Cradle-torments have their towardnesse. These purple buds of blooming death may bee, Erst the full stature of a fatall tree. And till my riper woes to age are come, This Knife may be the speares Præludium. On the wounds of our crucified Lord. O these wakefull wounds of thine! Are they Mouthes? or are they eyes? Be they mouthes, or be they eyne, Each bleeding part some one supplies. Lo, a mouth! whose full bloom'd lips At too deare a rate are roses: Lo, a blood-shot eye! that weeps, And many a cruell teare discloses. O thou that on this foot hast laid Many a kisse, and many a teare, Now thou shalt have all repaid, What soe're thy charges were. This foot hath got a mouth and lips To pay the sweet summe of thy kisses, To pay thy teares, an eye that weeps, Instead of teares, such gems as this is. The difference onely this appeares, (Nor can the change offend) The debt is paid in Ruby-teares Which thou in Pearles did'st lend. On our crucified Lord, naked and bloody. They have left thee naked Lord. O that they had; This Garment too, I would they had deny'd. Thee with thy selfe they have too richly clad, Opening the purple wardrobe of thy side: O never could there be garment too good For thee to weare, but this of thine owne blood. Sampson to his Dalilah. Could not once blinding mee, cruell suffice? When first I look't on thee I lost mine eyes. Psalme 23. Happy me! O happy sheepe! Whom my God vouchsafes to keepe; Even my God, even he it is That points me to these wayes of blisse; On whose pastures cheerefull spring, All the yeare doth sit and sing, And rejoycing smiles to see Their green backs weare his liverie: Pleasure sings my soule to rest, Plentie weares me at her brest, Whose sweet temper teaches me Nor wanton, nor in want to be. At my feet the blubb'ring Mountaine Weeping melts into a Fountaine, Whose soft silver-sweating streames Make high noone forget his beames: When my way-ward breath is flying, He calls home my soule from dying, Strokes, and tames my rabid griefe, And does wooe me into life: When my simple weakenes strayes, (Tangled in forbidden wayes) He (my shepheard) is my guide, Hee's before me, on my side, And behind me, he beguiles Craft in all her knottie wiles: He expounds the giddy wonder Of my weary steps, and under Spreads a Path as cleare as Day, Where no churlish rub says nay To my joy conducted feet, Whil'st they gladly goe to meet Grace and Peace, to meet new laies Tun'd to my great Shepheards praise. Come now all ye terrors, sally, Muster forth into the valley, Where triumphant darknesse hovers With a sable wing that covers Brooding horror. Come thou Death Let the damps of thy dull Breath Over shadow even the shade, And make darkenes selfe afraid; There my feet, even there, shall find Way for a resolved mind. Still my Shepheard, still my God Thou art with me, still thy Rod, And thy staffe, whose influence Gives direction, gives defence. At the whisper of thy word Crown'd abundance spreads my boord: While I feast, my foes doe feed Their ranck malice not their need, So that with the self same bread They are starv'd and I am fed. How my head in ointment swims! How my cup orelook's her brims! So, even so still may I move By the Line of thy deare love; Still may thy sweet mercy spread A shady arme above my head, About my Paths, so shall I find The faire center of my mind Thy Temple, and those lovely walls Bright ever with a beame that falls Fresh from the pure glance of thine eye, Lighting to eternity. There I'le dwell, for ever there Will I find a purer aire To feed my life with, there I'le sup Balme, and Nectar in my cup, And thence my ripe soule will I breath Warme into the Armes of Death. Psalme. 137. On the proud bankes of great Euphrates flood, There we sate, and there we wept: Our Harpes that now no musick understood, Nodding on the willowes slept, While unhappy captiv'd wee Lovely Sion thought on thee. They, they that snatcht us from our countries breast Would have a song carv'd to their eares In Hebrew numbers, then (ô cruell jest!) When Harpes and Hearts were drown'd in teares: Come, they cry'd, come sing and play One of Sions Songs to day. Sing? play? to whom (ah) shall we sing or play If not Jerusalem to thee? Ah thee Jerusalem! ah sooner may This hand forget the masterie Of Musicks dainty touch, then I The Musick of thy memory, Which when I lose, ô may at once my tongue Lose this same busie speaking art, Unpearch't, her vocall Arteries unstrung, No more acquainted with my heart, On my dry pallats roof to rest A wither'd leaf, an idle guest. No, no, thy good Sion alone must crowne The head of all my hope-nurst joyes. But Edom cruell thou! thou cryd'st downe, downe Sinke Sion, downe and never rise, Her falling thou did'st urge, and thrust, And haste to dash her into dust, Dost laugh? proud Babels daughter! do, laugh on, Till thy ruine teach thee teares, Even such as these; laugh, till a venging throng Of woes, too late doe rouze thy feares. Laugh till thy childrens bleeding bones Weepe pretious teares upon the stones. Upon Easter Day. 1 Rise heire of fresh eternity From thy virgin Tombe, Rise mighty man of wonders, and thy world with thee, Thy Tombe the universall East Natures new wombe, Thy tombe faire immortalities perfumed Nest. 2 Of all the glories make Noone gay, This is the Morne, This Rock bud's forth the fountaine of the streames of Day, In joyes white annalls lives this howre When life was borne, No cloud scoule on his radiant lids, no tempest lower. 3 Life, by this light's Nativity All creatures have, Death onely by this Dayes just doome is forc't to Dye Nor is Death forc't; for may he ly Thron'd in thy Grave Death will on this condition be content to dye. Sospetto d' Herode. Libro Primo. Argomento. Casting the times with their strong signes, Death's Master his owne death divines. Strugling for helpe, his best hope is Herod's suspition may heale his. Therefore he sends a fiend to wake, The sleeping Tyrant's fond mistake; Who feares (in vaine) that he whose Birth Meanes Heav'n, should meddle with his Earth. 1 Muse, now the servant of soft Loves no more, Hate is thy Theame, and Herod, whose unblest Hand (ô what dares not jealous Greatnesse?) tore A thousand sweet Babes from their Mothers Brest: The Bloomes of Martyrdome. O be a Dore Of language to my infant Lips, yee best Of Confessours: whose Throates answering his swords, Gave forth your Blood for breath, spoke soules for words. 2 Great Anthony! Spains well-beseeming pride, Thou mighty branch of Emperours and Kings; The Beauties of whose dawne what eye may bide? Which With the Sun himselfe weigh's equall wings; Mappe of Heroick worth! whom farre and wide To the beleeving world Fame boldly sings: Deigne thou to weare this humble Wreath, that bowes To be the sacred Honour of thy Browes. 3 Nor needs my Muse a blush, or these bright Flowers Other than what their owne blest beauties bring. They were the smiling sons of those sweet Bowers, That drinke the deaw of Life, whose deathlesse spring, Nor Sirian flame, nor Borean frost deflowers: From whence Heav'n-labouring Bees with busie wing, Suck hidden sweets, which well digested proves Immortall Hony for the Hive of Loves. 4 Thou, whose strong hand with so transcendent worth, Holds high the reine of faire Parthenope, That neither Rome, nor Athens can bring forth A Name in noble deeds Rivall to thee! Thy Fames full noise, makes proud the patient Earth, Farre more than matter for my Muse and mee. The Tyrrhene Seas, and shores sound all the same, And in their murmurs keepe thy mighty Name. 5 Below the Botome of the great Abysse, There where one Center reconciles all things; The worlds profound Heart pants; There placed is Mischiefes old Master, close about him clings A curl'd knot of embracing Snakes, that kisse His correspondent cheekes: these loathsome strings Hold the perverse Prince in eternall Ties Fast bound, since first he forfeited the skies. 6 The judge of Torments, and the King of Teares, He fills a burnisht Throne of quenchlesse fire: And for his old faire Roabes of Light, he weares A gloomy Mantle of darke flames, the Tire That crownes his hated head on high appeares; Where seav'n tall Hornes (his Empires pride) aspire. And to make up Hells Majesty, each Horne Seav'n crested Hydra's horribly adorne. 7 His Eyes, the sullen dens of Death and Night, Startle the dull Ayre with a dismall red: Such his fell glances as the fatall Light Of staring Comets, that looke Kingdomes dead. From his black nostrills, and blew lips, in spight Of Hells owne stinke, a worser stench is spread. His breath Hells lightning is: and each deepe groane Disdaines to thinke that Heav'n Thunders alone. 8 His flaming Eyes dire exhalation, Unto a dreadfull pile gives fiery Breath; Whose unconsum'd consumption preys upon That never-dying Life of a long Death. In this sad House of slow Destruction, (His shop of flames) hee fryes himself, beneath A masse of woes, his Teeth for Torment gnash, While his steele sides sound with his Tayles strong lash. 9 Three Rigourous Virgins waiting still behind, Assist the Throne of th'Iron-sceptred King. With whips of Thornes and knotty vipers twin'd They rouse him, when his ranke thoughts need a sting. Their lockes are beds of uncomb'd snakes that wind About their shady browes in wanton Rings. Thus reignes the wrathfull King, and while he reignes His Scepter and himselfe both he disdaines. 10 Disdainefull wretch! how hath one bold sinne cost Thee all the Beauties of thy once bright Eyes? How hath one black Eclipse cancell'd, and crost The glories that did gild thee in thy Rise? Proud Morning of a perverse Day! how lost Art thou unto thy selfe, thou too selfe-wise Narcissus? foolish Phaeton? who for all Thy high-aym'd hopes, gaind'st but a flaming fall. 11 From Death's sad shades, to the Life-breathing Ayre, This mortall Enemy to mankinds good, Lifts his Malignant Eyes, wasted with care, To become beautifull in humane blood. Where ‘Jordan melts his Chrystall, to make faire The fields of Palestine, with so pure a flood, There does he fixe his Eyes: and there detect New matter, to make good his great suspect. 12 He calls to mind th'old quarrell, and what sparke Set the contending Sons of Heav'n on fire: Oft in his deepe thought he revolves the darke Sibills divining leaves: he does enquire Into th'old Prophesies, trembling to marke How many present prodigies conspire, To crowne their past predictions, both he layes Together, in his pondrous mind both weighs. 13 Heavens Golden-winged Herald, late he saw To a poore Galilean virgin sent: How low the Bright Youth bow'd, and with what awe Immortall flowers to her faire hand present. He saw th'old Hebrewes wombe, neglect the Law Of Age and Barennesse, and her Babe prevent His Birth, by his Devotion, who began Betimes to be a Saint, before a Man. 14 He saw rich Nectar thawes release the rigour Of th'Icy North, from frost-bount Atlas hands His Adamantine fetters fall: green vigour Gladding the Scythian Rocks, and Libian sands. He saw a vernall smile, sweetly disfigure Winters sad face, and through the flowry lands Of faire Engaddi hony-sweating Fountaines With Manna, Milk, and Balm, new broach the Mountaines. 15 He saw how in that blest Day-bearing Night, The Heav'n-rebuked shades made hast away; How bright a Dawne of Angels with new Light Amaz'd the midnight world, and made a Day Of which the Morning knew not: Mad with spight He markt how the poore Shepheards ran to pay Their simple Tribute to the Babe, whose Birth Was the great businesse both of Heav'n and Earth. 16 He saw a threefold Sun, with rich encrease, Make proud the Ruby portalls of the East. He saw the Temple sacred to sweet Peace, Adore her Princes Birth, flat on her Brest. He saw the falling Idolls, all confesse A comming Deity. He saw the Nest Of pois'nous and unnaturall loves, Earth-nurst; Toucht with the worlds true Antidote to burst. 17 He saw Heav'n blossome with a new-borne light, On which, as on a glorious stranger gaz'd The Golden eyes of Night: whose Beame made bright The way to Beth'lem, and as boldly blaz'd, (Nor askt leave of the Sun) by Day as Night. By whom (as Heav'ns illustrious Hand-maid) rais'd Three Kings (or what is more) three Wise men went Westward to find the worlds true Orient. 18 Strucke with these great concurrences of things, Symptomes so deadly, unto Death and him; Faine would he have forgot what fatall strings, Eternally bind each rebellious limbe. He shooke himselfe, and spread his spatious wings: Which like two Bosom'd sailes embrace the dimme Aire, with a dismall shade, but all in vaine, Of sturdy Adamant is his strong chaine. 19 While thus Heav'ns highest counsails, by the low Foot steps of their Effects, he trac'd too well, He tost his troubled eyes, Embers that glow Now with new Rage, and wax too hot for Hell. With his foule clawes he fenc'd his furrowed Brow, And gave a gastly shreeke, whose horrid yell Ran trembling through the hollow vaults of Night, The while his twisted Tayle he gnaw'd for spight. 20 Yet on the other side, faine would he start Above his feares, and thinke it cannot be. He studies Scripture, strives to sound the heart, And feele the pulse of every Prophecy. He knows (but knowes not how, or by what Art) The Heav'n expecting Ages, hope to see A mighty Babe, whose pure, unspotted Birth, From a chast Virgin wombe, should blesse the Earth. 21 But these vast Mysteries his senses smother, And Reason (for what's Faith to him?) devoure. How she that is a maid should prove a Mother, Yet keepe inviolate her virgin flower; How Gods eternall Sonne should be mans Brother, Poseth his proudest Intellectuall power. How a pure Spirit should incarnate bee, And life it selfe weare Deaths fraile Livery. 22 That the Great Angell-blinding light should shrinke His blaze, to shine in a poore Shepherds eye. That the unmeasur'd God so low should sinke, As Pris'ner in a few poore Rags to lye. That from his Mothers Brest he milke should drinke, Who feeds with Nectar Heav'ns faire family. That a vile Manger his low Bed should prove, Who in a Throne of stars Thunders above. 23 That he whom the Sun serves, should faintly peepe Through clouds of Infant flesh: that he the old Eternall Word should be a Child, and weepe. That he who made the fire, should feare the cold; That Heav'ns high Majesty his Court should keepe In a clay cottage, by each blast control'd. That Glories self should serve our Griefs, &amp; feares: And free Eternity, submit to yeares. 24 And further, that the Lawes eternall Giver, Should bleed in his owne lawes obedience: And to the circumcising Knife deliver Himselfe, the forfet of his slaves offence. That the unblemisht Lambe, blessed for ever, Should take the marke of sin, and paine of sence. These are the knotty Riddles, whose darke doubt Intangles his lost Thoughts, past getting out. 25 While new Thoughts boyl'd in his enraged Brest, His gloomy Bosomes darkest Character, Was in his shady forehead seen exprest. The forehead's shade in Griefes expression there, Is what in signe of joy among the blest The faces lightning, or a smile is here. Those stings of care that his strong Heart opprest, A desperate, Oh mee, drew from his deepe Brest. 26 Oh mee! (thus bellow'd he) oh mee! what great Portents before mine eyes their Powers advance? And serves my purer sight, onely to beat Downe my proud Thought, and leave it in a Trance? Frowne I; and can great Nature keep her seat? And the gay starrs lead on their Golden dance? Can his attempts above still prosp'rous be, Auspicious still, in spight of Hell and me? 27 Hee has my Heaven (what would he more?) whose bright And radiant Scepter this bold hand should beare. And for the never-fading fields of Light, My faire Inheritance, he confines me here, To this darke House of shades, horrour, and Night, To draw a long-liv'd Death, where all my cheere Is the solemnity my sorrow weares, That Mankinds Torment waits upon my Teares. 28 Darke, dusky Man, he needs would single forth, To make the partner of his owne pure ray: And should we Powers of Heav'n, Spirits of worth, Bow our bright Heads, before a King of clay? It shall not be, said I, and clombe the North, Where never wing of Angell yet made way. What though I mist my blow? yet I strooke high, And to dare something, is some victory. 29 Is he not satisfied? meanes he to wrest Hell from me too, and sack my Territories? Vile humane Nature means he not t'invest (O my despight!) with his divinest Glories? And rising with rich spoiles upon his Brest, With his faire Triumphs fill all future stories? Must the bright armes of Heav'n, rebuke these eyes? Mocke me, and dazle my darke Mysteries? 30 Art thou not Lucifer? he to whom the droves Of Stars, that gild the Morne in charge were given? The nimblest of the lightning-winged Loves? The fairest, and the first-borne smile of Heav'n? Looke in what Pompe the Mistrisse Planet moves Rev'rently circled by the lesser seaven, Such, and so rich, the flames that from thine eyes, Opprest the common-people of the skyes. 31 Ah wretch! what bootes thee to cast back thy eyes, Where dawning hope no beame of comfort showes? While the reflection of thy forepast joyes, Renders thee double to thy present woes. Rather make up to thy new miseries, And meet the mischiefe that upon thee growes. If Hell must mourne, Heav'n sure shall sympathize; What force cannot effect, fraud shall devise. 32 And yet whose force feare I? have I so lost My selfe? my strength too with my innocence? Come try who dares, Heav'n, Earth, what ere dost boast, A borrowed being, make thy bold defence. Come thy Creator too, what though it cost Me yet a second fall? wee 'd try our strengths. Heav'n saw us struggle once, as brave a fight Earth now should see, and tremble at the sight. 33 Thus spoke th'impatient Prince, and made a pause; His foule Hags rais'd their heads, &amp; clapt their hands. And all the Powers of Hell in full applause Flourisht their Snakes, and tost their flaming brands. We (said the horrid sisters) wait thy lawes, Th'obsequious handmaids of thy high commands. Be it thy part, Hells mighty Lord, to lay On us thy dread commands, ours to obey. 34 What thy Alecto, what these hands can doe, Thou mad'st bold proofe upon the brow of Heav'n, Nor should'st thou bate in pride, because that now, To these thy sooty Kingdomes thou art driven. Let Heav'ns Lord chide above lowder than thou In language of his Thunder, thou art even With him below: here thou art Lord alone Boundlesse and absolute: Hell is thine owne. 35 If usuall wit, and strength will doe no good, Vertues of stones, nor herbes: use stronger charmes, Anger, and love, best hookes of humane blood. If all faile wee 'l put on our proudest Armes, And pouring on Heav'ns face the Seas huge flood Quench his curl'd fires, wee 'l wake with our Alarmes Ruine, where e're she sleepes at Natures feet; And crush the world till his wide corners meet. 36 Reply'd the proud King, O my Crownes Defence, Stay of my strong hopes, you of whose brave worth, The frighted stars tooke faint experience, When 'gainst the Thunders mouth we marched forth: Still you are prodigall of your Love's expence In our great projects, both 'gainst Heav'n and Earth. I thanke you all, but one must single out, Cruelty, she alone shall cure my doubt. 37 Fourth of the cursed knot of Hags is shee, Or rather all the other three in one; Hells shop of slaughter shee do's oversee, And still assist the Execution. But chiefly there do's she delight to be, Where Hells capacious Cauldron is set on: And while the black soules boile in their own gore, To hold them down, and looke that none seeth o're. 38 Thrice howl'd the Caves of Night, and thrice the sound, Thundring upon the bankes of those black lakes Rung, through the hollow vaults of Hell profound: At last her listning Eares the noise o're takes, She lifts her sooty lampes, and looking round, A gen'rall hisse from the whole Tire of snakes Rebounding, through Hells inmost Cavernes came, In answer to her formidable Name. 39 'Mongst all the Palaces in Hells command, No one so mercilesse as this of hers. The Adamantine Doors, for ever stand Impenetrable, both to prai'rs and Teares, The walls inexorable steele, no hand Of Time, or Teeth of hungry Ruine feares. Their ugly ornaments are the bloody staines, Of ragged limbs, torne sculls, &amp; dasht out Braines. 40 There has the purple Vengeance a proud seat, Whose ever-brandisht Sword is sheath'd in blood. About her Hate, Wrath, Warre, and Slaughter sweat; Bathing their hot limbs in life's pretious flood. There rude impetuous Rage do's storme, and fret: And there, as Master of this murd'ring brood, Swinging a huge Sith stands impartiall Death, With endlesse businesse almost out of Breath. 41 For hangings and for Curtaines, all along The walls, (abominable ornaments!) Are tooles of wrath, Anvills of Torments hung; Fell Executioners of foule intents, Nailes, hammers, hatchets sharpe, and halters strong, Swords, Speares, with all the fatall Instruments Of sin, and Death, twice dipt in the dire staines Of brothers mutuall blood, and Fathers braines. 42 The Tables furnisht with a cursed Feast, Which Harpyes, with leane Famine feed upon, Unfill'd for ever. Here among the rest, Inhumane Erisi-cthon too makes one; Tantalus, Atreus, Progne, here are guests: Wolvish Lycaon here a place hath won. The cup they drinke in is Medusa's scull, Which mixt with gall &amp; blood they quaffe brim full. 43 The foule Queens most abhorred Maids of Honour Medæa, Jezabell, many a meager Witch, With Circe, Scylla, stand to wait upon her: But her best huswifes are the Parcæ, which Still worke for her, and have their wages from her: They prick a bleeding heart at every stitch. Her cruell cloathes of costly threds they weave, Which short-cut lives of murdred Infants leave. 44 The house is hers'd about with a black wood, Which nods with many a heavy headed tree. Each flowers a pregnant poyson, try'd and good, Each herbe a Plague. The winds sighes timed-bee By a black Fount, which weeps into a flood. Through the thick shades obscurely might you see Minotaures, Cyclopses, with a darke drove Of Dragons, Hydraes, Sphinxes, fill the Grove. 45 Here Diomed's Horses, Phereus dogs appeare, With the fierce Lyons of Therodamas. Busiris ha's his bloody Altar here, Here Sylla his severest prison has. The Lestrigonians here their Table reare; Here strong Procrustes Plants his Bed of Brasse. Here cruell Scyron boasts his bloody rockes, And hatefull Schinis his so feared Oakes. 46 What ever Schemes of Blood, fantastick-frames Of Death Mezentius, or Geryon drew; Phalaris, Ochus, Ezelinus, names Mighty in mischiefe, with dread Nero too, Here are they all, Here all the swords or flames Assyrian Tyrants, or Egyptian knew. Such was the House, so furnisht was the Hall, Whence the fourth Fury, answer'd Pluto's call. 47 Scarce to this Monster could the shady King, The horrid summe of his intentions tell; But shee (swift as the momentary wing Of lightning, or the words he spoke) left Hell. She rose, and with her to our world did bring, Pale proofe of her fell presence, Th'aire too well With a chang'd countenance witnest the sight, And poore fowles intercepted in their flight. 48 Heav'n saw her rise, and saw Hell in the sight. The field's faire Eyes saw her, and saw no more, But shut their flowry lids, for ever Night, And Winter strow her way; yea, such a sore Is she to Nature, that a generall fright, An universall palsie spreading o're The face of things, from her dire eyes had run, Had not her thick Snakes hid them from the Sun. 49 Now had the Night's companion from her den, Where all the busie day she close doth ly, With her soft wing wipt from the browes of men Day's sweat, and by a gentle Tyranny, And sweet oppression, kindly cheating them Of all their cares, tam'd the rebellious eye Of sorrow, with a soft and downy hand, Sealing all brests in a Lethæan band. 50 When the Erinnys her black pineons spread, And came to Bethlem, where the cruell King Had now retyr'd himselfe, and borrowed His Brest a while from care's unquiet sting; Such as at Thebes dire feast she shew'd her head, Her sulphur-breathed Torches brandishing, Such to the frighted Palace now she comes, And with soft feet searches the silent roomes. 51 By Herod ? now was borne The Scepter, which of old great David swaid; Whose right by David's image so long worne, Himselfe a stranger to, his owne had made; And from the head of Judahs house quite torne The Crowne, for which upon their necks he laid A sad yoake, under which they sigh'd in vaine, And looking on their lost state sigh'd againe. 52 Up, through the spatious Pallace passed she, To where the Kings proudly-reposed head (If any can be soft to Tyranny And selfe-tormenting sin) had a soft bed. She thinkes not fit such he her face should see, As it is seene by Hell; and seen with dread. To change her faces stile she doth devise, And in a pale Ghost's shape to spare his Eyes. 53 Her selfe a while she layes aside, and makes Ready to personate a mortall part. Joseph the Kings dead Brothers shape she takes, What he by Nature was, is she by Art. She comes toth' King, and with her cold hand slakes His Spirits, the Sparkes of Life, and chills his heart, Lifes forge; fain'd is her voice, and false too, be Her words; sleep'st thou fond man? sleep'st thou? said she. 54 So sleeps a Pilot, whose poore Barke is prest With many a mercylesse o're mastring wave; For whom (as dead) the wrathfull winds contest, Which of them deep'st shall digge her watry Grave. Why dost thou let thy brave soule lye supprest, In Death-like slumbers; while thy dangers crave A waking eye and hand? looke up and see The fates ripe, in their great conspiracy. 55 Know'st thou not how of th'Hebrewes royall stemme (That old dry stocke) a despair'd branch is sprung A most strange Babe! who here conceal'd by them In a neglected stable lies, among Beasts and base straw: Already is the streame Quite turn'd: th'ingratefull Rebells this their young Master (with voyce free as the Trumpe of Fame) Their new King, and thy Successour proclame. 56 What busy motions; what wild Engines stand On tiptoe in their giddy Braynes? th'have fire Already in their Bosomes; and their hand Already reaches at a sword; They hire Poysons to speed thee; yet through all the Land What one comes to reveale what they conspire? Goe now, make much of these; wage still their wars And bring home on thy Brest more thanklesse scarrs. 57 Why did I spend my life, and spill my Blood, That thy firme hand for ever might sustaine A well-pois'd Scepter? does it now seeme good Thy brothers blood be-spilt, life spent in vaine? 'Gainst thy owne sons and Brothers thou hast stood In Armes, when lesser cause was to complaine: And now crosse Fates a watch about thee keepe, Can'st thou be carelesse now? now can'st thou sleep? 58 Where art thou man? what cowardly mistake Of thy great selfe, hath stolne King Herod from thee? O call thy selfe home to thy self, wake, wake, And fence the hanging sword Heav'n throws upon thee. Redeeme a worthy wrath rouse thee, and shake Thy selfe into a shape that may become thee. Be Herod, and thou shalt not misse from mee Immortall stings to thy great thoughts, and thee. 59 So said, her richest snake, which to her wrist For a beseeming bracelet she had ty'd (A speciall Worme it was as ever kist The foamy lips of Cerberus) she apply'd To the Kings Heart, the Snake no sooner hist, But vertue heard it, and away she hy'd, Dire flames diffuse themselves through every veine, This done, Home to her Hell she hy'd amaine. 60 He wakes, and with him (ne're to sleepe) new feares: His Sweat-bedewed Bed hath now betrai'd him, To a vast field of thornes, ten thousand Speares All pointed in his heart seem'd to invade him: So mighty were th'amazing Characters With which his feeling Dreame had thus dismay'd him, He his owne fancy-framed foes defies: In rage, My armes, give me my armes, he cryes. 61 As when a Pile of food-preparing fire, The breath of artificiall lungs embraves, The Caldron-prison'd waters streight conspire, And beat the hot Brasse with rebellious waves: He murmurs, and rebukes their bold desire; Th'impatient liquor, frets, and foames, and raves; Till his o're flowing pride suppresse the flame, Whence all his high spirits, and hot courage came. 62 So boyles the fired Herods blood-swolne brest, Not to be slakt but by a Sea of blood. His faithlesse Crowne he feeles loose on his Crest, Which on false Tyrants head ne're firmely stood. The worme of jealous envy and unrest, To which his gnaw'd heart is the growing food, Makes him impatient of the lingring light; Hate the sweet peace of all-composing Night. 63 A Thousand Prophecies that talke strange things, Had sowne of old these doubts in his deepe brest. And now of late came tributary Kings, Bringing him nothing but new feares from th'East, More deepe suspicions, and more deadly stings, With which his feav'rous cares their cold increast. And now his dream (Hels firebrand) stil more bright, Shew'd him his feares, and kill'd him with the sight. 64 No sooner therefore shall the Morning see (Night hangs yet heavy on the lids of Day) But all his Counsellours must summon'd bee, To meet their troubled Lord: Without delay Heralds and Messengers immediately Are sent about, who poasting every way To th'heads and Officers of every band; Declare who sends, and what is his command. 65 Why art thou troubled Herod? what vaine feare Thy blood-revolving Brest to rage doth move? Heavens King, who doffs himselfe weak flesh to weare, Comes not to rule in wrath, but serve in love. Nor would he this thy fear'd Crown from thee Teare, But give thee a better with himselfe above. Poore jealousie! why should he wish to prey Upon thy Crowne, who gives his owne away? 66 Make to thy reason man, and mock thy doubts, Looke how below thy feares their causes are; Thou art a Souldier Herod; send thy Scouts, See how hee's furnish't for so fear'd a warre? What armour does he weare? A few thin clouts. His Trumpets? tender cries; his men to dare So much? rude Shepheards; What his steeds? Alas Poore Beasts! a slow Oxe, and a simple Asse. Il fine del primo Libro. On Mr. George Herberts booke intituled the Temple of Sacred Poems, sent to a Gentle-woman. Know you faire on what you looke; Divinest love lyes in this booke: Expecting fier from your eyes, To kindle this his sacrifice. When your hands untie these strings, Think yo'have an Angell by the wings. One that gladly will be nigh, To waite upon each morning sigh. To flutter in the balmy aire, Of your well-perfumed praier; These white plumes of his hee'l lend you, Which every day to heaven will send you: To take acquaintance of the spheare, And all the smooth-fac'd kindred there. And though Herbert's name doe owe These devotions, fairest, know That while I lay them on the shrine Of your white hand, they are mine. On a treatise of Charity. Rise then, immortall maid! Religion rise! Put on thy self in thine owne lookes; t'our eyes Be what thy beauties, not our blots have made thee, Such as (ere our darke sinnes to dust betrayed thee) Heav'n set thee down new drest; when thy bright birth Shot thee like lightning, to th'astonisht earth. From th'dawn of thy faire eye-lids wipe away, Dull mists, and melancholy clouds; take day And thine owne beames about thee, bring the best Of what so'ere perfum'd thy Eastern Nest. Girt all thy glories to thee: then sit down, Open thy booke, faire Queen, and take thy crowne. These learned leaves shall vindicate to thee, Thy holiest, humblest, hand-maid Charitie. She'l dresse thee like thy self, set thee on high, Where thou shall reach all hearts, command each eye, Lo where I see thy off'rings wake, and rise, From the pale dust of that strange sacrifice, Which they themselves were; each one putting on A majestie that may beseeme thy throne. The Holy youth of Heav'n whose golden rings Girt round thy awfull altars, with bright wings Fanning thy faire locks (which the world beleeves, As much as sees) shall with these sacred leaves Trick their tall plumes, and in that garbe shall go, If not more glorious, more conspicuous tho. —Be it enacted then By the faire lawes of thy firm pointed pen, God's services no longer shall put on A sluttishnesse, for pure religion: No longer shall our Churches frighted stones Lie scatter'd like the burnt and martyr'd bones Of dead Devotion; nor faint marbles weep In their sad ruines; nor Religion keep A melancholy mansion in those cold Urns. Like God's Sanctuaries they look't of old: Now seeme they Temples consecrate to none, Or to a new God desolation. No more the Hypocrite shall th'upright bee Because he's stiffe, and will confesse no knee: While others bend their knee, no more shalt thou (Disdainefull dust and ashes) bend thy brow; Nor on God's Altar cast two scortching eyes Bak't in hot scorn, for a burnt sacrifice: But (for a Lambe) thy tame and tender heart New struck by love, still trembling on his dart; Or (for two Turtle Doves) it shall suffice To bring a paire of meek and humble eyes. This shall from henceforth be the masculine theme Pulpits and pens shall sweat in; to redeeme Vertue to action, that life-feeding flame That keepes Religion warme; not swell a name Of faith, a mountaine word, made up of aire, With those deare spoiles that wont to dresse the faire And fruitfull Charities full breasts (of old) Turning her out to tremble in the cold. What can the poore hope from us, when we bee Uncharitable ev'n to Charitie? FINIS. THE DELIGHTS OF THE MUSES. OR, Other Poems written on severall occasions. Dic mihi quid melius desidiosus agas. Mart. Musicks Duell. Now Westward Sol had spent the richest Beams Of Noons high Glory, when hard by the streams Of Tiber, on the sceane of a greene plat, Under protection of an Oake; there sate A sweet Lutes-master: in whose gentle aires He lost the Dayes heat, and his owne hot cares. Close in the covert of the leaves there stood A Nightingale, come from the neighbouring wood: (The sweet inhabitant of each glad Tree, Their Muse, their Syren, harmlesse Syren she) There stood she listning, and did entertaine The Musicks soft report: and mold the same In her owne murmures, that what ever mood His curious fingers lent, her voyce made good: The man perceiv'd his Rivall, and her Art, Dispos'd to give the light-foot Lady sport Awakes his Lute, and 'gainst the fight to come Informes it, in a sweet Præludium Of closer straines, and ere the warre begin, He lightly skirmishes on every string Charg'd with a flying touch: and streightway she Carves out her dainty voyce as readily, Into a thousand sweet distinguish'd Tones, And reckons up in soft divisions, Quicke volumes of wild Notes; to let him know By that shrill taste, she could do something too. His nimble hands instinct then taught each string A capring cheerefullnesse; and made them sing To their owne dance; now negligently rash He throwes his Arme, and with a long drawne dash Blends all together; then distinctly tripps From this to that; then quicke returning skipps And snatches this again, and pauses there. Shee measures every measure, every where Meets art with art; sometimes as if in doubt, Not perfect yet, and fearing to be out, Trayles her plaine Ditty in one long-spun note, Through the sleeke passage of her open throat, A cleare unwrinckled song; then doth shee point it With tender accents, and severely joynt it By short diminutives, that being rear'd In controverting warbles evenly shar'd, With her sweet selfe shee wrangles. Hee amazed That from so small a channell should be rais'd The torrent of a voyce, whose melody Could melt into such sweet variety, Straines higher yet; that tickled with rare art The tatling strings (each breathing in his part) Most kindly doe fall out; the grumbling Base In surly groans disdaines the Trebles Grace; The high-perch't treble chirps at this, and chides, Untill his finger (Moderatour) hides And closes the sweet quarrell, rowsing all Hoarce, shrill, at once; as when the Trumpets call Hot Mars to th'Harvest of Deaths field, and woo Mens hearts into their hands: this lesson too Shee gives him back; her supple Brest thrills out Sharpe Aires, and staggers in a warbling doubt Of dallying sweetnesse, hovers o're her skill, And folds in wav'd notes with a trembling bill The plyant Series of her slippery song; Then starts shee suddenly into a Throng Of short thicke sobs, whose thundring volleyes float, And roule themselves over her lubrick throat In panting murmurs, still'd out of her Breast, That ever-bubling spring; the sugred Nest Of her delicious soule, that there does lye Bathing in streames of liquid Melodie; Musicks best seed-plot, where in ripen'd Aires A Golden-headed Harvest fairely reares His Honey-dropping tops, plow'd by her breath Which there reciprocally laboureth In that sweet soyle, it seemes a holy quire Founded to th'Name of great Apollo's lyre, Whose silver-roofe rings with the sprightly notes Of sweet-lipp'd Angell-Imps, that swill their throats In creame of Morning Helicon, and then Preferre soft-Anthems to the Eares of men, To woo them from their Beds, still murmuring That men can sleepe while they their Mattens sing: (Most divine service) whose so early lay, Prevents the Eye lidds of the blushing day! There you might heare her kindle her soft voyce, In the close murmur of a sparkling noyse, And lay the ground-worke of her hopefull song, Still keeping in the forward streame, so long Till a sweet whirle-wind (striving to get out) Heaves her soft Bosome, wanders round about, And makes a pretty Earthquake in her Breast, Till the fledg'd Notes at length forsake their Nest, Fluttering in wanton shoales, and to the Sky Wing'd with their owne wild Eccho's pratling fly. Shee opes the floodgate, and lets loose a Tide Of streaming sweetnesse, which in state doth ride On the wav'd backe of every swelling straine, Rising and falling in a pompous traine. And while she thus discharges a shrill peale Of flashing Aires; she qualifies their zeale With the coole Epode of a graver Noat, Thus high, thus low, as if her silver throat Would reach the brasen voyce of war's hoarce Bird; Her little soule is ravisht: and so pour'd Into loose extasies, that shee is plac't Above her selfe, Musicks Enthusiast. Shame now and anger mixt a double staine In the Musitians face; yet once againe (Mistresse) I come; now reach a straine my Lute Above her mocke, or be for ever mute. Or tune a song of victory to me, Or to thy selfe, sing thine owne Obsequie; So said, his hands sprightly as fire he flings, And with a quavering coynesse tasts the strings. The sweet-lip't sisters musically frighted, Singing their feares are fearefully delighted. Trembling as when Appollo's golden haires Are fan'd and frizled, in the wanton ayres Of his own breath: which marryed to his lyre Doth tune the Sphæares, and make Heavens selfe looke higher From this to that, from that to this he flyes Feeles Musicks pulse in all her Arteryes, Caught in a net which there Apollo spreads, His fingers struggle with the vocall threads, Following those little rills, he sinkes into A Sea of Helicon; his hand does goe Those parts of sweetnesse which with Nectar drop, Softer then that which pants in Hebe's cup. The humourous strings expound his learned touch, By various Glosses; now they seeme to grutch, And murmur in a buzzing dinne, then gingle In shrill tongu'd accents: striving to be single. Every smooth turne, every delicious stroake Gives life to some new Grace; thus doth h'invoke Sweetnesse by all her Names; thus, bravely thus (Fraught with a fury so harmonious) The Lutes light Genius now does proudly rise, Heav'd on the surges of swolne Rapsodyes. Whose flourish (Meteor-like) doth curle the aire With flash of high-borne fancyes: here and there Dancing in lofty measures, and anon Creeps on the soft touch of a tender tone: Whose trembling murmurs melting in wild aires Runs to and fro, complaining his sweet cares Because those pretious mysteryes that dwell, In musick's ravish't soule he dares not tell, But whisper to the world: thus doe they vary Each string his Note, as if they meant to carry Their Masters blest soule (snatcht out at his Eares By a strong Extasy) through all the sphæares Of Musicks heaven; and seat it there on high In th'Empyræum of pure Harmony. At length (after so long, so loud a strife Of all the strings, still breathing the best life Of blest variety attending on His fingers fairest revolution In many a sweet rise; many as sweet a fall) A full-mouth Diapason swallowes all. This done, he lists what she would say to this, And she although her Breath's late exercise Had dealt too roughly with her tender throate, Yet summons all her sweet powers for a Noate Alas! in vaine! for while (sweet soule) she tryes To measure all those wild diversities Of chatt'ring strings, by the small size of one Poore simple voyce, rais'd in a naturall Tone; She failes, and failing grieves; and grieving dyes. She dyes: and leaves her life the Victors prise, Falling upon his Lute; ô fit to have (That liv'd so sweetly) dead, so sweet a Grave! Out of Martiall. Foure Teeth thou had'st that ranck'd in goodly state Kept thy Mouthes Gate. The first blast of thy cough left two alone, The second, none. This last cough Ælia, cought out all thy feare, Th'hast left the third cough now no businesse here. In the praise of the Spring. Out of Virgil, All Trees, all leavy Groves confesse the Spring Their gentle friend, then, then the lands begin To swell with forward pride, and seed desire To generation; Heavens Almighty Sire Melts on the Bosome of his Love, and powres Himselfe into her lap in fruitfull showers. And by a soft insinuation, mixt With earths large Masse, doth cherish and assist Her weake conceptions; No lone shade, but rings With chatting Birds delicious murmurings. Then Venus mild instinct (at set times) yields The Herds to kindly meetings, then the fields (Quick with warme Zephyres lively breath) lay forth Their pregnant Bosomes in a fragrant Birth. Each body's plump and jucy, all things full Of supple moisture: no coy twig but will Trust his beloved bosome to the Sun (Growne lusty now;) No Vine so weake and young That feares the foule-mouth'd Auster or those stormes That the Southwest-wind hurries in his Armes, But hasts her forward Blossomes, and layes out Freely layes out her leaves: Nor doe I doubt But when the world first out of Chaos sprang So smil'd the Dayes, and so the tenor ran Of their felicity. A spring was there, An everlasting spring, the jolly yeare Led round in his great circle; No winds Breath As then did smell of Winter, or of Death. When Lifes sweet Light first shone on Beasts, and when From their hard Mother Earth, sprang hardy men, When Beasts tooke up their lodging in the Wood, Starres in their higher Chambers: never cou'd The tender growth of things endure the sence Of such a change, but that the Heav'ns Indulgence Kindly supplyes sick Nature, and doth mold A sweetly temper'd meane, nor hot nor cold. With a Picture sent to a Friend. I paint so ill my peece had need to be Painted againe by some good Poesie. I write so ill, my slender Line is scarce So much as th'Picture of a well-lim'd verse: Yet may the love I send be true, though I Send nor true Picture, nor true Poesie. Both which away, I should not need to feare, My Love, or Feign'd or painted should appeare. The beginning of Helidorus. The smiling Morne had newly wak't the Day, And tipt the Mountaines with a tender ray: When on a hill (whose high Imperious brow Lookes downe, and sees the humble Nile below Licke his proud feet, and haste into the seas Through the great mouth that's nam'd from Hercules) A band of men, rough as the Armes they wore Look't round, first to the sea, then to the shore. The shore that shewed them what the sea deny'd, Hope of a prey. There to the maine land ty'd A ship they saw, no men she had; yet prest Appear'd with other lading, for her brest Deep in the groaning waters wallowëd Up to the third Ring; o're the shore was spread Death's purple triumph, on the blushing ground Lifes late forsaken houses all lay drown'd In their owne bloods deare deluge, some new dead, Some panting in their yet warme ruines bled: While their affrighted soules, now wing'd for flight Lent them the last flash of her glimmering light. Those yet fresh streames which crawled every where Shew'd that sterne warre had newly bath'd him there. Nor did the face of this disaster show Markes of a fight alone, but feasting too, A miserable and a monstruous feast, Where hungry warre had made himself a Guest: And comming late had eat up Guests and all, Who prov'd the feast to their owne funerall, &amp;c. Cupid's Cryer. Out of the Greeke Love is lost, nor can his Mother Her little fugitive discover: She seekes, she sighes, but no where spyes him; Love is lost; and thus shee cryes him. O yes! if any happy eye, This roaving wanton shall descry; Let the finder surely know Mine is the wagge; Tis I that owe The winged wand'rer; and that none May thinke his labour vainely gone, The glad descryer shall not misse, To tast the Nectar of a kisse From Venus lipps; But as for him That brings him to me, he shall swim In riper joyes: more shall be his (Venus assures him) than a kisse. But lest your eye discerning slide, These markes may be your judgements guide; His skin as with a fiery blushing High-colour'd is; His eyes still flushing With nimble flames, and though his mind Be ne're so curst, his Tongue is kind: For never were his words in ought Found the pure issue of his thought. The working Bees soft melting Gold, That which their waxen Mines enfold, Flow not so sweet as doe the Tones Of his tun'd accents; but if once His anger kindle, presently It boyles out into cruelty, And fraud: He makes poor mortalls hurts The objects of his cruell sports. With dainty curles his froward face Is crown'd about; But ô what place, What farthest nooke of lowest Hel! Feeles not the strength, the reaching spell Of his small hand? Yet not so small As 'tis powerfull therewithall. Though bare his skin, his mind he covers, And like a saucy Bird he hovers With wanton wing, now here, now there, 'Bout men and women, nor will spare Till at length he perching rest, In the closet of their brest. His weapon is a little Bow, Yet such a one as (Jove knows how) Ne're suffred, yet his little Arrow, Of Heavens high'st Archies to fall narrow. The Gold that on his Quiver smiles, Deceives mens feares with flattering wiles. But ô (too well my wounds can tell) With bitter shaft's 'tis sauc't too well. He is all cruell, cruell all; His Torch Imperious though but small Makes the Sunne (of flames the fire) Worse then Sun-burnt in his fire. Wheresoe're you chance to find him Ceaze him, bring him, (but first bind him) Pitty not him, but feare thy selfe Though thou see the crafty Elfe, Tell down his Silver-drops unto thee, They'r counterfeit, and will undoe thee. With baited smiles if he display His fawning cheeks, looke not that way. If he offer sugred kisses, Start, and say, The Serpent hisses. Draw him, drag him, though he pray Wooe, intreat, and crying say Prethee, sweet now let me go, Here's my Quiver Shafts and Bow, I'le give thee all, take all, take heed Lest his kindnesse make thee bleed. What e're it be Love offers, still presume That though it shines, 'tis fire and will consume. On Nanus mounted upon an Ant. High mounted on an Ant Nanus the tall Was thrown alas, and got a deadly fall. Under th'unruly Beasts proud feet he lies All torne; with much adoe yet e're he dyes, Hee straines these words; Base Envy, doe, laugh on. Thus did I fall, and thus fell Phaethon. Upon Venus putting on Mars his Armes. What? Mars his sword? faire Cytherea say, Why art thou arm'd so desperately to day? Mars thou hast beaten naked, and ô then What need'st thou put on arms against poore men? Upon the same. Pallas saw Venus arm'd, and streight she cry'd, Come if thou dar'st, thus, thus let us be try'd. Why foole! saies Venus, thus provok'st thou mee, That being nak't, thou know'st could conquer thee? Upon Bishop Andrews Picture before his Sermons. This reverend shadow cast that setting Sun, Whose glorious course through our Horrizon run, Left the dimme face of this dull Hemisphæare, All one great eye, all drown'd in one great Teare. Whose faire illustrious soule, led his free thought Through Learnings Universe, and (vainly) sought Room for her spatious selfe, untill at length Shee found the way home, with an holy strength Snatch't her self hence to Heaven: fill'd a bright place, 'Mongst those immortall fires, and on the face Of her great Maker fixt her flaming eye, There still to read true pure divinity. And now that grave aspect hath deign'd to shrinke Into this lesse appearance; If you thinke, 'Tis but a dead face, art doth here bequeath: Looke on the following leaves, and see him breath. Upon the Death of a Gentleman. Faithlesse and fond Mortality! Who will ever credit thee? Fond and faithlesse thing! that thus, In our best hopes beguilest us. What a reckoning hast thou made, Of the hopes in him we laid? For Life by volumes lengthened, A Line or two, to speake him dead. For the Laurell in his verse, The sullen Cypresse o're his Herse. For a silver-crowned Head, A durty pillow in Death's Bed. For so deare, so deep a trust, Sad requitall, thus much dust! Now though the blow that snatch him hence, Stopt the Mouth of Eloquence, Though shee be dumbe e're since his Death, Not us'd to speake but in his Breath, Yet if at least shee not denyes, The sad language of our eyes, Wee are contented: for then this Language none more fluent is. Nothing speakes our Griefe so well As to speak Nothing. Come then tell Thy mind in Teares who e're Thou be, That ow'st a Name to misery. Eyes are vocall, Teares have Tongues, And there be words not made with lungs; Sententious showers, ô let them fall, Their cadence is Rhetoricall. Here's a Theame will drinke th'expence, Of all thy watry Eloquence. Weepe then, onely be exprest Thus much, Hee's Dead, and weep the rest. Upon the Death of Mr. Herrys. A plant of noble stemme, forward and faire, As ever whisper'd to the Morning Aire, Thriv'd in these happy Grounds, the Earth's just pride, Whose rising Glories made such haste to hide His head in Cloudes, as if in him alone Impatient Nature had taught motion To start from time, and cheerfully to fly Before, and seize upon Maturity. Thus grew this gratious plant, in whose sweet shade, The Sunne himselfe oft wisht to sit, and made The Morning Muses perch like Birds, and sing Among his Branches: yea, and vow'd to bring His owne delicious Phœnix from the blest Arabia, there to build her Virgin nest, To hatch her selfe in; 'mongst his leaves the Day Fresh from the Rosie East rejoyc't to play. To them shee gave the first and fairest Beame That waited on her Birth: she gave to them The purest Pearles, that wept her evening Death. The balmy Zephirus got so sweet a Breath By often kissing them, and now begun Glad Time to ripen expectation. The timorous Maiden-Blossomes on each Bough, Peept forth from their first blushes: so that now A Thousand ruddy hopes smil'd in each Bud, And flatter'd every greedy eye that stood Fixt in Delight, as if already there Those rare fruits dangled, whence the Golden Yeare His crowne expected, when (ô Fate, ô Time That seldome lett'st a blushing youthfull Prime Hide his hot Beames in shade of silver Age; So rare is hoary vertue) the dire rage Of a mad storme these bloomy joyes all tore, Ravisht the Maiden Blossoms, and downe bore The trunke. Yet in this Ground his pretious Root Still lives, which when weake Time shall be pour'd out Into Eternity, and circular joyes Dance in an endlesse round, again shall rise The faire son of an ever-youthfull Spring, To be a shade for Angels while they sing, Meane while who e're thou art that passest here, O doe thou water it with one kind Teare. Upon the Death of the most desired Mr. Herrys. Death, what dost? ô hold thy Blow, What thou dost, thou dost not know. Death thou must not here be cruell, This is Natures choycest Jewell. This is hee in whose rare frame, Nature labour'd for a Name, And meant to leave his pretious feature, The patterne of a perfect Creature. Joy of Goodnesse, Love of Art, Vertue weares him next her heart. Him the Muses love to follow, Him they call their vice-Apollo. Apollo golden though thou bee, Th'art not fairer then is hee. Nor more lovely lift'st thy head, Blushing from thine Easterne Bed. The Glories of thy Youth ne're knew, Brighter hopes then he can shew. Why then should it e're be seen, That his should fade, while thine is Green? And wilt Thou, (ô cruell boast!) Put poore Nature to such cost? O 'twill undoe our common Mother, To be at charge of such another. What? thinke we to no other end, Gracious Heavens do use to send Earth her best perfection, But to vanish and be gone? Therefore onely give to day, To morrow to be snatcht away? I've seen indeed the hopefull bud, Of a ruddy Rose that stood Blushing, to behold the Ray Of the new-saluted Day; (His tender toppe not fully spread) The sweet dash of a shower now shead, Invited him no more to hide Within himselfe the purple pride Of his forward flower, when lo While he sweetly 'gan to show His swelling Gloryes, Auster spide him, Cruell Auster thither hy'd him, And with the rush of one rude blast, Sham'd not spitefully to wast All his leaves, so fresh, so sweet, And lay them trembling at his feet. I've seen the Mornings lovely Ray, Hover o're the new-borne Day, With rosie wings so richly Bright, As if he scorn'd to thinke of Night; When a ruddy storme whose scoule Made Heavens radiant face looke foule, Call'd for an untimely Night, To blot the newly blossom'd Light. But were the Roses blush so rare, Were the Mornings smile so faire As is he, nor cloud, nor wind But would be courteous, would be kind. Spare him Death, ô spare him then, Spare the sweetest among men. Let not pitty with her Teares, Keepe such distance from thine Eares. But ô thou wilt not, canst not spare, Haste hath never time to heare. Therefore if he needs must go, And the Fates will have it so, Softly may he be possest, Of his monumentall rest. Safe, thou darke home of the dead, Safe ô hide his loved head. For Pitties sake ô hide him quite, From his Mother Natures sight: Lest for Griefe his losse may move All her Births abortive prove. Another. [If ever Pitty were acquainted] If ever Pitty were acquainted With sterne Death, if e're he fainted, Or forgot the cruell vigour Of an Adamantine rigour, Here, ô here we should have knowne it, Here or no where hee'd have showne it. For hee whose pretious memory, Bathes in Teares of every eye: Hee to whom our sorrow brings, All the streames of all her springs: Was so rich in Grace and Nature, In all the gifts that blesse a Creature; The fresh hopes of his lovely Youth, Flourisht in so faire a growth; So sweet the Temple was, that shrin'd The Sacred sweetnesse of his mind; That could the Fates know to relent, Could they know what mercy meant; Or had ever learnt to beare, The soft tincture of a Teare: Teares would now have flow'd so deepe, As might have taught Griefe how to weepe. Now all their steely operation, Would quite have lost the cruell fashion. Sicknesse would have gladly been, Sick himselfe to have sav'd him: And his Feaver wish'd to prove, Burning onely in his Love. Him when wrath it selfe had seen, Wrath its selfe had lost his spleen. Grim Destruction here amaz'd, In stead of striking would have gaz'd. Even the Iron-pointed pen, That notes the Tragick Doomes of men Wet with teares still'd from the eyes, Of the flinty Destinies; Would have learn't a softer style, And have been asham'd to spoyle His lives sweet story, by the hast, Of a cruell stop ill plac't. In the darke volume of our fate, Whence each leafe of Life hath date, Where in sad particulars, The totall summe of Man appeares. And the short clause of mortall Breath, Bound in the period of Death, In all the Booke if any where Such a tearme as this, spare here Could have been found 'twould have been read, Writ in white Letters o're his head: Or close unto his name annext, The faire glosse of a fairer Text. In briefe, if any one were free, Hee was that one, and onely he. But he, alas! even hee is dead, And our hopes faire harvest spread In the dust. Pitty now spend All the teares that griefe can lend. Sad mortality may hide; In his ashes all her pride; With this inscription o're his head All hope of never dying, here lyes dead. His Epitaph. Passenger who e're thou art, Stay a while, and let thy Heart Take acquaintance of this stone, Before thou passest further on. This stone will tell thee that beneath, Is entomb'd the Crime of Death; The ripe endowments of whose mind Left his Yeares so much behind, That numbring of his vertues praise, Death lost the reckoning of his Dayes; And believing what they told, Imagin'd him exceeding old. In him perfection did set forth The strength of her united worth. Him his wisdomes pregnant growth Made so reverend, even in Youth, That in the Center of his brest (Sweet as is the Phænix nest) Every reconciled Grace Had their Generall meeting place. In him Goodnesse joy'd to see Learning learne Humility. The splendor of his Birth and Blood Was but the glosse of his owne Good. The flourish of his sober Youth Was the Pride of Naked Truth. In composure of his face, Liv'd a faire, but manly Grace. His mouth was Rhetoricks best mold, His tongue the Touchstone of her Gold. What word so e're his Breath kept warme, Was no word now but a charme: For all persuasive Graces thence Suck't their sweetest Influence. His vertue that within had root, Could not chuse but shine without. And th'heart-bred lustre of his worth, At each corner peeping forth, Pointed him out in all his wayes, Circled round in his owne Rayes: That to his sweetnesse, all mens eyes Were vow'd Loves flaming Sacrifice. Him while fresh and fragrant Time Cherisht in his Golden Prime; E're Hebe's hand had overlaid His smooth cheekes with a downy shade; The rush of Death's unruly wave, Swept him off into his Grave. Enough, now (if thou canst) passe on, For now (alas) not in this stone (Passenger who e're thou art) Is he entomb'd, but in thy Heart. An Epitaph. Upon Doctor Brooke. A Brooke whose streame so great, so good, Was lov'd, was honour'd, as a flood: Whose Bankes the Muses dwelt upon, More than their owne Helicon; Here at length, hath gladly found A quiet passage under ground; Meane while his loved bankes now dry, The Muses with their teares supply. Upon Ford's two Tragedies. Loves Sacrifice, and The Broken Heart. Thou cheat'st us Ford, mak'st one seeme two by Art. What is Loves Sacrifice, but The broken Heart. On a foule Morning, being then to take a journey. Where art thou Sol, while thus the blind fold Day Staggers out of the East, loses her way Stumbling on night? Rouze thee Illustrious Youth, And let no dull mists choake the Lights faire growth. Point here thy beames; ô glance on yonder flocks, And make their fleeces Golden as thy locks. Unfold thy faire front, and there shall appeare Full glory, flaming in her owne free spheare. Gladnesse shall cloath the Earth, we will instile The face of things, an universall smile. Say to the Sullen Morne, thou com'st to court her; And wilt command proud Zephirus to sport her With wanton gales: his balmy breath shall licke The tender drops which tremble on her cheeke; Which rarified, and in a gentle raine On those delicious bankes distill'd againe, Shall rise in a sweet Harvest, which discloses To every blushing Bed of new-borne Roses. Hee'l fan her bright locks, teaching them to flow, And friske in curl'd Mæanders; Hee will throw A fragrant Breath suckt from the spicy nest O'th' pretious Phœnix, warme upon her Breast. Hee with a dainty and soft hand will trim, And brush her Azure Mantle, which shall swim In silken Volumes; wheresoe're shee'l tread, Bright clouds like Golden fleeces shall be spread. Rise then (faire blew-ey'd Maid) rise and discover Thy silver brow, and meet thy Golden lover. See how hee runs, with what a hasty flight, Into thy bosome, bath'd with liquid Light. Fly, fly prophane fogs, farre hence fly away, Taint not the pure streames of the springing Day, With your dull influence; it is for you, To sit and scoule upon Nights heavy brow; Not on the fresh cheekes of the virgin Morne, Where nought but smiles, and ruddy joyes are worne. Fly then, and doe not thinke with her to stay; Let it suffice, shee'l weare no maske to day. Upon the faire Ethiopian sent to a Gentlewoman. Lo here the faire Chariclia! in whom strove So false a Fortune, and so true a Love. Now after all her toyles by Sea and Land, O may she but arrive at your white hand, Her hopes are crown'd, onely she feares that than, Shee shall appeare true Ethiopian. On Marriage. I would be married, but I'de have no Wife, I would be married to a single Life. To the Morning. Satisfaction for sleepe. What succour can I hope the Muse will send Whose drowsinesse hath wrong'd the Muses friend? What hope Aurora to propitiate thee, Unlesse the Muse sing my Apologie? O in that morning of my shame! when I Lay folded up in sleepes captivity, How at the sight did'st Thou draw back thine Eyes, Into thy modest veyle? how did'st thou rise Twice dy'd in thine own blushes, and did'st run To draw the Curtaines, and awake the Sun? Who rowzing his illustrious tresses came, And seeing the loath'd object, hid for shame His head in thy faire Bosome, and still hides Mee from his Patronage; I pray, he chides: And pointing to dull Morpheus, bids me take My owne Apollo, try if I can make His Lethe be my Helicon; and see If Morpheus have a Muse to wait on mee. Hence 'tis my humble fancie findes no wings, No nimble rapture starts to Heaven and brings Enthusiasticke flames, such as can give Marrow to my plumpe Genius, make it live Drest in the glorious madnesse of a Muse, Whose feet can walke the milky way, and chuse Her starry Throne; whose holy heats can warme The grave, and hold up an exalted arme To lift me from my lazy Urne, to climbe Upon the stooping shoulders of old Time, And trace Eternity—But all is dead, All these delicious hopes are buried In the deepe wrinckles of his angry brow, Where mercy cannot find them: but ô thou Bright Lady of the Morne, pitty doth lye So warme in thy soft Brest it cannot dye. Have mercy then, and when He next shall rise O meet the angry God, invade his Eyes, And stroake his radiant Cheekes; one timely kisse Will kill his anger, and revive my blisse. So to the treasure of thy pearly deaw, Thrice will I pay three Teares, to show how true My griefe is; so my wakefull lay shall knocke At th'Orientall Gates; and duly mocke The early Larkes shrill Orizons, to be An Anthem at the Dayes Nativitie. And the same rosie-finger'd hand of thine, That shuts Nights dying eyes, shall open mine. But thou, faint God of sleepe, forget that I Was ever known to be thy votary. No more my pillow shall thine Altar be, Nor will I offer any more to thee My selfe a melting sacrifice; I'me borne Againe a fresh Child of the Buxome Morne, Heire of the Suns first Beames; why threat'st thou so? Why dost thou shake thy leaden Scepter? goe, Bestow thy Poppy upon wakefull woe, Sicknesse, and sorrow, whose pale lidds ne're know Thy downie finger, dwell upon their Eyes, Shut in their Teares; Shut out their miseries. Upon the Powder day. How fit our well-rank'd Feasts do follow! All mischiefe comes after All-Hallow. Loves Horoscope. Love, brave Vertues younger Brother, Erst hath made my Heart a Mother, Shee consults the conscious Spheares, To calculate her young sons yeares. Shee askes if sad, or saving powers, Gave Omen to his infant howers, Shee askes each starre that then stood by, If poore Love shall live or dy. Ah my Heart, is that the way? Are these the Beames that rule thy Day? Thou know'st a Face in whose each looke, Beauty layes ope Loves Fortune-booke; On whose faire revolutions wait The obsequious motions of Loves fate; Ah my Heart, her eyes and shee, Have taught thee new Astrologie. How e're Loves native houres were set, What ever starry Synod met, 'Tis in the mercy of her eye, If poore Love shall live or dye. If those sharpe Rayes putting on Points of Death bid Love be gon, (Though the Heavens in counsell sate, To crowne an uncontrouled Fate, Though their best Aspects twin'd upon The kindest Constellation, Cast amorous glances on his Birth, And whisper'd the confederate Earth To pave his pathes with all the good That warms the Bed of youth and blood;) Love ha's no plea against her eye, Beauty frownes, and Love must dye. But if her milder influence move, And gild the hopes of humble Love: (Though heavens inauspicious eye Lay blacke on Loves Nativitie; Though every Diamond in Joves crowne Fixt his forehead to a frowne,) Her Eye a strong appeale can give, Beauty smiles and Love shall live. O if Love shall live, ô where, But in her Eye, or in her Eare, In her Brest, or in her Breath, Shall I hide poore Love from Death? For in the life ought else can give, Love shall dye, although he live. Or if Love shall dye, ô where, But in her Eye, or in her Eare, In her Breath, or in her Breast, Shall I Build his funerall Nest? While Love shall thus entombed lye, Love shall live, although he dye. Out of the Italian. A Song. [To thy Lover] To thy Lover, Deere, discover That sweet blush of thine that shameth (When those Roses It discloses) All the flowers that Nature nameth. In free Ayre, Flow thy Haire; That no more Summers best dresses, Bee beholden For their Golden Locks, to Phœbus flaming Tresses. O deliver Love his Quiver, From thy Eyes he shoots his Arrowes, Where Apollo Cannot follow: Featherd with his Mothers Sparrowes. O envy not (That we dye not) Those deere lips whose doore encloses All the Graces In their places, Brother Pearles, and sister Roses. From these treasures Of ripe pleasures One bright smile to cleere the weather. Earth and Heaven Thus made even, Both will be good friends together. The aire does wooe thee, Winds cling to thee; Might a word once flye from out thee, Storme and Thunder Would sit under, And keepe silence round about thee. But if Natures Common Creatures, So deare Glories dare not borrow: Yet thy Beauty Owes a Duty, To my loving, lingring, sorrow. When to end mee Death shall send mee All his Terrors to affright mee: Thine eyes Graces Gild their faces, And those Terrors shall delight mee. When my dying Life is flying, Those sweet Aires that often slew mee Shall revive mee, Or reprive mee, And to many Deaths renew mee. Out of the Italian. [Love now no fire hath left him] Love now no fire hath left him, We two betwixt us have divided it. Your Eyes the Light hath reft him, The heat commanding in my Heart doth sit. O! that poore Love be not for ever spoyled, Let my Heat to your Light be reconciled. So shall these flames, whose worth Now all obscured lyes, (Drest in those Beames) start forth And dance before your eyes. Or else partake my flames (I care not whither) And so in mutuall Names Of Love, burne both together. Out of the Italian. [Would any one the true cause find] Would any one the true cause find How Love came nak't, a Boy, and blind? 'Tis this; listning one day too long, To th'Syrens in my Mistris Song, The extasie of a delight So much o're-mastring all his might, To that one Sense, made all else thrall, And so he lost his Clothes, eyes, heart and all. [On the Frontispiece of Isaacsons Chronologie explained] Let hoary Time's vast Bowels be the Grave To what his Bowels birth and being gave; Let Nature die, (Phœnix-like) from death Revived Nature takes a second breath; If on Times right hand, sit faire Historie, If, from the seed of emptie Ruine, she Can raise so faire an Harvest: Let Her be Ne're so farre distant, yet Chronologie (Sharp-sighted as the Eagles eye, that can Out-stare the broad-beam'd Dayes Meridian) Will have a Perspicill to find her out, And, through the Night of error and dark doubt, Discerne the Dawne of Truth's eternall ray, As when the rosie Morne budds into Day. Now that Time's Empire might be amply fill'd, Babells bold Artists strive (below) to build Ruine a Temple; on whose fruitfull fall History reares her Pyramids more tall Than were th'Ægyptian (by the life these give, Th'Egyptian Pyramids themselves must live:) On these she lifts the World; and on their base Shewes the two termes and limits of Time's race: That, the Creation is; the Judgement, this; That, the World's Morning, this her Midnight is. An Epitaph Upon Mr. Ashton a conformable Citizen. The modest front of this small floore, Beleeve me, Reader, can say more Than many a braver Marble can, Here lyes a truly honest man. One whose Conscience was a thing, That troubled neither Church nor King. One of those few that in this Towne, Honour all Preachers, heare their owne. Sermons he heard, yet not so many As left no time to practise any. He heard them reverendly, and then His practice preach'd them o're agen. His Parlour-Sermons rather were Those to the Eye, then to the Eare. His prayers took their price and strength, Not from the lowdnesse, nor the length. He was a Protestant at home, Not onely in despight of Rome. He lov'd his Father; yet his zeale Tore not off his Mothers veile. To th'Church he did allow her Dresse, True Beauty, to true Holinesse. Peace, which he lov'd in Life, did lend Her hand to bring him to his end. When age and death call'd for the score, No surfets were to reckon for. Death tore not (therefore) but sans strife Gently untwin'd his thread of Life. What remaines then, but that Thou Write these lines, Reader, in thy Brow, And by his faire Examples light, Burne in thy Imitation bright. So while these Lines can but bequeath A Life perhaps unto his Death; His better Epitaph shall bee, His Life still kept alive in Thee. Out of Catullus. Come and let us live my Deare, Let us love and never feare, What the sowrest Fathers say: Brightest Sol that dyes to day Lives againe as blith to morrow; But if we darke sons of sorrow Set, ô then, how long a Night Shuts the Eyes of our short light! Then let amorous kisses dwell On our lips, begin and tell A thousand, and a Hundred score, An Hundred, and a Thousand more, Till another Thousand smother That, and that wipe off another. Thus at last when we have numbred Many a Thousand, many a Hundred, Wee'l confound the reckoning quite, And lose our selves in wild delight: While our joyes so multiply, As shall mocke the envious eye. Wishes. To his (supposed) Mistresse. Who ere she be, That not impossible she That shall command my heart and me; Where ere she lye, Lock't up from mortall Eye, In shady leaves of Destiny; Till that ripe Birth Of studied fate stand forth, And teach her faire steps to our Earth; Till that Divine Idæa, take a shrine Of Chrystall flesh, through which to shine; Meet you her my wishes, Bespeake her to my blisses, And be ye call'd my absent kisses. I wish her Beauty, That owes not all his Duty To gaudy Tire, or glistring shoo-ty. Something more than Taffata or Tissew can, Or rampant feather, or rich fan. More than the spoyle Of shop, or silkewormes Toyle, Or a bought blush, or a set smile. A face thats best By its owne beauty drest, And can alone command the rest. A face made up, Out of no other shop Than what natures white hand sets ope. A cheeke where Youth, And Blood, with Pen of Truth Write, what the Reader sweetly ru'th. A Cheeke where growes More than a Morning Rose: Which to no Boxe his being owes. Lipps, where all Day A lovers kisse may play, Yet carry nothing thence away. Lookes that oppresse Their richest Tires, but dresse And cloath their simplest Nakednesse. Eyes, that displaces The Neighbour Diamond, and out-faces That Sunshine, by their own sweet Graces. Tresses, that weare Jewells, but to declare How much themselves more pretious are. Whose native Ray, Can tame the wanton Day Of Gems, that in their bright shades play. Each Ruby there, Or Pearle that dare appeare, Be its own blush, be its own Teare. A well tam'd Heart, For whose more noble smart, Love may be long chusing a Dart. Eyes, that bestow Full quivers on loves Bow; Yet pay lesse Arrowes than they owe. Smiles, that can warme The blood, yet teach a charme, That Chastity shall take no harme. Blushes, that bin The burnish of no sin, Nor flames of ought too hot within. Joyes, that confesse, Vertue their Mistresse, And have no other head to dresse. Feares, fond and flight, As the coy Brides, when Night First does the longing Lover right. Teares, quickly fled, And vaine, as those are shed For a dying Maydenhead. Dayes, that need borrow, No part of their good Morrow, From a fore spent night of sorrow. Dayes, that in spight Of Darkenesse, by the Light Of a cleere mind are Day all Night. Nights, sweet as they, Made short by Lovers play, Yet long by th'absence of the Day. Life, that dares send A challenge to his end, And when it comes say Welcome Friend. Sydnæan showers Of sweet discourse, whose powers Can Crown old Winters head with flowers. Soft silken Hours, Open sunnes, shady Bowers; 'Bove all, Nothing within that lowers. What ere Delight Can make Dayes forehead bright, Or give Downe to the Wings of Night. In her whole frame, Have Nature all the Name, Art and ornament the shame. Her flattery, Picture and Poesy, Her counsell her owne vertue be. I wish, her store Of worth may leave her poore Of wishes; And I wish ? No more. Now if Time knowes That her whose radiant Browes Weave them a Garland of my vowes, Her whose just Bayes, My future hopes can raise, A trophie to her present praise; Her that dares be, What these Lines wish to see: I seeke no further, it is she. 'Tis she, and here Lo I uncloath and cleare, My wishes cloudy Character. May she enjoy it, Whose merit dare apply it, But modestly dares still deny it. Such worth as this is Shall fixe my flying wishes, And determine them to kisses. Let her full Glory, My fancyes, fly before ye, Be ye my fictions; But her story. To the Queen An Apologie for the length of the following Panegyrick. When you are Mistresse of the song, Mighty Queen, to thinke it long, Were treason 'gainst that Majesty Your vertue wears. Your modesty Yet thinks it so. But ev'n that too (Infinite, since part of You) New matter for our Muse supplies, And so allowes what it denies. Say then Dread Queen, how may we doe To mediate 'twixt your self and You? That so our sweetly temper'd song Nor be too short, nor seeme too long. Needs must your Noble prayses strength That made it long excuse the length. To the Queen, Upon her numerous Progenie, A Panegyrick. Britain! the mighty Oceans lovely bride! Now stretch thy self, fair Isle, and grow; spread wide Thy bosome, and make roome. Thou art opprest With thine own glories, and art strangely blest Beyond thy self: For (lo) the Gods, the Gods Come fast upon thee; and those glorious ods Swell thy full honours to a pitch so high As sits above thy best capacitie. Are they not ods? and glorious? that to thee Those mighty Genii throng, which well might be Each one an ages labour? that thy dayes Are gilded with the union of those rayes Whose each divided beam would be a Sunne To glad the sphere of any nation? Sure, if for these thou mean'st to find a seat Th'hast need, O Britain, to be truly Great. And so thou art; their presence makes thee so: They are thy greatnesse. Gods, where-e're they go, Bring their Heav'n with them: their great footsteps place An everlasting smile upon the face Of the glad earth they tread on. While with thee Those beames that ampliate mortalitie, And teach it to expatiate, and swell To majestie and fulnesse, deign to dwell, Thou by thy self maist sit, blest Isle, and see How thy great mother Nature dotes on thee. Thee therefore from the rest apart she hurl'd, And seem'd to make an Isle, but made a World. Time yet hath dropt few plumes since Hope turn'd Joy, And took into his armes the princely Boy, Whose birth last blest the bed of his sweet Mother, And bad us first salute our Prince a brother. The Prince and Duke of York. Bright Charles! thou sweet dawn of a glorious day! Centre of those thy Grandsires (shall I say, Henry and James? or, Mars and Phœbus rather? If this were Wisdomes God, that Wars stern father, 'Tis but the same is said: Henry and James Are Mars and Phœbus under diverse names.) O thou full mixture of those mighty souls Whose vast intelligences tun'd the Poles Of peace and war; thou, for whose manly brow Both lawrels twine into one wreath, and woo To be thy garland: see, sweet Prince, O see, Thou, and the lovely hopes that smile in thee, Art ta'n out and transcrib'd by thy great Mother: See, see thy reall shadow; see thy Brother, Thy little self in lesse: trace in these eyne The beams that dance in those full stars of thine. From the same snowy Alabaster rock Those hands and thine were hew'n; those cherries mock The corall of thy lips: Thou wert of all This well-wrought copie the fair principall. Lady Mary. Justly, great Nature, didst thou brag, and tell How ev'n th'hadst drawn that faithfull parallel, And matcht thy master-piece. O then go on, Make such another sweet comparison. Seest thou that Marie there? O teach her Mother To shew her to her self in such another. Fellow this wonder too; nor let her shine Alone; light such another star, and twine Their rosie beams, that so the morn for one Venus may have a Constellation. Lady Elizabeth. These words scarce waken'd Heaven, when (lo) our vows Sat crown'd upon the noble Infants brows. Th'art pair'd, sweet Princesse: In this well-writ book Read o're thy self; peruse each line, each look. And when th'hast summ'd up all those blooming blisses, Close up the book, and clasp it with thy kisses. So have I seen (to dresse their mistresse May) Two silken sister-flowers consult, and lay Their bashfull cheeks together: newly they Peep't from their buds, show'd like the garden's Eyes Scarce wak't: like was the crimson of their joyes; Like were the tears they wept, so like, that one Seem'd but the others kind reflexion. The new-borne Prince. And now 'twere time to say, Sweet Queen, no more. Fair source of Princes, is thy pretious store Not yet exhaust? O no. Heavens have no bound, But in their infinite and endlesse Round Embrace themselves. Our measure is not theirs; Nor may the pov'rtie of mans narrow prayers Span their immensitie. More Princes come: Rebellion, stand thou by; Mischief, make room: War, Bloud, and Death (Names all averse from Joy) Heare this, We have another bright-ey'd Boy: That word's a warrant, by whose vertue I Have full authority to bid you Dy. Dy, dy, foul misbegotten Monsters; Dy: Make haste away, or e'r the world's bright Eye Blush to a cloud of bloud. O farre from men Fly hence, and in your Hyperborean den Hide you for evermore, and murmure there Where none but Hell may heare, nor our soft aire Shrink at the hatefull sound. Mean while we bear High as the brow of Heaven, the noble noise And name of these our just and righteous joyes, Where Envie shall not reach them, nor those eares Whose tune keeps time to ought below the spheres. But thou, sweet supernumerary Starre, Shine forth; nor fear the threats of boyst'rous Warre. The face of things has therefore frown'd a while On purpose, that to thee and thy pure smile The world might ow an universall calm; While thou, fair Halcyon, on a sea of balm Shalt flote; where while thou layst thy lovely head, The angry billows shall but make thy bed: Storms, when they look on thee, shall straight relent; And Tempests, when they tast thy breath, repent To whispers soft as thine own slumbers be, Or souls of Virgins which shall sigh for thee. Shine then, sweet supernumerary Starre; Nor feare the boysterous names of Bloud and Warre: Thy Birthday is their Death's Nativitie; They've here no other businesse but to die. To the Queen. But stay; what glimpse was that? why blusht the day? Why ran the started aire trembling away? Who's this that comes circled in rayes that scorn Acquaintance with the Sun? what second morn At midday opes a presence which Heavens eye Stands off and points at? Is't some Deity Stept from her throne of starres, deignes to be seen? Is it some Deity? or i'st our Queen? 'Tis she, 'tis she: Her awfull beauties chase The Day's abashed glories, and in face Of noon wear their own Sunshine. O thou bright Mistresse of wonders! Cynthia's is the night; But thou at noon dost shine, and art all day (Nor does thy Sun deny't) our Cynthia. Illustrious sweetnesse! in thy faithfull wombe, That nest of Heroes, all our hopes find room. Thou art the Mother-Phenix, and thy brest Chast as that Virgin honour of the East, But much more fruitfull is; nor does, as she, Deny to mighty Love a Deitie. Then let the Eastern world brag and be proud Of one coy Phenix, while we have a brood, A brood of Phenixes; while we have Brother And Sister-Phenixes, and still the Mother. And may we long! Long mayst Thou live t'increase The house and family of Phenixes. Nor may the life that gives their eye-lids light E're prove the dismall morning of thy night: Ne're may a birth of thine be bought so dear To make his costly cradle of thy beer. O mayst thou thus make all the year thine own, And see such names of joy sit white upon The brow of every month! And when th'hast done, Mayst in a son of His find every son Repeated, and that son still in another, And so in each child often prove a Mother. Long mayst Thou, laden with such clusters, lean Upon thy Royall Elm, fair Vine! And when The Heav'ns will stay no longer, may thy glory And name dwell sweet in some Eternall story! Pardon, bright Excellence, an untun'd string, That in thy eares thus keeps a murmuring. O speake a lowly Muses pardon, speake Her pardon, or her sentence; onely breake Thy silence. Speake, and she shall take from thence Numbers, and sweetnesse, and an influence Confessing Thee. Or if too long I stay, O speake Thou, and my Pipe hath nought to say: For see Apollo all this while stands mute, Expecting by thy voice to tune his Lute. But Gods are gracious; and their Altars make Pretious the offrings that their Altars take. Give then this rurall wreath fire from thine eyes, This rurall wreath dares be thy Sacrifice. Upon two greene Apricockes sent to Cowley by Sir Crashaw. Take these, times tardy truants, sent by me, To be chastis'd (sweet friend) and chide by thee. Pale sons of our Pomona! whose wan cheekes Have spent the patience of expecting weekes, Yet are scarce ripe enough at best to show The redd, but of the blush to thee they ow. By thy comparrison they shall put on More summer in their shames reflection, Than ere the fruitfull Phœbus flaming kisses Kindled on their cold lips. O had my wishes And the deare merits of your Muse, their due, The yeare had found some fruit early as you; Ripe as those rich composures time computes Blossoms, but our blest tast confesses fruits. How does thy April-Autumne mocke these cold Progressions 'twixt whose termes poor time grows old? With thee alone he weares no beard, thy braine Gives him the morning worlds fresh gold againe. 'Twas only Paradice, 'tis onely thou, Whose fruit and blossoms both blesse the same bough. Proud in the patterne of thy pretious youth, Nature (methinks) might easily mend her growth. Could she in all her births but coppie thee, Into the publick yeares proficiencie, No fruit should have the face to smile on thee (Young master of the worlds maturitie) But such whose sun-borne beauties what they borrow Of beames to day, pay back againe to morrow, Nor need be double-gilt. How then must these, Poore fruites looke pale at thy Hesperides! Faine would I chide their slownesse, but in their Defects I draw mine owne dull character. Take them, and me in them acknowledging, How much my summer waites upon thy spring. CARMEN DEO NOSTRO, TE DECET HYMNUS SACRED POEMS, COLLECTED, CORRECTED, AUGMENTED, Most humbly Presented. TO MY LADY THE COUNTSSE OF DENBIGH BY Her most devoted Servant. R. C. IN hearty acknowledgment of his immortall obligation to her Goodnes &amp; Charity. CRASHAWE, THE ANAGRAMME. HE WAS CAR. Was Car then Crashawe; or Was Crashawe Car, Since both within one name combined are? Yes, Car's Crashawe, he Car; t'is love alone Which melts two harts, of both composing one. So Crashawe's still the same: so much desired By strongest witts; so honor'd so admired Car Was but He that enter'd as afriend With whom he shar'd his thoughtes, and did commend (While yet he liv'd) this worke; they lov'd each other: Sweete Crashawe was his friend; he Crashawes brother. So Car hath Title then; t'was his intent That what his riches pen'd, poore Car should print. Nor feares he checke praysing that happie one Who was belov'd by all; dispraysed by none. To witt, being pleas'd with all things, he pleas'd all. Nor would he give, nor take offence; befall What might; he would possesse himselfe: and live As deade (devoyde of interest) t'all might give Desease t'his well composed mynd; forestal'd With heavenly riches: which had wholy call'd His thoughtes from earth, to live above in'th aire A very bird of paradice. No care Had he of earthly trashe. What might suffice To fitt his soule to heavenly exercise. Sufficed him: and may we guesse his hart By what his lipps brings forth, his onely part Is God and godly thoughtes. Leaves doubt to none But that to whom one God is all; all's one. What he might eate or weare he tooke no thought. His needfull foode he rather found then sought. He seekes no downes, no sheetes, his bed's still made If he can find, a chaire or stoole, he's layd, When day peepes in, he quitts his restlesse rest. And still, poore soule, before he's up he's dres't. Thus dying did he live, yet lived to dye In th-virgines lappe, to whom he did applye His virgine thoughtes and words, and thence was styld By foes, the chaplaine of the virgine myld While yet he lived without: His modestie Imparted this to some, and they to me. Live happie then, deare soule; injoy the rest Eternally by paynes thou purchacedest, While Car must live in care, who was thy friend Nor cares he how he live, so in the end, He may injoy his dearest Lord and thee; And sitt and singe more skilfull songs eternally. AN EPIGRAMME Upon the pictures in the following Poemes which the Authour first made with his owne hand, admirably well, as may be seene in his Manuscript dedicated to the right Honorable Lady the L. Denbigh. Twixt pen and pensill rose a holy strife Which might draw vertue better to the life. Best witts gave votes to that: but painters swore They never saw peeces so sweete before As thes: fruites of pure nature; where no art Did lead the untaught pensill, nor had part In th'-worke. The hand growne bold, with witt will needes contest. Doth it prevayle? ah wo: say each is best. This to the eare speakes wonders; that will trye To speake the same, yet lowder, to the eye. Both their aymes are holy, both conspire To wound, to burne the hart with heavenly fire. This then's the Doome, to doe both parties right: This, to the eare speakes best; that, to the sight. THOMAS CAR. NON VI. 'Tis not the work of force but skill To find the way into man's will. 'Tis love alone can hearts unlock. Who knowes the Word, he needs not knock. TO THE Noblest &amp; best of Ladyes, the Countesse of Denbigh. Perswading her to Resolution in Religion, &amp; to render her selfe without further delay into the Communion of the Catholick Church. What heav'n-intreated Heart is This? Stands trembling at the gate of blisse; Holds fast the door, yet dares not venture Fairly to open it, and enter. Whose Definition is à doubt Twixt life &amp; death, twixt in &amp; out. Say, lingring fair! why comes the birth Of your brave soul so slowly forth? Plead your pretences (o you strong In weaknes!) why you choose so long In labor of your selfe to ly, Nor daring quite to live nor dy? Ah linger not, lov'd soul! à slow And late consent was a long no, Who grants at last, long time tryd And did his best to have deny'd, What magick bolts, what mystick Barres Maintain the will in these strange warres! What fatall, yet fantastick, bands Keep The free Heart from it's own hands! So when the year takes cold, we see Poor waters their owne prisoners be. Fetter'd, &amp; lockt up fast they ly In a sad selfe-captivity. The' astonisht nymphs their flood's strange fate deplore, To see themselves their own severer shore. Thou that alone canst thaw this cold, And fetch the heart from it's strong Hold; Allmighty Love! end this long warr, And of a meteor make a starr. O fix this fair Indefinite. And 'mongst thy shafts of soveraign light Choose out that sure decisive dart Which has the Key of this close heart, Knowes all the corners of't, &amp; can controul The self-shutt cabinet of an unsearcht soul. O let it be at last, love's houre. Raise this tall Trophee of thy Powre; Come once the conquering way; not to confute But kill this rebell-word, Irresolute That so, in spite of all this peevish strength Of weaknes, she may write Resolv'd at Length, Unfold at length, unfold fair flowre And use the season of love's showre, Meet his well-meaning Wounds, wise heart! And hast to drink the wholsome dart. That healing shaft, which heavn till now Hath in love's quiver hid for you. O Dart of love! arrow of light! O happy you, if it hitt right, It must not fall in vain, it must Not mark the dry regardles dust. Fair one, it is your fate; and brings Æternall worlds upon it's wings. Meet it with wide-spread armes; &amp; see It's seat your soul's just center be. Disband dull feares; give faith the day. To save your life, kill your delay It is love's seege; and sure to be Your triumph, though his victory. 'Tis cowardise that keeps this feild And want of courage not to yeild. Yeild then, ô yeild. that love may win The Fort at last, and let life in. Yeild quickly. Lest perhaps you prove Death's prey, before the prize of love. This Fort of your fair selfe, if't be not won, He is repulst indeed; But you'are vndone. TO THE NAME ABOVE EVERY NAME, THE NAME OF JESUS A HYMN. I sing the Name which None can say But touch't with An interiour Ray: The Name of our New Peace; our Good: Our Blisse: &amp; Supernaturall Blood: The Name of All our Lives &amp; Loves. Hearken, And Help, ye holy Doves! The high-born Brood of Day; you bright Candidates of blissefull Light, The Heirs Elect of Love; whose Names belong Unto The everlasting life of Song; All ye wise Soules, who in the wealthy Brest Of This unbounded Name build your warm Nest. Awake, My glory. Soul, (if such thou be, And That fair Word at all referr to Thee) Awake &amp; sing And be All Wing; Bring hither thy whole Self; &amp; let me see What of thy Parent Heavn yet speakes in thee. O thou art Poore Of noble Powres, I see, And full of nothing else but empty Me, Narrow, &amp; low, &amp; infinitely lesse Then this Great mornings mighty Busynes. One little World or two (Alas) will never doe. We must have store. Goe, Soul, out of thy Self, &amp; seek for More. Goe &amp; request Great Nature for the Key of her huge Chest Of Heavns, the self involving Sett of Sphears (Which dull mortality more Feeles then heares) Then rouse the nest Of nimble Art, &amp; traverse round The Aiery Shop of soul-appeasing Sound: And beat a summons in the Same All-soveraign Name To warn each severall kind And shape of sweetnes, Be they such As sigh with supple wind Or answer Artfull Touch, That they convene &amp; come away To wait at the love-crowned Doores of This Illustrious Day. Shall we dare This, my Soul? we'l doe't and bring No Other note for't, but the Name we sing. Wake Lute &amp; Harp And every sweet-lipp't Thing That talkes with tunefull string; Start into life, And leap with me Into a hasty Fitt-tun'd Harmony. Nor must you think it much T'obey my bolder touch; I have Authority in Love's name to take you And to the worke of Love this morning wake you; Wake; In the Name Of Him who never sleeps, All Things that Are, Or, what's the same, Are Musicall; Answer my Call And come along; Help me to meditate mine Immortall Song. Come, ye soft ministers of sweet sad mirth, Bring All your houshold stuffe of Heavn on earth; O you, my Soul's most certain Wings, Complaining Pipes, &amp; prattling Strings, Bring All the store Of Sweets you have; And murmur that you have no more. Come, nére to part, Nature &amp; art! Come; &amp; come strong, To the conspiracy of our Spatious song. Bring All the Powres of Praise Your Provinces of well-united Worlds can raise; Bring All your Lutes &amp; Harps of Heavn &amp; Earth; What ére cooperates to The common mirthe Vessells of vocall Joyes, Or You, more noble Architects of Intellectuall Noise, Cymballs of Heav'n, or Humane sphears, Solliciters of Soules or Eares; And when you'are come, with All That you can bring or we can call; O may you fix For ever here, &amp; mix Your selves into the long And everlasting series of a deathlesse Song; Mix All your many Worlds, Above, And loose them into One of Love. Chear thee my Heart! For Thou too hast thy Part And Place in the Great Throng Of This unbounded All-imbracing Song. Powres of my Soul, be Proud! And speake lowd To All the dear-bought Nations This Redeeming Name, And in the wealth of one Rich Word proclaim New Similes to Nature. May it be no wrong Blest Heavns, to you, &amp; your Superiour song, That we, dark Sons of Dust &amp; Sorrow, A while Dare borrow The Name of Your Dilights &amp; our Desires, And fitt it to so farr inferior Lyres. Our Murmurs have their Musick too, Ye mighty Orbes, as well as you, Nor yeilds the noblest Nest Of warbling Seraphim to the eares of Love, A choicer Lesson then the joyfull Brest Of a poor panting Turtle-Dove. And we, low Wormes have leave to doe The Same bright Busynes (ye Third Heavens) with you. Gentle Spirits, doe not complain. We will have care To keep it fair, And send it back to you again. Come, lovely Name! Appeare from forth the Bright Regions of peacefull Light, Look from thine own Illustrious Home, Fair King of Names, &amp; come. Leave All thy native Glories in their Georgeous Nest, And give thy Self a while The gracious Guest Of humble Soules, that seek to find The hidden Sweets Which man's heart meets When Thou art Master of the Mind. Come, lovely Name; life of our hope! Lo we hold our Hearts wide ope! Unlock thy Cabinet of Day Dearest Sweet, &amp; come away. Lo how the thirsty Lands Gasp for thy Golden Showres! with longstretch't Hands. Lo how the laboring Earth That hopes to be All Heaven by Thee, Leapes at thy Birth. The' attending World, to wait thy Rise, First turn'd to eyes; And then, not knowing what to doe; Turn'd Them to Teares, &amp; spent Them too. Come Royall Name, &amp; pay the expence Of All this Pretious Patience. O come away And kill the Death of This Delay. O see, so many Worlds of barren yeares Melted &amp; measur'd out in Seas of Teares. O see, The Weary liddes of wakefull Hope (Love's Eastern windowes) All wide ope With Curtains drawn, To catch The Day-break of Thy Dawn. O dawn, at last, long look't for Day! Take thine own wings, &amp; come away. Lo, where Aloft it comes! It comes, Among The Conduct of Adoring Spirits, that throng Like diligent Bees, And swarm about it. O they are wise; And know what Sweetes are suck't from out it. It is the Hive, By which they thrive, Where All their Hoard of Hony lyes. Lo where it comes, upon The snowy Dove's Soft Back; And brings a Bosom big with Loves. Welcome to our dark world, Thou Womb of Day! Unfold thy fair Conceptions; And display The Birth of our Bright Joyes. O thou compacted Body of Blessings: spirit of Soules extracted! O dissipate thy spicy Powres (Clowd of condensed sweets) &amp; break upon us In balmy showrs; O fill our senses, And take from us All force of so Prophane a Fallacy To think ought sweet but that which smells of Thee. Fair, flowry Name; In none but Thee And Thy Nectareall Fragrancy, Hourly there meetes An universall Synod of All sweets; By whom it is defined Thus That no Perfume For ever shall presume To passe for Odoriferous, But such alone whose sacred Pedigree Can prove it Self some kin (sweet name) to Thee. Sweet Name, in Thy each Syllable A Thousand Blest Arabias dwell; A Thousand Hills of Frankincense; Mountains of myrrh, &amp; Beds of species, And ten Thousand Paradises, The soul that tasts thee takes from thence How many unknown Worlds there are Of Comforts, which Thou hast in keeping! How many Thousand Mercyes there In Pitty's soft lap ly a sleeping! Happy he who has the art To awake them, And to take them Home, &amp; lodge them in his Heart. O that it were as it was wont to be! When thy old Freinds of Fire, All full of Thee, Fought against Frowns with smiles; gave Glorious chase To Persecutions; And against the Face Of Death &amp; feircest Dangers, durst with Brave And sober pace march on to meet A Grave. On their Bold Brests about the world they bore thee And to the Teeth of Hell stood up to teach thee, In Center of their inmost Soules they wore thee, Where Rackes &amp; Torments striv'd, in vain, to reach thee. Little, alas, thought They Who tore the Fair Brests of thy Freinds, Their Fury but made way For Thee; And serv'd them in Thy glorious ends. What did Their weapons but with wider pores Inlarge thy flaming-brested Lovers More freely to transpire That impatient Fire The Heart that hides Thee hardly covers. What did their Weapons but sett wide the Doores For Thee: Fair, purple Doores, of love's devising; The Ruby windowes which inrich't the East Of Thy so oft repeated Rising. Each wound of Theirs was Thy new Morning; And reinthron'd thee in thy Rosy Nest, With blush of thine own Blood thy day adorning, It was the witt of love óreflowd the Bounds Of Wrath, &amp; made thee way through All Those wounds. Wellcome dear, All-Adored Name! For sure there is no Knee That knowes not Thee. Or if there be such sonns of shame, Alas what will they doe When stubborn Rocks shall bow And Hills hang down their Heavn-saluting Heads To seek for humble Beds Of Dust, where in the Bashfull shades of night Next to their own low Nothing they may ly, And couch before the dazeling light of thy dread majesty. They that by Love's mild Dictate now Will not adore thee, Shall Then with Just Confusion, bow And break before thee. IN THE HOLY NATIVITY OF OUR LORD GOD A HYMN SUNG AS BY THE SHEPHEARDS. THE HYMN. CHORUS. Come we shepheards whose blest Sight Hath mett love's Noon in Nature's night; Come lift we up our loftyer Song And wake the Sun that lyes too long. To all our world of well-stoln joy He slept; and dream't of no such thing. While we found out Heavn's fairer ey And Kis't the Cradle of our King. Tell him He rises now, too late To show us ought worth looking at. Tell him we now can show Him more Then He e're show'd to mortall Sight; Then he Himselfe e're saw before; Which to be seen needes not His light. Tell him, Tityrus, where th'hast been Tell him, Thyrsis, what th-hast seen. Tityrus. Gloomy night embrac't the Place Where The Noble Infant lay. The Babe look't up &amp; shew'd his Face; In spite of Darknes, it was Day. It was Thy day, Sweet! &amp; did rise Not from the East, but from thine Eyes. Chorus It was Thy day, Sweet Thyrs. Winter chidde aloud; &amp; sent The angry North to wage his warres. The North forgott his feirce Intent; And left perfumes in stead of scarres. By those sweet eyes' persuasive powrs Where he mean't frost, he scatter'd flowrs. Chorus By those sweet eyes' Both. We saw thee in thy baulmy Nest, Young dawn of our æternall Day! We saw thine eyes break from their Easte And chase the trembling shades away. We saw thee; &amp; we blest the sight, We saw thee by thine own sweet light. Tity. Poor World (said I.) what wilt thou doe To entertain this starry Stranger? Is this the best thou canst bestow? A cold, and not too cleanly, manger? Contend, the powres of heav'n &amp; earth. To fitt à bed for this huge birthe. Cho. Contend the powers Thyr. Proud world, said I; cease your contest And let the Mighty Babe alone. The Phænix builds the Phænix' nest. Lov's architecture is his own. The Babe whose birth embraves this morn, Made his own bed e're he was born. Cho. The Babe whose. Tit. I saw the curl'd drops, soft &amp; slow, Come hovering o're the place's head; Offring their whitest sheets of snow To furnish the fair Infant's bed: Forbear, said I; be not too bold. Your fleece is white But t'is too cold. Cho. Forbear, sayd I Thyr. I saw the obsequious Seraphims Their rosy fleece of fire bestow. For well they now can spare their wing. Since Heavn it self lyes here below. Well done, said I: but are you sure Your down so warm, will passe for pure? Cho. Well done sayd I Tit. No no, your King's not yet to seeke Where to repose his Royall Head See see, how soon his new-bloom'd Cheek Twixt's mother's brests is gone to bed. Sweet choise, said we! no way but so Not to ly cold, yet slep in snow. Cho. Sweet choise, said we. Both. We saw thee in thy baulmy nest, Bright dawn of our æternall Day! We saw thine eyes break from thir East And chase the trembling shades away. We saw thee: &amp; we blest the sight. We saw thee, by thine own sweet light. Cho. We saw thee, &amp;c. FULL CHORUS. Wellcome, all Wonders in one sight! Æternity shutt in a span. Sommer in Winter. Day in Night. Heaven in earth, &amp; God in Man. Great little one! whose all-embracing birth Lifts earth to heaven, stoopes heav'n to earth. Wellcome. Though nor to gold nor silk, To more then Cæsar's birth right is; Two sister-seas of Virgin-Milk, With many a rarely-temper'd kisse That breathes at once both Maid &amp; Mother, Warmes in the one, cooles in the other. Welcome, though not to those gay flyes Guilded ith' Beames of earthly kings; Slippery soules in smiling eyes; But to poor Shepheards, home-spun things: Whose Wealth's their flock; whose witt, to be Well read in their simplicity. Yet when young April's husband showrs Shall blesse the fruitfull Maia's bed We'l bring the First-born of her flowrs To kisse thy Feet &amp; crown thy Head. To thee, dread lamb! whose love must keep The shepheards, more then they the sheep. To Thee, meek Majesty! soft King Of simple Graces &amp; sweet Loves. Each of us his lamb will bring Each his pair of sylver Doves; Till burnt at last in fire of Thy fair eyes, Our selves become our own best Sacrifice. NEW YEAR'S DAY. Rise, thou best &amp; brightest morning! Rosy with a double Red; With thine own blush thy cheeks adorning And the dear drops this day were shed. All the purple pride that laces The crimson curtains of thy bed, Guilds thee not with so sweet graces Nor setts thee in so rich a red. Of all the fair-cheek't flowrs that fill thee None so fair thy bosom strowes, As this modest maiden lilly Our sins have sham'd into a rose. Bid thy golden God, the Sun, Burnisht in his best beames rise, Put all his red-ey'd Rubies on; These Rubies shall putt out their eyes. Let him make poor the purple east, Search what the world's close cabinets keep, Rob the rich births of each bright nest That flaming in their fair beds sleep, Let him embrave his own bright tresses With a new morning made of gemmes; And wear, in those his wealthy dresses, Another Day of Diadems. When he hath done all he may To make himselfe rich in his rise, All will be darknes to the Day That breakes from one of these bright eyes. And soon this sweet truth shall appear Dear Babe, ere many dayes be done, The morn shall come to meet thee here, And leave her own neglected Sun. Here are Beautyes shall bereave him Of all his eastern Paramours. His Persian Lovers all shall leave him, And swear faith to thy sweeter Powres. IN THE GLORIOUS EPIPHANIE OF OUR LORD GOD, A HYMN. SUNG AS BY THE THREE KINGS (1. KINGE.) Bright Babe! Whose awfull beautyes make The morn incurr a sweet mistake; (2.) For whom the'officious heavns devise To disinheritt the sun's rise, (3.) Delicately to displace The Day, &amp; plant it fairer in thy face; (1.) O thou born King of loves, (2.) Of lights, (3.) Of joyes! (Cho.) Look up, sweet Babe, look up &amp; see For love of Thee Thus farr from home The East is come To seek her self in thy sweet Eyes. (1.) We, who strangely went astray, Lost in a bright Meridian night, (2.) A Darkenes made of too much day, (3.) Becken'd from farr By thy fair starr, Lo at last have found our way. (Cho.) To Thee, thou Day of night! thou east of west! Lo we at last have found the way. To thee, the world's great universal east, The Generall &amp; indifferent Day. (1.) All-circling point. All centring sphear. The world's one, round, Æternall year. (2.) Whose full &amp; all-unwrinkled face Nor sinks nor swells with time or place; (3.) But every where &amp; every while Is One Consistent solid smile; (1.) Not vext &amp; tost (2.) 'Twixt spring &amp; frost, (3.) Nor by alternate shredds of light Sordidly shifting hands with shades &amp; night. (Cho.) O little all! in thy embrace The world lyes warm, &amp; likes his place. Nor does his full Globe fail to be Kist on Both his cheeks by Thee. Time is too narrow for thy Year Nor makes the whole World thy half-sphear. (1.) To Thee, to Thee From him we flee (2.) From Him, whom by a more illustrious ly, The blindnes of the world did call the eye; (3.) To Him, who by These mortall clouds hast made Thy self our sun, though thine own shade. (1.) Farewell, the world's false light. Farewell, the white Ægypt! a long farewell to thee Bright Idol; black Idolatry. The dire face of inferior Darknes, kis't And courted in the pompus mask of a more specious mist. (2.) Farewell, farewell The proud &amp; misplac't gates of hell, Pertch't, in the morning's way And double-guilded as the doores of Day. The deep hypocrisy of Death &amp; Night More desperately dark, Because more bright. (3.) Welcome, the world's sure Way! Heavn's wholsom ray. (Cho.) Wellcome to us; and we (Sweet) to our selves, in Thee. (1.) The deathles Heir of all thy Father's day! (2.) Decently Born. Embosom'd in a much more Rosy Morn, The Blushes of thy All-unblemish't mother. (3.) No more that other Aurora shall sett ope Her ruby casements, or hereafter hope From mortall eyes To meet Religious welcomes at her rise. (Cho.) We (Pretious ones!) in you have won A gentler Morn, a juster sun. (1.) His superficiall Beames sun-burn't our skin; (2.) But left within (3.) The night &amp; winter still of death &amp; sin. (Cho.) Thy softer yet more certaine Darts Spare our eyes, but peirce our Harts. (1.) Therfore with His proud persian spoiles (2.) We court thy more concerning smiles. (3.) Therfore with his Disgrace We guild the humble cheek of this chast place; (Cho.) And at thy Feet powr forth his Face. (1.) The doating nations now no more Shall any day but Thine adore. (2.) Nor (much lesse) shall they leave these eyes For cheap Ægyptian Deityes. (3.) In whatsoe're more Sacred shape Of Ram, He-goat, or reverend ape, Those beauteous ravishers opprest so sore The too-hard-tempted nations. (1.) Never more By wanton heyfer shall be worn (2.) A Garland, or a guilded horn. The altar-stall'd ox, fatt Osyris now With his fair sister cow, (3.) Shall kick the clouds no more; But lean &amp; tame, (Cho.) See his horn'd face, &amp; dy for shame. And Mithra now shall be no name. (1.) No longer shall the immodest lust Of Adulterous Godles dust (2.) Fly in the face of heav'n; As if it were The poor world's Fault that he is fair. (3.) Nor with perverse loves &amp; Religious Rapes Revenge thy Bountyes in their beauteous shapes; And punish Best Things worst; Because they stood Guilty of being much for them too Good. (1.) Proud sons of death! that durst compell Heav'n it self to find them hell; (2.) And by strange witt of madnes wrest From this world's East the other's West. (3.) All-Idolizing wormes! that thus could crowd And urge Their sun into thy cloud; Forcing his sometimes eclips'd face to be A long deliquium to the light of thee. (Cho.) Alas with how much heavyer shade The shamefac't lamp hung down his head For that one eclipse he made Then all those he suffered! (1.) For this he look't so bigg; &amp; every morn With a red face confes't this scorn. Or hiding his vex't cheeks in a hir'd mist Kept them from being so unkindly kis't. (2.) It was for this the day did rise So oft with blubber'd eyes. For this the evening wept; and we ne're knew But call'd it deaw. (3.) This dayly wrong Silenc't the morning-sons, &amp; damp't their song; (Cho.) Nor was't our deafnes, but our sins, that thus Long made th'Harmonious orbes all mute to us. (1.) Time has a day in store When this so proudly poor And self-oppressed spark, that has so long By the love-sick world bin made Not so much their sun as Shade, Weary of this Glorious wrong From them &amp; from himself shall flee For shelter to the shadow of thy Tree; (Cho.) Proud to have gain'd this pretious losse And chang'd his false crown for thy Crosse. (2.) That dark Day's clear doom shall define Whose is the Master Fire, which sun should shine. That sable judgment-seat shall by new lawes Decide &amp; settle the Great cause Of controverted light, (Cho.) And natur's wrongs rejoyce to doe thee Right. (3.) That forfeiture of noon to night shall pay All the idolatrous thefts done by this night of day; And the Great Penitent presse his own pale lipps With an elaborate love-eclipse To which the low world's lawes Shall lend no cause (Cho.) Save those domestick which he borrowes From our sins &amp; his own sorrowes. (1.) Three sad hours' sackcloth then shall show to us His penance, as our fault, conspicuous. (2.) And he more needfully &amp; nobly prove The nation's terror now then erst their love. (3.) Their hated loves changd into wholsom feares, (Cho.) The shutting of his eye shall open Theirs. (1.) As by a fair-ey'd fallacy of day Miss-ledde before they lost their way, So shall they, by the seasonable fright Of an unseasonable night, Loosing it once again, stumble'on true Light. (2.) And as before his too-bright eye Was Their more blind idolatry, So his officious blindines now shall be Their black, but faithfull perspective of thee; (3.) His new prodigious night, Their new &amp; admirable light; The supernaturall Dawn of Thy pure day. While wondring they (The happy converts now of him Whom they compell'd before to be their sin) Shall henceforth see To kisse him only as their rod Whom they so long courted as God, (Cho.) And their best use of him they worship't be To learn, of Him at lest, to worship Thee. (1.) It was their Weaknes woo'd his beauty; But it shall be Their wisdome now, as well as duty, To'injoy his Blott; &amp; as a large black letter Use it to spell Thy beautyes better; And make the night it self their torch to thee. (2.) By the oblique ambush of this close night Couch't in that conscious shade The right-ey'd Areopagite Shall with a vigorous guesse invade And catche thy quick reflex; and sharply see On this dark Ground To descant Thee. (3.) O prize of the rich Spirit! with that feirce chase Of this strong soul, shall he Leap at thy lofty Face, And seize the swift Flash, in rebound From this obsequious cloud; Once call'd a sun; Till dearly thus undone, (Cho.) Till thus triumphantly tam'd (o ye two Twinne Sunnes!) &amp; taught now to negotiate you. (1.) Thus shall that reverend child of light, (2.) By being scholler first of that new night, Come forth Great master of the mystick day; (3.) And teach obscure Mankind a more close way By the frugall negative light Of a most wise &amp; well-abused Night To read more legible thine originall Ray, (Cho.) And make our Darknes serve Thy day; Maintaining t'wixt thy world &amp; ours A commerce of contrary powres, A mutuall trade 'Twixt sun &amp; Shade, By confederat Black &amp; White Borrowing day &amp; lending night. (1.) Thus we, who when with all the noble powres That (at thy cost) are call'd, not vainly, ours We vow to make brave way Upwards, &amp; presse on for, the pure intelligentiall Prey; (2.) At lest to play The amorous Spyes And peep &amp; proffer at thy sparkling Throne; (3.) In stead of bringing in the blissfull Prize And fastening on Thine eyes, Forfeit our own And nothing gain But more Ambitious losse, at lest of brain; (Cho.) Now by abased liddes shall learn to be Eagles; and shutt our eyes that we may see. The Close. Therfore to Thee &amp; thine Auspitious ray (Dread sweet!) lo thus At lest by us, The delegated Eye of Day Does first his Scepter, then Himself in solemne Tribute pay. Thus he undresses His sacred unshorn treses; At thy adored Feet, thus, he layes down (1.) His gorgeous tire Of flame &amp; fire, (2.) His glittering Robe, (3.) his sparkling Crown, (1.) His Gold, (2.) his Mirrh, (3.) his Frankincence, (Cho.) To which He now has no pretence. For being show'd by this day's light, how farr He is from sun enough to make Thy starr, His best ambition now, is but to be Somthing a brighter Shadow (sweet) of thee. Or on heavn's azure forhead high to stand Thy golden index; with a duteous Hand Pointing us Home to our own sun The world's &amp; his Hyperion. TO THE QUEEN'S MAJESTY. Madame. 'Mongst those long rowes of crownes that guild your race, These Royall sages sue for decent place. The day-break of the nations; their first ray; When the Dark World dawn'd into Christian Day. And smil'd i'th' Babe's bright face, the purpling Bud And Rosy dawn of the right Royall blood; Fair first-fruits of the Lamb. Sure Kings in this; They took a kingdom while they gave a kisse. But the world's Homage, scarse in These well blown, We read in you (Rare Queen) ripe &amp; full-grown. For from this day's rich seed of Diadems Does rise a radiant croppe of Royalle stemms, A Golden harvest of crown'd heads, that meet And crowd for kisses from the Lamb's white feet. In this Illustrious throng, your lofty floud Swells high, fair Confluence of all highborn Bloud! With your bright head whose groves of scepters bend Their wealthy tops; &amp; for these feet contend. So swore the Lamb's dread fire. And so we see't. Crownes, &amp; the Heads they kisse, must court these Feet. Fix here, fair Majesty! May your Heart ne're misse To reap new Crownes &amp; Kingdoms from that kisse. Nor may we misse the joy to meet in you The aged honors of this day still new. May the great time, in you, still greater be While all the Year is your Epiphany, While your each day's devotion duly brings Three Kingdomes to supply this day's three Kings.

The sun saw That; And would have seen no more The center shook. Her uselesse veil th'inglorious Temple tore. The Antiphona. O strange mysterious strife Of open Death &amp; hidden Life! When on the crosse my king did bleed, Life seem'd to dy, Death dy'd indeed. The Versicle. Lo we adore thee Dread Lamb! and fall thus low before thee The Responsor. 'Cause by the covenant of thy Crosse Thou 'hast sav'd at once the whole world's losse. EVENSONG. The Versicle. Lord, by thy sweet &amp; saving Sign The Responsor. Defend us from our foes &amp; thine. V. Thou shalt open. R. And my mouth. V. O God make speed. R. O Lord make hast. V. Glory be to. R. As it was in the. THE HYMN. But there were Rocks would not relent at This. Lo, for their own hearts, they rend his. Their deadly hate lives still; &amp; hath A wild reserve of wanton wrath; Superfluous Spear! But there's à Heart stands by Will look no wounds be lost, no deaths shall dy. Gather now thy Greif's ripe Fruit. Great mother-maid! Then sitt thee down, &amp; sing thine Ev'nsong in the sad Tree's shade. The Antiphona. O sad, sweet Tree! Wofull &amp; joyfull we Both weep &amp; sing in shade of thee. When the dear Nailes did lock And graft into thy gracious Stock The hope; the health, The worth, the wealth Of all the ransom'd World, thou hadst the power (In that propitious Hour) To poise each pretious limb, And prove how light the World was, when it weighd with Him. Wide maist thou spred Thine Armes; And with thy bright &amp; blisfull head O'relook all Libanus. Thy lofty crown The king himself is; Thou his humble Throne. Where yeilding &amp; yet conquering he Prov'd a new path of patient Victory. When wondring death by death was slain, And our Captivity his Captive ta'ne. The Versicle. Lo we adore thee Dread Lamb! &amp; bow thus low before thee; The Responsor. 'Cause by the convenant of thy Crosse. Thou'hast sav'd the world from certain losse. COMPLINE. The Versicle. Lord by thy sweet &amp; saving Sign, The Responsor. Defend us from our foes &amp; thine. V. Thou shalt open. R. And my mouth. V. O God make speed. R. O Lord make hast. V. Glory be R. As it was in THE HIMN. The Complin hour comes last, to call Us to our own Live's funerall. Ah hartlesse task! yet hope takes head; And lives in Him that here lyes dead. Run, Mary, run! Bring hither all the Blest Arabia, for thy Royall Phœnix'nest; Pour on thy noblest sweets, Which, when they touch This sweeter Body, shall indeed be such. But must thy bed, lord, be a borow'd grave Who lend'st to all things All the Life they have. O rather use this Heart, thus farr a fitter Stone, 'Cause, though a hard &amp; cold one, yet it is thine owne. Amen. The Antiphona. O save us then Mercyfull King of men! Since thou wouldst needs be thus A Saviour, &amp; at such à rate, for us; Save us, o save us, lord. We now will own no shorter wish, nor name a narrower word. Thy blood bids us be bold. Thy Wounds give us fair hold. Thy Sorrows chide our shame. Thy Crosse, thy Nature, &amp; thy name Advance our claim And cry with one accord Save them, o save them, lord. THE RECOMMENDATION. These Houres, &amp; that which hover's o're my End, Into thy hands, and hart, lord, I, commend. Take Both to Thine Account, that I &amp; mine In that Hour, &amp; in these, may be all thine. That as I dedicate my devoutest Breath To make a kind of Life for my lord's Death, So from his living, &amp; life-giving Death, My dying Life may draw a new, &amp; never fleeting Breath. UPON THE H. SEPULCHER. Here where our Lord once lay'd his Head, Now the grave lyes Buryed. VEXILLA REGIS, THE HYMN OF THE HOLY CROSSE. I Look up, languisting Soul! Lo where the fair Badg of thy faith calls back thy care, And biddes thee ne're forget Thy life is one long Debt Of love to Him, who on this painfull Tree Paid back the flesh he took for thee. II Lo, how the streames of life, from that full nest Of loves, thy lord's too liberall brest, Flow in an amorous floud Of Water wedding Blood. With these he wash't thy stain, transfer'd thy smart, And took it home to his own heart. III But though great Love, greedy of such sad gain Usurp't the Portion of Thy pain, And from the nailes &amp; spear Turn'd the steel point of fear, Their use is chang'd, not lost; and now they move. Not stings of wrath, but wounds of love. IV Tall Tree of life! thy truth makes good What was till now ne're understood, Though the prophetick king Struck lowd his faithfull string. It was thy wood he meant should make the Throne For a more then Salomon. V Larg throne of love! Royally spred With purple of too Rich a red. Thy crime is too much duty; Thy Burthen, too much beauty; Glorious, or Greivous more? thus to make good Thy costly excellence with thy King's own Blood. VI Even ballance of both worlds! our world of sin, And that of grace heavn way'd in Him, Us with our price thou weighed'st; Our price for us thou payed'st; Soon as the right-hand scale rejoyc't to prove How much Death weigh'd more light then love. VII Hail, our alone hope! let thy fair head shoot Aloft; and fill the nations with thy noble fruit. The while our hearts &amp; we Thus graft our selves on thee; Grow thou &amp; they. And be thy fair increase The sinner's pardon &amp; the just man's peace. Live, o for ever live &amp; reign The Lamb whom his own love hath slain! And let thy lost sheep live to'inherit That Kingdom which this Crosse did merit. Amen. TO OUR B. LORD UPON THE CHOISE OF HIS Sepulcher. How life &amp; death in Thee Agree! Thou hadst a virgin womb, And tomb. A Joseph did betroth Them both. CHARITAS NIMIA. OR THE DEAR BARGAIN. Lord, what is man? why should he coste thee So dear? what had his ruin lost thee? Lord what is man? that thou hast overbought So much a thing of nought? Love is too kind, I see; &amp; can Make but à simple merchant man. 'Twas for such sorry merchandise, Bold Painters have putt out his Eyes. Alas, sweet lord, what wer't to thee If there were no such wormes as we? Heav'n ne're the lesse still heavn would be, Should Mankind dwell In the deep hell. What have his woes to doe with thee? Let him goe weep O're his own wounds; Seraphims will not sleep Nor spheares let fall their faithfull rounds. Still would The youthfull Spirits sing; And still thy spatious Palace ring. Still would those beauteous ministers of light Burn all as bright, And bow their flaming heads before thee Still thrones &amp; Dominations would adore thee Still would those ever-wakefull sons of fire Keep warm thy prayse Both nights &amp; dayes, And teach thy lov'd name to their noble lyre. Let froward Dust then doe it's kind; And give it self for sport to the proud wind. Why should a peice of peevish clay plead shares In the Æternity of thy old cares? Why shouldst you bow thy awfull Brest to see What mine own madnesses have done with me? Should not the king still keepe his throne Because some desperate Fool's undone? Or will the world's Illustrious eyes Weep for every worm that dyes; Will the gallant sun E're the lesse glorious run? Will he hang down his golden head Or e're the sooner seek his western bed, Because some foolish fly Growes wanton, &amp; will dy? If I were lost in misery, What was it to thy heavn &amp; thee? What was it to thy pretious blood If my foul Heart call'd for a floud? What if my faithlesse soul &amp; I Would needs fall in With guilt &amp; sin, What did the Lamb, that he should dy? What did the lamb, that he should need? When the wolf sins, himself to bleed? If my base lust, Bargain'd with Death &amp; well-beseeming dust Why should the white Lamb's bosom write The purple name Of my sin's shame? Why should his unstaind brest make good My blushes with his own heart-blood? O my Saviour, make me see How dearly thou hast payd for me That lost again my Life may prove As then in Death, so now in love. SANCTA MARIA DOLORUM OR THE MOTHER OF SORROWS. A Patheticall descant upon the devout Plainsong OF STABAT MATER DOLOROSA. I In shade of death's sad Tree Stood Dolefull Shee. Ah She! now by none other Name to be known, alas, but Sorrow's Mother. Before her eyes Her's, &amp; the whole world's joyes, Hanging all torn she sees; and in his woes And Paines, her Pangs &amp; throes. Each wound of His, from every Part, All, more at home in her one heart. II What kind of marble than Is that cold man Who can look on &amp; see, Nor keep such noble sorrowes company? Sure ev'en from you (My Flints) some drops are due To see so many unkind swords contest So fast for one soft Brest. While with à faithfull, mutuall, floud Her eyes bleed Teares, his wounds weep Blood. III O costly intercourse Of deaths, &amp; worse Divided loves. While son &amp; mother Discourse alternate wounds to one another; Quick Deaths that grow And gather, as they come &amp; goe: His Nailes write swords in her, which soon her heart Payes back, with more then their own smart; Her Swords, still growing with his pain, Turn Speares, &amp; straight come home again. IV She sees her son, her God, Bow with à load Of borrowd sins; And swimme In woes that were not made for Him. Ah hard command Of love! Here must she stand Charg'd to look on, &amp; with à stedfast ey See her life dy: Leaving her only so much Breath As serves to keep alive her death. V O Mother turtle-dove! Soft sourse of love That these dry lidds might borrow Something from thy full Seas of sorrow! O in that brest Of thine (the noblest nest Both of love's fires &amp; flouds) might I recline This hard, cold, Heart of mine! The chill lump would relent, &amp; prove Soft subject for the seige of love. VI O teach those wounds to bleed In me; me, so to read This book of loves, thus writ In lines of death, my life may coppy it With loyall cares. O let me, here, claim shares; Yeild somthing in thy sad prærogative (Great Queen of greifes) &amp; give Me too my teares; who, though all stone, Think much that thou shouldst mourn alone. VII Yea let my life &amp; me Fix here with thee, And at the Humble foot Of this fair Tree take our eternall root. That so we may At least be in loves way; And in these chast warres while the wing'd wounds flee So fast'twixt him &amp; thee, My brest may catch the kisse of some kind dart, Though as at second hand, from either heart. VIII O you, your own best Darts Dear, dolefull hearts! Hail; &amp; strike home &amp; make me see That wounded bosomes their own weapons be. Come wounds! come darts! Nail'd hands! &amp; peirced hearts! Come your whole selves, sorrow's great son &amp; mother! Nor grudge à yonger-Brother Of greifes his portion, who (had all their due) One single wound should not have left for you. IX Shall I, sett there So deep a share (Dear wounds) &amp; onely now In sorrows draw no Dividend with you? O be more wise If not more soft, mine eyes! Flow, tardy founts! &amp; into decent showres Dissolve my Dayes &amp; Howres. And if thou yet (faint soul!) deferr To bleed with him, fail not to weep with her. X Rich Queen, lend some releife; At least an almes of greif To'a heart who by sad right of sin Could prove the whole summe (too sure) due to him. By all those stings Of love, sweet bitter things, Which these torn hands transcrib'd on thy true heart O teach mine too the art To study him so, till we mix Wounds; and become one crucifix. XI O let me suck the wine So long of this chast vine Till drunk of the dear wounds, I be A lost Thing to the world, as it to me. O faithfull freind Of me &amp; of my end! Fold up my life in love; and lay't beneath My dear lord's vitall death. Lo, heart, thy hope's whole Plea! Her pretious Breath Powr'd out in prayrs for thee; thy lord's in death. UPON THE BLEEDING CRUCIFIX A SONG. I Jesu, no more! It is full tide. From thy head &amp; from thy feet, From thy hands &amp; from thy side All the purple Rivers meet. II What need thy fair head bear a part In showres, as if thine eyes had none? What need They help to drown thy heart, That strives in torrents of it's own? III Thy restlesse feet now cannot goe For us &amp; our eternall good. As they were ever wont. What though? They swimme. Alas, in their own floud. IV Thy hands to give, thou canst not lift; Yet will thy hand still giving be. It gives but ô, it self's the gift. It gives though bound; though bound 'tis free. V But ô thy side, thy deep-digg'd side! That hath a double Nilus going. Nor ever was the pharian tide Half so fruitfull, half so flowing. VI No hair so small, but payes his river To this red sea of thy blood Their little channells can deliver Somthing to the Generall floud. VII But while I speak, whither are run All the rivers nam'd before? I counted wrong. There is but one; But ô that one is one all ore. VIII Rain-swoln rivers may rise proud, Bent all to drown &amp; overflow. But when indeed all's overflow'd They themselves are drowned too. IX This thy blood's deluge, a dire chance Dear Lord to thee, to us is found A deluge of Deliverance; A deluge least we should be drown'd. N'ere wast thou in a sense so sadly true, The Well of living Waters, Lord, till now. UPON THE CROWNE OF THORNS TAKEN DOWNE From the head of our Bl. Lord, all Bloody. Know'st thou This, Souldier? 'Tis à much-chang'd plant which yet Thy selfe didst sett. O who so hard a Husbandman did ever find; A soile so kind? Is not the soile a kind one, which returnes Roses for Thornes? UPON THE BODY OF OUR BL. LORD, NAKED AND BLOODY. They 'have left thee naked, Lord, O that they had! This garment too I would they had deny'd. Thee with thy self they have too richly clad; Opening the purple wardrobe in thy side. O never could there be garment too good For thee to wear, But this, of thine own Blood. THE HYMN OF SANITE THOMAS IN ADORATION OF THE BLESSED SACRAMENT. ADORO TE With all the powres my poor Heart hath Of humble love &amp; loyall Faith, Thus lowe (my hidden life!) I bow to thee Whom too much love hath bow'd more low for me. Down down, proud sense! Discourses dy. Keep close, my soul's inquiring ey! Nor touch nor tast must look for more But each sitt still in his own Dore. Your ports are all superfluous here, Save That which lets in faith, the eare. Faith is my skill. Faith can beleive As fast as love new lawes can give. Faith is my force. Faith strength affords To keep pace with those powrfull words. And words more sure, more sweet, then they Love could not think, truth could not say. O let thy wretch find that releife Thou didst afford the faithfull theife. Plead for me, love! Alleage &amp; show That faith has farther, here, to goe And lesse to lean on. Because than Though hidd as God, wounds writt thee man, Thomas might touch; None but might see At least the suffring side of thee; And that too was thy self which thee did cover, But here ev'n That's hid too which hides the other. Sweet, consider then, that I Though allow'd nor hand nor eye To reach at thy lov'd Face; nor can Tast thee God, or touch thee Man Both yet beleive; And wittnesse thee My Lord too &amp; my God, as lowd as He. Help, lord, my Hope increase; And fill my portion in thy peace. Give love for life; nor let my dayes Grow, but in new powres to thy name &amp; praise. O dear memoriall of that Death Which lives still, &amp; allowes us breath! Rich, Royall food! Bountyfull Bread! Whose use denyes us to the dead; Whose vitall gust alone can give The same leave both to eat &amp; live; Live ever Bread of loves, &amp; be My life, my soul, my surer selfe to mee. O soft self-wounding Pelican! Whose brest weepes Balm for wounded man. Ah this way bend thy benign floud To'a bleeding Heart that gaspes for blood. That blood, whose least drops soveraign be To wash my worlds of sins from me. Come love! Come Lord! &amp; that long day For which I languish, come away. When this dry soul those eyes shall see, And drink the unseal'd sourse of thee. When Glory's sun faith's shades shall chase, And for thy veil give me thy Face. Amen. LAUDA SION SALVATOREM. THE HYMN. FOR THE BL. SACRAMENT. I Rise, Royall Sion! rise &amp; sing Thy soul's kind shepheard, thy hart's King. Stretch all thy powres; call if thou can Harpes of heavn to hands of man. This soveraign subject sitts above The best ambition of thy love. II Lo the Bread of Life, this day's Triumphant Text, provokes thy prayse. The living &amp; life-giving bread, To the great twelve distributed When Life, himself, at point to dy Of love, was his own Legacy. III Come, love! &amp; let us work a song Lowd &amp; pleasant, sweet &amp; long; Let lippes &amp; Hearts lift high the noise Of so just &amp; solemn joyes, Which on his white browes this bright day Shall hence for ever bear away. IV Lo the new Law of a new Lord. With a new Lamb blesses the Board. The aged Pascha pleads not yeares But spyes love's dawn, &amp; disappeares. Types yeild to Truthes; shades shrink away; And their Night dyes into our Day. V But lest That dy too, we are bid. Ever to doe what he once did. And by à mindfull, mystick breath That we may live, revive his Death; With a well-bles't bread &amp; wine. Transsum'd, &amp; taught to turn divine. VI The Heavn-instructed house of Faith Here a holy Dictate hath That they but lend their Form &amp; face, Themselves with reverence leave their place Nature, &amp; name, to be made good. By' a nobler Bread, more needfull Blood. VII Where nature's lawes no leave will give, Bold Faith takes heart, &amp; dares beleive In different species, name not things, Himself to me my Saviour brings, As meat in That, as Drink in this; But still in Both one Christ he is. VIII The Receiving Mouth here makes Non wound nor breach in what he takes. Let one, or one Thousand be Here Dividers, single he Beares home no lesse, all they no more, Nor leave they both lesse then before. IX Though in it self this Soverain Feast Be all the same to every Guest, Yet on the same (life-meaning) Bread The child of Death eates himself Dead. Nor is't love's fault, but sin's dire skill That thus from Life can Death distill. X When the blest signes thou broke shall see, Hold but thy Faith intire as he Who, howsoe're clad, cannot come Lesse then whole Christ in every crumme. In broken formes à stable Faith Untouch't her pretious Totall hath. XI Lo the life-food of Angells then Bow'd to the lowly mouths of men! The children's Bread; the Bridegroom's Wine. Not to be cast to dogges, or swine. XII Lo, the full, finall, Sacrifice On which all figures fix't their eyes. The ransom'd Isack, &amp; his ramme; The Manna, &amp; the Paschal Lamb. XIII Jesu Master, Just &amp; true! Our Food, &amp; faithfull Shephard too! O by thy self vouchsafe to keep, As with thy selfe thou feed'st thy Sheep. XIV O let that love which thus makes thee Mix with our low Mortality, Lift our lean Soules, &amp; sett us up Convictors of thine own full cup, Coheirs of Saints. That so all may Drink the same wine; and the same Way. Nor chang the Pasture, but the Place; To feed of Thee in thine own Face. Amen. THE HYMN. OF THE CHURCH, IN MEDITATION OF THE DAY OF JUDGMENT. I Hears't thou, my soul, with serious things Both the Psalm and sybyll sings Of a sure judge, from whose sharp Ray The world in flames shall fly away. II O that fire! before whose face Heavn &amp; earth shall find no place. O those eyes! whose angry light Must be the day of that dread Night. III O that trump! whose blast shall run An even round with the circling Sun. And urge the murmuring graves to bring Pale mankind forth to meet his king. IV Horror of nature, hell &amp; Death! When a deep Groan from beneath Shall cry we come, we come &amp; all The caves of night answer one call V O that Book! whose leaves so bright Will sett the world in severe light. O that Judge! whose hand, whose eye None can indure; yet none can fly VI Ah then, poor soul, what wilt thou say? And to what Patron chuse to pray? When starres themselves shall stagger; and The most firm foot no more then stand. VII But thou giv'st leave (dread Lord) that we Take shelter from thy self, in thee; And with the wings of thine own dove Fly to thy scepter of soft love. VIII Dear, remember in that Day Who was the cause thou cams't this way. Thy sheep was stray'd; And thou wouldst be Even lost thy self in seeking me. IX Shall all that labour, all that cost Of love, and ev'n that losse, be lost? And this lov'd soul, judg'd worth no lesse Then all that way, and wearynesse? X Just mercy then, thy Reckning be With my price, &amp; not with me: 'Twas pay'd at first with too much pain, To be pay'd twice; or once, in vain. XI Mercy (my judge) mercy I cry With blushing Cheek &amp; bleeding ey, The conscious colors of my sin Are red without &amp; pale within. XII O let thine own soft bowells pay Thy self; And so discharge that day. If sin can sigh, love can forgive. O say the word my Soul shall live. XIII Those mercyes which thy Mary found Or who thy crosse confes't &amp; crown'd, Hope tells my heart, the same loves be Still alive; and still for me. XIV Though both my Prayres &amp; teares combine, Both worthlesse are; For they are mine. But thou thy bounteous self still be; And show thou art, by saving me. XV O when thy last Frown shall proclaim The flocks of goates to folds of flame, And all thy lost sheep found shall be, Let come ye blessed then call me. XVI When the dread Ite shall divide Those Limbs of death from thy left side, Let those life-speaking lipps command That I inheritt thy right hand. XVII O hear a suppliant heart; all crush't And crumbled into contrite dust. My hope, my fear! my Judge, my Freind! Take charge of me, &amp; of my End. The HIMN O GLORIOSA DOMINA. Hail, most high, most humble one! Above the world; below thy Son Whose blush the moon beauteously marres And staines the timerous light of stares. He that made all things, had not done Till he had made Himself thy son The whole world's host would be thy guest And board himself at thy rich Brest. O boundles Hospitality! The Feast of all thing feeds on thee. The first Eve, mother of our Fall, E're she bore any one, slew all. Of Her unkind gift might we have The inheritance of a hasty Grave; Quick burye'd in the wanton Tomb Of one forbidden bitt; Had not à Better Fruit forbidden it. Had not thy healthfull womb The world's new eastern window bin And given us heav'n again, in giving Him. Thine was the Rosy Dawn that sprung the Day Which renders all the starres she stole away. Let then the Aged world be wise, &amp; all Prove nobly, here, unnaturall. 'Tis gratitude to forgett that other And call the maiden Eve their mother. Yee redeem'd Nations farr &amp; near, Applaud your happy selves in her, (All you to whom this love belongs) And keep't alive with lasting songs. Let hearts &amp; lippes speak lowd; and say Hail, door of life: &amp; sourse of day! The door was shutt, the fountain seal'd; Yet Light was seen &amp; Life reveald. The fountain seald, yet life found way. Glory to thee, great virgin's son In bosom of thy Father's blisse. The same to thee, sweet Spirit be done; As ever shall be, was, &amp; is. Amen. IN THE GLORIOUS ASSUMPTION OF OUR BLESSED LADY. THE HYMN. Hark! she is call'd, the parting houre is come Take thy Farewell, poor world! heavn must goe home. A peice of heav'nly earth; Purer &amp; brighter Then the chast starres, whose choise lamps come to light her While through the crystall orbes, clearer then they She climbes; and makes a farre more milkey way. She's calld. Hark, how the dear immortall dove Sighes to his sylver mate rise up, my love! Rise up, my fair, my spottlesse one! The winter's past, the rain is gone. The spring is come, the flowrs appear No sweets, but thou, are wanting here. Come away, my love! Come away, my dove! cast off delay, The court of heav'n is come To wait upon thee home; Come come away! The flowrs appear. Or quickly would, wert thou once here The spring is come, or if it stay, 'Tis to keep time with thy delay. The rain is gone, except so much as we Detain in needfull teares to weep the want of thee. The winter's past. or if he make lesse hast, His answer is, why she does so. If sommer come not, how can winter goe. Come away, come away. The shrill winds chide, the waters weep thy stay; The fountains murmur; &amp; each loftyest tree, Bowes low'st his heavy top, to look for thee. Come away, my love. Come away, my dove &amp;c. She's call'd again. And will she goe? When heavn bidds come, who can say no? Heavn calls her, &amp; she must away. Heavn will not, &amp; she cannot stay. Goe then; goe Glorious. On the golden wings Of the bright youth of heavn, that sings Under so sweet a Burthen. Goe, Since thy dread son will have it so. And while thou goest, our song &amp; we Will, as we may, reach after thee. Hail, holy Queen of humble hearts! We in thy prayse will have our parts. Thy pretious name shall be Thy self to us; &amp; we With holy care will keep it by us. We to the last Will hold it fast And no Assumption shall deny us. All the sweetest showres Of our fairest flowres Will we strow upon it. Though our sweets cannot make It sweeter, they can take Themselves new sweetnes from it. Maria, men &amp; Angels sing Maria, mother of our King. Live, rosy princesse, Live. And may the bright Crown of a most incomparable light Embrace thy radiant browes. O may the best Of everlasting joyes bath thy white brest. Live, our chast love, the holy mirth Of heavn; the humble pride of earth. Live, crown of woemen; Queen of men. Live mistresse of our song. And when Our weak desires have done their best, Sweet Angels come, and sing the rest. SANITE MARY MAGDALENE OR THE WEEPER. Loe where à Wounded Heart with Bleeding Eyes conspire. Is she a Flaming Fountain, or a Weeping fire! I Hail, sister springs! Parents of sylver-footed rills! Ever bubling things! Thawing crystall! snowy hills, Still spending, never spent! I mean Thy fair eyes, sweet Magdalene! II Heavens thy fair eyes be; Heavens of ever-falling starres. 'Tis seed-time still with thee And starres thou sow'st, whose harvest dares Promise the earth to counter shine Whatever makes heavn's forhead fine. III But we'are deceived all. Starres indeed they are too true; For they but seem to fall, As Heavn's other spangles doe. It is not for our earth &amp; us To shine in Things so pretious. IV Upwards thou dost weep. Heavn's bosome drinks the gentle stream. Where th'milky rivers creep, Thine floates above; &amp; is the cream. Waters above th'Heavns, what they be We'are taught best by thy Teares &amp; thee. V Every morn from hence A brisk Cherub somthing sippes Whose sacred influence Addes sweetnes to his sweetest Lippes. Then to his musick. And his song Tasts of this Breakfast all day long. VI Not in the evening's eyes When they Red with weeping are For the Sun that dyes, Sitts sorrow with a face so fair, No where but here did ever meet Sweetnesse so sad, sadnesse so sweet. VII When sorrow would be seen In her brightest majesty (For she is a Queen) Then is she drest by none but thee. Then, &amp; only then, she weares Her proudest pearles; I mean, thy Teares. VIII The deaw no more will weep The prim rose's pale cheek to deck, The deaw no more will sleep Nuzzel'd in the lilly's neck; Much reather would it be thy Tear, And leave them Both to tremble here. IX There's no need at all That the balsom-sweating bough So coyly should let fall His med'cinable teares; for now Nature hath learn't to'extract a deaw More soveraign &amp; sweet from you. X Yet let the poore drops weep (Weeping is the ease of woe) Softly let them creep, Sad that they are vanquish't so. They, though to others no releife, Balsom maybe, for their own greife. XI Such the maiden gemme By the purpling vine put on, Peeps from her parent stemme And blushes at the bridegroomes sun. This watry Blossom of thy eyn, Ripe, will make the richer wine. XII When some new bright Guest Takes up among the starres a room, And Heavn will make a feast, Angels with crystall violls come And deaw from these full eyes of thine Their master's Water: their own Wine. XIII Golden though he be, Golden Tagus murmures tho; Were his way by thee, Content &amp; quiet he would goe. So much more rich would he esteem Thy Sylver, then his golden stream. XIV Well does the May that lyes Smiling in thy cheeks, confesse The April in thine eyes. Mutuall sweetnesse they expresse. No April ere lent kinder showres, Nor May return'd more faithfull flowres. XV O cheeks! Bedds of chast loves By your own showres seasonably dash't Eyes! nests of milky doves In your own wells decently washt. O wit of love! that thus could place Fountain &amp; Garden in one face. XVI O sweet Contest; of woes With loves, of teares with smiles disputing! O fair, &amp; Freindly Foes, Each other kissing &amp; confuting! While rain &amp; sunshine, Cheekes &amp; Eyes Close in kind contrarietyes. XVII But can these fair Flouds be Freinds with the bosom fires that fill you! Can so great flames agree Æternall Teares should thus distill thee! O flouds, o fires! o suns ô showres! Mixt &amp; made freinds by love's sweet powres. XVIII Twas his well-pointed dart That digg'd these wells, &amp; drest this wine; And taught the wounded Heart The way into these weeping Eyn. Vain loves avant! bold hands forbear! The lamb hath dipp't his white foot here. XIX And now where're he strayes, Among the Galilean mountaines, Or more unwellcome wayes, He's follow'd by two faithfull fountaines; Two walking baths; two weeping motions; Portable, &amp; compendious oceans. XX O Thou, thy lord's fair store! In thy so rich &amp; rare expenses, Even when he show'd most poor, He might provoke the wealth of Princes. What Prince's wanton'st pride e're could Wash with Sylver, wipe with Gold. XXI Who is that King, but he Who calls't his Crown to be call'd thine, That thus can boast to be Waited on by a wandring mine, A voluntary mint, that strowes Warm sylver shoures where're he goes! XXII O pretious Prodigall! Fair spend-thrift of thy self! thy measure (Mercilesse love!) is all. Even to the last Pearle in thy threasure. All places, Times, &amp; objects be Thy teare's sweet opportunity. XXIII Does the day-starre rise? Still thy starres doe fall &amp; fall; Does day close his eyes? Still the Fountain weeps for all. Let night or day doe what they will, Thou hast thy task; thou weepest still. XXIV Does thy song lull the air? Thy falling teares keep faithfull time. Does thy sweet-breath'd paire Up in clouds of incense climb? Still at each sigh, that is, each stop, A bead, that is, A Tear, does drop, XXV At these thy weeping gates, (Watching their watry motion) Each winged moment waits, Takes his Tear, &amp; gets him gone. By thine Ey's tinct enobled thus Time layes him up; he's pretious. XXVI Not, so long she lived, Shall thy tomb report of thee; But, so long she greived, Thus must we date thy memory. Others by moments, months, &amp; yeares Measure their ages; thou, by Teares. XXVII So doe perfumes expire. So sigh tormented sweets, opprest With proud unpittying fires. Such Teares the suffring Rose that's vext With ungentle flames does shed, Sweating in a too warm bed. XXVIII Say, the bright brothers, The fugitive sons of those fair Eyes Your fruitfull mothers! What make you here? what hopes can tice You to be born? what cause can borrow You from Those nests of noble sorrow? XXIX Whither away so fast? For sure the sordid earth Your Sweetnes cannot tast Nor does the dust deserve their birth. Sweet, whither hast you then? o say Why you trip so fast away? XXX We goe not to seek, The darlings of Auroras bed, The rose's modest Cheek Nor the violet's humble head. Though the Feild's eyes too Weepers be Because they want such Teares as we. XXI Much lesse mean we to trace The Fortune of inferior gemmes, Preferr'd to some proud face Or pertch't upon fear'd Diadems. Crown'd Heads are toyes. We goe to meet A worthy object, our lord's Feet. A HYMN TO THE NAME AND HONOR OF THE ADMIRABLE SANITE TERESA, FOUNDRESSE of the Reformation of the Discalced Carmelites, both men &amp; Women; A WOMAN for Angelicall height of speculation, for Masculine courage of performance, more then a woman. WHO Yet a child, out ran maturity, and durst plott a Martyrdome; Love, thou art Absolute sole lord Of Life &amp; Death. To prove the word, Wee'l now appeal to none of all Those thy old Souldiers, Great &amp; tall, Ripe Men of Martyrdom, that could reach down With strong armes, their triumphant crown; Such as could with lusty breath Speak lowd into the face of death Their Great Lord's glorious name, to none Of those whose spatious Bosomes spread a throne For Love at larg to fill, spare blood &amp; sweat; And see him take a private seat, Making his mansion in the mild And milky soul of a soft child. Scarse has she learn't to lisp the name Of Martyr; yet she thinks it shame Life should so long play with that breath Which spent can buy so brave a death. She never undertook to know What death with love should have to doe; Nor has she e're yet understood Why to show love, she should shed blood Yet though she cannot tell you why, She can Love, &amp; she can Dy. Scarse has she Blood enough to make A guilty sword blush for her sake; Yet has she'a Heart dares hope to prove How much lesse strong is Death then Love. Be love but there; let poor six yeares Be pos'd with the maturest Feares Man trembles at, you straight shall find Love knowes no nonage, nor the Mind. 'Tis Love, not Yeares or Limbs that can Make the Martyr, or the man. Love touch't her Heart, &amp; lo it beates High, &amp; burnes with such brave heates; Such thirsts to dy, as dares drink up, A thousand cold deaths in one cup. Good reason. For she breathes All fire. Her weake brest heaves with strong desire Of what she may with fruitles wishes Seek for amongst her Mother's Kisses. Since 'tis not to be had at home She'l travail to à Martyrdom. No home for hers confesses she But where she may à Martyr be. She'l to the Moores; And trade with them, For this unvalued Diadem. She'l offer them her dearest Breath, With Christ's Name in't, in change for death. She'l bargain with them; &amp; will give Them God; teach them how to live In him: or, if they this deny, For him she'l teach them how to Dy. So shall she leave amongst them sown Her Lord's Blood; or at lest her own. Farewell then, all the world! Adieu. Teresa is no more for you. Farewell, all pleasures, sports, &amp; joyes, (Never till now esteemed toyes) Farewell what ever deare may be, Mother's armes or Father's knee. Farewell house, &amp; farewell home! She's for the Moores, &amp; Martyrdom. Sweet, not so fast! lo thy fair Spouse Whom thou seekst with so swift vowes, Calls thee back, &amp; bidds thee come T'embrace a milder Martyrdom. Blest powres forbid, Thy tender life Should bleed upon a barborous knife; Or some base hand have power to race Thy Brest's chast cabinet, &amp; uncase A soul kept there so sweet, ô no; Wise heavn will never have it so. Thou art love's victime; &amp; must dy A death more mysticall &amp; high. Into love's armes thou shalt let fall A still-surviving funerall. His is the Dart must make the Death Whose stroke shall tast thy hallow'd breath; A Dart thrice dip't in that rich flame Which writes thy spouse's radiant Name Upon the roof of Heav'n; where ay It shines, &amp; with a soveraign ray Beates bright upon the burning faces Of soules which in that name's sweet graces Find everlasting smiles. So rare, So spirituall, pure, &amp; fair Must be th'immortall instrument Upon whose choice point shall be sent A life so lov'd; And that there be Fitt executioners for Thee, The fair'st &amp; first-born sons of fire Blest Seraphim, shall leave their quire And turn love's souldiers, upon Thee To exercise their archerie. O how oft shalt thou complain Of a sweet &amp; subtle Pain. Of intolerable Joyes; Of a Death, in which who dyes Loves his death, and dyes again. And would for ever so be slain. And lives, &amp; dyes; and knowes not why To live, But that he thus may never leave to Dy. How kindly will thy gentle Heart Kisse the sweetly-killing Dart! And close in his embraces keep Those delicious Wounds, that weep Balsom to heal themselves with. Thus When These thy Deaths, so numerous, Shall all at last dy into one, And melt thy Soul's sweet mansion; Like a soft lump of incense, hasted By too hott a fire, &amp; wasted Into perfuming clouds, so fast Shalt thou exhale to Heavn at last In a resolving Sigh, and then O what? Ask not the Tongues of men. Angells cannot tell, suffice, Thy selfe shall feel thine own full joyes And hold them fast for ever there So soon as you first appear, The Moon of maiden starrs, thy white Mistresse, attended by such bright Soules as thy shining self, shall come And in her first rankes make thee room; Where 'mongst her snowy family Immortall well comes wait for thee. O what delight, when reveal'd Life shall stand And teach thy lipps heav'n with his hand; On which thou now maist to thy wishes Heap up thy consecrated kisses. What joyes shall seize thy soul, when she Bending her blessed eyes on thee (Those second Smiles of Heav'n) shall dart Her mild rayes through thy melting heart! Angels, thy old freinds, there shall greet thee Glad at their own home now to meet thee. All thy good Workes which went before And waited for thee, at the door, Shall own thee there; and all in one Weave a constellation Of Crowns, with which the King thy spouse Shall build up thy triumphant browes. All thy old woes shall now smile on thee And thy paines sitt bright upon thee And thy Suffrings be divine. Teares shall take comfort, &amp; turn gemms And Wrongs repent to Diademms. Ev'n thy Death shall live; &amp; new Dresse the soul that erst they slew. Thy wounds shall blush to such bright scarres As keep account of the Lamb's warres. Those rare Workes where thou shalt leave writt. Love's noble history, with witt Taught thee by none but him, while here They feed our soules, shall cloth Thine there. Each heavnly word by whose hid flame Our hard Hearts shall strike fire, the same Shall flourish on thy browes, &amp; be Both fire to us &amp; flame to thee; Whose light shall live bright in thy Face By glory, in our hearts by grace. Thou shalt look round about, &amp; see Thousands of crown'd Soules throng to be Themselves thy crown. Sons of thy vowes The virgin-births with which thy soveraign spouse Made fruitfull thy fair soul, goe now And with them all about thee bow To Him, put on (hee'l say) put on (My rosy love) That thy rich zone Sparkling with the sacred flames Of thousand soules, whose happy names Heav'n keep upon thy score. (Thy bright Life brought them first to kisse the light That kindled them to starrs.) and so Thou with the Lamb, thy lord, shalt goe; And whereso'ere he setts his white Stepps, walk with Him those wayes of light Which who in death would live to see, Must learn in life to dy like thee. AN APOLOGIE FOR THE FORE-GOING HYMNE as having been writt when the author was yet among the protestantes. Thus have I back again to thy bright name (Fair floud of holy fires!) transfus'd the flame I took from reading thee, tis to thy wrong I know, that in my weak &amp; worthlesse song Thou here art sett to shine where thy full day Scarse dawnes. O pardon if I dare to say Thine own dear bookes are guilty. For from thence I learn't to know that love is eloquence. That hopefull maxime gave me hart to try If, what to other tongues is tun'd so high, Thy praise might not speak English too; forbid (By all thy mysteryes that here ly hidde) Forbid it, mighty Love! let no fond Hate Of names &amp; wordes, so farr præjudicate. Souls are not Spaniards too, one freindly floud Of Baptism blends them all into a blood. Christ's faith makes but one body of all soules And love's that body's soul, no law controwlls Our free traffique for heav'n we may maintaine Peace, sure, with piety, though it come from Spain. What soul so e're, in any language, can Speak heav'n like her's is my souls country-man. O 'tis not spanish, but 'tis heav'n she speaks! 'Tis heav'n that lyes in ambush there, &amp; breaks From thence into the wondring reader's brest; Who feels his warm Heart into a nest Of little Eagles &amp; young loves, whose high Flights scorn the lazy dust, &amp; things that dy. There are now, whose draughts (as deep as hell) Drink up al Spain in sack. Let my soul swell With thee, strong wine of love! let others swimme In puddles; we will pledge this Seraphim Bowles full of richer blood then blush of grape Was ever guilty of, Change we too 'our shape (My soul,) Some drink from men to beasts, o then Drink we till we prove more, not lesse, then men, And turn not beasts, but Angels. Let the king Me ever into these his cellars bring Where flowes such wine as we can have of none But Him who trod the wine-presse all alone. Wine of youth, life, &amp; the sweet Deaths of love; Wine of immortall mixture; which can prove It's Tincture from the rosy nectar; wine That can exalt weak Earth; &amp; so refine Our dust, that at one draught, mortality May drink it self up, and forget to dy. THE FLAMING HEART UPON THE BOOK AND Picture of the seraphicall saint TERESA, (AS SHE IS USUALLY EXPRESSED with a Seraphim beside her.) Well meaning readers! you that come as freinds And catch the pretious name this peice pretends; Make not too much hast to' admire That fair-cheek't fallacy of fire. That is a Seraphim, they say And this the great Teresia. Readers, be rul'd by me; &amp; make Here a well-plac't &amp; wise mistake You must transpose the picture quite, And spell it wrong to read it right; Read Him for her, &amp; her for him; And call the Saint the Seraphim. Painter, what didst thou understand To put her dart into his hand! See, even the yeares &amp; size of him Showes this the mother Seraphim. This is the mistresse flame; &amp; duteous he Her happy fire-works, here, comes down to see. O most poor-spirited of men! Had thy cold Pencil kist her Pen Thou couldst not so unkindly err To show us This faint shade for Her. Why man, this speakes pure mortall frame; And mockes with female Frost love's manly flame. One would suspect thou meant'st to print Some weak, inferiour, woman saint. But had thy pale-fac't purple took Fire from the burning cheeks of that bright Booke Thou wouldst on her have heap't up all That could be found Seraphicall; What e're this youth of fire weares fair, Rosy fingers, radiant hair, Glowing cheek, &amp; glistering wings, All those fair &amp; flagrant things, But before all, that fiery Dart Had fill'd the Hand of this great Heart. Doe then as equall right requires, Since His the blushes be, &amp; her's the fires, Resume &amp; rectify thy rude design; Undresse thy Seraphim into Mine. Redeem this injury of thy art; Give Him the vail, give her the dart. Give Him the vail; that he may cover The Red cheeks of a rivall'd lover. Asham'd that our world, now, can show Nests of new Seraphims here below. Give her the Dart for it is she (Fair youth) shootes both thy shaft &amp; Thee Say, all ye wise &amp; well-peirc't hearts That live &amp; dy amidst her darts, What is't your tastfull spirits doe prove In that rare life of Her, and love? Say &amp; bear wittnes. Sends she not A Seraphim at every shott? What magazins of immortall Armes there shine! Heavn's great artillery in each love-spun line. Give then the dart to her who gives the flame; Give him the veil, who gives the shame. But if it be the frequent fate Of worst faults to be fortunate; If all's præscription; &amp; proud wrong Hearkens not to an humble song; For all the gallantry of him, Give me the suffring Seraphim. His be the bravery of all those Bright things. The glowing cheekes, the glistering wings; The Rosy hand, the radiant Dart; Leave Her alone The Flaming Heart. Leave her that; and thou shalt leave her Not one loose shaft but love's whole quiver. For in love's feild was never found A nobler weapon then a Wound. Love's passives are his activ'st part, The wounded is the wounding heart. O Heart! the æquall poise of love's both parts Bigge alike with wound &amp; darts. Live in these conquering leaves; live all the same; And walk through all tongues one triumphant Flame. Live here, great Heart; &amp; love and dy &amp; kill; And bleed &amp; wound; and yeild &amp; conquer still. Let this immortall life wherere it comes Walk in a crowd of loves &amp; Martyrdomes. Let mystick Deaths wait on't; &amp; wise soules be The love-slain wittnesses of this life of thee. O sweet incendiary! shew here thy art, Upon this carcasse of a hard, cold, hart, Let all thy scatter'd shafts of light, that play Among the leaves of thy larg Books of day, Combin'd against this Brest at once break in And take away from me my self &amp; sin, This gratious Robbery shall thy bounty be; And my best fortunes such fair spoiles of me. O thou undanted daughter of desires! By all thy dowr of Lights &amp; Fires; By all the eagle in thee, all the dove; By all thy lives &amp; deaths of love; By thy larg draughts of intellectuall day, And by thy thirsts of love more large then they; By all thy brim-fill'd Bowles of feirce desire By thy last Morning's draught of liquid fire; By the full kingdome of that finall kisse That seiz'd thy parting Soul, &amp; seal'd thee his; By all the heav'ns thou hast in him (Fair sister of the Seraphim!) By all of Him we have in Thee; Leave nothing of my Self in me. Let me so read thy life, that I Unto all life of mine may dy. A SONG. [Lord, when the sense of thy sweet grace] Lord, when the sense of thy sweet grace Sends up my soul to seek thy face. Thy blessed eyes breed such desire, I dy in love's delicious Fire. O love, I am thy Sacrifice. Be still triumphant, blessed eyes. Still shine on me, fair suns! that I Still may behold, though still I dy. Second part. Though still I dy, I live again; Still longing so to be still slain, So gainfull is such losse of breath. I dy even in desire of death. Still live in me this loving strife Of living Death &amp; dying Life. For while thou sweetly slayest me Dead to my selfe, I live in Thee. PRAYER. AN ODE, WHICH WAS Præfixed to a little Práyer-book given to a young GENTLE-WOMAN. Lo here a little volume, but great Book! A nest of new-born sweets; Whose native fires disdaining To ly thus folded, &amp; complaining Of these ignoble sheets, Affect more comly bands (Fair one) from the kind hands And confidently look To find the rest Of a rich binding in your Brest. It is, in one choise handfull, heavenn; &amp; all Heavn's Royall host; incamp't thus small To prove that true schooles use to tell, Ten thousand Angels in one point can dwell. It is love's great artillery Which here contracts it self, &amp; comes to ly Close couch't in their white bosom: &amp; from thence As from a snowy fortresse of defence, Against their ghostly foes to take their part, And fortify the hold of their chast heart. It is an armory of light Let constant use but keep it bright, You'l find it yeilds To holy hands &amp; humble hearts More swords &amp; sheilds Then sin hath snares, or Hell hath darts. Only be sure The hands be pure That hold these weapons; &amp; the eyes Those of turtles, chast &amp; true; Wakefull &amp; wise; Here is a freind shall fight for you, Hold but this book before their heart; Let prayer alone to play his part, But ô the heart That studyes this high Art Must be a sure house-keeper; And yet no sleeper. Dear soul, be strong. Mercy will come e're long And bring his besom fraught with blessings, Flowers of never fading graces To make immortall dressings For worthy soules, whose wise embraces Store up themselves for Him, who is alone The Spouse of Virgins &amp; the Virgin's son. But if the noble Bridegroom, when he come, Shall find the loytering Heart from home; Leaving her chast aboad To gadde abroad Among the gay mates of the god of flyes; To take her pleasure &amp; to play And keep the devill's holyday; To dance th'sunshine of some smiling But beguiling Spheares of sweet &amp; sugred Lyes, Some slippery Pair Of false, perhaps as fair, Flattering but forswearing eyes; Doubtlesse some other heart Will gett the start Mean while, &amp; stepping in before Will take possession of that sacred store Of hidden sweets &amp; holy joyes. Words which are not heard with Eares (Those tumultuous shops of noise) Effectuall wispers, whose still voice The soul it selfe more feeles then heares; Amorous languishments; luminous trances; Sights which are not seen with eyes; Spirituall &amp; soul-peircing glances Whose pure &amp; subtil lightning flyes Home to the heart, &amp; setts the house on fire And melts it down in sweet desire: Yet does not stay To ask the windows leave to passe that way; Delicious Deaths; soft exalations Of soul; dear &amp; divine annihilations; A thousand unknown rites Of joyes &amp; rarefy'd delights; A hundred thousand goods, glories, &amp; graces, And many a mystick thing Which the divine embraces Of the deare spouse of spirits with them will bring For which it is no shame That dull mortality must not know a name. Of all this store Of blessings &amp; ten thousand more (If when he come He find the Heart from home) Doubtlesse he will unload Himself some other where, And poure abroad His pretious sweets On the fair soul whom first he meets. O fair, ô fortunate! O riche, ô dear! O happy &amp; thrice happy she Selected dove Who ere she be, Whose early love With winged vowes Makes hast to meet her morning spouse And close with his immortall kisses. Happy indeed, who never misses To improve that pretious hour, And every day Seize her sweet prey All fresh &amp; fragrant as he rises Dropping with a baulmy Showr A delicious dew of spices; O let the blissfull heart hold fast Her heavnly arm-full, she shall tast At once ten thousand paradises; She shall have power To rifle &amp; deflour The rich &amp; roseall spring of those rare sweets Which with a swelling bosome there she meets Boundles &amp; infinite Bottomles treasures Of pure inebriating pleasures. Happy proof! she shal discover What joy, what blisse, How many Heav'ns at once it is To have her God become her Lover. TO THE SAME PARTY COUNCEL CONCERNING HER CHOISE. Dear, heavn-designed Soul! Amongst the rest Of suters that beseige your Maiden brest, Why may not I My fortune try And venture to speak one good word Not for my self alas, but for my dearer Lord? You'ave seen allready, in this lower sphear Of froth &amp; bubbles, what to look for here. Say, gentle soul, what can you find But painted shapes, Peacocks &amp; Apes, Illustrious flyes, Guilded dunghills, glorious Lyes, Goodly surmises And deep disguises, Oathes of water, words of wind? Truth biddes me say, 'tis time you cease to trust Your soul to any son of dust. 'Tis time you listen to a braver love, Which from above Calls you up higher And biddes you come And choose your roome Among his own fair sonnes of fire, Where you among The golden throng That watches at his palace doores May passe along And follow those fair starres of yours; Starrs much too fair &amp; pure to wait upon The false smiles of a sublunary sun. Sweet, let me prophesy that at last t'will prove Your wary love Layes up his purer &amp; more pretious vowes, And meanes them for a farre more worthy Spouse Then this world of Lyes can give ye Ev'n for Him with whom nor cost, Nor love, nor labour can be lost; Him who never will deceive ye. Let not my lord, the Mighty lover Of soules, disdain that I discover The hidden art Of his high stratagem to win your heart, It was his heavnly art Kindly to crosse you In your mistaken love, That, at the next remove Thence he might tosse you And strike your troubled heart Home to himself; to hide it in his brest The bright ambrosiall nest, Of love, of life, &amp; everlasting rest. Happy Mystake! That thus shall wake Your wise soul, never to be wonne Now with a love below the sun. Your first choyce failes, ô when you choose agen May it not be amongst the sonnes of Men. ALEXIAS. THE COMPLAINT OF THE FORSAKEN WIFE OF SANITE ALEXIS. THE FIRST ELEGIE. I late the roman youth's lov'd prayse &amp; pride, Whom long none could obtain, though thousands try'd, Lo here am left (alas), For my lost mate T'embrace my teares, &amp; kisse an unkind Fate. Sure in my early woes starres were at strife, And try'd to make a Widow ere a Wife. Nor can I tell (and this new teares doth breed) In what strange path my lord's fair footsteppes bleed. O knew I where he wander'd, I should see Some solace in my sorrow's certainty I'd send my woes in words should weep for me. (Who knowes how powrfull well-writt praires would be?) Sending's too slow a word, my selfe would fly. Who knowes my own heart's woes so well as I? But how shall I steal hence? Alexis thou Ah thou thy self, alas, hast taught me how. Love too, that leads the, would lend the wings To bear me harmlesse through the hardest things. And where love lends the wing, &amp; leads the way, What dangers can there be dare say me nay? If I be shipwrack't Love shall teach to swimme. If drown'd; sweet is the death indur'd for Him, The noted sea shall change his name with me; I, 'mongst the blest Starres a new name shall be. And sure where lovers make their watry graves The weeping mariner will augment the waves. For who so hard, but passing by that way Will take acquaintance of my woes, &amp; say Here't was the roman Maid found a hard fate While through the world she sought her wandring mate. Here perish't she, poor heart, heavns, be my vowes As true to me, as she was to her spouse. O live, so rare a love! live! &amp; in thee The too frail life of femal constancy. Farewell, &amp; shine, fair soul, shine there above Firm in thy crown, as here fast in thy love. There thy lost fugitive thou'hast found at last. Be happy; and for ever hold him fast. THE SECONDE ELEGIE. Though All the joyes I had fleed hence with Thee, Unkind! yet are my Teares still true to me. I'am wedded ore again since thou art gone; Nor couldst thou, cruell, leave me quite alone. Alexis' widdow now is sorrow's wife. With him shall I weep out my weary life. Wellcome, my sad sweet Mate! Now have I gott At last a constant love that leaves me not. Firm he, as thou art false, Nor need my cryes Thus vex the earth &amp; teare the skyes. For him, alas, n'ere shall I need to be Troublesom to the world, thus, as for thee. For thee I talk to trees; with silent groves Expostulate my woes &amp; much-wrong'd loves. Hills &amp; relentlesse rockes, or if there be Things that in hardnesse more allude to thee; To these I talk in teares, &amp; tell my pain; And answer too for them in teares again. How oft have I wept out the weary sun! My watry hour-glasse hath old time outrunne. O I am learned grown, Poor love &amp; I Have study'd over all astrology. I'am perfect in heavn's state, with every starr My skillfull greife is grown familiar. Rise, fairest of those fires; whate're thou be Whose rosy beam shall point my sun to me. Such as the sacred light that erst did bring The Eastern princes to their infant king. O rise, pure lamp! &amp; lend thy golden ray That weary love at last may find his way. THE THIRD ELEGIE. Rich, churlish Land! that hid'st so long in thee, My treasures, rich, alas, by robbing mee. Needs must my miseryes owe that man a spite Who e're he be was the first wandring knight. O had he nere been at that cruell cost Nature's virginity had nere been lost. Seas had not bin rebuk't by sawcy oares But ly'n lock't up safe in their sacred shores. Men had not spurn'd at mountaines; nor made warrs With rocks; nor bold hands struck the world's strong barres. Nor lost in too larg bounds, our little Rome Full sweetly with it selfe had dwell't at home. My poor Alexis, then in peacefull life, Had under some low roofe lov'd his plain wife But now, ah me, from where he has no foes He flyes; &amp; into willfull exile goes. Cruell return. Or tell the reason why Thy dearest parents have deserv'd to dy. And I, what is my crime I cannot tell, Unlesse it be a crime to'have lov'd too well. If Heates of holyer love &amp; high desire Make bigge thy fair brest with immortall fire, What needes my virgin lord fly thus from me, Who only wish his virgin wife to be? Wittnesse, chast heavns! no happyer vowes I know Then to a virgin Grave untouch't to goe. Love's truest Knott by venus is not ty'd; Nor doe embraces onely make a bride. The Queen of angels, (and men chast as You) Was Maiden Wife &amp; Maiden Mother too. Cecilia, Glory of her name &amp; blood With happy gain her maiden vowes made good. The lusty bridegroom made approach: young man Take heed (said she) take heed, Valerian! My bosome's guard, a Spirit great &amp; strong, Stands arm'd, to sheild me from all wanton wrong. My Chastity is sacred; &amp; my sleep Wakefull, her dear vowes undefil'd to keep. Pallas beares armes, forsooth, and should there be No fortresse built for true Virginity? No gaping gorgon, this. None, like the rest Of your learn'd lyes. Here you'l find no such jest. I'am yours, O were my God, my Christ so too, I'd know no name of love on earth but you. He yeilds, and straight Baptis'd, obtains the grace To gaze on the fair souldier's glorious face. Both mixt at last their blood in one rich bed Of rosy Martyrdome, twice Married. O burn our hymen bright in such high Flame. Thy torch, terrestriall love, have here no name. How sweet the mutuall yoke of man &amp; wife, When holy fires maintain love's Heavnly life! But I, (so help me heavn my hopes to see) When thousand sought my love, lov'd none but Thee. Still, as their vain teares my firm vowes did try, Alexis, he alone is mine (said I) Half true, alas, half false, proves that poor line. Alexis is alone; But is not mine. DESCRIPTION OF A RELIGIOUS HOUSE AND CONDITION OF LIFE (OUT OF BARCLAY.) No roofes of gold o're riotous tables shining Whole dayes &amp; suns devour'd with endlesse dining; No sailes of tyrian sylk proud pavements sweeping; Nor ivory couches costlyer slumbers keeping; False lights of flairing gemmes; tumultuous joyes; Halls full of flattering men &amp; frisking boyes; Whate're false showes of short &amp; slippery good Mix the mad sons of men in mutuall blood. But Walkes &amp; unshorn woods; and soules, just so Unforc't &amp; genuine; but not shady tho. Our lodgings hard &amp; homely as our fare. That chast &amp; cheap, as the few clothes we weare. Those, course &amp; negligent, As the naturall lockes Of these loose groves, rough as th'unpolish't rockes. A hasty Portion of præscribed sleep; Obedient slumbers; that can wake &amp; weep, And sing, &amp; sigh, &amp; work, and sleep again; Still rowling à round spear of still-returning pain. Hands full of harty labours; doe much, that more they may, And work for work, not wages; let to morrow's New drops, wash off the sweat of this daye's sorrows. A long &amp; dayly-dying life, which breaths A respiration of reviving deaths. But neither are there those ignoble stings That nip the bosome of the world's best things, And lash Earth-laboring souls. No cruell guard of diligent cares, that keep Crown'd woes awake; as things too wise for sleep. But reverent discipline, &amp; religious fear, And soft obedience, find sweet biding here; Silence, &amp; sacred rest; peace, &amp; pure joyes; Kind loves keep house, ly close, make no noise, And room enough for Monarchs, while none swells Beyond the kingdomes of contentfull Cells. The self-remembring Soul sweetly recovers Her kindred with the starrs; not basely hovers Below; But meditates her immortall way Home to the originall sourse of Light &amp; intellectual Day. AN EPITAPH UPON A YOUNG MARRIED COUPLE DEAD AND BURYED TOGETHER. To these, whom Death again did wed, This Grave's their second Marriage-bed; For though the hand of fate could force 'Twixt Soul &amp; Body à Divorce, It could not sunder man &amp; Wife, 'Cause They Both lived but one life. Peace, good Reader. Doe not weep. Peace, The Lovers are asleep. They, sweet Turtles, folded ly In the last knott love could ty. And though they ly as they were dead, Their Pillow stone, their sheetes of lead, (Pillow hard, &amp; sheetes not warm) Love made the bed; They'l take no harm Let them sleep: let them sleep on. Till this stormy night be gone, Till the 'Æternall morrow dawn; Then the curtaines will be drawn 'And they wake into a light. Whose day shall never dy in Night. DEATH'S LECTURE AND THE FUNERAL OF A YOUNG GENTLEMAN Dear Reliques of a dislodg'd Soul, whose lack Makes many a mourning paper put on black! O stay a while, ere thou draw in thy head And wind thy self up close in thy cold bed. Stay but à little while, untill I call A summons worthy of thy funerall. Come then, Youth, Beauty, &amp; blood! All the soft powres. Whose sylken flatteryes swell a few fond howres Into a false æternity. Come man; Hyperbolized Nothing! know thy span; Take thine own measure here down, down, &amp; bow Before thy self in thine idæa; thou Huge emptynes! contract thy self; &amp; shrinke All thy Wild circle to a Point. O sink Lower &amp; lower yet; till thy leane size Call heavn to look on thee with narrow eyes. Lesser &amp; lesser yet; till thou begin To show a face, fitt to confesse thy Kin, Thy neighbourhood to Nothing. Proud lookes, &amp; lofty eyliddes, here putt on Your selves in your unfaign'd reflexion, Here, gallant ladyes! this unpartiall glasse (Though you be painted) showes you your true face. These death-seal'd lippes are they dare give the ly To the lowd Boasts of poor Mortality. These curtain'd windows, this retired eye Outstares the liddes of larg-look't tyranny. This posture is the brave one this that lyes Thus low, stands up (me thinkes,) thus &amp; defies The world. All-daring dust &amp; ashes! only you Of all interpreters read Nature True. TEMPERANCE. OF THE CHEAP PHYSITIAN UPON THE TRANSLATION OF LESSIUS. Goe now; and with some daring drugg Bait thy disease. And whilst they tugge, Thou to maintain their pretious strife Spend the dear treasures of thy life. Goe, take physick Doat upon Some big-nam'd composition. Th'Oraculous Doctor's mystick bills; Certain hard Words made into pills, And what at last shalt' gain by these? Only a costlyer disease. That which makes us have no need Of physick, that's Physick indeed. Hark hither, Reader! wilt thou see Nature her own physitian be? Wilt' see a man, all his own wealth, His own musick, his own health; A man whose sober soul can tell How to wear her garments well. Her garments, that upon her sitt As garments should doe, close &amp; fitt; A well-cloth'd soul; that's not opprest Nor choak't with what she should be drest. A soul sheath'd in a christall shrine; Through which all her bright features shine; As when a peice of wanton lawn A thinne, aeriall veil, is drawn Or'e beauty's face seeming to hide More sweetly showes the blushing bride. A soul, whose intellectuall beames No mists doe mask, no lazy steames. A happy soul, that all the way, To Heavn rides in a summer's day. Wouldst' see a man, whose well-warm'd blood Bathes him in a genuine flood! A man, whose tuned humors be A seat of rarest harmony? Wouldst' see blith lookes, fresh cheekes beguil Age? wouldst see december smile? Wouldst' see nests of new roses grow In a bed of reverend snow? Warm thoughts, free spirits flattering Winter's selfe into a Spring. In summe, wouldst see a man that can Live to be old, and still a man? Whose latest &amp; most leaden houres Fall with soft wings, stuck with soft flowres; And when life's sweet fable ends, Soul &amp; body part like freinds; No quarrells, murmurs, no delay; A Kisse, a Sigh, and so away. This rare one, reader, wouldst thou see? Hark hither; and thy self be He. HOPE. Hope whose weak beeing ruin'd is Alike if it succeed or if it misse! Whom ill or good does equally confound And both the hornes of fate's dilemma wound. Vain shadow; that dost vanish quite Both at full noon &amp; perfect night! The starres have not a possibility Of blessing Thee. If thinges then from their end we happy call, 'Tis hope is the most hopelesse thing of all. Hope, thou bold Taster of delight! Who in stead of doing so, devourst it quite. Thou bringst us an estate, yet leav'st us poor By clogging it with legacyes before. The joyes which we intire should wed Come deflour'd-virgins to our bed. Good fortunes without gain imported be Such mighty custom's paid to Thee. For joy like wine kep't close, does better tast; If it take air before his spirits wast. Hope fortun's cheating lottery Where for one prize, an hundred blankes there be. Fond archer, hope. Who tak'st thine aime so farr That still or short or wide thine arrowes are; Thinne empty cloud which th-ey deceives With shapes that our own fancy gives. A cloud which gilt &amp; painted now appeares But must drop presently in teares When thy false beames o're reason's light prevail, By Ignes Fatui for north starres we sail. Brother of fear more gayly clad. The merryer fool oth two, yet quite as mad. Sire of repentance, child of fond desire That blow'st the chymick &amp; the lover's fire. Still leading them insensibly'on With the strong witchcraft of Anon. By thee the one does changing nature through Her endlesse labyrinth's pursue, And th'other chases woman; while she goes More wayes &amp; turnes then hunted nature knowes. M. COWLEY. M. CRASHAWS ANSWER FOR HOPE. Dear hope! earth's dowry, &amp; heavn's debt! The entity of those that are not yet. Subtlest, but surest beeing! Thou by whom Our nothing has a definition! Substantiall shade! whose sweet allay Blends both the noones of night &amp; day. Fates cannot find out a capacity Of hurting thee. From Thee their lean dilemma, with blunt horn, Shrinkes, as the sick moon from the wholsome morn. Rich hope! love's legacy, under lock Of faith! still spending, &amp; still growing stock! Our crown-land lyes above yet each meal brings A seemly portion for the sonnes of kings. Nor will the virgin joyes we wed Come lesse unbroken to our bed, Because that from the bridall cheek of blisse Thou steal'st us down a distant kisse. Hope's chast stealth harmes no more joye's maidenhead Then spousall rites prejudge the marriage bed. Fair hope! our earlyer heav'n by thee Young time is taster to eternity. Thy generous wine with age growes strong, not sowre. Nor does it kill thy fruit, to smell thy flowre. Thy golden, growing, head never hangs down Till in the lappe of loves full noone It falls; and dyes! o no, it melts away As does the dawn into the day. As lumpes of sugar loose themselves; and twine Their supple essence with the soul of wine. Fortune? alas, above the world's low warres Hope walks; &amp; kickes the curld heads of conspiring starres. Her keel cutts not the waves where These winds stirr, Fortune's whole lottery is one blank to her. Sweet hope! kind cheat! fair fallacy by thee We are not Where nor What we be, But What &amp; Where we would be. Thus art thou Our absent Presence, and our future Now. Faith's sister! nurse of fair desire! Fear's antidote! a wise &amp; well-stay'd fire! Temper twixt chill despair, &amp; torrid joy! Queen Regent in yonge love's minority! Though the vext chymick vainly chases His fugitive gold through all her faces; Though love's more feirce, more fruitlesse, fires assay One face more fugitive then all they; True hope's a glorious hunter &amp; her chase, The God of nature in the feilds of grace. VIVE JESU.</field>

[From Archbishop Sancroft's Copy, Vol. 465, Tanner MSS, Bodleian Library, Oxford.] Luke 2. Quærit Jesum suum Maria, &amp;c. And is he gone, whom these armes held but now? Their hope, their vow? Did ever greife, &amp; joy in one poore heart Soe soone change part? Hee's gone. the fair'st flower, that e're bosome drest, My soules sweet rest. My wombes chast pride is gone, my heaven-borne boy; And where is joy? Hee's gone. &amp; his lov'd steppes to wait upon, My joy is gone. My joyes, &amp; hee are gone; my greife, &amp; I Alone must ly. Hee's gone. not leaving with me, till he come, One smile at home. Oh come then. bring Thy mother her lost joy: Oh come, sweet boy. Make hast, &amp; come, or e're my greife, &amp; I Make hast, &amp; dy. Peace, heart! the heavens are angry. all their spheres Rivall thy teares. I was mistaken. some faire sphære, or other Was thy blest mother. What, but the fairest heaven, could owne the birth Of soe faire earth? Yet sure thou did'st lodge heere. this wombe of mine Was once call'd thine. Oft have these armes thy cradle envied, Beguil'd thy bed. Oft to thy easy eares hath this shrill tongue Trembled, &amp; sung. Oft have I wrapt thy slumbers in soft aires, And stroak't thy cares. Oft hath this hand those silken casements kept, While their sunnes slept. Oft have my hungry kisses made thine eyes Too early rise. Oft have I spoild my kisses daintiest diet, To spare thy quiet. Oft from this breast to thine my love-tost heart Hath leapt, to part. Oft my lost soule have I bin glad to seeke On thy soft cheeke. Oft have these armes alas! show'd to these eyes Their now lost joyes. Dawne then to me, thou morne of mine owne day, And lett heaven stay. Oh, would'st thou heere still fixe thy faire abode, My bosome God: What hinders, but my bosome still might be Thy heaven to Thee? Whosoever shall loose his life &amp;c. Math. 16. 25. Soe I may gaine thy death, my life I'le give. (My life's thy death, &amp; in thy death I live.) Or else, my life, I'le hide thee in his grave, By three daies losse æternally to save. In cicatrices Domini Jesu. Come, brave soldjers, come, &amp; see Mighty love's Artillery. This was the conquering dart; &amp; loe There shines his quiver, there his bow. These the passive weapons are, That made great Love, a man of warre. The quiver, that he bore, did bide Soe neare, it prov'd his very side. In it there sate but one sole dart; A peircing one. his peirced heart. His weapons were nor steele, nor brasse: The weapon, that he wore, he was. For bow his unbent hand did serve, Well strung with many a broken nerve. Strange the quiver, bow, &amp; dart! A bloody side, &amp; hand, &amp; heart! But now the feild is wonne: &amp; they (The dust of Warre cleane wip'd away) The weapons now of triumph be, That were before of Victorie. In amorem divinum (Hermannus Hugo). Aeternall love! what 'tis to love thee well, None, but himselfe, who feeles it, none can tell. But oh, what to be lov'd of thee as well, None, not himselfe, who feeles it, none can tell. Upon a Gnatt burnt in a candle. Little—buzzing—wanton elfe, Perish there, &amp; thanke thy selfe. Thou deserv'st thy life to loose, For distracting such a Muse. Was it thy ambitious aime By thy death to purchase fame? Didst thou hope he would in pitty Have bestow'd a funerall ditty On thy ghoast? &amp; thou in that To have outlived Virgills gnatt? No. the treason, thou hast wrought, Might forbid thee such a thought. If that night's worke doe miscarry, Or a syllable but vary, A greater foe thou shalt me find, The destruction of thy kind. Phœbus, to revenge thy fault, In a fiery trapp thee caught; That thy winged mates might know it, And not dare disturbe a Poet. Deare, &amp; wretched was thy sport, Since thyselfe was crushed for't. Scarcely had that life a breath, Yet it found a double death; Playing in the golden flames, Thou fell'st into an inky Thames; Scorch'd, &amp; drown'd. That petty sunne A pretty Icarus hath undone. Petronius. Ales Phasiacis petita Colchis &amp;c. The bird, that's fetch't from Phasis floud, Or choicest hennes of Africk-brood; These please our palates. &amp; why these? 'Cause they can but seldome please. Whil'st the goose soe goodly white, And the drake yeeld noe delight, Though his wings conceited hewe Paint each feather, as if new. These for vulgar stomacks be, And rellish not of rarity. But the dainty Scarus, sought In farthest clime; what e're is bought With shipwracks toile, oh, that is sweet, 'Cause the quicksands hanselld it. The pretious Barbill, now groune rife, Is cloying meat. How stale is Wife? Deare wife hath ne're a handsome letter, Sweet mistris sounds a great deale better. Rose quakes at name of Cinnamon. Unlesse't be rare, what's thought upon? Horatius. Ille &amp; ne fasto te posuit die &amp;c. Shame of thy mother soyle! ill-nurtur'd tree! Sett to the mischeife, of posteritie! That hand, (what e're it wer) that was thy nurse, Was sacrilegious, (sure) or somewhat worse. Black, as the day was dismall, in whose sight Thy rising topp first staind the bashfull light. That man (I thinke) wrested the feeble life From his old father. that mans barbarous knife Conspird with darknes 'gainst the strangers throate; (Whereof the blushing walles tooke bloody note) Huge high-floune poysons, ev'n of Colchos breed, And whatsoe're wild sinnes black thoughts doe feed, His hands have padled in; his hands, that found Thy traiterous root a dwelling in my ground. Perfidious totterer! longing for the staines Of thy kind Master's well-deserving braines. Mans daintiest care, &amp; caution cannot spy The subtile point of his coy destiny, W?? way it threats. with feare the merchant's mind Is plough'd as deepe, as is the sea with wind, (Rowz'd in an angry tempest), Oh the sea! Oh! that's his feare; there flotes his destiny: While from another (unseene) corner blowes The storme of fate, to w?? his life he owes. By Parthians bow the soldier lookes to die, (Whose hands are fighting, while their feet doe flie.) The Parthian starts at Rome's imperiall name, Fledg'd with her eagles wing; the very chaine Of his captivity rings in his eares. Thus, ô thus fondly doe wee pitch our feares Farre distant from our fates. our fates, that mocke Our giddy feares with an unlook't for shocke. A little more, &amp; I had surely seene Thy greisly Majesty, Hell's blackest Queene; And Œacus on his Tribunall too, Sifting the soules of guilt; &amp; you, (oh you!) You ever-blushing meads, where doe the Blest Farre from darke horrors home appeale to rest. There amorous Sappho plaines upon her Lute Her loves crosse fortune, that the sad dispute Runnes murmuring on the strings. Alcæus there In high-built numbers wakes his golden lyre, To tell the world, how hard the matter went, How hard by sea, by warre, by banishment. There these brave soules deale to each wondring eare, Such words, soe precious, as they may not weare Without religious silence; above all Warres ratling tumults, or some tyrants fall. The thronging clotted multitude doth feast. What wonder? when the hundred-headed beast Hangs his black lugges, stroakt with those heavenly lines; The Furies curl'd snakes meet in gentle twines, And stretch their cold limbes in a pleasing fire. Prometheus selfe, &amp; Pelops sterved sire Are cheated of their paines; Orion thinkes Of Lions now noe more, or spotted Linx. On y? Gunpowder-Treason. I sing Impiety beyond a name: Who stiles it any thinge, knowes not the same. Dull, sluggish Ile! what more than lethargy Gripes thy cold limbes soe fast, thou canst not fly, And start from off thy center? hath heaven's love Stuft thee soe full with blisse, thou can'st not move? If soe, oh Neptune, may she farre be throwne By thy kind armes to a kind world unknowne: Lett her survive this day, once mock her fate, And shee's an Island truely fortunate. Lett not my suppliant breath raise a rude storme To wrack my suite. oh keepe pitty warme In thy cold breast, &amp; yearely on this day Mine eyes a tributary streame shall pay. Do'st thou not see an exhalation Belch'd from the sulph'ry lungs of Phlegeton? A living Comet, whose pestiferous breath Adulterates the Virgin aire? with death It labours. stif'led nature's in a swound, Ready to dropp into a chaos, round About horror's displai'd; It doth portend, That earth a shoure of stones to heaven shall send, And crack the Christall globe; the milky streame Shall in a silver rain runne out, whose creame Shall choake the gaping earth, w?? then shall fry In flames, &amp; of a burning fever dy. That wonders may in fashion be, not rare, A winter's thunder with a groane shall scare, And rouze the sleepy ashes of the dead, Making them skip out of their dusty bed. Those twinckling eyes of heaven, w?? ev'n now shin'd, Shall with one flash of lightning be struck blind. The sea shall change his youthfull greene, &amp; slide Along the shore in a grave purple tide. It does præsage, that a great Prince shall climbe And gett a starry throne before his time. To usher in this shoale of Prodigies, Thy infants, Æolus, will not suffice. Noe, noe, a giant wind, that will not spare To tosse poore men like dust into the aire; Justle downe mountaines: Kings courts shall be sent, Like bandied balles, into the firmament. Atlas shall be tript upp, Jove's gate shall feele The weighty rudenes of his boysterous heele. All this it threats, &amp; more: Horro?, that flies To th'Empyræum of all miseries. Most tall Hyperbole's cannot descry it; Mischeife, that scornes expression should come nigh it. All this it only threats. the Meteor ly'd; It was exhal'd, a while it hung, &amp; dy'd. Heaven kickt the Monster downe. downe it was throwne, The fall of all things it præsag'd, its owne It quite forgott. the fearfull earth gave way, And durst not touch it, heere it made noe stay. At last it stopt at Pluto's gloomy porch; He streightway lighted upp his pitchy torch. Now to those toiling soules it gives its light, W?? had the happines to worke i'th' night. They banne the blaze, &amp; curse its curtesy, For lighting them unto their misery. Till now hell was imperfect; it did need Some rare choice torture; now 'tis hell indeed. Then glutt thy dire lampe with the warmest blood, That runnes in violett pipes: none other food It can digest. then watch the wildfire well, Least it breake forth, &amp; burne thy sooty cell. Upon the Gunpowder-Treason. Reach me a quill, pluckt from the flaming wing Of Pluto's Mercury, that I may sing Death to the life. My inke shall be the blood Of Cerberus, or Alecto's viperous brood. Unmated malice! Oh unpeer'd despight! Such as the sable pinions of the night Never durst hatch before: extracted see The very Quintessence of villanie. I feare to name it; least that he, w?? heares, Should have his soule frighted beyond the spheres. Heaven was asham'd, to see our mother Earth Engender with the Night, &amp; teeme a birth Soe foule, one minutes light had it but seene, The fresh face of the morne had blasted beene. Her rosy cheekes you should have seene noe more Dy'd in vermilion blushes, as before: But in a vaile of clouds mufling her head A solitary life she would have led. Affrighted Phœbus would have lost his way, Giving his wanton palfreys leave to play Olympick games in the' Olympian plaines, His trembling hands loosing the golden raines. The Queene of night gott the greene sicknes then, Sitting soe long at ease in her darke denne, Not daring to peepe forth, least that a stone Should beate her headlong from her jetty throne. Jove's twinckling tapers, that doe light the world, Had beene puft out, &amp; from their stations hurl'd. Æol kept in his wrangling sonnes, least they With this grand blast should have bin bloune away. Amazed Triton with his shrill alarmes Bad sporting Neptune to pluck in his armes, And leave embracing of the Isles, least hee Might be an actor in this Tragœdy. Nor should wee need thy crisped waves, for wee An Ocean could have made t'have drowned thee. Torrents of salt teares from our eyes should runne, And raise a deluge, where the flaming sunne Should coole his fiery wheeles, &amp; never sinke Soe low to give his thirsty stallions drinke. Each soule in sighes had spent its dearest breath, As glad to waite upon their King in death. Each winged Chorister would swan-like sing A mournfull Dirge to their deceased King. The painted meddowes would have laught no more For joye of their neate coates; but would have tore Their shaggy locks, their flowry mantles turn'd Into dire sable weeds, &amp; sate, &amp; mourn'd. Each stone had streight a Niobe become, And wept amaine; then rear'd a costly tombe, T'entombe the lab'ring earth. for surely shee Had died just in her delivery. But when Jove's winged Heralds this espied, Upp to th'Almighty thunderer they hied, Relating this sad story. streight way hee The monster crusht, maugre their midwiferie. And may such Pythons never live to see The Light's faire face, but still abortive bee. Upon the Gunpowder-Treason. Grow plumpe, leane Death; his Holinesse a feast Hath now præpar'd, &amp; you must be his guest. Come grimme destruction, &amp; in purple gore Dye sev'n times deeper than they were before Thy scarlet robes. for heere you must not share A common banquett. noe, heere's princely fare. And least thy bloodshott eyes should lead aside This masse of cruelty, to be thy guide Three coleblack sisters, (whose long sutty haire, And greisly visages doe fright the aire; When Night beheld them, shame did almost turne Her sable cheekes into a blushing morne, To see some fowler than herselfe) these stand, Each holding forth to light the aery brand, Whose purer flames tremble to be soe nigh, And in fell hatred burning, angry dy, Sly, lurking treason is his bosome freind, Whom faint, &amp; palefac't feare doth still attend. These need noe invitation. onely thou Black dismall horro?, come; make perfect now Th'Epitome of hell: oh lett thy pinions Be a gloomy Canopy to Pluto's minions. In this infernall Majesty close shrowd Your selves, your Stygian states; a pitchy clowd Shall hang the roome, &amp; for your tapers bright, Sulphureous flames, snatch'd from æternall night. But rest, affrighted Muse; thy silver wings May not row neerer to these dusky Kings. Cast back some amorous glances on the cates, That heere are dressing by the hasty fates, Nay. stopp thy clowdy eyes. it is not good, To droune thy selfe in this pure pearly flood. But since they are for fire-workes, rather prove A Phenix, &amp; in chastest flames of love Offer thy selfe a Virgin sacrifice To quench the rage of hellish deities. But dares destruction eate these candid breasts, The Muses, &amp; the Graces sugred neasts? Dares hungry death snatch of one cherry lipp? Or thirsty treason offer once to sippe One dropp of this pure Nectar, w?? doth flow In azure channells warme through mounts of snow? The roses fresh, conserved from the rage, And cruell ravishing of frosty age, Feare is afraid to tast of: only this, He humbly crav'd to banquett on a kisse. Poore meagre horro? streightwaies was amaz'd, And in the stead of feeding stood, &amp; gaz'd. Their appetites were gone at th' very sight; But yet their eyes surfett with sweet delight. Only the Pope a stomack still could find; But yett they were not powder'd to his mind. Forthwith each God stept from his starry throne, And snatch'd away the banquett. every one Convey'd his sweet delicious treasury To the close closet of æternity: Where they will safely keepe it, from the rude, And rugged touch of Pluto's multitude. Upon the King's Coronation. Sound forth, cœlestiall Organs, lett heavens quire Ravish the dancing orbes, make them mount higher With nimble capers, &amp; force Atlas tread Upon his tiptoes, e're his silver head Shall kisse his golden burthen. Thou, glad Isle, That swim'st as deepe in joy, as Seas, now smile; Lett not thy weighty glories, this full tide Of blisse, debase thee; but with a just pride Swell: swell to such an height, that thou maist vye With heaven itselfe for stately Majesty. Doe not deceive mee, eyes: doe I not see In this blest earth heaven's bright Epitome, Circled with pure refined glory? heere I veiw a rising sunne in this our sphere, Whose blazing beames, maugre the blackest night, And mists of greife, dare force a joyfull light. The gold, in w?? he flames, does well præsage A precious season, &amp; a golden age. Doe I not see joy keepe his revels now, And sitt triumphing in each cheerfull brow? Unmixt felicity with silver wings Broodeth this sacred place. hither peace brings The choicest of her olive-crownes, &amp; praies To have them guilded with his courteous raies. Doe I not see a Cynthia, who may Abash the purest beauties of the day? To whom heavens lampes often in silent night Steale from their stations to repaire their light. Doe I not see a constellation, Each little beame of w?? would make a sunne? I meane those three great starres, who well may scorn Acquaintance with the Usher of the morne. To gaze upon such starres each humble eye Would be ambitious of Astronomie. Who would not be a Phœnix, &amp; aspire To sacrifice himselfe in such sweet fire? Shine forth, ye flaming sparkes of Deity, Yee perfect emblemes of divinity. Fixt in your spheres of glory, shed from thence, The treasures of our lives, your influence. For if you sett, who may not justly feare, The world will be one Ocean, one great teare. Upon the King's Coronation. Strange metamorphosis! It was but now The sullen heaven had vail'd its mournfull 'row With a black maske: the clouds with child by greife Traveld th'Olympian plaines to find releife. But at the last (having not soe much power As to refraine) brought forth a costly shower Of pearly drops, &amp; sent her numerous birth (As tokens of her greife) unto the earth. Alas, the earth, quick drunke with teares, had reel'd From off her center, had not Jove upheld The staggering lumpe: each eye spent all its store, As if heereafter they would weepe noe more. Streight from this sea of teares there does appeare Full glory flaming in her owne free sphere. Amazed Sol throwes off his mournfull weeds, Speedily harnessing his fiery steeds, Up to Olympus stately topp he hies, From whence his glorious rivall hee espies. Then wondring starts, &amp; had the curteous night With held her vaile, h' had forfeited his sight. The joyfull sphæres with a delicious sound Afright th'amazed aire, &amp; dance a round To their owne Musick, nor (untill they see This glorious Phœbus sett) will quiet bee. Each aery Siren now hath gott her song, To whom the merry lambes doe tripp along The laughing meades, as joyfull to behold Their winter coates cover'd with flaming gold. Such was the brightnesse of this Northerne starre, It made the Virgin Phœnix come from farre To be repaird: hither she did resort, Thinking her father had remov'd his court. The lustre of his face did shine soe bright, That Rome's bold Eagles now were blinded quite, The radiant darts, shott from his sparkling eyes, Made every mortall gladly sacrifice A heart burning in love; all did adore This rising sunne, their faces nothing wore, But smiles, &amp; ruddy joyes, &amp; at this day All melancholy clowds vanisht away. Upon the birth of the Princesse Elizabeth. Bright starre of Majesty, oh shedd on mee, A precious influence, as sweet as thee. That with each word, my loaden pen letts fall, The fragrant spring may be perfum'd withall. That Sol from them may suck an honied shower, To glutt the stomack of his darling flower. With such a sugred livery made fine, They shall proclaime to all, that they are thine. Lett none dare speake of thee, but such as thence Extracted have a balmy eloquence. But then, alas, my heart! oh how shall I Cure thee of thy delightfull tympanie? I cannot hold, such a springtide of joy Must have a passage, or 'twill force a way. Yet shall my loyall tongue keepe this command: But give me leave to ease it with my hand. And though these humble lines soare not soe high, As is thy birth; yet from thy flaming eye Drop downe one sparke of glory, &amp; they'l prove A præsent worthy of Apollo's love. My quill to thee may not præsume to sing: Lett th'hallowed plume of a seraphick wing Bee consecrated to this worke, while I Chant to my selfe with rustick melodie. Rich, liberall heaven, what, hath yo? treasure store Of such bright Angells, that you give us more? Had you, like our great Sunne, stamped but one For earth, t'had beene an ample portion. Had you but drawne one lively coppy forth, That might interpret our faire Cynthia's worth, Y' had done enough to make the lazy ground Dance, like the nimble spheres, a joyfull round. But such is the cœlestiall Excellence, That in the princely patterne shines, from whence The rest pourtraicted are, that 'tis noe paine To ravish heaven to limbe them o're againe. Wittnesse this mapp of beauty; every part Of w?? doth show the Quintessence of art. See! nothing's vulgar, every atome heere Speakes the great wisdome of th'artificer. Poore Earth hath not enough perfection, To shaddow forth th'admirèd paragon. Those sparkling twinnes of light should I now stile Rich diamonds, sett in a pure silver foyle; Or call her cheeke a bed of new-blowne roses; And say that Ivory her front composes; Or should I say, that with a scarlet wave Those plumpe soft rubies had bin drest soe brave; Or that the dying lilly did bestow Upon her neck the whitest of his snow; Or that the purple violets did lace That hand of milky downe: all these are base; Her glories I should dimme with things soe grosse, And foule the cleare text with a muddy glosse. Goe on then, Heaven, &amp; limbe forth such another, Draw to this sister miracle a brother; Compile a first glorious Epitome Of heaven, &amp; earth, &amp; of all raritie; And sett it forth in the same happy place, And I'le not blurre it with my Paraphrase. EX EUPHORMIONE. O Dea syderei seu tu stirps alma Tonantis &amp;c. Bright Goddesse, (whether Jove thy father be; Or Jove a father will be made by thee) Oh crowne these praie'rs (mov'd in a happy hower) But with one cordiall smile for Cloe. that power Of Loue's all-daring hand, that makes me burne, Makes me confess't. Oh, doe not thou with scorne, Great Nymph, o'relooke my lownesse. heav'n you know And all their fellow Deities will bow Even to the naked'st vowes. thou art my fate; To thee the Parcæ have given up of late My threds of life. if then I shall not live By thee; by thee yet lett me die. this give, High beauties soveraigne, that my funerall flames May draw their first breath from thy starry beames. The Phœnix selfe shall not more proudly burne, That fetcheth fresh life from her fruitfull urne. An Elegy upon the Death of Mr. Stanninow, Fellow of Queenes Colledge. Hath aged winter, fledg'd with feathered raine, To frozen Caucasus his flight now tane? Doth hee in downy snow there closely shrowd His bedrid limmes, wrapt in a fleecy clowd? Is th'earth disrobed of her apron white, Kind winter's guift, &amp; in a greene one dight? Doth she beginne to dandle in her lappe Her painted infants, fedd with pleasant pappe, W?? their bright father in a pretious showre From heavens sweet milky streame doth gently powre? Doth blith Apollo cloath the heavens with joye, And with a golden wave wash cleane away Those durty smutches, w?? their faire fronts wore, And make them laugh, w?? frown'd, &amp; wept before? If heaven hath now forgot to weepe; ô then W? meane these showres of teares amongst us men? These Cataracts of griefe, that dare ev'n vie With th'richest clowds their pearly treasurie? If winters gone, whence this untimely cold, That on these snowy limmes hath laid such hold? What more than winter hath that dire art found, These purple currents hedg'd with violets round. To corrallize, w?? softly wont to slide In crimson waveletts, &amp; in scarlet tide? If Flora's darlings now awake from sleepe, And out of their greene mantletts dare to peepe: O tell me then, what rude outragious blast Forc't this prime flowre of youth to make such hast To hide his blooming glories, &amp; bequeath His balmy treasure to the bedd of death? 'Twas not the frozen zone; One sparke of fire, Shott from his flaming eye, had thaw'd it's ire, And made it burne in love: 'Twas not the rage, And too ungentle nippe of frosty age: 'Twas not the chast, &amp; purer snow, whose nest Was in the modest Nunnery of his brest: Noe. none of these ravish't those virgin roses, The Muses, &amp; the Graces fragrant posies. W??, while they smiling sate upon his face, They often kist, &amp; in the sugred place Left many a starry teare, to thinke how soone The golden harvest of our joyes, the noone Of all our glorious hopes should fade, And be eclipsed with an envious shade. Noe. 'twas old doting Death, who stealing by, Dragging his crooked burthen, look't awry, And streight his amorous syth (greedy of blisse) Murdred the earth's just pride with a rude kisse. A winged Herald, gladd of soe sweet a prey, Snatch't upp the falling starre, soe richly gay, And plants it in a precious perfum'd bedd, Amongst those Lillies, w?? his bosome bredd. Where round about hovers with silver wing A golden summer, an æternall spring. Now that his root such fruit againe may beare, Let each eye water't with a courteous teare. An Elegie on the death of Dr. Porter. Stay, silver-footed Came, strive not to wed Thy maiden streames soe soone to Neptunes bed: Fixe heere thy wat'ry eyes upon these towers, Unto whose feet in reverence of the powers, That there inhabite, thou on every day With trembling lippes an humble kisse do'st pay. See all in mourning now; the walles are jett, With pearly papers carelesly besett. Whose snowy cheekes, least joy should be exprest, The weeping pen with sable teares hath drest. Their wronged beauties speake a Tragœdy, Somewhat more horrid than an Elegy. Pure, &amp; unmixed cruelty they tell, W?? poseth mischeife's selfe to Parallel. Justice hath lost her hand, the law her head; Peace is an Orphan now; her father's dead. Honesties nurse, Vertues blest Guardian, That heavenly mortall, that Seraphick man. Enough is said, now, if thou canst crowd on Thy lazy crawling streames, pri'thee be gone, And murmur forth thy woes to every flower, That on thy bankes sitts in a verdant bower, And is instructed by thy glassy wave To paint its perfum'd face w?? colours brave. In vailes of dust their silken heads they'le hide, As if the oft departing sunne had dy'd. Goe learne that fatall Quire, soe sprucely dight In downy surplisses, &amp; vestments white, To sing their saddest Dirges, such as may Make their scar'd soules take wing, &amp; fly away. Lett thy swolne breast discharge thy strugling groanes To th'churlish rocks; &amp; teach the stubborne stones To melt in gentle drops, lett them be heard Of all proud Neptunes silver-sheilded guard; That greife may crack that string, &amp; now untie Their shackled tongues to chant an Elegie. Whisper thy plaints to th'Oceans curteous eares, Then weepe thyselfe into a sea of teares. A thousand Helicons the Muses send In a bright Christall tide, to thee they tend, Leaving those mines of Nectar, their sweet fountaines, They force a lilly path through rosy mountaines. Feare not to dy with greife; all bubling eyes Are teeming now with store of fresh supplies.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">[FROM BRITISH MUSEUM Additional MS. 33,219.] [At th'Ivory Tribunall of your hand] At th'Ivory Tribunall of your hand (Faire one) these tender leaves doe trembling stand. Knowing 'tis in the doome of your sweet Eye Whether the Muse they cloth shall live or die. Live shee, or dye to Fame; each Leafe you meet Is her Lifes wing, or her death's winding-sheet. Though now 'tis neither May nor June And Nightingales are out of tune, Yet in these leaves (Faire one) there lyes (Sworne servant to your sweetest Eyes) A Nightingale, who may shee spread In your white bosome her chast bed, Spite of all the Maiden snow Those pure untroden pathes can show, You streight shall see her wake and rise Taking fresh Life from your fayre Eyes. And with clasp't winges proclayme a Spring Where Love and shee shall sit and sing: For lodg'd so ne're your sweetest throte What Nightingale can loose her noate? Nor lett her kinred birds complayne Because shee breakes the yeares old raigne: For lett them know shee's none of those Hedge-Quiristers whose Musicke owes Onely such straynes as serve to keepe Sad shades and sing dull Night asleepe. No shee's a Priestesse of that Grove The holy chappell of chast Love Your Virgin bosome. Then what e're Poore Lawes divide the publicke yeare, Whose revolutions wait upon The wild turnes of the wanton Sun; Bee you the Lady of Loves Yeere: Where your Eyes shine his Suns appeare: There all the yeare is Loves long Spring. There all the year Loves Nightingales shall sitt and sing. Out of Grotius his Tragedy of Christes sufferinges. O thou the Span of whose Omnipotence Doth graspe the fate of thinges, and share th'events Of future chance! the world's grand Sire; and mine Before the world. Obedient lo! I joyne An æquall pace thus farre; thy word my deedes Have flow'd together. if ought further needes I shrinke not but thus ready stand to beare (ffor else why came I?) ev'n what e're I feare. Yett o what end? where does the period dwell Of my sad labours? no day yett could tell My soule shee was secure. Still have I borne A still increasing burden; worse hath torne His way through bad, to my successive hurt. I left my glorious Fathers star-pav'd Court E're borne was banish't; borne was glad t'embrace A poore (yea scarce a) roofe. whose narrow place Was not so much as cleane; a stable kind; The best my cradle and my birth could find. Then was I knowne; and knowne unluckily A weake a wretched child; ev'n then was I For Juryes king an enemy, even worth His feare; the circle of a yeares round growth Was not yett full, (a time that to my age Made litle, not a litle to his rage) When a wild sword ev'n from their brests, did lop The Mothers Joyes in an untimely crop. The search of one child (cruell industry!) Was losse of multitudes; and missing mee A bloud drunke errour spilt the costly ayme Of their mad sin; (how great! and yett how vayne!) I cal'd a hundred miracles to tell The world my father, then does envy swell And breake upon mee: my owne virtues height Hurtes mee far worse then Herods highest spite; A riddle! (father) still acknowledg'd thine Am still refus'd; before the Infant Shrine Of my weake feet the Persian Magi lay And left their Mithra for my star: this they. But Isaacks issue the peculiar heyres, Of thy old goodnesse, know thee not for theires, Basely degenerous. Against mee flocke The stiffe neck'd Pharisees that use to mocke Sound goodnesse with her shadow which they weare, And 'gainst religion her owne colours beare. The bloud hound brood of Priests against mee draw Those Lawlesse tyrant masters of the Law. Profane Sadocus too does fiercely lead His court-fed impes against this hated head. What would they more? th'ave seene when at my nod Great Natures selfe hath shrunke and spoke mee god. Drinke fayling there where I a guest did shine The water blush'd, and started into wine. Full of high sparkeling vigour: taught by mee A sweet inebriated extasy. And streight of all this approbation gate Good wine in all poynts. but the easy rate; Other mens hunger with strange feasts I quell'd: Mine owne with stranger fastings, when I held Twice twenty dayes pure abstinence, To feed My minds devotion in my bodyes need. A subtle inundation of quicke food Sprang in the spending fingers, and o'reflow'd The peoples hunger, and when all were full The broken meate was much more then the whole. The Wind in all his roaring brags stood still And listned to the whisper of my will; The wild waves couch'd; the sea forgott to sweat Under my feet, the waters to bee wett. In death-full desperate ills where art and all Was nothing, there my voyce was med'cinall. Old clouds of thickest blindnesse fled my sight And to my touch darke Eyes did owe the light. Hee that ne're heard now speakes, and finds a tongue To chaunt my prayses in a new-strung song. Even hee that belches out a foaming flood Of hot defiance 'gainst what e're is good Father and Heyre of darkenesse, when I chide Sinkes into Horrours bosome, glad to hide Himselfe in his owne hell; and now lets loose Mans brest (his tenement) and breakes up house. Yett here's not all: nor was't enough for mee To freind the living world even death did see Mee ranging in his quarters; and the land Of deepest silence answered my command. Heav'n, Earth, and Sea, my triumphs. what remain'd Now but the Grave? the Grave it selfe I tam'd. &amp;c: The End.</field>
