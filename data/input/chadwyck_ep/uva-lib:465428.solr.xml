      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. AN ESSAY ON PAINTING: IN TWO EPISTLES TO Mr. ROMNEY. Some notes have been omitted. ?????????? ???? ???? ????????? ????? ? ????? ??????????, ??? ????? ??? ?????? ????? ????????, —? ?????? ?? ??????? ?????? ????? ?? ?? ???????? ??????????. Philostratus. ?Patet omnibus Ars, nondum est occupata, multum ex illâ etiam futuris relictum est. Senec. Epist. 33. EPISTLE THE FIRST. ARGUMENT OF THE FIRST EPISTLE. Introduction—The flourishing state of Art in this country—Disadvantages attending the modern Painter of Portraits—Short encomium on this branch of Art, with the account of its origin in the story of the Maid of Corinth—Superiority of Historical Painting—Some account of the Greeks who excelled in it—Its destruction and revival in Italy—Short account of the most eminent Italian and Spanish Painters—Those of Flanders and France—The corruption of Art among the latter. Blest be the hour, when fav'ring gales restore The travell'd Artist to his native shore! His mind enlighten'd, and his fancy fraught With finest forms by ancient genius wrought; Whose magic beauty charm'd, with spell sublime, The scythe of Ruin from the hand of Time, And mov'd the mighty leveller to spare Models of grace so exquisitely fair. While you, whom Painting thus inspir'd to roam, Bring these rich stores of ripen'd judgment home; While now, attending my accomplish'd friend, Science and Taste his soften'd colours blend; Let the fond Muse, tho' with a transient view, The progress of her sister art pursue; Eager in tracing from remotest time The steps of Painting through each favour'd clime, To praise her dearest sons, whose daring aim Gain'd their bright stations on the heights of fame, And mark the paths by which her partial hand Conducts her Romney to this radiant band. Painting, sweet Nymph! now leaves in lifeless trance Exhausted Italy and tinsel France, And sees in Britain, with exulting eyes, Her vot'ries prosper, and her glories rise. Yet tho', my friend, thy art is thus carest, And with the homage of the public blest, And flourishes with growing beauty fair, The child of Majesty's adoptive care, The youthful artist still is doom'd to feel Obstruction's chilling hand, that damps his zeal: Th' imperious voice of Vanity and Pride Bids him from Fancy's region turn aside, And quit the magic of her scene, to trace The vacant lines of some unmeaning face: E'en in this work his wishes still are crost, And all the efforts of his art are lost; For when the canvas, with the mirror's truth, Reflects the perfect form of age or youth, The fond affections of the partial mind The eye of judgment with delusion blind: Each mother bids him brighter tints employ, And give new spirit to her booby boy; Nor can the painter, with his utmost art, Express the image in the lover's heart: Unconscious of the change the seasons bring, Autumnal beauty asks the rose of spring, And vain self-love, in every age the same, Will fondly urge some visionary claim. The luckless painter, destin'd to submit, Mourns the lost likeness which he once had hit, And, doom'd to groundless censure, bears alone The grievous load of errors not his own. Nor is it Pride, or Folly's vain command, That only fetters his creative hand; At Fashion's nod he copies as they pass Each quaint reflection from her crowded glass. The formal coat, with intersecting line, Mars the free graces of his fair design; The towering cap he marks with like distress, And all the motley mass of female dress. The hoop extended with enormous size, The corks that like a promontory rise; The stays of deadly steel, in whose embrace The tyrant Fashion tortures injur'd Grace. But Art, despairing over shapes like these To cast an air of elegance and ease, Invokes kind Fancy's aid—she comes to spread Her magic spells—the Gothic forms are fled; And see, to crown the painter's just desire, Her free positions, and her light attire! Th' ambitious artist wishes to pursue This brilliant plan with more extensive view, And with adopted character to give A lasting charm to make the portrait live; All points of art by one nice effort gain, Delight the learned, and content the vain; Make history to life new value lend, And in the comprehensive picture blend The ancient hero with the living friend. Most fair device! “but, ah! what foes to sense, What broods of motley monsters rise from hence!” The strange pretensions of each age and sex These plans of fancy and of taste perplex; For male and female, to themselves unknown, Demand a character unlike their own, Till oft the painter to this quaint distress Prefers the awkward shapes of common dress. Sweet girls, of mild and pensive softness, choose The sportive emblems of the comic Muse; And sprightly damsels are inclin'd to borrow The garb of penitence, and tears of sorrow: While awkward pride, tho' safe from war's alarms, Round his plump body buckles ancient arms, And, from an honest justice of the peace, Starts up at once a demi-god of Greece; Too firm of heart by ridicule to fall, The finish'd hero crowns his country hall, Ordain'd to fill, if fire his glory spare, The lumber-garret of his wiser heir. Not less absurd to flatter Nero's eyes Arose the portrait of colossal size: Twice fifty feet th' enormous sheet was spread, To lift o'er gazing slaves the monster's head, When impious Folly sway'd Oppression's rod, And servile Rome ador'd the mimic God. Think not, my friend, with supercilious air, I rank the portrait as beneath thy care. Blest be the pencil! which from death can save The semblance of the virtuous, wife, and brave; That youth and emulation still may gaze On those inspiring forms of ancient days, And, from the force of bright example bold, Rival their worth, “and be what they behold.” Blest be the pencil! whose consoling pow'r, Soothing soft Friendship in her pensive hour, Dispels the cloud, with melancholy fraught, That absence throws upon her tender thought. Blest be the pencil! whose enchantment gives To wounded Love the food on which he lives. Rich in this gift, tho' cruel ocean bear The youth to exile from his faithful fair, He in fond dreams hangs o'er her glowing cheek, Still owns her present, and still hears her speak: Oh! Love, it was thy glory to impart Its infant being to this magic art! Inspir'd by thee, the soft Corinthian maid Her graceful lover's sleeping form portray'd: Her boding heart his near departure knew, Yet long'd to keep his image in her view: Pleas'd she beheld the steady shadow fall, By the clear lamp upon the even wall: The line she trac'd with fond precision true, And, drawing, doated on the form she drew; Nor, as she glow'd with no forbidden fire, Conccal'd the simple picture from her sire: His kindred fancy, still to nature just, Copied her line, and form'd the mimic bust. Thus from thy power, inspiring Love, we trace The modell'd image, and the pencil'd face! We pity Genius, when, by interest led, His toils but reach the semblance of a head; Yet are those censures too severe and vain, That scorn the Portrait as the Painter's bane. Tho' up the mountain winds the arduous road That leads to pure Perfection's bright abode, In humbler walks some tempting laurels grow, Some flowers are gather'd in the vale below: Youth on the plain collects increasing force, To climb the steep in his meridian course. While Nature sees her living models share The rising artist's unremitting care, She on his mind her every charm imprints, Her easy postures, and her perfect tints, Till his quick pencil, in maturer hour, Becomes her rival in creative power. Yet in these paths disdain a long delay, While eager Genius points a nobler way: For see! expanding to thy raptur'd gaze, The epic field a brighter scene displays! Here stands the temple, where, to merit true, Fame gives her laurel to the favour'd few: Whose minds, illumin'd with cœlestial fire, Direct the pencil, or awake the lyre; Who trace the springs of nature to their source, And by her guidance, with resistless force, The tides of error and of transport roll Thro' every channel of the human soul! How few, my friend, tho' millions boast the aim, Leave in this temple an unclouded name! Vain the attempt, in every age and clime, Without the slow conductors toil and time; Without that secret, soul-impelling power, Infus'd by Genius in the natal hour; And vain with these, if bright occasion's ray Fail to illuminate the doubtful way. The elders of thy art ordain'd to stand In the first circle of this honour'd band, (Whose pencil, striving for the noblest praise, The heart to soften and the mind to raise, Gave life and manners to the finish'd piece) These sons of glory were the sons of Greece! Hail! throne of genius, hail! what mighty hand Form'd the bright offspring of this famous land? First in the annals of the world they shine: Such gifts, O Liberty, are only thine; Thy vital fires thro' kindling spirits run, Thou soul of life, thou intellectual sun; Thy rays call forth, profuse and unconfin'd, The richest produce of the human mind. First taught by thee, the Grecian pencil wrought The forceful lessons of exalted thought, And generously gave, at glory's call, The patriot picture to the public hall. 'Twas then Panæus drew, with freedom's train, The Chief of Marathon's immortal plain, In glorious triumph o'er the mighty host That Persia pour'd in torrents on their coast. There Polygnotus, scorning servile hire, Display'd th' embattled scene from Homer's lyre. His country view'd the gift with fond regard, And rank'd the painter with their noblest bard. Thy tragic pencil, Aristides, caught Each varied feeling, and each tender thought; While moral virtue sanctified thy art, And passion gave it empire o'er the heart. Correct Parrhasius first to rich design Gave nice proportion, and the melting line, Whose soft extremes from observation fly, And with ideal distance cheat the eye. The gay, the warm, licentious Zeuxis drew Voluptuous Beauty in her richest hue: Bade in one form her scatter'd rays unite, And charm'd the view with their collected light. But Grace consign'd, while her fair works he plann'd, Her softest pencil to Apelles' hand: Yet oft to gain sublimer heights he strove, Such strong expression mark'd his mimic Jove, Inimitably great he seem'd to tower, And pass the limits of the pencil's power. Ye sons of art, tho' on the gulph of years No floating relic of your toil appears, Yet glory shews, in every cultur'd clime, Your names still radiant thro' the clouds of time. Thy pride, O Rome, inclin'd thee to abhor Each work that call'd thee from thy sphere of war: By Freedom train'd, and favour'd by the Nine, The powers of eloquence and verse were thine, While chilling damps upon the pencil hung, Where Tully thunder'd and where Virgil sung, Yet Grecian artists had the splendid fate To triumph o'er the Romans' scornful hate. Their matchless works profusion toil'd to buy, Their wonders glitter'd in the public eye, Till Rome's terrific pomp, and letter'd pride, Were sunk in Desolation's whelming tide. Oh! lovely Painting! long thy cheering light Was lost and buried in barbaric night; The furious rage of Anarchy effac'd Each hallow'd character thy hand had trac'd, And Ign'rance, mutt'ring in her monkish cell, Bound thy free soul in her lethargic spell. At length from this long trance thy spirit rose, In that sweet vale where silver Arno flows; There studious Vinci treasur'd every rule, To form the basis of a rising school: Like early Hesiod, 'twas his fate to shine, The herald of a master more divine. Inflam'd by Genius with sublimest rage, By toil unwearied, and unchill'd by age, In the fine phrenzy of exalted thought Gigantic Angelo his wonders wrought; And high, by native strength of spirit rais'd, The mighty Homer of the pencil blaz'd. Taste, Fancy, Judgment, all on Raphael smil'd, Of Grandeur and of Grace the darling child: Truth, passion, character, his constant aim, Both in the human and the heavenly frame, Th' enchanting painter rules the willing heart, And shines the finish'd Virgil of his art. The daring Julio, tho' by Raphael train'd, Reach'd not the summit where his master reign'd; Yet to no common heights of epic fame True Genius guided his adventurous aim. Thus Statius, fraught with emulous regard, Caught not the spirit of the Mantuan bard: Tho' rival ardour his ambition fir'd, And kindred talents his bold verse inspir'd. More richly warm, the glowing Titian knew To blend with Nature's truth the living hue: O! had sublime design his colours crown'd! Then had the world a finish'd painter found: With powers to seize the highest branch of art, He fix'd too fondly on an humbler part; Yet this low object of his partial care Grew from his toil so exquisitely fair, That dazzled judgment, with suspended voice, Fears to condemn the error of his choice. Thus pleas'd a flowery valley to explore, Whence never Poet cull'd a wreath before, Unde prius nulli velarunt Tempora Musæ. Lucretius, Lib. iv. Ver. 5. Lucretius chose the epic crown to lose For the bright chaplets of an humbler muse. Soft as Catullus, sweet Corregio play'd With all the magic charms of light and shade. Tho' Parma claim it for her rival son, The praise of sweetest grace thy pencil won: Unhappy Genius! tho' of skill divine, Unjust neglect and penury were thine. Lamenting o'er thy labours unrepaid, Afflicted Art opprest with wrongs decay'd, Till with pure judgment the Caracci came, And, raising her weak powers and sinking frame, Reclaim'd the pencil of misguided youth From Affectation's glare to tints of modest Truth. They form'd the Pencil, to whose infant fame Young Zampieri ow'd his nobler name: Profoundly skill'd his figures to dispose, The learned Lanfranc in their school arose, And, train'd to glory, by their forming care, The tender Guido caught his graceful air. Nor shall ye fail your well-earn'd praise to gain, Ye! who adorn'd with art your native Spain! The unfrequented shore, that gave you birth, Tempts not the faithful Muse to hide your worth: Just to all regions, let her voice proclaim Titian's mute scholar, rival of his fame. The power, that Nature to his lips denied, Indulgent Art, with fonder care, supplied: The cruel bar his happy genius broke; Tho' dumb the painter, all his pictures spoke. And thou, Velasquez, share the honour due To forceful tints, that fascinate the view! Thy bold illusive talents soar'd so high, They mock'd, with mimic life, the cheated eye. Thou liberal artist! 'twas thy praise to guide Thy happy scholar with parental pride; Thy care the soft, the rich Murillo form'd, And, as thy precept taught, thy friendship warm'd. Yet other names, and not a scanty band! Have added lustre to th' Iberian land; But generous Italy, thy genial earth Superior numbers bore of splendid worth! And rais'd amidst them, in thy golden days, No mean historian to record their praise. On Thee, whom Art, thy patroness and pride, Taught both the pencil and the pen to guide; Whose generous zeal and modest truth have known To blazon others' skill, not boast thy own; On thee, Vasari, let my verse bestow That just applause, so freely seen to flow From thy ingenuous heart and liberal hand, To each great artist of thy native land! Tho' many shine in thy elaborate page, And more have risen since thy distant age, Their various talents, and their different fame, The Muse, unskilful, must decline to name, Lest in the nice attempt her judgment fail To poise their merits in Precision's scale. E'en public Taste, by no determin'd rule, Has class'd the merit of each nobler school: To Rome and Florence, in Expression strong, The highest honours of Design belong; On her pure Style see mild Bologna claim Her fairest right to secondary fame; Tho' prouder Venice would usurp that praise, Upon the splendid force of Titian's golden rays. But ill they know the value of their art, Who, flattering the eye, neglect the heart. Tho' matchless tints a lasting name secure, Tho' strong the magic of the clear-obscure, These must submit, as a dependant part, To pure Design, the very soul of Art; Or Fame, misguided, must invert her course, And Raphael's Grace must yield to Rembrandt's Force; Fancy's bold thought to Labour's patient touch, And Rome's exalted genius to the Dutch. Yet, Holland, thy unwearied labours raise A perfect title to peculiar praise: Thy hum'rous pencil shuns the epic field, The blazing falchion, and the sanguine shield; But hap'ly marks the group of rural Mirth, In social circle round the chearful hearth; And rustic Joy, from busy cares releas'd, To the gay gambols of the village feast: While Nature smiles her very faults to view, Trac'd with a skill so exquisitely true. These faults, O Rembrandt, 'twas thy praise to hide! New pow'rs of Art thy fertile mind supplied; With dazzling force thy gorgeous colouring glows, And o'er each scene an air of grandeur throws: The meanest Figures dignity assume, From thy contrasted light, and magic gloom. These strong illusions are supremely thine, And laugh at Imitation's vague design: So near to blemishes thy beauties run, Those who affect thy splendor are undone: While thy rash rivals, loose and incorrect, Miscall their shadowy want of truth Effect, And into paths of affectation start: Neglect of Nature is the bane of Art. Proud of the praise by Rubens' pencil won, Let Flanders boast her bold inventive son! Whose glowing hues magnificently shine With warmth congenial to his rich design: And him, her second pride, whose milder care From living Beauty caught its loveliest air! Who truth of character with grace combin'd, And in the speaking feature mark'd the mind, Her soft Vandyke, while graceful portraits please, Shall reign the model of unrivall'd ease. Painting shall tell, with many a grateful thought, From Flanders first the secret pow'r she caught, To grace and guard the offspring of her toil, With all the virtues of enduring oil; Tho' charm'd by Italy's alluring views, (Where sumptuous Leo courted every Muse, And lovely Science grew the public care) She fix'd the glories of her empire there; There in her zenith soon she ceas'd to shine, And dated, passing her meridan line, From the Caracci's death her period of decline. Yet in her gloomy and disgraceful hour Of faded beauty, and enfeebled power, With talents flowing in free Nature's course, With just exertion of unborrow'd force, Untrodden paths of art Salvator tried, And daring Fancy was his favourite guide. O'er his wild rocks, at her command, he throws A savage grandeur, and sublime repose; Or gives th' historic scene a charm as strong As the terrific gloom of Dante's song. His bold ideas, unrefin'd by taste, Express'd with vigour, tho' conceiv'd in haste, Before slow judgment their defects can find, With awful pleasure fill the passive mind. Nor could one art, with various beauty fraught, Engross the ardor of his active thought: His pencil pausing, with satiric fire He struck the chords of the congenial lyre; By generous verse attempting to reclaim The meaner artist from each abject aim. But vain his satire! his example vain! Degraded Painting sinks with many a stain: Her clouded beams, from Italy withdrawn, On colder France with transient lustre dawn. There, in the arms of Roman science nurs'd, In every work of ancient genius vers'd, The sage Poussin, with purest fancy fraught, Portray'd the classic scene, as Learning taught: But Nature, jealous of her sacred right, And piqu'd that his idolatry should slight Her glowing graces, and her living air, To worship marble with a fonder care, Denied his pencil, in its mimic strife, The bloom of beauty, and the warmth of life. Then rose Le Brun, his scholar, and his friend, More justly skill'd the vivid tints to blend; Tho' with exalted spirit he present The generous victor in the suppliant tent, Too oft the genius of his gaudy clime Misled his pencil from the pure sublime. Thy dawn, Le Sueur, announc'd a happier taste, With fancy glowing, and with judgment chaste: But Art, who gloried in thy rising bloom, Shed fruitless tears upon thy early tomb. These lights withdrawn, Confusion and Misrule Seize the vain pencil of the Gallic school: Tho' Fresnoy teaches, in Horatian song, The laws and limits that to Art belong; In vain he strives, with Attic judgment chaste, To crush the monsters of corrupted taste: With ineffectual fire the poet sings, Prolific still the wounded Hydra springs: Gods roll'd on gods encumber every hall, And saints, convulsive, o'er the chapel sprawl. Bombast is Grandeur, Affectation Grace, Beauty's soft smile is turn'd to pert grimace; Loaded with dress, supremely fine advance Old Homer's heroes, with the airs of France. Indignant Art disclaim'd the motley crew, Resign'd their empire, and to Britain flew. END OF THE FIRST EPISTLE. EPISTLE THE SECOND. ARGUMENT OF THE SECOND EPISTLE. The rise of Painting in England, and the reasons for its happening so late.—The rapidity of its improvement. —A slight sketch of the most eminent living Artists in England.—The author's wish to see his friend among the first of that number—His reasons for hoping it. —The reputation of a Painter in some degree owing to a happy choice of subjects—A few recommended from national events—and from Milton and Shakespeare. —Conclusion.—Author's wishes for his friend's success. Ingenuous Romney, whom thy merits raise To the pure summits of unclouded praise; Whom Art has chosen, with successful hand, To spread her empire o'er this honour'd land; Thy Progress Friendship with delight surveys, And this pure Homage to thy Goddess pays. Hail! heavenly Visitant! whose cheering powers E'en to the happy give still happier hours! O! next to Freedom, and the Muse, design'd To raise, ennoble, and adorn mankind! At length we view thee in this favor'd Isle, That greets thy presence, and deserves thy smile: This favor'd Isle, in native Freedom bold, And rich in Spirit as thy Greeks of old. Tho' foreign Theorists, with System blind, Prescribe false limits to the British mind, And, warp'd by Vanity, presume to hold Our northern Genius dark, confin'd, and cold: Painting, sweet Nymph, unconscious of their chain, In this fair Island forms her new Domain, And freely gives to Britain's eager view Those charms which once her fav'rite Athens knew. 'Tis true, when Painting, on Italia's shore, Display'd those Graces which all Realms adore, No kindred forms of English growth appear; Age after age the hapless Pencil here Dropt unsuccessful from the Native's hand, And fail'd to decorate this darker Land. But freely let impartial History say, Why Art on Britain shone with later ray. When on this Isle, the Gothic clouds withdrawn, The distant light of Painting seem'd to dawn, Fierce Harry reign'd, who, soon with pleasure cloy'd, Now lov'd, now scorn'd, now worshipp'd, now destroy'd. Thee as his Wives, enchanting Art! he priz'd, Now sought to crown thee, now thy death devis'd: Now strove to fix, with liberal support, Thy darling Raphael in his sumptuous Court; Now o'er the hallow'd shrines thy hand had grac'd, “Cried havock, and let slip the Dogs of Waste.” When timid Art saw ruin his delight, She fled in terror from the Tyrant's sight. The Virgin Queen, whom dazzled eyes admire, The subtle Child of this imperious Sire, Untaught the moral force of Art to feel, Proscrib'd it as the slave of bigot Zeal; Or doom'd it, throwing nobler works aside, To drudge in flatt'ring her fantastic Pride: And hence the Epic pencil in the shade Of blank neglect and cold obstruction laid, E'en while the Fairy-sprite, and Muse of fire, Hung high in Glory's hall the English lyre. James, both for Empire and for Arts unfit, (His sense a quibble, and a pun his wit) Whatever works he patroniz'd debas'd, But haply left the Pencil undisgrac'd. With fairer mind arose his nobler Son, Seduc'd by Parasites, by Priests undone: Unhappy Charles! oh! had thy feeling heart But honour'd Freedom as it valued Art! To merit just, thy bounty flow'd alike On bolder Rubens, and the soft Vandyke: To this ennobled realm thy judgment brought The sacred miracles that Raphael wrought. But regal Pride, with vain Ambition blind, Cut off the promise of thy cultur'd mind. By wounded Liberty's convulsive hand Unbound, fierce Anarchy usurps the Land; While trembling Art to foreign regions flies, To seek a refuge in serener skies. These storms subsiding, see her once again Returning in the second Charles's train! She comes to copy, in licentious sport, The Minions of a loose luxurious Court; From whence the modest Graces turn their eyes, Where Genius sees, and o'er the prospect sighs, Lely's soft tints, and Dryden's nobler Lyre, Made the mean Slaves of dissolute Desire. Once more, alarm'd by War's terrific roar, The sweet Enchantress quits the troubled shore; While sacred Freedom, darting in disdain Her vengeful Thunder on th' apostate Train, And, pleas'd the gloomy Tyrant to disown, Gives to Nassau the abdicated Throne. The peaceful Prince may rising Art defend, And Art shall crown her Patron and her Friend. In tumults, from the cradle to the grave, 'Tis thine, O William! sinking realms to save. To thee no leisure mightier cares allow, To bind the laurel on the Artist's brow: 'Tis thine to fix, with tutelary hand, The Base of Freedom, on which Art must stand. Yet to thy Palace Kneller's skill supplied Its richest ornament in Beauty's pride. Unhappy Kneller! covetous though vain; Thee Glory yielded to seducing Gain: While partial Taste from modest Riley turn'd, By diffidence depriv'd of praise well earn'd. Tho' in succeeding years the Muses taught, “How Ann commanded, and how Marlbro' fought;” And Thornhill's blaze of Allegory gilt The piles, that Wren's superior genius built; Contending Factions, in her closing reign, Like winds imprison'd, shook fair Freedom's Fane. Painting, soft timid Nymph, still chose to roam, And fear'd to settle in this shaking Dome. At length, the fury of each storm o'erblown, That threaten'd Brunswick's race on Britain's throne, Rebellion vanquish'd on her native shore, Her clans extinguish'd, and her chiefs no more: The youthful Noble, on a princely Plan, Encourag'd infant Art, and first began Before the studious eye of Youth to place The ancient Models of ideal Grace. When Britain triumph'd, thro' her wide domain, O'er France, supported by imperious Spain, And, sated with her Laurels' large increase, Began to cultivate the plants of Peace; Fixt by kind Majesty's protecting hand, Painting, no more an alien in our land, First smil'd to see, on this propitious ground, Her temples open'd, and her altars crown'd: And Grace, the first attendant of her train, She whom Apelles wooed, nor wooed in vain, To Reynolds gives her undulating line, And Judgment doats upon his chaste design. Tho' Envy whispers in the ear of Spleen, What thoughts are borrow'd in his perfect scene, With glee she marks them on her canker'd scroll, Malicious Fiend! 'twas thus that Virgil stole, To the bright Image gave a brighter Gloss, Or turn'd to purest Gold the foreign Dross. Excelling Artist! long delight the eye! Teach but thy transient tints no more to fly, Britain shall then her own Apelles see, And all the Grecian shall revive in thee. Thy manly spirit glories to impart The leading Principles of lib'ral Art; To youthful Genius points what course to run, What Lights to follow, and what Rocks to shun: So Orpheus taught, by Learning's heavenly sway, To daring Argonauts their doubtful way, And mark'd, to guide them in their bold Career, Th' unerring Glories of the starry Sphere. Thy Hand enforces what thy Precept taught, And gives new lessons of exalted thought; Thy nervous Pencil on the canvass throws The tragic story of sublimest woes: The wretched Sons, whom Grief and Famine tear, The Parent petrified with blank Despair, Thy Ugolino gives the heart to thrill With Pity's tender throbs, and Horror's icy chill. The offspring now of many a rival hand, Sublimity and Grace adorn the Land; Tho' but some few years past, this barren coast Scarce one fair grain of native Art could boast. Of various form, where'er we turn our eyes, With strong and rapid growth new wonders rise; Like seeds that Mariners, with generous toil, Have wisely carried to some kindred soil, Which, shooting quick and vig'rous in their birth, Speak the fond bounty of the virgin Earth: The land o'erjoy'd a fairer fruit to see, Adopts, with glad surprize, the alien Tree. Now Art exults, with annual Triumphs gay, And Britain glories in her rich display; Merit, who unassisted, and unknown, Late o'er his unseen labours sigh'd alone, Sees honour now his happier toils attend, And in the generous Public finds a friend. O lovely Painting, to whose charms I bow, “And breathe my willing verse with suppliant vow,” Forgive me, if by undiscerning Praise, Or groundless Censure, which false Judgment sways, My failing line with faint resemblance wrong Thy Sons, the subject of no envious song! Supremely skill'd the varied group to place, And range the crowded scene with easy grace; To finish parts, yet not impair the whole, But on th' impassion'd action fix the soul; Thro' wandering throngs the patriot Chief to guide, The shame of Carthage, as of Rome the pride; Or, while the bleeding Victor yields his breath, Give the bright lesson of heroic Death. Such are thy Merits, West: by Virtue's hand Built on the human heart thy praise shall stand, While dear to Glory, in her guardian Fane, The names of Regulus and Wolfe remain. With kindred power a rival hand succeeds, For whose just fame expiring Chatham pleads; Like Chatham's language, luminous and bold, Thy colours, Copley, the dread scene unfold, Where that prime Spirit, by whose guidance hurl'd, Britain's avenging thunder aw'd the world, In patriot cares employ'd his parting breath, Struck in his field of Civic fame by Death; And Freedom, happy in the tribute paid By Art and Genius to so dear a Shade, Shall own, the measure of thy praise to fill, The awful subject equall'd by thy skill. To Dance's pencil, in Precision strong, Transcendant Force, and Truth of Line belong, Not Garrick's self, to Shakespeare's spirit true, Display'd that spirit clearer to our view, Than Dance expresses, in its fiercest flame, The Poet's Genius in the Actor's Frame. From Garrick's features, with distraction fraught, He copies every trace of troubled thought; And paints, while back the waves of Battle roll, The Storm of sanguinary Richard's soul. The rapid Mortimer, of Spirit wild, Imagination's dear and daring Child, Marks the fierce Ruffian, in the Dungeon's gloom, Stung with remorse, and shudd'ring at his doom. Yet still to nobler heights his Genius springs, And paints a lesson to tyrannic Kings: In his bright colours see the field appear To Freedom sacred, and to Glory dear, Where John, proud Monarch, baffled on his throne, Hears the brave Chief his lawless pow'r disown, And, for an injur'd Nation, nobly claim The glorious Charter of immortal Fame! But see far off the modest Wright retire! Alone he rules his Element of Fire: Like Meteors darting through the gloom of Night, His sparkles flash upon the dazzled sight; Our eyes with momentary anguish smart, And Nature trembles at the power of Art. May thy bold colours, claiming endless praise, For ages shine with undiminish'd blaze, And when the fierce Vesuvio burns no more, May his red deluge down thy canvass pour! Art with no common gifts her Gainsb'rough grac'd, Two different Pencils in his hand she plac'd; This shall command, she said, with certain aim, A perfect Semblance of the human Frame; This, lightly sporting on the village-green, Paint the wild beauties of the rural Scene. In storms sublime the daring Wilson soars, And on the blasted Oak his mimic Lightning pours: Apollo triumphs in his flaming skies, And classic Beauties in his scenes arise. Thy Graces, Humphreys, and thy Colours clear, From Miniature's small circle disappear: May their distinguish'd merit still prevail, And shine with lustre on the larger Scale. Let candid Justice our attention lead To the soft Crayon of the graceful Read: Nor, Gard'ner, shall the Muse, in haste, forget Thy Taste and Ease; tho' with a fond regret She pays, while here the Crayon's pow'r she notes, A sigh of homage to the Shade of Coates. Nor, if her favour'd hand may hope to shed The flowers of glory o'er the skilful dead, Thy Talents, Hogarth! will she leave unsung; Charm of all eyes, and Theme of every tongue! A separate province 'twas thy praise to rule; Self-form'd thy Pencil! yet thy works a School; Where strongly painted, in gradations nice, The Pomp of Folly, and the Shame of Vice, Reach'd thro' the laughing Eye the mended Mind, And moral Humour sportive Art refin'd. While fleeting Manners, as minutely shewn As the clear prospect on the mirror thrown; While Truth of Character, exactly hit, And drest in all the dyes of comic wit; While these, in Fielding's page, delight supply, So long thy Pencil with his Pen shall vie. Science with grief beheld thy drooping age Fall the sad victim of a Poet's rage: But Wit's vindictive spleen, that mocks controul, Nature's high tax on luxury of soul! This, both in Bards and Painters, Fame forgives; Their Frailty's buried, but their Genius lives. Still many a Painter, not of humble Name, Appears the tribute of applause to claim; Some alien Artists, more of English Race, With fair Angelica, our foreign Grace, Who paints, with Energy and Softness join'd, The fond Emotions of the female Mind; And Cipriani, whom the Loves surround, And sportive Nymphs in Beauty's Cestus bound: For him those Nymphs their every Charm display, For him coy Venus throws her veil away; And Zaffani, whose faithful colours give The transient glories of the Stage to live; On his bright canvass each dramatic Muse A perfect copy of her scene reviews; Each, while those scenes her lost delight restore, Almost forgets her Garrick is no more.— O'er these I pass reluctant, lest too long The Muse diffusely spin a tedious Song. Yet one short pause, ye Pow'rs of Verse, allow To cull a Myrtle Leaf for Meyers's Brow! Tho' small its Field, thy Pencil may presume To ask a Wreath where Flowers immortal bloom. As Nature's self, in all her pictures fair, Colours her Infect works with nicest care, Nor better forms, to please the curious eye, The spotted Leopard than the gilded Fly; So thy fine Pencil, in its narrow space, Pours the full portion of uninjur'd Grace, And Portraits, true to Nature's larger line, Boast not an air more exquisite than thine. Soft Beauty's charms thy happiest works express, Beauty thy model and thy Patroness. For her thy care has to perfection brought Th' uncertain toil, with anxious trouble fraught; Thy colour'd Crystal, at her fond desire, Draws deathless Lustre from the dang'rous Fire, And, pleas'd to gaze on its immortal charm, She binds thy Bracelet on her snowy arm. While Admiration views, with raptur'd eye, These Lights of Art that gild the British sky; Oh! may my Friend arise, with lustre clear, And add new Glory to this radiant Sphere. This wish, my Romney, from the purest source, Has Reason's Warrant, join'd to Friendship's Force. For Genius breath'd into thy infant Frame The vital Spirit of his sacred Flame, Which frequent mists of Diffidence o'ercloud, Proving the vigor of the Sun they shroud. Nature in thee her every gift combin'd, Which forms the Artist of the noblest kind; That fond Ambition, which bestows on Art Each talent of the Mind, and passion of the Heart; That dauntless Patience, which all toil defies, Nor feels the labour while it views the prize. Enlight'ning Study, with maturing pow'r, From these fair seeds has call'd the op'ning flow'r; Thy just, thy graceful Portraits charm the view, With every tender tint that Titian knew. Round Fancy's circle when thy Pencil flies, With what terrific pomp thy Spectres rise! What lust of mischief marks thy Witch's form, While on the Lapland Rock she swells the storm! Tho' led by Fancy thro' her boundless reign, Well dost thou know to quit her wild domain, When History bids thee paint, severely chaste, Her simpler scene, with uncorrupted taste. While in these fields thy judging eyes explore, What spot untried may yield its secret ore, Thy happy Genius springs a virgin Mine Of copious, pure, original Design; Truth gives it value, and, distinctly bold, The stamp of Character compleats thy Gold. Thy Figures rise in Beauty's noblest scale, Sublimely telling their heroic Tale. Still may thy Powers in full exertion blaze, And Time revere them with unrivall'd praise! May Art, in honour of a Son like thee, So justly daring, with a soul so free, Each separate Province to thy care commend, And all her Glories in thy Pencil blend! May tender Titian's mellow softness join, With mighty Angelo's sublimer Line; Corregio's Grace with Raphael's Taste unite, And in thy perfect Works inchant the ravish'd Sight! How oft we find that when, with noblest aim, The glowing Artist gains the heights of Fame, To the well-chosen Theme he chiefly owes That praise which Judgment with delight bestows! The Lyre and Pencil both this Truth confess, The happy Subject forms their full success. Hard is the Painter's fate, when, wisely taught To trace with ease the deepest lines of thought, By hapless Fortune he is doom'd to rove Thro' all the frolicks of licentious Jove, That some dark Philip, phlegmatic and cold, (Whose needy Titian calls for ill-paid gold) May with voluptuous Images enflame The fated Passions of his languid frame. Abuse like this awakens generous Pain, And just Derision mingles with Disdain, When such a Pencil, in a Roman hand, While the rich Abbess issues her command, Makes wild St. Francis on the canvass sprawl, That some warm Nun in mimic trance may fall, Or, fondly gazing on the pious whim, Feel faintly Love o'erload each lazy limb, Mistaking, in the Cloister's dull embrace, The Cry of Nature for the Call of Grace. But see th' historic Muse before thee stand, Her nobler subjects court thy happier Hand! Her Forms of reverend Age, of graceful Youth, Of public Virtue, and of private Truth: The sacred power of injur'd Beauty's charms, And Freedom, fierce in adamantine Arms: Whence Sympathy, thro' thy assisting art, With floods of Joy may fill the human heart. But while the bounds of Hist'ry you explore, And bring new Treasures from her farthest shore, Thro' all her various fields, tho' large and wide, Still make Simplicity thy constant guide: And most, my Friend, a Syren's wiles beware, Ah! shun insidious Allegory's snare! Her Flattery offers an alluring wreath, Fair to the eye, but poisons lurk beneath, By which, too lightly tempted from his guard, Full many a Painter dies, and many a Bard. How sweet her voice, how dangerous her spell, Let Spenser's Knights, and Rubens' Tritons tell; Judgment at colour'd riddles shakes his head, And fairy Songs are prais'd, but little read; Where, in the Maze of her unbounded Sphere, Unbridled Fancy runs her wild Career. In Realms where Superstition's tyrant sway “Takes half the vigour of the soul away,” Let Art for subjects the dark Legend search, Where Saints unnumber'd people every Church; Let Painters run the wilds of Ovid o'er, To hunt for monsters which we heed no more. But here, my Romney, where, on Freedom's wings, The towering Spirit to Perfection springs; Where Genius, proud to act as Heav'n inspires, On Taste's pure Altars lights his facred fires; Oh! here let Painting, as of old in Greece, With patriot passions warm the finish'd piece; Let Britain, happy in a gen'rous race, Of manly Spirit, and of female Grace; Let this frank Parent with fond eyes explore Some just memorials of the line she bore, In tints immortal to her view recall Her dearest Offspring on the storied Wall. But some there are, who, with pedantic scorn, Despise the Hero, if in Britain born: For them Perfection has herself no charms, Without a Roman robe, or Grecian arms: Our slighted Country, for whose fame they feel No generous interest, no manly zeal, Sees public Judgment their false Taste arraign, And treat their cold contempt with due disdain; To the fair Annals of our Isle we trust, To prove this patriot indignation just, And, nobly partial to our native earth, Bid English Pencils honour English Worth. Shall Bayard, glorious in his dying hour, Of Gallic Chivalry the fairest Flow'r, Shall his pure Blood in British colours flow, And Britain, on her canvass, fail to shew Her wounded Sidney, Bayard's perfect peer, Sidney, her Knight, without Reproach or Fear, O'er whose pale corse heroic Worth should bend, And mild Humanity embalm her Friend! Oh! Romney, in his hour of Death we find A Subject worthy of thy feeling Mind; Methinks I see thy rapid Hand display The field of Zutphen, on that fatal day, When arm'd for Freedom, 'gainst the guilt of Spain, The Hero bled upon the Belgic plain! In that great moment thou hast caught the Chief, When pitying Friends supply the wish'd relief; While Sickness, Pain, and Thirst his pow'r subdue, I see the draught he pants for in his view: Near him the Soldier, that expiring lies, This precious Water views with ghastly eyes, With eyes that from their sockets seem to burst, With eager, frantic, agonizing Thirst: I see the Hero give, oh! generous Care! The Cup untasted to this silent Pray'r: I hear him say, with Tenderness divine, “Thy strong Necessity surpasses mine.” Shall Roman Charity for ever share Thro' every various School each Painter's Care? And Britain still her bright examples hide Of female Glory, and of filial Pride? Instruct our eyes, my Romney, to adore Th' heroic Daughter of the virtuous More, Resolv'd to save, or in th' attempt expire, The precious relicks of her martyr'd Sire: Before the cruel Council let her stand, Press the dear ghastly Head with pitying Hand, And plead, while Bigotry itself grows mild, The sacred duties of a grateful Child. Forgive the Muse, if haply she commend A Theme ill-chosen to her skilful Friend; She, tho' its pow'r commands her willing heart, Knows not the limits of thy lovely Art, Yet boldly owns an eager wish to see Her darling Images adorn'd by thee. Nor shall her social Love in silence hide The just emotions of her grateful Pride, When thy quick Pencil pours upon her sight Her own Creation in a fairer light; When her Serena learns from thee to live, And please by every charm that life can give. Thou hast imparted to th' ideal Fair Yet more than Beauty's bloom, and Youth's attractive air; For in thy studious Nymph th' enamour'd Eye May, thro' her breast, her gentle Heart descry; See the fond thoughts, that o'er her Fancy roll, And Sympathy's soft swell, that fills her soul. But happier Bards, who boast a higher claim, Ask from thy Genius an increase of Fame. Oh! let the Sisters, who, with friendly aid, The Grecian Lyre, and Grecian Pencil sway'd, Who join'd their rival Powers with fond delight, To grace each other with reflected Light, Let them in Britain thus united reign, And double lustre from that union gain! Not that my Verse, adventurous, would pretend To point each varied subject to my Friend; Far nobler guides their better aid supply: When mighty Shakespeare to thy judging eye Presents that magic Glass, whose ample Round Reflects each Figure in Creation's bound, And pours, in floods of supernatural light, Fancy's bright Beings on the charmed sight. This chief Inchanter of the willing breast, Will teach thee all the magic he possest. Plac'd in his Circle, mark in colours true Each brilliant Being that he calls to view. Wrapt in the gloomy storm, or rob'd in light, His weïrd Sister or his fairy Sprite, Boldly o'erleaping, in the great design, The bounds of Nature, with a Guide divine. Let Milton's self, conductor of thy way, Lead thy congenial spirit to portray In Colours, like his Verse, sublimely strong, The scenes that blaze in his immortal song. See Michael drawn, by many a skilful Hand, As suits the Leader of the Seraph-Band! But oh! how poor the prostrate Satan lies, With bestial form debas'd and goatish eyes! How chang'd from him who leads the dire debate, Fearless tho' fallen, and in Ruin great! Let thy bold Pencil, more sublimely true, Present his Arch Apostate to our view In worthier Semblance of infernal Pow'r, And proudly standing like a stately tow'r, While his infernal mandate bids awake His Legions, slumbering on the burning Lake. Or paint him falling from the Realms of Bliss, Hurl'd in Combustion to the deep Abyss! In light terrific let the Flash display His Pride, still proof against almighty Sway: Tho' vanquish'd, yet immortal, let his Eye The Lightning's flame, the Thunder's bolt defy, And still, with Looks of Execration, dare To face the Horrors of the last Despair. To these great Lords of Fancy's wide domain, That o'er the human Soul unquestion'd reign, To their superior Guidance be consign'd Thy rival Pencil and congenial Mind. Yet O! let Friendship, ere the Verse she close, Which in just Tribute to thy Merit flows, The sanguine wishes of her heart express, With fond presages of thy full Success. May Health and Joy, in happiest union join'd, Breathe their warm Spirit o'er thy fruitful Mind! To noblest Efforts raise thy glowing Heart, And string thy sinews to the toils of Art! May Independance, bursting Fashion's chain, To eager Genius give the flowing rein, And o'er thy epic Canvass smile to see Thy Judgment active, and thy Fancy free! May thy just Country, while thy bold design Recalls the Heroes of her ancient Line, Gaze on the martial Group with dear delight! May Youth and Valour, kindling at the sight, O'er the bright Tints with Admiration lean, And catch new Virtue from the moral Scene! May Time himself a fond Reluctance feel, Nor from thy aged hand the Pencil steal, But grant it still to gain increasing Praise, In the late Period of thy lengthen'd days, While fairest Fortune thy long Life endears, With Raphael's Glory join'd to Titian's Years! END OF THE SECOND EPISTLE. EPISTLE TO A FRIEND, ON THE DEATH OF JOHN THORNTON, Esq. CUJUS EGO INTERITU TOTA DE MENTE FUGAVI HÆC STUDIA, ATQUE OMNES DELICIAS ANIMI. NOTESCATQUE MAGIS MORTUUS ATQUE MAGIS. Catullus. In vain, dear Monitor, thy kind desire To wake the embers of poetic fire! To clear the mind, where Grief's dark shadows lower, And Fancy dies by Sorrow's freezing power! In vain would Friendship's chearing voice suggest Her flattering visions to the Poet's breast; That public favor calls, with just demand, Th' expected volume from his lingering hand: Lost are those anxious hopes, that eager pride; With thee, my Thornton, they declin'd, they died. Friend of my opening soul! whose love began To hail thy Poet, ere he rank'd as man! Whose praise, like dew-drops which the early morn Sheds with mild virtue on the vernal thorn, Taught his young mind each swell of thought to show, And gave the germs of fancy strength to blow! Dear, firm associate of his studious hour, Who led his idler step to Learning's bower! Tho' young, imparting to his giddier youth Thy thirst of science, and thy zeal for truth! Ye towers of Granta, where our friendship grew, And that pure mind expanded to my view, Our love fraternal let your walls attest, Where Attic joys our letter'd evening blest; Where midnight, from the chains of sleep reliev'd, Stole on our social studies unperceiv'd! But not, my Thornton! in that calm alone Was thy mild genius, thy warm virtue known: When manhood mark'd the hour for busy strife, And led us to the crowded maze of life, Where honours dearly bought, and golden spoil, Tempt not the careless Bard who shrinks from toil, And whence to sweet retirement's soothing shade, Love and the Muse thy willing friend convey'd; Thy foul, more firm to join the struggling crowd, To nobler Themis toilsome homage vow'd, With zeal, devoting to her facred throne A heart as uncorrupted as her own. Still as thy mind, with manly powers endued, The opening path of active life pursued, And round the ripening field of business rang'd, Thy heart, unwarp'd, unharden'd, unestrang'd, To early friendship still retain'd its truth, With all the warm integrity of youth. Whene'er affliction's force thy friend opprest, Thou wert the rock on which his cares might rest; From thy kind words his rising hopes would own The charm of reason in affection's tone. Where is the soothing voice of equal power, To take its anguish from the present hour? Beneath the pressure of a grief so just, The lenient aid of books in vain I trust: They, that could once the war of thought controul, And banish discord from the jarring soul, Now irritate the mind they us'd to heal, They speak too loudly of the loss I feel. Thou faithful censor of the Poet's strain, No more shalt thou his sinking hope sustain, No more, with ardent zeal's enlivening fire, Call from inglorious shades his silent lyre: No more, as in our days of pleasure past, The eye of judgment o'er his labours cast; Keen to discern the blemishes, that lurk In the loose texture of his growing work; Eager to praise, yet resolute to blame, Kind to his verse, but kinder to his fame. How may the Muse, who prosper'd by thy care, Now meet the public eye without despair? Now, if harsh censures on her failings pour, Her warmest advocate can speak no more: Cold are those lips, which breath'd the kind defence, If spleen's proud cavil strain'd her tortur'd sense; Which bade her song to public praise aspire, And call'd attention to her trembling lyre. Ah! could she now, thus petrified with grief, Find in some lighter lay a vain relief, Still must she deem such verse, if such could be, A wound to friendship, and a crime to thee; Profanely utter'd at this sacred time, When thy pale corse demands her plaintive rhime, And Virtue, weeping whom she could not save, Calls the just mourner to thy recent grave. Hail, hallow'd vault! whose darksome caverns hold A frame, though mortal, of no common mould; A heart scarce sullied with a human flaw, Which shun'd no duty, and transgress'd no law; In joy still guarded, in distress serene, Thro' life a model of the golden mean, Which Friendship only led him to transgress, Whose heavenly spirit sanctifies excess. Pure mind! whose meekness, in thy mortal days, Pursuing virtue, still retir'd from praise; Nor wish'd that Friendship should on marble give That perfect image of thy worth to live, Which 'twas thy aim alone to leave imprest On the close tablet of her faithful breast. If now her verse against thy wish rebel, And strive to blazon, what she lov'd so well, Forgive the tender thought, the moral song, Which would thy virtues to the world prolong; That, rescued from the grave's oblivious shade, Their useful lustre may be still survey'd, Dear to the pensive eye of fond regret, As light still beaming from a sun that's set. Oft to our giddy Muse thy voice has taught The just ambition of poetic thought; Bid her bold view to latest time extend, And strive to make futurity her friend. If any verse, her little art can frame, May win the partial voice of distant fame, Be it the verse, whose fond ambition tries To paint thy mind in truth's unfading dyes, Tho' firm, yet tender, ardent, yet refin'd; With Roman strength and Attic grace combin'd. What tho' undeck'd with titles, power, and wealth, Great were thy generous deeds, and done by stealth; For thy pure bounty from observance stole, Nor wish'd applause, but from thy conscious soul. Tho' thy plain tomb no sculptur'd form may shew, No boastful witness of suspected woe; Yet heavenly shapes, that shun the glare of day, To that dear spot shall nightly visits pay: Pale Science there shall o'er her votary strew Her flow'rs, yet moist with sorrow's recent dew: There Charity, Compassion's lovely child, In rustic notes pathetically wild, With grateful blessings bid thy name endure, And mourn the patron of her village-poor. E'en from the midnight shew with music gay, The soul of Beauty to thy tomb shall stray, In sweet distraction steal from present mirth, To sigh unnotic'd o'er the hallow'd earth, Which hides those lips, that glow'd with tender fire, And sung her praises to no common lyre: But Friendship, wrapt in sorrow's deepest gloom, Shall keep the longest vigils at thy tomb; Her wounded breast, disdainful of relief, There claims a fond præeminence in grief: She, as the seasons of the year return, Shall place thy fav'rite plants around thy urn, Which, in the luxury of tender thought, Her care shall raise, with plaintive emblems wrought, Recalling ever, with remembrance sweet, Thy kind attachment to her calm retreat. Short was thy life, but ah! its thread how fine! How pure the texture of the finish'd line! What tho' thy opening manhood could not gain Those late rewards, maturer toils attain; Hope's firmest promises 'twas thine to raise, That merit's brightest meed would grace thy lengthen'd days; For thine were Judgment's patient powers, to draw Entangled justice from the nets of law; Thine firm Integrity, whose language clear Ne'er swell'd with arrogance, or shook with fear. Reason's mild power, unvex'd by mental strife, Sway'd the calm current of thy useful life; Whose even course was in no season lost, Nor rough with storms, nor stagnated by frost. In scenes of public toil, or social ease, 'Twas thine by firm sincerity to please; Sweet as the breath of spring thy converse flow'd, As summer's noon-tide warmth thy friendship glow'd. O'er thy mild manners, by no art constrain'd, A pensive, pleasing melancholy reign'd, Which won regard, and charm'd th' attentive eye, Like the soft lustre of an evening sky: Yet if perchance excited to defend The injur'd merit of an absent friend, That gentle spirit, rous'd to virtuous ire, Indignant flash'd resentment's noble fire. Tho' just observance in thy life may trace A lovely model of each moral grace, Thy last of days the noblest lesson taught: Severe instruction! and too dearly bought! Whose force from memory never can depart, But while it mends, must agonize the heart. Tho' thy shrunk nerves were destin'd to sustain Th' increasing horrors of slow-wasting pain; Those spirit-quenching pangs, whose base controul Clouds the clear temper, and exhausts the soul; Yet in that hour, when Death asserts his claim, And his strong summons shakes the conscious frame; When weaker minds; by frantic fear o'erthrown, Shrink in wild horror from the dread Unknown, Thy firmer soul, with Christian strength renew'd, Nor lost in languor, nor by pain subdued, (While thy cold grasp the hand of Friendship prest, And her vain aid in fault'ring accents blest) With awe, but not as Superstition's slave, Survey'd the gathering shadows of the grave; And to thy God, in death, devoutly paid That calm obedience which thy life display'd. Thou friend! yet left me of the choicer few, Whom grief's fond eyes with growing love review; O thou! whom mutal sorrow will incline To mix thy sympathetic sighs with mine; Still be it ours to pay, with just regret, At Friendship's facred shrine our common debt! Tho' doom'd (so Heaven ordains) to see no more The gentle Being, whom we both deplore; Painting shall still, sweet soothing art! supply A form so precious in Affection's eye. Ah! little thought we, in that happier hour, When our gay Muse rehears'd the Pencil's power; To mourn that form in cold obstruction laid, And see him only by the pencil's aid! Blest be that pencil, every art be blest, That stamps his image deeper on our breast! Oft let us loiter on his favourite hill, Whose shades the sadly-pleasing thought instil; Recount his kindness, as we fondly rove, And meet his spirit in the lonely grove. At evening's pensive hour, or opening day, He yet shall seem the partner of our way. Blest Spirit! still thro' Fancy's ear impart The calm of virtue to the troubled heart! Correct each sordid view, each vain desire, And touch the mortal, with celestial fire! So may we still, in this dark scene of earth, Hold sweet communion with thy living worth; And, while our purer thoughts thy merit scan, Revere the Angel, as we lov'd the Man. ODE, INSCRIBED TO JOHN HOWARD, Esq. F.R.S. AUTHOR OF “The State of English and Foreign Prisons.” ??????? ??????? ?????. Euripides. Fav'rite of Heaven, and friend of Earth! Philanthropy, benignant Power! Whose sons display no doubtful worth, The pageant of the passing hour! Teach me to paint, in deathless song, Some darling from thy filial throng, Whose deeds no party-rage inspire, But fill th' agreeing world with one desire, To echo his renown, responsive to my lyre! Ah! whither lead'st thou?—whence that sigh? What sound of woe my bosom jars? Why pass, where Misery's hollow eye Glares wildly thro' those gloomy bars? Is Virtue sunk in these abodes, Where keen Remorse the heart corrodes: Where Guilt's base blood with frenzy boils, And Blasphemy the mournful scene embroils?— From this infernal gloom my shudd'ring soul recoils. But whence those sudden sacred beams? Oppression drops his iron rod! And all the bright'ning dungeon seems To speak the presence of a God. Philanthropy's descending ray Diffuses unexpected day! Loveliest of angels!—at her side Her favourite votary stands;—her English pride, Thro' Horror's mansions led by this celestial guide. Hail! generous Howard! tho' thou bear A name which Glory's hand sublime Has blazon'd oft, with guardian care, In characters that fear not Time; For thee she fondly spreads her wings; For thee from Paradise she brings, More verdant than her laurel bough, Such wreaths of sacred Palm, as ne'er till now The smiling Seraph twin'd around a mortal brow. That Hero's Charles Howard, Earl of Nottingham. praise shall ever bloom, Who shielded our insulted coast; And launch'd his lightning to consume The proud Invader's routed host. Brave perils rais'd his noble name: But thou deriv'st thy matchless fame From scenes, where deadlier danger dwells; Where fierce Contagion, with affright, repels Valor's adventr'ous step from her malignant cells. Where in the dungeon's loathsome shade, The speechless Captive clanks his chain, With heartless hope to raise that aid His feeble cries have call'd in vain: Thine eye his dumb complaint explores; Thy voice his parting breath restores; Thy cares his ghastly visage clear From Death's chill dew, with many a clotted tear, And to his thankful soul returning life endear. What precious Drug, or stronger Charm, Thy constant fortitude inspires In scenes, whence, muttering her alarm, Med'cine Mussabat tacito Medecina timore. Lucretius., with selfish dread, retires? Nor Charm, nor Drug, dispel thy fears: Temperance, thy better guard, appears: For thee I see her fondly fill Her crystal cup from Nature's purest rill; Chief nourisher of life! best antidote of ill. I see the hallow'd shade of Hales Stephen Hales, minister of Teddington: he died at the age of 84, 1761; and has been justly called “An “ ornament to his profession, as a clergyman, and to his country, as “a philosopher.” I had the happiness of knowing this excellent man, when I was very young; and well remember the warm glow of benevolence which used to animate his countenance, in relating the success of his various projects for the benefit of mankind. I have frequently heard him dwell with great pleasure on the fortunate incident which led him to the discovery of his Ventilator, to which I have alluded.—He had ordered a new floor for one of his rooms; his carpenter not having prepared the work so soon as he expected, he thought the season improper for laying down new boards, when they were brought to his house, and gave orders for their being deposited in his barn;—from their accidental position in that place, he caught his first idea of this useful invention., Who felt, like thee, for human woe, And taught the health-diffusing gales Thro' Horror's murky cells to blow, As thy protecting angel wait; To save thee from the snares of Fate, Commission'd from the Eternal Throne: I hear him praise, in wonder's warmest tone, The virtues of thy heart, more active than his own. Thy foul supplies new funds of health, That fail not, in the trying hour, Above Arabia's spicy wealth And Pharmacy's reviving power. The transports of the generous mind, Feeling its bounty to mankind, Inspirit every mortal part; And, far more potent than precarious art, Give radiance to the eye, and vigor to the heart. Blest Howard! who like thee can feel This vital spring in all its force? New star of philanthropic zeal; Enlight'ning nations in thy course! And shedding Comfort's heavenly dew On meagre Want's deserted crew! Friend to the wretch, whom friends disclaim, Who feels stern Justice, in his famish'd frame, A persecuting fiend beneath an angel's name. Authority! unfeeling power, Whose iron heart can coldly doom The Debtor, dragg'd from Pleasure's bower, To sicken in the dungeon's gloom! O might thy terror-striking call Profusion's sons alone enthrall! But thou canst Want with Guilt confound; Thy bonds the Man of virtuous toil surround, Driven by malicious Fate within thy dreary bound. How savage are thy stern decrees! Thy cruel minister I see A weak, laborious victim seize, By worth entitled to be free! Behold, in the afflicting strife, The faithful partner of his life, In vain thy ruthless servant court, To spare her little children's sole support, Whom this terrific form has frighten'd from their sport. Nor weeps she only from the thought, Those infants must no longer share His aid, whose daily labour bought The pittance of their scanty fare. The horrors of the loathsome jail Her inly-bleeding heart assail: E'en now her fears, from fondness bred, See the lost partner of her faithful bed Drop, in that murd'rous scene, his pale, expiring head. Take comfort yet in these keen pains, Fond mourner! check thy gushing tears! The dungeon now no more contains Those perils which thy fancy fears: No more Contagion's baleful breath Speaks it the hideous cave of Death: Howard has planted safety there; Pure minister of light! his heavenly care Has purg'd the damp of Death from that polluted air. Nature! on thy maternal breast For ever be his worth engrav'd! Thy bosom only can attest How many a life his toil has sav'd: Nor in thy rescued Sons alone, Great Parent! this thy guardian own! His arm defends a dearer slave; Woman, thy darling! 'tis his pride to save Mr. Howard has been the happy instrument of preserving female prisoners from an infamous and indecent outrage.—It was formerly a custom in our gaols to load their legs and thighs with irons, for the detestable purpose of extorting money from these injured sufferers.—This circumstance, unknown to me when the Ode was written, has tempted me to introduce the few additional stanzas, as it is my ardent wish to render this tribute to an exalted character as little unworthy as I can of the very extensive and sublime merit which it aspires to celebrate. From evils, that surpass the horrors of the grave. Ye sprightly nymphs, by Fortune nurst, Who sport in Joy's unclouded air, Nor see the distant storms, that burst In ruin on the humble Fair; Ye know not to what bitter smart A kindred form, a kindred heart, Is often doom'd, in life's low vale, Where frantic fears the simple mind assail, And fierce afflictions press, and friends and fortune fail. See yon' sweet rustic, drown'd in tears! It is not Guilt—'tis Misery's flood, While dire Suspicion's charge she hears Of shedding infant, filial blood: Nature's fond dupe! but not her foe! That form, that face, the falshood show:— Yet Law exacts her stern demand; She bids the dungeon's grating doors expand, And the young captive faints beneath the gaoler's hand. Ah, ruffian! cease thy savage aim! She cannot 'scape thy harsh controul: Shall iron load that tender frame, And enter that too-yielding soul?— Unfeeling wretch! of basest mind! To misery deaf, to beauty blind! I see thy victim vainly plead; For the worst fiend of hell's malignant breed, Extortion, grins applause, and prompts thy ruthless deed. With brutal force, and ribald jest, Thy manacles I see thee shake; Mocking the merciful request, That Modesty and Justice make; E'en Nature's shriek, with anguish strong, Fails to suspend the impious wrong; Till Howard's hand, with brave disdain, Throws far away this execrable chain: O Nature, spread his fame thro' all thy ample reign! His care exulting Britain found, Here first display'd, not here confin'd! No single tract of earth could bound The active virtues of his mind. To all the lands, where'er the tear, That mourn'd the Prisoner's wrongs severe, Sad Pity's glist'ning cheek impearl'd, Eager he steer'd, with every sail unfurl'd, A friend to every clime! a Patriot of the World! Ye nations thro' whose fair domain Our flying sons of joy have past, By Pleasure driven with loosen'd rein, Astonish'd that they flew so fast! How did the heart-improving sight Awake your wonder and delight, When, in her unexampled chace, Philanthropy outstript keen Pleasure's pace, When with a warmer soul she ran a nobler race! Where e'er her generous Briton went, Princes his supplicants became: He seem'd the enquiring angel, sent To scrutinize their secret shame I am credibly informed that several Princes, or at least persons in authority, requested Mr. Howard not to publish a minute account of some prisons, which reflected disgrace on their government. Captivity, where he appear'd, Her languid head with transport rear'd; And gazing on her godlike guest, Like those of old, whom Heaven's pure servant blest, E'en by his shadow seem'd of demons dispossest. Amaz'd her foreign children cry, Seeing their patron pass along: “O! who is he, whose daring eye Can search into our hidden wrong? What monarch's Heaven-directed mind, With royal bounty unconfin'd, Has tempted Freedom's son to share These perils; searching with an angel's care Each cell of dire Disease, each cavern of Despair?” No monarch's word, nor lucre's lust, Nor vain ambition's restless fire, Nor ample power, that sacred trust! His life-diffusing toils inspire: Rous'd by no voice, save that whose cries Internal bid the soul arise From joys, that only seem to bless, From low pursuits, which little minds possess, To Nature's noblest aim, the Succour of Distress! Taught by that God, in Mercy's robe, Who his celestial throne resign'd, To free the prison of the globe From vice, th' oppressor of the mind! For thee, of misery's rights bereft, For thee, Captivity! he left Inviting Ease, who, in her bower, Bade him with smiles enjoy the golden hour, While Fortune deck'd his board with Pleasure's festive flower. While to thy virtue's utmost scope I boldly strive my aim to raise, As high as mortal hand may hope To shoot the glittering ?????? ?? ??? ?????? ??????? ????????, ??????? ?? ??????????? ?????? ???? ?? ???- ??? ?????? ??? ?????? ??????. PINDAR. shaft of Praise; Say! Howard, say! what may the Muse, Whose melting eye thy merit views, What guerdon may her love design? What may she ask for thee, from Power Divine, Above the rich rewards which are already thine? Sweet is the joy when Science flings Her light on philosophic thought; When Genius, with keen ardour, springs To clasp the lovely truth he sought: Sweet is the joy, when Rapture's fire Flows from the spirit of the lyre; When Liberty and Virtue roll Spring-tides of fancy o'er the poet's soul, That waft his flying bark thro' seas above the pole. Sweet the delight, when the gall'd heart Feels Consolation's lenient hand Bind up the wound from Fortune's dart With Friendship's life-supporting band! And sweeter still, and far above These fainter joys, when purest Love The soul his willing captive keeps! When he in bliss the melting spirit steeps, Who drops delicious tears, and wonders that he weeps! But not the brightest joy, which Arts, In floods of mental light, bestow; Nor what firm Friendship's zeal imparts, Blest antidote of bitterest woe! Nor those that Love's sweet hours dispense, Can equal the ecstatic sense, When, swelling to a fond excess, The grateful praises of reliev'd distress, Re-echoed thro' the heart, the soul of Bounty bless. These transports, in no common state, Supremely pure, sublimely strong, Above the reach of envious fate, Blest Howard! these to thee belong: While years encreasing o'er thee roll, Long may this sunshine of the soul New vigour to thy frame convey! Its radiance thro' thy noon of life display, And with serenest light adorn thy closing day! And when the Power, who joys to save, Proclaims the guilt of earth forgiven; And calls the prisoners of the grave To all the liberty of Heaven: In that bright day, whose wonders blind The eye of the astonish'd mind; When life's glad angel shall resume His ancient sway, announce to Death his doom, And from existence drive that tyrant of the tomb: In that blest hour, when Seraphs sing The triumphs gain'd in human strife; And to their new associates bring The wreaths of everlasting life: May'st thou, in Glory's hallow'd blaze, Approach th' Eternal Fount of Praise, With those who lead th' angelic van, Those pure adherents to their Saviour's plan, Who liv'd but to relieve the miseries of man! ODE TO Mr. WRIGHT of DERBY. 1783. Away! ye sweet, but trivial Forms, That from the placid pencil rise, When playful art the landscape warms With Italy's unclouded skies! Stay, Vanity! nor yet demand Thy portrait from the painter's hand! Nor ask thou, Indolence, to aid thy dream, The soft illusion of the mimic stream, That twinkles to thy sight with Cynthia's trembling beam! Be thine, my friend, a nobler task! Beside thy vacant easel see Guests, who, with claims superior, ask New miracles of art from thee: Valour, who mocks unequal strife, And Clemency, whose smile is life! “Wright! let thy skill (this radiant pair exclaim) “Give to our view our favorite scene of Fame, “Where Britain's Genius blaz'd in glory's brightest “flame.” Celestial ministers! ye speak To no dull agent sloth opprest, Who coldly hears, in spirit weak, Heroic Virtue's high behest: Behold! tho' envy strives to foil The Artist bent on public toil, Behold! his flames terrific lustre shed; His naval blaze mounts from its billowy bed; And Calpe proudly rears her war-illumin'd head. In gorgeous pomp for ever shine, Bright monument of Britain's force! Tho' doom'd to feel her fame decline In ill-starr'd war's o'erwhelming course, Tho' Europe's envious realms unite To crush her, in unequal fight, Her Genius, deeply stung with generous shame, On this exulting rock array'd in flame Equals her ancient feats, and vindicates her name. How fiercely British valour pours The deluge of destroying fire, Which o'er that watery Babel roars, Bidding the baffled host retire, And leave their fall'n, to yield their breath In different pangs of double death! Ye shall not perish: no! ye hapless brave, Reckless of peril, thro' the fiery wave See! British mercy steers, each prostrate foe to save. Ye gallant Chiefs, whose deeds proclaim The genuine hero's feeling soul, Elliot, and Curtis, with whose name Honour enrich'd his radiant roll, Blest is your fate; nor blest alone, That rescued foes your virtues own, That Britain triumphs in your filial worth: Blest in the period of your glory's birth, When art can bid it live to decorate the earth! Alas! what deeds, where virtue reign'd, Have in oblivious darkness died, When Painting, by the Goths enchain'd, No life-securing tints supplied!— Of all thy powers, enchanting art! Thou deemest this the dearest part, To guard the rights of valour, and afford Surviving lustre to the hero's sword: For this, heroic Greece thy martial charms ador'd. Rival of Greece, in arms, in arts, Tho' deem'd in her declining days, Britain yet boasts unnumber'd hearts, Who keenly pant for public praise: Her battles yet are firmly fought By Chiefs with Spartan courage fraught: Her Painters with Athenian zeal unite To trace the glories of the prosp'rous fight, And gild th' embattled scene with art's immortal light. Tho' many a hand may well portray The rushing war's infuriate shock, Proud Calpe bids thee, Wright! display The terrors of her blazing rock; The burning bulks of baffled Spain, From thee she claims, nor claims in vain, Thou mighty master of the mimic flame, Whose matchless pencil, with peculiar aim, Has form'd of lasting fire the basis of thy fame. Just in thy praise, thy country's voice Loudly asserts thy signal power: In this reward may'st thou rejoice, In modest labour's silent hour, Far from those seats, where envious leagues, And dark cabals, and base intrigues Exclude meek Merit from his proper home; Where Art, whom Royalty forbade to roam, Against thy talents clos'd her self-dishonor'd dome! When partial pride, and mean neglect, The nerves of injur'd Genius gall, What kindly spells of keen effect His energy of heart recall? Perchance there is no spell so strong As Friendship's sympathetic song: By fancy link'd in a fraternal band, Artist and Bard in sweet alliance stand; They suffer equal wounds, and mutual aid demand. Go, then, to slighted worth devote Thy willing verse, my fearless Muse! Haply thy free and friendly note Some joyous ardor may infuse In fibres, that severely smart From potent Envy's poison'd dart: Thro' Wright's warm breast bid tides of vigor roll, Guard him from meek Depression's chill controul, And rouse him to exert each sinew of his soul! ODE TO THE COUNTESS DE GENLIS. 1784. I No more let English pride arraign The Gallic Muse, as light and vain, Whose trifling fingers can but weave The flimsy novel, to deceive Inaction's languid hour; Where sentiment, from nothing spun, Shines like a garden-cobweb in the sun, Thrown in autumnal nights o'er many a wither'd flower. II Too often, in the giddy fit Of wanton or satiric wit, The rash and frolic sons of France Have sketch'd the frivolous romance; While reason stood aloof; While modesty the work disclaim'd; And griev'd religion, with disdain inflam'd, On the licentious page pronounc'd her just reproof. III The Genius of the generous land Survey'd the vain fantastic band, And kindling with indignant pride, Athirst for genuine glory, cried: “Too long have ye disgrac'd “The Gallic name!—ye sophists, hence! “A female hand shall expiate your offence, “The wrongs that ye have done to virtue, truth, and “taste. IV “Rise, my Genlis! those ills correct, “That spring from this pernicious sect: “To infancy's important years, “That season of parental fears, “Devote thy varied page! “Mould and defend the youthful heart “Against the subtle, soul-debasing art “Of the sarcastic wit, and self-intitled sage!” V Illumin'd with angelic zeal, And wishing Nature's general weal, The lovely moralist arose: The flame that from religion flows Play'd round her pensive head: The tender virtues smiling strove T' enrich the variegated web she wove, Where wisdom's temperate hand the flowers of fancy spread. VI The sisters of theatric power, Whose intermingled sun and shower Give to the stage, in friendly strife, Each touching charm of chequer'd life, Inspir'd the friend of youth: Arts yet unknown to her they taught, To fix and charm quick childhood's rambling thought With unexampled scenes of tenderness and truth. VII Her pathos is not proudly built On splendid or impassion'd guilt; The little incidents, that rise As sportive youth's light season flies, Her simple drama fill; Yet he, the sweet Socratic sage Euripides., Who steep'd in tears the wide Athenian stage, Fram'd not his moral scene with more pathetic skill. VIII In the rich novel's ampler field Her genius rears a radiant shield, With fancy's blazonry imprest; Potent to save the youthful breast From passion's poison'd dart: Like that which Homer's gods produce, Its high-wrought beauties shine with double use, To charm the curious mind, and guard th' unwary heart. IX Ye Fairies! 'twas your boast to bind In sweet amaze the infant mind: But scorning fiction's faded flower, Behold Genlis in magic power Your sorcery excells! She, first of childhood's pleasing friends! Arm'd with the force that liberal science lends, From art and nature frames her more attractive spells Alluding to the Tale intitled, “La Féerie de l' Art &amp; de la Nature.”. X Lovely magician! in return For the sweet tears of fond concern, With moral pleasure's tender thrill Awak'd by thy enchanting skill, Accept this votive rhyme! Spurn not a wreath of foreign hue, Tho' rudely twin'd of humble flowers, that grew In a sequester'd vale of Albion's wayward clime! XI Think, if from Britain's churlish sky This verse to foreign genius fly, Think not our letter'd females raise No titles to melodious praise:— Keen science cannot find One clime within the earth's wide zone, Whose daughters, Britain! have surpass'd thy own In the career of art, the triumphs of the mind. XII This honest boast of English pride, Which meaner merit might deride, Will ne'er the just Genlis beguile Of one disdainful, envious smile; For envy ne'er conceal'd From her clear sight a rival's claim; Her voice has swell'd my fair compatriots fame, Pleas'd with their glorious march o'er learning's varied field! XIII Doubly, Genlis! may'st thou rejoice, Whene'er impartial glory's voice Ranks with the happiest toils of men The graceful works of woman's pen, Tho' not of Gallic frame: For O! beneath whatever skies Records of female genius may arise, Those records must enfold thy fair and fav'rite name. XIV In every clime where arts have smil'd, Where'er the mother loves her child, And pants, with anxious zeal possest, To fortify the tender breast, And the young mind enlarge, From thy chaste page she'll learn the art, Fondly to play the sage preceptor's part, And draw her dearest joys from that important charge: XV Wherever youth, with curious view, Instructive pleasure shall pursue, The little lively student there, With rapt attention's keenest air, Shall o'er thy volumes bend: And while his tears their charm confess, His grateful voice shall in their author bless The spirit-kindling guide, the heart-enchanting friend. SONNETS, SONGS, AND OCCASIONAL VERSES. SONNET TO THE EARL OF HARDWICKE With the Second Edition of the Epistles to Romney. 1779. Hardwicke! whose bright applause a poet crown'd Unknown to thee and to the Muse's quire; Permit his hand with joyous pride to sound A note of gratitude on freedom's lyre! And fear not flattery's song from one plac'd higher Than she has power to raise her menial crew; From one who, proud of independent fire, Scorns the base Noble, but reveres the true. The liberal spirit feels thy generous praise Fall from pure honour's sphere, like genial dew; Blest if its vital influence shall raise A future flower more worthy of thy view! Blest if in these re-polish'd lays thou find Some light reflected from thy letter'd mind! SONNET TO EDWARD GIBBON, Esq. On the Publication of his Second and Third Volumes. 1781. With proud delight th' imperial founder gaz'd On the new beauty of his second Rome, When on his eager eye rich temples blaz'd, And his fair city rose in youthful bloom: A pride more noble may thy heart assume, O Gibbon! gazing on thy growing work; In which, constructed for a happier doom, No hasty marks of vain ambition lurk: Thou may'st deride both time's destructive sway, And baser envy's beauty-mangling dirk; Thy gorgeous fabrick, plann'd with wise delay, Shall baffle foes more savage than the Turk: As ages multiply its fame shall rise, And earth must perish ere its splendor dies. SONNET TO THE SAME. Written in Madame de Lambert's Essays on Friendship and Old Age; in the Name of the Lady who translated them. How may I, Gibbon, to thy taste confide This artless copy of a Gallic gem? Wilt thou not cast th' unpolish'd work aside, And with just scorn my failing line condemn? No! thou wilt never, with pedantic phlegm, Spurn the first produce of a female mind; Young flowers! that, trembling on a tender stem, Court thy protection from each ruder wind. Tho' I may injure, by a coarser style, The work that Lambert's graceful hand design'd, I still, if favour'd by thy partial smile, Shall boast like her of friendship's joys refin'd; Nor fear from age her list of female woes, If, as my years increase, thy friendship grows. SONNET TO EDMUND ANTROBUS, Esq. With the same Essays. Kind Host! who bordering on the vale of years, Keep'st in thy generous heart a youthful glow, Whose liberal elegance of soul endears The joy thy bounty glories to bestow; Accept a volume, in whose pages flow The mild effusions of a female mind! First of the letter'd fair that France can show, Of sprightly wit with moral truth combin'd! In the faint copy may thy candour see Some slight resemblance of her style refin'd: Whate'er the merits of the book, in thee May all the blessings of its theme be join'd! Thine be that joy which friendship's bosom fills; And thine the peace of age, without its ills! SONNET TO Dr. HARINGTON On his adding Music to a Song of the Author's. Harmonious friend! to whom my honour'd Muse Is eager to declare how much she owes, Accept, and with indulgent eye peruse Her hasty verse, impatient to disclose How from your aid her new attraction flows. Cold as the figure of unfinish'd clay, Which by Prometheus' plastic hand arose, My lifeless song in half existence lay: I could not add the spark of heav'nly flame: To harmony's high sphere I dar'd not stray To steal from thence—but in this languid frame You pour, without a theft, the vital ray: Your generous art the quick'ning spirit gives, And by your tuneful fire the Ballad lives. SONNET TO WILLIAM MELMOTH, Esq. Melmoth! in talents and in virtues blest! Pleas'd I contemplate thy attractive page, Where thy mild Pliny, and Rome's guardian Sage, Of purer eloquence, thy powers attest, And rare felicity:—near half an age Our polish'd tongue has rank'd thee with the best Of England's classics; yet detraction's rage Has fail'd to point her arrows at thy breast: Rich in those palms that taste and truth bestow, Who praise in learning's field thy long career, By what nice skill, that worth can seldom show, Hast thou eluded slander's envious sneer? Blest who excel! but tenfold bliss they know, Who in excelling live without a foe. SONNET TO Mrs. HAYLEY On her Voyage to America. 1784. Thou vext Atlantic, who hast lately seen Britain's vain thunder on her offspring hurl'd, And the blind parent, in her frantic spleen, Pouring weak vengeance on a filial world! Thou, whose rough billows, in loud fury curl'd, Have roar'd indignant under many a keel; And, while contention all her sails unfurl'd, Have groan'd the weight of ill-starr'd war to feel; Now let thy placid waters gaily bear A freight far differing from blood-thirsty steel; See Hayley now to cross thy flood prepare, A female merchant, fraught with friendly zeal! Give her kind gales, ye spirits of the air, Kind as her heart, and as her purpose fair! SONNET TO JOHN SARGENT, Esq. On his Doubts of publishing his Drama, intitled, ‘The Mine.’ 1784. Away with diffidence and modest fear, Thou happy fav'rite of Castalia's quire! Withhold no longer from the public ear The rich delight thy varied lays inspire! Nor from the Press with trembling awe retire! That dread essay is dangerous alone, When mimic dross adulterates the lyre: Thine is of purest gold—its perfect tone The fancy and the heart alike obey: Invention's self has made her Mine thy own; Give its new gems to blaze in open day, And seat that bounteous queen on glory's throne, A brother Bard, if he may boast the name, Sounds with proud joy this prelude to thy fame. SONNET ON ROMNEY's Picture of Cassandra. Ye fond idolaters of antient art, Who near Parthenope, with curious toil, Forcing the rude sulphureous rocks to part, Draw from the greedy earth her buried spoil Of antique tablature; and from the soil Of time, restoring some fair form, acquire A fancied jewel, know, 'tis but a foil To this superior gem, of richer fire! In Romney's tints behold the Trojan maid! See beauty blazing in prophetic ire! From palaces engulph'd could earth retire, And shew thy works, Apelles, undecay'd, E'en thy Campaspe would not dare to vie With the wild splendor of Cassandra's eye. SONNET TO Mrs. SMITH Occasioned by the First of her Sonnets. Thou whose chaste song simplicity inspires, Attractive poetess of plaintive strain! Speak not unjustly of poetic fires, Nor the pure bounty of thy Muse arraign: No, not the source, the soother she of pain. If thy soft breast the thorns of anguish knew, Ah! think what myriads with thy truth complain Of fortune's thorny paths! and think how few Of all those myriads know thy magic art, The fiercer pangs of sorrow to subdue, By those melodious tears that ease thy heart, And bid the breath of fame thy life renew; Sure to excite, till nature's self decays, Her lasting sympathy, her endless praise! SONNET TO Mr. WILLIAM LONG On his Recovery from a dangerous Illness. 1785. Blest be the day which bids my grief subside, Rais'd by the sickness of my distant friend! Blest the dear lines, so long to hope deny'd, By languor's aching fingers kindly penn'd! How keen the fear to feel his letters end, Whose wit was my delight, whose truth my guide! But how did joy that painful fear transcend, When I again his well-known hand descried! Such was the dread of new-created man, When first he miss'd the setting orb of day; Such the delight that thro' his bosom ran, When he perceiv'd the re-ascending ray. Ah no! his thoughts endur'd less anxious strife; Thou, Friendship! art the sun of mental life. EPITAPH ON WILLIAM BRYANT, Aged 91, Parish Clerk of Eartham. 1779, By sportive youth and busy manhood blest, Here, thou meek father of our village, rest! If length of days, in toilsome duties spent, With chearful honesty, and mild content; If age, endur'd with firm and patient mind; If life with willing piety resign'd; If these are certain proofs of human worth, Which, dear to Heaven, demand the praise of earth; E'en Pride shall venerate this humble sod, That holds a Christian worthy of his God, ON FRANCES KENT, Aged 19; buried in Eartham Church-Yard. 1777. Here youthful innocence, of humble birth, Is sunk untimely into silent earth: This quiet hamlet knew no gentler mind, “In sickness patient, and in death resign'd.” Thou peaceful villager, whoe'er thou art, Now bending o'er her grave with feeling heart, Learn from her blameless life, tho' short the date, Each modest virtue that becomes thy state! ON MARY HAYLEY. 1775. Spirit of Truth, thy warmest language give! Let all the Mother on this marble live! The stone may boast, that in her frame combin'd Woman's soft heart and man's undaunted mind: But O, fond Parent! no sepulchral lay Can speak thy kindness, or thy care repay: Death bore thee to the Power, whose love alone, Whose love parental could exceed thy own. Still, thou blest being! still my soul inspire! Breathe from thy tomb religion's holy fire! And teach me, ere this fleeting breath shall cease, To tread that aweful path in mental peace, That path, which thou without a pang hast trod, To meet thee at the throne of mercy's God: The God, whose worship from thy lips I caught, Shall fix thy image in my faithful thought: So thou my spirit to his presence raise, Who as thy Maker most commands my praise! ODE TO DEATH. Hail to thee, gloomy spectre, Death! So seldom hail'd by human breath With vital vigour warm! Approach!—let me thy features know, For my undaunted eye would grow Familiar with thy form! I see thee well, and all thy train, The horrid armament of pain, Who execute thy will: I know their force: with rapid aim, Early they fasten'd on my frame, And only fail'd to kill. O Death! I know thy utmost sway; This flesh is thy devoted prey: My soul derides thy power; Derides each wound, which thou canst give, Safe from thy stroke, and form'd to live Beyond thy final hour. I own thee not as Terror's king, Tho' shrieking slaves thy title ring, Around the trembling globe: The hand of Faith thy mantle tore, And Fear can dress thy form no more In Horror's ghastly robe. I see thee, stript of all thy pride, A simple herald, doom'd to guide The Spirit's destin'd march: Thy trumpet, with no dreadful blast, Proclaims the victor soul has past The tomb's triumphal arch.— Ah! why should age, with weak delay, In vain contention wish to stay, When robb'd of vigour's shield? What labourer, call'd to take his hire, Persists his worn-out limbs to tire Around the stubble field? This motley scene of jest and strife, This tragi-comedy of life, On observation palls: Its fancied joys too slightly touch; Its fancied woes afflict too much, Before the curtain falls. Eager I pant, with fond presage, To gaze on a sublimer stage Above yon starry pole: That stage, by kindred angels trod, Illumin'd by the throne of God, Must fill the raptur'd soul. O Death! I hear thy stern reply:— “Dar'st thou presume, Mortality! “So abject, so infirm! “Fearless that Presence to abide, “Before whose blaze celestial pride “Has shrunk into a worm?” Of follies sick, not sunk by crimes, With filial hope my spirit climbs, Nor fears a Father's rod. I go with awe, but not dismay: My soul is on the wing:—away! And lead me to my God! SONG. [Ye cliffs! I to your airy steep] I Ye cliffs! I to your airy steep Ascend with trembling hope and fear, To gaze on this extensive deep, And watch if William's sails appear. II Long months elapse, while here I breathe Vain expectation's frequent prayer; Till bending o'er the waves beneath, I drop the tear of dumb despair. III But see a glistening sail in view! Tumultuous hopes arise: 'Tis he!—I feel the vision true, I trust my conscious eyes. IV His promis'd signals from the mast My timid doubts destroy: What was your pain, ye terrors past, To this ecstatic joy! SONG. [From glaring shew, and giddy noise] I From glaring shew, and giddy noise, The pleasures of the vain, Take me, ye soft, ye silent joys, To your retreats again. II Be mine, ye cool, ye peaceful groves, Whose shades to love belong; Where echo, as she fondly roves, Repeats my Stella's song. III Ah, Stella! why-should I depart From solitude and thee, When in that solitude thou art A perfect world to me! SONG. ['Tis Memory's aid my vows implore] I 'Tis Memory's aid my vows implore, For she will smile when fortune's coy; And to the eye of love restore The spirit of departed joy. II O plunge me still, with magic art, In soothing fancy's soft abyss; And fill my fond, my faithful heart With visions of thy purer bliss! SONG. [Stay! O stay, thou lovely shade] I Stay! O stay, thou lovely shade Brought by sleep to sorrow's aid: Ah! the sweet illusion ends! Light and Reason, cruel friends! Bid me not, with frantic care, Vainly worship fleeting air! II Night, return on rapid wing! Round my head thy poppies fling! Hateful day! thy reign be brief! Darkness is the friend of grief. Could'st thou, sleep! my dream restore, I should wish to wake no more. SONG. [Enjoy, my child, the balmy sleep] I Enjoy, my child, the balmy sleep, Which o'er thy form new beauty throws; And long thy tranquil spirit keep A stranger to thy mother's woes! Tho' in distress, I feel it less, While gazing on thy sweet repose. II Condemn'd to pangs like inward fire, That thro' my injur'd bosom roll, How would my heart in death desire Relief from fortune's hard coutroul, Did not thy arms And infant charms To earth enchain my anxious soul! III Flow fast, my tears!—by you reliev'd, I vent my anguish thus unknown; But cease, ere ye can be perceiv'd By this dear child, to pity prone, Whose tender heart Would seize a part In grief, that should be all my own. IV Our cup of woe, which angels fill, Perchance it is my lot to drain; While that of joy, unmix'd with ill, May thus, my child, for thee remain; If thou art free, (So Heaven decree!) I bless my doom of double pain. ODE TO RICHARD VERNON SADLEIR, Esq. 1777. I Business, be gone! Thou vulture, Care, No more the quivering sinews tear Of Sadleir's mortal frame! Full well his firm and active mind Has paid the duties that mankind From sense and virtue claim. II Alas! too well—for mental toil Our fine machinery will spoil, As Nature has decreed: She form'd the powers that raise the foul Like wheels, that kindle as they roll, And perish by their speed. III Let health and vigour on the stage Support the scene, while milder age Resigns the bustling part: If flowers the busy path adorn, Ingratitude there plants her thorn, Which pierces to the heart. IV Oft hast thou seen her poison'd shoot, Where Hope expected fairest fruit; Yet still thy bounty flows Like constant dew that falls on earth, Although it wakens into birth The nightshade with the rose. V Thy warmth of heart O still retain! Nor of ingratitude complain, Howe'er her wounds may burn! Bliss from benevolence must flow; Angels are blest while they bestow, Unconscious of return. VI And happiness we only find In those exertions of the mind That form the ardent friend: In these it dwells, with these it flies, As all the comet's splendor dies Whene'er its motions end. VII O let the lustre of thy soul No more eccentrically roll Thro' Labour's long career! O haste, its dangerous course confine, And let it permanently shine In Pleasure's milder sphere! VIII In Friendship's name thy voice invites Our willing hearts to social rites, Where Laughter is thy guest: But, O! these eyes with anguish burn, And fear their weaken'd orbs to turn From Nature's verdant vest. IX Thy invitation then forbear, Tho' at thy board, in union rare, Kind Plenty reigns with Wit: Thy roof is joyous, but I doubt That we should find the brilliant rout For burning eyes unfit. X Thy noisy town and dusty street Do thou exchange for this retreat, Whose charms thy songs commend: On Learning's page forbid to look, We yet can read that dearer book— The visage of a friend. A CARD of INVITATION TO Mr. GIBBON, at Brighthelmstone. 1781. An English Sparrow, pert and free, Who chirps beneath his native tree, Hearing the Roman Eagle's near, And feeling more respect than fear, Thus, with united love and awe, Invites him to his shed of straw. Tho' he is but a twittering Sparrow, The field he hops in rather narrow, When nobler plumes attract his view He ever pays them homage due, And looks with reverential wonder On him whose talons bear the thunder; Nor could the Jack-daws e'er inveigle His voice to vilify the Eagle, Tho', issuing from those holy tow'rs In which they build their warmest bow'rs, Their Sovereign's haunt they slily search, In hopes to find him on his perch (For Pindar says, beside his God The thunder-bearing Bird will nod) Then, peeping round his still retreat, They pick from underneath his feet Some moulted feather he lets fall, And swear he cannot fly at all.— Lord of the sky! whose pounce can tear These croakers, that infest the air, Trust him, the Sparrow loves to sing The praise of thy imperial wing! He thinks thou'lt deem him, on his word, An honest, tho' familiar Bird; And hopes thou soon wilt condescend To look upon thy little friend; That he may boast around his grove A visit from the Bird of Jove. TO Mr. MASON, On his sending the Author his Translation of DuFresnoy, with Notes by Sir Joshua Reynolds. 1783. I Dear Brother of the tuneful art, To whom I justly bend, I prize, with a fraternal heart, The pleasing gift you send. II With pride, by envy undebas'd, My English spirit views How far your elegance of taste Improves a Gallic Muse. III I thought that Muse but meanly drest When her stiff gown was Latin; But you have turn'd her grogram vest Into fine folds of sattin. IV Mild Reynolds looks with liberal favour On your adopted girl; And to the graceful robe you gave her, Adds rich festoons of pearl. IMPROMPTU TO Mr. MEYER. On his sending the Author, from the Continent, two Prints, representing The Coronation of Voltaire, and Rousseau's Arrival in Elysium. 1784. I The Song that shakes the festive roof, When mirth and music's liveliest notes ascend, Is not more pleasing than the proof Of kind remembrance from an absent friend. II Then guess the pleasure that we share, And thus, dear Meyer, accept the thanks we owe, While we behold the crown'd Voltaire, And see Elysium hail our lov'd Rousseau! III May all the honour, all the joy, Known by each genius in thy gift portray'd, Be thine, without the dull alloy That ting'd their golden days with dusky shade! IV As lively as the gay Voltaire, With his keen pen may thy fine pencil strive! May'st thou as long delight the fair, And triumph, like the Bard, at eighty-five! V As tender as the warm Rousseau, Like him thy happier thoughts on nature fix! But 'midst thy prospering children know A true Elysium—on this side the Styx! IMPROMPTU, TO EYLES IRWIN, Esq. at Eartham. 1786. How fiercely gold is tried by fire, The tropes of the poetic quire Have forcibly exprest: Yet, Indus, oft thy golden tide To British virtue has supplied A still severer test. Britain has sent thee many a name (Of martial and of civic fame) In honour sound and whole; Return'd by thee in different mould, Encrusted o'er with scales of gold, A leper in the soul. Far other thoughts of proud delight, Dear Irwin, may the wish'd-for sight Of thy return afford! To welcome thee our hearts expand; Fondly we clasp the purest hand That Indus e'er restor'd. The tender lips of Beauty greet This happy hand with homage sweet, And bless the nuptial chain: While Friendship sings, in joyous ode, Thro' this the trying millions flow'd, Nor left a single stain. A RECEIPT TO MAKE A TRAGEDY. Take a Virgin from Asia, from Afric, or Greece, At least a king's daughter, or emperor's niece: Take an elderly Miss for her kind confidant, Still ready with pity or terror to pant, While she faints and revives like the sensitive plant: Take a Hero thought buried some ten years or more, But with life enough left him to rattle and roar: Take a horrid old Brute who deserves to be rack'd, And call him a tyrant ten times in each act: Take a Priest of cold blood, and a Warrior of hot, And let them alternately bluster and plot: Then throw in of Soldiers and Slaves quantum suff. Let them march, and stand still, fight, and halloo enough. Now stir all together these separate parts, And season them well with Ohs! faintings, and starts: Squeeze in, while they're stirring, a potent infusion Of Rage and of Horror, of Love and Illusion; With madness and murder complete the conclusion. Let your Princess, tho' dead by the murderous dagger, In a wanton bold epilogue ogle and swagger: Prove her past scenes of virtue are vapour and smoke, And the stage's morality merely a joke: Let her tell with what follies our country is curst, And wisely conclude that play-writing's the worst. Now serve to the public this olio complete, And puff in the papers your delicate treat. TO Miss SEWARD, On her being at Eartham, in the variable Weather, August, 1782. I “Whence are these storms?”—an angry poet cry'd, Who saw his shady summer haunts defac'd; Saw o'er his shatter'd grove black whirlwinds ride, And loud lamented this untimely waste. II He spoke, and Æolus uprear'd his head: Half his huge form, round which dark clouds were driv'n, Rising from ocean's broad and billowy bed, Fill'd up the vast expanse from earth to heav'n. III As his fierce eye survey'd the rough profound, From the stern god the voice of anger broke; Air, earth, and sea, reverberate the found, And shrinking nature shudder'd as he spoke: IV “Know, thou vain Bard, within thy mansion dwells “The wond'rous source of all this wild uproar; “Thence round my cave the din of discord swells, “And I my rebel offspring rule no more. V “To own my laws my mad'ning sons refuse, “All, all are deaf to my paternal pow'r; “Struggling alike to kiss that vagrant Muse, “Who deigns to visit thy sequester'd bow'r. VI “Rough Boreas, us'd in these still months to sleep, “Starts from his cell, in passion's wild alarms; “While dripping Auster rushes from the deep, “To snatch the Fair-one from his brother's arms. VII “Each other's fond ambition to destroy, “Alike they struggle, merciless as death; “See my young Zephyr, Nature's tender joy, “Encounters Eurus with contentious breath. VIII “Cease, my rash sons, this cruel war to wage, “Tho' tempting beauty gave your conflict birth, “Lest Famine, waken'd by your frantic rage, “Stalk in fell triumph o'er the blasted earth. IX “See shiv'ring mortals mourn th' inverted year, “While Ceres weeps her golden pride deprest: “If ye no longer Nature's law revere, “Yet mildly listen to your sire's request:— X “Let each in order taste the tempting bliss, “For which these mutual wounds ye vainly bear; “Each unmolested take one precious kiss, “And freely clasp this phrenzy-kindling Fair.” XI He paus'd;—black Boreas, eldest of his race, Whose stormy passion the chill Maiden shocks, Binds her reluctant in his strong embrace, And sports licentious in her auburn locks. XII Eurus succeeds, of less disgusting mien, Yet mad the trembling Fair-one to assail; Beneath his pressure, more intensely keen, The wounded ruby of her lip grows pale. XIII Next, with mild charms, and less tumultuous love, By melting Auster see the nymph carest; He, with the softness of the murm'ring dove, Waves his moist pinions o'er her softer breast. XIV Now, lively Zephyr, the sweet Muse is thine, O long embrace her in our laughing skies! And round her bid this joyous landscape shine, Rich as her verse, and radiant as her eyes! CONTENT. Written at the request of a Lady, for the Vase at Batheaston, 1781. “How idle are mortals!” (said Wisdom to Youth) “They slight the clear dictates of Reason and Truth; “They worship Ambition, to Pleasure they bend, “Yet blindly o'erlook a more excellent friend: “And hence their vain hopes are eternally crost, “Their life in a tempest of wishes is lost; “Still destin'd to toil, and of toil to repent, “For neglect of just vows to the Goddess Content; “That Goddess from whom all felicity flows, “Who unites every good in the gift she bestows; “So free of her bounty to all who confess it, “To solicit her smile is almost to possess it.” When I heard this fine speech, my fond passion was rais'd, And I set forth in quest of the Being so prais'd; At the mansion of Grandeur my search I begin, And ask if the Goddess Content is within: But Pride, who as centinel guarded the door, Said bluntly he ne'er heard her title before; He told me I wanted a poor rustic slut, And bade me go look in some little thatch'd hut. I march'd to the Villager's lowly abode, 'Twas a snug pretty cottage, and stood near the road: And here a good woman, possessing, tho' humble, A face that could frown, and a tongue that would grumble, Said—the person I ask'd for had lodg'd in her cot, But, alas! such good luck was no longer her lot; For she quitted her roof, where she oft had repos'd, When yon great house was built, and the common inclos'd. I conceiv'd, as I now bade the village farewell, With the mild sons of Science this Goddess must dwell; But those, where I sought some obliging instructor, Were squabbling about an electric conductor. Some cry'd-up the point; some commended the ball; The soft breath of Science was turn'd to a squall: The Sages no mental conductor could find To draw off the flame that now flash'd on their mind. In haste I exclaim'd, to the Learned adieu! For e'en Science offends, when she talks like a shrew. Having wander'd so wide of the object I sought, I was now led to think, and rejoic'd at the thought, This Goddess (herself for her charms so renown'd) With the daughters of Beauty must surely be found: With this hope I approach'd (unperceiv'd by them all) Three lovely young girls just array'd for the ball; In each, whose bright eyes on a mirror were bent, I thought I discover'd a spark of Content; But watching them more, in their beautiful faces, Of the Goddess I sought I no more saw the traces; For as they survey'd, with a critical glance, The elegant Montagu move in the dance, In her exquisite figure such graces were shown, That viewing her charms they distrusted their own. Thou gentlest of nymphs! while thy triumphs increase, Unconscious of beauty, so fatal to peace! Tho' the sparks of Content in one sex thou may'st smother, Bright Ecstasy's flame thou wilt raise in the other. If in bosom parental Content could reside, The heart of thy parent this treasure must hide; But, alas! 'tis a truth which all parents lament, Their tender anxiety stifles Content. O tell me, while vainly to find thee I pant, Dear latent Divinity! where is thy haunt? “Away to Batheaston,” Good-nature replies, “Behold she there weaves the poetical prize.” With thy Myrtle, kind Miller! O let me be crown'd, Then my search is repaid, and the Goddess is found: Nay, if to another your wreath you assign, And give it to verse far superior to mine, My search's dear object I still must attain; And the proof of this wonder 's exceedingly plain, It rests on this maxim, by Horace invented, The Bard who writes worst is the Bard most contented. My claim to this blessing thus made very clear, If I've nothing to hope, I have nothing to fear; For Miller can please while the mind she amuses, Both when she bestows, and e'en when she refuses; In truth I suspect, from her singular aim, The Goddess I seek is conceal'd by her name: She herself is Content, and her house is the fane, Where Spleen and Ill-nature no favours obtain: Some mortals in vain for admission must pray, But all who once enter go smiling away.

      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. Some notes have been omitted. AN ESSAY ON HISTORY; IN THREE EPISTLES TO EDWARD GIBBON, ESQ. ??? ???????? ??????? ??? ??? ???????? ??????????. Polybius, Lib, ii. EPISTLE THE FIRST ARGUMENT OF THE FIRST EPISTLE. Introduction.—Relation between History and Poetry— Decline of the latter.—Subject of the present Poem slightly touched by the Ancients.—Dionysius— Lucian.—Importance and advantage of History—its origin—subsequent to that of Poetry—disguised in its infancy by Priestcraft and Superstition—brought from Egypt into Greece.—Scarcity of great Historians—Perfect composition not to be expected.—Address to History, and Characters of many ancient Historians —Herodotus—Thucydides—Xenophon— Polybius—Sallust—Livy—Tacitus.— Biography—Plutarch.—Baleful influence of despotic power.—Ammianus Marcellinus—Anna Comnena. High in the world of Letters, and of Wit, Enthron'd like Jove, behold Opinion sit! As symbols of her sway, on either hand Th' unfailing urns of Praise and Censure stand; Their mingled streams her motley servants shed On each bold Author's self-devoted head. On thee, O Gibbon! in whose splendid page Rome shines majestic 'mid the woes of age, Mistaken Zeal, wrapt in a priestly pall, Has from the baser urn pour'd darkest gall: These stains to Learning would a Bard efface With tides of glory from the golden vase, But that he feels this nobler task require A spirit glowing with congenial fire— A Virgil only may uncensur'd aim To sing in equal verse a Livy's fame: Yet while Polemics, in fierce league combin'd, With savage discord vex thy feeling mind; And rashly stain Religion's just defence, By gross detraction and perverted sense; Thy wounded ear may haply not refuse The soothing accents of an humbler Muse. The lovely Science, whose attractive air Derives new charms from thy devoted care, Is near ally'd to that enchanting Art, Which reigns the idol of the Poet's heart. Tho' sister Goddesses, thy guardian maid Shines in the robe of fresher youth array'd, Like Pallas recent from the brain of Jove, When Strength with Beauty in her features strove; While elder Poesy, in every clime The flower of earliest fall, has past her prime: The bloom, which her autumnal cheeks supply, Palls on the Public's philosophic eye. What! tho' no more with Fancy's strong controul Her Epic wonders fascinate the soul; With humbler hopes, she wishes still to please By moral elegance, and labour'd ease: Like other Prudes, leaves Beauty's lost pretence, And strives to charm by Sentiment and Sense. Yet deaf to Envy's voice, and Pride's alarms, She loves the rival, who eclips'd her charms; Safe in thy favour, she would fondly stray Round the wide realm, which owns that Sister's sway, Sing the just fav'rites of historic fame, And mark their purest laws and noblest aim. My eyes with joy this pathless field explore, Cross'd by no Roman Bard, no Greeks of yore. Those mighty Lords of literary sway Have pass'd this province with a slight survey: E'en He, whose bold and comprehensive mind Immortal rules to Poesy assign'd, High Priest of Learning! has not fix'd apart The laws and limits of historic Art: Yet one excelling Greek in later days, The happy teacher of harmonious phrase, Whose patient fingers all the threads untwine, Which in the mystic chain of Music join; Strict Dionysius, of severest Taste, Has justly some historic duties trac'd, And some pure precepts into practice brought, Th' Historian proving what the Critic taught. And Lucian! thou, of Humour's sons supreme! Hast touch'd with liveliest art this tempting theme. When in the Roman world, corrupt and vain, Historic Fury madden'd every brain; When each base Greek indulg'd his frantic dream, And rose a Xenophon in self-esteem; Thy Genius satyriz'd the scribbling slave, And to the liberal pen just lessons gave: O skill'd to season, in proportion fit, Severer wisdom with thy sportive wit! Breathe thy strong power! thy sprightly grace infuse In the bold efforts of no servile Muse, If she transplant some lively flower, that throws Immortal sweetness o'er thy Attic Prose! In Egypt once a dread tribunal stood; Offspring of Wisdom! source of Public Good! Before this Seat, by holy Justice rear'd, The mighty Dead, in solemn pomp, appear'd; For till its sentence had their rights expos'd, The hallow'd portals of the tomb were clos'd; A sculptur'd form of Truth the Judges wore, A sacred emblem of the charge they bore! The claims of Virtue their pure voice exprest, And bade the opening grave receive its honor'd guest. Thus awefully array'd in Judgment's robe, With powers extensive as the peopled Globe; To her just bar impartial Hist'ry brings The gorgeous group of Statesmen, Heroes, Kings; With all whose minds, outshining splendid birth, Attract the notice of th' enlighten'd earth. From artful Pomp she strips the proud disguise That flash'd delusion in admiring eyes; To injur'd Worth gives Glory's wish'd reward, And blazons Virtue in her bright record: Nature's clear Mirror! Life's instructive Guide! Her wisdom sour'd by no preceptive Pride! Age from her lesson forms its wisest aim, And youthful Emulation springs to Fame. Yet thus adorn'd with noblest powers, design'd To charm, correct, and elevate mankind, From darkest Time her humble Birth she drew, And slowly into Strength and Beauty grew; As mighty streams, that roll with gather'd force, Spring feebly forth from some sequester'd source. The fond desire to pass the nameless crowd, Swept from the earth in dark Oblivion's cloud; Of transient life to leave some little trace, And win remembrance from the rising race, Led early Chiefs to make their prowess known By the rude symbol on the artless stone: And, long ere man the wondrous secret found, To paint the voice, and fix the fleeting sound, The infant Muse, ambitious at her birth, Rose the young herald of heroic worth. The tuneful record of her oral praise, The Sire's atchievements to the Son conveys: Keen Emulation, wrapt in trance sublime, Drinks with retentive ear the potent rhyme; And faithful Memory, from affection strong, Spreads the rich torrent of her martial song. Letters at length arise; but envious Night Conceals their blest Inventor from our sight. O'er the wide earth his spreading bounty flew, And swift those precious seeds of Science grew; Thence quickly sprung the Annal's artless frame, Time its chief boast! and brevity its aim! The Temple-wall preserv'd a simple date, And mark'd in plainest form the Monarch's fate. But in the center of those vast abodes, Whose mighty mass the land of Egypt loads; Where, in rude triumph over years unknown, Gigantic Grandeur, from his spiry throne, Seems to look down disdainful, and deride The poor, the pigmy toils of modern Pride; In the close covert of those gloomy cells, Where early Magic fram'd her venal spells, Combining priests, from many an ancient tale, Wove for their hallow'd use Religion's veil; A wondrous texture! supple, rich, and broad, To dazzle Folly, and to shelter Fraud! This, as her cæstus, Superstition wore; And saw th' enchanted world its powers adore: For in the mystic web was every charm To lure the timid, and the bold disarm; To win from easy Faith a blind esteem, And lull Devotion in a lasting dream. The Sorceress, to spread her empire, drest History's young form in this illusive vest, Whose infant voice repeated, as she taught, The motley fables on her mantle wrought; Till Attic Freedom brought the Foundling home From the dark cells of her Egyptian dome; Drew by degrees th' oppressive veil aside, And, shewing the fair Nymph in nature's pride, Taught her to speak, with all the fire of youth, The words of Wisdom in the tone of Truth: To catch the passing shew of public life, And paint immortal scenes of Grecian strife. Inchanting Athens! oft as Learning calls Our fond attention to thy fost'ring walls, Still with fresh joy thy glories we explore, With new idolatry thy charms adore. Bred in thy bosom, the Historian caught The warmest glow of elevated thought. Yet while thy triumphs to his eye display, The noblest scene his pencil can portray; While thy rich language, grac'd by every Muse, Supplies the brightest tints, his hand can use; How small their band, who, in thy happier days, Reach the bright summit of historic praise! 'Tis thus with every Art, in every age, From the mechanic to the moral sage: Excelling merit is by nature rare: Millions contend for crowns they cannot wear. Coy Science, in her scene of wide command, Bestows her honours with a sparing hand; Like Charlemain's proud host, her vassal crew No tongue can count—Her paladins are few. Pure, faultless writing, like transmuted gold, Mortals may wish, but never shall behold: Let Genius still this glorious object own, And seek Perfection's philosophic stone! For while the mind, in study's toilsome hours, Tries on the long research her latent powers, New wonders rise, to pay her patient thought, Inferior only to the prize she sought. But idle Pride no arduous labor sees, And deems th' Historian's toil a task of ease: Yet, if survey'd by Judgment's steady lamp, How few are justly grac'd with Glory's stamp! Tho' more these volumes, than the ruthless mind Of the fierce Omar to the flames consign'd, When Learning saw the savage with a smile Devote her offspring to the blazing pile! O History! whose pregnant mines impart Unfailing treasures to poetic art; The Epic gem, and those of darker hues, Whose trembling lustre decks the tragic Muse; If, justly conscious of thy powers, I raise A votive tablet to record thy praise, That ancient temple to my view unfold, Where thy first Sons, on Glory's list enroll'd, To Fancy's eye, in living forms, appear, And fill with Freedom's notes the raptur'd ear!— The dome expands!—Behold th' Historic Sire! Ionic roses mark his soft attire; Bold in his air, but graceful in his mien As the fair figure of his favour'd Queen, When her proud galley sham'd the Persian van, And grateful Xerxes own'd her more than man! Soft as the stream, whose dimpling waters play, And wind in lucid lapse their pleasing way, His rich, Homeric elocution flows, For all the Muses modulate his prose: Tho' blind Credulity his step misleads Thro' the dark mist of her Egyptian meads, Yet when return'd, with patriot passions warm, He paints the progress of the Persian storm, In Truth's illumin'd field, his labours rear A trophy worthy of the Spartan spear: His eager country, in th' Olympic vale, Throngs with proud joy to catch the martial tale. Behold! where Valour, resting on his lance, Drinks the sweet sound in rapture's silent trance, Then with a grateful shout of fond acclaim, Hails the just herald of his country's fame!— But mark the Youth, in dumb delight immers'd! See the proud tear of emulation burst! O faithful sign of a superior soul! Thy prayer is heard:—'tis thine to reach the goal. See! blest Olorus! see the palm is won! Sublimity and Wisdom crown thy Son: His the rich prize, that caught his early gaze, Th' eternal treasure of increasing praise! Pure from the stain of favor, or of hate, His nervous line unfolds the deep Debate; Explores the seeds of War; with matchless force Draws Discord, springing from Ambition's source, With all her Demagogues, who murder peace, In the fierce struggles of contentious Greece. Stript by Ingratitude of just command— Above resentment to a thankless land, Above all envy, rancour, pride, and spleen, In exile patient, in disgrace serene, And proud to celebrate, as Truth inspires, Each patriot Hero, that his soul admires— The deep-ton'd trumpet of renown he blows, In sage retirement 'mid the Thracian snows. But to untimely silence Fate devotes Those lips, yet trembling with imperfect notes, And base Oblivion threatens to devour E'en this first offspring of historic power. A generous guardian of a rival's fame, Mars the dark Fiend in this malignant aim: Accomplish'd Xenophon! thy truth has shewn A brother's glory sacred as thy own: O rich in all the blended gifts, that grace Minerva's darling sons of Attic race! The Sage's olive, the Historian's palm, The Victor's laurel, all thy name embalm! Thy simple diction, free from glaring art, With sweet allurement steals upon the heart; Pure as the rill, that Nature's hand refines, A cloudless mirror of thy soul it shines. Two passions there by soft contention please, The love of martial Fame, and learned Ease: These friendly colours, exquisitely join'd, Form the enchanting picture of thy mind. Thine was the praise, bright models to afford To Cæsar's rival pen, and rival sword: Blest, had Ambition not destroy'd his claim To the mild lustre of thy purer fame! Thou pride of Greece! in thee her triumphs end: And Roman chiefs in borrow'd pomp ascend. Rome's haughty genius, who enslav'd the Greek, In Grecian language deigns at first to speak: By slow degrees her ruder tongue she taught To tell the wonders that her valour wrought; And her historic host, with envious eye, View in their glittering van a Greek ally. Thou Friend of Scipio! vers'd in War's alarms! Torn from thy wounded country's struggling arms! And doom'd in Latian bosoms to instill Thy moral virtue, and thy martial skill! Pleas'd, in researches of elaborate length, To trace the fibres of the Roman strength! O highly perfect in each nobler part, The Sage's wisdom and the Soldier's art! This richer half of Grecian praise is thine: But o'er thy style the slighted Graces pine, And tir'd Attention toils thro' many a maze, To reach the purport of thy doubtful phrase: Yet large are his rewards, whore toils engage To clear the spirit of thy cloudy page; Like Indian fruit, its rugged rind contains Those milky sweets that pay the searcher's pains. Rome's haughty Genius, with exulting claim, Points to her rivals of the Grecian name! Sententious Sallust leads her lofty train; Clear, tho' concise, elaborately plain, Poising his scale of words with frugal care, Nor leaving one superfluous atom there! Yet well displaying, in a narrow space, Truth's native strength, and nature's easy grace; Skill'd to detect, in tracing Action's course, The hidden motive, and the human source. His lucid brevity the palm has won, By Rome's decision, from Olorus' Son. Of mightier spirit, of majestic frame, With powers proportion'd to the Roman fame, When Rome's fierce Eagle his broad wings unfurl'd, And shadow'd with his plumes the subject world, In bright pre-eminence, that Greece might own, Sublimer Livy claims th' Historic throne; With that rich Eloquence, whose golden light Brings the full scene distinctly to the sight; That Zeal for Truth, which Interest cannot bend, That Fire, which Freedom ever gives her friend. Immortal artist of a work supreme! Delighted Rome beheld, with proud esteem, Her own bright image, of Colossal size, From thy long toils in purest marble rise. But envious Time, with a malignant stroke, This sacred statue into fragments broke; In Lethe's stream its nobler portions sunk, And left Futurity the wounded trunk. Yet, like the matchless, mutilated frame, To which great Angelo bequeath'd his name, This glorious ruin, in whose strength we find The splendid vigour of the Sculptor's mind, In the fond eye of Admiration still Rivals the finish'd forms of modern skill. Next, but, O Livy! as unlike to thee, As the pent river to th' expanding sea, Sarcastic Tacitus, abrupt and dark, In moral anger forms the keen remark; Searching the soul with microscopic power, To mark the latent worm that mars the flower. His Roman voice, in base degenerate days, Spoke to Imperial Pride in Freedom's praise; And with indignant hate, severely warm, Shew'd to gigantic Guilt his ghastly form! There are, whose censures to his Style assign A subtle spirit, rigid and malign; Which magnified each monster that he drew, And gave to darkest vice a deeper hue: Yet his strong pencil shews the gentlest heart, In one sweet sketch of Biographic art, Whose softest tints, by filial love combin'd, Form the pure image of his Father's mind. O blest Biography! thy charms of yore Historic Truth to strong Affection bore; And fost'ring Virtue gave thee, as thy dower, Of both thy Parents the attractive power To win the heart, the wavering thought to fix, And fond delight with wise instruction mix. First of thy votaries, peerless, and alone, Thy Plutarch shines, by moral beauty known: Enchanting Sage! whose living lessons teach, What heights of Virtue human efforts reach. Tho' oft thy Pen, eccentrically wild, Ramble, in Learning's various maze beguil'd; Tho' in thy Style no brilliant graces shine, Nor the clear conduct of correct Design, Thy every page is uniformly bright With mild Philanthropy's diviner light. Of gentlest manners, as of mind elate, Thy happy Genius had the glorious fate To regulate, with Wisdom's soft controul, The strong ambition of a Trajan's soul. But O! how rare benignant Virtue springs In the blank bosom of despotic kings! Thou bane of liberal knowledge! Nature's curse! Parent of Misery! pamper'd Vice's nurse! Thou who canst bind, by thy petrific breath, The soul of Genius in the trance of death! Unbounded Power! beneath thy baleful sway, The voice of Hist'ry sinks in dumb decay. Still in thy gloomy reign one martial Greek, In Rome's corrupted language dares to speak; Mild Marcellinus! free from servile awe! A faithful painter of the woes he saw; Forc'd by the meanness of his age to join Adulterate Colours with his just Design! The slighted Attic Muse no more supplies Her pencil, dipt in Nature's purest dies; And Roman Emulation, at a stand, Drops the blurr'd pallet from her palsy'd hand. But while monastic Night, with gathering shades, The ruin'd realm of History invades; While, pent in Constantine's ill-fated walls, The mangled form of Roman Grandeur falls, And, like a Gladiator on the sand, Props his faint body with a dying hand; While savage Turks, or the fierce Sons of Thor, Wage on the Arts a wild Titanian war; While manly Knowledge hides his radiant head, As Jove in terror from the Titans fled; See! in the lovely charms of female youth, A second Pallas guards the throne of Truth! And, with Comnena's royal name imprest, The zone of Beauty binds her Attic vest! Fair star of Wisdom! whose unrival'd light Breaks thro' the stormy cloud of thickest night; Tho' in the purple of proud misery nurst, From those oppressive bands thy spirit burst; Pleas'd, in thy public labours, to forget The keen domestic pangs of fond regret! Pleas'd to preserve, from Time's destructive rage, A Father's virtues in thy faithful page! Too pure of soul to violate, or hide Th' Historian's duty in the Daughter's pride! Tho' base Oblivion long with envious hand Hid the fair volume which thy virtue plann'd, It shines, redeem'd from Ruin's darkest hour, A wond'rous monument of Female power; While conscious Hist'ry, careful of thy fame, Ranks in her Attic band thy filial name, And sees, on Glory's stage, thy graceful mien Close the long triumph of her ancient scene! END OF THE FIRST EPISTLE. EPISTLE THE SECOND. Sunt et alii Scriptores boni: sed nos genera degustamus, non bibliothecas excutimus, Quintil. Lib. x. ARGUMENT OF THE SECOND EPISTLE. Defects of the Monkish Historians—our obligations to the best of them.—Contrast between two of the most fabulous, and two of the most rational.—Indulgence due to Writers of the dark Ages.—Arabians—Abulfeda —Bohaddin.—Slow Progress of the human Mind.— Chivalry.—Froissart.—Revival of ancient Learning under Leo X.—Historians in Italy, Machiavel, Guicciardin, Davila, and Father Paul— in Portugal, Osorius—in Spain, Mariana—in Holland, Grotius—in France, Thuanus.— Praise of Toleration.—Voltaire.—Address to England.—Clarendon—Burnet—Rapin—Hume —Lyttelton.—Reason for not attempting to describe any living Historian. As eager Fossilists with ardour pore On the flat margin of the pebbled shore, Hoping some curious Shell, or Coral-root, Will pay the labours of their long pursuit; And yield their hand the pleasure to display Nature's neglected Gems in nice array: So, Gibbon! toils the mind, whose labour wades Thro' the dull Chronicle's monastic shades, To pick from that drear coast, with learned care, New shells of Knowledge, thinly scatter'd there; Who patient hears, while cloister'd Dullness tells The lying legend of her murky cells; Or strangely mingles, in her phrase uncouth, Disgusting Lies with unimportant Truth: How Bishops give (each tort'ring Fiend o'ercome) Life to the faint, and language to the dumb: How sainted Kings renounce, with holy dread, The chaste endearments of their marriage-bed: How Nuns, entranc'd, to joys celestial mount, Frantic with rapture from a sacred fount: How cunning Priests their dying Lord cajole, And take his riches to ensure his soul: While he endows them, in his pious will, With those choice gifts, the Meadow and the Mill, They wisely chronicle his Spirit's health, And give him Virtue in return for Wealth. So Hist'ry sinks, by Hypocrites deprest, In the coarse habit of the cloister drest; When her weak Sons that noxious air imbibe, Such are the tales of their monastic tribe! But let not Pride, with blind contempt, arraign Each early Writer in that humble train! No! let the Muse, a friend to every claim That marks the Candidate for honest fame, Be just to patient Worth, severely sunk, And paint the merits of the modest Monk! Ye purer minds! who stopt, with native force, Blind Ignorance in his barbarian course; Who, in the field of Hist'ry, dark and waste, Your simple path with steady patience trac'd; Blest be your labours! and your virtues blest! Tho' paid with insult, and with scorn opprest, Ye rescu'd Learning's lamp from total night, And sav'd with anxious toil the trembling light, In the wild storm of that tempestuous time, When Superstition cherish'd every crime; When meaner Priests pronounc'd with falt'ring tongue, Nor knew to read the jargon which they sung; When Nobles, train'd like blood-hounds to destroy, In ruthless rapine plac'd their savage joy; And Monarchs wanted ev'n the skill to frame The letters that compos'd their mighty name. How strong the mind, that, try'd by ills like these, Could write untainted with the Time's disease! That, free from Folly's lie, and Fraud's pretence, Could rise to simple Truth, and sober Sense! Such minds existed in the darkest hour Of blind Barbarity's debasing power. If mitred Turpin told, in wildest strain, Of giant-feats atchiev'd by Charlemain; Of spears, that blossom'd like the flowery thorn, Of Roland's magic sword, and ivory horn, Whose sound was wafted by an angel's wing, In notes of anguish, to his distant king; Yet modest Æginhard, with grateful care, In purer colours, and with Nature's air, Has drawn distinctly, in his clear record, A juster portrait of this mighty Lord, Whose forceful lance, against the Pagan hurl'd, Shone the bright terror of a barbarous world. Nor on his master does he idly shower The priestly gifts of supernat'ral Power: This candid Scribe of Gratitude and Truth, Correctly paints the Patron of his youth, Th' imperial Savage, whose unletter'd mind Was active, strong, beneficent, and kind; Who, tho' he lov'd the Learned to requite, Knew not that simplest art, the art to write. If British Geffrey fill'd his motley page With Merlin's spells, and Uther's amorous rage; With fables from the field of Magic glean'd, Giant and Dragon, Incubus and Fiend; Yet Life's great drama, and the Deeds of men, Sage Monk of Malm'sbury! engag'd thy pen. Nor vainly dost thou plead, in modest phrase, Thy manly passion for ingenuous praise: 'Twas thine the labours of thy Sires to clear From Fiction's harden'd spots, with toil severe; To form, with eyes intent on public life, Thy bolder sketches of internal strife; And warmly celebrate, with love refin'd, The rich endowments of thy Glo'ster's mind; May this, thy Praise, the Monkish pen exempt From the ungenerous blame of blind Contempt! Tho' Truth appear to make thy works her care, The lurking Prodigy still lingers there: But let not censure on thy name be thrown For errors, springing from thy Age alone! Shame on the Critic! who, with idle scorn, Depreciates Authors, in dark periods born, Who chance to want, irregularly bright, That equal Knowledge, and that steadier Light, Which Learning, in its full meridian power, Has richly lavish'd on his happier hour! Where martial tribes a warlike Despot own, And civil Freedom is a bliss unknown, In casual fits of intermitted strife, The Arts are summon'd into transient life: The royal mind supplies the quick'ning ray, And Science seems the insect of a day. Mark the fierce sons of many a savage horde, That from her fertile wilds Arabia pour'd! Behold them, as they range the subject earth, Now stifle Knowledge, and now give it birth! In Syrian Hamah, lo! a Prince presides, Whose faithful hand the pen of Hist'ry guides: Mild Abulfeda! whose rich merits claim No single wreath of literary Fame: The regions he describ'd, his talents boast, And Eastern Poets rank him in their host. In different climes behold an Arab Lord Crush the fair Art his brutal soul abhorr'd! And with that victim's blood his sabre stain, Who dar'd to write the annals of his reign! Yet in the land, that saw this savage deed, Arabian Science gain'd her richest meed: There Corduba, in hours of happier fate, Sublimely rose in academic state, Alike for Gallantry and Learning known, Asylum of the Arts, and Valour's throne! Ye turrets crescent-crown'd! the prey of Time! Bright scenes! that echoed with Arabian rhyme; Ere yet Oblivion's hateful curtain falls On the faint splendor of your prostrate walls, May some just hand your hidden wealth explore, The laurel to your letter'd Chiefs restore, To all your pomp a new existence give, And bid your glories in description live! The daring Moor, tho' robb'd of Freedom's rays, Glow'd with the noble avarice of praise; Keen as an Attic mind in Fame's pursuit, He shook, from Labour's tree, that golden fruit. Of all the heroes of the Moslem line, Triumphant Saladin! 'twas chiefly thine To cherish, in thy scenes of bloody strife, A just Encomiast of thy splendid life; Thy warm Bohaddin, with that generous zeal, Which no base sons of Adulation feel, At large delineates, with historic Art, Thy bold, intrepid mind, thy gentle heart. Tho' in his portrait, which reveals the Friend, The tints of Truth with those of Fondness blend, The picture, finish'd on no servile plan, Gives to our view the hero, and the man. Affliction speaks, all abject aims above, The tender Servant in the Scribe we love; Who shrinks, disabled by the gushing tear, From his last duty to a Lord so dear. Yet, tho' his bosom, touch'd with manly grief, Shar'd the mild virtue of his feeling Chief, His page betrays the bigot of the East, And lavish execrations mark the Priest. In all its various paths, the human Mind Feels the first efforts of its strength confin'd; And in the field, where History's laurels grow, Winds its long march with lingering step and slow: Like Fruit, whose taste to sweet luxuriance runs By constant succour from autumnal suns, This lovely Science ripens by degrees, And late is fashion'd into graceful ease. In those enlivening days, when Europe rose From the long pressure of lethargic woes; When the Provencal lyre, with roses drest, By ardent Love's extatic fingers prest, Wak'd into life the genius of the West; When Chivalry, her banners all unfurl'd, Fill'd with heroic fire the splendid world; In high-plum'd grandeur held her gorgeous reign, And rank'd each brilliant Virtue in her train; When she imparted, by her magic glove, To Honour strength, and purity to Love; New-moulded Nature on her noblest plan, And gave fresh sinews to the soul of man: When the chief model of her forming hand, Our sable Edward, on the Gallic strand, Display'd that spirit which her laws bestow, And shone the idol of his captive foe: Unblest with Arts, th' unletter'd age could yield No skilful hand, to paint from Glory's field Scenes that Humanity with pride must hear, And Admiration honour with a tear. Yet Courtesy, with generous Valour join'd, Fair Twins of Chivalry! rejoic'd to find A faithful Chronicler in plain Froissart; More rich in honesty than void of art. As the young Peasant, led by spirits keen To some great city's gay and gorgeous scene, Returning, with increase of proud delight, Dwells on the various splendor of the sight; And gives his tale, tho' told in terms uncouth, The charm of Nature, and the force of Truth, Tho' rude engaging; such thy simple page Seems, O Froissart! to this enlighten'd age. Proud of their spirit, in thy writings shewn, Fair Faith and Honour mark thee for their own; Tho' oft the dupe of those delusive times, Thy Genius, foster'd with romantic rhymes, Appears to play the legendary Bard, And trespass on the Truth it meant to guard. Still shall thy Name, with lasting glory, stand High on the list of that advent'rous band, Who, bidding History speak a modern tongue, From her cramp'd hand the Monkish fetters flung, While yet depress'd in Gothic night she lay, Nor saw th' approaching dawn of Attic day. On the blest banks of Tiber's honour'd stream Shone the first glance of that reviving beam; Enlighten'd Pontiffs, on the signal spot Where Science was proscrib'd, and Sense forgot, Bade Learning start from out her mould'ring tomb, And taught new laurels on her brow to bloom; Their Magic voice invok'd all Arts, and all Sprung into glory at the potent call. As in Arabia's waste, where Horror reigns, Gigantic tyrant of the burning plains! The glorious bounty of some Royal mind, By Heaven inspir'd, and friend to human kind, Bids the rich Structure of refreshment rise, To chear the Traveller's despairing eyes; Who sees with rapture the new fountains burst, And, as he slakes his soul-subduing thirst, Blesses the hand which all his pains beguil'd, And rais'd an Eden in the dreary wild: Such praises, Leo! to thy name are due, From all who Learning's cultur'd field review, And to its Fountain, in thy liberal heart, Trace the diffusive Stream of modern Art. 'Twas not thy praise to animate alone The speaking Canvass, and the breathing Stone, Or tides of Bounty round Parnassus roll, To quicken Genius in the Poet's soul; Thy Favour, like the Sun's prolific ray, Brought the keen Scribe of Florence into Day; Whose subtle Wit discharg'd a dubious shaft, At once the Friend and Foe of Kingly Craft. Tho', in his maze of Politics perplext, Great Names have differ'd on that doubtful text; Here crown'd with praise, as true to Virtue's side, There view'd with horror, as th' Assassin's guide; High in a purer sphere, he shines afar, And hist'ry hails him as her Morning-star. Nor less, O Leo! was it thine to raise The great Historic Chief of modern days, The solemn Guicciardin, whose pen severe, Unsway'd by favour, nor restrain'd by fear, Mark'd in his close of life, with keen disdain, Each fatal blemish in thy motley reign; Who, like Olorus' Son, of spirit chaste, And form'd to martial toils, minutely trac'd The woes he saw his bleeding country bear, And wars, in which he claim'd no trivial share. With equal wreaths let Davila be crown'd, Alike in letters and in arms renown'd! Who, from his country driv'n by dire mischance, Plung'd in the civil broils of bleeding France. Maintaining still, in Party's raging sea, His judgment steady, and his spirit free; Save when the fierce religion of his Sires Drown'd the soft zeal Humanity inspires: Who boldly wrote, with such a faithful hand, The tragic story of that foreign land, The hoary Gallic Chief, whose tranquil age Listen'd with joy to his recording page, Tracing the scenes familiar to his youth, Gave his strong sanction to th' Historian's truth. Oh Italy! tho' drench'd with civil blood, Tho' drown'd in Bigotry's soul-quenching flood, Historic Genius, in thy troubles nurst, Ev'n from the darkness of the Convent burst, Venice may boast eternal Honour, won By the bright labours of her dauntless Son, Whose hand the curtains of the Conclave drew, And gave each priestly art to public view. Sarpi, blest name! from every foible clear, Not more to Science than to Virtue dear. Thy pen, thy life, of equal praise secure! Both wisely bold, and both sublimely pure! That Freedom bids me on thy merits dwell, Whose radiant form illum'd thy letter'd cell; Who to thy hand the noblest task assign'd, That earth can offer to a heavenly mind: With Reason's arms to guard invaded laws, And guide the pen of Truth in Freedom's cause. Too firm of heart at Danger's cry to stoop, Nor Lucre's slave, nor vain Ambition's dupe, Thro' length of days invariably the same Thy Country's liberty thy constant aim! For this thy spirit dar'd th' Assassin's knife, That with repeated guilt pursu'd thy life; For this thy fervent and unweary'd care Form'd, even in death, thy patriotic prayer, And, while his shadows on thine eye-lids hung, “Be it immortal!” trembled on thy tongue. But not restricted, by the partial Fates, To the bright cluster of Italian States, The light of Learning, and of liberal Taste, Diffusely shone o'er Europe's Gothic waste. On Tagus' shore, from whose admiring strand Great Gama sail'd, when his advent'rous hand The flag of glorious enterprize unfurl'd, To purchase with his toils the Eastern world, The clear Osorius, in his classic phrase, Portray'd the Heroes of those happier days, When Lusitania, once a mighty name, Outstripp'd each rival in the chace of Fame: Mild and majestic, her Historian's page Shares in the glory of her brightest age. Iberia's Genius bids just Fame allow As bright a wreath to Mariana's brow: Skill'd to illuminate the distant scene, In diction graceful, and of spirit keen, His labour, by his country's love endear'd, The gloomy chaos of her Story clear'd. He first aspir'd its scatter'd parts to class, And bring to juster form the mighty mass; As the nice hand of Geographic art Draws the vast globe on a contracted chart, Where Truth uninjur'd sees, with glad surprize, Her shape still perfect, tho' of smaller size. Exalted Mind! who felt the People's right, In climes, where souls are crush'd by Kingly might; And dar'd, unaw'd before a tyrant's throne, To make the fanctity of Freedom known! But short, O Genius! is thy transient hour, In the dark regions of despotic Power. As the faint struggle of the solar beam, When vapours intercept the golden stream, Pouring thro' parted clouds a glancing fire, Plays, in short triumph, on some glittering spire; But while the eye admires the partial ray, The pale and watery lustre melts away: Thus gleams of literary splendor play'd, And thus on Spain's o'erclouded realm decay'd: While Holland, Liberty's immediate care, Defy'd the pressure of Bœotian air, Burst the oppressive gloom around her hurl'd, And drew attention from th' admiring world. When, by long toils, her dauntless warriors broke Their Spanish bonds, and spurn'd a bloody yoke, In the bright moments of that blessed hour, With talents equal to his Country's power, The fervid Grotius to her glory rais'd A column, splendid as the feats he prais'd; Stifled his just resentment, to bestow A clear encomium on his private foe, And honour'd in the Chief, who sav'd the State, The rash oppressor, who provok'd his hate, Thou all-accomplish'd Youth! whose early page Charm'd the astonish'd eye of learned Age, Let admiration of thy worth inspire Such liberal praise, as echoed from thy lyre, When Honour crown'd, by thy poetic hand, The far-fam'd Scholar of thy native land! Learning ne'er saw, in all her numerous race, A son more worthy of her fond embrace: Thy mind expanded to her empire's bound; There every Science a firm station found; There gay and grave, in rare assemblage, shone; A wonder, equall'd by thy heart alone! For, by enlighten'd Faith's presiding care, The rival Virtues were all marshall'd there. Worth so transcendent, Heaven with smiles survey'd, And with the choicest of its gifts repaid; Gave thee a Partner of thy chequer'd fate, Pure as thy Genius, and as firmly great; With equal love, with equal courage warm, A kindred Spirit in a softer form: Thy dear Maria shar'd thy captive hour, She brav'd the vengeance of offended power; And, with the fondness of Admetus' wife, Restor'd thy freedom at the risk of life: Her days were guarded by the Powers above; And thy just lyre immortaliz'd her love. Ye peerless Couple! tho' with wrongs opprest, In virtue happy, and by union blest, From Fame's fond lips your blended praise shall flow, While Excellence can find a friend below; While Love's chaste fires thro' human bosoms roll; While Liberty and Truth delight the soul! Your names, applauded by the spacious earth, Still dignify the land that boasts your birth; Tho' her tame Genius, Wealth's more willing slave, Soon lost that mental fire, which Freedom gave, Whose brilliant flame in sickly languor dies, Where'er the damps of Avarice arise: Hence, tho' less free, yet true to Honour's aim, France is more opulent in letter'd fame. There, in the dignity of virtuous Pride, Thro' painful scenes of public service try'd, And keenly conscious of his Country's woes, The liberal spirit of Thuanus rose: O'er Earth's wide stage a curious eye he cast, And caught the living pageant as it past: With patriot care most eager to advance The rights of Nature, and the weal of France! His language noble, as his temper clear From Faction's rage, and Superstition's fear! In Wealth laborious! amid Wrongs sedate! His Virtue lovely, as his Genius great! Ting'd with some marks, that from his climate spring, He priz'd his Country, but ador'd his King; Yet with a zeal from slavish awe refin'd, Shone the clear model of a Gallic mind. Thou friend of Science! 'twas thy signal praise, A just memorial of her Sons to raise; To blazon first, on Hist'ry's brighter leaf, The laurel'd Writer with the laurel'd Chief! But O! pure Spirit! what a fate was thine! How Truth and Reason at thy wrongs repine! How blame thy King, tho' rob'd in Honour's ray, Who left thy Fame to subtle Priests a prey, And tamely saw their murky wiles o'erwhelm Thy works, the light of his reviving realm! Tho' Pontiffs execrate, and Kings betray, Let not this fate your generous warmth allay, Ye kindred Worthies! who still dare to wield Reason's keen sword, and Toleration's shield, In climes where Persecution's iron mace Is rais'd to massacre the human race! The heart of Nature will your virtue feel, And her immortal voice reward your zeal: First in her praise her fearless champions live, Crown'd with the noblest palms that earth can give. Firm in this band, who to her aid advance, And high amid th' Historic sons of France, Delighted Nature saw, with partial care, The lively vigour of the gay Voltaire; And fondly gave him, with Anacreon's fire, To throw the hand of Age across the lyre: But mute that vary'd voice, which pleas'd so long! Th' Historian's tale is clos'd, the Poet's song! Within the narrow tomb behold him lie, Who fill'd so large a space in Learning's eye! Thou Mind unweary'd! thy long toils are o'er; Censure and Praise can touch thy ear no more: Still let me breathe with just regret thy name, Lament thy foibles, and thy powers proclaim! On the wide sea of Letters 'twas thy boast To croud each sail, and touch at every coast: From that rich deep how often hast thou brought The pure and precious pearls of splendid Thought! How didst thou triumph on that subject-tide, Till Vanity's wild gust, and stormy Pride, Drove thy strong bark, in evil hour, to split Upon the fatal rock of impious Wit! But be thy failings cover'd by thy tomb! And guardian laurels o'er thy ashes bloom! From the long annals of the world thy art, With chemic process, drew the richer part; To Hist'ry gave a philosophic air, And made the interest of mankind her care; Pleas'd her grave brow with garlands to adorn, And from the rose of Knowledge strip the thorn. Thy lively Eloquence, in prose, in verse, Still keenly bright, and elegantly terse, Flames with bold spirit; yet is idly rash: Thy promis'd light is oft a dazzling flash; Thy Wisdom verges to sarcastic sport, Satire thy joy! and ridicule thy forte! But the gay Genius of the Gallic soil, Shrinking from solemn tasks of serious toil, Thro' every scene his playful air maintains, And in the light Memoir unrival'd reigns, Thy Wits, O France! (as e'en thy Critics own) Support not History's majestic tone; They, like thy Soldiers, want, in feats of length, The persevering soul of British strength. Hail to thee, Britain! hail! delightful land! I spring with filial joy to reach thy strand: And thou! blest nourisher of Souls, sublime As e'er immortaliz'd their native clime, Rich in Poetic treasures, yet excuse The trivial offering of an humble Muse, Who pants to add, with fears by love o'ercome, Her mite of Glory to thy countless sum! With vary'd colours, of the richest dye, Fame's brilliant banners o'er thy Offspring fly: In native Vigour bold, by Freedom led, No path of Honour have they fail'd to tread: But while they wisely plan, and bravely dare, Their own atchievements are their latest care. Tho' Camden, rich in Learning's various store, Sought in Tradition's mine Truth's genuine ore, The waste of Hist'ry lay in lifeless shade, Tho' Rawleigh's piercing eye that world survey'd. Tho' mightier Names there cast a casual glance, They seem'd to saunter round the field by chance, Till Clarendon arose, and in the hour When civil Discord wak'd each mental Power, With brave desire to reach this distant Goal, Strain'd all the vigour of his manly soul. Nor Truth, nor Freedom's injur'd Powers, allow A wreath unspotted to his haughty brow: Friendship's firm spirit still his fame exalts, With sweet atonement for his lesser faults. His Pomp of Phrase, his Period of a mile, And all the maze of his bewilder'd Style, Illum'd by Warmth of Heart, no more offend: What cannot Taste forgive, in Falkland's friend? Nor flow his praises from this single source; One province of his art displays his force: His Portraits boast, with features strongly like, The soft precision of the clear Vandyke: Tho', like the Painter, his faint talents yield, And sink embarrass'd in the Epic field. Yet shall his labours long adorn our Isle, Like the proud glories of some Gothic pile: They, tho' constructed by a Bigot's hand, Nor nicely finish'd, nor correctly plann'd, With solemn Majesty, and pious Gloom, An awful influence o'er the mind assume; And from the alien eyes of every Sect Attract observance, and command respect. In following years, when thy great name, Nassau! Stampt the blest deed of Liberty and Law; When clear, and guiltless of Oppression's rage, There rose in Britain an Augustan age, And cluster'd Wits, by emulation bright, Diffus'd o'er Anna's reign their mental light; That Constellation seem'd, tho' strong its flame, To want the splendor of Historic fame: Yet Burnet's page may lasting glory hope, Howe'er insulted by the spleen of Pope. Tho' his rough Language haste and warmth denote, With ardent Honesty of Soul he wrote; Tho' critic censures on his work may shower, Like Faith, his Freedom has a saving power. Nor shalt thou want, Rapin! thy well-earn'd praise; The sage Polybius thou of modern days! Thy Sword, thy Pen, have both thy name endear'd; This join'd our Arms, and that our Story clear'd: Thy foreign hand discharg'd th' Historian's trust, Unsway'd by Party, and to Freedom just. To letter'd fame we own thy fair pretence, From patient Labour, and from candid Sense. Yet Public Favour, ever hard to fix, Flew from thy page, as heavy and prolix. For soon, emerging from the Sophists' school, With Spirit eager, yet with Judgment cool, With subtle skill to steal upon applause, And give false vigour to the weaker cause; To paint a specious scene with nicest art, Retouch the whole, and varnish every part; Graceful in Style, in Argument acute; Master of every trick in keen Dispute! With these strong powers to form a winning tale, And hide Deceit in Moderation's veil, High on the pinnacle of Fashion plac'd, Hume shone the idol of Historic Taste. Already, pierc'd by Freedom's searching rays, The waxen fabric of his fame decays.— Think not, keen Spirit! that these hands presume To tear each leaf of laurel from thy tomb! These hands! which, if a heart of human frame Could stoop to harbour that ungenerous aim, Would shield thy Grave, and give, with guardian care, Each type of Eloquence to flourish there! But Public Love commands the painful task, From the pretended Sage to strip the mask, When his false tongue, averse to Freedom's cause, Profanes the spirit of her antient laws. As Asia's soothing opiate Drugs, by stealth, Shake every slacken'd nerve, and sap the health; Thy Writings thus, with noxious charms refin'd, Seeming to soothe its ills, unnerve the Mind. While the keen cunning of thy hand pretends To strike alone at Party's abject ends, Our hearts more free from Faction's Weeds we feel, But they have loft the Flower of Patriot Zeal. Wild as thy feeble Metaphysic page, Thy Hist'ry rambles into Sceptic rage; Whose giddy and fantastic dreams abuse A Hampden's Virtue, and a Shakespear's Muse. With purer Spirit, free from Party strife, To soothe his evening hour of honour'd life, See candid Lyttelton at length unfold The deeds of Liberty in days of old! Fond of the theme, and narrative with age, He winds the lengthen'd tale thro' many a page; But there the beams of Patriot Virtue shine; There Truth and Freedom sanctify the line, And laurels, due to Civil Wisdom, shield This noble Nestor of th' Historic field. The living Names, who there display their power, And give its glory to the present hour, I pass with mute regard; in fear to fail, Weighing their worth in a suspected scale: Thy right, Posterity! I sacred hold, To fix the stamp on literary Gold: Blest! if this lighter Ore, which I prepare For thy supreme Assay, with anxious care, Thy current sanction unimpeach'd enjoy, As only tinctur'd with a slight alloy! END OF THE SECOND EPISTLE. EPISTLE THE THIRD. Ventum est ad partem operis destinati longe gravissimam— nunc quoque, licet major quam unquam moles premat, tamen prospicienti finem mihi constitutum est vel deficere potius, quam desperare—nostra temeritas etiam mores ei conabitur dare, et assignabit officia. Quintil. Lib. xii. ARGUMENT OF THE THIRD EPISTLE. The sources of the chief defects in History—Vanity, national and private—Flattery, and her various arts— Party-spirit—Superstition—and false Philosophy.— Character of the accomplish'd Historian.—The Laws of History.—Style.—Importance of the subject.— Failure of Knolles from a subject ill-chosen.—Danger of dwelling on the distant and minute parts of a subject really interesting—Failure of Milton in this particular.—The worst defect of an Historian, a system of Tyranny—Instance in Brady.—Want of a General History of England: Wish for its accomplishment.—Use and Delight of other Histories—of Rome.—Labour of the Historian—Cavils against him.—Concern for Gibbon's irreligious spirit— The idle censure of his passion for Fame—Defence of that passion.—Conclusion. Say thou! whose eye has, like the Lynx's beam, Pierc'd the deep windings of this mazy stream, Say, from what source the various Poisons glide, That darken History's discolour'd tide; Whose purer waters to the mind dispense The wealth of Virtue, and the fruits of Sense!— These Poisons flow, collective and apart, From Public Vanity, and Private Art. At first Delusion built her safe retreat On the broad base of National Conceit: Nations, like Men, in Flattery confide, The slaves of Fancy, and the dupes of Pride. Each petty region of the peopled earth, Howe'er debas'd by intellectual dearth, Still proudly boasted of her claims to share The richest portion of celestial care: For her she saw the rival Gods engage, And Heaven convuls'd with elemental rage. To her the thunder's roar, the lightning's fire, Confirm'd their favour, or denounc'd their ire. To seize this foible, daring Hist'ry threw Illusive terrors o'er each scene she drew; Nor would her spirit, in the heat of youth, Watch, with a Vestal's care, the lamp of Truth; But, wildly mounting in a Witch's form, Her voice delighted to condense the storm; With showers of blood th' astonish'd earth to drench, The frame of Nature from its base to wrench; In Horror's veil involve her plain events, And shake th' affrighted world with dire portents. Still softer arts her subtle spirit try'd, To win the easy faith of Public Pride: She told what Powers, in times of early date, Gave consecration to the infant State; Mark'd the blest spot by sacred Founders trod, And all th' atchievements of the guardian God. Thus while, like Fame, she rests upon the land, Her figure grows; her magic limbs expand; Her tow'ring head, to high Olympus tost, Pierces the sky, and in that blaze is lost. Yet bold Philosophy at length destroy'd The brilliant phantoms of th' Historic void; Her scrutinizing eye, whose search severe Rivals the pressure of Ithuriel's spear, Permits no fraudful semblance to escape, But turns each Marvel to its real shape. The blazing meteors fall from Hist'ry's sphere; Her darling Demi-gods no more appear; No more the Nations, with heroic joy, Boast their descent from Heaven-descended Troy: On Francio now the Gallic page is mute, And British Story drops the name of Brute. What other failings from this fountain flow'd, Ill-measur'd fame on martial feats bestow'd, And heaps, enlarg'd to mountains of the slain, The miracles of valour, still remain. But of all faults, that injur'd Truth may blame, Those proud mistakes the first indulgence claim, Where Public Zeal the ardent Pen betrays, And Patriot Passions swell the partial praise. Ev'n private Vanity may pardon find, When built on Worth, and with Instruction join'd: In British Annalists more rarely found, This venial foible springs on foreign ground: 'Tis theirs, who scribble near the Seine or Loire, Those lively Heroes of the light Memoir! Defects more hateful to ingenuous eyes, In Adulation's servile arts arise: Mean Child of Int'rest! as her Parent base! Her charms Deformity! her wealth Disgrace! Dimm'd by her breath, the light of Learning fades; Her breath the wisest of mankind degrades, And Bacon's self, for mental glory born, Meets, as her slave, our pity, or our scorn. Unhappy Genius! in whose wond'rous mind The sordid Reptile and the Seraph join'd; Now traversing the world on Wisdom's wings, Now basely crouching to the last of Kings: Thy fault, which Freedom with regret surveys, This useful Truth, in strongest light, displays; That not sufficient are those shining parts, Which shed new radiance o'er concenter'd arts; To reach with glory the Historic goal Demands a firm, an independent soul, An eagle-eye, that with undazzled gaze Can look on Majesty's meridian blaze. But Adulation, in the worst of times, Throws her broad mantle o'er imperial crimes; In Hist'ry's field, her abject toils delight To shut the scenes of Nature from our sight, Each human Virtue in one mass to fling, And of that mountain make the statue of a King. Yet oft her labours, slighted or abhorr'd, Receive in present scorn their just reward; Scorn from that Idol, at whose feet she lays The sordid offering of her venal praise. As crown'd with Indian laurels, nobly won, His conquest ended, Philip's warlike Son Sail'd down th' Hydaspes in a voyage of sport, The chief Historian of his sumptuous court Read his description of the single fight, Where Porus yielded to young Ammon's might; And, like a Scribe in courtly arts adroit, Most largely magnify'd his Lord's exploit: Tho' ever on the stretch to Glory's goal, Fame the first passion of his fiery soul! Fierce from his seat the indignant Hero sprung, And o'er the vessel's side the volume flung; Then, as he saw the fawning Scribbler shrink, “Thus should the Author with his Writing sink, “Who stifles Truth in Flattery's disguise, “And buries honest Fame beneath a load of Lies.” But modern Princes, having less to lose, Rarely these insults on their name accuse: In Dedications quietly inurn'd, They take more lying Praise than Ammon spurn'd, And Learning's pliant Sons, to flattery prone, Bend with such blind obeisance to the throne, The basest King that ever curst the earth, Finds many a witness to attest his worth: Tho' dead, still flatter'd by some abject slave, He spreads contagious poison from his grave, While sordid hopes th' Historian's hand entice To varnish ev'n the tomb of Royal Vice. Tho' Nature wept with desolated Spain, In tears of blood, the second Philip's reign; Tho' such deep sins deform'd his sullen mind, As merit execration from mankind: A mighty empire by his crimes undone; A people massacred; a murder'd son: Tho' Heaven's displeasure stopt his parting breath, To bear long loathsome pangs of hideous death; Flattery can still the Ruffian's praise repeat, And call this Waster of the earth discreet: Still can Herrera, mourning o'er his urn, His dying pangs to blissful rapture turn, And paint the King, from earth by curses driven, A Saint, accepted by approving Heaven! But arts of deeper guile, and baser wrong, To Adulation subtle Scribes belong: They oft, their present idols to exalt, Profanely burst the consecrated vault; Steal from the buried Chief bright Honour's plume, Or stain with Slander's gall the Statesman's tomb: Stay, sacrilegious slaves! with reverence tread O'er the blest ashes of the worthy dead! See! where, uninjur'd by the charnel's damp, The Vestal, Virtue, with undying lamp, Fond of her toil, and jealous of her trust, Sits the keen Guardian of their sacred dust, And thus indignant, from the depth of earth, Checks your vile aim, and vindicates their worth: “Hence ye! who buried excellence belied, “To sooth the sordid spleen of living Pride; “Go! gild with Adulation's feeble ray “Th' imperial pageant of your passing day! “Nor hope to stain, on base Detraction's scroll, “A Tully's morals, or a Sidney's soul!”— Just Nature will abhor, and Virtue scorn, That Pen, tho' eloquence its page adorn, Which, brib'd by Interest, or from vain pretence To subtler Wit, and deep-discerning Sense, Would blot the praise on public toils bestow'd, And Patriot passions, as a jest, explode. Less abject failings spring from Party-rage, The pest most frequent in th' Historic page; That common jaundice of the turbid brain, Which leaves the heart unconscious of a stain, Yet suffers not the clouded mind to view Or men, or actions, in their native hue: For Party mingles, in her feverish dreams, Credulity and Doubt's most wild extremes: She gazes thro' a glass, whose different ends Reduce her foes, and magnify her friends: Delusion ever on her spirit dwells; And to the worst excess its fury swells, When Superstition's raging passions roll Their savage frenzy thro' the Bigot's soul. Nor less the blemish, tho' of different kind, From false Philosophy's conceits refin'd! Her subtle influence, on History shed, Strikes the fine nerve of Admiration dead, (That nerve despis'd by sceptic sons of earth, Yet still a vital spring of human worth.) This artful juggler, with a skill so nice, Shifts the light forms of Virtue and of Vice, That, ere they wake abhorrence or delight, Behold! they both are vanish'd from the sight; And Nature's warm affections, thus destroy'd, Leave in the puzzled mind a lifeless void. Far other views the liberal Genius fire, Whose toils to pure Historic praise aspire; Nor Moderation's dupe, nor Faction's brave, Nor Guilt's apologist, nor Flattery's slave: Wise, but not cunning; temperate, not cold; Servant of Truth, and in that service bold; Free from all bias, save that just controul By which mild Nature sways the manly soul, And Reason's philanthropic spirit draws To Virtue's interest, and Freedom's cause; Those great ennoblers of the human name, Pure springs of Power, of Happiness, and Fame! To teach their influence, and spread their sway, The just Historian winds his toilsome way; From silent darkness, creeping o'er the earth, Redeems the sinking trace of useful worth; In Vice's bosom marks the latent thorn, And brands that public pest with public scorn. A lively teacher in a moral school! In that great office steady, clear, and cool! Pleas'd to promote the welfare of mankind, And by informing meliorate the mind! Such the bright task committed to his care! Boundless its use; but its completion rare. Critics have said, “Tho' high th' Historian's charge, His Laws are simple tho' his Province large; Two obvious rules ensure his full success— To speak no Falsehood; and no Truth suppress: Art must to other works a lustre lend, But History pleases, howsoe'er it's penn'd.” Perchance in ruder periods; but in those, Where all the luxury of Learning flows, To Truth's plain fare no palate will submit, Each reader grows an Epicure in Wit; And Knowledge must his nicer taste beguile With all the poignant charms of Attic style. The curious Scholar, in his judgment choice, Expects no common Notes from History's voice; But all the tones, that all the passions suit, From the bold Trumpet to the tender Lute: Yet if thro' Music's scale her voice should range, Now high, now low, with many a pleasing change, Grace must thro' every variation glide, In every movement Majesty preside: With ease not careless, tho' correct not cold; Soft without languor, without harshness bold. Tho' Affectation can all works debase, In Language, as in Life, the bane of Grace! Regarded ever with a scornful smile, She most is censur'd in th' Historic style: Yet her insinuating power is such, Not ev'n the Greeks escap'd her baleful touch; Hence the fictitious Speech, and long Harangue, Too oft, like weights, on ancient Story hang. Less fond of labour, modern Pens devise Affected beauties of inferior size: They in a narrower compass boldly strike The fancied Portrait, with no feature like; And Nature's simple colouring vainly quit, To boast the brilliant glare of fading Wit. Those works alone may that blest fate expect To live thro' time, unconscious of neglect, That catch, in springing from no sordid source, The ease of Nature, and of Truth the force. But not ev'n Truth, with bright expression grac'd, Nor all Description's powers, in lucid order plac'd, Not even these a fond regard engage, Or bind attention to th' Historic page, If distant tribes compose th' ill-chosen Theme, Whose savage virtues wake no warm esteem; Where Faith and Valour spring from Honour's grave, Only to form th' Assassin and the Slave. From Turkish tyrants, stain'd with servile gore, Enquiry turns; and Learning's sighs deplore, While o'er his name Neglect's cold shadow rolls, A waste of Genius in the toil of Knolles. There are, we own, whose magic power is such, Their hands embellish whatsoe'er they touch: Their bright Mosaic so enchants our eyes, By nice Arrangement, and contrasted Dies, What mean materials in the texture lurk, Serve but to raise the wonder of the work. Yet from th' Historian (as such power is rare) The choice of Matter claims no trifling care. 'Tis not alone collected Wealth's display, Nor the proud fabric of extended Sway, That mark (tho' both the eye of Wonder fill) The happy Subject for Historic skill: Wherever Nature, tho' in narrow space, Fosters, by Freedom's aid, a liberal race; Sees Virtue save them from Oppression's den, And cries with exultation, “These are Men;” Tho' in Bœotia or Batavia born, Their deeds the Story of the World adorn. The Subject fix'd, with force and beauty fraught, Just Disposition claims yet deeper thought; To cast enlivening Order's lucid grace O'er all the crouded fields of Time and Space; To shew each wheel of Power in all its force, And trace the streams of Action from their source; To catch, with spirit and precision join'd, The varying features of the human Mind; The Grace, the Strength, that Nature's children draw From Arts, from Science, Policy, and Law; Opinion's fashion, Wisdom's firmer plan, And all that marks the character of Man. Of all the parts, that History's volume fill, The just Digression claims the nicest skill; As the swift Hero, in the Olympic race, Ran with less toil along the open space; But round the Goal to form the narrow curve, Call'd forth his utmost strength from every nerve. The Subject's various powers let Study tell! And teach th' Historian on what points to dwell! How in due shades to sink each meaner part, And pour on nobler forms the radiance of his art! Tho' Patriot Love the curious spirit fires With thirst to hear th' atchievements of his Sires; And British story wins the British mind With all the charms that fond attention bind; Its early periods, barbarous and remote, Please not, tho' drawn by Pens of noblest note: O'er those rude scenes Confusion's shadows dwell, Beyond the power of Genius to dispell; Mists! which ev'n Milton's splendid mind enshroud; Lost in the darkness of the Saxon cloud! Neglect alone repays their flight offence, Whose wand'ring wearies our bewilder'd sense: But just Abhorrence brands his guilty name, Who dares to vilify his Country's fame; With Slander's rage the pen of History grasp, And pour from thence the poison of the Asp; The murd'rous falsehood, stifling Honour's breath! The slavish tenet, Public Virtue's death! With all that undermines a Nation's health, And robs the People of their richest wealth! Ye tools of Tyranny! whose servile guile Would thus pollute the records of our isle, Behold your Leader curst with public hate, And read your just reward in Brady's fate! O sacred Liberty! shall Faction's train Pervert the reverend archives of thy reign? Shall slaves traduce the blood thy votaries spilt, Blaspheming Glory with the name of Guilt? And shall no Son of thine their wiles o'erwhelm, And clear the story of thy injur'd realm? To this bright task some British spirit raise, With powers surpassing ev'n a Livy's praise! Thro' this long wilderness his march inspire, And make thy temperate flame his leading fire! Teach his keen eye, and comprehensive soul, To pierce each darker part, and grasp the whole! Let Truth's undoubted signet seal his page, And Glory guard the work from age to age! That British minds from this pure source may draw Sense of thy Rights, and passion for thy Law, Wisdom to prize, and Honour, that aspires To reach that virtue which adorn'd our Sires! But not alone our native land attracts; Far different Nations boast their splendid facts: In ancient Story the rich fruits unite Of civil Wisdom and sublime Delight. At Rome's proud name Attention's spirits rise, Rome, the first idol of our infant eyes! Use and Importance mark the vast design, Clearly to trace her periods of Decline. Yet here, O Gibbon! what long toils ensue? How winds the labyrinth? how fails the clue? Tho' rude materials Time's deep trenches fill, A radiant structure rises from thy skill; Whose splendor, springing from a dreary waste, Enchants the wondering eye of Public Taste. Thus to the ancient traveller, whose way Across the hideous sands of Syria lay, The Desart blaz'd with sudden glory bright; And rich Palmyra rush'd upon his sight. But O! what foes beset each honour'd Name, Advancing in the path of letter'd fame! To stop thy progress, and insult thy pen, The fierce Polemic issues from his den. Think not my Verse means blindly to engage In rash defence of thy profaner page! Tho' keen her spirit, her attachment fond, Base service cannot suit with Friendship's bond; Too firm from Duty's facred path to turn, She breathes an honest sigh of deep concern, And pities Genius, when his wild career Gives Faith a wound, or Innocence a fear. Humility herself, divinely mild, Sublime Religion's meek and modest child, Like the dumb Son of Croesus, in the strife, Where Force assail'd his Father's sacred life, Breaks silence, and, with filial duty warm, Bids thee revere her Parent's hallow'd form! Far other sounds the ear of Learning stun, From proud Theology's contentious Son; Less eager to correct, than to revile, Rage in his voice! and Rancour in his style! His idle scoffs with coarse reproof deride Thy generous thirst of Praise, and liberal Pride; Since thy frank spirit dares that wish avow, Which Nature owns, and Wisdom must allow! The noble Instinct, Love of lasting Fame, Was wisely planted in the human frame: From hence the brightest rays of History flow; To this their Vigour and their Use they owe. Nor scorns fair Virtue this untainted source, From hence she often draws her lovely force: For Heaven this passion with our life combin'd, Which, like a central power, impels the languid mind. When, clear from Envy's cloud, that general pest! It burns most brightly in the Author's breast, Its soothing hopes his various pains beguile, And give to Learning's face her sweetest smile: What joy, to think his Genius may create Existence far beyond the common date! His Wealth of Mind to latest ages give, And in Futurity's affection live! From unborn beauty, still to Fancy dear, Draw with soft magic the delightful tear; Or thro' the bosom of far distant Youth Spread the warm glow of Liberty and Truth! O Gibbon! by thy frank ambition taught, Let me like thee maintain th' enlivening thought, That, from Oblivion's killing cloud secure, My Hope may prosper and my Verse endure: While thy bright Name, on History's car sublime, Rolls in just triumph o'er the field of Time, May I, unfaltering, thy long march attend, No flattering Slave! but an applauding Friend! Display th' imperfect sketch I fondly drew, Of that wide province, where thy laurels grew; And, honour'd with a wreath of humbler bays, Join the loud Pæan of thy lasting praise!

Verse translations that appeared in these notes have been included as poems. See 18D) VOL. 4 ?Vatibus addere calcar Ut studio majore petant Helicona virentem. Hor. EPISTLE THE FIRST. ARGUMENT OF THE FIRST EPISTLE. Introduction.—Design of the Poem to remove prejudices which obstruct the cultivation of Epic writing.—Origin of Poetry.—Honours paid to its infancy.—Homer the first Poet remaining.—Difficulty of the question why he had no Successor in Greece.— Remark of a celebrated Writer, that as Criticism flourishes Poetry declines.—Defence of Critics.— Danger of a bigoted acquiescence in critical Systems —and of a Poet's criticising his own works.— Advantages of Friendship and Study of the higher Poets. Perish that critic pride, which oft has hurl'd Its empty thunders o'er the Epic world; Which, eager to extend its mimic reign, Would bind free Fancy in a servile chain; With papal rage the eye of Genius blind, And bar the gates of Glory on the mind! Such dark decrees have letter'd Bigots penn'd, Yet seiz'd that honour'd name, the Poet's Friend. But Learning from her page their laws will blot; Scorn'd be their arrogance! their name forgot! Th' indignant Bard, abhorring base controul, Seeks the just Critic of congenial soul. Say! Mason, Judge and Master of the Lyre! Harmonious Chief of Britain's living Choir, Say! wilt Thou listen to his weaker strains, Who pants to range round Fancy's rich domains; To vindicate her empire, and disown Proud System, seated on her injur'd throne? Come! while thy Muse, contented with applause, Gives to her graceful song a little pause, Enjoying triumphs past; at leisure laid In thy sweet Garden's variegated shade, Or fondly hanging on some favourite Oak That Harp, whose notes the fate of Mona spoke, Strung by the sacred Druids' social band, And wisely trusted to thy kindred hand! Come! for thy liberal and ingenuous heart Can aid a Brother in this magic art; Let us, and Freedom be our guide, explore The highest province of poetic lore, Free the young Bard from that oppressive awe, Which feels Opinion's rule as Reason's law, And from his spirit bid vain fears depart, Of weaken'd Nature and exhausted Art! Phantoms! that literary spleen conceives! Dullness adopts, and Indolence believes! While with advent'rous step we wind along Th' expansive regions of Heroic song, From different sources let our search explain Why few the Chieftans of this wide domain. Haply, inspiriting poetic youth, Our verse may prove this animating truth, That Poesy's sublime, neglected field May still new laurels to Ambition yield; Her Epic trumpet, in a modern hand, Still make the spirit glow, the heart expand. Be such our doctrine! our enlivening aim The Muse's honour, and our Country's fame! Thou first and fairest of the social Arts! Sovereign of liberal souls and feeling hearts! If, in devotion to thy heavenly charms, I clasp'd thy altar with my infant arms, For thee neglected the wide field of wealth, The toils of int'rest and the sports of health,— Enchanting Poesy! that zeal repay With powers to sing thy universal sway! To trace thy progress from thy distant birth, Heaven's pure descendant! dear delight of Earth! Charm of all regions! to no age confin'd! The prime ennobler of th' aspiring mind! Nor will thy dignity, sweet Power! disdain What Fiction utters in her idle strain, Thy sportive Friend! who mocking solemn Truth, Tells her fond tales of thy untutor'd youth. As wrong'd Latona (so her tale begins) To Delphos travell'd with her youthful twins; Th' envenom'd Python, with terrific sway, Cross'd the fair Goddess in her destin'd way: The heavenly parent, in the wild alarm, Her little Dian in her anxious arm, High on a stone, which she in terror trod, Cried to her filial guard, the Archer God, Bidding with force, that spoke the Mother's heart, Her young Apollo launch his ready dart; In measur'd sounds her rapid mandate flow'd, The first foundation of the future Ode! Thus, at their banquets, fabling Greeks rehearse The fancied origin of sacred Verse: And though cold Reason may with scorn assail, Or turn contemptuous from their simple tale, Yet, Poesy! thy sister Art may stoop From this weak sketch to paint th' impassion'd group. Though taste refin'd to modern Verse deny The hacknied pageants of the Pagan sky, Their sinking radiance still the Canvass warms, Painting still glories in their graceful forms; Nor canst thou envy, if the world agree To grant thy Sister claims denied to thee; For thee, the happier Art! the elder-born! Superior rights and dearer charms adorn: Confin'd she catches, with observance keen, Her single moment of the changeful scene; But thou, endu'd with energy sublime, Unquestion'd arbiter of space and time! Canst join the distant, the unknown create, And, while Existence yields thee all her state, On the astonish'd mind profusely pour Myriads of forms, that Fancy must adore. Yet of thy boundless power the dearest part Is firm possession of the feeling Heart: No progeny of Chance, by Labour taught, No slow-form'd creature of scholastic thought, The child of Passion thou! thy lyre she strung, To her parental notes she tun'd thy tongue; Gave thee her boldest swell, her softest tone, And made the compass of her voice thy own. To Admiration, source of joy refin'd! Chaste, lovely mover of the simple mind! To her, though sceptics, in their pride, declaim, With many an insult, on her injur'd name; To her, sweet Poesy! we owe thy birth, Thou first encomiast of the fruitful Earth! By her inspir'd, the earliest mortal found The ear-delighting charm of measur'd sound; He hail'd the Maker of a world so fair, And the first accent of his song was prayer. O, most attractive of those airy Powers, Who most illuminate Man's chequer'd hours! Is there an Art, in all the group divine, Whose dawn of Being must not yield to thine? Religion's self, whose provident controul Takes from fierce Man his anarchy of soul, She o'er thy youth with fond affection hung, And borrow'd music from thy infant tongue. Law, sterner Law, whose potent voice imprest Severest terror on the human breast, With thy fresh flow'rs her aweful figure crown'd, And spoke her mandate in thy softer sound. E'en cold Philosophy, whom later days Saw thy mean rival, envious of thy praise; Who clos'd against thee her ungrateful arms, And urg'd her Plato to defame thy charms; She from thy childhood gain'd no fruitless aid, From thee she learnt her talent to persuade. Gay Nature view'd thee with a smiling glance, The Graces round thee fram'd the frolic dance: And well might festive Joy thy favour court; Thy song turn'd strife to peace and toil to sport. Exhausted Vigour at thy voice reviv'd, And Mirth from thee her dearest charm deriv'd. Triumphant Love, in thy alliance blest, Enlarg'd his empire o'er the gentle breast; His torch assum'd new lustre from thy breath, And his clear flame defied the clouds of death, But of the splendid train, who felt thy sway, Or drew existence from thy vital ray, Glory, with fondest zeal, proclaim'd thy might, And hail'd thee victor of oblivious Night. Her martial trumpet to thy hand she gave, At once to quicken and reward the Brave: It sounds—his blood the kindling Hero pays, A cheap and ready price for thy eternal praise! Tho' selfish Fear th' immortal strain deride, And mock the Warrior's wish as frantic pride! Ye gallant, hapless Dead of distant time, Whose fame has perish'd unembalm'd in rhyme, As thro' the desert air your ashes fly, In Fancy's ear the nameless atoms cry, “To us, unhappy! cruel Fates refuse “The well-earn'd record of th' applauding Muse.” Blest are those Chiefs, who, blazon'd on her roll, Still waken virtue in each kindred soul; Their bright existence still on earth prolong, And shine for ever in the deathless song. Yet oft Oblivion, in a treacherous shade, Has sunk the tuneful rites to Valour paid; Her palsied lips refusing to rehearse The sacred, old, traditionary verse. As well the curious eye, with keen desire, Might hope to catch that spark of vital fire, Which first thro' Chaos shot a sudden light, And quicken'd Nature in its transient flight; As the fond ear to catch the fleeting note, Which on the ravish'd air was heard to float, When first the Muse her Epic strain began, And every list'ning Chief grew more than Man. But, as the Ruler of the new-born day From Chaos rose, in glory's rich array; So from deep shades, impenetrably strong, That shroud the darken'd world of antient song, Bright Homer bursts, magnificently clear, The solar Lord of that poetic sphere; Before whose blaze, in wide luxuriance spread, Each Grecian Star hides his diminish'd head; Whose beams departed yet enchant the sight, In Latium's softer, chaste, reflected light. Say ye! whose curious philosophic eye Searches the depth where Nature's secrets lie; Ye, who can tell how her capricious fit Directs the flow and ebb of human wit, And why, obedient to her quick command, Spring-tides of Genius now enrich her fav'rite land, Now sink, by her to different climes assign'd, And only leave some worthless weeds behind! Say! why in Greece, unrival'd and alone, The Sovereign Poet grac'd his Epic throne? Why did the realm that echoed his renown, Produce no kindred heir to claim his crown? If, as the liberal mind delights to think, Fancy's rich flow'rs their vital essence drink From Liberty's pure streams, that largely roll Their quick'ning virtue thro' the Poet's soul; Why, in the period when this Friend of Earth Made Greece the model of heroic worth, And saw her votaries act, beneath her sway, Scenes more sublime than Fiction can display, Why did the Epic Muse's silent lyre Shrink from those feats that summon'd all her fire? Or if, as courtly Theorists maintain, The Muses revel in a Monarch's reign; Why, when young Ammon's soul, athirst for fame, Call'd every Art to celebrate his name; When ready Painting, at his sovereign nod, With aweful thunder arm'd this mimic God; Why did coy Poesy, tho' fondly woo'd, Refuse that dearer smile for which he sued, And see him shed, in martial Honour's bloom, The tear of envy on Achilles' tomb? In vain would Reason those nice questions solve, Which the fine play of mental powers involve: In Bards of ancient time, with genius fraught, What mind can trace how thought engender'd thought, How little hints awak'd the large design, And subtle Fancy spun her variegated line? Yet sober Critics, of no vulgar note, But such as Learning's sons are proud to quote, The progress of Homeric verse explain, As if their souls had lodg'd in Homer's brain. Laughs not the spirit of poetic frame, However slightly warm'd by Fancy's flame, When grave Bossu by System's studied laws The Grecian Bard's ideal picture draws, And wisely tells us, that his Song arose As the good Parson's quiet Sermon grows; Who, while his easy thoughts no pressure find From hosts of images that crowd the mind, First calmly settles on some moral text, Then creeps—from one division—to the next? Nor, if poetic minds more flowly drudge Thro' the cold comments of this Gallic judge, Will their indignant spirit less deride That subtle Pedant's more presumptive pride, Whose bloated page, with arrogance replete, Imputes to Virgil his own dark conceit; And from the tortur'd Poet dares to draw That latent sense, which Horace never saw; Which, if on solid próof more strongly built, Must brand the injur'd Bard with impious guilt. While such Dictators their vain efforts waste In the dark visions of distemper'd Taste, Let us that pleasing, happier light pursue, Which beams benignant from the milder few, Who, justly conscious of the doubts that start In all nice questions on each finer Art, With modest doubt assign each likely cause, But dare to dictate no decisive laws. 'Tis said by one, who, with this candid claim, Has gain'd no fading wreath of Critic fame, Who, fondly list'ning to her various rhyme, Has mark'd the Muse's step thro' many a clime; That, where the settled Rules of Writing spread, Where Learning's code of Critic Law is read, Tho' other treasures deck th' enlighten'd shore, The germs of Fancy ripen there no more. Are Critics then, that bold, imperious tribe! The Guards of Genius, who his path prescribe; Are they like Visirs in an Eastern court, Who sap the very power they should support? Whose specious wiles the royal mind unnerve, And sink the monarch they pretend to serve. No! of their value higher far I deem; And prize their useful toil with fond esteem. When Lowth's firm spirit leads him to explore The hallow'd confines of Hebraic lore; When his free pages, luminous and bold, The glorious end of Poesy unfold, Assert her powers, her dignity defend, And speak her, as she is, fair Freedom's friend; When thus he shines his mitred Peers above, I view his warmth with reverential love; Proud, if my verse may catch reflected light From the rich splendor of a mind so bright. Blest be the names, to no vain system tied, Who render Learning's blaze an useful guide, A friendly beacon, rais'd on high to teach The wand'ring bark to shun the shallow beach. But O! ye noble, and aspiring few, Whose ardent souls poetic fame pursue, Ye, on whom smiling Heaven, perfection's source, Seems to bestow unlimitable force, The inborn vigour of your souls defend, Nor lean too fondly on the firmest friend! Genius may sink on Criticism's breast, By weak dependance on her truth opprest, Sleep on her lap, and stretch his lifeless length, Shorn by her soothing hand of all his strength. Thou wilt not, Mason! thou, whose generous heart Must feel that Freedom is the soul of Art, Thou wilt not hold me arrogant or vain, If I advise the young poetic train To deem infallible no Critic's word; Not e'en the dictates of thy Attic Hurd: No! not the Stagyrite's unquestion'd page, The Sire of Critics, sanctified by age! The noblest minds, with solid reason blest, Who feel that faculty above the rest, Who argue on those arts they never try, Exalt that Reason they so oft apply, Till in its pride, with tyrannous controul, It crush the kindred talents of the soul; And hence, in every Art, will systems rise, Which Fancy must survey with angry eyes; And at the lightning of her scornful smile, In frequent ruin sinks the labour'd pile. How oft, my Romney! have I known thy vein Swell with indignant heat and gen'rous pain, To hear, in terms both arrogant and tame, Some reas'ning Pedant on thy Art declaim: Its laws and limits when his sovereign taste With firm precision has minutely trac'd, And in the close of a decisive speech Pronounc'd some point beyond the Pencil's reach, How has thy Genius, by one rapid stroke, Refuted all the sapient things he spoke! Thy Canvass placing, in the clearest light, His own Impossible before his sight! O might the Bard who loves thy mental fire, Who to thy fame attun'd his early lyre, Learn from thy Genius, when dull Fops decide, So to refute their systematic pride! Let him, at least, succeeding Poets warn To view the Pedant's lore with doubt, or scorn, And e'en to question, with a spirit free, Establish'd Critics of the first degree! Among the names that Judgment loves to praise, The pride of ancient, or of modern days; What Laws of Poesy can Learning show Above the Critic song of sage Despreaux? His fancy elegant, his judgment nice, His method easy, and his style concise; The Bard of Reason, with her vigour fraught, Her purest doctrine he divinely taught; Nor taught in vain! His precept clear and chaste Reform'd the errors of corrupted Taste; And French Imagination, who was bit By that Tarantula, distorted Wit, Ceasing her antic gambols to rehearse, Blest the pure magic of his healing verse: With his loud fame applauding Europe rung, And his just praise a rival Poet sung. Yet, had this Friend of Verse-devoted Youth, This tuneful Teacher of Poetic truth, Had he but chanc'd his doctrine to diffuse Ere Milton commun'd with his sacred Muse; And could that English, self-dependant soul, Born with such energy as mocks controul, Could his high spirit, with submissive awe, Have stoop'd to listen to a Gallic Law; His hallow'd subject, by that Law forbid, Might still have laid in silent darkness hid, And, this bright Sun not rising in our sphere, Homer had wanted still his true compeer. From hence let Genius to himself be just, Hence learn, ye Bards, a liberal distrust; Whene'er 'tis said, by System's haughty Son, That what He cannot do, can ne'er be done, 'Tis Fancy's right th' exalted throne to press, Whose height proud System can but blindly guess, Springs, whose existence she denies, unlock, And call rich torrents from the flinty rock. Let the true Poet, who would build a name In noble rivalship of ancient fame, When he would plan, to triumph over Time, The splendid sabric of his losty rhyme, Let him the pride of Constantine assume, Th' imperial Founder of the second Rome, Who scorn'd all limits to his work assign'd, Save by th' inspiring God who rul'd his mind; Or, like the fabled Jupiter, ut perhibent, spatium quum discere vellet Naturæ, regni nescius ipse sui, Armigeros utrimque duos æqualibus alis Misit ab Eois Occiduisque plagis. Parnassus geminos fertur junxisse volatus; Contulit alternas Pythius axis aves. Claudian. Jove, to ascertain The doubtful confines of his wide domain, Two Eagles let him send of equal wing, Whose different flight may form a perfect ring, And, at the point where Sense and Fancy meet, There safely bold, and though sublime discreet, His fame's foundation let him firmly lay, Nor dread the danger of disputed sway! Yet, if the Bard to glory must aspire By free exertion of unborrow'd fire, Nor, like the Classic Bigot, vainly deem No modern Muse can challenge just esteem, Unless her robe in every fold be prest To fall precisely like the Grecian vest; If the blind notion he must boldly shun, That Beauty's countless forms are only one, And not, when Fancy, from her magic hoard, Would blindly bring him treasures unexplor'd, Snap her light wand, and force her hand to bear The heavier Compass, and the formal Square; Let him no less their dangerous pride decline, Who singly criticise their own design. In that nice toil what various perils lurk! Not Pride alone may mar the needful work; But foes more common to the feeling nerve, Where Taste and Genius dwell with coy Reserve, The sickly Doubt, with modest weakness fraught, The languid Tedium of o'erlabour'd thought, The Pain to feel the growing work behind The finish'd model in the forming mind; These foes, that oft the Poet's bosom pierce, These! that condemn'd to fire Virgilian Verse, Prove that the Bard, a bold, yet trembling elf, Should find a Critic firmer than himself. But what fine Spirit will assume the Judge, Patient thro' all this irksome toil to drudge? 'Tis here, O Friendship! here thy glories shine; The hard, th' important task is only thine; For thou alone canst all the powers unite, That justly make it thy peculiar right: Thine the fixt eye, which at no foible winks; Thine the warm zeal, which utters all it thinks, In those sweet tones, that hasty Spleen disarm, That give to painful Truth a winning charm, And the quick hand of list'ning Genius teach, To grasp that excellence he burns to reach: Thou sweet Subduer of all mental strife! Thou Source of vigour! thou Support of life! Nor Art nor Science could delight or live, Without that energy thy counsels give: Genius himself must sink in dumb despair, Unblest, uncherish'd by thy cheering care. Nor let the Bard, elate with youthful fire, When Fancy to his hand presents the lyre, When her strong plumes his soaring spirit lift, When Friendship, Heaven's more high and holy gift, With zeal angelic prompts his daring flight, And round him darts her doubt-dispelling light; Let him not then, by Vanity betray'd, Look with unjust contempt on Learning's aid! But, as th' advent'rous Seaman, to attain That bright renown which great Discoverers gain, Consults the conduct of each gallant name, Who sail'd before him in that chase of Fame, Reviews, with frequent glance, their useful chart, Marks all their aims, and fathoms all their art, So let the Poet trace their happy course, So bravely emulate their mental force, Whose daring souls, from many a different clime, Have nobly ventur'd on the sea of Rhyme! Led by no fear, his swelling sail to slack, Let him, with eager eyes, pursue the track; Not like a Pirate, with insidious views To plunder every vessel he pursues, But with just hope to find yet farther shores, And pass each rival he almost adores! END OF THE FIRST EPISTLE. EPISTLE THE SECOND. ARGUMENT OF THE SECOND EPISTLE. Character of Ancient Poets—Homer—Apollonius Rho- dius—Virgil—Lucan. Hail, mighty Father of the Epic line, Thou vast, prolific, intellectual Mine, Whence veins of ancient and of modern gold, The wealth of each poetic world, have roll'd! Great Bard of Greece, whose ever-during Verse All ages venerate, all tongues rehearse; Could blind idolatry be justly paid To aught of mental power by man display'd, To thee, thou Sire of soul-exalting Song, That boundless worship might to thee belong; For, as thy Jove, on his Olympian throne, In his unrivall'd sway exults alone, Commanding Nature by his awful nod, In high seclusion from each humbler God; So shines thy Genius thro' the cloud of years, Exalted far above thy Pagan peers By the rich splendor of creative fire, And the deep thunder of thy martial lyre; The conscious world confesses thy controul, And hails thee Sovereign of the kindling soul. Yet, could thy mortal shape revisit earth, How would it move, great Bard! thy scornful mirth, To hear vain Pedants to thy Verse assign Scholastic thoughts that never could be thine; To hear the quaint conceits of modern Pride Blaspheme thy Fancy and thy Taste deride? When thus in Vanity's capricious fit, We see thy fame traduc'd by Gallic wit, We see a Dwarf, who dares his foot to rest On a recumbent Giant's ample chest, And, lifting his pert form to public sight, Boasts, like a child, his own superior height. But neither envious Wit's malignant craft, Tho' arm'd with Ridicule's envenom'd shaft, Nor fickle Fashion's more tyrannic sway, Whose varying voice the sons of Earth obey, Can shake the solid base of thy renown, Or blast the verdure of thy Laurel crown. Tho' Time, who from his many-colour'd wings, Scatters ten thousand shades o'er human things, Has wrought unnumber'd changes since thy birth, And given new features to the face of earth; Tho' all thy Gods who shook the starry pole, Unquestion'd Rulers of the Pagan soul, Are fallen with their fanes, in ruin hurl'd, Their worship vanish'd from th' enlighten'd world; Still its immortal force thy Song retains, Still rules obedient man and fires his glowing veins; For Nature's self, that great and constant power, One and the same thro' every changing hour, Gave thee each secret of her reign to pierce, And stampt her signet on thy sacred Verse; That awful signet, whose imperial sway No age disputes, no regions disobey; For at its sight the subject passions start, And open all the passes of the heart. 'Twas Nature taught thy Genius to display That host of Characters who grace thy lay; So richly varied and so vast the store, Her plastic hand can hardly model more: 'Twas Nature, noblest of poetic Guides, Gave thee thy flowing Verse, whose copious tides Gushing luxuriant from high Fancy's source, By no vain art diverted in their course, With splendid ease, with simple grandeur roll, Spread their free wealth, and fertilize the soul. There are, whom blind and erring zeal betrays To wound thy Genius with ill-judging praise; Who rashly deem thee of all Arts the sire, Who draw dull smoke from thy resplendent fire, Pretend thy fancied Miracles to pierce, And form quaint riddles of thy clearest Verse; Blind to those brighter charms and purer worth, Which make thy Lays the lasting joy of earth. For why has every age with fond acclaim Swell'd the loud note of thy increasing fame? Not that cold Study may from thee deduce Vain codes of mystic lore and laws abstruse; But that thy Song presents, like solar light, A world in action to th' enraptur'd sight; That, with a force beyond th' enervate rules Of tame Philosophy's pedantic Schools, Thy living Images instruct mankind, Mould the just heart, and fire th' heroic mind. E'en Socrates himself, that purest Sage, Imbib'd his Wisdom from thy moral page; And haply Greece, the Wonder of the Earth For feats of martial fire and civic worth, That glorious Land, of noblest minds the nurse, Owes her unrivall'd race to thy inspiring Verse; For O, what Greek, who in his youthful vein Had felt thy soul-invigorating strain, Who that had caught, amid the festive throng, The public lesson of thy patriot Song, Could ever cease to feel his bosom swell With zeal to dare, and passion to excel. In thee thy grateful country justly prais'd The noblest Teacher of the tribes she rais'd; Thy voice, which doubly gave her fame to last, Form'd future Heroes, while it sung the past. What deep regret thy fond admirers feel, That mythologic clouds thy life conceal; That, like a distant God, thou'rt darkly shown, Felt in thy Works, but in Thyself unknown! Perchance the shades that hide thy mortal days From keen Affection's disappointed gaze, And that Idolatry, so fondly proud, With which thy Country to thy genius bow'd, Might form the cause why, kindling with thy fire, No Grecian rival struck thy Epic lyre; Perchance, not seeing how thy steps were train'd, How they the summit of Parnassus gain'd, On thy oppressive Glory's flaming pride Young Emulation gaz'd, and gazing died. The Muses of the Attic Stage impart To many a Votary their kindred art; And she who bids the Theban Eagle bear Her lyric thunder thro' the stormy air, How high soe'er she leads his daring flight, Guides his bold rivals to an equal height. Of all the Grecian Bards in Glory's race, 'Tis thine alone, by thy unequall'd pace, To reach the goal with loud applause, and hear No step approaching thine, no rival near. Yet may not Judgment, with severe disdain, Slight the young Rhodian's variegated strain; Tho' with less force he strike an humbler shell, Beneath his hand the notes of Passion swell. His tender Genius, with alluring art, Displays the tumult of the Virgin's heart, When Love, like quivering rays that never rest, Darts thro' each vein, and vibrates in her breast. Tho' Nature feel his Verse, tho' she declare Medea's magic is still potent there, Yet Fancy sees the slighted Poet rove In pensive anger thro' th' Elysian Grove. From Critic shades, whose supercilious pride His Song neglected, or his Powers decried, He turns indignant—unopprest by fears, Behold, he seeks the sentence of his Peers. See their just band his honest claim allow! See pleasure lighten on his laurell'd brow! He soars the Critic's cold contempt above, For Virgil greets him with fraternal love! Hail, thou rich Column, on whose high-wrought frame The Roman Muse supports her Epic fame! Hail, great Magician, whose illusive charms Gave pleasing lustre to a Tyrant's arms, To Jove's pure sceptre turn'd his iron rod, And made the Homicide a Guardian God! Hail, wond'rous Bard, to Glory's temple led Thro' paths that Genius rarely deigns to tread; For Imitation, she whose syren song Betrays the skilful and unnerves the strong, Preserving thee on her perfidious shore, Where many a Poet had been wreck'd before, Led thee to heights that charm th' astonish'd eye, And with Invention's heaven in splendor vie. As Rome herself, by long unwearied toil, Glean'd the fair produce of each foreign soil; From all her wide Dominion's various parts Borrow'd their laws, their usages, their arts; Imported knowledge from each adverse zone, And made the wisdom of the world her own: Thy patient spirit thus, from every Bard Whose mental riches won thy just regard, Drew various treasure; which thy skill refin'd, And in the fabric of thy Verse combin'd. It was thy glory, as thy fond desire, To echo the sweet notes of Homer's lyre; But with an art thy hand alone can reach, An art that has endear'd the strain of each. So the young Nymph, whose tender arms embrace An elder Sister of enchanting grace, Though form'd herself with every power to please, By genuine character and native ease, Yet fondly copies from her favourite Fair He mien, her motion, her attractive air, Her robe's nice shape, her riband's pleasing hue, And every ornament that strikes the view; But she displays, by imitative art, So quick a spirit, and so soft a heart, The graceful mimic while our eyes adore, We think the model cannot charm us more: Tho' seen together, each more lovely shows, And by comparison their beauty grows. Some Critics, to decide which Bard prevails, Weigh them like Jove, but not in golden scales; In their false balance th' injur'd Greek they raise, Virgil sinks loaded with their heavy praise. Ingenuous Bard, whose mental rays divine Shaded by modest doubts more sweetly shine; Thou whose last breath, unconscious of the wrong, Doom'd to destruction thy sublimest Song; How dull their incense in thy sight must burn, How must thy spirit with abhorrence turn From their disgusting rites, who at thy shrine Blaspheme thy Master's name, to honour thine! More equal tribute, in their simpler flowers, The Poets offer to your separate powers; For all poetic eyes delight to view Your different forms, and with devotion due In each the radiant Delphic God they own, By beauteus majesty distinctly shown: But they behold the lofty Homer stand The bright Colossus of the Rhodian land, Beneath whose feet the waves submissive roll, Whose towering head appears to prop the pole; Stupendous Image! grand in every part, And seeming far above the reach of mortal art. In thee, thou lovely Mantuan Bard, appear The softer features of the Belvidere; That finish'd grace which fascinates all eyes, Yet from the copying hand elusive flies: Charms so complete, by such pure spirit warm'd, They make less perfect beauty seem deform'd. O had thy Muse, whose decorating skill Could spread rich foliage o'er the leafless hill; Had she, who knew with nicest hand to frame The sweet unperishable wreaths of fame; Had she, exalted by a happier fate, Virtue's free Herald, and no Slave of State, Deck'd worthier shrines with her unfading flower, And given to Freedom what she gave to Power; Then with more keen delight and warmer praise The world had listen'd to thy bolder lays; Perchance had ow'd to thee (a mighty debt) Verse where Perfection her bright seal had set, Where Art could nothing blame and Nature nought regret. Of coarser form, with less pathetic charms, Hating with Stoic pride a tyrant's arms, In the keen fervour of that florid time When youthful Fancy pours her hasty rhyme, When all the mind's luxuriant shoots appear, Untrimm'd by Art, by Interest, or Fear, See daring Lucan for that wreath contend, Which Freedom twines for her poetic friend. 'Tis thine, thou bold but injur'd Bard, 'tis thine! Tho' Critic spleen insult thy rougher line; Tho' wrong'd thy Genius, and thy Name misplac'd By vain distinctions of fastidious Taste; Indignant Freedom, with just anger fir'd, Shall guard the Poet whom herself inspir'd. What tho' thy early, uncorrected page Betrays some marks of a degenerate age; Tho' many a tumid point thy verse contains, Like warts projecting from Herculean veins; Tho' like thy Cato thy stern Muse appear, Her manners rigid, and her frown austere; Like him, still breathing Freedom's genuine flame, Justice her idol, Public Good her aim, Well she supplies her want of softer art By all the sterling treasures of the heart; By Energy, from Independance caught, And the free Vigour of unborrow'd Thought. Thou Bard most injur'd by malicious fate, Could not thy Blood appease a tyrant's hate? Must He, still gall'd by thy poetic claim, With falshood persecute thy moral fame? Shall History's pen, to aid his vengeance won, Brand thee, brave Spirit! as an impious Son, Who meanly fear'd to yield his vital flood, And sought his safety by a Parent's blood? Base calumny, at which Belief must halt, And blind Credulity herself revolt. Could that firm Youth become so vile a slave, Whose voice new energy to virtue gave; Whose Stoic soul all abject thoughts abhorr'd, And own'd no sordid passion as its lord; Who in the trying hour of mortal pain, While life was ebbing from his open vein, Alike unconscious of Remorse and Fear, His heart unshaken, and his senses clear, Smil'd on his doom, and, like the fabled bird Whose music on Meander's bank was heard, Form'd into tuneful notes his parting breath, And sung th' approaches of undreaded death? Rise, thou wrong'd Bard! above Detraction's reach, Whose arts in vain thy various worth impeach; Enjoy that fame thy spirit knew to prize, And view'd so fondly with prophetic eyes. Tho' the nice Critics of fastidious France Survey thy Song with many a scornful glance, And as a Goth the kinder judge accuse, Who with their great Corneille commends thy Muse, Let Britain, eager as the Lesbian State To shield thy Pompey from the wrongs of Fate, To thee with pride a fond attachment show, Thou Bard of Freedom! tho' the world's thy foe. As keenly sensible of Beauty's sway, Let our just isle such generous honour pay To the fair partner of thy hapless life, As Lesbos paid to Pompey's lovely Wife. Ye feeling Painters, who with genius warm Delineate Virtue in her softest form, Let Argentaria on your canvass shine, A graceful mourner at her Poet's shrine; For, nobly fearless of the Tyrant's hate, She mourns her murder'd Bard in solemn state; With pious care she decks his splendid tomb, Where the dark Cypress sheds its soothing gloom, There frequent takes her solitary stand, His dear Pharsalia in her faithful hand; That hand, whose toil the Muses still rehearse, Which fondly copied his unfinish'd Verse. See, as she bends before his recent urn, See tender Grief to Adoration turn! O lovely Mourner! could my Song bestow Unfading glory on thy generous woe, Age after age thy virtue should record, And thou should'st live immortal as thy Lord. Him Liberty shall crown with endless praise, True to her cause in Rome's degenerate days; Him, like his Brutus, her fond eye regards, And hails him as the last of Roman Bards. END OF THE SECOND EPISTLE. EPISTLE THE THIRD. ARGUMENT OF THE THIRD EPISTLE. Sketch of the Northern and the Provençal Poetry.— The most distinguished Epic Poets of Italy, Spain, Portugal, France, and England. Blest be the hand that with a generous care, To the bright Crown which Learning loves to wear, Restores the Gem, whose lustre, faint and pale, Died in the fold of dark Oblivion's veil. Such praise, O Mason! to the Bard is due, In whose fraternal guard thy Genius grew; O'er whose untimely grave thy Lyre has paid Its just devotion to a Brother's shade: And thus hereafter shall the British Muse, In Memory's fane the fairest tablet chuse, To bid her sons your blended names admire, The pride of Friendship's as of Fancy's choir. Thy modest Gray, solicitous to pierce The dark and distant source of modern Verse, By strings untried first taught his English Lyre To reach the Gothic Harp's terrific fire: The North's wild spectres own his potent hand, And Hell's nine portals at his voice expand; With new existence by his Verse endued, See Gothic Fable wakes her shadowy brood, Which, in the Runic rhymes of many a Scald. With pleasing dread our Northern sires appall'd. Ye brave Progenitors, ye vigorous Source Of modern Freedom and of Europe's force, While your rude minds, athirst for martial strife, Mock'd all the meaner arts of polish'd life, The Muse still led you by her magic clue, And from your savage strength new vigor drew. In War's dire field your dauntless Bards appear'd, Aloft their animating harps they rear'd, Pour'd through the charging host their potent strain, And swell'd the fiery flood in Valor's vein. Souls thus inspir'd, in every scene elate, Defied the utmost rage of adverse fate; In tort'ring death the Royal Captive sang, And smiles of triumph hid his mortal pang. Thus to brave Odin's Songs, our Northern sire, Rude, early framer of the modern Lyre, Fierce Freedom gave an energy sublime, Parent and Guardian of the Gothic Rhyme. While nurtur'd in the North's protecting arms, The modern Muse display'd her infant charms, Like Jove's undaunted Child her spirit glow'd, And force Herculean in her cradle shew'd; Her native scene in roughness she surpast, Her breath tempestuous as the Northern blast: But, when to softer climes the vagrant flew, And bask'd beneath a sky of azure hue; When for her throne the flowery South she chose, And form'd her crown of the Provençal Rose; Warm'd by a brighter Sun's relaxing beams, She tun'd her alter'd voice to tender themes: Here her gay form a gaudier dress assumes, And shines in Chivalry's imperial plumes; Her votaries wear proud Honor's mystic glove, And every lyre resounds Romantic Love; Save when, to burst Oppression's mental chain, Keen Satire mingles with this gallant train, Strikes Priestly pride with Wit's vindictive flash, And galls the ghostly Tyrant with her lash. Afraid of Poesy's expansive flood, These early Bards along the shallows scud In some light skiff; for on the depths untried No full-trimm'd vessel floats in Epic pride. As infants, eager for regard, abound In sportive efforts of uncertain sound, Before their little artless lips can reach The harder elements of perfect speech; So the young language of each modern clime Rose by prelusive lays to lofty rhyme. Thro' many an age, while, in the Convent bred, O'er the chill'd mind scholastic darkness spread, Those keener Spirits, who from Nature caught The warmth that kindles to Poetic thought, Betray'd, Ambition! by thy blind desire, Struck with ill-fated zeal the Latian lyre, Tho' Discord's hand the jarring strings had crost, And all the sweetness of their tone was lost. At length, fair Italy, luxuriant land, Where Art's rich flowers in earliest bloom expand, Thy daring Dante his wild Vision sung, And rais'd to Epic pomp his native Tongue. Down Arno's stream his new-form'd music floats, The proud vale echoing with his Tuscan notes. See the bold Bard now sink and now ascend, Wherever Thought can pierce or Life extend; In his wide circuit from Hell's drear abyss, Thro' purifying scenes to realms of perfect bliss, He seems begirt with all that airy throng, Who brighten or debase the Poet's song. Sublimest Fancy now directs his march To opening worlds, through that infernal arch O'er whose rough summit aweful words are read, That freeze each entering soul with hopeless dread. Now at her bidding his strong numbers flow, And rend the heart at Ugolino's woe; While Nature's glory-giving tear bedews A tale unrivall'd by the Grecian Muse. Now to those notes that milder grief inspire, Pathetic Tenderness attunes his lyre, Which, soft as murmurs of the plaintive dove, Tells the sad issue of illicit love. But all the worse companions of his way Soon into different sounds his ductile voice betray: Satiric Fury now appears his guide, Thro' thorny Paths of Enmity and Pride; Now quaint Conceit his wand'ring steps misleads Thro' all the hideous forms that Folly breeds; Now Priestly Dullness the lost Bard enshrouds In cold confusion and scholastic clouds. Unequal Spirit! in thy various strain, With all their influence Light and Darkness reign; In thy strange Verse and wayward Theme alike New forms of Beauty and Disorder strike; Extremes of Harmony and Discord dwell, The Seraph's music and the Demon's yell! The patient Reader, to thy merit just, With transport glows, and shudders with disgust. Thy Failings sprung from thy disastrous time; Thy stronger Beauties from a soul sublime, Whose vigor burst, like the volcano's flame, From central darkness to the sphere of fame. Of gentler mind, and with a heart to feel The fondest warmth of emulative zeal, Thy festive Scholar, who ador'd thy Lays, And grac'd thy Genius with no scanty praise, The gay Boccacio, tempts th' Italian Muse More varied notes and different themes to chuse; Themes which her voice had dar'd not yet to sound, Valor's heroic feats by Beauty crown'd. Sweet was the glowing Song; but, strange to tell, On his bold lyre Oblivion's shadows fell; His richer Tales engross'd the World's regard, And the bright Novelist eclips'd the Bard. In following ages, when Italia's shore Blaz'd with the rising light of Classic lore, Stern System led, from her new-founded school, A Poet fashion'd by her rigid rule: Behold my Son! (his sapient Tut'ress cried) Who throws the bonds of Gothic rhyme aside; For whom these hands the Grecian Lyre new strung: She spoke exulting, and Trissino sung. In his cold Verse he kept her Critic laws, While Pedants own'd their pow'r, and yawn'd applause. Indignant Fancy, who with scorn survey'd The sleepy honors to proud System paid, Smiling to see that on her rival's brow The Poppy lurk'd beneath the Laurel bough, Resolv'd in sportive triumph to display The rich extent of her superior sway: From Necromancy's hand, in happiest hour, She caught the rod of visionary power; And as aloft the magic wand she rais'd, A peerless Bard with new effulgence blaz'd, Born every law of System to disown, And rule by Fancy's boundless power alone. High in mid air, between the Moon and Earth, The Bard of Pathos now, and now of Mirth, Pois'd with his lyre between a Griffin's wings, Her sportive darling, Ariosto, sings. As the light cloud, whose varying vapors fly, Driven by the zephyr of the evening sky, Fixes and charms the never-wearied view, By taking every shape and every hue; So, by Variety's supreme controul, His changeful numbers seize the willing soul. Enchanted by his Song, Attention sits, With features catching every cast by fits, Like the fond infant, in whose tender brain Young Sensibility delights to reign; While rapid Joy and Pain each other chase Thro' the soft muscles of its April face. In vain the slaves of System would discard From Glory's classic train this airy Bard; Delighted Nature her gay fav'rite crown'd, And Envy's clamour in her plaudit drown'd. Severe Morality, to censure mov'd, His wanton Lyre with juster blame reprov'd; But his sweet Song her anger so beguil'd, That, ere she finish'd her reproof, she smil'd. Of chaster fire, a rival name succeeds, Whose bold and glowing hand Religion leads: In solemn accent, and in sacred state, With classic lore and Christian zeal elate, Sweetly pathetic, and sublimely strong, Tasso begins his more majestic song; The Muse of Sion, not implor'd in vain, Guides to th' impassion'd soul his heavenly strain. Blush, Boileau, blush, and for that pride atone, Which slander'd Genius far above thy own; And thou, great injur'd Bard, thy station claim Amid the Demi-gods of Epic name; Heir to a mantle by the Muses spun, Of a Poetic Sire the more poetic Son. Nor, tho' just Fame her richer palm devote To the high sounding lyre of serious note, Shall gay Tassoni want his festive crown, Who banish'd from the Muse her aweful frown, And tuning to light themes her lofty style, O'er her grave features spread a comic smile. Such various Sons, of Epic fire possest, Italia foster'd on her feeling breast. Spain whose bold genius with misjudging pride O'ersteps true glory by too large a stride, Claims higher merit from one Poet's birth, Who rivals all the different Bards of earth: With more than Niobe's parental boast, She calls her single Son himself an Host, And rashly judges that her Vega's lyre Is equal to the whole Aonian quire. Impetuous Poet! whose full brain supplied Such floods of Verse, and in so quick a tide, Their rapid swell, by its unrivall'd height, Pleas'd, yet produc'd more wonder than delight: Tho' thy free rhyme from Fancy's fountain gush, And with the grandeur of the torrent rush, Its troubled streams in dark disorder roam, With all the torrent's noise and all its foam. To Emulation fir'd by Tasso's strain, Thy spirit quitted the dramatic plain To seek those Epic heights, sublimely calm, Whence he had pluck'd his Idumean palm; But, vainly struggling in a task too hard, Sunk at the feet of that superior Bard. Brave Spaniard! still thy wounded pride console; Time shall not strike thy name from Glory's roll, On which thy generous and fraternal hand Emblaz'd each brother of thy tuneful band; Thy Muse shall share the praise she joy'd to give, And while thy language lasts thy fame shall live. Perchance, tho' strange the paradox may seem, That fame had risen with a brighter beam, Had radiant Fancy less enrich'd thy mind: Her lavish wealth, for wiser use design'd, Ruin'd the Poet by its splendid lure, As India's mines have made his country poor. With warmth more temperate, and in notes more clear, That with Homeric richness fill the ear, The brave Ercilla sounds, with potent breath, His Epic trumpet in the fields of death. In scenes of Savage war when Spain unfurl'd Her bloody banners o'er the western world, With all his Country's virtues in his frame, Without the base alloy that stain'd her name. In Danger's camp this military Bard, Whom Cynthia saw on his nocturnal guard, Recorded, in his bold descriptive lay, The-various fortune of the finish'd day; Seizing the pen while Night's calm hours afford A transient slumber to his satiate sword, With noble justice his warm hand bestows The meed of Honour on his valiant foes. Howe'er precluded, by his generous aim, From high pretensions to inventive fame, His strongly-colour'd scenes of sanguine strife, His softer pictures caught from Indian life, Above the visionary forms of art, Fire the awaken'd mind and melt the heart. Tho' fiercest tribes her galling fetters drag, Proud Spain must strike to Lusitania's flag, Whose ampler folds, in conscious triumph spread, Wave o'er her Naval Poet's laureate head. Ye Nymphs of Tagus, from your golden cell, That caught the echo of his tuneful shell, Rise, and to deck your darling's shrine provide The richest treasures that the deep may hide: From every land let grateful Commerce shower Her tribute to the Bard who sung her power; As those rich gales, from whence his Gama caught A pleasing earnest of the prize he sought, The balmy fragrance of the East dispense, So steals his Song on the delighted sense, Astonishing, with sweets unknown before, Those who ne'er tasted but of classic lore. Immortal Bard! thy name with Gama vies, Thou, like thy Hero, with propitious skies The sail of bold adventure hast unfurl'd, And in the Epic ocean found a world. 'Twas thine to blend the Eagle and the Dove, At once the Bard of Glory and of Love: Thy thankless Country heard thy varying lyre To Petrarch's Softness melt, and swell to Homer's Fire! Boast and lament, ungrateful land, a Name, In life, in death, thy honour and thy shame. Thou nobler realm, whom vanity betrays To load thy letter'd sons with lavish praise; Where Eulogy, with one eternal smile, Heaps her faint roses in a withering pile: A City milk-maid, on the first of May, Who, pertly civil, and absurdly gay, Forms her dull garland in fantastic state, With ill-adjusted flow'rs and borrow'd plate. Canst thou, self-flattering France, with justice vaunt One Epic laurel as thy native plant? How oft a Gallic hand, with childish fire, Has rattled Discord on th' heroic lyre, While their dull aid associate Critics bring, And vainly teach the use of every string! In Morals, as, with many an empty boast, They practise virtue least who preach it most; So, haughty Gallia, in thy Epic school, No great Examples rise, but many a Rule. Yet, tho' unjust to Tasso's nobler lays, Keen Boileau shall not want his proper praise; He, archly waving his satiric rod Thro' the new path which first Tassoni trod, Pursued his sportive march in happy hour, And pluck'd from Satire's thorn a festive flower. His sacerdotal War shall wake delight, And smiles in Gravity herself excite, While Canons live to quarrel or to feast, And gall can tinge the spirit of a Priest. Nor, gentle Gresset, shall thy sprightly rhyme Cease to enchant the list'ning ear of Time; In thee the Graces all their powers instill, To touch the Epic chords with playful skill. The hapless Parrot whom thy lays endear, In piety and woe the Trojan's peer; His heart as tender, and his love more pure, Shall, like Æneas, live of fame secure; While female hands, with many a tender word, Stroke the soft feathers of their fav'rite bird. Yet not in childish sport, or trifling joy, Do Gallic Fair-ones all their hours employ: See lovely Boccage, in ambition strong, Build, with aspiring aim, her Epic Song! By Glory fir'd, her rosy lips rehearse Thy feats, Columbus, in unborrow'd Verse. If this new Muse in War's dire field displays No Grecian splendor, no Homeric blaze, Attractive still, tho' not in pomp array'd, She charms like Zama, in her Verse portray'd; Whose form from dress no gorgeous pride assumes, Clad in a simple zone of azure plumes. England's dear guest! this Muse of Gallia caught From our inspiring Isle her ardent thought; Here first she strove to reach, with vent'rous hope, Milton's chaste grandeur, and the grace of Pope; And sweetly taught, in her mimetic strain, The Songs of Britain to the Banks of Seine. But see! with wounded Pride's indignant glance, The angry Genius of presuming France From ancient shrines their Epic wreaths would tear, To swell the glory of her great Voltaire. O, form'd in Learning's various paths to shine, Encircled from thy birth by all the Nine, On thee, blest Bard, these rivals seem'd to shower Their various attributes and blended power! But, when their lofty leader bade thee frame The rich Heroic song on Henry's fame, Sarcastic Humour, trifling with her lyre, Took from th' inspiring Muse her solemn fire. No more her spirit like the Eagle springs, Or rides the buoyant air with balanc'd wings: Tho' rapid still, to narrow circuits bound, She, like the darting Swallow, skims the ground. Thy Verse displays, beneath an Epic name, Wit's flinty Spark, for Fancy's solar Flame. While yet thy hand the Epic chords embrac'd, With playful spirit, and with frolic haste, Such lively sounds thy rapid fingers drew, And thro' the festive notes so lightly flew, Nature and Fancy join'd their charms to swell, And laughing Humour crown'd thy new Pucelle; But the chaste Muses, startled at the sound, Amid thy sprightly numbers blush'd and frown'd; With decent anger, and becoming pride, Severer Virtue threw the Song aside; While Justice own'd it, with a kinder glance, The wittiest Levity of wanton France. Now, graver Britain, amiably severe, To thee, with native zeal, to thee I steer; My vent'rous bark, its foreign circuit o'er, Exulting springs to thy parental shore. Thou gorgeous Queen, who, on thy silvery coast, Sittest encircled by a filial host, And seest thy sons, the jewels of thy crown, Blaze with each varying ray of rich renown; If with just love I hold their Genius dear, Lament their hardships, and their fame revere, O bid thy Epic Muse, with honour due, Range her departed Champions in my view! See, on a party-colour'd steed of fire, With Humour at his side, his trusty Squire, Gay Chaucer leads—in form a Knight of old, And his strong armour is of steel and gold; But o'er it age a cruel rust has spread, And made the brilliant metals dark as lead. Now gentle Spenser, Fancy's fav'rite Bard, Awakes my wonder and my fond regard; Encircling Fairies bear, in sportive dance, His adamantine shield and magic lance; While Allegory, drest with mystic art, Appears his Guide; but, promising to dart A lambent glory round her list'ning Son, She hides him in the web herself has spun. Ingenuous Cowley, the fond dupe of Wit, Seems like a vapour o'er the field to flit; In David's praise he strikes some Epic notes, But soon down Lethe's stream their dying murmur floats. While Cowley vanish'd in an amorous riddle, Up rose the frolic Bard of Bear and Fiddle: His smile exhilarates the sullen earth, Adorning Satire in the mask of Mirth: Taught by his Song, Fanatics cease their jars, And wise Astrologers renounce the Stars. Unrivall'd Butler! blest with happy skill To heal by comic verse each serious ill, By Wit's strong flashes Reason's light dispense, And laugh a frantic nation into sense! Apart, and on a sacred hill retir'd, Beyond all mortal inspiration fir'd, The mighty Milton sits—an host around Of list'ning Angels guard the holy ground; Amaz'd they see a human form aspire To grasp with daring hand a Seraph's lyre, Inly irradiate with celestial beams, Attempt those high, those soul-subduing themes, (Which humbler Denizens of Heaven decline) And celebrate, with sanctity divine, The starry field from warring Angels won, And God triumphant in his Victor Son. Nor less the wonder, and the sweet delight, His milder scenes and softer notes excite, When at his bidding Eden's blooming grove Breathes the rich sweets of Innocence and Love. With such pure joy as our Forefather knew When Raphael, heavenly guest, first met his view, And our glad Sire, within his blissful bower, Drank the pure converse of th' æthereal Power, Round the blest Bard his raptur'd audience throng, And feel their souls imparadis'd in song. Of humbler mien, but not of mortal race, Ill-fated Dryden, with Imperial grace, Gives to th' obedient lyre his rapid laws; Tones yet unheard, with touch divine, he draws, The melting fall, the rising swell sublime, And all the magic of melodious rhyme. See with proud joy Imagination spread A wreath of honor round his aged head! But two base Spectres, tho' of different hue, The Bard unhappy in his march pursue; Two vile disgraceful Fiends, of race accurst, Conceiv'd by Spleen, by meagre Famine nurst, Malignant Satire, mercenary Praise, Shed their dark spots on his immortal bays. Poor Davenant march'd before, with nobler aim, His keen eye fix'd upon the palm of Fame, But cruel Fortune doom'd him to rehearse A Theme ill-chosen, in ill-chosen Verse. Next came Sir Richard, but in woeful plight, Dryden's Led-horse first threw the luckless Knight. He rose advent'rous still—O who may count How oft he tried a different Steed to mount! Each angry steed his awkward rider flung; Undaunted still he fell, and falling sung. But Æsculapius, who, with grief distrest, Beheld his offspring made a public jest, Soon bade a livelier Son with mirth efface The shame he suffer'd from Sir Richard's case. Swift at the word his sprightly Garth began To make an helmet of a Close-stool Pan; An Urinal he for his trumpet takes, And at each blast he blows see Laughter shakes! Yet peace—new music floats on Æther's wings; Say, is it Harmony herself who sings? No! while enraptur'd Sylphs the Song inspire, 'Tis Pope who sweetly wakes the silver lyre To melting notes, more musically clear Than Ariel whisper'd in Belinda's ear. Too soon he quits them for a sharper tone; See him, tho' form'd to fill the Epic throne, Decline the sceptre of that wide domain, To bear a Lictor's rod in Satire's train; And, shrouded in a mist of moral spleen, Behold him close the visionary scene! END OF THE THIRD EPISTLE. EPISTLE THE FOURTH. ARGUMENT OF THE FOURTH EPISTLE. Remarks on the supposed Parsimony of Nature in bestowing Poetic Genius.—The Evils and the Advantages of Poetry exemplified in the Fate of different Poets. Say, generous Power, benignant Nature, say, Who temp'rest with thy touch our human clay, Warming the fields of Thought with genial care, The various fruits of mental growth to bear; Shall not thy vot'ries glow with just disdain, When Sloth or Spleen thy bounteous hand arraign? Art thou the Niggard they pretend thou art, A grudging Parent with a Stepdame's heart; And dost thou shed, with rare, reluctant toil, Bright Fancy's germens in the mental soil? Is Genius, thy sweet Plant of richest power, Whose dearly-priz'd and long-expected flower More tardy than the Aloe's bloom appears, Ordain'd to blow but in a thousand years? Perish the sickly thought—let those who hold Thy quick'ning influence so coy, so cold, Calmly the habitable earth survey, From time's first æra to the passing day; In what rude clime, beneath what angry skies, Have plants Poetic never dar'd to rise? In torrid regions, where 'tis toil to think, Where souls in stupid ease supinely sink; And where the native of the desert drear Yields to blank darkness half his icy year; In these unfriendly scenes, where each extreme Of heat and cold forbids the mind to teem, Poetic blossoms into Being start, Spontaneous produce of the feeling heart. Can we then deem that in those happier lands, Where every vital energy expands; Where Thought, the golden harvest of the mind, Springs into rich luxuriance, unconfin'd; That in such soils, with mental weeds o'ergrown, The seeds of Poesy were thinly sown? Shall we deny the labor of the swain, Who to the cultur'd earth confides the grain, If all the vagrant harpies of the air From its new bed the pregnant treasure tear; If, when scarce rising, with a stem infirm, It dies the victim of the mining worm; If mildew, riding in the eastern gust, Turns all its ripening gold to sable dust? These foes combin'd (and with them who may cope?) Are not more hostile to the Farmer's hope, Than Life's keen passions to that lighter grain Of Fancy, scatter'd o'er the infant brain. Pleasure, the rambling Bird! the painted Jay! May snatch the richest seeds of Verse away; Or Indolence, the worm that winds with art Thro' the close texture of the cleanest heart, May, if they haply have begun to shoot, With partial mischief wound the sick'ning root; Or Avarice, the mildew of the soul, May sweep the mental field, and blight the whole; Nay, the meek errors of the modest mind, To its own vigor diffidently blind, And that cold spleen, which falsely has declar'd The powers of Nature and of Art impair'd, The gate that Genius has unclos'd may guard, And rivet to the earth the rising Bard: For who will quit, tho' from mean aims exempt, The cares that summon, and the joys that tempt In many a lonely studious hour to try Where latent springs of Poesy may lie; Who will from social ease his mind divorce, To prove in Art's wide field its secret force, If, blind to Nature's frank parental love, He deems that Verse, descended from above, Like Heaven's more sacred signs, whose time is o'er, A gift miraculous, conferr'd no more? O Prejudice! thou bane of Arts, thou pest, Whose ruffian powers the free-born soul arrest; Thou who, dethroning Reason, dar'st to frame And issue thy proud laws beneath her name; Thou Coaster on the intellectual deep, Ordering each timid bark thy course to keep; Who, lest some daring mind beyond thee steer, Hast rais'd, to vouch thy vanity and fear, Herculean pillars where thy sail was furl'd, And nam'd thy bounds the Limits of the World. Thou braggart, Prejudice, how oft thy breath Has doom'd young Genius to the shades of death! How often has thy voice, with brutal fire Forbidding Female hands to touch the lyre, Deny'd to Woman, Nature's fav'rite child, The right to enter Fancy's opening wild! Blest be this smiling hour, when Britain sees Her Fair-ones cancel such absurd decrees, In one harmonious group, with graceful scorn, Spring o'er the Pedant's fence of wither'd thorn, And reach Parnassian heights, where, laurel-crown'd, This softer Quire the notes of triumph sound; Where Seward, leader of the lovely train, Pours o'er heroic tombs her potent strain; Potent to sooth the honor'd dead, and dart Congenial virtue thro' each panting heart; Potent thro' spirits masculine to spread Poetic jealousy and envious dread, If Love and Envy could in union rest, And rule with blended sway a Poet's breast: The Bards of Britain, with unjaundic'd eyes, Will glory to behold such rivals rise. Proceed, ye Sisters of the tuneful Shell, Without a scruple, in that Art excel, Which reigns, by virtuous Pleasure's soft controul, In sweet accordance with the Female soul; Pure as yourselves, and, like your charms, design'd To bless the earth, and humanize mankind. Where'er that Parent of engaging thought, Warm Sensibility, like light, has taught The bright'ning mirror of the mind to shew Nature's reflected forms in all their glow; Where in full tides the fine affections roll, And the warm heart invigorates the soul; In that rich spot, where winds propitious blow, Culture may teach poetic Fame to grow. Refin'd Invention and harmonious Rhyme, Are the slow gifts of Study and of Time; But to the Bard whom all the Muses court, His Sports are study, and his Studies sport. E'en at this period, when all tongues declare Poetic talents are a gift most rare, Unnumber'd Spirits, in our generous isle, Are ripening now beneath kind Nature's smile, Whom happy care might lead to lasting fame, And art ennoble with a Poet's name. Not that 'tis granted this high prize to gain By light effusions of a sportive vein, The idle Ballad of a summer's morn, The child of Frolic, in a moment born: Who views such trifles with a vain regard, But ill deserves the mighty name of Bard; In diff'rent tints see virtuous Gresset trace The genuine spirit of Poetic race: Let the true Bard (this pleasing Poet sings) Bid his fair fame on strong foundations rest; His be each honor that from Genius springs, Esteem'd by Judgment, and by Love carest; His the Ambition, that in climes unknown, Where'er his wand'ring volume may extend, Where'er that Picture of his mind is shewn, In every Reader he may find a Friend. Be it his aim to dart the living ray Of purest pleasure o'er th' enlighten'd earth; And in sweet union let his works display The Poet's fancy and the Patriot's worth. Thus far, O Gresset, on these points agreed, My soul professes thy Poetic Creed; Tho' the soft languor of thy song I blame, Which present ease prefers to future fame, Thy nobler maxims I with pride embrace, That Verse shou'd ever rise on Virtue's base, And every master of this matchless art Exalt the Spirit, and improve the Heart; And many a Youth, now rising into Man, Might build his glory on this noble plan, With latent powers to make the structure last Till Nature dies, and Time itself be past: But O, how intricate the chances lurk, Whose power may drive him from the doubtful work! Of the strong minds by chaste Ambition nurst, Who burn to rank in Honor's line the first, One leaves the Lyre to seize the martial crown, And one may drop it at a Parent's frown; For still with scorn, which anxious fear inflames, Parental care 'gainst Poesy declaims! “Fly, fly, my son, (the fond adviser cries) “That thorny path, where every peril lies; “Oh! be not thou by that vain Art betray'd, “Whose pains are Substance, and whose joys are Shade! “Mark, in the Muses' miserable throng, “What air-built visions cheat the Sons of Song! “This is a lesson taught in every street, “And Bards may read it at each Stall they meet: “Take the first book, behold in many a page “What promises of life from age to age; “The Poet swears himself he ne'er shall die, “A troop of rhyming friends support the lie: “Yet see how soon in Lethe's stream expire “This leading Bard and his attendant Quire, “And round these boards, their unexpected bier, “Their ghosts breathe wisdom in the passing ear: “For Stalls, like Church-yards, moral truth supply, “And teach the visionary Bard to die. “If present fame, thy airy hope, be gain'd, “By vigils purchas'd, and by toil maintain'd, “What base alloy must sink the doubtful prize, “Which Envy poisons, and which Spleen denies! “Observe what ills the living Bard attend, “Neglect his lot, and Penury his end! “Behold the world unequally requite “Two Arts that minister to chaste delight, “Twin-sisters, who with kindred beauty strike, “In fortune different, as in charms alike: “Painting, fair Danae! has her Golden shower, “But Want is Poesy's proverbial dower. “See, while with brilliant genius, ill applied, “The noble Rubens flatters Royal pride, “Makes all the Virtues, who abjur'd him, wait “On abject James, in allegoric state; “O'er the base Pedant his rich radiance flings, “And deifies the meanest of our Kings; “His Son rewards, and Honor owns the deed, “The splendid Artist with a princely meed. “Now turn to Milton's latter days, and see “How Bards and Painters in their fate agree; “Behold him sell his heaven-illumin'd page, “Mirac'lous child of his deserted age, “For such a pittance, so ignobly slight, “As wounded Learning blushes to recite! “If changing times suggest the pleasing hope, “That Bards no more with adverse fortune cope; “That in this alter'd clime, where Arts increase, “And make our polish'd Isle a second Greece; “That now, if Poesy proclaims her Son, “And challenges the wreath by Fancy won; “Both Fame and Wealth adopt him as their heir, “And liberal Grandeur makes his life her care; “From such vain thoughts thy erring mind defend, “And look on Chatterton's disastrous end. “Oh, ill-starr'd Youth, whom Nature form'd, in vain, “With powers on Pindus' splendid height to reign! “O dread example of what pangs await “Young Genius struggling with malignant fate! “What could the Muse, who fir'd thy infant frame “With the rich promise of Poetic fame; “Who taught thy hand its magic art to hide, “And mock the insolence of Critic pride; “What cou'd her unavailing cares oppose, “To save her darling from his desperate foes; “From pressing Want's calamitous controul, “And Pride, the fever of the ardent soul? “Ah, see, too conscious of her failing power, “She quits her Nursling in his deathful hour! “In a chill room, within whose wretched wall “No cheering voice replies to Misery's call; “Near a vile bed, too crazy to sustain “Misfortune's wasted limbs, convuls'd with pain, “On the bare floor, with heaven-directed eyes, “The hapless Youth in speechless horror lies! “The pois'nous vial, by distraction drain'd, “Rolls from his hand, in wild contortion strain'd: “Pale with life-wasting pangs, its dire effect, “And stung to madness by the world's neglect, “He, in abhorrence of the dangerous Art, “Once the dear idol of his glowing heart, “Tears from his Harp the vain detested wires, “And in the frenzy of Despair expires! “Pernicious Poesy! thy baleful sway “Exalts to weaken, flatters to betray; “When thy fond Votary has to thee resign'd “The captive powers of his deluded mind, “Fantastic hopes his swelling breast inflame, “Tempestuous passions tear his shatter'd frame, “Which sinks; for round it seas of trouble roar, “Admitting agony at every pore; “While Dullness, whom no tender feelings check, “Grins at his ruin, and enjoys the wreck; “Seen thro' the mist which clouds her heavy eyes, “The faults of Genius swell to double size, “His generous faults, which her base pride makes known, “Insulting errors so unlike her own. “Far then, my Son, far from this Syren steer; “Or, if her dulcet song must charm thy ear, “Let Reason bind thee, like the Greek of yore, “To catch her music, but escape her shore; “For never shall the wretch her power can seize, “Regain the port of Fortune, or of Ease.” Parental Fear thus warns the filial heart, From this alluring, this insidious Art; But, wounded thus by keen Invective's edge, Say, can the Muse no just defence alledge? In striking contrast has she not to paint Her prosp'rous Hero, as her murder'd Saint? 'Tis true, she oft has fruitless vigils kept, And oft, with unavailing sorrow, wept Her injur'd Vot'ries, doom'd to quit the earth In the sharp pangs of ill-requited worth. Ye noble Martyrs of poetic name, “Bliss to your Spirits, to your Mem'ries Fame!” By gen'rous Honor be your toils rever'd, To grateful Nature be your names endear'd! To all who Pity's feeling nerve possess, Doubly endear'd by undeserv'd distress. But, to relieve the pain your wrongs awake, O let the Muse her brighter records take, Review the crown by living Merit won, And share the triumph of each happier Son. If the young Bard who starts for Glory's goal, Can sate with present fame his ardent soul, Poetic story can with truth attest This rarest, richest prize in life possest. See the gay Poet of Italia's shore, Whom with fond zeal her feeling sons adore, Pass, while his heart with exultation beats, Poetic Mantua's applauding streets! See him, while Justice smiles, and Envy snarls, Receive the Laurel from Imperial Charles! And lo, th' unfading Gift still shines above Each perishable mark of Royal Love. If humbler views the tuneful mind inflame, If to be rich can be a Poet's aim, The Muse may shew, but in a different clime, Wealth, the fair produce of applauded Rhyme. Behold the fav'rite Bard of lib'ral Spain, Her wond'rous Vega, of exhaustless vein; From honest Poverty, his early lot, With honor sullied by no vicious blot, Behold him rise on Fortune's glittering wings, And almost reach the opulence of Kings; The high-soul'd Nobles of his native land Enrich their Poet with so frank a hand! For him Pieria's rock with treasure teems, For him her fountains gush with golden streams; And ne'er did Fortune, with a love more just, Her splendid stores to worthier hands entrust; For with the purest current, wide and strong, His Charity surpast his copious Song. If the Enthusiast higher hope pursues, If from his commerce with th' inspiring Muse He seeks to gain, by no mean aims confin'd, Freedom of thought and energy of mind; To raise his spirit, with ætherial fire, Above each little want and low desire; O turn where Milton flames with Epic rage, Unhurt by poverty, unchill'd by age: Tho' danger threaten his declining day, Tho' clouds of darkness quench his visual ray, The heavenly Muse his hallow'd spirit fills With raptures that surmount his matchless ills; From earth she bears him to bright Fancy's goal, And distant fame illuminates his soul! Too oft the wealthy, to proud follies born, Have turn'd from letter'd Poverty with scorn. Dull Opulence! thy narrow joys enlarge; To shield weak Merit is thy noblest charge: Search the dark scenes where drooping Genius lies, And keep from sorriest sights a nation's eyes, That, from expiring Want's reproaches free, Our generous country may ne'er weep to see A future Chatterton by poison dead, An Otway fainting for a little bread. If deaths like these deform'd our native isle, Some English Bards have bask'd in fortune's smile. Alike in Station and in Genius blest, By Knowledge prais'd, by Dignity carest, Pope's happy Freedom, all base wants above, Flow'd from the golden stream of Public Love; That richest antidote the Bard can seize, To save his spirit from its worst disease, From mean Dependance, bright Ambition's bane, Which blushing Fancy strives to hide in vain. To Pope the titled Patron joy'd to bend, Still more ennobled when proclaim'd his friend; For him the hands of jarring Faction join To heap their tribute on his Homer's shrine. Proud of the frank reward his talents find, And nobly conscious of no venal mind, With the just world his fair account he clears, And owns no debt to Princes or to Peers. Yet, while our nation feels new thirst arise For that pure joy which Poesy supplies, Bards, whom the tempting Muse enlists by stealth, Perceive their path is not the road to wealth, To honorable wealth, young Labor's spoil, The due reward of no inglorious toil; Whose well-earn'd comforts noblest minds engage, The just asylum of declining age; Else had we seen a warm Poetic Youth Change Fiction's roses for the thorns of Truth, From Fancy's realm, his native field, withdraw, To pay hard homage to severer Law? O thou bright Spirit, whom the Asian Muse Had fondly steep'd in all her fragrant dews, And o'er whose early Song, that mental feast, She breath'd the sweetness of the rifled East; Since independant Honor's high controul Detach'd from Poesy thy ardent soul, To seek with better hopes Persuasion's seat, Blest be those hopes, and happy that retreat! Which with regret all British Bards must see, And mourn a Brother lost in losing thee. Nor leads the Poet's path to that throng'd gate Where crouching Priests on proud Preferment wait; Where, while in vain a thousand vot'ries fawn, She robes her fav'rite few in hallow'd Lawn: Else, liberal Mason, had thy spotless name, The Ward of Virtue as the Heir of Fame, In lists of mitred Lords been still unread, While Mitres drop on many a Critic's head? Peace to all such, whose decent brows may bear Those sacred honors plac'd by Learning there; May just respect from brutal insult guard Their Crown, unenvied by the genuine Bard! Let Poesy, embellish'd by thy care, Pathetic Mason! with just pride declare, Thy breast must feel a more exulting fire, Than Pomp can give, or Dignity inspire, When Nature tells thee that thy Verse imparts The thrill of pleasure to ten thousand hearts; And often has she heard ingenuous Youth, Accomplish'd Beauty, and unbiass'd Truth, Those faithful harbingers of future fame, With tender interest pronounce thy name With lively gratitude for joy refin'd, Gift of thy Genius to the feeling mind. These are the honors which the Muse confers, The radiant Crown of living light is her's; And on thy brow she gave those gems to blaze, That far outshine the Mitre's transient rays; Gems that shall mock malignant Envy's breath, And shine still brighter thro' the shades of death. For me, who feel, whene'er I touch the lyre, My talents sink below my proud desire; Who often doubt, and sometimes credit give, When Friends assure me that my Verse will live; Whom health too tender for the bustling throng Led into pensive shade and soothing song; Whatever fortune my unpolish'd rhymes May meet, in present or in future times, Let the blest Art my grateful thoughts employ, Which sooths my sorrow and augments my joy; Whence lonely Peace and social Pleasure springs, And Friendship, dearer than the smile of Kings! While keener Poets, querulously proud, Lament the Ills of Poesy aloud, And magnify, with Irritation's zeal, Those common evils we too strongly feel, The envious Comment and the subtle Style Of specious Slander, stabbing with a smile; Frankly I wish to make her Blessings known, And think those Blessings for her Ills atone: Nor wou'd my honest pride that praise forego, Which makes Malignity yet more my foe. If heart-felt pain e'er led me to accuse The dangerous gift of the alluring Muse, 'Twas in the moment when my Verse imprest Some anxious feelings on a Mother's breast. O thou fond Spirit, who with pride hast smil'd, And frown'd with fear, on thy poetic child, Pleas'd, yet alarm'd, when in his boyish time He sigh'd in numbers, or he laugh'd in rhyme; While thy kind cautions warn'd him to beware Of Penury, the Bard's perpetual snare; Marking the early temper of his soul, Careless of wealth, nor fit for base controul: Thou tender Saint, to whom he owes much more Than ever Child to Parent ow'd before, In life's first season, when the fever's flame Shrunk to deformity his shrivell'd frame, And turn'd each fairer image in his brain To blank confusion and her crazy train, 'Twas thine, with constant love, thro' ling'ring years, To bathe thy idiot Orphan in thy tears; Day after day, and night succeeding night, To turn incessant to the hideous sight, And frequent watch, if haply at thy view Departed Reason might not dawn anew. Tho' medicinal art, with pitying care, Cou'd lend no aid to save thee from despair, Thy fond maternal heart adher'd to Hope and Prayer: Nor pray'd in vain; thy child from Pow'rs above Receiv'd the sense to feel and bless thy love; O might he thence receive the happy skill, And force proportion'd to his ardent will, With Truth's unfading radiance to emblaze Thy virtues, worthy of immortal praise! Nature, who deck'd thy form with Beauty's flowers, Exhausted on thy soul her finer powers; Taught it with all her energy to feel Love's melting softness, Friendship's fervid zeal, The generous purpose, and the active thought, With Charity's diffusive spirit fraught; There all the best of mental gifts she plac'd, Vigor of Judgment, purity of Taste, Superior parts, without their spleenful leaven, Kindness to Earth, and confidence in Heaven. While my fond thoughts o'er all thy merits roll, Thy praise thus gushes from my filial soul; Nor will the Public with harsh rigor blame This my just homage to thy honor'd name; To please that Public, if to please be mine, Thy Virtues train'd me—let the praise be thine. Since thou hast reach'd that world where Love alone, Where Love Parental can exceed thy own; If in celestial realms the blest may know And aid the objects of their care below, While in this sublunary scene of strife Thy Son possesses frail and feverish life, If Heaven allot him many an added hour, Gild it with virtuous thought and mental power, Power to exalt, with every aim refin'd, The loveliest of the Arts that bless mankind! END OF THE FOURTH EPISTLE. EPISTLE THE FIFTH. ARGUMENT OF THE FIFTH EPISTLE. Examination of the received opinion, that supernatural Agency is essential to the Epic Poem.—The folly and injustice of all arbitrary systems in Poetry. —The Epic province not yet exhausted.—Subjects from English History the most interesting.—A national Epic Poem the great desideratum in English literature.—The Author's wish of seeing it supplied by the genius of Mr. Mason. Ill-fated Poesy! as human worth, Prais'd, yet unaided, often sinks to earth; So sink thy powers; not doom'd alone to know Scorn, or neglect, from an unfeeling foe, But destin'd more oppressive wrong to feel From the misguided Friend's perplexing zeal. Such Friends are those, who in their proud display Of thy young beauty, and thy early sway, Pretend thou'rt robb'd of all thy warmth sublime, By the benumbing touch of modern Time. What! is the Epic Muse, that lofty Fair, Who makes the discipline of Earth her care! That mighty Minister, whom Virtue leads To train the noblest minds to noblest deeds! Is she, in office great, in glory rich, Degraded to a poor, pretended Witch, Who rais'd her spells, and all her magic power, But on the folly of the favoring hour? Whose dark, despis'd illusions melt away At the clear dawn of Philosophic day? To such they sink her, who lament her fall From the high Synod of th' Olympian Hall; Who worship System, hid in Fancy's veil. And think that all her Epic force must fail, If she no more can borrow or create Celestial Agents to uphold her state. To prove if this fam'd doctrine may be found To rest on solid, or on sandy ground, Let Critic Reason all her light diffuse O'er the wide empire of this injur'd Muse, To guide our search to every varied source And separate sinew of her vital force.— To three prime powers within the human frame, With equal energy she points her aim: By pure exalted Sentiment she draws From Judgment's steady voice no light applause; By Nature's simple and pathetic strains, The willing homage of the Heart she gains; The precious tribute she receives from these, Shines undebas'd by changing Time's decrees; The noble thought, that fir'd a Grecian soul, Keeps o'er a British mind its firm controul; The scenes, where Nature seems herself to speak, Still touch a Briton, as they touch'd a Greek: To captivate admiring Fancy's eyes, She bids celestial decorations rise; But, as a playful and capricious child Frowns at the splendid toy on which it smil'd; So wayward Fancy now with scorn surveys Those specious Miracles she lov'd to praise; Still fond of change, and fickle Fashion's dupe, Now keen to soar, and eager now to stoop, Her Gods, Dev'ls, Saints, Magicians, rise and fall, And now she worships each, now laughs at all. If then within the rich and wide domain O'er which the Epic Muse delights to reign, One province weaker than the rest be found, 'Tis her Celestial Sphere, or Fairy Ground: Her realm of Marvels is the distant land, O'er which she holds a perilous command; For, plac'd beyond the reach of Nature's aid, Here her worst foes her tottering force invade: O'er the wide precinct proud Opinion towers, And withers with a look its alter'd powers; While lavish Ridicule, pert Child of Taste! Turns the rich confine to so poor a waste, That some, who deem it but a cumbrous weight, Would lop this Province from its Parent State. What mighty voice first spoke this wond'rous law, Which ductile Critics still repeat with awe— That man's unkindling pirit must refuse A generous plaudit to th' Heroic Muse, Howe'er she paint her scenes of manly life, If no superior Agents aid the strife? In days of courtly wit, and wanton mirth, The loose Petronius gave the maxim birth; Perchance, to sooth the envious Nero's ear, And sink the Bard whose fame he sigh'd to hear; To injure Lucan, whose advent'rous mind, Inflam'd by Freedom, with just scorn resign'd Th' exhausted fables of the starry pole, And found a nobler theme in Cato's soul: To wound him, in the mask of Critic art, The subtle Courtier launch'd this venom'd dart, And following Critics, fond of Classic lore, Still echo the vain law from shore to shore; On Poets still for Deities they call, And deem mere earthly Bards no Bards at all. Yet, if by fits the mighty Homer nods, Where sinks he more than with his sleepy Gods? E'en Lucan proves, by his immortal name, How weak the dagger levell'd at his fame; For in his Song, which Time will ne'er forget, If Taste, who much may praise, will much regret, 'Tis not the absence of th' Olympian state, Embroil'd by jarring Gods in coarse debate: 'Tis nice arrangement, Nature's easy air, In scenes unfolded with superior care; 'Tis softer diction, elegantly terse, And the fine polish of Virgilian Verse. O blind to Nature! who assert the Muse Must o'er the human frame her empire lose, Failing to fly, in Fancy's wild career, Above this visible diurnal sphere! Behold yon pensive Fair! who turns with grief The tender Novel's soul-possessing leaf! Why with moist eyes to those soft pages glu'd, Forgetting her fix'd hours of sleep and food; Why does she keenly grasp its precious woes, Nor quit the volume till the story close? 'Tis not that Fancy plays her revels there, Cheating the mind with lucid forms of air; 'Tis not that Passion, in a style impure, Holds the warm spirit by a wanton lure: 'Tis suffering Virtue's sympathetic sway, That all the fibres of her breast obey; 'Tis Action, where Immortals claim no part; 'Tis Nature, grappled to the human heart. If this firm Sov'reign of the feeling breast Can thus the fascinated thought arrest, And thro' the bosom's deep recesses pierce, Ungrac'd, unaided by enchanting Verse, Say! shall we think, with limited controul, She wants sufficient force to seize the soul, When Harmony's congenial tones convey Charms to her voice, that aid its magic sway? If Admiration's hand, with eager grasp, Her darling Homer's deathless volume clasp, Say to what scenes her partial eyes revert! Say what they first explore, and last desert!— The scenes that glitter with no heavenly blaze, Where human agents human feelings raise, While Truth, enamour'd of the lovely line, Cries to their parent Nature, “These are thine.” When Neptune rises in Homeric state, And on their Lord the Powers of Ocean wait; Tho' pliant Fancy trace the steps he trod, And with a transient worship own the God, Yet colder readers with indifference view The Sovereign of the deep, and all his vassal crew, Nor feel his watery pomp their mind enlarge, More than the pageant of my Lord May'r's barge. But when Achilles' wrongs our eyes engage, All bosoms burn with sympathetic rage: And when thy love parental, Chief of Troy! Hastes to relieve the terrors of thy boy, Our senses in thy fond emotion join, And every heart's in unison with thine. Still in the Muse's ear shall Echo ring, That heavenly Agents are her vital spring? Those who conclude her winning charms arise From Beings darting from the distant skies, Appear to cherish a conceit as vain, As once was harbour'd in Neanthus' brain, When he believ'd that harmony must dwell In the cold concave of the Orphic shell: The ancient Lyre, to which the Thracian sung, Whose hallow'd chords were in a temple hung, The shallow Youth with weak ambition sought, And of the pilfering Priest the relique bought; Viewing his treasure with deluded gaze, He deem'd himself the heir of Orphic praise; But when his awkward fingers tried to bring Expected music from the silent string, Not e'en the milder brutes his discord bore, But howling dogs the fancied Orpheus tore. When the true Poet, in whose frame are join'd Softness of Heart and Energy of Mind, His Epic scene's expansive limit draws, Faithful to Nature's universal laws; If thro' her various walks he boldly range, Marking how oft her pliant features change; If, as she teaches, his quick powers supply Successive pictures to th' astonish'd eye, Where noblest passions noblest deeds inspire, And radiant souls exhibit all their fire; Where softer forms their sweet attractions blend, And suffering Beauty makes the world her friend; If thus he build his Rhyme, with varied art, On each dear interest of the human heart, His genius, by no vain conceits betray'd, May spurn faint Allegory's feeble aid. Th' Heroic Muse, in earthly virtue strong, May drive the host of Angels from her Song, As her fair Sister Muse, the Tragic Queen, Has banish'd Ghofts from her pathetic scene, Tho' her high soul, by Shakespeare's magic sway'd, Still bends to buried Denmark's awful Shade. If we esteem this Epic Queen so great, To spare her heavenly train, yet keep her state, 'Tis not our aim, with systematic pride, To sink their glory, or their powers to hide, Who add, when folded in the Muse's arms, Celestial beauty to her earthly charms. Sublimely fashion'd, by no mortal hands, The dome of mental Pleasure wide expands: Form'd to preside o'er its allotted parts, At different portals stand the separate Arts; But every portal different paths may gain, Alike uniting in the mystic Fane; Contentious mortals on these paths debate; Some, wrangling on the road, ne'er reach the gate, While others, arm'd with a despotic rod, Allow no pass but what themselves have trod. The noblest spirits, to this foible prone, Have slander'd powers congenial with their own: Hence, on a Brother's genius Milton frown'd, Scorning the graceful chains of final sound, And to one form confin'd the free sublime, Insulting Dryden as the Man of Rhyme. Caprice still gives this lasting struggle life; Rhyme and Blank Verse maintain their idle strife: The friends of one are still the other's foes, For stubborn Prejudice no mercy knows. As in Religion, Zealots, blindly warm, Neglect the Essence, while they grasp the Form; Poetic Bigots, thus perversely wrong, Think Modes of Verse comprize the Soul of Song. If the fine Statuary fill his part With all the powers of energetic Art; If to the figures, that, with skill exact, His genius blends in one impassion'd act, If to this Group such speaking force he give, That startled Nature almost cries, “They live;” All tongues with zeal th' enchanting work applaud, Nor the great Artist of due praise defraud, Whether he form'd the rich expressive mass Of Parian marble or Corinthian brass; For each his powers might fashion to fulfil The noblest purpose of mimetic skill; Each from his soul might catch Promethean fire, And speak his talents, till the world expire. 'Tis thus that Milton's Verse, and Dryden's Rhyme, Are proof alike against the rage of Time; Each Master modell'd, with a touch so bold, The rude materials which he chose to mould, That each his portion to perfection brought, Accomplishing the glorious end he sought. False to themselves, and to their interest blind, Are those cold judges, of fastidious mind, Who with vain rules the suffering Arts would load, Who, ere they smile, consult the Critic's code; Where, puzzled by the different doubts they see, (For who so oft as Critics disagree?) They lose that pleasure by free spirits seiz'd, In vainly settling how they should be pleas'd. Far wiser those, who, with a generous joy, Nor blindly fond, nor petulantly coy, Follow each movement of the varying Muse, Whatever step her airy form may chuse, Nor to one march her rapid feet confine, While ease and spirit in her gesture join; Those who facilitate her free desire, To melt the heart, or set the soul on fire; Who, if her voice to simple Nature lean, And fill with Human forms her Epic scene, Pleas'd with her aim, assist her moral plan, And feel with manly sympathy for Man: Or, if she draw, by Fancy's magic tones, Ætherial Spirits from their sapphire thrones, Her Heavenly shapes with willing homage greet, And aid, with ductile thought, her bright deceit; For, if the Epic Muse still wish to tower Above plain Nature's firm and graceful power, Tho' Critics think her vital powers are lost In cold Philosophy's petrific frost; That Magic cannot her sunk charms restore, That Heaven and Hell can yield her nothing more; Yet may she dive to many a secret source And copious spring of visionary force: India yet holds a Mythologic mine, Her strength may open, and her art refine: Tho' Asian spoils the realms of Europe fill, Those Eastern riches are unrifled still; Genius may there his course of honour run, And spotless Laurels in that field be won. Yet nobler aims the Bards of Britain court, Who steer by Freedom's star to Glory's port; Our gen'rous Isle, with far superior claim, Asks for her Chief the palm of Epic fame. In every realm where'er th' Heroic Muse Has deign'd her glowing spirit to infuse, Her tuneful Sons with civic splendor blaze, The honour'd Heralds of their country's praise, Save in our land, the nation of the earth Ordain'd to give the brightest Heroes birth!— By some strange fate, which rul'd each Poet's tongue, Her dearest Worthies yet remain unsung. Critics there are, who, with a scornful smile, Reject the annals of our martial Isle, And, dead to patriot Passion, coldly deem They yield for lofty Song no touching theme. What! can the British heart, humanely brave, Feel for the Greek who lost his female slave? Can it, devoted to a savage Chief, Swell with his rage, and soften with his grief? And shall it not with keener zeal embrace Their brighter cause, who, born of British race, With the strong cement of the blood they spilt, The splendid fane of British Freedom built? Blest Spirits! who, with kindred fire endued, Thro' different ages this bright work pursued, May Art and Genius crown your sainted band With that poetic wreath your Deeds demand! While, led by Fancy thro' her wide domain, Our steps advance around her Epic plain; While we survey each laurel that it bore, And every confine of the realm explore, See Liberty, array'd in light serene, Pours her rich lustre o'er th' expanding scene! Thee, Mason, thee she views with fond regard, And calls to nobler heights her fav'rite Bard. Tracing a circle with her blazing spear, “Here,” cries the Goddess, “raise thy fabric here, Build on these rocks, that to my reign belong, The noblest basis of Heroic Song! Fix here! and, while thy growing works ascend, My voice shall guide thee, and my arm defend.” As thus she speaks, methinks her high behest Imparts pure rapture to thy conscious breast, Pure as the joy immortal Newton found, When Nature led him to her utmost bound, And clearly shew'd, where unborn ages lie, The distant Comet to his daring eye; Pure as the joy the Sire of mortals knew, When blissful Eden open'd on his view, When first he listen'd to the voice Divine, And wond'ring heard, “This Paradise is thine.” With such delight may'st thou her gift receive! May thy warm heart with bright ambition heave To raise a Temple to her hallow'd name, Above what Grecian artists knew to frame! Of English form the sacred fabric rear, And bid our Country with just rites revere The Power, who sheds, in her benignant smile, The brightest Glory on our boasted Isle! Justly on thee th' inspiring Goddess calls; Her mighty task each weaker Bard appalls: 'Tis thine, O Mason! with unbaffled skill, Each harder duty of our Art to fill; 'Tis thine, in robes of beauty to array, And in bright Order's lucid blaze display, The forms that Fancy, to thy wishes kind, Stamps on the tablet of thy clearer mind. How softly sweet thy notes of pathos swell, The tender accents of Elfrida tell; Caractacus proclaims, with Freedom's fire, How rich the tone of thy sublimer Lyre; E'en in this hour, propitious to thy fame, The rural Deities repeat thy name: With festive joy I hear the sylvan throng Hail the completion of their favourite Song, Thy graceful Song! in honour of whose power, Delighted Flora, in her sweetest bower, Weaves thy unfading wreath;—with fondest care, Proudly she weaves it, emulously fair, To match that crown, which in the Mantuan grove The richer Ceres for her Virgil wove! See! his Eurydice herself once more Revisits earth from the Elysian shore! Behold! she hovers o'er thy echoing glade! Envy, not love, conducts the pensive Shade, Who, trembling at thy Lyre's pathetic tone, Fears lest Nerina's fame surpass her own. Thou happy Bard! whose sweet and potent voice Can reach all notes within the Poet's choice; Whose vivid soul has led thee to infuse Dramatic life in the preceptive Muse; Since, blest alike with Beauty and with Force, Thou rivall'st Virgil in his sylvan course, O be it thine the higher palm to gain, And pass him in the wide Heroic plain! To sing, with equal fire, of nobler themes, To gild Historic Truth with Fancy's beams! To Patriot Chiefs unsung thy Lyre devote, And swell to Liberty the lofty note! With humbler aim, but no ungenerous view, My steps, less firm, their lower path pursue; Of different Arts I search the ample field, Mark its past fruits, and what it yet may yield; With willing voice the praise of Merit found, And bow to Genius wheresoever found; O'er my free Verse bid noblest names preside, Tho' Party's hostile lines those names divide; Party! whose murdering spirit I abhor, More subtly cruel, and less brave than War. Party! insidious Fiend! whose vapors blind The light of Justice in the brightest mind; Whose feverish tongue, whence deadly venom flows, Basely belies the merit of her foes! O that my Verse with magic power were blest, To drive from Learning's field this baleful pest! Fond, fruitless wish! the mighty task would foil The firmest sons of Literary Toil; In vain a letter'd Hercules might rise To cleanse the stable where this Monster lies: Yet, if the Imps of her malignant brood, With all their Parent's acrid gall endu'd; If Spleen pours forth, to Mockery's apish tune, Her gibing Ballad, and her base Lampoon, On fairest names, from every blemish free, Save what the jaundic'd eyes of Party see; My glowing scorn will execrate the rhyme, Tho' laughing Humor strike its tuneful chime; Tho' keenest Wit the glitt'ring lines invest With all the splendor of the Adder's crest. Sublimer Mason! not to thee belong The reptile beauties of envenom'd Song. Thou chief of living Bards! O be it ours, In fame tho' different, as of different powers, Party's dark clouds alike to rise above, And reach the firmament of Public Love! May'st thou ascend Parnassus' highest mound, In triumph there the Epic Trumpet sound; While, with no envious zeal, I thus aspire By just applause to fan thy purer fire; And of the Work which Freedom pants to see, Which thy firm Genius claims reserv'd for thee, In this frank style my honest thoughts impart, If not an Artist yet a friend to Art!

      <field name="fulltext">VOL. IV. TRANSLATIONS TAKEN FROM THE NOTES TO THE THIRD EPISTLE OF AN ESSAY ON EPIC POETRY IMITATION. Henry! I wish that you, and Charles, and I, By some sweet spell within a bark were plac'd, A gallant bark with magic virtue grac'd, Swift at our will with every wind to fly: So that no changes of the shifting sky, No stormy terrors of the watery waste, Might bar our course, but heighten still our taste Of sprightly joy, and of our social tie: Then, that my Lucy, Lucy fair and free, With those soft nymphs on whom your souls are bent, The kind magician might to us convey, To talk of love throughout the live-long day; And that each fair might be as well content As I in truth believe our hearts would be. THE INFERNO OF DANTE. CANTO I. In the mid season of this mortal strife, I found myself within a gloomy grove, Far wandering from the ways of perfect life: The place I know not, where I chanc'd to rove; It was a wood so wild, it wounds me sore But to remember with what ills I strove: Such still my dread, that death is little more. But I will tell the good which there I found. High things 'twas there my fortune to explore: Yet how I enter'd on that secret ground I know not to explain; so much in sleep My mortal senses at that hour were drown'd. But when I reach'd the bottom of a steep, That rose to terminate the dreary vale, Which made cold terrors thro' my bosom creep, I look'd on high, where breath'd a purer gale, And saw the summit glisten with that ray Which leads the wand'rer safe o'er hill and dale. This soon began to chase those fears away, Which held my struggling spirit bound so fast During that night of darkness and dismay: And, as th' exausted wretch, by fortune cast Safe from the stormy deep upon the shore, Turns to survey the perils he has past, So turn'd my soul, ere yet its dread was o'er, Back to contemplate that mysterious strait Where living mortal never past before. Arising soon from this repose elate, Up the rough steep my journey I begin, My lower foot sustaining all my weight. Here, while my toilsome way I slowly win, Behold a nimble Panther springs to sight! And beauteous spots adorn his motley skin: He at my presence shew'd no signs of fright, But rather strove to bar my doubtful way; I often turn'd, and oft resolv'd on flight. 'Twas now the chearful hour of rising day; The sun advanc'd in that propitious sign Which first beheld his radiant beams display Creation's charms, the work of love divine! So that I now was rais'd to hope sublime, By these bright omens of a fate benign, The beauteous Beast and the sweet hour of prime. But soon I lost that hope; and shook yet more To see a Lion in this lonely clime: With open jaws, athirst for human gore, He rush'd towards me in his hungry ire; Air seem'd to tremble at his savage roar. With him, enflam'd with every fierce desire, A famish'd She-wolf, like a spectre, came; Beneath whose gripe shall many a wretch expire. Such sad oppression seiz'd my sinking frame, Such horror at these strange tremendous sights, My hopes to climb the hill no longer aim; But, as the wretch whom lucre's lust incites, In the curst hour which scatters all his wealth, Sinks in deep sorrow, dead to all delights, So was I robb'd of all my spirit's health, And to the quarter where the sun grows mute, Driven by this Beast, who crept on me by stealth. While I retreated from her dread pursuit, A manly figure my glad eyes survey'd, Whose voice was like the whisper of a lute. Soon as I saw him in this dreary glade, Take pity on me, to this form I cry'd, Be thou substantial man, or fleeting shade!— A man I was (the gracious form reply'd) And both my parents were of Lombard race; They in their native Mantua liv'd and dy'd: I liv'd at Rome, rich in a monarch's grace, Beneath the good Augustus' letter'd reign, While fabled Gods were serv'd with worship base. A Bard I was: the subject of my strain That just and pious Chief who sail'd from Troy, Sinking in ashes on the sanguine plain. But thou, whom these portentous sights annoy, Why dost thou turn? why not ascend the mount, Source of all good, and summit of all joy!— Art thou that Virgil? thou! that copious fount Of richest eloquence, so clear, so bright? I answer'd, blushing at his kind account; O thou! of Poets the pure guide and light! Now let me profit by that fond esteem Which kept thy song for ever in my sight! Thou art my Master! thou my Bard supreme, From whom alone my fond ambition drew That purer style which I my glory deem! O! from this Beast, so hideous to the view, Save me! O save me! thou much-honour'd Sage! For growing terrors all my power subdue.— A different road must lead thee from her rage, (He said, observant of my starting tears) And from this wild thy spirit disengage; For that terrific Beast, which caus'd thy fears, Worries each wretch that in her road she spies, Till death at length, his sole relief, appears. So keen her nature, sleep ne'er seals her eyes; Her ravenous hunger no repast can sate; Food only serves to make its fury rise. She calls from different animals her mate; And long shall she produce an offspring base, Then from a mighty victor meet her fate. Nor pomp nor riches shall that victor grace, But truth, and love, and all excelling worth; He from his rescu'd land all ill shall chase, The saviour of the realm that gives him birth, Of Italy, for whom Camilla fell, And Turnus, fighting for his native earth, And Nisus, with the friend he lov'd so well. The Beast this victor to that den shall drive Whence Envy let her loose, her native hell! Now for thy good, well-pleas'd, I will contrive, That by my aid, while I thy steps controul, Thou shalt in safety at those realms arrive Where thou shalt see the tortur'd spirits roll, And hear each mourn his miserable fate, Calling for death on his immortal soul. Then shalt thou visit those, who in a state Of purifying fire are still content, And for their promis'd heaven submissive wait: If to that heaven thy happy course is bent, A worthier guard will soon my place supply; A purer spirit, for thy guidance sent! For that Immortal Power, who rules on high, Because I ne'er his perfect laws have known, His sacred presence will to me deny. There in the realms of light he fix'd his throne; There o'er the world Almighty Lord he reigns: O blest the servant whom he deigns to own!— Poet (I answer'd) by thy living strains, And by that God, tho' not reveal'd to thee, That I may 'scape from these, and heavier pains, Be thou my leader, where thy way is free! So that my eyes St. Peter's gate may find, And all the wonders of the deep may see! He led, and I attentive march'd behind. CANTO II. The day was sinking, and the dusky air On all the animals of earth bestow'd Rest from their labours. I alone prepare To meet new toil, both from my dreary road, And pious wish to paint in worthy phrase The Unerring Mind, and his divine abode. O sacred Muses! now my genius raise! O Memory, who writest what I saw, From hence shall spring thy ever-during praise! Kind Poet (I began, with trembling awe) Mark if my soul be equal to this aim! Nor into scenes too hard my weakness draw! Thy Song declares, the Chief of pious fame Appear'd among the blest, retaining still His mortal senses and material frame; Yet, if the great Opposer of all ill Shew'd grace to him, as knowing what and who Should from him rise, and mighty things fulfil, Most worthy he appear'd, in Reason's view, That Heaven should chuse him as the Roman Sire, Scource of that empire which so widely grew, Mark'd in its growth by the angelic choir To be the seat where Sanctity should rest, And Peter's heirs yet raise dominion higher. From his dark journey, in thy Song exprest, He learn'd mysterious things; from whence arose Rome's early grandeur and the Papal vest. To Paul, while living, heaven's high powers disclose Their secret bliss, that he may thence receive Strength in that faith from which salvation flows. But how may I this high exploit atchieve? I'm not Æneas, nor the holy Paul: Of this unworthy I myself believe: If then I follow at thy friendly call, Midway perchance my trembling soul may sink: Wise as thou art, thou may'st foresee my fall. Now as a man who, shudd'ring on the brink Of some great venture, sudden shifts his mind, And feels his spirit from the peril shrink; So, in this scene of doubt and darkness join'd, Wavering I wasted thought in wild affright, And the first ardour of my soul resign'd. If thy faint words I understand aright, (Reply'd the mighty and magnanimous shade) Those mists of fear have dimm'd thy mental sight, Which oft the feat of human sense invade, And make blind mortals from high deeds recoil, By Terror's airy phantasies betray'd: But, that such fears thy soul no more may soil, I'll tell thee whence I came; at whose request; When first I pitied thy uncertain toil. From the suspended host in which I rest, A lovely Spirit call'd me, fair as light; Eager I waited on her high behest; While eyes beyond the solar radiance bright, And with the sweetness of an angel's tongue, Thus her soft words my willing aid invite: O ever gentle shade, from Mantua sprung! Whose fame unfading on the earth shall last As long as earth in ambient air is hung; My friend, whose love all base desire surpast, In yon drear desart finds his passage barr'd, And compass'd round with terrors stands aghast; And much I fear, beset with dangers hard, He may be lost beyond all friendly reach, And I from heaven descend too late a guard. But go! and with thy soft soul-soothing speech, And all the aid thy wisdom may inspire, The ways of safety to this wanderer teach! My name is Beatrice: the heavenly quire For this I left, tho' ever left with pain; But love suggested what I now desire. When I the presence of my lord regain, On thee my praises with delight shall dwell. So spake this angel, in her heavenly strain. Bright Fair, (I cry'd) who didst on earth excel All that e'er shone beneath the lunar sphere, And every mind to virtuous love impel! Had I e'en now perform'd the task I hear, That swift performance I should think too slow: Nor needs there more; your gracious will is clear: Yet how you venture, I would gladly know, From those pure realms, to which again you fly, So near the center of eternal woe. What you require (she said, in kind reply) I briefly will explain: how thus I dare, Unconscious of alarm, these depths to try. From these things only springs our fearful care, By which our hapless friends may suffer ill; But not from other; for no fear is there. Such am I form'd, by Heaven's most gracious will, That torture cannot touch my purer frame, E'en where fierce fires his flaming region fill. A gentle spirit (Lucia is her name) In heaven laments the hardships of my friend, For whom I ask your aid: to me she came, And kindly bade me to his woes attend: Behold (she said) thy servant in distress! And I his safety to thy care commend. Lucia, the friend of all whom ills oppress, Me, where I sate with pensive Rachel, sought, In heavenly contemplation's deep recess: In mercy's name (she cry'd) thus lost in thought, Seest thou not him who held thy charms so dear, Whom Love to rise above the vulgar taught? And dost thou not his lamentation hear, Nor see the horror, which his strength impairs, On yon wide torrent, with no haven near? Never was mind, intent on worldly cares, So eager wealth to gain, or loss to shun, As, when acquainted with these deadly snares, I flew from the blest confines of the sun, Trusting that eloquence, which to thy name And to thy followers such praise has won. She having thus explain'd her gracious aim, Turn'd her bright eyes, which tears of pity fill: And hence more swift to thy relief I came; And, pleas'd to execute her heavenly will, I sav'd thee from the fury of that Beast, Which barr'd thy journey up the brighter hill. Why then, O why has all thy ardour ceas'd? And whence this faintness in thy feeble mind? Why has its noble energy decreas'd, When these pure Spirits, for thy good combin'd, Watch o'er thy safety in their heavenly seat, And I reveal the favour thou shalt find?— As tender flowers, reviv'd by solar heat, That thro' the chilling night have sunk deprest, Rise and unfold, the welcome ray to meet; So rose my spirit, of new life possest; And, my warm heart on high atchievements bent, I thus my animating guide addrest: Gracious that Spirit who thy succour sent! And friendly thou, who freely hast display'd Thy zeal to execute her kind intent! Thy soothing words have to my soul convey'd Such keen desire to those bright realms to soar, I scorn the terror that my step delay'd. Now lead!—thy pleasure I dispute no more. My lord, my master thou! and thou my guard!— I ended here; and, while he march'd before, The gloomy road I enter'd, deep and hard. CANTO III. “Thro' me you pass to Mourning's dark domain; Thro' me, to scenes where Grief must ever pine; Thro' me, to Misery's devoted train. Justice and power in my Great Founder join, And love and wisdom all his fabrics rear; Wisdom above controul, and love divine! Before me, Nature saw no works appear. Save works eternal: such was I ordain'd. Quit every hope, all ye who enter here!”— These characters, where misty darkness reign'd, High o'er a lofty gate I saw engrav'd. Ah Sire! (said I) hard things are here contain'd. He, sapient Guide! my farther question sav'd, With spirit answering, “Here all doubt resign, All weak distrust, and every thought deprav'd; At length we've reach'd that gloomy drear confine, Where, as I said, thou'lt see the mournful race For ever robb'd of Reason's light benign.” Then, stretching forth his hand with gentle grace, From whence new comfort thro' my bosom flows, He led me in to that mysterious place. There sighs, and wailings, and severest woes, Deeply resounded through the starless air; And as I first advanc'd, my fears arose. Each different cry, the murmuring notes of care, Accents of misery, and words of ire, With all the sounds of discord and despair, To form such tumult in this scene conspire, As flies for ever round the gloomy waste, Like sand when quicken'd by the whirlwind's fire. I then (my mind with error still disgrac'd) Exclaim'd—O Sire! what may this trouble mean? What forms are these by sorrow so debas'd?— He soon reply'd—Behold, these bounds between, All who without or infamy or fame Clos'd the blank business of their mortal scene! They join those angels, of ignoble name, Who not rebell'd, yet were not faithful found; Without attachment! self alone their aim! Heaven shuts them out from its unsullied bound: And Hell refuses to admit this train, Leste'en the damn'd o'er these their triumphs sound. O Sire! (said I) whence then this grievous pain, That on our ears their lamentations grate?— This (he reply'd, I will in brief explain: These have no hope that death may mend their fate; And their blind days form so confus'd a mass, They pine with envy of each other's state: From earth their name has perish'd like the grass: E'en Mercy views them with a scornful eye. We'll speak of them no more: Behold! and pass!— I look'd, and saw a banner rais'd on high, That whirl'd, unconscious of a moment's stand, With rapid circles in the troubled sky: Behind it, driven by Fate's supreme command, Came such a host! I ne'er could have believ'd Death had collected so complete a band. When now I had the forms of all perceiv'd, I saw the shade of that ignoble priest, Of sovereign power by indolence bereav'd. Instant I knew, from every doubt releas'd, These were the base, the miscreated crew To whom the hate of God had never ceas'd. Vile forms! ne'er honor'd with existence true! Naked they march'd, and sorely were they stung By wasps and hornets, that around them flew; These the black blood from their gall'd faces wrung; Blood mixt with tears, that, trickling to their feet, Fed the fastidious worms which round them clung. When now I farther pierc'd the dark retreat, Numbers I saw beside a mighty stream: Sudden I cry'd—Now, Sire, let me entreat To know what forms in distant prospect seem To pass so swiftly o'er a flood so wide, As I discern by this imperfect gleam?— That shalt thou know (return'd my gracious Guide) When the near respite from our toil we reach, On sullen Acheron's infernal tide.— With downcast eyes, that pardon now beseech, And hoping silence may that pardon win, E'en to the river I abstain'd from speech. And lo! towards us, with a shrivell'd skin, A hoary boatman steers his crazy bark, Exclaiming, “Woe to all ye sons of sin! Hope not for heaven, nor light's celestial spark! I come to waft you to a different lot; To Torture's realm, with endless horror dark: And thou, who living view'st this sacred spot, Haste to depart from these, for these are dead!” But when he saw that I departed not, In wrath he cry'd, “Thro' other passes led, Not here, shalt thou attempt the farther shore; But in a bark to bear thy firmer tread.”— O Charon, said my Guide, thy strife give o'er; For thus 'tis will'd in that superior scene Where will is power. Seek thou to know no more!— Now grew the bearded visage more serene Of the stern boatman on the livid lake, Whose eyes so lately glar'd with anger keen: But all the naked shades began to quake; Their shuddering figures grew more pale than earth, Soon as they heard the cruel words he spake: God they blasphem'd, their parents' injur'd worth, And all mankind; the place, the hour, that saw Their first formation, and their future birth. Then were they driven, by Fate's resistless law, Weeping, to that sad scene prepar'd for all Who fear not God with pure devotion's awe. Charon, with eyes of fire and words of gall, Collects his crew, and high his oar he wields, To strike the tardy wretch who slights his call. As leaves in autumn thro' the woody fields Fly in succession, when each trembling tree Its ling'ring honors to the whirlwind yields; So this bad race, condemn'd by Heaven's decree, Successive hasten from that river's side: As birds, which at a call to bondage flee, So are they wafted o'er the gloomy tide; And ere from thence their journey is begun, A second crew awaits their hoary guide.— My gracious Master kindly said—My son! All those who in the wrath of God expire, From every clime haste hither, one by one; Nor would their terrors from this stream retire, Since heavenly justice so impels their mind, That fear is quicken'd into keen desire. Here may no spirit pass, to good inclin'd; And hence, if Charon seem'd to thwart thy will, Hence wilt thou deem his purpose not unkind.— He paus'd; and horrors of approaching ill Now made the mournful troop so stand aghast, Their fears yet strike me with a deadly chill! The groaning earth sent forth a hollow blast, And flash'd a fiery glare of gloomy red! The horrid scene my fainting power surpast: I fell, and, as in sleep, my senses fled. SONNET FROM THE LADY LEONORA DE ICIZ, BARONESS OF RAFALES, TO DON ALONZO DE ERCILLA. Marble, that forms the Hero's mimic frame, And laurels, that reward the Poet's strain, Accept, Ercilla, from thy grateful Spain! Thy sword and pen alike this tribute claim. Our Warriors honour thy heroic name; Thy birth is envy'd by Ambition's train; Thy verses teach the Bard of happiest vein A finer polish, and a nobler aim. May glory round the world thy merit spread! In Memory's volume may thy praises stand, In characters that time shall ne'er destroy! Thy songs, and thy exploits, without the dread To be surpass'd by a superior hand, With equal right their equal fame enjoy! A SKETCH OF THE ARAUCANA.Hayley's translations include only extracts from the original poems. CANTO I. I Sing not love of ladies, nor of sights Devis'd for gentle dames by courteous knights; Nor feasts, nor tourneys, nor that tender care Which prompts the Gallant to regale the Fair; But the bold deeds of Valour's fav'rite train, Those undegenerate sons of warlike Spain, Who made Arauco their stern laws embrace, And bent beneath their yoke her untam'd race. Of tribes distinguish'd in the field I sing; Of nations who disdain the name of King; Courage, that danger only taught to grow, And challenge honour from a generous foe; And persevering toils of purest fame, And feats that aggrandize the Spanish name: For the brave actions of the vanquish'd spread The brightest glory round the victor's head. CANTO II. Many there are who, in this mortal strife, Have reach'd the slippery heights of splendid life: For Fortune's ready hand its succour lent; Smiling she rais'd them up the steep ascent, To hurl them headlong from that lofty seat To which she led their unsuspecting feet; E'en at the moment when all fears disperse, And their proud fancy sees no sad reverse. Little they think, beguil'd by fair success, That Joy is but the herald of Distress: The hasty wing of Time escapes their sight, And those dark evils that attend his flight: Vainly they dream, with gay presumption warm, Fortune for them will take a steadier form; She, unconcern'd at what her victims feel, Turns with her wonted haste her fatal wheel. The Indians first, by novelty dismay'd, As Gods rever'd us, and as Gods obey'd; But when they found we were of woman born, Their homage turn'd to enmity and scorn: Their childish error when our weakness show'd, They blush'd at what their ignorance bestow'd; Fiercely they burnt with anger and with shame, To see their masters but of mortal frame. Disdaining cold and cowardly delay, They seek atonement, on no distant day: Prompt and resolv'd, in quick debate they join, To form of deep revenge their dire design. Impatient that their bold decree should spread, And shake the world around with sudden dread, Th' assembling Chieftains led so large a train, Their ready host o'erspread th' extensive plain. No summons now the soldier's heart requires; The thirst of battle every breast inspires; No pay, no promise of reward, they ask, Keen to accomplish their spontaneous task; And, by the force of one avenging blow, Crush and annihilate their foreign foe. Of some brave Chiefs, who to this council came, Well may'st thou, Memory, preserve the name; Tho' rude and savage, yet of noble soul, Justly they claim their place on Glory's roll, Who robbing Spain of many a gallant son, In so confin'd a space such victories won; Whose fame some living Spaniards yet may spread, Too well attested by our warlike dead. Assembled Chiefs! ye guardians of the land! Think not I mourn from thirst of lost command, To find your rival spirits thus pursue A post of honour which I deem my due. These marks of age, you see, such thoughts disown In me, departing for the world unknown; But my warm love, which ye have long possest, Now prompts that counsel which you'll find the best. Why should we now for marks of glory jar? Why wish to spread our martial name afar? Crush'd as we are by Fortune's cruel stroke, And bent beneath an ignominious yoke, Ill can our minds such noble pride maintain, While the fierce Spaniard holds our galling chain. Your generous fury here ye vainly shew; Ah! rather pour it on th' embattled foe! What frenzy has your souls of sense bereav'd? Ye rush to self-perdition, unperceiv'd. 'Gainst your own vitals would ye lift those hands, Whose vigour ought to burst oppression's bands? If a desire of death this rage create, O die not yet in this disgraceful state! Turn your keen arms, and this indignant flame, Against the breast of those who sink your fame, Who made the world a witness of your shame. Haste ye to cast these hated bonds away, In this the vigour of your souls display; Nor blindly lavish, from your country's veins, Blood that may yet redeem her from her chains. E'en while I thus lament, I still admire The fervour of your souls; they give me fire: But justly trembling at their fatal bent, I dread some dire calamitous event; Lest in your rage Dissension's frantic hand Should cut the sinews of our native land. If such its doom, my thread of being burst, And let your old compeer expire the first! Shall this shrunk frame, thus bow'd by age's weight, Live the weak witness of a nation's fate? No: let some friendly sword, with kind relief, Forbid its sinking in that scene of grief. Happy whose eyes in timely darkness close, Sav'd from that worst of sights, his country's woes! Yet, while I can, I make your weal my care, And for the public good my thoughts declare. Equal ye are in courage and in worth; Heaven has assign'd to all an equal birth: In wealth, in power, and majesty of soul, Each Chief seems worthy of the world's controul. These gracious gifts, not gratefully beheld, To this dire strife your daring minds impell'd. But on your generous valour I depend, That all our country's woes will swiftly end. A Leader still our present state demands, To guide to vengeance our impatient bands; Fit for this hardy task that Chief I deem, Who longest may sustain a massive beam: Your rank is equal, let your force be try'd, And for the strongest let his strength decide. Tho' from his birth one darken'd eye he drew (The viewless orb was of the granite's hue), Nature, who partly robb'd him of his sight, Repaid this failure by redoubled might. This noble youth was of the highest state; His actions honour'd, and his words of weight: Prompt and resolv'd in every generous cause, A friend to Justice and her sternest laws: Fashion'd for sudden feats, or toils of length, His limbs possess'd both suppleness and strength: Dauntless his mind, determin'd and adroit In every quick and hazardous exploit. CANTO III. O cureless malady! Oh fatal pest! Embrac'd with ardour and with pride carest; Thou common vice, thou most contagious ill, Bane of the mind, and frenzy of the will! Thou foe to private and to public health; Thou dropsy of the soul, that thirsts for wealth, Insatiate Avarice!—'tis from thee we trace The various misery of our mortal race. The steady pikemen of the savage band, Waiting our hasty charge, in order stand; But when th' advancing Spaniard aim'd his stroke, Their ranks, to form a hollow square, they broke; An easy passage to our troop they leave, And deep within their lines their foes receive; Their files resuming then the ground they gave, Bury the Christians in that closing grave. As the keen Crocodile, who loves to lay His silent ambush for his finny prey, Hearing the scaly tribe with sportive sound Advance, and cast a muddy darkness round, Opens his mighty mouth, with caution, wide, And, when th' unwary fish within it glide, Closing with eager haste his hollow jaw, Thus satiates with their lives his rav'nous maw: So, in their toils, without one warning thought, The murd'rous foe our little squadron caught With quick destruction, in a fatal strife, From whence no Christian soldier 'scap'd with life. The hostile sword, now deeply dy'd in blood, Drench'd the wide field with many a sanguine flood; Courage still grows to form the fierce attack, But wasted vigour makes the combat slack: No pause they seek, to gain exhausted breath, No rest, except the final rest of death: The wariest combatants now only try To snatch the sweets of vengeance ere they die. The fierce disdain of death, and scorn of flight, Give to our scanty troop such wond'rous might, The Araucanian host begin to yield; They quit with loss and shame the long-fought field: They fly; and their pursuers shake the plain With joyous shouts of Victory and Spain. But dire mischance, and Fate's resistless sway, Gave a strange issue to the dreadful day. An Indian Youth, a noble Chieftain's son, Who as our friend his martial feats begun, Our Leader's Page, by him to battle train'd, Who now beside him the hard fight sustain'd, As he beheld his kindred Chiefs retire, Felt an indignant flash of Patriot fire; And thus incited to a glorious stand The flying champions of his native land: Misguided Country! by vain fear possest, Ah whither dost thou turn thy timid breast? Ye brave compatriots, shall your ancient fame Be vilely buried in this field of shame? Those laws, those rights, ye gloried to defend, All perish, all, by this ignoble end! From Chiefs of dreaded power, and honour'd worth, Ye sink to abject slaves, the scorn of earth! To the pure founders of your boasted race Ye give the cureless wound of deep disgrace! Behold the wasted vigour of your foe! See, bath'd in sweat and blood, their coursers blow! Lose not your mental force, your martial fires, Our best inheritance from generous fires; Sink not the noble Araucanian name From glory's summit to the depths of shame; Fly, fly the servitude your souls detest! To the keen sword oppose the dauntless breast. Why shew ye frames endued with manly power, Yet shrink from danger in the trying hour? Fix in your minds the friendly truth I speak; Vain are your fears, your terror blind and weak: Now make your names immortal; now restore Freedom's lost blessings to your native shore: Now turn, while Fame and Victory invite, While prosp'rous Fortune calls you to the fight; Or yet a moment cease, O cease to fly, And for our country learn of me to die! As thus he speaks, his eager steps advance, And 'gainst the Spanish Chief he points his lance; To lead his kindred fugitives from flight, Singly he dares to tempt th' unequal fight: Against our circling arms, that round him shine, Eager he darts amidst the thickest line, Keen as, when chaf'd by summer's fiery beam, The young Stag plunges in the cooling stream. Say, of these famous Chiefs can one exceed Or match this young Barbarian's noble deed? Vict'ry for them, her purpose unexplor'd, Tempted by equal chance their happy sword: What risk, what peril, did they boldly meet, Save where Ambition urg'd the splendid feat; Or mightier Int'rest fir'd the daring mind, Which makes a Hero of the fearful Hind? Many there are who with a brave disdain Face all the perils of the deathful plain, Who, fir'd by hopes of glory, nobly dare, Yet fail the stroke of adverse chance to bear; With animated fire their spirit shines, Till the short splendor of their day declines; But all their valour, all their strength expires, When fickle Fortune from their side retires. This youthful Hero, when the die was cast, War's dire decree against his country past, Made the stern Power the finish'd cause resume, And finally reverse the cruel doom: He, by his efforts in the dread debate, Forc'd the determin'd will of adverse Fate; From shouting Triumph rush'd the palm to tear, And fix'd it on the brow of faint Despair. CANTO IV. Here, cried a Spaniard, far unlike his race, Nor shall his abject name my verse debase, Marking his few associates march along, O that our band were but a hundred strong! The brave Gonsalo with disdain replied: Rather let two be sever'd from our side, Kind Heaven! that Memory may our feats proclaim, And call our little troop The Twelve of Fame! Now in the turbid air a stormy cloud Spreads its terrific shadow o'er the crowd; The gathering darkness hides the solar ray, And to th' affrighted earth denies the day; The rushing winds, to which the forests yield, Rive the tall tree, and desolate the field: In drops distinct and rare now falls the rain; And now with thickening fury beats the plain. As the bold master of the martial drum, Ere to the shock th' advancing armies come, In aweful notes, that shake the heaven's high arch, Intrepid strikes the slow and solemn march; But, when the charging heroes yield their breath, Doubles the horrid harmony of death: So the dark tempest, with increasing sound, Pours the loud deluge on the echoing ground. CANTO V. The vext air feels the thunder of the fight, And smoke and flame involve the mountain's height; Earth seems to open as the flames aspire, And new volcano's spout destructive fire. Lautaro saw no hopes of life allow'd, Save by dispersing this terrific cloud, That pours its lightning with so dire a shock, Smiting his lessen'd host, who strew the rock; And to the troop of Leucoton the brave His quick command the skilful Leader gave: He bids them fiercely to the charge descend, And thus exhorts aloud each ardent friend: My faithful partners in bright victory's meed, Whom fortune summons to this noble deed, Behold the hour when your prevailing might Shall prove that Justice guards us in the fight! Now firmly fix your lances in the rest, And rush to honour o'er each hostile breast; Through every bar your bloody passage force, Nor let a brother's fall impede your course; Be yon dread instruments of death your aim; Possest of these you gain eternal fame: The camp shall follow your triumphant trace, And own you leaders in the glorious chace. While these bold words their ardent zeal exalt, They rush impetuous to the rash assault. CANTO VI. The valiant mind is privileg'd to feel Superior to each turn of Fortune's wheel: Chance has no power its value to debase, Or brand it with the mark of deep disgrace: So thought the noble Villagran, our Chief, Who chose that death should end his present grief, And smooth the horrid path, with thorns o'erspread, Which Destiny condemn'd his feet to tread. CANTO VII. Their entrance in these walls let fancy paint, O'erwhelm'd with anguish, and with labour faint: These gash'd with ghastly wounds, those writh'd with pain, And some their human semblance scarce retain; They seem unhappy spirits 'scap'd from hell, Yet wanting voice their misery to tell. Their pangs to all their rolling eyes express, And silence most declares their deep distress. When weariness and shame at length allow'd Their tongues to satisfy th' enquiring crowd, From the pale citizens, amaz'd to hear A tale surpassing e'en their wildest fear, One general sound of lamentation rose, That deeply solemniz'd a nation's woes; The neighbouring mansions to their grief reply, And every wall return'd the mournful cry. 'Tis just that Fame a noble deed display, Which claims remembrance, even to the day When Memory's hand no more the pen shall use, But sink in darkness, and her being lose: The lovely Mencia, an accomplish'd Dame, A valiant spirit in a tender frame, Here firmly shew'd, as this dread scene began, Courage now found not in the heart of man. The bed of sickness 'twas her chance to press; But when she heard the city's loud distress, Snatching such weapons as the time allow'd, She rush'd indignant midst the flying crowd. Now up the neighbouring hill they slowly wind, And, bending oft their mournful eyes behind, Cast a sad look, of every hope bereft, On those rich plains, the precious home they left. More poignant grief see generous Mencia feel, More noble proof she gives of patriot zeal: Waving a sword in her heroic hand, In their tame march she stopt the timid band; Cross'd the ascending road before their van, And, turning to the city, thus began: Thou valiant nation, whose unequall'd toils Have dearly purchas'd fame and golden spoils, Where is the courage ye so oft display'd Against this foe, from whom ye shrink dismay'd? Where those high hopes, and that aspiring flame, Which made immortal praise your constant aim? Where your firm souls, that every chance defied, And native strength, that form'd your noble pride? Ah whither would you fly, in selfish fear, In frantic haste, with no pursuer near? How oft has censure to your hearts assign'd Ardor too keenly brave and rashly blind; Eager to dart amid the doubtful fray, Scorning the useful aid of wise delay? Have we not seen you with contempt oppose, And bend beneath your yoke unnumber'd foes; Attempt and execute designs so bold, Ye grew immortal as ye heard them told? Turn! to your people turn a pitying eye, To whom your fears these happy seats deny! Turn! and survey this fair this fertile land, Whose ready tribute waits your lordly hand; Survey its pregnant mines, its sands of gold; Survey the flock now wandering from its fold, Mark how it vainly seeks, in wild despair, The faithless shepherd, who forsakes his care. E'en the dumb creatures of domestic kind, Though not endow'd with man's discerning mind, Now shew the semblance of a reasoning soul, And in their masters' misery condole: The stronger animals, of sterner heart, Take in this public woe a feeling part; Their plantive roar, that speaks their sense aright, Justly upbraids your ignominious flight. Ye fly from quiet, opulence, and fame, Purchas'd by valour, your acknowledg'd claim; From these ye fly, to seek a foreign seat, Where dastard fugitives no welcome meet. How deep the shame, an abject life to spend In poor dependance on a pitying friend! Turn!—let the brave their only choice await, Or honourable life, or instant fate. Return! return! O quit this path of shame! Stain not by fear your yet unsullied name; Myself I offer, if our foes advance, To rush the foremost on the hostile lance; My actions then shall with my words agree, And what a woman dares your eyes shall see. Return! return! she cried; but cried in vain; Her fire seem'd frenzy to the coward train. CANTO IX. When to the city's weak defenceless wall Its foes were rushing, at their trumpet's call, The air grew troubled with portentous sound, And mournful omens multiplied around; With furious shock the elements engage, And all the winds contend in all their rage. From clashing clouds their mingled torrents gush, And rain and hail with rival fury rush. Bolts of loud thunder, floods of lightning rend The opening skies, and into earth descend. O'er the vast army equal terrors spread; No mind escapes the universal dread; No breast, tho' arm'd with adamantine power, Holds its firm vigour in this horrid hour; For now the fierce Eponamon appears, And in a Dragon's form augments their fears; Involving flames around the Dæmon swell, Who speaks his mandate in a hideous yell: He bids his votaries with haste invest The trembling city, by despair deprest. Where'er th' invading squadrons force their way, He promises their arms an easy prey. Spare not (he cry'd) in the relentless strife, One Spanish battlement, one Christian life! He spoke, and, while the host his will adore, Melts into vapour, and is seen no more. Quick as he vanish'd Nature's struggles cease; The troubled elements are sooth'd to peace: The winds no longer rage with boundless ire, But, hush'd in silence, to their caves retire: The clouds disperse, restoring as they fly The unobstructed sun and azure sky: Fear only held its place, and still possest Usurp'd dominion o'er the boldest breast. The tempest ceas'd, and heaven, serenely bright, Array'd the moisten'd earth in joyous light: When, pois'd upon a cloud that swiftly flew, A Female form descended to their view, Clad in the radiance of so rich a veil, As made the sun's meridian lustre pale; For it outshone his golden orb as far As his full blaze outshines the twinkling star. Her sacred features banish all their dread, And o'er the host reviving comfort shed. An hoary Elder by her side appear'd, For age and sanctity of life rever'd; And thus she spoke, with soft persuasive grace: Ah! whither rush ye, blind devoted race? Turn, while you can, towards your native plain, Nor 'gainst yon city point your arms in vain; For God will guard his faithful Christian band, And give them empire o'er your bleeding land, Since, thankless, false, and obstinate in ill, You scorn submission to his sacred will. Yet shun those walls; th' Almighty, there ador'd, There arms his people with Destruction's sword. So spoke the Vision, with an angel's tongue, And thro' the spacious air to heaven she sprung. CANTO XII. What can redeem Lautaro's wounded name? What plea preserve his failing arms from shame? Did not my ardent soul this task demand, Which now upbraids my unperforming hand? On me, on me alone can censure fall; Myself th' adviser and the guide of all. Am I the Chief who, in Fame's bright career, Ask'd to subdue the globe a single year? While, at the head of this my glittering train, I weakly threaten Spanish walls in vain, Thrice has pale Cynthia, with replenish'd ray, Seen my ill-order'd troop in loose array; And the rich chariot of the blazing sun Has from the Scorpion to Aquarius run. At last, as fugitives these paths we tread, And mourn twice fifty brave companions dead. Could Fate's kind hand this hateful stain efface, Could death redeem me from this worse disgrace, My useless spear should pierce this abject heart, Which has so ill sustain'd a soldier's part. Unworthy thought! the mean, ignoble blow Would only tempt my proud and vaunting foe To boast that I preferr'd, in fear's alarm, My own weak weapon to his stronger arm. By Hell I swear, who rules the sanguine strife, If Chance allow me yet a year of life, I'll chase these foreign lords from Chile's strand, And Spanish blood shall saturate our land. No changing season, neither cold nor heat, Shall make the firmer step of War retreat; Nor shall the earth, nor hell's expanding cave, From this avenging arm one Spaniard save. Now the brave Chief, with solemnardour, swore To his dear native home to turn no more; From no fierce sun, no stormy winds to fly, But patiently abide the varying sky, And spurn all thoughts of pleasure and of ease, Till rescu'd fame his tortur'd soul appease; Till earth confess the brave Lautaro's hand Has clos'd the glorious work his spirit plann'd. In these resolves the Hero found relief, And thus relax'd the o'erstrain'd cord of grief; Whose pressure gall'd him with such mental pain, That frenzy almost seiz'd his burning brain. CANTO XIII. A path where watchful centinels were spread, A single path, to this lone station led: No other signs of human step were trac'd; For the vex'd land was desolate and waste. It chanc'd that night the noble Chieftain prest His anxious mistress to his gallant breast, The fair Guacolda, for whose charms he burn'd, And whose warm heart his faithful love return'd. That night beheld the warlike savage rest, Free from th' incumbrance of his martial vest; That night alone allow'd his eyes to close In the deceitful calm of short repose: Sleep prest upon him like the weight of death; But soon he starts, alarm'd, and gasps for breath. The fair Guacolda, with a trembling tongue, Anxious enquires from whence his anguish sprung. My lovely Fair! the brave Lautaro cries, An hideous vision struck my scornful eyes: Methought that instant a fierce Chief of Spain Mock'd my vain spear with insolent disdain; His forceful arm my failing powers o'ercame, And strength and motion seem'd to quit my frame. But still the vigour of my soul I keep, And its keen anger burst the bonds of sleep. With quick despair, the troubled Fair one said, Alas! thy dreams confirm the ills I dread. 'Tis come—the object of my boding fears! Thy end, the source of my unceasing tears. Yet not so wretched is this mournful hour, Nor o'er me, Fortune, canst thou boast such pow'r, But that kind death may shorten all my woes, And give the agonizing scene to close. Let my stern fate its cruel rage employ, And hurl me from the throne of love and joy; Whatever pangs its malice may devise, It cannot rend affection's stronger ties. Tho' horrible the blow my fears foresee, A second blow will set my spirit free; For cold on earth thy frame shall ne'er be found, While mine with useless being loads the ground. The Chief, transported with her tender charms, Closely around her neck entwin'd his arms; And, while fond tears her snowy breast bedew'd, Thus with redoubled love his speech pursu'd: My generous Fair, thy gloomy thoughts dismiss; Nor let dark omens interrupt our bliss, And cloud these moments that with transport shine, While my exulting heart thus feels thee mine. Thy troubled fancy prompts my mutual sigh; Not that I think the hour of danger nigh: But Love so melts me with his soft controul, Impossibilities alarm my soul. If thy kind wishes bid Lautaro live, Who to this frame the wound of death can give? Tho' 'gainst me all the powers of earth combine, My life is subject to no hand but thine. Who has restor'd the Araucanian name, And rais'd it, sinking in the depths of shame, When alien lords our nation's spirit broke, And bent its neck beneath a servile yoke? I am the Chief who burst our galling chain, And freed my country from oppressive Spain; My name alone, without my sword's display, Humbles our foes, and fills them with dismay. These happy arms while thy dear beauties fill, I feel no terror, I foresee no ill. Be not by false and empty dreams deprest, Since truth has nothing to afflict thy breast. Oft have I 'scap'd, inur'd to every state, From many a darker precipice of fate; Oft in far mightier perils risk'd my life, And issued glorious from the doubtful strife. With less'ning confidence, and deeper grief, Trembling she hung upon the soothing Chief, His lip with supplicating softness prest, And urg'd with many a tear this fond request: If the pure love, which, prodigal and free, When freedom most was mine, I gave to thee; If truth, which Heaven will witness and defend, Weigh with my sovereign lord and gentle friend; By these let me adjure thee; by the pain Which at our parting pierc'd my every vein, And all the vows, if undispers'd in air, Which then with many a tear I heard thee swear; To this my only wish at least agree, If all thy wishes have been laws to me: Haste, I entreat thee, arm thyself with care, And bid thy soldiers for defence prepare. The brave Barbarian quick reply'd—'Tis clear How low my powers are rated by thy fear. Canst thou so poorly of Lautaro deem? And is this arm so sunk in thy esteem? This arm, which, rescuing thy native earth, So prodigally prov'd its valiant worth! In my try'd courage how complete thy trust, Whose terror weeps thy living lord as dust! In thee, she cries, with confidence most pure, My soul is satisfy'd, yet not secure. What will thy arm avail in danger's course, If my malignant fate has mightier force? But let the mis'ry I forebode arise; On this firm thought my constant love relies: The sword whose stroke our union may disjoin, Will teach my faithful soul to follow thine. Since my hard destiny, with rage severe, Thus threatens me with all that love can fear; Since I am doom'd the worst of ills to see, And lose all earthly good in losing thee; O! suffer me to pass, ere death appears, The little remnant of my life in tears! The heart that sinks not in distress like this, Could never feel, could never merit bliss. Here from her eyes such floods of sorrow flow, Compassion weeps in gazing on her woe! The fond Lautaro, tho' of firmest power, Sheds, as she speaks, a sympathetic shower. But, to the tender scenes of love unus'd, My artless pen, embarrass'd and confus'd, From its sad task with diffidence withdraws, And in its labour asks a little pause. CANTO XIV. What erring wretch, to Truth and Beauty blind, Shall dare to satirize the Female Kind, Since pure affection prompts their anxious care, Their lovely weakness, and their fond despair? This fair Barbarian, free from Christian ties, A noble proof of perfect love supplies, By kindest words, and floods of tears that roll From the clear source of her impassion'd soul. The cheering ardour of the dauntless Chief Fails to afford her troubled mind relief; Nor can the ample trench and guarded wall Preserve her doubtful heart from fear's enthrall: Her terrors, rushing with love's mighty force, Level whatever would impede their course. She finds no shelter from her cruel doom, Save the dear refuge of Lautaro's tomb. Thus their two hearts, where equal passion reign'd, A fond debate with tender strife maintain'd; Their differing words alike their love display, Feed the sweet poison, and augment its sway. The sleepy soldiers now their stories close, And stretch'd around their sinking fires repose. The path in front with centinels was lin'd, And the high mountain was their guard behind; But o'er that mountain, with advent'rous tread, Bold Villagran his silent forces led. His hasty march with painful toil he made; Toil is the price that must for fame be paid. Now near the fort, and halting in its sight, He waits the coming aid of clearer light. The stars yet shining, but their fires decay, And now the reddening East proclaims the day. Th' advancing troop no Indian eye alarms, For friendly darkness hover'd o'er their arms; And on the quarter where the mountain rose, The careless guard despis'd the thought of foes. No panting horse their still approach betray'd; Propitious Fortune lent the Spaniards aid; Fortune, who oft bids drowsy Sloth beware, And lulls to sleep the watchful eye of Care. When Night's obscure dominion first declines, And glimmering light the dusky air refines, The weary guards, who round the wall were plac'd, Hail the new day, and from their station haste; Secure of ill, no longer watch they keep, Quick to forget their nightly toils in sleep: Thro' all the fort there reign'd a calm profound; In wine and slumber all its force was drown'd. The Spanish Chief, who saw the fav'ring hour, Led on by slow degrees his silent power. No Indian eyes perceiv'd his near advance; Fate seem'd to bind them in a cruel trance; Each in sound slumber draws his easy breath, Nor feels his slumber will be clos'd by Death. So blind are mortals to that tyrant's sway, They deem him distant, while they sink his prey. Our eager soldiers now no longer halt, While kind occasion prompts the keen assault; A shout they raise, terrific, loud, and long, Swell'd by the voice of all the ardent throng; Whose ranks, obedient to their Leader's call, Rush with light ardour o'er th' unguarded wall, And gain the fort, where Sleep's oppressive weight Expos'd his wretched victims, blind to fate. As villains, conscious of their life impure, Find in their guilty course no spot secure; For vice is ever doom'd new fears to feel, And tremble at each turn of Fortune's wheel; At every noise, at each alarm that stirs, Death's penal horror to their mind occurs; Quick to their arms they fly with wild dismay, And rush where hasty terror points the way: So quick the Indians to the tumult came, With sleep and valour struggling in their frame. Unaw'd by danger's unexpected sight, They rouse their fellows, and they rush to fight. Tho' their brave bosoms are of armour bare, Their manly hearts their martial rage declare. No furious odds their gallant souls appal, But resolute they fly to guard the wall. It was the season when, with tender care, Lautaro reason'd with his anxious Fair; Carest, consol'd, and, in his anger kind, Mildly reprov'd her weak, mistrusting mind. Spite of his cheering voice she trembles still; Severer terrors now her bosom fill: For sterner sounds their soft debate o'ercome, Drown'd in the rattle of th' alarming drum. But not so quick, on Apprehension's wings, The wretched miser from his pillow springs, Whose hoarded gold forbids his mind to rest, If doubtful noise the nightly thief suggest: Nor yet so hasty, tho' with terror wild, Flies the fond mother to her wounded child, Whose painful cry her shuddering soul alarms, As flew Lautaro at the sound of arms. His mantle rapidly around him roll'd, And, grasping a light sword with hasty hold, Too eager for his heavier arms to wait, The fierce Barbarian hurried to the gate. O faithless Fortune! thou deceitful friend! Of thy false favours how severe the end! How quick thou cancell'st, when thy frown appears, Th' accumulated gifts of long triumphant years! To aid the Spaniards in their bold emprize, Four hundred Indians march'd, their firm allies, Who on the left their line of battle close, And haste to combat with their painted bows; Launching adroitly, in their rapid course, Unnumber'd arrows with unerring force. As brave Lautaro issued from his tent, A shaft to meet the sallying Chief was sent; Thro' his left side (ye valiant, mourn his lot!) Flew the keen arrow, with such fury shot It pierc'd his heart, the bravest and the best That e'er was lodg'd within a human breast. Proud of the stroke that laid such valour low, Death seem'd to glory in th' important blow; And, that no Mortal might his triumph claim, In darkness hid the doubtful Archer's name. Such force the keen resistless weapon found, It stretch'd the mighty Chieftain on the ground, And gave large outlet to his ardent blood, That gush'd apace in a tumultuous flood. From his sunk cheek its native colour fled; His sightless eyes roll'd in his ghastly head; His soul, that felt its glorious hopes o'erthrown, Retir'd, indignant, to the world unknown. CANTO XX. While thus I strove my nightly watch to keep, And struggled with th' oppressive weight of sleep, As my quick feet, with many a silent stride, Travers'd th' allotted ground from side to side, My eye perceiv'd one quarter of the plain White with the mingled bodies of the slain; For our incessant fire, that bloody day, Had slaughter'd numbers in the stubborn fray. As oft I paus'd each distant noise to hear, Gazing around me with attentive ear, I heard from time to time a feeble sound Towards the breathless Indians on the ground, Still closing with a sigh of mournful length; At every interval it gather'd strength; And now it ceas'd, and now again begun, And still from corse to corse it seem'd to run. As night's encreasing shade my hope destroys, To view the source of this uncertain noise, Eager my mind's unquiet doubts to still, And more the duties of my post fulfil, With crouching steps I haste, and earnest eyes, To the low spot from whence the murmurs rise; And see a dusky Form, that seems to tread Slow, on four feet, among the gory dead. With terror, that my heart will not deny, When this strange vision struck my doubtful eye, Towards it, with a prayer to Heav'n, I prest, Arms in my hand, my corselet on my breast; But now the dusky Form, on which I sprung, Upright arose, and spoke with plaintive tongue: Mercy! to mercy hear my just pretence; I am a woman, guiltless of offence! If my distress, and unexampled plight, No generous pity in thy breast excite; If thy blood-thirsty rage, by tears uncheck'd, Would pass those limits which the brave respect; Will such a deed encrease thy martial fame, When Heaven's just voice shall to the world proclaim That by thy ruthless sword a woman died, A widow, sunk in sorrow's deepest tide? Yet I implore thee, if 'twas haply thine, Or for thy curse, as now I feel it mine; If e'er thy lot, in any state, to prove How firm the faithful ties of tender love, O let me bury one brave warrior slain, Whose corse lies blended with this breathless train! Remember, he who thwarts the duteous will Becomes th' approver and the cause of ill. Thou wilt not hinder these my pious vows; War fiercest war, this just demand allows: The basest tyranny alone is driven To use the utmost power that chance has given. Let but my soul its dear companion find, Then sate thy fury, if to blood inclin'd; For in such grief I draw my lingering breath, Life is my dread, beyond the pangs of death. There is no ill that now can wound my breast, No good, but what I in my Love possest: Fly then, ye hours! that keep me from the dead; For he, the spirit of my life, is fled. If adverse Heaven my latest wish deny, On his dear corse to fix my closing eye, My tortur'd soul, in cruel Fate's despight, Will soar, the faithful partner of his flight. And now her agony of heart implor'd An end of all her sorrows from my sword. Doubt and distrust my troubled mind assail, That fears deceit in her affecting tale; Nor was I fully of her faith secure, Till oft her words the mournful truth insure; Suspicion whisper'd, that an artful spy By this illusion might our state descry. Howe'er inclin'd to doubt, yet soon I knew, Though night conceal'd her features from my view, That truth was stamp'd on every word she said; So full of grief, so free from guilty dread: And that bold love, to every danger blind, Had sent her forth her slaughter'd Lord to find, Who, in the onset of our bloody strife, For brave distinction sacrific'd his life. Fill'd with compassion, when I saw her bent To execute her chaste and fond intent, I led her weeping to the higher spot, To guard whose precincts was that night my lot; Securely there I begg'd her to relate The perfect story of her various fate; From first to last her touching woes impart, And by the tale relieve her loaded heart. Ah! she replied, relief I ne'er can know, Till Death's kind aid shall terminate my woe! Earth for my ills no remedy supplies, Beyond all suff'rance my afflictions rise: Yet, though the task will agonize my soul, Of my sad story I will tell the whole; Grief, thus infore'd, my life's weak thread may rend, And in the killing tale my pangs may end. CANTO XXI. In pure affection who has soar'd above The tender pious proof of faithful love, Which thus awak'd our sympathetic care For this unhappy, fond, barbarian Fair? O that just Fame my humble voice would raise To swell in loudest notes her lasting praise! To spread her merits, in immortal rhyme, Through every language, and through every clime! With pitying females she the night remain'd, Where no rude step their privacy profan'd; Though wretched, thankful for their soothing aid, With hopes her duty would at length be paid. Soon as the welcome light of morning came, Though soundest sleep had seiz'd my jaded frame, Though my tir'd limbs were still to rest inclin'd, Solicitude awak'd my anxious mind. Quick to my Indian Mourner I repair, And still in tears I find the restless Fair; The varying hours afford her no relief, No transient momentary pause of grief. With truest pity I her pangs assuage; To find her slaughter'd Lord my word engage, Restore his corse, and, with a martial band, Escort her safely to her native land. With blended doubt and sorrow, weeping still, My promis'd word she pray'd me to fulfil. Assembling now a menial Indian train, I led her to explore the bloody plain: Where heaps of mingled dead deform'd the ground, Near to the fort the breathless Chief we found; Clay-cold and stiff, the gory earth he prest, A fatal ball had pass'd his manly breast. Wretched Tegualda, who before her view'd The pale disfigur'd form, in blood imbru'd, Sprung forward, and with instantaneous force Frantic she darted on the precious corse, And press'd his lips, where livid death appears, And bath'd his wounded bosom in her tears, And kiss'd the wound, and the wild hope pursues That her fond breath may yet new life infuse. Wretch that I am! at length she madly cried, Why does my soul these agonies abide? Why do I linger in this mortal strife, Nor pay to Love his just demand, my life? Why, poor of spirit! at a single blow Do I not close this bitter scene of woe? Whence this delay? will Heaven to me deny The wretch's choice and privilege, to die? While, bent on death, in this despair she gasp'd, Her furious hands her snowy neck inclasp'd; Failing her frantic wish, they do not spare Her mournful visage nor her flowing hair. Much as I strove to stop her mad intent, Her fatal purpose I could scarce prevent: So loath'd she life, and with such fierce controul The raging thirst of death inflam'd her soul. When by my prayers, and soft persuasion's balm, Her pangs of sorrow grew a little calm, And her mild speech confirm'd my hope, at last, That her delirious agony was past, My ready Indian train, with duteous haste, On a firm bier the clay-cold body plac'd, And bore the Warrior, in whose fate we griev'd, To where her vassals the dear charge receiv'd. But, lest from ruthless War's outrageous sway The mourning Fair might suffer on her way, O'er the near mountains, to a safer land, I march'd to guard her with my warlike band; And there secure, for the remaining road Was clear and open to her own abode, She gratefully declin'd my farther care, And thank'd and bless'd me in a parting prayer. CANTO XXXIII. With their accustom'd shouts, and greedy toil, Our furious troops now riot in their spoil; Through the lone village their quick rapine spread, Nor leave unpillag'd e'en a single shed: When, from a tent, that, plac'd on safer ground, The neighbouring hill's uncultur'd summit crown'd, A woman rush'd, who, in her hasty flight, Ran through the roughest paths along the rocky height. A Negro of our train, who mark'd her way, Soon made the hapless fugitive his prey; For thwarting crags her doubtful steps impede, And the fair form was ill prepar'd for speed; For at her breast she bore her huddled son; To fifteen months the infant's life had run: From our brave captive sprung the blooming boy, Of both his parents the chief pride and joy. The Negro carelessly his victim brought, Nor knew th' important prize his haste had caught, Our soldiers now, to catch the cooling tide, Had sallied to the murmuring river's side: When the unhappy Wife beheld her Lord, His strong arms bound with a disgraceful cord, Stript of each ensign of his past command, And led the pris'ner of our shouting band; Her anguish burst not into vain complaint, No female terrors her firm soul attaint; But, breathing fierce disdain, and anger wild, Thus she exclaim'd, advancing with her child: The stronger arm that in this shameful band Has tied thy weak effeminated hand, Had nobler pity to thy state exprest If it had bravely pierc'd that coward breast. Wert thou the Warrior whose heroic worth So swiftly flew around the spacious earth, Whose name alone, unaided by thy arm, Shook the remotest clime with fear's alarm? Wert thou the Victor whose triumphant strain Promis'd with rapid sword to vanquish Spain; To make new realms Arauco's power revere, And spread her empire o'er the Arctic sphere? Wretch that I am! how was my heart deceiv'd, In all the noble pride with which it heav'd, When through the world my boasted title ran, Tresia, the wife of great Caupolican! Now, plung'd in misery from the heights of fame, My glories end in this detested shame, To see thee captive in a lonely spot, When death and honour might have been thy lot! What now avail thy scenes of happier strife, So dearly bought by many a nobler life; The wondrous feats, that valour scarce believ'd, By thee with hazard and with toil atchiev'd? Where are the vaunted fruits of thy command, The laurels gather'd by this fetter'd hand? All sunk! all turn'd to this abhorr'd disgrace, To live the slave of this ignoble race! Say, had thy soul no strength, thy hand no lance, To triumph o'er the fickle pow'r of chance? Dost thou not know, that, to the Warrior's name, A gallant exit gives immortal fame? Behold the burthen which my breast contains, Since of thy love no other pledge remains! Hadst thou in glory's arms resign'd thy breath, We both had follow'd thee in joyous death: Take, take thy Son! he was a tie most dear, Which spotless love once made my heart revere; Take him!—by generous pain, and wounded pride, The currents of this fruitful breast are dried; Rear him thyself, for thy gigantic frame, To woman turn'd, a woman's charge may claim: A mother's title I no more desire, Or shameful children from a shameful sire! As thus she spoke, with growing madness stung, The tender nursling from her arms she flung With savage fury, hast'ning from our sight, While anguish seem'd to aid her rapid flight. Vain were our efforts; our indignant cries, Nor gentle prayers, nor angry threats, suffice To make her breast, where cruel frenzy burn'd, Receive the little innocent she spurn'd. SONNET I. While on my head kind Fortune deign'd to pour Her lavish boons, and through my willing soul Made tides of extasy and pleasure roll, I sung the raptures of each passing hour. But Love, who heard me praise the golden shower, Resolv'd my fond presumption to controul; And painful darkness o'er my spirit stole, Lest I should dare to tell his treacherous power. O ye, whom his hard yoke compels to bend To others' will, if in my various lay Sad plaints ye find, and fears, and cruel wrong, To suffering nature and to truth attend; For in the measure ye have felt his sway, Your sympathizing hearts will feel my song. SONNET XIX. ON THE DEATH OF THE POET'S MISTRESS, DONNA CATALINA DE ATAIDE, WHO DIED AT THE AGE OF TWENTY. Go, gentle spirit! now supremely blest, From scenes of pain and struggling virtue go: From thy immortal seat of heavenly rest Behold us lingering in a world of woe! And if beyond the grave, to saints above, Fond memory still the transient past pourtrays, Blame not the ardour of my constant love, Which in these longing eyes was wont to blaze. But if from virtue's source my sorrows rise, For the sad loss I never can repair, Be thine to justify my endless sighs, And to the Throne of Grace prefer thy prayer, That Heaven, who made thy span of life so brief, May shorten mine, and give my soul relief. SONNET LXXII. While prest with woes from which it cannot flee, My fancy sinks, and slumber seals my eyes, Her spirit hastens in my dreams to rise, Who was in life but as a dream to me. O'er a drear waste, so wide no eye can see How far its sense-evading limit lies, I follow her quick step; but ah! she flies! Our distance widening by stern Fate's decree. Fly not from me, kind shadow! I exclaim: She, with fix'd eyes, that her soft thoughts reveal, And seem to say, “Forbear thy fond design!” Still flies:—I call her; but her half-form'd name Dies on my falt'ring tongue.—I wake, and seel Not e'en one short delusion may be mine. TRANSLATION'S TAKEN FROM THE NOTES TO THE FOURTH EPISTLE OF AN ESSAY ON EPIC POETRY THE SONNET OF GIUSTINA TO PETRARCH. Gladly would I exchange inglorious ease For future fame, the Poet's fond desire! And still to live, in spite of death, aspire By Virtue's light, that darkness cannot seize: But, stupified by Custom's blank decrees, The idle vulgar, void of liberal fire, Bid me, with scorn, from Helicon retire, And rudely blame my generous hope to please. Distaffs, not laurels, to your sex belong, They cry—as honour were beyond our view: To such low cares they wish my spirit bent. Say thou! who marchest, mid the favour'd few, To high Parnassus, with triumphant song, Should I abandon such a fair intent? THE ANSWER OF PETRARCH. Luxurious pleasure, and lethargic ease, Have deaden'd in the world each bright desire: Our thoughts no more with Nature's force aspire; Custom's cold powers the drooping fancy seize: So lost each light that taught the soul to please, Each heavenly spark of life-directing fire, That all, who join the Heliconian choir, Are frantic deem'd by Folly's dull decrees. What charms, what worth to Laurel-wreaths belong? Naked and poor Philosophy we view, Exclaims the crowd, on sordid gain intent.— Associates in thy path thou'lt find but few; The more I pray thee, Nymph of graceful song, Indulge thy spirit in its noble bent!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. V. THE TRIUMPHS OF TEMPER; A POEM: IN SIX CANTOS. O VOI CH' AVETE GL' INTELLETTI SANI MIRATE LA DOTTRINA, CHE SI ASCONDE SOTTO' IL VELAME DEGLI VERSI STRANI. Dante, Inferno, Canto 9. PREFACE. It seems to be a kind of duty incumbent on those who devote themselves to Poetry, to raise, if possible, the dignity of a declining Art, by making it as beneficial to Life and Manners as the limits of Composition, and the character of modern Times, will allow. The ages, indeed, are past, in which the song of the Poet was idolized for its miraculous effects; yet a Poem, intended to promote the cultivation of good-humour, may still perhaps be fortunate enough to prove of some little service to society in general; or, if this idea may be thought too chimerical and romantic by sober Reason, it is at least one of those pleasing and innocent delusions, in which a poetical Enthusiast may be safely indulged. The following production owes its existence to an incident in real life, very similar to the principal action of the last Canto; but in forming the general plan of the work, it seemed to me absolutely necessary to introduce both the agency and the abode of SPLEEN, notwithstanding the difficulty and the hazard of attempting a subject so happily executed by the masterly pencil of Pope. I considered his Cave of Spleen as a most exquisite cabinet picture; and, to avoid the servility of imitation, I determined to sketch the mansion of this gloomy Power on a much wider canvass: Happy, indeed, if the judgment of the Public may enable me to exclaim, with the honest vanity of the Painter, who compared his own works to the divine productions of Raphael, “E son Pittore anch' Io!” The celebrated Alessandro Tassoni, who is generally considered as the inventor of the modern Heroi-comic Poetry, was so proud of having extended the limits of his art by a new kind of composition, that he not only spoke of it with infinite exultation in one of his private letters, but even gave a MS. copy of his work to his native city of Modena, with an inscription, in which he stiled it a new species of Poetry, invented by himself. A few partial friends have asserted, that the present performance has some degree of similar merit; but as I apprehend all the novelty it possesses, may rather require an apology, than entitle its Author to challenge commendation, I shall explain how far the conduct of the Poem differs from the most approved models in this mode of writing, and slightly mention the poetical effects, which such a variation appeared likely to produce. It is well known, that the favourite Poems, which blend the serious and the comic, represent their principal characters in a satirical point of view: It was the intention of Tassoni (though prudence made him attempt to conceal it) to satirize a particular Italian Nobleman, who happened to be the object of his resentment. Boileau openly ridicules the French Ecclesiastics in his Lutrin; Garth, our English Physicians, in his Dispensary; and the Rape of the Lock itself, that most excellent and enchanting Poem, which I never contemplate but with new idolatry, is denominated the best Satire extant, by the learned Dr. Warton, in his very elegant and ingenious, but severe, Essay on Pope: A sentence which seems to be confirmed by the Poet himself, in his letter to Mrs. Fermor, where he says, “the character of Belinda, as it is now managed, resembles you in nothing but in beauty.” Though I think, that no composition can surpass, or perhaps ever equal this most happy effort of Genius, as a sportive Satire, I imagined it might be possible to give a new Character to this mixed species of Poetry, and to render it by its Object, though not in its Execution, more noble than the most beautiful and refined Satire can be. We have seen it carried to inimitable perfection, in the most delicate raillery on Female Foibles:—It remained to be tried, if it might not also aspire to delineate the more engaging features of Female Excellence. The idea appeared to me worth the experiment; for, if it succeeded, it seemed to promise a double advantage; first, it would give an air of novelty to the Poem; and, secondly, what I thought of much greater importance, it would render it more interesting to the heart. On these principles, I have endeavoured to paint Serena as a most lovely, engaging, and accomplished character; yet I hope the colouring is so faithfully copied from general Nature, that every man, who reads the Poem, may be happy enough to know many Fair ones, who resemble my Heroine. There is another point, in which I have also attempted to give this Poem an air of novelty: I mean, the manner of connecting the real and the visionary scenes, which compose it; by shifting these in alternate Cantos, I hoped to make familiar Incident and allegorical Picture afford a strong relief to each other, and keep the attention of the Reader alive, by an appearance particularly diversified. I wished, indeed (but I fear most ineffectually) for powers to unite some touches of the sportive wildness of Ariosto, and the more serious sublime painting of Dante, with some portion of the enchanting elegance, the refined imagination, and the moral graces of Pope; and to do this, if possible, with-out violating those rules of propriety, which Mr. Cambridge has illustrated, by example as well as precept, in the Scribleriad, and in his sensible Preface to that elegant and learned Poem. I have now very frankly informed my Reader of the extent, or rather the extravagance of my desire; for I will not give it the serious name of design: They, whom an enlightened taste has rendered thoroughly sensible how very difficult it must be to accomplish such an idea, will not only be the first to discern, but the most ready to pardon those errors, into which so hazardous an attempt may perhaps have betrayed me. I had thoughts of introducing this performance to the Public, by a Dissertation of considerable length on this species of Poetry; but I forbear to indulge myself any farther in such preliminary remarks, as the anxiety of authors is so apt to produce, from the reflection, that, however ingeniously written, they add little or nothing to the success of a good Poem, and are utterly insufficient to prevent that neglect, or oblivion, which is the inevitable fate of a bad one. In dismissing a work to my Fair Readers, which is intended principally for their perusal, I shall only recommend it to their attention; and bid them farewell, in the words of the pleasant and courteous Tassoni— “Vaglia il buon voler, s' altro non lice, “E chi la leggera, viva felice!” Eartham Jan. 31, 1781. CANTO I. The mind's soft guardian, who, tho' yet unsung, Inspires with harmony the female tongue, And gives, improving every tender grace, The smile of angels to a mortal face; Her powers I sing; and scenes of mental strife, Which form the maiden for th' accomplish'd wife; Where the sweet victor sees, with sparkling eyes, Love her reward, and happiness her prize. Daughters of beauty, who the song inspire, To your enchanting notes attune my lyre! And O! if haply your soft hearts may gain Or use, or pleasure from the motley strain, Tho' formal critics, with a surly frown, Deny your artless bard the laurel crown, He still shall triumph, if ye deign to spread Your sweeter myrtle round his honour'd head. In your bright circle young Serena grew; A lovelier nymph the pencil never drew; For the fond Graces form'd her easy mien, And heaven's soft azure in her eye was seen. She seem'd a rose-bud, when it first receives The genial sun in its expanding leaves: For now she enter'd those important years, When the full bosom swells with hopes and fears; When conscious nature prompts the secret sigh, And sheds sweet languor o'er the melting eye; When nobler toys the female heart trepan, And dolls rejected, yield their place to man. Beneath a father's care Serena grew; The good Sir Gilbert, to his country true, A faithful Whig, who, zealous for the state, In freedom's service led the loud debate; Yet every day, by transmutation rare, Turn'd to a Tory in his elbow-chair, And made his daughter pay, howe'er absurd, Passive obedience to his sovereign word. In his domestic sway he borrow'd aid From prim Penelope, an ancient maid, His upright sister, conscious of her worth, Who valued still her beauty, and her birth; Tho' from her birth no envied rank she gain'd, And of her beauty but the ghost remain'd; A restless ghost! that with remembrance keen Proclaim'd incessant what it once had been; Delighted still the steps of youth to haunt, To watch the tender nymph, and warm gallant; And, with an eye that petrified pursuit, Hang like the dragon o'er th' Hesperian fruit. Tho' strictly guarded by this jealous power, The mild Serena no restraint could sour: Pure was her bosom, as the silver lake, Ere rising winds the ruffled water shake, When the bright pageants of the morning sky, Across th' expansive mirror lightly fly, By vernal gales in quick succession driven, While the clear glass reflects the smile of heaven. In gay content a sportive life she led, The child of Modesty, by Virtue bred: Her light companions Innocence and Ease: Her hope was pleasure, and her wish to please: For this, to Fashion early rites she paid; For this, to Venus secret vows she made; Nor held it sin to cast a private glance O'er the dear pages of a new romance, Eager in fiction's touching scenes to find A field to exercise her youthful mind: The touching scenes new energy imprest On all the virtues of her feeling breast. Sweet Evelina's fascinating power Had first beguil'd of sleep her midnight hour: Possest by sympathy's enchanting sway, She read, unconscious of the dawning day. The Modern Anecdote was next convey'd Beneath her pillow by her faithful maid. The nymph, attentive as the brooding dove, Por'd o'er the tender scenes of Franzel's love: The sinking taper now grew weak and pale; Serena sigh'd, and dropt th' unfinish'd tale; But, as warm clouds in vernal æther roll, The soft ideas floated in her soul: Free from ambitious pride, and envious care, To love, and to be lov'd, was all her prayer: While these fond thoughts her gentle mind possess'd, Soft slumber settled on her snowy breast. Scarce had her radiant eyes began to close, When to her view a friendly vision rose: A fairy Phantom struck her mental sight, Light as the gossamer, as æther bright; Array'd like Pallas was the pigmy form, When the sage Goddess stills the martial storm. Her casque was amber, richly grac'd above With down, collected from the callow dove: Her burnish'd breast-plate, of a deeper dye, Was once the armour of a golden fly: A lynx's eye her little ægis shone, By fairy spells converted into stone, And worn of old, as elfin poets sing, By Ægypt's lovely queen, a favourite ring: Mysterious power was in the magic toy, To turn the frowns of care to smiles of joy. Her tiny lance, whose radiance stream'd afar, Was one bright sparkle from the bridal star. A filmy mantle round her figure play'd, Fine as the texture, by Arachne laid O'er some young plant, when glittering to the view With many an orient pearl of morning dew. The Phantom hover'd o'er the conscious Fair With such a lively smile of tender care, As on her elsin lord Titania cast, When first she found his angry spell was past. Round her rich locks Serena chanc'd to tie An ample ribband of cærulean dye: High o'er her forehead rose the graceful bow, Whose arch commanded the sweet scene below: The hovering Spirit view'd the tempting spot, And lightly perch'd on this unbending knot; As the fair flutterer, of Psyche's race, Is seen to terminate her airy chace, When, pleas'd at length her quivering wings to close, Fondly she settles on the fragrant rose. Now in soft notes, more musically clear Than ever Fairy breath'd in mortal car, These words the visionary voice convey'd To the charm'd spirit of the sleeping maid: “Thou darling of my care, whose ripen'd worth Shall spread my empire o'er the smiling earth; Whom Nature blest, forbidding modish Art To cramp thy spirit, or contract thy heart; Screen'd from thy thought, nor in thy visions felt, Long on thy opening mind I've fondly dwelt; In childhood's sorrows brought thee quick relief, And dry'd thy April showers of infant grief; Taught thee to laugh at the malicious boy, Who broke thy playthings with a barbarous joy, To bear what ills the little female haunt, The testy nurse, th' imperious governante, And that tyrannic pest, the prying maiden aunt. Now ripening years a nobler scene supply; For life now opens on thy sparkling eye: Thy rising bosom swells with just desire Rapture to feel, and rapture to inspire: Not the vain bliss, the transitory joys, That childish woman feels, in radiant toys; The costly diamond, or the lighter pearl, The massive Nabob, or the tinsel Earl. Thy heart demands, each meaner aim above, Th' imperishable wealth of sterling love; Thy wish, to please by ev'ry softer grace Of elegance and ease, of form and face! By lively fancy and by sense refin'd, The stronger magic of the cultur'd mind! Thy pure ambition, and thy virtuous plan, To fix the variable heart of man! Short is the worship paid at beauty's shrine; But lasting love and happiness are mine: Mine, tho' the earth's mistaken, blinded race Despise my influence, and my name debase; Nor breathe one vow to that ætherial friend, On whom the colours of their life depend. But to thy innocence I'll now display The mystic marvels of my secret sway; And tell, in this thy fate-deciding hour, My race, my name, my office, and my power. First, hear what wonders human forms contain! And learn the texture of the female brain! By Nature's care in curious order spread, This living net is fram'd of tender thread; Fine, as thy hand, some favour'd youth to grace, Knits with nice art to form the mimic lace. Within the center of this fretted dome, Her secret tower, her heaven-constructed home, Soft Sensibility, sweet Beauty's soul! Keeps her coy state, and animates the whole, Invisible as Harmony, who springs, Wak'd by young Zephyr, from Æolian strings: Her subtle power, more delicately fine, Dwells in each thread, and lives in every line, Whose quick vibrations, without end, impart Pleasure and pain to the responsive heart. As Zephyr's breath the willing chord inspires, Whispering soft music to the trembling wires, So with fond care I regulate, unseen, The softer movements of this nice machine; Temper my earthly name, the nurse of Love! But call'd Sophrosyne in realms above! When lovely Woman, perfect at her birth, Blest with her early charms the wond'ring earth, Her soul, in sweet simplicity array'd, Nor shar'd my guidance, nor requir'd my aid. Her tender frame, nor confident nor coy, Had every fibre tun'd to gentle joy: No vain caprices swell'd her pouting lip; No gold produc'd a mercenary trip; Soft innocence inspir'd her willing kiss, Her love was nature, and her life was bliss. Guide of his reason, not his passion's prey, She tam'd the savage, Man, who bless'd her sway. No jarring wishes fill'd the world with woes, But youth was ecstacy, and age repose. The Powers of Mischief met, in dark Divan, To blast these mighty joys of envied Man: The Fiends, at their infernal leader's call, Fram'd their base wiles in Demogorgon's hall. In the deep center of that dreadful dome, An hellish cauldron boil'd with fiery foam: In this wide urn the circling spirits threw Ingredients harsh, and hideous to the view; While the terrific master of the spell With adjurations shook the depths of hell, And in dark words, unmeet for mortal ear, Bade the dire offspring of his art appear. Forth from the vase, with sullen murmurs, broke A towering mass of pestilential smoke: Emerging from this fog of thickest night, A Phantom swells, by slow degrees, to sight; But ere the view can seize the forming shape, From the mock'd eye its lineaments escape: It seem'd all passions melted into one, Assum'd the face of all, and yet was none: Hell stood aghast at its portentous mien, And shuddering Demons call'd the spectre Spleen. ‘Hie thee to earth!’ its mighty master cried, ‘O'er the vex'd globe in heavy vapours ride! Within its center fix thy shadowy throne! With shades thy subjects, and that hell thy own! Reign there unseen! but let thy strong controul Be hourly felt in Woman's wayward soul! With darkest poisons from our deep abyss, Taint that pure fountain of terrestrial bliss!’ Th' enormous Phantom, at this potent sound, Roll'd forth obedient from the vast profound: The quaking Fiends recover'd from their dread, And hell grew lighter, as the monster fled. But now round earth the gliding vapours run, Blot the rich æther, and eclipse the sun; All Nature sickens; and her fairest flower, Enchanting Woman, feels the baneful Power: As in her soul the clouds of Spleen arise, The sprightly essence of her beauty flies: In youth's gay prime, in hours with rapture warm, Love looks astonish'd on her altering form: To pleasing frolics, and enchanting wiles, Life-darting looks, and soul-subduing smiles, Dark whims succeed: thick-coming fancies fret; The sullen passion, and the hasty pet: The swelling lip, the tear-distended eye, The peevish question, the perverse reply; The moody humour, that, like rain and fire, Blends cold disgust with unsubdu'd desire, Flies what it loves, and, petulantly coy, Feigns proud abhorrence of the proffer'd joy: For Nature's artless aim, the wish to please By genuine modesty, and simple ease, Fashion's pert tricks the crowded brain oppress With all the poor parade of tawdry dress: The sickly bosom pants for noise and show, For every bauble, and for every beau; The voice, that health made harmony, disowns That native charm for languor's mimic tones; And feigns disease, till, feeling what it feigns, Its fancied maladies are real pains. Such, and a thousand still superior woes, From Spleen's new empire o'er the earth arose: Each simple dictate of the soul forgot, Then first was form'd the mercenary plot; And beauty practis'd that pernicious art, The art of angling for an old man's heart; Tho' crawling to his bride with tottering knees, His words were dotage, and his love disease. From sex to sex this base contagion ran, And gold grew beauty in the eyes of man: Courtship was traffic: and the married life But one loud jangle of incessant strife. The gentle Sprite, who, on his radiant car, Shines the mild regent of the evening-star, And joys from thence those genial rays to shed, That lead the bridegroom to the nuptial bed, While earth's new ills his friendly soul absorb, From Cynthia call'd me to his kindred orb; And, eager to redress the woes of man, The brilliant Son of Vesper thus began: ‘Thou softest Being of th' ætherial kind, Be thy benignant cares no more confin'd To smooth the ruffled plume of Zephyr's wing, To guard from cruel frost the infant spring, To drive gross atoms from the rays of noon, Or chase the halo from the vapourish moon! Thy friendly nature will not now deny To quit for noble toils thy native sky; Thou seest how Spleen's infernal vapours roll Across the sweet serene of woman's soul; And earth, which darkens as her beauties fade, Must grow a second hell without thy aid: Take then thy station! fix thy nobler reign O'er those fine chords, that form the female brain, That us'd, ere injur'd by the rust of Spleen, To fill with harmony the human scene! Go! lest her touch their tender tones destroy, Teach them to vibrate to thy notes of joy! Go! and restore, by stilling mental strife, Health to faint love, and happiness to life! So spake that friend of man, who lights above His heavenly lamp of Hymenæal love: In his just aim my kindred spirit join'd, And flew obedient to the charge assign'd. Hence, as the bias sways th' unconscious bowl, I long unseen have sway'd the careless soul; Tho' oft I feel my power by Spleen subdu'd, In the shrill vixen, and the sullen prude, In some fair forms my soft dominion grows, Like fragrance, rising from the opening rose: Still I preserve, in many a lovely face, That gay good-humour, and that constant grace, Which heavenly Powers united to infold In perfect Woman's new-created mould; When Nature, in her infant beauty blest, The last and loveliest of her works carest. But of those nymphs, who, delicately fair, Draw their soft graces from my forming care, My young Serena shines her peers above, Pride of my hopes, and darling of my love. Hence I to thee such mysteries unfold, As Man's pedantic eye shall ne'er behold; Whose narrow science, tho' it proudly boast To pierce the sky, and count the starry host, Sees not the lucid band of airy Powers, Who flutter round him in his secret hours: But if to me, thy guardian now display'd, Thy duteous orisons are justly paid, Thou to those realms shalt pass with me thy guide, Where Spleen's pale victims, after death, reside; Then to that orb, in vision shalt thou rise, Unseen by mortal astronomic eyes, Where I-but first let me thy soul prepare To meet our secret foe's insidious snare! 'Tis my fond purpose in thy form to show The sweetest model of my skill below: A youth I destine to thy dear embrace, Crown'd with each mental charm, and manly grace, With whom thy innocence, secure from strife, Shall reap the beauteous joys of blameless life. Pleas'd I observe thy little heart begin To ask, what charms the mighty prize may win: But know, tho' Elegance herself be seen To guide thy motion, and to form thy mien; Tho' Beauty o'er thy filial cheek diffuse The soft enchantment of her roseate hues, Not from their favour shall this glory rise! Temper shall singly gain the splendid prize: The sudden conquest shall be mine alone, And Love with transport shall my triumph own. Such are my hopes; but I with pain relate What hard conditions are annex'd by fate: As chemic fires, that patient labour blows, Draw the rich perfume from the Persian rose, So must thou form, by fiery toils refin'd, The living essence of thy sweeter mind. Dimly I see, on Destiny's dull glass, Three dangerous trials 'tis thy doom to pass; And oh! if once forgetful of my power, Good-humour fail thee in the fateful hour, Farewell those joys, that wait the happy wife! Farewell the vision of unclouded life! Fain would my love thy secret perils show, Which fate allows not even me to know: In Spleen's dark court a thousand agents dwell, Who bind her victims in the wayward spell; Perchance three prime supporters of her sway, The busiest of her fiends, may cross thy way: Stern Contradiction, her ill-favour'd child, Of fierce demeanor, and of spirit wild, Bane of delight! and horror of the sex! His plan to puzzle, and his pride to vex!— Or Scandal, filthy hag! who blindly limps Round the wide earth, supported by her imps, Her inky demons, who delight to print Her base suggestion, and her envious hint:— Or groundless Jealousy, pert changeling! born Of amorous Vanity, and angry Scorn, Whose bitter taunts with public insult dare Basely to wound the unoffending fair, Proud the sweet joys of innocence to crush, And spread o'er beauty's cheek the burning blush. Whether these kindred fiends, or one or all, Shall aim thy airy spirit to enthrall, Are points, my fondness tries in vain to reach; But trust my caution! and beware of each! Lest to thy lively mind my words may seem The vain chimera of a common dream, By one unquestionable sign be taught To prize my presence in thy waking thought! An azure ribband, on thy toilet thrown, Shall make the magic of my empire known: On this thy sportive needle tried its powers, And silver spangles form'd the mimic flowers; On these my love shall breathe a secret charm; With this, my cæstus, thy soft bosom arm! Above it let the decent tucker rise, To hide the mystic band from mortal eyes! When Spleen's dark Powers would teach that breast to swell, This guardian cincture shall those Powers repel: As the touch'd talisman, more swift than thought, To save her charge, th' Arabian Fairy brought; So shall this zone, if justly I'm obey'd, Bring my soft spirit to thy certain aid. In Love's great name observe this high behest! Revere my power—Be gentle, and be blest!” Here the kind Sprite her friendly counsel clos'd, And lightly vanish'd—Still Serena doz'd; Still in sweet trance she fondly seem'd to hear The soft persuasion vibrate in her ear. But waking now far different notes she found; Less pleasing echoes in her chamber sound; For now the heralds of the London day Sing their loud mattins in th' uncrowded way; Th' impatient milk-maid now, with early din, Screams to the rattle of her pail of tin; With sweep's faint cry, and, latest of the crew, The deep-ton'd music of the murmuring Jew. END OF THE FIRST CANTO. CANTO II. Ye radiant nymphs! whose opening eyes convey Warmth to the world, and lustre to the day! Think what o'ershadowing clouds may cross your brain, Before those lovely lids shall close again! What funds of patience twelve long hours may ask, When cold Discretion claims her daily task! Ah think betimes! and, while your morning care Sheds foreign odours o'er your fragrant hair, Tinge your soft spirit with that mental sweet, Which may not be exhal'd by passion's heat; But charm the sense, with undecaying power, Thro' every chance of each diurnal hour! O! might you all perceive your toilets crown'd With such cosmetics as Serena found! For, to the warning vision fondly true, Now the quick fair-one to the toilet flew: With keen delight her ravish'd eye survey'd The mystic ribband on her mirror laid: Bright shone the azure as Aurora's car, And every spangle seem'd a living star. With sportive grace the smiling damsel prest The guardian cincture to her snowy breast, More lovely far than Juno, when she strove To look most lovely in the eyes of Jove; And willing Venus lent her every power, That sheds enchantment o'er the amorous hour: For spells more potent on this band were thrown, Than Venus boasted in her beauteous zone. Her dazzling cæstus could alone inspire The sudden impulse of short-liv'd desire: These finer threads with lasting charms are fraught, Here lies the tender, but unchanging thought, Silence, that wins, where eloquence is vain, And tones, that harmonize the madd'ning brain, Soft sighs, that anger cannot hear, and live, And smiles, that tell, how truly they forgive; And lively grace, whose gay diffusive light Puts the black phantoms of the brain to flight, Whose cheering powers thro' every period last, And make the present happy as the past. Such secret charms this richer zone possest, Whose flowers, now sparkling on Serena's breast, Give, tho' unseen those swelling orbs they bind, Smiles to her face, and beauty to her mind: For now, observant of the Sprite's behest, The nymph conceals them by her upper vest: Safe lies the spell, no mortal may descry, Not keen Penelope's all-piercing eye; Who constant, as the steps of morn advance, Surveys the houshold with a searching glance, And entering now, with all her usual care, Reviews the chamber of the youthful fair. Beneath the pillow, not completely hid, The novel lay—She saw—she seiz'd—she chid: With rage and glee her glaring eye-balls flash, Ah wicked age! she cries, ah filthy trash! From the first page my just abhorrence springs; For modern anecdotes are monstrous things: Yet will I see what dangerous poisons lurk, To taint thy youth, in this licentious work. She said: and rudely from the chamber rush'd, Her pallid cheek with expectation flush'd, With ardent hope her eager spirit shook, Vain hope! to banquet on a luscious book. So if a priest, of the Arabian sect, In Turkish hands forbidden wine detect, The sacred mussulman, with pious din, Arraigns the culprit, and proclaims the sin, Curses with holy zeal th' inflaming juice, But cursing takes it for his secret use. The gay Serena, with unruffled mind, The pleasing novel, thus unread, resign'd. The vision on her soul such virtue left, She only smil'd at the provoking theft; The teazing incident she deem'd a jest, Nor felt the zone grow tighter on her breast. Now in full charms descends the finish'd fair, For now the morning banquet claims her care; Already at the board, with viands pil'd, Her sire impatient sits, and chides his tardy child. On his imperial lips rude hunger reigns, And keener politics usurp his brains: But when her love-inspiring voice he hears, When the soft magic of her smile appears, In that glad moment he at once forgets His empty stomach, and the nation's debts: He bends to Nature's more divine controul, And only feels the Father in his soul. Quick to his hand behold her now present The Indian liquor of celestial scent! Not with more grace the nectar'd cup is given By rose-lipp'd Hebe to the lord of heaven. While her fair hands a fresh libation pour, Fashion's loud thunder wakes the sounding door. The light Serena to the window springs, On curiosity's amusive wings: Her quick eyes sparkle with surprise, to see The glories of a golden vis-à-vis: Its glittering tablet gleam'd with mimic pearl, And the rich coronet announc'd an earl. The good old knight grew somewhat proud to hear Of this new visit from the early peer: Serena recollects the vision's truth, And fluttering, hopes it is the promis'd youth: Penelope from her high chamber peeps; There her unfinish'd charms she coyly keeps; With sage reserve her modesty abhorr'd To shew her morning face before a lord. The peer alights: the well-rang'd vassals bawl His sounding title thro' the spacious hall, Till in the deep saloon's extremest bound Th' ear-tickling words, “Lord Filligree,” resound. As when great Hector, setting war apart, Advanc'd to parley, with his spear athwart, The Greeks beheld him with a still delight; And silent reverence stopt the rising fight; With such respect, but unchastis'd by fear, Sir Gilbert and the nymph first meet the peer; And, while his morning compliments commence, The slighted breakfast stands in cold suspence. But far unlike to Hector's ruder grace His modern stature, and his modish face! Nor less he differs from those barons old, Whose arms are blazon'd on his car of gold; Whose prostrate castle guarded once the lands, Where, spruce in motley pride, his villa stands, By Taste erected, in her trimmest mode, Her mushroom structure, and her quaint abode. As the neat daisy to the sun's broad flower, As the French boudoir to the Gothic tower, Such is the peer, whom fashion much admires, Compar'd in person to his ancient sires: For their broad shoulder, and their brawny calf, Their coarse, loud language, and their coarser laugh, His finer form, more elegantly slim, Displays the fashionable length of limb: With foreign shrugs his country he regards, And her lean tongue with foreign words he lards; While Gallic Graces, who correct his style, Forbid his mirth to pass beyond a smile. As the nice workman in the wooden trade, Hides his coarse ground, with finest woods o'erlaid, Thus our young lord, with fashion's phrase refin'd, Fineer'd the mean interior of his mind: And hence, in courtesy's soft lustre seen, His spirit shone, as graceful as his mien. The artless fair, on fashion's kind report, Thought him the mirror of a matchless court: Much she his dress, his language much observes, Whose finer accents prove his feeling nerves. Her fancy now the destin'd lover spies, But her free heart abjures the quick surmise; Yet as he spoke, at every flattering word The vision's promise to her thought recurr'd. Far more parental pride contrives to blind The good Sir Gilbert's more-experienc'd mind, Who fondly saw, and at the prospect smil'd, A future countess in his favourite child. But what new flutterings shook Serena's breast, What hopes and fears the modest nymph opprest, When with a simpering smile, and soft regard, The peer display'd a mirth-expressive card, Where the gay Graces, in a sportive band, Shew the sweet art of Cipriani's hand; Where, in their train, his airy Cupids throng, And laughing drag a comic mask along! “We,” cries my lord, with self-sufficient joy, Twirling, with lordly airs, the graceful toy, “We, who possess true science, we, who give The word a lesson in the art to live, We for the fair a splendid fête design, And pay our homage thus at Beauty's shrine.” He spoke; and speaking, to the blushing maid, With modish ease, th' inviting card convey'd, Where Mirth announc'd her masque-devoted hour In characters intwin'd with many a flower: The blushing maid, with eyes of quick desire, View'd it, and felt her little soul on fire; For of all scenes she had not yet survey'd, Her heart most panted for a masquerade: But her gay hopes increasing terrors drown, And dread forebodings of her father's frown. In mute suspence to read his thought she tries, And strongly pleads with her prevailing eyes, Her eyes, for doubt enchain'd her modest tongue, While on his sovereign word her pleasure hung. With such a tender, and persuasive air Of soft endearment, and of anxious care, Thetis attended from th' almighty sire His fateful answer to her fond desire: The good old knight, like the Olympian god, Blest the fair suppliant with his gracious nod; Her lively spirit the kind signal took, And her glad heart in every fibre shook. The party settled, it imports not how, The peer politely made his parting bow: The nymph, with eyes that sparkled joyous fire, Kiss'd the round cheek of her complying sire, Then swiftly flew, and summon'd to her aid Th' important counsel of her favourite maid, To vent her joy, and, as the moments press, To fix that first of points, a fancy-dress. Quick as the poet's eyes o'er nature fly, Piercing the deep, or traversing the sky, With such light speed her fond ideas glance O'er play and poem, story and romance, While all the characters, she e'er has read, Flash on her brain, and fill her busy head. Now in Diana's form she hopes to meet A fond Endymion sighing at her feet; Now her proud thought terrestrial pomp assumes, And Dian's crescent yields to Indian plumes; Now, in the habit of the Grecian isles, She hears some Osman suing for her smiles, And sees his soul that blaze of dress outshine, Whose wealth impoverish'd a diamond-mine; Now simpler charms her quick attention draw, The rose-crown'd bonnet, and the hat of straw, A village-maid she seems, in neat attire, A faithful shepherd now her sole desire. Thus, as new figures in her fancy throng, “She's every thing by starts, and nothing long;” But, in the space of one revolving hour, Flies thro' all states of poverty and power, All forms, on whom her veering mind can pitch, Sultana, gipsy, goddess, nymph, and witch. At length, her soul with Shakespeare's magic fraught, The wand of Ariel fixt her roving thought; Ariel's light graces all her heart possess, And Jenny's order'd to prepare the dress. It seems already bought, with fond applause; An azure tissue, and a silver gauze; Too soon, alas! that garb of heavenly hue The ready mercer flashes to her view. Ah blind to fate! how oft the youthful belle Feels her gay heart at sight of tissue swell! And thinks the fashionable silk must prove Her robe of triumph, and a spell to love! To thee, sweet maid, whose pleasure-darting eyes Joy in this favourite vest, an hour shall rise, When thou shalt hate the silk so fondly sought, And wish thy silver-spotted gauze unbought Nescia mens hominum fati sortisque futuræ, Et servare modum, rebus sublata secundis. Turno tempus erit, magno cum optaverit emptum Intactum Pallanta, et cum spolia ista diemque Oderit. Æneid. x. v. 501. &amp; seq. For busy Spleen thy trial now prepares; Darkly she forms her unsuspected snares, And, keen to raise her pleasure-killing storm, Assumes Penelope's congenial form. In that prim shape, which all the graces shun, See the sour fiend to good Sir Gilbert run! Where, deeply pondering the public debt, Silent he muses o'er a new gazette! Ent'ring, she view'd, with eyes of envious spite, The card, that spoke the masque-devoted night: Eager she darted on the graceful toy, And, fiercely pointing to each naked boy, “Canst thou,” she cried, in a discordant scream, That rous'd the politician from his dream, While with her voice the echoing chamber rings, “ ??? ?????, ?? ????????, ???? ???? ??????? ????, &amp;c. Iliad ?. v. 872. &amp; seq.Say! canst thou suffer these flagitious things? Are these devices to thy daughter brought, That wake such gross impurity of thought? In vain are all the prudent words I preach, The modest maxims that I strive to teach; By foolish fondness of your sense beguil'd, You still indulge, and spoil the flippant child: For me, whate'er I say is deem'd absurd; She scorns my sage advice:—but mark my word, If to this ball you let the hoyden run, Your power is ended, and the girl undone.” The patriot knight, by interruption vext, In his political pursuits perplext, While he with wrath th' intruding Mischief eyed, Stern to the false Penelope replied: “Go! teazing prude, cease in my ears to vent Thy envious pride, and peevish discontent! To me of prudence canst thou vainly boast? Of all my houshold, thou hast plagu'd me most: The joys thou blamest are thy dear delight, By day the visit, and the ball by night: And, tho' too old a lover to trepan, Thy midnight dream, thy morning thought, is man. Wert thou less closely to my blood allied, Thou should'st, to cure thee of thy canting pride, Be sent to sigh alone o'er purling brooks, Scold village maids, and croak to croaking rooks.” He spoke indignant: the sly fiend withdrew, Nor inly griev'd; for well her force she knew. As Indian females, in a jealous hour, Of secret poison try the subtlest power, Which sure, tho' slow, corrodes th' unconscious prey, And ends its triumph on a distant day: Thus the departing Fury lest behind Her venom, latent in Sir Gilbert's mind. The hidden mischief tho' no eye observes, He feels it fretting on his alter'd nerves; But the kind habit of his healthy soul Still struggled hard against its base controul. Now Spleen's dark vapours, in his bosom hid, Prompt him the promis'd pleasure to forbid; Now Love's soft pleadings that dire thought destroy, And save the blossom of his daughter's joy; Her envious aunt now serves him for a jest, And gay good-humour reassumes his breast. While Spleen's dark power now sinks, and now revives, At length the day, th' important day, arrives, Which in his breast must end the close debate, And fix the colour of Serena's fate. Now comes the hour, when the convivial knight Waits to begin the dinner's chearful rite; His fond heart ever, with a father's pride, Joys to behold his darling at his side; But most the absence of her smile he feels In the gay season of his social meals: Hence, while for her the rich repast attends, His hasty summons to the nymph he sends: The happy nymph superior cares induce To risk his anger by a rash excuse: She craves his pardon; but, for time distrest, She still is busy on her magic vest; To range her diamonds in a sparkling zone, She begs to snatch her scanty meal alone. The knight in sullen state begins to dine: Spleen, like a harpy, flutters o'er his wine: Invisible she poisons every dish, Tinging with gall his mutton, fowl, and fish. The more he eats, the more perverse he grows; For as his hunger sunk, his choler rose. The cloth remov'd, he cries, with vapours sick, The pears are mellow, and the port is thick; Tho' nicer fruit Pomona never knew, And his rich wine surpass'd the ruby's hue! A thousand times his dizzy brain revolves A stern command: now doubts, and now resolves To bid the nymph descend, and, disarray'd, Quit her dear project of of the masquerade: As oft kind nature to his heart recurr'd, And love parental stopt the cruel word. Mean time, unconscious of the brooding storm, The nymph exults in her improving form: Gay is her smile, as those the queen of love Darts on the Graces in her court above, While they contrive, with love-inspiring cares, New modes of beauty for the robe she wears. At length, each duty of the toilet past, The glance of triumph on the mirror cast, Now the light wand our finish'd Ariel arms; Glad Jenny glories in her lady's charms; And gives full utterance, as she smooths her vest, To the sweet bodings of Serena's breast. O! lovely bias of the female soul! Which trembling points to pleasure's distant pole; Which with fond trust on flattering hope relies, O'erleaps each peril, that in prospect lies, And springing to the goal, anticipates the prize! Such was Serena's fear-discarding state; Her eye beheld not the dark frowns of fate; She only saw, the combat all forgot, The triumph promis'd as her glorious lot. Now, eager to display her light attire, The sprightly damsel seeks her sullen sire; His gloomy brow with sportive air she kist: Ah! how could Spleen that magic lip resist? That voice, whose melting music might assuage The scorpion Anger's self-tormenting rage? For ne'er did nature to a sire's embrace Present a filial form of softer grace; Or fancy view a shape of lovelier kind In the bright mirror of her Shakespeare's mind. The sulky fiend, in spite of all her art, Had now been banish'd from the father's heart, But that, resolv'd her utmost force to try, She summon'd to her aid her old ally, The fiery demon, temper-troubling Gout, Who sinks the lively, and appals the stout; Who now, assisting Spleen's malignant aim, Shoots in quick throbbings through Sir Gilbert's frame. Thus sorely pester'd by a double foe, Galling his giddy brain, and burning toe, The testy knight, with stern and sullen air, Denounc'd his humour to the shudd'ring fair: “Go change your dress! give up this vain delight! I will not hear of masquerades to-night; Your chaperone's inform'd she need not wait, So change your dress! and sit with me sedate.” As the proud dame, whose avaricious glee Built golden castles in the rich South Sea, Gaz'd on her broker, when he told her first Her wealth was vanish'd, and the bubble burst: So gaz'd the nymph, hearing her sire destroy Her airy palace of ideal joy. First her fond thoughts to flattering doubt incline, And deem the harsh command no fix'd design, But the quick sally of a peevish word, That love revokes, the moment it is heard: Or haply mirth, in mimic wrath exprest, A feign'd forbiddance utter'd but in jest: To this short hope her sinking spirit clung, To see his softening eyes refute his tongue. Ah fruitless hope! for there she cannot find The well-known signals of the friendly mind. Stern contradiction, with the frown of fate, On his dark visage reign'd in sullen state; Felt in each feature, in each accent shown, Lower'd in his look, and thunder'd in his tone. Hence the warm bosom of the lively fair Now shivers with the chill of blank despair: Now disappointment's thick'ning shadows roll A cloud of horror o'er the darken'd soul; And fancy, in a sick delirium tost, Gives double value to each pleasure lost. The blasted joys, she labours to forget, Rush on her mind, and waken keen regret: Her cheek turns pale—the tear prepares to start, And palpitation heaves her swelling heart. But here, Sophrosyne! thy guardian aid Saves from her potent foe the sinking maid. Her bosom, into strong emotions thrown, Now seels the pressure of thy friendly zone. Swift thy kind cautions to her soul recur, More quick to cancel faults, than prone to err. As the rough swell of the insurgent tides By the mild impulse of the moon subsides: So, by her mystic monitor represt, The flood of passion leaves her lighten'd breast, From her clear brain each cloudy vapour flies, And joy's bright ray rekindles in her eyes. Reviving gaiety full lustre spread O'er all her features, and with smiles she said: “Let others drive to pleasure's distant home! Be mine the dearer joy to please at home!” Scarce had she spoke, when she with sportive ease Prest her piano-forte's fav'rite keys, O'er softest notes her rapid fingers ran, Sweet prelude to the Air she thus began! Sophrosyne! thou guard unseen! Whose delicate controul Can turn the discord of chagrin To harmony of soul! Above the lyre, the lute above, Be mine thy melting tone, Which makes the peace of all we love The basis of our own! So sung the nymph, not uninspir'd: the sprite Invok'd so fondly in the mystic rite, With richest music swell'd her warbling throat, And gave new sweetness to her sweetest note. As when the seraph Uriel first begun His carol to the new-created sun, The sacred echo shook the vast profound, And chaos perish'd at the potent sound: So, at the magic of Serena's strain, Spleen vanish'd from her sire's chaotic brain; Whose fibres, lighten'd of that load, rejoice In the dear accents of her dulcet voice. Much he inclines his mandate to recall, And send the fair-one to the promis'd ball; But stubborn pride forbids him to revoke The solemn sentence, which ill-humour spoke. Still, conscious of her power, the nymph prolongs The soft enchantment of her soothing songs; Which his fond mind in firm attention keep, To his fixt hour of supper and of sleep: This now arriv'd, the knight, retiring, shed A double blessing on his darling's head; And with unusual exultation prest His lovely child to his parental breast. Thus while to rest the happy sire withdrew, The nymph, more happy, to her chamber flew; And, Jenny now dismiss'd, the grateful fair Breathes to her guardian Sprite this tender prayer: “Thou kind preserver! whose attentive zeal Gives me in this contended hour to feel That dearest pleasure of a soul refin'd, The triumph of the self-corrected mind; If, happy in the strength thy smiles impart, I own thy favour in no thankless heart, Still let me view thy form, so justly dear! Still in kind visions to these eyes appear! Thy friendly dictates teach me to fulfil! And let thy aid avert each future ill!” While fond devotion taught her thus to speak, The soft down sinks beneath her lovely cheek, And settling on her lips, that sweetly close, Silence, enamour'd, lulls her to repose. END OF THE SECOND CANTO. CANTO III. Ye kind transporters of th' excursive soul! Ye visions! that, when night enwraps the pole, The lively wanderer to new worlds convey, Escaping from her heavy house of clay, How could the gentle spirit, foe to strife, Bear without you this coil of waking life? Its grief-embitter'd cares, its joyless mirth, And all the flat realities of earth? Sweet phantoms! you the glowing hope inspire, You give to beauty charms, to fancy fire, When, soaring like the eagle's kindred frame, The poet dreams of everlasting fame; Or, tickled by the feather of the dove, The softer virgin dreams of endless love. There was a time, when fortune's bright decrees Were seen to realize such dreams as these: Now dangerous visions the fond mind decoy Vainly to pant for unexisting joy, While belles and bards with mournful sighs exclaim, Mortality has seiz'd both Love and Fame. Ah fair Serena, might the boast be ours To clear from such a charge these heavenly powers! Blest! might thy bard deserve in Fame to see A guard as faithful, as Love proves to thee! Blest! if that airy being gild his life, Who sav'd thee trembling on the brink of strife, And now, kind prompter of thy nightly dream, Fill'd thy rapt spirit with her sacred beam! For soon as slumber set thy soul at large, Thy Guardian Power revisited her charge; And, lightly hovering o'er th' illumin'd bed, Thus with fond smiles of approbation said: “Well hast thou past, sweet maid, one trying scene, One fiery ordeal of the tyrant Spleen: Thus, my Serena, may thy force sustain Each harder trial, that may yet remain! Against the fiend to fortify thy soul, By useful knowledge of her dark controul, I come to show thee, what no mortal eye, Save thine, was e'er permitted to descry; The realms, where Spleen's infernal agents goad The ghostly tenants of her drear abode. Now summon all thy strength! throw fear aside, And firmly trust in thy æthereal guide!” She spoke: and thro' the night's surrounding shade Th' obedient nymph, not unappall'd, convey'd; Thro' long, long tracts of darkness, on they past With speed, that struck the trembling maid aghast, Till now, recovering by degrees, she found Her soft foot press upon the solid ground. Encourag'd by her guide, at length she tries To search the gloomy scene, with anxious eyes. Per me si va nella citta dolente, Per me si va nell' eterno dolore, Per me si va tra la perduta gente, Lasciate ogni speranza, voi ch' intrate, Queste parole di colore oscuro Vid' io scritte al sommo d'una porta. Dante, Inferno. 3.“Thro' me ye pass to Spleen's terrisic dome, Thro' me, to Discontent's eternal home: Thro' me, to those, who sadden'd human life, By sullen humour or vexatious strife; And here, thro' scenes of endless vapours hurl'd, Are punish'd in the forms they plagued the world; Justly they feel no joy, who none bestow, All ye who enter, every hope forego!” O'er an arch'd cavern, rough with horrid stone, On which a feeble light, by flashes, shone, These characters, that chill'd her soul with dread, Serena, fixt in silent wonder, read. As she began to speak, her voice was drown'd By the shrill echo of far other sound: Forth from the portal lamentable cries Of wailing infants, without number, rise. Compassion to this poor and piteous flock Led the soft maid still nearer to the rock. The pining band within she now espied, And, touch'd with tender indignation, cried, “How could these little forms, of life so brief, Deserve this dire abode of lasting grief?” “—Well may thy gentle heart be sore concern'd At sight so moving,” the mild Sprite return'd: “Thou seest in those, whose wailings wound thy ears, The puny progeny of modern peers: Their sires, by avarice or ambition led, Aliens to love, approach'd the nuptial bed; With proud indifference, and with cold distaste, Their homely brides reluctantly embrac'd, And by such union gave disastrous birth To these poor pale incumbrances of earth, Who, bred in vanity, with pride their dower, Were Spleen's sure victims from their natal hour, And in their splendid cradles pul'd and pin'd, Till Fate their ill-spun thread of life untwin'd, And to this vestibule convey'd their ghosts, To form the van-guard of th' infernal hosts. But let not pity's ineffectual charm Impede thy progress, or thy strength disarm! Follow and fear not! guarded by my care From all the phantoms that around thee glare.” She spoke; and enter'd, ere the nymph replied, A pass, that open'd in the cavern's side, Low, dark, and rocky—with her body bent, Serena follow'd down the dire descent. A sudden light soon struck her dazzled view; But 'twas a light of such infernal hue, As double horror to the darkness gave, With dread reflection from a dusky wave. Round a black water tatter'd spectres stand, With each a tiny taper in its hand; Fierce mendicants! who strive some alms to win From the fair wanderer, with incessant din. The guardian Spirit saw Serena grieve, To hear of wants she knew not to relieve; And to the generous nymph in pity cries: “The gulf of Indolence before us lies, O'er whose dull flood, to which no bank is seen, A boat must waft thee to the dome of Spleen. These pallid figures, that around thee press, And haunt thee with importunate distress, On earth were beggars of each different class, Tho' blended here in one promiscuous mass. The poor, who spurn'd kind industry's controul, The rich, who begg'd from penury of soul: Both by their abject pride alike debas'd, Blasphem'd that nature, which they both disgrac'd, And, hither by the sullen fiend convey'd, Here still they ply their ineffectual trade; In chase of each new passenger they run, Condemn'd to beg from all, to gain by none. But from these wretches turn thy fruitless care! Behold the gulf before thee, and beware! Nor touch the stream, which mortal sense o'ercomes, And by its baleful charm the soul benumbs!” “—Can mortal pass!” the shudd'ring nymph replied, “This sullen, slow, unnavigable tide, In whose black current this enormous mound Of shapeless stone appears, this horrid bound, That seems an everlasting guard to keep O'er the dull waters, that beneath it creep?” While yet she spoke, with a resounding shock, Forth from the arch of the impending rock, Which o'er the murmuring eddy hung so low, The lazy river scarce had room to flow, Of rude construction, and in roughest plight, A boat now issued to Serena's sight; An empty boat, that slowly to the shore Advanc'd, without the aid of sail or oar; Self-mov'd it seem'd, but soon the nymph beheld A grisly figure, who the stern impell'd. Wading behind, the horrid form appear'd; Above the water his strong arm he rear'd, And cross the creeping flood the crazy vessel steer'd. The heavenly Sprite observ'd her trembling ward, Whose growing fears the hideous pass abhorr'd, And cheering thus she spake: “This spectre boasts The chief dominion of these dreary coasts: To him, thy pilot, without dread consign, And place thy body in his bark supine! So thro' this arching rock thou'lt pass alone, Safe from the perils of the incumbent stone: Embark undaunted!—on the farther side Thou'lt surely find me, thy unfailing guide. Nor let this pilot raise thy groundless dread, This sullen Charon of the froward dead, A phantom, never blest with human life, Tho' oft on earth his noxious power is rife; And in that region, ne'er from error free, The words he dictates are assign'd to me. Observe this fiend, that Nature scorn'd to frame, Offspring of Pride, and Apathy his name! Passions he ne'er can feel, and ne'er impart, A miscreated imp, without a heart; In place of which, his subtle parent pinn'd A bladder, fill'd with circulating wind, Which seems with mimic life the mass to warm, And gives false vigour to his bloated form. But place thee in the boat his arms direct, My love shall watch thee, and my power protect.” So spake the friendly Sprite; th' obedient maid Her form along the narrow vessel laid: But oh! what terrors shake her tender soul, As from the shore the bark begins to roll, And, sever'd from her friend, her eyes discern The steering spectre wading at the stern! Far stronger fears her resolution melt, Than those, which erst the bard of Florence felt, When, by the honour'd shade of Virgil led Thro' all the dreary circles of the dead, Hell's fiercest demons threaten'd to divide The living poet from his shadowy guide; And bade him, friendless, and alone, return, Thro' the dire horrors of the dark sojourn. Not long the lovely fair-one's terrors last; For safely thro' th' impending rock she past: And slow advancing to the gloomy strand, The sullen pilot brings her safe to land. There, fondly hovering on her guardian plumes, The heavenly Monitor her charge resumes; And smiling, leads along the rocky road, Whose windings open into Spleen's abode. Thou queen of shades! whose spirit-damping spell Too oft is seen the poet's pride to quell, May I, unpunish'd by thy subtle power, Dare to display thy subterranean bower, And to this wond'ring upper world explain The shadowy horrors of thy secret reign? Entering beneath a wide fantastic arch, Round the drear circuit of the dome they march; Which a pale flash from many a fiery sprite Frequent illumes with intermitting light; Such, as on earth, to Superstition's eye, Denounces ruin from the northern sky, While she discerns, amid the nightly glare, Armies embattled in the blazing air. Around the nymph unnumber'd phantoms glide; Here swell the bloated race of bulky Pride: In close and horrid union, there appear The wilder progeny of frantic Fear; Mis-shapen monsters! whose stupendous frame Abhorrent Nature has refus'd to name. Here, in cameleon colours, lightly slit The motley offspring of disorder'd Wit. All things prodigious the wide cave contain'd, And forms, beyond what fable ever feign'd: But, as the worm, that on the dewy green Springs half to view, and half remains useen, Perceiving near its cell a human tread, Slinks back to earth, and hides its timid head: So, where the heavenly Spirit deign'd to lead, The startled spectres from her step recede; And, as abash'd they from her eye retire, Sink into mist, or melt in fluid fire. High on an ebon throne, superbly wrought With each fierce figure of fantastic thought, In a deep cove, where no bright beam intrudes, O'er her black schemes the sullen empress broods. The screechowl's mingled with the raven's plume Shed o'er her furrow'd brows an awful gloom; A garb, that glares with stripes of lurid flame, Wraps in terrific pomp her haggard frame; Round her a serpent, as her zone, is roll'd, Which, writhing, stings itself in every fold. Near her pavilion, in barbaric state, Four mutes the mandates of their queen await. From sickly Fancy bred, by sullen Sloth, Both parents' curse, yet pamper'd still by both, First stands Disease; an hag of magic power, Varying her frightful visage every hour, Her horrors heightening, as those changes last, And each new form more hideous than the past. Detraction next, a shapeless fiend, appears, Whose shrivell'd hand a misty mirror rears; Fram'd by malignant Art, th' infernal toy Inverts the lovely mien of smiling Joy, Robs roseate Beauty of attractive grace, And gives a stepdame's frown to Nature's face. The third in place, but with a fiercer air, See the true Gorgon Disappointment glare! By whose petrific power Delight's o'erthrown; And Hope's warm heart becomes an icy stone. Last, in a gorgeous robe, that, ill bestow'd, Bows her mean body by its cumbrous load, Stands fretful Discontent, of fiends the worst, By dignity debas'd, by blessings curst, Who poisons Pleasure with the sourest leaven, And makes a hell of Love's ecstatic heaven. The guide celestial, near this ghastly group, Perceiv'd her tender charge with terror droop: “Fear not, sweet maid,” she cries, “my steps pursue! Nor gaze too long on this infernal crew! Turn from Detraction's fascinating glass! In silence cross the throne! observe, and pass! Beyond this dome, the palace of the queen, Her empire winds thro' many a dreary scene, Where she torments, as their deserts require, Her various victims, that on earth expire; Each class apart: for in a different cell The fierce, the fretful, and the sullen dwell: These shalt thou slightly view, in vapours hurl'd, And swiftly then regain thy native world. But first remark, within that ample nich, With every quaint device of splendor rich, Yon phantom, who, from vulgar eyes withdrawn, Appears to stretch in one eternal yawn: Of empire here he holds the tottering helm, Prime minister in Spleen's discordant realm, The pillar of her spreading state, and more, Her darling offspring, whom on earth she bore; For, as on earth his wayward mother stray'd, Grandeur, with eyes of fire, her form survey'd, And with strong passion starting from his throne, Unloos'd the sullen queen's reluctant zone. From his embrace, conceiv'd in moody joy, Rose the round image of a bloated boy: His nurse was Indolence; his tutor Pomp, Who kept the child from every childish romp; They rear'd their nursling to the bulk you see, And his proud parents call'd their imp Ennui. This realm he rules, and in superb attire Visits each earthly palace of his sire: A thousand shapes he wears, now pert, now prim, Pursues each grave conceit, or idle whim; In arms, in arts, in government engages, With monarchs, poets, politicians, sages; But drops each work, the moment it's begun, And, trying all things, can accomplish none: Yet o'er each rank, and age, and sex, his sway Spreads undiscern'd, and makes the world his prey. The light coquet, amid flirtation, sighs, To find him lurk in Pleasure's vain disguise; And the grave nun discovers, in her cell, That holy water but augments his spell. As the strange monster, of the serpent breed, That haunts, as travellers tell, the marshy mead, Devours each nobler beast, tho' firmly grown To size and strength superior to his own;— For on the grazing horse, or larger bull, Subtly he springs, of dark saliva full, With swiftly-darting tongue his prey anoints With venom, potent to dissolve its joints, And, while its bulk in liquid poison swims, Swallows its melting bone and fluid limbs:— So this Ennui, this wonder-working elf, Can vanquish powers far mightier than himself: Nor Wit nor Science soar his reach above, And oft he seizes on successful Love. Of all the radiant host who lend their aid To light mankind thro' life's bewildering shade, Bright Charity alone, with cloudless ray, May boast exemption from his baleful sway: Haste then, sweet nymph, nor let us longer roam Round the drear circle of this dangerous dome! Lest e'en thy guide, entangled in his spell, Should fail to guard thee from a fiend so fell!” So speaking, the kind Spirit's anxious care Led from the palace the attentive fair, And, winding through a passage dark and rude, Thus the mild monitor her speech renew'd: “'Gainst fear and pity now thy bosom steel, For sights more horrible I now reveal! Spleen's tortur'd victims view with dauntless eyes; For lo! her penal realms before thee rise!” The nymph advancing saw, with mute amaze, A dismal, deep, enormous dungeon blaze. Stones of red fire the hideous wall compos'd; And massive gates the horrid confine clos'd, Th' infernal portress of this doleful dome, With fiery lips, that swell'd with poisonous foam, Pale Discord, rag'd; with whose tormenting tongue, Thro' all its caves th' extensive region rung: A living vulture was the fury's crest; And in her hand a rattlesnake she prest, Whose angry joints incessantly were heard To sound defiance to the screaming bird. “The boundless depth of this dire prison holds The untam'd spirits of imperious scolds: Nor think that females only fill the cave! Male termagants have liv'd, and here they rave. All of each sex are pent within this pale, Who knew no use of language, but to rail.” Thus to her charge exclaim'd the heavenly guide, And, as she spoke, the portals open'd wide, And to th' observance of the shuddering maid, Th' immeasurable den was all display'd. But oh! what various noises from within Fill the vext air with one stupendous din! Mourning's deep groan, and anger's furious call Terror's loud cry, and affectation's squall, The sob of passion, the hysteric scream. And shrieks of frenzy, in its fierce extreme! In this wild uproar every sound's combin'd, That stuns the senses, and distracts the mind. “Mark” (to the nymph Sophrosyne began) “The fierce Xantippe flaming in the van, The vase, she emptied on the sage's head, Hangs o'er her own, a different shower to shed; For, drop by drop, distilling liquid fire, It fills the vixen with new tropes of ire. Beyond the Grecian dame extend your view, And mark the spectre of a modern shrew! She, who whene'er she din'd, with furious look, Spurn'd her nice food, and bellow'd at her cook, Here justly feels a culinary rack, Bound like Ixion, to a whirling jack.” Serena gaz'd, but soon she turn'd away, Mute with disgust, and shuddering with dismay, “To scenes less hideous let us now repair!” (Said the kind guard of the dejected fair) And, cheering her faint charge, her step she led To the near dwelling of the fretful dead. Of dusky adamant the dungeon rose; A dingy mirror its dark sides compose, Reflecting, with a thousand quaint grimaces, The pale inhabitants' distorted faces. “Here, like a dame of quality array'd, Sits Peevishness, presiding o'er the shade, And frowning at her own uncomely mien, Whose coarse reflection on the wall is seen. A snarling lap-dog her right hand restrains, Her lap an infant porcupine contains, Which, while her fondness tries its wrath to still, Wounds her each moment with a pointed quill. The froward spirits here in durance fret, Whose testy life was one continued pet; Here they in trifles that vexation find, Which teaz'd on earth their irritated mind. Observe the phantom, who with eyes askance Still to the mirror turns her eager glance! See! to her cheek, incessant as she turns, Her vex'd blood rushes, and her visage burns. Beauty for lasting bliss had form'd the maid; Love to her charms his faithful homage paid; But, all this swelling tide of joy to check, A fatal freckle rises on her neck: Her soft cosmetics the griev'd nymph applies, Success attends her, and the freckle dies: But an! this victory avails her not; She finds an hydra in the teazing spot: Fast as one flies, another still succeeds, And with eternal food her fretful humour feeds. Near to the nymph, in a more moody fit, See the pale phantom of a peevish wit! Mark with what frowns his eager eyes peruse, Wet from the press, three Critical Reviews With wounded vanity's distracting rage How rapidly he runs thro' every page! He finds some honours lavish'd on his verse, And joy's faint gleams his gloomy spirit pierce. But oh! too soon these feeble sparks decay: And keen vexation reassumes her prey. Hating reproof, in every fibre sore, One censur'd particle torments him more, More than a hundred happier lines delight, Which liberal favour condescends to cite. But time will fail us, if we pause to view The various torments of the testy crew; These wretched chymists, whose o'erheated brain Extracts from nothing a substantial pain. Yet, ere to different districts we advance, Take of one fretful tribe a transient glance! Their unsuspected punishments supply A lesson, useful to the female eye. Spleen's liveliest agent here beguiles the gay, Fair to attract, and flattering to betray.” As thus the kind æthereal guardian spoke, Within a rock, whence plaintive murmurs broke, She touch'd a secret spring, whose power was such, Two jarring doors unfolded at the touch, And, with the charms of regal splendor bright, A chearful banquet sparkles to the sight. Viands so light, so elegantly grac'd, Might tempt e'en Temperance herself to taste; For fruits alone compos'd th' enticing treat, Fair to the eye, and to the palate sweet. In such bright juice the peach and cherry swim, As make the topaz and the ruby dim. Here crown'd with every flower, and gaily drest In all the glitter of a Gallic vest, Whose ample folds her loathsome body screen'd, A child of luxury reigns, a subtle fiend! Who, with a grace that every heart allures, Smiles on the lustre of her rich liqueurs. Her fatal smiles their utmost power exert To poison beauty at her dire dessert; To blast the rose that health's bright cheek adorns, And fill each festive heart with latent thorns: For the sly fiend, of every art possest, Steals on th' affection of her female guest; And, by her soft address seducing each, Eager she plies them with a brandy peach: They with keen lip the luscious fruit devour; But swiftly feel its peace-destroying power. Quick thro' each vein new tides of frenzy roll: All evil passions kindle in the soul, Drive from each feature every chearful grace, And glare ferocious in the sallow face; The wounded nerves in furious conflict tear, Then sink, in blank dejection and despair. Effects more dire, thus tempting to deceive, The apple wrought not in the soul of Eve; Howe'er disguis'd, in jelly or in jam, Spleen has no poison surer than a dram. “But haste we now” (the heavenly leader cries) “To where this penal world's last wonder lies!” She spoke; and led the nymph thro' deeper dells, Low-murmuring vaults, and horror-breathing cells. And now they pass a perforated cage, Where rancorous spectres without number rage. “Avert thine eye!” (the heavenly Spirit said) “Nor view these abject tribes of envious dead! Who pin'd to hear the voice of truth proclaim A sister's beauty, or a brother's fame! Tho' crown'd with all prosperity imparts, High in their various ranks, and several arts; Yet, meanly sunk by envy's base controul, They died in that consumption of the soul; And here, thro' bars that twisted adders make, And the long volumes of th' envenom'd snake, O'er this dark road they dart an anxious eye, Still envying evey fiend that flutters by. Pass! and regard them not!”—Th' attentive maid In silent tremor the behest obey'd. This dungeon crost, her weary feet she drags Thro' winding caverns, and o'er icy crags: Soul-chilling damps in the dark passage reign, Which issues on a vast and dreary plain, Fann'd by no breezes, with no verdure crown'd; The black horizon is its only bound. And now advancing, in a drizzly mist, Thro' sullen phantoms, hating to exist, Serena spies, high o'er his subjects plac'd, The ghastly tyrant of the gloomy waste. Murmuring he sits upon a rocking stone, Th' unstable base of his ill-founded throne: Hideous his face, and horrible his frame, Misanthropy the grisly monster's name! Him to fierce Pride, with raging passion sore, The frowning gorgon, Disappointment, bore; On earth detested, and by heaven abhorr'd, Of this drear wild he reigns the moody lord. Few are the subjects of his waste domain, And scarce a female in his frightful train, Except one changing corps of ancient prudes: Reluctant here the prying band intrudes. Each, who on earth, behind her artful fan, Feign'd coarse aversion to the creature man, Is doom'd, in this dark region, to abide Some transient pains for hypocritic pride. Here ever-during chains those scoffers bind, Whose writings deaden and debase the mind; Who mock creation with injurious scorn, And feel a fancied void in plenty's horn. In his right-hand, an emblem of his cares, A branch of aconite the monarch bears; And those sour phantoms, who this region haunt, He feeds with berries from this deadly plant; For, strange to tell! tho' sever'd from its root, The bough still blackens with successive fruit. The tribes, who taste it, burst into a fit Of raving mockery and rancorous wit; And, pleas'd their tyrant's ghastly smile to court, By vile distortions make him various sport. The frantic rabble, who his sway confess, Before his throne an hideous puppet dress; When in unseemly rags they have array'd The image, from their own dark semblance made, In horrid gambols round their work they throng, With antic dance and rude discordant song; Satire's rank offals on the block they fling, And call it nature, to delight their king: While in their features he exults to see The frowns of torture, mixt with grins of glee. For, as these abject toils engage the crew, Their own grim idol darkens to their view; Wide and more wide its horrid stature spreads, And o'er the tribe new consternation sheds: For each forgets, in his bewilder'd gaze, 'Tis but a monster, which he help'd to raise. As o'er its form their dizzy glances roll, It strikes a chearless damp thro' all the soul. Vainly to shun the baleful sight they try, It draws for ever the reluctant eye: At each review with deeper dread they start; A colder chaos numbs each freezing heart. No mutual confidence, no friendly care, Relieves the panic they are doom'd to bear; For as they shrink absorb'd in wild affright, When each to each inclines his wounded sight. They feel, for social comfort, sour disgust, And all the sullen anguish of distrust. Around these wretches in the drear abode, The ghastly grinning fiend Derision rode, Who to their wayward minds on earth supplied Perverted ridicule's malignant tide. His steed of Pegasus the semblance bore; But with false wings, that knew not how to soar Where'er he pass'd, with mischief in his look, A sounding whip of knotted snakes he shook; And laugh'd in lashing each pretended sage, Whose malice wore the mask of moral rage. An uncouth bugle his left-hand display'd, From a grey monkey's skull by Cunning made, And form'd to pour, in harmony's despite, Sounds that each jarring sense of pain excite: And now his livid lips this bugle blew; Thro' every den the piercing discord flew: The fiends all answer'd in one hideous yell, And in a fearful trance Serena fell. Hence from the lovely nymph her senses fled, Till, thro' the parted curtains of her bed, The amorous sun, who now began to rise, Kist, with a sportive beam, her opening eyes. END OF THE THIRD CANTO. CANTO IV. Hail, thou enlighten'd globe of human joy! Where social cares the soften'd heart employ: What cheering rays of vital comfort roll In thy bright regions o'er the rescued soul, Which, 'scaping from the dark domain of Spleen, Springs with new warmth to thy attractive scene! Once more I bless thy pleasure-breathing gale, And gaze enchanted on thy flowery vale, Where smiling innocence, and ardent youth, Sport hand in hand with beauty and with truth. Sport on, sweet revellers! in rosy bowers, Safe from th' intrusion of all evil powers! Ah fruitless wish of the benignant Muse, Which to this chequer'd world the Fates refuse! For round its precincts many an ugly sprite Speeds undiscern'd to poison pure delight: Amidst the foremost of this haggard band, Unwearied poster of the sea and land, Wrapt in dark mists, malignant Scandal flies, While Envy's poison'd breath the buoyant gale supplies. Tho' Sheridan, with shafts of comic wit, Pierc'd, and expos'd her to the laughing pit, Th' immortal hag still wears her paper crown, The dreaded empress of the idle town: O'erleaping her prerogative of old, To sink the noble, to defame the bold;— In chase of worth to slip the dogs of strife, Thro' all the ample range of public life;— The tyrant now, that sanctuary burst Where happiness by privacy is nurst, Her fury rising as her powers increase, O'erturns the altars of domestic peace. Pleas'd in her dark and gall-distilling cloud The sportive form of innocence to shroud, Beauty's young train her baleful eyes survey, To mark the fairest, as her favourite prey. Hence, sweet Serena, while thy spirit stray'd Round the deep realms of subterranean shade, This keenest agent of th' infernal powers On earth was busied, in those tranquil hours, To blast thy peace, and poison'd darts to aim Against the honour of thy spotless name: For Scandal, restless fiend, who never knows The balmy blessing of an hour's repose, Worn, yet unsated with her daily toil, In her base work consumes the midnight oil. O'er fiercer fiends when heavy slumbers creep, When wearied avarice and ambition sleep, Scandal is vigilant, and keen to spread The plagues that spring from her prolific head. On truth's fair basis she her falsehood builds, With tinsel sentiment its surface gilds; To nightly labour from their dark abodes The demons of the groaning press she goads, And smiles to see their rapid art supply Ten thousand wings to every infant lie. In triumph now behold the hag applaud Her keen and fav'rite imp, ingenious Fraud, Her quick compositor, whose flying hand Has clos'd the paragraph she keenly plann'd. No nymph she nam'd, yet mark'd her vile intent, That dulness could not miss the name she meant: In satire's tints the injur'd fair she drew, In form an angel, but in soul a Jew. It chanc'd her sire among his friends inroll'd A wealthy senator, infirm and old; Who, dup'd too early by a generous heart, Rashly assum'd a misanthropic part: Tho' peevish fancies would his mind incrust, Good-nature's image lurk'd beneath their rust; And gay Serena, with that sportive wit Which heals the folly that it deigns to hit, Would oft the sickness of his soul beguile, And teach the sullen humorist to smile; Pleas'd by her virtuous frolics to assuage The mental anguish of distemper'd age. This ancient friend, in a sarcastic sketch, Was mark'd by Scandal as a monied wretch, For whom the young, yet mercenary fair Had subtly spread a matrimonial snare. With such base matter, more diffusely wrought, The spirit-piercing paragraph was fraught, O'er which with glee the eye of Scandal glar'd, Which for the opening press herself prepar'd; She on the types her inky wad let fall, And smear'd each letter with her bitterest gall; The press, whose ready gripe the charge receives, Stamps it successive on ten thousand leaves, Which pil'd in heaps impatient seem to lie, They only wait the dawn of day to fly. Now, as the child, in lonely chamber laid, Mute in the dark, and of itself afraid, When, haply conscious of the pain it feels, The watchful mother to its pillow steals, Springs to her breast, and shakes off all alarms, Feeling its safety in her fostering arms: With such quick joy, in innocence as young, The soft Serena from her pillow sprung, Pleas'd to awake from her terrific dream, And feel the chearful's sun's returning beam. Eager she rose, in busy thought, nor staid The wonted summons of her punctual maid, And as her own fair hands adjust her vest, The guardian cincture flutters on her breast; For fondly, when she wak'd, or when she slept, Still round her heart th' important zone she kept. Thou happy girdle! to thy charge be just! Firm be thy threads, and faithful to their trust; For hours approach, when all the stores they hide Of magic virtue, must be strongly tried!— Now, while her kind domestic heart intends To please her early sire, the nymph descends; But sleep, who left the fair with sudden flight, With late wings hover'd o'er the good old knight; And the chill circle of the lone saloon Informs the shiv'ring maid she rose too soon. 'Tis true, attentive John's unfailing care Began the rites of breakfast to prepare; But yet no fires on the cold altar burn, No smoke arises from the silver urn, And the blank tea-board, where no viands lay, Only supplied the paper of the day. Tho' mild Serena's peace-devoted mind The keen debate of politics declin'd, And heard with cold contempt, or generous hate, The frauds of party and the lies of state; Nor car'd much more for fashion's loose intrigues, Than factious bickerings or foreign leagues; Yet, while she saunters idle and alone, Her careless eyes are on the paper thrown. As some gay youth, whom sportive friends engage To view the surious ourang in his cage, If while amus'd he sees the monster grin, And trusts too careless to the bolts within, If the sly beast, as near the grate he draws, Tear him unguarded with projected paws, Starts at the wound, and feels his bosom thrill With pain and wonder at the sudden ill: So did Serena start, so wildly gaze, In such mixt pangs of anguish and amaze, Feeling the wound which Seandal had design'd To lacerate her mild and modest mind. Startled, as one who from electric wire Unheeding catches unsuspected fire, She reads, then almost doubts that she has read, And thinks some vision hovers round her head. Now, her fixt eye some striking words confine, And now she darts it thrice thro' every line; Nor could amazement more her senses shake, Had every letter been a gorgon's snake. Now rising indignation takes its turn, And her flush'd cheeks with tingling blushes burn, With restless motion and with many a frown, Thro' the wide room she paces up and down: Now, musing, makes a momentary stand, The fatal paper fluttering in her hand. So the shy bird, by cruel sportsmen sprung, And by their random fire severely stung, Scar'd, not disabled, by the distant wound, Now trembling flies, now skims along the ground, Now vainly tries, in some sequester'd spot, From her gor'd breast to shake the galling shot. Ye tender nymphs! whose kindling souls would flame, Touch'd, like Serena's, by injurious blame, O let your quick and kindred spirits form A vivid picture of the mental storm In which she labour'd, and whose force to paint The Muse's strongest tints appear too faint; In sympathetic thought her suffering see! But O, for ever from such wrongs be free! Her faithful girdle try'd its power to save, And oft a monitory impulse gave; Still unregarded, still unfelt, it prest With useless energy her heaving breast, Her mind, forgetful of the magic zone, Full of the burning shaft by Scandal thrown, With blended notes of sorrow and disdain, Thus in disorder'd language vents its pain:— “Had malice dar'd my honour to defame, The self-refuted lie had lost its aim: But here the world, deceiv'd by sland'rous art, Must think Serena has a venal heart.” A venal heart! at that detested sound, In swelling anguish her sunk voice was drown'd. Now was a fearful crisis of her fate: Distended now by passion's growing weight, And for its mistress fill'd with conscious dread, The magic girdle crack'd thro' every thread, And snapp'd perchance by Scandal's force accurst, From her full heart the guardian zone had burst, And, spite of all the virtues of the fair, The spell of happiness had sunk in air, But that Sophrosyne, whose friendly fear Timely foresaw this trial too severe, An early succour gain'd from secret love, From the fell kite to snatch the falling dove. As Nature studies, in her wide domain, To blend some antidote with every bane; Thus her kind aid the friendly power contriv'd, That, from the quarter whence the wound arriv'd, There flow'd, the anguish of that wound to calm, A soothing, soft, and medicinal balm. As in her agitated hand the fair Wav'd the loose paper with disorder'd air, In capitals she saw Serena flame: She blush'd, she shudder'd, as she view'd the name; Her ready fears subside in new surprise, And eager thus she reads with lighten'd eyes: “Go, faithful sonnet, to Serena say What charms peculiar in her features reign: A stranger, whom her glance may ne'er survey, Pays her this tribute in no flattering strain. Tell her, the bard, in beauty's wide domain, Has seen a virgin cheek as richly glow, A bosom, where the blue meandring vein Sheds as soft lustre thro' the lucid snow, Eyes, that as brightly flash with joy and youth, And locks, that like her own luxuriant flow: Then say, for then she cannot doubt thy truth, That the wide earth no female form can show Where nature's legend so distinctly tells, In this fair shrine a fairer spirit dwells.” With curious wonder the reviving maid View'd this fond homage to her beauty paid; A second glance o'er every line she cast, And half pronounc'd and half suppress'd the last, While modest pleasure, and ingenuous pride, Her burning cheek with deeper crimson dy'd. O Praise! thy language was by heaven design'd As manna to the faint bewilder'd mind: Beauty and diffidence, whose hearts rejoice In the kind comsort of thy cheering voice, In this wild wood of life, wert thou not nigh, Must, like the wandering babes, lie down and die: But thy sweet accents wake new vital powers, And make this thorny path a path of flowers: As oil on ocean's troubled waters spread, Smooths the rough billow to a level bed, The soothing rhyme thus soften'd into rest The painful tumult of Serena's breast. Now, to herself restor'd, the conscious maid The lurking fiend's insidious snare survey'd; Her nerves, with grateful trepidation, own A slighter pressure from the faithful zone; And in fond thought she breathes a thankful prayer For her ætherial guardian's constant care; Yet with a keen desire her bosom glow'd, To hear from whom the gentle sonnet flow'd; But kind Sophrosyne, who watch'd unseen, To shield her votary from the wiles of Spleen, As friendly love had fixt a future time, When to reveal the secret of the rhyme, Strove till that hour her fancy to restrain, Nor let her anxious wishes rise to pain. As gaiety's fresh tide began to roll, Fast in the swelling channel of her soul, The good old knight descends, tho' eager, slow, The gout still tingling in his tender toe; And now, paternal salutations past, His eyes he keenly on the paper cast, While his sweet daughter, with attentive grace, Before him flies his ready cup to place; For tea and politics alternate share, In friendly rivalship, his morning care. Tho' smooth as oil the knight's good-humour flows, When the mild breeze of pleasant fortune blows, Yet, quick to catch the casual sparks of ire, Like oil it kindles into mounting fire; And fiercely now his flaming spirit blaz'd, While on those galling words he wildly gaz'd, Whose force had almost work'd into a storm The gentler elements in beauty's form. As the sarcastic sentence caught his view, Back from the board his elbow-chair he drew, And, by sharp stings of sudden fury prick'd, Far from his foot his gouty stool he kick'd. Fierce as Achilles, by Atrides stung, He pour'd the stream of vengeance from his tongue; But ah, those angry threats he deign'd to speak, Had sounds, alas! far differing from the Greek. Rage from his lips in legal language broke; Of juries and of damages he spoke, And on the printer's law-devoted head He threaten'd deep revenge in terms most dread; Terms, that with pain the ear of beauty pierce, And oaths too rough to harmonize in verse. While thus the good old knight, with passion hot, His toast neglected, and his tea forgot, The discord of the drama to increase, Now prim Penelope assails her niece; For, as Sir Gilbert now, with choler dumb, Points her the period with his angry thumb, “Ah! brother,” cries the stiff, malignant crone, (Her sharp eye swiftly thro' the sentence thrown) “Scandal could never rise to heights like this, But from the manners of each modern miss; Had but my niece, less giddy and more grave, Observ'd the prudent hints I often gave—” The honest knight her vile conclusion saw, And quick curtail'd it with a testy “Pshaw!” Mean while the gentle maid, who heard the taunt, Survey'd without a frown her prudish aunt: Far other thoughts employ'd her softer mind, To one sweet purpose all her soul inclin'd; How she might close th' unpleasant scene, how best Restore good humour to her father's breast. Her airy guardian with delight survey'd These tender wishes in the lovely maid, And, to accomplish what her heart desir'd, Trains of new thought above her age inspir'd. As Venus on her son's enlighten'd face Shed richer charms, and more attractive grace, When, issuing forth from the dissolving cloud, His bright form burst on the admiring crowd: So kind Sophrosyne, unseen, supplies A livelier radiance to Serena's eyes; And, ere she speaks, to captivate her sire, Touches her lips with patriotic fire. It chanc'd, that, toss'd upon a vacant chair, A volume of that wit lay near the fair, Whose value, try'd by fashion's varying touch, Once rose too high, and now is sunk too much; The book, which fortune plac'd within her reach, Contain'd, O Chesterfield, the liberal speech In which thy spirit, like an Attic sage, Strove to defend the violated stage From fetters basely forg'd by ministerial rage. From this the nymph her useful lesson took, And thus began, reclining on the book:— “If on this noble lord we may rely, Scandal is but a speck on Freedom's eye; And public spirit, then, will rather bear The casual pain it gives by growing there, Than, by a rash attempt to move it thence, Hazard the safety of a precious sense, And, by the efforts of a vain desire, Rob this life-darting eye of all its fire. Tho' the soft breast of innocence may smart, By cruel calumny's corroding dart, Yet would she rather ache in every nerve, And bear those pangs she knows not to deserve, Much rather than be made a senseless tool, To aid the frenzy of tyrannic rule, Or forge one dangerous bolt for power to aim At sacred Liberty's superior frame.”— As ancient chiefs were wont of old to gaze, With eyes of tender awe and fond amaze On the fair priestess of the Delphic fane, When first she utter'd her prophetic strain, Entranc'd in wonder, thus Sir Gilbert view'd His child, yet more inspir'd, who thus pursu'd: “For me, I own, these lines, with gall replete, Shot thro' my simple heart a sudden heat; But happier thoughts my rising rage represt, And turn'd the pointless insult to a jest: And O! should Slander still new wrath awake, Still may my father, for his daughter's sake, Disdain the vengeance of litigious strife, And let Serena's answer be—her life!” She ended with a smile, whose magic flame Shot youthful vigour thro' her father's frame: His age, his anger, and his gout, are fled; “Enchanting girl!” with tears of joy, he said, “Enchanting girl!” twice echoed from his tongue, As, speaking, from his elbow-chair he sprung, “Come to thy father's arms!—By Heaven, thou art His own true offspring, and a Whig in heart.” He spoke; and his fond arms around her curl'd With proud grasp, seeming to infold the world. Her conscious heart she feels with triumph beat, And joys to find that triumph is compleat; For stiff Penelope, who near them stood, “Albeit unused to the melting mood,” Squeez'd from her eye-lid one reluctant tear, And soften'd with a smile her brow severe; But 'twas a smile of such a gloomy grace, As lighten'd once upon Alecto's face, When Orpheus past her, leading back to life, From Pluto's regions, his recover'd wife, When love connubial, join'd to music's spell, Moisten'd with tender joy the eyes of hell. Far other smiles, with pleasure's softest air, Gild the gay features of the youthful fair: She looks like sportive Spring, when her young charms Wind round her hoary sire's reluctant arms, And, by a frolic infantine embrace, Banish the rugged frown from Winter's face. Thro' the long day she felt the glowing tide Of exultation thro' her bosom glide; And oft she wish'd for slow-approaching night, To hold sweet converse with her guardian sprite. At length the hour approach'd her heart desir'd, And, in her lonely chamber now retir'd, Her tender fancy gave the fondest scope To ardent gratitude and eager hope. “Dear airy being!” (the soft nymph exclaim'd) “Whose power can break the spell that Spleen has fram'd, Can, by the waving of thy viewless wing, O'er darkest forms a golden radiance fling, And make, in minds by sorriest thoughts perplext, This moment's grief the triumph of the next; I bless thy succour in each trial past; Be present still, and save me in the last!” Thus, with her lovely eyes devoutly fixt, Where rays of hope, and fear, and reverence mixt, The tender fair her faithful guard addrest, Then with her cheek her downy pillow prest; But long her wakeful lids refuse to close, For curiosity dispels repose. Her busy mind the mystic veil would pierce, That hides the author of the pleasing verse; Her lips involuntary catch the chime, And half articulate the soothing rhyme, Till weary thought no longer watch can keep, But sinks reluctant in the folds of sleep. END OF THE FOURTH CANTO. CANTO V. Why art thou fled, O blest poetic time, When Fancy wrought the miracles of rhyme; When, darting from her star-encircled throne, Her poet's eye commanded worlds unknown; When, by her fiat made a mimic god, He saw existence waiting on his nod, And at his pleasure into being brought New shadowy hosts, the vassals of his thought, In joy's gay garb, in terror's dread array, Darker than night, and brighter than the day; Who, at his bidding, thro' the wilds of air, Rais'd willing mortals far from earthly care, And led them wondering thro' his wide domain, Beyond the bounds of nature's narrow reign; While their rapt spirits, in the various flight, Shook with sucessive thrills of new delight? Return, sweet season, grac'd with fiction's flowers, Let not cold system cramp thy genial powers! Shall mild Morality, in garb uncouth, The housewife garb of plain and homely truth, Robb'd by stern Method of her rosy crown, Chill her faint votaries by a wintry frown? No; thou sweet friend of man, as suits thee best, Shine forth in Fable's rich-embroider'd vest! O make my verse thy vehicle, thy arms, To spread o'er social life thy potent charms! And thou, Sophrosyne, mysterious sprite! If haply I may trace thy steps aright, Roving thro' paths untrod by mortal feet, To paint for human eyes thy heavenly seat, Shed on my soul some portion of that power, Which sav'd Serena in the trying hour, To bear those trials, which, however hard, As bards all tell us, may befall the bard; The fop's pert jest, the critic's frown severe, Learning's proud cant, with envy's artful sneer, And, the vext poet's last and worst disgrace, His cold blank bookseller's rhyme-freezing face. Hence! ye dark omens, that to Spleen belong, Ye shall not check the current of my song, While Beauty's lovely race, for whom I sing, Fire my warm hand to strike the ready string. As quiet now her lightest mantle laid O'er the still senses of the sleeping maid, Her nightly visitant, her faithful guide, Descends in all her empyrean pride; That fairy shape no more she deigns to wear, Whose light foot smooths the furrow plough'd by care In mortal faces, while her tiny spear Gives a kind tingle to the caution'd ear. Now, in her nobler shape, of heavenly size, She strikes her votary's soul with new surprise. Jove's favourite daughter, arm'd in all his powers, Appear'd less brilliant to th' attending Hours, When, on the golden car of Juno rais'd, In heavenly pomp the queen of battles blaz'd: With all her lustre, but without the dread Which from her arm the frowning gorgon shed, Sophrosyne descends, with guardian love, To waft her gentle ward to worlds above. From her fair brow a radiant diadem Rose in twelve stars, and every separate gem Shot magic rays, of virtue to controul Some passion hostile to the human soul. Round her sweet form a robe of æther flow'd, And in a wonderous car the smiling Spirit rode; Firm as pure ivory, it charm'd the sight With finer polish and a softer white. The hand of beauty, with an easy swell, Scoop'd the free concave like a bending shell; And on its rich exterior, art display'd The triumphs of the Power the car convey'd. Here, in celestial tints, surpassing life, Sate lovely Gentleness, disarming Strife; There, young Affection, born of tender Thought, In rosy chains the fiercer passions caught; Ambition, with his sceptre snapt in twain, And Avarice, scorning what his chests contain. Round the tame vulture flies the fearless dove; Soft Innocence embraces playful Love; And laughing Sport, the frolic child of Air, Buries in flowers the sinking form of Care. These figures, pencil'd with a touch so light, That every image seem'd an heavenly sprite, Breathe on the car; whose sight-enchanting frame Four wheels sustain, of pale and purple flame; For no fleet animals, to earth unknown, Bear thro' ætherial fields this flying throne. As by the subtle electrician's skill, Globes seem to fly, obedient to his will; So these four circles of instinctive fire Move by the impulse of their queen's desire. Mount or descend by her directing care, Or rest, supported by the buoyant air. Now, springing from her car, that hovering staid High in the chamber of the sleeping maid, The goddess, with a voice divinely clear, Breath'd these kind accents in her votary's ear:— “Come, my fair champion, who so well hast fought The useful battles of contentious thought; To aid thy gentle spirit to sustain The final conflict of thy destin'd pain, View the rewards that, in my realms of bliss, Wait the sweet victor in such war as this! So haply may thy mind, with strength renew'd, The dark devices of the fiend elude; By one blest effort seal thy triumphs past, And gain thy promis'd guerdon in the last.” As thus she spake, her heavenly arms embrac'd, And in the car the conscious maiden plac'd. Quick at her wish the flaming wheels ascend, No clouds impede them, wheresoe'er they bend. As thro' the empire of the winds they rush'd, The winds were all in mute submission hush'd: And now Serena, from th' exalted car, Look'd down, astonish'd, on each sinking star; Flying o'er lucid orbs, whose distant light Yet has not reach'd the scope of human sight; And now, not distant from the bounds of space, The guardian sprite suspends their rapid race; And, while in deep amaze the nymph admires The circling meteors' inoffensive fires, Pleas'd at her wonder, the mild Power addrest, With kind intelligence, her earthly guest:— “Of those three orbs, that in yon crystal sphere A separate system in themselves appear, The last, whose luminous and steady form Shines softly bright, and moderately warm, Contains my palace, and the gentle train Whom I have wasted to this pure domain. At equal distance my dominions lie From these two larger worlds, more near thine eye: Observe their difference as our wheels advance, And passing, take of each a transient glance.” So speaking, to the grosser globe she sprung, Her car suspended o'er its surface hung, In heavy air; for round this orb was roll'd A circling vapour, dull, and damp, and cold. “Here,” says Sophrosyne, “those beings dwell, Who wanted soul to act or ill or well; Who saunter'd thoughtless thro' their mortal time, Without a care, a virtue, or a crime; Here still they saunter, in this languid scene: But pass the dozing crowd, and mark their queen.” And now, slow riding on a tortoise' back, Her features lifeless, and each fibre slack, Full in their view the nymph Indifference came; The quick Serena soon perceiv'd her name; For, as in solemn creeping state she rode, In her lax hand she held fair Greville's ode. Ne'er did the muse from her sweet treasure cull Incense so precious for a Power so dull. Still as she mov'd along her even way, The heavy goddess try'd to read the lay; But at each pause her inattentive eye Stray'd from the paper, which she held awry; Nor could her lips a single line repeat, Tho' the soft verse, most ravishingly sweet, Thro' Time's just ear will lasting pleasure spread, And charm the poppy from Oblivion's head. Thus, like a city mayor, whose heavy barge Steers its dull progress at the public charge, This Power, so cumber'd by her empire's weight, Makes her slow circuit round her sluggish state. Around her, tribes of rambling sceptics crawl, Tho' moving, dubious if they move at all. Before her, languid Pomp, her marshal, creeps, Whose hand her banner half unfolded keeps: Its quaint device her dull dominion spoke— An eagle, numb'd by the torpedo's stroke. “Enough of scenes so foreign to thy soul,” Sophrosyne exclaim'd; “from this dark goal Pass we to regions opposite to this.” She spoke; and, darting o'er the wide abyss, Her car, like lightning in soft flashes hurl'd, Shot to the confines of a clearer world. Now lovelier views the virgin's mind absorb; For now they hover'd o'er a lucid orb. Here the soft air, luxuriantly warm, Imparts new lustre to Serena's form: Her eyes with more expressive radiance speak, And richer roses open on her cheek. Here, as she gaz'd, she felt in every vein A blended thrill of pleasure and of pain; Yet every object glittering in her view, Her quick regard with soft attraction drew. Sophrosyne, who saw the gentle fair Lean o'er these confines with peculiar care, Smil'd at the tender interest she display'd, And spoke regardful of the pensive maid; “Well may'st thou bend o'er this congenial sphere; For Sensibility is sovereign here. Thou seest her train of sprightly damsels sport, Where the soft spirit holds her rural court; But fix thine eye attentive to the plain, And mark the varying wonders of her reign.” As thus she spoke, she pois'd her airy seat High o'er a plain exhaling every sweet; For round its precincts all the flowers that bloom Fill'd the delicious air with rich perfume; And in the midst a verdant throne appear'd, In simplest form by graceful fancy rear'd, And deck'd with flowers; not such whose flaunting dyes Strike with the strongest tint our dazzled eyes; But those wild herbs that tenderest fibres bear, And shun th' approaches of a damper air. Here stood the lovely ruler of the scene, And beauty, more than pomp, announc'd the queen. The bending snow-drop, and the briar-rose, The simple circle of her crown compose; Roses of every hue her robe adorn, Except th' insipid rose without a thorn. Thro' her thin vest her heighten'd beauties shine; For earthly gauze was never half so sine. Of that enchanting age her figure seems, When smiling nature with the vital beams Of vivid youth, and pleasure's purple flame, Gilds her accomplish'd work, the female frame, With rich luxuriance tender, sweetly wild, And just between the woman and the child. Her fair left arm around a vase she flings, From which the tender plant mimosa springs: Towards its leaves, o'er which she fondly bends, The youthful fair her vacant hand extends With gentle motion, anxious to survey How far the feeling fibres own her sway: The leaves, as conscious of their queen's command, Successive fall at her approaching hand; While her soft breast with pity seems to pant, And shrinks at every shrinking of the plant. Around their sovereign, on the verdant ground, Sweet airy forms in mystic measures bound. The mighty master of the revel, Love, In notes more soothing than his mother's dove, Prompts the soft strain that melting virgins sing, Or sportive trips around the frolic ring, Coupling, with radiant wreaths of lambent fire, Fair fluttering Hope and rapturous Desire. Unnumber'd damsels different charms display, Pensive with bliss, or in their pleasures gay; And the wide prospect yields one touching sight Of tender, yet diversified delight. But, the bright triumphs of their joy to check, In the clear air there hangs a dusky speck; It swells—it spreads—and rapid, as it grows, O'er the gay scene a chilling shadow throws. The soft Serena, who beheld its flight, Suspects no evil from a cloud so light; For harmless round her the thin vapours wreath, Not hiding from her view the scene beneath; But ah! too soon, with pity's tender pain, She saw its dire effect o'er all the plain: Sudden from thence the sounds of anguish flow, And joy's sweet carols end in shrieks of woe: The wither'd flowers are fall'n, that bloom'd so fair, And poison all the pestilential air. From the rent earth dark demons force their way, And make the sportive revellers their prey. Here gloomy Terror, with a shadowy rope, Seems, like a Turkish mute, to strangle Hope; There jealous Fury drowns in blood the fire That sparkled in the eye of young Desire; And lifeless Love lets merciless Despair From his crush'd frame his bleeding pinions tear. But pangs more cruel, more intensely keen, Wound and distract their sympathetic queen: With fruitless tears she o'er their misery bends; From her sweet brow the thorny rose she rends, And, bow'd by grief's insufferable weight, Frantic she curses her immortal state: The soft Serena, as this curse she hears, Feels her bright eye suffus'd with kindred tears; And her kind breast, where quick compassion swell'd, Shar'd in each bitter suffering she beheld. The guardian Power survey'd her lovely grief, And spoke in gentle terms of mild relief: “For this soft tribe thy heaviest fear dismiss, And know their pains are transient as their bliss: Rapture and agony, in nature's loom, Have form'd the changing tissue of their doom; Both interwoven with so nice an art, No power can tear the twisted threads apart: Yet happier these, to Nature's heart more dear, Than the dull offspring in the torpid sphere, Where her warm wishes, and affections kind, Lose their bright current in the stagnant mind. Here grief and joy so suddenly unite, That anguish serves to sublimate delight.” She spoke; and, ere Serena could reply, The vapour vanish'd from the lucid sky; The nymphs revive, the shadowy fiends are fled, The new-born flowers a richer fragrance shed; The gentle ruler of the changeful land, Smiling, resum'd her symbol of command; Replac'd the roses of her regal wreath, Still trembling at the thorns that lurk beneath: But, to her wounded subjects quick to pay The tender duties of imperial sway, Their wants she succour'd, they her wish obey'd, And all recover'd, by alternate aid; While, on the lovely queen's enchanting face, Departed sorrow's faint and fainter trace, Gave to each touching charm a more attractive grace. Now, laughing Sport, from the enlighten'd plain, Clear'd with quick foot the vestiges of pain; The gay scene grows more beautifully bright, Than when it first allur'd Serena's sight, Still her fond eyes o'er all the prospect range, Flashing sweet pleasure at the blissful change: Her curious thoughts with fond attachment burn, Yet more of this engaging land to learn. She finds the chief attendants of the queen, Sweet females, wasted from our human scene; But, as it chanc'd, while all the realm reviv'd, A spirit masculine from earth arriv'd: Two airy guides conduct the gentle shade; Genius, in robes of braided flames array'd, And a fantastic nymph, in manners nice, Profusely deck'd with many an odd device; Sister of him, whose luminous attire Flashes with unextinguishable fire; Like him in features, in her look as wild, And Singularity by mortals stly'd. The eager queen, and all her smiling court, Surround the welcome shade in gentle sport; For in their new associate all rejoice, All pant to hear the accents of his voice. Tho' o'er his frame th' Armenian robe was flung, The pleasing stranger spoke the Gallic tongue; But in that language his enchanting art Inspir'd new energy, that seiz'd the heart; In terms so eloquent, so sweetly bold, A story of disastrous love he told, Convuls'd with sympathy, the list'ning train, At every pause, with dear delicious pain, Intreat him to renew the fascinating strain. And now Serena, with suspended breath, Listen'd, and caught the tale of Julia's death; And quick she cries, ere tears had time to flow, “Blest be this hour! for now I see Rousseau.” Fondly she gaz'd, till the enchanting sound In such a potent spell her spirit bound, That, lost in sweet illusion, she forgot The promis'd scenes of the sublimer spot; Till now her mild remembrancer, whose care Stray'd not a moment from the mortal fair, Rous'd her rapt mind, preparing her to meet The brighter wonders of her blissful seat; While her instinctive car's obedient frame Now upward rose, like undulating flame. As when some victor on the watery world, Bright honour gilding all his sails unfurl'd, Steers into port, while to the laughing sky His streamers tell his triumph as they fly; Expecting thousands line the crowded strand, Swell the glad voice, or wave the joyous hand, Pressing to view the sight their vows implor'd, And hail their glory and their strength restor'd: So the blest beings of this smiling scene Flock'd round the car of their returning queen. The radiant car, from which they now alight, Careful she gives to a selected sprite, A nymph of snowy vest and lovely frame, Fidelity her fair and spotless name; Then, happy to review her hallow'd home, Leads her sweet guest to her celestial dome. Gentlest of powers! for every purpose fit, To strengthen wisdom, and embellish wit;— Thou, whose soft arts, possess'd by thee alone, Can give to virtue's voice a sweeter tone; Allay the frost of age, or fire of youth, And lend attraction to severest truth; Improve e'en beauty by thy graceful ease, Or teach deformity herself to please;— Inspire the bard, whose just ambition pants To guide weak mortals to thy heavenly haunts! Grant him, in notes that, like thy soft controul, Allure attention, and possess the soul; Grant him to show, in luminous display, The mystic wonders of thy secret sway! Now, at the sight of the presiding power, Wide spread the gates of a stupendous tower, On whose firm height, commanding nature's bound, The faithful warder of the fort they found, Wakeful Intelligence, a trusty sprite, Whose eyes are piercing as the solar light, And ever on the watch to sound alarm, If aught of dusky hue, portending harm, Should, in defiance of her mandate, dare Approach the palace of th' imperial fair. Within his ward, magnificently great, Lies the rich armoury that guards her state. Here stands Conviction's strong and lucid spear, Whose touch annihilates suspense and fear; Here, Truth's unsullied adamantine shield, Which, save Sophrosyne, no power can wield; And Reason's trenchant blade of blazing steel, Its edge and polish form'd by friendly zeal; And, not less sure their destin'd mark to hit, Pointed by virtue's hand, the shafts of Wit; And Ridicule's strong bolt, whose stunning blow Lays towering vice and fearless folly low. Here too the goddess kept, in mystic state, Those sweet rewards that on her champions wait, Guerdons more precious than triumphant palms:— The glance of gratitude for mental alms, Peace's soft kiss, and reconcilement's tear, And smiles of sympathy, are treasur'd here. These precincts past, now hand in hand they came To the rich fabric of majestic frame; Instinct with joy their sovereign to behold, The gates of massive adamant unfold; And, as the gently-moving valves unclose, Mysterious music from their motion flows; The airy notes thro' all the palace roam, And dulcet echoes fill the festive dome: A gorgeous hall amaz'd Serena's eyes, Compar'd to which, in splendor, strength, and size, The noblest works of which tradition sings, Judaic shrine, or seat of Memphian kings, Would seem more humble than the waxen cell In which the skilful bee is proud to dwell. Here sits a power, in whose angelic face Beauty is sweeten'd by maternal grace; Her radiant seat, surpassing mortal art, Supports an emblem of her liberal heart, A pelican, who rears her callow brood, And from her vitals seems to draw their food. Around this spirit flock a filial host, Who bless her empire, and her guidance boast. Here every science, all the arts attend, In her they hail their parent and their friend; Each to her presence brings the happy few, Whose dearest glory from her favour grew. Here, in her simple charms, with youthful fire, Proud to display the magic of her lyre, Soul-soothing Harmony presents her band: Beside her Orpheus and Amphion stand. Here, mild Philosophy, whose thoughtful frown Is sweetly shaded by her olive crown, (In all her Attic elegance array'd, Strong to convince, and gentle to persuade) To her, whose breath inspir'd his every rule, Leads the blest sire of the Socratic school. Each animating bard and moral sage, The heaven-taught minds of every clime and age, Who soften'd manners, and refin'd the soul, Flock to this presence, as to glory's goal; And, as the mother's heart, that yearns to bless The rival innocents that round her press, Delights to see them, as her love they share, Sport in her sight, and flourish by her care; Fondly responsive to their every call, Tender of each, and provident for all: So this sweet image of celestial grace, Who sits encircled by her lovely race, To every science vital strength imparts, And rears the circle of the social arts; With such solicitude she gives to each, Pow'rs of sublimer aim and wider reach. And now Sophrosyne, who near her prest, Thus spoke her title to her earthly guest:— “Behold the honour'd form, without whose aid My strength must vanish, and my glory fade! Source of my being, and my life's support! Eunoia call'd in this celestial court, Benevolence the name she bears on earth, The guard of weakness, and the friend of worth.” She ended: and the mild maternal form Embrac'd Serena with a smile as warm As the gay spirit Vegetation wears, When she to crown her favourite nymph prepares, When, pleas'd her flowery treasures to display, She pours them in the lap of youthful May. But how, Serena! how may human speech Thy heavenly raptures in this moment reach? If aught of earthly sentiment may vie With the pure joy these happy scenes supply, 'Tis when, unmixt with trouble and with pain, Love glides in secret thro' the glowing vein; When some fond youth, unconscious of its fire, Free from chill fear and turbulent desire, With every thought absorb'd in soft delight, Sees all creation in his fair-one's sight, And feels a blissful state without a name, Repose of soul with harmony of frame. So, plung'd in pleasure of the purest kind, Serena gaz'd on the maternal mind; Gaz'd till Sophrosyne's directing aid Thus summon'd to new sights th' obedient maid:— “Haste, my fair charge, for of this ample state, Tracts yet unseen thy visitation wait. The pressing hours forbid me to unfold Each separate province which these confines hold; But I will lead thee to that blissful crew, Whose kindred spirits best deserve thy view.” So speaking, her attentive guest she led Thro' scenes, that still increasing wonder bred. Where'er she trod, thro' all her gorgeous seat, Soft music echoed from beneath her feet: Passing a portal, on whose lucid stone Emblems of innocence and beauty shone, They reach a lawn with verdant lustre bright, And view the bowers of permanent delight. No fiery sun here forms a scorching noon, No baleful meteor gleams, no chilling moon: But, from a latent source, on soothing light, Whose constant rays repel the mist of night, Tho' tender, chearful, and tho' warm, serene, Gives lasting beauty to the lovely scene. No sensual thought this paradise profanes; For here tried excellence in triumph reigns, Benignant cares eternal joy supply, And bliss angelic beams in every eye. “In yonder groups,” the leading spirit cried, “My fav'rite females see, my fairest pride. The first in rank is that distinguish'd train, Whose strength of soul was tried by Hymen's chain: Tho' beauty blest their form, and love, their guide, Their nuptial band with happiest omens tied, Beauty and love, they felt, may lose the art To fix inconstant man's eccentric heart; Yet, conscious of their lord's neglected vow, No virtue frown'd outrageous on their brow, To keep returning tenderness aloof, By coarse upbraiding, and despis'd reproof: With sorrow smother'd in attraction's smile, They strove the sense of misery to beguile; And, from wild passion's perilous abyss, Lure the lost wanderer back to faithful bliss. See mild Octavia o'er this band preside, Voluptuous Antony's neglected bride, Whose feeling heart, with all a mother's care, Rear'd the young offspring of a rival fair. Far other trials rais'd yon lovely crew, Tho' in connubial scenes their merit grew: It was their chance, ere judgment was mature, When glittering toys the infant mind allure, Following their parents' avaricious rule, To wed, with hopes of bliss, a wealthy fool. When time remov'd delusion's veil by stealth, And show'd the drear vacuity of wealth; When sad experience prov'd the bitter fate Of beauty coupled to a senseless mate, These gentle wives still gloried to submit; These, tho' invited by alluring wit, Refus'd in paths of lawless joy to range, Nor murmur'd at the lot they could not change: But, with a lively sweetness, unopprest By a dull husband's lamentable jest, Their constant rays of gay good-humour spread A guardian glory round their idiot's head. The next in order are those lovely forms, Whose patience weather'd all paternal storms; By filial cares, the mind's unfailing test, Well have they earn'd these seats of blissful rest: They, unrepining at severe restraint, Peevish commands, and undeserv'd complaint; Bent with unwearied kindness to appease Each fancied want of querulous disease; Gave up those joys which youthful hearts engage, To watch the weakness of parental age. Turn to this chearful band; and mark in this, Spirits who justly claim my realms of bliss! Most lovely these! when judg'd by generous truth, Tho' beauty is not their's, nor blooming youth: For these are they, who, in life's thorny shade, Repin'd not at the name of ancient maid. No proud disdain, no narrowness of heart, Held them from Hymen's tempting rites apart; But fair discretion led them to withdraw From the priz'd honour of his proffer'd law; To quit the object of no hasty choice, In mild submission to a parent's voice; The valued lover with a sigh resign, And sacrifice delight at duty's shrine. With smiles they bore, from angry spleen exempt, Injurious mockery, and coarse contempt: 'Twas their's to clasp, each selfish care above, A sister's orphans with parental love, And all her tender offices supply, Tho' bound not by the strong maternal tie: 'Twas their's to bid intestine quarrels cease, And form the cement of domestic peace. No throbbing joy their spotless bosom fir'd, Save what benevolence herself inspir'd; No praise they sought, except that praise refin'd, Which the heart whispers to the worthy mind. Such are these gentle tribes, the happy few Who share the triumph to their victory due: Angelic aims their spotless minds employ, And fill their measure of unchequer'd joy. Behold! where some with generous ardour wait Around yon seer, who holds the book of fate; Those awful leaves with eager glance they turn, Thence with celestial zeal they fondly learn What dangers threaten, thro' the vale of earth, Their kindred pilgrims, ere they rise to birth: To earth they still invisibly descend, In that dark scene congenial minds defend, From pleasure's bud drive spleen's corroding worm, And in my votaries' heart my power confirm. Delights more calm yon listening band employ, Who deeply drink of intellectual joy. See them around that speaking nymph rejoice, Their pleasures varying with her varied voice! What graces in the sweet enthusiast glow! Repeating here whate'er she learns below. Memory her name, her charge o'er earth to flit, And cull the fairest flowers of human wit. Whatever Genius, in his happiest hour, Has penn'd, of moral grace and comic power, To warm the heart, the spells of Spleen unbind, And pour gay sunshine o'er the misty mind; Teach men to cherish their fraternal tie, And view kind nature with a filial eye; This active spirit catches in her flight, Skill'd to retain, and happy to recite. Here she delivers each bright work, and each Derives new beauty from her graceful speech. Warpt by no envy, by no love misled, Equal she holds the living and the dead; Alike rehearsing, as they claim their turn, The song of Anstey, and the tale of Sterne. But morning calls thee hence.—Yet one scene more, My fostering love shall lead thee to explore. This, thy last sight, with careful eyes survey, And mark th' extensive nature of my sway.” Thus with fond zeal the guardian Spirit said, And to new precincts of her palace led; The scene she enter'd of her richest state, Where on her voice the subject passions wait: Here rose a throne of living gems, so bright No breath could sully their benignant light; This, her immortal seat, the gracious guide Assum'd: her ward stood wondering at her side. Swift as they felt their ruling Power inthron'd, Ætherial beings, who her empire own'd, Crowded in glittering pomp the gorgeous scene, To pay their homage to their heavenly queen. First came chaste Love, whose sweet harmonious form Ne'er felt suspicion's soul-convulsing storm; No baleful arrow in his quiver lies, No blinding veil inwraps his sparkling eyes; There all the rays of varied joy unite, And jointly shed unspeakable delight. With him was Friendship, like a virgin drest, The soft asbestos form'd her simple vest, Whose wond'rous folds, in fiercest flames entire, Mock the vain ravage of consuming fire: Around this robe, a mystic chain she wore, Each golden link a star of diamonds bore; Force could not tear the finish'd work apart, Nor int'rest loose it by his subtlest art: But, strange to tell, if the presiding Power, Who to her favourite gave this precious dower, If kind Sophrosyne could fail to breathe Her vital virtue on this magic wreath, The parts must sever, faithless to their trust, The gold grow dross, and every diamond dust. These Valour follow'd, deck'd with verdant palm, Gracefully bold, majestically calm. A mingled troop succeed, with festive sound, Wisdom with olive, Wit with feathers crown'd; Here, hand in hand they move, no longer foes, Their charms increasing as their union grows; Pure spirits all, who hating mental strife, Exalt creation, and embellish life; All here attend, and, in their sovereign's praise, Their circling forms the song of glory raise. The blest Serena drinks, with ravish'd ear, The melting music of the tuneful sphere. Now in its close the soothing echoes roll O'er her rapt fancy, and intrance her soul; Her senses sink in soft oblivion's bands, Till faithful Jenny at her pillow stands, Recalls each mental and corporeal power, While she proclaims aloud the passing hour; And, in a voice expressive of surprise, Too shrill to seem the music of the skies, Informs the startled fair 'tis time to rise. END OF THE FIFTH CANTO. CANTO VI. Blest be the heart of sympathetic mould, Whatever form that gentle heart infold, Whose generous fibres with fond terror shake, When keen affliction threatens to o'ertake Young artless beauty, as alarm'd she strays Thro' the strange windings of this mortal maze! To such, Serena, be thy story known, Whose bosom best can make thy lot their own, And, kindly sharing in thy trials past, Attend with sweet anxiety the last. The hour approaches, the tremendous hour, In whose dark moments deeper perils lower; Still so inwrapt in pleasure's gay disguise, They lurk invisible to caution's eyes; And, unsuspected by the fair one, wait To cancel or confirm her blissful fate. Her lively mind with bright ideas stor'd, She takes her station at the breakfast-board; Still her soft soul the heavenly vision fills, And sweeter graces in her smile instils; New hopes of triumph glide thro' every nerve, And arm her glowing heart with firm reserve; Conscious the final trying chance impends, To bear its force her every power she bends; In her quick thought ambitious to presage How Spleen's dark agents may exert their rage, She ponders on what perils may befall, And fondly deems her mind a match for all. Ah, lovely nymph! this dangerous pride forego; Pride may betray—security's thy foe. While fancied prudence thus, a foreign guest, Sits doubly cherish'd in Serena's breast, Behold a billet her attention steal, No common arms compose its ample seal; Th' unfolding paper breathes a roseate scent, Sweet harbinger of joy, its kind intent. Of courteous Filligree it bears the name, Clear symptom of the peer's increasing flame! The gracious earl, lamenting pleasure lost, And fair Serena in her wishes crost, Has plann'd, in honour of the lovely maid, A fancied ball, a private masquerade, And supplicates her sire, with warm esteem, To smile indulgent on the festive scheme. All arts he uses to insure the grant, Nor leaves unask'd the eager maiden aunt. Quick at the sound Serena's glowing heart Throbs with gay hopes; but soon those hopes depart: Reflection, in her soul a faithful guard, The opening avenues of pleasure barr'd: She deem'd the plan of this delightful show, But the new ambush of her secret foe; The bliss too bright to realize, she guess'd, And chas'd th' idea from her guarded breast. While these discreet resolves her thought employ, Tranquil she triumphs o'er her smother'd joy. Not so the knight—to his parental eyes, In dazzling pomp delusive visions rise: That coronet, the object of his vow, He sees suspended o'er his daughter's brow; Eager he burns to snap the pendent thread, And fix the glory on his darling's head. Far wiser aims the ancient maiden caught, No empty gew-gaw flutters in her thought; But, while more keenly she applauds the plan, Her hope is solid and substantial man; Not for her infant niece, whose baby frame She holds unfit for Hymen's holy flame; But for her riper self, whose strength may bear The heaviest burden of connubial care. Tho' different phantoms dance before their sight, Niece, aunt, and father, in one wish unite, To join the banquet is their common choice, The business past with no dissenting voice; And the warm sire, in whom ambition burn'd, A note of grateful courtesy return'd: His billet seal'd, the glad good-humour'd knight Launch'd forth, like Nestor, on his youthful might:— “O could I now, in spite of age, retain That active vigour, and that sprightly vein, Which led me once the lively laugh to raise Among the merrier wits of former days, When rival beauties would around me throng, And gay ridottos listen to my song! Such were I now, as on the festive night, When Ch—h's charms amaz'd the public sight; When the kind fair one, in a veil so thin That the clear gauze was but a lighter skin, Mask'd like a virgin just prepar'd to die, Gave her plump beauties to each greedy eye! On that fam'd night (for then with frolic fire Youth fill'd my heart, and humour strung my lyre), Pleas'd in the sunshine of her smile to bask, I danc'd around her in a devil's mask; And idly chanted an infernal ode, In praise of all this female tempter show'd. The jocund crowd, who throng'd with me to gaze, Extoll'd my unpremeditated lays, And Sport, who still of this old revel brags, ???? ???, ??????? ?? ??????. See Nestor's speech in the 11th Iliad.Styl'd her the first of maids, and me of wags. Then a light devil, now, reduc'd to limp, I am but fit to play the hag-born imp; Still, not to cross the frolic of this ball, Still as the tortoise Caliban I'll crawl, And if with gout my burning ankles flinch, I'll call it Prospero's tormenting pinch; Still in this shape I'll show them what I am: And Pen. shall go as Sycorax my dam.” So spoke the knight; and spoke with so much weight, The listening females saw his word was fate; For ne'er did Jove with so resolv'd a brow To smiling Love his joyous scheme avow, When he concerted, for his special mirth, A masquerading on the stage of earth, And of the swan's soft plume, or bull's rough hair, Order'd the fancy-dress he chose to wear. From whence let sapient antiquarians show The ancient use of masquerades below. Serena smil'd to see this joyous fire Infuse new youth in her determin'd fire; But mute Penelope, with half a sigh, “With one auspicious and one dropping eye,” Heard the firm knight his fixt resolve impart, Tickling at once and torturing her heart. The ball she relish'd, but abhorr'd the task To hide her beauties in a beldam's mask: Miranda's name would better suit her plan, A simple maiden, not afraid of man; But us'd, alas! her brother's law to feel, She knows that law admits not of repeal. Trusting her charms will any garb enrich, She deigns to take the habit of a witch. Never did sorceress in the shades of night Try to illuminate a filthy sprite With fonder efforts, or with worse success, Than Pen. now labour'd, in this wayward dress, To give the sprightly show of living truth To the poor ghost of her departed youth. As witches o'er their magic cauldron bend, Anxious to see their menial imps ascend; So in her glass the ancient maiden pries, And dreams new graces in her person rise. No such delights, whose dear delusions please, The mild Serena in her mirror sees; She, at whose toilet beauty's latent queen Attends, enchanted with her filial mien, And o'er her favourite's unconscious face Breathes her own roseate glow and vivid grace. She hastes her glittering garments to adjust, With all the modest charms of sweet distrust, Doubting that beauty, which she doubts alone, Which dazzles every eye except her own. The native diffidence which sway'd her mind, Now feels new terrors with its own combin'd; The robes of Ariel to the nymph recall Those disappointments that may yet befall; As her fair hands the gauze or tissue touch, They fondly warn her not to hope too much. She feels the friendly counsel they impart, And caution reigns protector of her heart. The fateful evening comes—the coach attends, And first the gouty Caliban ascends; Then, in deformity's well-suited pride, Sour Sycorax is station'd by his side; And last, with sportive smiles, divinely sweet, Light Ariel perches on the vacant seat. Fancy now paints the scene of pleasure near, Yet fluttering gaiety is check'd by fear. Her wish to view the festive sight runs high; But the fond nymph remembers, with a sigh, From hope's keen hand the cup of joy may slip, And fall untasted, though it reach the lip. As the fine artist, whose nice toils aspire To fame eternal by encaustic fire; If he, with grief, has seen the faithless heat Mar the rich labour it should make compleat, When next his hands, with trembling care, confide To the fierce element his pencil's pride, Watches unceasing the pernicious flame, Terror and hope contending in his frame, While his fair work the dangerous fire sustains, Feels it in all his sympathetic veins, And at each trivial sound that chance may cause, Hears the gem crack, and sees its cruel flaws: With such solicitude the panting maid Past the long street, of every noise afraid. Now, while around her rival flambeaus flare, And the coach rattles thro' the crowded square, She fears some dire mischance must yet befall, Some demon snatch her from the promis'd ball; And dreams no trial more severe than this, So bright she figures the new scene of bliss: Yet, horrid as it seems, her heart is bent To bear e'en this, and bear it with content. But, whirl'd at length within the porter's gate, She thinks what perils at the ball may wait; And, as she now alights, the fluttering fair Invokes her guardian to protect her there, Till thoughts of danger, thoughts of caution, fly Before the magic blaze that meets her eye. Th' advancing nymph, at every step she takes, Pants with amazement, doubtful if she wakes; Far as her eyes the glittering scene command, 'Tis all enchantment, all a fairy land; No vestiges of modern pomp appear, No modern melody salutes her ear: With Moorish notes the echoing mansion rings, And its transmuted form to fancy brings The rich See the views of this palace in Swinburn's Travels. Alhambra of the Moorish kings. The peer, who keenly thirsts for fashion's praise, To gild his revel with no common rays, Summon'd his modish architect, whose skill Can all the wishes of caprice fulfil. His genius, equal to the wildest task, Gave to the house itself a Gothic mask. The chaplain, that no guest might feel neglect, As a magician of the Arab sect, Wav'd a presiding wand throughout the ball, And well provided for the wants of all. The peer himself, his prowess to evince, Shines in the semblance of a Moorish prince; And round the brilliant mimic hero wait All pomp and circumstance of Moorish state: Thro' all his splendid dome no eye could find Aught unembellish'd, save the master's mind. There, tho' represt by courtesy's controul, Lurks the low mover of the little soul, Mean vanity; whose slave can never prove The heart-refining flame of genuine love. While her cold joys his abject mind amuse, His thoughts are busied on connubial views. His house compleat, its decorations plac'd By the sure hand of fashionable taste, He only wants, to crown his modish life, That last and finest moveable—a wife. She too must prove, to fix his coy desire, Such as the eye of fashion will admire. His ball is but a jury, to decide Upon the merit of his fancied bride. If sweet Serena, on this signal night, Shines the first idol of the public sight; If gallantry's fixt eyes pronounce her fair, By the sure sign of one unceasing stare; And if, prophetic of her nobler doom, Each rival beauty shudders at her bloom; The die is cast—he weds—the point is clear; She cannot slight the vows of such a peer. Thus argued in his mind the festive earl, And, lest he lightly chuse an awkward girl, Wisely conven'd, on this important case, Each fashionable judge of female grace. Here beaux esprits in various figures lurk, Of Jew and Gentile, Bramin, Tartar, Turk; But of the manly masks, a youthful bard Seem'd most to challenge beauty's soft regard: Adorn'd with native elegance, he wore, In simplest form, the minstrel dress of yore: They call him Edwin, who around him throng, Edwin, immortaliz'd in Beattie's song; And, sooth to say, within a comely frame, He bore a heart that answer'd to the name; For this neat habit deck'd a generous youth, Of gentlest manners, and sincerest truth. Tho' on his birth propitious fortune smil'd, No proud parental folly spoil'd the child; And genius, more beneficently kind, Blest with superior wealth his manly mind. Of years he barely counted twenty-one; But, like a brilliant morn, his opening life begun. Fain would the muse on this her votary dwell, And fully paint the youth she loves so well; His figure's charms, the music of his tongue, What nymphs his lays allur'd, what lays he sung: But higher cares her rambling song controul; Serena's perils summon all her soul; For Spleen, ambitious to exert her force, Conscious this trial is her last resource, Most keenly bent on her pernicious task, Has shifted round the ball from mask to mask, Watching the moment, with infernal care, To form with deepest art her final snare, And manacle the mind of the unguarded fair. It comes, the moment that must fix her lot, By her, ah thoughtless maid! by her forgot; Tho' the light Hours, e'en in their frolic ring, Trembling perceive the fearful chance they bring, And, shuddering at the nymph's terrific state, Seem anxious to suspend her doubtful fate. Now social ease the place of sport supplied, The hot oppressive mask was thrown aside, And beauty shone reveal'd in all her blushing pride. Superior still in features as in form, With admiration flush'd, with pleasure warm, The gay Serena every eye allur'd; The hearts her figure won her face secur'd: A tender sweetness still the nymph maintain'd, And modesty o'er all her graces reign'd. Well might her soul to brilliant hopes incline, A thousand youths had call'd her charms divine; A thousand friends had whisper'd in her ear, That fate had mark'd her for the festive peer. Her youthful fancy, tho' by pomp amus'd, Wish'd not those offers, which her heart refus'd: That tender heart, by no vain pride possest, With indecisive trembling shook her breast, Like a young bird, that, fluttering in the air, Wishes to build her nest, yet knows not where. The busy earl, his puny love to raise, Hunted the circling whisper of her praise; Heard envy own her lovely charms, tho' loth, Heard taste attest them with a modish oath; And, nuptial projects thickening in his mind, Now his fair partner in the dance rejoin'd. As now the sprightly music paus'd, my lord Eager resolv'd to touch a softer chord; Secure of all repulse, he vainly meant Half to display, half hide his fond intent, And, in dissembled passion's flowery tropes, To sport at leisure with the virgin's hopes: For this he fram'd a motley speech, replete With amorous compliment and vain conceit. The labour'd nothing with complacent pride He spoke; but to his speech no nymph replied: For in the moment, the lost fair devotes Her willing ear to more attractive notes. The minstrel happen'd near the nymph to walk, Rapt with a bosom-friend in secret talk, And, at the instant when the earl began Half to unfold his matrimonial plan, Edwin, in whispers, from the crowd retir'd, Chanc'd to repeat the sonnet she inspir'd: The sounds, tho' faint, her recollection caught, Drew her quick eye, and fixt her wondering thought. Lost in this sweet surprise, she could not hear A single accent of the amorous peer. Spleen saw the moment that she sought to gain, And perch'd triumphant on the noble's brain. With jealous envy stung, and baffled pride, “Contemptuous girl!” with sudden rage, he cried, “If here to happier youths thy views incline, I want not fairer nymphs who challenge mine. Thy breast in vain with penitence may burn; But, once neglected, I no more return.” Thus loudly speaking, with distemper'd heat, Rudely he turn'd, with rancorous scorn replete. Serena, startled at th' injurious sound, Survey'd th' insulting peer, who sternly frown'd; Shame and resentment thro' her bosom rush, Swell every vein, and raise the burning blush. Love, new-born love, but in its birth conceal'd, Nor to the nymph herself as yet reveal'd, And just disdain, and anger's honest flame, With complicated power convulse her frame: Contending passions every thought confound, And in tumultuous doubt her soul is drown'd. Now treacherous pride, who tempts her tongue to trip, Forms to a keen reply her quivering lip: Insidious Spleen now hovers o'er the fair, Deems her half lock'd within her hateful snare; In her new slave preparing to rejoice, To taint her spirit, and untune her voice. Hapless Serena! what can save thee now? The fiend's dark signet stamps thy clouded brow, In thy swoln eye I see the starting drop; This fatal shower, ætherial guardian! stop: Haste to thy votary, haste, her soul sustain, Nor let the trials she has past be vain. Ah me! while yet I speak, with shuddering dread I hear the magic girdle's bursting thread. This horrid omen, ye kind powers! avert: Nor thou, bright zone! thy brighter charge desert. Ah, fruitless prayer! her panting breast behold! See! the gauze shakes in many a ruffled fold! Forc'd from their station by her heaving heart, From the strain'd girdle thrice three spangles start: Thro' her disorder'd dress a pass they've found, And fallen, see, they glitter on the ground!— O blessed chance! with life-recalling light The glittering monitors attract her sight! Like stars emerging from the darken'd pole, They sparkle safety to her harrass'd soul. See! from her brow the clouds of trouble fly, Vexation's tear is vanish'd from her eye! Her rosy cheeks with joy's soft radiance burn, Like nature smiling at the sun's return; The nymph, no more with mental darkness blind, Shines the sweet ruler of her rescu'd mind. Hence, hateful Spleen! thy fancied prize resign, Renounce for ever what shall ne'er be thine; For, conscious of her airy guardian's aid, She feels new spirit thro' her heart convey'd, And, inly blessing this victorious hour, Her soul exults in its recover'd power. In such mild terms she hails th' insulting peer, As Spleen, if mortal, must expire to hear; But, driven for ever from the lovely girl, The foul fiend riots in the captive earl. He answers not; but, with a sullen air, On happier Edwin, who approach'd the fair, Darts such a glance of rage and envious hate, As Satan cast on Eden's blissful state, When on our parents first he fixt his sight, And undelighted gaz'd on all delight: So doom'd to look, and doom'd such pangs to feel, Scornful he turn'd on his elastic heel. “O lovely mildness! oh angelic maid! Deserving homage, tho' to scorn betray'd; Rise still, sweet spirit, rise these wrongs above, Turn from injurious pride to faithful love; Tho' on my brow no coronet may shine, Wealth I can offer at thy beauty's shrine, And, worthier thee, a heart that worships thine.” Thus, with new-kindled love's aspiring flame, Spoke the fond youth conceal'd by Edwin's name, The gallant Falkland, rich in inborn worth, By fortune blest, and not of abject birth. Warmly he spoke, with that indignant heat With which the generous heart ne'er fails to beat, When worth insulted wakens virtuous ire, And injur'd beauty sets the soul on fire. Quick to his voice the startled virgin turn'd, With wonder, hope, and joy, her bosom burn'd; With sweet confusion, flurried and amaz'd, On his attractive form she wildly gaz'd. Full on her thought the friendly visions rush'd; Blushing she view'd him, view'd him still and blush'd; And, soft affection quickening at the sight, Perchance had swoon'd with fullness of delight, But that her father's voice, with quick controul, Recall'd the functions of her fainting soul. When on the distant seat, where, fondly fixt, He view'd the nymph as in the dance she mixt, He indistinctly heard, with wounded ear, The spleenful outrage of the angry peer, Swift at th' imperfect sound, with choler wild, He sprung to succour his insulted child; But ere his fury into language broke, Love calm'd the storm that arrogance awoke. The sudden burst of Falkland's tender flame, His winning manners, his distinguish'd name, His liberal soul, by fortune's smile carest, All join'd to harmonize the father's breast. His fiery thoughts subside in glad surprise, And to the generous youth he warmly cries: “Ingenuous Falkland! by thy frankness won, My willing heart would own thee as my son; But on thy hopes Serena must decide:— Haste we together from this house of pride.” So spoke the sire; for, to her votary kind, Sophrosyne inspir'd his soften'd mind. Speaking, he smil'd, to see that on his word The lover hung, and blest the sounds he heard; That his embarrass'd child his sentence caught With each tumultuous sign of tender thought; Whose blushes, springing from the heart, declare The dawn of fondness in the modest fair. Th' enchanted youth with ecstasy convey'd Forth from the troubled feast the trembling maid. As the keen sailor, whom his daring soul Has drawn, too vent'rous, near the freezing pole; Who, having slighted caution's tame advice, Seems wedg'd within impervious worlds of ice; If, from each chilling form of peril free, At length he reach the unincumber'd sea, With joy superior to his transient pain, Rushes, exulting, o'er th' expansive main: Such strong delight Serena's bosom shar'd, When sweet reflection to her heart declar'd, That all the trials of her fate were past, And love's decisive plaudit seal'd the last. Her airy guard prepares the softest down, From peace's wing, to line the nuptial crown: Her smiles accelerate the bridal morn, And clear her votary's path from every thorn. On the quick match the prude's keen censures fall, Blind to the heavenly power who guided all: But mild Serena scorn'd the prudish play, To wound warm love with frivolous delay; Nature's chaste child, not affectation's slave, The heart she meant to give, she frankly gave. Thro' her glad sire no gouty humours run, Jocund he glories in his destin'd son. Penelope herself, no longer seen In the sour semblance of tormenting Spleen, Buys for her niece the robes of nuptial state, Nor scolds the mercer once thro' all the long debate. For quick dispatch, the honest man of law Toils half the night the legal ties to draw; At length th' enraptur'd youth, all forms compleat, Bears his sweet bride to his paternal seat; On a fair lawn the chearful mansion stood, And high behind it rose a circling wood. As the blest lord of this extensive reign Led his dear partner thro' her new domain, With fond surprise, Serena soon descried A temple rais'd to her ætherial guide. Its ornaments she view'd with tender awe, Their fashion such as she in vision saw; For the kind youth, her grateful smile to gain, Had, from her clear description, deck'd the fane.

First stood Connubial Love, a manly youth, Whose bright eye spoke the ardent vows of truth; Friendship, sweet smiling, fill'd the second place, In all the softer charms of virgin grace. Their meeting arms a mystic tablet raise, Deck'd with these lines, the moral of my lays:— “Virtue's an ingot of Peruvian gold, Sense the bright ore Potosi's mines unfold; But Temper's image must their use create, And give these precious metals sterling weight.” FINIS.</field>
