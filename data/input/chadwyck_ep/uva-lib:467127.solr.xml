      <field name="fulltext">Dedicated TO MY DEAR LITTLE COUSIN JANET HOLLWAY</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER I. ABOVE THE CLOUDS. [âAnd can this be my own world?] âAnd can this be my own world? 'Tis all gold and snow, Save where scarlet waves are hurled Down yon gulf below.â â'Tis thy world, 'tis my world, City, mead, and shore, For he that hath his own world Hath many worlds more.â</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER III WINDING-UP TIME. [âWake, baillie, wake! the crafts are out] âWake, baillie, wake! the crafts are out; Wake!â said the knight, âbe quick! For high street, bye street, over the town They fight with poker and stick.â Said the squire, âA fight so fell was ne'er In all thy bailliewick.â What said the old clock in the tower? âTick, tick, tick!â âWake, daughter, wake! the hour draws on; Wake!â quoth the dame, âbe quick! The meats are set, the guests are coming, The fiddler waxing his stick.â She said, âThe bridegroom waiting and waiting To see thy face is sick.â What said the new clock in her bower? âTick, tick, tick!â</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV. BEES AND OTHER FELLOW-CREATURES. [The dove laid some little sticks] The dove laid some little sticks, Then began to coo; The gnat took his trumpet up To play the day through; The pie chattered soft and longâ But that she always does; The bee did all he had to do, And only said âBuzz.â</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER V. THE PARROT IN HIS SHAWL. That handkerchief Did an Egyptian to my mother give: She was a charmer, and could almost read The thoughts of people. âOthello. [My good manâhe's an old, old manâ] My good manâhe's an old, old manâ And my good man got a fall, To buy me a bargain so fast he ran When he heard the gipsies call: âBuy, buy brushes, Baskets wrought o' rushes. Buy them, buy them, take them, try them, Buy, dames all.â My old man, he has money and land, And a young, young wife am I. Let him put the penny in my white hand When he hears the gipsies cry: âBuy, buy laces, Veils to screen your faces. Buy them, buy them, take and try them. Buy, maids, buy.â [My fair lady's a dear, dear ladyâ] My fair lady's a dear, dear ladyâ I walked by her side to woo. In a garden alley, so sweet and shady, She answered, âI love not you, John, John Brady,â Quoth my dear lady, âPray now, pray now, go your way now, Do, John, do!â [Yet my fair lady's my own, own lady] Yet my fair lady's my own, own lady, For I passed another day; While making her moan, she sat all alone, And thus and thus did she say: âJohn, John Brady,â Quoth my dear lady, âDo now, do now, once more woo now, Pray, John, pray!â</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VI. THE TOWN WITH NOBODY IN IT. [âMaster,â quoth the auld hound] âMaster,â quoth the auld hound, âWhere will ye go?â âOver moss, over muir, To court my new jo.â âMaster, though the night be merk, I'se follow through the snow. âCourt her, master, court her, So shall ye do weel; But and ben she'll guide the house, I'se get milk and meal. Ye'se get lilting while she sits With her rock and reel.â âFor, oh! she has a sweet tongue, And een that look down, A gold girdle for her waist, And a purple gown. She has a good word forbye Fra a' folk in the town.â</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIII. A STORY. [In the night she told a story] In the night she told a story, In the night and all night through, While the moon was in her glory, And the branches dropped with dew. 'Twas my life she told, and round it Rose the years as from a deep; In the world's great heart she found it, Cradled like a child asleep. In the night I saw her weaving By the misty moonbeam cold, All the weft her shuttle cleaving With a sacred thread of gold. Ah! she wept me tears of sorrow, Lulling tears so mystic sweet; Then she wove my last to-morrow, And her web lay at my feet. Of my life she made the story: I must weepâso soon 'twas told! But your name did lend it glory, And your love its thread of gold! [Drop, drop from the leaves of lign aloes] Drop, drop from the leaves of lign aloes, O honey-dew! drop from the tree. Float up through your clear river shallows, White lilies, beloved of the bee. Let the people, O Queen! say, and bless thee, Her bounty drops soft as the dew, And spotless in honour confess thee, As lilies are spotless in hue. On the roof stands yon white stork awaking, His feathers flush rosy the while, For, lo! from the blushing east breaking, The sun sheds the bloom of his smile. Let them boast of thy word, âIt is certain; We doubt it no more,â let them say, âThan to-morrow that night's dusky curtain Shall roll back its folds for the day.â</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IX. AFTER THE PARTY. Stephano. This will prove a brave kingdom to me, Where I shall have my music for nothing. The Tempest. [When I sit on market-days amid the comers and the goers] When I sit on market-days amid the comers and the goers, Oh! full oft I have a vision of the days without alloy, And a ship comes up the river with a jolly gang of towers, And a âpull'e haul'e, pull'e haul'e, yoy! heave, hoy!â There is busy talk around me, all about mine ears it hummeth, But the wooden wharves I look on, and a dancing, heaving buoy, For 'tis tidetime in the river, and she comethâoh, she cometh! With a âpull'e haul'e, pull'e haul'e, yoy! heave, hoy!â Then I hear the water washing, never golden waves were brighter, And I hear the capstan creakingâ'tis a sound that cannot cloy. Bring her to, to ship her lading, brig or schooner, sloop or lighter, With a âpull'e haul'e, pull'e haul'e, yoy! heave, hoy!â âWill ye step aboard, my dearest? for the high seas lie before us.â So I sailed adown the river in those days without alloy. We are launched! But when, I wonder, shall a sweeter sound float o'er us Than yon âpull'e haul'e, pull'e haul'e, yoy! heave, hoy!â</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER X. MOPSA LEARNS HER LETTERS. Aâapple-pie. Bâbit it. [The marten flew to the finch's nest] The marten flew to the finch's nest, Feathers, and moss, and a wisp of hay: âThe arrow it sped to thy brown mate's breast; Low in the broom is thy mate to-day.â âLiest thou low, love? low in the broom? Feathers and moss, and a wisp of hay, Warm the white eggs till I learn his doom.â She beateth her wings, and away, away. âAh, my sweet singer, thy days are told (Feathers and moss, and a wisp of hay)! Thine eyes are dim, and the eggs grow cold. O mournful morrow! O dark to-day!â The finch flew back to her cold, cold nest, Feathers and moss, and a wisp of hay. Mine is the trouble that rent her breast, And home is silent, and love is clay.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XI. GOOD MORNING, SISTER. [Sweet is childhoodâchildhood's over] Sweet is childhoodâchildhood's over, Kiss and part. Sweet is youth; but youth's a roverâ So's my heart. Sweet is rest; but by all showing Toil is nigh. We must go. Alas! the going, Say âgood-bye.â [On the rocks by Aberdeen] On the rocks by Aberdeen, Where the whislin' wave had been, As I wandered and at e'en Was eerie; There I saw thee sailing west, And I ran with joy opprestâ Ay, and took out all my best, My dearie. Then I busked mysel' wi' speed, And the neighbours cried âWhat need? 'Tis a lass in any weed Aye bonny!â Now my heart, my heart is sair. What's the good, though I be fair, For thou'lt never see me mair, Man Johnnie! LIKE A LAVEROCK IN THE LIFT. I It's we two, it's we two, it's we two for aye, All the world and we two, and Heaven be our stay. Like a laverock in the lift, sing, O bonny bride! All the world was Adam once, with Eve by his side. II What's the world, my lass, my love!âwhat can it do? I am thine, and thou art mine; life is sweet and new. If the world have missed the mark, let it stand by, For we two have gotten leave, and once more we'll try. III Like a laverock in the lift, sing, O bonny bride! It's we two, it's we two, happy side by side. Take a kiss from me thy man; now the song begins: âAll is made afresh for us, and the brave heart wins.â IV When the darker days come, and no sun will shine, Thou shalt dry my tears, lass, and I'll dry thine. It's we two, it's we two, while the world's away, Sitting by the golden sheaves on our wedding-day.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XII. THEY RUN AWAY FROM OLD MOTHER FATE. [A land that living warmth disowns] A land that living warmth disowns, It meets my wondering ken; A land where all the men are stones, Or all the stones are men.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIII. MELON SEEDS. Rosalind. Well, this is the forest of Arden.Touchstone. Ay, now am I in Arden: the more fool I; when I was at home I was in a better place; but travellers must be content. As you Like it. [Little babe, while burns the west] Little babe, while burns the west, Warm thee, warm thee in my breast; While the moon doth shine her best, And the dews distil not. All the land so sad, so fairâ Sweet its toils are, blest its care. Child, we may not enter there! Some there are that will not. Fain would I thy margins know, Land of work, and land of snow; Land of life, whose rivers flow On, and on, and stay not. Fain would I thy small limbs fold, While the weary hours are told, Little babe in cradle cold. Some there are that may not.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIV. REEDS AND RUSHES. 'Tis merry, 'tis merry in Fairyland, When Fairy birds are singing; When the court doth ride by their monarch's side, With bit and bridle ringing. Walter Scott. [Turn your back on the light, and you'll follow a shadow.] Turn your back on the light, and you'll follow a shadow. The deaf queen Fate has dumb courtiers. If the hound is your foe, don't sleep in his kennel. That that is, is.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XV. THE QUEEN'S WAND. One, two, three, four; one, two, three, four; 'Tis still one, two, three, four. Mellow and silvery are the tones, But I wish the bells were more. Southey. [The prince shall to the chase again] The prince shall to the chase again, The dame has got her face again, The king shall have his place again Aneath the fairy dome. And all the knights shall woo again, And all the doves shall coo again, And all the dreams come true again, And Jack shall go home. [Though the sun shine brightly] Though the sun shine brightly, Wand, wand, guide rightly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVI. FAILURE. [We are much bound to them that do succeed] We are much bound to them that do succeed; But, in a more pathetic sense, are bound To such as fail. They all our loss expound; They comfort us for work that will not speed, And lifeâitself a failure. Ay, his deed, Sweetest in story, who the dusk profound Of Hades flooded with entrancing sound, Music's own tears, was failure. Doth it read Therefore the worse? Ah, no! So much to dare, He fronts the regnant Darkness on its throne.â So much to do; impetuous even there, He pours out love's disconsolate sweet moanâ He wins; but few for that his deed recall: Its power is in the look which costs him all. [âHe had brought them,â he said, âsome meat on a bone] âHe had brought them,â he said, âsome meat on a bone: They were welcome to pick it or leave it alone.â [One morning, oh! so early, my belovÃ¨d, my belovÃ¨d] One morning, oh! so early, my belovÃ¨d, my belovÃ¨d, All the birds were singing blithely, as if never they would cease; 'Twas a thrush sang in my garden, âHear the story, hear the story!â And the lark sang, âGive us glory!â And the dove said, âGive us peace!â Then I listened, oh! so early, my belovÃ¨d, my belovÃ¨d, To that murmur from the woodland of the dove, my dear, the dove; When the nightingale came after, âGive us fame to sweeten duty!â When the wren sang, âGive us beauty!â She made answer, âGive us love!â Sweet is spring, and sweet the morning, my belovÃ¨d, my belovÃ¨d; Now for us doth spring, doth morning, wait upon the year's increase, And my prayer goes up, âOh, give us, crowned in youth with marriage glory, Give for all our life's dear story, Give us love, and give us peace!â [Who pipes upon the long green hill] I. Who pipes upon the long green hill, Where meadow grass is deep? The white lamb bleats but followeth onâ Follow the clean white sheep. The dear white lady in yon high tower, She hearkeneth in her sleep. All in long grass the piper stands, Goodly and grave is he; Outside the tower, at dawn of day, The notes of his pipe ring free. A thought from his heart doth reach to hers: âCome down, O lady! to me.â She lifts her head, she dons her gown: Ah! the lady is fair; She ties the girdle on her waist, And binds her flaxen hair, And down she stealeth, down and down, Down the turret stair. Behold him! With the flock he wons Along yon grassy lea. âMy shepherd lord, my shepherd love, What wilt thou, then, with me? My heart is gone out of my breast, And followeth on to thee.â II. âThe white lambs feed in tender grass: With them and thee to bide, How good it were,â she saith at noon; âAlbeit the meads are wide. Oh! well is me,â she saith when day Draws on to eventide. Hark! hark! the shepherd's voice. Oh, sweet! Her tears drop down like rain. âTake now this crook, my chosen, my fere, And tend the flock full fain: Feed them, O lady, and lose not one, Till I shall come again.â Right soft her speech: âMy will is thine, And my reward thy grace!â Gone are his footsteps over the hill, Withdrawn his goodly face; The mournful dusk begins to gather, The daylight wanes apace. III. On sunny slopes, ah! long the lady Feedeth her flock at noon; She leads them down to drink at eve Where the small rivulets croon. All night her locks are wet with dew, Her eyes outwatch the moon. Over the hills her voice is heard, She sings when light doth wane: âMy longing heart is full of love. When shall my loss be gain? My shepherd lord, I see him not, But he will come again.â</field>
