      <field name="fulltext">POETICAL PIECES. Written by Mr. BOOTH. SONG. [In vain unhappy Damon tries] I In vain unhappy Damon tries, To find Repose in Liberty; Pleasure, the dull Condition, flies, A Lover he must live and die. His amorous Heart no more can bear The tedious Night, and irksome Day; He pines for some good-natur'd Fair, To pass the heavy Hours away. II Be kind, ye Pow'rs! and hear his Prayer; Propitious to his Wishes prove; Direct him to the destin'd Fair, Who best deserves his Truth in Love: Fain wou'd he taste her friendly Charms, And longs the healing Balm to try; Fain wou'd he languish in her Arms, Wou'd with her live, and with her die. SONG. [Am I then condemn'd by Love] I Am I then condemn'd by Love, Still to wander, still to rove; Ever searching, never finding, Hearing, swearing Oaths not binding; Still pursuing, still astray, Hunting Truth that flies away. II Yet I the Chase can never leave, But still my own fond Hopes deceive: 'Till Mira! soft, inviting Fair! By Nature form'd to bless my Arms, Shall stop me in my full Career, A Victim to her friendly Charms; Observe her Blushes, and her Sighs, Mark not her Words, but watch her Eyes! III Truth is in her tender Breast; Her Looks are sweet, and full of Love; My Soul in her alone wou'd rest, Nor any further Trial prove: But if my Wish I fail to gain, No Disappointment I'll deplore; But swear, and lye, and still remain The wand'ring Thing I was before. SONG. [Can then a Look create a Thought] I Can then a Look create a Thought, Which Time can ne'er remove? Yes, foolish Heart, again thou'rt caught, Again thou bleed'st for Love. II She sees the Conquest of her Eyes, Nor heals the Wounds she gave; She smiles, whene'er his Blushes rise, And shuns her sighing Slave. III Yet Swain, be bold, and still adore her, Still her flying Charms pursue; Love and Friendship both implore her, Pleading, Night and Day, for you. SONG. [What need of Words, or Oaths, to prove] I What need of Words, or Oaths, to prove, The Truth of my unbounded Love: Or that the Flame which warms my Breast, Long as my Breath of Life will last. II When Phœbus in the Spring appears, Nature a verdant Livery wears; The whole Creation blith and gay, Revives to feel the warmer Day. III Nearer the Zenith now he moves; Nature her various Charms improves, And all her Beauties now displays, Pierc'd by her Lover's kindly Rays. IV But lo! the Wanderer retires! Nature laments her sick'ning Fires: Her various Beauties all decay, And, in his Absence, die away. V Thou, Fairest! Phœbus art to me, As Nature Him, I worship Thee! The quickning Fires thy Eyes impart, Shoot thro' my Veins, and warm my Heart. VI But Oh! take heed, and still improve, With constant Rays, the Plant of Love: The tender Root decays, and dies, Robb'd of the Warmth that made it rise. VII Then ask nor Words, nor Oaths, to prove The Truth of my unbounded Love: Since You alone, my only Joy, Your own Creation can destroy. DAMON to PHILOMEL. I Midnight Charmer of the Grove, Where I lament my wretched Fate: Our joint Complaint, alas! is Love, The Difference of our Fortune, great. II Relief to me no Seasons bring; For ever doom'd to sigh in vain: But you, sweet Bird, who mourn in Spring, In Summer Pleasures lose your Pain. III Already from yon bloomy Spray, Your willing Mate your Plaint returns; Already seems to chide your Stay, And with an equal Ardour burns. IV Go, Philomel, accomplish all The Joy, that happy Love bestows: Obey the tender Warbler's Call, And leave poor Damon to his Woes. V And when the new, returning Year, Again shall call you to the Grove; Sweet Philomel, you'll find me here, Complaining still of hopeless Love. SONG. [Sweet are the Charms of her I love] Sweet are the Charms of her I love, More fragrant than the Damask Rose; Soft as the Down on Turtle-Dove; Gentle as Air when Zephir blows; Refreshing as descending Rains, To Sun-burnt Climes and thirsty Plains. True as the Needle to the Pole, Or as the Dial to the Sun; Constant as gliding Waters roll, Whose swelling Tides obey the Moon: From ev'ry other Charmer free, My Life and Love shall follow thee. The Lamb the flow'ry Thyme devours; The Dam the tender Kid pursues; Sweet Philomel, in shady Bowers Of verdant Spring, his Note renews: All follow what they most admire, As I pursue my Soul's Desire. Nature must change her beauteous Face, And vary as the Seasons rise; As Winter to the Spring gives place, Summer th' Approach of Autumn flies: No Change in Love the Seasons bring, Love only knows perpetual Spring. Devouring Time, with stealing Pace, Makes lofty Oaks and Cedars bow; And marble Tow'rs, and Walls of Brass, In his rude March he levels low: But Time, destroying far and wide, Love from the Soul can ne'er divide. Death only, with his cruel Dart, The gentle Godhead can remove; And drive him from the bleeding Heart, To mingle with the Bless'd above: Where, known to all his kindred Train, He finds a lasting Rest from Pain. Love, and his Sister fair, the Soul, Twin-born, from Heav'n together came; Love will the Universe controul, When dying Seasons lose their Name: Divine Abodes shall own his Pow'r, When Time and Death shall be no more. SONG. [Wanton Chloe, young and charming] I Wanton Chloe, young and charming, Kindles but a short-liv'd Fire: Fickle Humours Love disarming, Quench the Flame her Eyes inspire. II So a gliding Vapour shining, Bright as Stars that deck the Skies, Quickly from its Height declining, Glitters in its Fall, and dies. III Mira ev'ry Grace adorning, Gently warms my fond Desire; Sigh for ev'ry Sigh returning, Like a Vestal, feeds the Fire. IV Hiding still the sacred Pleasure From the prying vulgar Eye; Still resigning all her Treasure, Giving, without Pain, the Joy. Written Extempore on a blank Leaf in Rymer's Remarks upon Shakespeare. Rymer, in quest of Helicon, To Pudde-Dock the Muses brings; He drinks the muddy Water down, And swears 'tis Aganippe's Spring. To Addle-Hill then takes his Way, Which seems to him Parnassus fair; And there invokes the God of Day, Who, propitious, grants his Pray'r. “Poet be thou, and Critick too, (Apollo laughing said) “A double Infamy's thy Due, “And Midas' Ears shall grace thy Head. Edgar Edgar, a miserable Play wrote by Rymer, as an Example of true Tragedy. thou art doom'd to write: Shakespeare divine shalt dare to blame; Thy Works shall wait on Bums that sh?, Of Laureat Dunces, first in Fame. SONG. [As in the Myrtle Bow'r I lay] Translated from the French. As in the Myrtle Bow'r I lay, A mournful Echo fill'd the Grove; 'Twas Silvia's Voice imploring Love: “Oh cease to wound me, cruel Boy! “Be kind, and send a faithful Swain, “Whose Balm apply'd, may heal my Pain. II Straight I approach'd my Soul's Desire; And thus, with tender Looks, I said: “Love ever hears the sighing Maid, “And kindly sends the faithful Swain, “In whom a longing Maid may find “The Balm to heal a love-sick Mind. III Trembling, she push'd me from her Side; Which still the more increas'd her Pain; Finding, at length, she strove in vain, “O Love! she cry'd, I feel thy Pow'r, “Who can the raging Smart endure? So took the Balm, and found the Cure. ODE. On MIRA, DANCING. She comes! the God of Love asserts his Reign, Resistless o'er the gazing Throng: Alone she fills the spacious Scene! The Charm of ev'ry Eye! the Praise of ev'ry Tongue! Order and Grace together join'd, Sweetness with Majesty combin'd, To make the beauteous Form compleat, On ev'ry Step and Motion wait. Now to a slow and melting Air she moves; Her Eyes their Softness steal from Venus' Doves: So like in Shape, in Air, and Mien, She passes for the Paphian Queen; The Graces all around her play; The wond'ring Gazers die away. Whether her easy Body bend, Or her fair Bosom heave with Sighs; Whether her graceful Arms extend, Or gently fall, or slowly rise; Or returning, or advancing; Swimming round, or sidelong glancing; Gods! how divine an Air Harmonious Gesture gives the Fair! We see, in all her Pride, The well-trimm'd Bark at Anchor ride; But when her hoisted Sails she spreads, And o'er the bounding Waves her wat'ry Dance she leads, With new Delight the Object we survey, While in the Winds her wanton Streamers play. Strange Force of Motion! that subdues the Soul, Like sweetest Music's magic Pow'r! That can the noisy Multitude controul! Can Eloquence her self do more? But now the flying Fingers strike the Lyre! The sprightly Notes the Nymph inspire; She whirls around! she bounds! she springs! As if Jove's Messenger had lent her Wings. Such Daphne was, when near old Peneus' Stream She fled, to shun a loath'd Embrace; (Of antient Bards the frequent Theme) Such were her lovely Limbs, so flush'd her charming Face! So round her Neck! her Eyes so fair! So rose her swelling Chest! so flow'd her Amber Hair! While her swift Feet outstript the Wind, And left th' enamour'd God of Day behind. While the light-footed Fairy flies, Our mounting Spirits nimbly rise; The Pulse still answer to the Strains, And the Blood dances in our Veins. Of Cynthia's Air let Poets dream, When from the hoary Mountains Height, Down to Eurotas' silent Stream, She leads her Virgin Train, and charms the Sight: Whether on Mountains, or in Woods, In flow'ry Launs, or verdant Fields, Or bathing in the silver Floods, Lo! to a mortal Fair the fansy'd Goddess yields. The xxxivth ODE of the First Book of Horace, Imitated. By wild Philosophy misled, Regardless of the Gods, too long I stray'd. Urg'd by Impulse Divine, at length I mourn My Crimes, and to Religion's sacred Rites return. Mark the blue Light'ning from Jove's fiery Carr! Sedate he drives his thund'ring Steeds from far! Swift through the bursting Clouds and flaming Air! Earth, our dull Mother, groans; the River-Gods, Confounded, tremble in their deep Abodes! From their broad Base upheav'd, the lofty Mountains bow; Ev'n Hell's Foundations feel the dreadful Blow. Headlong amidst the base-born Croud, He flings the Haughty, and the Proud; Now lifts the Lowly high in Air! Now sinks the Mighty in Despair! Sudden, he seizes on the Tyrant's Crown, And bids another fill the vacant Throne! An Imitation of the First Ode of Horace, Book III. Great Liberties are taken with the Original: sometimes he is closely follow'd, and as often intirely forsaken. If the Reader please to look upon this Attempt as an Amusement only, 'tis all can be desir'd. My Obligations to a Friend, who deserves infinitely more than I have said of her, interrupted my first Design, and led me into the Digression which occasion'd the Conclusion. B. Booth. I hate the common Herd. Hence ye profane! A silent uncorrupted Train, Virgins, and blooming Youths, attend my Lyre: Lo! great Apollo's sacred Choir, With Strains unheard before, their Priest inspire. Empires mighty Monarchs Sway; Those mighty Monarchs Jove obey: He bends the Heavens with his Imperial Nod, Prostrate the Giants fell, and own'd the Conqu'ror God. Some of the first Post of Honour claim, Proud of their Birth and ancient Name; Rivall'd by Those, whose wide-spread Furrows bear The various Harvest of the Year: Vain is their Contest, vain their Boast, In Death is all Distinction lost: While o'er the impious Courtier's Head, Threat'ning aloft, the Dagger hung; In vain the costly Feast was spread, In vain the charming Minstrel sung: Sleep weighs his Eyelids down no more, Nor Philomel's sweet Strains his murder'd Peace restore. Lolling at Ease in humble Cells, Gentle Morpheus ever dwells: Or by the hoary Forest's Side, Or where the murm'ring Waters glide. Seek what Nature can suffice; And fearless view the troubled Shore, When the black Tempest veils the Skies, And the tumultuous Surges roar. Whither, at length, will Human Pride aspire! The Great their Fathers' Palaces disdain, Encumb'ring with vast Tow'rs the Main: From the contracted Latian Shore, Old Ocean's various Broods retire, And distant, and more spacious Seas explore. Go climb thy lofty Argos' Side; Or trust thy Courser's swift Career; Or in thy marble Tow'rs confide; Vain is thy Flight, alas! from Care, There's no Retreat, proud Man, from Guilt and Fear. Here begins the Digression from Horace, mention'd in the Author's Preface to this Ode.Since then, fair Peace and Innocence, Disdaining Pomp, and Pow'r, and Pride, United shed their sweetest Influence, Where artless Maids, and lab'ring Hinds reside, Grant my Desire! A homely Seat, Far from the Guilty, and the Great; A limpid Stream—an antient Grove; And Health and Joy to her I love; Grant my Desire, propitious Jove! Happy the Hour when first our Souls were join'd! The social Virtues, and the chearful Mind Have ever crown'd our Days, beguil'd our Pain; Strangers to Discord, and her clam'rous Train. Connubial Friendship, Hail! but haste away, The Lark and Nightingale reproach thy Stay; From splendid Theatres to rural Scenes, Joyous retire!—so bounteous Heaven ordains. There we may dwell in Peace— There bless the rising Morn, and flow'ry Field, Charm'd with the guiltless Sports the Flumina amem Sylvasque inglorius! Virg.Woods and Waters yield. FINIS.</field>
