      <field name="fulltext">TO THE RIGHT honorable and my very good Lord, sir Thomas Sackuile knight, lord Buckhurst: Thomas Vnderdowne wisheth conti?ual health, with encrese of Honor. Ouid his inuectiue against IBIS. Whole fifty yeares be gone and past since I alyue haue beene: Yet of my Muse ere now there hath no armed verse be seene. Among so many thousande workes, yet extant to be had: No bloudy letter can be red that euer Naso made. Nor yet no man (set me aside) my bookes haue causde to smart: Syth I my selfe am cast away, by my inuented arte. On man there is that wil not let, (this is a grieuous paine) The title of my curteous verse, for euer to remaine. VVhat so he be, as yet his name, shal not by me be wrayde: VVho me constraines to take in hand, no weapons erst assayde. Hee wil not let me, sent almost vnto the frosen Zone: In banishment take restlesse ease, and there to lye vnknowne. That cruel man doth vexe my wounds, that seke for needeful rest: And slanderous wordes doth vtter oft where great resort is prest. He suffreth not my coupled mate. by lasting league of bed, To wayle hir wretched husbands corse, not much vnlike the dead. And while some part of beaten barke, I hard do holde in hande, He striues to haue the onely bowrde, wheron I swim to lande. And he who should of right put out eche sodaine kyndled flame: Too violent, doth seeke to gette his pray amid the same. He labors that my wandring age, due norishment should lacke: Oh how much worthyer to beare, our mischiues on his backe? The Gods do graunt me better lucke, of whom he is greatst to mee: That wil not see my trauel want, opprest with penury. To him therfore deserued thankes, as long as I shal liue: For his so kinde and curteise heart, I euermore wil giue. Let Pontus hereof record beare, and he perhaps wil make. That I shal of some nearer coast, hereof a witnesse take. But vnto thee thou cruel man, that treadest on me so, VVherein I may (alas therfore) I will be stil thy foe. Yea moysture shal surcease to bee, contrary to the dry: And with the Moone bright Phœbus beams, shal ioynedbe on hye: And one part of the heauens shal sende East and VVest windes forth: And eke the moysting Southern winde shal blow out of the North: And new agreement shal be made. in brothers smoke againe: VVhich earst in blasing flames of fyre, olde rancor rent in twayne. The spring with Autumne shalbe one, with VVinter Sommers guise: And in one Country shal the Sun at once both set and rise: Ere I wil concord haue with thee, sith thou didst breake the bande: And set these weapons cleane aside, that I haue tane in hand. Than that my griefe by any space, may euer ended bee: Or time and houre may asswage, my hatred toward thee. This peace shal be betwixt vs stil, as long as lyfe shal last: My fyrst battayles I mynde to wage, in style as I begone: Although like wars in style not lyke, are wonted to be done. And as the pleased soldires speare, that dothe fearce Veles hight: Doth fyrst styck fast in sandy grounde, as cunning taught him ryght. So I with sharp and poynted dart, yet wyl not shoute at thee: Ne shal my speare forth with confound, the hated head of mee. And in this booke ne name nor deede, of thee I mynde to sayne: And what thou art a lyttle while, I geue thee leaue to fayne. But if as now, hereafter thou do styll, Iambus good And fytte for me, shall weapons geue, sprent with Lycambus blood. But now as earst Calimacbus, dyd enmy Ibis cursse: By that same meanes both thee &amp; thine I earnestly do cursse. And as he dyd, so I my verse, wyll wrap in stories blynde: Although my selfe am neuer wont to imitate this kynde. His trade obscure I folowing, gainste Ibys wyll inuay, My customes olde and iudgement to, the whyle wyll cast away. And for bicause yet what thou arte, (to them that aske the same) I tell it not, thou also shalt tyll then haue Ibys name. And as my verses shalbe stufte, with some obscurytie: So let the course of all thy life, be fyllde with myserie. Of him that luckyest is to gesse, the same be done to thee: One day wherein thou tokest lyfe, and fyrst of Ianuarye. The gods that rule both sea and land, and better kyngedomes guyde: In equall power with Iupiter, betwene the Poles so wyde: Oh hitherto I pray you all, be prestt, apply your minde: And graunt that these my hearty hestes, desired waight may fynde. And thou thy self (oh Tellus fayre) thou Sea with all thy waues: And Ayer highest of the rest, graunt what my prayers craues. And eke you Starres and Phebus to, with beames compassed bright: Thou Moone also who neuer dost, as ere shew forth thy light. Thou Night who by thy darknes art, of many honoured: And eke you Dames who with three hands, doe spinne the certain thred. Thou Riuer too, that thorow Hell with fearefull noyse dost run: By whom who so doth make a vowe, the same must needes be done. Also ye Furies three, that sitte before the gates of Hell: VVhose riueled hairs are fearfull snakes as auncient Poets tell. Ye basest Gods, Fauni, Satyres, and those that Lares hight: Ye Flouds &amp; Nimphes, and half Gods to, not yet of perfect might. And last ye Gods both olde and newe, that since great Chaos were: Vnto our time, al you I pray, my humble prayers heare. That whylst I an vnfaithful man, by verse doe cause to smart: And raging anger takes in hande, with griefe to play his parte: Let euery one of you by course, geue graunt to my request: And let no parte of prayers mine, without effecte take rest. Let all that I haue prayd be done, and that Neptune may gesse, These not my wordes, but his, who was sonne to Pasaphaes, And all the paynes that I do beare, let them to him betide: And that he may more wretchednes, than erst I did abide. And that my verses which do banne, his counterfeyted name: Do no lesse harme, or lesse may moue, the Gods about the same. I him do curse, who knoweth well, what meneth Ibis name: VVhose conscience knoweth wel, that he deserued hath the same. VVithout delay I redy prest, my causes wyl pursue: VVho o art at my sacrifice, doe it with silence vew. VVho so art at this sacrifice, doe dolefully lament: And goe to Ibis, al thy cheekes, with moisty teares besprent. VVith all yl lucke that may befal, with lefte feete meete him sone: Let vestures blacke your bodyes hide, as is of mourners done. And thou why dost thou doubte to take thy deathlike bandes of force? Now standes the Altar (as thou seest) prepared for thy corse. Let no delayes my banning stay, pompe is prepard for thee: A cursed sacrifice thy throte, vnto my kniues apply. Let thearth deny thee fruit, and stream his waters holde from thee: Let euery winde deny fitte blastes, for thy commoditie. Let not the Sun shine bright on thee, nor glistering Moone by night: And of thy eyes let glimsing starres, forsake the wished sight. Let not the fire graunt thee his heate, nor Ayre humiditie: Let neither earth nor yet the Sea, free passage graunt to thee. That banyshed and poore thou mayst, straunge houses seeke in vayne: That crauing to, with trembling voyce small almes mayst obtayne. That neither sound of body, nor thy mynde in perfect plight: This night be worse than passed day, and next day than this night. That thou mayst still be pitiful, but pitied of none: And that no man nor woman may, for thy mischaunces mone. And that thy teares may hatred moue, thou iudged worthy to, On whom (though many mischefes light) yet worthy many mo. And (that that seldome commes to passe.) I wishe thy whole estate: All wonted fauour for to want, and be replete with hate. And that thou want no cause of death, but mayst be voyde of powre: And that thy lyfe be forste to flye, of death the wished houre. And that thy soule with troubles tost, constrayned styl to stay: May leaue thy wery limmes at length, tormented with delay. It shalbe so, and Phæbus to, that this inforce should stande: Did geue a signe, a dolefull byrde, did fly on my left hande. And sure I thinke that what I wish, the Gods on high shal moue: I will (oh wretch) be fedde with Hope, till death thee hence remoue Hereof shal that day make an ende, that shal thee take from me: Hereof shal that day make an ende, that commes to late to me. But first this soule so many times, sore spyted at of thee, That day shall cary quite away, that comes to late too me, Than this griefe may by any space, of time be wipte away, Or that either day or howre shall, my rooted hate alay. VVhile Thracian's shal with arrowes war, laziges with bowe: VVhile Ganges shalbe luke warme felt, and Ister colde as snowe. VVhile mountaines hye great trees shal beare, infields while grasse shal grow: VVhile Tibris shal through Tuscan land with any water flowe. I wil make warres with thee, not death shall bryng my wrath to ende: But wyll giue weapons to my ghostes, against thy sprytes to sende: And then also when into ayre, my selfe shall turned be: My lyuelesse shadow shall with hate, pursue the ghoste of thee. Then also myndefull of thy deedes, I wyll thy shadowes chace: And I a bony forme wyl be, with thee in euery place. VVhether I by yeares consumed long, (which I would not) shall dye: Or else shal be by force of hand, resolued by and by: Or whether tost amyd the Seas, shall suffer wrack with greefe, And Fyshes strange vpon my corse, shall seeke to fynde releefe. Or whether that the Rauens shall, make of my fleshe theire foode: Or greedy VVolues shal haue their lyps embrewed with my blood. Or whether some may wel vouchsafe, me vnder ground to laye: Or cast me into flaming Fyre, when lyfe is gone away. VVhat so I bee, I mynde to come from Hell, that vgly place: And then with colde (reuenging) hands, wyll scratch thee by the face. Thou waking shalt me see, with gostes, my selfe Ile secret keepe: Then wyll I seeme tappeare too thee, to wake thee from thy sleepe. And last, what so thou dost, before thy face and eyes, Ile flee: And wyll complaine, so that no where, in quiet thou shalt bee. The cruell strokes wherewith I wyll thee smyte, shal sound againe: And hellish brandes before thee styll, shall smoke, vnto thy payne. Alyue thy furyes shall thee vexe, and after Death also: So that the lyfe shall shorter be, than either payne or wo. To thee shal neither Death rytes hap, nor frendly teares befall: Thy body shalbe cast abroade, bewayled nought at al. Thou shalt with cruel hangmans hand be drawne, to all mens ioye: The hooke hard fastned to thy bones, vnto thy more annove. Also the fire that al consumes, from thee alone shal flye: The iust earth shal not graunt thy corps, a place wherein to lie. The Rauens shal with crooked beak, and talands draw apart Thy intreiles, and the greedy dogs, deuoure thy faithlesse heart. And though this praise do make thee proude, that VVolues insatiate, Aboute thy carion corps shall haue, continuall debate. In places too, thou shalt be cast. far from the fieldes of ioy: There shalt thou be, where thurtful sort abydeth in annoy. That Sisipbus doth rowle the stone, and Phlegias is there, Fast tyde vnto a turning VVheele, that doth his members teare. There Belides on shoulders beare, styl waters gushing oute: VVho banisht Ægiptus daughter, were a passing bloody route. There Pelops father, Tantalus, doth Apples want harde by: And stil amidde the watery floud, for thirst is like to die. And he whose head is from his feete, nine acres bredth away: VVho giues his bowels stil vnto the Vulture for hir pray. Here shal one of the Furies cut with cruel whips thy sides: And shal constrayne thee to confesse, the summe of thy misdedes. The seconde shal thy torne limmes commit to serpents ire: The third thy face bemoyst with teares shall cast into the fire. Thy sinfull ghost a thousand wayes, shall there be put to payne: And Æacus to punish thee, shal search his skilful brayne. The pinching paynes of auncient men, he shal transferre to thee: To those that long haue livd in payne, thou cause of ease shalt be. Thou Sisiphe hast one, to whom thy stone commit thou mayst, New members shal turne rounde on wheles that run about so fast. In vayne at fruit and water to this man shal seeke reliefe: This man shal feede the greedy birdes, with euerlasting griefe. No other death shal ende the paynes, that this death bringes to thee: Vnto the griefes that thou shalt haue, no hower last shal be. Of them Ile tell a few, as if the leaues of Ida wood, A man would seeke to count, or tell the drops of Afrike flood. I cannot tell how many flowers, on Hybla hill there be: Nor yet what store of Saffron growes, in land of Cicily. Nor when the VVinter waxeth cold, wyth boysterous Northerne blast: VVhat store of Hayle on Athos falles, tyl it be white at last. Nor by my voyce all the mishaps, most like to fall on thee: Can counted be, though thou wouldst giue a thousand tongues to me. So many and so great mishaps, shal (wretch) to thee be sent: As I my selfe I thinke may be, constrayned to lament. Those teares shold make me euermore, a happy man to be: That weeping should more pleasant be, than laughter vnto me. Thou wert vnhappy at thy birth, (the Gods would haue it so:) No starre did seeme to fauour thee, that might abate thy wo. Then Venus did not shine on thee, nor loue so ful of grace: And neither Moone, nor Sunne for thee, had fauorable place. Nor he whom Maia bright brought forth to Iupiter the great For thee in Skyes his starre did place, in any prosprous seate. The cruel starres of frowning Mars, haue all the rule of thee: And Saturne olde that nothing haue, to promise luckely. Thy birth day to, that thou mightst see nothing but heauinesse: VVas very blacke for to beholde, couerd with cloudinesse. This day is in the Kalendar, that men do Allia cal: In which also was Ibis borne, a common yll to all. VVhom as sone as his mother vile, out of hir wombe had cast. Himselfe found in Ciniphia, with stinking body plast. The Owle that flyeth but by night, against him right toke place: And vttered with hir fatal mouth, vnlucky cryes apace. Him forthwith washt Theumenides, with water ful of mudde: VVheras it came right blacke, from out the foordes of Styx his floude. Those hellish Furies did anoynt, his heart with bitter gall: VVhich done, their hands embrud wyth blood three times they clapped all. These done, they powred bitches milke, into his childish throte. This was the meat that first of all, in Infancie he got. VVherof, he whelpe of such a dame doth al his fiercenes gayne: And barketh forth in euery place, his dogged wordes amayne. VVith clothes in colour Iron lyke. his members haue they clad: That from some fire of cursed corps, they lately taken had: And least that on the ground too bare, his head should lye alone Not borne vp, there vnder they doe lay a hard Flint stone. And then they ready to depart, doe make amid the place, A fier of greene wood, which they put vnto his nose and face. As sone as he did feele the smoke, he gan aloude to crie: To whom then forthwith thus did speake, one of the sisters three. VVe moue to thee these weeping weales for euer to endure: VVhich alway shal for cause inough fal from thee, be thou sure. Thus did she say, and Clotho bad, hir promise firme to stande: And forthwith span a cole blacke thred, with hir vnlucky hande: And for bicause she list not tel long destenies before, Of all thy facts (quoth she) there shall a Prophet tell thee more: That Prophete sure am I, of me thou shalt thy mischiefes know: So that the Gods so ne of their skyll would on my wordes bestow. God graunt the things I wish to thee. may to my verse agree: VVhich thou amid thy dolor mayst, approue right true to be. And that without examples olde, thou haue not thine annoy. God graunt thy mischiefes be no lesse, than those that hapt to Troy. And in thy thigh as great a wound, with poysoned shotte mayst haue: As Peas sonne, twhom Hercules his bowe and arrowes gaue. And grievd no lesse than he that suckt, a Hart in time tofore: VVho armed, with vnarmed hande was wounded very sore. Or he that headlong fell from horse, in conutryes straunge to ground: VVhom comly personage almost, did vtterly confound. And mayst see as Amintors sonne, who trembling gropt his way: VVith nothing els saue with his staffe without the light of day. Nor mayst beholde no more than he, whose daughter did him guide: VVhose wickednes his father, and his mother both hath tryde. And that thou mayst be such, as he, who iudgd the ioconde strife: VVho after in Apollos arte, was famous during life. And that thou mayst be such as he who did commaunde a Doue: To conduct safe the goodly shippe, that Pallas much dyd loue. Or he who lackt his eyes with which he naughtly gold hath kende: VVhome to hir sonne a sacryfyce, the Mother greude dyd sende. Or as Th'Ætnean shepeherd was, to whome was prophesied: By Telemus, Eurimous sonne, what after should betyde, Or Phyneus his two sonnes, from whom who gaue to them the same: He toke their eyes, or Thamyras, or Demodoce of fame. Or that some may thy members cut as did Saturnus olde: VVho those parts, wherby he was formd, to cut away was bolde. That Neptune in the swelling seas, no better be to thee: Than vnto him, who saw his wife, and brother, bird to be. Or else vnto the skylful man, whome holding in his hand The peeces of his broken barke, dyd Ino helpe to land. And that not one alone may know, thys kynde of punishment: God graunt thy members may with horse in peeces all be rent. And that thy paynes may be as greate as of Amylcars hande He felt, the which would haue redemde none of the Romane bande, And that no power that heauen holds, may be to thee more ayde: Than Iupiter Herceus altar was, to Priam sore afrayde. Or as kyng Thessalus from toppe of Ossa hyl was cast: So thou mayst from some stony clyfte, be headlong flong as fast. Or that thy lyms may feede the snakes, as dyd Eurialus, VVho dyd the regal scepter hold, after kyng Thessalus. That water hot powrde on thy head, may be to thee the cause Of shortning of thy fatall lyfe, as it to Minos was. Or else as wycked Prometheus, thou mayst be tyed fast Vnto some hyl, vppon whose flesh, the byrds may haue repast. Or else that being slaine thou mayst into the sea be sent: As Etracides from Hercules, the fyftenth by discent. Or that as Phillip was, thou mayst with cruel sword be slayne: Of him, whome thou in beastly sort, to loue doest not dysdayne. Or that as faythlesse cups to thee thy seruitors may profer: As vnto hym who was the sonne, of horned Iupiter. That hanging as Acheus dyd, thy lyfe thou mayst not holde, VVho wretched man by corde was tyed influd that flowes with golde. Or that a Tyle vpon thy head, from enmies hand may fall: As to Achilles nephew, whom men famous Pyrrhus cal. And that thy bones may restlesse lye, as Pyrrhus were be tost, VVho long did lye vnburied, about Ambrasia coast. Or as king Hieros daughter was, with dartes thou mayst be slayne: No doubt this deede to Ceres would be acceptable playne. Or as the Neuew of the king, of whom before we spake: Thou poyson of Cantharides, of parents hand mayst take. Or that some vile Adultresse may the name of godly gayne: By killing thee, as she who hath, the traytour Leucon slayne. And that into some burning fire, with thee thy selfe mayst cast Thy dearest things, which end of life, Sardanalus past. Or as those were that Ammons church, to spoyle did take in hande: By violence of Southerne blastes, mayst couerd be with sande. And that a heape of ashes may, thy cursed bones possesse: As it did theirs whom Ochus slew, by gylefull craftinesse. As him that raignde in Sicion, with Oliues fruitful soyle: God graunt that cold and hunger to, thee of thy life may spoyle. And that as one Acarnus sonne, inclosed for despight: In bullocks skinne, thou mayst be borne into thyne enmies sight. And that as Alexander did, in bed mayst lose thy life: His wife to him the deadly stroke did giue by bloudy knife. That those whom thou dost faythful thinke, (as erst Alebas found Larissian king) thou mayst them try, skant faithful by thy wound. As Milo to, which tyrant fel, did Pisa much torment: Aliue into the waters deepe, all headlong mayst be sent. Or that as Adimantus proude Philetian king was slayne: So Iupiter with thunderboltes, may worke to thee like payne, Or els as Dionisius, who from Amastrix fled: So thou though in Achilles course, forsaken mayst be dead. Or that about Thrasillus tombe, as did Euridamas, Fast tyed about Larissian whele, thou there mayst three times passe. Or els like Hector valiaunt, whose body vewd the wal, That he had long in safety kept, which after sone did fal. As daughter of Hippomenes, new torments did abide: And as th'adulterer was drawen ouer Athens land so wide: So when thy hated life of al, thy lothed limmes shal leaue: God graunt that hungry horses may thy corps in peeces reaue. That some man may thy body thrust on rockes, much tost before: As were the bodyes of the Grekes, on Caphareus shore. And that with Thunderboltes &amp; seas, as Aiax ferce dyd dye, God graunt that so the fyre may ayde, the waters drowning thee. And that also with furyes tost, thy mynde may be as mad As his, whose body ouer all, one onely wound hath had. And as Lycurgus Dryas sonne that Thracyan kyngdoms helde, VVho cut his legs whyle he assayd the vine trees to haue fellde. Lyke Hercules, and Dragons sonne, that such may be thy fate: Lyke Tyssamenes father too, and Callyrboës mate. And that thy hap may gayne a wyfe, no chaster than was she: Of whome the olde Tydeus myght ryght sore ashamed be. Or she of Locris, who dyd with hir husbands brother lye, VVho for to colour this hir facte, dyd cause hir mayde to dye. The Gods do graunt to thee a wyfe, of equal fayth also: As had Talaus sonne in lawe, and Tyndarus, his to. And lyke king Neces neeces, who theyr vncles sonnes durst kyll: VVhose shoulders are tormented sore with water caryage styll. That syster thyne may burne as dyd Byblis and Canace: And that but onely in doing yl, she faythful be to thee. That thy child be to thee, as to Thiestes, Pelope: Or Mirrha was vnto hir Sire, or els Nictmene. And that thy daughter vnto thee, as faithlesse found may be: As thine was to thee Pterela, or Nisus thine to thee: Or she who by hir cruel deede, reprochful made the place: VVhere ouer hir fathers body slayne: she draue hir cart apace. Or that thou mayst be slayne, as were the lusty youthes too bolde. VVhose heades were sette on Pisa gates, that al might them beholde. Or he (which iuster was) who with his blood bedewd the ground: Besprinkled erst, with blood that came from wretched woe s wounde. Or as the carter that betrayd, the Tyrant bloudy wight: VVho gaue newe names vnto the sea, that nowe Mictonum hight. Or those that sought in vayne to haue, the mayden swifte as winde: Till she by gathering Apples three: was some what lefte behinde. Or as the men that went into the combrouse house with payne: VVherin the monster strange was kept whence none could come. Or as the bodyes twelue were cast into the flaming fire: VVhich was Achilles angry worke, enrag'd almost for ire. Or those, of whom we read by Sphynx a cruell death haue founde, If they his doubtful questions were not able to expounde. Or as the men which in the church of Bystone Pallas dyde, For which offence the Goddesse yet hir face doth also hyde. Or as the men that long agoe, the stately cribbes be bledde, Of Thracian king, vppon whose fleshe, his hungry horses fedde.

As he that after long drouth, did yll sacred rytes deuise: VVho to get rayne, was made himselfe, a bloudy sacrifice. Or as Antheus brother hath, with propre bloud be bled The altars (as was right) syth he, likewise had others shed. As he that fedde his terrible horse, with flesh of many kild: In steade of grasse or hay that growes abrode amid the fielde. Or those two, who at diuers times, by one to death were done: I meane he Centaure Nessus, and Dissimanus hys sonne. Or as thy neuew Neptune, whome surrendryng vp his ghost, Dyd Nymphe Coronis sonne behold, from out his propre coast. As Sinis, Sciron, and with them, Poliphemons sonne to: And he whose body was halfe man, and halfe a Bull also. Or he who men fast tied to boughs, from ground did cast on hye: Of this sea or of that thou mayst, the surging waues espye.

That such as Achimenides, forsakte on Sicill shore, Thou mayest be: when he did spye the Troyan fleete tofore. Like Irus els with double name, that such thy state may be: Or those that hold the bridge, the which shall greater be by thee. And that dame Ceres sonne may be belou'd of thee in vayne: So that he ofte required may, thy prayers styll dysdayne. And as the sand hy ebbes and fluds of waters come and gone: Is washt away from vnder foote that hard is set thereon. So graunt the Gods, that al thy goods (I know not where they are) May fall away euen through thy hands, and thou be left but bare. And lyke hir syre that could hir selfe, to sundry shapes transpose: (Though belly full) with hunger pynde, that thou thy lyfe mayst lose., That of mans flesh thou think no scorn, to feede amid thy rage: In which point onely thou shalt be the Tideus of our age.

I wish that with thy fatall brand, a fyre be kindled so. As by Medeas crowne was burnt, the new betrothed spouse, And as hir father was with hir, and eke with him the house. As poysoned blood crept in the limmes of Hercules the great: I wish that so a body vyle may all thy members eate. That also thou mayst feele the like newe kinde of punishment: As to reuenge his father did Licurgus sonne inuente. Or that to cleaue an Oke thou mayst (as Nilo did) assay: And haue no power at al to plucke, thy taken handes away.

Or that thou mayst no better rest, (than Rhesus had) obtaine, Or else his company the day before that they were slayne. Or those which with Ramnetes bolde, by quicke Hirtacus sonne And his companion alone, to cruel death were done. Or that the house inclosde with fire, as Clicias sonne maist haue: So that thou mayst halfe burned beare thy members to thy graue. Or else I wish that weapons rude, vpon thy head may fall: As erst on Remus ouer bolde to clime thn'vfinisht wall. And last I pray that thou mayst liue and dy in these same partes: Among the cruel Sarmates, and cruell Getes dartes, These things in sodaine mode thus pend to thee directed bee: That thou neede not complaine that I vnmindful am of thee. They are but few, I graunt, but God can giue my prayers more, And with his fauour my requestes can multiply with store. Hereafter thou much more shalt reade wherein shal bee thy name: And in such verse as men are wont such cruel warres to frame. FINIS.</field>
