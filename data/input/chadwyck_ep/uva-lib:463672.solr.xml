      <field name="fulltext">THE AVCTHORS Commemoration for MVNDAY. [Behold this worldly wretchednesse] Behold this worldly wretchednesse, Of euils which euer vs possesse. The Translators Application. First when Thalmighty prouidence dyd heauen and earth create, An vniuersall darknesse dyd them both obtenebrate: Then likte the Lorde to make a light deuided from darknesse, The darknesse should night signifie, the light should day expresse. [This day therfore darknesse mundame] This day therfore darknesse mundame, Eschevve and vvalke in light oh man. [This volume breefe of sclender quantitie] This volume breefe of sclender quantitie, Called, of sinners the contemplation. Accordeth well for eche state and degree, Guiding by grace and due direction. Our Soule to sease in sure saluation, Therefore this tytle profoundly knowyng: VVhich of thy conscience may cause correction, In hart emprint, with matter folowyng. [These sentences before resemble by figure] These sentences before resemble by figure, The world as it were set in the salt See: VVhose perillous passage as in portrature, Explaneth mearely cares and calamitee. VVherevnto is subiect, eche state and degree, For as the Sea is euer in commotion: VVith raging storme, and perillous perplexitee. So is this world wallowyng in confusion. [Eche sentence here of foresayd Scripture] Eche sentence here of foresayd Scripture, Sheweth Sunne, Moone, and Starres to our sight. To haue been enuironed with cloudes obscure, Dimmed with darknes, which somtime blased bright. So in the world some estates lacke the light, Of grace, in maner of lyfe and religion: The day of Vertue turnyng into night, So blinde in wicked worldly abusion. [O wicked world wrapped in wretchednesse] O wicked world wrapped in wretchednesse, Fye on thy fraude and fickle felicitie: Fye on thy balefull blundred businesse, Thy blandeshing blindnesse in prosperitie. Hedged with Hawthorne, care, and calamity, VVith drede, dolour, and double disease: Thy pleasant poyson slayth soule and body, So rewardest thou such as seeke thee to please. [O polisant graue and donghill clad with snawe] O polisant graue and donghill clad with snawe, Thou sister to Sodome, and seate to Sathanas, Thy likyng lustes last but for a thrawe, Thou tyrant treasonable, and germaine to Iudas. VVhom thou canst kisse, salute, and imbrace, By honor, ritches, delight, and dignitie: As Iudas betrayed Christe with flattering face, His soule thou seazest in endles captiuitie. [That prudent prince, and wyse kyng Salomon] That prudent prince, and wyse kyng Salomon, Preferred his pleasance in such proued plentee: For honor, ritches, delites, and renoune, He had no peare, so surpassed hee. Raignyng in all most royall felicitie, Natheles his state, he sayd, for conclusion: VVas of no force, but meare vanitie, Through corporall toyle, and spirituall affliction. [Some are so choked with worldly businesse] Some are so choked with worldly businesse, Both Spiritual and Temporal, as time doth oft shevv They haue but small care of Hell or heauenlinesse, To saue them selues they are vvoonderous slovve. Such study not hovv their concience for to knavv, As a Spider fighteth to catche a Flee: Making her net, vvhich faileth vvith a flavve, Such sell their soules for vaine prosperitee. [O strong tyrant, traytour right treasonable] O strong tyrant, traytour right treasonable, Conuent of all contagious company: Thy faded florishing is Fantasie fayleable, Thou graue of guile, schoole of cupidity. Father of falshood, nurse of iniquitie, The changeable chaunce of thy foolish renovvne: Oppressing the lust, placing euill men on hie, Maketh many to loose an incorruptible crovvne. [That morall man, and famous Philosopher] That morall man, and famous Philosopher, Foure thinges commendeth befitting a king: To his disciple Traiane the Emperour, Fyrst dreade and loue God aboue all thyng. Next of his person haue discreete gouernyng, Then see that his officers be true and diligent, Lastly his subiectes euer defendyng. Shall winne theyr loue, as conquest congruent. [In weyghty matters geue personall presence] In weyghty matters geue personall presence, In smaller actions geuyng commission, To men of fayth, good name, and sapience, Iustice to keepe without exception. As they wyll answere to God and your crowne, And take inquest how iustly they proceede, VVithout feede or fauour, or cloked correction, Then graunt them dome accordyng to deede. [So dyd Cambises, which of Persia was kyng] So dyd Cambises, which of Persia was kyng, Geuing afray to officers of inftry, Vpon a Iudge he made such punishing, Because he handled his office vntruely. Causd his skinne to be rent from the body, And on the seate where he gaue sentment, Made stretch it foorth for lastyng memory, Placing his sonne to sitte in iudgement. [VVere in a kyng such disposition kend] VVere in a kyng such disposition kend, That he would iust men promote and cherishe, And from his Court and Counsell suspend, Such as are knowen corrupters of iustice. And open malefactors suffer in no wyse, That should stablishe iustice, policy, and peace, Causing good order into the Realme to ryse, And make euill men soone from their sinne to cease. [Nowe then would Princes to Churchly promotion] Nowe then would Princes to Churchly promotion, Aduaunce none other, but men of suffisance, VVhich truely should keepe their state and profession, Seeking soules health without dissimulance. Gracious and godly in their gouernace, So might Princes in fame and meede increase, Causyng the Cleargy keepe good obseruance, should bridle many from hurtful blindnes. [And as a Prince hath cheefe correction] And as a Prince hath cheefe correction, On spirituall state, so may his hygh prudence, Into the Church cause reformation, By fauourable meanes of princely excellence. For all his Realme to him geues attendance, so dyd Iosaphat which was kyng of Iury, His whole empyre by his great diligence, He causd to keepe the lawe of God duely. [Then should God in eche state honoured bee] Then should God in eche state honoured bee, Hereby might men both grace and glory obteyne, Iustice should raigne with peace and policee, And trouth returne with triumph home ageyne. VVhich is exilde, and almost forlore cleane, Thus might men liue in great securitie, And loue theyr God, which doth eche state sustayne, VVere Vertue captayne of theyr cheualry. [Thus sythen in earth amongst men mortall] Eche Subiect should ay, For his Soueraigne pray Thus sythen in earth amongst men mortall, The weale and woe of euery region, Dependes vpon the Kyng most principall, Therefore we should with true intention, Beseeche Christe Iesu with deuotion, All mortall sinne that he may put aside, And efte in heauen, as with his benediction, So eake on earth would eache good prince guide. [But where some Princes and leaders of the lawe] But where some Princes and leaders of the lawe, Breake fayth to God by lost alleageance, Their ciuill iustice must suffer ouerthrawe, This vertue Iustice is made intemperance. VVhom grace not guiding, keepes none obseruance, VVhat Prince to Poore keepes Iustice without lesing Hearing complaint with good deliuerance, In Heauen and Earth he shall be floreshing. [As Iustice is cause of peace and policie] As Iustice is cause of peace and policie, And VVell of welfare in euery Region, So without Iustice Kingdomes feele contrarie, For robberie, theft, pouerty, and oppression, Murmure, discord, and desolation, Confiskes many a Kingdome ane huge Impery, From theyr late former good condicion, For want of Iustice through iniquity. [In England then, trueth shewe thy stately style] In England then, trueth shewe thy stately style, And Iustice thou thy Baner brode display, All leagerdy maynes from hence quite exile, Graunt God that good meaning mainteined be may All subtyll shiftes to conuince and bewray, VVherewith the couetous encombred bee, Least that the great flee the small eatyng alway, Doo the same deuoure by lawles libertee, [Farre from vs, O God, expell corrupt iustice] Farre from vs, O God, expell corrupt iustice, VVith couetousnesse and false affection. That goodnesse of eache cause may full suffise, To try it selfe cleare in the action, Of euill buddes let no bitter abusion, Make crooked causes cloked to bee, In Consistory Court, or Ciuill Session, But graunt, O GOD, to trueth the victory. [To Kyng without colour that lyst to keepe Iustice] To Kyng without colour that lyst to keepe Iustice, The nearest way most honorable and easie, Ys corrupt men to suffer in no wyse, By false affection or parcialitie, To execute the office of Iustice duely, And yf in this poynt a Prince be negligent, His mind perswaded may be fully, He shall incurre Gods dreedfull iudgement. [Nowe Princes, Lordes, and Nobles of renowne] Nowe Princes, Lordes, and Nobles of renowne, VVhom it pleaseth to vse Iustice with mercie, Take Iob and Dauid examples to your crowne, VVhen to the poore they had a piteous eye, And of mighty offenders punisht peruersitee, VVhom Gods good grace hath remunerate VVith blessinges moe then may expressed bee, In lasting fame ay to be Lawreate. [Our hope, our happe, we set in worldlines] Our hope, our happe, we set in worldlines, And men with men defraude in vvhite and black, Corrupting conscience, all daring in darknes, In our conceiptes as vve should aye hold svvack, Our crazed Cables all at a cast vvyll crack, Yf God so please his stormes but once to steare, VVherefore in time for our misse, mendes lets make, And stand vve fast, els perishe vve in feare. [There is no reason our misrule can arrest] There is no reason our misrule can arrest, This vvretched vvord so farre vvakes our vvitte, Invvard to vvysedome our vvyls vve doo not vvrest, For Couetis hath vs in his chaine so knitte, And vvicked examples of sinners can vs tvvit, VVhat resteth more, vve shrinke not to trespas, From this guilefull vvorld, as vve should neuer flitt, But our vvylles vve vvorke, tyll out run be our glas. [Therefore I counsell eache christian creature] Therefore I counsell eache christian creature, In vvorldly vvayes his mind to modefy, To liue in trueth iustly, and not to iniure, Yea and vvith glad pacience to vvelcome aduersity, VVith dreade and temperance vsing prosperity, Thinking this vvorld a throughfare of vvo, VVhat euer God send, blesse him ay gladly, As vve vvere Pilgrimes passing to and fro. FINIS Of the Contemplacion for MVNDAY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE AVCTORS Commemoration for TVESDAY. [The state of innocencie heare] The state of innocencie heare, Continually in mind lets beare. The Translators Application. The second day a Firmament, the Lord God dyd ordeyne, VVaters aboue, as wel as vnder, to deuide in twayne, The vpper Firmament Heauen cald, the neathermost Earth is, The Mornyng and the Euennnng cleare, he let be made with this. [The state of innocencie cleare] The state of innocencie cleare, In mind and maners let appeare. [The Aucthor figured here by the portrature] The Aucthor figured here by the portrature, Of Adam and Eue our parentes innocence, VVhen they a time in God his grace stood sure, Before their fall, he geues intelligence, Howe we should frame our liues with diligence, To the recouerie of our lost heritage, To God and Man eschewing all offence, By lyfe innocent of eche estate and age. [Right as white paper is redy to the print] Right as white paper is redy to the print, Of blacke and blew faire and foule Imagery, So is the soule of man conuenient, To good and euill addict vndoubtedly, But sythen Vertue hath suche difficulty, Men learne the sooner to be vicious. In lacke of labour we flowe in folly, For slothfull sottes can not be vertuous. [VVhat seede men sowe, such corne they must sheare] VVhat seede men sowe, such corne they must sheare, As we oft see by prooued experience, Euen so in youth, who liketh to forbeare, The seedes of sinne, of slothe, and negligence, And sowe the seedes of vertue and sapience, So with small labour in great security, VVith mede honor and inward compacience, Theit age shall florishe in fayre felicity. [The tyme os sowing is called tedious] The tyme os sowing is called tedious, But of the reaping svveete is the seasoune, So of good life beginnyng is laborous, Then folovveth fruite of honour and renoune, Euerlasting life, and eke an heauenly crowne, Therefore, O youth, in these thy yeeres greene, Fyght feruently vvith harty affection, And tyre not that triumph eternall to obtayne. [But novve alacke youthy yeeres and innocence] But novve alacke youthy yeeres and innocence, To vice and vertue vvhich is indifferent, So soked is in sinne and insolence, Through euill examples, and liberty verament, That of youthy yeeres time is mispent.

[Among the plagues of Egypt most horrible] Among the plagues of Egypt most horrible, One was of darknes three dayes enduring, VVhich was a token troublesome and terrible, To all the Egyptians: but there abiding, The people of Israel had large light shining, So though this world be blinded by abusance, Yet amongst all some be in grace growyng, To innocent lyfe, through fruitefull repentance.

[As nothing more maketh resemblance] As nothing more maketh resemblance, To feendish feares then strife and debate, So humane kinde by charitable acquaintance, To heauenly Angels is associate. This laudable loue makes man laureate, Loue makes our labour light in comparison, Loue is a vertue of valure inuiolate, And chaungeth care to consolation. [Thy corporall health from sicknesse to conserue] Thy corporall health from sicknesse to conserue, Is more of prise then any medecine, So then thy soule may rather deserue, Of deadly wound all sinne for to decline. Then for to taste the venemous propine Of sinne, and after seeke the salue of repentance, Presumption ryseth of the olde serpentine, VVhiche doubtles doth proue a perillous pestelance. [Of our soules Lord we make record with ruthe] Of our soules Lord we make record with ruthe, As flowres fayre, tender, and delicate, To Christe our spouse wedded with ring of truthe, Though in this life we haue dayly debate, Yet graunt in fayth that we be laureate, From hurtfull sinne with syncere conscience, O Lord to thee let vs not liue ingrate, Sithe thou with vs wolte haue thy residence.

[Awake out of thy dreame, and speedely addres] Awake out of thy dreame, and speedely addres, Thee to beware in tyme, eare thou feele woe, Though blinded thou liue here with thy ritches, Yet thincke thou shalt this lyfe and them forgoe: VVhere in the end yf thou this race runne so, That sinne and vice by thee may be subdued, Thou shalt no doubt vanquishe eche feendishe fo, And with eternall blessing be endued. [Sythen wee see in sicknesse corporall] Sythen wee see in sicknesse corporall, Health to recouer, and death for to decline. Men wyll absteyne from lustes sensuall, And their desyres submit to medecine: All for this frayle flesh that runneth to ruine, How much more should eche man with busy cure, Seeke for the soules health, repentyngin time, VVherby he may obteyne such ioyes as shalendure. [Slombring in sinne some dreame security] Slombring in sinne some dreame security, VVithout feare or forecast of infernall afliction, Neglecting repentance in this lyfe transitory, That they feare nothing the due correction, Ordeyned for sinne by deuine direction, As those that are not carefull harmes to eschewe. Suche feele the sentence of all malediction, VVhen repentance come to late their sorowes to rescewe. [VVith this foresayd action I reade right ernestfull] VVith this foresayd action I reade right ernestfull, Repentantly into thy hart imprint, Lhy state with teares bemone, as most wofull. VVith contrite hart, doo now thy sinnes lament, And wheretofore euyll custome by consent, Of selfewyll, dyd cause wickednesse abound, Let hencefoorth grace amend thy lyfe present, That lyfe to come with ioyes may thee redound.

The Translators Application. Thalmighty woorkeman ended now, his worke which he dyd frame, Resting from woorke he blest this day, and sanctified the same. As one that greatly dyd reioyce, to see all thinges so well, VVith glory infinite he restes, where Saintes and Angels dwell. [This Sabbothes rest to keepe let vs.] This Sabbothes rest to keepe let vs. To enioy Heauens ioyes most precious. [Ther is perfection and flowre of al fairenes] Ther is perfection and flowre of al fairenes, VVhere simplest stuffe is gold and precious stone, There is small felicitie euermore faultles, VVhose pleasures there surpasse all mencion: There Christe our king for the saluacion, Of those that liue in his feare and him loue, Cælestiall ioyes preparde hath many a one, For ay to dure, in glorious Heauen aboue. [VVho would be carefull, with deuoute diligence] VVho would be carefull, with deuoute diligence, Digestly to thincke on the ioyes celestiall, Might well discerne by true intelligence, That worldly pleasure is of price but small: VVhich as deceitfull, would nought esteeme at all, VVhen he dooth behold with great security, That precious Pallace and place imperiall, Ordeyned for Christes elect eternally. [VVhen men to things temporall doo beare affection] VVhen men to things temporall doo beare affection, They least esteeme of euerduring blisse, VVherevpon in nature ryseth such corruption, That oft who on earth most prosperous is: Of the heauenly beautitude most of all mis, Their carnall lust a bondage dooth become, To them selues, who then would consider of this, For transitorie pleasure should eternall paines shone. [VVe shall in the heauens, of God haue inspection] VVe shall in the heauens, of God haue inspection, In soule and body endowred with dignity, Yea and in this bodyly shape shall we haue cognition, Eche one of other, before Gods great maiesty: VVhen as thus glorified in soule and eke in body, Such ioyes shall we taste, and endles consolation, That in the midst, our sauiour triumphing with victory VVe shall shine seuen times more dearer then the son. [Nathles in respect of that eternall glory] Nathles in respect of that eternall glory, All worldly ioy is but fond ianglyng, And beauty braue is but deformity, Sweete thinges are sowre, myrth, very mournyng, Or what so euer other delectable thyng, All is required but payne in comparison, And worldly wealth is very vomentyng, In respect of heauenly store of graces many one. [VVhen humane soule her selfe so dooth demene] VVhen humane soule her selfe so dooth demene, That she loues death, and leaues lyfe spirituall, Both God she then forgetteth quite and cleane, Vertue dispisde, she flowes in sinnes sensuall, Contemning Christe, obayes to Belyall, And what her selfe is, eke forgetting she, For heauenly ioy, feeles sorowes infernall, For life she tastes death then perpetually. [Resume thy strength nowe as a knight spirituall] Resume thy strength nowe as a knight spirituall, Fyght for the heauen, winne it with diligence, The fende, the fleshe, and vyces mundyall, Quite to subuert, by deuyne sapience, If weake thou be, craue God for thy defence, Hauing good hope by Gods prouision, Through watchfull care, and humble pacience, VVith tryumph thou shalt win an heauenly crowne. [Remember man this solace shalbe sure] Remember man this solace shalbe sure, Altogeather voyde of worldly variaunce, It shall without dreade or distance ay endure, But in this lyfe is no continuance: Ritches, pouertie, lyfe, and death, are but a traunce, VVherefore in this worldly mutable estate, Let vs seeke to liue after God his ordinaunce, Least of that lasting blis, we make our selues frustrate. [Nowe Heauens and Earth for witnes in I call] Nowe Heauens and Earth for witnes in I call, How God disposeth for mans direction, Perpetuall payne, and ioy celestiall, Vertue, vice, health, and perdition: Put to our choyse by free election, VVherefore our hartes and eyes lets eleuate, To God, the geuer of all grace deuine, Of him to craue, that he the fyrme estate, Of lastyng blisse would graunt vs all in fine, FINIS Of the Contemplacion for SONDAY.</field>
