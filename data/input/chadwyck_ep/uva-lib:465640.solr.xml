THE SECOND EDITION, CORRECTED AND ENLARGED. “Salve, magna parens frugum, Saturnia tellus, “Magna virum! tibi res antiquæ laudis, et artes “Ingredior, sanctos ausus recludere fontes.” Virg. “Our Sight is the most perfect, and most delightful of all our senses. It fills the mind with the largest variety of ideas, converses with its objects at the greatest distance, and continues the longest in action without being tired, or satiated with its proper enjoyment.” Spect. N? 411, On the Pleasures of Imagination. BOOK I. MORNING. Argument to Book the First. The Subject propos'd. Address. Ascent to the Hill. General View. Comparison. Philosophical Account of the Origin and Formation of Mountains, &amp;c. Morning View, comprehending the South-West Part of the Scene, interspers'd with Elements and Examples of rural Taste; shewing, at the same Time, its Connexion with, and Dependance upon Civil Government; and concluding with an Historical Episode of the Red-Horse. Britannia's rural charms, and tranquil scenes, Far from the circling ocean, where her fleets, Like Milton. Paradise Lost, Book iv. Eden's nightly guards, majestic ride, I sing; O may the theme and kindred soil Propitious prove, and to th'appointed hill Invite the Muses from their cloister'd shades, With me to rove, and harmonize the strain! Nor shall they, for a time, regret the loss Of their lov'd Isis, and fair Cherwel's stream, While to the north of their own beauteous fields The pictur'd scene they view, where Avon shapes His winding way, enlarging as it flows, Nor hastes to join Sabrina's prouder wave. Like a tall rampart! here the mountain rears Its verdant edge; and, if the tuneful Maids Their presence deign, shall with Parnassus vie. Level, and smooth the track, which thither leads! Of champaign bold and fair! Its adverse side Abrupt, and steep! Thanks, Miller Sanderson Miller, Esquire, of Radway.! to thy paths, That ease our winding steps! Thanks to the fount, The trees, the flow'rs, imparting to the sense Fragrance or dulcet sound of murm'ring rill, And stilling ev'ry tumult in the breast! And oft the stately tow'rs, that overtop The rising wood, and oft the broken arch, Or mould'ring wall, well taught to counterfeit The waste of time, to solemn thought excite, And crown with graceful pomp the shaggy hill. See Lord Shaftsbury's Judgment of Hercules.So Virtue paints the steep ascent to fame: So her aerial residence displays. Still let thy friendship, which prepar'd the way, Attend, and guide me, as my ravish'd sight O'er the bleak hill, or shelter'd valley roves. Teach me with just observance to remark Their various charms, their storied fame record, And to the visual join the mental search. The summit's gain'd! and, from its airy height, The late-trod plain looks like an inland sea, View'd from some promontory's hoary head, With distant shores environ'd; not with face Glassy, and uniform, but when its waves Are gently ruffled by the southern gale, And the tall masts like waving forests rise. Such is the scene! that, from the terrac'd hill, Displays its graces; intermixture sweet Of lawns and groves, of open and retir'd. Vales, farms, towns, villas, castles, distant spires, And hills on hills, with ambient clouds enrob'd, In long succession court the lab'ring sight, Lost in the bright confusion. Thus the youth, Escap'd from painful drudgery of words, Views the fair fields of science wide display'd; Where Phoebus dwells, and all the tuneful Nine; Perplext awhile he stands, and now to this, Now that blest seat of harmony divine Explores his way, with giddy rapture tir'd: Till some sage Mentor, whose experienc'd feet Have trod the mazy path, directs his search, And leads him wond'ring to their bright abodes. Come then, my Friend! guide thou th'advent'rous Muse, And, with thy counsel, regulate her flight. Yet, ere the sweet excursion she begins, O! listen, while, from sacred records drawn, My daring song unfolds the cause, whence rose This various face of things—of high, and low— Of rough, and smooth. For with its parent earth Coeval not prevail'd what now appears Of hill and dale; nor was its new-form'd shape, Like a smooth, polish'd orb, a surface plain, Wanting the sweet variety of change, Concave, convex, the deep, and the sublime: Nor, from old Ocean's watry bed, were scoop'd Its neighb'ring shores; nor were they now depress'd, Now rais'd by sudden shocks; but fashion'd all In perfect harmony, by Amongst the many fanciful conceits of writers on the subject, a learned Divine, in his Confutation of Dr. Burnett's Theory, supposes that hills and mountains might be occasioned by fermentation, after the manner of leaven in dough; while others have attributed their production to the several different causes mentioned above. The following solution, by the descent of water from the surface of the earth to the center, seem'd most easy, and natural to the author, and is therefore adopted. Vid. Warren's Geologiæ, 1698. laws divine, On passive matter, at its birth impress'd. WHEN now two days, as mortals count their time, Th'Almighty had employ'd on man's abode; To motion rous'd the dead, inactive mass, The dark illumin'd, and the parts terrene Impelling each to each, the circle form'd, Compact, and firm, of earth's stupendous orb, With boundless seas, as with a garment cloath'd, On the third morn he bade the waters flow Down to their place, and let dry land appear; And it was so. Strait to their destin'd bed, From every part, th'obedient waters ran, Shaping their downward course, and, as they found Resistance varying with the varying soil, In their retreat they form'd the gentle slope, Or headlong precipice, or deep-worn dale, Or valley, stretching far its winding maze, As farther still their humid train they led, By Heav'n directed to the Called in scripture, the deep, the great deep, the deep that lieth under, or beneath the earth—the Tartarus or Erebus of the Heathens. realms below. Now first was seen the variegated face Of earth's fair orb shap'd by the plastic flood: Now smooth and level like its liquid plains, Now, like its ruffled waves, sweet interchange Of hill and dale, and now a rougher scene, Mountains on mountains lifted to the sky. Such was her infant form, yet unadorn'd! And in the naked soil the subtle ?So the watry throng With serpent error wand'ring found their way, And on the washy ooze deep channels wore. Easy! ere God had bid the ground be dry, All but within those banks, where rivers now Stream, and perpetual draw their humid train. Milton. Paradise Lost, Book vii. stream Fretted its winding track. So He ordain'd! Who form'd the fluid mass of atoms small, The principles of things! who moist from dry, From heavy sever'd light, compacting close The solid glebe, stratum of rock, or ore, Or crumbly marl, or close tenacious clay, Or what beside, in wond'rous order rang'd, Orb within orb, earth's secret depths contains. So was the shapely sphere, on ev'ry side, With equal pressure of surrounding air Sustain'd, of sea and land harmonious form'd. Nor beauteous cov'ring was withheld, for strait, At the divine command, the verd'rous grass Upsprang unsown, with ev'ry seedful herb, Fruit, plant, or tree, pregnant with future store; God saw the whole—And lo! 'twas very good. But man, ungrateful man! to deadly ill Soon turn'd the good bestow'd, with horrid crimes Polluting earth's fair seat, his Maker's gift! Till mercy cou'd no more with justice strive. Then wrath divine unbarr'd Heav'n's watry gates, And loos'd the fountains of the great abyss. Again the waters o'er the earth prevail'd. Hills rear'd their heads in vain. Full forty days The flood increas'd, nor, till sev'n moons had wan'd, Appear'd the mountain-tops. Perish'd all flesh, One family except! and all the works Of Art were swept into th'oblivious pool. In that dread time what change th'avenging flood Might cause in earth's devoted fabric, who Of mortal birth can tell? Whether again 'Twas to its first chaotic According to Mr. Hutchinson and his followers. mass reduc'd, To be reform'd anew? or, in its orb, What violence, what According to Dr. Burnett's Theory. disruptions it endur'd? What ancient mountains stood the furious shock? What new arose? For doubtless new there are, If all are not; strong proof exhibiting Of later rise, and their once fluid state, By stranger-fossils, in their inmost bed Of looser mould, or marble rock entomb'd, Or shell marine, incorp'rate with themselves: Nor less the There are some remarkable traces of the great event here treated of, in each of these kinds, at Welcombe, near Stratford upon Avon, formerly a seat of the Combe family, the whole scene bearing the strongest marks of some violent conflict of Nature, and particularly of the agency of water. conic hill, with ample base, Or scarry There are some remarkable traces of the great event here treated of, in each of these kinds, at Welcombe, near Stratford upon Avon, formerly a seat of the Combe family, the whole scene bearing the strongest marks of some violent conflict of Nature, and particularly of the agency of water. slope by rushing billows torn, Or There are some remarkable traces of the great event here treated of, in each of these kinds, at Welcombe, near Stratford upon Avon, formerly a seat of the Combe family, the whole scene bearing the strongest marks of some violent conflict of Nature, and particularly of the agency of water. fissure deep, in the late delug'd soil Cleft by succeeding drought, side answering side, And curve to adverse curve exact oppos'd, Confess the watry pow'r; while scatter'd trains, Or rocky fragments, wash'd from broken hills, Take up the tale, and spread it round the globe.

The reader may see this hypothesis very ably supported by Mr. Catcot, in his Essay on the Deluge, 2d edit. together with many respectable names, ancient and modern, by whom it is patronized. The following passage from Lucretius is quoted by him, as well expressing their general meaning. Partim quod subter per terras diditur omnes. Percolatur enim virus, retroque remanat Materies humoris, et ad caput amnibus omnis Convenit, unde super terras fluit agmine dulci, Quà via secta semel liquido pede detulit undas. round. So up the porous stone, or crystal tube The philosophic eye with wonder views The tinctur'd fluid rise; so tepid dews From chymic founts in copious streams distil. Such is the structure, such the wave-worn face Of Earth's huge fabric! beauteous to the sight, Trees of a very large size, torn up by the roots, and other vegetable and animal bodies, the spoils of the deluge, are found in every part of the earth, but chiefly in fens, or bogs, or amongst peat-earth, which is an assemblage of decayed vegetables. See Woodward's Nat. Hist. of the Earth, &amp;c.And stor'd with wonders, to th'attentive mind Confirming, with persuasive eloquence Drawn from the rocky mount, or watry fen, Those sacred pages, which record the past, And awfully predict its future doom. Now, while the sun its heav'nly radiance sheds Across the vale, disclosing all its charms, Emblem of that fair Light, at whose approach The Gentile darkness fled! ye nymphs, and swains! Come haste with me, while now 'tis early morn, Thro' Upton's Upton, the seat of Robert Child, Esq. airy fields, to where yon' point Projecting hides Northampton's ancient seat Compton-Winyate, a seat of the Right Hon. the Earl of Northampton, at the foot of Edge-Hill. Retir'd, and hid amidst surrounding shades: Counting a length of honourable years, And solid worth; while painted Belvideres, Naked, aloft, and built but to be seen, Shrink at the sun, and totter to the wind. So sober Sense oft shuns the public view, In privacy conceal'd, while the pert sons Of Folly flutter in the glare of day. Hence, o'er the plain, where strip'd with alleys green, The golden harvest nods, let me your view Progressive lead to Compton-Verney, a seat of the Right Hon. Lord Willoughby de Broke. Verney's sister walls, Alike in honour, as in name allied! Alike her walls a noble master own, Studious of elegance. At his command, New pillars grace the dome with Grecian pomp Of Corinth's gay design. At his command, On hill, or plain, new culture cloaths the scene With verdant grass, or variegated grove; And bubbling rills in sweeter notes discharge Their liquid stores. Along the winding vale, At his command, observant of the shore, The glitt'ring stream, with correspondent grace, Its course pursues, and o'er th'exulting wave The stately bridge a beauteous form displays. On either side, rich as th'embroider'd floor From Persia's gaudy looms, and firm as fair, The chequer'd lawns with count'nance blithe proclaim The Graces reign. Plains, hills, and woods reply The Graces reign, and Nature smiles applause. Smile on, fair source of beauty, source of bliss! To crown the master's cost, and deck her path Who shares his joy, of gentlest manners join'd With manly sense, train'd to the love refin'd Of Nature's charms in Wroxton, the seat of the Right Hon. the Earl of Guilford, father of Lady Willoughby de Broke. Wroxton's beauteous groves. Thy neighb'ring villa's ever open gate, And festive board, O Walton, the seat of Sir Charles Mordaunt, Bart. many years a Member of Parliament for the county of Warwick. Walton! next invite The pleasing toil. Unwilling who can pay To thee the votive strain? For Science here, And Candour dwell, prepar'd alike to chear The stranger-guest, or for the nation's weal To pour the stores mature of wisdom forth, In senatorial councils often prov'd, And, by the public voice attested long, Long may it be! with well-deserv'd applause. And see, beneath the shade of full-grown elm, Or near the border of the winding brook, Skirting the grassy lawn, her polish'd train Walks forth to taste the fragrance of the grove, Woodbine, or rose, or to the upland scene Of wildly-planted hill, or trickling stream From the pure rock, or moss-lin'd grottos cool, The Naiads' humid cell! protract the way With learned converse, or ingenuous song. The search pursue to Charlecote, the seat of George Lucy, Esq. Charlecote's fair domain, Where Avon's sportive stream delighted strays Thro' the gay smiling meads, and to his bed, Hele's gentle current wooes, by Lucy's hand In ev'ry graceful ornament attir'd, And worthier, such, to share his liquid realms! Near, nor unmindful of th'increasing flood, Stratford her spacious magazines unfolds, And hails th'unwieldly barge from western shores, With foreign dainties fraught, or native ore Of pitchy hue, to pile the fewell'd grate In woolly stores, or husky grain repay'd. To speed her wealth, lo! the proud Bridge This Bridge was built in the reign of K. Henry VII. at the sole cost and charge of Sir Hugh Clopton, Knt. Lord Mayor of the City of London, and a native of this place. extends His num'rous arches, stately monument Of old munificence, and pious love Of native soil! There Stower exulting pays His tributary stream, well pleas'd with wave Auxiliary her pond'rous stores to waft; And boasting, as he flows, of growing fame, And wond'rous beauties on his banks display'd— Of Alscot's The seat of James West, Esq. swelling lawns, and fretted spires Of fairest model, Gothic, or Chinese— Of Eatington's The seat of the Hon. George Shirley, Esq., and Tolton's The seat of Sir Henry Parker, Bart. verdant meads, And groves of various leaf, and Honington The seat of Joseph Townshend, Esq., Profuse of charms, and Attic elegance; Nor fails he to relate, in jocund mood, How liberally the masters of the scene Enlarge his current, and direct his course With winding grace—and how his crystal wave Reflects th'inverted spires, and pillar'd domes— And how the frisking deer play on his sides, Pict'ring their branched heads, with wanton sport, In his clear face. Pleas'd with the vaunting tale, Nor jealous of his fame, Avon receives The prattling stream, and, towards thy nobler flood, Sabrina fair, pursues his length'ning way. Hail, beauteous Avon, hail! on whose fair banks The smiling daisies, and their sister tribes, Violets, and cuckow-buds, and lady-smocks, A brighter dye disclose, and proudly tell That Shakespeare, as he stray'd these meads along, Their simple charms admir'd, and in his verse Preserv'd, in never-fading bloom to live. And thou, whose birth these walls unrival'd boast, That mock'st the rules of the proud Stagyrite, And Learning's tedious toil, hail mighty Bard! Thou great Magician hail! Thy piercing thought Unaided saw each movement of the mind, As skilful artists view the small machine, The secret springs and nice dependencies, And to thy mimic scenes, by fancy wrought To such a wond'rous shape, th'impassion'd breast In floods of grief, or peals of laughter bow'd, Obedient to the wonder-working strain, Like the tun'd string responsive to the touch, Or to the wizard's charm, the passive storm. Humour and wit, the tragic pomp, or phrase Familiar flow'd, spontaneous from thy tongue, As flowers from Nature's lap.—Thy potent spells From their bright seats aerial sprites detain'd, Or from their unseen haunts, and slumb'ring shades Awak'd the fairy tribes, with jocund step The circled green, and leafy hall to tread: While, from his dripping caves, old Avon sent His willing Naiads to their harmless rout. Alas! how languid is the labour'd song, The slow result of rules, and tortur'd sense, Compar'd with thine! thy animated thought, And glowing phrase! which art in vain essays, And schools can never teach. Yet, though deny'd Thy pow'rs, by situation more allied, I court the genius of thy sportive Muse On Avon's bank, her sacred haunts explore, And hear in ev'ry breeze her charming notes. Beyond these flow'ry meads, with classic streams Enrich'd, two sister rills their currents join, And Ikenild displays his Roman pride. There Alcester So called from its situation on the river Alenus, or Alne, and from its being a Roman station on the Ikenild-Street. her ancient honour boasts. But fairer fame, and far more happy lot She boasts, O Ragley A seat of the Right Hon. the Earl of Hertford.! in thy courtly train Of Hertford's splendid line! Lo! from these shades, Ev'n now his sov'reign, studious of her weal, Calls him to bear his delegated rule To Britain's sister isle. Hibernia's sons Applaud the choice, and hail him to their shore With cordial gratulation. Him, well-pleas'd With more than filial rev'rence to obey, Beauchamp attends. What son, but wou'd rejoice The deeds of such a father to record! What father, but were blest in such a son! Nor may the Muse omit with Conway's The Right Hon. Henry Seymour Conway, Esq; one of his Majesty's principal Secretaries of State, and brother to the Right Hon. the Earl of Hertford. name To grace her song. O! might it worthy flow Of those her theme involves! The cyder-land, In Georgic strains, by her own Philips sung, Shou'd boast no brighter fame, though proudly grac'd With loftiest-titled names—The Cecil line, Or Beaufort's, or, O Chandois! thine, or his In Anna's councils high, her fav'rite peer, Harley! by me still honour'd in his race. See, how the pillar'd isles and stately dome Brighten the woodland-shade! while scatter'd hills, Airy, and light, in many a conic form, A theatre compose, grotesque and wild, And, with their shaggy sides, contract the vale Winding, in straiten'd circuit, round their base. Beneath their waving umbrage Flora spreads Her spotted couch, primrose, and hyacinth Profuse, with ev'ry simpler bud that blows On hill or dale. Such too thy flow'ry pride O Hewel The seat of the Right Hon. the Earl of Plymouth.! by thy master's lib'ral hand Advanc'd to rural fame! Such Umberslade The seat of the Right Hon. Lord Archer.! In the sweet labour join'd, with culture fair, And splendid arts, from Arden's The forest, or woodland part of Warwickshire. woodland shades The pois'nous damps, and savage gloom to chase. What happy lot attends your calm retreats, By no scant bound'ry, nor obstructing fence, Immur'd, or circumscrib'd; but spread at large In open day: save what to cool recess Is destin'd voluntary, not constrain'd By sad necessity, and casual state Of sickly peace! Such as the moated hall, With close circumference of watry guard, And pensile bridge proclaim! or, rear'd aloft, And inaccessible the massy tow'rs, And narrow circuit of embattled walls, Rais'd on the mountain-precipice! Such thine O Beaudesert So called, from its pleasant rural situation.! old Montfort's lofty seat! Haunt of my youthful steps! where I was wont To range, chaunting my rude notes to the wind, While Somerville disdain'd not to regard With candid ear, and regulate the strain. Such was the genius of the Gothic age, And Norman policy! Such the retreats Of Britain's ancient Nobles! less intent On rural beauty, and sweet patronage Of gentle arts, than studious to restrain, With servile awe, Barbarian multitudes; Or, with confed'rate force, the regal pow'r Controul. Hence proudly they their vassal troops Assembling, now the fate of empire plann'd: Now o'er defenceless tribes, with wanton rage, Tyrannic rul'd; and, in their castled halls Secure, with wild excess their revels kept, While many a sturdy youth, or beauteous maid, Sole solace of their parents' drooping age! Bewail'd their wretched fate, by force compell'd To these abhorr'd abodes! Hence frequent Called the Barons wars. wars, In ancient annals fam'd! Hence haply feign'd Th'enchanted castle, and its cursed train Of giants, spectres, and magicians dire! Hence gen'rous minds, with indignation fir'd, And threat'ning fierce revenge, were character'd By gallant knights on bold atchievements bent, Subduing monsters, and dissolving spells. Thus, from the rural landscape, learn to know The various characters of time and place. To hail, from open scenes, and cultur'd fields, Fair Liberty, and Freedom's gen'rous reign, With guardian laws, and polish'd arts adorn'd. While the portcullis huge, or moated fence The sad reverse of savage times betray— Distrust, barbarity, and Gothic rule. Wou'd ye, with faultless judgment, learn to plan The rural seat? To copy, as ye rove, The well-form'd picture, and correct design? First shun the false extremes of high, and low. With watry vapours this your fretted walls Will soon deface; and that, with rough assault, And frequent tempests shake your tott'ring roof. Me most the gentle eminence delights Of healthy champaign, to the sunny south Fair-op'ning, and with woods, and circling hills, Nor too remote, nor, with too close embrace, Stopping the buxom air, behind enclos'd. But if your lot hath fall'n in fields less fair, Consult their genius, and, with due regard To Nature's clear directions, shape your plan. The site too lofty shelter, and the low With sunny lawns, and open areas chear. The marish drain, and, with capacious urns, And well-conducted streams refresh the dry. So shall your lawns with healthful verdure smile, While others, sick'ning at the sultry blaze, A russet wild display, or the rank blade, And matted tufts the careless owner shame. Seek not, with fruitless cost, the level plain To raise aloft, nor sink the rising hill. Each has its charms tho' diff'rent, each in kind Improve, not alter. Art with art conceal. Let no strait terrac'd lines your slopes deform. No barb'rous walls restrain the bounded sight. But to the distant fields the closer scene Connect. The spacious lawn with scatter'd trees Irregular, in beauteous negligence, Clothe bountiful. Your unimprison'd eye, With pleasing freedom, thro' the lofty maze Shall rove, and find no dull satiety. The sportive stream with stiffen'd line avoid To torture, nor prefer the long canal, Or labour'd fount to Nature's easy flow. Your winding paths, now to the sunny Hæc amat obscurum, volet hæc sub luce videri. Hor. gleam Directed, now with high embow'ring trees, Or fragrant shrubs conceal'd, with frequent seat, And rural structure deck. Their pleasing form To fancy's eye suggests inhabitants Of more than mortal make, and their cool shade, And friendly shelter to refreshment sweet, And wholesome meditation shall invite. To ev'ry structure give its proper site. Nor, on the dreary heath, the gay alcove, Nor the lone hermit's cell, or mournful urn Build on the sprightly lawn. The grassy slope And shelter'd border for the cool arcade Or Tuscan porch reserve. To the chaste dome, And fair rotunda give the swelling mount Of freshest green. If to the Gothic scene Your taste incline, in the well-water'd vale, With lofty pines embrown'd, the mimic fane, And mould'ring abbey's fretted windows place. The craggy rock, or precipitious hill, Shall well become the castle's massy walls. In royal villas the Palladian arch, And Grecian portico, with dignity, Their pride display: ill suits their lofty rank The simpler scene. If chance historic deeds Your fields distinguish, count them doubly fair, And studious aid, with monumental stone, And faithful comment, fancy's fond review. Now other hills, with other wonders stor'd, Invite the search. In vain! unless the Muse The landscape order. Nor will she decline The pleasing task. For not to her 'tis hard To soar above the mountain's airy height, With tow'ring pinions, or, with gentler wing, T'explore the cool recesses of the vale. Her piercing eye extends beyond the reach Of optic tube, levell'd by midnight sage, At the moon's disk, or other distant sun, And planetary worlds beyond the orb Of Saturn. Nor can intervening rocks Impede her search. Alike the sylvan gloom, Or earth's profoundest caverns she pervades, And, to her fav'rite sons, makes visible All that may grace, or dignify the song, Howe'er envelop'd from their mortal ken. So Uriel, winged regent of the sun! Upon its evening-beam to Paradise Came gliding down; so, on its sloping ray, To his bright charge return'd. So th'heav'nly guest, From Adam's eyes the carnal film remov'd, On Eden's hill, and purg'd his visual nerve To see things yet unform'd, and future deeds. Lo! where the southern hill, with winding course, Bends tow'rd the west, and, from his airy seat, Views four fair provinces in union join'd; Beneath his feet, conspicuous rais'd, and rude, A massy pillar rears its shapeless head. Others in stature less, an area smooth Inclose, like that on Stone-henge. Sarum's ancient plain. And some of middle rank apart are seen: Distinguish'd those! by courtly character Of knights, while that the regal Call'd the King's-stone, or Koning-stone. title bears. What now the circle drear, and stiffen'd mass Compose, like us, were animated forms, With vital warmth, and sense, and thought endued; A band of warriors brave! Effect accurs'd Of necromantic art, and spells impure. So vulgar fame. But clerks, in antique lore Profoundly skill'd, far other story tell: And, in its mystic form, temple, or court Espy, to fabled gods, or throned kings Devote; or fabric monumental, rais'd By Saxon hands, or by that Danish chief Rollo Call'd Roll-rich-Stones.! the builder in the name imply'd. Yet to the west the pleasing search pursue, Where from the vale, Brails lifts his scarry sides, And Illmington, and Campden's hoary hills, (By Lyttelton's sweet plaint, and thy abode His matchless Lucia! to the Muse endear'd) Impress new grandeur on the spreading scene, With champaign fields, broad plain, and covert vale Diversified: By Ceres some adorn'd With rich luxuriance of golden grain, And some in Flora's liv'ry gaily dight, And some with sylvan honours graceful crown'd. Witness the forest-glades, with stately pride, Surrounding Sheldon's Weston, the seat of William Sheldon, Esq. venerable dome! Witness the sloping lawns of Idlicot The seat of the late Baron Legge, now belonging to Robert Ladbroke, Esq.! And Honington's irriguous meads! Some wind Meand'ring round the hills disjoin'd, remote, Giving full license to their sportive range; While distant, but distinct, his Alpine ridge Malvern erects o'er Esham's vale sublime, And boldly terminates the finish'd scene. Still are the praises of the Red-Horse Vale Unsung; as oft it happens to the mind Intent on distant themes, while what's more near, And nearer, more important, 'scapes its note. From yonder far-known hill, where the thin turf But ill conceals the ruddy glebe, a form On the bare soil portray'd, like that fam'd steed, Which, in its womb, the fate of Troy conceal'd, O'erlooks the vale.—Ye swains, that wish to learn, Whence rose the strange phænomenon, attend! Britannia's sons, tho' now for arts renown'd, A race of ancestors untaught, and rude, Acknowledge; like those naked Indian tribes, Which first Columbus in the Atlantic isles With wonder saw. Alike their early fate, To yield to conquering arms! Imperial Rome Was then to them what Britain is to these, And thro' the subject-land her trophies rear'd. But haughty Rome, her ancient manners flown, Stoop'd to Barbaric rage. O'er her proud walls The Goths prevail, which erst the Punic bands Assail'd in vain, tho' Cannæ's bloody field Their valour own'd, and Hannibal their guide! Such is the fate, which mightiest empires prove, Unless the virtues of the son preserve What his forefather's ruder courage won! Non his juventus orta parentibus Infecit æquor sanguine Punico, Pyrrhumque, et ingentem cecidit Antilochum, Hannibalemque dirum. Horat.No Cato now, the list'ning senate warm'd To love of virtuous deeds, and public weal. No Scipios led her hardy sons to war, With sense of glory fir'd. Thro' all her realms Or hostile arms invade, or factions shake Her tott'ring state. From her proud capitol Her tutelary gods retire, and Rome, Imperial Rome, once mistress of the world, A victim falls, so righteous Heav'n ordains, To Pride and Luxury's all-conqu'ring charms. Mean time her ancient foes, ere while restrain'd By Roman arms, from Caledonia's hills Rush like a torrent, with resistless force, O'er Britain's fenceless bounds, and thro' her fields Pour the full tide of desolating war. Ætius, thrice Consul! now an empty name, In vain her sons invoke. In vain they seek Relief in servitude. Ev'n servitude Its miserable comforts now denies, From shore to shore they fly. The briny flood, A guardian once, their further flight restrains. Some court the boist'rous deep, a milder foe, Some gain the distant shores, and fondly hope In each to find a more indulgent home. The rest, protracting still a wretched life, From Belgia's coast in wild despair invite Its new inhabitants, a Saxon race! On enterprize, and martial conquest bent. With joy the Saxons to their aid repair, And soon revenge them on their northern foes. Revenge too dearly bought! These courted guests Give them short space for joy. A hostile look On their fair fields they cast, (for feeble hands Alas! too fair,) and seize them for their own. And now again the conquer'd isle assumes Another form; on ev'ry plain, and hill New marks exhibiting of servile state, The massy stone with figures quaint inscrib'd— Or dyke by Wansdyke, or Wodensdyke, a boundary of the kingdom of the West Saxons, in Wiltshire. Woden, or the Mercian King Offa, from whom the boundary between the kingdom of the Mercians, and the Britons in Wales, took its name., Vast bound'ry made—or thine, O Ashbury Ashbury, in Berkshire, near which is the figure of a horse cut on the side of a hill, in whitish earth, which gives name to the neighbouring valley.! And Tysoe's The figure of the Red Horse, here described, is in the parish of Tysoe. wond'rous theme, the martial Horse, Carv'd on the yielding turf, armorial sign Of Hengist, Saxon Chief! of Brunswick now, And with the British lion join'd, the bird Of Rome surpassing. Studious to preserve The fav'rite form, the treach'rous conquerors Their vassal tribes compel, with festive rites, Its fading figure yearly to renew, And to the neighb'ring Call'd, from this figure, the Vale of Red-Horse. vale impart its name.

The Sun, whose eastern ray had scarcely gilt The mountain's brow, while up the steep ascent, With early step, we climb'd, now wide displays His radiant orb, and half his daily stage Hath nearly measur'd. From th'illumin'd vale The soaring mists are drain'd, and, o'er the hill, No more breathes grateful the cool, balmy air, Chearing our search, and urging on our steps Delightful. See, the languid herds forsake The burning mead, and creep beneath the shade Of spreading tree, or shelt'ring hedge-row tall: Or, in the mant'ling pool, rude reservoir Of wintry rains, and the slow, thrifty spring! Cool their parch'd limbs, and lave their panting sides. Let us too seek the shade. Yon' airy dome, Beneath whose lofty battlements we found A covert passage to these sultry realms, Invites our drooping strength, and well befriends The pleasing comment on fair Nature's book, In sumptuous volume, open'd to our view. Ye sportive nymphs! that o'er the rural scene Preside, you chief! that haunt the flow'ry banks Of Avon, where, with more majestic wave, Warwick's illustrious Lord, thro' the gay meads His dancing current guides, or round the lawn Directs th'embroider'd verge of various dyes, O! teach me all its graces to unfold, And, with your praise, join his attendant fame. 'Tis well! Here shelter'd from the scorching heat, At large we view the subject vale sublime, And unimpeded. Hence its limits trace Stretching, in wanton bound'ry, from the foot Of this green mountain, far as human ken Can reach, a theatre immense! adorn'd With ornaments of sweet variety, By Nature's pencil drawn—the level meads, A verdant floor! with brightest gems inlaid, And richly-painted flow'rs—the tillag'd plain, Wide-waving to the sun a rival blaze Of gold, best source of wealth!—the prouder hills, With outline fair, in naked pomp display'd, Round, angular, oblong; and others crown'd With graceful foliage. Over all her horn Fair Plenty pours, and Cultivation spreads Her height'ning lustre. See, beneath her touch, The smiling harvests rise, with bending line, And wavy ridge, along the dappled glebe Stretching their lengthen'd beds. Her careful hand Piles up the yellow grain, or rustling hay Adust for wintry store—the long-ridg'd mow, Or shapely pyramid, with conic roof, Dressing the landscape. She the thick-wove fence Nurses, and adds, with care, the hedge-row elm. Around her farms and villages she plans The rural garden, yielding wholesome food Of simple viands, and the fragrant herb Medicinal. The well-rang'd orchard now She orders, or the shelt'ring clump, or tuft Of hardy trees, the wintry storms to curb, Or guard the sweet retreat of village-swain, With health, and plenty crown'd. Fair Science next, Her offspring! adds towns, cities, vaulted domes, And splendid palaces, and chases large, With lake, and planted grove. Hence Warwick, fair With rising buildings, Coventry's tall spires, And Kenelworth! thy stately castle rose, Which still, in ruin, charms th'astonish'd sight. To crown the beauteous scene, the curtain'd sky, Its canopy divine of azure tint, Spreads heav'nly fair, and softens ev'ry charm. Now yet again, with accurate survey, The level plain, hills rising various, woods, And meadows green, the simple cot, and towns, Nurs'ries of arts, and commerce! Warwick, fair With rising buildings, Coventry's tall spires, Magnificent in ruin Kenelworth! And still more distant scenes, with legends strange, And smoaky arts, taught in the dusky schools Of Tubal's sons, attentive let us scan, And all their charms, and mysteries explore. First view, but cautious, the vast precipice; Lest, startled at the giddy height, thy sense Swimming forsake thee, and thy trembling limbs, Unnerv'd, and fault'ring, threaten dang'rous lapse. Along th'indented bank, the forest-tribes, The thin-leav'd ash, dark oak, and glossy beech, Of polish'd rind, their branching boughs extend, With blended tints, and amicable strife, Forming a checker'd shade. Below, the lawns, With spacious sweep, and wild declivity, To yellow plains their sloping verdure join. There, white with flocks, and, in her num'rous herds Exulting, Chadsunt's The seat of James Newsam Craggs, Esq. pastures, large, and fair Salute the sight, and witness to the fame Of Lichfield's mitred saint St. Chadd.. The furzy heaths Succeed; close refuge of the tim'rous Hare, Or prowling Fox, but refuge insecure! From their dark covert oft the hunter-train Rouse them unwilling, and, o'er hill, and dale, With wild, tumultuous joy, their steps pursue. Just vengeance on the midnight thief! and life With life aton'd! But that poor, trembling wretch! ‘Who doubts if now she lives,’ what hath she done Guiltless of blood, and impotent of wrong? How num'rous, how insatiate yet her foes! Ev'n in these thickets, where she vainly sought A safe retreat from man's unfeeling race, The busy hound, to blood, and slaughter train'd, Snuffs her sweet vapour, and, to murth'rous rage, By mad'ning sounds impell'd, in her close seat, With fury tears her, and her corse devours: Or scares her o'er the fields, and, by the scent, With keen desire of reeking gore inflam'd, Loud-bellowing tortures her with deathful cries. Nor more secure her path! Man even there, Watching, with foul intent, her secret haunts, Plants instruments of death, and round her neck The fatal snare entwines. Thus Innocence, In human things, by wily Fraud ensnar'd, Oft helpless falls, while the bold Plund'rer 'scapes. Next the wide champaign, and the cheerful downs Claim notice; chiefly thine, O Chesterton A seat of the Right Honourable Lord Willoughby de Broke, so called from its being a Roman station on the Foss-Way.! Pre-eminent. Nor 'scape the roving eye Thy solemn wood, and Roman vestiges, Encampment green, or military road! Amusive to the grave, historic mind. Thee A seat of Sir Walter Bagot, Bart. Tachbroke joins with venerable shade. Nor distant far, in Saxon annals fam'd, The rural Offchurch, the seat of Whitwick Knightley, Esq. court of Offa, Mercian King! Where, sever'd from its trunk, low lies the head Of brave Fermundus, slain by coward hands, As on the turf supine in sleep he lay, Nor wist it sleep from which to wake no more! Now Warwick claims the song; supremely fair In this fair realm; conspicuous rais'd to view On the firm rock, a beauteous eminence For health, and pleasure form'd. Full to the south A stately range of high, embattled walls And lofty tow'rs, and precipices vast, The Castle.Its guardian worth, and ancient pomp confess. The Priory, now the seat of Henry Wise, Esq.The northern hills, where Superstition long Her gloomy rites maintain'd, a tranquil scene Of gentler arts, and pleasures more refin'd Displays. Lawns, parks, and meadows fair, And groves around their mingled graces join, And Avon pours his tributary stream. Called Caer-Leon from Guth-Leon, also Caer-Gwayr, or Guaric, from Gwar, two British Kings. Its present name is said to be taken from Warremund, a Saxon.On thee contending kings their bounty pour'd, And call'd the favour'd city by their names. It was the Præsidium of the Romans.Thy worth the Romans publish'd, when to thee Their legions they consign'd. Thee Ethelflede She rebuilt it when it had been destroyed by the Danes., Thy guardian Fair! with royal grace restor'd, When Pagan foes had raz'd thy goodly streets. A monarch's care, those walls The Free-School. to learning rais'd, The Hospital.These an asylum to declining age A Leicester's love proclaim. Nor pass unsung The train of gallant chiefs, by thy lov'd name Distinguish'd, and by deeds of high renown Gracing the lofty title. The first Earl of Warwick, and one of the Knights of King Arthur's round table. Arthgal first, And brave Morvidus, fam'd in Druid song, And British annals. Fair Felicia's sire, Rohand! and with her join'd in wedded love, Immortal Guy! who near Wintonia's walls With that gigantic braggard Colebrand hight! For a long summer's day sole fight maintain'd. But huge gigantic size, and braggart oaths, And sword, or massy club dismay'd thee not. Thy skill the stroke eluded, or thy shield Harmless receiv'd, while on his batter'd sides Fell thick thy galling blows, till from his hands Down dropp'd the pond'rous weapon, and himself Prostrate, to thy keen blade his grizly head Reluctant yielded. Lamentations loud, And shouts victorious, in strange concert join'd, Proclaim the champion's fall. Thee Athelstan His great deliverer owns, and meditates With honours fair, and festive pomp to crown. But other meed thy thoughtful mind employ'd, Intent in heav'nly solitude to spend The precious eve of life. Yet shall the Muse Thy deed record, and on her patriot list Enrol thy name, tho' many a Saxon chief She leaves unsung. A Norman race succeeds, To thee, fair town Henry de Novo Burgo, the first Norman Earl, founded the priory at Warwick, and Roger his son built and endowed the church of St. Mary.! by charitable deeds, And pious gifts endear'd. The Beauchamps too Thou claim'st, for arms, and courtly manners fam'd! Richard Earl of Warwick, in the reigns of K. Henry IV. V. and VI. was Governor of Calais, and Lieutenant General of France. He founded the Lady's Chapel, and lies interred there under a very magnificent monument.Him chief, whom three imperial Henrys crown'd With envied honours. Mirror fair was he Of valour, and of knightly feats atchiev'd In tilt, and tournament. Thee Called Make-King. He was killed at the battle of Barnet. Nevil boasts For bold exploits renown'd, with civil strife When Britain's bleeding realm her weakness mourn'd, And half her nobles in the contest slain Of York, and Lancaster. He, sworn to both, As int'rest tempted, or resentment fir'd, To Henry now, and now to Edward join'd His pow'rful aid; now both to empire rais'd, Now from their summit pluck'd, till in the strife By Edward's conquering arms at length he fell. Thou, He married the Earl of Warwick's daughter, and was put to death by his brother, Edward IV. Clarence, next, and next thy hapless son, The last Beheaded in the Tower by Henry VII. under a pretence of favouring the escape of Peter Warbeck. Plantagenet awhile appears To dignify the list; both sacrific'd To barb'rous policy! Proud Made Earl of Warwick by Edward VI. and afterwards Duke of Northumberland. Dudley now From Edward's hand the bright distinction bore, But soon to Mary paid his forfeit head, And in his fate a wretched race involv'd: Thee chief, thee wept by ev'ry gentle Muse, Fair Lady Jane Grey, married to a son of the Earl of Warwick. Jane! untimely doom'd to bloody death, For treason not thy own. To Robert Lord Rich, created Earl of Warwick by James I.

Late may it there remain! With promise fair, as now, (more fair what heart Parental craves?) of long, transmissive worth, Proud Warwick's name, with growing fame to grace, And crown, with lasting joy, her castled hill. Hail, stately pile; fit mansion for the great! Worthy the lofty title! Worthy him Sir Fulke Greville, made Baron Brook of Beaucamp's-court, by James I. had the Castle of Warwick, then in a ruinous condition, granted to him; upon which he laid out 20,000 l. He lies buried in a neat octagon building, on the north side of the chancel at Warwick, under a fine marble monument, on which is the following very significant, laconic inscription, “TROPHOEVM PECCATI! Fulke Greville, Servant to Queen Elizabeth, Counsellor to King James, and Friend to Sir Philip Sidney.”, To Beauchamp's gallant race allied! the friend Of gentle Sidney! to whose long desert, In royal councils prov'd, his sov'reign's gift Consign'd the lofty structure: Worthy he! The lofty structure's splendor to restore. Nor less intent who now, by lineal right, His place sustains, with reparations bold, And well-attemper'd dignity to grace Th'embattled walls. Nor spares his gen'rous mind The cost of rural work, plantation large, Forest, or fragrant shrub; or shelter'd walks, Or ample, verdant lawns, where the sleek deer Sport on the brink of Avon's flood, or graze Beneath the rising walls; magnificence With grace uniting, and enlarg'd delight Of prospect fair, and Nature's smiling scenes! Still is the colouring faint. O! cou'd my verse, Like their The Right Hon. Lady Louisa Greville, daughter to the Right Hon. the Earl of Warwick. Louisa's pencil'd shades describe The tow'rs, the woods, the lawns, the winding stream, Fair like her form, and like her birth sublime! Not Windsor's royal scenes by Denham sung, Or that more tuneful bard on Twick'nam's shore Should boast a loftier strain, but in my verse Their fame shou'd live, as lives, proportion'd true, Their beauteous image in her graven lines. Transporting theme! on which I still cou'd waste The ling'ring hours, and still protract the song With new delight; but thy example, Guy! Calls me from scenes of pomp, and earthly pride, To muse with thee in thy sequester'd cell Called Guy's Cliff, the seat of the Right Hon. Lady Mary Greatheed.. Here the calm scene lulls the tumultuous breast To sweet composure. Here the gliding stream, That winds its watry path in many a maze, As loth to leave th'enchanted spot, invites To moralize on fleeting time, and life, With all its treach'rous sweets, and fading joys, In emblem shewn, by many a short-liv'd flow'r, That on its margin smiles, and smiling falls To join its parent Earth. Here let me delve, Near thine, my chamber in the peaceful rock, And think no more of gilded palaces, And luxury of sense. From the till'd glebe, Or ever-teeming brook, my frugal meal I'll gain, and slake my thirst at yonder spring. Like thee, I'll climb the steep, and mark the scene How fair! how passing fair! in grateful strains Singing the praises of creative love. Like thee, I'll tend the call of mattin bell Here was anciently an oratory, where tradition says, Guy spent the latter part of his life in devotional exercises. To early orisons, and latest tune My evening song to that more wond'rous love, Which sav'd us from the grand Apostate's wiles, And righteous vengeance of Almighty ire, Justly incens'd. O pow'r of grace divine! When mercy met with truth, with justice, peace. Thou, holy Hermit! in this league secure, Did'st wait Death's vanquish'd spectre as a friend, To change thy mortal coil for heav'nly bliss. Next, Kenelworth! thy fame invites the song. Assemblage sweet of social, and serene! But chiefly two fair streets, in adverse rows, Their lengthen'd fronts extend, reflecting each Beauty on each reciprocal. Between, A verdant valley, slop'd from either side, Forms the mid-space, where gently-gliding flows A crystal stream, beneath the mould'ring base Of an old abbey's venerable walls. Still further in the vale her castle lifts Its stately tow'rs, and tott'ring battlements, Drest with the rampant ivy's uncheck'd growth Luxuriant. Here let us pause awhile, To read the melancholy tale of pomp Laid low in dust, and, from historic page, Compose its epitaph. Hail, Geoffry de Clinton, who built both the Castle, and the adjoining Monastery, Temp. Hen. I. Clinton! hail! Thy Norman founder still yon' neighb'ring Clinton-Green. Green, And massy walls, with stile Cæsar's-Tower. Imperial grac'd, Record. The The Montforts, Earls of Leicester, of which Simon de Montfort, and his son Henry, were killed at the battle of Evesham. Montforts thee with hardy deeds, And memorable siege by Henry III. who besieged this Castle, and call'd a convention here, which passed an act for redeeming forfeited estates, called Dictum de Kenelworth. Henry's arms, And senatorial acts, that bear thy name Distinguish. Thee the bold Lancastrian From whom a part of this structure is called Lancaster's Buildings. line, A royal train! from valiant Gaunt deriv'd, Grace with new lustre; till Eliza's hand Transferr'd thy walls to Leicester's Granted by Queen Elizabeth to Dudley Earl of Leicester. favour'd Earl. He long, beneath thy roof, the maiden Queen, And all her courtly guests, with rare device Of mask, and emblematic scenery, Tritons, and sea-nymphs, and the floating isle, Detain'd. Nor feats of prowess, joust, or tilt Of harness'd knights, nor rustic revelry Were wanting; nor the dance, and sprightly mirth Beneath the festive walls, with regal state, And choicest lux'ry serv'd. But regal state, And sprightly mirth, beneath the festive roof, Are now no more. No more assembled crowds At the stern porter's lodge admittance crave. No more, with plaint, or suit importunate, The thronged lobby echoes, nor with staff, Or gaudy badge, the busy pursuivants Lead to wish'd audience. All, alas! is gone, And Silence keeps her melancholy court Throughout the walls; save, where, in rooms of state, Kings once repos'd! chatter the wrangling daws, Or screech-owls hoot along the vaulted isles. No more the trumpet calls the martial band, With sprightly summons, to the guarded lists; Nor lofty galleries their pride disclose Of beauteous nymphs in courtly pomp attir'd, Watching, with trembling hearts, the doubtful strife, And, with their looks, inspiring wond'rous deeds. No more the lake displays its pageant shows, And emblematic forms. Alike the lake, And all its emblematic forms are flown, And in their place mute flocks, and heifers graze, Or buxom damsels ted the new-mown hay. What art thou, Grandeur! with thy flatt'ring train Of pompous lies, and boastful promises? Where are they now, and what's their mighty sum? All, all are vanish'd! like the fleeting forms Drawn in an evening cloud. Nought now remains, Save these sad relicks of departed pomp, These spoils of time, a monumental pile! Which to the vain its mournful tale relates, And warns them not to trust to fleeting dreams. Thee too, tho' boasting not a royal train, The Muse, O Formerly a seat of the Knights Templars, now an Almshouse for poor widows, founded by the Lady Katharine Levison, a descendant of Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester. Balshal! in her faithful page Shall celebrate: for long beneath thy roof A band of warriors bold, of high renown, To martial deeds, and hazardous emprize Sworn, for defence of Salem's sacred walls, From Paynim-foes, and holy pilgrimage. Now other guests thou entertain'st, A female band, by female charity Sustain'd. Thee, The seat of Christopher Wren, Esq; once a nunnery, dedicated to St. Leonard.—See Dugdale's Antiquities. Wroxal! too, in fame allied, Seat of the Poet's, and the Muse's friend! My verse shall sing, with thy long-exil'd Knight, By Leonard's pray'rs, from distant servitude, To these brown thickets, and his mournful mate, Invisibly convey'd. Yet doubted she His speech, and alter'd form, and better proof Impatient urg'd. (So Ithaca's chaste queen Her much-wish'd lord, by twice ten absent years, And wise Minerva's guardian care disguis'd, Acknowledg'd not: so, with suspended faith, His bridal claim repress'd.) Strait he displays Part of the nuptial ring between them shar'd, When in the bold crusade his shield he bore. The twin memorial of their plighted love Within her faithful bosom she retain'd. Quick from its shrine the hallow'd pledge she drew, To match it with its mate, when, strange to tell! No sooner had the separated curves Approach'd each other, but, with sudden spring, They join'd again, and the small circle clos'd. So they, long sever'd, met in close embrace. At length, O Coventry! thy neighb'ring fields, And fair surrounding villas we attend, The seat of M. Neale, Esq. Allesley, and The seat of Ed. Bowater, Esq; now belonging to Francis Wheeler, Esq. Whitley's pastures, The seat of Arthur Gregory, Esq; commanding a pleasant view of Coventry park, &amp;c. Stivichale, That views with lasting joy thy green domains, And The seat of William Bromley, Esq; one of the Representatives in Parliament for the county of Warwick. Bagington's fair walls, and The seat of the Right Hon. Lord Leigh. Stonely! thine, And The seat of the Right Hon. Lord Craven. Coombe's majestic pile, both boasting once Monastic pomp, still equal in renown! And, as their kindred fortunes they compare, Applauding more the present, than the past. Ev'n now the pencil'd sheets, unroll'd, display More sprightly charms of beauteous lawn, and grove, And sweetly-wand'ring paths, and ambient stream, To chear with lasting flow th'enamell'd scene, And themes of song for future bards prepare. Fair City! thus environ'd! and thyself For royal grants, and silken arts renown'd! To thee the docile youth repair, and learn, With sidelong glance, and nimble stroke, to ply The flitting shuttle, while their active feet, In mystic movements, press the subtle stops Of the loom's complicated frame, contriv'd, From the loose thread, to form, with wond'rous art, A texture close, inwrought with choice device Of flow'r, or foliage gay, to the rich stuff, Or silky web, imparting fairer worth. Nor shall the Muse, in her descriptive song, Neglect from dark oblivion to preserve Thy mould'ring Built by Sir William Hollies, Lord Mayor of London, in the reign of King Henry VIII. Cross, with ornament profuse Of pinnacles, and niches, proudly rais'd, Height above height, a sculptur'd chronicle! Less lasting than the monumental verse. Nor scornful will she flout thy cavalcade, Made yearly to Godiva's deathless praise, While gaping crowds around her pageant throng, With prying look, and stupid wonderment. Not so the Muse! who, with her virtue fir'd, And love of thy renown, in notes as chaste As her fair purpose, from memorials dark, Shall, to the list'ning ear, her tale explain. When Edward the Confessor. Edward, last of Egbert's royal race, O'er sev'n united realms the sceptre sway'd, Proud Leofric, with trust of sov'reign pow'r, The subject Mercians rul'd. His lofty state The loveliest of her sex! a noble dame Of Thorold's ancient line, Godiva shar'd. But pageant pomp charm'd not her saintly mind Like virtuous deeds, and care of others weal. Such tender passions in his haughty breast He cherish'd not, but with despotic sway, Controul'd his vassal tribes, and, from their toil, His luxury maintain'd. Godiva saw Their plaintive looks; with grief she saw thy sons, O Coventry! by tyrant laws oppress'd, And urg'd her haughty lord, but urg'd in vain! With patriot-rule, thy drooping arts to chear. Yet, tho' forbidden e'er again to move In what so much his lofty state concern'd, Not so from thought of charitable deed Desisted she, but amiably perverse Her hopeless suit renew'd. Bold was th'attempt! Yet not more bold than fair, if pitying sighs Be fair, and charity which knows no bounds. What had'st thou then to fear from wrath inflam'd At such transcendent guilt, rebellion join'd With female weakness, and officious zeal? So thy stern lord might call the gen'rous deed; Perhaps might punish as befitted deed So call'd, if love restrain'd not: yet tho' love O'er anger triumph'd, and imperious rule, Not o'er his pride; which better to maintain, His answer thus he artfully return'd. Why will the lovely partner of my joys, Forbidden, thus her wild petition urge? Think not my breast is steel'd against the claims Of sweet humanity. Think not I hear Regardless thy request. If piety, Or other motive, with mistaken zeal, Call'd to thy aid, pierc'd not my stubborn frame, Yet to the pleader's worth, and modest charms, Wou'd my fond love no trivial gift impart. But pomp and fame forbid. That vassalage, Which, thoughtless, thou wou'dst tempt me to dissolve, Exalts our splendor, and augments my pow'r. With tender bosoms form'd, and yielding hearts, Your sex soon melts at sights of vulgar woe; Heedless how glory fires the manly breast With love of rank sublime. This principle In female minds a feebler empire holds, Opposing less the specious arguments For milder rule, and freedom's popular theme. But plant some gentler passion in its room, Some virtuous instinct suited to your make, As glory is to ours, alike requir'd A ransom for the vulgar's vassal state, Then wou'dst thou soon the strong contention own, And justify my conduct. Thou art fair, And chaste as fair; with nicest sense of shame, And sanctity of thought. Thy bosom thou Did'st ne'er expose to shameless dalliance Of wanton eyes; nor, ill-concealing it Beneath the treach'rous cov'ring, tempt aside The secret glance, with meditated fraud. Go now, and lay thy modest garments by: In naked beauty, mount thy milk-white steed, And through the streets, in face of open day, And gazing slaves, their fair deliv'rer ride: Then will I own thy pity was sincere, Applaud thy virtue, and confirm thy suit. But if thou lik'st not such ungentle terms, And sure thy soul the guilty thought abhors! Know then that Leofric, like thee, can feel, Like thee, may pity, while he seems severe, And urge thy suit no more. His speech he clos'd, And, with strange oaths, confirm'd the sad decree. Again, within Godiva's gentle breast New tumults rose. At length her female fears Gave way, and sweet humanity prevail'd. Reluctant, but resolv'd, the matchless fair Gives all her naked beauty to the sun: Then mounts her milk-white steed, and, thro' the streets, Rides fearless; her dishevell'd hair a veil! That o'er her beauteous limbs luxuriant flow'd, Nurs'd long by Fate for this important day! Prostrate to earth th'astonish'd vassals bow, Or to their inmost privacies retire. All, but one prying slave! who fondly hop'd, With venial curiosity, to gaze On such a wond'rous dame. But soul disgrace O'ertook the bold offender, and he stands, By just decree, a spectacle abhorr'd, And lasting monument of swift revenge For thoughts impure, and beauty's injur'd charms. Ye guardians of her rights, so nobly won! Cherish the Muse, who first in modern strains Essay'd to sing your lovely See Dugdale's Antiquities of Warwickshire. It is pleasant enough to observe, with what gravity the above-mentioned learned writer dwells on the praises of this renown'd lady. “And now, before I proceed,” says he, “I have a word more to say of the noble Countess Godeva, which is, that besides her devout advancement of that pious work of his, i. e. her husband Leofric, in this magnificent monastery, viz. of Monks at Coventry, she gave her whole treasure thereto, and sent for skilful goldsmiths, who, with all the gold and silver she had, made crosses, images of saints, and other curious ornaments.” Which passages may serve as a specimen of the devotion and patriotism of those times. Patriot's fame, Anxious to rescue from oblivious time Such matchless virtue, her heroic deed Illustrate, and your gay procession grace. END OF BOOK THE SECOND. BOOK III. AFTERNOON.

Process of it. Panegyric upon Iron. Again, the Muse her airy flight essays. Will Villers, skill'd alike in classic song, Or, with a critic's eye, to trace the charms Of Nature's beauteous scenes, attend the lay? Will he, accustom'd to soft Latian climes, As to their softer numbers, deign awhile To quit the Mantuan Bard's harmonious strain, By sweet attraction of the theme allur'd? The Latian Poet's song is still the same. Not so the Latian fields. The gentle Arts That made those fields so fair, when Gothic Rule, And Superstition, with her bigot train, Fixt there their gloomy seat, to this fair Isle Retir'd, with Freedom's gen'rous sons to dwell, To grace her cities, and her smiling plains With plenty cloathe, and crown the rural toil. Nor hath he found, throughout those spacious realms Where Albis flows, and Ister's stately flood, More verdant meads, or more superb remains Of old magnificence, than his own fields Display, where The magnificent ruins of Kenilworth Castle, built by Geofry de Clinton, and more particularly described in the preceding book, belong to the Right Hon. the Earl of Clarendon, many years resident in Italy, and Envoy to most of the Courts in Germany. Clinton's venerable walls In ruin, still their ancient grandeur tell. Requires there aught of learning's pompous aid To prove that all this outward frame of things Is what it seems, not unsubstantial air, Ideal vision, or a waking dream, Without existence, save what Fancy gives? Shall we, because we strive in vain to tell How Matter acts on incorporeal Mind, Or how, when sleep has lock'd up ev'ry sense, Or fevers rage, Imagination paints Unreal scenes, reject what sober sense, And calmest thought attest? Shall we confound States wholly diff'rent? Sleep with wakeful life? Disease with health? This were to quit the day, And seek our path at midnight. To renounce Man's surest evidence, and idolize Imagination. Hence then banish we These metaphysic subtleties, and mark The curious structure of these visual orbs, The windows of the mind; substance how clear, Aqueous, or crystalline! through which the soul, As thro' a glass, all outward things surveys. See, while the sun gilds, with his golden beam, Yon' distant pile, which Hyde, with care refin'd, From plunder guards, its form how beautiful! Anon some cloud his radiance intercepts, And all the splendid object fades away. Or, if some incrustation o'er the sight Its baleful texture spread, like a clear lens, With filth obscur'd! no more the sensory, Thro' the thick film, imbibes the chearful day, ‘But cloud instead, and ever-during night Surround it.’ So, when on some weighty truth A beam of heav'nly light its lustre sheds, To Reason's eye it looks supremely fair. But if foul Passion, or distemper'd Pride, Impede its search, or Phrenzy seize the brain, Then Ignorance a gloomy darkness spreads, Or Superstition, with mishapen forms, Erects its savage empire in the mind. The vulgar race of men, like herds that graze, On Instinct live, not knowing how they live; While Reason sleeps, or waking stoops to Sense. But sage Philosophy explores the cause Of each phænomenon of sight, or sound, Taste, touch, or smell; each organ's inmost frame, And correspondence with external things: Explains how diff'rent texture of their parts Excites sensations diff'rent, rough, or smooth, Bitter, or sweet, fragrance, or noisome scent: How various streams of undulating air, Thro' the ear's winding labyrinth convey'd, Cause all the vast variety of sounds. Hence too the subtle properties of light, And sev'n-fold colour are distinctly view'd In the prismatic glass, and outward forms Shewn fairly drawn, in miniature divine, On the transparent eye's membraneous cell. By combination hence of diff'rent orbs, Convex, or concave, thro' their crystal pores, Transmitting variously the solar ray, With line oblique, the telescopic tube Reveals the wonders of the starry sphere, Worlds above worlds; or, in a single grain, Or watry drop, the penetrative eye Discerns innumerable inhabitants Of perfect structure, imperceptible To naked view. Hence each defect of sense Obtains relief; hence to the palsy'd ear New impulse, vision new to languid sight, Surprize to both, and youthful joys restor'd! Cheap is the bliss we never knew to want! So graceless spendthrifts waste unthankfully Those sums, which Merit often seeks in vain, And Poverty wou'd kneel to call its own. So objects, hourly seen, unheeded pass, At which the new-created sight would gaze With exquisite delight. Doubt ye this truth? A tale shall place it fairer to your view. A youth For the general subject of the following story, see the Tatler, Numb. 55, and Smith's Optics. there was, a youth of lib'ral mind, And fair proportion in each lineament Of outward form; but dim suffusion veil'd His sightless orbs, which roll'd, and roll'd in vain To find the blaze of day. From infancy, Till full maturity glow'd on his cheek, The long, long night its gloomy empire held, And mock'd each gentle effort, lotions, Or cataplasms, by parental hands, With fruitless care employ'd. At length a Leech, Of skill profound, well-vers'd in optic lore, An arduous task devis'd aside to draw The veil, which, like a cloud, hung o'er his sight, And ope a lucid passage to the sun. Instant the Youth the promis'd blessing craves. But first his parents, with uplifted hands, The healing Pow'rs invoke, and pitying friends With sympathizing heart, the rites prepare: 'Mongst these, who well deserv'd the important trust, A gentle Maid there was, that long had wail'd His hapless fate. Full many a tedious hour Had she, with converse, and instructive song, Beguil'd. Full many a step darkling her arm Sustain'd him; and, as they their youthful days In friendly deeds, and mutual intercourse Of sweet endearment pass'd, love in each breast His empire fix'd; in her's with pity join'd, In his with gratitude, and deep regard. The friendly wound was giv'n; th'obstructing film Drawn artfully aside; and, on his sight Burst the full tide of day. Surpriz'd he stood, Not knowing where he was, nor what he saw! The skilful artist first, as first in place He view'd, then seiz'd his hand, then felt his own, Then mark'd their near resemblance, much perplex'd, And still the more perplex'd, the more he saw. Now silence first th'impatient mother broke, And, as her eager looks on him she bent, “My son,” she cried, “my son!” On her he gaz'd With fresh surprize. And, what? he cried, art thou My mother? for thy voice bespeaks thee such, Tho' to my sight unknown. Thy mother I! She quick reply'd, thy sister, brother these— O! 'tis too much, he said; too soon to part, Ere well we meet! But this new flood of day O'erpow'rs me, and I feel a death-like damp Chill all my frame, and stop my fault'ring tongue. Now Lydia, so they call'd his gentle friend, Who, with averted eye, but, in her soul, Had felt the lancing steel, her aid apply'd, And stay, dear youth, she said, or with thee take Thy Lydia, thine alike in life, or death. At Lydia's name, at Lydia's well-known voice, He strove again to raise his drooping head, And ope his closing eye, but strove in vain, And on her trembling bosom sunk away. Now other fears distract his weeping friends. But short this grief! for soon his life return'd, And, with return of life, return'd their peace. Yet, for his safety, they resolve awhile His infant sense from day's bright beams to guard, Ere yet again they tempt such dang'rous joy. As, when from some transporting dream awak'd, We fondly on the sweet delusion dwell, And, with intense reflection, to our minds Picture th'enchanted scene—angelic forms— Converse sublime—and more than waking bliss! Till the coy vision, as the more we strive To paint it livelier on th'enraptur'd sense, Still fainter grows, and dies at last away: So dwelt the Youth on his late transient joy, So long'd the dear remembrance to renew. At length, again the wish'd-for day arriv'd. The task was Lydia's! her's the charge, alone From dangers new to guard the dear delight; But first th'impatient Youth she thus address'd. Dear Youth! my trembling hands but ill essay This tender task, and with unusual fear, My flutt'ring heart forebodes some danger nigh. Dismiss thy fears, he cried, nor think so ill I con thy lessons, as still need be taught To hail, with caution, the new-coming day. Then loose these envious folds, and teach my sight, If more can be, to make thee more belov'd. Ah! there's my grief, she cried: 'tis true our hearts With mutual passion burn, but then 'tis true Thou ne'er hast known me by that subtle sense Thro' which love most an easy passage finds; That sense! which soon may shew thee many a maid Fairer than Lydia, tho' more faithful none. And may she not cease then to be belov'd? May she not then, when less thou need'st her care, Give place to some new charmer? 'Tis for this I sigh; for this my sad foreboding fears New terrors form. And can'st thou then, he cried, Want aught that might endear thee to my soul? Art thou not excellence? Art thou not all That man cou'd wish? Goodness, and gentlest love? Can I forget thy long assiduous care? Thy morning-tendance, surest mark to me Of day's return, of night thy late adieu? Do I need aught to make my bliss compleat, When thou art by me? when I press thy hand? When I breath fragrance at thy near approach; And hear the sweetest music in thy voice? Can that, which to each other sense is dear, So wond'rous dear, be otherwise to sight? Or can sight make, what is to reason good, And lovely, seem less lovely, and less good? Perish the sense, that wou'd make Lydia such! Perish its joys, those joys however great! If to be purchas'd with the loss of thee. O my dear Lydia! if there be indeed The danger thou report'st, O! by our love, Our mutual love, I charge thee, ne'er unbind These hapless orbs, or tear them from their seat, Ere they betray me thus to worse than death. No, Heav'n forbid! she cried, for Heav'n hath heard Thy parents pray'rs, and many a friend now waits To mingle looks of cordial love with thine. And shou'd I rob them of the sacred bliss? Shou'd I deprive thee of the rapt'rous sight? No! be thou happy; happy be thy friends; Whatever fate attends thy Lydia's love; Thy hapless Lydia!—Hapless did I say? Ah! wherefore? wherefore wrong I thus thy worth? Why doubt thy well-known truth, and constant mind? No, happiest she of all the happy train, In mutual vows, and plighted faith secure! So saying, she the silken bandage loos'd, Nor added further speech, prepar'd to watch The new surprize, and guide the doubtful scene, By silence more than tenfold night conceal'd. When thus the Youth. And is this then the world, In which I am to live? Am I awake? Or do I dream? Or hath some pow'r unknown, Far from my friends, far from my native home; Convey'd me to these radiant seats? O thou! Inhabitant of this enlighten'd world! Whose heav'nly softness far transcends his shape, By whom this miracle was first atchiev'd, O! deign thou to instruct me where I am; And how to name thee by true character, Angel, or mortal! Once I had a friend, Who, but till now, ne'er left me in distress. Her speech was harmony, at which my heart With transport flutter'd; and her gracious hand Supplied me with whate'er my wish cou'd form; Supply, and transport ne'er so wish'd before! Never, when wanted, yet, so long denied! Why is she silent now, when most I long To hear her heav'nly voice? why flies she not With more than usual speed to crown my bliss? Ah! did I leave her in that darksome world? Or rather dwells she not in these bright realms, Companion fit for such fair forms as thine? O! teach me, if thou canst, how I may find This gentle counsellor; when found, how know By this new sense, which, better still to rate Her worth, I chiefly wish'd. The lovely form Replied, In me behold that gentle friend, If still thou own'st me such. O! yes, 'tis she, He cried; 'tis Lydia! 'tis her charming voice! O! speak again; O! let me press thy hand: On these I can rely. This new-born sense May cheat me. Yet so much I prize thy form, I willingly would think it tells me true— Ha! what are these? Are they not they, of whom Thou warn'dst me? Yes—true—they are beautiful. But have they lov'd like thee, like thee convers'd? They move not as we move, they bear no part In my new bliss. And yet methinks, in one, Her form I can descry, tho' now so calm! Who call'd me son. Mistaken Youth! she cried, These are not what they seem; are not as we, Not living substances, but pictur'd shapes, Resemblances of life! by mixture form'd Of light, and shade, in sweet proportion join'd. But hark! I hear, without, thy longing friends, Who wait my summons, and reprove my stay. To thy direction, cried th'enraptur'd Youth, To thy direction I commit my steps. Lead on, be thou my guide, as late, so now, In this new world, and teach me how to use This wond'rous faculty; which thus, so soon Mocks me with phantoms. Yet enough for me! That all my past experience joins with this To tell me I am happier than I know. To tell me thou art Lydia! From whose side I never more will part! with whom compar'd, All others of her sex, however fair, Shall be like painted, unsubstantial forms. So when the soul, inflam'd with strong desire Of purer bliss, its earthly mansion leaves, Perhaps some friendly genius, wont to steer With ministerial charge, his dang'rous steps; Perhaps some gentle partner of his toil, More early blest, in radiant lustre clad, And form celestial, meets his dazzled sight; And guides his way, thro' trackless fields of air, To join, with rapt'rous joy, th'ethereal train. Now to the midland search the Muse returns. For more, and still more busy scenes remain; The promis'd schools of wise artificers In brass, and iron. But another school Of gentler arts demands the Muse's song, Where first she learn'd to scan the measur'd verse, And aukwardly her infant notes essay'd. Hail Solihul! respectful I salute Thy walls; more awful once! when, from the sweets Of festive freedom, and domestic ease, With throbbing heart, to the stern discipline Of pædagogue morose I sad return'd. But tho' no more his brow severe, nor dread Of birchen sceptre awes my riper age, A sterner tyrant rises to my view, With deadlier weapon arm'd. Ah! Critic! spare, O! spare the Muse, who feels her youthful fears On thee transfer'd, and trembles at thy lash. Against the venal tribe, that prostitutes The tuneful art, to sooth the villain's breast, To blazon fools, or feed the pamper'd lust Of bloated vanity; against the tribe Which casts its wanton jests at holy truths, Or clothes, with virtue's garb, th'accursed train Of loathsome vices, lift thy vengeful arm, And all thy just severity exert. Enough to venial faults, and hapless want Of animated numbers, such as breathe The soul of epic song, hath erst been paid Within these walls, still stain'd with infant blood. Yet may I not forget the pious care Of love parental, anxious to improve My youthful mind. Nor yet the debt disown Due to severe restraint, and rigid laws, The wholesome curb of Passion's headstrong reign. To them I owe that ere, with painful toil, Thro' Priscian's crabbed rules, laborious task! I held my course, till the dull, tiresome road Plac'd me on classic ground, that well repaid The labours of the way. To them I owe The pleasing knowledge of my youthful mates Matur'd in age, and honours. These among, I gratulate whom Augusta's senate hails Father! and, in each charge, and high employ, Found worthy all her love, with amplest trust, And dignity invests. And well I ween, Her tribunitial pow'r, and purple pomp On thee confers, in living manners school'd To guard her weal, and vindicate her rights, O Ladbroke! once in the same fortunes class'd Of early life; with count'nance unestrang'd, For ev'ry friendly deed still vacant found! Nor can the Muse, while she these scenes surveys, Forget her Shenstone, in the youthful toil Associate; whose bright dawn of genius oft Smooth'd my incondite verse; whose friendly voice Call'd me from giddy sports to follow him Intent on better themes—call'd me to taste The charms of British song, the pictur'd page Admire, or mark his imitative skill; Or with him range in solitary shades, And scoop rude grottos in the shelving bank. Such were the joys that cheer'd life's early morn! Such the strong sympathy of soul, that knit Our hearts congenial in sweet amity! On Cherwel's banks, by kindred science nurs'd; And well-matur'd in life's advancing stage, When, on Ardenna's plain, we fondly stray'd, With mutual trust, and amicable thought; Or in the social circle gaily join'd: Or round his Leasowe's happy circuit rov'd; On hill, and dale invoking ev'ry Muse, Nor Tempe's shade, nor Aganippe's fount Envied; so willingly the Dryads nurs'd His groves; so lib'rally their crystal urns The Naiads pour'd, enchanted with his spells; And pleas'd to see their ever-flowing streams Led by his hand, in many a mazy line; Or, in the copious tide, collected large, Or tumbling from the rock, in sportive falls, Now, from the lofty bank, precipitate; And now, in gentler course, with murmurs soft Soothing the ear; and now, in concert join'd, Fall above fall, oblique, and intricate, Among the twisted roots. Ah! whilst I write, In deeper murmur flows the sadning stream; Wither the groves; and from the beauteous scene, Its soft enchantments fly. No more for me A charm it wears, since he alas! is gone, Whose genius plann'd it, and whose spirit grac'd. Ah! hourly does the fatal doom, pronounc'd Against rebellious sin, some social band Dissolve, and leave a thousand friends to weep, Soon such themselves, as those they now lament! This mournful tribute to thy mem'ry paid! The Muse pursues her solitary way; But heavily pursues, since thou art gone, Whose counsel brighten'd, and whose friendship shar'd The pleasing task. Now Bremicham! to thee She steers her flight, and, in thy busy scenes, Seeks to restrain awhile the starting tear. Yet ere her song describes the smoky forge, Or sounding anvil, to the dusky heath Her gentle train she leads. What? tho' no grain, Or herbage sweet, or waving woods adorn Its dreary surface, yet it bears, within, A richer treasury. So worthy minds Oft lurk beneath a rude, unsightly form. More hapless they! that few observers search, Studious to find this intellectual ore, And stamp, with gen'rous deed, its current worth. Here many a merchant turns adventurer, Encourag'd, not disgusted. Interest thus, On sordid minds, with stronger impulse works, Than virtue's heav'nly flame. Yet Providence Converts to gen'ral use man's selfish ends. Hence are the hungry fed, the naked cloath'd, The wintry damps dispell'd, and social mirth Exults, and glows before the blazing hearth. When likely signs th'adventrous search invite, A cunning artist tries the latent soil: And if his subtle engine, in return, A brittle mass contains of sable hue, Strait he prepares th'obstructing earth to clear, And raise the crumbling rock. A narrow pass Once made, wide, and more wide the gloomy cave Stretches its vaulted isles, by num'rous hands Hourly extended. Some the pick-axe ply, Loos'ning the quarry from its native bed. Some waft it into light. Thus the grim ore, Here useless, like the miser's brighter hoard, Is from its prison brought, and sent abroad, The frozen hours to cheer, to minister To needful sustenance, and polish'd arts. Mean while the subterraneous city spreads Its covert streets, and echoes with the noise Of swarthy slaves, and instruments of toil. They, such the force of Custom's pow'rful laws! Pursue their sooty labours, destitute Of the sun's cheering light, and genial warmth. And oft a chilling damp, or unctuous mist, Loos'd from the crumbly caverns, issues forth, Stopping the springs of life. And oft the flood, Diverted from its course, in torrents pours, Drowning the nether world. To cure these ills Philosophy two curious arts supplies, To drain th'imprison'd air, and, in its place, More pure convey, or, with impetuous force, To raise the gath'ring torrents from the deep. One from the The Ventilator. wind its salutary pow'r Derives, thy charity to sick'ning crowds, From cheerful haunts, and Nature's balmy draughts Confin'd; O friend of man, illustrious Dr. Stephen Hales. Hales! That, stranger still! its influence owes to air The Fire-engine., By cold, and heat alternate now condens'd, Now rarefied “Densat erant quæ rara modo, et quæ densa relaxat.”. Agent! to vulgar thought How seeming weak, in act how pow'rful seen! So Providence, by instruments despis'd, All human force, and policy confounds. But who that fiercer element can rule? When, in the nitrous cave, the kindling flame, By pitchy vapours fed, from cell to cell, With fury spreads, and the wide fewell'd earth, Around, with greedy joy, receives the blaze. By its own entrails nourish'd, like those mounts Vesuvian, or Ætnean, still it wastes, And still new fewel for its rapine finds Exhaustless. Wretched he! who journeying late, O'er the parch'd heath, bewilder'd, seeks his way. Oft will his snorting steed, with terror struck, His wonted speed refuse, or start aside, With rising smoak, and ruddy flame annoy'd. While, at each step, his trembling rider quakes, Appall'd with thoughts of bog, or cavern'd pit, Or treach'rous earth, subsiding where they tread, Tremendous passage to the realms of death! Yet want there not ev'n here some lucid spots The smoaky scene to cheer, and, by contrast, More fair. Such Dartmouth's cultivated Sandwel, the seat of the Right Hon. the Earl of Dartmouth. lawns! Himself, distinguish'd more with ornament Of cultur'd manners, and supernal light! Such Castle-Bromwick, the seat of Sir Henry Bridgman, Bart. thine, O Bridgman! Such—but envious time Forbids the Muse to these fair scenes to rove, Still minding her of her unfinish'd theme, From russet heaths, and smould'ring furnaces, To trace the progress of thy steely arts, Bremicham, alias Birmingham. Queen of the sounding anvil! Aston The seat of Sir Lister Holt, Bart. thee, And The seat of Sir Henry Gough, Bart. Edgbaston with hospitable shade, And rural pomp invest. O! warn thy sons; When, for a time, their labours they forget, Not to molest these peaceful solitudes. So may the masters of the beauteous scene, Protect thy commerce, and their toil reward. Nor does the barren soil conceal alone The sable rock inflammable. Oft-times More pond'rous ore beneath its surface lies, Compact, metallic, but with earthy parts Incrusted. These the smoaky kiln consumes, And to the furnace's impetuous rage Consigns the solid ore. In the fierce heat The pure dissolves, the dross remains behind. This push'd aside, the trickling metal flows Thro' secret valves along the channel'd floor, Where in the mazy moulds of figur'd sand, Anon it hardens. Now the busy forge Reiterates its blows, to form the bar Large, massy, strong. Another art expands, Another yet divides the yielding mass To many a taper length, fit to receive The artist's will, and take its destin'd form. Soon o'er thy furrow'd pavement, Bremicham! Ride the loose bars obstrep'rous; to the sons Of languid sense, and frame too delicate Harsh noise perchance, but harmony to thine. Instant innumerable hands prepare To shape, and mould the malleable ore. Their heavy sides th'inflated bellows heave, Tugged by the pulley'd line, and, with their blast Continuous, the sleeping embers rouse, And kindle into life. Strait the rough mass, Plung'd in the blazing hearth, its heat contracts, And glows transparent. Now, Cyclopean chief! Quick on the anvil lay the burning bar, And with thy lusty fellows, on its sides Impress the weighty stroke. See, how they strain The swelling nerve, and lift the sinewy “Illi inter sese magnâ vi brachia tollunt “In numerum, versantque tenaci forcipe ferrum. Virg. arm In measur'd time; while with their clatt'ring blows, From street to street the propagated sound Increasing echoes, and, on ev'ry side, The tortur'd metal spreads a radiant show'r. 'Tis noise, and hurry all! The thronged street, The close-piled warehouse, and the busy shop! With nimble stroke the tinkling hammers move; While slow, and weighty the vast sledge descends, In solemn base responsive, or apart, Or socially conjoin'd in tuneful peal. The rough file “Tum ferri rigor, et argutæ lamina serræ, “Tum variæ venere artes, &amp;c.” Virg. grates; yet useful is its touch, As sharp corrosives to the schirrhous flesh, Or, to the stubborn temper, keen rebuke. How the coarse metal brightens into fame Shap'd by their plastic hands! what ornament! What various use! See there the glitt'ring knife Of temper'd edge! The scissars' double shaft, Useless apart, in social union join'd, Each aiding each! Emblem how beautiful Of happy nuptial leagues! The button round, Plain, or imbost, or bright with steely rays! Or oblong buckle, on the lacker'd shoe, With polish'd lustre, bending elegant Its shapely rim. But who can count the forms That hourly from the glowing embers rise, Or shine attractive thro' the glitt'ring pane, And emulate their parent fires? what art “Sed neque quàm multæ species, nec nomina quæ sint, “Est numerus: neque enim numero comprêndere refert.” Virg.Can, in the scanty bounds of measur'd verse, Display the treasure of a thousand mines To wond'rous shapes by stubborn labour wrought? Nor this alone thy praise. Of various grains Thy sons a compound form, and to the fire Commit the precious mixture, if perchance Some glitt'ring mass may bless their midnight toil, Or glossy varnish, or enamel fair, To shame the pride of China, or Japan. Nor wanting is the graver's pointed steel, Nor pencil, wand'ring o'er the polish'd plate, With glowing tints, and mimic life endued. Thine too, of graceful form, the letter'd type! The friend of learning, and the poet's pride! Without thee what avail his splendid aims, And midnight labours? Painful drudgery! And pow'rless effort! But that thought of thee Imprints fresh vigour on his panting breast, As thou ere long shalt on his work impress; And, with immortal fame, his praise repay. Hail, native British Ore! of thee possess'd, We envy not Golconda's sparkling mines, Nor thine Potosi! nor thy kindred hills, Teeming with gold. What? tho' in outward form Less fair? not less thy worth. To thee we owe More riches than Peruvian mines can yield, Or Motezuma's crowded magazines, And palaces cou'd boast, though roof'd with gold. Splendid barbarity! and rich distress! Without the social arts, and useful toil; That polish life, and civilize the mind! These are thy gifts, which gold can never buy. Thine is the praise to cultivate the soil; To bare its inmost strata to the sun; To break, and meliorate the stiffen'd clay, And, from its close confinement, set at large Its vegetative virtue. Thine it is The with'ring hay, and ripen'd grain to sheer, And waft the joyous harvest round the land. Go now, and see if, to the Silver's edge, The reedy stalk will yield its bearded store, In weighty sheafs. Or if the stubborn marle, In sidelong rows, with easy force will rise Before the Silver plowshare's glitt'ring point. Or wou'd your gen'rous horses tread more safe On plated Gold? Your wheels, with swifter force On golden axles move? Then grateful own, Britannia's sons! Heav'n's providential love, That gave you real wealth, not wealth in shew, Whose price in bare imagination lies, And artificial compact. Thankful ply Your Iron arts, and rule the vanquish'd world. Hail, native Ore! without thy pow'rful aid, We still had liv'd in huts, with the green sod, And broken branches roof'd. Thine is the plane, The chissel thine; which shape the well-arch'd dome, The graceful portico; and sculptur'd walls. Wou'd ye your coarse, unsightly mines exchange For Mexiconian hills? to tread on gold, As vulgar sand? with naked limbs, to brave The cold, bleak air? to urge the tedious chace, By painful hunger stung, with artless toil, Thro' gloomy forests, where the sounding axe, To the sun's beam, ne'er op'd the cheerful glade, Nor culture's healthful face was ever seen? In squalid huts to lay your weary limbs, Bleeding, and faint, and strangers to the bliss Of home-felt ease, which British swains can earn, With a bare spade; but ill alas! cou'd earn, With spades of gold? Such the poor Indian's lot! Who starves 'midst gold, like misers o'er their bags; Not with like guilt! Hail, native British Ore! For thine is trade, that with its various stores, Sails round the world, and visits ev'ry clime, And makes the treasures of each clime her own, By gainful commerce of her woolly vests, Wrought by the spiky comb; or steely wares, From the coarse mass, by stubborn toil, refin'd. Such are thy peaceful gifts! And War to thee Its best support, and deadliest horror owes, The glitt'ring faulchion, and the thund'ring tube! At whose tremendous gleam, and volley'd fire, Barbarian kings fly from their useless hoards, And yield them all to thy superior pow'r. END OF BOOK THE THIRD. BOOK IV. EVENING.

Conclusion. In purple vestments clad, the temper'd sky Invites us from our hospitable roof, To taste her influence mild; while to the west The jocund sun his radiant chariot drives, With rapid course, untir'd. Ye nymphs, and swains! Now quit the shade, and, with recruited strength, Along the yet untroden terrace urge Your vig'rous steps. With moderated heat, And ray oblique, the sun shall not o'erpow'r, But kindly aid your yet unfinish'd search. Not after sable night, in silence hush'd, More welcome is th'approach of op'ning morn, ‘With song of early birds,’ than the fresh breeze Of soften'd air succeeding sultry heat, And the wild tumult of the buzzing day. Nor think, tho' much is past, that nought remains, Or nought of beauty, or attractive worth, Save what the morning-sun, or noon-tide ray, Hath, with his rising beam, distinctly mark'd, Or more confus'dly, with meridian blaze, Daz'ling display'd imperfect. Downward he Shall other hills illumine opposite, And other vales as beauteous as the past; Suggesting to the Muse new argument, And fresh instruction for her closing lay. There Dasset's ridgy mountain courts the song. Scarce Malvern boasts his adverse boundary More graceful. Like the tempest-driven wave, Irregularly great, his bare tops brave The winds, and, on his sides, the fat'ning ox Crops the rich verdure. When at Hastings' field, The Norman Conqueror a kingdom won In this fair Isle, and to another race The Saxon pow'r transferr'd; an alien The Earl of Mellent. lord, Companion of his toil! by sov'reign grant, These airy fields obtain'd. Now the tall Mount, By claim more just, a nobler master owns; To tyrant force, and slavish laws a foe. But happier lands, near Ouse's reedy shore, (What leisure ardent love of public weal Permits) his care employ; where Nature's charms With learned Art combin'd; the richest domes, And fairest lawns, adorn'd with ev'ry grace Of beauty, or magnificent design, By Cobham's eye approv'd, or Grenville plann'd, The villas of imperial Rome outvie; And form a scene of statelier pomp—a Stowe. Her walls the living boast, these boast the dead, Beneath their roof, in sacred dust entomb'd. Lie light, O earth! on that illustrious Dame Dame Hester Temple, of whom this is recorded by Fuller, in his account of Buckinghamshire, and who lies buried, with many of that ancient family, in the parish-church of Burton-Dasset., Who, from her own prolific womb deriv'd, To people thy green orb, successive saw Sev'n times an hundred births. A goodlier train! Than that, with which the Patriarch journey'd erst From Padan-Aram, to the Mamrean plains: Or that more num'rous, which, with large increase, At Joseph's call, in wond'rous caravans, Reviving sight! by Heav'n's decree prepar'd, He led to Goshen, Egypt's fruitful soil. Where the tall pillar lifts its taper head, Her spacious terrace, and surrounding lawns, Deckt with no sparing cost of planted tufts, Or ornamented building, The seat of William Holbech, Esq. Farnborough boasts. Hear they her master's call? in sturdy troops, The jocund labourers hie, and, at his nod, A thousand hands or smooth the slanting hill, Or scoop new channels for the gath'ring flood, And, in his pleasures, find substantial bliss. Nor shall thy verdant pastures be unsung An estate, and ancient seat, belonging to the Right Hon. Earl Spenser. Wormleighton! erst th'abode of Spenser's race, Their title now! What? tho' in height thou yield'st To Dasset, not in sweet luxuriance Of fatning herbage, or of rising groves; Beneath whose shade the lusty steers repose Their cumbrous limbs, mixt with the woolly tribes, And leisurely concoct their grassy meal. Her wood-capt summit The seat of Sir Ch. Shuckburgh, Bart. Shuckburgh there displays; Nor fears neglect, in her own worth secure, And glorying in the name her master bears. Nor will her scenes, with closer eye, survey'd, Frustrate the searcher's toil, if steepy hills, By frequent chasms disjoin'd, and glens profound, And broken precipices, vast, and rude Delight the sense; or Nature's lesser works, Tho' lesser, not less fair! or native stone, Or fish, the little The Astroites, or Star-stones, found here. Astroit's doubtful race, For starry rays, and pencil'd shades admir'd! Invite him to these fields, their airy bed. Where Leame and Ichene own a kindred rise, And haste their neighb'ring currents to unite, New hills arise, new pastures green, and fields With other harvests crown'd; with other charms Villas, and towns with other arts adorn'd. There Ichington its downward structures views In Ichene's passing wave, which, like the Mole, Her subterraneous journey long pursues, Ere to the sun she gives her lucid stream. Thy villa, The seat of Sir William Wheeler, Bart. Leamington! her sister nymph In her fair bosom shews; while, on her banks, As further she her liquid course pursues, Amidst surrounding woods his ancient walls The seat of Sir Theophilus Biddulph, Bart. Birb'ry conceals, and triumphs in the shade. Not such thy lot, O The seat of John Shuckburgh, Esq. Bourton! nor from sight Retirest thou, but, with complacent smile, Thy social aspect courts the distant eye, And views the distant scene reciprocal, Delighting, and delighted. Dusky heaths Succeed, as oft to mirth, the gloomy hour! Leading th'unfinish'd search to thy fam'd seat A Roman station, where the Foss-Way and Watling-street cross each other. Bennones! where two military ways Each other cross, transverse from sea to sea, The Romans hostile paths! There The seat of the Right Hon. the Earl of Denbeigh. Newnham's walls With graceful pride ascend, th'inverted pile In her clear stream, with flow'ry margin grac'd, Admiring. The seat of Sir Francis Skipwith, Bart. Newbold there her modest charms More bashfully unveils, with solemn woods, And verdant glades enamour'd. Here her lawns, And rising groves for future shelter form'd, Fair The seat of Dixwell Grimes, Esq. Coton wide displays. There Addison, With mind serene, his moral theme revolv'd, Instruction drest in Learning's fairest form! The gravest wisdom with the liveliest wit Attemper'd! or, beneath thy roof retir'd O The seat of the Right Hon. Joseph Addison, Esq. Bilton! much of peace, and liberty Sublimely mus'd, on Britain's weal intent, Or in thy shade the coy Pierians woo'd. Another theme demands the varying song. Lo! where but late the flocks, and heifers graz'd, Or yellow harvests wav'd, now, thro' the vale, Or o'er the plain, or round the slanting hill A glitt'ring path attracts the gazer's eye, Where sooty barques pursue their liquid track Thro' lawns, and woods, and villages remote From public haunt, which wonder as they pass. The channel'd road still onward moves, and still With level course, the flood attendant leads. Hills, dales oppose in vain. A thousand hands Now thro' the mountain's side a passage ope, Now with stupendous arches bridge the vale, Now over paths, and rivers urge their way Aloft in air. Again the Roman pride Beneath thy spacious camp embattled hill, O The Canal design'd for a communication between the Cities of Oxford and Coventry, passes through Brinklow, where is a magnificent aqueduct, consisting of twelve arches, with a high bank of earth at each end, crossing a valley beneath the vestiges of a Roman camp, and tumulus, on the Foss-Way. Brinklow! seems with gentler arts return'd. But Britain now no bold invader fears, No foreign aid invokes. Alike in arts Of peace, or war renown'd. Alike in both She rivals ancient Rome's immortal fame. Still villas fair, and populous towns remain— Polesworth, and Atherstone, and Eaton's walls To charity devote! and, Tamworth, thine To martial fame! and thine, O The seat of the late Edward Stratford, Esq; an extensive view to Charley Forest and Bosworth Field. Merival! Boasting thy beauteous woods, and lofty scite! Seat of the late Right Hon. Lord Digby, commonly called, the good Lord Digby.And Coleshill! long for momentary date Of human life, tho' for our wishes short, Repose of Digby's honourable age! Nor may the Muse, tho' on her homeward way Intent, short space refuse his alleys green, And decent walls with due respect to greet Blythe Hall, the seat of Sir William Dugdale, now belonging to Richard Geast, Esq.On Blythe's fair stream, to whose laborious toil She many a lesson owes, his painful search Enjoying without pain, and, at her ease, With equal love of native soil inspir'd, Singing in measur'd phrase her country's fame. The seat of Sir Roger Newdigate, Bart. Member of Parliament for the University of Oxford.Nor, Arbury! may we thy scenes forget, Haunt of the Naiads, and each woodland nymph! Rejoicing in his care, to whom adorn'd With all the graces which her schools expound, The gowny sons of Isis trust their own, And Britain's weal. Nor shall thy splendid walls, O The seat of the Right Hon. the Earl of Aylesford. Packington! allure the Muse in vain. The Goths no longer here their empire hold. The shaven terrac'd hill, slope above slope, And high impris'ning walls to Belgia's coast Their native clime retire.—In formal bounds The long canal no more confines the stream Reluctant.—Trees no more their tortur'd limbs Lament—no more the long-neglected fields, Like outlaws banish'd for some vile offence, Are hid from sight—from its proud reservoir Of amplest size, and fair indented form, Along the channel'd lawn the copious stream With winding grace the stately current leads. The channel'd lawn its bounteous stream repays, With ever-verdant banks, and cooling shades, And wand'ring paths, that emulate its course. On ev'ry side spreads wide the beauteous scene, Assemblage fair of plains, and hills, and woods, And plants of od'rous scent—plains, hills, and woods, And od'rous plants rejoice, and smiling hail The reign of Nature, while attendant Art Submissive waits to cultivate her charms. Hail happy land! which Nature's partial smile Hath robed profusely gay! whose champaigns wide With plenteous harvests wave; whose pastures swarm With horned tribes, or the sheep's fleecy race; To the thronged shambles yielding wholesome food, And various labour to man's active pow'rs, Not less benign than to the weary rest. Nor destitute thy woodland scenes of wealth, Or sylvan beauty! there the lordly swain His scantier fields improves; o'er his own realms Supreme, at will to sow his well-fenc'd glebe, With grain successive; or with juicy herbs, To swell his milky kine; or feed, at ease, His flock in pastures warm. His blazing hearth, With copious fewel heap'd, defies the cold; And housewife-arts or teize the tangled wool, Or, from the distaff's hoard, the ductile thread, With sportive hand entice; while to the wheel The sprightly carol join'd, or plaintive song Diffuse, and artless sooths th'untutor'd ear With heart-felt strains, and the slow task beguiles. Nor hath the sun, with less propitious ray, Shone on the masters of the various scene. Witness the splendid train! illustrious names, That claim precedence on the lists of fame, Nor fear oblivious time! enraptur'd Bards! Or learned Sages! gracing, with their fame, Their native soil, and my aspiring verse. Say, now my dear companions! for enough Of leisure to descriptive song is giv'n; Say, shall we, ere we part, with moral eye, The scene review, and the gay prospect close With observation grave, as sober eve Hastes now to wrap in shades the closing day? Perhaps the moral strain delights you not! Perhaps you blame the Muse's quick retreat; Intent to wander still along the plain, In coverts cool, lull'd by the murm'ring stream, Or gentle breeze; while playful fancy skims, With careless wing, the surfaces of things: For deep research too indolent, too light For grave reflection. So the Syren queen Tempted Alcides, on a flow'ry plain, With am'rous blandishment, and urg'd to waste His prime inglorious: but fair Virtue's form Rescued the yielding youth, and fir'd his breast To manly toil, and glory's well-earn'd prize. O! in that dang'rous season, O! beware Of Vice, envenom'd weed! and plant betimes The seeds of virtue in th'untainted heart. So on its fruit th'enraptur'd mind shall feast When, to the smiling day, and mirthful scene Night's solemn gloom, cold winter's chilling blasts, And pain, and sickness, and old age succeed. Nor slight your faithful guide, my gentle train! But, with a curious eye, expatiate free O'er Nature's moral plan. Tho' dark the theme, Tho' formidable to the sensual mind; Yet shall the Muse, with no fictitious aid, Inspir'd, still guide you with her friendly voice, And to each seeming ill some greater good Oppose, and calm your lab'ring thoughts to rest. Nature herself bids us be serious, Bids us be wise; and all her works rebuke The ever-thoughtless, ever-titt'ring tribe. What, tho' her lovely hills, and valleys smile To-day, in beauty drest? yet, ere three moons Renew their orb, and to their wane decline, Ere then the beauteous landscape all will fade; The genial airs retire; and shiv'ring swains Shall, from the whiten'd plain, and driving storm, Avert the smarting cheek, and humid eye. So some fair maid to time's devouring rage Her bloom resigns, and, with a faded look, Disgusts her paramour; unless thy charms, O Virtue! with more lasting beauty grace Her lovelier mind, and, thro' declining age, Fair deeds of piety, and modest worth, Still flourish, and endear her still the more. Nor always lasts the Landscape's gay attire Till surly Winter, with his ruffian blasts, Benumbs her tribes, and dissipates her charms. As sickness oft the virgin's early bloom Spoils immature, preventing hoary age, So blasts and mildews oft invade the fields In all their beauty, and their summer's pride. And oft the sudden show'r, or sweeping “Sæpe etiam immensum cælo venit agmen aquarum, “Et fædam glomerant tempestatem imbribus atris “Collectæ ex alto nubes; ruit arduus æther, “Et pluviâ ingenti sata læta, boumque labores “Diluit.” Virg. storm O'erflows the meads, and to the miry glebe Lays close the matted grain; with awful peal, While the loud thunder shakes a guilty world, And forked lightnings cleave the sultry skies. Nor does the verdant mead, or bearded field Alone the rage of angry skies sustain. Oft-times their influence dire the bleating flock, Or lowing herd assails, and mocks the force Of costly med'cine, or attendant care. Such late the wrathful pestilence, that seiz'd In pastures far retir'd, or guarded stalls, The dew-lap'd race! with plaintive lowings they, And heavy eyes, confess'd the pois'nous gale, And drank infection in each breath they drew. Quick thro' their veins the burning fever ran, And from their nostrils stream'd the putrid rheum Malignant; o'er their limbs faint languors crept, And stupefaction all their senses bound. In vain their master, with officious hand, From the pil'd mow the sweetest lock presents; Or anxiously prepares the tepid draught Balsamic; they the proffer'd dainty loath, And “Hinc lætis vituli vulgo moriuntur in herbis, “Et dulces animas plena ad præsepia reddunt.” Virg. Death exulting claims his destin'd prey. Nor seldom “Non tam creber agens hyemem ruit æthere turbo, “Quam multæ pecudum pestes, nec singula morbi “Corpora corripiunt, sed tota æstiva repentè “Spemque, gregemque simul, cunctamque ab origine gentem.” Virg. coughs, and watry rheums afflict The woolly tribes, and on their vitals seize; Thinning their folds; and, with their mangled limbs, And tatter'd fleeces, the averted eye Disgusting, as the squeamish traveller, With long-suspended breath, hies o'er the plain. And is their lord, proud Man! more safe than they? More privileg'd from the destroying breath, That, thro' the secret shade, in darkness walks, Or smites whole pastures at the noon of day? Ah! no, Death mark'd him from his infant birth; Mark'd for his own, and, with envenom'd touch, His vital blood defil'd. Thro' all his veins The subtle poison creeps; compounded joins Its kindred mass to his increasing bulk; And, to the rage of angry elements, Betrays his victim, poor, ill-fated Man; Not surer born to live, than born to die! In what a sad variety of forms Clothes he his messengers? Deliriums wild! Inflated dropsy! slow consuming cough! Jaundice, and gout, and stone; convulsive spasms; The shaking head, and the contracted limb; And ling'ring atrophy, and hoary age; And second childhood, slack'ning ev'ry nerve, To joy, to reason, and to duty dead! I know thee, who thou art, offspring of Sin, And Satan! nurs'd in Hell, and then let loose To range, with thy accursed train, on earth, When man, apostate man! by Satan's wiles, From life, from bliss, from God, and goodness fell! Who knows thee not? who feels thee not within, Plucking his heart-strings? whom hast thou not robb'd Of parent, wife, or friend, as thou hast me? Glutting the grave with ever-crowding guests, And, with their image, sad'ning ev'ry scene, Less peopled with the living than the dead! Thro' populous streets the never-ceasing bell Proclaims, with solemn sound, the parting breath; Nor seldom from the village-tow'r is heard The mournful knell. Alike the grassy ridge, With osiers bound, and vaulted catacomb, His spoils inclose. Alike the simple stone, And mausoleum proud, his pow'r attest, In wretched doggrel, or elab'rate verse. Perhaps the peasant's humble obsequies; The flowing sheet, and pall of rusty hue, Alarm you not. You slight the simple throng; And for the nodding plumes, and scutcheon'd hearse, Your tears reserve. Then mark, o'er yonder plain, The grand procession suited to your taste. I mock you not. The sable pursuivants Proclaim th'approaching state. Lo! now the plumes! The nodding plumes, and scutcheon'd hearse appear! And clad in mournful weeds, a long sad train Of slowly-moving pomp, that waits on death! Nay—yet another melancholy train! Another triumph of the ghastly fiend Succeeds! 'Tis so. Perhaps ye have not heard The mournful tale. Perhaps no messenger Hath warn'd you to attend the solemn deed! Then from the Muse the piteous story learn; And, with her, on the grave procession wait, That to their early tomb, to mould'ring dust Of ancestors, that crowd the scanty vault, Near which our song began, The Right Hon. the Earl of Northampton, who died on his return from an embassy to Venice, while the Author was writing this poem. Northampton bears, The gay Northampton, and his beauteous The Right Hon. the Countess of Northampton, daughter to the Duke of Beaufort. Bride! Far other pageants in his youthful breast He cherish'd, while, with delegated trust, On stately ceremonials, to the shore, Where Adria's waves the sea-girt city lave, He went; and, with him, join'd in recent love, His blooming Bride, of Beaufort's royal line, The charming Somerset! But royal blood, Nor youth, nor beauty, nor employment high, Cou'd grant protection from the rude assault Of that barbarian Death; who, without form, To courts and cottages unbidden comes; And his unwelcome embassy fulfils, Without distinction, to the lofty peer, The graceful bride, or peasant's homely race. Ere, from her native soil, she saw the sun Run half his annual course, in Latian climes, She breath'd her last; him, ere that course was done, Death met returning on the Gallic plains, And sent to join her yet unburied dust: Who, but this youthful pair's untimely fate Must weep, who, but in theirs, may read their own? Another lesson seek ye, other proof Of vanity, and lamentable woe Betiding man? Another scene to grace With troops of victims the terrific king, And humble wanton Folly's laughing sons? The Muse shall from her faithful memory A tale select; a tale big with the fate Of kings, and heroes on this now fair field Embattled! but her song shall to your view Their ranks embody, and, to future peace, Their fierce designs, and hostile rage convert. Not on Pharsalia's plain a bolder strife Was held, tho' twice with Roman blood distain'd, Than when thy subjects, first imperial Charles! Dared, in these fields, with arms their cause to plead. A Roman camp at Warmington, on the top of Edge-Hill.Where once the Romans pitch'd their hostile tents, Other Campanias fair, and milder Alps Exploring, now a nobler warrior stood, His country's sov'reign liege! Around his camp A gallant train of loftiest rank attend, By loyalty, and love of regal sway, To mighty deeds impell'd. Mean while below Others no less intrepid courage boast, From source as fair, the love of Liberty! Dear Liberty! when rightly understood, Prime social bliss! Oh! may no fraud Usurp thy name, to veil their dark designs Of vile ambition, or licentious rage! Long time had they, with charge of mutual blame, And fierce debate of speech, discordant minds Avow'd, yet not to desp'rate chance of war 'Till now their cause referr'd: rude arbiter Of fit, and right! Unhappy native land! Nought then avail'd that Nature form'd thy fields So fair, and with her wat'ry barrier fenc'd! Nought then avail'd thy forms of guardian laws, The work of ages, in a moment lost, And ev'ry social tie at once dissolv'd! For now no more sweet peace, and order fair, And kindred love remain'd, but hostile rage Instead, and mutual jealousy, and hate, And tumult loud! nor, hadst thou then been there, The Rev. Mr. Talbot, of Kineton.O Talbot! cou'd thy voice, so often heard On heav'nly themes! nor Ch. Henry Talbot, Esq; of Marston, at the bottom of Edge-Hill. his fraternal! skill'd In social claims, the limits to define Of law, and right, have calm'd the furious strife, Or still'd the rattling thunder of the field. Across the plain, where the slight eminence, And scatter'd hedge-rows mark a midway space To yonder Kineton, alias Kington. So called, as some conjecture, from a castle on a neighbouring hill, said to have been a palace belonging to King John. town, once deem'd a royal court; Now harbouring no friends to royalty! The popular troops their martial lines extend. High on the hill, the royal banners wave Their faithful signals. Rang'd along the steep, The glitt'ring files, in burnish'd armour clad, Reflect the downward sun; and, with its gleam, The distant crowds affright, who trembling wait For the dire onset, and the dubious fight. As pent-up waters, swell'd by sudden rains, Their former bounds disdain, and foam, and rage Impatient of restraint; till, at some breach, Outward they burst impetuous, and mock The peasant's feeble toil, which strives to check Their headlong torrent; so the royal troops, With martial rage inflam'd, impatient wait The trumpet's summons. At its sprightly call, The airy seat they leave, and down the steep, Rank following rank, like wave succeeding wave, Rush on the hostile wings. Dire was the shock, Dire was the clash of arms! The hostile wings Give way, and soon in flight their safety seek. They, with augmented force, and growing rage The flying foe pursue. But too secure, And counting of cheap conquest quickly gain'd O'er dastard minds, in wordy quarrels bold, But slack by deeds to vindicate their claim, In chace, and plunder long they waste the day, And late return, of order negligent. Mean while the battle in the centre rag'd With diff'rent fortune, by bold Essex led, Experienc'd chief! and to the monarch's cause, And youthful race, for martial deeds unripe, Menac'd destruction. In the royal breast High passions rose, by native dignity Made more sublime, and urg'd to pow'rful act By strong, Prince Charles, afterwards King Charles II. and his brother the Duke of York, afterwards King James II. were then in the field, the former being in the 13th, and the latter just enter'd into the 10th year of his age. paternal love, and proud disdain Of vulgar minds, arraigning in his race The rights of sov'reignty, from ancient kings In order fair deriv'd. Amidst his troops With haste he flies, their broken ranks reforms, To bold revenge re-animates their rage, And from the foe his short-liv'd honour wrests. Now Death, with hasty stride, stalks o'er the field, Grimly exulting in the bloody fray. Now on the crested helm or burnish'd shield, He stamps new horrors; now the levell'd sword With weightier force impells, with iron-hoof Now tramples on th'expiring ranks; or gores The foaming steed against th'opposing spear. But chiefly on the cannon's brazen orb He sits triumphant, and, with fatal aim, Involves whole squadrons in the sulph'rous storm. Then Earl of Lindsey, the King's general. Lindsey fell, nor from the shelt'ring straw, Ceas'd he to plead his sov'reign's slighted cause Amidst surrounding foes; nor but with life, Expir'd his loyalty. His valiant son Lord Willoughby, son to the Earl of Lindsey. Attempts his rescue, but attempts in vain! Then Sir Edmund Verney, standard-bearer to the king. Verney too, with many a gallant knight, And faithful courtier, anxious for thy weal, Unhappy Prince! but mindless of their own, Pour'd out his life upon the crimson plain. Then fell the gallant Lord Stewart. Stewart, Lord Aubigny, son to the Duke of Lenox. Aubigny, Captain Kingsmill, buried at Radway; whose monument see at the end of the Poem.And Kingsmill! He whose monumental stone Protects his neighb'ring ashes, and his fame. The closing day compos'd the furious strife: But for short time compos'd! anon to wake With tenfold rage, and spread a wider scene Of terror, and destruction o'er the land! Now mark the glories of the great debate! Yon' grass-green mount, where waves the planted pine, And whispers to the winds the mournful tale, Contains them in its monumental mould; A slaughter'd crew, promiscuous lodg'd below! Still as the plowman breaks the clotted glebe, He ever and anon some trophy finds, The “Scilicet et tempus veniet, cum finibus illis, “Agricola incurvo terram molitus aratro, “Exesa inveniet scabrâ rubigine pila, “Aut gravibus rastris galeas pulsabit inanes, “Grandiaque effoffis mirabitur ossa sepulchris.” Virg. relicks of the war—or rusty spear, Or canker'd ball; but, from sepulchral soil, Cautious he turns aside the shining steel, Lest haply, at its touch, uncover'd bones Should start to view, and blast his rural toil. Such were the fruits of Passion, froward Will, And unsubmitting Pride! Worse storms than those That rend the sky, and waste our cultur'd fields! Strangers alike to man's primæval state, Ere Evil entrance found to this fair world, Permitted, not ordain'd, whatever Pride May dream of order in a world of sin, Or pre-existent soul, and penal doom For crimes unknown. More wise, more happy he! Who in his breast oft pond'ring, and perplext With endless doubt, and learning's fruitless toil, His weary mind at length reposes sure On Heav'n's attested oracles. To them Submiss he bows, convinc'd, however weak His reason the mysterious plan to solve, That all He wills is right, who, ere the worlds Were form'd, in his all-comprehensive mind, Saw all that was, or is, or e'er shall be. Who to whate'er exists, or lives, or moves, Throughout creation's wide extent, gave life, Gave being, pow'r, and thought to act, to move Impelling, or impell'd, to all ordain'd Their ranks, relations, and dependencies, And can direct, suspend, controul their pow'rs, Else were he not supreme! Who bids the winds Be still, and they obey; who to the sea Assigns its bounds, and calms its boisterous waves. Who, with like ease can moral discord rule, And all apparent evil turn to good. Hail then, ye sons of Eve! th'unerring guide, The sovereign grant receive, sin's antidote! A cure for all our griefs! So heav'nly Truth Shall wide display her captivating charms, And Peace her dwelling fix with human race. So Love thro' ev'ry clime his gentle reign Shall spread, and at his call discordant realms Shall beat their swords to plowshares, and their spears To pruning-hooks, nor more learn murth'rous war. So when revolving years, by Heav'n's decree, Their circling course have run, new firmaments, With blessings fraught, shall fill the bright expanse, Of tempests void, and thunder's angry voice. New verdure shall arise to cloathe the fields: New Edens! teeming with immortal fruit! No more the wing'd inhabitants of air Or those that range the fields, or skim the flood, Their fierceness shall retain, but brute with brute, And all with man in amicable league Shall join, and enmity for ever cease. Remains there aught to crown the rapt'rous theme? 'Tis this, unfading joy, beyond the reach Of elemental worlds, and short-liv'd time. This too is yours—from outward sense conceal'd, But, by resemblance of external things, Inward display'd, to elevate the soul To thoughts sublime, and point her way to Heav'n. So, from the top of Nebo's lofty mount, The patriot-leader of Jehovah's sons The promis'd land survey'd; to Canaan's race A splendid theatre of frantic joys, And fatal mirth, beyond whose scanty bounds Darkness, and horror dwell! Emblem to him Of fairer fields, and happier seats above! Then closed his eyes to mortal scenes, to wake In the bright regions of eternal day. THE END. LABOUR, AND GENIUS: OR, THE Mill-Stream, and the Cascade. A FABLE. INSCRIBED TO WILLIAM SHENSTONE, Esq. ? “discordia Semina rerum.” Ovid. Nature, with lib'ral hand, dispenses Her apparatus of the senses, In articles of gen'ral use, Nerves, sinews, muscles, bones profuse. Distinguishing her fav'rite race With form erect, and featur'd face: The flowing hair, the polish'd skin— But, for the furniture within, Whether it be of brains, or lead, What matters it, so there's a head? For wisest noddle seldom goes, But as 'tis led by corp'ral nose. Nor is it thinking much, but doing, That keeps our tenements from ruin. And hundreds eat, who spin, or knit, For one that lives by dint of wit. The sturdy thresher plies his flail, And what to this doth wit avail? Who learns from wit to press the spade? Or thinks 'twou'd mend the cobler's trade? The pedlar, with his cumb'rous pack, Carries his brains upon his back. Some wear them in full-bottom'd wig, Or hang them by with queue, or pig. Reduc'd, till they return again, In dishabille, to common men. Then why, my friend, is wit so rare? That sudden flash, that makes one stare! A meteor's blaze, a dazzling shew! Say what it is, for well you know. Or, if you can with patience hear A witless Fable, lend an ear. BETWIXT two sloping verdant hills, A Current pour'd its careless rills, Which unambitious crept along, With weeds, and matted grass o'erhung. Till rural Genius, on a day, Chancing along its banks to stray, Remark'd with penetrating look The latent merits of the Brook, Much griev'd to see such talents hid, And thus the dull by-standers chid. How blind is man's incurious race, The scope of Nature's plans to trace? How do ye mangle half her charms, And fright her hourly with alarms? Disfigure now her swelling mounds, And now contract her spacious bounds? Fritter her fairest lawns to alleys, Bare her green hills, and hide her valleys? Confine her streams with rule and line, And counteract her whole design? Neglecting, where she points the way, Her easy dictates to obey? To bring her hidden worth to sight; And place her charms in fairest light? Alike to intellectuals blind, 'Tis thus you treat the youthful mind; Mistaking gravity for sense, For dawn of wit, impertinence. The boy of genuine parts, and merit, For some unlucky prank of spirit, With frantic rage is scourg'd from school, And branded with the name of fool, Because his active blood flow'd faster Than the dull puddle of his master. While the slow plodder trots along, Thro' thick and thin, thro' prose and song, Insensible of all their graces, But learn'd in words, and common phrases: Till in due time he's mov'd to college, To ripen these choice seeds of knowledge. So some taste-pedant, wond'rous wise, Exerts his genius in dirt-pies. Delights the tonsile yew to raise, But hates your laurels, and your bays, Because too rambling, and luxuriant, Like forward youths, of brains too prurient. Makes puns, and anagrams in box, And turns his trees to bears, and cocks. Excels in quaint jette-d'eau, or fountain, Or leads his stream across a mountain, To shew its shallowness, and pride, In a broad grin, on t'other side. Perverting all the rules of sense, Which never offers violence, But gently leads where Nature tends, Sure, with applause, to gain its ends. But one example may teach more, Than precepts hackney'd o'er, and o'er. Then mark this Rill, with weeds o'erhung, Unnotic'd by the vulgar throng! Ev'n this, conducted by my laws, Shall rise to fame, attract applause; Instruct in See Fable XLI. and LI. in Dodsley's new-invented Fables, and many little pieces printed in the public papers. fable, shine in song, And be the theme of ev'ry tongue. He said: and, to his fav'rite son, Consign'd the task, and will'd it done. Damon his counsel wisely weigh'd, And carefully the scene survey'd. And, tho' it seems he said but little, He took his meaning to a tittle. And first, his purpose to befriend, A bank he rais'd at th'upper end: Compact, and close its outward side, To stay, and swell the gath'ring tide: But, on its inner, rough and tall, A ragged cliff, a rocky wall. The channel next he op'd to view, And, from its course, the rubbish drew. Enlarg'd it now, and now, with line Oblique, pursued his fair design. Preparing here the mazy way, And there the fall for sportive play. The precipice abrupt, and steep, The pebbled road, and cavern deep. The rooty seat, where best to view The fairy scene, at distance due. He last invok'd the Dryads aid, And fring'd the borders round with shade. Tap'stry, by Nature's fingers wove, No mimic, but a real grove: Part hiding, part admitting day, The scene to grace the future play. Damon perceives, with ravish'd eyes, The beautiful enchantment rise. Sees sweetly blended shade, and light, Sees ev'ry part with each unite. Sees each, as he directs, assume A livelier dye, or deeper gloom: So, fashion'd by the painter's skill, New forms the glowing canvas fill. So, to the summer's sun, the rose, And jessamin their charms disclose. While, all intent on this retreat, He saw his fav'rite work compleat, Divine enthusiasm seiz'd his breast, And thus his transport he express'd. “Let others toil, for wealth, or pow'r, I court the sweetly-vacant hour: Down life's smooth current calmly glide, Nor vex'd with cares, nor rack'd with pride. Give me, O Nature! to explore Thy lovely charms, I ask no more. For thee I fly from vulgar eyes, For thee I vulgar cares despise. For thee Ambition's charms resign; Accept a vot'ry, wholly thine. Yet still let Friendship's joys be near, Still, on these plains, her train appear. By Learning's sons my haunts be trod, And Stamford's feet imprint my sod. For Stamford oft hath deign'd to stray Around my Leasow's flow'ry way. And, where his honour'd steps have rov'd, Oft have his gifts those scenes improv'd. To him I'll dedicate my cell, To him suspend the votive spell. His name shall heighten ev'ry charm, His name protect my groves from harm, Protect my harmless sport from blame, And turn obscurity to fame.” He spake. His hand the pencil guides, And The scene here referr'd to, was inscribed to the Right Hon. the Earl of Stamford; but since to William Shenstone, Esq. Stamford o'er the scene presides. The proud device, with borrow'd grace, Conferr'd new lustre on the place: As books, by dint of dedication, Enjoy their patron's reputation. Now, launching from its lofty shore, The loosen'd stream began to roar: As headlong, from the rocky mound, It rush'd into the vast profound. There checkt awhile, again it flow'd Glitt'ring along the channel'd road: From steep to steep, a frequent fall, Each diff'rent, and each natural. Obstructing roots and rocks between, Diversify th'enchanted scene; While winding now, and intricate, Now more develop'd, and in state, Th'united Stream, with rapid force, Pursues amain its downward course, Till at your feet absorb'd, it hides Beneath the ground its bustling tides. With prancing steeds, and liv'ried trains, Soon daily shone the bord'ring plains. And distant sounds foretold th'approach Of frequent chaise, and crowded coach. For sons of Taste, and daughters fair, Hasted the sweet surprize to share: While The seat of the Right Hon. Lord Lyttelton, distant but a few miles from the Leasows. Hagley wonder'd at their stay, And hardly brook'd the long delay. Not distant far below, a Mill Was built upon a neighb'ring Rill: Whose pent-up stream, whene'er let loose, Impell'd a wheel, close at its sluice, So strongly, that, by friction's pow'r, 'Twou'd grind the firmest grain to flow'r. Or, by a correspondence new, With hammers, and their clatt'ring crew, Wou'd so bestir her active stumps, On iron-blocks, tho' arrant lumps, That, in a trice, she'd manage matters, To make 'em all as smooth as platters. Or slit a bar to rods quite taper, With as much ease, as you'd cut paper. For, tho' the lever gave the blow, Yet it was lifted from below; And wou'd for ever have lain still, But for the bustling of the Rill; Who, from her stately pool, or ocean, Put all the weels, and logs in motion; Things in their nature very quiet, Tho' making all this noise, and riot. This Stream, that cou'd in toil excel, Began with foolish pride to swell: Piqu'd at her neighbour's reputation, And thus express'd her indignation. “Madam! methinks you're vastly proud, You was'nt us'd to talk so loud. Nor cut such capers in your pace, Marry! what anticks, what grimace! For shame! don't give yourself such airs, In flaunting down those hideous stairs. Nor put yourself in such a flutter, Whate'er you do, you dirty gutter! I'd have you know, you upstart minx! Ere you were form'd, with all your sinks, A Lake I was, compar'd with which, Your Stream is but a paltry Ditch: And still, on honest Labour bent, I ne'er a single flash mispent. And yet no folks of high degree, Wou'd e'er vouchsafe to visit me, As, in their coaches, by they rattle, Forsooth! to hear your idle prattle. Tho' half the business of my flooding Is to provide them cakes, and pudding: Or furnish stuff for many a trinket, Which, tho' so fine, you scarce wou'd think it, When An eminent merchant, and very ingenious mechanic, at the So-ho Manufactory, near Birmingham. Boulton's skill has fix'd their beauty, To my rough toil first ow'd their duty. But I'm plain Goody of the Mill; And you are—Madam Cascadille!” “Dear Coz, reply'd the beauteous Torrent, Pray do not discompose your current. That we all from one fountain flow, Hath been agreed on long ago. Varying our talents, and our tides, As chance, or education guides. That I have either note, or name, I owe to Him who gives me fame. Who teaches all our kind to flow, Or gaily swift, or gravely slow. Now in the lake, with glassy face, Now moving light, with dimpled grace. Now gleaming from the rocky height, Now, in rough eddies, foaming white. Nor envy me the gay, or great, That visit my obscure retreat. None wonders that a clown can dig, But 'tis some art to dance a jig. Your talents are employ'd for use, Mine to give pleasure, and amuse. And tho', dear Coz, no folks of taste Their idle hours with you will waste, Yet many a grist comes to your mill, Which helps your master's bags to fill. While I, with all my notes, and trilling, For Damon never got a shilling.

A PASTORAL-ECLOGUE. To A LADY. Damon, and Lycidas. When o'er the Western world fair Science spread Her genial ray, and Gothic darkness fled, To Britain's Isle the Muses took their way, And taught her list'ning groves the tuneful lay. 'Twas then two Swains the Doric reed essay'd To sing the praises of a peerless maid. On Arden's blissful plain her seat she chose, And hence her rural name Ardenna rose. In sportive verse alternately they vied, Thus Damon sang, and Lycidas replied. Damon. Here, gentle Swain, beneath the shade reclin'd, Remit thy labours, and unbend thy mind. Well with the shepherd's state our cares agree, For Nature prompts to pleasing industry. 'Tis this to all her gifts fresh beauty yields, Health to our flocks, and plenty to our fields. Yet hath she not impos'd unceasing toil, Not restless plowshares always vex the soil. Then, Shepherd, take the blessings Heav'n bestows, Assist the song, and sweeten our repose. Lycidas. While others, sunk in sleep, or live in vain, Or, slaves of indolence, but wake to pain, Me let the call of earliest birds invite To hail th'approaches of returning light; To taste the freshness of the chearful morn, While glist'ring dew-drops hang on ev'ry thorn. Hence all the bliss that centers in our kind, Health to the blood, and vigour to the mind. Hence ev'ry task its meet attendance gains, And leisure hence to listen to thy strains. Damon. Thrice happy swain, so fitly form'd to share The shepherd's labour, and Ardenna's care! To tell Ardenna's praise the rural train Inscribe the verse, or chant it o'er the plain. Plains, hills, and woods return the well-known sound, And the smooth beech records the sportive wound. Then, Lycidas, let us the chorus join, So bright a theme our music shall refine. Escap'd from all the busy world admires, Hither the philosophic dame retires; For in the busy world, or poets feign, Intemp'rate vice, and giddy pleasures reign; Then, when from crowds the Loves, and Graces flew, To these lone shades the beauteous maid withdrew, To study Nature in this calm retreat, And with confed'rate Art her charms compleat. How sweet their union is, ye shepherds, say, And thou who form'dst the reed inspire my lay. Her praise I sing by whom our flocks are freed From the rough bramble, and envenom'd weed; Who to green pastures turns the dreary waste, With scatter'd woods in careless beauty grac'd. 'Tis she, Ardenna! Guardian of the scene, Who bids the mount to swell, who smooths the green, Who drains the marsh, and frees the struggling flood From its divided rule, and strife with mud. She winds its course the copious stream to shew, And she in swifter currents bids it flow; Now smoothly gliding with an even pace, Now dimpling o'er the stones with roughen'd grace: With glassy surface now serenely bright, Now foaming from the rock all silver white. 'Tis she the rising bank with beeches crowns, Now spreads the scene, and now contracts its bounds. Cloaths the bleak hill with verdure ever gay, And bids our feet thro' myrtle-valleys stray. She for her shepherds rears the rooty shed, The checquer'd pavement, and the straw-wove bed. For them she scoops the grotto's cool retreat, From storms a shelter, and a shade in heat. Directs their hands the verdant arch to bend, And with the leafy roof its gloom extend. Shells, flint, and ore their mingled graces join, And rocky fragments aid the chaste design. Lycidas. Hail happy lawns! where'er we turn our eyes, Fresh beauties bloom, and opening wonders rise. Whileome these charming scenes with grief I view'd A barren waste, a dreary solitude! My drooping flocks their russet pastures mourn'd, And lowing herds the plaintive moan return'd. With weary feet from field to field they stray'd, Nor found their hunger's painful sense allay'd. But now no more a dreary scene appears, No more its prickly boughs the bramble rears, No more my flocks lament th'unfruitful soil, Nor mourn their ragged fleece, or fruitless toil. Damon. As this fair lawn excels the rushy mead, As firs the thorn, and flow'rs the pois'nous weed, Far as the warbling sky-larks soar on high, Above the clumsy bat, or buzzing fly; So matchless moves Ardenna o'er the green, In mind alike excelling as in mien. Lycidas. Sweet is the fragrance of the damask rose, And bright the dye that on its surface glows, Fair is the poplar rising on the plain, Of shapely trunk, and lofty branches vain; But neither sweet the rose, nor bright its dye, Nor poplar fair, if with her charms they vie. Damon. Grateful is sunshine to the sportive lambs, The balmy dews delight the nibbling dams; But kindlier warmth Ardenna's smiles impart, A balm more rich her lessons to the heart. Lycidas. No more Pomona's guiding hand we need, Nor Flora's help to paint th'enamell'd mead, Nor Ceres' care to guard the rising grain, And spread the yellow plenty o'er the plain; Ardenna's precepts ev'ry want supply, The grateful lay what shepherd can deny? Damon. A theme so pleasing, with the day begun, Too soon were ended with the setting sun. But see o'er yonder hill the parting ray, And hark! our bleating flocks reprove our stay. The SCAVENGERS. A TOWN-ECLOGUE. “Dulcis odor lucri ox re quâlibet.” Awake, my Muse, prepare a loftier theme. The winding valley, and the dimpled stream Delight not all: quit, quit the verdant field, And try what dusty streets, and alleys yield. Where Avon wider flows, and gathers fame, Stands a fair town, and Warwick is its name. For useful arts entitled once to share The gentle Ethelfleda's guardian care. Nor less for deeds of chivalry renown'd, When her own Guy was with her laurels crown'd. Now Syren Sloth holds here her tranquil reign, And binds in silken bonds the feeble train. No frowning knights in uncouth armour lac'd, Seek now for monsters on the dreary waste: In these soft scenes they chace a gentler prey, No monsters! but as dangerous as they. In diff'rent forms as sure destruction lies, They have no claws 'tis true—but they have eyes. Last of the toiling race there liv'd a pair, Bred up in labour, and inur'd to care! To sweep the streets their task from sun to sun, And seek the nastiness which others shun. More plodding wight, or dame you ne'er shall see, He Gaffer Pestel hight, and Gammer she. As at their door they sate one summer's day, Old Pestel first essay'd the plaintive lay: His gentle mate the plaintive lay return'd, And thus alternately their cares they mourn'd. Old Pestel. Alas! was ever such fine weather seen, How dusty are the roads, the streets how clean! How long, ye Almanacks! will it be dry? Empty my cart how long, and idle I! Ev'n at the best the times are not so good, But 'tis hard work to scrape a livelihood. The cattle in the stalls resign their life, And baulk the shambles, and th'unbloody knife. While farmers sit at home in pensive gloom, And turnpikes threaten to compleat my doom. Wife. Well! for the turnpike that will do no hurt, Some say the managers are friends to dirt. But much I fear this murrain where 'twill end, For sure the cattle did our door befriend. Oft have I hail'd 'em, as they stalk'd along, Their fat the butchers pleas'd, but me their dung. Old Pestel. See what a little dab of dirt is here! But yields all Warwick more, O tell me where? Yet, on this spot, tho' now so naked seen, Heaps upon heaps, and loads on loads have been. Bigger, and bigger, the proud dunghill grew, Till my diminish'd house was hid from view. Wife. Ah! Gaffer Pestel, what brave days were those, When higher than our house our muckhill rose! The growing mount I view'd with joyful eyes, And mark'd what each load added to its size. Wrapt in its fragrant steam we often sate, And to its praises held delightful chat. Nor did I e'er neglect my mite to pay, To swell the goodly heap from day to day. A cabbage once I bought; but small the cost— Nor do I think the farthing all was lost. Again you sold its well-digested store, To dung the garden where it grew before. Old Pestel. What tho' the beaus, and powder'd coxcombs jeer'd, And at the scavenger's employment sneer'd, Yet then at night content I told my gains, And thought well paid their malice, and my pains. Why toils the tradesman, but to swell his store? Why craves the wealthy landlord still for more? Why will our gentry flatter, fawn, and lie? Why pack the cards, and what d'ye call't—the die? All, all the pleasing paths of gain pursue, And wade thro' thick, and thin, as we folks do. Sweet is the scent that from advantage springs, And nothing dirty which good int'rest brings. Wife. When goody Dobbins call'd me nasty bear, And talk'd of kennels, and the ducking-chair, With patience I cou'd hear the scolding quean, For sure 'twas dirtiness that kept me clean. Clean was my gown on Sundays, if not fine, Nor Mrs. ?'s cap so white as mine. A slut in silk, or kersey is the same, Nor sweetest always is the finest dame. Thus wail'd they pleasure past, and present cares, While the starv'd hog join'd his complaint with theirs. To still his grunting diff'rent ways they tend, To Names of the most remote, and opposite parts of the Town. West-Street he, and she to Names of the most remote, and opposite parts of the Town. Cotton-End. ABSENCE. With leaden foot Time creeps along While Delia is away, With her, nor plaintive was the song, Nor tedious was the day. Ah! envious pow'r! reverse my doom, Now double thy career, Strain ev'ry nerve, stretch ev'ry plume, And rest them when she's here. To a LADY. When Nature joins a beauteous face With shape, and air, and life, and grace, To ev'ry imperfection blind, I spy no blemish in the mind. When wit flows pure from Stella's tongue, Or animates the sprightly song, Our hearts confess the pow'r divine, Nor lightly prize its mortal shrine. Good-nature will a conquest gain, Tho' wit, and beauty sigh in vain. When gen'rous thoughts the breast inspire, I wish its rank, and fortunes higher. When Sidney's charms again unite To win the soul, and bless the sight, Fair, and learn'd, and good, and great! An earthly goddess is compleat. But when I see a sordid mind With affluence, and ill-nature join'd, And pride without a grain of sense, And without beauty insolence, The creature with contempt I view, And sure 'tis like Miss—you know who. To a LADY working a Pair of RUFFLES. What means this useless cost, this wanton pride? To purchase fopp'ry from yon' foreign strand! To spurn our native stores, and arts aside, And drain the riches of a needy land! Pleas'd I survey, fair nymph, your happy skill, Yet view it by no vulgar critic's laws: With nobler aim I draw my sober quill, Anxious to list each art in Virtue's cause. Go on, dear maid, your utmost pow'r essay, And if for fame your little bosom heave, Know patriot-hands your merit shall display, And amply pay the graces they receive. Let ev'ry nymph like you the gift prepare, And banish foreign pomp, and costly show; What lover but wou'd burn the prize to wear, Or blush by you pronounc'd his country's foe? Your smiles can win when patriot-speeches fail, Your frowns controul when justice threats in vain, O'er stubborn minds your softness can prevail, And placemen drop the bribe if you complain. Then rise the guardians of your country's fame, Or wherefore were ye form'd like angels fair? By beauty's force our venal hearts reclaim, And save the drooping Virtues from despair. FEMALE EMPIRE. A TRUE HISTORY. Like Bruin's was Avaro's breast, No softness harbour'd there; While Sylvio some concern express'd, When beauty shed a tear. In Hymen's bands they both were tied, As The parish-register. Cupid's archives shew ye; Proud Celia was Avaro's bride, And Sylvio's gentle Chloe. Like other nymphs, at church they swore, To honour, and obey, Which, with each learned nymph before, They soon explain'd away. If Chloe now wou'd have her will, Her streaming eyes prevail'd, Or if her swain prov'd cruel still, Hysterics never fail'd. But Celia scorn'd the plaintive moan, And heart-dissolving show'r; With flashing eye, and angry tone, She best maintain'd her pow'r. Yet once the mandates of his Turk Avaro durst refuse; For why? important was his work, “To register old shoes!” And does, said she, the wretch dispute My claim such clowns to rule? If Celia cannot charm a brute, She can chastise a fool. Then strait she to his closet flew, His private thoughts she tore, And from its place the poker drew, That fell'd him on the floor. Henceforth, said she, my calls regard, Own mine the stronger plea, Nor let thy vulgar cares retard The female rites of tea. Victorious sex! alike your art, And puissance we dread; For if you cannot break our heart, 'Tis plain you'll break our head. Place me, ye Gods, beneath the throne Which gentle smiles environ, And I'll submission gladly own, Without a rod of iron. On Mr. Samuel Cooke's POEMS. WRITTEN IN THE YEAR 1749. Indeed, Master Cooke! You have made such a book, As the learned in pastry admire: But other wits joke To see such a smoke Without any visible fire. What a nice bill of fare, Of whatever is rare, And approv'd by the critics of taste! Not a classical bit, Ev'ry fancy to hit, But here in due order is plac'd. Yet, for all this parade, You are but a dull blade, And your lines are all scragged, and raw; And tho' you've hack'd, and have hew'd, And have squeez'd, and have stew'd, Your forc'd-meat isn't all worth a straw. Tho' your satire you spit, 'Tisn't season'd a bit, And your puffs are as heavy as lead; Call each dish what you will, Boil, roast, hash, or grill, Yet still it is all a calve's-head. I don't mind your huffing, For you've put such vile stuff in, I protest I'm as sick as a dog; Were you leaner, or fatter, I'd not mince the matter, You're not fit to dress Æsop a frog. Then, good master Slice! Shut up shop, if your wise, And th'unwary no longer trepan; Such advice indeed is hard, And may stick in your gizzard, But digest it as well as you can. The MISTAKE. ON CAPTAIN BLUFF. 1750. Says a Gosling, almost frighten'd out of her wits, Help mother, or else I shall go into fits. I have had such a fright, I shall never recover, O! that Hawke, that you've told us of over and over. See, there, where he sits, with his terrible face, And his coat how it glitters all over with lace. With his sharp hooked nose, and his sword at his heel, How my heart it goes pit-a-pat, pray, mother, feel. Says the Goose, very gravely, Pray don't talk so wild, Those looks are as harmless as mine are, my child. And as for his sword there, so bright, and so nice, I'll be sworn 'twill hurt nothing besides frogs, and mice. Nay, prithee don't hang so about me, let loose, I tell thee he dares not say—bo to a Goose. In short there is not a more innocent fowl, Why, instead of a Hawke, look ye, child, 'tis an Owl. To a LADY, with a basket of fruit. Once of forbidden fruit the mortal taste Chang'd beauteous Eden to a dreary waste. Here you may freely eat, secure the while From latent poison, or insidious guile. Yet O! cou'd I but happily infuse Some secret charm into the sav'ry juice, Of pow'r to tempt your gentle breast to share With me the peaceful cot, and rural fare: A diff'rent fate shou'd crown the blest device, And change my Desart to a Paradise. Was the late Lord Willoughey de Broke.PEYTOE's GHOST. To Craven's health, and social joy, The festive night was kept, While mirth and patriot spirit flow'd, And Dullness only slept. When from the jovial crowd I stole, And homeward shap'd my way; And pass'd along by Chesterton, All at the close of day. The sky with clouds was over-cast: An hollow tempest blow'd, And rains and foaming cataracts Had delug'd all the road. When thro' the dark and lonesome shade, Shone forth a sudden light; And soon distinct an human form, Engag'd my wondering sight. Onward it mov'd with graceful port, And soon o'ertook my speed; Then thrice I lifted up my hands, And thrice I check'd my steed. Who art thou, passenger, it cry'd, From yonder mirth retir'd? That here pursu'st thy cheerless way, Benighted, and be-mir'd. I am, said I, a country clerk, A clerk of low degree, And yonder gay and gallant scene, Suits not a curacy. But I have seen such sights to-day, As make my heart full glad, Altho' it is but dark, 'tis true, And eke—my road is bad. For I have seen lords, knights, and squires, Of great and high renown, To chuse a knight for this fair shire, All met at Warwick Town. A wight of skill to ken our laws, Of courage to defend, Of worth to serve the public cause, Before a private end. And such they found, if right I guess— Of gentle blood he came; Of morals firm, of manners mild, And Hon. William Craven, of Wykin; he was afterwards Lord Craven. Craven is his name. Did half the British tribunes share Experienc'd The late Sir Charles Mordaunt, Bart. Mordaunt's truth, Another half, like Craven, boast A free unbiass'd youth: The sun I trow, in all his race, No happier realm should find; Nor Britons hope for aught in vain, From warmth with prudence join'd. “Go on, my Country, favour'd soil, Such Patriots to produce! Go on, my Countrymen, he cry'd, Such Patriots still to chuse.” This said, the placid form retir'd, Behind the veil of night; Yet bade me, for my Country's good, The solemn tale recite. To a LADY, Furnishing her LIBRARY, at ?, in Warwickshire. When just proportion in each part, And colours mixt with nicest art, Conspire to shew the grace and mien Of Cloe, or the Cyprian Queen: With elegance throughout refin'd, That speaks the passions of the mind, The glowing canvas will proclaim, A Raphael's, or a Titian's name. So where thro' ev'ry learned page, Each distant clime, each distant age Display a rich variety, Of wisdom in epitome; Such elegance and taste will tell The hand, that could select so well. But when we all their beauties view, United and improv'd by You, We needs must own an emblem faint, T'express those charms no art can paint. Books must, with such correctness writ, Refine another's taste and wit; 'Tis to your merit only due, That theirs can be refin'd by You. To WILLIAM SHENSTONE, Esq. on receiving a gilt pocket-book. 1751. These spotless leaves, this neat array, Might well invite your charming quill, In fair assemblage to display The power of Learning, Wit, and Skill. But since you carelessly refuse, And to my pen the task assign; O! let your Genius guide my Muse, And every vulgar thought refine. Teach me your best, your best lov'd art, With frugal care to store my mind; In this to play the Miser's part, And give mean lucre to the wind: To shun the Coxcomb's empty noise, To scorn the Villain's artful mask; Nor trust gay Pleasure's fleeting joys Nor urge Ambition's endless task. Teach me to stem Youth's boisterous tide, To regulate its giddy rage; By Reason's aid my barque to guide, Into the friendly port of Age: To share what Classic Culture yields, Thro' Rhetoric's painted meads to roam; With you to reap historic fields, And bring the golden Harvest home. To taste the genuine sweets of Wit; To quaff in Humour's sprightly bowl; The philosophic mean to hit, And prize the Dignity of Soul. Teach me to read fair Nature's book, Wide opening in each flow'ry plain; And with judicious eye to look On all the glories of her reign. To hail her, seated on her throne, By aweful woods encompass'd round, Or her divine extraction own, Tho' with a wreath of rushes crown'd. Thro' arched walks, o'er spreading lawns, Near solemn rocks, with her to rove; Or court her, 'mid her gentle fawns, In mossy cell, or maple grove. Whether the prospect strain the sight, Or in the nearer landskips charm, Where hills, vales, fountains, woods unite, To grace your sweet Arcadian farm: There let me sit, and gaze with you, On Nature's works by Art refin'd; And own, while we their contest view, Both fair, but fairest, thus combin'd! An ELEGY on MAN. WRITTEN JANUARY 1752. Behold Earth's Lord, imperial Man, In ripen'd vigour gay; His outward form attentive scan, And all within survey. Behold his plans of future life, His care, his hope, his love, Relations dear of child, and wife, The dome, the lawn, the grove. Now see within his active mind, More gen'rous passions share, Friend, neighbour, country, all his kind, By turns engage his care. Behold him range with curious eye, O'er Earth from pole to pole, And thro' th'illimitable sky Explore with daring soul. Yet pass some twenty fleeting years, And all his glory flies, His languid eye is bath'd in tears, He sickens, groans, and dies. And is this all his destin'd lot, This all his boasted sway? For ever now to be forgot, Amid the mould'ring clay! Ah gloomy thought! ah worse than death! Life sickens at the sound; Better it were not draw our breath, Than run this empty round. Hence, cheating Fancy, then, away O let us better try, By Reason's more enlighten'd ray, What 'tis indeed to die. Observe yon mass of putrid earth, It holds an embryo-brood, Ev'n now the reptiles crawl to birth, And seek their leafy food. Yet stay 'till some few suns are past, Each forms a silken tomb, And seems, like man, imprison'd fast, To meet his final doom. Yet from this silent mansion too Anon you see him rise, No more a crawling worm to view, But tenant of the skies. And what forbids that man should share, Some more auspicious day, To range at large in open air, As light and free as they? There was a time when life first warm'd Our flesh in shades of night, Then was th'imperfect substance form'd, And sent to view this light. There was a time, when ev'ry sense In straiter limits dwelt, Yet each its task cou'd then dispense, We saw, we heard, we felt. And times there are, when thro' the veins The blood forgets to flow, Yet then a living pow'r remains, Tho' not in active show. Times too there be, when friendly Sleep's Soft charms the Senses bind, Yet Fancy then her vigils keeps, And ranges unconfin'd. And Reason holds her sep'rate sway, Tho' all the Senses wake, And forms in Mem'ry's storehouse play, Of no material make. What are these then, this eye, this ear, But nicer organs found, A glass to read, a trump to hear, The modes of shape, or sound? And blows may maim, or time impair These instruments of clay, And Death may ravish what they spare, Compleating their decay. But are these then that living Pow'r That thinks, compares, and rules? Then say a scaffold is a tow'r, A workman is his tools. For aught appears that Death can do, That still survives his stroke, Its workings plac'd beyond our view, Its present commerce broke. But what connections it may find, Vid. Butler's Analogy.Boots much to hope, and fear, And if Instruction courts the mind, 'Tis madness not to hear. On receiving a little IVORY BOX from a lady, curiously wrought by her own hands. Little Box of matchless grace! Fairer than the fairest face, Smooth as was her parent-hand, That did thy wond'rous form command. Spotless as her infant mind, As her riper age refin'd, Beauty with the Graces join'd. Let me clothe the lovely stranger, Let me lodge thee safe from danger. Let me guard thy soft repose, From giddy Fortune's random blows. From thoughtless mirth, barbaric hate, From the iron-hand of Fate, And Oppression's deadly weight. Thou art not of a sort, or number Fashion'd for a Poet's lumber; Tho' more capacious than his purse, Too small to hold his store of verse. Too delicate for homely toil, Too neat for vulgar hands to soil. O! wou'd the Fates permit the Muse, Thy future destiny to chuse! In thy circle's fairy round, With a golden fillet bound: Like the snow-drop silver white, Like the glow-worm's humid light, Like the dew at early dawn, Like the moon-light on the lawn, Lucid rows of pearls shou'd dwell, Pleas'd as in their native shell; Or the brilliant's sparkling rays, Shou'd emit a starry blaze. And if the Fair whose magic skill, Wrought thee passive to her will, Deign to regard thy Poet's love, Nor his aspiring suit reprove, Her form should crown the fair design, Goddess fit for such a shrine! VALENTINE's DAY. The tuneful choir in amorous strains, Accost their feather'd loves; While each fond mate with equal pains, The tender suit approves. With chearful hop from spray to spray, They sport along the meads; In social bliss together stray, Where love or fancy leads. Thro' Spring's gay scenes each happy pair Their fluttering joys pursue; Its various charms and produce share, For ever kind and true. Their sprightly notes from every shade, Their mutual loves proclaim; Till Winter's chilling blasts invade, And damp th'enlivening flame. Then all the jocund scene declines, Nor woods nor meads delight; The drooping tribe in secret pines, And mourns th'unwelcome sight. Go, blissful warblers! timely wise, Th'instructive moral tell! Nor thou their meaning lays despise, My charming Annabelle! HAMLET's SOLILOQUY, IMITATED. To print, or not to print—that is the question. Whether 'tis better in a trunk to bury The quirks and crotchets of outrageous fancy, Or send a well-wrote copy to the press, And by disclosing, end them? To print, to doubt No more; and by one act to say we end The head-ach, and a thousand natural shocks Of scribbling frenzy—'tis a consummation Devoutly to be wish'd. To print—to beam From the same shelf with Pope, in calf well bound: To sleep, perchance, with Quarles—Ay, there's the rub— For to what class a writer may be doom'd, When he hath shuffled off some paltry stuff, Must give us pause.—There's the respect that makes Th'unwilling poet keep his piece nine years. For who wou'd bear th'impatient thirst of fame, The pride of conscious merit, and 'bove all, The tedious importunity of friends, When as himself might his quietus make With a bare inkhorn? Who would fardles bear? To groan and sweat under a load of wit? But that the tread of steep Parnassus' hill, That undiscover'd country, with whose bays Few travellers return, puzzles the will, And makes us rather bear to live unknown, Than run the hazard to be known, and damn'd. Thus Critics do make cowards of us all. And thus the healthful face of many a poem, Is sickly'd o'er with a pale manuscript; And enterprizers of great fire, and spirit, With this regard from Dodsley turn away, And lose the name of authors. ROUNDELAY, WRITTEN FOR THE JUBILEE AT STRATFORD UPON AVON, CELEBRATED BY MR. GARRICK IN HONOUR OF SHAKESPEARE, SEPTEMBER 1769.Set to Music by Mr. Dibdin. I Sisters of the tuneful train, Attend your Parent's jocund strain, 'Tis Fancy calls you; follow me To celebrate the Jubilee. II On Avon's banks, where Shakespeare's bust Points out, and guards his sleeping dust; The sons of scenic mirth agree, To celebrate the Jubilee. III Come, daughters, come, and bring with you Th'aerial Sprites and Fairy crew, And the sister Graces three, To celebrate the Jubilee. IV Hang around the sculptur'd tomb The 'broider'd vest, the nodding plume, And the mask of comic glee, To celebrate the Jubilee. V From Birnam Wood, and Bosworth Field, Bring the standard, bring the shield, With drums, and martial symphony, To celebrate the Jubilee. VI In mournful numbers now relate Poor Desdemona's hapless fate, With frantic deeds of jealousy, To celebrate the Jubilee. VII Nor be Windsor's Wives forgot, With their harmless merry plot, The whitening mead, and haunted tree, To celebrate the Jubilee. VIII Now in jocund strains recite The humours of the braggard Knight, Fat Knight, and Ancient Pistol he, To celebrate the Jubilee. IX But see in crowds the Gay, the Fair, To the splendid scene repair, A scene as fine, as fine can be, To celebrate the Jubilee. The BLACKBIRDS. An ELEGY. The Sun had chas'd the mountain-snow, His beams had pierc'd the stubborn soil, The melting streams began to flow, And Plowmen urg'd their annual toil. 'Twas then, amidst the vocal throng, Whom Nature wak'd to mirth, and love, A Blackbird rais'd his am'rous song, And thus it echo'd thro' the grove. O fairest of the feather'd train! For whom I sing, for whom I burn, Attend with pity to my strain, And grant my love a kind return. For see, the wint'ry storms are flown, And zephyrs gently fan the air; Let us the genial influence own, Let us the vernal pastime share. The Raven plumes his jetty wing, To please his croaking paramour, The Larks responsive carols sing, And tell their passion as they soar: But does the Raven's sable wing Excel the glossy jet of mine? Or can the Lark more sweetly sing, Than we, who strength with softness join? O let me then thy steps attend! I'll point new treasures to thy sight: Whether the grove thy wish befriend, Or hedge-rows green, or meadows bright. I'll guide thee to the clearest rill, Whose streams among the pebbles stray; There will we sip, and sip our fill, Or on the flow'ry margin play. I'll lead thee to the thickest brake, Impervious to the school-boy's eye; For thee the plaister'd nest I'll make, And to thy downy bosom fly. When, prompted by a mother's care, Thy warmth shall form th'imprison'd young, The pleasing task I'll gladly share, Or cheer thy labours with a song. To bring thee food I'll range the fields, And cull the best of ev'ry kind, Whatever Nature's bounty yields, And love's assiduous care can find. And when my lovely mate wou'd stray, To taste the summer sweets at large, I'll wait at home the live-long day, And fondly tend our little charge. Then prove with me the sweets of love, With me divide the cares of life, No bush shall boast in all the grove, A mate so fond, so blest a wife. He ceas'd his song—the plumy dame Heard with delight the love-sick strain, Nor long conceal'd a mutual flame, Nor long repress'd his am'rous pain. He led her to the nuptial bow'r, And perch'd with triumph by her side; What gilded roof cou'd boast that hour A fonder mate, or happier bride? Next morn he wak'd her with a song, Behold, he said, the new-born day, The Lark his mattin-peal has rung, Arise, my love, and come away. Together thro' the fields they stray'd, And to the murm'ring riv'let's side, Renew'd their vows, and hopp'd, and play'd With artless joy, and decent pride. When O! with grief my Muse relates What dire misfortune clos'd the tale, Sent by an order from the Fates, A Gunner met them in the vale. Alarm'd, the lover cried, My dear, Haste, haste away, from danger fly; Here, Gunner, point thy thunder here, O spare my love, and let me die. At him the Gunner took his aim, Too sure the volley'd thunder flew! O had he chose some other game, Or shot—as he was wont to do! Divided Pair! forgive the wrong, While I with tears your fate rehearse, I'll join the Widow's plaintive song, And save the Lover in my verse. The GOLDFINCHES. An ELEGY. TO WILLIAM SHENSTONE, ESQ. Ingenuas didicisse fideliter artes Emollit mores, nec sinit esse feros. To you, whose groves protect the feather'd choirs, Who lend their artless notes a willing ear, To you, whom Pity moves, and Taste inspires, The Doric strain belongs, O Shenstone hear. 'Twas gentle Spring, when all the plumy race, By Nature taught in nuptial leagues combine, A Goldfinch joy'd to meet the warm embrace, And with her mate in Love's delights to join. All in a garden, on a currant-bush, With wond'rous art they built their airy seat; In the next orchard liv'd a friendly Thrush, Nor distant far a Woodlark's soft retreat. Here blest with ease, and in each other blest, With early songs they wak'd the neighb'ring groves, Till time matur'd their joys, and crown'd their nest With infant pledges of their faithful loves. And now what transport glow'd in either's eye? What equal fondness dealt th'allotted food? What joy each other's likeness to descry, And future sonnets in the chirping brood! But ah! what earthly happiness can last? How does the fairest purpose often fail? A truant schoolboy's wantonness cou'd blast Their flatt'ring hopes, and leave them both to wail. The most ungentle of his tribe was he, No gen'rous precept ever touch'd his heart, With concord false, and hideous prosody He scrawl'd his task, and blunder'd o'er his part. On mischief bent, he mark'd, with rav'nous eyes, Where wrapt in down the callow songsters lay, Then rushing, rudely seiz'd the glitt'ring prize, And bore it in his impious hands away! But how shall I describe, in numbers rude, The pangs for poor Chrysomitris decreed, When from her secret stand aghast she view'd The cruel spoiler perpetrate the deed? O grief of griefs! with shrieking voice she cried, What sight is this that I have liv'd to see! O! that I had in Youth's fair season died, From Love's false joys, and bitter sorrows free. Was it for this, alas! with weary bill, Was it for this I pois'd th'unwieldy straw? For this I bore the moss from yonder hill, Nor shun'd the pond'rous stick along to draw? Was it for this I pick'd the wool with care, Intent with nicer skill our work to crown? For this, with pain, I bent the stubborn hair, And lin'd our cradle with the thistle's down? Was it for this my freedom I resign'd, And ceas'd to rove at large from plain to plain? For this I sate at home whole days confin'd, To bear the scorching heat, and pealing rain? Was it for this my watchful eyes grow dim? For this the roses on my cheek turn pale? Pale is my golden plumage, once so trim! And all my wonted mirth, and spirits fail! O Plund'rer vile! O more than Adders fell! More murth'rous than the Cat, with prudish face! Fiercer than Kites in whom the Furies dwell, And thievish as the Cuckow's pilf'ring race! May juicy plumbs for thee forbear to grow, For thee no flow'r unveil its charming dies; May birch-trees thrive to work thee sharper woe, And list'ning starlings mock thy frantic cries. Thus sang the mournful bird her piteous tale, The piteous tale her mournful mate return'd, Then side by side they sought the distant vale, And there in secret sadness inly mourn'd. The SWALLOWS: An ELEGY. PART I. Ere yellow Autumn from our plains retir'd, And gave to wintry storms the varied year, The Swallow-race with prescient gift inspir'd, To southern climes prepar'd their course to steer. On Damon's roof a large assembly sate, His roof a refuge to the feather'd kind! With serious look he mark'd the grave debate, And to his Delia thus address'd his mind. Observe yon' twitt'ring flock, my gentle maid! Observe, and read the wond'rous ways of Heav'n! With us thro' Summer's genial reign they stay'd, And food, and sunshine to their wants were giv'n. But now, by secret instinct taught, they know The near approach of elemental strife, Of blust'ring tempests, and of chilling snow, With ev'ry pang, and scourge of tender life. Thus warn'd they meditate a speedy flight, For this ev'n now they prune their vig'rous wing, For this each other to the toil excite, And prove their strength in many a sportive ring. No sorrow loads their breast, or dims their eye, To quit their wonted haunts, or native home, Nor fear they launching on the boundless sky, In search of future settlements to roam. They feel a pow'r, an impulse all divine, That warns them hence, they feel it, and obey, To this direction all their cares resign, Unknown their destin'd stage, unmark'd their way. Peace to your flight! ye mild, domestic race! O! for your wings to travel with the sun! Health brace your nerves, and zephyrs aid your pace, Till your long voyage happily be done. See, Delia, on my roof your guests to-day, To-morrow on my roof your guests no more, Ere yet 'tis night with haste they wing away, To-morrow lands them on some happier shore. How just the moral in this scene convey'd! And what without a moral? wou'd we read! Then mark what Damon tells his gentle maid, And with his lesson register the deed. So youthful joys fly like the Summer's gale, So threats the winter of inclement age, Life's busy plot a short, fantastic tale! And Nature's changeful scenes the shifting stage! This little piece, and its companions, particularly the following, are highly honour'd by Mr. Aikin, in his ingenious and entertaining “Essay on the Application of Natural History to Poetry.”And does no friendly pow'r to man dispense The joyful tidings of some happier clime? Find we no guide in gracious Providence Beyond the gloomy grave, and short-liv'd time? Yes, yes the sacred oracles we hear, That point the path to realms of endless joy, That bid our trembling hearts no danger fear, Tho' clouds surround, and angry skies annoy. Then let us wisely for our flight prepare, Nor count this stormy world our fixt abode, Obey the call, and trust our Leader's care, To smooth the rough, and light the darksome road. Moses, by grant divine, led Israel's host Thro' dreary paths to Jordan's fruitful side; But we a loftier theme than theirs can boast, A better promise, and a nobler guide. PART II. At length the Winter's howling blasts are o'er, Array'd in smiles the lovely Spring returns, Now fewel'd hearths attractive blaze no more, And ev'ry breast with inward fervor burns. Again the daisies peep, the violets blow, Again the vocal tenants of the grove Forgot the patt'ring hail, or driving snow, Renew the lay to melody, and love. And see, my Delia, see o'er yonder stream, Where, on the bank, the lambs in gambols play, Alike attracted by the sunny gleam, Again the Swallows take their wonted way. Welcome, ye gentle tribe, your sports pursue, Welcome again to Delia, and to me, Your peaceful councils on my roof renew, And plan new settlements from danger free. Again I'll listen to your grave debates, Again I'll hear your twitt'ring songs unfold What policy directs your wand'ring states, What bounds are settled, and what tribes enroll'd. Again I'll hear you tell of distant lands, What insect-nations rise from Egypt's mud, What painted swarms subsist on Lybia's sands, What Ganges yields, and what th'Euphratean flood. Thrice happy race! whom Nature's call invites To travel o'er her realms with active wing, To taste her various stores, her best delights, The Summer's radiance, and the sweets of Spring: While we are doom'd to bear the restless change Of varying seasons, vapours dank, and dry, Forbid like you in milder climes to range, When wintry storms usurp the low'ring sky. Yet know the period to your joys assign'd, Know ruin hovers o'er this earthly ball, As lofty tow'rs stoop prostrate to the wind, Its secret props of adamant shall fall. But when yon' radiant sun shall shine no more, The spirit, freed from sin's tyrannic sway, On lighter pinions borne than yours, shall soar To fairer realms beneath a brighter ray. To plains ethereal, and celestial bow'rs, Where wintry storms no rude access obtain, Where blasts no lightning, and no tempest low'rs, But ever-smiling Spring, and Pleasure reign. THE END. ADAM: OR, THE Fatal Disobedience. AN ORATORIO. COMPILED FROM THE PARADISE LOST OF MILTON. AND ADAPTED TO MUSIC. By R. J. The Persons here represented are ADAM, and EVE; with the Guardian Angels of Paradise, and others. The Scene is Paradise. ACT I. SCENE I. RECITATIVE. Under a tuft of shade, that, on a green, Stood whisp'ring soft, on Eden's blissful plain, Sate the first human Pair. (Not that fair Field Of Enna, where Proserpine, gath'ring flow'rs, Herself, a fairer flow'r, by gloomy Dis Was gather'd; nor that sweet Elysian Grove Of Daphne by Orontes, and th'inspir'd Castalian Spring, might with this Paradise Of Eden strive: nor that Nysean Isle, Girt with the river Triton, where old Cham, Whom Gentiles Ammon call, and Lybian Jove, Hid Amalthea, and her florid son, Young Bacchus from his step-dame Rhea's eye— Nor where Abassine kings their issue guard, Mount Amara! enclos'd with shining rock, A whole day's journey high.) Around them grew All trees of noblest kind for sight, smell, taste, And all amid them grew the Tree of Life, High eminent, blooming ambrosial fruit Of vegetable gold; and, next to Life, Our Death! the Tree of Knowledge grew fast by. Here waving boughs wept od'rous gums, and balm: On others fruit, burnish'd with golden rind, Hung amiable: betwixt them lawns, and downs, Or palmy hillock, or the flow'ry lap Of some irriguous valley spread her store, Flow'rs of all hues, and without thorn the rose. Another side umbrageous grots, and caves Of cool recess! o'er which the mantling vine Lays forth her purple grape, and gently creeps Luxuriant. Mean while murm'ring waters fall Down the slope hills dispers'd, or, in a lake, That to the fringed bank, with myrtle crown'd, Her crystal mirrour holds, unite their streams. The birds their quire apply—airs, vernal airs Breathing the smell of field, or grove attune The trembling leaves, and whisper whence they stole Their balmy spoils. About them frisking play'd All beasts of th'earth, since wild, and of all chase In wood, or wilderness, forest, or den. Sporting the lion ramp'd, and, in his paw, Dandled the kid. Bears, tygers, ounces, pards Gambol'd before them. Th'unwieldy elephant, To make them mirth, us'd all his might, and wreath'd His lithe proboscis. Close the serpent sly, Insinuating, wove, with Gordian twine, His braided train, and, of his fatal guile Gave proof unheeded. They superior sate As lords of all, of God-like shape erect! For valour he, and contemplation form'd, For softness she, and sweet attractive grace! AIR. “They superior sate, “As lords of all, of God-like shape erect! “For valour he, and contemplation form'd, “For softness she, and sweet attractive grace!” SCENE II. RECITATIVE. On the soft downy bank, damaskt with flow'rs, Reclin'd they sate, when Adam first of men To first of women Eve thus smiling spake. ADAM. Sole partner, and sole part of all these joys, Dearer thyself than all! needs must the Pow'r, That made us, and, for us, this ample world, Be infinitely good, and, of his good As liberal, and free as infinite; Who rais'd us from the dust, and plac'd us here, In all this happiness; who yet requires From us no other service, than to keep This one, this easy charge—Of all the Trees In Paradise, that bear delicious fruit So various, not to taste that only Tree Of Knowledge, planted by the Tree of Life. SONG. “Then let us ever praise Him, and extol “His bounty, following our delightful task, “To prune these growing plants, and tend these flow'rs, “Which, were it toilsome, yet with thee were sweet.” RECITATIVE. EVE. O thou! for whom And from whom I was form'd! Flesh of thy flesh! And without whom am to no end! My guide, And head! what thou hast said is just, and right: For we indeed to Him all praises owe, And daily thanks: I chiefly, who enjoy So much the happier lot, enjoying thee. AFFETUOSO. “That day I oft remember, when from sleep “I first awak'd, and found myself repos'd “Under a shade of flow'rs, much wond'ring where, “And what I was, whence thither brought, and how. “Not distant far from thence, a murm'ring sound “Of waters issued from a cave, and spread “Into a liquid plain, then stood unmov'd “Pure as th'expanse of Heav'n. I thither went, “With unexperienc'd thought, and laid me down “On the green bank to look into the clear, “Smooth lake, that to me seem'd another sky. “As I bent down to look, just opposite, “A shape within the watry gleam appear'd, “Bending to look on me. I started back, “It started back. But pleas'd I soon return'd, “Pleas'd it return'd as soon, with answ'ring looks “Of sympathy, and love. There I had fix'd “Mine eyes till now, and pin'd with vain desire, “Had not a voice thus warn'd me. What thou see'st, “What there thou see'st, fair creature! is thyself. “With thee it came, and goes. But follow me, “And I will bring thee where no shadow stays “Thy coming, and thy soft embraces—He! “Whose image thou art—him thou shalt enjoy “Inseparably thine, to him shalt bear “Multitudes like thyself, and thence be call'd “Mother of human race. What cou'd I do, “But follow strait, invisibly thus led? “Till I espied thee, fair, indeed, and tall, “Under a platan. Yet methought less fair, “Less winning soft, less amiably mild, “Than that smooth watry image. Back I turn'd. “Thou following cry'dst aloud; AIR. “Return, fair Eve! “Whom fly'st thou? whom thou fly'st, of him thou art, “His flesh, his bone! To give thee being I lent “Out of my side to thee, nearest my heart, “Substantial life, to have thee by my side, “Henceforth an individual solace dear. “Part of my soul I seek thee, and thee claim “My other half.” With that thy gentle hand “Seiz'd mine; I yielded—and from that time see “How beauty is excell'd by manly grace, “And wisdom, which alone is truly fair.” RECITATIVE. So spake our gen'ral Mother, and with eyes Of conjugal affection, unreprov'd, And meek surrender, half embracing lean'd On our first Father. Half her swelling breast Naked met his, under the flowing gold Of her loose tresses hid. He, in delight Both of her beauty, and submissive charms, Smil'd with superior love, and press'd her lip With kisses pure. Thus they in am'rous sport, As well beseems fair couple, linkt as they, In happy nuptial league, their minutes pass'd, Crown'd with sublime delight. The loveliest pair That ever yet in Love's embraces met: Adam the goodliest man of men since born His sons, the fairest of her daughters Eve! CHORUS. “Hail! Hymen's first, accomplish'd Pair! “Goodliest he of all his sons! “Of her daughters she most fair! “Goodliest he! “She most fair! “Goodliest he of all his sons! “Of her daughters she most fair. SCENE III. RECITATIVE. Now came still Ev'ning on, and Twilight grey Had, in her sober liv'ry all things clad. Silence accompanied: for beast, and bird, They to their grassy couch, these to their nests Were slunk: all but the wakeful Nightingale! She all night long her am'rous descant sung. Silence was pleas'd. Now glow'd the firmament With living saphires. Hesperus, that led The starry host, rode brightest, till the Moon, Rising in clouded majesty, at length, Apparent queen! unveil'd her peerless light, And o'er the dark her silver mantle threw. When Adam thus to Eve. ADAM. Fair Consort! th'hour Of Night, and all things now retir'd to rest Mind us of like repose: since God hath set Labour, and rest as day, and night to men Successive, and the timely due of sleep, Now falling with soft slumb'rous weight, inclines Our eye-lids. Ere fresh Morning streak the east With first approach of light, we must be ris'n, And at our pleasant labour, to reform Yon' flow'ry arbours, yonder alleys green, Our walk at Noon, with branches overgrown. Mean while, as Nature wills, Night bids us rest. EVE. My author, and disposer, what thou bid'st Unargu'd I obey, so God ordains. God is thy law, thou mine. To know no more Is woman's happiest knowledge, and her praise. AIR. “With thee conversing, I forget all time. “All seasons, and their change, all please alike. “Sweet is the breath of Morn, her rising sweet, “With charm of earliest birds! Pleasant the Sun! “When first on this delightful land he spreads “His orient beams on herb, tree, fruit, and flow'r, “Glist'ring with dew: fragrant the fertile Earth, “After soft show'rs! and sweet the coming on “Of grateful Evening mild; the silent Night, “With this her solemn bird; and this fair Moon, “And those the gems of Heav'n, her starry train! “But neither breath of Morn, when she ascends, “With charm of earliest birds, nor rising Sun “On this delightful land, nor herb, fruit, flow'r, “Glist'ring with dew, nor fragrance after show'rs, “Nor grateful Evening mild, nor silent Night, “With this her solemn bird, nor walk by Moon, “Or glitt'ring star-light without thee is sweet.” RECITATIVE. Thus talking, hand in hand, alone they pass'd On to their blissful bow'r. It was a place, Chos'n by the Sov'reign Planter, when he fram'd All things to man's delightful use; the roof, Of thickest covert, was in-woven shade, Laurel, and myrtle, and what higher grew Of firm, and fragrant leaf; on either side, Acanthus, and each od'rous, bushy shrub Fenc'd up the verdant wall, each beauteous flow'r, Iris, all hues, roses, and jessamine Rear'd high their flourish'd heads between, and wrought Mosaic; under foot the violet, Crocus, and hyacinth, with rich inlay, Broider'd the ground, more colour'd than with stone Of costliest emblem. Other creature here Beast, bird, insect, or worm, durst enter none, Such was their awe of Man. In shady bow'r, More sacred, and sequester'd; tho' but feign'd, Pan, or Sylvanus never slept, nor Nymph, Or Faunus haunted. Here, in close recess, With flow'rs, and garlands, and sweet smelling herbs Espoused Eve deck'd first her nuptial bed, And heav'nly quires the Hymenæan sung. Thus at their shady lodge arriv'd, both stood, Both turn'd, and, under open Sky, ador'd The God that made both Sky, Air, Earth, and Heav'n, Which they beheld, the Moon's resplendent globe, And starry pole. EVENING HYMN. “Thou also mad'st the night, “Maker omnipotent! and Thou the day, “Which we, in our appointed work employ'd, “Have finish'd, happy in our mutual help, “And mutual love, the crown of all our bliss; “Ordain'd by Thee, and this delicious place, “For us too large, where Thy abundance wants “Partakers, and uncropt falls to the ground. “But Thou hast promis'd from us two a race, “To fill the earth, who shall, with us, extol “Thy goodness infinite, both when we wake, “And when we seek, as now, thy gift of Sleep. END OF THE FIRST ACT. ACT II. SCENE I. RECITATIVE. O! for that warning voice, which he, who saw Th'Apocalyps, heard cry in Heav'n aloud, Then when the Dragon, put to second rout, Came furious down, to be reveng'd on men, Woe to th'inhabitants of th'earth! that now, While time was, our first Parents had been warn'd The coming of their secret foe, and scap'd, Haply so scap'd his mortal snare; for now Satan, now first inflam'd with rage, came down, The tempter, ere th'accuser of mankind. CHORUS. He, who sits enthron'd on high, Above the circle of the sky, Sees his rage, and mocks his toil, Which on himself shall soon recoil: In the snare, with malice, wrought For others, shall his feet be caught. SCENE II. RECITATIVE. Now Morn her rosy steps in th'eastern clime Advancing, sow'd the earth with orient pearl, When Adam wak'd, so custom'd, for his sleep Was airy light, from pure digestion bred, And temp'rate vapours bland, which th'only sound Of leaves, and fuming rills, Aurora's fan, Lightly dispers'd, and the shrill matin song Of birds on ev'ry bough. Unwaken'd Eve Close at his side, in naked beauty lay, Beauty! which, whether waking, or asleep, Shot forth peculiar charms. He, on his side, Leaning, half rais'd, with looks of cordial love Hung over her enamour'd: then, with voice, Mild as when Zephyrus on Flora breathes, Her hand soft-touching, whisper'd thus. SONG. “Awake! “My fairest, my espous'd, my latest found, “Heav'n's last, best gift, my ever newdelight, “Awake! the morning shines, and the fresh field “Calls us; we lose the prime, to mark how spring “Our tended plants, how blows the citron grove, “What drops the myrrh, and what the balmy reed; “How Nature paints her colours; how the bee “Sits on the bloom, extracting liquid sweets.” RECITATIVE. EVE. Adam! well may we labour still to dress This garden, still to tend, herb, plant, and flow'r, Our pleasant task enjoin'd! but till more hands Aid us, the work under our labour grows Luxurious by restraint. Let us divide Our labours then, for while together thus Our task we choose, what wonder if so near Looks intervene, and smiles, or object new Casual discourse draw on, which intermits Our day's work, brought to little, though begun Early, and th'hour of supper comes unearn'd. ADAM. These paths, and bow'rs doubt not but our joint hands Will keep from wilderness with ease as wide As we need walk, till younger hands ere long Assist us. But if much converse perhaps Thee satiate, to short absence I cou'd yield, For solitude sometimes is best society, And short retirement urges sweet return. But other doubt possesses me, lest harm Befal thee sever'd from me; for thou know'st What hath been warn'd us, what malicious foe, Envying our happiness, and of his own Despairing, seeks to work us woe, and shame, By sly assault; and somewhere, nigh at hand, Watches no doubt, with greedy hope, to find His wish, and best advantage! us asunder; Hopeless to circumvent us join'd, where each To other speedy aid might lend at need. Then leave not, I advise, the faithful side Which gave thee being, shades thee, and protects. AIR. “The wife, where danger, or dishonour lurks, “Safest, and seemliest near her husband stays, “Who guards her, or with her the worst endures.” RECITATIVE. EVE. Offspring of Heav'n, and Earth, and all Earth's Lord! That such an enemy we have, who seeks Our ruin, oft inform'd by thee, I learn. But that thou shou'dst my firmness therefore doubt, To God, or thee, because we have a foe May tempt it, I expected not to hear. ADAM. Daughter of God, and man, immortal Eve! For such thou art, from sin, and blame entire: Not diffident of thee, do I dissuade Thy absence from my sight, but to avoid Th'attempt, which thou thyself with virtuous scorn And anger wou'd'st resent. Misdeem not then, If such affront I labour to avert From thee alone, which on us both at once The enemy, tho' bold, will hardly dare, Or daring, first on me th'assault shall light. Nor thou his malice, and false guile contemn. Subtle he needs must be, who cou'd seduce Angels; nor think superfluous others aid. “I, from the influence of thy looks, receive “Access in ev'ry virtue; in thy sight, “More wise, more watchful, stronger, if need were, “Of outward strength; while shame, thou looking on, “Shame to be overcome, or over-reach'd! “Wou'd utmost vigour raise, and rais'd unite.” Why shou'd'st not thou like sense within thee feel, When I am present, and thy trial chuse With me, best witness of thy virtue tried? EVE. If this be our condition, thus to dwell In narrow circuit, straiten'd by a foe, Subtle, or violent, we not endued, Single, with like defence, wherever met, How are we happy, still in fear of harm? AIR. “Frail is our happiness, if this be so, “And Eden were no Eden thus expos'd.” RECITATIVE. ADAM. O woman! best are all things, as the will Of God ordain'd them. His creating hand Nothing imperfect, or deficient left Of all that he created, much less Man, Or aught that might his happy state secure: Secure from outward force. Within himself The danger lies, yet lies within his pow'r. Against his will he can receive no harm; But God left free the will, for what obeys Reason is free, and reason he made right, And bid her still beware, and still erect, Lest by some fair, appearing good surpriz'd, She dictate false, and misinform the will To do what God expressly hath forbid. Not then mistrust, but tender love enjoins That I shou'd mind thee oft, and mind thou me, Firm we subsist, yet possible to swerve. AIR. “But if thou think'st trial unsought may find “Us both securer, than thus warn'd thou seem'st, “Go! for thy stay, not free, absents thee more. “Go in thy native innocence. Rely “On what thou hast of virtue: summon all, “For God towards thee hath done his part, do thine.” SCENE III. RECITATIVE. So haste they to the field, their pleasing task! But first, from under shady, arb'rous roof, Soon as they forth were come to open sight Of day-spring, and the Sun, who scarce upris'n, With wheels yet hov'ring o'er the ocean brim, Shot parallel to th'earth his dewy ray, Discov'ring, in wide circuit, all the bounds Of Paradise, and Eden's happy plains, Lowly they bow'd adoring, and began Their orisons, each morning duly paid, In various style: for neither various style Nor holy rapture wanted they to praise Their Maker in fit strains, pronounc'd, or sung, Unmeditated; such prompt eloquence Flow'd from their lips, in prose, or num'rous verse, More tuneable than needed lute, or harp To add more sweetness: and they thus began. MORNING HYMN. “These are Thy glorious works, Parent of good, “Almighty! Thine this universal frame! “Thus wond'rous fair! Thyself how wond'rous then! “Unspeakable! who sit'st above these heav'ns, “To us invisible; or dimly seen “In these Thy lowest works: yet these declare “Thy goodness beyond thought, and pow'r divine. “Speak ye, who best can tell, ye sons of light! “Angels, for ye behold Him, and, with songs, “And choral symphonies day without night, “Circle His throne rejoicing; ye in heav'n, “On earth join all ye creatures to extol “Him first, Him last, Him midst, and without end. “Fairest of Stars, last in the train of night, “If better thou belong not to the dawn, “Sure pledge of day! that crown'st the smiling morn “With thy bright circlet, praise Him in thy sphere, “While day arises, that sweet hour of prime. “Thou Sun, both eye, and soul of this great world! “Acknowledge Him thy greater, sound His praise “In thy eternal course, both when thou climb'st, “And when high noon hast gain'd, and when hast fall'n. “Moon! that now meet'st the orient Sun, now fly'st “With the fixt stars, fixt in their orb that flies, “And ye five other wand'ring fires, that move “In mystic dance, not without song, resound “His praise, who out of darkness call'd up light. “Air! and ye Elements, the eldest birth “Of Nature's womb, that, in quaternion, run “Perpetual circle multiform, and mix, “And nourish all things, let your ceaseless change “Vary to your great Maker still new praise. “Ye Mists, and Exhalations that now rise, “From hill, or steaming lake, dusky, or grey, “Till the Sun paint your fleecy skirts with gold, “In honour to the world's great Maker rise, “Whether to deck with clouds th'uncolour'd sky, “Or wet the thirsty earth with falling show'rs, “Rising, or falling still advance His praise. “His praise, ye Winds, that from four quarters blow, “Breathe soft, or loud; and wave your tops, ye pines, “With ev'ry plant, in sign of honour wave. “Fountains! and ye that warble, as ye flow, “Melodious murmurs, warbling tune His praise. “Join voices, all ye living souls! ye birds! “That singing, up to Heav'n's bright gates ascend, “Bear on your wings, and in your notes His praise. “Ye that in waters glide, and ye that walk “The earth; and stately tread, or lowly creep, “Witness if I be silent morn, or ev'n, “To hill, or valley, fountain, or fresh shade “Made vocal by my song, and taught His praise. “Hail, universal Lord! be bounteous still “To give us only good; and, if the night “Have gather'd aught of evil, or conceal'd, “Disperse it, as now light dispels the dark.” RECITATIVE. So pray'd they innocent; then to their task They diff'rent ways repair—he, where his choice Leads him, or where most needs, whether to wind The woodbine round his arbour, or direct The clasping ivy where to twine; while she In yonder spring of roses, intermixt With myrtle, seeks what to redress till noon. Her long, with ardent look, his eye pursu'd Delighted, but desiring more her stay. She, like a wood-nymph light of Delia's train, Betook her to the groves, but Delia's self In gait surpass'd, and goddess-like deport. Grace was in all her steps, Heav'n in her eye; In ev'ry gesture dignity, and love. AIR. “Grace was in all her steps, Heav'n in her eye; “In ev'ry gesture dignity, and love.” END OF ACT THE SECOND. ACT III. SCENE I. The GUARDIAN ANGELS. RECITATIVE. Our charge, tho' unsuccessful, is fulfill'd. The Tempter hath prevail'd, and Man is fall'n. Earth felt the wound, and Nature, from her seat Sighing thro' all her works, gave signs of woe, That all was lost. The fatal omens reach'd Our glitt'ring files, and thro' th'angelic guard Spread sadness, mixt with pity, not with guilt, Or conscious negligence. After short pause, Earth trembled from her entrails, as again In pangs, and Nature gave a second groan; Sky lower'd, and, mutt'ring thunder, some sad drops Wept at compleating of the mortal sin. Now up to Heav'n we haste, before the throne Supreme, t'approve our faithful vigilance. CHORUS. “Righteous art thou, O Lord! and just are thy judgments. “HALLELUJAH!” RECITATIVE. But see! with visage discompos'd, and dim'd With passions foul, like this late azure clime With clouds, and storms o'ercast, the human pair Bend hitherward their steps disconsolate. SCENE II. ADAM, and EVE. RECITATIVE. ADAM. O Eve! in evil hour thou didst give ear To that false worm, of whomsoever taught To counterfeit man's voice, true in our fall, False in our promis'd rising, since our eyes Open'd we find indeed, and find we know Both good and evil, good lost, and evil got, Bad fruit of knowledge! AIR. “How shall I behold “Henceforth or God, or angel, erst with joy, “And rapture oft beheld? O! might I here “In solitude live savage, in some glade “Obscur'd, where highest woods, impenetrable “To star, or sun-light, spread their umbrage broad, “And brown as evening. Cover me, ye pines, “Ye cedars, with innumerable boughs “Hide me, where I may never see them more.” RECITATIVE. Wou'd thou had'st hearken'd to my words, and stay'd With me, as I besought thee, when that strange Desire of wand'ring, this unhappy morn, I know not whence possess'd thee! we had then Remain'd still happy; not as now despoil'd Of all our good, shamed, naked, mis'rable! AIR. “Let none henceforth seek needless cause t'approve “The faith they owe; when earnestly they seek “Such proof, conclude they then begin to fail.” EVE. Imput'st thou that to my desire, or will Of wand'ring, as thou call'st it, which who knows But might as ill have happen'd thou being by, Or to thyself perhaps, had'st thou been there? “Was I t'have never parted from thy side, “As good have grown there still a lifeless rib. “Being as I am, why did'st not thou, the head, “Command me absolutely not to go, “Going into such danger as thou said'st.” Too facil then, thou did'st not much gainsay, Nay, did'st permit, approve, and fair dismiss. Had'st thou been firm, and fix'd in thy dissent, Neither had I transgress'd, nor thou with me. ADAM. AIR. “Thus it shall befall “Him, who to worth in woman overtrusting, “Lets her will rule; restraint she will not brook, “And left t'herself, if evil thence ensue, “She first his weak indulgence will accuse.” SCENE III. RECITATIVE. ADAM. O mis'rable of happy! Is this the end Of this new glorious world, and me so late The glory of that glory? who now become Accurst of blessed! Hide me from the face Of God, whom to behold was then my height Of happiness. Yet well, if here wou'd end The mis'ry; I deserv'd it, and wou'd bear My own deservings; but this will not serve. All that I eat, or drink, or shall beget, Is propagated curse. O voice once heard Delightfully, “Increase, and multiply.” Now death to hear! For what can I increase, Or multiply but curses on my head, Heavy! though in their place? O fleeting joys Of Paradise, dear bought with lasting woe! “Did I request thee, Maker! from my clay, “To mould me man? Did I solicit thee “From darkness to promote me, or to place “In this delicious garden? As my will “Concurr'd not to my being, 'twere but right “And equal to reduce me to my dust, “Desirous to resign, and render back “All I receiv'd.” EVE. O Adam! can I thus behold thee wretched, Thus mis'rable thro' my default, nor strive To sooth thy grief, and soften thy distress? ADAM. Out of my sight, thou serpent! that name best Befits thee, with him leagu'd, thyself as false, And hateful!— —But for thee, I had continued happy, had not thy pride, And wand'ring vanity, when least was safe, Rejected my forewarning, and disdain'd Not to be trusted; longing to be seen, Tho' by the Devil himself. AIR. “O! why did God, “Creator wise! that peopled highest Heav'n “With spirits masculine, create at last “This novelty on earth, this fair defect “Of Nature! and not fill the world at once “With men, as angels without feminine?” EVE. Forsake me not thus, Adam! Witness Heav'n! What love sincere, and rev'rence in my heart I bear thee, and unweeting have offended, Unhappily deceiv'd! Thy supplicant I beg, and clasp thy knees; “Bereave me not, “Whereon I live, thy gentle looks—thy aid— “Thy counsel in this uttermost distress: “My only strength, and stay! Forlorn of thee, “Whither shall I betake me, where subsist?” While yet we live, scarce one short hour perhaps, Between us two let there be peace, both joining, As join'd in injuries, one enmity Against a foe, by doom express assign'd us, That cruel serpent. On me exercise not Thy hatred for this misery befall'n, On me already lost, me than thyself More miserable: both have sinn'd, but thou Against God only, I against God, and thee: And to the place of judgment will return, There with my cries importune Heav'n, that all The sentence, from thy head remov'd, may light On me, sole cause to thee of all this woe, Me! me! just object only of his ire. ADAM. Alas! ill able art thou to sustain His full wrath, whose thou feel'st as yet least part, And my displeasure bear'st so ill. If pray'rs Cou'd alter high decrees, I to that place Wou'd speed before thee, and be louder heard, That on my head all might be visited, Thy frailty, and infirmer sex forgiv'n, To me committed, and by me expos'd. But rise—Let us no more contend, and blame Each other, blam'd enough elsewhere, but strive In offices of love, how we may lighten Each other's burthen in our share of woe. Then to the place repairing, where our Judge Pronounc'd our doom, there let us both confess Humbly our faults, and pardon beg, with tears Wat'ring the ground, and with our sighs the air Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign Of sorrow unfeign'd, and humiliation meek. RECITATIVE ACCOMPANIED. So spake our Father penitent, nor Eve Felt less remorse. They forthwith to the place Repairing, where He judg'd them, prostrate fell Before Him reverent, and both confess'd Humbly their faults, and pardon beg'd, with tears Wat'ring the ground, and with their sighs the air Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign Of sorrow unfeign'd, and humiliation meek. SCENE IV. RECITATIVE. EVE. What tidings bring'st thou, Adam! from this new guest Angelical, so late arriv'd? Alas! My trembling heart forebodes some further ill; For far less mild methought his aspect seem'd, Than Raphael's, social spirit! who wont so oft To sit indulgent with us, and partake Rural repast, permitting us the while Venial discourse unblam'd. What tidings? say. ADAM. Our pray'rs are heard in Heav'n, and Death our due By sentence then, when first we did transgress, Is of his prey defeated many days Giv'n us of grace, wherein we may repent. So God appeas'd, from his rapacious claim Will quite redeem us, and to life restore. But longer in this Paradise to dwell, As not befitting creatures stain'd with sin, He suffers not, but sends us forth to till The ground from whence he took us, fitter soil! EVE. AIR. AFFETUOSO. “O! unexpected stroke, worse than of death! “Must I then leave thee, Paradise, thus leave “Thee, native soil! These happy walks, and shades, “Fit haunt of Gods! where I had hope to spend “Quiet, tho' sad the respite of that day, “That must be mortal to us both. O flow'rs! “That never will in other climate grow, “My early visitation, and my last “At ev'n, which I bred up with tender hand, “From the first op'ning bud, and gave you names, “Who now shall rear you to the sun, and rank “Your tribes, and water from th'ambrosial fount? “Thee lastly, nuptial bow'r! by me adorn'd “With what to sight, or smell was sweet; from thee “How shall I part, and whither wander down “Into a lower world, to this obscure, “And wild; how shall we breathe in other air “Less pure, accustom'd to immortal fruits?” ADAM. Lament not, Eve! but patiently resign What justly we have lost, nor set thine heart Thus overfond on that which is not ours. Thy going is not lonely—I will guard Thy steps from harm, and all thy wants supply. EVE. Adam! I feel within new life, new hopes By Heav'n, and thee inspir'd. Then now lead on, In me is no delay. “With thee to go, “Is to stay here. Without thee here to stay, “Is to go hence unwilling. Thou to me “Art all things under Heav'n, all places thou! “Who for my wilful crime art banish'd hence.” This further consolation yet secure I carry hence—tho' all by me is lost, Such favour I unworthy am vouchsaf'd, By me the promis'd Seed shall all restore. So spake our mother Eve. And Adam heard Well pleas'd, but answer'd not. For now too nigh The Cherubim advanc'd; and, in their front, The brandish'd sword of God before them blaz'd, Fierce as a comet, which, with torrid-heat, Smote on that clime, so late their blest abode! Some nat'ral tears they drop'd, but wip'd them soon: The world was all before them, where to chuse Their place of rest, and Providence their guide. CHORUS. ALLEGRO. “The world was all before them, where to chuse “Their place of rest, and Providence their guide.” FINIS.</field>
