      <field name="fulltext">âBenevolence is like the gen'rous sun, Whose free impartial splendour fosters all.â TO HER MAJESTY QUEEN ADELAIDE. THE OCEAN. As calm and silent as the blue serene Of Heav'ns high firmament, the Ocean spreads; The mountains smile, and all the sylvan scene Sleeps in repose; the still air fragrance sheds; The birds sit mute; the flow'rets hang their heads, As if all drowsy with the summer's heat; And the glad rills, that prattle in their beds, But hushing cadences to lull repeat; Afar the lambs that on the pastures bleat, Now more of peace than fears infantine tell, And from the steeple in the trees, how sweet, With Sabbath voice invites the holy bell, To thank the Lord: yes, all on down or fell, See man respited, free on Nature gaze, And bid awhile his tasks of toil farewell, To burn the incense of soul-mingling praise. How the great Ocean, region of amaze, Awakes the worship of my truant sight, For still methinks whate'er its width displays, Unfolds a sign of undivulged might. The boundless skies immeasurable height; The thunders rolling in their cars of gloom; The bliss of day; the starry vestured night; The dumb dark Past that dwells with Death and Doom; Yea all that prophets see in omens loom, Whate'er is wild, or wonderful, or vast, Dread as the tempest, solemn as the tomb, Type of the Lord! thou mystic Ocean hast. As in the caverns of th'unfathom'd past, Within thy caves what trophies lie unknown; As thy white billows marshall'd by the blast, Where is such energy embattled shown? Sometimes serene around thy dazzling throne, Delighted Hope invokes the ling'ring gale, While on the cliff some anxious beauteous one, Beholds with joy the bright and coming sail: Fair Hope with thee hath many a flattering tale, When summer smiles and sunny skies are blue, But they that listen oft in woe bewail, Or wreckt by storms the siren-fables rue. Safe on the mountain let me pensive view Thy silv'ry horizon's far distant sheen, And lur'd by Fancy undisturb'd pursue, The gay phantasms of the airy scene; Or by the shore on strand or margent green, Sooth'd by the fawning of the gentle wave, Entranced muse of what with thee hath been, That shipmen dar'd, the dangers of the brave; Or in some rocky nich or beetling cave, Sit dark alone and hear the tempest sweep, While hoarse thy fierce impassion'd breakers rave, Rous'd by the winds that madly vex the deep At dead of night, when conscious widows weep, Though yet untold the loss their hearts deplore, Of those they lov'd, flung to the ruthless steep, By raging surges of an iron shore;â Then in the speculum of Fancy low'r, Portentous visions, and the thrilling mind, Discerns the myst'ries of thy awful pow'r,â The real fictions fated seamen find. When drifting rudderless before the wind, They see aloft the sun, God's lidless eye, Still bright upon them, and a form design'd Of Providence in the embracing sky, Whose universal arms unceasingly, Infold all things, by the Almighty made, Since the beginning of eternity, Or is in space, his realm, his all-survey'd! Nor does the visible assurance fade Even from the sea-boy, who alone survives The founder'd barkâlo! where still unafraid For mast or spar he hopeful swimming strives! Or when, last left by lot, he famish'd, drives O'er thy lone waste before the nameless gale, And from the billows hoar ahead, descries, The pray'd for vision of a rising sail. Oh righteous Heav'n! it is of no avail To grant the boonâthe hope of rescue dies And he must perish with his tragic tale, âUnseen his signals and unheard his cries.â And yet not o'er the ocean always flies The greedy raven, gorging loathsome food, For sometimes there the white-wing'd dove supplies, Heart-cheering signals from the shoreless flood. When low and sad the daunted mourn subdued, And fearful see but hideous portents frown, Oft dawns the radiance of ensuing good, And freshen'd hopes rebudding blossoms own. Thus the adventurer to shores unknown, Look'd o'er the waves undaunted for the light, And as a star that long in darkness shone, He issued sparkling from the depths of night.â Still as the dead, array'd in ghastly white, The frozen landscape in the silence lay: Around him with their ineffectual light, The lamps of Heaven like funeral tapers ray.â Black-mantl'd oft the cowering dubious day Peer'd from the cloud, while thy deep-troubled voice, As rumour'd dangers sounding far away, Boom'd constant thunder and mysterious noise. Yet in that time and when foregone all choice, Like him that's fetter'd, hopeless, with disease, Blest as the beams that make the eye rejoice, The bright Aurora of new hope he sees; With silv'ry sails before the vernal breeze, Beholds the ark of his salvation come, While stern despair resolves to flowing ease, And fears grow legends to enliven home.â But those that far on vague adventures roam, In pathless regions of untrodden snow, Shall vainly seek that ever-echoing dome, Which starry Fame prepares for names below. Th'intrepid warrior may exulting glow With the proud consciousness of glory won, Unfold his vest and scars as trophies show, And boast of deeds by feats of valour done; But as the iceberg feels the summer's sun, And melts away in the oblivious sea, The barren splendour of the bold shall run To dark abysses and forgotten be; Yea all, as substanceless as shadows, flee To where oblivion, the dumb god, unseen Reigns o'er the poor and rich, oh deep! as thee Like yet unlikeâa colourless sereneâ All, all must perish that hath ever been, Save the pure soul, immortal entity, And those blest germs that only Virtues glean, Those heav'nly thoughts that thrive in memory. Oh let me in that sacred labour try, Whose tasks are boons to poor sin-sullied man, And earn the recompence that's paid on high, The hire assur'd by God's eternal plan. Yes, still forever as its scope we scan, Whate'er is good evolves reward and gain; Whate'er is evil, since the world began, Begets but woes, the noxious brood of pain. Yes, even thee, thou ship-devouring Main, That oft in madness dares high dreadful heaven, May'st wisdom teach, when with too slack a rein Thy billows drive by tempests lash'd and driven. For then the being man to whom is given, A bloated heart with a discerning mind, May see that Justice holds her steelyard even, And equal tendance all the living find; In that eternal plan, of old design'd. Of one import alike are all in life, Hors'd on the yard in air, or crawling blind Beneath the sod, or in the battle's strife, Remorseless glorying with the hero's knife, Or craving alms, forsaken, lame and old, Laid in the highway, where the rich are rife, The best, the base, the braggard and the bold,â But for vain man, that doth himself infold, A worshipp'd idol in his own embrace, The scheme of providence around unroll'd Would show our humble, low, appointed place. There shines as brightâas bright an orb in space, The flickering insect of the solar beam, As he the sage whose wisdom would efface The ills that trouble Time's swift-ebbing stream. The storm may riot, and the light'ning gleam;â They serve a purpose in this world of care, And as the vision of a vexing dream, Elance the glaikes and phantoms gliding there. Finite and local, man is frailty's heir, And woe's the heritage of weakness, all But share their birthright that in suffering shareâ Will'd is the lot and fetter'd is the thrall. Yet not to him doth Heav'n unheeded call, Who views aright the linked frame of things In boundless spaceânot on this tiny ball, Immense Perfection interspheres his rings. Thus though to mortals evil ever clings, In the great round and orb of all that is, Mysterious God still to perfection brings The different atoms, and their sum is bliss. 'Twas not what man hopes for in happiness; Poor, fretful, sordid, doubtful, darkling ens, That Heav'n walk'd forth to frame the wond'rous This, But for the all that would in space be thence. Parts of a wholeâthe universe of sense, In various modes and portions and degrees,â Thron'd on eternity did God dispense Almighty power, and sow his energies,â What! shall the circumscrib'd, who deems it sees The vasty deep with all its secrets shown, And shrinks to sum the ripples of the breeze, Presume to estimate the wise Unknown. O humbling thought, that daring man must own, Rob'd in the arrogance of all his pride,â Here on the margin of the Ocean lone Beholds his littleness to woe allied! Thou mighty Sea, that spreads thy waste so wide, O'er thee, oft musing as I sit forlorn, I call to mind how with his compass guide, Metalic wisdom, is the seaman borne, Amidst thy perils, and attempts to scorn Malicious Fortuneâhis determin'd fate! In nights of hurricanes, or in the morn Before the breeze, refulgent and elate, When glorious war-ships come in all their state: Then rapt entranc'd I mingle with the war,â Some epoch fam'd from which the world will date, Such as the Nelson won at Trafalgar, When beaming bright the still ascendant star Of Britain shone above the low'ring gloom, While Heav'n was nigh and earthly king's afar. Methinks I hear the iron thunders boom, And vengeance hurling, carr'd with Death and Doom. But if perchance with soul-subduing voice, Amidst the storm dejected Pity come, Shrinking I shun destruction's crashing noise, To share the raptures of those throbbing joys That blest Columbus, first of mankind, knew, When dark a-head dim in the topaz skies, The world of refuge met his eager view. Then glows my spirit, and as virtue true, Stern valour shines, a weapon of the Lord, And deeds of blood that seem'd of guilty hue, Become the trophies of Jehovah's sword. Or pensive pond'ring of His winged word That out of darkness summon'd forth the lightâ Behold it stillâof triumph still assur'd, Blaze in the gloom of intellectual night! For still o'er thee undimming ever bright, As the blest missions of the holy speed, With soul-felt impulses, from God, his might Spreads that effulgence which the wander'd need. Nor do I question then the sect or creed The preacher ownsâenough it is to know That savage men may learn that God indeed, Vouchsafes to watch man's erring race below. For but the knowledge of our overthrow, That He is here, mind of the universe, And deals rewards for good, for evil woe, Will of itself the shades of night disperse, And the great myst'ry of salvation pierce. For all on earth afflicted mourn beneath, Sorrow and care and anguish, fell and fierce;â The snakes that in the secret bosom wreath; The direful legacies that sins bequeath; The ruing thoughts that burrow in the breast; The mental cancers that make welcome death; Worms of the soul, which after death molest,â Are awful proofs that for some place of rest Man's spirit yearns. The bliss-bestowing God More, yea much more than mortals might request, Has in the mercy of his care bestow'd. But if with those that bear the truth abroad, The light of glory brighten in their wake, What tears, oh Sea! to thy wild waters flow'd, When the black bark did first the tainted take To far Australia's undiscovered brake.â Her lonely strand and spade-unwounded waste, To which a refuge, never to forsake, The conscious innocent now freely haste. Mourning contrite, the sullen sentenc'd guest His fallen thraldom oft to thee deplor'd, And griev'd, abandon'd, felt at Nature's feast, The loath of shame and drank his drug abhor'd.â The holy moon, whose dawning beams afford Joy to the mariner, to him but gave Dismal suggestions, while at night he heard, Afar the ceaseless taunting of the wave. For then the sun in his diurnal cave, Seem'd mourning hid, for youthful honour dead, And but the dark asylum of the grave, In all the ocean was around him spread.â At last arriv'd, the isle of exiles dread, In vain to him its bowery shelter shows, Where numerous streams in verdant uplands bred, Come warbling down or mute in vales repose. Nursing the grudges of the morbid woes, That knot like tumours in the punish'd's heart, Sometimes alone at close of day he goes To dull retreats, from others far apart; There moody wand'ring dismal glades athwart, To solemn nature swears with aimless vow His hoarse revenge, or with perturbed start, Look's up to Heav'n with a reproachful brow. For in his spirit felon-fancies now Shed their grim influence, and in the wood, Stern spites for punishment, his dreams allow, As if his reason saw offence in good,â Tremendous thought! that thus the mind, embued With gouts and stains, should still remorsless sigh, Vindictive wishes to dumb Solitude, And hear but discord gride in harmony! Thy boon, sweet Innocence, far differently, Affects the bosom in the sylvan scene, For there to thee, with peace and revelry, Smiles beauteous Nature, happy and serene. The hills look pleas'd, the vallies glad and green, The waters sparkle as they nimbly play, And thou, calm Ocean, in thy glassy sheen, Mirrors the Heav'n of an unclouded day. Ah lovely scene, forever far away, The jailor Palsy, with his heavy chain, Has bound me fast and seems like Guilt to say, Why dost thou linger in this world of pain? While Frenzy kindling in my shiver'd brain, Tranc'd with the horrors of the nightmare, cries, âNot feller gnaw in that bronze demon's reign Where the accurs'd in simmering sulphur fries.â But soon awake, the ravell'd vision flies, And sooth'd again I yield to gentle sleepâ Then some witch dream beguiling magic plies And tempts me onâoh save me from that steepâ At whose far basement yon black billows leap. Trembling and wild, I sudden starting scream, And find awakening that tumultuous deep, Was but the troubled caldron of a dream. Or tossing restless at the midnight, deem I hear afar some mermaid's boding dirge, Churm'd on the shore, or when the lightning's gleam Fancy that storms careering billows urge, Onward impatient with a firey scourgeâ But these dim rev'ries do not always charm, For oft I note the chiming of the surge, And muse, oh Sea, of where thy dangers swarm; Of sinking gallies and the wild alarm Of smould'ring flames devouring in the hold, And where unseen the sculking pirates arm, Or bord'rers boated row resolv'd and bold. Thou ever changing changeless Ocean old, Visible spirit of the living earth, That ever dying never dies, unfold The hidden end and purpose of thy birth. In the beginning when an empty dearth, The rimless void did only gloom contain, Creation summon'd came resplendent forthâ Came! whence? from what abyss? Jehovah's brain, Is all we know, and man but asks in vain. For Heav'n in wisdom o'er the mystic past To all that live, and questing still complain, Hath the oblivion of thick darkness cast. Yet as a meteor, blazing on the blast, My flame-wing'd Fancy in her wild career, Flies o'er the deep, and tremblingly aghast Imagines prodigies of dread and fear. Sometimes she hovers where thy desert drear, Lies shoreless spread beneath the cloudless sky, Where peace sits calm and halcyon gales appear To fan the fumes that frequent from thee fly, As if strange fires did in thy bosom ly, With shrewd malignancy the calm to mar, And signs and omens glaring suddenly Prepar'd the seamen for aerial war. Anon she sees, but without sound or jar, The convex ocean sink to a concave, And ships behind rise rapidly afar, Cresting the ridge of the surrounding wave, As if the earthquake dug a vasty grave, Sexton of nature! for the mighty sea, To which in silence without dash or lave The waters fall; or when resounding glee Some green Atlantis with its lov'd and free, In laughing safety, hears a thunder peal Roll in its crypt, the threat of jeopardy, And sees appal'd the found'ring isle reveal Stupendous ruins, which the waves conceal With frantic claspings, while with fluttering wing, The songsters bowerless in distraction wheel, Or dropping drown, or lost to rafters cling.â Their homes are gone, there never more shall Spring, The blossom-crown'd, invite to glade or grove, Nor ever there to the young bosom bring, The whisper'd promptings of delight and love. Sometimes I think how sorrowing, as the dove Mourning her mate that can return no more, The sailor's widow eyes her home above, And sits dejected on thy rugged shore. My saddening Fancy then will oft deplore The bride's dire fate, her wedding banquet blest, Who hears the riot and tumultuous roar, Of slaves obedient to a stern behest, That come to desolate her virgin breastâ The voice of triumph shouting from the main, Seems then an echo to the brave impress'd, Mocking the rattle of the seaman's chain. Oh sin of victory, Britannia's stain, That dims her glory with a lurid hue, When shall humanity not cry in vain, And when th'avenger without guilt subdue? Anon methinks, pale pictur'd to the view, I see the captive hurried o'er the deep; Or stern on high the felon monarch rue, Gorgeous with crimesâsublime on yonder steep His fortune ebbed to its lowest neap,â Thoughtful he eyes the solemn setting sun, With such grim sadness as the demons weep, The tempest over or the battle done, And owns perplex'd the Armageddon wonâ The sign that bids the warrior's purpose cease, Sees hopes of good, the fears of power outrun, And gemm'd with buds the olive boughs of peace. Thrall of the nations! could he see all these, Yet deem that men would ever worship more, Egg'd with the rapture of the brave's disease, War's brazen idol, 'smear'd with guilt and gore!â Though ineffectual, in my bosom's core As brightly burn'd as ere in his, that fire Which prompts the hero and the bard to soar, And gives to genius half its powerâdesireâ Let hymns of thankfulness to heaven aspire, That never to my young ambition came, The hope that oft is all ambition's hire,â The soldier's hope that ministers to fame. Far other phantoms smil'd upon my aim, Than cheer the bold in their refulgent themes,â I vainly thought some savage land to tame And with a halo of benignant beams, To sit rever'd, as with celestial gleams, The holy peaceful are in pictures crown'd,â Ah! baseless wishes, householdry of dreams, Vague thrift of sleepâas beingless as sound! THE INUNDATION. THE SOUND. How still! 'Tis as if Heav'n had spread a pall Of starless gloom, making the night seem death; The very rain-drops knelling as they fall, On the black lozen Scotch word for panes shaped like a hatchment. solemnly bequeath Mysterious reveries of tombs and dread, To the aw'd spirit, beck'ning to the dead.â Hark! what is that? a pond'rous chariot jarsâ Methinks a hearse some grinning spectre drives, And furiously. No; fir'd destruction cars;â Along the streets the hurrying engine strives,â No, no, it thunders;âdistant Vengeance wars, And stubborn Corlek A neighbouring mountain. from his station rives,â Almighty God! it is thy wrathful voice.â There is no earthquake, yet I heard the noise. THE DELUGE. âIt is the sea, it is the sea, O God! The wrathful waters flood again the Earth; âThe world is found'ring with its guilty load; The ocean comes. Oh, that we n'er had birth!â Such were the cries that in the darkness wild, Confusion raging, Chaos come again, Rose when the Deluge with Destruction toil'd, And Ruin clapp'd her hands and rush'd amain. For Death, in haste, came striding down the steep, To where the town lay in defenceless sleep, Not as his wont with crown and sceptre black, But as a slave with throttling graps he came.â Grim mute Mutes, eastern executioners. of God! that haunts the havoc track, Where vengeance storms in war, with hurricanes of flame. From the first sound to the greatest height to which the waters rose, between eight and nine feet, was but ten minutes. The springing of a mine only can be compared to this. The width of the flood was in the town fully half a mile. THE BURIALS. A DIRGE. Adapted to a modulation of the dead march in the Oratorio of Saul, with a gong accompaniment. Stop, stranger, stop; oh you may not come here. True, 'tis the fair,âbut the streets are all clear. Hears'd are the dead and the hearses draw near, As if once again reigned the pestilence here. They come,âthey come,âblack, black, behold they come. They come,âthey come,âtheir home is now the tomb. They come,âthey come,âthey are all going home. Anotherâand anotherâon they go; Anotherâand anotherâwo, wo, wo! For neither pomp nor pageantry, the wheels move slow. The loved and the lover,âlie there side by side, The bridegroom is there,âwith his beautiful bride; And fathers, and mothers, and babies that were,â Tremendous Jehovah, thy silence is there! THE TRUE BLUE. (Founded on an incident of the Inundation.) Dark, dark it was, as if all Nature lay Wrapt with that silence in which sleep the stars, When the dread coming sounding far away, A tar heard list'ning as with brother tars. 'Twas rain and gloom; he look'd towards the hills; He saw it luridly in all its might, And calmly said, âwe knew it, and all's right;â The rising flood his shudd'ring chamber fills. âWhat, is all right?â his frantic consort cries, And, dreadless dressing, he unmov'd replies, Aw'd as a sailor rides the white maned wave, When midnight frowns and tempests awe the brave;â The floods all thund'ring,âall the town awake,â The roar and cries then as ten thousand drums, But as his life that trifle were the stake,â âThe world is done, and God Almighty comes.â THE IMMOLATION OF ANTINOUS. 'Twas midnight, and with soundless steps the slaves, Like flitting phantoms glided to and fro, When darkly oar'd on Nilus sable waves, Thick starr'd with lights, majestically slow, The sacred galley came. The sough of woe, Rose from the shores, the people'd shores where stood Thousands on thousands, as the awful show, Urg'd on mysteriously the spangled flood. Sable and vast, it was the Memphian hearse, Where sat the pontiffs in refulgent state; Solemn they sat, obedient though averse, Whom Adrian sick had sent to question Fate. And all beheld it, and the signal wait, That would proclaim his tasks of glory done, But hurrying torches at the palace gate, Show'd that the battle was nor lost nor won. Then forth abash'd the sadden'd sages came, Whose drugged possets prov'd of no avail, To stay the fading of that vital flame, Which linger'd feebly, fitful, startling pale. See Adrian's address to his soul. And in the halls an ineffectual wail, Was heard as oft as from the couch they rose, Where panting lay the hero of a tale That had been toldâa pageant's murmuring close. Rais'd from the bed, by cords of golden twine, The purple curtains in festoons display The dying monarch, as he lies benign, The wrestle o'er, but loth yet to be clay. In grief around his summer friends survey,â Only such friends for dying monarchs mourn; And silver lamps partake the dim dismay, Inspiring fancies of the funeral urn. Yet not I ween the courtier train alone, Beholds the ensigns of triumphing deathâ With frequent gaze and long foreboding moan, One friend was there of undiminish'd faith. Subdu'd with dread, he seem'd to hold his breath, As if in vision he did Death discern, There mute and busy. Fated Adrian with A wond'ring glance survey'd him, cow'd but stern. And kindly sad, and with a gentle look, Thank'd the poor dog that in the final hour, Remain'd so faithful, dreadless of rebuke, And true to him unaw'd by rank and power. Ah, why so truant, from the tainted bower, Does oft the fairest and the friendliest fly, Yet see the messan to his master cower, Stretch on the grave and lay him down to die? Anon was heard amidst the gloom without, The heavy coming of some dreadful thing; And whispering voices, fearful as the shout That hoarse avengers into darkness fling. In long array, the pontiffs now they bring, With blazing torches, but with trumpets still, And soften'd odes afar the chorists sing, As mystic priests the royal chambers fill. Romanes then, the sovereign pontiff, goes Towards the couch where low the monarch lay, And in the midst, apart dejected, shows, What doom and hests the oracles convey. âDeath darkens round,â he said, âno hand can stay âHis lifted dart, and thou great king no more âArt of the earth, unless some mortal slay âHimself for thee, to bathe in his life's gore. âNot in obedience to thy dread command, âNot as a sacrifice by duty driven, âBut free as flows the billow o'er the sand, âAnd voluntary as the winds of heav'n. âHis placid mind must not by ought be riven, âOr hope, or fear, or vision of reward, âFor love alone he must be free self given, âTo change the destiny of his lov'd lord.â Romanes ceas'd, a freezing silence spread Throughout the halls, and Adrian heav'd a sigh, He saw no victim, but with fondling dread, The dog drew near, beholding his sad eye, And lick'd his hand and seem'd to say I'll die.â A hectic blush the world's great master own'd, To see the courtly throng retiring shy, But feebly patted the poor faithful hound. As if asham'd, the genius of mankind, Thaw'd at the sight, to think the envied great, Was to the fellowship of worms consign'd, Yet know a ransom had been fix'd by Fate, And bore the tidings to the palace gate, Where pensive stood a solitary youth, The gentle Antinous, whose base estate Had not extinguish'd beauteous Nature's ruth. A kinless slave from distant lands was he, Mild in his mein, a stranger in the throng, Who mus'd on times when he was bounding free, And life was then but only sport and song. Oh, dream of youth, that man would still prolong, Still ever cherish, as the vestal maid Shelters the altar: when as cares among The holiest things, the grim and fell invade. His only joy, if joy it might be called, The longing fancy of a lonely heart, Was in the wild to wander unappall'd, And to the echo of the rocks impart Remember'd scenes, that rose, white clouds athwart, The clear blue ether of the skyey dome, Far from the trophies of Egyptian art,â That sylvan nook, the nest that was his home. His musing eye and bland sequester'd air, Imperial Adrian oft wond'ring saw, And with the kindness of paternal care, Beheld him meek to solitudes withdraw, Where silent Nature hush'd repose to awe, And pleas'd to see it was his peaceful bent, Not an ill thought's unsocial secret gnaw, Would sooth his waywardness into content. In all the countless, glittering, flattering throng, That shone around where Adrian was seen, Not one so lov'd him for himself, among The mingling myriads, as full well I ween, Did that calm stripling of the pensive mein. Thus when abroad Romanes tidings flew, The youth, that such the fatal will had been, Sigh'd in his heart and far aloof withdrew. The live long night he saw, as meteor stars, The gliding torches of the palace gleam, And heard around the angry strife and jars Of men that call'd the dread response a dream, Bred in grim caves where crafty prophets scheme; But still anon would the soft thought return, Still to his heart sweet pity's tender theme, And in his grief he could but ever mourn. At last the dawning of the cheerful light, Gladdening like melody the orient sky, Dissolv'd the silence of the solemn night, And Antinous did to the palace hie; But there still ever was a doleful cry, âThat generous Adrian, the great and gay, âWas unredeem'd, and unredeem'd must die, âLord of the world, to be resolv'd to clay.â âIt shall not be,â with firm but lowly voice, The pitying Antinous determined said, And soon the shoutings of a joyful noise, The lofty domes and vaulted roofs pervade. Hopeless far gone, in his empurpled shade, The monarch lay, his scepter'd greatness done, But rushing slaves the shadowy room invade. And ready menials for Romanes run. A thousand voices to ten thousand call, âA willing victim has been found.â 'Twas then That Adrian breathing to the conscious wall, Turn'd his pale eye and look'd again on men, Where stood young Antinous. With altering ken He saw the youth and said, âAh long and late, âThe Gods invidious were as misers when, âThey will'd but one to share their rival's fate. Amidst the thunder of resounding drums, And bellowing trumpets, insolent afar, The proud Romanes in his chariot comes,â With cataract hurling drives the rattling car, Like pond'rous engines furious driven to war. For in that cool and twilight morning hour, He deem'd ascendant, blaz'd his order's star, Enspher'd with prodigies of pomp and power. âIf you great Adrian,â said the gorgeous priest, âSincere believe him, let the victim die; âBut Antinous if thou deceptive beest, âThe Gods will punish thine iniquity. âWithin thy bosom's folded secrecy, âThe truth lies hid, and if by life or death, âSucceed thine art or thine integrity. âWe in the oracles must still have faith.â âMy blood and life are all I have to give,â Replied the youth, âto prove myself sincere, âAnd if the king of men may yet survive, âHe can bestow, 'tis all I hope, a tear.â A tear! with wonder, almost on his bier, The speechless monarch look'd and seem'd to say, âThe world for itâthe Roman world is dear,â While firm Romanes bade the youth obey. On to the temple of Anubis then, With pontiff pride, and far refulgent show, The thoughtful stripling leaves the scenes of men, That on the altar there his blood may flow. From all the city rose the wail of woe, Mingl'd with shouts and heart afflicting howls, While priests in cells of vaulted gloom below, Arrange the knives and sacrificial bowls. The lamps burn numberless, unseen resound, Anthems of glory to the Gods sublime, And kneeling myriads worshipping around, Egyptian praises to Anubis hymn. Vast from within a solemn sounding chime, As if the Deity sat there enthron'd, Holy and mighty, to the chanted rhyme, Tremendous toll'd a mystical respond. Then there was silence and a fragrant fume Around the altar, slow ascending rose, As when a present God in golden gloom, With radiance mantled, into vision glows. Anon for pomp of sacrifice unclose The altar veils, by hands in secret furl'd, And gentle Antinous to view expose, âAs stands the statue that enchants the world.â OCCASIONAL VERSES. TO THE BIENYANS. Oh sweetly on thy verdant brow, The setting sun is shining now; On boskey steep and hoary crest, The ling'ring glory of the west Appears; but why this bosom pain? Green hill I ne'er shall climb again! I have beheldâah, transient too, As gleams on thee the amber hue, Capricious fortune haste away, As from thy cliffs the golden ray, Why felt I then this bosom pain? Green hill I ne'er shall climb again! Remorseless on my languid bed, I too have seen diseases shed, And hope, with health forever fly, Leaving but one lone wishâto die, Why felt I then this bosom pain? Green hill I ne'er shall climb again! Sad on the murmuring shore I sit, While round the nightly shadows flit,â As flit afar the dreams that made Thy scenes so gay, the scenes that fade, Why felt I then this bosom pain? Green hill I ne'er shall climb again! And I have known the sward beneath, The dearest laid, embrac'd by death, And seen the darlings of my heart Courageous to the world depart; Why felt I then this bosom pain? Green hill I ne'er shall climb again! What is this pang, this nameless wo, That makes the tear unbidden flow, To see but on thy distant height, The parting radiance omen night, This boding grief, this bosom pain, Oh hill I ne'er can climb again! SLEEP. Oh Sleep, sweet Sleep, my gentle Laura, Some soft headed and hard hearted have supposed Petrarch's Laura was an abstract idea, a man in love with an abstract idea! I have known, however, people enamoured of number one. Sleep. In vain, alas! must I forlorn complain, Like him of old that made Vaclusa weep, The fam'd Petrarca, must I sigh in vain. As playful damsels of the virgin train, At unawares, with softly slipping feet, Come in the midst of laughter-loving joys And lay their hands upon their lovers' eyes, Thou com'st to me. Oh, spare that sport unmeet. Come, rather come, in the dull dreary night, When I thy fondness may unblushing greet, And watching silence sees, thy dreams alight On my sad pillow, while disease and care Departing fly, that have too long been there. VERSE MAKING. They little know the wayward heart who deem, The muse that visits such a couch as mine, For pelf or praise would ape the poet's dream, Or think I thought the afflatus ere divine. No: but to wile away the weary night, When sleep and all her visions take to flight, As from the restless waves the sea birds rise,â When blasts blow bleak and darkly scowl the skies, I invocate the muse. Oh come, oh come, For 'tis not wise to wish myself at home. I can but fitful read or write, the string Must unmolested now for ever sleep,â The muse but as the wakeful bird may sing, That sings so sadly listeners can but weep. THE MORNING STAR. Page of the morning, from whose cheerful eye, The shades of night begin to fade and fly, Thy smile, alas, I may no longer hailâ Inconstant sleep rejects my wooing pray'r, No more my pillow now she deigns to share, Nor with the truant can I more prevail; Like health and fortune riding on the gale, She scorns my couch and seldom visits there. Ah thou bright thing, refulgent ens of joy, Comest thou to tell Aurora, though yet coy, Is on the mountains, as a maiden gay, Sprinkling betimes her winter's thrift with dew, Oh bid her yet, the fair Aurora stay, I can but yet her blithening presence rue. THE SUN. The ancient sun, careers in strength, as strong, As when in night the stars began to swarm, And round the angels stood, a wond'ring throng, To see it bowl'd by the Almighty arm. Yet I more precious than that sentenced sun, Lie useless here, my worldly orbit run. Yes, hours and days, and months, and years, of time, The Artist labour'd who constructed me, Though low I lie, whilst it encarr'd sublime, Rolls in magnificence and jubilee. Atom! at once into perfection brought, Material thing, thou souless entity: He struck the gloom, outglanc'd the spark he sought, But I was rear'd for immortality. THE EVENING STAR. Lily of light! thou lovely evening star, That gladdening sparkles to the coming Night. How like a child that joyous sees afar A spangl'd Nigress, and laughs with delight! 'Spher'd in the amethystine dome so bright, The poet's fancy in a dream of bliss Is not more pure, nor in the vast abyss Of contemplation, shines a thing so fair As thee, celestial spark, thou glory thereâ Yes, if it be as saintly sages say, That all the stars blest influences shed, Thine are the hopes that never own dismay, The only beams that cheer the sick man's bed, Without whose gracious light, life would indeed be dread. THE MOON. Friend and companion of the sleepless night, Sailing serene upon the heav'nly sea! Whence comes such soothing from thy peaceful light As the calm holiness of that delight, With which I walk'd Sicilian shores with thee. Methinks beyond the mountain's shadowy steep, I see again thy mild Aurora pale;â Afar are fishers on the starry deep, During a fine night, the Bay of Palermo, with the torches of the fishermen is exceedingly beautiful. And silence pleas'd awaits their fitful hail. Oh, sure from thee descends that conscious sleep, Which almost mitigates the sense of pain. But why does mem'ry prompt the heart to weep, For time long gone, that ne'er can come again, An ebbed stream in an unfathom'd main? TIME. Hark! 'tis the booming of the midnight bell, As if the old and melancholious Time Stood in the night, a solemn sentinel, And would the coming of the bygone tell, Hailing prophetical with voice sublime. Methinks I see him, as I hear the hour, Aloft and hoary, on an ancient tower;â His lean right hand an ebbing sandglass bears, And in his left, as if a flag of power, The dim and glimm'ring scythe of doom appears. To the stern minister of hopes and fears, The course of the Almighty's march is shown; Say, does He measure it with cycled years, Or counts by worlds and systems overthrown? SPRING. Look forth in pride ye everlasting hills! No more around impassion'd winter wars; Your baldrics don of mingled flowers and rills, For every rill is now a string of stars. The breeze so testy once no longer chills, Nor crystal ice the leaping torrent mars, The green-wood bough with wooing music thrills, And all the air a fragrant spirit fills, As gentle Spring the sheltering bud unbars. Young leaves peep out and feel with timid hand The sunny temper of the vernal ray; Like eager children that impatient stand, In refuge nooks on showery holiday, And cry, âthe rain is gone, come boys, let's out to play.â THE BATTLE OF LARGS. At twilight musing on some field renown'd, As in a glass hath scenes of yore amaz'd, With bright apocalypses all around, As if the past had his dropp'd curtain rais'd. Thus in ThermopylÃ¦, the Spartan band, I saw refulgent earn their death and fame, Beheld at Marathon the victors stand, Waiting the vanquish'd with as firm an aim. Thus too on Salamis' immortal wave, I shared the glories of the Grecian brave; And oft green Largs, in pensive boyhood's prime, Thy local genius hath arrested me, To show the valiant of an olden time, Tread proudly stern with patriot energy. THE MORN. In the green morning when the blithening sun Comes o'er the mountains as in early youth, It seems as life were just again begun, And all a vision that I found was truth. Why am I sad, are not my labours done? Why are these limbs no more by rest restored? Why does the bed refreshment ne'er afford, And mem'ry serve for dreams? Benignant past, Canst thou the dismal sense of suffering cheerâ Thou hast no cause to look so wild aghast, And I have business yetâto wipe a tear. Yes: 'tis a task to raise my heavy arm, And in the toil still pangs and pains alarm, But it is all the work that heav'n has for me here. PATRIA MIA. From the Italian of the Author. My native Land! oh, mother ever dear! Why dost thou eye me with cold looks askance? Why thus while life forsakes the borrow'd bier, Casts thou so on me a disdainful glance? Have I too idly whil'd my tasked time? Behold these ails! they never can be cur'd. Are they but sediments of care or crime?â Just heav'n has chronicl'd what I endur'd.â My hire was long with a most gracious smile, Benignant paid by a confiding heart. Midst hurling ruins, did I e'er recoil?â I heard the thunders, but with awe not start. And now the purposes of life are o'erâ Yes: I am useless now, and thee can serve no more. GOOD MEN. The Earth hath planets of a purer beam Than yon bright patents of the starry sky; These are the good men that the Seraphim See as they ward the battlements on high. Sometimes a cloud of mind-eclipsing ail, Sometimes the vapour of adversity, Their mortal splendour may obscure or veil, And mar the influence of their energy. But soon the moral mirk must pass away, Though low and dim, by mists conceal'd they roll, And skirt the hills, as if amidst dismay, They sought unseen the western setting goal. Still they are stars of everlasting light, And brighter seem to glow, yea in the darkest night. THE SUBLIME AND BEAUTIFUL. All can enjoy the beautiful and bland, But few can grasp the mighty or sublime, And many read, who rarely understand, The sacred themes by glorious Milton plann'd,â Things unattempted then in prose or rhyme. Some see no grandeur while with awe and dread, They shake lone shelter'd by the beetling rock, When raging waves in wild commotion mock The drifting wrack that's by the tempest sped, Nor in the shudd'ring earth's convulsive shock When Ãtna thunders and his lavas spread; But all enraptur'd feel the beauteous calm, When blooming summer breathes her fragrant balm, And icy misers thaw, and own a generous qualm.</field>
