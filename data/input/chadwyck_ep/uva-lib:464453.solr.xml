      <field name="fulltext">TO THE HIGH AND MIGHTIE PRINCE, Iames, BY the Grace of God, King of Great Brittaine, France and Ireland, &amp;c. DIVINE MEDITATIONS. Chap. I. [Singula de nobis anni predantur euntes. ] The shortnesse of mans life in respect of other creatures, yet how prodigall man is of time, esteeming it farre more basely then any other thing, notwithstanding the necessitie of bestowing it well since our eternall miserie or happinesse depends thereon. Viue memor quam sis Ã¦uibreuis: Horat. lib. 2. Sat. 6. Singula de nobis anni predantur euntes. Idem. Labimur sÃ¦uo rapienti fato. Ducitur semper noua pompa morti. Seneca in Oedip. How short's mans life, compar'd with other liues, The Elephant two hundred yeares suruiues His time, so doth the long liu'd Hart. And nature to the Rauen doth impart Three liues of Harts, and Elephants, altho The Hamadryad Nymphes thrice hers outgo. The longest date that most men here attayne Is eighty yeares stretcht out with griefe and payne, And yet, of this how small a time we liue, Sleepe challenges one half to him to giue: And youthfull dayes of vain [illeg.] A third of what the counts, the sorrowes gayne No little share, and dotage all the rest So of our dayes, our foes possesse the best, And we our selues enioy a share most small, Nothing, yet of that nothing prodigall. There are not many that doe freely lend Their vtensiles, and rayments to their friend. Because they know I Time all things waits and weares, Yet doe we lend our selues for many yeares, With small intreatie. One perswades, to day To hawke and hunt. Tomorrow he toth'play. This friend to's marriage, earnestly enuites, That to solemnize his dead parents rites. Another crew, they tempt vs to pertake In quarrels, where our whole times, at the stake. A thousand pull vs into game, and wine. Thus doe we lend, and giue our pretious time Time in whose vse, eternall ioyes doe dwell; Or woes for things most base we giue and sell. How much doe we bestow in fruitlesse vice? In feasts, in fashions, curiosities, In beastly lusts, nocturnall foule desires. How much to feed our passions flaming fires? How much in trimming vp the head and face, In singing, dancing, gaming, and things base. In fruitlesse studies, fraught with toyes and lies, Fabulous stories, impertinencies? Which times so spent, we cannot say that we Do liue, but that we sleepe, or dreaming be. How many childlesse men, each where appeares, Who hauing spent their youth, and best of yeares, In quest of gayne, and gold so much accurst, That also loose their latest times; and worst In griefe of heart, in anguish, and in payne, In broken sleepes, in sweat and trauels vaine, Onely to settle their ill gotten pelfes Where it might not be lost, yet loose themselues? This body takes vp all our time, and care. How many spend whole yeares, heere to prepare, (Euen for themselues) their marble monuments, Which in their whole age shewde no prouidence Nor forecast for the soule? Alas we see, Nothing but what is obuious to the eye Our vnderstanding partes, in sence, are drownd, How many be that for gaine circle rownde The whole worlds frame, and come home, fraught with yeres, As well as wealth, to whom no time appeares Fruitfull, themselues to [illeg.] and to gayne? Who can account th'innumerable traine Of those, that giue their time, to others vse? That goe, or sit, or sleepe, when others chuse, And eate still at anothers appetite? That by commaund doe either lothe, or lyke? How many that giue vp their times, and lifes, Still to be conversant in endlesse strifes, In following, or directing the affayres, And suites of other men? Which neuer cares For that expense of time that brings them coyne? They sweare, accuse, defend, bribe, and purloyne, Like Salamanders, liuing in the fire Of other mens contentions. Yet desire Nothing so much as time, which still they leese, And fondlie sell, to others businesses. We lauish time, as if it had no end. No man will share his money with his friend But time with euery one, we throw away: We loose each present time, and fayrest day For good occasions, and dispose of houres, Both dayes, and veeres, which often proue not ours. What darke cloudes ouershade the minds of men? How crosse affections are assign'd to them? When olde age comes, and death to claime his due, How young they be to learne to dye, how new? And time that was still vendible before, They then cry out, tis to be bought no more. We neuer know time spends, till time be gone, Then we would giue plate, gold possession, To the Phisition but for some few houres. We wring his hand. Such is this wit of ours. The time that Nature giues vs is not small. We make it little. Spending vainely all. We liue not to our selues. Those onely liue That doe themselues to contemplation giue, To vertuous actions: Practise, and endeuour, To liue well, so to die wel, and liue euer. NymphÃ¦ Hamadriades: quor? longissima vitÃ¦ est. Ausonius Chap. II. [Man hath a garden thats not very large] That mans hart the seat of the affections is as a tenant for tearme of life, demised and set ouer to the gouernement of Reason, by which it ought to be tilled, and cultiuate; so that in stead of hurtfull weeds, it may bring forth profitable hearbs. Man hath a garden thats not very large, nor very narrow, and it is his charge. To dresse the same, to prune and looke vnto it, Least weeds (instead of wholesome hearbs) oregrow it. Tis not his owne, he hath it but for life. And hence, God knowes, proceeds his care, as strife: For tide he is, each day, some fruits to bring, For this, to him that did demise the thing But he (alas) can no way pay his rent, Tho for the same he knowes he shall be shent. For tho he toyle, and labours to his powre, To kill the weeds, that soring there euery howre; Yet still they multiply, and still grow more, Out of old rootes, comes new not knowne before So thicke, that one of seuerall kinds may take Handfuls at once, but must enquirie make A long long time for any wholesome plant; For in this Garden those be wondrous seant: No Palmes or Vynes grow here for louers true; No Rosemarie (an hearbe to Hymen dew; No heauenly thrift this Garden doth beget; Nor honestie (by Nature) neere a whit; Their growes not int a dram of any Sage: Some Time, but much neglected till old age: Roses once grew therein, and Lillies toe, But in their roomes Hemlocks and Deaths hearbs now: Hysop, thats giuen by heauen to wash vs cleare, Oft withers through dispairing Willowes neare. And bitter Rew that brings our chiefest games, This hardly growes with industrie and paines: For all this ground's with such fowle weeds growne ouer, That each iudicious eye may plaine discouer, The Gardiners most manifest neglect, Or in the ground some naturall defect. Both must we grant (defectiue all herein) That we by shew, not substance measure them. Things faire, tho hurtfull, so the sense beguile, That we them nourish, tho they kill the whise. Vnto our Landlord lets therefore resigne Our interest: Dispose it Heauen, tis thine; And Heauens bright eie that once wept teares of blood, Showre grace downe on our hearts, and make th? good. Chap. III. [The dunghill base neglected ground, that breeds] The difference betweene a rude neglected mind, and a mind directed by grace, and gouernd by reasons discipline, instant by example of difference in grounds. The dunghill base neglected ground, that breeds Nothing but stinking Hemlocks, and vile Weeds; Burdocks, Briers, Brakes, and contemptible things, Differs not more from Gardens of great Kings, Where Art and Nature friendly seeme to vie, Which should each others worke most beautifie, Where cunning Artists hand ingrafts, and stocks The Pistachene, the Peach, or Aprikocks; Where shadie Groues, rare Fruits, and fragrant Ayre, Soft downie Carpets, burbbling Fountaines cleare, Conspire to make a sensuall happinesse. The rude vnpollisht earth differs from these Not halfe so much (I say), as doth that mind, Which sensuall lusts and appetites doe bind, Captiuing reason that should be their King; Differ from those where artfull pollishing, All vagrant lusts and soule desires haue tide, Subdued by Grace, to Reason sanctified. But as earth doth not of it selfe produce Those things that are most needfull for mans vse, Which by much toyle and tillage are acquired So those things that by Heauen are most desired, And sought for in our selues, they doe not grow From our corrupt affections; but doe flow From the reflection of that light Diuine, Without which, darknes doth our soules confine; Without which, these our hearts most vile fruit brings, Euen Lusts, Rebellions, Treasons, and worst things: For earth and man, for sinne together curst, Nor earth, nor man, seeme what they were at first. Poore man seemes now like Ierusalems The Temple of Ierusalem, now a Turkish Moschet. Phane, The place where God was thought once to remaine, And to inhabit, that's become a den Of theeues, a propugnacle for vile men, (Gods enemies, that lies for truth belieue) From whence both God and all his Saints they grieue. So mans heart that created was to be A Phane, or Temple for the Deitie; A Castle, and a Fortresse is become, To harbor treasons and rebellion Gainst God and goodnesse. This a Fort is made, From whence vncleane desires and lusts inuade The Vnderstanding, and depraue the Will: So that, that knowes not good, this followes ill. Chap. IIII. [The fairest and best things thus misapplied] The best things abased most dangerously for vnderstanding which in Mans first estate, made him little lesse then Angels; being now depraued, makes him many times more miserable then beasts. The fairest and best things thus misapplied, Seeme soule, and all their natiue beautie hide. Gold, that seemes faire for health, or ornament, Seemes foule when it betrayes the innocent Beautie thats good with chastitie and grace Seemes vile bestowed vpon th'immodest face: And vnderstanding which by farre transcends, All else wherewith Dame Nature vs befriends, (The Sunne that should irradiate the soule) How faire t'was pure? But now depraued. how foule? The beasts that doe enioy no more then sence, Doe seeme to this, to offer lesse offence, Then we to reason: for their appetite Doth in it's proper objects most delight. The Silk worme that for ornament is [illeg.] Her appetite is still the same to spin: The Bees alone her hony-house to frame; Both Hawke and Hound haue each their proper Game: Th'Apodes doe not seeke to goe or swim; Ayre serues alone to keepe and nourish them. The Dolphin nere attempts the earth to know For if he touch the earth, he dieth so. Nor seekes the silly Mole to swim or flie, But in the earth alone to delue and die. And those same Flies in Cyprian furnace found (Bred in the fire) hate water, ayre and ground. All things, but Man, are streight in their desires; He onely wrong, where rightnes Heauen requires: God made him vpright, with erected brow To looke at Heauen, and not with beasts to bow To earth. God gaue him Angels mind and face, But he alone seekes things terrean, and base. The obiect of our intellect is Cum veritas sit obiectum intellectus, id cir?co? id erit maxime obiectum intellectus quod est maxime veritas, essentialiter, &amp; originaliter nempe Deus. Cur ergo intellectus hominis tam difficulter apprehendit Deum, ipso Arist. teste. nam 2. Metaphis. cap. 1. inquit. intellectus hominis habet se ad ea quÃ¦ sua natura sunt manifestissima, non secus ac occuli vespertilionum ad lumen meridianum? Respondetur sicut sol sua natura est maxime visibilis, quia per solem omnia fiunt visibilia, ita quoque Deum sua natura esse maxime intelligibilem, quia per Deum omnis humanus intellectus illuminatur. Quod autem sol a vespertilionibus non recte videatur, id soli penitus per acdidens esse, &amp; totum oriri Ã  defectu in oculis vespertilionum, at que adeo quod Deus ab homine non ita clare intelligatur id non esse Ã  natura Dei, sed Ã  defectu, qui est in homine. Keckerman, Sest. phiss. Liv. 4. Trewth, And therefore chiefly God. Put Man pursewth Nothing so much as falshood, follie, lies, Instead of substance, shadowes, nullities. The obiect of our will is also Vt Deus quoque tanquam prima veritas est maxime intelligibilis; sic vt prima bonitas est summe volibilis, ibidem: prout enim cognoscimus ita volumus. Good, And goodnesse selfe the, chiefest good, thats God: Tho still our minds, and thus depraued will, Nothing so much affect as what is ill. God is the obiect of each perfect mind: But Hell and blacknes in the most we find. Our minds, like Clocks, composde of many wheeles, Each day new change, and alteration feeles, Either they goe too fast, or else too slow; Idle they rust, in action fairely shew. Each day we must with teares of penitence, Wish them from foule dust of concupiscence, And diligently wind them vp with care And meditation, else they fruitles are. Chap. V. [The cruell Beares amongst themselues agree] The combate betwixt Reason and the sensuall appetites. Diis proximus ille est, Quem Ratio, non Ira mouet. The cruell Beares amongst themselues agree, The Wolfe to Wolues is not an enemy: But man to man is still the greatest foe; Nay, man himselfe vnto himselfe is so, Whose faculties seeme into parties sided, Irrationall from rationall deuided; Like campes of enemies that quarter keepe With watchfull Sentinels that seldome sleepe, Fearing surprisall and inuasion: For Reason in the head which hath his throne, Obedience of the heart as Prince requires: But th'heart of rebell lusts and foule desires Of passions and deprau'd affections seate Shakes off all dutie, and doth ill entreate Reason her King; inuading so the mind, That Reason seemes to yeeld, and to resigne His soueraigntie; opprest with force and might Of those, that should obey by law and right. Reason in vaine perswades this crew to law, To patience, to obedience and iust awe Vnto the King of Kings, which hath him sent His lawfull substitute in gouernment. For th'rebell Passions and Desires accurst, All bonds of dutie and obedience burst, Trampling the loyall subiects vnderfoote. Humilitie by Pride is beaten out, And Loue by Hatred; and Concupiscence To Temperance commits no lesse offence. Despaire wounds Hope; Crueltie, Mercie kills; Prophanenes weighes downe Pietie with ills. Auarice locks vp Bountie; Inpudence Whips away Modestie; Maleuolence, Beneuolence; and what is most vniust, White Chastetie is slaue to filthy Lust. Reuenge cries out for murder, and for blood; Reason perswades, and councells, us not good: But Anger bursts forth to the palace flies, And there sets all a fire, the face and eies, Enuy like venombde Aspes in dust which lies Vnseene, or spied, stings reason secretly. Pleasure charmes him with her sleepie spell, That so Securitie at ease may kill. Ambition beares him then with wings on high, Aboue the Mountaines and the lower Skie, To some high precipisse, where seruile Feare, The last, and worst, insults vpon him there. Yet sometime Reason doth her foes conuince, Displaying th'ensigne of white Innocence, And guarded by faire Virtues, doth in fight Vanquish, and put these hell black bands to flight: Tho much more oft their strengths so equall seeme, That whose the victor is, not clearely seene. But Reasons appetite seldome preuailes, For that of Sense, this violently hales Vpon the wings of foule desires to ill, Most oft without the minds discourse or will, Because that moues without this, this not so, Till free from this her instrument she goe. They chase each other; sometime these decline, And sometime those, then gaint another time. Th'enlightned mind would meditate or pray, But th'appetite that all for ease cries, nay. So when this moues for pleasure, lust, or sleepe, Then that relucts. Thus warres they euer keepe. Who maruels then that houses often flame, Where Guests so contrarie inhabit them: When the affections striue to tumble downe Reason, whom Nature gaue so faire a Crowne, With purpose that all things should it obey. But how's this warre? do contraries beare sway In the soules simple essence? Can there be In Reason an irrationalitie? Or doe three soules deuided vs possesse, As learned Plato sometime did professe? Or ist our sensuall appetites that still Peruert our minds, sinne darkned, and our will, Which looke but at time present and obiect Things proper to themselues to th'intellect, In stead of proper obiects, and true good, Perswading to false obiects, and false good. In affections these depraued. darken the mind: Desires that should be bound our soules fast bind In Gyues of sinne, till Grace illuminate The mind, and free it from this captiue state. Chap. VI. [Thus man is like a Towne fortified well] An amplification of the same by way of comparison to a Cittadell besieged and betrayed. Thus man is like a Towne fortified well With circling walls and high built Cittadell In place most eminent, where Warders stand Still prest to act their Gouernors command, In fitting seruice readie to expose Their safeties to repell their open foes, And to giues blowes for blowes most readily To each profest and open enemy. But when deceit puts on a friendly face, And offers gold, or greatnes, in this case, They rocke the Conscience, and with seeming gaine, Doe selfe consuming treasons entertaine. Yet because these cannot so freely do, Except the Gouernour consent thereto: They runne with no small tumult to aske leaue, That instantly they may themselues bereaue Of happines and freedome, for some ends Obiected by their foes, but seeming friends: Which if the ruler, Reason do denie, Th'affections streight fall into mutinie. Malice bursts forth (and armd with ancient grudge) Perswades the rest, that Reason's no fit Iudge Of this their present grieuance: for while they Labour with wants and wounds both night and day, He feeles not these misfortunes. Auarice The money and rewards she amplifies. Ambition speakes of dignities and place, That will be got by yeelding in this case. Dispaire and Feare then muster all our wants, And still the forces of our foes aduance. Vp to a triple number. So that here The Captaine both assail'd with Hope and Feare Seemes doubtfull, which they taking for consent, Force him to accomplish this their worst intent, Tho not to yeeld the place, yet to take in (Instead of Innocence and Goodnes) Sinne Rebellious Lusts, and Treasons base and ill, Gainst God, which gaue this mansion to his will, The Senses and the Members seruants fit, To operate and doe the precepts writ, In Reasons tables, tho too often they Themselues, and this their soueraigne doe betray Both to their owne and Gods foes, and are sold For base desires, and thirst of cursed Gold. Chap. VII. [How much are men then beasts more foolish still?] The blindnesse and stupiditie of man aboue all other creatures which euery one know, and by all meanes oppugne that enemie which Nature hath assigned them; onely he admits and lodges in his bosome me that enemie, which alone hath most power to destroy him, namely, Sinne. How much are men then beasts more foolish still? We know not friends from foes which worke our ill, The Owle, t'auoyd the Crow, trauels by night. The Vulture shuns the Kingly Egles sight. The Egithus torments the Asse her foe, Because her scrubbing doth so oft orethrow Her younglings, and the terror of her bray, Frighes them so, that to the earth down dead fall they, Th'Elephants note the sod where mans foote treads. The Crocodile th'Ichnewmon knowes and dreads. Th'Aspe shuns the Spider, and Camelion The Rauen knowes, and feares the Aesalon; Which (tho a little Bird) her time still spies To take the liues of her young enemies. The Hyen feares mans footing, and doth know (Tho neuer seene before) that hee's her foe. Nature to beasts imparts this wit and light, That they discerne their foes at the first sight. But man, then beasts more blind, and more vnwise, Cannot distinguish friends from enemies. A poysonous serpent lodges in his brest. Few will beleeue that such a noysome guest Harbours so neare. But Iuie not entwines The Oke so fast, as this our heart strings bindes; Where pietie and vertue should haue place, Our greatest foe, this serpent we embrace. Tho folly is not Youths more constant Page, Disease and dotage nearer kin to age, Then is destruction to the Serpents sting. The Serpent that I mention here, tis Sinne; An egge first by that worst of Serpents layd, Which more then all the Serpents hath decayd. The Aspe and two-headed Amphisbena; The Basiliske and Catablepha. The horn'd Cerestes, Alexandrian Sckincke, Dipsas and Drynas causing thirst and stincke. The Vyper, Scorpion, and Sallamander, The Remora, Torpedo, Scolopender, Tarantula that wines effects procures, Mirth, sadnes, madnes, all which musick cures. The amorous Pederotes manlike faest, The Higoana, delicate in taste; The monstrous Boa, harmelesse vnprouokt, The fearefull Dragons, in selfe knots fast yokt, Their teeth and stings this flesh alone annoy: But these both bodies doe, and soules destroy. Chap. VIII. [Blest Innocence, how faire a thing art thou?] The prayse of Innocence. Blest Innocence, how faire a thing art thou? Thou needst not feare the Mauritanean bow: A brazen wall thou art, that doest defend From dangers all, thy Owner and thy Friend. For when by chance the impious shooter hits; Thy wounds redounds to thee, as benefits. In pouertie and want the worldling faints: But these with hope and patience thee acquaints. In Stormes at sea, in Earthquakes and in Thunder, Then quakes the guiltie man, and cleaues in sunder. But Innocence no change at all doth feele At sight of tyrants, tempests, fires, or steele. Blest Innocense, then Lillies farre more white, The vernall Roses are not halfe so sweete; More cleare, and faire, then all those beauties goe, On Christall fronts, of Thames, of Scyne, and Poe. The Silks of Taurus, cloth of Tyrus die, Are ornaments of no such dignitie. The Cypresse, Ceader, and the Ebene locks, The stateliest Towres with Chyan marble tops, Reach not so neare to heauen. The flowrie greene So flourishing and fresh, doth neuer seeme. The Mines of Peru and of Ophir, be Vnto their owners not so rich as thee, Which then the bright Carbuncles of Cambaia, And stones, do'st far more brighter beames display. The seats of Kings, and most resplendant throne, With beames more bright then thine, they neuer shone. Oh holy Innocence, which good men loue; The Manna of the Saints, and soules aboue! How poore are all these things to shew thy praise? Yet still we tell thee for the worst of these. Chap. IX. [Oh then what tongue can speake, what wit discrie] A deploration of mans misery, subiect to so many tribulations and errours in this life, more then other creatures. Oh then what tongue can speake, what wit discrie The wretched state of mans sad miserie! Begot in sinne, and form'd in grones and teares; Brought forth with pain, bred vp with cares &amp; feares, Pollisht in youth, ofttimes with fruitlesse Art, In riper age to giue each better part, To feede of pride and lust, the fatall fires, We pine our soules, to feast our foule desires. We kill our friends, to feede and cloth our foes, And at their lure we stoope to greatest woes. Blind in our selues, depriu'd of heauenly light, We praise the day, but yet pursue the night, We health commend, yet deare diseases buy. We honour wealth, yet run for pouertie. We wish for ease, yet seeke our owne vnrest. We couet Kingdomes, yet forgo the best For trash and toyes: then Indians more vnwise, That sell pure Gold for basest merchandize. Oh happie you in libertie created, That to disease and death were neuer fated! Man onely may lament, that liues exiled From Heauen his country, and is forc't to build These brittle mansions in this barren clay, Where mists and dampie vapours euery day, Cause vs our path directed homeward misse,! And oft to fall from some high precipise Downe to the center; oft in foule myres fall, And there like swine still wallow; Often call In vaine for mortall helpe. The wisest err, Being still misled by this wild wanderer: And most, when most of all on Heauen they tell, And thinke they touch the Gates, then knock at Hell. Oh God how blest were man if he were wise? But as he is, how full of miseries? You scalie creatures in the brinie, deepe, Which know not what it is to sigh or weepe: You flying armies in the ayre that houer; You, you are blest that mens griefes nere discouer. You Heards are happy, that one hills doe feed, Free from the woes that humaine hearts doe breed. You smiling Flowers, in colours freshly seene; You lowly Vallies, clothed in louely greene; You fruitfull Oliues, set in comely rankes, You long liu'd Cedars, on [illeg.] bankes, Your state is blest; you flourish, fade and die, And know not any future miserie. Chap. X. [The race of men is like the leaues of trees] A further exemplification of mans misery by comparison to flowers, to leaues, to fields, to fishes. The race of men is like the leaues of trees, The greatest part whereof in ditches fall, Or straw the durtie earth, tost by the brize Of wanton winds that sport themselues withall: Few doe they lay aloft on towres of state, Much fewer thence doe not precipitate. The race of men are like the Flowers, that be By Nature giuen their mother Earth t'adorne As well with beautie, as varietie Of their indowments. Some haue comely forme But little vertue. Noble some, not faire; Some great, but weake; some small, whose force most rare. Oft-times misplast. The cordiall Violet And fragrant Rose in ditch or high-way side: And Henbane, and Cicuta ranke, vnset, In fairest Gardens, are not seldome spied. But most in this do we resemble Flowers, We spring, we flourish, wither in few howres. The race of men are like the scalie traine, Of nimble Fish, in siluer Iourdans streame, That while they follow prey, or sportfull game, (Ignorant of the danger nearest them) Fall with the sliding waues, that swiftly flie Into the Mare Mortuum, and die. The world's a streame, most pleasing to our eies, But from our sights much faster, swifter gliding, Then Iourdan to the Mare Mortuum flies. The Fish are men, that in the same are biding, Who while in Pleasures streames they bathe &amp; dwell, Are carried downe therewith, and slide to Hell. Now for the Leaues and Flowres, they may accuse The Winds, that most their beauties doth deface. The Fish, of apprehension most obtuse, May challenge Nature for their wretched case. But man, that little lesse then Angels knowes, Can blame none but himselfe for all his woes. Chap. XI. [This flesh is but the barke vnto the soule] Mans estate in this present World, resembling a ship tost vpon the Waters, described with her tackling, what it now is, and what it ought to be; written at Sea, as a Sea-compasse for Saylors, but may serue for any profession. This flesh is but the barke vnto the soule, Whose Harbour's Heauen, and the earth her Sea; Her lading's Sinne, which when the weather's foule, Still shoores and hazards ruine instantly: Tho it misdoubting neither threatning skies, Nor wants, nor haplesse Pilot onward hies. Tho all wrong fated Sayles and Masts all wrong, Her Shrouds are Vanitie, her rigging, Pride; Her Masts, Youth, Strength; the Saile that beare her on, Custome and Ignorance. She knowes no tide But th'Ebs &amp; Floods of Fortune which stil proue her, Loue, Hate, Feare, Hope, these be the winds that moue her. Her Houlds ill mann'd, there Ease and barren sleepe, Securitie and Vnbeliefe lie snorting: Scorne, Stubbornnesse, Reuenge the Hatches keepe, And Auarice her Stearesman still stands porting. Desire the Master, Sensuall appetite Her Compasse, from the right way wander quite. Her Ordnance are Othes; Pikes Pollicies Cables and Anchors, Fortunes various measures. While thus accommodated, swift she flies, About the world to seeke the Ports of Pleasure And Game. Who missing these she ofter hit Destruction and Dispaires sad Rocks, and split. Therefore this way to ruine leading iust, Needs must this tyre and I ackle altred be. Repentance therefore be her lading must; Then must Humilitie and Modestie Be Shrouds and Tackle for her. Patience Must be her Masts; and snow-white Innocence. Wisdome and Knowledge ought the Sayles to be: The Tides t'obserue, are th'ebbs and floods of Grate; Her Winds are Thankfulnesse and Pietie: Loue, Charitie, which driue to heauen apace. Her men are Vigilancie, Warinesse, Diligence, Constancie, Contentednesse. Her Stearesman must be Prouidence herein: Gods Sp'rit her Master, Compasse Holy Writ; Her Ordnance they must be Sighs for Sin: Pikes, Prayers; Bullets, Teares: thus must she fight. The Cables whereupon she may depend, Are Faith and Hope in Christ her onely friend. Obedience is her Port and place of stay; And Honesty and Vertue, there's her fraight; Where if she lade, bright Bethlems Starre both day And night, shall guide her course from dangers straight, Vnto the Port of Joy, to liue with him In his CÃ¦lestiall Ierusalem. Chap. XII. [Now you that in this worlds wide sea doe saile] The benefit of Constancie for those that must saile through these dangerous Seas. Now you that in this worlds wide sea doe saile, Still trusting that faire wind, and happie tide, Calme weather, and smooth sea shall neuer faile, But friend you still: you reckon mainely wide. The waues of this our constant seeming Ocean Are most vnconstant, rowl'd with restlesse motion. One while a swelling surge beares vs on high, As if to Heauen-ward it would make our way: And, that past by, another instantly Seemes in the lowest center vs to lay. Still are we tost, and feare: but nothing armes Vs, sauing constancie, from these their harmes. For tho the stormes encrease, and weather thick; Tho seas and winds seeme rebels to their Lord: Yet Constancie will to her tackling stick, When desperate men amaz'd leape ouer-board: And (fearing one) doe into two deaths run: But Constancy will keepe her cargazon. Some minds are but with earthly obiects fed: But perfect soules doe flie a higher pitch: In deepest waues they beare aloft their head, (While many a worldling drownes in euery ditch;) Tho prest by wants, and enuies waues, oft-times Halfe swallowed: yet are such minds rich as Mines. For these liue euer, those exhausted be, Or lost by death: but these all times suruiue, While carrion wits, which onely at dung flie; When Fortune frownes, euen The Lotos of Euphrates is one of the Solisequij, in the morning when the Sunne rises she puts vp her head aboue the water, as it were to look upon the face of her Louer, and to congratulate his returne, and still more and more aduancing her head till the Sunne come to the Meridian, and then as he begins to decline, it declines, and at his setting puts her head vnder water, and so discending still lower and lower till midnight, at which time the Watermen can hardly find it with their longest poles and crookes. Pliny. Lotos like they diue In the cold frozen streames of sad dispare, And till she shine againe they buried are. But Constancie with no false feares can welt: No sad Dispaire can lodge within her mind; Nor is she like those leaden soules that melt, When to the fires of triall they're assign'd: For she reflects all sorrowes, and to death At last giues thanks for taking of her breath. Chap. XIII. [Bvt should we now on fate, or our selues plaine] A further expression of the incessant troubles and sorrowes to which men are subiect in this life, and especially those men that meane best; with the benefit of Patience. Bvt should we now on fate, or our selues plaine, Since euery thing hath limit saue mans woe? Time doth the winter, spring, day, night conteine In bounds, Stormes blow not still. Seas sometime flow As well as ebb. But vnto some men fall, Saue Winters Darknes, Ebbs, Stormes nought at all. Time giues the busie Bee a time to rest: The Halcyon hauing built her house lies Inn. The warie Ant in winter keepes her neast. The silly Silkeworme doth not euer pinn. The easefull Horse knowes night, and painefull Oxe, Is then but seldome forc't to beare the yoaks. Th'Obdorians die but once a yeare with frost, The Ceremissi haue not euer night. The sunne-burnt Negroes doe not alwaies roaft In PhÃ¦bus Kitchin: nor the Hungars fight. The Tiuititias and th'Egyptians Beare, Their Vtensyles to trees but once a yeare. Amongst the scalie creatures is but one That neuer rests, the Dolphin musicks louer. Of beasts except the slaues poore Asse, theres none, Onely of birds Moluccaes plumy rouer: And of men, those that best themselues maintaine For God and vertue, these no peace here gaine. The numbers of their tribulations farre exceed The numbers of the busie swarmes that dwell In the Sarmatian Woods, or spawnes that breed In Neptunes mansions, or the Oceans shells: The number of their sorrowes doth surmount Th'Atlantique sands, or thoughts most swift account. These men resemble Forts beleagured strait, Without with fresh assaults, and batteries prest; Within by traytors, whom the foes faire bait, Tempt still to yeeld, to gaine a seeming rest From Sorrowes rage, which those men onely harmes That fight, but haue not Patience for their armes. Chap. XIIII. [For Sorrow like a tyrant fierce and keene] Description of Sorrow. For Sorrow like a tyrant fierce and keene, Destroyes all that this heauenly patience misse: For euery day she sifts them with fresh teene, And plowes them vp with her new miseries. And weares them, as the wheele the yeelding clay, Except they paue with patience euery day. Me thinks I gladly would to Sorrow frame A face, and giue it such a shape and forme, As once it had, that to my fansie came In darksome night, when sleepe was from me torne By boyling cares, that banisht from my brest Repose, and left my minds sick thoughts distrest. Me thought she was a woman lanke and bare, But yet composde of bones, and sinewes strong; Her hands and feet like Harpies, arm'd they were; Two sable wings vpon her shoulders hung: Her brest was glasse, halfe cleare, and halfe obscure: That shewed her heart, this formes false and impure. A Chaplet boare she on her head forlorne Of Oke growne Sorrow adornes her selfe with those things that signifie destruction, mixt with thorny cares that euer keepe her waking. Iuie, and of Cypresse bough, Wouen with the sharper twigs of the Black-thorne, To stay her dangling tresses, white as snow: The Mantle that she woare was wrought of Skins Of And, like the Sallamanders that extinguish fire, with the coldnesse of her melancholie disposition seemes to put out the fires of loue and merriment. Sallamanders, and of Shuns the light as the Bat, and as it were clothes her selfe in darknesse. Reremyce wings. Her eyes like toth' Making those shee lookes on with her eyes, heauy and lumpish. Hyena's eyes appeares: Her voice to Her discourse and conference being iust, as seasonable and pleasing, as the Screech-howles to any, but those that haue with her communitie of occasions. Screech owles, and to Mandrakes like; And of Those that are but afflicted with the losse of temporarie things, as health, friends, fortunes, or all these, with holy Iob, they seeme but to be a little benumbd only with the chastisment of her whip. Torpedoes skinne, a whip she beares In hand; wherewith what folke so ere she strike, Turne either Gold or Iron, But those which loose Gods grace, fauour and mercie, with Iudas, those shee seemes to kill, and vtterly to destroy with her Mace of Iron. Th'other hand A Deadly Mace of Iron doth command. Some of a hill in Iseland, Hecla tell, Plaste at Hel-mouth, because she leads either to despaire (who keepes at the entrance of hell) or else to Repentance by whom we passe, hard by the Gates of hell to heauen.Hels mouth for strang fires, &amp; lost soules plaints famd) Their in a caue of Feigned to liue in a Tombstone, or Sarchophage, because the house where sorrow doth inhabit, is to this flesh no better then a perpetuall consumption, and a graue. The stones calld Sarchophage are found in a Countrie of Asia, in a place called Sciros. Plinie. scyros stone's her Cell When shee's at home. Her Porter Losse is nam'd. Her page Desertion is.

Iam dolor in morem venit meus: vtque caducis Percussu crebro, saxa cauantur aquis, Sic ego continuo fortunÃ¦ vulneror ictu, Vix que habet in nobis iam noua plaga locum. Nes magis assiduo vomer tenuatur ab vsu: Nec magis est curuis Appia trita rotis, Pectora quam mea sunt serie calcata Malorum. âOuid. Now Sorrow to a habit's turn'd in me: For as the stones by often drops are cleft, So by th'incessant strokes of Fortune I Am wounded, and no place in me is left For newer wounds. The Plough-shares not more worne With daily vse, nor th'Appian way more torne With wheeles, then my brest with this tract of ills. Chap. XV. [I wish I could mans sorrows summe, and penne] The number of our sorrows which seeme infinite, till they be compared with the number of our sinnes, whose numberlesse number nothing exceeds but the infinite mercies of Almightie God. I wish I could mans sorrows summe, and penne, Bandied like balls, twixt faults and punishments, Whose punishments so close succeed his sinne, As shadows doe the substance, that fore-went Beautie, strength, wealth and wit, the gifts of heauen To be lost at these hazards, oft are giuen. The miseries and sorrowes, cares and feares, That here assault him euery day and howre, In number like the Russian swarmes appeare; In nature like the Tygers that deuoure; Or Nubian Lions, feeding on his heart, Disfiguring the face and euery part. The poysons wherewith they infest our minds, Tormenting more then all the banefull weeds That doe enrage or stupifie. The kinds Of Serpents, Dipsas, Drynas lesse paine breds: Mans owne hart to himselfe so much doth yeeld, Of sinnes and sorrowes the most fertill field. The number of which sorrowes doth surmount. (Excepting sinnes) all other terren things. The grasse, the leaues, the sand, in sinnes account: The scalie traine, and creatures that haue wings, Fall short, compared with this. Of numbers none Exceeds the number of our sinnes, but one. Gods mercies, which as Heauens bright tapers are, Or siluer dewes of Hermons fertill hill, More faire then Ormuz Pearle or Diamonds farre; More sweet then all the Balsams that distill Out of the Plants the Memphyan Gardens hold; Richer then Chyna's Mines, or Congian Gold. Gods mercies are as many as our words And thoughts: for euery word and thought is sin. Thence since each sinne, eternall death affords, And by his mercies these so oft forgiu'n; Who can Gods mercies infinite expresse, For boundlesse woes, who giues eternall blesse? Chap. XVI. [Gods mercies are the deluge of his loue] The great comfort in Gods excellent mercies, in which we may find rest after all our miseries. Gods mercies are the deluge of his loue: For as his Iustice once did ouerfloe, And sad destruction to the world did proue. So doth the deluge of his mercie now Flow freely ouer all men, and to all That for the same with constant faith do call. Not mightie Volga with her seuentie mouthes, Not Greekish Danow, on whose sides there stands Those regall Townes; not Nyger that by droughts Is twice deuoured of Affricks thirsting sands: Zayr, Nile, and Magnice, all vnited, are Not with this Riuers vastnes to compare. Not cleare Maragnon with her siluer waues, Not Rawleane, not Plate, which from the Mine Within Peruuian Mountaines intrals laues Rich Grauel (fearing sore the Ocean Queene, As emptie handed vassals to appeare:) These be not halfe so rich, nor halfe so cleare. The Brammenes, and the Heathen Indians, who In The Indians haue a superstitious conceit of Ganges, and thinke themselues much sanctified by washing therein, and giue great gifts to the poore. When they come on pilgrimage thereto. Hier. Xab. and they doe the like to the Riuer Indus. Ganges seeke their sinnes to wash, and clense, The vertues of this Riuer doe not know, Nor they that doe themselues in Indus rense. But we in this alone perfection find, Health, Beautie, Wealth, &amp; Bounty all combind. The Prophets and the holy Patriarchs Washt in this Iourdane, and therein found health: So did the Saints and Churches great Nauerches: And so doe we, who meete with no lesse wealth: All drinke, or may, for this is neuer drie, Because the Fountaine is Eternitie. Some of two Phrygian Fountaines tell strange things, Plin. lib. 30. cap. 2. Cleon and Gelon; th'one exciting teares, The other gladnesse. But two stranger Springs More opposite in humain flesh appeares; Sinne that both teares and death it selfe procures, And Mercy in Christs blood, which life assures. Chap. XVII. [Bvt hence appeares another Riuer now] The greatnesse of his Bountie. Bvt hence appeares another Riuer now Great as the former, which doth also spring From the same Fount, and doth as largely flow Through all this All, bedewing euery thing. Gods louing bounty which doth all things cherish, Which all things made, and all things stil doth nourish: Which to expresse an hundred tongues need I, Archimides his engines all are vaine: Plinie and Solinus report, that one Strabo from a promontorie of Sicily could see and count the ships setting forth of Carthage, distant eightie miles. So Linus, lib. 7. cap. 5. Plin. lib. 7. cap. 20. Strabo the hundred part could neuer see Of this great Riuer, which seemes such a Mayne, That Latitudes and Altitudes preuaile Nothing; to measur't all dimensions faile. The Macedonian Prince I call to mind, That thought not what he gaue, but what was meet. And diuers CÃ¦sars that vnto their friends, To part with Kingdomes haue reputed light But humaine bounties all too short they be; They giue their friends, Heauen giues his enemy. For God tho he fore-see, and well fore-know, That man his vassall will turne enemie, And a rebellious refractorie foe, Ingratefull fraught with deepe impietie: Yet for him frames this fabrick great and high, Full stored with blessings, crownd with roialtie. Oh boundlesse praise of true magnificence, That doth not seeke his foes to ouercome By force, but to reclaime them, and conuince By bounties, and by benefits alone: And to that end doth euery day vs proue, With streames of gifts, to win vs to his loue. With many a present doth he hourely woe vs, From euery danger charie to defend: Much like a wounded louer seemes he to vs; Tho wretched we neglect our dearest friend, Which doth at no peculiar profit aime. What's lost we loose: if ought be gaind, we gaine. Chap. XVIII. [Oh that my Muse could on her nimblest wings] The same bountie further enlarged. Oh that my Muse could on her nimblest wings, Mount you aloft beyond the foggy aire, Past the reflection of all terrene things, And sublimate your soules to things more faire; That touching these terrestriall beauties, we Might rather, heare, thinke why, then what they be. First, what a spatious and maiestick Hall, Full of officious seruants for your vse, Hath Heauen ordained to entertaine you all? Wherein if any want, tis but th'abuse Of foule excesse, whose surfets wasts the store, That might supply the needies wants twice ore. With what a downie Carpet hath he spread The flowrie earth, to entertaine your feete; Where euery plant and flowre that shewes his head, Brings with it profit, wonder and delight? How many a pretty flie with spotted wing, Vpon there slender stalkes their Canzons sing? How many fruitfull Champains feeding flocks? How many beautious Forrests clad in greene Where watry Nimphes with soft embraces locks; Such shadie Groues, as for true Loue may seeme Fit Chappels (to the winged singers layes, And burbling streames) to chaunt true Beauties praise. Yet more he lodges in earths secret vaines, Ten thousand things of farre more valued prise; And th'Sea for pleasure, and for vse conteines The choisest beauties, richest smells, and dies. Thus hath our Maker for touch, tast and smell, For Eie and Eare; puruey'd compleatly well. But man himselfe alone must feed the mind, And contemplation onely cooks the dish. What is it then? Hath Heauen all these assigned For our vse, to that end we should be his? Then must we giue him one poore little part, (The onely thing he craues) A thankefull heart. Chap. XIX. [If from a friend some trifle we receiue] His Benificence. If from a friend some trifle we receiue Some bracelet, gloues, or some such common thing; We thinke our selues ingratefull, if we leaue These vnrequired; and can we lesse bring To him, which giues vs all that we possesse, Then the poore hearts true loue, and thankfulnesse? How can his roiall bounties be exprest? The things ordained for ornament and vse; The various fare prepar'd to feast his guests; Where each one for his appetite may chuse. Oh who can count the various kinds of creatures, Their wondrous shapes their colours &amp; their features! Ten thousand flocks that ore our heads still houers, Which daily seeme to bid vs kill and eate: Ten thousand fruits, which time to vs discouers; Ten thousand plants, and rootes, and seeds for meate: The sculles, Oh Lord, of all the Lakes, &amp; Fountaines, The Heards are thine vpon ten thousand mountaines. Ten thousand creatures for delight assignd, Ten thousand stones that precious vertues hold, Ten thousand flowers to recreate the mind, Ten thousand healthfull Drugs more worth then Gold; Ten thousand more then I can sum or count: Thy blessings Lord, all tongues and wits surmount. And euery blessing is so double blest, That they not onely food for vs containe, But bounteous Nature locks within the least Of these, some helpe for our disease and paine. One thing sometimes hath such varietie, That many pretious vertues hidden lie. For all which, God requires but thankfulnes; Tho thanklesse we too often not agnize The author of these benefits of his, But either Chance, or Natures gifts them prize: For those that with these blessings most abound, Are commonly the most ingratefull found. Chap. XX. [Me thinkes it were enough if God did giue] His Magnificence not onely affording things necessary, but heaping his benefits vpon vs with so great varietie, that the vnderstanding of man cannot vtter it. Me thinkes it were enough if God did giue But bread and water to his enemies, And some one kind of food to make vs liue Temperate, and secured from Luxuries; And not to frame so many thousand kinds Of bread, of vyands, and of tempting wines? Cuba her Iucca vaunts, Peru her Mayze: Pegue and rich Cambaya theirs of Rice. Congo her bread of This Luco is a little small graine, round like musterd-seed, which makes bread not inferior to our Wheate. Hist. congo. Luco's graine doth praise, And Palme-tree fruite. Guynee no lesse doth prize Her bread of rootes, Inama tearm'd by them: But Heauen faire Europ crownes with the best graine. Italy vaunts Falerne, and Setyne wine; Germany Rhennish, Claret France, Spaine Sack; Candie and Cyprus their's of Muskadine, Greece hath her Chyan, India Palme and Rack. Drie Ferrall, one of the Canarie Ilands, hath no water in it, but that which drops from the leaues of one onely tree: for ouer the top of this tree there houers continually a moist cloud, by Gods appointment, from whence the tree receiues this aboundant moisture for the benefit of men and beasts. Linschott. Ferrall her Heauens-dew-distilling tree: Turkey her Coffa; Corne made Wines haue we. Me thinks our Maker had great bountie showne, If he our nakednes such clothes had giuen As our first Parents had (from Eden throwne:) But he hath made the little flies to spin, And many a beast to yeeld their haire &amp; wooll, And trees, and plants, from whence more soft we cull. Me thinks for beggers too it had been faire, One onely kind to haue of Wood and Stone, To build defensiues for the Winter ayre: But who can count the kinds of any one? Oke, Cedar, Cypresse, This wood called Teyxo, is a stranger in these parts, growing onely in the Iland Terceara, a tree of marueilous largenesse, and the wood exceeding hard, red within and waued, with an admirable beautie. This is not cut but for the King of Spaine himselfe. Teyxo, Ebony, A thousand sorts of Marble, Porphery. Me thinks againe one beast were well for ease: But drie Arabia (that doth water want) Hath the moyst Cammell. Danzieks frozen Seas, The sprightfull Elland. The huge Elephant Our Maker vnto fruitfull Inde assignes: The little dock fed Asse to barren Climes. Chap. XXI. [For Gods most compleate bountie not content] No place emptie, and vnfurnisht of Creatures for Mans behoofe, but all full without scarcitie, or scant, to this end, that man for this fulnesse and bountie of externall things, might returne a proportionate fulnesse in his affections towards God, which bestowes all this vpon him. For Gods most compleate bountie not content With such a single liberalitie, Therefore this great varietie hath lent; As much abhorring poore vacuitie And indigence, in all his workes diuine, Which all with compleat bounteous fulnes shine, The Riuers and the Seas be full of fish; The earth is full of trees, of grasse, of plants, And full of creatures fram'd to feed on this; The ayre is full of her inhabitants, All things on earth doe of this fulnes share; No emptie place: all fild with virall ayre. But man may sooner loose himselfe in quest, And suruey of these blessings manifold, Much sooner, then discouer in the least, The seuerall gifts and vertues that they hold: For in the least so many worths we find, As much surmount mans weak sin darkned mind. How many seuerall gifts hath the Maguayze? How many hath Maldiuars fruitfull tree? Which are as foyles to beautie, and praise Our plenties infinite varietie? One tree doth them with all abundance store, And sweet content, and all ours can no more. Yet here with vs some one thing seeme to stand In stead of thousands: As the Sheepe and Cow. This brings the Oxe, that tills and fats the land, That warmely clothes vs. This our feere doth shoo, And with their flesh and milke the most are fed, But milk's the poore mans Phisick, meat, drink, bread. And why's this fulnes? for this end alone, That Man for fulnes of things naturall, Should returne fulnesse in affection; Fulnesse of Loue and Grace spirituall: For if in these there be vacuitie, True Motion, Essence, Light, Life none can be. Chap. XXII. [Now all tongues being dumbe, and lame, t'expresse] But Man returnes his Maker nothing but ingratitude. Now all tongues being dumbe, and lame, t'expresse The smallest part of this his bounties streame; What haue we to returne but thankfulnesse, That in ourselues, so naked are and meane? We haue no light, but what thou Lord dost giue; The Ayre is thine by which we breath and liue. Mans thankfulnesse should next in sight appeare, A full streame to this bountie parralell, But not the smallest torrent runs there here, Therefore of his ingratitude I tell. A streame that with the largest may compare, That in our Natures troubled Fountaines are. Who would beleeue a beggar base, and poore, Aduanst by much indulgence of a King, Euen from the dung-hill, or the Namely, that of Beeing, the most common trance into this work-house of Nature. lowest doore, To be a creature noble flourishing, Could for such benefits become ingrate, And traytor where he owes his life and state? But man in his affections is like winde, And sooner varied to contrary parts; Vnkind, and most ingratefull; fickle friend, Not constant enemie. Their wauering harts Possest with foule desires, and fond respects, Still making warre against their intellects. Oh thou who didst in deepest darknesse know vs, And didst of nothing this our essence frame! God, that from nothing gaue a beeing to vs, A beeing fit the fairest to attaine: Not fixt like Plants, nor brutish led by sence, But ruled by Reasons right intelligence. The perfect image of thy selfe who made vs, And with free powre, and principalitie, Ouer this little world at first arrayd vs, So long as we by Reason rul'd would be, Why to rebellion should thy blessings moue vs, And to be still ingrate to those that loue vs? Chap. XXIII. [In vaine, in vaine on our moralitie] Mans Ingratitude peruerts the very benefits themselues, to be instruments of displeasing him that gaue them, still presuming, that because hee sees not God, therefore God sees not him. In vaine, in vaine on our moralitie Towards men we stand; and falsely doe we vaunt Our constancie, and our integritie, Thankfulnes, honestie: for the maine want Of these things towards God doth plainely proue That men haue not true friendship, nor true loue. Who friends vs? Is not God our greatest friend? Who loues vs? Is not Gods loue infinite, That for our sakes his Sonne to death did send? We dote on fading Beautie, and praise Light; Glory rapes vs, Riches all affect: Yet true Light, Beautie, Glorie, Wealth neglect. The louer striues to make the loued one And same thing with it selfe, if it may be: So perfect Loue, our God that lookes vpon Our wretched state with gracious clemency. First clothes our flesh with gifts of various kinds, Hoping that we with Loue should clothe our minds. Perfect Light, giues light and beeing to vs: Perfect Beautie giues vs comlie forme: Glorie doth with dignitie endow vs; And wealth with plentie doth our wants adorne. Perfect Loue giues loue, and all to win Our loues: yet hence (too oft) our hates begin: We hate the light that doth our faults bewray. For Beautie euery day our soules we sell: Glorie doth thousands to the graue betray; But Riches sends her millions downe to Hell: And we for each crosse that in these we haue, Hate that Loue, which to win our loue them gave. Yet loues he more: and whereas we are poore And naked in our soules, or much worse clad; He daily followes vs, t'impart his store, Tho still we shun him (of our rags more glad,) And like our Grandsyre Adam, thinke to be Hidden from his eye, that doth all things see: Chap. XXIIII. [Th'vntainted Sunne doth Guanoes dung behold] Gods Omniscience, from whose all-piercing eye nothing is hidden. Th'vntainted Sunne doth Guanoes dung behold, As well as Perues pleasant fertill land. And low priz'd Marle, as well as splendant Gold, Which faire Maragnon with her friendly hand, Doth borrow from the rich Guianaes shore, To woe her Brittaine louers ouer to her: The Sunne to euerie secret corner pries, And sees as well the nastie nookes, and sincks, And loathsome vaults, where murther often lies Conceald, till it pollutes the aire with stincks; As well as Marble Temples, that are blest With all the pride of Art and Natures best. Then shall not Gods soule piercing beames discouer, Much more the secret turpitude of things, For which his vengeance ore our heads doth houer? Yes, yes: He sees what subiects doe, and Kings; He sees the sceanes of lust, and philtrous spells, And deeds of darknesse seene by no eyes else. He sees the tyrant Kings that doe oppresse His truths defendors, and with lies betray The liues of his two faithfull Witnesses, Exposing their dead And their corpses shall lie in the streets of the great Citie, which spiritually is called Sodom, and Ãgypt.

Ioseph. Acosta. Hist. Ind. lib. 4. cap. 37. Chap. XXV. [Bvt because God with patience sees all this] Gods Patience, of which Man hath euer a perverse consideration, abusing this as he doth all the rest, to his owne destruction. Bvt because God with patience sees all this, And suffers vs run on in our owne way, Vntill some time that predetermind is. The wretched and vnwise in heart, they say There is no God; or else he sees not vs, Because our sinnes scape still vnpunisht thus: But know fond man Heauen differs much from thee In the consideration and esteeme Of the maine things. Of Place, of Quantitie, Of Time, of Motion, mortalls oft misdeeme, And oftest erre; because by sence we count, Which still is lame in obiects that surmount. Sense tells vs, that the Sunnes diameter Is but a span: but Reason rectified, Shewes it transcends earths quantitie so far, That scarce proportion twixt them doth recide. Sence thinks an arrow swifter then the Sunne, Tho this a thousand mile each minute runne. And the like errors there in Time appeares, Because Gods iudgements doe not light vpon The sensuall man perchance for some few yeares: He laughs at iudgement, and beleeues there's none; He thinks an age so long: but sound men see All times are nothing to eternitie. Audacious men! How dare we then prouoke Our Iudge, that holds vs in so strong a Iayle? By Sampsons strength might Sampsons bonds be broke. False Eason with Medeah might preuaile. But here alas a tripple wall vs curbs, Of Flesh, of Fire, and th'Adamantine Orbes. Then whether can we flie? a thousand eyes Attend vs. If to the worlds vtmost bound; There ore our heads, we find Gods watchfull spies; In Hell his executioners are found. All flight is vaine, saue to himselfe alone: For he that breaks Iayle, to the dungeons throwne. Chap. XXVI. [Bvt why (because Gods Patience doth deferre] The infinite clemencie of Almightie God, Who staies and expects our repentance so long, since the Scripture testifies of him, that he is a consuming fire. Bvt why (because Gods Patience doth deferre Our punishment, expecting our amends) Why should we hence grow bolder still to erre, But rather much more fearefull of offence? The wretch repriu'd prouokes not's Iudge, but rather Striues to be reguler, to win more fauour. Yet we each day, each day and minute, we Incessantly prouoke the Iudge Diuine: Because our blind-fold nature doth not see The beames of Iustice, that in him doe shine; And flames that flow from his incensed ire, Who is indeed a swift consuming Our Lord (saith Saint Paul) is a consuming fire, Heb. 12. Fire. The Seraphins from fire receiue this name, Because enflamde with Elias enflamed also with this diuine loue, assended to heauen in a Chariot of fire. 2. Kin. 2. 9. loue diuine they are. To Moses thus appeard he in the flame: Mount Sinay smok't when he in fire was there. Now God being fire, and we being in him, How good is he that burnes not when we sinne? There is a Miraculous fires, such as that of Sidrach, Misach and Abdenego, and others of holy Martyrs that haue not burnt for the time. fire that doth forbeare to burne Things that thereto by nature subiect be: And Cetterum mira fulminis, si intueri velis, opera sunt, nee quicquam [illeg.] reliquentia, quin diuina insit illis &amp; subtilis potentia.

Seneca natural. quest. cap. 31. fire that from the drie thin wood doth turne, Yet melts the steele containd in't instantly. The like's in God, who spares the yeelding things, And vnto ruine all resistants brings. And as fire wastes the Stubble, Hay and Wood, But purifies Gold, Siluer, pretious Stones; So doth the fire of Gods loue in the good Consume lusts, and vnlawfull passions, Which are as stubble; but doth purifie Bright shining Zeale, Deuotion, Charitie. And th'Iron hearted Sinners that doe seeme The properties of Iron.Black, cold, and stiffe before they feele this fire; The fire of Gods loue makes them turne in time, Light, hot, and pliable to his desire: Or else his fires of Iustice lightning like, Consumes them in the time ordaind to strike. Chap. XXVII. [The manner of the Pagans was t'adore] The Pagans for the benefits of Heate and Lightâ worshipt the Sunne and Fire. The manner of the Pagans was t'adore Chiefly those things did hurt or benefit. The Memphians worship th'author of their store, Great Nilus, cause their fields were fained by't. Sidonians to the gainefull Sheepe did bow, As th'Indians doe to beasts and deuill. now. But the wise Persians they did worship fire, For the great benefits of heate and light: And all the Nations ioyntly did conspire To worship Titan, vanquisher of night; Who, when he doth his splendant beames display, Soone chases dreadfull darksome night away. Th'vnweldy Germaines this, the nimble Daeians, The prudent Chaldeans this, &amp; rude Barbarians; The noble Grecians this, and barbarous Thrasian; The rich Egyptians, and the poore Tartarians; All worship light; to this erected Phanes, And Ex [illeg.] Solem veneranter cui equos immolant, hic autem est neos sacrificandi, vt deorum pernicissimo Ã© quadrupedibus omnibus pernicissimuns mactent. Herodot. Clyo. swift Steads brought to swifter Titans For heauenly light distinguishes each thing: The sound from sicke, the foolish from the sage: But night knowes not the seruant from the King, Not Gold from Lead, nor youth from crooked age; The Sun burnt Moore scorcht on the Libian sand, From those most faire on Thames or [illeg.] strand, Night is the nurce of feare, to fraude the furtherer, A time for shadowes and for beasts of pray; A baude to lust, a cloke vnto the murtherer: No friend to Innocence, which loues the day, And rises vp to labour in the morne, When beasts of prey backe to their dens returne. Who maruels now that Pagans Idolize The Fire and Sunne, for gifts of heate and light? But whol not wonder, that our dimmer eyes See not a Light ten thousand fold more bright? A Light that to the Sunne his light assignes; And more, illumines our sinne-darkned minds? Chap. XXVIII. [This bodies darknesse is no little griefe] Yet the darknesse of meere naturall mens minds is such, that they cannot see the true Light. God which giues the Sunne and Fire their Light. and is himselfe the light of Wisdome, and the warmth of Charitie. This bodies darknesse is no little griefe, But darknesse of the mind doth farre excell: And that Light that brings this sad nights reliefe, And shewes the way from Sorrow, Death and Hell; Why leads not blind-fold Nature vnto him, That with one beame lets so much comfort in? Alas we're blind, and cannot this Sunne see: For though the Sunne doe ne'er so clearely shine, If th'instruments of sight defectiue be, In darknesse deepe we languish still, and pine: So wanting th'eye of Faith to see this Light, We blame the Sunne, and call the noone-day, night. And herein is that darknesse more accurst Of th'vnderstanding, then the senses farre: For (this defectiue) we're content to trust A friend to guide vs, lest our steps should erre: But that most wretched calls the darknesse day, And (shewd the light) in darknesse striues to stay. And why's this? cause we trust the sence alone, And this light through the sences neuer past. The Eyes no obiects haue, but bodies knowne: To speake of light vnseene, to th'sence is wast: But vnbeleeuing man that doest agnize, Onely things obuious to thy sence and eyes. When hast thou seene the Ayre at any time, The chiefe sustaining meanes by which we liue? Or thine owne soule, whose beauties clearer shine (More splendant beames) then fading earth can giue? For each thing is more noble in degree, As'ts freer from Materialitie. Water therefore's aboue th'condensed dust, Ayre aboue that, then th'element of fire: Then th'Orbes tralucent Most incorporeall of bodies; because of tralucent so many hundred thousand miles, tho of Adamantine haranesse.

Lastly, th'Angels that aspire Nearest that incorporeall Sunne aboue, That giues the light of wisdome warmth of loue. Chap. XXIX. [You Nations then that starres and fire inuoke] Gods Wisdome.

All Lights are darknesse else; no other light Can guide your steps from errors dismall night. Come then: but when to see this light you come. You must doe like those that behold the Sunne. Looke on some third thing that reflects the skies, Because two vehement obiects spoyle the eyes. The Bashawes in the Turkish presence bow Their heads, and bend their eyes to th'earth downe loe, Fearing to gaze too freely on their Prince. Then shall we dare more then the Seraphins? They to behold this Light in highest place, Doe interpose their wings before his face, Not able so great glories to behold. Then shall we wretched mortals (farre more bold) Gaze full vpon those beames that make vs blind? No let vs for this weake eie of the mind, Find some reflecting mirror (as we doe For th'sences) that t'our intellect may show (As in a glasse) the shadow of this light; For this it selfe is in it selfe too bright, For creatures to behold of so low state. We haue a glasse, a glasse of things create, Wherein this wisdome doth so clearely shine, That euery eye may see this light diuine. Therefore in this glasse of the creatures, we The glorie of our Maker best may see; Who infinite, vnbounded, vnconteynd, Himselfe in limits, yet hath all things fram'd By number, weight and measure: for both Heauen, Earth, Sea, Sun, Moone, the Stars, the Planets seuen: The Elements, Men, Beasts and Plants we find, In these termes and dimensions all confind. The Heauens in reuolution iumpe with time, No accident doth ere their course decline From their first order. Such proportion Of magnitude assignd to euery one, And distance, that if ought herein were chang'd From order, the whole frame were quite estrang'd From goodnesse, and pernitious to men. But this is not ordaind alone to them: The little Bees and Ants therewith are blest. Such true proportion both in man and beast, Of weight and measure, in each member plac't, And euery part with such true number grac't, That if therein the least transgression be, It brands the creature with deformitie: God giues to man one head, two hands, two feete; If any where this orders changd, we meet A Monster. If the Nose, or Mouth, or Eare Be fram'd too large; they make the whole appeare Vncomely. What an vniformitie In Flowers and Fruits, in Seeds and Leaues we see? Fram'd with such euennes (that oft-times our sight Cannot distinguish) all with number, weight And measure. And what can the wisdome show Of our great Maker, more then this, to know The number, weight and measure of each part? Shall not he know the motions of the heart? He knowes the number of our steps and haires; Shall not he know our secretest affaires, And close affections? He the drops of raine, And of the Sands that on the shores remaine, The number knowes. And tell me; shall not he The number of our words and actions see? Yes: For his Wisdome yet farre more appeares, In that he at one instant sees, and heares The actions, thoughts, and words of euery man. Mans lame imperfect knowledge hardly can By many acts discoursing too and fro; Scarcely attaine (not fully come) vnto The knowledge of some one thing. But this King By one act, sees himselfe, and euery thing That Heauen and Earth containes. But now we come To th'weight and measure of perfection. This Earth (for which men striue so much) we deeme Compar'd with Gold and Iems of small esteeme. But these, compar'd with things that life can saue, Farre sleighter, and much lower value haue. The beasts, that haue the benefit of sence, Of sencelesse creatures haue preheminence: But men endued with reasons facultie, Obtaine a splendor farre more cleare and high: Yet these, compared with those cleare minds aboue, Whom no foule appetites of sences moue, Are poore and low. How great diuersitie Of weight and measure is in dignitie? In mens estates, and callings here on earth? Some wise, some weake, some meane, and low by birth; Others noble; some indigent and poore, Others swelling with abundant store. But in the most, mans weake opinion erres: For tho the state of pouertie appeares Irksome, and heauy vnto earthly minds, The holy soule therein aduantage finds: For wealth's a snare that doth our soules betray; But want's a tutor, whips vs to the way, That leads vnto eternall happines: So that these present discommodities, Returne in time an ample recompence: When the faire guilded sweets of oppulence, Repay their weight in bitternes and gall. Oh how inscrutable are his workes all? Who can declare the secret simpathies? The hidden causes of antiphathies. Who can expresse the wondrous properties Of Plants and Beasts, their hidden qualities? How many excellencies each where dwells, Within the fabrick of these earthen cells? For of the fairer faculties of mind (The mind's reflected knowledge darke and blind, With such imperfectnes it selfe doth view) We iustly doubt, if what we know, be true. Tho most we find our imbecillitie, In contemplation of that Maiestie; Which like a Falkon through the high clouds towres, Where we come tardy with these wings of ours. Chap. XXX. [His Power againe as hard a taske I find] His Power. His Power againe as hard a taske I find (For infinite can neuer be confind To place, or number) worke too hard and high, To shew his powre that rules both earth and skie; To whom the Saints and Angels all obey; To whom the Lampes that rule both night &amp; day: For he their Maker, and their Mouer is. Nor doe they runne their proper course, but his.

The Tygers and the Lions that deuoure All things at th'becke of this transcendent powre Turne tame and gentle. The great King of Deepes That euery thing to's hungry Shambles sweepes; When this Powre list, must their his Prophet saue. The cruell Tyrant that delights to haue His bloody will, when God in power commands, Puts vp his sword, and lends his helping hands. The wretched Powres infernall, whose curst will Swifter then lightning moue to doe man ill, Are yet preuented by the swifter speed Of this Powre, who is ready still at need, To helpe the faithfull. But this Powre most cleare, And infinitely powrefull doth appeare In the production of his creatures all. For what's of greater wonder, then the small And slender seeds that mightie things produce? No man (whose vnderstanding's most obtuse) Can chuse but wonder, how the bole and high Towre topping branches of the Oke, should lie Within the little Akornes seed contain'd, Those engins where with Neptunes force is tam'd. Ist not as strange that watry substance, thin And flewent, should be matter to begin The timber-buildings of the mightie Whale, The monstrous The Rhoyder is a Fish in the Iland Seas one hunderd and thirtie ells long (much larger then the largest kind of Whales) their flesh good to eate and medicinable.

Or that the offices of life in Bees And Ants, is as accomplisht as in these? These haue their stomack, liuer, heart and gall, Their instruments of sence and motion, all The parts of generation as compleat, As haue those massie buildings huge and great: Whose mightie beames and transome few behold Without amazement. If it should be told To some that knew it not, would they not smile To thinke, the bullet scorning Crocodilus fluuiatilis oua 60. quam plurimum parit, viuitque diu, maximumque animal minima hac origins euadit. ouum enim non maius quam anseris, &amp; fÅtus inde exclusus proportione est: atramen crescit ad quindecem cubita.

This Powre no lesse we see In contemplating that varietie Of seuerall formes in earth, in sea, and aire, Of which the cunningst Artists not declare The smaller part of what vnknowne they leaue. How various are the seuerall shapes they haue? How various is their food and preseruation? Their waies of breed and generation? Quantities, qualities, their voyces soundes, Their benefits that vnto man redounds? This is a Sea which Reason clogd with sence Cannot swim ouer: but this power immense Is fairest written in the Heauens aboue. With what incessant swiftnes doe they moue? Yet measured and obseruing still that time, Which first they did before they ere had seene Mans guiltines; and (if God pleased) might be Continued so to all eternitie. But in how short a moment is the cleare Sunnes light transfused throughout the Hemyspheare? To this the lightning's flow; and the swift wind And th'ayrie wings to phansies powres assignd. Nothing's more strange contered in Natures store: Nor that the Deitie resembles more. How highly in this Creature are we blest, The Sunne, that life preserues in man and beast? Who by attenuation doth forth call The blew Mists from their Mother Thetis Hall.

This doth well declare His power, by whom they fram'd and gouernd are. But what speakes more his powre then this? he fram'd Both Heauen and Earth, and all things there contain'd Of nothing; all without precedent stuffe To build on: for his owne word was enough. The cunning Painter many yeares will stick Vpon some one rare piece, and errors pricke, Expunge and race, before the worke be done, A thousand times, to giue perfection Onely to shadowes. But th'Creator made Their substances of nothing, and arraide Them all with true perfection with a word; His onely Word their essence did afford. God did command the Heauens and Earth to be, And they were made. With like facillitie The Angels, Sunne and Moone that guides the night; Plants, Beasts and Men, this Word prodeust to light. And as one Word did all this All create; So must one Word, all this All dissipate. Tho man, thus dissipated (in despight Of Death, and Hell, and of corruptions might; In spight of Time and Tyrants that disseuer Our members) must vnited be together: From thence before the mightie Iudge to goe, That giues the doomes of endlesse ioyes, or woe.

Thus man with earth compard, As nothing doth appeare; And Earth with Heau'n declard, As if it nothing were. But th'Heauens Oh God to thee, Are least of all in sight: For lesse then nothing be, Finites to Infinite. Nothing of nothing's now: How bold are we that dare, Such minds Gigantiue show, With Heauen to bandy warre? The Lions are more stout, The Elephants more strong; The arm'd Rhynoceret Much more secure from wrong. The Crocodiles for warre, And Tortoyse fitter be: The Congian The Zibraes are by some Authors counted very swiftZibraes are, And Dant eiusmodi fertur esse celeritate vt cursu feras omnes anteuertat Equos suos empturi vel vendituri [illeg.] fÃ¦rÃ¦ [illeg.] probant Arabes.Scel. exer.206, pars.5. Dantes more swift then we: The Whales are larger syzed, Th'Apodes lesse desire. The Vnicornes more prized, Pirausta safe from fire. The Okes liue longer farre, The CÃ¦dars be more tall; The Lillies whiter are, The Roses sweeter all. Man is the weakest still, The wretchedst, and the worst; Hath least meanes to doe ill, Yet then the rest more curst: For they to Natures Law Are subiect and confind. But nothing keepes in awe, His bad vnstable mind. The Tyger's not so keene, So bloodie not the Bore; The Aspe so full of teen, So fell the Mantichore; So lustfull not the Goat, So slothfull not the Beare. So proud the Horse doth not, Nor Iunoes fowle appeare. The Dragon for reuenge, For enuy he the Dog; And Fox for craft transcends, For beastlines the Hog. A Tunny to deuoure, A Hawke to seeke his pray; A This Whirlepoole (otherwise called a Phiseter) and by some taken to be the Whale, drawes in so much water, that when he spouts the same forth againe, hee is therewith able to ouerset and drowne ships, pli.l.9.e.4. Whirlepoole in to powre, A A Cayman is the same that a Crocodile. Caymanto betray. How vile a thing is this, That all things which are ill, In Plants, in Beasts, or Fish, We amply doe excell: But indigent in all, That we in beasts commend; We onely, more then all, Our Maker still offend? Chap. XXXII. [Oh God how blest were we] Faire without, foule within. Oh God how blest were we, If (as our limbes are white) There might like candor be, In mind compleate and right) But therein are we crosse, Black, vgly, crooked still, Turning our gaine to losse, Through fond depraued will, The pollisht Iuorie, Brought from thee Taprobane, Or [illeg.] cut from thee, Congoe, or Mauritane, With Pearle of rich Perue, Faire Ormuz, Cameron, May not compare their hew, Nor whitenesse with Sylon. The pure white Syndon spunne, By Brittaine Virgins here, Or by the Belgick Nunne, To Lillies browne appeare. And Lymster thy pure Fleece, Drest by thy rustick Swaines, (Tho rich as that of Greece) No luster it retaines, Compared with Atlas Snowes, Or Douers Chalkie. Hill, Which so repugnant showes, To Amphythrytes will. But Man that is as faire In outside, as the best, Wich what shall I compare His darksome sable brest? For tho he loue the light, And beautie doe admire, And most in things delight, Which Nature doth attire In this celest all hew, Whereof himselfe doth vaunt, (Despising both the Crow, And cole-black Cormorant) Yet he to whitenes still Doth offer most offence, To whitenesse that excels, To snow white Innocence. And tho vpright he goe, And groueling all the rest; Yet he in mind doth shoe, More crooked then the beast. The Cedar he commends, So goodly, tall and streight: And Pine that neuer bends, But beares his top vpright; But ne'er obserueth how Himselfe by Nature fram'd Vpright and streight to goe (As one to Heauenwards aim'd,) In mind doth still decline, To Earth still downewards bent, More then the Dog, or Swine, Whom Natures lawes content; Things proper them suffice For appetite and need. But man with Heauen this Flesh, His Soule with earth would feed, Improperties delight Him best, in his desires; For like is fed with like, But he vnlike requires. Chap. XXXIII. [How wretched, and how vaine] Wee praise substances, but pursue shadowes. How wretched, and how vaine Are Mortalls, that refuse True substances to gaine, And shadowes onely chuse? Pigmalion like we doe On pictured beautie dote. Like Rhodian Youthes we woe The shadowes, that are not, And substances despise, Tho fitter to be lou'd The things beneath the skies, By Mortals most approu'd; For which our soules we sell. Are Beautie, Wealth, and Fame. For these we visit Hell, And Plutoes firie raigne. For these we hourely part With Ease, with Health and Friends; For these we make a mart Of Liues and Innocence. And what is Beautie now That thus the mind can fire? That makes vs languish so, And pine with fond desire? An accidentall thing, A type and shadow bare, Of that Almightie King, Whose beauties substance are On Men not onely plac't: For many thousand be, Both Beasts and Plants high grac't Therewith in their degree. And what is Wealth for which We toyle, and hazard still? It makes vs not more rich Nor happie. Heauens high will Hath not these things confind To Measure, nor to weight; But plac't them in the mind. Content makes all things streight, Euen in the greatest want. But base Desire, opprest With heapes of wealth, feeles scant, Is poore, and cannot rest. Much poorer thing is Fame, Peruuian Ayrelesse light; Tis but a heauenly name, In earthly raggs bedight; And base Plebeyan breath, Which oft on wings doth raise The lumps of worthlesse earth, But spots faire vertues praise With black and vgly feere. Now which of these is best? Imperfect all in sight And shadowes all exprest? Glorie, Wealth, Beautie, lent To men, bare shadowes be, In Earth but accidents, In Heauen essentially. Earths glorie doth appeare Of Heauen, a type most bare: And Wealth that we haue here, With that must not compare. Beautie terrestriall, In beasts or men combin'd, In Earths rich Minerall, Or what's to earth assign'd. The beautious Planets seuen, The glorious Sunne and Moone; The Azure studded Heauen, Nights still companion: All these one picture frame Of beautie, that's immense; Beautie which man may name, But not conceiue by sense; Though our depraued mind, Still fading things pursue, VVhich we but shadowes find, Yet loose the substance true. Chap. XXXIIII. [Who can enough complaine] We follow gaine, not goodnesse. Who can enough complaine On humane dilligence? This Zeale of ours for gaine, It breeds my great offence. Too short's the longest day, Too long the shortest night, Desires brooke not delay, But crost, no peace admit, The Raine, the Frost, and Snow, And Tempests of the Ayre; These neuer make vs bow, If gaine be our affaire. For profit we doe saile Amongst the fleeting Ice; T'encounter with the Whales And Beare, we are not nice. And in these places strange, We seeke the [illeg.] shole; Both Lands and Seas we range, Neere to the frozen Pole: Then to the burning Line, And Affricks Desarts drie, Where many thousands pine, And perish wilfully; Where by the Sunne and Wind, They Mummey doe become. Yet we, with this in mind, To th'same misfortunes run. How small a thing doth man In magnitude appeare, Compar'd with Seas and Land. As if he nothing were? But all this earthly ball, Both Earth and Seas vast frame, To mans desires more small Doe seeme, then he to them. If profit may redound, No dangers doth he doubt. How oft he circles round, This massie frame about? The Currents, Sands and Rocks, The Typhons and Ternades, The falling Spouts he mocks, And Monsters that inuades: The flying Fires that seeme By th'Winds attrition bred: The Waues which some would deeme, The Graues where hope lies dead: The Tempests, and the Stormes, Death and Diseases, all Triumphantly he scornes, If profit may befall. For this he trauels both By day, and darksome night, No labour doth he lothe, Or Office thinke vnmeet. For this he Marts frequents, And place where pleadings be, (Which wise men are content To haue: but seldome see.) Amongst the fooles he gapes, And hunts about for pelfe: But knowes not that he takes Paines to condemne himselfe. If to Gods house he goe But once or twice a weeke, And spend an houre or two, How oft he falls asleepe? How long he thinkes the time? His soule is at his Farme, His Ship, his Shop, the Wine, Or on his neighbours harme. How great alacritie, And chearefulnesse of mind In worldly things shew we? In these how dull and blind? One houre to holy workes, And meditation lent, More troubles and more irkes, Then yeeres in ill mis-spent. Therefore this trauell great, For things terrene and base; This labour, and this sweat Must one day come in place; VVhere Iustice in her scale, These times and workes shall lay, To see which will preuaile, The darknes, or the day. Oh let vs then be wise, And couer riches true: These onely fill your eyes, But nothing profit you. Chap. XXXV. [Pleasure, how great a VVitch] We dote on earthly pleasures, and in them vainely pursue Happines, Which indeed are not so much as shadowes of the true Ioyes and Happinesse aboue. Pleasure, how great a VVitch Art thou to humane minds The potent and the rich, In seruile chaines thou binds. Not Epicurus Bowers, Nor th'charmed cups of [illeg.], Alcynous Founts and Flowers, Nor Antiochian Daphnay; Not [illeg.] flowrie Groues, Nor ancient Bayas plenty, Amara whom Heauen loues, Nor blest Arcadian Tempe, VVhich whilom were belieued Thy Parents (Pleasure) where Thy strength thou first atchiued, And where thou fosterdst were. These doe not now confine Thy Seruice, nor thy Psalter; Augmented much with time, The whole world is thine Altar; VVhere fond ingratefull men, Giue vp their hearts and minds To transitorie things, VVhich Heauen to vs assignes: But not intending we Should these for Gods adore, VVorking idolatrie VVith creatures base and poore. But with intent, that these Characters of his loue, Our minds to thankfulnesse And Loue, should frame and moue: For this the Plants and Rootes, And Seeds to earth assign'd; The Fish, the Foule, the Fruits, And Beasts of various kind, Are sent in place, and time, That best his needs may fit; And euery sort of VVine To warme, and cheare the wit: The Simples for health sent, The Silke, the VVooll and Skynne, The Iemins for ornament. Are all t'allure, and wiune, Mans heart to loue and feare That Lord, which these conferr. But he then saluage Beare, Or Tyger saluager; Once of the gift possest, The Giuer quite forgets. His soule in these seekes rest, His heart on them he sets, Seeking true happines, And good in earth alone; Beleeuing not true blisse, To be in things vnknowne. Thus our desires impure, Peruert the blessings kind, Wherewith Heauen seekes t'allure Our heart and thankfull mind, To sorrowes and to grieues, To curses and to snares. But why doe men beleeue This gulfe and Sea of cares, To be a place of blesse? And therein so delight, As if Heauen did possesse Nothing so faire and sweet? If trauelling we spie, Some silly earthen Cell; We argue instantly, That beggers therein dwell. But seeing buildings faire, Some Castle, or rich thing; We streight coniecture there, Remaines some Lord or King. Why doe we not the same, When we poore Earth behold; And Heauens bright Azure frame, With lights so manifold? Doe beggers Cells abound With so great wealth and store? And shall the Kings be found More indigent and poore? No doubt the Heauens containe More worthy things and high, Then doth on earth remaine, Tho hid from mortall eye. Tho by affirmatiues, We can but scarcely show, VVhat we by negatiues, And opposites best know; In nature and in sight Is Earth to Heauen oppos'd: In Earth dwells endlesse Night, And Ignorance enclos'd; Excessiue Heate and cold, Labour and VVearines, And Torments manifold: But Heauen hath none of these. In Earth Strife and debate, Eternall Sorrowes dwell; Fraude, Rapine, Lust and Hate, Diseases, Death and Hell. But Heauen's the place of Ioy, VVhere God himselfe vnuailes; VVhere Sinne, where Sad annoy. VVhere Death no more preuailes, Therefore you holy Soules, Seeke happines aboue: None seeke it here but fooles, VVhose ioyes do sorrowes proue. Chap. XXXVI. [Where blessings infinite] And all this Worlds Torments and Miseries no more but shadowes of those that remaine for the damned Soules in Hell. Where blessings infinite, And mercies cannot moue, There paine, an obiect fit, And torments we doe proue, To rouze the soules closde eies From sad and dismall slumber Of false securities, That most our soules encumber: But as this worldly blesse, And glory to earth giuen, Is but a type, and lesse Of that which is in Heauen. So all the torments dire That Tyrants here deuise, To feede the flaming fire, Of their sad cruelties, No more then shadowes be Of that tormenting paine, That for impietie Th'infernall Lakes containe. Name all th'inuentions old, Deuisde by haples wits; Those torments manifold, Where death and horror sits Enthron'd in burning flames, With Chaines, with Cords and Steele, With bloodie seruile traines, With Gibbets, Racke and Wheele. The cursed scythian hate, That sow'd vp liuing men In Beasts exentorate, And there did nourish them, Till putrifaction might Engender creatures new, And death produce to light, Her selfe deuouring crew, The liuing men to kill, (Tho killing they bestow'd A Tombe on him they kild, More then the Tyrants would.) The fearefull brazen Bulls Of Phalleri expose. The poore vnhappy Sculls, Made Goblets by their foes: Obserue the Pirameds, (Not those by Niles fat side) But piles of slaughtred heads, Fram'd so by Turquish pride. See all the dreadfull things, Brasilia and her feasts. The Bowkani fraught with limbs Of men to feed men beasts. Yet all these torments here, Which tongue cannot reueale, As shadowes doe appeare, To that the damned feele. Below there is a pit, Within the Center closde, VVherein to torments fit, The damned are exposde. VVhere Horror like a Queene, Sits thron'd in burning steele; And Torture with whips keene, Close tending at her heele: Ten thousand vgly Hags, Ten thousand fierie Drakes, Are there with burning Drags; Ten thousand hissing Snakes. Ten thousand Damps and Smells, Eternall darksome Night. Ten thousand thundring Yells Of Furies that doe fight: Ten thousand Blasphemies Gainst Heauen doe there rebound. Ten thousand Curses, Cryes, And Othes make all resound. Ten thousand pale Fires run Through black Cocytus waues: In burning Phlegiton As many Furies raues: Ten thousand greedy VVolues, Ten thousand grisely Beares; Ten thousand gaping Gulphes Breed here ten thousand Feares. Ten thousand Harpies then, And Vultures there doe stay, To tyre on wretched men, That earst on men did pray. Excesse, here leane and poore, Vpon her owne flesh feeds; And VVrath hath wounds great store, Ten thousand thousand bleeds. There Pride is neatly put In new and strange attire, In Red and Crimson cut, Lac't through with gards of fire: But for the greedy Syres, That meanes nor measure hold In their vniust desires, Are cups of moulten Gold. For itching Lust remaines, Not least respect and grace; The Fiends with burning flames Them euery houre embrace. Ambition hath no doubt A fitting plague assign'd; A rack to lengthen out The bodie to the mind. For Enuie is adrest The wreathes of hissing Snakes, From whence into her brest New poysons still she takes. Then in the Soule recides Furie, Despaire, and Rage At God, which them diuides From him, an endlesse age. Thus both aliue and dead, Scorcht both with Frosts and Flames; One while in burning bed, And streight in Icie streames; Stench neuer kills them here, Night neuer shuts their eyes; Noyce neuer deafes their eare, By wants or wounds none dies. The senses all remaine, And euery facultie, To worke their greater paine, Their selfe tormenters be. Therefore feare God, and dread Not men, that can impose Nothing vpon thee dead. Shun Hells eternall woes. Chap. XXXVII. [How much vnlike this great World seemes to be] The comparison of the great and little Worlds. Et creauit Deus hominem, ad imaginem, &amp; similitudinem suam, ad imaginem Dei creauit illum. Genes. 1. How much vnlike this great World seemes to be Vnto this little World in quantitie? And yet in qualitie how neere they come? Within the compasse of comparison. The Heauens and Earth this greater World we name; Of Heauen and Earth's composde, this lesse Worlds frame. The Sunne illuminates the Heauens all, And giues earth life. So in these bodies small, The soule performes as much. The Sunne transmits His influence, his light and benefits, Through the tralucent bodies interposed, And triple Ayre, in Regions three disposed. Euen so the sentient Soule likewise susteines Both moues and gouerns, as with certaine reines, On th'ayrie wings of threefold Spirits sent, Each facultie of this her instrument. And as the Sunne from two halfe Hemispheares, Illumines Earth (which otherwise appeares But a sad mansion:) So the soule affords The like, through her halfe seene, halfe hidden Orbes. The Sunne by rarifaction doth euoke Th'attenuated Waters, vaprous Smoke To th'ayres cold Region, and, condensed there, Melts them, to feede the Earth, and coole the ayre. The like againe doth Natures lesser Sunne; (The Soule I meane) when through concoction, Motion, or other cause the vapours flie Vpwards; if through the head transpired they be, They haue their vses in Dame Natures Hall. But if dissolu'd, like showres in Haruest fall, And many a time the worst disease beget. Thus squares the sentient facultie with it. But the supreame irradiance of the mind, Farre liker to the Worlds high Soule we find, Both incorporeall essences, and high, Vnbounded by Time, Place, or Quantitie. And as the Worlds high Soule, containing all, Is not contained. The like thing doth befall To this of ours. As that hath supreame powre In all: so by Creations right hath ours Ore this her petty Kingdome. And as that Doth this great World two waies illuminate, By corporall and incorporeall meanes: So seemes the soule to powre forth two-fold beames. Beames that doe this dead earth viuificate, Beames that doe this darke sence illuminate, Beames that forth from that light and essence flow, That in it selfe both light and essence holds. And as God is by his infinitie Of essence euery thing: So mens soules be After a sort, by apprehending all Materiall things, and immateriall. And as that hath perfect knowledge and will, So had this, tho now spoild by Satans ill. But much they differ in existencie. God of himselfe subsists. But by him, we, By whom our soules were first of nothing made: The perfect patterns of th'Ideas laid Vp in the secret closets of his mind. Now for the Earth, altho therein we find Betwixt things ouall, and things angular, But little semblance, Yet some things there are, Which (in a measure) paralels may seeme. We haue both frozen Poles, and burning Line. The head and feete, that furthest off remaine The frozen Poles, I may imagine them. The parts precordiall, Line and Center be; Where natiue heate consumes humiditie. Within the earth is many a burning fire; And in our selues Diseases, and Desire No small flames breed When Water, Fire, or Aire, Would from Earthes wombe vnto their homes repaire, But are deteynd, what Feauors they ingender? And in our selues the same effects they render, As diuerse know. An oylie humor feeds Our Natiue heate: Trees haue the like, and Seeds, Our flesh is but a humour, that's concreat, Earths superficies is no more: the sweat And fatnes of the clouds. Nature alone Imparts not fat and marrow to our bone. Earth hath her fat, which sulphure we doe call; Which feeds her Bones, her Mines and Minerall. Nature to vs alone, haire hath not lent. The Woods and Groues are Earths like ornament. Dame Nature not alone our wants supplies With fruitfull Veines, and panting Arteries. The christall streames, and Riuers salt tide washt, In stead of these, are reasonantly plac't. The two great Seas, the Terrene, and the Ocean, That mouing still, this seeming void of motion, Natures Magazines of humiditie, Be as in vs the heart, and Liuer be. How like are these? yet how vnlike againe? All faire, did not mans sinne their beauties staine. XXXVIII. An Elegie vpon the Death of the most Illustrious Prince Henrie. I doe not grieue when some vnwholsome aire Mildewes rich fields, nor when the clusters faire Of Claret, rot through too abundant showers: I grieue not when some gay vnsauory flowers Are nipt and withered by th'vntimely Frost. Onely herein my patience suffers most, When the sweet Haruest and expected gaine Of Vertues Vintage; ere full ripe is slaine. When Time the Wheat with cruell sythe cuts downe, But leaues such vulgar weeds as we vnmowne, Darnell and Vetches: When these mortall lights Extinguisht be, should guide our dimmer sights. Then, then I weepe, and wish the watry clouds Would furnish me with teares, to weepe whole flouds. Then wish I Boreas (whose killing breath is ne'er perfum'd with sweets of Indian Earth) To lend me sighs. I wish the [illeg.] groanes, The Pellicans thrill shrikes to expresse my moanes. I wish my selfe those Dedalean wings, To search the glorious Courts of th'Easterne Kings; And a strong Pattent seal'd from powerfull IOVE, Freely to take all that my thoughts approue. First, would I then in Indian Forrests slit The weeping Plant (with Iuorie Knife) to get Such pretious liquor vncorrupted cleare. As might enbalme heroyck Henrie here. Then would I next to Tauris Gardens pierce For rarest flowers, to strew vpon his Hearse: Th'Indies should yeeld vs Diamonds, China Gold; [illeg.] the Siluer that her lap doth hold; Sylon and Ormus, all their Pearle should send, The Congian Slaues from secret Caues should rend The Chyan Marble, white Cassidonie, Greene Lacedemon, and red Porpherie, The pure white Marble got in Palestine, And rare Numidian spotted Serpentine. Tuskane should yeeld me then some Architect, Whose artfull wit should first these Stones dissect With Sand and toothlesse Saw; and then engraue What stories there you memoriz'd would haue. Which worke let mine imagination frame So large, that the whole Earth might seeme to th'same A fitting Basis, whence a loftie Spire, Through the triple airie Regions, and much higher, Should penetrate: so should the whole Earth be His tombe, and the faire heauens his Canopie. This Piramed, a Pharos, seruing right For to direct the storme tost wandring VVight To safetie: for since Fate dids life designe, A patterne vnto this Cimmerian time To imitate; tho Atropos accurst, His Clew but new begun, in sunder burst; Yet that small piece in tables Smaragdine, I would preserue for light therein to shine From these our Labyrinthian waies vneuen, To guide vs iust that way he went to Heauen. XXXIX. [Mortalls lament; for Nature now and Fate] Mortalls lament; for Nature now and Fate Seeme at great odds, and both with mutuall hate To crosse each other: Else why is it still, If ought be faire, or good by Natures will, Fate cuts it off? Your Peach with much adoe Escapes the Frost; yet liues the bitter Sloe In spite of Winter. Wheate and other Graine, These oft are blasted, Weeds are seldome slaine. A thousand mischiefes and diseases tend The towring Falkon, soone to worke her end; When Puttocks last, and Crowes liue many a yeare. Th'Arabian Courier, prized so high and deare, He's melted in one day, perhaps, and dies; But th'wretched Asse suruiues all miseries, Strokes, endlesse toile and famine. And we soe The like in men: If Nature bounteous be Once in an Age, and striues to make one blest With her rich fauours, him before the rest Fate soonest aimes at. Let me instance take, That Royall hope, whom Nature stroue to make The very modell of Perfection: How soone Fate cut him off? And now is gone (O word scarce to be nam'd with fewer teares) Candishe, the Noble, Vertuous; tho in yeares Younger then Adon, yet like Nestor wise; Though greene in blooming youth, ripe in aduice; Whom Nature as a Cabinet did frame. Therein to stow all things that Mortals name Rich, faire, or good, which Death by Fates decree Hath broken vp, and now quite robd we be Of treasure had enricht this barren time, And reduc't plenty. Fate these workes of thine Are much too deepe, for dim eyes to discerne: For though some ignorant perchance would terme This Ciuill warre; yet farre be such offence From vs, to thinke the diuine prouidence Which leades these second causes, euer may Be selfe diuided. But this right we say, That as these mortall Gods on earth doe vse, All things or rich or faire, themselues to chuse; Thinking th'inferiour sort vnworthy such; So seeme the Heauens herein to doe as much: If Mines of Marle, or Coale, or such like stuffe Be found, the Soueraignes thinke it good enough For the meane people: But if Gold, or Plate, That's for themselues. Wherein they imitate The Heauens; so that indeed there seemes to be In their designes a kind of simpathie: Both choose vnto themselues what good they deeme; Tho men mistaken, oft-times most esteeme That which most harmes them. But the Heauens, which know The natures all of things they frame below With cunning hand, in this faire Garden gather Each beautious flower, leauing the weedes to wither By time, and courses fit for them ordain'd, Since these likewise for hidden ends were fram'd. Iohn Hagthorppe. XL. [You Culuers of the VVood lend me your grones] Teares for Sir Tho. O. You Culuers of the VVood lend me your grones: You Mandrakes shrikes, and mournefull Pellicanes: You mid-night Birds, lend me your dismall tones; And all that wrongfull villanie complaines. Oh lend me, lend me all the dying straines You Snow-white Swans, which on Meander swim, Doe at your deaths in funerall Dirges sing. You Elephants caught in the Peguan Toyle; You Nubian Lions, that the naked Moore, Or wilde Arabian (for your ancient spoile) Compells in vaine his mercie to implore. Thou raging Tygre, and fierce Mantichore, Lend me your powres combind, that I with cries May rend the Marble Mountaines, and the Skies. Lend you me sighes, you Typhons of Tercear; Let teares like Such was that of Cizicum, and that of the Gallerie at Olympia, which from thence had [illeg.] appellation. Heptaphonon. Plin. lib. 36. cap. 15. Atlas frozen Haile distill: Oh lend me words you seuen-fold ecchoes cleare, Your plaints tormented Ghosts in Heclaes Hill; That so my sighs, teares, plaints, may blast and kill All smiling flowres, and trees adorn'd with greene, And (like my selfe) make Earth a mourner seeme. Oh let me, let me sprinkle the free Ayre With these my boundlesse woes! But I am dumbe. Imprison'd soules herein seeme happier; My Reason hath to me deni'd a tongue. For as too vehement obiects ouercome The senses; so the Vnderstanding's lame, To vtter things that doe transcend the same. Hence therefore let me flie with Swallowes wings To Tesset is a little Towne in Africk in the Desart, distant from the neerest habitation three hundred miles. Leo. Tessets barren Desarts, where no Wight, No saluage beast frequents, or creeping things; Or to Condorian Caues, where sixe moneths night May make me hate th'unwelcome entring light, And flie back to my Caue againe, to find A constant darknesse, suting mine owne mind. There will I build mine euerlasting Cell, Obliuion and my selfe will liue together. If in an Age some aske, who there doth dwell? My selfe will through the wall or doore deliuer Some feined Names, and send them thence else-whither, That cruell men which for their dearest friends Thus dig the graues, may not my peace offend. Here Silence and my selfe will hug each other: And if we walke, on soft Mosse will we tread. Here Contemplation shall be my sworne Brother. And Sorrow where we friends this theame will reade; That tho teares doe not profit those are dead; Yet if for true friends, teares be ere well spent, Tis when false friends betray friends innocent. A short elegiack Verse, written vpon the vnfortunate Deaths of the thrice worthie Gentlemen, the Sheffeilds, drownd in Humber. Oh where am I! I thought I earst had died, I was so frozen vp, and stupified With Artick darknesse, and Condorian cold, Which these late moneths, lifes faculties did hold Imprisond, in the center of my heart. Sure slaine I was, I felt so little smart, At the chill newes of Humbers fatall deed, My tongue to moue, mine eyes forgat to bleed. (For water cannot expiate what water did) When Vertues Children lie vnburied; Shall I be then lesse sensible, lesse kind, Then Mecchaes Pilgrims, which themselues doe blind, And rather doe for custome sacrifice At marble shrines, then pious loue, their eies? No, I will weepe, and weepe, and weepe againe, Till in my conduits, humours none remaine, To giue my Fountaines liquid supplement. And when those pipes and hollow caues are spent, Mine Aire in them condenst likewise shall be, And transmigrate to moysture presently, From whence I may deriue a fresh supplie, Euen whilest I liue to weepe, and weeping die For them, whose worthes and fatall chance excell The powre of Time, in both to paralell. A Funerall Canzonet vpon the vntimely death of an Honourable Ladie vnder the name of Stella. Streame teares, and in your waterie language let My passion speake the sorrowes of my mind, Since words want weight, and tongues in vaine are set To vtter woes, that haue not bounds assign'd; Since Stella's dead, so noble, faire and kind, That no tongue truly can her losse expresse, Then mine be mute, speake eyes my heauinesse. But Stella's dead, and I in vaine doe striue To limit water, or confine the aire. My words will perish that I would repriue, And griefe hath dried the springs, whence teares repaire. So hard to forme, I find our passions are, That what my Reason most incites me to, I blindfold seeke, but quite contrary goe. For Winters Frosts, or Summers Heate haue dried My teares, and put this tempest in my tongue, When reason rather of the two had tried, Teares to haue tenderd, then this Dirge to haue sung; For Stella's death, so Noble, Faire and Young, On my soules anuile, such crosse passions breake, That my tongue weepes, whilest these mine eyes should speake. [Time, I euer must complaine] Time, I euer must complaine Of thy craft and cruell cunning, Seeming fixt here to remaine, When thy feete are euer running; And thy plumes Still resumes Courses new, repose most shunning. Like calme winds thou passest by vs; Lin'd with feathers are thy feete: Thy downie wings with silence flie vs, Like the shadowes of the night: Or the streame, That no beame Of sharpest eye discernes to fleet. Therefore Mortalls all deluded By thy graue and wrinckled face, In their iudgements haue concluded, That thy slow and snaile-like pace, Still doth bend To no end, But to an eternall race. Budding Youths vaine blooming wit, Thinks the Spring shall euer last, And the gaudie flowres that sit On Flora's brow, shall neuer taste Winters scorne, Nor forlorne, Bend their heads with chilling blast, Riper age expects to haue Haruests of his proper toyle: Times to giue, and to receiue Seedes and Fruits from fertile soyle: But at length, Doth his strength Youth and Beautie all recoyle. Cold December hope reteines, That the Spring each thing reuiuing, Shall through-out his aged Veynes Powre fresh Youth, past ioyes repriuing: But thy Sithe Ends his strife, And to Lethe sends him driuing. To Earth. Earth, thou art a barren Field Of delight and true contenting: All the pleasures thou do'st yeeld, Giue but cause of sad lamenting: Where Desires Are the fires, Still our soules tormenting. Riches, Honour, Dignitie, Are the high way to misfortune: Greatnesse is a lethargie, That to death can soone transport one. To be faire, Causeth care, Gifts chaste thoughts importune. To be wittie, quick of tongue, Sorrow to themselues returneth. To be Healthfull, Young and Strong, Feeds the flames, where passion burneth: Yet doe Men Couet them, More then what adorneth. To haue Friends, and Louers kind, That vs round enuiron: Wife and Children, tho we find These be robes that best attire one, Yet their losse, Is a crosse, Melting hearts of Iron. To be perfect here, and wise, Is to know our indiscretions; And our goodnes chiefely lies, In obseruing our transgressions: For we dwell, As in Hell, Thrall to bad impressions. Then alas why long we so, With lou'd Sorrow still to languish; Is there ought on earth but woe, Aye renewing cares and anguish; Where new feares, Still appeares, Darts at vs to brandish? To Death. Then Death why shouldst thou dreaded be. And shund, as some great miserie? That cur'st our woes and strife; Onely because we're all resolued, And in darke errours clouds enuolued, Thinke Death the end of life: Which most vntrue, Each place we view, Giues testimonies rise. The Flowres that we behold each yeare, In checquered Meades their heads to reare, New rising from their Tombe. The Eglantines and Honie-Daisies, And all those pritty smiling faces, That still in age grow young: Euen these doe crie, That tho men die, Yet life from death may come. The towring Cedars, tall and strong, On Taurus and mount Libanon, In time they all decay. Yet from their old and wasted rootes, At length againe grow vp young Shootes, That are as fresh and gay. Then why should we Thus feare to die, Whose death brings life for aye? The seed that in the Earth we throw, Doth putrifie before it grow, Corrupting in his Vrne: But at the Spring it flourisheth, Whom PhÅbus [illeg.] cherisheth With life at his returne. Doth Times Sunne this? Then sure it is, Times Lord can more performe. To Time. Stay wrinckled Time, and slack thy winged haste, Which from our Zenith doth so fast decline In Westerne waues, Lethe thy selfe to raste. Stay, and at length regard this plaint of mine: Thy one daies course is many thousand yeares, And I in vaine pursue thee all my time. Whilest thy declining haste more swift appeare, And thine owne weight precipitates thee to; My feeble leggs their burthen hardly beares, Whilest I pursue to catch thy harrie brow: Put thou like froward Age still writhest away, And to my good endeauours wilt not bow. Yet know, I come not now to beg delay For any debt of mine, or borrowed summe; Nor to repriue my life for some short day: Old Time, it is for none of these I come, But euen to vent my griefes, that thou (to me To pinching) art so prodigall to some. The Vsurer a hundred yeares can see, To cram his chests with theft and poore mens spoile. The Baude stored with all sorts of villanie, And sinnes, that Hell and blacknesse selfe would soile; Liues till her bodie be an Hospitall Of strange Diseases, mischiefes perfect foile. The P. and the P. that are most, Fed by the peoples sinnes, and also feede: Those mischiefes whereby many a man is lost, Which be, old Time, thy worst disease indeed. These doe not want; to doe amisse wants none; But Time to him that would doe well's denide. Thou giu'st the greedie Worldling time to runne, In quest of profit, to the frozen Climes; Then to the burning Line, and thirsting Sunne; To Ganges, the Mollucaes, Phillippines: Tho (more then men) he Nature cozen will, That heate and cold for bounds to him assignes. Thou lend'st the Drunkard time his Cups to spill: Th'art to the Sluggard too indulgent kind; Thou giu'st the Murtherer time to kill; The Thiefe and Lustfull man their prey to find: But those that to imploy thee well are bent, Too little, or iust none haue they assign'd. Ten yeares the guiltie Lawes haue from me puld; My Wants and Cares as much; Sicknes the rest; My best houres, but from Wants and Cares are culd. Oh Time! must he haue least that spends thee best? Oh Time! giue me a Time my selfe t'applie To Vertue and to Knowledge, or to die, FINIS.</field>
