      <field name="fulltext">Suspirium Life of my soule, bright Lord of Love, When shall I from my selfe remove To thee, &amp; to thy Things above! This weary world can nothing show To court an Heart, &amp; make it grow In love with any thing below: So speaks a generous Soule. But I Faint as I am, &amp; weak doe lie Striving, alas, to Think, &amp; Crie. I think a thousand thoughts a day, Yet think not one: each doth betray It selfe, &amp; halfe-made flyes away. I think of Heav'n, I think of Hell, Of what both heer &amp; there doth dwell: Yet what I think I cannot tell. Through all ye World my Mind does run, And when her foolish Course is done, She onely is where she begun. Such Hudling and Perplexity In my tumultuous Heart there bee, That seing all, I nothing see. Sometimes my venturous Thoughts aspire Upon the wings of brave Desire, The High Creator to admire. But straight some worldly Dust flyes up, And my too-willing eyes doth stop, Before they reach that Glorious Top. Great Prince of Peace, give Thou some rest To these Commotions of my breast So shall my Thoughts and I be blest. Me thinks I feele my pregnant eyes Oft times with full-tide sorrow rise: But straight ye living fountaine dies. So the vaine miste fills all ye skie W?? hopes of Rain, yet by &amp; by It leaves it far more hot &amp; dry. Had any eyes more cause to weep, Some plea there were for mine to keep Themselves and all their Tears asleep. But if more Mire is lodgd in Mee Then in ye bottom of ye Sea, Why flow not I, as well as Shee? Sometimes I feele ye Storme arise In swelling sighs; yet out it flies, And drives no Clouds into mine eyes. All other Blasts can coole ye skie, With Copious Humidity: Alas, no winds but mine are drie. Marble that cold obdurate stone Abounds with Teares, whilst I have none, Though of ye same Complexion. Clowds, though as light as I, &amp; vaine, When gaping Earth doth crave for raine, Some welcome drops at least doe strain. But only I a parched Land, And thirsty as ye Lybian Sand, Of my owne Springs have no Command. Broach Thou dear Lord my Springs for me, That all their streames may run to Thee, And in thy Bottle treasur'd bee. For Thee I thirst more then for Them, But if Thou steer'st me through this stream To Thee ye easier shall I swimm. Reasonable Melancholy Tell me no more of Sweets &amp; Joyes; Miscall not Things: Nor flatter poor unworthy Toyes As they were Kings. Tis not a pretty Name That can transformè ye frame Of Bitternesse, and cheat a sober Tast: Tis not a smile That can beguile Good eyes, &amp; on false Joyes true colours cast. I saw some jolly Ladds rejoice The Town was theirs; Secure &amp; ringing was their noise, No thought of fears. At first ye Healths went round And then their Braines; till drownd In what they had devour'd, they sunk. Sweet Joy Said I, w?? thus Steales Us from Us, And leaves us nought but Beasts, or worse then they. Others I spyed at an huge Feast: The wholl Creation Was serv'd up ready dished &amp; dress'd And in ye fashion. They fell too: &amp; some eat A fever w?? their Meat; Some great, &amp; some small surfeits. And are those The Sweets, said I, Of Luxurie? Such Dainties might a Jew afford his foes. Clad with ye Night, &amp; black as Shee Th' Adulterer goes, To steale those Joyes, w?? monstrous Hee Doth rather choose, Then all Heav'ns Sweets. But why Fears He ye Mornings ey? Brave Happinesse, at which ye owner is Asham'd, &amp; tries How to disguise It &amp; Himselfe in conscious Covertnes! All grant that Nuptiall pleasures are Both sweet &amp; cleane: But many think ye sauce is far More soure and keen; All kind of cares are sed To grow i th' Nuptiall Bed. Or if it barren prove, that drie Disease Has greater Greife, And lesse Releife Then all ye thorney Breed of fertilenes. Gentiler Spirits in Music place A soveraigne Pleasure; But yet ye Cords are vext to grace The nimble Measure. The sweetest Harmonie With Sharps must temper'd be. Some Tunes are heavnly; but tis when they meet A Sacred Thing Whereon to sing; And then ye Dittie makes ye Musick sweet. The world has store of Things, which Shee Does Pastimes call, Which though they sweet &amp; tempting be Yet have their Gall. Alas, though time be now Grown old, he's not so slow That we should lend him wings: Doe w? we can He makes no stay; Mistaken Play Passeth not Time away but silly Man. When in ye brisk and yeouthfull Spring My curious eye Walked over every flowry Thing Sweets to descrie; A Rose above ye rest Peep'd up &amp; pleas'd me best; W?? when I would have crop't, I felt her pricks. What hopes to meet W?? any Sweet When to a Rose such thorney anger sticks? But on her leaves a Bee there sate, A buisie Bee; Whose business was to find out what I could not see. On her my hand I laid; But gently, as affraid To hurt so sweet a Thing: Yet cholerick Shee Unsheath'd her sting And murmuring In stead of honey, poison left in mee. With that, as wroth as Shee, or more, Unto her Hive I flung, resolv'd of all her store Her to deprive. Sweet was' ye Honey, and At present did command My likeing, but soone made me sick. And who Said I, dares trust Sweets if we must In Honey grant such bitternesse to flow? Defiance, faire impostur'd Names Of beauteous Cheats, Welfavour'd Lies, &amp; handsome frames Of poisn'd Sweets. Your Bait full fine doth show, But ye false Hook below Is bearded with vexation. Who desires Sweetly to be Destroyed, He May burne in your deare Aromatik fires. It must be so. Could rotten Earth Spring with sound Joyes, Faire heav'n &amp; all its Sacred Mirth Would seeme but Toyes. Immortall Pleasures may A soules brave thirst allay, And those alone; those that are kindled by The flaming grace Of Jesu's face, Which gilds the beauteous Sweets, y? smile on high. Come hither Greife, one draught of Thee Will last more sweet Then all false Joyes Hypocrisie Which heer doth greet Deluded Soules: One Tear Flows with more Honey far Then all Hyblean Hives; one pious sigh Breaths sweeter aire Then all y? faire Arabia, &amp; can sooner reach the skie. Death Look not so fierce; thy hands are ty'd, I know, And must be, till my Master lets them goe. Come let us parl a while, &amp; see What makes y? world to fly from Thee. Perhaps ther's some mistake, &amp; They Should rather run to be thy Prey. Frowne not in vaine; I long to feele thy sword; But Thou &amp; I must stay, till Heavn does give y? word. What Furies hand rak'd up y? monstrous Deep Of shame and horrour, thence to fetch an heap Of shapelesse Shapes, which join'd in one, Make up thy Constitution? Was Night thy Mother, or was Hell? Both which in thy black Looks doe dwell. Or sin more horrid then both They? Sure none But such an hideous Shee could beare so foule a Sonne. No sooner borne but strait Thou learnd'st thy Trade, And 'twas Destruction: All y? World was made Thine easy Prize; nor didst Thou spare To take thy gluttonous fill. But where Is all bestow'd? Thy craving Look Keeps sad &amp; thinn, as Famins Book. All flesh becomes thy food, yet naked bee Thine ougly Bones: Ther's nought but hunger grows in Thee. Great was thine Empire, &amp; thy Conquest great: The proudest Kings bow'd at thy prouder feet. With bold Corruption Thou did'st tread On Glories stoutest, fairest Head. Thou bad'st thy shamelesse Wormes goe feed In Princes bosomes, &amp; with speed Gnaw out y? marks of men, that none might know What difference Humane Dust from common Earth could show. Thus did thy domineering Dread surprize The trembling Earth, w?? scarcely could suffice To find Thee roome, wherin to lay The numerous Nations Thou didst slay. This made Thee bold &amp; venturous grow: Doe you not remember how One day you clamberd up a mighty Crosse? Not all y? Graves you cause, can bury y? Dayes losse. Another kind of Adam on that Tree Thou found'st, whom thy black Mother, though She be Stronger then Thou, &amp; subtler too, Durst never hope to overthrow. Did He not foile Thee in y? fight, And of thy sting disarme Thee quite? Indeed Hee seem'd to yeild; but 'twas to lay A three-dayes Ambushment, y? surer Thee to slay. Submitted not his seeming conquer'd hands, And gently wore thy captivating Bands? Into thy Prison went Hee not Whose mighty door w?? Seales was shut? Then deemed'st Thou thy Selfe secure, And of thy hardy Conquest sure: When from his Ambush thy supposed Slave Starts up, &amp; leaves to Thee thine owne more usefull Grave? And now all y? was Death in Thee is Dead; This was thy Sting, &amp; this lies buried In that strong Grave; and there must lie Till all the rest of Thee doth die. Look not so grim &amp; fierce; we know Y' are not our Lord, but Servant now. Or rather y' are our Freind; doe what you can, You must be courteous now, ev'n in destroying man. All you can doe is but to set us free From what is worse then Death, Lifes Miserie. Have not brave Troops of Martyrs dar'd You to y? fight? &amp; when you fear'd They long'd &amp; woo'd, &amp; prayd to bee Sharers in this Captivitie. And if their strange Request were still deny'd In strong desire of one, a thousand Deaths they dy'd. Sweet Death, so let me call Thee now, thy hand Alone can bring our shipwrack'd Soules to land. Thou with this stormy life compar'd More calme, more sweet, more lovely art. The Graves Thou ope'st are but y? Gates Of blest, &amp; everlasting Fates; Through w?? our Dying life doth pass to be Borne in a surer Birth of Immortalitie. Loves Mysterie (For a Base &amp; 2 Trebles.) The bright inamour'd Yeouth above I askd, What kind of thing is Love? I askd y? Saints; They could not tell, Though in their bosomes it doth dwell. I asked y? lower Angels; They Liv'd in its Flames, but could not say. I asked y? Seraphs: These at last confes'd We cannot tell how God should be expres'd. Can you not tell, whose amorous Eyes Flame in Love's Sweetest Ecstacies? Can you not tell whose pure thoughts move On Wings all feathered with Love? Can you not tell who breathe &amp; live No life but what Great Love doth give? Grant Love a God: Sweet Seraphs who should know The nature of this Dietie, but you? And who, bold Mortall, more then Wee Should know, that Love's a Mysterie? Hid under his owne flaming Wing Lies Love a secret open thing. And there lie Wee, all hid in Light, Which gives Us, &amp; denies Us Sight. We see what dazells &amp; inflames our Eyes, And makes them Mighty Love's Burnt-Sacrifice. Civill Warr Untoward passions, peace: I'm wearied quite: I will allow Only my Anger now, To lash herselfe, &amp; you: Rise Anger, rise and arme; 'tis time to fight. Is it not time, now faint ignoble feare By Cowardize Numbers her Victories; And ever as She flyes Leaves conquer'd Mee Captive to helplesse Care? Is it not time, now Love, that Towring Thing, Forgets to fly At Objects brave &amp; high, And heer content to lie In filthy puddles wets his Noble Wing? Is it not time, now fond Greife wasts my Teares (And all in vaine) Not on my soules foule staine, Which both their Springs might draine But on some idle disappointed Cares? Is it not time, when Zeale hath lost its Eyes, Yet runs as fast As when y? Northern Blast Makes its most headlong hast And knows as little to what end it flies? Is it not time, when Thou thy Selfe art spent, But not on Mee Nor on thy Selfe, though wee Are onely fit to bee The marks at which thine Arrows should be bent? 'Tis time to fight. But oh! I am betray'd! These Rebells are Allready got so far Into my Heart, no care Of mine will help: Sweet Jesu lend me aid. Tabula Secunda in Naufragio Poore Heart, what is this poorer world to Thee? Thou hast a God: Thy Selfe Thou hast: Can He &amp; Thou Not make enough To slight bad times w?? cannot last One minute longer then He lets them be. No wheel of Fate but rowles in his Great Hand And from His Touch its motion takes. No Kingdome jars With ruefull wars And into helplesse peeces breakes But when His Justice doth Divide y? Land. If then it Justice &amp; His Justice be, Why doe thy silly feares gainsay? His constant Will Is Holy still, And must be done: what fooles are They Who would not have y? best Necessitie? Fond Passions, peace: O may that Sacred Pleasure Be done, though your Undoing stand Full in its way: A Soule dares say, I am no looser by y? hand; Heavns Will, &amp; not mine owne, is my best Treasure. Heart, keep Thou That, though thine owne Will be lost, Least Thou thy selfe becomest so. Then though Hell rage On poor Earths stage, All things shall at thy pleasure goe. Unlesse Omnipotencie can be crost. Jesus inter Ubera Maria Cantcl. 6. (To a Base and 2 Trebles.) In y? coolnesse of y? day The old Worlds Even, God all undrest went downe Without His Roab, without His Crowne, Into His private garden, there to lay On spicey Bed His Sweeter Head. There He found two Beds of Spice, A double Mount of Lillies, in whose Top Two milkie Fountaines bubled up. He soon resolv'd: &amp; well I like, He cries, My table spread Upon my Bed. Scarcely had He 'gun to feed, When troops of Cherubs hover'd round about; And on their golden Wings they brought All Edens flowers. But We cry'd out; No need Of flowers heere; Sweet Spirits, forbeare. True, He needs no Sweets, say They, But Sweets have need of Him, to keep them so. Now Paradise springs new with you, Old Edens Beautie's all inclin'd this way; And We are come To bring them home. Paradise springs new with you, Where 'twixt those Beds of Lillies you may see Of Life y? Everlasting Tree. Sweet is your reason, then said Wee, come strow Your pious showres Of Easterne Flowres. Chorus Winds awake, &amp; with soft Gale Awake y? Odours of our Garden too; By w?? your selv's perfumed goe Through every Quarter of your World, that All Your sound may heare, And breathe your Aire. Davids Elegie upon Jonathan 2 Sam. i. Chap. 26 x. What Name of Comfort can returne My Heart to mee! Deare Freind in Thee My life is dead, my Joy doth mourne. O Jonathan, my Reverend Mother, (Though fertile Shee,) Ne'r blessed Mee With halfe so sweet &amp; deare a Brother. Delicious, Freind, wert Thou to Mee; Engaddies Bed Did never spread Perfumes so rich &amp; sweet as Thee. Thy love to Mee, my Jonathan, (Heart spare to break Before I speak) Thy love knew no Comparison. Weak Woman's Love, esteem'd w?? thine, Though stout before, Grew faint &amp; poore; Thy Love, as Thou, was Masculine. Cantic. Chap. 2. xx?? 10-11-12-13. Rise up, my Love, my Fairest One Make no delay; Now Winters utmost Blast hath blown Himselfe away. The Clowdy Curtaines drawn aside To free y? light, No drop is left, pure Heav'n to hide From Thy full Sight. The cheerly Earth doth as She may Reflect Heavns Face, With flowry Constellations gay In every place. Our Birds sit tuning their soft throats The Angels Quire To eccho back: The Turtles Notes With them conspire. The teeming Fig-tree's new borne Brood Abroad appeare: Vines &amp; young Grapes breathe out a good And wholsome Aire. All Sweets invite Us to lay downe Our dull delay Rise up, my Love, my Fairest One And come away. Thou shalt call His Name Jesus S. Luc. i. 31. (To a Base and 2 Trebles.) Xs Is it an Incense Cloud y? breaks, Or is it Balme y? Angell speaks? Chorus Ne'r did Arabian Beds inrich y? Skie W?? such rich breath, nor Easterne feild So pure &amp; balmy Odours yeild; Nor Paradise Perfumes ascend so high. Xs From his fair lips does Balsame flow, Or is it Manna that they show? Chorus Such soveraine Balsame n'er drop'd on y? Earth; The kindest Heav'n ne'r showred downe So noble Manna on its owne Deare flock, when Wonders were its usuall Birth. Xs What is it then, oh who can tell? Speak Thou thy selfe, sweet Gabriell. Chorus 'Tis Heav'n I speake, from whence I hither came To show how all its sweets doe lie Couched in one rich Epitomie Of w?? Great Treasure Jesus is y? Name. Love Say what is Love That little Word &amp; mighty Thing; Which blinder poets as they sing, Conspire to prove Blind as ye Night, And yet as bright As is the Mornings Face W?? all her roseall Grace Or Phoebu's eyes When first they rise And powre their flaming gold through all y? skies. They give him Wings, Such as their foolish quills can make, But stain them w?? their inke: They talk Of warlike things, Of shafts &amp; Bow But say not now Their childish Dietie Should use them, or can see To shoot, &amp; yet They fondly set Pure Sprightfull soules his Mark to practise at. His Mark indeed Are onely Soules, &amp; happy they In being so: His weapons may Cause them to bleed; But first his Dart Pierc'd his owne Heart And broach'd his dearest veine To make them wholl againe. His wound is ope All theirs to stop; Nor does He ever meane to close it up. Soules are His Mark, And well He sees to hit them too. Nor is His never-failing Bow Bent in y? Dark. All one bright Eye Is Love, &amp; by The Day y? from it breaks His noble aime He takes. Soft as y? Ray Of this Sweet Day Are all His healing Shafts where e'r they slay. Who calls Fire blind? What slaunder dares accuse y? spark, And blushes not to call it dark? What Eye can find Shades in y? flame? Who prints y? Name Of Night upon y? Beame, W?? from high-Noon doth streame? The Spark, y? Beame, The Fire, y? Flame, Of glorious Love are but a severall Name. And oh how far They faile of what they faine would say! Love is a nobler kind of Ray; No trembling star No labouring Fire W?? doth aspire Into a wavoring Flame; No vaine ambitious Beame Which swells upon The garish Sunne Has light enough to make Love's shade alone. Goe but w?? Mee To yonder Hill, where Valiant Love The utmost of His power did prove; And you shall see His strength, &amp; how He us'd his Bow. Tis worth your sight; Great Kings Have wishd to see those things. And wish they may, But Love will stay His owne time, He's a Greater Prince then they. And yet He came Hither at last. Mark that crosse Tree No other Bow but that brought Hee: And on y? same Stretch'd with full strength Himselfe at length And shot at Death &amp; Hell. But since those Monsters fell, He aims His Darts At none but Hearts He heales by wounds, by killing Life imparts. In His faire Eyes Millions of little Loves doe play, As Atoms in y? highnoone Ray. Who can comprise Those radiant Pleasures And smiling Treasures That all in His Sweet Face Find their delicious place! Which when Heaven spy'd Though vilify'd On Earth, her owne dull Sun She strove to hide. Sweet Warrior, Whose soft Artillery does invite All enemies unto y? fight; Though their cheife feare It be, least they Should win y? Day. What gaines a soule, when Shee Yeilds not to Life, &amp; Thee? When Shee doth choose Herselfe to loose Rather then Thou shouldst win Her from her woes! How dead am I Sweet Master of Heavns Archerie, Because I am not slaine by Thee! Help Mee to die, Lest dangerous Death Suck up my breath Before I live: My Heart Will need a speciall Dart: Yet make no stay, Look but this way, Thy potent Eyes my Soule will quickly slay. Love Exod. 3. Observe that Bush, it was as dry as Thee Or Mee. A Simple Shrub it was, &amp; every Blast That past Made it her sport; No Bird y? flew y? way Would stay Upon so poor a perch; It onely was, Alas, Meet food for flames: And flames made their repast At last Upon its boughs; but yet no flames of prey Were they, No ravenous fire, but innocent &amp; bright As Light, When in a Crrystall Mirrour her Sweet Ray Doth play. Such are y? Flames of Heavnly Love, whose heat Though great, Yet in a Mortall Bosome they can dwell As well As in y? Seraphs Breasts, &amp; harme it not. In that And these poor Shrubs of Ours 'tis but y? same Sweet Flame. Who but y? Great Creatour flamed there? And heere Who burnes but Hee? who but y? God above Is Love? Ad S. Angelum Custodem Who e'r Thou art, oh y? I knew thy Name, My winged Guardian, as Thou knowest mine; Faire in my verses would I write y? same, And what my Name doth want, supply by thine. Who e'r Thou art, for certaine simple I Unworthy am to be thy Ward &amp; Care: Why should Immortall Spirits hither fly And spend their time on Dust &amp; Ashes heer? Is it not faire y? Stars dart Us their Light, To look about Us, &amp; ourselves defend; But higher Flames, &amp; far more rich &amp; bright Leaving their Orbs, Themselves to Us must lend? Does Heavn come downe aforehand to be sure To catch Us up at length, &amp; send us hither Some of its Natives, whose care may inure Us to its fashions e'r We climb up thither? Or come these sweet protectors Us to cover As We doe journey in this dangerous Way; Whose courteous Wings over our Heads doe hover Lest this lifes Tempests blow our Dust away? Sure for these Reasons, &amp; for more then these, Which LOVE well wots of: He y? marks their Eyes, Their Face, their Wings, their yeouthfull vigour; sees That LOVE their Master is, who them imployes. O my Deare Freind, Dearest but Him whose love Befreinded Me with Thee, what shall I say! W?? way so e'r my labouring thoughts doe move, Profound amazement standeth in their way. What shall I say! Hadst Thou no work at home, Where Nothing dwells, but pure as thine owne eyes; That Thou shouldst leave them, &amp; thy Selfe, to come And wait on Me, &amp; my Deformities? Is not all Heavn, &amp; what makes Heavn to be The Name of sweetnesse, is not JESU'S Face More worth y? looking on? Deserves not He The Service, which on me Thou dost displace? Or is y? Quire above so meane a Thing, And Hallelujah grown so dull a Song, That in mine eare Thou choosest now to sing And to my Heart-strings tune thy charming toung? Oh how dost Thou Sweet Spirit, indure in Mee What I doe blush at? And this is, alas, My Selfe, ev'n all my Selfe: nought can I see But one confused &amp; polluted Masse. Canst Thou attend on Him, whose hatefull Will Kicks his and thy Creators Laws? Canst Thou Him with Thy Silver Feathers shelter still Whose Life prefers those in a Bed below? Were it thy charge at Edens Gate to stand, And with a two-edged Flame stop Me from thence; Well would that Sword become thy Heavnly hand; So faire a place deserves thy sweet Defence. But armed w?? stouter Flames of patient Love Thou strivst at that sweet Gate to thrust me in; That I a Bird of Paradise might prove, No more a Swarthy Rav'n, tannd black with sin. Ne'r did ripe Dangers my poore Breath assaile, But Thou wert ready still to play my part: Allways for Me did Thy Sweet Wings prevaile And fannd fresh Comfort on my panting Heart. Thou wouldst not have me snatcht by Sudden Death, But be allow'd full time to mortifie, That I might stop, e'r Shee did mine, Sins Breath, Till I can live Thou wouldst not have Me dye. When I doe sleep, whither by Day or Night (For I'm but halfe-awake when I am up:) And thousand unseen Spirits against Me fight, Thy stout Protection all their force doth stop. Forbeare, saist Thou, foule Cowards, to oppose A little Thing of Dust; or know that I Am set to keep these Mud walls from their foes; Have you forgot y? feild We fought on high? Then breathst Thou vigour through my trembling Breast, And clap'st thy wings upon my fearfull back; That so incourag'd I might doe my best Where nothing, but mine owne Will I can lack. The more y? Shame: How oft have I betrayd My Selfe &amp; Thee! &amp; flung away y? sheild None could have wrested from Mee, till I laid It downe my Selfe, &amp; was content to yeild. Couldst Thou be angry, Surely Thou wouldst be My greatest foe, as being offended most, Excepting Him, who Guards both Thee &amp; Mee, Him onely have my Crimes more fowly crost. For His dear sake be Thou like Him, &amp; spare Those Provocations, w?? I offer Thee: Or draw thy Wrath, &amp; strike a wholsome feare On all these Sins w?? vex both Thee &amp; Mee. So may thy awfull Presence teach my Heart Heer to acquaint w?? thy pure Company; And in our Makers Prayses bear her part, If He so pleases in your Quire on high. So when y? Trump sounds in my hollow Grave, To wake this Dust to an Immortall Day, Thy hands Sweet Help, &amp; conduct may I have To lift me up, &amp; lead me in y? way. The Gnat One Night all tyred w?? y? weary Day, And w?? my tedious selfe, I went to lay My fruitlesse Cares And needlesse feares Asleep. The Curtaines of y? Bed, &amp; of mine Eyes Being drawne, I hop'd no trouble would surprise That Rest w?? now Gan on my Brow To creep. When loe a little flie, lesse then its Name (It was a Gnat) with angry Murmur came. About Shee flew, And lowder grew Whilst I Faine would have scorn'd y? silly Thing, &amp; slept Out all its Noise; I resolute silence kept, And laboured so To overthrow The Flie. But still w?? sharp Alarms vexatious Shee Or challenged, or rather mocked Mee. Angry at last About I cast My Hand. 'Twas well Night would not let me blush, nor see With whom I fought; And yet though feeble Shee Nor Her nor my Owne Wrath could I Command. Away She flies, &amp; Her owne Triumph sings; I being left to fight with idler Things, A feebler pair My Selfe and Aire. How true A worme is Man, whom flies their sport can make! Poor worme; true Rest in no Bed can he take, But one of Earth, Whence He came forth And grew. For there None but his silent Sisters be, Wormes of as true &amp; genuine Earth as He, Which from y? same Corruption came: And there Though on his Eyes they feed, though on his Heart They neither vex nor wake Him; every part Rests in sound sleep, And out doth keep All feare. The Sluggard The World awoke, &amp; op'd his flaming Eye, Which darted through y? skie The broad daylight; And at y? sight The virgin Morne, though Shee Were up &amp; drest before, Yet blushed all o're In Heavnly Modestie, As if s'had slept too long, &amp; were Asham'd y? Sun should look on her Being but newly risen, and arrayd In a gray Mantel like some homely Maid. Yet all this while in spight of this Sweet Light, Mine Eyes huggd Sleep &amp; Night. I snorting lay, As if y? Day Some foure houres off had been: I who had much to doe, Further to goe, And more to loose or winne, Then had y? Morning, yet let Her Be up &amp; gone, e'r I did stirr. Perhaps She blush'd to see how drowsy I Slep'd out all Shame, whilst Shee had flown so high. At length y? Sunne growne high enough to look In at y? window took His view &amp; spy'd Out my Bedside. The Curtaines were of my Lazie Conspiracie. But Carefull He Sent a quick Ray to pry Into y? Tent of Sloth, &amp; mark Why in y? Morne it should be dark. This found me out, &amp; glaring on mine eyes Stood wondring at Me, why I did not rise. The sleepy Mists thus chased from my Brow, I woke, I knew not how: I cannot say Whither like y? Day I blushed in my Rise Or no; though surely I Had more cause why; For as I rubbd mine Eyes A sudden Consort filld mine eare; Plaine were y? Notes, but sweet &amp; clear, The honest Birds up long, long before Mee Were at their Mattens on a Neighbour Tree. And does y? Day rise more for Birds then Mee That they should earlyer bee At work then I, Who have to flie Higher then they, &amp; bring A Morning-Sacrifice Of Greater price Unto my God &amp; King! Up tardy Heart for Shame; but downe Lower againe upon thine owne Imploring Knees; that is y? surest way To Rise indeed, fairer then did this Day. Bedtime And now y? Day w?? in y? Morne was thine, Poor Heart, is gone, &amp; can returne no more: Bury'd in this dark Ev'n it goes before, And tells Me y? y? next Night may be mine. Nay why not this? A surer thing is Death By far then Sleep: That nightly drowsy Mist, Which climbs into thy Braine to give Thee Rest, May by y? way obstruct thy feeble Breath. The Day is gone; &amp; well, if onely gone, Is it not lost? Cast up thy score, &amp; know. Ar't so much neerer Heavn, as Thou art to Thy Death; or did thy Life without Thee run? Alas it ran, &amp; for me would not stay, Who waited on my fruitlesse Vanities. I might have travl'd far since I did rise, In praying &amp; in studying hard to-day. Great Lord of Life &amp; Time, reprieve Me still, Whom My owne Sentence hath condemn'd; That I May learne to live my Life before I die, And teach my owne, to follow Thy Sweet Will. Dull Devotion Me thought Heavn calld Me, when I heard y? Bell; And I was ready to obey: The plain and surest path I knew full well, It was our Common Chappell way. God has his probatorie Heavn below, An easy &amp; familiar Sphear: An Heavn, whose Gate is broad, y? All might flow In, &amp; for that above prepare. Arrived there, although y? outward face Of what appear'd was plain &amp; milde, Dreadfull I found y? Mildenesse of y? place Being w?? God &amp; Angels filld. Falln on my knees, I had no lesse then leave To supplicate My God &amp; King. Alas, a thousand wants my Soule did greive, I had to ask Him many a Thing. Up went my hands &amp; Eyes: so should my Heart, And so a little while it did: But as my craving Tongue performed her part, I knew not how, my Mind was fled. I was Departed, &amp; interred lay W?? in my selfe as in a Grave: This rotten heap of my owne Dust &amp; Clay To Me a Tomb, &amp; Carkase gave. Or like at least some Image of y? Dead Set there to make his Memorie live. Starke-cold was My Devotion, &amp; tis said A Church this onely Life can give. And is not this a strange Idolatry To worship God w?? Images, And Puppit-Service; as if Mighty Hee Were some such heedlesse Thing as These? Shall Men mock God, &amp; think to move his Love, And not his furie, when we pray? What hopes those Words should e'r be heard above, Which our selves hear not as we say? When unto Man I with requests doe goe, My mind doth w?? my Tongue beare part. I serve him onely w?? lip-homage, who Created both my Tongue &amp; Heart. Forgive Me, Lord; my Prayers w?? are not mine, That Froth w?? on my lips doth bubble; That Aire w?? I misuse, that Name of Thine, W?? I so oft in vain redouble. Faine would I pray my Prayers, &amp; not be Abroad, when heer I Thee intreat. Tame my wild Soule, &amp; tie it close to Thee In whom my Hope &amp; Trust is set. So shall this place be like its Name to Me, And as an Angels Voice, y? Bell. Heer shall I practise My Felicitie, And so in Heavn aforehand dwell. The Waters of H. Baptisme The Worlds Great Lord as once He stood Upon y? brim of Jordans flood Observ'd a greater stream of Men Come flowing in. Their businesse was, Baptiz'd to be, And purify'd: But then said Hee, It much concernes you to be sure Jordan be pure. With that Himselfe step'd in like One, Who seemed but to trye alone, Whither y? Streames they sought so to Were clean, or no. No sooner did old Jordan kisse Those sweet &amp; beauteous feet of His, But smiling Circles on his face Took up their place. And this he thought sufficient Pay For all His Paines, when He made way, And, whilst y? Ark took up his road, Travelld abroad. The Waves came crowding downe apace, Each one ambitious for y? grace To touch that skin, a Purer Thing Then their owne Spring. Thus were They washed, (&amp; not He Who came as clean as Puritie) And washt in these be every Stream Of kin to them. Their pure &amp; most delicious shore, Where Doves of our poor Clime before Their pleasure took, could now invite Heavn to delight. The everlasting Turtle, though Pure intellectuall Streames doe flow Upon y? Firmaments vast Plain, Could not abstain, But downe He came, &amp; by y? side Of this sweet Current He espyde A worthy Perch, as faire a Thing As His white Wing. Heer He his first acquaintance took; Then flew to ever Spring &amp; Brook, Fixing on all Baptismall Streames His best esteem. Thus by this Spirits Company These Streames are taught to purifie Spirituall Things, &amp; cleanse a Soule Though ne'r so foule. Nor new Stains, nor y? ancient spot Which all y? World of Men doth blot Doe stick so deep &amp; close, but they Wash them away. And wash out also that great Score The Deluge ought y? World before Those Waters drown'd all Sinfull Men, These onely Sin. Virginitie Jewell of Jewells, richer far Then all those pretious Beauties are, Which to our West Stream from y? East: The Way Of Day, The Morne though deck'd w?? Heavnly Modestie Blusheth not halfe so gracefully as Shee. For She it was who did let in A Brighter, &amp; a Nobler Sun, Then e'r did rise To Mortall eyes: A Sun Whom none Of all y? Heavns could hold; Gods Son was Hee And thine, Immaculate Virginitie. Would any curious Critick know A thing more white, &amp; chast then snow? First wash his Eye, Then let Him prie, For Shee Will be Clowded w?? in her veile: Though much more bright Then Day, She meekly shrowds her selfe in Night. Lillies are cleanly, white &amp; sweet, And yet they have but dirty feet; Their Roots from Earth Never look forth, But grow Below. Onely this spotlesse Flowre, w?? plants her Root Deep in y? Heavns, did never fowle her foot. For there She grew &amp; flourished Before old Time began to bud: Yea &amp; brought forth A Stem more worth Then all The Ball Of Heavn &amp; Earth: The VIRGIN SIRE alone Eternally begat his VIRGIN SONNE. The yeouthfull beauteous Spirits above With this fair Flowre fell All in love. No marrying there As Wee have here; But They All say, Let dirty wormes below goe wed; whilst Wee Copie our VIRGIN MASTERS Puritie. Yet by your leave Sweet Spirits, now These wormes have crept far after You. Great Gabriell Remembers well What He Did see At Nazareth, a Virgin Spotlesse Thing, Purer then was His Archangelick Wing. Wherfore when He had thither flew Behind his back his Wings he drew, And straitway all His Plumes let fall; He spyde The Bride Of Heavns Great Dove: (How pure &amp; chast was Shee, Which was the Virgin Spouse of Chastitie?) With Reverend Voice &amp; bended knee Haile, full of Grace, to Her said Hee, This complement From Heavn was sent: No Name Became This Soule but That; whose awfull Presence made Gabriel of Her, as She of Him afraid. Hee never saw his Brethrns face Blush w?? a more celestiall grace: And had He spyde About Her side Such Things As Wings, He would have been familiar, &amp; have said Good morrow Brother, to this Sacred Maid. All hail Great Queen of Chastity That Name is due from Us to Thee, Whose Pattern all Our World doth call To come; And some Faire Voluntiers have ventur'd on to fight Under Thy Colours, which are Lilly-white. They have resolv'd to fight w?? Thee The Battells of VIRGINITIE; And to resigne Their Corps like Thine Sinceer And clear Unto their Maker, from whose Hand We see All Creatures come in VIRGIN PURITIE. Affliction Would you make your Sweets more Sweet? Then you must both presse &amp; beat, Till that distresse Make them confesse Their uttmost Secrets in a deep-drawne breath; Which drives a Clowd of Odours from beneath. Would you make your idle Vine Buisie grow, &amp; big with Wine? Kind Crueltie The Salve must be. Call for your hook, &amp; lop y? wanton boughs By which Shee grows indeed, but fruitlesse grows. Has y? long neglected Dust Sheath'd thy glittering Sword in Rust? You must not spare Your sharpest care: Rubbing, &amp; scouring, &amp; such churlish wayes Must faded Metalls to their splendor raise. Yf you say, Whats that to Mee? I'm no Odours, Sword, nor Tree: Then tell me plain, Do'st appertain To Thee to be in thy Great Masters sight (Though on those harsh termes) Fertile, Sweet, &amp; Bright? If so, in these Copies read What salve best will suit thy need. What e'r it be Heer's none we see But hard &amp; sharp. Wholsome Affliction Heavn does prescribe for Us, &amp; that alone. The True Love-Knott I am my Beloveds, &amp; my Beloved is mine. Cant. 6, 3. Turne away thine eyes, etc., v. 5. But why On thy Beloved feeds thine Eye? Can it not feed on Sweets at home, But must to Her for dainties come? Mine Eye Carry'd in Sweet Captivitie Is not mine owne: Her conquering Face Seiz'd on it as She by did passe. Yet Shee Complaines as much of Love &amp; Thee, And sayes She finds Her captiv'd Eyes Made thy perpetuall Sacrifice: O LOVE Mysterious Champion, w?? will prove Victor on both y? sides, &amp; knows How to reap Palmes from Overthrows! These two, Which in an endlesse Combate throw Their fiery Darts from eithers Eyes, At once both win &amp; loose y? prize. Both yeild, And boast that they have lost y? feild; For by that losse they doe obteine Themselves, &amp; that double againe. Thus Shee Layes lawfull claime to Him, &amp; Hee To Her; thus neither is their owne, And yet each others Master growne. Thus Hee And Shee are clearly lost, to bee Found in each other where they meet Themselves, &amp; what they count more sweet. And thus Two Rayes of Light all-beauteous When e'r they meet &amp; court, doe run Into one Sweet Confusion. No right Has this or that into the light It brought, but each has title to All that his Brother Ray can show. Then this The Spouses Song &amp; Triumph is: Not Thou, but I and Thou, are Thine, Not I, but Thou and I are Mine. Fasting What though Her face be pale? This onely showes How She's of kin to Lilie-Chastitie: And still that venerable palenesse flows With Sprightfull vigor from her sober Eye. She cares for no more Blood then will suffice To clothe her Modestie in blushing guise. What though Her looks leannesse &amp; faintnesse speak? Tis policy to keep Her strength within. Let y? plump Gallants mighty Outworks make, And fortifie their double lined Skin. She better bears y? Seige, what ever foes Whither from Earth or Hell themselves oppose. Lesse are Her Walls, &amp; therfore lesser need Of Amunition to maintaine y? fight: But greater far, and subtler is Her heed, Who stands upon Her Watch both day &amp; night Whilst those fat Bulwarks first exposed lye To ease &amp; sleep, then to their Enemy. Shee is no bigger then Her Selfe; She knows What ballast fits Her, &amp; layes in no more Then keeps Her sure &amp; steady as Shee Goes: Her other Stowage Shee reserves for store Of Virtues fraught, w?? though y? glorious East It selfe were hither ship'd, would prove y? best. I'm not at leisure yet, bold Belly, stay Sayes She, I must goe feed my hungry Heart: This most needs meat, for this, if well fed, may For ever live, whilst Thou but Mortall art. Yet when y? Sunne is set, &amp; I can see My Heavn no more, Ile take some care of Thee. Thus Shee Her dangerous Body doth secure, Keeping it tame &amp; humble; thus Her mind Like to its native Heavn, is allway pure From Clowds &amp; Tempests, w?? y? boistrous Wind Of puft up Flesh doth raise: No rampant passion Ruffles Her thoughts, &amp; puts them out of fashion. Shee allwayes is Her Selfe, active &amp; free, Absolute Mistress of Her owne calme Breast: Whilst every part, &amp; every facultie Knows its owne Dutie, &amp; does like it best, No sparkle of Rebellion can peep Where all their proper Orbs &amp; Stations keep. Then blame Her not, if freely Shee refuse What learned Luxurie has studied out; And scorne y? fulnesse Shee might justly use, Those Dainties ever dear, &amp; double bought; For though unto y? Purse they costly are Alas, they spend y? Heart much more by far. Shee knows a Garden where true Dainties grow, Sweets ever Sweet, ev'n after they are downe: There would Shee feast, but 'tis not here below In our dull World that those Delights are sowne. Blame not Her Abstinence, She is most wise Keeps Her Stomach fresh for Paradise. The Little Ones Greatnes Suffer little Children to come unto Mee, &amp; forbid them not, for of such is y? Kingdome of God. Let y? Brave Proud, &amp; Mighty Men Passe on in state Unto some Gate Ample enough to let them in. My palace door was ever narrow: No Mountains may Crowd in that way, Nor at a Needles Eye get thorow. Heavn needeth no such helps as They: My Royall Seat Is high &amp; great Enough w??out poore heaps of Clay. Without Hydropick Names of Pride, Without y? gay Deceits y? play About fond Kings on every side. Let all y? bunched Camells goe With this rich load To y? Broad Road. Heavn needs no Treasure from below: But rather little tender things, On whom to poure Its own vast store, And make of Wormes, celestiall Kings. Heavns little Gate is onely fit Deare Babes, for you, And I, you know, Am but a Lamb, though King of it. Come then, meek Brethren, hither come These armes you see At present, bee The Gate by which you must goe home. There will I meet with you againe, And mounted on My gentle Throne Soft King of Lambs for ever reigne. The Voyage Could I but be Perpetuallie The man I was y? other Day: No Name of fear How fierce so e'r Mee from my Selfe could fright away. No haven, say I, To Privacy: When once my labouring Heart gat thither, My calmed Breast Floated in Rest, And feard no furie of fowle weather: There did I see All things agree In y? Sweet Centre of Gods Will; Where had I cast My Anchor, fast And sure had been my Vessell still. But foolish I Went by &amp; by To hoise my tattered Saile againe, Unrigg'd, unman'd, I put from land Into y? Worlds tempestuous Maine. The flattering Sea Kept truce w?? Mee A while, &amp; least my Spirits should faile, Gently behind Came every Wind And puff'd me up more then my Saile. Smoothe was my way, And I most gay Went on, top and top-gallant fine: I swum in pleasure At ease and leisure, And never thought the Sea was brine. Thus did I ride O'r Time &amp; Tide Till far ingaged in the Maine, That libertie Inclosed Mee Fast Pris'ner in y? boundlesse Plaine. When loe a Clowd Began to crowd Day out of Heavn, &amp; my poor sight: I look'd, but I Could not descry Ought, but a strange Meridian Night. Before I would not, And now I could not Behold that Heavn, which hid its face From Me, as I Before did my From it, &amp; its all-sweetning grace. The treacherous Wind Was soon combind With y? false waves to mock poor Me, Tossing Me high, Ev'n to y? skie, Which well it knew I could not see. Then down I fell As low as Hell; Alas both bottom lesse were found, The Sea &amp; my Vast Miserie, Where I a thousand times was drown'd. Still mutinous Passions In sundry fashions Toss'd me about from Wave to Wave; Still anxious Cares And helpless feares Perplex'd Alarms &amp; Onsets gave. Till at y? last Their furie cast Me on a Rock &amp; split me quite: A thousand Men And yet not one Was I, a most distracted Wight. No help alas For me there was From those vexatious Vanities Which fild y? World; They onely hurl'd Vain froath &amp; foam into mine eyes. Trust me no more For I am poore Cry'd heavy Gold; Much lower I Shall make you sink; You must not think That money true Content will buy. Then Pleasure cries Turne back thine eyes, Thy hankering eyes; No help dwells heer: Although my skin Be fair, within Live Anguish, Rottennesse, &amp; fear. Nay all this All, Which We miscall, Shrunk to its Nothing, &amp; spake true, In Mee you must Not look to trust, Who am as poor &amp; weak as you. And must I die False Freinds, said I Whilst You look on? This Vessell Heer Grieves me not much But oh I grutch To loose y? Jewell it doth beare: A richer one Then ever shone In Princes Crowne: Far more it cost Then You, all You Are worth; &amp; know It is a Soule: Must That be lost? Heer did I faint But my Complaint Mov'd a good Friend, whose Love did buy That Gemm for Mee: Propitious Hee Pitty'd my helplesse Miserie, I had done thinking, And now was sinking, When loe He brings a peece of Wood: Hold fast on this, Said He, it is Thine Ark against y? worlds vast Flood. This was y? Tree Of Life to Mee: Much like an Anchor was its frame; A Tree of Rest All sweet, all blest A Crosse in Nothing but its Name. I held it fast And easily past The tamed Waves: The boistrous Winde Now blew away It selfe, &amp; Day Ypon y? Smoothed Ocean shinde. An Heavnly Blast Made gracious hast, And filld my Weather-beaten Sail; The Spirit of Love Me gently drove Gainst whom no Ocean may prevaile. And as y? Land Grew neer at hand, Behold, said Hee, y? trustie Shore. Wouldst Thou be sure To rest secure? Venture into y? Main no more: Or sail w?? Mee In y? Sweet Sea, Whose everlasting streams doe flow Above y? Sphears, Where never fears Did rise, nor treacherous Tempests blow. Thus did I come All shipwrack'd home Unto my Selfe: &amp; there must dwell Private and still, Unlesse I will Another Voyage make to Hell. Unreasonable Reason All Christian Soules beware; Hell never went More politickly clad, Nor wiselyer bent Her dangerous powers: Active &amp; quick as Thought Her fair well-spoken Serpents glide about, And by y? fatall Unsuspected Tree Of Knowledge still contrive our Miserie; That Wee more wisely might be fooles, &amp; gain By Profound Art, a far Profounder Pain Reason they breath: Such reason as at first Their Father spake in Paradise; Accurst And stupid Reason, w?? presumes to trie Her wretched Strength against y? Majestie Of Gods eternall Wisdome, God y? Son Must not exceed Her Comprehension. Thus is a Syllogisme Her God, &amp; Three Spruce Propositions, Her great TRINITIE. Alas y? Silly World deluded quite By grosse illiterate Faith, had lost its sight, And in y? Midst of Blind Devotion Had hudled up its Christ &amp; God in one. Yea Christ forgot his word, as loth to keep From this so gainfull Errour Us his Sheep: Till Sacred Arius fir'd w?? zealous love Did vindicate y? Godhead, &amp; remove Intruded Christ. This this was heavnly He Whose Wisdome could Reforme y? Dietie. But stay &amp; view him well: what ailes y? Saint? Is it y? Aire of Nice y? makes Him faint? Suspects He y? his God cannot requite His courtesie, &amp; with his Thunder fright That of y? Councills? Hath his zeale forgot It selfe? All Hell ev'n now was not so hot As Hee: What qualm is this, whose power can make The Mighty Champion of y? Godhead shake? Alas see how y? helplesse Serpent winds To scape y? Blow: &amp; yet no shift he finds, But to disgorge his poyson, &amp; confesse His feigned zeale was Reall Wickednesse. Fond Hypocrite! &amp; didst 'Thou think to play With dreadfull Jesus? Was't enough to say Hee's y? True God, whilst thy proud heart defies Thy Tongues Repentance, &amp; as stoutly cries Against that Godhead? No: Hee'l teach thee hence To know &amp; feel his true Omnipotence. Goe then y? Worlds foule Excrement; thy home Is in y? Common Draught: there thy just doom Will find Thee out. The Churches bowels Thou With Viperous Teeth hast boldly torne, &amp; now Thine owne must answer them. Just Vengeance! Thus Damn'd Judas dy'd, and thus dyes Arius. Come now, who will be next, &amp; bravely trie To teare down Christ from his Eternitie? Who strives to follow these great steps, &amp; prove How far his Noble Logik is above His Saviours Godhead? Lo, I see y? Sage, A reverend Mitre crownes his awfull age: Forth at his Eyes looks Wisdome, zeale doth flame In his Designes, Photinus is his Name. And well He quit him too; far ventur'd He Against y? face of pure Divinity; And doubtlesse much he might have done, but that A thunder-clap from Sardis spoiled his plot. Whence overborne by y? Strong Curse, He fell, Unhappy Wight aforetime sent to Hell. Then look we lower; as they older grow The times may wiser prove, &amp; better know How to assert poor Truth, that y? big Name Of Church &amp; Councills may no longer shame Sinceer Religion, nor bear up so high Th' Usurping Crest of Catholik Tyrannie. Our, our sure is y? Age from whose blest Wombe Both naked Truth, &amp; Her Protector come. And oh who is it? Who but valiant Hee Reasons new Master, Wits Epitomie, The Prince of Syllogismes, y? worthy Heire Of learned Arius, fit to repaire His failing Brood, Hee, whose more reverend Fame Can change y? simple Antiochian Name, And by Arts vast Profoundnes make a Man Of foolish Christian, wise Socinian? Peace then, once more vain Church, peace idle Creed, Peace doting Fathers, &amp; with reverend heed Hear what Resolves y? Holy Oracle makes: Peace all y? World, 'tis great Socinas speaks: And now h'as spoke, what is y? Thing h'as said? Has but blaspheemd more deeply, &amp; betrayd His timorous Predecessor: Tender He Durst never belch forth such broad Impietie. O how Socina's thrift improves y? Stock That Arius left! Tis now a Mighty flock, And by his prudent Husbandry alone Is made ten thousand Heresies of one. Look how y? Traytour steales y? Spirits Sword And with y? word of God wounds God y? WORD. Thus Belzebub of old did with Him fight Masking with Scripture his Infernall Spight. And what does all that Scripture make for Thee Which thou propoundst but in a fallacie? Thy Major &amp; thy Minor cannot prove Any such Termes to dwell in God above. How many Texts proclaime thy trayterous Tongue All black with Blasphemies, exactly wrung Out of y? Dregs of Darknes! O how plain Speak those Great Words, &amp; antidate thy vain Sophistik Answers, so y? Thou thenceforth Wert many ages damn'd before thy Birth. Scorne simple Faith; We like it ne'r y? lesse: Turks may believe as much as you professe. Behind Him wretched Viper: Never trie To tempt y? Lord thy God with Sophistrie. Reason it selfe laughs at thee, &amp; defies Thy Spurious Art, with Sounder Subtlities. The Syllogismes a Catholike Hand doth frame Put all thy juggling Tricks to putid Shame. The utmost strength of thy profoundest sence And disingenuous shifts and Impudence; Whose vain but peevish furie doth confesse, How strong is Faith, &amp; how weak wickednesse. May now y? Curses of all Christian Tongues Fall sure upon thine Head. May what belongs To thy first Father Satan &amp; his Hell, In thy black Memorie for ever dwell; May all thy damned Brood where'r it creep Feel their own Vipers stings, which now they keep Close in their studies. May Confusions Blast Dared so long, come thundring downe at last. May their fowle Names prevent y? Destinie Of their vile Corps, &amp; rot before they die. Be hate their Portion: May to Them our Spight Be like our love to Christ, both infinite, Unlesse they'l not be too wise to imbrace For horrid Monsters, Truths all-beauteous face. Be toads more fair; be Adders hisses sweet; Be Dragons comely; May these rather meet In my poor Bosome, then my Heart should drink But y? least Drop of y? Socinian sink. All hail fair Truth, whose Senioritie Stops y? vain Claime of upstart Heresie. Hail Noble Faith, may thy Triumphant Throne Stand sure upon th' Eternall Corner-stone. Hail Holy Church, thy reverend Wisdome knows The countlesse Greatnesse of thy Sacred Spouse. How dear to Thee is His Divinitie! That Thou holdst sure, That sure upholdeth Thee. Thou hast y? Keys, lock fast in their dark Cell Socinas, &amp; all other Gates of Hell. Crush those fell Powers, which war w?? God &amp; Thee, And in thy Militant State Triumphant bee. Thou hast y? Keys, Dear Mother open wide The golden Gates of Heavn, &amp; safely guide Thy humble Sons, whose HOPE, &amp; wholl DESIRE Is in thy Blessed Bosome to expire. House &amp; Home What is House, &amp; what is Home, Where with Freedome Thou hast roome, And Mayst to all Tyrants say, This you cannot take away? Tis No Thing with Doors &amp; Walls, Which at every earthquake falls: No fair Towers, whose Princely fashion Is but Plunders invitation: No stout Marble Structure, where Walls Eternitie doe dare: No Brasse Gates, no Bars of Steel, Though Times Teeth they scorne to feel: Brasse is not so bold as Pride If on Powers Wings it ride; Marbles not so hard as Spight Armd with lawlesse Strength to fight. Right, &amp; just Possession, be Potent Names, when Laws stand free: But if once that Rampart fall, Stoutest Theeves inherit all: To be rich &amp; weak's a Sure And sufficient forfeiture. Seek no more abroad say I House &amp; Home, but turne thine eye Inward, &amp; observe thy Breast; There alone dwells solid Rest. Thats a close immured Tower Which can mock all hostile Power. To thy selfe a Tenant be, And inhabit safe &amp; free. Say not that this House is small, Girt up in a narrow wall; In a cleanly sober Mind Heavn it selfe full Room doth find. The Infinite Creator can Dwell in it, &amp; may not Man? Contented heer make thy abode With thy selfe, &amp; with thy God Heer, in this sweet Privacie Maist Thou with thy selfe agree, And keep House in Peace, though all The Universes Fabrick fall. No disaster can distresse Thee: Nor no furie dispossesse Thee: Let all war &amp; plunder come, Still mayst Thou dwell safe at home. Home is every where to Thee Who canst thine owne dwelling be. Yea though ruthlesse Death assaile Thee, Still thy Lodging will not faile Thee: Still thy Soule's thine owne, &amp; Shee To an House remov'd shall be, An eternall House above Wall'd, &amp; Roof'd &amp; Pav'd w?? Love. There shall these Mudwalls of thine Gallantly repair'd outshine Mortall Starrs: No starrs shall be In that Heavn, but such as Thee. The Candle The Life and Death I once did mark Of a wax Candle in y? Dark: And by its light Me thought I read Poor Mans short story, His slender glory Soon lighted, soon extinguished. In this blind World, all black as Night, Is Kindled each Mans native Light; And Kindled at a Senior Flame Which if you shall A Candle call, You but describe a Parents Name. When first this infant Light is borne, How tender is its twinckling Morne! When every petty, paltrie Wind Which walks y? way Makes it his play To puffe it out, &amp; leave it blind. As it does stronger grow, it finds More boistrous stormes, &amp; greater Winds, And yet y? worst and foulest fear Doth from within Its mischeif gin, When a slie Theefe appeareth there. But yet of all y? rest, y? cheife And most pernicious fatall Theefe Is blazing, droyling Luxurie: Never was Light So rich &amp; bright But this could wast it suddenlie. But still y? Snuffer may, (&amp; this Nothing but sharp Affliction is) The wastfull Theefe expell &amp; set The trimmed Light In thriving plight, Right safe and quiet, clean &amp; neat. If downward then it does propend, It turnes its owne Theefe, &amp; does spend It selfe in vaine: Steadfast &amp; even The Light must be, Perpetually Upright &amp; burning towards Heaven. If it be hurried heer and there, The troubled Flame cannot forbear To wast its Stock: that Life is best, For Man, which may It selfe injoy Immured safe in private Rest. Yet in that Rest y? Candle lives By preying on it Selfe, &amp; thrives To its owne ruine: Tis y? same False Fire from whom Its Life doth come, W?? proves at length its Funerall Flame. And then, how fine so e'r before, In Faithfull tale It must restore Its Principles; &amp; so discover What was before; Nothing alas, but poor And sallow Ashes furbish'd over. Thus All must dye. But yet We see That In their Deaths they disagree. Some leave a stink, which breatheth in Their Memorie; And these are they Whose grosse Composure smelt of sin. Yet Purer Candles leave behind A pleasing smell, sweet as y? Wind Which at y? Phenix's Funerall Flame Perfum'd his Breath, And blew her Death Through all y? fairest Mouths of Fame. But those clear Tapors, w?? we find Of Virgin wax, leave Them behind And by Unstained Puritie Far, far excell All parallell; These sweetlyest live, and sweetlyest die. But These &amp; They die not to be Bury'd in that blind Destinie. Heavn for y? Dying Spark prepares A better Spheer Above, &amp; there Converts y? Candles into Starrs. The Losse Owho has found! For I have lost A thing y? cost Far more then India's worth, a Thing Which if sinceer &amp; sound, Might be a present for a Mighty King. It was, (had I An Heart to break, This Thought would make The rupture strait; but I have none:) It was, oh heare my Crie Deare Freinds, it was my Heart, my Heart is gone. A Month agoe, Or therabout It slipped out Whilst I went carelesse on my way. But where it dropt, or how, Alas regardlesse wretch, I cannot say. Sometimes mine Eare, Sometimes mine Eye Lets her passe by. Sometimes a Crowd of idle words Drove without wit or feare Safe Convoy to a wandring Heart affords. Sometime my Watch But loosely set Doth easily let Her steale away: whilst idle I Melt in soft ease, &amp; catch At gewgaw Nothings as they flutter by. A thousand wayes Alas I see Where nimble Shee Might make escape: each sin I doe An open passage layes, And by that Mouth invites y? soule to goe. O who has found! The Thing, alas, Unworthy was The taking up: Sweet pleasures say, When you did Mee surround, Bore your soft Streame my weaker Heart away? Say needlesse Cares Did your wild Number My Heart incumber, And made her carelesse of Her selfe, Whilst vain unmanly feares Threw her away upon Lifes sordid Pelfe? How shall I find My Heart againe, Who, though most faine Yet have no Heart to seek that Prize! Thus one already blind Desires to seek his Sight, but wants his Eyes. On Thee alone Who art all Eye My hopes rely. If Thou wilt find this Heart for Mee, Ile give it unto none Henceforth (&amp; tis a bargaine) but to Thee. The Houreglasse Once as I in my Study sate &amp; saw The faithfull Houreglasse w?? what speed it ran, (Much faster then my dull Invention) Me thought I might from thence some Emblem draw. I and y? Sand neer kindred had, my Dust Will proove it so: &amp; for y? tender glasse My brittle Constitution may passe. Time measureth my life, &amp; run it must, But heer's y? difference: That its houre will run, Whilst my poor Life hath not one minute sure. The Glasse, if us'd with care, may long indure: My most uncertaine Life may break alone. When that is out strait turned up againe Its Life renewed is, &amp; runs afresh: But when my Dust is out, this helplesse Flesh Must in its ruine to Times end remaine. Yet then at length my Fate shall happier be: My Dust once turned up from my long Grave, Runs not by sleight vain houres, but stout &amp; brave Triumphs o'r Time by sure Eternitie. Melancholie Out hideous Monster; in thy Name Blacknesse &amp; furie dwell: Home to thy Native Hell, Whose foule Complexion is y? same, The same with thine: both Hell &amp; Thee Proud furious DISCONTENT At once begat, &amp; sent DARKNESSE your Monstrous Nurse to bee. She taught you both to feed &amp; feast Upon your Selves. Feed on, And let poor Man alone; The worst of food becomes you best. Your Parallel will truly hold; Or if some Qualitie In you doe disagree, Be that y? hot Hell, Thou y? cold. Goe then &amp; temper Her; goe dwell Secure from feare of Joy: No Sweets will e'r annoy Or interrupt y? Pangs of Hell. Goe: that foule Monstrous leaden load Which round about Thee twines, With our Desires combines And tuggs Thee downe to that steep Road. No; I must not beleeve Thee: Goe; That palenesse of thy Look Indeed I once mistook For Pieties face, &amp; lov'd it so. Thy sober garb demure &amp; chast Seem'd a fair Preparation For Heavnly Contemplation, Which all this World away doth cast. Needs wouldst Thou, grown severe, despise The Worlds fantastik Joyes, And let no fading Toyes Or charme thine Eares, or win thine Eyes. Alas, poore Feind it will not doe: I know Thee now to bee But y? more Devill: Hee When worst, does in his best Clothes goe; And those are thy white Looks: begone And take along w?? Thee Thy wretched Daughters Three, Doubt, Fear, &amp; Desperation. An active cheerly Heart's for Mee; An Heart of lively Fire, Flaming with brave Desire Able to melt thy Lead &amp; Thee. An Heart of Comfort allways full, Yet taught to beare her part In sturdyest Greife; an Heart, Which can be sober, yet not dull. Tobacco Incroaching Weed; had not thine India room Ample enough for thy bold leaves, but they Over y? Widest Seas must reach, &amp; come To taint another world? Where they display More Conquest gain'd by their own power alone, Then e'r y? Noble Laurell waited on. Welcome Thou wert at first, &amp; thought to be But tame &amp; honest poyson, which good Art Might mixe into a wholsomenes: but Wee Mistook thy power, whose cheife &amp; mightiest part Doth on y? Soule not on y? Body prey And can heal this, whilst that it doth destroy. Thou growst in India but upon y? ground, In England Thou in Humane Breasts art set. How will our generous Feilds henceforth confound Their Masters basenes! What our Earth would not Vouchsafe to foster, Men receive into Their hearts, &amp; spend their time to make it grow. Wert Thou y? Tree of Life, no greater care Could wait upon Thee: As brave Soules of old Chips of y? reverend Crosse about them wore, So we thy Relicks carefully doe fold And beare them ever with Us, as if Wee Safe under thy Leaves shade could onely be. And art Thou not a vapour full as vain As Man himselfe? O costly smoke, could We But estimate thy Nothing, we might gain A Virtue for our Prodigalitie, And spend in Incense Altars to perfume, What in thy empty stink We now consume. That Embleme which is stamp'd so plain in Thee Might well have frighted Us: A Mouth from whence Stream Fire &amp; Smoak, must needs a Copie be Of Erebus's black Jawes; yet some pretence Or others still we have y? Pipe to fill: Rather then part w?? thee wee'l look like Hell. All Virtues have their Charme &amp; Vices too, But no inchantment may compare with Thee: Who ever else without Devoto's goe, Yet still Thy potent Pipe will followd be. Incroaching Weed, which growst upon us thus: First We took Thee, now Thou Takest Us. About in Pounds &amp; Ounces dost Thou goe, By which we doe compute thy price &amp; worth. Was ever Nothing sold by weight till now, Or smoak put in y? Scale? But since thy birth Our subtile Age a difference hath found Between an Ounce of Nothing &amp; a Pound. But stay, I now recant. Poor herb, alas, Tis Wee incroach &amp; Tyrannize on Thee. Thou from thine India ne'r desirdst to passe, But captiv'd wert by our own Luxurie. Who keeps Thee a condemned helplesse Prize, And makes Thee dayly Her burnt Sacrifice. I know thou cheer'st y? Spirits, help'st y? Braine, Repell'st bad Aires, to Students art a Freind, If us'd w?? sober Reason: but our vaine Humor prevails; Our Selves &amp; Time We spend We know not why; Such is our Affectation, Our nose must smoak onely to be in fashion. A worthy fashion sure; y? French, they say, Those Universall Fashionmongers scorne This smoakie humor: And why may not They Heer too be our Example? Were We borne To copie all but their Sobrietie? Not France's Followers, but her Apes are Wee. Unhappy Wee! What Sun of Reformation Will chase these swarthy Clowds of smoak away, And cleare our Aire from this black Usurpation, Which robbs Us of our pure &amp; genuine Day! That so this Weed may in its proper use Be Physik, &amp; not Diet in abuse. Patience New come from Church (a Place where I Might have been fortifide All Tempests to abide) A Storme of News both foule &amp; high Blew in my Face, &amp; quickly beat Me over E'r a reflected thought I could recover. I had forgot this Age of lies, Wherin Fame's Trumpet now Y? in y? wars doth blow Sounds none but usefull victories, Mystick Defeats not gotten untill they Outface Us, &amp; our timorous Hopes betray. Yet what if Fame for once hath given To her owne Trade y? Lie, And spoke a Veritie? What if my Partie now be driven To flight, &amp; must expect another Day Wherin to pluck their most deserved Bay? Must I be Umpire, must y? Fate Of Mighty Armies be Waiting on my Decree? Is Heavns Command growne out of date, Or does not God much better know then I, Which Partie ought to reap y? Victorie? Sure He is Lord of Hosts, &amp; may Show Conquests where he please: Perhaps a Thorne agrees At this time better then a Bay With those, whom my fond &amp; unfriendly love Though They grow prowd, would still have Victors prove. Laurells a glorious Curse may be, Hells Legions are not Blessed because they put Poore Men sometimes to flight. Nay Wee Though Conquered, by humble Patience may Snatch Triumphs from their hands, who win y? Day. Let them Triumph: Still Truth &amp; Right Though beaten are y? best. Should these not be opprest Sometimes, our just suspition might Be questioning, whither they be not of kin To those faire Names, which mask our Enemies Sin. Patience, Great Lord, on us bestow; Palmes in our value far Nobler then Laurells are: So We may have this Prize, doe Thou Bestow y? Day on whom it pleaseth Thee: Patience is sure &amp; ample Victorie. The Check Troubled againe? Why surely Thou Art more rebellious now Then those Thou greivest at, whilst thy Unruly Will full against Gods doth flie. And foole, what can thy greiving doe? Will that torment thy foe? Or what will it advantage Thee, That Thou a Rebell gratis thus canst bee? Wer't not more noble to make Thine Owne will become Divine? Say freely thus: Gods Will be done, And then thou makest Thine &amp; His all one. So shalt Thou vex no more that they Thine Enemies win y? Day: But spend thy Greife on thine owne Sin, Which gave them cause to fight, &amp; strength to win. Life Alas poor Life, No more will I Miscall that foule Hypocrisie, By which Thou stealst y? dainty Face Of Sweetnes, and Dost men command To court and idolize thy borrowed grace. The Monstrous Mixtures temperd by Foule Fiends &amp; Wizzards Industrie Lesse guilty are of Mischeife, then Those Looks of thine, Which undermine With false inchantments Us beguiled Men. Thy Treason plainely I descry'd The other day by y? Beds side Of a young Friend of mine, which lay, Deep under thy Fierce Treachery: And much I envy'd Thee so sweet a Prey. Her Virgin Soule soft as her yeares A correspondent Body weares: O No; It wore of late, till Thou Didst it betray, And foundst a way To ravish those pure Sweets which there did grow. She had beheld twelve flowry Springs, And there a thousand blooming things Smiling in genuine braverie; But yet no feild Profest to yeild A Bud or Flower so soft, &amp; sweet as Shee. Yet fairer then her Looks She was In that internall Comelinesse Which drest her Soule, &amp; made it rise Much faster, then Her yeares did run Like to some forward Plant of Paradise. The Odours that She breathed, were Well-worthy to perfume y? Spheer Where Angels sing: Upon Her Toung Did nothing sit, But what might fit Their noble Quire, Some Psalme, or Sacred Song. All David was Her owne, writ deep In her soft Heart, which strove to keep That rich Inscription faire, each day For feare of rust And worldly Dust, She rubbd it o're, &amp; swept all harme away. Then on industrious Wings of Love After y? Eagles flight She strove And soone Shee reach'd no little part Of that highway, Nor ment to stay Till all his Gospell eccho'd in her Heart. But oh her gallant wings are now Cut short, &amp; she flags wondrous low. Found I not Her at highnoone day In Bed? whence Shee Was wont to be Risen before the Mornings earlyest Ray. I found Her there: If yet 'twere Shee: For sure Her barbarous Miserie Had forraged &amp; made such wast Of all y? Grace Which deckd her face That from her owne sweet selfe Shee seemed lost. Cold Palenes took its gastly seat On Her Soft Cheeks, (O how unmeet For such a Guest!) &amp; leaden Night Gan to surprize Those fainting Eyes Which lately sparkled with a Lovely light. Her Mouth of late y? roseall doore By which her purer Soule did powre Its Sweet Effusions, now begun To testifie Lifes Vanitie, And breath'd aforehand flat Corruption. A fiery fever to beguile The office of a Funerall Pile Seiz'd on Her, &amp; had quickly done Such Mischeife that Naught scaped, but An heap of bones wrap'd in a Milkie skin. Oh why may all sweet Flowrs, but Shee Prevent this worst of Miserie? The Lilly &amp; y? Rose when they Are stricken so, Have leave to goe And in their graves their yet whole beauties lay. But this poore Flowre must live to see The Death of all her Braverie And have no breath left to perfume Some Sacred Dittie: What mighty Pittie, That onely Sighs should such deare Blasts consume! Sad Heavy Sighs, or what is more Heavy then they, tumultuous store Of words as light as was y? winde That blew them out, As being brought Forth by an hoodwink'd &amp; abused Minde. For from y? Fevers raging Flame Such fumes &amp; troubled Vapours came, As did obstruct y? way betweene Her Heart &amp; Braine, Reason in vaine Strove to assert her selfe as Fancies Queene. Wild Fancie now y? Reines did guide, And through ten thousand by-wayes ride, Where shapeles shapes, &amp; Fantomes strayd, And all y? way More light then they She courted Shaddows, &amp; with Nothings playd. And all y? while her restlesse Toung Like an importunate Clapper rung, Ecchoing out y? Antik sound, Which her weak Braine Could not restraine. Was e'r so sad a Transformation found! Is this a Sceen of Life, where Shee Canno wayes her owne Owner be? But sees what ever could be said Lively &amp; quick E'r She fell sick, Both in her robbed Soule &amp; Body dead. Strange Life which makes her onely be Witnesse to her owne Miserie: Which doth not stop, but taint her breath: Which worse then killing, Is yet unwilling To grant her but y? Courtesie of Death. O Life, some other Title I Must print upon thy Treacherie. Life is a Name pure as y? Day And sweet as Light, But Thou like Night To blackest horrors dost poore Man betray. All Deaths, but Thou, are short, if wee Compare their close Epitomie To thy huge bulke: One Minute can Their torments measure, But thine take leisure To make of Thee Death in expansion. A Death, which lives to make us die So oft before our Destinie; A Death, which hath its yeouth &amp; Age, And weeks &amp; dayes And thousand wayes To make advantage for its lasting Rage. Out Spurious Thing. A place I know Where pure &amp; genuine Life doth grow: A Life, which lives; A Life most true To its great Name, Whose noble Flame Forever burnes, yet keeps forever new. A life, which unacquainted is With Paines, &amp; Sighs, &amp; Sicknesses; A Life, which doth no fever feele Unlesse it be The Ardencie Of Heavnly Love; a Sicknesse, w?? doth heale. A Life, which w?? Eternitie Doth in its Noble date agree: A Life, whose foot tramples y? Head Of all y? wee Still changing see, A Life, y? lives when every Death is dead. A Life that streameth from those Eyes, Whose beams embellish all y? skies; The Eyes of Joy, y? Eyes of Love Thine Eyes Dear Lord Which doe afford What ever maketh Heavn to be above. No hopes have I to live, untill My Soule in Thee doth take her fill, And from these Shades of Death doth flie To meet those Streames Of Living Beames, Whose everlasting East is in thine Eye. DEARE JESU, when, when will it bee! How long is this short Life to Mee, Which mocks Me thus! O when shall I (Peace fond Temptations Of carnall Passions.) Have leave to end this living Death, &amp; die! Faine would I die; but first be dead; Dead to those Sins, which murdered Thee on thy Crosse, &amp; which would doe The like to Me, Unlesse they be Well mortify'd before I hence doe goe. O who can slay all them for Me, But thy propitious Potencie, Which hath no other foes, but those! Tis Sin, &amp; none But Sin alone Which warrs with Man, &amp; which doth God oppose. O then revenge thy Selfe, y? I May conquer by Communitie Of Cause with Thee: some Succour give That I may bee Set safe &amp; free From this intestine Warre, &amp; I shall Live. Natalitium Martij 13, 1643. What rash &amp; hasty Things are yeares, w?? run So fast upon their ruine! To arrive At their owne Races end, is to be gone Quite into Nothing, never to survive. Poore I whose Life is much lesse then a Span, And vainer then a Dream, am yet alive, Whilst eight &amp; twenty long &amp; tedious yeares Have lost themselves upon y? whirling Spheares. I'v liv'd thus long said I? Let me unspeak That Word, more hasty &amp; more rash by far Then all those posting yeares: If I must make A true confession what my Fortunes are, I must leave Life to such as Live, and take With dull unworthy Things my proper Share. A Thing within tells me theres no denying; I have these eight &amp; twenty yeares been Dying. When to this lingring Death I first was borne All tainted with a deep annealed staine, Helplesse I lay, &amp; utterly forlorne; Untill my better Mother did Me deigne Her tender Bosome, &amp; to drowne y? Scorne With which my loathsome Birth did strive in vaine, Deep drenched me in a heavnly Fount, whence I Rose faire as new borne Light from Easterne Skie. My timely Grave oh could I then have found, I might have filld with unspotted Dust. But now I shall pollute whatever ground Must hide these Corps, o're grown w?? sinfull Rust. Sure my black sea of Crimes long since hath drown'd Whatever is in Mee, but my bare Trust In Him, who as He bounds all seas beside, Lo can He tame my Crimes high swelling Tide. What Kind of Sceen My Childhood was, nor I Can rightly judge, nor wiser Heads can say. Our tender yeares are a young Mysterie, The doubtfull Twi-light of a future Day: The Soule seems then scarcely arriv'd so high As y? Horizon: onely some weak Ray Steps out before Her, which may serve to be A Signe &amp; Item of Humanitie. But y? next Act Spectators well might see How strange a part my Soule was like to play. Young Crossnesse when it gets Maturitie May prove Rebellion: Who grieves to obey Small, petty Precepts, with lesse ease will be Pliant to great Commands: Another Day This Urchin which kicks at his Parents now, Gods more restrayning Yoak away may throw. The Rod at home drave Me to school, &amp; that At School to Study when I thither came. There like a Slave I wrought, &amp; when I gott License to play, though at some toilesome game As from some Gally-chaines, or Dungeons grott Me thought I rescu'd was: And then y? same Day, which six houres before was long &amp; slow Seem'd to get Wings, &amp; much too fast to goe. Th' importunate Drops at length some impresse made Upon my stony Intellect, &amp; I Was put Apprentice to y? Bookish Trade At full fifteene ith' Universitie. Where captiv'd in a Gowne, under y? shade Of thousand leaves I sate, and by The losse of almost all y? Time since then Have learned to be y? foolishest of Men. My itching mind proudly desir'd to prie Into whatever Learnings Title wore. With unfledgd Wings I often towred high, And snatch'd at things above my pitch, before I had sure hold of what beneath did lie. Yet on I ventur'd still, &amp; caught at more; I caught y? Wind of Words, w?? by a Blast Of following Notions soon away were past. At length I learn'd, &amp; sure my Tutor was Th' ETERNALL WISDOME, well to rest content With shallow knowledge of such Objects, as Can never blesse their Knower: Complement And Ceremonious Learning I let passe To guild their Crest, who make Applause their bent Ambitious onely not to be a foole In that, w?? Saints and Angells draws to Schoole. Mee though I felt some heats of Noble Love, And saw such glances of my Spouses face, As rap'd my heart, &amp; set it far above The Blandishments of any Mortall grace. But soone grown chill, degenerous did I prove And lost y? credit of that loftie place. Thus y? vaine Meteor, though exhaled farr In hopes of Heavn, proves but a falling Starr. But yet y? Starrs fall downe but once; whilst my Repeated falls in number far surpasse The Starrs all muster'd in y? clearest skie, And every Fall so bruiseth Me, alas, That in my Heart you easily may descrie Ten thousand all-black spots, whose hideous face Outlooks those few weak sparks w?? did remaine, And w?? a fatall Night my Soule did staine. This makes my blinded Mind to waver still In Matters of eternall Consequence; Which well I find doe far exceed y? skill Of Sinners to discerne, whose hoodwink'd sense Gropes but in things, whose grosser bulk can fill An hand of earth. None but thy influence Can guide my feet from wandring thus astray, Who art thy Selfe y? Candle, &amp; y? Way. O guide Me thou, Deare Lord, who in my Heart Dost read a simple &amp; unfain'd Desire To follow Truth &amp; Thee: I would not start For all this World from either, nor aspire To any Glory, but y? meanest part In thy Sweet Love, which will exalt me higher Then all these lying baits, that us invite In Dreames &amp; painted Nothings to delight. Let not my folly make me seem more wise Then thy Unerring Spouse, in whose Sweet Breast Thine owne Deare Spirit, y? Spirit of Wisdome lies, As Thou dost in thy Fathers Bosome rest. I shall be learn'd enough, if I can prize Humble obedient Knowledge as y? best. If I can understand but how to be A genuine Member of thy Church &amp; Thee. So shall I be content; though more sad yeares Still keep Me Prisoner heere; though furious Warre On every Minute heaps a thousand feares, And does all Comfort, &amp; all Hopes debarre, But what in Thy all-sweetning Face appeares. If Thy propitious Eye will be my Starre No Tempest shall deterre me, for no Sea Can swell so high, as is thy Heavn, &amp; Thee. Anniversarium Baptismi Martij 21. Welcome sweet &amp; happy Day: O let me pay In thy blest Light y? debt I owe The Fount, from which my better life doth flow. The Fount, which sprung from y? dear side Of Him, who dyde To leave a truer Life to mee Then I could draw from my Nativitie. For I was borne a Dying Thing: The Serpents sting Through all y? World y? went before Reach'd my poor Heart, &amp; poysned it all o're. Untill y? liquid Life, which swimms About y? brimms Of y? Baptismall Laver did Upon my Soule pure health &amp; vigor shed. Death soone was drownd, &amp; y? great weight Of Sin was strait Sunk to y? bottome, onely I Rose up, &amp; liv'd a Life, which could not die. It could not die, had I not been The treacherous Mean To murder it: Adam doth slay Us At first, but then none but our Selves betray Us. Pardon for this selfe-felonie I beg of Thee Who sheddst a rubie stream to heale Those second Wounds, my fainting Soule doth feele. So by thy Water &amp; thy Blood That double Flood Of Mercie, may my Heart swimme home And to y? Ocean of thy Glorie come. Mean time upon this Dayes fair face, By thy Sweet Grace This Vow I fix: NO MORE WILL I WHO SERVE TRUTH'S POTENT MASTER TELL A LIE. The Fashion I likewise might inamour'd be Of it, y? Fashion, could I see But what it is, &amp; how It comes to grow, But (like y? Phantomes of a troubled Head) Before tis finishd, tis quite vanished. But if it bred &amp; borne doth seeme In a fond antik Taylors dreame, It makes me wonder much How any such Unworthy spurious Brat should owned be By those, who scorne so vile a Pedigree: That Bodies of a comely Look A METAMORPHOSIS can brook From SHEERS &amp; NEEDLE, and Be at command Of every gew gaw fancie, that they meet 'Mongst other Butter-flies about y? Street. Search not for Substance, for y? Fashion Is Nothing else but Variation. And therefore Nothing. Yet So strong is it That ev'n this skin of Vanitie alone Makes in a yeare an hundred Men of One. Nor must you aske a Reason why Some Garbs professe Deformitie: It is enough if they Can plead &amp; say, Wee are y? newest Cut: the ugliest dresse Trimm'd w?? y? Name of Fashion, beauteous is. Thus Those whom Gods owne Hand had drest All In a Fashion of y? best, Are busied every day Trying how they By jaggs and cutts, &amp; restlesse Mending can Better His work, &amp; make a comelyer Man. And why, alas, must Pride &amp; Wee Thus Make our poor Mortalitie More Mortall then at first When it was curs'd? Was't not enough that one great Change We had But We must endlesse Transmutations add? Could We ever think We were But Fine enough, We would forbeare At last, &amp; rest in one Rich Garb; but none Can satisfie Prides Wanton affectation; Tis one great Fashion, still to change y? Fashion. Who for a week together is But like Him selfe can hardly misse The slander of a Clown: We scorne to own The Looks of Constancie, nor will We be Gentile, but by perpetuall Vanitie. Could our Forefathers cast their eye But on their gallant Progeny, Sure They would wonder how Our Isle could show So many forreine Nations, whose Array Such antik far-fetch'd difference doth display. Our Ancestors, from whose long Storie We gild our Selves with burrowed glorie, Should they but now come neere Our Presence heere The Porter would be chid for his foule Sin, Letting such country rusty Hindes come in. Wer't not as generous to agree, That everie Fashions standard be Erected fair &amp; high To each Mans Ey? And this DECORUM is, which best can tell Both Sordidnesse, &amp; wanton Pride to quell. Were not all fine enough, if Place And Birth defin'd our Habits Grace? For why should Men contend Still to ascend Above them selves in Clothes, &amp; guilty be Both of a vaine, &amp; dear selfe-mockerie? At least now Antik Wit &amp; Pride So many thousand Wayes have try'd; Let it Concluded be What Fashion We Must count y? best: Which if We may have leave, That, &amp; no other Fashion Wee'l receive. Love When LOVE Had strove Us to subdue, Whose Crime With Time Still bolder grew; Though Yee Said Hee, Will still Rebell, Yet I Reveng'd will bee, Sufficientlie Upon my Selfe for You, &amp; die. When LOVE Was wove And ty'd about His Crosse So close That it forc'd out A Flood Of Blood; I would I could, Sayes He, Forever bleed, So They who need This Blood, would fill their Cup from Mee. When LOVE Above Went up to sit Upon His Throne, He rain'd from it Whole Streames Of Flames On Those He Chose To goe To every Place Under Heavens Face And there Love's fierie businesse doe. When LOVE Doth move His sparkling Eye This way We may In it descry A Light More bright Then Day's Best Rayes, Wherby Our Hearts, although Chill untill now, Conceive an Holy Fervencie. When LOVE To prove His noble Art, His Bow Doth draw Against an Heart; Alwayes He slayes With Wound Profound, But still The Deaths they give Doe make Us live A sweeter Life, then that they spill. When LOVE A Grove Had sought, wherin He might Delight With Soules of Men, No Trees Could please His Will, Untill He spyd Faire Paradise, And heere, He cryes, My lovely Spouses shall abide. Loves Monarchie O mighty LOVE, Thou Universall Life &amp; Soule Whose Powers doe move And reigne alone from Pole to Pole, Give Me thy Worthlesse Subject leave to sing My due Allegiance to y? Worlds Sweet King. Let other Muses Goe court y? Wanton Mysterie Of lewd abuses Into a young Spruce Deitie: Mine does no homage owe, but unto Thee, Who, whilst y? other's blind, do'st all Things see. And sweetly by That golden Tide of Flames which flow Forth from thine eye, The Universe do'st garnish so That Sacrilege looks out at every eye Which into Thine its Wondring doth deny. Those glorious Flames, In which y? Quire above doth shine Kindle y? Beames Of all their Braverie at thine: Thou art That LOVE, whose heat together ties The Brotherhood of Heavns fair Hierarchies. Thou at y? first Into y? Sphears that warmth didst breath Which since hath nurst And fostered all Things beneath. The Heavns hug this our World, because thy Arme By its Supreeme imbraces keeps them warme. By heat from Thee The Elements doe kindly move: Ev'n Fire would be A cold dead thing, but for thy love: But Thou to Wedlock drawst them all, untill With Procreations they y? yeare doe fill. No Southerne Wind Or Westerne Gale blows on y? Springs; Onely thy kind And teeming Look new verdure brings: The Sun, because Thou send'st Him, neerer comes, And wakes cold Roots into their warmer Blooms. Nature could not In every Creatures Tribe &amp; kind Duely grow hot With fruitfull Flames, lesse Thine be joyn'd To teach them Life; All Births from Thee alone Doe grow, Who art Eternitie's great Sonne. Increase, saidst Thou, At first, &amp; Multiplie: with force That word did goe, And through y? World maintaine its course; Where still it springs, &amp; shall forever rise, Till weary Time it selfe growes faint &amp; dies. These honest are And genuine Fires: but those, whose flames Blush to appeare, Unlesse array'd in borrowed Names, Flow not from Thee: LUSTS stink, &amp; Looks doe tell That when most trimme, She's but dissembled Hell. The Law of Nations That Catholik Glue, which strongly bindes The widest Passions Of most discordant distant Mindes, Streames from thy liberall Love, which breathed then This Humane Rule, when first it breathed Man. That Countries can Their single scattred Might congest Into one Man, And crowne it there; is not y? least Reflection of thy loving Monarchie, In whom all Powers are Freinds, &amp; well agree. They who know how To marry Soules, &amp; make up one Bosome of two Work by no Charme, but thine alone; That Harmonie of Genius, which doth joine All other Friends y? Eccho is of thine. The mutuall Tide Of filiall &amp; parentall love, Which swells so wide That all y? World in it does move, Is but a drop of that delicious Sea Whose boundlesse Deeps ly treasur'd up in Thee. But yet of all Thy mighty Powers, none may compare With those which fall Upon soft yeilding Hearts, and Beare Them Captives after Thee, to fill y? Traine Of those sweet Conquests Thou on Earth dost gaine. Oh how Compleat Is thy Dominion in a Breast Which joyes to meet And kisse thy Scepter, which can cast It selfe away on Thee, and scorne to live, But by that Life thy blessed Eyes doe give! For from thine Eye It dayly drinks those living Flames Of Heavn, wherby Deliciously it breath's, &amp; frames All its Deportments by that golden Book, Whose Rules it reads in thy Majestik Look. And heere dost Thou Display thine absolute Monarchie, And not allow The conquer'd Heart its owne to bee. 'Tis not its owne: And yet by being Thine 'Tis more its owne, then if it still were mine. Mine, did I say? The ready Rhime made me too bold: Such Hearts as they Were those, which warm'd brave Breasts of old In y? fresh Spring of Pietie: But I In their chill lanquid Age, all frozen lie. And yet this Ice May capable of thawing bee If Thy pure Eyes Will glance their potent beames on Me. Forbid it, mighty King of Hearts, that my Poore Soule should not obey LOVE'S MONARCHIE. The Heart O mee! My enigmatik Heart How far am I from understanding Thee, Although thy first &amp; cheifest part Nothing but mine owne Understanding bee! Me thought Thou wert on Sunday last Deeply in love w?? Love's Heartwinning King, When Thou didst prudently forecast A Wreath of Virtues for thy Marriage Ring. And what was that Inchantment Thou In this bewitching World of Lies didst see? How did it dimme thy Sight, &amp; through A cheating Glasse make Heavn seem dark to Thee? Heavn seemed black, but Earth so bright That Thou with fond Desires didst court &amp; woo it: Forgot was Jesus, whose sweet light Draws all y? Seraphs wondring eyes unto it. What hast Thou gain'd Apostate Thing, What Joyes in thy new Love dost Thou imbrace? Whose every Part's a gilded Sting, A Death dissembled by an handsome face. How shall I be reveng'd! For I Cannot digest thus to be wrong'd by Thee: Must I indure that Thou, &amp; Thy Foule treacherie shall part my God &amp; Mee? Did I consent! How could it bee? My Lord, My Love, My Joy, my Happinesse My Refuge Jesus is, &amp; Hee Can never changed be from what He is. Surely 'twas onely Thou, and thy Besotted Passion w?? did Me betray, And as I slept awhile, did by Foule theft me from my Spouse remove away. Alas what maze is this, wherin I snarled am! Dwells there one Heart alone In this poor Breast; or do I 'gin Not to be I, but two strange Things in one? I did, yet I did not consent: No reason why I should; and yet I did: No I did not: I never ment My Jesus should from Me be severed: O Mee! I am confounded quite, Enforc'd w?? mine owne Heart to disagree. Jesu, Thou knowest me aright, My Heart is not so dear as Thou to Mee. How knotty is my Miserie, Who must mine owne Heart from my Bosome teare, Or from y? Mansion drive out Thee, Who hast best Title to inhabit there? Deare Lord of Love, I cannot live With this untoward traiterous Heart of mine: If Thou wilt Me a New one give, Thou shalt partake, it shall be mine &amp; Thine: Or rather Thine, and onely Thine: For I'm not to be trusted with an Heart; I kept not that, w?? once was mine, But Thou both carefull, &amp; Almighty art. Regard thy Worme, w?? heer lies spread Upon thy Footstoole, sighing out his paine: O tread not on his worthlesse Head, But Life into y? Dust breathe once againe. Conscience Treason Dread Soveraigne, Treason I discover And can produce y? Traitor too; My bosome works and boileth so, I cannot stop my Crie from running over. I know y? Man (if so his treacherous Sin Blots not that faire ingenuous Name) Who lately to a Parlie came With Thee, &amp; learn'd by yeilding, how to win. He yeilded to thy Mercie, &amp; therby Happily won Himselfe; and Thee; Thou wert His Captive, He was free, And might have been so to Eternitie. But from y? freedome of thy service Hee, Proud foole, and Traytor as he was, Soone after did desire to passe, And reinslave him selfe to Vanitie. O hasten to reduce him, lest he grow A sturdie Rebell: now his Crime Is young &amp; greene, take him in time, And one sweet Conquest more on him bestow. Loe in thy presence heere He is, nor can I him conceale; loe heere he lies Press'd downe with his Iniquities; O look this way: Alas, I am the Man. Will Had I my Will, I would—. And what Would y? Wretch doe had he his will? Why then I would not have it, that I might be sure to keep it still. Alas, I have it not; my vaine Affections doe it posesse: Indeed they keep it in a chaine Of seeming silk &amp; tendernesse. But oh they pull &amp; hale it to Objects so ougly and so vile, That whilst perforce I forward goe, Frighted I start, &amp; back recoile. Sometimes I courage take &amp; crie, Foule Rebells, know you what you doe? My Will is your Liege Lord, &amp; I Unlesse I will, will never goe. But then they gently fawne &amp; smile, And with soft charmes cast me asleep. By which delitious potent guile Still their Usurped power they keep. Thus like a royall cheated slave I hold y? Empire of my Will; That Others Hands my sword may have, And when they please, their Soveraigne kill. But oh had I my Will indeed, How would I reigne at home in State! W?? noblest Pleasures would I feed All my Desires, &amp; feed them fat. My Subjects all I would command, And instantly obeyed be; My Faculties should ready stand Attending on my Majestie. Anger should wage my Warrs, &amp; fight Against my Rebell Lusts, which now Upon my weaknes vent their spight, And chaine me downe to things below. Then LOVE upon his gallant wing My weighty Embassie should beare And deale w?? Heav'ns Almighty King About my Suit depending there. That Suit concernes a Match w?? my Deare Spouse, y?, Prince of Sweetnes, who Long since has had my Heart, &amp; I Would fain this businesse on might goe. Had I my Will, it should goe on; But then I would not have my Will: Dear Lord it should be Thine alone, And so my best Desires fullfill. Had I my Will, I would resigne It into Thine, &amp; change with Thee, So from mine owne, I would gaine Thine, And then mine owne mine owne should be. The Net Dear Jesu, oh how carefull is Thy Love, Which meets me every where! Into y? Feild no sooner did I move, But it was ready there. Ready to use, &amp; catch me in that Net, A Fowler there by chance, for Birds had set. I heard y? Fowler, &amp; his brac'd Decoyes Stretch their alluring voice; Which when y? unsuspitious Birds did heare, They sporting flutter'd neere; This was enough; up flew y? Net &amp; they Fell downe as fast, y? greedy Fowlers prey. Had they still kept aloft in their pure spheare, And sung their Vespers there, They might have sup'd in quiet, &amp; have gone Safely to roost anon. But gadding wantonly too neere y? ground, Onely y? way into their grave they found. Take warning then my Heart: this Earth below All thick with snares doth grow. This Net hath caught Me, &amp; convinc'd me so That there's no saying No. If Hearts but hover neere y? Dust, straitway The Serpent, that dwells there, makes them his prey. Discredit not those active Wings of thine, Whose flight should be divine. The Region of thy busines is above, In y? cleare Orbe of Love, Where Thou with Birds of Paradise mayst sing And on y? Tree of Life mayst rest thy Wing. Faith Illustrious Mayd, what foule Idolatrie Grows big &amp; impudent under thy faire Name! Yea They, whose throats stretch'd w?? loud Zeale, decry Ev'n harmlesse Usefull Pictures, are y? same Double-fac'd Men, whose bold hypocrisie One Idoll makes for all, &amp; sets up Thee. They set Thee up, &amp; then they hold Thee fast, Lest left unto thy Selfe Thou tumble downe: Faire Hands, &amp; Armes (but not their use) Thou hast For they, as Thou thy selfe, are not thine owne: Two feet they give Thee, but not one to goe; Was ever Heathen God more stock then so! Yet in this Stock they put their desperate trust, To yeild them Life immortall when they die. Besotted Soules, ev'n your owne mouldring Dust Is lesse of kin unto Mortalitie Then this vaine God, who surely cannot give Life unto you, unlesse it selfe did live. How often has it falln, &amp; broken layn Before y? Ark of Truth! oh wast no more Your Arguments to naile it up againe, And fit it for new falls: upon y? floore All broken as it is, still let it ly: Better that rot, then you its Makers dy. And rot it will. But genuine Faith doth lead A brisk &amp; active Life, a Life of Fire: For Love Her Brother is, &amp; that pure Breed With restlesse action all to Heavn aspire; No Flames w?? more unwearied fervencie Heave up their labouring hands to reach y? skie. When e'r Shee comes abroad, close by her side To keep her warme, her sparkling Brother goes; And then her bounteous Armes spread far &amp; wide Let none escape her, whither Friends or Foes. Her Rule is, All; &amp; by none else will Shee Frame y? dimensions of her Pietie. She alwayes busy is with hand &amp; Heart To help her Followers in at Heavns strait Gate: Nor ever failes Shee to performe her part, Unlesse they lagg &amp; tire, &amp; come too late. If this Gate once be shut, Faith must not hope Though She could Mountaines move, to thrust it ope. Through all y? billows of this working Sea, This Life of Waves &amp; Tempests, She doth guide Our tender crazie bark; y? safely We Past y? huge rocks of black Despaire may ride. In vaine y? winds conspire lowd war to wage; Cast anchor, HOPE, says She, &amp; let them rage! The Church &amp; Sacrament She doth frequent, But cares not greatly for y? Subtile Schoole; Humilitie's her Wisdome: She's content Though saucy Syllogismes conclude her foole. Logik has no such reason to despise This simple Maid, could it but use its eyes: For at Her conquering feet it might descry Whole Legions of venturous Arguments Disarm'd, &amp; trampled downe: No Heresy Did e'r rebell against Her, but repents, And there confesses, that what ever were Their Premises, Conclusions make for Her. The Scepter that She beares, though rude &amp; plaine, Yet strikes this terror through Her proudest foes; It is of Wood, w?? Blood all dye'd in graine A downright Crosse, not unto her, but those That dare both Her &amp; It. Doe you not see How at its Shadows they incensed bee? Though Shee be strong &amp; mighty, She doth love Calme gentile Peace, &amp; humble Patience: No grudgings, jealousies, or wrongs can move Her to oppose superior violence: For when to Tyrants Shee her neck layes downe, Tis onely that their Hands her Head may crowne. Be Princes Monsters, if they will, says Shee, What's that to Me? A Lamb my Soveraigne is; Though in his Hand there dwelt all Potencie, He ne'r drew Sword against y? wickednes Of authorized Men, or claim'd from them Their Power, as forfeit, by their sin, to Him. O Sacred Maid, for ever cursed be Heretik &amp; scismatik violence, Which labour to deflow'r thy Puritie. My Heart's too vile to be thy Residence; But Thou art meek &amp; kind, &amp; wilt not scorne To make a Soule grow faire, which was forlorne. H. Sacrament Love, upon a deep designe How He might poore Wormes combine With his Heavnly Selfe, &amp; twine Dust into a state Divine. Did borrow frailty of a chosen Maid, And with our Flesh &amp; Blood himselfe array'd. What He once had borrowed, Hee Ment to keep eternally, Yet in debt He would not be Unto poore Humanitie. But e'r He went to Heavn, contrived how To beare it hence, yet leave it still below. Moulded up in Mystick Bread And into a Chalice shed, Flesh &amp; Blood He rendered: Ordering We should be fed With this high Diet, &amp; incorporate Againe w?? Him, who had assum'd our State. Bounteous Jesu, thou hast more Then discharg'd thy loving score: And we, richer then before, Happily find our selves most poor; We never can repay this love of thine; God ran in debt, to make Man prove Divine. If our selves our offring be, Thou wantst not Humanitie: Love forstalled halfe what wee With most right might offer Thee. We yeild, Great Lord, Thou hast subdue'd Us quite, And unto Thee belongs ev'n our selfe-right. Surely then We will not spare This Angelik Soveraigne Fare Seing Thine we wholly are. For if still our owne we were How could we venture? But now Thine we be, Make Us as happy as it pleaseth Thee. Loves Adventure Love once a wooing went, &amp; tride To winne Himselfe a Rurall Bride: His robe of State He layd aside And clad in homely country weeds, he took For his bright Scepter a plaine shepherds Crook. Nor was't some Masque y? He intended, But in good earnest thus He rended Through Heavn his passage, &amp; descended, Where in a Stable His first Bed He made: What Shepherd ever playner Lodging had? There meeting w?? his Love, arrayd In equall Habit (for y? Maid Was Humane Nature) He assayd To captive Her affections by all arts That Love can trie upon beloved Hearts. By Blandishments of Tongue &amp; Eye, By many a tear &amp; many a sigh, He strove her Soule to mollifie. No dowry He required, yet was content. To jointure Her in Heavn, would shee consent. But proud &amp; coy Shee scorned his Love, And with resolved denyall strove Her peremptory Heart to prove As hard as His was soft: No spouse sayes Shee, But one thats great &amp; gallant is for Mee. (As if some rare piece She had been Of Beautie, or of Fortune Queen, And not a lump of Dust, as meane As He is Great: Had Pride not made her blind, In's Miracles She might his Godhead find). This cruell Word's unworthy Dart Strook deep in Love's most tender Heart Yet was too weak to make him start From his sweet enterprise: I have sayd He As good an aime; &amp; darts as sharp as Shee. With that ten thousand times He shot; But Shee all flint &amp; steele would not Yeild to one wound; which made Him plot An amorous vengeance, &amp; brave tryall make Seing Life could not, by Death her Heart to break. I'l dye, He cryes, I'l soundly dye By mine owne mortall wounds I'le try To make her bleed, &amp; venture by My languishment &amp; death to make Her prove The dainty languishments, &amp; deaths of Love. Good as this Great Word up he flyes Unto his Throne of Miseries, Where fastened by his wounds, he cryes Was ever Griefe like Mine, who here must dye For Love of Her, who doth my Love defye? And now His conquered Spouse does yeild Unto her Lord his bloody field, Who both Himselfe &amp; Her hath killed: His most convincing Death it selfe did dart Into her breast, &amp; slew her hardned Heart. And now by Love's Life shee doth live, Which dying He to her did give, And doth with loyall fervour strive To quit that mighty Score, &amp; to repay Him to Him selfe, upon their Wedding Day. For He reviv'd againe &amp; now Waits till y? Church be drest below, That He againe his Face may show Not now in Servile, but Majestik guise His Nuptiall Feast Princelike to solemnize. A Love bargaine O love, how faine my Heart would dye, To live with Thee! But every day Temptations ly In ambushment, &amp; steale my heart away. Surely were I but I, no bait Could from thy gentill Lure invite me: But some Deceit Or other's allwayes ready to delight me. Ah poore Delight, w?? does no more But tickle me untill I run From y? safe shore Of Thy Restraint into y? Sea of Sin. Where oh how oft had I been drown'd Had not thy Graces blessed beames Look'd forth &amp; found My shipwrack'd Heart amidst y? helplesse streames. But there thy everwatchfull eye Ope'd wide &amp; shew'd it selfe to Me That fainting I Againe unto y? Shoare my Way might see. Sweet Ray of Love, no Marriner So much salvation ever ought The Polar Star As for my sinking Soule thy Light hath wrought. Confirme thy rescue Lord, that I No more may feele Temptations spight, Or constantly By thy strong hand repell their treacherous Might. So my Song Shall be long To no praise, but Thine: So my Heart Ne'r shall start Back from being Mine. Mine, yet still At Thy will, For thy will should be Soule, &amp; more Then before Selfe was unto Mee. So each Line Shall be fine With thy beauteous Name, Whilst my Muse Doth refuse Vaine Pernassu's fame. LOVE can be Poetrie, And each verse grow brave Where an Heart W?? true art JESUS doth ingrave. Never sound Did rebound From y? Sphears like this: Peace all other Sweets together Musik JESUS is. The Death of y? Life of Love O mighty LOVE, well may thy Glorious Throne Be high erected on subdued Hearts; Whose onely Shade, &amp; faint Reflection, With Life &amp; Death annoints its mystik Darts! But yesterday I did attend upon Its solmne Triumph carryed on an Herse, As now I second that Procession By borrowing feet of my Admiring Verse. Twas y? Unfortunate Body of a Mayd Whom unsuccessfull Love had slowly slaine: A generous Soule, &amp; lesse of Death afrayd, Then of her long Beloved's proud disdaine. In y? sinceer Munificence of Love She freely did resigne Him all her Heart: And He, awhile seem'd not in debt, but strove To answer Her in Bountie's dearest art. But afterward cold &amp; disdainfull growne, Her loyall Heart away He carryed quite; For Shee would not receive it as Her owne, Having by deed of gift made His y? right. And thus deprived of Life's onely Fount Her owne soft Heart, &amp; allso His, wherin She hope'd to find Her owne, she well might count The first part of Her Death did heer begin. And so it did: for sighing out her dayes In languishments of unregarded Love, By secret dainty Torments she decayes And Death's unwilling Forces doth improve. She so improves them, that they now befriend Her w?? their finall stroke, &amp; send her hence, One out of Love w?? Life, w?? would not lend Her love againe to quit her Love's expense. Dear JESU, if these Mortall Loves can be Stronger then Death, what are y? Powers of Thine; How shall we measure its immensitie, Which, like thy selfe, compleatly is Divine! No wonder that brave Soules of Fire, w?? are Kindled by thy Love's living Flame, can give Defiance at y? blackest Deaths, &amp; dare On any termes Venture with Thee to live. No wonder that those amorous Hearts, w?? be Their owne no longer, but intirely thine, So pant &amp; gasp, &amp; languish after Thee Till Thou unto their high desires incline. The Rose smiles not w?? fragrant braverie On them, but onely Prickles forth doth bring: They nothing can in y? Hyblean Bee Discover, but an angry venom'd Sting. Their Palates relish no such things, as We Doe Dainties call: No earthly Glorie's blaze Bears theirs contemptuous Puffe: No Gold can be So bright, as to allure their eyes to gaze. Life holds them on y? rack, whilst heer they stay, Far from y? Life, by w?? their Soules doe live: No Cup of Sweets can their great thirst allay, But what y? wished hand of Death doth give. For Thee they thirst, for Thee the Spouse of Hearts, For Thee all Faire, all Lovely, &amp; all Love; For Thee, who art not proud, but by these arts Of kind delayes, their loyalty doth prove. For Thee they thirst, &amp; burne in this their Thirst, Till by strong Sighs their Soules exhaled be; As Clouds of Incense from y? Altar burst Taking their course towards thy Heavn, &amp; Thee. Brave lovers these indeed, whose Herses I Would gladly follow; but doe more desire To trace their living loving steps, &amp; by Their Way unto their journeys end aspire. But for thy Love, Dear Savior could I die? Me thinks I could, if I but worthy were; Surely this World's not worth my Love: yet I Trust not my Selfe, but hang on Thy Sweet Care. The two Fires Depart from Me yee Cursed into everlasting Fire, prepared for ye Devill &amp; his Angells. S. Mat. 25. 4I. And surely Lord Thou knowest best, Who didst that Fornace make; Though venturous damning Men contest, And thy Decrees doe break. O why should Wee ordeine that Fire For Man, which Thou at first For Devills kindle'st, &amp; conspire With them to be accurst! Fire of another mixture Thou For Man prepared hast, More hot then that in Hell below, And which as long may last: Delitious Fire, whose fuell is Thine owne all-sweetning Graces, Flames of eternall Love &amp; blisse Of ravishing Imbraces. And that we might be sure to be Its Sacrifices, Thou Thy Selfe didst kindly come &amp; see It kindled heer below. Whence, when Thou wert returned, Thou Thy potent Spirit didst give, Which on our Hearts mightst breathe &amp; blow And keep y? Fire alive. What couldst Thou more! If we reject Our proper FLAMES, sure none But that STRANGE FIRE we can expect; For burne we must in One. Novemb. 5. 1644 O no Mischeivous Spirits, it cannot be That all Hell should at once break out, y? yee Should let Confusion lose, &amp; by An absolute Impietie Leave Antichrist Himselfe no way How Hee y? King of Monsters may Approve Himselfe, &amp; by some gallant sin Usher y? whole Worlds dreadfull Dissolution in. Your Plot is layd too deep: oh it would rend Hells lowest bowells out, &amp; fouly blend Them with Heavns beauteous face. You might Have been content w?? finite spight, And chose some Treason that might not The whole Worlds former Traytors blot Out of their Catalogue; you might have bin Cursed enough, had you but copied some old sin. It must not be: Heavn has a thousand Wayes To undermine your vault, and can with ease Blow up your plot it selfe; but yet Its infinite Wisdome thinks it fit That you, The Traytors onely bee Traytors to your owne Treacherie; That your owne hand &amp; pen y? way may write Your deep Designe of Darknes how to bring to light. O may that Vengeance, w?? now sits on You Heavy &amp; sure, its Wholesome terrour throw On their foule Zeale w?? labour by Full streams of blood to purifie, And to reforme, what cleanly they Esteeme polluted: Must y? Way Of Puritie be purged by a staine, And that of Scarlet's deepest Die a Sin ingraine? Surely this is a Treason too, whose bent's Not y? two Houses but two Testaments To undermine, &amp; at one blow Both Root and Branch to overthrow; To make both Law &amp; Gospell be Pliant to lawlesse Fervencie; To rend y? Lambs skin, &amp; to make his Fleece Blush all in Blood, w?? ought still to be white in Peace. The Diet Last night my Supper, as I fed, Sufficed not but changed quite My Stomack, &amp; in Secret led It to a Table Compleatly able To satisfie the largest Appetite. What are these Meats &amp; Drinks below, But things as vaine &amp; fraile as Wee? By which We grow indeed, but grow Neerer each day To that Decay Which must consummate our Mortalitie. Wee feed but on these Things, untill Ourselves become fit meat, wherby The Grave her gaping Mouth may fill; Where finallie Our Meats &amp; wee In one Corruption swallowed up must lie. Could any earthly Dainties teach Us how to live indeed, sure I; Could there Devoto turne, &amp; preach For them, &amp; none But them alone, Nor any Doctrine presse, but Gluttonie. I could on silly Womens Zeale Grow fat, &amp; at their Tables end Uses &amp; Exhortations deale Wherby they might Both Noon &amp; Night Meat &amp; Drink-Offrings on GOD BELLY spend. The Reprobates I could Decree To have no Right, but those alone Who Godly are, to all we see Daintie &amp; sweet And fatning Meat; Taking for granted, that my Selfe were One. All Fasting Dayes I could despise And prove a Fryday-Capon were A purer, holyer, Sacrifice Then Abstinence And Penitence, And such vexatious Superstitious geare. But oh! Those Viands onely can The Belly fill; but know not how Indeed to satisfie y? Man. Man's not w? We Heere feeding see; The Soule's y? Man, &amp; that must feed &amp; grow. Unbounded is its Appetite, And boundlesse Diet doth require; Meats of unmeasured delight Which allway fill It full, yet still Leave room for Hungers ever fresh Desire. JESU, no Diet can suffice, But what Thine, owne Magnificence Provided hath above y? Skies. Thou, who didst make This Hunger, take Some course to stop its burning violence. Long in this weary world have I Trembled &amp; toss'd, &amp; nothing found But husks, which cannot satisfie My hungry Heart: Faine would I part From hence, whence naught but nothing does abound. But if I must not die as yet, Alive do Thou this Hunger keep: By Faith &amp; Hope oh nourish it Till at y? last This long, long Fast By Thy sweet grace an endlesse Feast shall reap. Censure O no! I'm sure it was presumptous Pride; Poore Heart ther's no excusing it: Not all y? Wit Of Philautie can serve this swelling blot to hide. Though some to shun a Tempest's Molestations Made choise of Shipwrack; &amp; drunk up In a New Cup Rank Poyson to prevent a Fevers short Vexations: Thou hadst no reason to insult &amp; ride In Triumph over Those, who were Throwne downe by feare: With other Sins They made a Covenant, Thou w?? Pride. Had strong Temptations flowne so thick on Thee Perhaps Thou wouldst have sunk: it was The Gale of Grace, Not Thine owne Spirit, which made Thee saile in safetie. O tremble then, when Thou beholdest Others Fearefull of anything, but sin, Lest Thou begin By Pride to share in that Offense, which was thy Brothers. In HUMBLE FEARE let all thy strength be layd, For Pride's but at its highest rise Big Cowardice. Hell fears no Pride, but is of HUMBLE FEARE afrayd. Wishes Now I have Mind &amp; leisure To trip a chearly Measure; DESIRE, come freely hither, And tell Me plainly, whither Thy Wishes come not thronging, And make Thee big w?? longing. Dos't hanker after Pleasures, The Bellys lazie Treasures, Which there will rot before Thee, And with Corruption store Thee, Providing quicker breeding For Wormes &amp; fatter feeding? Such belly Amunition Maintaines but y? Physitian, And howsoe'r it pleases, Cheats Thee into diseases. Doe Gold &amp; Silver woo Thee? Abundance will undoe Thee. The Metall's sad; be warie, How much thou striv'st to carry: ENOUGH is vaster Treasure, Then Wealth, y? knows no measure, Which Dropsie-like, may kill thee, And split, but never fill thee. To Honours gaudy splendor Couldst thou thy selfe surrender, And court y? glittering graces Of high commanding Places? Where flattering Eyes devotions Will wait on all thy motions, And foulest vices garnish With Virtue's forced Varnish; Where Envie's disaffections Will blast thy fairest actions, And in ten thousand Places Will undermine thy paces, Painting in thy confusion A falling stars conclusion. Doe Wedlock's Looks invite Thee In chast Sweets to delight Thee? But what if thou dost marry Millions of Cares, &amp; carry Thy single Freedomes Treasure Into a Chaine for Pleasure, Of which sole Death can ease Thee; A Friend, which scarce will please Thee? What, does thy Study lure thee Within it to immure thee? And stow up thy Provision Of learned Ammunition? Alas vaine Project, Plunder Has broke that Plot in sunder: Cambridge, thy genuine Mother, Is force'd to be no other But step-dame, &amp; reject thee, Though once she did elect Thee. Tis well, God doth not fashion By Man's, his Reprobation. Tis well, thy new &amp; Noble Society doth double Thy Comfort: gallant Spirits (Men of abused Merits) With Thee are Reprobated: Seing then Thou art estated In this brave Losse, no matter, This FELLOWSHIP'S y? better. Wouldst, if thou couldst come by it, Thy Living hold in quiet, And by its Profits, treasure Up fuell for thy Pleasure? Fondling, how thou mistakest Thy happiness, &amp; makest Thy gaine thy Losse! Th' ast gained Not to be spent &amp; pained With Mystik Cares: Most mighty Hero's who knew y? weighty Burden of Soules, have faster Fled from y? Name of Pastor Then unfledge Brats now hasten Upon this charge to fasten: Well now I see that Wishing, Is but halfe way to Missing; E'n wish no more: I'l tell thee A certaine course to fill thee With all, thy Heart can covet; Choose but Gods Will &amp; love it, So shall thou be assured Thy Wish will be procured; For no Crosse then can spight Thee Thy Will being grown Almightie. S. Andrew Farre on his Manly shoulders had the Saint Carry'd his Masters mightie Crosse: nor Thrace Nor spatious Scythia ever saw Him faint, But on He marched still, &amp; march'd apace. The dark Barbarians wondered at y? Sight, And cast their conquerd Hearts all in his way Whilst in their Northern Superstitious Night They saw y? Rise of a Meridian Day: A Day, w?? ought its East, not to y? East But to y? South, to priveleg'd Palestine: The Christian Day full Southern is, &amp; drest With highnoon rayes, when first it ginns to shine. And now, said Heavn, though He would still goe on, Wee must relieve Him for Our Honours sake: Be then his LOAD his EASE; let Him upon The Crosse his Chaire of earned Triumph take. Nor shall Aegeus, though Proconsul He, Disdaine to help Him up upon His Throne: In proudest Rome ne'r did Aegeus see So fair a Triumph, nor so long a one. Nayld fast unto his Honour is y? Saint, Arrayd in Scarlet from his owne rich veines. Mistake not Pagans; tis no torturing Paint Nor is this Crosse a Throne of Soveraine Paines. Draw neer &amp; hearken; does He there bewaile Himselfe, or you? Craves He your Lenitie, Or offers help to your lethargik Aile? Fast are You nayld to Danger, He is free. And to his freedome He invites you all. How sweet sit Heavn &amp; JESUS on his Toung! Whilst from His Lips full Streames of Life doe fall, No words which to a dying Man belong. Oft had He preachd, but never climbd till now So fit a Pulpit, where y? World might see What sweet fruit on that bitter Tree can grow This Noble Pulpit preachd as well as He. Long was His Sermon, for his last it was. Two dayes it measur'd &amp; yet seem'd but short. What are two poore &amp; flitting dayes, alas To that which doth Eternity import? And am I nayld in vaine, Deare Lord, said He Unto this Pillar of renowned Death! Though not poore I, yet Thou deserv'st for Me That in this honour I may yeild my breath. Up flew these Words, &amp; downe there flew as fast For His Sweet Convoy an illustrious Light: With which from this dark world y? Saint made haste And to his Lords Deare Bosome took his flight. Where for Aegeus with Requests more warme Then was his reeking Blood, he strongly prayes; And labouring that red Crie asleep to charme, The Tyrant for his Crosse He well repayes. S. Thomas I must not praise Thee that Thou tardy art In crediting thy Lords Miraculous Rise Yet must I thank Thee, for my Heartned Heart By this thy tardiness more nimbly flyes. My faithlessnes prevented is by Thee, And by thy Tongue, e'r I was borne, I said I'l not believe He's Risen, till I see Those Prints which by the Spear, &amp; Nailes were made. By thine, my Finger tryd each reverend Wound, By which each Hand of Mercy broached was: By thine, my hand express admission found Where y? lesse cruell Spear before did passe. With Thee, by those three Mouths of Goodnes I Confuted was, &amp; could not chuse but yeild. He who could conquer Death, whilst He did dye, Of Us might easily, living, win y? Feild. By thine, my Tongue did clear Confession make, Whilst further then my hand my Heart did prie, And from my Lips thy Eccho still doth break My God, my Lord, for ever will I crie. S. Johan. ad Port. Latin (To a Base &amp; 2 Trebles.) Foolish Tyrant, spare thy cost, All thine Oile &amp; Labour's lost: This is a Seraph all on fire; Oile will but feed his Flames up higher. If Thou would'st kill Him, let Him live: Death his best Life to Him will give. Foolish Tyrant Who anoint'st thine Enemie Too strong before for Hell and Thee; And dost for streams of Torments, shed Soft Oile of Gladnes on His Head. SS. Innocents Day (To a Base &amp; 2 Trebles.) Goe Roseall Budds of Martyrdome, In Paradise goe take your rome; Where you may flourish, &amp; not fear That Herods Sword can cropp you there. Your little LORD that scapes to-day All yours in richer Blood will pay: First let Him grow, &amp; fill his veins Whose Blood must wash the whole Worlds staines. Epiphanie Oblation (To a Base &amp; 2 Trebles.) Our Gold, rich King of Povertie, Our Incense Infant Dietie, Our Myrrh for thy Humanitie, And Our poore Selves we bring to Thee. In Us our East is hither come. To meet thine Eyes, its fairer Home. O let this Gold wait on thy Crowne: This Incense let thine Altar owne; And this Myrrh on thy Tomb be throwne: And our East be thine Eyes Sweet Dawne. So shall our other East &amp; We Adore no Sun, but onely Thee. The Admirable Conversion of S. Paul Acts 9. Athirst againe? But even now Stev'ns Sacred veines were broached, whence Thou Tookst thy full draught, &amp; left'st y? Saint No more then servd his wounds to paint. Thy bloody Mouth still blusheth in Confession of that reeking sin: And needs some other liquor now, To wash that stain. O didst Thou know The vertue of y? Springs, which rise In a true Penitent Sinners Eyes, Those streams y? better thirst of thy Inflamed Soule would satisfie, And washing her deep staine away Up unto Heavn thy Heart convey (How foule soever it came hither) As faire as His Thou Stoned'st thither. But of all Liquors onely Blood Quenches not thirst; its Purple Flood All though but moderate whilst at home, Most Fiercely burnes when it doth come Abroad, &amp; in all veines is knowne To turne to fire, but in its owne. Look how y? furious flame doth break Vers. 1 From Sauls impatient Mouth, &amp; speak Its proper language, fire &amp; sword Against y? Followers of y? Lord: That Lord, whose blood, if any, might Have quenchd Mortalls immortall Spight. But Furies thirst, still thirsty can Exhaust y? Blood of God &amp; man. But whither now? Why to y? Priest? He is a Man, &amp; in his Breast There something lesse perhaps may dwell Then perfect Tigre: down to Hell And get thy desperate Commission Under y? Broad Seale of Perdition. There Thou shalt have both thanks &amp; pay And new fire to thy Zeale: away, A prince will help Thee there, &amp; be Captaine of thy Conspiracie. No: heers a shorter Passage: Saul Can meet Him in y? High Priests Hall, Where y? black Warrant first was pennd JESUS him selfe to apprehend. And 'tis decorum now, sayes He, That none but this Authoritie Which did that foule Imposter take, Should seize his Followers, &amp; make The Glory wholly yours; that you Most Holy Sir, should overthrow That Rout w?? dares oppose y? Grace Of Moses evershining face; Which dares blasphemously preferre Poor Tabors forged Lustre far Before those dreadfull beames, w?? did Break out from Sina's glorious Head. Let these resumptious Rebells know Moses is still alive in you; And as in His great Chaire you sit, So His all-powerfull Rod is put Into your Hand. Had that proud He The Master of this Heresie, Been kept close to his honest Trade, Surely he never could have had So many Prentises. But, Sir, Is it not time for Zeale to stir Now their vile Carpenters new Art Hath built his Fabrik in y? Heart Of y? deceived People higher Then doth our Temples crest aspire? Now that Mechanik Doctors Law Out braves our reverend Statutes? Now The cursed Crosse usurps to be Of Life &amp; Blessednesse the Tree By His profound Inchantment? O (Seing They themselves will have it so) Envy them not that Glorie's shame; Let every one obteine y? fame Of their Lords Death: Such honour I To no Blasphemer would deny. If You can undertake to find Crosses enough, let Me have sign'd Your warrant, &amp; no feare, but I Will Heretiks enough descry For you y? righteous Priest to offer Upon those Altars; They can suffer Upon no fitter Engin; you No better Offring can bestow Upon that God, which doth decree Strict Death for lesser Blasphemie. And if y? Romans will not Yeild By tumult We will win y? feild. Eas'ly was this Comission got And Saul well mounted on a hot And fiery Steed (though not so fierce As He himselfe) sets on his course Damascus way. What hardy He Dares stop y? Man? Authority And zeale both spur him on. I ride Upon Heavns errand; on my side Is both y? Highest Priest, says He, And that Priests Highest Dietie. Why starts y? Gallant? O hee's downe Both Horse &amp; Man are overthrowne: Vers. 3. A Light shining with much more day Then y? compleat Meridian Ray Arrests Him in his way unto His work of darkness; &amp; doth show A higher Priest then He, from whom His proud Commission doth come. It showes y? Carpenter to be Maker of Light &amp; Majestie, At which those late disdainfull eyes Shrink into Blindnes. Now Saul spies Without his Sight, what untill now He could not see, or would not know. O happy Blindnes! Christ before Call'd divers, whilst He did restore Their Sight: but here He doth begin By Blindnes Proselytes to win. It is enough, if to y? Eyes Of Mans dark heart Day does arise. But hearken Saul, thine ears are ope; The way of Faith Christ would not stop. Hark, 'tis not angry Thunders tone But y? soft Voice of Love alone. Vers. 4. SAUL, SAUL. And why not Rebell, who Against his King rides armed so. O no: tis Love y? speaks, &amp; He By Sweetnes will a Conqueror be. Why persecut'st Thou Me? Can I Offend my Creature, who did die To win its love? What wouldst Thou more, Then what I freely gave before? My Heart resignd Thee all her blood Which once alone can do Thee good. Seek not to ravish it againe Out of my Mystik Bodies veine, Out of my tender Church which I Have chose to be its Treasurie. Alas thy Stomach doth in vaine My milde Humilitie disdaine: Were I still crownd w?? Thornes, ev'n those Would prick &amp; vex my proudest Foes. But now that wreath I have layd downe, And reassum'd my Royall Crowne, Whose Lustre frights Thee thus. And how Wilt Thou indure my Hand, who now Confounded art with one poore beam Which from my Countenance doth stream? And yet more powerfull, &amp; more bright And farr more sweet then is this Light, Is My dear Name: I JESUS AM Whom Thou to persecute art come. Sure Heavn &amp; all its powers doe lie In this blessd words Epitomie. Sweetly rolld up: Sure JESUS is The truer Name of Paradise. In this one Sound all Charmes unite Their Mystik &amp; unconquer'd might: Which makes all Nature stop, &amp; yeild Unto victorious Grace y? Feild. Rage never held a larger part In any robbed Lyons Heart, Then in Sauls furious Soule, untill This potent Name his Eares did fill: His eares, w?? stop'd before had heard Onely y? Outside of y? Word. But now no Dove more mild, no Lamb More gentle ever was &amp; tame, No Aire more calme, no wax more free To entertain impression: See How patiently He lies; DEARE LORD, Vers. 6. WHAT WOULDST THOU HAVE ME DOE's his word. I am beseig'd with light &amp; love And yeild my selfe to them: O prove Thy Prisoners Loyaltie; impose What task Thou wilt, I cannot choose But serve so dear a Conqueror: say Shall I goe travell in y? way, That hard &amp; stony way, which thy Most Faithfull Steven went in to die? Or shall I march unto y? Place Of thy dear Crosse, &amp; have y? grace To climb up to it, &amp; there pay The debt of this most gracious Day, My Blood &amp; Life? O that I had Ten thousand Hearts, that I might shed Some worthy store of Streames for Thee Who shed'st such Noble Blood for Mee! Stay, Zealous Soule; brave is y? heat Which in thy faithfull Breast doth beat. A Heat too brave to make such hast Unto its ashes; it must last Untill it flame so high &amp; bright, That all y? World admire its light: Untill it doth those Mists dispell Which on y? Earth have spred out Hell; Untill it dazell y? weak eye Of y? proud Priest, no longer high; Untill it takes up all y? room From Solyma to Illyrium; Untill its Prosperous beams doe fight With sturdy Romes most monstrous Night; And in great Nero's Court prepare Some lodging for Heavns Emperor. Then shall thy Fire have leave to make Towards its Sphear: A Sword shall take Away thine Head, or rather be But as a Snuffer unto Thee; For then y? Flame shall purer rise And reach far far above y? skies, Meeting y? fount of that Sweet Light, From whence it selfe at first grew bright; And so for ever glitter there A sweet &amp; intellectuall Star. Christmasse Day Wonders Birthday Which maks't Decembers face Fairer then May, And bidst y? Spring give place To fresher Winter, in whose hardie Snow A Flowre more sweet then y? wholl Spring doth grow. For Winter now A Virgin Plant espies Which all his snow Could never equalize: More white, more chast is shee, yet fertile too: The King of Miracles would have it so. For Hee it was Who would be borne below And find a place Amongst poor Us to grow: Him selfe He planted in our Dust, that Hee Might be as true a Mortall Thing as wee. That He should get A Birth all clean &amp; pure, Him selfe He set, And by that Art was sure. Proud flesh corrupts &amp; staine's y? Seed we sow: He, planted by his Spirit will spotlesse grow. Virginitie His Father vaunteth not Though glorious He So great a Son hath got. Wherfore Heavn orders that a Virgin be The Lilly-Mother of his Puritie. Upon y? white Church-wall oftimes have I Observ'd y? Light, Which darting from y? Skie Peirce'd y? unbroken Glasse, &amp; w?? it brought The orient colours in y? Window wrought. So from his sphear The Lord of Light doth come, And passing here His chrystall Mothers womb, Leaves her intirely whole, yet brings away Her perfect Image, borne as Man to Day He who did wear Gods radiant boundlesse Forme Shrinks Himselfe heer Into a simple worme. Heavn's moulded up in Earth, Eternity Grasp'd in a span of Time doth bounded ly. All Paradise Collected in one Bud Doth sweetly rise From its fair Virgin bed: Omnipotence an Infants shape puts on: Immensitie becomes a Little One. But onely Love Would not thus scanted be But stoutly strove 'Gainst this Conspiracie Of strange Epitomies, &amp; did display It selfe more full on this contracting Day. S. Stephen Blind foolish Jews, y? Stones yee throw Though rude as you, shall pretious grow, And sparkle in y? Martyrs Crowne, Whom yee exalt by beating downe, Or serve to pave his way On's Coronation Day. As y? Arabian Sweets are bruis'd To make them sweeter; so y'have use'd Our pretious patient Saint: see now What store of Odours from Him flow, Which in a cloud arise Perfuming all y? skies. What odoriferous Prayers from His beaten bruised Mouth doe come! How like an Incense Offring they To Gods owne Nostrills make their Way, Striving to pacifie The angry Dietie! For You He prayes, &amp; louder beats Heavns Gate, then all your bloody threats And stones doe Him. But having sed His Prayers, he falls asleep; his Bed Indeed is hard, yet this The Bed of Honour is. And Honour sweeten's every bed, And gently doth repose y? Head Of Noble Hero's: Tis not all Your rampant cursing noise that shall Keep Steven from Sleeping on His hardy Bed of Stone. There sleeps his reverend Body. But His soaring Spirit to Heavn is got; Nor wears He onely in his Name A Crowne, but on his Head doth flame Felicities pure gemme, An Heavnly Diademe. He crowned is, &amp; is with all The Crowne of that stout Troop, w?? shall Upon their Heads wear ruby beames And grained Purple Diadems The crowne of those who give Their lives away to live. Receive my Spirit Lord Jesu cry'd The Noble Saint, &amp; so he dy'd. O no, He then began to live A Life, w?? Life could never give. Death is y? Art wherby Martyrs leave off to dy. He gan to live, &amp; gan to prove His Sacred Ministry above. The Deacon gan to wait upon The Soveraigne Priests triumphant Throne; And by that Service, He Began a King to be: Jesus is King of Kings, &amp; his Kingdome by Saints impeopled is, Who from his Crowne's reflected beams Doe all receive their Diadems; So they all reigne in blisse, Yet He sole Soveraigne is. S. John The Disciple, whom Jesus loved Belov'd indeed: not that thine onely Heart Had captiv'd His, &amp; did monopolize All its rich wares of Love, w?? did impart Themselves in liberall fulnes, &amp; surprise The Universe w?? Sweetnes; but y? Hee Who loved all Men was IN LOVE WITH THEE. He was in love with thy Virginitie, Which with all blooming beauties was bedeckt: Millions of softest Graces shin'd in Thee, Which from Heavns Treasuries He did select To garnish out a worthy Spouse, in whose Delicious eyes, his owne He meant to lose. He was in love with y? Reflection Of His owne Sweetnes shining in thy Face; With Sympathetik Joy He dwelt upon His iterated Selfe in that pure Glasse, Striveing all amorous Arts on it to prove; O blessed Soule w?? whom Love fell in Love. From off y? troubled Maine He lured Thee Into a deeper Sea of calmest Pleasures, The Bosome of Supreme Serenitie To which y? Ocean is but poore in Treasures: His owne dear Breast to Thee He opened wide, And let Thee in unto its fullest Tide. There didst Thou lie next to y? Heart of Love, Whose ravishing imbraces kept Thee warme With all y? best of Heavn, no more above, But folded up in His incircling Arme: Whence our admiring Thoughts, Great Saint, conclude, Thou wert aforehand with Beatitude. The lofties Stories, where pure Seraphs dwell Exalted in felicities bright Sphear, Thy dainty Habitation doth excell; For at His Footstoole They lie prostrate there Amidst y? Sweets of whose all-balmy Breast Thine onely Head makes its Delicious Nest. What potent Joyes, what mysticall Delight, Woo'd &amp; beseig'd thy Soule on every side, Whilst thy inamour'd Spouse spent all y? might Of Heavnly tendernes on his deare Bride! How many healing wounds gave His Loves Dart, How many living Deaths to thy soft Heart. Thus while He lived, He sweetly live'd in Thee: But now He dyes: Behold Him nayled fast Unto His Death. Yet no Mortalitie Can seize upon His Love; observe his last And tenderest words, whilst He Himselfe doth dy, To Thee He gives Loves living Legacie. Into His Dearest Mothers Bosome Hee Commendeth Thee, &amp; bids Her owne her Son! What Nature could not, Love commands to be, And Mary must be Mother unto John. Jesus &amp; John love had so closely tyde, That in their Mother They must not divide. Mary no other Glasse could find, where Shee So fair an Image of her Son might read; Nor John so pure a Mirrour, wherin Hee His ever-looking-longing eyes might feed On His dear Lord. Thus Love, though dead &amp; gone, Sweetly leaves John his Spouse, Mary her Son. No wonder, dearest Saint, y? on Thy Toung Love builds his Hive, &amp; drops his Honey thence, Whilst thy Soule-charming Words relish so strong Of Heavns best Sweets, &amp; choicest influence: That Love, from his owne Wing lent Thee y? quill Which all thy Lines w?? Charity doth fill. No wonder y? Port Latin saw y? Oile Scalding in vaine: Thou, who dost live by Fire, And in whose Breast such amorous streams doe boile, Canst feele no other Flames. O, no: some higher Fervor of Love must melt thine owne, &amp; send Thee to y? flaming Bosome of thy Friend. The languishments of never-faint Desire Must crowne thy Life with correspondent Death: Though by sharp pains thy Brethren doe expire, This dainty Martyrdome must end y? Breath Of y? BELOVE'D DISCIPLE; onely by Those Flames the Phenix lived, must it dy. Wednesday in y? Holy Week Who doubts how Avarice can be Plaine &amp; right-downe Idolatrie, Neither thy Story, Judas, knows nor Thee. He knows not how a little poore Silver mov'd thy Devotion more Then He, whom Men &amp; Angells all adore. JESUS the Crowne of Heavn &amp; Earth, From whom all Glory takes its birth, To thy Idolatrous Heart seems little worth: Worth lesse then is y? meanest Wight; For Moses sure hath settled right The price of Man in his Creators sight. God never priz'd a Man so low As thirty silver Peeces, though He were as wretched &amp; as vile as Thou. And yet canst Thou thy God &amp; Lord At a farr lower price afford Then He has valued Thee at in his Word. And Chapmen Thou canst easily find Resolv'd to traffique to thy minde With ready money, &amp; are all combinde, Combinde to gaine this Prize; since they Gods House to Trading did betray, Him too among y? Wares account they may. Unhappy Wretch, Thou dost to day Not thy own God alone betray, But thy despairing Selfe Thou sell'st away. For JESUS still though sold so cheap, Is worth a World: all his poor Sheep Shall still from Him a full Redemption reap. Thursday in Holy Week Griefe stay a while, to morrow Wee Will wait on Thee. Now holy Joy must take it part And cheare y? Heart. Not all Hells furie can say nay, For This is LOVES great Holyday. And LOVE to day most nobly feasts His faithfull Guests Great is y? Cheer, as great as He Could make it be: If y? choise Dainties of all Heavn Is this high Entertainment given. For on y? royall Bord is set Illustrious Meat Whose noble composition is Of Life &amp; Bliss. Meat, in whose pretious Mixture lies Such Sweets, as Shame old Paradise. Nor is't a drie Feast, here is wine Purely Divine, Blood of y? heavnly Grape, which God Heer planted had: A Cordiall Wine, which onely can Truly cheere up y? Heart of Man. For in y? crowned Bowle doth move The Blood of Love. LOVE his own dear Heart-Blood doth spill The Cup to fill With streams as rich &amp; sweet as they, Which all about Gods right hand play. All Heavn is melted, &amp; doth drop Into y? Cup: Which smiling there, invites each Guest To come &amp; taste, Come taste, sayes LOVE, &amp; drink in MEE At one short draught Eternitie. Sit downe, Dear Friends, &amp; feast, sit downe; All is your owne: I came to dresse this cheer below Onely for You: No Angell shall intrude: this Fare I did for humble Men prepare. And must y? worst of Wormes, Vile Wee Feast upon Thee Immortall LOVE? Must all y? Cheer Thou makest heer Be spent on Wretched Beggars? Must That pretious Cup be spilt on Dust? Sure Thou art LOVE indeed, pure LOVE Which dost not move By Reasons rigid rules, but by The Fervencie Of its owne Fullnes. Royall LOVE Will make it selfe its Reason prove. Goodfryday (To a Base &amp; 2 Trebles.) Weep &amp; spare not: Good eyes are not Of use, now He is gone On whose sweet eyes alone They dwelt, &amp; liv'd, &amp; lov'd, &amp; read More Heavn then in y? Sphears is spread. We tender not our dull eyes now Wee finde The Eye of Heavn it selfe to Day is Blinde. Poore Eyes, what have you left to see But blackest face of Miserie? Then though you melt &amp; waste With your owne Tears at last; Yet We care not; Weep &amp; spare not. Easter (To a Base &amp; 2 Trebles.) Tears have done: Our Rising Sun Shall drie you up, &amp; bring His ever-smileing Spring Of purest Joyes, which blest at first Old Paradise, where they were nurst. What though that Night were long? This gilded Day Wears on his Forehead an eternall Ray. Now JESUS lives, We cannot die Or but to live immortally. In Him w' are rose again Before Death us hath slain. Then sing we on, Tears have done. Chorus Rise Heart; Thy Lord was early up, arise And sing Him now his Morning-Sacrifice. Saturday in y? Holy Week The Sabbath now Can a more ample Title show Unto its Rest since God againe Doth now refraine And cease his Work, a Work much more Laborious then He rested from before. The Frame &amp; fashion Of this huge bulk, y? whole Creation Cost Him no more pains but y? speaking For its whole making: But now its dear Redemption stood Him in his Groanes, his Sweat, his utmost Blood. His weary Head Rests now at quiet in a Bed Fast sealed up &amp; fortify'd Strongly beside. With a well Armed watch, that none May stir Him till He wake, &amp; rise alone. For Potent He Will teach subdued Death to be Onely a safe &amp; sweet Repose Unto all Those, Who falling into their last sleep Commit themselves into his Hands to keep. O happy Grave! Ne'r could y? Beds of Princes have Such royall honour as We see Layd up in Thee: Not Solomons Couch, though Arabie did With all its Sweetest Beds go there to bed. Our Tombs from Thee Shall learne delicious to bee, Safe Cabinets, wherin We may With comfort lay Our weary bones, &amp; rest in hope Till y? Worlds generall Crack shall set them ope. Newyear Day (To a Base &amp; 2 Trebles.) Faind Janus now forget thy Name, And both thy faces hide for shame, The Nobler Face of Heavn &amp; Earth Are joynd in this Great Infants Birth, Who in His double Nature now is come To ope y? Year at Bethlehem, not at Rome. Shine out blest Year; 'twas not to cause A Blush, that Blood drop'd on Thy Face, Those Circumcision Drops will dresse Thee in bright Purple Blessednesse. The Paschall Lamb doth sprinkle his most pure Blood on Times Doore to keep it safe &amp; sure. Sweet Earnest of an happy Year, Which on thy Front all Heavn dost wear Shine out Faire Day, y? we may see That fairer Sunne, which smiles in Thee. Shine out, that Heavn &amp; Earth may have y? Grace To read y? Name thats printed on thy Face. O downe with Heart, &amp; downe w?? knee Tis Hee that made both, whom we see: Behold how Hell, Earth, Heavn &amp; all Downe flat to Him in reverence fall. The radiant Forehead of this noble Day The Glorious Name of JESUS doth display. Jan. I. 1643 Away fond Hopes, built upon THREE MONTHS HENCE And on y? drienes of y? spring: Mischeifs post faster on Then aged Time can run, And in their Traine a FALL they bring, 'Gainst which y? tender SPRING knows no defense. What if kind Heavns should make next SPRING as dry As are our stony Hearts or eyes? The BLOOD already sown Is not so deep sunk down But it before THREE MONTHS may rise And reach our foolish Hopes that mount so high. But sure our Sins are higher grown then so, No BLOOD of ours can wash away Those tall, &amp; mighty Things, Onely y? Stream which springs From thy dear veines, Sweet LORD can stay And staunch that Torrent, which so high doth flow. Thy potent BLOOD, though ne'r so little, may Performe y? Cure: Good frydays Even We need not wait to see: O let y? Medicine be That Earnest, which at first was given Those pretious DROPS Thou shedst for Us to Day. Our Hopes We rather build on this WET SPRING, Thy young Obedience may suffice For our old Sins, &amp; Wee With joy may live to see Our happiest PEACE from BLOOD arise, The Soveraigne BLOOD of our triumphant King. Purification of y? B. Virgin (To a Base, a Tenor, &amp; 2 Trebles.) How shall Chrystall purer grow? What shall purge, &amp; whiten Snow? In this Sacred Virgin-Mother Snow &amp; Chrystall joyne together. What shall Days faire gate adorne, What shall gild y? face of Morne? Ne'r did East so pure as Shee Beare a Sun of Majestie. Yet must Chrystall, yet must Snow, Yet must th' East to clensing goe: By no Law, but onely the Sweet Law of Humilitie. Purification of y? B. Virgin S. Luc 2. 24. May We have leave to ask, illustrious Mother, Why Thou dost Turtles bring For thy Sons Offring, And rather giv'st not one Lamb for another? It seems that golden showre w?? 'tother Day The forward Faithfull East Pour'd at thy Feet, made haste Through some devout expence to find its way. O pretious Poverty, which canst appeare Richer to holy eyes Then any golden prize, And sweeter art then Frankincense &amp; Myrrh! Come then, that Silver, which thy Turtles wear Upon their Wings, shall make Pretious thy gift, &amp; speak That Son of thine, like them, all pure &amp; fair. But know that Heavn will not be long in debt; No; the Eternal Dove Downe from his Nest above Shall come, &amp; on thy Sons dear Head shall sit. Heavn will not have Him ransom'd, heavns Law Numb. 18, 17. Makes no exception For Lambs, &amp; such a one Is He: A fairer Lamb Heavn never saw. He must be Offerd, nor must Thou repine: Heavn hath a Title too, As neer &amp; sure as Thou; And He is Gods Firstborne as well as Thine. He must be Offerd, or y? World is lost: The whole Worlds Ransome lies In this great Sacrifice; And He will pay its Debt, whate'r it cost. Nor shall these Turtles unrepayed be, These Turtles which to day Thy love for Him did pay: Thou ransom'dst Him, &amp; He will ransome Thee. A deare &amp; full Redemption will He give Thee &amp; y? World: this Son, And none but this alone By His owne Death can make his Mother live. S. Matthias There must be Twelve; y? other Sunn Thorough no fewer Signes doth runn; Then why should He, whose Zodiak is As heavnly full, &amp; faire as His; And whose sweet beams doe further flie Then Phebus ever could descrie, Darting out Light On those, whom Night And Shades of Death till now had buried quite Judas, that ominous Signe, is now Falln from his Orbe, &amp; finds below A fitter Region, his owne Home, Where Traytors all have fitting room, But still below his Throne, who there Reignes King of Treason. In his Sphear A Vacancie Long may not be, Plenty of stars are ready heere, you see. But two of Noblest Magnitude The great Election soon conclude; Joseph y? Just is one, the other Is good Matthias, Joseph's brother In every beam of Virtue, so, That which was fairer of y? two Is far above Mans Art to prove Heavn onely knows which way y? scale will move. Wherfore to Heavn they doe referre To judge which was y? worthier. The Lots are cast; And Heavn, whose Eye Into all Hearts &amp; Reigns doth prie, Did guide y? doubtfull prize to goe On brave Matthias side, &amp; show How he had more Of Virtues store Then He, who in his Sirname JUSTICE wore. Illustrious Saint, We bid Thee joy Of thy Preferment: Now thy way Lies fair &amp; plaine unto a Throne Of endlesse triumph, built upon Glories immortall Pillars, where Thou one day shall inthron'd appeare, And from that great And potent Seat Judge the proud Tribes then trembling at thy feet. Ashwednesday Right Welcome pleasant bitter Day: Smiles never did so sweetly play Upon y? sleek And shining cheek Of Joy, as now On thy sterne brow Severer Frowns, in whose black furrows lie Deep sowne y? Seeds of true Festivitie. O how much sweeter is y? Pill Which honest Bitternes doth fill With healing Powers, Then all y? Flowers And Creame, y? we And Luxurie Suck from abundant Diet's treacherous Breasts, Whose Office, sweetly is to choke Her Guests. Let Sugars tempting baits be spread On things, which flatteries help doe need: No need hast Thou Such charmes to throw Upon thy face, Whose potent grace Though spread with palest ashes, yet can move The Noblest Spirits with Thee to fall in love. For in those Ashes sure there lie Sparks of that Fire, w?? cannot die: Embers of Love Which nobly prove Their Royall Race When in y? Face Of Heavn they flie, &amp; with full fervour rise In flaming Pietie to their native skies. Envy no other Crowned Day Who art a purer Feast then they: None of thy Sweets Consist in Meats, And things where Beasts May be y? Guests: Angelick is thy Entertainement since Thou art the Festival of ABSTINENCE. A Feast w?? doth invite each Guest Not to devoure, but to Regest To clense y? Heart And every Part Where Luxurie Had made a Stie: A Feast, where they most welcome are, &amp; most Merry, who of y? deepest sadnesse tast. A Feast, which knows no other wine But what is Princely, &amp; Divine, Which grows not in Canarie's sun Nor Grecian Hills; A Wine, which fills Gods Sacred Bottles &amp; doth onely rise From y? fair Fountaines of repentent Eyes. A Feast, where we may feed &amp; be Fatned up for Eternitie: And learne below How We may grow Fit for that Upper All-glorious Supper, Which Gods Magnificent Lamb doth there prepare For those, that Feast themselves with fasting here. A Feast, whose Musik doth rebound A welcome &amp; delicious Sound Unto His Eares Who tunes y? Sphears. A Feast where Groanes And dolorous Tones Wait on each draught of Teares, whose variation Makes y? grave Musik of Mortification. Sit downe, Dear Friends, loe a soft Bed Of Ashes here is ready spread. Sit downe &amp; feast Your fill: at least Sit downe to cross Our ancient Losse; Feed here, &amp; countermine y? envious Devill, Being as Gods discerning Good &amp; Evill. Annunciatio B.V. Come every Eare That longs to heare News though most strange, yet full as true As ever rung From any Toung, Or from Fames widest Trumpet flew. Observe you there A Messenger Faire as y? Morne, whose noble Wing All pure &amp; bright As is y? Light Some News as sweet as Day doth bring. And tis y? Day The World did pray So long to see; The World which sate In a dark Night Till now this Light Begins its dawne from Heavns fair Gate. It is no lesse Then Blessednesse Which Gabriel brings; it is y? News Of God who now To us below Himselfe, &amp; all his Bounty shews. The Mighty One Gods onely Son Sets forth to Day, &amp; Gabriel's come His Harbenger To find Him heer A Correspondent Royall Roome. And that can be No where, sayes He But in thy revernd womb, sweet Maid; Where this great Guest Will take his rest And in that private Bed be layd. Haile, Queen of Love, Whose Sweets can move The Spouse of Hearts to lodge with Thee, And hither come From his bright Home To shrowd in thy Virginitie. Inlarge thy Breast To make a Nest For the Eternall Dove, who now From Heavn will hover With thy dear Lover, To place Him in his House below. O doe not fear To lose thy Dear Virginitie, who art design'd Above all other, In whom a Mother Shall with a Virgin be conjoynd. Be but content And give consent To be y? Mother of thy God That we may see Againe in Thee The budding of old Aarons rod; And by thy Seed Forever tread With noble Vengeance on y? Head Whose craft at first Made all accurst, Who from y? Woman issued. HAILE FULL OF GRACE; May we have place To heap our prayses on thy Crowne, About whose wreathe All Sweets doe breathe And Heavns illustrious Joyes are throwne. May we have leave To think old Eve No more unhappy, who have found The Cure, &amp; may With Triumph say: EVE'S GALL in MARIES SWEETS are drownd. Good Fryday But now y? Sceen is chang'd, chang'd is y? Day, Chang'd from it selfe, &amp; clad in strange array Black as y? News it brings: A monstrous Night Usurps th' amazed houres of banish'd Light, Bidding y? Sun his revernd Eyes forbeare And snatch all Heavn from our curs'd Hemispheare. The World would not its God indure to see, And why should Heavn to it unveiled be? Let Night take Vengeance on that treacherous Noon Which strives t' extinguish Heavns Eternall Sun. Yet shall no cloud of Night or Shame forbid Our eyes attendance: JESUS is not hid To those, who know &amp; love Him, &amp; can spie Ev'n on his Crosse his true Divinitie. A glimpse wherof y? Thiefe with greedy Eyes No sooner stole, but straitway He descries This most abused &amp; despised Thing To be a most sublime &amp; potent King. And so had need to be, now Hell &amp; Earth Are with confederate malice marched forth, And well appointed come into y? fight With all y? furniture of warlike spight, With swords, w?? staves, w?? whips, w?? spears, w?? thorns, W?? threats, revilings, Blasphemies &amp; Scornes, Engins prepar'd on purpose to prevaile Upon his Body, &amp; his Soule assaile; Engins enough against a Mortall Foe: And might have conquerd Him, had He been so. But He is their Almighty Friend, whose love The whole Worlds armed Hate cannot remove. He fights as well as They, &amp; with more force; Yet against Them bends not its potent course, Nor thinks it can His Mighty Arme commend With peevish Dust &amp; Ashes to contend. With Heavn He grapples, &amp; by Valiant cries Full in y? face of Gods great Justice flies. Striving to stifle Vengeance, w?? was now Upon its March to tame y? World below. O Noble Combat! Men incounter Him, He wrestles with his God to rescue them. Father, by all th' inchanting Powers w?? lie Treasur'd up in that Sweet Names Epitomie, Regard y? Prayers of thy Dying Son Who Dyes for what He prayes: Let me alone Spend all thy Quiver, that no Arrow may Be left, these poor unwitting Men to slay. Hell has deceiv'd them; tis not They, but Hell That kicks at Heavn. O let this Blood they spill Wash their Mistake away, &amp; wooe their eyes To answer these my Wounds: O let my Cries And sighs rebound from thine appeased Eare Upon their Hearts, &amp; raise a Tempest there Of penitentiall sorrow; so shall I See them begin to live for whom I die. O blessed JESU, how wilt thou repay Those, who shall love Thee, &amp; thy will obey If such delicious vengeance Thou dost take On them, who both thy Laws, &amp; Body break, Who broach thy veins, &amp; make Thee look as red With blood, as they with Crimes are coloured; Who having nayld Thee to thy Torments, crie, Come downe, &amp; save thy Selfe from Miserie. O no, Thou wilt not come; tis not thine owne Deare Life, which can perswade Thee to come downe. Tis not thy selfe, but them y? mock at Thee And at their owne prepar'd felicitie Whom Thou desir'st to save: y? more their spight Heightens their Crime, y? more thy Love doth fight By mediating for them: thy desire Is not to live longer then to acquire Their Pardon, who are busily imployd In murdering Thee, &amp; their owne Soules beside. Now therfore hang'st Thou as a Mark, wherat All Tortures, Pains, &amp; Pangs are to be shot. For these Thou woo'st, &amp; these are easily won No Anguish but it seeks Thee out, not one Inhumane shamelesse Torment, but can find Some way to sting thy Body or thy Mind. Judas his monstrous Fact, y? High Priests Sin, The Peoples obstinate faults come flocking in, Adams &amp; Eve's Rebellion, every Crime Which hath been hatched since y? birth of Time Or which y? ending Worlds last minute shall Be witnes to in one Black Tempest fall Upon thy single Head: y? mighty Lord Of y? Worlds Massy Pillars never stood So heavy on y? Center, as on thy Unpittied Heart this long Conspiracie Of raging rampant Sorrow. Yet is this Farre from y? Masterpiece of thy distresse. Some comfort would it be if Heavn would now A gentle &amp; propitious aspect show. But no kind beam peeps from y? lowring skie To light so much as Hope: y? Fathers Eye Is shut against y? Son; oh bitter News! O who can help, if God to help refuse! Well may thy desolate State, Sweet JESU, now Unto thy Patience some complaint allow: Well may thy wondring Greife thus Question make, O God, my God, why dost Thou Mee forsake! And we will wonder too, why Rocks &amp; Stones Deferre their Splitting, now such mighty Groanes Rend all y? Heavns; &amp; why y? Graves forbeare To ope, &amp; let thy trusty Friends appear And rise in time, if not to rescue Thee Yet to lend Pitty to thy Miserie. Surely such Griefe as thine was never heard: The whole world passeth by w??out regard, Leaving its Pains to Thee; &amp; Thou alone Who need'st it most, find'st least Compassion; Thou find'st not that, which Thou to all dost lend, All are thy Foes, whilst Thou to all a Friend. O King of Patience, may thy Copie be Incouragement unto our Constancie. Afflictions now are pretious Things, since they Crown'd thy sweet Head, &amp; in thy Bosome lay. May Enemies be too weak to force us to Hate them againe, whom thou hast loved so. (Thy Noble love to them has made them prove Well-worthy Objects of our poorer love.) So shall we welcome scornes, &amp; hug Disgraces; So shall our Armes well practiz'd in imbraces Professe y? best of Fencing which is by All-patient Love to conquer Tyrannie. So shall our whips &amp; Thorns forget to Us That ever they were steep'd in Bitternes; And these y? Arrows, those shall be y? Cords Which Divine Love to faithfull Hearts Affords. So shall thy Noble Crosse to our esteeme The Throne of Victory &amp; Triumph seeme. It was of old y? Cursed Tree, but Thou By Death y? Tree of Life hast made it now: A Tree forever verdant, w?? doth spread Its shade as far as Heavn its light doth shed. With humble kisses, &amp; with Tears of joy May We acquaint with it, &amp; let no Day Pass w??out thanks to our delicious King, Who turnes y? Crosse into so Sweet a Thing. Easter Slow Phoebus thou hast slept too long; Our earlyer song Long since awake attended on A Fairer Sun: A Sun, whose Rise Summond our Eyes Betimes to pay their Morning Sacrifice. Thou quite hast lost this noble Day: A richer Ray Prevented thine, &amp; gilds y? skie With Majestie Great Jesus light Hath broke from Night And sweetly woo's the Worlds admiring Sight. As from her Morning balmy Nest All over drest With new borne beauties Thou hast seene The radiant Queen Of Birds appeare; So riseth here A more then Phoenix in our Hemispheare. His Native Tombe was sweetned more With odorous store Of Libanus and Arabie: Or rather they Perfumed were By kissing here The feet of Him, in whom all Odours are. Nor could y? Phaenix ever gaine So far a Traine Of wing'd Attendants; Paradise Now hither flies Upon y? Wings Of these Sweet Things In whose eternall Song Gods Glorie rings. For Angells shining all in white Answer y? Light Of this fair Day; &amp; wait upon The reverend stone Which was y? Bed Where He lay dead And where He springs afresh inlivened. Yet may We Night-birds too have leave To Day to heave Our swarthy Wings, &amp; joine with Them To wait on Him, And His fair East, Which knows no West Wherby its glorious Day might be supprest. Especially seing His Great Rise All ours implies, And draws them after it, all We Aforehand be With Death &amp; are Past its cold feare Now he, our Head revived doth appeare. S. Mark Tis not thine Alexandrian Seat, Though faire &amp; great That can conteine y? fame Of Thy illustrious Name, Nor may Venitian Triumphs satisfie The debt y? world ows thy dear Memorie. The furthest Isles, Great Saint must pay Their part to Day: The Sunns all-piercing Eye No climate can descrie Remov'd beyond ingagement unto Thee, For Light much fairer then from Him they see. Our England all innobled by The Historie Of Blisse &amp; Heavnly Light, Which thy faire Pen did write, Must eccho back with English Pens &amp; Toungs The bounden dutie of her thankfull Songs. For surely from a Cherubs wing, Or some such thing, Thou pluck'st that Noble Quill Which writeth Heavn as well And true as Cherubs sing it, which displaies That very JESUS, whom their Anthems praise. Faire it displaies Him; We who were Muffled up here In mists of Death &amp; in The gloomy shades of sin, Have seen his Sweet and all-refreshing East Set ope a Wondrous Day in this our West. We read thy Book, &amp; reading kisse Those leaves of Blisse And unto Him appeale; Whom they to Us reveale To help our Thanks: onely that King of glory Whom Thou recordest, can reward thy Story. May-Day SS. Philip &amp; James. To Crowne y? Smileing front of May And double gild its eldest Day, Philip &amp; James Two radiant Names, Both full &amp; faire Here stamped are, Whose interwov'n fraternall Rayes Make of this one two Holy-Dayes. Two Holy Dayes to Sacred Mirth, Mirth, w?? doth cheer both Heavn &amp; Earth. Heavn gains a Pair Of Stars more faire, Then those whose light Spangles y? Night, And Earth though loosing them, does yet Triumph that they in Heavn are set. We count not that they dy'd to day Who now begun to live for aye. The Day w?? paints The Death of Saints With purple look In y? years book Arrayeth them for Life, &amp; is Onely y? Birthday of their Bliss. For Saints, while they are living here But all y? while a dying are: That gasp w?? we Fooles think to be Their dying breath Breath's out their Death; It breathes it out, &amp; sets them free From all Laws of Mortalitie. Great James &amp; Philip now are borne Twinns of one everlasting Morne, Where happy They Shall meet a May More Sweet then this They ope to Us: A May whose blessed Smiles are seen In Paradise for ever greene. S. Philip Twelve golden Trumpets to proclaime The fairer &amp; y? richer Name Of JESUS, by Himselfe were chose, In whose great Blast his Gospell goes, And rowseth all y? World which lay Loud snorting in y? face of Day: That Day, whose Dawne at Bethlehem broke, And thence its East all-glorious took From a rare Virgin much more faire And roseall, then the Maiden Aire, Which wanton fictions finely framed, And delicate Aurora nam'd. One of these royall Trumps was He Whose eccho this Festivitie Yields back in praise: In vaine y? world Some Nations hath in corners hurld Almost beyond Humanitie, Where banish'd &amp; forgot they lie, Living nor they, nor We know how Fast Locked up in ice &amp; snow: Philip has fire enough to melt More Winter then yet ever dwelt About y? Pole, or friezed up Barbarian hearts; no cold can stop The most unconquerd fervencie Of his Apostolike Charitie. He hies him to y? North, y? place Stamp'd with Proverbiall disgrace; The Place, whence never Goodnes came, And therfore Goodnes now doth frame His journey thither: Philip there Finds out a Clime well worth his care; A Clime, where though y? boistrous Winds Breathe endlesse Frosts, whose rigor binds The captiv'd Sea &amp; Land, &amp; where December walks through all y? yeare; Yet are y? things y? should be Men More stupid &amp; congealed then Their frozen Country, &amp; will show Farr Lesse relenting in a Thaw; For Scythia's Clime in vaine contests In point of Cold with Scythian Breasts. These Breasts are they our Saint makes choice Wheron to trie his Flaming voice. Much Fire he spake, &amp; spake so strong That Conquests waited on his Toung. The ice of Paganisme he brake And there a generall Thaw did make, By which y? Penitent floods did rise In all y? Yielding Peoples eyes. The Heavnly heat of JESU'S LOVE In their inlightned hearts did move, Whose fertile warmth makes them grow high In fruits of Christian Pietie. Thus Scythia is flaming now Ev'n In y? midst of all its snow. Back turns y? Saint in holy haste Whose great imployment was to last As long's his life. In Asia now A likelyer soile he strives to sow His heavnly Fire: Hierapolis His new selected Garden is. But in this warmer Clime He finds A colder Scythia; fiercer Winds Oppose Him here, &amp; strive to blow Away y? Seed his Tongue doth sow. No, here are Men, whose stomacks can Never digest that God is Man; Or if He be they scorne to change Their ancient Jupiter for a strange And feeble God, whose Crosse &amp; Shame Blast all y? Credit of his Name. Nay come, say They, wee'l make of Thee As good &amp; great a Dietie: We have a Crosse, &amp; Nayles wherby To inthrone thy upstart Majestie; We have Contempt &amp; Taunts enough At thy despised Head to throw, And trie if thou by Patience can Approve thy selfe more then a Man. And welcome all, says Philip, I By these Proofs best shall testifie I am his Servant, &amp; dare give My life for Him, by whom I live. If you had let me ope y? way Unto your Blisse, you could not pay Me greater thanks then your blinde wrath Freely for Me devised hath. Goe then Undaunted Champion, goe, Since thine owne Heart will have it so. Drink deep, &amp; quench thy Noble Thirst In that brave Cup He drunk of first What now Thou followst: Take thy fill Of greatest Patience: &amp; spill That Blood which burnes so in thy veins Loud Challenging all wounds &amp; paines To let it out, that Thou mayst pay Thy Lord his Blood againe to Day As Thou art able: So shall Hee In his owne Colour seing Thee, Thy freedome give to Thee above In y? bright Citie of his Love. The Citie of Delight &amp; Blisse, The truer Hierapolis. Where we are sure Thou wilt not cease Strongly to interceed for these Unhappy Citizens, whose Hate Occasioned thy so happy State. S. James Bp. of Jerusalem All yee whose Pride is built upon Some generous relation To Noble Kindred, come &amp; see A Man whose Consanguinitie Intitles Him unto a Name Of far more illustrious Fame Then that big Traine of Words, wherby The Stiles of Princes swell so high: Come see a Man, who is no lesse Then Brother to y? Lord of Blisse. Yet his aspiring Soule is not Content with this alliance, but With brave ambition strives to be Neerer in Fraternitie Then Natures casuall hand had plac'd him, With royall Parents when it grac'd him. James will be Father to his owne Nobilitie, &amp; wear no Crowne But what he wins; by Virtue He Brother to y? Lord will be. Wherfore all his Noble paces With faithfull diligence he traces, Through every hard Heroik step Of Life &amp; Death he climbeth up; And let Jerusalem witnesse be Unto this great Veritie; Jerusalem, which having lost Its Sceptre, now againe may bost Of that reverend Throne, w?? there This glorious Bishop first did reare. A Throne, but not of pomp &amp; state; A Throne on which all Meeknes sate, A Throne of Love, a Throne wheron Reigned pure Devotion. Nor could lesse expected be From Him, whose Life was Pietie, Whose Meat &amp; Drink was to fullfill His dearest Masters royall will. Ne'r did y? dangerous Blood of grape Staine his most abstemious lip; Onely Virgin Fountains were Both his Cellars &amp; his Beere, Which pure &amp; coole did best agree With his unspotted Chastitie. Nor did y? rampant flesh of Beasts E'r reek in his grave simple Feasts; His highest, &amp; his daintiest Dishes Were some modest sober fishes, Meat very correspondent, where Onely water serv'd for beere. Delicious Oiles did never wet His Body with lacivious Sweat, No tender Bath's unmanly heat His hardy skin effeminate. O no; behold his reverend knee All plated with austeritie, No Camells rigid knee can show More patient Brawne then there doth grow: For on y? Temples Marble Floore So oft he kneel'd, that what before Was tender flesh, is now all one With y? Sacred Pavements Stone. Nay ev'n his forehead you may see Seal'd with y? same Severitie; Prostration in his Prayers had There y? like impression made, And mark'd him out for one, whose Zeale No wearinesse could ever feele. What wonder now, if He no more Can hide his worth as heretofore, Which all y? World that hath but eyes Ingraven in his face descries. Plaine they descry it, &amp; confesse, How much of Heavn it doth expresse: For on their knees all in his way The ravish'd People humbly pray But to kisse y? utmost hemme Of that robe, y? kisseth Him; That they may their lips therby, And their kisses sanctifie. Nay y? high &amp; sirly Priest Convinced is among y? rest, And his great Right imparts to him, Who a worthier Priest doth seeme; James may now have leave into The Sacred Oracle to goe, And injoy y? matchlesse glory Of that Noble Oratorie. But Winds &amp; Seas more trusty far, And constant then ye People are; And no Nations ever use Such shamelesse Treason as y? Jews. Jews admire &amp; love to day Him, whom to morrow they can slay; Jews can with the same lips kisse Thee, Which by &amp; by shall taunt &amp; hisse Thee. Jewish Mouths can speak all good Of Thee, &amp; forthwith suck thy Blood. 'Twas now their Passover, a Feast In which a Lambs blood was y? best That should be shed, but cursed They Humane veins will ope to Day JESU'S Name &amp; Doctrine still Perverse Jerusalem did fill With zealous Rage, w?? will not see How Maries Son the Christ can be. James therfore now must plainly show Whither He thinks Him so or no, And from y? Temples Battlement His full opinion represent. Fooles! &amp; what can James professe But truth of Him, who is no lesse Then Truth it Selfe? He knows full well How on this very Pinnacle His Master did that Foe subdue Who from Hells bottome thither flew. Him therefore He proclaimes aloud And his great Truths to all y? Crowd: JESUS IS GOD cries He, &amp; this Temple's his Fathers House, &amp; His. Jesus, whom on y? Crosse you nayld, Dy'd, but over Death prevaild, And laden with Hells spoiles is gone Home unto his heavnly Throne. At this th' impatient People crie Intolerable Blasphemie! Downe with him from that Holy Place Which he profanes: The Law doth passe His capitall Sentence; Throw him downe Lest We make his Crime our owne. Madnes was ready to fullfill The furious Peoples bloody Will; For those above feard not to throw The Martyr downe to them below. Indeed they thought they threw him downe, But helped him upward to his Crowne. Saints by such falls as these rebound To highest Heavns from lowest ground. Yet James by this not fully slaine Feeles their furious Spight againe: A Fullers club was soone at hand, And Rage as ready at Command; With this &amp; that at Him they flie, And in Him at Pietie. First their barbarous ears they stop, Then his reverend Head break ope, And their Monstrous selves they staine With his Blood, and with his Braine. The Passover did never know A Lamb so pure &amp; mild as Thou Great Saint but that whose eve did see, The Holy Lamb, w?? dy'd for Thee. He dy'd for Thee, &amp; Thou againe For Him, &amp; for His Truth art slaine; Slaine indeed, but slaine into A better Life then this below; A Life, which will exalt Thee higher Upon a fairer Temples Spire Then whence Thou fell'st, a Temple where In Truth is, what's in Shadows heere. Ascension (To a Base &amp; 2 Trebles.) Lift up your Heads great Gates, &amp; sing, Now Glory comes, &amp; Glories King; Now by your high all-golden way The fairer Heavn comes home to Day. Hark now y? Gates are ope, &amp; heare The tune of each triumphant sphear, Where every Angell as He sings Keeps time with his applauding Wings, And makes Heavns loftiest Roofe rebound The Treasures of this Noble sound Hallalujah: Which our poor Tongues shall as they may Restore to them againe &amp; say Hallelujah. Ascension The time is come For Times Great Lord to think of Home: A Home: but not to Him alone, Who goes to find a Mansion For Us, who be As well as he Pilgrims in this wild World of Miserie. He goes before To ope the everlasting doore: Come Cherubim, Resigne, saith He Your flaming Sword &amp; Custodie, That Adam may Againe to Day Find into Paradise his open way. For I must now Keep open House for all below, Who will accept my invitation, And come to this great Preparation: My Servants all Shall goe &amp; call All Tribes &amp; Nations to this Festivall. Sweet Cloud, whose back A Chariot soft &amp; cool did make For our Great Ascendant, wee This Privelege doe envy Thee. Were not y? Wings Of Angells, Things More fit to carry home the King of Kings? Yet seing He Is so well content with Thee, Wee, Things as sleight &amp; vaine as Thou, Will take Us pious Courage now; Our Hearts shall raise A Cloud of Praise Upon y? soft Wings of our sweetest Layes. Thus as We may Will We attend Him in His way; And as He goes our Song shall move In a tune as high as Love Can reach; as high As We can flie By stretching up our thankful Fervencie.(The Hymn Sett to 5 Parts for voices &amp; violls. by R. C.) Halalujah: Hark how y? joy full Heavns rebound The Triumph of this welcome sound: Halalujah. For they To Day Shall repossessed be Of what makes Heavn, Joyes Treasurie. Halalujah. Ne'r did Triumphant Conquerour wear Spoiles so rich &amp; vast as here: Halalujah: For see How Hee His Banner stained hath With y? Heart-blood of Hell &amp; Death. Halalujah: Great Lord of Life &amp; Death, too meane Is this our World to lodge Thee in: Halalujah: Thy Throne Alone Now full as big must be As all y? Heavns capacitie. Halalujah. Goe then &amp; may the Aire to Day Its sweetest Gales blow in thy way. Halalujah: And as They passe O let thy gracious Feet Print Blessings on y? Clouds they meet. Halalujah. Our long Adieu we take, but yet Not for ever take We it: Halalujah: Farewell Untill We meet againe, for We Doubt not thy bright Returne to see. Halalujah. High-mounted on a Cloud wilt Thou Returne as Thou ascendest now: Halalujah: Farewell, Yet still We must have leave to say, No Cloud shall beare Thee all away. Halalujah. Thy pretious Name &amp; Memorie Inhabitants with Us shall be: Halalujah. Our Layes Shall raise Their Noble Praises high, And their Ascension thus supply. Whitsunday (For a Base &amp; 2 Trebles.) But now Heavn comes againe y? Same It went, though in another Name It went y? Son, but here It comes y? Comforter. O blest &amp; strange, O sweet exchange! LOVE has made y? Bargaine even We did but part with Heavn for Heavn. Look how y? Stars come showring downe, Ambitious now to be y? Crowne Of Mortall Heads, where they Divided Flames display. Sweet Crowns, your shape Was not by hap: Right are the Churches Temples crown'd When cloven Mitres them surround. All Babells Tongues and more then they In these sweet Cloven Flames doe play: Which, though Divided, sure Will that Division cure. No feare but now Our Tower may grow High as its Hopes; y? Church may rise Compleat, &amp; meet y? equall skies. Whitsunday (To a Base &amp; 2 Trebles.) Fountaine of Sweets, Eternall Dove Which leav'st thy glorious Perch above, And hov'ring downe, vouchsafest thus To make thy Nest below with Us: Soft, as thy softest feathers, may We find thy Love to Us to Day; And in y? Shelter of thy Wing Obteine thy leave &amp; Grace to sing Halalujah. Whitsunday (To a Base &amp; 2 Trebles.) Thy heavnly Kingdome heere below Now like it selfe Dear Lord doth show, And needs no Metaphor to tell How Loftie Things beneath can dwell; Now thy Celestiall Flames are hither sent To light y? Stars of Earths new Fermament. How bright they shine! Brave Stars whose Light Spreads Day upon y? Face of Night! And gilds y? furthest Shades, which lie Hid from y? Upper Heavns great Eye. Coasts to y? glaring Sun unknowne shall say, Welcome Sweet beams of bright Religious Day. These Heavn's thy Glory shall declare, And with thy Prayses fill y? Aire, The Tongue of this Great Day shall send Thy Name unto y? Worlds vast end. Where e'r it lists this Spirit shall blow, &amp; find Its Chariot on y? Wings of every Wind. Whitsunday (To a Base &amp; 2 Trebles.) Tune We our Heart strings high, And to the Heavnly Dove As we are able, flie On Vocall Wings of Love. To Him our Thanks and Prayses pay In all the Tongues He gave to Day. Whitsunday 1644 What though the Fiends have chang'd their Place, Though Shamelesse Hell dare show its face So big &amp; black in our sad sphear And stare Upon the Sunne? though War Its bloody Mouth doth ope Threatning to swallow Hope Almost y? onely Relict that Is undevoured? Yet must we not Betray That little mighty stay Seing This is Comforts Holy-Day. When Truth went home, He left behind The Word, which now so true we find; The Comforter I'l send, sayd He; And we This Feast of Comfort see. To Day the Comforter Broke from his loftie Sphear And brought his sweet Omnipotence To conquer feares, &amp; chase them hence. And though Dangers still swarme below, They'r but to trie our Courage now. The Comforter will not deny Matter for Faith &amp; victorie: Nor could He be a Comforter If heere No Enemies did appeare. Tis our advantage now That Hee does Foes allow, Who allwayes ready is at hand To conquer what doe Us withstand. Doe Yee But dare to fight, says He, And if you faile complaine of Mee. How should We faile, Dear Lord, when thy Allmighty Hand does Strength supply? Had We but Faith in this Great Day, Dismay Would vanish quite away. O win our Soules, &amp; wear The Spoiles Thou come'st for heere: Help Us to fix our Trust in Thee, So shall our greatest Conflicts be An Art To exercise each part, But most of all to breathe our Heart. So shall this happy Exercise Be but a Trade of Victories; And whilst one hand does fight, y? other Shall gather Balmes for his conquering Brother: Which both of them shall bring To Thee their mighty King: And at thy Feet shall throw them downe, Being not theirs, but all thine owne. Poore Wee Can never Victors be Unlesse by thy Sole Potencie. Trinitie Sunday (For a Base &amp; 2 Trebles.) Fond Syllogismes, in vaine You arme your Propositions Three Against Religious Trinitie. Alas, what need you straine To run so mad with Reason, &amp; excell In wrangling all your Masters into Hell. Must Faith &amp; Heavn goe learne Reason of Arius? Must y? Son Be God no longer then Art can The Mysterie discerne, And by pure Demonstration teach y? Eye How th' Angles in the Eternall TRIGON lie? Fooles, we would not maintaine Our ONE in THREE, &amp; THREE in ONE, If your best Demonstration Could wisely it explaine. No: Tis a Mysterie, &amp; shall ever quell Both Arius, &amp; all other Gates of Hell. Come Faithfull Hearts &amp; sing: All Saints &amp; Angells will conspire To fix y? Consort of your Quire: They know your Mystik King: And in their everlasting Anthems crie (Chorus) Thrice HOLIE HOLIE HOLIE TRINITIE. Trinitie Sunday How well This dawns next that illustrious Feast, Which brought y? Heavnly Dove from his high Nest! The whole yeare did proclaime the Father's Name, Christmasse y? Sons, &amp; Pentecosts Sweet Flame The Sweeter Spirit: How 'twas time that We This TRIPLE ONE is one Dayes Unitie Should celebrate: time that our Triumphs now Full Catholik &amp; Orthodox should grow: Time that our Joyes be Mysticall &amp; high, Learning in one devout Loveknot to tie A Trinitie of Feasts. Hence faithlesse Yee Whither of Arius long-damned stock ye bee, Or of y? later but the ranker Weed, Which taints y? Churches Garden, goe &amp; feed On your drie Syllogismes, &amp; with your stout And witty impudence still face it out That they much sweeter &amp; more wholesome be Then Angells Bread the HOLY TRINITIE. Leave Us our Sweets, &amp; call them, if you will Fooles Paradise: We are contented still With Truth and Blisse on any termes; &amp; though We seem such easy credulous Fooles to you, JESUS to Us is wisdome made, Evn He Who is the wisdom of Eternitie. Nor shall those Serpents Hises, whose fell Toungs Lurk under yours, disturbe our faithfull Songs: That everlasting Mystik harmonie, Whose sweetnes dwelleth in y? TRINITIE, Invites our Musiks eccho; &amp; this Feast Of DIVINE CONSORT fits an Hymne y? best. HYMNE (To be sung w?? three voices.) 1 PART Ask not how the thing can be, But adore the Mysterie THREE IN ONE &amp; ONE IN THREE. Faiths Eye does not double see, But treble, yet in Unitie Seeing ONE it seeth THREE. The Sacred Knot's the Deitie Tied up close in Unitie Yet tied up in Persons THREE. 2D PT. O TRIPLE UNITIE We humbly offer Thee One Songs Triplicitie. As Thou art One may We All One together be, And One at length with Thee. So shall our harmonie By no time measured be, But by Eternitie. 3D PT. For when this brittle voice shall be Cracked by our Mortalitie, Our Hearts shall cleerer sing to Thee: When hence we are released to see The beams of thy Divinitie, We shall be cheerlyer being free. Then next thy Angells Harmonie Our Prayses shall resound to Thee Which We will tune by their high Key Halalujah. S. Philip y? Deacon June 6 Faith, thou art boundless; not one Graine Of Thee, but doth more weight conteine Then vastest Mountains: Yet full well Thou In Mens narrow Hearts canst dwell, Which Mystick Cells y? lesse they be And humbler, allways yeild to Thee. The larger roome: Thou lov'st to come To such as these with all thy Noble Traine, And fixing there thy potent Throne doth reigne. And Thus of old in Philips breast Thou kept'st thy Court; so great a Guest We never knew herselfe bestow Under a roofe more poor &amp; low. Yet with such glory didst Thou there On thy commanding Throne appeare, That thy strong hand None dares withstand But all Samaria doth acknowledge Thee Her best &amp; gentlest Conquerour to be. Sturdy Diseases, w?? could dare All Physiks Powers, modest are Before y? face of Philip, and Aw'd by his conquering Command; Rather then they with Men will fight Against themselves they'l turne their spight And by &amp; by Grow sick &amp; dy: And well y? Servant Sicknes may destroy, Whose Master lately Death itselfe did slay. But these were easy Cures: His Art Wrought cheifely on y? inmost Heart, By Teaching it a Life to live, W?? mortall Seed could never give: A Life w?? might y? First-fruits be And Dawne of Immortalitie. He rubs y? rust From off y? Dust, And fairely prints Heavn in its Head; for where JESUS is stamp'd y? sweetest Heavn is there. No Thunders Rage so dreadfull is To our most timorous ears as this All-conquering Name appears to those Who are Mans everlasting Foes: They exercise y? utmost skill That could be forg'd &amp; hatch'd in Hell To fortifie Themselves, &amp; trie Whither their Immortall Legions cannot be As strong as one poore Mortall Enemie. They trie indeed; but trie in vaine, Still Philip Victor doth remaine; And As y? mighty Tempest throws The Sea before 't where e'r it goes; So doth his Potent Voices Blast Foameing &amp; roaring Spirits cast Out from Mens breasts The Proper Nests Of a Mild Spirit: for there should onely dwell The Dove of Heavn, &amp; not these Ravens of Hell. Black Simon startled much to see The Forces foild, &amp; routed He Had sided with, swells w?? Disdaine, And falls to rave &amp; curse amaine: Now all yee Powers below, full well And justly are yee damnd to Hell, If yee whose Pride Did swell too wide For Heav'n, if yee, who feard not to oppose The great Eternall yeild to Mortall Foes. Blame not their God; the Place is due, And they succeed in right to you If they can beat you thus: Poor Fiends, Ev'n We your best &amp; surest Friends Sham'd by your weaknes, shall no more The Deitie of Hell adore; No more shall We Spit Blasphemie Against y? God of Heavn at your Devotion, If Earth can intercept Hells strongest Motion. Look how Samaria laughs at Me Conquered by Philips Potencie: Look how great Belzebubs dread Name Shrinks into Nothing at y? fame Of upstart JESUS, whilst we straine And play y? Devills all in vaine. No furie could Have stoutlier stood For your accursed Cause, then I have done, Nor earn'd a gallanter Damnation. And must I now be foold, must I Stoop unto any Deitie But thine great Lucifer; &amp; now In Spells &amp; charmes I aged grow Be thus out-conjur'd by a new And not hard Name? the words, w?? you Upon my Tongue Did print, were strong And dismall barbarous Sounds, but Philip by One sweet &amp; easy Name doth them defie. Me thinks had I thy Hornes &amp; Voice Dread Satan, by my Looks &amp; Noise I could affright y? Stars, &amp; throw The torne Heavns headlong downe below. Had I thy doubled-steeled Paws And thy long Adamantine Claws. Anew I'd tosse That Christ to's Crosse Where e'r he lurks, nor any Nailes would need To fix Him there, but what my fingers bred. For Shame renounce thy baffled Throne And let y? Airs Sweet Realme alone To Him y? rules in it; Goe dwell A Coward in y? holes of Hell: Thy conquerd Head &amp; Shame goe hide In thy old Night, where by thy side Deaths &amp; Despairs Thy Comforters Shall bid Thee welcome home, &amp; make thee be Content with that sole Principalitie. Search there y? black Records, &amp; send If thou canst find them, to thy Friend Some choice Receits, &amp; charmes, w?? yet Were never belched from thy Pit: Once more I'l trie for Hell &amp; Thee; But if I faile, farewell for Mee Devills &amp; Feinds, I'l get me Friends With Philip; blame not what you taught me, Pride; Though against Hell, I'l take y? nobler side. Thus vex'd, y? Wizard does his best Great Philips Power to resist; But finds him selfe too weak to fight With holy Faith's Mysterious Might, Which so amazeth him, y? he No longer dares its Enemie be: He yeilds, &amp; cries I sacrifice My black &amp; weak Profession to the Light, Which from y? Crosse doth break so strong &amp; bright. Victorious Saint, thus at thy Feet Convinc'd &amp; conquerd lies y? Great Champion of Darknes; Heare how He Beggs for his better Life of Thee. Grant Him his Prayer, &amp; drench Him in The Fountaine purgative of sin; The Fount, w?? will Quench all y? Hell That flam'd in Him; unlesse releas'd in vaine He throws Himselfe into y? Fire againe. S. Barnabas Acts 14 Tis not so poore a thing to be Servants to Heavn, Deare Lord, &amp; Thee As Earth would make it; no not heere In thy Humilities low Sphear; Not heer where scoffings &amp; Disgraces Use to be heaped on their faces, As on thy blessed Selfe they were When Thou didst breathe, &amp; grace our Aire. Through thine owne humble veile there broke Sometimes such Noble Beams as spoke The Sun within: Let Tabor be Witnesse to this faire Veritie. Thus didst Thou prove Thy Selfe; &amp; thus Assert'st thy Saints illustrious By Glimpses of that Glory Thou Aforehand dost on Them bestow. This royall Splendor faire did rise In all y? wondring Lystrians eyes, Whilst they beheld what Power there was Dwelling in Paul &amp; Barnabas: One, who since first he came into The world, in it could never goe On Natures errands, leapeth now, And feeles his feet obedient grow To Pauls command: No Lamenesse dares Be lame, where so great Power appeares. But, let what weakness will say nay, Forthwith finds legs to run away. Away that runs, &amp; in its roome The ravish'd People crowding come: Great Names of Gods (though Gods alas Lesse reall then those Names) did passe For current in their Pagan Creed: But now, say they, we have no need Of perblinde Faith, who cleerly see Naked &amp; plaine Divinitie Walking &amp; working heer; nor shall Those vocall masks, y? Names of Paul And Barnabas, snatch from our Eyes Our Two Omnipotent Deities: Paul is not Paul, but noble He Is y? most eloquent Mercurie; And Barnabas no lesse then Jove Father of all y? Gods above. For Gods they are though clothed in The Garb &amp; countenance of Men. Now comes y? Priest of Jove, &amp; brings His fattest finest Offerings, Selected Oxen, &amp; y? Pride Of every beauteous Garden, tye'd In dainty Garlands, so to please And welcome their grand Deities. And who shall heer forbid, says He, Great Jupiters High Priest to be True to his Office, &amp; to day Unto his God his homage pay? Why that will We, cry They, for whom This Pompe &amp; Sacrifice is come. Behold we rend our clothes, &amp; know Our Hearts are wounded more then so, To think that you should Us adore, Who are as brittle &amp; as poore Dust as your Selves; &amp; Him neglect, Whom We, you worship so, respect As onely God &amp; greater far Then your greatest Jupiter. A God that made both Him &amp; you, Both Things above, &amp; Things below, A God whose Clouds doe drop on Us A seasonable fruitfullness, And wet Joves rotten Grave, from whom You needs will dreame y? Raine doth come. Alas we were more Lame than He, Whom heer We heal'd to day could be Untill our God helped us; &amp; now That onely God we preach to you. And thus indeed our Saints did stay The Peoples Sin; but ope'd a way To greater glory: Noble odds They now have gaind on Pagan Gods, Who might have had, but did despise Ev'n Jupiters owne sacrifice. Thus To be JESUS Servants, speaks More royall Splendor far then breaks Forth from y? most Majestike Throne That Heathen God e'r sate upon. S. John Baptist I When Nights black houres be almost spent, And her still stealing course is bent To some far West, where Shee doth crowd Behind y? World herselfe to shrowd, The royall Day Doth not straitway In its full grace Supply y? place; But quick Aurora sweetly faire Stepps in before to trimme y? Aire, Showing ten thousand Roses all before The Suns bright entrance at his easterne doore. The Jews thick Night (where y? huge shade Of duskie Ceremonies made Jacobs great Sun descry'd from far Appeare no more than Jacobs Star) When once it grew Mature, &amp; drew Unto its end; Heavn strait did send An Harbenger to dresse the way With morning Glories for y? Day: The other darksome is to this Days Sun, Nor is Aurora faire compar'd with John. Elizabeth &amp; Zacharie Grown old in spotlesse Pietie Shall have their yeouth renew'd &amp; turne Againe unto their vigorous Morne, Whence shall be drawn This glorious Dawne: From such &amp; none But such, may John Derive his Birth; a Plant so faire Must needs of some choice Root be Heire; A Stream so pure &amp; holy could not be Issue to any Fount, but Sanctitie. Both in y? work &amp; in y? Place Of Holynes y? Business was Reveal'd at first, whilst Gabriel spies Old Zacharie at Sacrifice. He spies Him, and Doth silent stand Aside, y? He No stop might be Unto y? reverend Service: but Archangells faces cannot shut Their lustre up so easily; Zacharies eye Though old &amp; weak, its presence did descry. And as an awfull reverence did Through all his joints a trembling spread, Fair Gabriel with a gentle grace, Whilst all Heavn smiled in his face, Thus chears y? Saint; No time to faint Is this for Thee Blest Zacharie, But to grow young &amp; strong againe Strong as thy Noble Prayers, w?? streine And reach Heavns top with Clouds more sweet then those Which from that Incense Altar ever rose. Strong must Thou grow, &amp; strong shall be The Partner of thy Pietie: Thy Dear Eliza shall bring forth A dearer Son; in whose great Berth Heavn being far Ingag'd, takes care About his Name, Which wer't y? same With Thine, y? World might take Him for Old Zacharies Issue, &amp; no more: Heavn gives Thee Him, but bids Thee Name him John, For Heavns He is, &amp; not Thy Son alone. Be tender therefore how you fashion Heavns blessed Darlings education: No wine nor no strong Drink must gin To kindle dangerous fervour in His Sacred Blood: The Virgin Flood Of some chaste Spring Shall dayly bring Supply unto his Cup, that He As pure &amp; chaste as it may be: For in his infant venerable Breast The spotlesse Dove of Heavn will make its Nest. God means to come &amp; dwell w?? Men But will be nobly usherd in, And sends thy Son before to see His royall way prepared be. Hearts are y? path He chosen hath; And these alone By powerfull John Can conquerd be &amp; force'd to meet All plaine &amp; smoothe their Makers feet: For tis His Privelege fully to inherit Mighty Elia's most unconquerd Spirit. As strange as was y? Messenger Did this all-glorious News appear. Give leave, Illustrious Angell, cryes Good Zachary, if Doubts arise: Shall worthlesse I Grown old &amp; drie, Againe revive And double live, Fresh in my Selfe, &amp; in a Son So great, so pure, so strange a One? Surely this Wonder well deserves that Thou Some signe aforehand to my Faith allow. Know then, says He, I'm Gabriel, And that my honour is, to dwell Before y? Seat of God, &amp; see The glories of Divinitie. Those Spirits, w?? lie, Soar not so high, But groping dwell In lowest Hell Falshoods dark Kingdome: Truth alone Finds roome about the heavnly Throne. Yet take this Signe; thy Tongue w?? ask'd it, shall Be mute, till Men shall Thee Johns Father call. And with this Word, into y? Aire More pure then it, vanishd y? faire And nimble Spirit; whilst Zacharie Doth after in devotion flie; In praise his Heart Could beare her parte; But on his Toung Did sit so strong The Silent Signe, that onely now The language of his Pen can show His dear Eliza what had made him dumbe, And what would ope her aged barren wombe. II Eliza found the Promise true Which with her Wombe still bigger grew, And to its plenitude did swell Moneth after moneth; whilst Gabriel Being to goe On busines to A Friend of hers This News inferrs Among y? rest, which Shee w?? joy Imbraced, &amp; contriv'd a way How to goe visit, &amp; congratulate Her new revived Cosins pregnant state. No sooner was She come, &amp; had Her gentle Salutation made, But strait Eliza's wombe prevents Her Tongues most forward Complements. The Babe, w?? there Lay hid, did heare The Strangers Toung Which sweetly rung Heavn in his ears, &amp; made him know His mighty Lord was neer him now; He knows those gratious words can speak no other But Heavns and Earths Delight, his Makers Mother. Wherefore before Eliza's lips Could let an answer out, He skips With sprightfull joy, &amp; as He may Doth to his Lord his homage pay: Betimes He tries To exercise Himselfe, who was Designed to passe Before Him, &amp; all things prepare As his most faithfull Harbenger: He leaps, &amp; seems to chide y? Wombs delay Which stopt him now from entring on his way. At length y? happy time was come Which did release Him from y? wombe Unto his joyfull Mothers warme Kisses, &amp; soft imbracing Arme. Her Friends about Her round, poure out In thousand fashions Of Gratulations Their Joyes &amp; Wishes, every one Blessing y? Mother &amp; y? Son. But when y? Circumcision Morning came, A pretty quarrell rose about his Name. His Friends desir'd He might inherit Both his great Fathers Name &amp; Spirit, And in a kind presumption stilde Him Zachary. O no, y? Child Is mine, his Mother Cries, &amp; no other But John shall be His Name: to me Dear is the Name of Zachary, Dear as my reverend Lord, yet I Must have my will; this Name say I, or none; Let Him be Zachary's son, but named John. And must We this Sweet Babe, say They, Unto a forrein Name betray? A Name not heard of yet in thy Old Famous Line and Family. Meanst Thou to pluck Him from y? stock Where Heavn hath set him, And not let Him Be come a Root from whence may rise An endlesse Brood of Zacharies? O let his Father end this quarrell, and May his most reverend Decision stand. Content, &amp; what my Lord, says Shee, Does write shall prove a Law to Me. Grave Zachary no sooner takes The Table, but by it He speaks. His name is John. Which scarce was done, But strait He felt All y? Bands melt, Wherin Great Gabriel thus long Had kept close Prisoner his Toung. But now his Mouth flows with his Makers praise And vents his Spirit in inspired Layes. The sound of this restored Toung Through all y? Neighbor regions rung, Spreading Amazement all y? way Where e'r it travelled: yet they Who heard it, were Roused with fear And wonder, not So much at that As at y? Childs miraculous Fame, Which w?? a louder Eccho came And pierc'd their Hearts: what will He prove, say They, Whose Birth through Wonders makes its Noble way? Why, He will prove all to be true That Gabriel did of Him forshow, He will not prove a Man for you, Nor for y? Life professd below. Betimes He grows Angell, &amp; knows A way to ease His Soule of these So weildy worldly clogs: into The Deserts freedome He can goe Living alone with God, &amp; learning there Of Him how He his Sons way must prepare. He thinks not much to leave behind Those dainty Clothes, w?? lay y? Mind Open &amp; naked: He can wear A suit of harsh, &amp; homely hair; And so appeare More fine by far In Heavns strait view, Then finest you: A simple Thong girds Him as well As all your massy Belts, w?? swell With Pearle &amp; gold, this being garnished by The richest Gemme, poorest Humility. Though for his Portion, He might call Unto you yet He leaves them all, All those soft sweets, w?? may invite Your Learned Palates to delight: From those w?? you Away doe throw In fatt disdaine, He doth refraine As viands too too delicate For Him, who at a cheaper rate Can live &amp; serve his God: poore Locusts are With wilde &amp; casuall Honey, all his cheare. And chear enough: No want hath He All whose Desires answered be. No Art of Luxurie can please A Soule with such accomplishd Ease Which sets her free From Slavery Unto this Dust. No rampant Lust Flies up &amp; blinds y? Eyes of John, Who Master of Himselfe alone, Can freely yeild what is so fully his Unto His Service, whom to serve is Blisse. III Thus waits He on His God, when loe The wondring World conspires to goe And pay Attendance unto Him, Judea &amp; Jerusalem Both leave their home, And Pilgrims come Unto y? Wilde And desert field, Yea Jordan summons all his streame Thither to come &amp; meet w?? them; Such is y? Conflux, y? y? Wildernesse And that alone no Desert doth confesse. The Noble Preacher now begins Battle to bid against those sins, Which fought w?? Heavn, &amp; in its way Did thick &amp; Foule obstructions lay. Take downe, He cries, Those Mounts which rise So high, &amp; fill Those gaps of Hell, That so a Path all smooth may meet And kisse your Makers gratious feet. Pave all His way with Hearts, but let them be Gentle &amp; soft, for such a One is He. Yet if you rugged make his Path, He can be like to it: in wrath Upon you can He trample, and Has Hell &amp; Death at his Command. If you will prove Good wheat, his love And Armes shall be Your Granarie: But if his righteous Fan shall finde You worthlesse chaffe, his Angers winde, Which kindled y? eternall flames, shall cast You headlong in by its all-potent Blast. O turne in time, &amp; with your tears Both quench y? fire, &amp; drowne my fears. Repent, &amp; He will doe so too, Who has decreed to overthrow All y? withstand His mighty hand. Soone will He heer In power appeare And you in Spirit &amp; Fire baptize: O hearken then, &amp; timely wise In Water first baptized be by Me So shall his Baptisme safe &amp; welcome be. As Jordans crowding Streames made haste Into y? Sea themselves to cast; So into his fair channell now All The converted People flow, Hasting to drench Themselves, &amp; quench Their thirsty Fire, Whose brave Desire Burnt all for Baptisme; now no more Trust They their Ceremonious store Of Legall Washings, which themselves did grow So foule, that now 'twas time to wash them too. Startled at this the High Priests take Advice about y? Point, &amp; make Upon debate a Joint Decree To send Ambassadors, &amp; see What was this John; Whither that Great One, On whom they had So long time fed Their highest Hopes, their deare Messias, Or the miraculous Elias Or some selected Prophet; for no lesse By his great Fame could they collect, then this. No, none of these, says He, am I; I am y? Voice sent out to crie, Make strait y? Way, &amp; clear y? room That God unto his World may come. Though Mighty He Comes after Me, Yet does He too Before Me goe; As far before, as He could be Ev'n By compleat Eternitie. And I poor worme unworthy am to loose Ev'n but y? latchet of my Makers shoes. Peace humble Saint, for He must be Immediately baptiz'd by Thee. The more unworthy Thou dost deeme Thy selfe, y? worthyer dost Thou seeme To Heavn &amp; Him; Who on y? brimme Of Jordan now Himselfe doth show, And wooe's thy Hand to wash him there. O no, cries John, Deare Lord forbeare, How can pollution wash such Puritie? All need have I to be washd clean by Thee. And so Thou shalt: Yet say not no, Now thy great Lord will have it so. Humilitie if once it side With Disobedience, swells to Pride. He needs not be Washed by Thee, But means to make Thy Hands partake Of nobler Puritie, whilst They In washing Him his Will obey; Whilst on that Sacred Head they water poure, Which Gods owne hand had dew'd w?? Oile before. Now willing growne, yet trembling too About his great Work He doth goe; A Work so royall &amp; so High As might Archangells dignifie, Yet deignd to none But humble John, His Hands w?? were More pure &amp; faire Then Jordans silver flood, he fills With it, &amp; then with reverence spills It on y? Head of JESUS; &amp; before His venerable feet his Soule doth poure. IIII This Busines done to Court He goes, A fitting Match to deal w?? Those Illustrious high borne Sins, w?? there In silks &amp; Gold doe domineere; And which sometime Are seen to climbe Up to y? Throne And reigne alone Both over Prince &amp; People too; And Herods Court was tainted so: The Tetrarch rules y? numerous Multitude Whilst by no fewer sins He is subdue'd. But John, who no displeasure feares, But His, whose Throne's above y? Sphears Dares bid y? Prince beware how He Offends an higher Majestie. Herod give eare, Says He, &amp; heare What word to Thee Heavn sends by Me. Tis not thy Kingdome that can buy Thy Brothers Bed: O why should thy Fond lust, &amp; old Herodias dearer be Then thy Gods Law, &amp; thine owne Soule to Thee? Unto thy choise indulgent Heavn The fullnes of y? world hath given, Nor is Herodias alone The Noble &amp; y? beauteous One: A lawfull Love As sweet may prove; And blesse thy Bed With nobler Seed. Could all y? world no Females show But that Herodias, yet Thou Must not have Her: but now thy choise is free, Take Thee some other Queen, &amp; prosperous be. What fire so fierce as that of Lust When into furie it doth burst? Is Herod King, &amp; must He be Bridled by such a Thing as He? What, must a young Poor Preachers Toung Limit his Love? Must He remove Out of his Breast his dearer Heart And Him, &amp; his Herodias part? Forbid it all my Might, &amp; Kingdome, cries The Prince: The Saucy Preacher surely dies. Whilst in his Breast this furie burnes, Into his Minde y? thought returnes How bright in all y? Peoples eyes Johns Sanctitie &amp; Name did rise. To murder him Whom they did deem A Prophet, might Their Zeale incite To flat Rebellion, &amp; y? King Unto a lost Condition bring: Yea They perhaps, what He had preached, by force Might execute, &amp; hasten a Divorce. Yet must not He escape, nor I Be Prince in vaine, still He shall die, Though in a Death silent &amp; long: I have a Prison dark &amp; strong, Where He shall have His larger Grave, Whilst I doe live And freely give My Soule unto all Joyes in Thee Herodias, my Felicitie. And thus y? zealous Saint imprisoned is, And sent to trie a straiter wildernes. Now foolish Herod fearing none To check his lust, goes cheerly on. His Birthday comes, &amp; as if now He liv'd anew, He means to show His Princely Joy; That merry Day To consecrate To Pompe &amp; State, His Nobles all must feasted be At this his grand Solemnitie. And young Herodias w?? her charming dance The entertainements value must inhance. The King is set, &amp; set are all The Nobles in y? royall Hall. In comes y? Nymph &amp; feeds their eyes With daintier Varieties Then those, w?? were The Tables chear: Her amorous face Beauties owne Glasse, Her robes, y? most accomplishd dresse Of all illustrious Comelinesse: But when her gracefull Dance She measures, all Their Hearts trip after Her about the Hall. Filld with delight, like some mad Lover, In a wilde Oath y? King runs over; By Heavn, He cries, &amp; as I'm King Ask Me, Herodias, any thing; Challenge of Me If it like Thee Halfe of this Throne I sit upon; Herod unworthy were to be A Prince, if unrewarded He Let goe thy Merit: say what must I give, In this deep debt thy soveraigne must not live. The Younger Witch runs to her Dame, And gives account how Shee did frame Her soft inchantments, w?? did wring This usefull promise from y? King; All thanks, says Shee, Dear Child, to Me Thou dost restore What I before Gave Thee, ev'n Life; I now againe Shall live, &amp; like a Queen shall reigne. Ask that bold Preachers Head, &amp; I shall be From all his raylings &amp; aspersions free. Back goes y? Dancer, &amp; does pray A Dish of Meat might be her Pay, That she as well as all y? rest Might with her Mother goe &amp; feast. Let Herod now Performe his vow, Cries She, &amp; on His happy Throne For ever flourish; the Desire Of his poor Handmaid shall aspire No higher then y? wretched Head of John; This in a Dish I ask, &amp; this or none. Herod starts at y? Word, &amp; tries How He might put on Sorrows guise; Else it might seem a Plot between Him, &amp; his deep inraged Queen How to betray The saint to Day. Alas, sayes He, Too late I see The rashnesse of my rampant vow, And must be wondrous wicked now That I may not be so: foule Crueltie Alone from Perjurie can rescue Me. All yee, my Lords, are Witnesse how Profound &amp; solemne was my Vow: My Honour &amp; my Honestie Deeply in it ingaged lie: O could but I With safetie, I would betray Both these to Day Rather then John: But now, alas, Inslaved to Herodias I'm not my selfe: then fetch his Head; but say 'Twas Rashnes &amp; not Herod Him did slay. Yes glozing Tyrant, it is Thou, Who dost pretend, but breakst thy Vow: No more then halfe thy Kingdome was Ingage'd to spruce Herodias: Let Her have that, But let her not Incroach &amp; call For more then all. Farr More then all is this, that Shee And angry Lust doe ask of Thee, More then thy totall Kingdome &amp; thy Crowne, The Baptists Head is worth more then thine owne. Well, be it worth a World, it must Be yeilded to y? Dancers Lust; Who to her Mother dances in Bearing y? fruit of her bold sin. Look heer, she cries, I have y? prize, A Dish I bring You from y? King Wheron your eyes, your Heart, your Spight May feed with uncontrolld delight. Madame be free, loe ev'n y? Preacher now Your pleasure serves, &amp; to your Will doth bow. Mock not, Herodias. Rescue'd John From both his Prisons now is gone Unto a Feast more Princely far Then Herod has provided heer; Thou hast made this Birthday prove His The Day, y? sends Saints to their ends Opes them a new Nativitie Unto a Life, that cannot die. John lives to day, nor dost Thou dance alone; In Paradise they dance, where John is gone. One Dance for Thee is still behind By which Revenge thy Crime will find: The Ice perfidious to Thee, But unto Justice true shall be, When it shall catch Thy neck, &amp; snatch Its Head away, Which there shall play And dance a tragik Measure on That fatall Pavement: then shall John W?? greater glory view Thee from his Sphear, Then Herod at his Feast beheld Thee heere. S. Peter True, 'tis thy time foule Nero; Thou Mayst be more then Devill now, And venture on this Saint, w?? Hell Hath often felt &amp; fear'd: full well This Work thy monstrous Hand doth fit, Which blusheth not itself to wet In thine owne Mothers Heart, &amp; write The King of Tyrants. just &amp; right It is y? Emperour should see His conquerd God revenged bee: Now thy bruised Simon dies This other Simons Sacrifice; It will become Thee Him to slay Who of thy God hath won y? Day. Foolish Tyrant, dost Thou know What Thou art about to doe? Know'st Thou that Thou takst away Not thy Tutor Seneca, But y? Worlds great Master, One On whom y? education Of greater Things then Thou depends, One, whose school it selfe extends Much further then thy Empire, by Thy stoutest Eagles wings could fly? Knowst Thou that thine owne hand shall be The ladder, by whose Service He To Heavn shall climbe, who but ev'n now Thy soaring God pulld downe so low? Thither shall He climbe &amp; yet Leave firm &amp; sure his reverend Seat; For thy proud Rome shall see his Throne Flourish, when thine is dead &amp; gone. What though He but a Fisher be? Illustrious is his Trade, for He Useth no bait, but what is more Worth, then this Imperiall store: His Hook's a noble Crosse, &amp; this With a Kingdome baited is; Eternall Crowns are fastned on it; Blisse &amp; all Heavn hang upon it; Doe Thou thy Selfe but Bite, &amp; He Can catch, &amp; thither draw up Thee. Yet if His Blood be all that thy Desire does thirst for, He can Die: He can Die with more delight Then Thou canst Live: thy fiercest Spight Can mingle no such deadly Cup But He can thirst to drink it up, And find Life in its bottome: He Counts it but Death to Live w?? Thee, Seing his Lord &amp; Life long since Was returned home from hence. And hearty thanks He gives unto Thy furie, which contrives it so, That by y? same illustrious step After his Lord He may goe up. Had He his choise of all thy store Of Torments, none would tempt Him more Then this fair Crosse, w?? bounteous Thou On his Ambition doth bestow, Who would not halfe so willing be To climbe thy Royall Throne w?? Thee. This is that Tree, w?? reacheth up To highest Heavns its Noble Top; Whose boughs through all y? world doe spread, And a wholesome shadow shed; Whose foot tramples y? Head of Hell, And all its envious Powers doth quell: The Tree, w?? bare no fruit but God When in Calvarie it stood. Look now how rare Humilitie Plucks back y? Saint from this fair Tree: This Altar is too great, He cries, For so mean a Sacrifice; My Masters Throne of Torment is Too Royall for my Worthlessnesse: Were some Cherub here to die, This Ingine Him would dignifie; Alas any unhonourd way Of Death would serve poor Me to slay; The best of Crowns, dear Martyrdome Though in y? meanest Shape it come, Will bring sufficient Glory. Yet If needs I must aspire to it, May I have leave to show that I Desire'd not in this Pompe to die: So hang Me that my Head below Its dying Kisses may bestow Upon the reverend foot of this Great Seat my Master once made His. None but this fashion can agree With my unequall Dignitie; When their Kings honours Servants crowne Tis fit y? upside should be downe. Thou hast thy Wish, meek Saint, to this Request y? Tyrant liberall is; And smiles that He has learned to day To Crucifie a new found way. Now doe thy feet point to y? Place Whither Thou must straitway passe; And turned quite away art Thou Allready from all Things below; A sweet Advantage by thy new Torment doth to Thee accrew, Which with thy humble Project's even Now Thou lookest downe to Heavn. Heaven a Place to Thee well knowne Into whose hand y? Keys were throwne, A Place w?? will to Thee restore Thy Heart lodgd there so long before; A Place much higher, Nero, then He is falln below a Man. A Place, where Thou shalt meet w?? thine And with Heavns Blisse, y? most Divine Eyes of JESUS, from whose Beames The Way of Life &amp; Glory streames. S. James y? Apostle S. Marc. i. 19-20. Love walking once by y? sea side A knot of busy Fishers spide: And why may I not fish, said He, Who made the Fishes, &amp; y? Sea? Good reason Mighty Love that Thou Where Thou dost please thy bait shouldst throw: And happy They, who can but be A free &amp; willing Prey to Thee. O what commanding Power doth wait Upon thy more then golden Bait! How instantly doth James forget The mending of his broken Net, And finds y? He needs more to be Mended, &amp; made whole by Thee! No sooner did thy blessed Call Ring in his Heart, but, Farewell all, Cries He, &amp; welcome more then so; I to a greater Sea must goe, A Sea of Bliss &amp; Joy w?? I Now standing on y? Shoar descry. Dear Sire, bear w?? this short Adieu, Loe there my Father more then you; He, who on you did Me bestow Calls for his owne, &amp; I must goe. Goe gentle Soule, &amp; Captive be Unto y? best of Libertie. A fairer Ship then this Thou leav'st Thou by a blest exchange receiv'st: The Holy Church a Vessell is All built &amp; riggd, &amp; fraught w?? blisse: Thou shalt a fishing goe againe, But in y? Worlds more Noble Maine, And learned in thy Masters Art, Catch such as is thine owne soft Heart; Untill mistaken Herods hand Shall draw thy labours unto land, And drive Thee w?? his murdring Sword To Lifes fair Shoar, to thy Dear Lord. S. Bartholomew Surely this Gold's but Earth, although Through throngs of Tempests it can draw The greedy West Into y? East And make y? Ocean crowd into The Mouth of Inde: And will none goe To finde a Prize more golden then That glittering Ore, th' eternall Soules of Men? Yes, here's a Merchant ready; He, Were India more Worlds off, can be Content to passe Them all: He has A fairer gale then ever from The Mouth of any Winde did come; Full in his Sail God's Spirit blows, And not to fetch, but carry Gold, he goes. If Gold be not a Name too poor, To print upon his Noble store; The pretious Wares He thither bears Are genuine Peace, &amp; boundlesse Blisse, And Loves, &amp; Joyes, &amp; Paradise: For these &amp; more inshrined lie In JESU'S Name, Heavns best Epitomie. With this He trades, yet not to make Him selfe, but India rich: Come take Your choise, He cries, In this great Prize; Indeed tis richly worth much more Then all your idolized Ore; But you may goe on Trust for this, Give but your Faith, &amp; yours y? Treasure is. His market thus in India done, Unto Armenia He doth run To traffique there With y? same ware. A Braver Merchant ne'r did come Into those parts; &amp; there were some That dealt with Him, who quickly thrive Getting wherwith eternally to live. But having undertook to make His Chapmen Kings, y? King doth take High discontent To hear Him vent Doctrines so bold; No more, cries He, Of your Christs Kingdome; there shall be In my Armenia but one And thats mine owne undoubted lawfull Throne. The Gods by whose assistance I Ascended to this Royaltie Are Gods enough: I can allow Thy uselesse Christ no room, &amp; yet Thy selfe maist for some use be fit. Say Slaves, will He not serve to flea? Though He be naught, yet good his skin may be. Mistaken Tyrant, what canst Thou And this thy tardy Torment doe? Long since our Saint Without constraint Threw off y? Worlds unworthy skins The foolish furniture of Sins; Yea &amp; y? Flesh: what matter then For Him to lay aside his weary Skin? Take then thy most unconquerd Prey; And for y? skin Thou pluckst away Array Him round With one great Wound: Trie if thy Spight can boundlesse prove As are His Patience &amp; his Love: Send Him more naked hence then He Came hither at his first Nativitie; So! now far fairer then before, He sparkles in his glorious Gore As y? stript Sun The Clouds being gone Though naked yet more beauteous is By that illustrious Nakednes, Having no shame to hide, w?? may Beholding be to some more spruce array. What e'r y? stupid Tyrant think, The wiser Devills back doe shrink, And dare not look On this red book The Saints owne Rubrick, or once come Neere so strong Beams of Martyrdome, But wish a thousand times y? skin Were on y? Noble Martyrs back agin. No; let y? King this token keep That he did slay y? harmelesse Sheep: Heavn will provide A Robe to hide The Saint; faire Immortalitie Into a garment fram'd shall be, A garment full &amp; fit, whose hue Though ever worne, keeps ever fresh &amp; new. Goe then, Great Saint, unto thy Place Much richer then thy India was, A Place too high For Tyranny To reach Thee thence: there shalt Thou see The Crowne &amp; Throne prepard for Thee, Who to be sure to enter in At Heavns strait Gate, didst first put off thy skin. S. Matthew O love Thou art Almighty! This Sole Day can prove Thee so, w?? is Not onely Matthews, but from thence The Feast of thy Omnipotence. Thy single Word did not to day Blow sturdy Mountains far away, Or cite y? East into ye West, Or fright y? Centre from its Nest; But more then so, draw from its Seat The Publican, about whose feet Hung cloggs of Gold: cloggs heavier far Then Centres, Worlds, or Sorrows are, Except those Griefs w?? hung on Thee When Thou wert hung on Calvarie. How safe did Matthew sit upon The most inchanting thriving Throne Of constant Gains, w?? with full tide Came crowding in on every side, And onely bid Him ope his Chest To let it in! How amply blest Would thousands write themselves, if they So cheaply could such wealth injoy, Though more then one Damnation were Tie'd in its Traine! But LOVE'S words are Richer then Riches: Matthew now Forgets Golds price, w?? He doth throw With all its hopes away, &amp; choose Bare Povertie as by it goes: For LOVE had put it on, &amp; He No sooner cries come follow Me But as a faithfull Eccho to The Word, y? ready Saint doth goe. No Scruple, no demurre; he knew Twas LOVE that calld, &amp; LOVE that drew. Twas LOVE, &amp; He his Tribute can As well as Caesar claime from Man. Michaelmasse What though our languid Songs cannot aspire (Justly termd AIRES, because they reach no higher) Yours Noble Spirits, make large supply, Whose loftie Key Doth well agree With Him, whose Name you eccho, the MOST HIGH. The TRIPLE ONE &amp; UNDIVIDED THREE, In your mysterious Consorts Unitie For ever sounds, whose gallant praise As you chant there All Heavn you chear And make it, &amp; its Stars dance roundelays. Whither some Seraphik, or Cherubik Throats Lead up y? ravishing Verse in Single Notes, Before y? full Quire thunders in: Or whither all Together fall Upon y? Song, the Musik still doth win, It wins y? ear, &amp; wins y? favour too Of Him, whom all your loud TRISAGUIMS doe Strive to extoll: HE all things made That Prayses they To Him might pay, And best likes those, who follow best their Trade. Close doe you follow it, while ravishd by Your owne exstatic Notes, your Soules doe flie Along w?? them, untill they beat Strongly upon Gods Mighty Throne And so rebound againe unto their Seat. By this sweet intercourse your Hearts doe goe In glorious pleasure trading to &amp; fro: And whilst a veil forbids your Eye Your liscense'd Toungs By their free Songs Carry you close unto y? Deitie. O happy Yee, whose undisturbed Quire Can be as lasting as your owne Desire, And fears not to be silence'd by Mischeivous Zeale Or ever feele A Reformation by Impietie. Sing on Sweet Spirits, &amp; pay our common King What We, alas, can onely wish to bring. Yet if We ever doe arrive (As We desire) At your great Quire Wee'l take our Parts, &amp; sing as long's We live. For many a Place We know there vacant is, Since your false Brethern Sung their Parts amisse And made flat Discord in y? Song. The fault was great, And They unfit Unto y? Quire of Angels to belong. Let them &amp; their untuned Genius dwell Deep in y? correspondent Jarrs of Hell: But Heavn forbid that your fair Quire Imperfect be; Rather may we, And our sad Groans, to your sweet Tunes aspire. S. Luke What though some monstrous Things y? wear Physitians Names, &amp; Looks, And all things but their Books, The onely licence'd Murderers are, Traders in Deaths, w?? They so dear doe sell, That They undoe oftimes before they kell? The Art is Noble still, &amp; can Bid Death her distance keep Though Age gins to be steep, And downward bends y? hoary Man: Physik is Lifes Reserve, &amp; can make way For routed Nature not to loose y? Day. And in this potent Art our Saint A Master was: yet He Ambitious is to be Skilld deeper yet, &amp; to acquaint With Mystik Physik, w?? may both restore And make his Patients Live for evermore. In y? fair Beds of Paradise He searcheth every Place To find each herb of grace, In which most heavnly virtue lies. And makes a Soveraigne Purge, whose Power divine Serves to clense Hearts, &amp; grossest Soules refine. But His cheife Simple is that Tree, Upon whose every Bough And Leaf pure Life doth grow; And this his JESUS is, whom He Folds up in Papyr, &amp; doth freely send For all sick soules to y? Worlds furthest end. No Physik like to Gospell is, Which He himselfe did trie Upon himselfe, &amp; by Its virtue still doth live: Tis this Which purgeth all Corruption, &amp; doth wring The deadly poyson from Deaths conquerd sting. SS. Simon &amp; Jude When LOVE the King of bounty, did Look over all his year, Newfound &amp; glorious things He spread To make it rich &amp; fair. He sprinkled on y? foremost Day Gemms dugg from his owne veins, And gave his foreskin to array, And hide y? New years stains. Another speciall Day He did Paint full &amp; fair all over, For all His Noble Blood He shed In Purple it to cover. But when His owne dear veins were drie, He borrows of his Friends And other Days to dignifie, The Martyrs Blood He sends. Betimes this privileg'd Day did get A rich &amp; double share: Two Noble Casks abroach were set To wash &amp; dresse it fair. Two rich Apostolike streams did run With full &amp; liberall Tyde, And joyning both their floods in one In this Days Channell glide: Upon whose either bank each one Their reverend Name did spread; Since when in this Days Stile alone Simon &amp; Jude are read. All Saints The year although A long &amp; tedious Thing till now; Grows scant &amp; narrow, And glad to borrow A cleanly shift, wherby To wait on Pietie. Religion hath outvie'd its Days, &amp; bred More Saints then could with Feasts be furnished. For Saints indeed Are not Times flitting brittle Breed, But borne to be Eternallie; Nor can y? years poor Round Their great Dimensions bound For whom y? fairest Sphears extended be; Saints must impeople Heavns Immensitie. Wherfore seing this One Day for all selected is, Let its full Glory Outshine y? story Of all y? year beside, Now grown lesse fair &amp; wide Then these few Hours, the vast Epitomie Of what excelld y? years Capacitie. As when We see In one rich Mixtures Unitie Each Tribe &amp; kinde Of Sweets combinde, And by Art taught to dwell In one small chrystall cell, Such is y? quintessentiall Confluence We Finde in this single generall Feast to be. A Feast of Feasts Where holy Hearts (its onely Guests) Finde every Dish Exceed their Wish: For all y? Morsells be Themselves Feasts, yet agree To shrink their bulke, &amp; so contracted lie In the rich lap of this Festivitie. There lie the pure Conserves of Lillies, good to cure An Heart or Eye Thats blemishd by (A smoothe but rankling Rust) The burning Spot of Lust: Some call them Angells, sent to shine below, Others, the Virgin Tribe of flaming Snow. Next these, are store Of purple Dainties colourd o're With their own juice Of speciall use To chear the Heart, &amp; make It manly courage take. These are of sundry sorts, yet all doe come From one red Fount of Noble Martyrdome. The third Course is Though not so rich in hue as this, Yet full &amp; faire And may compare With that delicious store Which was servd up before For sundry Virtues, as in number farre It them transcends for these Confessors are. Illustrious Day, In which y? whole year doth display It selfe, &amp; more! O may our poore Praises, &amp; poorer We Have leave to wait on Thee. Our vilenesse sure the Saints will not despise, Whose Honour first from Lowlines did rise! S. Mary Magdalen's Ointment Forbid Her not, nor ask a reason why. She is in Love And means to prove The Sacred Boldnes of LOVE'S Mysterie. Who asks a Reason why y? Zealous Fire Will owne no Rein Which may restrain Her venturous Flames, and say, Ascend no higher? Marie's on fire: and such stout Fire as fears No ocean streams To check its flames, Which burnes amidst a Sea of brinie Tears. These Waters, &amp; those Flames in Her brave Eyes Both have their Place, Both have their grace, And stoutly strive which should the higher rise. If Shee will be profuse, oh let Her be. LOVE'S mystik Art Knows how t' impart Virtue's true grace of Prodigalitie. The Box is dear, is not Her Heart so to? Then let Her choose Which Shee will loose; That, or her Heart must break; LOVE chargeth so. O generous Odours! Ne'r did Thriftie Love Admirers meet With halfe so sweet Perfumes, when saving Prudence her did move. Fresh from his Alabaster Prison flies The Noble Smell, Whose riches fill The sweetned Earth, &amp; reach th' applauding skies. Stop Her not now: See how her genuine Fire Takes its true course And with full force To Heavn it selfe directly doth aspire. For what is Heavn, if not sweet JESU'S head Whose glorious eyes Gild all y? skies With purer beams then Phaebu's Look can shed. Sweet Sacrifice! But sweeter Altar far! The Altar where This Offerer Doth dedicate her Nard, Gods Temples are. What, does this rare Effusion ad a glance Of pleasing grace To JESU'S face, And make in God a cheerfull Countenance? Sure He approves it well: Engedie's Bed, Or Libanus Ne'r pleasd Him thus, Nor Edens Hills, w?? liquid Spices shed. Smile all y? Sweets, whose Kindred doth advance You to be nere This Ointment here: That rich Relation will your price inhance. And Courage Lovers: JESUS will allow Your Noble Passion Immoderation, Who was excessive in His Love to you. But Thou Brave Woman, &amp; thy pretious Name More sweet then was Thy Nard, shall pass And fill th' eternall Mouth of holy Fame. Lemniscus ad Columnam S. Simeonis Stylitae appensus For still y? reverend Pillar stands, And all religious eyes commands. Still it stands erected high On fairest Mount of Memorie: High as y? top of highest Glorie, Which writes from hence its noblest Storie. Higher then the PRINCE of FLIES With his swarthy Wings can rise: High as y? flight of soules: as high As LOVE'S illustrious Wing could flie. As high as is the loftie pitch Lowest Humilitie can reach. No Pillar ever higher stood But that which shin'd w?? Gods dear Blood. Faire Mark indeed, w?? could invite The earlyest Morne &amp; latest Night, The East &amp; West to leave their home, And into Syria Pilgrims come. Look with what haste huge Torrents straine To crowd themselves into y? Maine: With as full &amp; speedy Tide Nations flow from every side Into this Sea of Wonders. Some To feed their Admiration come: Some for health, some for Protection, Some for Counsell &amp; direction. Ne'r did so thick Devoto's follow The Oracle of Old Apollo, Though He through all y? World did goe For Physiks God &amp; Wisdomes too. Ne'r could usurping Dieties To such exuberant honour rise, As doth from all Quarters presse JESU'S SERVANTS feet to kisse. HIS SERVANT, &amp; no more but so, Is He to whom these Glories flow. Honour turnes Servant unto them, Who faithfull Service pay to Him. If Simeons noble soule disdaine To wait upon y? Worlds proud Traine; The World shall humble prove, &amp; be Servant to his Humilitie. Humilitie layd sure &amp; low Is y? root from whence did grow Those Palms &amp; wreathes, whose thick imbraces Caught Him with the noblest graces Of never sought for Fame. His first Acquaintance with y? World was nurst Among Things like himselfe; poor Sheep And simple innocent Lambs to keep Was all his young Preferment; low And mean enough, you'l say; but know To Him it seemd too high: His Crook Did something like a SCEPTER look, And all his FLOCK like SUBJECTS stand And goe as He changd his Command. Ev'n honours Shades &amp; Emblems are Too fair for his meek Soule to wear. He thinks it work enough to keep Himselfe, whilst others govern Sheep. And all his Wishes onely strive In some safe Fold a Lamb to live. No Fold so safe immure'd can be As a Monastik Cell, says He. High mounted on Devotions wing Thither hasts this simple Thing, And shrowded in that narrow Nest He shuts out all y? World, y? rest And He more room might get, then now Th' excluded Universe could show: Room to traverse Heavn, &amp; see The Crest of all Sublimitie: Room to lodge all Virtue's Traine, Room his God to entertaine; Room where all his Forces may Mustered &amp; set in array With confidence bid battle to His &amp; Pieties Mighty Foe. Light Skirmages had often past Between these Champions, till at last The Saint resolves about the Spring The utmost of his Power to bring Into y? Field. Twas strange to see What kind of Ammunition He Store'd up against y? Fight: all Lent He in Fortifying spent; Good store of Faith He did provide, And regarded naught beside. Meat &amp; Drink were things too gross And cumbersome for Him, who was With Spirits to fight: Forty long dayes His silence'd Appetite obeys, Whilst his stout Soule did thrive &amp; feast With one perpetuall perfect Fast. His treacherous Flesh quickly fell downe, All his false Friends away were blowne, His Lusts grew tame, &amp; every Passion To his brave Will it selfe did fashion. Unto his great Designe most true And trusty every Member grew. Thus to y? Combate did He goe Neer as much Spirit as his Foe. Simple Foe! The Plot He layd Is long before the fight betrayd: The World &amp; Flesh, w?? He dispos'd In ambuscado, are disclos'd, And y? Poore &amp; pined Saint Victorious is in being faint; Proving y? Staffe of Bread to be No necessary weapon; He Without it lives &amp; fights, Gods Word Serves Him for food &amp; for a Sword. No marvell if He conquers, who Makes extream weaknes potent grow, By casting from Him all Defense But onely Gods Omnipotence. Little remains of Simeon; God fights, &amp; almost God alone. This Strategeme found such successe That henceforth He doth professe It as his Trade; No Spring but He Incounters thus his Enemie; And whilst He other food denyes Diets Himselfe w?? Victories. Now twas time no more to dwell In Obscurities dark Cell: Heavn dar'd venture Him abroad In some large &amp; fair Abode, Large as his mighty Soule, &amp; fair As his high Atchievments were. His loftie Theater shall be An emblem of his Constancie, A Pillar stout &amp; tall set forth To y? view of Heavn &amp; Earth; That mounted in y? Aire on high That Elements Prince He may defie, And Angells, Men, &amp; God may fill Their eyes w?? this brave Spectacle. Brave Spectacle indeed! Great Rome Had no such noble sight at home, No Pillar Arch, or Monument Of conquerd Worlds gave such content As this one Column: wherfore Shee With devout Humilitie Its Shadow borroweth, to gild All her Streets, w?? now are filld With copied Simeon: every Door Henceforth will ope &amp; shut no more But under His Protection, who Ingraven stands above to show On whose stout Prayers &amp; Charitie Th' Inhabitants within relie. And in these senselesse Shapes indeed The Saint might stand long years, &amp; need No reliefe: but how shall He Advance soft Flesh &amp; Blood to be Of Marbles Constitution, and Unmoved as his Pillar stand? The World now staggers at y? sight, Grows jealous that it sees not right: And One y? Speaker for y? rest Humbly doth y? Saint contest To clear Ages Jealousie And his Temper to descry; To speak whether his Metall were No other then it did appeare: Whither it were not of y? same Pure cast, whence Heavn did Angells frame, Whose blessed Wings still fann away All y? wearines which They May seem to gather as they flie On Errands round about y? skie. A gracefull Blush quickly made good That Simeon guilty was of Blood: And that his Flesh was truly so, A deep ingraven Mark will show; Which now He could no longer hide, He shews his foot: where loe a wide Mouth of a putrifyed Wound Drops large confession on y? ground. Look heer, says He, how rottennesse Gins Me already to possesse, And judge whither I a Spirit be, Or weaker Worme then these you see, Which on my foot in Triumph pray Unto my Heart eating their way. O mighty Patience! Simeon As sure &amp; steady stands upon This most vexatious gnawing wound As stood his Pillar on y? ground: And fighting with Immortall Foes Indures from Wormes those piercing Woes, If yet they pierce Him, &amp; all sense Of Mortall Pains be not long since Quite drownd in that exuberant Sea Of his Angelik Fervencie, Whose Mystik Power hath made Him now All Soule: Sure Simeon feels no blow Nor wound, but those, w?? LOVE'S sweet Darts Bestow on Saints Delicious Hearts. Twas LOVE, which on y? Pillar set Him as his fairest Mark, whereat To aime, &amp; trie his Heavnly skill, Which w?? Darts of Life doth kill, And in ten thousand Deaths doth give A sweet Necessitie to Live: To Live a LIFE of WOUNDS, but those So healing, that y? Soule would choose Rather Ease's Pangs, then not By those Arrows to be shot. LOVE shot full oft, &amp; every Dart Flew directly to the Heart Of this fair Mark; At last He cries, Mine alone, Mine is y? Prize: The Tempters Arrows are in vain, Mine alone the Man have slain: Mine He is, &amp; Mine shall be; No Title to Himselfe hath He: Him I challange by y? Law Of greatest Arms, &amp; mean to draw Him home in Triumph after Me In token of my Victorie. Then farewell Noble Captive, goe, Thy Conqueror will make Thee so: No state so glorious is, &amp; free, As that of Thy Captivitie. That holy Appetite, which thy Long Fasts begot, shall satisfie Itselfe with Heavn: far higher now Then was thy loftie Pillar, Thou Shalt be exalted, &amp; above In y? warme bosome of thy LOVE Be payd for thy cold Station heer. Farewell, Brave Soule, &amp; though thy Sphear Be too high for Us, &amp; our Poor Songs to reach, yet will we poure Them on y? noble Place of thy Dear feet, &amp; heap our Prayses high To crowne thy Column, or to be Crowned by its Nobilitie. S. Gregorie Nazianzen May 9. Ne'r would I owne this thing of mine, Which some perhaps a Muse will call, If it forgets to wait on Thine, Which comprehends y? Other Muses all. For more of them ne'r dwelt upon Learned Parnassus double Head Then harbour in thy single one, And finde this latter house best furnished. Furnished with holy store Of nobler Raptures then till now Snatchd Poets Soules away, &amp; bore It far above these grosser Things below: Raptures of purest Loves, wherby Thy Heart on Angells Wings did soar Unto a pitch more fair &amp; high Then Graecian Quills e'r towred to before. By Thee to Heavn y? Muses rise, And ravishd in Divinitie Sing with Birds of Paradise Layes, which ennoble rescue'd Poetrie. Whither in Heroiks stately pace, Or nimble Lyriks softer dance, Or in grave Iambiks grace, Still dost Thou goe with matchlesse excellence. Illustrious Saint, thy noble Brow All crownd with everlasting Baies Thee Prince of Poetrie doth show, Who all y? Muses mak'st Urania's. Oft has my earthly Soule from Thee And thy rich lines suckd Heavnly Fire, Oft have I kiss'd thy leaves, w?? be The sweet Incentives of devout Desire. Fain would I eccho something back Though faint, &amp; short of thy due Praises; Which though thy Honour doth not lack, My Pen to Thine, &amp; Thee, these Altars raises. I And this, Dear Saint, must be y? first layd Stone: Thou wert a Great before a little One; Son of thy Mothers Prayers wert Thou Before her Wombe with Thee did grow: For Nonna prayes That Heavn would raise Her Seed, which Shee Might yeild to bee Onely Heavns; And Heavn to Her Long Zeal doth bow its pleased ear: Aforehand it assumes thy prosperous Birth, Whilst in a Vision Nonna brings Thee forth. Unto her watchfull Soule did God display Thy figure, whilst her Body sleeping lay; Thy Person, &amp; thy genuine look She read in that miraculous Book: And with these, there Was written faire Thy vertuous Name, The very same, Which now Thou wearest, Gregorie E'r Thou wert born appeard to be Thy VIGILANT TITLE, who though shown in sleep Wert marked many a pious Watch to keep. Thus bigg with Hope, &amp; shortly bigg with Thee Nonna her reverend Wombe doth swelling see. Lighter grows Her Heart, as this Doth increase in Heavinesse; No Moneths, says she, Shall naseous be To Me, who here My Comfort beare, A Flowre of mine owne Seed, w?? may Flourish to Heavn another Day. No Longings shall stretch out my Soule, but one, By which I Long againe to see my Sonne. Now brings Shee forth &amp; all her Pangs are sweet, Which layd Her Holy Hopes before her feet. Gladly y? Infant Face Shee sees How with Heavns Modell it agrees, Each lineament Holds true consent, And this is Hee Her Gregorie: In a thousand joyfull kisses Thankfull Devotion Shee expresses, And renders God by Solemne Consecration What Shee receiv'd by His so kind Dignation. And now not as the Mother, but the Maid And nurse to Heavns great Pledge, she is afraid To use the Infant but as One, Whom God had made her foster-son: With tender Care She doth prepare All things y? may Another Day Proclaime as much: His tender Heart Shee seasons with religious Art, And brings Him up as if Shee Tutoresse were To educate some tender Angell heere. O happy Thou, to whom thy Mother can Give Thee a double Life to make Thee Man! Thou breathst y? Aire w?? Us below, And that, w?? doth in Heavns Fields blow; Ev'n Gods Great Spirit Thou doth inherit So soone, that how Thou dost not know: Thy blooming Budd is sweetned by The Gales of Paradise, which flie Thick in that breath, by which thy Mother makes Those blessed Words to Thee She dayly speakes. Thus in the best of Learning skilld, art Thou At length sent out the lesser Arts to know. To Greece, &amp; Greeces purest Fount, For such the World did Athens count, Thy course is bent, And well content Art Thou to goe Further then so If Learning further dwelt; let gold And hope of Gemmes make Others bold: Knowledge though ne'r so poor, can seem to Thee, Of worth enough to make Thee scorne the Sea. Yet thy Adventure dangerous doth prove: The Winds conspire, and all the Sea doth move It selfe against Thee; ne'r did waves Split into profounder Graves: No Tempest e'r Rended y? Aire W?? threats more loud, No Storme did crowd Fuller into any Bark; Highnoon Day ne'r grew more dark; Wrack &amp; Confusion never seemd to be More ripe, then these, which gape to swallow Thee. Feare &amp; Despair through all the Shipmen went, Whose Hearts more then their tatterd Sailes were rent. But yet the Stormes impatient Noise Scarse was higher then the Voice Of thy strong Cries, W?? which thine Eyes Their Floods did joine, And sighs combine Into a Tempest neer as great As that w?? on the vessell beat, So that the Sailers thought no more upon The other Storme, amaz'd at thine alone. Alas, Thou hadst not yet been drenched in Those Holy Streams, which serve to wash our Sin; And therfore fearst these Waves w?? can Destroy, but never save a Man. This makes thy Crie So strong &amp; high To Him, whose hand Could strait command The fiercest Ocean: never eare Did more violent Prayers heare: Ne'r did distressed Soule crie out like Thee, And that for Water in the swelling Sea. What Eyes can read thy Lamentation, and Not Sympathize with thine? My Soule doth stand Amazd, when in thy revernd Book Upon that tragik Leaf I look; Wondring what cries Can win the skies, If these w?? rend them Cannot bend them If any Tempest can outcrie Such importunate Fervencie. None can outcrie it: JESUS yeilds at last And into their owne Deeps the Waves doth cast. The Winds, as blown quite out of breath, are hurld Into their furthest corners of the World. Heavn doffs that clowdy veil, wherby The Storm hath dampt its beauteous Eye, And doth display A gentle Day Upon the Sea Now calme &amp; free, Which shews thy Ship her way unto The wished Port: thus dost Thou goe With weather beaten Safety to the Shoare, And this so brittle Life will trust no more: For to the Holy Fount Thou runnst apace There to be drenched in the Streams of Grace, That Thou henceforth no more mayst fear Whatever Tempest shall appeare. Where to expresse Thy Thankfulnesse, To Heavn dost Thou Present a vow Worthy of it &amp; Thee: Thy Toung Solemnly undertakes, how long Soe'r Thou liv'st from all Oaths to refraine: Thou strictly swearest ne'r to sweare againe. II All Athens now thy vast Capacitie Quickly drinks in, but is not filld therby: The Amplitude of every Art Made haste to lodge in thy large Heart Which entertaines them All, &amp; traines them Unto a pitch More high &amp; rich Then ever they had learnd to flie On Wings of Pagan Industrie. Thou best the Academie prove'st thy Mother By growing up thy selfe just such another. Though ruddy yeouths sleek smiles upon thy Face Still keep their modest dwelling, Thou dost passe For One all Gray within, Thy Braine Betimes is Age'd, y? doth containe More store of years By far then theirs, Whose wrinkled skin Doth reverence win Upon Presumption no Man could Live so long to be befoold; And turne a Child againe in Head, which He By Natures Rule, onely in feet should be. The Chaire is mounted, &amp; Thou must ascend. Young as Thou art, old Auditors will lend Their sober eares, &amp; much rejoice To hear their young Professors Voice; Who sweetly wise His gravnes ties To sprightfull wit, W?? loves to sit On yeouthfull subtile Toungs: All Greece Surpriz'd with admiration is At these thy Oracles, which make it follow Thee full as young, as was their wise Apollo. But that which Athens did to Thee indeare Was that thy Soule met with another there Right fit for thy sweet Company, A Soule, w?? did w?? thine agree In every part Of thy best Art, A Soule whose Pulse Beat nothing else But love &amp; Heavn, a Soule so nigh Resembling thine, that Amitie At length mistook, counting thy Heart to be In Basils Breast, &amp; his to pant in Thee. Never did Chance of Nature tie a knott Into so strait a Union, as that Which Virtues knitt, &amp; Graces tie In a Band of Pietie. Now Basil loves, And lives, &amp; moves In Gregorie; And mutuall He Loves Basil back againe, &amp; lives By that Life away He gives. Thus when two Floods imbrace, they loose each other In the pellucid Bosome of his Brother. Such noble Soules alone as thine can prize A worthy Friend aright: whatever lies In India's pretious bowells, is Not so golden gold as this; No radiant Gemme By whose rich beame The new rose East Is sprucest drest Such ravishing lustre forth doth send As this short Word, A WORTHY FRIEND. A Friend is Patience, Care, &amp; Secresie, Comfort, Advise, Help, &amp; Communitie. Thus wert Thou marryed to thy Masculine Spouse: When the Soule weds, no uselesse Sex she knows; And heere thy Soule, &amp; that alone Enters NUPTIALL UNION. No Female shall Think to prevaile By blandishment On thy consent: Though thy breast be large, yet Thou Hast but one Heart to bestow, And that is BASILS, who esteems it so That for the World He will not let it goe. Yet will a Paire of noble Wooers see What they can doe upon Thee: Faire they bee And Virgins both, who clothed by A beauteous Vision, to thine eye Themselves propose: What, must they lose Their loving pains In thy Disdains? Must the wrinkles of thy face Duer to smiles, themselves disgrace By turning Frowns? What needs Severity To ask these gentle Strangers what they be? Know their answer is: They Sisters are Descended from Heavns stock, &amp; come thus far To make Thee sure of what thy will Is most ambitious to fulfill; To ratifie Thy Puritie And to increase W? learned Greece Begun in Thee: nay Bothe beside Meane this night to be thy Bride: Heavn sent them on this busines, &amp; they be Prudence the One, the other Chastitie. Sweet are your Names, sayst Thou, but sweeter are Your royall Persons, which those Titles weare. Be it a Match; such Mayds as you Indanger not a Virgin Vow. Heer, take my Heart Never to part, Your Gregorie Will live &amp; die Your faithfull Spouse, if He but lend His help, who you did hither send. Thus, Glorious Saint, Thou putst thyselfe asleep Into that State, which waking Thou shalt keep. III Accomplishd Soule, I must have leave to be Of that Opinion, which was held of Thee By all the World except by thy Owne Paradox HUMILITIE. Such heavnly skill Thy Soule doth fill That none could be More fit then Thee For Heavns imployment, none more fit To help up humble Soules to it. No Head so furnishd to support aright A MITRES mystik unbeleeved weight. To thy most perspicatious Wisdome this Sacred &amp; glorious Errour proper is: Hadst Thou been like Us, lesse learn'd, Never had thy soule discernd The Pastorall Charge To be so large And huge a Load: Ne'r hadst Thou stood So nicely on thy weaknesse, as To prove more weak in letting pass So fair Preferment. We look now adayes How deep's the MITRES gilt, not what it weighs. Yet to thy awfull Parents Contestation And urgent Wills, thine owne Thou striv'st to fashion. Thy feeble Fathers Shadow now In his Dioceese art Thou; How bright so e'r The rays appear W?? break from Thee, Thou wilt not be More then so; Nay when this Throne And a full election After thy Fathers Death long wooed Thee, It could not conquer thy Humilitie. All Nazianzum likes not Thee so well As doth y? Pleasure of thy Pontik Cell; Where Thou thy Death canst antidate, And dwell in Heavn before thy fate Shall send Thee up; Where Thou canst crop And prune away All things that prey Upon our vitall Moisture, Pleasures, Preferments, &amp; superfluous Treasures; Possessing all thy Selfe intirely free From our vaine Worlds inchanting Tyrannie. Nor shall thy Basil Thee persuade to be Content to suffer Publik Dignitie, Or make Thee ever set upon The new erect Sasamean Throne. So deep doth this Designe of His Wound Thee &amp; thy Humilitie, That strong Complaints break out, whose course Runs so far, &amp; with such force, That much they did prevaile, &amp; had well nigh In sunder rent your Bond of Amitie. Yet can thy Resolutions not withstand Heavns providentiall overruling Hand: If Heavn please to appoint Thee Heir Ev'n to Constantinoples Chair Thou wilt not shrink Away, nor think Thy Selfe unfit Therin to sit: Thou wilt not shrink for any Storme, That Hell &amp; Heresie can arme Against thy single Head, that Head, whose sheild All Heavn becomes, when er Thou tak'st y? feild. This royall City was invenome'd by That part of Hell, which at the Trinitie Its poyson spits; Such potent Foes What Mortall now will dare oppose? What Valiant He Will Champion be, And stretch his hand To countermand The mighty Stream, w?? floweth forth First from Hell, &amp; then from Earth? Who dares divide his God, &amp; therby sow Division too among Mens Hearts below? Why, Gregorie without Division can Untie this knott, and in that Union A Triad find &amp; prove; no Net By Sophistik cunning set Can trap his feet, No swelling Threat Can terrifie His Constancie: JESUS is his God, and He That mystik Truth can prove to be As sure &amp; sound y? wondring Christians joine This Name to crowne his other, the DIVINE. He now becomes allmost the Rule wherby The Catholik World their faithfull Truths doe trie, And thus resolve their Questions: This Gregories Opinion is. This makes his foes Blush to propose Their Supurious Reason; No: They by Treason Will now dispute, &amp; take a Course Their Bishop to confute perforce. Their Argument acute &amp; strong shall be A desperate Sword manage'd by Crueltie. Fools as you are, now learne at least that He Whom Gregorie asserts has Dietie Enough to conquer Hell &amp; you: What makes your gallant Murderer throw His Sword away Without delay When he is come Into the room Appointed for the Murder? What Casts your Soldier downe so flat Before th' unarmed Saint, &amp; makes him pray For Pardon, to the Man He came to slay. But harmes which sometimes Foes cannot effect, Are easlyer done by those we least suspect; And they which wear y? Name of Friend Can soonest noblest Soules offend, Soules which know Full stoutly how To oppose Apparent Foes. Thy Friends and Mitred Brethern be The Host, Great Saint, w?? fights w?? Thee; The reverend Councill in thy Citty mett Grow emulous, and against thy Peace are set. Nor thine alone, but thy dear Mothers too, The Churches Peace by this they overthrow: A Peace w?? is more dear to Thee Then thy Throne &amp; Mitre be; Yea then thy Life, If so their Strife Will needs require: All thy desire Is thine owne Peace to sacrifice Unto thy Mothers; Thou canst prize No Patriarchall Dignitie so high, As with the Churches Quiet, Privacy. Yee holy Fathers, who are met to make Up all the Churches rents, oh hear me speak, Hear, sayst Thou this once from Me A Vote, which tends to Unitie: The Storms w?? heer So high appeare Perchance may cease In blessed Peace, If worthlesse I like Jonas be Resigned to the gaping Sea. Heer therfore I renounce my envy'd Throne More freely, then I put my Mitre on. Thus didst Thou scape into thy long wishd Nest Of a devout and solitarie Rest. Thy Soule unhamperd &amp; set free From thy incumbring Dignitie Finds ample space Of Time &amp; Place To sit &amp; sing Of every thing, Which tossd &amp; troubled her before The Tempest cast her on this shore. For from thy Cradle takes thy Muse her Rise And to this Days Exploit unwearied flies. The Evening of Thy Life Thou solacest With her sweet Lay's to bring thy Soule to rest In softest Peace, &amp; to prepare It for the heavnly Consort, where A Part must be Chanted by Thee In that high Song, Which lasts as long As thy sublimest Wish: No feare That Discord shall affront Thee there To vex thy peacefull Heart, &amp; make Thee throw Thy Honour off, as Thou didst heer below. S. Joseph Forgive this Wrong, brave Soule, that other Toungs Have with thine holy Glories swelld their Songs, Whilst ours was grown too proud to sing An handicraft &amp; simple Thing. Loe here a Muse, as poore and plaine as Thou Thy selfe didst seem, offers her humble vow. Her vow to teach our English how to frame Its homage to thy long-forgotten Name, That now no talking Traveller May tell for News that He did heare In Spain &amp; France how JOSEPH us'd to goe For current Saint; In England Thou art so. Illustrious Saint, who mak'st thy Royall Line In Povertie with richer Glories shine The when upon its WISEST HEAD The fairest Crowne of ISRAEL stood, He by his numerous Wives his honour stain'd, Thou by thy ONE thy dignitie hast gain'd. What though seven hundred Beauties of y? East, All sprung from Royall Stocks, themselves did cast Into his lustfull Bed? Yet still More Glory in thy Spouse does dwell; Seven hundred Princesses lesse beauteous be Then One the Sole Queen of VIRGINITIE. Great Pharaoh's Daughter though her face &amp; ey Convey'd all Egypts lovely Majestie Into Judea, did not bring Halfe so delicious a Thing As thy Sweet Spouse shall carry back, when Shee Ev'n in her meanest State shall hither flee. That SONG OF SONGS, in w?? th' inspired King Rapt far above his owne Loves, strove to sing Of a Diviner Spouse, for whom All Heavn a Wooer would become, Paints out that Maries Prayses, w?? to Thee In purest Wedlock now must joyned be. Angells themselves in marriage thus may give In Conjugall Virginitie to live: For thats the wondrous Life w?? Thou Will with this Angell lead below; And grown all Spirit antidate by this Celestiall Life, the futures Virgin Bliss. But Jealousy steps in a while, &amp; tries Thy righteous tender Soule to exercise: Thy Spouse, whom Thou presumedst to be Thy Sister in Virginitie, Proves big with Child; O what shall Joseph doe Whose most afflicted Soule's as big with woe. He cannot Mary hate, nor her expose A publik scorne to her insulting Foes; But being just, He needs must part With Her once dearer then his Heart. Yet will in privite Her Divorce, that Shee Her &amp; her fault might shroud in Secresie. Thus drownd in Tears &amp; Thoughts a gentle sleep Upon thy heavy brow began to creep: When kind &amp; carefull Heavn did send Unto thy Soule thy Winged Friend; Sweet was his face, Joy smile'd in both his eyes Which with his Tongue he bad in thine arise. Feare not, said He, Good Joseph, Davids Son, Feare not to let thy Nuptialls goe on: How can thy Maries Wombe not be Big, which containes Divinitie? God's breeding there: Heavns Spirit w?? doth give Life ev'n to Life it selfe, made Her conceive. But I must tell Thee so: for humble Shee Will not y? Trump to her owne honour be, But rather chuse that all this while False Jealousie should Thee beguile, And staine her Credit, then her Tongue should tell That God vouchsafes within her Wombe to dwell. For Him thy Mary shall bring forth; &amp; Thou His Name must JESUS call, from whom shall flow A sure &amp; generall Salvation To every beleeving Nation. This said, the Angell vanishd; after Him The Sleep took Wing, &amp; so brake up y? Dream. Thou wakened thus, &amp; knowing well that thy Owne Guardian Angell used no forgery, With faithfull trembling joy unto Thy pregnant Virgin Spouse dost goe, And her, thy gentle Judge, for pardon pray Whom jealous Thou hadst wronged yesterday. O with what reverend Love &amp; Care dost Thou Attend on Her, whom Thou beleevest now To be Gods Spouse as well as thine And far lesse humane then Divine! And with what earnest strife doth lowly Shee Beat back those dutifull Respects to Thee! But Caesars Edict to y? tax doth call. Thou must in haste to Bethlem, Spouse &amp; all, To that proud Towne, w?? yeilds no room When Povertie a guest doth come, But some discourteous Cave: Thus scorned Thou Who many a house hath built, doth want one now. But He built many more, who by &amp; by Will bless his World with His Nativitie Ev'n in this Place, which howsoe'r Contemptible it doth appeare, Shall outshine Heavn; such power hath Christmas Day; Nor can proud Heretiks vote it away. Joy, Noble Saint, th' Eternall Father heere Hath given Thee leave his dearest Name to wear; Thou too shalt Father called be Of his great Son, who now to Thee Committed is. Was ever Trust so large! God, and Gods Mother are left to thy charge. And soone Thou shalt have work, for Herods wrath Through thousands Infants Breasts decreed hath To dig its way to JESU'S Heart. Thou from thy Country must depart, No longer Bethlem, but design'd to be (So Hell &amp; Herod vote) A Butcherie. Thou must depart: thy privy Counsellor, Thy Angell tells Thee so. Flie with thy dear Charge into Egypt, flie, says He: O that these wings of mine might be Their Chariot! But this noble favour must Be thine, whom Heavn has honourd w?? this Trust. Great was thy haste, as was thy Love: e'r Night Was fled before y? face of dawning Light, From Bethlem Thou hadst borne away The better &amp; the purer Day: The Noble Names-sake journying heertofore Much lesse Salvation into Egypt bore. With what observance didst Thou forward goe Both to the Son, &amp; to the Mother too, What fear, lest thine owne loving breast In His, or Hers should be distrest, What tenderness to keep the Mother warme, What daintie Care that God should take no harme! In Egypt Thou keptst house awhile with thy Although but small, yet heavnly familie, Untill thine Angell thither came And counsells Thee to travell home. Herod was dead, &amp; now y? Jews will give JESUS, their owne lives fountaine, leave to live. O blessed Saint, what glorious Conversation Hadst Thou in that great Infants education, Who, though the King of Majestie Deignd to be Subject unto Thee. Unto astonishment I must submit When I revolve thy Life in Nazaret. Surely the Heavnly Quire would gladly come To make in thy poore House their nobler Home, And finde their Service full as high In thy sublime Oeconomie: Finding no cause for Angels now to scorne The Carpenters Apprentices to turne. Heer might they see their Makers blessed eyes, Which when He was at home with them surprize With Light intolerable: heer With safe accesse they might draw neer His simple Cradle, whose illustrious Throne Above, they found too bright to look upon. But how at length, Deare Saint, how couldst Thou dy, When Life it selfe dwelt in thy Family? Gave JESUS leave to Love &amp; Joy Thy overcharged Heart to slay? Lest if Thou still shouldst live His Death to see, That One might thousand others heap on Thee. Goe then, Sweet Soule, in peace &amp; stand a while Behinde the Curtaine, till thy Lord fulfill His Tragedie: Then shalt Thou be Restored to His dear Companie, And wait upon Him in His glorious Way Unto His Throne upon Ascension Day. Natalitium: Martj 13, 1645 1 Tire'd with my PSYCHE, (for y? Song Though wondrous hudled, yet was long, And near A year Consumed in such singing, well may force A stronger Voice then mine, &amp; make it hoarse.) 2 I took some time to breath, but strait Curs'd LAZINES which lay in wait, Did heap Its sleep Upon my Heart, &amp; I grew well content With Ease, ev'n in the midst of active Lent. 3 Lent, &amp; y? Spring, &amp; my great Need Of being Buisie could not breed Desires Brisk fires, No, nor y? Spark of any Thought w?? might Me in y? ways of good Imployment light: 4 Till rows'd by this important Day I started up, &amp; wip'd away The Mist Which prest Upon mine Eys; &amp; now I am awake: But whoe will say so else that hears me speak! 1 Can any Charitie beleve That I a fiction doe not weave, When I shall talk How I have heer In this Lifes Walk Gone Thirtie Year And yet can nothing shew wherby This Course of mine it self may justifie, Unless I use the trick of Travellers, to Lie? 2 He whoe would paint my Life aright Has nothing but a Blank to write; Pure Vanitie Its Arms doth reach About all my Fond Life; where such A plenitude of Emptines In all its annuall Circles bubling is That thirtie Cyphers may my Thirtie years express. 3 The more my Shame, You'l say: &amp; so All blushing guilty I say too. I shall be yet More vain, yf I Did not admit That Vanitie Which everie Ey that reads but Me Doth in that prospect so compleatly see, That 'tis too late to crave Help of Hypocrisie! 4 'Tis true, our Nations sinfull Score From patient Heavn hath Vengance bore: Love, Peace, &amp; Law, Obedience, Right, And Safetie, now Have taken flight, E'r since our woefull Isle began Within it self to raise an Ocean, And Tides of Blood about the desperate Country ran. 5 'Tis true, my Self have felt some share Of headlong &amp; injurious Warr: But had my Hart Been brave &amp; right, Surely my Part Had not been sleight; But with those faithfull Hero's whoe Impatient gallantrie bid battell to All Persecution, I had had the grace to goe. 6 They, noble Soules, long time before Layd up substantiall Virtue's store, But heedless I Had not the Witt Of Gallantrie That Stock to gett: Fond Drone, I playd &amp; wantonized Untill my sunshine Summer was surprized With Winter, which all Heavn with clowds &amp; storms disguized. 7 And now, alas, what can I doe But sitt, &amp; think, &amp; sing my Woe! I might have been All pure &amp; white, As was this clean Leaf where I write, But now am farr more spotted, then Is this unhappie virgin Papyr when Deflour'd &amp; stained thus, by my adulterate Pen. 8 Yet I can sigh, &amp; wish for Tears To wash my Thirtie blotted years. And whoe can say But languishment And longing may Make Heavn relent! Whoe knows but Jesus will supplie What wants both in my hardned Hart, &amp; Ey Out of his own deep Wounds, the Springs w?? ne'r are drie? 9 This is my Hope: else would I not To Live, on any terms be got. Life is a thing Which doth belie Its Name, &amp; cling With flatterie About the Hart it means to slay, Yf JESUS helpeth not to purge away The Poison w?? amidst its smiling Looks does play. 10 O onely LORD OF LIFE &amp; LOVE, Those pretious Names upon Me prove! I am thy DUST And ASHES, and My onely trust On Thee doth stand: Since Thou art pleased to repreive Me still, oh crown the Favour Thou dost give, And to thy Mercie's Praise &amp; Honor let Me live. 11 I care not what becomes of Me In this our Warrs Calamitie: I care not though All Mischeifs bend At Me their Bowe, And everie Friend Turns Stranger unto my Distress, So long as I Thy favour may possess, And duelie answer it with bounden Loyallness. 12 I feel Rebellious Seeds would fain Amidst my Hart spring up again, And taint this year As they have done All these which are Allready runn. Help, help, sweet JESU; rather I In any deadly Agonie would frie; Then, whilst in ease I live, of these soft Poisons die. Anniversarium Baptismi Martj. 21. 1 Woe is me, but even now Proud &amp; fond I studied how To erect some gallant Vow On this pretious Mornings Brow, Whoe to Heavn allready ow Whatsoe'r I can bestow. 2 From a Childe ingaged I Stand in all Obligements by Baptisme's sacred Bonds, which tie Me so strait, that should I die For my LORD, I still must crie Spare thy Debtors Povertie. 3 But how often have I broke That which then I undertook And my Masters Wrath awoke! Well may my Demerits look For his Judgements heavy stroke Whome so highly they provoke. 4 Clean He washd Me then, &amp; white, And with Graces Me bedight; Which his Favour to requite, I free promise made to fight (Helpd by his inspiring Might,) With all Those whoe Him despight. 5 Yet I foulie falsifie'd All my Vows, &amp; madly trie'd How to serve the Hostile Side: In which Service had I die'd, What had my rebellious Pride Gaind, but endless Torments Tide? 6 Would destroying Satan save Me? Would this fadeing World releive Me? Or could rotten Flesh repreive Me? And (which most of all doth greive Me) Could my wronged Lord forgive Me? Or his scorned Heavn receive Me? 7 O my Hart, what shall we doe! What, but with Confession to Mercie's blessed footstool goe? Mercie, is our Master, whoe Allways pittieth the Woe Of his meek repentant Foe. 8 Lend, sweet JESU, lend thine ear, Loe my Hart, &amp; I, am heer, No ambitious Vow to rear; But in guiltie woefull fear, To beseech Thee Us to spare Whoe our old ones down did bear. 9 Down We bore them all as We Able were; yet still they be Fixed sure above with Thee, Nor could all our Treacherie Break those Bonds &amp; sett Us free From our bounden Loyaltie. 10 Help Us then again to take Up the Yoak We strove to break. Light it is; Yet thy dear Sake It by farr will lighter make. Help Us, Lord, &amp; from our Back Let no force this Burden shake. 11 O these Worldly Vanities Whose heap'd Froth upon Us lies, Cheat our shoulders in that guise, And prove heavie Miseries: Yf thy Cross their place supplies, Sooner We to Heavn shall rise. A Friend 1 Dear Name, &amp; dearer Thing! to Thee How dull &amp; coarse all Jewells be! Though I to them can love maintain, Yet they can not love Me again; Cold stones are sparkling, They, But Thou of fire of Life dost make thy Ray. 2 The kindest Gemm w?? me can grace Must be beholden for a place Upon my open Ring or Breast, As being nothing yf supprest: But through &amp; through my Hart Thy hidden Riches Thou canst cleerly dart. 3 To sett Thee off there dost Thou finde A Foil, alas, more black &amp; blinde Then any Night which ever yet On back of pretious Stone was sett; And though Thou needst it not, Art riveted into an hideous Blott. 4 All other Blotts farr purer are Then Snow, yf they with sinn compare: But Thou art Neer as deerest Heavn By which Thou unto Earth art given. Thus other Gemms confess By their sweet Light, that Phebus them did dress. 5 O could our greedy World but read The value of a Friend indeed; No India's should be raked more, No Deeps imbowelled of their Store: All Voyages should be Made to no other Port but Amitie: 6 The onely Port where We can finde Safe harbour from that furious Winde Of treacherous Fortune; She whoe ranges About y? World with Storms of Changes, And with her sudden shocks Dashes Prosperitie upon Sorrows Rocks. 7 Why dost Thou goe y? way about Vain Man, to finde some Treasure out? 'Tis not at Cittie, nor at Court, At neighbour or at forrein Port, Where Thou canst surely finde Thy Hopes, though long &amp; strong, crownd to thy minde. 8 O take y? nearest Cutt; goe trade To gain a Friend, &amp; thou hast made A better merket farr then they Whoe make returns of glittering Clay, Which ever was &amp; must Be subject unto Envie, Theivs, &amp; Rust. 9 Hast Thou a Friend? oh hold him fast As thine own Soule, &amp; know thou hast A Prize, which, as most Kings desire, Few are so blest as to acquire. Greatnes may Flatterers gain, But Friends scorn to be drawn by such a Chain. 10 Hast thou a Friend? whate'r thou hast, Thou hast compleatly double: cast Up thy account no more for One, Thy scant Identitie is gone: Thou art thy Friend, &amp; He By mutuall Faith transanimates with Thee. 11 That life he leads in Thee, to Him More pretious then his own doth seem; His own he freely will resigne So he may still be sure of thine; Death onely makes him live When he, by dying, Life to Thee doth give. 12 Joys loose to Him their Name &amp; Taste But when with Him thy share Thou hast: Whenever Thou receiv'st a Wound, He feels as deep y? strokes rebound, And claimeth as his right The moietie of thy disastrous plight. 13 Though all y? World upon Thee frown, He counts Thee still no less his own: 'Tis not thy Fortune, though as high As is a Crowns brave Majestie, But 'tis thy self alone Which knitts him to thee in Loves Union. 14 Of Virtu's genuine Faithfullnes True Loves pure Cement tempered is; A Cement that disdains to feel Times teeth, which triumph over Steel, Or suffer any Harme From angrie Fortune's most outrageous Storm. 15 Parentall Kindenes cold may grow And Filial Dutie cease to glow; Ev'n Matrimoniall Fervour may Be chill &amp; faint &amp; die away; But Friendship's resolute Heat In Loyaltie's eternall Pulse doth beat. 16 Tell all things else by thy slight Eye Thou scornst their glozing Treacherie; But, next to thy Devotions, spend Thy holyest Powers upon thy Friend: None but thy God, &amp; He Inseparably linked are to Thee. Temporall Success 1 Foule beauteous Witch, whose painted face Inchanteth everie place, How many more Admirers wait on Thee Then upon Virtu's brave integritie! 2 Let adverse Fortunes but conspire And their shortwinded ire Blow upon noble Job, y? world will swear The Man's condemned, &amp; Gods breath blew there. 3 With Swains whoe nothing higher know Then the dull ground they plow, Ev'n Eliphaz, Bildad, Zophar, men of high And famous learning, own this Foolerie. 4 Befooled &amp; inchanted, They Conclude Job's Virtu's lay In's Children, Servants, Cattell; Thus, alas, Uncertain Goods for certain Goodnes pass. 5 The sage substantiall Jews were all Caught in this sottish Thrall, And those that sate in Moses's reverend Chair Amidst their Gravitie thus Childish were. 6 Yf they great JESUS nayled see To his tormenting Tree, His Case proclaims his equall guilt, say They, And strait they vote Him a meer Castaway. 7 Was flourishing Dives then (although His whole estate be now Not worth one Drop of Water,) so sublime A Saint, bycause in Fullnes He did swimm? 8 And was poor Lazarus a Wight Plung'd in a cursed plight, Bycause in's Flesh as rotten as in's Raggs, And dressed by no Surgeons but the Doggs? 9 Then, Holy Mahomet, say I, Blest in thy Heresie: Then the Odrysian Moons right heavnly Hornes The conquerd Crosses Arms most justly scorns. 10 Then at the Alcorans brave feet Our noble Gospell must submit; Then are the Turks Heavns Darlings, &amp; the Grand Seignor henceforth for Prince of Saints must stand. 11 Then is y? noble Gold a poor And contemtible Ore, Bycause it must be tri'd &amp; torturd by The Fornace's incensed Tyrannie. 12 But lazie Lead, or glaring Brass, Bycause they never pass The trying Rules of such Severitie, For best of Metalls must admitted be. 13 Then y? fair Roses blushing Hue Unto it self is due Being a wretched shamefull Shrub, bycause The persecuting horn her Body claws. 14 But Heavn &amp; Shame forbid, that They By such false weights should weigh Whose Master unto generous Virtue chains Ten thousand Persecutions &amp; Pains. 15 Those temporall Blessings He can well Betemm on Sonns of Hell; Blessings which never bless, but when they be Tam'd &amp; in order kept by Pietie. 16 But He with Diet course &amp; spare His Champions doth prepare, That sound &amp; hardie grown, they stoutlier may His battels fight, &amp; surer win the day. 17 That Day, whose Morning is not drest In our Aurora's east, But then shall spring, &amp; shine forever, when Phebus shall Fall no more to Rise agen. 18 Then, whatsoever Blessings were Bated to Virtue heer, JESUS shall with immortall Use repay; Nor will his Saints think much till then to stay. ? ????? ?? ????? ?? ?????? 1 Cor. 13. 5. 1 'Tis Yee, black Avarice, &amp; Hate, Whose fell conjunction begat Those costly Barrs And wrangling Warrs Which shed the hartblood of ten thousand Purses Draind into Lawyers Chests with full as many Curses. 2 'Tis thou, incroaching Pride, whoe first Into thy Neighbours Bounds did burst; Thou, who dost by Extremitie Of Sin, excuse its Guilt, &amp; paint y? stories Of thy vast Murders with victorious Valours glories. 3 Love never any Soldiers prest Anothers Right away to wrest; And though it knows What Shafts &amp; Bows And Battells mean, all its Artillerie Weapons of Sweetnes &amp; Delicacie be. 4 Love never went to Law, nor knew What kinde of Trade it was to sue; Love never feed A Toung to plead, Nor hir'd y? Judges Conscience, so to make Justice hirself upon hir throne unjustly speak. 5 O no; Love nothing thinks so farr Its own, as either by the Warr Of Sword or Toung To right its wrong: And how much less will it a fight maintain To ravish Goods, &amp; others Propertie to gain? 6 Snatch but Loves Cloke, &amp; that will be A Pledge of further prey to thee; For Love will not Denie its Coat, Being ashamed more to force Thee to Restore its clothes, then naked up and down to goe. 7 No Action of Batterie fear Though Loves right Cheek you beat or tear; No; Love doth offer Its left to suffer, And by the glorie of like patience be Sister unto the Right, in milde humilitie. Humane Revenge 1 Where doth that Beutie &amp; that Sweetnes lie Whereby Thou charmest generous Spirits, whoe With might &amp; main thy busines do; Thy monstrous buisnes, which All other Witcheries doth farr outwitch. 2 Art Thou not stuffd with Bitterness and Gall? Is all Thy Trade not full of gnawing Passions, Of Discontents, &amp; self-vexations? Doth not the boiling heat Of thy fell Bosome, make thy self its meat? 3 O costly sin; what thanks to Heavn We ow, That Thou Inevitablie art accurst Thy self to feel thy furie first! Thus, in hir bringing forth, The Vigor's punishd for that hellish birth. 4 What Riddle's this, That Man should pleased be To see What Tempests He can raise, &amp; what Harme He to others can create! That He his Gains should cast Up by no Rule, but what his Neighbor lost! 5 The worst of Tigres never on his Prey Did lay His irefull Teeth &amp; Paws, that He Might onely read his Butcherie: 'Twas Hunger wrought the feat, And He did onelie Tear, that He might Eat. 6 But Thou, foule Hagg, canst doe no more then slay, Thy Prey: Thy Barbarisme can for its End Nothing but Barbarisme intend: For simple Mischeifs sake Thou allways thy mischeivous Pains dost take. 7 But stay thine hand, revengefull Gallant, stay, And say Whither thy Scores with God be clear; For yf th' ast any Recknings there, Learn to be kinde below, And unto Heavn that gentle Copie show. 8 Doe not by thy seveer Example force The Course Of heavnly Furie: doe not stop The golden gate of Mercie up. O doe not Thou deny Forgivenes, whoe without it needs must dy. 9 Trust God to vindicate thy Injurie, Since He Monopolizeth Vengance, and Ties it to His almighty Hand. Or yf thy Case Thou durst Not trust with Him, thy self how canst thou trust? Suspirium ad Amorem (For a Base &amp; a Treble.) O love Come prove Thy Dart On Me; And deigne To gaine My Hart To Thee! Thy Dart Can part A Breast Of Stone; O why Must my Resist Alone? The Flint That's in't Will rive When Thou Vouchaf'st A Shaft To give The Blow. 'Twill rive And live And show Some spark To light My Night Whoe now Am dark. Then I Shall spy The door And Way To Thee, And be No more Astray. The Sheepherd (Sett to 5 pts for voices &amp; violls . by . R. C.) 1 When great Love Did remove From above Heer to prove His delicious Art; He took A Crook And in's look Was as plain A Swain In grain, And did play his part With as harmlesse genuine Grace As Sheepherd e'r did trace Sichems feilds all flowrie face. 2 In a Meed Where no Weed E'r did breed, He did feed His unspotted sheep: No meat So sweet E'r did greet Lips which kisst The Nest Of best Dainties which did sleep On the bedds of Paradise So rich in sprightfull spice And inlivening Rareties. 3 For the Fare His sweet Care Did prepare, Was his dear And allpretious Flesh, Which He Made free Equalitie To each guest And drest The Feast In a mystik Dish: Thus his sheep to entertain, And their poor love to gain, He himself Heavns Lamb is slain. 4 He is slain And doth strain Might &amp; main Everie vein To yeild up each drop; Which flood Of Blood Might make good Heavn &amp; Bliss To dress Up his Lambs abundant Cup: All about whose noble Brimm Pure liquid Life doth swimm Sweetly to eternize Them. 5 Then to keep These his sheep Safe asleep From the deep Rage of Wolfe &amp; Bear, Each Hand Doth stand Open, and Feet &amp; Side Gape wide To hide All whoe nestle there: These five rubie folds alone Give safe protection To the Flocks that thither run. Hope 1 Yet still bear up: No Bark did e'r By stooping to the storm of fear Scape that Tempests Wrath which rent Two into one Element; Whilst in one Confusion The groaning Air, &amp; weeping Water run. 2 Bear up: &amp; those proud Waves w?? dash thee, Shall but onely fairer wash thee. Bear up; &amp; Thou at length shall fynd All these Blusterings are but Winde. Trust Hope, &amp; be Assur'd that She Will fynd thee out an hav'n amidst the Sea. 3 Suspect not any stoney Shelf; No Rock can splitt Thee, but thy Self. Hope casts hir Anchor upward, where No Storm durst ever domineer. Her Hand kinde Shee Holds out to Thee, To bid thee Wellcome to Securitie. 4 O then take her abord, although All other Wares Thou out dost throw; Thy Bark will onely lighter be By Hopes cheerly Companie; Though She doth farr Outweigh whate'r To stopp the Waves wide Mouth's thou threw'st in there. 5 Hope's Ey is fix'd upon a Starr Above the Polar fire as farr As Thou art sunk into Dismay: And She can thither steer thy Way, Whoe nobly by Her mystik Ey Is what She seeth, &amp; in Heavn doth ly. 6 Hope, though slow she be, &amp; late, Yet outrunns swift Time &amp; Fate; And aforehand loves to be With most remote Futuritie. Hope though She dies Immortal is And in fruitions fruit doth fairer rise. 7 Hope, is Comfort in Distress: Hope, is in Misfortune Bliss: Hope, in Sorrow is Delight: Hope, is Day in darkest Night. Nor wonder at This ridling Knot, For Hope, is every Thing which She is not. Idleness 1 O tedious Idleness How irksome is Thy foolish Nothing! When all day I strugled through the craggiedst Way Of knottiest Learning to gett up To the fair top Of some deer Knowledge, I did never fynd My Body half so tir'd, so damp'd my Mynd. 2 So tir'd, &amp; damp'd as now: For monstrous Thou Thwart'st ev'n my Essence, &amp; dost choke My sprightfull Flame in drowsy smoke. Surely a Soule which dwells among A quick &amp; strong Consort of Organs, ne'r was seated there To lend to Sloths dull Pipe her active Ear. 3 Were I to Curse my Foe, I'd damne Him to No Hell but Thee; in whose blinde grott He, though in health, might lie &amp; rott, And prove Deaths wretched Sacrifice Before he dies; Whilst He himself doth to Himself become Both y? dead Carcase, &amp; the living Tombe. 4 May some Work ever keep Mine Eyes from Sleep Whilst they are wakeing! though it be But some poor Song to throw at Thee Mischeivous Sloth. Alas, I grutch That I so much Of this my little Time expend, whilst I All night seald up in lazie Slumbres lie. 5 The longest Summer Day Strait posts away. An honestly imployed Mynd Doth shriveld-up December fynd In wide-spred June; &amp; thinks black Night Crowds out fair Light As soon when Sol through lofty Cancer rides, As when down to the Fishes depth he slides. The Complaint Mighty Love, oh how dost Thou By not fighting, overthrow; Come, whilst Thou away art flying; Grant Petitions, by Denying; Burn Us, whilst Thou letst Us freize In our dull Aridities; Wound, yet never shoot a dart At the wounded bleeding Hart! For thy Wound I reigning finde In my sauciated Minde, Which is pierced deep by Thee 'Cause Thou hast not pierced Me. 'Cause my stony Hart I feel By thy Powers unwounded still. Woe is me whoe thus must by Want of Wounds, allwounded dy! Dy I must, yf thus I live; Life to Me no Life can give; Wounds &amp; Death bought Life for Me, Wounds &amp; Death my life must be: Wounds of present Love; not such As pierce deep, but never touch Death which liveth in Loves Darts, Into Life to murder Harts; Wounds, &amp; Death, which never from Absence's cold spring did come. Gentle Love, oh neerer still, Neerer yet, that I may feel What thou art, by feeling Thee; Not by Contrarietie. Sure ten thousand Worlds could not Hire me from thy love: yet what Is this Glowing, but Desire? Which falls short of generous Fire: Thy dear Fire, which might to Thee Make an Holocaust of Me! The Wound 1 Dear Love, thou needst not send a Dart To finde the bottome of my Hart: Tis found allready by that Spear Whose barbarous Point thine own did tear. It tore ope thine; And therefore mine, In which Thou, since Thou mad'st &amp; bought'st it, by That double Title hast more right then I. 2 To thy Hearts woefull Outcry, my Wounds gapeing Mouth makes its reply: Thy Clamor streameth in a flood Of rueful Water &amp; of Blood; And much like this My answer is; For through mine Eys the dutefull Waters gush, The burning Blood flows in my guilty Blush. 3 My guilty Blush; for I am He Who helpd to thrust that Spear at Thee: I helpd to thrust it, &amp; the Blow Upon my Self reboundeth now. Yet must I joy In this Annoy; For though thy Death be proved by that Wound, Thy Life is ratified by the Rebound. The Cheat 1 Sweet Beguilings, Cruel Smileings, Tickling Soules to death; Tedious Leisures, Bitter Pleasures, Smooth yet cragged Path; 2 Heavy lightnes, Whose sad Sleightnes Cheers, yet breaks the Bearer; Dainty Treasons Whose quaint Reasons Teach yet fool the Hearer: 3 Glorious Troubles, Mighty Bubbles, Horror fairly brimmed, Bane in Honey, Brass in Money, Nothing neatly timmed: 4 Are the Prizes Life devizes To warm fond Desires; Which by growing Hot, are blowing Their own funeral Fires. The Combat [[1. PART]] Love, though thou great &amp; dreadfull art, With Boldnes Thou hast fir'd my Hart, Which trembles not to aim at Thee Ev'n with that Dart Thou shott'st at Me: Twas Love Thou shott'st; &amp; that art Thou; And at thy Self thy Self I throw. I throw thy Self; but loe my Hart Still sticking is upon thy Dart. 2. PART And dost Thou shoot, dear LORD, again At him whome Thou before hadst slain? This Deaths Life kills me so, that I Must shoot again, or else I dy. I dy, unless I live to see This Hart &amp; Life quite lost in Thee. Fair is my Aim, &amp; high my Trust; Thy Side's wide ope, &amp; shoot I must. Lo: Bid it welcome unto Thine, Else can my Hart no more be mine. The Pretence 1 Vain Hart, why wouldst Thou try The Bag of every Bee that buzzeth by? With any didst Thou ever meet Amidst whose Honey was not sett A Sting to warn thine Hand The Danger of Delight to understand? 2 Nay, leave thy Preaching: I Beleve that Pleasure Lawfull is, which thy Fond Tooth, desires to taste. But since The Lawfulnes is thy Pretence, Come, I will let Thee loose To Lawful things, where Thou mayst noblier choose. 3 First, know, tis Lawful to Abstein from that Thou pantest after so. 'Tis Lawful quite to quench the fire Of any secular Desire: Tis Lawful to refuse What Law itself alloweth Thee to use. 4 'Tis Lawful to deny Whate'r doth feuel to thy Flame supply. 'Tis Lawful to maintain a Warr Against thy Self, &amp; not to spare That Body, which unless Thou mortifie'st it, will thy Life suppress. 5 To Weep, to Fast, to Pray; To walk the hardy &amp; heroik Way Of Saints &amp; Martyrs, whoe in fear Of nothing more then Pleasures were; To bowe thy venturous back And any Cross on thy brave Shoulders take; 6 By his deer Blood to trace The gallant Footstepps of thy Lord; to Place Thy Self above thy Self, &amp; live In Lifes own Fount, whil'st Thou dost give All thy Desires to His Incomparable Will in Sacrifice. 7 All these are Lawful; and Much more then so.—Why dost Thou trembling stand? That Tremor shakes off from thy face The Mask in which it sheltred was; And makes Thee now confess Thou fearest thine own Weapon, LAWFULNES. The Pilgrim 1 Thanks, still encreasing Turmoils; I Mistook you heertofore: But now I learn no more To chide with that Uncertainty Which hunts Me out in every Place, &amp; tosses My settling Hopes through new disturbances &amp; crosses. 2 I am content Life should with me Not play the Hypocrite By Baits of vain Delight And treacherous Stabilitie. Since all the Heavns are restless, why should I Desire with sordid Earth, in Quiet heer to ly? 3 Had I a fixed Home below, That stiff Temptation might My foolish Hart invite To hanker heer, &amp; study how To plant my Self right deep &amp; sure; whoe must Whither I will or no, alas, fall into Dust. 4 What though my Books &amp; I be parted? I know all Freinds at last The parting Cup must taste. And now to me the World's converted Into one Library where I may read The mighty Leavs of Providence wide open spred. 5 Terrestrial Quiet I shall have More then enough, when I Sure &amp; fast sealed ly In my deep silent Grave: Why should I plott &amp; project how to be Aforehand buried in earthly Securitie? 6 Why should I wish to be at home, So long as I'm abroad? For what's Life but the Road By journying through which We come Unto our Fathers house: &amp; happy We, Yf after all this journe We at home may be! 7 The Birds have Nests, the Foxes holes, But Heavns great Sonn had neither: And, tell me, hadst thou rather Live like the Foxes, &amp; the Foules, Then like thy God; espetialy when He By's Providence to this brave Hardship lureth Thee. 8 Born in a borrowd house, &amp; in A borrowd Cave interred, He first &amp; last preferred What lazie Flesh &amp; Blood doth shunn: He might have for his Palace heer had room, But scorned any Place but Heavn, to own for Home. 9 Blow then the worst of Blasts, &amp; beat My Bark about the World; Still can I not be hurld Beyond ken of my Hav'n, nor meet One Place more distant then another, from The heavnly Port, to which alone I pant to come. 10 I pant to come; for what, what am I but a Stranger heer As all my Fathers were? Nor would I stay to learn &amp; frame My Toung or Manners to this Countries guise, Which ne'r will suit with what's in fashion in the Skies. 11 But yf I must be thrown into Some seeming fixed Seat; So may I dwell in it, That it ne'r dwells in Me! O no; I rather heer would no Possessions have, Then be Possest by what I needs at length must leave. ?????????? 1 O vile ingratefull Me, That I should Live, &amp; not in Thee! Not to thy Praise, from whome All this my Life doth come! What Riddle's this, that I should strive Onely against my Life to Live! 2 Against Thee, gentle LOVE, Life of my Life, long have I strove, Still misusing Thy sweet Grace, Still refusing To give place To mine own Bliss, which Thou with thy Milde Yoke about my neck wouldst ty. 3 And thus, alas I have All this wide World but for my grave; Where the Stone Which doth ly Heavy on Me and my Earth-hamperd Thoughts, is onely this Unhappy Hearts Obdurateness. The Crie 1 Speak, everlasting WORD, oh speak, That I may break These Bonds of Death, &amp; by My Resurrection make Reply. 2 Thy potent Voice wak'd that vast Deep Which lay asleep In deadly Darknes, and Rowz'd a World by its stout Command. 3 Thy Prophet Thou didst summon from His living Tombe, Where twice-devoured He Lay drownd both in the Whale, &amp; Sea. 4 What though this Death wherein poor I Deep-plunged ly, Be more profound then all The Sea, more monstrous then the Whale? 5 What though the Worlds dark Wombe was not So foule a Grott As this in which I grope? Yet I am still in ken of Hope. 6 The deepest Deeps are shallow found When Thou dost sound: And I shall Rise, deer LORD, Yf Thou but soundst with thy sweet Word. Whiteness, or Chastitie Set to 4 pts. by T. T. Tell me, where doth Whiteness grow, Not on Bedds of Scythian Snow; Nor on Alabaster Hills; Nor in Canaans milkie Rills; Nor the dainty living Land Of a young Queen's Breast or Hand; Nor on Cygnets lovely necks; Nor in Lap of Virgin Wax; Nor upon the soft &amp; sleek Pillows of the Lillies Cheek; Nor the pretious smileing Heirs Of the Mornings Perlie tears; Nor the silver-shaming Grace Of the Moons unclowded Face: No; All these Candors Are but the handsome Slanders Cast on the Name of genuine WHITENES, which Doth Thee alone, fair CHASTITIE, inrich. A Morning Hymn What's this Morns bright Eye to Me, Yf I see not thine, &amp; Thee, Fairer JESU; in whose Face All my Heavn is spred! Alas Still I grovel in dead Night, Whilst I want thy living Light; Still I sleep, although I wake, And in this vain Sleep I Talk, Dreaming with wide open eyes, Fond fantastik Vanities. Shine, my onely Daystarr, shine: So mine Eyes shall wake by Thine; So the Dreams I grope in now To clear Visions shall grow; So my Day shall measured be By thy Graces Claritie; So shall I discern the Path Thy sweet Law prescribed hath; For thy Wayes cannot be shown By any Light, but by thine own. An Evening Hymn Never yet could careless Sleep On LOVES watchfull Eylid creep; Never yet could gloomy Night Damp his Ey's immortal Light: LOVE is his own Day, &amp; sees Whatsoe'r himself doth please. LOVE his piercing Look can dart Through the Shades of my dark Heart, And read plainer farr then I All the Spotts which there do lie. Pardon then what Thou dost see, Mighty LOVE, in wretched Me. Let the sweet Wrath of thy Ray Chide my sinfull Night to Day; To the blessed Day of Grace Whose deer East smiles in thy Face. So no Powers of Darknes shall In this Night my Soule appall; So shall I the soundlier Sleep, Cause my Heart awake I keep, Meekly waiting upon Thee, Whilst Thou deignst to watch for Me. Hymnus ad Christum, proxime cooptandi in S. Presbyteratus Ordinem 1 Sweet love, loe at thy gentle Feet My trembling Soule I throw; Which doth full sadly know How great The Sanctitie of this high Function is, And how extreem my own unworthynes. 2 Were my foule Spotts clean washed out; Were I refin'd, till I Could with pure Seraphs vie In stout And genuine Rays; still must my Heart complain 'Twere too impure this Office to sustein. 3 This Office, which with Clay &amp; Dust Doth Heavn it self, &amp; more, Thee, whom all Heavns adore, Intrust. How, how shall most polluted I endure The mighty burden of a Charge so pure! 4 But though I durst not shutt mine ear Against this Call, which from Thy Self doth seem to come; Yet fear Of mine own Vilenes, &amp; of glorious Thee, Spurrs to this bold Request all-quaking Me: 5 Yf Thou foreseest that I shall not Advance thine Honor by My climbing up so high; O putt Some Barr between, yea though't be Death, that so I may not Rise to mine own Overthrow. Paulo post Ordinationem 1 Since then Thou pleased art, deer Lord, To afford To most unworthy ME This sacred Dignitie; In endless Thanks to Thee, oh may That Goodnes force my Heart it self to pay. 2 When to thy dreadfull Altar I Shall draw nigh To wait on Thee, &amp; thence Loves wonders to dispense; Forgive my Sinns, &amp; teach me how To raise my thoughts above all things below. 3 When I thy Lambs to pasture lead; Let me feed Their pretious Soules with sweet And holy wholesome Meat. But cheifly let my Pattern teach Them, what my Toung shall else but faintly preach. 4 When I that Balm to Soules shall deal Which to heal Meek wounded Bosomes, Thou Leftst with thy Church below; O guide my Hand with holy Skill, Least rash in others cures, my self I kill. 5 When Life, or Death, when Honors, Pleasures, Times, &amp; Treasures, Shall tempt me to betray My Functions duty, may Thy Grace my Buckler be, &amp; so No Powers thy feeble Priest shall overthrow. Febr. 27. Natalitium Martj. 13. 1647. 1 Heavn bless mine Eys! What do I see Behinde me there? And can this be A Life! &amp; Mine! where every Year Is but a Circle fraught With nought But frothie Emptines, or what Is vainer farr then that, Earth-groveling Thoughts, fond Wishes, foolish Fears, Foule Sloth, proud Wilfulnes, distrustfull Cares. 2 And what's that sweet &amp; pretious Band Of heavnly Things Which by it stand? What's He who spreads his ready Wings A downie Shield to be For Me And my unworthy Life? Alas Those are the Powers of Grace; And this, my everwatchful Guardian, whoe Strove, not to let me mine own Self undoe. 3 O me! their blessed Sight confounds My guilty breast, Bycause those Wounds Of Love &amp; Life I did resist By which sweetcruel They To slay That sinful Death did strongly strive Which in my Soule did live. And now the sweeter are their Looks, the more Floods of Dismay upon my Heart they poure. 4 And have I liv'd for this, that I At length should be Frighted with my Own Life's strange Looks! O pittie Me All yee who ever felt What Guilt Can do, when all its hideous Dread In stern array is spred Before a trembling Soule, which doth perceive How all her Life long She did never Live. 5 How shall I do to look i' th' face This dawning Year, Who careless was Of those in which Heavns Love did spare My dareing Impudence. O whence Shall I snatch Comfort, who so long On Patience heaped wrong! On thy deer Patience, JESU, which hath fought With all the Sinns vile I against it brought. 6 Whence, but from Thee, sweet King of Grace Who never yet Hid'st thy milde Face From any which Thou sawest wett With penitent floods? Yf Thou Wilt now But with thy Beams of Mercie shine On this dead Heart of mine, With holy Vigour 'twill at length revive, And I again, this year at least, shall live. 7 O give Me leave to think, that thy Blest Will alone Did dignify Me with that mighty Function In which Thou didst instate Of late Thy worthless Worm: And shall thy Priest Go Sacrifice the rest Of his (how pretious) Time at any shrine, O most deserving JESU, but at thine? 8 Forbid it most almighty Lord, Upon whose great Authentik Word All Wonders give attendance! Let Me either live to Thee; Or see No more unprofitable days: For what, what have the ways And works of Darknes, &amp; infernal Night To do with pure &amp; sin-upbrayding Light? Anniversarium Baptismi Martj. 21, —47. 1 Still, still deer LOVE, must I In spight of HERESY, My thanks on this Days Altar heap; Thy Goodnes still I must adore, Which washd a poor And sin-besmeard Thing, in that deep And spotless Fount of Purity Which thy Compassion broachd to clense that fatal Stain Which from old Adam, o'r all Soules did reign. 2 Let cruel Hearts deny Thy mighty Courtesy To infant Soules, &amp; boldly plead That Baptisms due to none but those Whome Years dispose Unto thy Faith to bowe their head: Let sacrilegious Impudence Go rinse And wash away that blessed Washing Thou Didst on thy tender newborn Lambs bestow. 3 It is enough, (&amp; more;) Sweet Lord, that I, before I could desire that Boon of Thee, Was in Lifes blessed Fountain drownd; Which cur'd my Wound Before I felt my Miserie. Ne'r will I wrong thy Goodnes so As to Suspect the Soundnes of that Cure which from The mighty Saviour of the World did come. 4 But a new wound doth slay My guilty Heart to Day, Whilst Recollection tells me how I have by many a Sinn in grain Distained again That Soule which most propitious Thou Wert pleasd at first to wash so white, And bright. O me! my inward Blotts now damp that Grace And Joy, w?? else would gild this Mornings face. 5 Had not thy Hands, &amp; Side, And Feet, sett open wide Another Flood; my squalid Soule Would prove fitt fuel for those Flames Whose burning Streams With everlasting Sulphure roll Into that purple Sea of thine, Let mine Afflicted Vessel launch, that I may scape The most irreparable Wracks Mishapp. 6 O make my Heart disdain Henceforth to entertain The least of Thoughts, which may invite Me to dissolve that Faith which I To Thee &amp; thy Pure Service, on this Day did plight. What is this Worlds brave Vanitie To Me; What are the Devils, &amp; the Fleshe's Charms? Since I am thrown into thy nobler Arms. 7 Thine &amp; thy Churche's Arms: O blessed Nest! No Harms Can reache Me there, unless I be Conspirator with them, &amp; fight Against that Might Which Thou afford'st to shelter Me. JESU, forbid it then, that I Should by Selftreachery be slain, &amp; onely live An endless Life unto my Death to give. Submission 1 Oft has my prostrate Soule to Thee Great Lord of Love, commended this DESIGNE Whose restless importunitie Burns in this Heart of mine: And at thy gracious Feet full low It &amp; my Self, again I throw. 2 Thou se'st how many pretious Houres Of my short Time it spends: Thou seest how It reigns in all my Thoughts, &amp; pours Storms of Disquiet through My deerest Meditations, which Fain at thy Heavn &amp; Thee would reach. 3 Most bitter-sweet DESIGNE which hants My Bosome with such Tyrannous Delight, That though my Hearts Indeavour pants To flie this tedious Night Of gloomy &amp; uncertain Hope, Still in these doubtfull Mists I grope. 4 Oft have I thought, that I had drawn Neer unto Quiets blessed Shore; but strait By flattering Fancy I was thrown Into some new Deceit: Still-joying to Sail in this Sea Which shipwrackd all my Joies, &amp; Me. 5 And thus deliciously perplext, Close in my Breast I huggd my sweet Distress; Which, though it always knawd &amp; vext With pleasing Restlesness, I durst not turn my Foe away Whoe me so daintily did slay. 6 My Wounds to any tender Ey I durst not shew, nor gain a Freinds releif: I durst not mine own Help supply To cure ev'n mine own Greif: I unwishd mine own Wishes, and With one beat down my other Hand. 7 A thousand times my Thoughts I chode, And then as oft those Chideings did recant: Against my Self I boldly stood, And when I firmly ment This Side should Victor be, the other Soon trampled down his dareing Brother. 8 Did any Riddle e'r present So valiant a Coward, as poor I; Who by the Wings of strange Consent Pursue ev'n what I fly: Whoe hate these anxious Thoughts, yet am So mad to Think none else but them. 9 O mighty LORD of GOODNES, my Most aenigmatik Greif appeals to Thee: Use, Use thine own Authority Both upon it, &amp; Me. No more will I own this DESIGNE Unless it may comply with Thine. 10 Pure Sweets dwell in thy Will alone, But mine, when sweetest, with rank Gall doth flow: O then, may Thine, may Thine be done, Though mine it overthrow! The onely way I have to quiet My troubled Will, is, to Deny it. A Preparatory Hymne to the Week of Meditacions upon, &amp; Devout Exercise in the Historie of Christ; composed for my Friend 1 No Days, nor Weeks, must I Account, but by The Revolutions of LOVE: LOVE is the Sunn Whose Flame alone In My Soules loyal Orb shall move. 2 Rebellious is each Houre Which doth not poure The homage of its highest Praise In a full Stream On LOVES dear Name; That Name, w?? Heavn with Bliss arrays. 3 LOVE is my King, &amp; I Hold onely by His Grace's royal Charter: He Right nobly gave Me all I have; And, what is more, gave Me to Me. 4 Me! What am I! vile I! LOVE scorneth by So poor a Gift, to bound his Grace: Himself on Me Illustrious He By his brave Self bestowed was. 5 And is not my poor Time All due to Him? To bounteous Him, who offers Me The soverain treasures, And boundless pleasures Of his supreem Eternitie? 6 Due, more then due it is: And I by his Exploits of Grace henceforth will raise My Soule to frame A better Name For all my consecrated Days. 7 No other Gods I'l seek To fill my Week: LOVE, nothing else but LOVE alone. Is of extent Sufficient To swell my Weeks dimension. 8 From Morn to Evening I The History Of LOVE through all my houres will spread; That I may prove My Trade is LOVE, With LOVE I'l Rise, &amp; Goe to bed. 9 From LOVE's poor Cratch, my Race I'l gin, &amp; trace His noble Acts, untill I see Him mounted on His erned Throne Of Glorie's bright Sublimitie. 10 And when I thus have brought My Week about; I'l to his Cratch again, &amp; move With restless Rest From East to West In none but in the Sphear of LOVE. 11 So I in Him, &amp; He Deliciouslie Shall move in Me: So shall not I, Though heer I breathe On Earth beneath, Think Heavn above my head doth ly. A Conclusorie Hymne to the same Week; &amp; for my friend 1 Thus, thus my Soule perceiveth now To what my longest Days I ow; And I recant the Praises I Have often tun'd so high To goodly June's most florid Powers, And lofty Cancers sixteen golden Houres. 2 It is not June, nor Cancer which The Ev'n so farr from Morn doth stretch, Charming Heavns Flame to loyter heer About our hemisphear. O no! the courteous summer Sun Which gives the Days true length is LOVE alone. 3 Witness this blessed Week, which, though The Days now shrinck &amp; shorter grow, Disdaineth to be measured by That Moneth or Year, which I Spun out before, &amp;, having done, Found my vain Thred was into Nothing run. 4 The further Vanitie doth spread, The less, &amp; shorter is its Thred; And Emptines, the more it grows, Onely the more doth loose. Such were my Moneths &amp; Years, till I Began to trade in LOVES deer History. 5 But now my Days so long appear, That in each Week, I live a Year: My better Years I reckon by LOVES Motions; &amp; I Have found a way each Week to run Through the whole Circle of my deerest SUN. 6 And yet that dainty Bliss, by which My Days to such sweet lengths do stretch; So strangely shrinks them up again, That in the shriveld reign Of Capricorn, clung Winter is Pent up in Days less scant &amp; short than these: 7 Than these, these Summer Days of mine; In which now LOVE alone doth shine, His mighty Beam's delicious Tide Pours out it self so wide, That every Day would take its flight To bed too soon, though 'twere an Age to Night. 8 For, what's an Age to those deer Sweets Whose boundless Ocean duely meets My Meditations, whersoe'r My Soule her bark doth steer? That bark, which though for evermore It sails, yet cannot reach this Oceans shore. 9 My Days look but like Minutes now, My Houres like wretched Nothings show: Whilst yet me thinks I but Begin The Evening rusheth in; And over all the world 'tis night Whilst in my Soule 'tis yet but New daylight. 10 This is LOVES sweet &amp; heavnly sport, To make my Days so long, &amp; short; That so they may a Shaddow be Of his Eternitie, Which, though beyond all Time it swell, Yet is an Instant its best Parallel. 11 And straitned in this Vastnes may I ever be! Let every Day Less than a Minute seem; yet such As no Age can outreach: Whilst my Devotions sweetly rove In this deer Riddle of divinest LOVE. 12 For, what's this empty World to Me, Who finde no Fullnes, butt in Thee? In Thee, great LOVE, who onely art The Soverain of my Heart: My Heart, which Thou so strongly by Thy Sweetnes fir'st, that it must LOVE, or dy. Content Philip. 4. 11. 1 Divine Content! O could the World resent How much of Bliss doth lie Wrapp'd up in thy Delicious Name; &amp; at How low a Rate Thou mightst be bought; No Trade would driven be To purchase any Welth, but onely Thee. 2 Thee, pretious Thee, Who canst make Povertie As rich as th' Eastern Shore, Or Western Ore; And furnish Job a Seat More fair &amp; sweet Upon the Dunghill, than the glistering Throne Of Glories Darling, pompous Solomon. 3 For He, in all The whole Worlds mighty Ball, Which up &amp; down he tost In's thoughtfull breast, No solid Sport could finde To pay his Minde For his deep studious Pains; being flouted by Th' affronts of spirit-vexing Vanity. 4 But noble Job, (Though clad in Torments roab, And sadly seated on Shame's wretched Throne; Having no Sceptre, but A Potsherd put Into his woefull Hand, with which he reigns O'r nought but his rebellious Boils &amp; Pains;) 5 Is pleasd so well, That he his mouth can fill With Blessing &amp; with Praise Of Him who lays That mighty load of crosses And matchless Losses Upon his naked back; &amp; doth persist Ev'n still, the greatest Man of all the East. 6 And why may I Not valiantly defie The face of any Storm Mischance can arm Against my Bark? Why may I not obey HIS WILL, which, though a Flood of Gall it seems, Will by Submission, turn to Honey Streams? 7 What will it cost, When I by Storms am tost, Not, by repineing, to Augment my Woe? Let all the Windes worst Ire Proudly conspire; Yet, yf I durst but say, I AM CONTENT; Those Windes may whistle, for their furie's spent. 8 CONTENT's the Thing Which makes a Slave a King, Whilst in all fortunes, still He has his will: Nor do his Gives to him More heavy seem Bycause of Brass, than yf they were of Gold; For, his own Slavery he in chains doth hold. 9 CONTENT can laugh At all Mishapps, and scoff Ev'n Scoffings and Disgraces. CONTENT outfaces All Impudence, ev'n by Meek Modesty: And the Carreer of Opposition breaks Only bycause she no resistance makes. 10 CONTENT can be Full, &amp; good Companie In Solitude: CONTENT's Christmass in Lent; In Wracks &amp; Losses, Gain; Sunshine in Rain; A Cropp of Sonns &amp; Daughters springing from A single Bed, or Barrennesses Wombe. 11 CONTENT is Peace Amidst Warr's Miseries, CONTENT is Rest, although Sleep flies the brow. CONTENT, in Plunder's wealth, In Sicknes Health, Fruition in Hope, Plenty in Dearth, In Night Day, Life in Death, &amp; Heaven on Earth. 12 O deer CONTENT Thou onely Firmament Where Starrs can fixed shine; May I in thine Illustrious Orb, above All Motions Move! So shall my panting Heart, with restless Rest Wherever I am whirld about, be Blest. A Secret Sigh 1 Guilty, guilty, must I crie; Or give the Lie Both to my Self, &amp; Thee O LOVE, mine onely Deitie. Thou knowst how I the pretious Bargain stroke: But now my Vows, &amp; therefore I, am broke. 2 Vow'd I not, that this my Heart Should bear no part In any Joies, but them Which from thy Fount of Sweetnes stream? Yet has my foolish Soule been dabbling in The flattering Delicates of sugerd Brine. 3 For what else is this Delight Which day &amp; night Enchants my Thoughts to dance In a Vexatious-pleasing Trance About a Thing which must not, cannot, be; A Bratt of my fantastick Vanitie? 4 O I hate the Bratt, bycause My Love it draws To its unworthy Self; And on the lovely-hatefull Elf My Indignation could I freely poure, That Spight with genuine Love my heart would store. 5 Once again, deer LOVE, sett up My bankrupt Hope, And broken Heart: that I With dear &amp; sober ardency Unto my most inestimable Freind My wiser Flames may patiently extend. 6 Thee, who in that Freind of mine So full dost shine, May I gaze on alone With amorous intention: And not upon that fond &amp; worldly Paint My vain thoughts temper to adorn my Saint. 7 So my Vows shall stand, though I Still magnify That gentle pretious Soule, Letting my Meditations roule In that deer Sphear, where Thou thy Self great LOVE With such enamouring Grace art pleasd to move. The Relapse 1 Wert Thou not what Thou art, O Lord of most unbounded LOVE; This my rebellious Heart Durst never prove So bold as to implore Thy Pardon any more, Bycause my Boldnes hath so rampant been Against thy mighty Mercy to my Sinn. 2 For have not I again Resum'd that odious Vomit, which Of late I did disdain? Has not the Itch Of fond Imaginations, And fruitless Contemplations Spred its unquiet Taint's unhappy powers Over my calm &amp; consecrated houres? 3 Has not my foolish Minde Foulie misplac'd its Sorrow, and Been troubled more to finde Thine angry Hand Pouring out Vengeance; then To see my Flood of Sinn, Whose roaring Waves awak'd thy Wrath, which now In woefull Streams of Blood about doth flow. 4 Has not my lavish Breast Embrac'd my pretious Friend too close: The thoughts of whome possest Me so, that those Which I design'd to be Attending upon Thee Were often justled out, whilst thus my faint Devotions, from my God fell to my Saint. 5 O mighty Soverain Of Pittie, Loe my prostrate Heart Lies trembling once again Under thy Dart: Strike, strike, &amp; pierce it by LOVES healing cruelty; That by that blessed Wound my Soule may be Sett ope, &amp; bleed out every thing but Thee. Jealousy 1 Still, still I finde my Heart too much below: Which makes me tremble in sad fear That something heer Has stoln upon that heart, which now Pineing in strange Ariditie Forgets, deer LOVE, to pant, &amp; heave to Thee. 2 Do I not hate this World? Me thinks I do. For what has rotten Earth that can The Soule of Man With any lovely Motions woe? But in thy Heavn, &amp; fairer Thee, All glorious Attractions reigning be. 3 And yet I cannot trust this Heart, which hath So oft deceiv'd unhappy Me. To Thee, to Thee I fly, to shew me by what Path From my Soules Labyrinth I may Escape into thy fair Commandments Way 4 I care not though that Path be thick besett With Shame, &amp; Pain, &amp; Wrongs, &amp; Losses, And thousand Crosses; Things which will work me less regret, Than these importunate Thoughts which bait My restless Heart with fondly-sweet Deceit.

Martj. 13. 1648. 1 Whilst I behinde Me cast my annual Ey, What do I but my Sodome spy! O lamentable Sight Which justly might Not fix Me in a pile of Salt, But all my guilty Essence melt Into a Flood of Paenitence, whose Tide Might drown that which is gone, And let me safely on Its back unto the shore of this Year ride! 2 Alas! that I must these twelve Moneths discount, In which my Life did not amount To more than Death: For though I made a show Of breathing, &amp; still walkd about As yf in Lifes trade I had wrought; Yet, sure my Paths were but the ways of Sinn, I did but cheat my Breath, And wretchedly taught Death Its Victory before its time to win. 3 For is not now my Soule worse by a year Than 'twas before? Am I not heer Much further from my God, Than when I trode My two &amp; thirtieth Round? And by This distance of Impiety I grovel in a deadly Sink; For though Fond Men beleve where e'r They breathe, they Living are, Yet sure in Heavn alone true Life doth grow. 4 Those Judgements which now in our Island reign, Might well have weand me to abstein From the bewitching Breast Of Worldly Rest; And rather to Heavns Bottles send My hearts inflamed Thirst, than spend My pretious Time to suck that Milk which can Perhaps right-sweetly mock, Or delicately choke, But never nourish the faint Soule of Man. 5 Yet foolish I heer needs would linger still, To get of Emptines my fill: As yf Heavns Pleasure must On my vain Lust Have danc'd attendance; &amp; I might Heerafter time enough have light My lamp of Piety; yea though I knew Mortalities least blast Might Deaths sad curtains cast O'r my Lifes candle, e'r I older grew. 6 Alas, yf any Act appeard in Me Which might with credit owned be, I finde no ground to call It mine; for all Its beauty flowd from His fair Love Whose Mercy with my Vilenes strove. Nor must the stinking Puddle think that she Is beauteous, 'cause the Sun By kinde effusion Makes Her the Glass of his bright Majestie. 7 But sure, too sure, I am that Shame alone Belongs to all that I have done: Nor can my Blushes die So deep &amp; high My guilty Cheeks, but tinctur'd in A redder grain I finde my Sin; A grain so obstinate, that were the Blood Of JESUS less than what It is, my woefull Blot Could not be washd away by any Flood. 8 Yet Heavns (&amp; none but Heavns) allserching Ey Did this Years mystik Pangs descry, With which my Heart, alas, In travel was: For close I huggd my sweet Distress, And feasted on its bitterness. I feasted; but my cruel Banquet still Reveng'd my appetite, By torturing Delight, And bred more hunger as it more did fill. 9 That noble Soule whose Sweetnes made this Feast, And deignd to let Me be the Guest, Though much it knew, yet saw Not upon how Seveer &amp; mercyless a Rack My Thoughts &amp; all my Spirits were broke. No! Had it known, its generous Love would by Some speedy Art have found A way to close that Wound Which all this tedious Year did open ly. 10 Not all the Seas Wealth could with Me prevail Through such another Year to sail, In which the soule of Gall Was mixd with all My dearest Tides of Joy, whilst I By Absences strange cruelty A thousand present Shipwracks felt, &amp; though I was in ken (&amp; more,) Of my desired shore, Yet might (I know not why,) not thether row. 11 How often has my working Minde been tost, And in Amazements billows lost! Against the insultations Of mutinous Passions As often as I pitchd the feild So often was I forc'd to yeild: For in my bosomes Arcenal did ly My pretious Conqueror, and How then could I withstand Those volleys which from my own heart did fly? 12 What can I do, great LOVE, but sue to Thee, The Master of my heart &amp; Me? Yf this my deer Designe Run cross to thine; Yf it inferrs, (what I abhorr,) My noblest Freinds true damage; or My own Soules Loss: oh rather in the Sea Of all those Woes which can Wrack this poor Life of Man May I be plung'd, than it should compassd be. 13 But yf this Joy of mine suits with thy Pleasure, Give me possession of my Treasure. Fain would I, this Request Should be the Best; Yet still I would not, yf it be Not most intirely such to Thee. O JESU, Thou who se'st my Heart, &amp; all The Pangs which revell there, Give thy propitious Ear Unto thy prostrate Worms lamenting Call. 14 So shall this new uncertain Year, to Me Assure it self a Jubile; So shall my wearied Breast Attain such Rest As for thy Work may fitt Me; So No longer I perplexd shall go In Doubts &amp; Fears wilde Maze; So shall I strive To gain those Years which I Have lost before, &amp; by Thy Graces Aid, at least now gin to Live. Annivers: Baptismi Martj. 21. 1648. 1 How much worse than in vain Had I been Born That other Morn, Had I not now been Born again! For that was but my Death's, but this Alone of my true Life the Birthday is. 2 The Wormes own crawling Brother I then was Born, Vile &amp; forlorn Corruption being my foule Mother; From whome I could no Title have Of Heir to any Land, but to my Grave. 3 But by this second Birth I Kinred had With Heavn &amp; God; For She who now did bring Me forth Was Gods own Spouse, that Holy She Whose Catholik Wombe breeds Christianitie. 4 She brought Me forth; &amp; I Was now the Heir Unto the fair Inheritance prepar'd on high For those who study to maintain That Title They did by their Baptisme gain. 5 But has my study bin Thus provident; Or rather bent My own hearts Bliss to undermine? Like some wilde Heir, spurrd on by Hell Did I not Heavns Reversion madly sell? 6 Alas, I did: &amp; all The wretched price I took, did rise To nothing but a flood of Gall: For what can all this World to Me Afford, but most vexatious Vanitie? 7 O King of my poor Heart, Whose gratious ear Delights to hear A Sinners Crie: O Thou who art The Same forevermore, though I Alas, be chang'd into Deformity, 8 Remember thine own Love, And so forget How I on it Have heapd Ingratitude, &amp; strove To be, what yet I would not be Were the Worlds total Value offerd Me. 9 O no, sweet Lord, I would Be Thine, &amp; none But Thine alone: And though fond I my Bliss have sold To Vanity; I will not sell My Hope, since Thou art my Redeemer still. 10 Baptise Me then again In Mercies Flood, Which is thy Blood: And so no longer shall a Stain My woefull Difinition be, Nor Guilt the onely Clothes which cover Me. 11 So shall thy Glory shine Afresh in my New Purity; So, though the Happines be Mine, Yet still it shall belong to Thee, When Thou, not I, sole Owner art of Me.

But Measures now &amp; Numbers be Themselves no longer unto Me; Nor can their terminated Might Deal with those Torments which are Infinite. 3 The Soule of this Complaint, to none Is known, deer Lord, but Thee alone: Thou seest how lamentable I In a strange Hell of Sweetness frie: Thou se'st my Heart &amp; Me all rent Upon a Rack of Torturing Content. 4 Not all this World could hire Me to Flie from this delectable Woe. Yet yf thy Pleasure be to ease My deer &amp; pretious Miseries; Do, mighty Lord; thy Will is best: I yeild, &amp; will endure to be at Rest. 5 I think I yeild: O Jesu trie The bottome of thy Victory: O search, &amp; sift this heart, &amp; see It cheats not Me, nor injur's Thee. O yf it bends not, break it quite: That Heart is soundest, w?? is most Contrite.

Mortality, w?? now Knocks at my Fathers door, right neighbourlie To mine gives Warning, &amp; may heer Enter, for aught I know, as soon as there. 5 And let it enter, JESU, when Soe'r thy Pleasure is its way to ope; But first, oh first, do Thou come in, That by thy gracious Presence Thou mayst stopp What Thou admittest; for by Thee Deaths Ev'n shall be the Dawn of Life to Me. ??????????? March 13. 1649. 1 Twelve Moneths agoe, what rate would I too dear Have thought, to buy me but another Year; In which I Virtues Quarrell might Revenge with Poenitence's fist, And stoutly wreak my holy Spight Upon my most rebellious Breast: That so the Sight of my own Life might not Before I dy'd, death through my heart have shott! 2 Yet, though great LOVE hath reined Justice in From my bold Three-and-thirty Years of Sin; And giv'n me Mercy's generous leave This other annual Round to tread: Alas what use of this Repreive Has my ingratefull Madnes made, Who have but raisd my Guilts vast Mountain more By a Years height than it was swelld before! 3 Though I have seen our wretched Britain made The Isle of Monsters; though the onely Trade Our England drives be Frensy, and Rebellious Desperation; Yet I finde a more enormous Band Of Rebells in my Bosome mett: Rebells, whose furious stomach dares disdain Not Britains Monarch, but Heavns Soverain. 4 The lower House, the Commons of my Breast, My traiterous Passions, speciously drest In Liberties bewitching cloke; First trampling down my Will &amp; Reason As useless Peers, in triumph broke Into the gulfe of deepest Treason, And murdered their royal Lord again, Whose guilt was nothing but his Gentle Reign. 5 Afresh thus having JESUS crucifi'd, In Sinns anarchical carreer they ride: And I, alas, unhappy I, In woefull Vassalage enchaind, A Prey to my own Madnes ly; That Madnes, which for me hath gaind A decent Vengance on my proud Offence, A Rout of Tyrants for one gracious Prince. 6 With what sore Taxes did they pill &amp; poll The holy Score of my once thriveing Soule! How has their Fury stormd me from My own Free Hold, not leaving Me So much to dwell in, as the Home Of my own Self! how cruelie Have they by Sequestration seized even On that Reversion which I had of Heaven! 7 A King, a King, again, say I; &amp; none But Him who is our rightfull King alone! JESU, oh JESU, lend thine ear, Thine ever-gracious ear to Me, Whose broken Soule desires to bear No Yoke, no King, but thine &amp; Thee! I have this cheating Liberty, &amp; fain In thy deer Service would be free again. 8 For yf I be not; Why, why should I be At all! Or what is this New Year to Me, But a New Orb of Woe, upon Whose wheel I must be rackd again, And through Lifes longer Torments run To longest Deaths more heavy Pain? The thought of further Life slay's Me with Dread, Yf living still, must make me ever Dead. 9 O never never let my Vessell steer Through such another treason-foaming Year! My Passions no such Armies have, Nor Navies, to maintain their Pride; But Thou into Destructions Grave Canst easily tread their strongest Tide. Why shouldst not Thou, sweet Lord of Power &amp; Love, Who art MOST HIGH, be every where above? 10 O JESU be above, &amp; Reign in Me: So shall these Rebells melt to Loyaltie: So shall that other Perturbation Which all this Year hath toss'd my Breast And wov'n mysterious Vexation Into my deerest Joyes, molest My Soule no more with strange Anxietie, Nor tear it farr farr from it self, &amp; Thee. 11 Thine Ey alone is privie to the Smart Of those long Pangs which revelld in my heart; When my Desires from That were shutt From Which they could not severd be; When I was most where I was not; When onely Absence dwelt with me; When every houre hurri'd &amp; flung me to Those pretious Sweets to which I might not go; 12 When I could scorn all Danger, Toil, &amp; Pain, That most inestimable Gemm to gain, Yet by poor slender Nothings saw My way quite intercepted; and In spight of Loves allconquering Law, Ev'n brave Ascension at a stand; When the resolved Flame still wider spread, Yet on its noble Feuel might not feed: 13 When I, though on the brink of fulltide Joy, Liv'd in the squalid Desert of Dismay; When Unity it self might not Be one; When Times learnd to controll Beyond their Sphear, &amp; bridle what Was now eternal in my Soule; When I might not free Owner be of that Whereof I had intire possession gott. 14 Just reason of a guilty Blush could I In that my vehement Designe descry, An hecatombe of Thanks &amp; Praise I at that Fortunes foot would lay Which barracado'd all the ways That led to my desired Joy: But since my aim was pure, oh why must I So long obstructed be, I know not Why? 15 I know not Why: unless the Worth of that Invaluable Gemm, a barr did putt Against my Worthlessnes: &amp; then Jesu, I yeild, &amp; must confess I have no further plea, nor can Pretend desert of That which is So sweetly pretious: No, I know I must Miss my too-loftie Aim, yf Thou beest Just. 16 Yet since thy Justice-conquering Goodnes now Incourageth my Hopes afresh to grow; O never let them fade again, Nor sown into sad Intermission, But their mature Success obtain And flourish into sweet Fruition! O let them flourish! Or quite root them up. Dispair is better farr, than fruitless Hope. Anniversarium Baptismi Mar: 21. 1649. 1 O deer &amp; memorable Day to Me, From which I count my Christianitie! Eight Days I breath'd, but did not live, Bycause I onely was what I was Born; But Thou a blessed check didst give To my sad Fate, &amp; me with Life adorn. 2 That mighty Deluge which its fury hurld Beyond all Shores, &amp; wrack'd the anchient World, Bury'd not Mortals in so deep A Death, but the Baptismal Flood in more Assured Life their Soules doth steep, And roll them to Eternities high Shore. 3 Thus at this truelyest-living Fountains Head I into holy Life was Buryed: And had I kept that Purity Which in that liquid Sepulchre I found, Not Death it self could make me dy Who was Eternal by thus being Drownd. 4 But foolish I would needs be padling in The lazie filthly Lakes of nasty Sin; Till I had staind my careless Heart With poisnous Spotts, which like Plague-tokens seald Me for my Grave: Nor could the Art Of Man or Angel cure or comfort yeild. 5 O no! a LORD HAVE MERCY ON ME, was The onely Charm in that infected case: And so is still; for nothing but The soverain Power of MERCY can asswage Sinns strong Contagion, &amp; put Eases soft chains on my Diseases rage. ??????????? March. 13. 1650. 1 This Morning five &amp; thirty years Which op'd mine Eyes, did broach my tears: When, though I wept I knew not why, Each tear distilld a Prophecy; Liquid &amp; clear were they, But these in darknes lay, Where, like all others, they this Maxime held, Not to be understood untill fullfilld. 2 For what Diviners piercing Ey, Though help'd with those of heavn, in my Then-newborn-soule could read, That She Would foulest of all Monsters be: And, by mad venturing in The desperate Trade of Sin, Gain so much Loss, that these poor Eyes of mine Should need aforehand to acquaint with Brine? 3 Say, treacherous Heart, say with what reason Thou darest still abhorr that Treason Whose uncontrolld Contagion reigns In miserable Britains veins? Has it yet tutord Thee Into thy Loyaltie? Or has this new-past Year had power to bring Thee to Allegiance to thy heavnly King? 4 Where are those Promises which thy Sad-seeming Tongue did heap so high! Ask these Twelve Months yf ever Thou Didst keep with God thy Word or Vow. Why start'st Thou now away? Say, shameless Trayter, say, Could'st Thou indure thy Slave should break his Word So oft with Thee, as Thou hast with thy God? 5 Yet this Allmighty Lord of thine Still reins his long-due Vengance in: His Love with longer Time He baits, And strangely thus thy Leisure waits: Thy Death He doth command At distance yet to stand; And by this other Year he tempteth Thee Into the arms of sweet Eternitie. 6 And can the Flesh, the World, or He Who vaunts him self its Prince to be, Bid fairer for thee, or invite With richer arguments thy sight? Feel then, &amp; weigh, &amp; see What thus inamours thee: Alas thy Prize beguiles thy touch, &amp; all Thy Bliss, to empty Vanity doth fall. 7 Fool! wilt thou mock thy God? oh know The longer He doth draw his Bow, He shoots the surer, &amp; his Arrow Feirce Speed ev'n from Delay doth borrow. He at this Seige in vain Long long enough hath layn: Compell Him not to storm thee now, 'cause He Woo's thy Surrender with such Suavitie. 8 O do but yeild, &amp; thine shall be The truer happier Victorie: Yeild, yeild, &amp; win a Kingdom; even The Realm of Joy of Life of Heavn. To what can thy Desire More happily aspire, Than unto that, which not to reach, will be Calamities profound extremitie! 9 Nor canst Thou plead, That all thy Bliss A great way off suspended is, And totaly eclipsed by Lying in dark Futurity: What was that Heavn which thou Alone desirdst below? Is it not now into thy bosome thrown, Makeing most happy Thee double thine own? 10 How wert Thou torn the other Year Upon the rack of Hope &amp; Fear! How did thy Tears dropp through thy Quill And so into thy Verses steal; Whilst every Line prov'd true To their Inks mourning hue; And every Syllable sigh'd Sorrows tone, Each Word did weep, &amp; every Rime did grone! 11 But now that Night of thy Dismay Is broke up into Comforts Day: The Harvest of thy panting Hope Is ripe &amp; reap'd &amp; gatherd up: Thy dear Ambition now Wears on its crowned brow That most invaluable Jewell which Can robb both Indies of the name of RICH. 12 And what, what wouldst thou more than so, Thee into Virtues Schole to woo! View but the beauties of that Gemm By the pure light of its own beam: Read read, &amp; study there, And then confess yf e'r Thy bookish eyes in any leaves such sweet And lively fruits of pious Worth did meet. 13 What though Ascensions lofty pitch Surmounted thy unworthy reach! Yet may'st thou in a lower sphear Due motion keep, &amp; bright appear. Move then, oh Move, &amp; Shine, Whilst yet thy Time is thine: Take heed thine idle self thou dost not cheat, By plotting then to Rise, when thou must sett. 14 Rise, rise my Soule, &amp; sleep no more In sluggish sin, as heertofore. All Heavn stands ope, &amp; willt thou miss A mark so full &amp; fair as this? Fear not its height, allthough Thou crawlst a Worm below: 'Twill meet thy reaching Arms, &amp; draw thee up, Unless thy Bliss thou willfully dost stopp. Anniversarium Baptismi Marti 21. 1650. 1 Love, I am thine: for yf I be Not so; Self is not Self to me. No Title to my Self have I, But in thy deer Propriety; For this most memorable Day Polluted Me washd clean away, And I, who was before a dead And still-born Thing, was quickened Into a nobler Essence than Springs from the rotten loyns of Man: I of my mortal Parents wretched Sonn To be thy blessed Childe to Day begun. 2 O truest Father, how did thy Bounty inrich my Poverty! How large a Portion didst Thou On me, a younger Sonn, bestow! A Portion of Strength &amp; Health, Of Arts &amp; Natures usefull wealth, Of gratious Motions, holy Heats, Heart-cheering Joyes, spiritual Sweets, Of high &amp; noble Things, which none But such a Sire could give a Sonn: A Portion upon whose ample Store I might have bravely liv'd for evermore! 3 I might have liv'd; had foolish I To deadly Prodigality Not sold my self, &amp; turned Slave Before I dy'd, unto my grave: Had I that fair Estate not spent Fond Lusts &amp; Passions to content; Nor on the score with Vengance run, To be the surer twise undone. O! should my Creditors awake Their indignation, &amp; take Due course of Law against me, What would bayl Me from the bottom of Hells deepest Jayl! 4 Meanwhile, alas, all that I finde To feed my justly-starved Minde, Are sappless skinns of Vanitie, Husks drie &amp; starv'd as well as She: A Diet fitt enough for Swine And Me; since both of us combine With feet profane in dirt to tread Those Perles which would adorn our head, Or purchase nobler Cates which might Our palates court with pure delight. Ah cheating World, how hast thou mockd my taste, Obtruding onely Famin for a Feast! 5 But Thou, great Lord of endless love, Hast raised thy Patience farr above The mountain of my Guilt: &amp; I Onely from that thy Victory Pluck hopes of giving this my great Unhappiness a sure defeat. Behold thy pined Prodigall Doth at thy lowest footstool fall, Where I the prey of Pity ly; Quarter, oh, quarter, or I dy! I dy; for all my Living's spent &amp; gone; And none can raise the Dead but Thou alone. 6 I envy not thine Heirs, who be Sonns of devout Frugalitie; Nor reach I at a place in their Felicities exalted Sphear: Bold bold enough is my ambition, Into thy Pay to begg admission, And have my Name inroll'd &amp; blest Ev'n in thy meanest Hirelings list. Alas 'tis not for famishd Me To article with mighty Thee, For 'tis to Mercy I surrender now: O may I but be Thine, I care not how! ??????????? Marti 13. 1651. 1 As when a beauteous Morn brings forth An answerably-splendid birth, And Titan with a smileing face Gets up &amp; gins his golden race; Sereen &amp; cheerly Houres attend His wheels which up Noons mount ascend, Suffring no envious Clowd To crowd Into the glorious throne of Day Which now through all heavn doth her realm display. 2 Yet when faint &amp; decrepit grown Into the West she stumbles down; Some treacherous Windes have taken arms And musterd up rebellious Storms To damp her peace's gorgeous grace And tear her monarchies bright face; Whilst the defeated Sun Doth run From his fair colours, &amp; is wett Before he can into th' Atlantik gett. 3 How true that Day paints out to me This Years sweet-soure repugnancie! A Year in which my Joyes grew up Into the blade of cheerly Hope: But blasted then, did onely yeild A Crop of Greif from Comforts Feild: A Year which taught me how To grow Into a sad beleif that heer Delight's bright Perl's but a mistaken Tear. 4 Fair dawnd this Year, when I &amp; I, (All Turtles know this mystery,) Incouraged by pleasant health, Vie'd loves, &amp; multiply'd the Wealth Of that most pretious Union, which Denies that gold or gemms are rich: Nor did his progress fail To seal Upon our hopes fresh Joyes, when we Saw in that Spring nuptial Fertilitie. 5 How large a promise did he give That I should more than double live, Whilst in my pregnant Deerest I Seem'd rooted to posterity. How honestly at length he made Shew of performing what he had So fairly promis'd me, When he Payd me the pretious Daughter from The lovely Mother-perl's ingaged wombe! 6 How blooming now did I appear, Grown young &amp; fresh again in Her! Especaly when happy She Corrected her nativitie, And by a second birth became God's childe as well as mine: Her Name Was allso now no less Express An echo of her Mother, than Were those sweet lines which through her feature ran. 7 Thus this Eliza deerer was By being that Eliza's Glass. In this epitomie I read (Yet not at all diminished) The Mothers Sweets; in that full book Th' expansion of the Daughters Look. Thus did I feast my Joy, And lay My heart to take her deer repose Now on the Bud, now on the full blown Rose. 8 But ah! the flattering treacherous Year Which rose &amp; shin'd till now so cleer; With sudden frowns plough'd up his brow, And violently study'd how To mock my Joy's precocitie By levelling his storm at me. For by an envious stroke He broke My dainty Bud, which in that gust Was quite blown down &amp; buried in the dust. 9 Yet why do I accuse the Year, Which taught me (though by a seveer And nature-tearing lesson) not To build my hopes &amp; joys on what The easy gaine &amp; prize can be Of tottering Mortalitie. This Lesson &amp; hard Art By heart O may I get, &amp; run to thee Sweet JESU for true Rest's Stabilitie. Annivers: Baptismi Mart. 21. 1 Courage my Soule! what though thy foes combine Their might &amp; spight to undermine Thy Peaces fort, &amp; throw That Safety low Which thou Hast long in building been, &amp; fain That Fabrik's, &amp; thy Wishes, topp, wouldst gain? 2 Courage! This very Day must Item Thee Into an holy Braverie: This happy Day, wherein Thou didst begin To win A place in Valour's Army, and Under the LORD of HOSTS didst listed stand. 3 Thou knowst what Colours mighty He doth give And what fair badge thou didst receive: His bloody Crosse's Sighn Whose shape divine On thine Initiated face was sett, To valiant Patience consecrated it. 4 He, though arm'd with Omnipotence, did choose By Suffring to subdue his Foes: That Thou, who couldst not reach His Powers pitch Mightst stretch Thy hardy patient arms (for this, Weaknes may do,) to pull down Bayes and Bliss. 5 O cross not then that Cross, which marks thee out For meekly patiently stout. Wear not God's Badge in vain, But bravely strain To gain Those Palmes thou canst not loose, yf thou Wilt but endure a Conquerour to grow. The Journè May 17. 1652 1 My Parents deer to see to day My Duty summons me away: Yt must my heart first wait on Thee Great Father both of them &amp; me. To guide my journè that I may Remember still Thou art my Way! Thou art my Way, &amp; yf of Thee I miss, My playnest path will prove a Precipice. 2 To crave my Parents Blessing I This journè take: yet first to thy Dear Benediction must I sue To bless their Blessing into true And full effect: least in the breath Which gives it life, it findes its death. Great King of Bliss! in that sweet soveraintie Of thine, O may poor I a Subject be. 3 So shall I gain brave strength to stretch Through that laborious journè, which I going am; (&amp; needs must go) Ev'n whilst I stay at home; for to The unknown Land of Death am I Hurried by Sinn &amp; Destiny. Vain hopes of Rest, adieu: my birth I scorn To cross, since I a Traveller am born. The Winter-Spring May 18. 1 O how the Worlds Amazement now doth stare Upon this contradiction of the Year; Whilst frowning Januaries frost Doth smileing Maja's beauties blast; Whilst Winter his chaste bounds forgets And on the virgin Spring a rape committs. 2 Poor ravishd Spring! how every Leaf confesses The violence done to her goodly tresses! Her woefull head how sadly She Hangs down in every floure! No tree, No feild, no gardin, where she went But doth her piteous injury lament. 3 Mark well, my Heart, too plainly painted heer An embleme of thy self in this sad Year: The raies of Righteousnesses Sun By gracious neerness had begun. With vernal beauties thee to grace, And heavns sweet dew had washd &amp; cheerd thy face. 4 But blasted now by Indevotions cold Thy yeauthfull Spring turns withered &amp; old; The bedds where thy fair floures did grow, Alas are but their death-bedds now: Nipp'd in their budd thy firstfruits are; And thou canst onely say, Such Sweets grew heer. 5 And has some sudden anger snatchd away My courteous Sun? O no, thyself didst stray From thine own Bliss: He, constant He Desires not retrograde to be. It is not this, but th' other Sunn Who of himself doth back to Winter run. The Gentle Check May 19. 1 One half of me was up &amp; drest, The other still in lazy rest; For yet my prayers I had not sayd; When I close at her Mattens heard A dainty-tongued Bird, Who little thought how she did me upbrayd. 2 But Guilt caught hold of every Note, And through my breast the anthem shott: My breast heard more than did my ear, For now the tune grew sharp &amp; chode Me into thoughts of God, To whome most due my earlyer Accents were. 3 How shall I blush enough to see Poor Birds prevent my praise to thee! Dear Lord my Muse for pardon pants, And every Tardy guilty Tone Doth languish to a Grone: Alas to day she sings not, but recants. 4 Forgive, forgive my lazie Rhyme Which in its musik keeps not time. Yf thy sweet Patience lets me borrow Another Morn of Life, I give My promise heer to strive Before the Lark to be at heavn to morrow. The Sentinel To my Friend. May 20. 1 Thanks sweetest friend, who deckest me In shewing me mine own Deformitie. Alas, the eys ev'n of my Minde Though plac'd within, to things within are blinde; And, like those of my Body, on Externals spend their gazing selvs alone. Ay me, who thus become Abroad quicksighted, but stark blinde at home. 2 My faithfull eyes are those whereby The darkest bottom of my self I spy. What fools were Poets, who could finde No way but to conclude that Love is blinde! He who himself would right discover, The eys must borrow of a trusty Lover; Eys whence indeed those darts Of piercing fire flash forth which serch through hearts. 3 Dear Spie of me, thanks thanks again For this discovery; now me thinks 'tis plain How ougly I did muffled go In Melancholies veil. I know no Foe Whom more I hate than that black Witch, Yet much I love her too: Alas in such A snarled maze I move That heer I love my hate, &amp; hate my love. 4 Inestimable Sentinel, Upon thy loving guard oh stand thou still: Give the alarm whenever thou These clowds discoverest gathering on my brow; And help me in the charge, that I May conquer by thy cheerfull bravery. This way, my better Heart, Be thou my Second, though my Self thou art. The Farm May 21. 1 Tenant at will indeed I am; &amp; yet Wish for no Lease of this my life, since I Under so good a Lord do live, &amp; sitt At rent allmost as low as He is high: The greatest summ that He expects from me Is that which nothing costs, Humilitie. 2 Humility, with Homage, Fealty, and Some easy Services; for mighty He, Least I should shrink, lays to his own kinde hand And helps me to obey himself. oh free And gentle Lord, who to his Tenant gives, Aforehand, all the Rent that he receives! 3 As for the Farms increase, though I improve It to a thousand fold, yet still I pay No more to Him, but only more of love: And what gains heavns great King, yf Dust &amp; Clay Heap his affections on him! Thus, in fine The Farm's Rent's his, but all the Profits mine. 4 Besides, to keep my house in good repair, With all Materials He doth me supply. Yf to decay it falleth, I must bear The blame alone: yea when Mortality Shall tumble't into dust, that Ruine from My Fall &amp; first offence, at last, will come. 5 But now to leave so good a Farm, can I Contented be? oh yes I can, whene'r My Lord shall please to turn me out, since by His boundless Love eternal Mansions are Prepar'd above. of short-termd Tenants heer Who would not chuse to be Freeholders there? News May 22. 1 What haste, fond Jock! Nay thou shalt longer stay, Bycause thou thirstest thus to snatch The first buzz of the News, &amp; catch Thou knowst not what: The Story may Be sad, &amp; punish greedy thee; What harm then in deferring Miserie! 2 Stay but a while, &amp; thou the News shalt see Come, uninvited, to thy door, And honester that 'twas before: That Paint &amp; lying Braverie Which makes her young wilde face so gay, Will by truth-cleering Time be washt away. 3 Fear not Delay; the News, though tardy, yet Can be her self to Thee, one day, Or twenty hence: That which doth slay Her slight life, is not Absence, but Presence alone: the News is new When first she comes (though then she dyes) in view. 4 But hark, my Heart, the happiest News to thee Will be to finde it truely in Thy self: Is that old Man of Sin Banishd &amp; gone, &amp; canst thou see New holy youth bud in thy breast? This is the only News can make thee blest. 5 If after other News thou lingerest still, Look out, &amp; see where thou canst spy Devotion, Meeknes, Loyalty, Peace, Justice, &amp; sinceer good-will: Judge truly, &amp; thou canst not chuse But grant these old things are the greatest News. The Duell May 23. 1 Sad fruit of misapplyed Valour! Here Lies Shandoys wounded, &amp; there Compton slayn. O goodly gain Of gallant Duells! are Not Wounds &amp; Death fine things, when they are bought Humor and private Grudge to garnish out? 2 Surely there is another kinde of Duell As hardy, smart &amp; generously brave, Though not so cruel: A Duell which will save One of the Champions from the miseries Of Wounds &amp; Death, though in the fight he dies. 3 Yea &amp; so lawfull 'tis, that never Laws Were kept, but by this Duells good success. Nor is it less Strange in the Lists it draws, For though this fight through all the world be fought, The feild is pitcht within &amp; not without. 4 The Duellers are none but onely I Or onely You; for I &amp; You, alone Are more than One. In every heart do ly Two active Parties, Flesh &amp; Spirit, whose Immortal hate makes them most mortal foes. 5 How strangely solemne's this Incounter! where God, Men, &amp; Angels, all Spectators be; Where Victorie Doth no less prize conferr Than Heavn or Hell: Where the fights consummation On this side's Death, on that Mortification. 6 Since then no Quarter heer can given be, Courage, my Spirit, as thou lovst thy life. On this short strife Depends eternitie Of rest &amp; peace, &amp; how how canst thou merit Yf thou in courage faylst, thy name of Spirit? The World May 24. 1 Nay now I'm sure my judgment's sound, Since ripe experience is its ground. Why, I my self have felt &amp; seen Thy tedious Vanity; Fond shameless World, &amp; canst thou ween I will for thee ev'n common sense deny? 2 Thou wear'st a beauteous skin, I grant; And do the deadly Serpents want Those dangerous hypocrisies? Or is the Poisons soule Less its curs'd self, bycause it lies In the brave ambush of a golden boule? 3 When Israels, &amp; Wisdomes, King Did stoutly to the touchstone bring Thy fairest Peeces, did not they Prove base-bred counterfets; Whose stamp though neat, &amp; colour gay, Their purest ore was but refined Cheats. 4 And oh that I had been content To rest on his Experiment! But since I at the cost have been By thee deceivd to be, 'Tis not another World could win My heart to dote: or trust on empty thee. 5 Go fawn on those whose frothy minde Can solace in a bubble finde, And Juno in a Clowd imbrace; Who by the lying Paint Which smiles upon their Idols face Doubt not to count the beauties of their Saint. 6 And yet thy Paint's so silly too, It can no warey Lover woo. Indeed good Shaddows sprucely show; But where the Picture is Nothing besides, (and such art thou) It proves but artificial Ouglines. The Servant May 25. 1 Now on my Conscience thou art right My Heart, who tellst me, I This morning full as justly might Have let my anger fly At my forgetfull sinfull self, as at My Servant who my strait Command forgot. 2 I have a Master too: nor is My Servant bound to my Commands, so much as I to His In whose great family Were I not entertained I could not live; 'Tis He, who to myself myself doth give. 3 Ah patient Master of bold Me, How oft hast thou renued Thy soft Commands, &amp; ernestlie My fugitive heart persued; Yea, and (what I could hardly stoop to do) Vouchaf'd thy Slaves obedience to woo! 4 How gross in my Injustice, who Could not this fault digest From mine own Servant, yet can so Gentle a Lord resist! And now could I for shame expect that he When I disloyal am, should faithfull be! 5 O teach me holy policie, Great Lord, &amp; never let Me copies of disloyaltie To my own Servants set. Subdue my stubborn Will, for then I shall Best have it, when I have it not at all. Game May 26. 1 Not from the stern Portch did I lern This Lesson, but from civil Reasons Temple: Nor can thy fine example Outbrave my sober grounds, or prove that I A Heretik am in Gentility. 2 I needs must tell Thee, Gallant, still Thy hounds &amp; hawks I never yet could see Catch such delight to me, As oft is caught by these two fingers when After a flea in hott persute they runn. 3 Dost thou not know It is not Thou That hawk'st &amp; huntest, but thy hound &amp; hawk? And dost not blush to talk Of generous Sport, when thou their Lord, at least Art the Attendant on thy Bird and Beast! 4 Nay more than so, Their Vassal too Thou art, &amp; whether thorough fair or foule Thy most inslaved Soule Is glad to thrust thee, yf they lead the way: Are these the paths to manly noble Joy? 5 The Griffen, or The Tygre, farr Outvie such Joys, when they without the aid Of hawk or hound have preyd Upon their game, &amp; needed not, like thee, For their wilde pastimes borrowers to be. 6 Is it not fine Delight to win This rare applause when thou in weary sweat Dost from thy sport retreat: Behold, the Man, &amp; hawks &amp; hounds are come Ev'n with a conquerd hare or partridge home. 7 Then, yf you will, Bate the mad hell Of oathes which haunts this trade: yet can I not Be charmd to toile in what Pretendeth not to yeild me other gains Then onely this, My Labour for my Pains. 8 That Sport is known Best to thine own Huntsmen &amp; falkners; yet will never they Unless by ample Pay Be charmd to follow it: 'tis not the Game, No, 'tis thy Money which delighteth them. 9 But noblest things, Princes &amp; Kings Are of these Games the granted Soverains too: And what yf I have no Ambition to play like them? though they Perhaps seek nothing less in Sports than Play. 10 Yet please thy will And play thy fill; But tie not me to this thy Loosnes, who Perchance know what to do. What yf I rather list to hunt, as high As Nimrod in the feilds of History? 11 What yf I take Delight to make My Contemplations resolute wings outstretch Thy hawks sublimest reach? On, on, for me: yf I above it am, Let me alone, I shall not spoil thy game. Ascension May 27. 1 A feast, &amp; yet the very Day Our Bridegrome bear our Joys away? Besides, the Comforter, who might Supply us with Delight, Is ten days off, &amp; may not we Now fast by sad authority? 2 O no! this happy day must be The holy Feast of Sympathie: 'Tis to his Coronation Our head to day is gone; Our reign commenceth heer, &amp; we Begin this morning Kings to be. 3 Heavns Kingdome now is open sett: And yf we will not frustrate it, Our Heads is our Ascension too; And though wee'r left below, In Him to Us is truely given Livery &amp; seisin of all heaven. 4 Then take we state upon us now, Disdaining all that is below Our royaltie: our sphears above And there, there let us move. For what have they to do, who dwell In heavn with earth, much more with hell! Friends May 28. 1 Thy Friends! Nay spare the plural there; Such things as Friends are singular: Thou of thy Phoenixes as well Mayst tell Thy tale, &amp; be belev'd as soon That thou hast many of what scarce is one. 2 Shines thy Sun fair? that gorgeous light To shew a Freind is too too bright: The day with gloomy shades opprest Will best Discover Him, whose Worth by none But its own glorious rays is seen alone. 3 Alas thy fawning Courtiers be Friends of thy Fortune, not of Thee: Let her but frown, &amp; they will do So too. Be warey then, &amp; just as farr Rely on Them, as Thou canst trust to Her. 4 But hast thou met a faithfull Heart? In spight of Fortune blest thou art. Write others down Acquaintance, but yet Admit Sole him into thy Friends dear Roll; Them in thine arms imbrace, Him in thy Soule. 5 For who is thy souls Spouse but He? O then with him contented be. Let chastity thy love commend And lend No ear to wanton Syrens, who Would thee to breach of Friendships wedlock woo. The Bankrupt May 29. 1 Despise him not, though he A Bankrupt be: To peeces broke he is indeed, Yet not to nothing. Do not tread Those fragments into dust, with which He hopes a Composition to reach. 2 Thy Break is greater farr Than his, nor are Thy means sufficient to Compound With thy great Creditor: look round About thy Nothing now, &amp; say What thou hast left thy debts to God to pay. 3 Wouldst thou thy Body yeild To prison? build No hopes on that sad plott; alas The law on thee must further pass: Thy Soul is allso forfeit, and Th' eternal Jayl for both doth open stand. 4 Cheat not thyself, nor say I'l run away. What world from Gods arrest can hide His vainly-fugitive Worm? beside, No friend on earth can ever be A Surety or sufficient Bayl for thee. 5 No way away to run Hast thou but one: FORGIVING'S thy sole way to woo Thy Creditor the like to do. Nay He'l outdo thee heer, for He For pardning part, will all remitt to thee. Detraction May 30. 1 Thinkst thou to scape this Monsters teeth? Then hope to fly the jaws of Death: Nay, things whose pitch Is farr above the reach Of any Death, are yet assaulted by Detractions most unbounded Cruelty. 2 How oft has Blasphemies black Tongue At God him self her venome flung? And wouldst thou fare Better than things which are The Best of all? faint fool, that cannot be Wherein thy God's a Sharer, Miserie. 3 'Tis rank Repugnancy at which Thy fond ambition doth reach: Canst thou tell how Like every one to grow? Unless thou canst, thou must contented be To let those things which differ, disagree. 4 To win the Proud Mans praise, canst thou Plant insolence on thine own brow; Yet still, to reap Fame with the Sordid, creep Beneath fair Ingenuity? oh no! What creature e'r was Worm &amp; Eagle too? 5 Since then Detraction must at thee Be snarling, on necessitie; In the compleat Armour of Virtue meet Thy peevish Foe, who then, the more she bite, The more she'l break her teeth, &amp; knaw her spight. Virtue May 31. 1 Virtue! why first she brings not in Such gains, as gallant Sin. Has not his squeamish conscience quite Beggerd your Loyal Wight? Whilst the brave Rebell reigns upon Your royal Martyrs throne. 2 And then, she's not gentile. pray shew Me in the list of new Sheer Fashions so much as but The name of Virtue put. And must we plod in the plain rode Of our stale Grandsires Mode? 3 Besides, She's baseborn, &amp; below A Gentleman: for how Can she pretend to Gallantry Who cannot be, yf high? What Exc'llance can in her be seen, Whose essence is the Mean? 4 Lastly, wherever she doth come She's viley troublesome; Putting her deerest Friends to great Expence of pains &amp; sweat. Troth let her go for me: a guest Like her, when gone is best. 5 Thus dreams the Fool what pleases him, And thus talks in his dream. And let him talk: deer Virtue, he By blaming praiseth thee. Wise eyes would strait suspect thy rays Should Fools thy Lustre praise. Thrift June 1. 1652. 1 Say not, Tis base to spare, Unless thou knew'st what spareing were. Hadst that been thy forefather's minde More reason thou wouldst finde To rayle on Spending: but thy scorn thou now On thine own Prides Foundation doth throw. 2 Is't base? bold Prodigal, Know'st thou whom heer thou dost miscall? Dares thy contemptuous Censure fling Basenes on Bounties King? He, noblest He, his own miraculous Gift Was not ashamed to seal up with Thrift. 3 When he had thousands fed, He set on every bit of bread His saving care: Let nothing be Squanderd &amp; lost, sayd He, But up with every crumb: yea though his word To all the World a banquet could afford. 4 Will thy estate hold out As well as his, that thou shouldst flout The thought of Sparing? or wouldst thou More generousnes show Than God himself? Ah fool, yf thou wouldst be Noble indeed, thy Copy must be He. 5 'Tis thine who findst the fault With Thrift; for Thrift is Bounties Salt, Which from corrupting keeps it free, And makst it lasting be. Belev't, he best knows how to spend (whate'r Thy fancy weens,) who best knows how to spare. Avarice June 2. 1 And truly yesterday I did suspect as much: away Foule misgotten Elf, Thou cheat'st thy silly self In thinking I had any drift To favor thee by praising Thrift. 2 Hence odious Avarice, Thou mad &amp; self-revenging Vice, Who dost no toyl refuse For that thou dar'st not use. Thrift onely gathers, Thou dost scrape, She to injoy, Thou but to keep. 3 Thou Jayler art, but She The Steward of her gold: with thee It rusts, with her it shines: Nor do its deepest Mines Smother &amp; lock it up so fast As the vast gulph of thy dark chest. 4 For that dark chest of thine No pioner must hope to mine, Since thy Necessitie Cannot sufficient be To digg thy treasure thence; so deep Thou, to thy loss, thy gains dost keep. 5 Less doth the Thunders crack Than news of petty Charges, wake Thy wretched fears; &amp; though All thy religion's how The best of money to possess, Thy Money never current is. 6 Some Beast or other is The embleme of each other Vice: But never Brute was yet So brutish as to get The world a copie of foule Thee: Midst Monsters, thou must Monster be. Honor June 3. 1 Ambitious Sir, take heed; For thou on Glass dost tread. No Glass more beautifull &amp; cleer Than all the paths of Honor are; No Glass more slippery can be Or brittle, than deceitfull She. 2 Ambitious Sir take heed, Thou trustest to a Reed. No Reed's more tost &amp; scorned by All Windes, than Honors bravery: No Reed will wound more deeply Thee Who leanst on it, than treacherous She. 3 Ambitious Sir take heed; Thou rid'st a dangerous Steed. No Steed his crest doth more advance, Or proudlyer than Honor prance: No Steed did e'r so desperatlie Stumble, as most uncertain She. 4 Ambitious Sir, take heed; Thou dost on Poison feed. No Poison in a goodlyer cup Than that of Honor's served up: No Poison e'r made drinker be More swollen, than doth banefull She. 5 Ambitious Sir take heed; And in brave Haman read A wholesome Lesson: who but He Honor's own Darling was! Yet see His ruines monstrous mockery, Who fell full fifty cubits high. Physik June 4. 1652. 1 Strait for y? Doctor send: That's thy first word, &amp; hastiest care; When some Disease, or but y? fear Of it, hath made thee sick. And I commend Thy diligence, provided thou What thou allow'st thy self wilt but thyself allow. 2 Thy Minde's as much &amp; more Thyself, than is thy Body: be Impartial then, &amp; equalie At least dispense thy providences store; Especaly since thou mayst finde More than a Spittle of Diseases in thy Minde. 3 The Aigue of cold Fear Doth nip thee up; or Lusts dogdays A burning Fever in the rayse. The Boulimie of Avarice doth tear Thy restless ever-hungry heart, Or thou in Prodagalities Consumption art. 4 Pride's dangerous Tympanie Thee to a monstrous bulk doth swell; Or Drunkenesses Dropsie fill But not suffice thee: Curiositie With a wilde Itch doth hant thee, or The Gout of Lazines make thee unfitt to stirr. 5 Ah most diseased thing! And darst thou still forbear to fly To Physiks Sanctuary? Why, Since Fear of Dying thee so deep doth sting, Drawst thou securely thy short breath, Who ly'st just at the point of everlasting Death? Selflove June 5. 1 To Love thy neighbour as thy self, will prove The Summ of Virtue; yet Selflove The total is of Vice. Unhappy riddle this, That thine own Rule should perfect be To all the World besides, but not to thee. 2 When self-conceited Lucifer so high Did soar on wings of Philauty, The foolish Gallant fell As low as lowest hell. Corrupted Good's the worst of Evil: As God is Love himself, Selflove's a Devil. 3 No Hate's so dangerous as Selflove, by which We ask our own selvs to death bewitch. Ask but Narcissus what Inchanted him to that Dainty, but deadly fate, &amp; He Will answer, 'Twas Selflove which drowned Me. 4 Do's not thy sober indignation rise Against false-hearted Flatteries Which only tickle thee Into a Fallacie? How dar'st thou then take such delight In being thine own constant Parasite? 5 Would'st love thyself indeed? come then &amp; throw Thy hate at what thou lovest now. 'Tis not thy Self, but thy Passions &amp; Lusts which ly In thy loves arms; all other Foes God bids thee love, I grant, but never those. 6 Thy Soule's thy Self, &amp; what thy God did make; Not what thy Sinns: Mend that Mistake, And then Selflove will be Ev'n Virtues self to thee. Thy riddle then will cease, and thou By Self-loves rule mayst charity bestow. Pentecost June 6. 1 Oseasonable Feast! Never had We More need of Thee: So low these woefull Times had prest Our heavy hearts, none but the Comforter Himself, could our dark clowds of Sorrow cleer. 2 'Tis well he comes from heaven: For our poor earth Cannot put forth One sprout or bud of Comfort; even Our Joys lament, whilst a new Sea doth now (Woes stormy Sea) about our Britain flow. 3 How sudden &amp; how strange A Legion We Of Spirits see, Which all about securely range! How desperately are wretched we possest: And who but thou can be our Exorcist? 4 Thou, mighty Spirit, who Confusion from The Worlds first wombe Didst sweetly chase: Our Waves of Woe Now crave thy ayd; oh gently move on them, And Britains Chaos into order tame! Witt June 7. 1 But who has Witt enough to tell Me what it is? Thou mayst as well Hope Proteus's visage to express As her wilde face, since dubious she Truly to be herself, any thing els must be. 2 Now old, now young again; now low, And now as high; Now corsive, now Gratious with tickling Lenity; Proud Spanish now, now smug &amp; sleek French, portly Roman now, now most delicious Greek. 3 Sometimes her looser garb is Prose, Sometimes in verse Straitlac'd she goes; Now she as low as hell doth curse, Now swear as high as heavn: her paint Shews her sometimes a Devil, &amp; few times a Saint. 4 Well is she tutord how to rant, Drink, drab, &amp; play And fear no want Though more then all she casts away. Me thinks tis worth the while to see Whether she would not prove too chargable for me. 5 Why she may easly spend a Man His soule &amp; all. Sure yf I can I'l save that charge: Let the World call Me as they list: whats that to me? Tis best, and I had rather Wise than Witty be. Entertainment June 8. 1 Wouldst know what entertainment I expect? Why, nothing but Good cheer. But, prithee let not this reflect Thy hospitable care Upon thy Cellar or thy Kitchin; I By cupps &amp; dishes count not jollity. 2 Not from thy Cook or Butler, but from thee I for my wellcome look: Which will be best, yf thou wilt be Butler thyself &amp; Cook: Let mine eys drink thy cheerfull countnance, ne'r Shall I for bright &amp; brisque Canary care. 3 A Mess of Smiles gentiley garnishd out With spruce Discourse, will be A daintyer Feast then ever ought Its quaint nativitie To the most learned kitchin; specaly When hearty Symptomes bear it company. 4 Into the bargain would thy courtesy Content the Belly too; Be sure, for what's but by the by Thou mak'st not most adoe. In thine own Sweetnes I the banquet place; As for thy Meat, I shall but count it Sauce. Riches June 9. 1 O had I but ten thousand pounds a year! Fool, thou hast more, Had'st thou that Wish, thy Wealth would make thee swear That thou wert poor; And so thou art not now, who hast Enough to spend: wouldst have enough to waste? 2 Alas thou canst not; had thou all the Ore Both Indies breed Twould quite starve Prodagalitie; No store Knows how to feed The gulf of that strange Monster, whose Vast stomach by abundance greater grows. 3 My Lord, with his ten thousand pounds a year Doth cleerly want Full twice ten thousand Things which thou canst spare: His means is scant, But ample thine, for 'tis confest That he the richest is, who needeth least. 4 Besides, thou knowest not the charge of such A large estate: 'Twill spend thee all thy Rest, &amp; cost so much Of Quiet, that No honest Beggar thou wilt finde So needy in Content, as thy poor Minde. 5 Thou must be put to finde so many Men And Horses for The service of that proud Estate; and then Maintain the Warr At thine own charge; that Warr whereby Thou must defend &amp; keep thy Credit high. 6 Selfcheated Slave, the more thy Servants are The more hast thou Thyself to serve: less costly is the care Which they bestow Than thine; their Services sure end Is erning, thine doth only make thee spend. The Alarm June 10. 1 Twas fairly done, Mortalitie, To give a warning peece before the fight. And heer my Thanks I render thee For that Alarm thou gavest me last night. And yet thou cunning art, who by Weaknes thy strength on me dost try. 2 By this light skirmish I am taught What to expect when thou dost charge me home. So kindely that distemper wrought Upon my heart, that she hath reaped from My bodies sicknes, such a crop Of health, as cheers her into hope. 3 Into fair hope that I shall dare To meet thy main battalia, &amp; quit The vain &amp; most ignoble fear Of Deaths assault; whom I desire to set Upon me in the open feild, That so I may with honor yeild. 4 For yeild I must, &amp; will; nor need Death any subtile ambush lay for me: I have no plot to run, &amp; lead That fate a dance which cannot shunned be. Yet by Surrender, might I choose, Not by Surprize, my Life I'd loose. S. Barnabie June 11. 1 Mistaken Priest Thou mightily disparagest, With those thy Oxen &amp; thy Garlands, Him Whom thou to deifie dost seem: Thy calculation's still too low, for He Is not thy Jupiter, but Barnabie. 2 Yet though above Thy stupidly-adored Jove, (That Jove who having been a famous Bull Himself, for kindreds sake might well Be to his cousen Oxen kinder than To have them sacrific'd,) he's still a Man: 3 A Man like thee In passionate infirmitie. Which though thou doubtest now, thoud'st grant too true Shouldst thou that Paraxysme view Whose storm will their calm Union overbear And Paul &amp; Barnabie in sunder tear. 4 Pluck courage then From hence: since Saints themselves are Men, Men may be Saints, &amp; humane Passions be Cohabitants with Sanctity. Prate not, pround Stoik, that the onely high Way to heavns Gate through Zeno's Portch doth ly. The Gardin June 12. 1 The Gardins quit with me: as yesterday I walked in that, to day that walks in me; Through all my memorie It sweetly wanders, &amp; has found a way To make me honestly possess What still Anothers is. 2 Yet this Gains dainty sence doth gall my Minde With the remembrance of a bitter Loss. Alas, how odd &amp; cross Are earths Delights, in which the Soule can finde No Honey, but withall some Sting To check the pleasing thing! 3 For now I'm hanted with the thought of that Heavn-planted Gardin, where felicitie Flourishd on every Tree. Lost, lost it is; for at the guarded gate A flaming Sword forbiddeth Sin (That's I,) to enter in. 4 O Paradise! when I was turned out Hadst thou but kept the Serpent still within, My banishment had been Less sad &amp; dangerous: but round about This wide world runneth rageing He To banish me from me: 5 I feel that through my soule he death hath shott; And thou, alas, hast locked up Lifes Tree. O Miserable Me, What help were left, had JESUS'S Pity not Shewd me another Tree, which can Enliven dying Man. 6 That Tree, made Fertile by his own dear blood; And by his Death with quickning virtue fraught. I now dread not the thought Of barracado'd Eden, since as good A Paradise I planted see On open Calvarie. Palmestrie June 13. 1 Art sure th'ast given so much to the Poor? Was't not thy meaning to bestow Part on thine own Vain-glory? Never score Up that on Gods account, which thou Spendst on the Devil; nor make Charitie Hell purveyor, who should Heavns steward be. 2 I'l not inquire thorough what trumpets throat Thou spak'st the prologue to thy Gift; Nor in what carefull pomp thou gav'st thy groat; Nor what a hard &amp; piteous shift Thou mad'st to let Spectators know that thou Didst three weeks since another groat bestow. 3 Indeed no such intelligence; for I By Palmestrie can read it plain: Thy right hand to thy left did it descry, And now thy left tells tales again. What canst thou answer, who dost guilty stand By the cleer evidence of thine own hand?</field>
