      <field name="fulltext">NOVI LAPSUS APRILâJUNE, 1891. DE LAPSIBUS PRIORIBUS. TWO ROUNDELS. 1. The Poet's Prayer. To buy my bookâif you will be so kindâ Is all I ask of you; and not to look What fruit lies hid beneath the azure rind: To buy my book. This for her hymn-book Rosalind mistook, When worshipping with yokel, maid, and hind; Neaera read it in a flowery nook, And gave her loose curls to the wanton wind. For this her grammar Sylvia once forsook, Of you I only askâyou will not mind?â To buy my book. Cambridge Review, June, 1891. 2. To an Indiscreet Critic. As J. K. S. I made my bid for fame And money, which is sweeter than success, Though Mr ? is possibly the same as J. K. S. Was it perhaps an error of the press? Is some malign compositor to blame? Or was it just the reader's carelessness? Or your astute reviewer's little game,â His lapsus calami as I should guess? In any case I wish to sign my name as J. K. S. Globe, April, 1891. FROM THREE FLY LEAVES. 1. To P. L., aged 4Â½. Ah Phyllis! did I only dare To hope that, as the years go by, And you, a maid divinely fair, The cynosure of every eye, Have fixed the wandering minds of men, And found a fare for scores of hearses, You still will open, now and then, My little book of verses; Or did I, bolder yet, aspire To hope that any phrase of mine, Aglow with memory's cheering fire Will burn within that heart of thine; Although my brow be bare of bays, My coffers not replete with gain, I shall notâwhat's the foolish phrase?â Have written quite in vain. May, 1891. THE RETORT COURTEOUS. I. ENGLAND AND AMERICA. 1. On a Rhine Steamer. Republic of the West, Englightened, free, sublime, Unquestionably best Production of our time. The telephone is thine, And thine the Pullman Car, The caucus, the divine Intense electric star. To thee we likewise owe The venerable names Of Edgar Allan Poe, And Mr Henry James. In short it's due to thee, Thou kind of Western star, That we have come to be Precisely what we are. But every now and then, It cannot be denied, You breed a kind of men Who are not dignified, Or courteous or refined, Benevolent or wise, Or gifted with a mind Beyond the common size, Or notable for tact, Agreeable to me, Or anything, in fact, That people ought to be. 2. On a Parisian Boulevard. Britannia rules the waves, As I have heard her say; She frees whatever slaves She meets upon her way. A teeming mother she Of Parliaments and Laws; Majestic, mighty, free: Devoid of common flaws. For her did Shakspere write His admirable plays: For her did Nelson fight And Wolseley win his bays. Her sturdy common sense Is based on solid grounds: By saving numerous pence She spends effective pounds. The Saxon and the Celt She equitably rules; Her iron rod is felt By countless knaves and fools. In fact, mankind at large, Black, yellow, white and red, Is given to her in charge, And owns her as a head. But every here and thereâ Deny it if you canâ She breeds a vacant stare Unworthy of a man: A look of dull surprise; A nerveless idle hand: An eye which never tries To threaten or command: In short, a kind of man, If man indeed he be, As worthy of our ban As any that we see: Unspeakably obtuse, Abominably vain, Of very little use, And execrably plain. II. MEN AND WOMEN. 1. In the Backs. As I was strolling lonely in the Backs, I met a woman whom I did not like. I did not like the way the woman walked: Loose-hipped, big-boned, disjointed, angular. If her anatomy comprised a waist, I did not notice it: she had a face With eyes and lips adjusted thereunto, But round her mouth no pleasing shadows stirred, Nor did her eyes invite a second glance. Her dress was absolutely colourless, Devoid of taste or shape or character; Her boots were rather old, and rather large, And rather shabby, not precisely matched. Her hair was very far from beautiful And not abundant: she had such a hat As neither merits nor expects remark. She was not clever, I am very sure, Nor witty nor amusing: well-informed She may have been, and kind, perhaps, of heart; But gossip was writ plain upon her face. And so she stalked her dull unthinking way; Or, if she thought of anything, it was That such a one had got a second class, Or Mrs So-and-So a second child. I do not want to see that girl again: I did not like her: and I should not mind If she were done away with, killed, or ploughed. She did not seem to serve a useful end: And certainly she was not beautiful. Cambridge Review, February, 1891. 2 On the King's Parade. As I was waiting for the tardy tram, I met what purported to be a man. What seemed to pass for its material frame, The semblance of a suit of clothes had on, Fit emblem of the grand sartorial art And worthy of a more sublime abode. Its coat and waistcoat were of weird design Adapted to the fashion's latest whim. I think it wore an AthenÃ¦um tie. White flannels draped its too ethereal limbs And in its vacant eye there glared a glass. In vain for this poor derelict of flesh, Void of the spirit it was built to house, Have classic poets tuned their deathless lyre, Astute historians fingered mouldering sheets And reared a palace of sententious truth. In vain has y been added unto x, In vain the mighty decimal unrolled, Which strives indefinitely to be ?. In vain the palpitating frog has groaned Beneath the licensed knife: in vain for this The surreptitious corpse been disinterred And forced, amid the disinfectant fumes, To yield its secrets to philosophy. In vain the stress and storm of politics Beat round this empty head: in vain the priest Pronounces loud anathemas: the fool In vain remarks upon the fact that God Is missing in the world of his belief. Vain are the problems whether space, or time, Or force, or matter can be said to be: Vain are the mysteries of Melchisedec, And vain Methuselah's unusual years. It had a landlady I make no doubt; A friend or two as vacant as itself; A kitchen-bill; a thousand cigarettes; A dog which knew it for the fool it was. Perhaps it was a member of the Union, Who votes as often as he does not speak, And ârecommendsâ as wildly as he spells. Its income was as much beyond its merits As less than its inane expenditure. Its conversation stood to common sense As stands the Sporting Times (its favourite print) To wit or humour. It was seldom drunk, But seldom sober when it went to bed. The mean contents of these superior clothes Were they but duly trained by careful hands, And castigated with remorseless zeal, Endowed with purpose, gifted with a mind, And taught to work, or play, or talk, or laugh, Might possibly aspireâI do not knowâ To pass, in time, for what they dare to scorn, An ordinary undergraduate. What did this thing crawling 'twixt heaven and earth, Amid the network of our grimy streets? What end was it intended to subserve, What lowly mission fashioned to neglect? It did not seem to wish for a degree, And what its object was I do not know, Unless it was to catch the tardy tram. Granta, June, 1891. RESCUED FROM THE WASTE PAPER BASKET. Parker's Piece, May 19, 1891. To see good Tennis! what diviner joy Can fill our leisure, or our minds employ? Not Sylvia's self is more supremely fair, Than balls that hurtle through the conscious air. Not Stella's form instinct with truer grace Than Lambert's racket poised to win the chase. Not Chloe's harp more native to the ear, Than the tense strings which smite the flying sphere. When Lambert boasts the superhuman force, Or splits the echoing grille without remorse: When Harradine, as graceful as of yore, Wins better than a yard, upon the floor; When Alfred's ringing cheer proclaims success, Or Saunders volleys in resistlessness; When Heathcote's service makes the dedans ring With just applause, and own its honoured king; When Pettitt's prowess all our zeal awoke Till high Olympus shuddered at the stroke; Or, when, receiving thirty and the floor, The novice serves a dozen faults or more; Or some plump don, perspiring and profane, Assails the roof and breaks the exalted pane; When vantage, five games all, the door is called, And Europe pauses, breathless and appalled, Till lo! the ball by cunning hand caressed Finds in the winning gallery a nest; These are the moments, this the bliss supreme, Which makes the artist's joy, the poet's dream. Let cricketers await the tardy sun, Break one another's shins and call it fun; Let Scotia's golfers through the affrighted land With crooked knee and glaring eye-ball stand; Let football rowdies show their straining thews, And tell their triumphs to a mud-stained Muse; Let india-rubber pellets dance on grass Where female arts the ruder sex surpass; Let other people play at other things; The king of games is still the game of kings. Cambridge Review, May, 1891. The Street Organs Bill, 1891. Grinder, who serenely grindest, As thou groundest ages back, Till thou ultimately findest Legislators on thy track: Grinder, there is one Jacoby, There is Lubbock, prince of Barts, Sternest of Professors: oh be- Ware of his infernal arts. Guyer Hunter backed it bravely, Backed the Bart's oppressive bill: So did he whose name is Staveley, And whose other name is Hill. If they pass their cruel measure, If the House is true to them, You must never give us pleasure, Grinder, after 8 p.m. When the dawn with rosy finger, Dissipates the eastern gloom, You and your machine must linger Silent in your silent room. Grinder, if you are not willing, When invited, to desist, You must pay your fortieth shilling, Wretched instrumentalist! Failing that,âa fate unkinderâ You must languish in a gaol One laborious fortnight: grinder, Pray, oh pray that they may fail. Pall Mall Gazette, April, 1891. Ode on the 450th Anniversary Celebration at Eton. Think of a number: double it (If that does not surpass thy wit); Subtract a dozen: add a score: Divide by twenty: multiply By twice the cube of x &amp; y, And half again as many more: Then take the twenty-seventh root And logarithmic sine to boot, And if the answer does not show Just nine times fifty, make it so. There's something more than half divine In fifty multiplied by nine: And never integer has been So grand as thirty times fifteen: The total I could doubtless praise In many other striking ways: But this at least is very plain,â The same will never come again. Then make an exhibition please And summon guests from far and wide: And marry mystic melodies To odes instinct with proper pride. Invoke the Founder's mighty name, And boast of Gray's and Shelley's fame: For this is very sure: that we Who missed the latest jubilee Shall not improbably be vexed By missing equally the next. Then let us resolutely strive This mighty fact to keep alive That 5 times 9 is 45; And furthermore the truth to fix (In their behoof whose course will run In June of 1981) That 54 is 9 times 6. Granta, June, 1891. Steam-Launches on the Thames. Henley, June 7, 1891. Shall we, to whom the stream by right belongs, Who travel silent, save, perchance, for songs; Whose track's a ripple,âleaves the Thames a lake, Nor frights the swanâscarce makes the rushes shake; Who harmonize, exemplify, complete And vivify a scene already sweet: Who travel careless on, from lock to lock, Oblivious that the world contains a clock, With pace commensurate to our desires, Propelled by other force than Stygian fire's; Shall we be driven hence to leave a place For these, who bring upon our stream disgrace: The rush, the roar, the stench, the smoke, the steam, The nightmare striking through our heavenly dream; The scream as shrill and hateful to the ear As when a peacock vents his rage and fear; Which churn to fury all a glassy reach, And heave rude breakers on a pebbly beach: Which half o'erwhelm with waves our frailer craft, While graceless shop-boys chuckle fore and aft: Foul water-toadstools, noisome filth-stained shapes, Fit only to be manned by dogs and apes: Blots upon nature: scars that mar her smile: Obscene, obtrusive, execrable, vile? Pall Mall Gazette, June, 1891. To B. H. H. (On his travels). And will thy travels never end? And wilt thou not return, my friend? Shall Piccadilly never more, Amid the busses' daily roar, Where prowls the Baron's stately goat, Thy philosophic footfall note? Nor ever will the Savile's board The dainties of the hour afford To one grave form amid the Babel Which girds that lofty-minded table? Come: for we miss thee. That slow smile Has failed us now too long a while: That network of ingenious phrase Suggesting more than what it says: The literary epigram Which gracefully unmasks a sham, Or else awards judicious praise To one who earns but wears not bays, Are lacking in our midst, and we Drift, rudderless, about a sea Of conversation unadorned By him whose absence long we've mourned. Come: for I need you: more or less Because I love to play at chess; Partly because I want to know Your views about a book or so, Which I have published, or intend To publish: most of all, my friend, Because I found thy converse sweet, Thy fellowship a joy complete, And life is short and art is long, And still the absent suffer wrong. I know not where thy footsteps stray, Nor what the ordering of thy day: If now thy graceful shallop slips Amid the gorgeous Eastern ships, Where some vast river makes a lane Across the forest-hidden plain: If, stretched upon a soft divan, You lounge, as orientals can, And trace the rings of fragrant smoke One graceful moment soar unbroke; While, lo, the wordless Kitmagar Presents the welcome waterjar, And swart Chuprassis stand at ease, Beneath umbrageous banyan trees: If now perchance the crescent moon Hangs high, at night's reposeful noon, Against a gloomy purple sky, Star-studded in its majesty, While slow you walk alone, and deep In thoughts that bring more rest than sleep. Come, anyhow: if not to find An occupation to thy mind, Nor yet a Fortunatus' purse, Nor any cure for any curse: Come, talk, live, marry, work, write, sing; Be eloquent on anything: Be active in whatever line: And if a sun less splendid shine, And vegetation less profuse, And persons worthier of abuse, Are found with us than now with you; Still, though our merits may be few, We are at least thy friends of youth, Thy fellow-seekers after truth, Thy fellow-talkers, fellow-bards, Thy fellows still in all regards; So turn again towards the West, And grasp their hands who love you best. Trident, June, 1891. A Parodist's Apology. If I've dared to laugh at you, Robert Browning, 'Tis with eyes that with you have often wept: You have oftener left me smiling or frowning, Than any beside, one bard except. But once you spoke to me, storm-tongued poet, A trivial word in an idle hour; But thrice I looked on your face and the glow it Bore from the flame of the inward power. But you'd many a friend you never knew of, Your words lie hid in a hundred hearts, And thousands of hands that you've grasped but few of Would be raised to shield you from slander's darts. For you lived in the sight of the land that owned you, You faced the trial, and stood the test: They have piled you a cairn that would fain have stoned you: You have spoken your message and earned your rest. Pall Mall Gazette, June, 1891. A Sonnet. Two voices are there: one is of the deep; It learns the storm-cloud's thunderous melody, Now roars, now murmurs with the changing sea, Now bird-like pipes, now closes soft in sleep: And one is of an old half-witted sheep Which bleats articulate monotony, And indicates that two and one are three, That grass is green, lakes damp, and mountains steep: And, Wordsworth, both are thine: at certain times Forth from the heart of thy melodious rhymes, The form and pressure of high thoughts will burst: At other timesâgood Lord! I'd rather be Quite unacquainted with the A. B. C. Than write such hopeless rubbish as thy worst. Granta, June, 1891. To a Lady. A pipe's a merry madrigal, A stately sonnet a cigar, The homely clay at close of day A stanza to the evening star, The cigarette a canzonette Both amorous and musical. But as the song requires an air, A madrigal must aptly rhyme, A sonnet shines in measured lines, Each foot must walk in proper time, And music's aid is best displayed When duly matched with verses fair: So sweetest meerschaum needs a case, Cigars are clipped with dainty blade, The seasoned briar will still aspire To lights in silvern casket laid, The cigarette is duly set In holder rich with every grace. And every cigarette consumed Is fragrant homage offered thee; The mellow streak, from week to week, Embrowns thy gift bestowed on me:â So every hour proclaims the power Of her whose gift the smoke perfumed. June 27, 1891. Regrets. A Roundel. You would not hear me speak; you never knew, Will never know, the eloquence unique It was my purpose to bestow on you; You would not hear me speak. Dear! it was no caprice, or idle freak: Perhaps I did not even mean to woo: My meaning was not very far to seek: I might have gained the end I had in view; I might have failed, since words are often weak; It never can be settled now: adieu! You would not hear me speak. Granta, June, 1891. June 19, 1891. All in a peaceful garden fair, One night in leafy June, There sat a wondrous lovely pair, And waited for the Moon, In silence, save where rustled by A little creeping breeze, Which swept the cobwebs from the sky, And scarcely stirred the trees. The one displayed in form and face To all and sundry comers The sweet accumulated grace Of twenty happy summers. The other, matronly and calm, Was most divinely fair, And each was stately as a palm, And each had pale gold hair. Between them, where a trailing bough Obscured the moonlight pale, Lounged a vast form with classic brow, Unquestionably male. There rose a mighty yellow Moon, Across the tree-tops peering Along the fleecy sky of June, Through which she'll soon be steering. And when she saw each lovely maid She clapped her silver hands; âSuch wondrous charms are rareâ she said âIn all sublunar lands. âBut which is fairest?â long and loud She shouted to the stars, Which glittered in a golden crowd, Like newly lit cigars. Then from the zenith Vega slid, And red Aldebaran Rushed up the sky, as he was bid, To meet the stately Swan; And many dozen more appeared, Till all the sky was bare, And round the Satellite careered, And vowed the scene was fair. Then spake the Moon: âI'm sore distressed: âTwo beauteous forms I see: âI can't say which I like the best: âDecide the point for me. âSuch foolish puzzles, I declare, âI hold in much abhorrence: âSay if the lovelier of the pair âBe A? or F?.â Then peeping o'er each other's head, The striking scene to scan, The Stars unanimously said:â âWe much prefer the Man.â To A. H. C. (In recollection of certain debates on the futility of Metaphysics.) You taunt me as a shallow man: You mock my prosy middle age: Would demonstrate me, if you can, Devoid of youth's exalted rage Bound on a dusty pilgrimage. Because I do not much peruse The words that Schopenhauer penned; Locke's, Kant's and Hegel's lofty views I don't aspire to comprehend; Because, in short, my worthy friend, I'm, like yourself, a man of prose: A man of commonplace belief, Who doubts, and disbelieves, and knows, And aims at joy, and flies from grief, And has a taste for beer and beef. You do us wrong: for you and I Are just as good as other men: A hand to write, a seeing eye, An ear which catches, now and then, The sounds that haunt a poet's pen: I offer (you withhold them) thanks For these, and other common things: And not in vain on Cam's green banks We lived at Trinity and King's, And loved to try our sprouting wings. A many-windowed house is life, And out of every window we, In intervals of daily strife, Look forth upon infinity: And that's the good of you and me. The joys of metaphysic trance, The midnight bliss of keen debate, The insight of a mystic's glance, Which charm the undergraduate, Are matched in our maturer state. The deeds and passions of our prime, Our studies of acknowledged truth, Our businessâthough it's not sublime,â Are just as excellent in sooth, As all the fervour lost with youth. The ruddy warmth of arduous toil, The spasm of triumphant strife, A friend to serve, a foe to foil, A cause with noble purpose rife, The love of her that gave thee life: The smile that shines through misty tears, The soft âdelight of low replies,â The after-glow of vanished fears, And all the excellent surprise That trembles in a woman's eyes: Men, women, children: speech and song: The artist's touch, the poet's thought: The pulses of a busy throng, The rest of spirits over-wrought: Are theseâis all beside them, naught? Here, everywhere, and every day, The seeker finds right human stuff: To laugh, to weep, to work, to play; Are joy and sorrow not enough? And cannot these content thee, Clough? June, 1891. To My Readers. I do not boast a poet's bays, Nor claim to wield a poet's pen, Nor do I hope for many days To buzz about the mouths of men. I claim to be the sort of man Who studies metrical effect: Whose verses generally scan: Whose rhymes are commonly correct; And when I chance upon a thought Which seems to shape itself in rhyme, I like to treat it as I ought, Unless the theme be too sublime. It may be pleasure to rehearse, When twilight deepens out of day, The tinkle of a tiny verse Which wiled the noon-tide hours away. It may be pleasure to recall The friends of yesterday to-morrow But that's a pleasureâif at allâ Which borders very near on sorrow. So, if I try to make you laugh, Or if I chance to make you weep, Your comrade when you crunch and quaff, Your solace when you cannot sleep; It's merely as a common man Who says what other people say, And hopes to end as he began, A treader of the beaten way. June, 1891.</field>
