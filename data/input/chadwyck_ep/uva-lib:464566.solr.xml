[The Flye she sat in Shamble row] [1] The Flye she sat in Shamble row, And shambled with, her heeles I trow. And then came in sir Cranion, with legs so long and many a one. 2 And said Ioue speede Dame Flye, Dame Flye, marry you be welcome good Sir quoth she: The Master humble Bee hath sent me to thee, to wit and if you will his true loue be. 3 But shee said nay, that may not be, for I must haue the Butterflye: For and a greater Lord there may not be. But at the last consent did shee. 4 And there was bid to this wedding, all Flyes in the field and Wormes creeping: The Snaile she came crawling all ouer the plaine, with all her ioly trinckets at her traine. 5 Tenne Bees there came all clad in Gold. and all the rest did them behold: But the Thonbud refused this sight to see. and to a Cow-plat away flyes shee. 6 But where now shall this wedding be? for and hey nonny no in an old Iue tree: And where now shall we bake our bread? for and hey nony no in an old horse head. 7 And where now shall wee brew our Ale? but euen within one Walnut shale: And also where shall we our dinner make, but euen vpon a galde Horse backe. 8 For there wee shall haue good companie, with humbling and bumbling and much melody: When ended was this wedding day the Bee hee tooke his flye away., 9 And laid her downe vpon the Marsh, betweene one Marigold and one long grasse: And there they begot good master Gnat, and made him the heire of all, that's flat. [Wee be Souldiers three] [1] Wee be Souldiers three, Pardona moy ie vous an pree, Lately come forth of the low country, with neuer a penny of mony. Fa la la la lantido dilly. 2 Here Good fellow I drinke to thee, Pardona moy ie vous an pree: To all good Fellowes where euer they be, with neuer a penny of mony. 3 And he that will not pledge me this, Pardona moy ie vous an pree: Payes for the shot what euer it is, with neuer a penny of mony. 4 Charge it againe boy, charge it againe, Pardona moy ie vous an pree: As long as there is any incke in thy pen with neuer a penny of mony. [By Lands-dale hey ho, by mery Lands-dale] [1] By Lands-dale hey ho, by mery Lands-dale, there dwelt a iolly miller, and a very good old man was he, hey ho, he had, he had and a sonne a, 2 He had, he had and a sonne a, men called him Renold, and mickle of his might was he, was he, hey ho. 3 And from his father a wode a, his fortune for to seeke, from mery Landsdale wode he, wode he, hey ho. 4 His father would him seeke a, and found him fast a sleepe. among the leaues greene was he, was he, hey ho. 5 He tooke, he tooke him vp a, all by the lilly white hand, and set him on his feet, and bad him stand, hey ho. 6 He gaue to him a benbow, made all of a trusty tree, and Arrowes in his hand and bad him let them flee. 7 And shoote was that that a did a, some say he shot a mile, but halfe a mile and more was it was it, hey ho. 8 And at the halfe miles end, there stood an armed man, this childe he shot him through, and through, and through, hey hoy. 9 His beard was all on a white a, as white as Whale is bone, his eyes they were as cleare, as Christall stone, hey ho. 10 And there of him they made good yeoman Robin hood, Scarlet, and little Iohn, and little Iohn, hey ho.

Shall we goe daunce the round? and shall we goe daunce the round? And he that is a bully boy, come pledge me on the ground. 2 We care not for those martiall men, that doe our states disdaine: But we care for those Marchant men, which doe our states maintaine. 3 To them we daunce this round, a round to them we dance this round: And he that is a bully boy, come pledge me on the ground.
