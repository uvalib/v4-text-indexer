Volume I Poems Descriptive of Rural Life and Scenery and other poems A RUSTIC'S PASTIME, IN LEISURE HOURS; J CLARE. Some like to laugh their time away, To dance while pipes or fiddles play, And have nae sense of ony want As lang as they can drink or rant. The rattling drum or trumpets tout Delight young swankies that are stout; May i be happy in my lays, Is all my wish; well pleas'd to sing Beneath a tree, or by a spring. RAMSAY. A Collection of Trifles In verse By John Clare of Helpstone Some like to laugh their time away, To dance while pipes &amp; fiddles play, And have nae sence of ony want As lang as they can drink &amp; rant. The rattling Drum &amp; trumpets tout Delight youn Swankies that are stout: May I be happy in my lays. And win a Lasting Wreath of Bays! Is a' my wish well pleasd to sing Beneath a tree or by a Spring. Ramsay SUMMER EVENING The sinken sun is takin leave &amp; sweetly gilds the edge of eve While purple [clouds] of deepening dye Huddling hang the western skye Crows crowd quaking oever head Hastening to the woods to bed Cooing sits the lonly dove Calling home her abscent love Kirchip Kirchip mong the wheat Partridge distant partridge greet Beckening call to those that roam Guiding the squandering covey home Swallows check their rambling flight &amp; twittering on the chimney light Round the pond the martins flirt Their snowy breasts bedawbd in dirt While the mason neath the slates Each morter bearing bird awaits Untaught by art each labouring spouse Curious daubs his hanging house Bats flit by in hood &amp; cowl Thro the barn hole pops the owl From the hedge the beetles boom Heedless buz &amp; drousy hum Haunting every bushy place Flopping in the labourers face Now the snail has made his ring &amp; the moth with snowy wing Fluttering plays from bent [to bent] Bending down with dews besprent Circles round in winding whirls, Through sweet evening's sprinkled pearls, On each nodding rush besprent; Dancing on from bent to bent: Then on resting branches hing Stren[g]th to ferry oer the spring Playful still his hours to keep, Till his time has come to sleep; In tall grass, by fountain head, Weary then he drops to bed. From the hay cocks moistend heaps Frogs now take their Vaunting leaps &amp; along the shaven mead Quickly travelling the[y] proceed Flying from their speckled sides Dewdrops bounce as grass divides Now the blue fog creeps along, And the bird's forgot his song: Flowrets sleeps within their hoods Daisys button into buds From soiling dew the butter cup Shuts his golden jewels up &amp; the Rose &amp; wood bine they Wait again the smiles of day Neath the willows wavy boughs Nelly singing milks her cows While the streamlet bubling bye Joins in murmuring melody Now the hedger hides his bill &amp; with his faggot climbs the hill Driver Giles wi rumbling joll &amp; blind ball jostles home the roll Whilom Ralph for doll to wait Lolls him oer the pasture gate Swains to fold their sheep begin Dogs bark loud to drive em in Plough men from their furrowy seams Loose the weary fainting team Ball wi cirging lashes weald Still so slow to drive afield Eager blundering from the plough Wants no wip to drive him now At the stable door he stands Looking round for friendly hands To loose the door its fastening pin Ungear him now &amp; let him in Round the Yard a thousand ways The beest in expectation gaze Tugging at the loads of hay As passing fotherers hugs away &amp; hogs wi grumbling deafening noise Bother round the server boys &amp; all around a motly troop Anxious claim their suppering up From the rest a blest release Gabbling goes the fighting geese Waddling homward to their bed In their warm straw litterd shed Nighted by unseen delay Poking hens tha[t] loose their way Now within the hovel flies Slumbering there [the foxes prize] Now the cat has ta'en her seat, With her tail curl'd round her feet; Patiently she sits to watch Sparrows fighting on the thatch Dogs lick their lips &amp; wag their tails When doll brings in the milking pails With stroaks &amp; pats their welcomd in &amp; they with looking thanks begin She dips the milk pail brimming oer &amp; hides the dish behind the door Prone to mischief boys are met Gen the heaves the ladders set Sly they climb &amp; softly tread To catch the sparrow on his bed &amp; kill em O in cruel pride Knocking gen the ladderside Cursd barbarions pass me by Come not turks my cottage nigh Sure my sparrows are my own Let ye then my birds alone Sparrows come from foes severe Fearless come yere welcome here My heart yearns for fates like thine A sparrows lifes as sweet as mine To my cottage then resort Much I love your chirping note Wi my own hands to form a nest Ill gi ye shelter peace &amp; rest Oh quick desert each pilfering boy Ere they your little life destroy O woud they meet some mysery Some foe as bad as they're to thee Shoud rogues disturb their waking dream How hard how cruel woud it seem Forcd from theer beds their rest resign &amp; take their lives as they do thine What pains woud rack those hearts forlorn That now'd be laughing them to scorn Trifling are the deed[s] ye do Grait the pains ye undergo Cruel man woud Justice serve Their crueltys as they deserve &amp; justest punishment pursue &amp; do as they to others do Ye mourning chirpers fluttering here They woud no doubt be less severe Tho ye pluck the farmer[s] wheat Hunger forces all to eat Foolhardy clown neer grudg[e] the wheat Which hunger forces them to eat Your blinded eyes worst foes to you Neer see th[e] good which sparrows do Did not the sparrows watching round Pick up the inscet from your grounds Did not they tend your rising grain You then might sow—to reap in vain Thus providence when understood Her end &amp; aim is doing good Sends nothing here without its use Which Ign'rance loads with its abuse Thus fools despise the blessing sent &amp; mocks the givers good intent O god let me the best pursue As Id have other[s] do to me Let me the same to others do &amp; learn at least Humanity Dark &amp; darker glooms the sky Sleep gins close the labourers eye Dobson on his greensward seat Where neighbours often neighbour meet Of c[r]ops to talk &amp; work in hand &amp; battle News from foreign land His last wift hes puffing out &amp; Judie putting to the rout Who gossiping takes great delight To shool her nitting out at night Jingling newsing bout the town Spite o dobs disliking frown And many a thing, her evil eye Can see they don't come honest by. Chattering at her neighbours door The summons warns her to give oer Prepar'd to start, she soodles home, Her knitting twirling o'er her thumb, Leaveing th'unfinishd tale in pain Soon as evening comes again Wi Apron folded oeer her arms The tale so fraught wi lieings charms So loath to leave afraid to stay She bawls her story all the way And in the cottage gangs with dread, To meet old Dobson's timely frown, Who grumbling sits, prepar'd for bed, While she stands chelping 'bout the town. Night winds now on sutty wings In the cotters chimney sings Sweet I raise my drowsy head Thoughtful stretching on my bed Listning to their ushering charms That shakes the Elm trees mossy arms Yet still I love my lonley watch to keep While all the drowsy world are lost in sleep In soft Slumbers till they stronger creep Then rockd by winds I fall to sleep SOMTHING NEW How varying is the taste of man Still eager to pursue That ever pleasing novelty In meeting somthing new In infancy the rage begins (So tempting is the view) Babes throw aside their once lov'd things To sigh for somthing new The hoop to day which boys are seen So eager to pursue To morrow lies a toy despis'd Exchang'd for somthing new Young miss's (if not catch'd in time) —Be lovers ere so true Grow fickle tires &amp; turns 'em off To seek for somthing new Old maids whom every hope forsakes The self same end pursue &amp; put their wrinkl'd mouths in form To look for somthing new E'en wives—but hasty muse for bear (Tho wives shou'd have their due) Will often harbour evil thoughts &amp; wish for somthing new Lawers &amp; doctors each in turn One common aim pursue When one good job is finish'd they Look out for somthing new Poor victim poets vainly priz'd By the diserning few Still ryhme in hopes o' better days &amp; dwell on somthing new —Ah shatter'd coat &amp; wanted groat When wil't be mine to view? Thee thrown aside? &amp; pockets lin'd With hopefull somthing new —Booksellers often miss the chance Their customers pursue When throwing usless books about They search for somthing new Tho fashions change with every day Their votaries will pursue Come as they will or fast or slow They cry is ‘somthing new’ So Gentlemen &amp; ladies here (In hopes to meet his due) A humble clown exerts his skill To offer somthing new He wishes every taste to please &amp; hopes to find it true So good or bad or what they will This “Trifles'” somthing new [No hailing curry favouring tothers] No hailing curry favouring tothers Muses gins my story Blunt—as when ones wrongd by another I fling my case before ye &amp; curse the hour ye weigling Witches Your weiglings ere got round me &amp; wish I had been dead ye bitches Ere ye a Jingling found me That evil day I came your laky &amp; laugh stock for a century When vain subscriptions fussd poor Jacky To 'pear among the gentry When thrown aside my spade &amp; pickers Wi vain aspiring spirit I left my mates wopstraws &amp; diggers &amp; fancied I had merit But yourns the fault ye blinking bitches (The Lord a'mighty bless us) To fancy one that dug in ditches Might work on mount parnassus Thus as twas you that wispering said it &amp; well enough you knew it I might come in for fame &amp; credit If Id stick up for poet I was contented wit while earning A shilling mong my neighbours Unknown to books unknown to learning &amp; peace then crownd my labours ON MR ? LOCKING UP THE PUBLIC PUMP To lock up Water—must undoubted stand Among the Customs of a Christian land An Action quite Uncommon and unknown Or only practic'd in this place alone A Thing unheard of yet in Prose or Rhyme And only witness'd at this present time —But some there is—a stain to Christian Blood That cannot bear to do a Neighbour good —No!—to be kind and use another well With them's a torment ten times worse then hell Such Fiends as these whose charity wornt give The begging Wretch a single chance to live —Who to nor Cats nor Dogs one crumb bestows Who even grut[c]h the droppings of their Nose —Its my Opinion of such Marngrel curs Whom Nature scorns to own and Man abhors That could they find a f?t of any use They'd even burst before they'd set it loose! LINES WRITTEN WHILE VIEWING SOME REMAINS OF AN HUMAN BODY IN LOLHAM LANE Sure t'was the murderers hand that laid thee low And with the ponderous club or dredful knife Or such like weapon struck the deadley blow And rob'd thy body of its precious life Nay it might not be so:— Perhaps these mangled bones When they was blest with life tho long ago Hath trac'd sweet musick thro her highest tones Perhaps a genious powerful and strong Well skill'd in all the majesty of song Dwelt in this dust—and this his wish to have His bone inter'd in this sequester'd spot— Vain roving thought—what this a poets grave And not one record left—but all forgot What such reward? If thou had eloquence What thou a bard? And this thy recompence Sure this cant be—howe're as nothing's shown All these congecterings are but idly vain Thy fate thy fame a like to me unknown And all my searching fruitless to obtain Yet he that governs all And earth and air and sky He knew thy death and end—he saw thy fall And when and where for he is ever nigh And if some impious ruffian laid the[e] low If he or they it was that gave the blow They will appear on that tremenduos day When the redeemer comes to judge the land Then will they all their guilty crimes display Without disguise—and first that bloody hand Then is their fate prepar'd For this their vile offence Then will they get their just reward And thou thy recompence LINES TO BATH Ye waters fam'd the ills of life to heal Know what a son does for a Father feel. He near worn out with the rumatic pain Oft sought relief alas but sought in vain Is now repairing to your healing wave In hopes that it may be the means to save. If so as now you do that charge retain If so as now he's safe upon thy shore If so as now thou cannot ease his pain Send him save back—and I desire no more. THE FLOWER POTT or Morrality and Reflection On a fine sunday morning the house swep so clean And a flower pot for ornament plac'd Compos'd of oak branches so spreading and green Intermingled with blue-bells the window-board grac'd. To view their gay colors I rather inclin'd While resting myself near the wall Which soon brought morality into my mind And thus I had model'd their fall. ‘Tho your charms seem so tempting ye gay blooming flowers ‘As to make every stranger look on ‘Yet if I stay here three or four passing hours ‘I shall see you all whither'd and gone!’ But afterwards thinking on what I had said Reflection soon made me to sigh And once more reviewing their sweet smelling shade I suppos'd from the flowers this reply. ‘Vain unthinking mortal how ready thou'rt prone ‘To condemn the short date of our flowers ‘But stop with thy morals—turn the case to thine own! ‘And thou'l find it a deal worse than our's.’ ‘For go where thou pluck't us next year o'er the ground ‘There thou'lt find us as gay as before! ‘But when once moralizer thy spring's gone its round ‘It never will blossom no more!’ FAREWELL TO A THICKETT Dear blooming wild your shades and all Are so Familliar grown That in my rapture I do call Your lonley scenes my own Wildness I love—and loath to part From shades so wild as you To leave lies heavy at my heart But I must bid adieu. Nor can thy bower's romantic twine As if by faireys wove My melancholly breast incline To settle in your grove For know ye shades tis love that calls Tis love that does subdue 'Tis love which now my heart enthralls And makes me bid adieu. But couldst thou boast within thy bower Of shrubs so rudely drest One single twining branch or flower By my dear So[ph]y prest O! then it would such thoughts convey Of love erewhile so true That I could sit from day to day And never bid adieu! ROBIN AND SUKE or The Midnight QuarrelA Ballad It thunder'd loud—the clock struck nine And pitchy darkness come Poor frighted suke began to whine For Robin worn't got home No friendly moon to lend her light He's all in darkness crost Then who could think in such a night But what he would be lost She rocks her chair and sobs and cries In a despairing plight The dying fire neglected lies A mellancholy sight And oft she ventures in the street Amid the dark profound And often thinks she hears his feet Along the unseen ground But ah! these fancied thoughts were vain No robin yet was nigh She shuts the hated door again And heaves a mournful sigh ‘He's surely lost or else I think ‘He would'n't stop thus late ‘Unless the nasty vaporing drink ‘Has settled in his pate’ ‘If so I hope he's sence enough ‘To shun that lonley park ‘The footpads are so wildley rough ‘And more so in the dark’ ‘Besides them fishponds black and deep ‘Lie just beside the road ‘O! if the precious moon could peep ‘It would be well bestow'd’ Such are the might be doubts and fears That haunt the troubl'd breast And his past conduct fresh appears Which makes her more distrest But hope that name which all invokes Brought notions much more free ‘Perhaps’ she cries ‘theres other folks ‘About as well as he’ Thus consolated from despair By hopes assistance blest She sits down in her old low chair To make herself at rest But when a mind is once distres't What trifles will renew A dreadful owl when all at rest Near to her window flew It shriek't how horrid was the tone Especially to her She sigh'd and cried ‘by this I'm shown ‘That worse things will occur’ Again what hopeles doubts and fears Disturb her troubl'd breast Again that dreaded park appears In horrors mantle drest In the dark wood she see's him stand Prest with contending strife Distinct she hears the rogues demand ‘Your money or your life’ Frighted to death with thoughts like these All hopes away she threw Vain as they where nought could appease Now she believ'd them true The fire gone out and tinder damp She mourn'd her troubles sore But ere she struck a rough-hew'd stamp Spoke something near the door She listn'd strict it stamp't anew And then began to cough By this last sighn full well she knew The lost man worn't far off Yet 'stead of joy as one would think The blood boild in her veins For still the ‘fishponds’ and the ‘drink’ Perplex'd her crazy brains ‘I'll warrant him I'll learn him how ‘To stop again thus late ‘And surely if he fronts me now ‘He'll get a broken pate’ Her muttering's stopt—the door went clench He's com'd in sight almost No sooner in but—‘well my wench ‘Didn't ya think me lost’ So soft so greeting was the tone So civil who could blame Yet his old nasty forked joan Could not return the same ‘Think ya lost not I indeed ‘There's no such luck as that ‘Would it where so I should be free'd ‘—But I must bear my lot’ He heard (besure) yet hadn't caught To where they did refer For poor old boy he little thought How matters stood with her ‘“Luck to be lost” ‘bless us’ thinks he ‘This must be something odd ‘And “bear my lot” what can it be? ‘That knocks agen her nodd’ Thus thought he to himself why not Yet still he was to seek ‘Luck to be lost’ and ‘bear my lot’ To him appeard as greek The case stood thus—(which soon will show That cottering suke thought wrong) T'was clipping time and then you know A shepherds in full throng His own sheep left—for he was loth To loose this lov'd employ And as he could not do 'em both He fors't to hire a boy But still he took a great delight About his flock to con And always whent that way at night To see how they got on So as he whent his usual round On this unlucky night Suprising change when near the ground No flock appear'd in sight Vext to the quick he went away Nor stood awhile to doubt But quickly call'd to poor old trey ‘Boy we must find em out’ Oer hill and dale they went that night Thro many a neighbouring ground At last a shepherd set them right And pointed to the pound At hearing this good story oer Joy glow'd within his breast His fears and doubts was then no more All troubl'd thoughts had rest The boy still lost—but this you see Could not fresh griefs begin For 'bout such idle rouge's as he He never car'd a pin And now the cause which made him late Is plump and plainly shown We'el turn the tale to Robins fate And visit noisey joan Who murmur'd much and shook her head But as a Fox more sly He patiently heard all she said And never made reply T'was droll to see the old boy sit His nose straight looking down With broad brim'd hat turnd up to fitt That scarce could boast a Crown He seemd a dad of ancient taste In such a antique barge With great coat belted round his waist And buckles monstrous large But in describing coat and hat We still loose sight of home For in a ballad rightly pat Digressions ne'er should come Therefore with these descriptive things In future we'l be dumb But turn where scolding musick rings With never ceasing hum Suke when she did forsee with all Her scolding to affright That Bob who never spoke a't'all Would gain the Vic'try quite Turn'd to a more majestic tone With railings not to seek That might torment a very stone Or urge the dumb to speak ‘Ah! thou poor degected sight ‘Disgraceful quite to men ‘Do what I would to keep the[e] tight ‘My labour provd in vain’ ‘But yah may mend yar rags ya sen ‘For Ive no more to do ‘And where ya have been go agen ‘With all yar trumpery too’ ‘That coat I bought the rogue one fair ‘No other was so stout ‘Tis but nine year since I declare ‘And now its quite wore out’ ‘Its all in vain—hes such a stroy ‘Buy hose or what I will ‘Just like a young and ramping boy ‘Hes always wanting still’ ‘Ah!—(and shook her head) thou ragged ruff ‘Thy conduct grieves me sore ‘But I'm determin'd thats enough ‘To rap and rend no more’ Thus she whent on in railing wad Which provd succesful too For Robin grew so wonderous mad He knew not what to do Wether to speak or still keep mute He knew not which to try But buying ‘coats’ would never suit That forc'd him to reply ‘Ya poor old silly prating fool ‘Ya make me call ya so ‘Whor I a boy that went to school ‘More power ya cou'dn't show’ ‘Thou buy me coats and this and that ‘Why thou'rt a funny duke ‘That love's to hear thy ownself chat ‘Who finds the Money suke?’ ‘There lies the point—is't ya or I?

To see the sun rise thro the skirts of the wood In his mantle so lovley and red It cheers up my spirits and does me much good As thro the cold stubbles I tred. Tho not that his beams more advances the scene Or adds to the Landscape a charm But all that delights me by him may be seen That the ensuing hours will be warm. And this with the poet as yet in the world In a parrarel sence will comply For when he does view the gay scenes there unfurl'd Tis only to light him on high. SONG [Since Flora disdains me—her once loving swain] Since Flora disdains me—her once loving swain Forever I'le cease to adore And leave the[e] my Tray with this crook on the plain In quest of some pleasenter shore. Lo! the vales once so charming no more appear gay Since she does my prescence despise For if she but sees me oer the hill far-away Quik down in the valley she flies. To withstand this contempt in a maiden so cruel Resolution itself is in vain And her once seeming kindness returns with fresh fuel That serves to rekindle my pain. What must be the reason—to me is unknown Not a fortnight can tell of the change Since she us'd to call ‘the fond shepherd her own’ And wherever I pleasd she would range. T'was then when the best smelling flowrets so fair That grew in the meadow or grove I culled—and wove in fresh wreaths for her hair Which she falsely repaid me with love. But these past illusions are never to ease Nor serve me my folly to blind So I'le seek for soft pleasures ne'er failing to please And erase the false maid from my mind.

[Behind the far woods lowly sunk was the sun] Behind the far woods lowly sunk was the sun Scarce a streak could be seen in the west All the horison round was encircl'd wi' dun And Owls ere and there with their hoopings begun And Crows where all flocking to rest When Ra[l]ph on the road from the fair once again Had seven long miles for to go And now these sad omens appeard but too plain And this way &amp; that way he turnd &amp; again He hopd that it couldnt be so THE PISMIRE Thou little insect infinitely small What curious texture marks thy minute frame How seeming large thy foresight and withall Thy labouring tallents not unworthy fame To raise such monstrous hills along the plain Largher than mountains when compar'd with thee To drag the crumb dropt by the village swain Thrice bigger than thy self—is strange indeed to me But that great instinct which foretells the cold And bids 'em gard 'gainst winters wasteful power Endues this mite with cheerfulnes to hold Her toiling labours thro the sultry hour So that same soothing power of Misery Cheers the poor Pilghrim to Eternity! SONG [Fast by a Brook beneath a bending willow] Fast by a Brook beneath a bending willow Where shrubs surounding in a roomy glade While yellow king cups form'd a golden pillow Seeming retirement! blest with cooling shade. To shun the heat fair Florimella came Nor thought what harm such lonley shades might bring But carlesly lay down—and soon her flame Was lulld to slumber by the purling spring. Without the bower her crook neglected lay While favorite Rover tended it so true These where the only things that did betray For Collin saw them and away he flew! Void of all fear he sought her snowey charms Where a loose robe display'd her panting breast Eager he claspt her in his clownish arms And soon his longing wickedness had rest. She tho unconscious of her undone fate Startled suppris'd from feelings new begun Alas! poor girl her slumbers broke too late Since virgin sweetnes Beautys all was gone! Be this a Caution then to all fair maids That still can boast their maidenheads so pure Nor trust like florimel to sleep in shades However seeming lonley or secure!

SONG [‘If Kittys rosy presence now] ‘If Kittys rosy presence now ‘Should chance to bless my sight ‘Again the oft repeated vow ‘She'd witness with delight ‘Again the church again the spire ‘Would promt her bosom with desire ‘But O sweet kitt spurn not delay ‘Time will bring the promis'd day.’ Thus sung the poor enarmourd swain As labouring along Echo viebrating catch'd the strain And brought him back the song Again the rocks again the plains In mellower sound repeat the strains Till all in chorus roundelay Join and sing the ‘promisd day.’ THE WISH If wishes could be gaind and I might have What ere of worldly things I lik'd to crave Such as would free me from all labouring strife And make me happy to the end of life, In doing this I'de take the surest plan To bind contentment with the future man; And first if wishing could such pleasure give, I'de chuse a descent house wherein to live. The spot should be beneath a neighbouring hill Fronting the south close to a winding rill; As other cots the plan both wide and long With walls made roughly durable and strong, One outward door might all my needs suffice Tho' in such trifles I should not be nice. Of british oak the roofing should be made And best of slate should be upon them lade, I would chuse slate tho thatch is my desire Because slate roofs will not so easy fire, Then when the outside wall and roof where lade Inside convenience should be nicely made, First room for a small cellar should be found Wholesome and cool but not made under ground; They serve to loose the fabrics weighty load And proves a harbour for the nuisom toad, Therefore it should be level with the rest Well stor'd with ale the oldest and the best On whose good cheering strength I might depend When making welcome with a trusty friend For lifes a drone where friendship has not part A utter stranger to the feeling heart. And next a pantry suitable indeed To store that nourishment we mostly need; With dairy joining where the brimming pale Demands a situation very swale, For this a window northward should be made With clumps of elder closley set to shade. Methinks thus far the things are so compleat They promise fair a comfortable seat. A noice small parlour too I should desire So well convinient for a winter fire For in that season larger rooms are cold Small ones are snuger as the less they hold, Hung round with little pictures it should be For these are trifles which I love to see, Near the fireside close fitted in the wall I'de have a nice made cubboard not too small Each shelf in breadth so uniformly pland That books in eightvo size or more might stand For this one use I'd have the cubboard made Where none but choisest authors should be laid, Such as Dermody Scott Macniel and Burn With rural Bloomfield Templeman and Hurn These are the authors that can boast the power Of giving raptures in a leisure hour, And tho I read some of them every night Their songs near fail of adding fresh delight. A descent Bed too here would surley prove A neat appendage for a winter stove Where daily living in't would make the air More warm and dry then emty chambers are; Now this would be compleat—but then I doubt A little kitchen can't be done without, Then this I'de have with coppers neatly hung, Likewise a oven closley arch'd and strong With other things nescesity would plan As shelves for dishes or a wellscour'd pan, But these are trifles which might soon be got, Two chambers now would just compleat my cot, In chusing these I'de ask no more than two They would be plenty quite and nicely do, The one wherein thro summer I might sleep The other should my orchards produce keep Yet both sho[u]ld boast a bed as one might be Useful for those that came to visit me, Of this there should be very little shown Tho friends and nearest kin I'd never cease to own But as my self they both alike should fare, And while it lasted might be welcome there. My chamber window should oer look the east That in delicious views my eyes might feast There girt with crimson see the morning sun Thro distant trees his journey just begun Still mounting every moment stages higher And as his height increases so the fire At other times succeeds the vapouring mist Hiding each object quite from east to west. While other mornings shine with pearly dews Then is the time to look for distant views. The Tree the Wood the Cot and distant Spire I would search after with a fond desire. In this said window too I would peruse Each sweet production of the rural muse While sparrows from the eves in chirping throng Should never fail to welcome with their song. And now the house is fram'd beyond excuse Wanting naught else but household goods for use: They should preserve one order all along Made roughly descent durable and strong For like to Pomfret I could n'er endure The needles pomp of gaudy furniture. What I should want few words may soon explain All that was useful nesessary plain These and no more would bound my ample choise And decorate my cot extreemly nice. And now a garden pland with nicest care Should be my next attention to prepare; For this I'd search the soil of different grounds Nor small nor great should mark its homley bounds: Between these two extreems the plan should be Compleat throughout and large enough for me; A strong brick wall should bound the outward fence Where by the suns allcheering influence Walltrees should flourish in a spreading row And Peach and Pear in ruddy lustre glow. A five foot bed should follow from the wall To look compleat or save the trees withall On which small seeds for sallading I'd sow While curl-leaf Parsley should for edges grow. My Garden in four quarters I'd divide To show good taste and not a gaudy pride; In this the middle walk should be the best Being more to sight exposed than the rest, At whose southend a harbour should be made So well belov'd in summer for its shade: For this the rose would do or jessamine With virginbower or the sweet woodbine, Each one of these would form exactly well A compleat harbour both for shade or smell. Here would I sit when leisure did agree To view the pride of summer scenery See the productions promis'd from my spade While blest with liberty and cooling shade. But now a spot should be reserv'd for flowers That would amuse me in those vacant hours When books and study cease their charms to bring And Fancy sits to prune her shatterd wing, Then is the time I'd view the flowrets eye And all loose stragglers with scotch-mattin tye; The borders too I'd clean with nicest care And not one smothering weed should harbour there: In trifling thus I should such pleasure know As nothing but such trifles could bestow. This charming spot should boast a charming place Southwardly plan'd my cottage front to grace. There a nice gras plat should attract the eye Mow'd every week more level then the dye. Ah! think how this would decorate the scene So fine a level and a finer green. My borders they should lie a little flue And rear the finest flowers that sip the dew The roses blush the lilies vying snow Should uniform their namles beauties show, With fine ranuncullus and jonquil fair That sweet perfumer of the evening air The scabious too so jocolatley dusk Should there be seen with tufts of smelling musk The woodbine tree should all her sweets unfurl Close to my door in many a wanton curl. Aside my wall the vine should find a place While damask roses did my window grace: And now a walk as was the plan before Exactly coresponding with the door Should lead my footsteps to another bower Whenever leisure gave the pleasent hour. But once again the greens delightful spot Should wear a ornament I quite forgot; A little pond within a circle laid It would look nice and might be useful made: The side with freestone should be walled round And steps the same to bevel with the ground. There sweet Nymphea lover of the tide Should deck my mimic pool with spangling pride. Oft would I seek the steps in midday hour When sol mounts high in full meredian power To see its leaves that on the surface lie Prove Boats of Pleasure to the dragon flye. Ah scenes so happy void of all controul Your seeming prospects heightens up my soul; E'en now so bright the fairy vision flies, I mark its flight as with possesing eyes But thats in vain—to hope the wish was gave It clogs the mind and binds the heart a slave. Tis nothing but a wish one vents at will Still vainly wishing and be wanting still For when a wishing mind enjoys the view He dont expect it ever will come true, Yet when he cherishes the pleasing thought He still keeps wishing till he wants for nought, And so will I—My eyes shall wander oer A Pleasent prospect, Acres just threescore, And this the measure of my whole domains Should be divided into woods and plains, O'er the fair plains should roam a single cow For not one foot should ever want the plough This would be toiling so I'd never crave One single thing where labour makes a slave. Tho health from exercise is said to spring Foolhardy toil that health will never bring. But 'stead of health—dire ills a numerous train Will shed their torments with afflictive pain. Be as it will I hold in spite of strife That health ne'er rises from a labouring life; Therefore the busines that such labour gave When I could do without I'd never have: All I would do should be to view my grounds And every morning take my daily rounds To see that all was right and keep secure the bounds: With trifling in the garden now and then Which finds employment for the greatest men Each coming day the labour should renew And this is all the labour I would do, The other hours I'd spend in letterd ease To read or study just as that might please, This is the way my plan of life should be Unmaried Happy in Contentment free. For he that's pester'd with a noisey wife Can neer enjoy that quietnes of life That does to life belong—Therefore I'd ne'er Let Hymen's torch within my cot appear. For all domestic needs that did require Womans assistance—I'd a servant hire She should be mistres of the whole conscern And what she could'n't do she soon might learn But this should be the character I'd seek Well made not proud her looks entirley meek Not fond—but witty nor unknown to books With mind entirley modest as her looks. That charming she that was adorn'd with these Could never fail in quietnes to please. And now my income which I have not made Should touch at living desent yearly paid, This would suffice me—for I'd never stride O'er scenes of descency to follow pride. A little over plus I might expend T'relieve a Beggar or to treat a friend For while I'd money left or bread to spare The Beggar always should be welcome there. Tho' this was all in wishing I would have Posses'd of these I nothing more should crave, Save when the worn out numbers of fourscore Had fix'd their standard on my grey grown shore Then one more wish should be the last I'd crave A Painless Exit to a welcome grave. [How welcome &amp; sweet is springs infant dawning] How welcome &amp; sweet is springs infant dawning The Elder as witness puts out her broad leaves The Robin sweet tutles his hymn to the morning &amp; sparrows are chirping their joy in the eaves O sweet shines the sun on the wakening morning O rich the young landscip his lustre displays &amp; sweet his first smile on the crocus flower dawning Whose borrowd pride shines dizend out in his rays EDWARD'S GRAVE When others, fearful of the Gloom, Their homeward path pursue, Fond sally seeks for Edwards tomb Her sorrows to renew. Where prayers of tenderness and love By pilgrims often heard Does court the angelic realms above Her lover to reward. Nor wizzards jump, nor gobblin tale, Nor mimic elfin sprite, Nor moping gost, nor spectre pale, Nay the most dismal night When hollow winds does wisstle thro The mournful cypress shade, When bent in howling rage the Yew— Can never fright the maid. No, no, her ever sorrowing mind Attach'd to grief so strong Does never listen to the wind, Nor heed the gobblin throng. Her sighs are urgh'd in heartfelt grief For Edwards haples fate, She seeks but cannot find relief All sorrow is too late. Alas! poor maid, thy Edwards dead And far beyond thy power; In vain thy low reclining head Bends down the sickly flower; He cannot hear, he cannot see, Pent low beneath the sod. Then rise, chear up from misery And leave his fate to God. MY LAST SHILLING O dismal disaster! O troublesome lot! What a heart rending theme for my musing Ive got Then pray whats the matter?

O rather than his fate bewail Praise his unerring choise And this thy present heroe hail With bold triumphing voice, He fights thy cause and will mantain Thy power triumphant on the main, Whoever dare to crave On Land or Sea where e'er he roves, Each Element a heroe proves, As skilful and as brave.

Poor Nap thinking to end the fight Rejoic'd in what was done And little thought that Nelsons night Could bring a Morning Sun. For had he knew that Englands shore Could boast one Gallant heroe more He'd surely curs'd that day That sent a Nelson to the skies And bid a Wellington arise From Nelson's pregnant Clay. TO THE MEMORY OF JAMES MERRISHAW A VILLAGE SCHOOLMASTER Remem'brance paints the scene of backward days Prompting my Mem'ry to begin the lays; But ah! a pause—the subject makes me grieve And sorrowing sadness bid my bosom heave. —Methinks the Muse in angry tone replys, ‘Clown, with thyself no more apologize, ‘Go search the churchyard were thy master lies, ‘There seek the friendless grave without a stone, ‘There find his mouldering dust that lies alone ‘Near where a bending walnut fans the grave ‘With sweeping branches “idly bid to wave” ‘There press the sod and muse upon the spot ‘That once had kindred now by all forgot, That once had learning worthy highest fame ‘Yet still liv'd friendless and to die the same ‘Think on all this—and tho more cold than clay ‘'T'will surley warm the[e] to begin the lay.’ —The Muse is right—I feel the kindling fire Of indignation and a fond desire; Ah! injur'd shade, this bosom felt for thee Tho it was absent in thy misery. I've often sought thy grave without a stone, I've often strove to make thy memory known, But all in vain—the spot was still unknown, The simple lay no sooner made than flown, My weak attempts seem'd all in vain to try; Declining weakness—all was born to die. But now I will attempt the promis'd lay, And tho rough language points the vulgar way It still shall boast this honorable part Of having its origin from the heart. Flattry shall never tempt my homley lays, I neither want reward nor yet the praise, Can only one succeed then alls repaid; —To snatch thy memory from oblivions shade, If in this single point my muse succeeds ‘T'will be the whole reward her labour needs. Ah! tho thy injur'd grave's without a stone And nothing left to make thy memory know[n] Tho no neglecting muse to force the tear Mourn'd one soft strain oer thy unnotic'd bier With me thy precious worth shall never die While life remains to aid the feeling sigh. O! then dear shade accept this rural lay A Pupil brings thy kindnes to repay. Tho weak his genious which would fain attone To make thy memory and thy virtues known, Tho mean the lay to what thy worth requires, ‘Yet naught is vain which gratitude inspires;’ Tis she that bids my artless muse pursue Her lowley flight and give the tribute due, Due to thy worth thy memory and thy grave, For thou it was dear injur'd man that gave This little learning which I now enjoy; A Gift so dear that nothing can destroy. Twas thou that taught my infant years to scan The various evils that encompas man, Thou Also taught my eager breast to shun Those vain pursuits where thousands are undone. And if such choise Examples I decline, Then shame belongs to me—the praise is thine. All this he's done for me—then ris[e] my soul Above the littlenes of lifes controul; Mind not what Booklearnt men or critics say, Thine is the debt and be it thine to pay Then muse arise—but first repeat the tone, ‘A friendless grave that lies without a stone.’ Here sons of Learning candidates for fame Whose Labouring toils a deathles merit claim; Here see the wreck that poverty regards A son of Learning yet theres no rewards. He who pursue'd that ardorous task to rear Young tender shoots to blossom and to bear And in that labour did so strictly rule As provd the man sufficient for a school He who so skilld in arts would yield to none And Science own'd him for her darling son On Music's farthest shore he'd safley land Touching her magic notes with powerful hand. Thro Mathematics hidden depths he'd pry, Trace all her windings with a skilful eye. And in Geometry his searching view Could draw a figure admirably true. Figures or symbols either at his will Would fetch the answer with uncommon skill. Either to sing or plan or write or read In each his powerful genius would succeed Now he where all this ellegance was shown ‘Lies mouldring in the grave without a stone.’ Ah! think on this ye sons to learning dear And on his fate bestow a single tear. Had he been rich possesing wealthy power Ah! then the scene as changeful as the hour Would turn another way—the flatt'rers verse Must sing his praises and his worth rehearse. His death would find the elegiac reed, And ‘Lines’ and ‘odes’ would numberles succeed. Granduer must now their once fine man reliefe A Herse to carry and a Coach to grieve. Next oer his grave the marbles taught to shine Exact in features animatley fine: And now the polishd muse must fondly give Her last adieu and bid his memory live. The verse must flourish round the collumns base Enrich'd with each good deed and namless grace, Such as perhaps he never did possess (For splendid basenes never fails address) Had he been rich this surley would be shown, But he was poor and poverty his own Which nipt his Genius on the learned stage And held his labours from a thankles age ‘Ah! think on this ye sons to learning dear’ ‘And on his fate bestow a single tear’ When press'd with poverty you muse alone, ‘Think on the friendles Grave without a stone.’ BEAUTY Beauty how changhing and how frail As skies in April showers Or as the summers minute gales Or as the morning flowers. As April skies so Beauty shades As Summer gales so Beauty flies As Morning flowers at Evening fades So Beautys tender Blossom dies! A CHARACTER Her hair bound in tortoise or else loosley flowing (Lo each is a beautiful show) More blacker than jet the fine ringlets seem glowing Nay they rival the Micaelmas sloe. Her face cloth'd in blushes like the east in a morning Sheds a lustre so healthful and gay And O! her sweet neck is with Cupids adorning More whiter than blossoms of May. Her beautiful bosom with love sweetly swelling Whould make e'en a Hermit to long And O! of her eyes and her lips theres no telling They'r out o' the reach of my song. Her height with the rest in exactest propotion Nought defective throughout can be seen And her fine limbs conceal'd will oft show their sweet motion When met by the wind on the green. Tho her form is so charmingly fine tall and slender It does not outrival her mind, She's equaly Modest Obliging and Tender That she seems for an angel designd. She also is Witty and quick in descerning, Nor a stranger to Helicon's spring, She's an able proficient in all sorts of Learning, To Draw or to Write or to sing. O! Cupid since thou with thy Bow fast pursuing Made an Arrow flie twang thro my heart Give me but this Maid I'll ne'er mourn the subduing, But bless the good aim of thy dart. THE POWERFUL SMILE Dead lies poor Collin murder'd by a frown Shot from the strong arm'd tower of Chloe's eye, The cruel dart did all his hopes uncrown, Pierc'd thro his heart—and made him seem to die. Yet spight of this—if oer his half-shut eyes Sweet Chloe deigns a magic smile to fling Instant emerging in a wild suprise From death to life fond Lazarus will spring. TO HOPE O Muse bestow—nor think it vain (While praise rebounds in just excess) To a weak clown one single strain, Fit and becoming hopes address, For O in every grief we find Her ready aid to cheer the mind. Hail soothing hope recruiting power In penitence and haples fate; Assistant proof in latest hour E'en thro the prisons gloomy grate Where Culprits almost hopless grieve Thy form will glimmer to reprieve. Thro life thus far—(so cloth'd in stains Of Motley troubles as it is) Me thou hast chear'd and still remains To point to shores of endless bliss, Tho doom'd perhaps another way Sweet hope endears the wisht essay. Thou balmy bland enlivner hail Or false or true to the distrest Thy form will dart in sorrows vale A thwarting joy on troubles breast. AUTUMN Lo! Autumn's come—wheres now the woodlands green? The charming Landscape? and the flowrey plain? All all are fled and left this motly scene Of fading yellow tingh'd with russet stain Tho these seem desolatley wild and drear Yet these are spring to what we still shall find Yon trees must all in nakednes appear 'Reft of their folige by the blustry wind Just so 't'will fare with me in Autumns life Just so I'd wish—but may the trunk and all Die with the leaves—nor taste that wintry strife Where Sorrows urge,—but still impede the fall. [O who can paint the anguish of the heart] O who can paint the anguish of the heart Or who the souls Ideas can impart At that dread moment the self murderer stands To fall ? In that dread moment when the frantic heart From Life the world &amp; all prepares to start To somewhere still unknown without a name Or heavens bliss or hells eternall shame The Victims anguish here the heart conceals &amp; none can tell but [only] them that [feels] When at the ponds steep verge she trembling stood &amp; gazd in horror on the whelming flood That gent[l]y crimpld on its breezy wave Soon to be ruffld with her watry grave In musing anguish for awhile she stands Holding her bosom with her clasping hands Then Looks around in pains too deep to tell &amp; bids to all around a last farewell &amp; o that anguish more then death severe That villians wrongs in dying doubly dear In silent prayer her eyes are fixt on heaven Her prayers are his that he may be forgiven Herself forgot her prayers are all for him &amp; fear &amp; fondness shivers every limb Then firm resolvd to end her every woe She takes a headlong plunge &amp; dives below The water splashes in convulsive sound &amp; foaming Eddies curdle all around To the pond side the dashing billows gush &amp; starts the blackbird from the hanging bush The wreathing chasm ebbs a weaker wave Forever closes on her watry grave &amp; starting bubles in disorder rise Where struggling fate beneath in horror dies Then puft by breezes out then rise again More small &amp; small the leesening drops remain Diminishing at last they all retire &amp; in a little train of froth expire Ring within ring as faint they reach the side Widening &amp; weakening gradually subside The dashing sound &amp; Eddying wreaths are oer &amp; gentle calms ensue as heretofore The breezes sweet crimps the curdling plain The blackbird seeks her nest &amp; sings again The sun smiles happy on the neighbouring scene &amp; all seems now as tho there nought had been The pond as usual meets each Gazers Eye Gazers as usual peeps &amp; hurrys bye &amp; as they mark the breezes curling wreath They little think of her that lyes beneath &amp; little thinks as swells each harmless wave That it is rolling over marys grave LOVE EPISTLES BETWEEN RICHARD AND KATE Epistle 1st from Richard Dear kate Since I no longer can Go on in such a mopeing plan I send these lines with ham and hum To let the[e] ‘no’ I mean to cum' Sum' time or uther you to see W'en things ar' fitting to agree For ever since you jog'd from here The day to me do's seem a year I can't endur't so 'tis no use I love you wel' without excuse Therefore as now I plainly show't I only wish for you to 'now't And w'en the let'er you do get Let it suffice you how I fret For e'rey night I gang to bed Nou'ht but kit runs in my he'd The boys they all keep clit'er clat'er Wondering w'at can be the mat'er W'y I look dul'.—and w'ats befel' They on'y wish I wou'd but tel' But I'm determind not to do't They'l' on'y call me foolish fo' 't Yet not as I shou'd car' for that 'T'wou'd on'y then be tit for tat But if I bro'ght thy name I 'no' Up 'mong such chaps as Jim and Jo (Tho Jim if he 'ad on'y sense) (To tel' mi'te be of conseq'ence) For he can reed an' never spel' (An' 'rite a let'er mons'orous wel') Was thou to hear't as likly mi''te 'Twou'd presen'ly to'n luv' to spite An' wou'd so much a terify'd thee As you ne'er after cou'd abide me This is the reeson kit (don't dou't it) That I ne'er tel' the boys about it For I'll sweet kit the thing is tru' Do ony thing to pleasur' you And w'ot you do'n't like sh'u'd be Shal' be the last thing dun by me For ere I 'rit this scrauling let'er (I wish I cou'd ha' 'rit a bet'er) Fe'ering sum peeping chaps mi''te 'no' I 'new not 'ardly w'ere to go Yet anx''us stil' to send you one I at last contriv'd an' pitch'd upon Our bushy clos' agen the link 'Twas ther' I went wi' pen an' ink The ink I stole from Jimys box For that he 'ardly ever lo'ks (And if I'm 'ang'd for doing so It wil' be you that caus'd the wo') The paper at the shop I got And lu'ky pitch'd upon this spot Wher' skilarks wis'l'd oer my head And morning shun so bri''te an' red The du on e'rey bush did hing An' bods of al' so'tes did so sing That cou'd I sing like farmer's Jo' (For shep'ads all can sing you 'no') I'd surely sung this very morn An' made a song in bushy laun But thats all now't I can'ot sing Nor 'bout this lawn nor 'bout the spring En'uf for me cans't thou but read This baddy stuf quite bad indeed An' w'at made worser on't you see Was writing on't upon my 'nee But w'y su'h 'pologin odrotit The stufs for you an' we'n you've got it Excuse the whol' an' never wonder That 'tis in all a worthles' blunder But kitty think nor think in vain My daily toyls my ni'tely pa'ne O if thy ''art can tender be 'Twil' never fa'le to pity me I must konclude ther'fore ad''u My ''art an' so'le's for' ever tru' Answer 1st from Kate Richard You sent your letter right It came 'an' pat' on friday night Brought by Farmers servant ‘Hobbs’ Who always does the Market jobs As luck wou'd have it he came by Our Lee close where the cows all lye He soon see me tho getting late And rode plump up before the gate His comeing thus supprisd me quite And set my very hair upright I'd lik'd to faint;

of loads he mov'd But ah the praises of the world abide Long as a buble on a floating tide Poor worn-out Dobbin good as he had provd In spite of all the loads he bore &amp; mov'd And spite of all his worthy labours past Fell like the rest a cumber ground at last Ah poor old injur'd Dobbin well might we Be warn'd to know the worlds deciet from thee Thou an Example both to horse &amp; man Shows how we're serv'd when we've done all we can But tho thy lot old Dobbin-boy was hard For such real merit to meet such reward Tho by thy master used so unkind The rural Muse is glad at heart to find 'Mong thy old friends thy memory still survive Where worthy deeds are sure to keep alive Those old companions of thy former time That knew thee well &amp; knew thee in thy prime When thou outmatch'd by none to none would yield That often geard thee in their team to field Those old Companions of thy former prime That yok'd thee out to field full many a time And many a day and many a weary morn That have with thee the lengthning furrow drawn And through each timley season as they roll'd The summers heat &amp; winters cutting cold Have stood with the[e]; with the[e] as partners shar'd The toiling slaves to those that better far'd These where thy friends &amp; these thy friends well knew A horses worth that might be trusted too And this they every day could prove &amp; see The value dobbin of a horse like thee They by expirience taught knew how to prize That worth which unexpirienc'd fools despise And treat thy Memory with that due respect Which thy self loving master does neglect Never through him by hardy work's attain'd And lasts no longer then his ends are gain'd Sway'd by self interest—when thy best was o'er As he could profit by thy strength no more When courage left thee &amp; old age came on And all the hopes of an amendment gone When willing still weak efforts provd too true That thou hadst done the utmost thou cou'dst do Then merits past and praises all adieu His profits vanishd and his praises too On merits past he could'n't tent to call Nor spare a praise where merits past was all But turnd the[e] out in yon bare grounds to feed To pine or die as future fate decreed And happy future fate did so ordain To see thy sufferance and to ease thy pain The Death of Dobbin rural Muse rehearse Recount his Merits in thy lowly verse Low as it is if thou thy Verse denies Poor dobbins merit with his carcass dies Poets would near (but shame to hint their aid In things so mean and where no gains are staid) For well well we now what dobbins left behind Will neer tempt fulsome flattery to be kind The task is thine for theres no gains in view So tune thy reed &amp; Dobbins song pursue Where grass at stand still all the year is found Winter &amp; summer scarce above the ground Where Rushes (usless in most places seen) Are all devoured (hungers bites so keen) Where spite of all the spears their leaves contain Sharp prickly thistles strive to rise in vain There with a motley drove of sheep &amp; cows (That on the green all summer daily brouze) His latter days poor dobbin ended there When helpless age requird the tenderest care There painful wanderd up &amp; down the plain And sought unceasing for a bite in vain Tho sheep &amp; cows &amp; other horses too Whent all the day as dobbin usd to do Tho they expeirencd ere the day was gone The painful pangs of hunger coming on Yet doubly blest &amp; happily they fard When this their lot to Dobbins was compard Tho daily pind the punishment was small All day they hungerd &amp; the day was all When twelve long hours or seeming long was past The welcome evening brought their wisht repast Joyful they saw the swains &amp; Maidens come And heard the signal to prepare for home There to regale oer upheapd cribs of hay Their sorrows closing with the closing day But Dobbin luckless horse of Misery No hopes had he of upheapd cribs to see Usless to him approachd each close of day There he was turn'd &amp; there he was to stay No pleasure he from closing day could find But the sad pleasure of being left behind To him alike the morn &amp; evening came Each found him pind &amp; left him still the same There left alone he pind the night away And blest had he been left alone by day For had these pilferers on his wretched fare Ceas'd their intruding daily visits there He might have joy'd to see the grass encrease And passd away his latter days in peace But luck like this for dobbin wor'n't reservd Twas his misfortune to be pind &amp; starvd There to remain &amp; patiently to bear His days &amp; nights in restless hunger there To search unceasing all in vain for food And dye by Inches till he died for good And doubly blest that hour &amp; doubly dear That showd poor dobin that his end was near. No happier moment in his life e'er past Then that sweet moment when he breathd his last No dearer night since he first drew his breath Then that dear night which clos'd his eyes in death Joys was the pains to those he felt before Pains (happy prospect) he would feel no more His pains &amp; hunger all for ever flew When the last groan bid weary life adieu. Ah poor old dobin badly was't thou serv'd To what thy merits &amp; thy worth deserv'd And could thy fellow kind have sence to see Well might they prove the worlds deciet from thee From thy Example plainly might be guest How they'll be thought of when they've done their best For still theres many a Dobbin left b[e]hind That to their sorrow will thy treatment find That spite of all their worthy merits past Will fall like thee meer Cumber ground's at last. No merits nothing—or in Lifes decline This usage dobbin would have neer been thine For better horse could not be harnesd out Then Dobbin was when he was young &amp; stout For well we know and ploughmen all agree That none for working could be match with thee For well twas known by ploughman in his prime Who to their joy hath provd it many a time When he was young by nature formed stout A Better horse could not be harnesd out His heart was willing &amp; too good to yield Alike the same at home or in the field True to his trust (a faithful servant provd) If aught set fast could possible be movd If down a craggy road or mirey fore A load had helted f[e]lley deep or more (For Drivers all for Dobbins help applied) In courage noble and as nobly tried No sooner yokd and the fond drivers pride Had clapt his praises on the heroes side Then he with all his might his strength decreed Fell too as willing as he went to feed Pull after pull he'd take without a word Wind &amp; repeat it of his own accord Repeated trials urg'd in vain to flinch What ere he gaind he never lost an inch And soon (if equal to his strength it provd) The joyful driver saw his doubts removd (Ah! then old Dobin well might be envy raise Your fellow horses to deserve the praise Which the pleas'd rustic in his raptures paid For thy past efforts so deserving made) And if repeated pulls did plainly prove The deep sunk load beyond his power to move Tho worn fatigued his heart undaunted still Always obedient to his drivers will And if still left beyond his power to try Upon his knees the worthy beast would lye And there his fruitles efforts still mentain There lye &amp; pull &amp; rise &amp; fall again And had his drivers faild to interfere And let him still keep pulling as he were So true the courage he so often showd He'd broke his heart &amp; fell beneath his load. Nor was his worth alone confined here In drawing well or heavy Lifts to clear At other labour he was still the same The best in being &amp; the first in fame At lighter jobs that gentler ways require He still performd them to his guides desire For tho so turbulent when strength's requird A gentler creature could not be desird Mild as a lamb a very child might guide And walk undanger'd by his gentle side E'en from each Maiden Dob did praise recieve That to his Masters yearly came to live Could they (a favour from rough will or john) But once get Dobbin to ride Market on His fames foundation then was surely laid To be aughmented all the time they staid For tho he was (as carters mostly prove) But slow of foot (tho never hard to move) Tho he requird of time a greater share And on his journey neer had much to spare His worth &amp; safety did his fame secure His ways all gentle &amp; his slowness sure —At Ploughing too he still reservd his fame His willing heart &amp; Courage still the same He'd draw a furrow straight without a bend Clear out the plough &amp; turn it round the end Without a Leader &amp; without a guide Ploughmen in Dob with Leader was suplied Use made him perfect &amp; his heart was good He took all gamly be what jobs they wou'd Threatnings were useles either fresh or tir'd Good words where all the notice he requir'd No wipcord lashes never markd a Limb Whipcord &amp; whips were usless all to him In short (his worth being well &amp; often provd) At every job his prescence was belovd The ploughmans only wish &amp; only pride Was but to be with Dobbins aid supplyd To have him in their team—for well they knew That Dobbins merits could be trusted too But ah resemblance of a flattering Dream What Boots it Dobbin to have your esteem —Vain world we know thee—well thy ways can tell Worth may gain praise when intrest bears the bell But when thats gone then praises all adieu Our worth is vanishd &amp; our praises too The Cobweb praises of the world abide Long as a Bubble on a floating tide Poor worn-out Dobbin good as thou had provd In spite of all the Loads thou bore &amp; movd In spite of all thy worthy Labours past To fall (sad fate) a Cumber ground at last A poor old injurd Dobbin well might we Be warnd to shun the worlds deciet from thee Thou an example both to horse &amp; man Shows how we're servd when weve done all we can THE WOUNDED SOLDIER O cruel War when will thy horrors cease And all thy slaughtering of poor men give oer O sheath O sheath thy bloody blade in peace Nor stain thy hand with human blood no more See at yon door were round the children swarm The piteous object of thy rage appears Thou'st left him nothing but a single arm Both legs are gone &amp; he is old in years O shatter'd man did ever eyes behold A more distressing form of misery Sure no good Christian heart will ere withold His worthy deeds of Charity from thee I'll sit me down and hear his woful tale And here he comes &amp; noising at his heels The Laughing boys too—O can Laughs prevail But they are young and know not what he feels Poor shatter'd fragment how he stumps the streets And how contentedly he seems to be He tells his woful tale to all he meets And now he'll tell his woful tale to me ‘O christian friend do pity &amp; relieve ‘A poor and pitious object in distress ‘Say not I mean your goodness to decieve ‘Look at these stumps they'll soon the truth confes’ Thus far proceeded—ah poor soul I cried The truth too true with grief at heart I see And tho thy wants can be but ill suplied Yet what I have I'll gladly share with thee He plac'd his crutch &amp;

SONG [Since Edward departed and lef me behind] Since Edward departed and lef me behind My heart is for ever in fear But if a short hope in his abscence I find Tis in Summer the prime of the year When the wind with the Zephers can scarce intervene A Curse on the billows to form When the Sky's Cloudless aspect so clear and serene Puts me out of doubt of a storm Then a Moments Composure I catch from the breeze And fancy my Edward as safe on the seas But O when in Autumn I shrink at the thought The Hurricanes terribly rise With such force as to meet with resistance from naught And toss the ships up to the skies &amp; o to experience the lightnings red flash Which darts thro' my window at night When instant the thunder rolls off with a Clash That stuns me to death with affright And when it is over my heart know's no ease From thinking what Edward endures on the seas O then thou almighty that rides on the wind And makes the dread thunder to roar To a poor timid maiden in pity be kind And Bid it to thunder no more Make the wind all his strength so oerbearing resign Or let him have no other power Then the Zephers so harmles:—with them let him join To dance in the Leaves of my Bower Then a daily composure I'll catch from the Breeze And for ever think Edward as safe on the sea's IMPROMTU Ah woodbine shade the very sight of thee Has spoilt my silence and tranquility When just before I had thy wild shade caught I wander'd happy blest without a thought But now alas thy image does restore False chloes woodbine round her cottage door That door which now to me access denies Yet still my heart its wishing fondness sighs ‘Did chloe know where collin is this hour ‘How he thinks of her by the woodbine flower’ —O! cease fond heart and let me call thee mine Leave that false bosom which will neer be thine How canst thou fancy without gains or aught False love will flatter for a simple thought? ELEGY Humbly attempted (from the overflowing effusions of a feeling heart) to pay a small tribute of esteem and gratitude to the memory of my dear friend companion and schoolfellow R[ichard] T[urnill] who was suddenly cut off in his youthful days by the fatal depredations of the Tipus Fever Ah cruel death to Friendship such a foe What fiend malicious could enforce thy power Thus in an instant to impede the blow Of budding hopes that rapt the finest flower. Did envy wrankling with her hollow eye Point to thy victim as above her clan Or did the angellic band from realms on high Deem him more fit an Angel then a man. But what's enquirey now? that must be vain Since his dear form (heartrending thought) is fled, Since he's demanded from his native plain To sleep unnotic'd with the silent dead. O tortering to[r]ments like a flood ye swell Oerbounding anguish and afflictive pain To think of him who so untimley fell Daily encreasing 'cause I mourn in vain. No couple sure throughout the world beside In friendship so familliar could be found, Friendship begun in childhoods earliest pride Endearing more as Reason gained ground. Ah childish scenes which manhood has declin'd, Ah trifling sports alike for ever fled How your remembrance often brings to mind My dear companion sleeping with the dead. The village close and green for play renown'd, The hedgerow bank where oft in searching ken We both have crawl'd along the mossy ground To hunt the snailhorn in his secret den. The thymy seated hill, the hoof plod ground Whose batterd surface ownd the marble ring, The straggling bush where many a nest was found, The shelterd hovel and the bathing spring. The uncooth name employment once for life Which still yon bridge within its arch retains, Mishapen rudley by his artless knife The only relic of his dear remains. (Oer whose unpolishd dints at eventide (Pure seeming scene of emblematic woe) The suns departing rays will faintly glide ‘And oer the whole a mournful lustre throw.’) These are the scenes which grieve me to behold; Anon the wheat-field where the blue-cap grew, With crimson corn-flowers and the yellow gould, All which our youth would eagerly pursue. These tell of other days with strength combind Of all our sports so innoscently rude, Which only serve to load my troubl'd mind With added griefs on others still renew'd. Then cease remembrance since it's all in vain To dwell on themes which nothing can restore These days are past my collin's left the plain And friends and kindred to return no more. And O his loss to kindred was severe ‘For in that heavn'ly youth for ever ends’ (What rarley does in riper age appear) ‘The best of sons, of brothers, and of friends.’ Adieu all goodnes centr'd in one piece Adieu dear friend—and thee to find again My hopes on that shall dwell and never cease Till death reveals my endless joys or pain. But the dear ties which love &amp; Nature binds And fond affection's heart adhereth too These cruel death undissapointed finds And these his hand is readiest to undo. Farewell companion of my early days &amp; while thy grave a brothers tears bedew I'll not forget my tributary praise To friendship sacred &amp; to memory due. SONG [When Chloe's gone then fancy lays] When Chloe's gone then fancy lays Her cunning schemes a thousand ways And what I might have done And (only charm for absent pain) When ere she comes this way again How Chloe may be won But when alas the maiden's nigh The languid look the half-sown sigh Is all that finds a way For plans and schemes are all destroy'd While fancy flies an hopeles void And leaves me naught to say COLLIN'S COMPLAINT When lovers to each other true In every virtuous wish agree How pleasing is the interview Alas! but how unknown to me For Chloe timid as the fawn Nor yet less timid then she's proud Call's ‘virtue’ to resist the lawn And ‘pr[i]de’ to shun me in a crowd Thus with her virtues blushing grace (Tho more disdainful pride I fear) She hates the private-public place And leaves me absent every where While Damon with his Fillis roves Freely possesing every charm Thro level meeds and shady groves They wander sweetly ‘arm in arm’ O! what can equal love like this When both with equal fondness burn Yielding—he gives a rapturous kiss Which she as freely does return But cease to praise—unconsious heart As Fillis is her Damons care He soon may take a jealous part And think that collin longs to share And if fair Chloe once should hear Soon soon excuse's would be crost Disdain now hid would then appear And hopes to gain entirley lost Then cease—and tho thy love seems naught But fancied hope in distant dreams And in a reality of thought Is nothing else but what it seems Yet hope and dwell on fond delay That time-to-come may better prove Make Chloe kind—and that I may In virtues bounds posess her love THE ROBIN Now the snow hides the ground little birds leave the wood And flie to the cottage to beg for their food While the domestic robin more tame then the rest (With its wings drooping down and rough feathers undrest) Comes close to our windows as much as to say ‘I would venture in if I could find a way ‘I'm starv'd and I want to get out of the cold ‘O! make me a passage and think me not bold‘ Ah poor little creature thy visits reveal Compla[i]nts such as these to the heart that can feel Nor shall such complainings be urged in vain I'll make thee a hole if I take out a pane Come in and a welcome reception thou'lt find I keep no grimalkins to murder inclin'd —But O! little robin be careful to shun That house where the peasant makes use of a gun For if thou but taste of the seed he has strew'd Thy life as a ransom must pay for thy food His aim is unerring his heart is as hard And thy race tho so harmles he'll never regard Distinction with him boy is nothing at all Both the wren and the robin with sparrows must fall For his soul (tho he outwardly looks like a man) Is in nature like wolves of the appenine clan Like them his whole study is bent on his prey Like them he devours what e'er comes in his way Then be careful and shun what is meant to betray And flie from these men-masked wolves far away Come come to my cottage and thou shalt be free To perch on my finger or sit on my knee Thou shalt eat of the crumbles of bread to thy fill And have leisure to clean both thy feathers and bill Then come little robin and never believe Such warm Invitations are meant to decieve In duty I'm bound to show mercy on thee While God dont deny it to sinners like me!

Dark was the night, in woeful plight Myrtilla mourn'd alone! No kind relief to ease her grief, Myrtilla's sorrow's own! The rude blasts roar the hugh trees oer, Myrtillas sorrow's own! While wispering nigh the foliage sigh, Myrtilla's early grave! The faries near all strive to chear Myrtilla's frighted mind, Each to her brought a hopeful thought, Myrtilla hears the wind. Loudly crying ‘fear not dying, ‘Myrtilla never fear, ‘Soon the morning will be dawning ‘Myrtilla's soul to chear!’ But soon the rain revers'd the strain, ‘Myrtilla—tilla lie!’ And cruel fate had fix'd his hate, ‘Myrtilla—tilla die!’ Far oer the plain the loving swain Myrtilla's voice did hear! And in the rain he call'd amain ‘Myrtilla—tilla dear.’ The swelling floods and hollow woods Myrtilla's name resound, The faries hear and wisper near Myrtilla will be found! But ah the lad so thinly clad Myrtilla must forgoe! Like fate the wind on him designd ‘Myrtilla—tilla O!’ When this was said, he droop'd his head:— Myrtilla on the wind In dying sounds no more resounds, Myrtilla's left behind. Ah wretched sight, if collins plight Myrtillas eyes could see, O hopeles view, 'twould thrice renew Myrtillas misery! ‘A tender form, unus'd to storms,’ Myrtillas breaking heart On this relied, and often crie'd Myrtilla's friends are tart.’ She softly sigh'd, and faintly cried, ‘Myrtilla thus distrest ‘Might but her woe for Collin's floe, ‘Myrtilla then could rest!’ ‘For if he's nigh he'll quickly flie, ‘Myrtilla's griefs to share O fate be kind! blow soft the wind! ‘Myrtilla's Collin spare!’ ‘'T'is all I crave, then welcome Grave!’ Myrtilla said no more, Death stopt her grief and blest releif, Myrtilla's griefs are oer! Ah friends severe that would'n't hear Myrtillas Innocense, Ah cruel love that would'n't prove Myrtilla's Recompence. Now both are dead and both are fled, Myrtilla and her dear, To other isles where morning smiles, ‘Myrtilla's soul to chear!’ Beyond the grave may Collin have Myrtilla for his due, While nightley here the fays revere Myrtilla's love so true!

How highly esteem'd is the sweet smelling rose Tis reckon'd the ‘finest of Flowers’ Unrival'd in flower-pots and posies it glows Nay the Queen of Parnassuse's Bowers And was I like Proteus so powerful indew'd With that uncommon magical power My form should this instant be chang'd and renew'd Yes turn'd to this beautiful flower Tho this strange Metamorphus by me so excited 'T'is not for my love of the flowers Nor is it the title with which I'm delighted To be ‘Queen of parnassion bowers’ No no thats a trifle not worth the possesing Far beneath the fond wish of a swain In the way that I crave it—'t'would—O a blessing! A blessing not call'd so in vain My wish for the change—is to win Chloe's bosom Those two swelling mountains of snow Where so nice in the Valley—each side to repose—on! I could see them both heave too and fro There posses'd of my Love a rose-life (or a day) I would kiss all its heaving alarms And when doom'd to wither I'd secretly stray To die in the midst of her charms This is why I wish for't:—my Chloe my dear Believe the fond truth that I show Tho you cannot expect the strange scene to appear Yet my Uncommon Love you may know! A WINTER WISH My wish now's to sit in a cottage made snug By a fire burning roozy and bright With a Friend to make shorter short days by a Jug And some Books for amusement at night And could I enjoy such a peaceable lot I'd ne'er cast on Fortune a frown Nor would I possesing my Friend, Books, and Cott Exchange 'em away for a—Crown! THE EAGLE AND THE CROW A Fable How aggravating 't'is to hear A Four-foot-nothing o'er his beer Crack and brag what he can do And what he has done years ago How when he was but boyish quite (And not much better now in hight) Could shoulder sacks of corn—alone Run like a Top with massy stone Top every gate he came but nigh And jump the locks where none durst try In climbing trees he'd yield to none Beat every one to walk or run Pelt o'er the steeple twice as high As any one he'd testify While chocking hole &amp; marble ring Always own'd him for their king To boxing too he could aspire And minded not the best Goliah At wrestling:—he'd such notions in it To wang their heels up in a minnute Howe'er in short this monstrous man Pretends to king of every clan So strong to bear so lythe to run So vers'd in jokes for sport and fun So skill'd so powerful in his youth So fond of every thing—but truth! For this the boaster does abhor Yet thinks hes nought to answer for When he's been cracking swearing lying He never fears the least of dying He goes to church as others do And thinks him self as righteous too —But his religion! what of that? 'T'is not the thing I pointed at His swaggering boasts and cracking stuff Is all I mean (and thats enough) Yes quite enough (in terms hydrolic) To kill his hearers with the cholic And what is worse this silly elf Will let none chatter but himself —To such concieted sons of pride I have a Fable near allie'd Which shows their easy over match'd And sometimes in a tether catch'd An Eagle once both stout and able (No matter where—tis but a fable) Struck at a little playful lamb While sporting near its frighted dam Pounc'd it and took it all together Easier than linnets do a feather A crow hard by from neighbouring wood Who near the scene of action stood Saw all:—But never blest her eyes No[r] deem'd it matter of supprise ‘Cant I’ she cries ‘as well [as] yon ‘Fine poltry Eagle just now gone ‘Strike at a lamb and bear't away? ‘Yes yes I can and will to day ‘Altho her tallons are more long ‘Mine are as sharp if not so strong ‘And tho my bodys not all out ‘So big so frightful and so stout ‘Yet that in pouncing has no part ‘I know I've got a bolder heart!’ So saying from the tree she springs And in a Lamb her tallons flings But ah poor crow she soon found out 'T'was harder than she talk'd about Soon she began to peck and pull To free her tallons from the wool But alls no use she's tangled still In vain the tallons wings or bill The more she tries to get unbound The more the nasty wool laps round Till quite worn out:—she waits to die And murmurs this reproving sigh ‘Had I ne'er like a boasting elf ‘With such vain exploits fuss'd my self ‘I ne'er had lit of this mishap ‘Nor ventur'd headlong in a trap ‘Oh could I but enjoy once more ‘That Liberty I had before ‘I'd never dream nor think I saw ‘A tallon on my silly claw!’ But 'mid this trouble so severe A shepherd who was listning near H[e]ard the sad cause of her mishap And took her from her wooly trap But not for Liberty? no never! This griev'd poor crowey worse than ever He clipt her wing and took her home To make some sport for little tom Who soon began with eager brawl ‘These dont destroy the lambs an' all? ‘No certainly howe'er put to't ‘I think such mortals could'n't do't!’ ‘Child’ cries the shepherd ‘you cant tell ‘How high concieted minds will swell ‘—'T'is no great while—if I can guess ‘About a couple hours or less ‘Since that concieted silly beagle ‘Fancy'd herself to be an eagle ‘But now I think the lambkins hide ‘Has dampt a little of her pride ‘And surley too she's learnt to know ‘Her name was nothing but a Crow!’ TO AN APRIL DAISY Welcome old Maytey peeping once again Our meeting minds me of a pleasent hour Springs pencil pinks thy cheek that blushy stain &amp;

all I ever knew where spent on thee &amp; who but loves to view where these where past &amp; who that views but loves em to the last Feels his heart warm to view his native place A fondness still those past delights to trace The vanish'd green to mourn the spot to see Where flourish'd many a bush &amp; many a tree Where once the brook (for now the brook is gone) Oer pebbles dimpling sweet went wimpering on Oft on whose oaken plank I've wondering stood (That led a pathway o'er its gentle flood) To see the beetles their wild mazes run With getty jackets glittering in the sun So apt &amp; ready at their reels they seem So true the dance is figur'd on the stream Such justness such correctness they impart They seem as ready as if taught by art In those past days (for then I lov'd the shade) How oft I've sighd at alterations made To see the woodmans cruel axe employ'd A tree beheaded or a bush destroy'd Nay e'en a post (old standards) or a stone Moss'd o'er by age &amp;

bleeting there the shepherds woolly charge Whose constant calls thy echoing vallies cheer'd Thy scenes adornd &amp; rural life endeard No calls of hunger pitys feelings wound Twas wanton plenty rais'd the joyful sound Thy grass in plenty gave the wish'd supply Ere sultry sun's had wak'd the troubling flye Then blest retiring by thy bounty fed They sought thy shades &amp; found an easy bed But now alas those scenes exist no more The pride of Life with thee (like mine) is oer Thy pleasing spots to which fond memory clings Sweet cooling shades &amp; soft refreshing springs &amp; tho fates pleas'd to lay their beauties bye In a dark corner of obscurity As fair &amp; sweet they blo[o]m'd thy plains among As blooms those Edens by the poets sung Now all laid waste by desolations hand Whose cursed weapons levels half the land Oh who could see my dear green willows fall What feeling heart but dropt a tear for all Accursed wealth oer bounding human laws Of every evil thou remains the cause Victims of want those wretches such as me Too truly lay their wretchedness to thee Thou art the bar that keeps from being fed &amp; thine our loss of labour &amp; of bread Thou art the cause that levels every tree &amp; woods bow down to clear a way for thee Sweet rest &amp; peace ye dear departed Charms Which once Industry cherish'd in her arms When peace &amp; plenty known but now to few Where known to all &amp; labour had his due When mirth &amp; toil companions thro' the day Made labour light &amp; pass'd the hours away When nature made the fields so dear to me Thin scattering many a bush &amp; many a tree Where the wood minstrels sweetly join'd among &amp; cheer'd my needy toilings with a song Ye perishd spots adieu ye ruind scenes Ye well known pastures oft frequented greens Tho now no more—fond memory's pleasing pains Within her breast your every scene retains Scarce did a bush spread its romantic bower To shield the lazy shepherd from the shower Scarce did a tree befriend the chattering pye By lifting up its head so proud &amp; high (Whose nest stuck on the topmost bough sublime Mocking the efforts of each boy to climb Oft as they've fill'd my vain desiring eye As oft in vain my skill essay'd to try) Nor bush nor tree within thy vallies grew When a mischevious boy but what I knew No not a secret spot did then remain Through out each spreading wood &amp; winding plain But in those days my presence once posest The snail horn searching or the mossy nest Oh happy Eden of those golden years Which memory cherishes &amp; use endears Thou dear beloved spot may it be thine To add a comfort to my life[s] decline When this vain world &amp; I have nearly done &amp; times drain'd glass has little left to run When all the hopes that charm'd me once are oer To warm my soul in extacys no more By dissapointments prov'd a foolish cheat Each ending bitter &amp; beginning sweet When weary age the grave a r[e]scue seeks &amp; prints its image on my wrinkl'd cheeks Those charms of youth that I again may see May it be mine to meet my end in thee &amp; as reward for all my troubles past Find one hope true to die at home at last So when the Traveller uncertain roams On lost roads leading every where but home Each vain desire that leaves his heart in pain Each fruitless hope to cherish it in vain Each hated track so slowly left behind Makes for the home which night denies to find &amp; every wish that leaves the aching breast Flies to the spot where all its wishes rest THE QUACK &amp; THE COBLER In country town,—as story goes, There liv'd a snob, In shop of stud &amp; mud Who got by cobbling up old shoes &amp;

Alltho my dim descriptive song Nought but a misty view can bring A misty view presented wrong Yet Memory cannot cease to sing For what I've heard and what I've seen In this;—and other scenes as well When leisure moments intervene My artles mind delights to tell Delights to tell the harmles ways Which occupy their every hour And show the picture that displays The cot, the tree, and garden flower More close than burs these pictures cling Impresive to their gazers view Raptures without a muse they bring —So right or wrong I will pursue O happy couple happy pair Your curious cottage fills mine eye With every thing convinient there From wind and rain both snug and dry Granduer (its stubble roof) excells Adorned with the house-leek flower Which holds (as superstion tells) A Charm to quell the lightnings power With its low windows diamond glass In vain may polish'd crown compare Nor can the Bowe's new mould surpass The homley old inventions there For when the sun emits a ray It brings a clock as well as light And both can tell the time of day Exactly by the shadows height The rooms more comfortable made Than courts or pallaces can be Tho all the ornament display'd Was furnish'd from necessity Save Ballads, songs, and Cutts, that hide Both window-shutters, wall, and door, Which tell of many-a-murder'd bride And desperate Battles daubed oer ‘Keep within compass’ courts the eye To read and learn a morral truth With ‘Golden Maxims’ paste'd nigh And ‘Pious counsils’ plan'd for youth There too on poltry paper wrought Disgrac'd with songs upon the screen (Of some poor penny hawker bought) King Charles's ‘Golden Rules’ are seen These with hundreds more beside In every hole and corner shine Displaying forth in cottage pride An Exebition simply fine Oh happy scenes what joys abound Not only which thy walls posess For every foot of Dobsons ground Claims the sweet name of Happiness! The hedge that bounds the pastur'd plains Was so beloved for its shade That all the shepherds and the swains Their hutts beneath its shelter made And hinds:—but what I would pursue Lengthens too much my simple ryhme —The broad-old-oak now meets my view Where dobson sits in summer-time O for a poets pen to show (When birds infest the rip'ning corn) How dobson hopples too and fro With brushing pole, or bell, or horn And simple ways and trifling things Which still his aged mind can please That every day successive springs As well from labour as from ease Lo! when he toils the bending grain Beats in his face her promis'd store And when he rests this little plain Reminds him of the crowded door In fancys eye the rustling sheaves Appear to treasuring ripness grown And his glad heart more rapturous heaves Because these treasures are his own! How e'er in short:—this happy pair So lonley in the valleys hid Enjoys more pleasure free from care Then e'er their Father Adam did! Spring's sprouting blade and swelling bud Summer's blown-flower and clefted-ground And Autumns yellow fading wood Brings joy in one continued round Winter wrapt in her dismal forms Cannot their happiness annoy Cold days, black nights, and snowy storms Inspire them with reflective joy Old dob when sitting by the fire Will often bid old judie ‘hark ‘I fear the wind is rising higher ‘And o the night is dismal dark’ ‘Ah think’ he cries, (while judie smoaks) ‘In this most dismal wintry night ‘How many poor tir'd travelling folks ‘Now meets the storm in woeful plight!’ ‘Perhaps now at this very hour ‘Some poor lost soul lays—down his head ‘Beneath a tree which turns no shower ‘And cannot find a better bed’ ‘For cloth'd with snow instead of dew ‘No longer they a shelter yield ‘More worse I know 'twill winnow thro ‘Then standing in the open field’ ‘O heavens now the wind gets higher ‘It grieves me;—yet I'm pleas'd to think ‘How we are blest with house and fire ‘A good warm bed, and meat, and drink,’ ‘And if the lost:—(I hope as well) ‘Should ever find their homes again That true old-saying then will tell ‘How sweet the pleasure after pain!’ ‘Then will they sit like you and I ‘And tell how Darkness led astray.— ‘O God with thy all-seeing eye ‘Guide the lone wanderer on his way’ Thus Dobson often does reflect When winters horrid tempests blow For he not blinded by neglect Can quickly feel anothers woe Nor does his fond reflections dwell On human self-like souls alone To the dumb Animals as well His feeling tendernes is shown He knows how cold the winters night Would be if he himself where there He feels for dogs—and takes delight In letting them his cottage share There soon as darkness speads the eve Tray takes his lodging near the door While purring puss with granted leave Prefers a Cushion to the floor Sometimes judie knits and sews While o'er the sutty hearth so snug He's often busied with the news Accompyni'd with bonny jug O happy couple happy pair Your little cottage fills mine eye With longing wishes to be there From wind and rain so snugly dry But other scenes suround thy spot Scenes in childhood vallued dear Nor shall they ever be forgot While life remains—or hope can cheer Yon garden fancy still retains Seated so warmly in the nook Of noted green-ends flowry plains Where closley flows the bubling brook There shepherd-lads and milking-maids Oft gather'd on its rushy brink Or in the willows cooler shades To rendevouze with sugar-drink But custom did these sports dispel Long ere old dob or judie where Yet still posterity can tell And still the tale they love to hear While some tho lov'd by shepherds long Dropt on a sudden like the wind Or lik'er still (as will) my song They dropt to leave no wreck behind The awthorn hedge that fences round Dob clips with all a gard'ners skill And shows his master-ship profound Instead of shears to use a bill There 'tat'es and leeks and cabbage grow With greens and lettuce's profuse There too the sweet carnations glow As well for pleasure as for use And there with rural sweetness made ‘In natures simplest habit clad’ The elder bower displays its shade Low bending o'er the grassy pad Thrice lovly shades;—this elder bower Old tasteful judie loves to see And loves to view each new-blown flower The bursting bud; or blossom'd tree —Now I must leave your shades so dear Tho dearer still as yet remain O! would some Bloomfield wander near To give such scenes an equal strain Adieu then lovly spot adieu Thou fountain of Felicity Fancy shall never loose her view Nor Silence cease to muse on thee SONG [Young Jemmy the pride of the Hamlett and mill] Young Jemmy the pride of the Hamlett and mill The pride of the [border] the vally and Hill Once the pride of the lasses—well—so he is still Altho hes undone the poor maid of the mill Still he lives in the vally With maidens to dally Altho hes undone the poor maid of the mill When the Hamlett and mill are all sleeping quite still And night slowly creeping hides vally and Hill He oft kisses the maiden in secret by the mill To see the coy maiden that liv'd at the mill Who few in the vally Tho dozens woulds dally So coy was the maiden that liv'd at the mill But one night (and he deems its Sunday night still) Then he used the maid for what we all do well on the Hill ‘Come, come’ ‘But—’ ‘O’ never mind that if you will’ ‘I'll for ever love sally—the maid of the mill He still cooing and billing At last she was willing ‘Oh my lovley sweet sally, the maid of the mill Think then of the ‘slanders and dally here still’ ‘Or Judgment you'll [soon] find is shame for the Maid of the Hill ‘Come, come’ ‘Yes’ ‘But’ ‘O' never mind that if you will ‘Ill for ever love sally the maid of the mill Now his heart was all wooing O he long'd to be doing ‘O how I love sally the maid of the Hill ‘Now now never mind [dearie] O' my charmer sit still ‘Well well to be sure on these meadow rill ‘Coud Jem now be so fond [of doing] your will?

THE PRIMROSE Welcome pale primrose starting up between Dead matted leaves of ash and oak that strew The every lawn the wood and spinney through Mid creeping moss and Ivys darker green How much thy presence beautifies the ground How bright thy modest unaffected pride Glows on the sunny bank and woodland side And where thy fairy flowers in groups are found The school-boy roams enchantedly along Plucking the fairest with a rude delight And the meek shepherd stops his simple song To gaze a moment on the pleasing sight Oerjoy'd to see the flowers that truley bring The welcome News of soft returning spring SONG [When mountain billows roar amain] When mountain billows roar amain And death looks in each sailors eye Vex'd Jemmy in oerpowring strain ‘Cries Susan tis for thee I die’ Mid swelling sighs Still jumps and cries ‘Proud susan tis for thee I die’ When lightning lacerates the cloud And waves increasing foams more high His rage more urgent calls aloud ‘Curs'd Susan tis for thee I die’ Hem'd in with waves Still jumps and raves ‘Curs'd Susan tis for thee I die’ But when the billows cease to rise And when their former calmness give Fond Jemmy soon recanting cries ‘Sweet Susan tis for thee I live’ In jovial flings Still drinks and sings ‘Sweet Susan tis for thee I live’ CRAZY JANE A Fragment Hark what shrill mournful strains Sounds from yon lonely plains Where the low-bending willow Drips thro the mimic billow Rais'd by the adverse winds that curl the stream How mournfully and plain Their dying langour on the breezes seem Say from what throat Or is this note? The song of Crazy Jane!— Ye swains from whence and where? Comes this sad grief so drear? It must be,—(O' so grieveing) Some loss thats past reprieving Or hope forlorn that never will return —They'r dumb;—Enquirey's vain Then lead me on ye sounds and let's descern And further know If all this woe Come's from poor Crazy Jane.

neighbouring brook A lowley cottage stands Meek salley child of innosence As dew wash'd lilley fair Her widow'd mothers only hope Once dwelt contented there No tenderer Mother to a child Throughout the world could be And in return no daughter prov'd More dutiful than she For when by palsey and by age She was quite helpless brought To do for her the best she could E[m]ploy'd her every thought Alike of sorrow and of joy She claim'd an equal share In short the aged helples dame Was salleys onley care But beauteys strong resistles power Which oft so fatal proves Doom'd her to feel the hopeles pain Of an unequal love Young william he a youth genteel As hunting in the wood One day pass'd by the lonley spot Where salleys cottage stood O had he turnd another way Thrice fortunatley he But fate and fortune did ordain It otherwise to be Tho little thinking such a maid Liv'd in so mean a shed At first to view the muddy walls He scarcely turn'd his head But when the maid approach'd his sight O agravating pain He sigh'd—he felt—he knew not how— And look'd and look'd again Frantic with love he stopt his horse And gaz'd with fond desire Which act so seeming rudely done Set salleys face on fire The soft rose left its station for The headache's crimson flower Which sooner then abate his love Arm'd it with double power For where real virtues jealous eye At trifles takes alarm Such innocense triumphs repleat With every winning charm Meeknes the female softnes suits And when they both combine Beyond the reach of beautys boast Far sweeter graces shine The fairest flowers that deck the wild The most endeangerd stand Sure to be seen and fall a prize To some destroying hand And well the hand that plucks their sweets This truth may prove and show That plainess triumphs still secure While

LIFE is—what? It is the shooting of a star, That gleams along the trackless air, And vanishes, almost ere seen, to nought. And such is Man— He shines and flutters for a span, And is forgot. Life is—what? It is the vermeil of the rose, That blooms but till the bleak wind blows, Then, all entomb'd in sweets, doth fade and rot. And such is Man— He struts in brav'ry for a span, And is forgot. Life is—what? It is a dew-drop of the morn, That quiv'ring hangs upon the thorn, Till quaff'd by sunbeams, 'tis no longer aught. And such is Man— He's steep'd in sorrow for a span, And melts—forgot. Life is—what? A stone, whose fall doth circles make On the smooth surface of the lake, Which spread till one and all forsake the spot. And such is Man— 'Midst friends he revels for a span, And sinks—forgot. Life is—what? It is a bubble on the main, Rais'd by a little globe of rain, Whose heir destroys the fabric it hath wrought. And such is Man— Swell'd into being for a span, And broke—forgot. Life is—what? A shadow on the mountain's side, Of rack, that doth on aether ride, Driv'n by the Northern gale, with tempests fraught. And such is Man— He hangs on greatness for a span, And is forgot. Life is—what? It is the sound of cannon near, Which strikes upon the startled ear, And ceases ere we can distinguish aught. And such is Man— He frights and blusters for a span, And is forgot. Life is—what? It is the swallow's sojournment, Who, ere green Summer's robe is rent, Flies to some distant bourne, by instinct taught. And such is Man— He rents his dwelling for a span, And flits—forgot. And is this—Life? Oh yes! and had I time to tell, A hundred shapes more transient still— But, whilst I speak, Fate whets its slaughterous knife, And such is Man— While reck'ning o'er Life's little span, Death ends the strife. A REFLECTION IN AUTUMN Now Autumn's come—adieu the pleasing greens The charming Lanscape &amp; the flowrey plain All are deserted from these motley scenes With blighted yellow ting'd &amp; russet stain Tho desolation seems to triumph here Yet these are spring to what we still shall find The trees must all in nakedness appear 'Reft of their foliage by the blustry wind Just so 'twill fare with me in Autumns life Just so I'd wish—but may the trunk &amp; all Die with the leaves—nor taste that wintry strife Where Sorrows urge—&amp; fear Impedes the fall!

And the snows o' the Winter, improv'd on her bosom, No need as a rival be told. And oh! my sad pains when I 'gan to disclose them I found it as chilling and cold.

[As I was walking out one Day] As I was walking out one Day, Which happened on the first of May; As luck would have it, I did spy, A May Pole raised up on high; The which at first me much surpriz'd, Not being before hand advertiz'd; Of such a strange uncommon sight, I said I would not stir that Night; Nor rest content, until I'd found, Its height exact from off the Ground; But when these Words, I just had spoke, A blast of Wind the May-Pole broke; Whose broken Piece I found to be, Exact in length, yards sixty three, Which by its fall broke up a hole, Twice fifteen Yards from off the Pole; But this being all that I can do, The May-Pole now being broken in two Unequal Parts, to aid a Friend, Ye Youths pray then an answer send.

The heart without feeling, the beauty's but small, Though tempting it be to the view; The warmth of a soul crowns the beauty of all, Without it thou'rt nothing—adieu! Thou Image of Beauty, endeavour is vain, To warm thee to life and to love, Could I but the skill of the artist attain, And steal thee a soul from above; Though as fair as the statue he finish'd art thou, 'Twere folly his plan to pursue; I would give thee feeling, but cannot tell how; I would love thee, dear—but, adieu! To all that life sweetens eternally lost, Where love makes a heaven below, Thy bosom's congealed in apathy's frost, As white and as cold as the snow: Since no spark of soul its dead tenant can warm, Thou Icicle hung on Spring's brow, I'll turn my sighs from thee to mix with the storm; The storm's full as tender as thou. That heart where no feelings or raptures can dwell, Be its owner in person most fair, Were beauty a bargain to buy or to sell, I never would purchase it there: So cold to the joys that in sympathy burn, Joys none but true love ever knew, How lost should I be could I prove no return: I wish to be happy—adieu! ON YOUTH Ah, youth's sweet joys! why are ye gone astray? Fain would I follow could I find a plan: To my great loss are ye exchang'd away, For that sad sorrow-ripening name—a man. Far distant joys! the prospect gives me pain: Ah, happiness! and hast thou no return? No kind concern to call thee back again, And bid this aching bosom cease to mourn? The daisies' hopes have met another Spring, Poor standard tenants on a stormy plain; The lark confirms it on his russet wing; And why alone am I denied? in vain: Ah, youth is fled! A second blossom I but vainly crave: The flower, that opes with peace to come, Is budding in the grave. THE FIRST OF MAY A BALLAD Fair blooms the rose upon the green, Pretending to excel; But who another rose has seen, A different tale can tell. The morning smiles, the lark's begun To welcome in the May: Be cloudless, skies! look out, bright sun! And haste my love away. Though graceful round the maidens move, That join the rural ball, Soon shall they own my absent love The rival of them all. Go, wake your shepherdess, ye lambs! And murmur her delay: Chide her neglect, ye hoarser dams! And call my love away. Ye happy swains, with each a bride, Were but the angel there, While slighted maids despair'd and sigh'd, You'd court th'unequall'd fair. Dry up, ye dews! nor threat'ning hing, To soil her best array: Ye birds! with double vigour sing, And urge my love away. Welcome, sun! the dews are fled, The lark has rais'd his song; The daisy nauntles up its head,— Why waits my love so long? As flowrets fade, the pleasures bloom, All hastening to decay: The day steals on, and showers may come: This instant haste away. What now, ye fearful cringing sheep! Who meets your wondering eyes? What makes you 'neath the maples creep, In homaging surprise? No ladies tread our humble green: Ah! welcome wonders, hail! I witness your mistaken queen Is Patty of the Vale. APPROACH OF SPRING Sweet are the omens of approaching Spring, When gay the elder sprouts her winged leaves; When tootling robins carol-welcomes sing, And sparrows chelp glad tidings from the eaves. What lovely prospects wait each wakening hour, When each new day some novelty displays; How sweet the sun-beam melts the crocus flower, Whose borrow'd pride shines dizen'd in his rays: Sweet, new-laid hedges flush their tender greens; Sweet peep the arum-leaves their shelter screens; Ah! sweet are all which I'm denied to share: Want's painful hindrance sticks me to her stall;— But still Hope's smiles unpoint the thorns of Care, Since Heaven's eternal Spring is free for all. SUMMER The oak's slow-opening leaf, of deepening hue, Bespeaks the power of Summer once again; While many a flower unfolds its charms to view, To glad the entrance of his sultry reign. Where peep the gaping, speckled cuckoo-flowers, Sweet is each rural scene she brings to pass; Prizes to rambling school-boys' vacant hours, Tracking wild searches through the meadow grass: The meadow-sweet taunts high its showy wreath, And sweet the quaking grasses hide beneath. Ah, 'barr'd from all that sweetens life below, Another Summer still my eyes can see Freed from this scorn and pilgrimage of woe, To share the Seasons of Eternity.

O sad deed while boys thy shades among With hardnd hearts her unfledg'd young purloin The cows stand loitering by thy flaggy brink Free from noons sultry flies &amp; in delight The weary cart horse hastens in to drink Then knaps the moist grass with a keener bite The singing milk maid journeying from the town Skips oer the stones that stride the meadow slough &amp;

O'er pathless plains, at early hours, The sleepy rustic sloomy goes; The dews, brush'd off from grass and flowers, Bemoistening sop his harden'd shoes; For every leaf that forms a shade, And every flowret's silken top, And every shivering bent and blade, Stoops, bowing with a diamond drop. But soon shall fly those pearly drops, The red, round sun advances higher; And stretching o'er the mountain tops, Is gilding sweet the village spire. Again the bustling maiden seeks Her cleanly pail, and eager now, Rivals the morn with rosy cheeks, And hastens off to milk her cow; While echo tells of Colin near, Blithe, whistling o'er the misty hills: The powerful magic fills her ear, And through her beating bosom thrills. 'Tis sweet to meet the morning breeze, Or list the giggling of the brook; Or stretch'd beneath the shade of trees Peruse and pause on nature's book; When nature every sweet prepares To entertain our wish'd delay,— The images which morning wears, The wakening charms of early day! Now let me tread the meadow paths, While glittering dew the ground illumes, As, sprinkled o'er the withering swaths, Their moisture shrinks in sweet perfumes; And hear the beetle sound his horn; And hear the skylark whistling nigh, Sprung from his bed of tufted corn, A hailing minstrel in the sky. First sunbeam, calling night away, To see how sweet thy summons seems, Split by the willow's wavy grey, And sweetly dancing on the streams: How fine the spider's web is spun, Unnoticed to vulgar eyes; Its silk thread glittering in the sun, Art's bungling vanity defies. Roaming where the dewey field Neath its morning burthen leans While its crops my searches shield Sweet I scent the blossomd beans Making oft remarking stops Watching tiny nameless things Climb the grasses spiry tops As they try their silken wings So emerging into light, From the ignorant and vain, Fearful Genius takes her flight, Skimming o'er the lowly plain, While in gay green glossy coat On the shivering benty baulk The grass hopper chirps his note Bounding on from stalk to stalk While the bee at early hours Sips the bowing beans perfumes Butter flys infest the flowers Just to show their Glossy plumes As oft industry seeks the sweet[s] Which weary labour ought to gain As oft the bliss the idle meets &amp; heaven bestows the bliss in vain Pleasd I list the rural themes Heartning up the ploughmans toil Urging on the gingling teams As they turn the mellow soil Industrys care abounds again As now the peace of night is gone Many a murmur wakes the plain Many a waggon rumbles on The swallow wheels his circling flight &amp; oer the waters surface skims Then on the cottage chimney lights &amp; twittering chaunts his morning hymns Stationd high a towering height On the sun gilt weather cock Now the jack daw takes his flight Frighted by the striking clock Snug the wary watching thrush Sits to prune her speckled breast Where the wood bine round the bush Weaving hides her mortard nest Till the cows with hungry low Pick the rank grass from her bower Startld then—dead leaves below Quick recieve the pattering shower Now the sythe the morn salutes In the meadow tinkling soon While on mellow tutling flutes Sweetly breathes the shepherds tune Where the bank the stream oerlooks &amp; the wreathing worms are found Anglers sit to bait their hooks On the hill with wild tyhme crownd While the treach'rous watching stork Nigh the heedless gudgeon flies Bobbing sinks the vanishd cork &amp; the roach becomes a prize Neath the black thorns stunted bush Cropt by wanton oxen down Wistling oer each culling rush Cowboys plats a rural crown As slow the hazy mist retires Crampt circle more distinctly seen Thin scatterd huts &amp; neighbouring spires Drops in to stretch the bounded scene Brisk winds the Lightnd Branches shake By pattering plashing drops confest &amp; where oaks dripping shade the lake Prints crimpling dimples on its breast The misted brook its edges reek Sultry noon is drawing on The east has lost its ruddy streak &amp; proves that mornings sweets are gone In torturd haste retreating cows Plunge head long in the spangld flood Or sweeping by the oaken boughs Brusing trace the tangld wood In all directions buzzing by Wakend by the sultry heat Once again the tiresome flye Bold intruding plagues repeat Now as morning takes her leave &amp; while swelterd nature mourns Let me waiting soothing eve Seek my cot till she returns THE DYING SNOWDROP Snow drop I mourn thee oer thy early tomb Thy witherd fragrance so autumly shed Killd by the pride that gave thy spotless bloom Upon the Snow low droops thy witherd head So artless beauty oftentimes undone Unconsious sleeping on Seductions breast Like the poor Lark the fowlers wiles have won Falls on the spot when profferd of his rest TO THE VIOLET Hail to the[e] violet sweet carless spread Neath each warm bush &amp; covert budding hedge In many a pleasing walk have I been led To seek thee—promise of springs earliest pledge In modest coyness hanging down its head Unconsious hiding beautys from the eye &amp; sweetly brooding oer its gracful form Shunning each vulgar gaze that saunters by &amp; timly stooping from an april storm As virtue startled by approaching harm Shrinks from delusions false betraying hand[s] With bashful look that more the bosom warms So sweetest blossom the coy violet stands Tempting the plunderer with a double charm [There was three ravens sat upon a tree] There was three ravens sat upon a tree High down high derry down There was three ravens sat upon a tree Down O There was three raven[s] sat upon a tree As black as black as they could be (As deep in love as he &amp; she) High down derry O Said the middlemost raven to her mate Where shall we go our fill to take Down in yonder grass green fields (There we may go &amp; take our fill There runs a river clear [&amp;] chill) There lies a man on a grass green hill Where we may go &amp; take our fill With a greyhound standing at his feet Licking the wounds that was so deep</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Volume II The Village Minstrel and other poems HOME O Home however homley—thoughts of thee Can never fail to cheer the abscent breast How oft wild raptures have been felt by me When back returning weary and distrest. How oft I've stood to see the chimney pour Thick clouds of smoak in collumn's lightly blue And close beneath the houseleeks yellow flower As fast approaching in a nearer view. These tho they'r trifles ever gave delight E'en now they prompt me with a fond desire Painting the evening group before my sight Of friends and kindred seated round the fire. O Time how rapid did thy moments flow That chang'd these scenes of joy to scenes of Woe! POVERTY Rank Poverty dost thou my joys assail And with thy threatnings fright me from my rest I once had thoughts that with a Bloomfields tale And leisure hours I surely should be blest. But now I find the alterative scene From these few days I fondly thought my own Hoping to spend them private and alone But lo! thy troop of spectres intervene; Want shows his face with idleness between Next shames approaching step that hates the throng Comes sneaking on with sloth that fetters strong:— Are these the joys my leisure hours must glean? Then I decline:—But know rank powers where ere ye meet You ne'er shall drive me from the muses seat. NARRATIVE VERSES WRITTEN AFTER AN EXCURSION FROM HELPSTON TO BURGHLEY PARK The faint sun tipt the rising Ground No Blustry wind—the air was still The Blue mist thinly scatterd round Verg'd along the distant hill Delightful morn—from labour free I jocund met the southwest gale While here and there a busy bee Hum'd sweetly oer the flowery vale O! Joyful morn:—on pleasure bent Down thy green slopes and fields I flew And thro' the thickest covert went Which hid me from the public view Nor was it shame nor was it fear No no it was my own dear choise I love the Brierey thicket where Echo keeps her mocking voice The suns increasing heat was kind His warm beams chear'd the vales around I left my own fields far behind And pilgrim-like trod foreign ground The glowing landscapes charms I caught Where ere I look't or wander'd oer And every wood and field me thought A greener brighter prospect wore Delicious morn!—thou'lt always find When a hours pastime intervenes A vacant opening in my mind To think and cherish thy fond scenes Tho no hughe rock approach'd my sight Nor lofty mountain rear'd its head Enough for wonder and delight All around my path was spread Sometimes musing on the skie Then list'ning to the waterfall Now saw—the sun beams mounted high Glistering shine on walkerd hall Thus I often made a stand Thus I mark't each curious spot And seemingly to court my hand I now and then a cowslip got But Barnack Sinnoms thines the place Where antique forms are dimly shown There oer thy moss grown hills I trace Scenes which never will be known The deep sunk moat the stoney mound Brought oer my mind a pensive fit And ‘ah’ thought I while looking round ‘Their heads dont ache that made yon pit’ O! thou long rememberd morn How blest was I in these dear vales When snugly hid beneath the thorn I mus'd oer Bloomfields ‘rural tales’ And there sweet bard thy forest song Describ'd with energy sublime Fraught with such music charmd my tongue And turn'd my simple thoughts to ryhme Thus ever varying my mind Ever running like the rill Soon I left these scenes behind In quest of others brighter still Yet not for ever!—no ye vales I love your pleasant shades too well And often since to view your dales I've brush'd along the upland swell Now nothing save a running stream For awhile my eye engag'd Whose plaintive murmurs soothd my dream And all aspiring thoughts assuag'd Now as near its mossy bank I well remember how I lay Stretching oer the oaken plank To see the dancing beetles play Tho the stranger passing by Scarcley gave a single look Yet for a whole day I could lye And pore upon this little brook Well pleas'd to view its winding rounds And see the eddying purls it made But still its daisy skirted bounds Like ‘Barnam water wants a shade’ But O! that spot so long endear'd Gleaming rapterous on my sight Fill'd—ere the oak tree tops appeard My Breast with wonder and delight There art and nature friendly join'd Intermingling charm'd the eye And as their varying forms combin'd Each gave each a nobler dye O! fancy now I ask thy aid And Poet like to guide my flight Point out every charming shade Freshen all before my sight Enough thy power—the spacious park The towering chasenuts hughe and high The arching groves and walks so dark And all appear in mem'rys eye With deep regret I view'd the spire Which told the busy vil so nigh For lonley shades are my desire Far from the reach of human eye The foot pad turning to the town No longer provd alone to me Loud noisy murmurs filld the air And spoild my deep sollemnity The passing hours jog'd on apace And in their progress seem'd to say ‘Haste and gain that destind place ‘Or soon thoult loose the flitting day’ I instantly obey'd their call Nor went to where the foot-pad lay But clamberd oer an old rough wall And stole across the nearest way No spire I caught nor woody swell My Eye confind to lower bounds Yet not to mark the flowrets bell But watch the owners of the grounds Their presence was my only fear No boughs to shield me if they came And soon amid my rash career I deem'd such trespasing to blame For troubl'd thoughts began to rise Of ills almost beyond relief Which might from this one cause arise And leave me there to whant reprief So arguing with my self how vain An afterthought ‘Still to keep free’ Made me to seek the road again And own the force of Liberty For O! its unabated power Did then my breast with raptures fill And sure it was a happy hour That led me up to Barnack hill There uncontrould I knew no bounds But lookt oer Villages a crowd And cots and spires to farthest rounds While far trees seem'd a misty cloud While tir'd with such farstretching views I left the green hills sideling slope But O! so tempting was the muse She made me wish she made me hope I wish'd and hop'd that future days (For scenes prophetic fill'd my breast) Whould grant to me a Crown of bays By singing maids and shepherds drest These for awhile gave such delight And occupy'd my mind so strong That not one view could tempt my sight But all unheeded passd along Save only when that destin'd place As yet unknown tho long endear'd Enrich'd with many a namles grace Thro Fancys flitting eye appear'd At length I came where taper poles 'Reft of their grains from top to toe Stood uniform mid hills and holes Naked waving to and fro ‘Well ye mimic shades’ thought I ‘If this be grandeur give me still ‘The wild wood shade where I may lye ‘And see their branches spread at will’ But when aside the spacious park The massy grated gate I saw And arching groves and walks so dark They struck me with a sacred awe To see the rows of trees so green As far as eye can stretch to see And such long gravel walks so clean Was wonderful indeed to me TO THE VIOLET Sweet tiney flower of darkley hue Lone dweller in the pathles shade How much I love thy pensive blue Of Innoscence so well display'd. What time the watry skies are full Of streaming dappl'd clouds so pale And sideling rocks more white than wool Portending snowey sleet or hail. I 'gin to seek the[e] charming flower Along each hedghrows mossy seat Where dithering many a cold blee hour I've hug'd my self in thy retreat. What makes me cherish such fond taste What makes such raptures spring for thee Is that thou lov'st the dreary waste Which is so well belov'd by me. For sollitude should be my choise Could I this labouring life resighn To see the little birds rejoice And thy sweet flowers in clusters shine. I'de chuse a cave beside some rock Closd in all round with ash and thorn As near my door thy tribes might flock To shed their sweets in early morn. But ah! that way would never prove Means to sustain impending life I must forgo those scenes I love And still beat on with needy strife. Sweet flower we must reverse the plan Nor cherish such romantic views I'll strive to seek thee when I can Thro noontide heat or evening dews. So spring return with all thy train Of flowrets clothd in varied hue I long to see that morn again Which brings to light the vi'lets blue. HELPSTON GREEN Ye injur'd fields ye once where gay When natures hand displayd Long waving rows of willows grey And clumps of awthorn shade But now alas your awthorn bowers All desolate we see The woodmans axe their shade devours And cuts down every tree Not trees alone have ownd their force Whole woods beneath them bowd They turnd the winding riv'lets course And all thy pastures plough'd To shrub nor tree throughout thy fields They no compassion show The uplifted axe no mercy yields But strikes a fatal blow When ere I muse along the plain And mark where once they grew Rememb'rance wakes her busy train And brings past scenes to view The well known brook the favorite tree In fancys eye appear And next that pleasant green I see That green for ever dear Oer its green hills I've often stray'd In childhoods happy hour Oft sought the nest along the shade And gatherd many a flower And there with playmates often join'd In fresher sports to plan But now increasing years have coin'd These childern into man The greens gone too—ah lovely scene No more the kingcup gay Shall shine in yellow oer the green And shed its golden ray No more the herdsmans early call Shall bring the cows to feed Nor more the milkmaids evening brawl In ‘come-mull’ tones succeed Both milkmaids shouts and herdsmans call Have vanish'd with the green The kingcups yellow shades and all Shall never more be seen But the thick culterd tribes that grow Will so efface the scene That after times will hardly know It ever was a green Farwell thou favorite spot farwell Since every efforts vain All I can do is still to tell Of thy delightful plain But that pro[v]es short—increasing years That did my youth presage Will now as each new day appears Bring on declining age Reflection pierces deadly keen While I the moral scan As are the changes of the green So is the life of man Youth brings age with faultering tongue That does the exit crave There's one short scene presents the throng Another shows the grave THE TOMB Once musing oer an old effaced stone Longing to know who's dust it did consceal I anxious ponder'd oer what might reveal And sought the seeming date with weeds oergrown, But that prov'd fruitles—both the date and name Had been for ages in oblivion thrown. The dim remains of sculptur'd ornament Gave proof sufficient t'was reward for fame. This did my scearching view so much torment That time I qu[e]stion'd to expose the same But soon a check—‘and what is that to thee? ‘'Bout who lies here?—since thou whilt quickly be ‘Forgot like him:—Then time shall bid thee go ‘To Heavens pure bliss or hells tormenting woe’. DAMON AND COLLIN Damon When I meet Phillis in my morning walk She first salutes the morn and stays to talk The biggest secret she will not refuse But freely tells me all the village news And pleas'd am I can I but haply force Some new made tale to lengthen the discourse For—O so pleasing is her company That hours like minutes in her prescense fly I'm happy then nor can her abscence ere Raise in my heart the least distrust to fear Collin When Chloe meets me I find naught to say She hangs her head I turn another way Sometimes (but never till the maid's gone bye) ‘Good morning’ faulters weaken'd by a sigh Confounded I remain but yet delight To look back on her while she's out of sight Then thens the time that absence does torment I jeer my weakness and I do repent To think how well I might have then confest That secret love which makes me so distrest But when the maidens vanish'd for awhile Recruited hopes my future hours beguile I fuss my self ‘Another time I'll tell’ Which (if not better) will be quite as well Thus days and weeks and months I've dallied oer And now no nearer then I was before Damon Such ways as these I ever strove to shun Nor was I bashful when I first begun Freely I offerd posies to the maid Which she as freely with her smiles repaid Yet had I been like you affraid to own My love.—her kindness had been still unknown And now the maidens kindness to requite I strive to please her morning noon and night The garland and the wreath for her I bind Compos'd of all the fairest I can find For her I stop the straggler going astray And watch her sheep when she's not in the way I fetch them up at night and shift the pen And in the morning let them out agen For her in hearvest when the nuts are brown I take my crook to pull the branches down And up the trees that dismally hang oer The deep black pond (where none durst go before) I heedles climb as free from fear as now And snatch the clusters from the top-most bough Well pleas'd to risk such dangers that can prove How much her damon does his Phillis love Collin I search the meadows and as well as you I bind up posies and sweet garlands too And if I unawares can hear exprest What flower she fancies finer than the rest Grow where it will I search the fields about And search for't daily till I find it out And when I've found 'em,—O'—what tongue can tell The fear and doubts with which my breast does swell The schemes contriving and the plans I lay How I to her the garland must convey And various indeed.—sometimes I start Resolv'd to tell the secrets of my heart Vowing to make the gather'd garland prove How much I languish and how much I love But soon resolves and vows alay their heat And timid weakness reasumes her seat The garland then as I so painful sought Instantley seems as if twas good for naught ‘Ah gaudy thing’ I sigh ‘will Chloe wear ‘Such foolish lumber in her Auburn hair?’ Thus doubts and fears each other do confound And thus perplex'd I throw it on the ground Walk from't—distrest—in pensive silence mourn Then plan a scheme! and back again return Once more the garland in my hands I take And of the best a smaller posie make Resting assur'd that such a nosegay will To gain her favour prove a better still So off I go with posie in my coat Knowing the plains where chloe does resort And then my hopeful heart from grief's reviv'd By this new plan so seeming well contriv'd I gain the spot!—Ah! then, alas!—I go Sneaking along—my heart misgives me too Then as I nearer draw, ‘well now’ thinks I ‘I'll not speak to her, but pass silent bye’ While from my coat that precious gift I rend Which I for her before-hand did intend And after all my various scheeming so The flowers as worthless to the ground I throw And if by getting through the hedge bound plain Having no sense to find the same again Her little lambkins raise a petious cry Calling for help—if I'm far off or nigh It matters not can I but hear their moan (Of hers more tenderer than I am my own) The journeys nought at all no steps I grudge But with great pleasure to its aid I trudge Yet this is never to the maiden known Nor never done save onley when alone For fearing that by it the swains will prove (Or she herself) the favour to be love As I behind her back so loving where So when she's there as careles I appear Nor can I have the face (altho my mind At the same times most willingly inclind) To do for her the least as ever where Nor join the tale where she does interfere If from her looks a smile I do obtain I feel oer joy'd but never smile again And when I hear the swains her beauty praise And in such artful fond alluring ways To snatch the Posie from her swelling breast And loose the ribbon round her slender waist Then more familliar touch her courling hair And praise her beauty as b[e]yond compare At this sad pains around my heart will sting But I near look nor tell a single thing THE WOOD-CUTTERS NIGHT SONG Welcome red and roundy sun Dropping lowley in the west Now my hard days work is done I'm as happy as the best Joyful are the thoughts of home Now I'm ready for my chair So till 'Morrow-morning's come Bill and Mittins lye ye there Tho to leave your pretty song Little Birds it gives me pain But to morrow is not long Then I'm wi' you all again If I stop and stan' about Well I know how things will be Julie will be looking out Every now and then for me So fare-ye-well and hold your tongues Sing no more untill I come They're not worthy of your songs That never cares to drop a crumb All day long I love the Oaks But a' nights yon little cot Where I see the chimney smoaks Is by far the prettiest spot Wife and childern all are there To revive with pleasent looks Table ready set—and chair— Supper hanging on the hooks Soon as ever I get in When my faggot down I fling Little prattlers they begin Teazing me to talk and Sing ‘Welcome red and roundy sun ‘Dropping lowley in the west ‘Now my hard days work is done ‘I'm as happy as the best’ ‘Joyful are the thoughts of home ‘Now I'm ready for my chair ‘So till 'Morrow-morning's come ‘Bill and Mittins lye ye there’ TO THE BUTTERFLYE Lovley insect haste away Greet once more the sunny day, Leave, o leave the mirky barn Ere trapping spiders thee discern, If they do they will beset Thy golden wings in filmy net, Then alls in vain to set thee free Hopes all lost for Liberty Soon they'l drag thee in the wall Suck thy downy form and all; Murder tho a base employ Tis the spiders only joy Then lovley insect haste away Greet once more the sunny day. Never think that I belie, Never fear a winters skie, Budding oaks may now be seen, Starry daises deck the green Primrose groups the wood adorns Cloudless skies and blossom'd thorns These all prove that spring is here, Haste away then never fear. Skim oer hill and valley free Perch upon the blossom'd tree; Tho my garden would be best Couldst thou but contented rest, There the schoolboy has no power Thee to chase from flower to flower, Harbour none: for cruel sport Faraway they do resort, Nothing there but Liberty Pleasent place for thee and me, Then lovley insect haste away Greet once more the sunny day. Hither bend thy roving flight In my garden take delight, Tho the dew bent level dale Bears the lilly of the vale, Tho the thickets bushy dell Tempts thee to the foxglove's bell; Come but once within my bounds View the gardens airy rounds, Soon thou'lt find a sweeter air Tho there's not such numbers there, Soon thou'lt find the scene compleat And every flowret twice as sweet; Then lovley insect come away Greet once more the sunny day:— Oft I've seen when warm and dry 'Mong the beanfields bosom high, Thee lightly skim from pea to pea, (Solitude for the[e] and me) Then thy starry gems and gold Admiration would unfold; For what insect is't can vie With the lovley Butterflye Lo! the arching heav'nly bow Does all his dyes on thee bestow, Crimson, Blue, and watry Green Mix'd with Azure shade between These are thine:—thou first in place Queen of all the insect race And I've often thought alone This to thee was not unknown; For amid the sunny hour When I've found thee on a flower, (Searching ken with minute gleg) Oft Ive seen thy little leg, Soft as glass o'er velvet glides Smoothen down thy silken sides Then thy wings would ope' and shut, Then thou seemingly would strut.

mixt in timley toil—but een as now Ambitions prospects fird his little soul &amp; fancy soard &amp; sung bove povertys controul 5 Small joy to him was childhoods tempting tricks Which schoolboys look for in their vacant hours Wi other boys he little card to mix Joy left him lonly in his awthorn bowers As haply binding up his notts of flowers Or list'ning unseen birds to hear em sing Or gazing down ward where the runnel pours Thro the mossd brig in many a wirling ring How woud he muse oer all on pleasures fairy wing 6 The ‘I spye’ haloo &amp; the marble ring &amp; many a game that infancy employs The spinning top wird from the twitching string The boastfull jump of strong exulting boys Their sports their pastimes all their pleasing toys We leave unsung—tho much such rural play Woud suit the theme—yet theyre no lubins joys Truth breaths the song in lubins steps to stray Thro woods &amp; fields &amp; plains his solitary way 7 Nature lookd on him wi a witching eye Her pleasing scenes was his delightful book Where he while other louts gaumd heedless bye Wi wild enthusi[a]sm us'd to look The king cup vale the gravel paved brook Was paradise wi him to muse among &amp;

swains at plough &amp; pasture speckt wi sheep &amp; horse &amp; cow &amp; many a beauty that does intervene The steeple peeping oer the woods dark brow While many a young hope popt its smile between &amp; wishd mans days to spend in some such peaceful scene 9 Each opening season &amp; each opening scene On his wild view still teemd wi fresh delight Een winters storms to him have Welcome been That brought him comfort in its long dark night As joyful listning while the fire burnt bright Some neighbouring laboure[r]s superstitious tale How ‘Jenny burnt a-se’ wi her wisp alight To drown a nighted traveller once did fail By knowing well the brook that wimperd down the vale 10 &amp; haunted tales which village legends fill As true as gospel revealations told Of narrow lane &amp; wood &amp; lonly hill &amp; ruins where a castle stood of old How many a nighted man did there behold Ghosts wi out heads &amp;

had the hind a heart to thus pursue He might come in for ‘money wi out end’ Or bring to light some murder still unkend That justice might revenge &amp; peacful lay The wandering sprite whose hauntings then will end Thus lubin swallowd all they had to say While each long winters night pass'd unpercievd away 12 &amp; tales of fairy land he lovd to hear Those mites of human form like skimming bees That flye &amp; flirt about but every where The fly like tribes of nights un'scerning breeze That thro a lock hole even creep wi ease The freaks &amp;

gen their visits all things neat prepard As fays nought more then cleanliness regard When in the morn they never faild to share Or gold or silver as their meet reward Dropt in the water superstitions care To make the charm succeed had cautious placed there 14 &amp;

ghosts hind grave stones 'peard in sheets of white Dread monsters fancy moulded on his sight Soft woud he step lest they his tread shoud hear &amp; crept &amp; crept till past his wild afright Then on winds wings woud rally as it where So swift the wild retreat of childhoods fancyd fear 16 &amp; when fear left him on his corner seat Much woud he chatter oer each dreadful tale Tell how he heard the sound of 'proaching feet &amp; warriors gingling in their coats of mail &amp; lumping nocks as one woud lump a pail Of spirits cunjourd in the charnel floor &amp; many a mournful shriek &amp; hapless wail Where maids self murderd their false loves deplore —&amp; from that time woud vow to tramp a nights no more 17 O who can speak his joys when springs young morn From wood &amp; pasture opend on his view When tender green buds blush upon the thorn &amp; the first primrose dips its leaves in dew Each varied charm how joyd woud he pursue Oer yellow furze clad heath &amp; val[e] &amp; lawn Tempted to trace their beautys thro the day Grey girdl'd eve &amp; rosey wreathed morn Have both beheld him on his lonley way Far far remote from boys &amp; their unpleasing play 18 Sequesterd nature was his hearts delight Him woud she lead thro wood &amp; lonly plain Searching the pooty from the rushey dyke &amp; while the thrush sung her long silencd strain He thought it sweet &amp; mockt it oer again &amp; while he pluckt the primrose in its pride He ponderd oer its bloom tween joy &amp; pain &amp; a rude sonnet in its praise he tryd Where natures simple way the aid of art supplyd 19 The fresh'n'd lanscapes round his routs unfurld The fine tingd clouds above the woods below Each met his eye a new revealing world Delighting more as more he learnd to know Each journey sweeter musing too &amp; fro Surrounded thus a paradise as sweet Enthusiasm made his soul to glow His heart wi wild sensations usd to beat As nature seemly sung his mutterings usd repeat 20 Upon a molehill oft he dropt him down To take a prospect of the circling scene Marking how much the cottage roofs thatch brown Did add its beauty to the budding green Of sheltering trees it humbly pe[e]pt between The waggon rumbling oer the stoney ground The windmills sweeping sails at distance seen &amp; every scene that crowds the circling round Where the skye stooping seems to kiss the meeting ground 21 &amp; dear to him the rural sports of may When each cot threshold mounts its hailing bough &amp; ruddy milk maids weave their garlands gay Upon the green to crown the earliest cow When mirth &amp; pleasure wears its joyful brow &amp; joins the tumult wi unbounded glee The humble tenants of the pale &amp; plough He lovd ‘old sports’ by them revivd to see But never card to join in their rude revellry 22 Oer brook banks stretching on the pasture ground He gazd far distant from the jocund crew Twas but their feats that claimd a slight regard Twas his his pastimes lonly to pursue Wild blossoms creeping in the grass to view Scarce peeping up the tiney bent as high Betingd wi glossy yellow red or blue Unnamd unoticd but by lubins eye That like low genius sprang to bloom their day &amp; dye 23 O who can tell the sweets of maydays morn To waken rapture in a feeling mind When the gilt east unveils its dappld dawn &amp; the gay wood lark has its nest resignd As slow the sun creeps up the hill behind Morn reddning round &amp; day lights spotless hue As seemly sweet wi rose &amp; lily lind While all the prospect round beams fair to view As the sweet opening flower wi its unsullied dew 24 Ah often brushing thro the dripping grass Has he been seen to catch this early charm Listning the ‘love song’ of the healthy lass Passing wi milk pail on her well turnd arm Or meeting objects from the rousing farm The gingling plough teams droving down the steep Waggon &amp; cart—&amp; shepherd dogs alarm Raising the bleatings of unfolding sheep As oer the mountain top the red sun gin to peep 25 Nor coud the days decline escape his gaze He lovd the closing as the rising day &amp; oft woud stand to catch her setting rays Whose last beams stole not unpercievd away When hesitating like a stag at bay The bright unwearied sun seemd loath to drop Till chaos night hounds hurried him away &amp; drove him headlong from the mountain top &amp; shut the lovly scene &amp; bid all nature stop 26 With contemplations stores his mind to fill O doubly happy woud he roam as then As the blue eve crept deeper round the hill While the coy rabbit venturd from his den &amp; weary labour sought its rest agen Lone wanderings led him haply by the stream Where unpercievd he joyd his hours at will Musing the cricket twittering oer its dream Or watching oer the brook the moon lights da[n]cing beam 27 &amp; here the rural muse might aptly say As sober even sweetly siles along As how she chasd black ignorance away &amp; warmd his artless soul wi' feelings strong To teach his reed to warble forth a song As how it echod on the even gale All by the brook the pasture flowers among But ah such trifles are of no avail Theres few to notice him or hear his simple tale Lubins Song He sung of the seasons he sung of the day As soon as the morning is known To wipe the black curtains of night time away &amp; show the red fringe of her own O sweet was the scene neath its dew drop[p]ing dye O sweet was each object that courted the eye &amp; he sung how the cock labours slumbers unseald &amp; hastnd her tenants to toil in the field Enrapturd as he sung He markt the mellow swell How sweet the early notice rung From mornings tolling bell &amp; on his ears how soft &amp; sweet The cows did low &amp; sheep did bleat &amp; on the waking gales How maids sung oer their pales &amp; markt too in his ryhmes How musical betimes From mowers wetting sycthe in meadow ground Came murmring oer the ear a sharp shill tinkling sound &amp; the long day how labour wore away How swains &amp; maidens mixt to make the hay The sun burnt beauty wi her ruddy face How coy she seemd to shun each rude embrace But when unseen behind a cock of hay Or smutty even round their armours fell Was known to stay behind wi chaps to play To kiss &amp; toy &amp; likd it monstrous well &amp; somthing more then what his songs dare say &amp; the departing day he sat &amp; sung How the sun reddnd ere it left the eye How it enlargd &amp; like a huge ball hung Seemly on nothing in the dripping skye Till all at once it hurried from the sight Behind the dim seen wood or misty mountains height Nor sunk unseen its last expiring beam That faintly shone &amp; dyd upon the stream He markt too on his seat how sweet did creep The wimpering waters oer each pebly swell Soft as a nurse song oer the infants sleep He lovd its murmurs well 29 &amp; lubin had his lamentable tale His songs oft bitterd wi the ways of woe For lubins self was nursd in sorrows vale &amp; early learnd the ills of life to know From pain &amp; toil &amp; poverty that flow So copiously in lifes low humble sphere Oft woud his feelings meet the poor mans woe Oft woud he sigh the beggars wants to hear &amp; pity all she coud woud drop a tender tear Lubins sigh For the pauper [30] One winters morn bent oer his prop[p]ing stick A poor man met me on the rhymey lea Weak was he worn wi years &amp; faint &amp; sick The beggar seemd—alas no beggar he When he gun tell his mournfull history Misfortunes hand had brought its victim low Thrice happy thou who no misfortunes see His looks was hagged but they plain did show It once were his hard fate some kinder days to know [31] O weak &amp; bad I am the old man sed His wooly locks the while wi ryhme enrolld If I must perish for the wants of bread I cannot work it is so bitter cold I stood the winter once but now am old Ah child he said thou mayst enquire the cause My griefs are many but are easy told Wert thou my age thou neednt stand to pause &amp; blest woud be thy lot to know no parish laws [32] Far better days I might to memry fetch When I coud boast of strength to mow &amp; reap But all my joy was in misfortunes reach Im crippld now &amp; little use to weep God knows affliction tho it pricks me deep When thoughts look back—but what is past is past Twas mine of woe instead of joy to reap &amp; now thou seest mans wreck reducd at last On whom age woe &amp; want combind pour down a double blast [33] My storys short &amp; easily explaind When I was young like thee the world was sweet Health flusht the cheek which grief had never staind &amp; pleasure strewd her flowers beneath my feet &amp; joys when manhood came needs no repeat I then was strong ah strength—loves worth endears In every master then a friend to meet But who can harken wi out shedding tears To poor mans wants &amp; woes in ages helpless years [34] When labour scarce its barley crust supplies Worn to its latest feeblest thread like mine When forcfull want on brutish aid relys (O loath were I my labour to resign) When far worse pains I meet then pain to pine When tottering limbs by age &amp; toil brought down No pity meets—O may nor thee nor thine Know the sad anguish of a parish frown To be like me lost wretch beholden to a town 35 As most of natures children prove to be His little soul was easy made to smart His tear was quickly born to sympathy &amp; soon was rousd the feelings of his heart In others woes &amp; wants to bear a part Yon parish huts where want is shuvd to dye He never viewd em but his tear woud start He past not by the doors wi out a sigh &amp; felt but every woe of workhouse misery 36 O poverty thy frowns was early dealt On him who mournd thee not by fancy led To whine &amp; wail oer woes he never felt Staining his ryhmes wi tears he never shed &amp; heaving sighs a mock song only bred Alas he knew too much of every pain That showrd full thick on his unshelterd head &amp; as his tears &amp; sighs did erst complain His numbers took it up &amp; wept it oer again 37 Full well might he [h]is early days recall When he a thresher wi his seive has been When he a ploughboy in the fields did maul &amp; drudgd wi toil thro a'most every scene How pincht wi winters frownings he has been &amp; tell of all that modesty consceals Of all his friends &amp; he has felt &amp; seen But usless naming what distress reveals As every child of want feels all that lubin feels 38 It might be curious too to hint the lad How in his earliest days he did apear Mean was the dress in which the boy was clad His friends so poor &amp; clo'hs excessive dear They oft were foild to rig him once a year &amp; huswifes care in many a patch was seen Much industry gen want did presevere His friends tryd all to keep him neat &amp; clean Tho care has often faild &amp; shatterd oft hes been 39 Yet oft fair prospects cheerd his parents dreams Who had on lubin founded many a joy But pinching want soon baffld all their schemes &amp; draggd him from the school a hopless boy To shrink unheeded under hard employ When struggling efforts warmd him up the while To keep the little toil coud not destroy &amp; oft wi books spare hours he woud beguile &amp; blunderd oft wi joy round crusoes lonly isle 40 Folks much may wonder how the thing may be That lubins taste shoud seek refined joys &amp; court the 'chanting smiles of poesy Bred in a village full of strife &amp; noise Old sensless gossips &amp; blackguarding boys Ploughmen &amp; threshers whose discourses led To nothing more then labours rude employs 'Bout work being slack &amp; rise &amp; fall of bread &amp; who were like to dye ere while &amp; who were like to wed 41 Houswives discoursing bout their hens &amp; cocks Spin[n]ing long stories wearing half the day Sad deeds bewailing of the prowling fox How in the roost the thief had knawd his way &amp; made their market profits all a prey &amp; other losses too the dames recite Of chick &amp; duck &amp; gosling gone astray All falling prizes to the swopping kite &amp; so the story runs its round both morning noon &amp; night 42 Nor sabath days no better thoughts instill The true going churchman hears the signal ring &amp; takes his book his homage to fulfill &amp; joins the clerk his amen task to sing &amp; rarley home forgets the text to bring &amp; soon as service ends he gins agen Bout signs in weather late or forward spring Of prospects good or bad in growing grain &amp; if the parsons speech be long they wait its end wi pain 43 A more uncoothly lout was hardly seen Beneath the shroud of ignorance then he The sport of all the village has he been Who wi his simple looks oft jested free &amp; gossips gabbling oer their cake &amp; tea Time a'ter time did prophesies repeat How half a ninney he was like to be To go so soodling up &amp; down the street &amp; shun the playing boys when ere they chancd to meet 44 When summer reignd how eager has he sped Where silence reignd &amp; the old crowned tree Bended its sheltering ivy oer his head &amp; summer breezes breathing placidly Encroachd upon the stock doves privacy Parting the leaves that screend her russet breast ‘Peace’ woud he wisper ‘dread no thief in me’ &amp; never rose to rob her carless nest Compassions softness reignd &amp; warmd his gentle breast 45 &amp; he woud trace the stagnant pond or lake Where flags sprung up or water lillies smild &amp; wipe the boughs aside of bush &amp; brake &amp; creep the woods wi sweetest scenes beguild Tracking some channel on its journey wild Where dripping bluebells on the bank did weep O what a lovley scene to natures child Through roots &amp; oer dead leaves to see it creep Watching on some mossd stump in contemplation deep 46 Twas pleasing too when meadows browning swath Neath sultry sunbeams witherd on the lea To mark the ploughboys at their sunday bath When leisure left em at their wading free In some clear pit hemd round wi willow tree &amp; bush &amp; brake to screen the dabblers grew Tho bashful milkmaids coudnt help but see &amp; doubtless blushing by the naked crew Their bosoms might be warmd to wish a nearer view 47 &amp; he woud mark in Julys rosey prime Crossing the meadows how a namless flye O[f] scarlet plumage puntual to its time Percht on a flower woud always meet his eye &amp; plain drest butter flye of russet dye As if a wakend by the scythes shill sound Soon as the bent wi ripness gan to dye Was constant with him in each meadow ground Flirting the withering swath &amp; unmown blossom round 48 No inscet scapt him from the gaudy plumes Of dazzling butterflyes so fine to view To the small midgen that at evening comes Like dust spots dancing oer the waters blue Or where the spreading oak above head grew Tormenting maidens neath their kicking cow Who often murmurs at the elfin crew &amp; spoils their gambols wi a switching bough 49 &amp; he has markt the curious stained rings Tho seemly nothing in anothers eye &amp; bending oer em thought em wonderous things Where nurses night fays circling dances hie &amp; set the cock to watch the mornings eye Light soon betrays em where their routs has been Their printing foot marks leave a magic dye The grass grows gloomy in a darker green &amp; look for years to come &amp; still the place is seen 50 &amp; as the clining day his stalking shade A jiant monster stretcht in fancys view What bustle to his cottage has he made Ere sliving night around his journey threw Her circling curtains of a grizly hue &amp; on the rings the fairy routs displayd From gossips wisdom much he gleand &amp; knew Who told him haunts for ghosts as well as fays &amp; what quere things were seen in grannys younger days 51 His song might tremble wi the haunted pond &amp; tell of terrors which his heart has found How he to 'scape shoold many a pace beyond Each dreaded dangerous spot of Haunted ground Here as he passt where amys woes were drownd If late at night his fears woud turn him chill If nought was seen he heard a squish squash sound As when ones shoes drencht in water will &amp; wet &amp; dripping he oft see her climb the hill 52 &amp; round his fields lay many a spot to dread Twoud note a history down to note em all Oft monsters have been seen wi out a head &amp; market men oft got a dangerous fall When startld horses saw the sweeping pall On the cross roads where love lorn luce was lain At other spots like offsprings of old ‘ball’ As such full oft by 'staken ploughmen taen A shagged foal will fright the early rising swain &amp; lubins fields had spots for wizard fame Full oft hes heard the ploughing chaps declare How in the shape of ‘Straws theve playd their game’ Till in white larder sweated horse or man How beesom sticks went hurtling thro the air Trays too coud not stan' quiet on the moore &amp; sheep cribs oft have been there coaches there Still nurses have a spell they cant get oer &amp; oft the horse shoes seen naild on the village door 53 In autumn time how oft hes stood to mark What tumults tween the hogs &amp; geese arose Down the corn litterd street &amp; the rude bark Of jealous watch dog on his masters clo'hs Een rousd by quawkings of the swopping crows &amp; every tinkle in that busy toil In sultry field &amp; dusty lane that flows He gleand his corn &amp; lovd to list the while For lubins self was mixt to share of autumns spoil 54 &amp; when old women overpowrd by heat Tuckt up their tails &amp; sickend at the toil Seeking beneath the thorn the mole hill seat To tell their tales &amp; catch their breath awhile Their gabbling talk did lubins cares beguile &amp; some woud tell their tales &amp; some woud sing &amp; many a dame to make the children smile Woud tell of many a funny laughing thing While merrily the snuff box charm went pinching round the ring 55 Here lubin listn'd wi a struck supprise When hickerthrifts great strength has met his ear How he killd jiants as they were but flies &amp; lifted trees as one woud lift a spear &amp; not much bigger then his fellows where He knew no troubles waggoners have known Of getting stalld &amp; such dissasters drear Up hed chuck sacks as one woud hurl a stone &amp; draw whole loads of grain unaided &amp; alone 56 &amp; goodys sympathy woud fetch the tear From each young listner seated by her side When cruel barbary allen they did hear The haughty stubbornness of female pride To that fond youth who broke his heart &amp; dyd &amp; jack the jiant killers tales shed say Which still the same enchanting power supplyd The stagnant tear amazment wipd away &amp; jacks exploits were felt for many an after day 57 These were such tales as lubin did delight But shoud the muse narate in goodys strain &amp; tell of all she told from morn till night Fays ghosts &amp; jiants woud her songs detain &amp; be at days return resumd again Wi cinderella she has charmd awhile Then Thumbs dissasters gev a moments pain Thus true thought legends woud each soul beguile As superstition willd to raise the tear or smile 58 &amp; as the load joggd hom ward down the lane When welcome night shut out the toiling day His followings markt the simple hearted swain Joying to listen on his homward way As rests warm rapture rousd the rustics lay The thread bare ballad from each quavering tongue As ‘peggy bond’ or the ‘sweet month of may’ As how he joyd to hear each ‘good old song’ That on nights pausing ear did echo loud &amp; strong 59 The muse might sing too for he well did know The freaks &amp; plays that harvest home doth end How the last load is crownd wi boughs &amp; how Wi floating ribbons diznd at their end The swains &amp; maids wi fork &amp; rake attend &amp; how the children on the load delight Wi shouts of harvest home their throats to rend &amp; how the dames peep out to mark the sight &amp; all the feats that crown the harvest supper night 60 He knew all well a young familiar there &amp; often lookd on all for he him sen Mixt wi the sun tand group the feast to share As years rolld round him wi the change agen &amp; brought the masters equals wi their men Who pusht the beer about &amp; smoakd &amp; drank Wi freedoms plenty never shown till then Nor labourers dard but now so free &amp; frank To laugh &amp; joke &amp; play so many an harmless prank 61 Much has he laughd each rude rude act to see The long neckt sheet clad crane to poke about Spoiling each smokers pipe &amp; cunningly Tho blindfold seen to pick each bald head out &amp; put each bashful maiden to the rout The ‘firey parrot’ too a laughing scene Where two maids on a sheet invite the lout Thrown oer a watertub to sit between &amp; as he drops they rise &amp; let him swearing in 62 The ‘dusty miller’ playing many a rig &amp; the ‘scotch pedlars’ wi their jokes &amp; fun The ‘booted hogs’ drove over ‘lunnon brig’ Boys who had mischief in the harvest done As loads oerturnd &amp; foul on posts had run &amp; brandy burning ghosts most deadly blue That each old woman did wi terror shun These wi the rest did lubin yearly view &amp; joind his mirth &amp; fears wi the low vulgar crew 63 To close the ranting night the masters health Went round in bumping horns to every swain Who wisht him best of crops to 'crease his wealth &amp;'s merry sport when harvest came again &amp; all i' chorus rallyd out amain &amp; soons the song (a tugging pull) begun Each ere its end the brimming horn must drain Or have it filld again—there lay the fun Till hodge went drunk to bed &amp; morts of things wer done 64 O dear to lubin autumns changing cloud Where shade &amp; sunshine every minute sees &amp; each rude risen tempest beetling loud Ownd every murmur his wild ear to please Sueing its vengance thro the yellow trees Pattering the acorns from their cups adown Fanning the sear leaf far upon the leas &amp; picturesque to him each scrambling clown Tearing the woods among to search the nut bunch brown 65 How woud he wander round the woods the plains When every flower from natures wreath had fled Tracing the shower bedimpld sandy lanes &amp; winding fountains to their infant bed Wi many a flag &amp; rushy bunch bespread Marking each curdle boil &amp; boil away &amp; bubbles guggling born that swelld &amp; fled Like changing scenes in lifes empherion day Thus lubin pausd &amp; cheerd his solitary way 66 A Solitair thro autumns wan decay He heard the tuteling robin sound her knell 'Serv'd the coy sun more shoy to slink away &amp; lingering oak shade how it brownd &amp; fell &amp; many a way of nature he coud tell That still are secrets to un'scerning eyes As how the bee most carful closd her cell How mice wi far fetchd ear their hole supplies &amp; moles root deeper down from winters frowning skies 67 &amp; he coud tell as how the squirrel far'd Who often stood its busy toils to see How he gen winters wants were well prepard Wi many a store in hollow root or tree As if bin told how winters wants woud be Its nuts &amp; acorns he woud often find &amp; hips &amp; hawes too heaped plentiously In snug warm corner that broke off the wind Wi leafy nest made nigh that warm green mosses lind 68 Twas thus his fond enquirey usd to trace Thro natures secrets wi unwear[i]ed eye &amp; watch the shifting seasons changing grace Springs first wild flower &amp; summers painted sky The inscet creeping &amp; the birds that flye The autumns dying breeze the winter wind That bellowd round his hut most mournfully &amp; as his years increasd his taste refind &amp; fancy wi new charms enlightnd up his mind 69 Beauty gan look too witching on his eye The sweetest image seen in natures glass A swelling bosom neath its lilly dye Wi out admiring lubin coudnt pass &amp; down cast eye &amp; blush of shanny lass Had every power his heart to hold in thrall —O beautious woman still thy charms surpass In spite of all thy failings &amp; thy fall Thou art the comfort still that charms this earthly ball 70 Sure twas an over sight in natures plan Such lovliness that claims the tenderest care Left thus defencless wi ungratfull man Such hardnd brutes as but too many are O pleasing flowers as frail as ye are fair Sure some that lives have souls to feel &amp; sigh When shrinking neath the storms ye cannot bear Your beautious buds bow down to fade &amp; dye While not one pitying tear melts your seducers eye 71 Full oft to see these witcheries divine Hed mix in circles where their charms did grace &amp; merry routs he now began to join &amp; tho his heart denyd to own its case It oft were smitten wi a beauty face &amp; throbbd wi thrilling agravating pain &amp; many a long long day has taken place Ere he forgot &amp; met his peace again While oft in beautys praise the while he hummd full many a strain 72 He knew the manners too of merry rout Statute &amp; feast his village yearly knew &amp; glorious revels too wi out a doubt Such pastimes were to hob &amp; nat &amp; sue Milkmaids &amp; clowns that statute joys pursue &amp; rattle of[f] like hogs to lunon mart Weary of old they seek for places new Where men hail maidens wi a frothing quart &amp; hodge wi sweet heart fixt forgets his plough &amp; cart 73 Where cakes &amp; nuts &amp; ginger bread &amp; all Tempt clowns to buy &amp; far more tempting still Where shining ribbons dizen out the stall &amp; wenches drag poor sheepish bob or bill Some long long dallied promise to fulfill New wreath or bow for sunday cap to buy ‘If yah set any store by one yah will’ Each strings his purse &amp; makes me no reply But thinks returns at night will suit for clowns are smuttly sly 74 &amp; there the ballad singers rave &amp; rant &amp; hodge whose pockets wornt stand treats more high Hears which his simpering lass may please to want &amp; brushing thro' the crowd most manfully Outs wi his pence the pleasing song to buy &amp; crams it in her hand wi many a smile The trifling present makes the maid comply To promise him her company the while &amp; strutting by her side at night he hands her oer the stile 75 While the poor sailor wi his hat in hand Hops thro the crowd that wonerfully stares To hear him talk of things in foreign land Bout thundering cannons &amp; most bloody wars &amp; as he stops to show his seamy scars Pity soon meets the ploughmans penny then The sailor heartfelt thankfulness declares ‘God blesses’ all &amp; stiles em gentlemen &amp; sobs his money up well pleasd &amp; gins his tale agen 76 Heres ‘civil will’ too wi his ‘pins’ &amp; ‘pegs’ &amp; he makes glorious fun among the chaps ‘Boys miss my pegs’ he cries ‘&amp; hit my legs ‘My timbers well can stand your gentle taps’ Tho sure enough he gets most ugly raps For here the rustic thinks the sports abound Whose aim at ‘civils’ legs his fellow caps Meets most applause—still ‘poor will’ stans his ground ‘Boys throw your copper salve’ he cries &amp; make another wound 77 But soldiers theyre the boys to make the rout Wi boasting bottle brimd wi jin or rum The high crownd cap wi ribbons hung about The tuteling fife &amp; hoarse rap tapping drum Lud clowns are almost mad where ere they come Theyre like so many kings mong country folk Their beer they push like water round the room Who will &amp; welcome there may drink &amp; smoke Tho Chaps has often found they even sell a joke 78 The bumptious serjan strouts before his men &amp; ‘clear the road young wopstraws’ will he say &amp; look as big as if king george him sen &amp; wield his sword around to make away Wi lace &amp; ribbons diznd out so gay So flashing smart—full oft as wells the swain The tempted maid his finery does betray Who leaves poor slighted hodge behind in pain &amp; many a chiding dame to sorrow &amp; complain 79 &amp; lubin heard the echo rabbld fight When men &amp; maids were hird &amp; sports did close As wenches lookt their sweethearts up at night &amp; found 'em drunk bedeckt wi soldiers clo'hs As they woud pull &amp; scold great tumults rose The serjants honour totterd terribly The womens threatnings hardly scapd wi blows —Theyd box his cap about his ears if he Gave not the contest up &amp; set the prisoner free 80 Some homward bound were coupld maid &amp;

lowly rural subjects such as these Must have its simple ways &amp; feats diserning eyes to pleas[e] 82 The lovly morn in Julys blushes rose That brought the yearly feast &amp; holliday When villagers put on their bran new clo'ths &amp; milk maids drest like any ladies gay Threw ‘cotton drabs’ &amp; ‘worsted hoes’ away &amp; left their pails unscourd well pleasd I ween To join the dance where gipsey fidlers play Accompanyd wi thumping tambereen From night till morning light upon the rushy green 83 Where the fond swain delighteth in the chance To meet the sun tand lass he dearly loves &amp; as he leads her down the giddy dance Wi many a token his fond passion proves Squeezing her hands or catching at her gloves &amp; stealing kisses as chance prompts the while Wi eye fixt on her as she gracful moves To catch if such fond ways does her beguile When happily her heart confesses in a smile 84 O rural love as spotless as the doves No wealth gives fuel to a borrowd flame To prompt the shepherd where to chuse his loves &amp; go a forger of that sacred name Both hearts in unison here beat the same Here nature makes the choice which love inspires Far from the wedded lord &amp; haughty dame This boon of heavenly happiness retires Not felon like law bound but wedded in desires 85 The woodman &amp; the thresher now is found Mixing &amp; making merry wi his friends Childern &amp; kin from neighbouring towns around Their humble banquet at the feast attends For such to nought of costliness pretends Yet somthing more then common they provide &amp;

good luck may ye see 89 Thus talkd the father to his pipe &amp; beer For those whom hed admonish were the while Too occupyd in dancing him to hear Yet still wi talk &amp; beer he does beguile His short releasment from his cares &amp; toil Till Sir Johns spirit stops his merry glee &amp; lays him quiet down—his children smile Brakes up the dance &amp; pays the fiddlers fee &amp; then till morn the lass he loves each swain pulls on his knee 90 &amp; the long rural string of merry games That at such outings maketh much ado All wore to lubins skill familiar names &amp; he coud tell each whole performance thro As pland &amp; practisd by the jovial crew —Great sport to them was jumping in a sack For beaver hat bedeckt wi ribbons blue Soon one bumps down as tho hed broke his neck &amp;

of beer While money lasts they shout about for more Resolvd to keep it merry when its here As toil comes every day &amp; feasts but once a year 96 Wi village merriments digressd awhile We'll now resume his native joys again &amp; aptly find him bending oer a stile Or stretchd in sabbath musings on the plain Looking around &amp; humming oer a strain Painting the foliage of the woodland trees Listing a bird thats lost its nest complain Noting the hummings of the passing bees &amp; all the lovly things his musings hears &amp; sees 97 Where ling clad heaths &amp; pastures now may spread He oft has heard of castle &amp; of hall &amp; oft curosity his steps hath led To gaze on some old arch or fretting wall Where ivy scrambles up to stop the fall There woud he sit him down &amp; look &amp; sigh &amp; bye gone days back to his mind woud call The bloody war[r]ing times of chivallry When danes invading routs made unarmd britons flye 98 He lovd to view the mossy arched brigs Bending oer wall or rail the pits or springs Below to mark where willows dripping twigs To summers silken zephers feeblest wings Bent i' the flood &amp; curvd its thousand rings &amp; where the sun beam twitterd on the walls &amp; nodding bulrush down its drowk head hings &amp; down the rock the shallow water falls Wild fluttering thro the stones in feeble wimpering brawls 99 &amp; oft wi shepherds leaning oer their hooks Hed stand conjecturing on the ruins round Tho little skilld in antiquated books Their knowledge in such matters seemd profound &amp; they woud preach of what did once abound Castles deep moated round old haunted hall &amp; somthing like to moats still swamps the ground As neath old cromwells rage the towers did fall &amp; bush &amp; ivy creeps the hill &amp; ruin hides it all 100 &amp; ancient songs hes hung enrapturd on Which herdsmen on a hill has sat to sing Bout feats of robin hood &amp; little john Whose might was feard by country &amp; by king Such strength had they to twich the thrumming string Their darts oft suckt the life blood of the deer &amp; sherwood forest wi their horns did ring Ah these where such that he did joy to hear &amp; these where such that warmd when antique scenes did 'pear 101 Thy moat o woodcroft &amp; thy time bleachd towers Whose hughe head over looks the level green He oft has viewd em as he pluckt his flowers King cup &amp; daisey ah &amp; joyd has been To list the passing netherds tale between An ancient story scores of years by gone Perils thou met wi in thy early days In cromwells time or doubtless rebel john The times he were not leard to know but let the tale go on Woodcroft Castle: The Netherds tale 1 The night in yon castle now lulls the clowns sleep &amp; returns him in peace to his plough Tho the shepherd unskard sits in rest wi his sheep &amp; the maid sings her song neath her cow There once was an hour a most terrible hour When the shepherd &amp; ploughmen has fled When the centinel stood wi his gun at the door &amp; the maiden was scard from her bed 2 Tho now ducks &amp; geese they do swim i' the moat &amp; the beast at their cribs left to feed Tho the tower nows of no other use then a coat For the pigeons to roost in &amp; breed There once was a day a most terrible day When that moat it flowd bloody wi all When the top of yon tower saw the midst of the fray &amp; the cannons made totter the wall 3 It might be when charles our unfortunate king Was disdaind by each rebel out law That one michael Hudson his soldiers did bring To keep our low country in awe Tho few trusty fellows there was in the land To royalty he was a friend &amp; valiant as ever was sword put in hand Or master on man might depend 4 This very old castle he came to comand A staunch set of servants brought he Ere theyd loose it by rebels theyd loose their right hand Or their legs lopped off to their knee They 'fended it stoutly &amp; watchd at the gate Where draw bridge there might be as then &amp; hudson I ween were up early &amp; late A watching the foe wi his men 5 Twas when dewy morn on the pasture did weep From stamford the rebels did roam Their tumults no doubt scamperd shepherds &amp; sheep &amp; great rout they made as they come They rallied thro helpstone ah helpstone I ween Thou neer knew a rebel before &amp; great consternation no doubt thou wast in As the marston chaps were on the moor 6 Ive heard gossips say when such news spread about The maidens near fell into fits &amp; old women hearing the rebels were out Was a'most scard out of their wits The mizer tore slabs up &amp; buried his coin &amp; granny she instantly fell To hide what she thought the bold rogues woud purloin Such as kettles &amp; pots in the well 7 But surely if I had been then on the green Employd (markd the herdsman) as now Id took to my heels soon as rebels Id seen &amp; left em free choice of a cow &amp; doubtless the netherds might run—&amp; the rout Full easy came in for their prey &amp; as they flockt up to the castle no doubt Thought its tenants as easy as they 8 But hudson soon let em to know they was wrong As his brandishd sword threats did despise He told em that conquest wa'n't made by a tongue But swords cut the way to the prize &amp; instant the hot bloody battle begun &amp; hudson so heartnd his men That the rebels repulsd stood on tiptoe to run Tho numberd as thirty to ten 9 But vain are the swords &amp; the deeds of the brave When cowards wi numbers oerpower As vain hopes the flye to scape fish on the wave Or thistle down float in a shower They forded the moat &amp; thought conquest was bought Ah then came the terrible hour When the bold royal captives subdued as they thought Pusht again from the top of the tower 10 Repulse so undaunted—the rebels dismayd Offerd quarter for battle to end &amp; then was thy guardians o woodcroft betrayd Ah who woud on cowards depend The valiant comander was cowardly flung From off the tower top by the foe His hand they slashd off on the tower as he hung &amp; his body fell bleeding below 11 &amp; one who had quakd coud he usd his right hand As many at nelson has done When he begd like a soldier to dye on dry land Dashd him dead i the flood wi his gun &amp; this is the tale woud make any one weep Bout the towers thou so often has seen That neerll be forgot while a shepherd tends sheep Or netherd keeps cows on the green 102 Thus did the swain the dismal tale relate While lubins breast wi tenderest woes did bleed Much did he sigh to hear the valiants fate &amp; marveld much that cruel wars shoud breed So nigh his natal home the horrid deed &amp; soon the tale his wild research supplyd Like artless maidens who romances read Each ruind heap was castles now discryd Were other hudsons bore comand &amp; fought as brave &amp; dyd 103 But who can tell the anguish of his mind When reformations formidable foes Wi civil wars on natures peace combind &amp; desolation struck her deadly blows As curst improvment gan his fields inclose O greens &amp; fields &amp; trees farwell farwell His heart wrung pains his unavailing woes No words can utter &amp; no tongue can tell When ploughs destroyd the green when groves of willows fell 104 There once was springs when daises silver studs Like sheets of snow on every pasture spread There once was summers when the crow flower buds Like golden sunbeams brightest lustre shed &amp; trees grew once that shelterd lubins head There once was brooks sweet wimpering down the vale The brooks no more—king cup &amp; daiseys fled Their last falln tree the naked moors bewail &amp; scarce a bush is left around to tell the mournful tale 105 Yon flaggy tufts &amp; many a rushy nott Existing still in spite of spade &amp; plough As seemly fond &amp; loath to leave the spot Tells where was once the green—brown fallows now Where lubin often turns a saddnd brow Marks the stopt brook &amp; mourns oppresions power &amp; thinks how once he waded in each slough To crop the yellow ‘horse blobs’ early flower Or catch the ‘millar thumb’ in summers sultry hour 106 There once was days the wood man knows it well When shades een echod wi the singing thrush There once was hours the ploughmens tale can tell When mornings beauty wore its earliest blush How woodlarks carrold from each stumpy bush Lubin himself has markd em soar &amp; sing The thorns are gone the woodlarks song is hush Spring more resembles winter now then spring The shades are banishd all—the birds betook to wing 107 There once was lanes in natures freedom dropt There once was paths that every valley wound Inclosure came &amp; every path was stopt Each tyrant fixt his sign were pads was found To hint a trespass now who crossd the ground Justice is made to speak as they command The high road now must be each stinted bound —Inclosure thourt a curse upon the land &amp; tastless was the wretch who thy existance pland 108 O england boasted land of liberty Wi strangers still thou mayst thy title own But thy poor slaves the alteration see Wi many a loss to them the truth is known Like emigrating bird thy freedoms flown While mongrel clowns low as their rooting plough Disdain thy laws to put in force their own &amp; every village owns its tyrants now &amp; parish slaves must live as parish kings alow 109 Ye fields ye scenes so dear to lubins eye Ye meadow blooms ye pasture flowers farwell Ye banishd trees ye make me deeply sigh Inclosure came &amp; all your glories fell Een the old oak that crownd yon rifld dell Whose age had made it sacred to the view Not long was left his childerns fate to tell Where ignorance &amp; wealth their course pursue Each tree must tumble down—old ‘lea close oak’ adieu 110 Lubin beheld it all &amp; deeply paind Along the railed road woud muse &amp; sigh The only path that freedoms rights maintaind The naked scenes drew pity from his eye Tears dropt to mem'ry of delights gone bye The haunts of freedom cowherds wattld bower &amp; shepherds huts &amp; trees that tow[e]red high &amp; spreading thorns that turnd a summer shower All captives lost &amp; past to sad oppresions power 111 &amp; oft wi shepherds he woud sit to sigh On past delights of many a by gone day &amp; look on scenes now naked to the eye &amp; talk as how they once were clothed gay &amp; how the runnel wound its weedy way &amp; how the willows on its margin grew Talk oer wi them the rural feats of may Who got the blossoms neath the morning dew That the last garland made &amp; where such blossoms grew 112 As how he coud remember well when he Laden wi blooming treasures from the plain Has mixt wi them beneath a dotterel tree Drove from his cowslips by a hasty rain &amp; heard em there sing each delightful strain &amp; how wi tales what joys they usd to wake Wishing wi them such days woud come again They lovd the artless boy for talking sake &amp; gave it out some future day a wondrous man hed make 113 &amp; you ye poor ragd out casts of the land That hug your shifting camps from green to green He lovd to see your humble dwelling stand &amp; thought your groups did beautify the scene Tho blamd for many a petty theft yeve been Poor wandering souls to fates hard want decreed Doubtless too oft such acts your ways bemean &amp; oft in wrong your foes 'gen you proceed &amp; brand a gipseys camp when others do the deed 114 Lubin woud love to list their gibberish talk &amp; view the oddity such ways display &amp; oft wi boys pursud his sunday walk Where warpt the camp beneath the willows grey &amp; its black tennants on the green sward lay While on two forked sticks wi cordage tyd Their pot oer pilferd fuel boils away Wi food of sheep that of red water dyd Or any nauceous thing their frowning fates provide 115 Tho oft they gather money by their trade &amp; on their fortune telling art subsist Where her long hurded groat oft brings the maid &amp; secret slives it in the sybils fist To buy good luck &amp; happiness—to list What occupys a wenches every thought Who is to be the man—while as she wist The gipsies tale wi swains &amp; wealth is fraught The lass returns well pleasd &amp; thinks all cheaply bought 116 Full oft in summer lubins markt &amp; seen How eagerly the village maids pursue Their sunday rambles where the camps have been &amp; how they gi' their money to the crew For idle stories they believe as true Crossing their hands wi coin or magic stick How quakt the young to hear what things they knew While old experiencd dames knew all the trick Who said that all their skill was borrowd from old nick 117 &amp; thus the superstitious dread their harm &amp; neer dare fail relieving their distress Lest they wi in their cot shoud leave a charm To let nought prosper &amp; bring on distress Great depth of cunning gipseys do posses &amp; when such weakness in a dame they find Forsooth they prove most terryfying guess &amp; tho not one to charity inclind They mutter black revenge &amp; force her to be kind 118 His native scenes o sweet endearing sound Sure neer a heart does beat howere forlorn But the warmd breast has soft emotions found To cherish the dear spot where it was born Een the poor hedger in the early morn Chopping the pattering bushes hung wi dew Scarce lays his mitten on a branching thorn But painfull mem'ry banishd thoughts renew Reminding when't was young what happy days he knew 119 When the old shepherd wi his wooly locks Crosses the green past joys his eyes will fill Where when a boy he usd to tend his flocks Each fringed rushy bed &amp; swelling hill Where he has playd or stretchd him at his will Freshning anew on lifes declining years &amp; jogs his memory wi their pleasures still O how such things his native scenes endears No spot throughout the world to him so pleasingly appears 120 The toil worn thresher in his little cot Whose roof did shield his birth &amp; still remains His dwelling place how rough so ere his lot His toil tho hard &amp; small the wage he gains That many a child most piningly mentains Send him to distant scenes &amp; better fare How woud his bosom yearn wi parting pains How woud he turn &amp; look &amp; linger there &amp; wish een now his cot &amp; poverty to share 121 How dear to soldiers does the relic prove Took from his cot or gave by loves sweet hand A box that bears a motto of true love How will he take his quid &amp; musing stand Think on his native lass &amp; native land &amp; bring to mind all those past joys again From which wild youth so foolish was trepand Kissing the pledge that all these ways retain While fancy points the spot far oer the barring main 122 O dear delightfull spots his native place How lubin lookd upon the days gone bye How he tho young woud past delights retrace Bend oer gulld holes where stood his trees &amp; sigh Wi tears the while bemoistning in his eye How hed look for the green a green no more Mourning to scenes that made him no reply Save the strong accents they in memory bore ‘Our scenes that charmd thy youth are dead to bloom no more’ 123 O samely naked leas so bleak so strange How woud he wander oer ye to complain &amp; sigh &amp; wish he neer had known the change To see the plough share bury all the plain &amp; not a cows lip on its lap remain The rush tuft gone that hid the sky larks nest Ah when will may morn hear such strains again The storms beats chilly on his naked breast No shelter grows to shield him now no home invites to rest 124 ‘Ah’ woud he sigh ‘ye neath the churchyard grass ‘Ye sleeping shepherds coud ye rise again ‘&amp; see what since your time has come to pass ‘See neer a bush nor willow now remain ‘Looking &amp; listning for the brook in vain ‘Yed little think as such your natal scene ‘Yed little now distinguish field from plain ‘Or where to look for each departed green ‘All ploughd &amp; buried now as tho there nought had been 125 But still they beamd wi beautys on his eye &amp; other scenes wa'n't half so sweet to view &amp; other flowers but strove in vain to vie Wi his few tufts that scap'd the wreck &amp; grew &amp; sky larks too their singing might pursue To claim his praise—he coud but only say Their songs were sweet but not like those he knew That charmd his native plains at early day Whose equals neer was found where ere his steps might stray 126 When distant village feast or noisey fair Short abscence from his fields did him detain How woud he feel when home he did repair &amp; mixt among his joys—the white spire fane Meeting his eye above the elms again Leaving his friends in the sweet summer night No longer lost on unknown field or plain Far from the pad wi well known haunts in sight Hed stray for scatterd flowers wi added new delight 127 As travellers returnd from foreign ground Feels more endearments for his native earth So lubin cherishd from each weary round Still warmer fondness for those scenes of mirth Those plains &amp; that dear cot which gave him birth &amp; oft this warmness for his fields hed own Mixd wi his friends around the cottage hearth Relating all the travels he had known &amp; that hed seen no spot so lovly as his own 128 Nor has his taste wi manhood ere declind Yell now oft see him on his lonly way Oer stile or gate in thoughtfull mood reclind Or long the road wi folded arms to stray Mixing wi autumns sighs or summer gay &amp; curious natures secrets to explore Brushing the twigs of wood or copse away To roam the lonely shade so silently Sweet muttering oer his joys from clowns intrusions free 129 Ah who can tell the anxiousness of mind As now he doth to manhoods cares aspire The future blessings which he hopes to find The wisht for prospects of his hearts desire &amp; how chill fear oft damps the glowing fire &amp; oer hopes sunshine spread a cloudy gloom Yet foild &amp; foild hopes still his songs inspire &amp; like the daisey on the cotters tomb In mellancholy scenes he 'joys his cheerless bloom 130 He has his friends compard to foes tho few &amp; like a cornflower in a field of grain Mong many a foe his wild weeds ope to view &amp; malice mocks him wi a rude disdain Proving pretensions to the muse as vain They deem her talents far beyond his skill &amp; hiss his efforts as some forged strain But as hopes smile their tongues shall all be still Een envy turns a friend when shes no power to kill 131 Ah as the traveller from the mountain top Looks down on misty kingdoms spread below &amp; meditates beneath the steepey drop What life &amp; lands exist &amp; oceans flow How feign that hour the anxious soul woud know Of all his eye beholds—but its in vain So lubin eager views this world of woe &amp; wishes time her secrets woud explain If he may live for joys to come or sink in welming pain 132 Fates close kept thoughts wi in her bosom hide She is no gossip secrets to betray Times steady movements must her end descide &amp; leave him painfull still to hope the day &amp; group thro ignorance his doubtful way By wisdoms disregard &amp; fools anoyd &amp; if no worth anticipates the lay Then let his childish notions be destroyd &amp; he his time employ as erst its been employd 133 Thiss far intruded lubins tale shall close Small joy wi whats to come to interfere Where he in silent sorrow broods his woes As manhoods painful prime approaches near &amp; drops on troubles its unheeded tear Tho now &amp; then may hope beguile his way &amp; the low muse his sleepless night may cheer Ere while suffice it to renew the lay When fortune finds him out in some far welcome day CAUPER GREEN Now eves hours hot noons succeed &amp;

smacking whip Boys loud bawls of ‘rose’ &amp; ‘hip’ All are silent free from care Welcome boon of night to share Pleasd I wander from the town Pestered by the selfish clown Whose whole learnings hogs &amp; cows Horses best for carts &amp; ploughs Whose talk tho spun the night about Hogs cows &amp; horses spins it out Far from these so low so vain Glad I wind me down the lane Where a deeper gloom pervades Tween the hedges narrow shades Where a mimic night hour spreads Neath the ash groves meeting heads Onward there I glad proceed Where the inscet &amp;

such might be the cause Sweet the fragments to observe Times so kind as to preserve Wrecks the cowboy often meets On the mole hills thymy seats While by carless pulling weeds Chance unbares the shining beeds That to tastful minds display Relics of the druid day Opening on congecturing eyes Some lone hermits paradise Doubtless where as so it might Such like relics meet the sight On each self same spot of ground Where the cowboys beads are found Hermits once from worldly care Fled &amp; mossd a cottage there Livd on herbs that there abound Food &amp; phisic doubly found Herbs that have existance still In every vale on every hill Whose virtues only wi em dyd As rural life gave way to pride Doubtless too oblivions blot Blacks some sacred lonly spot ‘Cauper green’ as so it may That once was thine in early day Thou might hide thy pilgrims then From the plague of worldly men Thou might here posses thy cells Wholsome herbs &amp;

the night her gloomy pall Blackening flings tween earth &amp; sky Hiding all things from the eye Nor broken seam nor thin spun screen The moon can find to peep between When thy unmolested grass Untrackd even by the ass Spindld up its destind height Far too sour for stock to bite Drooping hangs each feeble joint Wi a glass nob on its point When the dewy laden brake Hiding holes the rabbits make Oer the narrow pathways neet Sops the shoes &amp;

trembling dropped in the corn The dew raisd flower was perk &amp; proud The butterflye around it playd The skyes blue clear save wooly cloud That passt the sun without a shade On the pismires castle hill While the burnet buttons quakd While beside the stone pavd rill Cowslap bunshes nodding shakd Bees in every peep did try Great had been the honey shower Soon their load was on their thigh Yellow dust as fine as flour Brazen magpies full of clack Fond of insolence &amp; sport Chattering on the donkeys back Percht &amp; pulld his shaggy coat Odd crows settld on the pad Dames from milking trotting home Said no sign was half so bad &amp; shakd their heads at ills to come While cows restless from the ground Plungd into the stream &amp; drank &amp; the rings went wirling round Till they toucht the flaggy bank On the arches wall I knelt Curious as I often did To see what the sculpture spelt But the moss its letters hid Labour sought the water cool &amp; stretching took a hearty sup The fish were playing in the pool &amp; turnd their milk white bellys up Cloths laid down behind a bush Wading close beside the pad Deeply did the maiden blush As she passd each naked lad Some with lines the fish to catch Querking boys let loose from school Others side the hedgrow watch Where the linnet took the wool Tending hodge had slept too fast While his things had strayd abroad Swift the freed horse gallopd past Pattering down the stoney road The gipsey tune was loud &amp; strong As round the camp they dancd a gig &amp; much I lovd the brown girls song While listing on the wooden brig The shepherd he was on his rounds The dog stopt short to lap the stream &amp; gingling in the fallow grounds The ploughman urgd his reaking team &amp; left free to every whim Which my rambling search coud meet Seeking joys that suited him Pleas'd I shar'd the shephards seat Counting hues in varied wings As each butterflye did pass Marking morts of namless things How they jumpt among the grass As he eat his crust of bread Wondering much when beetles stopt By what instinct they were led To the crumbles which he dropt Loading off in order free Trackless oer the fuzzy dust When he calld em ‘wise as we’ Sure enough I thought they must Often did I stop to gaze On each spot once dear to me Known mong those rememberd days Of banishd happy infancy Often did I view the shade Where once a nest my eyes did fill &amp; often markd the place I playd At ‘roley poley’ down the hill In the woods deep shade did stand As I passd the sticking troop &amp; goody begd a helping hand To heave her rotten faggot up The riding gate sharp gerking round Followd fast my heels again While echo mocks the clapping sound &amp; ‘clap clap’ sung the woods amain The wood is sweet I love it well In spending there my leisure hours To look the snail its painted shell &amp; search about for curious flowers Or neath the hazels leafy thatch On a stulp or mossy ground Little squirrels gambols watch Oak trees dancing round &amp; round Green was the shade—I love the woods When autumns wind is mourning loud To see the leaves float on the floods Dead within their yellow shroud The wood was then in glory spread I love the browning bough to see That litters autumns dying bed Her latest sigh is dear to me Neath a spreading shady oak For awhile to muse I lay From its grains a bough I broke To fan the teasing flies away Then I sought the woodland side Cool the breeze my face did meet &amp; the sun the shade did hide Tho twas hot it seemed sweet &amp; as while I clum the hill Many a distant charm I found Pausing on the lagging mill That scarcly movd its sails around Hanging oer a gate or stile Till my curious eye did tire Leisure was employd awhile Counting many a peeping spire While the hot sun gun to wain Cooling glooms fast deep[n]ing still &amp; freshning greeness spread the plain As black clouds crept the southern hill Labour sought a sheltering place Neath some thick wood woven bower While odd rain drops dampt his face Heralds of the coming shower Where the oak plank crosst the stream Which the early rising lass Climbs each morn wi gathering cream Crookd pads tracking thro the grass There where willows hing their boughs Briars &amp; black thorns formd a bower Stunted thick from sheep &amp; cows There I stood to shun the shower Sweet it was to feel the breeze Blowing cool without the sun Bumming gad flies ceasd to teaze All was glad the shower to shun Sweet it was to mark the flower Rain drops glistning on its head Perking up beneath the bower As if rising from the dead &amp; full sweet it was to look How clouds misted oer the hill Rain drops how they dimpt the brook Falling fast &amp; faster still While the gudgeons sturting bye Cringd neath water grasses shade Startling as each nimble eye Saw the rings the dropples made &amp; upon the dripping ground As the shower had ceasd again As the eye was wandering round Trifling troubles causd a pain Overtaken in the shower Bumble bees I wanderd bye Clinging to the drowking flower Left without the power to flye &amp; full often drowning wet Scampering beetles rac'd away Safer shelter glad to get Drownded out from whence they lay While the moth for nights reprief Waited safe &amp; snug withall Neath the plantains bowery leaf Where there neer a drop coud fall Then the clouds did wear again &amp; full sweet it was to view Sunbeams trembling long in vain Now they gun to glimmer thro' &amp; as labour strength regains From ales booning bounty given So revivd the freshning plains From the smiling showers of heaven Sweet the birds did chant their songs Blackbird linnet lark &amp;

neer Had heard of his dogs &amp; his arms Tho nothing to scare em as yet hadnt been Of any one tempting down right to get in But folks lunging round it at night time was seen Which left em suspisions of fear &amp; maids often sed when the rest were gone church That shagger-down fellows theyve seen on the lurch That tryd at the front door &amp; then at the porch &amp; begd in excuse bread or beer —O dear what sensations from solitude rise What trifles she loves that a town woud despise Een the squeakings of mice now the maidens woud prize &amp; thus when alone theyd sit down &amp; listen the chirp of the sparrows to hear &amp; think em then songs of the linnet more dear &amp; all those fine singers in solitude drear As they put em in mind of a town One day as it rather gets dusk at the hour When the winters days done all it can about four The thresher gave in &amp; had cleand up his floor &amp; took out the straw to the stock When three lusty fellows peept into his barn &amp; the right road for somwhere requested to learn Tho drest like three clowns twas a blackis[h] conscern &amp;

wi no But hinted on dogs &amp; the guns for a show For he had the deepness about him to know That such like woud frighten a thief They then lungd away wi out bidding good night Such tokens confirmd that his notions was right Pleasd enough too were he to get out of their sight &amp; instantly shut up his barn &amp; went to the servants &amp; told 'em his doubt Who cast their opinions &amp; then gave it out That men at that hour for no good came about Twas surely a hidden conscern Be't een as it woud they got ready for work To guard agen danger if peace shoud be broke They hunted up cutting knife cudgel &amp; fork &amp; drove all the dogs in the house Thus armd they were fixt let it be as it might &amp; doors they lockd up hard the windows shuts tight Each waited ast were upon thorns all the night &amp; listnd as still as a mouse Besure now &amp; then mutterd hints went about &amp; fis'es were shook to note somthing without Some fancyd a whistle some heard a shill shout &amp; some heard their steps in the yard Poor hog serving hodge frit to dead as it where A'most dreaded the supper job going to draw beer &amp; dursnt go down i' the cellar for fear The wind whistld hollow the weather was foul Round the jambs of the cottage the tempest did howl The dog rather restless gun grumble &amp; growl &amp; wagged their tails at the door The candle curld winding sheets dismal to view &amp; tokening danger the fire burned blue &amp; plump to the maidens the coffin sparks flew Which made em neer sink on the floor Footsteps pass the window! the bull dogs all bark Theres one shouts for cudgel &amp; one for a fork &amp; he take the gun who can best hit the mark &amp; thus they are fixt for alarm Som'at sorrowfull calls &amp; the door gis a tap Twas a voice like a womans—agen a small rap Poor hodge he woud have it twas nought but a trap Tho the voice sed it meant em no harm ‘Who ever ye be’ said the master ‘begone’ Some bawld for the gun to let know they had one &amp; some tapt the bull dogs to harden em on &amp; bragd of their savagness too The door haunter woudnt wi little be scar'd But still to come in begged terrible hard It told em theyd little need keeping a guard Twas small harm a woman coud do ‘The storm gatherd deep &amp; my road got unseen ‘Lost on the dark heath for an hour have I been ‘My limbs are most stiffnd it freezes so keen ‘Id be thankful to lye in yer barn’ The master was tender it melted his breast Who coudnt but pity a woman distrest He instant called counsil to give her some rest Lord knows twas a shocking conscern But hodge still presisted she meant em no good The maidens both backd him ‘keep safe while they coud’ &amp; vowd were they them let her wowl as she woud She neer shoud set foot i the lodge ‘Most votes the day carried’ wi caution &amp; guard A tall woman enterd the house the boy stard The stranger een smiled to see him so scard &amp; hard ran the jest upon hodge Still he eyed her all over from top to the toe &amp; jogd wi his elbow the maids to let know That her voice were to[o] gruff—women never talkd so Let the others consiet as they might Quere fancys he coudnt get out of his head As in crossing the house she seemd heavy to tread 'Sides her foot looked large—well he might go to bed But hed neer shut his eyes for the night They questiond the stranger she answerd em well Where bin &amp; where going far as questions compell But whod any sense in his head coud soon tell She were little to talking inclind She woudnt go bed &amp; good reasons were shown Her fatherless childern all sleeping alone She 'tended to start soon as first cock had crown For she coudnt be easy in mind The head man knew well bout the place whence she came &amp; knew too as well there was none of her name Had hodge or the maidens bin up to the same Theyd blobbd out the matter of course He answerd her nothing but kept up his eye &amp; found hidden mistery lapt up in the lye &amp; wisperd his master the hint by &amp; bye Who resolvd to scheme matters no worse Bed time cometh on man &amp; master sit up The womans but vainly intreeted to sup Poor hodge spite o fear begun drowsy &amp; droop &amp; she beggd theyd all go to their beds For her part she wisht cause no trouble at all The things that she begd of their kindness was small &amp; if she got worser she easy coud call —Excuse freshend doubts in their heads So now left on garrison master &amp; will The woman they thought got uneasier still But she said twas the thoughts of her babes made her ill As the youngest of four suckt her breast What leave sucking infants!—the clock tung eleven She wisht that the capons first signal was given The master &amp; man wisht em sens was in heaven New lies added dangers exprest She dozd now &amp; then on her chair she woud lye &amp; they found like the cat she coud doze wi one eye Nigh as fourpence a groat is the watches coud spy The plot were a roguish conscern &amp; they wisperd of fire arms in each others ear But wisperd as loud as the stranger shoud hear &amp; talkd of their guns as a store house it where As she all her perrils might learn Then to see what she woud do they made a mock sleep Dogs close to their master did watchfully keep The woman play[d] chances &amp; off did she creep As soft as she coud to the door The way that she went'd made any one dread She seemd as she wisht to have lightnd her tread As one strimes &amp; steps where sick folks lye a bed Her feet scarcly prest on the floor Doubts now were all cleard—out of doors she had got A shrill whistle blew—&amp; the master he shot &amp; will like an arrow brusht up to the spot &amp; agen turnd the key on their guest ‘All keep out as is out’ in triumph sed will A groan murmurd help a weak call faint &amp; chill Foot steps trampld gently—agen all were still Save the dogs who woud not be at rest The rout soon disturbd all the lodge of its rest The wenches for saftey rund nearly undrest &amp;

then as he thought &amp; his stick was prepard in his fist Some proposd take the gun &amp; go see if they coud Execution if twas done or not be as twoud But as now matters stood—hodge he votes for some good &amp; they from his caution desist First cock shouted morning aloud from his shed &amp; minded em all what the stranger had sed &amp; they deemd it rare luck as they didnt go bed To leave the guisd rogue to her sen The maids offerd prayers for thus being preservd The master reflected how theyd a been servd &amp; hodge in a moment most dryly observd Theyd none a seen daylight agen &amp; oft they calld silence now &amp; then the dogs growl But nothing was heard save the woop of an owl &amp; winds in the chimney—the weather was foul That mournfully wisperd alarm Hodge coudnt help hearing a whistle &amp; groan But night &amp; its terrors thank god they were flown The morning thro cracks of the window shuts shown &amp; light woud soon free em of harm The scales now was turnd &amp; in triumph hodge sed What scores of opinions he had in his head Which fearing theyd laugh at him worse then they had He kept em all in to his sen He knew very well that her bosom was flat Coud mark on her chin hairs as black as his hat Saw her pull down her bonnet to hide it &amp; that &amp; scarce coud help hinting agen The woman too slung herself back in her chair &amp; hodge sed he vain gogged will to look there Blue stockings she wore as to that he woud sware Which he neer saw on woman before &amp; once in her rocking she tosst up her feet He thought he saw breeches but kept it discreet &amp; thought as none else saw—his fears might consiet So he woudnt pretend to no more Hodge sed he thought much what he dare not express Twas a good for nought rogue in disguisd womans dress His wit pleasd the master who coudnt say less Then a worthy reward he shoud have &amp; all bragd of courage what each woud have done How that woud a servd em how this wi his gun Woud a rallied down two at a level like fun As all out of danger are brave When darkness grew thin &amp; the twilighty red Like beauty thro veils began dimly to spread They took up their weapons the stoutest hearts led &amp;

rooted the straw where it seemd in a heap As to dye out of sight any where she woud creep But the wounded encroacher was gone Holes &amp; corners they hunted for hours round &amp; round But nothing of rogues dead or living was found Tho sure enough some one had got a deep wound &amp; the living helpd off wi the lame The morn past opinions but nothing was heard All day the[y] expected but nothing appeard Hodge went to the village conjectures he heard But nothing for truth never came This friend &amp; that wi opinions ran oer Wi tidings of this that &amp; tother hurt sore They knew they was hurt but they knew nothing more Suspicion might think as she woud The farmer such stories did little regard But trebld the strength of his guns &amp;

Knowles Holland The beating snow clad bell wi sounding dead Hath clanked four—the woodmans wakd agen &amp; as he leaves his comfortable bed Dithers to view the ryhmey featherd pane &amp; shrugs &amp; wishes—but its all in vain The beds warm comforts he must now forgo His family that oft till eight hath lain Wi out his labours wage coud not do so &amp; glad to make them blest he shoffles thro the snow The early winters morns as dark as pitch The warey wife keeps tinder every night Wi flint &amp; steal &amp; many a sturdy twitch Sits up in bed to strike her man a light &amp; as the candle shows the rapturous sight Aside his wife his rosey sleeping boy He smacks his lips wi exquisite delight Wi all a fathers feelings fathers joy Then bids his wife good bye &amp; hies to his employ His br[e]akfast water porridge humble food A barley crust he in his wallet flings Wi this he toils &amp; labours i' the wood &amp; chops his faggot twists his band &amp; sings As happily as princes &amp; as kings Wi all their luxury—&amp; blest is he Can but the little which his labour brings Make both ends meet &amp; from long debts keep free &amp; keep as neat &amp; clean his creasing family Far oer the dreary fields the woodland lies Rough is the journey which he daily goes The wooley clouds that hang the frowning skies Keep winnowing down their drifting sleet &amp; snows &amp; thro his doublet keen the north wind blows While hard as iron the cemented ground &amp; smooth as glass the glibbed pool is froze His nailed boots wi clenching tread rebound &amp; dithering echo starts &amp; mocks the clamping sound The woods how gloomy in a winters morn The crows &amp; ravens even cease to croak The little birds sit chittering on the thorn The pies scarce chatter when the[y] leave the oak Startld from slumber by the woodmans stroke The milk maids songs is drownd in gloomy care &amp; while the village chimleys curl their smoke She milks &amp; blows &amp; hastens to be there &amp; nature all seems sad &amp; dying in despair The squirking rabbit scarcly leaves her hole But rolls in torpid slumbers all the day The fox is loath to gin a long patrole &amp; scouts the woods content wi meaner prey The hare so frisking timid once &amp; gay Hind the dead thistle hurkles from the view No[r] scarcly scard tho in the travellers way Tho waffling curs &amp; shepherd dogs pursue So winters riggid power affects all nature through What different changes winters frowns supplies The clown no more a loitering hour beguiles Nor gauping tracks the clouds along the skyes As when buds blossom &amp; the warm sun smiles When la[w]rence wages bids on hills &amp; stiles Banks stiles &amp; flowers &amp; skyes no longer charm Deep snow &amp; ice each summer seat defiles Wi hasty blundering step &amp; folded arm He glad the stable seeks his frost nipt nose to warm The shepherd seeks no more his spreading oak Nor on the sloping pond head lyes at lare The arbour he once wattld up is broke &amp; left unworthy of his future care The ragged plundering stickers have bin there &amp; bottld it away—he passes bye His summer dwelling desolate &amp; bare &amp; neer so much as turns a 'serning eye But gladly seeks his fire &amp; leaves the 'clement skye The scenes all clothd in snow from morn till night The woodmans loath his chilly tools to sieze The crows unroosting as he comes in sight Shake down the feathery burthen from the trees To look at things around hes fit to freeze Scard from her pearch the fluttering pheasant flies His coat &amp; hat wi ryhme is turned white He quakes looks round &amp; pats his hands &amp; sighs &amp; wishes to him self that the warm sun woud rise &amp; be the winter cutting as it will Let north winds winnow fit to nip one through In the deep woods hard fate demands him still To stand the bitterest blasts that ever blew Where trees instead of leaves &amp; pearly dew In ryhme &amp; snow &amp; Iscicles abound The proverb ‘use is second natures’ true It must be so or how coud he be found To weather out the blast &amp; daily stand his ground &amp; yet tho fortune frowns upon the poor &amp; dooms their life to slavish hard employ Tho wealth forever gainst em shuts her door &amp; strives their fainting wishes to destroy Yet still poor souls they have a glimpse of joy A sugard charm still sweets the sours of fate His sparing bliss when met does never cloy While over much does paul the idly great As rich &amp; sumptious foods does surfeitings create Good luck it is his providential wealth That hardy labour &amp; the freshing air Shoud 'crease his strength &amp; keep entire his health &amp; neer let illness on his soul despair Wi wife &amp; childern pending on his care What woud he do a livlihood to gain The parish moneys but a pining fare Such scouts benevolence he does disdain Who grudges what they give &amp; mocks the poor mans pain But if unwell from toil hes forcd to stop He quickly then repairs to medcines aid Tho not to nauciates of the druggists shop Or cant advice of docters mystic trade But to such drugs as daily are displayd Een round his walks &amp; cottage door profuse ‘Self heal’ &amp; ‘agrimony’ which has made Full many an huswife wonderous cures produce These he in summer seeks &amp; hurds up for his use The robin tamest of the featherd race Soon as he hears the woodmans sounding chops Wi ruddy bosom &amp; a simple face Around his old companions feet he hops &amp; there for hours in pleasd attention stops The woodmans heart is tender &amp; humane &amp; at his meals he many a crumble drops Thanks to thy generous feelings gentle swain &amp; what thy pity gives shall not be gave in vain The woodman pleased views the closing day To see the sun drop down behind the wood Sinking in clouds deep blue or misty grey Round as a football &amp; as red as blood The pleasing prospect does his heart much good Tho tis not his such beautys to admire He hastes to fill his bags wi billet wood Well pleasd from the chill prospect to retire To seek his corner chair &amp; warm snug cottage fire &amp; soon the dusky even hovers round &amp; the white frost gins crizzle pond &amp; brook The little family are squinting round &amp; from the door dart many a wistful look The suppers ready stewing on the hook &amp; every foot that clampers down the street Is for the coming fathers step mistook &amp; joyd are they when he their eyes does meet Bent neath his load snow clad as whites a sheet I think I see him seated in his chair Taking the bellows up the fire to blow I think I hear him joke &amp; chatter there Telling his childern news they wish to know Wi leather leggings on that stopt the snow His broad brimd hat uncoothly shapen round Nor woud he Ill be bound woud it were so Gi two pence for the chance did it abound At that same hour to be the king of england crownd Soons suppers down the thrifty wife seeks out Her little jobs of family conserns Chiding her childern rabbling about Says they'll 'stroy more then what their father earns &amp; their torn clohs she bodges up &amp; darns For desent women cannot bear the sight Of dirty houses &amp; of ragged ba[i]rns Tis their employment &amp; their chief delight To keep their cots &amp; childern neat &amp; tight The woodman smokes the brats in mirth &amp; glee &amp; artless prattle evens hours beguile While loves last pledge runs scrambling up his knee The nightly comfort from his weary toil His chuff cheeks dimpling in a fondling smile He claims his kiss &amp; says his scraps of prayer Begging his daddys pretty song the while Playing wis jacket buttons &amp; his hair &amp; thus in wed locks joys the labourer drowns his care Nor can one miss the bliss from labour freed Which poor men meeteth on a Sunday morn Fixt in a chair some godly book to read Or wandering round to view the crops &amp; corn In best cloaths fitted out &amp; beard new shorn Dropping adown in some warm shelterd dell Wi six days labour weak &amp; weary worn Listning around each distant chiming bell That on the softening air melodiously doth swell His pipe pufft out he edges in his chair &amp; stirs the embers up his hands to warm &amp; with his singing book he does repair To humming oer an anthem hymn or psalm Nor does he think a ballad any harm But often carrols oer his cottage hearth ‘Bold robin hood’ the ‘Shipwreck’ or the ‘storm’ O where we find this social joy &amp; mirth There we may truly say a heaven exists on earth The clock when eight warns all for bed prepare The childern still an extra minute crave &amp; sawn &amp; stammer longer oer their prayers &amp; they such tempting fond excuses have The 'dulging father oft the boon has gave &amp; sung again the younkers to delight While every hard earnd farden glad to save The carfull wife puts out the candle light &amp; oer the fire the song &amp; tale makes sweet the winters night &amp; as most lab'rers knowingly pretend By certain signs to judge the weather right As oft from ‘noahs ark’ great floods desend &amp; ‘burred moons’ fortell great storms at night In such like things the wood man took delight &amp; ere he went to bed woud always ken Wether the sky was gloomd or stars shone bright Then went to comforts arms till morn &amp; then As cheery as the sunrise beams resumd his toils agen &amp; ere he slept he always breathd a prayer ‘I thank thee lord what thou to day didst give ‘Sufficient strength to toil I bless thy care ‘&amp; thank thee still for what I may recieve ‘&amp; o almighty god while I still live ‘My eyes if opend on the last days sun ‘Prepare thou me this wicked world to leave ‘&amp; fit my passage ere my race is run ‘Tis all I beg o lord thy heavenly will be done’ Holland to thee this humble ballads sent Thee who for poor mans well fare oft hath prayd Whose tongue did neer belye its good intent Preacher as well in practice as in trade Alas too often moneys business made O may the wretch thats still in darkness living The bibles comforts hear by thee displayd And many a woodmans family forgiven Have cause for blessing thee that led their way for heaven IMPROMTU [Where art thou wandering little child] Where art thou wandering little child I said to one I met to day She pusht her bonnet up &amp;

every thing shines round me just as then Mole hills &amp; trees &amp; bushes speckling wild That freshens all those pastimes up agen O griveous day that changd me from a child To seek the play thing &amp; the pleasing toy The painted pootey shell &amp; summer flowers How blest was I when I was here a boy What joys were mine in these delightfull hours On this same bank I bound my poseys up &amp; culld the sweetest blossoms one by one The cowslips still entices me to stoop But all the feelings they inspird are gone Tho in the midst of each endeard delight Where still the cowslaps to the breezes bow Tho all my childish scenes are in my sight Sad manhood marks me an intruder now Here runs the brook which I have damd &amp; stopt Wi choaking sods &amp; water weeds &amp; stones &amp; watchd wi joy till bursting off it plopt In rushing gushes of wild murmering groans Here stands the tree wi clasping ivy bound Which oft Ive clumb to see the chaps at plough &amp;

calls my structures castles in the air Now een the thistles quaking in the wind The very rushes nodding oer the green Hold each expressive language to my mind That like old mayteys tell of what has been O ‘sweet of sweets’ from infancy that flow When can we witness bliss so sweet as then Might I but have my choice of joy below I'd only ask to be a boy agen Life owns no joy so pleasant as the past That banishd pleasure rapt in memorys womb It leaves a flavour sweet to every taste Like the sweet substance of the honey comb MY MATEY A tinker on his stoney seat Mending kettles in the street This funny ballad did repeat About his matey Who stead of going to church to pray To ale house slives the nearest way &amp;

woud nourish the tree Thy beauty is gone ah thy rose bud is witherd New love cannot warm to look kindly on thee The world may comend thee as not to knock under I wish thou maynt prove what I look on wi pain But I doubt thou wilt find when were countys asunder The world more decietful then him you disdain When black gloomy night comes we look for a morning The skys clear of clouds &amp; suns shine after rain But alas a long leaving without a returning Stifle thy scorn &amp; bethink ont again Wornt near a tear witness repentance inclines thee I go but o god who my anguish can tell I go were my fate &amp;

bids it be gone Thus one generation keeps passing away &amp; new generations their places retain &amp; the friends of our bosom that leave us to day Shall neer fill the circle of friendship again They go &amp; their lives as if never begun In the sleep of the grave shall be heard of no more In future transactions done under the sun No portion is left them to act as before Their exit they make to that awful unknown &amp;

faintly drifts his threatnings still In snowy sleet &amp; blackning skyes Yet were the willow leaning lyes &amp; shields beneath the budding flower Were banks to break the wind arise Tis sweet to sit &amp; spend an hour Tho floods of winter bustling fall Adown the arches bleak &amp; blea Tho snow storms cloath the mossy wall &amp; hourly whiten oer the lea Yet when from clouds the sun is free &amp; warms the learning bird to sing Neath sloping bank or sheltering tree Tis sweet to watch the creeping spring Tho still so early one may spy &amp; track her footsteps every hour The daisey with its golden eye &amp; primrose bursting into flower &amp; snugly were the thorney bower Keeps off the nipping frost &amp; wind Excluding all but sun &amp; shower Their early vi'lets childern find Here neath the shelving banks retreat The horse blob swells its golden ball Nor fears the ‘lady smocks’ to meet The snows that round the blossoms fall Here by the arches ancient wall The antique eldern buds anew Again the bull rush sprouting tall The water wrinkles rippling thro As springs wan herrald april comes As natures sleep is nearly past How sweet to hear the wakening hums Of aught beside the winter blast Of featherd minstrels first &amp; last The robins songs again begun &amp; clearing the skyes long over cast Larks rise to hail the peeping sun The stirt'ling pewets as they pass Scream joyous wizzing over head Right glad the fields &amp; meadow grass Will quickly hide their carless shed The rooks were yonder witchens spread Quawk clamourous to the springs approach Here silent from its watery bed To hail its coming leaps the roach While stalking oer the fields again In stript defiance to the storms The hardy seedsmen spread the grain &amp; all their hopfull toil performs In flocks the timid pigeon swarms For scatterd curnells chance may spare &amp; as the plough unbeds the worms The crows &amp; magpyes gather there Yon bullocks low their liberty The young grass cropping to their fill &amp; colts from strawyards neighing free Springs opening promise joys at will Along the bank beside the rill The happy lambkins bleat &amp; run Then weary neath a sheltering hill Drop basking in the gleaming sun At distance from the waters edge On hanging thorn boughs farthest stretch The more hen 'gins her nest of sedge Safe from destroying boys to reach Fen sparrows chirp &amp; flye to fetch The witherd reed down rustling nigh &amp; by the sunny side the ditch Prepare their dwelling warm &amp; dry Again a storm encroaches round Thick clouds are dark'ning deep behind &amp; thro the arches hoarsley sound The risings of the hollow wind Springs early hopes seem half resignd &amp; silent for awhile remain Till sun beams broken clouds can find &amp; brighten all to life again Ere yet a hail stone pattering comes Or dimps the pool the rainy squall One hears the mighty murmuring hums The spirit of the tempest call Here sheltering neath this ancient wall I still pursue my musing dreams &amp; as the hail stones round me fall I mark their bubbles in the streams Reflection here is warmd to sigh Tradition gives these brigs renown Tho heedless time long passd em by Nor thought em worthy noting down Here in the mouth of every clown The roman road familiar sounds All else with everlasting frown Oblivions mantling mist surounds These walls the work of roman hands How may conjecturing fancys pore As lonley here one calmly stands On path that age has trampld oer The builders names are known no more No spot on earth their memory wears &amp; crowds reflecting thus before Have since found graves as dark as theirs The storm has ceas'd again the sun The ague shivering season drys Short winded march thoult soon be done Thy fainting tempest milder dyes Soon aprils flowers &amp;

dream entranced oer each form divine Worth wild enthusiast shall be cherish'd here &amp; thine with him shall linger &amp; be dear ON ? Follys a fool that cannot keep her ground Still fearing foes &amp; showing where to wound A jealous look can almost turn her sick &amp; hints not meant oft gauls her to the quick &amp; hide or shuffle or do what she will Each mask like glass reflects the picture still As powder kindles from the smallest spark Confusion buzes &amp;

force from eyes a mockery of tears Few glowing fancys in the theme appears The trials love &amp; nature undergo Two tender lovers born to clouded years Hopes nipt in storms that checker life below Makes up this simple tale of unpretending woe No burning pictures paints imagined strife Fancys deep plots &amp; terrors here are few This common picture on the map of life Who ever cons that motly page may view &amp; find such storys but alas too true Tho high raisd souls may scorn so mean a lay Who from romances all their pity drew Yet are there tender maids as fair as they Shall read such tales in tears &amp;

life with thee as thy companions came Helen was lovly like a picture such That poets paint, a dream of beautys light Her cheek glowed with the rose buds gentlest touch &amp; on her neck the lily revelled white &amp; on her bosom never made for care The blue veins flowed in luxurys delight In lucious ringlets danced her shaded hair Her bright eye sparkeld blue—O she was more then fair Her eyes were soft to look on &amp; her hair Was darkly brown which curled in idle play Down her white forhead—her soft cheek was fair Feint flushed like eves which fond night steals away On her white neck the enarmourd ringlets lay Nestling like clouds in bright calm summer skyes Her lips wore smiles woud lead a saint astray &amp; her young bosom just begun to rise A witching seat for love &amp; throbbd its extacys Her soul was virtues in its purest claim Her heart was spotless as the turtle dove Earths sins were strangers only known by name Her speaking eyes beamed innocence &amp; love If earth owned one ere worthy heaven above Twas she the saint the angel unbeguiled That led a life which no one need reprove She only loved &amp; that was undefiled Tho fate disdained that love &amp; mocked her while it smiled Edmund a gentle youth of manners mild Met Helens beauty in its fondest hour That opened on his anxious gaze &amp; smiled With all sweet womans fascinating power For witching beauty was her earliest dower It slept in childhood like a bud disguised A lovley bud far lovlier when in flower He wood her early &amp; his suit was prized By her whose only crime was loving unadvised &amp; long he loved her ere he dared to name His hearts fond anguish to the lovly maid Mistrusting fear &amp; self confusing shame That oer loves hopes will ever cast a shade Still sealed his tongue &amp; kept his heart afraid Oft love burnt urgent to reveal its pain &amp; doubts as oft its courage woud up braid Telling in sighs such trials woud be vain &amp; thus his love woud burn &amp; thus woud damp again The balmy breathings of the voice that breaks In heavenly music on our ravished ears Singing the utterers beauty while she speaks The flowing hair the bright eye rich with tears The soft cheek flushd with hope or pale with fears The swelling breast who coud its heart betray The love the sigh that tenderly endears Women possesd these charms in early day &amp; they posses them on to while our hearts away Oft as for walks of pleasure she woud rove On summer days when roads were clean &amp; dry Venturing from out her fathers beachen grove Across the fields the youth with anxious eye Oft saw &amp; passed on purpose closely bye She deemd it rudness first but soon excused That rudness worthy of a tenderer name &amp; learned as passing to return the sigh Her hearts fond warmth was checked by maiden shame Which he mistook for pride &amp; deemd her heart to blame But hopes did gather freedom &amp; in stealth Love ventured looks &amp; smiles &amp; oft woud say The day was fine &amp; compliment her health &amp; urge some trifling kindness in her way As offering help when ere her journey lay Oer brooks or stiles—then begd to be excused For unmeant rudeness as she blushd away Thus Edmunds hopes such trifles oft amused When each heart feign had spoke what eithers tongue refused The very flowers so fancys power beguiles That in her garden met his passing view As the suns looks add beauty were it smiles Seemd from her charms to steal a sweeter hue &amp; looked to him the lovliest flowers that grew A[h] were was rose &amp; lily half so fair To Edmunds eyes as those which Helen knew None seemed like those that blossomd neath her care Such ways hath partial love to wed the heart to care Oft buoyant hope urged him his suit to move &amp; with its whispers he at length complied —Fond Helen blushed &amp; every way was love Her eyes in looks of tenderness replyed &amp; told in silence he was not denied But doubts &amp; fears like brambles had their hold On her too tender bosom—flattered pride She knew woud deem the youths affections bold &amp; oft she told her doubts &amp; wept at what she told He urged his passion tenderly &amp; true &amp; tho consent returned him no reply Affection warmed her cheek with deeper hue &amp; the soft languish of her beaming eye That stole their tender color from the sky Serenly blue—looked on him with a smile &amp; her soft bosom struggling with its sigh Told his fond hopes a story void of guile While courage seized her hand &amp; paid its vows the while Is aught of earthly raptures half so sweet As that which thrills the soul in youths fond fear When met the object which it doats to meet &amp; loves first hope is whisperd in her ear &amp; finds that hope approved—is aught so dear As the first yielding smile by love subdued Lifes hope may wander many an after year From the first idol that its heart pursued But never shall it meet that happiness renewed O how he felt when first her lips he prest &amp; met the warmth returned—when lily white Thro the thin covering lawn her heaving breast First spread loves beautious heaven on his sight &amp; fixed his eyes in trances of delight When first he languishd on that seat of rest While beaming oer him like an holy light Her eyes shed smiles of welcome on their guest &amp; told her souls confession—it was blest Ah what a pleasure doth that bosom prove That links its heart with hopes eternity To some fair maidens purity of love Whose thoughts whose hopes whose raptures all agree Whose warm souls mingle one—how mild &amp; free Thro' hermit life their happiness sojourns As dear as heaven if aught so dear can be Is that fond heart who at loves alter burns &amp; meets from womans smile affections warm returns What heart but gladdens when a woman smiles What darksome cares but sickens in that light When womans soothing tenderness beguiles &amp; like a moonbeam in the clouded night Cheers up heart sickening sorrows to delight Where is the friend that cherishes &amp; cheers Like womans smiles theres somthing in the sight As heaven were nigh—theres pleasure in her tears When pitys tale she hears &amp; weeps at what she hears Their love was ardent but it seemed as vain When ere they pondered oer the gulph between Their births &amp; fortunes—ah coud Helen gain Those oft repeated wishes to have been A cottage maiden on some village green Keeping her sheep with Edmund day by day ‘Ah’ she woud say ‘what pleasure I had seen’ &amp; wept when Edmund bid her hopes be gay Smiled on her doubts &amp; kissed their bitterness away They loved in secret when a chance was given To blind suspicion &amp; to be alone Then did they steal to pay their vows to heaven That rose like offered inscence round the throne &amp; made their wishes unto heaven known Who unlike cruel man coud not despise &amp; in such hopes he called the maid his own &amp; lookd those silent answers from her eyes That tenderly returned unspeakable replys They met on sundays when the fields were still &amp; peace was found in many secret nooks &amp; there they sought the moles long finished hill Mossed oer—&amp; feasted on each others looks &amp; she'd repeat sweet passages from books Were love was told the sweetest—often they Woud trace the secret journeyings of brooks Far from all paths were jealous eyes might stray Oer heaths &amp; pastures wild their heaven directed way They met at eve when solitude beguiled Their steps with secresy &amp; made them blest When the pale moon beam on their pleasures smiled &amp; calmly slept on Helens heaving breast As if it loved so beautiful a rest They walked &amp; told their hopes of other years That never was to come but hopes possest Ideal pleasures not unchecked with fears That oft made Helen sigh &amp; turn away in tears &amp; oft they warmed to raptures fond extreams That soothed all care to lethargy—no thought But pleasures mixed in such delicious dreams Such evenings came as they from heaven were brought To bid life vanish &amp; the world be nought But for such partings—ah that love shoud part Care in that portion mixed her bitterest draught For each to drink—mad absence urged the smart &amp; bade the short farewell in heaviness of heart Art thou in love or hast thou ever loved Then canst thou feel it or has felt it all The thrilling joys with which the soul is moved The trifling fears that keeps the heart in thrall Ah thou hast sipt its honey &amp; its gall For both unseverd in its draughts remain The restless memory that will back recall Loves absent idol &amp; the pleasing pain That dwells upon the heart till both shall meet again Sweet is the even after showers have fell On days hot beating bosom some few hours Before the sunset when refreshed with smell The sweet briar perks its leaves &amp; woodbine flowers Doth hearten up fresh fragrance in the dell Who that loves nature doth not love to dwell An hour by dripping woods while the fresh air Breaths added sweets—fair Helen loved it well &amp; oft with Edmund met such hours to share The fairest blossom that was blooming there &amp; markd each rural scene—the lowing herds Wind one by one adown the homward lane &amp; listnd the soft song of twitting birds &amp; shepherds ditty striding home again Each rural pleasure did their steps detain With many a minutes gaze—&amp; she woud sigh With doubtful happiness whose joys are pain While the flushd milkmaid tript in raptures bye To think that fortunes pride had placd her life so high &amp; he woud seek her blossoms by her side &amp; place them in her breast to fade away While she woud prize them with affections pride Nor deem them worthless in their quick decay But kept them withering many an after day As fond remembrances of loves esteem &amp; oft in blushing smiles she woud betray Such secret fondness in her loves extream Which thrilled thro Edmunds soul like beauty in a dream He looked thrilled raptures from her smiling eye &amp; watched her fond heart in its soft retreat Till thrilling extacy raised hopes so high As een to fancy he coud hear it beat With loves fond flutterings of delightful heat &amp; in such swooning joys he fondly prest Her willing lips to his the touch how sweet &amp; on her bosom he woud linger blest Ah who on earth that loves coud wish a sweeter rest When poisond slander sleeps itself to nought &amp; no eye waketh save the silver moon How balmy night doth sooth loves restless thought Burnt with anxietys befeverd noon How beautiful how pleasant is the boon With eves soft curtain round their whispers thrown How love doth chide the hour that flyes too soon &amp; leaves them with the busy day alone With absent cares &amp; pains to lovers only known Love like the spring when warm suns bids it blossom Oft dreams oer joys as they woud neer decay Smiling like flowers that bares to heaven her bosom As tho no season hastend on its way To blight their blooms &amp; take the place of may Ah love is often like the budding spring Blest in the sunny raptures of to day Wrapt in lifes pleasures like a lasting thing Unmindful of the clouds that dark to morrows bring Time unpercieved from happiness doth creep Eve like a watch man may give place to night &amp; quick eyed morning start dull night from sleep Eer love left dallying in supreem delight Woud scarcly dream an hour had taken flight —What pains to love the hour to parting brings When the last gleams of mellancholy light A farewell shadow oer their pleasure flings &amp; spreads loves modest joys on night falls jealous wings Eve oft wore wearied to its stillest hour &amp; woud have dreamed itself to glad repose But the fond lovers lingerd in their bower &amp; with that joy the lover only knows Forbid in urged delays its eyes to close Silence seemed waiting sickend with delay &amp; eves pale star in jealous splendour rose Night as in hurry spread its doubtful grey &amp; like a thief stole in to urge their joys away From such delays suspicions ambushd eyes For ever watching like a beast of prey Lookd thro the causes of loves thin disguise &amp; all its hopes did smother &amp; waylay Her friends enquired the cause of such delay &amp; questiond Helen who in terror sighd &amp; neath their frowns wept many hours away Ere she the secret to disclose complied &amp; when loves prayer was utterd scorn denyed Hard is that heart that feels not o how hard To witness womans tears sure such are few That pays imploring pity no regard From things so lovly &amp; so tender too As woman earths endearing angel—who That owns the name of man coud ever wear Hells fiendish mask to mock &amp; to pursue Sweet womans wrongs &amp; drive her to despair O god they must be fiends tis more then man coud bear &amp; what is wealth that it shoud thus be prized Above the value of far better things That wanting it shoud leave all worth despised &amp; blight the joy that from affection springs With heavens own pleasures that its mercy brings To make the world less irksome—what is gold Fond hearts to sever that the closest cling[s] Whose fond affection round the heart hath hold Is love a bargain to be bought or sold Edmund was poor tho he that worth coud claim That thousands cannot who pretend to love An uncorrupted heart an honest name &amp; worth thats welcomd by the pure above While these were all that Helen wished to prove But worth in vain with other hearts did sue Her fathers heart all merit failed to move By fortune blest hed higher aims in view Which Helen deemd a curse &amp; prophesied too true Edmund the poor was not the vulgar hind His friends in fortunes favours met decay Yet loss of wealth left better worth behind Minds well informd that cannot pass away For fortune is a dream of yesterday &amp; for tomorrow oft provides but ill Beggering in earnest while it seems in play Wealth is not left to reasons equal skill But thrown to blindfold chance to scatter were she will They bade her pride such humble views disdain They urged at riches with oerruling power They bade her heart forget him—ah how vain As well might nature in the summers hour Forbid the hopeful bud to be a flower She heard in grief &amp; stifled many a sigh &amp; while their frowns oer every hope did lower It bound her love with closer tenderer ties As the weak woodbine clings when hopless storms are high Ah what is hope in desolate distress Can it have power to smile &amp; linger there Can it have power to make our sorrows less Or sooth the viper fang of poisoning care When madness gauls those sorrows to despair Ah what is hope in sorrows saddest hour A falling meteor that once seemd a star A flattering shower on autumns sickly bower A dewdrop glistning on a withered flower The fond bird leaves its nest &amp; pines forlorn When its loved mate becomes the fowlers prey Een the fair blossom from its partner torn By maiden choice or childhoods wanton play Mourns the foul deed &amp; withereth away So Helens bloom—of flowers the lovliest one That suns ere rose to cherish did decay Torn from the hope its beauty doated on That beauty sickend when that hope was gone Lifes ills woud claim a book of jiant size To page their terrors—but a slender share The pigmy portion which its joy supplys A page woud note it &amp; have room to spare Soon soon that page is blotted oer with care &amp; seared with dissapointments blighting eye Weak are its hopes such struggling storms to bear Life at the best but scantling blooms supply &amp; pirate storms throng round to bid that little dye Parting is heavy grief tho hopes may lean Towards better days too often hoped in vain Yet frowning abscence claims the space between As withering winters take their yearly reign Tween summers past &amp; summers hoped again But when sad absence hopless frowns impart &amp; cloud loves spring with winters that remain O weres the thought can feel for that sad heart Were is a word can tell how sad it is to part They deemed past love an unforgiving crime &amp; all its sorrows malice did deride Her walks forbidding in the summer time &amp; eves hours watching with a jealous pride Soft pity pleaded but to be denied Edmund was scorned as one of low degree In vain her soul oer its affections sighed Love was a captive never to be free &amp; doubted joys before left earnest misery Memorys a pleasure that all life doth share The weary bird will reccollect its nest The timid terrors of the startled hare Urges its flight to what it once possest &amp; seeks the lone haunts of its former rest The slaving horse oft on his weary way Looks for the hour when freedom was his guest The swallow shuns dull autumns dreary day &amp; flyes on memorys wings to summers far away Memory for Helen oft did garlands weave Of all the hopless hopes that once had been But they were blooms like those which summers leave Seared with the Autumns melancholly scene Sickening &amp; withering &amp; no longer green That pictured painful ecchoes unto pain Blighted with cares &amp; near a hope to screen Ah they were blossoms that had bloomed in vain &amp; scarfed in mourning now as near to bloom again Life spread to both a desert cold &amp; chill Hope withered to the core without one smile Not one green nook turn were so ere they will Were peace might shun fates blasting frowns the while &amp; one lorn minute of its pain beguile As storms meet storms against &amp; with the wind Fate darkend every were oer loves exile Days came &amp; left them unto night resigned With hopless glooms before &amp; blighted hopes behind The fairest beauty is assailed by time The brightest eye is sullied oft in tears The gentlest heart that rarely knows a crime Gainst rudest sorrow often preseveres The sweetest hope is not without its fears Grief oft encroaches an unbidden guest In choicest pleasures which this life endears Care lurks in peace's paths to break its rest &amp; curses like to storms frown round to blight the blest She faded like a flower yet loath to shun Her presence beauty fondly lingered still Tho from her cheeks grief had the rosey won &amp; planted its pale shadows winter chill Yet like the lilys they were lovly still As lingering blossoms meet the winter wind Smiling at death tho pierced with every ill So Helen drooped &amp; bowed to friends unkind &amp; smiled in tears to trouble half resignd Oft she woud watch the eves star into heaven &amp; from her window muse with wistful eye &amp; thought ere Edmund from her love was driven How oft it blessed them neath its 'lumind sky &amp; she woud think oer pleasures past &amp; sigh &amp; wept till it became a joy to weep &amp; oft weak hope woud struggle up &amp; flye To better days that fate yet hushed asleep &amp; in such extacys care woud its sabbath keep ‘Ah’ she would sigh ‘eve sinks in nights dull arms ‘But morning from his frowns shall glad retreat ‘As from a tyrants love with blushing charms ‘The fondling smiles of the young sun to meet ‘To its fond love the skylark carrols sweet ‘Both to the evening &amp; the morning grey— ‘O when will love to me its smiles repeat ‘Were shall I meet it on my weary way ‘A night surrounds me now &amp; when will it be day ‘Can the free will to love with nature given ‘Be deemed a lawless &amp;

hope &amp; smile &amp; doubt &amp; weep again Wild feverd fancys lulld her throbbing breast Only to add fresh fuel unto pain Ah who coud see such beauty grieve in vain What heart so hard coud mock at its decay Yet still they mockd her with pursued disdain &amp; turned deaf ears to all love had to say &amp; pride in teazing scorn woud smile its taunts away &amp; Edmund viewd the past with hopless eye As happy days that never woud return No hope with him coud the past loss supply But the last hope were endless joys sojourn With sickening griefs his heart did daily burn As blest no more with Helens cheering smile Lost to her presence he did vainly mourn &amp; wrote his last farwell &amp; wept the while Yet cheered his words with smiles her sorrows to beguile ‘O grieve not Helen make thy truce with joy ‘Thou wert not born for grief—a thing so fair ‘Consuming sorrow woud full soon destroy ‘Can the low violet from its wooded lare ‘Peer in the tempest with its bosom bare ‘Can the pale primrose so reserved &amp;

be at rest’ Thus hopless Edmund wrote his last farwell Not with lost joys hopes fancys to deride Tho he on comforts did despairing dwell He talked of hopes their hoplessness to hide &amp; the mad anguish of his heart belied To cheer fond Helens in its trying pain He sought no comfort tho the world was wide &amp; looked on life as one that lived in vain &amp; mused oer pleasures past as neer to bloom again O there are cares at which resistance laughs Were cold encouragments are idle pleas Were jiant resolutions shrink to dwarfs With strengths as feeble as the summer breeze &amp; mocks the anguish which they cannot ease Een rosey hope will turn its smiles away &amp; wither pale in tempests such as these Cant may its moral promptitude display But cares will shadow still with little hopes of day ‘O what is love’ he sighed ‘but shadowed dreams ‘That fancy like to sleep createth fair ‘Visioned realitys that beauty seems ‘&amp;

with unwearied eye mark pleasing things To see the gadding swallow gaily pass Crumping the quiet lake with dipping wings &amp; list the restless cuckoo while it sings In distant trees—&amp; nigh hand in the wood That skirts its shadow oer my mossy seat I love that pleasant russling noise to meet That tells of happiness with more then me Of fluttering linnets this years summer brood That 'scaped the schoolboys eye &amp; fly to greet Their happy parent hasting home with food As I do love such pleasing things to see &amp; in ones thoughts such pleasures to repeat BALLAD [Young Chloe looks sweet as the rose] Young Chloe looks sweet as the rose &amp; her love might be reckond no less But her bosom so freely bestows That all may a portion posess Her smiles woud be cheering to see But so freely theyre lavishd abroad That each silly swain well as me Can boast of the smiles she bestowd Her smiles and her kisses so free Blesses all like the rain from the sky As the blossoms love is to the bee Each swain is as welcome as I And tho I my folly can see Yet still must I love and adore Tho I know the love wisperd to me Is a lye told to many before Tis sad that a bosom so fair And red lips so seemingly sweet Shoud study false ways to ensnare And breath in their kisses deceit But beautys no guide to the best The rose that out blushes the morn While it tempts the glad eye to its breast Will pierce the fond hand with a thorn Yet still must I love silly swain And put up with all her deciet And try to be jealous in vain For I cannot help thinking her sweet When I see other swains in her bower I sigh and excuse what I see And say to my self ‘is the flower ‘Any worse when its kissd by the bee’. A SONG In Fashionable Style O throw aside those carless ways My conscous heart to move Affected anger but betrays Suspicous doubts of love That face were frowns at will can dwell Were cold deciet beguiles May just as easy &amp; as well Dissemble while it smiles Tis cruel when false smiles betrays The heart into a snare But crueler when slighting ways Turns pleasures to despair Thy face is fair let that suffice &amp; scorn a meaner power Truth adds to beautys fading price As fragrance to the flower Yet tho you frown or smile in jest My folly must declare A weakness burning in my breast Feels all in earnest there [Sweet blossoms of lifes happy spring] Sweet blossoms of lifes happy spring &amp; childhoods sunny day How blest had life no change to bring To mar your joyous play With you the past hath nought of pain The future nothing seems But play &amp; sleep &amp; play again A change of happy dreams Sweet blossoms may my hopes be true &amp; more then visions be That pictures better luck to you Then ere befell to me Lifes fears &amp; heart destroying cares Mildews of heedless hours The gilded baits in follys snares Like cankers eating flowers False friends false loves that thickly starts Like thistles all around In the worlds way were truest hearts Receve the deepest wound My timid cautious wary feet Be near that dangerous step To hesitate with counsel sweet To look before ye leap My blossoms when with reasons thought Ye read this truth too true Let my experience dearly bought Be cheap advice to you Then will ye miss what I have won Cares that all life destroys &amp; meet what folly bade me shun Lifes best of shameless joys SPRING The eldern opens by the cottage eves In which the redcap yearly builds her nest &amp; goosberry bushes shoot their hairy leaves Were the pert Robbin with its ruddy breast Sits watching worms the gardeners spade unbears The sallow trees in golden palms are drest &amp; the black thorn its early livery wears In snowy blossoms hing that catch the eye Like pleasant fancys rising unawares —Shining at distance like cloaths hung to drye On naked hedges one scarce thinks of flowers The daisy ventures to unclose its eye Where new dropt lambs lie basking in the sun &amp; all things warn us of the spring begun WINTER The morning wakens with the lumping frails Chilly &amp; cold—the early rising clown Hurkles along &amp; blows his finger nails Iceicles from the cottage eves hang down Which passing childern wish for in their play —The fields once clad in autumns russet brown Spreads like the eye its circle far away In one hugh sheet of snow—from the white wood The crows all silent seek the dreary fens &amp; starnels blacken through the air in crowds The sheep stand bleating in their turnip pens &amp; loath their frozen food—while labouring men Button their coats more close from angry clouds &amp; wish for night &amp; its snug fire agen THE FODDERING BOY The foddering boy along the crumping snows With straw band belted legs &amp; folded arm Hastens &amp; on the blast that keenly blows Oft turns for breath &amp; beats his fingers warm &amp; shakes the lodging snows from off his cloaths Buttoning his doublet closer from the storm &amp; slouching his brown beaver oer his nose Then faces it agen—&amp; seeks the stack Within its circling fence—were hungry lows Expecting cattle making many a track About the snows—impatient for the sound When in hugh fork fulls trailing at his back He litters the sweet hay about the ground &amp; brawls to call the staring cattle round SCHOOL BOYS IN WINTER The school boys still their morning rambles take To neighbouring village school with playing speed Loitering with pastimes leisure till they quake Oft looking up the wild geese droves to heed Watching the letters which their journeys make Or plucking awes on which the field fares feed &amp; hips &amp; sloes—&amp; on each shallow lake Making glib slides were they like shadows go Till some fresh pastimes in their minds awake &amp; off they start anew &amp; hasty blow Their numbd &amp; clumpsing fingures till they glow Then races with their shadows wildly run That stride hugh jiants oer the shining snow In the pale splendour of the winter sun AUTUMN SHOWERS The roads are thronged with mire from hasty showers &amp; every hollow hath its plashy lake Were school boys dabble in their leisure hours Their boats to swim or water mills to make With wild disorderd clouds the wilder skyes Are covered were the brewing blacking storm Is hourly rising while the shepherd boy Leaps oer the mole hill tops to keep him warm &amp; slou[c]hes his rusty hat &amp; belts his coat To face the expected tempest ere he flies To his sedge covered hut not far remote Or the known shelter of some hollow trees Were the lone Owlet startled from its dreams Flops oer his head in terrifying screams AUTUMN LANDSCAPE The woods tanned greeness beautifully turns To russets reds &amp; yellows were the eye Revels in wild delight &amp; loathly turns To were the fields &amp; meadows lonely lye Bleached to one brown &amp; mellancholly stain Were larks together flock &amp; lowly flye Among the stubbs for summer littered grain All silent save of noises that complain Of fears while the pined hawk darts whizzing bye Odd cows &amp; horses brouze about the lanes Were banks &amp; dykes undainty meals supply While the boy pauses by the meadow lakes To hear the crane repeat its lonly cry Pleased with the floods the frequent tempest makes AUTUMN Summer is gone &amp; all the merry noise Of busy harvest in its labouring glee The shouts of toil the laughs of gleaning boys Sweeing at dinner hours on willow tree The cracking whip the scraps of homely song Sung by the boys that drive the loaded wain The noise of geese that haste &amp; hiss along For corn that litters in the narrow lane Torn from the waggon by the hedge row trees Tinkles of wetting scythes amid the grain The bark of dogs stretched at their panting ease Watching the stouk were mornings dinner lay All these have past &amp; silence at her ease Dreams autumns mellancholly life away [As I wanderd oer the irish hills] As I wanderd oer the irish hills To a farmers house I came The night being wet &amp; somthing late I enterd in the same Till I became a courter With a bonny girl I spied She asked me if I had a wife &amp;

He never broke a vow, Though twice the clock's reminded me That he's deceiv'd me now. Through some bad girl, I well know that, Poor Peggy's love's forgot:’ Thus sigh'd a lass, as down she sat On the appointed spot. The night was gathering dark and deep, But absent was the swain; The dews on many a flower did weep, But Peggy wept in vain: And every noise that meets her ear, And fancy of her eye, Hope instant wipes away the tear, And paints the shepherd nigh. ‘Ah, now he comes, my cheek glows hot, His dog barks to the sheep!’ Alas, her own dog lay forgot, Loud whimpering in his sleep. ‘He rustles down the wood-path park, The boughs hung o'er it stirr'd!’— Alas, her Rover's dreaming bark Awoke a startled bird. Again she look'd, and once again Hop'd she her love should see, A glimpse of moonlight checq'd the plain— ‘Ah, here he comes, 'tis he!’ The trees hung o'er the shady way, 'Twas but a shadow'd oak. The stock-dove wak'd the mimic lay, ‘Ah, there my Henry spoke!’ ‘Ah, this is he! I know his tread!’ Again her hope's a dream; Her wandering cows had left their shed, And jump'd across the stream. ‘Ah, then he spoke, 'twas Henry plain!’ She felt she knew not how; Alas, the clock but told again That he had broke his vow. When wearied out, her home she seeks, Where nought could please her view; The tear stole silent down her cheeks, Two rose-leaves in the dew: Her auburn hair with sweetest grace That down her temples spread, The night-breeze wip'd it from her face, And kiss'd her in his stead. TO ? [Thou lovely bud, with many weeds surrounded] Thou lovely bud, with many weeds surrounded, I once again address thee with a song; To cheer thee up 'gainst Envy's adder-tongue That deeply oft thy reputation wounded, And did thy tender blossom mickle wrong. But, look thou up!—'tis known in nature's law That serpents seek the honey-hoarding bee, Rosemary's sweets the loathsome toad will draw, So beauty curdles envy's look on thee. Fain would the peacock's tail the bow express Which paints the clouds so sweet in April's rain, And just the same, that imp of ugliness Mimics thy lovely blossom,—but in vain; And fain would poison what she can't possess. RURAL MORNING Soon as the twilight thro the distant mist In silver [h]emmings skirts the purple east Ere yet the sun unveils his smiles to view &amp; drys the mornings chilly robes of dew Young hodge the horse boy with a soodling gait Slow climbs the stile or opes the creaky gate With willow switch &amp; halter by his side Prepard for dobbin whom he means to ride The only tune he knows still whistling oer &amp; humming scraps his father sung before As ‘wantley dragon’ &amp; the ‘magic rose’ The whole of music which his village knows That wild remembrance in each little town From mouth to mouth thro ages handles down Onward he jolls nor can the minstrel throngs Entice him once to listen to their songs Nor marks he once a blossom on his way A sensless lump of animated clay With weather beaten hat of rusty brown Stranger to brinks &amp; often times a crown With slop frock suiting to the ploughmans taste Its greezy skirtings twisted round his waiste &amp; hardnd hiloes clenchd with nails around Clamping defiance oer the stoney ground The deadly foes of many a blossomd sprout That luckless happens in each mornings rout In hobbling speed he roams the pasture round Till hunted dobbin &amp; the rest are found Where some from frequent meddlings of his whip Well knows their foe &amp; often trys to slip While dobbin tam'd by age &amp; labour stands To meet all trouble from his brutish hands &amp; patient leads to gate or knowley brake The teazing burthen of his foe to take Who soon as mounted with his switching weals Puts Dobs best swiftness in his heavy heels The toltering bustle of a blundering trot Which whips &amp; cudgels neer increasd a jot Tho better speed was urged from the clown &amp; thus he snorts &amp; jossles to the town &amp; now when toil &amp; summers in its prime In every vill at mornings earliest time To early risers many a hodge is seen &amp; many a dob's heard clattering oer the green Now straying beams from days unclosing eye In copper colourd patches flush the sky &amp; from nights prison strugglingly encroach To bring the summons of warm days approach Till slowly mounting oer the ridge of clouds That yet half shows his face &amp; half enshrouds Th'unfetterd sun takes his unbounded reign &amp; wakes all life to noise &amp; toil again &amp; while his opening mellows oer the scenes Of wood &amp; field their many mingling greens Industrys bustling din once more devours The soothing peace of mornings early hours The grunt of hogs freed from their nightly dens &amp; constant cacklings of new laying hens &amp; ducks &amp; geese that clamorous joys repeat The splashing comforts of the pond to meet &amp; chirping sparrows dropping from the eaves For offal curnels that the poultry leaves Oft signal calls of danger chittering high At skulking cats &amp; dogs approaching nigh &amp; lowing steers that hollow echoes wake Around the yard their nightly fast to brake As from each barn the lumping flail rebounds In mingling consert with the rural sounds While oer the distant fields more fainter creep The murmuring bleetings of unfolding sheep &amp; ploughmens callings that more hoarse proceed Where tuff industry urges labours speed &amp; bellowing cows that wait with udders full The welcome haloo of the maids ‘cum mull’ &amp; rumbling waggons deafen now again Rousing the dust along the narrow lane &amp; cracking whips &amp; shepherds hooting crys From wood land echoes surgeing sharp replys Hodge in his waggon marks the wonderous tongue &amp; talks with echoe as he drives along Still cracks his whip bawls every horses name &amp; echo still as ready bawls the same The puzzling mysterey he woud vainly cheat &amp; fein woud utter what it cant repeat Till speedless trials proves the doubted elf As skilld in noise &amp; sounds as hodge himself &amp; quite convincd with the proofs it gives The boy drives on &amp; fancys eccho lives As some wood fiend that fright benighted men The troubling spirit of a robbers den &amp; now the blossom of the village view With airy hat of straw &amp; apron blue &amp; short sleevd gown that half to guess reveals By fine turnd arms what beauty it conceals Whose cheeks health flushes with as sweet a red As that which strip[e]s the woodbine oer her head Deeply she blushes on her morning pad To prove the fondness of some passing lad Who with a smile that thrills her soul to view Holds the gate open till she passes through While turning nodds beck thanks for kindness done &amp; looks—if looks coud speak proclaims her won With well scourd buckets on proceeds the maid &amp; drives her cows to milk beneath the shade Were scarce a sunbeam to molest her steals Sweet as the thyme that blossoms were she kneels &amp; there oft scares the cooing amorous dove With her own favourd melodys of love Snugly retird in yet dew laden bowers The sweetest specimen of rural flowers Proving red glowing in the morning wind The powers of health &amp; nature when combind Last on the road the cow boy carless swings Leading tamd cattle in their tending strings With shining tin to keep his dinner warm Swung at his back or tuckd beneath his arm Whose sun burnt skin &amp; cheeks chuffd out with fat Are dy'd as rusty as his napless hat &amp; others driving loose their herds at will Are now heard howping up the pasture hill Peeld sticks they bear of hazel or of ash The rib markd hides of restless cows to thrash In sloven garb appears each bawling boy As fit &amp; suiting to their rude employ Their shoes worn down by many blundering treads Oft shows the tennants needing safer sheds &amp; tatterd cloaths that scarcely screen the back Which pasture hedges daily put to rack The pithy bunch of unripe nuts to seek &amp; crabs sun-reddend with a tempting cheek &amp; daubd about as if besmeard with blood Staind with the berries of the brambly wood That stud the straggling briars as black as jet Which when their cattle lare they run to get Or smaller kinds as if beglossd with dew Shining dim powderd with a downy blue That on weak tendrils lowly creeping grow Where choakd in flags &amp; sedges wandering slow The brook purls simmering its declining tide Down the crookd boundings of the pasture side There they to hunt the luscious fruit delight &amp; dabbling keep within their charges sight Oft catching prickly struttles on their rout &amp; miller thumbs &amp; gudgeons driving out Hid side the archd brig under many a stone That from its wall rude passing clowns have thrown &amp; while in peace cows eat &amp; chew their cuds Moozing cool shelterd neath the skirting woods To double uses they the hours convert &amp; turn the toils of labour into sport Till morns long streaking shadows loose their tails &amp; cooling winds swoon into futtering gales &amp; searching sunbeams warm &amp; sultry creep Warming the teazing inscets from their sleep &amp; dreaded gadflyes with their drowsey hum On the burnt wings of mid-day zephers come Urging each lown to leave his sports in fear To stop the gadding cows from sturting bye Droning unwelcome tidings on his ear That the sweet peace of rural morns gone bye THE CROSS ROADS OR HAYMAKERS STORY Stopt by the storm that long in sullen black From the south west staind its encroaching track Haymakers hussling from the rain to hide Sought the grey willows by the pasture side &amp; there while big drops bow the grassy stems &amp; bleb the withering hay with pearly gems Dimple the brook &amp; patter in the leaves The song &amp; tale an hours restraint relieves &amp; while the old dames gossip at their ease &amp; pinch the snuff box empty by degrees The young ones join in loves delightfull themes Truths told by gipsys &amp; expounded dreams &amp; mutterd things kept secrets from the rest Of sweethearts names &amp; who they love the best &amp; dazzling ribbons they delight to show The last new favours of some weigling beau That with such treacherey trys their hearts to move &amp; like the highest bribes the maidens love The old dames jealous of their wisperd praise Throw in their hints of mans deluding ways &amp; one to give her counsels more effect &amp; by examples illustrate the fact Of innoscence oercome by flattering man Thrice tappd her box &amp; pinchd &amp; thus began ‘Now wenches listen &amp; let lovers lye ‘Yell hear a story ye may profit bye ‘Im your age threble wi some oddments to't ‘&amp;

neath the shade of ash or hazel drops To eat his bread &amp; rest him for awhile Fit strength recruiting for resuming toil Old nathan wanderd to the pasture side Were worn out dobbin tother morning dyd He knew him well &amp; many a weary morn With dobbins aid had scores of furrows drawn &amp; like old parted friends his tear was shed While noisey magpys chatterd oer his head That seemly scolded an unwelcome guest Whose feard intrusions stopt their mangling feast He bended oer the bones &amp; with a sigh Recounted thus the merits that was bye ‘Poor faithfull dob[b]in I regret to see ‘The last sad end of such a horse as thee ‘For every drop of thine was noble blood ‘Nor didst thou own a hair but what was good ‘In every ploughman thou a friend coudst win ‘One idle bone neer harbourd in thy skin ‘Thou never needed whipping no not thou ‘Words were enough when yokd to cart or plough ‘How ever cruel boys thy worth might see ‘Toils urging weapons neer was meant for thee ‘At cart &amp;

roads ‘No whips was needed to remove the loads ‘Not they indeed good words &amp; gentle ways ‘Were quite sufficient in thy younger days ‘&amp; tho good corn might others make as stout ‘A better horse was never harnessd out ‘Thy heart was willing &amp;

if long pulling showd the match too much ‘Thy spirit dobbin in extreems was such ‘That if Ill bound uncheckd in luckless hours ‘Theyd left thee grappling wi unequal powers ‘When worn fatigued upon yer knees yed dropt ‘&amp; tuggl'd at it till yer breath'd bin stopt ‘&amp; ere yed yielded boy I know yer pride ‘Yer heart yed bursted neath the load &amp; dyd ‘&amp; thou at other works wer still as good ‘First rate in most the name of dob[b]in stood ‘At lighter jobbs that gentler ways require ‘Thou still woudst do them to the hearts desire ‘&amp; tho so turbulent when strength wer claimd ‘A gentler soul then dobbin cant be namd ‘Mild as a lamb a very child might guide ‘&amp; walk undangerd by his gentle side ‘Thou from our wenches dob near faild of praise ‘For faithful steadiness on market days ‘Thou might lack speed but none had safer legs ‘For brittle loads of butter &amp; of eggs ‘&amp; tho of time thou needed greater share ‘&amp; on thy journey neer had much to spare ‘Yer trusty safty rarely known to fall ‘Oer stones &amp; ruts made recompence for all ‘Ye never rund away nor turnd askew ‘From sheep or shadows as a many do ‘Nor woud ye hazard dangers ways so cheap ‘Were nothing tempted ye to urge a leap ‘No spur ere made coud make Ill answer fort ‘Ye risk the hazard of your neck for nought ‘No trifle frit ye &amp; Ill bound a mile ‘Ye'd sooner go then shortn't oer a stile ‘So maids on dobbin knew themselves secure ‘&amp; lovd his slowness as it provd so sure ‘I always lovd thee boy &amp; love thee still ‘&amp; cannot praise too much say what I will ‘For Ive with thee done many a hardy job ‘&amp; felt well suited if I had but dob ‘Wi out a driver Ive gone plough wi thee ‘&amp; thurrows drawn as straight as lines coud be ‘For e'ery servant boasted in the pride ‘To be wi dobbins usfull aid supplyd ‘To have him in their teams for well they knew ‘A horses worth that coud be trusted too ‘Those days are past &amp; dobbin thou art dead ‘On the same pasture were thoust often fed ‘&amp; oft as tented on this self same plain ‘Were oer thee now I tell my tale in vain ‘Ive markd thee dob full many a youthful day ‘To kick &amp; gallop in thy wanton play ‘While thy bright skin betrayd the feeds of corn ‘Which I cribd for thee every night &amp; morn ‘Tho partners had their share—I none woud pine ‘But a spare quartern always doubld thine ‘&amp; thou Ill answer fort deservd the bait ‘&amp; none that knew thee will be shamd to sayt ‘A better horse then thee neer pulld at rack ‘Nor was gears lifted oer a worthier back ‘Nor will a collar witness stauncher blood ‘Then thines bin dobbin be they ere so good ‘Tho on the pasture now thy carcass lies ‘The mangling sport of croaking crows &amp; pies— ‘Tho thoud some failings dobbin so have all ‘But then to call em faults there most too small ‘In thy young days full often when at morn ‘Ive fetchd thee up from pasture to thy corn ‘Ive missd thee from the rest on tresspass strayd ‘While faithless dews thy footing tracks betrayd ‘Full fond of toothsome bits thou oft was found ‘In lawless plunderings on a neighbours ground ‘&amp; spite of stiffnd joints from toil &amp; sweat ‘&amp; sharp rebukes thy meddlings often met ‘Tho in thy toils the gentlest slave on earth ‘&amp; heavy heeld a carter from thy birth ‘Woud often blunder thro the fences way ‘To taste a stack of clover or of hay ‘Boys whips might switch thee wi unwelcom hits ‘But I near chid thee for thy pilferd bits ‘Nor didst thou fear me dobbin in the least ‘When ere I catchd thee at thy savory feast ‘Thou knew old friends that never usd thee ill ‘&amp; neighd a welcome &amp; stood eating still ‘&amp; while the rest was driving on before ‘Woud cheerly follow to the stable door ‘I never knew it sin thy name I knew ‘To prove thee skewish from the halters view ‘No fickleness was never known in dob ‘Prefering freedom to a hardy job ‘But now old boy thourt lost to toil &amp; me ‘&amp; crows &amp; pies to pick thy bones are free ‘&amp; thou I says thoust bin a worthy slave ‘&amp; did I own thee thou shoudst find a grave ‘Free from the crews that worn out worth devours ‘But thourt not mine &amp; all is past my powers ‘I can but praise thee dob &amp; mourn thy fate ‘&amp; that Ill do while tongue I have to say't ‘Poor dobbin’—here he pausd &amp; lookd around &amp; markd his master in a distant ground Which dampt at once his praises &amp; his pains &amp; urgd him hastening to his toils again Tho oft he turnd back looks upon his mate &amp; sighd repeatings on his partners fate Whose name full oft in unheard mutterings fell ‘Poor dobbin worthy dobbin fare thee well’ The pies &amp; crows that watchd in neighbouring shade At nats retreat a joyful chattering made Left free once more upon his bones to feast The common end of many a worthy beast RURAL EVENING The sun now sinks behind the woodland green &amp; twittering spangles glow the leaves between So bright &amp; dazzling on the eye it plays As if noons heats had kindld to a blaze But soon it dims in red &amp; heavier hues &amp; shows wild fancy cheated in her views A mist like moister rises from the ground &amp; deeper blueness stains the distant round The eye each moment as it gazes oer Still loosing objects which it markd before The woods at distance changing like to clouds &amp; spire points croodling under evenings shrouds Till forms of things &amp; hues of leaf &amp; flower In deeper shadows as by majic power With light &amp; all in scarce percievd decay Puts on mild evenings sober garb of grey While in the sleepy gloom that blackens round Dies many a lulling hum of rural sound From cottage door farm yard &amp; dusty lane Were home the cart horse tolters with the swain &amp; padded holm were village boys resort &amp; bawl enrapturd oer their evening sport Till night awakens superstitions dread &amp; drives them prisoners to a restless bed Thrice happy eve of days no more to me Who ever thought such change belongd to thee When like to boys whom now thy gloom surounds I chasd the stag or playd at fox &amp; hounds Or wanderd down the lane with many a mate To play at swee swaw on the pasture gate Or on the threshold of some cottage sat To watch the flittings of the shrieking bat Who seemly pleasd to mock our treacherous view Woud even swop &amp; touch us as he flew &amp; vainly still our hopes to entertain Woud stunt his rout &amp; circle us again Till wearied out wi many a coaxing call Which boyish superstition loves to brawl His shill song shrieking he betook to flight &amp; left us puzzld in short sighted night Those days have fled me as from them they steal &amp; Ive felt losses they must shortly feel For sure such ends makes every bosom sore To think of pleasures they must meet no more Now from the pasture milking maidens come With each a swain to bear the burthen home Who often coax them on their pleasant way To soodle longer out in loves delay While on a molhill or a resting stile The simple rustics tries their arts the while With glegging smiles &amp; hopes &amp; fears between A snatching kiss to open what they mean &amp; all the utmost that their tongues can do The honyd words which nature learns to woo The wild flowers sweets of language ‘Love’ &amp; ‘dear’ With warmest utterings meets each maidens ear Who as by magic smit she knows not why From the warm look that waits a wishd reply Droops fearfull down in loves delightfull swoon As slinks the blossom from the suns of noon While sighs half smotherd from the throbbing breast &amp; broken words sweet trembling oer the rest &amp; cheeks in blushes burning turnd aside Betrays the plainer what she strives to hide The amor[o]us swain sees thro the feignd disguise &amp; proves the fondness she at first denies &amp; with all passions love &amp; truth can move Urges more strong the simpering maid to love More freely using toying ways to win Tokens that echo from the soul within Her soft hand nipping that with ardour burns &amp; timid gentlyier presses its returns &amp; stealing pins with innoscent deciet To loose the 'kerchief from its envyd seat &amp; unawares her bonnet to untye Her dark brown ringlets wiping gently bye To steal a kiss in seemly feignd disguise As love yields kinder taken by supprise While she near conquerd less resentment move[s] &amp; owns at last mid tears &amp; sighs she loves With sweetest feelings that this world bestows Now each to each their inmost souls disclose Vow to be true &amp; to be truly taen Repeat their loves &amp; vow it oer again &amp; pause at loss of language to exclaim Those purest pleasures yet with out a name &amp; while in highest extacy of bliss The shepherd holds her yielding hand in his He turns to heaven to witness what he feels &amp; silent shows what want of words consceals &amp; ere the parting moments hussles nigh &amp; night in deeper dye his curtain dips Till next days evening glads the anxious eye He swears his truth &amp; seals it on her lips At evens hour the truce of toil tis sweet The sons of labour at their ease to meet On piled bench beside the cottage door Made up of mud &amp; stones &amp; sodded oer Were rustic taste at leisure trimly weaves The rose &amp; straggling woodbines to the eaves &amp; on the crouded spot that pails enclose The white &amp; scarlet daisey rears in rows &amp; trailing peas in bunches training neat Perfuming even with a luscious sweet &amp; sun flowers planting for their gilded show That scale the windows lattice ere they blow &amp; sweet to 'habitants within the sheds Peep thro the diamond pane their golden heads Or black smiths shop were ploughs &amp; harrows lye Well known to every child that passes bye By shining share that litter on the floor &amp; branded letters burnt upon the door &amp; hard burnt cinders flung as usless bye That year by year in some spare corner lye Were meddling boys their ready weapons meet To pelt each other up &amp; down the street Or aught that pleases each mischievous eye As harmless hogs &amp; bullocks passing bye Or squatting martins neath the eves at rest That oft are wakd to mourn a ruind nest &amp; sparrows now that love their nests to leave In dust to flutter at the cool of eve For such like scenes the gossip leaves her home &amp; sons of labour light their pipes &amp; come To talk of wages wether high or low &amp; mumbld news that still as secrets go As gossips knowledge of awaited births Expected marriages &amp; dreaded deaths &amp; heedless seen to all the rest may say The beckoning lover nodds the maids away &amp; at a distance many an hour employs In jealous wisperings oer their amorous joys As childern round their teazing sports prolong To twirl the top or bounce the hoop along Or shout across the street their one catch all Or progg the hous'd bee from the cotters wall While at the parish cottage walld wi dirt Were all the cumbergrounds of life resort From the low door that bows two props between Some feeble tottering dame surveys the scene By them reminded of the long lost day When she her self was young &amp; went to play &amp; turning to the painfull scenes agen The mournfull changes she has met since then Her aching heart the contrast moves so keen Een sighs a wish that life had never been &amp; vainly sinning while she strives to pray Half smotherd discontent pursues its way In wispering providence how blest shed been If lifes last troubles shed escapd unseen If ere want sneakd for grudgd support from pride Shed only shard of childhoods joys &amp; dyd &amp; as to talk some passing neighbours stand &amp; shoves their box within her tottering hand She turns from echos of her younger years &amp; nips the portion of her snuff wi tears RUSTIC FISHING On sunday mornings freed from hard employ How oft I mark the young mischevous boy With anxious haste his poles &amp; lines provide For make shifts oft crookd pins to threadings ty'd &amp; delve his knife with wishes ever warm In rotten dunghills for the grub &amp; worm The harmless treachery of his hooks to bait Tracking the dewy grass wi many a mate To seek the brook that down the meadows glide Where the grey willow shadows by its side Were flag &amp; reed in wild disorder spread &amp; bending bulrush bows its taper head &amp; just above the surface of the floods Where water lileys mount their snowy buds On whose broad swimming leaves of glossy green The shining dragon flye is often seen &amp; hanging thorns whose roots washd bare appear That shields the morehens nest from year to year While crowding osiers mingling wild among Prove snug asylums to her brood when young Who when suppris'd by foes approaching near Plunge neath the weeping boughs &amp; dissapear There far from terrors that the parson brings Or church bell hearing when the summons rings Half hid in meadow sweet &amp; kecks high flowers In lonly sports they spend the sunday hours Tho ill supplyd for fishing seems the brook That breaks the weald in many a stinted crook Oft choakd in weeds &amp; foild to find a road The choice retirement of the snake &amp; toad Then lost in shallows dimpling restlessly In fluttering struggles murmuring to be free Oer gravel stones its depth can scarcly hide It runs the remnant of its broken tide Till seemly weary of each choakd controul It rests collected in some gulled hole Scoopd by the sudden floods when winters snow Melts in confusion by a hasty thaw There bent in hopfull musings on the brink They watch their floating corks that seldom sink Save when a warey roach or silver bream Nibbles the worm as passing up the stream Just urging expectations hopes astray To view the dodging cork then slink away Still hopes keep burning with untird delight Till wobbling curves keep waveing like a bite If but the breezy wind their floats shoud spring &amp; move the water with a troubling ring A captive fish still fills the anxious eyes &amp; willow wicks lie ready for the prize Till evening gales awaken damp &amp; chill &amp; nip the hopes that morning suns instill When resting flyes have tired their gauzy wing Nor longer tempt the watching fish to spring Who at the worm nor nibbles more repeat But lunge from night in sheltering flag retreat Then dissapointed in their days employ They seek amusment in a feebler joy Short is the sigh for fancys provd untrue With humbler hopes still pleasure they pursue Where the rude oak bridge scales the narrow pass Half hid in rustling reeds &amp; scrambling grass Or stepping stones stride oer the narrow sloughs Which maidens daily cross to milk their cows There they in artless glee for minnows run &amp; wade &amp; dabble past the setting sun Chasing the struttle oer the shallow tide &amp; flat stones turning up were gudgeons hide Hopes visions with success here runneth high &amp; on a rush they string the little frye All former hopes their ill success delayd In this new change they fancy well repayd &amp; thus they wade &amp; chatter oer their joys Till night unlookd for young success destroys Drives home the sons of solitude &amp; streams &amp; stops uncloyd hopes ever freshning dreams Who then like school boys that at truant play In sloomy fear lounge on their homward way &amp; inly trembling as they gain the town To meet chastisment from a parents frown Where hazel twigs in readiness prepard For their long abscence brings a mete reward SUNDAY WALKS How fond the rustics ear at leisure dwells On the soft soundings of his village bells As on a sunday morning at his ease He takes his rambles just as fancys please Down narrow baulks that interscet the fields Hid in profusions that its produce yields Long twining peas in faintly misted greens &amp; winged leaf multitudes of crowding beans &amp; flighty oatlands of a lighter hue &amp; speary barley bowing down with dew &amp; browning wheat ear on its taper stalk With gentle breezes bending oer the baulk Greeting the parting hand that b[r]ushes near With patting welcomes of a plentious year Or narrow lanes were cool &amp; gloomy sweet Hedges above head in an arbour meet Meandering down &amp; resting for awhile Upon a moss clad molhill or a stile While every scene that on his leisure crowds Wind waving vallies &amp; light passing clouds In brighter colors seem to meet the eye Then in the bustle of the days gone bye A peacful solitude around him creeps &amp; nature seemly oer its quiet sleeps No more is heard save sutherings thro the trees Of brisk wind gushes or a trembling breeze &amp; song of linnets in the hedgrow thorn As twittering welcomes to the days return &amp; hum of bees were labours doomd to stray In ceasless bustle on his weary way &amp; low of distant cattle here &amp; there Seeking the stream or dropping down to lare &amp; bleat of sheep &amp; horses playfull neigh From rustics whips &amp; plough &amp; waggon free Biting in carless freedom oer the leas Or turnd to knap each other at their ease While neath the bank on which he rests his head The brook mourns drippling oer its pebbly bed &amp; wimpers soothingly a calm serene Oer the lulld comforts of a sunday scene He ponders round &amp; muses with a smile On thriving produce of his earlier toil What once was curnels from his hopper sown Now browning wheat ears &amp; oat bunches grown &amp; pea pods swelld by blossoms long forsook &amp; nearly ready for the scythe &amp; hook He pores wi wonder on the mighty change Which suns &amp; showers perform &amp; thinks it strange &amp; tho no philisophic reasoning draws His musing marvels home to natures cause A simple feeling in him turns his eye To where the thin clouds smoak along the sky &amp; there his soul consents the power must reign Who rules the year &amp; shoots the spindling grain Lights up the sun &amp; sprinkles rain below The fount of nature whence all causes flow Thus much the feelings of his bosom warms Nor seeks he further then his soul informs A six days prisoner lifes support to earn From dusty cobwebs &amp; the murky barn The weary thresher meets the rest thats given &amp; thankfull sooths him in the boon of heaven &amp; sabbath walks enjoys along the fields With loves sweet pledges poddling at his heels That oft divert him with their childish glee In fruitless chaces after bird &amp; bee &amp; eager gathering every flower they pass Of yellow lambtoe &amp; the totter grass Oft wimpering round him dissapointments sigh At sight of blossoms thats in bloom too high &amp; twitching at his sleeve their coaxing powers To urge his hand to reach the tempting flowers &amp; as he climbs their eager hopes to crown On gate or stile to pull the blossoms down Of pale hedgroseys straggling wild &amp; tall &amp; scrambling woodbines that outgrows them all Turns to the days when he himsen woud teaze His tender father for such toys as these &amp; smiles with rapture as he plucks the flowers To meet the feelings of those lovly hours &amp; blesses sundays rest whose peace at will Retains a portion of those pleasures still &amp; when the duty of the days expird &amp; priest &amp; parish offerd whats requird When godly farmer shuts his book again To talk of profits from advancing grain Short memory keeping what the parson read Prayers neath his arm &amp; business in his head &amp; dread of boys the clerk is left to close The creaking church door on its weeks repose Then leave me sundays remnant to employ In seeking sweets of solitary joy &amp; lessons learning from a simpler tongue Were nature preaches in a crickets song Were every tiney thing that lives &amp; creeps Some feeble language owns its prayer to raise Were all that lives by noise or silence keeps An homly sabbath in its makers praise There free from labour let my musings stray Were foot paths ramble from the public way In quiet lonliness oer many a scene This grassy close or Grounds of blossomd bean Oft winding baulks were groves of willows spread Their welcome waving shadows over head &amp; thorns beneath in woodbines often drest Inviting strongly in their peace to rest Or wildly left to follow choice at will Oer many a trackless vale &amp; pathless hill Or natures wilderness oer heaths of goss Each foot step sinking anckle deep in moss By pleasing interuptions often tyd An hedge to clamber or a brook to stryde Were nought of 'proaching feet or noises rude Molests the quiet of ones solitude Save birds song broken by a false alarm Thro branches fluttering from their fancyd harm &amp; cows &amp; sheep the startld low &amp; bleat Disturbd from lare by ones unwelcome feet The all thats met in sundays slumbering ease That rather adds then checks the power to please &amp; sweet it is to creep ones blinded way Were woodland boughs shuts out the smiles of day Were hemmd in glooms that scarce give leave to spy A passing cloud or patch of purple sky Tracking half hidden from the world beside Sweet hermit nature that in woodlands hide Were namless flowers that never meet the sun Like bashing modesty the sight to shun Buds in their snug retreat &amp; bloom &amp; dye With out one notice of a passing eye There while I drop me in the woody waste Neath arbours nature fashions to her taste Entwining oak trees with the ivys gloom &amp; wood bines propping over boughs to bloom &amp; scallopt briony mingling round her bowers Whose fine bright leaves make up the want of flowers With natures minstrels of the woods let me Thou lord of sabbaths add a song to thee A humble offering for the holy day Which thou most wise &amp; graciously hast given As leisure dropt in labours rugged way To claim a passport wi the rest to heaven THE WIDOW OR CRESS GATHERER Soon as the spring its earliest visit pays &amp; buds wi march &amp; aprils lengthend days Of mingld suns &amp; shades &amp; snow &amp; rain Forcing the crackling frost to melt again Oft sprinkling from their bosoms as they come A dwindling daisey here &amp; there to bloom I mark the widow &amp; her orphan boy In preparation for their old employ The same lorn figures as they usd to be Rags pinchd with hungry care from poverty The cloak &amp; hat that had for seasons past Repelld the rain &amp; buffeted the blast Tho worn to shreddings still are occupyd In makeshifts way their nakedness to hide For since her husband dyd her hopes are few When times wore out the old to purchase new Upon the green theyre seen by rising sun To sharp winds croodling they woud vainly shun Wi baskets on their arms &amp; hazel crooks Dragging the sprouting cresses from the brooks A savory sallad sought for luxurys whim Tho small reward her labours meet from him When parceld out she humbly takes for sale The simple produce of the waterd vale In yearly visits to some market town Meeting by turns a penny &amp; a frown Of all the masks desception ever weaves Life thines the visage that the most decieves One hour of thine an emperors glory greets Another turns him begging in the streets Een this poor wretch thy meanest link who lives On scantest sustenance that labour gives Has known her better days when thou times gone Een condescended to look kind upon Times went not thus when abler hands supplyd Thy vain existance ere her husband dyd Who various ways a living did pursue Clerk of the parish &amp; schoolmaster too Who puntual always rung the evening bell &amp; sung amen on sundays loud &amp; well &amp; tho not nice in this &amp; that respect Was rarely found his duty to neglect His worldly ways religions neer perplext He never faild to reccolect the text Or quote the sermons passages by heart In warm devotion oer an honest quart &amp; as a brother of those subtle tools That makes such figuring in our country schools He lovd his skill to flourish &amp; to shew As well as godly he was learned too Tho wi the boast most common to his kin The use of figures he knew little in By far too puzzling for his head was they He sought fames purchase by an easier way &amp; like his scholars with his a b c Was found more ready then the rule of three In 'rithmetic &amp; such like crabbed stuff Far as reduction he deemd learnd enough Hed other learning nigher hand for him &amp; that he could not reach he calld a whim Hed many things to crack on with his ale For clowns less learned to wonder at the tale &amp; oer his pot hed take the news &amp; preach &amp; observations make from speech to speech Till those around him swore each wise remark Showd him more fit for parson then for clerk &amp; hed to minutes tell when moons were new &amp; 'clipses talk about the seasons thro &amp; saint days all the callender declares Run oer as ready as hed read his prayers &amp; change of weather jud[g]ing foul or fine Mystic conclusions drawn from many a sign Of dripping moons or suns in crimsons set To him sure tokens as to fair or wet &amp; wonders telling from the yearly store That fills the learned almanacks of moor Earthquakes &amp; plagues &amp; floods were known &amp; when From second father noahs days till then Till most gave out had he divulgd his trade Hed made best almanacks that ere was made &amp; wonderd greatly when he dyd to find He left no fragment of his art behind &amp; as he always for the sake of fame Conseald the sources whence his learning came His artless listners who of books none knew 'Sides the large bibles in the parsons pew Thought he more things then lawful understood &amp; knowledge got from helpers none too good When he was living shed her comforts then &amp; knew no trials to support her sen Tho industry woud oft from leisure steal Odd hours to knit or turn the spinning wheel Choice is not misery she had neighbours fare Got hand to mouth &amp; descent cloaths to wear Tho joys fall sparing in this checkerd life Wide difference parts the widow from the wife Encroaching want showd not such frightfull form Or drove her dithering in the numbing storm Picking half naked round the brooks for bread To earn her penny ere she can be fed In grief pursuing every chance to live That timly toils in seasons please to give Thro hot &amp; cold some weather as it will Striving wi pain &amp; dissapointed still Just keeping from expiring lifes last fire That pining lingers ready to expire The winter thro near barefoot left to pull From bramble twigs her little mites of whool A hard earnd sixpence when her mops are spun By many a whalk &amp; aching finger won &amp; eeking hirpling round from time to time Her harmless sprotes from hedges hung wi ryhme The daily needings wants worst shifts requires To hunt her fuel ere she makes her fires When she while grinning to the hissling blast Wi buds or berries often breaks her fast In summer time the little rest of care Is every morning cheated of its share &amp; ere one sunbeam glistens in the dew The long wet pasture grass she dabbles thro Where sprouts the mushroom in the farey rings Which nights black mistery to perfection brings &amp; these she seeks ere gins her daily toils As extra gains to labours scanty spoils By every means thus lingering life along &amp; daily struggling gainst a stream too strong &amp; thus from year to year thro foul &amp; fine Shed sooner labour tho its but to pine Then meet severer woes mid threats &amp; frowns Of those brute emperors of little towns Whose very names awakens want to tears When force compells to seek its overseers Whose ears are shut on griefs severest sighs Whose hearts are marble when the hungry cries Railing at mouths that open to be fed Entailing curses in the lieu of bread Who een the bed of death stands tearless bye Were want droops famish'd on his straw to dye When justice drives em as in dutys part To offer kindness while its grudgd at heart &amp; as they turn them from the sufferers fate Een sneer to witness that its brought too late Truth draws the picture coarse as is the blame &amp; he who drew it once had provd the same Had freezing want his constant clouded sky Kept him in darkness hid from pitys eye Who heard his sorrows &amp; wi instant aid Stoopd down to bear him from the chilly shade Above the level of misfortunes den Were bloodhounds harbour neath the masks of men To which tho justice now &amp; then may turn &amp; blunts the weapons yet the cure detains She seems half sleeping while she hears em mourn &amp; shuts her eyes upon their keenest pains THE WORKHOUSE ORPHAN A Tale Some childish memorys linger while were men Or pains or pleasures as they touchd us then Freshing with knowledge as our feelings will Till manhood comes &amp; there they linger still Old shepherd robin childish ere he dyd I knew him well &amp; every boy beside For he has joind our sports with childish glee &amp; seemd as happy in our mirth as we He twirld the top &amp; boasted in the powers To jelt his pebble farther off then ours &amp; smild in raptures as we praisd his skill While making willow whistles or a mill &amp; large keck trumpets—powers he lovd to show &amp; much delighted learning us to blow &amp; tales hed tell us while he tended sheep We wept to hear &amp; he himself woud weep For tales of sorrows he woud often tell &amp; one that touchd as I remember well He often told it nor left grief to cold &amp; still it warms me when it last was told Twas moaning autumn in her oldest hours When we'd spent many vainly seeking flowers &amp; found him pottering from the rising wind To the best shelter which the fields coud find We joind his steps &amp; dissapointments sighd &amp; sought a tree &amp; sat us by his side ‘Childern he said the autumns withering hours ‘Has snatchd away your summer &amp; your flowers ‘Far different this to summers warmer day ‘When with my hook I reachd yon boughs of may ‘&amp; tyd with rushes easy gatherd flowers ‘Far different those to these decaying hours ‘Yellow are leaves half naked is the bough ‘&amp; neer a blossom has the pasture now ‘So be content &amp; spend an hour with me ‘Ill tell a tale that like the time shall be ‘A tale of tender sorrows which I've told ‘Times out of number both to young &amp; old ‘Poor Mary Lee she was a child with me ‘&amp; one for sorrow she was born to be ‘A hard &amp; cruel world in this she found ‘She met its vice &amp; sunk beneath the wound ‘She sunk but kept her hopes nor feard to find ‘The hard ill usuage which she left behind ‘Nor livd she long leaves oft have left the tree ‘Reminding mortals what their end must be ‘&amp; grass &amp; weeds have often spread anew ‘On other graves since first on hers they grew ‘Tho wide the world were early hope depends ‘Poor Mary met it destitute of friends ‘Left a lorn orphan when her years was few ‘&amp; parish pity was too early due ‘I had a mother but in shame was born ‘She married after but I kept the scorn ‘&amp; she had boys which she as mother prizd ‘But her first born was born to be despisd ‘With Mary Lee the parish was my lot ‘&amp; its cold bounty all the friends I got ‘Dragd from our childhoods pleasures &amp; its plays ‘We pind in workhouse sorrows many days ‘Were many wants recievd their scant supply ‘Were pity never came to check the sigh ‘Save what laws force from tyrant overseers ‘Whose bitter gifts was purchasd with our tears ‘There ragd &amp; starvd &amp; workd beyond our powers ‘We toild those hours you spend in gathering flowers ‘Nor mothers smiles had we our toils to cheer ‘But tyrants frowns &amp; threatnings ever near ‘Who beat enfeebld weakness many times ‘&amp; scoft misfortunes agonys as crimes ‘While prides vain childern of a luckier race ‘Were taught to shun our presence as disgrace ‘Thus workhouse misery did we both abide ‘Till our own strength its poverty supplyd ‘&amp; service freed us—freedom did we find ‘In labour there to slavery left behind ‘&amp; Mary grew in spite of every harm ‘To womanhood &amp; not without its charm ‘Tho pride to me was not of scorn bereft ‘&amp; yet disdaind me thro the fate I left ‘It smild on her &amp; she believd the praise ‘Of men that wrongd her in her helpless days ‘&amp; soon she found she did too soon believe ‘That worst of foes befriending to decieve ‘A big young coxcomb farmer Follys son ‘Wisperd in secret how his heart was won ‘&amp; Mary sure the person must admire ‘Of one whose manners apd the country squire ‘Who mockd gentility with dog &amp; gun ‘&amp; quirkd the fields as many such have done ‘Were humbler gents their leisure to amuse ‘From this pretender oft recievd abuse ‘Branding the honest with a poachers blame ‘While he himself deservd a viler name ‘He robd the game with freedom unreservd ‘For which his betters paid to be preservd ‘&amp; on these walks when mary sought her cows ‘He sought his chances &amp; renewd his vows ‘Were soon his civil flatterys gaind their end ‘While he with pride oft entertaind a friend ‘With bragging storys how the fool was won ‘&amp; laughd it off &amp; calld it precious fun ‘At length by time convincd awakend fears ‘There follys learnd &amp; she implord in tears ‘While the vile wretch ere she her griefs begun ‘Scoft her with names for guilt himself had done ‘&amp; at those tears which shame coud not depress ‘He sneerd &amp; mutterd “Strumpets meet distress” ‘So worser fate &amp; added griefs to shun ‘Force sought the dungeon were they first begun ‘Griefs harmless then now torturd with disgrace ‘Their shamless misery now a hiding place ‘Worse was her lot &amp; humbler was her fees ‘When justice faild her tyrants power to teaze ‘Want wins its favour tho oft slow to win ‘But reason guides it to discourage sin ‘Forcd as the father to the child he paid ‘But left to want its mother he betrayd ‘Boys when yere men have better pride to feel ‘Then wound a heart ye never mean to heal ‘Now pind &amp; starvd despisd by all she knew ‘Too weak for toil yet wishing to pursue ‘Some means for life now linkd with tender tye ‘Which but for that had been a joy to dye ‘She made her matches &amp; her burthen bore ‘To seek compassion at a strangers door ‘But pity deigns not with the proud to live ‘&amp; poor that feel it have not power to give ‘Small was the sum her last rescource supplyd ‘&amp; did but little for her wants provide ‘&amp; wragd &amp; wretched from sad misereys shed ‘While yielding paths betrayd a shoeless tread ‘She oft was seen to wander round the fields ‘&amp; sought the berrys which the autumn yields ‘Feeding with birds that twitterd by her side ‘Content to spare her what the proud denyd ‘Thus oft half famishd she from town sojournd ‘&amp; went one morning nor at eve returnd ‘Search soon was made—tho one of small respect ‘Yet feard disgrace forbid them to neglect ‘While one heart doubtless in its hopes was high ‘That fate had freed him &amp; expence was bye ‘Nor if that heart coud be were hopes unblest ‘Search found the mother &amp; the child had rest ‘But reasons abscence did her griefs beguile ‘&amp; madness gave her sorrow strength to smile ‘She kissd it oft &amp; offerd succour still ‘&amp; held it to her bosom cold &amp; chill ‘Then moand &amp; bowd as one that trys to weep ‘&amp; smild agen &amp; hushd its endless sleep ‘Poor perish'd child what it had lingerd in ‘&amp; that night sufferd for anothers sin ‘To see such horrors made me quite distrest ‘For I was one to seek her with the rest ‘As weakness to return that night denyd ‘She crept for shelter which the fields supplyd ‘&amp; found an hovel were shed seemly taen ‘Grass for her infants cradle pulld in vain ‘She seemd to know me but she never spoke ‘Yet wishd it seemd to tell her heart was broke ‘For to her heart she oft her hand woud bear ‘&amp; lookd more piteous as she placd it there ‘Again we took her to misfortunes den ‘But joys or sorrows knew no difference then ‘Pride now felt pity when she coud not live ‘&amp; gave its trifle when too late to give ‘No reason ere returnd to feel the ill ‘&amp; death soon came &amp; made her happier still ‘There luckless mary had of pain its share ‘There life met grief &amp; parted with despair ‘In the cold grave from every ill she slept ‘Nor felt the distance which distinction kept ‘North side the church no choice will occupy ‘Force finds the workhouse tenants room to lye ‘Where cold winds frown &amp; sunbeams never come ‘There mary rested in a better home ‘A lone cold corner by the charnell pent ‘Were nettles spread her only monument ‘Childern ye weep but few the years yeve met ‘&amp; reasons young to think of sorrows yet ‘But when yere men &amp; infants climb your knee ‘Then will ye feel &amp; think of Mary Lee’ THE FATE OF GENIUS A Tale Far from the life of market towns was seen The humble hutts &amp; spire of topal green Were from the treetops that the hamlet shields The white spire mounts &amp; over looks the fields Meeting the distant view of passing eyes Were gentle memory often points &amp; sighs For there amidst the ignorance it wears Wants chilling views &amp; labours ceasless cares A rustic genius from the darkness sprung &amp; sought the muses mid his toils &amp; sung &amp; warmd with hopes while nature round him smild He himnd their raptures &amp; his fate beguild But evil light thro his oblivion gleamd The world wore smiles his artless hopes esteemd &amp; warmd with raptures better days to meet They sought applause &amp; realizd the cheat Soon envys wasps around his sweets did swarm &amp; peacfull muses fled the rude alarm Soon fames vain follys from their ambush rose Friends while theyre powerless but in public foes This praisd as fine what that as faults accusd That urgd amendments which the next abusd Thus mid the wild confusion babel raisd By one advisd by others scofft &amp; praisd The damps of dissapointment provd too much &amp; warm hopes witherd at the chilly touch Shrinking from life &amp; hopes emblazoned noon To witness envy had its own too soon &amp; what remains now linger to be blest Aside that church were friendship tells the rest Who placd a stone to mark his lowly sleep That kindred hearts might find the spot to weep Were the old sexton deaths undaunted slave Who knew the bard &amp; dug his early grave To each request enquireys warmth may raise Oft gives the tale of his unnoticd days In hopes calm walks ere flattery smild his friend &amp; black injustice bade their journey end ‘I knew him from a child’ the clerk woud say ‘&amp; often noticd his dislike to play ‘Oft met him then lone left by woods &amp; streams ‘Muttering about as people do in dreams ‘&amp; neath lone bushes dropt about the field ‘Or peacfull hedges that woud shelter yield ‘With hand beneath his head in silence bent ‘Oft saw him sit &amp; wonderd what it meant ‘Nor did his habits alter with his age ‘Still woods &amp; fields his leisure did engage ‘Nor friends nor labour woud his thoughts beguile ‘Still dumb he seemd in company &amp; toil ‘&amp; if ones questions did his dreams supprise ‘His unconscern oft pausd in wrong replys ‘We wonderd many times as well we might ‘&amp; doubted often if his mind was right ‘Een children startld from his oddness ran ‘&amp; shund his wanderings as “the crazy man” ‘Tho harmless as the things he mixd among ‘His ways was gentle &amp; unknown to wrong ‘For Ive oft markd his pity passing bye ‘Disturb the spiders web to save the flye ‘&amp; saw him give to tyrant boys a fee ‘To buy the captive sparrows liberty ‘Each sundays leisure brought the woods their guest ‘&amp; wildest spot which suited him the best ‘As bushy greens &amp; valleys left untilld ‘Were weedy brooks went crooking as they willd ‘Were flags &amp; reeds &amp; sedge disorderd grew ‘These woud his abscence from his home pursue ‘&amp; as he rambld in each peacful round ‘Hed fancy friends in every thing he found ‘Muttering to cattle—aye &amp; even flowers ‘As one in visions claimd his talk for hours ‘&amp; hed oft wonder were we nought coud see ‘On blades of grass &amp; leaves upon the tree ‘&amp; pointed often in a wild supprise ‘To trifling hues of gadding butterflys ‘While if another made new marvels known ‘That seemd to me far wonderous then his own ‘Of ghosts hed seen that nightly walks decievd ‘He heeded not but laughd &amp; disbelievd ‘Nights dismal tongues that hardest hearts affright ‘&amp; all may hear that travel out at night ‘Her shadowd howling tenants fierce &amp; grim ‘Tho trifles struck him—such was nought to him ‘At length twas known his ways by woods &amp; brooks ‘Were secret walks for making ryhmes &amp; books ‘Which strangers bought &amp; with amazment read ‘&amp; calld him poet when they sought his shed ‘But men they said like serpents in the grass ‘That skulk in ways which learning has to pass ‘To slander worth which they woud feign posses ‘&amp; dissapointment urges to suppress ‘Snarling at faults too bright for common minds ‘&amp; hiding beautys wisdom warmly finds ‘Such marr'd his powers &amp; slanderd in disguise ‘&amp; tryd to black his merits with their lyes ‘&amp; tho his friends the cheating fraud descryd ‘It hurt too earnest to be wipd aside ‘He dwindld down from too severe a blast ‘&amp; hopes might wish to live that dyd as fast ‘Still he did live till real life seemd as gone ‘&amp; his soul lingerd in a shadowd one ‘&amp; yet he mingld in his favourd ways ‘&amp; bar'd his forhead to the sunny days ‘Listning the lark on fountains moaning wave ‘As like a ghost as ever left its grave ‘&amp; fled the world at last without a sigh ‘&amp; dyd as gentle as a lamb woud dye ‘His learned friends said envys aim was blest ‘That malice killd him—they might know the best ‘Else folks less learnd to different causes led ‘Who read his books &amp; marveld as they read ‘Were he so free of ghost &amp; fairey talks ‘They thought he found them on his lonley walks ‘&amp; that some secret which he faild to keep ‘Brought on their anger &amp; his endless sleep ‘Be as it might his life fell in decay ‘&amp; that stone tells when it was calld away ‘Were een the daiseys that around it spread ‘The gifts of spring to dress his lowly bed ‘Are often stole in garden scenes to grow ‘As relics of the dust that sleeps below ‘While the stones verses hid by summers weed ‘Which strangers eager trample down to read ‘Are bye the curious often written down ‘Tho they tell nought of praises or renown’ ‘Here sleeps the hopes of one whose glowing birth ‘Was found too warm for this unfeeling earth ‘That frownd &amp; witherd—yet the fruitfull stem ‘Hides here &amp; buds with others warm as them ‘Waiting that sun to warm their bloom to smile ‘&amp; welcome heaven as their native soil PASTIME IN SUMMER Give me the leisure of a summers day With one old friend to loiter it away Were level meadows stretch their green domains Alive with joys of laughing maids &amp; swains Some making hay beside our pleasant paths &amp; mowers sweeping with their even swaths Neath sheltering haycocks some &amp; willow bowers Soaking the bottle in their booning hours Discoursing onward with our lines &amp; hooks With some refreshments nor without some books Cheerd by the rural objects as we pass To were trees shadows keepeth green the grass Checking intrusions of the summer suns There drop us down close were the river runs In sight of rural sounds &amp; pleasing strife That warms the laughing landscape into life &amp; while in cheerfull mirth as we prepare Our sporting things &amp; bait our angles there With flye or fish of artificial forms To shun the anguish of the wreathing worms Feel warm hopes glow with earnest eagerness To mark the signs that promise us success As gleaming suns that twitter while they gleam &amp; dance their blazing shadows in the stream Were small black moths dip light their fluttering wings &amp; heedless fishes leap in bouncing springs Curving the flood tho winds withold their breath In ceasless eddies with their playfull mirth Then free from bother of entangling weeds As we throw in were clear the stream proceeds Watch for the trembling float that shows a bite &amp; followd jerks that dodge it out of sight While taper angles as we eager rise Bend as we pull &amp; prophesy the prize Thus sporting on till weary with the cheat The fish get wise &amp; sicken &amp; retreat Our quiet floats more shoyley sliding bye To jump at distance for the dancing flye Leaving us then our leisure to regale To sip refreshment from our hoarded ale &amp; loll upon the grass neath willows grey To view the scene or talk the hours away Or with my Thompson added joys engage Reading the season in his blooming page Were budding springs eternally appear &amp; fragrant summers freshen all the year There while the willow oer the water spreads &amp; bushes throw dark shadows oer our heads Well fancy Damons rapt in daring dreams &amp; Musidora's shrinking to the streams With flowing hair let loose upon the breeze Oer maddening charms a Damon only sees White breasts &amp; burning cheeks that redder glow To see the image in the flood below Tho our real scenes perfections fail to give Were Musidoras of less beauty live Yet there are Damons that as warmly burns &amp; maidens lov'd that make as kind returns &amp; then as weary of our reading hours Wed shut our books &amp; look upon the flowers Or any scene that might engage the eye As bumming by us went the dragon flye In wonders admiration often led To mark confusions nature round us spread Inscects on constant travel as they past Shows each new comer different to the last &amp; butterflyes whose varied painted wings Boasts every hue that summers glory brings Like the gilt eyes in peacocks feathers some Some hued like flowers to which their wanderings come In namless colours others sport the plains Hued as misterious as their birth remains Then cropping flowers that round our sitting dwells Nor marvel less to meet so many smells Each different scent possest by different tribes Sense easy feels but ignorance describes For like the mistery wonder left before We know we feel it &amp; we know no more Thus woud we muse oer natures varied book Were fresh enchantments rose at every look That with new wonders on our senses come &amp; still delight us till we ramble home When suns sink downward with a reddening face &amp; blue clouds fringe as if with golden lace Sunk 'hind the meadows bridges calm &amp; chill &amp; thro the arches peep'd upon us still While blue cool haziness approachd us round &amp; misty patches smoakd about the ground When reeds &amp; flags that rustld by our seat As if their bloom was witherd by the heat Now greend agen from gifts which night recieves As forming dewdrops moisten on the leaves When laughing labour left its toils &amp; glee &amp; sought its dwellings with the housing bee Whose mournfull hums bewails declining day While waking crickets welcome it away &amp; fluttering larks betook themselves to rest &amp; with less caution passd us to their nest Then woud we leave what leisure had pursued &amp; in our memorys feel the joy renewd MAGGYS REPENTANCE Twas sunday eve the sun was out of sight &amp; left the west sky with a yellow light While that small wind that ushers night apace Was fluttering cool on summers burning face &amp; that sweet light had blest each lovers eye That brings one star to glimmer in the sky When maggy dreaming tween regrets &amp; doubt Took up her hat &amp; pale &amp; soodld out To the high elms that spread their hanging boughs Oer the low hovel were she milkd her cows Nigh to the house but not as one coud hear &amp; yet so nigh that night brought little fear For in eves sunbeams ere the last was oer There longest shadows nearly reachd the door A favourd spot were memorey fondly dwelt Were simple love first wisperd what it felt The spot were robin met her void of guile &amp; told his vows &amp; often milkd the while Were still hed met had he not found it vain When maggys folly urgd him to refrain There past her usual hour to shun the talk Of gay companions on their sunday walk She drove her milking oft to be alone &amp; make an hour of Solitude her own Care urgd the lonly comforts which she sought &amp; thus for ease she mutterd what she thought ‘I well may hate the dancing &amp; the night ‘That brought a coxcomb in my silly sight ‘Whose dress &amp; follys lur'd my heart about ‘&amp; made me fancy man was nought with out ‘I hate the night I met wi footman Tim ‘&amp; turnd of[f] robin to take up with him ‘I shoud be crazy in that luckless hour ‘To let white stockings have such foolish power ‘&amp; lapell coats in fashion with the squire ‘I shoud be crazd such tinsel to admire ‘&amp; those vile monkey methods in the dance ‘Which he would wisper “master learnd in france” ‘I stood astounded at the mongrel pride ‘&amp; smiles of wonder hadnt power to hide ‘Which made him caper twenty times the more ‘&amp; like parchd peas he jumpd about the floor ‘&amp; such quere names his foreign dances had ‘A downright puzzle were the memorys bad ‘Waltzes we did like punches dolls efeth ‘&amp; jumpd &amp; hugd till I was out of breath ‘&amp; he stept figures poor conscieted fool ‘Which he pretended fashion learns at school ‘&amp; sure enough ere half the night was oer ‘I had my surfeit &amp; coud smile no more ‘Such foolish tricks so fussy to repeat ‘I realy felt as sickend with consciet ‘Hed beg girls poseys as he bugd along ‘To let them hear how he coud use his tongue ‘&amp; oft unbidden out his watch was taen ‘To show the hour but more the watch &amp; chain ‘&amp; while he stood his cash was chinkd about ‘To let folks know his pockets want without ‘&amp; hed pull off his gloves his nails to bite ‘Wi mere excuse to show his hand was white ‘&amp; kept his waiscoat open at the chin ‘To show a frilld shirt &amp;

every twig thro wood &amp; plain Were summer hing her greening bough Wild winters mockerey cloaths again With hoary shapes &amp; shadows now The street is throngd with bawling boys Who pat their reddend fingers warm &amp; eager after dithering joys Unheeding brave each pelting storm To roll their jiant forms of snow Or slide—or seeking rude repast Hirpling by hedges were the slow Hangs mellowd by the biting blast Past noons thawd snow along the street Stiffend to ice now night has been Oft baulks the maidens stepping feet Who falls &amp; blushes to be seen While amourous feelings inly warms Some passing clown who turns to steal A glimpse of modestys alarms Which such like accidents reveal In winters surley depth how sweet To meet those comforts we desire Possesing some snug corner seat Were blazes nigh the welcome fire Warming ones toes upon the hearth &amp; reading poems not too long While basks the cat in purring mirth While crickets sing their winter song &amp; winters tiresome hours to cheat Have means to visit now &amp; then Were neighbours oer their tankard meet &amp; there the corner share agen Each confort suiting best to chuse To sit &amp; crump warm penny rolls Or take short snatches oer the news While warms the nappy on the coals &amp; when suns creep the[i]r warmest height &amp; north winds wisper nearly still When greening patches meet the sight On southward slant of bank or hill &amp; berrys freed from rhyme awhile Shines red on hedgrow twigs again One may a midday hour beguile To walk in shielding wood &amp; plain To track some woodlands gentle ride Where hanging branches lend a screen Or banks slopd down on either side Were sheltering vallys creep between As down such hollows one proceeds We instant feel a warmer day While mong each bank tops rustling weeds Winds noise their unfelt rage away Each twig when touchd tho hardly stird Its white shower litters to the ground &amp; from the shake of startld bird The ryhme like powder puthers round &amp; as one fails those tracks to meet By shepherds made &amp; foddering boys The snow shrinks from our hastning feet Harsh crumping with incessant noise Now view the prospect were we will On woods above or vales below Or nigh or distant winter still Stretches his dazzling scene of snow The very spire points catch the eye As changd with winters frowning pride &amp; were a sunbeam cannot lye Shine whitend on their northern side The arch of light around us bowd Stretches for days its cloudless skye Save freckling shadows of a cloud That loose to nothing passing bye Tho clouds oft darken closing day &amp; round the north disorderd lye Like rocks with bases torn away On nothing hung 'tween earth &amp; skye Nature that pauses nearly dumb But startles some complaint to make Not like the buried busy hum Which banishd summer kept awake— Were sheep their bleating wants reveal &amp; hollow noise of bawling cow That wait the fodderers stinted meal Is all ones walks can listen now Save when some clown with beatle breaks The ponds thick ice for stock to drink Wild noises round the village wakes From geese that gabble on the brink Who mope &amp; brood about the snows When frost their plashy sport destroys Till such scant chance relief bestows To urge afresh their squalling joys Oft oer one flyes the chirping lark With rhyme hung round his chilly breast Complaining of some dogs rude bark That scard him from his chilly rest &amp; oft from snowbanks ridgy edge The hare steps hirpling oer the plain Till found a bush or bunch of sedge Then drops its ears &amp; squats again &amp; feebly whines the puddocks wail Slow circling naked woods around &amp; wild geese ranks that swifter sail Oft start one with a hoarser sound While towering at the farthest height The heron brawls its lonley cry Who interscepts the dazzld light &amp; looks a cloud speck in the skye The herdboys drawling noise is oer &amp; all the scenes his summer saw His cows now haunt each threshers door &amp; pick in sullen mood the straw The ploughmans song is vanishd now &amp; quawking rooks &amp; chattering pyes Are silent all—each idle plough Froze in the snow hid furrow lyes Made bold by want in many a flock The ringdoves flye from solitude &amp; mingling share with friendly stock A portion of their winter food A meal which providence bestows Were hardy turnip roots abound &amp; oft one sees upon the snows Their little footmarks dinted round Cold woods the blackbirds gladly shun Were round their perch the 'icles freeze &amp; courts less shy the noonday sun &amp; hops about our garden trees &amp; little birds with hunger tame To cottage yards undaunted go Were pity warms some gentle dame To scatter crumbles round the snow Yet all save robins will retreat &amp; shun rude mans forbidding sight Who seemly welcomes trampling feet &amp; ruffs its feathers in delight Brisk hopping from its shielding thorn As one who woud our steps detain Then droops its wing &amp; sits forlorn When left to solitude again In blackening droves the rook &amp; crow Flap the cold air with heavy wings To seek what home will not bestow As soon as morn the summons brings Full many a weary mile they flye To try what stranger fields will spare Till eve returns her freezing sky Then wearied to their homes repair Tho dolld about reservd &amp;

ravens croaking on the wing &amp; crows will clamours dittys raise All busied with the hopes of spring When thaws mock winters warmest days The stock now huddld side to side From winters nipping rage to brood Will then disperse &amp; wander wide Nor wait the fodderers call to food Yon sullen steed that hangs his head Will prick his ears in pleasure then &amp; by the pastures promise fed Will plunge in frolic joys agen The swain then whistles to his sheep Nor plods his dog behind his heels As he was wont from winds to creep But runs at random oer the fields Chasing the startld hare by guess Then stops &amp; barks his master on &amp; in his antic joys excess Forgets his puppy days are gone Each bank smiles in the sunny hours As sweet as those the spring provides Save that they want the daisey flowers &amp; white lambs basking by their sides Mays mildness mocks the gladdend sky &amp; clouds as swiftly clouds pursue Save that no swallow cares to flye Nor cuckoo sings the story true Thus some few days may idly dwell &amp; hold the tempting season still &amp; tempt the early buds to swell For lurking winters blast to kill &amp; many a flower on sunny slopes That startles up the spring to see Is doomd to loose their early hopes &amp; perish in their infancy &amp; oft one views the hairy leaves Of woodbines in the shelterd plain Sprouting when winters thaw decieves To perish when he frowns again &amp; pity often mourns to meet A daisey smiling to the sun Unconsious of the tempting cheat That fancys gentle spring begun But short is natures waking hopes A frowning cloud may cross the skyes When sun &amp; warmth &amp; all elopes &amp; shriveld leaf &amp; daisey dyes As cuckoos songs in summer cease As swallows from the autumn flew So flyes in mistery winters peace &amp; storms steal on to frown anew &amp; give me then as now at eve The chimney corners idle joys As days cold scenes my rambles leave To list the kettles simmering noise &amp; while the chimney mocks the blast &amp; windows quake with jarring din Let doors &amp;

field &amp; forest leaves the dazzld view One blea cold picture neath her stretching shroud Doll'd round our paths in scant unwilling ways As one who hates to please or to be pleasd Winter has beautys well deserving praise Tho with the ague of its frowns diseasd Those icey drops which nights chill fingures mould At each thorn point—as if by magic done Changes to spangles bright as fancyd gold Now morn illumnes them with its slanting sun The green woodpecker now resumes his joys Perching a sunnyside decaying oaks Uttering its harsh but not unpleasant noise &amp; wakes small echos with its tapping stroaks While the hoarse raven croaking as she flyes &amp; rooks &amp; daws that clamorous dittys bring &amp; sailing puddock with its shiller cries All please ones wanderings as the voice of spring Again the shepherd whistles to his sheep Nor more the dog plods hirpling at his heels As he was wont from winter winds to creep But pants in random races oer the field Chasing the crows or startld hares by guess Then hurrying back to bark his master on &amp; in the antics of his joys excess Almost forgets his puppy days are gone Yet when the sun is at its warmest height &amp; bares the shining berries on the hedge Tis well to wander were the winds despight Expends its fury mid the witherd sedge That crowns some sloping bank the lane along Were springs first green &amp; snows the soonest melt Whose rustling leaves increase the winds wild song Still threatning tumults that is calmy felt Dumb is the voice of nature save the sounds Of sad complaining cattle here &amp; there Lorn cows &amp; sheep that track the snowy grounds &amp; look in vain for grass &amp; utter wild despair &amp; now &amp; then the lorn unroosted lark Will chirp its note of sadness &amp; complain Of scaring steps &amp;

linger round their haunts in vain Till such scant chances gives them leave to swim &amp; there they clamour till its froze again Now as one fails the beaten track to meet Of milking maids &amp; early foddering boys The snow harsh presses neath ones hastning feet Crumping &amp;

round us bowd Stretches for days his bright unclouded skye Save odd thin streaks mere shadows of a cloud That loose to nothing as they pass the eye &amp; save as round the north in grim delay The verging threatnings of a storm is given Clouds like huge rocks with bases torn away Tottering on nothing tween earth &amp;

blasts blow blessings every time they blow That golden showers in mercey fall to bless The half thatchd mouldering hovels of distress That edens self in freedoms infant sphere Was but a desert to our Eden here That laws so wise to choke the seeds of strife Here bless a beggar with an Adams Life Ah what an host of Patronizers then Woud gather round the motley flatterers den A spotted monster in a lambkins hide Whose smooth tongue uttered what his heart denied Theyd call his genius wonderous in extream &amp;

a hunting Squire &amp; their old mansions that was dignified With things far better then the pomp of pride At whose oak table that was plainly spread Each guest was welcomd &amp; the poor was fed Were master son &amp; serving man &amp; clown Without distinction daily sat them down Were the bright rows of pewter by the wall Se[r]ved all the pomp of kitchen or of hall These all have vanished like a dream of good &amp; the slim things that rises were they stood Are built by those whose clownish taste aspires To hate their farms &amp; ape the country squires The old oak table soon betook to flight A thing disgusting to my ladys sight Yet affectations of a tender claim To the past memory of its owners name Whose wealth prides only beauty stood her friend &amp; bought a husband that same wealth to spend Laid it aside in lumber rooms to rot Till all past claims of tenderness forgot Bade it its honourable name resign Transformed to stable doors or troughs for swine Each aged labourer knows its history well &amp;

can they thus who love themselves to view Chuse to be vexd to find the picture true Be as it will none but the base are bit &amp; satire shows them as they chuse to sit Which if disliked they may improve with ease &amp; make the likeness [better] if they please &amp; satire stingless—follys &amp; defects While yet defective still its glass reflects But when they cease to be as heretofore It suits with others &amp; is theirs no more Some of the old school yet my verse coud tell &amp; one from boyhood I remember well Who near aspired on follys wings to soar A plain mean man scarce noticed from the poor Who near expected as he walkd the street Bows from inferiors whom he chancd to meet Inferiors bred from fashions idle whim Equals &amp; neighbours all appeard to him &amp; tho wealth scornd in such low walks to go &amp; pride disdaind &amp; called his manners low He sought nor paid prides homage unto man But lived unshining in his humble plan &amp; when his rights tyrannic power assaild His courage triumphd tho his pocket failed For he was doomd to feel that worldly curse An upright spirit &amp; an empty purse Nor did he try the shamless fault to cure Still keeping honest &amp; remaining poor But he has left &amp; one of different race Spoilt his old mansion &amp; supplied his place Nor left he there in seeking were to dwell One heart save prides but inly wishd him well Thus fortune oft dishousd by blinded guess Bids honour starve &amp; knavery meet success Smiles on the wickeds ways their hopes to glad &amp; sinks the good man to maintain the bad Proud Farmer Cheetum turnd a rogue by stealth Whom prosperous times had ripend into wealth Hunting &amp; shooting had its ceasless charm When his full purse cared little for a farm A trusty hand was left to plough &amp; plan The double trade of master &amp; of man He kept his stud for hunts &amp; races then &amp; dogs fed even better then his men Bought loves &amp; changed them when the freak was old &amp; drank his wine without a wife to scold &amp; gaind a dashing name &amp; livd in style &amp; wore a mask to profit byt the while For he who dares to do a deed of shame Feels none &amp; only knows it by the name &amp; made large credit while his name was good For all woud trust him draw on whom he woud A man so stylish none coud dream to doubt Till changing times the secret brought about The grains sunk price oer knaverys tricks was thrown &amp; others failings well excused his own The times he said &amp; frownd disturbd &amp; sad Needed no comment to explain them bad So ere he broke he honestly confest His wealth all gone &amp; credit had the rest &amp; proved to all a smuggling rogue too late Cheat creditors—turnd bankrupt—&amp; still great Hunt shoots &amp; rackets as he did before &amp; still finds wealth for horses dogs &amp; whore &amp; dogs &amp; wh? &amp; horses in his train Are all that have no reason to complain These show his kindness in their varied ways &amp; gild his rotting name with dirty praise Like as when brooks are dry the village sinks Boast their full dingy tide that flows &amp; stinks That seems to boast when other streams are dry ‘Neath summer suns how brave a dyke am I’ Old Saveall next whose dirty deeds &amp; fame Might put a young bards silken lines to shame But my plain homespun verse lets none escape Nor passes folly in its rudest shape When satires muse puts on a russet gown Tho vermin start as game she runs them down So Saveall shall have place whom fortunes smiles Unmixed with frowns hath made him known for miles Famous for riches &amp; by knavery prized &amp; famed for meaness &amp; by work despised Who trys to buy a good name &amp; decieve With fair pretentions that but few believe Who seldom swears &amp; that but now &amp; then A smuggled oath when vexd by better men That beard hypocrisy with honest grace &amp; tears the mask from cants decieving face Yet in religion he is made elect &amp; buys with wine the favours of the sect Making each spouter welcome when he comes &amp; turning beggars from their fallen crumbs Pleading up charity in whining tones &amp; driving dogs at dinner from the bones The scraps which beggars plead for serve his swine So their lorn hopes seek other doors to dine The broken bones enrich his land for grain So dogs beneath his table wait in vain On neighbourly good will he often dwells &amp; in dry times locks up his very wells &amp; if twas but of worth we might suppose Hed even save the droppings of his nose Such is this Saveall first of fortunes fellows Famous for wealth great farms &amp; small beer cellars With the elect most saintish or most civil &amp; with the rest a cunning knave or devil Poor honour now yields to the stronger side A wrinkld maid turnd stale &amp; past her pride Knavery &amp; cant in triumph take her place Unblushing strumpets with a tempting face Religion now is little more then cant A cloak to hide what godliness may want As painters deaths to make the terror less Wrap their dry bones within a cheating dress The world is of a piece words mostly make The little difference for distinctions sake Vice must own bad so virtue takes the best Coarse is the one mere cobweb is the rest &amp; when encroaching vice with cunning deeds To make a hole in virtues garb succeeds Tis but indeed a customary case She darns it up as none may spy the place &amp; if once caught by slanders jealous eye Tho breaches double &amp; holes multiply Virtue awhile turns penitent &amp; then Like rifled maid her title claims agen Their prayers are read as old accustomd things &amp; offerd up for all souls save the kings They love mild sermons with few threats perplexd &amp; deem it sinful to forget the text Then turn to business ere they leave the church &amp; linger oft to comment in the porch Of fresh rates wanted from the needy poor &amp; list of taxes naild upon the door Little religion in each bosom dwells &amp; that sleeps sound till sundays chiming bells When from each shelf is regularly took The weekly wanted pious dusty book Seeking the church an hours good prayers they read &amp; hear a sermon as the all they need Then read when home the reccolected text &amp; lay religion by till sunday next Some with reform religions shade pursue &amp; vote the old church wrong to join the new Casting away their former cold neglects Paying religions once a week respects They turn from regular old forms as bad To pious maniacs regular[l]y mad A chosen race so their consciet woud teach Whom cant inspired to rave &amp; not to preach A set of upstarts late from darkness sprung With this new light like mushrooms out of dung Tho blind as owls i'th' sun they livd before Consiet inspired &amp; they are blind no more The dru[n]ken cobler leaves his wicked life Hastes to save others &amp; neglects his wife To mend mens souls he thinks himself designd &amp; leaves his shoes to the uncalld &amp; blind He then like old songs runs the scriptures oer &amp; makes discoverys never known before Makes darkest points as plain as A B C &amp; wonders why his hearers will not see Spouts facts on facts to prove that dark is light &amp; all are blind till he restore their sight &amp; swears the old church which he cast away As full of errors &amp; as blind as they &amp; offers prayers no doubt as prayers are cheap For chosen shepherds to his worships sheep Thinking the while if such the will of fate Self might become a hopeful candidate &amp; doubtless longs shoud reformation call To leave his own &amp; take his neighbours stall Part urgd as scripture more as self consiet To suit his ends each passage he repeats &amp; in as various ways each fact he weaves As gossips riddles upon winter eves Now storming threats now pleading comforts mild In puleing whine soft as a sucking child The[y] cant &amp; rave damnations threats by fits Till some old farmer looses half his wits Looks back on former sins tho loath to doubt Groans oer a prayer &amp; thinks himself devout Then learnings lookd on as an idle jest &amp; the old cobler preaches far the best Who smooths with honied hopes the deep dyd sinner &amp; earns reward—a lodging &amp; a dinner Their former teachers as blind guides they mock Nor think them chosen for the crazy flock The crazy flock believe &amp; are depraved &amp; just in time turn ideots to be saved The Ranter priests that take the street to teach Swears god builds churches where so ere they preach While on the other hand protestant people Will have no church but such as wears a steeple Thus creeds all differ yet each different sect From the free agents to the grand elect Who cull a remnant for the promised land That wear heavens mark as sheep their owners brand Each thinks his own as right &amp; others wrong &amp; thus keeps up confusions babel song While half the tribes at bottom are no more Then saints skin deep &amp; devils at the core Who act by customs &amp; as custom shows Lay bye religion with their sunday cloaths Religions aim is truth &amp; different creeds By different channels for that aim proceeds But many wander muddy by the way &amp; dark with errors struggle far astray Till weary with the toil they fainter creep &amp; then like stagnant waters stink &amp; sleep Religions truth a plain straight journey makes Which falshoods wandering never overtakes As gold when purified flows free from dross &amp; leaves the worthless mixture without loss So from black errors truths eternal morn Mounts into light &amp; smiles the night to scorn Tis not religion but its want when sects Rail each at each to hide their own defects For calmness quiet cheerfulness &amp; love Its essence is to aid our hopes above Tis vain philosophy that would decieve The[y] heer too much to doubt or to believe What is &amp; was we feel—what is to be Truth nothing knows tis guess pretends to see Een earths least mysterys are above our skill &amp; would-be-gods are but her childern still Wisdom still searching with her flickering flame Lost in her mysterys dwindles to a name Whence goeth light when evening hides the sun &amp; whence the darkness when the night be done Hither it cometh—aye—&amp; there it goes Is the whole sum which mighty wisdom knows So resignation should the worst befall &amp; faith to hope the best is best of all Old Ralph the veriest rake the town possesd Felt sins prick deep &amp; all his crimes confest Groand oer confessions to his ranting priest &amp; prayd &amp; sang &amp; felt his soul released The new births struggles made him wonderous wan &amp; feebly prayd at first the baby man Twixt doubts &amp; fears yet viewd the cured complaint &amp; scarce percieved the devil from the saint But soon the ‘outward man’ grown godly mad Felt the good spirit triumph oer the bad &amp; cants dull prayers too lame to visit heaven Lookd oer past sins &amp; fancied all forgiven He then whind lectures in a happier strain &amp; coaxd poor sinners to be born again Shund old companions once beloved so well As condemnd transports on the way to hell &amp; prayd &amp; sang from sin &amp; pain releasd &amp; smoothd his hair &amp; fashiond for a priest Old women heard him with oerjoyd delight Some cryd &amp; sind &amp; others turnd out right Theyd read the gospel studied good St Paul But ralp[h]s good doctrine was the best of all From him they found their old religions stuff Was nought but like a play at ‘blind mans buff’ A pathless journey in a starless night Till good St Ralp[h] restored the way to light &amp; thus as priest he exercised his wits Forcd men to prayers &amp; women into fits &amp; heard &amp; cured each difficult complaint &amp; midst his flock seemd little less then saint But hell untired with everlasting watch (The fox grows cunning when preys hard to catch) Crept into Ralphs new planted paradise &amp; met success in tempting him to vice A simpering eve did in his garden dwell &amp; she was fair &amp; he grew fond—&amp; fell Twas love at first but een when that began The sinking saint grew more &amp; more the man &amp; with his eve so treache[r]ously fair Coud feel more joy then kneeling down to prayer Yet still he prayd nor deemd his case so bad As stone blind sinners tho his heart was sad The bible still he read with saintly looks &amp; deemd all others as ungodly books Unless a patch of scripture here &amp; there Redeemd each page &amp; made them godly ware Tho sinfull love had overpowerd his skill With other sins he kept unspotted still He drank nor swore &amp; when a lye was told Twas just gains trifle when he bought &amp; sold When bretheren met he woud his joys express Groand while they prayd &amp; said amen by guess Then ‘da—&amp; blame ye’ hed no further dare Hell coud not urge the fallen man to sware Till the compleation of his serpent sin Urgd by the devil sunk him to the chin Eve tho beguild forbidden fruit to haste Had lovd an adam ere she loved the priest &amp; ere disgrace had ripend into light Ralph had no power to wed her &amp; be right His fate was evident it came at last His sheep was judge &amp; shepherd ralph was cast Then drink &amp; rackett joind their former friends &amp; new born saint in the old sinner ends Next comes a name who spite of all controuls Reigns oer the bodys ills as Ralph the souls A mighty doctor—what so thickly sown That een the Parish can a doctor own Yes own one too whose power so splendid shines As een to name illuminates my lines For every mouth is puckered with his skill So sing his patients &amp; so say his bill The worst disease he does so quick subdue That makes some think the devil helps him through But what care they who helps—if pain endured So long before he rose can now be cured By reading in their water all their ails &amp; conjuring medicines up that never fails Thus all the country join his fame to raise &amp; few but D? Urine gets the praise So now for skill the parish rules the roast Renowned for Quacks that Citys cannot boast —Ah where in City or in Town can dwell Famed D? Urine thy rare parrarell No where indeed to match at once with thee Thy mighty fame &amp; humble pedigree But can that taint the Laurel on thy brows 'Cause thou wert wont to docter Swine &amp; cows &amp; rose to fame as fame was took by force From giving judgment on a cholicked horse To read the water of poor sickly clowns &amp; ease them not of illness but their crowns Tho every ill swims on thy majic glass &amp; at thy conjuring bidding rise &amp; pass Like Mackbeths murdered spirits grimly on &amp; thou thy powers scheme cures for every one Een from the boasting of thy self—&amp; thine Thy duped deciples—such thy fame doth shine As if the dead were not beyond thy skill But might be quickened from thy power &amp; pill— The poor old woman now half blind &amp; lame With age—has room to curse thy greedy fame For she herself had fame ere thou hadst thine &amp; did as doctress of the Village shine Tho one rare salve was cure for every sore That Salve &amp; that famed Doctress' race is oer Say D? Urine why—(&amp; dont deride My gossiping enquirey) shouldst thou hide In such poor paltry Parish this renown As seems well worthy of the finest town Nay rather City for Im sure thy name &amp; Waterbottles might extend thy fame To every patient that had death to fear Then say good Docter why so linger here Thourt no great ‘schollard’ that the learned tell &amp; all that buy thy drugs might know as well But it so turns &amp; lucky for thy pelf Thy patients are less ‘schollards’ then thyself —But what of learning words mispelt is small Drawbacks on knowledge that gives cures for all Distempers &amp; diseases as he wills &amp; almost cures a broken limb with pills The learned faculty are tools to thee &amp; from thy powers like thy complaints will flee Then why thus linger in the worst of towns To cure &amp; hear the praise of foolish Clowns But fools perhaps may be thy only game To feed thy pockets &amp; encrease thy fame If so think not in greater towns to shine Where skill would bid thy juggling tricks decline &amp; bright eyed reason send thee hasty back Proving thee what thou really art a quack So D? Urine in thy nest remain &amp; till the dull dark age of fools be past As conjuror &amp; Water Doctor reign Then drop into thy grave—a Quack at last In politics &amp; politicians lies The modern farmer waxes wonderous wise Opinionates with wisdom all compact &amp; een coud tell a nation how to act Throws light on darkness with excessive skill Knows who acts well &amp; whos designs are ill Proves half the members nought but briberys tools &amp; calls the past a dull dark age of fools As wise as solomons they read the news Not with their blind forefathers simple views Who read of wars &amp; wishd that wars woud cease &amp; blessd the king &amp; wishd his country peace Who markd the weight of each fat sheep &amp; ox The price of grain &amp; rise &amp; fall of stocks Who thought it learning how to buy &amp; sell &amp; he a wise man who coud manage well No not with such old fashiond idle views Do these news mongers trafic with the news They read of politics &amp; not of grain &amp; speechify &amp; comment &amp; explain &amp; know so much of parliment &amp; state Youd think them members when you heard them prate &amp; know so little of their farms the while That can but urge a wiser man to smile Young Brag a ‘jack of all trades’ save his own From home is little as the farmer known He talks with all the equal &amp; the high Equally ready to tell truth or lie His betters view him in his just deserts But equals deem him one of mighty parts Opinions gratis gives in mens affairs Fool in his own but wonderous wise in theirs Upon his talents friends were strongly bent Mistook his parts &amp; off to school he went A young aspiring hopeful youth at least Whose parents deemd him fashiond for a priest Twas somthing urgd the dissapointed view With which religion had the least to do Tho they baskd blessd in fortunes wealthy sun They yearnd for more to bless their hopeful son Whom school &amp; colledge both had vainly taught &amp; learnd young hopeful to be fit for naught His friends decievd beheld the faded charm Resignd weak hopes &amp; placed him in a farm &amp; there he lives &amp; to great skill pretends &amp; reigns a god among his farming friends Scrats paragraphs &amp; sends them to the News Signd ‘constant reader’ lest they shoud refuse The illspelt trash on patriotic cavils Leaving correction to the printers devils Skits upon those by whom theyre never read Who might as well write Letters to the dead Or puffs upon himself in various ways Whom none but self will either read or praise &amp; Poems too the polishd patriot chimes Stanzas to Cobbets truth &amp; Comic Ryhmes To which he fits a hacknied tune that draws From patriot dinners echoes of applause &amp; in the next weeks news out comes the treat From ‘constant reader’ of the drunken feat Were so much wine is lavishd in the strain As even to make the reader drunk again Were every dish on which the knaves regale Find places there but common sense &amp; ale For common sense is grown too tame to teach &amp; ales too low to aid a patriots speech &amp; morts of speeches made to back reform That raised applauses like a thunder storm &amp; almost loosd the rafters from their pegs While chairs &amp; tables scarce coud keep their legs Reeling amid the hiccups &amp; hurra's &amp; glass[es] rung &amp; almost dancd applause Nor will he pass his comic singing oer For they too set the table in a roar &amp; then concludes it with the pompous clause —Success to patriots &amp; the good old cause A hacknied tune which patriots daily sing Like variations of ‘God save the King’ But when election mobs for battle meet &amp; dirty flags &amp; ribbons throng the street Hunting for votes some little borough town Tis there his genius meets the most renown When on the hustings bawling spouters throng Who fight &amp; war like women with the tongue All speakers &amp; no hearers were the crys Piles up confusions babel to the skys &amp; croaking at the top in proud renown Each party sits till tother pulls him down Here shines our orator in all his plumes Nor prouder bantum to a dung hill comes Then he to crow &amp; peck &amp; peck &amp; crow &amp; hurl bad english at retorting foe No hungry magpie round a rotten sheep A longer song of nonsence up can keep Were small words all their utmost powers engage &amp; monnysyllables swell mad with rage Who martyrs like to freedoms noble cause Are choaked by scores in hiccups &amp; hurras The rest awhile in thick disorder flye &amp; from his mouth like crackers bounce &amp; dye ‘I said’—‘says I’ &amp;—then—‘he said’—‘says he’ Are the chain balls of his attillery That storm &amp; threaten at the deadly breach &amp; link the weapons of his broken speech The head &amp; tail piece setting off &amp; close That throws each sentence at his sneering foes &amp; when his monny syllables have spent Their rage &amp; given his utmost fury vent &amp; wore the cant thread bare that serves the throng Like summers cuckoo tune for every song Of ‘Rotten boroughs—‘bribery’—‘tyrants’—‘slaves’ Were selfs a patriot &amp; opposers knaves To fill the void his lack of words will cause He bawls out freedom &amp; expects applause Then bows his head in oratorial grace &amp; exit makes to give new speakers place So have I seen the schoolboy in his sport (When playing soldiers) honours praise to court Spout to his fancied army on parade Bawling of valour ere the assault was made Then drew his ‘wooden sword’ &amp; led the way To storm their castles &amp; commence the fray Pointing their pellets at unconsious foes At bantum cocks that on the dung hill crows When pop each gun went to commence the quarrel Nor scared the flye that settled on the barrel He ryhmes election squibs &amp; meet[s] applause From party critics that support his cause His fustian wit trots wild on broken feet Jostling the readers patience from his seat Half prose half verse they stagger as they go &amp; after fashions follys dribbling flow One line starts smooth &amp; then for room perplext Elbow along &amp; knock against the next &amp; half its neighbour then a stop marks time To close the sense—what follows is for ryhme Pert forwardness &amp; insolent consiet In bard &amp; patrons close as circles meet All that is bad from one to tother jumps Both play at cards &amp; turn up knaves as trumps &amp; his bad wares in credits way to push He boasts theres nought to make the modest blush Tho common sense he neither fears or heeds Who finds a cause to blush at all she reads To see its name with fools as partners shown &amp; cursed with trash which dullness shrinks to own Yet in the columns of the weekly News They shine as laureat odes to ‘Pinks’ or ‘Blues’ Where humbug patron of cants tinsel gauds Reads &amp; with Fudge so sanctions &amp; applauds One blows the bubble up with puffing sides &amp; tother marks till stiff necked how it rides Bawling aloud till hoarse ‘look here now there’ Till mobs throng round to wonder &amp; to stare Then flattery puffs a critique in their cause &amp; gain throngs in with interest &amp; applause So boys with their tobacco pipes &amp; suds Play while one bubble after tother scuds Look there a fine one goes &amp; there another How bubble two beats bubble one his brother Then blows again with cheeks distended wide Till like the frog he almost bursts with pride Then out goes bubble three &amp; instant out From gaping mouths come the applauding shout That makes his pride &amp; happiness redouble &amp; soap baloons flye up in many a bubble Humbug still hailing with excess of joy Who condescends to feed both men &amp; boy With this small difference the boys sports are stinted Tho humbug praises theres no puff to print it He games &amp; drinks &amp; rackets up &amp; down A low livd mocker of high life in town &amp; sips his wine in fashionable pride &amp; thrusts in scorn the homely ale aside His fathers riches bought such foolish airs But wasting fortunes een must need repairs As parching summer checks the runnels haste The greatest wealth will lessen spent in waste Tho credit proves him poor his stubborn pride Oer acts his purse &amp; struggles dignified Yet stung with tidings that his consience vents He rails at tythes &amp; hopes for falling rents Curses all taxes as tyrannic things &amp; hates the pride of government &amp; kings Forgetting self tho on the brink to fall A shade of mightier consequence then all Turnd radical in spirit &amp; in purse He prays reform &amp; deems the laws a curse Speaks treasonous things before his friends &amp; cousins &amp; toasts reforming patriots by dozens &amp; aping wit with ignorant delight A village politician turns out right Burdett &amp; Brougham his Bibles place supplys &amp; these he reads &amp; studys &amp; applys But choaks their wit to pass his narrow brains &amp; steals the stingless carcass for his pains Like to the Daw dressed in the Peacocks coat He gives proud utterance to each stolen note While laughter roars he seems on clouds to walk For laughter is the chorus of small talk Election hums &amp; Placards on the throne He mars the joke &amp; makes the rest his own Runs reason mad in his unreasoning matters &amp; twists &amp; tears poor common sense to tatters Yet while he mimics second hand &amp; storms &amp; mocks each echo hooting for reforms &amp; rants with oratorial pause &amp; start Each stale grown speech of patriots oer by heart He meets applause in every spouting fit By those who take impertine[n]ce for wit Friends gape &amp; wonder while they hear him preach &amp; swear it Ciceronian every speech But others view him in wits sneard remark A toothless puppy that can only bark He hails his countrys foes his only friends D?ms peace &amp; prays for war that never ends Its ruins lookd on as the way to wealth &amp; grace for all meals is reforms good health &amp; why is all this hubbub for reforms This anxious looking for expected storms That turns each fireside into parliments In strong debates of taxes tithes &amp; rents Is aught of general good or general views Sketchd in the pathway which reform pursues Or is the rich mans lands or misers pelf But grudgd in others to be claimd by self Doubtless the reasons far more plain then good Is far more true as such then understood Our village politician clings no doubt To one sole cause that moves the rest about His general good perhaps is small akin To self a core that smuggles in that skin Taxes no doubt might be at peace &amp; stand If theyd sink claims on his conserns &amp; land &amp; such forcd things as Landlords yearly claims He hates no doubt—tho fear but inly blames &amp; views reform in but a selfish light To make a level far as self is right Turn Lords to farms or farmers change to Lords Is the dear wish that with his heart accords Or when all laws are ruind with the throne Just but to make the farm he rents his own Thus far no farther tho with reasons leave Want pleads for times of adam &amp; of eve This must not be they toild for bread before &amp; some must still be rich &amp; some be poor To sink the many &amp; exalt the few Is still his creed in an extended view Reform thus leveld to brags selfish will Want still might toil &amp; be contented still With other nations mid tyranic strife This miscalld mania[c] struggles oft to life Fair is the mask that hides its visage first But soon the infant to a fiend is nursd That like a wolf howls hungerly &amp; high A cry for blood—&amp; freedom apes that cry For Freedom unrestraind forsakes her cause &amp; lawless pleasures are her only laws Like as high tempests reckless whom they harm Come headlong on their pleasures to perform Too late the trees beneath their burthen groan The lawless storm feels treason in that tone &amp; down its whole artillery lightning hail &amp; thunder comes the rebels to assail Prostrate at once the groves in ruins lye Their torn roots pleading pity from the sky So with the tyrant whom he wills he blames Mere treason is what ere his vengance names &amp; where that falls—defence—complaints—aye sighs Are discontents &amp; treasons in disguise Thus laws grow lawless &amp; the patriot dies Dies &amp; above his poor insulted dust Fears made to sanction that the deed was just Such is the case when freedom like a flood Bursts out in mischief what was meant as good So thy proud lilys haughty france was torn Whose whitness dared the insulted light to scorn &amp; scorn did come &amp; thou wert weak indeed Torn down &amp; trampled like the meanest weed Thy laws a tyrants scoffing stock became &amp; thy white flag blushed red for very shame When by a tyrants pompous threats unfurled To show its former weakness to the world Who mocking liberty where none remained With stronger fetters former rights enchained Heaven shield thee England in thy ancient cause From tyrant governments &amp; broken laws Since freedom came &amp; crowned thee free none dare As yet to rouse thy Lion from its lare Threats have assailed thee but as like the wind They roared &amp; into nothing rage resigned &amp; they may roar &amp; bluster but in vain So barks the Mastiff at his clanking chain Nations in bonds can never cope with thee For they alone are mighty who are free &amp; mayst thou ever be the same as now With victorys laurels blooming on thy brow That scource from which thy every glory springs A land of liberty as well as kings Thus village politics—&amp; hopes for pelf Live in one word &amp; centre all in ‘self’ Thus village politicians urge repairs &amp; deem all governments as wrong but theirs Cants juggling wisdom spurning reasons rules The reasoning jargon of unreasoning fools Versd in low cunning which to handle brief Is but a genteel title for a thief Nay start not reader such harsh words to hear Nor deem the pen of Satire too severe What is that shuffling shadow of a man Were selfs deceptions shine in every plan Who spouts of freedom as the thing he craves &amp; treats the poor oer whom he rules as slaves Who votes equallity that all may share &amp; stints the pauper of his parish fare Who damns all taxes both of church &amp; state &amp; on the parish lays a double rate Such is our heroe in his tyrant pride Then is his honours title misapplied Such with one breath scoff at the poors distress &amp; bawl out freedom for their own redress True Patriotism is a thing divine &amp; far above a theme so mean as mine To higher powers due praises may belong But patriotism is above my song Not that which tells its emptiness aloud Like quacks &amp; pedlars to a gaping crowd That pleads foul robbery in an honest stile &amp; feeds poor hope on honied words the while That deems it honour urgd in knaverys cause &amp; highest merit to evade the laws With words of peace &amp; plenty thickly sown Deceptions aimd at ignorance alone Empty as frothing bubbles on the stream Or shadowy banquets in a beggars dream Ruins the mark the motly monster bears &amp; vile hypocrisy the mask it wears Cant as high priest around its alter prays &amp; preaches loud its mockery of praise Oer blinded minds its poison quickly runs But shrinks in mist from reasons searching suns To those gilt Dagons knaves &amp; fools may raise Deceptions alters of decieving praise &amp; paint their claims as interest wills to paint Call each a god a devil or a saint Truth will his godships mighty claims betray &amp; prove like Daniel that hes made of clay These soft politic saints may freedom preach &amp; vacant minds believe the lies they teach Who think them walking canaans flowing oer With milk &amp; honey for the starving poor &amp; sure enough their wants may richly fare If like camelions they can feed on air Their promises sown thick degenerate run &amp; mildew into broken ones when done &amp; tho a plentious seed time dreams of gains A blighted harvest falsifys the pains Such promises to day to morrow straight Like an old almanack is out of date &amp; they who break them no more credit breaks Then Moors new year does for the olds mistakes Thus freedom preaching is but knaverys game &amp; old self interest by a different name But they alone are worthy of its claims Who midst the storm that sanctions or defames Firm like the Oak on their first ground sojourn Neath suns &amp; winds that shines &amp; shocks in turn Who fear no scoffs nor hunt the cloak of bribes Those smiling tempters of declaiming scribes Meteors that dazzle with a vapours flame That rise in gilded praise &amp; set in shame Tho barren vineyards patriots labour in Their countrys good is all they strive to win Tho rough the road they struggle to the last &amp; look with joy upon the journey past Their very faults are blessings misapplied ‘&amp; een their failings lean to virtues side’ Tho crowds be found to scorn &amp; few to raise The ‘still small’ anthem of deserving praise Yet consience triumphs like a setting sun &amp; self illumined feels its best was done For men like these the heathens praise did claim Seats with the Gods &amp; gave their deeds the name &amp; still for such fame pulls from freedoms tree A bough that blossoms with posterity &amp; twines like Ivy gathering strength with time Green round the ruins of their native clime &amp; such art thou—but why should I proclaim Thy worth that hideth from the gaze of fame &amp; in the conscience of a noble cause Shrinks like a hermit from the worlds applause Yet worth like thine a share of fame shall meet That falls like sunshine on thy calm retreat That fame that found the Roman at his plough Follows thy footsteps &amp; applauds thee now &amp; little need hath verse of mine to tell Of one respected &amp; beloved so well &amp; lest my humble muse unused to shine Shoud with presumptive theme dishonour thee I'll leave thy name to wortheir songs then mine &amp; pledge this offering to thy memory Titles &amp; power &amp; riches &amp; estate All at thy birth conspired to make thee great But these are baubles which distinction breeds &amp; are as shadows to thy noble deeds Pomp is an insect that but makes display For one poor season &amp; so fades away Tho flattery fawns by wealth &amp; titles moved True worth alone can make the man beloved &amp; worth is thine that through thy life hath won The praise of many &amp; the scorn of none For foes grow silent when they hear thy name &amp; sanction praises were they cannot blame For thy whole life hath sought one common end The slave to free the feeble to befriend No pompous speeches which ambition vents Made thy name popular in parliments No court intrigues a fawning hope to raise Gilt thy first entrance with newspaper praise— Mans general welfare &amp; thy countrys good Deeds on which honours noblest base hath stood Were the first struggles of thy patriotic skill &amp; wears through life thy whole ambition still Labouring along in each unshining part With simple truth &amp; such an upright heart That when the poor hear thee their rights defend They feel thee more their brother then their friend &amp; in such hearts thy name so good &amp; just Shall live behind &amp; ‘blossom in the dust’ &amp; may thy names successors ever be Branches proved worthy of their parent tree To bloom unblighted on a glorious race Shineing unsullied on the page of fame &amp; like the sunrise on an ancient place Gild the past memory of thy worthy name Names without worth may be by beggars bought Shadows of nothings that are less then naught These will grow old like garments time will tear Poor honours tinsel &amp; make worse for wear The proudest trials to prolong their date When scut[c]heond pride turns rags &amp; mocks in state Aye marble bye &amp; bye with sculpture deckt Shall mingle with the ashes they protect Brass eat its self away in fretting rust &amp; names on adamant shall fret to dust Worth &amp; worth only has the longest run &amp; virtue graves it on the golden sun Eternitys escutcheon there it shines With every day renewed which nothing lines Piering its influence on the happy day While bad ones moulder in the night away What is mere honour that so charms the sight A bauble gilt a shadow cloathed in light A pompous nothing pride extolleth high A boast of blood that runs its channels dry To stagnate upon common shores at last Honour in state what is the Farce when past A veil death sends exposing tyrant knaves To eke the refuse of ignoble graves Honour in war the cannon vaunts so loud What but poor insect weaving its own shroud A danger where the bravest dare &amp; die For the cold praise that marble tombs supply &amp; such is honours all in every game Like faithless friend she soon forgets their fame &amp; as a laccquey unto shame will turn With littleness &amp; meaness to sojourn So what was Pompeys Cesars in the past Race horses dogs &amp; coaches heir at last Mere titles without worth are withered bays &amp; paper crowns that mock at honours rays The meanest tradesman in his flash attire Struts from behind his counter an Esq? Een knighthood from its throne is hurled afar &amp; fortune caught for clowns the fallen star What honour wore times past Sir Ralph wears now Whose feats of prowess sprung from flail &amp; plough Whose grandame spun &amp; darned the cloaths she wore &amp; robed the dung hill to increase her store Thus sprang the means that feed his present fame &amp; silver stars gild oer his little name &amp; just as much of honours light they leave As pewter crests upon a paupers sleeve The little odds thats hardly worth the name Lie in the metal for the mans the same While a good name however poor or small Grows great in value &amp; outshines them all A shadow man between the two extreams Of fat &amp; lean like pharoahs hungry dreams With visage such as frighted childern dread When gossip stories haunt their dreams abed In heart &amp; head vain ignorant &amp; dull &amp; fierce in visage as a baited bull Appears the village constable who bears The affairs of state &amp; keeps them in repairs Foremost in meetings he resumes his place &amp; gives opinions upon every case Reigning &amp; ruling in the mighty state A jackall makeshift for a majistrate Keeping the tools of terror for each cause When the starved poor oerstep his pigmy laws To mark the paupers goods the parish brand Is in his mansion ready at command Titles around his name their honours bring Like rags &amp; tatters round the ‘beggars king’ Churchwardens Constables &amp; Overseers Makes up the round of Commons &amp; of Peers With learning just enough to sign a name &amp; skill sufficient parish rates to frame &amp; cunning deep enough the poor to cheat This learned body for debatings meet Tho many heads the parliment prepare &amp; each one claims some wisdom for its share Like midnight with her vapours tis so small They make but darkness visible withall Their secretary is the Parish Clerk Whom like a shepherds dog they keep to bark &amp; gather rates &amp; when the next are due To cry them oer at church time from his pew He as their ‘Jack of all trades’ steady shines Thro thick &amp; thin to sanction their designs Who apes the part of King &amp; Magistrate &amp; acts grand segnior of this turkish state Who votes new laws to those already made &amp; acts by force when one is disobeyd Having no credit which he fears to loose He does what ever dirty jobs they chuse Knight of the black staff master of the stocks &amp; hand cuff keeper—tools that sadly mock His dignity—for common sense will sneer &amp; half acknowledge in his passing ear That such like tools &amp; titles near was known To grace a name so aptly as his own For though with natural cunning fortified His deeds will often grow too large to hide Tho' like a smugglers dealings shunning light They peep thro' rents &amp; often sprout in sight Thus summons oft are served in hopes of pelf To overcharge &amp; get a fee for self &amp; village dances watched at midnight hours In the mock errand of his ruleing powers With feigned pretence good order to preserve Only to break it if a chance shoud serve For married clowns his actions closely mark &amp; jealous grow at whispers in the dark Whence broils ensue—then from the noisey fray Himself hath made sneaks unpercieved away Like to the fox whom yard dogs barks affright When on the point of robbing roosts at night Such is this Sancho of the magistrates &amp; such are most knaves of those petty states Where cunning fools are only reckoned wise Who best can hide their faults from others eyes &amp; bold assurance forging merits place Takes credit to be bad were all are base Whose Staff becomes his law &amp; succour too The stoutest village rabble to subdue Soon as he holds it in his mighty hand It grows as potent as a magic wand Clowns look &amp; grow submissive at the view As if the mighty weapon froze them thro For when a Hudibrass oersteps the laws A Ralph is ready to defend his cause Tasking the pauper [his] labours to stand Or clapping on his goods the Parish Brand Lest he should sell them for the want of bread On parish bounty rather pind then fed Or carrying the parish book from door to door Claiming fresh taxes from the needy poor &amp; if ones hunger overcomes his hate &amp; buys a loaf with what shoud pay the rate He instant sets his tyrant laws to work In heart &amp; deed the essence of a turk Brings summons for an eighteen penny rate &amp; gains the praises of the parish state Or seizes goods &amp; from the burthend clown Extorts for extra trouble half a Crown Himself a beggar that may shortly take A weekly pittance from the rates they make But the old proverb suits the subject well Mount such on horseback &amp; theyll ride to hell Such is this fussy cur that well deserves The business of the master whom he serves The vilest thing neer crawled without its brother &amp; theyre as like as one Ass gets another One sets no job but tother barks to do't Both for self interest lick the foulest foot &amp; spite of all the meaness &amp; the stink Picks up gains crumbles from the dirtiest sink One name serves both &amp; that I need not name For all may by the color know the game As hungry dogs know carrion by the smell So all may know them by their ways as well Coarse as such images but nought would do But coarsest stuff to make the picture true As when some muse weeps over Tyburn tree Hard words &amp; hanging make the melody So as they reign here let them hang together Stinking when met like sinks in stormy weather Tho natures marks are deep that all may scan A knaves delusions from an honest man Oppression often mourns the vile abuse &amp; flyes to justice—deemd of little use Truth that coud once its own redresses seek Is now deemd nothing &amp; forbid to speak Driven like an exild king from past renown Power took its place &amp; keeps it with a frown But tis well known that justice winks at crimes A saying thats in season at all times Or why should the poor sinning starving clown Meet jail &amp; hanging for a stolen crown While wealthy thieves with knaverys bribes endued Plunder their millions &amp; are not pursued Nay at the foot of Tyburns noted tree They do deserving deeds &amp; still go free Where others suffer for some pigmy cause They all but murder &amp; escape the laws Skulking awhile in briberys dirty den Then start new gilt &amp; pass as honest men &amp; why shoud power or pride betray its trust Is it too old a fashion to be just Or does self interest inclinations bend Aye Aye the Farmer is his worships friend As parish priest from him he meets his tythes Punctual as harvest wakes the tinkling sythes Tho often grudgd yet he their hopes to glad Prays better harvests when the last was bad &amp; as he deals so honestly with him It must be malice in the poor or whim Who seek relief &amp; lay on them the blame &amp; hopless seek it &amp; return the same Within the church where they on sabbath days Mock god with all the outward show of praise Making his house a pharisees at best Gods for one day &amp; Satans all the rest The parson oft scarce puts his sermon bye Ere neath his pulpit &amp; with mighty cry The clerk anounces—what?—commandments meet No—when these parish vestrys next shall meet To fleece the poor &amp; rob with vile command Want of its bread too feeble to withstand Altho its aching heart too often knows Knaves call it debtor where it nothing owes For in these Vestrys cunning deep as night Plans deeds that would be treason to the light &amp; tho so honest in its own disguise Twould be plain theft exposed to reasons eyes For the whole set just as they please can plan And what one says all sanction to a man Self interest rules each vestry they may call &amp; what one sticks for is the gain of all The set—thus knavery like contagion runs &amp; thus the fathers card becomes the sons Both play one game to cheat us in the lump &amp; the sons turn up shows the fathers trump Here shines the man of morals Farmer Finch Smooth tongued &amp; fine an angel every inch In outward guise &amp; never known as yet To run in Taverns Brothels or in debt In public life all punctual honest true &amp; flattery gives his graces double due For pitys gifts are never public made But there his name &amp; guinea is displayed In double views to answer prides desire To purchase praise &amp; to be dubbed Esquire A sunday never comes or foul or fair That misses him at church throughout the year The priest himself boasts as the mans reward That he near preached a sermon but he heard Such is the man in public all agree That saints themselves no better men could be But now of private life lets take the view —In that same church &amp; in that very pew Where he each sabbath sings &amp; reads &amp; prays He joins the vestry upon common days Cheating the poor with leveys doubly laid On their small means that wealth may be defrayed To save his own &amp; others his compeers He wrongs the poor whom he has wrongd for years Making the house of prayer the house of sin &amp; placing Satan as high priest within Such is this good church going morral man This man of morrals on deseptions plan So knaves by cant steer free from sins complaints &amp; flatterys cunning coins them into saints Tho justice Terror who the peace preserves Meets more of slander then his deeds deserves A blunt opinionated odd rude man Severe &amp; selfish in his every plan Or right or wrong his overreasoning heart Believes &amp; often overacts his part Tho pleading want oft meets with harsh replies &amp; truths too often listend too as lies Altho he reigns with much caprice &amp; whim The poor can name worse governers then him His gifts at Christmass time are yearly given No doubt as toll fees on the road to heaven Tho charity or looses byt or wins Tis said to hide a multitude of sins &amp; wether wealth-bought-hopes shall fail or speed The poor are blest &amp; goodness marks the deed Tho rather leaning to the stronger side He preaches often on the sins of pride &amp; oft while urging on the crimes of dress His looks will tell the jealous were to guess Vain offering mercys plea in hopes to cure How wasted pride might feed the wanting poor &amp; wether just or not his own whole plan Sets the example as a plain drest man His three cockt hat &amp; suit in colour met Were youths first fashion &amp; he sticks it yet The same spruce figure traced in memorys back Een strangers know him as ‘the man in black’ While playing boys on sundays without guess Will scent their foe a furlong by his dress Tho to complaints his aid is oft denyd Tho said too oft to shun the weaker side Yet when foul wrongs are utterd in his ear Farmers themselves meet reprimands severe Poor trembling maids too learn his looks to dread By sad forcd errands to his mansion led His worships lectures are so long &amp; keen Theyre dreaded now as pennance once has been Tho it is said what will not rumour say There een was seasons when the priest was gay That now &amp; then in manhoods lusty morn His maids turnd mothers &amp; were never sworn Yet still he reigns what ever faults they find A blunt odd rude good picture of his kind Who preaches partial for both church &amp; king &amp; runs reform down as a dangerous thing &amp; oft like hells its mystic deeds unravels &amp; dreads it name as children dread the d?ls Yet mixes often in election dinners &amp; takes his seat ‘with publicans &amp; sinners’ Drinks healths &amp; argues wether wrong or right Nor ever flinches to be deemd polite But healths gave out by young reforming sparks He drinks in silence &amp; disdains remarks Or puts the profferd wine untasted bye &amp; waits some wiser speech to make reply Anothers faults with him are quickly known Yet needs a micriscope to find his own He deems all wrong but him unless they be Of the same cloth &amp; think the same as he Thus self triumphant both in light &amp; dark He oft leaves reason &amp; oer shoots the mark &amp; while he deems reform a knave &amp; cheet Extreams in both as equals nearly meet For he who gains on reasons race the start &amp; good or bad thus overacts his part Is quite as radical in reasons cause As he who trys to trample oer the laws What ever cause he banters or defends Enthuseism baffles not befriends The wild mad clamours that its votarys raise Urge those to ridicule who meant to praise &amp; hurts religion tho it wears a gown As bad as deists who woud pull it down &amp; thus his reverence often sinks in faults &amp; dashes on &amp; never own[s] nor halts Ranters &amp; Methodists his open foes In person &amp; in sermons hell oppose With superstition hell brook no pretense &amp; deems them catholics in all but sense They in their turn oppose the urgd remark &amp; deem his worship grovling in the dark Sifts the opinions which he puts in force &amp; strives to wreck him with his own discourse Deeming the plan to which his pride doth cling ‘That little learning is a dangerous thing’ From whence reformd opinionists proceed That near had been had they not learnd to read They prove such plans in arguments at length A very pope in every thing but strength &amp; tho the cobler priest lacks no consiet His worship tires him &amp; will not be beat When the old snob despairing not resignd Sighs while he sneers &amp; pitys one so blind Still with each rude assault he preseveres Nor heeds the Coblers cant nor cares nor fears &amp; now &amp; then his sermons length prolongs To guard his flock against decietful tongues &amp; takes much trouble on a sabbath day To lecture drunkards &amp; drive boys from play &amp; tho from year to year unknown to use To keep his peace &amp; sunday from abuse Beside the circling cross upon the hill The dancing Stocks maintain their station still &amp; as derision &amp; decaying time Weaken their trumph oer abuse &amp; crime The priest still mindfull of his ruling cares Renews their reign in threatning repairs Laws or religion or be what they will Self will not yield but stickles to it still &amp; still he rules in every baffling plan The same head strong opinionated man But now grown old in reading sundays prayers &amp; keeping village morals in repairs Till een his very spectacles refuse To see the largest print that age can chuse He seeks a curate to supply his place A kinsman of his worships sacred race Who ages back sought priesthoods place to teach The only spot were bankrupts cannot reach &amp; meeting riches in prosperity Still chuse a scion from the family To graft upon religions fruitful stock Were blights near come ambitions hopes to mock That bends with fruit when ere they like to pull &amp; bears all seasons &amp; is ever full So this young kinsman of his worships troop That like to Levi keeps the charter up Now fills with mighty lungs the plenteous place Whose love of gain makes up for want of grace Who wears his priesthood with a traders skill &amp; makes religion learn to make her bill Who ere he cures his sheep of their disease Like lawyers studys oer the churches fees Who ekes new claims on customs ancient price When reason ruled &amp; priests were not so nice &amp; sets on registers his raising mark That used to fetch their sixpence to the clerk &amp; from the age enquiring staring clown Extorts the monstrous charge of half a crown &amp; if a wanderer leaves his wants to roam &amp; dies on other ills he meets from home His church yard common for a bed is lost &amp; forfeits must be paid by double cost &amp; his jack all the clerk in double sense Who sings his sunday task &amp; counts his pence Hies to his post instructed in his trade To claim the fees before the grave is made &amp; marriage pays its earnest for a bride Offering her fees before the knott is tyd &amp; new made mothers that with thanks repairs Seek gods kind love but pays the priest for prayers With him self interest has a face of brass A shameless tyrant that no claims surpass Who shrinks at nothing &amp; woud not disdain To take a farthing in the ways of gain Or less what ere his claims &amp; fees enjoin If such a fraction was a current coin Such is the substitute put on to keep The close shorn remnant of his worships sheep &amp; bye &amp; bye hopes at his friends decay To be sole shepherd &amp; recieve full pay &amp; is religion grown so commonplace To place self interest foremost in the race &amp; leave poor souls in Satans claws confind Crawling like crabs a careless pace behind Excuse the priest he's prest with weighty cares &amp; tho the pauper dyes without his prayers What if such worthless sheep slip into hell For want of prayers before the passing bell The priest was absent twas a daily song Yet none except the vulgar thought it wrong Perhaps when death beds might his aid desire His horse was sick &amp; might a drink require Or friends for just nessesitys might claim His shooting skill to track the fields for game &amp; when they needed patridges or hares The parish pauper coud not look for prayers Or if he did indulge the foolish whim What cared the priest—dye &amp; be d?d for him &amp; he had land to shepherd where the wheat In a sly way the churches profit beat Tho he kept one to manage of his kin Yet self was foreman when the gain dropt in &amp; dwells no memorys in the days gone bye No names whose loss is worth a present sigh Yes—there was one who priesthoods trade profest ‘One whom the wretched &amp; the poor knew best’ &amp; in yon house that neighbours near the show Of parish huts a mellancholy row That like to them a stubble covering wears Decayd the same &amp; needing like repairs Superior only was the mansion known Instead of mud by having walls of stone There lived the Vicar once in days gone bye When pride &amp; fashion did not rank so high Ere poor religion threw her weeds away To mix in circles of the worldly gay Ere hunting Parsons in the chace begun &amp; added salarys kept their dog &amp; gun To claim &amp; trespass upon ground not theirs The game for shooting well as tythe for prayers Ere sheep was driven from the shepherds door &amp; pleasure swallowed what might feed the poor In that same time whose loss was keenly felt The good old Vicar in this mansion dwelt Plain as the flock dependant on his cares Their week day comforts &amp; their sunday prayers Hed no spare wealth to follow fashions whim &amp; if he had she'd little joys for him He kept no horse the hunting sports to share He fed no dogs to run the harmless hare Hed nought to waste while hunger sought his shed &amp; while he had it they near wanted bread His chiefest pleasure charity possest In having means to make another blest Little was his &amp; little was required Coud he do that twas all the wealth desired Tho small the gift twas gave with greatest will &amp; blessings oer it made it greater still On wants sad tale he never closed his door He gave them somthing &amp; he wishd it more To all alike compassions hand was dealt &amp; every gift tho small was deeply felt The beggars heart dismantled of its fears Leapd up &amp; thankd him for his crust with tears &amp; ownd was worth rewarded as it ought Hed claims to thousands were hed but a groat Muttering their blessing as they turnd to part Wishing his purse an equal to his heart Ah weres the heart so hardend at its core Or eye so dead on what it pauses oer That times sad changes fail to be severe That sees his havoc &amp; near drops a tear The Vicars greensward pathways once his pride His woodbine bowers that used his doors to hide &amp; he himself full often in his chair Smoaking his pipe &amp; conning sermons there The yard &amp; garden roods his only farms &amp; all his stock the hive bees yearly swarms Are swept away—their produce &amp; their pride Were doomed to perish when the owner dyd Fresh faces came with little taste or care &amp; joyd to ruin what was his to rear His garden plants &amp; blossoms all are fled &amp; docks &amp; nettles blossom in their stead Before the door were pinks &amp; roseys stood The hissing goose protects her summer brood &amp; noisey hogs are free to wallow oer The corner seat were weary hinds had rest The snug fire side that welcomd many a guest Not fashions votarys these disdaind his door But plain old farmers &amp; the neighbouring poor The one in harmless leisure to regale To crack his wallnutts &amp; to taste his ale With miserys humble plea the other led To tell his sorrows &amp; to share his bread These are decayed as comforts will decay As winters sunshine or as flowers in may These all are past as joys are born to pass Were lifes a shadow &amp; were flesh is grass Een memorys lingering features time shall rot &amp; this good man is nearly now forgot Save on his tomb &amp; some few hearts beside Greyheaded now left childern when he dyd Who from their parents all his goodness knew &amp; learnd to feel it as they older grew When he was vanishd &amp; the world was known &amp; troubles evil days became their own Then woud they talk in sorrows gushing joys Of the good priest that preached when they were boys &amp; shake their heads &amp; wish such godly men &amp; good old times woud come about agen Full well may they regret the seasons gone Such happy times that pride hath trampld on Well may the past warm in the peasants praise &amp; dwell with memory as the golden days When the old vicar with his village dwelt Ere prides curst whimseys was so deeply felt When farmers used their servants toils to share &amp; went on foot to market &amp; to fair Not like the present petty ruling things Disdaining ploughs from whence their living springs &amp; looking high among their betters now Claim with the parson labours passing bow Ere titled homage wore no vulgar names Nor made a mockery to pretending claims Yon cot when in its glory &amp; its pride Maintaind its priest &amp; half the poor beside These were the times that plainess must regret These were the times that labour feels as yet Ere mockd improvments plans enclosed the moor &amp; farmers built a workhouse for the poor &amp; vainly feels them &amp; as vainly mourns As no hopes live betokening like returns The cottage now with neither lawn or park Instead of Vicar keeps the vicars clerk Wolves may devour oppressions fiends may reign Nones nigh to listen when the poor complain Too high religion looks her flocks to watch Or stoop from pride to dwell in cots of thatch Scenes too important constant business brings That lends no time to look on humbler things Too much of pleasure in her mansion dwells To hear the troubles which the pauper tells To turn a look on sorrows thorny ways Like good samaritans of former days To heal in mercy when foul wrongs pursue &amp; weep oer anguish as she once woud do Distress may languish &amp; distress may dye Theres none that hears can help them when they cry Compassion cannot stoop nor pride alow ‘To pass that way’ with oil or honey now Still there are some whose actions merit praise The lingering breathings of departed days Tho in this world of vainess thinly sown Yet there are some whom fashion leaves alone Who like their master plain &amp; humble go &amp; strive to follow in his steps below Who in the Wilderness as beacons stand To pilgrims journeying to the promised land To give instructions to enquiring souls &amp; cheer the weak above the worlds controuls To tend their charge &amp; wanderers back restore To rest the weary &amp; relieve the poor The past &amp; present always disagree The claims of ruin is what used to be Old customs usuage daily disappears &amp; wash to nothing in the stream of years The very church yard &amp; its ramping grass &amp; hollow trees remain not as it was Far different scenes its nakedness displays To those familiar with its guardians days Tho holy ground &amp; trees that round it grew Ownd claims sufficient to be holy too Religions humble plea was felt in vain When ruin enterd with the hopes of gain Its weak defence was trampled under foot &amp; all its pride laid level to its root Its awthorn hedges surely sacred things That blushd in blossom to a many springs Its hollow trees that time decayd in tears &amp; left to linger in the blight of years Whose mossy finger scarrd on every grain The trace of days that never come again These old inhabitants are now no more Oppression enterd &amp; their reign was oer Sure shades like these a natural end bespoke Who'd thought their peace was ripening to be broke Till other hearts the vicars place supplyd That preachd a life that practice oft belied Then ancient tenants of a sacred spot They fell like common trees &amp; were forgot Ah sure it was a mellancholly day That calld the good man from his charge away Those poor lorn outcasts born to many cares That shared his table welcome as his prayers To them the bells worse tidings never gave Then that which calld their guardian to the grave To them no prayers so near their bosoms reachd As the sad lecture oer his coffin preachd Theyd no more harvests now of hopes to reap Een children wept to see their mothers weep &amp; pulld their gowns to ask &amp; question when Hed wake &amp; come to give them pence agen ‘Hell not sleep there for ever sure he wont ‘Wholl feed &amp; cloath us if the Vicar dont’ Thus lispd the babes &amp; while their parents sighd Muttering their blessings by the pasture side Warm repetitions of their griefs was given &amp; they hoped too to meet their friend in heaven Beside the charnell wall in humble guise A small stone noteth were the vicar lyes Were age slow journying on the sabbath day Oft potters up to wipe the weeds away &amp; show enquiring youth with mournfull pride That good mans name that once its wants supply'd To hear it read &amp; bring back days to view &amp; feel his goodness &amp; his loss anew Blessing his name &amp; praying as they weep To be full soon companions of his sleep To share with him the churchyards lonely peace Were pride forgets its scorn &amp; troubles cease Were povertys sad reign of cares is oer Nor tells its wants to be denyd no more The last lorn hope &amp; refuge that appears Thro the dull gloom of lifes declining years Shoved as a nusiance from prides scornfull sight In a cold corner stands in wofull plight The shatterd workhouse of the parish poor &amp; towards the north wind opes the creaking door A makeshift shed for misery—no thought Urgd plans for comfort when the work was wrought No garden spot was left dull want to cheer &amp; make the calls for hunger less severe With wholsome herbs that summers might supply Twas not contrived for want to live but dye A forced consern to satisfy the law Built want this covering oer his bed of straw Een that cheap blessing thats so freely given To all that liveth neath the face of heaven The light of day is not alowd to win A smiling passage to the glooms within No window opens on the southern sky A luxury deemd to prides disdainful eye The scant dull light that forcefull need supplyd Scorn frownd &amp; placed them on the sunless side Here dwell the wretched lost to hopless strife Reduced by want to skelletons in life Despised by all een age grown bald &amp; grey Meets scoffs from wanton childern in their play Who laugh at misery by misfortune bred &amp; points scorns finger at the mouldering shed The tottering tennant urges no replye Turns his white head &amp; chokes the passing sigh &amp; seeks his shed &amp; hides his hearts despair For pity lives not as a listner there When no one hears or heeds he wakes to weep On his straw bed as hunger breaks his sleep &amp; thinks oer all his troubles &amp; distress With not one hope that life shall make them less Save silent prayers that every woe may have A speedy ransom in the peaceful grave Close fisted justice tho his only friend Doth but cold comforts to his miserys lend For six days only it alows its fee Pay scarce sufficient for the wants of three &amp; for the seventh which god sent to rest The weary limbs of labouring man &amp; beast He too may pay for what blind justice cares Theyve nought for sunday but the parsons prayers He lived not from his cradle thus forlorn Both friends &amp; kindred blest his early morn But kindred now are vanished all &amp; gone His friends turned foes &amp; thus he lives alone A Farm he rented in his prosperous days &amp; prides mouth never opened but to praise Misfortune crossed his path he tried in vain &amp; sunk like Job but never rose again His kindred pitied but no help supplied His friends were sought but friends their aid denied Kin turned away &amp; left his wants forlorn &amp; prides eye never heeded but to scorn To him the whole wide world contained no friend His griefs to sooth his weakness to defend Look where he may all he possessed is fled &amp; he himself tho living seems as dead Old Farmer Thrifty reigns from year to year Their tyrant king yclypd an overseer A sad proud knave who bye a cunning plan Blindfolds his faults &amp; seems an honest man He rarely banters when he buys or sells But sets a price &amp; there his honour dwells He rails at cheating knaves for knaverys sake &amp; near asks double what he means to take Shuns open ways which lesser rogues pursue An outside christian but at heart a Jew Each smooth deciet his blackend heart belies &amp; consience blushes thro the thin disguise He seems so honest so says Farmer Slye That even childern may his bargains buy &amp; pays all debts too with a feignd good will &amp; rarely frowns to read a trades mans bill While those deemd moderate charges rarely fail To buy a welcome &amp; to taste his ale Upright &amp; punctual every bargains made A very quaker in affairs of trade He preaches down the faults in neighbours known Scorns other roguery just to hide his own Thus he mocks honour on deceptions creed But let us read the riddle in the deed Tho wealth nor makes nor want bemeans the man With nought but luck the world &amp; he began Old men will tell you when the boy was small How he blackd shoes &amp; waited at the Hall But natural cunning shone in early youth &amp; flatterys tongue which pride mistook for truth Raisd by degrees the youngster into fame &amp; blotchd fates stigma from his little name Gilding like blemished fruit his failings oer Thats fair without &amp; rotten at the core Thro all the names that wait on wealth &amp; pride From shoe black vile to valet dignified He rose successively without a fall &amp; ownd the cunning power to please in all &amp; as the serpent yearly changed his skin Some old face fled to take the youngster in At length power blessd him with its highest stretch Which good mens merits might despair to reach No longer doomd in servitude to wait Next to the squire he managed his estate Yclypd a Steward—strangers made their bow &amp; the squire took him as an equal now While to neglect his former steward fell For no one crime unless twas acting well &amp; soon the tyrant threw the mask aside When wealth throngd in &amp; power was gratified Soon cloakd deciet that placed its owner there To grasp at riches threw its visage bare He raisd the rents of all the tennants round &amp; then distrest them as in duty bound &amp; then askd leave of the contented squire To rent the farm &amp; had his hearts desire The storm at first must burst upon the poor That urgd wants curses as they passd his door The humble hind that kept his cow before &amp; just kept want from creeping to his door He viewd their comforts with a jealous heart &amp; raised their rents &amp; bade their hopes depart Yet loath to leave—their cows was sold for rent &amp; the next year left nothing but complaint Twas just as wished his plans was quickly known Each spot was seized &amp; added to his own Others resignd &amp; the half starving poor Laid down their sufferings at their masters door Unused to such complaints the easy squire Was rousd to listen pity &amp; enquire The knave still ready up his sleeve to creep Proved all as right &amp; land as still too cheap But friends familiar swore the squire was mad To think of reasoning with a man so bad To see &amp; suffer such uncloakd abuse From one whose plans was shuffle &amp; excuse Such whispers urgd the easy Squire to shift &amp; Steward Thrifty then was turnd adrift But not before his purse was filld with pelf For knaves work quick &amp; near loose sight of self His nest was featherd ere his fame was old &amp; land was bought when farms was cheaply sold He now retires at ease &amp; sells his grain &amp; strives to be an honest rogue in vain With big round belly &amp; sleek double chin He reads the news &amp; smokes &amp; drinks his gin &amp; studys all the week oer gains affairs &amp; once a week at Chappel reads his prayers &amp; seems as striving former deeds to mend Mild to a foe &amp; coaxing to a friend But to the poor his ways are still severe Dwindled in Office to an overseer Still deaf to want that seeks him to be fed He gives them curses in the lieu of bread Or scoffing at their hopes tells them theyre free To seek a law as tyranizd as he Thus want still proves the stewards cankerd heart &amp; wealth beholds him ape ‘the goodly part’ The one in nursing vengance while he starves Is urged to curse him as he still deserves The other blinded by his alterd plan Forgives &amp; takes him as a d?d good man Why art thou, beggars king wants overseer To helpless poverty alone severe On their dependance thou hast fatly fed &amp; can thy niggard hand deny them bread He pleads bad times when justice chides his ways Tho justice self is ill deserving praise &amp; is bad times the cause of such despair Go ask the wretches who inhabit there If past good times their hopes had ever blest &amp; left them thus so wretched &amp; distrest Ask if their griefs can better times recall Their startled tears tell plenty as they fall &amp; pitys heart can easy comprehend That Farmer Thrifty never was their friend Art thou a man thou tyrant oer distress Doubtless thy pride woud scorn to think thee less Then scorn a deed unworthy of that name &amp; live deserving of a better fame Hurt not the poor whom fate forbad to shine Whose lots were cast in meaner ways then thine Infringe not on the comforts they posses Nor bid scant hope turn hopless in distress Drive not poor freedom from its niggard soil Its independance is their staff for toil Take that away which as their right they call &amp; thourt a rogue that beggars them of all They sink in sorrow as a race of slaves &amp; their last hope lives green upon their graves Remember proud aspiring man of earth Prides short distinction is of mortal birth However high thy hated name may be Death in the dust shall humble pride &amp; thee That hand that formd thee &amp; lent pride its day Took equal means to fashion humbler clay One power alike reigns as thy god &amp; theirs Who deaf to pride will listen humbler prayers He as our father with the world began &amp; fashiond man in brotherhood with man &amp; learn thou this proud man tis natures creed Or be thou humbled if thou wilt not heed The kindred bond which our first father gave Proves man thy brother still &amp; not thy slave &amp; pride may bluster in its little life To tyranize with overpowering strife Its turn shall come when proud insulting death Shall bid it humble &amp; demand its breath &amp; cannot these fierce tyrants of vain deeds Dare in their pomp to intercept his speed As well may rushes stiffen in the storm &amp; try to wear the oaks unyielding form As well may feathers float against the stream &amp; shadows grow to substance in a dream Or clouds in tempests struggle to be still As pride to tamper &amp; so baulk his will He meets them in their strength &amp; torn from ease They groan &amp; strive like tempests thro the trees While want from lifes dull shadows glad to run As pride went foremost &amp; claimed all the sun Slips from the bitterness of mortal clay As calm as storms drop on an autumn day Death is the full stop that awaits to tell The period of our earthly chronicle The closing Finis that doth end the rude Essay of life &amp; bids its tales conclude With all its failings in the lowly grave Existance ceases with the all it gave Wealth want joy anguish all do cease &amp; lye More blank then shadows neath the smiling sky Leaving eternity to keep the key Till judgment sets all hopes &amp; terrors free Pride &amp; oppression here all meet their end &amp; find their weakness when too late to mend With noiseless speed as swift as summer light Death slays &amp; keeps his weapons out of sight Here thousands stript of earthly pomp &amp; powers Met death &amp; perished in unlooked for hours Their wealth availed not one in all the tribe Death hath no ears to listen to a bribe The rich fall poor into the grave &amp; there The poor grow rich an equal claim to heir Deaths gloomy mansions owns no hall or throne But all lye equal—Death is lord alone Pomps trickerys in the grave are all forgot &amp; worms &amp; eyless skulls distinguish not The pomp that rotting in prides tomb doth lye From rubbish that fills up the slaves just bye Here tyrants that outbraved their God tho clay &amp; for earths glory threw the heavens away Whose voice of power did like the thunder sere As anger hurried on the heels of fear Ordaining hosts of murders at a breath How silent here doth sleep their rage in death Their feet that trampled freedom to its grave &amp; felt the very earth they trod a slave How quiet here they lye in deaths cold arms Without the power to crush the feeble worms Who spite of all the dreadful strife they made Crept there to conquer &amp; was not afraid The warrior from wars havoc here detered Bows before death lame as a broken sword His power wastes all to nothingness away As showers at night wash out the steps of day Still lives unsung a race of petty knaves Numerous as wasps to sting &amp; torture slaves The meanest of the mean a servile race Who like their betters study to be base Whose dung hill pride grows stiff in dirty state &amp; tho so little apes the little great The Workhouse Keeper as old Thriftys man Transacts the business on the tyrants plan Supplys its tennants with their scanty food &amp; tortures misery for a livlihood Despised &amp; hated by the slaves he wrongs &amp; een too low for satires scourging songs So may they yet sink down more viler things &amp; starve as subjects were they reign as kings Or when on earth their dirty triumph ends May hells obscurity reward its frends A thing all consequence here takes the lead Reigning knight errant oer this dirty breed A Bailiff he &amp; who so great to brag Of law &amp; all its terrors as Bumtagg Fawning a puppy at his masters side &amp; frowning like a wolf on all beside Who fattens beef where sorrow worst appears &amp; feeds on sad misfortunes bitterest tears Such is Bumtagg the bailiff to a hair The worshipper &amp; Demon of despair Who waits &amp; hopes &amp; wishes for success At every nod &amp; signal of distress Happy at heart when storms begin to boil To seek the shipwreck &amp; to share the spoil Brave is this Bumtagg match him if you can For theres none like him living save his man As every animal assists his kind Just so are these in blood &amp; business joined Yet both in different colors hide their art &amp; each as suits his ends transacts his part One keeps the heart bred villian full in sight The other cants &amp; acts the hypocrite Smoothing the deed where law sherks set the gin Like a coy dog to draw misfortune in But both will chuckl[e] oer their prisoner's sighs &amp; are as blest as spiders over flyes Such is Bumtagg whose history I resign As other knaves wait room to stink &amp; shine &amp; as the meanest knave a dog can brag Such is the lurcher that assists Bumtagg Born with the changes time &amp; chance doth bring A shadow reigns yclypd a woodland king Enthrond mid thorns &amp; briars a clownish wight My Lords chief woodman in his titles hight &amp; base &amp; low as is the vulgar knave He in his turn for tyrant finds his slave The bug-bear devil of the boys is he Who once for swine pickt acorns neath the tree &amp; starving terror of the village brood Who gleand their scraps of fuel from the wood When parish charity was vainly tryed Twas their last refuge—which is now denyd Small hurt was done by such intrusions there Claiming the rotten as their harmless share Which might be thought in reasons candid eye As sent by providence for such supplye But turks imperial of the woodland bough Forbid their trespass in such trifles now Threatning the dithering wretch that hence proceeds With jail &amp; whipping for his shamless deeds Well pleased to bid their feeblest hopes decay Driving them empty from the woods away Cheating scant comfort of its pilferd blaze That doubtless warmd him in his beggars days Thus knaves in office love to show their power &amp; unoffending helplessness devour Sure on the weak to give their fury vent Were theres no strength injustice to resent As dogs let loose on harmless flocks at night Such feel no mercy were they fear no bite Here comes one different to mere parish stuff A host of talents met in M? Puff Knowing in all things ignorant of none To him mere genius is but farce &amp; fun While talent drops as from his finger ends He knows all names—the greatest are his friends &amp; tho he never saw your face before Hell jest at wit &amp; run his nonsense oer Familiar stuff so thick your shame assails That even dogs to hear it wag their tails He is so full of wisdom you would swear Hed robbed the tree of knowledge till twas bare &amp; not contented with its store of fruits Had seized the trunk &amp; grubbed it by the roots &amp; as for quoting Puffs the man to quote As if hed read all that was ever wrote Yet like his coat his taste must ape the fashion So Shakspears pages are his greatest passion Nor can a beggar even scrat his head But theres what Shakspears on the matter said To show by trifles how the fool has read Are you a Bard—write prose too—very well Puff deals in all &amp; does in all excell &amp; what he will not boast of having done He casts that crumb of credit at his son Mechanical pursuits to spout &amp; write ‘My son sir’ rivals copper plate out right Themes when a boy at school was never won But foremost tho an infant stood ‘My son’ &amp; so between them knowledge is possest Like Pharoahs kine they swallow all the rest Sir Walter, Byron, as his friends he styles &amp; at your ignorance thumbs his chain &amp; smiles Tho at the top of Fame[s] high towering tree These share the worlds applause—poh so does he If not in print he tells you bye &amp; bye He has a M.S. shall climb as high Do you know half the poets—thats as none He strokes his chin &amp; knows them every one Poet Philosopher Mus[i]cian In fact all fames are bound in his Edition What ere is great Puff is—but nothing small All greatness dwells in Puff &amp; Puff in all If chance ere throws a Poet in his way He worms him in their notice untill they Half think theyve seen the smirking fiend before With so much confidence he tongues them oer But the mere Barber who is daily led To clean his chin &amp; drab his fustian head If he but comes when he with friends hath got He scorns the fellows speech &amp; knows him not Thus all small matters meet a rude rebuff From this self oracle renowned Hal Puff &amp; all thats great he treats as his compeers A downright Ass in every thing but ears Others of this small fry as mean as base May live unknown a pigmy reigning race &amp; sink to hell from whence their knavery came As namless tribes unworthy of a name Left on the dung hill were they reignd to rot Hated while living &amp; when dead forgot Here ends the Song—let jealousy condemn &amp; deep reproofs they merit aimd at them When pride is touchd &amp; evil consience bit Each random throw will seem a lucky hit —If common sense its ears &amp; eyes may trust Each pictures faithful &amp; each censure just So let them rail—the proverbs truth is known ‘Were the cap fits theyll wear it as their own’ Full many knaves sharp satires wounds have met Who live in aqufortis dying yet In burning ink their scarecrow memorys dwell Left to the torture of lifes earthly hell As markd &amp; lasting as the thieves burnt brand Who lives &amp; dies with villian on his hand</field>
