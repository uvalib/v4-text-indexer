      <field name="fulltext">On the DEATH of a SPANIEL, The Favourite of the younger Part of the Family, but a Tyrant to the Cats. Beneath your feet, low in the silent dust, Phillis, the fondest cur that ever breath'd, Freed from the cares of life's important trust, Insensible to praise or blame, does rest: But all of canine race must surely die; The bull-dog fierce, the mastiff stout and bold; Each pointer, setter, greyhound, low must lie At last, like spaniel Phillis, stiff and cold. Lions and tigers, all the prowling brood Of bears and wolves, and panthers fierce and wild, That range the desert, and infest the wood, Must yield to death, like Phillis tame and mild. Nay, even the prouder son of human sire, Who stiles himself o'er all creation lord, Must feel the mortal pang, must too expire, And to the wormy grave a feast afford.— Ah, childhood! stop, and shed one generous tear O'er your once fav'rite Phillis, now no more; For she to all your youthful train was dear, When in your service her frail life she wore. Alas! she lies bereft of pow'r to please! All, all her late diverting tricks are done! Phillis no more the grim-fac'd cat can teaze, For ah! the little wanton's dead and gone! WANTON BETTY. Written at Woolwich, by the Desire of Mr. Richards, Pipe-maker in that Town. In Woolwich town does live a lass, I call her Wanton Betty; For not an epithet beside Would suit her half so pretty. Her shape and features, all must own, Are but of homely form; But still the pert vain thing, in hopes The silly fops to charm, First with a floury rag does rub Her skin, of brown complexion; Next cleans her teeth and scurvy gums, According to direction; Then struts in ancient duds, reform'd To something like the fashion, 'Till some soft shipwright, smitten, owns, Alack! his love-sick passion. On Sunday in the gallery's front The graceless girl sits grinning, Nor shortens by one single prayer Her weekly score of sinning. Her heart's of all devotion void, Her wicked eyes are leering, Her mind is too reverse employ'd T'attend to what she's hearing. With blink, or nod, or awkward smile, She views each smart young fellow; Why, wench! of all thy wanton ways I'm quite asham'd to tell-o! Do, prithee, stop thy mad career, The broad way thou'rt a-going; From me, thy friend, to lack advice Think not thyself too knowing. Alas! advice is thrown away On headstrong wanton Bett; Her mad career she still pursues; 'Tis all in vain to fret. So, Wanton Bet, with thee I've done; If this cap fits thee, wear it: I've seam'd it well, and sew'd it strong, Thou canst not fairly tear it. The KING of HANGING WOOD: OR, THE FORTUNE of an IRISH LABOURER, Who was caught with one of the Women that infest Hanging Wood, near Woolwich; whose acknowledged Superiority in fighting had obtained her the Title of Queen of the Wood. Written by Desire of Mr. M?, Foreman of the Bricklayers with whom the Labourer worked. From Ireland came a hearty Boy, Jack Donakin by name: Ahoo! he was as dear a joy As ever shone in fame. In Ireland Jack for bread fed hogs, 'Till he his country flew; But ah! he left his native bogs With noble aims in view: For when to have his fortune told, As he himself reports, He to a wizard blind and old Expos'd his moles and warts; He learn'd on one auspicious wart To plume ambition's wing; “For lo!” said he, “thou'lt shine at court, “And live to be a king: “And Britain's island is the place, “Boy! think it not a notion, “Where thou shalt bear the pond'rous mace, “And climb to such promotion.” Ah! Gramachree, he cried, for joy, I'll make no more delay; So then set off this hearty boy, And left his debts to pay. Long has he borne the promis'd mace The hod., And long has been a-climbing Up the ladder, to earn his daily bread., And oft the court Literally, being several times summoned, for small debts, at Woolwich. has seen his face, As sure as I'm a-rhiming. But lately with the harlot Queen Of amorous Hanging Wood, Th'ambitious rip has made (I ween) The grand prediction good. And may his royal fortune smile 'Till fate in hemp arrays him, And in a proper kingly style To his last court conveys him: For, certain as he first drew breath In that dear isle Hibernia, The rogue will live to catch his death At that place call'd Tyburnia. THE AFFRIGHTED BRICKLAYER. You that in characters delight, Behold, here's one in black and white, Descriptive of a surly rip, As ever did a Bridewell keep. Ill-nature's pictur'd in his face; His looks betray him void of grace; While every word he does dispense Proclaims him likewise void of sense. I wave his sirname; but for that, He answers to the name of Nat, And is by trade a brother Bat. Now be it known, about the time As daisies 'gan to be in prime— But first, to set the matter clear, As well as when, I'll tell you where.— From Woolwich, somewhat 'bout a mile, The thief has liv'd a tightish while, And, 'twixt the town and Shooter's Hill (Now, pray, be quiet while I tell) A range of building if you see, You somewhat near the mark may be Where Nat got into foul disgrace. Per'dy! 'twas in the very place Where Mosely's voice has oft been heard, By which 'tis known the crows were scar'd: For while his foremanship was there, The devil a one would come a-near. Now on the scaffold Nathan stood, One busy day, in angry mood, With trowel brandish'd in his hand, Roaring for stuff with stern command. Whether his hen had peck'd him more Than she was us'd to do before, Or what, we don't pretend to say; But certain 'tis, upon that day Nathan was more than common cross, With clouded brows and look morose: For bricks and mortar how he bawl'd! And louder still and louder call'd. By ev'ry hodman still neglected, 'Twas thought he'd surely go distracted. At length, “You Irish thieves!” he cries, And then went on with d?n your e?, And such-like language; which, to hear, No true-born Irishman could bear. A fierce Hibernian left the ground, With limbs, and lungs, and all things sound; He up the wooden hill ascended, And Natty's noise was quickly ended. “Arrah! now burn my shoul,” says he, “But off the scaffold you shall be: “Not down the ladder; but, for fun, “I'll take and shend you by the run, “If ever an angry word you speak; “So be the hust! and shave your neck, “And put an end to all your swearing, “Or I'll beshtow you out of hearing. “Hurroo! d'ye growl? the devil skin me “If I don't ram you down the chimney.” Cold shiv'ring seiz'd on tim'rous Nat; His very heart went pit-a-pat; Pale as a clout his visage grew; And well it might; for well he knew, If he should send him that way down, 'Twould surely crack his empty crown. Nor spoke his brother Bats a word; The scoundrel was by all abhorr'd: But what, you'll say, was quite uncivil, His greatest friend, I mean the devil, Stood by, and never took his part, And that quite put him out of heart: So Nat thought best to drop the cause, And very wisely clos'd his jaws. The LIFE of J. P. The NETTLEBED-LAMITE. A conceited young Bricklayer, a Native of Nettlebed, in Oxfordshire, who used to boast of his Skill in hedging, ditching, boxing, &amp;c. &amp;c. as well as in his own business, in which he thought himself too good a Workman to be employed in any Part, except the Front Walls, which are built with a better Sort of Bricks, called Front Stocks. It was begun in consequence of a Dispute; but soon stopped in its Progress by a Treat of Beef-steaks and Porter, with which the Bricklayer thought fit to silence the Labourer's Muse. Oft has the muse presum'd, in numbers great, To sing the various turns of human fate; And ventur'd oft, in solemn verse, to tell How mighty empires rose, and how they fell; Nor left unsung the rape of Sparta's queen, Nor how Achilles lov'd fair Pollexene. Divinities and men, and martial frogs, Alike have grac'd her epics or eclogues. Equal she brings, to interest the mind, The world's proud master, or the humble hind. Th'atchievements of a shoe-black may be told In florid language, and in diction bold: Then shall a hect'ring tradesman's deeds be lost, Whose bringing-up so many crowns has cost? No, thou, my muse, shalt rescue from the jaws Of dark oblivion such a weighty cause. Amidst Oxonian vales, where waving corn Makes farmers purse-proud, and the fields adorn; Lo! in an obscure village, with a name Gross as the stinging weed that bears the same, Young Frontstock was begot, conceiv'd, and born. Thus in a bed of nettles grew a thorn. But soon the father, with paternal joy, Beheld the early genius of the boy To rear with unwrought flint the rustic wall, Though sometimes, like old Jericho's He was one time employed by a gentleman to erect a tower of flint in his garden, which, when about three parts finished, tumbled down while he and the labourer were gone to dinner., they'd fall: Nor was the boy at hedging less expert; Ditching and banking too he'd got by heart; To architecture ev'ry way inclin'd, As mostly suiting with his tow'ring mind; To which th'indulgent parent bound him fast, Though some folks think he ran away at last. A SONG, On the PRINCESS ROYAL. Written about a Year before the last French War. RECITATIVE. I. At Spithead anchor'd lies a noble ship, The Princess Royal nam'd, with ninety guns; She'll sweep the rebel Yankees off the deep, And from their batt'ries make the scoundrels run. II. Come, all ye British seamen that wish to gain applause, And enter in our ship, in your king and country's cause, And we'll give the Yankee-doodles a dowse in the jaws, From on board of the Princess Royal. To the Tune of, On board a Man of War. III. Come, all ye jolly landsmen that love to see good fun, And you'll see how we will make the ragged rascals run, And we'll make them strike their striped flags, or die by our guns, From on board of the Princess Royal. Same Tune. IV. RECITATIVE. Brave Milbank, now on board our ship, commands, Whose name the rebels will have cause to fear; Come, now's the time, while we are wanting hands, So to our jovial rendezvous repair. V. Tune of The Irish Hautboy. And there you'll meet some merry dogs, And all as fat as bacon hogs, Resolv'd the Yankees for to flog; Or else, upon occasion, To sink the fleets of France and Spain: So let them ever dare again To meet our navy on the main, Or brave the British nation. VI. Tune, The Women all tell me I'm false to my Lass. There came a bold fellow from good Staffordshire, And a brazier he was by his trade, you shall hear: I'm come for to enter, he loudly did roar, And he'd thrash the damn'd Yankees, he heartily swore. VII. Tune, Of a noble Race was Shenkin. Then came a valiant Welchman, Hur name was Tom Lewellyn; Says he, hur cannot rest nor sleep, 'Till the Yankees hur was killing. For since they'll not be rul'd By us that did maintain her, We'll make them feel Our fire and steel, And that's the way to gain her. Fal de ral, &amp;c. &amp;c. VIII. Tune, Paddy Whack. An Irishman seconded Mr. Lewellyn, And said, My dear crature, you're all in the right; And, by Jasus! I'll venture my life for a shilling But these here damn'd Yankees I'll sartinly fight. Hubbabu, bubbabu, while I'll be able, Hallalu, fallalu, while it will do; May I never see pradies a-top o' the table, If I have n't the spirit to say as I do. IX. For my part, I'll enter aboard like anodder, An shew'm a bit of an Irish game; For the Yankees are scoundrels, and we are their moders, An if they don't know it we'll tach 'em the same. Hubbabu, bubbabu, while I'll be able, Hallalu, fallalu, while it will do; And the ship to the anchor we'll tie with a cable, And then we'll be taking a bit of a cruise. X. Tune, The De'el take the Wars. Then came a Scotch lad, on purpose to enter; He swore that he'd stay no longer on shore; And 'cause he was a 'prentice, he burnt his indenture: On board the Princess Royal he'd enter, he swore. Not his Moggy's kind embraces, No, nor all her muckle graces; Now sighing, Now crying, Could him restrain; For Jockey did declare He'd not the rebels spare; But with big roaring gun He wou'd make the Yankees run, And his life he would lose, or the victory gain. XI. Tune, The Princess Royal. A Country Dance. Our captain cries, “Well said! my boys; “Our guns shall make a thund'ring noise; “While glory each brave mind enjoys: “My hearts, be stout and loyal. “We'll bring destruction on their fleet, “Or take them all that e'er we meet, “And give them soon a grand defeat; “And then we'll come in triumph home, “With flying flags and beating drums, “On board the Princess Royal.” On the Approach of PEACE. Long the trumpet breath'd alarms; Long the drum had beat to arms: Long has sung the martial muse, Fame supplying hostile news. But now the martial song shall cease; And ev'ry voice shall welcome Peace. Peace! thou lovely virgin! hail! Peace! that loves the rural vale: Peace! that loves to haunt the grove, While the shepherd sings of love. Bid the martial trumpet cease; Vales and groves shall echo, Peace! Peace, that loves to rove serene, Where, with weeping willows green; Where, with reeds and daffodils, Pleasing Melancholy dwells, List'ning to the winding stream, Oft the sylvan poet's theme; While the soft, the gentle breeze, Fragrant breathes, and whispers Peace! Hail! again, sweet virgin, hail! All thy gentle charms unveil. Lo! the nations court thy smile; Then welcome to the British Isle, Where the song of war shall cease, While our voices welcome Peace. See! the Goddess now descends; Hostile nations now are friends: Now her olive-branch she waves, Party flies to midnight caves; Lurking Envy hides her head; Discord seeks th'infernal shade. Wild disorder now shall cease, Hush'd by Harmony to Peace. See where dire Bellona flies! Tracks of gore besmear the skies. Clouds arise, and tempests howl; Lightnings blaze, and thunders roll. But the Fury disappears, And the scene to brightness clears; And, to bid the tumult cease, Fame's loud trumpet sounds to Peace. A SONG, Written for a Club of Convivials, Held weekly at the House of Mr. Bush, the Sign of The Sun, in Christmas-Street, Bristol. Ye souls, who love to quaff the genial stream, Whose wave inspires with mirth and joy supreme, The gift of Ceres, whose maternal hand Spreads the ripe harvest, waving o'er our land; And you who wish to lull your cares with song, Let bus'ness rest, and join the jovial throng, Who, while my muse ascends in lofty rhyme, Spurn earth's dull scenes, and soar with her sublime; Whose flight divine the seats of joy explores, Nor rests till high upon the happy shores, Near St. John's sacred mansion St. John's Church, within a few yards of the house., pleas'd, she finds, Above the Worlds Two public-houses a little lower down the same street, each the sign of the Globe, distinguished by the names of the Old and the New Globes., a mansion to our minds; Where fountains with nectareous liquids flow, And plants of mirth to fruits of friendship grow; Where Sol Alluding to the sign of the house. perpetual sheds his golden rays, And Johnny Bush the rent and licence pays; Who has provided us this ample room, To which at length, I thank my stars, I'm come. Tune, Strephon and his Chlora lying. And our president, right worthy, For my song has knock'd me down: Come, my muse! for once bestir thee; Heav'n avert the critic's frown! But these friendly faces round me, If, probatum est, they smile, Shall dispel what doubts confound me, Prompt my verse, and grace my style. Though shou'd you look one size graver, Ah! my song would soon be done; Or, distrustful of your favour, Timid I should venture on. Tune, The Lass of Patie's Mill. Now some folks like your hunting songs, Some sing about the wars; For some men of the chace are fond, And a few of the field of Mars. While some affect your toping songs, (The votaries of wine) The lover swears your love-sick songs Are the only songs divine. The sailor likes your sea-songs best, In which he'll take some pride; And wonder if he lets you rest 'Till he's sung you a full broadside. The miller sings his mill-clack song; Your party songs for some; The husbandman holds fast his cann, Loud roaring Harvest-home. Tune, Then farewel, my trim-built Wherry. (A little altered.) But our convivial joys my theme is, Though surly cares at distance growl: To drink and smoke, to laugh and sing, our scheme is, While friendship fires each gen'rous soul, While friendship fires each gen'rous soul. Our lips the circling tankard greeting, Our pipes with fragrance charge the air: Success we drink, and ev'ry draught repeating, Or damn the churl, or toast the fair. While thus the social joys are flowing, In ev'ry eye while pleasures beam, While with celestial flame each breast is glowing, The sky-born sons of Jove we seem! Meanwhile the song, in strains harmonious, With Fancy's flights enchants our ears: Now hear the thund'ring chorus roar symphonious, And stun the world, and drown the spheres, And stun the world, and drown the spheres. A SONG, Written for a Club at Bristol, which met at the West India Coffee-House, kept by Mr. Hawkes. I Divine Concordia! from the spheres Return'd to bless the happy few, In this gay circle now appears, And bids us all our joys renew. Her blest harmonious train she brings, With ev'ry soul-elating sound; While Pleasure waves her rosy wings, And Pain and Sorrow quit the ground. CHORUS. Now undisturb'd fair Friendship reigns, What breast but owns her sacred power? While sings the muse in vocal strains, To celebrate the social hour. II See! Hawks supplying all our wants: Our nectar, see! in copious floods: He brings the aromatic plant, And clouds of incense feast the Gods! Now fair Euphrosyne descends, And Mirth and Glee their charms resume, To reinspire us jovial friends, Whilst Chorus rocks the lofty dome! Chorus repeated. III By us the streams of life are quaff'd; Our mirth, our songs, proclaim our joys: The toast renew'd, renew'd the draught, And Comus cries, Encore! my boys! While thus by Jove's high favours crown'd, Our spirits rise, unreach'd by care, We'll swell the heart-felt chorus round, And be as blest as mortals dare. CHORUS. Still undisturb'd fair Friendship reigns, What breast but owns her sacred power? While sings the muse in vocal strains, To celebrate the social hour. A SONG FOR THE BRISTOL SAILING SOCIETY. Tune, Britannia, rule the Waves. I By lofty hills environ'd round, On rocky Avon's happy shores, Bristolia stands; within whose ample bound The loud Severnian billow roars: With sails unreef'd, though threat'ning Boreas raves, Her dauntless heroes ride the waves. II Her name to distant regions known, Where Commerce courts the gentle gales, Each temp'rate, each extremer zone, Each clime receives her welcome sails; With which unreef'd, though threat'ning Boreas raves, Her dauntless heroes ride the waves. III Let Britain's vaunting rivals dare Advance, with bloody flags unfurl'd, Bristolians haste the glorious strife to share; Bristolian deeds amaze the world! As thunder-arm'd (while round Bellona raves) Her dauntless heroes ride the waves. IV At home, her sons, estrang'd from fear, Impatient wait the flowing tide; Then pleas'd between their lofty rocks they steer, And o'er their native billows ride: Each daring soul the threat'ning danger braves; Bristolian heroes love the waves. V Elated by th'increasing gale, Undaunted by the lowring storm, Borne on the surge, the heaving flood we hail, With glorious emulation warm! Each daring soul the threat'ning danger braves; Bristolian heroes love the waves. VI Now dreadless o'er the foaming deep, Though furious blasts impetuous howl, With swelling sails our destin'd course we keep; And still, though mountain billows roll, Each daring soul the threatning danger braves: Bristolian heroes love the waves. VII “My sons adopted!” Neptune cries; “Bristolians, long enroll'd by Fame:” His trident waves, the roaring tempest dies, And Tritons loud the deed proclaim: The Nereids leave their subteraqueous caves, To hail the lovers of the waves. VIII Now back with Avon's tide we steer, By fav'ring breezes gently blown; Boys! three times thrice repeat the naval cheer; The flowing bowl our cruise shall crown: While social joys, unknown to sordid slaves, Succeed the pleasures of the waves. On Mr. CRUGER's Return from America, one of the members for Bristol. Ye sons of freedom, now rejoice In loud exulting strain! The hero of Bristolia's choice, The man who claims the people's voice, Returns, with glory crown'd, again! CHORUS. Iö Pæan! Hail! great Cruger! Iö Pæan! Hail! great Cruger! To welcome thee on shore, Bristolian cannons roar: While we triumphant laurels wear, And consecrate the day, And wave our banners high in air, Our dazzling trophies proudly rear, He comes! Huzza! huzza! huzza! On a Piece of Unwrought Pipe-clay. Rude mass of earth, from which with moiled hands (Compulsive taught) the brittle tubes I form, Oft listless, while my vagrant fancy warm Roves (heedless of necessity's demands) Amid Parnassian bow'rs, or wishful eyes The flight of Genius, while sublime she soars Of moral truth in search, or earth explores, Or sails with Science through the starry skies:— Yet must I own (unsightly clod) thy claim To my attention, for thou art my stead, When grows importunate the voice of need, And in the furnace The kiln. thy last change I speed: Ah! then how eager do I urge the flame, How anxious watch thee mid that glowing fire, That threats my eye-balls Alluding to the ill effects of the fire upon his sight, as mentioned in the last page of the Account of himself. with extinction dire! The Author on his own Situation. Oft, tho' by Poverty's chill hand depress'd, I've felt the charm that warm'd the poet's breast; Oft, at the leisure hour, indulg'd my rage To turn the borrow'd volume's magic page, Where some choice fav'rite of th'inspiring Nine Immortal lives in each immortal line; As oft, by daring Emulation fir'd, Invok'd the muse, and felt myself inspir'd: But ere quick Fancy snatch'd the heav'n-born strain, By Mis'ry seiz'd, I sunk depress'd again. Still lur'd by Hope, my wounded genius tries On sacred Inspiration's wings to rise, Eager to brave the Critic's damning frown; But Fate soon brings the wretched soarer down. Doom'd by diurnal toil and sordid care To rub through life, and earn my scanty fare, What frenzy urges my aspiring soul, That aims among the tuneful spheres to roll? Oft wak'd, as from a dream, from strains divine, By angry dun, I lack th'appeasing coin— It may be, have not wherewithal to dine. Ah! then the heart-felt rhapsody is o'er, And then I vow to court the muse no more: But soon my heart resumes the fond desire; Affections long indulg'd but slow expire. Again the pleasing prospect I review; Again the song descriptive I renew: Again divine Urania's voice I hear, And all the bright empyreal scenes appear. O! would some gen'rous patronising friend My murth'ring woes and dire vexations end; Dismiss each threat'ning dun, each anxious care, And bid me eat and sing, devoid of fear! Loud should my grateful song proclaim his praise, Whose fost'ring hand does friendless genius raise; His kind commands my future themes should name; His friendly counsel guide my flight to fame. HOP-PICKING SONG. BY DESIRE OF THE REV. MR. J?. I Welcome! welcome! season gay, Yielding sweet employment; To the hop-grounds haste away, 'Tis there we find enjoyment. From far and near a chearful crew, With honest hearts and faces, Our yearly visit we renew, All smiling as the Graces. CHORUS. Then come, ye hearty lasses fair, And eke of brown complexion, With mirth and glee to work repair, And drive away dejection. II See the well-supported vines All in order growing; Closely each it's pole entwines, And richly all are blowing. See! to us they bend their heads; Yet, tearing them asunder, We thus relentless them unwed, And all their fragrance plunder. CHORUS. Come, ye hearty, &amp;c. III We to Fate must also bend, Perhaps in youth and beauty: Nor think of Death as less our friend; Like us, he does his duty. Thou! yonder early-wither'd vine, Unripe to earth returning; Our sister's fate Here and there the gatherers meet with a hop-vine that is withered; from which the gentleman desired me to draw a simile, in allusion to the death of one of those lasses, who died since the last season., in youth, like thine; Her kindred yet are mourning. CHORUS. But come, ye hearty, &amp;c. IV Still let experience make us wise; Through life let virtue guide us: Let harmless mirth our spirits rise, Though riches are deny'd us. And we, of innocence possess'd, Will trust no bragging rover; Nor yield, till marriage makes us blest, The pledge we can't recover. CHORUS. But come, ye hearty, &amp;c. V At length, the merry season o'er, Our fragrant labour ending, Success encrease our master's store, Long life and health attend him! So drinks each hearty lass so fair, And each of brown complexion; Then to our homes we all repair, With cause for no dejection. CHORUS. So drinks, &amp;c. repeated. A PRAYER. Amid the ceaseless din of human strife, The groans of entering and departing life; Amid the songs of joy, the wails of woe, That living nature utters here below; Amid the harmony of all the spheres In concert, unenjoy'd by mortal ears; Amid Heav'n's trumpets loud, by angels blown, And lyres of seraphim, around thy throne, O great Supreme! and while their voices join, Proclaiming praise and glory only thine; Presuming more, perhaps, than angels dare, A trembling worm of earth intrudes his prayer. Thou great, eternal, awful, gracious cause Of Nature's being, motion, form, and laws! That gav'st me tastes of pleasure and of pain; That gav'st me passions which alternate reign, And reason, passion's riot to restrain: By whom I first inspir'd this mortal breath; In whom I trust for being after death: Should I enjoy thy first great blessing, health; And should thy providence bestow me wealth, And crown me parent of a num'rous race, Whose virtues should my name and fortune grace: To love, to duty, should my fair adhere; Should ev'ry friend approve himself sincere; Should'st Thou my life reserve to ripest age, And give me all the wisdom of the sage; O! let no cursed avarice my store Withhold from friend distress'd, or from the poor! In love, or friendship, or paternal care, In each enjoyment with the world I share, Through life, O! give this feeling heart to be For ever warm with gratitude to Thee! But should thy wisdom the reverse ordain, And send me pale disease, and life-consuming pain; Should pinching poverty still keep me down, To pine beneath my fellow-mortals' frown; Did I paternal feelings never know, Or should my fruitful loins bring future woe; Should an unfaithful wife dishonour bring; Should slight of fancied friends my bosom wring; Should my weak mind endure the scoff of fame, And Dullness be my substituted name; Should Nature early find herself outworn, And that her earth to earth must soon return, Without a friend to comfort or to mourn— Amidst this gloomy, complicated throng Of sharp afflictions, while I press along Through each or real pain or seeming ill, O give me resignation to thy will! MORNING. To breathe fresh air, and view the sylvan scenes; To taste the various sweets of rural life, The bounteous gifts of Nature, and in part Recall the bliss of man's primeval state, I quit the smoking city's busy strife; Nor with reluctance leave her thronged streets, With all her dazzling pomp, her gay parades; Her magisterial train, in scarlet pride; Her structures beautiful, pil'd high in air; Her crowded theatres, or splendid balls. Now hail! ye ample fields, ye choiry groves, Ye limpid streams, that through the vallies glide; Ye lofty hills, commanding prospects round Of wide extent; ye varied prospects, hail! Where earth, and sky, and water, all combine, In all their wond'rous forms, to fill the soul With adoration to the glorious Author Of Nature's being and stupendous frame! Oft, as by Fancy led, I'll range the glade, Or tread the flow'ry lawn, or climb the hill, Or haunt the lonesome wood's sequester'd path, Or muse along the margin of the stream; And, while I visit Nature's local scenes, Her living beauties shall inspire my song. Then flow, my numbers, on in peaceful strains; For Nature's peaceful scenes I mean to sing In rural verse, and hail the great Creator With heart-felt praise! while mental gratitude Glows in my raptur'd breast, and mental love. Unutterable! sublime! stupendous theme! Language celestial might exhaust her stores In numbers great, at Heaven's high festival By laureat seraph sung; whose boldest flights But still proclaim how much is left unsung. Yet shall my grateful soul aspire to rise On wings of praise, towards th'Eternal's throne; Whilst I his gifts receive, and breathe his air, While with delight my wand'ring eye surveys Creation's ample round, this mundane scene, How wide! how glorious! how with wonders fill'd! How elevating to th'admiring mind!— See animated Nature, with her train, Her mighty, her innumerable train, Inhabiting earth, atmosphere, and sea, In species rang'd, various of strength and size, Distinguish'd by innumerable forms; Some led by wond'rous instinct, some endow'd With godlike reasoning powers; in action all, Exhibiting the various modes of life! While Vegetation robes the fertile earth In varied verdure, and in gay brocade; While Vegetation, from her liberal hand, Deals to the sons of life their sustenance! To her the learned botanist applies For every precious health-restoring herb. By her kind influence the buried grain Rises propitious to the hopes of man: By her kind influence fair Flora smiles, And gay Pomona, o'er her latent fruits, Which yet awhile compose her bloomy pride: She rears the prouder, tow'ring, leafy tribes, And tends the humble shrub, with equal care. Great Spring of Motion! vegetation's cause; And life's great fountain, whence but late I sprung; For great ambition bids me call thee Sire, And boast myself a native of the skies; Accept this filial tribute from my hand, And deign, at intervals, to be my theme, When gazing on thy works, they point to Thee! When atmosphere in thunder cries, a God! When ocean's billows roar Omnipotence! When continents and isles display their Maker In large expanding prospect! when I soar, And Heaven's broad fields amaze my ravish'd muse! The grand vicissitudes that mark the hours In which our globe revolves, I'll sing; the Morn With all her sweets, in all her gay attire Of summer garments clad; the radiant Noon, With all the pride of day; the milder Eve, And Sol's descending orb; the black-wing'd Night, Whose gloom, contrasted by her burning gems, With solemn grandeur fills her silent reign. But soft! the Morning, wrapt in mantle grey, Breaks faintly o'er yon interposing hills, Smiling serenely on the sleeping world, That, soon awaking, shall return her smile. Nor can I feel, unmov'd, her gentle ray, Re-cheering once again my grateful orbs, That roll'd, but now, bewilder'd and begloom'd Amid nocturnal shades:—Hail! glorious light! Heaven's fairest child, essence of beauty, hail! That best can'st speak the goodness and the pow'r Of Him who form'd you, and supplies your fires, Pay him a tribute of your brightest beams; While men and angels, wrapt in admiration, Behold the scene! display out all your wonders! Shine your Creator's praise from world to world, And blaze his glory through the universe! As yet I can survey the trembling stars, And yet but faintly view the objects round; Scarce is discernible that narrow path That leads across to yonder distant stile, Beyond whose dusky bars my doubtful eyes The rising ground and woodland kens obscure, Where nothing certain meets my straiten'd sight; But yonder gleam, now bright'ning in the east With gradual pace, will yet ere long restore The fields their verdure, and their tints the flow'rs. How pleasing 'tis to walk this early hour! T'indulge the mind in sacred contemplation, Free from disturbance, in these calm retreats, While all is silent, save the tinkling rill, Or whispering breeze that steals from Flora's bosom The sweets of flow'rs and aromatic herbs, Whose wafted odours oft regale the sense! Now fade the spangles in yon azure vault, While to the western deep the shadows fly, And hills, and dales, and groves, and lawns, appear In prospect more distinct; Nature awakes, And prompts her offspring to begin the strain, And tunes her universal voice to joy: For hark! along the hedge the early birds, As yet but softly twittering (hardly heard Amid the purling rivulet's plaintive noise) Preparing all to hail the God of day With grateful carol and exulting hymn.— And now the lark, suspended on the wing In air sublime, warbles his artless lay, And sweetly lengthens out each joyous note, Charming, with soft delight, the list'ning ear. Sweet bird! that celebrat'st the rising morn, Enraptur'd while I hear thy swelling strains, With thee I'd soar, and mix with thine my song.— Meanwhile, at distance, hear the bird of Mars, Perpetual harbinger of day's approach, In louder note proclaims returning morn Throughout the village, while from farm to farm The strain'd response is heard the country round. Proceed, my muse! sing how Aurora smiles: Mark how she blushes in the eastern sky, Tinging with purple half th'ethereal arch. Welcome, Aurora, to our hemisphere! Welcome, Aurora, to my gladden'd eyes! Thy milder aspect, and thy softer charms, Propitious ushering in the blaze of day, Bid waking Nature sweetly smile, and yield The tranquil breast a joy without a name. Thus far the dawn's refracted ray I've sung, And sometimes aim'd to snatch a thought sublime, Or grace or dignity to raise my song Above the multitude unknown to fame. But now behold a grander scene appears, That mocks the fervent efforts of my muse, Descriptive singing, where description fails. Come then, bright Inspiration! to my aid; Enthusiastic ardours, fill my breast! And, while my fir'd imagination burns, Be my effusions equal to my theme! I sing a purple sky, with clouds of gold; An orient horizon in a blaze Of bursting glory; an enlighten'd earth Of variegated form, and beauteous shades, With all those overwhelming floods of light That stream immediate from the fount of day! Great prince! and patron of th'inspiring nine, Bright Phœbus! in thy morning pomp array'd, That 'midst th'acclaim of universal joy Mak'st thy triumphal entry to the world, Rejoic'd thy rising glory I behold, Reviv'd thy vivifying warmth I feel, And grateful celebrate thy blest return! The welcome signal of thy first approach The mountains from their gilded summits gave: At length the misty vales enjoy thy rays, Whose vapours now subsiding, soon disclose The nether landscape, bright'ning to the view, Woods, winding streams, and dew-bespangled lawns. Shot from thy glowing disk, now just uprear'd, Earth chear'd receives thy horizontal beams; Fresh-growing vigour ev'ry herb resumes; The fragrant flow'rs expand their painted leaves; While animation feels extatic joys: The lowing herds, the bleating flocks uprise, The wanton kids and fawns with pleasure bound, The groves with aviarian concerts ring, And sweet responses charm from every bush. Thy genial influence all nature feels, With grateful sensibility replete, Save man's obdurate breast; whom thirst of gain, Whom jealousy, despair, or fell revenge, Has render'd callous to thy piercing ray. Well might the ancient pagan world proclaim Thee God of health, and harmony, and song! Well may the unenlighten'd Easterns bend With adoration to the rising sun! And well may we, of science more profound, Of truth's eternal oracles possess'd, When we behold thy broad emerging wheel, And view th'illuminated prospect round, To Him our grateful adoration pay, Who form'd thy burning orb, and myriads more, From us remote, perhaps, whose bulk and blaze Exceed beyond imagination thine! Without a grateful rapture, what cold breast Can feel the solar life-supplying fire, While pleasure finds its way through ev'ry sense, While all around conspires to yield it joy? With one ungenerous sentiment retain'd, Through this delightful valley who could stray, And view fair Spring unbosom all her charms, Her foliage, her blossoms, and her flow'rs, While heavenly Morning gilds the smiling scene, And Nature's voice is harmony and love? Enchanted here her beauties I explore, Amid the charm of birds and sweets of flow'rs; At ev'ry step I stay to gaze around, The prospect ever varying; while along The verge of this clear brook I take my way, And hear its pleasing murmurs: now it parts, A clump of weeping willows to embrace, And here again unites its lucid stream; Now with a narrower surface hurrying on, Now wid'ning as it winds among the shades Of this embow'ring copse, where, smooth as that In which Narcissus fatally admir'd His own reflection (as of old 'tis sung) It glides, and almost ceases to complain. Now to the ear, brought nearer by the breeze, Harsh roars the torrent from the clapp'ring mill Behind yon spacious orchard, whose rich bloom Portends autumnal plenty; now again Its less'ning clamour, which to distance yields, Is barely heard amid the gen'ral charm Of universal Nature's Morning song. From hence the elevated eye surveys, Extending on the left, th'aspiring hill, Up whose uneven side the thicket hangs, Oft frightful nodding o'er its winding base, That forms the sidelong bound of this gay mead, Now with sweet cowslips deck'd, and here and there A blooming hawthorn, underneath whose shade The primrose pale, that early meets the year, And heav'n-complexion'd violet, love to dwell. While all the right exhibits cultur'd fields, That gently rising face th'ascending sun, And bright reflect his glory: here the hand Of human industry is full display'd Amid earth's green productions, which of late Have felt the warmth, and drank the show'rs of spring, And promise well man's labour to repay. Through yonder opening pleasing is the view Of objects more at distance, where the sight Plays on an ampler scale: now village spires Appear, and villas gay, and spacious farms, With many a low-roof'd cottage, scarce observ'd By thoughtless Folly's superficial eye, By upstart Pride, that seldom deigns to note The humble dwellings of the labouring poor. O black Ingratitude! O shameful Pride! Whose cold contempt insults the honest poor, To whose humility and toil ye owe, Next the Divine permission (gracious giv'n And often unexpectedly resum'd) For all your superfluity and state. Their ready hands with patience hold the plough, And spread the latent harvest o'er your land; Their daily labour cultivates the ground, With ev'ry plant our happy climate yields; While the poor working manufact'rer's art Clothes and accommodates the princely peer. See yonder scaffold-girded building rise Beneath the skilful workmen's busy hands: Mark too the active labourers, that hard Their scanty wages earn, bearing aloft The ponderous materials for the pile; And let the tenant of magnificence Respect the hands that rais'd the stately dome. Now in th'adjacent field, where flocks and herds Promiscuous crop the blade, with chearful brow Her early task the ruddy-featur'd maid Begins, and each full udder to her pail Resigns its burthen, sweetly while she sings Her simple song of some inconstant swain, Or mournful fate of rural maids in love. Ah, damsel! may the moral of thy song Thy youthful heart from vile seduction guard! O thou sweet muse! that oft on Avon's banks Hast tun'd the harps, and taught th'immortal verse Of Bristol bards—that partial didst inspire Lactilla's numbers, while the rocky scene And Clifton's villa'd heights she sung—yet deign To crown my invocation with thy smiles, While emulous I court thy sacred aid, And sing the various beauties of the Morn! Thus far I've wander'd through the flow'ry vale, The thicket brush'd, and trac'd the mazy stream; And now ascending to the mountain's brow, (The lesser hills receding as I rise) A glorious western prospect opens large, In all the glow of Morning's youthful pride, And beauty and sublimity conjoin Their greater powers, with such effectual force To strike th'enamour'd and admiring mind, That gratitude, and love, and adoration, To Nature's general Parent lift the soul! [To be continued.] BENEVOLENCE. O heav'n-born Gratitude! that first attun'd Creation's voice to sing creating love, That strung with harmony the seraph's lyre, And taught the first archangel's trump to sound; Hail! thou heav'n-pleasing Pow'r! whose reign extends Through ev'ry order down to my poor breast, That now with joy expanded feels thy sway: By thee inspir'd, with heart rejoic'd I sing Benevolence, in human form divine, That prompted Liberality's blest hand (Generous) to deal, from Fortune's ample store, That kind relief which gave my bosom ease! Sacred Benevolence! my humble song Flows tributary from my heart to thee, Heav'n's darling attribute! by whom on earth The soul its form of Deity assumes, And looks with gracious dignity around (The pearls of pity starting from her eyes) Chearing the hearts of Sorrow and Distress, Till Sorrow's eye, resparkling, yields to joy, And Misery's dejected victim smiles. O thou blest city Bath.! through whose bosom fair Incessant flow thy ancient healing springs, Warm with the breath of Heaven's benevolence, By whom with precious qualities endow'd, Long ages ere (proud on her pedestal) The blue-ey'd goddess patroniz'd thy streams: O Bath! within whose hospitable gates, Unsought, unhop'd, Benevolence I found, So far surpassing ev'ry sanguine wish, That gratitude and joy o'erwhelm'd my soul! For there the pow'rful sympathetic voice Of soft Humanity had told my tale, And generous Compassion lent her ear! And art thou seated in our favour'd isle? With grateful pride does Albion boast thy wave, Whose blessing but a favour'd few may share, Gay Fortune's favourites, or the happy poor, Whose humbler fortune plac'd them near to thee? Yes! thou art seated in our favour'd isle; Fair Albion owns thy salutary wave, Which, if not yet accessible to all, Far other are than partial to a few. O! for example, view that thankful train Patients of the Bath Hospital for strangers. To health restor'd, with hopeful life renew'd, Preparing now to meet the longing arms Of those for whom their lives are doubly dear. With these, of late the prey of dire disease, Life-wearying Pain had fix'd her long abode, Had spent her fury on their shrinking frames, Perpetual, or with intermitting ease, With aggravated torture to return. Oft had they wish'd to prove the potent charm Of thy bless'd fountains; oft had long'd to drink (With eager thirst) the life-renewing draught, Or lave their poor emaciated limbs, And in thy waters lose their countless pangs. But Fate their stations far remote had set, And humble poverty remain'd their lot, Which, by affliction render'd more extreme, Made pinching want increase with racking pain, While helpless love and kindred grief, combin'd With pity, shed their unavailing tears. At length their groans were heard; their sad distress Sweet Mercy's eye beholding, wept; when straight Awakening in the soften'd human breast, O'er each less lib'ral impulse of the soul Benevolence assum'd her nat'ral sway; Bright shone fair Bounty in the splendid sphere Of Affluence, for free and large she gave; While Competence (though bare) with equal soul To yield her mite abridg'd her mod'rate fare. Thus from the distant mansion of distress The poor, disorder'd, hopeless wretch is brought, And (Heav'n's benevolence with human care Gracious co-operating) soon restor'd To friends and kindred (joyfully surpris'd) A grateful being, bless'd with health and joy! O! might this heart-felt sympathizing song But wake Benevolence in some cold breast, Where now perhaps she unsuspected lies Buried in prejudice or sordid cares! Proceed, my muse! but now expand the scene; For now my native sea-surrounded land, In mental prospect, grateful I survey, Heaven's bounty marking all her wide extent. Thrice happy Britain! once again to smile With peace and plenty bless'd, with glory crown'd! Thy sons, who lately brav'd the threat'ning world, And scarce your equal match, the world combin'd, Ye British subjects! to yourselves but true. O Britain! O Ierne! durst the muse Amid your counsels to intrude her song, That harmony she loves she would advise! Thus would she sing:—Let blest Concordia join In one great int'rest ev'ry partial view; And as ye 're sisters call'd, O! still be friends. Abreast your sons have fought, abreast they bled, And equal danger, death, or glory shar'd; And still united may your strength remain, To keep the tyrants of the world in awe! With gratitude, ye Britons, call to mind Yourselves, how bless'd above the nations round, Strangers to Liberty, your noblest pride, Whose air but breath'd gives freedom to the slave! 'Tis you that with security enjoy What Fortune gives, or what Industry stores: 'Tis you that are of mind and body free; For cursed Tyranny her hated name Here dares not own, much less with lawless pow'r To seize the legal property you hold, To bind your bodies, or prescribe your faith. O Liberty! thou blessing dear as life! Who robs me but of thee is half a murth'rer. There needs, 'tis true, society to shield From craft and crimes, for laws to be in force, And sad experience daily proves their use. But, O ye injur'd! when ye prosecute, And bring the trembling culprit to the bar, For sake of Heaven do not aim revenge!— And thou vindictive Being, that can'st hold Immur'd within a prison's dreary walls Thy brother for a debt he cannot pay; A man, perhaps, who wears an honest heart, Who wrestled with his fortune ere he fell, But 'tis not ev'ry mortal's lot to thrive: Perhaps, in all the bitterness of grief, His hapless wife and offspring shed their tears, Without a friend to soften their distress; Perhaps in their distress they come to thee, Beseeching mercy for the sake of Heav'n! Inexorable wretch! see how they kneel, And pray, with lifted hands and streaming eyes, For mercy! heavenly mercy! Oh! from thee.— Alas! distress may plead, and grief may weep, But nature long has left his callous breast, Whose pity these so vainly hope to move With pray'rs and tears. Ah! see, they wring their hands, And yield to black despair, convinc'd at last, Poor souls! they cried for mercy to a stone!

Ev'n the poor criminal, whom Justice dooms To expiation by a shameful death, Though all the dire necessity will own, Yet none should triumph o'er his hapless fate; For ah! Humanity regrets the sight, Weeps o'er the wretched victim to the laws, And, calling bright Religion to her aid, Cheers the repenting soul with hopes of Heav'n! [To be continued.]</field>
