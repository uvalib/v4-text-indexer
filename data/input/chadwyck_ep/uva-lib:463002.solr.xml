Paragraphs in this text are signified by markers. The paragraphs have been captured, but the markers ignored. Jhesu Cryst heuen kynge Sende all them good endynge That on this werke wyll rede or loke Gyue atenda?ce here or correcte this boke The whiche is of the synnes seuen Dysapoyntynge many soules frome heuen And of the remedyes and the cyrcumstaunce Of this is the chefe substaunce And howe thou shalte thyselfe shryue Of euery thynge thy conscyence dothe greue. If thy soule be out of synne whiche is treason. To shewe of his beaute it passeth my reason But and it be in synne and purpose there to abyde. Without helpe to helle it wyll glyde. This is trewe and a Iuste case Eeuery thynge wyll to his naturall place. Ensample of the same take a feder Caste it frome the an hyghe in the weder Thoughe it be lyght and byde there a season It cometh agayne to y? erth y? may preue by reason. So the lenger a soule is in contynuaunce. The further fro god and the nerer to vengeaunce. The furthest place from god is the dungeon of hell Upon this thou mayst bothe bye and sell. Whiche is a place naturall for synners and synne. There to abyde euer and neuer to blynne And thou trust vpon longe lyfe &amp; to amende in aege I rede the beware of this terryble cage If sodayne dethe come and take the than Whether shall thy soule thou synfull man. Leue synne sone or synne leue the Come to thy ghostly fader and saye (Benedicite) And be thy synnes neuer so grete and many Neuer mystrust our sauyours mercy The mercy of god it passeth all thynge. As I fynde in holy wrytynge. (Sicut sintilla ignis in medio maris noli) (I ta iniquitas viri in misericordia dei.) Loke howe a sparcle of fyre is quenched in the see. So is all a mannes synnes and iniquyte In our lordes mercy and more redy to forgyue Then thou to aske mecy/this I do preue Therfore sone in ony thynge thou couthe Shewe thy confessyon with thyne owne mouthe For yf a surgean haue an hurte man in cure He must knowe the wounde iuste and sure Wherwith it was hurte/and in what place it is And than maye he helpe hym by good practys Therfore sone spare thou nought If ony synne thou haue wrought And I wyll mynystre medysens sure and sole That shall make the parfytely hole And bycause thou arte not lerned I saye than I wyl helpe the and I can And there as thou fyndest thyselfe gylty Holde vp thy handes and aske god mercy.

Hym that hathe the good taught Haste thou ony tyme boost made Of ony thynge thou haste hade Of vertue/of connynge or of wyt whiche god hymselfe sende the hyt. Or of chylde father or mother Of kynne syster or of brother Of theyr inherytaunce fame or mode. Or because they haue had moche good Of catayll of golde and syluer also Of place of housholde w? purtena?ce therto. Haste thou thyne owne gylte forsaken. And to another the blame taken Haste thou fayned thyselfe holy To hypocrysy and to foly In trust that it sholde be hyde. Thy foule synne and thy foule pryde Haste thou ony tyme by vayne glory Thought thyselfe so good and holy That thou hast had grete dysdayne Of thy neyghbours that thou hast sayne Haste thou ben proude my sone I saye Bycause thou hast ben stedfast in the faye. Hast thou ony tyme taken on the Ony good dede of charyte That was another mannes doynge. And of thyne no maner thynge Hast thou oppressed thy neyghboure. To gete the good and honoure Hast thou shente his good fame For to gete the a good name. Haste thou also proude be Of ony thynge god gaue the For thy voyce was good and hye. Or for thy wyt was good and slye Or for thy heere was cryspe and longe. Or for thou hast a reasonable tonge. Or for thou arte myghty and stronge. Or for thy body is fayre and longe Or for thy flesshe is whyte and clene None the lyke dost thou wene. Haste thou be proude by strete or borde Upon trust of lady or lorde. Hast thou be proude of worshyp or good. Or thou comest of grete blode Hast thou ony tyme prouder the made Of ony offyce chat thou hast hade Hast thou be proude ghoostly E?s.Tell me sone hardely Of mekenes of pacyence or of pyte. Of beaute of eloquence or of chastyte And of other vertues many mo. Sone hast thou synned in tho Hast thou ony tyme with herte proute. Anothers synne spoken oute And thyne entencyon suche it was That thy synne sholde seme the las. Hast thou be proude and glad in thought. Of ony synne that thou hast wrought Hast thou be proude of ony guyse Of ony thynge that thou dydest vse Of party hosen or of pyked shone. Or of garded clothes as foles done cristus. Of landes of rentes or of gay howsynge Of many seruauntes to thy byddynge Or of horses fatte and rounde. Or for thy goodes are saufe and sounde Or for thou arte so myghty and ryche That no neyghboure is the lyche. Or yf thou be a crafty man And canst more than another can Haste thou be proude of tenyse playenge Of daunsynge or of barre castynge. If thou haue ben this maner proute. Shryue the sone and tell it oute Of Enuye. The seconde synne in ordre veryly Is the foule synne of Enuy. Hast thou ben euermore grutchynge. Agaynst god for ony thynge Hast thou ben in herte glad. When thy neyghboure hathe harme had Hast thou had in herte grefe. Of his good and his relefe Hast thou be glad and mery When he hath ben seke and sory Or hast thou ben sory and madde When he hathe ben mery and gladde. Or that the worlde standeth not with the. As dothe with hym in no degre. Or bycause he hathe shepe and fell Horse kyne or other catell. Corne grasse haye to mowe Wode or pasture more then thowe Remembre sone the chaunce and course. Thoughe he be ryche what arte y? y? worse. And thou be poore and thy good go awaye. Thou canst not passe from Ioye vnto Ioye Thanke god of pouerte and fle from seuen. And y? shalte enheryte y? kyngdome of heu? He that hathe good hathe grete cure Ihesu.Of this I fynde in holy scrypture. Sanitas continua &amp; rerum habundantia Sunt eterne dampnationis iudicia Mercy.When a m?nes herte is on his good annexte Therin is grete Ieoperdy as sayth y? texte. Hast y? noyed thy neygbour by ony cha?ce For ony promocyon that dyde hym auaunce Or because he behaueth h?selfe am?ge m? And better in fauoure then thou ken With his mayster lorde or kynge Or hathe more then thou of chepynge. Or that he is more able then thowe To all maner grace or prowe. Haste thou in hele or sykenesse Borne ony false wytnesse A yenst thy neyghboure free or bonde And madest hym lese good or londe Haste thou enuyed thyne vnderlynge For he was good and thryuynge Or lest he wolde passe the In vertue or ony other degre. Haste thou for hate or enuye Holpen or counsayled for tolye Or ony man for to defame. Or for to stroye his good name Haste thou bakbyted thy neyghbore For to make hym fare the wore. Haste thou reysed ony debate Amonges they neyghbours for ony hate Haste thou spared for enuye To teche a man his harme to flye. Whan thou myghtest by thy warnynge Haue hym saued from his harmynge And ony other thynge come to thy mynde Shewe it forth leue none behynde. And what thou hast more in thy thought. Shryue the sone and spare it nought Of Couetyse. The thyrde synne without myse Mercy. Is the synne of Couetyse Haste thou man in ony wyse. By wronge and couetyse Ihesu. Begyle thy neyghboure fre or bonde Mercy.Of his house good or londe. And by strength &amp; extorcy? kepest possessy? And makest therof no maner restytucyon O mortall man remebre this chaunce Before god it asketh vengeaunce Et non deletur peccatum Nisi restituatur oblatum. Thus in scrypture I haue it founde. And in englysshe I wyll it expounde A man of his synne can haue no remyssyon. Unto suche tyme he haue made restytucy?. Haste thou lyen by waye or by strete There thy neyghboure for to mete. And thyne entencyon suche it was To robbe hym of his good more and las Or hast broken his house by daye or nyght And caryed his good out of his syght Doynge so thou wylte be shente. It is agaynst goddes commaundemente. Hast thou borne out of chyrche or chyrchay. Ony thynge ye or naye As golde and syluer or ony other wede Thou standest accursed in the dede. Usury or okur bothe be none. Doste thou vse ony of those or none This is a synne full greuous IhesusBefore our sauyoure Ihesus. God taketh moche on greffe To sell a man in his myscheffe Ony thynge to hygheprys Well I knowe vsury it is And to lende .xii. pens and to haue thyrtene This is vsury as I wene At syses sessyons haste thou ben thare. To put thy neyghboure to trouble and care. So by thy couetyse mynde extorcyon and strength Some wynnynge thou hast had therof at lengthe Hast thou vsed w? mesures or weyghtes to by &amp; sell And thou haue I charge the to tell. And as trewe as I am a man Mercy. I wyll helpe the and I can. Haste thou coueted ony mannes doughter or wyfe. With them to lyue a synfull lyfe His hors his catell or other good lo Of the whiche thou hast had no ryght therto. By cursed couetyse and vngracyous wyght Not carynge howe thou haddest come by hit Hast thou on thy good thy mynde set in ordynatly And not sayd to god for it gramercy Remembre the story in holy wrytynge Of Dyues the ryche man and of his lyuynge Whose soule is nowe in hell full lowe And wherfore was it as you trowe As sure and as trewe as I wrote this verse It was for the cause I dyde reherse He wolde not for the loue of swete Ihesus. Helpe nor socoure the poore man Lazarus. With his goodes lesse nor more Nor no poore man at his dore. Wherfore for nowe he cryeth alas And curseth the tyme that borne he was. Alas/alas be ware by me. Quante sunt tenebre The derkenes of hell as trewe as is the crede. Men maye fele it as I rede. Haste thou ben couetyse/or ben tysynge Withdrawynge thy duety as offrynge or tythynge The whiche thou knowest is thy dewe Of euery thynge that dothe renewe Bothe of small and of greate Of shepe of swyne or of neate. Outher of goodes in thy possessyon hauynge Haste thou spended them in myslyuynge I se not but before god as moche synne is To myspende thy good as to wynne it amys. Beynge in ony of these daungers shewe it oute I wyll helpe the without doute So that thou wylte be ruled and do well Somwhat after my counsell. Of the synne of wrathe. Wrathe than is the fourth synne And grete Ieoperdy to slepe therin. Haste thou ony tyme in thy desyre In thy malyce and in thy yre. That at thy pleasure/and for thy sake. Uengeaunce vpon man or beest sholde be take. Hast thou in thy malyce yre and werke Layde vyolent hande on preest or clerke Or on thy neyghboure/in cyte or shyre Otherwyse then good ordre wyll requyre. On wyfe chylde or seruaunte. Beynge with the in seruyce or conaunte So sore peraduenture thou dydest them streke. That synewe or bone thou dedest breke Or so sore hathe ben theyr correccyon. That terme of theyr lyues hath thought the on. If thou haue done so do not blynne Shryue the sone for it is synne Haste thou in wrath made ony debate Amonges neyghbours or estate Shewe me sone and do not skof And what inconuenyence cometh therof Haste thou in malyce ony tyme or ofte. Thy ghoostly fader set at noughte And hym rebuked in house or bordres Or ony other within holy ordres. Hast thou ben dysobedyent vnto father or mother Unto thy father in aege or suche other And whan they haue the good taughte In thy malyce sette them at naughte This is the Iuste and veramente Agaynst the fourthe commaundemente Thou sholdest not sone in no wyse. Stere them to wrathe nor yet to malyce But them to worshyppe and honoure To them knele and also coure. And them to soccure in tyme of nede With golde and syluer with fode and wede And th? not to begyle of goodes nor landes Nor to laye on them vyolent handes Doynge thus this is thy mede Thou arte accursed in very dede And canst not be assoyled Iust and sure Ihesu.But of hym that hath the bysshops powre. Doste thou in thy malyce or in thy fume The goodes of god them consume In sekynge counsayle of men of lawe When thy matter is not worth a strawe But as who sayth I wyll do this. I tell the sone thou dost amys Thou sholdest forgyue in thy herte fre All those that dothe offende the. Haste thou troubled ony prest or clerke That were busy in good werke Cryst hymselfe calleth this house. The chyrche truely his owne spouse The whiche is made for nought elles But for prayer as the boke telles There thou sholdest gete thyne ynne To praye and wepe for thy synne Haste thou for malyce or ony tyme besyde Used wytchcrafte by ony tyde He that byleueth in the faye Must leue it by ye and naye For it is a mynde of the deuyll Causynge the people to do euyll. And suche byleue maketh them haue ye that wytchcrafte shall them saue So with charmes and with tell They be brought agayne to hell. Thus with the deuyll they be blynde. And in theyr fayth ferre behynde Haste thou vsed by wrathe or meuynge Ony grete othes or blasphemynge To swere or curse dost thou not care. I rede the sone of this beware Where swerynge is vsed without drede U?gea?ce is there h?gyng as heuy as lede And but thou amende thy lyfe ere. It wyll fell on thyselfe or thy louere. Hast y? in thy malyce hurte thy neyghbour Of his good name fame or honoure. His good or catayll by waye or strete Or in ony other place thou dydest it mete Hast thou ony tyme put or begon. Wr?gfully thy neyghbour to his purgacy? Thou art to blame suche werkes to werche And accursed by holy chyrche Hast thou taken from hym his good fame Or called hym by ony nycke name As traytoure thefe or ony other syche. Shryue the sone I am a lyche I am here sone in goddes stede. I maye helpe the do not drede, And as truely as euer m? dranke in dysshe I wyll make the hole as ony fysshe Somtyme though thou be wrath y? dost not offede If thou do thy neyghboure to amende.
