      <field name="fulltext">THE ATHENAID. ???? ?? ?????? ???? ????????? ?????? ?????? ??? ????? ????? ????? ???????. ÃSCHYL. PERSÃ. VOL. I. BOOK the First. The Persians vanquish'd, Greece from bondage sav'd, The death of great Leonidas aveng'd By Attic virtueâcelebrate, O Muse! A burning ray the summer solstice cast, Th' Olympiad was proclaim'd; when Xerxes pour'd His millions through ThermopylÃ¦, new-stain'd With blood. From Athens Ãschylus divine In genius, arts, and valour, musing deep On his endanger'd country's future doom, Repairs, invited by an evening still, To clear Ilissus, Attic stream renown'd. Beneath an oak, in solitary state Apart, itself a wood, the hero's limbs On tufted moss repose. He grasps the lyre; Unfolded scrolls voluminous he spreads Along the ground: high lays repeating thence, Leonidas the Spartan he extols, And sweeps th' accordant strings. To closing day He bade farewel, and hail'd th' ascending stars In music long continued; till the stream With drowsy murmur won his eye to sleep, But left his fancy waking. In a dream The god of day, with full meridian blaze, Seem'd to assume his function o'er the skies; When, lo! the earth divided: through the cleft A gush of radiance dimm'd the noon-tide sun. In structure all of diamond, self pois'd, Amid redundant light a chariot hung Triumphal. Twelve transparent horses breath'd Beams from their nostrils, dancing beams of day Shook from their manes. In lineaments of man, Chang'd to immortal, there the mighty soul Of Sparta's king apparent shone. His wounds Shot forth a splendour like the clust'ring stars, Which on Orion's chest and limbs proclaim Him first of constellations. Round in cars Of triumph too arrang'd, the stately forms Of those whom virtue led to share his doom, And consecrate ThermopylÃ¦ to fame. Pines tipp'd with lightning seem'd their spears; their shields Broad like Minerva's Ã¦gis: from their helms An empyreal brightness stream'd abroad: Ineffable felicity their eyes, Their fronts the majesty of gods display'd. Erect the glorious shape began to speak In accents louder than a bursting cloudâ Pentelicus, Hymettus seem'd to shake Through all their quarries, and Ilissus beat His shudd'ring banks in tumultâThou, whose muse Commands th' immortalizing trump of fame, Go to the sage Hellanodics, the just El?an judges of Olympian palms; There in thy own celestial strains rehearse, Before that concourse wide, our deeds and fate. Let our example general Greece inspire To face her danger; let the Spartan shield Protect th' Athenians, else I died in vain. The brilliant vision, now dispersing, leaves The wond'ring bard. He, starting, in his ken Discerns no other than the real scene Of shadows brown from close embow'ring wood, Than distant mountains, and the spangled face Of heav'n, reslected from the silver stream. But pensive, brooding o'er his country's fate, His step he turns. Themistocles, who rul'd Athenian councils, instant he accosts With large recital of his awful dream. Obey the mandate, cries the chief: alarm Th' Olympian concourse: from the Delphian port Of Cirrha sail for Elis: on thy way Consult Apollo in the state's behalf, Which to that function nominates thy worth: Of Xerxes' march intelligence obtain. This said, they parted. Ãschylus by dawn Commenc'd his progress, join'd by numbers arm'd, Like him to Pisa's barrier destin'd all, Electing him their chief. Five times the sun Renew'd his orbit, five successive nights The moon enlarg'd her crescent, ere they reach'd PhÅbean Delphi, seated on a rock Abrupt, sublime. Yet thence the curious eye Must upward look to meet the summits blue Of double-topp'd Parnassus, where the god Oracular is worshipp'd. Here they trac'd Barbarian violence profane. Consurn'd Were hamlets, temples levell'd to the dust, The statues broken, each religious bow'r A burning mass of embers. Wrapt in smoke, With cinders strewn, so glows the region round Portentous Ãtna, or Vesuvius dire, Death's flaming cauldrons; when their stony ribs And min'ral bowels, liquefied by fire, O'erwhelm the fields, by nature left unbless'd, Alone unbless'd of all Sicania's bound, Or lovely-fac'd Hesperia. Dubious here Th' Athenians halt, while fierce the sultry noon Inflames the sky. From Delphi's open gates, To Attic eyes no stranger, Timon comes, Sage priest of PhÅbus, magistrate unsoil'd, The public host of Athens, to the plain Descending swift with followers who bear His buckler, spear, and armour. On his head Were ashes sprinkled: rent, his garb presag'd Some black disaster. What malignant dart Of fortune wounds thee? Ãschylus aloud, While by the hand Cecropia's host he press'd. To him the Delphian: From deserted roofs, Depopulated streets, I come to hail Thee, bound by hospitable ties my friend, Thee, dear to PhÅbus, by Minerva grac'd, Thy country's goddess. Me thou often saw'st A parent bless'd in Amarantha's bloom, Yet ripe in virtue. Her, presenting pray'r With votive flow'rs before Minerva's shrine, This very hour Barbarians have enthrall'd, Borne in my sight precipitate away. O wife lamented, gather'd in thy prime By ruthless Pluto! in Elysian groves How shall I meet thee, and the tidings bear Of thy lost child, to servitude a prey, To violation doom'd? Yet more: the rage Of these invaders, who have spoil'd our fields, Defac'd our temples, driv'n to shelt'ring caves, To pathless cliffs, our populace dismay'd, Is now ascending to insult the fane, With sacrilegious violence to seize Th' accumulated off'rings by the great And good from age to age devoted there. He scarce had finish'd, when the earth beneath Rock'd from her center in convulsive throes; From pole to pole th' ethereal concave groan'd: Night from her cavern with gigantic steps Bestrode the region, lifting high as heav'n Her broad, infernal palm, whose umbrage hides The throne of light; while, glancing through the rifts Of her black mantle, overlaid with clouds, Blue vapours trail'd their fires. The double head Of tall Parnassus reeling, from the crag Unloos'd two fragments; mountainous in bulk, They roll to Delphi with a crashing sound, Like thunder nigh whose burst of ruin strikes The shatter'd ear with horror. Thus the bard Unmov'd, while round him ev'ry face is pale: Not on our heads these menaces are thrown By ireful nature, and portentous heav'n; Th' unrighteous now, th' oppressor of mankind, The sacrilegious, in this awful hour Alone should feel dismay. My Delphian host, Who knows but thund'ring Jove's prophetic son Now vindicates his altar; in his name Now calls the turbid elements to war? What shrieks of terror fill thy native streets! The hills with barb'rous dissonance of cries, The caverns howl. Athenians, be prepar'd, Best so when arm'd: then, Timon, case thy limbs; The season teems with prodigy. Secure In conscious virtue, let us calmly watch The mighty birth. By heav'n! through yonder gate The foes are driven; confusion, wild despair, With panic dread pursue them: friends, embrace Th' auspicious moment; lift your pious blades, Ye chosen men, auxiliars to a god! He spake, advancing with his holy friend To battle. Shiv'ring at their own misdeed, At heav'n-inflicted punishment, the foes Unnerv'd, distracted, unresisting, deem'd The warriors two celestials from above, Cas'd in Vulcanian panoply, to wage The war of gods. The whole Athenian train In equal fervour with Barbarian blood Distain their weapons. So from forests drear, When barren winter binds the foodful earth, Enrag'd by famine, trooping wolves invade A helpless village; unwithstood, they range With greedy fangs, and dye with human gore The snow-envelop'd ways. The Delphian race, By fear so lately to the neighb'ring hills And caves restrain'd, forsake their shelt'ring holds; In clusters rushing on the foes dismay'd, Accomplish their defeat. Th' Athenian chief Triumphant, red with massacre, admits A Persian youth to mercy, who his shield And sword surrenders. Persian, dost thou hope Thy flow'ring bloom shall ripen to enjoy A length of days? (severe his victor spake) Then to my questions utter words sincere. Reveal thy name, thy father's. Where encamps The host of Xerxes? Whither doth he point His inroad next? To violate this fane By his appointment was thy youth compell'd? Last, if thou know'st, what impious savage tore The Delphian maiden from Minerva's shrine? The Persian answers with a crimson'd cheek, With eyes in tearsâAh! little now avails Th' illustrious current of Argestes' blood To me a captive, less the name I bear Of Artamanes. By the king's decree That we were sent, that I unwilling came, Is truth sincere. Our leader slain, the heaps Of these disfigur'd carcases have made Their last atonement to th' insulted god. The king in rich Orchomenus I left; Who through BÅotia meditates to march Against th' Athenians. He, alas! who seiz'd The beauteous virgin at Minerva's shrine, He is my brother, eldest of the race, Far hence secure; while captive here I mourn His heinous outrage, and my own disgrace. Addressing Timon, here Cecropia's bard: Preserve this youth a hostage for thy child: He seems deserving; thee I know humane. Now to Apollo's temple be my guide. Still dost thou droop?âO Ãschylus, exclaims Desponding Timon, from the woes begun This day in Delphi, I to Athens trace A series black with evil. Lo! the wise, The righteous Aristides from your walls Through jealousy of merit is expell'd; Themistocles the cause. Himself, though great, Yet envious, and ambitious that his light May blaze unrivall'd, of th' Athenian state Extinguishes the brightest. Sparta shews, At this dread crisis, how the hearts of men By selfish cares and falsehood are deprav'd. She to the land of Pelops still confines Her efforts, on the neighb'ring isthmus rears A partial bulwark, leaving half the Greeks, Your noble seat, this oracle, expos'd To devastation: little she regards Our god profan'd, our progeny enslav'd; Her chief Pausanias, arrogant and stern, O'erlooks my suff'rings. Feeling what I fear For thee and others, I must droop, my friend. To him the bard, in these sententious strains: Not endless sunshine is the lot of man, Nor ever blooming seasons. Night succeeds The day, as day the night: rude winter frowns, Fair summer smiles. Thus variable the mind, Not less than human fortune, feels the strife Of truth and error, which alternate reign The arbiters of nature. Dark the deed, A deed of gloomy night, when envy forc'd The best Athenian from his natal roof: But light will soon return. Though Sparta break Her promise pledg'd; though false BÅotia prop A foreign throne; still Athens will sustain Herself and Greece, will retribution pay To Aristides, and her morn dispel The mist of error with a glorious blaze. No moreâmy duty calls me to the fane. They move, and passing by Minerva's grove, Two monuments of terror fee. There stopp'd The massy fragments, from Parnassus rent: An act of nature, by some latent cause Disturb'd. Tremendous o'er Barbarian ranks The ruins down the sacred way had roll'd, Leaving its surface horrible to sight; Such as might startle war's remorseless god, And shake his heart of adamant. Not long This blood-congealing spectacle detains The troop, which swiftly to the Pythian dome Press their ascending steps. The martial bard First, as enjoin'd by holy form, to scenes Far diff'rent, sweet Castalia's fount and grove, Resorts, with pure ablution to redeem From dust and slaughter his polluted limbs, To holy eyes obscene. Beside the fane, Within a flow'ring bosom of the hill, Through veins of rock beneath embow'ring shade, The rills divine replenish, as they flow, A cavity of marble. O'er the brim, In slender sheets of liquid crystal, down They fall harmonious. Plistus takes below To his smooth bed their tribute. Plunging there In deep obscurity of wood, whose roof With ridgy verdure meets the low-bent eye From that stupendous cliff, his current winds Through shade awhile; thence issuing large in view, Refreshes grateful meads, by mountains edg'd, Which terminate on Cirrha, Delphian port. Beyond her walls blue Neptune spreads his face Far as Achaia's wide expanse of coast, With tow'rs and cities crown'd. The maible fount On either side is skirted thick by groves Of ancient laurel with luxuriant arms, In glossy green attir'd. There PhÅbus, pride Of Parian quarries, stands a form divine, In act to draw an arrow from the case Loose hanging o'er his shoulder; and in look Serene, but stern: his worshippers to guard, As if the Pythian serpent were in sight, He meditates the combat. Here disarm'd, His limbs from all th' impurities of Mars Th' Athenian purges. Menial care supplies A garment silver-white: an olive branch His suppliant hand sustains. He seeks the fane; He mounts the steps magnificent: the gates On sounding hinges turn their brazen valves. Across an area vast, with solemn shade Of massy columns border'd, slow he moves His manly frame. Procumbent at the mouth Of that abyss oracular, whose fume Breathes wild sensation through the Pythian maid, With hands outstretch'd, he offers up this pray'r: O vanquisher of Python! Seed of Jove, Whose eleutherian might the tyrant dreads! Bright pow'r of day, dispenser of that fire Which kindles genius in the human breast! God of that light diffusing through the soul The rays of truth and knowledge! Friend to man, His monitor prophetic! O admit Athenians, anxious for their country's weal, In this her day of peril to consult Thy wisdom, thy protection to implore! Her tripod high the prophetess ascends: Enthusiastic motion strains her form, In flashes rolls her eyeballs, and bespreads Her agitated front with floating hair. Her weight a laurel, planted nigh, upholds, Which she embraces; her convulsive grasp Shakes to the root the groaning trunk, the boughs, The clatt'ring foliage. Forth she bursts in foam. Fly, wretched men, to earth's extremest bound! I see, I see th' Acropolis in flames, Your temples crumble, and your turrets nod: I see the blood run sable through your streets. All unabash'd, the hero firm replies: Yet further speak. Though citadel and fanes Be doom'd to ashes, must the nation fall? If so, instruct thy suppliants how their fall May prove most glorious in the sight of gods And men.âThe Pythian answers with a look Of pity, soft'ning her tempestuous rage: Ah! still my tongue like adamant is hard. Minerva's tow'rs must perish: Jove severe So wills; yet granting, at his daughter's suit, Her people refuge under walls of wood. But shun the myriads of terrific horse, Which on your fields an eastern Mars will range. She ceas'd; Th' Athenian notes her answer down: To one, the most entrusted of his train, He gives the tablet. Back to Athens fly, He said; the son of Neocles alone, By his unbounded faculties, can pierce The hidden sense of these mysterious strains; All which of Xerxes thou hast heard, report: I must depart to Elis.âMust thou go? Dejected Timon then: what safety here For me remains? Barbarians will return; My countrymen, dishearten'd as before, Resort to caverns. Though the god hath sav'd His shrine, the rest of Phocis lies a prey, BÅotia, Locris, Doris, to the foe. Yet what have I, O Ãschylus! to dread? I have no other child for savage force To violate: In Amarantha lost, My joy, my hope are vanish'd; and the hand, Which lays me breathless, will befriend me best. Th' Athenian here: Unmanly is despair, A noxious weed, whose growth, my Delphian host, Let courage wither. PhÅbus hath denounc'd The waste of Athens. Hopeful I forebode, That prouder walls and battlements will lift Their heads for ages; and that eye of Greece With inextinguishable ray surpass Its former lustre. Quit this dang'rous place, With us embarking: borrow help from time, Safe counsellor to wisdom. You, the race Of holy Delphi, should the foe return, Again dispersing to your caves, rely On your protecting god. Not vers'd alone In holy rites, in arms and council tried, A chief like Timon fame forbids to hide His dignity in caverns.âTimon here: Thou shalt conduct me, thou my friendly star! Meantime selected messengers I send The needful barks at Cirrha to prepare. Now from the temple under Timon's roof Admitted, vig'rous with refection due Of rest and food, to Cirrha they proceed With Artamanes. Ready are the barks, The gale propitious, calm the wat'ry plain: When, like the feather'd sojourners, who leave Their late abode on winter's bleak approach, To wing their flight for climates more benign, These with extended canvas quit the port, And, doubling round Achaia, cut the main To sacred Pisa. On their way the harp Of Ãschylus, preluding to the strain Which on his banks Alph?us was to hear, Relieves the sailor toiling at his oar, Enchants the wind retentive of the sounds Which harmonize his breath. If round the keel Of sweet Arion dolphins ever play'd, Or blithsome Nereids to the pleasing mood Of Orpheus danc'd, while Argo plough'd the deep; They now had felt controulment as in bonds, Not on their pliant, azure-glossy fins Disporting light, but rigid with amaze At this majestic muse. Yet sounding verse, In solemn cadence to the deep-ton'd lyre, Which could the boist'rous mariner subdue, The ear of Timon, languid by despair, Rejects, attentive to his grief alone, Which sighs within. Society is pain, Ev'n with his friend. A solitary couch He seeks; recumbent, not reposing, there Consumes the hours in pertinacious woe, Which sheds no tear. If wearied nature sinks, His sleep is troubled; visions of the night Appal his spirit; starting, he forsakes A thorny pillow; rushes on the deck With lamentations to the midnight moon. Alarm'd, th' Athenian chief approaching seiz'd On Timon's hand; with earnest looks enquir'd Why thus complaining he disturbs the calm, From his own pillow chacing due repose? Ah! I have seen my daughter, he replies, Have seen her twice!âWhere seen her? all distress'd Th' Athenian questions.âOn a rock she stood, A naked rock, the parent wild exclaims; Unloos'd her zone, dishevell'd was her hair; The ravisher was nigh. On sight of me, Who no assistance from the shore could reach, O father, father! I am sham'd, deflower'd, But here will end my sorrows and disgrace; She said, and plung'd precipitate. I saw Her body swallow'd by the greedy surge, Unwept, depriv'd of sepulture, to float. Illusion all! the bard consoling spake; The phantom offspring of distemper'd sleep. A second time, the frantic sire pursues, Did Amarantha meet my aking sight; Then, like an eastern concubine attir'd, Her head was blazon'd with Barbaric gems; With golden gloss her wanton garment wav'd: With her despoiler hand in hand she walk'd, Disclaim'd her father, and her father's gods. Oh then I wish'd her on the waves again, To parch in winds, or sate some vulture's beak! The youthful captive Artamanes, rous'd, Stands nigh in gen'rous tears. To him the bard: Ingenuous Persian, check thy tears, and lend Thy hand benign: committed to his couch Him watch and succour.âHourly was perform'd The pious office; noblest Delphians round Assist in tears; while now the moonlight twice Danc'd on the billows. On the second morn They land in Elis. Fame had gone before, Promulgating the valour which aveng'd The Delphian god, prophetic light to man, Ev'n more than Jove in Ammon's Libyan shrine Or DodonÃ¦an groves. A shining car Waits on the shore; a herald there salutes The warrior bard. Divine Athenian, hail! Hail, righteous captain of a righteous band! These olive crowns to thee and them I bear; So have the sage Hellanodics ordain'd, Who to their just tribunal through my voice Invite thy presence. Ãschylus receives The victor's chaplet, and ascends the car. Along Alph?us to th' Olympian lists He passes through spectators all array'd In garlands too, and num'rous like the flow'rs Embellishing the river's fragrant sides, Or like the pebbles in his murm'ring bed. Th' approach of Ãschylus is known. Between Two rows of victors in their olive crowns He o'er the sanded area greets the thrones, Where, grac'd with scepters magisterial, sat Th' El?an judges. Standing on the car, To them, uprising from their seats, he spake: If to have fought for Delphi and her god Deserve this chaplet, what superior praise To him is due, who voluntary died For LacedÃ¦mon? But he claims no more Than emulation from the sons of Greece, Like him to save their countries and their laws. He hath his honours in the bless'd abodes; From him I come deputed; hear in me Leonidas. A vision, as of gods, To me, late slumb'ring on Ilissus, rose; In semblance rose Leonidas, begirt With all the virtuous partners in his fate. Before me earth divided; through the cleft A gushing radiance dimm'd the eye of noon. In structure all of diamond, self-pois'd, Amid redundant light, a chariot hung Triumphal. Twelve transparent horses breath'd Beams from their nostrils, dancing beams of day Shook from their manes. In lineaments of man, Chang'd to immortal, with a shape enlarg'd, A stature lengthen'd, there the mighty soul Of Sparta's king apparent shone. His wounds Shot forth a starlike splendour. Round in cars Triumphal too arrang'd, the stately forms Of those whom virtue led to share his doom, And consecrate ThermopylÃ¦ to fame. To me these words the glorious shape address'd: Go to the sage Hellanodics, the just El?an judges of Olympian palms: In that wide concourse celebrate my death. Let my example gen'ral Greece inspire To face her danger; let the Spartan shield Protect th' Athenians, else I died in vain. Attention mute th' Hellanodics command: The thick'ning crowd is hush'd. The bard proceeds, While inspiration swells his copious breast, Flames in his eye, and thunders from his voice. Parnassian PhÅbus he invok'd, the pow'r Of prophecy and song. His aid is due In celebration of the man who heard The oracle from Delphi, and obey'd. âA king deriv'd from Hercules must die âFor LacedÃ¦mon.â Who obedient heard? Leonidas: he left his household gods, His wife belov'd, his offspring; at the gate Of Greece, ThermopylÃ¦, he fought, he fell: With him what heroes? Alpheus, Maron bled, There Agis, there Di?neces, the seer, Megistias, bold Diomedon, the youth Of Dithyrambus, Thespia's hoary chief, Demophilus; for you they all expir'd: Rise, Greeks, revenge their fall! in that revenge Your laws, your manners, and religion save. You who aspire to these Olympic wreaths, The brightest guerdon to a Grecian brow, Yet will you linger, till Barbaric arms Annihilate th' Olympiad? Not to die Leonidas invites; no, Greeks, to live! Surmounting foes enervate by the dread His death impress'd, to fill your cup of life With virtuous glory, to enjoy your hopes In peace, in years and merit then mature Be his companions in cternal bliss. Such was the substance; but in swelling phrase At large, full tide of poesy and zeal, Flow'd his high-ton'd, enthusiastic song. End of the First Book. BOOK the Second. Th' inspiring measures close. To arms, to arms, Innumerable mouths concurrent sound; To arms, to arms, reply the pillar'd isles Of Jove's Olympian temple: down his banks To distant Neptune glad Alph?us wafts The glorious clamour. Through th' assembly vast Meantime an elevated form is seen, With gracious gesture, animating look, Approaching: now before th' Elean thrones Of solemn judgment he majestic stands, Known for the man by Themis plac'd in rank Above his fellow mortals; archon once Of Athens, now an exile: him the chief Among the grave Hellanodics address'd: Hail, Aristides! On th' Olympian games Thy presence throws new dignity: what crown Can they provide to equal thy desert? While others court the prize of strength and skill, Activity and valour; in the lists Of virtue only Aristides strives. With him on earth competitor is none; Him Jove, sole perfect judge of gods and men, Can recompense alone. He scornful views Ambitious heroes, who assume the names Of thunder-bearers, vanquishers of towns, And ravagers of kingdoms: vain attempt In feeble man to imitate in pow'r Th' inimitable gods! On thee he casts An eye delighted; thee, by ev'ry tongue Proclaim'd the just; thee, emulating heav'n, Where mortals may, in goodness. Yet our voice Shall, what we can, decree dispraise to those Whose envy wrong'd that sacred head of thine. Forbear that censure, Aristides spake: Though liberty may err through jealous care, That jealous care far oft'ner saves a state Than injures private worth. That I forgave My condemnation, be my witness, Jove! Whom I, departing from my native soil, Implor'd that Athens ne'er might feel the loss Of Aristides. To confirm that pray'r I have employ'd my exile; not in quest Of splendid refuge in the courts of kings, But through each city with unwearied steps Have pass'd, exhorting, stimulating Greece To bold defence. I gladly am forestall'd Here by a noble countryman, whose arm At Marathon was fam'd, whose Attic lays Immortalize the brave. I now invoke, Not with less fervour, though in humbler phrase, The patriots there triumphant e'en in death, The manes of Leonidas, of all Whose gen'rous blood new-spilt in freedom's cause, ThermopylÃ¦ beholds, to spread abroad Their glorious spirit, and exalt your minds Above the sense of danger. Now the weal Of gen'ral Greece a gen'ral effort claims. March to the plain, ye Doric warriors! mount Your decks; th' Athenians with united arms Support, no longer in that isthmian fence Your trust reposing. Were the wall of brass, Were adamant the rampart, if the pow'r Of Athens, once extinguish'd, leave your coasts Defenceless, soon to Pelops' Isle the foe, Like death, a thousand avenues will find. He ceas'd: A second acclamation rends The sky; again th' Olympian temple groans In replication, and Alph?an banks Reverberate the sound. The Attic bard Meantime, o'er-spent with labour of the mind And voice loud straining, to the tranquil porch Of Jove is lightly borne; nor knows the hands, Benevolent and pious, which sustain His languid burden; till these friendly words In tones remember'd dissipate his trance. Doth Ãschylus forget me? O recal Melissa's brother, and OÃ¯leus' son, Whose Locrian hinds at one auspicious hour Assisted thy bold mariners to hurl Th' OetÃ¦an ruins on Barbarian heads. See MelibÅus off'ring to thy lip The stream's refreshing moisture.âSoon restor'd, Th' Athenian thus: Illustrious Medon, hail! How fares Melissa, how thy native land? She rests, I hope, on Oeta still secure, Returns the Locrian. When Laconia's king Was slain, and I, commanded to retreat, Charg'd with a solemn notice to her state, That he expir'd obedient to the laws; My life, devoted to avenge his blood, I sav'd. O'erpow'ring Xerxes soon reduc'd The Locrians, Dorians, ev'ry northern Greek. In time my father's treasure I remov'd, Which with a hundred followers I bore To LacedÃ¦mon. There indiff'rence cold I found to all except of Pelops' Isle; Attention sole to build an isthmian wall: Pausanias, guardian to the minor king, Son of divine Leonidas, disdains Our just complaint: The Ephori confine To this contracted region all their care, Save AÃ«mnestus. Gen'rous oft he mourn'd; In vain his torpid colleagues he reprov'd. Disgusted there, I join'd these solemn games, Where in contention of the warlike spear I prov'd a victor. Olive-bound, my head On future fields its freedom shall maintain; Else, with my late preserver's fate in view, Shall dying roll this chaplet in the dust. Repair with me to Athens, cries the bard. Sage is that counsel, Aristides near Subjoins: time presses; Ãschylus, embark: Ãgina's hospitable round supplies My place of rest.âNow swift th' Athenian band, With Medon's, seek their Delphian barks again; While Aristides holds an inland course, Still to his country meditating good, Of his own wrongs forgetful. As he roam'd From state to state, his eloquence instill'd The love of freedom, horror at her loss, Unchanging hatred to monarchal sway, With concord, valour, fortitude, and zeal For Greece in danger. From his wonted seat In heav'n, so PhÅbus, patient and resign'd, An exile wander'd on the earth below; Beneficent and helpful, there diffus'd His light of science; with salubrious skill Imparted health, and taught the varied use Of lenient roots and plants. The Delphian keels Meantime are loosen'd from El?an sands, With sails outstretch'd for Athens. On his couch Still Timon lies despairing; near him watch The chiefs humane: in kind officious care The Persian captive from his forehead wipes The dews of anguish. With a sudden start Him now the Delphian, erring, thus bespoke: Oh Alexander! thou hast lost, my son, Thy dear betroth'd, the land of Phocis lost Her noblest virgin! Reach my armsâI see The ravisher before me: though he frowns, Begirt with savage multitudes, my sword Shall reach his barb'rous heart. Here Medon turns To Ãschylus: The sight of Delphi's chief, So nobly excellent, so honour'd, lov'd, By all resorting to consult his god, A sight once grateful, pierces now my soul With agony. How oft hath music sooth'd Distemper'd bosoms! Let thy tuneful chords, Medicinally sweet, apply their aid. To him the bard: My harmony his ear But late rejected. MelibÅus, try The softer sounds which Pan hath taught the swains. A modulation by Melissa taught I will essay, th' obedient swain replies, He said, and lightly touch'd his warbling flute. Like fountains rilling, or mellifluous notes Of birds, a soft and lulling flow attun'd The ambient air. At first th' afflicted man Paus'd in attention, soon a trickling tear Bedew'd his beard; the remedy was chang'd To pain, and thus he recommenc'd his moan. Thou, Amarantha, too couldst wake the soul Of music, melting in thy parent's ear, Refining joyful seasons, or the hours Of care beguiling. In a foreign clime Hang up thy harp, sad captive! Let thy hand Forget her skill, nor charm Barbarian minds. But hark! I hear the ruffian. Slave! he calls, Resume thy harp: Some chosen hymn of Greece, Such as delighted PhÅbus, chaunt to me, Me now thy god. O Alexander, fly, Redeem thy love. Apollo, who couldst hurl Parnassian summits on a host of foes, Make me thy instrument of wrath! My nerves Convert to pierceless adamant; my lance Point with thy father's lightning! Me thy priest, Sprung from an old, heroic, sacred line, Thou shouldst avenge. But vengeance is too late; My daughter yields: a minstrel to her lord, To her deflow'rer, with obsequious art The Grecian chords she prostitutes, and smiles To see my suff'rings!âDuring this distress, With canvas press'd, the squadron bounds along By Coryphasium, by Messene's gulph In Nestor's Pylian kingdom, by the peak Of TÃ¦narus, projecting o'er a cave, Night's gloomy chamber, fabled to descend Low as Plutonian regions. Thrice the morn Serenely smil'd, ere Malea's top their sails O'ershades, Laconian promontory bleak, The residence of storms. Five distant masts Are now descried; when Ãschylus bespake The Locrian chief: Not friendly are those decks; Our navy, since ThermopylÃ¦ was forc'd, To Salamis retiring, leaves the foes At large to range the sea. Thy counsel give; To some Laconian harbour shall we steer, Or wait their coming? Here OÃ¯leus' son: Thou art my leader; thee propitious Mars On land and main with equal pow'rs endues: How can I counsel, stranger to the waves? At thy commandment to retreat, or fight, Behold me ready.âThen by Mars, replies The warrior bard, as no resistless force Bears down against us, yet insulting hoists A threat'ning signal, Delphians, rest the oar; Provide your arms; Athenians, Locrians, arm! This said, his pinnace, launch'd in haste, convey'd His orders round to form th' embattled line. Six were the vessels; Lo! a stately bark In regal pendants leads th' opponent van. As when a vernal sun's precarious beam Is intercepted by a sudden cloud, Whose turgid folds are overcharg'd with hail; Some palace, broad, impenetrably roof'd, Defies the clatt'ring, ineffectual drift, Which harmless melts awayâso flew a show'r Of missive arms, of arrows, javelins, darts, With pebbles whirling from the forceful sling, On Grecian helms and implicated shields; But innocently fell. Now side to side The chieftains grappled, and gigantic death To either deck outstretch'd his purple feet. Malignant art no engine hath devis'd To man destructive like his own fell hand In serried fight. But slaughter now began To pause in wonder, while the Asian chief, Whose blazon'd armour beam'd with gold, engag'd Cecropia's hardy vet'ran foot to foot, With falchion falchion, shield encount'ring shield. So, in the season when lascivious heat Burns in their veins, two branching-headed stags, Of all the herd competitors for sway, Long with entangled horns persist in strife, Nor yield, nor vanquish: stand in gaze the rest, Expecting which by conquest shall assume The mastery of all. Now Timon, rous'd With MelibÅus, and the captive youth, Starts from his pillow: they attain the poop, Which instant boarded from an eastern ship By hostile arms is held. Brave Medon quits His former station; Ãschylus he leaves A firm defender there: his falchion keen Aloft he waves. As some tremendous shark, Who with voracious jaws resistless foams Along the main, and finny tribes devours, Or drives before him on the sun-bright waves, Where late secure they wanton'dâMedon's might, Prevailing thus, the steerage heaps with dead; Though not in time victorious to retain Unhappy Timon, MelibÅus good, And Artamanes, not unwilling borne With them away to join his friends again. Two Delphian vessels their auxiliar beaks Present. More furious had the contest glow'd In ev'ry quarter; when o'er Malean cliffs The wind began to howl, the troubled sky To flash sulphureous, menacing a storm, Such as Saturnia on the Dardan fleet, Or Neptune's rage for Polyphemus blind Dash'd on LaÃ«rtes' much enduring son. The squadrons separate; To the shelt'ring lee Of Malea steer the Grecians; while their foes Expatiate o'er the roomy sea, to shun The local tumults of that stormy shore, And hold a distant course. O'er Timon's fate Th' Athenian now finds leisure to lament With Medon, Medon with responsive grief For MelibÅus. By return of dawn The waters calm'd invite the vigorous oars To recommence their progress. Coasting down Laconia's sea-beat verge, they wear the day; Then resting moor in Cynosura's port. From Ãschylus in sighs these accents broke: Here Ãsculapius by his pow'rful art, Which dar'd revive departed breath in man, Offending Pluto, thunder-pierc'd by Jove, Lodg'd his own clay in Cynosura's mold. O now to immortality preferr'd, Kind god of med'cine! wouldst thou hear my suit, Thou shouldst restore Leonidas, to warm Unfeeling Sparta; then thy Delphian sire The menac'd doom of Athens would revoke, Nor I besprinkle with indignant tears Laconia's shore. O Locrian guest, I call'd Thy welcome feet to Athens: thou mayst view (For so the oracle to me denounc'd) Her tow'rs in dust.âMinerva's tow'rs to fall Hath PhÅbus doom'd? the Locrian chief exclaim'd; I, who have lost my country, yet can find A tear for Athens: I attest the gods, As in one vessel, Ãschylus, we steer Together now, thy fortune I will share; And down her stream, howe'er the tempest roar, With thee embark'd, will never quit thy side. The tragic bard unbends his mournful brow, Thus answ'ring: Gen'rous Medon, I confess, Approaching nearer to my seat of birth, I dropp'd a tear of anguish; nature wept At sad forebodings of destruction there. But know, a true Athenian ne'er desponds: Abandon'd by allies, condemn'd by heav'n To see their city burnt, that gallant race Will yet assert their liberty; will save Ev'n faithless Sparta, and thy home redeem. This said, they slept, till morning gives her sign To weigh the anchors, and unfurl the sails. Aurora's third appearance tips with light, Of roseate tincture, spacious walls and tow'rs Of no ignoble city, rising clear From shading mists to view. The poet then: Lo! Medon, fair TrÅzene; rich her soil, Her people gen'rous, to Cecropia's state Inviolably faithful. See that isle Which fronts the port; redundant in delights Of art and nature, though of circuit small, Calauria shews her verdant round of wood. Here disembarking, with devotion pure We must invoke the trident-bearing god. This isle from PhÅbus Neptune in exchange For Delphi took. Thrice holy is the soil, Deserving rev'rence, by that pow'r belov'd, Who shar'd a third of ancient Saturn's reign, His son a brother to Olympian Jove. Here shall we greet some wonder of her sex, The sacerdotal maid. TrÅzene's laws One of her noblest daughters in her bud Establish here presiding, here confin'd To priestly functions, till the genial god Of marriage hence redeem her, grown mature For care less rigid, and a tend'rer tie. The heroes land, where opening to their sight An elevation of the ground, attir'd In flow'r-enamell'd turf, display'd the fane Of structure vast in marble: brass the gates Refulgence cast; a peristyle sustain'd The massy roof; huge columns on their heads The crisped foliage of acanthus bore, And high o'erlook'd th' impenetrable shade Which screen'd the island round. Perennial springs Supplied melodious currents through the woods, In artificial beds of pearly conchs Along the sea-beat margin cull'd by nymphs, The temple's chaste attendants. Unrestrain'd Here flow'd the native waters; there confin'd By marble fountains, win th' enchanted eye To shady-skirted lawns, to op'ning glades, Or canopies of verdure: all the founts Were grac'd by guardian images of gods, The train of Neptune.âLo! the gate is thrown Abroad; the priestess, lovely in her shape As virgin Thetis to the nuptial arms Of Peleus led, more blooming than the flow'rs Beneath her decent step, descends the slope: A matron staid behind her solemn treads; Close to her side, in radiant arms, a youth Who like a brother of the Graces moves. His head, uncas'd, discovers auburn locks Curl'd thick, not flowing: his sustaining hand She, rosy-finger'd, to her own admits. He seem'd Apollo, not with martial fires Such as on Titan's race he darted keen, But with th' enamour'd aspect which he wore When Clymene he won, or Daphne woo'd: She Cynthia, not a huntress, when the chace Of rugged boars hath flush'd her eager cheek, But gently stooping from an argent cloud, Illumining mount Latmus, while she view'd Her lov'd Endymion, by her magic pow'r Entranc'd to slumber.âÃschylus approach'd, To whom the youth: Great bard and warrior, hail! Whose valiant deeds on Artemisium's flood, In that first conflict with Barbarian fleets, I strove to copy: there was all my praise. Me TrÅzen's leader, from my post remote, Thou see'st: forbear to wonder, and attend. Thy Athens now is desolateârelax That anxious browâher constancy, her zeal For gen'ral freedom, elevate her name Beyond all triumphs. Her discerning chief, Themistocles, interpreting the words Of Pythian PhÅbus, prov'd that ships alone, The fleets of Athens, were the wooden walls Of refuge. All persuaded, sires and sons, With mothers, daughters, cheerfully forsook Their native roofs. Lo! Salamis o'erflows With your illustrious people; through her towns Ãgina swarms; to multitudes myself Have been conductor; in TrÅzenian homes, By cordial invitation, they reside. To each a daily stipend by a law They find allotted, schools with teachers fill'd, That not unletter'd from TrÅzene's walls The sons of learned Athens may depart, When victory to come rebuilds her tow'rs. With thee behold me ready to embark For Salamis again, where anchor'd lies The whole confederated fleet. I leave My Ariphilia, this my dear betroth'd, To fight my country's battles; but return, I trust in Mars, more worthy of her love: To her and Neptune I but now consign'd The most ennobled of Athenian dames. Ha! see on yonder beach the form divine Of Aristides, newly wafted o'er From TrÅzen: thither, not unbid, he came From his late virtuous progress, in our bounds Through willing minds sage counsel to diffuse, His own exterminated friends console. Cleander finish'd. Soon th' arrival known Of Aristides from the temple call'd The Attic dames, from ev'ry purlieu near, Who with their children in assembly throng Around him. Silent tears confess his loss To them and Athens. His benignant mold By sympathy had melted into grief; If wisdom, ever present in his soul, Had not his long-tried constancy upheld To their behoof. Environ'd by the troop Of lovely mourners, stood the godlike man Like some tall cedar, in a garden plac'd Where glowing tufts of flow'rs and florid plants Once bloom'd around; now, sear'd by scorching blasts, In faded colours pine. In look, in phrase Humane he spake: Be comforted, and hear My voice applaud Themistocles, my foe, Whose counsels have preserv'd you. But what praise Is yours, O glories of the tender sex! Who brave the floods, without a murmur leave Your native, dear abodes for public good! Ye ornaments of Greece, the pride and boast Of happy fathers, husbands, brothers, sons! As yet unseen, Euphemia from the rest Impatient stepp'd, his mother. At her sight, The best, the greatest of mankind inclines Before the authress of his being, low As some celestial to the rev'rend form Of Cybele, progenitrix of gods. Her aged arms extending, she began: Thy moderation aggravates the crime Of Athens. Son, remember, when thou bad'st Our household gods farewel, thy parting pray'r; That Athens never might regret the loss Of Aristides. Righteous man! then first The righteous pow'rs denied a pray'r of thine; Who with inflicted vengeance for thy wrong Have sorely taught Athenians to lament In thee their safety banish'd.âMother, cease, He quick replied; controul presumptuous thoughts; Let such uncomfortable words no more Be heard by these already plung'd in woe: It is Laconia, who her aid withholds, Cecropian tribes afflicts. But, noble dames, In this asylum sojourning a while, Trust your own merits, and a guardian god; The sons of Athens on his own domain He will exalt by conquest, soon transport Her daughters back to liberty and peace: From him that grace continue to deserve, By resignation to his brother Jove, Who loves the patient.âAs on lands adust By hot solstitial rays, when genial clouds, In season due unbosoming their stores Of kindly rain, new dress the pasture brown; Again the flowrets on the meadows spring; O'er meadows, fresh in verdure, youthful steeds, Led by the parent females, joyous bound, The heifers gambol, kids and lambkins dance, The birds in dripping bow'rs their plumes repair, And tune their choral, gratulating throatsâ So consolation from his blameless mouth, With looks benevolent, in soothing tones Relieves dejection. Soft composure smooths Each matron's forehead; virgins smile around; With sprightly feet the children beat the turf, Him as their father hail in shrill delight. Not so his own two daughters: infants young, A dying mother's pledge, Euphemia's charge, His side they leave not, clinging to his knees Like woodbines sweet about some stately tree: He kiss'd, he bless'd them, but controul'd his tears. Now tow'rds the bay with Ãschylus he turns; Cleander follows. Ariphilia mute Stands fix'd in tears; as Niobe, congeal'd By grief to marble, through its oozing pores Distill'd sad moisture, trickling down unheard. On Sipylus the nymphs, by pity call'd, The weeping rock environ'd; so the train, Who minister in Neptune's sacred dome, Inclose their priestess, whom her matron sage Leads from Cleander's oft reverted sight. End of the Second Book. BOOK the Third. O'er his own squadron soon TrÅzene's chief Hath reassum'd command; the rest embark Aboard the Delphian. Ãschylus then spake: To Salamis we hoist returning sails: Say, Aristides, shall my voice, of weight Among the tribes, solicit thy recal? Our country wants that helpful hand of thine. No, Aristides answers, this again Might waken faction; let the monster sleep. Themistocles directs united minds, In him confiding: not the stock reviv'd Of all Cecropia's heroes since her birth, Could like this union prop the Attic state. Brave too the son of Neocles, expert, Cool, politic; his talents will uphold The public safety for his own renown. May he enjoy a glory so acquir'd! My secret counsels from Ãgina's isle Shall not be wanting: for my country's sake, Which I forgive, him, author of my wrongs, My utmost efforts shall advance to same. The gulph Saronic now admits their keel. By Epidaurus coasting, they attain The cape of high SpirÃ¦um, which o'erlooks Ãgina. Guided by Aurora's light, Th' illustrious exile on that isle they land; Thence veering, steer for Salamis. These words Now break from Medon; Silent have I gaz'd On Aristides, shortly must behold Themistocles; Athenian friend, explain Between such men what cause produc'd their feuds. Their diff'rent merits, Ãschylus replied, Rais'd emulation in their younger days. A soldier's part they gallantly achiev'd In the same rank at Marathon; I saw, Admir'd their valour. For distinction high In pow'r and fame, Themistocles hath us'd His num'rous virtues; Aristides walk'd In virtuous paths, alone by virtue mov'd; For him his justice hath a title gain'd Of Just. The son of Neocles, inflam'd By envy, stirr'd the people's jealous fear Against his rival to assert a law, Where, by inscription of his name on shells, A citizen so potent, that his will Seems only wanting to subvert the state, Is by concurrence of six thousand hands Doom'd for ten years to absence from their bounds, Without disgrace or mulct. Among the tribes Themistocles hath since obtain'd a sway Which might incur the rigour of that law; Yet by the gods his influence supreme He at this crisis gallantly employs To save the public.âLift thy wond'ring eyes! The whole confederated fleet of Greece, Four hundred gallies, bulwark all the round Of Salamis: one animated mass That island shews; from swarms of either sex, And ev'ry age, dales, hillocks seem to heave With undulating motion.âHis discourse Clos'd with his voyage: on the furrow'd sands Of Salamis the vessels rest their keels; Where living waters from a copious spring Discharge their bubbling current. On a smooth, But gently-shelving green, pavilions rose; One from the rest sequester'd, under shade Of oaks above, was neighbour to the fane Of Telamonian Ajax, hero known At Troy: the Attic phalanx then he join'd, By Athens honour'd since with rites divine. This tent, by ensigns of command in front Adorn'd, Themistocles possess'd: alone He now remain'd; artificer sublime Of great expedients, in the greatest storms Which rock a state, he, politic and firm, In manly strife with fortune when she frown'd, Whene'er she smil'd her favour to secureâ He now, to feed his enterprising soul, Successes past enumerating sat, Thus in a glow of thought: While others dream'd Of rest and safety permanent in Greece, I from the day of Marathon presag'd The war begun, not finish'd; I, in time, Exhorted Athens to construct her fleet, A destin'd refuge; for the sail and oar, The shrouds and rudder, I her lusty youth Prepar'd; ere yet the Hellespont was bridg'd, I cur'd intestine feuds distracting Greece; When fate remov'd Leonidas from earth, My penetration, fathoming the depths Of ocean, like futurity foresaw Laconia's sloth; yet undismay'd I form'd The mighty plan to save th' Athenian state By yielding Athens to Barbarian flames. That I might plead the mandates of a god, I won, by secret gifts, the Pythian maid An oracle to render, which I fram'd; Th' interpretation to enforce, that ships Were wooden walls, Minerva's priest I gain'd Among the people to imprint belief By feign'd portents, and all religion's craft, That to the sea their deity was fled, Th' Acropolis deserting. Thus at will This restive, fierce democracy I sway For their salvation, and my own behoof In pow'r and lustre . . . . Interrupting here His eagle vanity in lofty soar, The warrior-poet and OÃ¯leus' son Appear. Serene and vacant he descends At once to affability and ease; As from his airy tow'r the lark, who strikes Heav'n's highest concave with his matin trill, His pinions shuts, and tranquil drops to earth. Of Aristides Ãschylus he knew The friend approv'd; him courteous he salutes: Thy eloquence and arms, the gen'rous toils Of Aristides too, have reach'd my ear By late intelligence. Thus far at least You have prevail'd; this navy is enlarg'd By squadrons new from various Grecian states. Is not this Medon? Honour'd in thy sire, More in thy own deservings, my embrace Accept; accept the welcome of this tent. Myronides now joins him, mighty chief! The destin'd scourge of Thebes; Xanthippus, soon At Mycale to conquer; in his hand Young Pericles, that future star of Greece; Then Cimon, fated on the land and main To gather palms in one triumphant day; Subaltern warriors to the prudent son Of Neocles. Saluting these, he spake: My gallant fellow-citizens, you come To learn the issue of this day's debate In gen'ral council. Wisely did we cede To Spartan Eurybiades command; The diff'rent squadrons to their native ports Had else deserted. Irksome, I confess, This acquiescence; but occasion looks Disdainful back on him who lets her pass; You have embrac'd her. Yielding to the Greeks, You fix their station here, the num'rous foe In narrow streights between Psyttalia's isle And Salamis to face. Can he possess, Who sees a treasure scatter'd on the ground, Unless he stoop? So prostrate in your sight Lies Greece, that precious treasure. Can you rule Before you save? On union safety grows. Resigning now an empty name of pow'r, Your moderation, winning grateful states, Will to your own a real sway procure Of long duration. LacedÃ¦mon's pride, Her best allies abandoningâa force Of ten weak vessels sparing to a fleet, Where Attic hands unfurl two hundred sailsâ Shall pay hereafter retribution full To you, Athenians, out of ashes rais'd From her to wrest ascendancy in Greece. Not sweetest music lulls the melting soul Beyond his artful eloquence, which soothes Their warm, their injur'd virtue. They reply: To thee, not Sparta, cheerful we submit, Our leader sole; thou judge and act for all. Now to his frugal Attic meal they sat; Where Ãschylus and Medon, each in turn Unfolding amply his adventures, won Attention: pleasing information charm'd Deluded time, till midnight prompted sleep. Thus, after labours past, the martial bard His countrymen rejoin'd. The hostile ships, Which gave him battle under Malea's cape, Veer'd for the streights EubÅan, where the fleet Of Asia moor'd. Subsiding on their way, The wind grants leisure for the Persian chief To view the captives. Artamanes steps Before the rest: on sight of Caria's queen, Great Artemisia, who commanded there, His cheek, with recollection of his sire To her so late persidious, reddens warm. She first to him: Argestes could behold Me worsted, long resisting adverse fate On fam'd ThermopylÃ¦'s disastrous field; My danger he enjoy'd: his rescued son, Whose growing merit wins observant eyes, I see with gladness; welcome to my deck! But who is he, disconsolate in mien? O rev'rend man of sorrows, lift thy head! From Artemisia no dishonour fear. He makes no answerâArtamanes, speak. The youth replies: His name is Timon, chief And priest in Delphi; on our inroad there, My brother, Mithridates, snatch'd away From his paternal breast a noble maid, An only child. His mind is darken'd since By frenzy; my compassion his distress Hath ever tended, servent now implores Thou wouldst commit him to my grateful care: Myself am debtor to indulgent Greeks. In smiles the princess answer'd: Gen'rous youth! Couldst thou protect him, I would trust thy care; But those deform'd by ignominious deeds May exercise in malice stronger pow'r Than thou in goodness: for the present lay Th' unhappy Delphian on a bed of rest. Beside her waits Aronces, high in trust, A hoary senior, freedman of her sire. On MelibÅus, on the queen, he fix'd Alternate looks; then earnest him address'd: O thou of noble frame, in lowly garb, Speak whence thou com'st, thy own, thy father's name. What region gave thee birth? Did nature print, Or some disaster, on thy cheek that mark? I am not curious from a slender cause. The swain replied: From nature I derive That mark; of parents, of my native seat, Within this breast no traces now survive; In childhood stol'n by pirates, I was sold (Heav'n there was gracious) to the best of mÃ¨n: Full thirty annual suns have since elaps'd. He oft appris'd me, that my infant lips In Grecian accents would repeat the names Of Lygdamis and Dirce; so I styl'd My sire and mother.âO imperial dame, Thyself the seed of Lygdamis, exclaim'd The ancient man. If circumstance be proof, He is thy brother, Haliartus, stol'n Within that period from thy father's tow'r Wash'd by the waves, that fair abode retir'd. Halicarnassus mourn'd the dire event. He is thy likeness. I, preserr'd to rule Thy father's household; I, whose faithful arms So oft the infant Haliartus bore, So oft with eyes delighted have perus'd That object dear, I never can forget That signal mark, coeval with his birth, Distinguishing thy brother.âPensive, mute, Uncertain rests the queen.âHe still proceeds: Behold thy son, Leander, melts in tears! It is the touch of nature hath unclos'd That tender spring.âTo him the regal dame: Old man, thou know'st I honour, I confide In thy untainted faith. All strange events, Dress'd in affecting circumstance, excite These soft emotions; such in ev'ry breast Should rise, but not decide. Pure truth is built Not on our passions; reason is her base. Him to accept my brother, needs more proof; But to his manly and ingenuous looks I render homage. Let him case his limbs In Carian steel, and combat near my side; Let deeds illustrate an exalted mind; Then, whether kin or alien to my blood, He like a brother shall obtain regard From Artemisia.âMelibÅus here: Endear'd to heroes of OÃ¯lean race, I claim with none alliance; I have liv'd With them in joy, from ignorance been rais'd By them to knowledge, from the lowly state Which heav'n's deciding providence ordain'd, To their deserv'd regard, my utmost wish. To them restore me; I request no more From deities or mortals. Case my limbs In Carian armour splendid as thy own, Ne'er shalt thou see me combat near thy side Against the Grecians. Place of birth, or blood Of noblest dye in kindred, quite estrang'd By time and fortune, I reject for Greece; Greece, my kind nurse, the guardian of my youth, Who for my tutors did her heroes lend. My dear affections all are center'd there, My gratitude, my duty.âBy the hand She grasps the gallant captive, and proceeds: Thy sentiments are noble, they bespeak The care of heroes; thy release my hopes Forbid, my tend'rest wishes; to constrain Thy presence here, while we assail thy friends, I scorn. Aronces, launch a nimble skiff; On him attendant, reach NicÃ¦a's walls, For him transport a suit of arms compelete; Nor let unhappy Timon want thy care. Thee, Greek or Carian, brother, friend, or foe, Whate'er thou prov'st hereafter, I will greet Again, my heart so prompts me; I require No plighted word, no token; ere we meet Once more at least, thou wilt not, I confide, Thou canst not harbour such a thought as flight From Artemisia.âMelibÅus look'd Integrity; he felt too full for words, And sees her thoughtful and perplex'd retire. Aronces now on Artamanes calls; With him, and either captive, he embarks; Of Carian arms he lodges on the poop A rich-emblazon'd suit. The pinnace light Along the shore, from ev'ry foe secure, Skims o'er the waters with distended sails, Swift as a vig'rous stag who hears no cry Of dogs or men, but o'er the champaign green Or valley sweeps, to glory in his speed And branching antlers. On the form and port Of MelibÅus long Aronces fed His eager eye, unsated with delight; At last he spake: My lord, NicÃ¦a's fort, A garrison of Xerxes, will afford A refuge kind, till Caria's queen her sail Of visitation hoists; the setting sun Will see my lord safe landed in the cove. That splendid title thou dost ill bestow On my condition, MelibÅus then. To whom Aronces: Oh thou art my lord, Thou art the son of Lygdamis! My heart, Old as I am, experienc'd in events, Without a cause to such excess of joy Would ne'er mislead me.âHonest hearts, rejoin'd The other, oft are credulous, and lead The mind to error; art thou sure, my friend, That I am no impostor, who hath heard Of Lygdamis and Dyrce, and apply Their names to falsehood?âHaliartus, no! Exclaims Aronces; I before me see My noble master, Lygdamis, restor'd; Such as he was when thou, his child, was lost. Oh! lend attentionâlo! the winds are still, The sea unruffled, while my tongue begins A tale which once with horror pierc'd my soul, But in thy hearing rapt'rous I repeat: Halicarnassus gave thy father birth, Her most illustrious citizen; with twins Thy mother's bed was bless'd; thy sister one, That Artemisia, glory of her sex, Bestow'd in marriage on the Carian king; Thou art the other. Oft thy sire abode Within a tow'r delightful, but remote, Wash'd by the billows; one disastrous day, As thou wast tripping on the silver sands, Thy nurse attending with some faithful slaves, A troop of pirates landed; all thy train Defending thee were kill'd, or wounded sunk Disabled on the beach; with various spoil, From those unguarded borders, they convey'd Aboard their vessels thee their richest prize. Aronces paus'd.âFrom Timon, listing by, This exclamation broke: My daughter too May be recover'd!âArtamanes here: Myself, redeem'd from capture, pledge my faith That I will struggle to restore thy child. Night dropp'd her dusky veil; the pinnace gain'd NicÃ¦a, Locrian fortress, seated nigh ThermopylÃ¦; ensuing morn proclaims, By shouts and clangour, an approaching host. That gate of Greece, by LacedÃ¦mon's king So well maintain'd, defenceless now admits Uncheck'd Barbarian inroads: thus a mound By art constructed to restrain the sea, Or some huge river's course, neglected long, And unsustain'd by vigilance and care, Affords a passage new to whelming floods, Whose surface hides fertility in waste; Till some sagacious architect oppose To nature's violence a skill divine, Prescribing where th' obedient wave shall flow. To his companions Artamanes spake, As in their sight, extended from a tow'r, ThermopylÃ¦ in torrents from its mouth Pours mingled nations: See Mardonius there, The son of Gobryas, author of this war, The flow'r of Asia's captains. At the time We first attack'd this pass, with num'rous bands, A distant range of Macedon and Thrace He was detach'd to ravage and subdue, Triumphant now returning. Friends, farewel! Him I must follow. Timon, may the light Of Mithra shine propitious on m days As I protect thy oaughter, and restore, If fate so wills, her spotless to thy arms. These words, relumining with hope, compos'd The clouded soul of Timon. Swift the youth, In vigour issuing through the portal, mix'd Among his native friends: a blithsome steer, At op'ning dawn deliver'd from the stall, Thus o'er the flow'ry pasture bounding, joins The well-known herd. Mardonius him receiv'd, Foe to Argestes, cordial to his son, Mardonius all-commanding, all in frame, In nervous limbs excelling, like that bull Who stemm'd the billows with his brawny chest, Who on his back of silver whiteness bore Europa's precious weight to Cretan strands, Himself a god transform'd. New martial pow'rs Are here from HÃ¦mus, from PangÃ¦an snows. A Greek in lineage, Alexander here, Young sov'reign o'er Barbarians, leads to war His Macedonian troops. To Athens bound By mutual hospitality, he lov'd That gen'rous city; now, by force compell'd, He arms against her. But persuasive love, The charms and virtues of a Grecian fair, Will wake remembrance of his Grecian race, To better counsels turn his youthful mind. That Asia's king was now advanc'd to Thebes, Intelligence is brought; this known, a steed Of swiftest pace Mardonius mounts; command To Tiridates delegatesâThy force Extend o'er Locris, o'er the Phocian bounds, Our conquests new. This giv'n in charge, he speeds, With no companion but Argestes' son, Nor other guard than fifty horsemen light, To greet the king. The second morning shews Cadmean Thebes, whose citadel was rais'd By stones descending from CithÃ¦ron's hill Spontaneous, feign'd in fables to assume A due arrangement in their mural bed At sweet Amphion's lute; but truth records, That savage breasts by eloquence he tam'd, By his instructions humaniz'd, they felt The harmony of laws and social ties. To him succeeded stern Agenor's son, PhÅnician Cadmus, he who letters brought From Tyre to Greece; yet ignorance o'erwhelm'd His generation; barbarous of heart, Obtuse of mind they grew; the suries there, There parricide and incest reign'd of old, Impiety and horror: more debas'd, They now for gold their liberty exchange; They court a tyrant, whose Barbaric host Flames round their bulwarks, harrows up their plain, Lays waste their plenty, drinks Asopus dry, Their swift Ismenus, and DircÃ¦an spring. End of the Third Book. BOOK the Fourth. The Persian host in readiness was held Ere dawn; Aurora sees the signal given; Now trumpets, clarions, timbrels mix their sounds; Harsh dissonance of accents, in the shouts Of nations gather'd from a hundred realms, Distract the sky. The king his march renews In all his state, collected to descend Precipitate on Athens; like the bird Of Jove, who rising to the utmost soar Of his strong pinions, on the prey beneath Directs his pond'rous fall. Five thousand horse, Caparison'd in streak'd or spotted skins Of tygers, pards, and panthers, form'd the van; In quilted vests of cotton, azure dyed, With silver spangles deck'd, the tawny youth Of Indus rode; white quivers loosely cross'd Their shoulders; not ungraceful in their hands Were bows of glist'ning cane; the ostrich lent His snowy plumage to the tissued gold Which bound their temples. Next a thousand steeds Of sable hue on argent trappings bore A thousand Persians, all select; in gold, Shap'd as pomegranates, rose their steely points Above the truncheons; gilded were the shields, Of silver'd scales the corselets; wrought with gems Of price, high-plum'd tiaras danc'd in light. In equal number, in resembling guise, A squadron follow'd; save their mail was gold, And thick with beryls edg'd their silver shields. In order next the Magi solemn trod. Pre-eminent was Mirzes; snowy white Their vestments flow'd, majestically pure, Rejecting splendour; hymning as they mov'd, They sung of Cyrus, glorious in his rule O'er Sardis rich, and Babylon the proud; Cambyses victor of Ãgyptian Nile, Darius fortune-thron'd; but flatt'ry tun'd Their swelling voice to magnify his son, The living monarch, whose stupendous piles Combin'd the Orient and Hesperian worlds, Who pierc'd mount Athos, and o'erpower'd in sight Leonidas of Sparta. Then succeed Ten coursers whiter than their native snows On wintry Media's fields; NicÃ¦an breed, In shape to want no trappings, none they wore To veil their beauty; docile they by chords Of silk were led, the consecrated steeds Of Horomazes, Sacred too a car, Constructed new of spoils from Grecian fanes, In splendour dazzling as the noontide throne Of cloudless Mithra, follow'd; link'd in reins, In traces brilliant overlaid with gems, Eight horses more of that surpassing race The precious burden drew; the drivers walk'd, None might ascend th' inviolable seat; On either side five hundred nobles march'd Uncover'd. Now th' imperial standard wav'd; Of Sanders wood the pedestal, inscrib'd With characters of magic, which the charms Of Indian wizards wrought in orient pearl, Vain talisman of safety, was upheld By twelve illustrious youths of Persian blood. Then came the king; in majesty of form, In beauty first of men, as first in pow'r, Contemplating the glory from his throne Diffus'd to millions round, himself he deem'd Not less than Mithra who illumes the world. The sons of satraps with inverted spears His chariot wheels attend; in state their sires, The potentates of Asia, rode behind; Mardonius absent, of the gorgeous train Argestes tower'd the foremost; following march'd A square battalion of a thousand spears, By Mithridates led, his eldest born; Him the lascivious father had depriv'd Of Amarantha; dangerous the flames Of vengeance darted from his youthful eye. Th' immortal guard succeeded; in their van Masistius, paragon of Asia's peers, In beauteous figure second to the king, Among the brave pre-eminent, more good Than brave or beauteous; to Mardonius dear, His counsellor and friend, in Xerxes' court Left by that gen'ral, while in Thrace remote, To counterpoise Argestes. Tried in arms, In manners soft, though fearless on the plain, Of tend'rest feelings, Mindarus, to love A destin'd captive, near Masistius rank'd; Ariobarzanes next, whose barb'rous mien Exemplified his fierceness. Last of horse, With Midias, pow'rful satrap, at their head, A chosen myriad clos'd the long array. From these were kept three hundred paces void; Promiscuous nations held their distant march Beyond that limit; numberless they roll'd, In tumult like the fluctuating sands, Disturb'd and buoyant on the whirling breath Of hurricanes, which rend the Libyan wastes. To Thebes descending, soon Mardonius learn'd That pioneers, with multitudes light-arm'd, Detach'd before the army, bent their course To Athens. On he speeds, rejecting food, Disdaining rest; till midnight Cynthia shews A vaulted hollow in a mountain's side; There in his clanging arms Mardonius throws His limbs for slight refreshment; by him lies Argestes' son; to pasture springing nigh, The troop dismiss'd their steeds, and slept around. To superstition prone from early age Was Gobryas' son; o'erheated now by toil, Yet more by thirst unsated of renown, His soul partakes not with her wearied clay In sleep repose; the cavern to her view Appears in vast dimension to enlarge, The sides retire, th' ascending roof expands, All chang'd to crystal, where pellucid walls Expose to sight the universe around. Thus did a dream invade the mighty breast Of that long matchless conqueror, who gave Italia's clime a spoil to Punic Mars, When on the margin of Iberus lay The slumb'ring chief, and eagerly to birth The vast conception of his pregnant mind Was struggling. Now Mardonius to himself Seems roving o'er the metamorphos'd cave; Orbicular above, an op'ning broad Admits a flood of light, and gentlest breath Of odorif'rous winds; amid the blaze, Full on the center of a pavement, spread Beyond whate'er portentous Ãgypt saw In Thebes or Memphis, Fame, presiding there, Gigantic shape, an amethyst entire, Sits on a throne of adamant. On strength Of pillars, each a topaz, leans the dome; The silver pavement's intervening space Between the circling colonnade and wall With pedestals of diamond is fill'd; The crystal circuit is comparted all In niches verg'd with rubies. From that scene The gloom of night for ever to expel, Imagination's wanton skill in chains Of pearl throughout the visionary hall Suspends carbuncles, gems of native light, Emitting splendour, such as tales portray, Where Fancy, winning sorceress, deludes Th' enchanted mind, rejecting reason's clue, To wander wild through fiction's pleasing maze. The oriental hero in his dream Feels wonder waking; at his presence life Pervades the statue; Fame, slow-rising, sounds Her trumpet loud; a hundred golden gates Spontaneous fly abroad; the shapes divine, In ev'ry age, in ev'ry climate sprung, Of all the worthies since recorded time, Ascend the lucid hall. Again she sounds A measure sweeter than the Dorian flute Of Pan, or lyre of PhÅbus; each assumes His place allotted, there transform'd is fix'd An adamantine statue; yet unfill'd One niche remains. To Asia's gazing chief The goddess then: That vacancy for thee, Illustrious son of Gobryas, I reserve. He thus exults: Bright being, dost thou grant To Persia triumphs through my conqu'ring spear? He said: that moment through the sever'd earth She sinks; the spacious fabric is dissolv'd; When he, upstarting in the narrow cave, Delivers quick these accents: Be renown My lot! O Fortune, unconcern'd I leave The rest to thee. Thus dauntless, ere his sleep Was quite dispers'd; but waken'd soon he feels Th' imperfect vision heavy on his mind In dubious gloom; then lightly with his foot Moves Artamanes; up he springs; the troop Prepare the steeds; all mount; Aurora dawns. The swift forerunners of th' imperial camp Ere long Mardonius joins, where Athens lifts Her tow'rs in prospect. Unexpected seen, Their mighty chief with gen'ral, cordial shouts They greet; their multitude, their transport, clear His heart from trouble. Soon Barbarian throngs With shading standards through Cephissus wade, Who, had his fam'd divinity been true, His shallow stream in torrents would have swoln Awhile, to save the capital of Greece, Superb in structure, long-disputed prize Between Minerva and the god of seas, Of eloquence the parent, source of arts, Fair seat of freedom! Open are the gates, The dwellings mute, all desolate the streets, Save that domestic animals forlorn, In cries awak'ning pity, seem to call Their masters home; while shrieking beaks of prey, Or birds obscene of night with heavy wings, The melancholy solitude affright. Is this the city whose presumption dar'd Invade the lord of Asia? sternly said Mardonius ent'ring; whither now are fled Th' audacious train, whose firebrands Sardis felt? Where'er you lurk, Athenians, if in sight, Soon shall you view your citadel in flames; Or, if retreated to a distant land, No distant land of refuge shall you find Against avenging Xerxes: yet I swear By Horomazes, if thy gallant race Have sacrific'd their country to contend With mightier efforts on a future day, Them I will honour, though by honour forc'd I must destroy. Companions, now advance; Unnumber'd hands to overturn these walls Employ; not Xerxes through a common gate Shall enter Athens; lay the ruins smooth, That this offending city may admit, In all his state, her master with his host In full array. His order is obey'd. Through smooth Ismenus, and Asopus clear, The royal host in slow procession led, Their first encampment on a district lodge, PlatÃ¦a's neighbour; that renown'd abode Of noblest Greeks was desert. In his tent The king by night requested audience grants To Leontiades, that colleague base Of Anaxander, traitor like himself To Sparta's hero. Xerxes thus he warns: Now be the king reminded of the rage Against his father, which PlatÃ¦a bore At Marathon; that recently she brav'd Himself in Oeta's pass; nor Thespia fought With less distinguish'd rancour: be inform'd, The first is near, the other not remote; Thy vengeance both deserve. Destroy their fields, Consume their dwellings; thy o'erflowing camp May spare a large detachment; I will go Their willing guide. Masistius present spake: O monarch, live for ever in the hearts Of conquer'd nations, as of subjects born; Associate clemency with pow'r, and all Must yield obedience: thou art master here, Treat thy new vassals kindly.âIn a frown Argestes: Shall the king with kindness treat Invet'rate foes and zealous friends alike? Shall undeserving Thespians, shall the race Of fell PlatÃ¦a, unprovok'd who stain'd, On Attic fields, her spear with Persian blood, To help detested Athens, shall they share The clemency of Xerxes, in despite Of this our Theban host, who faithful gives Such wholesome counsel? Sov'reign, when I brought Thy condescension late to Sparta's king, Among the grim assembly in his tent Diomedon, Demophilus, I saw, With Dithyrambus, men preferring death To amity with thee, commanders all Of these malignant cities.âXerxes here: Approving, Leontiades, thy words I hear; Masistius, thee my servant loves, Mardonius, always victor in my name; Yet learn at last, O satrap! who dost wear The fullest honours, to partake with me, What I inherit from Darius, hate Inflexible, inexpiable hate To Athens, hate to her confed'rates all. Go, Theban, chuse what nations of our host Thou dost prefer; thyself appoint their chief. I chuse the Caspians, Sacians; name for chief Brave Mithridates, great Argestes' heir, Rejoins the traitor. These ferocious most He best approv'd, and Mithridates chose, Among the youth most vigorous and fell In acts of blood. To hear Mardonius prais'd, Argestes, dreading his return, conceiv'd A pain, yet temper'd by a secret joy He felt arise; who, rival of his son, Long wish'd him distant from the guarded roof Where Timon's daughter was confin'd. Dismiss'd To rest, all separate. They renew their march By day-spring; Leontiades, to wreak On hapless Thespia and PlatÃ¦a's walls The hate implacable of Thebes; the king, With equal rage, to spoil Minerva's reign. Her olive groves now Attica disclos'd, The fields where Ceres first her gifts bestow'd, The rocks whose marble crevices the bees With sweetness stor'd; unparallel'd in art Rose structures, growing on the stranger's eye, Where'er it roam'd delighted. On like Death, From his pale courser scatt'ring waste around, The regal homicide of nations pass'd, Unchaining all the furies of revenge On this devoted country. Near the banks Of desolate Cephissus halting sat The king; retarding night's affrighted steeds, The conflagration wide of crumbling tow'rs, Of ruin'd temples, of the crackling groves, Of villages and towns, he thence enjoy'd, Thence on the manes of Darius call'd: Son of Hystaspes! if the dead can heat, Thou didst command thy servants to remind Thy anger daily of th' Athenian race, Who insolently plough'd the eastern waves, Thy shores affronted with their hostile beaks, And burnt thy town of Sardis; at my call, Ghost of my father! lift thy awful brow; Rememb'ring now th' Athenians, see thy son On their presumptuous heads retaliate flames: Depriv'd of burial, shall their bodies leave Pale spectres here to wail their city fall'n, And wander through its ruins.âClosing here His barb'rous lips, the tyrant sought his couch. Thy summits now, Pentelicus, and thine, Haunt of sonorous bees, Hymettus sweet! Are ting'd with orient light. The Persian host Renew their progress; Athens soon receives Their floating banners and extended ranks Smooth o'er the fosse, by mural ruins fill'd. As from a course of ravage, in her den Of high CithÃ¦ron plung'd the monster Sphinx Her multifarious form, preparing still For havoc new her fangs and talons dire; Till her enigma Laius' son resolv'd, Whence desperation cast her headlong down The rocky steep; so, after thy carcer Of devastation, Xerxes, rest awhile Secure in Athens, meditating there Fresh woes to men. Than Oedipus more wise, Th' interpreter of oracles is nigh; Soon will the son of Neocles expel Thee from thy hold, by policy too deep For thy barbarian council to explore. Before the PrytanÃ¦um stops the car. Now savage bands inclose that rev'rend seat Of judgment; there Mardonius waits. The king, Pleas'd with his care, salutes him: Thou hast long Sweat under harness in th' eternal snows Of Macedon and Thracia, hast my name There dress'd in ample trophies; but thy speed, Preventing my arrival, is unknown To wings of eagles, or the feet of stags. Mardonius answers: Ever live the king To find his servant's zeal outstrip in speed The swiftest eagle, or the fleetest stag! Descend, thou lord of Athens! destin'd soon To universal sway.âThey climb the steps; Alone Argestes follows. In the hall These words of high import Mardonius spake: My liege, the season calls for quick resolves; By thee entrusted with supreme command, When thou art absent, to Phaleron's port, Late arsenal of Athens, all the ships I order'd from EubÅa; they below Lie well equipp'd and shelter'd, nor remote The whole united armament of Greece At Salamis. With Ariabignes great, Thy royal brother, and for merit nam'd Thy ruling admiral, the kings of Tyre, Of Sidon, Caria's princess, and the rest, I held a council; they concurr'd to fight, And by one effort terminate the war, All but the queen, from whose ingenuous mouth Will I, though differing, faithfully relate Each argument, each wordââMardonius, tell âThe king,â she said, âwhat peril I foresee âFrom this attempt; his ships defeated leave âHis host endanger'd; ever bold, the Greeks âAre desp'rate now; the want of sustenance âWill soon disperse them to their sev'ral homes; âThe sea's entire dominion to the king âWill then be left; whole armies then embark'd âThrough inlets free may pour on Pelops' Isle, âWhose coast I newly have explor'd with care. âMardonius, thou art eager; do not trust âIn multitude; full many in the fleet âAre false, are cowards. Let our sov'reign shun âPrecipitation; short delay at least âIs safe; a naval combat lost, is bane.â A greater bane delay, Argestes here; Who reading artful in the royal eye Determination for a naval fight, His malice thus on Artemisia vents: My liege forgets that Caria's queen derives Her blood from Grecian fountains; is it strange She should confine thy formidable hand, And so preserve her kindred?âStern the king: Though I reject her counsel to forbear The fight, none better will that fight sustain Than she, whose zeal, fidelity approv'd, And valour, none can equal but the son Of Gobryas. Go, Mardonius, see the fleet Prepar'd by morning; let Argestes burn The citadel and temples; I confer On him that office.âUtt'ring this, he turn'd Apart; forlorn Argestes hence presag'd Decline of regal favour, cent'ring all In Gobrya's son, who fiercely thus pursued: Thou hear'st the king; now hear a soldier's tone: Of old I know thee slanderer of worth; And I, distinguish'd by a late success, To envious eyes no welcome guest return. Thou canst traduce the absent, whom thy tongue Would flatter present. Not in Susa's court, Amid the soft security of peace, We languish now; great Xerxes on the stage Of glorious war, amid the din of arms, Can hear thy coz'ning artifice no more. Oh that he ne'er had listen'd! Asia's lord, When to a Tyrian trafficker demean'd, He barter'd for his glory. By my sword, Leonidas, preferring fame to sway O'er proffer'd Greece, was noble! What thy part, Who tamely proff'ring wast with scorn dismiss'd? Go, burn the fanes! Destruction is thy joy. He said, departing swiftly; on his way Meets Artamanes, meritorious youth, Who, not resembling an unworthy sire, Had fix'd th' esteem of that illustrious man. To him Mardonius: Brave Autarctus greet In words like theseâExalted to the bed Of bright Sandauce, sister of thy king, Now is the season to approve thy worth. Collect ten thousand warriors on the strand Which faces Salamis; an island near, Psyttalia nam'd, possess; ere long the foes Against her craggy border may be driven; Let spoils and captives signalize thy zeal. Thou, Artamanes, must attend him there, Nor let me want intelligence. Farewel! This mandate giv'n, the active chief proceeds With steps impatient to Phaleron's port. End of the Fourth Book. BOOK the Fifth. The sun was set; Autarctus and his band, In haste collected, through nocturnal shades To small Psyttalia pass'd a narrow frith. As on a desert forest, where at night A branching oak some traveller hath climb'd To couch securely; if the trunk beset By famish'd wolves in herd, who thirst for blood, Pale morn discovers to his waking sight, His hair in terrour bristles, pants his breast In doubt of safety; thus Aurora shew'd The unexpected gleam of Persian arms, Which fill'd Psyttalia, while the Attic strand, With numbers equal to its sandy stores Was cover'd, and Phaleron's road with masts, A floating forest, crowded like the pines, Majestic daughters of the Pcntic woods. Fair Athens burn'd in sight; embodied smoke Rose mountainous, emitting pillar'd flames, Whose umber'd light the newly-dawning sun But half eclips'd. At intervals are heard The hollow sound of columns prostrate laid, The crash of levell'd walls, of sinking roofs In massy ruin. Consternation cold Benumbs the Greek spectators, all aghast Except th' Athenians, whose unshaken minds To this expected fate resign'd their homes For independence. Gigantean rang'd From ship to ship Despair; she drives ashore The timid leaders, changing late resolves For gen'rous combat into base retreat. To seek the shelter of their native ports They clamour loud; the admiral convenes A council; him Themistocles address'd: Now Eurybiades, to whose command I voluntary yielded, from thy charge, Not less for Athens than for gen'ral Greece, I claim a righteous and heroic part, The promis'd fight in these auspicious streights, Which, rend'ring vain the multitude of foes, Assure success. But separate this fleet, A hundred openings may Barbarians chuse To Pelops' region; not on ev'ry spot An isthmian wall is plac'd. Depriv'd of all, If to your succour we Athenians lose All claim, ye Greeks, be valiant for yourselves! See Attica in slames, the temples raz'd, The tombs defac'd, the venerable dust Of our forefathers scatter'd in the wind! Would you avoid calamities like these, To sound instruction lean; th' almighty gods Wise counsels bless with prosperous events, To its own folly wilful blindness leave. Proud Adimantus, on his birth elate, The admiral of Corinth, envying long Cecropia's name and pow'r, arose and spake: For public safety when in council meet Men who have countries, silence best becomes Him who hath none; shall such presume to vote, Too patient Spartan, nay to dictate here, Who cannot tell us they possess a home? For Attica in flames, her temples raz'd, Her tombs disfigur'd, for th' ignoble dust Of thy forefathers scatter'd in the wind, Thou low-born son of Neocles, must Greece Her welfare hazard on a single day, Which, unsuccessful, endless ruin brings? Cleander heard, TrÅzene's youthful chief; Warm was his bosom, eloquent his tongue, Strong-nerv'd his limbs, well exercis'd in arms; Preventing thus Themistocles, he spake: Though blood, Corinthian, be of noblest dye, Base-born the soul when folly is her sire. Absurdity and malice no reply Deserve from thee, Athenian! thee, more wise, More valiant, more distinguish'd in thyself, Than all the vaunted progeny of gods. Did you not mourn, ye deities, to see A nation, you created with their soil, Forsake that ancient land? or not admire Your greatest work, the conduct of that man, Who such a race from such endearing homes, Wives, husbands, elders, infants, maidens, youths, In gen'rous quest of liberty could lead? Do you not look indignant down to hear Such venomous reproaches on his worth, A wrong to Greece? Her saviour him I call, As yet, I trust, his dictates will prevail. While he declaim'd, Themistocles, who scorn'd The insolent Corinthian, sat and scann'd The looks of all; his penetrating sight Could read the thoughts of men; the major part He saw averse to battle, Sparta's chief Uncertain, cold, and slow. Affecting here Decisive looks, and scorn of more debate, Thus brief he clos'd: Athenians still possess A city buoyant on two hundred keels. Thou, admiral of Sparta, frame thy choice; Fight, and Athenians shall thy arm sustain; Retreat, Athenians shall retreat to shores Which bid them welcome, to Hesperian shores, For them by ancient oracles reserv'd, Safe from insulting foes, from false allies, And Eleutherian Jove will bless their flight: So said your own Leonidas, who died For public welfare. You that glorious death May render, Spartans, fruitless to yourselves. This said, he left the council; not to fly, But with his wonted policy compel The Greeks to battle. At a secret cove He held in constant readiness a skiff, In Persian colours mask'd; he there embark'd The most entrusted of his household, charg'd With these instructions: Now return my love, Sicinus, born a Persian, of my house Not as a slave long habitant, but friend, My children's tutor, in my trust supreme. To Xerxes' navy sail; accost her chief In words like theseâThemistocles, who leads Athenian squadrons, is the monarch's friend, Approv'd by this intelligence; the Greeks In consternation shortly will resolve To separate and fly; let Asia's fleet Her numbers round in diligence extend, Investing ev'ry passage; then, consus'd, This whole confederated force of Greece Will sooner yield than fight, and Xerxes close At once so perilous a war.âHe ceas'd. Meanwhile the council wasted precious hours, Till Eurybiades at length alarm'd Lest all th' Athenians should retreat incens'd, Postpon'd the issue to th' ensuing day. Themistocles, retiring to his tent, There found his wife; his stratagem on wings Of execution, left his mind serene; Relax'd in thought, he trifled with his boy, Young child, who playful on the mother's lap, Soon as of Xerxes earnest she enquir'd, With frowning graces on his brow of down, Clench'd fast his infant hands. The dame pursues: O that the Greeks would emulate this child, Clench fast their weapons, and confront the foe! Did we abandon our paternal homes, Our nuptial chambers, from the cradle snatch Our helpless babes? Did tender maidens join Unanimous the cry, âEmbark, embark âFor Salamis and freedom!â to behold The men debating (so the Attic wives Are told) uncertain if to fight or serve? Who are the cowards, rather traitors, say? We will assail them, as the Trojan dames Did Polymestor, royal thief, who broke The holiest ties for gold.âTake comfort, love; All shall be well, Themistocles replied. Yes, I in thee have comfort, she proceeds; Thou canst devise some artifice to urge Ev'n dastards on; Sicinus thou hast sent, I ask not whither.âIn a smile her lord: With thy permission, then, the gods remain My confidents: to ease thee, I proclaim This boy the first of Greeks; he governs thee, Thou me, I Athens; who shall govern Greece, As I am sure to circumvent the foes. Retiring, seek the town; console the dames; Thy husband never was so high in hope. She pleas'd, departing, spake: To govern thee Requires an art which never woman knew, Nor man; most artful, thou controllest all, Yet call'st, nay often seem'st, thyself controll'd. She distant, thus he meditates alone: True, when I seem controll'd by others most, Then most assur'd my enterprize succeeds. O lib'ral nature! science, arts acquir'd, I little value; while thy light supplies Profuse invention, let capricious chance With obstacles and dangers gird me round, I can surmount them all; nor peace, nor war, Nor all the swift vicissitudes of time, E'er gave emergency a birth too strong For me to govern. On this crisis hangs My future greatness; whether joy or grief Shall close the term of being, none foreknow; My penetrating spirit I will trust Thus far prophetic; for a time, at least, I will possess authority and pow'r To fix a name enduring like the sun. Thus, in his own strong faculties secure, To rest he tranquil sunk, and slept till dawn; Then early rose. Advancing from the shore, A manly figure he observes, the face Wrapt in a mantle; as dividing clouds Reveal th' unmuffled sun, the mantle cast Aside discovers the majestic front Of Aristides, who the silence breaks: Dissensions past, as puerile and vain, Now to forget, and nobly strive who best Shall serve his country, Aristides warns His ancient foe Themistocles. I hear Thou giv'st the best of councils, which the Greeks Reject, through mean solicitude to fly; Weak men! throughout these narrow seas the foe Is station'd now, preventing all escape. Themistocles, though covetous of fame, Though envying pow'r in others, was not bred In horrid deserts, not with savage milk Of tigers nurs'd, nor bore a ruthless heart. He thus replied: With gratitude this foe Accepts thy welcome news, thy proffer'd aid, Thy noble challenge; in this glorious race Be all our strife each other to surpass. First know my inmost secrets; if the streights Are all invested with Barbarian ships, The act is mine; of our intended flight I through Sicinus have appris'd the foes; Of his success thee messenger I hail. The exile then: Such policy denotes Themistocles; I praise, the Greeks have cause To bless, thy conduct; teach me now what task I can achieve; to labour, to advise With thee commanding, solely to enjoy The secret pleasure of preserving Greece, Is my pursuit; the glory all be thine. Before the council shew that honour'd face, Rejoins the chief; report thy tidings there. To preparation for immediate fight Exhort; such notice they would slight in me, In thee all men believe.âThis said, they mov'd. Them on their way Myronides approach'd, Xanthippus, Cimon, Ãschylus, and all The captains, fixing reverential eyes On Aristides; this the wary son Of Neocles remark'd; he gains the town Of Salamis, the council there is met; To them th' illustrious exile he presents, At whose appearance all th' assembly rise, Save Adimantus; fast by envy bound, He sits morose; illib'ral then the word, As Aristides was in act to speak, Thus takes: BÅotia, Attica reduc'd, The Dorians, Locrians, you already know; To me this morn intelligence arriv'd, That Thespia, that Platea were in flames, All Phocis conquer'd; thus alone of Greece The Isle of Pelops unsubdued remains. For what is lost, ye Grecians, must we face Such mightier numbers, while barbarian hate Lurks in Psyttalia, watching for the wrecks Of our defeated navy? Shall we pause Now at the Isthmus with united force To save a precious remnant? Landing there, Your sailors turn to soldiers, oars to spears; The only bulwark you have left, defend. Then Aristides: Ignominious flight Necessity forbids; Ãgina's shore Last night I left; from knowledge I report. The hostile navy bars at either mouth The narrow streight between Psyttalia's Isle And Salamis, where lie your anchor'd ships. But shall the Greeks be terrified? What more Can they solicit of propitious heav'n, Than such deluded enemies to face, Who trust in numbers, yet provoke the fight Where multitude is fruitless?âClosing here, The unassuming exile straight retir'd. Cleander ent'ring heard; while Corinth's chief, Blind with malignity and pride, pursued: Her strength must Greece for Attica destroy'd Waste on the credit of a single tongue, From Athens banish'd? Swift Cleander spake: Is there in Greece who doubts that righteous tongue, Save Adimantus? To suspect the truth Of that illustrious exile, were to prove Ourselves both false and timid. But enough Of altercation; from the fleet I come, The words of Aristides I confirm; Prepare to fight; no passage have our ships But through embattled foes.âThe council rose. In this tremendous season, thronging round Th' accomplish'd son of Neocles, their hopes In his unerring conduct all repose. Thus on Olympus round their father Jove The deities collected, when the war Of earth's gigantic offspring menac'd heav'n, In his omnipotence of arm and mind Confiding. Eurybiades supreme In title, ev'ry leader speeds to act What great Themistocles suggests; himself, In all expedients copious, seeks his wife, Whom he accosts, encircled where she stood With Attic dames: Timothea, now rejoice! The Greeks will fight; to-morrow's sun will give A glorious day of liberty to Greece. Assemble thou the women; let the dawn Behold you spread the Salaminian beach; In your selected ornaments attir'd, As when superb processions to the gods Your presence graces, with your children stand Encompass'd; cull your fairest daughters, range Them in the front; alluring be their dress, Their beauties half discover'd, half conceal'd; As when you practise on a lover's eye, Through that soft portal to invade the heart; So shall the faithful husband from his wife Catch fire, the father from his blooming race, The youthful warrior from the maid he loves: Your looks will sharpen our vindictive swords. In all the grace of polish'd Athens thus His charge pronouncing, with a kind embrace He quits her bosom, nor th' encircling dames Without respectful admonition leaves To aid his consort. Grateful in itself A task she soon begins, which pleases more As pleasing him. A meadow fresh in green, Between the sea-beat margin and the walls, Which bore the island's celebrated name, Extended large; there oft the Attic fair In bevies met; Themistocles the ground To them allotted, that communion soft, Or pastime, sweetly cheating, might relieve The sad remembrance of their native homes. Here at Timothea's summons they conven'd In multitude beyond the daisies, strewn Thick o'er the verdure from the lap of spring, When most profuse. The wives, the mothers here Of present heroes, there in bud are seen The future mothers of immortal sons, Of Socrates, of Plato, who to birth Had never sprung if Xerxes had prevail'd, Or would have liv'd Barbarians. On a mount Timothea plac'd, her graceful lips unclos'd: Ye wives, ye mothers, and ye fair betroth'd, Your husbands, sons, and suitors claim that aid You have to give, and never can so well. A signal day of liberty to Greece Expect to-morrow; of the glorious scene Become spectators; in a bridal dress, Ye wives, encompass'd with your tender babes, Ye rev'rend matrons in your sumptuous robes, As when superb processions to the gods Your presence graces; but ye future brides, Now maids, let all th' allurement of attire Enhance your beauties to th' enamour'd eye: So from the face he loves shall ev'ry youth Catch fire, with animating passion look On her, and conquer. Thus Cecropia's maids, Who left their country rather than abide Impure compulsion to Barbarian beds, Or ply the foreign loom with servile hands, Shall live to see their hymeneal morn; Bless'd in heroic husbands, shall transmit To late posterity the Attic name. And you, whose exemplary steps began Our glorious emigration, you shall see Your lords, your sons, in triumph to your homes Return, ye matronsâOr with them will die, If fortune frown, Laodice aloud; For this I hold a poniard; ere endure A Persian yoke, will pierce this female heart. Enthusiastic ardour seems to change Their sex; with manlike firmness all consent To meet Timothea there by early dawn In chosen raiment, and with weapons arm'd, As chance should furnish. Thus Timothea sway'd, The emulator of her husband's art, But ne'er beyond immaculate intent; At her suggestion interpos'd her friend Laodice, the consort young and fair Of bold Aminias, train'd by naval Mars, From the same bed with Ãschylus deriv'd. TrÅzene's leader, passing by, admir'd The gen'rous flame, but secretly rejoic'd In Ariphilia at Calauria safe; He to thy tent, Themistocles, was bound. Thee to Sicinus list'ning, just return'd From his successful course, Cleander found, Thee of thy dear Timothea first inform'd, While thou didst smile applause. The youth pursued: From Aristides I deputed come; He will adventure from Psyttalia's isle This night to chace the foe, if thou concur In help and counsel: bands of Attic youth, Superfluous force excluded from the fleet, With ready arms the enterprize demand; Them, with his troop, OÃ¯lean Medon joins. A noble Grecian, sage, experienc'd, brave, Returns the chief; my answer is concise: Sicinus, fly! their pinnaces and skiffs Command th' Athenian vessels to supply At Aristides' call; th' attempt is wise, Becoming such a soldier; thou remain With him, to bring me tidings of success. Swift as a stone from Balearic slings, Sicinus hastens to th' Athenian fleet; Cleander light th' important order bears To Aristides, whose exalted voice Collects the banding youth. So gen'rous hounds The huntsman's call obey; with ringing peals Their throats in tune delight Aurora's ear; They pant impatient for the scented field, Devour in thought the victims of their speed, Nor dread the rav'nous wolf, nor tusky boar, Nor lion, king of beasts. The exile feels Returning warmth, like some neglected steed Of noblest temper, from his wonted haunts Who long hath languish'd in the lazy stall; Call'd forth, he paws, he snuffs th' enliv'ning air, His strength he proffers in a cheerful neigh To scour the vale, to mount the shelving hill, Or dash from thickets close the sprinkling dew. He thus to Medon: Of Psyttalia's shore That eastern flat contains the Persian chief, Known by his standard; with four thousand youths Make thy impression there; the western end Our foes neglect, a high and craggy part; But nature there through perforated rock Hath left a passage, with its mouth above Conceal'd in bushes; this, to me well known, I will possess; thence rushing, will surround The unsuspecting Persian. Darkness falls; Let all embark; at midnight ply the oar. They hear and march; allotted seats they take Aboard the skiffs Sicinus had prepar'd, Impatient waiting, but impatience keeps Her peace. The second watch is now elaps'd, That baneful season, mark'd in legends old, When death-controlling sorcery compell'd Unwilling spirits back to mortal clay Entomb'd, when dire Thessalian charmers call'd Down from her orb the pallid queen of night, And hell's tremendous avenues unclos'd; To Asia's mothers now of real bane, Who soon must wail ten thousand slaughter'd sons. The boats in order move; full-fac'd the moon Extends the shadows of a thousand masts Across the mirror of cerulean floods, Which feel no ruffling wind. A western course With his division Aristides steers, The Locrian eastward; by whose dashing oars A guard is rous'd, not timely to obstruct His firm descent, yet ready on the strand To give him battle. Medon's spear by fate Is wielded; Locrians and Athenians sweep The foes before them; numbers fresh maintain Unceasing conflict, till on ev'ry side His reinforcement Aristides pours, And turns the fight to carnage: by his arm Before a tent of stately structure sinks Autarctus brave in death. The twilight breaks On heaps of slaughter; not a Persian lives But Artamanes, from whose youthful brow The beaver sever'd by th' auspicious steel Of Medon, shew'd a well-remember'd face; The Locrian swift embrac'd him, and began: Deserve my kindness by some grateful news Of MelibÅus and the Delphian priest; Not Ãschylus in pity shall exceed My care in this thy second captive state. His grateful news the Persian thus repeats: NicÃ¦a, fort of Locris, them contains; Though pris'ners, happy in the guardian care Of Artemisia. What disastrous sight! Autarctus there lies prostrate in his blood. Oh, I must throw me at the victor's feet! He went, by Medon introduc'd, to kneel; Forbid by Aristides, he began: My own compassion to solicit yours, Without disgrace might bend a satrap's knee; I have a tale of sorrow to unfold, Might soften hearts less humaniz'd and just Than yours, O gen'rous Grecians! In that tent The widow'd wife of this late envied prince, Young, royal matronâtwenty annual suns She hath not toldâthree infants . . . At these words The righteous man of Athens stays to hear No more; he gains the tent, he enters, views Sandauce, silent in majestic woe, With her three children in their eastern vests Of gems and gold; urbanity forbids To interrupt the silence of her grief; Sicinus, waiting nigh, he thus enjoins: Thou, born a Persian, from a ghastly stage Of massacre and terrour these transport To thy own lord, Themistocles; the spoils Are his, not mine. Could words of comfort heal Calamity thus sudden and severe, I would instruct thy tongue; but mute respect Is all thy pow'r can give, or she receive. Apprise the gen'ral that Psyttalia's coast I will maintain with Medon, from the wrecks To save our friends, our enemies destroy. He then withdraws; Athenians he commands Autarctus' body to remove from sight; When her pavilion now Sandauce leaves, Preceded by Sicinus. On the ground She bends her aspect, not a tear she drops To ease her swelling heart; by eunuchs led, Her infants follow; while a troop of slaves, With folded arms across their heaving breasts, The sad procession close. To Medon here Spake Artamanes: O humane! permit Me to attend this princess, and console At least, companion of her woes, bewail A royal woman from Darius sprung. Him not a moment now his friend detains; At this affecting season he defers Enquiry more of MelibÅus, known Safe in NicÃ¦a; Persia's youth departs; The mournful train for Salamis embark. End of the Fifth Book. BOOK the Sixth. Bright pow'r, whose presence wakens on the face Of nature all her beauties, gilds the floods, The crags and forests, vine-clad hills and fields, Where Ceres, Pan, and Bacchus in thy beams Rejoice; O Sun! thou o'er Athenian tow'rs, The citadel and fanes in ruin huge, Dost rising now illuminate a scene More new, more wondrous, to thy piercing eye, Than ever time disclos'd. Phaleron's wave Presents three thousand barks in pendants rich; Spectators, clust'ring like Hymettian bees, Hang on the burden'd shrouds, the bending yards, The reeling masts; the whole Cecropian strand, Far as Eleusis, seat of mystic rites, Is throng'd with millions, male and female race Of Asia and of Libya, rank'd on foot, On horses, camels, cars. Ãgaleos tall, Half down his long declivity where spreads A mossy level, on a throne of gold Displays the king environ'd by his court In oriental pomp; the hill behind, By warriors cover'd, like some trophy huge Ascends in varied arms and banners clad; Below the monarch's feet th' immortal guard, Line under line, erect their gaudy spears; Th' arrangement, shelving downward to the beach, Is edg'd by chosen horse. With blazing steel Of Attic arms encircled, from the deep Psyttalia lifts her surface to the sight, Like Ariadne's heav'n-bespangling crown, A wreath of stars; beyond, in dread array, The Grecian fleet, four hundred gallies, fill The Salaminian streights; barbarian prows In two divisions point to either mouth Six hundred brazen beaks of tow'r-like ships, Unwieldy bulks; the gently-swelling soil Of Salamis, rich island, bounds the view. Along her silver-sanded verge array'd, The men at arms exalt their naval spears Of length terrific. All the tender sex, Rank'd by Timothea, from a green ascent Look down in beauteous order on their sires, Their husbands, lovers, brothers, sons, prepar'd To mount the rolling deck. The younger dames In bridal robes are clad; the matrons sage In solemn raiment, worn on sacred days; But white in vesture like their maiden breasts, Where Zephyr plays, uplifting with his breath The loosely-waving folds, a chosen line Of Attic graces in the front is plac'd; From each fair head the tresses fall, entwin'd With newly-gather'd flowrets; chaplets gay The snowy hand sustains; the native curls, O'ershading half, augment their pow'rful charms; While Venus, temper'd by Minerva, fills Their eyes with ardour, pointing ev'ry glance To animate, not soften. From on high Her large controlling orbs Timothea rolls, Supassing all in stature, not unlike In majesty of shape the wife of Jove, Presiding o'er the empyreal fair. Below, her consort in resplendent arms Stands near an altar; there the victim bleeds, The entrails burn; the fervent priest invokes The Eleutherian pow'rs. Sicinus comes, Sandauce follows; and in sumptuous vests, Like infant Castor and his brother fair, Two boys; a girl like Helen, ere she threw Delicious poison from her fatal eyes, But tripp'd in blameless childhood o'er the meads Of sweet AmyclÃ¦, her maternal seat: Nor less with beauty was Sandauce grac'd Than Helen's mother, Leda, who enthrall'd Th' Olympian god. A starting look the priest Cast on the children; eager by the hand Themistocles he grasp'd, and thus aloud: Accept this omen! At th' auspicious sight Of these young captives, from the off'ring burst Unwonted light; Fate's volume is unroll'd, Where victory is written in their blood. To Bacchus, styl'd Devourer, on this isle, Amid surrounding gloom, a temple hoar By time remains; to Bacchus I devote These splendid victims; while his altar smokes, With added force thy prow shall pierce the foe, And conquest sit triumphant on thy mast. So spake religious lips; the people heard, Believing heard:âTo Bacchus, Bacchus give The splendid victims, hoarse acclaim resounds. Myronides, Xanthippus, Cimon good, Brave Ãschylus, each leader is unmann'd By horror, save the cool, sagacious son Of Neocles; the prophet he accosts: Wise, Euphrantides, are thy holy words! To that propitious god these children bear; Due time apply from each Barbarian stain To purify their limbs; attentive watch The signal rais'd for onset; then employ Thy pious knife to win the grace of heav'n. The chiefs amaz'd, the priest applauding look'd. A young, a beauteous mother at this doom Of her dear babes is present. Not her locks She tore, nor beat in agony her breast, Nor shriek'd in frenzy; frozen, mute, she stands, Like Niobe just changing into stone, Ere yet sad moisture had a passage found To flow, the emblem of maternal grief: At length the rigour of her tender limbs Dissolving, Artamanes bears away Her fainting burden, while th' inhuman seer To slaughter leads her infants. Ev'ry eye On them is turn'd. Themistocles, unmark'd By others, beck'ning draws Sicinus nigh, In secret thus commission'd: Chuse a band From my entrusted menials; swift o'ertake, Like an assistant join this holy man; Not dead, but living, shall these infant heads Avail the Grecians. When the direful grove, Impenetrably dark'ning, black with night, That antiquated seat of horrid rites, You reach, bid Euphrantides, in my name, This impious, fruitless homicide forbear; If he refuse, his savage zeal restrain By force.âThis said, his disencumber'd thoughts For instant fight prepare; with matchless art To rouse the tend'rest passions of the soul In aid of duty, from the altar's height, His voice persuasive, audible, and smooth, To battle thus his countrymen inflames: Ye pious sons of Athens, on that slope Behold your mothers! husbands, fathers, see Your wives and race! before such objects dear, Such precious lives defending, you must wield The pond'rous naval spear; ye gallant youths, Look on those lovely maids, your destin'd brides, Who of their pride have disarray'd the meads To bind your temples with triumphal wreaths; Can you do less than conquer in their sight, Or conquer'd perish? Women ne'er deserv'd So much from men; yet what their present claim? That by your prowess their maternal seat They may revisit; that Cecropia's gates May yield them entrance to their own abodes, There meritorious to reside in peace, Who cheerful, who magnanimous, those homes To hostile flames, their tender limbs resign'd To all the hardships of this crowded spot, For preservation of the Attic name, Laws, rites, and manners. Do your women ask Too much, along their native streets to move With grateful chaplets for Minerva's shrine, To view th' august acropolis again, And in procession celebrate your deeds? Ye men of Athens! shall those blooming buds Of innocence and beauty, who disclose Their snowy charms by chastity reserv'd For your embraces, shall those spotless maids Abide compulsion to Barbarian beds? Their Attic arts and talents be debas'd In Persian bondage? Shall Cephissian banks, CallirhoÃ«'s fountain, and Ilissus pure, Shall sweet Hymettus never hear again Their graceful step rebounding from the turf, With you companions in the choral dance, Enamour'd youths, who court their nuptial hands? A gen'ral pÃ¦an intercepts his voice; On ringing shields the spears in cadence beat; While notes more soft, but, issued from such lips, Far more inspiring, to the martial song Unnumber'd daughters of Cecropia join. Such interruption pleas'd the artful chief, Who said no more. Descending, swift he caught The favourable moment; he embark'd, All ardent follow'd; on his deck conven'd, Myronides, Xanthippus, Cimon bold, Aminias, Ãschylus, he thus exhorts: My brave associates, publish o'er the fleet, That I have won the Asian Greeks, whom force Not choice against us ranges, to retain Their weapons sheath'd, unting'd with kindred blood. Not less magnanimous, and more inflam'd, Mardonius too ascends the stately deck Of Ariabignes; there each leader, call'd To hear the royal mandate, he address'd: Behold your king, inclos'd by watchful scribes, Unfolding volumes like the rolls of fate! The brave, the fearful, character'd will stand By name, by lineage there; his searching eye Will note your actions, to dispense rewards Of wealth and rank, or punishment and shame Irrevocably doom. But see a spoil Beyond the pow'r of Xerxes to bestow, By your own prowess singly to be won, Those beauteous women; emblems they of Greece, Shew what a country you are come to share. Can victory be doubtful in this cause? Who can be slow when riches, honours, fame, His sov'reign's smile, and beauty, are the prize? Now lift the signal for immediate fight. He spake applauded; in his rapid skiff Was wafted back to Xerxes, who enthron'd High on Ãgaleos anxious sat to view A scene which nature never yet display'd, Nor fancy feign'd. The theatre was Greece, Mankind spectators; equal to that stage Themistocles, great actor! by the pow'r Of fiction present in his teeming soul, Blends confidence with courage, on the Greeks Imposing firm belief in heav'nly aid. I see, I see divine Eleusis shoot A spiry flame auspicious tow'rds the fleet, I see the bless'd ÃacidÃ¦; the ghosts Of Telamon and Peleus, Ajax there, There bright Achilles buoyant on the gale, Stretch from Ãgina their propitious hands. I see a woman! It is Pallas! Hark! She calls! How long, insensate men, your prows Will you keep back, and victory suspend? He gives the signal. With impetuous heat Of zeal and valour, urging sails and oars, Th' Athenians dash the waters, which disturb'd, Combine their murmur with unnumber'd shouts; The gallies rush along like gliding clouds, That utter hollow thunder as they sweep A distant ridge of hills. The crowded lines Of Xerxes' navy, in the streights confus'd, Through their own weight and multitude ill steer'd, Are pierc'd by diff'rent squadrons, which their chiefs, Each with his tribe, to dreadful onset led. Th' unerring skill of Pallas seem'd to form, Then guide their just arrangement. None surpass'd The effort bold of Ãschylus; two ships Of large construction, boast of naval Tyre, His well-directed beak, o'erlaid with brass, Transpierces; Attic Neptune whelms his floods O'er either found'ring bulk. Three more, by flight Wreck'd on Psyttalia, yield their victim crews To Aristides; vigilant and dire Against the ravager of Greece he stood, Like that Hesperian dragon, wakeful guard To Atlant?an fruit. Th' intrepid son Of Neocles, disdaining meaner spoil Than Asia's king-born admiral, with sails Outspread to fresh'ning breezes, swiftly steer'd By Ariabignes, crashing as he pass'd The triple tire of oars; then grappling, pour'd His fierce assailants on the splendid poop. To this attack the gallant prince oppos'd His royal person; three Athenians bleed Beneath him; but Themistocles he meets. Seed of Darius, Ariabignes falls In Xerxes' view, by that unrivall'd chief Whose arm, whose conduct, Destiny that day Obey'd, while fortune steady on her wheel Look'd smiling down. The regal flag descends, The democratic standard is uprear'd, Where that proud name of Eleutheria shines In characters of silver. Xerxes feels A thrilling horror, such as pierc'd the soul Of pale Belshazzar, last on Ninus' throne, When in the pleasures of his festive board He saw the hand portentous on the wall Of Babylon's high palace write his doom, With great Assyria's downfal. Caria's queen Not long continues in a distant post, Where blood-stain'd billows on her active oars Dash thick-adhering foam; tremendous sight To Adimantus, who before her flies With his dismay'd Corinthians! She suspends Pursuit; her sov'reign's banner to redeem Advances; furious in her passage sends Two ships to perish in the green abyss With all their numbers; this her sov'reign sees, Exclaiming loud, my women fight like men, The men like women. Fruitless yet her skill, Her courage vain; Themistocles was there; Cilicians, Cyprians shunn'd his tow'ring flag On Ariabignes' mast. The efforts joint Of gallant TrÅzen and Ãgina broke Th' Ãgyptian line, whose chief-commanding deck Presents a warrior to Cleander's eye, A warrior bright in gold, for valour more Conspicuous still than radiancy of arms. Cleander him assails; now front to front, Each on his grappled gunnel firm maintains A fight still dubious, when their pointed beaks Auxiliar Ãschylus and Cimon strike Deep in the hostile ship, whose found'ring weight, Swift from her grapples loosen'd by the shock, Th' affrighted master on Psyttalia drives A prey to Medon. Then th' Ãgyptians fly, PhÅnicians, fam'd on oriental waves, Resign the day. Myronides in chace, Xanthippus, Cimon, bold Aminias gor'd The shatter'd planks; the undefended decks Ran purple. Boist'rous hurricanes, which sweep In blasts unknown to European climes The western world remote, had nature call'd Their furies hither, so with wrecks and dead Had strewn the floods, disfigur'd thus the strands. Behold Cleander from achievements high Bears down with all TrÅzene's conq'ring line On Artemisia: yet she stops awhile, In pious care to save the floating corse Of Ariabignes; this perform'd, retreats; With her last effort whelming, as she steer'd, One Grecian more beneath devouring waves, Retreats illustrious. So in trails of light To night's embrace departs the golden sun, Still in remembrance shining; none believe His rays impair'd, none doubt his rise again In wonted splendour to emblaze the sky. Laconian Eurybiades engag'd Secure of conquest; his division held The eastern streights, where loose Pamphylians spread A timid canvass, Hellespontine Greeks, Ionians, Dorians, and Ãolians rear'd Unwilling standards. A PhÅnician crew, Cast on the strand, approach th' imperial throne, Accusing these of treachery. By chance A bold Ionian, active in the fight, To Xerxes true, that moment in his ken Bears down an Attic ship.âAloud the king: Scribes, write the name of that Ionic chief, His town, his lineage. Guards, surround these slaves, Who, fugitive themselves, traduce the brave; Cut off their heads: the order is perform'd. A favour'd lord, expressing in his look A sign of pity, to partake their doom The tyrant wild commands. Argestes' heart Admits a secret joy at Persia's foil; He trusts that, blind by fear, th' uncertain prince To him his wonted favour would restore, Would crush Mardonius, author of the war, Beneath his royal vengeance; or that chief, By adverse fate oppress'd, his sway resign. But as the winds or thunders never shook Deep-rooted Ãtna, nor the pregnant clouds Discharg'd a flood extinguishing his fires, Which inexhausted boil the surging mass Of fumy sulphur; so this grim event Shook not Mardonius, in whose bosom glow'd His courage still unquench'd, despising chance With all her band of evils. In himself Collected, on calamity he founds A new, heroic structure in his mind, A plan of glory forms to conquer Greece By his own prowess, or by death atone For his unprosp'rous counsels. Xerxes now, Amid the wrecks and slaughter in his sight, Distracted vents his disappointed pride: Have I not sever'd from the side of Thrace Mount Athos? bridg'd the Hellespont? Go, fill Yon sea; construct a causeway broad and firm; As o'er a plain my army shall advance To overwhelm th' Athenians in their isle. He rises; back to Athens he repairs. Sequester'd, languid, him Mardonius finds, Deliv'ring bold this soldierly address: Be not discourag'd, sov'reign of the world! Not oars, not sails and timber, can decide Thy enterprize sublime. In shifting strife, By winds and billows govern'd, may contend The sons of traffic; on the solid plain The gen'rous steed and soldier; they alone Thy glory must establish, where no swell Of fickle floods, nor breath of casual gales, Assist the skilful coward, and controul, By nature's wanton but resistless might, The brave man's arm. Unaided by her hand, Not one of these light mariners will face Thy regal presence at the Isthmian fence To that small part of yet unconquer'd Greece The land of Pelops. Seek the Spartans there; There let the slain Leonidas revive With all his warriors whom thy pow'r destroy'd; A second time their gen'rous blood shall dye The sword of Asia. Sons of those who tore Th' Assyrian, Lydian scepters from their kings, Thy Medes and Persians, whose triumphant arms From distant shores of Hellespont have tam'd Such martial nations, have thy trophies rais'd In Athens, bold aggressor; they shall plant Before thy sight, on fam'd Eurota's shore, Th' imperial standard, and repair the shame Of that uncertain flutt'ring naval flag, The sport of winds. The monarch's look betray'd That to expose his person was the least Of his resolves. Mardonius pierc'd his thoughts, And thus in manly policy pursued: If Susa, long forlorn, at length may claim The royal presence; if the gracious thought Of his return inspire my sov'reign's breast Throughout his empire to rekindle joy; Let no dishonour on thy Persians fall, Thy Medes; not they accomplices in flight With vile Ãgyptians, with Cilicians base, Pamphylians, Cyprians. Let not Greece deride A baffled effort in a gallant race Who under Cyrus triumph'd, whom to fame Darius led, and thou with recent wreaths, O conqueror of Athens! hast adorn'd. Since they are blameless, though thy will decree Thy own return, and wisely would secure Superfluous millions in their native homes, Before chill winter in his barren arms Constrain the genial earth; yet leave behind But thirty myriads of selected bands To my command, I pledge my head that Greece Shall soon be Persia's vassal. Xerxes pleas'd, Concealing yet that pleasure, artful thus: Deliberation to thy counsel due Shall be devoted; call the Carian queen. She then was landed; through Cecropia's streets A solemn bier she follow'd, where the corse Of Ariabignes lay. Mardonius met, And thus address'd her: Meritorious dame, Of all the myriads whom retreat hath sav'd, Hail! crown'd with honour! Xerxes thro' my voice Requires thy counsel to decide on mine. I add no more; thy wisdom, candour, faith I trust; without a murmur will submit To thy decision, but to thine alone. My care shall tend that clay, among the dead Perhaps the only glorious.âShe departs. He seeks the Magi, greeted in these words: Receive this body, all which now remains Of Ariabigues; let no dirge deplore Him as unhappy; Horomazes smiles On such a death; your lamentations vent On human nature, humbled and debas'd By cowards, traitors, who surviv'd this day, Ne'er to outlive their shame. Ye vet'ran bands Of Medes and Persians, who surround in tears These honour'd reliques; warriors who subdued The banks of Nile, where Hyperanthes fought, And late with me through Macedon and Thrace Swept like a whirlwind; change your grief to rage, To confidence that, unresisted still, You on the plain recov'ring what by sea Is lost, avenging this illustrious dead, From this enthrall'd metropolis of Greece Shall carry devastation, sword, and flames To LacedÃ¦mon, now your only foe. The native Medes and Persians at his words Are fir'd, in strength, in courage, not unlike Their brave commander, who in scorn beheld Th' inferior herds of nations. Now the sun Glows on the ocean. To his tent retires Mardonius; sternly in his wounded soul The late disgrace of Xerxes he revolves, Yet soothes his anguish by enliv'ning hope Of glory. Thus the tawny king of beasts Who o'er Numidian wastes hath lost a day In fruitless chace, of wonted food depriv'd, Growls in his den; but meditates a range, Enlarg'd and ceaseless, through unbounded woods, To glut his empty maw. Her charge perform'd, Before him sudden Artemisia stands. As Cynthia steps unveil'd from sable clouds On some benighted traveller, who beats A path untried, but persevering firm With undiminish'd vigour, well deserves Her succ'ring light,âthe queen in cheering smiles Accosts the hero: I have seen the king, Have heard thy counsel, have approv'd, confirm'd. Thy spirit, son of Gobryas, I applaud. Thou, not discourag'd by our foul defeat, From this unwieldy multitude the brave Wouldst separate, and boldly at their head Thy life adventure. Xerxes may assume A doubtful aspect. Counsel given by thee, By me approv'd, Argestes may oppose With all his malice. Only thou suppress The fiery sparks which animate thy blood; In patience wait; thy dictates will prevail, Our common vengeance too that traitor feel, Whom I saw lurking near the king's retreat. Farewel.âShe leaves him happy in her voice Of approbation, happier in her eye, Which spoke for his prosperity a wish; That eye, enlight'ning her majestic face With added lustre, from his grateful sense Of her transcendent talents thus applied To his behoof. His manly bosom feels, Beyond a veneration of her worth, Beyond a friendship to her friendship due, Desire of her society in war, Perhaps in peace. Participated thoughts With her, united counsels, he esteems A gain to both. His high-aspiring soul Enjoys the thought, nor entertains a shade Of jealousy or envy at her fame. He ruminates: Observing her advice, I shall succeed. Then startingâEarth and heaven! Where is Masistius? Oh ungen'rous heart! Which on the scent of its ambitious chace Forgot that best of counsellors and guides, Friend of my infant, youthful, manly age! If he be lost!âOh ominous the thought! Masistius lost!âMy fortune, hopes, and joys, My virtues are no more!âHe rushes wild Abroad; commands a gen'ral search; himself Down to the port precipitates his course. The son of Gobryas and the Carian queen Were thus remov'd. Argestes in that hour Obtain'd access to Xerxes. Cold with fear, By fortune tam'd, tormented still by pride, Th' uncertain king to him their counsel told; When thus Argestes, feigning wonder, spake: Dost thou appoint Mardonius king in Greece? O liberal prince! what servant in thy train Would not confront all danger to possess An empire, which the Hellespont alone Will bound? Already Macedonia's lord, Young Alexander, all the Thracian chiefs, Like humble vassals to Mardonius bend. Why should the king himself not conquer Greece, Now more than half reduc'd? Complete the work Appointed; choak the Salaminian floods; O'erwhelm th' Athenians in their isle, and reign Thyself supreme. The monarch starts, and wild In look, commands Argestes to pursue Th' impracticable toil with all the host; Then, stretch'd along, in vain solicits rest. End of the Sixth Book. BOOK the Seventh. Meantime while Venus from her Colian dome, Which o'er Phaleron cast a holy shade, Beheld the shatter'd fleet of Xerxes driv'n To refuge there precarious; from pursuit Recall'd, the Greeks, observant of their laws, Applied their pious labour to collect Their floating dead, and send with honours due Such glorious manes to the blest abodes. With artful assiduity remain'd Themistocles presiding, so to court Religion's favour. From the solemn toil, Accomplish'd now, to Salaminian strands He veers; the slain are landed; then his deck Himself forsakes. As Neptune, when the winds, His ministers of anger to o'erwhelm The pride of daring mortals, have fulfill'd His stern behests, and shook the vast profound, At length composing his afflicted reign, Serene from sated vengeance seeks the arms Of Amphitrite, watching his return With soft impatience in her placid grot Amidst encircling Nereids; so the chief To his Timothea in triumphant pace Advances. She that day had never left The beach; surrounded by Athenian fair, She rushes forward to his wish'd embrace. He stops; defil'd by slaughter, robs his heart Of such delights, and elegantly thus: O all-surpassing woman, do not dye That lovely bosom in Barbarian gore; The blood of Ariabignes, not my own, Encrusts thy husband's cuirass. She replies: Since not thy own, but hostile crimson stains Thy manly chest, Timothea will partake The honourable dye. O man divine! Thus for the public with a public kiss Thee I salute, thee saviour of all Greece, Thee scourge of Asia; thus will ev'ry wife Her husband; sisters, daughters thus infold Their brothers, sires; their tender hands like mine, Like mine their panting breasts, in transport bear These glorous marks of victory. Behold Those damsels pure, whose maidenly reserve Forbids such rapture; they in smiles, in tears Of gratitude and gladness, on the heads Of gallant youths triumphal garlands place. Laodice is nigh; she quits th' embrace Of her Aminias, and accosts the chief: Think'st thou, O son of Neocles, the dames Of Athens shrink to see Barbarian blood, Who would have spilt their own, had fortune frown'd; Had you, our slaughter'd husbands, left your wives No other choice than servitude or death? Fair dame, united to the bravest chief, In smiles he answers, fortune more benign Preserv'd those husbands for the happiest lot, Society with you. In holy brine Of Neptune's flood permit them now to lave, That love in bridal decency may greet Athenian wives. Ye men of Athens, vote That ev'ry youth and ev'ry maid betroth'd To-night be wedded. This the gen'ral voice Confirms a law. His winning words dispers'd Th' obedient fair; each warrior in the deep Immers'd his limbs, while PhÅbe's argent wheels Their track pursuing through unclouded skies, Diffuse around serenity and light. To his Timothea's mansion soon repair'd Themistocles; Sicinus there he found, Who earnest thus address'd him: Thrice I hail My lord victorious; from thy servant's lips Now hear a tale to melt the stoniest hearts Of all but Euphrantides, yet with joy Reward compassionâTo the sable grove, Where yew and cypress veil'd the hoary walls Of homicidal Bacchus, swift I led My choice companions; to the seer I told Thy pleasure; he indignant heard, and forc'd The victims forward to the fane abhorr'd. I follow'd careful, still in patient hope That he, though slow, would uncompell'd submit To thy commanding will; we enter'd all; Sandauce there at length her silence broke, Whom from her infants none so fell to part. O house of great Darius! where will end Thy woes? How many of thy sons are fall'n! Sad Ariana, sacrifice to love! Thou sleep'st; thy wretched sister lives to see Her children butcher'dâOn the pavement damp She threw her limbs, she clasp'd her lovely babes; They shudd'ring view Sandauce in distress; Too young to know their danger, they bewail Their mother, not themselves. The captive youth, Still sedulous and tender, from the spot, Where as in shackles of despair she lay, Essay'd in vain to raise her. Now the seer; Who in my look determination saw, Approach'd the loathsome idol, foul by age, In fell presumption utt'ring thus his wrath: These victims, Bacchus, did my voice devote To thy neglected altar; of thy spoil Themistocles defrauds thee; on his head Let fall thy vengeance, not on mine, stern god! This heard, the willing captives I remov'd From that grim seat of terror to these walls Of hospitality. Sicinus clos'd, When Aristides enter'd. Hail, he said, Well hast thou done, Themistocles! behold Me come attendant on illustrious dead, Whom on Psyttalia cast I bring to share The public funeral honours.âI salute Thee too, the son of Neocles returns; Our noble strife to serve the public best We both have well commenc'd. Prepare thee now To give thy counsel on my new device For better service still. Our climate holds All Asia now, her princes, wealth, and arms; I can detain her, till consuming time By famine, sword and pestilence, exhaust Her strength, and cover Greece with Persian graves. Too high thy ardour mounts, replies the sage; Forbear to think of strength'ning such a pow'r By desperation. To the feeble brute Necessity gives courage. Such a host Of men and steeds innum'rous on our fields, By nature's stimulating wants compell'd To fight for life, might blast our budding hopes. Ah! rather some new stratagem devise To send the Persians back; let famine, want, Let pestilence pursue their tedious flight, Depriv'd of succour from their vanquish'd fleet, Which do thou chace and bury in the waves. Farewell! my post demands me. Since their soil, I have observ'd the cnemies employ'd In wild attempts to fill the streight profound Between Psyttalia and th' Athenian shore. He gone, these thoughts Themistocles revolves: I will adopt his counsel, safe for Greece, Nor less for me; his banishment prolong'd Will discontent the people, and repeal'd Place him commander in th' Athenian camp To rival me. Discouraging the war By land, confining to the sea our strength, I shall secure pre-eminence. From thought To action turn'd, Sicinus he bespake: Before my presence all the captives bring. As Bacchus, not Devourer, in a smile Of heav'nly sweetness, proffer'd soft relief To Ariadne, when forlorn she sat, Her fate deploring on the Naxian rock; So gracious, so consoling were the looks Themistocles assum'd, in soothing phrase Accosting thus Sandauce: Thou shalt prove, So shall thy royal house, afflicted fair! A cordial friend in me. Sicinus, haste; Equip the bark which eastern colours dress, That, ere the moon forsake her lucid path, Thou mayst transport this princess to the king, Her infant train, and this ingenuous youth, With my best greetings. Say, the Athenian chief, Themistocles, these pledges of his truth And friendship sends; them rescued I restore, Him next will save. His Hellespontine bridge The Greeks vindictive menace to destroy, An enterprize of horror; this my pow'r, My dictates singly can and shall impede, Till he in safety hath regain'd his throne. Sandauce answers: O thou gen'rous Greek, To thee, to thine, may fortune ne'er be cold. But I, partaker of imperial pomp, In ease, in safety nurtur'd, who have deem'd My state above the sorrows which torment Inferior mortals, when my soul reflects On this new lesson by misfortune taught, Reflects how lately on a field of blood, Young as I am, I saw my husband fall, My children doom'd to sacrifice, myself To endless bondage, had not heav'n achiev'd This marvel of compassion in a foe, I, (O forgive me!) I suspect the lot Of all, ev'n thine. O prosp'rous, godlike man, May Horomazes from thy head avert Vicissitudes like mine! may envious fate Ne'er bring Sandauce's gratitude to proof! Thou never want the pity thou hast shewn! She ceas'd; she wept. When Artamanes spake: Her debt Sandauce can discharge alone By grateful tears; but I can promise more. In Persian thraldom lies a beauteous Greek, Nam'd Amarantha, Delphian Timon's child; For that bright maid's redemption I am pledg'd To her afflicted sire. Thy goodness shower'd On this excelling princess, shall augment My zeal the obligation to repay By Amarantha's freedom; till that hour Of retribution to thy virtues comes, We will proclaim them; nations shall admire Themistocles, and ev'ry heart abhor Inhuman Euphrantides. Now return'd Sicinus; him they follow'd. On her breast The lovely mother hush'd her female babe; But cold with horror at remembrance deep Of her unmatch'd calamities that day, She feebly falter'd o'er the iandy beach; While Artamanes led in either hand The tripping boys. Themistocles remain'd In these reflections, flowing from this proof Of fortune's changes: Few in Athens long Sustain their greatnessâbut to muse on ills Before they come, both time and thought I waste; Content at present that esteem procur'd, By this fair Persian, in her brother's court, May prove a gain. Timothea now approach'd; His hand affectionate she press'd and spake: How sudden thou my hospitable cares Of their endearing object hast depriv'd! In woe how graceful is that eastern dame! How young a mother! On a widow'd bed How early cast by fortune! Thou hast sent Sicinus with her; ever-watchful man, Some new contrivance thou dost bring to birth; Thou smil'st in silence; listen then to me. Since Aristides on this isle hath shewn That face rever'd, when banish'd, his recal The men of Athens, nay the women wish. This by Aminias to th' assembled tribes, Laodice informs me, will be mov'd; In this expect Myronides the brave, Xanthippus, Cimon, Ãschylus will join.â So will thy husband, interpos'd the chief; I will forestall them, not to others leave Such merit with our people.âShe rejoin'd: All will applaud thee. Now, my anxious lord, The second watch its measure hath consum'd; The moon descends, the sprightly birds are still; Dead sleep hath laid the soldier on his shield; The active sailor slumbers; all forget The hardships, rage, and tumult of the day; All but thyself reposing. Shall that mind Continue ranging o'er the field of thought, In pregnancy exhaustless, till the lark Salute the day-spring with his early song? Till thou unresting, unrefresh'd, resume The statesman's troubles, and the soldier's toils? Be counsell'd; oft the thunder-bearing god To Juno listens; thou my voice obey. He hears; serene conducts her to repose. As Jove on Ida, by Saturnia charm'd, Confess'd a rapture never felt before, While lucid dew of odours from a cloud Of gold distill'd around him; from the turf Beneath his feet while hyacinths upsprung, The unctuous lotos, and the crocus gay, To grace his secret tabernacle there Of love celestial; so the Attic chief To his Timothea, in her chamber pure, With bridal honours deck'd, perfum'd with flow'rs, Whate'er the meads of Salamis supplied, His tender flame in winning language breath'd: Whoe'er had whisper'd on our nuptial day That I should view thee, in a time remote From that sweet Ã¦ra, with superior joy, I should have held him ignorant of love. What is the cause, Timothea, that I feel My bosom pierc'd by transport yet unknown? That eastern fair, deliver'd from distress, Appearing then the fairest of her sex, Thou dost exceed. Timothea smiling spake: O thou artificer of sweetest wiles, Wouldst thou seduce me into vain belief, That I exceed Sandauce's youthful charms? But wouldst thou know, my husband (solemn here She modulates her accents), wouldst thou know Why thou survey'st me with uncommon joy? It is the conscience of a noble deed, Of gather'd trophies never match'd before, Creates this change. The perils of this day Were new to Athens, to thy race, and me; Thy sword hath rescued all, increas'd thy fame, Thy heart exalted; with increas'd delight, Thro' that bright medium of a happy mind, Thou look'st on ev'ry objectâsure on me Not less than others. Artless were these words, By nature prompted, nature's noblest fire. They ceas'd discourse. Her loftiness of mind, His valour, talents, policy, to love Subside. Perhaps the first of human pairs, Who in the bless'd Assyrian garden met, Were not more happy in their first embrace, Than fair Timothea and her conqu'ring lord! A pleasing stillness on the water sleeps; The land is hush'd; from either host proceeds No sound, no murmur. With his precious charge Embark'd, Sicinus gently steers along; The dip of oars in unison awake Without alarming silence; while the moon, From her descending, horizontal car, Shoots lambent silver on the humid blades Which cleave the curling flood. On carpets soft Sandauce's babes devoid of sorrow lie, In sweet oblivious innocence compos'd To smiling slumber. But the mother's breast Admits no consolation; when they skim Psyttalia's frith, at memory severe Of that disast'rous isle, she sudden sinks A lifeless image in the watchful arms Of Artamanes, who had studied well Her sorrows, knew each tender thought and care, Humanity his tutor. Swift he calls Sicinus: Friendly pilot, stay thy course; We must not leave Autarctus in his gore Behind, lest grief incurable reside In this fair breast, perhaps eternal shade In these extinguish'd eyes. Sicinus feels A sympathizing pain, of Persian stock Himself a branch, in Attic soil matur'd; He stops the bark and lands. The Asian tents Were still erect, whence Aristides comes In steel accoutred, to salute the dawn, Then breaking. Him Sicinus humbly greets, Requests, obtains the body, which convey'd On board he careful on the deck bespreads With canvass new. Impell'd by active strokes Of oars resum'd, the bounding vessel gains Phaleron's haven. Artemisia there, Whose vigilance, augmented by defeat, Had kenn'd the bark while distant, now arrests Her further progress; but no sooner hears The sad intelligence Sicinus gives, Than swift descending where Sandauce lay, That mourning fair in friendly strains accosts: O lift thy head, thou daughter of a king! Our sov'reign's sister, sister to the man My soul rever'd, to Hyperanthes good, The flow'r of Asia's princes! In thy woes I sharing cordial, cordially rejoice In thy redemption. Leave this doleful keel; Think of thy duty to approach the king; Thy other cares entrust to me.âShe said; They row to shore. To Xerxes, then retir'd, The queen conducts Sandauce and her train. The princess thus to him amaz'd began: A widow'd sister, late a wretched slave, With these three orphans just redeem'd from death, Sandauce greets her brother; but her tongue Would be disloyal to obtrude her tale, Her tedious tale of sorrows on his ear. The preservation of her king demands His first attention; that attention grant To him who comes deputed by a Greek, Thy friend, my guardian, saviour of those babes; Oh listen! thy salvation from his lips Receive. Fast bound by terror was the mouth Of Xerxes.âThen Sicinus: He who ranks Among the Greeks superior in command, In talents, prudence, policy, and arms, Themistocles, these pledges of his truth And friendship sends; them rescued he restores; Thee next will save. Thy Hellespontine bridge The Greeks vindictive menace to destroy; An enterprize of horror, which his pow'r, His dictates singly can and will impede, Till thou in safety hast regain'd thy throne. All from his presence straight the king commands, Save Artemisia; her in broken tones Addresses: Queen of Caria, singly wise Among my council, pity, not upbraid Thy master, suff'ring by his rash neglect Of thy sage voice unutterable pangs. He paus'd in torture. Prudent, she replied: Without a cause the lord of nations droops; Mardonius well hath counsel'd thy retreat, Who undertakes to finish, what his sword Hath well begun thro' Macedon and Thrace, This mighty war. Thy servant may succeed; In whose behalf? His master's: Thou wilt reap His fruits of glory; if Mardonius fail, He the disgrace. Thy march commence by dawn; Appoint the fleet's departure swift this night, To guard with force collected and repair'd The Hellespontine bridge; with grace accept The proffer'd service of th' Athenian chief; Load his returning messenger with gifts Of royal price, and, O my gracious lord! Fraternal kindness on Sandauce show'r. Her gallant lord hath perish'd in thy cause, Herself been menac'd by a barb'rous priest To see her children sacrific'd; a doom Themistocles withstood, and set them free. As when a timid child perceives a cloud Obscure the sky, and hears the thunder's peal, He weeps, he trembles, but the cloud dispers'd, The clamour ceasing, and the sun restor'd, His wonted sport resumes, forgetting fear; So chang'd the monarch. Artemisia, go, He said; the satraps instantly convene; Th' Athenian messenger, Argestes' son, Again before us with Sandauce call; Ne'er will I deviate from thy counsels more. First to Sicinus ent'ring he began: Say to thy sender, I accept well pleas'd His service pass'd and proffers; thou return; To him ten golden talents thou shalt bear. Thee from the depths of sorrow shall the king, Sandauce, raise; demand a present boon; Thou canst not ask what Xerxes will refuse. By gratitude surmounting grief inspir'd, Mov'd to retaliate kindness in the shape Herself had prov'd, the gen'rous suppliant thus: In Persian thraldom is a Grecian maid Of Delphian lineage, Amarantha nam'd; Her I demand of Xerxes, that my hand A captive daughter to a tender sire May render back; from bondage free his head, Now in NicÃ¦a, and thus far my debt Of gratitude discharge. In transport here, Admiring such perfection of the heart, Spake Artamanes: Ever live the king! There is a captive whom the princess nam'dâ Fly thou in search of this requested slave, Son of Argestes, interrupts the king; Let none withold her from Sandauce's pow'r. The female train before the cumb'rous host Shall move by dawn for Thessaly, there join The rest of Asia's dames behind us left On our late march; the guard, ten thousand horse, Thou, Artamanes, shalt command.âHe said; They all retir'd. A pensive grief o'ercasts Sandauce, moving with her children slow, By slaves attended, to the vacant tent Autarctus late possess'd. Argestes' son Observes her anguish, penetrates her thoughts, In guarded words then prossers this relief: O fairest princess, whose external form But half displays thy excellence of mind, Wilt thou forgive thy servant, if he feels With thee a present sorrow, which the heart Fobids the tongue to name? Sandauce, trust My pious service, and those thoughts compose. She, weeping, looks assent; he speeds away, But meets the body of Autarctus borne By Artemisia's soldiers. She at first, With care conceal'd, had order'd from the bark His precious reliques; these the noble youth With equal care delivers to that skill, Which with SabÃ¦an gums, and scented growths Of bless'd Arabia, purifies the clay Depriv'd of life, and Time's consuming breath Repels. A regal car he next provides, In full apparel of funereal pomp. End of the Seventh Book. BOOK the Eighth. The satraps now and leaders, at the call Of Artemisia, were collected round Their monarch. Seated on his throne, he spake: Ye princes, satraps, heed our fix'd decree. Our native Asia wants her king; by morn To Susa we return, but leave behind In Greece Mardonius, and a chosen host Of thirty myriads. With command supreme, With our imperial equipage and state, Him we invest; to him submission pay As to our presence. Artemisia, bear Our sov'reign pleasure to the naval chiefs, That all abandon, e'er the dawn return, Phaleron's port, and hoist their sails to guard The Hellespont. But thou, entrusted queen, Thy own tried squadron to Spercheos bring; Whence thou must wast to Ephesus a charge Of high import, the children of thy king. He ceas'd. A stranger, cas'd in steel, approach'd, In look ferocious, limbs and shape robust, Of stature huge; the satraps look'd amaz'd, As were th' immortals, when, th' Olympian steep Ascending, grim Briareus first produc'd His mountain-bulk, and spread his hundred hands, Auxiliary to Jove. The warrior stood, Unbending, far as nature would permit, His rugged brow; when, crouching to the king, O Xerxes, live for ever, he began: I am EubÅan Demonax, the prince Of Oreus late, who earth and water sent, Acknowledging thy empire; from my throne By curs'd Themistocles expell'd, I join'd Thy shelt'ring fleet; at Salamis I fought. An aid of troops and treasure can replace Me thy true vassal, who will soon reduce The granary of Athens to thy sway, EubÅa, sertile, populous, and rich. The monarch thus: Mardonius, thou hast heard; Begin to use thy plenitude of pow'r; Reject or favour at thy will this pray'r. Mardonius then: My sov'reign liege, the truth Flows from his lips; twelve thousand of thy host, With Mindarus commanding, and of gold A hundred talents, would be well bestow'd On this important Greek. The king assents; He rises; all disperse. Mardonius now Accosts the queen, descending to the port: Alas! how uncontrollable the will Of Xerxes! must thou leave me? Since the day Of Salamis, my best belov'd of friends, Masistius, whether by the waves devour'd, Or slain, or captive, to my search is lost. Foe to inaction, though compos'd and wise, Of courage prone to perilous attempts, He would embark; permitted by the king, Against my warm remonstrance would partake The naval conflict. Drooping, while I doubt His preservation, must I further lose Thy fellowship, auspicious, generous queen! Yet stop, a moment listen. On the march To Athens first, reposing in a cave, I had a dream, perhaps a vision saw, To me presaging gloryâbut success Was wrap'd in clouded mystery. My heart Teems with ill-boding thoughts, yet shall not faint; At least impart thy wishes ere thou sail'st, Thy last instructions! Fortunate thy voice, Benign to me; repeat one parting strain! If I successful to thy presence bring The palms of conquest, say, accomplish'd queen, Thou wilt accept them with a gracious hand; If unsuccessful I the forfeit pay Of this frail being, as becomes the brave, Say, thou wilt praise Mardonius. Sage and grave She answers: First, despair not to regain The good Masistius; at the worst endure, That common lot, the death of dearest friends, With patience; long thy courage I have prais'd, Now moderate the flame against a foe Not less discreet, than disciplin'd and bold; Nor let the gloom of superstition awe Thy noble ardour. On the sharpest sword, The strongest arm, on prudence, martial skill, Not dreams and visions, looks the goddess Fame. If Artemisia's wishes can avail, Be sure to prosper, prosp'ring here to soar Above the flight of Cyrus.âShe departs. Behind her, like the sinking globe of day, She leaves a trail of radiance on his soul; But, to protect him from returning shade, Her light should ne'er forsake him, never set. O'er gen'rous cares not thus Argestes broods; Within his tent he meditates conceal'd; By struggling pride tormented, thus he strives To sooth her pangs: I see my pow'r eclips'd; Mardonius governs. Pow'r, thou fleeting gleam, Thee I possess no longer; why regret, When Amarantha's beauty can exchange Thy thorns for lilies? To my own domain I will transport her; Sipylus hath flow'rs To drop perfumes in Amarantha's walk; Pactolus, Hermus, my subjected streams, Shall furnish gold; her gems shall India send To deck that form, and I in pleasure's folds Forget ambition, stranger to the peace Which honour yields. Libidinous in thought, The statesman thus would cheat his baffled pride; Accurs'd of men! who borrow'd from one vice His med'cine for another (both deform His ravag'd bosom in alternate strife) Flagitious parent! rivalling in love His eldest born! prepost'rous passion, big With horror! while the youngest, lov'd by all, By Xerxes favour'd, to Mardonius dear, He held in detestation for his worth, Nor knew the comfort of a virtuous child. With diff'rent thoughts that sleepless youth employ'd The night, serenely happy in the charge Humanity impos'd. Before the dawn His band is arm'd, Sandauce in her car, Among innumerable fair the chief In state and woe. Tears trickle at the sight Of great Autarctus in his fun'ral pomp Down ev'ry cheek; a solemn sadness reigns; So oft Aurora, sable-suited, leads A train of clouds, dissolving as they pass In silent show'rs. Through Attica's waste fields, Through half BÅotia, ere his ev'ning clos'd, The second sun conducts them to the gates Of antient Thebes. They enter; they ascend The citadel; they find commanding there, New from the ruins of unpeopled towns, Fierce Mithridates. With a kind embrace, To him the gentle Artamanes thus: Hail! brother: twice a captive since we last At Delphi parted, I would gladly know Thy fortune. Tell me, where that beauteous maid, Whom thou didst carry from the Delphian walls? The grim Barbarian spoiler, quick reply'd: Curs'd be her name, her beauty, which could melt A heart like mine! Accurs'd my father's lust, Which seiz'd my captive! Guarded by a troop Of jealous eunuchs, and attendants arm'd, Her in this citadel he still detains. If I resign her, may PlatÃ¦a's tow'rs, May Thespia's hostile walls by me o'erthrown, A second time to brave me rise from dust. Oh! unbecoming strife, the brother cry'd, Which startles nature! Thanks to Heav'n, the king Hath now decided Amarantha's fate; Her to his royal sister he hath giv'n, A promis'd boon. Sandauce, by the foe Restor'd to freedom, will requite that grace, By rend'ring up this damsel to her sire, Himself a pris'ner in NicÃ¦a's fort, Then both release from bondage. Further know, In Thebes to morrow Xerxes will appear On his retreat to Susa. I conduct This train of eastern dames. By rising dawn To her protection will the princess take The Delphian maiden, then proceed. These words Sting Mithridates; an atrocious deed He meditates, but artful thus conceals: Not to my father, to the king I yield. This said, they parted. Mithridates held The town; his brother's squadrons lay encamp'd Without the walls. The citadel contain'd A fane of Juno, there Sandauce rests. To Ådipus devoted was a dome, Which Artamanes enter'd, while his heart Ran cold and shudder'd at a brother fell, And treach'rous sire, competitors in love; Abominable strife! His eyes he cast O'er all the structure, lighted by the gleams Of tapers blue attending; he surveys, Insculptur'd round, the horrors which befel The house of Laius; there th' ill-fated son His father slays; incestuous there ascends His mother's chamber; daughters he begets, His sisters, sons his brothers; blameless he, A man of virtues by despair oppress'd, Rends forth his eyeballs, on the pavement dash'd. There sev'n dire captains, leagu'd by horrid oaths Which startled Heav'n, are figur'd; down to Hell Amphiar?us on his martial car, Through earth's dividing entrails, there descends; Here Capaneus, blaspheming Jove, expires Amid vindictive lightnings; mangled there, Eteocles and Polynices fall, Each other's victim to fraternal hate. Full of these hideous images the youth Reclines disturb'd, unvisited by sleep, Till awful midnight; broken slumber, adds To his disquiet. In a thrilling dream The eyeless ghost of Ådipus ascends; The vacant sockets, where the orbs of sight Once beam'd, are bleeding fresh; a Stygian pall Infolds the wither'd, pale, sepulchral form; The arms are stretch'd abroad: Forever Thebes Must thou to horror be the guilty stage! It said, and vanish'd. By the phantom wak'd, Or by a sudden clash of mingling swords, With skrieks and tumult, Artamanes rose, Unsheath'd his sabre, grip'd his target fast, And issued swift. Before his startled eyes A beauteous woman, of majestic form, In garb disorder'd, and with ringlets fall'n, Sustains aloft a poinard newly drawn From Mithridates' heart, who, sinking, breathes His last beneath her feet. So PhÅbe pierc'd Orion; so the groaning earth receiv'd His giant bulk, which insolently dar'd Attempt that child immaculate of Jove With violence of love. Now spake the fair: If to defend her chastity and fame Becomes a woman, self approv'd at least I stand, great Timon's daughter, from a line Heroic sprung, in holy Delphi born; If to have slain a ruffian be a crime Among the Persians, give me instant death, Such as becomes my dignity and sex. Her words, her looks, impress'd on ev'ry heart Amaze, and tam'd the savages combin'd With Mithridates in his impious act. So when, majestic on the choral scene, Her tragic pomp Melpomene displays, In awe profound she hushes rudest minds, While terror humbles tyrants. Gather'd round Were numbers now; a thousand torches blaz'd; Sandauce last, environ'd by her guard, Approach'd alarm'd. A wounded eunuch stepp'd Before the princess; I will cloath in truth My voice, he said. Argestes to my care Entrusted Amarantha; from that lord, Solicitations, threat'nings, gifts she spurn'd, While I admir'd: Sure virtue hath a ray To strike the meanest eye. To-night his son Assail'd our dwelling; with my fellow slaves, All butcher'd, I defended long my charge, By Mithridates from the mansion forc'd; Her chastity the noble maid hath sav'd, Her poniard stretch'd the ravisher in blood. To Artamanes, weeping o'er the corse, Sandauce then: To thy consoling words I oft have listen'd, listen thou to mine; Forgive the maid; illustrious is her deed For every maid to imitate. With me, Come Amarantha; thou art mine; not long Shalt so continue; at NicÃ¦a's fort I will restore thee to a joyful sire, And both to freedom. Morning breaks; the cars, The troops attend; the royal dame renews Her progress; seated at her footstool weeps, In speechless gratitude, the Delphian fair. By public duty Artamanes rous'd, Not long remains. This last fare well he sighs: Oh! early fall'n! Oh! cut from proudest hopes! Thee, Horomazes, may a brother's tears For him propitiate! he hath none to shed. These silent ruins to our father shew, Thou faithful eunuch. May he feel like me! His steed he mounts, and rapidly o'ertakes The squadrons, op'ning on Cadmean plains. Now Amarantha lifts her grateful head, Intent to speak; but, heavy on the front Of her protectress, heavier in her breast Sat grief, each sense devouring, and her frame Enfeebling; which, too delicately wrought, Endures not ev'n remembrance of distress So new, so strange in her exalted state, To youth untry'd by evils. She forgets Her late benignant act, till chance directs Her eye to Amarantha; when her heart, Sooth'd by the conscience of a gen'rous deed, Her faded cheeks relumines with a smile. Then spake the prudent virgin: Persian queen, (Sure such thou art) what marvellous event Gave thee a knowledge of my sire, his place Of residence, and my disastrous fate? Sense of thy goodness, from my breast would chace The memory of troubles, if alas! I did not see thy countenance o'ercast. If thou repent thee, of thy favour deem Me undeserving, send me to abide The punishment ordain'd by Persian laws; But if thy sorrows are thy own, unmix'd With my misfortunes, let assiduous zeal, Let tenderest service of my grateful hand Strive to relieve the burdens which oppress My benefactress. In the captive's hand Sandauce drops her own; in sighs replies: O! by thy aspect of superior mold To all I e'er beheld of regal race, Resembling me in fortune, lend an ear; My soul conceives a melancholy wish That thou shouldst hear my story, I to thine Alternate listen. Mournful converse soon Between these fairest in their native climes Began, continued; sev'n diurnal rounds The sun perform'd, till intercourse of grief, Communicated sighs, unite their minds In tender friendship. Diff'rent yet their lots; On Amarantha's cheek the bloom revives; A joyful sire, perhaps a dear betroth'd, Her fortune promis'd. In Sandauce's train A husband follow'd on his fun'ral bier; Her fleeting hue a sickly paleness taints, Which Artamanes with a sad'ning eye Observes, portent of malady. Now rose The eighth sad morn, revealing to their sight NicÃ¦a's neighb'ring gate. Sandauce then To Artamanes: Take this virtuous maid; To her my promise, to her father thine Fulfill; conduct her. Amarantha dear, From thee I part, rejoicing in thy joy; Amid thy comforts in a fire's embrace, Or bliss more tender with a destin'd spouse, Forget not me. Autarchus near the tomb Of Ariana by these widow'd hands DepositedâShe stops; the weaken'd pow'rs Of health relax, nor furnish sound to grief: Mute too is Delphi's maid. The Persian youth, To leave a moment in her sick'ning state The princess, feels a struggle, but resolves In rapid haste her mandate to obey. NicÃ¦a's gate he enters; Timon soon He finds: receive thy daughter, swift he spake; Receive thy freedom from the bounteous hand Of Xerxes' sister; but a short farewell My urgent cares allow; to set thee free At thy own time I hasten to enjoin The chief commander here. He said, and turn'd Precipitate away, unheard, unmark'd By Timon, who no other voice nor form Than Amarantha's heeds. In Carian steel Now MelibÅus from the gymnic school, Where he was daily exercis'd in arms, Approach'd; to him in transport Timon spake: Behold my daughter!âInstant from the port Appears Aronces, who proclaims the news Of Artemisia landed. She had left Phaleron; station'd in the Malian bay, She waits the king's arrival, not remote Now with his army; all advance to meet The Carian queen; when sudden clouds of dust The sky envelop; loud the hollow sound Of trampling hoofs is heard. The portal pass'd By Artamanes fac'd the southern sun; An entrance eastward rudely is possess'd By Caspian horsemen, in the hairy skins Of goats all horrid; round their brawny loins From shaggy belts keen cimeters depend; Well-furnish'd quivers rattle on their backs. Now fifty grim-fac'd savages dismount To seize on Amarantha. Then his arm New-train'd to battle MelibÅus proves; With native strength, agility and fire, He springs, confronts the Caspians; from the first He lops the ruffian hand; by diff'rent wounds Five more lie prostrate. As a vessel new, Compact and strong, impetuous from the dock In her first launch divides the troubled waves, On either side recoiling, till the weight Of reuniting waters stops her course, And beats her lofty ribs; so valour drives The warrior on, till rallying numbers join'd, Arrest his progress; fearless yet he stands A while defensive. Timon from the dead Lifts two forsaken cimeters; both hands His indignation arms; he sends to hell Three miscreants gasping at his daughter's feet. With aiding Theseus, so Pirithous heap'd With centaurs slain the LapithÃ¦an hall, When in flagitious tumult they deform'd The nuptial banquet, and his fair espous'd With violation menac'd. But the eye Of Amarantha mark'd th' unequal fight; Her poniard drawn, the only succour left, She holds intrepid, resolute on death, No second thraldom; when th' auspicious sight Of Caria's queen revives her fainting hopes. Stern Artemisia, rapid on the call Of vigilant Aronces, now approach'd In awful tone the Caspians: Sheath your blades, Ye fierce in look, not courage, or this arm (Her falchion here she waves) shall hide these streets With your vile carrion. Despicable herd Of rebels, led by what presumptuous fiend Dare you invade a fortress of your king, Ev'n in my presence, he perhaps in sight? They hear; they pause. Inclos'd by thick'ning guards, In multitude confiding, urg'd by lust, Which lends a courage new, Argestes fell, Inciting loud his ruffians to persist, Strikes her indignant eye. What wrath, what hopes Of just, of long-sought vengeance swell her breast! As when the mother of a lion brood, From wonted chace returning, sees a wolf, Or treach'rous tiger stealing towards her den, Who in her absence would securely prey On her defenceless whelps, her eyeballs roll In fire, she rushes on th' insidious foe With fangs resistless; he contends in vain, His chest she rends asunder, and his heart Devours unsated; so incens'd the queen, Begirt by Carians terrible in war, To each Barbarian terrible who saw Their high exploits on Salaminian waves, Rush'd on Argestes; MelibÅus brave March'd by her side a second, whom the god Of arms might rank among his foremost sons. The Caspians shrunk; by desperation bold, The satrap spurr'd his courser on the queen, And whirl'd a javelin shiv'ring on her shield; She on the forehead smote the restiff horse, Who, rearing, hurl'd his rider to the ground, Then points her dreadful weapon tow'rds the breast Of her detested foe, intent to pierce The trait'rous heart. This invocation first She solemn utters: Manes of the brave! Whom he devoted on the Malian fields Unpitied victims of his hate to me, To you, my subjects, this malignant head I immolate. Hence satrap, once the chief In pow'r and state, in vice and falsehood chief, Seek Rhadamanthus; tell him, while he frowns On his tribunal, Themis to my hand Her sword resign'd to cut thy treason short. Her vengeance levels now the mortal blow, When dignity restrains her. Rise, she said, Thou criminal, unworthy by this arm To die; preserve him, Carians, to abide The ignominous lot, by justice doom'd To common villains. MelibÅus, change Thy name; I clasp thee Haliartus now, My brother, prov'd by gallant deeds; at least No evidence but virtue I require For nobler union than congenial birth, By friendship's sacred ties to call thee mine. She scarce had finish'd, when a second troop Of horsemen through the southern portal spread New terror. In their front a splendid chief, Who wears a regal circle; round he casts A searching eye, impatient soon beholds Bright Amarantha, where she stands beset By Caspians, strangers to their leader's fate, Persisting still in pertinacious strife Against Aronces, and her manly sire; Then swift as sulph'rous ether, when its flame Divides a knotted oak or cleaves a tow'r, Flies on the ruffians: Do ye lift, he cries, Your hands profane against the destin'd queen Of Macedon? a carnage wide he spreads Beneath his trampling steed and pond'rous blade. Dismounting victor, he unclasps his helm, Her dear betroth'd to Amarantha shews In Alexander, Macedonia's king. Ne'er yet so comely, so endearing look'd A lover; rescu'd from Barbarian spoil She meets his arms, while Timon weeps in joy. With MelibÅus, from a stage of blood, The Carian queen approach'd, while thus the king His servent soul was opening: Oh! my love, My Amarantha! my affianc'd love! I feel, but cannot paint, my sorrows past, My present joys. The day, the appointed day To solemnize our nuptial rites was nigh, I left my kingdom, flew to Delphi's walls; Thou wast not there. What horror, when I heard Thou wast a captive! by what barb'rous hand None could inform me; thence from march to march I track'd the Persians; tidings of thy fate No tongue could tell; through Attica I rang'd, BÅotia, Phocis, Doris; Locris still Was left to search. Disconsolate I join'd The royal camp last ev'ning; there I heard Of Mithridates by thy virtue slain; At Thebes, of curs'd Argestes, who had held Thee pris'ner there; of thy departure thence With kind Sandauce to NicÃ¦a's fort; But further told, that base Argestes led The Caspian horse forerunners of the host, Alarm'd, my troop I gather'd, I pursu'd, Am come to save thee, nor one hour withhold The full protection of my nuptial hand. Th' illustrious virgin answer'd in a sigh: O Alexander, I am thine, thou mine By sacred vows; yet thou a foe to Greece! Then Artemisia: Noble maid, I praise That zeal for Greece, thy country; but forbear At this momentous crisis to combine Thy preservation with a public care; Thou need'st protection both of rank and pow'r. Few can resist the lustre of thy form, Which, left unguarded thro' the lawless course Of war, might light, in others less deprav'd Than foul Argestes and his barb'rous son, New flames to burst in violence again. She ceases; Timon ratifies her words. A mother's office now the queen performs In preparation for connubial rites; Nor old Aronces, nor th' acknowledg'd heir Of Lygdamis are slow. With human blood Impure, the streets are cleans'd, the slain remov'd; Flow'rs pluck'd for chaplets, nuptial torches burn, The altars smoke with odours, sternest hearts Grow mild, Bellona's furies sleep forgot, Her fifes and clarions soften to delight The ear of Hymen; joy concludes the day. End of the Eighth Book. BOOK the Ninth. Soft rose the morn, and still; the azure flood In gentle volumes, undisturb'd with tides, But heav'd by zephyrs, glaz'd the pebbled shore; When Caria's princess, visiting the beach With Haliartus, and her son belov'd, Her bosom thus disclos'd: O brother! friend In danger tried, not yet are Asia's woes Complete; to Greece new trophies I forbode. Oh! soon transported o'er these hostile waves, May Artemisia rest her wearied head At length in peace, and thou, so late redeem'd, With her partake the blessing! Ah! thy looks Reject the proffer-yet some rev'rence bear To Artemisia, some fraternal love. How shall I plead? will haughty Greece admit Thee to her honours, thee in humblest state, Tho' meriting the highest, known so long? Halicarnassus, an illustrious town, Among her noblest citizens will rank The son avow'd of Lygdamis. O cast A kindred eye on this my orphan boy! Who must become his guardian, who supply My care, should fate precipitate my doom? Tears down the beard of Haliartus flow'd, Afflicted, tho' determin'd. On his hand Leander hung; the captivating mien Of MelibÅus had at once allur'd The tender youth to entertain belief In old Aronces, when he first proclaim'd The swain true son of Lygdamis. These words From Haliartus broke: Thy birth, thy name, Thy virtues, queen, I rev'rence; of thy blood Acknowledg'd, more ennobled in thy praise, I feel my elevation; but thy ear Approving lend. Three suns are now elaps'd Since gen'rous Medon, by a faithful mouth, Convey'd his promise to redeem my head, Exchang'd for splendid captives, by his arm In fight acquir'd; I hourly watch to hail His peaceful mast, perhaps yon distant keel Contains his person. To forsake this friend, Whose kindness bless'd my former humble state, Friend of my childhood, youth, and ripen'd years, Would be an act, O thou of purest fame, To plunge thy brother in the lowest depth Of human baseness, baseness of the mind, Thy long-lost brother, found too soon a stain To Lygdamis and thee. Concluding here, He eyes the vessel bounding to the port, With branches green of olive on her head, Her poop, and mast; the Carian sailors hail The fair, pacific signal. On the beach The warrior leaps, when Haliartus cries, I see my patron! with expanded arms Flies to embrace him. Medon stops, and speaks: In splendid mail is MelibÅus cas'd? Are these not Persian standards flying round? Art thou enroll'd an enemy to Greece? No, interpos'd the queen, behold him free, To thee, to Greece unchang'd, in arms my gift; He is my brother, brother to the queen Of Caria. Medon here: Immortal pow'rs! Do I survey the wonder of her sex, That heroine of Asia, who alone, While now the fate of empire balanc'd hangs, Contributes virtue to the Persian scale? My friend to such a sister I resign. Ah! never, never, Haliartus cried, Shalt thou resign me; nor th' OÃ¯lean house Will I forsake; in that belov'd abode I was too happy for aspiring thoughts. First to redeem thy Locris I devote These arms; will perish there before thy foes, If such my fate, if victor in thy ranks, Hang in thy mansion my reposing shield, There make my home. Yet often will I court Thy welcome, princess, on the Carian shore To worship still thy virtue, on thy son Still pour the blessings of parental love. The Carian queen subjoins: I must approve, To such clear honour yield; bring Timon, call The king; Time presses, we must all depart; A sacred Delphian too from bondage freed Thou shalt receive, O Medon. Swift the chief To disembark his captives gave command; Five was their number; one beyond the rest In stature tower'd, his armour was unspoil'd, Though rich in burnish'd gold, emboss'd with gems Of starry light; his dignity and form The victors rev'renc'd. Medon to the queen: These Aristides, at my efforts pleas'd, Gave to my choice from numbers; an exchange For MelibÅus and the Delphian priest These I design'd; my friends thy bounty frees; Take these unransom'd from a grateful hand. O lib'ral man! the Carian princess here: Thou dost produce Masistius; virtuous lord! How will Mardonius in thy sight rejoice, How lift his hopes! To her Masistius bow'd, To Medon spake: O Grecian! if a thought To die thy debtor could debase my soul, I should deserve till death all human woes. Demand, obtain; to Asia I am dear, Lov'd by Mardonius, honour'd by the king, I cannot ask what either would refuse To him who gave me liberty and life. Thou canst, rejoins the chief, obtain a grace To me of precious worth, to Xerxes none; Nor golden stores nor gems attract my eye; I have a sister, dearer than the mines Of Ind, or wealth of Susa, who resides A priestess pure, on that OetÃ¦an ridge Which overlooks ThermopylÃ¦, her name Melissa; there an ancient fane is plac'd, No splendid seat oracular, enrich'd By proud donations, but a mossy pile, Where ev'ry Grecian hath from age to age Ador'd the muses. Lift thy hand to swear, Thou wilt implore of Xerxes a decree, Irrevocable like a Median law, Forbidding all to climb that holy crag. To him Masistius: Not the Delian isle, By Persians held inviolate of old, Shall boast of safety like Melissa's hill; For my performance, lo! I lift my hand To Horomazes. Thou, return'd, salute Athenian Aristides in my name; From me, his captive in that direful hour Of carnage round Psyttalia's bloody strand, Say, that my thankful tongue will never cease Extolling his beneficence and thine. To him far more than liberty and life I owe; in bondage precious were the hours, With him the hours of converse, who enlarg'd, Illum'd my heart and mind; his captive freed, I go a wiser, and a better man. Now with his consort Macedonia's king, And Timon were in sight; a sad'ning look Fair Amarantha mute on Timon fix'd, On her the father: We must part, he said; Alas! too many of thy father's days Captivity hath wasted, sorrow more Deploring thee, my child, while other Greeks, Erecting brilliant trophies, have obtain'd Eternal praise. Thee, Amarantha, found, Thee wedded, happy in thy choice and mine, I quit, my tarnish'd honours to retrieve. She then: In him a husband I avow Felicity unstain'd; in him ally To Persia's tyrant I am left unbless'd. Malignant fortune still pursues thy child; Before me holds a consort and a sire In adverse ranks contending. He rejoins: I know thee, daughter, like the manliest Greek The wrongs of Greece resenting, but thy heart Keep in subjection to a tender spouse Of constancy approv'd, whose house with mine, From eldest times, by mutual tokens pass'd In sacred hospitality is link'd. Thy pow'r of beauty never for thyself Employ, be all compliance; use that charm, As kind occasion whispers, in behalf Of Greece alone; by counsel sweetly breath'd, Diffuse remembrance of his Grecian blood Thro' Alexander's heart. While these converse Apart, the keels are launch'd; now all embark; Aboard his vessel Medon leads the son Of Lygdamis with Timon; on her own Imperial deck th' attentive queen dispos'd The Macedonian with his beauteous bride, And Persians freed by Medon, chief of these Masistius merits her peculiar care; Confin'd, Argestes trembles at his doom From Xerxes' ire. Along thy rocky verge, ThermopylÃ¦, with sails and shrouds relax'd, Smooth glide the Carian gallies thro' a calm, Which o'er the Malian surface sleeps unmov'd, Unless by measur'd strokes of sounding oars, Or foam-besilver'd prows. A royal guard, Preceding Xerxes, through that dreaded pass Were then advancing, not in order'd pomp, As on his march to Athens; now behind The regal chariot panic fear impell'd On its encumber'd wheels disorder'd throngs, As if Leonidas had ris'n and shook The snaky shield of Gorgon, or his sword, Stain'd with Psyttalian havoc, o'er their heads The living arm of Aristides wav'd. On sight of Oeta Carian's queen relates To her illustrious passengers the deeds Which signaliz'd that rock, nor leaves untold The fate of Teribazus, nor the wound Of Ariana, victims both to love. Now, where Spercheos from his spumy jaws A tribute large delivers to the bay, They land; Mardonius, passing tow'rds a tent Magnificent, erected for the king, Arriv'd but newly, on his way perceives Masistius; transport locks his tongue; he flies, Hangs on his friend, unutterable joy His tears alone discover. More compos'd, Though not less cordial, with a close embrace, First spake the late redeem'd: Receive thy friend, Whom wreck'd and captive on Psyttalia's isle, An Attic leader, Aristides nam'd, Restores unspoil'd, unransom'd, undisgrac'd! Mardonius quick: Thy unexpected sight, By an Athenian all unsought restor'd, Presages all the good my warmest hopes Could e'er suggest; the omen I enjoy; For this shall Athens, to my friendship won, Possess her laws, her freedom, with increase Of rich dominion. Artemisia then: Behold, the king of Macedon, his wife In Amarantha. Wond'ring at her form, Exclaims the Persian hero; of one crime I now acquit Argestes and his son; What ice of virtue could resist that face! Again the queen: For other crimes my ship Detains Argestes; him before the king To charge, immediate audience we demand. Mardonius guides them to the royal tent. With half his chiefs the monarch anxious sat, His swift departure by the break of dawn Arranging. Amarantha, in her shape A deity, among them sudden spreads A blaze of beauty, like the sun at noon In dazzling state amidst an ether blue Of torrid climates: admiration loud Wounds her offended ear. She thus began: What you admire, ye Persians, O that Heav'n Had ne'er conferr'd! the cause of woe to me, Of guilt in others; then a maiden hand Had ne'er been dipp'd in slaughter, nor these eyes Survey'd the pavement of NicÃ¦a strewn With subjects made rebellious by my fate, Thy subjects, monarch. With a Caspian troop Argestes forc'd thy castle me to seize, Th' affianc'd bride of Macedonia's king, Me, to Sandauce giv'n a royal boon, Me, then in freedom by the gracious will Of thy imperial sister. Help, unhop'd From Artemisia, from my husband came; Me they preserv'd, Argestes pris'ner bring To undergo thy justice. Caria's queen With Macedon's indignant prince confirm This accusation. On his own retreat Secure to Susa Xerxes all intent, Turns to Mardonius: thou be judge, he said; Take to thyself the forfeits of this crime. The king commands his servant shall be judge, Mardonius answer'd; chief among my foes Hath been Argestes, therefore must not die By my decree. Let Cyra, fort remote On Iaxartes hide his banish'd head; That care to Artemisia I commit; His satrapy, his treasure and domain To Artamanes his remaining son, Thy meritorious vassal, I ordain. This judgment pass'd, a murmur nigh the tent, Denouncing an ambassador, is heard; Ambassador of Sparta. Soon appears The manly frame of Aemnestus bold, Surpassing all his countrymen in arms, An Ephorus in office, function high; Whose jealous vigilance imprison'd kings Unjust, or impious, or assuming pow'r Unwarranted by laws. No train attends; He asks for Xerxes, when Mardonius stern: Before the future sov'reign of the world, With princes round him, single dost thou bring An embassy from Sparta? Spartans hold One man with one sufficient in discourse, Cry'd Aemnestus. Xerxes interpos'd: Reveal thy errand, stranger: He reply'd. Admonish'd by an oracle, the state Of LacedÃ¦mon, and the race divine There dwelling, sprung from Hercules, demand Of thee atonement for a slaughter'd king, Leonidas, whom multitude oppress'd, While he defended Greece; whate'er thou giv'st I will accept. The monarch to his cheek A shew of laughter calls; awhile is mute; Then, breaking silence, to Mardonius points. They shall receive th' atonement they deserve From him: Thou hear'st, Mardonius. Then, with looks Of scorn and menace: Yes, the Spartan said, Thee I accept my victim to appease Leonidas; disdainful then his foot He turns away, nor fears th' unnumber'd guard. Meantime the royal progeny is brought To Artemisia; urgent time requires, Their Father's fears the embarkation press For Ephesus that night. Them down the beach Mardonius follows, and the Carian queen In secret thus addresses: Didst thou mark That Spartan's threat'ning words and haughty mien? An oracle suggested this demand, Strange and mysterious. On the martial field Him I can single from Laconian ranks, Audacious challenger! but something more Behind the veil of destiny may lurk Unseen by me. Mardonius, she replied; Look only where no mystery can lurk, On ev'ry manly duty; nothing dark O'ershades the track of virtue; plain her path; But superstition chosen for a guide, Misleads the best and wisest. Think no more Of this, an object like that passing cloud Before the moon, who shortly will unfold Her wonted brightness. Prudent thy design To gain th' Athenians; to that noble race Be large in proffers, in performance true; Purchase but their neutrality, thy sword Will, in despight of oracles, reduce The rest of Greece. This utter'd, she embarks. He seeks his tent, and finds Masistius there, Whose honour, mindful of a promise pledg'd, Requests protection for Melissa's fane. Him in his arms the son of Gobrias clasp'd, Thus fervent answ'ring: Xerxes will renew His rapid march to-morrow; pow'r supreme He leaves with me, which instant shall be urg'd To render firm the promise of my friend. Now lend thy counsel on the copious roll Of Asia's host; assist me to select The thirty myriads giv'n to my command. They sat till dayspring; then the camp is mov'd; Then Amarantha, from her husband's tent Ascends a car, and traverses the vale, By fluent crystal of Spercheos lav'd, To join Sandauce. On her way she meets Artuchus, guardian of the Persian fair; The satrap gazes, courtesy entranc'd Forgets awhile her function. Thus, at length, He greets the queen: Fair stranger, who dost rise A second dayspring to th' astonish'd eye, Accept my service; whither tends thy course? Whom dost thou seek? and gracious tell thy name. In rosy blushes, like Aurora still, She graceful thus: Of Macedonia's king I am th' espous'd; my patroness I seek, Sandauce, issue of th' imperial house. Artuchus answer'd: Yesternoon beheld Her languid steps approach this vale of woe. Thou, beauteous princess, to Sandauce known, Thou must have heard of Ariana's fate; Sandauce now is mourning at her tomb, A grave preparing for Autarctus slain. Mayst thou suspend despair! Not distant flows The fount of sorrow, so we styl'd the place, Frequented oft by Ariana's grief; There oft her head disconsolate she hung To feed incessant anguish, ne'er disclos'd Unless in sighing whispers to the stream; Her last abode is there. The myrtles shed Their odours round, the virgin roses bloom; I there have caus'd a monument to rise, That passing strangers may her name revere, And weep her fortune; from her early grave May learn, how Heav'n is jealous of its boons, Not long to flourish, where they most excel. A marble mansion new erected nigh Her faithful slaves inhabit; who attune To thrilling lutes a daily fun'ral song. He leads, he stops. On gently-moving air Sweet measures glide; this melancholy dirge, To melting chords, by sorrow touch'd, is heard. Cropp'd is the rose of beauty in her bud, Bright virtue's purest mansion is defac'd; Like Mithra's beams her silken tresses shone In lustre gentle as a vernal morn; Her eye reveal'd the beauties of her mind; The slave, the captive, in her light rejoic'd. Lament, ye daughters of Choaspes, wail, Ye Cissian maids, your paragon is lost! Once like the fresh-blown lily in the vale, In Susa fair, in radiancy of bloom Like summer glowing, till consuming love Deform'd her graces; then her hue she chang'd To lilies pining in decay, but kept The smile of kindness on her wasted cheek. Lament, ye daughters of Choaspes, wail, Ye Cissian maids, your paragon is lost! O ray of wisdom, eye of virtue, form'd To spread superior light, the dazzling brand Of love malign obscur'd thy eagle sight; Thy vital flames are vanish'd, ours remain, As lamps to endless mourning in thy tomb, Till we rejoin thee in a land of bliss. Lament, ye daughters of Choaspes, wail, Ye Cissian maids, your paragon is lost! The song concludes. Sandauce from a bank Of turf uprises, resting on her slaves; A pallid visage, and a fainting step, She brings before the sepulchre and spake: O Ariana! listen from thy tomb, To me in woe thy sister, as in blood! By diff'rent fortunes both were doom'd to waste An early bloom in sorrow; O admit Autarctus first a neighbour to thy clay, Me next, who feel my vital thread unwind. O Heav'n! my humble spirit would submit To thy afflicting handâbut ev'ry fount Of health is dry'd; my frame enfeebled sinks Beneath its trial. When the inhuman priest Condemn'd my children to his cruel knife, The freezing sheers of fate that moment cut My heart-strings; never have they heal'd again; Decay'd and wither'd in the flower of life, My strength deserts my patience: tender friends Provide another grave.âFor whom? bursts forth Emathia's queen, and threw her clasping arms Around the princess; whose discolour'd hue In warm affection flushes at the sight Of Amarantha, as a languid rose, Shrunk by the rigour of nocturnal frosts, A while reviving at the tepid rays Of wintry PhÅbus, glows. For me, she sigh'd, For me, that bed of endless rest is made. Com'st thou, neglectful of thy nuptial bliss, To poor Sandauce's burial! soon the hour, When of the sun these sickly eyes must take Their last farewel, may call thy friendly hand To close their curtains in eternal night! These words the Grecian fair, in sorrow try'd, In constancy unshaken, swift return'd: Thou shalt not die, avoid this mournful spot, Thou hast accomplish'd all thy duty here; Let other duties, wak'ning in thy breast, Strive with despair; transported in my arms, To Alexander's capital resort. Thou shalt not die; returning health, allur'd By Amarantha's love and tender care, Again shall bless her patroness, renew Her youth in bloom, in vigour, ne'er to leave Her infants doubly orphans. At their name The princess faints, too sensitive a plant, Which on the lightest touch contracts the leaves, And seems to wither in the fold of death. Her lovely weight Artuchus to his tent Conveys; a litter gentle, as it moves, Receives her soon; her children by her side, In Macedonian chariots are dispos'd, Her female slaves and eunuchs. Now appears Emathia's prince to guard his matchless bride; In arms complete, resembling Mars, he rules The fiery courser. Artamanes swift This royal mandate to Artuchus bears: The king, O satrap, hath begun his march; Delay not thine with all thy precious charge. To Artamanes then, the Grecian queen: Let me request thee in Sandauce's name To visit yonder fount, of sorrow call'd, There see th' unfinish'd obsequies perform'd, To great Autarctus due. Her languid head With me a while at ÃgÃ¦ will repose, My consort's royal seat; and, gentle youth, If justice whisper to thy feeling heart, That well I sav'd my innocence and fame, Thou wilt be welcome to the ÃgÃ¦an hall. This said, she mounts her chariot; not unpleas'd, He to accomplish her command proceeds. Artuchus now conducts the female train, Unhappy victims of ambition! These, A prey to famine, to congealing blasts From cold Olympus, from Bisaltic hills, And Rhodope, snow-vested, were condemn'd, With that innumerable host in flight Unform'd, unfurnish'd, scatter'd, to partake Of miseries surpassing nature's help. On earth's unwholsome lap their tender limbs To couch, to feed on grass, on bitter leaves, On noisome bark of trees, and swell the scene Between Spercheos and the distant shores Of Hellespontine Sestos: real scene Of death, beyond the massacre denounc'd By that stern angel in the prophet's dream, When were assembled ev'ry fowl of prey From all the regions of the peopled air, At Heav'ns dread call, to banquet on the flesh Of princes, captains, and of mighty men. End of the Eighth Book. BOOK the Tenth. Now is the season, when Vertumnus leads Pomona's glowing charms through ripen'd groves Of ruddy fruitage; now the loaden vine Invites the gath'ring hand, which treasures joy For hoary winter in his turn to smile. An eastern course before autumnal gales To Ephesus the Carian gallies bend; While Medon coasts by Locris, and deplores Her state of thraldom. Thrice Aurora shews Her placid face; devourer of mankind, The sea, curls lightly in fallacious calms; To Medon then the wary master thus: My chief, the dang'rous equinox is near Whose stormy breath each prudent sailor shuns, Secure in harbour; turbulent these streights Between EubÅa and the Locrian shore; Fate lurks in eddies, threatens from the rocks; The continent is hostile; we must stretch Across the passage to EubÅa's isle, There wait in safety till the season rude Its wonted violence hath spent. The chief Replies: An island, AtalantÃ© nam'd, Possess'd by Locrians, rises in thy view; There first thy shelter seek; perhaps the foe Hath left that fragment of my native state Yet undestroy'd. Th' obedient rudder guides, The oars impel the well directed keel Safe through an inlet op'ning to a cove Fenc'd round by rising land. At once the sight, Caught by a lucid aperture of rock, Strays up the island; whence a living stream, Profuse and swift beneath a native arch, Repels encumb'ring sands. A slender skiff, Launch'd from the ship, pervades the sounding vault; With his companions Medon bounds ashore, Addressing Timon: Delphian guest, these steps, Rude hewn, attain the summit of this rock; Thence o'er the island may our wary ken, By some sure sign, discover if we tread A friendly soil, or hostile. They ascend. The topmost peak was chisell'd to display Marine PalÃ¦mon, colossean form, In art not specious. Melicertes once, Him Ino, flying from th' infuriate sword Of Athamas her husband, down a cliff, Distracted mother, with herself immers'd In ocean's salt-abyss. Their mortal state Neptunian pity to immortal chang'd; From Ino she became Leucothea, chief Among the nymphs of Tethys; he that god Benign, presiding o'er the tranquil port, PalÃ¦mon, yielding refuge to the toils Of mariners sea-worn. One mighty palm Lean'd on a rudder, high the other held A globe of light, far shooting through the dark, In rays auspicious to nocturnal keels Which plough the vex'd Euripus. Fair below, Her cap of verdure AtalantÃ© spreads, Small as a region, as a pasture large, In gentle hollows vary'd, gentle swells, All intersected by unnumber'd tufts Of trees fruit-laden. Bord'ring on the streights, Rich Locris, wide BÅotia, lift their woods, Their hills by Ceres lov'd, and cities fam'd; Here Opus, there Tanagra; Delium shews Her proud PhÅbean edifice, her port Capacious Aulis, whence a thousand barks With Agamemnon sail'd; a lengthen'd range EubÅa's rival opulence oppos'd, Queen of that frith; superb the structures rise Of Oreus, Chalcis, and the ruins vast Of sad Eretria, by Darius crush'd. The Locrian chief salutes the figur'd god: Still dost thou stand, PalÃ¦mon, to proclaim OÃ¯lean hospitality of old, Which carv'd thee here conspicuous, to befriend The sailor night-perplex'd? Thou only sign Left of OÃ¯lean greatness! wrapp'd in woe Is that distinguish'd house! Barbarians fill Her inmost chambers! O propitious god! If yet some remnant of the Locrian state Thou dost protect on AtalantÃ©'s shore, Before I leave her shall thy image smoke With fattest victims! Timon quick subjoins: I see no hostile traces; numerous hinds Along the meadows tend their flocks and herds; Let us, descending, and the crested helm, The spear, and shield, committing to our train, In peaceful guise salute a peaceful land. They hear, approving; lightly back they speed; Disarm'd, they follow an inviting path, Which cuts a shelving green. In sportive laugh, Before the threshold of a dwelling nigh, Appear young children; quickning then his pace, O Haliartus, Medon cries, I see My brother's offspring! They their uncle knew, Around him flock'd, announcing his approach In screams of joy: Their sire, Leonteus, came. As Leda's mortal son in Pluto's vale Receiv'd his brother Pollux, who, from Jove Deriv'd, immortal, left the realms of day, And half his own divinity resign'd, His dear-lov'd Castor to redeem from death; So rush'd Leonteus into Medon's arms, Thus utt'ring loud his transport: Dost thou come To me and these a saviour! When that cloud Of dire invasion overcast our land, For sev'n defenceless insants what remain'd? What for a tender mother? Instant flight Preserv'd us; still we unmolested breathe In AtalantÃ©; others like ourselves Resorted hither; barren winter soon Will blast the scanty produce of this isle, Pale famine waste our numbers; or, by want Compell'd, this precious remnant of thy friends, These rising pillars of th' OÃ¯lean house Must yield to Xerxesâbut the gods have sent In thee a guardian. Summon all our friends, Elated Medon answers; ev'ry want Shall be supply'd, their valour in return Is all I claim. Meantime, like watchful bees To guard th' invaded hive, from ev'ry part The Islanders assemble; but the name Of Medon, once divulg'd, suppresses fear, And wond'ring gladness to his presence brings Their numbers. He, rememb'ring such a scene Late in Calauria, where afflicted throngs Around his righteous friend of Athens press'd; Now in that tender circumstance himself Among his Locrians, conscious too of means To mitigate their suff'rings, melts in tears Of joy. O countrymen belov'd! he cries, I now applaud my forecast, which secur'd The whole OÃ¯lean treasures; safe they lie At LacedÃ¦mon, whence expect relief In full abundance on your wants to flow. Amid his country's ruins Medon still May bless the gods; by your auspicious aid, Beyond my hopes discover'd, I may bring No feeble standard to the Grecian camp, When Athens, now triumphant o'er the waves, With her deep phalanx in the field completes The overthrow of Asia, and restores Dejected Locris. So to Israel's sons, Their little ones and wives, by deathful thirst Amid the parching wilderness oppress'd, Their legislator, with his lifted rod, Consoling spake, who, Heav'n intrusted, knew One stroke would open watry veins of rock, And preservation from a flinty bed Draw copious down. Leonteus lead the way, Resum'd his brother: vers'd in arms, my youth, My prime, are strangers to the nuptial tie; Yet, in thy bliss delighting, I would greet A sister, auth'ress of this blooming troop. With all the clust'ring children at his side He pass'd the threshold, and their mother hail'd. Now o'er their heads the equinoctial gusts Begin to chace the clouds; by tempests torn, The hoarse Euripus sends a distant sound. Twelve days are spent in sweet domestic joy; Serenity returns. The master warns; Departing Medon reascends the bark, Whose rudder stems the celebrated frith, Where twice sev'n times the sun and stars behold Reciprocating floods. Three days are pass'd When Sunium, Attic promontory, shades The resting sail; Belbina thence they seek By morn's new glance, and reach at dewy eve. Athenian too Belbina yields a port To night-o'ertaken sailors in their course Between Cecropia and TrÅzene's walls. A squadron there is moor'd; Cleander there, Now ev'ry public duty well discharg'd Dismiss'd him glorious to his native roof, Was disembark'd. Contemplating in thought His Ariphilia, for the day's return He languish'd; ev'ry Nereid he invok'd To speed his keel. Him Medon, landing, greets; To whom Cleander: On Calauria first We interchang'd embraces; now accept A salutation doubly warm, O chief! By Aristides pris'd, his second bold In high exploits, which signalize an isle Obscure before, Psyttalia; be my guest This night at least: He said; they pass'd aboard With Haliartus and the Delphian seer. A gen'rous meal concluded, Medon spake: TrÅzenian chief, now give the mind repast; I have been absent long; when first the flight Of Asia's host and shatter'd fleet was known, From Salamis I hoisted sail. To hear Of Aristides and the laurell'd son Of Neocles, to hear of all the brave, Whose high achievements consecrate that day, From thy narration would delight my soul. Cleander then began: To council call'd By Eurybiades, the leading Greeks A while debated, if their fleet combin'd Should sail to break the Hellespontine bridge? This he oppos'd; I readily had join'd Th' Athenian people, eager by themselves Without auxiliar Grecians, to pursue The arrogant invader; but the tribes, In form assembled, with dissuasive words, Themistocles thus cool'd. I oft have seen, Have oftner heard, that vanquish'd men, constrain'd By desperation, have their loss repair'd In fight renew'd. Repelling such a cloud Of enemies from Greece, contented rest; The pow'r of gods and heroes, not our own, Achiev'd the deed; pursue not those who fly. Resort to Athens; in their old abodes Replace your women, such obsequious wives, Such daughters; reinstate your native walls, Rebuild your ruin'd mansions; sow your fields, Prevent a dearth; by early spring unfurl Your active sails, then shake the eastern shores. He last propos'd, that exiles be recall'd. Loud acclamations rose; the honour'd name Of Aristides thunder'd on the beach. O wise Athenians! Medon cordial here: O happy man, whose happiness is plac'd In virtuous actions! happiest now a scope Is giv'n unbounded to thy hand and heart! Proceed Cleander. He his tale renews: Th' Athenians launch their gallies, all embark With Aristides, chosen to that charge. I set my ready canvass to perform The last kind office, from Calauria's isle And TrÅzen's walls to wast their wives and race, Left in our trust. Meantime the diff'rent chiefs Meet on the isthmus, summon'd to decide Who best had serv'd the public, who might claim The highest honours. Every leader names Himseif the first, but all concurrent own Themistocles the second. Envy still Prevails; without decision they disperse, Each to his home. Themistocles incens'd, In eager quest of honours justly due, Withheld unjustly, not to Athens bends His hast'ning step, but Sparta...Medon here: Not so would Aristidesâbut forgive My interrupting voice. The youth pursues: In Athens him I join'd, a people found, Whom fortune never by her frown depress'd, Nor satisfied with favour. Active all, Laborious, cheerful, they persist in toil, To heave the hills of ruin from their streets, Without repining at their present loss, Intent on future greatness, to be rais'd On persevering fortitude: The word Of Aristides guides. Amidst a scene Of desolation, decency provides The fun'ral pomp for those illustrious slain At Salamis; th' insculptur'd tomb I saw Preparing; they already have ordain'd A distant day to solemnize the rites; The mouth of Aristides they decree To celebrate the valiant, who have died For Athens. While Themistocles accepts A foreign praise in Sparta, olive crowns, A car selected from the public store, A guard, three hundred citizens high-rank'd, Him through their tracts are chosen to attend, Excess of rev'rence, by that rigid state Ne'er shewn before. To small TrÅzene's walls To-morrow I return with less renown, With less desert, perhaps to purer bliss. My Ariphilia calls her soldier home To give her nuptial hand. My welcome guest You I invite; the season rude of Mars Is clos'd; new combats will the spring supply; Th' autumnal remnant, winter hov'ring near, Let us possess in peace. Then Timon spake: Young chief, I praise thee; be a husband soon, Be soon a parent; thou wilt bear thy shield With constancy redoubled. If defence Of our forefathers, sleeping in their tombs, So oft unsheaths our swords, more strongly sure Th' endearing, living objects of our love Must animate the gen'rous, good, and brave. I am unworthy of that praise, in smiles Subjoins the Locrian; but thou know'st, my friend, I have a brother, of a copious stream The source, he, call'd to battle, shall maintain OÃ¯lean fame. Cleander, I am bound To LacedÃ¦mon; treasure there I left, Which, well exchang'd for nature'd foodful gifts, I would transport to AtalantÃ©'s shore, Seat of that brother; who, Leonteus nam'd, With brave companions there in refugh lies, A future aid to Greece. A list'ning ear Cleander yields, while Medon's lips unwind The varied series of events befall'n Himself and Timon, Amarantha fair, The Carian queen, and MelibÅus chang'd To Haliartus. By th' immortal gods We will not sep'rate, fervent cries the youth; My Ariphilia, who is wise and good, Will entertain society like yours, As Ãthiopia, in MÃ¦onian song, Receives to pure and hospitable roofs Her visitants from heav'n. Let youth advise, Not inexperienc'd, but o'er land and sea To early action train'd; retaining all Your narrative heart-piercing, I perceive Your wants, and feel impatience to befriend; My lightest keel to Salamis shall bear Thy orders, Timon, for the Delphian barks, There left behind you, in TrÅzene's port To join you straight. His counsel they accept. The moon is rising, Salamis not far; The will of Timon to his Delphian train Is swiftly borne. The squadron next proceeds, Passing TrÅzene by, whose gen'rous chief Accompanies to shore his Locrian guest At Cynosura. Spartan is this port, He said; with fifty followers speed thy way; Commit no treasure to the faithless winds; By land return to find thy ready barks, Well-fill'dfrom TrÅzen's stores. They part; he sails To joyful welcome on his native shores. When now, unveiling slowly, as she rolls, Her brother's light the moon reflected full, Auspicious period for connubial rites, From LacedÃ¦mon hast'ning, Medon gains TrÅzene's ramparts; him Cleander chose His paranymph to lead the bridal steps Of Ariphilia. To Calauria's verge He pass'd; beneath a nuptial chaplet gay He wore his crisped hair; of purest white A tunic wrapp'd his sinewy chest and loins, A glowing mantle, new in Tyrian dye, Fell down his shoulders. Up the shelving lawn The high Neptunian structure he attains, Where with her parents Ariphilia waits Attir'd in roses like her hue, herself As Flora fair, or Venus at her birth, When from the ocean with unrifl'd charms The virgin goddess sprung. Yet, far unlike A maid sequester'd from the public eye, She, early train'd in dignity and state, In sanctity of manners to attract A nation's rev'rence, to th' advancing chief In sweet composure unreluctant yields Her bridal hand, who down the vaulted isle, Where echo joins the hymeneal song, Conducts the fair; before the costly shrine, Perfum'd with incense, and with garlands deck'd, Presents her charms, and thus in manly pray'r: My patron god, from Salamis I come, One of thy naval sons, erecting there Thy recent trophies; let me hence convey With thy concurrent smile this precious prize, Thy sacerdotal virgin. I return To thee a pious votary, to her A constant lover; on thy servants pour Thy nuptial blessing. Yet, earth-shaking god, Not bound in sloth thy warrior shall repose, Nor languishing obscure in sweetest bliss Desert thy glory. Soon as wintry storms Thy nod controls, and vernal breezes court The unfurling canvass, my unweary'd helm Shall cleave thy floods, till each Barbarian coast Acknowledge thy supremacy, and bow To Grecian Neptune. Credulous the train, Surrounding, in religious rapture see The colossean image of their god Smile on their hero, meriting the smiles Of deities and mortals. Fortune adds Her casual favour; on Cleander's mast To perch, a pair of turtle doves she sends From Neptune's temple. To his vessel crown'd With Hymen's wreaths, bestrewn with herbs and flow'rs, Exhaling fragrance, down the slope he guides His Ariphilia, priestess now no more. So Hermes, guardian of the Graces, leads Their chief, Aglaia, o'er th' Olympian hall, Warn'd by the muses, in preluding strains, The dance on heav'n's bright pavement to begin, And charm the festive gods. The flood repass'd, They, as TrÅzenian institutes require, The fane of young Hippolytus approach, That victim pure to chastity, who left Old Theseus childless. From the youthful heads Of both their hair is sever'd, on his shrine Their maiden off'ring laid, They next ascend An awful structure, facred to the Fates, There grateful own that goodness which decreed Their happy union. To the Graces last Their vows are paid, divinities benign, Whom Ariphilia fervent thus invokes: O goddesses, who all its sweetness shed On human life! whate'er is beauteous here, Illustrious, happy, to your favour owes Its whole endearment; wanting you, our deeds Are cold and joyless. In my husband's eye Preserve me lovely, not in form alone, But that supreme of graces in my sex, Complacency of love. She pray'd; her look Reveal'd, that heav'n would ratify her pray'r. Now in her father's dwelling they remain Till dusky ev'ning. On a bridal car, Constructed rich, the paranymph then seats The blooming fair; one side Cleander fills, The other Medon, she between them rides, By torches clear preceded. Lively sounds The ceremonial music; soon they reach The bridegroom's mansion; there a feast receives Unnumber'd friends; the nuptial dance and song Are now concluded. To her fragrant couch A joyful mother lights the blushing bride; Cleander follows; in the chamber shut, He leaves the guests exulting to revive Their song to Hymen, and renew the dance. Three days succeeding were to gymnic feats Devoted; Medon's warlike spear obtains A second chaplet; Haliartus won The wrestler's prize; to hurl the massy disk None match'd the skill of Timon, still robust, Tho' rev'rend threads of silver had begun To streak his locks of sable. Southern gales Now call on Medon's laden fleet to sail, Ere winter frowns. With Timon at his side, And Haliartus, in this gentle phrase His noble host and hostess fair he greets: May ev'ry joy kind wishes can devise, Or language utter, hospitable pair, Be yours for ever! may a num'rous race In virtue grow by your parental care!â With sev'n dear pledges of connubial love I left a brother, watching my return In AtalantÃ©, small, exhausted isle, Which needs my instant succour. Gen'rous friend, To thee I trust my treasure, thou discharge The claim of TrÅzen for th' abundant stores Which load our vessels; for a time farewell, The vernal sun will see our love renew'd, And swords combin'd against Mardonius bold. He said: the lovely Ariphilia weeps; Cleander sighs, but speeds his parting guests. End of the Tenth Book. VOL. II. BOOK the Eleventh. Th' unloosen'd anchors to the waves resign The Delphian keels, while Auster's friendly breath, Their burden light'ning, soon to Sunium shews The spreading sails. Two vessels, riding there, Receive embarking warriors. On the beach Looks Medon stedfast: By almighty Jove, He cries aloud, Themistocles I see! O Haliartus, O my holy friend, We must not leave unvisited a shore Which holds that living trophy to our view, The victor-chief at Salamis. The skiff Is launch'd; they land. Themistocles begins The salutation: Hail! OÃ¯leus' son, Thou rev'rend host of Athens, Timon, hail! Your unexpected presence here excites A pleasing wonder. Whither do ye steer These well remember'd vessels, which convey'd Thee, first of Locrians, with our Attic bard, To Salamis from Delphi? In that course Was Timon captive made, whom freed at last My joyful arms embrace. The Locrian here: To AtalantÃ©, in EubÅan streights, We steer; another of OÃ¯lean race, Through bounteous Heav'n a refuge there obtains, My brother, good Leonteus, with a band Of gallant Locrians, ready at my call To lift their bucklers in defence of Greece. But why, remote from Athens, on the strand Of naked Sunium, do I see the son Of Neocles, so recently by me At Sparta left? Themistocles replies: Forbear enquiry now, O virtuous branch Of that ennobled stock, th' OÃ¯lean house! If e'er my conduct merited thy praise, If thou believ'st me studious of the fame Which follows manly deeds, forbear to doubt Th' unwearied further efforts of my limbs, My heart, my talents: Secrecy matures, Time brings the labour of the mind to birth. Were those first steps reveal'd, which restless thought, Constructing some vast enterprize, ascends, How wild a wand'rer, Medon, would appear The policy of man! But, gen'rous chief, Whose valour, whose experience might assure A prosp'rous issue to a bold exploit, Say, should I open on some future day To thy discerning sight the clearest track, Where to success one glorious stride might reach, Wouldst thou be ready at my call? He paus'd. From such a mouth, such captivating words Insinuate sweetness through the Locrian's ear, Who feels th' allurement; yet, by prudence rul'd, This answer frames: Through such a glorious track Whoever guides, may challenge Medon's aid; Thou prove that guide, my steps shall follow close, Unless by Aristides call'd, whose voice Commands my service. Cool th' Athenian hides The smart his wounded vanity endures, And manly thus, unchang'd in look, rejoins: I ask no more; I rest my future claim On Medon's valour, only to support What Aristides shall approve, farewell. Avail thee straight of these propitious winds; In AtalantÃ©, known to me of old, What force thou can'st, assemble; dread no wants, I will be watchful to supply them all. They part. Now Medon, under hoisted sails, Remarks unwonted transport on the cheek Of Haliartus. O my peasant weeds, His joy exclaims, how gratefully you rise In my remembrance now! From you my hopes Forebode some benefit to Greece. Dear lord, Forbear enquiry; by yon hero warn'd, In secrecy my thoughts, till form'd complete, Lie deeply bury'd. Timon smil'd, and spake: I know, full often enterprises bold Lie in the womb of mystery conceal'd; Thus far th' Athenian hero and thyself Raise expectation; but I further know, His faculties are matchless, thou art brave, Unerring Medon like my god is wise; Thence expectation soars on steady wings. O light of Greece, Themistocles, exert Thy boundless pow'rs! mature thy pregnant plan! Whene'er the glorious mystery unveils, Me and my Delphians thou shalt find prepar'd. The turbulent Euripus swift they plough In pleasing converse thus, and clasp, in hope, Their anxious friends on AtalantÃ©'s shore. When ev'ry mast was hid by Sunium's cape, Thus to his faithful minister, the son Of Neocles: Sicinus, hast thou seen My followers on board? The treasures brought From Xerxes, those my spoils of war supply, The arms, the stores, Sicinus, has thy care Deposited in safety? Yes, replies Th' entrusted servant. Now thyself embark, His lord enjoins, who, musing thus, remains: If my attempt to further I have won This gallant Locrian, frankly I confess My debt to fortune; but this casual boon I can forego, if wantonly her hand Resumes; Themistocles alone can trace A path to glory. Tow'rds the land he turns, Proceeding thus: Now, Attica, farewell, Awhile farewell. To thee, Barbarian gold, Themistocles resorts; my bosom guest, Whom Aristides in disdain would spurn, By thee, O gift of Xerxes, I will raise The weal of Athens, and a fresh increase To my own laurels. Uncontroll'd, supreme Is Aristides. He the Attic youth In phalanx bright to victory may lead; Minerva's bird Xanthippus may display To Asia, trembling at their naval flag; A private man, Themistocles will reach Your summits, fellow citizens, preferr'd To his command. Ye chosen heroes, wait For breezy spring to wanton in your sails, Then range your vig'rous files, and pamper'd steeds; Themistocles, amid septentrion snows, Shall rouse despair and anguish from their den Of lamentation; poverty shall blaze In radiant steel; pale misery shall grasp A standard. Athens, thy rejected son Extorted aid from tyranny shall draw On his own greatness to establish thine. Swift he embarks, like Neptune when he mounts His rapid conch to call the tempests forth, Upturn the floods, and rule them when they rage. The third clear morning shews Eretria's port, Among EubÅan cities once superb, Eretria now in ashes. She had join'd Th' Athenians, bold invaders, who consum'd The capital of Lydia, to revenge Ionian Greeks enthrall'd. Eretria paid Severe atonement to Hystaspes' son, Incens'd Darius. To a Cissian plain, A central space of his unbounded realm, Far from their ancient seat, which flames devour'd, He her exterminated race confin'd, Sad captives, never to revisit more Their native isle. A silent wharf admits Themistocles on shore, a void extent, Where sons of Neptune heretofore had swarm'd. No mooring vessel in the haven rode, No footstep mark'd the ways; sole inmates there, Calamity and horror, as enthron'd, Sat on o'erwhelming ruins, and forbade The hero passage, till a seeming track Presents, half bury'd in surrounding heaps Of desolation, what appears a dome, Rais'd to some god. Themistocles observes A shatter'd porch, whose proud supporters lie In fragments, save one column, which upholds Part of a sculptur'd pediment, where, black By conflagration, an inscription maim'd Retains these words, âTo eleutherian Jove.â Th' Athenian enters, follow'd by his train In arms complete. Excluded was the day By ruins pil'd externally around, Unless what broken thinly-scatter'd rays Shot through th' encumber'd portal. Soon they stand Amidst obscuring dusk in silence all, All motionless in wonder, while a voice, Distinct in tone, delivers through the void These solemn accents: Eleutherian god! Since no redeemer to Eretria fall'n Thy will vouchsafes, why longer dost thou keep Thy aged servant on a stage of woe? Why not release him? why not close his eyes, So vainly melting o'er his country lost? Ten years are fled; the morning I have hail'd In sighs alone; have laid my head on thorns Of anguish, nightly visited in dreams By images of horror, which employ Each waking moment. To have seen destroy'd From their foundations my paternal streets, The holy structures burn, a people forc'd In climates new and barbarous to dwell, Was sure enough to sufferâIt is time To give my patience rest. The plaintive sound Draws on th' Athenian, who perceives a gleam, Pale-quiv'ring o'er a solitary lamp; Perceives a rev'rend sire, resembling Time, Down to whose girdle hangs the snowy fleece Of wintry age. Unaw'd his lamp he rais'd; A dim reflection from the polish'd arms Reveal'd the warrior, whom he thus bespake: Whate'er thou art, if hostile, or a friend, A god, a mortal, or a phantom vain, Know, that my state no change can render worse, All change make better. Father, soft replied Th' advancing chief, take comfort, I am come Thy country's saviour; follow, in the day See who I am. Between the op'ning band He leads the senior through the dusky porch, Whom he accosts before th' unclouded sun, Then vertical: Rest, father, and behold Themistocles of Athens. While the priest, So by his fillet sacerdotal known, In wonder paus'd, th' artificer divine Of wiles to catch the sudden turns of chance, Frames in a momentary cast of thought This bright device of fiction to allure A holy mind. O worthy of the god! Thou servant pure of Jupiter! I mourn, Like thee, Eretria, not like thee despond. Attend, thou righteous votary to heav'n! I, from the day of Salamis o'ertoil'd, While courting slumber, in a vision saw The sapient issue of th' almighty sire, His best belov'd Minerva. Still the sound Of her gorgonian shield my ears retain, While earnest, striking on its rim her spear, The virgin warrior spake: Triumphant son Of Neocles, remember in thy joy The miseries of others. Go, redeem Eretria fall'n, whose noble remnant arm'd Sev'n ships, exhausting all their slender stores, To fight for Athens on this glorious day. As from the sooty gate of direful Dis Deliver'd Theseus, when to cheering day He reascended, on Alcides look'd, Who for his lov'd companion piere'd the gloom Of Erebus; th' Eretrian's grateful eyes Thus on the son of Neocles were fix'd, In ecstacy of joy. These fervent words He utter'd: Heav'n hath giv'n thee to destroy Presumptuous foes, O favour'd by the gods! Who give thee now to save despairing friends; That, all-rejoicing in thy trophies new, Great as thou art, thy gen'rous soul may prove, How far beyond the transports conquest yields, Are those resulting from benignant deeds. More grateful, chief, is charity's sweet voice, Than Fame's shrill trumpet, in the ear of Jove, Who will, on such humanity as thine, Accumulate his blessings. If my name Thou ne'er hast heard, or, hearing, hast forgot, Know, that from lib'ral Cleobulus sprung, I am Tisander. Interrupting swift Th' Athenian here: Thy own, thy father's name, To me, illustrious pontiff, well are known. My recent banner in the summer's gale Thou must remember on th' Eretrian coast. Eretrian warriors under Cleon's charge, In ships by me supply'd, undaunted fought At Artemisium, and an earnest gave Of their late prowess. From their chief, from all Thy celebrating countrymen, I heard Of thee Tisander, and thy name retain; Proceed. To him the priest: Flow first my tears! Of that brave band whatever now remains Have nought but prowess left. Alas! how few Escap'd thy fell, exterminating hand, When treachery surrender'd to thy pow'r, Darius! Sons of husbandry lay hid In woods and caverns; of the nobler class Some on the main were absent. Priest of Jove I was releas'd; a pious, beardless prince, Nam'd Hyperanthes, on my rank and years Look'd with compassion; living, I extol, My dying breath shall bless him. I have dwelt Within my temple, mourning o'er this waste. Here, annually collected (Lo! the day Of that severe solemnity is nigh) Th' unhappy reliques of Eretrian blood Accompany my tears. Thou knowst, they sail'd At thy appointment, on Athenian decks, They and the men of Styra from that port For Salamis. In glory they return'd To want and horror, desert found their land, Their crops, their future sustenance destroy'd, Their huts consum'd, their cattle swept away, Their progeny, their wives; flagitious act Of Demonax, in Oreus late replac'd, Her tyrant foul, a slave to Xerxes' throne, His scourge in rich EubÅa, half-reduc'd To this dire monster's sway, by royal aid Of endless treasure, and Barbarian bands. Such is our state. Too scanty are the means Of willing Styra to relieve such wants; Our wealthier neighbours of Carystus vend, Not give; in hoarded grain, in flocks and herds Abounding, them a sordid chief controlls, Nicomachus. An oligarchy rules GerÃ¦stus small, but opulentââO Jove! I see brave Cleon yonder; from his head He rends the hairâwhat gestures of distress! He beats his troubled bosom, wrings his hands! Not heeding great Themistocles, he points On me alone a wild distracted look! Say Cleon . . . Swift, with shiv'ring lips and pale, Th' Eretrian leader, interrupting, vents His tortur'd thoughts: Tisander, can thy pray'rs Repel grim famine, rushing on the blast Of barren winter? Three disastrous days Will lay the combatants for Greece in dust, Behind them leaving nothing but a name For Salamis to publish. Lo! they come, A dying people, suppliant to repose Within thy fane their flesh-divested bones. Yet such a tomb, their fainting voices cry, May those Eretrians envy who are doom'd To lodge their captive limbs in Asia's mold. He ends in sighs. Behold, a ghastly troop Slow through the ruins of their native streets In languid pace advance! So gath'ring shoals Of ghosts from hour to hour through endless time, The unrelenting eye of Charon views, By sickness, plague and famine, by the sword, Or heart-corroding sorrow, sent from light To pass the black irremeable floods Of Styx. Cecropia's hero cast a look Like PhÅbus heav'nly-gentle, when, aton'd, Th' infectious air he clear'd, awak'ning gales To breathe salubrious o'er th' enfeebled host Of Agamemnon, as from death they rose Yet to assert their glory. Swift the chief Bespake Sicinus: Haste, unlaid the ships; Three talents bring; they, Cleon, shall be thine; Seek those in every part who vend, not give. The gifts of Ceres in profusion bear, The gifts of Pan, the grape's reviving juice, To these, my fellow warriors, who have seen My banner streaming, twice have lent their aid To my renown; meantime our naval food Shall be their portion; vesture now shall cheer Their limbs. My brave companions, I have brought The spear and buckler for your manly hands; Your strength restor'd shall feel the glorious weight Of crested helms. Tisander, let them rest Within thy shelt'ring temple, not to sink Beneath distress, but vig'rous soon renew Their practis'd race of honour. Pass, my friends, Be mute; expression of your joy I wave; Again to-morrow you and I will meet. Tisander, happy, entertains his guests, Twelve hundred countrymen, the last remains Of populous Eretria. Plenty's boon Alert the Attic mariners diffuse To all, and cordial tend their wants; discreet Sicinus curbs excess. The tidings brought Of his performance from a short repast Dismiss'd his lord applauding; who serene, Stretch'd on his naval pillow, slept till dawn. He rose. To him Sicinus: Will my lord Permit his servant, with an active band Of sailors, these obstructions to remove, Or so dispose, that feeblest steps may sind A passage free to good Tisander's fane; That through its wonted apertures, the round Of that huge pile, where Jupiter should dwell, Now dark as Pluto's palace, may admit The light of heav'n? Yet further, we must search For coverts dry, if such the greedy flames Have left among these ruins, to secure The various stores, which Cleon may transport. To him his lord: Go, monitor expert, Accomplish what thou counsel'st. Tow'rds the fane Himself not slow proceeds. Before the front, On scatter'd fragments of their ancient homes, Th' Eretrians, pale with long-continu'd want, Are seated. Thick as winter-famish'd birds Perch on the boughs, which icicles encrust, Yet chirp and flutter in th' attemp'ring sun, These, at the hero's presence, wave their hands, Unite their efforts in acclaim not loud, But cordial, rather in a gen'ral sigh Of gratitude. The charitable care Of his best warriors, some of noblest birth, Impart their help, like parents to a race Of tender infants. Once of might approv'd In battle, hardiest of the naval breed, Th' Eretrians, worn by hunger, scarce retain The slender pow'rs of childhood. One by one Themistocles consoles them, and devotes In condescension sedulous the day To kindness not impolitic. In these His piercing genius fit materials saw To build another structure of renown. Ere he retires, Tisander thus he greets: Wilt thou, O father! on my board bestow An evening hour? My moments all belong To this yet helpless people, said the priest. Such pious care through me shall heav'n reward, Exclaims the chief, as round him he remarks The toiling sailors; soon, thou guardian good Of wretched men committed to thy charge, Soon shall thy temple reassume its state. Prepare an altar; Hecatombs again Shall smoke ere long, Eretria cast aside Her widow'd garb, and lift her festive palms To eleutherian Jove. This utter'd, swift He seeks his vessel, while the sun descends. Calm, as in summer, through an ether clear Aurora leads the day. A cheerful sound Of Oxen, lowing from the hollow dales Which tow'rds Carystus wind, of bleeting sheep, Yet nearer driven across the Eretrian plain, Awake Themistocles. His couch he leaves, Revisiting the temple; there enjoys The gen'ral transport. Plenty on the wing Is nigh, the comforts of her fruitful horn To pour on desolation. Cleon comes, Accosting thus Themistocles: My task Is well accomplish'd through the lib'ral zeal Of Hyacinthus near a youth unlike His sire Nicomachus. That subtile chief Of our Carystian neighbours is behind, Escorting laden carriages of grain, Thy purchase; nought his sordid hand bestows. He, curious more than friendly in our need, Or of thy name respectful, to explore, Not help or pity, hither bends his course. Conduct the father to my ship, reply'd Themistocles; sure yonder is the son, Thou hast describ'd; ingenuous are his looks. Like him, whose name he bears, his beauteous form Might charm the beaming god once more to court A mortal's friendship; but, dejection pale O'ercasts his hue; strange melancholy dims His youthful eye; too modest, or unmann'd By languor, child of grief, he stops and bows In distant, seeming awe, which wounds my soul. I must salute him: Noble youth, receive My hand; Themistocles of Greece expects No such obeisance from a fellow Greek. The majesty of Athens might exact That conquer'd tyrants, in my presence brought, Low as the dust should crouch beneath her chief. A start of anguish Hyacinthus gave At these last words, then silent bow'd again His decent brow; not awe, but latent ills Seem'd to control his tongue. Th' observant chief Defers enquiry to its season due, To Cleon's charge consigns him, and retires To his own galley. Waiting for the sire, He meditates a moment on the son: I see advantage in this youth's distressâ My plan is form'd. He hastens to unbar His copious treasure; thence in dazzling show He spreads four silver talents on his board, O'er them a mantle throws, and brief again Thus ruminates: Now, Plutus, who canst sap The strong-bas'd tow'r, and soften rigid hearts, Smile on this juncture. Aristides scorns Thy deity, Themistocles invokes Thy precious succour. From profoundest woe Disconsolate Eretria thou hast rais'd; Now by a sordid instrument give life To dull Carystus. Sudden in his view, By Cleon brought, who instantly withdraws, Nicomachus appears, and thus begins: The Salaminian victor I salute, Charg'd by Carystus; happy is my lot To venerate the chief, and touch the hand Which humbled Asia. Doth EubÅa see Thee visitant illustrious to rebuild Eretria? then instruct her to confine That pow'r and pride, her neighbours felt of old. Th' Athenian here: EubÅa sees me come Both to upraise, Carystian, and depress; But to exalt thy state, my friend, I wish, Wish thy possessions equal to thy worth. Behold! Uplifting to the greedy eye Of avarice the mantle, he pursues; Behold, four silver talents! Them accept, Which in this casket to thy trusted slaves I will deliver now; I only ask Of thy deep-founded influence to warm Supine Carystus: For thyself and Greece Unite with mine thy standard. Further note, If at my summons thou produce in arms Thy citizens auxiliar, from this hand Expect four added talents; but the hopes Of no unpractis'd leader, who perceives His enterprize assur'd, dare promise more, A share, Nicomachus, of spoil in war, To pass thy own belief. By present gain, By more in promise, not by glory fir'd, Nicomachus rejoins: A thousand spears Shall wait thy earliest notice. While he spake, He snatch'd the casket, shut the treasure close, Then rush'd to seek his confidential slave, Who takes the precious charge. With placid looks The cool the politic Athenian sat Like some experienc'd pilot, who serene, In skilful guidance of the steady helm, Enjoys the favour smooth of gale and tide, Combin'd to waft o'er ocean's fickle breast His gliding keel, and lodge her costly freight Secure at length in harbour. Now he spake To his re-ent'ring guest: Carystian friend, Thou hast a son, well-disciplin'd to war, Brave, lib'ral, wise, I doubt not; wilt thou trust To my society a while his youth? He is the object of my vows to heav'n, Nicomachus exclaims, in passion feign'd, My soul's delight, the rapture of my eye! If he were absent, ev'ry hour my age Would feel a growing burden. Come, rejoins Th' Athenian, him I only would detain My messenger of orders to thy walls; On him another talent would bestow. The gymnic school and letters, cries the sire, He follows, heeds not treasure; by his hand Send me the talent; never let him know The charge he bears. This said, he loudly calls To Hyacinthus, who had gain'd the deck, Him ent'ring thus addresses: Son, the chief Of Athens, great Themistocles, demands Thee for companion. As a casual gleam Breaks through th' unrav'lling texture of black clouds, Which long on winter's sullen face have hung; So darts a ray of gladness through the gloom Of Hyacinthus, by the Attic chief Not unobserv'd. Intent on swift return, Th' exulting father bids to both farewel. Remaining day Themistocles employs Among his sailors in th' Eretrian streets, Inspects the necessary toil pursu'd With unremitted vigour, then retires To due refection. Cleon is a guest With Hyacinthus, still by grief devour'd Which all his efforts strive in vain to hide. Her heavy wing no sooner night outspreads, Than to Sicinus they are giv'n in charge, While to his couch Themistocles repairs. End of the Eleventh Book. BOOK the Twelfth. Now in the zodiac had the sun o'erpass'd The tenth fair sign. The new succeeding month, Though not by Flora, nor Vertumnus deck'd, Nor green in hue, though first of winter's train, Oft with unsully'd skies irradiate cheers The prone creation, and delights mankind. The birds yet warble on the leafless sprays, The placid surface, glaz'd by clearest light, In crystal rivers, and transparent lakes, Or ocean's smooth cerulean bosom, shews The finny tribes in play. The active son Of Neocles uprises, and descries A dawn which promis'd purity of air, Of light and calmness, tempting sloth herself To action. Thus he rous'd his native fire: Of this kind season not a moment lose, Themistocles. Sicinus ever nigh He call'd: Provide two receptacles sure, Each to contain twelve talents; bring my arms, Produce a second suit, resembling mine; Send Hyacinthus; let my chosen band Of Attic friends, and Sparta's fifty youths, My followers, be ready for a march. Soon Hyacinthus enters; still he shews The perturbation of a mind oppress'd By some conceal'd misfortune, while, beneath The shade of sorrow, on his front appear'd Excelling graces. Him the chief bespake, Gay in his look, and sprightly in his tone: Her eastern hill, behold, the morning mounts In radiance, scatter'd from the liquid gems On her loose mantle; but the heart of youth In ev'ry season should rejoice, in clouds Not less than sunshine, whether nature's voice Be hoarse in storms, or tune to whisp'ring gales Her vernal music. Sharp some inward grief, When youth is sad; yet fortune oft deceives The inexperienc'd by imagin'd ills, Or light, which counsel of the more mature Can lightly heal. Unlock thy lib'ral mind; To me, a guardian pregnant of relief Beyond thy father, countrymen, or friends, Impart thy cares. The sighing guest replied: To thy controul my service I devote, O scourge of tyrants, but retain my grief! Which thou, O first of mortals, or the king Of high Olympus, never can redress. Sicinus interrupts; his lord's commands Are all accomplish'd. Now, Carystian friend, Resembling me in stature, size and limbs, The son of Neocles proceeds, accept That suit of armour; I have tried it well; Receive a shield familiar to my arm. He next instructs Sicinus: Thou receive Twelve talents; hasten to the neighb'ring walls Of stately Chalcis, populous and rich, Queen of EubÅan cities, in whose port The twenty ships of Athens yet remain, Which Chalcis borrow'd, and equipp'd for war. Of her bold race four thousand we beheld Distinguish'd late in Artemisium's fight, At Salamis yet later. First approach The new-made archon in a rev'rent style, Timoxenus most potent in that state, A dubious, timid magistrate, unlike Nearchus. Cordial salutation bear To him, my brave associate; do not turn Thy back on Chalcis, till thy prudence brings Intelligence of weight; th' Athenian keels With grain abundant and materials lade, That friendly roofs th' Eretrians may obtain, Before grim winter harrow up these streights Unnavigable soon. This said, he arms; Begirt by warriors, to the temple speeds, And greets the priest: In gladsome thought I see The goddess Health, white-handed, crimson-cheek'd, As from a silver car in roseate clouds Look on thy people; dropping on their lips Restoring dew, she bids them taste and live. The convalescent piously employ In labours, where my naval band shall join, To free th' encumber'd temple, to repair, To cover dwellings, lest the winter bring New hardships. Martial exercise I leave To Cleon's care, while ten revolving suns Of absence I must count. Now, father, take This hand, a hand which fortune and thy god Have ever favour'd, which shall soon convert The annual day of mourning in thy fane To festival solemnity of joy. Bless'd by Tisander, rapid he departs. Young Hyacinthus follows, who in arms, Once by his patron worn, to ev'ry eye Presents a new Themistocles, but such, As when th' allurement of his early bloom He, not unconscious of the charm, display'd To Attic damsels. Cloudless on their march Apollo shoots a clear and tepid ray; A scatter'd village in Carystian bounds To rural hospitality admits The wearied warriors. Hyacinthus guides His great protector to a shelt'ring fane Of Juno, styl'd connubial; stately round Old beech extend a venerable shade; Through ages time had witness'd to their growth, Whose ruddy texture, disarray'd of green, Glows in the purple of declining day. They pass the marble threshold, when the youth With visage pale, in accents broken spake: Unequall'd man, behold the only place For thy reception fit; for mine. . . He paus'd; A gushing torrent of impetuous grief O'erwhelm'd his cheeks; now starting, on he rush'd, Before the sacred image wrung his hands; Then sinking down, along the pavement roll'd His body; in distraction would have dash'd His forehead there. Themistocles prevents, Uplifts, and binds him in a strong embrace; When thus in eager agony the youth: Is not thy purpose, godlike man, to crush The tyrant Demonax, in torture cut The murd'rer short, that he may feel the pangs Of death unnatural? Young man, replies Th' Athenian grave, to know my hidden thoughts, Dost thou aspire, retaining still thy own? Still in my presence thy distemper drinks The cup of misery conceal'd, and seems, Rejecting friendship's salutary hand, To court the draught which poisons. Canst thou hope, Mysterious youth, my confidence, yet none Wilt in Themistocles repose? His look, His tone, in feign'd austerity he wrapp'd, So Ãsculapius bitter juice apply'd From helpful plants, his wisdom had explor'd, The vehicles of health. In humble tears, Which melted more than flow'd, the mourner thus: Forgive me, too regardless of thy grace; Of all forgetful, save itself, my grief Deserves thy frown, yet less than giddy joy, Which, grown familiar, wantons in the smile Of condescension. Ah! that grief will change Reproof to more than pity; will excite A thirst for vengeance, when thy justice hears A taleâUnfold it, interpos'd the chief, To one who knows the various ways of men, Hath study'd long their passions and their woes, Nor less the med'cines for a wounded mind. Then Hyacinthus: Mighty chief, recal Thy first successes, when Euboea's maids Saw from her shores Barbarian pendants low'r'd To thine, and grateful pluck'd the flow'rs of May To dress in chaplets thy victorious deck. Then, at thy gen'rous instigation fir'd, The men of Oreus from their walls expell'd Curst Demonax, their tyrant. On a day, Ah! source of short delight, of lasting pain! I from the labour of a tedious chace, O'erspent by thirst and heat, a forest gain'd. A rill, meandring to a green recess, I track'd; my wonder saw a damsel there In sumptuous vesture, couch'd on fragrant tufts Of camomile, amid surrounding flow'rs Reposing. Tall, erect a figure stern Was nigh; all sable on his head and brow, Above his lip, and shadowing his cheeks The hair was brisled; fierce, but frank his eye A grim fidelity reveal'd; his belt Sustain'd a sabre; from a quiver full On sight of me an arrow keen he drew, A well-strung bow presented, my approach Forbidding loudly. She, upstarting, wak'd. My aspect, surely gentle when I first Beheld Cleora, more of hope than fear Inspir'd; she crav'd protectionâWhat, ye fates! Was my protectionâO superior man, Can thy sublimity of soul endure My tedious anguish! Interposing mild Th' Athenian here: Take time, give sorrow vent, My Hyacinthus, I forbid not tears. He now pursues: her suppliant hands she rais'd, To me astonish'd, hearing from her lips, That Demonax was author of her days. Amid the tumult his expulsion caus'd, She, from a rural palace, where he stor'd Well known to her a treasure, with a slave In faith approv'd, with gold and gems of price Escap'd. All night on fleetest steeds they rode, Nor knew what hospitable roof to seek. My father's sister, GlaucÃ©, close behind This fane of Juno dwelt, her priestess pure, My kindest parent. To her roof I broughtâ O GlaucÃ© whatâO dearest, most rever'd! To thee I brought Cleora! Horror pale Now blanch'd his visage, shook his loos'ning joints, Congeal'd his tongue, and rais'd his rigid hair. Th' Athenian calm and silent waits to hear The reassum'd narration. O ye flow'rs, How were ye fragrant! forth in transport wild Bursts Hyacinthus: O embow'ring woods, How soft your shade's refreshment! Founts and rills How sweet your cadence, while I won the hand Of my Cleora to the nuptial tie, By spotless vows before thy image bound, O Goddess hymeneal! O what hours Of happiness untainted, dear espous'd, Did we possess! kind GlaucÃ© smil'd on both. The earliest birds of morning to her voice Of benediction sung; the gracious sound Our evening heard; content our pillow smooth'd. Ev'n Oxus, so Cleora's slave was nam'd, Of Sacian birth, with grim delight and zeal Anticipates our will. My nuptials known Brings down my father, whose resentment warm Th' affinity with Demonax reproves, A helpless vagabond, a hopeless wretch; For now thy sword at Salamis prevail'd. This storm Cleora calm'd; the gen'rous fair Before my father laid her dazzling gems; She gave, he took them all; return'd content; Left us too happy in exhaustless stores Of love for envious fate to leave unspoil'd. Meantime no rumour pierc'd our tranquil bow'r, That Demonax in Oreus was replac'd; That he two golden talents to the hand, Which should restore Cleora, had proclaim'd, To me was all unknown. Two moons complete Have spent their periods since one evening late Nicomachus my presence swift requir'd, A dying mother to embrace. By morn I gain'd Carystus; by the close of day A tender parent on my breast expir'd. An agitation unexpected shook My father's bosom as I took farewell. On my returnâI can no moreâYes, yes, Dwell on each hideous circumstance, my tongue; With horror tear my heartstrings till they burst: Poor Hyacinthus hath no cure but death. The sun was broad at noon; my recent loss Lamenting, yet asswaging by the joy To see Cleora soon, ne'er left before, (A tedious interval to me) I reach'd My home, th' abode of GlaucÃ©. Clos'd, the door Forbids my passage; to repeated calls No voice replies; two villagers pass by, Who at my clamours help to force my way. I pass one chamber; strangled on the floor, Two damsel-ministers of Juno lie. I hurry on; a second, where my wife Was in my absence to partake the couch Of GlaucÃ©, shews that righteous woman dead. The dear impression where Cleora's limbs Sleep had embrac'd, I saw, the only trace Of her, the last, these eyes shall e'er behold. Her name my accents strong in frenzy sound: Cleora makes no answer. Next I fly From place to place; on Sacian Oxus call: He is not there. A lethargy benumbs My languid members. In a neighb'ring hut, Lodg'd by the careful peasants, I awake, Insensible to knowledge of my state. The direful tidings from Carystus rouse My friends; Nicanor to my father's home Transports me. Ling'ring, torpid I consum'd Sev'n moons successive; when too vig'rous youth Recall'd my strength and memory to curse Health, sense, and thought. My rashness would have sought Cleora ev'n in Oreus, there have fac'd The homicide her sire; forbid, with-held, Nicanor I deputed. When I march'd To bid thee welcome, on the way I met That friend return'dâPersist, my falt'ring tongue, Rehearse his tidings; pitying Heav'n may close Thy narrative in deathâThe Sacian slave Produc'd Cleora to her savage sire; So fame reports, all Oreus so believes. But this is trivial to the tragic scene Which all beheld. Her hand the tyrant doom'd To Mindarus, a Persian lord, the chief Of his auxiliar guard; but she refus'd, And own'd our union, which her pregnant fruit Of love too well confirm'd. The monster, blind With mad'ning fury, instantly decreed That deadliest poison through those beauteous lips Should choak the springs of life. My weeping friend Saw her pale reliques on the fun'ral pyre. I am not madâev'n that relief the gods Deny me. All my story I have told, Been accurate on horror to provoke The stroke of death, yet live. . . Thou must, exclaims The chief, humanely artful, thou must live; Without thy help I never can avenge On Demonax thy wrongs. Ha! cries the youth, Art thou resolv'd to lift thy potent arm Against the murd'rer? Yes, th' Athenian said, I will do more, thy virtue will uphold, Whose perseverance through such floods of woe Could wade to bid me welcome. Gen'rous youth, Trust to the man whom myriads ne'er withstood, Who towns from ruin can to greatness raise, Can humble fortune, force her fickle hand To render up the victim she hath mark'd For shame and forrow, force her to entwine With her own finger a triumphant wreath To deck his brow. Themistocles, who drives Despair and desolation from the streets Of fall'n Eretria, and from eastern bonds Afflicted Greece at Salamis preserv'd; He will thy genius to his native pow'rs Restore; will make thee master of revenge For thy own wrongs; to glorious action guide Thy manly steps, redressing, as they tread, The wrongs of others. Not the gracious voice Of Juno, speaking comfort from her shrine, Not from his tripod Jove's prophetic seed, Imparting counsel through his Pythian maid, Not Jove himself, from DodonÃ¦an groves, By oracles of promise could have sooth'd This young, but most distinguish'd of mankind Among the wretched, as the well-wrought strain Of thy heart-searching policy, expert Themistocles, like some well-practis'd son Of learn'd Machaon, o'er a patient's wound Compassionate, but cool, who ne'er permits His own sensation to control his art. But, said th' Athenian, soldiers must refresh, As well as fast, nor keep incessant watch. They quit the temple. In the dwelling nigh Deep-musing Hyacinthus lightly tastes The light repast. On matted tufts they stretch Their weary'd limbs. Themistocles had arm'd With elevated thoughts his pupil's mind, Which foils at intervals despair. His eyes The transient palm of sleep would often seal, But oft in dreams his dear espous'd he sees, A livid spectre; an empoison'd cup She holds, and weepsâthen vanishes. Revenge, In bloody sandals and a dusky pall, Succeeds. Her stature growing, as he gaz'd, Reveals a glory, beaming round her head; A sword she brandishes, the awful sword Which Nemesis unsheathes on crimes. He sees Connubial Juno's image from the base Descend, and, pointing with its marble hand, Before him glide. A sudden shout of war, The yell of death, Carystian banners wav'd, An apparition of himself in arms, Stir ev'ry sense. The dreadful tumult ends; The headless trunk of Demonax in gore He views in transport. Instantly his couch Shoots forth in laurels, vaulting o'er his head; The walls are hung with trophies. Juno comes, No longer marble, but the queen of heav'n, Clad in resplendency divine. She leads Cleora, now to perfect bloom restor'd, Who, beck'ning, opens to th' enraptur'd eye Of Hyacinthus, doating on the charm, Her breast of snow; whence pure ambrosial milk Allures an infant from an amber cloud, Who stoops, and round her neck maternal clings. He to embrace them striving, wak'd and lost Th' endearing picture of illusive air, But wak'd compos'd. His mantle he assum'd, To Juno's statue trod, and thus unlock'd His pious breast: O goddess! though thy smile, Which I acknowledge for the hours of bliss I once possess'd, a brief, exhausted term, Could not protect me from malignant fate, Lo! prostrate fall'n before thee, I complain No more. My soul shall struggle with despair; Nor shall the furies drag me to the grave. Thou punishment dost threaten to the crime, Which hath defac'd my happiness on earth; Themistocles, my patron, is thy boon, Who will fulfil thy menace. I believe, There is a place hereafter to admit Such purity as hers, whose blissful hand Thou didst bestowâI lostâI know my days With all their evils of duration short; I am not conscious of a black misdeed, Which should exclude me from the seat of rest, And therefore wait in pious hope, that soon Shall Hyacinthus find his wife and child With them to dwell forever. He concludes, Regains the chamber, and Aurora shines. End of the Twelfth Book. BOOK the Thirteenth. When Hyacinthus first his couch forsook Themistocles in care had follow'd close, But secretly had noted well the pray'r To Juno sent, and part approving, part Condemning, heard. Accoutr'd now in mail, The young Carystian, to his list'ning friend, Relates the wonders of his recent dream. Th' Athenian, while most cordial in the care Of Hyacinthus, whom his woes endear'd, Still weigh'd his use. This answer he devis'd To ease the grief he pitied, and preserve The worth essential to his own designs. What thou hast told, Carystian, fires my breast; It was a signal, by Saturnia held To animate thy rage, and prompt thy arm To action. She requires not, goddess wise, Humiliation, scorns the sluggish mind, Whose thoughts are creeping to Elysian rest. They hush no throbs of anguish, while it rends The mangled heartstrings, no not more than staunch A bleeding wound, or quench a fever's flame. We earn Elysium, and our evils here Surmount, alike by action. Manly toil Repels despair. Endurance of a storm, Which rocks the vessel, marches long and swift, A river pass'd, while enemies in front By whirls of javelins chase the rapid ford, A rampart scal'd, the forcing of a camp, Are cures of sorrow. In her vision clear So did heav'n's empress intimate this morn. Me too she visited in sleep; her voice My waking thoughts confirm'd; Cleora lives; Else why the goddess thus: Arise, O son Of Neocles, of this afflicted youth Be thou sure guide to rescue his espous'd; The profanation of my rites chastise. The fiction wraps in credulous delight The young Carystian's confidence, who feels CircÃ¦an magic from his patron's eye, His tongue, and gesture. He, quick-sighted, turns To swift advantage his delusion thus: Come, let me try thy vigour; I am bound To neighb'ring Styra; fly before thy friend; Among that gen'rous people, who, their all, Two gallies fent to Salamis, proclaim Themistocles approaches. Like a dart, Lanc'd from the sinews of a Parthian's arm, Without reply th' inspir'd Carystian flew, Cas'd as he was in steel. Meantime the chief Salutes his Attic and Laeonian bands; His captivating presence both enjoy, Which else no eye most piercing might discern, Not ev'n the hundred never-sleeping lights, Which on the margin of her parent flood Incessant watch'd the progeny transform'd Of Inachus, the Argive watry god; Where undistinguish'd in the grazing herd His daughter wept, nor he that daughter knew A speechless suppliant. Recommenc'd, the march Exhausts the day. Beneath a holy roof, Which rose to Ceres, they their shelter'd limbs To rest and food resign. There gently swell'd Th' encircling ground, whence fair the morning smil'd On little Styra, who, no queen superb Of wide dominion, like a rural nymph In decency of garb, and native locks, Her humble circuit not unlovely shews. She from Athenian boundaries of old Her first inhabitants deriv'd, and pours Her sons now forth Themistocles to greet, Their eldest parent's hero. Lampon bold Accosts him: Me the weak, but willing hand Of Styra late enabled to enrol My name with thine, unconquerable son Of Neocles. Though feeble is her sword, Her sinews boast of Attic vigour still. Oh! that her means were equal to her love, A lib'ral welcome thou and these should find; But yon GerÃ¦stian oligarchy, foe To equity and freedom, from our meads Have newly swept our plenty. Ardent here, Themistocles: By heav'n, my Styrian host, Not thrice shall day illuminate your skies, Ere double measure shall these petty lords Repay to Styra. I am come to crush Their usurpation, in GerÃ¦stus fix Her ancient laws, and rouse her martial race Against the Persian, and the Persian's friends. Array thy force. Tomorrow's early sun Shall see us march, and ere his second noon The bird of Athens shall her talons lift Against the walls of these presumptuous thieves. They have no walls, Eudemus takes the word, A righteous, brave GerÃ¦stian, exil'd late, By hospitable Styra late receiv'd. A forest thick surrounds them, which affords One scanty passage; but the ax and bill, Apply'd with vigour, soon will open ways. Sev'n hundred natives can GerÃ¦stus arm, Who will not fight to rivet on their necks A galling yoke more fast. The whole defence, Our oligarchal tyrants have to boast, Are poor Barbarians, scarce three hundred strong, Sav'd from the wrecks of those advent'rous ships, Which round EubÅa's rude Capharean cape Had been detach'd thy navy to surround In Artemisium's conflict. Now apart Themistocles to Hyacinthus spake, While in his care he lodg'd a casket seal'd, Which held the talent promis'd to his sire: This for thy father; tell him, I require The stipulated bands' immediate march; I wish to see them under thy command. Thou know'st Diana's celebrated fane At Amarynthus; if thou canst, young friend, Be there before me. Pleas'd, the youth departs. As in excursion from their waxen homes A hive's industrious populace obey The tinkling sound, which summons all to swarm; So, when the trumpet's well-known voice proclaims To arms, the Styrians, round the banner'd staff, Which Lampon rais'd, are gather'd. There enjoin'd To reassemble at a stated hour, Their clinking armour in their homes they cleanse; They whet their spears and falchions to chastise GerÃ¦stian rapine. Ere the morning breaks, Four hundred join Themistocles. He bends To Amarynthus, seat of Dian pure, His rapid course. Her edifice sublime, Which overtops her consecrated bow'r, The second noon discovers. Just arriv'd, Carystian helmets round the temple shine, By Hyacinthus and Nicanor led, Joint captains. Staid Nicanor was the friend Return'd from Oreus, who the tidings brought Of poor Cleora's fate. Th' Athenian hails The young commander: Gladly do I find Thy speed surpassing mine; but swift explain, Who is the priestess in this pure abode? Then Hyacinthus: She, Eudora nam'd, For sanctity of manners, rank and birth, Through this well-people'd island is renown'd; Authority her hand-maid. Her rich fane With sumptuous off'rings shines; the wealthiest towns Her intercession at the thrones of heav'n Obsequious court, and dread her brow severe. Of elevated stature, awful port, She from Briareus, worshipp'd in our walls, Proud origin derives. She twangs the bow, The javelin lances through the tusky boar, Chac'd o'er the temple's wide domain of wood; Tall nymphs attend her, while the eyes abash'd Of her own vassals shun her stately step. Ah! couldst thou win her favour!. . . Haste, replies The ready chief, to great Eudora say, Themistocles of Athens humbly sues To kiss the border of her hallow'd stole. He calls; the martial harness from his limbs Attentive slaves unclasp; ablution pure From limpid streams effaces ev'ry stain Of his laborious march; a chlamys flows Loose from his shoulders. Casting from his brow The plumed casque, uncover'd he ascends The massy steps of that stupendous fane. In admiration of the glories there, Through cedar valves, on argent hinges pois'd, He passes, where his own distinguish'd form No ornament excells. In gold the shapes Of wreaths and garlands, crescents, stars, and suns, Hung round the columns; on the pavement broad, Engraven tripods, vases, statues, busts Of burnish'd brass and silver were dispos'd, In graceful order. Pictures, where the lips Seem speaking, limbs to act, and looks express The various passions, which in varying hues Exalt the human aspect, or degrade, Enrich the walls. Orion writhes his bulk, Transfix'd by arrows from th' insulted queen Of chastity. Devour'd by rav'nous hounds, His own, ActÃ¦on's metamorphos'd head Reclines in blood his newly-branching horns. Unbid by Åneus to th' Ãtolian feast, There on her vengeful Calydonian boar Looks PhÅbe down, while red her crescent darts A flame of anger through disparting clouds. Compell'd to lave her violated limbs, Disrob'd Calisto on the fountain's brink There weeps in vain her virgin vow profan'd. Here deeds of Mercy smile. Appeas'd, the queen Folds in the mantle of a silver mist Pale Iphigenia, from the holy knife At Aulis wafts, and substitutes the doe A full-atoning victim. Here she quits Her Tauric dome, unhospitably stain'd With blood of strangers. O'er th' entrusted keel, Of sad Orestes, who her image bears, To chace the Furies from his haunted couch, A guardian bland she hovers. Through its length Magnificent the midmost isle conveys The terminating sight, where deep and wide A luminous recess, half-circling, shews Pilasters chisell'd, and a sumptuous freeze. An elevated pavement, yet below The sight, whose level skims a surface broad Of marble green, sustains the goddess form In Parian whiteness, emblem of her state, In height five cubits. Purity severe O'ershades her beauty. Elegantly group'd Without confusion, dryads, oreads round, With nymphs of lakes and fountains fill the space. Lo! not unlike the deity she serves, Eudora stands before her, and accosts Th' advancing hero thus: I trust, thy soul Some great, some righteous enterprize conceives Else nothing less might justify the din Of arms around me, and these banners proud Fix'd in my presence on religious ground Inviolably sacred. I would know, Themistocles, thy purpose. He one knee Obsequious bends; his lips approach the hem Of her pontific robe, nor she forbids. He then replied: I should not have besought Thy condescension, priestess, had my soul Less than a righteous enterprize conceiv'd, Deserving sanction from thy holy, pure, All-influencing wisdom; to thy feet I bring my standard, and my sword devote Spontaneous to thy service. While I cast My wond'ring eyes on this enrich'd abode, On thee, its chief embellishment, and know That impious neighbours in GerÃ¦stus rule, Foul pillagers and miscreants, horror thrills Thy soldier's bosom; from a town oppress'd Them to extirpate his vindictive arm Themistocles exalts. Eudora look'd Applauding: Go, and prosper, she rejoin'd; Of this attentive piety, O chief, Whom glory crowns, thou never shalt repent! Dismiss'd, he rested; under twilight grey Renew'd his course. Meridian PhÅbus view'd Compact battalions from their shields and helms Shoot flames of terror on GerÃ¦stian woods. A guard was station'd, where the narrow path Gave entrance; thither Hyacinthus led A chosen troop, and fierce in accent spake: Train'd to an oar, vile remnants of a wreck, Drop, ye Barbarian vagabonds, those arms From your ignoble, mercenary hands; Th' invincible Themistocles requires Immediate passage. Dubious paus'd their chief, A low Pamphylian rower. In contempt From his inverted spear a pond'rous blow The youth discharg'd, removing all suspence. Prone fell the ruffian, like the victim beast, Stunn'd by a brawny sacrificer's blow, Before an altar's fire. His troop disperse. The Styrians active, by the prudent son Of Neocles instructed, beat the wood, Wielding the bill and ax in wary dread Of ambush. No resistance checks the march; The speeding legion penetrates the shades; Thence rushing dreadful on GerÃ¦stus spreads A blaze of steel. So fiery sparks, conceal'd Long in some ancient mansion's girding beam, There gath'ring force unseen, a passage break For conflagration to devour a town. Eudemus joins Themistocles, and thus: Behold, our miscreant oligarchy rest On supplication, now their sole defence; The injur'd people follow; hear the cry Of imprecation. Sev'n flagitious men, By rapine, lust, and homicide deform'd, Those olive boughs profaning by their touch, Come to pollute thy presence. They approach, To whom th' Athenian, stern in visage, spake: Ye little tyrants, who in crimes aspire To emulate the greatest, do ye come To render up your persons? else expect That populace to seize you, and a pile Of stones to crush your execrable heads. He turns away. The fife and trumpet sound; The sev'n surrender mute; Eudemus glad Secures them, giv'n to Styra's band in charge. Reviv'd GerÃ¦stus to her public place, Which heretofore the people wont to fill In free assembly, as her guardian god Receives the Attic hero. All the way He passes, curses on the tyrants heap'd He list'ning hears, from children for their sires, From wives for husbands, mothers for their sons, The various victims of unlawful pow'r. Dishonour'd damsels, early robb'd of fame, An orphan train, of heritage despoil'd, Indignant husbands, of their wives depriv'd, Their joint upbraidings sound. By all the gods, Th' Athenian bitterly sarcastic spake, Black spirits, your fertility in vice Deserves my wonder; in this narrow spot You are distinguish'd in the sight of heav'n By multifarious crimes above the king, Who hath all Asia for his ample range. Be not offended, my GerÃ¦stian friends; Ere I restore your franchise I will try If chains and dungeons can allay these flames Of unexampled wickedness. Thou hear'st, Eudemus. Now, GerÃ¦stians, you are free. Elect Eudemus archon; of the wealth, Those wretches gather'd, part to public use, To suff'rers part distribute. I demand But this requital; you have felt the woes Of tyranny; obtaining from my hand Redress, that hand enable to preserve The liberty of others; Greece demands From you that succour, which this happy day She hath by me imparted. He withdraws From acclamations and assenting hearts To give Eudemus counsel. Night is spent. He swiftly back to Amarynthus flies; Each tyrant follows; from his dungeon drawn, The sun, spectator of his chains and shame, He dreads; in horror, conscious of his guilt, He shrinks at day like Cerberus, when dragg'd By Hercules from hell. Th' accepted chief, His captives ranging in Eudora's sight, Unfolds their dire variety of crimes, Left to her sentence; awful she decides: He, who oppresses, who enslaves mankind, Himself should feel enthralment, shame and stripes. Let these to some fell trasicker in slaves Be sold, transported in remotest climes To witness Greek severity on vice; So by my voice should Xerxes be condemn'd; So shall the monster Demonax. The means I find, Themistocles, in thee. Elate To hear this great, authoritative dame, The chief replies: Thy mandate is my law, Thy equity is mine. Her stately brow Unbending, she concisely questions thus: How shall Eudora's favour mark thy worth? Thy blessing grant, he answers, well appris'd, That asking little best attains to all. I may do more, she said; thy ripen'd thoughts Impart hereafter; my extent of aid Diana must determine. Now farewell. He press'd no further, tow'rds Carystus turn'd His march, and reach'd her portals, while the sun Wanted three hours to finish his career. There was a temple to Briareus built, The son of Titan. In th' enormous shrine His image vast to thirty cubits rose In darkest marble. Terror, thick with curls O'erlaid the forehead, thick th' engraven beard The spacious chest o'ershadow'd; fifty shields, As many maces of refulgent brass The hundred hands upheld. Broad steps around The pedestal ascended, that before Th' outstretch'd Titanian feet religious fear Accumulated off'rings might dispose, So to propitiate the tremendous god. In single state before this image stood Nicomachus, the archon, to receive His son triumphant with Cecropia's chief. They now had pass'd th' expanded gates, and slow Approach'd the shrine in military pomp Along th' extensive isle. The walls and dome Replied to fifes and trumpets, to the clink Of manacles and setters, piercing sound, Which told the wearer's guilt. Till now unmark'd, A figure, grim and ghastly, from the crowd Darts, and a poniard plunging in the breast Of old Nicomachus, himself ascends The pedestal, and lifting his red steel On high, between the god's gigantic feet Intrepid takes his station. Terror dims Each gazing eye; th' illusive medium swells His size; in fancy'd magnitude he tow'rs Another son of Titan. As he stands Intent to speak, Themistocles, alone Of all th' assembly master of himself, Cool gives a sign, when thus th' assassin speaks, In phrase barbaric, and a soften'd look: I am that Oxus, whom suspicion marks A traitor to Cleora. Mistress dear, (At this a torrent gushes from his eyes) Thou knew'st me faithful. Listen, gracious lord, Thou tend'rest consort of the tend'rest wife, O Hyacinthus! listen to my tale, Thou too wilt own me faithful: On the night, Thy first of absence from Cleora's bed, No more thy love to bless, assassins forc'd Kind GlaucÃ¨'s dwelling; me they bound; my voice They barr'd; the priestess and her blameless maids They strangled. Mounted on a rapid steed One bore Cleora; two, robust and fell, Were my unresting guards. Through trackless woods Not far we journey'd; Demonax was near, Just march'd to waste Eretria's neighb'ring land. Conducting me to loneliest shades, my guides Remain'd a while conferring. One, I knew, Was Dacus, Dacus whom thy sire preferr'd In trust to all his menials. Words like these He utter'd: âThus Nicomachus enjoin'd; âTransporting Oxus to obscurest wilds, âDestroy, conceal him there. Access by night âTo Demonax obtain; by earnest suit âFrom him exact a promise to declare, âThat Oxus brought his daughter, then set free âWas sent rewarded to his Sacian home. âReceive the gold proclaim'd; depart. Be sure âNo other name, than Oxus, pass your lips.â This said, they gor'd me with repeated wounds; I sunk before them; they believ'd me dead. Deep in a pit, o'ergrown with brambles thick, They left me. Woodmen, haply passing, heard My piercing groans; in pity to a hut They bore me; herbs medicinal, and time, Restor'd my strength. His garment he unfolds, The crimson horrors of his num'rous scars To shew. Carystians, I my vital breath Among the Saces on the Caspian drew. A Genius dwells, a native in the lake, Who, in his function rising from the deep, Reveals foul murder. Purple are his wings, His hue is jet, a diamond his eye, His hair is inextinguishable flame. Whatever man, his visitation warns, Neglects to right the dead, he haunts, he drives To horrid frenzy. On a whirlwind borne, To me in momentary flight he came, In terrors clad uncommon; o'er my couch His clatt'ring pinions shook. His mandate high I have obey'd, the foulest murd'rer slain. Now, mistress dear, sole object of my zeal, Where'er thou art, if fleeting on some cloud A bright aerial spirit; if below Among the Genii of the earth, or seas, Dost trace the caves, where shine carbuncles pure, Or pluck the coral in cerulean grots, Thy faithful slave shall follow, still perform With his accustom'd vigilance thy will. This said, he struck the poniard through his breast, The blows repeating till he pierc'd the heart, Then on the crimson'd pedestal reclin'd His dying limbs, nor groan'd. What thoughts were thine, Nicomachus! To thee are open'd wide Death's portals; cold thy blood begins to flow. An injur'd son beside thee strives to doubt That he, who gave him being, now descends To sure damnation for so black a crime; But thou remov'st all doubt. Thy sister's ghost Before thee seems to glide, and point thy way To Erebus; Briareus' hundred hands To brandish serpents, lashing from his fane A sordid, grovelling parricide to hell. At length, amid confession of thy guilt, The furies snatch thee from the light of heav'n To that eternal gloom. The fainting limbs Of Hyacinthus forth Nicanor bears. Religious dread beholds the shrine impure With homicide; nor knows, what man, what god Must be consulted, or what rite perform'd To purge from deeds thus ominous the fane; Till recollection prompts a sudden hope, That wise, and great, and favour'd from above, Themistocles may succourâHe is gone. In double consternation all disperse. Night drops her curtain on the sleepless town. End of the Thirteenth Book. BOOK the Fourteenth. Bright morning sheds no gladness on the face Of pale Carystus, who, in visions fram'd By superstitious fear, all night had seen Briareus lift his hundred hands to crush His fane polluted, from the base to rend Each pillar'd mass, and hurl the fragments huge Against her tow'rs. Anon is terror chang'd To wonder, which consoles her. Through her gates, Amid the lustre of meridian day, In slow procession, solemnly advance A hundred youths in spotless tunics white, Sustaining argent wands. A vig'rous band Of sacerdotal servitors succeed, Who draw by turns the silver-graven shape Of Dian lofty on a wheeling stage Of artificial verdure. Virgins tall A guard surround her, each in flowing snow Of raiment, gather'd in a rosy knot Above one knee. They tread in sandals white, O'erlac'd by roseate bands; behind their necks Of lilly's hue depend their quivers full; Hands, which can string their tough and pond'rous bows, Eyes, darting beams severe, discover strength Unbroke by wedlock, hearts by love untam'd; Soft light the silver crescents on their heads Diffuse. Eudora follows in her car; Across her shoulders hangs a quiver large; Full-fac'd, a crystal moon illumes her hair. Penthesilea's Amazonian arm Had scarce the nerves to bend Eudora's bow. Her port, her aspect, fascinate the sight; Before her, passing, tow'rs and temples seem To sink below her level; she becomes The single object eminent; her neck, Her arms, the vestment shuts from view prophane; Low as her feet descends the sacred stole. Eight purple-harness'd steeds of milky hue, Her axle draw. Before her footstool sits The vanquisher of Xerxes; to the reins Of argent lustre his obsequious hand Themistocles applies. A hundred guards In burnish'd steel, and plumes like ridges new Of winter's fleeces, not unmartial rank'd Behind her wheels; the city's widest space They reach. To all the people, swarming round, In awful state the priestess thus began: Impiety and parricide, which spilt In Juno's sight her servant GlaucÃ¨'s blood, Your god, by double homicide profan'd, May well dismay Carystus. Lo! I come, Afflicted city, in thy day of woe Both to propitiate and conciliate heav'n. Learn first, no off'ring of a hundred bulls, Not clouds of incense, nor exhausted stores Of richest wine can moderate his wrath, Which visits children for the sire's offence, And desolates whole nations for the crimes Of kings and chiefs; unless by double zeal, By violence of virtue man disarm The jealous thunderer. Happy is your lot; The capital offender still survives; On him inflicted vengeance by your hands, Men of Carystus, will from Jove regain, And multiply his blessings on yourselves, Your sons and daughters. Swear then, old and young, Swear all before the fresh-polluted shrine; Ere you remove the carnage from that fane, Unite your valour by a gen'ral oath, That you will strengthen this Athenian's arm, Whom I from Dian, in the awful name Of all the gods and goddesses, adjure To quell the monster Demonax, by heav'n, By earth detested, parricide and scourge Tyrannic o'er EubÅa. At these words She fix'd an arrow in her mighty bow; Then rising, said; against an impious head Incens'd Diana thus her war declares. A cloud, low-hanging, instant by the force Of springing wind a boreal course began Tow'rds Oreus; thither bent Eudora's eye. Swift from her sounding string through folds obscure Of that thick vapour, as it fleets away, The arrow imperceptibly descends To earth. Fortuitous a sulph'rous spark Flash'd from the cloud. A prodigy! exclaim'd Themistocles; the holy shaft is chang'd To Jove's own bolt, and points the forked flame On Demonax. Swear, swear, the people shout; A gen'ral exhortation rends the cope Ethereal. Prompted by the subtil voice Of her prevailing counsellor, again Eudora solemn: You for once, my friends, Must supersede the strictness of your laws. Though Hyacinthus has not reach'd the date, Prescrib'd to those who wield the rule supreme, Elect him archon. Gallant, injur'd youth, Sage, pious, him Diana best approves, Him her unerring counsels will inspire. Me too, her priestess, in your need she lends; I will promulge the sacred oath to all; I from pollution will your town redeem. Unanimous consent is heard. Her car She leaves. Before Briareus, in her words, Sons, fathers, youth and age, enlist their spears. Meantime th' Athenian to Nicanor's home Resorts. He passes to the chamber sad, Whence Hyacinthus utters these complaints: Dost thou, Nicanor, parallel with mine The Ådipean horrors, or the pangs Felt by the race of Pelops, and deserv'd? Thus wouldst thou waken patience in a breast, Which feels affliction, far surpassing theirs, Feels undeserv'd affliction? Whom, O Jove! By error, lust, or malice have I wrong'd? Cut short my bloomâtorment me here no more. Let Rhadamanthus instantly decide, If with Cleora I must taste of bliss, Or with a father drink eternal woe. Here for a murder'd wife my eyes to stream Shall never cease; andâexecrable sire! Not grief, but all which furies can excite, Rage, detestation, horror I must feel For thee, my origin of lifeâwhat life! Yet, O thou spirit damn'd, the wretch thy son, The wretch, a father's cruelty hath made, Perhaps might spare a tearâbut GlaucÃ¨'s ghost, Thy righteous, hallow'd sister's ghost, forbids One drop of pity on thy pains to fallâ She skrieks aloud, curse, curse thy father's dust. Themistocles now enter'd. At his look, Which carry'd strange ascendancy, a spell Controlling nature, was the youth abash'd; As if his just sensations were a shame, Or his complaints to reach that hero's ear Were criminal. He falt'ring spake: Thou god Of Hyacinthus! passion thou dost awe; Thy presence humbles frenzy and despair. No, thy own manly fortitude alone Shall chase despair and frenzy from thy breast, Serene Themistocles reply'd: Arise, Thou new-created archon; private cares To interfere with public, neither men Nor gods allow, nor justice, nor the sense Of thy own wrongs. Young friend, the noble toil Of mind and body in this righteous cause Will give thee rank with heroes. Thou assist, Nicanor; share the glory. By the hand He led the passive youth. The people met Their young, their honour'd magistrate in joy; Eudora bless'd them; then in solemn zeal The purifying rites perform'd, and left Reviv'd Carystus. To her holy seat, While on the way her goddess radiant shone, Themistocles attended; then by dawn Back to Eretria swiftly press'd his march. Not Ãolus, the king of winds, could still Their gust, nor Neptune smooth his troubled waves, Nor Jove the raging thunderbolt compose More, than divine Themistocles had tam'd Oppression, terror, anguish and despair. This had GerÃ¦stus in her evil day, The panic-aw'd Carystians this had prov'd, Not less than sad Eretria. Her he finds Rejoicing, like some widow late forlorn, Who in the house of mourning with a train Of pining orphans destitute had sat; But by a hand beneficent uprais'd, Ungirds the humble sackcloth from her loins, Nor longer sprinkles ashes on her head, Amid reviving plenty. Such the change Among the Eretrians, through the copious aid Sicinus lent, within Chalcidic walls Still sedulous abiding. Ev'ry face The gladd'ning touch of rosy-tinctur'd health Illumines. Now from ruins clear'd, the streets By stable feet of passengers are trod; Th' impending season's turbulence to foil, Works, under Cleon's and Tisander's eye Begun, the vig'rous populace, inspir'd By their protector's presence, now pursue With industry to match the beaver breed Laborious and sagacious, who construct By native art their mansions, to repel Congealing air, and hoary drifts of snow In winter's harsh domains. From day to day The toil continued. Early on a morn A stranger came, in body all deform'd, In look oblique, but keen; an eastern garb Enwrapp'd his limbs distorted; from his tongue Fell barb'rous accents. He address'd the chief In Grecian phrase, which falter'd on his tongue: I am a Tyrian trafficker in slaves; Returning home from Libya, have been forc'd By dang'rous winds to this EubÅan coast For shelter. Watching for a friendly gale, I learn'd from fame, that, warrior, thou dost wield A sword which prospers, and its captives dooms To servitude. Themistocles commands The sev'n GerÃ¦stian tyrants from his ship, Where at the bottom they had gnash'd their teeth In chains unslacken'd. To the merchant then: Without a price these miscreants from our climes Remove, the farthest hence will best repay The obligation. For a master chuse The most ferocious savage on the wilds Of horrid Scythia, or the Caspian bound. Secure conductors he appoints, a band To chain them fast aboard. Each irksome step They count in curses. O'er EubÅa lost, Not as their native region, but the seat Of pow'r and crimes triumphantly enjoy'd, They weep, still criminal in tears. But soon, When from the harbour distance had obscur'd The well-row'd bark, the fetters from their limbs The merchant orders, who, another tone, Another mien assuming, thus began: GerÃ¦stian lords, redemption you derive From Demonax of Oreus. Me the first Among his council, Lamachus by name, He sent to practice on the wily chief Of Athens, wiles which undermine his own. They land at Dium, thence to Oreus march; Where Demonax admits them, as he sat In secret council: âYour disasters known âObtain'd our instant succour. What intends âThemistocles?â This answer is return'd. Not less, great prince, Themistocles intends Than thy destruction. Of Eretrian blood All who survive, GerÃ¦stus, Styra join Against thy throne. Carystus from her walls Will pour battalions, by Eudora fir'd. The Amarynthian priestess hath declar'd War in Diana's name. The lab'ring hind Will quit the furrow; shepherds from their flocks, Youths from their sport, the keeper from his herd Will run to arms at her commanding voice, So prevalent the sound. The tyrant turns To Mindarus the Persian: Let us march Swift to destroy the serpent in his egg. To him the Persian: Demonax forgets, That winter's rigour chills the soldier's blood. Dost thou not hear the tempest, while it howls Around us? Ev'n Mardonius active, bold, Now rests in covert of Thessalian roofs, Nor fights with nature. Shall my gen'ral hear That I conduct the race of hottest climes In freezing rain and whirlwinds to assail A strong-wall'd town, protected by a chief For valour, skill, and stratagem renown'd, With all th' unsparing elements his guard? Again the tyrant: Mindarus, confine Thy Asiatics, till the roses bud; While I, in howling storms, in damps, or frost Will head my own EubÅans. Heav'n forbid! The wary Lamachus subjoins: My lord, Repose no trust without thy foreign bands In these new subjects. Gods! th' alluring guile Of that Athenian would dissolve thy ranks, To his own hostile banner would seduce Half thy battalions. Demonax again: Then policy with policy shall war. Among th' Eretrians publish, from their hands This virulent Athenian I require Bound and deliver'd to my will; their wives, Their children else, late captives of my sword, Shall from their state of servitude be dragg'd To bleed th' immediate victims of my wrath. Then Mindarus: Should great Mardonius hear, That I such inhumanity permit, He would exert his full monarchal pow'r, My guilty limbs condemning to a cross. In fury foaming, Demonax exclaims: I am betray'd. Thee, Mindarus, the son Of that stern prince, who laid Eretria waste, Thee Xerxes, future sov'reign of the world, Appointed my supporter; in this isle That I, a branch from his imperial root, Might grow a splendid vassal of his throne. My cause, his service, now thy heart disowns, Perverse thy sword abandons. Of my friends Thou best requited, most ingrate! Preferr'd Once to have been my son, of treasures vast The destin'd heir, my successor in sway, Dost thou desert me, and protect my foes? But to Mardonius, to the mighty king, I will accuse thee. By th' infernal pow'rs Themistocles hath gain'd thee; or thou fear'st To face that captain on the field of war. His breast the Persian striking, thus in tears: Dost thou recall thy parricide to wound My inmost bosom? though another held My dear Cleora by the holiest ties, I would have struggled with despairing love; But sink o'erwhelm'd by horror of that deed, Which, blasting such perfection, calls on heav'n For punishment unbounded. If thou fall'st, It is the hand of Horomazes weighs To earth a body overcharg'd with guilt. Dost thou upbraid me, undeserving man, Forgetting recent service? Who restor'd Thy scepter lost? what captain hath reduc'd Orobia, Dium, half EubÅa's towns, But Mindarus? He these atchievements past Regrets, but while appointed by his prince Will urge his duty to accomplish new. Then come the season for a warrior's toil, Themistocles shall see my banner guide Twelve thousand spears; shall see my early sword To gen'ral battle, or to single fight, Defy th' experience of his pow'rful arm. He said, and left the council. All withdrew But Lamachus. The tiger, when escap'd, Or fell hyÃ¦na from an eager chace Of dogs and hunters, feels not more dismay, Mix'd with a thirst insatiate of revenge, Than shook the monster Demonax, who thus. To Lamachus: Insulted and controul'd By an audacious stranger, do I rule In Oreus longer? By a poison'd draught, Or midnight poniard Mindarus shall die. Ariobarzanes, second in command, Will serve me best. The counsellor subjoins: If secret poison, or a midnight blow Would remedy the grievance, I would try Their instant operation; but reflect, Twelve thousand warriors, masters of thy fate, Who love their gen'ral living, on his death Might prove too harsh inquisitors. At least His courage use once more on open foes; A valiant leader makes the soldier brave; So have we found in Mindarus. Reserve Assassination for a greater mark, Themistocles. The tyrant quick: Proclaim Five golden talents on his head the price. Discreet, though wicked, Lamachus again: Wouldst thou incense all Greece, whose navy rules The main? Howe'er triumphant in the field, No timely help Mardonius could extend. The genius of Themistocles, the nymph Of Salamis indignant by his side, Would range from state to state. Their loud alarm Would send the whole confederated fleet Before the earliest breezes of the spring To pour vindictive myriads on our coast. Then what our doom? No, Demonax, my lord, These sev'n GerÃ¦stians, while thy recent grace Transports their minds, and blows the embers hot Of rage at recent insult, let us league Against this formidable man by oaths Before the furies in their neighb'ring cave. Thyself be present. Yes, the monster said, I will be present, though Cleora's ghost Be there, and that vile produce, which disgrac'd Her virgin zone! Remembrance of his guilt, He rous'd to strengthen fury and revenge. There was a cavern in the bowels deep Of naked rock by Oreus, where the stern Eumenides possess'd a dusky shrine, And frown'd in direful idols from the time That Titan's offspring o'er EubÅa reign'd The enemies of Jove. Around it slept A stagnant water, overarch'd by yews, Growth immemorial, which forbade the winds E'er to disturb the melancholy pool. To this, the fabled residence abhorr'd Of hell-sprung beings, Demonax, himself Predominating dÃ¦mon of the place, Conducts the sev'n assassins. There no priest Officiates; single there, as Charon grim, A boatman wafts them to the cavern's mouth. They enter, fenc'd in armour; down the black Descent, o'er moist and lubricated stone, They tread unstable. Night's impurest birds With noisome wings each loathing visage beat; Of each the shudd'ring flesh through plated steel By slimy efts, and clinging snakes is chill'd; Cold, creeping toads beset th' infected way. Now at the cave's extremity obscene They reach the sisters three, tremendous forms, Of huge, mishapen size. Alecto there, TisiphonÃ©, MegÃ¦ra, on their fronts Display their scorpion curls; within their grasp Their serpents writh'd. Before them sulph'rous fires In vases broad, antiquity's rude toil, To render horror visible, diffus'd Such light, as hell affords. Beside a chasm, Whose bottom blind credulity confin'd By Tartarus alone, with trembling feet Stood Lamachus, the wicked and deform'd. An ewe, in dye like ebony, he gor'd; The dark abyss receiv'd a purple stream. Next to the dire conspirators he held A vessel; o'er the brim their naked arms They stretch'd; he pierc'd the veins; th' envenom'd blood, A fit libation mix'd for hell, he pour'd Down the deep cleft; then falt'ring, half dismay'd At his own rites, began: Ye injur'd men, Of wealth and honours violently spoil'd, Implacably condemn'd to bonds and rods By insolent Themistocles, before These dreadful goddesses you swear; his death You vow, by every means revenge can prompt, In secret ambush, or in open fight, By day, by night, with poison, sword, or fire; Else on your heads you imprecate the wrath Of these inexorable pow'rs. They swore. Meantime the object of their impious oaths, Whate'er his future destiny, enjoy'd The comforts which Eretria now partook Through him, so justly her preserver styl'd; While thus reflection whisper'd to his heart: This Aristides would delight to see, For this commend his rival. Though my soul Knows that in quest of glory for this port I spread th' advent'rous sail, yet sweeter far She feels that glory, since a gallant race, Snatch'd from the gripe of misery and death By her exalted faculties, become Her means of pow'r and greatness. I confess, An act like this my rival would achieve, Nor other motive seek, than acting well. Perhaps with more attention to myself, More sudden, more complete is my success. Lo! in his view Sicinus, just arriv'd From Chalcis. Him his joyful lord thus hail'd: We have been long asunder; welcome thrice, Thou long expected; on thy brow I see Intelligence. To whom the faithful man: One moon I spent in Chalcis; I address'd Nearchus first, of Chares, slain in fight At Artemisium, successor approv'd To lead his country's banners. He rejoic'd In thy arrival; not so frank in joy Timoxenus the archon. On the day Of my return that hesitating chief, While invitation to his roof he gave, Was dreading thy acceptance. But supreme O'er him, and all his house, a daughter sways, In beauty's full meridian left to mourn The loss of Chares on her widow'd bed. Not thy Timothea, not Cleander's spouse TrÃ¦zene's wonder, not Sandauce young, Not Medon's sister of th' OetÃ¦an hill, Though beauteous like the goddesses she serves, Exceed AcanthÃ¨; she may almost vye With Amarantha's celebrated form, The pride of Delphian Timon! To behold The conqueror of Xerxes is her wish. The hero thought a moment; soon resolv'd, He spake: The car, the mantle, Sparta's gifts, The gems from Ariabignes won that day, When at my feet his proud tiara bow'd, Provide by dawn. Retire we now to rest. End of the Fourteenth Book. BOOK the Fifteenth. Now dimm'd by vapours, frequent in his track, The twelfth division of his annual round The sun is ent'ring. Long hath vernal bloom, Hath summer's prime from thy descriptive lays, O Muse! withdrawn; and now the aged year Its last remains of beauty hath resign'd; Transparent azure of autumnal skies Is chang'd to mist, the air serene to storms. But inspiration from th' imagin'd balm Of spring, or summer's warmth, enrich'd by sweets From flow'ry beds, and myrtles' fragrant bow'rs, Thou dost not want; then bid thy numbers roll In cadence deep to imitate the voice Of boist'rous winter in his mantle hoar. All night by rude Hippotades the air Tormented round the foaming harbour wheel'd; Each mast was pliant to the raging gust, The mooring cable groan'd. Long slept the son Of Neocles, unvisited by care, Till, as the hours attendant on the morn Had just unclos'd the orient gate of day, He starts. AcanthÃ¨, who controuls her sire, His active fancy pictures on his mind Thus pond'ring: Dear Timothea, yet less dear Than pow'r and fame acquir'd by saving Greece, Without Chalcidic aid thy husband's hope Is meer abortion. Chalcis must be gain'd Best, Aristides, by the purest means, But well by any. Swift his inner garb Of softest wool thick-woven he assumes, Of finer texture then a scarlet vest; O'er these, in dye of violet's deep hue, His Spartan mantle negligently waves. A golden tissue with a crimson plume, To fence his manly temples and adorn, He wears. His car is ready; ready wait Th' Eretrian people, his conducting guard To Chalcis not remote. The sounding way Is hard and hoar; crystalline dew congeal'd Hath tipt the spiry grass; the waters, bound In sluggish ice, transparency have lost; No flock is bleating on the rigid lawn, No rural pipe attunes th' inclement air; No youths and damsels trip the choral round Beneath bare oaks, whose frost-incrusted boughs Drop chilling shadows; icicles invest The banks of rills, which, grating harsh in strife With winter's fetters, to their dreary sides No passenger invite. The cautious chief In sight of Chalcis to their homes dismiss'd The whole Eretrian number, but retain'd His hundred Attic and Laconian friends: He pass'd the gate before expiring day. Sicinus, staid forerunner, not unknown By residence in Chalcis, publish'd loud His lord's approach. The citizens in throngs Salute the celebrated man. His gates Timoxenus the archon throws abroad, And, true to hospitality, prepares For his distinguish'd, though unwelcome guest, Her lib'ral rites. Themistocles he leads To share a banquet in a sumptuous hall, Where stands divine AcanthÃ¨. Is there wife, Or maid, or widow'd matron, now in Greece, Who would not all her ornaments assume To welcome this known saviour of the Greeks Where'er he passes? As the queen of heav'n In dazzling dress to match her goddess form, Grac'd by the zone of Cytherea, met Th' Olympian king on Ida; brilliant thus AcanthÃ¨ greets Themistocles. Mature In manhood he, nor bord'ring on decline, The ornamental cov'ring from his head Lifts in obeisance; careless curls releas'd, Thick overshadowing his forehead high, Present a rival to the Phidian front Of Jupiter at Pisa. With a look, Which summon'd all his talents, all his mind To view, he blends a sweetness, nature's gift, But heighten'd now by energy of wiles, Alluring wiles, to melt the proudest fair. In his approach he moves the genuine sire Of all the Graces on AcanthÃ¨'s hand To print his lips. Invited by that hand, Close to her lovely side of her alone He sits observant, while the rich repast Continu'd. Soon his vigilance perceiv'd, That her unsated ear devour'd his words, That from her lip an equal spell enthrall'd Her doating father, who adoring view'd Minerva in AcanthÃ¨. Now withdrawn Was all attendance, when the daughter thus: O first of men, sole grace of each abode Where thou art present, fortunate are those Who saw thy actions, fortunate who hear The bare narration; happier still those ears, Which from thy mouth can treasure in the mind A full impression of the glorious tale! Forgive a woman, whom thy manners tempt To sueâif yet thy gentleness should deem Too curious, too importunate her suit, Thy host Timoxenus at least indulge, That o'er his festive hall th' achievements high, Which Salamis and Artemisium saw, Though now but whisper'd from thy gracious lips, May sound hereafter loud. The wily chief, Ne'er disinclin'd to celebrate his deeds, Now to this lovely auditress, whose aid His further fame requir'd, a tale began, Where elegance of thought, and paint of words, Embellish'd truth beyond her native guise, In various lengthen'd texture of discourse, A web of pleasing wonders to ensnare The hearer's heart. Till midnight he pursues A strain like magic to the list'ning fair; Nor yet his thread to Salamis had reach'd, Extended fine for many sweet repasts To her inflam'd desire of hearing more. Timoxenus at length to due repose Imparts the signal; they disperse. Her guest Delights AcanthÃ¨'s pillow; but her sire In care lies anxious, lest the season rude Detain that guest, and fatal umbrage give To Demonax terrific. Morn and eve Return. AcanthÃ¨ drinks the pleasing stream Of eloquence exhaustless in its flow, Whose draughts repeated but augment her thirst. Now in description's animating gloss The various scenes at Salamis exalt The fair one's mind. The Attic wives and maids She emulates in wish, and sees in thought Their beauteous ranks inspiring youth and age To battle; now the tumult rude of Mars, The crashing oars, the bloody-streaming decks Chill her soft bosom; now that snowy seat Of gen'rous pity heaves; her azure eyes Melt o'er Sandauce, in her years of bloom Disconsolately widow'd, and transpiere'd By death-like horror at her children doom'd To savage Bacchus. Here the artful man Dwells on his own humanity, but hides The stratagem, which policy, not dimm'd By his compassion, on compassion built, When to her freedom he restor'd the fair, Who blameless help'd his artifice to drive From Greece her royal brother. To the worth Of Artamanes tribute just he pays. His own reception by the Spartan state He colours high, the public chariot giv'n, The purple mantle, and the coursers proud, Deriv'd from those, who won th' Olympian wreath For Demaratus; but omits to speak, How, while seducing vanity misled His steps so far from Athens, she conferr'd The naval guidance on Xanthippus brave, And rule supreme on Aristides just. Th' ensnaring story, to this period drawn, While sev'n nocturnal rounds the planets ran, Possesses all AcanthÃ¨, but disturbs Her timid father, trembling at the pow'r Of Demonax; yet fondness oft would smile On her delight. The evening which succeeds Themistocles, in fiction mix'd with truth, Not to AcanthÃ¨, but his host, began: Accompany'd from Sparta by the flow'r Of her illustrious citizens I gain'd Her borders, there indignant was appris'd, That Demonax, whom heretofore I chac'd From Oreus, now by Persian arms restor'd, Was trampling on EubÅa. Vengeance fir'd My spirit; fifty of the Spartan troop At once became associates of my zeal, With fifty nobles more of Attic blood. My full stor'd vessels at Eretria's port From Sunium's cape arriv'd. He now unfolds The wond'rous series of his recent deeds. What divers passions, sweet AcanthÃ¨, rise In thy attentive, gen'rous mind? What sighs Do Hyacinthus and Cleora wake, What horror black Nicomachus, what joy Reviv'd Eretria, and GerÃ¦stus freed, What admiration great Eudora's state, What rev'rence good Tisander's sacred locks, What detestation Demonax accurs'd? Behold me here, Themistocles concludes, Who lift in Athens' and Laconia's name, A guardian shield o'er Chalcis. But thy sword, Offensive drawn, shall utterly confound The homicide thy neighbour. Ah! replies Timoxenus, alarm'd, thou little know'st The might of Oreus. Demonax can range Twelve thousand warriors cull'd from Asia's host, Of train'd EubÅan youth and light-arm'd slaves A multitude innum'rous on the plain. His own exactions, and the Persian's boons, O'erload his treasure. When the annual sun In his new course three monthly terms hath fill'd, Expect Mardonius from Thessalia's bounds On Greece to pour invasion. Ah! what help, Should we exchange tranquillity for war, From her own wants could Attica supply, What LacedÃ¦mon?âCool th' Athenian here: Weigh well the grace your Polyphemus dy'd In carnage grants, reserving for his last, Most precious morsel, your Chalcidian wealth. Shall this rich mansion, casket to a gem Which none can value (earnest here he caught AcanthÃ¨'s earnest look) shall this abode Feel pillage, insult, which my shudd'ring mind Scarce dares to think, from that despoiler's hand, Who, scourging half EubÅa, in this hour Dreads thee, great archon? Murderer, who cut His own Cleora's thread in early bloom, He trembles now, Timoxenus, at thee, O bless'd of parents, blessing such a child As thy AcanthÃ¨; he thy vengeance dreads, O paragon of fathers, dreads thy sword Unsheath'd with mine. Presumption I disclaim, Or want of def'rence to the wise like thee. Accept this roll; contemplate there the force Of Amarynthus, of Carystus large, GerÃ¦stus and Eretria; add the spears Of Delphian Timon, of that hero fam'd, OÃ¯lean Medon, who my signal watch From AtalantÃ¨'s isle. Remote the time For action; then deliberate. I wait Without impatience thy resolves mature. Retir'd, AcanthÃ¨, whose enlighten'd mind Was bless'd with native talents, as her form With beauty, strives a while in reason's scale To weigh th' importance of this high attempt Propos'd; when something whispers, canst thou doubt Themistocles a moment? Can his sword Do less, than conquer? Where the pow'rful arm, The valour, where the policy to vie With him, whose faculties no man can reach, No god raise higher? These conceptions prove A guide to fancy half the sleepless night Through all th' enchanting scenery of thought, Which recollection of his brilliant deeds, His courage, might, humanity, and grace, His gentle manners, and majestic frame, Exhibits lovely, dazzling and sublime To melt her softness, and her wisdom blind. Envelop'd now by slumber, in a dream, Which overleaps all measur'd time and space, She sees the laurell'd hero, as return'd From subjugated Oreus. On his spear The gory head of Demonax he bears. Her yet untainted purity of heart, Which in sincerity of grief had mourn'd Cleora's fate, applauds the just award By Nemesis and Themis on the guilt Of parricide. Her nobleness of soul Enjoys the blessings which EubÅa reaps From such a conquest; but no vision kind Would interpose a warning to allay Excess of transport at the conqu'ror's sight. From fair AcanthÃ¨'s own retreat at night A well-embellish'd gallery's long range Bounds on the splendid chamber, which admits Themistocles to rest. AcanthÃ¨ here, When magisterial duties from his home Her father call'd, had entertain'd the guest By morn, and feasted all and every morn On rich profusion of his Attic words. The sun was ris'n, and summon'd from her couch To this accustom'd interview the fair. Not meeting straight the object of her search, As each preceding morn, she feels a pain, That he is absent. With a voice though low His chamber sounds; to listen she disdains, Back to her own by delicacy led. In cautious tones Sicinus with his lord Was thus discoursing: In my wonted walk, To watch events since thy arrival here, I met Nearchus. Haste, he said, apprise Themistocles that long ere op'ning day His potent friends Timoxenus conven'd, Heads of his faction. They refuse to arm. Some, I suspect, are tainted by the gold Of Demonax; the major part in all Obey the timid archon. I have strength, Which, when Themistocles commands, shall try To force compliance from the coward's breast; But would AcanthÃ¨, noble dame, espouse The glorious cause, her prevalence could guide His doating fondness, and controul his fears. Enough, replies Themistocles. Again The learned tutor, fervent and sincere: If thy persuasive eloquence could win Her noble spirit to direct her sire, It would be well. But, O resistless man, Let thy persuasion moderate its charm; Let not a gen'rous lady's peace of mind Become the victim of her winning guest; The laws of hospitality revere. Remember too the hymeneal vow, Remember thy Timothea, fair and kind, Who bore those children, pupils of my care; She now in Athens at thy absence pines. Misjudging friend, Timothea never pines, When I am urging my career of fame, Returns the chief. EubÅans must be freed. She shall know all, and knowing will commend. Go, charge Nearchus to suppress all thought Of violence; his valour shall have scope, Dy'd in Barbarian, not in civil blood. Thus he, well-caution'd that in Chalcis pow'r Aristocratic, both in wealth and strength, Out-weigh'd the people. Then a splendid gem, Of all his spoils the richest, he selects, And from his chamber o'er the sounding plank, Which floors the echoing gallery, proceeds. Behold AcanthÃ¨; not the orient sky Forth from its amber gates in summer's prime The goddess-widow of Tithonus sends More fragrant, nor in blushes more to charm. A new emotion heaves her gentle breast Of swelling snow. Th' Athenian distant, mute Remains. To speak, her hesitating lips Awhile, though prompted by her heart, delay; When, shap'd by chance, this elegant request Flows from her unpremeditated thoughts: So much oblig'd already, courteous guest, By thy narration, I have cause to blush While I solicit a recital new Of one exploit, distinguish'd from the rest, When Ariabignes fell before thy sword In sight of Greece. Themistocles requir'd No repetition of the flatt'ring suit, But in transcendent energy of style, Impress'd the bright achievement on her mind More deep, than ev'n by novelty before. Thus he concluded: Doubly now I bless Th' auspicious hour when my successful hand Despoil'd the bravest chief in Asia's host Of this, my humble off'ring to adorn The fairest head in Greece. He said, the gem Presenting graceful, which she turn'd aside, Rejecting not the giver, but the gift; And answer'd thus: To heaps of richest gems, To all the tribute pour'd at Persia's throne, Thy words alone, thy converse I prefer. Her look perusing earnest, he proceeds: Dost thou refuse a token of regard From one, thy hospitable hand hath bless'd Beyond th' expression of his grateful tongue? When, at this hour departing, he again Perhaps may ne'er behold theeâAh! depart! She in unguarded consternation sighs. Th' Athenian here in seeming sadness thus: Alas! thy father, I too surely know, Will never join my arms; can I remain Till this fair city, populous and rich, This mansion, thy inestimable worth Become the prey of DemonaxâThis heav'n Will ne'er permit, she eagerly replies; Thou wilt protect meâGuardian to distress, Thou wilt not hurry to desert a friend, Whose hospitable kindness thou hast prais'd. Fill, fill with pow'rful argument the mouth Of me thy suppliant for another week; My words Timoxenus regards ... The chief By interruption sooths her troubled mind: I came to save thee. If another week Thou wilt employ ... I will, I will, she said, Do thou but stay; my father I will bind To thee, whom victory can ne'er forsake. They part; his chamber he regains; not long He meditates. AcanthÃ¨ grants her aid Spontaneous. Now to elevate her soul By dignity of thought, and gen'rous hope Of glory, purchas'd by a noble deed, He thus contrives: On tablets fair and large, For her deportment tow'rds a doating sire, His ready style instruction copious draws, Clos'd in these words: âAmong the guardians heav'n âTo Greece hath destin'd, an exalted mind âEnrolls AcanthÃ¨; let her constant feet âPursue her leading genius; grateful flow'rs âBefore her steps shall freed EubÅa strew; âThe brightest laurels shall Minerva chuse âAmong the groves of Athens, to entwine âThe first of women with immortal wreaths; âThe Muses all shall triumph in their sex; âA double rapture Ãschylus shall feel, âWho, fam'd in martial action, as in song, âShall celebrate AcanthÃ¨.â To her hand This by discreet Sicinus is convey'd. Day after day the fair-one, as inspir'd, Now forcibly persuasive, now in tears Of importuning tenderness, assails A parent fond. She penetrates his heart; His resolution melts; at length his fears To her superior guidance yield the rein. Meantime, instructed by their chief, the train Of Spartans and Athenians, all dispers'd Around the hospitable town, prociaim, To list'ning ears, the well-advis'd design Against the tyrant Demonax. Not long AcanthÃ¨'s purpose is unknown, divulg'd By vigilant Sicinus; while each mind Among th' applauding populace is warm'd, Who venerate her name. Among the chiefs The archon's weighty approbation known, Hath banish'd doubt; in council they decide To march with great Themistocles. Light fame Mounts on her wings, and through EubÅa sounds The preparations ardent. Shields and spears, Swords, corselets, helms new furbish'd, banners old Produc'd, which gallant ancestry had wav'd, Youth now commences, ripen'd age renews The exercise of arms. Nearchus loud Extols Themistocles. Like glorious Mars From his first trophies on PhlegrÃ¦an sields Among encircling brethren of the sky, Who from his sword perpetual conquest hop'd, The Salaminian victor is rever'd In Chalcis. Daily, hourly he surveys The martial toil. AcanthÃ¨'s presence aids; His prudence leads her through these active scenes; He talks on military themes alone, And pictures freedom trampling on the necks Of tyrants and Barbarians. This at length Might have abated in a virtuous breast The flame, his guilty policy had rais'd; But fate and black conspiracy forbid. End of the Fifteenth Book. BOOK the Sixteenth. That month severe, unfolding to the sun A frosty portal, whence his steeds renew Their yearly round, was clos'd. O'ercome at night By toil uncommon, lay th' Athenian chief In early sleep profound, which early freed His eyes again. In suffocating fumes He wakes. Upstarting, round his limbs he wraps Th' external garment, and Sicinus cails, Who slept not distant. He unbars a door, Which shews the gallery in flames. Down sinks The crackling floor. A main sustaining beam From end to end, transverse another, stands Yet unconsum'd. Lo! trembling in his view AcanthÃ¨; inextinguishable flames Between them rage. A moment he devotes To eye the gulph, which menaces with death Him and his hopes, in him the Grecian weal. Would Aristides hesitate thus long To save the meanest? I before me see On life's last verge a creature half divine. Urg'd by that thought, along the burning beam He rushes swift. He catches in his arms The loose-rob'd fair-one, clinging round his neck. Returning, not like Orpheus, who regain'd EurydicÃ¨ and lost, with matchless strength He holds his prize above the pointed spires Of fiery volumes, which on either side Assail his passing steps. The son of Jove Not more undaunted through the livid blaze Of Piuto's mansion bore the victim pure Of conjugal affection back to life, Alcestis. Lo! Sicinus stops his feet In their mid course. Thy chamber flames, he cries; Speed o'er this traverse beam; yon open door Leads to a passage yet unscorch'd. He guides; The hero follows; danger here augments. As through a swelling tide he wades through fire, Which scath'd his brows, his blazing beard and hair, Nor spar'd the garments of his precious charge; Yet her unhurt through that befriending door His unrelax'd rapidity conveys. Of pain regardless to the public street He thence descends; no populace is here; That front vulcanian fury had not reach'd; The other draws the throng; confusion there Prevails, uproar and terror. On he speeds Through frozen air, and falling flakes of snow, Unwearied still his lovely burden holds, AcanthÃ¨ fainting; her uncover'd breast, Unless that ringlets of her locks unbound Let fall at times their loose and silky threads, Against his cheek with marble coldness press'd. At last the dwelling of Nearchus nigh Affords a refuge. On a friendly bed, But not of rest, Themistocles in pain Extends his limbs; AcanthÃ¨ female slaves Receive and cherish. Absent is their lord, Who, at the head of military files In haste collected, early, but in vain Had issued forth. The palace is consum'd. Timoxenus to shelter he conducts; The archon, trembling for his daughter's fate, Beholds her safe, and feels no other loss. Now all salute Themistocles; but first Sicinus spake: Infernal arts have laid Thy palace waste, Timoxenus. I saw Sulphureous, glutinous materials blaze Close to the chamber of my lord's repose. From lips nigh parch'd by torture of his pains Themistocles began: My earthly term If heav'n requir'd me now to close, enough I have atchiev'd to fill the trump of fame. To have preserv'd thy daughter, gen'rous host, Would crown my glory! Medon is not far; Well would that chief my vacant post supply, Were I remov'd. But, friends, my hurts are light, Which common succour of Machaon's art Will soon repair; yet publish you my state As dang'rous; words and looks observe; keen spies To Oreus send. Thus caution'd, each retir'd Except Sicinus, who address'd his lord: Wilt thou trust rumour in her flight at large To sound thy state as dang'rous? Shall a tale To cozen foes, and try thy new allies, Pass unrefuted to Cecropian shores, Rive thy Timothea's bosom, grieve thy friends, Dismay all Athens, and suspend that aid Which she might lend thee in some adverse hour? The hero then: O monitor expert! Thou hast foreftall'd me; instant will I spare Thee to prevent such fears. Thou canst not stem The vex'd Euripus. From GerÃ¦stus sail; To my Timothea fly. Thy looks enquire How to relate my story: Tell her all; I have been faithful to my nuptial vow, Yet have succeeded. Let th' Athenians know My force and destin'd enterprize; forbear Of them to crave assistance; let them act As humour sways. Cleander shouldst thou meet, In kindest greetings tell him, I should prize TrÅzenian succourâTo its healing solds I am solicited by sleepâFarewell. Not so AcanthÃ¨'s troubles are compos'd. When lenient balm of Morpheus steep'd the cares Of other bosoms, in the midnight damps She quits a thorny pillow. Half array'd, With naked feet she roams a spacious floor, Whence she contemplates that retreat of rest, Inclosing all her wishes, hapless fair, Without one hope; there stifling sighs, she melts In silent tears. The sullen groan of winds, Which shake the roof, the beating rain she hears Unmov'd, nor heeds stern winter, who benumbs Her tender beauties in his harsh embrace. O Love! to vernal sweets, to summer's air, To bow'rs, which temper sult'ry suns at noon, Art thou confin'd? To rills in lulling flow, To flow'rs, which scent thy arbours of recess, To birds, who sing of youth and soft desire? All is thy empire, ev'ry season thine, Thou universal origin of things, Sole ruler, oft a tyrant. Stealing steps Full frequent draw AcanthÃ¨ to the door Of her preserver. While he sleeps, and pain Excites no groan to wound her list'ning ear, Anxiety abates; but passion grows. Then recollecting his intrepid strides Through fiery surge, devouring, as he pass'd, His hair majestic, wreathing round his limbs In torment, which none else to save her life Would face, or could endure, unguarded thought In murm'ring transport issues from her lips. To boundless obligation can I shew Less, than unbounded gratitudeâBase tongue, Dar'st thou the name of gratitude profane, Which is a virtueâOh! thou impious flame Within my breast, not gratitude hath blown Thee from a spark to so intense a heat. Deprav'd AcanthÃ¨, vagabond impure Of night, from honour and its laws estrang'd, A robber's criminal desire of spoil Thou feel'st, a rage of sacrilege to force The sanctuary of Hymen, and that fire, Which law, religion, men and gods protect, Quench on his altar by the hand of vice. She could no more. A parting cloud reveal'd The moon. Before the silver light she dropp'd On her bare knee, enfeebled by the cold; There fix'd and freezing, from that awful pow'r Of chastity she seem'd invoking help; When, newly-waken'd by her piercing moan, With smarting limbs Themistocles had left His pillow; keener his internal pang, To see an image of despair, the work Of his fallacious art. On his approach, At once the worn remains of spirit fled From her cold bosom, heaving now no more. The twilight glimmers on the rear of night; His painful arms uplift her from the floor, And to her couch with decency of care Commit her lifeless charms. To sense restor'd, Just as the morn's exploring eye unclos'd, AcanthÃ¨, faint and speechless, by a sign Forbids his presence; cautious he retires. Now she indulg'd her agonies of shame And self-reproach. With horrid visions teem'd Her agitated brain; black-rob'd despair Stalk'd round her curtains, in his double grasp A bloody poniard, and empoison'd bowl To her sad choice upholding; but ere long That thirsty, parching malady, which boils The putrid blood, and ravages like fire, Invades her frame. Whole days, whole nights she saw A tender sire beside her pillow mourn, Her beauties wasting hourly in his view. To gentler forms delirium then would change; The moon, so lately to her aid invok'd, She saw, descending from her lucid sphere, Assume her shape of goddess, who inspir'd A soothing thought to seek for health and peace At her propitious oracle, not rob So kind a father of his only joy. Meantime the tidings vague of Chalcis burn'd, And great Themistocles destroy'd, had fame Proclaim'd aloud through each EubÅan town, Save where Sicinus, passing to his port Of embarkation, spreads a milder tale, Alarming still. Eretria scarce confines Tisander's falt'ring age; but Cleon thence, From Styra Lampon hastes; GerÃ¦stus sends Eudemus; Hyacinthus feels no more His own distress, and rapid, as the bird Of Jupiter through heav'n's aerial way, Flies to his guardian friend. Eudora, skill'd In healing juices, condescends to mount Herself the sacred axle, and her state Displays in Chalcis worshipping her wheels. The archon waits respectful on her steps, When she salutes th' Athenian, still recluse From public view, though nigh restor'd. He bends The knee before her. Him with stately grace She raises, then addresses: Glad I see Thy convalescence; to impart my help Became a duty. So Diana will'd, By me consulted in her solemn grove Mysterious; where an impulse warn'd my soul, That none, but thou, can set EubÅa free, Protect the temples, and her tyrant quell. He kiss'd her sacred vestment, and replied: I now perceive how pow'rful are thy pray'rs. To them, so favour'd by the gods, I owe My preservation, which, O learn'd and wise, Forestalls thy skill! Ah! since thy face hath deign'd To cheer this city, by a long abode Complete the blessing. As to ancient Troy Was that Palladian image sent from heav'n, Be thou to Chalcis. At thy presence known Pale Demonax will shrink. But first apply Thy lenient succour to my friend's distress, Whose daughter pines in sickness, and deserves Thy full regard, most holy and benign. To sad AcanthÃ¨'s couch the archon leads Eudora. Soon from Oreus tidings stern Awake the native terrors in his heart; In haste he greets Themistocles: O guest! Fierce Demonax assembles all his force, But first will try an embassy; expect Within three days the tyrant's fell demands, Which, not accepted, bring th' avenging waste Of his redoubled fury on our heads. Is he so poor in counsellors, began Th' Athenian calm? Amid disabling storms In this rough season will th' insensate brute Drag to the field his Asiatic host? He thinks me dead; remember thou, my friend, Themistocles is living, nor conceive The rash, disturb'd and self-tormenting breast Of such a tyrant, whom the furies haunt, Hath fortitude and conduct to withstand Themistocles in arms. Not half-reviv'd Subjoins the archon: Thou alas! may'st want The brave auxiliars promis'd to thy arms; To thee alike unfriendly are the storms Which lock our harbours; not a bark can sail; Illustrious Medon dares not plough the surge From AtalantÃ¨; nor on Artic shores Of our distress can Aristides hear. True, answers firm Themistocles, though stung, Nor shall we want him. Is not Cleon here, Nearchus, Lampon, sharers of success In my preceding conflicts? Of no price Is staid Eudemus, Hyacinthus brave? Is not Eudora present, sacred dame, Who will her face majestical unveil Among confederated ranks to bless The Eleutherian banner, and inspire Your populace with all religion's flame? Yon despicable embassy prepare To answer nobly, or let me be heard. Now to this chamber summon all my friends. Timoxenus conven'd them. Swift the chief Dispatch'd them ardent to their native states, Thence their collected citizens in arms, The guardians of Chalcidic walls, to lead. Three days elaps'd; the embassy arriv'd. Amid the senate, on his chair of state, The archon sat. Th' Athenian's sure support Behind is planted. Fierce in tone and look Th' Or?an herald represents his lord: Ye men of Chalcis, Demonax requires That you acknowledge Xerxes; that your gates A Persian garrison admit. Be wise; Refusal draws perdition on your heads. Timoxenus turns pale; his falt'ring lips Make no reply. Th' indignant senate mourn Their state dishonour'd by a timid chief, When timely steps Themistocles in sight; Whose name is murmur'd through th' applauding court. As at the aspect of a single cloud, Known by the trembling seaman to contain Destructive blasts, the sail he swiftly furls With anxious wish for shelter in the lee Of some still shore; the herald thus relax'd His alter'd features. Arrogance abash'd Foreboded ruin from that mighty arm, In vigour brac'd by unexpected health. In act to speak, the hero stretch'd his hand. To fear and impotent distress he seem'd Extending refuge like a poplar tall, Whose grateful branches cool the green descent To some pellucid fountain, where his course Th' o'erweary'd passenger suspends to slake His eager thirst beneath such friendly shade. Bent to provoke the tyrant, and mislead His rashness, thus Themistoclesâhis look Transpierc'd the humbled herald while he spake: Begone, base Greek, from Chalcis. In her name Defiance bear to Demonax, whose head Shall on the gate of Oreus be affix'd; Thine to some trafficker in slaves be sold. To Oreus back th' astonish'd herald flies, On whose report his impious lord incens'd Blasphemes the gods. The Furies he invokes, To them, a human sacrifice, devotes His first Chalcidian captives. From his host Two chosen myriads on the plain he pours. Brave Mindarus, by duty to his king Compell'd to service which his sword abhors, Ariobarzanes, second in command, Barbarian homicide, whose joy is blood, The sev'n GerÃ¦stians sworn to deeds of hell, With Lamachus, of foul mishapen frame, Attend the tyrant, spreading to rude storms His banner fell. So Satan from the north Of heav'n, his region once, with Moloc grim, BeÃ«lzebub and Nisroc, led the host Of impious angels, all the destin'd prey Of Tartarus. Meanwhile th' Athenian sat Serene in Chalcis; his auxiliar bands Successively arriv'd. Eretria sent Twelve hundred spears; Carystus doubled those; Beneath her standard Amarynthus rang'd Eudora's vassals; Styra cas'd in steel Five hundred warriors tried; seven hundred more GerÃ¦stus; Chalcis from her loins supplied Four thousand youths, Nearchus was their chief. Th' Athenian's care had trac'd the region round. A level champaign tow'rds septentrion skies Extends; its western border is the frith, Whose shore is bold, and press'd by waters deep. A line of anchor'd vessels, which o'erlook The land, the chief disposes here; whose crews Were menials, train'd to missile weapons light. Full opposite, and cross the plain, he mark'd A quarry, parent of the domes and tow'rs, Exalting Chalcis o'er EubÅan towns. The subterranean passages by all Inscrutable, but lab'ring hinds, who cleave Earth's marble womb, he garrisons with bands From that rough breed, supported by a force Of heavy-mail'd Chalcideans, left in charge To bold Nearchus. So the watchful bees Within their hive lie dangerous on guard Against invasion of their precious stores, Their industry and state. By morn the care Of active scouts proclaims the adverse host Not far, though yet unseen. The trumpet sounds To fight; Eudora mounts her car, and wields The arms of Dian. Through the spacious streets, Where under ensigns of their sev'ral states The warriors blaze in steel, from band to band She, by her prompter well-instructed, tow'rs Like new-born Pallas from the head of Jove. Her voice exhorts, her sentiments inspire, Her majesty commands them; all are fir'd, All, but Timoxenus. With armed files In safe reserve, though destin'd to remain Behind the walls, he dreads th' important day. His gen'rous daughter, whose distemper'd mind Eudora's converse had begun to calm, Not so debas'd her thoughts; her country's cause She felt; heroic talents she admir'd; Him, who possess'd them all, her heart recall'd, Though with abated passion. All his tale Of Salamis, the stratagem deriv'd From conjugal affection, from the sight Of forms belov'd to animate the brave, Recurr'd; she summon'd to her languid bed The most distinguish'd matrons, them besought To mount the walls, and overlook the fight, In all its terrors. Imitate, she said, The Attic dames, that Chalcis may partake Of Attic glory. They approving went. O mortals, born to err, when most you smart With self-reproach on guilty passion's wound, Attempt one act of virtue! then your breasts Will, like AcanthÃ¨'s now, enjoy a calm. In supplication thus her wonder breaks: Ye lights, who, shining on my darkness, deign To lift the veil of error from my eyes, Protecting pow'rs, accept AcanthÃ¨'s pray'r For this her native city, for a sire Too kind, for great Themistocles, who draws The sword of JusticeâNow with purer lips I sound his nameâAnd, O illustrious dame! Of all Athenian excellence the flow'r, Bless'd in a hero's love, the precious gift Of hymeneal Juno, couldst thou know What I have suffer'd by an envious flame, What still I suffer, while remorse awakes A thought of thee, thy gen'rous soul would melt In pity, ev'n forgiveness, when I vow To ev'ry chaste divinity invok'd, That I will see Themistocles no more. This victory accomplish'd, renders back Her virtue late a captive, which recalls Affections pure, and sanctity of mind, Still thoughts, and hope, restorative of peace. But on a diff'rent victory intent Themistocles within Chalcidic walls Contains his ready host; nor means to throw The portals open, nor display the face Of battle, till the enemies in sight Yield full advantage in his choice of time. So in his deep concealment of green reeds On Ganges' margin, or the flaggy strand Of Niger's flood, from Ãthiopia roll'd, The alligator vigilant maintains His fraudful ambush, that unwary steps May bring the prey to his voracious jaws. End of the Sixteenth Book. BOOK the Seventeenth. Sicinus, long by unpropitious winds Lock'd in GerÃ¦stus, to their fickle breath, Half-adverse still, impatient spread the sail. Six revolutions of the sun he spent To gain Phaleron. To his lord's abode He swiftly pass'd, when chance his wond'ring eyes On Aristides fix'd. An open space Reveal'd the hero, issuing sage commands. Th' omnipotent artificer of worlds From chaos seem'd with delegated pow'r To have entrusted that selected man. From ashes, lo! a city new ascends, One winter's indefatigable toil Of citizens, whose spirit unsubdu'd Subdues calamity. Each visage wears A cheerful hue, yet solemn. Through the streets Successive numbers from adjacent fields Drive odorif'rous loads of plants and flow'rs, Which please the manes. Amaranth and rose, Fresh parsley, myrtle, and whate'er the sun, Now not remote from Aries in his course, Call'd from the quick and vegetating womb Of nature green or florid, from their seats Of growth are borne for pious hands to weave In fun'ral chaplets. From the Grecian states, To honour Athens, their deputed chiefs, Cleander foremost, throng the public place; Whence Aristides with advancing speed Salutes Sicinus: Welcome is thy face, Good man, thou know'st; from Athens long estrang'd, Now doubly welcome. In thy looks I read Important news. Retiring from the crowd, Swift in discourse, but full, Sicinus ran Through all the series of his lord's exploits, Which drew this question: Has thy patron ought To ask of Aristides? Silent bow'd Sicinus. Smiling then, the chief pursu'd: Do thou attend the ceremonial pomp Of obsequies to morrow; when the slain At Salamis receive their just reward From us, survivors by their glorious fall. I have detain'd thee from Timothea long, The first entitled to thy grateful news. Now to that matron, whom beyond himself He priz'd, Sicinus hastens. At her loom He finds her placid o'er a web, whose glow Of colours rivall'd Iris, where intent She wove th' atchievements of her lord. Her skill Had just portray'd Sandauce in the arms Of Artamanes, when her children's doom Congeal'd her breast. Themistocles in look Expresses all that subtlety humane, Which cozen'd superstition of her prey; His godlike figure dignifies the work. Two boys, two lovely little maids, surround Th' illustrious artist, while their eyes pursue Their mother's flying fingers in delight Attentive. But their tutor once in view, From absence long regretted, light with joy To him they bound. Sicinus melts in tears Of soft affection. They around him lift Their gratulating voices, on his neck Cling, and contend for kisses from those lips Approv'd in kindness; as a flutt'ring brood With chirping fondness, nature's sweetest note, Inclose their feather'd parent, who attunes Her tender pipe, and spreads endearing plumes. Sicinus, cries Timothea, thou dost bring Auspicious tidings; from my hero I Expect no less. Unaided by the state, A private man, like Hercules he went, In his own pow'rs confiding, and secure. Sit down, thou witness of my husband's worth, Thyself a proof of his discerning choice In thee, good man, by me and mine rever'd, Discreet and faithful. No, Sicinus spake, Thou art that proof, most faithful, most discreet, Most excellent of women. Come, she said, Suppress my praises; let me hear of none, But his; and copious let thy story flow. Glad through his whole heroic theme the sage, By time to Attic eloquence inur'd, Expatiates large; where loftiness of plan Sustain'd by counsel, with exhaustless art Pursu'd, now brought to valour's final proof, Must end in sure success. His lord's commands Observing strict, AcanthÃ¨'s precious worth, In talents, form and manners, he describes; How she the aid of Chalcis had procur'd, Her favour how Themistocles had won. If he pursue to victory his plan, Timothea said, and borrow from her hand The means of glory, and the gen'ral good, Tell him, that I can imitate with joy AndromachÃ¨, who foster'd on her breast Her Hector's offspring by a stol'n embrace. Not such thy lot, sole mistress of a form Match'd by perfection of the mind alone, Sicinus cheerful answer'd. I attest To this my firm belief th' all-ruling sire, Let Horomazes be his name, or Jove. Thou giv'st me transportâThou hast leave to smile, My good Sicinus, she repliesâBut heav'n I too attest, that transport I conceive Less for my own, than fair AcanthÃ¨'s sake. So amiably endow'd, so clear in fame, Her purity resigning, she, alas! Had prov'd the only suff'rer. Woman fall'n, The more illustrious once, the more disgrac'd, Ne'er can refume her lustre. Laurels hide A hero's wanton lapse. The Greeks would bless The guile which serves them, but to endless shame The gen'rous auth'ress of that service doom. Thou said'st, my husband from Cleander's sword Solicits help; Cleander is my guest With Ariphilia; ready in this port His squadron lies; he plough'd the seas in quest Of earliest action for the common cause. Come, they are waiting for the night's repast. She rose; Sicinus follow'd, and renew'd In Ariphilia's and Cleander's ear The wondrous narrative, but cautious veils AcanthÃ¨'s love. Timothea's looks approv'd. He then concluded: Thus, to battle rous'd, The force of half EubÅa cas'd in steel Against the tyrant Demonax I left; But in the chace of that devouring wolf On thee relies Themistocles for help, Undaunted chief of TrÅzen. He replies: Should I withhold it, by th' immortal gods, The titles both of soldier and of friend Were mine no longer. Ariphilia then, Sweet as a vernal flow'r in early prime, A Grace in manner, HebÃ¨ in her form: Say, gentle sage, of Delphi's rev'rend priest, Of Haliartus, and OÃ¯leus' son, Kind guests of mine, no tidings dost thou bear? He answers: Them in AtalantÃ¨'s isle The turbulent Euripus yet confines; They soon, fair matron, to thy lord and mine Will add their strength and level from its base The tyrant's hold. Amid this converse sweet The warrior-poet Ãschylus appears, A grateful visitant to all. He spake: Fair dame, admit me, introducing men Who saw thy gallant consort yester morn Erecting trophies; men themselves renown'd, OÃ¯lean Medon, and Apollo's priest Long lost, whom I, unknowing of their fate, Have clasp'd in transport, as Laertes' son, When he review'd his metamorphos'd friends In Circe's island to their pristine forms Uprising by her charms. Timothea glad Salutes the ent'ring heroes, Medon known Before, Leonteus, Delphi's holy seer With Artemisia's brother, strangers all, But of deportment to command regard. Then spake the Locrian: First of matrons, hail! On Salaminian sands we parted last. I have been long in AtalantÃ¨'s isle Sequester'd; but, determin'd to attend The fun'ral honours which the morning pays To brave Athenians slain, an hour serene To cross the strait Euripus I embrac'd For Chalcis. There thy consort fresh I found In gather'd palms from Demonax o'erthrown That day in battle. Hear the glorious tale, Which from Themistocles himself I learn'd. He, well-inform'd, the chiefs in either host Distinctly told, their history, their names, Their birth and deeds, on Hyacinthus most, As most esteem'd, enlarg'd. That hapless youth Was husband to Cleora; daughter she Of Demonax was poison'd by her sire. Survey this tablet, which before my sight Thy hero took, with readiness of skill Delineating the fight. Shew this, he said, To my Timothea, friendly thou explain. This part is Chalcis, this a champaign wide; Here flows the sea, there winds a quarry dark. Conceive a river by impetuous floods O'erswol'n, and spread irregular, and wild, Beyond its bounds; tumultuous thus the foes At first appear'd. Expecting to surprise, Themselves surpris'd at unexpected bands, Through open'd portals issuing to the plain, Are forc'd, dishearten'd by a toilsome march, To range their numbers for immediate fight. The wary son of Neocles suspends Th' attack, till bursting drifts of southern clouds Beat on the faces of his harrass'd foes A storm of blinding sleet; then rushes down In three deep columns. Of th' Or?an line The right, which Mindarus conducting wheels Along the sea's flat margin, sore is gall'd By unremitted show'rs from bows and slings On well-rang'd vessels. Lamachus commands The left. Nearchus from the quarry pours An ambush'd force, and breaks the hostile flank. Compact of vet'rans, cull'd from ev'ry state, That wedge of war, whose bristly front display'd Athenian spears and Spartan mingling beams, (Themistocles the leader) slow but sure Bears down the center. At a second breach The line gives way to Cleon, at a third To swift Carystians. Not a life is spar'd By wrong'd, incens'd Eretrians, not a life By Hyacinthus, boiling with revenge For his Cleora; while her cruel sire Exerts a desp'rate valour to revive Hope in an army spiritless by toil, By sudden onset broken, at the name And sight of thy Themistocles abash'd. The rout is gen'ral. In the bloody chace Five thousand slain the conquerors despoil. Thy husband, prudent in success, preserves Two thousand heads, all Persian, to redeem Eretrian captives from the tyrant's bonds. He, thus defeated, not subdu'd, retir'd To Oreus. Pow'rful remnants of his host He, draws within her circuit; furnish'd well From boundless treasure, threatens there to hold A firm defence, till, summon'd by the spring, Mardonius quit Thessalia, and employ The whole confederated pow'r of Greece. That threat Themistocles will render vain, Exults Timothea; he unfinish'd leaves No toil begun. Again the Locrian chief: Now my first duty is discharg'd; the next To Ariphilia from her guest is due. O soft in virtue, elegantly fair, Cleander's favour'd paranymph retains Thy hospitable kindness ever dear; Thine too, my gallant host, by Neptune bless'd In his own priestess, and with brightest fame On his own floods adorn'd. The pleasing hours All spend in mutual gratulation sweet, Till for the morn's solemnity they part. Below th' Ãgalean mountain, where the king Of humbled Asia on his golden throne Was seated late, spectator of his shame At Salamis, a level space extends To Neptune's border. Green Psittalia there Full opposite exhibits, high and large, A new erected trophy. Twenty masts Appear, the tallest of PhÅnician pines, In circular position. Round their base Are massive anchors, rudders, yards, and oars, Irregularly pil'd, with beaks of brass, And naval sculpture from Barbarian sterns, Stupendous by confusion. Crested helms Above, bright mail, habergeons scal'd in gold, And figur'd shields along the spiry wood Up to th' aerial heads in order wind, Tremendous emblems of gigantic Mars. Spears, bristling through the intervals, uprear Their points obliquely; gilded staves project Embroider'd colours; darts and arrows hang In glitt'ring clusters. On the topmost height Th' imperial standard broad, from Asia won, Blaz'd in the sun, and floated in the wind. Of smooth Pentelic marble on the beach, Where flow'd the brine of Salamis, a tomb Insculptur'd rose. Achievements of that day When Asia's navy fell, in swelling forms Fill'd on three sides the monument. The fourth, Unfinish'd, open'd to th' interior grave. Now, through Minerva's populace, who kept Religious silence, first white-vested maids, Who from the strand of Salamis had seen The patriots slain, their sepulchre approach With wreaths and garlands; then of chosen youths A troop, whose valour had the fight surviv'd. The younger matrons, husbands ripe in age, Nor less in fame, succeed. Of either sex The elders follow. Kindred of the dead Come next, their wives, their children. Urns, which hold The sacred ashes, are in open cars Discover'd. One close chariot is reserv'd For them, whose bodies fate from search conceal'd. Last Aristides, in his civil robe, Attracts the gazing multitude; his wheels, Myronides, Xanthippus, Cimon great, Aminias, Ãschylus, and ev'ry chief For prowess known attend. Around the tomb Are plac'd the children; roses in the bud Entwine their brows; their little grasp upholds Green sprigs of myrtle; well instructed, all Refrain from weeping o'er paternal dust, Deposited by glory in the grave. A high tribunal Aristides mounts; Near him, on ev'ry side, are seats assign'd To strangers held in honour. Medon there, Leonteus, Timon, and the brother known Of Caria's queen, Cleander, numbers more From states ennobled in their names are seen. The godlike man uprises; on the tomb His eyes he fixes first; their lustre mild He then diffuses o'er th' assembly vast, Where not a tongue is heard, nor gesture seen. So through unclouded skies the argent lamp Of Dian visits with her light benign A surface broad of water, where no breeze Excites a swell, nor sighs among the reeds. Your fathers, wise and lib'ral, he began, Appointed public obsequies to all Who die in battle for the public good, Ye men of Athens. Not a groan, or tear Must violate their ashes. These have gain'd What all should envy; these, by virtuous death, The height of human excellence have reach'd, Have found the surest path to endless joy With demigods and heroes in those fields, Which tyrants ne'er can enter to molest The blissful region; but are far remov'd To realms of horror, and from righteous Jove Endure the pains they merit from mankind. There, if retaining, as they surely must, The memory of things belov'd on earth, It will enhance their happiness to know Their offspring cherish'd, and their wives rever'd By grateful Athens, whom their glorious fall Exalts, whose daughters they preserv'd from shame, Whose sons from bonds. This bliss benignant Jove, Who loves the patriot, never can withhold From them, who little would deserve that name, Unless those sweetest charities they feel, Paternal cares, and conjugal esteem, The props of public and domestic weal. Them to defend, Athenians, to maintain Inviolate your altars, tombs and laws, Let contemplation of the present rites Give principle new strength. Behold a foe, Who hath profan'd your ancestors in dust. Lo! on a cross Leonidas affix'd, His patriot bones expos'd to bleaching winds By that Barbarian, Xerxes. Kings alone, Obtuse of mind, illiberal, the brutes Of human nature, can devise and act Barbarities like these. But such a foe Leagues Heav'n against him. Nemesis will join With Grecian Mars, and all her furies plant His foot on Asia's boundaries, to shake An impious tyrant on his native throne. Then of the patriot dead, whose swords prepar'd Your way to glory, and achiev'd their own, This recent tomb, when dress'd in eastern spoils, Will best delight their manes, and proclaim To Gods and men your gratitude and arms. He paus'd. Ãgaleos echo'd to the found Of acclamation; Salamis reply'd. But as the sun, when casual clouds before His intercepted light have pass'd away, Renews his splendour, so the righteous man In eloquence and counsel thus again Breaks forth: Xanthippus, in the gales of spring, To brave the coast Barbaric you decree; While, on BÅotia's plains, your phalanx meets Mardonian ranks. Now hear of wond'rous acts To you unknown, unpromis'd, just perform'd By an Athenian. Winter hath not slept Inactive; your Themistocles hath rous'd That sluggish season by the clang of war; A force creating by his matchless art, He hath o'erthrown fierce Demonax, and coop'd Within his fort. Delib'rate swift, my friends, How to assist your hero; Justice calls On ev'ry tongue ingenuous so to style Themistocles; who wants but slender help. Your skill, Athenians, in surmounting walls Excels in Greece. Select experienc'd bands; An instantaneous effort may o'erwhelm Beneath the ruins of his last retreat EubÅa's scourge, whose prevalence might shut That granary of Athens, and transfer To Asia's num'rous camp your needful stores. All in applauding admiration hear Disinterested virtue, which exalts A rival's merit. But thy gen'rous breast, To all superior in sensation high Divine Timothea, entertains a warmth Of grateful rapture in thy lord's behalf, Which shines confess'd. Sicinus, at her side, Condemns his lord, who nothing would request Of Aristides; him, who grants unask'd, His soul adores. Aminias, rising, spake; A fearless warrior, brother to the bard, Like him sincere, less polish'd, learn'd and wise, By right intention more than conduct sway'd: Who can for all deliberate so well, As Aristides singly? Let us fight; But with sole pow'r of counsel and command, Throughout this war's duration, by a law Invest him uncontrollable. Up starts The interrupting patriot, nor permits The people's confidence in him to grow In wild excess: Ne'er yet th' almighty sire Created man of purity to hold A trust like this. Athenians, mark my words; I am your legal military chief; If your immediate safety should require An use of pow'r, unwarranted by laws, I will exert it, not accept as law; The censure or acquittal of my act With you shall rest. At present I advise, That from Phaleron Ãschylus transport Two thousand skilful vet'rans. Him the seed Of Neocles approves; not less in arms Than arts excelling, him your warriors prize. Them, ere two monthly periods of the sun, You cannot want. Thick verdure must invest The meadows, earth her foodful stores mature, Before Mardonius can his numbers lead From Thessaly remote. Ere then, my friends, Themistocles will conquer, and erect Cecropia's standard on Or?an walls; Your timely aid he timely will restore To fill the army of united Greece. The gen'ral voice assents, and all retire, While to her home Timothea brings her guests. To her Sicinus prudent: Not an hour, Till I rejoin thy consort, should be lost. She then: Most faithful, from my arm receive This bracelet rich in gems, Barbaric spoil; Bear this to Chalcis, to AcanthÃ¨ give; Say, how I prize her elevated mind, Enabling my Themistocles to quell The hateful breed of tyrants. Further say, The man engaging her connubial hand I should esteem the favourite of gods. Stay; Haliartus shall the present bear. Thou to my lord a messenger of love Shalt go, Sicinus; words to thee I leave; My heart thou know'st. One fervent wish impart, That he in private, as in public ties, With Aristides may at last unite. So spake the first of women. TrÅzen's chief Subjoin'd: Sicinus, wait till morn; embark With these our friends of AtalantÃ¨'s isle Aboard my squadron; soon will southern gales My succour waft, and jointly we proclaim Brave Ãschylus to follow. Let us greet Him, who our valour into action calls For ev'ry chief to envy; him to clasp My bosom pants, a hero, who surmounts The sloth of winter while so many brave Hang up their weapons. Ariphilia heard, Sat mute and sad. To her Timothea thus: We, who are wives of soldiers, will remain Together, cheerful watch for tidings dear Of their achievements, and rejoice at home. End of the Seventeenth Book. BOOK the Eighteenth. Three days transport Cleander and his friends; Timoxenus admits such welcome guests, Who bring new succours. From Chalcidic walls Th' Athenian chief was absent. With a pace Unstable yet, a calm, but languid mien, To grace her father's board AcanthÃ¨ leaves Her chamber; pale, but fragrant as the rose, Which bears the hue of lilies, she descends. Her soon the Carian, mindful of his charge, Thus with Timothea's salutation greets: A costly bracelet, from her beauteous arm Th' espous'd of great Themistocles unclasp'd On my departure, and in words like these, Of gracious tone, deliver'd to my care: âBear this to Chalcis, to AcanthÃ¨ give; âSay how I prize her elevated mind, âEnabling my Themistocles to quell âThe hateful breed of tyrants. Further say, âThe man engaging her connubial hand âI should esteem the favourite of gods.â Timoxenus is pleas'd; AcanthÃ¨'s cheeks A burning blush of perturbation feel. Not soon recov'ring from a start of thought At the first mention of Timothea's name, She took, she kiss'd the present, and disguis'd Her conscious trouble under busy care To fix the bracelet in its lovely seat. The guests are plac'd around; her presence charms The banquet. Though the lustre of her eyes Grief had eclips'd and sickness, though her mouth Had lost the ruby tinct and pleasing flow, By melancholy silence long confin'd, Her gestures speak the graces of her soul. TrÅzene's captain, lively as the lark Whose trill preludes to nature's various voice, Begins discourse: Perhaps, accomplish'd fair, Thou dost not know the messenger, who brought Timothea's present, Haliartus styl'd; He is deriv'd from Lygdamis, a name, Ionia boasts. His daughter, Caria's queen, Fam'd Artemisia, heroine of Mars, Calls Haliartus brother; but from Greece Could never alienate his truth. His sword From violation, in his first essay Against Barbarian multitudes, preserv'd Bright Amarantha, consort to the king Of Macedon, more noble in her sire, Who sits beside thee, Timon, Delphi's priest. Then Medon: How unwilling do I check Our social converse. Generous host, no tongue Can duly praise thy hospitable roof; Yet we must leave its pleasures; Time forbids Our longer stay. Two thousand Locrian spears, Three hundred Delphians AtalantÃ¨ holds; Them Ãschylus arriving will expect To find in Chalcis. Gladly shall I hail, Timoxenus rejoins, your quick return, To guard these walls. Themistocles is march'd To conquer ÃgÃ¦, rather to redeem Her state aggriev'd, which courts his guardian hand. Sicinus here: Illustrious men, farewell; In ÃgÃ¦ soon Themistocles shall know Of your arrival. Instant he began, All night pursu'd his course, and saw the morn Shine on that city yielded to his lord. To him Sicinus counts the pow'rful aids Expected, large of Aristides speaks, Large of Timothea; in a rapt'rous style Dwells on her wish for amity to bind The two Cecropian heroes. Glad replies Themistocles: On every new event She rises lovelier, more endear'd; her worth Shall meliorate her husband. I obey, Content on this wide universe to see Myself the second, Aristides first; For still he tow'rs above me. Didst thou say, Cleander, Medon, were already come, That Ãschylus was coming? All their force I want, Sicinus; listen to my tale. Last night an ancient personage, unknown, I length of beard most awful, not unlike Tisander, ask'd an audience, and obtain'd My private ear. Themistocles, he said, If I deliver tidings, which import Thy present safety, and thy future weal, I shall exact thy promise in the name Of all the gods and goddesses to wave Enquiry, whence I come, or who I am. First know, that Mindarus, the Persian chief In Oreus, newly for Thessalia's coast Embark'd, whose neighb'ring PagasÃ¦an cape Looks on EubÅa. He this day return'd, And reinforcement from Mardonius brought, Ten thousand spears. Thessalia hath supply'd Three thousand more. An army huge defends Th' Or?an circuit. Further be inform'd That sev'n GerÃ¦stian homicides are sworn To thy destruction. By their secret wiles The house of rich Timoxenus was fir'd; Them in the field hereafter, all combin'd Against thy head, their sable arms will shew; The hideous impress on their shields is death. Farewell, thou hero; if my parting step Thou trace, farewell for ever; else be sure Again to see me in thy greatest need. In mystery, Sicinus, not of heav'n, But human art, immers'd is some event, Which mocks my utmost fathom; but my course Is plain. In fruitless search I waste no thought, Who, as my servant, smiling fortune use, Nor yet am hers, Sicinus, when she frowns. Now mark: One passage winds among the hills Encircling Oreus. When the vanquish'd foe Her bulwarks sought for shelter, I detach'd Eretrian Cleon, Hyacinthus brave, And with Carystian bands Nicanor staid, Who unoppos'd the strong defile secur'd; There shall my banner, strengthen'd by the youth Of ÃgÃ¦, soon be planted; there shall wait, Till each auxiliar, thou hast nam'd, arrive, Then pour on Demonax the storm of war. Let TrÅzen's squadron and th' Athenian ride Before his port, Cleander have the charge. Speed back to Chalcis; publish these resolves. They part. Not long Themistocles delay'd To gain the mountains; nor three days were pass'd When brave Nearchus, Haliartus bold, Th' illustrious brothers of OÃ¯lean race, Great Ãschylus and Timon, with their bands Arriv'd, and join'd him at the strong defile Which now contain'd his whole collected force. Thence he descended on a morning fair, First of that month, which frequent sees the sun Through vernal show'rs, distill'd from tepid clouds, Diffuse prolific beams o'er moisten'd earth To dress her lap, exuberant and fresh, With flow'rs and verdure. Terrible the bands Succeeding bands expatiate o'er the fields. So when an earthquake rives a mountain's side, Where stagnant water, gather'd and confin'd Within a deep vacuity of rock, For centuries hath slept, releas'd, the floods In roaring cataracts impetuous fall; They roll before them shepherds and their flocks, Herds and their keepers; cottage, fold and stall, Promiscuous ruins floating on the stream, Are borne to plains remote. Now Oreus lifts Her stately tow'rs in sight. Three myriads arm'd Before the walls hath Demonax arrang'd In proud defiance. So, at first o'erthrown, AntÃ¦us huge, uprising in his might Fresh and redoubled by his parent earth, Return'd to combat with Alcmena's seed. Wide stretch'd th' Or?an van; the wary son Of Neocles to equal that extent Spread his inferiour number. By a front Not depth of line the tyrant he deceiv'd; But of Athenian veterans he form'd A square battalion, which the martial bard Rang'd on the sea-beat verge; the other wing Is Medon's charge, where thirty shields in file Compose the Locrian column. Ere the word Is giv'n for onset, thus his wonted guard Themistocles addresses: If a troop In sable cuirass, and with shields impress'd By death's grim figure, at my head should aim, Let them assail me; be it then your care, Postponing other duty, to surround, To seize and bear them captives from the fight. He march'd; himself the cent'ral phalanx led; The floating crimson of his plumage known, Minerva's bird his crest, whose terrors shook The bloody field of Chalcis, soon proclaim Themistocles. Now targets clash with shields; Barbarian sabres with Cecropian swords, Euboean spears with spears in sudden shock, Bellona mingles. Medon first o'erthrew Thessalia's line, his temp'rate mind was stung By indignation; Timon bath'd his lance In their perfidious blood; Leonteus gor'd Their dissipated ranks. A chosen troop To their assistance Lamachus advanc'd; Him Haliartus met; his sinewy arm, Which could have quell'd Lycaon, first of wolves, The Erymanthian, or Ãtolian boar, Smote to the ground the miscreant's bulk deform'd, Whose band, recoiling, leave the victor space To drag him captive. Rout and carnage sweep That shatter'd wing before th' OÃ¯lean swords; Not with less vigour Ãschylus o'erturn'd The other. Mindarus in vain oppos'd Undaunted efforts. Pallas seem'd to fire Her own Athenians; Neptune, in the shape Of Ãschylus, seem'd landed from his conch To war, as once on Troy's SigÃ¦an strand; Or to have arm'd the warrior-poet's grasp With that strong weapon, which can rock the earth. Not in the center suddenly prevail'd Themistocles; the sev'n GerÃ¦stians, leagu'd By hell, combining their assassin points Against the hero, for a while delay'd His progress; firmly their united blows His shield receiv'd. So Hercules endur'd The sev'nfold stroke of Hydra; but the zeal Of IolaÃ¼s to assist that god In his tremendous labour, was surpass'd By each Athenian, each Laconian guard, Who never left Themistocles. They watch'd The fav'ring moment; with a hundred spears They hedg'd the traitors round, forbade escape, Clasp'd and convey'd them living from the field. Still Demonax resists; while near him tow'rs Ariobarzanes, moving rock of war In weight and stature. Of EubÅans, forc'd By savage pow'r to battle, numbers low'r Surrend'ring banners, some to Cleon, some To humble Styra's well-conducted sword, And thine, sad youth, a while by glory taught To strive with anguish, and suspend despair, Cleora's husband. Mindarus appears, Who warns the tyrant timely to retreat, Ere quite envelop'd by the wheeling files Of Ãschylus and Medon. Lo! in front, More dang'rous still, amid selected ranks, Themistocles. The monster gnash'd his teeth; His impious voice, with execrations hoarse, Assail'd the heav'nly thrones; his buckler firm He grasp'd, receding to th' Or?an wall; Where, under vaulted sheets of missive arms Whirl'd on his fierce pursuers, through the gates He rush'd to shelter. Thus a mighty boar, Of Calydonian strength, long held at bay, The hunter's point evading, and the fangs Of staunchest hounds, with undiminish'd ire Red in his eyes, and foaming from his jaws, Impetuous plunges in accustom'd woods. Th' Athenian chief, who sees th' incessant storms Of darts and arrows from the rampart's height, Retreats; but swift his numbers, now enlarg'd By yielding thousands of EubÅan race, Distributes round th' invested town to guard Each avenue and station. From the sea Cleander threatens. In his evening tent The gen'ral views the captives; frowns condemn The sev'n GerÃ¦stians to their former chains. The hero smiles on Lamachus, the prize Of Haliartus, and familiar thus: Again, my Tyrian trafficker in slaves, I greet thee: Son of Lygdamis, what praise To thy distinguish'd efforts is not due? This precious head to my disposal yield. He then proceeds to Lamachus apart: Now take thy freedom, villain; to my use See thou employ it, else expect to die. Your land, remember, and your sea are mine; Soon on the head of Demonax this arm Shall dash yon bulwarks; what I speak is fate. Thou hast thy option, go. Sicinus, hear; This man is free; conduct him through the camp. Now from his friends sequester'd, on a couch, Which never care disturbs, he slept till dawn, When, rous'd by heralds from the town, again The leaders he conven'd. Before them came Arbactus, fierce Barbarian, who began: Themistocles of Athens, in the name Of Mindarus the Persian, I defy Thy arm to combat in the listed field; The same defiance to thy boldest chiefs Ariobarzanes sends. If you prevail, The royal host shall quit EubÅa's isle, Which shall submit to Xerxes if you fall. Up Hyacinthus, Haliartus, start Indignant. First the young Carystian spake: Are they so gross in ignorance to hope, Themistocles will stoop to single fight With twice-o'erthrown Barbarians, who, unsafe Behind a rampart, tremble at his pow'r? But if the Persian Mindarus would try A Grecian's single valour, O permit, Themistocles, thy soldier to assert The Grecian fame. The friend of Medon next: The same permission I implore, O chief, Invincible thyself; that all this host May witness my fidelity to Greece. Themistocles subjoins: Barbarian, go, Provide thy champions; ours thou seest prepar'd For honour, not decision of the doom Reserv'd for Demonax; whose final lot Lies in my breast alone. The herald back To Oreus speeds. The prudent chief pursues: My Hyacinthus, all thy wrongs I feel; But, if resentment can afford the grace I ask thee, lend to policy thy arm: Take Mindarus thy captive. From thy proofs Of might and firmness, Haliartus brave, My wish is lifted high in hope to see Ariobarzanes gasping at thy feet. He rises. Straight embattled on the plain, His army shews a formidable gleam To Demonax. Still num'rous for defence Barbarian warriors, and Thessalian, throng The battlements of Oreus. Through the gates, In solemn pace and slow, a herald train Precede their champions. Heralds from the camp Produce th' illustrious Haliartus clad In richest arms, the gift of Caria's queen; A twig of slend'rest laurel, twisted round A shepherd's crook, in portraiture adorn'd His modest buckler. Grim his foe advanc'd In mail blood-colour'd, with a targe of gold, Ariobarzanes. Hyacinthus next Appears in tried habiliments of war, Which on his dearest patron Mars had seen In Marathonian fields. A plumage black, Denoting grief, he carries; on his shield A female image, and the form of Death, Who blasts her graces. Mindarus approach'd In armour studded bright with orient gems; His buckler too a shape of beauty pale, Stretch'd on a fun'ral pyre, exhibits sad; Of pearl her limbs, of rubies were the flames. Ere they engage, the Persian warrior thus: Since my encounter, whether through disdain Or policy I know not, is refus'd By your commander, not through fear I know, Do thou in courtesy disclose thy name, Thy rank in Grecian armies. May'st thou prove In lustre such as Mindarus would chuse To be th' opponent of a satrap's arm. Then tremble, satrap, at my name, the name Of Hyacinthus, fierce the youth returns; Cleora's husband, whom thy barb'rous love Hath wrong'd, whom hell-born Demonax hath damn'd To ever-during torment, shakes this lance, By vengeance pointed and invet'rate hate. Young man, rejoins the Persian, on thy grief I drop a pitying tear, while thou dost wrong Me clear of wrong to thee. No barb'rous love Was mine; unconscious of your nuptial tie, Till she confess'd it to her savage sire, My flame was holy; not a thought impure To violate a right could taint my breast. But that I lov'd her, Hyacinthus, sure He, who her dear perfections knew so well, Must wave his wonder; that her fate o'erwhelms My spirit, never to revive, I feel; That my disastrous passion caus'd her doom, Blame both our fortunes, not my guiltless heart. If yet thy anguish can a moment look Compassionate on meâbut I forgive Unjust reproaches from a grief like thine, Which should, which must exceed my own, my own Exceeding after thine all other woe. Now Hyacinthus melted, but observ'd, That during this sad interview the spear Of Haliartus at his feet had laid Ariobarzanes dead. Heart-stung by shame At his inaction, with so many chiefs, With such an army, and the godlike son Of Neocles spectators, he begins The fight, but recollects that friend's request. The Persian more effeminate desponds At past defeats, and present grief renew'd, Whose weight, though lighter, he less firmly bore, Than did the hardy Greek his heavier share Of woe. Yet fearless he maintains the strife With native force devoid of gymnic skill, In which confiding Hyacinthus oft Inverts his spear, and levels bloodless strokes, Still vigilant to ward the hostile point, Oft o'er his buckler glancing, though impell'd By active strength. At last a pond'rous blow Full on the Persian's front descends; a groan Is heard throughout the rampart as he falls; The groan redoubles, as the victor bears That leader captive to th' investing camp. To his own tent Themistocles admits The Persian's batter'd, but unwounded limbs; He praises Hyacinthus; he consoles The noble foe, commends to healing rest, And at returning morn salutes him thus: If thee unransom'd, Mindarus, I send To Oreus, canst thou pity her estate Curs'd in a monster? Canst thou feel the wound Of thy own glory longer to support The worst of men, excluded by his crimes From heav'n's protection, and the laws of faith? Wilt thou, to spare whole rivulets of blood Greek and Barbarian, render to my arms The town, and thus procure thyself a name To live sor ever, by a righteous act, Delighting gods and mortals? Thee my ships Shall land in safety on thy native shore; The king will praise thee for his army sav'd, Which shall partake my clemency. Reject All hope, good Persian, to withstand my arm; I am Themistocles. The satrap starts From languor thus: Athenian, I confess Thy greatness, thy ascendency have felt; But will endure, whate'er a victor's pow'r Inflicts on captives, rather than pollute My loyal faith to Xerxes; from my king I took my charge, and never will betray. The crimes of Demonax I know; myself Have prov'd their horrors in Cleora's fate, I lov'd, ador'd her excellence; her thread His impious rage dissever'd; on her tomb My tears have daily flow'd. Retain me still Thy captive, never to revisit more Her father's hateful mansion. Heav'n permit, By thy vindictive arm, but heav'n forbid, That ever by disloyalty of mine, Th' infernal author of her death may fall. The barbarism of loyalty, which binds Men to a monarch, but the monarch leaves Free to his lusts, his cruelty and rage, Th' enlighten'd Greek despis'd, yet now deplor'd In one by nature gifted to deserve A better lot from heav'n. Not less aware Of democratic jealousy, which hurls From fortune's summit heroes to the dust, He press'd no further, cautious not to wound A gallant mind, whose friendship won he meant To use in wants, such fortune might create. He leaves Sicinus near him; while his care Exhausts the light in traversing the camp To view the works. His evening orders hold Each band in arms; while anxious in his tent He sits deep-musing, whether to attempt The town that night by storm, or patient wait For some event less bloody, casual boon Of time and fortune. Wasteful is delay, But precious too his soldiers; such brave lives The full completion of his vast design Requires. Thus, dubious, till the second watch Throughout the camp is toll'd, and clouded heav'n Drops down her sable veil, he sits; when lo! Before him stands his monitor unknown, The venerable figure, which he saw At ÃgÃ¦. Staid Sicinus is the guide, Who swift retires, but watches faithful nigh. Themistocles, the stranger solemn spake; Thee I have trusted, thou hast trusted me, Nor either hath repented. Who I am, Now learn. By friendship's sacred ties, by blood To thy best friend Eudora I am bound, Elephenor am call'd, pontific seer Of Jupiter in Oreus. Timely warn'd By her most urgent mandate to repose All confidence in thee, and lend my aid, Nor less admonish'd by Tisander sage, I help'd thee first with counsel; now I bring Effectual succour. Demonax, though foil'd, Hath still a pow'rful remnant of his host To man his walls, and desp'rate will defend. Select two thousand spears; avoid delay; A secret passage, known to holy steps Alone, o'er town and tyrant will complete Thy bloodless conquest. Swift the Attic chief: O father! sacred in my ear the sound Of good Tisander's, great Eudora's names; Thy former warnings I have prov'd sincere To merit gratitude and trust. He calls Sicinus, bids him summon all the chiefs Of Locris and Carystus; they appear. To Hyacinthus and Nicanor then Themistocles: Attend with all your bands This rev'rend guide; intelligence transmit As you advance. His orders are perform'd. Next he exhorts th' OÃ¯lean brethren thus, Nor passes favour'd Haliartus by: You with your Locrians follow to support These friends, lest ambush and deception lurk Beneath a promise of assur'd success. This said, himself forth issues to prepare The gen'ral host for action, ev'n that night, If fair occasion summons, when he meets TrÅzene's leader. Is Cleander here, Themistocles began? Momentous sure, The cause which sends thee from thy naval charge. To him Cleander: Anchor'd as I lay, A slender skiff, when darkness first prevail'd, Approach'd my galley. To an earnest suit For conference I listen'd, and receiv'd On board a man of Oreus, all in limbs Deform'd, in lineaments all rude, whose name Is Lamachus. To render up this night A sep'rate sort he proffers, which commands The town and harbour, if thy faith be pledg'd Him and Thessalia's garrison to land Safe on her neighb'ring coast. Thy will to learn I come, he waits. His proffer I accept, Rejoins th' alert Athenian, and the doom, I had prepar'd for those degen'rate Greeks, Postpone. Cleander to his station flies. Serene th' Athenian in array contains His army cool, with expectation mute. So, in deceitful quiet oft the main Before the glazing light of Dian spreads A mirrour smooth; the ruler of the winds Anon from troubled clouds, and ocean's god From his tempestuous chariot, give the sign For wild commotion; then the surging brine Assails the loftiest tops of reeling masts, Foams on the rocks, and deluges the beach. End of the Eighteenth Book. BOOK the Nineteenth. The morning breaks; Nicanor sudden greets The gen'ral; welcome tidings in these words He utters loud: The citadel is won, The tyrant slaughter'd. With our sacred guide A rugged, winding track, in brambles hid, Half up a crag we climb'd; there, stooping low, A narrow cleft we enter'd; mazy still We trod through dusky bowels of a rock, While our conductor gather'd, as he stepp'd, A clue, which careful in his hand he coil'd. Our spears we trail'd; each soldier held the skirt Of his preceding comrade. We attain'd An iron wicket, where the ending line Was fasten'd; thence a long and steep ascent Was hewn in steps; suspended on the sides, Bright rows of tapers cheer'd our eyes with light. We reach'd the top; there lifting o'er his head A staff, against two horizontal valves Our leader smote, which open'd at the sound. Behind me Hyacinthus on the rock Sunk sudden down, pronouncing in his fall Cleora; I on Hyacinthus call'd. Is this Cleora's husband? cried the priest; Descend, my Pamphila, my wife, descend. She came, a rev'rend priestess; tender both With me assisting plac'd my speechless friend Within a cleft by me unmark'd before, Which seem'd a passage to some devious cell. Me by the hand Elephenor remov'd Precipitate; a grating door of brass Clos'd on my parting steps. Ascend, he said, Make no enquiry; but remain assur'd, His absence now is best. I mount, I rise Behind a massy basis which upheld Jove grasping thunder, and Saturnia crown'd, Who at his side outstretch'd her scepter'd hand. The troops succeeding fill the spacious dome. Last, unexpected, thence more welcome, rose, Detach'd from Medon with five hundred spears, Brave Haliartus, who repair'd the want Of my disabled colleague. Now the priest: Ye chiefs, auxiliar to the gods profan'd, And men oppress'd, securely you have reach'd The citadel of Oreus. The dark hour Befriends your high attempt. Let one possess The only entrance from the town below, The other swift the palace must surprise, Where Demonax lies slumb'ring, if his guilt Admits of rest, and dreams not of your spears. With small resistance from a drowsy guard I seiz'd the gate; the palace soon was forc'd By Haliartus. Demonax maintain'd, From door to door fierce combat, till he sunk, Blaspheming ev'ry pow'r of heav'n and hell, On his own couch, beneath repeated wounds Delv'd in his body by the Carian sword, Whose point produc'd the sever'd head in view. These news, Sicinus, to Eudora bear, Themistocles began. Before her feet Fall grateful, kiss for me her hallow'd robe; My venerable friend Tisander hail, To her, to him, this victory we owe. Salute Timoxenus, my noble host, Greet his excelling daughter; let them hear Of brave Nicanor, and the Carian sword, Which, closing at a blow this dang'rous war, Preserves so many Greeks. Carystian chief, Accept from me good tidings in return For thine. Intelligence this hour hath brought, That vigilant Cleander hath possess'd The naval fort, an inlet to the town For this whole army, pouring from our ships Successive numbers, if the Persian bands Yet meditate resistance. Not to give Their consternation leisure to subside, Against the walls each standard shall advance. He said, and gave command. The diff'rent chiefs Head their battalions. Oreus trembling sees Encircling danger; heralds in their pomp, Dread summoners, are nigh. Her foreign guard, Depriv'd of wonted leaders, at the fall Of Demonax aghast, in thought behold Death in the conquer'd citadel extend His hideous arms to beckon from the fleet Cleander's valour, and from swarming tents Themistocles. On his approach the gates Are thrown abroad. From all the Persian bands Their javelins, shields, and banners on the ground Pale fear deposits. Thus the yielding masts Of all their canvass mariners divest, When Ãolus is riding on a storm To overwhelm the vessel, which would drive In full apparel to resist his ire. Th' Athenian, though triumphant, in his joy Omits no care. To Ãschylus awhile The charge supreme transferring, he ascends The citadel; the Catian victor there Conducts him o'er the palace, shews the corse Of Demonax, his treasury unspoil'd, By chosen Locrians guarded. Pleas'd, the chief Embraces Haliartus: Friend, he said, Though late acquir'd, inestimable friend, How shall I praise thee? but my bosom wrapt In long concealment, now to thee alone Disclos'd, shall warrant my profess'd regard. Know, that whatever thou hast heard, or seen Of my EubÅan labours, are no more, Than preparation for a wider stage Of action. Gold, one necessary means, Thou hast provided; but I want a man Of hardy limbs and vig'rous, bold, discreet, Who all the Persian quarters would explore, On either side ThermopylÃ¦; would trace Whate'er employs Mardonius, what the time He takes the field, and where his gather'd stores Of war deposits. Thessaly provok'd Long since my just resentment. Ere the king Of Asia pass'd the Hellespont, I led Ten thousand Greeks her passes to defend; By her deserted and betray'd, I march'd Unprofitably back. The Carian here: Had I endowments equal to my will, I were that man. Accept me, as I am, Vers'd in those borders, me, whose faithful zeal Leonidas experienc'd and approv'd; So let Themistocles. My rustic weeds I can resume to range th' ÅtÃ¦an crags, The fields of Locris, and Thessalia's plains. Thou art that man, th' Athenian quick rejoin'd; Then hold thee ready. Sudden in their birth Are my resolves, and when mature have wings. This said, he visits Ãschylus below. Judicious he in stations had dispos'd The various bands; the pris'ners were secur'd. Throughout th' Or?an streets and dwellings reign'd Tranquillity and order. Him the son Of Neocles bespake: To-morrow's dawn Shall see thee honour'd, as becomes a chief, Whom Aristides nam'd, and Athens chose To save EubÅa. I defer till night Our consultations. I, not wanted here, Will reascend the citadel; the voice Of friendship calls me to a tender care. He seeks the fane. Elephenor he greets; Applause to him in gratitude unfeign'd Presenting, next his earnest lips enquire Of Hyacinthus. Here the rev'rend man: First know, his dear Cleora is alive. I, priest of Jove, and Pamphila my wife, Who to th' Olympian empress in this feat Of blended rites are ministers, when told That Demonax had doom'd his child to death, Solicited her pardon in the names Of both divinities. At both he spurn'd, While we contriv'd this stratagem. Her nurse, By us admonish'd, in due time declar'd Cleora dead. The body of a slave, A youthful maiden recently expir'd, Was for Cleora carried to the flames, While her we shelter'd in a secret cell, From human sight, from sight of day conceal'd. These pow'rs, alike offended at th' intent As perpetration of an impious deed, Have sent thee forth their instrument of wrath, Divinely-prompted hero. Wilt thou shed On Hyacinthus and Cleora's bliss Thy guardian smile? This utter'd, down the steps He guides th' Athenian to the hidden cell. By his Cleora Hyacinthus sat. The youthful husband o'er the snowy breast, Which lull'd and cherish'd a reposing babe, The blooming father o'er that precious fruit Hung fondly. Thoughtful ecstasy recall'd His dream at Juno's temple; where he saw The visionary bosom of his bride Disclose maternal to an infant new That pillow smooth of lillies. Wan her cheek Told her confinement from the cheerful day. Six moons in deep obscurity she dwelt; Where, as a sea-nymph underneath a rock, Or Indian genie in the cavern'd earth, Her cell in conchs and coral she had dress'd, By gracious Pamphila supply'd to cheat Time and despair. The loom her patient art Had plied, her own sad story had begun, Now to conclude in joy. The starting youth Beholds his patron, rushes on his breast In transport thus: Redeemer of my peace! Balm of my grief! of happiness my source! My health of mind and body is thy gift. If in his anguish Hyacinthus felt His obligation, in the hour of bliss To what excess must gratitude expand His bosom now! Cleora and my child I owe to thy protectionâthis is she, This is my goddess, this my light, my joy, Deriv'd from thy humanity. Thou god Of Hyacinthus, tutelary god! Thou from the pit of horror didst upraise My limbs, for ever to its bottom chain'd Without thy helpful hand; without thee death Had been my portion; never had I liv'd To see Cleora, never known this day! But will my gen'ral overlook my fault? Thy soldier, in his subterranean march Tow'rds this retirement, threw a casual glance, Which met Cleora's. Down the shield and spear Dropp'd from my hands disabled; life forsook My heart, which irrecoverably lost All sense of duty both to thee and Greece, By me alone deserted. Bless that chance, Themistocles replies, and leads aside Th' attentive youth. Perhaps these gods ordain'd, In compensation of thy long distress, In recompense of pure and constant love, That to Cleora thou unstain'd with blood, Blood of her father by another slain, Shouldst be restor'd, nor taint with horrors new This thy new hymen. Ãschylus by morn Will sit in judgment righteous, but severe, On each EubÅan criminal, the dead Not less than living. Instantly remove To thy Carystian home thy wife and babe; Whate'er can pass in Oreus must offend Her eye and ear. Then turning to the fair: From warlike toils thy consort I dismiss; He, who so nobly signaliz'd his sword In single combat, and the open field, And prov'd his valour equal to his love, All future palms to others may resign. Whatever comforts, time and peace can yield, Are due to both your suff'rings; nor an hour Shalt thou be cloister'd in this rueful cell. Elephenor, discreet and rev'rend man, Let thy kind clue conduct their secret steps. With presents laden, tokens of my love, Cars shall attend them at the cavern's mouth; Thou add thy blessing, that their new-born day May never set in sorrow. Thus the chief, Relax'd from busy care, amid success, Which not a shade of obstacle o'erhangs, Spake, as he felt, remunerating full For all his service Hyacinthus brave. His knees embracing, thus Cleora spake: I have not utt'rance for my grateful heart; If thou dismiss us never more to see Thy guardian face, our day will set in grief. In smiles th' Athenian dissipates that fear: Long ere thy husband's magisterial term Is finish'd, I have further still to crave From him as archon, not as soldier, help. This to Carystus would alone direct My footsteps; else amid domestic joys To see thy days illumin'd, precious time Themistocles would borrow from his charge. Thus in the grateful fair-one he secur'd Another friend, if wanted to support His vast designs, which, gath'ring on his mind, Speed his departure with a kind farewell. The cars he orders, from the tyrant's stores Rich presents draws, to Ãschylus returns, With him in conf'rence spends remaining day. Aurora hears Themistocles command Stern proclamation by the trumpet's voice For judgment on the guilty. All in chains The tyrant's hated counsellors are brought, Save Lamachus by faith of treaty safe Bound to Thessalian shores; but chief the sev'n GerÃ¦stian ruffians, their assassin heads Hang hopeless down. Amid the widest space In Oreus lofty a tribunal stands, Which Ãschylus ascends, commander high Of troops enroll'd by Athens. So her son Disgrac'd, but courting favour new, devis'd Her democratic jealousy to sooth. The various chieftains, through this glorious war So late distinguish'd, round the solemn seat Conspicuous wait, Themistocles himself At the right hand of Ãschylus. He sits Like Minos sage, whose justice gain'd from Jove Th' appointment awful to condemn, or spare His fellow mortals in the world below. When now th' accusers and accus'd were heard, Thus spake the warrior-poet: Crimes like these The legislator punishes with death; Let us attempt within our scanty sphere, Far as we may, to imitate the gods In punishment deserv'd. Through those abodes Which Hades governs, long the vulture gnaws; Long is the toil of Sisyphus; to fill Their leaking vases long the murd'rous seed Of Danaus must strive. By labour, pain, And shame continu'd, let flagitious men Long wish to end their suff'rings, not enjoy That wish'd-for period in a single pang. This heavy sentence on assassin heads, On foul atrocious counsellors of ill, Lo! I pronounce. An ignominious brand Imprint on every forehead; plunge them chain'd, Debas'd by vile impurity of garb, In deep Chalcidian quarries; give them food Just for endurance of continued toil, With daily stripes, that cruelty may feel What she inflicts on others, and, impell'd By desperation, court relief in death. Before the gate of Oreus on a cross Extend the limbs of Demonax; the flesh Let kites deform, let parching air the bones Of that despotic malefactor bleach, Avenging man, and vindicating heav'n. Flow next a strain more pleasing through the ear, A strain delightful to that fav'ring god Who first created laurel to adorn The good and brave. A chaplet from his tree, Ten captives, ten selected suits of arms To ev'ry leader; one Barbarian slave, A sabre, targe, whatever to the field Accouters one Barbarian, I allot To ev'ry soldier. Phoebus will supply His laurel too, encompassing your brows, Ye gen'rous people. But a splendid store Of tripods, urns, and images provide For great Eudora, and th' Eretrian seer, That your triumphal off'ring may emblaze EubÅa's fanes; nor less with honours greet Elephenor, your genius of success. Eudora's portion thou, heroic priest, Phoebean Timon, to her presence bear. I need but name AcanthÃ¨ to attract Your veneration; for AcanthÃ¨ chuse, Sweet paragon of Chalcis, from your spoils The costly tissue of Barbaric looms, And dazzling gems, that gratitude may vie With obligation. Haliartus, bright In recent glories from a tyrant slain, Thou at her feet the precious tribute lay. For me, if, servant of Cecropia's state, I have upheld her justice and renown, Your approbation is the sole reward Which I solicit, or will bear away On my returning keel. He ceas'd. In roar Surpassing waves, which beat the craggy strand Amidst a tempest, from the gen'ral host Broke forth applause. Themistocles subjoin'd: Awhile, my friends, your labours I suspend; Go to your homes; to kind, expecting wives Recount your trophies; let your children see Paternal mansions hung with Asian spÃ²ils. Remember still, that valour must not sleep; That law restor'd and freedom are not firm While Asia's trumpet sounds a blast in Greece. Two days elapse; Timoxenus, arriv'd From Chalcis, joyful gratulation brings. Solicitous th' Athenian first enquires Of fair AcanthÃ¨'s state. The father fond Thus answers: Wasting malady is fled, But hath behind it left indiff'rence cold To ev'ry joy. Thy wife a bracelet sent; These words the bearer Haliartus brought, Charg'd by Timothea elegant and wise. âFrom me this present when AcanthÃ¨ takes, âSay, how I prize her elevated mind, âEnabling my Themistocles to quell âThe hateful breed of tyrants. Further say, âThe man engaging her connubial hand âI should esteem the favorite of heav'n.â I heard approving; on the grateful hint A secret hour I chose; my daughter's ear I thus address'd. âMy only child and hope, âShall no sweet offspring cheer a grandsire's age? âShall my possessions to a stranger pass, âMy blood be lost for ever? Shall this war, âThy work, AcanthÃ¨, which a father's love, âIn all to thee complying, at thy suit âCommenc'd, produce no hero to console âThy widow'd couch?â âThe sacrifice of life, âOf my ideal, or my real peace, âIs due to such a father,â she exclaim'd In pious fervour. âArguments to urge âAgainst thy plea my age and thine forbid; âBut ah! dear parent, my capricious fate âPresents no suitor to thy child's esteem.â The Amarynthian priestess, whose controul Surpasses mine, with sternness oft enforc'd My just desire. At length my daughter thus On my departure: âI obey; consult âThemistocles; let him a consort name, âWho best hath serv'd him in this righteous war.â Ne'er yet ill chance, or sorrow, from the son Of Neocles drew tears. His soul reflects On this transcendent fair one, who had chang'd The violence of passion to respect So confidential, dress'd in sweetest grace So far beyond his merits tow'rds a heart Of purest texture, late by him misled To error, now to purity restor'd By native honour. At th' affecting thought He turns those eyes, till then of stedfast look On all events and objects, turns aside To hide their oozing dews; yet soon he spake: None can I name, but wise Timothea's choice To bear her present, Haliartus brave, Who hath avow'd to Ãschylus and me A veneration for thy matchless child; But he, appointed to a service high, Like Hercules must labour yet to gain The sum of bliss. For three successive moons He must continue mine. The past events In copious strains the hero now rehears'd, Concluding thus: The army I disband; Great Ãschylus for Athens straight embarks; I shall remain in Oreus to compose This troubled city; thou resume thy way; The criminals transported in thy train Lock in the quarries; to AcanthÃ¨ all Unravel; her and Chalcis too prepare For due reception of that happy man, Whom Jove hath honour'd in a tyrant's death, Whom Juno soon in nuptial ties will bless, And all EubÅa to AcanthÃ¨ sends With tokens rich of public praise and love. With joy Timoxenus assents; the morn Sees him depart; at Chalcis he arrives, Performing all Themistocles enjoin'd. Now ev'ry temple breathes perfumes; prepar'd Are chosen victims, colonnades and gates With chaplets hung; the garden's flow'ry growth, Each scented produce of luxuriant fields, The maids and matrons bear to welcome home Triumphant warriors. Now th' expected gleams Of armour tinge the champaign's utmost verge; Near and more near the military pomp, At large develop'd o'er the green expanse, Spears, bucklers, helmets, plumes, Barbaric spoils In trophies pil'd on hollow-sounding cars, Grow on the sight. Through Chalcis lies the march; Those in abode the most remote precede. GerÃ¦stian banners first Eudemus shews; With Lampon follow Styra's gallant troop; The Amarynthian and Carystian bands Nicanor leads; th' Eretrians, now become Once more a people, with their wives and race At length redeem'd, to Cleon's orders move. In blooming garlands had the mothers deck'd Their children's heads, whom, tripping through the streets, Spectatress equal to the loftiest scene, Eudora blesses. Sweet AcanthÃ¨ melts In tears of gladness, while her father nigh Awakes attention to a num'rous train, Her native friends, whom brave Nearchus heads. These are thy warriors, fondly cries the sire; To whom Eudora: Who is he in state Pontifical, a holy man in arms? Three hundred Delphians then were passing by, PhÅbean branches twisted round their spears. Behind them, lodg'd on axles rolling slow, Were vases, tripods, images and busts, Spoils of the palace Demonax had rais'd. Thou seest, replies Timoxenus, a form To PhÅbus dear, the venerable form Of Timon, priest and soldier. From that car He will descend to kiss thy sacred hand, Before thy feet a precious tribute lay For thy pure goddess, sister of his god. But look, my sweet AcanthÃ¨, on the man Themistocles hath chosen to revive My drooping years. Preceded by a troop Of youths, whom Medon, ever kind, hath cull'd From all his Locrian files to grace his friend; Preceded by a trophy, which displays The silver mail of Demonax, his shield, His helm of gold, his variegated arms, And spear in length ten cubits, which upholds The tyrant's head, his victor meets our eyes, Th' illustrious son of Lygdamis. She cast Not an impassion'd, but revering glance On one, whose might victorious had dissolv'd EubÅan thraldom, one of noble frame, In feature comely, and in look serene, Whom her sole guide, the all controlling son Of Neocles, had destin'd for her lord. Her dream recurs; the tyrant's head she sees; Th' exploit sublime, though not by him achiev'd, Whom partial fancy on her pillow shew'd, Her ever-wakeful loftiness of mind Admires impartial, and applauds the hand Which dealt the glorious blow. Her awful brow The priestess softens to a smile, and thus: Is this the suitor, whom my hero chose For bright AcanthÃ¨? Favour'd by the gods, Themistocles in ev'ry action proves He cannot err. AcanthÃ¨ hears, and press'd By duty's insurmountable controul, Aw'd by Eudora's majesty austere, Resolves to meet him with becoming grace, But of his virtue make one trial more. The Delphian priest and Haliartus quit Their chariots; them Timoxenus receives To his rich mansion and a sumptuous board. Eudora there, with curious eyes and voice, Explores and questions oft the Carian brave. His Delphian friend, observing, in these words Besought him: O, distinguish'd by the gods! Who have in thee their care of virtue shewn, Since from EubÅa thou must soon depart, Lose not the present hour. These matchless dames Must hear thy wond'rous narrative at large; For singular thy fortunes with events Are interwoven to delight the ear, Affect the heart, and win th' applauding tongue; That all may honour thy desert supreme Like me, so much thy debtor. Straight complies The modest Carian; list'ning silence reigns. In native windings from his Lydian fount As various flow'd MÃ¦ander, here along A level champaign, daisy-painted meads, Or golden fields of Ceres, here through woods In green arcades projecting o'er his banks, There shut in rock, which irritates the stream, Here by low hamlets, there by stately towns, Till he attained the rich Magnesian seat; Thence with augmented fame and prouder floods Roll'd down his plenteous tribute to the main: So through the mazes of his fortune winds In artless eloquence th' expressive strain Of Haliartus, from his peasant state To scenes heroic. Humble still in mind, Compell'd to follow truth's historic clue, He ends in glory, which his blushes grace; Nor less they grace these frank and manly words, Which to AcanthÃ¨ singly he directs: Such as I am, thou elevated fair, Who hast EubÅa's liberty restor'd, Her grateful off'rings to thy feet I bring; With them an humble suppliant to thy smile, That he may rank thy soldier, in thy name His own distinguish, and, achieving well The task by great Themistocles impos'd, Deserve AcanthÃ¨'s favour. She replies With virtuous art: Can soldiers never know Satiety of fame? must her career Be still beginning, never be complete? Must ev'ry passion yield to thirst of praise? Should I request thee, wouldst thou for my sake Thy new attempt relinquish, to enjoy Thy ample portion of acquir'd renown In peace at Chalcis? Haliartus then: Not love of fame, which oft'ner frowns than smiles, Not victory, nor spoil inflate my breast All unaspiring. Sense of duty pure, Of obligation, which I owe to Greece, Themistocles, and Medon, rules supreme Within my soul. O first of mortal fair, Thou of his peace thy servant might'st deprive; But, wert thou fairer than the Paphian queen, In each excelling art like Pallas skill'd, Her paragon in wisdom, thy request Should thus be answer'd from a bleeding heart: To my performance of the trust repos'd The only bar is fate. Astonish'd gaz'd Timoxenus; nor knew the timid sire That his AcanthÃ¨'s breast then first conceiv'd A spark of passion, but a spark divine, Such as for heroes goddesses have felt; As Thetis glow'd for Peleus. Thus the fair: O most deserving of that hero's choice, To which alone AcanthÃ¨ left her fate! Weigh'd in the balance, nor deficient found, Thou more than worthy of a hand like mine! Go, but return; triumphantly return Lord of AcanthÃ¨; of my truth unchang'd Accept this pledge. She gave, he kiss'd her hand. Eudora's vestment, while the solemn scene Her looks approv'd, with fervent lips he touch'd; Then, clasping glad Timoxenus, retir'd To hoist his canvass in the morning gale. End of the Nineteenth Book BOOK the Twentieth. An April zephyr, with reviving sweets From gay EubÅa's myrtle-border'd meads, Perfumes his breath, scarce ruffling in his course The pearly robe of morn. A ready skiff The Carian hero mounts; the gale, though soft, To him is adverse. From a rapid keel Of Oreus, lo! Sicinus lifts a sign Of salutation. Haliartus joins The faithful man, and joyfully relates His acquisition of AcanthÃ©'s hand. To good Sicinus grateful sounds the tale, Who thus replies: To Athens I proceed. No sooner march'd the warriors to their homes, Than, disengag'd from public care, my lord Address'd me thus: Sicinus, spread the sail. To Athens fly; my wife and offspring waft To my embraces; that, while gentle rest Remits the labours of my limbs disarm'd, I with Timothea, she with me, may share The past success, and taste of present joy. Thee, Haliartus, she esteems; thy fame, Exploits and fortune will augment her bliss. But of this friendly gale a moment more I must not lose. His vessel sails along; The other slowly with laborious strokes Of oars contends for passage, till broad noon Flames on the laurell'd poops and colours gay Of Athens and TrÅzene; on whose decks, Emblaz'd with spoils, and trophies, PhÅbus pours His whole effulgence. Back to Attic strands They steer in view. To fifes and trumpets clear From ev'ry vessel in a blended sound Reply the concave shores. Now sudden shifts The wind, and checks their progress; but permits Glad Haliartus close behind the helm Of Ãschylus to pass. The choral notes Of triumph then were hush'd. The warrior-bard, Who had so well accomplish'd all his charge, Like Jove in judgment, on the plain like Mars, Sat in oblivion of his arms, which lay Beside him. O'er the Heliconian hill In thought he wander'd, and invok'd the Muse To sing of civic harmony. The Muse To Aristides, and the conqu'ring son Of Neocles united, touch'd the lyre With melody rejoicing at their names. The Attic warriors throng'd the silent decks, The shrouds and yards. Attention clos'd their lips, Their minds were open'd. Musical and learn'd, Minerva's chosen people had been wont To hear his numbers in the tragic scene. Sententious weight of poesy, combin'd With music's pow'rful spell, there tam'd the rude, Abash'd the vicious, and the good refin'd, Oh! Artemisia, Haliartus sigh'd, While at the strain his progress he delay'd, How canst thou splendid vassalage prefer In barb'rous climes, the residence of slaves, To Greece, the land of freedom, arts and arms, The legislator's and the hero's seat, The guardian pure of equity and laws, The nurse of orphans helpless and oppress'd, Of all, whom PhÅbus and the Muses lift Above the rank of mortals! Greece, I owe More than my birth and being to thy love, My sentiments I owe. Adopted child, For thee my better parent now I go To hazard all in voluntary zeal, Ev'n the possession of AcanthÃ¨'s charms. On AtalantÃ¨'s sea-beat verge he lands; Swift he collects his peasant weeds, the crook, The pipe and scrip, thus musing: Ancient garb, Thou dost remind me of OÃ¯leus good, Dost summon all my gratitude to prove, That he, who benefits receives, and feels A grateful sense, is happy. From his side, His arm, and temples, he ungirds the sword, The shield releases, and unclasps the helm; These he commits, Sophronia, to thy care, Spouse of Leonteus, mother of the race OÃ¯lean. Them, in tenderness embrac'd, He leaves with blessings, re-embarks and prints His bounding feet on Locris. Hermes thus In shepherd's weeds his deity conceal'd, By Jove's appointment on the flow'ry meads Of Inachus alighting; where he stole On watchful Argus, and, his hundred eyes Eluding, rescu'd from her bestial form Afflicted Io. Like the mountain roe The son of Lygdamis in speed excell'd; He, had he run for Atalanta's love, Would have rejected Cytherea's aid, Nor, of her swiftness to beguile the fair, Before her steps the golden apples thrown. He quits the shore impatient; on he flies Unquestion'd, rank'd among the Locrian hinds, All Persian subjects now. A midnight course To Oeta's well-known mountains he prefers Through winding vallies, sprinkled with his tears In memory of past events. He finds The track to Mycon's hut; that goat-herd hears The sound of footsteps through the morning dew; He sees, he flies to MelibÅus, clings Around his neck. The seeming shepherd thus: Kind friend, inform me of Melissa's weal. To him the swain: In wonder thou wilt hear, That no Barbarian dares ascend this hill; Th' attempt with death Mardonius would chastise. Benign Masistius, who his freedom gain'd From gen'rous Medon, to his sister thus The benefit repays. He often views ThermopylÃ¦, inspects th' obsequious band, Which guards the cavern'd passage to our fane; The fane he visits. Pleas'd, Melissa greets The gentle Persian, who delights to speak Of Aristides righteous and humane, Of Medon's valour on Psittalia's isle, Who made Masistius captive. Thus at times The tedious winter's melancholy hours She sooth'd; depriv'd of thee, superior swain, At times convers'd with Mycon. She hath tun'd My pipe to music, purify'd my tongue, Refin'd its language, and my soul enlarg'd. Despairing never of the public weal, To Aristides, virtuous guardian pow'r Of Greece, she strikes her celebrating chords. So will she, Mycon, to the conqu'ring son Of Neocles, our second guardian pow'r, Cries Haliartus; but too long I wait To hail my holy mistress. She, rejoins The swain, hath left this mountain. Forty days, Since I beheld Masistius, are elaps'd; His welcome hand before Melissa plac'd A woman, rather deity in form; The hoary temple with her beauty seem'd Illumin'd; regal was her state; her spouse, The youthful king of Macedon, was by. She, in Melissa's presence, cast aside Her majesty; a suppliant in these words, Whose strong impression I retain, she spake: âMost gracious, learn'd, and prudent of thy rank, âIn Greece the highest, I, in Delphi born, âPhÅbean Timon's child, a pious suit âBoth in my father's and Apollo's name âTo thee prefer. TrachiniÃ¦'s neighb'ring walls âContain the object of my tend'rest care, âSandaucÃ¨, thither from Emathian bounds âFor help convey'd. Masistius will confirm, âWhate'er I utter in SandaucÃ¨'s praise. âHer virtues more than equal her estate âOf princess, Xerxes' sister; but her woes âAlmost exceed her virtues. Nature droops âBeneath its burden, sickness wastes her youth, âResists all med'cine, while her feeble frame âTo dissolution verges. O belov'd âBy ev'ry Muse illumining thy mind âWith ev'ry science, holy woman, fam'd âAmong these nations for benignant deeds, âVouchsafe, descending from thy pure abode, âTo grant thy healing aidâ. Masistius then: âThis is the princess, who her husband saw âSlain at her feet, her infants doom'd to death âBy Euphrantides; never since that day âThe wound inflicted on her gentle heart âAdmitted cure.â The charitable suit Prevail'd, and soon TrachiniÃ¦'s gates receiv'd The priestess borne in Amarantha's car. Here Haliartus: Hast thou never seen, Among the Persians who frequent this hill, A youth in rosy vigour, by the name Of Artamanes known? I have, returns The goat-herd; he with Amarantha came; Scem'd doubly anxious for Melissa's help To yon afflicted princess; urg'd the suit In Medon's name, his friend and saviour styl'd, Who made him captive on Psittalia's shore. But on his cheek the roses, thou dost paint, No longer bloom; his visage, worn and pale, Denotes some inward malady, or grief. Now, MelibÅus, to my longing ear Thy history unfold. We parted last, Thou mayst remember, on this fatal spot. The gentle Agis from this point survey'd Yon froth of torrents in their stony beds, Yon shagged rocks, and that disastrous pass Beneath us; whence Barbarian numbers huge O'erwhelm'd, ThermopylÃ¦. But first accept Refreshment. Under hairy boughs of pines A rustic board he piles with oaten loaves, Dry'd fruits and chestnuts; bubbling nigh, a spring Supplies their bev'rage. Here th' illustrious son Of Lygdamis recounts a copious tale To wond'ring Mycon; but his birth conceals, And consanguinity with Caria's queen. He stops to note the narrow passage throng'd With laden mules and camels. Mycon then: These are my constant spectacle; his host Mardonius now assembles. He transports, Alpenus, yonder Locrian town, receives The gather'd produce of Thessalia's fields; NicÃ¦a's fort contains an equal store, Preparatives for war. Where lies the camp, The Carian questions? On the Malian plain, Which Oeta's cliffs command, the swain reply'd. New tents on clear Spercheos daily rise Of Persians banded from their winter holds; Thou shalt behold them; follow. Both proceed Along the green expanse Melissa lov'd; Where genial spring had form'd of tufted shrubs A florid cincture to the lucid pool Behind the dome, inviolable seat Of all the Muses. Thence harmonious nymphs, Part of Melissa's ministerial choir, Left in their function, with mellifluent voice To harps in cadence true enchant the soul Of Haliartus, doubly charm'd to hear Leonidas the theme. With numbers sweet His praise inwoven by Melissa's skill Was their diurnal song. But sorrow soon Invades a breast, where gratitude presides; The time and place to Haliartus rise, Where he and Medon took their last farewell Of that devoted hero. In a sigh The Carian thus: O well-remember'd scene Once to these eyes delectable! Thy flow'rs Have lost their odour; thy crystalline pool Is dull in aspect to my sad'ning sight; You cannot sooth, melodious maids, the pain Of recollection; starting at the name Your measures sound. Beneath yon solemn beech Regret sits weeping; LacedÃ¦mon's king There of terrestrial music heard the last From Ãschylus, the last of banquets shar'd With good OÃ¯leus' daughter. Mycon here: Suppress this grief; the priestess has forbid All lamentation for that hero's fate, Who died so glorious. Follow to the cliff. They soon attain a high projecting point, When Haliartus in a second sigh: Here stood Melissa; from her sacred lips The queen of Caria hence endur'd reproof; Hence did the great Leonidas explore Th' advancing Persians, when his prudent care The trees and marble fragments had amass'd, Which from the mountain overwhelm'd below Such multitudes of foes. But, Mycon, speak, What is that cross beside the public way? Ah! MelibÅus, let thy spirit grieve Like mine, exclaims, in gushing tears, the swain; Lo! Xerxes' coward vengeance! Thou behold'st Leonidas suspended on that cross. As oft, when lightning strikes the human frame, The wound, though imperceptible, destroys Each vital pow'r throughout the stiff'ning limbs, Which still retain their posture; rigid thus Is Haliartus; riveted to earth He seems, nor utters sound, nor breathes, nor moves His ghastly eyeballs. Now, when Mycon thrice His name repeated, briefly he replies: I am benumb'dâConduct me to a cell Where I may slumberâTend thy herdâExpect Me at thy home. A mossy cave is nigh; There Mycon leaves him. Haliartus stays, Not slumb'ring, but, when Mycon is remote, Darts from the shelter, traverses a wood, Descends a crag, which bounds the upper straits, Thence winds his rapid journey to the cross, Which stands a witness of Barbaric rage. His ardent zeal to free those honour'd bones Admits no pause. The midnight watch is past; Importunate and hateful, birds obscene Are gather'd round; disturb'd, their grating shrieks They mix, and clatter their ill-omen'd wings. A station'd guard is rous'd; resistless force Surrounds the Carian, seizes, leads him bound Before the chieftain of a camp advanc'd. He, at the sight of Haliartus charg'd With guilt, whose punishment is death, commands Th' accusing soldiers to retire, and thus: Alas! hath sorrow so impair'd the hue Of Artamanes, that oblivion masks His face from Haliartus. Thee I know, Thee Meliboeus once, benignant swain, My comforter in bondage, when we plough'd The Grecian seas in Delphian Timon's bark. Was not I present, when the genuine seed Of Lygdamis in thee Aronces trac'd? But, O! illustrious brother of a queen Ador'd in Asia, what disastrous star Thy midnight steps misguided, to incur The king's immutable decree of death? Thy bold attempt was virtuous, but his will Hath made thy virtue criminal. Thy head At his own peril Artamanes still Shall guard; thy liberty accept; myself Will be thy guide to safety. Ah! replies The gen'rous son of Lygdamis, and clasps The meritorious Persian, I perceive Still unimpair'd thy virtues; but receive Thy noble proffer back. For my behoof Not with its shadow danger shall approach My friend; thy pris'ner let me rest till morn. A lib'ral garb is all the boon I crave, Then to Mardonius lead me; tell my crime, No grace solicit; who I am, conceal. In tears, replied the satrap: Then thou diest; The royal edict cannot be controll'd. It can, return'd the Carian; rest assur'd, My preservation in myself I bear. Oh! that with equal certainty my pow'r Might from thy bosom chace that inmate new, Whate'er it be, which violates thy peace, Thy early youth disfigures, and consumes Its fruit unripe. Ah! tell me, is it grief For some dead friend, or sickness, or the smart Of injury, or love? AcanthÃ¨ wak'd That tender thought, which soften'd on the tongue Of Haliartus. From the Persian's breast A sigh, deep note of agony, which riv'd His gentle heart, accompanied these words: Endear'd associate in affliction past, Thou, and thou only, dost unlock the breast Of Artamanes. It is love, my friend; The object, once possessing ev'ry charm Exterior, still each beauty of the soul, By malady incurable devour'd From day to day is hast'ning to the tomb. Oh! long deplor'd SandaucÃ¨; thee my steps Shall follow closeâMy passion is unknown To her; peculiar was her state and mine, Too delicate at first for me to speak, For her to hear. My hopes malignant time Hath wasted since, my health in her decay. But while my heart is bleeding for my love, The sluice grows wider, and to friendship pours A stream enlarg'd. Thy dangerâAh! permit, That I reveal thy origin and rank; Thy sister's name can shake the king's decree. No, Artamanes, by th' immortal gods, Rejoins the Carian; of my just attempt, I, if succeeding, all the merit knew, If taken, knew my ransom. But the stars, Half through their circles run, suggest repose. May grief-asswaging heaviness of sleep Embalm thy eyelids, and like mine thy breast Feel no disquiet; mayst thou rise again, Saluting hope the harbinger of peace. Stretch'd on a carpet Haliartus slept; Not so the troubled Persian, long disus'd To lenient rest. Before the dawn he rose; Among the Greek auxiliars he procur'd Apparel fair of Greece. His Carian guest Attir'd he guided o'er the Malian beach, To that august pavilion, which contain'd The royal person once, Mardonius now In all the state of Xerxes, save the crown. Thus Artamanes: See a hapless man, Who hath attempted to remove the corse Of Sparta's king. That hapless man must die, Returns the gen'ral; Xerxes so ordain'd, Not I. Then absent on a charge remote, Mardonius knew not, nor approv'd when known, Th' indignity that noble corse sustain'd. To him the Carian: Mindarus to death, With hecatombs of nobles thou decreest, Who in Euboea will appease my ghost. Ha! who art thou, in agitation spake The satrap? Guard, bid Lamachus approach, Our visitor so recent from that isle. He was not far; the son of Gobryas thus Address'd him ent'ring: Note that stranger well. Why dost thou start? Themistocles can boast No bolder warrior, Lamachus exclaim'd; I was his captive in th' Or?an fight. Again the Carian: Truth for once he speaks; I dragg'd him bound my captive on that field; Ariobarzanes felt me; further learn, By me the savage Demonax was slain. But to have rescu'd from inhuman wrong The mortal part of that transcendent man, Who living shook all Asia with dismay, Had been my proudest boast. Mardonius then: By Horomazes, I admire and prize Thy gen'rous flame, brave warrior! Under charge Of Artamanes in TrachiniÃ¦'s round Awhile remain. Now, Lamachus, ascend Some ready bark; revisit yonder isle; This Greek for Mindarus exchange; redeem The rest of Asia's nobles; I allot For each a talent. In these words salute Themistocles: âTo Athens I have sent âYoung Alexander, Macedonia's prince, âAmbassador of friendship; I would call âThemistocles ally; himself may name, âBut Persia's bounty shall exceed his price. âThis if his Attic arrogance rejects, âTell him, Mardonius, who disdains a war âOf oars and sails, the dubious ocean's sport, âWill give him battle on the plains of Thebes.â Though Artamanes joyfully beholds His friend in safety, with a trembling step TrachiniÃ¦'s gates he passes to the roof, Which holds SandaucÃ¨. Ent'ring, he perceives Melissa. She, transported at the sight Of Haliartus, thus began: O friend! Dear to my sire, to all th' OÃ¯lean house, What unexpected ecstacy were mine At thy appearance, ifâAh! Persian lord, SandaucÃ¨, sweet SandaucÃ¨, yields to fate. Her dying lips on Artamanes call; Soft gratitude o'erflows her gentle breast; Her wish is eager, ere she breathe her last, To see her friend and guardian. Ending here, She moves before him; with unstable feet, With other prompters, anguish and despair, He follows. Pallid on her mournful couch The princess lies; her infants weep around; Bright Amarantha in disorder'd garb, Unloosen'd hair, and frantic with distress, Stands nigh. The graces sadden on her front; Her beauteous eyes a gushing torrent pour Like overswelling fountains, once serene The lucid mirrors to encircling flow'rs, Now troubled by a storm, which levels round The growth of shade, and scatters on their face Uprooted shrubs in bloom. Her languid lips At length unclosing, thus SandaucÃ¨ spake: Omniscient God of nature! let me lift My voice appealing. When before me lay Autarctus slaughter'd, when these babes, condemn'd By cruel rites, to sacrifice were led, Did not the creature of thy tend'rest mold Feel as a wife, a mother, and receive A cureless wound? Thy providence uprais'd A kind protector through my lengthen'd walks Of grief, till now they terminate in death. If to his gen'rous purity of care, Assiduous, kind and pious, time hath rais'd Within my breast a secret, soft return, Was this an error? Hath my heart abus'd The sensibility, thou gav'st? Alone Art thou my judge. Creator, I obey; Before thy awful presence thou dost call SandaucÃ¨'s youth; unconscious of a crime, My debt avow'd of gratitude I pay By this confession of my fleeting breath To Artamanes. O! illustrious youth, Supreme in rank, in virtue still more high, Thy care continue to these orphan babes. She ceas'd, and speechless on her pillow sunk. Th' enamour'd Persian instant on the floor Dropp'd, like a stony mass, which inward throes Of earth convulsive from a cliff disjoins; Dead monument of ruin on the beach Immoveable it lies. Melissa calls On Haliartus; suddenly he bears The hapless youth, inanimate and cold, To an adjoining chamber. There outstretch'd, Restor'd to sense by kind, unwearied zeal In Haliartus, all the nÃ­ght he roam'd Through sad delirium's labyrinths till morn; When lo! Melissa: Comfort thee, she said, The princess lives; the burden from her mind Discharg'd, hath render'd to the pow'rs of life Exertion less confin'd, rekindling hope Of restoration. So th' all-ruling gods Vicissitude to nature have decreed; The mind, the body languishes to-day, Revives to morrow....Interrupting came Mardonius thus: What tidings have I heard Of Artamanes and the princess dead By malady most rare, a mutual flame Too long conceal'd? But ent'ring I receiv'd A milder tale; they live. Thou holy Greek! Employ thy science; save a lovely dame, Though Persian born; in him preserve my friend; Mardonius, long thy country's foe, to thee Win ne'er be hostile. To SandaucÃ¨ go, Say from my lips, and, Artamanes, hear, The flow'r of nobles Xerxes shall not lose Through disappointed passion; were my friend Less than he is, among the satraps least, At my enforcement shall the king unite Their nuptial hands. Now rouse thee, gallant youth, Not long thy gen'ral from his side can spare Thy worth approv'd. Masistius is remote; In virtue rich beyond a mortal's share, But to that virtue never yielding rest, He for a time on high adventure bent Hath left me; thou his vacant place must fill. The son of Gobryas to his tent returns. End of the Twentieth Book. VOL III BOOK the Twenty-first. Sev'n days were past, when Lamachus appear'd Before Mardonius. Mighty chief, he said, I hasted to Themistocles, and spoke Thy friendly words. His answer first imply'd No more, than cold acceptance of the terms For Mindarus. At length two hundred, prime, Of all his num'rous captives, he releas'd; His minister, Sicinus, in the ship, Which landed me, detains them near the port, Till Haliartus, and the promis'd gold Are lodg'd on board. Themistocles himself Was bound to Athens with his menial train, His wife and race. We parted on the shore. To me, repeating in a whisper'd tone Thy proffers large, he scornful thus reply'd: âThe spoils of Asia will exceed her gifts.â Then loud thy brave defiance I pronounc'd. He with redoubled arrogance thus brief: âRouse thy new master; else the plains of Thebes âI may attain before him.â Fir'd with rage Mardonious here: If Athens do not send By Alexander's mouth submission low, She shall become the spoil of Asian flames, Themistocles spectator of the blaze. Be swift; yon Greek for Mindarus exchange; Two hundred talents promis'd shall be paid; These ransom'd warriors I appoint my guard; Brave Mindarus their captain. Stern he ends; In open fight th' Athenian to confront Magnanimous he burns; his heated soul Yields to delusion of that subtle chief, Wise like the serpent gliding through a brake, When his empoison'd jaws in silence steal On some incautious woodman, who, on toil Intent, exerts his brawny strength, nor deems A foe is nigh, nor hears him, nor perceives, Till sore the death-inflicting wound he feels. A summons swift for embarkation flies To Haliartus. With regret he leaves Dear friends, but dearer his AcanthÃ¨'s love, More prevalent his constant zeal for Greece Combine to sooth his pain. They wing his speed To good Sicinus, who, the ransom'd train Discharging, tow'rds EubÅa steers the keel With Persian treasure fraught. The ev'ning clos'd, When by a hasty mandate to the son Of Gobryas, Lamachus was call'd. The chief In perturbation of indignant wrath Was striding o'er the carpet, which bespread His rich pavilion's floor. His words were these: The Macedonian king is just arriv'd From Athens; I have seen him. Dost thou know, That supercilious populace hath spurn'd My condescension, menac'd ev'n a prince, Their host, for proff'ring kindness in my name. Such my reward. To all th' Ionian Greeks, The seed of Athens, I, when victor, left Their democratic rule and laws unchang'd; But I will cut all freedom by the roots From man's ungrateful race. The wily Greek Insinuating fram'd this brief reply: Perhaps the name of Xerxes may offend Th' Athenian tribes. Might Europe once behold The son of Gobryas thron'd, then... Ha! proceed, Mardonius answer'd. Lamachus again: Doth not all Ãgypt, doth not Libya's clime, With Asia vast, afford redundant sway To gratify one monarch? First of men, Why may not Thrace, with Macedonia's realm, Thessalia, Greece, whate'er thy mighty arm Shall rend by conquest from the western world, Become thy prize? They willing might accept A sov'reign like Mardonius. Try their choice. AwayâMardonius spake; and frowning bade The Greek retire. Now left alone he mus'd, Thus questioning his heart: Aspiring thoughts, Do ye awaken at the coz'ning touch Of this vile tempter? Honour, while my ear Detests th' adviser, fortify my breast Against th' adviceâEnoughâMore swiftly drive, Dull night, thy sooty wheels; come, active morn, Then to the field, Mardonius. Conquer now; Deliberate hereafter on the spoil. But thou may'st perishâperish, and the gifts Of fortune change to everlasting fame. A sudden trumpet strikes his ear; he sees Masistius nigh. So breaks the polar star Through night's unrav'ling canopy of clouds On some bewilder'd sailor to correct His erring course. Amidst a warm embrace Began Mardonius: O, in season come, Thou more, than half myself! my strength decays, My talents languish, ev'n my honour sleeps, When thou art far. Masistius calm replies: I have compos'd Pallene's late revolt Through all the district; PotidÃ¦a's walls Alone resisted; from whose small domain O'erflow'd by tides the army I withdrew. I come, Mardonius, not to hear a tale Of languid talents, or of strength decay'd, Much less of honour sleeping in thy breast, When I am absent. Honour on a rock Immoveable is fix'd; its solid base The billowy passions beat in vain, nor gusts Of fortune shake; support from none it wants, Firm in itself. Some augury, or dream Inexplicably dark, o'erclouds thy mind; Resume thy native manliness, O chief, Whose loyal faith the mightiest king entrusts With all his pow'r and splendour, save the crown. Prepare to pass ThermopylÃ¦, and bring Our labours to decision. Gobryas' son Compares the language of his spotless friend With his own devious thoughts, and turns aside In blushing silence; but, recover'd, sends His mandate forth to march by rising dawn. Not with a less commotion in his soul From diff'rent cares Emathia's prince resorts To Amarantha. On her beauteous neck In conjugal affection, yet in grief Unutterable long he hangs. Alas! My lord, she said, though early I presag'd Thy embassy abortive, hath it prov'd Disastrous? Yes, her agonizing spouse Return'd; what more disastrous, than reproach Among the old, hereditary friends Of my forefathers! Amarantha, lend Attention; amply shall my tongue relate Events impress'd too deeply on my heart. I went to Athens; Aristides call'd Her various tribes; the image of a god Was he presiding. Innocent, at least Intentionally guiltless, I began; Good will to Athens prompted ev'ry word: Impow'r'd by Xerxes, thus Mardonius greets You, men of Athens. Repossess your soil, Enlarg'd dominion from the royal hand Ask and obtain; be govern'd by your laws; The son of Gobryas will rebuild your fanes; Accept the king's alliance, and be free With added strength and splendour. Me receive, Illustrious people, offspring of the soil Which you inhabit. Not a guest unknown In Athens, I, your Macedonian host, Of warm, unchang'd affection to your state, Salvation bring, prosperity, and peace. Reflect, what numbers of subjected Greeks, Some ancient foes to Athens, others friends, But now constrain'd, with Xerxes are ally'd. The small remainder unsubdu'd consult Their own defence. Are Spartans in the field? Your produce, indefatigable race, Your new-built mansions to a second waste Of flames, your wives, your progeny, they leave To want and rapine. Singly can you face Half Greece, all Asia, leagu'd against your weal? Oh! Amarantha, frowns on ev'ry brow Indignant lowr'd around me. Present there Was AÃ«mnestus from Laconia's state; He, who, unaw'd by Xerxes on his throne, Strange retribution claim'd, and sternly chose Mardonius' self the victim to appease Leonidas. Th' Athenians he address'd: âInvading Sardis to enlarge your sway, âAthenians, you are authors of a war, âWhich now extends to all of Grecian blood; âIll would it then become you to desert âThe gen'ral cause. To servitude resign'd âBy you, a double shame the Greeks would cast On Athens, known of old and often prov'd âBy arms and counsel to redeem and guard âThe liberty of nations. I condemn âLike you my tardy countrymen; will bleed âNot less for you, than Sparta. Soon, I trust, âShe will arrange her phalanx on the field; âElse to your vengeance I devote my head. âMeantime your wives and offspring ev'ry state âIn love will cherish. Attic ears, be shut âTo this deceiver; his condition calls âOn him to plead for tyranny; himself âWields a despotic scepter, petty lord âOf feeble Macedon, and Persia's slave.â Severe and awful Aristides rose; His manners still urbanity adorn'd: âAmbassador of Sparta,â he began, âUs thou hast charg'd as authors of the war, âYet dost extol our vigour in redress âOf injur'd states. Th' Ionians were enslav'd, âOur own descendants; Sardis we assail'd âTo set them free; nor less our present zeal âFor all of Grecian blood, by common ties âOf language, manners, customs, rites and laws âTo us ally'd. Can Sparta doubt our faith? âWhat disingenuous, unbeseeming thought âIn her, late witness of our lib'ral proof âOf constancy! when ev'ry clime on earth âWas equal to Athenians, where to chuse âTheir habitation, true to Greece they stay'd âIn sight of Athens burning to attempt âThe dang'rous fight, which Spartans would have âshunn'd. âNow from the ruins of paternal tombs, âOf altars fall'n, and violated fanes, âLoud vengeance calls, a voice our courage hears, âEnlarg'd to pious fury. Spartan, know, âIf yet unknowing, of the Attic race âNot one to treat with Xerxes will survive; âOur wives and offspring shall encumber none; âAll we require of Sparta is to march; âThat, ere th' expected foe invades our bounds, âThe Greeks united on BÅotian plains âMay give him battleâAlexander, view âThat glorious pow'r, which rolls above our heads; âHe first his wonted orbit shall forsake, âEre we our virtue. Never more appear âBefore the presence of Cecropian tribes âWith embassies like this; nor, blind by zeal, âHowe'er sincere to Athens, urge again âWhat is beneath her majesty to bear. âI should be griev'd her anger should disgrace âA prince, distinguish'd as her host and friend; âMeantime I pity thy dependent state.â Loud acclamations hurried from the sight Of that assembly thy dejected spouse, In his own thoughts dishonour'd. What a lot Is mine! If Xerxes triumph, I become A slave in purple; should the Greeks prevail, Should that EubÅan conqueror, the son Of Neocles be sent th' Athenian scourge.... Hear, and take comfort, interpos'd the queen. To thee I come for counsel, sigh'd her lord; I will repose me on thy breast, will hear Thy voice, hereafter ever will obey; Thy love, thy charms can sooth my plesent cares, Thy wisdom ward the future. She proceeds: That Greece will triumph, rest assur'd; no force Of these untaught Barbarians can resist Her policy and arms. Awhile, dear lord, We must submit to wear the galling mask Necessity imposes. New events Are daily scatter'd by the restless palm Of Fortune; some will prove propitious. Wife, To all men gracious, Aristides serv'd By us in season will befriend our state. This said, her star-like beauty gilds his gloom, While round them heav'n his midnight curtain drops. By rising dawn th' OetÃ¦an rocks and caves Ring with ten thousand trumps and clarions loud. With all his host the son of Gobryas leaves His empty'd camp. So rushes from his den The strong and thick-furr'd animal, who boasts Calisto's lineage; bound in drowsy sloth Bleak winter he exhausts; when tepid spring His limbs releases from benumbing cold, He reinstates his vigour, and asserts Among Sarmatian woods his wonted sway. The bands entire of Persians and of Medes, The rest, selected from unnumber'd climes, Compose the army. Forty myriads sweep Thy pass, renown'd ThermopylÃ¦, to rush On Grecian cities scatter'd in their view. So by the deep Borystenes in floods Of frothy rage, by mightier Danube's wave, Nor less by countless congregated streams, The Euxine swoln, through Hellespontine straits Impels his rapid current; thence extends Among th' Ãgean isles a turbid maze. Three days the multitude requir'd to pass The rough defile. Masistius in the van His sumptuous arms, and all-surpassing form Discovers. Tiridates leads the rear Clos'd by the troops of Macedon, whose king Sat on a car beside his radiant queen. Amid the center, on a milk-white steed, Mardonius rode in armour, plated gold Thick set with gems. Before him march'd a guard Of giant size, from each Barbarian tribe, For huge dimension, and terrific mien, Preferr'd. Their captain, from his stature nam'd Briareus, born on Rhodope, display'd That hundred-handed Titan on his shield. He swung around an iron-studded mace, In length ten cubits; to his shoulders broad The hairy spoils of hunted bears supply'd A shaggy mantle; his uncover'd head Was bald, except where nigh the brawny neck Short bushy locks their crisped terrors knit. So his own mountain through surrounding woods Lifts to the clouds a summit bare and smooth In frost, which glistens by no season thaw'd. Not such is gentle Mindarus behind In argent mail. Unceasing, on his shield Intent, Cleora newly painted there A living beauty, but another's prize, He views, while hopeless passion wastes the hue Of his fair cheek, and elegance of form. Not less th' unrivall'd Amarantha's eyes Had pierc'd the son of Gobryas. Instant sparks On her appearance from NicÃ¦a first Had kindled warm desire, which absence cool'd, While she in distant Macedon abode. When winter melted at the breath of spring, Her sight again amid th' assembling host Reviv'd the fervour of an eastern breast By nature prone, by wanton licence us'd, To am'rous pleasures. Public duty still Employ'd his hours; still smother'd was the flame, Nor on his wishes had occasion smil'd. Ev'n in the absence of Ãmathia's prince At Athens, friendship's unremitted care Still in SandaucÃ¨'s chamber held the queen Sequester'd, inaccessibly immur'd. Beside Masistius rode a youthful page Of eastern lineage. He in tend'rest years Stol'n by perfidious traffickers in slaves, By Medon purchas'd, to Melissa giv'n, By her was nam'd Statirus, and retain'd Among her holy servitors. This youth On her benign protector she bestow'd. Masistius priz'd her token of esteem Beyond himself, and daily bounty show'r'd On young Statirus. Near the Locrian vale Advancing now the satrap thus began: O! early train'd by sage Melissa's hand, Gift of her friendship, and in merit dear, Nine months are fled, Statirus, since I bow'd In docile reverence, not unlike thy own, To her instruction. All her words divine In precept or narration, from this breast No time can blot. I now perceive a lake, Which holds an island she hath oft describ'd, Where tombs are mould'ring under cypress shades; There she hath told me, great OÃ¯leus rests. O father of Melissa, should my pow'r To savage licence of invasion leave Thy dust expos'd, my progress were but small In virtue's track; Masistius would disgrace Thy daughter's guidanceâFly, Statirus, post These my attendant vassals to protect That sacred turf; let each battalion pass Ere ye rejoin me. Uttering this, he hears The trumpet's evening signal to encamp. The sun is low; not ent'ring yet the vale, Mardonius halts, and summons to his tent Thessialia's chieftain, faithless Greek, approv'd The Persian's friend, with him th' unwilling prince Of Macedon, to whom the gen'ral thus: To march by dawn your squadrons both prepare: Thou, LarissÃ¦an Thorax, in these tracts My trusted guide, with swift excursion reach The Isthmus; watch the Spartan motions there. Thou, Alexander, sweep the furthest bounds Of Locris, Doris, Phocis; all their youth In arms collect; ere thirty days elapse, I shall expect them on the plains of Thebes. He said: The king and Thorax both retire. The morning shines; they execute their charge; The host proceeds. Once happy was the vale, Where Medon's father, and his faithful swain, Now to illustrious Haliartus chang'd, Abode in peace. No longer is retain'd The verdant smoothness, ridg'd by grating wheels Of Libyan cars, uptorn by pond'rous hoofs Of trooping steeds and camels. Not this day Is festive, such as Sparta's king enjoy'd, When lib'ral hospitality receiv'd His guardian standard on the OÃ¯lean turf. No jocund swain now modulates his pipe To notes of welcome; not a maiden decks Her hair in flow'rs; mute Philomel, whose throat Once tun'd her warble to Laconian flutes, Amid barbarian dissonance repines. Now in rude march th' innumerable host Approach the fountain, whose translucent rills In murmur lull the passenger's repose On beds of moss, in that refreshing cell, To rural peace constructed by the friend Of man, OÃ¯leus. Thither to evade The noontide heat the son of Gobryas turns. Briareus, captain of his giant guard, Accosts him ent'ring: Image of the king, A list'ning ear to me thy servant lend; Thou goest to Thebes; far diff'rent is the track To Delphi. Shall that receptacle proud Of Grecian treasure, heap'd from earliest times, Yet rest unspoil'd? An earthquake, not the arms Of feeble Delphians, foil'd the first attempt; Not twice Parnassus will disjoint his frame. Let me the precious enterprize resume, Who neither dread the mountain, nor the god. Though not assenting, yet without reproof Mardonius looks, postponing his reply. Hence soon the rumour of a new attempt Against the Pythian oracle, the seat Of Amarantha's birth, alarms her soul. Massistius born to virtue, and refin'd By frequent converse with Melissa pure, The queen consults. Her instant he conveys Before his friend, to deprecate an act Of sacrilege so fatal once. The cell She enters. Like Anchises, when his flock On Ida's mount was folded, at the sight Of Venus, breaking on his midnight hut In all the radiance of celestial charms, Mardonius stands, and fixes on the queen An eye transported. At a sign his friend Withdrew, but waited nigh. To her the chief: What fortune brings the fairest of her sex To her adoring servant? She replies: False sure the rumour which pervades thy camp. A second time to violate the shrine Of PhÅbus once provok'd, and sorely felt, Thou canst not mean. The eager Persian then: Admit th' intent; thy interceding voice Protects Apollo. Not on my request Avoid an impious action, firm she spake; Weigh thy own danger in offending heav'n, By piety and mercy win its grace. No, all the merit shall be thine, he cried; The favour due from heav'n be all thy own. I ask no more than Amarantha's smile For my reward; as PhÅbus is thy god, Thou art my goddess. Let me worship thusâ He stop'd, and seiz'd her hand with am'rous lips To stain those lilied beauties, which surpass'd Junonian whiteness. Virtue from her eyes Flash'd, and with crimson indignation dy'd Her cheeks: Retire; forget not who I am, Stern she rebuk'd him. He, accustom'd long To yielding beauty in the wanton East, That torrid clime of love, a stranger he To elegance of coyness in the sex, Much more to chaste repulse, when ev'ry bar But honour warm occasion hath remov'd, These words austerely utter'd: Am I chang'd? No more Mardonius? Is my dazzling sun Of pow'r and splendour suddenly obscur'd? In state degraded, for a peasant's garb Have I exchang'd my purple? Is my prime, My form, in all th' impurities of age By some malignant talisman disguis'd, At once grown loathsome? Who, and what I am, Thou prodigy of coldness and disdain, Remind me. Who, and what thou art, she said, I will remind thee to confound thee more. No characters of magic have the pow'r To change a noble and ingenuous mind; Thou hast thyself degraded; thou hast rent The wreaths, which circle thy commanding brow, And all their splendour wantonly defac'd. Thy rank and pow'r exalted dost thou hold From partial heav'n to violate the laws Of men and gods? True pattern to the world Of Persian virtues! Now to all thy pomp, Thy steeds, thy chariots, and emblazing gems, The gorgeous pageants of tyrannic state, I leave thee, son of luxury and vice. She said, and darted like a meteor swift Away, whose aspect red presages woe To superstition's herd. The Persian's pride Is wounded; tapers to the cell he calls; By them a tablet, unobserv'd before, Attracts his gloomy eye. The words were these: âThe Spartan king a visitant was here, âWho, by a tyrant's multitude o'erpow'r'd, âDied for his country. Be accurst the man, âThe man impure, who violates these walls, âWhich, by OÃ¯leus hospitably rais'd, âReceiv'd the great Leonidas a guest. âOÃ¯lean Medon this inscription trac'd.â Another hangs beneath it in this strain: âLaconian AÃ«mnestus rested here, âFrom Asia's camp return'd. His faulchion's point âTo deities and mortals thus proclaims âHis arm to vengeance on Mardonius pledg'd, âThe king of Sparta's manes to appease.â Brave was the son of Gobryas, like the god Of war in battle; yet a dream, an act Of froward chance, would oft depress his mind. He recollects with pain the challenge bold From that severe Laconian in the tent Of Xerxes; this to Amarantha's scorn Succeeding, throws new darkness o'er his gloom. Masistius ent'ring hasty thus began: What hast thou done, Mardonius? When I led This princess back, indignant she complain'd Of wrong from thee. Thy countenance is griev'd. Confus'd, Mardonius pointed to the scrolls; Masistius read; he took the word again: Now in the name of Horomazes, chief, Art thou discourag'd by a Grecian vaunt, Or by that empty oracle which claim'd Atonement for Leonidas? Despise Mysterious words and omens like a man. But if thou bear'st the conscience of a deed Unworthy, just thy sorrow; like a man Feel due contrition, and the fault repair. I have meant wrong, not acted, said the chief. Greece once produc'd a Helen, who forsook A throne and husband; what these later dames Call honour, which without an eunuch guard Protects their charms, in Asia is unknown. Resentful, gall'd at first, I now admire This lofty woman, who, like Helen bright, Rejected me a lover, who surpass The son of Priam. Thou art gentler far Than I, discreet Masistius; sooth by morn With lenient words, and costly gifts, her ire. Call Mindarus, together let us feast; He too is gentle, I am rough and hot, Whom thou canst guide, Masistius, thou alone. Soon Mindarus appears in aspect sad; Soon is the royal equipage produc'd, Which Xerxes gave Mardonius to sustain His delegated state. Ye rustic pow'rs! Ye Dryads, Oreads of th' OÃ¯lean seat! Ye Naiads white of lucid brooks and founts! Had you existence other than in tales Of fancy, how had your astonish'd eyes At piles of gold enrich'd by orient gems Been dimm'd with lustre? Genius of the cell Simplicity had fram'd to rural peace! How hadst thou started at a Persian board? Fair female minstrels charm the sight and ear; Effeminating measures on their lutes Dissolve the soul in languor, which admits No thought but love. Their voices chance directs To sing of DaphnÃ¨ by Apollo chas'd, Of him inflam'd at beauties in her flight Disclos'd, him reaching with a vain embrace Those virgin beauties, into laurel chang'd On flowry-bank'd Orontes, Syrian stream. Mardonius sighs at disappointed love; Tears down the cheeks of Mindarus descend, Recalling dear Cleora, not as dead Recall'd, but living in another's arms. Not so the firmness of Masistius yields; The sost, lascivious theme his thoughts reject, By pure affections govern'd. Yet the charm Of harmony prevailing serves to raise Compos'd remembrance of Melissa's lyre, Which oft in stillness of a moon-light hour, Amid her nymphs in symphony high-ton'd, To moderation, equity, and faith, To deeds heroic and humane she struck With force divine, reproving lawless will, Intemp'rate passions, turpitude of mind, And savage manners in her ethic lay. The banquet ends, and all depart to rest. End of the Twenty-first Book. BOOK the Twenty-second. By morn return'd Masistius: Hear, he said, Th' event unpleasing from thy passion sprung. Mardonius, thy temerity hath chac'd From Persia's camp the Macedonian queen; I found her tent abandon'd; but her course Conjecture cannot trace. What other style Than of Barbarians can the Greeks afford To us of Asia? Lo! a youthful king, Our best ally, and my distinguish'd friend, Exerts a distant effort in our cause, Meantime the honour of his queen, by all Ador'd, inviolate till now, our chief Insults, by station her protector sole, When I am absent. Not thyself alone Thou hast disgrac'd, but me her guardian pledg'd By sacred oaths to Macedonia's lord. These words, evincing nature's purest gifts, Deserving that society sublime With Grecian muses, where Melissa pour'd Her moral strain, in perturbation plunge The hearer; when importunate, abrupt Appears Briareus, and renews the suit To pillage Delphi. No, in wrath replied The clouded son of Gobryas; bring my steed; March all to Thebes. Then humble as a child, Who to parental castigation owns His fault in tears, Masistius he address'd: How bless'd the mind by Horomazes fram'd Like thine, serene Masistius, to resist Unruly passions! never warm desires, Pride, or ambition, vex thy equal thoughts, Which from their level no dejection low'rs; Yet none surpasses thee in rank and pow'r Among the satraps. Uncorrupted man! O, in thyself superior to thy state, Me, who so often sink below my own, Befriend in this dark moment. I foresee, I feel disaster in this harsh event. Masistius here: Reflect, thou mighty chief, At either gate of life, the first and last, Yet more through all their intermediate space, Vicissitude and hazard lurk unseen, Supplanting wary steps. To mortal pow'r Those dreadful ministers of jealous heav'n, The elements, are hostile, and to low'r The great with changing fortune oft conspire. Her cruel sport, Mardonius, need we tempt With our own follies? In thy arduous post Thy hand sustains a balance, where the lives Of nations, where an empire's fate is pois'd From hour to hour against the common ills Of chance and nature, which so often foil The wisest; do not super-add the weight Of thy own passions to the adverse scale. I, who am ever to thy virtues just, Will not be slow, though grieving at thy faults, To furnish present help. Farewell; I mount My swiftest courser to o'ertake the queen, Whose indignation I can best compose. Mardonius then: Adventure is a chace Thy virtue, no idolatress of fame, Enjoys; thy prompters are the love of right, Care for a friend, or zeal for Persia's state, Which render hazardous attempts thy bliss, Sublime Masistius. Thou hast weight to awe Mardonius, who thy enterprising hand Laments, but never to controul assumes, Yet feels and most regrets his own defects, Whene'er they cause thy absence. Here they end Discourse. Of cavalry a num'rous pow'r, Train'd by himself, Masistius heads, and leaves The army filing tow'rds BÅotian fields. He bends his course to Delphi; he attains Permessus, round the Heliconian heights In argent mazes whisp'ring, as he flows, To passengers along the winding way, Which skirts the mountain, and o'erlooks the stream. Back from the ford the satrap's courser starts Affrighted. Lo! to crimson, as of blood, In sudden change the late crystalline wave, Melodious solace of the sacred nine, Rolls horrible to view. Anon with helms, With spears and bucklers, grating o'er the bed Of loosen'd stone, with limbs and trunks of men, The turbid current chafes. Masistius spurs Through all obstruction; in his forc'd career The clank of armour, crash of spears, and shouts Of battle strike his ear; the vocal rocks Augment the animating sound; he sees A flying soldier, by his target known A Macedonian guard, who stops, and thus: Hail! satrap, hail! thou timely sent by heav'n, Haste and protect the Macedonian queen. A host of robbers, by the lawless times Combin'd, have vanquish'd our inferior force; Part of our mangled number choak that flood, Part on the ground lie bleeding. At these words Masistius rushes with his pond'rous lance In rest; Emathia's beauteous queen in flight Before pursuing ruffians he perceives On her fleet courser. Thunderbolt of strength, He hurls to earth their leader giant-siz'd, A profligate deserter from the guard Mardonian. Next a Phocian born, expell'd His native residence for crimes, he slew; The active staff is broken in the chest Of an Arcadian, branded by his state With infamy; the victor then unsheaths His sabre, op'ning through the savage rout A passage wide for death. His faithful train Surround them; irresistible he sweeps The traitors headlong to the flood below, Which foams like Simois, by Pelides swoln With Trojan dead, and struggling to discharge Th' unwonted load in Neptune's briny waste. The conqueror dismounts; before the queen His gracious form presenting, in the arms Of his sustaining friends he sudden sinks, Oppress'd by wounds unheeded, ev'n unfelt Amid the warmth of action. Then her veil She rends asunder, and, lamenting, beats Her grateful breast. The notes of sorrow, loud Through all the concourse, dissipate his trance. Serene these words he utters: Honour's track Is perilous, though lovely; there to walk, Not fearing death, nor coveting his stroke, Though to receive it ever well prepar'd, Has been my choice and study. But, fair queen, Be not discourag'd at my present state, Wounds are to me familiar, and their cures; To Delphi lead me, or whatever place, Thy wish prefers. Masistius comes thy guard, So will continue, and, ere long restor'd, Hath much for thy instruction to impart. While these to Delphi, on his march to Thebes Advanc'd the son of Gobryas. Soon the steps Innumerous of men and coursers bruise On green Cephissian meads the growth of May. CopÃ¦Ã¦'s lake, perfum'd with orange groves, Which rude unsated violence deforms, The multitudes envelop; thence along The sedgy borders of Ismenus reach Cadm?an walls, when now the golden sun Sev'n times had fill'd his orbit. Thebes admits The Persian gen'ral, in these words address'd By Leontiades: Thrice welcome, lord, We, thy allies, our counsel to disclose Have waited long. Not hazarding a fight, Thou hast the means to ascertain success. Here seated tranquil, from exhaustless stores Distribute gold among the Grecian states; Corrupt the pow'rful, open faction's mouth, Divide, nor doubt to overcome that strength, Which, link'd in union, will surmount the force Of all mankind. The ardent Persian here: To court th' Athenians with a lavish hand Have I not stoop'd already? but, disdain'd, That haughty race to destiny I leave. Have I not bid defiance to their boast, Themistocles? Him, forfeiting his word, Pledg'd to confront me on BÅotian plains, I haste to summon at his native gates. What are the Greeks, if Athens be reduc'd? Where are the vaunted Spartans? lock'd in fear Behind their isthmian wall, by heav'n in fear Of Thorax ranging with a slender band Of his Thessalian horse. Thou rule in Thebes, Brave Mindarus, till I from Athens tam'd Return with fetters for the rest of Greece. He seeks his couch, and, after short repose, By twilight bursts like thunder from a cloud, Which, on Olympus hov'ring black, contains The livid store of Jove's collected wrath Against offending mortals. O'er a land Deserted, silent, to the empty roofs Of Athens was the march. Mardonius climb'd Ãgaleos, thence on Salamis descry'd That much-enduring people, who again For liberty forsook their native homes On his approach. His gen'rous pride relents; He wishes such a nation were a friend; His wishes waken in his breast an awe At such a foe. Murichides was nigh, A Hellespontine Grecian of his train, Nor in his favour low; to him he spake: Look on that haughty, but that gallant race; Perhaps at me, by myriads thus begirt, Their very children lift their little hands In menaces, and cursing lisp the names Of Xerxes and Mardonius. Mount a bark; Pass with a herald to that crowded isle; The senators accost; the people shun, In pride beyond nobility; repeat The words Ãmathian Alexander us'd: âYe men of Athens, repossess your homes; âEnlarg'd dominion from the royal hand âAsk and obtain; be govern'd by your laws; âThe son of Gobryas will rebuild your fanes; âAccept the king's alliance, and be free âWith added strength and splendour.â Further say, They little know what confidence is due To him who sends thee. Asian Greeks, subdu'd By me, retain their democratic rights. On Salamis the Hellespontine lands; Before th' Athenian senate he displays The Persian proffer. All indignant hear But Lycides, who thus exhorting spake: From Athens twice expell'd, deserted twice By LacedÃ¦mon, who her toil employs Still on her isthmian fence, who lifts no shield To guard our wives and progeny, to save From desolation our defenceless fields, Or from our homes repel the hostile blaze, What can we better, injur'd and betray'd, Than listen to Mardonius? be referr'd His terms of friendship to th' assembling tribes. The universal senate rose in scorn Of such submission. By the people known, His counsel rous'd enthusiastic rage, Nor Aristides can the tumult cool; They stone the timid senator to death. The women catch the spirit; fierce, as fair, Laodice collects th' infuriate sex. They hand in hand a dreadful circle form Around his mansion, and his wife and race Doom to perdition, that his coward blood May ne'er survive in Greece. Enormous thought! Perhaps not less than such excess of zeal Excess of peril in that season claim'd To save a land, which foster'd ev'ry muse; That eloquence, philosophy and arts Might shine in Attic purity of light To latest ages: but a sudden fleet, In wide array extending on the shore, Suspends the deed. Before each wond'ring eye Timothea lands, Sicinus at her side; When thus the matron to th' impatient throng: His native friends Themistocles salutes: EubÅan plenty in your present need He sends. Returning, I this crouded isle Will disencumber, and to safety bear Your wives and infants; open to their wants Eudora holds her Amarynthian seat; Elephenor, Tisander to the shrines Of Jove invite them, and to friendly roofs EubÅa's towns. As oft Aurora sheds Serenity around her, when the gates Of light first open to her fragrant step; Hush'd at her feet lies Boreas, who had rent The dusky pall of night, and Jove restrains The thunder's roar, and torrents of the skies; Such was Timothea's presence, so the storm, By furies late excited, at her voice Was tame. She learns the melancholy fate Of Lycides, to her protection takes His helpless orphans, and disastrous wife. Now of its plenteous stores while eager hands The num'rous fleet unlade, and Attic dames Prepare with good Timothea to embark; Just Aristides, first of men, conducts That first of matrons to his joyful tent, Where she began: O righteous like the gods, Now hear my whole commission, and believe Themistocles, my husband, feels thy worth. When at his summons on EubÅa's coast I landed first, âThrice welcome,â he exclaim'd, âFrom Athens hither to a safe abode. âA second emigration I presage âTo her afflicted race.â From port to port Around EubÅa's populous extent With him convey'd, I saw her wealthy towns To his controul subordinate. Their pow'rs He now is gath'ring; some achievement new He meditates, which secresy conceals Like fate's dark roll inscrutable to all. From thee an early notice he requests, Soon as the Greeks, united in one camp, The sole attention of Mardonius draw; Th' intelligence to bring I leave behind That faithful man, Sicinus. Virtuous dame, Wise is thy husband, Aristides spake; From him no other than achievements high, However my conjecture they surpass, I still expect. Themistocles apprise, That I am bound for Sparta to upbraid Pausanias proud, and summon to the field That selfish breed so martial, yet so cold To public welfare. Let me next prefer To thy benignity a fervent suit. He straight withdrew, and reappearing led Two little damsels humble in attire. Behold my daughters, he resum'd; admit These to thy care; now motherless they want Protection; ev'n Euphemia they have lost; My venerable parent have the gods Releas'd but newly from the growing scene Of trouble. Athens must a parent prove To these hereafter, fated to receive No portion from a father, who delights In poverty. His arms are all the wealth Of Aristides. With a tender hand She takes the children: O! of men, she said, Most rich, whose wealth is virtue, in the name Of household gods this office I accept. O Aristides! these shall mix with mine; These shall contribute to cement the work, I long have wrought, the amity begun Betwixt Themistocles and thee. In tears Depart the infant maidens from a sire Of gentlest nature, and in manners bland Not less, than just. Meanwhile to Athens steers Murichides unharm'd. The rising dawn Sees with her precious charge Timothea sail. Lo! from the city clouds of smoke ascend Voluminous, with interlacing flames, Such as Vesuvius vomits from his gulph Sulphureous, when unquenchable the heat Within his concave melts the surging ore To floods of fire. Murichides had told His fruitless embassy; Mardonius, wild With ire, to instant conflagration doom'd Th' abode of such inexorable foes. They, on the margin opposite, beheld Their ancient residence a second time Destroy'd; nor utter'd more than just complaint Of tardy Sparta. When Briareus dire With his gigantic savages o'erturn'd The recent tomb, which held the glorious slain At Salamis; when scatter'd in the wind They saw that dust rever'd; in solemn rage, Devoid of sound illiberal, or loud, Each his right hand with sanctity of oaths Pledg'd to his neighbour, and to vengeance full His blood devoted. Aristides look'd, As some incens'd divinity, and spake: Persist, ye sons of folly; crush that tomb; The last repose of yon heroic slain Disturb, therein exhibiting your doom From mortals, and immortals. Thus your pride By heav'n, and Grecian valour, shall be crush'd, Your impious host be scatter'd like that dust Which your barbarity profanes. Now, friends, By your appointment I to Sparta sail; You under watchful discipline remain Compos'd and firm; such patience will surmount All obstacle, Athenians; will restore In brighter glories your paternal seats. This said, the isle he leaves, selecting none, But Cimon for associate. In the bark Him Aristides placidly bespake: Son of Miltiades the great in arms, Thy early youth was dissolute; thy look Ingenuous still, and frank thy tongue, reveal'd Internal virtue; friendship on my part Succeeded, thence a study to reclaim Thy human frailties. I rejoice in hope, Thou wilt hereafter prove an Attic star, In council wise, triumphant in the field, Humane to strangers, to thy country just, Friend to her laws, to all her Muses kind, Who may record thy actions. Cimon here: If I have virtues, they proceed from thee; If I attain to glory, I shall owe To thee my lustre. To deserve thy praise, What have I yet accomplish'd? I have fought At Salamis, what more performing there Than each Athenian? Aristides then: True, all were brave; my judgment doth not rest On one exploit; thy modesty o'erlooks The signs of worth and talents, whence my hopes Have rank'd thee first of Grecians. To acquire, To keep that station, Cimon, be thy choice; Thou hast the means; but this impression hold, Who would excel, must be a moral man. Thus they exhaust their voyage of a day, When at TrÅzenÃ¨ they arrive, and find Renown'd Cleander training for the field His native bands. To Sparta thence they sail. The Ephori assemble, when they hear Of Aristides, who an audience claims; He comes before them, and austerely thus: Cecropia's race, exterminated twice, Demand of Sparta, whether sloth, or fear, Or Persian gold her buckler hath unbrac'd. Mardonius proffer'd more than equal terms, Not friendship singly, but enlarg'd domain To Athens, who to eleutherian Jove, To Greece was faithful, and the lib'ral gift Disdain'd. Your own ambassador pronounc'd Your phalanx ready; for its speedy march His head he pledg'd. Mardonius takes the field, He lays th' Athenian territory waste; Where are the Spartans? Adding work to work For their own sep'rate safety at their wall, Inglorious isthmian wall, while half the Greeks Become your foes, and Athens is betray'd. Pausanias present proudly thus replied: Hast thou not heard, the Hyacinthian rites Employ the Spartans? shall the heads of Greece Be question'd, be directed when to act By you Athenians? your inferior state May wait our leisure. Aristides here: Talk'st thou to me of Hyacinthian games, While rude Barbarians riot in our fields, While Athens burns, while sacrilege invades Our temples, while our ancestors we see Torn from the grave? Pausanias, thou disgrace To thy forefather Hercules, whose arm, To friends a bulwark, was a scourge to foes, What hast thou said? But, guardian to the son Of that renown'd Leonidas, who fought Beyond the isthmus, and for Greece expir'd, If thou retain'st no rev'rence for his blood, If thou dost scorn Lycurgus and his laws, If holding liberty an empty name, Art now in treaty with a lawless king, No more of words. Athenians have their choice To treat with Xerxes, or to distant climes Expand the sail, resigning to their fate Unfaithful, timid Grecians, who have lost All claim to succourâYet assume your swords! My love for Greece solicits you in tears. Be thou, Pausanias, general of all; We in that noble warfare will refuse No hardshipâEv'n thy arrogant command I like the meanest soldier will abide. Then AÃ«mnestus brief: O righteous man, I feel thy wrongs; Laconia's shame I feel, Which if delay still blackens, thou shalt lead Me, the due victim of Athenian wrath, Before those injur'd tribes, by me deceiv'd; Where my own sword shall sacrifice the blood, I pledg'd for Sparta's faith. Meantime withdraw; I was thy guest in Athens, thou be mine. Not till the day-spring AÃ«mnestus greets His Attic friend: Our citizens are march'd; All night my indefatigable toil Hath urg'd the phalanx on; the various states Within the isthmus will obey our call; Now speed with me, o'ertake, inspect our host. They both depart with Cimon. Sparta's camp, Ere PhÅbus couches, Aristides gains; The marshall'd pupils of Lycurgus there He, ever true to equity, applauds, Who their disgraceful sloth in council blam'd. Subordination, silent order held Each in his place; in look, as virgins, meek, Sedate they listen'd to their chiefs, as youth To learning's voice in academic schools. Thus in some fertile garden well-manur'd, The regularity of plants and trees Enrich'd with produce, on a stable root Stands permanent, by skilful care dispos'd At first, and sedulously watch'd. No vaunt Offends the ear, nor supercilious frown Of confidence the eye. Th' Athenian chief Content returns; on Salamis receiv'd, Cecropia's bands he marshals for the field. The ravage still of Attica detain'd Mardonius. Thorax of Larissa quits His isthmian station; rapid in his course To Gobryas' son these tidings he imparts: The isle of Pelops musters all her pow'rs; The isthmus swarms; forsake this rocky land For cavalry unfit; collect thy force To face the Grecians on Cadm?an plains. Her sleepy sword at last has Sparta rous'd, Replies Mardonius? On Cadmean plains The Persian trump shall sound; CithÃ¦ron's hill, Asopian banks, shall soon repeat the notes Triumphal. Swift he rushes back to Thebes, Ere PhÅbus darted his solstitial heat. As some hot courser, who from pasture led Replete with food and courage, spurns the ground In confidence and pride, no sooner meets His wonted rider, than admits the rein; Such was Mardonius, when from Theban gates Masistius thus address'd him: Be inform'd, That Macedonia's sov'reign is arriv'd, With his fair consort. Her to Delphi's walls I guarded, there deliver'd to her lord, Who hath conducted fifty thousand Greeks In arms, auxiliar to thy camp. The queen, Now at a fabric old, to DircÃ¨ built, Close by her fountain, and beset with shade, Dwells in retreat, which careful thou avoid. But tell me, son of Gobryas, whither flown Was all thy magnanimity, when flames A second time laid stately Athens low? Though disappointed, couldst thou deem a crime Her constancy, refusing to betray A common cause? Mardonius, thou dost hope To conquer; why a city of renown, Which in her beauty would have grac'd our sway, Hast thou reduc'd to ashes? Oh! reflect, What fires of stern resistance and revenge This act hath lighted in such gallant hearts. That pow'r eternal, by the hallow'd name Of Horomazes worshipp'd in our clime, Who earth and seas and firmament controuls, With all therein, looks down not less on Greece, Than Persia, both his creatures. Just and wise, Intemp'rate deeds in either he resents. Mardonius answer'd: By that pow'r I swear, Thou to a Grecian almost art transform'd By intercourse with yon religious hill Of thy admir'd Melissa. Do I blame? Ah! no; too awful art thou to incur My censure. O Masistius, I confess Thy genius purer, more sublime, than mine; I often err, thou neverâBut, dear friend, I am dejected ever when thou chid'st; Yet thee, my chiding monitor, should fate Snatch from Mardonius, he would rise no more. I only seek to warn thee, not deject, Rejoins Masistius; turn to other cares; Greece is in arms; address thee to thy charge. This said, to council they in Thebes proceed. End of the Twenty-second Book. BOOK the Twenty-third. The Heliconian records now unfold, CalliopÃ¨! harmonious thence recite The names and numbers of the various Greeks, Who in array on fair BÅotian plains, With gleams of armour streak the twinkling wave Of clear Asopus. TrÅzen known to fame, Where Pittheus dwelt, whose blood to Athens gave The hero Theseus, TrÅzen from her walls In circuit small, from Hylycus her stream, From her ScyllÃ¦an promontory high, From vine-attir'd MethenÃ¨, from the isles, Calauria, Neptune's seat, and SphÃ¦ria dear To Pallas, daughter of almighty Jove, Two thousand warriors sends. Cleander pass'd The isthmus first; who manly, from the bed Of Ariphilia nising, vow'd to deck Her future cradle with a victor's wreath Of laurel new. Her beauteous image grac'd His four-fold buckler. Twice eight hundred youths From Ãsculapian Epidaurus march'd, From mount Cynortius, and the sacred hill, Titth?on, where the mother of that god Medicinal in secret left her fruit Of stolen enjoyment in Apollo's arms; Where in serenity of smiles was found The sweet PhÅbean child, while lambent flames Play'd round his temples. Clitophon the chief, A serpent green, the symbol of his god, Bore on his silver shield. Four hundred left Lepr?um, clear ArenÃ¨, and th' impure Anigrian waters, where the centaur, fell Polenor, wounded by Herculean shafts, Dipp'd in the blood of Hydra, purg'd his limbs From putrid gore, envenoming the stream; Their leader Conon. Of MycenÃ¦ old, Of Tiryns, built by fam'd Cyclopian toil, Eight hundred shields Polydamas commands. Two thousand gallant youths, with standards bless'd At Hebe's altar, tutelary pow'r Of Phlius, bold Menander led to war. Himself was young; the blooming goddess shone Bright on his buckler. Under Lycus brave HermionÃ¨, fair city, had enroll'd Six hundred spears. The impress on his shield Was strong Alcides, dragging from the gates Of Dis their latrant guardian triple-mouth'd Through an abyss in Hermionean land, The fabled wonder of the district shewn. Three thousand sail'd from Cephalenia's isle, From Acarnanian, and Epirot shores, With various chieftains. Of Arcadian breed Orchomenus twelve hundred, Tegea sent Three thousand. Chileus, prime in Tegea's camp, Was skill'd in arms, and vaunted high the name, The rank and prowess of his native state. Ten thousand helms from wealthy Corinth's walls Blaze o'er the champaign; these AlcmÃ¦on leads With Adimantus. Neighb'ring Sicyon arm'd Six thousand more; amidst whose splendid files Automedon commanded. Lo! in air A mighty banner! from the hollows green, The wood-crown'd hills in LacedÃ¦mon's rule, Taijgetus, and Menelaian ridge, From Crocean quarries, from Gyth?um's port, TherapnÃ¨, sweet AmyclÃ¦ on the banks Of fam'd Eurotas, from a hundred towns, A glitt'ring myriad of Laconians shew Their just arrangement. Aemnestus there Lifts his tall spear, and rises o'er his ranks In arduous plumes and stature. So the strength And stately foliage of a full-grown oak O'erlooks the undershades, his knotted arms Above their tops extending. Mightier still Callicrates appears, in martial deeds Surpassing ev'ry Grecian. He his fate Foresees not; he, capricious fortune's mark, Must fall untimely, and his gen'rous blood Unprofitably shed. A firmer band Succeeds. Huge Sparta, who forever scorn'd Defensive walls and battlements, supplied Five thousand citizens close-mail'd; a train Of sev'n bold Helots exercis'd in arms, Attend each warrior; there Pausanias tow'r'd. In pride the son of Atreus he surpass'd Without his virtues, a superior host Commanding. Never Greece such heroes sent, Nor such a pow'r in multitude to war; For landed recent on the neighb'ring shore Th' Athenian phalanx opens broad in sight Their eleutherian banner. They advance Eight thousand men at arms; an equal force In archers, slingers, missile-weapon'd sons Of terror follow. Round her naval flag Already four bold myriads from her loins Had Attica enroll'd. What chiefs preside! Themistocles, Xanthippus in remote, But glorious action; Aristides here, Myronides and Cimon, Clinias, sire Of Alcibiades, the warrior bard, Young Pericles, and more than time hath seen Since or before, in arts and arms renown'd. The ancient foe of Athens, yet averse Like her to Xerxes, Megara enroll'd Six thousand warriors. From Ãgina sail'd A thousand. Twice six hundred, PhÅnix-like, Sprung from the ashes of PlatÃ¦a burnt, With Arimnestus march'd, th' intrepid friend Of him, whose deeds ThermopylÃ¦ resounds, Diomedon. From Thespia, who had shar'd PlatÃ¦a's doom, two thousand came unarm'd, Unclad, a want by Attic stores supplied. Alcimedon was chief, of kindred blood To Dithyrambus; whom, his early bloom For Greece devoting, on Melissa's hill The Muses sing and weep. Between the roots Of tall CithÃ¦ron, and th' Asopian floods, The army rang'd. The Spartans on the right One wing compos'd; the men of Tegea claim'd The left in pref'rence to th' Athenian host. Contention rose; Pausanias sat the judge, Callicrates and Aemnestus wise, His two assessors; thick Laconian ranks A circle form; when Chileus thus asserts The claim of Tegea: Spartans, from the time, The early time, that Echemus, our king, In single combat on the listed field O'erthrew the invader Hyllus, and preserv'd Unspoil'd the land of Pelops, we obtain'd From all her sons unanimous this post, Whene'er united in a common cause They march'd to battle. Not with you we strive, Ye men of Sparta, at your choice command In either wing; the other we reclaim From Athens; brave and prosp'rous we have join'd Our banners oft with yours; our deeds you know; To ours superior what can Athens plead Of recent date, or ancient? for what cause Should we our just prerogative resign? Then Aristides spake: Collected here Are half the Grecians to contend in arms With Barbarous invaders, not in words Each with the other for precedence vain. From his own volume let the tongue of time, Not mine, proclaim my countrymen's exploits In early ages. In his course he views The varying face of nature, sea to land, Land turn'd to sea, proud cities sink in dust, The low exalted, men and manners change, From fathers brave degen'rate sons proceed, And virtuous children from ignoble sires. What we are now, you, Grecians, must decide At this important crisis. Judges, fix On Marathon your thoughts, that recent stage Of preservation to the public weal, Where fifty nations, arm'd to conquer Greece, We unassisted foil'd; more fresh, the day Of Salamis recall. Enough of words; No more contention for the name of rank; The bravest stand the foremost in the sight Of gods and mortals. As to you is meet, Determine, Spartans; at your will arrange Th' Athenians; they acknowledge you the chiefs Of this great league, for gen'ral safety fram'd, Wherever plac'd, obedient they will fight. The sense of all his countrymen he breath'd, Who for the public welfare in this hour Their all relinquish, and their very pride A victim yield to virtue. From his seat, Inspir'd by justice, Aemnestus rose: Brave as they are, our friends of Tegea seem To have forgot the Marathonian field, The Salaminian trophies; else this strife Had ne'er alarm'd the congregated host Of states so various and remote. As brief Callicrates subjoins: Not less our friends Of Tegea seem forgetful, that their claim Within the isthmus is confin'd, the gift Of part, not binding universal Greece. Athenian moderation had before Won ev'ry Spartan; loud they sound the name Of Athens, Athens, whose pretension just The general confirms, restoring peace. So in a chorus full the manly bass Directs the pow'r of harmony to float On equal pinions, and attune the air. Now Sparta's wide encampment on the right Was form'd; sedate and silent was the toil, As is the concourse of industrious ants, In mute attention to their public cares. Extending thence, successive states erect Their standards. On the left their num'rous tents Th' Athenians pitch. In labour not unlike The buzzing tenants of sonorous hives, Loquacious they and lively cheer the field, Yet regularly heed each signal giv'n By staid commanders. Underneath a fringe Of wood, projecting from CithÃ¦ron's side, Ascends the chief pavilion. Seated there Is Aristides at a frugal board, An aged menial his attendant sole; But from the tribes selected, round him watch An hundred youths, whose captain is the son Of fam'd Miltiades. The neighb'ring bed Of pure Asopus, from CithÃ¦ron's founts, Refreshment inexhaustible contain'd. His arms th' Athenian patriot in his tent Was now exploring, when he hears the step Of Aemnestus ent'ring, who began: Most wise of men and righteous, whom all Greece, Not Athens singly, as her glory claims, Grant me an hour. Laconian laws, thou know'st, Subordination to excess enjoin. I am obedient to the man, who holds Supreme command by office, rank, and birth, While thee my heart confesses and admits My sole adviser. Haughty and morose, O'er uncommunicated thoughts will brood Our dark Pausanias; I may often want Thy counsel; now instruct me. Is it meet, We cross th' Asopus to assail the foe, Or wait his coming? Let him come, replies The Attic sage; let bold invaders court A battle, not th' invaded, who must watch Occasion's favour. Present in thy mind Retain, that Greece is center'd in this host, Which if we hazard lightly were a crime, Th' offended gods with fetters would chastise: Our Attic flame to sudden onset points, By me discourag'd. Aemnestus then: Know, that with me Callicrates unites; Farewell; thy wisdom shall direct us both. The sun was set; th' unnumber'd eyes of heav'n Thin clouds envelop'd; dusky was the veil Of night, not sable; placid was the air; The low-ton'd current of Asopus held No other motion than his native flow, Alluring Aristides in a walk Contemplative to pace the stable verge Attir'd in moss. The hostile camp he views, Which by Masistian vigilance and art With walls of wood and turrets was secur'd. For this the groves of Jupiter supreme On Hypatus were spoil'd, Teumessian brows, Mesabius, Parnes, were uncover'd all. Square was th' inclosure, ev'ry face emblaz'd With order'd lights. Each elevated tent Of princely satraps, and, surmounting all, Mardonius, thine, from coronets of lamps Shot lustre, soft'ning on the distant edge Of wide PlatÃ¦an fields. A din confus'd Proclaim'd Barbarians; silent was the camp Of Greece. These thoughts the spectacle excites In Aristides: Slender is thy bound, Asopus, long to separate such hosts, Or keep thy silver wave from blood unstain'd. Lord of Olympus! didst thou want the pow'r, Or, boundless pow'r possessing, want the will Thy own created system to secure From such destruction? Wherefore on this plain Is Europe thus, and adverse Asia met For human carnage? Natural this search, Yet but a waste of reason. Let me shun Unprofitable wand'rings o'er the land Obscure of trackless mystery; to see The path of virtue open is enough. Whate'er the cause of evil, he, who knows Himself not partner in that cause, attains Enough of knowledge; all the rest is dream Of falsely-styl'd philosophy. My task Is to destroy the enemies of Greece; Be active there, my faculties, and lose Nor time, nor thought. Revisiting his tent, Sicinus call'd apart he thus instructs: Return, discreet and faithful, to the son Of Neocles; thy own observing eye Will prompt thy tongue; this notice sole I send. We will not hurry to a gen'ral fight. Bless in my name Timothea; bless her sons, Her daughters; nor, good man, o'erlook my own. Six monthly periods of the solar course Were now complete; intense the summer glow'd. The patient Greeks for eight successive days Endure the insults of Barbarian horse Behind their lines; when eager to his friend The Persian gen'ral: Best belov'd of men, Impart thy counsel. Lo! this vaunted race Lurk in their trenches, and avoid the plain. To him Masistius: I have mark'd a post Accessible and feeble in their line. To me thy choicest cavalry commit, I at the hazard of my life will gall, Perhaps may force that quarter. Ah! my friend, Mardonius answer'd, shall thy precious life Be hazarded? let others take the charge, Briareus, Midias, Tiridates brave, Or Mindarus; a thousand leaders bold This host affords. Masistius, in the gloom Of midnight from my pillow I discern'd Thy gracious figure on a steed of fire; Who bore thee up to heav'n, where sudden folds Of radiant vapour wrapp'd thee from my view. At once throughout th' innumerable tents Their hue was chang'd to black; BÅotia's hills And caves with ejulation from the camp Rebellow'd round; the camels, horses, mules, Dissolv'd in tears. Let Mithra's angry beam Pierce this right arm, annihilate my strength, And melt my courage! I will rest content To purchase thus the safety of my friend. Masistius answer'd: Son of Gobryas, learn, That he, who makes familiar to his mind The certainty of death, and nobly dares In virtue's clear pursuit, may look serene On boding dreams, and auguries averse. No sign, but honour, he requires; he wants No monitor, but duty. An attempt, My observation hath maturely weigh'd, Belongs to me; to others less inform'd I will not leave the danger. Quick replies Disturb'd Mardonius, while at friendship's warmth Ambition melts, and honour fills his breast: O! worthier far than frail Mardonius, take O'er all the host of Xerxes chief command; Me from temptation, him from danger guard. Again Masistius: Son of Gobryas, peace; My ear is wounded. Ever dost thou sink Below the level of thy worth with me, With others soar'st too high. What means the word Temptation? what this danger to the king? O satrap! listed by his grace so high, Thou hast o'erwhelm'd Masistius. May the God Of truth and justice strengthen in thy soul The light ingenuous, which so much reveals; That sense of duty may suppress a thought, I dare not clothe in language. Still in mind The parting words of Artemisia bear, Which in its blameless moments oft thy tongue Repeats with admiration. âLook,â she said, âLook only, where no mystery can lurk, âOn ev'ry manly duty. Nothing dark âO'ershades the track of virtue; plain her path; âBut superstition, chosen for a guide, âMisleads the best and wisest.â Let me add, Worse is the guide ambition, which misleads To more than error, to atrocious acts. I shall despair, Masistius, if thou fall'st, Rejoins Mardonius. Must Masistius then Consort with women, shut from noble deeds, Subjoins the virtuous Persian? Can thy hand, Thy friendly hand, now rivetted in mine, Of my degree, and dignity of birth Deprive me, or obliterate the name With all its lustre, which my fathers left Me to uphold? Or wouldst thou, if impow'r'd, Taint my firm spirit with an eunuch's fear, Among their feeble train my rank confine, My strength unnerve, my fortitude debase? While these subsist with titles, wealth and state, While, as I pass, the crouding myriads shout, Here comes Masistius; what is less requir'd From him, than deeds to manifest a soul, Which merits such distinction? We again This day will meet, Mardoniusâbut as none Of human texture can the flight foresee Of that inevitable dart, which soon, Or late will strike, I leave these words behind. If, blinded still by superstition's cloud, Thou wilt believe me in this hour the mark Of fate, retain them, as my dying words: Ambition curb; let virtue be thy pride. They separated sad; Mardonius still Foreboding evil to his noble friend, He at the frailty of Mardonius griev'd. Masistius, soon collecting round his tent The prime of Persian cavalry, bespake Their captains thus: Your steeds and arms prepare; String well your bows, your quivers store with shafts; With num'rous javelins each his courser load. I am this day your gen'ral; I rely On your known prowess; and I trust, the hand Of Horomazes will conduct you back Victorious; but remember, that the brave In life, or death, accomplishing their part, Are happy. All, rejoicing in a chief Belov'd, his orders sedulous fulfil. In arms, more splendid than for Peleus' son Th' immortal artist forg'd, Masistius cas'd His limbs of beauteous frame, and manly grace, To match that hero, whom Scamander saw With Dardan blood imbru'd. In hue of snow His horse, of all NisÃ¦a's breed the choice, Caparison'd in rubies, champs the gold, Which rules his mouth; his animated mane Floats o'er the bridle, form'd of golden braid. His page was nigh, that youth of eastern race, Whom for his merit pure Melissa gave To this benignant satrap. To ascend His gorgeous seat preparing, thus the chief: If I return a conqueror this day, To that excelling dame who made thee mine, Who hath enlarg'd whate'er of wise and great, Of just and temp'rate I to nature owe, Refin'd my manners, and my purest thoughts Exalted, I my friendship will prolong In gratitude and rev'rence; blessing heav'n, Which thus prefers Masistius to extend Benevolence to virtue. If I fall, Resume with her the happiest lot my care Can recommend, Statirus. Though no Greek, Her pupil, say, in offices humane Hath not been tardy; by her light inspir'd, He went more perfect to a noble grave. End of the Twenty-third Book. BOOK the Twenty-fourth. While thus Masistius for the field prepar'd, At sacrifice amidst the diff'rent chiefs Pausanias stood, the entrails to consult For heav'n's direction. Like a god rever'd Among the Spartans, was an augur fam'd, Tisamenus. The Pythian had declar'd Him first of prophets; he the rites performs; The victim open'd he inspects, and thus In solemn tone: Hear, Grecians, and obey The will of Jove. To pass th' Asopian flood Forbear. With Persian fetters in her hand Ill fortune seated on that bank I see, On this the laurel'd figure of success. The augur ceas'd; when suddenly in view Th' Asopian current, overswelling, foams With eastern squadrons, wading through the fords. Bounds in the van Masistius on a steed, Whose glist'ning hue the brightest of the four Which drew th' irradiate axle of the morn Might scarce outshine. Erect the hero sat, Firm as the son of DanaÃ« by Jove, When his strong pinion'd Pegasus he wheel'd Through Ãthiopian air from death to guard Andromeda his love. In rapid haste A herald greets Pausanias: From the men Of Megara I come. A post advanc'd, The most obnoxious in the Grecian line To harassing assaults, their daily toil With unabating firmness long has held. Unwonted numbers of Barbarian horse Now sweep the field; a reinforcement send, Her standard else will Megara withdraw. Pausanias then, alike to try the Greeks, And save his Spartans, answer'd: Chiefs, you hear; Who will be foremost to sustain our friends? Through fear the dang'rous service is declin'd By many. Indignation to behold No Spartans offer'd, but the arduous task Impos'd on others, held Cleander mute; When Aristides: Herald, swift return, Athenian aid might else prevent thy speed. The patriot spake, and left the Greeks amaz'd, Well knowing Athens with abhorrence look'd On Megara, her envious, ranc'rous foe Of ancient date, whom now she flies to aid. Meantime that feeblest station of the camp Th' impetuous Asian cavalry surround. As clouds, impregnated with hail, discharge Their stormy burden on a champaign rich In ripen'd grain, and lay the crackling rows Of Ceres prostrate; under sheets of darts, With arrows barb'd and javelins, thus whole ranks Of Megara, by wounds or death o'erthrown, Gasp on the ground. AlcathÃ¶us expires, The blood of Nisus, Megarensian prince In times remote, and fabled to have held His fate dependent on a purple hair Amidst his hoary locks. That vital thread His impious daughter sever'd, blind with love For Minos, Cretan king, her father's foe. Masistius pierc'd him; javelins from his arm Incessant flew; on heaps of nameless dead He laid Evenus, Lysicles, the youth Of Cyparissus, and Cratander's age, Distinguish'd each by office, wealth, or birth, Or martial actions. Beasts of chace and prey, The wolf and boar, the lion and the stag, Within close toils imprison'd, thus become The hunter's mark. The signal of retreat Is now uplifted by the hopeless chiefs; When, as a friendly gale with stiff'ning wings Repels a vessel, driving by the force Of boist'rous currents in a fatal track To bulge on rocks, a voluntary band Of men at arms, and bowmen, Attic all, Restrain the flight of Megara. Expert Their shaft? they level at the Persian steeds, Not at the riders. Soon around the plain Th' ungovern'd animals disperse, enrag'd By galling wounds. Olympiodorus, chief Among the light auxiliars, on the lists Of Pisa just Hellanodics had crown'd, The first of Greeks in archery. He stands Like Telamonian Teucer on the mound Of Atreus' son, where fate's unerring hand Had strung the bow which heap'd with Phrygian dead Th' empurpled fosse, while Ajax swung abroad The sev'n-fold shield to guard a brother's skill. Still in the field Masistius, who observ'd The active archer, from his lofty seat Against him whirls a javelin. Cimon near Receives the blunted weapon on the boss Of his huge buckler. His vindictive bow Olympiodorus bends; the rapid shaft Full in the forehead of the gen'rous steed He lodges deep. The high NisÃ¦an blood Boils in its channels through tormenting pain; Erect the courser paws in air, and hurls In writhing agitation from his back Th' illustrious rider on the plain supine. Against him rush th' Athenians; on his feet They find him brandishing his sabre keen, With his firm shield a bulwark to his breast, Like one of those earth-sprung in radiant arms, Whom the Cadm?an dragon's fruitful jaws Or Colchian serpent's teeth produc'd. Assail'd On ev'ry side, his fortitude augments With danger. Down to Pluto's realm he sends Iphicrates and Eurytus, who drank Callirrhoe's fountain; Amynander born On smooth Ilissus, and three gallant youths Of Marathon. His cuirass strong withstands Repeated blows; unwounded, but o'ercome By unremitted labour, on his knees, Like some proud structure half o'erthrown by time, He sinks at last. Brave Cimon hastes to save A foe so noble in his deeds, in port Beyond a mortal; when a vulgar sword That moment through the vizor of his helm Transfix'd the brain, so exquisitely form'd, The seat of purest sentiment and thought. His frame, in ruin beauteous still and great, The fatal stroke laid low. An earthquake thus Shook from his base that wonder of the world, The Colossean deity of Rhodes. Of danger all unheeding, by his lord Statirus kneel'd, and o'er his bosom spread His palms in anguish. Timely to protect The gentle youth ingenuous Cimon came, While thus the gasping satrap breath'd his last: Farewell, thou faithfulâBid Mardonius think How brief are life's enjoymentsâVirtue lives Through all eternityâBy virtue earn'd, Praise too is longâMelissaâgrant me thine. In death, refembling sweetest sleep, his eyes Serenely drop their curtains, and the soul Flies to th' eternal manfions of the just. Within the trenches Cimon straight commands To lodge the corse; when lo! another cloud Of Eastern squadrons, Mindarus their chief, Who, o'er the stream detach'd with numbers new, Not finding great Masistius, rous'd afresh The storm of onset. Dreadful was the shock Of these, attempting to redeem, of those, Who held the body; but the Attic spears Break in the chests of fiery steeds, which press With violence unyielding, and the ranks In front disarm. The archers have discharg'd Their quivers. Now had Mindarus acquir'd Undying glory, and the Greeks resign'd The long-contested prize, when threat'ning shouts, Of diff'rent Grecians, pouring from the camp, Alarm the eastern chief. Cleander here With all TrÅzenÃ¨, Arimnestus there, Diomedon's bold successor in arms, With his PlatÃ¦ans, and the Thespian brave, Alcimedon, assail the Persian flanks. So two hoarse torrents opposite descend From hills, where recent thunder-storms have burst; In the mid-vale the dashing waters meet To overwhelm the peasant's hopes and toil. Myronides and Ãschylus in sight, Each with his formidable phalanx moves; Th' encampment whole is arming. From the fight His mangled cavalry the Persian calls. In eager quest of refuge in their lines Beyond Asopus, through surrounding foes The coursers vault like swimmers, who forsake A found'ring vessel, and with buoyant strength Bound through the surge for safety on the beach. Triumphant in their camp the Greeks replace Their standards; thither Cimon's gen'rous care Transports Masistius. Eager to behold A prize so noble, curious throngs on throngs Press in disorder; each his station leaves; Confusion reigns. The gen'ral host to arms Pausanias sternly vigilant commands, And next provides a chariot to display, Throughout th' extensive lines, th' illustrious dead, In magnitude and beauty late the pride Of nature's study'd workmanship. His limbs The hand of Cimon tenderly compos'd, As would a brother to a brother's corse. Masistius fill'd the chariot; on his knees Statirus held, and water'd with his tears The face majestic, not by death deform'd, Pale, but with features mild, which still retain'd Attractive sweetness to endear the sight. First on the right through LacedÃ¦mon's range The spectacle is carried; silence there Prevails; the Spartan citizen no sign Of triumph shews, subordinate to law, Which disciplin'd his passions. Tow'rds the left, Through exultation loud of other Greeks, The awful car at length to Attic ranks Brings their own prize, by Aristides met; There silence too, in rev'rence of their chief, Is universal. He prepares to speak; But first the mighty reliques he surveys. He feels like Jove, contemplating the pure, The gen'rous, brave Sarpedon, as he lay In death's cold arms, when swift th' almighty sire Decreed that Morpheus, gentlest of the gods, Should waft to Lycia's realm the royal clay, From pious friends and subjects to obtain The rites of splendid sepulture. Complete Was now the solemn pause; to list'ning ears Thus Aristides vents his godlike soul: Here close your triumph, Grecians, nor provoke The jealous pow'rs who mark for chosen wrath O'er-weening pride. Though auguring success From this great satrap's fall, revere his clay; Such rev'rence all of mortal mold will need, All soon, or late. If comeliness and strength, If gracious manners, and a mind humane, If worth and wisdom could avoid the grave, You had not seen this tow'r of Asia fall. Yet there is left attainable by man, What may survive the grave; it is the fame Of gen'rous actions; this do you attain. I in Psittalia's isle this Persian knew Brave Medon's prize; his captive hands we freed; To him our hospitable faith we pledg'd, Through whom PhÅbean Timon was redeem'd, With Haliartus, on EubÅa's fields To signalize their swords. On Oeta's hill In him the daughter of OÃ¯leus found A spotless guardian. Let his corse and arms, Thy acquisition, Cimon, be resign'd To piety; a herald shall attend Thy steps; remove him to his native friends. Let Xerxes hear, let fierce Mardonius see, How much Barbarians differ from the Greeks. Minerva's tribes, approving, hear the words Of clemency and pity. Cimon mounts The fun'ral car; attentive and compos'd Like Maia's son, commission'd from the skies By his eternal sire, the warrior hears The full instructions of his patron chief. Th' Asopian stream he fords to Asia's tents, Whence issue wailing multitudes, who rend The air with ejulation, while the wheels Before Mardonius stop their solemn roll. He rives his mantle, and defiles with dust His splendid head. Not more the destin'd king Of Judah mourn'd the virtuous heir of Saul, Mow'd down in battle by Philistian strength On Gilboa's heights; nor melted more in grief O'er Absalom's fair locks, too much endear'd To blind parental fondness. From the car Descending, Cimon spake: Lo! Persian chief, The just Athenian, Aristides, sends These reliques, which he honours, to partake Of sepulture, as eastern rites ordain. Then art thou fall'n, too confident, exclaims Mardonius, too unmindful of my love, And anxious warnings! Mithra, veil thy face In clouds! In tears of blood, thou sky, dissolve! Earth groan, and gen'ral nature join in woe! The tallest cedar of the orient groves Lies prostrateâDestiny malign! I brave Thy further maliceâBlasted to the root Is all my joy. Here sorrow clos'd his lips. As frozen dead by wintry gusts he stood, Devoid of motion; Mindarus was nigh, Whose interposing prudence thus was heard: O chief of nations numberless! who stand Spectators round, and watch thy lightest look, Confine thy anguish; in their sight revere Thyself; regard this messenger benign From Aristides, and thy native sense Of obligation rouse. Mardonius then, As from a trance: I hear thee, and approve, My gentle kinsman. This returning car, With purest gold, and costly vesture pil'd, Shall bear the copious tribute of my thanks To Aristides; whom extoll'd to heav'n By excellent Masistius oft my soul Hath heard, the righteous by the righteous prais'd. Now Cimon interpos'd: That man extoll'd Thou dost not, Persian, lib'ral as thou art, Mean to offend; thy presents then with-hold. In poverty more glorious, than in wealth The wealthiest, Aristides frowns at gold. No costly vestures decorate his frame, Itself divine; the very arms he wears, The sole possession of that spotless man, All ornament reject; he only boasts The sharpest sword, the weightiest spear and shield. Ha! must I pass unthankful in the sight Of one, Masistius lov'd, the chief reply'd? No, answer'd quick th' Athenian; from his cross Take down Leonidas. A stedfast look Mardonius fix'd on Cimon: That request, O Greek! is big with danger to my head, Which I will hazard, since the only price Set on the precious reliques thou restor'st. This said, he orders to his tent the corse; There on the clay-cold bosom of his friend Thus plaintive hangs: Fall'n pillar of my hopes, What is Mardonius, wanting thy support! Thou arm of strength, for ever are unbrac'd Thy nerves! Enlighten'd mind, where prudence dwelt, Heart purify'd by honour, you have left Mardonius helpless; left him to himself, To his own passions, which thy counsel tam'd! The dang'rous paths of error I shall tread Without thy guidance! Shame, defeat and death, Frown in thy wounds ill-bodingâyet thy look Not fate itself of gentleness deprives. By heaven a world shall mourn theeâLoud he calls; Which Mindarus obeys. To him the chief: Thou too didst love MasistiusâFly, proclaim A gen'ral lamentation through the camp; Let all BÅotia sound Masistius lost. O verify'd too clearly, boding dream Of mine, by him so fatally despis'd! See ev'ry head dismantled of its hair, The soldiers, women, eunuchs; of his mane See ev'ry steed, the mule and camel shorn. O that the echo of our grief might pass The Hellespont to Asia! that her loss Through all her cities, through her vales, and streams, Beyond the banks of Ganges might be told! As Mindarus departs, the Theban chief Approaches, Leontiades, who spake: If there be one, O gen'ral, can replace Masistius wise, that prodigy is found, El?an Hegesistratus, of seers The most renown'd. His penetrating mind Can from the victim slain, or mystic flight Of birds, foresee the dark events of time; Invet'rate foe to Sparta, sore with wrongs, He comes thy servant. Opportune he comes, Replies Mardonius. In the rites of Greece Ten hecatombs, before the sun descends, Shall to Masistius bleed an off'ring high. I will engage this augur at a price Beyond his wishes; let his skill decide, When to give battle, and avenge my friend. Collect your Grecian artists; instant build A cenotaph in your DircÃ¦an grove, Where that pure fountain trills a mournful note. There shall Masistius in his name survive Among the Greeks; his last remains, embalm'd, Among his fathers shall in Susa rest. The Theban goes. Statirus next appears; Th' afflicted hero greets the weeping youth: Ah! poor Statirus! thou hast lost thy lord, I lost my friend, her bulwark Asia lost. The sacred clay to Artamanes bear, Left in TrachiniÃ¦ chief. His pious love (Who did not love Masistius) will convey To distant Sestos his embalm'd remains, Thence o'er the narrow Hellespont, to reach His native Asia, and his father's tomb. How did he fall, Statirus? Did he send To me no counsel from his dying lips? These, in a sigh the faithful page began, Were his last accents. âLet Mardonius think âHow brief are life's enjoyments. Virtue lives âThrough all eternity. By virtue earn'd âPraise too is longâMelissa, grant me thineâ. Commend me to Melissa, starting, spake The son of Gobryas. From the shameful cross Bid Artamanes in her presence free Leonidas the Spartan. Now perform Another act of duty to thy lord; Despoil my head of all its curling pride; Slight sacrifice to griefâbut ev'ry limb, Lopt from this body, and its mangled flesh Shall in the dust be scatter'd, ere I quit My chace of great revenge. Concluding here, He strides impetuous like a stately ram, Lord of the flock new-shorn. His giant guard Inclose him round; th' innumerable host Attend him, all divested of their hair, In howling anguish to an altar huge, By hasty hands constructed. Deep the earth Around is hollow'd, deep is drench'd with blood. Ten hundred sable victims heap the ground. Now gen'ral silence reigns, as o'er the main In winter, when HalcyonÃ¨ laments Her Ceyx lost, and Ãolus, her sire; By pity soften'd, all the air is calm, While she sits brooding on her watry nest. Amidst a cloud of frankincense the priest Of Elis, Hegesistratus, performs The rites of divination; awful thus At length unfolds the mysteries of time: Hear, all ye nations; great Mardonius, hear; Th' AsopÃ¯an channel is the line of fate; The host, which passes, falls; success will crown Th' assail'd; th' assailant is to slaughter doom'd. The multitude, discourag'd by the death Of their belov'd Masistius, hear in joy; Not so Mardonius at revenge delay'd. Inaction aggravates his pain; his tent Receives him. Solitary there, like night Within her cavern, thus he feeds his grief: âAmbition curb; let virtue be thy pride.â So spake Masistius, when we parted last To meet no moreâI feel ambition cold, Benumb'd by sorrowââLet Mardonius think, âHow brief are life's enjoyments;â so thy fate, Dear friend, evincesâLife itself is short; Its joys are shorter; yet the scanty span Adversity can lengthen, till we loathe. If, on the brilliant throne of Xerxes plac'd, I held the orient and Hesperian worlds My vassals, could the millions in my host Compel the adamantine gate of death To render back my friend? O tortur'd heart! Which burn'st with friendship, of thy gen'rous flame Th' inestimable object is no more. What then is greatness? What th' imperial robe, The diadem and scepter? Could you fill The void, his endless absence hath produc'd In my sad bosom? Were ye mine how vain The acquisition, which my grief would loathe, And, wak'd by grief, let honour timely shun, Lest from his grave Masistius should arise To shake my pillow with his nightly curse. Not hecatombs on hecatombs of bulls Heap'd on his manes, not the votive hair, Nor fun'ral moan of nations could avail To moderate his ire; nor all the pow'r Of empires join'd to empires guard my sleep. At length he sinks in slumber, not compos'd, But wanders restless through the wild of dreams. End of the Twenty-fourth Book. BOOK the Twenty-Fifth. Ere thus each augur in the diff'rent camps Unmann'd the soldier by religious dread, EubÅa's coast Sicinus had regain'd. That peopled island's force of ships and arms Themistocles had muster'd. Oreus held The ready chief, expecting weighty news From Aristides, which Sicinus swift Imparts. To him Themistocles: My friend, I ask no more; the assembled host of Greece Hath fix'd Mardonius on th' Asopian verge; A hasty conflict Aristides shuns; Then shall the blow, I meditate, be struck, Ere thy reverted passage can transmit To him my greetings. Stay and see my oars For infamous Thessalia dash the waves; Her Aleuadian race of tyrants foul, Friends to Barbarians, traitors to the Greeks, Shall feel my scourge. Her plenty I will bar Against Mardonius; famine shall invade His tents, and force him to unequal fight. He gives command; the signal is uprear'd For embarkation. All EubÅa pours Her sons aboard, and loads the groaning decks. From his Cleora Hyacinthus parts, Brave Haliartus from his new-espous'd AcanthÃ¨. Lo! each female seeks the beach, Spectatress eager of th' alluring man, Whose artful eye could summon ev'ry grace To fascinate both sexes, and his wiles Arm with enchantment. Beauteous and august Like CybelÃ¨, prime goddess, turret-crown'd, Source of th' ethereal race, his consort lifts Above the rest her countenance sublime. By her own offspring, and the pledges dear Of Aristides, which her hand receiv'd At Salamis, and cherish'd like her own, She stands encircled, her embarking lord Accosting thus: Unfavourable winds, Or fortune's frown I fear not. All the gods Of earth and ocean, who delighted view The virtuous brave, contending for their laws With lawless tyrants, will combine to bless Themistocles and Aristides link'd In harmony of counsels. See, dear lord, His and thy children interweave their hands; Thy sure success I augur from their smiles. I from Timothea's, gallantly replies The parting chief. This union is thy work; Thine be the praise from thankful Greece preserv'd. He said, and lightly to his vessel pass'd; While ev'ry sail was op'ning to the wind. EubÅa, where she fronts the Malian shore, Beneath a promontory's quiet lee Protects the fleet benighted. Here the son Of Neocles aboard his galley calls His pupil Hyacinthus, whom he thus Instructs: Young hero, since Cleora's love Could not detain thee from the lists of fame, Fame thou shalt win. Thessalia's nearest bounds I from Spercheos in TrachiniÃ¦'s bay Mean to invade. Nicanor and thyself With your Carystian force, Nearchus brave With his Chalcidians, must a distant course To PotidÃ¦a take, whose valiant race The winter siege of great Masistius foil'd. Forewarn'd by due intelligence from me, They will augment your numbers. Through the mouth Of fam'd Enipeus PotidÃ¦an zeal Will guide your helms to rich Larissa's walls, Thessalia's helpless capital, whose youth Attend Mardonius. Land, and burn th' abode Of Aleuadian Thorax, who conducts The foe through Greece. O'er all the region spread; Where'er thou seest an Aleuadian roof, The residence of traitors hurl to earth; The flocks and herds from ev'ry pasture sweep, From ev'ry store th' accumulated grain, Support of Asia's myriads. O! recall Thy late achievements on the bloody fields Of Chalcis, and of Oreus. They, who brav'd Thy native coast, of Demonax the friends, Now in their own Thessalia lie thy spoil; On their wide ruins build thee trophies new. Commission'd thus, the animated youth With each Carystian, each Chalcidic prow, By morning sails. Three days the Attic chief, Skreen'd in a harbour nigh CenÃ¦um's point, Rests on his anchors. So, by thickets hid In fell Hyrcania, nurse of rav'nous broods, The tiger lurks, and meditates unseen A sudden sally on his heedless prey. The fourth gay dawn with fresh'ning breezes curls The Malian waters. In Barbaric flags The wily chief apparelling his masts Fallacious, ere the horizontal sun Couch'd on the ocean, fills with hostile prows The wide Sperchean mouth. Along the vales Innumerable carriages display The plenty huge for Asia's camp amass'd. Th' encircling mountains all their echoes blend In one continu'd sound with bleating flocks, With bellowing herds, and dissonant uproar Of their conductors; whom Thessalia sent, Whom all the extent of Thracia, and the realm Of Amarantha's lord. Th' affrighted hinds Desert their charge. TrachiniÃ¦'s neighb'ring gates With fugitives are throng'd. Lo! Cleon plants His bold Eretrian banners on the strand; The Styrians form; Eudemus bounds ashore, GerÃ¦stians follow; then auxiliars new, The subjects late of Demonax; the troops Of Locrian Medon, Delphian Timon land, Themistocles the last; whose chosen guard Of fifty Attic, fifty Spartan youths, Still sedulous and faithful close the rear. They reach'd in order'd march Trachinian walls, Whose gates unclos'd. Majestical advanc'd A form rever'd by universal Greece, Prais'd by each tongue, by ev'ry eye admir'd, The OÃ¯lean priestess of th' immortal Nine, The goddess-like Melissa. Medon swift, With Haliartus, met her sacred step. Her name divulg'd from ev'ry station call'd The gazing chiefs, Themistocles the first; Whom, by her brother pointed out to view, She thus address'd: Themistocles, give ear, And thou, O Medon, whom, a stranger long To my desiring eyes, they see restor'd. Well may you wonder, that a hostile fort Melissa's hand delivers to your pow'r. There is a Persian worthy to be rank'd Among the first of Grecians. Just, humane, Thy captive, Medon, amply hath discharg'd His price of ransom. Nine revolving moons Beheld Masistius guardian of my hill In purity of rev'rence to my fane, My person, my dependents. I forsook At Amarantha's suit my old abode; A virtuous princess from a sickly couch My care hath rais'd, SandaucÃ¨, in those walls Long resident with me. Two days are past Since Artamanes, governing these tracts, Heard of a navy on Thessalia's coast, And with his force, though slender, took the field To guard Larissa. Your descent unmans The few remaining Persians in the fort; All with SandaucÃ¨ and her children flew To my protection; mercy to obtain Became my charge; her terrors will disperse, Soon as she knows, Themistocles is nigh. The army halts. TrachiniÃ¦'s gates admit Cecropia's hero, Medon, and the son Of Lygdamis. SandaucÃ¨ they approach, SandaucÃ¨ late in convalescent charms Fresh, as a May-blown rose, by pallid fear Now languid, as a lily beat with rain, Till she discovers with transported looks Her Salaminian guardian; then the warmth Of gratitude, redoubling all her bloom, Before him throws her prostrate. To him ran The recollecting children, who embrace Their benefactor's knees. She thus unfolds Her lips, whose tuneful exclamation charms: O, my protectorâInterposing swift, His ready hand uplifts her from the ground. Do not disgrace me, thou excelling fair, He said; to leave such beauty thus depress'd Would derogate from manhood. She replies: Forbear to think my present captive lot Hath humbled thus SandaucÃ¨. No, the weight Of obligation past, my rescu'd babes In Salamis, myself from horror sav'd, Have bent my thankful knee. No fears debase My bosom now; Themistocles I see, In him a known preserver. Melting by, Melissa, Medon, Haliartus, shed The tend'rest dews of sympathy. In look Compassionate, but calm, the chief rejoins: Suggest thy wishes, princess, and command My full compliance. She these accents sighs: Ye gen'rous men, what pity is not due To eastern women! Prize, ye Grecian dames, Your envy'd state. When your intrepid lords In arms contend with danger on the plain, You in domestic peace are left behind Among your letter'd progeny, to form Their ductile minds, and exercise your skill In arts of elegance and use. Alas! Our wretched race, in ignorance and sloth By Asia nurtur'd, like a captive train, In wheeling dungeons with our infants clos'd, Must wait th' event of some tremendous hour, Which, unpropitious, leaves us on the field A spoil of war. What myriads of my sex From Greece to distant Hellespont bestrew The ways, and whiten with their bleaching bones The Thracian wilds! Spercheos views the tomb Of Ariana, hapless sister, laid In foreign mold! My portion of distress You know, benignant guardians, who asswag'd My suff'rings. Then to quit the direful scene, Revisiting my native soil, to rest Among my children, and instruct their youth, As kind Melissa hath instructed mine, Were sure no wish immoderate or vague. But ArtamanesâBlushing, trembling, here She paus'd. Melissa takes the word: Sweet friend, Let vice, not virtue blush. Cecropian chief, Her soft attention well that youth deserves, She all his constancy and care. Their hands Are pledg'd; th' assent of Asia's king alone Is wanting, which Mardonius hath assur'd To Artamanes, flow'r of Asia's peers. Him, with unequal force, to battle march'd Against thy ranks, which never have been foil'd, She knows, and trembles. Artfully replies Themistocles: SandaucÃ¨ may prevent This danger. Let her messenger convey A kind injunction, that the noble youth, Whose merit I have treasur'd in my breast, May sheath his fruitless weapons, and, return'd To her, aboard my well-appointed keel With her embarking, seek their native soil. The princess hears, and joyfully provides A messenger of trust. Assembling now His captains, thus Themistocles ordains: Friends of EubÅa, soon as PhÅbus dawns Your progress bend to LarissÃ¦an tow'rs; Your chief is Cleon. Hyacinthus join; To your united force the foe must yield. Save Artamanes; bring him captive back, But not with less humanity than care. Accomplish'd Medon, Haliartus, vers'd In Oeta's neighb'ring wilds, your Locrians plant Among the passes; once secur'd, they leave Us at our leisure to contrive and act. Thee, honour'd seer of Delphi, at my side In this Trachinian station I retain. By op'ning day each leader on his charge Proceeds. Themistocles inspects the vale, Constrains the peasants from unnumber'd cars Aboard his fleet to lade the golden grain. Before ThermopylÃ¦ the Locrian files Appear. From Oeta's topmast peak, behold, O'er Medon's head a vulture wings his flight, Whom to a cross beside the public way Th' OÃ¯lean hero's curious eye pursues. Oh! stay thy rav'nous beak, in anguish loud Cries Haliartus. Shudder while thou hear'st, Son of OÃ¯leus; on that hideous pile The bones of great Leonidas are hung. Then Medon's cool, delib'rate mind was shook By agitation to his nature strange. His spear and buckler to the ground he hurl'd; Before th' illustrious ruins on his knee He sunk, and thus in agony exclaim'd: Should this flagitious profanation pass Unpunish'd still, th' existence of the gods Were but a dream. O, long-enduring Jove! Thy own Herculean offspring canst thou see Defac'd by vultures, and the parching wind, Yet wield resistless thunderâBut thy ways Are awfully mysterious; to arraign Thy heaviest doom is blasphemy. Thy will For me reserv'd the merit to redeem These precious reliques; penitent I own My rashness; thankful I accept the task. O mighty spirit! who didst late inform With ev'ry virtue that disfigur'd frame, With ev'ry kind affection prov'd by me, The last distinguish'd object of thy care, When it forbad me to partake thy fate, The life, thy friendship sav'd, I here devote To vindicate thy manes. Not the wrongs Of gen'ral Greece, not Locris giv'n to flames, Not the subversion of my father's house, E'er with such keen resentment stung my heart, As this indignity to thee. He said, And, with the aid of Haliartus, free'd The sacred bones; Leonteus, and the prime Of Locris, frame with substituted shields Th' extemporeanous bier. Again the chief: Leonteus, Haliartus, rest behind; Achieve th' important service, which the son Of Neocles enjoins. The pious charge Be mine of rend'ring to Melissa's care These honour'd reliques. Now in measur'd pace The warlike bearers tread; their manly breasts Not long withhold the tribute of their sighs Ingenuous; tears accompany their steps. His sister in TrachiniÃ¦ Medon soon Approaches; glad she hears him, and replies. Hail! brother, hail! thou chosen by the gods From longer shame to rescue these remains, Which once contain'd whate'er is good and great Among the sons of men. Majestic shade! By unrelenting laws of Dis forbid To enter, where thy ancestors reside; Who, seed of Jove, to their Elysian joys Expect thee, most illustrious of the race. Amidst thy wand'rings on the banks of Styx, Dost thou recall Melissa's dirge of praise O'er thee, preparing by a glorious death To save thy country? O! unbury'd still, Did not Melissa promise to thy dust Peace in her temple? An atrocious king Hath barr'd awhile th' accomplishment; thy friend, Thy soldier, now will ratify my word. Soon to Lycurgus shall thy spirit pass, To Orpheus, Homer, and th' AscrÃ¦an sage, Who shall contend to praise thee in their bow'rs Of amaranth and myrtle, ever young Like thy renown. In Oeta's fane these bones, Dear to the Muses, shall repose, till Greece, Amid her future triumphs, hath decreed A tomb and temple to her saviour's fame. This high oblation of pathetic praise, Paid by her holy friend, SandaucÃ¨ notes Attentive; seldom from Melissa's eye Was she remote. Her eunuchs she deputes To bring a coffer large of od'rous wood Inlaid with pearl, repository due To such divine remains. In time appears Th' Athenian gen'ral to applaud the deed, While thus the mighty manes he invokes: Hear, thou preserver of thy country, hear! Lo! in his palms of Salamis the son Of Neocles salutes thee. From a hand, Which hath already half aveng'd thy death, Accept of decent rites. Thy virtue sav'd A nation; they hereafter shall complete Thy sun'ral honours, and surround thy tomb With trophies equal to thy deathless name. He ceas'd. Her mantle on the solemn scene Night from her car in dusky folds outspread. Three mornings pass. Anon Sperch?an banks Re-echo shouts of triumph, while the vales Are clad in arms. Lo! Cleon is return'd, Uplifting bloodless ensigns of success, And thus accosts Themistocles: Thy prize, This Persian lord receive; our hasty march O'ertook his rear. From LarissÃ¦an tow'rs, A recent conquest, Hyacinthus, join'd By PotidÃ¦ans, and Olynthian spears, Was then in sight. The herald I detach'd With fair SandaucÃ¨'s message, and thy terms Of peace and safety; Artamanes found Resistance vain, and yielded. From the van Now stepp'd the Persian graceful, and bespake Themistocles: Accept a second time Thy captive, gen'rous Grecian; nor impute To want of prowess, or to fond excess Of acquiescence to SandaucÃ¨'s will, My unreserv'd surrender. To have stain'd By fruitless contest thy triumphant wreaths With blood, and spurn'd the bounty of thy hand, Had prov'd ingratitude in me. These words Cecropia's chief return'd: Receive my hand, Thy pledge of freedom here not less secure, Than heretofore at Salamis, thy pledge Of bliss yet more endearing. Soon my keel Shall place thee happy on thy native coast, Thee and thy princess; that in future days You may at least of all the Asian breed Report my kindness, and forget my sword. Amidst his words a soft complaining trill Of Philomela interrupts their sound. The youthful satrap then: That pensive bird, SandaucÃ¨'s warbling summoner, is wont In evening shade on Ariana's tomb To sit and sing; my princess there devotes In melancholy solitude this hour To meditation, which dissolves in tears. Then greet her, said th' Athenian; thy return Will sooth her tender breast. My promise add, That on the first fair whisper of the winds, She shall revisit her maternal soil. This said, they parted. At her sister's grave The satrap join'd his princess. He began: I have obey'd thy summons. No disgrace Was my surrender to the conqu'ring sword, Which Persia long hath felt. Thy servant comes No more a captive, but to thee by choice; Themistocles all bounteous and humane, As heretofore, I find. Forbear to check That rising birth of smiles; in perfect light Those half-illuminated eyes attire; Enough the tribute of their tears hath lav'd These precious tombs. Prepare thee to embark; Themistocles hath promis'd thou shalt leave A land, whose soaring genius hath depress'd The languid plumes of Asia. Lift thy head In pleasing hope to clasp thy mother's knees, To change thy weeds of mourning, and receive A royal brother's gift, this faithful hand. Nigh Ariana's clay Autarctus slept. Divine SandaucÃ¨ on her husband's tomb, With marble pomp constructed by the care Of Artamanes, fix'd a pensive look In silence. Sudden from the cluster'd shrubs, O'erhanging round it, tuneful all and blithe A flight of feather'd warblers, which abound Through each Thessalian vale, in carrol sweet Perch on the awful monument. The sun Streaks with a parting, but unsully'd ray Their lively change of plumage, and each rill Is soften'd by their melody. Accept, Accept this omen, Artamanes cries; Autarctus favours, Horomazes smiles, Whose choir of songsters not unprompted seem Our nuptial hymn preluding. She replies: I want no omen to confirm thy truth. Dust of my sister, of my lord, farewell; Secure in Grecian piety remain. Still in his offspring will SandaucÃ¨ love That husband, thou, my Artamanes, still Revere that friend. She said, and dropp'd her hand, Press'd by the youth. With purity their guide, They o'er the mead Sperch?an slowly seek Trachinian portals. PhÅbe on their heads Lets fall a spotless canopy of light. End of the Twenty-fifth Book. BOOK the Twenty-sixth. From her Tithonian couch Aurora mounts The sky. In rev'rence now of Sparta's name, Yet more of dead Leonidas, three days To preparation for his burial rites Themistocles decrees. To curious search Innumerable herds and flocks supply Selected victims. Of their hairy pines To frame the stately pyre the hills are shorn. Amid this labour Hyacinthus, rich In Aleuadian spoil, his colleague brave Nicanor, all the PotidÃ¦an bands, Th' Olynthians, and Nearchus, who conducts The youth of Chaleis, reinforce the camp With their victorious ranks. Th' appointed day Was then arriv'd. A broad constructed pyre Tow'rs in the center of TrachiniÃ¦'s plain; The diff'rent standards of the Grecian host Are planted round. The Attic chief convenes The fifty Spartans of his guard, and thus: Themistocles, distinguish'd by your state, By your assiduous courage long sustain'd, Will now repay these benefits. Your king, Leonidas, the brightest star of Greece, No more shall wander in the gloom of Styx; But that last passage to immortal seats Through me obtain. Greek institutes require The nearest kindred on the fun'ral stage The dead to lay, the victims to dispose, To pour libations, and the sacred dust Inurn. Alone of these assembled Greeks Are you the hero's countrymen; alone Your hands the pious office shall discharge. Th' obedient Spartans from TrachiniÃ¦'s gates Produce to view the venerable bones Herculean. Lifted up the structure high Of pines and cedars, on the surface large All, which of great Leonidas remains, By sedulous devotion is compos'd. The various captains follow, some in gaze Of wonder, others weeping. Last appears Melissa, trailing her pontific pall (CalliopÃ¨ in semblance) with her troop Of snowy-vested nymphs from Oeta's hill, With all her vassals, decently arrang'd By Mycon's care. Two hecatombs are slain, Of sheep five hundred, and libations pour'd Of richest wine. A Spartan now applies The ruddy firebrand. In his priestly robe PhÅbean Timon supplicates a breeze From Ãolus to raise the creeping flame. Thrice round the crackling heaps the silent host, With shields revers'd, and spears inclining low, Their solemn movement wind. The shrinking pyre Now glows in embers; fresh libations damp The heat. A vase of silver high-emboss'd, By Hyacinthus from Larissa brought, Spoil of th' abode which treach'rous Thorax held, Receives the sacred ashes, and is plac'd Before Melissa. So the godlike son Of Neocles directs. An awful sign From her commands attention; thus she spake: Thou art not dead, Leonidas; thy mind In ev'ry Grecian lives. Thy mortal part, Transform'd to ashes, shall on Oeta's hill Among the celebrating Muses dwell In glory; while through animated Greece Thy virtue's inextinguishable fires Propitious beam, and, like the flames of Jove, Intimidate her foes. Not wine, nor oil, Nor blood of hecatombs, profusely spilt, Can to thy manes pay the tribute due; The massacre of nations, all the spoil Of humbled Asia, Destiny hath mark'd For consecration of thy future tomb. Two ministers my soul prophetic sees, Themistocles and Aristides stand Presiding o'er the sacrifice. The earth, The sea, shall witness to the mighty rites. Cease to regret the transitory doom Of thy remains insulted, no disgrace To thee, but Xerxes. Pass, exalted shade, The bounds of Dis, nor longer wail thy term Of wand'ring now elaps'd; all measur'd time Is nothing to eternity. Assume Among the bless'd thy everlasting seat. Th' indignity, thy earthly frame endur'd, Perhaps the gods permitted in their love To fill the measure of celestial wrath Against thy country's foes; then rest in peace, Thou twice illustrious victim to her weal. As, when Minerva in th' Olympian hall Amid the synod of celestials pour'd Her eloquence and wisdom, ev'ry god In silence heard, and Jove himself approv'd; Around Melissa thus were seen the chiefs In admiration bound; o'er all supreme Themistocles applauded. Mycon last, With her injunction charg'd, to Oeta's shrine Was now transporting in their polish'd urn The treasur'd ashes, when along the plain A sudden, new appearance strikes the sight, A fun'ral car, attended by a troop Of olive-bearing mourners. They approach Melissa; suppliant in her view expose Embalm'd Masistius. Sent from Asia's camp, A passage these had recently obtain'd From good Leonteus, by his brother plac'd ThermopylÃ¦'s sure guard. Melissa knew The page Statirus, foremost of the train, Who at her feet in agony began: Thy late protector, cold in death's embrace, Survey, thou holy paragon; his fall Asopus saw. Before the hero climb'd His fatal steed, to me this charge he gave. âIf I return a conqueror this day, âTo that excelling dame who made thee mine, âWho hath enlarg'd whate'er of wise and great, âOf just and temp'rate I to nature owe, âRefin'd my manners, and my purest thoughts âExalted, I my friendship will prolong âIn gratitude and rev'rence; blessing heav'n, âWhich thus prefers Masistius to extend âBenevolence to virtue. If I fall, âResume with her the happiest lot my care âCan recommend, Statirus. Though no Greek, âHer pupil, say, in offices humane âHath not been tardy; by her light inspir'd, âHe went more perfect to a noble grave.â Cast from his wounded courser, he, o'erpow'r'd By numbers, died. The body was restor'd By Aristides, of unrivall'd fame Among the just and gen'rous. O'er the dead Mardonius rent his vesture, and his hair, Then thus ordain'd: âThis precious clay embalm'd âTo Artamanes bear, whose pious zeal âA friend's remains to Sestus will convey, âThence o'er the narrow Hellespont to reach âHis native Asia, and his father's tomb.â I then repeated what my virtuous lord, Expiring, utter'd: âLet Mardonius think âHow brief are life's enjoyments. Virtue lives âThrough all eternity. By virtue earn'd âPraise too is longâMelissa, grant me thineâ. âCommend me to Melissa, starting, spake âThe son of Gobryas. From the shameful cross âBid Artamanes in her presence free âLeonidas the Spartan.â All my charge Is now accomplish'd faithfully to all. Not far was Artamanes. From the train Of Persians strode a giant stern in look, Who thus address'd the satrap: Prince, behold Briareus; hither by Mardonius sent, Guard of this noble body, I appear A witness too of thy disgrace; I see These Greeks thy victors. Is th' Athenian chief Among the band? Themistocles advanc'd; To whom Briareus: Art thou he, who dar'd My lord to battle on the plains of Thebes? Where have thy fears confin'd thee till this hour That I reproach thee with thy promise pledg'd? But this inglorious enterprize on herds, On flocks, and helpless peasants, was more safe, Than to abide Mardonius in the field. I now return. What tidings shall I bear From thee, great conqueror of beeves and sheep? Say, I am safe, Themistocles replies In calm derision, and the fun'ral rites, Thus at my leisure, to Laconia's king Perform, while your Mardonius sleeps in Thebes. The spirit of Leonidas, in me Reviving, shall from Oeta's distant top Shake your pavilions on Asopian banks. Yet, in return for his recover'd bones, I, undisputed master of the main, Will waft Masistius to a Persian grave. Thou mayst depart in safety, as thou cam'st. The savage hears, and sullenly retreats; While pious Medon thus accosts the dead: Thou son of honour, to thy promise just, Melissa's brother venerates the clay Of her avow'd protector. Let my care Preserve these reliques where no greedy worm, Nor hand profane, may violate thy form; Till friendly gales transport thee to repose Among thy fathers. Through Trachinian gates He leads the sable chariot, thence conveys Th' illustrious burden to Melissa's roof; Statirus aids. The priestess, there apart, Bespake her brother thus: My tend'rest tears, From public notice painfully conceal'd, Shall in thy presence have a lib'ral flow. Thou gav'st me this protector; honour, truth, Humanity, and wisdom like thy own, Were his appendage. Virtue is the same In strangers, kindred, enemies and friends. He won my friendshipâmight in earlier days Have kindled passionâO! since fate decreed Thee from Asopus never to return; If by Melissa's precepts thou inspir'd Didst go more perfect to a noble grave, I bless the hours; and memory shall hold Each moment dear, when, list'ning to my voice, Thou sat'st delighted in the moral strain. Leonidas and thou may pass the floods Of Styx together; in your happy groves Think of Melissa. Welcom'd were ye both By her on earth; her tongue shall never cease, Her lyre be never wanting to resound Thee, pride of Asia, him, the first of Greeks, In blended eulogy of grateful song. She o'er the dead through half the solemn night A copious web of eloquence unwinds, Explaining how Masistius had consum'd Nine lunar cycles in assiduous zeal To guard her fane, her vassals to befriend; How they ador'd his presence; how he won Her from the temple to SandaucÃ¨'s cure At Amarantha's suit; within his tent How clemency and justice still abode To awe Barbarians; how, departing sad, His last farewell at Oeta's shrine he gave In words like these: âUnrivall'd dame, we march âAgainst thy countryâThou should'st wish our fall. âIf we prevail, be confident in me âThy safeguard stillâBut heav'n, perhaps, ordains That thou shalt never want Masistius more. She pauses. Now her mental pow'rs sublime, Collected all, this invocation frame. O eleutherian sire! this virtuous light, By thee extinguish'd, proves thy care of Greece. Who of the tribes Barbarian now survives To draw thy favour? Gratitude requires This pure libation of my tears to lave Him once my guardian; but a guardian new, Thy gift in Medon, elevates at last My gratitude to thee. Serene she clos'd, Embrac'd her brother, and retir'd to rest. From Oeta's heights fresh rose the morning breeze. A well-apparell'd galley lay unmoor'd In readiness to sail. SandaucÃ¨ drops A parting tear on kind Melissa's breast, By whom dismiss'd, Statirus on the corse Of great Masistius waits. The Grecian chiefs Lead Artamanes to the friendly deck, In olive wreaths, pacific sign, attir'd, Whence he the fervour of his bosom pours: O may this gale with gentleness of breath Replace me joyous in my seat of birth, As I sincere on Horomazes call To send the dove of peace, whose placid wing The oriental and Hesperian world May feel, composing enmity and thirst Of mutual havoc! that my grateful roof May then admit Themistocles, and all Those noble Grecians, who sustain'd my head, Their captive thrice. But ah! what founts of blood Will fate still open to o'er flow the earth! Yet may your homes inviolate remain, Imparting long the fulness of those joys, Which by your bounty I shall soon possess! He ceas'd. The struggle of Sandauce's heart Suppress'd her voice. And now the naval pipe Collects the rowers. At the signal shrill They cleave with equal strokes the Malian floods. Meantime a vessel, underneath the lee Of Locris coasting, plies the rapid oar In sight. She veers, and, lodging in her sails The wind transverse, across the haven skims; Till on Sperch?an sands she rests her keel. Themistocles was musing on the turns Of human fortune, and the jealous eye Of stern republics, vigilantly bent Against successful greatness; yet serene, Prepar'd for ev'ry possible reverse In his own fortune, he the present thought, Of Persians chang'd from foes to friends, enjoy'd. When lo! Sicinus landed. Swift his lord In words like these the faithful man approach'd. From Aristides hail! Asopus flows, Still undisturb'd by war, between the hosts Inactive. Each the other to assail Inflexibly their augurs have forbid. The camp, which Ceres shall the best supply, Will gain the palm. Mardonius then must fight To our advantage both of time and place, Themistocles replies, and sudden calls The diff'rent leaders round him. Thus he spake: EubÅans, Delphians, Locrians, you, the chiefs Of PotidÃ¦a and Olynthus, hear. The ritual honours to a hero due, Whom none e'er equall'd, incomplete are left; Them shall the new Aurora see resum'd. At leisure now three days to solemn games I dedicate. Amid his num'rous tents Mardonius on Asopus shall be told, While he sits trembling o'er the hostile flood, Of Grecian warriors on the Malian sands Disporting. You in gymnic lists shall wing The flying spear, and hurl the massy disk, Brace on the cÃ¦stus, and impel the car To celebrate Leonidas in sight Of Oeta, witness to his glorious fate. But fifty vessels deep with laden stores I first detach, that gen'ral Greece may share In our superfluous plenty. Want shall waste Mardonian numbers, while profusion flows Round Aristides. To protect, my friends, Th' important freight, three thousand warlike spears Must be embark'd. You, leaders, now decide, Who shall with me ThermopylÃ¦ maintain, Who join the Grecian camp. First Medon rose: From thy successful banner to depart Believe my feet reluctant. From his cross When I deliver'd LacedÃ¦mon's king, My life, a boon his friendship once bestow'd, I then devoted in the face of heav'n To vindicate his manes. What my joy, If I survive, if perish, what my praise To imitate his virtue? Greece demands In his behalf a sacrifice like this From me, who, dying, only shall discharge The debt I owe him; where so well discharge, As at Asopus in the gen'ral shock Of Greece and Asia? But the hundred spears, Which have so long accompany'd my steps Through all their wand'rings, are the only force My wants require. The rest of Locrian arms Shall with Leonteus thy controul obey. Pois'd on his shield, and cas'd in Carian steel, Whence issued lustre like PhÅbean rays, Thus Haliartus: Me, in peasant-weeds, Leonidas respected. Though my heart Then by unshaken gratitude was bound, My humble state could only feel, not act. A soldier now, my efforts I must join With godlike Medon's, to avenge the wrongs Of Sparta's king. But first the soldier's skill, My recent acquisition, let my arm Forever lose, if once my heart forget The gen'rous chief, whose service try'd my arm, Who made AcanthÃ¨ mine. My present zeal His manly justice will forbear to chide. The priest of Delphi next: Athenian friend, I have a daughter on Cadm?an plains, My Amarantha. From no other care, Than to be nearer that excelling child, Would I forsake this memorable spot, Where died the first of Spartans, and a chief Like thee triumphant celebrates that death. Then Cleon proffer'd his Eretrian band, Eight hundred breathing vengeance on a foe, Who laid their tow'rs in ashes. Lampon next Presents his Styrians. Brave Nearchus joins Twelve hundred youths of Chalcis. Tideus last Of PotidÃ¦a twice three hundred shields. Enough, your number is complete, the son Of Neocles reminds them. Swift embark; The gale invites. Sicinus is your guide. He said, and, moving tow'rds the beach, observes The embarkation. Each progressive keel His eye pursues. O'erswelling now in thought, His own deservings, glory and success, Rush on his soul like torrents, which disturb A limpid fount. Of purity depriv'd, The rill no more in music steals along, But harsh and turbid through its channel foams. What sea, what coast, what region have I pass'd Without erecting trophies, cries the chief In exultation to Sicinus staid? Have I not spar'd the vanquish'd to resound My clemency? Ev'n Persians are my friends. These are my warriors. Prosp'rous be your sails, Ye Greeks, enroll'd by me, by me inur'd To arms and conquest. Under Fortune's wing Speed, and assist my ancient rival's arm To crush th' invader. Distant I uphold The Grecian armies; distant I will snatch My share of laurels on the plains of Thebes. Then come, soft peace, of indolence the nurse, Not to the son of Neocles. On gold Let rigour look contemptuous; I, return'd To desert Athens, I, enrich'd with spoils Of potentates, and kings, will raise her head From dust. Superb her structures shall proclaim No less a marvel, than the matchless bird The glory of Arabia, when, consum'd In burning frankincense and myrrh, he shews His presence new, and, op'ning to the sun Regenerated gloss of plumage, tow'rs, Himself a species. So shall Athens rise Bright from her ashes, mistress sole of Greece. From long PirÃ¦an walls her winged pow'r Shall awe the Orient, and Hesperian worlds. Me shall th' Olympic festival admit Its spectacle most splendid.... Ah! suppress Immod'rate thoughts, Sicinus interrupts, Thou citizen of Athens! Who aspires, Resides not there secure. Forbear to sting Her ever-wakeful jealousy, nor tempt The woes of exile. For excess of worth Was Aristides banish'd. Be not driv'n To early trial of thy Persian friends. O! thou transcendent, thou stupendous man, From thy Timothea moderation learn, Which, like the stealing touch of gentle time O'er canvass, pencil'd by excelling art, Smooths glaring colours, and imparts a grace To mightiest heroes. Thus their dazzling blaze Of glory soft'ning, softens envy's eye. End of the Twenty-Sixth Book. BOOK the Twenty-seventh. Meantime Briareus to the plains of Thebes Precipitates his course. Arriv'd, he greets Mardonius. Rumour had already told, What, now confirm'd, o'erwhelms the troubled chief, Confounded like the first anointed king O'er Israel's tribes, when Philist?an din Of armies pierc'd his borders, and despair Seduc'd his languid spirit to consult The sorceress of Endor. Call, he said, El?an HegesistratusâBe swift. The summon'd augur comes. To him the son Of Gobryas: Foe to Sparta, heed my words; Themistocles possesses on our backs Th' OetÃ¦an passes. Famine, like a beast, Noos'd and subservient to that fraudful man, Who shuns the promis'd contest in the field, He can turn loose against us. In our front See Aristides. Fatal is delay. Fam'd are the oracles of GreeceâAlas! My oracle, Masistius, is no more. To thee, who hatest all the Spartan breed, I trust my secret purpose. Be my guide To some near temple, or mysterious cave, Whence voices supernatural unfold The destinies of men. The augur here: The nearest, but most awful, is a cave Oracular, Lebadia's ancient boast, Where Jupiter Trophonius is ador'd, Not far beyond CopÃ¦Ã¦'s neighb'ring lake, Which thou must pass. With costly presents freight, Such as magnificence like thine requires, Thy loaded bark; command my service all. Mardonius issues orders to provide The bark and presents. Summoning his chiefs, To them he spake: My absence from the camp Important functions claim; three days of rule To Mindarus I cede. Till my return Let not a squadron pass th' Asopian stream. This said, with Hegesistratus he mounts A rapid car. Twelve giants of his guard, Detach'd before, await him on the banks Of clear CopÃ¦Ã¦. Silver PhÅbÃ¨ spreads A light, reposing on the quiet lake, Save where the snowy rival of her hue, The gliding swan, behind him leaves a trail In luminous vibration. Lo! an isle Swells on the surface. Marble structures there New gloss of beauty borrow from the moon To deck the shore. Now silence gently yields To measur'd strokes of oars. The orange groves, In rich profusion round the fertile verge, Impart to fanning breezes fresh perfumes Exhaustless, visiting the sense with sweets, Which soften ev'n Briareus; but the son Of Gobryas, heavy with devouring care, Uncharm'd, unheeding sits. At length began Th' El?an augur, in a learned flow Of ancient lore, to Asia's pensive chief Historically thus: Illustrious lord, Whose nod controuls such multitudes in arms From lands remote and near, the story learn Of sage Trophonius, whose prophetic cell Thou wouldst descend. An architect divine, He for the Delphians rais'd their Pythian fane. His recompense imploring from the god, This gracious answer from the god he drew: âWhen thrice my chariot hath its circle run, âThe prime reward, a mortal can obtain, âTrophonius, shall be thine.â Apollo thrice His circle ran; behold Trophonius dead. With prophecy his spirit was endu'd, But where abiding in concealment long The destinies envelop'd. Lo! a dearth Afflicts BÅotia. Messengers address The Delphian pow'r for succour. He enjoins Their care throughout Lebadian tracts to seek Oracular Trophonius. Long they roam In fruitless search; at last a honey'd swarm Before them flies; they follow, and attain A cave. Their leader enters, when a voice, Revealing there the deity, suggests Cure to their wants, and knowledge of his will How to be worshipp'd in succeeding times. To him the name of Jupiter is giv'n. He to the fatal sisters hath access; Sees Clotho's awful distaff; sees the thread Of human life by Lachesis thence drawn; Sees Atropos divide, with direful shears, The slender line. But rueful is the mode Of consultation, though from peril free, Within his dreary cell. In thy behalf Thou mayst a faithful substitute appoint. By Horomazes, no, exclaims the chief! It is the cause of empire, from his post Compels the Persian leader; none but he Shall with your god confer. Transactions past To Hegesistratus he now details, His heart unfolding, nor conceals th' event In Asia's camp, when Aemnestus bold, The Spartan legate, prompted, as by heav'n, Him singled out the victim to atone The death of Sparta's king. Their changing course Of navigation now suspends their words. Against the influx of Cephissus, down Lebadian vales in limpid flow convey'd, The rowers now are lab'ring. O'er their heads Hudge alders weave their canopies, and shed Disparted moonlight through the lattic'd boughs; Where Zephyr plays, and whisp'ring motion breathes Among the pliant leaves. Now roseate tincts Begin to streak the orient verge of heav'n, Foretok'ning day. The son of Gobryas lands, Where in soft murmur down a channell'd slope The stream Hercyna, from Trophonian groves, Fresh bubbling meets Cephissus. He ascends With all his train. Th' inclosure, which begirds The holy purlieus, through a portal, hung With double valves on obelisks of stone, Access afforded to the steps of none But suppliants. Hegesistratus accosts One in pontific vesture station'd there: Priest of BÅotia's oracle most fam'd, Dismiss all fear. Thy country's guardian hail, This mighty prince, Mardonius. He preserves Inviolate her fanes; her willing spears All range beneath his standards. To confer With your Trophonius, lo! he comes with gifts, Surpassing all your treasur'd wealth can boast. His hours are precious, nor admit delay; Accept his sumptuous off'rings, and commence The ceremonials due. At first aghast The holy man survey'd the giant guard. Soon admiration follow'd at thy form, Mardonius. Low in stature, if compar'd With those unshapen savages, sublime Thou trod'st in majesty of mien, and grace Of just proportion. Last the gems and gold, Bright vases, tripods, images and crowns, The presents borne by those gigantic hands, With fascinating lustre fix'd the priest To gaze unsated on the copious store. Pass through, but unaccompany'd, he said, Illustrious Persian. Be th' accepted gifts Deposited within these holy gates. He leads the satrap to a grassy mount, Distinct with scatter'd plantains. Each extends O'er the smooth green his mantle brown of shade. Of marble white an edifice rotund, In all th' attractive elegance of art, Looks from the summit, and invites the feet Of wond'ring strangers to ascend. The prince, By his conductor, is instructed thus: Observe yon dome. Thou first must enter there Alone, there fervent in devotion bow Before two statues; one of Genius good, Of Fortune fair the other. At the word Mardonius enters. Chance directs his eye To that expressive form of Genius good, Whose gracious lineaments, sedately sweet, Recall Masistius to the gloomy chief. O melancholy! who can give thee praife? Not sure the gentle; them thy weight o'erwhelms. But thou art wholesome to intemp'rate minds, In vain by wisdom caution'd. In the pool Of black adversity let them be steep'd, Then pride, and lust, and fury thou dost tame. So now Mardonius, by thy pow'r enthrall'd, Sighs in these words humility of grief. If heav'n, relenting, will to me assign A Genius good, he bears no other name Than of Masistius. Oh! thou spirit bless'd, (For sure thy virtue dwells with endless peace) Canst thou, her seat relinquishing awhile, Unseen, or visible, protect thy friend In this momentous crisis of his fate; Or wilt thou, if permitted? Ah! no more Think of Mardonius fierce, ambitious, proud, But as corrected by thy precepts mild; Who would forego his warmest hopes of same, Of pow'r and splendour, gladly to expire, If so the myriads trusted to his charge He might preserve, nor leave whole nations sall'n, A prey to vultures on these hostile plains. Come, and be witness to the tears which flow, Sure tokens of sincerity in me, Not us'd to weep; who, humbled at thy loss, Melt like a maiden, of her love bereav'd By unrelenting death. My demon kind, Do thou descend, and Fortune will pursue Spontaneous and auspicious on her wheel A track unchang'd. Here turning, he adores Her flatt'ring figure, and forsakes the dome. Along Hercyna's bank they now proceed, To where the river parts. One channel holds A sluggish, creeping water, under vaults Of ebon shade, and soporific yew, The growth of ages on the level line Of either joyless verge. The satrap here, Nam'd and presented by his former guide, A second priest receives, conductor new Through night-resembling shadows, which obscure The sleepy stream, unmoving to the sight, Or moving mute. A fountain they approach, One of Hercyna's sources. From the pores Of spongy rock an artificial vase Of jetty marble in its round collects The slow-distilling moisture. Hence the priest A brimming chalice to Mardonius bears, Whom in these words he solemnly accosts: This fount is nam'd of LethÃ¨. Who consults Our subterranean deity, must quaff Oblivion here of all preceding thoughts, Sensations, and affections. Reach the draught; If such oblivious sweets this cup contains, I gladly grasp it, cries the chief, and drinks. Ascending thence, a mazy walk they tread, Where all the season's florid children shew Their gorgeous rayment, and their odours breathe Unspent; while musical in murmur flows Fast down a steep declivity of bed Hercyna, winding in a channel new, Apparent often to the glancing eye Through apertures, which pierce the loaden boughs Of golden fruit Hesperian, and th' attire Of myrtles green, o'ershadowing the banks. In alabaster's variegated hues, To bound the pleasing avenue, a fane Its symmetry discover'd on a plat, Thick-set with roses, which a circling skreen Of that fair ash, where cluster'd berries glow, From ruffling gusts defended. Thither speeds Mardonius, there deliver'd to a third Religious minister supreme. Two youths, In snow-like vesture, and of lib'ral mien, Sons of Lebadian citizens, attend, Entit'led Mercuries. The seer address'd The Persian warrior: In this mansion pure MnemosynÃ¨ is worshipp'd; so in Greece The pow'r of memory is styl'd. Advance, Invoke her aid propitious to retain Whate'er by sounds, or visions, in his cave The prophet god reveals. The chief comply'd; The hallow'd image he approach'd, and spake: Thou art indeed a goddess, I revere. Now to Mardonius, if some dream or sign Prognosticate success, and thou imprint The admonitions of unerring heav'n In his retentive mind; this arm, this sword Shall win thy further favour to record His name and glory on the rolls of time. This said, with lighter steps he quits the sane. The Mercuries conduct him to a bath, Fed from Hercyna's fairer, second source, In shade sequester'd close. While there his limbs Are disarray'd of armour, to assume A civil garment, soon as spotless streams Have purify'd his frame; the priest, who stands Without, in ecstacy of joy remarks The rich Mardonian off'rings on their way, By servitors transported to enlarge The holy treasure. Instant he prepares For sacrifice. A sable ram is slain. Fresh from ablution, lo! Mardonius comes In linen vesture, fine and white, as down Of Paphian doves. A sash of tincture bright, Which rivall'd Flora's brilliancy of dye, Engirds his loins; majestical his brows A wreath sustain; Lebadian sandals ease His steps. Exchanging thus his martial guise, Like some immortal, of a gentler mold Than Mars, he moves. So PhÅbus, when he sets, Lav'd by the nymphs of Tethys in their grot Of coral after his diurnal toil, Repairs his splendours, and his rosy track Of morn resumes. With partial eyes the priest Explores the victim's entrails, and reports Each sign auspicious with a willing tongue; Then to Mardonius: Thee, BÅotia's friend, Magnificently pious to her gods, Thee I pronounce a votary approv'd By this BÅotian deity. Now seek In confidence the cavern. But the rites Demand, that first an image thou approach, Which none, but those in purity of garb, None, but accepted suppliants of the god, Can lawfully behold. Above the bath A rock was hollow'd to an ample space; Thence issued bubbling waters. See, he said, The main Hercynian fount, whose face reflects Yon DÃ¦dal?an workmanship, the form Trophonius bears. Adore that rev'rend beard, The twisted serpents round that awful staff, Those looks, which pierce the mysteries of fate. Next through a winding cavity and vast He guides the prince along a mossy vault, Rough with protuberant and tortuous roots Of ancient woods, which, clothing all above, In depth shoot downward equal to their height; Suspended lamps, with livid glympse and faint, Direct their darkling passage. Now they reach The further mouth unclosing in a dale Abrupt; there shadow, never-fleeting, rests. Rude-featur'd crags, o'erhanging, thence expel The blaze of noon. Beneath a frowning clift A native arch, of altitude which tempts The soaring eagle to construct his nest, Expands before an excavation deep, Unbowelling the hill. On either side This gate of nature, hoary sons of time, Enlarg'd by ages to portentous growth, Impenetrable yews augment the gloom. In height two cubits, on the rocky floor A parapet was rais'd of marble white, In circular dimension; this upholds The weight of polish'd obelisks, by zones Of brass connected, ornamental fence. A wicket opens to th' advancing prince; Steps moveable th' attentive priest supplies; By whom instructed, to the awful chasm Below, profound but narrow, where the god His inspiration breathes, th' intrepid son Of Gobryas firm descends. His nether limbs Up to the loins he plunges. Downward drawn, As by a whirlpool of some rapid flood, At once the body is from sight conceal'd. Entranc'd he lies in subterranean gloom, Less dark than superstition. She, who caus'd His bold adventure, with her wonted fumes Of perturbation from his torpid state Awakes him; rather in a dream suggests That he is waking. On a naked bank He seems to stand; before him sleeps a pool, Edg'd round by desert mountains, in their height Obscuring heav'n. Without impulsive oars, Without a sail, spontaneous flies a bark Above the stagnant surface, which, untouch'd, Maintains its silence. On the margin rests The skiff, presenting to the hero's view An aged fire, of penetrating ken, His weight inclining on an ebon staff, With serpents wreath'd, who, beck'ning, thus began: If, seed of Gobryas, thou wouldst know thy fate, Embark with me; Trophonius I am call'd. Th' undaunted chief obeys. In flight more swift Than eagles, swiftest of the feather'd kind, Th' unmoving water's central spot they gain. At once its bosom opens; down they sink In depth to equal that immane descent Of Hercules to Pluto, yet perform, As in a moment, their portentous way. Around, above, the liquid mass retires, In concave huge suspended, nor bedews Their limbs, or garments. Two stupendous valves Of adamant o'er half the bottom spread; Them with his mystic rod the prophet smites. Self-lifted, they a spacious grot expose, Whose pointed spar is tipt with dancing light, Beyond PhÅbean clear. The Persian looks; Intelligent he looks. Words, names and things, Recurring, gather on his anxious mind; When he, who seems Trophonius: Down this cave None, but the gods oracular, may pass. Here dwell the fatal Sisters; at their toil The Destinies thou see'st. The thread new-drawn Is thine, Mardonius. Instantly a voice, Which shakes the grot, and all the concave round, Sounds Aemnestus. Swift the direful shears The line dissever, and Mardonius, whirl'd Back from Trophonian gloom, is found supine Within the marble parapet, which fenc'd The cavern's mouth. The watchful priest conducts The agitated satrap, mute and sad, Back to MnemosynÃ¨'s abode. His eyes Are sternly fix'd. Now, prince, the seer began, Divulge, whatever thou hast heard and seen Before this goddess. Priest, he said, suspend Thy function now importunate. Remove. The seer withdrawn, the Persian thus alone: Then be it so. To luxury and pow'r, Magnificence and pleasure, I must bid Farewell. Leonidas let Greece extol, Me too shall Persia. Goddess, to thy charge A name, so dearly purchas'd, I consign. This said, in haste his armour he resumes. Not as Leonidas compos'd, yet brave Amid the gloom of trouble, he prefers Death to dishonour. O'er the holy ground He pensive treads, a parallel to Saul, Return'd from Endor's necromantic cell In sadness, still magnanimously firm Ne'er to survive his dignity, but face Predicted ruin, and, in battle slain, Preserve his fame. Mardonius finds the gates; His friends rejoins; glides down Cephissian floods; CopÃ¦Ã¦'s lake repasses; and is lodg'd In his own tent by midnight. Sullen there He sits; disturb'd, he shuns repose; access Forbids to all: but Lamachus intrudes, Nefarious counsellor, in fell device Surpassing fellest tyrants. Now hath night Upcall'd her clouds, black signal for the winds To burst their dungeons; cataracts of rain Mix with blue fires; th' ethereal concave groans; Stern looks Mardonius on the daring Greek, Who, in his wiles confiding, thus began: Supreme o'er nations numberless in arms, Sole hope of Asia, thy return I greet With joy. Thy absence hath employ'd my soul To meditate the means, the certain means For thee to prosper. Lo! the active son Of Neocles, who keeps th' OetÃ¦an pass, Lo! Aristides in the camp of Greece, Remain thy only obstacles. Her pow'r, Of them depriv'd, would moulder and disperse, Devoid of counsel, with an edgless sword. Uncommon danger stimulates the wise To search for safety through uncommon paths, Much more, when pow'r, when empire and renown, Hang on a crisis. If a serpent's guile Behind the pillows of such foes might lurk; If darting thence, his unsuspected sting Might pierce their bosoms; if the ambient air Could by mysterious alchymy be chang'd To viewless poison, and their cups infect With death; such help would policy disdain? Hast thou not hardy and devoted slaves? Try their fidelity and zeal. No life Can be secure against a daring hand. Two Grecian deaths confirm thee lord of Greece. He ceas'd, expecting praise; but honour burns Fierce in the satrap's elevated soul: Dar'st thou suggest such baseness to the son Of Gobryas? furious he exalts his voice; Guards, seize and strangle this pernicious wolf. Time but to wonder at his sudden fate The ready guards afford him, and the wretch Fit retribution for his crimes receives. This act of eastern equity expels The satrap's gloom. Now, Grecian gods, he cries, Smile on my justice. From th' assassin's point I guard your heroes. By yourselves I swear, My preservation, or success, assur'd By such unmanly turpitude I spurn. His mind is cheer'd. A tender warmth succeeds, Predominant in am'rous, eastern hearts, A balm to grief, and victor mild of rage. The midnight hour was past, a season dear To softly-tripping Venus. Through a range Of watchful eunuchs in apartments gay He seeks the female quarter of his tent, Which, like a palace of extent superb, Spreads on the field magnificence. Soft lutes, By snowy fingers touch'd, sweet-warbled song From ruby lips, which harmonize the air Impregnated with rich PanchÃ¦an scents, Salute him ent'ring. Gentle hands unclasp His martial harness, in a tepid bath Lave and perfume his much-enduring limbs. A couch is strewn with roses; he reclines In thinly-woven Taffeta. So long In pond'rous armour cas'd, he scarcely feels The light and loose attire. Around him smile Circassian Graces, and the blooming flow'rs Of beauty cull'd from ev'ry clime to charm. Lo! in transcending ornament of dress A fair-one all-surpassing greets the chief; But pale her lip, and wild her brilliant eye: Nam'd from Bethulia, where I drew my breath, I, by a father's indigence betray'd, Became thy slave; yet noble my descent From Judith ever-fam'd, whose beauty sav'd Her native place. Indignant I withstood Thy passion. Gentle still a master's right Thou didst forbear, and my reluctant charms Leave unprophan'd by force. Repuls'd, thy love Grew cold. Too late contemplating thy worth, I felt a growing flame, but ne'er again Could win thy favour. In the Haram's round Disconsolate, neglected, I have walk'd; Have seen my gay companions to thy arms Preferr'd, professing passion far unlike To mine, Mardonius. Now despair suggests To give thee proof of undissembled truth, Which no neglect hath cool'd. To thy success, Thy glory, my virginity is vow'd. In this bright raiment, with collected pow'rs Of beauty, I at Aristides' feet Will throw me prostrate. To th' alluring face Of my progenitrix a victim fell Th' Assyrian captain, Holofernes proud; So shall thy foe of Athens fall by mine. The meritorious and heroic deed Soon will erase the transitory stain. O! if successful, let Bethulia hope For thy reviving love. Mardonius starts In dubious trouble. Whether to chastise So fierce a spirit, or its zeal admire, He hesitates. Compassion for the sex At length prevails, suggesting this reply: Fell magnanimity! enormous proof Of such intemp'rate passion! I forgive While I reject thy proffer'd crime, although The deed might fix my glory and success; And in return for thy prepos'trous love Will safe replace thee in thy native seat With gifts to raise from indigence thy house. But never, never from this hour will view Thy face again, Bethulia. Eunuchs, hear; Remove, conceal this woman from my sight. No, thou inhuman, thus Bethulia wild: This shall remove for ever from thy sight A woman scorn'd, and terminate her pains. She said, and struck a poniard through her heart. With shrieks the Haram sounds; th' afflicted fair, The eunuchs shudder; when the satrap thus: Is this another black portent of ill, Stern Horomazes? or is this my crime? No, thou art just. My conscious spirit feels Thy approbation of Mardonius now. But from his breast the dire event expels All soft and am'rous cares. His vast command, His long inaction, and the dread of shame Recur. He quits the chamber; to his own Repairing, summons Mindarus, and firm In aspect speaks: The morning soon will dawn. Draw down our slingers, archers, and the skill'd In flying darts to line th' Asopian brink; Thence gall the Grecians, whose diurnal wants That flood relieves. Then Mindarus: O chief, This instant sure intelligence is brought, That from the isthmus, to supply their camp, A convoy, rich in plenty, is descry'd Advancing tow'rds CithÃ¦ron's neighb'ring pass. Mardonius quick: No moment shall be lost. Bid Tiridates with five thousand horse Possess that pass, and, pouring on the plain, Secure the precious store. This said, he seeks A short repose, and Mindarus withdraws. In arms anon to paragon the morn, The morn new-rising, whose vermillion hand Draws from the bright'ning front of heav'n serene The humid curtains of tempestuous night, Mardonius mounts his courser. On his bank The godlike figure soon Asopus views. End of the Twenty-seventh Book. BOOK the Twenty-Eighth. While lamentation for Masistius dead Depress'd the Persians, undisturb'd the Greeks To all their camp refreshment had deriv'd From clear Asopus. To th' accustom'd edge Of his abounding flood they now resort. Stones, darts and arrows from unnumber'd ranks, Along the margin opposite dispos'd By Mindarus, forbid access. Repulse Disbands the Greeks. Exulting, he forgets Cleora; active valour in his breast Extinguishes the embers, cherish'd long By self-tormenting memory, and warmth Of fruitless passion. Present too his chief, His friend and kinsman, from a fiery steed Mardonius rules and stimulates the fight, Like Boreas, riding on a stormy cloud, Whence issue darts of light'ning, mix'd with hail In rattling show'rs. The enemies dispers'd, Embolden Mindarus to ford the stream. In guidance swift of cavalry expert, With unresisted squadrons he careers Along the field. Inviolate the flood He guards; each hostile quarter he insults. Now Gobryas' son, unfetter'd from the bonds Of superstitious terrors, joyful sees In Mindarus a new Masistius rise; Nor less the tidings Tiridates sends, Who in CithÃ¦ron's passes hath despoil'd The slaughter'd foes, inspire the gen'ral's thoughts, Which teem with arduous enterprise. The camp He empties all; beneath whose forming host The meadow sounds. The native Persians face Laconia's station, Greek allies oppose Th' Athenian. All the force of Thebes array'd Envenom'd Leontiades commands. Greece in her lines sits tranquil; either host Expects the other. By their augurs still Restrain'd, they shun the interdicted ford. But of the river's plenteous stream depriy'd By Mindarus, the Grecians fear a dearth Of that all-cheering element. A rill Flows from a distant spring, Gargaphia nam'd, Their sole resource. Nor dread of other wants Afflicts them less; their convoy is o'erpow'r'd By Tiridates. Anxious all exhaust A night disturb'd; the bravest grieve the most, Lest through severe necessity they quit Inglorious their position. Morning shines; When frequent signals from th' external guards, Near and remote, successive rise. To arms All rush. Along the spacious public way From Megara, obscuring dust ascends. The sound of trampling hoofs, and laden wheels, With shouts of multitude, is heard. Behold, Forth from the cloud, a messenger of joy, Sicinus breaks, of bold auxiliar bands Forerunner swift, and unexpected aid In copious stores, at Megara's wide port New-landed from ThermopylÃ¦. The camp Admits, and hails in rapturous acclaim EubÅan standards, PotidÃ¦a's ranks, The laurell'd priest and hero, Timon sage, Th' ennobled heir of Lygdamis, and thee, Melissa's brother, great OÃ¯leus' son, Friend of Leonidas, thee dear to all, O brave, and gen'rous Medon! From their tents The chiefs assemble, when Sicinus spake: Pausanius, gen'ral of united Greece, Accept these ample succours from the hand Of provident Themistocles. Possess'd Of Oeta's passes, he the Persian host Now with impenetrable toils besets Like beasts of prey, entangled by the skill Of some experienc'd hunter. Thou receive, Just Aristides, from Timothea's love, A suit of armour new, in Chalcis fram'd, Without luxuriant ornament, or gold. The shield, an emblem of thy soul, displays Truth, equity and wisdom, hand in hand. This for her children, and thy own, consign'd To her EubÅan roof and pious care, She bids thee lift and conquer. Thou restore The little exiles in their native homes To dwell in peace. Her gift, she adds, derives Its only value from the wearer's worth. In smiles, like Saturn at the tribute pure Of fruits and flow'rs in singleness of heart Paid by religion of the golden age, Timothea's gift the righteous man receives, Not righteous more than practic'd to endure Heroic labours, soon by matchless deeds To justify the giver. He began: Confederated warriors, who withstand A tyrant's pow'r, unanimous confess Your debt to great Themistocles, the lord Of all-admir'd Timothea. He and I Evince the fruits of concord. Ancient foes, Through her united, cheerful we sustain Our public charge. From gen'ral union Greece Expects her safety. Him success hath crown'd In arms and counsel; whether on the main His naval flag he spread, or shook the land With his triumphant step. O, hero-born Pausanias! glowing with Herculean blood, Now under thee let Aristides hope To share success, nor tarnish with disgrace His armour new. Behold, yon river gleams With hostile arms. Those standards on the left, Well-known to Attic eyes, are proudly borne By native Medes and Persians. Treach'rous Thebes Lifts her Cadm?an banner on the right. A second time Mardonius forms his host To proffer battle. He, perhaps, may ford Asopus, which Tisamenus, the learn'd In divination, hath forbid our steps To pass. Thy former numbers swift arrange. New from a march let these auxiliars guard The camp. To him Pausanias thus apart: Athenian, hear: Your citizens are vers'd In this Barbarian warfare, yet unknown To us. Let Spartans and Athenians change Their station. You, an adversary try'd At Marathon, and foil'd, will best oppose. To vanquish Grecians we accustom'd long Will yon BÅotians and Thessalians face. Such is my will. Concise the Attic sage: Thou hast commanded what my willing thoughts Themselves devis'd, but waited first to hear. Well canst thou sight, Pausanias. I will strive To imitate thy deeds and thy renown, On whose increase our liberty and laws Depend. This said, they part. Behind the rear Soon from the left th' Athenians, from the right The Spartans file. Their stations they exchange, Not by Mardonius unperceiv'd. He moves His Medes and Persians to the post of Thebes, Whence still the Spartan phalanx they confront, The Thebans still th' Athenian. This observ'd, Pausanias swift to Aristides sends Strict charge his old position to resume. Now indignation high through all the tribes Of Athens rages. Noble pride, and sense Of just desert, in exclamation fierce Break from th' exalted populace, who claim Their soil for parent. Gods! from wing to wing Must we like servile mercenary bands, Like Helots, slaves to LacedÃ¦mon born, Be hurry'd thus obsequious to controul From an imperious Spartan? Tegea first Contested our prerogative. The pride Of Sparta next removes us from the post, Assign'd by public judgment; we comply. Must we at her contemptuous nod resume The station we forsook? Defending Greece, Ourselves meanwhile deserted and betray'd, Twice have we lost our city. What is left Of our abandon'd residence, but dust? Let Greece defend herself. Let us remove For the last time our standards, hoist our sails, Our floating empire fix on distant shores, Our household gods, our progeny, and name, On some new soil establish, sure to find None so ingrate as this. The Athenians thus Swell with ingenuous ire, as ocean boils, Disturb'd by Eurus, and the rude career Of Boreas, threat'ning furious to surmount All circumscription. But as oft a cloud, Distilling gentle moisture as it glides, Dissolves the rigour of their boist'rous wings, Till o'er the main serenity returns; So from the mouth of Aristides fall Composing words. Insensibly he sooths Their justly-irritated minds, and calms Their just resentment. Righteousness and truth, How prevalent your efforts, when apply'd By placid wisdom! In these strains he spake: Ye men of Athens, at Laconia's call To meet the flow'r of Asia's host in fight Do ye repine? A station, which implies Pre-eminence of Attic worth, a task Of all most glorious, which the martial race Of Sparta shuns, and you should covet most, Ye Marathonian victors? In the sight Of Greece, who trembles at a Median garb, You are preferr'd for valour. Arms the same, The same embroider'd vestment on their limbs Effeminate, the same unmanly souls, Debas'd by vices and monarchal rule, The Medes retain, as when their vanquish'd ranks Fled heretofore. With weapons often try'd, With confidence by victories increas'd, Not now for liberty and Greece alone You march to battle; but to keep unspoil'd Your trophies won already, and the name, Which Marathon and Salamis have rais'd, Preserve unstain'd; that men may ever say, Not through your leaders, not by fortune there You triumph'd, but by fortitude innate, And lib'ral vigour of Athenian blood. He said and march'd. All follow mute through love Of Aristides, inexpressive love, Which melts each bosom. Solemn they proceed, Though lion-like in courage, at his call Meek and obedient, as the fleecy breed To wonted notes of Pan's conducting pipe. Arriv'd, disbanded, in their sep'rate tents Cecropia's tribes exhaust a tedious night, Unvisited by sleep. The morning breaks; Instead of joy to gratulate her light The tone of sadness from dejected hearts, Combining sighs and groans in murmur deep, Alarms the leader. Aristides, shew Thy countenance amongst us, hasty spake The warrior-poet ent'ring: All thy camp Enthusiastic sorrow hath o'erwhelm'd, And ev'ry heart unbrac'd. By earliest dawn Each left his restless couch. Their first discourse Was calm, and fill'd with narratives distinct Of thy accomplishments, and worth. At length A soldier thus in agitation spake: âYet, O most excellent of Gods! O Jove! âThis is the man, we banish'd! In thy sight âThe most excelling man, whose sole offence âWas all-transcending merit, from his home âOur impious votes expell'd, by envy's spight âSeduc'd. We drove him fugitive through Greece; âWhere still he held ungrateful Athens dear, âFor whose redemption from her sloth he rous'd âAll Greece to arms.â The soldier clos'd in floods Of anguish. Instant through the concourse ran Contagious grief; as if the fiend Despair, From his black chariot, wheeling o'er their heads In clouds of darkness, dropp'd his pois'nous dews Of melancholy down to chill the blood, Unnerve the limbs, and fortitude dissolve. Speed, Aristides. By th' immortal pow'rs! The feeblest troop of Persians in this hour Might overcome the tame, desponding force Of thy dear country, mistress long confess'd Of eloquence and arts, of virtue now Through thy unerring guidance. Here the sage: With-hold thy praise, good Ãschylus-Be swift, Arrange my fellow citizens in arms Beneath each ensign of the sev'ral tribes. I will appear a comforter, a friend, Their public servant. Ãschylus withdraws. Soon Aristides, in his armour new, Timothea's gift, advances from his tent. Should from his throne th' Omnipotent descend In visitation of the human race, While dreading his displeasure; as to earth All heads would bend in reverential awe, Contrite and conscious of their own misdeeds; So look th' Athenians, though in all the pomp Of Mars array'd, and terrible to half The world in battle. Down their corslets bright Tears trickle, tears of penitence and shame, To see their injur'd patriot chief assume In goodness heav'n's whole semblance, as he moves Observant by, and through the weeping ranks From man to man his lib'ral hand extends, Consoling. No resentment he could shew, Who none had felt. Ascending now on high, He thus address'd the penitential throng. Rate not too high my merit, nor too low Your own depreciate. Error is the lot Of man; but lovely in the eye of heav'n Is sense of error. Better will you sight, As better men from these auspicious tears, Which evidence your worth, and please the gods. With strength and valour, equity of mind Uniting doubles fortitude. Your wives, Your progeny and parents, laws and rites, Were ne'er so well secur'd. The warlike bard Rose next: Requested by the sev'ral tribes, In their behalf I promise to thy rule All acquiescence. Bid them fight, retreat, Maintain, or yield a station; bid them face Innumerable foes, surmount a foss Deep as the sea, or bulwarks high as rocks; Subordination, vigilance, contempt Of toil and death, thy dictates shall command. Th' OÃ¯lean hero, Timon, and the seed Of Lygdamis, are present, who encamp'd Among th' Athenians. They admire the chief, Nor less the people. While the term of morn Was passing thus, a summons to his tent Calls Aristides. Aemnestus there Salutes him: Attic friend, a new event In Sparta's quarter is to thee unknown; From me accept th' intelligence. The sun Was newly ris'n, when o'er th' Asopian flood An Eastern herald pass'd. BÃ¨hind him tow'r'd A giant-siz'd Barbarian. He approach'd Our camp; before Pausanias brought, he spake: âI am Briareus, of Mardonian guards âCommander. Through my delegated mouth âThus saith the son of Gobryas: I have heard âAmong the Greeks your prowess vaunted high, âYe men of Sparta, that in martial ranks âYou either kill, or perish; but I find, âFame is a liar. I expected long, âYou would defy me on the field of war. âHave I not seen you shift from wing to wing, âThe task imposing on th' Athenians twice âTo face the Medes and Persians; while yourselves âSought with our servants to contend in arms, âYe brave in name alone! Since you decline âTo challenge us, we, prime of eastern blood, âWith equal numbers challenge you to prove, âThat you possess, what rumour hath proclaim'd, âThe boldest hearts in Greece. Acknowledge else âYour boasted valour bury'd in the grave âWith your Leonidas, o'erthrown and slain.â Pausanias gave no answer, not through fear, But humour torpid and morose, which wrapp'd In clouds of scorn his brow. Consulting none, With silent pride the giant he dismiss'd. The challenger, in triumph turning back, Repass'd the river. Aemnestus paus'd; A second messenger appear'd. Behold, In blooming vigour, flush'd by rapid haste, Young Menalippus, from the rev'rend seer Megistias sprung. Athenian chief, he said, Bring down thy active, missile-weapon'd troops; On their immediate help Pausanias calls. A cloud of hostile cavalry invests Laconia's quarter. Javelins, arrows, darts, In sheets discharg'd, have choak'd our last resource, Gargaphia's fountain, and our heavy bands Perplex and harrass. Aristides hears, And issues swift his orders, while the youth Continues thus: Thou knew'st of old my sire, Who at ThermopylÃ¦ expir'd. The just Consort together. Aristides thus: Ingenuous youth, for Greece thy father bled A spotless victim, but for ever lives Companion with Leonidas in fame. By heav'n protected, thou shalt live to see Their death aton'd; the period is not far. Come on; my force is ready. Medon arms With Haliartus, once the shepherd-swain In Oeta's pass to Menalippus known, Whom both embrace with gratulation kind. All march, but reach not Sparta's distant wing, Before the Persians, sated with success, Fil'd back to join Mardonius. Secret he Was communing with Mirzes, most renown'd Among the Magi. Thus the satrap clos'd: Through each occurrence undisguis'd, O sage! My circumstantial narrative hath run, From where I enter'd first Trophonian ground, Till my descent and vision in the cave. Speak frankly, Mirzes-nor believe thy words, Whatever black presages they contain, Subjoin'd to all Trophonius hath foretold, Can change my firm resolves, or blunt my sword. Solicitude for Persia to excess Misled thee, satrap, to that graven god, Rejoins the Magus, where, if ought besides The craft of Grecian, mercenary priests, It was the demon Arimanius rul'd. He long hath prompted that El?an seer, Who blunts thy sword by divination false. What thou dost vision call was empty dream; Imagination heated, and disturb'd, A texture wild and various, intermix'd With ill-match'd images of things, which last Oppress'd thy mind. Thy own distemper fram'd Th' unreal grot, where Destinies of air In apparition cut thy vital thread; Their act was thine, the oracle thy own, All vague creation of thy erring sleep. Briareus enters. At his tidings glad, Which ostentation sounded, thus exults Mardonius: Sayst thou, LacedÃ¦mon's chief Was mute, when my defiance shook his ear? Hence to the winds, ye auguries and signs! Ye dreams and mysteries of Greece, avaunt! Thou, Horomazes, not in marble fanes, Nor woods oracular, and caves, dost dwell. It is the pow'r of evil there misguides Insensate mortals, and misguided me. O, Artemisia! now shall Gobryas' son Look only, where no mystery can lurk, On ev'ry manly duty. Nothing dark The tracks of honour shades. To chiefs select, Greek and Barbarian summon'd, he reveals His fix'd resolves in council. They disperse To execute his will. Among the rest Young Alexander, Macedonia's lord, Speeds to his quarters in the solemn bow'r Of DircÃ¨. There Mardonius had decreed A cenotaph of marble, newly-rais'd To his deplor'd Masistius. There the queen Of Macedon, PhÅbean Timon's child, Bright Amarantha, like an ev'ning bird, Whose trill delights a melancholy grove, Oft with harmonious skill in Delphian strains, Th' ingenuous practice of her maiden days, Sung of her father, and Masistius good, That friend, that known protector. She her lute Was now in cadence with DircÃ¦an rills Attuning. Vocal melody she breath'd, Which at another season might have won Her lord from sadness. Sighing, he her song Thus interrupts: Ah! consort dear, as fair, I come from Persia's council; where the son Of Gobryas, urg'd by fear of sudden want Through his wide host, nor animated less By Spartan silence at the challenge proud His herald bore, determines to reject The augur's warnings. O'er the stream he means To lead th' embattled nations, and surprise Ere dawn, at least assail the camp of Greece In ev'ry station. If she quits her lines, Then will his num'rous cavalry surround Her heavy phalanx on the level space. O that my ancestor had never left His Grecian home in Argos, nor acquir'd Emathia's crown! I never then compell'd, Had borne reluctant arms against a race By friendship link'd, affinity, and blood, With me and mine. What horror! cries the queen, While fear surmises, that my husband's sword May blindly cut my father's vital thread. But not alone such parricide to shun Should wake thy efforts. Alexander, no; Thou must do more. Our mutual words recall, When thou to Athens by Mardonius sent Didst from thy fruitless ambassy rejoin Me in TrachiniÃ¦; whence the Barb'rous chief Renew'd his march to lay Cecropian domes In fresh destruction. âWhat a lot is mine, âThou saidst? If Xerxes triumph, I become âA slave in purple. Should the Greeks prevail, âShould that Euboean conqueror, the son âOf Neocles be sent th' Athenian scourge.... I interrupted thus: âAwhile, dear lord, âWe must submit to wear the galling mask, âNecessity imposes. New events âAre daily scatter'd by the restless palm âOf fortune. Some will prove propitious. Wise, âTo all benignant, Aristides serv'd âBy us in season will befriend our state.â Behold that season come; let Grecian blood, Which warms thy veins, inspire thy prudent tongue This night th' Athenian hero to apprise Of all these tidings. Thus secure the Greeks Against surprisal; timely thus oblige The first of men, and magnify thy name In Greece for ages. Here the youthful king: Though by oppressive Xerxes forc'd to war, Shall I abuse the confidence repos'd By great Mardonius, qualify'd to win Regard at first, which intercourse augments? I will do all by honour's rules allow'd, Will act a neutral part, withdraw my troops, Ev'n at the hazard of my crown and life, If such my queen's injunction. Ah! forbear To frown; what means this flushing of thy cheek? Must I betray Mardonius to his foes? She spake abrupt; he started at her look: If forc'd obedience to a tyrant binds, If more, than I, Mardonius holds thy heart, Who has thy dearest confidence abus'd, Thou wilt discredit my accusing tongue. Could from this empty monument the shade Of just Masistius rise, his awful voice Would verify a story, till this hour From thee conceal'd. My virgin hand in blood Of one Barbarian miscreant once I stain'd; Not to pollute my hymeneal state, Nor lay Mardonius gasping at my feet Like Mithridates in the streets of Thebes, This hateful camp for Delphi I forsook, Fled from a lawless and presumptuous flame, Insulting me, thy queen, who boast descent From holy Timon. While for his behoof Collecting Greeks against their country's cause, Thyself was absent, and Mardonius left My only guardian; scorning every tie, His daring importunity of love Assail'd thy consort's ear. What hope, what trust In such Barbarians? All their faith expir'd With good Masistius. Should the Greeks be foil'd, How long will Macedon thy realm, how long Will Amarantha be securely held Against a satrap, whose ungovern'd will May covet both? Of this, O prince, be sure, Her part of shame will Amarantha bear But brief shall be its date. The poniard still, Which once preserv'd my honour, I possess To cut my period of dishonour short. The prince impatient, yet attentive, heard Her words; when thus the measure of his wrath From his full bosom rapidly o'erflow'd. O impious breach of hospitable ties! O violation base of rights and laws, Exacting swift revenge from heav'n and man, From me the first! Unparallel'd in form, O like the sister of thy Delphian god Immaculate! Did sacrilegious hands This pure abode of chastity assail With profanation? Less a friend to Greece, Than foe to false Mardonius, now I go. He said, and order'd forth his swiftest steed. By moon-light, twinkling on a shaded track, He urg'd his secret way beyond the springs Asopian; whence an outlet short and close Through mount CithÃ¦ron to th' adjacent line Of Aristides led. Meantime the sound Of steps advancing Amarantha heard; She heard, and saw Mardonius. He his pace Stopp'd short, inclining with obeisance low His stately frame. Through terror and amaze To earth she rigid grew, of pow'r to fly Depriv'd. He distant spake: Imperial dame, That he offended once, Mardonius makes A penitent confession. O! that fault To no innate discourtesy impute, But Eastern manners, not as Grecian pure; The ignorance which err'd, by thee is chang'd To veneration. From my presence here, Which ne'er before intruded on this seat Of thy retirement, do not too severe A new offence interpret; rest assur'd, A solemn cause impels. He silent waits, Nor moves; till, gliding silently away, Like Dian fair and chaste, but less severe, The queen withdrew, and tow'rds a gallant chief, Perhaps by her devices near his fall, Thus far relented; for the private wrong The frank atonement rais'd a generous sigh; Against the public enemy of Greece, Unquenchable she burn'd. Now left alone, Before the cenotaph he kneel'd and spake: To-morrow, O! to-morrow let my helm Blaze in thy beams auspicious, spirit bright, Whose name adorns this honorary tomb! The weight of Asia's mighty weal, the weight Of fifty myriads on thy friend augments From hour to hour. Yet purg'd of gloomy thoughts, Clear of ambition, save to win the palm Of victory for Xerxes, I approach Thy suppliant. Thou an intercessor pure For me, deceiv'd by Grecian seers and gods, Before the throne of Horomazes stand, That he may bless my standards, if alone To guard so many worshippers, and spread By their success his celebrated name Through each Hesperian clime. Now grant a sign, Masistius, ere thy faithful friend depart, Fix'd, as he is, to vanquish, or to fall. He ceas'd. Quick rapture dims his cheated eyes. He sees in thought a canopy of light, Descending o'er the tomb. In joy he speeds To preparation for the destin'd march. End of the Twenty-eighth Book. BOOK the Twenty-ninth. Among the Greeks their first nocturnal watch Was near its period. From Laconia's wing Return'd, th' Athenian leader thus bespake Sicinus: Worthy of my trust, give ear. Within six hours the army will decamp To chuse a friendlier station; so the chiefs In gen'ral council, as Gargaphia choak'd Withholds her wonted succour, have resolv'd. At Juno's fane, yet undespoil'd, though near PlatÃ¦a's ruins, ev'ry band is charg'd To reassemble.... Suddenly appears A centinel, who speaks: A stranger, near The trenches waits thee; us in peaceful words Saluting, he importunate requires Thy instant presence. Aristides hastes; To whom the stranger: Bulwark of this camp, Hear, credit, weigh, the tidings which I bear. Mardonius, press'd by fear of threat'ning want, At night's fourth watch the fatal stream will pass, Inflexibly determin'd, though forbid By each diviner, to assail your host With all his numbers. I against surprise Am come to warn you; thee alone I trust, My name revealing. I, O man divine! I, who thus hazard both my realm, and life, Am Alexander, Macedonian friend Of Athens. Kindly on a future day Remember me. He said, and spurr'd his steed Back through the op'ning of CithÃ¦ron's hill. By Aristides instantly detach'd, Sicinus calls each leader to attend usanias. Attica's great captain joins The council full. His tidings he relates, Concluding thus with exhortation sage: We destitute of water had resolv'd To change our station. Now without a pause We must anticipate th' appointed hour For this retreat, nor ling'ring tempt the force Of squadrons swift to intercept our march. All move your standards. Let Mardonius bring A host discourag'd by their augur's voice; Who are forbid to pass the fatal stream, But are compell'd by famine and despair To inauspicious battle. We to heav'n Obedient, heav'n's assistance shall obtain. A situation, safeguard to our flanks Against superior and surrounding horse, In sight of burnt PlatÃ¦a, of her fanes Defac'd, and violated gods, I know; There will assure you conquest. All assent. At once the diff'rent Grecians, who compose The center, lift their ensigns. O'er the plain First swiftly tow'rds PlatÃ¦an Juno's dome Speeds Adimantus. In array more slow The rest advance. Cleander guards the rear; Brave youth, whom chance malicious will bereave Of half the laurels to his temples due. Th' Athenians arm delib'rate; in whose train Illustrious Medon ranks a faithful troop, His hundred Locrians. Haliartus there, There Timon's few, but gen'rous Delphians stand, By Aristides all enjoin'd to watch Laconia's host. That sternly-tutor'd race, To passion cold, he knew in action slow, In consultation torpid. Anxious long He waits, and fears the eyelids of the morn, Too soon unclosing, may too much reveal. Sicinus, hast'ning to Laconia's camp, Finds all confus'd, subordination lost In altercation, wond'rous in that breed Of discipline and manners, nor less strange, Than if the laws of nature in the sky Dissolv'd, should turn the moon and planets loose From their accustom'd orbits, to obey The sun no longer. When his first command Pausanias issu'd for the march, nor thought Of disobedience to disturb his pride; One leader, Amompharetus, whose band Of PitanÃ¨ rever'd him, as the first Among the brave, refusal stern oppos'd, Protesting firm, he never would retreat Before Barbarians. Aemnestus swift, Callicrates and others, long approv'd In arms, entreat the Spartan to submit, Nor disconcert the salutary plan Of gen'ral council. Sullen he replies: Not of that council, I will ne'er disgrace The Spartan name. But all the Greeks withdrawn Expect our junction at Saturnia's dome, Callicrates and Aemnestus plead. Would'st thou expose thy countrymen to sace Unaided yonder multitude of Medes, Untry'd by us in combat? Yes, rejoins The pertinacious man, ere yield to flight. His troop applauded. Now contention harsh Resounded high, exhausting precious hours, The Spartan march retarding; when arriv'd Sicinus witness to the wild debate. At length Pausanias knit his haughty brow At Amompharetus, and spake: Weak man, Thou art insane. The chastisement thy due, Our time allows not. Instant march, or stay Behind and perish. In his two-fold grasp The restive Spartan lifting from the ground A pond'rous stone, before the gen'ral's feet Plac'd it, and thus: Against dishonest flight From strangers vile, I rest my suffrage there, Nor will forsake it. To Sicinus turn'd Pausanias: Tell th' Athenians what thou see'st. I by CithÃ¦ron's side to Juno's fane Am hast'ning; charge their phalanx to proceed. Sicinus back to Aristides flies. His ready phalanx from the lines he draws, Wing'd with his horse and bowmen; yet his course Suspends at Sparta's camp. There sullen, fix'd Like some old oak's deep-rooted, knotted trunk, Which hath endur'd the tempest-breathing months Of thrice a hundred winters, yet remains Unshaken, there amidst his silent troop Sat Amompharetus. To him the sage: Unwife, though brave, transgressing all the laws Of discipline, though Spartan born and train'd; Arise, o'ertake thy gen'ral and rejoin. Thy country's mercy by some rare exploit Win to forgive thy capital default, Excess of courage. Where Pausanias, arm'd With pow'r unlimited in war, where all The Spartan captains in persuasion fail'd,â Requir'd not less than Jove himself, or Jove In Aristides to prevail. Uprose The warrior, late inflexible; yet slow, In strictest regularity of march, Led his well-order'd files. Correcting thus The erring Spartan, Aristides swept Across the plain to fill the gen'ral host. Not yet the twilight, harbinger of morn, Had overcome the stars. The Persian scouts, Who rang'd abroad, observing that no sound Was heard, no watch-word through the Grecian lines, Adventur'd nigh, and found an empty space. Swift they appris'd Mardonius, who had form'd His whole array. Encircled by his chiefs Greek and Barbarian, first he gave command, That ev'ry hand provide a blazing torch To magnify his terrors, and with light Facilitate pursuit; then gladsome thus Address'd his friends of Thessaly and Thebes: Now LarissÃ¦an Thorax, and the rest Of Aleuadian race; now Theban lords, Judge of the Spartans justly. Vaunted high For unexampled prowess, them you saw First change their place, imposing on the sons Of Athens twice the formidable task To face my chosen Persians; next they gave To my defiance no reply, and last Are fled before me. Can your augurs shew A better omen, than a foe dismay'd? But, kind allies, to you my friendly care Shall now be prov'd. These thunderbolts of war, As you esteem them, will Mardonius chuse For his opponents. Level your attack Entire against th' Athenians. None I dread; Yet by the sun less terrible to me Is that Pausanias, head of Sparta's race, Than Aristides. Him Masistius lov'd; If you o'erthrow, preserve him; in the name Of your own gods I charge you. Mithra, shine On me no longer, if in grateful warmth Confessing ev'ry benefit receiv'd, I do not clasp that guardian of my friend! Now, Persians, mount your bold NisÃ¦an steeds, Alert your targets grasp, your lances poise; The word is Cyrus. Royal spirit! look On me, deriv'd from thy illustrious blood, Yet not in me illustrious, if this day My hand, or courage faint. Look down on these, Sons of thy matchless veterans. The fire, Which at thy breath o'erspread the vanquish'd East, Light in their offs'pring; that the loud report Of their achievements on Asopian banks, Far as the floods of Ganges may proclaim The western world a vassal to thy throne. He said, and spurr'd his courser. Through the ford He dashes, follow'd by th' impetuous speed Of tall equestrian bands in armour scal'd With gold, on trappings of embroider'd gloss Superbly seated. Persians next and Medes Advance, an infantry select, whose mail Bright-gilt, or silver'd o'er, augments the light Of sparkling brands, innumerably wav'd By nations, plunging through the turbid flood In tumult rude, emblazing, as they pass, The skies, the waters, and with direst howl Distracting both. Like savage wolves they rush, As with ferocious fangs to rend the Greeks, To gnaw their flesh, and satiate in their blood The greedy thirst of massacre. In chief Here Mindarus commands, by Midias join'd And Tiridates, powerless all to curb, Much more to marshal such Barbarian throngs, Which, like a tumbling tide on level strands, When new the moon impels it, soon o'erwhelm'd Th' Asopian mead; or like the mightier surge, When ireful Neptune strikes the ocean's bed Profound. Upheav'd, the bottom lifts and rolls A ridge of liquid mountains o'er th' abodes Of some offending nation; while the heav'ns With coruscation red his brother Jove Inflames, and rocks with thunder's roar the poles. Th' auxiliar Greeks compact and silent march In strength five myriads. In arrangement just The foot by Leontiades, the wings Of horse by Thorax and Emathia's king Were led. Now, long before th' unwieldy mass Of his disorder'd multitude advanc'd, Mardonius, rushing through the vacant lines Of LacedÃ¦mon, tow'rds CithÃ¦ron bent His swift career. Faint rays began to streak The third clear morning of that fruitful month, The last in summer's train. Immortal day! Which all the Muses consecrate to fame. O thou! exalted o'er the laurell'd train, High as the sweet CalliopÃ¨ is thron'd Above her sisters on the tuneful mount, O father, hear! Great Homer, let one ray From thy celestial light an humble son Of thine illuminate; lest freedom mourn Her chosen race dishonour'd in these strains. Thou too, my eldest brother, who enjoy'st The paradise thy genius hath portray'd, Propitious smile. Lend vigour to a Muse, Who in her love of freedom equals thine, But to sustain her labours from thy store Must borrow language, sentiment and verse. CithÃ¦ron's ridge, from where Asopus rose, Stretch'd to PlatÃ¦a, with a southern fence Confining one broad level, which the floods From their Hesperian head in eastward flow Meandring parted. O'er the mountain's foot His course Pausanias destin'd, where the soil Abrupt and stony might the dread career Of Persia's cavalry impede. His ranks, Accompany'd by Tegea's faithful breed, Had measur'd now ten furlongs of their march Half o'er the plain to reach the friendly ground; Then halted near an Eleusinian dome Of Ceres; thence they mov'd, but timely first Were join'd by Amompharetus. At length The chosen track was gain'd. Pausanias cast His eyes below first northward, and survey'd Between the river and his empty camp A blaze involving all the plain. The yell Of mouths Barbarian, of unnumber'd feet Th' impetuous tread, which crush'd the groaning turf, The neigh of horses, and their echoing hoofs, Th' insulting clash of shields and sabres, shook The theatre of mountains; hollow-voic'd, Their cavities rebellow'd, and enlarg'd The hideous sound. His eyes the orient dawn Attracted next. Saturnia's roof he view'd, But distant still, around whose sacred walls The first-departed Grecians stood in arms Beneath wide-floating banners, wish'd more nigh. There was the Genius of PlatÃ¦a seen By fancy's ken, a hov'ring mourner seen, O'er his renown'd, but desolated seat, One mass of ruins mountainous. He mark'd Th' Athenians traversing the meads below In full battalia. Resolute, sedate, Without one shield in disarray, they mov'd To join the gen'ral host. Beyond the stream In prospect rose the battlements of Thebes; Whose sons perfidious, but in battle firm, With phalanges of other hostile Greeks Spread on the bank, and menace to surmount The shallow current for some dire attempt. To Aemnestus, marching by his side, Pausanias turns; the army he commands To halt; while, mast'ring all unmanly fear, His haughty phlegm serenely thus fulfils A leader's function: Spartan, we in vain Precipitate our junction with allies At Juno's distant fane; the hour is past; The Pitan?an mutineer the cause. Seest thou yon Persian squadrons? They precede The whole Barbarian multitude. The storm Is gath'ring nigh; we sep'rate must abide The heavy weight of this unequal shock, Unless th' Athenians, still in sight, impart A present aid. A herald swift he sends To Aristides, with this weighty charge: âAll Greece is now in danger, and the blood âOf Hercules in me. Athenian help âIs wanted here, their missile-weapon'd force.â Last he address'd Tisamenus: Provide The sacrifice for battleâWarriors, form. Slain is the victim; but th' inspecting seer Reveals no sign propitious. Now full nigh The foremost Persian horse discharge around Their javelins, darts, and arrows. Sparta's chief In calm respect of inauspicious heav'n Directs each soldier at his foot to rest The passive shield, submissive to endure Th' assault, and watch a signal from the gods. A second time unfavorable prove The victim's entrails. Unremitted show'rs Of pointed arms distribute wounds and death. Oh! discipline of Sparta! Patient stands The wounded soldier, sees a comrade fall, Yet waits permission from his chief to shield His own, or brother's head. Among the rest Callicrates is pierc'd; a mortal stroke His throat receives. Him celebrate, O muse! Him in historic rolls deliver'd down To admiration of remotest climes Through latest ages. These expiring words Beyond Olympian chaplets him exalt, Beyond his palms in battle: Not to die For Greece, but dying, ere my sword is drawn, Without one action worthy of my name, I grieve. He said, and fainting on the breast Of Aemnestus, breath'd in spouting blood His last, departing thy attendant meet, Leonidas, in regions of the bless'd. A second victim bleeds; the gath'ring foes To multitude are grown; the show'rs of death Increase; then melted into slowing grief Pausanian pride. He, tow'rds the fane remote Of Juno lifting his afflicted eyes, Thus suppliant spake: O Goddess! let my hopes Be not defeated, whether to obtain A victory so glorious, or expire Without dishonour to Herculean blood. Amidst the pray'r Teg?an Chileus, free From stern controul of LacedÃ¦mon's laws, No longer waits inactive; but his band Leads forth, and firmly checks th' insulting foe. The sacrifice is prosp'rous, and the word For gen'ral onset by Pausanias giv'n. Then, as a lion, from his native range Confin'd a captive long, if once his chain He breaks, with mane erect and eyes of fire Asserts his freedom, rushing in his strength Resistless forth; so Sparta's phalanx turns A face tremendous on recoiling swarms Of squadron'd Persians, who to Ceres' fane Are driv'n. But there Mardonius, like the god Of thunders ranging o'er th' ethereal vault Thick clouds on clouds impregnated with storms, His chosen troops embattles. Bows and darts Rejecting, gallantly to combat close They urge undaunted efforts, and to death Their ground maintain, in courage, or in might Not to the Greeks inferior, but in arms, In discipline and conduct. Parties small, Or single warriors, here with vigour wield The battle-ax and sabre; others rush Among the spears, to wrench away, or break By strength of hands, the weapons of their foes. But fiercest was the contest, where sublime The son of Gobryas from a snow-white steed Shot terror. There selected warriors charg'd, A thousand vet'rans, by their fathers train'd, Who shar'd renown with Cyrus. On the right, Close to his gen'ral's side, Briareus grasp'd A studded mace, PangÃ¦us on the left, Nam'd from a Thracian hill. The bristly front Of Sparta's phalanx, with intrepid looks Mardonius fac'd, and thunder'd out these words: Come, twice-defy'd Pausanias, if thou hear'st; Thy Spartan prowess on Mardonius try. Pausanias heard; but shunn'd retorting words, In saturnine disdain laconic thus His men addressing: Yours the soldler's part, The gen'rals mine; advance not, but receive These loose Barbarians on your steady points. Not one of Persia's breed, though early train'd, So strong a javelin as Mardonius lanc'd, Or in its aim so true. Three brothers grac'd The formost line of Sparta, natives all Of sweet AmyclÃ¦, all in age and arms Mature, their splendid lineage from the stock Of Tyndarus deriving. Them on earth Three javelins, whirl'd successive, laid supine, An effort of Mardonius. Three in rank Behind partake the same resistless doom, Three bold companions in the hardy chace Of boars on green TaÃ¿getus. Supply'd With weapons new, the phalanx still to gore He perseveres unweary'd, not unlike Some irritated porcupine, of size Portentous, darting his envenom'd quills Through each assailant. In Laconia's front So many warriors and their weapons fall'n, Leave in her triple tire of pointed steel A void for swift impression of her foes. In rush Briareus and PangÃ¦us huge, Whose maces send fresh numbers to the shades. The op'ning widens. On his vaulting steed Mardonius follows, like ensanguin'd Mars By his auxiliars grim, dismay and rage, Preceded. Rivalling the lightning's beams, The hero's sabre bright and rapid wheels Alost in air. A comet thus inflames The cheek of night; pale mortals view in dread Th' unwonted lustre, transient tho' it be, Among the lights of heav'n. Pausanias rous'd, Advancing, at Briareus points his lance. Meantime six Spartans of the younger class Assail Mardonius. One his bridle grasp'd; The Persian sabre at the shoulder close Lopp'd off th' audacious arm. Another stoop'd To seize the chieftain's foot, and drag him down; Pois'd on his stirrup, he in sunder smote The Spartan's waist. Another yet approach'd, Who at a blow was cloven to the chin. Two more the gen'rous horse, uprearing, dash'd Maim'd and disabled to the ground; the last His teeth dissigur'd, and his weight oppress'd. As some tall-masted ship, on ev'ry side Assail'd by pinnaces and skiffs whose strength Is number, drives her well-directed prow Through all their feeble clusters; while her chief Elate contemplates from her lofty deck The hostile keels upturn'd, and floating dead, Where'er she steers victorious: so the steed NisÃ¦an tramples on Laconian slain, Triumphant so Mardonius from his seat Looks down. But fate amidst his triumph shews Briareus yielding to a forceful blow Of stern Pausanias, and PangÃ¦us pierc'd By Amompharetus. Their giant bulks, Thrown prostrate, crash three long-protended rows Of Spartan spears. Wide-branching thus huge oaks, By age decay'd, or twisted-from the roots By rending whirlwinds, in their pond'rous fall Lay desolate the under shrubs, and trees Of young, unstable growth. More awful still, Another object strikes the satrap's eye; With nodding plumes, and formidable stride, Lo! Aemnestus. Asia's gen'ral feels Emotions now, which trouble, not degrade His gen'rous spirit. Not, as Priam's son On sight of dire Achilles, thoughts of flight Possess Mardonius, but to wait the foe, And if to die, with honour die, if live Enjoy a life of fame. His giant guard Around him close; one levels at the casque Of Aemnestus; but the weighty mace Slides o'er the Spartan's slanting shield, and spends Its rage in dust. The stooping giant leaves His flank unguarded, and admits a stroke, Which penetrates the entrails. Down he sinks, Another tow'r of Asia's battle strewn In hideous ruin. Soon a second bleeds, A third, a fourth. The fifth in posture stands To crush the victor with a blow well-aim'd; Him Menalippus at the brawny pit Of his uplifted arm transpiercing deep Disables. Aemnestus struggles long To grapple with his victim, and invokes Leonidas aloud. The active son Of Gobryas plants throughout the Spartan shield A wood of Javelins. His NisÃ¦an horse, Careering, vaulting, with his fangs and hoofs Protects his lord. The guards, who still surviv'd, With faithful zeal their whole united strength Exert unwearied for a lib'ral chief. Some paces backward Aemnestus forc'd, Impels his heel against a loos'ning stone, Broad, craggy, scarce inferior to the weight Discharg'd by Hector on the massy bars Of Agamemnon's camp. The Spartan quick From his left arm removes the heavy shield, With javelins thick transfix'd. From earth he lifts The casual weapon, and with caution marks The fatal time and distance. O'er the heads Of thy surrounding guard the fragment hurl'd Descends, Mardonius, on thy manly chest, And lays thee o'er thy courser's back supine Without sensation. O, illustrious man, Whose dazzling virtues through thy frailties beam'd! Magnanimous, heroic, gen'rous, pure In friendship, warm in gratitude! This doom At once dissolves all interval of pain To mind, or body. Not a moment more Hast thou, ingenuous satrap, to repine, Or grieve. Go, hero, thy Masistius greet, Where no ambition agitates the breast, No gloomy veil of superstition blinds, No friend can die, no battle can be lost! This fall, to Greece decisive as to heav'n Enceladus o'erthrown, when, thunder-piere'd, He under Ãtna's torrid mass was chain'd, Discomsits Asia's hopes. In fresh array Meantime the phalanx, by Pausanias form'd, Proceeds entire. Facility of skill Directs their weapons; pace by pace they move True to the cadence of accustom'd notes From gentle flutes, which trill the Doric lays Of Alcman and Terpander. Slow they gain The ground, which Persia quits, till Chileus bold With his TegÃ¦ans gores the hostile flanks; Confusion then, and gen'ral rout prevail. The fugitives proclaim Mardonius slain; The whole Barbarian multitude disperse In blind dismay; cool Mindarus in vain Attempts to check their flight; all seek the camp; And now the Spartan flutes, combin'd with shouts Of loud TegÃ¦ans stimulate his speed Across the ford. His trenches he regains, There to Midias, Tiridates brave, And chosen satraps, gath'ring at his call, Thus spake: The flow'r of Asia in the dust Reclines his glories. Feel your loss like me, Not overcome by sorrow, or surprise At changes natural to man, the sport Of his own passions, and uncertain chance. Vicissitudes of fortune I have prov'd, One day been foil'd, a conqueror the next. In arduous actions though experienc'd minds Have much to fear, not less of hope remains To animate the brave. Amid this storm The throne of Cyrus, your exalted sires, Your own nobility, recall; deserve The rank, you hold; occasion now presents For such a trial. To uphold my king, My country's name, and piously revenge My kindred blood new-spilt, my sword, my arm, My life, I destine. Multitude is left, Surpassing twenty myriads; ev'n despair Befriends us; famine threat'ning, and the dread Of merciless resentment in our foes, May force these rally'd numbers to obtain From their own swords relief. Behold your camp, Strong-fenc'd and bulwark'd by Masistian care, A present refuge. See th' auxiliar Greeks Entire, advancing on th' inferior bands Of Athens. Still may Xerxes o'er the West Extend his empire, and regret no part Of this disaster, but Mardonius slain. Assume your posts, for stern defence provide. End of the Twenty-ninth Book. BOOK the Thirtieth. O God of light and wisdom! thee the Muse Once more addresses. Thou didst late behold The Salaminian brine with Asian blood Discolour'd. Climbing now the steep ascent To thy meridian, for a stage of war More horrible and vast, thy beaming eye Prepare. Thou over wide PlatÃ¦a's field, Chang'd to a crimson lake, shall drive thy car, Nor see a pause to havoc, till the West In his dark chamb rs shuts thy radiant face. Now had the herald, to Cecropia's chief Sent by Pausanias, in his name requir'd Immediate aid. No doubt suspends the haste Of Aristides; who arrays his ranks With cordial purpose to sustain that strength Of Greece, Laconia's phalanx. Lo! in sight New clouds of battle hov'ring. He discerns Th' array of Leontiades, with wings Of Macedonic, and Thessalian horse; Then calls Sicinus: Friend, he said, observe; Robust and bold, to perfidy inur'd, Not less than arms, yon Thebans cross our march. I trust the justice of our cause will foil Them, thrice our number; but events like this Are not in man's disposal. If I fall, Not rashly, good Sicinus, rest assur'd, Themistocles survives. The gate of Greece He guards, EubÅa and Thessalia holds, Those granaries of plenty. Eastern shores With all his force, perhaps victorious now, Xanthippus will relinquish, and maintain The sea auxiliar to thy prudent lord; Thus all be well, though Aristides bleeds: This to Themistocles report. But go, Fly to Cleander; him and all the Greeks Rouse from the fane of Juno to the field; Both Spartans and Athenians want their aid. Thy tribe, undaunted Cimon, place behind Olympiodorus; if his active bands Repel Thessalia's horse, avoid pursuit; Wheel on the flank of Thebes. Here Delphi's priest: Behold Emathia's standards front thy right; With Haliartus, and OÃ¯leus' son, Let me be station'd there. I trust, the spouse Of Amarantha, at her father's sight, Will sheath a sword involuntary drawn, Nor ties of hospitality and blood Prosane to serve Barbarians. I accept The gen'rous offer, sage and gallant seer, Spakc Aristides. In that wing thy friend, The learn'd and manly Ãschylus presides. But, to thy god appealing, I enjoin Thy rev'rend head to cover in retreat Its unpolluted hairs, should fire of youth, Or yet more strong necessity, impel Thy son to battle. Here th' enraptur'd priest: The inspiration of my god I feel; A glorious day to Athens I presage, I see her laurels fresh. Apollo joins His sister Pallas to preserve a race, Which all the Muses love. His awful power Will chain the monster parricide, and rouse The Grecian worth in Alexander's heart. These animated accents fire the line. Within the measure of an arrow's flight Each army now rank'd opposite. A thought Of piety and prudence from his place Mov'd Aristides. Single he advanc'd Between the hosts; offensive arms he left Behind him; ev'n his plumed helm resign'd Gave to his placid looks their lib'ral flow. Before him hung his ample shield alone, Timothea's gift, whose sculptur'd face display'd Truth, equity, and wisdom hand in hand, As in his breast. Exalting high in tone His gracious voice, he thus adjur'd his foes: Ye men deriv'd from Cadmus, who in Greece Establish'd letters, fruitful mother since Of arts and knowledge, to Barbarian spoil This hour expos'd; ye sons of Locris, hear, Thessalians, Phocians, Dorians, all compell'd By savage force to arm against your friends, Of language, rites and manners with your own Congenial: Aristides, in the name Of all the Grecian deities, invokes Your own sensations to disarm your hands Of impious weapons, which retard the help We bear to those now struggling in defence Of Grecian freedom, sepulchres and fanes. He said; was heard like Enoch, like the man Who walk'd with God, when eminently good Among th' obscene, the violent, and false, Of justice and religion, truth and peace He spake exploded, and from menac'd death To God withdrew. The fell BÅotians rend The sky with threat'ning clamour, and their spears Shake in defiance; while the word to charge Perfidious Leontiades conveys. Retreating backward, Aristides cloaths His face in terror. So Messiah chang'd His countenance serene, when full of wrath Bent on Satanic enemies, who shook Heav'n's peaceful champaign with rebellious arms, He grasp'd ten thousand thunders, and infix'd Plagues in their souls; while darts of piercing fire Through their immortal substances, by sin Susceptible of pain, his glaring wheels Shot forth pernicious. Aristides leads His phalanx on. Now Greeks to Greeks oppose Their steely structures of tremendous war. With equal spears and shields their torrent fronts They clash together; as the justling rocks, Symplegades Cyanean, at the mouth Of Thracia's foaming Bosphorus, were feign'd, Infrangible opponents, to sustain A mutual shock which tempested the frith, Dividing Europe from the Orient world. Meanwhile PhÅbean Timon's glowing zeal, Replete with patriot and religious warmth, Thus in the wing which Ãschylus had form'd, Bespake the encircling chieftains: O'er the space Between Asopus, and the main array Of Thebes, I see the Macedonian horse But half advanc'd: Their tardy pace denotes Reluctance. Lo! I meditate an act. To prove my zeal for universal Greece, Her violated altars, and the tombs Robb'd of their precious dust. My slender band, So long companions in adventures high With your choice Locrians, Haliartus, join To Medon's banner. Ãschylus, observe My progress; if my piety succeeds, Thou, as a soldier, take advantage full. So saying, o'er the plain in solemn pace His rev'rend form he moves, by snowy bands Pontifical around his plumed helm Distinguish'd. Thus from Salem's holy gate Melchisedek, the priest of him Most High, Went forth to meet, and benedictions pour On Terah's son in Shaveh's royal vale. The Macedonian squadrons at the sight Fall back in rev'rence; their dismounting prince So wills. The father and the son embrace. Oh! Amarantha's husband! joyful sighs The parent. Oh! my Amarantha's sire! In equal joy the husband. Timon then: A Greek in blood, to Delphi's priest ally'd, The god of Delphi's blessing now secure; Abandon these Barbarians to the fate, Which in the name of PhÅbus I denounce For his insulted temple, and the rape Of Amarantha from Minerva's shrine. Yet to unsheath an unsuspected sword Against them, neither I, nor heav'n require, Less thy own honour; but repass the stream, Amid this blind uproar unnotic'd seek ThermopylÃ¦ again; and reach thy realm. O'er all that clime Themistocles prevails, My friend; his present amity obtain, Cecropia's future love, nor hazard more Thy fame and welfare. Aristides knows My truth, replies the monarch; now to thee Obedience prompt a second proof shall yield. Ascend a steed; to Amarantha's arms I will conduct thee first; th' auspicious flight Of both, a father shall assist and bless. They speed away, in extasy the sire To clasp his darling child in Dirce's grove. This pass'd in Medon's eye, who watchful stood With Haliartus, and a troop advanc'd, In care for Timon. When apparent now The Macedonian squadrons quit the field Of strife, the heavy-cuirass'd of his wing With serry'd shields by Ãschylus is led, In evolution wheeling on the flanks Of that strong mass'd battalia, which compos'd The hostile center. First in phalanx stood Unwilling Locrians. Medon lifts his voice, And to each eye abash'd his awful shape, Like some reproving deity, presents; They hear, they see OÃ¯leus in his son, As ris'n a mourning witness of their shame From his sepulchral bed. The banners drop Before him; down their spears and bucklers fall; They break, disperse, and fly with childrens' fear, When by authority's firm look surpris'd In some attempt forbidden, or unmeet. BÅotian files are next. With sudden wheel They form a front, and dauntless wait the assault. Still in the van robust and martial Thebes Unbroken stems th' agility and skill Of her opponent Athens. Long unspent The tide of well-conducted battle flows Without decision strong. At length by fate Is Leontiades impell'd to meet Cecropia's chief, where Thebes began to feel His mighty pressure. Whether justice strung His nerves with force beyond a guilty hand, Or of his manly limbs the vigour match'd His fortitude of mind; his falchion clove Down to the neck that faithless Greek, of Greece The most malignant foe. The treacherous deed, Which laid fair Thespia, with PlatÃ¦an tow'rs In dust, he thus aton'd. A bolt from heav'n Thus rives an oak, whose top divided hangs On either side obliquely from the trunk. Murichides the Hellespontin bleeds, Too zealous friend of Asia, in whose cause This day he arm'd. By great Mardonius charg'd Late messenger of friendship, he in peace On Salaminian shores had touch'd the hand, Which now amid the tumult pierc'd his heart, Not willingly, if known. Then Lynceus fell, From Ådip?an Polynices sprung, The last remains of that ill-fated house. Mironides and Clinias near the side Of Aristides fought, his strong support. Yet undismay'd and firm three hundred chiefs, Or sons of proudest families in Thebes, Dispute the victory till death. Meantime Olympiodorus from the left had gall'd Thessalia's squadrons, like a sleety storm Checking their speed. Athenian horse, though few, Mix'd with their bowmen, well maintain'd their ground. His own true-levell'd shaft transfix'd the throat Of Larissean Thorax; who in dust Buries at length his Aleuadian pride. Rememb'ring all his charge bold Cimon rears His mighty spear. Impetuous through a band Of yielding Phocians he on Theban ranks Falls like a rapid falcon, when his weight Precipitates to strike the helpless prey. Him slaughter follows; slaughter from the right On Ãschylus attends, and mightier waits On Aristides. Justice in his breast Awhile was blind to mercy undeserv'd, Ev'n unimplor'd, by persevering foes Invet'rate. Now on this empurpled stage Of vengeance due to perfidy and crimes, Twice their own number had the Athenians heap'd Of massacred BÅotians; but as heav'n, Not to destruction punishing, restrains Its anger just, and oft the harden'd spares, That time may soften, or that suff'rings past, Not measur'd full, may turn the dread of more To reformation; Aristides thus Relenting bade retreat be sounded loud, Then, by th' obedient host surrounded, spake Serene: Enough of Grecian blood is spilt, Ye men of Athens; low in dust are laid The heads of those who plann'd the fall of Greece. The populace obtuse, resembling you, Enlighten'd people, as the sluggish beast A gen'rous courser, let your pity save In gratitude to Jove, creating yours Unlike BÅotia's breedâNow form again. Thus equity and mercy he combin'd, Like that archangel, authoris'd by heav'n Chief o'er celestial armies, when the fall'n From purity and faith in Eden's bow'rs Not to perdition nor despair he left Abandon'd. Aristides still proceeds: New victories invite you; Sparta long Hath wanted succour; Men of Athens, march. Lo! Menalippus greets in rapid haste This more than hero. I am come, he said, To bring thee tidings of Mardonius slain In open fight. Pausanias still demands Thy instant presence. In pursuit he reach'd The stream. âNot now that passage is forbid,â Tisamenus exclaim'd. The gen'ral pass'd In vain to force the well-defended camp; Repuls'd in ev'ry part he dubious stands With disappointment sore; on Attic skill To mount entrenchments and a rampart storm Laconians and TegÃ¦ans both depend To crown the day. Th' Athenian heard, and cool In four divisions separates the host. Four thousand warriors, light and heavy-arm'd, Each part compose; whose ensigns o'er the flood In order just are carry'd. He attains Th' adjacent field, and joins Pausanias there; Whose ravell'd brow, and countenance of gloom Present a lion's grimness, who, some fold, Or stall attempting, thence by vollied stones Of trooping shepherds, and of herdsmen, chas'd, Hath sullenly retreated, though oppress'd By famine dire. To Aristides spake With haughtiness redoubled Sparta's chief: Didst thou forget, Athenian, who commands The Grecian armies? Thou hast loiter'd long Since my two mandates. With majestic warmth The righteous man: Pausanias, now receive From Aristides language new, but just. Thine is the pride of satraps, not the light Ingenuous vanity of Greeks, from sense Of freedom, sense of cultivated minds, Above the rest of mortals. No; a black, Barbaric humour festers at thy heart, Portending usurpation. Know, proud man, Thou hast been weigh'd, and long deficient found By Aristides, thy superior far, Then most superior, when for public good Compliant most. Thou soon, O! Spartan born, Yet in thy country's decency untaught, Will like a Persian cast a loathing eye On freedom, on Lycurgus and his laws, Which gall a mind despotic. I presage Thee dangerous, Pausanias. Where the seeds Of dark ambition I suspect, my eye Becomes a jealous centinel; beware, Nor force my active vigilance to proof Now or in future, when united Greece, No more defensive, may retaliate war, Successful war, which prompts aspiring thoughts. Rest now a safe spectator. From defeat Of real warriors, of our fellow Greeks, Not Persians lightly arm'd in loose array, The loiterers of Athens shall with ease Surmount that fence impregnable to thee. To wait an answer he disdain'd, but march'd; While arrogance in secret gnash'd the teeth Of this dark-minded Spartan, doom'd to prove The boding words of Aristides true. The sun, no longer vertical, began His slant Hesperian progress. At the head Of his own host Cecropia's chief began. Enthusiastic flame, without whose aid The soldier, patriot, and the bard is faint, At this great crisis thus inspires the man Of human race the most correct in mind: Ye shades of all, who tyrants have expell'd, Ye, who repose at Marathon entomb'd, Ye glorious victims, who exalt the name Of Salamis, and Manes of the brave Leonidas, arise! Our banners fan With your Elysian breath! Thou god supreme, Jove elutherian, send thy child belov'd, With her Gorgonian Ã¦gis, to defend A people struggling not for spoil, or pow'r, Not to extend dominion, but maintain The right of nature, thy peculiar gift To dignify mankind. I lift this prayer, My citizens, in rev'rence, not in doubt Of your success. Ye vanquishers of Greeks, Beneath your spears yon servile herd will fall, As corn before the sickle. With a look Of circumspection he remark'd a swell Of ground not fifty paces from the camp; Olympiodorus and his bowmen there He posted first. Now, Ãschylus, he said, Construct of solid shields a brazen roof; In contact close to yonder fence of wood Form like the tortoise in his massy shell. The archers, each like PhÅbus skill'd, remove With show'rs of death the thick defendants soon Clear from the rampart, which in height surpass'd Two cubits. Ãschylus not slow performs His task. A rank of sixty warriors plac'd Erect, with cov'ring bucklers o'er their heads, A brazen platform to the wall unites. The next in order stoop behind; the last Kneel firm on earth. O'er implicated shields A stable passage thus when Cimon sees, He mounts, and fearless eyes the Asian camp. Between the rampart's basis and the foe An empty space observing, on the ground His spear he fixes, and amidst a storm Of clatt'ring javelins, arrows, darts and stones, Swings down. So, shooting from the sulph'rous lap Of some dark-vested cloud, a globe of fire Through winds and rain precipitates a blaze Terrific down the raven pall of night. His whole division follows; with his band Myronides, and Ãschylus, releas'd From his first care. Successively they range. The very fence, by Persian toil uprais'd, Now from the Persian multitude secures Th' Athenian near. No obstacle remains To Aristides, who compleats his plan. Olympiodorus and his active train With axes keen, and cleaving spades approach; Hewn down, uptorn in that surmounted part, The fall'n defences, and the levell'd ground, Soon leave an op'ning wide. His strong reserve, Eight thousand light, two thousand heavy-arm'd, With Haliartus, and OÃ¯leus' son, Cecropia's chief leads forward to sustain His first bold warriors. Chileus enters next With his TegÃ¦ans, Aemnestus brave, Pausanias, Amompharetus, the youth Of Menalippus, all the Spartan host. Seven Grecian myriads through the breach invade A ground, with swarms of tents and men oppress'd. Dire thus th' irruption of Germanic seas Through strong Batavian mounds; th' inflated brine Stupendous piles of long-resisting weight Bears down, and, baffling strength and art combin'd, Foams o'er a country in its seat profound Below the surface of th' endang'ring main; A country, where frugality and toil No spot leave waste, no meadow, but in herds Redundant; where the num'rous dwellings shew Simplicity but plenty, now immers'd With all their throng'd inhabitants beneath Th' unsparing deluge. Aristides swift, As if by gen'ral choice the chief supreme, Commandment issues, that to either side The host extend, that, skirted by the fence, With wheeling flanks in front the line assume A crescent's figure. Thus the fisher skill'd With his capacious seines, slow-dragg'd and press'd Close on each bank, a river's whole expanse With all his natives glossy-finn'd involves. Yet Mindarus, with Mede and Persian ranks, A large remainder from the morning fight, Resists, which soon are slaughter'd; he retreats Among the tents, whose multitude impedes The Grecians. Aristides straight commands, That from the heavy line's disjointed length A hundred bands expatiate in the chace Of foes benumb'd by fear, who neither fight, Nor fly, of means depriv'd. The carnage grows In every quarter. Fountains seem unclos'd, Whence rivulets of blood o'erflow the ground. O'er satraps, potentates, and princes fall'n, Strode Aristides first of men, of heav'n The imitator in his civil deeds, Now some faint semblance, far as mortal may Of that Almighty victor on the field Ethereal, when o'er helms, and helmed heads Of prostrate seraphim, and powers o'erthrown, He rode. Still Mindarus, by courage wing'd, From nation flies to nation, still persists Exhorting; though in hopeless thought he sees Great Hyperanthes from the shades ascend, And seems to hear the godlike phantom sigh In mournful words like these: Ah! fruitless toil! As once was mine, to rescue from despair The panic fears of Asia! Dead in mind, Her host already soon dead clay must lie, Like me on Oeta's rock. Yet Midias brave, With Tiridates rous'd, their efforts join. Against them warlike Medon, and the seed Of Lygdamis, chance brings. They side by side, As heretofore ThermopylÃ¦ beheld Young Dithyrambus and Diomedon, Had all the day their unresisted wedge Of Locrian shields and Delphian led to deeds, Accumulating trophies. Midias falls By Haliartus. From the slain his lance Recov'ring, tow'rds his patron dear he turns; Him conqu'ror too of Tiridates views In joy; joy soon to sorrow chang'd! Fate guides A casual weapon from a distant hand; Such as at Ramoth from the Syrian bow, Drawn at a venture, smote between the joints Of harness strong the Israelitish king, Who from the fight bade wheel his chariot, stain'd With his own crimson. Ponderous and broad The hostile lance inflicts a mortal wound In Medon's gen'rous bosom. Not a sigh He breathes, in look still placid and sedate, While death's cold moisture stagnates on his limbs, By all their pow'rs forsaken. Bear, he said To Haliartus, bear me from the camp, Nor yet extract the weapon; life, I feel, Would follow swift, and Medon hath a charge Yet to deliver. Some pathetic Muse, In tend'rest measures give these numbers flow! Let thine, who plaintive on the pontic verge In servitude Sarmatian, through her page Of sorrows weeps thy banishment from Rome; Or thine, Euripides, whose moral strains Melt sympathy in tears at human woes, Thy vary'd tragic themes, or both unite Your inspiration to describe a heart, Where gratitude o'er all affections dear Predominantly sway'd; the faithful heart Of Haliartus at this sudden stroke Of direful chance. To death is Medon snatch'd, From glory snatch'd amid victorious friends. The Carian's bosom instant feels combin'd Achilles' anguish at Patroclus dead, The pang of Priam at the fall of Troy, Ev'n woman's grief, Andromache's distress For her slain Hector, and his mother's pain To see his mangled and dishonour'd corse. Great Artemisia's name, th' illustrious blood From Lygdamis deriv'd, his own exploits Of recent fame, are all eras'd from thought In Haliartus now; who sinks again To MelibÅus. On the wounded chief, As on his lord, his patron, still he looks With all th' affection of a menial, bred In the same home, and cherish'd in that home With lib'ral kindness to his humbler state. He clasps the fainting hero, on the shields Of weeping friends deposits, and conveys Swift through a portal, from its hinges forc'd. Three hours remain'd to PhÅbus in his course. Close by the entrenchment, under beachen shade Of ancient growth, a fountain bursts in rills Transparent; thither on the down of moss Was Medon borne and laid. Unloose, he said, My helm, and fill from that refreshing stream. Obey'd, he drank a part; then pouring down The remnant, spake: By this libation clear Be testified my thanks to all the gods, That I have liv'd to see my country sav'd On this victorious day. My fate requires No lamentation, Haliartus dear, Oh! more, than kindred, dear. Commend me first To Aristides; Medon's parting breath Him victor hails. To Delphi's virtuous priest, To my Leonteus, to the glorious son Of Neocles, my salutation bear, To kind Cleander, my TrÅzenian host, To Hyacinthus of EubÅa's race, The flower of all her chieftains: They have prov'd In me some zeal their island to redeem. Transport my ashes to Melissa's care, Them near the reliques of Laconia's king Repose; be mine the neighbour of his urn. Here with an utmost effort of his voice, With arms extended, and Elysian look: Leonidas, the life thy friendship sav'd, An off'ring to thy manes, now I close Mature in age, to glory not unknown, Above the wish, as destitute of hope To find a fairer time, or better cause, Than sends me now a messenger to greet Thee with glad tidings of this land preserv'd. With his own hand the javelin from his breast He draws serene; life issues through the wound. New shouts, new trumpets, waken from a trance Of grief the son of Lygdamis. He sees Cleander; who th' Asopian banks had pass'd, Call'd by Sicinus from Saturnia's dome. Lo! Epidaurian Clitophon, the ranks Of Phlius with Menander, Sicyon's chief Automedon, the Hermionean spears With Lycus follow, Cephallene's sons, The Acarnanian, all th' Epirot bands, Lepr?an Conon, with MycenÃ¦'s youth Polydamas, by Arimnestus led The brave PlatÃ¦ans, with his Thespian files Alcimedon, Nearcus with his force Of Chalcis, PotidÃ¦an Tydeus next, Eretrian Cleon, Lampon, and the troop Of little Styra, Corinth's banners last, By Adimantus and AlcmÃ¦on rang'd. Too late you come for glory, them bespake The Carian sad: Lo! half the foes destroy'd By Aristides, fugitives the rest; Lo! there the only loss, which Greece sustains. To him Cleander, with devout regret O'er Medon, honour'd paranymph and guest, His head inclining: Not too late we come For sacrifice of Persians to the ghost Of this dead hero. Ah! what floods of tears Will fall in TrÅzenâBut let grief prevail Hereafter. Son of Lygdamis, renounce Despondency; AcanthÃ¨ still survives To fire thy breast as Ariphilia mine; I hear her prompting my vindictive arm. From thy experience of this glorious day Lead thy TrÅzenian host, where best to point His strenuous efforts. Let thy guiding zeal For me, long cursing my inactive post, Yet find one track to fame. These gallant words Of cordial frankness from dejection lift The Carian brave, not less than PhÅbus cheer'd The languid son of Priam on the bank Of Xanthus; when a stony mass, of weight To stay a keel on Hellespontine sands, By Ajax hurl'd, benumb'd the Trojan's frame. Thus Haliartus: Through that open gate, New forc'd, the shortest, safest passage lies; But, to acquire some lustre, I can shew Another track for prowess yet to shine. He leads, all follow, save Corinthian bands With Adimantus, hast'ning through the gate, Soon as to him th' intelligence is brought; Who ent'ring, sees a carnage which confounds A timid spirit. By AlcmÃ¦on urg'd, Close by the fence he marches; none he meets But fly before him. Adimantus lifts His spear, and satiates cowardice with blood Of unresisting men. By cheap success Betray'd, a distant quarter he attains, Where Mindarus confronts him. From his steed Th' unyielding satrap whirls a rapid lance, Which nails the base Corinthian to the ground. AlcmÃ¦on next is wounded; more had bled, But Aristides o'er that part, devoid Of tents, his dreadful crescent in array Is forming new. The Persian starts; he flies To one last angle of the spacious camp, Sole spot unforc'd. Half circled now in front, The Attic, Spartan, and TegÃ¦an ranks, In motion slow, yet moving on, augment Progressively their terrors, like a range Of clouds, which thicken on the brow of night, A final wreck portending to a fleet, Already shatter'd by the morning storm. Round Mindarus the remnant of his host Collected still is numerous. Them he sees Oft look behind, a sight that ill accords With warriors; but, as now in columns deep Its glitt'ring horns that direful crescent shews Within the limits of a javelin's cast, All turn intent on flight at large; they break Their own inclosure down, whose late defence Is present bane, and intercepts escape. Lo! Haliartus; all whose grief is chang'd To fire, heroic flame. Three myriads fresh He pours; that crouded angle he invests, Preventing flight. Cleander looks around Like some tornado menacing a bark, Which soon unseam'd and parted sinks ingulph'd; He finds a breach and with him enters death. The long-enduring satrap, whose mild soul Calamity hath worn, resembles now The poor desponding sailor, who is left Last of the found'ring vessel on a plank Alone. No coast appears; the greedy swell He sees around, expecting ev'ry wave Will terminate his being, and forgoes All hope of succour. His afflicted soul Thus with an effort equal to his rank The prince explores: What, Mindarus, remains For thee deserted! In another's home Cleora dwells; Masistius is no more; Slain is Mardonius, Asia's glory fall'n; Thou hast too long been fugitive this day; Like Teribazus close a term of woe; Like him in death be honour'd. He dismount, He grasps a spear. Such dignity of shame To Ilian Hector, from his flight recall'd, Great Homer's Muse imparted. While the prince Is meditating thus, a man sublime Tow'rs from th' Athenians, who suspend their march; Unlike the son of Peleus in his ire Implacable, he represents a god In aspect, god of mercy, not of arms. Know, chieftain, he began, to me the Greeks One Persian life have granted; it is thine. In this day's trial I have noted well Thy constancy and manhood; I, who prize The gems of virtue, in whatever clime, O Persian! whether in a friend or foe Their never-changing lustre they display; I, Aristides, my protecting arm Extend. Time presses; yield thee, ere too late; Captivity no burden shalt thou find, Till safe, without a ransom, thou regain Thy native seat. The Persian melts like snow In all its rigour at the noon-ride sun. This unforeseen, humane demeanour calms His mind, and hushes ev'ry desp'rate thought. He thus replies: On all my actions past Hath fortune frown'd; perhaps a captive state With Aristides, whom Masistius lov'd, Mardonius prais'd, and all mankind reveres, Forebodes a change of fortune to my gain! Thy condescending wisdom, O supreme In justice, knowledge, and benignant deeds, May lift a man of sorrows from despair! He yields. Th' Athenian leads him through the press Secure; himself a spectacle avoids, Which others covet. Lo! on ev'ry side Keen swords of massacre are wav'd. To maids Deflow'r'd, dishonour'd wives, and gods prophan'd, To Athens, Thespia, and PlatÃ¦a burnt, The Greeks compleat their sacrifice. The sun, Wont on those fields of glist'ning green to smile, And trace Asopus through his crystal maze, Now setting, glances over lakes of blood; While fate with Persian carnage chafes the stream No longer smooth and limpid, but o'erswoln, And foaming purple, with encreasing heaps Of carcases and arms. Night drops her shade On thirty myriads slaughter'd. Thus thy death, Leonidas of Sparta, was aveng'd, Greece thus by Attic virtue was preserv'd. FINIS.</field>
