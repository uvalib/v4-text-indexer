      <field name="fulltext">????????????. OR A Discourse of Militarie Discipline. Shewing the necessitie therof according to these perillous TIMES. Paucos viros fortes Natura procreat; Multos bona institutione facit industria. VEGET. li. 3. To the Most worthy and experienced Captaine, the Lieutenant and all the well Disciplined companie, Trained up in the Militarie yard at Norwich. Dedicatory and introductory epistles in prose are numbered [1] and [2]. [3] To his friend the Author. Because th' are few that doe things worthy praise, Free truth is counted flatterie now a daies: And though it be our common Poets shame, Truth cries thy Muse not guiltie of that blame. Thou Orpheus-like our Heroes dost incite To warlike gests, and Mirmidons to fight. Such successe wish I, that this Booke may be As free from Envie, as from flatterie. The most indulgent thought my Pen drops forth I dare not thinke can adde unto the worth Of this rare piece; which shall (where it doth come) Strike Envie blind, and base detractors dumbe. And so I wish all cankerd spight may die, Dispis'd, condem'd by noble industrie. And though th' ast those which this taske better fit From me much love expect, from them much wit. RO. WOTTON [4] To any to whom I write. Blame not my Muse, thou that dost find thy name Not Marshal'd here, as thou wouldst have the same: No blemish tis to thy repute: for (know it) I act no Herald here (Sir) but a Poet. [5] To the same. (Kind Gentlemen) Souldiers, or Clarkes, or both My Muse as gentle greetes you well (in troth) And tels you shee can't wooe yee at your tables By venting fripperies of Jests, or fables Not worth the Phrygian Princes eares; nor raise A bare name to her selfe, by vulgar praise. No, no: she joyes in action: and know that By the protection of a Bever Hat, Or silken out-side, shee disdaines to force Your presence; but had rather take a course To shew her selfe to you in reall pow'rs Then bid her welcome, and she's ever yours. R. K. [6] To Captaine HENRY SHELTON. If many yeeres in honours service spent; If vertues suting with a brave descent, Can give true lustre to a Name; then thine May seeme least to require a Verse of mine. To give thy worth just height: yet Time displayes Many fine heads, that oft have earnd the bayes In these and meaner taskes: for fame must know She cannot pay those glories, shee doth owe To great and good deserts, except some aides Be sent her from the nine Castalian maides. Had Homer (whom seven Cities strove to owne) Not beene; then who had great Achilles knowne, Or Hector in these times. Then let none blame My Muse, although shee beares a part with fame In thy due prayse; whether shee doth commend Thy truest valour, that did alway tend To noblest ends, or praise those honest Arts With which thou didst attract the Souldiers Darts. Nor art thou lesse expert to live belov'd In Peace, then Warre: to love thee all are mov'd By thy humanitie, and pietie. Then let detraction foule and calumnie Be alway Dumbe: and let the World know ever, Thou maist be envy'd much, but flattered never. [7] To M?. THOMAS KNEVET of Ashwell Thorpe. Thou, that dost know thy Starres, canst calculate Thy geniture, and see to what end fate Did lend thee to the earth; auspicious be Thy favours, like thy Starres to mine and me: Thou knowst thy Starres (I say) for good men know Wherefore th' are borne, and what to God they owe, And how farre th' are engag'd to Prince, or state: For Grace, and Wisedome be the Starres and fate That governe them: these like those twinne fires bright Doe prosper all those that Sayle by their light: These Steere men safely to the Haven of blisse, In spite of strongest contrarieties. These be thy Starres, that set th' above thy blood, True patterne and true patrone of whats good: Thou art the Glasse in which the World may see, What once our Gentrie was, and still should bee. A lover of thy Countrie, and of arts Art thou; disdaining to make thy good parts Ambitions Ladder, but had rather stay, Till time shall see thy merit rise like day And strike a Rosie blush in Honours face; 'Cause shee had mist so long so fit a place For her best favours, which they shall admit To great Imployments, answering thy wit, And heroique vertue; such great happinesse I wish to thee, that dost deserve no lesse. [8] To Sir ROGER TOWNSEND. I Sent my Muse unto the house of fame, Of her to enquire out some Honourd name Worthy of my Verse, and shee commends to mee A Townsend; then I quickly thought of thee; Then whom, a wiser head, Sol doth not see; Thy actions with such judgement seasond bee. Thou from thy fortunes height dainst to looke on Lowly Parnassus, and poore Helicon; On humble Helicon, whose withered bayes, Witnesse the Frostie dulnesse of these dayes. When merits starve, because they scorne to bee Base fortunes slaves, and fooles are raisd (we see) And Knaves, for now great men make greatest use Of these to hide, or perpetrate abuse. We Arts unhappie servants must be glad To fall before an Asse, in Scarlet clad, And or like Egypts foolish Priests adore Monsters, in shapes of men, o'r still be poore. We sorted are with the Plebeian rout, And live as men borne onely to weare out Serges, eat offalls, or to fetch our drinke From the Spring head, or consume Lampes and inke; When silly Silke-wormes strout in sundry shapes Like Proteus, when Sycophants and Apes Baboones, Buffones and sprucer trencher Squires, Be neatly drest in Honors richest tires. But you Sir Roger (on whose honord name, More noble Vertues are scor'd up by fame, Then Time hath lent you yeares) an Artist are And Artist[s] love; then double be your share In truest happinesse, and let your night Day, morne, and even, on you shine ever bright, And from your geniall bed let fruites appeare, Worthy your worthy selfe, and your Bel-vere. [9] To Sir CHARLES LE-GROSSE. The King of Pyrrhus shewd the Muses nine And Phoebus portraited by sculpture fine: But thou faire Knight-hoods fairer ornament Conspicuously dost to our eyes present Phoebus, the Muses nine, the Graces three, Mercurie, and Mars, yea more Gods then bee In Homers Iliads; or at least much greater: For thy mind's a Pantheon, or a Theater, Wherein all vertues, and all graces stand, In decent order link'd, with hand in hand. The[e] 'mongst the chiefest of the Arts few friends I list: and so adore thy noble ends, That if my Quill to vertue can life give, Thy honourd fame shall Nestors age outlive. [10] To Sir JOHN HARE. Want in a plentie is too rife with us; So in the streame chin-deepe stands Tantalus Wooing the coye Apples: and tis oft found That wit is scarce, where riches doe abound. For golden Asses are no dainties here, They may be dayly seene, even everie where. But you (Sir John) whose youth with store is crown'd, Are nothing lesse to Art, and Nature bound Then Fortune, yea such is your worth that now, A Knight-hood becomes few so well as you. [11] To Sir WILLIAM YELVERTON of Ruffham. Tis meete [a] Virgils Quill should write of thee, Where such a concurrence of G[r]aces bee; That were all Gentrie out of frame, we might By thee take patterne, how to set it right. Thy worth a brisker Muse then mine requires; Then let them sing while mine alone admires. [12] To Sir MILES HOBART Knight of the Bathe. Never dranke I of Pegasus his well, Nor in Parnassus dream't (that I can tell) Though I write Verse, for I would have men know it, The Times are good or ill, make me a Poet. To praise Ulisses wise, as much my care is, As to condemne Thersites, or vaine Paris. And as sweete Orpheus to his Harpe did set High tun'd Ditties, great courages to whet; So ever bee't my taske, to move great spirits, And honourable soules, to brave demerits. Mongst whom (Sir Miles) me thinkes I see you rise Like Phosphorus, grac'd with such qualities, That they, as well as your high orders rites, May justly ranke you with the best of Knights. [13] To Sir JOHN HENNINGHAM. To praise your lon[g]liv'd, or long honord name, A wrong were to your vertues (Henningham) Let those which can affoord nought else that's good, Extoll the borrow'd honors of their blood. Your Gentrie you may justly call your owne, Although you bought it not, nor from furd-gowne, It tooke; nor in Tobacco papers wrapt; It brought from Spaine; nor with a white Coyfe capt It chatting found in that great guiltie hall, Where Cerberus for Golden soppes doth baule. But from your honord vertues the same flowes, And this true Gentrie is: the rest are showes. [14] To Sir HEYMAN LE-STRANGE. As doth the purple headed rose prickt in The tender bosome, of the Paphian Queene, All beauties of the Garden farre out shine: So doe those worthy parts, and Arts of thine, Set thee above most (divine Le-Strange) That know'st as well to walke the Muses range, As thine owne groves: and canst without a thred, Find what in learnings Laberynth is hid. The age discovers few such men alive, That rich, can also teach their minds to thrive. [15] To Sir THOMAS SOUTHWELL. Tablets of Gold, with richest Rubies set Shine not so bright, as doth the Cabinet Wherein your soule is lock't; a Palace fit For such a noble courage, and a wit. Ever maist thou give Adders audience Unto tame flatterie: nor let sence With sugred baytes delude thy intellect: But ever let some noble end direct Thy good disignes: yea let them alwayes bee Both correspondent to thy stemme, and thee. [16] To Sir THOMAS WOODHOUSE. You are the man, that well descerne what betters An high fortune, and can preferre good letters Before those painted plumes, which Crowne the crest Of swelling honor: such great interest In your most worthy parts possesseth art, That your high wisedome seemes to have got the start Of your great fortunes, though they well befit Both your thrice worthy Pedigree, and wit. [17] To Sir THOMAS RICHARDSON. Hee, and no judge, that never had the skill With words, one better then himselfe to kill: Nor ere did lay a plot for to oppresse The new made widdow, and the fatherlesse: Nor ever did Church-lands or Commons wring From God; both dead and living injuring: Certes is cleere from many crying crimes; Yet such, as be, made customes by the times. But you Sir Thomas 'midst your fortunes must Regard, that you, and what is yours are dust That in this world, you have but a short lease, And may be turn'd out when your Land-lord please. Know eke that what is yours, is yours to give And live so well, that you may die to live. [18] To Sir ROBERT GAUDY. First, if I might safely crave this worlds pelfe; To be belov'd next would I wish my selfe, And rather then the first alone I'de chuse, The second I would take and that refuse. But you Sir Robert have fates blessing got, Y'are wealthy, and belov'd, yea and what not Nor ever were the Starres more just (I swear't) With such great goods, to trust such good desert. [19] To Sir DRU DRURY. As did love wounded Echo dote upon The beautiful Narcissus, that lov'd none; So doth my Muse affect your worthy parts Applauded every where, by tongues and hearts. And though I in your praise come short of many Yet may my love to you ranke me with any. [20] To Sir JOHN HOBART. Since [th'] are no thriving arts: but whats well gain'd May with much comfort, and long be retain'd, But Justice oft cryes the oppressour quit, By sending his yong Heyre too scant a wit For his large meanes; that soone all goes to pot: For fooles doe ill keepe, what knaves have ill got. But you (Sir John) are free'd from such blacke brands, Both by the cleannesse of your fathers hands. And your owne ripenesse, who can use your fortune, Both spend, and spare, as time and cause importune: Sole master of your selfe, and pelfe, you are, Which is a freedome among great men rare. [21] To Sir ROBERT BELL. To ring out thy great frame, if I had skill, The E'cho thereof should our Iland fill. So consonant's thy vertue to thy wit, And so thy outward feature graceth it, That my Muse may one sillable adde well Unto thy Surname, and call thee Le-bell. [22] To Sir WILLIAM DE-GRAY. I Take thy name on Fames bare word (Sir Knight) I know thee not; yet sweare I think th' art right Because thou art belov'd; then ever bee My Muse obsequious to thy worth, and thee. He that good store of sincere love hath wonne, Wisely hath playd his game, and fairely runne. [23] To M?. FRAMMINGHAM GAUDY. Gaudy such store of worth doth Crowne thy name, That it like to [a] columne stands which fame To lasting memorie, and honour builds, Whereon thy vertues hang like Pensile shields, As Trophyes of those glorious Victories, Wonne from the lesser Worlds great enemies Then let thy fame with time vie dayes and yeares, Let death be joy to thee; to others teares. [24] To M?. SHEPHERD of Kyrby. (Old Melibee) that hast the hearts of all, Because thy love is likewise generall: Not Time alone, but thy deare Countries cares Which far exceed thy yeares, have chang'd thy haires To white: then let thy Silver age thee fold In more contents, then did thy age of gold. [25] To M?. WEBBE of Breckles. That curious Webbe which proud Arachne spunne, Or that which chast Penelope begunne, Match not this piece whose worth exceedes all choice, That Pallas to owne it may well rejoyce Arachnes silken webbe descipherd plaine Joves scapes, and what might thee Olympists staine But (worthy Webbe) all beaut'ous graces bee Both morrall, and Divine be discribed in thee. [26] To M?. ANTHONY HOBART of Hales. When the Thessalian witches uttered Their charmes to Luna, she wont to looke red: So doe true vertues blush to heare their praise, While the praisd Peacocke his gay plumes displayes. But you may safely heare while safely I Commend your wisedome, or your honestie: For he that attributes to merits true Deserved praise, payes vertue but her due. [27] To M?. PHILIP WOODHOUSE. Methought I stood that sacred fountaine night Where high conceites in blessed draughts are lent Whose cristall brest seem'd sudainly to rent And when a Nimph of rarest majestie. Whose hayre seem'd Gold, and skinne cleare Ivorie, Upon her browes an Arch of bayes was bent, Her presence taught even Trees to complement. For all the Laurells bow'd, and modestie, With a low voice, seem'd, to give suffrage free, To make her Empresse of faire Helicon. With that I heard a grone, which seem'd to be Sent from the urnes, of Poets dead and gone, Whose Ghostes envy'd this peerelesse Ladies grace. That should them all in loftie straines surpasse, Mistake me not (I thinke) your Muse was shee, That like this Sylvane Nymphe appear'd to me. [28] To M?. WILLIM POSTON of Paston. (Yong hopefull sprigge) that art borne to inherit Abundant wealth (if thou dost not preferre it Before the freedome) know that thy best use Of thine; is to be liberall; not profuse. Know likewise that content is your best store; And that to covet more, is to be poore. For Covetise as well wants whats her owne, As what is not: seeke rather to be knowne By the great vertues, then thy great estate; Nor let thy tempting heapes of drosse elate Thy mind above thy selfe; but still remember In May, and June, what followes in December. Marke how thy youth, thy pleasures, and thy wealth, Yea life and all doe flits away be stealth. Know that this world is but a Tombe of clay, To keepe thy body till the latter day: Thinke ever that th' art neare thy day of doome, And be prepard to waite on the Bridegroome. Thus maist thou be a thrice most happie one In life, in death, and resurrection. [29] To M?. PETTIE of Morley. Some of thy wealth talke, but I praise thy wit, And many worthy vertues gracing it. But thy great love to Arts, so make[s] me thine, That my true heart shall ever be the shrine Of thy good name, which in the Booke of fame I'le register to dull oblivions shame. And if my penne can adde ought to thy worth, In spite of Envies throate, it shall come forth: Till then; accept this my great loves small treasure; And Hercules his height by his foote measure. [30] To M?. JOHN HOLLAND. Thou that art made of better temperd clay, Then Titan ere made any; who dost pay Thy youth to time, with greater interest Of vertue, then of yeares, and promisest. More goods, then are of faire Pandora fain'd; And hopes more beaut'ous then her boxe contain'd. Bee thou like Phoebus, or his bayes, and find The blind God, and blind Goddesse ever kind. Be such that I to take may ever long, So faire a Theme as Holland for my Song. [31] To M?. BARTHOLOMEW COTTON. And here too growes a Tree, that may in time Beare golden Apples, in a colder clime Then is Hesperia in; for so presage Thy blossoms (Cotton) and thy spring of age. Then let kind fortune give thy worth full sayles, Till Honour greete thee with as many hayles, As ere Sejanus had: and let thy name Become th' example of well gotten fame. [32] To M?. THOMAS WARDE of Bixley. If my devout Muse could ever bring Ought worth acceptance, or an offering Unto thy Vertue, justly I might deeme My selfe thrice happie in so good a theme. Yet let thy worth vouchsafe to take these lines, As the pledges of my great Love, and signes Of true affection, wanting alone Art to discover that impression, Which the conceit of thy most high desert Hath Charracterd so deepely in my heart. And though my penne a pencill be scarce fit To Paint out to the life thy merrit; yet My heart shall ever be engag'd to thee; Because I thinke thou lov'st the Arts and mee. [33] To M?. THOMAS LAYER of Booton. Should I forget your name, you well might thinke 'Twas neither lacke of paper, nor of inke, Nor time, but want of good discretion, That caus'd the fault: nor i'st your place alone; Not the command of your Horse troupe (I meane) But that more great command, wherewith you reyne Hot mettald passions, which doth invite My Muse these few lines for your sake to write. Your want of vice, and your attractive parts, That force no feares, but bring you loves and hearts Make me a debtor to your worth: then know you I pay you this, as part of what I owe you. [34] To M?. JAMES CALTHORP. What May hath vow'd, if August truely payes What tongue or pen (Calthorp) can reach thy prayse Then let no harmeful blasts those blossomes kill, Let no affection ere mis-lead thy will. Be wise, and good, let death long stand aloofe: And let thy mind be chance, and danger proofe. [35] To M?. WILLIAM BLADWELL. Joy be to thee, of thy new place (say I) That seem'st to affect noble cavalrie, A glorie which Fraunce vaunts of, to our shame, We are become so carelesse of our fame. Some tripping Hackney, we had rather backe Or-dastard race-horse, or some snafled Jacke, Then mount the praunsing Courser, by whose pride The Riders courage might be multipli'de. And yee our Knights have yee forgot your name, Or doe yee wilfully neglect your fame; Yee by your Spurres seeme to be Chevaliers, But by your Steedes y'are Northerne Borderers, Or some Heath-scourers, fitter farre to flie Then mannage combate 'gainst an enemie. O sleepe not still; least yee contend too late, Your honours from the dust to vindicate. [36] To M?. RAPH BLEVER-HASSIT. Not onely thy affection did I prise Showne to our Militarie exercise, When here I wrote thy name (deserving Hassit) No, no: thy honestie, and vertue was it, That wonne me to this taske; then here I give What next high heaven, may make the[e] longest live. I hope youl' kindly take't; for I dare say, Such presents are not brought you every day. [37] To M?. CLEMENT HYRNE. Honest, and honord Hyrne; that dost enshrine Such worth, as should Fortune her selfe resigne. And hers, to thee; none truely might thee call Her meere favorite; or her, prodigall; Ever be shee (I wish) thy vertues slave, And readyer farre to give, then thou to crave. [38] To M?. EDMUND KNEVET. Except thy worthy brother, scarce I find A Gentleman, more truely mine, in mind Then thee; nor let opinion so ill see, To thinke thy out-side makes me honour thee; I meane thy ranke, or state; no let men know; Nor my thoughts, nor thy merits flie so low: For thou hast my affection nobly bought At Vertues highest rate, and not for nought. [39] To M?. AUSTINE HOLLE. If I could hate thee; or of my selfe so much; To entertaine foule Envy; thy wits such, I like th' Illyrian Beldames on't should gaze, Or like Mayes frosts upon the budding maze. But certes, neither I to envie know, Nor be thy rare endowments fix'd so low, That Envie can ecclipse them: then here see What love and admiration offers thee. [40] To M?. EDWARD WOOTTON. I find thee such: so kind, so true to mee, That I must owe both love, and life to thee Nor was't thy love alone, but thy desert, That made me in this place thy name insert, For this I say; and speake but what I know; Thy mind and body doe such rare gifts show, As scarce are found else-where (which used well) The times will hardly yeeld thy paralell. [41] To M?. EDWARD DOILY. To season fresh acquaintance, these lines take From him, that for his friends, and vertues sake Dares rather doe, then speake: for talke he deemes Is womanish; but action men beseemes. If ought abides then in me, or my Muse, Worth your command; tis ready for your use. [42] To M?. JOHN CRUSO. Thou that art farre more worthy of the bayes, Daigne to assist my home-spunne untun'd layes With gracious censure, for upon thy tong, Depends the grace, and fortune of my song. So sharpe a wit, and judgement dwell in thee, Refin'd by such rare knowledge, that I see Apollo's trees may grow else-where, then on Our greene Parnassus, or our Helicon. A DISCOURSE OF MILITARIE DISCIPLINE. Loe my Thalia, that was whilome seene Frisking among the Nimphs, in Forrest greene, To Satyres pipes; and that did sing (long since) Her morals smooth, to Pan the Shepheards Prince: Is now prest to a farre unfitter taske; And like Bellona, arm'd with steely caske; Powres warlike accents forth, and numbers meete For trumpets sterne, and stately buskin'd feete. Then of yee thrice three sisters that sit on Parnassus greene, and flowrie Helicon; Spinning your gentle flaxe in the coole shade; Because the Arts are growne too poore a trade, To find yee smockes withall: and that great Goddesse (Pallas) who (wheresoever thy abode is) Canst scarce discharge th' expences of thy lights, With writing Poems in long Winter nights: Be yee propicious to your gentle swaine; One draught of pure Castalian juyce him daigne; And with an active furie touch his braine, That he may set his notes in loftie straine He that extols the thing, which all men praise, Shall hardly merit those immortall bayes, That glorious wreath, that Crowne which is meete for Arbor Vittoriosa triumphole. Honor d'Imperadori &amp; di Poeti, Petrarch. (Onely) a Poet, and an Emperor. What need we praise Apollos radiant light: When dullest Hindes, can apprehend by sight More lustre in his face; then we can Paint, With best conceites; or numbers nere so quaint. But so pernicious, are the minds of men: So sinister their wils: so fraught with teene; That things, which alway doe deserve applause; Are oft contemnd by some: and heare the cause. In this worst age; each man extols that thing, Which doth to him much gaine, and profit bring: He onely is a friend unto himselfe: Devoted onely, to his idle pelfe Religion and the soveraigntie of Kings, He deemes to be, but ceremonious things. That love which he unto his neighbour owes; He payes in complements, and fained showes, And as for that respect, which doth pertaine Unto his Parents he accounts it vaine: And while he thrives, and hath enough to give: On parish almes will see his mother live. Friendship he deemes a foolish fond conceit; If it brings in no profitable freight, (Dull Camell) when he see'th the Azure heaven Full fix'd with Starres, and the bright Planets seven, The Elements; all beasts, all foules, and fish, Trees, plants, and herbes, with all that heart can wish, Created for his use; yet thinke[s] that hee Is borne, from all exteriour duties free. The com[m]on-wealths deepe wounds, pierce not his skin: He careth not who loose, so he may win. Not any sad thought would he entertaine, When Fame talk'd of so many worthies slaine, By adverse Mars, and Fortune (that coye wench) Maligning English valour, and turn'd French; That now with swelling vaunts, they dare report Their glorie equal'd our[s] at Agincort. Nor will he bestow one auspicious thought Upon the Danes designes; nor cares he ought Who winnes the day, who conquers, or who fals; Be they our friends, or proud Imperials. Thus; (by the deprav'd nature of Mans will) That worth in others is maligned still; Which in themselves they want; and onely deeme That good, which doth in private profit them. Thus things that merit all respect, and grace, Are under valu'd, and accounted base. All morall, and all martiall discipline, They slight as vaine: yea, be the same devine, They'le censure it: foule shamelesse brats That would seeme Eagles, though as blind as bats. But we (that are sent by Apollo bright, To vindicate all vertue, from the spight Of foule detraction, whose envenom'd darts, With equall rancour wound, both Armes, and Arts) (Alcides-like) whose monsters will expell; Whose slandrous tongues (as with exorcists spell) Shall by our pow'rfull numbers be conjur'd; In circles of their mouthes to rest immur'd. But intermit (my Muse) thy hastie chace; And give those Harpies leave, to breath a space: Another worke doth thy assistance aske: Then (my Virago) take thee to thy taske: And with a pirrhique straine grace every line; So shouldst thou sing of Martiall Discipline Although we (men) be led by reasons lampe; Yet ought we goe astray; because the dampe Of grosse affections doth put out that light, And from the right way makes us wander quite: That we, of silly Beasts may learne to tread The pathes, which to true happinesse doe lead. The painefull Bee doth teach us industrie. The Turtle to observe pure chastitie. The Pismire warnes us to be provident. The Nightingale shewes how we should repent. The Robin-redbrest learnes us charitie. The Storke how to requite a curtesie. The Cocke shews valour who had rather die, Then yeeld to his insulting enemie. By these; we (men) instructed are likewise In Warlike feates, and Martiall policies. The Grues cum loca calidiora petentes mare transmitiunt trianguli formam efficiunt. Cic de Nat. Cranes (by day) keepe order in their flight; And alway one stands Sentinell at night. When that the Indian Ichneumon est animall magnitudine felis: luto conuolutus cum aspide pugnant. Plin. Rat doth undertake, Against the Aspe, his partie good to make; His body he all over daubes with durt; That his foes venome can doe him no hurt. The Elephantis frigidissimus est sanguis, obid aestu torrexte a Draconibq; exputantur, &amp;c. Plin. Dragon farre to weake, to maintaine fight Against the Elephant; kills him by sleight: For in some Thicket, he in ambush lies: And (ere he be aware) doth him surprise. The In venire mollis tenuisq; cutis Crocodilo: Ideo se vt territi mergunt Delphini sub euntesq aluum ibam secunt spinu. Plin. Dolphin, not of force, with his sharpe finne To pierce the Crocodiles hard scaly skinne, Seemes to retreate, as wearie of the fight; And diving downe, doth counterfeit a flight: Then from the deepes, remounting sudainely, His foes soft belly wounds, and makes him dy. The Horse, the Bull, and Bore know when and how Both to assaile their foes, and shift a blow. If these brute creatures (led alone by sence) Can so expertly make their owne defence, To save that bloud, which we account so base That oft we spill it, to enjoy the case; Then we should be ten thousand times more wise, To save that life, which we so highly prise. Nor is the losse of life the greatest ill, Redounding from the want of warlike skill: For honours, freedome, goods, oft goe to wracke In each ill mannag'd state, where that doth lacke. Great Alexander, in his growing pride, Granicus Bithyniae fluvius pugna quae inter Persas &amp; Alexandrum fuit nobilis. Diod 1, 17 Upon the bankes of Granicus had di'de: Or (captive taken) had attended on His proud foes carre, through streetes of Babylon. If his strong Phalanx, had not calm'd the pride, Of Persian brav'rie, at her highest tide. This strong Battalion stretch'd even to the skies His fame; and to both Seas his victories. So glorious Conquests have beene oft obtain'd, By numbers few, well disciplin'd, and train'd. But mighty multitudes (where skill doth want) Of good successe can very seldom vaunt: For Victorie is coye, and will not bee Forc'd, by rude multitudes; but rather shee Unto a few well Disciplin'd, doth yeeld Her selfe, with all the Honour of the field. Proud Xerxes, whose huge troopes dranke rivers drie And even with lowly plaines, made mountaines high, Did flee from Greece, in a poore fishers boote Who whilome had so many Ships a floote, As made a large Bridge, over Hellespont; That had Leander liv'd, he might upon't Have had a safe recourse, by night, or day, To that faire Towre, where his sweet mistris lay. Worth doth consistt in qualitie alone; Not quantitie: for the small precious stone, Is at high rates, and value ever priz'd; When greater flints, and pibles are despis'd. Even so, the vigour of an Armie stands (Chiefely) in expert, and well order'd bands; And not in throngs of men; whose force unskil'd, Doth rather let, then helpe to winne the field. Old Rome, her Empires Armes had never spred, From high-brow'd Taurus, to Sols wat'ry bed; If that her expert Legions (so oft tride) Could have beene match'd, in all the world beside. Nor did her greatnesse any whit decrease, Untill that antient Discipline did cease, By which shee had, to her first height, ascended; And her wide Empires bounds so long defended. Her Majestie stood free from all decay, While she her thirtie Legions kept in pay. But when sweete Asias womanish delights, Had turn'd her Captaines into carpet Knights: Yea when her Souldiers, and Commanders both, Were wholy given to pleasures, and to sloth; And when true Discipline was laugh'd to scorne; Her naked sides then by her foes were torne. Great boundles minded Caesar (not content, With Conquest of the Westerne continent) Did passe the Seas, to find our Britaines out; Who entertaind him with such courage stout; That (if of skill, there had not beene a lacke) The haughtie Romane had been beaten backe. Nor in those times, when Romes ambition fierce Did search each corner of the universe; Stood we in greatest danger; for Romes hate Is more then trebled toward us, since that. For now the time[s], doe greatest perils shew; So many foes we'have, and friends so few. Needes then must my impartiall Muse commend Those, whom their countries love doth move, to spend Some houres, in Mars his Schoole, where loyall hearts May learne the rule, of Militarie arts. But thou (faire Norwich) by whose stone-rib'd side, The gentle Yare in sandie path doth glide, Creeping along thy meade with a slow pace, As ravish'd with the beautie of thy face: And parted from thee, still his love doth shew With frequent lookes, and softly sigh adue. I praise thy wisedome, and thy prudent care, That art in Peace, providing against warre: As witnesse may that warlike practise bee, Which now is so exactly taught in thee. Oh what a gracefull qualitie it is, To be expert in Martiall properties. The Tennis-court, and bowling grounds smooth face, Compar'd with the Artill'rie yard seeme base. Those great Olimpicke Games, and Isthmian plaies Did never merit such applause, and praise; As doe those Martiall gymnickes in our daies: Those games through ostentation were ordain'd: But ours for publicke weales sake be maintain'd. To know each motion well, and to performe Each title of command, in truest forme: To doe the Muskets Postures dextrously: And nimbly for to let a Bullet fly: With advantageous skill to manage pike: To know [how] to defend, and how to strike, Doth not alone at hand, prevaile in fight, But also doth farre of[f] the foe affright. These warlike principles be not obtain'd All sudainely; but by long practise gain'd; And (being gotten once) are soone forgot; If often exercise preserves them not. For frequent use, and action must supplie The habit; least it in a sudaine die. And like the lampe, be soone extinguish'd quite, When th' oyle is gone that should maintaine the light. The antient French so fierce a people were, And so great conquest got'they every where, That mightie Kings in awe of France then stood, ??? ??????? ????? ????, ??????? ??? ????. Eghnihard Seeking her friendship not her neighbour-hood: When Charles the great in Italy had queld The Lombards: and the Saracens expeld From Spaine: and when the Saxons were compeld To the French yoke their stubborne neckes to yeeld, Dismay'd then were the Easterne Emperours: Yea all the world did then feare Frances force. Much honour likewise did Christs zealous Knight Great Godfrey winne for France; when he did fight His Saviours fields, in those unchristn'd lands, Where his chiefe hopes on frenchmens valour stands But vertues growne t'extreames, breed worse effects. Then ere could have beene caus'd by their defects. For this fierce Nation us'd to Warres, and spoyles, When forraine foes did faile, broch'd civill broyles: That their Kings (for to remedie these harmes) Were forced to forbid the use of Armes Unto the vulgar sort, and them compell'd Or to turne up the bowels of the field, Or for to plie mechanicke faculties; Debarring them from warlike exercise. Thus France her antient reputation lost, Beaten by Sea, and Land, on everie coast. And few I thinke but Frenchmen will denie, That French are Europe[s] basest Infant'rie. Armour for Warre, from the Arsenall is brought, But weapons for the Victorie be wrought In forge of discipline: could furious might, Or strength of brawnie limmes prevaile in fight, Then who could match those huge Patagones, Or buckle with those Westerne Savages Whom Spaine makes slaves: or if activitie Alone could winne a glorious Victorie, Then who could match the Light Numidians That like wild Goates on craggie rockes can dance Then who could match the Kerne or Galloglasse, That on the quaking Boggs as safely passe, As we on firmest plaines: or if the skill Of mannaging a horse at Riders will, Could winne the day, then had not in such sort The French beene slaughtr'd at their Agincourt. Or if by number conquest might be wonne, Then had the Greekes been foyl'd in Marathon. Thus neither horsemanship, nor many hands, Strength, nor activitie, the field commaunds: But the well order'd foote that be refin'd By exercise, and throughly disciplin'd, These alway winne the fortune of the day, For Fortune doth true Fortitude obey. Nor in those elder times (before the Munke, Bertoldus Swartz invented Gunnes, An. Dom. 1380. They were first used by the Venetians. Gord. Invented had his murther-spitting trunke; That plague of valour, height of Hels dispite) Was warlike Discipline so requisite, As now it is: for there's requir'd more skill, To handle well a Gunne, then a blacke bill. Of Policie, order's the soule alone: And Natures very life (that being gone) Things cease to be: for should the golden Sunne Swarve from the course, which he hath wont to runne Roaming at randome up and downe in heaven: Or should the Starres; and those bright Planets seven, Not walke those rounds, which God hath the[m] appointed, Soone should the worlds great fabricke be dis-joynted But a great Armie (where nor Captaines know What to command, nor silly Souldiers how To execute) is like a Galeon Of mightie bulke, ill rig'd, and floating on The surging maine, without sufficient stores Of tackling, ballast, and wave-sliceing ores, With sayles untrimm'd, and wanting at the sterne An expert Pilot, that should well discerne The Chanels course; and know each creeke and cape, And by what point, his course he should forth shape. (Doubtlesse) if Æoles ruffling sonnes should kenne This forlorne vessell, in so weake plight, then From their fierce rage, shee hardly should escape To harbour, without perill of rape. Even so those great Armadoes, that consist Of huge unexpert troupes, and a long list Of mens bare names, doe oft become a prey To their fierce foes, and seldome winne the day. That sonne of Mars, that valiant Epirot, O tresgrand Epirote; O vaillant Albanoys. Dont la main a desfait les Turc. vingt et deux fois. Rowsard. That matchlesse Prince, thrice worthy Castriot, In two and twentie bloudy fights, compeld Huge Turkish Armies, to forsake the field: Nor ever did his greatest strength, and force, Exceed five thousand men (both foote and horse) On order, doth eternitie depend: And Victorie, is Disciplines faire end. Victorie, that blisse of Kings, that sole good Which Warre affords, whose face besmeard with blood, More tempting loves doth to her darlings offer; Then Cleopatr'as lippe, when shee did proffer A courtly Kisse, to great Marke Anthonie; Who with the splendour of her Majestie Was to a Statue strooke, and stood amaz'd, As one that on the Gorgons scalpe had gaz'd. But some there be (I know) that thus object: What need we thus our businesse neglect? What needes this Sturre? this idle exercise? Secure are we, from forraine enemies; Our streetes have in these many yeares not heard The voice of Warre, there's nothing to be fear'd: No inrodes, nor incursions, doe affright Our fearefull Hindes: no out-cries rais'd by night Are signals of approaching foes: no fires Doe crowne our Beacons: and all those are lyers, Which say that Spaine, dares venture for the trie Another Voyage, against Britanie. Let us tend our affaires, confine our selves Unto our Shops; and while the Peasant delves, And rips his Mothers wombe, to find out wealth, Let us grow rich by sleight of tongue, and stealth. While others ply their Militarie Arts, We will be sure to learne to play our parts; To cogge, and foyst, to keepe our measures short, To vent bad Ware, and take good Money for't. Let's cocker up our Wives, and keepe them neate; Raise our selves high with sweete lascivious meate For luxurie: Lets cheate, and cousen all; The pinching Carle, and profuse prodigall. In truth to cheate the wicked no sinne tis; They must be plagu'd for their iniquities. But heare me (friend) thou that hast done more ills, Then ere were punish'd on those wofull Hills, Of mournefull Magdalene: thou who dost thrive By knaverie, and cous'nage; which canst dive Into the depth of craft, to rake for pelfe; And robbe ten thousand, to enrich thy selfe: Thou which dost maske thy crimes, with gestures pure; And think'st th' art safe, so long as th' art secure: Be not deceiv'd: for know thy sinne alone, Deserves nought lesse, then an invasion. But though all forraine enemies should faile; (As Vengeances too small to countervaile Our wickedn[e]sse) the Devill may find out Some daring Ket, in borroughs here about; To plague us, and make pillage of our goods, To fire our houses, and to spill our bloods. If heavens just wrath, should send such punishments; Then who should be best able for defence; But these that be with warlike skill endu'd, To bring in order the rude multitude. And while those dolts, that have but skill enough To weight their plummes, or measure out their stuffe, Shall be unable to obey command; These shall be fit, each one, to lead a band. But suppose that heavens awfull ordinance, Had confin'd Warre, to Germanie, or France: Suppose our Land from broyles should alway bee As safe, as Ireland is from vipers free: Yet is this exercise, and warlike sport, Thrice more praise-worthy, then the Tennis court, Or Bowling Alley, where losse and expences, Breed many discontentments, and offences. Then (worthy Citizens) into whose hearts The wise Prometheus, hath infus'd three parts. Of those pure spritefull flames, which he did steale, From bright Apollos radiant charret wheele; Yee that your private cares can intermit, And spare some houres, for publike benefit: Frequent yee still Bellona's Court, and know More Postures, then can all the Souldiers show; That ere Bloud-thirstie Belgia daign'd to spare From all the furies of a lingring warre But (that your exercise may ever last) Yee must be joyned all together fast, Within the Golden cord, of Unitie: All may enjoy the same immunitie, In place ben[e]ath command: it skils not who The colours beares (so long as theres no foe) That place, or grace, which all alike may merit, (In my conceite) all may by course inherit. Then let no Envie, nor ambitious thought, Breake that societie, which time hath wrought By vertues helpe: let disagreement never, The joynts of your fraternitie dissever: But if foule Discord, that Tartarean elfe, (Who in eternall darknesse, waste[s] her selfe With dire imaginations, and damn'd thought, To bring each worthy exercise to nought) Shall fill your hearts, with the Cadmeian seede Of strife; then let my Muse, with pow'rfull reede, Those mischiefes charme, and repossesse your minds With that respect, which lovely concord binds. So did (of yore) the Thracian Lyrist 'swage, With his concenting notes, the direfull rage Of Greekish youths, when they had forgot quite The golden fleece, for which they went to fight, Each other seeking to deprive of life, So fell was their debate, so great their strife. Discords the bane of things, a poysn'us worme, That doth infest the joynts of States, a storme Which many Common-wealths hath ruined, And many hopefull actions frustrated: Nor can I here, forbeare to interpose Those unauspicious quarrels, that arose, Saladinus etiam Hierosolymam sponte nobis reddidissit, nisi diffidijs nostris cognitis, consilium mutasset. Ex litteris Rich. I. ad Coelest. Betweene stout Cuer de Lyon, and his brother In law, and Armes, who sworne to aide each other, Yet entertaind (in stead of love) deepe hate: And by a separation, tempted fate To the defeate, of their great enetrprise For which proud Philip Richards worth envies, He is requited with as deepe disdaine; And soone (for spite) returnd to France againe: But (if their mutuall vowes they had not broke) Christs Citie then, had cast off Isma'ls yoke. But Concord, is the strength of Warre, in field, And Campe, more forcible, then sword, and shield: Of Conquest, that's the truest augurie; The life of hope, portent of victorie. Faire Belgia had long since beene deflowr'd, By the Hesperian Dragon, and devour'd, Had shee admitted any inbred strife: Concord's her sinewes, bloud, and very life. Her sheafe of arrowes bound together fast, A Lyon with a sheafe of Arrowes in his paw; the Armes of Holland. Are th' auspice of her welfare; which shall last; So long, as doth the rampant Lyon hold, His shafts unbroke: and as (in dayes of old) The wearie Greekes, at Troy found good successe, When they had got the shafts of Hercules: Even so, Scylurus arrowes shall maintaine Scylurue 80 liberos habens moriturus fasciculum iaculorum singulis porrexit, iussu?, rumpere.

The Lombards shee brought into Italy. And on the cheekes of France, and Germany. The bloudie Characters are to be red, The balefull sturres, that Discord there hath bred. Nor doth Apollo any Climate see, That from her malice, hath beene alway free: Then from your brests, drive that Echidna dire (O brave Pretorian band) and with the fire Of sacred love; do Envies eyes out-seare: And from foule Slanders mouth, her tongue out teare Let friendship banish all debate, and strife, And give your exercise both strength, and life. Nor let my gentle Muse alone inspire, Loves sweete consents, but fill'd with that pure fire, Which Phoebus lends his impes, let her high fits, Move noble hearts (as time and place permits) To learne this Art of order, and to know Their Rankes, and Postures perfectly; for now Monstrous abuses routed have the age; And Knaverie rides in Knight-hoods equipage: Few keepe their Rankes; yet in the front stalkes pride And alway takes the right-hand file beside: Shee leadeth on the forlo[r]ne hope, and will (Though shee to Hell-gate march) be formost still. Great evils, with great honours be combin'd And march like Pikes, with Muskets interlin'd. Our Postures are French conges, and few can: Know Mounsieur, from an English Gentleman: So like are we to them, so frenchify'd In garbes and garment: but great God forbid, That our newfangled change should ere declare. Such sad events, as did the Scimitar, Of King Darius: for his Sword alone, A sheath of Greekish fashion, did put on: And then his Magi cry'd, it was a signe, That he to Greece, his Empire should resigne: But we our selves, our gestures, and our swords, In French are drest up; yea our very words Have put on French dissimulation: Oh, blind, absurd, fond, foolish nation, That (light Chamaeleon-like) art what thou see'st; A painted Argos, of all gath'rings piec'd. But are we all transform'd to Woolves, and Apes? Doe none retaine those old Herculian shapes Of Vertue? yes: for God defend, that all Should be Lycanthropiz'd; least heaven should fall. To stop up with her ruines, Sinnes blacke jawes, And crush oppressions unrelenting pawes. No, no: (thankes be to our kinder Starres) yet lives That Vestall flame in many brests, which gives Refreshing heate, to each good enterprise: These helpe old Atlas, to proppe up the skies: These stand (like brazen Colosses) unmov'd By chance, or passion: these never lov'd Informing dogs; nor ere (to fill their purses) Heard Orphanes cryes, or Widowes baleful curses. These neere to any greatnesse did aspire; But Vertue: nor ere sought to be higher In fortunes favour, then in Gods: these scan Worth, by desart; and though they truely can Make good their Gentrie many wayes; such wayes As now the basenesse of the time bewrayes, As large demeanes, great place, or pedigrees; Yet these disdainning that their worth should bee Produc'd from smokie titles, or base pelfe, Or dust, and rotten bones, each from himselfe His worship, or his honour, doth derive; And by his proper actions doth descrive; A Gentleman: for Fortune can't inherit (By right) those graces, which pertaine to merit: And wretched is that Gentrie, which is gotten From their deedes, that long since be dead and rotten. The favour of the Prince, and Fortune, arts, And Ancestrie, are but the outward parts Of true Nobilitie, for her soule is, An harmonie, of vert'ous qualities: But should we search the world (may some replie) From Cales, to Calicut, and sharply prie Both into Universitie, and court; Traverse all Countries, and belay each port, We hardly should meete with so brave a wight. Yes, yes; such be they whose names to recite, My Muse is proud; nor ever shall these want Roome in my Verses (be they nere so scant) For worth as well deserves a Panegyricke, As vice doth Satyrs, or a Thiefe a Diricke, Selfe-wild opinion is, mistaken farre To deeme, that noble vertues praises are Smooth flatteries: and Envie is farre wide To thinke that any baser end can guide A Poets aymes. Although we know those walkes, Where Fortune upon heapes of ingots stalkes, And see her golden Temple dayly full Of sweating Votaries: where Knave, and Gull Have accesse free; and though we well descry, What offrings shee accepts most gratefully: Yet we her Altars shunne, because we know, That many (which her favours buy) doe owe To Justice such hard debts, that mercies bayle Will scarce be found, to save them from hell-Jayle Vaine, foolish Men, although they plainely see All good is there, where grace, and wisedome bee, Yet they of Fortune, doe a Goddesse make, Advancing her to heaven, and for her sake, Dare plunge themselves into a fouler lake: Then Curtius did Romes pestilence to slacke. But (noble Gentlemen) yee that doe hold Faire vertue, at a higher rate, then gold: Yee, whose affections scorne to serve the times, Whose sleepes rue not the harmes, of fore-past crimes, Whose names were neere marked with the privie seale Of Fame, for pilling of the common-weale: Yee that (from Cities tumult severd) know Those sweet contents, which from retirement flow Though not Tiberius-like at Capreae: For privacies, as oft the Midwives bee. Of ils, as good: but yee reserve your leasures For nobler ends, then vaine and flitting pleasures: Nor doe the times bid us securely sleepe, But rather warne us a strong gard to keepe. The East looke[s] blacke with danger, and the South Seemes to invade the North, with open mouth. Our beaten foes their forces now unite, Arm'd with dire mischiefe, rage, and fell despite. But Spaine is poore, and weake (as some replie) Long Warres exhausted have his treasurie. The Netherlands: have drawne his Coffers drie Yet Indian mines (we answere) soone supplie Those wants; for from the Western world doth come His Navie duely, fraught with treasure home. Nor is the Warre maintain'd by Austrian purses Alone: for somewhat beside Buls and curses The Pope allowes, and to the offring cals Many fat Priests, and well fed Cardinals, For whom (though nere so sparing) would stand by And, not helpe to roote out a heresie. Another sort I heare speake better sence: And those relie on Gods omnipotence: Tis true: his mercie onely can us keepe; But if we in our wickednesse still sleepe, And yet suppose that he shall us defend, We miserably erre: what doe protend Our foule prodigious sinnes, but death and warre, Titanicke pride, that God to his face dares. Ramping Oppression, with her hundreth pawes, Abusing to her private gaine the lawes. And Covetise, that with her swinish snout, Rootes up all goodnesse, to find money out. Soft handed sloth, spruce smiling Luxurie, Dull Drunkennesse, swolne-bellyd Gluttonie Unbridled ire, pale Envie, viperous hate; These are the Comets which doe ominate The scourge of Warre; then tis time to repent, Least we too late seeke to shunne the event. Last night, when sweete repose had closd mine eyes, Strange thoughts began my fansie to surprise: For the dull God of sleepe, that hates the morne, And from his gate of Ivorie, and horne, Sends silent troupes of dreames forth everie night, Caus'd horrid Phobetor me to affright, Ovid. Meta. l. II In sundrie shapes: me thought I was transported To a strange Land, such as is not reported By Munster, or old Sir John Mandevile. Nor know I (Certes) whether t'were an Ile, Or parcell of the maine; therein appear'd Great Cities, Townes, and Towres, that seem'd to beard The very clouds; and the soyle seem'd to bee Exceeding fertile: for on every tree The pendant clustres hung, as faire to sight, As the Hesperian fruit: Grapes red, and white, Pomegranates, Limons, Figs, and Oranges, With wondrous plentie, seem'd the field to blesse. Desiring then to see those happie men, That had so faire a Countrie, to dwell in, I to a Citie went, thinking to find The beautifullest race, of all mankind. (But there arriv'd) most strange t'is to be told, What various formes of beasts, I did behold: Nothing like Man saw I there, but huge Apes And hayrie Satires, greedie of foule rapes; Buls, Buffles, Boores, fierce Tygers, Dragons, Dogs, Beares, Camels, Woolves, slow Asses, Horses, Hogs, And Monsters, such as Nilus never bred, Nor Africas foule desarts nourished, Iveery streete did clusters, on each hand, As thicke as Tearme-tid Gallants on the strand. All Birds of prey, and eke all uncleane fowles, Did nestle there; fierce Eagles, Griffons, Owles, Foule Ostriches, and Bats, I there descryd; And earnestly their new guest all these ey'd; That I sore fear'd their entertainement rough, And often wish'd my selfe thence farre enough. While I stood thus amaz'd, an Ape drew neare, Whose age did in his rivelld face appeare. This was their Cities Towne-clarke, it did seeme, For he their onely speaker was I deeme He with a low accoast, thus did me g[r]eete. Stranger (quoth he) I kisse thy happie feete, That brought thee hither, where thou mayst drinke store Of richest draughts, that shall refresh thee more, Then strong Nepenthe; and make thy wits quicker Then can Lyaeus, or the spitefull licour, That Jove, and all the Gods so freely swill'd, The merrie night ensuing Phlegra's, field. Nor let our various shapes, make thee disdaine Our kind societie (my gentle swaine) For although we, the shapes of beasts doe shew, Yet we retaine the minds of men, and know Thrice more content then they: Our Land is clep't Faire Polytheria, where great Circe kept Her court of yore: Circe that awfull Queene, The daughter of the Sunne, who oft was seene To change mid-day, to mid-night, and to cause Æstivall Snowes and breake the vipers jawes. To drive a river backe, to his spring head, To make Seas stand unmov'd, and to strike dead The harvest eare; her cup and wand so mightie, Which made the Fiends obey her great Venite, We stlil reserve: nor doe we deeme the race, Whereof we are deriv'd our meanest grace: From that victorious ancestrie we grow, That did Faire Asias glorie overthrow, In Troyes great ruines: nor were these (I sweare) The baser sort, but such as consorts were Of great Ulysses, on whose name still stickes The honour of Troyes fall; nor need we fixe Our worth aloue on a bare pedigree; Our actions shew what our deservings bee; Which yee men partly know, and must confesse, That we have sent you succour, in distresse. Here was the Ramme bred, that did bring Great Cum liber Pater per desertum Libyae excercitum duceret &amp; siti admodum laboraret; implorasse à Patra auxilium dicitur; Quo facto apparuisse ei ex templo arietem; qui dum fugientem persequitur, peruenisse illo duce ad fontem amaenissimum.

And that thine eye may witnesse what I say; Here follow me: then he leades me away Unto a Castle, whose high towred brow Did checke the winds, and seem'd to over-crow The cloudes: there Lyons, Tygers, Panthers sweete, As tame as fawning Spaniels did us meete. Then to a spacious Hall we came, that stood On pillars of tough Brasse; nor stone, nor wood Were seene in it; and there I pleased my sight With the Picture of the Dulychian Knight: Eurylochus, and he whose braines were wash'd So well with Wine, that life and wits were cash'd Were Pictur'd there, and many a Greeke beside That with Ulysses there did long abide. Faire was the stuffe, but thrice more faire the art, That there was to be seene in every part. While I admir'd here what mine eyes beheld, The Ape brought me a cup with wine up fill'd And bids me drink't; that then I might find grace To see things farre more rare, in that faire place. I in my trembling hand receiv'd the cup, That was of Gold, and dranke the licour up: Then soone the poysons force did touch my braine, And through my body crept in every veine: And while my case I thought to have deplor'd, Thinking to speake my griefes, aloud I ror'd: My hands (I saw) were chang'd to grisly pawes My clothes to shaggie haires; with yawning jawes My mouth did gape; and I perceiv'd my shape Was like a Lyons: then began the Ape With gentle words, to cure my discontent. Good friend (quoth he) thou shalt thee not repent Of thy arrivall here; though thou hast lost Thy former shape, and feature, be not crost: For shrowded in this shape, thou shalt obtaine More knowledge, then did ever mortall gaine. Then by long winding stayres, and walkes he drew me, Unto a spacious roome, where he did shew me, The Vide Artatel. De Magiae.

This was their Counsell-house, wherein they sate Discussing matters, that belong'd to state: Mischiefes, and treason, warre conspiracies, False treaties, stratagems, confed'racies, Were here hatch'd and now hence was comming forth, A plot against the Lyons of the North. The subtile Dragon, and the Griffon fierce That seekes the Empire of the Universe: The Eagle, and the The armes of the Ancient Kings of France were Trees Crapaux Saturne, in a Field Sol. Guil. Toade, were here assembled; To heare whose bloudy projects, my heart trembled: Against the Northerne Lyons they were bent, To use all crueltie, and punishment, For wrongs late done: The Dragon fell doth crie Th' are Heretickes, and therefore ought to die. The Griffon sware, t'was not to be allow'd, That Luth'ranes should their heads in this world shroud. The Eagle wish'd, he never might be bli'st, If ere he spar'd a filthy Calvinist. The spitefull Toad did wish his bones might rot, If ere he ment to save a Huguenot. The Dragon much did praise their readinesse, And promis'd that the action he would blesse, And vow'd he would be lib'rall of his crosses To those brave soules, that durst adventure losses Of lives, or limmes, in that designement; and If any chanc'd to fall, he would command The Angels to transport him presently To heaven, without a Purgatorie. But that the world might not their malice s[c]ent. They meant to cast out tales; that their intent Was to give to Religion, her first grace And puritie: thus with a painted face They masked their devilish end. While I gave eare To their damn'd counsels; I felt a new feare: For from beneath I heard an hideous sound, As if some Earthquake dire had cleft the ground Or Hell her selfe approach to make one In their mischievous consultation. So Neptune scourged with the Northwind rores: Such is the clangour, of a thousand ores Falling at once upon the surging wave: The Witches in their conventicles have Such Musicke, as was this: for t'was the noyse Of the infernall pow'rs, that did rejoyce, To see that Hellish-plot contriv'd, and wrought, That might bring all the world againe to nought. With such obstrep'rous sounds, my sence they strooke, That I sleepes gentle fetters then off shooke, Nor is our danger but a dreame (I feare) So many signes presaging it, appeare. For what can we expect, but sturdy blowes, From our combin'd exasperated foes. Then high time tis fresh courage for to broch When pale-fac'd death and ruine seemes t'approch. (Brave Gentlemen) learne to be prodigall Of bloud; feare nought that may befall But infamie; meete death in any shape, And grapple with blacke danger, though he gape As wide as Hell: know that this life of yours Is but a breath, or blast, or like Mayes flowers Yet never is priz'd at so high a rate; As when tis nobly lost: then animate Your selves with brave example, and shunne not That Fate, which our late worthy heroes got, With endlesse fame to boote. Yea let Spaine know, And never thinke on't, but with horrour, how We children are to those, that did defeate Their great Armada; and them often beate Abroad, and eke at home, and let proud France Review those times, when her Warres did advance Our English Gentlemen. Let that blacke day Of Agincourt, with terrour still dismay Her halfe-dead trembling heart: nor ever let her Expect successe, or any fortune better 'Gainst us: twice with two num'rous Armies shee Anno Do. 1387 Charles 6. with a Navie of 1200 saile, threatned to invade England, having provided such store of Munition &amp; strange engines, as the like was seldome heard of. Anno Do. 1545 The French with an Armie of 60000 men came for England; but feare their entertainment would prove too hote, faintly and friendly they went home againe. Did England treate; yet durst but once scarce see Our pale Cliffes, with her paler lookes, and then Turn'd sterne, and cowardly ranne home agen: If shee the third time, should attempt the like Let the like feares her heart appall, and strike. But (whatsoever betide) t'is meete that we Should stand upon our gard, and ever be Prepar'd, both to make good, our owne defence, And strike our foes: but since experience Is thought our greatest want there must be found A medicine to applie to that deepe wound, Which Discipline is call'd; this wholesome cure Yee Gentlemen must often put in ure; Yee, that have charge of Bands, your dutie tis To traine them up, with frequent exercise. Nor by your Must'ring once, or twice a yeare, Doe yee discharge your duties, but I feare If forraine foes should drive us to our fence, We all should suffer for your negligence. Tis rather fitting, that each Month should yeeld A day, to draw your Souldiers to the field. For our tough Husbandmen, on whom depends Our chiefest strength, so mind their proper ends, That they to weild their Armes have soone forgot, If often exercise enures them not. These with their Bowes, of stiffe, and trustie Eugh The Cavalrie of France oft overthrew. And in one Month more spoyle, and Conquest wonne Then they had thought could in a yeare be done. But now the fierie weapons have cashierd Those ancient Armes, that made our name so fear'd Through all the World, nor hath ease so decay'd Our courage, or our nerves, but by the aid Of Discipline, we may retrive that Fame Which we so lately lost; and rayse a name, That may our bragging foes afresh dismay, More then the name of Spinola doth fray Our women, or our women-hearted men. Nor doe I that old Genovese contemne: He dares doe much, where we dare not oppose: He Conquers all, especially leane foes: If they be fat, they are not for his diet, He rather an whole twelve-month had lie quiet; Till they be famish'd to his hand: what though, He to his fellow Genewayes doth owe Large summes; his Master will pay all tick-tacke, If the Platefleete comes home without a wracke, When that the Towne is wonne: what Towne? Breda By whom wa'st wonne? by Marques Spinola. I scarce beleeve't: then goe and see; for there Upon the gate in scul'pture doth appeare The mem'rie of that famous enterprise. How wonn't he; by assault or by surprise? No: by a famine. In what space? a yeare, Wanting two monthes. What force had he there? Twice twentie thousand men. Then there he spent, More then he got. I, that's most evident. Yet much renowne he had. I, that or nought, Though it at a deare rate King Philip bought. But if Don Ambrose may of Conquest boast, For taking in the Towne, with so much cost, And time, and losse; then what did Heraughiere Deserve; that in one night accomplish'd cleare, A Conquest more compleate, with seventie men; Then he so strong, and so long space could win. As when the cunning Forresters have plac'd Their wel-woven toyles, and heards of wild beasts chac'd Into their snares; yet daring not invade The furious heards, with bore-speare or with blade, For feare of their fell ire; with a strong gard They them surround, and keepe them thus upbarrd, Till pinching famine makes them faint and weake; And then at will their teene on them they wreake. Thus was Breda by Spinola obtain'd. Sharpe famine, not his force, the Citie gain'd. Ostend to ruines turn'd, he wonne at last For Phoebus through the Zodiacke thrice had past. Yet still the Towne held out: some others prate Of his Acts done in the Palatinate, Where few were to resist: yet this is hee That's thought invincible; although wee see His base retreat from Bergen did well shew That he may meete his match sometimes. Tis true: Yet tis not good to thinke our strength so great, That he dares not against us worke some feate. Our craggie Cliffes, we ought not to trust to; Whose hugh Enclosures bound our Iland so. Ambition dares the roaring billowes passe; Of force to raine towres of lasting brasse; Whose cankerd rage we must meete face to face With Spartane hearts (for so requires our case) Since for defence we have no Wals of stone, Our surest gard must be our Wals of bone. And yee, our unkind brethren that affect The faire terme of Catholicke in respect Apostroph. to our Papists. Of your Religion, and with that name, Contend in vaine, to hide your mothers shame; Your Mother Rome, that famous Paramore Of Kings, and Princes, that need Hellebore. Shee (like Semiramis) is wont to kill Her Lovers, when of Lust shee hath her fill. Yee that beneath an English face, doe hood A Spanish heart, preferring forraine good, Before your Englands health; alwayes in hand, Upon the ruines of your native land, To build Spaines Monarchie, and make that Prince A Catholicke in Empire, that long since, Was only fain'd in faith to be the same. But trust yee not the talke of flatt'ring fame. That tels you Spaine is mercifull, and just, Not led by ill desire, or any lust Of domination, to set footing here, Least his false play too soone to you appeare, And yee too late your follies see: let not Utopian joyes your judgements so besot, To make you think that change of Government, The Duke of Medina Generall of the Spanish Forces in 88 said that his sword shold not make any difference betweene Papist or Protestant, so hee could make way for his Master to the Conquest of the Iland. Produceth the most absolute content: Trust not Spaines glosses, but rather conceit What proud Medina said in eightie eight. Spaine for Religion fights (as he pretends) But spoyle, and Conquest, are his mainest ends. When Paris had stolne his light Minion, No lesse then fiftie Kings combin'd in one, Protested, that for this disgracefull rape, Troy should not their severest vengeance scape: Yet was not just revenge the chiefest end Of their designe (whats'ere they did pretend) For each sought to get Helen for a wife, And this indeede was cause of so much strife. Even so your Patrone of Castile protests, That he his Armes puts on, for a redresse Of holy Churches wrongs; when he nought lesse Intends; setting Religion for a stale, To catch the Empire of the West withall. Beleeve it, Conquest is his certaine end; To which, he doth by direst mischiefes tend; To that through Seas of Guiltlesse bloud he wades, Cutting his passage out with murd'ring blades: Or like Amilcars sonne, with flames of fire, Sicut Haniball per Alpes. Liu. And Vinegar, makes way for his desire. (England subdu'd) could yee hope to stand by Secure spectatours of the Tragedy: No, no: though for a time yee might be free, Your lives should make up the Catastrophe. This priviledge perhaps yee might obtaine, That is, to be the last that should be slaine. Then joyne with us; be not so impious, To stand against your Countries Genius. Let us together joyne, with hearts upright, The which shall pray, while our hands ply the fight. Strive not (like Phaetons jades) to overthrow Your Master, least yee also fall as low. Attempt not to unbarre your Countries gate To forraine foes, least yee repent too late Your treacherie, for be assur'd that none Did ever Traitours love (the Treason done.) [43]. A Threnode Upon the Death of those two Honourable Gentlemen, Sir JOHN BURROWES, late Lieutenant of the English Infantrie in the Ile of Ree, and Sir WILLIAM HEYDON, Lieutenant of the Ordinance. The thousand Torch-bearers of Jove, Which mightily to his Bed him light, Where Juno entertaines his love, With merie glee and sweete delight; Were scatter'd all about the skie, That seemed of a Saphires die. All Creatures were at silent rest; Except those wights, whose musing hearts, Some extreme passion did infest, And they were playing then their parts. The Thiefe was plodding on his way, But softly; least the Dogges should bay. True lovers (whom the day divorc'd From sweete discourse) now met and kist: The Witches on their wands were horst, And Luna on their Hearbs downe pist: Nor had the Cocke yet stretched his throte With his all cheering early note. But t'was the time, when Morpheus dull From his two Portals, sendeth out His dreames, that fill mens fancies full With fond conceite, and fearefull doubt, Then I upon my Pillow laid, With drearie thoughts was much dismaid. A strange appearance my mind strooke; Methought I was in Forrest wide, And neere unto a Chrystall brooke, Upon whose greene bankes I descry'd A goodly Lady much distrest, (As by her wofull plight I ghest) A mantle greene shee seem'd to weare; Which by a curious hand was wrought: Townes, Rivers, Mountaines were seene there, And what is in a Lan[d]schap sought: And all the workmanship most fine, A wavie border did confine. Upon her dolefull browes was set A stately Crowne, that did appeare Like to that towred Coronet, Which Cybele was wont to weare. The Roses from her cheekes were fled, Her tresses were disheveled. With teares her eyes beblubberd were, Lamenting sate shee on the grasse: And I 'gan to approach her neere, To find the cause of her sad passe; A drearie spectacle then strooke My throbbing heart, that for feare shooke. For by her side there lay two wights, Whose cheekes were mark'd with deaths pale brand, Who seem'd t'have beene right goodly Knights, Though now they lay low on the Strand, As if they by untimely fate, Had beene brought to that wretched 'state. For one was gor'd with grisly wound, From whence the bloud afresh flow'd out, Which cruddling on the gelid ground. Did cover all the grasse about, The Lady for him sore did weepe, And with her teares his wound did steepe. The other Knight all wanne and pale, With water seem'd all to be smear'd: The drifling drops full thicke did fall, From his bright lockes, and manly beard, As if that Neptune had him slaine, And cast upon the shore againe. Disdaine was fix'd upon his brow, As if he yeelding up his breath, Had scornd that fate which made him bow: But t'was his lucke to drinke his death. While I beheld this sight forlorne, The Lady 'gan afresh to mourne. And with Pearle-dropping eyes up-reard Unto the glittring skie; thus spake: Yee awfull Gods that oft have heard The vowes, and pray'rs which I did make, Upon whose Altars I have left, The spoyles that from my foes were reft. What great offence of mine hath mov'd Your hearts to such impatient ire, To kill those Knights, whom I best lov'd, Whose service I did most desire. Oh fading hopes, oh false delights, Oh joy more swift then Summers nights. (Burrowes) thy valour was a flowre, Whom lightning dire at length did strike. Though it had borne off many a showre. (Heydon) thy worth was Aprill-like, Which had it a faire May beheld, Such flowers had shew'd, as neere did field. Or like a sturdie Ship of Warre, (Brave Burrowes) was thy manly might, Which vessell had beene famous farre, For faire successe in furious fight, Whose sides at last a Canon gor'd, And then the deepes her bulke devour'd. And to a Ship in all her ruffe, New set afloate was Heydon like; Whose [?] the Tritons tooke in snuffe, And under water did her strike. Thus doe the greatest goods flit fast; Some soone, some late; but all at last. Yee Sisters that in darknesse lie, Removed farre from mortall eyne, Where yee that fatall distaffe plie, From whence is drawne Mans vitall twine: What various fates have yee assign'd, To these my Knights, so like in mind. Sweete honours thirst my Burrowes call'd To forraine lands, to seeke for fame; Where he with courage unappall'd, Great toyles, and dangers over-came. There vanquish'd he base fortunes might Griefe, Sicknesse, Age and all despite. Himselfe in Ostend he engag'd, Where Death with Funerals was weary'd. Though Pestilence, and Pellets rag'd, Yet he nor wounds nor sicknesse feared. The noble heart more constant growes. When great perill it selfe shewes. In Frankendale he did oppose The conquering troupes, of Tilly stout Whom he repulst with bloudy blowes, And longer might have kept them out, If it had beene his Soveraignes will That he the Towne should have kept still. His latter Scenes he playd so well, So sweet was his Catastrophe: That Fame shall never cease to tell His worth unto posteritie, Who shall his name among these read, That for their Countries cause are dead. At length he fell: so fals at last The Oke that many stormes hath stood: From paine to Paradise he past. And wonne his blisse with losse of blood. Then let his bones soft lodging have; And let sweete flowres spring on his grave. But my deare Heydon I lament, As doth the tender mother mourne For her yong sonne, untimely shent, That was to some great Fortune borne: The cruell Fates conspir'd his death, When first he drew an Infants breath. Oh, Froward Fate that giv'st good parts, Yet dost envie men should them shew. So chance to many, goods imparts, But grace to use them, unto few. (Aye me) that Death the greatest ill, Should greatest vertues alway kill. Grimme Mars, and Mercurie did sit As Lords, at thy Nativitie. Mars gave the valour, Hermes wit; But both an wofull destinie. They at thy worth repin'd my Knight And did cut short thy life for spite. Even as moyst Zephyre powers downe fast His showres on the new sprouted rose, That it her blossomes soone doth cast, And all her fragrant odour loose: So Heydon in his prime was strooke: Betimes his vigour him forsooke. Accursed ever be that Ile That beares the Holy Bishops name, Which did me of my Knights beguile: Let warre and spoyle, nere leave the same Nor ever let the forraine yoke Be from her servile shoulders broke. Let gastly Ghosts frequent her plaines, Let night hags there be heard to rore: Let Syrens dire with drearie streames, Make Saylors shunne that balefull shore. Let thunder stricke their Vines amaine, By thunder was my Burrowes slaine. And let those deepes, that guiltie are Of Heydons bloud, be turn'd to shelves, That them t'approach no ships may dare, For feare to cast away themselves. O let ten thousand ills betide Those places, where my worthies di'd. (This said) a grievous sigh shee drew, As if her heart-strings would have split; And on the earth her-selfe shee threw; That for to see her piteous fit, The Dryads wept, the Satyrs lowr'd, And water Nymphes their teares forth powr'd. The Trees did sigh, the Hils did grone The bubling Brooke did sobbe a maine, And Echo made a pitious mone, That I could not from teares refraine The Birds with her in consort joynd, And sought in vaine to ease her mind. The Nighting-gale, on wither'd brakes, These drearie threnodes forth did powre: Wealth, beautie, strength (quoth shee) Time takes; And Death approacheth every howre. But Vertue endlesse life imparts. Then live for ever (noble hearts.) The Swanne mov'd with her plaints drew neere, And thus began to sing his last: No setled state of things is here; Our lives, our joyes are but a blast. But Sunnes that set faire, so shall rise: Oh happie Death; and so he dies. The Turtle true with heavie cheere, Sob'd forth her mournefull Elegies O Death (said shee) that slu'st my deare, Now boast not of thy Victories: Thy paines are joyes, thy darts are cures Thy wounds are life, that alway dures. I had but heard her dittie out, When that the Cocke whose Sants bell cleere Should call mens hearts to thoughts devout. Made me from sleepe my eyes to reare, Upon my dreame I mused then; And when day came, it downe did pen. FINIS. [44] Upon the death of Sir RALPHE SHELTON. I am what, passion will: a stone, or tree: A mad Hercuba or sad Niobe. For who can see such ruines, and not feele A marble chilnesse creepe from head to heele: Like sad Electra that could not abide To see Troy Urn'd: but her pale face did hide. Or Phoebus-like that brooks not to behold The Thyestaean dainties, but did fold His head in Pitchie cloudes, so loathes my eye To be spectator of this Tragedie; Wherein, thou Shelton no meane person werst And did'st so to the life well act thy part That we lament thy exit, and give thee, Sad sighes, instead of a glad plaudite. Yet shall not griefe so prejudice thy worth, But fame shall sing alowd thy praises forth To checke the pride of France; who in thy fate, Lost three for one: it at so deare a rate Thou sold'st; yet was it cheape to them (I sweare) Out valuing more lives, then they had there. Thy life, and death were fatall both alike To France: first in a Duell didst thou strike French braverie downe; and boldly trodst upon The dustie Plumes, of that proud Champion, That durst thy valour tempt: with thine owne hands, Thou paidst thy owne revenge; which ever stands Huge Columne-like, to counter-checke the pride Of France; and shew how bravely Shelton dy'd. RHODON AND IRIS. A PASTORALL, AS IT WAS PRESENTED at the FLORISTS Feast in Norwich, May 3, 1631. Urbis &amp; orbis gloria Flora. [1] To the right Worshipfull, M?. NICHOLAS BACON of Gillingham, Esquire. Yet though the worke doth crave nor Bayes, nor Cedar, But the mild censure of a gracious Reader. This to the proudest Criticke I dare tell, It feares nor Frankincense, nor Mackerell; Nor terrible Tabacco, that consumes Atlanticke volumes in his smoth'ring fumes. [2] To his much respected friends, the Society of Florists. But some there be that are so pure and sage, That they doe utterly abhorre a Stage, Because they would be still accounted holy, And know, the Stage doth oft bewray their folly. You could but wonder to see what distaste They tooke, to see an Hypocrite uncas'd: Oh had they power, they would the Author use As ill as Bacchus Priests did Orpheus. [3] To the Booke and his worthy friend the AUTHOR. Disperse and vindicate thy Makers merits, Late disesteem'd by Lynx ey'd censuring spirits; Whose captivated judgements now may see, In this cleere glasse their owne deformitie; Whose malice found no cause to disrespect Thy worth, but 'cause it past their intellect: My barren Muse cannot to life set forth Thy abstruse poesie, learning and worth: Th' abilities which in thy bosome lye, Will be admired of posterity: Wer't thou but truely knowne, thy worth would raise Thee and thy Muse: best Poets would with bayes Crowne thy rich temples, and maugre thy will, Would place thee highest on Parnassus hill. Blest be their names, thy Nectar Genius nourish: By such, dejected poesie shall flourish. Let no Agnostus dare to read thy lines, Th' are made for those can judge of high designes. In unknowne waters lest I wade too farre, Let thy bright rising sunne eclipse my starre. RI. PERT. [4] To his friend the Author. May none but Phoebus kisse thy lines with sight, Hee'l doe thee right. Tis not for mortals once to dare to scanne, Thy height 'bove man This speakes thy fellowship with supreme gods, There's naught puts oddes, But lifes eternitie: tush, thy lines shall be, A saintlike canon of thy memory. Be bold then to the world, and dumbe that tongue That dares thee wrong: Yet thus give leave to vulgar braines to clap Agnostus cap Upon their heads, whose braines doe much lesse crave, Then I deprave. Scorne blast their dwellings, in simplicity That spit their poyson; none shall venome thee. WILLIAM DENNYE. [5] To his friend the Author. I cannot but admire this Worke of thine, (Right worthy Author) that me thinkes each line Should gaine attention from a well tun'd Eare, And please the Eye of any shall appeare, That apprehends it: alwayes Ile attend To wish this Worke well, as a faithfull Friend.

Candid spectators, you that are invited To see the Lilly and the Rose united; Consider that this Comedy of ours, A Nosegay is compos'd of sundry flowers. Which we selected with some small expence Of time, to please each one that hath a sence: But if this glorious Cynicke crowne containes A head that wants a competence of braines, We could desire his absence, and be glad That one more wise his seat or standing had: Because experience shews that such as he, The greatest enemies to science be: For what the Noddy cannot understand, He will seeke to disparage underhand, Branding eternall lines with blacke disgrace, Because they doe his numbers smothe surpasse. For this bold Criticke would have the world know it, That he no small foole is, though a small Poet. But with Icarean wings, why strives he thus, To mount Parnassus tops with Pegasus? When 'tis most meet that he with Asses meeke His pasture at the Mountaines feet should seeke, On thistles wilde, and brakes there let him knabble, While Pegasus does make the skies his stable. But you (judicious friends) that well discry The strength and worth of noble Poesie; That can discreetly judge of what is done, We crave your favour and attention, And shall applaud the fortune of our Muse, If ought worth your acceptance we produce. ACT. 1. SCEN. 1. Poneria, Agnostus. Ag. Is the worlds eye not yet asleepe? Po. Hath Jove not yet put on his starry night-cap? No; nor Juno her spangl'd smocke? Ag. What, hath Hesperus forgot to light heavens tapers up? Or be the Charret wheeles of Night o're loaden with the leaden waights of sleepe, That she delayes to throw her misty veyle upon the face of things? Po. Blind Ignorance that grop'st in Cymerian darknesse, That lyest invelop'd in the shad[e]s of everlasting night, That want'st those glorious spectacles of Nature, Those Chrystalline spheres that should illumine Thy Microcosmus, Why dost thou thus maligne the guiltlesse light, She being the fairest Creature that Nature ever made? Ag. I hate her because she is light: I say she is The Mistris of disquiet and unrest, and breeds More troubles in the world then one of my young Hungry Lawyers doth in a Common-wealth, Or a schismatical selfeconceited Coxcombe in an antient Corporation. Oh that I could Ulysses-like burne out the eye Of that Celestiall Polypheme; Or raise dull Chaos from Demogorgons Cell To quench the worlds unnecessary luminaries. Po. Bold Ignorance, thou Idoll of these times That o're a woollen wit, oft wear'st a sattin Cap; And sometimes at our Bacchanalian feasts Appear'st as brave as a Canonicall Saint In a Kalender: I hug thy resolution, stupid divell, That dost with generous malice amply supply What is defective in thy intellect: But if thou'lt give my faithfull Counsell leave For to divert the torrent of thy wrath, Then lend a facile eare to my advice. Bend not thy bootlesse hate against that Orbe of light, Whose mighty flames will scorch the impious wings Of those Nocturnall birds, that shall attempt With talons most prophane, to injure his bright beauty. A meaner object than this, shall satisfie Thy wrath, and my displeasure. This is the day whereon the new society of Florists, have determined to keepe their annual festivals: Whose pompous Celebration hath wont to eclipse All feasts besides: th' Olympian games, And Isthmian playes, with all those Ludicrous And Ludibrious Combats, are but meere Puppet playes To this grand feast, for Art and nature both have try'd To make this Feast surpasse all feasts beside. Unite thy force with mine, then ten to one We shall disturbe their mirth, e're we have done. Ag. Then mischiefe lend me all thy guilty nerves: Let flames of boundlesse fury quite dispell Lethaean dulnesse from my Clouded braine. Assist our great designe, ye subterraneous powers, That utterly abhorre to view the glaring light: Let not the weakenesse of my Craz'd intellectuals, Nor yet this loath'd deficience of my sense, Be prejudiciall to the bent of our designe: Poneria, act thy part, for I am thine. Exeunt. SCEN. 2. Rhodon, Acanthus. Aca. (Rhodon) my honor'd, soule-united friend Cast off that dusky melancholy veyle. Too vile a robe for thy majesticke brow, Blast not the pride of Hyblas happinesse With thy offensive passion. Rho. Nay, good Acanthus, did love ere offend any? Aca. And art not thou the map of loves calamity? Witnesse those cristall bowles of thy bright eyne, Which I have seene sweld up with brinish teares, Prepar'd for sorrowes bitter beverage: Witnesse those frequent tempests of thy sighes, Which made thy brest a fiery sea of dolour: Witnesse those palled cheekes, whose glorious hue Aurora late envy'd, and quite despairing To reach thy beauties height, with Cupid treated, And him suborn'd to wound thy generous heart, (Which no base passion ever durst assault) That now like pale Narcissus on the brinke Of the beguilding streame, thou lyest a dying. Rho. I tell thee (brazen Colosse) marble statue, Whose heart loves darts could never penetrate; Love is the Prince of all affections, And like the element of fire transcends His brothers in activity and splendour. Aca. It is a fire indeed, that doth consume All vertuous actions; that feeds upon mens soules Like the fiend Eurynomus upon dead carkases; That makes the microcosmus a meere Chaos. It is the Remora of all noble enterprises, And the Lernaean fenne which breeds a Hydra, Crested with a thousand inconveniences. Let me nere inherit more then my Fathers hempland, Or nere be owner of more wit then some elder brothers, If I think not Cupid the most pernicious deity Among all the Olympian Senators. Oh that I had but Stentors lungs, To thunder out the vanity of that idoll. Rho. Now I hope you have rail'd your self out of breath, And therefore I may now have time to speake: Thus 'tis, deare friend Acanthus, I confesse That once I lov'd the Lady Eglantine, Whose rare endowments both of art and nature, Well corresponding with high birth and fortune, Did moderately attract my sincere love, Which love conspiring with a strong desire, To see the Customes of some forraine Nations, And know the manners of people farre remote, Made me to greet the Princely Dame With a personall visitation. Then my indulgent starres did me advise, For to suspend my suit: whose Counsell I obey'd. But trust me, friend, thou wert too much mistaken, To thinke that love had scorch'd or sing'd so much The wings of reason; that I must needs fall, And perish in the fornace of despaire. Thou art a bad constructer of my thoughts, If that thou think'st 'tis love which makes me sad: Yea, thou, oft-times, dost take thy marks amisse, To think me sad; perhaps, when as my minde (Uprais'd above the sphere of terrene things) Is ravish'd with Celestiall Contemplation; For earthly passion hath no power at all To worke upon an elevated soule. Passions are starres to lower orbs confin'd; Scorching an earthly, not a heavenly mind. Yet am I not so much a Stoicke, or a Stocke, To plume the pinions of th' immortall soule, Who while she's Cloyster'd in this Cell of Clay, Moves with the wings of the affections: But lest she, like to heedlesse Icarus, Should soare too high a pitch; or like young Phaeton, Should shape her Course too low, Jove hath appointed Wise Vertue for to regulate her flight. Of these affections, love the Empresse is; Who, while she stands submisse to reasons lore, Doth keepe the Fabricke of the little world in frame. Love is the geniall goddesse, the Lucina Which doth produce each honourable atchievement, Which this true axiome evidently proves, Nobilitas sub amore iacet. Had not the spritefull flames of love, egg'd on That Theban Kilcrow mighty Hercules. To brave adventures; he, perhaps, had dy'd As much inglorious as did base Thersites. Had not the faire Andromache beheld, From Trojan Towers, Hectors valiant acts Among the Greeks, amid the Phrygian fields; The gallant Dames of Troy then might, perchance, Most justly have preferr'd Achilles farre before him. Tis this heroicall passion that incends The sparkes of honour in each noble minde; Making dull sluggards study industry; And animating each unlearned head To toyle in Arts and liberall Sciences, Even to the high degree of rare proficience. Then cease Acanthus with thy lawlesse tongue, True loves Condition to maligne or wrong. Ac. Thou zealous patron of the winged Boy, Well hast thou pleaded thy blind Archers Case; Pray Jove thou maist deserve a lusty fee For this Herculean labour of thy tongue. Rho. Surcease these malapert invectives, friend, Cupid is arm'd with fire and arrowes keene, To be avenc'd on those that shall him spleene. Ac. When Sol shall make the Easterne Seas his bed, When Wolves and Sheepe shall be together fed; When Starres shall fall, and planets cease to wander, When Juno proves a Bawd, and Jupiter a Pander; When Venus shal turn Chast, and Bacchus become sober, When fruit in April's ripe, that blossom'd in October; When Prodigals shall money lend on use, And Usurers prove lavish and profuse; When Art shal be esteem'd, and golden pelfe laid down, When Fame shal tel all truth, &amp; Fortune cease to frown To Cupids yoke then I my necke will bow; Till then, I will not feare loves fatall blow. Rho. Wert thou a meere spirit, then I confesse, And thinke, this resolution might endure; But so long as thy soule weares robes of earth, Lac'd all with veynes, that o're a Crimson deepe, Set forth an Azure bright; needs must thy heart Yeeld to the force of Cupids golden dart. [Exeunt.] SCEN. 3. Clematis, Eglantine. Cle. Oh impotent desires, allay the sad consort Of a sublime Fortune, whose most ambitious flames Disdaine to burne in simple Cottages, Loathing a hard unpolish'd bed; But Coveting to shine beneath a Canopy Of rich Sydonian purple; all imbroider'd With purest gold, and orientall Pearles; In tesselated pavements, and guilded roofes, Supported by proud artificiall Columnes, Of polish'd Ivory and Marble; doth love delight There; doth he, like a mighty Tyrant, rage, Subverting the whole edifice of reason With his impetuous conflagration: That this is true, the gentle Shepheardesse Faire Eglantine doth evidently shew: For she, a sister to the great Cynosbatus, Was Courted lately by the Shepheard Rhodon: Whose suit she entertain'd with due respect, Requiting love with love: but Fate (it seemes) Not condescending that great Hymen should Accomplish their desires; forbade the Banes, And Rhodon hath relinquished his suit; And is return'd to Hybla sweet; whose flowry vales Began to droope, and wither in his absence. But Eglantine remaines disconsolate; Like to a Turtle that hath lost her mate. See where she comes, expressing in her face A perfect Map of mellancholy: I will retire, because I well descry, Shee's out of love with all society. Enter Eglant. with her Lute. Eg. Addresse thy selfe sweet warbling Instrument, My sorrowes sad Companion; to tune forth Thy melancholly notes; somewhat to slake Those furious flames that scorch my tender heart. She sings and playes upon the Lute. Upon the blacke Rocke of despaire My youthfull joyes are perish'd quite, My hopes are vanish'd into ayre, My day is turn'd to gloomy night: For since my Rhodon deare is gone, Hope, light, nor comfort, have I none. A Cell, where griefe the Landlord is, Shall be my palace of delight; Where I will wooe with votes and sighes, Sweet death to end my sorrowes quite; Since I have lost my Rhodon deare, Deaths fleshlesse armes why should I feare? Enter Cle. Cle. What time shal end thy sorrowes, sweetest Eglantine? Egl. Such griefe as mine cannot be cur'd by time. But when the gentle fates shall disembogue My weary soule, and that Celestiall substance free From irkesome manacles of clay; then may I finde, If not a sweet repose in blest Elysium, Yet some refrigeration in those shades, Where Dido and Hypsiphile do wander. Exit Egl. Cle. Thou gentle goddesse of the woods &amp; mountains, That in the woods and mountaines art ador'd, The Maiden patronesse of chaste desires, Who art for chastity renowned most, Tresgrand Diana, who hast power to cure The rankling wounds of Cupids golden arrowes; Thy precious balsome deigne thou to apply, Unto the heart of wofull Eglantine; Then we thy gracious favour will requite With a yong Kid, than new falne snow more white. Exit. SCEN. 4. Cynosbatus, Martagon. Cy. My honor'd friend, most noble Martagon, Who whilom didst with thy imperiall power Command the mountaines proud, and humble plaines Of happy Thessaly: who hath eclips'd The splendour of thy light, and clipp'd those wings That did ore-shade these fields from East to West. Each Shepheard that was wont to feed his flocks Upon these fertile meads, was wont whilere To pay the tribute of his primest lambs. But now as one coup'd in an angle up, Thou art compell'd to satisfie thy selfe, With a small portion of that soveraignty Which thou didst earst enjoy. Ma. Deare friend Cynosbatus, if that the world Had bin compos'd in a cubicke forme And not orbicular; or if this globe Were destin'd to be ought else then fortunes ball, By alterations racket banded to and fro; Then justly might'st thou wonder to behold My present state, so short of my precedent height. Nor doth this monster, Change, beare sway alone, Ore elements, men, beasts, and plants, But those celestiall bodies that are fram'd Of purer constitutions, are compell'd To be obedient to her awfull doome. Reare up thy eyes unto the spangl'd cope, And there behold Joves starre-enchased belt, The glittering Zodiacke wonderfully chang'd In a few thousand yeares: For those fixt stars, which like a Diamond cleare, Adorne the baudricke of the Thunderer, Have wander'd from their former stations. Witnesse the golden Ram who now is gone astray, And shoulder'd hath the Cretian Bull; and he Those twins of Jove so sore hath butted, That they have crush'd the Crab, and thrust him quite Into the den of the Nemaean Lyon. Thus by the change of these superiour bodies, Strange alterations in the world are wrought, Great Empires maim'd, &amp; Kingdoms brought to naught. And that auspicious lampe, who freely lends His light to lesser fires, the prince of generation, Even Sol himselfe, is five degrees declin'd, Since learned Ptolome did take his height. But if Egyptian wisards we may trust, Who in Astrologie wont to excell; By them tis told, that foure times they have seene That glorious Charrioter flit from his place: Twice hath he rose (they say) where now he sets, And Twice declined where he now doth rise. If these Celestiall powers, whose influence Commands terrestriall substances, Be object to mutation, then needs must Sublunar things, submit themselves to change. Then wonder not good friend Cynosbatus, To see my state and power diminish'd thus. Cy. Tis true deare Martagon, experience showes That alteration every day brings forth A new birth of effects. Ma. But I prethe friend, satisfie me in one thing. Cy. My bosome's yours, take from that Cabinet The choisest secret that can pleasure you: Tell me in what your will's to be resolv'd. Ma. There is a rumour spred through Thessaly, That your faire sister, Madame Eglantine, Shall be espoused to the Shepherd Rhodon, The prince of all the Swaines that dwell on Hybla. Cy. From no ill grounds this rumor sprang, though The Fates did crosse what was by us intended. Ma. Then there's no expectation of my Nuptial rites. Cy. No; all's dissolv'd. Ma. I thanke my Starres for that. Cy. Your reason, Noble friend. Ma. A kin he is to that male spirited Dame, That stout Virago, that proud Shepheardesse Call'd Violetta: who complaines of wrongs Late suffer'd at my hands: And hee's the man by whom she hopes To be aveng'd on me, for this pretended injury; And had he matcht your sister, sweet Eglantine, Then might I have had cause for to suspect Your love not to be sound, since you accepted So great a foe of mine, for your neere friend. Cy. Then I am glad the Fates would not agree That I should lose so true a friend as thee. Exeunt. SCEN. 5. Rhodon, Anthophotus, Acanthus, Iris, Panace. An. Never till now, did my Hymettus flourish: More blest effects hath thy sweet presence wrought, (Honour'd Rhodon) then could have beene produc'd By moist-wing'd Zephyrus, or Favonius, Who fanns our flowers with his gentle breath. Rho. Thankes, good Anthophotus: An. Nor doth our sister Iris hold her selfe Meanely engag'd to you, for this your gracious visit. Rho. To be the meanest servant of so sweet a saint, Is the full height and scope of my ambition. Ir. Faire S?. I wish you would be pleas'd t'imploy Your service on an object of more worth. Rho. Dissemble not, admired Shepheardesse; For thou art she, that art as farre beyond That light peece of beauty, Hellen of Greece, In outward perfections; as shee was short of thee in inward graces. Yea, had those fifty Kings that did for her Engage themselves in a long tedious warre, Seene but the Modell of thy rare beauty, Drawne by the hand of but a rude painter, Doubtlesse, they had their honours forfeited, And broke that sacred oath which they had tane. Their worke in hand they had relinquish'd quite, And left the walls of wretched Troy untoucht; For each attracted with thy beauties splendor, Nor Seas nor perils would have left unpast, To finde thee in the furthest angle of the world. Ir. Could my perfections, valu'd at the highest rate, But countervaile a dramme of your great worth, Then should I think my selfe borne under starres Most happy and auspicious. An. Surcease your Complements, deare Rhodon, Let empty Caskes, and hollow Cymbals speake That ayrie language, which unworthy is Of your reallities. Rho. Pardon me, gentle Sir: this radiant starre, My judgements feeble eyes did dazle so, That I was forc'd to speake what passion did informe me. Enter a Messenger. Messen. Which is the Shepheard Rhodon? Rho. I am the man. Messen. Then you are he whom Violetta greets. Rho. How fares my sister? Messen. This letter shall relate what I can never utter. Exit Messen. Rho. Pray Jove we have good newes, me thinks I saw A pallid horrour setl'd in the face Of the sad Messenger: be't good or ill, We are resolv'd to see it, come what will. He opens and reads the Letter. I Violetta much distrest By Martagon my mortall foe, Your succour humbly doe request, To set me free from servile woe. Our flowers he hath trampled on, Our Gardens turn'd to thickets wilde; Our fields and Meads he hath ore-run, That we are forc'd to live exil'd. We therefore doe your aide implore, Us to our freedome to restore. Your distressed sister, Violetta, Violetta. 'Twas for no good, that the late shag hair'd Comet With his erected staring lookes, did over-looke Our frighted flocks, who all amaz'd poore wretches At such a horrid unexpected sight, Ere Hesperus gan from the west to peepe, Halfe empty, did retire unto their folds againe: Nor were those idle fires which late we saw, Hang like a flaming canopie above us, When we did walke the round about our folds, To keepe the warwolfe from our Lambs by night. But is't possible that man should be so savage, To vent his rage upon a silly woman? An. It is no wonder gentle sir at all: For when Prometheus form'd his man of clay, Tis said that he did to his stomacke adde, The raging fury of a Lyon fierce. Rho. Tis true: but histories report that a Lyon did, The suppliant Getulian virgin spare; Scorning to make so innocent a creature His pray or quarry. An. Foule shame and infamy it is, god wot That manly might should women weake oppose, Whom they by right for life ought to defend. Acan. (Rhodon) doe thou but say Amen: and I will in An instant raise our spritefull youth, And lead them on with such a vigorous force Against the most unhumane Martagon; That we will pull the Craven from his nest, Disrobing him of all his borrowed plumes, And repossessing Violetta of her owne. Rho. In actions of such consequence as this, We must not be too precipicious, Mature deliberation must conclude What shall be done in such a maine designe: The stately Steed that with a full careere Attempts to mount the brow of the steepe hill, Oft breaks his winde, ere he can reach the height. But the slow snayle without or harme, or perill, In time ascends unto the mountaines top, For that true love we owe to Thessaly, In which affection all we are ingag'd; We by a friendly treaty will endevour To bring th' usurper to a restitution. But if the Olive branch will doe no good, Then let the scourge of warre it selfe disclose; They that our friendship scorne, must be our foes. An. And if my right hand faile to second thee, Then for a Peasant let me counted be. Exeunt Rho. Antho. Iris. Panace offers to goe out, and is stayed by Acanthus. Ac. Nay, stay faire Nimph, I would request A private Conference with you. Pa. If that I could with my affaires dispense, I gladly should imbrace your Conference: But my occasions bid mee hast away; Sweet S?, adieu; I can no longer stay. Exit Pa. Ac. I that of late was made of Scythian snow, And Hyperborean ice, am now quite thaw'd In the uncessant flames of hot desire. A new Vesuvius burnes within my brest, But shall I overturne those noble trophies Which I most firmely have on vertue founded; Or shall I singe the wings of reason so, In the outragious flames of passion; That I must needs fall downe and perish quite In the blacke hideous gulfe of deepe despaire, No: no: I will not, Of this I am resolv'd whatso're befall, Or not to love too much, or not at all. Exit. ACT. 2. SCEN. 1. Poneria, Agnostus. Po. Bold foolish wickednesse is that Which walks by day, expos'd to the world's eie. Sinne is the daughter of the darkest night, And therefore doth abhorre to come to light. Give me that cole blacke sinne that can lye hid. Under the candid robes of see[m]ing sanctity; Which dares put out the perspicacious eyes Of those that shall attempt to find her out. Come dull Agnostus, let us disguise our selves And be prepar'd to act some stratagem To eclipse the glory of these festivals. She puts on the garment. This robe of vertue doth belong to me; This goodly vaile shall hide my blacke intents. Thus personated, I durst undertake To rend a well woven state in factious peeces; To win the eares of mighty Potentates; And hood-winke Kings, that they should neither see To doe what's just, nor heare the pitteous cryes Of those that are opprest. But that thou, Agnostus, maist second my designes, 'Tis very fit thou shouldst be thus accouter'd. Ag. My deare Poneria, I am yours. Shee puts on his beard. Po. Then first unto thy chin we apply This Philosophicall beesome. Now is the old proverbe really perform'd, More haire than wit. How like a Senator he lookes? What a world of gravity's harbour'd in that beard? Surely the world can take him for no other Than the third Cato that should fall from Heaven. But here's the Ensigne of learning, The badge of the seven Liberal Sciences, Operculum ingenij, the silken Case of wit, The Cap of knowledge; Clap this upon thy Empty hogshead, put this on, and then thy head Will become a Helicon, and thy braine a Pyrene. He puts on the Cap. Ag. It fits me exceeding well. Po. Dost not perceive thy head begin to ake With meere abundance of knowledge? Ag. Now, me thinks, I could confute a Colledge of Divines, A Synod of Doctors, a Lycaeum of Philosophers; Yet me thinkes my braines are not right, And somewhat too weake to maintaine a paradox. Po. Away fond idiot, doe not conceit That this Cap can infuse any thing reall into thy pate, That is uncapable of all art and science. Under the protection of this Cap, thou maist be bold To traduce thy betters, to censure the best, To decide controversies without discretion, To torment all companies with thy discourse, And weary eares of yron with thy impertinences; Doe but weare this head-peece over the Coyfe of Selfe-conceit (alwayes provided) that thou forget'st Not to leave off a brazen face; and I dare Undertake it, thou in a short time, shalt gaine More respect (especially among Plebean Coxcombs) Then ever Pythagoras, had of his auditors. Ag. I am thy slave, divine Poneria: Oh admirable rare Artist that I am! Po. But yet, me thinkes, there's somewhat else to doe To make thee more accomplish'd and compleat. 'Slight, the politicall gowne; I had as cleane forgot it, As the time since I lost my mayden head. Here 'tis: dispatch, and put it on, And then be reputed both grave,— Learn'd, and wise. Doubtlesse it will become thee exceeding well. He puts on the Gowne. Now lookes he not like a maine stud of a Corporation? Ag. How heavy is the burthen of authority? Po. 'Tis true, authority is heavy, I confesse, But not so heavy but an Asse may beare't. Since now, Agnostus, that we are well fitted With habits meet, to act what we intend; Thou seeming like a grave and learned Sire; Though thou indeed then that bee'st nothing lesse, And I like to a vertuous maiden dight, Though I all vertue deeply doe abhorre; We thus disguis'd, will all the world delude, And set the flowers at ods among themselves, That they in civill enmities embroyl'd, Shall of their pride and gloryes be dispoyl'd. Exeunt. SCEN. 2. Martagon, Cynosbatus. Ma. To hinder the conjunction of those starres, We must try all our skill, Cynosbatus. Cy. I jealous am of their maligne aspect, And therefore hold it best to take away That cause which may produce such bad effects; For I shall never cease t'applaud his skill, That in the shell, the Cockatrice doth kill. Ma. The Serpent will be hatch'd, I shrewdly feare, E're we the mischiefe can prevent, if thus We should delay to act our purposes: For late, a certaine rumor, through my eare, Did strike me to the heart; when 'twas reported That Rhodon on Hymettus hill was seene; Where by Anthophotus, and his sister Iris, He was with such solemnity receiv'd, That all surmise there is a match intended Betweene the Shepheard Rhodon and faire Iris. Cy. If once they be conjoyn'd in Hymens rites, Then all our toyle's ridiculous and vaine; For Hymens obligations are (we see) Seldome by any cancell'd, but by death. Ma. Then let us set some Stratagem abroach, The Cords of their new amity to breake. The tender twig may easily be broke, But who's so strong to bow the sturdy Oke. Our friends will say (if we procrastinate) That, like the Trojans, we were wise too late. Exeunt. SCEN. 3. Eglantine sola. Since that the gods will not my woe redresse, Since men are altogether pittilesse, Ye silent ghosts unto my plaints give eare; Give eare (I say, ye ghosts) if ghosts can heare: And listen to my plaints that doe excell The dol'rous tune of ravish'd Philomel. Now let Ixions wheele stand still a while, Let Danaus daughters now surcease their toyle: Let Sisyphus rest on his restlesse stone, Let not the Apples flye from Plotas sonne; And let the full gorg'd Vultur cease to teare The growing liver of the ravisher; Let these behold my sorrowes, and confesse Their paines doe farre come short of my distresse. Were I but Lady of more wealthy store Then e're the Sunne beheld; or had I more Then Midas e're desir'd; I would (in briefe) Give all to be deliver'd from this griefe. Rocks of rich Indian pearle, shores pav'd with gemmes, Mountaines of gold, and Empires Diadems, These would I give, yea, and my selfe to boot, My selfe and these prostrating at his foot, To enjoy him whom I so dearely love. Aye me, fond love, that art a sweet sower evill, A pleasant torture, a well-favour'd devill. But why doe I, weake wretch, prolong my griefe? Why doe I live, since death affords reliefe? Doe thou (sweet ponyard) all my sorrowes ease, That art a medicine for all grievances, Assist my hand, thou goddesse of revenge, That on my selfe, I may my selfe avenge. Enter Poneria and Agnostus. Po. Hold, hold thy hand, faire Shepheardesse, Attempt not to commit a fact so horrid. Eg. What Fury sent you hither, Caitiffes vile, Thus to prolong my sorrow, and my toyle. Po. No Fury, but your happy Genius Brought us to these uncomfortable shades, For to prevent your mischievous intent. Eg. Death is a plaister for all ills (they say) What mischiefe then can be in death, I pray. Po. 'Tis true; death is a mortall wound that cures all wounds Of body, and of mind: it is the soules potion That purgeth her from corporall pollution. But you must not your owne Physician prove, Nor be the Doctor, and the Patient too: For if thy soule be sickly, and grow weary Of this unwholesome earthly habitation, Because this ayres spissitude suits not With her Celestiall Constitution, She must not like a bankrupt Tenant prove, That flyes by night from an unprofitable Farme, Before the terme of his Lease be expir'd: But stay till heaven shall give her egresse free Unto the haven of rest and happinesse. Eg. Were I not plunged in a grievous plight, Perhaps I would not thinke thy counsell light. Po. Art not thou the sister of Cynosbatus, Lord of the silver mines, and golden mountaines. And art not thou as faire a Shepheardesse As trips upon the plaines of Thessaly? Eg. For being great, I am malign'd by Fate, For being faire, I am unfortunate. Po. I know thy sorrowes, sweetest Eglantine; Thy Rhodons absence hath wrought all thy woe, Who now, they say, doth beauteous Iris court. But if thou wilt make me thy instrument, I'll undertake to breake the match, If not, renew the love which earst he bare to thee. Eg. Doe this, and I will live (Poneria) To give thy merit ample satisfaction. I will adore thy skill, and thee adorne With what may make thee famous through all Thessaly. Po. Then banish all these melancholly thoughts, And decke thy selfe in thy most sumptuous weeds. Make hast unto the Fane of gentle Venus, A payre of Turtles of a snowy hue, Upon her altars offer thou to her, And her beseech to intercede for thee Unto her angry boy: Then shalt thou finde The god and goddesse to true lovers kinde. Eg. My deare Poneria, I am truly thine. But tell me, I prethe, what grave S?. is this That lookes like one of Greeces Sages; His reverent Countenance makes me surmise That he's a man of sublime qualities. Po. He is but what he seemes, faire Shepheardesse: His head's the officine of art; his tongue The oracle of truth; he is the man Whom onely Nature hath vouchsaf'd to make Her privy Counsellour. Those abstruse secrets which no mortall eye Did ever view, he plainely can discry; He is the man that's destin'd to find out That grand mysterious secret, in whose discovery So many bold adventrous wits have perished: I meane th' Elixar, the Philosophers precious stone. He is the man who by strange policies Can breake the strong Confederacies of Kings, And overthrow more Empires by his plots, Then mighty Alexander er'e did by strength: Agnostus is his name, renown'd no lesse For honesty, than skill in Sciences. Eg. His silence argues something extraordinary. Ag. Belphegor, Zazel, Astragoth, Golguth, Machon Malortor. Egl. offers to flye away, and is stayed by Po. Eg. Aye me, Poneria. Po. Agnostus, not a word more for thy life. Stay, stay, sweet Eglantine, and dread no harme, This is the language which the Persian Magi us'd When they with their familiars did converse, To which he is so frequently accustom'd, That oft he speakes it e're he be aware. (Agnostus) vouchsafe to use your native language, That Eglantine may know what you are. I hope you know your lesson, Aside. Twice twenty times and ten, &amp;c. Ag. Twice twenty times and ten, hath Titan run Quite through the Zodiacke, since I begun To converse with wise fiends, that I might get The golden key of Natures Cabinet. By industry I got immortall fame, For ignorance begets contempt and shame: So perfect in the Magicke Arts I grew, That natures secrets most abstruse I knew The spirits of ayre and earth did me dread, And did at my venite come with speed; The silly ghosts from graves I did forth call The earth I make to bellow, starres to fall. The world at my great awfull charmes did quake, Nature her selfe for very feare did shake: To change midday to midnight, or to cause Estivall snowes, or breake the vipers jawes, Or to drive rivers backe to their spring heads, And make seas stand unmov'd, or to strike dead The vernall blossome, or the harvest eare: A man would thinke these strange conclusions were, But I account them of small weight: I know The use of hearbes, and whatsoever grow; The cause to the effect I can apply, And worke strange things by hidden sympathies. I doe exactly know the compositions Of unctious Philters, and loves potions: Figures, suspensions and ligations, Characters and suffumigations. For I the vertues of all simples know From whence; effects that seeme impossible I show. The gall of shreeke Owles, &amp; harsh night Ravens tongu[e]s Guts of Panthers, and Chamelions lungs, A blacke Buls eyes, a speckled toads dry'd head, Frankincense, camphire, and white poppie-seed; Poysenous Melanthion, and a white Cocks bloud, Sweet Myrrhe, Bay-berries, precious balsome wood, A Harts marrow that hath devour'd a snake, And scalpes which from a wilde beasts jawes we take, The bone that lyes ith' left side of a Frogge, A stone that is bitten with a mad dogge. The Mandrake root, the blood of a blacke Cat, A Turtles liver, the braines of a Batt, Hyaenas heart, the Cockatrices bloud, That are against so many evils good: The haire of a thiefe that hangs on a tree; The nailes of ships that wracked be, The blood of a wretched man that was slaine, The eyes of a Dragon and Weasels braines. The precious simples, and a thousand more I could produce; I have them all in store: And though they seeme to men meere trifling things, Each one (I vow) ore'weighes ransomes of Kings. The blindnesse of these times cannot discrie The vertues rare that in these simples lye. Po. Enough Agnostus: Now faire Shepherdesse, I hope you have a faire expression Of this learn'd mans sublime desert, and art? Eg. I doe admire his skill, and see (by happe) Good stuffe may be beneath a satten Cap. Exeunt. SCEN. 4. Rhodon, Martagon, Violetta, Acanthus. Rho. Know Martagon, that as no dynasties can stand, No Empires long subsist, unlesse they be Supported by the Columnes of true equity: So shall that government of thine decay, Since thy oppression makes the weake a pray. Mar. Tis no oppression for to punish those, That have transgrest the Lawes, as I suppose. Vio. The lawes (Colossus) proud, unjust tyrant, That dost observe nor equity nor law. But by the torrent of ambition hurry'd, Dost act what lawlesse passion prompts thee to: What Lawes have I transgrest? it is thy might, That into seeming wrong hath chang'd our right: Had Fortune beene as just as was our cause, We that are censur'd now for breach of Lawes, Maugre thy viprous hate, had now bin free, And for thy foule injustice censur'd thee. Mar. And is your pride Virago still so high? That it doth over-top your misery. Cann't sorrow strike thee dumbe, can no disaster, The liberty of thy tongue over-master. Ac. Nay, be assur'd (proud man) not any smart, Can cure the courage of a valiant heart: No force a heart of adamant can breake; And loosers must, and shall have leave to speake: Rho. No more Acanthus: heare me Martagon: Wilt thou give Violetta what's her owne? Will thou restore her right and due possessions? And make a recompence for all oppressions, That happy peace with joy and plenty crown'd, May in the fields of Thessaly be found? Mar. This will I doe, When seas shall be drunke dry by Phoebus beames, And when the lesser starres shall drinke the streames. This will I doe, When of my life and freedome I am weary, Non minor est virtus quam quae rere parta tueri. Ac. Before this guiltlesse woman shall endure Such shamefull injuries: they selfe assure I'le empty all these azure rivulets Of their virmilion streames; and quite discharge This contemn'd bulke of mine, of living ayre; And stretch'd upon the gelid bed of death, Ile to the world this Epitaph bequeath, Here lyes a Swaine that spent his deerest blood, To kill a Tyrant for a Virgins good. Ma. Bold heroe doe thy worst, what I have won I nere will part withall till life be done. Rho. Tenacious Tyrant, in whose flinty heart Nor equity, nor justice ere had part: Assure thy selfe thy guilty soule shall feele Revenges hand, arm'd with a scourge of steele. Exeunt. ACT 3. SCEN. 1 Clematis Solo Well, if I were but once rid of her service, If I ever serv'd love-sicke mistris againe, I would feed all my life time on Agnus Castus, And give all the world leave to let me dye a maid: I even spoyld a good mother wit With beating my head about these knick knacks, Which my mistris, Madam Eglantine, Hath enjoyn'd me to procure her, For now seduc'd by the old bawd Poneria, She thinks to recover her old sweet-heart Rhodon. Here is a Catalogue as tedious as a Taylors bill, Of all the devices which I am commanded to provide, videlicet: Chaines, coronets, pendans, bracelets and eare-rings, Pins, girdles, spangles, embroyderies, rings, Shadows, rebatos, ribbands, ruffes, cuffes and fals: Scarfes, feathers, fans, maskes, muffes, laces and cals; Thin tiffanies, copweb-lawne and fardingals, Sweet-bals, vayles, wimples, glasses, crisping-pins; Pots, oyntments, combs, with poking-sticks &amp; bodkins; Coyfes, gorgets, fringes, rowles, fillets and haire-laces; Silks, damasks, velvet, tinsels, cloth of gold, And tissue, with colours of a hundreth fold. Enter Gladiolus But in her tyres so new fangl'd is she, That which doth with her humour now agree, To morrow she dislikes, now doth she sweare, That a loose body is the neatest weare; But ere an houre be gone, she will protest A strait gowne graces her proportion best: Now cals she for a boistrous fardingall, Then to her hips shele have her garments fall: Now doth she praise a sleeve that's long and wide, Yet by and by that fashion doth deride: Sometimes sh'applauds a pavement-sweeping traine, And presently dispraiseth it againe. Now she commends a shallow band so small, That it may seeme scarce any band at all; But soone to a new fancy doth she reele, And cals for one as big as a coach-wheele: She'le weare a flowry coronet to day, The symboll of her beauties sad decay; To morrow she a waving plume will try, The embleme of all female lenitie, Now in her hat, then in her haire she's drest, For of all fashions she thinks change the best. Gla. Good fellow servant, honest Clematis. Let me conclude thy tedious tale with this; I say the restlesse sea and flitting winde, Are constant in respect of women kinde. Cle. Nor in her weeds alone is she so nice, But rich perfumes she buyes at any price. Storax and Spiknard she burnes in her Chamber, And daubes her selfe with Civit, Muske and Amber. With limbecks, viols, pots, her Closet's fill'd, Full of strange liquors by rare art distill'd: She hath Vermilion and Antimony, Cerusse and sublimated Mercury. Waters she hath to make her face to shine; Confections eke to clarifie her skin; Lipsalves, and cloathes of a pure scarlet dye She hath, which to her cheekes she doth apply: Oyntments wherewith she pargets ore her face, And lustrifies her beauties dying grace. She waters for the Morphewes doth compose, And many other things, as strange as those; Some made of Daffadils, some of lees, Of scarwolfe some, and some of rinds of trees, With Centory, sower Grapes, and Tarragon, She maketh many a strange lotion: Her skin she can both supple and refine, With juyce of Lemons and with Turpintine: The marrow of the Hernshaw and the Deere, She takes likewise to make her skin looke cleere: Sweet waters she distils, which she composes Of flowers of Oranges, Woodbine or Roses: The vertue of Jesmine and three-leav'd grasse, She doth imprison in a brittle glasse, With Civet, Muske, and odours farre more rare, These liquors sweet incorporated are: Lees she can make which turne a haire that's old Or colour'd ill, into a hue of gold. Of horses, beares, cats, camels, conies, snakes, Whales, Herons, bittours, strange oyles she makes, With which dame natures errours she corrects, Using arts helpe to supply all defects. She in the milke of Asses bathes her skin, As did the beautiful Poppea, when She tempted Nero to forsake the bed Of great Octavia, and her selfe to wed. Gla. If there be any Gentlewoman here, That will with gracious acceptation use The service of a tatling Chambermaid, I would advise her to make choice of this Frisketta; That is as chaste as Helen, or Corinthian Lais, As chary of bewraying secrets as was Echo: Oh she would prove a rare Privie Councellour In some great Ladies privie Chamber. The perpetuall motion for which Artists have so labor'd Is discover'd no where so plainly as in her tongue, Which scarce finds any leisure to rest, No not when she is asleepe: But of her curtesie she is so charitable, And so heroically magnificent, That she will both vouchsafe to commiserate The lowe estate of an humble groome of the stable, And also satisfie the desire Of a high and mighty Gentleman-usher In a kisse or any other amorous encounter: Gentlemen beleeve me in few, she is a pearle, Whose worth the age cannot value. If there be any Gentleman here That will bestow a small pension upon her, With a kisse or two once a fortnight, To make her his intelligencer of state In his wives common-wealth; I will undertake he shall be able to make good A faction against his wife, Had she an Amazons stomacke, a Zenobia's, Or a Xanthippes tongue. Cl. Out you pratling Parachito Come you hither to abuse me. Take this for your paines. She strikes him. Gla. Now thank thy stars, that with a female signature Did stampe thy sexe, audacious strumpet, Shall I draw? no, now I think ont I will not; For reason and experience shewes, that no man Ere gain'd repute by drawing gainst a woman. Cl. Stripling, dost thinke I feare a naked blade; Ile meete thee where thou dar'st, and whip thee too For thy unruly tongue, thy sawcinesse. Gla. Well minion, remember this, If I doe not cry you quit for this abuse, Then let me nere be trusted: Your Mistris shall know how you have us'd me, So she shall. Cl. Skippjake tell what you can, I weigh't not this, Ile make you know that you have done amisse. Exeunt. SCEN. 2. Poneria, Eglantine. Po. Forget you not the powder for your breath, Eg. I tooke a dram of it this morning, According to your appointment. Po. Your pallid cheeke requires, in mine opinion, A deeper tincture of vermilion. Eg. And I am of the same minde: But 'twas my Maids fault. I thinke she goes about utterly to undoe me: She is as good a servant as ere was Married to the whipping-post. Po. I tell you true I would not for twenty crownes That Rhodon had seene you with this face. That Ceruse on your brow is extreamely dull, There is no lustre, no resplendency in it. S'light I have seene often times a stain'd cloath Over a smoakie chimmey in an Alehouse Present me with a better face. Eg. Nay, I could not for my heart perswade The wicked pertinacious harlot, To lay more colour on then pleased her fancy; But if I live I will cashiere the queane. Po. If you doe not, you are no friend to your selfe. Eg. How lik'st thou the colour of my haire. Po. O that is exceedingly well dyde. Eg. Me thinks the hue is not high enough. Po. Nay, pardon me Madam: tis passing well. The browne hue is the most incomparable colour For a haire of all other. Those golden wires that on faire Hero's sholders dangl'd, And those faire flaxen threds that made Jove Dote upon faire Nonacrine, May not be compar'd with the lovely browne. Eg. Discreet Poneria, thy wise approbation Doth give my fancy ample satisfaction. But heare me Poneria, will you undertake That I shall meet with the Shepheard Rhodon, As you oft have promis'd me. Po. Faire shepheardesse I will. Eg. But 'tis a thing impossible I feare. Po. Why so good Eglantine? Eg. Because I heare he deeply is ingag'd To Iris, that proud Damsell of Hymettus. Po. I grant he is: and since things are thus, I will so act my part, that his new love Shall be the meanes to renue that good will That hath bin heretofore betwixt him and you. Eg. Nor Circes drugs, nor all Ulysses, wits, I tell thee Beldame, can accomplish this. Po. Good daughter undervalue not my skill, For 'tis contriv'd how it shall be effected, And to satisfie thy curiosity, I will declare how I have laid the plot. Eg. I prethe blesse my eares with this relation. Po. I will a message beare in Iris name, Unto the Shepheard Rhodon, which shall shew, That she desires an am'rous interview With him, in such a privacy That day must not be guilty of it: A solitary glade shall be the place, Where you protected by the veile of conscious night, Instead of Iris shall present your selfe Unto the Shepheard Rhodon, Whom you shall entertaine with sweet discourse, And so comport your selfe, that he shall thinke, You are his dearest Iris. But to assure him yours, I have provided A precious Philter of rare efficacy, Compos'd according to the rudiments of art. This shall you cause him to carouse As water of inestimable worth. Which done, he is your owne; And Iris then shall be forgotten cleane, As one whom he had nere scarce knowne or seene. Eg. Tis bravely plotted sweet Poneria: But what houre wilt thou allot for this designe. Po. Provide your selfe to meet him in the mirtle grove Upon eleven at night. Eg. Very good. Po. Now Ile to Rhodon goe, and him invite, To meet you at the appointed place this night. Eg. Now most auspicious be thy stars and mine, Let all good lucke attend our great designe. Exeunt. SCEN. 3. Martagon, Cynosbatus. Cy. But is the angry swaine (sai'st thou) so hot, Is Rhodon growne so zealous in his sisters cause? Ma. If that his actions with his words agree, I must expect a sodaine storme. Cy. I am resolv'd to take part in thy fortunes, Be they the worst that ere to any fell. Ma. Thanks noble friend, then here lets joyne our hand[s] In signe of most unseparable bands. Cy. But there's Acanthus a jolly swaine, He frets (they say) like a furious Mirmidon. Ma. In braving language he exceeded so, That Martagon nere saw so bold a foe, Surcharg'd with swelling passion, he did vowe To take a full revenge on me and you. Cy. And is the youth so fill'd with valrous heate? Who would have thought the frozen mountaines could Have bred so brave a hot-spurre. Ma. These raging Lyons must, Cynosbatus, Be undermin'd by some egregious sleight; We must pitch some strong toile for these fierce Beasts, Where we may take them captive at our pleasure: For if we should assaile them openly, Much perill then we might incurre thereby. Cy. What thy high judgement shall conclude to doe, I am resolv'd to condiscend unto. Ma. Then heare what I propound. Cynosbatus, Within a place nigh hand, resides A Beldam much renown'd for sacred skill In magicke mysteries. She with her awfull Charmes wonts to call forth All sorts of noysome Creatures that are bred In Sandy Lybia, or cold Scythia, From whome she takes her choyce of poyson strong. The Herbs which grow on precipitious Erix, She with her bloudy Sicle crops: And whatsoever poysonous weed springs on The craggy top of snowy Caucasus, That's sprinkled with the bloud of wise Prometheus, She carefully selects; Those venomes which the warlike Medians, and The nimble Parthians, or Arabians rich, Use to annoynt their deadly shafts withall. She doth by Moone-light gather; Each Herbe that in this fertle vernall season Puts forth its head from Opses pregnant bosome She searches for; whether the same be bred In the cold Forrest of Hercynea, Or in the deserts of parch'd Africae, What flower soe're doth in his seed or root Strange causes of great mischiefe nourish, She never faileth to finde out: Whether the same on bankes of Tigris growes, Or on the sun-burnt brinke of warme Hydaspes, Whose golden channels pav'd with precious stones; Some of these herbes she doth by twilight gather, At midnight some, and some at breake of day. Nor is she ignorant how to apply The panting heart of the dull melancholy Owle, Or the breathing entrailes cut from a living Cat. The proudest Swaine that lives in Thessaly. Is glad to be obsequious to her will, For in her power it is to cure or kill. Unto this reverent Sybill let us goe, And her advice request in this designe; By her instructions let us our actions regulate; Providing for our owne security: She can divine of all events, and tell Whether things shall succeed or ill or well. Cy. What thy sound judgement thinks fit to be done, I condescend to, noble Martagon. [Exeunt.] SCEN. 4. Rhodon, Anthophotus, Acanthus. Rho. Since that the proud usurper Martagon Will not restore what he hath tane away By force and injury from Violetta, We are resolv'd to put on lawfull armes, To swage the pride of that great Termagant; That of his prowesse doth so vainly vaunt. Therefore deere friends addresse your selves to shew Your true and faithfull fortitudes, for know An ignominious peace may not compare, With any just and honourable warre. An. Out upon this Fabian valour, These tedious cunctations: I tell thee Rhodon, I must needs chide thee for our losse of time. My troopes are all in perfect readinesse, And long to meet their foes in open field; If we deliberate a day longer The edge of their valour (I feare) will be quite taken off. Rho. Now fie upon that valour which depends On circumstance of time or place, Tis relative vertue, that like glasse is brittle, Whose force soone dyes and perfects very little. Ac. Now recollect thy spirits Rhodon, Let Spartan resolution spread it selfe Into each angle of thy noble heart. For now our hostile forces are assembled, Covering the fields from Ossa to Olympus. Their painted banners with the windes are playing: Their pamper'd coursers thunder on the plaines: The splendor of their glistring armes repels The bashfull sun-beames backe unto the clouds. Their bellowing drums and trumpets shrill, Doe many sad corrantos sound, Which danger grim and sprawling death must dance. Now therefore Rhodon, doe reflect thy eye Upon the glories of thy ancestours, And strive by emulation to transcend Those trophies which were yet nere paralleld. An. Surcease this needlesse talke, let us to action, The losse of time consisteth in protraction. Rho. Your noble courages, endeared friends, A good event to our designes portends. Exeunt. SCEN. 5.

Within the precincts of this grove Poneria dwels, Here nightly she hath co[n] venticles With her wise spirits; see how the trees are carv'd With Magicall mysterious characters, See how the fiery fiends with their frequent resort have Scorch'd the leaves, and chang'd the Merry livery of the spring into a mournfull hue. Behold the grasse dyde with the swarthy gore Of some great sacrifice, that late was offer'd up To the infernall powers. Cy. The blacke aspect of this strange uncouth place Doth make my heart to quake. Ma. Within a vault hewne from the stony bowels, Of yon high precipicious rocke she dwels.

Curst was the wight that did in murther first Embrue his guilty hands: curst was that hand Which first was taught by damned hellish art To forge the killing blade in Vulcans flames: What raging fury raignes in mortall brests, That man should man pursue with deadly hate; Oh what malignant power hath defac'd, That spacious image of the gods above? Who hath inspir'd man with that bestiall quality Of murderous revenge? The Lybian Lyons seldome are at oddes, The Tygers of Hyrcania doe agree, But man to man's become a very divell: That Thracian god which is delighted most With humane sacrifices, is now ador'd; Blood-thirsty Mars now beares the onely sway, Who direfull devastations doth affect, Peace hath forsooke the earth, and fell debate Shaking his batter'd armes, now stalketh every where. I hop'd for nuptials sweet, of late, but now I may have cause to feare a funerall. Hymen affrighted with the confus'd noyse Of brutish warre, is fled I know not whither. My dearest Rhodon must depart from me, And in the field ingage his tender Corps To all extremities of death, of wounds, of danger, Of sicknesse and unrest: Vi. Strike not the ayre with this vaine language, Iris, Wound not thy soule with these unseemely plaints, But be content to wait the will of Jove, Who will crowne our designes with blest successe. For in a cause that's honest, just, and right, The gods themselves will take up armes and fight. Ir. Then oh ye powers, that are the grand protectors Of Hyblas happinesse and welfare; Whether ye doe delight in our flower-crown'd mountaines, Our od'rous vales, or in our Christall fountains, Your gracious favour I implore, beseeching you To gard the person of my dearest Rhodon; Fond woman, how forgetfull have I bin? Here is a gemme whose price doth farre transcend All estimation: my faithfull Panace Deliver't thou unto my gentle Shepheard, And pray him weare it for my sake. Pa. Madam, I will. Ir. It from the bowels of a Cocke was tane, And whoso weares the same (as wise men say) Shall ever be victorious in warre. Vio. Commend me to my brother, gentle nymph, And beare this token of my love to him: It is the precious herbe call'd Latice, Which whosoever weares shall never want Sufficient sustenance both for himselfe and his; Besides, it frustrates quite the divellish force Of strongest poysons or enchantments. Exit Pan. Now Iris, let us haste to Floras fane, With our devotions let's importune her. These horrid sturs and troublous broiles to cease, That we againe may live in happy peace. Exeunt. SCEN. 2. Martagon, Cynosbatus, Poneria. Ma. Divinest Matron; god-inspired Sybill Doe this, and be what thou canst desire. Po. Doubt not great Martagon but I will effect it. Ma. Now deere Cynosbatus let us prepare To resist th' impression of our foes: Since that our powerfull forces ready stand, To be obedient to our great command. Cy. With thee I am resolv'd to spend my breath, Indifferent in the choice of life or death. Exeunt Ma. Cy. Po. Agnostus come forth: blacke cloud of ignorance, Advance thy leaden pate, dull Camell. Ag. I cannot brooke this thin and piercing ayre. Po. Thou sonne of sleepe; that hat'st the lightsome day, Clap on thy spectacles of judgement, and behold How I have plaid my part. Thou flow'st with gall (Agnostus) I confesse, But thou hast a braine intolerably dry, As empty of wit, as the world is of conscience. Ag. What hast pluck'd up the flowers by the roots, Or is all Thessaly in a combustion? Po. Surcharg'd with deepe despite and viprous hate, Their forces they against each other bend. Ag. Then I hope their painted pride shal quickly be abated. Po. But I have a plot, old plumbeous dotard, To crop the proudest flower that growes In Hybla or Hymettus. Ag. Poneria, I adore thy art and wisedome. Po. This glasse containes a rare confection: Tis vipers bloud mix'd with the juyce of Aconite: This is the Philter, the sweet love-potion Which Eglantine poore love-sick foole, Must commend to the Shepheard Rhodon, Who this night by my appointment, Is to meet her in the mirtle grove, under the Name of Iris: now Ile to Eglantine, And blesse her longing eares with these glad tidings. Ag. Oh great profound Poneria: never yet Was any that could parallell thy wit. Exeunt. SCEN. 3. Rhodon, Acanthus. Rho. What houre of night is't friend Acanthus? Ac. Th' eleventh at least: for see Orion hath Advanced very high his starry locks in our horizon. Rho. Me thinks the stars looke very ruddy, As if they did portend tempestuous weather. Ac. They doe but blush to see what crimes are acted By mortall under covert of the night. Rho. Saw'st thou yon star that Northward fell. Ac. I saw the blazing meteor stoupe, And bend his course toward the humble Center. Rho. This seem'd a glorious, and resplendent star, Yet was it but a grosse ill temperd meteor. This meteor seem'd as if it had bin fix'd In an orbe for a perpetuity, Yet in a moment it is fallen, thou seest, And who regards this foolish and ignoble fire, Or lookes upon the place from whence it fell. Ac. He that by honourable meanes is rais'd, And hath his seat establish'd on the square Of never sliding vertue, cannot fall. Rho. But if young Phaeton shall undertake To guide the Charret of the great Apollo, And in that action shall miscarry, so That the whole universe shall be ingag'd To utter ruine and destruction, Then ought great Jove to have a speciall care For to preserve and keepe the common good. And if he shall dismount the Chariotter, And with a deadly blow lay him along, The world then for his justice shall thanke Jove, And Phaetons foole-hardiness reprove. Ac. Who dares contest with Jove, or question what His Soveraigne highnesse shall doe or determine. Enter Egl. Poneria. Rho. Tis altogether wicked &amp; unjust: (Acanthus) retire. For now me thinkes I see a glimpse of Iris, Who promised to meet me here this night. Exit Ac. Loe how the lustre of her beauty penetrates The envyous clouds of these nocturnall shades. Po. See yonder the beguiled lover walkes In vaine, expecting the comming of his deare Iris, Now, Eglantine remember my instructions, Have a care that your tongue betray you not. Be not too talkative in any case. Forget not the posture I so oft told you of, Under pretence that these cold nightly dewes are Offensive, you may knit your veile more close, And conceale your feature. Eg. Poneria, retire: I will addresse my selfe unto him. Po. But be sure you perswade him to take the Potion before he sleepes; You'll remember those vertues which I told you it containes. Forget not to declare them amply. Eg. Make no doubt on't: thou hast arm'd me For all assaies. Exit. Pon. Rho. Thou brightest star that shin'st this night, Auspitious be thy influence to thy Rhodon. My dearest Iris, I am surcharg'd with joy To meet thee here. Eg. (Deare Rhodon) who, like the vernall Sunne, Dost lend refreshing heats to my affections. Tak't not amisse, that I have chose this houre And unfrequented place t'enjoy thy company. Rho. Sweet Iris know that I esteeme this houre of night, Since I enjoy thy sweet society, 'Bove all the dayes that I e're hitherto beheld. Eg. But from a maidens modesty (faire Sir) It may seeme much to derogate, To be abroad so late at night. Rho. Since no immodest act is here intended, The time cannot be prejudiciall To thy unstained modesty. Eg. Great pitty tis indeed, Sir, that true love Should be disparag'd, because 'tis so true. Rho. I tell thee, I till now was never happy: All those delights which I ere saw before, Were but meere transitory dreames, Compar'd with that felicity which now I finde. Eg. The sodaine newes of this late kindled warre, Wherein I heare (to my great griefe) you are ingag'd, Made me transgresse the bounds of modesty so farre, That I desir'd once more to see your face, Ere your departure to the field of danger. Rho. Since my good fortune and thy constant love Have joy'd me once againe with thy sweet presence, I blesse my lot, and to the field will hasten, As ready to out-face danger, as scorne death; And if I there finde fortunate successe, Of all my good Ile count thee patronesse. Eg. And here on you I doe bestow this viall, Which such a precious dosis doth containe, That it doth farre exceed the height of value. It is a potion made by wondrous art, Nectar is no more comparable to it, Than Bonniclabar is to Husquobath; And Aurum potabile is as far short of it, As poore Metheglin is of rich Canary: All the confections even from the lowest degree Of Sage-ale, to the height of Aqua-Celestis, Are no more like it then the beere of the Low-countries Is to the High-country wine: A dram of it taken before you goe to bed Cheeres the heart, prevents the Incubus And all frightfull dreames; cheeres the blood, Comforts the stomacke, dispels all collickes, Cures all aches, repayres the liver, helpes The lungs, rectifies the braine, quencheth All the senses, strengthens the memory, refresheth The spirits. Taken fasting it breaks the stone in bladder Or kidnyes, cures the gout, expels a quartane ague: Outwardly apply'd it kils the gangrene, And destroyes the wolfe, heales all sorts of wounds, Bruses, boyles, and sores. And not to use more multiplicity of words, I tell you gentle Rhodon you shall finde, It cures all griefes of body and of minde. Rho. (Faire one) verball expression cannot shew What I to thee for this great gift doe owe: But till for all I full requitall make, My constant love thou for a pledge shalt take. Eg. But (gentle Sir) although your constitution So well attemper'd seemes, that no disease Can either hurt or over-throw your health, Yet if my counsell might prevaile with you, I should perswade you to make tryall of this Rare water this night before you sleepe. Rho. Since thou vouchsaf'st to be my kinde Physician, For this time I will act a patients part, And ere that sleepe shall with his leaden keyes Locke up the portals of my drowsie eyes, Ile taste of this most precious liquor: But lest the gealed moisture of the night Should prejudice thy health, (sweet Iris) Let me conduct thee homeward. Eg. Since these nocturnall distillations May be offensive to your health (sweet Rhodon) I will be well contented to be gone, Though wondrous loth from you to part so soone. Rho. But in my absence be assur'd of this, That Rhodons heart in thy possession is. Exeunt. SCEN. 4 Panace Sola. Upon this shady banke with laurels crown'd, The gentle Shepheard Rhodon dwels: His Cottage seated is upon a Cristall River, The sweetest streame that e're in valley crept. Two pretious presents I to him must beare: The one from his true love, the beaut'ous Iris, And that's a gemme of admirable vertue; The bounty of the Easterne mines could ne're bestow A Jewell of such worth as this, Which from the entrailes of a Cocke was ripp'd; For whosoever shall possesse the same, Shall be invincible in fight. But his deare Sister, lovely Violetta, Commends to him this admirable plant, The noblest herbe that e're in garden grew. For, setting many pretious properties aside, It is the best and strongest antidote That Art or Nature ever made. No deadly poyson can withstand its power, But is expulst by it with great facility. These noble gifts beseeming well, Both the receivers and the givers qualities, I will deliver to the honour'd Swaine. Exit. SCEN. 5. Martagon, Cynosbatus, Poneria. Ma. Sage Dame, how fares thy grand designe? Dost thinke thy plot will take? Po. Nay, if you doubt it, I wish it nere might take. Have I made hell a partie in the action, And laid such snares, that more then humane force Cannot withstand my well knit stratagem; Yet will you still torment me with these doubts? Ma. Nay gentle mother, be not so impatient. Po. You tempt my patience, while you thus mistrust My skill and my ability. Cy. We doe adore thy matchlesse skill and wisdome, Thou grace and wonder of thy sexe. Po. Me thinkes I see the merry Post at hand, That brings us joyfull newes of Rhodons death: And not behinde him much me thinkes I see Another Post, who comes with better newes, That Rhodons army is discourag'd and discarded, Yea quite disbanded and disperst. Ma. Oh happy newes (divine Poneria) Po. Yet ye account me a meere silly Dame, Yea as silly as some simple simpering Citizen. That hath but manners enough to take The upper end of a Table at a feast, And to carve a Capons legge to a Coxcombe. Ma. The ten Sybils were no more comparable to thee, Than an old Gentlewoman is to a yong Chambermaid. Sweet Poneria, I am even in love with thee: Yea, I durst almost sweare I should kisse thee, If thou had'st but three rotten teeth in thy head. Po. Well, my Masters, I hope you'll thanke me When you heare that I have made proud Rhodon A Legier Embassadour in Don Pluto's Court. Ma. Thy thankes, Poneria, shall be duly paid In eyebewitching talents; Wee'll rip the matrice of our grandam earth To see the place where riches are conceiv'd; And from her pregnant wombe we'll draw A golden age for thee to live in (Deare Poneria) Po. Who would leave any villany undone, To be thy slave, most noble Martagon. Exit Pone. Cy. Now Martagon let us goe put on armes, And toward Hybla march in strong aray. Let us deface the glory of their flowers, If Rhodon be but dead, the day is ours. [Exeunt.] ACT. 5 SCEN. 1 Acanthus, Anthophotus. An. Thou speak'st of things beyond beleefe, Acanthus. Ac. Too true it is, I shrewdly feare, For every circumstance makes it appeare That Rhodon in the mirtle grove, last night, Had private conference with Iris, From whom (it seemes) he tooke the venom'd potion, For now he doth, in his extremest fits, Exclaime on the untruth of woman kind, Bewailing the unlucky houre that did present Your sister Iris to his sight. Enter Pan. Pa. Anthophotus and Acanthus, y'are well met. Ac. Nay, never worse, thou wouldst say, gentle Panace, If thou knew'st all. Pa. What dire disastre hath befalne you, honor'd friends? How fares the noble Shepheard Rhodon? Ac. Rhodon's mishap's the cause of all our sorrow: Rhodon's betray'd, poyson'd, and lies at point of death. Pa. Curs'd be the hand that did attempt A villany so impious and foule. But if you love your selves, and Rhodons health, Conduct me to him immediately: I have an antidote that shall cure him, If any breath be left within his bulke. An. Oh happy comfort! come sweet Panace, To our sicke friend, we'll thy Conductors be. Exeunt. SCEN. 2. Martagon, Cynosbatus. Cy. A happy morne be this to thee (friend Mortagon), Ma. Nay, 'tis the happiest morn that e'r we two beheld, Rhodon is dead; And is by this time, serv'd up in a wooden dish, To feast the wormes upon an earthen table; The purple bosom'd rose whose glorious pride Disdain'd the beauties of all other flowers, is cropt, Yea the ambitious bramble is quite wither'd, And now is laid in the contemned dust: Ponerias wit hath done this noble act. Cy. This is good newes, I must confesse, yet could I wish That noble Rhodon had not so ignobly dy'd. Ma. Thou art too ceremonious for a politician, And too superstitious: our duties 'tis to judge Of the effect as it concernes the state of our affaires, And not to looke backe on the meanes by which 'twas wrought. He is unfit to rule a Civill state That knowes not how in some respects to favour Murther, or treason, or any other sinne Which that subtill animall, call'd man, Doth openly protest against, for this end, That he may more freely act it in private, As his occasions shall invite him to't. But 'tis no disputing now; the deed is done, We are in a faire way to victory, Conquest, triumph, and renowne; We have a faire b[e]ginning, and what's well begun, (If that the proverbe speakes truth) is halfe done. Exeunt. SCEN. 3. Poneria, Agnostus. Po. Now Agnostus, since by the death of Rhodon We have endear'd our selves to Martagon, 'Tis meet we provide for a backe winter, That we purchase some eminence of place, To make us glorious in the worlds ill-sighted eye, That being great we may the greater mischiefe doe: And since a war is newly set abroach, I will a suter be to Generall Martagon, To place thee in some military office Of high regard and speciall consequence, Where by thy ignorant conduct and base carriage, Thou mai'st a thousand heroicke soules send packing Unto the Stygian shore. Ag. Nay good Poneria, I finde my selfe unfitting for the warres. Po. What neither hart nor braines; out inglorious lozel, Thou most unweldy burthen of the earth: I could finde in my heart to kicke thy soule out Of thy carkasse: art all compos'd of earth and water? Hast not a sparke of ayre or fire in that bulke? Ag. Nay sweet Poneria, I am thy slave. Po. I tell thee I will procure thee a Captaines place. Ag. But I am altogether ignorant in the words of command, And know not one posture neither of Musket or Pike. Po. Hast wit enough to swallow the dead payes, And to patch up thy Company in a Mustring day: Hast valour enough to weare a Buffe-jerken With three gold laces. Hast strength enough to support a Dutch felt With a flaunting Feather? Can thy side endure to be wedded to a Rapire Hatch'd with gold, with hilt and hangers of the new fashion? Canst drinke, drab, and dice: Canst damne thy selfe into debt among Beleeving Tradesmen; Hast manners enough to give thy Lieuetenant, Antient or Sergeant leave to goe before thee Upon any peece of danger? Hast wit enough, in thy anger, not to draw a sword? These are the chiefe properties that pertaine To our moderne Captaines; and if thou Could'st but be taught these military rudiments, I doubt not but thou mightst prove a very Excellent new souldier. Ag. If this be all, I hope, in time, to be as famous As e're was Caesar, or great Pompey. Po. Agnostus, come along, thy selfe prepare To be a servant to the god of warre. Exeunt. SCEN. 4. Rhodon, Acanthus, Anthophotus, Panace. Rho. This strange imposture hath amaz'd me so, That I am almost to a statue strucke, Not knowing what to speake, or what to thinke. Pa. Assure your selfe it was a strange Collusion: For this, on my fidelity, beleeve, That 'twas not Iris whom you met last night. Rho. Then 'twas some hellish hag, that, in her shape, Gave me the venemous confection Which had undone me quite, if thou in time Had'st not apply'd thy precious antidote. But yet, me thinkes, that heaven should not permit The subt'lest hellish power to counterfeit The feature of so beautifull an angell. Ac. Doubtlesse it was the false Ponerias plot, Whom Martagon hath lately entertaind, With her companion, old Agnostus; For, know the malice of your foes is such, That if by open force they can't destroy you, By hidden plots they'll seeke your overthrow. Rho. Then I must pardon crave of gentle Iris, To whom I did ascribe this treacherous fact. An. If she were guilty of so blacke a deed These hands should chaine her to a fatall stake, And sacrifice her Corps in hideous flames, Unto the awfull goddesse of revenge; (Which done) I'de throw her hatefull ashes up Against the furious gusts of boistrous winds, That being so disperst, there might remaine Not the least relique of so vile a wretch. Rho. My Iris is as cleare as innocency it selfe; And since my treacherous foes have gone about, By wicked flights, to wrong so sweet a saint, And bring me also to a shamefull end, I here enjoyne ye (honourable friends) Upon my sword to take a solemne oath, He drawes his sword, they lay their hands upon it, and kisse it. Ne're to lay downe your just and lawfull armes, Untill we be avenged to the full, For such unkindly and disloyall wrongs: True honour, that with dearest bloud is sought, Is like a precious gemme that's cheaply bought. An. Ill is a life bestow'd upon that wight That dares not loose it to maintaine the right: Him I account a base inglorious sot, That dares not honor pull from dangers throat. Exeunt. SCEN. 5. Martagon, Cynosbatus, Agnostus, Poneria. Ma. Lady Poneria, upon your commendation, We bestow a regiment upon this Gentleman. Po. Thanks (worthy Martagon) beleeve it Sir, Those good respects which I to your affaires owe, Urg'd me t'importune you for his employment, Because I know him to be a tri'd souldier, Of great experience, worth and merit: How say you, Colonell Agnostus, I hope your actions shall make good my words hereafter. Ag. I am at your service, Madam Poneria: I am a man of action, I confesse. Po. Trust me sir, although he wants verball expression, He is a Gentleman of singular abilities. Ma. And I thinke no lesse, for th' are not good words That makes deserving souldiers, but good swords. Cy. He lookes as if he had bin bred, borne, And brought up in a Leager all his life time. Enter Gladiolus. Glad. Noble Generall; the beaut'ous Eglantine Wisheth all happinesse to your designes, Desiring that this paper may kisse your hands for her. He opens the Letter. Ma. Tis about a place, Ile pawne my life on't: Heare me Mounsier, I understand the businesse: Her request is granted. She when she please, may at my hands command A greater curtesie then this. Gla. Thanks honor'd Sir. Ma. On you I bestow a Captaines place. Gla. Now I perceive that the readi'st way to attaine Preferment in the Court of Mars, Is to creep into the favour of Venus. Ma. I understand you are a man of reall worth, And very sufficient for such an office. Enter Acanthus. Ac. Imperious Martagon, that art no lesse Knowne for thy power, then thy wickednesse: In Rhodons name I doe defie thee here, Who chalengeth the Combat at thy hands, To be aveng'd on thee for thy foule wrongs: But if thou dar'st not in a single fight, Give satisfaction to the noble Shepheard; Then thee and all thy troopes he doth invite, To a bloudy breakfast to morrow morne. Attended by a vigorous army he Stands in the confines of his owne dominions Swearing that he will prove it in the field, That thou a tyrant and a traitour art. Ma. Bold friend, I prethe speake ingeniously, Doth this defiance come from Rhodons mouth. Ac. Upon my life, &amp; by the honor of a souldier it doth. Ma. Then tell him, I'me resolv'd to be a guest, More bold then welcome at his bloudy feast. Ac. I will great Martagon; and misdoubt not, But that your cheere shall be exceeding hot. Exit Aca. Ma. Dissembling witch: how hast thou beguil'd us? Po. What adverse power hath crost our plot? Ma. Did'st not thou with thy deep protestatio[n]s force us To give strong credence to thy false relations, When thou affirm'dst that thou hadst poyson'd Rhodon. Po. The opposition of the cursed fates Hath brought us to deserv'd confusion. Ma. Avant you hagge, abhominable sorceresse, Here I doe thee on paine of death enjoyne, With that Impostor thy companion, Immediately to depart out of my Dominions. Po. Now I accursed wretch have seene too well, That heaven will not be overrul'd by hell. Ag. How sodainly by one contrarious gust, Is all our honour tumbled into dust. Ma. Since that our braving foe is now at hand, (Cynosbatus) we must not thinke of a retreat. Cy. What your discretion holds fit to be done, I condiscend to noble Martagon. Ma. Then let us meet our proud foe face to face, And with our swords and speares that right maintaine, Which lately we by sword and speare did gaine. Exeunt. SCEN. 6. Rhodon, Anthophotus, Acanthus. Rho. Deserving friends and fellow souldiers, Now arme your selves with Romane fortitude: First call to minde the justice of our cause, And then let each remember that true honour, Which must be valu'd above health and life: Consider also that we must contend, Against a tyrant and a meere usurper; A person guilty of no meane offences, Which must be justly punish'd by our swords. Enter Poneria, Agnostus. Po. Thrice noble Rhodon, in whose noble brest True pitty dwels, vouchsafe a pardon To us distressed Caitives. Rho. I neither know what your offences are, nor yet your selves. Po. I am the unfortunate Poneria, That was suborn'd by unjust Martagon To worke thy utter ruine: I did conduct the love-sicke Eglantine Unto thy presence instead of Iris: I caus'd her to give thee a poysonous drinke, Under the pretence that it was a love-potion. I have deserv'd to dye, and crave life at your hands. Rho. And are you the grand incendiary That have so many mischiefes wrought in Thessaly? Now I remember I have seen your elvish countenance, Nor have I altogether forgot your reverent mate, Who with his personated gravity deludes the world, Being accounted a man of profound art. Acanthus, see them committed to safe custody, See you make them sure for starting. Po. Nay worthy sir. Ac. You must away, for no entreaties can prevaile. Exeunt Po. Ag. Ac. Rho. The apprehension of these wretches doth presage Auspicious fortunes to our actions; Drum beats a march within. List, list, Anthophotus, our enemies are at hand, Their thundring drums warne us of their approach. [An.] Wee'le bid them noble welcome then: this day will I Victorious be (I vow) or bravely dye. Rho. Thy honour'd resolution I commend, And take it for a signe of good successe. Enter Acan. Ac. Arme, arme: the hostile forces are in sight, And thus come marching on in proud array: The Battaile's led by Martagon himselfe, Wherein are marshal'd neere five thousand Bill men, All clad in coats of red: A furious Amazon cald Tulipa, Brings on three thousand burley Swissers, Arai'd in gorgeous Coats of red and yellow; And these make up the vanne: To which are added for a forlorne hope, Two hundred melancholy Gentlemen, The fierce Cynosbatus brings up the Rere, Wherein about two thousand souldiers be Clad all in greene, and arm'd with pikes of steele. Narcissus with a thousand Daffadils, Clad in deepe yellow coats doth flanke The right side of the battaile. The left wing is by Hyacinthus led, Wherein a thousand Souldiers march, Arraid in purple coats. Enter Martagon, Rhodon. Ma. What fury tempted thee unhappy Rhodon, In hostile manner thus to invade my confines. Rho. For Violettas sake I tooke up armes, Whom thou unjustly hast opprest. Musicke sound. Ma. What I have done my sword shall justifie. Rho. Whence comes this most harmonious melody. Enter Flora, Iris, Eglantine, Panace. Flo. Put up these murdring blades on paine of my displeasure, Confine them to perpetuall prison in the scabbard, That they may nere come forth to manage civill broiles. All. We must obey, and will, Oh awfull goddesse. Flo. While in my flowry bowers I tooke repose, I heard the noyse of these tumultuous broiles, Which strooke me with a wonderfull amazement. Then hastily I left my bankes of pleasure, And hither came to end these mortall jarres; Therefore I charge you both on that allegance And respect which you doe owe to me, Quite to dismisse your armed bands. And you Martagon, who have faire Violetta wrong'd, To her shall make an ample restitution, Of what y'have tane from her; And entertaine a friendly league with Rhodon, Which you Cynosbatus must also condescend to: But as for you fond Madam Eglantine, Since you have broke the sacred lawes of love, And by unlawfull meanes sought to accomplish Your designes, and make the Shepheard Rhodon Enamor'd on you: You to a vestall Temple shall be confin'd, Where with ten yeeres pennance You shall expiate your folly. But where be those two intruders Poneria and Agnostus. These that have crept in among us, and with false flights Sought to ore-throw our state. Poneria and Agnostus brought. We banish them quite Out of Thessaly for ever. What I have decreed you must assent unto. Ma. We doe, because we must. Flo. Rhodon, I here bestow on thee this noble shepherdesse. Rho. Thanks for your precious gift, renowned Queen. Flo. And now since all things are reduc'd to joyfull peace, Let us betake our selves to sweet delights, And solemnize with mirth your nuptiall rites. Epilogue. Since Ignorance and Envie now are banish'd; Since discord from among the flowers is vanish'd; Since Rhodon is espous'd to Iris bright; Since warre hath happy Thessaly left quite, Let every one that loves his Countries peace, His height of gladnesse with his hands expresse. FINIS. FUNERALL ELEGIES; Consecrated to the immortal memory, of the Right Honorable the Lady Katherine Paston, late wife to the truely noble, and heroicke, William Paston of Oxned Esquire Vivit post funera virtus. To the no lesse honoured, for vertuous habits, and naturall endowments, than high birth, the Lady Elizabeth Bertue, Daughter to the right Noble, and most accomplished Lord, ROBERT Earle of Lindsey, &amp;c. Eleg. 1. And must our brows with Cypresse sad be bound? Because Calista is with glory crownd, Immortall splendent bayes, that grow upon Mount Sion high, not earthly Helicon. In sable darke must we our bodies dight? Because our Saint is clad in robes of white. Shall we on earth sob forth our Elegyes? While she sings Allelujah in the skyes: Our sorrowes are prepost'rous, and we erre In offering patheticke songs to her, Whose vertues rare require a Lyrists quill, Or rather Panegyrists learned skill. Homer, and Virgill caroling her praise, (Had they liv'd now) might well have wonne the bayes, Although the Iliads, and the Æneids both, Had nere been borne: these works were built on froth: For 'tis a question, not resolved yet, When Ilium was sack'd, or whether it, Was ruin'd by the Greekes at all; and why Should Virgill censur'd be for flattery? 'Cause he deriv'd the great Cesarian name, From Varlets, that surviv'd their Cities flame, From one that left his friends, and wife engag'd, When bloody Mars, and fiery Vulcan ragd: Doubtlesse a pious Knight, and debonaire, Who brought his wronged Mistris to despaire, Then fled from her, whom basely he deceiv'd, Though nobly shee had him, and his reliev'd. True Vertue is my subject, and that such, As seldome did ere Woman owne so much. Honours great example, beauties bright throne, The Temple of sincere religion, An altar of unfaigned piety. The Golden branch of true nobility, The Palace of the Graces, and the spheare, Wherein no cloud, nor meteour did appeare, The Pyramid of love, Truths pretious shrine, The helpe, and hope of all the sacred nine, The Treasury of thoughts pure, and sublime, The Phoebe, and the Phoenix of her time; All these was shee: yea more then these was shee: But what shee was, cleare Angels onely see; For tongue, or penne of Man, cannot expresse Such bright unlimited existences. Shee was: shee is declind: she being gone, The World that had two Sunnes, hath now but one; And we envelop'd in a night of sorrow, In darkenesse mourne, despairing of a morrow; For who can be so rich of hope, t'expect That Nature can her Parallel erect, Since shee on her expended hath such store Of Gifts, that shees become a bankrupt poore? As when some wealthy Tradesman doth demise, The summe of all his richest merchandise, In a faire vessell to the fickle seas, Hoping to reape a plentifull encrease, By this adventure; but the Winds conspire With froward Neptune, to crosse his desire, And ruine all his hopes, for in one houre The greedy Ocean doth his goods devoure: So our rich Argosie (which fraighted was, Not with Tobacco, Indico, nor glasse, But with pearles, gemmes, gold, amber, spiceries, Arabian gummes, and what the treasuries Of the two Indies could afford) is lost, Her faire carine's wrack'd on the shelvy coast Of fraile mortality: The Grave hath wonne Natures chief jewell, and the World's undone: The golden chaine of causes is dissolv'd, And Chaos (that so long hath beene involv'd In the unseene abysse) attempts to rise, And make both Orbes, and Elements his prize. The Worlds soule's fled; the exit of her breath, Threatens (I feare) an universall death; For in her fate all vertues did decline, All beauties were eclipst, and ceast to shine: But if true honour shall her end survive, If reall worth shall in her absence thrive, Posterity shall her example praise, For such great benefits, numbring those dayes, Which shee spent here on earth, with pebbles white: Princes shall trophyes reare, and Poets write, Striving to make her name last with her blisse, And raise her fame as high as now shee is. As the Pantarba, brightest of all gemmes, Dost darkest nights enlighten with her beames, And by a hidden sympathy, attract Adjacent stones, in heapes together packt; But Nature, least a jewell so renown'd, Should lose esteeme, by being often found, Hath in the bowels of the center, hid This pretious secret, and decreede beside, That being found it soone againe is lost, If not preserv'd, with wondrous care, and cost: So our bright Goddesse, (whose resplendent worth That in this night of vice, did rayes send forth Of sanctity divine, drawing all hearts, To honour, and adore, so high deserts) Was soone snatch'd hence, yet not through our neglect, Or want of due obsequious respect; But rather 'cause Heaven thought the world unfit, For such a gemme to be a Cabinet. The Corall growing in the Ocean blew, Wants hardnesse, and retaines a pallid hue: There churlish billowes oft the same doe daunt; But when aire breathes upon this wat'ry plant, It instantly becomes a crimson stone, And many pretious properties puts on; The Artist then it with pure mettall deckes, For Infant Kings, to weare about their neckes. So pious soules, that in the Ocean wide, Of this tumult'ous universe abide, No firme existence, nor faire lustre have, Tost to and fro by every adverse wave, Of sorrowfull disasters, but when Time Hath them advanc'd above the starres sublime, Then consorts they become of Angels bright, Adorn'd with golden crownes, and vestures white. Thus change of native soyle brings Soules to blisse A Wiseman much by travell betterd is. But ye faire eyes, like diamonds richly set, Apostrophe to La. E. B. On a white, rosie, circuled carkanet, That late sweld up the streames of cristall The name of the river running at the foote of Oxned. Bure, With your more cristall teares, and rills more pure, Forbeare to droppe those pearles, lest your sad mone, Transforme your selves to starres, and us to stone: (Thrice honoured Lady) you that lately were The sweet associate, of your Sister deare, When ye like those auspicious lights did shine, Which happy calmes to Mariners presigne. Like Turtles chast, or silver-brested Swannes Stroking the thinne ayre with their snowy fannes, Ye late appear'd: but cruell Death (God wot) With ruthlesse blade, hath cut the Gordian knot Of your society, Death onely could divide, Such blessed bonds, a league so strongly ty'd. Nor can expence of sorrowes finde redresse, For this sad accident, or make it lesse: Griefes are no cures for ill's, and do arise From humane weaknesse, not from reason wise. When great Darius, of his consort deare Deprived was, by Atropos severe, To griefe he renderd up his royall brest, No solace would he take, nor any rest. Then grave Democritus inform'd the King, That he from death, to life his Queene would bring. If he would grant him, what he should entreat, For the effecting of a worke so great: Darius condescends, and bids him aske, What meanes he thought convenient for this taske: Names of three Persons onely he requested, That never had with sorrow beene molested, For losses of a kinsman, or a friend. The King then did strict inquisition send, Through all his Kingdomes, to search out such men: But when they could be no where found nor seene He found his errour, and the fatall law Of unmov'd destinye, and nature saw; Hence tooke he comfort, and with bounty high; The Wiseman for his cure did gratifie. Griefe is a passion, and all passions must Confined be, unto a measure just, Lest they like swelling spring-tides overthrow The bankes of Reason, and the same oreflow: Like Nilus they are not, who rising high Presageth plenty and fertility; Nor must they alway in their chanels runne Like him, but suffer intermission: For sorrow that is never spent or done, Flowes like th' infernall River Acheron: And they who with perpetuall grones expresse Their passions, for a freind gone hence in peace, Like croaking frogs in muddy styxe become, While the bewail'd enjoyes Elysium. Jove (on a time) the Goddesses did call To an assembly, where among them all He dignities and honours did impart, Well corresponding with each ones desart: Too late Dame-Sorrow to this meeting came, Whom Jove (for tardinesse) did justly blame For he bestow'd had all his gifts before, And had for her no honour left in store; But shee importun'd him, for to conferre Some favour, or gratuity on her: He (having nothing else) unto her lent The teares, and plaints, which are at fun'rals spent: Now as each Goddesse loves those persons well, Whose sweete oblations shee is wont to smell, So if to sorrw we shall often bring Sad sighes, and mourning, for an offering, Shee never will forsake us: But if we Neglect her humble votaries to be, Withdrawing those sad dueties shee requires, Like one despised, shee soone from us retires, If teares concern'd the good of soules deceast, Or if they could adde ought unto their rest, I should turne Heraclitus, and lament, Untill my eyes had all that moisture spent, Which from the braine they take (this being done) They should dissolve themselves, and in teares runne, Expending in an office so divine, Both humours aqueous, and christalline: But since that teares (on such occasions shed) Nor benefit the living, nor the dead, Let us them for a better end reserve; They rightly us'd, for pretious balmes may serve: Nor do I Stoicall paradoxes hold; For they deliver, that no Wiseman should Give way to griefes, I rather thinke it fitter, That none should drinke too deepe of cups so bitter: But never did excessive sorrowes merit Such liberty, and freedome to inherit, As lately, when shee left our horizon, Whose presence made our age a golden one: Honour, Griefe, Joy, shall never cease t'expresse Her Vertue, Death, and present happinesse: And if that Reason, shall prohibite all Immod'rate teares, for such a funerall, The Nights shall mourne in blackes, and Mornes, shall weepe, Untill Calista wakes, from her last sleepe. Eleg. 2. Retreate (sad passions) to your chanels now, Let sorrowes inundations cease to flow: Griefes, (which distinguish Mortals from the Gods) Ought to be limited with periods, Lest action by such torrents overborne, Should vertue leave abandon'd to the scorne Of faithlesse Fortune, her undoubted slave Then cease (ye weeping Hyades) to lave That marble shrine, wherein those reliques lye, Which (whilome) harbour'd such nobility, That all our teares shed there (though we were sure We could droppe richest pearles or amber pure) Were to be valu'd, or esteemd no more, Then if a cisterne small should spend his store, To gratifie the swelling Ocean: No more, then if fond Time should lend a spanne Of his finite dimension, to supply The wants of infinite Eternity. Her worth was so sublime, so cleare, so full, That humane intellects prove weake, and dull, While they the same contemplate, wanting might, (Like bastard Eaglets) to behold such light. The Caspian-seas stand mur'd in hilly bounds, Yea Neptunes Empire, airye Jove surrounds; A lucide Orbe of fire doth these enfold, The Heav'ns about the Elements are roul'd; Heav'ns are involv'd with Heav'ns; the stars decline Unto their periods: Time and Place confine This great magnificence of Natures store, But Shee (whose early absence we deplore) Surmounts all these immensities, as farre, As doth the largest sphere, the smallest starre. I injure her (I feare) while I compare Those things, which fraile, and transitory are, With that immortall, unimagin'd blisse, Which crownes her, in her Apotheosis; Then stoope (my Muse) from that celestiall place, Whose radiant lustre, and translucent grace, Those crowned Candidates can onely gust, Who have put off their mourning weedes of dust. Like that faire Bird, in snowy plumage drest, Which silver Po doth plow with his soft brest, Singing his requiem, to the sighing streame; So let my Muse assume the stately theme, Of true nobility, and reall worth, While shee in buskin'd straine, strives to set forth True honour to the life; list to my song, Yee that have soules; to you these Odes belong: If Men will not give eare, then Rockes and Trees Shall conge's give, and echo plaudit'es, While I of her doe sing: for vertues fire Doth animate more bodies, then the Lyre Of Orpheus could: her pure celestiall heate Invites the God's themselves, with Men to treat. Vertue alone, is to be valu'd more, Then many painted scutchions, or a score Of swelling titles, for numerous descents, And titles, be but her gay ornaments: It argues but a spirit dull and cold, To summon monuments and statues old, For proofe of gentry, or a name to reare, On what the wormes have left; as if we were Devoide of arts and hearts, whereby to merit That praise, and bayes, which vertue should inherit; And must become beholding unto stones, For all our stiles, and reputations: But where illust'rous ancestry we finde, Annexd unto an honourable minde, Nobility there shines like Luna bright, With orbed face, 'mongst starres of lesser light. As ciphers (by themselves) no summes designe, But if with figures ye the same combine, Large numbers they compose; so ancestry For nothing stands, if vertue be not by. What neede I thus expatiate, or search through The golden grove of ethickes, for to show A definition, or a character Of this heroicall habite, since in her (Of whom I sing) nobility did shine, With such pellucid rayes, and beames divine, That it essentiall seem'd, and not acquir'd; Not accidentall, but from heav'n inspir'd. Heav'n lent her to the earth, and would not trust With such a gemme (too long) a world of dust; But like a prudent Creditour becomes, That cals for quicke repayment of those summes, Which to profuser Prodigalls he lent, To free himselfe from further detriment, Which through forbearance of so large a debt, Must needs result; Had shee bin longer kept On Earth, perhaps base Earth would then have vaunted Of her fruition, whom the blest Heav'ns wanted. The Lilly, Rose, and fragrant Violet, Those choicest gemmes of Floras cabinet, Shew lifes epitomes, and then retreate To longer deaths, in Vestas bosome great: Where they must sleepe, until Apollo shall Come from his southerne progresse, and recall (With his reviving heate) them to review The world, and it adorne, with their bright hue: For as Antheus, by his stronger foe, Throwne to the earth, recover'd vigour so; So do terrestriall seedes from earth derive Their vitall strength, and humour nutritive. The Sunne resignes to Vesper, and each starre Retires at the returne of Phoebus carre; Thus by a naturall vicissitude, Alternally things alterd, are renewd In their corruptions, ever rise, and fall, 'Till in a conflagration generall, This World like the Arabian Bird shall burne, That an immortall Phoenix, from her urne May rise, arrayd with those illustr'ous plumes, Which neither age decayes, nor time consumes. But she (whom we lament) although she try'd No more then one short life, and but once dy'd, Yet her one funerall did on us light, More like a publike ruine, then the weight Of any private crosse, yea we may call Her death, a greivance epidemicall, A losse, which no reprisall can redresse, Whose greatnesse, rather silent griefes expresse, Then golden lines, for passions doe exceed Those measures, which the modest Muses tread, Nor can the sorrowes of a troubled mind, By any penne, or pencill be confin'd. But whether strayes my wandring Muse misled Through Labyrinthes of cares, by sorrowes threed, As if shee were intent, with dreary layes, To ayme at Cypresse wreaths, not crownes of bayes: Let sad Electra, hidden in her sphere, Lament incinerated Ilium there: Let Niobe in Sypileian stone, Latonas hate, and her owne pride bemone: Let Biblis melted to a cold cleere bourne, For her incest'ous fires still waile and mourne. Yea let ambiguous teares those fun'ralls steepe, Where riper Heires, or yonger widdowes weepe: Like personated Mourners at the graves, Of some old crabbed, and decrepit knaves. Such fain'd libations we abhorre, and feare To make false immolations unto her, Who was so true, so noble, so divine, In name, and really a Derivat a Graec ???????? purus. Katherine. Shee had no spots like Cynthia, nor was shee Mercuriall, or like light Cythere: But shee Astraea was: Astraea just, Who fleeing hence, did leave old Time in trust, To keepe in wardrobe cold her robes of clay; But if these shall through his neglect decay, Yet shall shee find at last this vesture fraile, Transmuted to a fresh immortall veyle. Eleg. 3. 1 When Hils, and Valleys, wrap't in sheets of snow, Did pennance for their summer luxury, And Winter old unto the world did show, The Sceletons of trees, muffling the skye With vapours cold, and strewing frequently The earth with wat'ry confects, then I stood On that fair tract, where Bure creeps lazily To pay his tribute to a greater flood, Cleapt Yar, none of the meanest of blew Neptunes brood. 2 There I beheld the snowy Swannes retreate, Unto the silver creekes, with motion sad: Each face of things exprest a ruine great, But two-fac'd Janus all in sable clad, Those joyous sports, and merryments forbad, Which whilome he was wont to tolerate: The Gods themselves (it seemes) a feeling had, Of our disasters, when Calista's fate, Our sorrowes, and her endlesse joyes did propagate. 3 Calista faire, at whose nativity, All happy starres auxiliary were, With kind aspects, shining auspiciously: For as each gentle God and Goddesse cleere, Pandora did adorne with bount'ous cheere, Placing on her all properties divine, Which made her so unparallel'd appeare; So did both fix'd, and errant starres combine With pretious gifts, to dignifie this Heroine. 4 Though from illustr'ous ancestors shee came, From Lords sublim'd, for chivalrous renowne; Yet did her vertues overtoppe her name, And all those adventitious glories crowne, Which Fortune, or high birth, had on her throwne: Her piety, and worth, was so immense, That Heav'n (it seemes) sent this Panthea downe, As some great blessing, but revok'd her hence For our ingratitude, or some such high offence. 5 Death like Ulysses (while we were intent To sports, and triumphes, dreading no distresse, And fearelesse of so dire an accident) Stole our Palladium hence, the Patronesse Of all our hopes, and chiefest happinesse: Then Feasts were turn'd to funerals, no name Was heard that any solace did expresse, And all our mirth, like burning Troy became, Consum'd to cinders blacke, in griefes uncessant flame. 6 As when the Vestall fires extinguish'd were, Through some unhappy Virgins fraile neglect, Then Romes Patricians, fraught with dreary cheere, In mourning habits dight, were wont t'expect The dreadfull issue, of some dire effect; So when that lucid flame, which did maintaine, Calista's life by cruell death was check't, Sighes did abound, and sorrowes flow amaine, Eyes did their bankes inundate and each cheeke distaine. 7 Man's a plant animall, a tree revers't, Whose root's the braine, his limmes the branches be, But blood's the sappe, through every veyne dispers't, Which aliment imparts with justice free, Unto each member of this mysticke tree: Haire[s] are the leaves, which doe the same attire, Excrescent humours are the gummes (we see) Flowing from thence; the fruite which doth aspire, Be actions good, or ill; the seede whereof's desire. 8 But our faire plant, (the fairest that ere grew) Such apples on her Verdant branches bare, As the Hesperian Gardens never knew, Nor had Alcinous any fruite so rare; Shee was a tree, with which none might compare: This Tree by Heavn's decree transplanted is; We of her happy shade deprived are, While shee remov'd into eternall blisse, Becomes a Tree of life, in highest Paradise. 9 Letter-puff'd Pedants boldly dare averre, That every starre another world containes; These, Cities in the skyes would seeme to reare, Yet build but Castles in the ayre (fond swaines) That strange conclusions, from fanaticke braines Strive to produce, when they below might see (Perhaps) more Worlds; for Verity maintaines That Man's a Microcosme; each he or shee Is of a greater World, the briefe epitome. 10 Mans head is heav'n, the brighter starres fix'd there Are Fancy, Intellect, and Memory, The sences eke like Planets do appeare, Each in his sphere, the Heart which doth supply All parts with vitall heate, is Phoebus high; The liver is the Moone, whose pregnant brests With purple joyce embalmes this Monarchy; Foure Humours are the Elements, and these The basement doe compose of this celestiall piece. 11 But such a world was our Calista bright, As was the world, before it injurd was, Through Womans weakenesse, and a Serpents spite: For as a seven-fold lustre then did grace Each glorious starre, and planet, in his place; As then earth bred no plant of bad effects, Nor nourish'd any beast of savage race; So clearest worth adorn'd in all respects, This peerelesse Dame, who was the glory of her sexe. 12 Sharp-sighted Speculatists perhaps may find The causes of those colours, that array The flowry meades in May, some subtile mind May the abstruse decrees of starres survey, Or light on the (long sought for) North-west way Th' Elixir may be found by Art; the cause Of swift Euripus fluxe, Time may bewray: But never shall appeare in time, or place So rare a creature, as divine Calista was. 13 Nature turnd Spagyricke in forming her: Of ordinary stuffe shee was not made, But of extracted matter, pure, and cleere, Which Natures Chymistrie prepared had, By separating the good, from the bad: This happy temper did in her impresse, Those rich endowments, with which she was clad; Vertue, and Beauty; Women blest with these Become incarnate Angels, earthly Goddesses. 14 As that faire Picture of the Cyprian Queene, Drawne by the Coan Painter, did exceed The bravest pieces, that were ever seene, Though it was not complete, nor finished; Even so Calista's life though soone it fled, Ere shee of youth had pass'd the vernall Line, Before Time had her to her Solstice led; Yet this short life of hers was so divine, That it long lives of earthly Saints seem'd to out shine. 15 And though her lustre was extinct so soone, Yet shee no Comet was, no falling starre, No fading Meteour, or changing Moone; But shee a Sphere was, wherein Vertues rare, Like fix'd auspicious Asterismes did glare, Whose glories did the Deitie invite, To free this blessed Orbe, from earthly care, Transposing her to his eternall light, So to augment the splendor of his kingdome bright. 16 Shee was betimes discharg'd from griefes, and feares; Yea grant, shee might have in terrestriall blisse, Exceeded a whole Myriade of yeares; Yet had shee bin no more like what she is, Than Atomes be to largest substances, For things finite, no due proportion hold, With any infinite existences: But in some measure, may our eyes behold Her past, and present state, by setting drosse to gold. 17 By helpe of Jacobs staffe, the Artist wise May take the altitude of any starre; But Jacobs ladder onely will suffice, For us to view those blessings singular, Wherewith all pious Soules enriched are, The pretious bowels of Mount Potosin, Pearles and rich Amber, which the Seas prepare, The choisest gemmes of Natures Magazine, Are meerely counterfeits, compar'd with wealth divine. 18 (Oh lovely Sexe) the Worlds most faire halfe part, That ar't by heav'ns high providence designd, To be a coadjutrice, to impart Constant duration, to that mortall kind, Which God hath with his proper image sign'd, This pretious jewells losse doe thou lament, By whom thou didst such estimation finde; For shee is gone, whose vertues excellent, The chiefest price and lustre to all females lent. 19 (Ye gentle Ladyes) Luminaries bright Of this worlds sphere, terrestriall Goddesses, That murther like the Basiliskes with sight, Who are by Natures bounty, grac'd no lesse, Then Arts, and ornaments advantages; By her example faire discerne, and see The way, that leades to truest happinesse; Tread ye Calista's pathes, and strive to be As chast, as pious, and as good, as late was shee. 20 Shee was: her glasse is runne; her periods done; Oh sentence fraught with dole and dreary care. She was esteem'd the ages Parragon, For qualities, and all those habits rare, Wherein heroicall beauties ought to share; Oh honourd name, and fame that never dyes. Shee is inthron'd above the highest starre, Crown'd with the summe of all felicities; Oh blisse, not to be seene by any mortall eyes. Epicedium. Needes Shee another Monument of stone, Who had so many better than this one: All which were Noble Hearts, whom her decease, Transmuted into marble Niobes: Each tombe was arch'd about with weeping eyes, Whom sorrowes blasts, did likewise cristalize: True Piety, Vertue, Love, and honourd Blood, On both sides, as Corinthian columnes stood: Three Children Angels were, which did disperse Youth, Beauty, Wealth, like flowers on each herse: A foliage of humane fraile estate, The basement of the worke did variate: But Glory like a Pyramid above, The Fabricke crown'd, and reach'd the Court of Jove. Though these, renowned Mausoleums were, Yet her sad Consort rear'd this structure here, That future Ages might from it collect, Her matchlesse merit, and his true respect. FINIS. A GALLERY TO THE TEMPLE. LYRICALL POEMES UPON SACRED OCCASION[S] Yea, upon the Harpe, will I Praise Thee, Oh God, My GOD. Psal 43. v. 4 For my Lady Paston The Dedication (My Lord) who with acceptance dids't regarde The sinnefull Maryes penitentiall teares, As well as her fine Boxe of pretious Narde, Vouchsafe to take my humble, holy verse, Which for thy Head, affordes no Unguent sweet, But onely water for to bathe thy feet./ [1] The Incarnation. (My God) who dids't thy glorious throne forsake, And from a Virgin pure thy manhood take, That Thou, thereby mights't us thy brethren make: Was ever love like thine? Both Men, and Angells, at thy birth did sing, And thy propicious starre did tideings bring, That Night departed, and the day did spring: Was ever love &amp;c. Though by the Fathers side, thou well mighs't clayme The whole worlds empire, yet thou didst not ayme At soveraignty, which makes us to exclayme: Was ever love &amp;c. And though, thy Mother was of Jesse's stemme, Entitleing Thee, to Judah's diademe, Yet thou didst not this dignity esteeme: Was ever love &amp;c. Thou cams't in silence, like the evening dew, Into a fleece of wooll, wer't seene by few, But fewer thought thee our Messias true: Was ever love &amp;c. The dayes departed long 'ere they grew old, But Night did many howres her station hold, The world gave thee but entertainement cold: Was ever love &amp;c. Long were the nights, and cold, but longer Night Of sinne, and love wax'd cold, did Thee invite, Our hearts to warme, and guide us by thy light, Was ever love &amp;c. A stable was thy palace, and a manger Thy cradle was: yet thou (so poore a stranger) Wer't of a jealous Tyrants wrath in danger. Was ever love &amp;c. It could not halfe so strange a sight appeare, To see the sunne descend from his bright sphere, As it was to behold thy presence here: Was ever love &amp;c. Thou to thy natives first thy self dids't render, Whose dazled eyes could not endure thy splendour; But strangers did rich offr'ings to Thee tender: Was ever love &amp;c. Thou, who dids't all in dignity surpasse, Whom Angells prais'd with Alleluiah's, Becams't camrade unto the Oxe and Asse; Was ever love &amp;c. Thou, who wer't clad with divine majesty, Dids't shift thy self into humanity, That wee might put on immortality: Was ever love &amp;c. Thou Lord wer't Hee, who (us from Hell to save) Dids't wedde thy Godhead even unto the grave; Hee, who both life, and glory for us gave: Was ever love &amp;c. Thou, (who dids't laws dispense in Sinai Hill) In thine owne person dids't the same fulfill; Yea dids't to humane lawes submitt thy will: Was ever love &amp;c. Though cruell Herod quak'd at thy approch, Thou dids't not on th' usurpers pow'r incroche: Thou dids't exchange thy scepter for reproche, Was ever love like thine? Though Kings (as God and King) did Thee adore, And rich oblations powre out Thee before, Yet for our sakes Thou didst thy self make poore: Was ever love &amp;c. The Infants blood (lesse innocent then thine) Shed in their early martyrdome did signe Th' assurance of thy presence most divine: Was ever love &amp;c. Thou from the bloudy Tyrants rage didst flee, And in the land of bondage dids't live free, Untill Death Herod call'd, and recall'd Thee. Was ever love &amp;c. Then Thou in despisd Galile dids't stay, Till John the Baptist did prepare thy way, And thy approch unto the world bewray: Was ever love &amp;c. Hee was a Morning starre, which did forerunne Thy riseing (oh bright orientall sunne) Which didst dispell that night, which sinne begunne: Was ever love &amp;c. Since the first Herods rage could not Thee harme, A second Herod did against Thee arme, The First us'd force: but this sought Thee to charme: Was ever love &amp;c. But Thou the Charmer charmds't, and by a spell Dids't send th' old serpent backe unto his cell, There to lament, bicause his kingdome fell. Was ever love &amp;c. Then Thou dids't preach repentance unto all, And from their nettes didst thy Disciples call, And mad'st them fish for creatures rationall: Was ever love like thine? Thou mad'st the Deafe to heare, gav'st blind men eyes, Dids't cure the lame, and cleanse all leprosyes, Dids't cast out Devills, and make dead men rise: Was ever love &amp;c. Huge multitudes, did then upon the[e] wayte, Thy miracles were unto them a bayte, Some when their turnes were serv'd, forgott the[e] strayte: Was ever love &amp;c. The first law in a mountaine was decreed, And from a mount the second did proceede, Where Thou dids't first sowe thy celestiall seede: Was ever love &amp;c. There, thou didst then such blessed doctrine preach, As none before or since did ever teach, So farre it went beyond all humane reach: Was ever love &amp;c. Thou by examples, and instructions sage, Dids't strive to purge the vices of the age, While Thou hat'st Sinne; against Thee Sinners rage: Was ever love &amp;c. Like savage Beasts, without all intermission, They rag'd against their God, and their Physicion, And their Redeemer threaten'd with perdition: Was ever love &amp;c. Yet Thou didst not retarde thy worke in hand, But dids't observe thy Fathers just command, Mans sinne, could not thy mercy great withstand, Was ever love &amp;c. Thy Workemen Thou dids't send into the field, To gather in thy corne before it shill'd, But these thy Reapers were contemn'd, and kill'd: Was ever love &amp;c. Thou to the simple dids't thy truth unlocke, While that the learned sort did floute, and mocke, Because it was to them a stumbling blocke: Was ever love &amp;c. Thou dids't in holy parables transmitt Such blessed documents, as never yet Could imitated bee, by humane witt: Was ever love &amp;c. The quintessence of wisedome, did distill From thy most hallow'd lippes: and Thou dids't fill The world with wonders, through thy heavenly skill: Was ever love &amp;c. Nor dids't Thou onely with a touch, or word, Diseases heale, and remedyes afford, For with cures were thy very garments stor'd: Was ever love &amp;c. Thy reprehensions, like thy thunder were, Empressing terrours, but thy comforts deare, Dejected soules did quicken and upreare: Was ever love &amp;c. Thy counsells could not erre, for Thou wer't Truth: No double Oracles fell from thy mouth, Thou wer't a Doctour, ere Thou wer't a youth Was ever love &amp;c. The Jewes did Thee expect a Conquerour, But Thou, (though comeing like a Pilgrime poore) Such conquests wonns't, as none e're wonne before: Was ever love &amp;c. The Flesh with all his lusts Thou dids't subdue; Nothing but Love, and Wisedome in Thee grew: No Age did ever such a Victour shew: Was ever love &amp;c. Thou didst subdue all worldly vanityes, Both honour, wealth, and pleasure dids't despise; None ever did achieve such victoryes. Was ever love &amp;c. Yea Thou didst triumphe over Death, and Hell, And Satan from the skyes like lightening fell, Forc'd to retreate to his infernall cell: Was ever love &amp;c. Thou mads't his cousening Oracles to cease, And while the dumbe were taught Thee to confesse, The Lyer was compell'd to hold his peace: Was ever love &amp;c. The carnall Jewes did earnestly expect, That Thou their broken scepter shoulds't connect, But Thou a greater Kingdom cams't t'erect: Was ever love &amp;c. Through Thee, they thought t'have bene avenged on, Proud Rome, and not forgotten Babylon: But Thou cam'st to destroy a greater throne: Was ever love &amp;c. Bondslaves to sinne wee were, but Thou wer't Hee, Who from this thraldome cams't to sett us free, And with thy bloud dids't buy our libertye: Was ever love &amp;c. Both Devills, and incarnate Devills sought, To hinder Thee, in what Thou wertst about; Thus Man against his Lord, and Saviour fought: Was ever love &amp;c. The Preists consulted, how They might Thee kill, The Pharises combin'd, thy blood to spill, Because to save their soules it was thy will: Was ever love &amp;c. The brutish Saduces Thou didst confute, And mad'st the Scribes, and Pharises as mute As mushromes, when they did 'gainst Thee dispute: Was ever love like thine? For in the Desert, Thou dids't first refell Th' assaults of the old Sophister of Hell, Therefore his Schollers, Thou mighs't vanquish well: Was ever love &amp;c. But after many miracles achiev'd, Thine owne Disciples scarce in thee beleev'd, And with their incredulity, Thee griev'd: Was ever love &amp;c. Though Thou, three yeares hadst them instructed well, By words, and wonders, yet they could not tell, The right sence, of this word Emanuel. Was ever love &amp;c. So unfitt are the best of us to learne, What doth our chiefest benefitt concerne, And good from evill, aptly to discerne: Was ever love &amp;c. Thou with few loaves, dids't thousands fill (wee reade) To shew, that Thou, who a'rt the heavenly bread, Shoulds't all refresh, which rightly on thee feede: Was ever love &amp;c. Thou, with a word didst calme the surgeing seas, At thy rebuke, the windes to rage did cease, To shew, how Thou wer't God, and King of peace: Was ever love &amp;c. To feede with sinners, Thou dids't not disdaine, That by instructions, and examples plaine, Thou mights't them to thy heavenly kingdome gaine: Was ever love &amp;c. Dead bodyes, and dead soules Thou dids't revive; None ever did such blessed physicke give, With thine owne bloud, Thou mads't thy Patients live: Was ever love &amp;c. No wicked Agag suffer'd by thy sword, No Ananias perish'd by thy word; Nothing but life, and health, Thou didst afford: Was ever love &amp;c. When thy Disciples for destructive fire Did call: Thou dids't reprove their zealous ire; The death of sinners Thou dids't not desire: Was ever love &amp;c. Thou cam'st not for to breake a reede that's brus'd, To quench the smokeing flaxe Thou were't not us'd: Sinners by Thee were not judg'd, but excus'd: Was ever love &amp;c. Thou knewst, the Jewes thy ruine did intend, And how they lay in wayte Thee t'apprehend, Yet Thou woulds't to Jerusalem ascend: Was ever love &amp;c. For triumph Thou didst ride on a yong asse, The Jewes Hosannah cry'd, as Thou dids't passe, Thy way with palmes, and garments strewed was: Was ever love &amp;c. They cry'd Hosannah then, who afterward, Cryd, Crucifye him: let the Thiefe bee spard: More for a Thiefe, then for their King they car'd: Was ever love &amp;c. Thou to comply with thy Deare Fathers will, (Oh Lambe unspotted) didst the votes fulfill, Of cruell wolves, who sought thy bloud to spill: Was ever love &amp;c. Since from thy wounded corps, Thou well dids't know, Such fructifyeing showres should spring, and flow, As might make us, like Trees of life to grow: Was ever love &amp;c. What can Man doe more then dye for's freind? But Thou, (both God and Man) dids't condiscend Even for thy Foes, thy pretious blood to spend: Was ever love like thine? [2] The Passion Who can reviewe, without a pretious losse Of teares, the bitter sorowes of thy crosse (Oh Dearest Lord) Whose corps was gor'd, In every member, by remorseles steele, That wee (thy Members) might not Tophet feele— Thy feet (Oh God) Which never trod In sinnefull pathes, with bloudy nayles were pierc'd; Because wee in ungodly wayes were vers'd: Thy hands most pure, Were forc'd t'endure The self same paines; because our hands have bin, Vile instruments of wickednes, and sinne: Thy temples blest With thornes were prest: Because wee have (upon our pillowes soft) Mischievous stratagems imagin'd oft: Thy heart most just, And free from lust, Was wounded too; because our hearts most evill, Through pride, and lust, were censers for the Devill. What I expresse, Must needes be lesse Then thy sharp paines, for the whole Continent, Of thy chast corps, was into one wound rent: Who can reflect, With dry aspect, Upon thy torments? Oh that I could weepe, Till I did swimme in my repentance deepe, Since for my guilt, Thy bloud was spilt: But I am whelm'd, in sorowes, and in feares, Because I cannot drowne my sinnes in teares: What shall I say? I thus will pray. As bloud, and water issu'd from thy wound, So with thy bloud, doe Thou my teares compound./ [3] The Deprecation (Lord) cease this direfull tintamarre Of civill warre: The bellowing drumme, and trumpet shrill, Are musicke meete, Rather for flameing Sinai Hill, Then Sion sweet. The Gospell came in a still voyce, Although the Law was given with horride noyse. The Axes, and the hammers sound, Did not rebound, In thy first Temple; and much lesse, Should tumults rage, Within thy second House of peace, Late made a stage, Where clamr'ous Furyes acte their parts, A dreadfull spectacle to pious hearts. Thou cams't downe (oh Messias true) Like the calme dew, On Gedeon's fleece: And being here, Didst not exclayme, None in the streetes thy voyce did heare, But as a Lambe, Before the shearer, Thou wer't dumbe: In silent manner, Thou dids't goe and come. But Hee, who doth pretend to bee, Thy Feoffee: Hee, who thy Vicar himself calls, Makes such a noyse, With Prelates proud, and Cardinalls, That Hee annoyes The World, and breakes the sleepes of Kings: His pride pontificall through all lands rings. His anger, like an Earthquake, shockes Both Hills, and rockes: And t'is more hard him to appease, Then to still windes, Or pacifye the rageing seas: The hands he bindes Of Monarkes, and keepes them in awe, (As Hindes doe birds) by men of ragges and straw. The sound of his Apostles runnes In drummes, and gunnes, Through the whole Earth, for where His word Cannot prevaile, They (for their ends) employ the sword; And if this faile, They treach'rous plottes contrive, and can Father all mischiefes, on the Puritan./ Our Caballs, and our cajoleings, Are subtile things, Of their invention, words of art, Made to beguile An honest, and well meaneing heart. By the new style Wee write, and acte: By th' old alone, Wee measure time from th' Incarnation./ Lots wife on Sodome did reflect, But one aspect, And shee for this insipide tricke, Was turn'd into A rocke of salt, which Beasts did licke: The Hebrewes too, When they for Egypts flesh did lust, Were sharply punish'd, by God's vengeance just. And while wee vainly did looke backe, On Egypt blacke, And Sodome foule, the Lord above Did us chastise, Because wee did backsliders prove, And with fond eyes, The pleasures of that bondage sought, From whence, by miracle wee had bene brought. Each Hat was of a Roman blocke; Cassocke, and cloke, Were of the Babylonian size; But what is worse, Our hearts were Romish in disguise, And by recourse To their vaine rites, gave reasons strong, That for Italian Melons wee did long. (Lord) wee have sinn'd: and doe not seeke A Moses meeke, To worke our peace, but thine owne Sonne: Whom wee implore; His bloud did us with Thee attone, In time of yore: And by His bloud, wee crave now (Lord) That our bloud may bee staunch'd, and peace restord. [4] Solitude Though to the world I seeme to bee, Mix'd in a concurse of societye, Farre from a life contemplative, Yet with a Desert I dare strive, For solitude, and in this can Both personate the Owle, and Pellican. The tender Bee doth dwell All winter, in his warme sexangled cell: Untill Aurora bright besmeares The woods, with her melliflo'us teares, And to the feilds doth him invite, With new borne flowres, to feast his appetite. But I am to my cell confin'd, By longer winter and blasts more unkind, Then those of Boreas, where I doe Endeavour to improve my woe, (And though uncloyster'd) yet dare vye Sad howres, with the monasticke Votarye. While in this vale of teares I stay, Those upper springs unto mee Lord bewray, That when these nether springs are dry'd, Those may arise with a full tide, To cleanse the guilt of that defect, Which my two nether springs could not effect. [5] Resolution Man's destin'd for eternall blisse, or paine; And shall wee for a momentaneous blast Of secular delights, neclect to gaine Beatitude, which shall for ever last? Let Man from guilty joyes refraine, And of forbidden apples feare to taste; For though the fruite may seeme faire to the eye A serpent hid beneath the leaves doth lye./ A short life, and a merry many wish: But for eternity is my desire, I am a volatile, and not a fish, Which from his drinke sequester'd doth expire: I dote not on a cup, or dish: My hopes are level'd for a marke that's higher, Short, or long, sweet, or sowre, let this life bee I care not (Lord) so I may live with Thee./ [6] Blindnes Our eyes are veyl'd with flesh and bloud: Wee cannot see, What hath relation to our good: Our judgements bee Benighted by the world: wee are all blind, Like those which grop'd the doore of Lot to find. The Scripture is a perspicill, Which us instructs, We choose the good, and leave the ill: But it's conducts Wee slight, and leave this Load starre cleare, By Ignis Fatuus our course to steere. The subterraneous Mole, And scarabye, (This loves the doung, that the darke hole) True Emblemes bee Of humane nature; but that Man's an Eagle, Whom nor the world, nor pleasures can inveigle. [7] The Newyeares Gift This is the time, when that the Druid's sage, Their mysticke Mistleto, Divided to The superstitious Vulgar, as a gage Of future happynes, And good successe, Which unto them the Newborne yeare should give: At this time freinds did try, For to comply, And with their mutuall donatives did strive, To strengthen, or renue Affection true: But now my taske it is, and my delight, To heighten, and improve Diviner love: And t'wixt my God, and mee, to sett things right; To whom I did commend, And humbly send A Heart with praises fraught: My gracious Lord Accepted of my strene, With lookes serene; Hee kept my praises, but my heart restor'd, Replenish'd with content, Most excellent: And I this Newyeares gift esteemed more, Then all, which ever I receiv'd before./ [8] Sciences Many their language labour to correct, And for to speake in the best dialect, But few, or none contend Their lives t'amend. Logicke, the art of reason others love, But by their lives, their studyes they disprove, Guided by appetite, Not Reasons light. Some divide numbers by Arithmeticke, To smallest fractions, yet they want a tricke, One penney to divide, To those that neede. Another by Geometry (at pleasure) Both Cittyes feilds, and provinces can measure; Yet in his life (God knowes) No measure showes. One studyes the accord of pleasant sounds, While in his heart, with discord Hee abounds: Hee's out of tune within, Through his vaine sinne. Th' Astrologer doth gaze upon the starres, Till like a falling starre Hee unawares, In a pitt plunged is, That's bottomles. Another boasts diseases all to cure, Yet findes not his owne pulse, or temp'rature: His Heart a Spittle is Of maladyes. Of Troy, and Thebes th' Historian can discourse, Of Alexander Great, and of his horse, Yet doth a babe become, —In things at home. Another doth professe, law to dispense, But gives no law to his owne conscience: Hee cares more for a fee, Then equitye. The Theologians rather strive to know Gods will, then doe the same, their actions grow Contrary to their speech, And what they preach. Most studye sciences, not charity, Which is 'twixt God, and Man the perfect tye: (Oh Lord) instruct mee how To love, and know. [9] Teares Teach me the art of teares, Thou Lord of joy, learne mee to swimme in sorow, Both at this present, and to morow, For sinnes of many yeares, And in this bitter deluge drowne my feares. (Lord) Thou dids't for me sweate, Pure rubyes, in thy pretious agonye, Why should I render then to thee, Pearles that are counterfeyte, Farre too unworthye of thy cabinet. Thou, by thy grace divine, Cans't worke my teares to orientall gemmes, More rich then those of diadem's If Thou shalt in mee shine; Mine is the comfort, but the glory thine. Could I bothe th' Indyes gaine, To bowell, and impoverish their rich wombes: Or might I have Arabia's gummes, I should from these abstaine; The richer treasures of thy grace t'obtaine. Oh let my sorowes source, From vapours, and pure exhalations flow, Which by thy spirit first did grow; Oh pitty my remorse, (That am vile earth) in these thy meteours. [10] Securitye Th' unactive Element, In Man is most predominant: Earth is his belov'd home, and his content: Hee well could heavenly gloryes want, If Hell, or Death did not him sometimes fright: Hee feares the grave, though Earth bee his delight. Yet Hee lives, as if Hell, Were but a fable, or a storye, A place of fancye, that might paralell The old S? Patrickes Purgatory. Hee mirth recrutes with cup's, and seldome thinkes Of Death, untill into the grave Hee sinkes. But if vaine Man knew well, To fixe and mannage his designe, Hee should not stand in feare of Death or Hell. For Hee's immortall, and divine: Flesh is his clogge, which while Hee strives to lighten More heavy growes: Thus Hee his woes doth heighten. [11] The Bankrupte God, with the breath of life did mee inspire, And in the world mee landed, where, I like a stranger could but things admire, Being unfitt for pratticke there: For I, of language had not the least tittle; Could neither call for drinke, or bread: But when I grew acquainted but a little, And could without a Truchman trade: Then I forgott my home, and did neclect Th' imployment, I was sent about; I forraine pleasures then 'gan to affect, And like unthrifty Factours sought, Not my Lords profite, but mine owne delight: Both wine, and women did mee please: The women of the land were faire to sight, And made mee leave my busynes. My Lord did then of my debauchments heare, And to a strict account mee brought, But I could not responsible appeare, I so extremely had runne out. Then I emprisonment, and bonds did feare, And like a perplex'd Caitife stood: Untill a freind did whisper in mine eare, And told me that my Lord was good: Hee mee advis'd to sue for mercy: Then I fell downe prostrate at his feet, Which with my teares to bathe I did beginne, Th' unfained signes of my regreet. My gracious Lord did then my debt remitt; Nor did his goodnes end in this For Hee to mee more treasures did committ, And more esteem'd commodityes, Then Hee with mee before intrusted had; Thus I who was his wretched Debtour, His Beneficiarye blest was made, And then resolv'd to serve him better. [12] Griefe Griefe seas'd upon my soule, No holy griefe, But griefe profane, and foule, Hee like a Thiefe Invaded mee by night, but one more strong, Did him cast out, and vindicate my wrong. Hee to mee did object, Those miseryes, Which I must here expect, And on mee flyes, As if Hee meant to take away my life, But God was my assistant in this strife. Yet since it is decreed, That Griefe must bee, Conjoyn'd to Adams seede: (Oh Lord) let mee That griefe alone admitt of, and take in, Which doth relate to mine, and Adams Sinne./ [13] Truth (Faire naked Amazon) Invincible in force, Earths Martyr, but Heavens Minion, Religions source, The Mistris of the intellect, A Mistris without blemish, or defect. Great Monosyllable, The large epitome, Of bookes innumerable, That honest bee: Elder then Time thou art, yet youth Doth flourish in thy lookes: Thy name is Truth. Thy Habitation is In some abstruse recesse, Not obvious to the facultyes, Of infirme crests: Nor yet to sense, although shee trye To reach thee, by the pole of phantasye. Sciences (without Thee) Are tales of Robin Hood; No more then dreames of Fairyes bee; Nothing is good Where Thou art absent, but thy presence Gives worth, and reputation to each essence./ Commerce is (without Thee) Mere Cousenage, and Warre, Nothing but a grand larcenye: Thy vertues are Incomputable, and thy beauty From Man, and Angells, chalengeth loves duety. Democritus, Thee hidde In a darke gloomy roome: But once (I know) Thou dids't proceede From the pure wombe, Of an unviolated Mayde, When that a starre thy birth to Kings bewray'd. In little Bethleem, Thou then dids't shew thy face; And after (like the Spanish streame) Thou for a space, Lays't hid in Nazareth, untill The Lord made thee appeare on Sion Hill. To sweet Mount Olivet, The King of Truth, and Peace, Did oftentimes with his, retreate: A fitt recesse For Him, and for his contemplations, Who th' Herald was of peace, unto all Nations. Hee was the Word of Truth, The light of Veritye, Which it self disperst from his mouth, Both farre and nigh: And though Hee, our Horizon left, Yet of his rayes wee were not quite bereft: For though from us Hee went, Hee left us not alone: But downe His Holy Spirit sent, From his high Throne: This is that Truth of truths, and peace, Wherein consiste, our hopes and happynes. [14] The Vote The Helmett now an hive for Bees becomes, And hilts of swords may serve for Spiders loomes, Sharp pikes may make, Teeth for a rake: And the keene blade, th' arch enemy of life, Shall bee digraded to a pruneing knife: The rusticke spade Which first was made For honest agriculture, shall retake It's primitive imployment, and forsake The rempires steepe, And trenches deepe. Tame conyes in our brazen gunnes shall breed, Or gentle Doves, their yong-ones there shall feede: In musket barrells Mice shall raise quarrells For their quarters: The ventriloquious drumme (Like Lawyers in vacations) shall be dumme: Now all recrutes (But those of fruites) Shall bee forgott: and th' unarm'd Soldier, Shall onely boast of what Hee did whilere, In chimneys ends, Among his freinds./ If good effects shall happy signes ensue, I shall rejoyce, and my prediction's true. [15] The Antiphon Chorus./ Prais'd bee our Great Creatour, Angells./ In the skyes. Men./ In earth and water. Cho./ Who doth not his workes despise An. Us Hee loves. Men. And us improves. Cho. How His goodnes sweet abounds? An. In our glory. M. And his sonnes wounds. Cho. Though Wolves this Lambe did worry, An. Yet Hee rose, M. To shame his foes. Cho. Hee did triumphe over Hell. An. Satan bounde. M. And Death did quell. Cho. Hee in Heaven with glory crown'd, An. With us stayes, M. And for us prayes; Cho./ What tongue can his praises speake? An. Ours want might. M. Ours are too weake. Cho./ Wee blesse his name, Who in light, Men with Angells, doth unite. [16] Crosses Oh what fraile things Are Kings? They seeme immortall Gods, Yet have their periods: And must take harbour in that cell, Where wormes unhospitall doe dwell: Who (like Lycaon) doe each guest devoure Bee Hee a peasant, or an Emperour. One King alone, Did shunne Corruption, but not The Graves unsatiate throte: This King did weare a wreath of thorne, Which him did wound, but not adorne: A bloudy crosse of wood Hee made his throne, Although Hee might have had a golden one. Villaines forlorne, In scorne Him hayl'd. His subjects cry'd, Let him bee crucify'd. One of his Vassalls did him judge; Yet Hee tooke all without a grudge: Since that the King of Kings endur'd such losses, How can fraile Kings scape thorny cares, and crosses. [17] The Sute Lord winnowe mee from the vile dust Of vaine desires: Refine mee from my drosse, and rust, In gentle fires, Let mee not perish in the day Of thy displeasure: But so prepare mee, that I may Become thy treasure: Bruise mee not with an iron rodde, Oh breake mee not, That am a despicable clod, An earthen pot. A vessell of iniquitye, And fitt to bee A vassall to Hells Tyrannie, If it please Thee. But Thou oh Lord dos't not desire A Sinners death: Nor to consume those in thine ire, Whom thou gavs't breath. Conversion not confusion, Thou Delightest in. Thou quicke to mercy art, but slow To punish sinne. Wee day by day doe Thee incense, Yet Thou dost still Abound in thy beneficence, As if thy will, To workes of mercy were confin'd: Yea even as though Thou could'st not any arrow find, To fitt thy bowe: Yet the whole World's thine Armarye; Both sea, and land, Yea Heaven and all, with armes supply Thy dreadfull hand. The Angells thy Militia are, Sinners thy foes, Yet Thou ar't slow to denounce warre, Or fight 'gainst those: Thine Angells sinn'd but once, yet were Undone for ever: But Man seven times a day may erre, Yet perish never. Why shouldst Thou thus thy glory mixe, With pride and lust? Or favours upon statues fixe Of clay and dust? Man of two natures doth consist; For Thou (oh Lord) These diffr'ent substances didst twiste, In the fraile corde Of humane essence, that Man might Thy viceroy prove On Earth; But bee thy Psalmist bright In heaven above: (Lord) polish with thy supreme grace, My better part: Let not vaine desires it deface, Or get the start Of my incorruptible love: Then I shall here Thy psalmes endite; and bee above, Thy Quirister. [18] Hypocrisie The barbr'ous Turkes, are Men of the long robe; Yet on the surface of the earthly globe, Scarce any Nation is, So ignorant as this. Nor is there any wickedness so foule, As that which lyes beneath the holy cowle: But still wee must except the Jesuites cloke, Which large enough is to become a poke, For Iliad's of evills, And bee th' Asyle of Devills. For Mischiefe no where doth so safely lye, As underneath the veyle of sanctitye: A Spanish ruffe, or a Venetian vest, Of gravity, may seeme the very nest But Pandares, Whores, and Night Can easily recite, Strange tales, concerning These, who wont to use The Counsell Hall by day, by night the stewes: Man is what Hee doth least appeare: On earth, an arrant Cousener: But God shall him unrippe (at the last day) And all his secret villanyes display. [19] The Conception The glorious sunne forgetts his birth, And couples with the humble earth, Her wombe impregnates with warme showres, Produceing fruites and flowres: This an unequall match may seeme: Then what was that? when Jesse's stemme, Was overshadow'd from above, Courted by divine love: Here Immortality vouchsaf'd On mortall stocke to bee ingraff'd, And Jesse's roote produc'd a rodde, Even Jesus, our great God. Th' Egyptian Gods in Gardens grew, False were their Gods: But ours is true, From Heaven, transplanted to the bed, Of a pure Maydenhead. This is a plant which never dyes, A med'cine for all maladyes, A Tree of life, whose fruite is blisse, (Lord) let me taste of this. [20] The Habitation Man is no Microcosme, and they detract From his dimensions, who apply This narrow terme to his immensitye: Heaven, Earth, and Hell, in him are pack't: Hee's a miscellanye of goods, and evills, A temper mixte with Angells, Beasts, and Devills. Yea the immortall Deitye doth daigne, T'inhabite in a carnalle cell: So pretious gemmes in the darke center dwell, So gloomy mines fine gold retaine: But by vicissitudes, these Essences The various heart of Man wont to possesse. For God no Innemate will with Satan bee: Angells will not consorte with Beasts. If Man would pursue his best interests, What blessed seasons might Hee see? But Hee invites the Devill, and the Beast, Nor God nor Angells, will Hee lodge or feast./ [21] The Dialogue Soule Nor wealthy mines, nor mineralls I seeke: My thoughts are low, and meeke, And like a tender leeke Both white, and greene; Though like a Cedar high, Yet ever groweing by Unfain'd humility: And though I may submisse, and humble seeme, My hopes are levelld for a Diademe./ Dispayre A Diademe? Alas, a racke, or wheele, Or scourge of burning steele, Thou rather oughtst to feele, Then such a royall guerdon to expect, Which onely hath respect, To favorites elect. Thy Soveraigne Lord with pierceing thornes was crown'd And must thy temples bee with glory bound? Soule (I know) my Lord did weare a crowne of scorne, His sacred browes were torne, With points of the sharp thorne: Steele pierc'd His hands, and feet, and the tough corde The tender body gor'd, Of my immortall Lord: Into his very soule the iron went; With tortures Hee was all to pieces rente:/ Dispayre And if thy Lord such torments did endure, Wilt Thou thy self assure, To live in blisse secure: Better then him dos't Thou thy self esteeme? How cans't Thou thinke, or dreame Of any Diademe? Since that thy Lord did never crowne put on, But that of torture, and derision. Soule My Lord was mock'd, tormented, and abus'd, No suffring He refus'd, That I might bee excus'd: Hee on his blessed shoulders did sustaine The burthen of my paine, And did for mee ordaine A Crowne of glory, upon this condition, That I should seeke't by faith, and true contrition. Dispayre (Vaine Soule) that ar't but a proud puffe of breath, Destind for wrath, and death, Rather then triumphes wreath, How cans't Thou hope from Him to receive good, Since Thou, and Sinne thy broode, Are guilty of his blood: Thy hopes of Heaven are vaine, not worth a shell, Thou must resolve t'abide with mee, in Hell./ Soule Avoyde (Dispayre) unto thy realme retire, Of darknes, and of fire, I tend to a place higher: Though poore in worth, yet rich in hope I am: Love doth my heart inflame, But Faith must winne the game: A crowne of glory I looke to inherit, By heavenly mercy, not through humane merit./ [22] Vanitye When Butterflyes, and Prizes vaine I spye, In silke wormes labours clad, That a faire tincture had From silly wormes likewise: then presently, I call to mind that Beelzebub/ Prince of flyes, Who though Hee bee a God, not worth a flye, Wants not such gallant subjects, and allyes. Man gloryes in the spoyles of wormes, untill Way for the wormes bee made, By picke axe, and the spade For to spoyle him: Hee doth some creatures kill Meerely to nourish up his pride: Hee weares the sheepes cast coate: to his vaine will The Bird her plumes must yeild, the Beast his hide. Hee seekes th' Ingredients of the Phoenix's nest, To please his meanest sense, And though a competence Of some few foote of clay may serve t'invest, His carkasse yet bothe th' Indyes can't Suffice his appetite: Though Hee possest The universe Hee still would cry: I wante./ [23] The Apparition A true French story Three jocund Gallants in their golden age, Court Cock'rells, in their pucellage of witt; For yet Discretion had not bedded it, Rode to the forrest in faire equipage, Where haveing pleas'd their phantasyes at least, With chase, and quarry, They their sport surceast, And curious were to find out new delights, To cocker their fastidious appetites: But while they view'd th' unartificiall bowres, Which old Sylvanus for his Faunes and Satyres Had there erected, over cristall waters, Whose bankes were diaper'd with fragrant flowres, Their owne felicityes they call'd to mind, Which in this sonnett sweet, they thus combin'd: Behold, our youthfull yeares, With strength, and beauty crown'd, While Fortune faire appeares, And richesse doe abound: Now while the Fates permitt, We our delights pursue, And for all pleasures fitt, Our joyes wee still renue, Which on our bosomes flow, As thicke as flights of snow. But when these Yonkers finish'd had their song, The scene was chang'd, for they did there descry, Three naked fabrickes of mortality, Three horride sceletons, arm'd with sithes long, Who with sad hollow accents, did repeate This answere, to those Monsieurs Canzonett. Wee liv'd in time of yore, And were as brave as you, Enrich'd with fortunes store: But see, what wee are now: In us, see and perpend Your fraile, and wretched state; And how you must descend To the darke House of Fate, Where yee must become foode, Unto Earths footles broode. The Gallants frighted with this apparition, To holy vowes, their gamesome humours chang'd This dreadfull spectacle their minds estrang'd From secular delights, and that condition, Wherein they whilome liv'd: for Each forsooke The world, and to a cell himself betooke./ [24] The Rocke Satan rejoyc'd, when Hee had wonne False Judas, to his wicked will, And made him to betray the Virgins sonne, That so Death's Heyres the Lorde of life might kill. Nor was this wolfe content, A chosen sheepe t'have rent From this great Shepheards flocke, for Hee did watch The holy Belweather likewise to catch. This fowle seducer by weake meanes, His cursed ends sought to acquire For haveing Judas hir'd for thirty pens, To sell his Master, Hee did then conspire With two poor maydes to gaine, The chiefest of the traine: These shooke the Rocke of faith in such a guise, That Satan hop'd to have obtain'd his prize. But when the sentinel of day, Loud Chanteclere, did stretch his throte With a shrill note, the Lion ranne away, And from the liveing Rocke gush'd waters hote, Him from the guilt to wash, Of his denyall rash. Oh 'twas not the Cockes voyce, but the Lords eye, Which made S? Peter weepe so bitterly. [25] Bounty (Lord) all the praise, Which I can attribute to thee, Is like a sparke, added to the sunnes rayes, Or droppe of water, powr'd into the sea; Yet let thy glory bright, Vouchsafe t'accept of a poore widowes mite. I want the skill, To take thy latitude (oh Lord) A Jacobs staffe in this serves not my will, Though Jacobs ladder may some help afford, But by a Cross-staffe, wee May some dimensions of thy goodnes see: Thou didst (oh Lord) At first, create this fabricke great Of th' Heavens, and Elements, and by thy word Dids't cause things to their centers to retreate; The fire aloft did flame, And Earth became the basis of the Frame. In various shapes, And formes, mixte things Thou didst contrive, Which did from foure originalls elapse, In numbers infinite: Thy love did strive With wisedome, and foresight, T'ordaine thy worke for profit, and delight./ Then Thou didst make, Man, thy Vicegerent over all, Who sudainly did thy commands forsake, And from the height of happynes did fall, Ere some few houres were gone, His raigne was finished, and Hee undone. But then thy love, To us, more clearely did appeare, For by a second Eve Thou didst remove, That curse, which the first Eve brought in whilere The second Adam, on A second Tree, did us with Thee attone. No love, like this Was ever seene, or knowne before; Thou gavs't thy sonne for our iniquityes, Who with his pretious blood unlock'd Heaven doore; Hee dying on the Crosse, Made satisfaction full for Adams losse. But when our Lord, Had triumph'd over Death, and Hell, Hee to his Fathers bosome was restor'd, Where in eternall glory Hee doth dwell; Then did Hee call to mind That little flocke, which Hee had left behind. And downe He sent, The Comforter, the God of peace, That Hee might by his wise arbitrement, Us guide in all our wayes, and passages: But with His Father, Hee, Still mediates, for our indemnitye. God doth protect; While God the Sonne doth intercede; And God the Holy Ghost cheeres the Elect: (Lord) what is Man that thou shouldst thus him heede? Man is a thing of nought: Why for his safegard shoulds't thou take such thought? (Oh God) Thou ar't In bounty most superlative, Yet for thy gifts, askds't but a thankfull heart; A recompence not very hard to give, Yet many so forgett Their duetyes, that they perish in thy debt. (Oh Lord) I crave That Thou one blessing more wolds't adde Unto thy former gifts, oh let mee have A gratefull heart, then shall my heart bee glad, And in this rejoyce more, Then for all gifts which I receiv'd before. [26] The Navigation The modest sinner stood behind, Who whilome wont with amorous belgardes, To captivate each wanton mind; But now in humble sort, she earth regardes, Not dareing to lift up her eye, 'Cause shee had sinn'd against Heaven high. Her penitentiall teares did flow: Into the deepes of true repentance, shee Did launche, while dreary sighes did blow To drive her barke upon the silver lee, Shee doubled the Cape of good Hope, And mercy kenn'd from the maine toppe. Then to the God of sea, and land, Who had preserv'd her from a dismall wracke, Shee payd Her vowes, and with her hand The pretious boxe of fragrant spikenard brake, And with this unguent did besmeare, The temples of her Saviour deare./ [27] The Apologye I blesse those calmes, Which gave me leisure, For to endite these holy psalmes, In stead of songs of pleasure. I praise my God, who mee inspires With pure, and sanctify'd desires. Although my Muse, Was not so chast, As some immur'd, untouch'd Recluse, I did no paper waste, To varnish with my rymes of praise, The fame of any wanton Thais. Although I was No Rechabite, I never did dote on a glasse, Like to Anacreon light: Nor ever had I a designe, Lines to sophisticate with wine. I drinke no water (Like Cassius) Am no Apicius at a platter, Nor yet a Lessius: I eate and drinke; but not by weight, Yet am no slave to appetite. (Lord) let thy grace Turne my desires, From objects, that are vaine, and base: Fill mee with holy fires, Least I become a brutish thing Like the transform'd Assyrian King. [28] Infirmitye I want a volubility of tongue, To trafficke for applause; Although I know the lawes And rights of rhetoricke: I am not strung For sound, and musicke shrill: My tongue's a silent quill: My witt is dumbe, and doth rehearse Things by mere signes, and characters. But my defect in this mercuriall part, Doth chiefely mee afflict, When I my self addict, To praise my God, with a devoted heart: I covet not a tongue, To tune a wanton song: A tongue tipp'd with deceite, or guile, A tongue to rayle, or to revile. But such a tongue I would desire to have, As might impresse remorse, In holy Auditours, And rather cause them to lamente, then laughe: Yet alwayes would I not, Unto a tragicke note My organe sett; but would make glad (As time should serve) a spirit sad. Then since my tongue is so infirme (Oh Lord) That I cannot aspire, To bee one of thy quire, Vouchsafe those gifts unto my heart t'afford, Which may make recompence, For my tongues impotence; Then I shall praise Thee, while my will, My tongues defects shall cover still. [29] Contrition My heart is broken (oh my God) Breake mee not like a potters vessell, Bruse mee not with an iron rodde, But forme mee by thy holy Chesill, That I a statue may become, Fitt to adorne thy heavenly roome. The Figge tree yeildes a fruite that's sweet, Yet is unprofitable wood; For Sculptour's art it is unmeete, And neither serves for saint, or Roode: For Vulcan's use it is unfitt, His bellowes doe no good on it. But I that wretched Tree am, which The hunger of my Christ deceives, Hee fruite expects, but I am rich In nothing but vaine spreadeing leaves, Nor am I wood so fitt, and apt That of mee can a saint bee shap't. Yea, I am that same Figgetree vaine, Which in Christs vineyard planted was, Drest many yeares with care, and paine, Yet onely serve to fill a place: I therefore feare the axes wound, Bicause I comber but the ground. (Lord) in mee repayre (by thy grace) The image Thou dids't first create: Though Adams sinne did it deface, Yet Mine, did it more vitiate: Vouchsafe t'amend it with thy hand, Then in thy Gallr'y it may stand. [30] The Progresse Man in the wombe, is but a Zoophyte, There nourish'd like a plant: But when Hee is produc'd to the day-light, Disclos'd from that warme haunte, Hee at the honour doth arrive, To bee a creature sensitive. And Memory, with Fancye in him raigne, Till Time makes him mature. Then Reason setts her throne up in his braine, And takes the soveraigne cure Of the fraile Microcosme, an empire Which oft Commotions doe distemper. For Will seduc'd by carnall Appetite, Her dictates doth despise: Thus her prerogative she looseth quite, And her high dignityes; But divine Grace can Her, alone Restore unto the regall Throne. By whose assistance, Man acquireth power, Unto an higher pitch to clime, And to become a glorious Conquerour, Over both Death, and Time. Thus Hee, who was a Zoophyte At first, becomes an Angell bright./ [31] Neclect If Man knew his own blisse, Or all his capabilityes, Hee would not nayled bee to this low Center, Of earthly pleasures, But would put forth to sea, and boldly venture For richer treasures. Vaine Man remembers not The way to blisse./ Hee hath forgott How that the Lord of life came downe to dye, That wee might rise To live./ As if the Gospell were a lye, In sinne He lyes. Sometimes when Hee thinkes on Christs bloudy Crosse, and passion, Perhaps Hee'l give a ceremonious breath, Of aire, and griefe, But will not droppe a teare upon that death, Which gave him life. How doth our Ignorance, Make us appeare Cimmerians? Involv'd in outward and in inward shades; For wee forgett, How age by minutes growes, and how life fades, How Time doth flitte. Wee to the grave ride poste, As to some pleasant coast, Where wee to footles creatures become feasts, That dwell in tombes, Who murthers doe avenge of fowles, and beasts Upon our wombes. But if we can dispense, With brutish appetite, and sense, And momentaneous pleasures lay aside; Then wee shall rise, Unto such joyes, as never were descry'd, By eares or eyes. [32] The Treasure Hee that seekes gold, or pearle, must delve, or dive, And descend toward Hell: Thus things, for which the world doth chiefely strive, Neare Hells precincts doe dwell: But there's a gemme, and Treasure to bee found, Rather above the skyes, then under ground. Eternall Richesse, whose Possessours are, Nor prodigall, nor covetous: For though they must acquired bee by care, And toyle solicitous, Yet (being once obtain'd) they doe presente Unto the heart, a fullnes of content. But Wee, doe Indian savages excell, In absurd brutish dotage: Gold wee exchange for glasse, our Birthrights sell, Even for a messe of potage, Yea choose to forfeyte all celestiall treasure, Rather then to abandon one base pleasure. Our soules taste too much of the soyle, and caske, To please Gods palate: wee Wont to esteeme it an Egyptian taske, True Christians to bee. As if there were no Heaven, or Hell, we cry Good morow Sinne, and good night Sanctity. When I a fat Physicion doe behold, Thriveing by pockes, and fevers, Or a leane Lawyer, larded well with gold, Through sordide base endeavours I wonder not to see a Pastour meager Appeare like one, come from a winter leaguer. We corruptible carkasses regarde./ Uncertaine life, and health, Seeke chiefely to preserve: wee labour hard For transitory wealth: But the soules health, or wealth, wee least care for, As if wee could not want a Saviour. Or as our Saviour could not us want; But of necessity, Must his eternall joyes unto us graunt, Without our piety, For goods that perish, wee take onely care, Neclecting treasures, which immortall are. Vouchsafe (oh Lord) t'enrich mee with thy grace, Then I shall willingly Carnall delights, and vanityes let passe, Sell all my stocke to buy That orientall Pearle, and that same field, Wherein thy heavenly Treasure is conceald./ [33] Jordan The cruell Souldier, with his speare, Did pierce our Saviours side, Whence bloud did flow, with water cleare: Oh what a blessed Fount was here: Had this spring not bene spy'd, Even the whole world had dy'd. This was a soveraigne cordiall, Which did from death, to life recall. His heart was wounded first by love, For which caus'd him to descend From his immortall Throne above, Our humane Nature for to prove; True love did him incende, His precious bloud to spend: But by his last wound wee were heal'd; Th' assurance of our blisse it seal'd. A twofold Jordan did arise, From these two springs to cure, Our epidemicke leprosyes, And every soules infirmityes: For this same water pure, Powr'd from an holy eure, Doth cleanse a sinfull soule: but Bloud The cure must finish, and conclude./ [34] Prodigyes Wee heare of dire portents, and Prodigies, Sad meteours of bloud, and fire, The signes of heavenly ire, Forewarners of the Earths calamityes, Summons that call men in, To give account for sinne Presageing Death, and devastations To Cittyes proud, and sinfull Nations. Et penitus toto divisos orbe Brittannos.Wee, who were Sep'ratists from the whole world, Divided from the spacious maine, By Neptunes wat'ry chaine, Are now divided in our selves, and hurl'd Into a sea of dangers, Become a mocke to strangers, Who whilome were their scourge, and terrour, Such is our folly, and our errour. The petulant proud French, Th' unstedfast Scot, The Irish ever false, and bloudy; And the rude Danes study, Us utterly to ruine: 'Tis our lot To have false freinds good store, But Adversaryes more; Yea every Nation doth envuye us, Threatning to spoyle us, and destroy us. And as if the whole world could not suffice, And serve, for the production Of our destruction, Wee torne are with domesticke enemityes, Our Preists invectives preach, Strife, and dissention teach: Pulpittes, with pulpitts are at jarres: Are not these more then civill warres? Like th' Elements, before the World was made, Wee mixte are, and embroyled all, In strife unnaturall: The Anabaptist is through zeale starke mad, And though Hee fairely doth professe, The height of holynes, Religion's very soule hee quittes, For too much heate hath craz'd his wittes. His noddle brings new Antichrists to light, The purple Babylonian whore, Is spoken of no more, As if shee were become a Convertite; Our rev'rent mitered Preists Are now termd Anti-christs As if they were Beasts more profane, Than that upon the Vaticane. A Clergy proud, and too licentious, Ever more ready tithes to gather, Then to preach truths, and rather Conformable, then conscientious, Neclecting for to give Bread truely nutritive To hungry soules, may chiefely owne The troubles of this realme, and crowne. I thirst, and daily pray for publicke peace, But if it bee displeas'd Heavens will, That Earth shall drinke bloud still And that our sorowes shall not yet surcease, Grant (Lord) that I may bee Ever at peace, with thee: So I no Prodigyes shall feare, Though Death himself like one appeare. [35] Infinitenes (Lord) Hee, who goes about to find Thy pow'r, and bounds would to it sett, As soone may manacle the winde, Or aire emprison in a nette, Yea Hee as soone may with one spanne, Measure the largest Ocean. But when I of thy beauty muse, Whose onely vision to us shall, Divine beatitude infuse, I into greater wonder fall, And count it even the worst of crimes, T' admire the beautyes of the times. Nor doth thy wisedome lesse mee take, When I behold the order rare, Of things, which thine owne hand did make: Even from the gloworme, to the starre, From th' Angell bright, to the darke clod, Thy wisedome doth extend (oh God) But when thy justice (I behold) I am forc'd to admire, and feare, Th' examples bee so manifold, Of thy great judgements every where: As well in these; as essence, Thou, Incorruptible ar't (I know) While I a corruptible wretch, My Judge incorruptible view, Deepe sighes I am compell'd to fetch; Such sorowes doe my sinnes pursue: Yet I find comfort, when I see, My Saviour my Judge shall bee. Even like Ezekiels dry'd bones, I am reviv'd, and in my mind, Find new, and cheerefull motions, (Lord) when I see thy mercyes kind Which doe in number, farre surmount All arithmeticall account. T'was not impossible (oh Lord) To count thy wounds, not onely those Wherewith thy hands, and feet were gor'd, But such as scourges did impose, Or those which by the crowne of thorne, Were fix'd on Thee, in cruell scorne. But How thy sorowes did abound, Beyond humane capacitye; No griefe like thine was ever found: Thy whole life was an Agonye: Yet t'was not strange, thou dids't sweat blood, Since such a burthen did thee loade. For both Heavens wrath, and the worlds sinne, Thou meekely, didst vouchsafe to beare: Millions of Sampsons, had not bin Sufficient, such a weight to reare: But at thy death, the Sunne puttes on Blacke robes, while th' Elements did grone. Never was such an obite kept, For at thy death, the Dead did rise, (Who in the graves long time had slept) To celebrate thine Obsequyes: Angells, and Devills, mourn'd to see The Lord of life, dye on a tree. The symptomes of thy passion (Lord) Remembrancers are of thy love, Who with thy bloud mads't an accord, For sinners, in the Heavens above: Numbers confine thy suffrings might, But (Lord) thy love is infinite. An Angell, with a reede of gold, Did measure new Jerusalem; But Angells tongues cannot unfold Thy love, and mercy: To mete them It passeth geometricke skill, For they both Heaven, and earth doe fill. Oh give me leave for to adore, Thy wisedome, Justice, strength, and beauty, Rich in desires I am, though poore, In the performance of my duety, Let not thy love, my love despise, But make my heart, thy sacrifice. [36] The Descension (Lord) in my Creede I find it not, That Thou dids't downe to Limbo goe: The Scripture mentions no such grotte, Though thy descent to Hell's a knot, Which many labour to undoe: But I see no necessity at all, That Thou so farre, shoulds't from thy center fall. Yea from thy mouth I have't in briefe, That Thou to Paradise didst clime; For it can't enter my beliefe, Thou wouldst deceive the Godly Thiefe, And faile to meete him, at the time, And place prefix'd: Who fully was possest, That His soule, should with thine, that day find rest. But though Thou dids't no jorney take, Into that darke infernall sphere, Yet thou excursions wont'st to make, Even to the gates of that foule lake; For while my soule did wander there, Thou metts't it (Lord) and (through thy benigne grace) Dids't it reduce unto a better place./ [37] Unconstancye Sometimes I am transfigur'd to a saint, And seeme like those who mett upon Mount Tabor; And then againe My Soule through feare wax'd faint, Doth in the Valley of Gehennon labour: Sometimes I mount like fire, or aire; Then petrify'd by cold dispaire, I to the center sinke, And my self thinke, At the pittes brinke./ (Lord) ballance mee with discreete moderation, But from my heeles the clogges of Sinne untye, Least that I fall too low, through desperation, Nor through presumption, let mee soare too high: But let thy Grace teach mee to acte, And to observe a middle tract: Hee that on waxen plumes, To rise presumes, Himself consumes. [38] Devotion While that my knees doe bowe unto my God, And my officious tongue doth pray, My heart seduced by some fancyes odde, Doth wander quite another way: (Lord) chaine my heart, with feare, and love, That it may not at randon rove: Thy essence seemes triangular (oh God) And such the cell is of my heart: Vouchsafe therein t'establish thine abode, And let thy vertue fill each part, Let not my Sinne, keepe Thee aloofe, But daigne to dwell beneath my roofe. I bowe my knees, erect mine hands, and eyes To Thee; but These (without an heart) Are but a vaine unseason'd sacrifice; Like that, which made the Ethnickes start, Who in their profane victimes fear'd, Ill lucke, when there no heart appeared. [39] The Bottle Thou bears't the Bottle, I the Bagge (oh Lord) Which daily I doe carry at my backe, So stuff'd with sinne, that ready 'tis to cracke: I have no unfain'd Nectar for thy Gourde, Mine eyes will no such precious drinke afford: Yet both my heart, and eyes, are Deserts dry, Even Lybian sands, where Serpents crawle and fly. Yea the two extreme Zones tuke up my heart, For unto good, as cold as ice, I am; But unto evill, like an Ætna flame: I paralyticall seeme in each part, One utterly depriv'd of strength, and art, When I should execute my Masters will, But active am as fire, t'accomplish ill. I beare the Bagge like Judas: (Lord) doe Thou, From this unwieldye burthen mee dismisse, And this bagge emptye, which so heavy is: Then shall my teares into thy Bottle flow; Not onely teares, which doe from sorow grow, But cooler droppes, which doe from joy distill, And to the brimme, these shall thy Bottle fill./ [40] The Deliverance One blindfold went, upon the narrow ridge, Of a steepe bridge, Which with an arched bitte, did curbe, and chappe A fomeing flood: Hee haveing pass'd along, free from mishap, Threw of his hood, And lookeing on the danger Hee had scap'et, With infinite amazement Hee was rap't: Then conscious of that Providence sublime, Which at that time, Had him preserved from the jawes of Hell, Immediately, In humble sort, upon his knees Hee fell, And zealously, No dry devotions did to him forth powre, Who from those waters deepe, did him secure. [41] The Triumphe The King of Heaven, the Conquerour Of Earth, and Hell, mounts on An Asse, which never did before, Weare bridle, or caparison: For t'was unmeete Man should bestride, That Beast, on which the Lord did ride. The way, where this yong steede did sett His humble steps, with palmes was crown'd And least the stones should hurt his feet, Men threw their garments on the ground; The Rider they did honour so, They could have throwne themselves there too. The very word, Hosannah, was Such an applause, and acclamation, That it alone, did farre surpasse A Panegyricall Oration: The Romane Triumphes, were to this, Mere puppet playes, and mummeryes. No ostentation here was seene, But glory pure, unmix'd with pride, Humility, and worth serene, In heavenly bonds, together ty'd: Why should thy Daughter faire (oh Sion) Feare this approche of Judahs Lion? Who, though Hee could have mannaged, Even th' Elephant, without a bitt, Or made Rhinoceros his steed, Yet on an Asses colt would sitt: 'Till then, and since, none ere did know, Such supreme glory sitt so low. No spoyles of Monarchyes undone, Were here before him carryed, No captive Kings him waited on, Admired for their exoticke weede: No silver Donative was strew'd, To please the greedy multitude. These were resultes of glory vaine, Mere pompous showes, of humane pride, This victour did such toyes disdaine, Hee did his spoiles, and captives hide, And all those spectacles, which might, Beholders to applause invite. Had Hee his spoiles and captives shew'd, Those Crownes, and Garlands brought to sight, Which to his Victorye accrew'd, Spectatours had bene ravish'd quite, And would have wondered for to see, Captivity a Captive bee. But if Hee had expos'd to view, Those Kings of Darknes, and of Sinne, Which Hee did utterly subdue, A stranger spectacle t'had bin; That had with terrour men amazed, As well as admiration caus'd. But though no sullen Kings forlorne, Or spoiles of pillag'd empires brave, Appear'd, his triumph to adorne, Yet Hee a Congiarye gave, Which did their Donatives excell As farre, as highest Heaven doth Hell./ For Hee salvation did disperse, To all, that would in him beleeve: The Gentile wilde, and Jew perverse, Admitted were it to receive: But many were so blind, and cold, That they despis'd this proffer'd gold. [42] The Extremes When I (at Rome) beheld poore people fall, Before brasse, stone, and paper painted, Yea every metall, and materiall, That canonized was, and Saynted; I wonder'd then, where the least sense did lye, Or in the Idoll, or the Votarye. But I (at home) doe more admire, while they Who are instructed oft, and told To whom, and how, they daily ought to pray, Are in devotion so cold: And then, I thinke, that our neclects at home, May well those follyes match, I saw at Rome./ Where though they doe no frankinceense consume, Beneath the boughes of each greene Tree, Yet rotten wood, they oftentimes perfume, And of their od'rous smoke are free To those dumbe Gods, whom they should rather throwe Into the fire, then smoke on them bestowe. While on their Ignorance I doe reflect, And their absurdnes in devotions, I the Almighty pray, them to direct, With light, and better motions: Yea that Hee would give us devotion true, And with more heavenly notions them endue. [43] The Feast (Yee divine Epicures) whom sacred thirst Of high Beatitude, doth move, T'approche this Table; Here drinke, till yee burst Into a flood of teares, and love: That heavenly diet, of which Greece did fable, By Grace, is truely serv'd in to this Table. All well prepared Appetites, may here Take diet, whose concoction breedes Eternall Life, this is that mysticke cheere, Which both the soule, and body feedes: Apples of life, compared with this foode, Appeare not halfe so pleasant, or so good. With Nectar, and Ambrosia, let the Greekes Feast their supposititious Jove: (Egypt) adore thy Garlicke, and thy leekes, Which may our scorne, not envuye prove. Our foode not onely endles life doth give, But also makes the dead to rise, and live./ [44] Weakenes (Oh Lord) how can I observe thy commands, Since I have neither heart, nor hands, I want both eares, and eyes: The facultyes, Of my decrepite soule, are so decayd, That they can lend my will no ayde: For those things, I would doe, I can't reach too: So infirme am I, and so overlayd. Hereditary sinne stickes in my bones, From many generations; The Parents of us all Were sensuall, And fix'd on us, through their intemperance, That epidemicall disease, Which none can cure, but Hee, Who on a Tree Expir'd: Thus Life with Death in race aggrees. The crosse was/the tree of life/ &amp; the tree of the/forbidden fruite,/the tree of death/ (Lord) even thine owne Disciples, who beheld Thy great miracles, and were fill'd With thy instructions, they, Oft went astray: Thy Parables, they did not understand, And though by power from thy hand, They went to cast out Devills, And heal all evills, Yet alwayes could not performe thy command. Though in their sight, Thou, not with many dishes, But a few loaves, and fewer fishes, Didst many thousands feede, Yet want of bread, Did them perplexe, bicause they faith did want: Though They, with Thee were conversant; Infants to Thee presented, Them discontented, Though Thou to such alone, thy realme dos't graunt. On land, They Thee but a meere Man esteem'd; At sea, They Thee a spirit deem'd: They wanted faith t'espy Thy Deitye, By sea or land; though Thou, by sea, and land, Thy Godhead shewd'st: yea though thy hand By wonders did out acte, Eves whole extracte, Yet They, Thee a mere Prophet understand. Yea, one of those, who at thy Table fed, Who tooke from thee that mysticke bread, Which being taken right, Gives life, and light: Even Hee, thy life betrayd, with a light kisse, Unto thy cruell enemyes, Hee sold (for thirty pence) The quintessence Of life, and the Elixir of true blisse. How then thy Flocke was scatter'd, on each hand, Like winde-driven dust, or flyeing Sand: Yea, that stout Champion, (Who stood upon His valour most) most faintly thee deny'd: A silly Mayde his weakenes try'd, Made him to curse, and sweare, And shrinke for feare; His Faith the touch, and tryall would not bide. I feare, and wonder, when I doe behold, These fayleings in thy chosen fold, Therefore at thy feet low, My self I throwe: Begging that I may bee thought acceptable, To gather crummes beneath thy Table; For to drinke of thy cup, I dare not hope, Bicause I am unworthy, and unable./ [45] The Lamentation The Heavens did mourne: The windes did grinne: These vapours blacke, Their rise did make, From the vast Ocean of our sinne: For from our crimes, Proceedes th' ill weather of the times. No humide Planets mett together, In a moist signe: No wat'ry Trine, Hath bene the cause of our ill weather: Planets below, Have made the higher cloudes to flow. Plenty from these was wont to droppe, But now they lowre, As if their power, Intended famine, not a croppe: Thus our excesse, Our blessings turnes to our distresse. The noyse of Musicke, and of laughter, In our feasts heard, Were omens fear'd: For mischiefes needes must follow after; Sinne the way leades, And in her footsteps vengeance treades. The Heavens are our Remembrancers, And plainly showe, What wee should doe, By their uncessant floods of teares: But wee are flint, And from their Item's, take no hint. (Oh Thou) who from th' obdurate stone, Mads't waters rush, And fountaines gush, A greater miracle worke on Hearts, that may vaunt, For hardnes, with the Adamant. [46] Sanctification What medlye Linsy wolsye stuffe Am I made of? I had bene good, and ill enough, If my desires had bene fulfill'd: But God repell'd The evill, and the good witheld. My heart Thebaicke marble is, Spotted like this, With lusts, and divers vanityes: All colours, but the virgin white, Are there in sight, Yet 'tis no object of delight. My God disdaines in it to dwell, 'Cause 'tis a cell, As darke as an Abysse, or Hell, And when on it I doe reflect, I in't detect Nothing but folly, and defect. Lord dippe me in the purple flood, Of thine own blood; Then shall my ill bee turn'd to good, And I seeme stuffe, though not so fine Thy vest to line, Yet, for thy pantoffles divine: And let my heart of spotted stone, By lotion, In rivers of thy Passion, Turne white: so shalt thou banish quite, Hardnes, and night, And to dwell there, Thou shalt delight. [47] The Pedigree While I did narrowly investigate, The race, and linage of my sinnes, I found that sinne, and I were twinnes, Begotten, and brought forth, at the same date Of time, and so by consequence, Subject unto the selfsame influence. Destin'd to live, and dye together: Then I blush'd for shame, and could have cry'd, Because I was so closely ty'd, To such an ougly Ethiopian: But most it did afflict my heart, 'Cause t'was ordain'd, that wee must never part. I wish'd her not my sister, but my wife, For then I could have found a course, To bee reliev'd by a divorce, And to lay downe this burthen of my life: But when more strictly I look'd in, Reflecting on my self, as well as sinne, I found, that wee two were together knitte, More neare, then any Twinnes can bee Ally'd; at least by a degree: For wee bothe made but one Hermaphrodite; This double shape, and forme I hated, Which by figge leaves could not bee palliated. While I my monstrous feature did deteste, I tooke in hand a holy glasse, Therein for to reviewe my face, Bicause I knew, this Mirroir well exprest, The just proportion of each line: No glasse was ever seene so true, so fine. And though this Glasse did to me represente Mine owne deformityes, yet there A ray of beauty did appeare, The ruine of a feature excellent: This spectacle my spirits sad Refresh'd, and did some consolation adde. And while I still did with this glasse advise, More comfort to me did accrewe, For it a heavenly forme did shew, Though much defac'd by carnall vanityes, Encourag'd by this good successe, I still did hope to make my sorowes lesse. And makeing still inquirye in this Glasse, By humble speculation, I Found out a present remedy, For all deformityes, which did deface My native shape, and by what art I might a Monster to a saint convert. It shewd how I a liveing well might find, Which from five conduits did cast forth, Pure crimson streames, of soveraigne worth, And here to bathe my self I was injoyn'd, And then these springs should mee endue, With an angelicke shape, and heavenly hue. [48] Peace (Peace) whether ar't thou fled? Thy native soyle Is Christendome: Into what unknowne Ile Ar't Thou retir'd from us? What made thee to estrange thy self from home? Turne exile thus: Salem, lyes in her ruines buryed, And yeldes no place, For Thee to rest thy head, 'Cause Shee refus'd t'afford A place of rest, (long since) unto his grace, Who is thy Lord. Oh whether ar't thou fled? To Scythian snowes Or lybian Sands, Wher fiery Phoebus glowes, And pois'nous serpents crawle: How have our sinnes, forc'd Thee to seeke for lands Unhospitall? Oh whether ar't thou fled? What ha'st thou quite Left us; And ar't Turn'd Nunne, or Anchorite: Thy Lord did Thee ordaine With us t'abide, although Hee did depart: Oh turne againe. Our Arke, hath long enough bin tost upon The rageing billowes, Of dire dissention, Which makes us to lament, And hang our harps, and hearts upon the willowes, Of discontent. Thou, Who dids't from Mount Olivet ascend, And like a Larke Didst soare; then downe didst send Thy Spirit from above; Now with an olive branch, unto our Arke, Send backe this Dove. [49] The Nosegay If I could weepe my self into a spring, Or a perpetuall current: then This Metamorphosis might seeme a thing Of merit, in the eyes of Men: But what requitall can this bee, To him, that did weepe blood for me? Could I for penitentiall sigheings, vye With the whole compasse, some might guesse, That my contrition was a motive high, To melt an heart, even mercyles. But what requitall can this bee, To him that sigh'd his last for mee? What if I should to death my self expose? And feele a torture in each nerve: Yet all these torments in one death must close, And what by it could I deserve From him, who dyeing once, did mee From millions of deaths sett free? Lord since by acte I can effect no good, Nor yet by suffreing, lend Thou mee, The flowers of thy Passion, strip'd with blood, Which I will render unto Thee, Dew'd with my teares, hopeing by these, (Though not to merite) yet t'appease. [50] The Pilgrimage Errours of youth How did my sorowes mount above My hopes, and threate Me to defeate, While I did wander in a grove, Through crooked pathes of doubts, and feares, Where little light of joy appeares. On neither hand I could descry, A beacon bright, To sett mee right, No pillar, or dumbe Mercury, Appear'd to answere my desires: I nothing saw but foolish fires. Sometimes I thought to rest, and stay, Conceiveing it, Better to sitt, Then more and more to goe astray: But then I found, that I could have, No resting place, but in the grave. Fortune. While thus perplex'd I did abide, A beauto'us Dame, Unto mee came, And profferd for to bee my guide, Then I, who long since wont t'admire, The fairest objects of desire, Her proffer gladly did embrace, Not doting on, Proportion, Or any beauty in her face, But hopeing that her prudencye, Should sett mee right, that went awrye. Shee with Her cinque foyl'd Lilly prest, my rougher hand, And did command, I should chase terrours from my brest, For shee would mee conduct in peace, Unto a place of joy, and ease. Shee led, I followed close behind, But ere wee had Three furlongs made. I did perceive my guide was blind, Deepe holes, steepe Hills, and pathwayes glaz'd With slipp'ry ice, made mee amaz'd. Then I conceiv'd it better farre, To wander still, At mine owne will, Then follow such an errant starre, Wherefore I presently withdrew, And bade my leader blind adieu. Pleasure. I had no sooner taken leave, When t'was my fate, To meete a Mate, Whose lookes seem'd destin'd to deceive, Her face, her dresse, might even have mov'd A second Joseph to have lov'd. Her hayres, in a disorderd order, Disheveld hung, With tresses long. Her temples circled in a border, Of rubyes, pearles, and emraulds greene, Declar'd her to be beautyes Queene. Her mantel breath'd Arabian fumes, And seemd t'envuy, The precious dye Of thee, immortall Pheenix's plumes: Shee woo'd mee to submit to her, And then I should no longer erre. Then shee mee to a mountaine led, Where flowers grew, Of every hue, And Trees of pleasure their armes spred, Where did melodious Birds rejoyce Admir'd for colour, and for voyce. This Hill appear'd so exquisite, That now I thought, I had found out, The very palace of delight. Now no more errours did I feare, Bicause I thought my rest was neare. With mickle joy I did ascend, This pleasant Mount, And did account, I was come to my journeys end; But horride spectacles did then Make mee myself wish backe age'n. For the swolne Toade, and th' hisseing Snake, With speckled hides, Upon all sides Did crawle, and their vagaryes make, Who did their livide poyson spue, Upon all flowers which there grew. These objects caus'd mee to make halte, While this coy Dame, Cry'd fye for shame, And did my lacke of courage fault: Shee drew mee on, but then a cry Did warne mee to returne, or dye. I heard one cry: returne, returne: If you proceede, You are but dead: Then I beheld the mountaine burne: For Ætna like, it fire did vomite, And flames of sulphur issu'd from it. Then I, with terrour sore aga'st, My Guide forsooke, No leave I tooke: But downe the mountaines side fled fast: With more haste, then I did ascend For feare did much my speed amend. Knowledge. When I had left this horride place, I chanc'd to meete A Lady sweet, Of sober garbe, and comely grace, Her eyes were perspicills to find, The hidden beautyes of her mind. No Torce of flowres, or precious stones, Did decke her browes, With glorious showes: Her beauty needed no additions, Nor did her will of things approve, That rather tempte to lust, then love. She proffered my course to steere, But I, as one, Who had misdone, Through my credulity, did feare To bring my self to worse estate, Then I had rashly done of late. But then my Genius prompted mee, not to be nice, But take advice From Her: then wee did soone aggree, And shee did mee t'a garden guide, Where Art, and Nature mastr'yes try'd./ All fruites, and flowers there did grow, Here birds did warble; And polish'd marble, Did streames from his hard intrayles throwe, Which did perpetually gush, And made the very cristall blush. Here statues prais'd the Sculptour's art, And like things stood, Of flesh and blood: Onely the touch serv'd to convert, Deceiv'd spectatours, who did guesse, That these were liveing substances. While I admired these delights, Which seem'd design'd, To take the mind, As well as sense: the Dame m'invites To plucke fine flowres, and fruite to taste; Whose gentle offer I embrac'd. But when I had well satisfy'd, My appetite, And curious sight; The Dame did to a porte mee guide, Grace./ And here another Lady was, Mee to conduct to a new place. It to my mind was troublesome, To leave so soone, This station, Which I thought an Elysium: But yet I was resolv'd t'obey, Bicause I could not well say nay. Nor did th' aspect of this last Dame, lesse good foreshew, Then I earst knew; With modesty her cheekes did flame, Devotion in her eyes did blase: The mappe of heaven was in her face. Her faire diportment did mee winne, And her sweet mine, Which was divine, And seem'd an antidote 'gainst sinne: For it such pow'rfull rayes did cast, As might have made a Tarquine, chast. I followd Her, and shee mee leades, into a vale, unhospitall: Where thorny shrubbes uprear'd their heads, And prickeing briers did abound, Which did my feet and ankles wound. While that these difficultyes hard, Procur'd my smart, And vex'd my heart. The Lady no good Counsell spar'd, But still repayr'd my courage weake, Which ready was to faile, and breake. To patience shee did mee incite, And to beare out, With a mind stout, This brunt displeasant; that I might Arrive soone at a place of rest, Where I should dwell for ever blest. Then I my spirits recollected, And in my sorow, Did comfort borow, From future joyes, which I expected; My tedious toyle I did subdue, Bicause my hopes had blisse in view. When I had pass'd this dreary vale, My self I found, On better ground, And in aire that was cordiall; Fresh spirits here did in mee breathe, My former life was but a death. All things seemd here compos'd, and sett To please a mind, From sinne refind: Order, and beauty here were mett, No sullen cloude envuy'd the day, No blustring windes their prankes did play. Here was such fullnes of delight, That forepast joyes, I counted toyes. And former labours forgott quite; Here of my God I did request, To sett up my repose, and rest. [51] The Transmutation I lately in a garden GREWE, But was nor Charity, nor REWE, But rather an unhappy EWE. Then Heaven upon my branches FROWND, And dangers mee environ'd ROWND, For I no fruite of goodnes OWND. Then I was like a wither'd BRAKE, Which to'st is underneath the RAKE, My sappe consum'd, my heart did AKE. My Conscience did mee bite, and CLAWE, I feard the rigour of the LAWE, And of Gods anger stood in AWE. I humbly then besought his GRACE, That Hee would change my name and RACE, Bicause I was not worth an ACE. My brest then felt a blessed SPARKE, And I transplanted to a PARKE, Became an Oke to build Gods ARKE. [52] The Burthen While on my self I doe reflect, I spy a brittle House of clay, With many imperfections deck't, Which while I labour to correct, To these I new additions lay: So fraile, so vaine am I, in each respect: (Oh God) teach mee thy way. I beare a Burthen on my backe, And lay it downe to lessen it, Bicause it makes my shoulders cracke; But I so much discretion lacke, Am so devoyde of sense, and witt, That I more weight still on the same doe packe: (Oh God) my Sinne remitt. Thou dos't (oh Lord) poore Soules invite, That are surcharg'd with burthens great, To seeke for succour, from thy might, Who wilt their heavy loades make light: My soule doth therefore Thee intreate, That Thou woulds't please to ease me of my weight; (Lord) doe mee not forgett. [53] Ostentation The world Nobility doth measure, By acres, or by bagges of treasure: And some with more apparent sense, Doe it compute by long descents; Like Adams sinne, they it confine To a continu'd race, or line: Of Vertou's habites none doth notice take; Of piety no more esteeme they make, Then of an old, unusefull Almanacke. When Romane Vertue bare the bell, And did bothe East, and West compell, To buckle to her Eagles proud, Then Gentr'y did arise from bloud; Not from bloud, which becomes combust, Through extreme surfeting, and lust, And is confin'd to veynes, and arteryes: For from such bloud no Gentry can arise, But somwhat hidde in a gentile disguise. Then Vertue, which was most regarded, With marble statues was rewarded, Whose strong composure did sett forth, The solidenes of their true worth: But an Escocheon gay displayes, The colour'd vertue of these dayes: Concerning feild, and charge they much inlarge, Yet few or none his foe in feild dare charge, A Carpet Knight may well weare such a targe. Like Siserah's spoyles, their fine coates bee all Mere things of fancy, nothing reall, Bicause the Bearers are not brave, And no heroicke endowments have: For Vertue now may bee ingro'st, Among antiquityes quite lost, Who fled to Heaven, when Earth became unkind, But in her flight, shee left her coate behind, Which upstart Gentry did by fortune find. [54] The Race This life is an Olympicke Game, a Race, Wherein the Victours shall bee crown'd, With liveing bayes; which Time cannot deface: But many obstacles abound, Us to impeach, and stoppe us in our pace; For wee runne on such unev'n ground, That they who are most sure of foote, and strong, Doe trippe, and fall seven times a day. And wee are prone to linger, and goe wrong: Besides, The World casts in our way Apples of gold, for which our palates long, Yet these no nutriment convey To us, seemeing faire, onely to the eye, Like those which fond Eve did presente Unto uxorious Adam, who thereby, A curse on us his children sent. Some in the trenches fall of luxury, Hoodwink'd by lust incontinent: The Devill in the eyes of some throwes dust; Plants engines, settes his nettes, and snares, To catch the eye, the Eare, the touch, the gust: Delves pittes of pleasures, and of cares; For to entrappe the Wicked, and the Just No toyle no trickes no time He spares. At morne, at even, at midday, and midnight, For youth, old Age, and Mans estate, Hee layes what trappes Hee thinkes most requisite, And for each temper hath a bayte, (Oh Thou) who a'rt the Guide, the Way, the Light, And to eternall life the Gate, In this Race by thy Grace let mee proceede, And let thy merit Crowne my want of speede. [55] Vivacitye When Phoebus is ascendent in the morne, With the old Archer, or cold Capricorne, The world remaines forlorne: The Birds, are then as silent as the Trees, Devested of their sommer liveryes, And clad in mossy freeze. So when thy Spirit (Lord) is from mee fled, I am a body without heart, or head, Even but a masse of lead. But when this blessed breath doth mee inspire, I loathe the center, as a lumpe of mire, And mount like active fire. Then I ascende with wings of zealous heate, Throweing my self before thy mercy seate, Fraught with devotion great. And ravish'd to this heavenly height, I can Neclect the frownes, of supercilious Man, Count richesse drosse, and branne: Pleasure but dyrte: Honour a foolish fire: And strength a property for Brutes t'admire: Beauty a fraile attire. Nor am I cur'd in my desires alone, But in my feares, not dreadeing any stone, Which may at mee bee throwne: For Death I thinke to life a portall is, And sicknes but a ready way to this, And woe a seale to blisse. [56] Hardnes Th' obdurate Adamant disdaines to feele The hardest Chesills edge; Submitting neither unto stone, nor steele; Yet many doe alleadge, That the warme bloud of Goates, hath power on This unrelenting stone: But for the bloud of an unspotted Lambe, I humbly will entreate, A hard, and refractory heart to tame, Made of obdurate Jeate: For this doth take away all hardnes quite, And changeth black to white. Droppes, by their frequent distillation, Doe pretty cesternes make, In hardest flints': (Oh Thou) the cornerstone, Vouchsafe my teares to take, Into thy bosome, where they may impresse, A sense of my distresse. Oh let those liquid rubyes, trickleing from The Cinque ports of thy wounds, Make my hard contumacious heart become, Like overflowed grounds: Then floods of penitentiall teares I'le bring, T'increase thy mercyes spring. [57] Intemperance Let them, who doe attempt both day and night, To sacke the fort of reason, Perverting Natures lawes, and order quite, Misuseing Time, and season, Ballance the jeopardy, and the delight, Resulteing from their treason, Whereby they doe disthrone rebell'ously, The Soules high hegemonicke faculty, And doe the image of their God transmute, Into that of a brute. God hath given Man the rule, and soveraignty, Over both Fowles, and beasts: But Hee, as weary of his dignity, Desertes his interests, Quittes both his empire, and his Majesty, And with their formes invests Himself: and madly personates those creatures, Of brutish sense, and worst proportion'd features; As if his life were nothing els at all, But a long Carnevalle, A season of disguise, and as if God Did love a Masquerade, Or did delight in shapes, and postures odde, More than devotion sad, Or in Lymphaticke braines to make abode, And be with Orgyes mad Ador'd:/ (Oh Thou) who didst turne water cleare, Into most gen'rous wine, And by this miracle, didst make t'appeare, Thy essence was divine Teach mee t'accomplish (by the Spirit deare) A miracle like thine; That I may turne sweet wine to brinish teares, My looser sonnetts, into holy verse: And while I thus turne wine to Holy water, I shall praise my Creatour. [58] The Combate The World's a spacious Amphitheater, And wee are slaves each one: The sinne of our first Parents, did conferre This sad condition On us: and wee are all ingag'd To combate with wild Beasts, inrag'd: Such as prodigious Affrica doth thrust Upon the world: th' effects Of flames unlawfull, and promisco'us lust, Which divers kinds connects, Upon the bankes of some blacke lake, Where each his thirst, and lust doth slake. Against such Monsters wee must fight it out, Wild Beasts more furious, Then those with which S? Paule th' Apostle fought (Long since) at Ephesus: No Missions wee can here procure, The combate must to th' outrance dure. A serpent old fraught with invet'rate hate, Assayles us night and day: But wee an Holy Dove must imprecate, T'assist us in this fray: If we desist, wee are subdu'd; Death onely must the strife conclude. [59] The Echo Telle me (my Soule) how doth thy comfort flow? Ech. Low What thoughts dos't Thou retaine of Melancholy? E. Holy What made thine holy sorow thus to rise? E. eyes What object did thine eyes to thee designe? E. Sinne What made thee sinne, and thus thy God incense? E. Sense What punishment thy great offence succedeth? E. Death Cans't Thou for death find any remedye? E. I. Where growes this blessed Balme of sanctimony? E. On high Then seeke thy God with a pure holy will. E. I will And Thou shalt find that cure which Thou desirest. E. I rest./ [60] Moderation Arts are th' Egyptian Handmaydes, to the Queene Of sciences: Moses the chiefe of Prophets, and of Men, Did these possesse: Our moderation must give these esteeme, But if wee trye, (Like Icarus) to flye a pitch extreme, And over high, Neclecting Her, who is their soveraigne just, Then ten to one, While to our waxen wings wee vainly trust, Wee are undone. Concerning creatures Arts enquiryes hold, And labour much, In secundary causes; but this gold, Will not hold touch: The circuite of the Primum Mobile Must not confine Our spirits, which accommodated bee, For things divine: Nor here must wee confide in soareing plumes, But humbly rise: For while some one on his owne strength presumes, And too high flyes, He dazled falls, and tumbles to the center, With members crack't, Because Hee was too rash, in his adventure: A middle tract Must bee observ'd, by every pious heart, Who find the port, While they their course shape by the holy Chart, In pious sort. [61] The Prodigall Disrob'd by Sinne, expos'd to the cold aire, Of dire dispaire, I sighe I grone: Famish'd for want of heav'nly sustenance, My spirit faints, And is nigh gone. My time, my prime, and patrimonye I, Have made to flye, In forraine lands: Lands farre remote from new Jerusalem, Or Bethleem, On cursed bands Of Ruffians, Baudes, and whores: These Ruffians dire, Were wrath, and ire, These baudes, and whores, Were Riote, Pride, Concupiscence, and Lust, And these have thrust Mee, out at doores: Nothing but Want, and Shame, is left behind: No hope I find, To ease my mind: How I desir'd to feede on those coarse huskes, Which t'wixt their tuskes, The swine did grinde: But none vouchsaf'd to give, or let mee taste Of this repast, 'Cause I had bin Both to my God, and to my self unkind, And had declin'd, To extreme sinne. Then g'an I of my Fathers House to thinke, Where meate, and drinke, Did much abound: His hired servants I to mind did call, Replenish'd all, With diet sound: Then did I say, I will arise, and goe My Father to, And thus make mone: 'Gains't Heaven, and before Thee, I have transgrest, And merite least, The name of sonne: Account mee but among Thy servants hir'd; This I desir'd, And forward pass'd. But when my Father mee farre of descry'd, Himself Hee ply'd, And made great haste: On mee (poore soule) Hee sweet compassion had, As one full glad, My necke Hee prest With his embraces deare, and kiss'd my cheeke, With love full meeke, While I confest My sinne: then Hee for the best robe did call, And therewithall, Did mee invest: A ring upon my hand Hee did impose, And with new shoes, My feet Hee drest: Hee caus'd them to prepare the fatted calfe, In my behalfe, And sayd, let's feede, Rejoyce, and merry bee, for this my Sonne, Who was undone, And given for dead. Is now alive./ Thus my Indulgent sire, With love entire, Tooke mee ag'en. And Heaven alone, those inward joyes can shew, In figures true, Which I felt then./ [62] The Harpe Some may occasion snatch to carpe, Sayeing that I have sung to Nero's Harpe, And therefore am for Davids most unfitt, Which piety requires, as well as witt: But thus, I my defence prepare, Sheweing how I have travell'd farre, And by the streames of Babylon have sate, Where I deplor'd my sad, and wretched state; Upon a willow there I hung That Harp, to which I whilome sung: This Tree, which neither blossomes yeldes, nor fruite, Did with this instrument unhappy sute: There let it hang, consume, and rotte Since I a better Harpe have gott, Which doth in worth as farre surpasse the other, As Abel in devotion, did his brother. [63] The Mistake Wee blame the times, But doe not on our selves reflect, To view our crimes, And Sinne the chiefest architect Of our disasters. Our optickes tend to distances, And wee are Masters, Which things at home doe not redresse; But all our losses, Unto our neihboures wee impute, Although our crosses, Wee daily by our sinnes recrute: If Each would seeke himself t'amend, How soone our miseryes should end./ [64] The Terrours T'was time to rise, My Saviour knock't, But I was rock't Asleepe, by lusts, and vanityes: And when I wak'd, My self I found, Environ'd round By perills, which my vitalls shak'd: An angry God I saw above, Whose hand did move A flameing sword, and burning rodde: On my right side, Death I beheld, Whose hand did wield A dart, ne're flyeing short, or wide: But on my left, Sinnes thronging stood, Like a thicke wood, Which more then death my heart did cleft: But underneath, Hell I espyd, Yawneing full wide, More terrible then Sinne, or Death./ Like Balthasar (When Hee beheld His ruine spelld Upon the wall) so did I fare, My Jesu saw Mee sore agast, Then Hee in haste, Did from these terrours mee withdraw./ [65] The Tempest The fraile Carine of my distemperd soule, Did on the billowes rowle, Of this tempesto'us World: The rageing gusts Of Passions, and lusts, Did from all quarters blow: The helme was lost: Never was ship so tost: The Maine mast strayn'd, and ready was to fall, So was misne Mast and all: The tackleing crack'd, like rotten threed, or strawes, And the vast deepes wide jawes, Each minute, threaten'd to involve this barke, Within their bowells darke: Then (like the Galileean Masters) I Cry'd loud, and fervently, (Lord) save me least I perish: whereupon, The Tempest ceased soone./ [66] Conversion Gold is the chiefest labour of the sunne: Gemmes are his artifice: His beames intrude Upon the darke Abysse, and Mansion Of the blind subterraneous multitude, Whereby his pow'r is shew'd. But true Conversion doth transcend the starres, Where it creates such joyes, that Gemmes, and Gold Compar'd with these, are vitiated wares, Thus Pious Soules more vertues doe infold, Then this great light doth hold: And him in force excell, As farre as Heaven doth Hell. [67] The Refuge Oh whether shall I flye? To Hills or Valleys: Where shall I hidden lye? T'escape the malice, Of my pursuers hote. No Mountaine high, No vale, or dismall Grotte, Can shelter mee: Yet on Mount Calvary, I kenne a Tree, Though seemeing seare, and dry, Yet t'is (I see) Laden with fruite divine, Whose shadow blest, All cursed Fiends decline: Oh here's my rest./ [68] The Mansion My Lord lay in a stable twice; First when his Godhead was, Plac'd in that homely edifice, Where the tame Oxe, and Asse, His Innemates were; and also when Hee did in Mee abide; That am a stable most uncleane, Defil'd with lusts, and pride: But when I call to mind, that Hee Vouchsafed to retaine, Some few poore Fishermen, to bee The chiefest of his traine, And how Hee chose the Province low, Of despis'd Galile, There his first miracle to showe, To prove his Deitye: Then I conceive that humble love, Which to this earthen cell, Him brought, from his bright Throne above, Caus'd him in mee to dwell. [69] The Imprese God mee a Rubye gave, And I therein, Desir'd t'ingrave, Some Imprese fine. The world did mee advise, There to display, High dignityes, And honours gay: Or treasures rich at least: The Flesh invites, To have imprest, There, all delights. While dubious counsells thus, Did mee divide, With various gusts, I look'd aside, And saw a blessed Name, Of one, who dy'd A death of shame, 'Cause Hee was try'd By unjust suffrages: His name then I, Made my Imprese, Most joyfully./ [70] Knowledge The subtile Adder doth refuse to heare Th' Inchanters sound, But layes one eare, Unto the ground, And stoppes the other with his venom'd tayle: But facile Eve, Through nature frayle, Would not bee deafe, Unto the serpents charmes; but him shee lent (without delay), Sense, and consent: The Apples gay, Did tempte her eye; and cursed Satans lye, Who falsly sayd, Shee should not dye, Her soule betray'd. And this Impostour fix'd another snare, For this poore Madame, Hee did declare, That shee, and Adam, Once haveing tasted this forbidden fruite, In science should, Prove absolute, And bee inrold Among th' immortall Gods: By this pretence, Hee so bewitchd, Her inward sense, Which through pride itch'd For knowledge; that shee wholy did submitt Unto his charmes, And did forgett, Ensueing harmes. Thus thirst of knowledge did on Mankind bring, The Curse, which shewes, It is a thing, That may produce Evill, as well as good; wee therefore must With holy fire, By love, not lust, The same desire./ [71] Prayer Though Jewish sacrifice (wee see) Extinguish'd bee, and out of date: Yet sacrifices still there bee, Which wee must daily immolate; Their sacrifice could not bee done, Without fine salt, and flames of fire: So wee, in our devotion, Must knowledge mixe, with hote desire: For Prayer without fervent zeale, And holy knowledge mix'd with this, A bond is without name, or seale: Of no effect, and force it is. [72] Sicknes Sicknes is Balme of Gilead, It makes the dead to live, Breakes Satans head. It is a life contemplative, The soules Memento sweet, It settes all right, And in safe pathes directs our feet: It is a golden bitte, For sinnes restraint: It makes our soules cease to bee idle, Although our bodyes faint: It youth doth bridle, And middle Ages makes to thinke, Of their declineing state, And how they sinke, Toward the common House of fate: It is a bitter pill, Which renders life, Although it doth the body kill: It is Heavens pruneing knife, Which by abscission, Doth sinfull branches take away, And mends the soules condition: What shall I say? Although it bee the bodyes griefe, It is the soules reliefe./ [73] The World What magicke spell Confines mee to this Circle wide? What characters devis'd by arts of Hell, Have my affections to this prison ty'd? This place of exile, where my life, No better is then lingring death; This stage of strife, Where with such paine I draw my vitall breath. A Holy knot, And league, that's solemnly combin'd, T'wixt two unequall partyes makes mee dote Upon this place, where I small comfort find; But t'is decreed, I must abide, 'Till Death shall with impartiall blade, This knot divide, And all my sorowes in the grave unlade. But thou (Oh Lord) Which in the Lions denne dids't save Thy servant Daniel, and didst him afford, What his necessityes did duely crave, From roareing Lions mee defend, And let mee necessaryes find, Which may incende, (Unto thy praise, and glory) my weake mind./ [74] Preacheing Some, sermons preache, as if they yet had not That old Comedians Aphorisme forgott, Which they in unripe yeares at schoole did learne: All their instructions holy doe concerne, Chiefely the pleaseing of the people, who Returne, as from a play they wont to doe: They praise the Preachers learning, and his voyce: They in his witt, and fine conceites rejoyce: Such Preachers seeme Embassadours, not sent For busynes, but for mere complement. And some are like a foolish Leache, who gives Sweet cordialls, in stead of corrosives: And rather then Hee will incisions trye, Or cauterismes, will let his patient dye. Some preach all peace, when They should denounc[e] warre, 'Gainst Satan, Sinne, and Vice irregular: And some on needles ceremonyes stand, As things that must be done by Gods command. Few (like John Baptist) doe repentance preache, Or (like the Elder Prophets) their lungs stretche With Proclamation of those judgements dire, Which Heaven doth threaten, and our sinnes require. (Like Ahabs Prophets) some with raptures mad, Dare Kings, send up to Ramoth Gilead: Some turne the pulpitt to the Plaustrum old, Where they their private passions venting, scolde. Most preach to please, but happy's Hee, that can Preach, both to please his God, and profite Man. [75] Memorye Thou, that of all parts, Merits't to bee call'd, The Roome, and Armarye of arts, Which in Thee are wall'd, There by the intellect inclos'd, Mays't bee to better use transpos'd. Cast out this false ware, And now bring me in, An hollow scalpe, naked, and bare, The relique of sinne; This wormes fragment may doe more good, Then painted papers, which there stood. Those Foli'os hence throwe, And that Picture bring, Which doth a thousand tortures showe, Guilty soules to sting: This will doe better, then a storye, That kindles self love, or vaine-glory. Those guilte bookes sette by, And in their roomes place, The Palme, and Crowne; those ensignes high Of th' achieved race: This Closett now, which was profane, Is cleans'd, and become Christian. [76] Simplicitye A middle way some did attempte to find, T'wixt Truth, and Falsity: But They their Logicke lost, or left behind, And their philosophye, When they this taske assum'd: They did forgett, That contradictoryes, Will not of any Medium's admitt: Wee reade in historyes, Of many who attempted for to sayle, By seas bound up in ice, To th' Indyes; though each one did ever fayle, In this bold enterprise: But these our Navigatours did assay, To sayle by lukewarme seas, And unto Heaven to find a middle way, Which God did never please. For wee must travell through the Torride zone, Since without ardent zeale, Religion's but a thing of fashion, A playster not to heale, But rather hide a sore. That heavenly flame, Kept by the Jewes entire, Untill their Preistehood vendible became, Expos'd to sale and hire, A type was of this defecated wine, This gold throughly refin'd, Sent from above, not from an earthly mine, To deifye Mans mind: Religious zeale, that fiery charrett is, Wherein Eliah mounted; It lifts us to the skyes: To bee remisse, Is for contempt accounted. Hermaphrodites in faith, more odious bee, Then those, which come from Nature: Centaures, and Harpyes, doe with these aggree, In twofold shape, and feature: Partye per pale no lawfull beareing is, In holy Armorye: Religion hates a linsey woolsey dresse, Allowes of no mixte dye: No Paphlagonian Partridges shee loves, But single hearted Doves. Give mee that Person, who can humbly vaunt, Hee was at Rome, a perfect Protestant. [77] Self-Love Self love's th' Arcadian streame, A brittle Lookeinglasse, A transitory dreame, Of what nor is, nor shall ere come to passe. How doth it falsifye the face Of our abilityes, and make us seeme Cedars, that are but grasse. The poisno'us Cockatrice, If shee chance to surveye Her owne effigies, In a cleare Mirroir, doth her owne self slay: So while wee prye in thee all day, Doteing upon our selves, with partiall eyes, Our lives wee weare away. The crooked Camel loves The troubled Element, With Spongye heele Hee moves The fluide water, and strives to prevent The sight of what Hee disapproves, Then with asswaged thirst, and well content, Hee through the deserts roves. Thus seemes it better farre, Not to behold, or see How wee deformed are, Then foolishly enamourd for to bee Of what to us may appeare rare: But rather like blind Owles, then Camells wee, Thinke our deform'dnes faire. [78] The Hermite Bury'd alive I dwell (Like a defiled Vestall) in a cell: This habitation is Better, then Hell: Here solitude I kisse, And mende what is defective, or amisse: T'is better to want aire, Then to loose Heaven: chast soules from fountaines faire, Drawe better drinke then wine, Which for dispaire, Is an ill medicine, Mi'xte with more Opium, then Alkermes fine. Unbloudy savage diet, Unsmoky suppers, drest without disquiet, Doe sweeter sleepes procure, Then feasts of riot: Dry soules are wise, and pure, And to bee sober is to bee secure. Full glasses fowle the braines, And while wee seeke to wash away the staynes, Of some sad motions, We find more paines; Such nimious potions, Are rather impure sinkes, then cleanseing lotions./ [79] Retribution What shall I render to the Lord, For all his gifts and benefits? What recompence will Hee accord T'accept? what sacrifice befittes Such infinite vouchsafements? how Shall I poore wretch pay what I owe? For I am so voyde of what's good, That I am in a farre worse state, Then Hee who for mere want of foode, Did perish at the Rich mans gate, His body onely was unsound, But my soule doth with sores abound. And all my members are unmeete For pious use: My heart, and head, Defective are: my hands, and feet, Are impotent: yea, I am dead, Or paralyticall (at least) And if I live, am but a Beast./ A Beast, which God did not designe For sacrifice, bicause uncleane: For I a Dog am, or a swine, That often have retird ag'en, Unto my vomite, and the mire, Not fitt for holy, but Hell fire. (Lord) purge mee from my errours all, Thine image faire in mee renue; My heart, head, hands, and feet, then shall Strive to discharge what is thy due: But (for arrieres) I thee implore They may be sett on Jesu's score./ [80] Remorse Oh that my unrelenting eyes, Could like two headed Jordan flow, Who doth in swelling pride arise, Enrich'd by Lebanons warme snow. The Cocke hath crow'd, and crow'd againe, Yet I in Sinne securely sleepe, And wakeing, yet from teares refraine, Oh that I could an Ocean weepe. (Oh Eyes) looke downward, and regarde That Darknes, and that Lake of fire, Which destin'd is for Sinners hard; Such objects sad y? teares require. (Oh Eyes) looke backward, on those crimes, Which I did greedily committ, In many places, at all times: (Oh stony Eyes) what no teares yet? (Oh Eyes) looke upward, and behold My God revil'd, condemn'd, and scourg'd, Weaken'd with torments manifold, Yet to support his owne Crosse urg'd. Looke how my Lord his blood did shed, What Hellish paines in soule Hee felt, Boweing to death his glorious head: Now, Now mine Eyes to fountaines melt./ L'Envoy (Oh Lord) I confesse with shame, I ought not to mixe thy name, Either in my prose, or verse, If not sprinkled with my teares, Which cannot doe any good, Except colour'd by the blood, Of that Lambe unspotted slaine, Us to free from endles paine: His bloud was like scarlet bright, Yet scarlet sinnes, it makes white: Hee did conquer death, by death, Which to us did life bequeathe: Hee the Lilly was 'mongst thornes, Scourged, and expos'd to scornes, Judg'd to dye, yet King of Glory Guiltles slaine: This is his storye, Which when faithfull hearts shall reade, Each shall droppes of pitty bleede, And with sorow wounded cry, My Sinne caus'd my Lord to dye./ FINIS</field>
