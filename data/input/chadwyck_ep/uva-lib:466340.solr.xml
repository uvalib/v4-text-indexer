      <field name="fulltext">I Alice's Adventures in Wonderland [All in the golden afternoon] All in the golden afternoon Full leisurely we glide; For both our oars, with little skill, By little arms are plied, While little hands make vain pretence Our wanderings to guide. Ah, cruel Three! In such an hour, Beneath such dreamy weather, To beg a tale of breath too weak To stir the tiniest feather! Yet what can one poor voice avail Against three tongues together? Imperious Prima flashes forth Her edict “to begin it”: In gentler tones Secunda hopes “There will be nonsense in it!” While Tertia interrupts the tale Not more than once a minute. Anon, to sudden silence won, In fancy they pursue The dream-child moving through a land Of wonders wild and new, In friendly chat with bird or beast— And half believe it true. And ever, as the story drained The wells of fancy dry, And faintly strove that weary one To put the subject by, “The rest next time—” “It is next time!” The happy voices cry. Thus grew the tale of Wonderland: Thus slowly, one by one, Its quaint events were hammered out— And now the tale is done, And home we steer, a merry crew. Beneath the setting sun. Alice! A childish story take, And, with a gentle hand, Lay it where Childhood's dreams are twined In Memory's mystic band. Like pilgrim's wither'd wreath of flowers Pluck'd in a far-off land. CHRISTMAS-GREETINGS [FROM A FAIRY TO A CHILD] Lady dear, if Fairies may For a moment lay aside Cunning tricks and elfish play, 'Tis at happy Christmas-tide. We have heard the children say— Gentle children, whom we love— Long ago, on Christmas Day, Came a message from above. Still, as Christmas-tide come round, They remember it again— Echo still the joyful sound “Peace on earth, good-will to men!” Yet the hearts must childlike be Where such heavenly guests abide; Unto children, in their glee, All the year is Christmas-tide! Thus, forgetting tricks and play For a moment, Lady dear, We would wish you, if we may, Merry Christmas, glad New Year! Christmas, 1867. Chapter I Down the Rabbit-Hole [“How doth the little crocodile] “How doth the little crocodile Improve his shining tail, And pour the waters of the Nile On every golden scale! “How cheerfully he seems to grin, How neatly spreads his claws, And welcomes little fishes in, With gently smiling jaws! Chapter V Advice from a Caterpillar [“You are old, Father William,” the young man said] “You are old, Father William,” the young man said “And your hair has become very white; And yet you incessantly stand on your head— Do you think, at your age, it is right?” “In my youth,” Father William replied to his son, “I feared it might injure the brain; But, now that I'm perfectly sure I have none, Why, I do it again and again.” “You are old,” said the youth, “as I mentioned before. And have grown most uncommonly fat; Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door— Pray, what is the reason of that?” “In my youth,” said the sage, as he shook his grey locks, “I kept all my limbs very supple By the use of this ointment—one shilling the box— Allow me to sell you a couple?” “You are old,” said the youth, “and your jaws are too weak For anything tougher than suet; Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak— Pray, how did you manage to do it?” “In my youth,” said his father, “I took to the law, And argued each case with my wife; And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw Has lasted the rest of my life.” “You are old,” said the youth, “one would hardly suppose That your eye was as steady as ever; Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose— What made you so awfully clever?” “I have answered three questions and that is enough,” Said his father. “Don't give yourself airs! Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff? Be off, or I'll kick you down-stairs!” Chapter VI Pig and Pepper [“Speak roughly to your little boy] “Speak roughly to your little boy, And beat him when he sneezes: He only does it to annoy, Because he knows it teases.” Chorus “Wow! wow! wow!” “I speak severely to my boy, I beat him when he sneezes; For he can thoroughly enjoy The pepper when he pleases!” Chorus “Wow! wow! wow!” Chapter VII A Mad Tea-Party [‘Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!] ‘Twinkle, twinkle, little bat! How I wonder what you're at!’ ‘Up above the world you fly, Like a tea-tray in the sky. Twinkle, twinkle—’” Chapter X The Lobster-Quadrille [“Will you walk a little faster?” said a whiting to a snail] “Will you walk a little faster?” said a whiting to a snail, “There's a porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my tail. See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance! They are waiting on the shingle—will you come and join the dance? Will you, wo'n't you, will you, wo'n't you, will you join the dance? Will you, wo'n't you, will you, wo'n't you, wo'n't you join the dance? “You can really have no notion how delightful it will be When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!” But the snail replied “Too far, too far!” and gave a look askance— Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance. Would not, could not, would not. could not, could not join the dance. Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance. “What matters it how far we go?” his scaly friend replied. The further off from England the nearer is to France. There is another shore, you know, upon the other side. Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance. Will you, wo'n't you, will you, wo'n't you, will you join the dance? Will you, wo'n't you, will you, wo'n't you, will you join the dance?” [“'Tis the voice of the Lobster: I heard him declare] “'Tis the voice of the Lobster: I heard him declare ‘You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.’ As a duck with his eyelids, so he with his nose Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes. When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark, And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark: But, when the tide rises and sharks are around, His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.” [“I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye] “I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye, How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie: The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat, While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat. When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon, Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon: While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl, And concluded the banquet by—” [“Beautiful Soup, so rich and green] “Beautiful Soup, so rich and green, Waiting in a hot tureen! Who for such dainties would not stoop? Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup! Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup! Beau—ootiful Soo—oop! Beau—ootiful Soo—oop! Soo—oop of the e—e—evening, Beautiful, beautiful Soup! “Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish, Game, or any other dish? Who would not give all else for two p ennyworth only of beautiful Soup? Pennyworth only of beautiful soup? Beau—ootiful Soo—oop! Beau—ootiful Soo—oop! Soo—oop of the e—e—evening, Beautiful, beauti—FUL SOUP!” Chapter XII Alice's Evidence [“They told me you had been to her] “They told me you had been to her, And mentioned me to him: She gave me a good character, But said I could not swim. He sent them word I had not gone (We know it to be true): If she should push the matter on, What would become of you? I gave her one, they gave him two, You gave us three or more; They all returned from him to you, Though they were mine before. If I or she should chance to be Involved in this affair, He trusts to you to set them free, Exactly as we were. My notion was that you had been (Before she had this fit) An obstacle that came between Him, and ourselves, and it. Don't let him know she liked them best, For this must ever be A secret, kept from all the rest, Between yourself and me.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II Through the Looking-Glass and what Alice found there [Child of the pure unclouded brow] Child of the pure unclouded brow And dreaming eyes of wonder! Though time be fleet, and I and thou And half a life asunder, Thy loving smile will surely hail The love-gift of a fairy-tale. I have not seen thy sunny face, Nor heard thy silver laughter: No thought of me shall find a place In thy young life's hereafter— Enough that now thou wilt not fail To listen to my fairy-tale. A tale begun in other days, When summer suns were glowing— A simple chime, that served to time The rhythm of our rowing— Whose echoes live in memory yet, Through envious years would say “forget.” Come, hearken then, ere voice of dread, With bitter tidings laden, Shall summon to unwelcome bed A melancholy maiden! We are but older children, dear, Who fret to find our bedtime near. Without, the frost, the blinding snow, The storm-wind's moody madness— Within, the firelight's ruddy glow, And childhood's nest of gladness. The magic words shall hold thee fast: Thou shalt not heed the raving blast. And, though the shadow of a sigh May tremble through the story, For “happy summer days” gone by, And vanish'd summer glory— It shall not touch, with breath of bale, The pleasance of our fairy-tale. Chapter I Looking-Glass House JABBERWOCKY 'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe: All mimsy were the borogoves, And the mome raths outgrabe. “Beware the Jabberwock, my son! The jaws that bite, the claws that catch! Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun The frumious Bandersnatch!” He took his vorpal sword in hand: Long time the manxome foe he sought— So rested he by the Tumtum tree, And stood awhile in thought. And, as in uffish thought he stood, The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame, Came whiffling through the tulgey wood, And burbled as it came! One, two! One, two! And through and through The vorpal blade went snicker-snack! He left it dead, and with its head He went galumphing back. “And hast thou slain the Jabberwock? Come to my arms, my beamish boy! O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!” He chortled in his joy. 'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe: All mimsy were the borogoves, And the mome raths outgrabe. Chapter IV Tweedledum and Tweedledee [“The sun was shining on the sea] “The sun was shining on the sea, Shining with all his might: He did his very best to make The billows smooth and bright— And this was odd, because it was The middle of the night. The moon was shining sulkily, Because she thought the sun Had got no business to be there After the day was done— ‘It's very rude of him,’ she said, ‘To come and spoil the fun!’ The sea was wet as wet could be, The sands were dry as dry. You could not see a cloud, because No cloud was in the sky: No birds were flying overhead— There were no birds to fly. The Walrus and the Carpenter Were walking close at hand: They wept like anything to see Such quantities of sand: ‘If this were only cleared away,’ They said, ‘it would be grand!’ ‘If seven maids with seven mops Swept it for half a year, Do you suppose,’ the Walrus said, ‘That they could get it clear?’ ‘I doubt it,’ said the Carpenter, And shed a bitter tear. ‘O Oysters, come and walk with us!’ The Walrus did beseech. ‘A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk, Along the briny beach: We cannot do with more than four, To give a hand to each.’ The eldest Oyster looked at him, But never a word he said: The eldest Oyster winked his eye, And shook his heavy head— Meaning to say he did not choose To leave the oyster-bed. But four young Oysters hurried up, All eager for the treat: Their coats were brushed, their faces washed, Their shoes were clean and neat— And this was odd, because, you know, They hadn't any feet. Four other Oysters followed them, And yet another four; And thick and fast they came at last, And more, and more, and more— All hopping through the frothy waves, And scrambling to the shore. The Walrus and the Carpenter Walked on a mile or so, And then they rested on a rock Conveniently low: And all the little Oysters stood And waited in a row. ‘The time has come,’ the Walrus said, ‘To talk of many things: Of shoes—and ships—and sealing wax— Of cabbages—and—kings— And why the sea is boiling hot— And whether pigs have wings.’ ‘But wait a bit,’ the Oysters cried, ‘Before we have our chat; For some of us are out of breath, And all of us are fat!’ ‘No hurry!’ said the Carpenter. They thanked him much for that. ‘A loaf of bread’ the Walrus said, ‘Is what we chiefly need: Pepper and vinegar besides Are very good indeed— Now, if you're ready, Oysters dear, We can begin to feed.’ ‘But not on us!’ the Oysters cried, Turning a little blue. ‘After such kindness, that would be A dismal thing to do!’ ‘The night is fine,’ the Walrus said. ‘Do you admire the view? ‘It was so kind of you to come! And you are very nice!’ The Carpenter said nothing but ‘Cut us another slice. I wish you were not quite so deaf— I've had to ask you twice!’ ‘It seems a shame,’ the Walrus said ‘To play them such a trick. After we've brought them out so far, And made them trot so quick!’ The Carpenter said nothing but ‘The butter's spread too thick!’ ‘I weep for you,’ the Walrus said: ‘I deeply sympathize.’ With sobs and tears he sorted out Those of the largest size, Holding his pocket-handkerchief Before his streaming eyes. ‘O Oysters,’ said the Carpenter, ‘You've had a pleasant run! Shall we be trotting home again?’ But answer came there none— And this was scarcely odd, because They'd eaten every one.” Chapter VI Humpty Dumpty [“In spring, when woods are getting green] “In spring, when woods are getting green, I'll try and tell you what I mean:” “In summer, when the days are long, Perhaps you'll understand the song: In autumn, when the leaves are brown, Take pen and ink, and write it down.” “I sent a message to the fish: I told them ‘This is what I wish.’ The little fishes of the sea, They sent an answer back to me. The little fishes' answer was ‘We cannot do it, Sir, because—’” “I sent to them again to say ‘It will be better to obey.’ The fishes answered, with a grin, ‘Why, what a temper you are in!’ I told them once, I told them twice: They would not listen to advice. I took a kettle large and new, Fit for the deed I had to do. My heart went hop, my heart went thump: I filled the kettle at the pump. Then some one came to me and said ‘The little fishes are in bed.’ I said to him, I said it plain, ‘Then you must wake them up again.’ I said it very loud and clear: I went and shouted in his ear.” “But he was very stiff and proud: He said, ‘You needn't shout so loud!’ And he was very proud and stiff: He said ‘I'd go and wake them, if—’ I took a corkscrew from the shelf: I went to wake them up myself. And when I found the door was locked, I pulled and pushed and kicked and knocked. And when I found the door was shut, I tried to turn the handle, but—” Chapter VIII “It's My Own Invention” [“I'll tell thee everything I can] “I'll tell thee everything I can: There's little to relate. I saw an aged aged man, A-sitting on a gate. ‘Who are you, aged man?’ I said. ‘And how is it you live?’ And his answer trickled through my head, Like water through a sieve. He said ‘I look for butterflies That sleep among the wheat: I make them into mutton-pies, And sell them in the street. I sell them unto men,’ he said, ‘Who sail on stormy seas; And that's the way I get my bread— A trifle, if you please.’ But I was thinking of a plan To dye one's whiskers green, And always use so large a fan That they could not be seen. So, having no reply to give To what the old man said, I cried ‘Come, tell me how you live!’ And thumped him on the head. His accents mild took up the tale: He said ‘I go my ways, And when I find a mountain-rill, I set it in a blaze; And thence they make a stuff they call Rowland's Macassar-Oil— Yet twopence-halfpenny is all They give me for my toil.’ But I was thinking of a way To feed oneself on batter, And so go on from day to day Getting a little fatter. I shook him well from side to side, Until his face was blue: ‘Come, tell me how you live,’ I cried, ‘And what it is you do!’ He said ‘I hunt for haddocks’ eyes Among the heather bright, And work them into waistcoat-buttons In the silent night. And these I do not sell for gold Or coin of silvery shine, But for a copper halfpenny. And that will purchase nine. ‘I sometimes dig for buttered rolls, Or set limed twigs for crabs: I sometimes search the grassy knolls For wheels of Hansom-cabs. And that's the way’ (he gave a wink) ‘By which I get my wealth— And very gladly will I drink Your Honour's noble health.’ I heard him then, for I had just Completed my design To keep the Menai bridge from rust By boiling it in wine. I thanked him much for telling me The way he got his wealth, But chiefly for his wish that he Might drink my noble health. And now, if e'er by chance I put My fingers into glue, Or madly squeeze a right-hand foot Into a left-hand shoe, Or if I drop upon my toe A very heavy weight, I weep for it reminds me so Of that old man I used to know— Whose look was mild, whose speech was slow Whose hair was whiter than the snow, Whose face was very like a crow, With eyes, like cinders, all aglow, Who seemed distracted with his woe, Who rocked his body to and fro. And muttered mumblingly and low, As if his mouth were full of dough, Who snorted like a buffalo— That summer evening long ago, A-sitting on a gate.” Chapter IX Queen Alice [“To the Looking-Glass world it was Alice that said] “To the Looking-Glass world it was Alice that said ‘I've a sceptre in hand I've a crown on my head. Let the Looking-Glass creatures, whatever they be Come and dine with the Red Queen, the White Queen, and me!’” “Then fill up the glasses as quick as you can, And sprinkle the table with buttons and bran: Put cats in the coffee, and mice in the tea— And welcome Queen Alice with thirty-times-three!” “‘O Looking-Glass creatures,’ quoth Alice, draw near! 'Tis an honour to see me, a favour to hear: 'Tis a privilege high to have dinner and tea Along with the Red Queen, the White Queen, and me!’” “Then fill up the glasses with treacle and ink, Or anything else that is pleasant to drink: Mix sand with the cider, and wool with the wine— And welcome Queen Alice with ninety-times-nine!” [“‘First, the fish must be caught.’] “‘First, the fish must be caught.’ That is easy: a baby, I think, could have caught it. ‘Next, the fish must be bought.’ That is easy: a penny, I think, would have bought it. ‘Now cook me the fish!’ That is easy, and will not take more than a minute. ‘Let it lie in a dish!’ That is easy, because it already is in it. ‘Bring it here! Let me sup!’ It is easy to set such a dish on the table. ‘Take the dish-cover up!’ Ah, that is so hard that I fear I'm unable! For it holds it like glue— Holds the lid to the dish, while it lies in the middle: Which is easiest to do, Un-dish-cover the fish, or dishcover the riddle?” [A boat, beneath a sunny sky] A boat, beneath a sunny sky Lingering onward dreamily In an evening of July— Children three that nestle near, Eager eye and willing ear, Pleased a simple tale to hear— Long has paled that sunny sky: Echoes fade and memories die: Autumn frosts have slain July. Still she haunts me, phantomwise. Alice moving under skies Never seen by waking eyes. Children yet, the tale to hear, Eager eye and willing ear, Lovingly shall nestle near. In a Wonderland they lie, Dreaming as the days go by, Dreaming as the summers die: Ever drifting down the stream— Lingering in the golden gleam— Life, what is it but a dream?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III Sylvie and Bruno [Is all our Life, then, but a dream] Is all our Life, then, but a dream Seen faintly in the golden gleam Athwart Time's dark resistless stream? Bowed to the earth with bitter woe, Or laughing at some raree-show, We flutter idly to and fro. Man's little Day in haste we spend, And, from its merry noontide, send No glance to meet the silent end. PREFACE [“Who sins in hope, who, sinning, says] “Who sins in hope, who, sinning, says, ‘Sorrow for sin God's judgement stays!’ Against God's Spirit he lies; quite stops Mercy with insult; dares, and drops, Like a scorch'd fly, that spins in vain Upon the axis of its pain, Then takes its doom, to limp and crawl, Blind and forgot, from fall to fall.” [“Farewell, farewell! but this I tell] “Farewell, farewell! but this I tell To thee, thou Wedding-Guest! He prayeth well, who loveth well Both man and bird and beast. He prayeth best, who loveth best All things both great and small; For the dear God who loveth us, He made and loveth all.” Chapter V A Beggar's Palace [“From sackcloth couch the Monk arose] “From sackcloth couch the Monk arose, With toil his stiffen'd limbs he rear'd; A hundred years had flung their snows On his thin locks and floating beard.” [“He thought he saw an Elephant] “He thought he saw an Elephant, That practised on a fife: He looked again, and found it was A letter from his wife. ‘At length I realise,’ he said, ‘The bitterness of Life.’” Chapter VI The Magic Locket [“He thought he saw a Buffalo] “He thought he saw a Buffalo Upon the chimney-piece: He looked again, and found it was His Sister's Husband's Niece. ‘Unless you leave this house,’ he said, ‘I'll send for the Police!’” [“He thought he saw a Rattlesnake] “He thought he saw a Rattlesnake That questioned him in Greek: He looked again, and found it was The Middle of Next Week. ‘The one thing I regret,’ he said, ‘Is that it cannot speak!’” Chapter VII The Baron's Embassy [“He thought he saw a Banker's Clerk] “He thought he saw a Banker's Clerk Descending from the bus: He looked again, and found it was A Hippopotamus: ‘If this should stay to dine,’ he said, ‘There won't be much for us!’” Chapter VIII A Ride on a Lion [“He thought he saw a Kangaroo] “He thought he saw a Kangaroo That worked a coffee-mill: He looked again, and found it was A Vegetable-Pill. ‘Were I to swallow this,’ he said, ‘I should be very ill!’” [“Let craft, ambition, spite] “Let craft, ambition, spite, Be quenched in Reason's night, Till weakness turn to might, Till what is dark be light, Till what is wrong be right!” Chapter IX A Jester and a Bear [“He thought he saw a Coach-and-Four] “He thought he saw a Coach-and-Four That stood beside his bed: He looked again, and found it was A Bear without a Head. ‘Poor thing,’ he said, ‘poor silly thing! It's waiting to be fed!’” Chapter X The Other Professor [There was a Pig, that sat alone] There was a Pig, that sat alone, Beside a ruined Pump. By day and night he made his moan: It would have stirred a heart of stone To see him wring his hoofs and groan, Because he could not jump. Chapter XI Peter and Paul [‘Peter is poor,’ said noble Paul] ‘Peter is poor,’ said noble Paul, ‘And I have always been his friend: And, though my means to give are small, At least I can afford to lend. How few, in this cold age of greed, Do good, except on selfish grounds! But I can feel for Peter's need, And I WILL LEND HIM FIFTY POUNDS!’ How great was Peter's joy to find His friend in such a genial vein! How cheerfully the bond he signed, To pay the money back again! ‘We ca'n't,’ said Paul, ‘be too precise: 'Tis best to fix the very day: So, by a learned friend's advice, I've made it Noon, the Fourth of May.’ ‘But this is April!’ Peter said. ‘The First of April, as I think. Five little weeks will soon be fled: One scarcely will have time to wink! Give me a year to speculate— To buy and sell—to drive a trade—’ Said Paul ‘I cannot change the date. On May the Fourth it must be paid.’ ‘Well, well!’ said Peter, with a sigh. ‘Hand me the cash, and I will go. I'll form a Joint-Stock Company, And turn an honest pound or so.’ ‘I'm grieved,’ said Paul, ‘to seem unkind: The money shall of course be lent: But, for a week or two, I find It will not be convenient.’ So, week by week, poor Peter came And turned in heaviness away; For still the answer was the same, ‘I cannot manage it to-day.’ And now the April showers were dry— The five short weeks were nearly spent— Yet still he got the old reply, ‘It is not quite convenient!’ The Fourth arrived, and punctual Paul Came, with his legal friend, at noon. ‘I thought it best,’ said he, ‘to call: One cannot settle things too soon.’ Poor Peter shuddered in despair: His flowing locks he wildly tore: And very soon his yellow hair Was lying all about the floor. The legal friend was standing by, With sudden pity half unmanned: The tear-drop trembled in his eye, The signed agreement in his hand: But when at length the legal soul Resumed its customary force, ‘The Law,’ he said, ‘we ca'n't control: Pay, or the Law must take its course!’ Said Paul ‘How bitterly I rue That fatal morning when I called! Consider, Peter, what you do! You won't be richer when you're bald! Think you, by rending curls away, To make your difficulties less? Forbear this violence, I pray: You do but add to my distress!’ ‘Not willingly would I inflict,’ Said Peter, ‘on that noble heart One needless pang. Yet why so strict? Is this to act a friendly part? However legal it may be To pay what never has been lent, This style of business seems to me Extremely inconvenient! ‘No Nobleness of soul have I, Like some that in this Age are found!’ (Paul blushed in sheer humility, And cast his eyes upon the ground.) ‘This debt will simply swallow all, And make my life a life of woe!’ ‘Nay, nay, my Peter!’ answered Paul. ‘You must not rail on Fortune so! ‘You have enough to eat and drink: You are respected in the world: And at the barber's, as I think, You often get your whiskers curled. Though Nobleness you ca'n't attain— To any very great extent— The path of Honesty is plain, However inconvenient!’ ‘'Tis true,’ said Peter, ‘I'm alive: I keep my station in the world: Once in the week I just contrive To get my whiskers oiled and curled. But my assets are very low: My little income's overspent: To trench on capital, you know, Is always inconvenient!’ ‘But pay your debts!’ cried honest Paul. ‘My gentle Peter, pay your debts! What matter if it swallows all That you describe as your “assets”? Already you're an hour behind: Yet Generosity is best. It pinches me—but never mind! I WILL NOT CHARGE YOU INTEREST!’ ‘How good! How great!’ poor Peter cried. ‘Yet I must sell my Sunday wig— The scarf-pin that has been my pride— My grand piano—and my pig!’ Full soon his property took wings: And daily, as each treasure went, He sighed to find the state of things Grow less and less convenient. Weeks grew to months, and months to years: Peter was worn to skin and bone: And once he even said, with tears, ‘Remember, Paul, that promised Loan!’ Said Paul ‘I'll lend you, when I can, All the spare money I have got— Ah, Peter, you're a happy man! Yours is an enviable lot! ‘I'm getting stout, as you may see: It is but seldom I am well: I cannot feel my ancient glee In listening to the dinner-bell: But you, you gambol like a boy, Your figure is so spare and light: The dinner-bell's a note of joy To such a healthy appetite!’ Said Peter ‘I am well aware Mine is a state of happiness: And yet how gladly could I spare Some of the comforts I possess! What you call healthy appetite I feel as Hunger's savage tooth: And, when no dinner is in sight, The dinner-bell's a sound of ruth! ‘No scare-crow would accept this coat: Such boots as these you seldom see, Ah, Paul, a single five-pound-note Would make another man of me!’ Said Paul ‘It fills me with surprise To hear you talk in such a tone: I fear you scarcely realise The blessings that are all your own! ‘You're safe from being overfed: You're sweetly picturesque in rags: You never know the aching head That comes along with money-bags: And you have time to cultivate That best of qualities, Content— For which you'll find your present state Remarkably convenient!’ Said Peter ‘Though I cannot sound The depths of such a man as you, Yet in your character I've found An inconsistency or two. You seem to have long years to spare When there's a promise to fulfil: And yet how punctual you were In calling with that little bill!’ ‘One ca'n't be too deliberate,’ Said Paul, ‘in parting with one's pelf. With bills, as you correctly state, I'm punctuality itself. A man may surely claim his dues: But, when there's money to be lent, A man must be allowed to choose Such times as are convenient!’ It chanced one day, as Peter sat Gnawing a crust—his usual meal— Paul bustled in to have a chat, And grasped his hand with friendly zeal. ‘I knew,’ said he, ‘your frugal ways: So, that I might not wound your pride By bringing strangers in to gaze, I've left my legal friend outside! ‘You well remember, I am sure, When first your wealth began to go, And people sneered at one so poor, I never used my Peter so! And when you'd lost your little all, And found yourself a thing despised, I need not ask you to recall How tenderly I sympathised! ‘Then the advice I've poured on you, So full of wisdom and of wit: All given gratis, though 'tis true I might have fairly charged for it! But I refrain from mentioning Full many a deed I might relate— For boasting is a kind of thing That I particularly hate. ‘How vast the total sum appears Of all the kindnesses I've done, From Childhood's half-forgotten years Down to that Loan of April One! That Fifty Pounds! You little guessed How deep it drained my slender store: But there's a heart within this breast, And I WILL LEND YOU FIFTY MORE!’ ‘Not so,’ was Peter's mild reply, His cheeks all wet with grateful tears: ‘No man recalls, so well as I, Your services in bygone years: And this new offer, I admit, Is very very kindly meant— Still, to avail myself of it Would not be quite convenient!’ Chapter XII A Musical Gardener [“He thought he saw an Albatross] “He thought he saw an Albatross That fluttered round the lamp: He looked again, and found it was A Penny-Postage-Stamp. ‘You'd best be getting home,’ he said: ‘The nights are very damp!’” [“He thought he saw a Garden-Door] “He thought he saw a Garden-Door That opened with a key: He looked again, and found it was A Double Rule of Three: ‘And all its mystery,’ he said, ‘Is clear as day to me!’” Chapter XV Bruno's Revenge [“Rise, oh, rise! The daylight dies] “Rise, oh, rise! The daylight dies: The owls are hooting, ting, ting, ting! Wake, oh, wake! Beside the lake The elves are fluting, ting, ting, ting! Welcoming our Fairy King, We sing, sing, sing.” “Hear, oh, hear! From far and near The music stealing, ting, ting, ting! Fairy bells adown the dells Are merrily pealing, ting, ting, ting! Welcoming our Fairy King, We ring, ring, ring. “See, oh, see! On every tree What lamps are shining, ting, ting, ting! They are eyes of fiery flies To light our dining, ting, ting, ting! Welcoming our Fairy King They swing, swing, swing. “Haste, oh, haste, to take and taste The dainties waiting, ting, ting, ting! Honey-dew is stored—” Chapter XVII The Three Badgers [“There be three Badgers on a mossy stone] “There be three Badgers on a mossy stone, Beside a dark and covered way: Each dreams himself a monarch on his throne, And so they stay and stay— Though their old Father languishes alone, They stay, and stay, and stay. “There be three Herrings loitering around, Longing to share that mossy seat: Each Herring tries to sing what she has found That makes Life seem so sweet. Thus, with a grating and uncertain sound, They bleat, and bleat, and bleat. “The Mother-Herring, on the salt sea-wave, Sought vainly for her absent ones: The Father-Badger, writhing in a cave, Shrieked out ‘Return, my sons! You shall have buns,’ he shrieked, ‘if you'll behave! Yea, buns, and buns, and buns!’ “‘I fear,’ said she, ‘your sons have gone astray? My daughters left me while I slept.’ ‘Yes'm,’ the Badger said: ‘it's as you say.’ ‘They should be better kept.’ Thus the poor parents talked the time away, And wept, and wept, and wept.” “Oh, dear beyond our dearest dreams, Fairer than all that fairest seems! To feast the rosy hours away, To revel in a roundelay! How blest would be A life so free— Ipwergis-Pudding to consume, And drink the subtle Azzigoom! “And if, in other days and hours, Mid other fluffs and other flowers, The choice were given me how to dine— ‘Name what thou wilt: it shall be thine!’ Oh, then I see The life for me— Ipwergis-Pudding to consume, And drink the subtle Azzigoom!” “The Badgers did not care to talk to Fish: They did not dote on Herrings' songs: They never had experienced the dish To which that name belongs: ‘And oh, to pinch their tails,’ (this was their wish,) ‘With tongs, yea, tongs, and tongs!’” “‘And are not these the Fish,’ the Eldest sighed, ‘Whose Mother dwells beneath the foam?’ ‘They are the Fish!’ the Second one replied. And they have left their home!’ ‘Oh wicked Fish,’ the Youngest Badger cried, ‘To roam, yea, roam, and roam!’ “Gently the Badgers trotted to the shore— The sandy shore that fringed the bay: Each in his mouth a living Herring bore— Those aged ones waxed gay: Clear rang their voices through the ocean's roar, ‘Hooray, hooray,hooray!’” Chapter XVIII Queer Street, Number Forty [‘How many miles to Babylon?] ‘How many miles to Babylon? Three-score miles and ten. Can I get there by candlelight? Yes, and back again!’” Chapter XX Light Come, Light Go [“He steps so lightly to the land] “He steps so lightly to the land, All in his manly pride: He kissed her cheek, he pressed her hand, Yet still she glanced aside. ‘Too gay he seems,’ she darkly dreams, ‘Too gallant and too gay To think of me—poor simple me— When he is far away!’ ‘I bring my Love this goodly pearl Across the seas,’ he said: ‘A gem to deck the dearest girl That ever sailor wed!’ She clasps it tight: her eyes are bright: Her throbbing heart would say ‘He thought of me—he thought of me— When he was far away!’ The ship has sailed into the West: Her ocean-bird is flown: A dull dead pain is in her breast, And she is weak and lone: Yet there's a smile upon her face, A smile that seems to say ‘He'll think of me—he'll think of me— When he is far away! ‘Though waters wide between us glide, Our lives are warm and near: No distance parts two faithful hearts— Two hearts that love so dear: And I will trust my sailor-lad, For ever and a day, To think of me—to think of me— When he is far away!’”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV Sylvie and Bruno Concluded [Dreams, that elude the Maker's frenzied grasp—] Dreams, that elude the Maker's frenzied grasp— Hands, stark and still, on a dead Mother's breast, Which nevermore shall render clasp for clasp, Or deftly soothe a weeping Child to rest— In suchlike forms me listeth to portray My Tale, here ended. Thou delicious Fay— The guardian of a Sprite that lives to tease thee— Loving in earnest, chiding but in play The merry mocking Bruno! Who, that sees thee, Can fail to love thee, Darling, even as I?— My sweetest Sylvie, we must say “Good-bye!” Chapter I Bruno's Lessons [“King Fisher courted Lady Bird—] “King Fisher courted Lady Bird— Sing Beans, sing Bones, sing Butterflies! ‘Find me my match,’ he said, ‘With such a noble head— With such a beard, as white as curd— With such expressive eyes!’ “‘Yet pins have heads,’ said Lady Bird— Sing Prunes, sing Prawns, sing Primrose-Hill! ‘And, where you stick them in, They stay, and thus a pin Is very much to be preferred To one that's never still!’ “‘Oysters have beards,’ said Lady Bird— Sing Flies, sing Frogs, sing Fiddle-strings! ‘I love them, for I know They never chatter so: They would not say one single word— Not if you crowned them Kings!’ “‘Needles have eyes,’ said Lady Bird— Sing Cats, sing Corks, sing Cowslip-tea! ‘And they are sharp—just what Your Majesty is not: So get you gone—'tis too absurd To come a-courting me!’” Chapter III Streaks of Dawn [“Take, O boatman, thrice thy fee] “Take, O boatman, thrice thy fee; Take, I give it willingly; For, invisible to thee, Spirits twain have crossed with me!” Chapter V Matilda Jane [“Matilda Jane, you never look] “Matilda Jane, you never look At any toy or picture-book: I show you pretty things in vain— You must be blind, Matilda Jane! “I ask you riddles, tell you tales, But all our conversation fails: You never answer me again— I fear you're dumb, Matilda Jane! “Matilda, darling, when I call, You never seem to hear at all: I shout with all my might and main— But you're so deaf, Matilda Jane! “Matilda Jane, you needn't mind: For, though you're deaf, and dumb, and blind, There's some one loves you, it is plain— And that is me, Matilda Jane!” [“There's him, an' yo', an' me] “There's him, an' yo', an' me, Roarin' laddies! We loves a bit o' spree, Roarin' laddies we, Roarin' laddies Roarin' laddies!” Chapter XIII What Tottles Meant [“One thousand pounds per annuum] “One thousand pounds per annuum Is not so bad a figure, come!” Cried Tottles. “And I tell you, flat, A man may marry well on that! To say ‘the Husband needs the Wife’ Is not the way to represent it. The crowning joy of Woman's life Is Man!” said Tottles (and he meant it). The blissful Honey-moon is past: The Pair have settled down at last: Mamma-in-law their home will share, And make their happiness her care. “Your income is an ample one: Go it, my children!” (And they went it). ‘I rayther think this kind of fun Won't last!” said Tottles (and he meant it). They took a little country-box— A box at Covent Garden also: They lived a life of double-knocks, Acquaintances began to call so: Their London house was much the same (It took three hundred, clear, to rent it): “Life is a very jolly game!” Cried happy Tottles (and he meant it). “Contented with a frugal lot” (He always used that phrase at Gunter's), He bought a handy little yacht— A dozen serviceable hunters— The fishing of a Highland Loch— A sailing-boat to circumvent it— “The sounding of that Gaelic ‘och’ Beats me!” said Tottles (and he meant it). But oh, the worst of human ills (Poor Tottles found) are “little bills”! And, with no balance in the Bank, What wonder that his spirits sank? Still, as the money flowed away, He wondered how on earth she spent it. “You cost me twenty pounds a day, At least!” cried Tottles (and he meant it). She sighed. “Those Drawing Rooms, you know! I really never thought about it: Mamma declared we ought to go— We should be Nobodies without it. That diamond-circlet for my brow— I quite believed that she had sent it, Until the Bill came in just now—” “Viper!” cried Tottles (and he meant it). Poor Mrs. T. could bear no more, But fainted flat upon the floor. Mamma-in-law, with anguish wild, Seeks, all in vain, to rouse her child. “Quick! Take this box of smelling-salts! Don't scold her, James, or you'll repent it, She's a dear girl, with all her faults—” “She is!” groaned Tottles (and he meant it). “I was a donkey,” Tottles cried, “To choose your daughter for my bride! 'Twas you that bid us cut a dash! 'Tis you have brought us to this smash! You don't suggest one single thing That can in any way prevent it—” “Then what's the use of arguing?” Shut up!” cried Tottles (and he meant it). “And, now the mischief's done, perhaps You'll kindly go and pack your traps? Since two (your daughter and your son) Are Company, but three are none. A course of saving we'll begin: When change is needed, I'll invent it: Don't think to put your finger in This pie!” cried Tottles (and he meant it) See now this couple settled down In quiet lodgings, out of town: Submissively the tearful wife Accepts a plain and humble life: Yet begs one boon on bended knee: “My ducky-darling, don't resent it! Mamma might come for two or three—” “NEVER!” yelled Tottles. And he meant it. Chapter XVI Beyond These Voices [‘We doubt not that, for one so true] ‘We doubt not that, for one so true, There must be other, nobler work to do, Than when he fought at Waterloo, And Victor he must ever be!’” Chapter XVII To the Rescue [In stature the Manlet was dwarfish—] In stature the Manlet was dwarfish— No burly big Blunderbore he: And he wearily gazed on the crawfish His Wifelet had dressed for his tea. “Now reach me, sweet Atom, my gunlet, And hurl the old shoelet for luck: Let me hie to the bank of the runlet, And shoot thee a Duck!” She has reached him his minikin gunlet: She has hurled the old shoelet for luck: She is busily baking a bunlet, To welcome him home with his Duck. On he speeds, never wasting a wordlet, Though thoughtlets cling, closely as wax, To the spot where the beautiful birdlet So quietly quacks. Where the Lobsterlet lurks, and the Crablet So slowly and sleepily crawls: Where the Dolphin's at home, and the Dablet Pays long ceremonious calls: Where the Grublet is sought by the Froglet: Where the Frog is pursued by the Duck: Where the Ducklet is chased by the Doglet— So runs the world's luck! He has loaded with bullet and powder: His footfall is noiseless as air: But the Voices grow louder and louder, And bellow, and bluster, and blare. They bristle before him and after, They flutter above and below, Shrill shriekings of lubberly laughter, Weird wailings of woe! They echo without him, within him: They thrill through his whiskers and beard: Like a teetotum seeming to spin him, With sneers never hitherto sneered. “Avengement,” they cry, “on our Foelet! Let the Manikin weep for our wrongs! Let us drench him, from toplet to toelet, With Nursery-Songs! “He shall muse upon ‘Hey! Diddle! Diddle!’ On the Cow that surmounted the Moon: He shall rave of the Cat and the Fiddle, And the Dish that eloped with the Spoon: And his soul shall be sad for the Spider, When Miss Muffet was sipping her whey, That so tenderly sat down beside her, And scared her away! “The music of Midsummer-madness Shall sting him with many a bite, Till, in rapture of rollicking sadness, He shall groan with a gloomy delight: He shall swathe him, like mists of the morning, In platitudes luscious and limp, Such as deck, with a deathless adorning, The Song of the Shrimp! “When the Ducklet's dark doom is decided, We will trundle him home in a trice: And the banquet, so plainly provided, Shall round into rose-buds and rice: In a blaze of pragmatic invention He shall wrestle with Fate, and shall reign: But he has not a friend fit to mention, So hit him again!” He has shot it, the delicate darling! And the Voices have ceased from their strife: Not a whisper of sneering or snarling, As he carries it home to his wife: Then, cheerily champing the bunlet His spouse was so skilful to bake, He hies him once more to the runlet, To fetch her the Drake! Chapter XIX A Fairy-Duet [“Say, what is the spell, when her fledgelings are cheeping] “Say, what is the spell, when her fledgelings are cheeping, That lures the bird home to her nest? Or wakes the tired mother, whose infant is weeping, To cuddle and croon it to rest? What's the magic that charms the glad babe in her arms, Till it cooes with the voice of the dove?” “'Tis a secret, and so let us whisper it low— And the name of the secret is Love!” “For I think it is Love, For I feel it is Love, For I'm sure it is nothing but Love!” “Say, whence is the voice that, when anger is burning, Bids the whirl of the tempest to cease? That stirs the vexed soul with an aching—a yearning For the brotherly hand-grip of peace? Whence the music that fills all our being—that thrills Around us, beneath, and above?” “'Tis a secret: none knows how it comes, how it goes: But the name of the secret is Love!” “For I think it is Love, For I feel it is Love, For I'm sure it is nothing but Love!” “Say whose is the skill that paints valley and hill, Like a picture so fair to the sight? That flecks the green meadow with sunshine and shadow, Till the little lambs leap with delight?” “'Tis a secret untold to hearts cruel and cold, Though 'tis sung, by the angels above, In notes that ring clear for the ears that can hear— And the name of the secret is Love!” “For I think it is Love, For I feel it is Love, For I'm sure it is nothing but Love!” Chapter XX Gammon and Spinach [“He looked again, and found it was] “He looked again, and found it was A Double Rule of Three: ‘And all its Mystery,’ he said, ‘Is clear as day to me!’” “He thought he saw an Argument That proved he was the Pope: He looked again, and found it was A Bar of Mottled Soap. ‘A fact so dread,’ he faintly said, ‘Extinguishes all hope!’” Chapter XXIII The Pig-Tale [Little Birds are dining] Little Birds are dining Warily and well, Hid in mossy cell: Hid, I say, by waiters Gorgeous in their gaiters— I've a Tale to tell. Little Birds are feeding Justices with jam, Rich in frizzled ham: Rich, I say, in oysters Haunting shady cloisters— That is what I am. Little Birds are teaching Tigresses to smile, Innocent of guile: Smile, I say, not smirkle— Mouth a semicircle, That's the proper style. Little Birds are sleeping All among the pins, Where the loser wins: Where, I say, he sneezes When and how he pleases— So the Tale begins. There was a Pig that sat alone Beside a ruined Pump: By day and night he made his moan— It would have stirred a heart of stone To see him wring his hoofs and groan, Because he could not jump. A certain Camel heard him shout— A Camel with a hump. “Oh, is it Grief, or is it Gout? What is this bellowing about?” That Pig replied, with quivering snout, “Because I cannot jump!” That Camel scanned him, dreamy-eyed. “Methinks you are too plump. I never knew a Pig so wide— That wobbled so from side to side— Who could, however much he tried, Do such a thing as jump! “Yet mark those trees, two miles away, All clustered in a clump: If you could trot there twice a day, Nor ever pause for rest or play, In the far future—Who can say?— You may be fit to jump.” That Camel passed, and left him there, Beside the ruined Pump. Oh, horrid was that Pig's despair! His shrieks of anguish filled the air. He wrung his hoofs, he rent his hair, Because he could not jump. There was a Frog that wandered by— A sleek and shining lump: Inspected him with fishy eye, And said “O Pig, what makes you cry?” And bitter was that Pig's reply, “Because I cannot jump!” That Frog he grinned a grin of glee, And hit his chest a thump. “O Pig,” he said, “be ruled by me, And you shall see what you shall see. This minute, for a trifling fee, I'll teach you how to jump! “You may be faint from many a fall, And bruised by many a bump: But, if you persevere through all, And practise first on something small, Concluding with a ten-foot wall, You'll find that you can jump!” That Pig looked up with joyful start: “Oh Frog, you are a trump! Your words have healed my inward smart— Come, name your fee and do your part: Bring comfort to a broken heart, By teaching me to jump!” “My fee shall be a mutton-chop, My goal this ruined Pump. Observe with what an airy flop I plant myself upon the top! Now bend your knees and take a hop, For that's the way to jump!” Uprose that Pig, and rushed, full whack, Against the ruined Pump: Rolled over like an empty sack, And settled down upon his back, While all his bones at once went “Crack!” It was a fatal jump. Little Birds are writing Interesting books, To be read by cooks: Read, I say, not roasted— Letterpress, when toasted, Loses its good looks. Little Birds are playing Bagpipes on the shore, Where the tourists snore: “Thanks!” they cry. ‘'Tis thrilling! Take, oh take this shilling! Let us have no more!” Little Birds are bathing Crocodiles in cream, Like a happy dream: Like, but not so lasting— Crocodiles, when fasting, Are not all they seem! That Camel passed, as Day grew dim Around the ruined Pump. “O broken heart! O broken limb! It needs,” that Camel said to him, “Something more fairy-like and slim, To execute a jump!” That Pig lay still as any stone, And could not stir a stump: Nor ever, if the truth were known, Was he again observed to moan, Nor ever wring his hoofs and groan, Because he could not jump. That Frog made no remark, for he Was dismal as a dump: He knew the consequence must be That he would never get his fee— And still he sits, in miserie, Upon that ruined Pump! Little Birds are choking Baronets with bun, Taught to fire a gun: Taught, I say, to splinter Salmon in the winter— Merely for the fun. Little Birds are hiding Crimes in carpet-bags, Blessed by happy stags: Blessed, I say, though beaten— Since our friends are eaten When the memory flags. Little Birds are tasting Gratitude and gold, Pale with sudden cold Pale, I say, and wrinkled— When the bells have tinkled, And the Tale is told.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">V Verse INSCRIBED TO A DEAR CHILD: IN MEMORY OF GOLDEN SUMMER HOURS AND WHISPERS OF A SUMMER SEA Girt with a boyish garb for boyish task, Eager she wields her spade: yet loves as well Rest on a friendly knee, intent to ask The tale he loves to tell. Rude spirits of the seething outer strife, Unmeet to read her pure and simple spright, Deem, if you list, such hours a waste of life, Empty of all delight! Chat on, sweet Maid, and rescue from annoy Hearts that by wiser talk are unbeguiled. Ah, happy he who owns that tenderest joy, The heart-love of a child! Away, fond thoughts, and vex my soul no more! Work claims my wakeful nights, my busy days— Albeit bright memories of that sunlit shore Yet haunt my dreaming gaze! THE HUNTING OF THE SNARK Fit the First The Landing “Just the place for a Snark!” the Bellman cried, As he landed his crew with care; Supporting each man on the top of the tide By a finger entwined in his hair. “Just the place for a Snark! I have said it twice: That alone should encourage the crew. Just the place for a Snark! I have said it thrice: What I tell you three times is true.” The crew was complete: it included a Boots— A maker of Bonnets and Hoods— A Barrister, brought to arrange their disputes— And a Broker, to value their goods. A Billiard-marker, whose skill was immense, Might perhaps have won more than his share— But a Banker, engaged at enormous expense, Had the whole of their cash in his care. There was also a Beaver, that paced on the deck, Or would sit making lace in the bow: And had often (the Bellman said) saved them from wreck Though none of the sailors knew how. There was one who was famed for the number of things He forgot when he entered the ship: His umbrella, his watch, all his jewels and rings, And the clothes he had bought for the trip. He had forty-two boxes, all carefully packed, With his name painted clearly on each: But, since he omitted to mention the fact, They were all left behind on the beach. The loss of his clothes hardly mattered, because He had seven coats on when he came, With three pair of boots—but the worst of it was, He had wholly forgotten his name. He would answer to “Hi!” or to any loud cry, Such as “Fry me!” or “Fritter my wig!” To “What-you-may-call-um!” or “What-was-his-name!” But especially “Thing-um-a-jig!” While, for those who preferred a more forcible word, He had different names from these: His intimate friends called him “Candle-ends,” And his enemies “Toasted-cheese.” “His form is ungainly—his intellect small—” (So the Bellman would often remark)— “But his courage is perfect! And that, after all, Is the thing that one needs with a Snark.” He would joke with hyænas, returning their stare With an impudent wag of the head: And he once went a walk, paw-in-paw, with a bear, “Just to keep up its spirits,” he said. He came as a Baker: but owned, when too late— And it drove the poor Bellman half-mad— He could only bake Bride-cake—for which, I may state, No materials were to be had. The last of the crew needs especial remark, Though he looked an incredible dunce: He had just one idea—but, that one being “Snark,” The good Bellman engaged him at once. He came as a Butcher: but gravely declared, When the ship had been sailing a week, He could only kill Beavers. The Bellman looked scared, And was almost too frightened to speak: But at length he explained, in a tremulous tone, There was only one Beaver on board; And that was a tame one he had of his own, Whose death would be deeply deplored. The Beaver, who happened to hear the remark, Protested, with tears in its eyes, That not even the rapture of hunting the Snark Could atone for that dismal surprise! It strongly advised that the Butcher should be Conveyed in a separate ship: But the Bellman declared that would never agree With the plans he had made for the trip: Navigation was always a difficult art, Though with only one ship and one bell: And he feared he must really decline, for his part, Undertaking another as well. The Beaver's best course was, no doubt, to procure A second-hand dagger-proof coat— So the Baker advised it—and next, to insure Its life in some Office of note: This the Banker suggested, and offered for hire (On moderate terms), or for sale, Two excellent Policies, one Against Fire And one Against Damage From Hail. Yet still, ever after that sorrowful day, Whenever the Butcher was by, The Beaver kept looking the opposite way, And appeared unaccountably shy. Fit the Second The Bellman's Speech The Bellman himself they all praised to the skies— Such a carriage, such ease and such grace! Such solemnity, too! One could see he was wise, The moment one looked in his face! He had bought a large map representing the sea, Without the least vestige of land: And the crew were much pleased when they found it to be A map they could all understand. “What's the good of Mercator's North Poles and Equators, Tropics, Zones, and Meridian Lines?” So the Bellman would cry: and the crew would reply “They are merely conventional signs! “Other maps are such shapes, with their islands and capes! But we've got our brave Captain to thank” (So the crew would protest) “that he's bought us the best— A perfect and absolute blank!” This was charming, no doubt: but they shortly found out That the Captain they trusted so well Had only one notion for crossing the ocean, And that was to tingle his bell. He was thoughtful and grave—but the orders he gave Were enough to bewilder a crew. When he cried “Steer to starboard, but keep her head larboard!” What on earth was the helmsman to do? Then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes A thing, as the Bellman remarked, That frequently happens in tropical climes, When a vessel is, so to speak, “snarked.” But the principal failing occurred in the sailing, And the Bellman, perplexed and distressed, Said he had hoped, at least, when the wind blew due East, That the ship would not travel due West! But the danger was past—they had landed at last, With their boxes, portmanteaus, and bags: Yet at first sight the crew were not pleased with the view Which consisted of chasms and crags. The Bellman perceived that their spirits were low, And repeated in musical tone Some jokes he had kept for a season of woe— But the crew would do nothing but groan. He served out some grog with a liberal hand, And bade them sit down on the beach: And they could not but own that their Captain looked grand, As he stood and delivered his speech. “Friends, Romans, and countrymen, lend me your ears!” (They were all of them fond of quotations: So they drank to his health, and they gave him three cheers, While he served out additional rations). “We have sailed many months, we have sailed many weeks, (Four weeks to the month you may mark), But never as yet ('tis your Captain who speaks) Have we caught the least glimpse of a Snark! “We have sailed many weeks, we have sailed many days, (Seven days to the week I allow), But a Snark, on the which we might lovingly gaze, We have never beheld till now! ‘Come, listen, my men, while I tell you again The five unmistakable marks By which you may know, wheresoever you go, The warranted genuine Snarks. “Let us take them in order. The first is the taste, Which is meagre and hollow, but crisp: Like a coat that is rather too tight in the waist, With a flavour of Will-o'-the-Wisp. “Its habit of getting up late you'll agree That it carries too far, when I say That it frequently breakfasts at five-o'clock tea, And dines on the following day. “The third is its slowness in taking a jest. Should you happen to venture on one, It will sigh like a thing that is deeply distressed: And it always looks grave at a pun. “The fourth is its fondness for bathing-machines, Which it constantly carries about, And believes that they add to the beauty of scenes— A sentiment open to doubt. “The fifth is ambition. It next will be right To describe each particular batch: Distinguishing those that have feathers, and bite, From those that have whiskers, and scratch. “For, although common Snarks do no manner of harm, Yet I feel it my duty to say Some are Boojums—” The Bellman broke off in alarm, For the Baker had fainted away. Fit the Third The Baker's Tale They roused him with muffins—they roused him with ice— They roused him with mustard and cress— They roused him with jam and judicious advice— They set him conundrums to guess. When at length he sat up and was able to speak, His sad story he offered to tell; And the Bellman cried “Silence! Not even a shriek!” And excitedly tingled his bell. There was silence supreme! Not a shriek, not a scream, Scarcely even a howl or a groan, As the man they called “Ho!” told his story of woe In an antediluvian tone. “My father and mother were honest, though poor—” “Skip all that!” cried the Bellman in haste. “If it once becomes dark, there's no chance of a Snark— We have hardly a minute to waste!” “I skip forty years,” said the Baker in tears, “And proceed without further remark To the day when you took me aboard of your ship To help you in hunting the Snark. “A dear uncle of mine (after whom I was named) Remarked, when I bade him farewell—” “Oh, skip your dear uncle!” the Bellman exclaimed, As he angrily tingled his bell. “He remarked to me then,” said that mildest of men, “‘If your Snark be a Snark, that is right: Fetch it home by all means—you may serve it with greens And it's handy for striking a light. “‘You may seek it with thimbles—and seek it with care You may hunt it with forks and hope; You may threaten its life with a railway-share; You may charm it with smiles and soap—’” (“That's exactly the method,” the Bellman bold In a hasty parenthesis cried, “That's exactly the way I have always been told That the capture of Snarks should be tried!”) “‘But oh, beamish nephew, beware of the day, If your Snark be a Boojum! For then You will softly and suddenly vanish away, And never be met with again!’ “It is this, it is this that oppresses my soul, When I think of my uncle's last words: And my heart is like nothing so much as a bowl Brimming over with quivering curds! “It is this, it is this—” “We have had that before!” The Bellman indignantly said. And the Baker replied “Let me say it once more. It is this, it is this that I dread! “I engage with the Snark—every night after dark— In a dreamy delirious fight: I serve it with greens in those shadowy scenes, And I use it for striking a light: “But if ever I meet with a Boojum, that day, In a moment (of this I am sure), I shall softly and suddenly vanish away— And the notion I cannot endure!” Fit the Fourth The Hunting The Bellman looked uffish, and wrinkled his brow. “If only you'd spoken before! It's excessively awkward to mention it now, With the Snark, so to speak, at the door! “We should all of us grieve, as you well may believe, If you never were met with again— But surely, my man, when the voyage began, You might have suggested it then? “It's excessively awkward to mention it now— As I think I've already remarked.” And the man they called “Hi!” replied, with a sigh, “I informed you the day we embarked. “You may charge me with murder—or want of sense— (We are all of us weak at times): But the slightest approach to a false pretence Was never among my crimes! “I said it in Hebrew—I said it in Dutch— I said it in German and Greek: But I wholly forgot (and it vexes me much) That English is what you speak!” “'Tis a pitiful tale,” said the Bellman, whose face Had grown longer at every word: “But, now that you've stated the whole of your case, More debate would be simply absurd. “The rest of my speech” (he exclaimed to his men) “You shall hear when I've leisure to speak it. But the Snark is at hand, let me tell you again! 'Tis your glorious duty to seek it! “To seek it with thimbles, to seek it with care; To pursue it with forks and hope; To threaten its life with a railway-share; To charm it with smiles and soap! “For the Snark's a peculiar creature, that won't Be caught in a commonplace way. Do all that you know, and try all that you don't: Not a chance must be wasted to-day! “For England expects—I forbear to proceed: 'Tis a maxim tremendous, but trite: And you'd best be unpacking the things that you need To rig yourselves out for the fight.” Then the Banker endorsed a blank cheque (which he crossed), And changed his loose silver for notes: The Baker with care combed his whiskers and hair. And shook the dust out of his coats: The Boots and the Broker were sharpening a spade— Each working the grindstone in turn: But the Beaver went on making lace, and displayed No interest in the concern: Though the Barrister tried to appeal to its pride, And vainly proceeded to cite A number of cases, in which making laces Had been proved an infringement of right. The maker of Bonnets ferociously planned A novel arrangement of bows: While the Billiard-marker with quivering hand Was chalking the tip of his nose. But the Butcher turned nervous, and dressed himself fine, With yellow kid gloves and a ruff— Said he felt it exactly like going to dine, Which the Bellman declared was all “stuff.” “Introduce me, now there's a good fellow,” he said, “If we happen to meet it together!” And the Bellman, sagaciously nodding his head, Said “That must depend on the weather.” The Beaver went simply galumphing about, At seeing the Butcher so shy: And even the Baker, though stupid and stout, Made an effort to wink with one eye. “Be a man!” cried the Bellman in wrath, as he heard The Butcher beginning to sob. “Should we meet with a Jubjub, that desperate bird, We shall need all our strength for the job!” Fit the Fifth The Beaver's Lesson They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care; They pursued it with forks and hope; They threatened its life with a railway-share; They charmed it with smiles and soap. Then the Butcher contrived an ingenious plan For making a separate sally; And had fixed on a spot unfrequented by man, A dismal and desolate valley. But the very same plan to the Beaver occurred: It had chosen the very same place: Yet neither betrayed, by a sign or a word, The disgust that appeared in his face. Each thought he was thingking of nothing but “Snark” And the glorious work of the day; And each tried to pretend that he did not remark That the other was going that way. But the valley grew narrow and narrower still, And the evening got darker and colder, Till (merely from nervousness, not from good will) They marched along shoulder to shoulder. Then a scream, shrill and high, rent the shuddering sky And they knew that some danger was near: The Beaver turned pale to the tip of its tail, And even the Butcher felt queer. He thought of his childhood, left far behind— That blissful and innocent state— The sound so exactly recalled to his mind A pencil that squeaks on a slate! “'Tis the voice of the Jubjub!” he suddenly cried. (This man, that they used to call “Dunce.”) “As the Bellman would tell you,” he added with pride, “I have uttered that sentiment once. “'Tis the note of the Jubjub! Keep count, I entreat. You will find I have told it you twice. 'Tis the song of the Jubjub! The proof is complete. If only I've stated it thrice.” The Beaver had counted with scrupulous care, Attending to every word: But it fairly lost heart, and outgrabe in despair, When the third repetition occurred. It felt that, in spite of all possible pains, It had somehow contrived to lose count, And the only thing now was to rack its poor brains By reckoning up the amount. ‘Two added to one—if that could but be done,” It said, “with one's fingers and thumbs!” Recollecting with tears how, in earlier years, It had taken no pains with its sums. “The thing can be done,” said the Butcher, “I think The thing must be done, I am sure. The thing shall be done! Bring me paper and ink, The best there is time to procure.” The Beaver brought paper, portfolio, pens, And ink in unfailing supplies: While strange creepy creatures came out of their dens, And watched them with wondering eyes. So engrossed was the Butcher, he heeded them not, As he wrote with a pen in each hand, And explained all the while in a popular style Which the Beaver could well understand. “Taking Three as the subject to reason about— A convenient number to state— We add Seven, and Ten, and then multiply out By One Thousand diminished by Eight. “The result we proceed to divide, as you see, By Nine Hundred and Ninety and Two: Then subtract Seventeen, and the answer must be Exactly and perfectly true. “The method employed I would gladly explain, While I have it so clear in my head, If I had but the time and you had but the brain— But much yet remains to be said. “In one moment I've seen what has hitherto been Enveloped in absolute mystery, And without extra charge I will give you at large A Lesson in Natural History.” In his genial way he proceeded to say (Forgetting all laws of propriety, And that giving instruction, without introduction, Would have caused quite a thrill in Society), “As to temper the Jubjub's a desperate bird. Since it lives in perpetual passion: Its taste in costume is entirely absurd— It is ages ahead of the fashion: “But it knows any friend it has met once before: It never will look at a bribe: And in charity-meetings it stands at the door, And collects—though it does not subscribe. “Its flavour when cooked is more exquisite far Than mutton, or oysters, or eggs: (Some think it keeps best in an ivory jar, And some, in mahogany kegs:) “You boil it in sawdust: you salt it in glue: You condense it with locusts and tape: Still keeping one principal object in view— To preserve its symmetrical shape.” The Butcher would gladly have talked till next day, But he felt that the Lesson must end, And he wept with delight in attempting to say He considered the Beaver his friend: While the Beaver confessed, with affectionate looks More eloquent even than tears, It had learned in ten minutes far more than all books Would have taught it in seventy years. They returned hand-in-hand, and the Bellman, unmanned (For a moment) with noble emotion, Said “This amply repays all the wearisome days We have spent on the billowy ocean!” Such friends, as the Beaver and Butcher became, Have seldom if ever been known; In winter or summer, 'twas always the same— You could never meet either alone. And when quarrels arose—as one frequently finds Quarrels will, spite of every endeavour— The song of the Jubjub recurred to their minds, And cemented their friendship for ever! Fit the Sixth The Barrister's Dream They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care; They pursued it with forks and hope; They threatened its life with a railway-share; They charmed it with smiles and soap. But the Barrister, weary of proving in vain That the Beaver's lace-making was wrong, Fell asleep, and in dreams saw the creature quite plain That his fancy had dwelt on so long. He dreamed that he stood in a shadowy Court, Where the Snark, with a glass in its eye, Dressed in gown, bands, and wig, was defending a pig On the charge of deserting its sty. The Witnesses proved, without error or flaw, That the sty was deserted when found: And the Judge kept explaining the state of the law In a soft under-current of sound. The indictment had never been clearly expressed, And it seemed that the Snark had begun, And had spoken three hours, before any one guessed What the pig was supposed to have done. The Jury had each formed a different view (Long before the indictment was read), And they all spoke at once, so that none of them knew One word that the others had said. “You must know—” said the Judge: but the Snark exclaimed “Fudge! That statute is obsolete quite! Let me tell you, my friends, the whole question depends On an ancient manorial right. ‘In the matter of Treason the pig would appear To have aided, but scarcely abetted: While the charge of Insolvency fails, it is clear, If you grant the plea ‘never indebted.’ “The fact of Desertion I will not dispute: But its guilt, as I trust, is removed (So far as relates to the costs of this suit) By the Alibi which has been proved. “My poor client's fate now depends on your votes.” Here the speaker sat down in his place, And directed the Judge to refer to his notes And briefly to sum up the case. But the Judge said he never had summed up before; So the Snark undertook it instead, And summed it so well that it came to far more Than the Witnesses ever had said! When the verdict was called for, the Jury declined, As the word was so puzzling to spell; But they ventured to hope that the Snark wouldn't mind Undertaking that duty as well. So the Snark found the verdict, although, as it owned, It was spent with the toils of the day: When it said the word “GUILTY!” the Jury all groaned And some of them fainted away. Then the Snark pronounced sentence, the Judge being quite Too nervous to utter a word: When it rose to its feet, there was silence like night, And the fall of a pin might be heard. “Transportation for life” was the sentence it gave, “And then to be fined forty pound.” The Jury all cheered, though the Judge said he feared That the phrase was not legally sound. But their wild exultation was suddenly checked When the jailer informed them, with tears, Such a sentence would have not the slightest effect, As the pig had been dead for some years. The Judge left the Court, looking deeply disgusted But the Snark, though a little aghast, As the lawyer to whom the defence was intrusted, Went bellowing on to the last. Thus the Barrister dreamed, while the bellowing seemed To grow every moment more clear: Till he woke to the knell of a furious bell, Which the Bellman rang close at his ear. Fit the Seventh The Banker's Fate They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care; They pursued it with forks and hope; They threatened its life with a railway-share; They charmed it with smiles and soap. And the Banker, inspired with a courage so new It was matter for general remark, Rushed madly ahead and was lost to their view In his zeal to discover the Snark. But while he was seeking with thimbles and care, A Bandersnatch swiftly drew nigh And grabbed at the Banker, who shrieked in despair, For he knew it was useless to fly. He offered large discount—he offered a cheque (Drawn “to bearer”) for seven-pounds-ten: But the Bandersnatch merely extended its neck And grabbed at the Banker again. Without rest or pause—while those frumious jaws Went savagely snapping around— He skipped and he hopped, and he floundered and flopped, Till fainting he fell to the ground. The Bandersnatch fled as the others appeared Led on by that fear-stricken yell: And the Bellman remarked “It is just as I feared!” And solemnly tolled on his bell. He was black in the face, and they scarcely could trace The least likeness to what he had been: While so great was his fright that his waistcoat turned white— A wonderful thing to be seen! To the horror of all who were present that day, He uprose in full evening dress, And with senseless grimaces endeavoured to say What his tongue could no longer express. Down he sank in a chair—ran his hands through his hair— And chanted in mimsiest tones Words whose utter inanity proved his insanity, While he rattled a couple of bones. “Leave him here to his fate—it is getting so late!” The Bellman exclaimed in a fright. ‘We have lost half the day. Any further delay, And we sha'n't catch a Snark before night!” Fit the Eighth The Vanishing They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care; They pursued it with forks and hope; They threatened its life with a railway-share; They charmed it with smiles and soap. They shuddered to think that the chase might fail, And the Beaver, excited at last, Went bounding along on the tip of its tail, For the daylight was nearly past. “There is Thingumbob shouting!” the Bellman said. “He is shouting like mad, only hark! He is waving his hands, he is wagging his head, He has certainly found a Snark!” They gazed in delight, while the Butcher exclaimed “He was always a desperate wag!” They beheld him—their Baker—their hero unnamed— On the top of a neighbouring crag, Erect and sublime, for one moment of time, In the next, that wild figure they saw (As if stung by a spasm) plunge into a chasm, While they waited and listened in awe. “It's a Snark!” was the sound that first came to their ears, And seemed almost too good to be true. Then followed a torrent of laughter and cheers: Then the ominous words “It's a Boo—” Then, silence. Some fancied they heard in the air A weary and wandering sigh That sounded like “—jum!” but the others declare It was only a breeze that went by. They hunted till darkness came on, but they found Not a button, or feather, or mark, By which they could tell that they stood on the ground Where the Baker had met with the Snark. In the midst of the word he was trying to say, In the midst of his laughter and glee, He had softly and suddenly vanished away— For the Snark was a Boojum, you see.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EARLY VERSE MY FAIRY (1845) I have a fairy by my side Which says I must not sleep, When once in pain I loudly cried It said “You must not weep.” If, full of mirth, I smile and grin, It says “You must not laugh;” When once I wished to drink some gin It said “You must not quaff.” When once a meal I wished to taste It said “You must not bite;” When to the wars I went in haste It said “You must not fight.” “What may I do?” at length I cried, Tired of the painful task. The fairy quietly replied, And said “You must not ask.” Moral: “You mustn't.” PUNCTUALITY Man naturally loves delay, And to procrastinate; Business put off from day to day Is always done too late. Let every hour be in its place Firm fixed, nor loosely shift, And well enjoy the vacant space, As though a birthday gift. And when the hour arrives, be there, Where'er that “there” may be; Uncleanly hands or ruffled hair Let no one ever see. If dinner at “half-past” be placed, At “half-past” then be dressed. If at a “quarter-past” make haste To be down with the rest. Better to be before your time, Than e'er to be behind; To ope the door while strikes the chime, That shows a punctual mind. Moral Let punctuality and care Seize every flitting hour, So shalt thou cull a floweret fair, E'en from a fading flower. MELODIES I There was an old farmer of Readall, Who made holes in his face with a needle, Then went far deeper in Than to pierce through the skin, And yet strange to say he was made beadle. II There was an eccentric old draper, Who wore a hat made of brown paper, It went up to a point, Yet it looked out of joint, The cause of which he said was “vapour.” III There was once a young man of Oporta, Who daily got shorter and shorter, The reason he said Was the hod on his head, Which was filled with the heaviest mortar. His sister, named Lucy O'Finner, Grew constantly thinner and thinner; The reason was plain, She slept out in the rain, And was never allowed any dinner. BROTHER AND SISTER “Sister, sister, go to bed! Go and rest your weary head.” Thus the prudent brother said. “Do you want a battered hide, Or scratches to your face applied?” Thus his sister calm replied. “Sister, do not raise my wrath. I'd make you into mutton broth As easily as kill a moth!” The sister raised her beaming eye And looked on him indignantly And sternly answered, “Only try!” Off to the cook he quickly ran. “Dear Cook, please lend a frying-pan To me as quickly as you can.” “And wherefore should I lend it you?” “The reason, Cook, is plain to view. I wish to make an Irish stew.” “What meat is in that stew to go?” “My sister'll be the contents!” “Oh!” “You'll lend the pan to me, Cook?” “No!” Moral: Never stew your sister. FACTS Were I to take an iron gun, And fire it off towards the sun; I grant 'twould reach its mark at last, But not till many years had passed. But should that bullet change its force, And to the planets take its course, 'Twould never reach the nearest star, Because it is so very far.

HORRORS (1850) Methought I walked a dismal place Dim horrors all around; The air was thick with many a face, And black as night the ground. I saw a monster come with speed, Its face of grimmliest green, On human beings used to feed, Most dreadful to be seen. I could not speak, I could not fly, I fell down in that place, I saw the monster's horrid eye Come leering in my face! Amidst my scarcely-stifled groans, Amidst my moanings deep, I heard a voice, “Wake! Mr. Jones, You're screaming in your sleep!” MISUNDERSTANDINGS If such a thing had been my thought, I should have told you so before, But as I didn't, then you ought To ask for such a thing no more, For to teach one who has been taught Is always thought an awful bore. Now to commence my argument, I shall premise an observation, On which the greatest kings have leant When striving to subdue a nation, And e'en the wretch who pays no rent By it can solve a hard equation. Its truth is such, the force of reason Can not avail to shake its power, Yet e'en the sun in summer season Doth not dispel so mild a shower As this, and he who sees it, sees on Beyond it to a sunny bower— No more, when ignorance is treason, Let wisdom's brows be cold and sour. AS IT FELL UPON A DAY As I was sitting on the hearth (And O, but a hog is fat!) A man came hurrying up the path, (And what care I for that?) When he came the house unto, His breath both quick and short he drew. When he came before the door, His face grew paler than before. When he turned the handle round, The man fell fainting to the ground. When he crossed the lofty hall, Once and again I heard him fall. When he came up to the turret stair, He shrieked and tore his raven hair. When he came my chamber in, (And O, but a hog is fat!) I ran him through with a golden pin, (And what care I for that?)

LAYS OF SORROW No. 1 The day was wet, the rain fell souse Like jars of strawberry jam, I.e. the jam without the jars. Observe the beauty of this rhyme. a Sound was heard in the old henhouse, A beating of a hammer. Of stalwart form, and visage warm, Two youths were seen within it, Splitting up an old tree into perches for their poultry At a hundred strokes At the rate of a stroke and two-thirds in a second. a minute. The work is done, the hen has taken Possession of her nest and eggs, Without a thought of eggs and bacon, Unless the hen was a poacher, which is unlikely. (Or I am very much mistaken:) She turns over each shell, To be sure that all's well, Looks into the straw To see there's no flaw, Goes once round the house, The henhouse. Half afraid of a mouse, Then sinks calmly to rest On the top of her nest, First doubling up each of her legs. Time rolled away, and so did every shell, “Small by degrees and beautifully less,” As the sage mother with a powerful spell Beak and claw. Forced each in turn its contents to express, Press out. But ah! “imperfect is expression,” Some poet said, I don't care who, If you want to know you must go elsewhere, One fact I can tell, if you're willing to hear, He never attended a Parliament Session, For I'm certain that if he had ever been there, Full quickly would he have changed his ideas, With the hissings, the hootings, the groans and the cheers. And as to his name it is pretty clear That it wasn't me and it wasn't you! And so it fell upon a day, (That is, it never rose again) A chick was found upon the hay, Its little life had ebbed away. No longer frolicsome and gay, No longer could it run or play. “And must we, chicken, must we part?” Its master Probably one of the two stalwart youths. cried with bursting heart, And voice of agony and pain. So one, whose ticket's marked “Return,” The system of return tickets is an excellent one. People are conveyed, on particular days, there and back again for one fare. When to the lonely roadside station He flies in fear and perturbation, Thinks of his home—the hissing urn— Then runs with flying hat and hair, And, entering, finds to his despair He's missed the very latest train. An additional vexation would be that his “Return” ticket would be no use the next day. Too long it were to tell of each conjecture Of chicken suicide, and poultry victim, The deadly frown, the stern and dreary lecture, The timid guess, “perhaps some needle pricked him!” The din of voice, the words both loud and many, The sob, the tear, the sigh that none could smother, Till all agreed “a shilling to a penny It killed itself, and we acquit the mother!” Scarce was the verdict spoken, When that still calm was broken, A childish form hath burst into the throng; With tears and looks of sadness, That bring no news of gladness, But tell too surely something hath gone wrong! “The sight that I have come upon The stoutest heart Perhaps even the “bursting” heart of its master. would sicken, That nasty hen has been and gone And killed another chicken!” LAYS OF SORROW No. 2 Fair stands the ancient This Rectory has been supposed to have been built in the time of Edward VI, but recent discoveries clearly assign its origin to a much earlier period. A stone has been found in an island formed by the river Tees on which is inscribed the letter “A,” which is justly conjectured to stand for the name of the great King Alfred, in whose reign this house was probably built. Rectory, The Rectory of Croft, The sun shines bright upon it, The breezes whisper soft. From all the house and garden, Its inhabitants come forth, And muster in the road without, And pace in twos and threes about, The children of the North. Some are waiting in the garden, Some are waiting at the door, And some are following behind, And some have gone before. But wherefore all this mustering? Wherefore this vast array? A gallant feat of horsemanship Will be performed to-day. To eastward and to westward, The crowd divides amain, Two youths are leading on the steed, Both tugging at the rein; And sorely do they labour, For the steed The poet entreats pardon for having represented a donkey under this dignified name. is very strong, And backward moves its stubborn feet, And backward ever doth retreat, And drags its guides along. And now the knight hath mounted, Before the admiring band, Hath got the stirrups on his feet, The bridle in his hand. Yet, oh! beware, sir horseman! And tempt thy fate no more, For such a steed as thou hast got Was never rid before! The rabbits bow before thee, And cower in the straw; The chickens A full account of the history and misfortunes of these interesting creatures may be found in the first “Lay of Sorrow.” are submissive, And own thy will for law; Bullfinches and canary Thy bidding do obey; And e'en the tortoise in its shell Doth never say thee nay. But thy steed will hear no master, Thy steed will bear no stick, And woe to those that beat her, And woe to those that kick! It is a singular fact that a donkey makes a point of returning any kicks offered to it. For though her rider smite her, As hard as he can hit, And strive to turn her from the yard, She stands in silence, pulling hard Against the pulling bit. And now the road to Dalton Hath felt their coming tread, The crowd are speeding on before, And all have gone ahead. Yet often look they backward, And cheer him on, and bawl, For slower still, and still more slow, That horseman and that charger go, And scarce advance at all. And now two roads to choose from Are in that rider's sight: In front the road to Dalton, And New Croft upon the right. “I can't get by!” he bellows, “I really am not able! Though I pull my shoulder out of joint, I cannot get him past this point, For it leads unto his stable!” Then out spake Ulfrid Longbow, This valiant knight, besides having a heart of steel and nerves of iron, has been lately in the habit of carrying a brick in his eye. A valiant youth was he, “Lo! I will stand on thy right hand And guard the pass for thee!” And out spake fair Flureeza, She was sister to both. His sister eke was she, “I will abide on thy other side, And turn thy steed for thee!” And now commenced a struggle Between that steed and rider, For all the strength that he hath left Doth not suffice to guide her. Though Ulfrid and his sister Have kindly stopped the way, And all the crowd have cried aloud, “We can't wait here all day!” Round turned he as not deigning Their words to understand, But he slipped the stirrups from his feet The bridle from his hand, And grasped the mane full lightly, And vaulted from his seat, And gained the road in triumph, The reader will probably be at a loss to discover the nature of this triumph, as no object was gained, and the donkey was obviously the victor; on this point, however, we are sorry to say we can offer no good explanation. And stood upon his feet. All firmly till that moment Had Ulfrid Longbow stood, And faced the foe right valiantly, As every warrior should. But when safe on terra firma His brother he did spy, “What did you do that for?” he cried, Then unconcerned he stepped aside And let it canter by. They gave him bread and butter, Much more acceptable to a true knight than “corn-land” which the Roman people were so foolish as to give to their daring champion, Horatius. That was of public right, As much as four strong rabbits Could munch from morn to night, For he'd done a deed of daring, And faced that savage steed, And therefore cups of coffee sweet, And everything that was a treat, Were but his right and meed. And often in the evenings, When the fire is blazing bright, When books bestrew the table And moths obscure the light, When crying children go to bed, A struggling, kicking load; We'll talk of Ulfrid Longbow's deed, How, in his brother's utmost need, Back to his aid he flew with speed, And how he faced the fiery steed, And kept the New Croft Road. THE TWO BROTHERS (1853) There were two brothers at Twyford school, And when they had left the place, It was, “Will ye learn Greek and Latin? Or will ye run me a race? Or will ye go up to yonder bridge, And there we will angle for dace?” “I'm too stupid for Greek and for Latin, I'm too lazy by half for a race, So I'll even go up to yonder bridge, And there we will angle for dace.” He has fitted together two joints of his rod, And to them he has added another, And then a great hook he took from his book, And ran it right into his brother. Oh much is the noise that is made among boys When playfully pelting a pig, But a far greater pother was made by his brother When flung from the top of the brigg. The fish hurried up by the dozens, All ready and eager to bite, For the lad that he flung was so tender and young, It quite gave them an appetite. Said he, “Thus shall he wallop about And the fish take him quite at their ease, For me to annoy it was ever his joy, Now I'll teach him the meaning of ‘Tees’!” The wind to his ear brought a voice, “My brother, you didn't had ought ter! And what have I done that you think it such fun To indulge in the pleasure of slaughter? “A good nibble or bite is my chiefest delight, When I'm merely expected to see, But a bite from a fish is not quite what I wish, When I get it performed upon me; And just now here's a swarm of dace at my arm, And a perch has got hold of my knee. “For water my thirst was not great at the first, And of fish I have quite sufficien—” “Oh fear not!” he cried, “for whatever betide, We are both in the selfsame condition! “I am sure that our state's very nearly alike (Not considering the question of slaughter), For I have my perch on the top of the bridge, And you have your perch in the water. “I stick to my perch and your perch sticks to you, We are really extremely alike; I've a turn-pike up here, and I very much fear You may soon have a turn with a pike.” “Oh grant but one wish! If I'm took by a fish (For your bait is your brother, good man!) Pull him up if you like, but I hope you will strike As gently as ever you can.” “If the fish be a trout, I'm afraid there's no doubt I must strike him like lightning that's greased; If the fish be a pike, I'll engage not to strike, Till I've waited ten minutes at least.” “But in those ten minutes to desolate Fate Your brother a victim may fall!” “I'll reduce it to five, so perhaps you'll survive, But the chance is exceedingly small.” “Oh hard is your heart for to act such a part; Is it iron, or granite, or steel?” “Why, I really can't say—it is many a day Since my heart was accustomed to feel. “'Twas my heart-cherished wish for to slay many fish Each day did my malice grow worse, For my heart didn't soften with doing it so often, But rather, I should say, the reverse.” “Oh would I were back at Twyford school, Learning lessons in fear of the birch!” “Nay, brother!” he cried, “for whatever betide, You are better off here with your perch! “I am sure you'll allow you are happier now, With nothing to do but to play; And this single line here, it is perfectly clear, Is much better than thirty a day! “And as to the rod hanging over your head, And apparently ready to fall, That, you know, was the case, when you lived in that place, So it need not be reckoned at all. “Do you see that old trout with a turn-up-nose snout? (Just to speak on a pleasanter theme,) Observe, my dear brother, our love for each other— He's the one I like best in the stream. “To-morrow I mean to invite him to dine (We shall all of us think it a treat); If the day should be fine, I'll just drop him a line, And we'll settle what time we're to meet. “He hasn't been into society yet, And his manners are not of the best, So I think it quite fair that it should be my care, To see that he's properly dressed.” Many words brought the wind of “cruel” and “kind,” And that “man suffers more than the brute”: Each several word with patience he heard, And answered with wisdom to boot. “What? prettier swimming in the stream, Than lying all snugly and flat? Do but look at that dish filled with glittering fish, Has Nature a picture like that? “What? a higher delight to be drawn from the sight Of fish full of life and of glee? What a noodle you are! 'tis delightfuller far To kill them than let them go free! “I know there are people who prate by the hour Of the beauty of earth, sky, and ocean; Of the birds as they fly, of the fish darting by, Rejoicing in Life and in Motion. “As to any delight to be got from the sight, It is all very well for a flat, But I think it all gammon, for hooking a salmon Is better than twenty of that! “They say that a man of a right-thinking mind Will love the dumb creatures he sees— What's the use of his mind, if he's never inclined To pull a fish out of the Tees? “Take my friends and my home—as an outcast I'll roam: Take the money I have in the Bank; It is just what I wish, but deprive me of fish, And my life would indeed be a blank!” Forth from the house his sister came, Her brothers for to see, But when she saw that sight of awe, The tear stood in her e'e. “Oh what bait's that upon your hook, My brother, tell to me?” “It is but the fantailed pigeon, He would not sing for me.” “Whoe'er would expect a pigeon to sing, A simpleton he must be! But a pigeon-cote is a different thing To the coat that there I see!” “Oh what bait's that upon your hook, Dear brother, tell to me?” “It is my younger brother,” he cried, “Oh woe and dole is me! “I's mighty wicked, that I is! Or how could such things be? Farewell, farewell, sweet sister, I'm going o'er the sea.” “And when will you come back again, My brother, tell to me?” “When chub is good for human food, And that will never be!” She turned herself right round about, And her heart brake into three, Said, “One of the two will be wet through and through, And t'other'll be late for his tea!” THE LADY OF THE LADLE (1854) The Youth at Eve had drunk his fill, Where stands the “Royal” on the Hill, And long his mid-day stroll had made, On the so-called “Marine Parade”— (Meant, I presume, for Seamen brave, Whose “march is on the Mountain wave”; 'Twere just the bathing-place for him Who stays on land till he can swim—) And he had strayed into the Town, And paced each alley up and down, Where still, so narrow grew the way, The very houses seemed to say, Nodding to friends across the Street, “One struggle more and we shall meet.” And he had scaled that wondrous stair That soars from earth to upper air, Where rich and poor alike must climb, And walk the treadmill for a time. That morning he had dressed with care, And put Pomatum on his hair; He was, the loungers all agreed, A very heavy swell indeed: Men thought him, as he swaggered by, Some scion of nobility, And never dreamed, so cold his look, That he had loved—and loved a Cook. Upon the beach he stood and sighed Unheedful of the treacherous tide; Thus sang he to the listening main, And soothed his sorrow with the strain! CORONACH “She is gone by the Hilda, She is lost unto Whitby, And her name is Matilda, Which my heart it was smit by; Tho' I take the Goliah, I learn to my sorrow That ‘it won't,’ said the crier, ‘Be off till to-morrow.’ “She called me her ‘Neddy,’ (Tho' there mayn't be much in it,) And I should have been ready, If she'd waited a minute; I was following behind her When, if you recollect, I Merely ran back to find a Gold pin for my neck-tie. “Rich dresser of suet! Prime hand at a sausage! I have lost thee, I rue it, And my fare for the passage! Perhaps she thinks it funny, Aboard of the Hilda, But I've lost purse and money, And thee, oh, my 'Tilda!” His pin of gold the youth undid And in his waistcoat-pocket hid, Then gently folded hand in hand, And dropped asleep upon the sand. SHE'S ALL MY FANCY PAINTED HIM [This affecting fragment was found in MS. among the papers of the well-known author of “Was it You or I?” a tragedy, and the two popular novels, “Sister and Son,” and “The Niece's Legacy, or the Grateful Grandfather.”] She's all my fancy painted him (I make no idle boast); If he or you had lost a limb, Which would have suffered most? He said that you had been to her, And seen me here before; But, in another character, She was the same of yore. There was not one that spoke to us, Of all that thronged the street: So he sadly got into a 'bus, And pattered with his feet. They sent him word I had not gone (We know it to be true); If she should push the matter on, What would become of you? They gave her one, they gave me two, They gave us three or more; They all returned from him to you, Though they were mine before. If I or she should chance to be Involved in this affair, He trusts to you to set them free, Exactly as we were. It seemed to me that you had been (Before she had this fit) An obstacle, that came between Him, and ourselves, and it. Don't let him know she liked them best, For this must ever be A secret, kept from all the rest, Between yourself and me. PHOTOGRAPHY EXTRAORDINARY The Milk-and-Water School Alas! she would not hear my prayer! Yet it were rash to tear my hair; Disfigured, I should be less fair. She was unwise, I may say blind; Once she was lovingly inclined; Some circumstance has changed her mind. The Strong-Minded or Matter-of-Fact School Well! so my offer was no go! She might do worse, I told her so; She was a fool to answer “No.” However, things are as they stood; Nor would I have her if I could, For there are plenty more as good. The Spasmodic or German School Firebrands and daggers! hope hath fled! To atoms dash the doubly dead! My brain is fire—my heart is lead! Her soul is flint, and what am I? Scorch'd by her fierce, relentless eye, Nothingness is my destiny! LAYS OF MYSTERY, IMAGINATION, AND HUMOUR Number I THE PALACE OF HUMBUG I dreamt I dwelt in marble halls, And each damp thing that creeps and crawls Went wobble-wobble on the walls. Faint odours of departed cheese, Blown on the dank, unwholesome breeze, Awoke the never-ending sneeze. Strange pictures decked the arras drear, Strange characters of woe and fear, The humbugs of the social sphere. One showed a vain and noisy prig, That shouted empty words and big At him that nodded in a wig. And one, a dotard grim and gray, Who wasteth childhood's happy day In work more profitless than play. Whose icy breast no pity warms, Whose little victims sit in swarms, And slowly sob on lower forms. And one, a green thyme-honoured Bank, Where flowers are growing wild and rank, Like weeds that fringe a poisoned tank. All birds of evil omen there Flood with rich Notes the tainted air, The witless wanderer to snare. The fatal Notes neglected fall, No creature heeds the treacherous call, For all those goodly Strawn Baits Pall. The wandering phantom broke and fled, Straightway I saw within my head A vision of a ghostly bed, Where lay two worn decrepit men, The fictions of a lawyer's pen, Who never more might breathe again. The serving-man of Richard Roe Wept, inarticulate with woe: She wept, that waited on John Doe. “Oh rouse,” I urged, “the waning sense With tales of tangled evidence, Of suit, demurrer, and defence.” “Vain,” she replied, “such mockeries: For morbid fancies, such as these, No suits can suit, no plea can please.” And bending o'er that man of straw, She cried in grief and sudden awe, Not inappropriately, “Law!” The well-remembered voice he knew, He smiled, he faintly muttered “Sue!” (Her very name was legal too.) The night was fled, the dawn was nigh: A hurricane went raving by, And swept the Vision from mine eye. Vanished that dim and ghostly bed, (The hangings, tape; the tape was red:) 'Tis o'er, and Doe and Roe are dead! Oh, yet my spirit inly crawls, What time it shudderingly recalls That horrid dream of marble halls! Oxford, 1855. THE MOCK TURTLE'S SONG Beneath the waters of the sea Are lobsters thick as thick can be— They love to dance with you and me, My own, my gentle Salmon! Chorus Salmon, come up! Salmon, go down! Salmon, come twist your tail around! Of all the fishes of the sea There's none so good as Salmon! UPON THE LONELY MOOR (1856) [It is always interesting to ascertain the sources from which our great poets obtained their ideas: this motive has dictated the publication of the following: painful as its appearance must be to the admirers of Wordsworth and his poem of “Resolution and Independence.”] I met an aged, aged man Upon the lonely moor: I knew I was a gentleman, And he was but a boor. So I stopped and roughly questioned him, “Come, tell me how you live!” But his words impressed my ear no more Than if it were a sieve. He said, “I look for soap-bubbles, That lie among the wheat, And bake them into mutton-pies, And sell them in the street. I sell them unto men,” he said, “Who sail on stormy seas; And that's the way I get my bread— A trifle, if you please.” But I was thinking of a way To multiply by ten, And always, in the answer, get The question back again. I did not hear a word he said, But kicked that old man calm, And said, “Come, tell me how you live!” And pinched him in the arm. His accents mild took up the tale: He said, “I go my ways, And when I find a mountain-rill, I set it in a blaze. And thence they make a stuff they call Rowland's Macassar Oil; But fourpence-halfpenny is all They give me for my toil.” But I was thinking of a plan To paint one's gaiters green, So much the colour of the grass That they could ne'er be seen. I gave his ear a sudden box, And questioned him again, And tweaked his grey and reverend locks, And put him into pain. He said, “I hunt for haddocks' eyes Among the heather bright, And work them into waistcoat-buttons In the silent night. And these I do not sell for gold, Or coin of silver-mine, But for a copper-halfpenny, And that will purchase nine. “I sometimes dig for buttered rolls, Or set limed twigs for crabs; I sometimes search the flowery knolls For wheels of hansom cabs. And that's the way” (he gave a wink) “I get my living here, And very gladly will I drink Your Honour's health in beer.” I heard him then, for I had just Completed my design To keep the Menai bridge from rust By boiling it in wine. I duly thanked him, ere I went, For all his stories queer, But chiefly for his kind intent To drink my health in beer. And now if e'er by chance I put My fingers into glue, Or madly squeeze a right-hand foot Into a left-hand shoe; Or if a statement I aver Of which I am not sure, I think of that strange wanderer Upon the lonely moor. MISS JONES (This frolicsome verse was written for a medley of twenty-two tunes that ranged from “The Captain and His Whiskers” to “Rule Britannia.”) 'Tis a melancholy song, and it will not keep you long, Tho I specs it will work upon your feelings very strong, For the agonising moans of Miss Arabella Jones Were warranted to melt the hearts of any paving stones. Simon Smith was tall and slim, and she doted upon him, But he always called her Miss Jones—he never got so far, As to use her Christian name—it was too familiar. When she called him “Simon dear” he pretended not to hear, And she told her sister Susan he behaved extremely queer, Who said, “Very right! very right! Shews his true affection. If you'd prove your Simon's love follow my direction. I'd certainly advise you just to write a simple letter, And to tell him that the cold he kindly asked about is better. And say that by the tanyard you will wait in loving hope, At nine o'clock this evening if he's willing to elope With his faithful Arabella.” So she wrote it, &amp; signed it, &amp; sealed it, &amp; sent it, &amp; dressed herself out in her holiday things. With bracelets &amp; brooches, &amp; earrings, &amp; necklace, a watch, &amp; an eyeglass, &amp; diamond rings, For man is a creature weak and impressible, thinks such a deal of appearance, my dear. So she waited for her Simon beside the tanyard gate, regardless of the pieman, who hinted it was late. Waiting for Simon, she coughed in the chilly night, until the tanner found her, And kindly brought a light old coat to wrap around her. She felt her cold was getting worse, Yet still she fondly whispered, “Oh, take your time, my Simon, although I've waited long. I do not fear my Simon dear will fail to come at last, Although I know that long ago the time I named is past. My Simon! My Simon! Oh, charming man! Oh, charming man! Dear Simon Smith, sweet Simon Smith.” Oh, there goes the church-clock, the town-clock, the station-clock and there go the other clocks, they are all striking twelve! Oh, Simon, it is getting late, it's very dull to sit and wait. And really I'm in such a state, I hope you'll come at any rate, quite early in the morning, quite early in the morning. Then with prancing bays &amp; yellow chaise, we'll away to Gretna Green. For when I am with my Simon Smith—oh, that common name! Oh that vulgar name! I shall never rest happy till he's changed that name, but when he has married me, maybe he'll love me to that degree, that he'll grant me my prayer And will call himself “Clare”— So she talked all alone, as she sat upon a stone, Still hoping he would come and find her, and she started most unkimmon, when instead of darling “Simmon” 'twas a strange man that stood behind her, Who civilly observed “Good evening, M'am, I really am surprised to see that you're out here alone, for you must own from thieves you're not secure. A watch, I see. Pray lend it me (I hope the gold is pure). And all those rings, &amp; other things—Don't scream, you know, for long ago The policeman off from his beat has gone. In the kitchen—” “Oh, you desperate villain! Oh, you treacherous thief!” And these were the words of her anger and grief. “When first to Simon Smith I gave my hand I never could have thought he would have acted half so mean as this, And where's the new police? Oh, Simon, Simon! how could you treat your love so ill?” They sit &amp; chatter, they chatter with the cook, the guardians, so they're called, of public peace. Through the tanyard was heard the dismal sound, “How on earth is it policemen never, never, never, can be found?”</field>

(Everybody says “a quarter of a pound,” which is wrong.) III [John gave his brother James a box] John gave his brother James a box: About it there were many locks. James woke and said it gave him pain; So gave it back to John again. The box was not with lid supplied, Yet caused two lids to open wide: And all these locks had never a key— What kind of a box, then, could it be?

V [Three sisters at breakfast were feeding the cat] Three sisters at breakfast were feeding the cat, The first gave it sole—Puss was grateful for that: The next gave it salmon—which Puss thought a treat: The third gave it herring—which Puss wouldn't eat. (Explain the conduct of the cat.) VI [Said the Moon to the Sun] Said the Moon to the Sun, “Is the daylight begun?” Said the Sun to the Moon, “Not a minute too soon.” “You're a Full Moon,” said he. She replied with a frown, “Well! I never did see So uncivil a clown!” (Query. Why was the moon so angry?) VII [“Seven blind of both eyes] When the King found that his money was nearly all gone, and that he really must live more economically, he decided on sending away most of his Wise Men. There were some hundreds of them—very fine old men, and magnificently dressed in green velvet gowns with gold buttons: if they had a fault, it was that they always contradicted one another when he asked for their advice—and they certainly ate and drank enormously. So, on the whole, he was rather glad to get rid of them. But there was an old law, which he did not dare to disobey, which said that there must always be “Seven blind of both eyes: Two blind of one eye: Four that see with both eyes: Nine that see with one eye.” (Query. How many did he keep?)</field>

III [As curly-headed Jemmy was sleeping in bed] As curly-headed Jemmy was sleeping in bed, His brother John gave him a blow on the head; James opened his eyelids, and spying his brother, Doubled his fist, and gave him another. This kind of box then is not so rare; The lids are the eyelids, the locks are the hair, And so every schoolboy can tell to his cost, The key to the tangles is constantly lost.

For more of these dainties Puss took up her stand; But when the third sister stretched out her fair hand Pray why should Puss swallow her ring? VI [“In these degenerate days,” we oft hear said] “In these degenerate days,” we oft hear said, “Manners are lost and chivalry is dead!” No wonder, since in high exalted spheres The same degeneracy, in fact, appears. The Moon, in social matters interfering, Scolded the Sun, when early in appearing; And the rude Sun, her gentle sex ignoring, Called her a fool, thus her pretensions flooring. VII [Five seeing, and seven blind] Five seeing, and seven blind Give us twelve, in all, we find; But all of these, 'tis very plain, Come into account again. For take notice, it may be true, That those blind of one eye are blind for two; And consider contrariwise, That to see with your eye you may have your eyes; So setting one against the other— For a mathematician no great bother— And working the sum, you will understand That sixteen wise men still trouble the land.</field>

Shall pallid mercers drive a roaring trade, And sell the stuffs their hands have never made? And shall not we, in this our mimic scene, Be all that better actors e'er have been? Awake again a Kemble's tragic tone, And make a Liston's humour all our own? Or vie with Mrs. Siddons in the art To rouse the feelings and to charm the heart? While Shakespeare's self, with all his ancient fires, Lights up the forms that tremble on our wires? Why can't we have, in theatres ideal, The good, without the evil of the real? Why may not Marionettes be just as good As larger actors made of flesh and blood? Presumptuous thought! to you and your applause In humbler confidence we trust our cause. PROLOGUE [“Ladies and Gentlemen” seems stiff and cold.] (Misses Beatrice and Ethel Hatch, daughters of Dr. Edwin Hatch, Vice-principal of St. Mary Hall, were friends of the author. He wrote two plays for performance at their house.) Curtain rises and discovers the Speaker, who comes forward, thinking aloud, [Speaker] “Ladies and Gentlemen” seems stiff and cold. There's something personal in “Young and Old”; I'll try “Dear Friends” (addresses audience) Oh! let me call you so. Dear friends, look kindly on our little show. Contrast us not with giants in the Art, Nor say “You should see Sothern in that part”; Nor yet, unkindest cut of all, in fact, Condemn the actors, while you praise the Act. Having by coming proved you find a charm in it, Don't go away, and hint there may be harm in it. Miss Crabb. My dear Miss Verjuice, can it really be? You're just in time, love, for a cup of tea; And so, you went to see those people play. Miss Verjuice. Well! yes, Miss Crabb, and I may truly say You showed your wisdom when you stayed away. Miss C. Doubtless! Theatricals in our quiet town! I've always said, “The law should put them down,” They mean no harm, tho' I begin to doubt it— But now sit down and tell me all about it. Miss V. Well then, Miss Crabb, I won't deceive you, dear; I heard some things I—didn't like to hear: Miss C. But don't omit them now. Miss V. Well! No! I'll try To tell you all the painful history. (They whisper alternately behind a small fan.) Miss V. And then, my dear, Miss Asterisk and he Pretended they were lovers!! Miss C. Gracious me!! (More whispering behind fan.) Speaker. What! Acting love!! And has that ne'er been seen Save with a row of footlights placed between? My gentle censors, let me roundly ask, Do none but actors ever wear a mask? Or have we reached at last that golden age That finds deception only on the Stage? Come, let's confess all round before we budge, When all are guilty, none should play the Judge. We're actors all, a motley company, Some on the Stage, and others—on the sly— And guiltiest he who paints so well his phiz His brother actors scarce know what he is. A truce to moralizing; we invite The goodly company we see to-night To have the little banquet we have got, Well dressed, we hope, and served up hot &amp; hot. “Loan of a Lover” is the leading dish, Concluding with a dainty course of fish; “Whitebait at Greenwich” in the best condition (By Mr. Gladstone's very kind permission). Before the courses will be handed round An Entrée made of Children, nicely browned. Bell rings. But hark! The bell to summon me away; They're anxious to begin their little Play.

      <field name="fulltext">PHANTASMAGORIA [PHANTASMAGORIA] Canto I The Trystyng One winter night, at half-past nine, Cold, tired, and cross, and muddy, I had come home, too late to dine, And supper, with cigars and wine, Was waiting in the study. There was a strangeness in the room, And Something white and wavy Was standing near me in the gloom— I took it for the carpet-broom Left by that careless slavey. But presently the Thing began To shiver and to sneeze: On which I said “Come, come, my man! That's a most inconsiderate plan. Less noise there, if you please!” “I've caught a cold,” the Thing replies, “Out there upon the landing.” I turned to look in some surprise, And there, before my very eyes, A little Ghost was standing! He trembled when he caught my eye, And got behind a chair. “How came you here,” I said, “and why? I never saw a thing so shy. Come out! Don't shiver there!” He said “I'd gladly tell you how, And also tell you why; But” (here he gave a little bow) “You're in so bad a temper now, You'd think it all a lie. “And as to being in a fright, Allow me to remark That Ghosts have just as good a right, In every way, to fear the light, As Men to fear the dark.” “No plea,” said I, “can well excuse Such cowardice in you: For Ghosts can visit when they choose, Whereas we Humans can't refuse To grant the interview.” He said “A flutter of alarm Is not unnatural, is it? I really feared you meant some harm: But, now I see that you are calm, Let me explain my visit. “Houses are classed, I beg to state, According to the number Of Ghosts that they accommodate: (The Tenant merely counts as weight, With Coals and other lumber). “This is a ‘one-ghost’ house, and you, When you arrived last summer, May have remarked a Spectre who Was doing all that Ghosts can do To welcome the new-comer. “In Villas this is always done— However cheaply rented: For, though of course there's less of fun When there is only room for one, Ghosts have to be contented. “That Spectre left you on the Third— Since then you've not been haunted: For, as he never sent us word, 'Twas quite by accident we heard That any one was wanted. “A Spectre has first choice, by right, In filling up a vacancy; Then Phantom, Goblin, Elf, and Sprite— If all these fail them, they invite The nicest Ghoul that they can see. “The Spectres said the place was low, And that you kept bad wine: So, as a Phantom had to go, And I was first, of course, you know, I couldn't well decline.” “No doubt,” said I, “they settled who Was fittest to be sent: Yet still to choose a brat like you, To haunt a man of forty-two, Was no great compliment!” “I'm not so young, Sir,” he replied, “As you might think. The fact is, In caverns by the water-side, And other places that I've tried, I've had a lot of practice: “But I have never taken yet A strict domestic part, And in my flurry I forget The Five Good Rules of Etiquette We have to know by heart.” My sympathies were warming fast Towards the little fellow: He was so utterly aghast At having found a Man at last, And looked so scared and yellow. “At least,” I said, “I'm glad to find A Ghost is not a dumb thing! But pray sit down: you'll feel inclined (If, like myself, you have not dined) To take a snack of something: “Though, certainly, you don't appear A thing to offer food to! And then I shall be glad to hear— If you will say them loud and clear— The Rules that you allude to.” “Thanks! You shall hear them by and by. This is a piece of luck!” “What may I offer you?” said I. “Well, since you are so kind, I'll try A little bit of duck. “One slice! And may I ask you for Another drop of gravy?” I sat and looked at him in awe, For certainly I never saw A thing so white and wavy. And still he seemed to grow more white, More vapoury, and wavier— Seen in the dim and flickering light, As he proceeded to recite His “Maxims of Behaviour.” Canto II Hys Fyve Rules “My First—but don't suppose,” he said, “I'm setting you a riddle— Is—if your Victim be in bed, Don't touch the curtains at his head, But take them in the middle, “And wave them slowly in and out, While drawing them asunder; And in a minute's time, no doubt, He'll raise his head and look about With eyes of wrath and wonder. “And here you must on no pretence Make the first observation. Wait for the Victim to commence: No Ghost of any common sense Begins a conversation. “If he should say ‘How came you here?’ (The way that you began, Sir), In such a case your course is clear— ‘On the bat's back, my little dear!’ Is the appropriate answer. “If after this he says no more, You'd best perhaps curtail your Exertions—go and shake the door, And then, if he begins to snore, You'll know the thing's a failure. “By day, if he should be alone— At home or on a walk— You merely give a hollow groan, To indicate the kind of tone In which you mean to talk. “But if you find him with his friends, The thing is rather harder. In such a case success depends On picking up some candle-ends, Or butter, in the larder. “With this you make a kind of slide (It answers best with suet), On which you must contrive to glide, And swing yourself from side to side— One soon learns how to do it. “The Second tells us what is right In ceremonious calls:— ‘First burn a blue or crimson light’ (A thing I quite forgot to-night), ‘Then scratch the door or walls.’” I said “You'll visit here no more, If you attempt the Guy. I'll have no bonfires on my floor— And, as for scratching at the door, I'd like to see you try!” “The Third was written to protect The interests of the Victim, And tells us, as I recollect, To treat him with a grave respect, And not to contradict him.” “That's plain,” said I, “as Tare and Tret, To any comprehension: I only wish some Ghosts I've met Would not so constantly forget The maxim that you mention!” “Perhaps,” he said, “you first transgressed The laws of hospitality: All Ghosts instinctively detest The Man that fails to treat his guest With proper cordiality. “If you address a Ghost as ‘Thing!’ Or strike him with a hatchet, He is permitted by the King To drop all formal parleying— And then you're sure to catch it! “The Fourth prohibits trespassing Where other Ghosts are quartered: And those convicted of the thing (Unless when pardoned by the King) Must instantly be slaughtered. “That simply means ‘be cut up small’: Ghosts soon unite anew: The process scarcely hurts at all— Not more than when you're what you call ‘Cut up’ by a Review. “The Fifth is one you may prefer That I should quote entire:— The King must be addressed as ‘Sir.’ This, from a simple courtier, Is all the Laws require: “But, should you wish to do the thing With out-and-out politeness, Accost him as ‘My Goblin King!’ And always use, in answering, The phrase ‘Your Royal Whiteness!’ ...... “I'm getting rather hoarse, I fear, After so much reciting: So, if you don't object, my dear, We'll try a glass of bitter beer— I think it looks inviting.” Canto III Scarmoges “And did you really walk,” said I, “On such a wretched night? I always fancied Ghosts could fly— If not exactly in the sky, Yet at a fairish height.” “It's very well,” said he, “for Kings To soar above the earth: But Phantoms often find that wings— Like many other pleasant things— Cost more than they are worth. “Spectres of course are rich, and so Can buy them from the Elves: But we prefer to keep below— They're stupid company, you know, For any but themselves: “For, though they claim to be exempt From pride, they treat a Phantom As something quite beneath contempt— Just as no Turkey ever dreamt Of noticing a Bantam.” “They seem too proud,” said I, “to go To houses such as mine. Pray, how did they contrive to know So quickly that ‘the place was low,’ And that I ‘kept bad wine’?” “Inspector Kobold came to you—” The little Ghost began. Here I broke in—“Inspector who? Inspecting Ghosts is something new! Explain yourself, my man!” “His name is Kobold,” said my guest: “One of the Spectre order: You'll very often see him dressed In a yellow gown, a crimson vest, And a night-cap with a border. “He tried the Brocken business first, But caught a sort of chill; So came to England to be nursed, And here it took the form of thirst, Which he complains of still. “Port-wine, he says, when rich and sound, Warms his old bones like nectar: And as the inns, where it is found, Are his especial hunting-ground, We call him the Inn-Spectre.” I bore it—bore it like a man— This agonizing witticism! And nothing could be sweeter than My temper, till the Ghost began Some most provoking criticism. “Cooks need not be indulged in waste; Yet still you'd better teach them Dishes should have some sort of taste. Pray, why are all the cruets placed Where nobody can reach them? “That man of yours will never earn His living as a waiter! Is that queer thing supposed to burn? (It's far too dismal a concern To call a Moderator.) “The duck was tender, but the peas Were very much too old: And just remember, if you please, The next time you have toasted cheese, Don't let them send it cold. “You'd find the bread improved, I think, By getting better flour: And have you anything to drink That looks a little less like ink, And isn't quite so sour?” Then, peering round with curious eyes, He muttered “Goodness gracious!” And so went on to criticize— “Your room's an inconvenient size: It's neither snug nor spacious. “That narrow window, I expect, Serves but to let the dusk in—” “But please,” said I, “to recollect 'Twas fashioned by an architect Who pinned his faith on Ruskin!” “I don't care who he was, Sir, or On whom he pinned his faith! Constructed by whatever law, So poor a job I never saw, As I'm a living Wraith! “What a re-markable cigar! How much are they a dozen?” I growled “No matter what they are! You're getting as familiar As if you were my cousin! “Now that's a thing I will not stand, And so I tell you flat.” “Aha,” said he, “we're getting grand!” (Taking a bottle in his hand) “I'll soon arrange for that!” And here he took a careful aim, And gaily cried “Here goes!” I tried to dodge it as it came, But somehow caught it, all the same, Exactly on my nose. And I remember nothing more That I can clearly fix, Till I was sitting on the floor, Repeating “Two and five are four, But five and two are six.” What really passed I never learned, Nor guessed: I only know That, when at last my sense returned, The lamp, neglected, dimly burned— The fire was getting low— Through driving mists I seemed to see A Thing that smirked and smiled: And found that he was giving me A lesson in Biography, As if I were a child. Canto IV Hys Nouryture “Oh, when I was a little Ghost, A merry time had we! Each seated on his favourite post, We chumped and chawed the buttered toast They gave us for our tea.” “That story is in print!” I cried. “Don't say it's not, because It's known as well as Bradshaw's Guide!” (The Ghost uneasily replied He hardly thought it was.) “It's not in Nursery Rhymes? And yet I almost think it is— ‘Three little Ghosteses’ were set ‘On posteses,’ you know, and ate Their ‘buttered toasteses.’ “I have the book; so if you doubt it—” I turned to search the shelf. “Don't stir!” he cried. “We'll do without it: I now remember all about it; I wrote the thing myself. “It came out in a ‘Monthly,’ or At least my agent said it did: Some literary swell, who saw It, thought it seemed adapted for The Magazine he edited. “My father was a Brownie, Sir; My mother was a Fairy. The notion had occurred to her, The children would be happier, If they were taught to vary. “The notion soon became a craze; And, when it once began, she Brought us all out in different ways— One was a Pixy, two were Fays, Another was a Banshee; “The Fetch and Kelpie went to school And gave a lot of trouble; Next came a Poltergeist and Ghoul, And then two Trolls (which broke the rule), A Goblin, and a Double— “(If that's a snuff-box on the shelf,” He added with a yawn, “I'll take a pinch)—next came an Elf, And then a Phantom (that's myself), And last, a Leprechaun. “One day, some Spectres chanced to call, Dressed in the usual white: I stood and watched them in the hall, And couldn't make them out at all, They seemer so strange a sight. “I wondered what on earth they were, That looked all head and sack; But Mother told me not to stare, And then she twitched me by the hair, And punched me in the back. “Since then I've often wished that I Had been a Spectre born. But what's the use?” (He heaved a sigh.) “They are the ghost-nobility, And look on us with scorn. “My phantom-life was soon begun: When I was barely six, I went out with an older one— And just at first I thought it fun, And learned a lot of tricks. “I've haunted dungeons, castles, towers— Wherever I was sent: I've often sat and howled for hours, Drenched to the skin with driving showers, Upon a battlement. “It's quite old-fashioned now to groan When you begin to speak: This is the newest thing in tone—” And here (it chilled me to the bone) He gave an awful squeak. “Perhaps,” he added, “to your ear That sounds an easy thing? Try it yourself, my little dear! It took me something like a year, With constant practising. “And when you've learned to squeak, my man, And caught the double sob, You're pretty much where you began: Just try and gibber if you can! That's something like a job! “I've tried it, and can only say I'm sure you couldn't do it, e- ven if you practised night and day, Unless you have a turn that way, And natural ingenuity. “Shakspeare I think it is who treats Of Ghosts, in days of old, Who ‘gibbered in the Roman streets,’ Dressed, if you recollect, in sheets— They must have found it cold. “I've often spent ten pounds on stuff, In dressing as a Double; But, though it answers as a puff, It never has effect enough To make it worth the trouble. “Long bills soon quenched the little thirst I had for being funny. The setting-up is always worst: Such heaps of things you want at first, One must be made of money! “For instance, take a Haunted Tower, With skull, cross-bones, and sheet; Blue lights to burn (say) two an hour, Condensing lens of extra power, And set of chains complete: “What with the things you have to hire— The fitting on the robe— And testing all the coloured fire— The outfit of itself would tire The patience of a Job! “And then they're so fastidious, The Haunted-House Committee: I've often known them make a fuss Because a Ghost was French, or Russ, Or even from the City! “Some dialects are objected to— For one, the Irish brogue is: And then, for all you have to do, One pound a week they offer you, And find yourself in Bogies!” Canto V Byckerment “Don't they consult the ‘Victims,’ though?” I said. “They should, by rights, Give them a chance—because, you know, The tastes of people differ so, Especially in Sprites.” The Phantom shook his head and smiled. “Consult them? Not a bit! 'Twould be a job to drive one wild, To satisfy one single child— There'd be no end to it!” “Of course you can't leave children free,” Said I, “to pick and choose: But, in the case of men like me, I think ‘Mine Host’ might fairly be Allowed to state his views.” He said “It really wouldn't pay— Folk are so full of fancies. We visit for a single day, And whether then we go, or stay, Depends on circumstances. “And, though we don't consult ‘Mine Host’ Before the thing's arranged, Still, if he often quits his post, Or is not a well-mannered Ghost, Then you can have him changed. “But if the host's a man like you— I mean a man of sense; And if the house is not too new—” “Why, what has that,” said I, “to do With Ghost's convenience?” “A new house does not suit, you know— It's such a job to trim it: But, after twenty years or so, The wainscotings begin to go, So twenty is the limit.” “To trim” was not a phrase I could Remember having heard: “Perhaps,” I said, “you'll be so good As tell me what is understood Exactly by that word?” “It means the loosening all the doors,” The Ghost replied, and laughed: “It means the drilling holes by scores In all the skirting-boards and floors, To make a thorough draught. “You'll sometimes find that one or two Are all you really need To let the wind come whistling through— But here there'll be a lot to do!” I faintly gasped “Indeed! “If I'd been rather later, I'll Be bound,” I added, trying (Most unsuccessfully) to smile, “You'd have been busy all this while, Trimming and beautifying?” “Why, no,” said he; “perhaps I should Have stayed another minute— But still no Ghost, that's any good, Without an introduction would Have ventured to begin it. “The proper thing, as you were late, Was certainly to go: But, with the roads in such a state, I got the Knight-Mayor's leave to wait For half an hour or so.” “Who's the Knight-Mayor?” I cried. Instead Of answering my question, “Well, if you don't know that,” he said, “Either you never go to bed, Or you've a grand digestion! “He goes about and sits on folk That eat too much at night: His duties are to pinch, and poke, And squeeze them till they nearly choke.” (I said “It serves them right!”) “And folk who sup on things like these—” He muttered, “eggs and bacon— Lobster—and duck—and toasted cheese— If they don't get an awful squeeze, I'm very much mistaken! “He is immensely fat, and so Well suits the occupation: In point of fact, if you must know, We used to call him years ago, The Mayor and Corporation! “The day he was elected Mayor I know that every Sprite meant To vote for me, but did not dare— He was so frantic with despair And furious with excitement. “When it was over, for a whim, He ran to tell the King; And being the reverse of slim, A two-mile trot was not for him A very easy thing. “So, to reward him for his run (As it was baking hot, And he was over twenty stone), The King proceeded, half in fun, To knight him on the spot.” “'Twas a great liberty to take!” (I fired up like a rocket.) “He did it just for punning's sake: ‘The man,’ says Johnson, ‘that would make A pun, would pick a pocket!’” “A man,” said he, “is not a King.” I argued for a while, And did my best to prove the thing— The Phantom merely listening With a contemptuous smile. At last, when, breath and patience spent, I had recourse to smoking— “Your aim,” he said, “is excellent: But—when you call it argument— Of course you're only joking?” Stung by his cold and snaky eye, I roused myself at length To say, “At least I do defy The veriest sceptic to deny That union is strength!” “That's true enough,” said he, “yet stay—” I listened in all meekness— “Union is strength, I'm bound to say; In fact, the thing's as clear as day; But onions are a weakness.” Canto VI Discomfyture As one who strives a hill to climb, Who never climbed before: Who finds it, in a little time, Grow every moment less sublime, And votes the thing a bore: Yet, having once begun to try, Dares not desert his quest, But, climbing, ever keeps his eye On one small hut against the sky Wherein he hopes to rest: Who climbs till nerve and force are spent, With many a puff and pant: Who still, as rises the ascent, In language grows more violent, Although in breath more scant: Who, climbing, gains at length the place That crowns the upward track: And, entering with unsteady pace, Receives a buffet in the face That lands him on his back: And feels himself, like one in sleep, Glide swiftly down again, A helpless weight, from steep to steep, Till, with a headlong giddy sweep, He drops upon the plain— So I, that had resolved to bring Conviction to a ghost, And found it quite a different thing From any human arguing, Yet dared not quit my post. But, keeping still the end in view To which I hoped to come, I strove to prove the matter true By putting everything I knew Into an axiom: Commencing every single phrase With “therefore” or “because,” I blindly reeled, a hundred ways, About the syllogistic maze, Unconscious where I was. Quoth he “That's regular clap-trap: Don't bluster any more. Now do be cool and take a nap! Such a ridiculous old chap Was never seen before! “You're like a man I used to meet, Who got one day so furious In arguing, the simple heat Scorched both his slippers off his feet!” I said “That's very curious!” “Well, it is curious, I agree, And sounds perhaps like fibs: But still it's true as true can be— As sure as your name's Tibbs,” said he. I said “My name's not Tibbs.” “Not Tibbs!” he cried—his tone became A shade or two less hearty— “Why, no,” said I. “My proper name Is Tibbets—” “Tibbets?” “Aye, the same.” “Why, then you're not the party!” With that he struck the board a blow That shivered half the glasses. “Why couldn't you have told me so Three quarters of an hour ago, You prince of all the asses? “To walk four miles through mud and rain, To spend the night in smoking, And then to find that it's in vain— And I've to do it all again— It's really too provoking! “Don't talk!” he cried, as I began To mutter some excuse. “Who can have patience with a man That's got no more discretion than An idiotic goose? “To keep me waiting here, instead Of telling me at once That this was not the house!” he said. “There, that'll do—be off to bed! Don't gape like that, you dunce!” “It's very fine to throw the blame On me in such a fashion! Why didn't you enquire my name The very minute that you came?” I answered in a passion. “Of course it worries you a bit To come so far on foot— But how was I to blame for it?” “Well, well!” said he. “I must admit That isn't badly put. “And certainly you've given me The best of wine and victual— Excuse my violence,” said he, “But accidents like this, you see, They put one out a little. “'Twas my fault after all, I find— Shake hands, old Turnip-top!” The name was hardly to my mind, But, as no doubt he meant it kind, I let the matter drop. “Good-night, old Turnip-top, good-night! When I am gone, perhaps They'll send you some inferior Sprite, Who'll keep you in a constant fright And spoil your soundest naps. “Tell him you'll stand no sort of trick; Then, if he leers and chuckles, You just be handy with a stick (Mind that it's pretty hard and thick) And rap him on the knuckles! “Then carelessly remark ‘Old coon! Perhaps you're not aware That, if you don't behave, you'll soon Be chuckling to another tune— And so you'd best take care!’ “That's the right way to cure a Sprite Of such-like goings-on— But gracious me! It's getting light! Good-night, old Turnip-top, good-night!” A nod, and he was gone. Canto VII Sad Souvenaunce “What's this?” I pondered. “Have I slept? Or can I have been drinking?” But soon a gentler feeling crept Upon me, and I sat and wept An hour or so, like winking. “No need for Bones to hurry so!” I sobbed. “In fact, I doubt If it was worth his while to go— And who is Tibbs, I'd like to know, To make such work about? “If Tibbs is anything like me, It's possible,” I said, “He won't be over-pleased to be Dropped in upon at half-past three, After he's snug in bed. “And if Bones plagues him anyhow— Squeaking and all the rest of it, As he was doing here just now— I prophesy there'll be a row, And Tibbs will have the best of it!” Then, as my tears could never bring The friendly Phantom back, It seemed to me the proper thing To mix another glass, and sing The following Coronach. And art thou gone, beloved Ghost? Best of Familiars! Nay then, farewell, my duckling roast, Farewell, farewell, my tea and toast, My meerschaum and cigars! The hues of life are dull and gray, The sweets of life insipid, When thou, my charmer, art away— Old Brick, or rather, let me say, Old Parallelepiped!” Instead of singing Verse the Third, I ceased—abruptly, rather: But, after such a splendid word I felt that it would be absurd To try it any farther. So with a yawn I went my way To seek the welcome downy, And slept, and dreamed till break of day Of Poltergeist and Fetch and Fay And Leprechaun and Brownie! For years I've not been visited By any kind of Sprite; Yet still they echo in my head, Those parting words, so kindly said, “Old Turnip-top, good-night!” ECHOES Lady Clara Vere de Vere Was eight years old, she said: Every ringlet, lightly shaken, ran itself in golden thread. She took her little porringer: Of me she shall not win renown: For the baseness of its nature shall have strength to drag her down. “Sisters and brothers, little Maid? There stands the Inspector at thy door: Like a dog, he hunts for boys who know not two and two are four.” “Kind hearts are more than coronets,” She said, and wondering looked at me: “It is the dead unhappy night, and I must hurry home to tea.” A SEA DIRGE There are certain things—as, a spider, a ghost, The income-tax, gout, an umbrella for three— That I hate, but the thing that I hate the most Is a thing they call the Sea. Pour some salt water over the floor— Ugly I'm sure you'll allow it to be: Suppose it extended a mile or more, That's very like the Sea. Beat a dog till it howls outright— Cruel, but all very well for a spree: Suppose that he did so day and night, That would be like the Sea. I had a vision of nursery-maids; Tens of thousands passed by me— All leading children with wooden spades, And this was by the Sea. Who invented those spades of wood? Who was it cut them out of the tree? None, I think, but an idiot could— Or one that loved the Sea. It is pleasant and dreamy, no doubt, to float With “thoughts as boundless, and souls as free”: But, suppose you are very unwell in the boat, How do you like the Sea? There is an insect that people avoid (Whence is derived the verb “to flee”). Where have you been by it most annoyed? In lodgings by the Sea. If you like your coffee with sand for dregs, A decided hint of salt in your tea, And a fishy taste in the very eggs— By all means choose the Sea. And if, with these dainties to drink and eat, You prefer not a vestige of grass or tree, And a chronic state of wet in your feet, Then—I recommend the Sea. For I have friends who dwell by the coast— Pleasant friends they are to me! It is when I am with them I wonder most That anyone likes the Sea. They take me a walk: though tired and stiff, To climb the heights I madly agree; And, after a tumble or so from the cliff, They kindly suggest the Sea. I try the rocks, and I think it cool That they laugh with such an excess of glee, As I heavily slip into every pool That skirts the cold cold Sea. YE CARPETTE KNYGHTE I have a horse—a ryghte goode horse— Ne doe Y envye those Who scoure ye playne yn headye course Tyll soddayne on theyre nose They lyghte wyth unexpected force Yt ys—a horse of clothes. I have a saddel—“Say'st thou soe? Wyth styrruppes, Knyghte, to boote?” I sayde not that—I answere “Noe”— Yt lacketh such, I woote: Yt ys a mutton-saddel, loe! Parte of ye fleecye brute. I have a bytte—a ryghte good bytte— As shall bee seene yn tyme. Ye jawe of horse yt wyll not fytte; Yts use ys more sublyme. Fayre Syr, how deemest thou of yt? Yt ys—thys bytte of rhyme. HIAWATHA'S PHOTOGRAPHING [In an age of imitation, I can claim no special merit for this slight attempt at doing what is known to be so easy. Any fairly practised writer, with the slightest ear for rhythm, could compose, for hours together, in the easy running metre of “The Song of Hiawatha.” Having, then, distinctly stated that I challenge no attention in the following little poem to its merely verbal jingle, I must beg the candid reader to confine his criticism to its treatment of the subject.] From his shoulder Hiawatha Took the camera of rosewood, Made of sliding, folding rosewood; Neatly put it all together. In its case it lay compactly, Folded into nearly nothing; But he opened out the hinges, Pushed and pulled the joints and hinges, Till it looked all squares and oblongs, Like a complicated figure In the Second Book of Euclid. This he perched upon a tripod— Crouched beneath its dusky cover— Stretched his hand, enforcing silence— Said, “Be motionless, I beg you!” Mystic, awful was the process. All the family in order Sat before him for their pictures: Each in turn, as he was taken, Volunteered his own suggestions, His ingenious suggestions. First the Governor, the Father: He suggested velvet curtains Looped about a massy pillar; And the corner of a table, Of a rosewood dining-table. He would hold a scroll of something, Hold it firmly in his left-hand; He would keep his right-hand buried (Like Napoleon) in his waistcoat; He would contemplate the distance With a look of pensive meaning, As of ducks that die in tempests. Grand, heroic was the notion: Yet the picture failed entirely: Failed, because he moved a little, Moved, because he couldn't help it. Next, his better half took courage; She would have her picture taken. She came dressed beyond description, Dressed in jewels and in satin Far too gorgeous for an empress. Gracefully she sat down sideways, With a simper scarcely human, Holding in her hand a bouquet Rather larger than a cabbage. All the while that she was sitting, Still the lady chattered, chattered, Like a monkey in the forest. “Am I sitting still?” she asked him. “Is my face enough in profile? Shall I hold the bouquet higher? Will it come into the picture?” And the picture failed completely. Next the Son, the Stunning-Cantab: He suggested curves of beauty, Curves pervading all his figure, Which the eye might follow onward, Till they centered in the breast-pin, Centered in the golden breast-pin. He had learnt it all from Ruskin (Author of “The Stones of Venice,” “Seven Lamps of Architecture,” “Modern Painters,” and some others); And perhaps he had not fully Understood his author's meaning; But, whatever was the reason, All was fruitless, as the picture Ended in an utter failure. Next to him the eldest daughter: She suggested very little, Only asked if he would take her With her look of “passive beauty.” Her idea of passive beauty Was a squinting of the left-eye, Was a drooping of the right-eye, Was a smile that went up sideways To the corner of the nostrils. Hiawatha, when she asked him, Took no notice of the question, Looked as if he hadn't heard it; But, when pointedly appealed to, Smiled in his peculiar manner, Coughed and said it “didn't matter,” Bit his lip and changed the subject. Nor in this was he mistaken, As the picture failed completely. So in turn the other sisters. Last, the youngest son was taken: Very rough and thick his hair was, Very round and red his face was, Very dusty was his jacket, Very fidgety his manner. And his overbearing sisters Called him names he disapproved of: Called him Johnny, “Daddy's Darling,” Called him Jacky, “Scrubby School-boy.” And, so awful was the picture, In comparison the others Seemed, to one's bewildered fancy, To have partially succeeded. Finally my Hiawatha Tumbled all the tribe together, (“Grouped” is not the right expression), And, as happy chance would have it Did at last obtain a picture Where the faces all succeeded: Each came out a perfect likeness. Then they joined and all abused it, Unrestrainedly abused it, As the worst and ugliest picture They could possibly have dreamed of. “Giving one such strange expressions— Sullen, stupid, pert expressions. Really anyone would take us (Anyone that did not know us) For the most unpleasant people!” (Hiawatha seemed to think so, Seemed to think it not unlikely). All together rang their voices, Angry, loud, discordant voices, As of dogs that howl in concert, As of cats that wail in chorus. But my Hiawatha's patience, His politeness and his patience, Unaccountably had vanished, And he left that happy party. Neither did he leave them slowly, With the calm deliberation, The intense deliberation Of a photographic artist: But he left them in a hurry, Left them in a mighty hurry, Stating that he would not stand it, Stating in emphatic language What he'd be before he'd stand it. Hurriedly he packed his boxes: Hurriedly the porter trundled On a barrow all his boxes: Hurriedly he took his ticket: Hurriedly the train received him: Thus departed Hiawatha. MELANCHOLETTA With saddest music all day long She soothed her secret sorrow: At night she sighed “I fear 'twas wrong Such cheerful words to borrow. Dearest, a sweeter, sadder song I'll sing to thee to-morrow.” I thanked her, but I could not say That I was glad to hear it: I left the house at break of day, And did not venture near it Till time, I hoped, had worn away Her grief, for nought could cheer it! My dismal sister! Couldst thou know The wretched home thou keepest! Thy brother, drowned in daily woe, Is thankful when thou sleepest; For if I laugh, however low, When thou'rt awake, thou weepest! I took my sister t'other day (Excuse the slang expression) To Sadler's Wells to see the play In hopes the new impression Might in her thoughts, from grave to gay Effect some slight digression. I asked three gay young dogs from town To join us in our folly, Whose mirth, I thought, might serve to drown My sister's melancholy: The lively Jones, the sportive Brown, And Robinson the jolly. The maid announced the meal in tones That I myself had taught her, Meant to allay my sister's moans Like oil on troubled water: I rushed to Jones, the lively Jones, And begged him to escort her. Vainly he strove, with ready wit, To joke about the weather— To ventilate the last “on dit”— To quote the price of leather— She groaned “Here I and Sorrow sit: Let us lament together!” I urged “You're wasting time, you know: Delay will spoil the venison.” “My heart is wasted with my woe! There is no rest—in Venice, on The Bridge of Sighs!” she quoted low From Byron and from Tennyson. I need not tell of soup and fish In solemn silence swallowed, The sobs that ushered in each dish, And its departure followed, Nor yet my suicidal wish To be the cheese I hollowed. Some desperate attempts were made To start a conversation; “Madam,” the sportive Brown essayed, “Which kind of recreation, Hunting or fishing, have you made Your special occupation?” Her lips curved downwards instantly, As if of india-rubber. “Hounds in full cry I like,” said she: (Oh, how I longed to snub her!) “Of fish, a whale's the one for me, It is so full of blubber!” The night's performance was “King John.” “It's dull,” she wept, “and so-so!” Awhile I let her tears flow on, She said they soothed her woe so! At length the curtain rose upon “Bombastes Furioso.” In vain we roared; in vain we tried To rouse her into laughter: Her pensive glances wandered wide From orchestra to rafter— “Tier upon tier!” she said, and sighed; And silence followed after. A VALENTINE [Sent to a friend who had complained that I was glad enough to see him when he came, but didn't seem to miss him if he stayed away.] And cannot pleasures, while they last, Be actual unless, when past, They leave us shuddering and aghast, With anguish smarting? And cannot friends be firm and fast, And yet bear parting? And must I then, at Friendship's call, Calmly resign the little all (Trifling, I grant, it is and small) I have of gladness, And lend my being to the thrall Of gloom and sadness? And think you that I should be dumb, And full dolorum omnium, Excepting when you choose to come And share my dinner? At other times be sour and glum And daily thinner? Must he then only live to weep, Who'd prove his friendship true and deep, By day a lonely shadow creep, At night-time languish, Oft raising in his broken sleep The moan of anguish? The lover, if for certain days His fair one be denied his gaze, Sinks not in grief and wild amaze, But, wiser wooer, He spends the time in writing lays, And posts them to her. And if the verse flow free and fast, Till even the poet is aghast, A touching Valentine at last The post shall carry, When thirteen days are gone and past Of February. Farewell, dear friend, and when we meet, In desert waste or crowded street, Perhaps before this week shall fleet, Perhaps to-morrow, I trust to find your heart the seat Of wasting sorrow. THE THREE VOICES The First Voice He trilled a carol fresh and free, He laughed aloud for very glee: There came a breeze from off the sea: It passed athwart the glooming flat— It fanned his forehead as he sat— It lightly bore away his hat, All to the feet of one who stood Like maid enchanted in a wood, Frowning as darkly as she could. With huge umbrella, lank and brown, Unerringly she pinned it down, Right through the centre of the crown. Then, with an aspect cold and grim, Regardless of its battered rim, She took it up and gave it him. A while like one in dreams he stood, Then faltered forth his gratitude In words just short of being rude: For it had lost its shape and shine, And it had cost him four-and-nine, And he was going out to dine. “To dine!” she sneered in acid tone, “To bend thy being to a bone Clothed in a radiance not its own!” The tear-drop trickled to his chin: There was a meaning in her grin That made him feel on fire within. “Term it not ‘radiance,’” said he: “'Tis solid nutriment to me. Dinner is Dinner: Tea is Tea.” And she, “Yea so? Yet wherefore cease? Let thy scant knowledge find increase. Say ‘Men are Men, and Geese are Geese.’” He moaned: he knew not what to say. The thought “That I could get away!” Strove with the thought “But I must stay.” “To dine!” she shrieked in dragon-wrath. “To swallow wines all foam and froth! To simper at a table-cloth! “Say, can thy noble spirit stoop To join the gormandising troop Who find a solace in the soup? “Canst thou desire or pie or puff? Thy well-bred manners were enough, Without such gross material stuff.” “Yet well-bred men,” he faintly said, “Are not unwilling to be fed: Nor are they well without the bread.” Her visage scorched him ere she spoke: “There are,” she said, “a kind of folk Who have no horror of a joke. “Such wretches live: they take their share Of common earth and common air: We come across them here and there: “We grant them—there is no escape— A sort of semi-human shape Suggestive of the man-like Ape.” “In all such theories,” said he, “One fixed exception there must be. That is, the Present Company.” Baffled, she gave a wolfish bark: He, aiming blindly in the dark, With random shaft had pierced the mark. She felt that her defeat was plain, Yet madly strove with might and main To get the upper hand again. Fixing her eyes upon the beach, As though unconscious of his speech, She said “Each gives to more than each.” He could not answer yea or nay: He faltered “Gifts may pass away.” Yet knew not what he meant to say. “If that be so,” she straight replied, “Each heart with each doth coincide. What boots it? For the world is wide.” “The world is but a Thought,” said he: “The vast unfathomable sea Is but a Notion—unto me.” And darkly fell her answer dread Upon his unresisting head, Like half a hundredweight of lead. “The Good and Great must ever shun That reckless and abandoned one Who stoops to perpetrate a pun. “The man that smokes—that reads The Times— That goes to Christmas Pantomimes— Is capable of any crimes!” He felt it was his turn to speak, And, with a shamed and crimson cheek, Moaned “This is harder than Bezique!” But when she asked him “Wherefore so?” He felt his very whiskers glow, And frankly owned “I do not know.” While, like broad waves of golden grain, Or sunlit hues on cloistered pane, His colour came and went again. Pitying his obvious distress, Yet with a tinge of bitterness, She said “The More exceeds the Less.” “A truth of such undoubted weight,” He urged, “and so extreme in date, It were superfluous to state.” Roused into sudden passion, she In tone of cold malignity: “To others, yea: but not to thee.” But when she saw him quail and quake, And when he urged “For pity's sake!” Once more in gentle tones she spake. “Thought in the mind doth still abide That is by Intellect supplied, And within that Idea doth hide: “And he, that yearns the truth to know Still further inwardly may go, And find Idea from Notion flow: “And thus the chain, that sages sought, Is to a glorious circle wrought, For Notion hath its source in Thought.” So passed they on with even pace: Yet gradually one might trace A shadow growing on his face. The Second Voice They walked beside the wave-worn beach; Her tongue was very apt to teach, And now and then he did beseech She would abate her dulcet tone, Because the talk was all her own, And he was dull as any drone. She urged “No cheese is made of chalk”: And ceaseless flowed her dreary talk, Tuned to the footfall of a walk. Her voice was very full and rich, And, when at length she asked him “Which?” It mounted to its highest pitch. He a bewildered answer gave, Drowned in the sullen moaning wave, Lost in the echoes of the cave. He answered her he knew not what: Like shaft from bow at random shot, He spoke, but she regarded not. She waited not for his reply, But with a downward leaden eye Went on as if he were not by— Sound argument and grave defence, Strange questions raised on “Why?” and “Whence?” And wildly tangled evidence. When he, with racked and whirling brain, Feebly implored her to explain, She simply said it all again. Wrenched with an agony intense, He spake, neglecting Sound and Sense, And careless of all consequence: “Mind—I believe—is Essence—Ent— Abstract—that is—an Accident— Which we—that is to say—I meant—” When, with quick breath and cheeks all flushed, At length his speech was somewhat hushed, She looked at him, and he was crushed. It needed not her calm reply: She fixed him with a stony eye, And he could neither fight nor fly. While she dissected, word by word, His speech, half-guessed at and half heard, As might a cat a little bird. Then, having wholly overthrown His views, and stripped them to the bone, Proceeded to unfold her own. “Shall Man be Man? And shall he miss Of other thoughts no thought but this, Harmonious dews of sober bliss? “What boots it? Shall his fevered eye Through towering nothingness descry The grisly phantom hurry by? “And hear dumb shrieks that fill the air; See mouths that gape, and eyes that stare And redden in the dusky glare? “The meadows breathing amber light, The darkness toppling from the height, The feathery train of granite Night? “Shall he, grown gray among his peers, Through the thick curtain of his tears Catch glimpses of his earlier years, “And hear the sounds he knew of yore, Old shufflings on the sanded floor, Old knuckles tapping at the door? “Yet still before him as he flies One pallid form shall ever rise, And, bodying forth in glassy eyes “The vision of a vanished good, Low peering through the tangled wood, Shall freeze the current of his blood.” Still from each fact, with skill uncouth And savage rapture, like a tooth She wrenched some slow reluctant truth. Till, like a silent water-mill, When summer suns have dried the rill, She reached a full stop, and was still. Dead calm succeeded to the fuss, As when the loaded omnibus Has reached the railway terminus: When, for the tumult of the street, Is heard the engine's stifled beat, The velvet tread of porters' feet. With glance that ever sought the ground, She moved her lips without a sound, And every now and then she frowned. He gazed upon the sleeping sea, And joyed in its tranquillity, And in that silence dead, but she To muse a little space did seem, Then, like the echo of a dream, Harked back upon her threadbare theme. Still an attentive ear he lent But could not fathom what she meant: She was not deep, nor eloquent. He marked the ripple on the sand: The even swaying of her hand Was all that he could understand. He saw in dreams a drawing-room, Where thirteen wretches sat in gloom, Waiting—he thought he knew for whom: He saw them drooping here and there, Each feebly huddled on a chair, In attitudes of blank despair: Oysters were not more mute than they, For all their brains were pumped away, And they had nothing more to say— Save one, who groaned “Three hours are gone!” Who shrieked “We'll wait no longer, John! Tell them to set the dinner on!” The vision passed: the ghosts were fled: He saw once more that woman dread: He heard once more the words she said. He left her, and he turned aside: He sat and watched the coming tide Across the shores so newly dried. He wondered at the waters clear, The breeze that whispered in his ear, The billows heaving far and near, And why he had so long preferred To hang upon her every word: “In truth,” he said, “it was absurd.” The Third Voice Not long this transport held its place: Within a little moment's space Quick tears were raining down his face. His heart stood still, aghast with fear; A wordless voice, nor far nor near, He seemed to hear and not to hear. “Tears kindle not the doubtful spark. If so, why not? Of this remark The bearings are profoundly dark.” “Her speech,” he said, “hath caused this pain. Easier I count it to explain The jargon of the howling main, “Or, stretched beside some babbling brook, To con, with inexpressive look, An unintelligible book.” Low spake the voice within his head, In words imagined more than said, Soundless as ghost's intended tread: “If thou art duller than before, Why quittedst thou the voice of lore? Why not endure, expecting more?” “Rather than that,” he groaned aghast, “I'd writhe in depths of cavern vast, Some loathly vampire's rich repast.” “'Twere hard,” it answered, “themes immense To coop within the narrow fence That rings thy scant intelligence.” “Not so,” he urged, “nor once alone: But there was something in her tone That chilled me to the very bone. “Her style was anything but clear, And most unpleasantly severe; Her epithets were very queer. “And yet, so grand were her replies, I could not choose but deem her wise; I did not dare to criticise; “Nor did I leave her, till she went So deep in tangled argument That all my powers of thought were spent.” A little whisper inly slid, “Yet truth is truth: you know you did.” A little wink beneath the lid. And, sickened with excess of dread, Prone to the dust he bent his head, And lay like one three-quarters dead. The whisper left him—like a breeze Lost in the depths of leafy trees— Left him by no means at his ease. Once more he weltered in despair, With hands, through denser-matted hair, More tightly clenched than then they were. When, bathed in Dawn of living red, Majestic frowned the mountain head, “Tell me my fault,” was all he said. When, at high Noon, the blazing sky Scorched in his head each haggard eye, Then keenest rose his weary cry. And when at Eve the unpitying sun Smiled grimly on the solemn fun, “Alack,” he sighed, “what have I done?” But saddest, darkest was the sight, When the cold grasp of leaden Night Dashed him to earth, and held him tight. Tortured, unaided, and alone, Thunders were silence to his groan, Bagpipes sweet music to its tone: “What? Ever thus, in dismal round, Shall Pain and Mystery profound Pursue me like a sleepless hound, “With crimson-dashed and eager jaws, Me, still in ignorance of the cause, Unknowing what I broke of laws?” The whisper to his ear did seem Like echoed flow of silent stream, Or shadow of forgotten dream, The whisper trembling in the wind: “Her fate with thine was intertwined,” So spake it in his inner mind: “Each orbed on each a baleful star: Each proved the other's blight and bar: Each unto each were best, most far: “Yea, each to each was worse than foe: Thou, a scared dullard, gibbering low, And she, an avalanche of woe!” THEME WITH VARIATIONS [Why is it that Poetry has never yet been subjected to that process of Dilution which has proved so advantageous to her sister-art Music? The Diluter gives us first a few notes of some well-known Air, then a dozen bars of his own, then a few more notes of the Air, and so on alternately: thus saving the listener, if not from all risk of recognising the melody at all, at least from the too-exciting transports which it might produce in a more concentrated form. The process is termed “setting” by Composers, and any one, that has ever experienced the emotion of being unexpectedly set down in a heap of mortar, will recognise the truthfulness of this happy phrase. For truly, just as the genuine Epicure lingers lovingly over a morsel of supreme Venison—whose every fibre seems to murmur “Excelsior!”—yet swallows, ere returning to the toothsome dainty, great mouthfuls of oatmeal-porridge and winkles: and just as the perfect Connoisseur in Claret permits himself but one delicate sip, and then tosses off a pint or more of boarding-school beer: so also—] I never loved a dear Gazelle— Nor anything that cost me much: High prices profit those who sell, But why should I be fond of such? To glad me with his soft black eye My son comes trotting home from school; He's had a fight but can't tell why— He always was a little fool! But, when he came to know me well, He kicked me out, her testy Sire: And when I stained my hair, that Belle Might note the change, and thus admire And love me, it was sure to dye A muddy green, or staring blue: Whilst one might trace, with half an eye, The still triumphant carrot through. A GAME OF FIVES Five little girls, of Five, Four, Three, Two, One: Rolling on the hearthrug, full of tricks and fun. Five rosy girls, in years from Ten to Six: Sitting down to lessons—no more time for tricks. Five growing girls, from Fifteen to Eleven: Music, Drawing, Languages, and food enough for seven! Five winsome girls, from Twenty to Sixteen: Each young man that calls, I say “Now tell me which you mean!” Five dashing girls, the youngest Twenty-one: But, if nobody proposes, what is there to be done? Five showy girls—but Thirty is an age When girls may be engaging, but they somehow don't engage. Five dressy girls, of Thirty-one or more: So gracious to the shy young men they snubbed so much before! Five passé girls—Their age? Well, never mind! We jog along together, like the rest of human kind: But the quondam “careless bachelor” begins to think he knows The answer to that ancient problem “how the money goes”! POETA FIT, NON NASCITUR “How shall I be a poet? How shall I write in rhyme: You told me once ‘the very wish Partook of the sublime.’ Then tell me how! Don't put me off With your ‘another time’!” The old man smiled to see him, To hear his sudden sally; He liked the lad to speak his mind Enthusiastically; And thought “There's no hum-drum in him, Nor any shilly-shally.” “And would you be a poet Before you've been to school? Ah, well! I hardly thought you So absolute a fool. First learn to be spasmodic— A very simple rule. “For first you write a sentence, And then you chop it small; Then mix the bits, and sort them out Just as they chance to fall: The order of the phrases makes No difference at all. “Then, if you'd be impressive, Remember what I say, That abstract qualities begin With capitals alway: The True, the Good, the Beautiful— Those are the things that pay! “Next, when you are describing A shape, or sound, or tint; Don't state the matter plainly, But put it in a hint; And learn to look at all things With a sort of mental squint.” “For instance, if I wished, Sir, Of mutton-pies to tell, Should I say ‘dreams of fleecy flocks Pent in a wheaten cell’?” “Why, yes,” the old man said: “that phrase Would answer very well. “Then fourthly, there are epithets That suit with any word— As well as Harvey's Reading Sauce With fish, or flesh, or bird— Of these, ‘wild,’ ‘lonely,’ ‘weary,’ ‘strange,’ Are much to be preferred.” “And will it do, O will it do To take them in a lump— As ‘the wild man went his weary way To a strange and lonely pump’?” “Nay, nay! You must not hastily To such conclusions jump. “Such epithets, like pepper, Give zest to what you write; And, if you strew them sparely, They whet the appetite: But if you lay them on too thick, You spoil the matter quite! “Last, as to the arrangement: Your reader, you should show him, Must take what information he Can get, and look for no im- mature disclosure of the drift And purpose of your poem. “Therefore, to test his patience— How much he can endure— Mention no places, names, or dates, And evermore be sure Throughout the poem to be found Consistently obscure. “First fix upon the limit To which it shall extend: Then fill it up with ‘Padding’ (Beg some of any friend): Your great Sensation-stanza You place towards the end.” “And what is a Sensation, Grandfather, tell me, pray? I think I never heard the word So used before to-day: Be kind enough to mention one ‘Exempli gratiâ.’” And the old man, looking sadly Across the garden-lawn, Where here and there a dew-drop Yet glittered in the dawn, Said “Go to the Adelphi, And see the ‘Colleen Bawn.’ “The word is due to Boucicault— The theory is his, Where life becomes a Spasm, And History a Whiz: If that is not Sensation, I don't know what it is. “Now try your hand, ere Fancy Have lost its present glow—” “And then,” his grandson added, “We'll publish it, you know: Green cloth—gold-lettered at the back— In duodecimo!” Then proudly smiled that old man To see the eager lad Rush madly for his pen and ink And for his blotting-pad— But, when he thought of publishing, His face grew stern and sad. SIZE AND TEARS When on the sandy shore I sit, Beside the salt sea-wave, And falling into a weeping fit Because I dare not shave— A little whisper at my ear Enquires the reason of my fear. I answer “If that ruffian Jones Should recognise me here, He'd bellow out my name in tones Offensive to the ear: He chaffs me so on being stout (A thing that always puts me out).” Ah me! I see him on the cliff! Farewell, farewell to hope, If he should look this way, and if He's got his telescope! To whatsoever place I flee, My odious rival follows me! For every night, and everywhere, I meet him out at dinner; And when I've found some charming fair, And vowed to die or win her, The wretch (he's thin and I am stout) Is sure to come and cut me out! The girls (just like them!) all agree To praise J. Jones, Esquire: I ask them what on earth they see About him to admire? They cry “He is so sleek and slim, It's quite a treat to look at him!” They vanish in tobacco smoke, Those visionary maids— I feel a sharp and sudden poke Between the shoulder-blades— “Why, Brown, my boy! You're growing stout!” (I told you he would find me out!) “My growth is not your business, Sir!” “No more it is, my boy! But if it's yours, as I infer, Why, Brown, I give you joy! A man, whose business prospers so, Is just the sort of man to know! “It's hardly safe, though, talking here— I'd best get out of reach: For such a weight as yours, I fear, Must shortly sink the beach!”— Insult me thus because I'm stout! I vow I'll go and call him out! ATALANTA IN CAMDEN-TOWN Ay, 'twas here, on this spot, In that summer of yore, Atalanta did not Vote my presence a bore, Nor reply to my tenderest talk “She had heard all that nonsense before.” She'd the brooch I had bought And the necklace and sash on, And her heart, as I thought, Was alive to my passion; And she'd done up her hair in the style that the Empress had brought into fashion. I had been to the play With my pearl of a Peri— But, for all I could say, She declared she was weary, That “the place was so crowded and hot, and she couldn't abide that Dundreary.” Then I thought “Lucky boy! 'Tis for you that she whimpers!” And I noted with joy Those sensational simpers: And I said “This is scrumptious!”—a phrase I had learned from the Devonshire shrimpers. And I vowed “'Twill be said I'm a fortunate fellow, When the breakfast is spread, When the topers are mellow, When the foam of the bride-cake is white, and the fierce orange blossoms are yellow!” O that languishing yawn! O those eloquent eyes! I was drunk with the dawn Of a splendid surmise— I was stung by a look, I was slain by a tear, by a tempest of sighs. Then I whispered “I see The sweet secret thou keepest. And the yearning for ME That thou wistfully weepest! And the question is ‘License or Banns?’ though undoubtedly Banns are the cheapest.” “Be my Hero,” said I, “And let me be Leander!” But I lost her reply— Something ending with “gander”— For the omnibus rattled so loud that no mortal could quite understand her. THE LANG COORTIN' The ladye she stood at her lattice high, Wi' her doggie at her feet; Thorough the lattice she can spy The passers in the street, “There's one that standeth at the door, And tirleth at the pin: Now speak and say, my popinjay, If I sall let him in.” Then up and spake the popinjay That flew abune her head: “Gae let him in that tirls the pin: He cometh thee to wed.” O when he cam' the parlour in, A woeful man was he! “And dinna ye ken your lover agen, Sae well that loveth thee?” “And how wad I ken ye loved me, Sir, That have been sae lang away? And how wad I ken ye loved me, Sir? Ye never telled me sae.” Said—“Ladye dear,” and the salt, salt tear Cam' rinnin' doon his cheek, “I have sent the tokens of my love This many and many a week. “O didna ye get the rings, Ladye, The rings o' the gowd sae fine? I wot that I have sent to thee Four score, four score and nine.” “They cam' to me,” said that fair ladye. “Wow, they were flimsie things!” Said—“that chain o' gowd, my doggie to howd, It is made o' thae self-same rings.” “And didna ye get the locks, the locks, The locks o' my ain black hair, Whilk I sent by post, whilk I sent by box, Whilk I sent by the carrier?” “They cam' to me,” said that fair ladye; “And I prithee send nae mair!” Said—“that cushion sae red, for my doggie's head, It is stuffed wi' thae locks o' hair.” “And didna ye get the letter, Ladye, Tied wi' a silken string, Whilk I sent to thee frae the far countrie, A message of love to bring?” “It cam' to me frae the far countrie Wi' its silken string and a'; But it wasna prepaid,” said that high-born maid, “Sae I gar'd them tak' it awa'.” “O ever alack that ye sent it back, It was written sae clerkly and well! Now the message it brought, and the boon that it sought, I must even say it mysel'.” Then up and spake the popinjay, Sae wisely counselled he. “Now say it in the proper way: Gae doon upon thy knee!” The lover he turned baith red and pale, Went doon upon his knee: “O Ladye, hear the waesome tale That must be told to thee! “For five lang years, and five lang years, I coorted thee by looks; By nods and winks, by smiles and tears, As I had read in books. “For ten lang years, O weary hours! I coorted thee by signs; By sending game, by sending flowers, By sending Valentines. “For five lang years, and five lang years, I have dwelt in the far countrie, Till that thy mind should be inclined Mair tenderly to me. “Now thirty years are gane and past, I am come frae a foreign land: I am come to tell thee my love at last— O Ladye, gie me thy hand!” The ladye she turned not pale nor red, But she smiled a pitiful smile: “Sic' a coortin' as yours, my man,” she said, “Takes a lang and a weary while!” And out and laughed the popinjay, A laugh of bitter scorn: “A coortin' done in sic' a way, It ought not to be borne!” Wi' that the doggie barked aloud, And up and doon he ran, And tugged and strained his chain o' gowd, All for to bite the man. “O hush thee, gentle popinjay! O hush thee, doggie dear! There is a word I fain wad say, It needeth he should hear!” Aye louder screamed that ladye fair To drown her doggie's bark: Ever the lover shouted mair To make that ladye hark: Shrill and more shrill the popinjay Upraised his angry squall: I trow the doggie's voice that day Was louder than them all! The serving-men and serving-maids Sat by the kitchen fire: They heard sic' a din the parlour within As made them much admire. Out spake the boy in buttons (I ween he wasna thin), “Now wha will tae the parlour gae, And stay this deadlie din?” And they have taen a kerchief, Casted their kevils in, For wha will tae the parlour gae, And stay that deadlie din. When on that boy the kevil fell To stay the fearsome noise, “Gae in,” they cried, “whate'er betide, Thou prince of button-boys!” Syne, he has taen a supple cane To swinge that dog sae fat: The doggie yowled, the doggie howled The louder aye for that. Syne, he has taen a mutton-bane— The doggie ceased his noise, And followed doon the kitchen stair That prince of button-boys! Then sadly spake that ladye fair, Wi' a frown upon her brow: “O dearer to me is my sma' doggie Than a dozen sic' as thou! “Nae use, nae use for sighs and tears: Nae use at all to fret: Sin' ye've bided sae well for thirty years, Ye may bide a wee langer yet!” Sadly, sadly he crossed the floor And tirlëd at the pin: Sadly went he through the door Where sadly he cam' in. “O gin I had a popinjay To fly abune my head, To tell me what I ought to say, I had by this been wed. “O gin I find anither ladye,” He said wi' sighs and tears, “I wot my coortin' sall not be Anither thirty years “For gin I find a ladye gay, Exactly to my taste, I'll pop the question, aye or nay, In twenty years at maist.” FOUR RIDDLES [These consist of two Double Acrostics and two Charades. No. I. was written at the request of some young friends, who had gone to a ball at an Oxford Commemoration—and also as a specimen of what might be done by making the Double Acrostic a connected poem instead of what it has hitherto been, a string of disjointed stanzas, on every conceivable subject, and about as interesting to read straight through as a page of a Cyclopedia. The first two stanzas describe the two main words, and each subsequent stanza one of the cross “lights.” No. II. was written after seeing Miss Ellen Terry perform in the play of “Hamlet.” In this case the first stanza describes the two main words. No. III. was written after seeing Miss Marion Terry perform in Mr. Gilbert's play of “Pygmalion and Galatea.” The three stanzas respectively describe “My First,” “My Second,” and “My Whole.”] I There was an ancient City, stricken down With a strange frenzy, and for many a day They paced from morn to eve the crowded town, And danced the night away. I asked the cause: the aged man grew sad: They pointed to a building gray and tall, And hoarsely answered “Step inside, my lad, And then you'll see it all.” Yet what are all such gaieties to me Whose thoughts are full of indices and surds? x??7x?53 ?11/3. But something whispered “It will soon be done: Bands cannot always play, nor ladies smile: Endure with patience the distasteful fun For just a little while!” A change came o'er my Vision—it was night: We clove a pathway through a frantic throng: The steeds, wild-plunging, filled us with affright: The chariots whirled along. Within a marble hall a river ran— A living tide, half muslin and half cloth: And here one mourned a broken wreath or fan, Yet swallowed down her wrath; And here one offered to a thirsty fair (His words half-drowned amid those thunders tuneful) Some frozen viand (there were many there), A tooth-ache in each spoonful. There comes a happy pause, for human strength Will not endure to dance without cessation; And every one must reach the point at length Of absolute prostration. At such a moment ladies learn to give, To partners who would urge them overmuch, A flat and yet decided negative— Photographers love such. There comes a welcome summons—hope revives, And fading eyes grow bright, and pulses quicken: Incessant pop the corks, and busy knives Dispense the tongue and chicken. Flushed with new life, the crowd flows back again: And all is tangled talk and mazy motion— Much like a waving field of golden grain, Or a tempestuous ocean. And thus they give the time, that Nature meant For peaceful sleep and meditative snores, To ceaseless din and mindless merriment And waste of shoes and floors. And One (we name him not) that flies the flowers, That dreads the dances, and that shuns the salads, They doom to pass in solitude the hours, Writing acrostic-ballads. How late it grows! The hour is surely past That should have warned us with its double knock? The twilight wanes, and morning comes at last— “Oh, Uncle, what's o'clock?” The Uncle gravely nods, and wisely winks. It may mean much, but how is one to know? He opes his mouth—yet out of it, methinks, No words of wisdom flow. Answer: Commemoration, Monstrosities. II Empress of Art, for thee I twine This wreath with all too slender skill. Forgive my Muse each halting line, And for the deed accept the will! O day of tears! Whence comes this spectre grim, Parting, like Death's cold river, souls that love? Is not he bound to thee, as thou to him, By vows, unwhispered here, yet heard above? And still it lives, that keen and heavenward flame, Lives in his eye, and trembles in his tone: And these wild words of fury but proclaim A heart that beats for thee, for thee alone! But all is lost: that mighty mind o'erthrown, Like sweet bells jangled, piteous sight to see! “Doubt that the stars are fire,” so runs his moan, “Doubt Truth herself, but not my love for thee!” A sadder vision yet: thine aged sire Shaming his hoary locks with treacherous wile! And dost thou now doubt Truth to be a liar? And wilt thou die, that hast forgot to smile? Nay, get thee hence! Leave all thy winsome ways And the faint fragrance of thy scattered flowers: In holy silence wait the appointed days, And weep away the leaden-footed hours. Answer: Ellen Terry. III The air is bright with hues of light And rich with laughter and with singing: Young hearts beat high in ecstasy, And banners wave, and bells are ringing: But silence falls with fading day, And there's an end to mirth and play. Ah, well-a-day! Rest your old bones, ye wrinkled crones! The kettle sings, the firelight dances. Deep be it quaffed, the magic draught That fills the soul with golden fancies! For Youth and Pleasance will not stay, And ye are withered, worn, and gray. Ah, well-a-day! O fair cold face! O form of grace, For human passion madly yearning! O weary air of dumb despair, From marble won, to marble turning! “Leave us not thus!” we fondly pray. “We cannot let thee pass away!” Ah, well-a-day! Answer: Galatea (Gala-tea). IV My First is singular at best: More plural is my Second: My Third is far the pluralest— So plural-plural, I protest It scarcely can be reckoned! My First is followed by a bird: My Second by believers In magic art: my simple Third Follows, not often, hopes absurd And plausible deceivers. My First to get at wisdom tries— A failure melancholy! My Second men revered as wise: My Third from heights of wisdom flies To depths of frantic folly. My First is ageing day by day: My Second's age is ended: My Third enjoys an age, they say, That never seems to fade away, Through centuries extended. My Whole? I need a poet's pen To paint her myriad phases: The monarch, and the slave, of men— A mountain-summit, and a den Of dark and deadly mazes— A flashing light—a fleeting shade— Beginning, end, and middle Of all that human art hath made Or wit devised! Go, seek her aid, If you would read my riddle! Answer: Imagination (I-Magi-nation). FAME'S PENNY-TRUMPET [Affectionately dedicated to all “original researchers” who pant for “endowment.”] Blow, blow your trumpets till they crack, Ye little men of little souls! And bid them huddle at your back— Gold-sucking leeches, shoals on shoals! Fill all the air with hungry wails— “Reward us, ere we think or write! Without your Gold mere Knowledge fails To sate the swinish appetite!” And, where great Plato paced serene, Or Newton paused with wistful eye, Rush to the chace with hoofs unclean And Babel-clamour of the sty. Be yours the pay: be theirs the praise: We will not rob them of their due, Nor vex the ghosts of other days By naming them along with you. They sought and found undying fame: They toiled not for reward nor thanks: Their cheeks are hot with honest shame For you, the modern mountebanks! Who preach of Justice—plead with tears That Love and Mercy should abound— While marking with complacent ears The moaning of some tortured hound: Who prate of Wisdom—nay, forbear, Lest Wisdom turn on you in wrath, Trampling, with heel that will not spare, The vermin that beset her path! Go, throng each other's drawing-rooms, Ye idols of a petty clique: Strut your brief hour in borrowed plumes And make your penny-trumpets squeak: Deck your dull talk with pilfered shreds Of learning from a nobler time, And oil each other's little heads With mutual Flattery's golden slime: And when the topmost height ye gain, And stand in Glory's ether clear, And grasp the prize of all your pain— So many hundred pounds a year— Then let Fame's banner be unfurled! Sing Pæans for a victory won! Ye tapers, that would light the world, And cast a shadow on the Sun— Who still shall pour His rays sublime, One crystal flood, from East to West, When ye have burned your little time And feebly flickered into rest!</field>

A MONODY, BY A VICTIM “My mother bids me bind my hair,” And not go about such a figure; It's a bother, of course, but what do I care? I shall do as I please when I'm bigger. “My lodging is on the cold, cold ground,” As the first-floor and attic were taken. I tried the garret but once, and found That my wish for a change was mistaken. “Ever of thee!” yes, “Ever of thee!” They chatter more and more, Till I groan aloud, “Oh! let me be! I have heard it all before!” “Please remember the organ, sir,” What? hasn't he left me yet? I promise, good man; for its tedious burr I never can forget. 1861. MY FANCY I painted her a gushing thing, With years perhaps a score; I little thought to find they were At least a dozen more; My fancy gave her eyes of blue, A curly auburn head: I came to find the blue a green, The auburn turned to red. She boxed my ears this morning, They tingled very much; I own that I could wish her A somewhat lighter touch; And if you were to ask me how Her charms might be improved, I would not have them added to, But just a few removed! She has the bear's ethereal grace, The bland hyena's laugh, The footstep of the elephant, The neck of the giraffe; I love her still, believe me, Though my heart its passion hides; “She's all my fancy painted her,” But oh! how much besides! Mar. 15, 1862. THE MAJESTY OF JUSTICE AN OXFORD IDYLL They passed beneath the College gate; And down the High went slowly on; Then spake the Undergraduate To that benign and portly Don: “They say that Justice is a Queen— A Queen of awful Majesty— Yet in the papers I have seen Some things that puzzle me. “A Court obscure, so rumour states, There is, called ‘Vice-Cancellarii,’ Which keeps on Undergraduates, Who do not pay their bills, a wary eye. A case I'm told was lately brought Into that tiniest of places, And justice in that case was sought— As in most other cases. “Well! Justice as I hold, dear friend, Is Justice, neither more than less: I never dreamed it could depend On ceremonial or dress. I thought that her imperial sway In Oxford surely would appear, But all the papers seem to say She's not majestic here.” The portly Don he made reply, With the most roguish of his glances, “Perhaps she drops her Majesty Under peculiar circumstances.” “But that's the point!” the young man cried, “The puzzle that I wish to pen you in— How are the public to decide Which article is genuine? “Is't only when the Court is large That we for ‘Majesty’ need hunt? Would what is Justice in a barge Be something different in a punt? “Nay, nay!” the Don replied, amused, “You're talking nonsense, sir! You know it! Such arguments were never used By any friend of Jowett.” “Then is it in the men who trudge (Beef-eaters I believe they call them) Before each wigged and ermined judge, For fear some mischief should befall them? If I should recognise in one (Through all disguise) my own domestic, I fear 'twould shed a gleam of fun Even on the ‘Majestic’!” The portly Don replied, “Ahem! They can't exactly be its essence: I scarcely think the want of them The ‘Majesty of Justice’ lessens. Besides, they always march awry; Their gorgeous garments never fit: Processions don't make Majesty— I'm quite convinced of it.” “Then is it in the wig it lies, Whose countless rows of rigid curls Are gazed at with admiring eyes By country lads and servant-girls?” Out laughed that bland and courteous Don: “Dear sir, I do not mean to flatter— But surely you have hit upon The essence of the matter. “They will not own the Majesty Of Justice, making Monarchs bow, Unless as evidence they see The horsehair wig upon her brow. Yes, yes! That makes the silliest men Seem wise; the meanest men look big: The Majesty of Justice, then, Is seated in the WIG.” March 1863. FROM NOTES BY AN OXFORD CHIEL THE ELECTIONS TO THE HEBDOMADAL COUNCIL “Now is the winter of our discontent.” Dr. Wynter, President of St. John's, one of the recently elected Conservative members of Council. [In the year 1866, a Letter with the above title was published in Oxford, addressed by Mr. Goldwin Smith to the Senior Censor of Christ Church, with the two-fold object of revealing to the University a vast political misfortune which it had unwittingly encountered, and of suggesting a remedy which should at once alleviate the bitterness of the calamity and secure the sufferers from its recurrence. The misfortune thus revealed was no less than the fact that, at a recent election of Members to the Hebdomadal Council, two Conservatives had been chosen, thus giving a Conservative majority in the Council; and the remedy suggested was a sufficiently sweeping one, embracing, as it did, the following details:— 1. “The exclusion” (from Congregation) “of the non-academical elements which form a main part of the strength of this party domination.” These “elements” are afterwards enumerated as “the parish clergy and the professional men of the city, and chaplains who are without any academical occupation.” 2. The abolition of the Hebdomadal Council. 3. The abolition of the legislative functions of Convocation. These are all the main features of this remarkable scheme of Reform, unless it be necessary to add— 4.“To preside over a Congregation with full legislative powers, the Vice-Chancellor ought no doubt to be a man of real capacity.” But it would be invidious to suppose that there was any intention of suggesting this as a novelty. The following rhythmical version of the Letter develops its principles to an extent which possibly the writer had never contemplated.] “Heard ye the arrow hurtle in the sky? Heard ye the dragon-monster's dreadful cry?”— Excuse this sudden burst of the Heroic; The present state of things would vex a Stoic! And just as Sairey Gamp, for pains within, Administered a modicum of gin, So does my mind, when vexed and ill at ease, Console itself with soothing similes, The “dragon-monster” (pestilential schism!) I need not tell you is Conservatism. The “hurtling arrow” (till we find a better) Is represented by the present Letter. 'Twas, I remember, but the other day, Dear Senior Censor, that you chanced to say You thought these party-combinations would Be found, “though needful, no unmingled good.” Unmingled good? They are unmingled ill! “In a letter on a point connected with the late elections to the Hebdomadal Council you incidentally remarked to me that our combinations for these elections, ‘though necessary were not an unmixed good.’ They are an unmixed evil.” I never took to them, and never will— “I never go to a caucus without reluctance: I never write a canvassing letter without a feeling of repugnance to my task.” What am I saying? Heed it not, my friend: On the next page I mean to recommend The very dodges that I now condemn In the Conservatives! Don't hint to them A word of this! (In confidence. Ahem!) Need I rehearse the history of Jowett? I need not, Senior Censor, for you know it. “I need not rehearse the history of the Regius Professor of Greek.” That was the Board Hebdomadal, and oh! Who would be free, themselves must strike the blow! Let each that wears a beard, and each that shaves, Join in the cry “We never will be slaves!” “But can the University afford To be a slave to any kind of board? A slave?” you shuddering ask. “Think you it can, Sir?” “Not at the present moment,” is my answer. “The University cannot afford at the present moment to be delivered over as a slave to any non-academical interest whatever.” I've thought the matter o'er and o'er again And given to it all my powers of brain; I've thought it out, and this is what I make it, (And I don't care a Tory how you take it:) It may be right to go ahead, I guess: It may be right to stop, I do confess; Also, it may be right to retrogress. “It may be right to go on, it may be right to stand still, or it may be right to go back.” So says the oracle, and, for myself, I Must say it beats to fits the one at Delphi! To save beloved Oxford from the yoke, (For this majority's beyond a joke), We must combine, “To save the University from going completely under the yoke . . . we shall still be obliged to combine.” aye! hold a caucus-meeting, “Caucus-holding and wire-pulling would still be almost inevitably carried on to some extent.” Unless we want to get another beating. That they should “bottle” us is nothing new— But shall they bottle us and caucus too? See the “fell unity of purpose” now With which Obstructives plunge into the row! “But what are we to do? Here is a great political and theological party . . . labouring under perfect discipline and with fell unity of purpose, to hold the University in subjection, and fill her government with its nominees.” “Factious Minorities,” we used to sigh— “Factious Majorities” is now the cry. “Votes—ninety-two”—no combination here: “Votes—ninety-three”—conspiracy, 'tis clear! At a recent election to Council, the Liberals mustered ninety-two votes and the Conservatives ninety-three; whereupon the latter were charged with having obtained their victory by a conspiracy. You urge “'Tis but a unit.” I reply That in that unit lurks their “unity.” Our voters often bolt, and often baulk us, But then, they never, never go to caucus! Our voters can't forget the maxim famous “Semel electum semper eligamus”: They never can be worked into a ferment By visionary promise of preferment, Nor taught, by hints of “Paradise” Not to mention that, as we cannot promise Paradise to our supporters, they are very apt to take the train for London just before the election. beguiled, To whisper “C for Chairman” like a child! It is not known to what the word “Paradise” was intended to allude, and therefore the hint, here thrown out, that the writer meant to recall the case of the late Chairman of Mr. Gladstone's committee, who had been recently collated to the See of Chester, is wholly wanton and gratuitous. And thus the friends that we have tempted down Oft take the two-o'clock Express for town. A case of this kind had actually occurred on the occasion of the division just alluded to. This is our danger: this the secret foe That aims at Oxford such a deadly blow. What champion can we find to save the State, To crush the plot? We darkly whisper “Wait!” Mr. Wayte, now President of Trinity, then put forward as the Liberal candidate for election to Council. My scheme is this: remove the votes of all The residents that are not Liberal— “You and others suggest, as the only effective remedy, that the Constituency should be reformed, by the exclusion of the non-academical elements which form a main part of the strength of this party domination.” Leave the young Tutors uncontrolled and free, And Oxford then shall see—what it shall see. What next? Why then, I say, let Convocation Be shorn of all her powers of legislation. “I confess that, having included all the really academical elements in Congregation, I would go boldly on, and put an end to the Legislative functions of Convocation.” But why stop there? Let us go boldly on— Sweep everything beginning with a “Con” Into oblivion! Convocation first, Conservatism next, and, last and worst, “Concilium Hebdomadale” must, Consumed and conquered, be consigned to dust! “This conviction, that while we have Elections to Council we shall not entirely get rid of party organization and its evils, leads me to venture a step further, and to raise the question whether it is really necessary that we should have an Elective Council for legislative purposes at all.” And here I must relate a little fable I heard last Saturday at our high table:— The cats, it seems, were masters of the house, And held their own against the rat and mouse: Of course the others couldn't stand it long, So held a caucus (not, in their case, wrong); And, when they were assembled to a man, Uprose an aged rat, and thus began:— “Brothers in bondage! Shall we bear to be For ever left in a minority? With what ‘fell unity of purpose’ cats Oppose the trusting innocence of rats! So unsuspicious are we of disguise, Their machinations take us by surprise— “Sometimes, indeed, not being informed that the wires are at work, we are completely taken by surprise.” Insulting and tyrannical absurdities! “We are without protection against this most insulting and tyrannical absurdity.” It is too bad by half—upon my word it is! For, now that these Con—, cats, I should say (frizzle 'em!), Are masters, they exterminate like Islam! “It is as exterminating as Islam.” How shall we deal with them? I'll tell you how:— Let none but kittens be allowed to miaow! The Liberal kittens seize us but in play, And, while they frolic, we can run away; But older cats are not so generous, Their claws are too Conservative for us! Then let them keep the stable and the oats, While kittens, rats, and mice have all the votes. “Yes; banish cats! The kittens would not use Their powers for blind obstruction, “Their powers would scarcely be exercised for the purposes of fanaticism, or in a spirit of blind obstruction.” nor refuse To let us sip the cream and gnaw the cheese— How glorious then would be our destinies! “These narrow local bounds, within which our thoughts and schemes have hitherto been pent, will begin to disappear, and a far wider sphere of action will open on the view.” Kittens and rats would occupy the throne, And rule the larder for itself alone!” “Those councils must be freely opened to all who can serve her well and who will serve her for herself.” So rhymed my friend, and asked me what I thought of it. I told him that so much as I had caught of it Appeared to me (as I need hardly mention) Entirely undeserving of attention. But now, to guide the Congregation, when It numbers none but really “able” men, A “Vice-Cancellarius” will be needed Of every kind of human weakness weeded! Is such the president that we have got? He ought no doubt to be; why should he not? “To preside over a Congregation with full legislative powers, the Vice-Chancellor ought no doubt to be a man of real capacity; but why should he not? His mind ought also, for this as well as for his other high functions, to be clear of petty details, and devoted to the great matters of University business; but why should not this condition also be fulfilled?” I do not hint that Liberals should dare To oust the present holder of the chair— But surely he would not object to be Gently examined by a Board of three? Their duty being just to ascertain That he's “all there” (I mean, of course, in brain), And that his mind, from “petty details” clear, Is fitted for the duties of his sphere. All this is merely moonshine, till we get The seal of Parliament upon it set. A word then, Senior Censor, in your ear: The Government is in a state of fear— Like some old gentleman, abroad at night, Seized with a sudden shiver of affright, Who offers money, on his bended knees, To the first skulking vagabond he sees— Now is the lucky moment for our task; They daren't refuse us anything we ask! “If you apply now to Parliament for this or any other University reform, you will find the House of Commons in a propitious mood. . . . Even the Conservative Government, as it looks for the support of moderate Liberals on the one great subject, is very unwilling to present itself in such an aspect that these men may not be able decently to give it their support.” And then our Fellowships shall open be To Intellect, no meaner quality! No moral excellence, no social fitness Shall ever be admissible as witness. “Avaunt, dull Virtue!” is Oxonia's cry: “Come to my arms, ingenious Villainy!” For Classic Fellowships, an honour high, Simonides and Co. will then apply— Our Mathematics will to Oxford bring The 'cutest members of the betting-ring— Law Fellowships will start upon their journeys A myriad of unscrupulous attorneys— While prisoners, doomed till now to toil unknown, Shall mount the Physical Professor's throne! And thus would Oxford educate, indeed, Men far beyond a merely local need— With no career before them, I may say, “With open Fellowships, Oxford will soon produce a supply of men fit for the work of high education far beyond her own local demands, and in fact with no career before them unless a career can be opened elsewhere.” Unless they're wise enough to go away, And seek far West, or in the distant East, Another flock of pigeons to be fleeced. I might go on, and trace the destiny Of Oxford in an age which, though it be Thus breaking with tradition, owns a new Allegiance to the intellectual few— (I mean, of course, the—pshaw! no matter who!) But, were I to pursue the boundless theme, I fear that I should seem to you to dream. “I should seem to you to dream if I were to say what I think the destiny of the University may be in an age which, though it is breaking with tradition, is, from the same causes, owning a new allegiance to intellectual authority.” This to fulfil, or even—humbler far— To shun Conservatism's noxious star And all the evils that it brings behind, These pestilential coils must be untwined— The party-coils, that clog the march of Mind— Choked in whose meshes Oxford, slowly wise, Has lain for three disastrous centuries. “But to fulfil this, or even a far humbler destiny—to escape the opposite lot—the pestilential coils of party, in which the University has lain for three disastrous centuries choked, must be untwined.” Away with them! (It is for this I yearn!) Each twist untwist, each Turner overturn! Disfranchise each Conservative, and cancel The votes of Michell, Liddon, Wall, and Mansel! Then, then shall Oxford be herself again, Neglect the heart, and cultivate the brain— Then this shall be the burden of our song, “All change is good—whatever is, is wrong—” Then Intellect's proud flag shall be unfurled, And Brain, and Brain alone, shall rule the world! THE DESERTED PARKS “Solitudinem faciunt: Parcum appellant.” Museum! loveliest building of the plain Where Cherwell winds towards the distant main; How often have I loitered o'er thy green, Where humble happiness endeared the scene! How often have I paused on every charm, The rustic couple walking arm in arm— The groups of trees, with seats beneath the shade For prattling babes and whisp'ring lovers made— The never-failing brawl, the busy mill Where tiny urchins vied in fistic skill— (Two phrases only have that dusky race Caught from the learned influence of the place; Phrases in their simplicity sublime, “Scramble a copper!” “Please, Sir, what's the time?” These round thy walks their cheerful influence shed; There were thy charms—but all these charms are fled. Amidst thy bowers the tyrant's hand is seen, And rude pavilions sadden all thy green; One selfish pastime grasps the whole domain, And half a faction swallows up the plain; Adown thy glades, all sacrificed to cricket, The hollow-sounding bat now guards the wicket; Sunk are thy mounds in shapeless level all, Lest aught impede the swiftly rolling ball; And trembling, shrinking from the fatal blow, Far, far away thy hapless children go. Ill fares the place, to luxury a prey, Where wealth accumulates, and minds decay; Athletic sports may flourish or may fade, Fashion may make them, even as it has made; But the broad parks, the city's joy and pride, When once destroyed can never be supplied! Ye friends to truth, ye statesmen, who survey The rich man's joys increase, the poor's decay, 'Tis yours to judge, how wide the limits stand Between a splendid and a happy land. Proud swells go by with laugh of hollow joy, And shouting Folly hails them with “Ahoy!” Funds even beyond the miser's wish abound, And rich men flock from all the world around. Yet count our gains. This wealth is but a name, That leaves our useful products still the same. Not so the loss. The man of wealth and pride Takes up a space that many poor supplied; Space for the game, and all its instruments, Space for pavilions and for scorers' tents; The ball, that raps his shins in padding cased, Has wore the verdure to an arid waste; His Park, where these exclusive sports are seen, Indignant spurns the rustic from the green; While through the plain, consigned to silence all, In barren splendour flits the russet ball. In peaceful converse with his brother Don, Here oft the calm Professor wandered on; Strange words he used—men drank with wondering ears The languages called “dead,” the tongues of other years. (Enough of Heber! Let me once again Attune my verse to Goldsmith's liquid strain.) A man he was to undergraduates dear, And passing rich with forty pounds a year. And so, I ween, he would have been till now, Had not his friends ('twere long to tell you how) Prevailed on him, Jack-Horner-like, to try Some method to evaluate his pie, And win from those dark depths, with skilful thumb, Five times a hundredweight of luscious plum— Yet for no thirst of wealth, no love of praise, In learned labour he consumed his days! O Luxury! thou cursed by Heaven's decree, How ill exchanged are things like these for thee! How do thy potions, with insidious joy, Diffuse their pleasures only to destroy; Iced cobbler, Badminton, and shandy-gaff, Rouse the loud jest and idiotic laugh; Inspired by them, to tipsy greatness grown, Men boast a florid vigour not their own; At every draught more wild and wild they grow; While pitying friends observe “I told you so!” Till, summoned to their post, at the first ball, A feeble under-hand, their wickets fall. Even now the devastation is begun, And half the business of destruction done; Even now, methinks while pondering here in pity, I see the rural Virtues leave the city. Contented Toil, and calm scholastic Care, And frugal Moderation, all are there; Resolute Industry that scorns the lure Of careless mirth—that dwells apart secure— To science gives her days, her midnight oil, Cheered by the sympathy of others' toil— Courtly Refinement, and that Taste in dress That brooks no meanness, yet avoids excess— All these I see, with slow reluctant pace Desert the long-beloved and honoured place! While yet 'tis time, Oxonia, rise and fling The spoiler from thee: grant no parleying! Teach him that eloquence, against the wrong, Though very poor, may still be very strong; That party-interests we must forgo, When hostile to “pro bono publico”; That faction's empire hastens to its end, When once mankind to common sense attend; While independent votes may win the day Even against the potent spell of “Play!” May 1867.

Three little maidens weary of the rail, Three pairs of little ears listening to a tale, Three little hands held out in readiness, For three little puzzles very hard to guess. Three pairs of little eyes, open wonder-wide, At three little scissors lying side by side. Three little mouths that thanked an unknown Friend, For one little book, he undertook to send. Though whether they'll remember a friend, or book, or day— In three little weeks is very hard to say. August 1869. DOUBLE ACROSTIC (To Miss E. M. Argles.)

Three little maids, one winter day, While others went to feed, To sing, to laugh, to dance, to play, More wisely went to—Reed. Others, when lesson-time's begun, Go, half inclined to cry, Some in a walk, some in a run; But these went in a—Fly. I give to other little maids A smile, a kiss, a look, Presents whose memory quickly fades; I give to these—a Book.

Three children (their names were so fearful You'll excuse me for leaving them out) Sat silent, with faces all tearful— What was it about? They were sewing, but needles are prickly, And fingers were cold as could be— So they didn't get on very quickly, And they wept, silly Three! “O Mother!” said they, “Guildford's not a Nice place for the winter, that's flat. If you know any country that's hotter, Please take us to that!” “Cease crying,” said she, “little daughter! And when summer comes back with the flowers, You shall roam by the edge of the water, In sunshiny hours.” “And in summer,” said sorrowful Mary, “We shall hear the shrill scream of the train That will bring that dear writer of fairy- tales hither again.” (Now the person she meant to allude to Was—well! it is best to forget. It was some one she always was rude to, Whenever they met.) “It's my duty,” their Mother continued, “To fill with things useful and right Your small minds: if I put nothing in, you'd Be ignorant quite. “But enough now of lessons and thinking: Your meal is quite ready, I see— So attend to your eating and drinking, You thirsty young Three!” Apr. 10, 1871. TWO THIEVES (To the Misses Drury.) Two thieves went out to steal one day Thinking that no one knew it: Three little maids, I grieve to say, Encouraged them to do it. 'Tis sad that little children should Encourage men in stealing! But these, I've always understood, Have got no proper feeling. An aged friend, who chanced to pass Exactly at the minute, Said “Children! Take this Looking-glass, And see your badness in it.” Jan. 11, 1872. TWO ACROSTICS (To Miss Ruth Dymes.)

Perchance, as long years onward haste, Laura will weary of the taste Of Life's embittered chalice: May she, in such a woeful hour, Endued with Memory's mystic power, Recall the dreams of Alice!

I know it, Maiden, when I see A fairy-tale upon your knee— And note the page that idly lingers Beneath those still and listless fingers— And mark those dreamy looks that stray To some bright vision far away, Still seeking, in the pictured story, The memory of a vanished glory. ACROSTIC (To Miss Marion Terry.) Maiden, though thy heart may quail And thy quivering lip grow pale, Read the Bellman's tragic tale! Is it life of which it tells? Of a pulse that sinks and swells Never lacking chime of bells? Bells of sorrow, bells of cheer, Easter, Christmas, glad New Year, Still they sound, afar, anear. So may Life's sweet bells for thee, In the summers yet to be, Evermore make melody! Aug. 15, 1876. MADRIGAL (To Miss May Forshall.) He shouts amain, he shouts again, (Her brother, fierce, as bluff King Hal), “I tell you flat, I shall do that!” She softly whispers “‘May’ for ‘shall’!” He wistful sighed one eventide (Her friend, that made this Madrigal), “And shall I kiss you, pretty Miss!” Smiling she answered “‘May’ for ‘shall’!” With eager eyes my reader cries, “Your friend must be indeed a val- -uable child, so sweet, so mild! What do you call her?” “May For shall.” Dec. 24, 1877. LOVE AMONG THE ROSES ACROSTIC “Seek ye Love, ye fairy-sprites? Ask where reddest roses grow. Rosy fancies he invites, And in roses he delights, Have ye found him?” “No!” “Seek again, and find the boy In Childhood's heart, so pure and clear.” Now the fairies leap for joy, Crying, “Love is here!” “Love has found his proper nest; And we guard him while he dozes In a dream of peace and rest Rosier than roses.” Jan. 3, 1878. TWO POEMS TO RACHEL DANIEL I [“Oh pudgy podgy pup!] “Oh pudgy podgy pup! Why did they wake you up? Those crude nocturnal yells Are not like silver bells: Nor ever would recall Sweet Music's ‘dying fall.’ They rather bring to mind The bitter winter wind Through keyholes shrieking shrilly When nights are dark and chilly: Or like some dire duett, Or quarrelsome quartette, Of cats who chant their joys With execrable noise, And murder Time and Tune To vex the patient Moon!” Nov. 1880. II FOR “THE GARLAND OF RACHEL” (1881) What hand may wreathe thy natal crown, O tiny tender Spirit-blossom, That out of Heaven hast fluttered down Into this Earth's cold bosom? And how shall mortal bard aspire— All sin-begrimed and sorrow-laden— To welcome, with the Seraph-choir, A pure and perfect Maiden? Are not God's minstrels ever near, Flooding with joy the woodland mazes? Which shall we summon, Baby dear, To carol forth thy praises? With sweet sad song the Nightingale May soothe the broken hearts that languish Where graves are green—the orphans' wail, The widow's lonely anguish: The Turtle-dove with amorous coo May chide the blushing maid that lingers To twine her bridal wreath anew With weak and trembling fingers: But human loves and human woes Would dim the radiance of thy glory— Only the Lark such music knows As fits thy stainless story. The world may listen as it will— She recks not, to the skies up-springing: Beyond our ken she singeth still For very joy of singing. THE LYCEUM “It is the lawyer's daughter, And she is grown so dear, so dear, She costs me, in one evening, The income of a year! ‘You can't have children's love,’ she cried, ‘Unless you choose to fee 'em!’ ‘And what's your fee, child?’ I replied. She simply said ? “We saw ‘The Cup.’” I hoped she'd say, “I'm grateful to you, very.” She murmured, as she turned away, “That lovely [Ellen Terry.] “Compared with her, the rest,” she cried, “Are just like two or three um- “berellas standing side by side! “Oh, gem of ? “We saw Two Brothers. I confess To me they seemed one man. “Now which is which, child? Can you guess?” She cried, “A-course I can!” Bad puns like this I always dread, And am resolved to flee 'em. And so I left her there, and fled; She lives at ? 1881. ACROSTIC [Around my lonely hearth to-night] Around my lonely hearth to-night, Ghostlike the shadows wander: Now here, now there, a childish sprite, Earthborn and yet as angel bright, Seems near me as I ponder. Gaily she shouts: the laughing air Echoes her note of gladness— Or bends herself with earnest care Round fairy-fortress to prepare Grim battlement or turret-stair— In childhood's merry madness! New raptures still hath youth in store. Age may but fondly cherish Half-faded memories of yore— Up, craven heart! repine no more! Love stretches hands from shore to shore: Love is, and shall not perish! DREAMLAND (Verses written to the dream-music written down by C. E. Hutchinson, of Brasenose College.) When midnight mists are creeping, And all the land is sleeping, Around me tread the mighty dead, And slowly pass away. Lo, warriors, saints, and sages, From out the vanished ages, With solemn pace and reverend face Appear and pass away. The blaze of noonday splendour, The twilight soft and tender, May charm the eye: yet they shall die, Shall die and pass away. But here, in Dreamland's centre, No spoiler's hand may enter, These visions fair, this radiance rare, Shall never pass away. I see the shadows falling, The forms of old recalling; Around me tread the mighty dead, And slowly pass away. 1882. TO MY CHILD-FRIEND DEDICATION TO “THE GAME OF LOGIC” I charm in vain: for never again, All keenly as my glance I bend, Will Memory, goddess coy, Embody for my joy Departed days, nor let me gaze On thee, my Fairy Friend! Yet could thy face, in mystic grace, A moment smile on me, 'twould send Far-darting rays of light From Heaven athwart the night, By which to read in very deed Thy spirit, sweetest Friend! So may the stream of Life's long dream Flow gently onward to its end, With many a floweret gay, A-down its willowy way: May no sigh vex, no care perplex, My loving little Friend! 1886. A RIDDLE (To Miss Gaynor Simpson.) My first lends his aid when I plunge into trade: My second in jollifications: My whole, laid on thinnish, imparts a neat finish To pictorial representations. Answer. Copal. A LIMERICK (To Miss Vera Beringer.) There was a young lady of station, “I love man” was her sole exclamation; But when men cried, “You flatter,” She replied, “Oh! no matter, Isle of Man is the true explanation.” RHYME? AND REASON? (To Miss Emmie Drury.) “I'm EMInent in RHYME!” she said. “I make WRY Mouths of RYE-Meal gruel!” The Poet smiled, and shook his head: “Is REASON, then, the missing jewel?” A NURSERY DARLING DEDICATION TO THE NURSERY “ALICE,” 1889 A Mother's breast: Safe refuge from her childish fears, From childish troubles, childish tears, Mists that enshroud her dawning years! See how in sleep she seems to sing A voiceless psalm—an offering Raised, to the glory of her King, In Love: for Love is Rest. A Darling's kiss: Dearest of all the signs that fleet From lips that lovingly repeat Again, again, their message sweet! Full to the brim with girlish glee, A child, a very child is she, Whose dream of Heaven is still to be At Home: for Home is Bliss. MAGGIE'S VISIT TO OXFORD (June 9th to 13th, 1889) (Written for Maggie Bowman.) When Maggie once to Oxford came, On tour as “Bootles Baby,” She said, “I'll see this place of fame, However dull the day be.” So with her friend she visited The sights that it was rich in: And first of all she popped her head Inside the Christ Church kitchen. The Cooks around that little child Stood waiting in a ring: And every time that Maggie smiled Those Cooks began to sing— Shouting the Battle-cry of Freedom! “Roast, boil and bake, For Maggie's sake: Bring cutlets fine For her to dine, Meringues so sweet For her to eat— For Maggie may be Bootles' Baby!” Then hand in hand in pleasant talk They wandered and admired The Hall, Cathedral and Broad Walk, Till Maggie's feet were tired: To Worcester Garden next they strolled, Admired its quiet lake: Then to St. John, a college old, Their devious way they take. In idle mood they sauntered round Its lawn so green and flat, And in that garden Maggie found A lovely Pussy-Cat! A quarter of an hour they spent In wandering to and fro: And everywhere that Maggie went, The Cat was sure to go— Shouting the Battle-cry of Freedom! “Maiow! Maiow! Come, make your bow, Take off your hats, Ye Pussy-Cats! And purr and purr, To welcome her, For Maggie may be Bootles' Baby!” So back to Christ Church, not too late For them to go and see A Christ Church undergraduate, Who gave them cakes and tea. Next day she entered with her guide The garden called “Botanic,” And there a fierce Wild Boar she spied, Enough to cause a panic: But Maggie didn't mind, not she, She would have faced, alone, That fierce wild boar, because, you see, The thing was made of stone. On Magdalen walls they saw a face That filled her with delight, A giant face, that made grimace And grinned with all its might. A little friend, industrious, Pulled upwards all the while The corner of its mouth, and thus He helped that face to smile! “How nice,” thought Maggie, “it would be If I could have a friend To do that very thing for me And make my mouth turn up with glee, By pulling at one end.” In Magdalen Park the deer are wild With joy, that Maggie brings Some bread a friend had given the child, To feed the pretty things. They flock round Maggie without fear: They breakfast and they lunch, They dine, they sup, those happy deer— Still, as they munch and munch, Shouting the Battle-cry of Freedom! “Yes, Deer are we, And dear is she! We love this child So sweet and mild: We all rejoice At Maggie's voice: We all are fed With Maggie's bread ... For Maggie may be Bootles' Baby!” They met a Bishop on their way ... A Bishop large as life, With loving smile that seemed to say “Will Maggie be my wife?” Maggie thought not, because, you see, She was so very young, And he was old as old could be ... So Maggie held her tongue. “My Lord, she's Bootles' Baby, we Are going up and down,” Her friend explained, “that she may see The sights of Oxford Town.” “Now say what kind of place it is,” The Bishop gaily cried. “The best place in the Provinces!” That little maid replied. Away, next morning, Maggie went From Oxford town: but yet The happy hours she there had spent She could not soon forget. The train is gone, it rumbles on: The engine-whistle screams; But Maggie deep in rosy sleep ... And softly in her dreams, Whispers the Battle-cry of Freedom. “Oxford, good-bye!” She seems to sigh. “You dear old City, With gardens pretty, And lanes and flowers, And college-towers, And Tom's great Bell ... Farewell—farewell: For Maggie may be Bootles' Baby!” MAGGIE B? (To Maggie Bowman) Written by Maggie B? Bought by me: A present to Maggie B? Sent by me: But who can Maggie be? Answered by me: “She is she.” Aug. 13, 1891. THREE SUNSETS AND OTHER POEMS THREE SUNSETS He saw her once, and in the glance, A moment's glance of meeting eyes, His heart stood still in sudden trance: He trembled with a sweet surprise— All in the waning light she stood, The star of perfect womanhood. That summer-eve his heart was light: With lighter step he trod the ground: And life was fairer in his sight, And music was in every sound: He blessed the world where there could be So beautiful a thing as she. There once again, as evening fell And stars were peering overhead, Two lovers met to bid farewell: The western sun gleamed faint and red, Lost in a drift of purple cloud That wrapped him like a funeral-shroud. Long time the memory of that night— The hand that clasped, the lips that kissed, The form that faded from his sight Slow sinking through the tearful mist— In dreamy music seemed to roll Through the dark chambers of his soul. So after many years he came A wanderer from a distant shore: The street, the house, were still the same, But those he sought were there no more: His burning words, his hopes and fears, Unheeded fell on alien ears. Only the children from their play Would pause the mournful tale to hear, Shrinking in half-alarm away, Or, step by step, would venture near To touch with timid curious hands That strange wild man from other lands. He sat beside the busy street, There, where he last had seen her face; And thronging memories, bitter-sweet, Seemed yet to haunt the ancient place: Her footfall ever floated near: Her voice was ever in his ear. He sometimes, as the daylight waned And evening mists began to roll, In half-soliloquy complained Of that black shadow on his soul, And blindly fanned, with cruel care, The ashes of a vain despair. The summer fled: the lonely man Still lingered out the lessening days: Still, as the night drew on, would scan Each passing face with closer gaze— Till, sick at heart, he turned away, And sighed “She will not come to-day.” So by degrees his spirit bent To mock its own despairing cry, In stern self-torture to invent New luxuries of agony, And people all the vacant space With visions of her perfect face. Then for a moment she was nigh, He heard no step, but she was there; As if an angel suddenly Were bodied from the viewless air, And all her fine ethereal frame Should fade as swiftly as it came. So, half in fancy's sunny trance, And half in misery's aching void, With set and stony countenance His bitter being he enjoyed, And thrust for ever from his mind The happiness he could not find. As when the wretch, in lonely room, To selfish death is madly hurled, The glamour of that fatal fume Shuts out the wholesome living world— So all his manhood's strength and pride One sickly dream had swept aside. Yea, brother, and we passed him there, But yesterday, in merry mood, And marvelled at the lordly air That shamed his beggar's attitude, Nor heeded that ourselves might be Wretches as desperate as he; Who let the thought of bliss denied Make havoc of our life and powers, And pine, in solitary pride, For peace that never shall be ours, Because we will not work and wait In trustful patience for our fate. And so it chanced once more that she Came by the old familiar spot: The face he would have died to see Bent o'er him, and he knew it not; Too rapt in selfish grief to hear, Even when happiness was near. And pity filled her gentle breast For him that would not stir nor speak, The dying crimson of the west, That faintly tinged his haggard cheek, Fell on her as she stood, and shed A glory round the patient head. Ah, let him wake! The moments fly: This awful tryst may be the last. And see, the tear, that dimmed her eye, Had fallen on him ere she passed— She passed: the crimson paled to gray: And hope departed with the day. The heavy hours of night went by, And silence quickened into sound, And light slid up the eastern sky, And life began its daily round— But light and life for him were fled: His name was numbered with the dead. Nov. 1861. THE PATH OF ROSES (Florence Nightingale was at the height of her fame when this was written, after the Crimean War.) In the dark silence of an ancient room, Whose one tall window fronted to the West, Where, through laced tendrils of a hanging vine, The sunset-glow was fading into night, Sat a pale Lady, resting weary hands Upon a great clasped volume, and her face Within her hands. Not as in rest she bowed, But large hot tears were coursing down her cheek, And her low-panted sobs broke awefully Upon the sleeping echoes of the night. Soon she unclasp'd the volume once again, And read the words in tone of agony, As in self-torture, weeping as she read:— “He crowns the glory of his race: He prayeth but in some fit place To meet his foeman face to face: “And, battling for the True, the Right, From ruddy dawn to purple night, To perish in the midmost fight: “Where hearts are fierce and hands are strong, Where peals the bugle loud and long, Where blood is dropping in the throng: “Still, with a dim and glazing eye, To watch the tide of victory, To hear in death the battle-cry: “Then, gathered grandly to his grave, To rest among the true and brave, In holy ground, where yew-trees wave: “Where, from church-windows sculptured fair, Float out upon the evening air The note of praise, the voice of prayer: “Where no vain marble mockery Insults with loud and boastful lie The simple soldier's memory: “Where sometimes little children go, And read, in whisper'd accent slow, The name of him who sleeps below.” Her voice died out: like one in dreams she sat. “Alas!” she sighed. “For what can Woman do? Her life is aimless, and her death unknown: Hemmed in by social forms she pines in vain. Man has his work, but what can Woman do?” And answer came there from the creeping gloom, The creeping gloom that settled into night: “Peace! For thy lot is other than a man's: His is a path of thorns: he beats them down: He faces death: he wrestles with despair. Thine is of roses, to adorn and cheer His lonely life, and hide the thorns in flowers.” She spake again: in bitter tone she spake: “Aye, as a toy, the puppet of an hour, Or a fair posy, newly plucked at morn, But flung aside and withered ere the night.” And answer came there from the creeping gloom, The creeping gloom that blackened into night: “So shalt thou be the lamp to light his path, What time the shades of sorrow close around.” And, so it seemed to her, an awful light Pierced slowly through the darkness, orbed, and grew, Until all passed away—the ancient room— The sunlight dying through the trellised vine— The one tall window—all had passed away, And she was standing on the mighty hills. Beneath, around, and far as eye could see, Squadron on squadron, stretched opposing hosts, Ranked as for battle, mute and motionless. Anon a distant thunder shook the ground, The tramp of horses, and a troop shot by— Plunged headlong in that living sea of men— Plunged to their death: back from that fatal field A scattered handful, fighting hard for life, Broke through the serried lines; but, as she gazed, They shrank and melted, and their forms grew thin— Grew pale as ghosts when the first morning ray Dawns from the East—the trumpet's brazen blare Died into silence—and the vision passed— Passed to a room where sick and dying lay In long, sad line—there brooded Fear and Pain— Darkness was there, the shade of Azrael's wing. But there was one that ever, to and fro, Moved with light footfall: purely calm her face, And those deep steadfast eyes that starred the gloom: Still, as she went, she ministered to each Comfort and counsel; cooled the fevered brow With softest touch, and in the listening ear Of the pale sufferer whispered words of peace. That dying warrior, gazing as she passed, Clasped his thin hands and blessed her. Bless her too, Thou, who didst bless the merciful of old! So prayed the Lady, watching tearfully Her gentle moving onward, till the night Had veiled her wholly, and the vision passed. Then once again the solemn whisper came: “So in the darkest path of man's despair, Where War and Terror shake the troubled earth, Lies woman's mission; with unblenching brow To pass through scenes of horror and affright Where men grow sick and tremble: unto her All things are sanctified, for all are good. Nothing so mean, but shall deserve her care: Nothing so great, but she may bear her part. No life is vain: each hath his place assigned: Do thou thy task, and leave the rest to God.” And there was silence, but the Lady made No answer, save one deeply-breathed “Amen.” And she arose, and in that darkening room Stood lonely as a spirit of the night— Stood calm and fearless in the gathered night— And raised her eyes to heaven. There were tears Upon her face, but in her heart was peace, Peace that the world nor gives nor takes away! April 10, 1856. THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH Hark, said the dying man, and sighed, To that complaining tone— Like sprite condemned, each eventide, To walk the world alone. At sunset, when the air is still, I hear it creep from yonder hill: It breathes upon me, dead and chill, A moment, and is gone. My son, it minds me of a day Left half a life behind, That I have prayed to put away For ever from my mind. But bitter memory will not die: It haunts my soul when none is nigh: I hear its whisper in the sigh Of that complaining wind. And now in death my soul is fain To tell the tale of fear That hidden in my breast hath lain Through many a weary year: Yet time would fail to utter all— The evil spells that held me thrall, And thrust my life from fall to fall, Thou needest not to hear. The spells that bound me with a chain, Sin's stern behests to do, Till Pleasure's self, invoked in vain, A heavy burden grew— Till from my spirit's fevered eye, A hunted thing, I seemed to fly Through the dark woods that underlie Yon mountain-range of blue. Deep in those woods I found a vale No sunlight visiteth, Nor star, nor wandering moonbeam pale; Where never comes the breath Of summer-breeze—there in mine ear, Even as I lingered half in fear, I heard a whisper, cold and clear, “That is the gate of Death. “O bitter is it to abide In weariness alway: At dawn to sigh for eventide, At eventide for day. Thy noon hath fled: thy sun hath shone: The brightness of thy day is gone: What need to lag and linger on Till life be cold and gray? “O well,” it said, “beneath yon pool, In some still cavern deep, The fevered brain might slumber cool, The eyes forget to weep: Within that goblet's mystic rim Are draughts of healing, stored for him Whose heart is sick, whose sight is dim, Who prayeth but to sleep!” The evening-breeze went moaning by, Like mourner for the dead, And stirred, with shrill complaining sigh, The tree-tops overhead: My guardian-angel seemed to stand And mutely wave a warning hand— With sudden terror all unmanned, I turned myself and fled! A cottage-gate stood open wide: Soft fell the dying ray On two fair children, side by side, That rested from their play— Together bent the earnest head, As ever and anon they read From one dear Book: the words they said Come back to me to-day. Like twin cascades on mountain-stair Together wandered down The ripples of the golden hair, The ripples of the brown: While, through the tangled silken haze, Blue eyes looked forth in eager gaze, More starlike than the gems that blaze About a monarch's crown. My son, there comes to each an hour When sinks the spirit's pride— When weary hands forget their power The strokes of death to guide: In such a moment, warriors say, A word the panic-rout may stay, A sudden charge redeem the day And turn the living tide. I could not see, for blinding tears, The glories of the west: A heavenly music filled mine ears, A heavenly peace my breast. “Come unto Me, come unto Me— All ye that labour, unto Me— Ye heavy-laden, come to Me— And I will give you rest.” The night drew onwards: thin and blue The evening mists arise To bathe the thirsty land in dew, As erst in Paradise— While, over silent field and town, The deep blue vault of heaven looked down; Not, as of old, in angry frown, But bright with angels' eyes. Blest day! Then first I heard the voice That since hath oft beguiled These eyes from tears, and bid rejoice This heart with anguish wild— Thy mother, boy, thou hast not known; So soon she left me here to moan— Left me to weep and watch, alone, Our one beloved child. Though, parted from my aching sight, Like homeward-speeding dove, She passed into the perfect light That floods the world above; Yet our twin spirits, well I know— Though one abide in pain below— Love, as in summers long ago, And evermore shall love. So with a glad and patient heart I move toward mine end: The streams, that flow awhile apart, Shall both in ocean blend. I dare not weep: I can but bless The Love that pitied my distress, And lent me, in Life's wilderness, So sweet and true a friend. But if there be—O if there be A truth in what they say, That angel-forms we cannot see Go with us on our way; Then surely she is with me here, I dimly feel her spirit near— The morning-mists grow thin and clear, And Death brings in the Day. April 1868. SOLITUDE I love the stillness of the wood: I love the music of the rill: I love to couch in pensive mood Upon some silent hill. Scarce heard, beneath yon arching trees, The silver-crested ripples pass; And, like a mimic brook, the breeze Whispers among the grass. Here from the world I win release, Nor scorn of men, nor footstep rude, Break in to mar the holy peace Of this great solitude. Here may the silent tears I weep Lull the vexed spirit into rest, As infants sob themselves to sleep Upon a mother's breast. But when the bitter hour is gone, And the keen throbbing pangs are still, Oh, sweetest then to couch alone Upon some silent hill! To live in joys that once have been, To put the cold world out of sight, And deck life's drear and barren scene With hues of rainbow-light. For what to man the gift of breath, If sorrow be his lot below; If all the day that ends in death Be dark with clouds of woe? Shall the poor transport of an hour Repay long years of sore distress— The fragrance of a lonely flower Make glad the wilderness? Ye golden hours of Life's young spring, Of innocence, of love and truth! Bright, beyond all imagining, Thou fairy-dream of youth! I'd give all wealth that years have piled, The slow result of Life's decay, To be once more a little child For once bright summer-day. March 16, 1853. BEATRICE In her eyes is the living light Of a wanderer to earth From a far celestial height: Summers five are all the span— Summers five since Time began To veil in mists of human night A shining angel-birth. Does an angel look from her eyes? Will she suddenly spring away, And soar to her home in the skies? Beatrice! Blessing and blessed to be! Beatrice! Still, as I gaze on thee, Visions of two sweet maids arise, Whose life was of yesterday: Of a Beatrice pale and stern, With the lips of a dumb despair, With the innocent eyes that yearn— Yearn for the young sweet hours of life, Far from sorrow and far from strife, For the happy summers, that never return, When the world seemed good and fair: Of a Beatrice glorious, bright— Of a sainted, ethereal maid, Whose blue eyes are deep fountains of light, Cheering the poet that broodeth apart, Filling with gladness his desolate heart, Like the moon when she shines thro' a cloudless night On a world of silence and shade. And the visions waver and faint, And the visions vanish away That my fancy delighted to paint— She is here at my side, a living child, With the glowing cheek and the tresses wild, Nor death-pale martyr, nor radiant saint, Yet stainless and bright as they. For I think, if a grim wild beast Were to come from his charnel-cave, From his jungle-home in the East— Stealthily creeping with bated breath, Stealthily creeping with eyes of death— He would all forget his dream of the feast, And crouch at her feet a slave. She would twine her hand in his mane: She would prattle in silvery tone, Like the tinkle of summer-rain— Questioning him with her laughing eyes, Questioning him with a glad surprise, Till she caught from those fierce eyes again The love that lit her own. And be sure, if a savage heart, In a mask of human guise, Were to come on her here apart— Bound for a dark and a deadly deed, Hurrying past with pitiless speed— He would suddenly falter and guiltily start At the glance of her pure blue eyes. Nay, be sure, if an angel fair, A bright seraph undefiled, Were to stoop from the trackless air, Fain would she linger in glad amaze— Lovingly linger to ponder and gaze, With a sister's love and a sister's care, On the happy, innocent child. Dec. 4, 1862. STOLEN WATERS The light was faint, and soft the air That breathed around the place; And she was lithe, and tall, and fair, And with a wayward grace Her queenly head she bare. With glowing cheek, with gleaming eye, She met me on the way: My spirit owned the witchery Within her smile that lay: I followed her, I know not why. The trees were thick with many a fruit, The grass with many a flower: My soul was dead, my tongue was mute, In that accursëd hour. And, in my dream, with silvery voice, She said, or seemed to say, “Youth is the season to rejoice—” I could not choose but stay: I could not say her nay. She plucked a branch above her head, With rarest fruitage laden: “Drink of the juice, Sir Knight,” she said: “'Tis good for knight and maiden.” Oh, blind mine eye that would not trace— Oh, deaf mine ear that would not heed— The mocking smile upon her face, The mocking voice of greed! I drank the juice; and straightway felt A fire within my brain: My soul within me seemed to melt In sweet delirious pain. “Sweet is the stolen draught,” she said: “Hath sweetness stint or measure? Pleasant the secret hoard of bread: What bars us from our pleasure?” “Yea, take we pleasure while we may,” I heard myself replying. In the red sunset, far away, My happier life was dying: My heart was sad, my voice was gay. And unawares, I knew not how, I kissed her dainty finger-tips, I kissed her on the lily brow, I kissed her on the false, false lips— That burning kiss, I feel it now! “True love gives true love of the best: Then take,” I cried, “my heart to thee!” The very heart from out my breast I plucked, I gave it willingly: Her very heart she gave to me— Then died the glory from the west. In the gray light I saw her face, And it was withered, old, and gray; The flowers were fading in their place, Were fading with the fading day. Forth from her, like a hunted deer, Through all that ghastly night I fled, And still behind me seemed to hear Her fierce unflagging tread; And scarce drew breath for fear. Yet marked I well how strangely seemed The heart within my breast to sleep: Silent it lay, or so I dreamed, With never a throb or leap. For hers was now my heart, she said, The heart that once had been mine own: And in my breast I bore instead A cold, cold heart of stone. So grew the morning overhead. The sun shot downward through the trees His old familiar flame: All ancient sounds upon the breeze From copse and meadow came But I was not the same. They call me mad: I smile, I weep, Uncaring how or why: Yea, when one's heart is laid asleep, What better than to die? So that the grave be dark and deep. To die! To die? And yet, methinks, I drink of life, to-day, Deep as the thirsty traveller drinks Of fountain by the way: My voice is sad, my heart is gay. When yestereve was on the wane, I heard a clear voice singing So sweetly that, like summer-rain, My happy tears came springing: My human heart returned again. “A rosy child, Sitting and singing, in a garden fair, The joy of hearing, seeing, The simple joy of being— Or twining rosebuds in the golden hair That ripples free and wild. “A sweet pale child— Wearily looking to the purple West— Waiting the great For-ever That suddenly shall sever The cruel chains that hold her from her rest— By earth-joys unbeguiled. “An angel-child— Gazing with living eyes on a dead face: The mortal form foresaken, That none may now awaken, That lieth painless, moveless in her place, As though in death she smiled! “Be as a child— So shalt thou sing for very joy of breath— So shalt thou wait thy dying, In holy transport lying— So pass rejoicing through the gate of death, In garment undefiled.” Then call me what they will, I know That now my soul is glad: If this be madness, better so, Far better to be mad, Weeping or smiling as I go. For if I weep, it is that now I see how deep a loss is mine, And feel how brightly round my brow The coronal might shine, Had I but kept mine early vow: And if I smile, it is that now I see the promise of the years— The garland waiting for my brow, That must be won with tears, With pain—with death—I care not how. May 9, 1862. THE WILLOW-TREE The morn was bright, the steeds were light, The wedding guests were gay: Young Ellen stood within the wood And watched them pass away. She scarcely saw the gallant train: The tear-drop dimmed her e'e: Unheard the maiden did complain Beneath the Willow-Tree. “Oh, Robin, thou didst love me well, Till, on a bitter day, She came, the Lady Isabel, And stole thy heart away. My tears are vain: I live again In days that used to be, When I could meet thy welcome feet Beneath the Willow-Tree. “Oh, Willow gray, I may not stay Till Spring renew thy leaf; But I will hide myself away, And nurse a lonely grief. It shall not dim Life's joy for him: My tears he shall not see: While he is by, I'll come not nigh My weeping Willow-Tree. “But when I die, oh, let me lie Beneath thy loving shade, That he may loiter careless by, Where I am lowly laid. And let the white white marble tell, If he should stoop to see, ‘Here lies a maid that loved thee well, Beneath the Willow-Tree.’” 1859. ONLY A WOMAN'S HAIR [“After the death of Dean Swift, there was found among his papers a small packet containing a single lock of hair and inscribed with the above words.”] “Only a woman's hair!” Fling it aside! A bubble on Life's mighty stream: Heed it not, man, but watch the broadening tide Bright with the western beam. Nay! In those words there rings from other years The echo of a long low cry, Where a proud spirit wrestles with its tears In loneliest agony. And, as I touch that lock, strange visions throng Upon my soul with dreamy grace— Of woman's hair, the theme of poet's song In every time and place. A child's bright tresses, by the breezes kissed To sweet disorder as she flies, Veiling, beneath a cloud of golden mist, Flushed cheek and laughing eyes— Or fringing, like a shadow, raven-black, The glory of a queen-like face— Or from a gipsy's sunny brow tossed back In wild and wanton grace— Or crown-like on the hoary head of Age, Whose tale of life is well-nigh told— Or, last, in dreams I make my pilgrimage To Bethany of old. I see the feast—the purple and the gold; The gathering crowd of Pharisees, Whose scornful eyes are centred to behold Yon woman on her knees. The stifled sob rings strangely on mine ears, Wrung from the depth of sin's despair: And still she bathes the sacred feet with tears, And wipes them with her hair. He scorned not then the simple loving deed Of her, the lowest and the last; Then scorn not thou, but use with earnest heed This relic of the past. The eyes that loved it once no longer wake: So lay it by with reverent care— Touching it tenderly for sorrow's sake— It is a woman's hair. Feb. 17, 1862. THE SAILOR'S WIFE See! There are tears upon her face— Tears newly shed, and scarcely dried: Close, in an agonised embrace, She clasps the infant at her side. Peace dwells in those soft-lidded eyes, Those parted lips that faintly smile— Peace, the foretaste of Paradise, In heart too young for care or guile. No peace that mother's features wear; But quivering lip, and knotted brow, And broken mutterings, all declare The fearful dream that haunts her now, The storm-wind, rushing through the sky, Wails from the depths of cloudy space; Shrill, piercing as the seaman's cry When death and he are face to face. Familiar tones are in the gale: They ring upon her startled ear: And quick and low she pants the tale That tells of agony and fear: “Still that phantom-ship is nigh— With a vexed and life-like motion, All beneath an angry sky, Rocking on an angry ocean. “Round the straining mast and shrouds Throng the spirits of the storm: Darkly seen through driving clouds, Bends each gaunt and ghastly form. “See! The good ship yields at last! Dumbly yields, and fights no more; Driving, in the frantic blast, Headlong on the fatal shore. “Hark! I hear her battered side, With a low and sullen shock, Dashed, amid the foaming tide, Full upon a sunken rock. “His face shines out against the sky, Like a ghost, so cold and white; With a dead despairing eye Gazing through the gathered night. “Is he watching, through the dark, Where a mocking ghostly hand Points a faint and feeble spark Glimmering from the distant land? “Sees he, in this hour of dread, Hearth and home and wife and child? Loved ones who, in summers fled, Clung to him and wept and smiled? “Reeling sinks the fated bark To her tomb beneath the wave: Must he perish in the dark— Not a hand stretched out to save? “See the spirits, how they crowd! Watching death with eyes that burn! Waves rush in ?” she shrieks aloud, Ere her waking sense return. The storm is gone: the skies are clear: Hush'd is that bitter cry of pain: The only sound, that meets her ear, The heaving of the sullen main. Though heaviness endure the night, Yet joy shall come with break of day: She shudders with a strange delight— The fearful dream is pass'd away. She wakes: the gray dawn streaks the dark: With early song the copses ring: Far off she hears the watch-dog bark A joyful bark of welcoming! Feb. 23, 1857. AFTER THREE DAYS [“Written after seeing Holman Hunt's picture, The Finding of Christ in the Temple.”] I stood within the gate Of a great temple, 'mid the living stream Of worshippers that thronged its regal state Fair-pictured in my dream. Jewels and gold were there; And floors of marble lent a crystal sheen To body forth, as in a lower air, The wonders of the scene. Such wild and lavish grace Had whispers in it of a coming doom; As richest flowers lie strown about the face Of her that waits the tomb. The wisest of the land Had gathered there, three solemn trysting-days, For high debate: men stood on either hand To listen and to gaze. The aged brows were bent, Bent to a frown, half thought, and half annoy, That all their stores of subtlest argument Were baffled by a boy. In each averted face I marked but scorn and loathing, till mine eyes Fell upon one that stirred not in his place, Tranced in a dumb surprise. Surely within his mind Strange thoughts are born, until he doubts the lore Of those old men, blind leaders of the blind, Whose kingdom is no more. Surely he sees afar A day of death the stormy future brings; The crimson setting of the herald-star That led the Eastern kings. Thus, as a sunless deep Mirrors the shining heights that crown the bay, So did my soul create anew in sleep The picture seen by day. Gazers came and went— A restless hum of voices marked the spot— In varying shades of critic discontent Prating they knew not what. “Where is the comely limb, The form attuned in every perfect part, The beauty that we should desire in him?” Ah! Fools and slow of heart! Look into those deep eyes, Deep as the grave, and strong with love divine; Those tender, pure, and fathomless mysteries, That seem to pierce through thine. Look into those deep eyes, Stirred to unrest by breath of coming strife, Until a longing in thy soul arise That this indeed were life: That thou couldst find Him there, Bend at His sacred feet thy willing knee, And from thy heart pour out the passionate prayer, “Lord, let me follow Thee!” But see the crowd divide: Mother and sire have found their lost one now: The gentle voice, that fain would seem to chide, Whispers, “Son, why hast thou”— In tone of sad amaze— “Thus dealt with us, that art our dearest thing? Behold, thy sire and I, three weary days, Have sought thee sorrowing.” And I had stayed to hear The loving words, “How is it that ye sought?”— But that the sudden lark, with matins clear, Severed the links of thought. Then over all there fell Shadow and silence; and my dream was fled, As fade the phantoms of a wizard's cell When the dark charm is said. Yet, in the gathering light, I lay with half-shut eyes that would not wake, Lovingly clinging to the skirts of night For that sweet vision's sake. Feb. 16, 1861. FACES IN THE FIRE The night creeps onward, sad and slow: In these red embers' dying glow The forms of Fancy come and go. An island-farm—broad seas of corn Stirred by the wandering breath of morn— The happy spot where I was born. The picture fadeth in its place: Amid the glow I seem to trace The shifting semblance of a face. 'Tis now a little childish form— Red lips for kisses pouted warm— And elf-locks tangled in the storm. 'Tis now a grave and gentle maid, At her own beauty half afraid, Shrinking, and willing to be stayed. Oh, Time was young, and Life was warm, When first I saw that fairy-form, Her dark hair tossing in the storm. And fast and free these pulses played, When last I met that gentle maid— When last her hand in mine was laid. Those locks of jet are turned to gray, And she is strange and far away That might have been mine own to-day— That might have been mine own, my dear, Through many and many a happy year— That might have sat beside me here. Ay, changeless through the changing scene, The ghostly whisper rings between, The dark refrain of “might have been.” The race is o'er I might have run: The deeds are past I might have done; And sere the wreath I might have won. Sunk is the last faint flickering blaze: The vision of departed days Is vanished even as I gaze. The pictures, with their ruddy light, Are changed to dust and ashes white, And I am left alone with night. Jan. 1860. A LESSON IN LATIN Our Latin books, in motley row, Invite us to our task— Gay Horace, stately Cicero: Yet there's one verb, when once we know, No higher skill we ask: This ranks all other lore above— We've learned “‘Amare’ means ‘to love’!” So, hour by hour, from flower to flower, We sip the sweets of Life: Till, all too soon, the clouds arise, And flaming cheeks and flashing eyes Proclaim the dawn of strife: With half a smile and half a sigh, “Amare! Bitter One!” we cry. Last night we owned, with looks forlorn, “Too well the scholar knows There is no rose without a thorn”— But peace is made! We sing, this morn, “No thorn without a rose!” Our Latin lesson is complete: We've learned that Love is Bitter-Sweet! May 1888. PUCK LOST AND FOUND ACROSTIC [“Inscribed in two books ... presented to a little girl and boy, as a sort of memento of a visit paid by them to the author one day, on which occasion he taught them the pastime of folding paper ‘pistols.’”] Puck has fled the haunts of men: Ridicule has made him wary: In the woods, and down the glen, No one meet a Fairy! “Cream!” the greedy Goblin cries— Empties the deserted dairy— Steals the spoons, and off he flies. Still we seek our Fairy! Ah! What form is entering? Lovelit eyes and laughter airy! Is not this a better thing, Child, whose visit thus I sing, Even than a Fairy? Nov. 22, 1891. Puck has ventured back agen: Ridicule no more affrights him In the very haunts of men Newer sport delights him. Capering lightly to and fro, Ever frolicking and funning— “Crack!” the mimic pistols go! Hark! The noise is stunning! All too soon will Childhood gay Realise Life's sober sadness. Let's be merry while we may, Innocent and happy Fay! Elves were made for gladness! Nov. 25, 1891.</field>

A TANGLED TALE [One piecee thing that my have got] One piecee thing that my have got, Maskee that thing my no can do. You talkee you no sabey what? Bamboo. [The elder and the younger knight] The elder and the younger knight They sallied forth at three; How far they went on level ground It matters not to me; What time they reached the foot of hill, When they began to mount, Are problems which I hold to be Of very small account. The moment that each waved his hat Upon the topmost peak— To trivial query such as this No answer will I seek. Yet can I tell the distance well They must have travelled o'er: On hill and plain, 'twixt three and nine, The miles were twenty-four. Four miles an hour their steady pace Along the level track, Three when they climbed—but six when they Came swiftly striding back Adown the hill; and little skill It needs, methinks, to show, Up hill and down together told, Four miles an hour they go. For whether long or short the time Upon the hill they spent, Two thirds were passed in going up, One third in the descent. Two thirds at three, one third at six, If rightly reckoned o'er, Will make one whole at four—the tale Is tangled now no more. NOVELTY AND ROMANCEMENT [“When Desolation snatched her tearful prey] “When Desolation snatched her tearful prey From the lorn empire of despairing day; When all the light, by gemless fancy thrown, Served but to animate the putrid stone; When monarchs, lessening on the wildered sight, Crumblingly vanished into utter night; When murder stalked with thirstier strides abroad, And redly flashed the never-sated sword; In such an hour thy greatness had been seen— That is, if such an hour had ever been— In such an hour thy praises shall be sung, If not by mine, by many a worthier tongue; And thou be gazed upon by wondering men, When such an hour arrives, but not till then!” WILHELM VON SCHMITZ [“What though the world be cross and crooky?] “What though the world be cross and crooky?

We are licensed here to sell to all, Spirits, porter, snuff, and ale!” The LEGEND OF SCOTLAND [Lorenzo dwelt at Heighington] Lorenzo dwelt at Heighington, (Hys cote was made of Dimity,) Least-ways yf not exactly there, Yet yn yts close proximity. Hee called on mee—hee stayed to tee— Yet not a word he ut-tered, Untyl I sayd, “D'ye lyke your bread Dry?” and hee answered “But-tered.” Noodle dumb Has a noodle-head, I hate such noodles, I do. [“Here I bee, and here I byde] “Here I bee, and here I byde, Till such tyme as yt betyde That a Ladye of thys place, Lyke to mee yn name and face, (Though my name bee never known, My initials shall bee shown,) Shall be fotograffed aright— Hedde and Feet bee both yn sight— Then my face shall disappear, Nor agayn affrite you heer.” [“Yn the Auckland Castell cellar] “Yn the Auckland Castell cellar, Long, long ago, I was shut—a brisk young feller— Woe, woe, ah woe! To take her at full-lengthe I never hadde the strengthe Tempore (and soe I tell her) Practerito!” “She was hard—oh, she was cruel— Long, long ago, Starved mee here—not even gruel— No, believe mee, no!— Frae Scotland could I flee, I'd gie my last bawbee,— Arrah, bhoys, fair play's a jhewel, Lave me, darlints, goe!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VII A Miscellany [Five fathom square the Belfry frowns] Five fathom square the Belfry frowns; All its sides of timber made; Painted all in grays and browns; Nothing of it that will fade. Christ Church may admire the change— Oxford thinks it sad and strange. Beauty's dead! Let's ring her knell. Hark! now I hear them—ding-dong, bell. THE WANDERING BURGESS Our Willie had been sae lang awa' Frae bonnie Oxford toon, The townsfolk they were greeting a' As they went up and doon. He hadna been gane a year, a year, A year but barely ten, When word came unto Oxford toon, Our Willie wad come agen. Willie he stude at Thomas his Gate, And made a lustie din; And who so blithe as the gate-porter To rise and let him in? “Now enter Willie, now enter Willie, And look around the place, And see the pain that we have ta'en Thomas his Quad to grace.” The first look that our Willie cast, He leuch loud laughters three, The neist look that our Willie cast The tear blindit his e'e. Sae square and stark the Tea-chest frowned Athwart the upper air, But when the Trench our Willie saw, He thocht the Tea-chest fair. Sae murderous-deep the Trench did gape The parapet aboon, But when the Tunnel Willie saw He loved the Trench eftsoon. 'Twas mirk beneath the tane archway, 'Twas mirk beneath the tither; Ye wadna ken a man therein, Though it were your ain dear brither. He turned him round and round about, And looked upon the Three; And dismal grew his countenance, And drumlie grew his e'e. “What cheer, what cheer, my gallant knight?” The gate-porter 'gan say. “Saw ever ye sae fair a sight As ye have seen this day?” “Now hand your tongue of your prating, man: Of your prating now let me be. For, as I'm a true knight, a fouler sight I'll never live to see. “Before I'd be the ruffian dark Who planned this ghastly show, I'd serve as secretary's clerk To Ayrton or to Lowe. “Before I'd own the loathly thing That Christ Church Quad reveals, I'd serve as shoeblack's underling To Odger and to Beales!” A BACCHANALIAN ODE Here's to the Freshman of bashful eighteen! Here's to the Senior of twenty! Here's to the youth whose moustache can't be seen! And here's to the man who has plenty! Let the men Pass! Out of the mass I'll warrant we'll find you some fit for a Class! Here's to the Censors, who symbolize Sense, Just as Mitres incorporate Might, Sir! To the Bursar, who never expands the expense! And the Readers, who always do right, Sir! Tutor and Don, Let them jog on! I warrant they'll rival the centuries gone! Here's to the Chapter, melodious crew! Whose harmony surely intends well: For, though it commences with “harm,” it is true, Yet its motto is “All's well that ends well!” 'Tis love, I'll be bound, That makes it go round! For “In for a penny is in for a pound!” Here's to the Governing Body, whose Art (For they're Masters of Arts to a man, Sir!) Seeks to beautify Christ Church in every part, Though the method seems hardly to answer! With three T's it is graced— Which letters are placed To stand for the names of Tact, Talent, and Taste! [‘Alas! she would not hear my prayer!] ‘Alas! she would not hear my prayer! Yet it were rash to tear my hair; Disfigured, I should be less fair. ‘She was unwise, I may say blind; Once she was lovingly inclined; Some circumstance has changed her mind.’ [‘Well! so my offer was no go!] ‘Well! so my offer was no go! She might do worse, I told her so; She was a fool to answer “No.” ‘However, things are as they stood; Nor would I have her if I could, For there are plenty more as good.’ [‘Firebrands and daggers! hope hath fled!] ‘Firebrands and daggers! hope hath fled! To atoms dash the doubly dead! My brain is fire—my heart is lead! ‘Her soul is flint, and what am I? Scorch'd by her fierce, relentless eye, Nothingness is my destiny!’</field>
