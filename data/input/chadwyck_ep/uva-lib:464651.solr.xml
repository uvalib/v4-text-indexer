      <field name="fulltext">[The First Book] [Ayres for one or two voyces to the Theorbo Lute, or Basse-Viol] A Lovers Melancholy Repose. Like Hermit poor in pensive place obscure, I mean to spend my days of endless doubt, To wail such woes as time cannot recure, Where none but love shal ever find me out. And at my gates, and at my gates despair shal linger stil, To let in death, to let in death when love and fortune wil. A Gowne of gray my body shall attire, My staffe of broken hope whereon I'le stay, Of late repentance linkt with long desire, The Couch is fram'd whereon my limbs I lay, And at my gates, &amp;c. My food shall be of care and sorrow made, My drink nought else but tears faln from mine eyes, And for my light in this obscure shade, The flame may serve, which from my heart arise, And at my gates, Loves ingratitude. Take, O take those lips away, That so sweetly were forsworn, &amp; those eys that break of days, Light that do mislead the morn; But my kisses bring again Seals of love though seals in vain. Hide, O hide those Hils of Snow That thy frozen Blossome bears; On whose tops the Pinks that grow, Are yet of those that April wears: But first set my poor heart free, Bound in those Icy Chaines by thee. Cupid's weak Artillery. Come Lovers all to me, and cease your mourning: Love hath no shafts to shoot, no more brands burning: He means my pains shal you from pains deliver, For in my brest h'as emptied all his Quiver. Had he not been a childe he would have known, H'as lost a thousand servants to kill one. Love preferring Virtue above Wealth. She that loves me for my self, For affection, not base pelf, Ne'r regarding my descent, Gesture, feature, but intent, She, only she, deserves to be belov'd of me. She that loves me for no end, But because I am her friend; Never doubting my desire, But believ'd it sacred fire: She, only she, deserves to be belov'd of me. She that loves me with resolve Ne're to alter till dissolve; Slighting all things, that stern fate May hereafter seem to threat: She, only she, deserves to be belov'd of me. A strife betwixt two Cupids reconciled. About the sweet Bag of a Bee, two Cupids fell at ods; And whose the pretty prize should be, they vow'd to ask the gods: Which Venus hearing thither came, and for their boldness stript them, And taking thence from each his flame, with rods of Mirtle whipt them: Which done, to still their wanton cryes, and quiet grown sh'ad seen them, She kist and dry'd their dove-like eyes, and gave the Bag between them. Venus lamenting her lost Adonis. Wake my Adonis Wake my Adonis, do not die, one life's enough for thee and I; where are thy looks, thy wiles thy fears, thy frowns, thy smiles? alas, in vain I call, one death hath snatcht them all; yet death's not deadly in that face death in those looks it self hath grace; 'twas this, 'twas this I fear'd, when thy pale ghost appear'd, this I presag'd, when thundering Jove tore the best Mirtle in my grove, when my sick rose buds lost their smel, &amp; from my temples untoucht fell, and 'twas for some such thing, my Dove first hung her wing. Whither art thou my Deity gone? Venus in Venus there is none: in vain a godess now am I, only to grieve and not to die: but I wil love my grief, make tears my tears relief, and sorrow shall to me a new Adonis be: And this the fates shan't rob me of whilst I a godess am to grieve and not to die. To his Love Answering No. Stay, stay, O stay, that heart, I vow 'tis mine, Ravish'd from hence by her whose parts divine; Words cannot fully speak, now seeks her cure, Whose only No, sent from her lips most pure, Makes it thus range from me, woe's me that No, Lost me that heart, and fills its place with wo. O hold it fast, I come yet let it fly, I cannot move, 'tis pity both should dy; Perhaps she may relent, and with one yea Give us a second life, treble our bliss; If not, farewell my heart, I've pleas'd mine eyes, Since thou art lost, sees thee her sacrifice. On his Loves Absence. Bring back my comfort and return, For well thou know'st that I In such a vigorous passion burn, That missing thee I dye: Return, return, insult no more, Return, return, and me restore To those sequestred joys I had before. Absence in most, that quenches love, And cooles their warm desire; The ardor of my heat improves, And makes the flame aspire: The maxim therefore I deny, And term it though a tyranny, The Nurse to Faith, to Love, to Constancy. Beauty clouded with grief. Why dearest should you weep, when I relate The story of my woe? Let not the swarthy mist of my black fate O'recast thy beauty so: For each rich pearl lost on that score Adds to mischance and wounds, your servant more. Quench not those stars that to Dy bliss should guide; O stay that precious teare! Nor let those drops upon my deluge tyde To drown thy beauty there, That cloud of sorrow makes it night, You lose your Luster, but the World its Light. On Loves Artillery. No more blind Boy No more blind Boy, for see my heart is made thy quiver, where remains no voyd place for another dart; and alas that conquest gains small prayse, that only brings away a tame and unresisting prey: behold a noble Foe all arm'd, desires thy weak Artillery, that hath thy bow and quiver charm'd, a Rebell Beauty conqu'ring thee; if thou dar'st equall combate try, wound her, for 'tis for her I dye. On the Vicissitudes of Love. He that will not love, must be my Scholar He that will not love, must be my Scholar, and learn this of me, there be in love as many fears as the Summer corn hath ears; sighs, and sobs, and troubles more than the sand that makes the shoar: Now an Ague, then a Feaver, both tormenting Lovers ever. Wouldst thou know besides all these, how hard a Woman 'tis to please? how high she's priz'd whose worth's but small? little thou'lt love, or nought at all. A false designe to be cruel. [I] In vain fair Chloris, you designe, To be cruel, to be kind; For we know with all your arts, You never hold but willing hearts; Men are too wise grown to expire With broken shafts, and painted fire. II And if among a thousand Swains Some one of Love, or Fate complains; And all the stars in heav'n defie, With Cloro's lip, or Celia's eye: 'Tis not their love the Youth would chuse, But the glory to refuse. III Then wisely make your prize of those Want wit, or courage to oppose; But tempt me not that can discover What will redeem the fondest Lover: And flie the list, lest it appear Your pow'r is measur'd by our fear. IV So the rude wave securely shocks The yeelding Bark, but the stiff rocks If it attempt, how soon again Broke and dissolv'd it fills the Main: It foams and roars, but we deride Alike its weakness, and its pride. Constancy in Love. [1] Tis not ith' pow'r of all thy scorn Or unrelenting hate, To quench my flames, or make them burn With heat more temperate: Still do I struggle with despair, And ever court disdain; And though you ne'r prove lesse severe, Ile dote upon my pain. 2 Yet meaner beauties cannot claime In Love this tyranny, They must pretend an equall flame, Or else our passions die: You faire Clarinda you alone Are priz'd at such a rate, To have a Votary of one Whom you do reprobate. On Inconstancy. [I] Mistake me not, I am as cold as hot: Although my tongue betray my heart ore'night, Ere morn, I'm alter'd quite. II Sometime I burn, and straight to Ice I turn, Ther's nothing so unconstant as my mind, I change with every wind. III Perhaps in jest, I said I lov'd thee best, But 'twas no more, then what not long before I vow'd to twenty more. IV Then prethee see, thou giv'st no heed to me; For when I cannot keep my word a day, What hope hadst thou to stay. On Womens Inconstancy. Catch me a Star that's falling from the Skie, Cause an Immortall creature for to die; Stop with thy hand the Current of the Seas, Peirce the earths Center to th'Antipodies; Cause Time return, and call back Yesterday, Cloath January like the moneth of May; Weigh me an ounce of Flame, Blow back the wind; Then hast thou found Faith in a Womans mind. A Resolution not to Love. [I] Love I must tell thee, Ile no longer be A Victive to thy beardless Deitie; Nor shall this heart of mine, now 'tis return'd, Be offer'd at thy shrine, or at thy Altar burn'd. Love like Religions made an Ayrie name, To awe those souls whom want of wit makes tame. II Ther's no such thing as Quiver, Shaft, or Bow, Nor do's Love wound, but we Imagine so: Or if it do's perplex and grieve the mind, 'Tis the poor masculine sect: women no sorrow find. 'Tis not our parts or person that can move 'um, Nor is't mens worth, but wealth, makes women love 'um. III Reason henceforth, not Love, shall be my guide, Our fellow Creatures shan't be deifide: Ile now a Rebell be, and so pull down That distaffe Hierarchy and females fanci'd crown. In these unbridled times who will not strive To free his neck from all prerogative. A Forsaken Lovers Complaint. [I] As I walk'd forth one Summers day, To view the Medows green and gay, A pleasant Bower I espide Standing fast by a river side; And in't a Maiden I heard cry, Alas! Alas! ther's none e're lov'd as I. II Then round the medow did she walk, Catching each flower by the stalk; Such flowers as in the medow grew, The Dead-mans Thumb, an Hearb all blew. And as she pull'd them, still cry'd she, Alas! Alas! none e're lov'd like me. III The Flowers of the sweetest sents She bound about with knotty Bents, And as she bound them up in Bands She wept, she sight'd and wrung her hands, Alas! Alas! Alas! cry'd she, Alas! none was e're lov'd like me. IV When she had fill'd her Apron full Of such green things as she could cull, The green leaves serv'd her for a Bed The Flowers were the Pillow for her head: Then down she laid, ne'r more did speak; Alas! Alas! with Love her heart did break. At a Masque, to invite the Ladies to Dance. [I] Come come noble Nymphs &amp; do not hide The joys for which you so provide; If not to mingle with us men, What make you here? go home agen. Your dressings do confess By what we see, so curious parts of Pallas, and Aracknes Arts, That you could mean no less. II Why do you were the Silk-worms toyls? Or glory in the Shel-fish spoils? Or strive to shew the grains of Ore That you have gathered long before? Whereof to make a Stock To graff the greener Emrauld on, Or any better water'd Srone, Or Ruby of the Rock. III Why do you smell of Amber-greece, Whereof was formed Neptunes Neece, The Queen of Love? unlesse you can Like Sea-born-Venus, love a man? Try, put your selves unto't: Your Looks, and Smiles, and Thoughts that meet; Ambrosian-hands, and Silver-feet, Do promise you will do't. Loves Scrutiny. [I] Why shouldst thou swear I am forsworn, Since thine I vow'd to be? Lady it is already morn, It was last night I swore to thee, This fond impossibilitie. II Have I not lov'd thee much and long, A tedious twelve houres space? I should all other Beauties wrong, And rob thee of a new imbrace, Should I still dote upon thy face. III Not that all Joyes in thy brown hair By others may be found: But I will search the black, the fair, Like skilfull Mineralists that sound For treasuers in unplowed ground. IV Then if when I have lov'd thee round, Thou prove the pleasant she, In spoyle of meaner Beauties crown'd, I laden will return to thee, Ev'n sated with varietie. No Beauty without Love. [I] Thou art not fayre for all thy red and white, For all those Rosie ornaments in thee. Thou art not sweet nor made of meer delight, Nor fair, nor sweet unless thou pity mee. I will not, smooth thy fancy, thou shalt prove That Beauty is no Beauty without Love. II Yet love not me, nor seek thou to allure My thoughts with beauty, were it now divine; Thy smiles and kisses I cannot indure, I'le not be wrapt up in those armes of thine. Now shew if thou be a woman right, Imbrace, and kisse, and love me in dispite. Delayes in Love breeds Danger. [I] Phillis, why should we delay, Pleasures shorter than the day? Could we, which we never can, Stretch our lives beyond three span, Beauty like a Shadow flyes, And our Youth before us dyes. II Or would Youth and Beauty stay, Love ha's wings, and will away; Love ha's swifter wings than time, Change in love too oft do's chime; Gods that never change their state, Very oft their love and hate. III Phillis, to this truth we owe All the love betwixt us now; Let not you and I require What ha's been our past desire; On what Shepherds you have smil'd, Or what Nymphs I have beguil'd. Leave it to the Planets two, What we shall hereafter do, For the joy we now may prove, Take advice of present love. On CÃ¦lia's Coynesse. [I] If the quick spirit of your Eye now languish, and anon must dye; If every sweet and every grace must flye from that forsaken face: Then CÃ¦lia let us reap our joys, E're time such goodly fruit destroys. II Or if that Golden Fleece must grow, for ever free from aged Snow; If those bright Suns must know no shade, nor your fresh Beauty ever fade; Then CÃ¦lia feare not to bestow, What still being gather'd, still must grow. Thus either Time his sickle brings In vain, or else in vain his wings. Loves sweet Repose. Amidst the Mirtles as I walk, Love and my Sighs thus enter talk; Tell me said I, in deep distress, Where I may find my Shepherdess. Then Fool (said Love) know'st thou not this, In every thing that's good she is, In yonder Tulip go and seek, There thou shalt find her Lip and Cheek. 'Tis true, said I, and thereupon, And went and pluckt them one by one To make a part a union, But on a suddain all was gone. In that inamell'd Fancy by There shalt thou find her curious Eye; In bloom of Peach, in Roses bud There wave the streams of her bloud. At which I stopt; said Love, these bee Fond man, resemblances of thee; For as these Flowers thy joy must dye, Even in the turning of an eye. And all thy hopes of her must wither, As do those Flowers when knit together. A Willow Garland sent for a Newyeers-gift. [I] A Willow Garland thou didst send Last day perfum'd to mee, Which did but onely this portend, I was forsook of thee. II Since that it is, I'le tell the what, To morrow thou shalt see Me wear the Willow, after that To dye upon the tree. III As Beasts unto the Alter go With Garlands, so I Will with my Willow wreath also Come forth, and sweetly die. Loves Victory. [I] Victorious Beauty! though your Eyes Are able to subdue an hoast, And therefore are unlike to boast The taking of a little prize, Do not a single heart despise. II I came alone, but yet so arm'd With former love I durst have sworn That as that privy coat was worn, With characters of beauty charm'd, Thereby I might have scap'd unharm'd. III The Conquest in regard of me, Alas is small! but in respect Of her that did my Love protect, Where it divulg'd, deserv'd to be Recorded for a Victorie. IV But neither steel nor stony brasse Are proofs against those looks of thine, Nor can a beauty lesse divine, By any heart be long possest, Where you intend an interest. V And such a one as chance to view Her lovely face, perhaps may stay, Though you have stole my heart away; If all your servants prove not true, May steal a heart or two from you. Diswasion from Presumption. Ladies, you that seem so nice, And as cold in shew as Ice, And perhaps have held out thrice, Do not think but in a trice One or other may entice, And at last by some device Set your honours at a price. You whose smooth and dainty skin, Rosie lips, or cheeks, or chin, All that gaze upon you win; Yet insult not, sparks within, Slowly burn ere flames begin, And presumption still hath bin Held a most notorious sin. The Careless Lovers Resolution. Let longing Lovers sit and pine, And the forsaken Willow wear, Love shal not blast this heart of mine, With ling'ring hope or killing fear: Ile never love till I enjoy, Or lose my time on her that's coy. If Ladies call us to the field, And all their Colours there display, Alasse! they needs must to us yield, Since we are better arm'd than they; 'Tis folly then to beg or whine For us that are born Masculine. Then Lovers learn your strength to know, And you may overcome with ease, Your enemy fights with a Bow That cannot wound, unlesse you please; And he that pines because shee's coy, Wants wit, or courage, women say. Disdain. [I] Take heed fair Chloris, how you tame (With your disdain) Amintor's flame. A noble heart, when once despis'd, Awels unto such a height of pride, 'Twil rather burst than deign to be A worshipper of crueltie. II You may use common shepherds so, My flames at last to storms will grow, And blow such scorn upon thy pride, Will blast all I have magnifi'd: You are not fair when Love you lack, Ingratitude makes all things black. III O do not for a flock of sheep, A golden showre when as you sleep; Or for the tales ambition tells, Forsake the house where honor dwels. In Damons palace you'l ne'r shine So bright as in these armes of mine. Loves Fruition. Tell me not I my time mispend, 'Tis time lost to reprove me: Enjoy thou thine, I have my End, So Chloris onely love me. Tell me not others flocks are full, Mine poor, let them despise me That more abound with Milk, and Wool, So Chloris only prize me. Try other easier eares with these Unappertaining Stories; He never feels the Worlds disease, That cares not for her Glories. For pity thou that wiser art, Whose thoughts lies wide of mine; Let me alone with my one heart, And I'le ne'r envy thine. Nor blame whoever blames my wit, That seek's no higher prize Then in unenvy'd Shades to sit, And sing of Chloris Eyes. Loves Drollery. I love thee for thy Fickleness, And great Inconstancy; For had'st thou been a constant Lass, Then thou had'st ne'r lov'd mee. I love thee for thy Wantonesse, And for thy Drollerie; For if thou had'st not lov'd to sport, Then thou had'st ne're lov'd mee. I love thee for thy Uglynesse, And for thy foolerie; For if thou had'st been fair or wise, Then thou had'st ne'r lov'd mee. I love thee for thy poverty, And for thy want of Coyne; For if thou hadst beem worth a Groat, Then thou had'st ne'r been mine. Then let me have thy heart a while, And thou shalt have my mony; Ile part with all the wealth I have, T'enjoy a Lass so Bonny. Disdain returned. [I] He that loves a Rosie cheek, Or a Corall lip admires; Or from Star-like eyes doth seek Fuel to maintain his fires, As old Time makes these decay, So his flames must waste away. II But a smooth and stedfast mind, Gentle thoughts, and calm desires, Hearts with equall love combin'd, Kindle never-dying fires: Where these are not, I despise Lovely Cheeks, or Lips or Eyes. III CÃ¦lia, now no tears can win My resolv'd heart to return; I have search'd thy soul within, And find nought but pride and scorn: I have learn'd those Arts, and now Can disdain as much as thou. Some God in my revenge convey That Love to her I cast away. Loves Content. Dear, leave thy home, and come with mee, That scorn the world for love of thee: Here we will live within this Park, A Court of joy and pleasures Ark. To his Forsaken Mistresse. [I] I do confess th'art smooth and fair, And I might ha' gon neer to love thee, Had I not found the sleightest pray'r That lip could move, had pow'r to move thee. But I can let thee now alone, As worthy to be lov'd by none. II I do confess th'art sweet, yet find Thee such an Unthrift of thy Sweets; Thy favours are but like the wind, Which kisseth ev'ry thing it meets: And since thou canst with more than one, Th'art worthy to be kiss'd by none. III The morning Rose that untoutch'd stands, Arm'd with her briars, how sweet shee smels! But pluck'd, and strain'd through ruder hands, Her sweets no longer with her dwels; But Sent and Beauty both are gone, And Leaves fall from her one by one. IV Such Fate e're long will thee betide, When thou hast handled been a while, With sear Flow'rs to be thrown aside; And I shall sigh when some will smile, To see thy love to ev'ry one Hath brought thee to be lov'd by none. To a Lady singing. While I listen to thy voice, Chloris While I listen to thy voice, Chloris, I feel my life decay, that pow'rfull noise calls my fleeting soul away; O suppress that magick sound, which destroyes without a wound! Peace, peace, Chloris, peace, or singing dye, that together thou and I to heav'n may go; for all we know of what the blessed do above, is that they sing, and that they love. On a Bleeding Lover. [I] A lover once I did espy, With bleeding heart and weeping eye; He wept and cry'd, How great's his pain, That lives in love, and loves in vain. II Can there (says he) no cure be found, But by the hand that gave the wound? Then let me dye, which I'le indure, Since she wants charity to cure. III Yet let her one day feel the pain, To wish she had cur'd, and wish in vain; For wither'd cheeks may chance recover Some sparks of love, but not a Lover. Two Songs in the Play of The Royal Slave. Come from the Dungeon to the Throne Come from the Dungeon to the Throne, to be a King, and straight be none: Reign then a while, that thou mayst be fitter to fall by majestie: So Beasts for sacrifice we feed, first they are crown'd, and then they bleed, they bleed. Love and Musick. Come my Sweet, whilest ev'ry Strain cals our Souls into the Ear Come my Sweet, whilest ev'ry Strain cals our Souls into the Ear, where the greedy listning fain would turn into the sound they hear; lest in desire to fill the quire, themselves they tie to harmony, let's kiss and call them back again. A Resolution in choice of a Mistresse. [I] Wert thou yet fairer then thou art, Which lies not in the pow'r of Art; Or had'st thou in thine Eyes more Darts, Then Cupids ever shot at Hearts; Yet if they were not thrown at me, I would not cast a Thought at thee. II I'de rather marry a disease, Then court the thing I cannot please: She that would cherish my desires Must court my flames with equall fires: What pleasure is there in a Kiss To him that doubts the Heart's not his? III I love thee not 'cause thou art fair, Softer than down, smoother than air; Not for the Cupids that do lye In either corner of thine Eye: Would you then know what it might be? 'Tis I love you 'cause you love me. Inconstancy in Love. [I] To love thee without Flattery were a Sin, Since thou art all Inconstancy within; Thy Heart is govern'd onely by thine Eyes, The Newest object is thy Richest prize: Love mee then just as I love thee, That's till a fairer I can see. II My thoughts are now at liberty, and can Love all that's fair, as you can all that's man; I never will hereafter think it strange To see thee please thy Appetite with change: No! love me just as I love thee, That's till a fairer I can see. III I hate this constant doting on a Face, Content ne're dwelt a Week in any place; Why then should you and I love one another Longer then we can be content together? Love mee then just as I love thee, That's till a fairer I can see. Discontent. I prethee turn that Face away, Whose splendor but benights the day; Sad Eyes like mine, and wounded Hearts, Shun the bright rayes which Beauty darts; Unwelcome is the Sun that pries Into those Shades where sorrow lies: Go shine on happy things, to me, That blessing is a miserie; Whom thy fierce Sun not warms but burns, Like that the Sooty Indian turns; I'le serve the night, and there confin'd; Wish thee less fair or else more kind. Loves Votary. Bid me but live, and I will live, thy Votary to be; or bid me love, and I will give a loving heart to thee. A heart as soft, a heart as kind, a heart as soundly free As in the world thou canst not find, that heart I'le give to thee. Bid me to weep, and I will weep, while I have eyes to see, Or having none, yet I will keep a heart to weep for thee. Bid that heart stay, and it shall stay, and honour thy decree, Or bid it languish quite away and it shall do't for thee. Thou art my love, my life my heart, the very eye of mee, And hast command of every part, to live and dye for thee. To Aurelia. Bright Aurelia, I do owe All the woe I can know To those glorious looks alone, Though you are unrelenting stone; The quick lightning from your eyes, Did sacrifice, My unwise, my unwary harmless heart, And now you glory in my smart. How unjustly you do blame That pure flame, From you came. Vext with what your selfe may burn, Your scorns to tinder did it turn. The least sparke now Love can call That does fall On the small Scorcht remainder of my heart, Will make it burn in every part. Loves Flattery. Ladies fly from loves smooth tale, Oaths steept in tears do oft prevail, Grief is infectious, and the air Inflam'd with sighs wil blast the fair; Then stop your ears when Lovers cry, Lest yourselves weep, when no lost eye Shall with a sorrowing tear repay That pity which you cast away. To Chloris. [I] Come Cloris leave thy wandring sheep, Thou shalt more amorous creatures keep; And be the only envi'd Dame That moves upon this grassie frame: For thou shalt Herds of Cupids have, And Love and I will be thy slave. II Nymphs, Satyres, and the Sylvian Fawns, Shall leave the Woods and narrow Lawns To wait on Cloris, and adore Their Cytherea; now no more The name of Cloris shall create A servitude in every state. III In yonder Mirtle grove wee'l dwell With more content then tongue can tell, Where hungry Moles shall not afright Thy tender Lambs or thee by night: There we the wanton theeves will play, And steal each others hearts away. Seeming Coyness. [I] Ambitious Love, farwel; You are to troublesome a Guest To affect what doth excell; And to be ever at a Feast; Is not the cheapest freest diet, Less in joy and less in quiet: Be proud who list Fetters of Gold to wear, I like no tedious ceremonious cheer. II I'le take such as I find, So it be good, and handsome drest, Pretty, looking freely, kinde, To a good appetite is best. If your Usage do not please you, Change is near you Change will ease you: Tempest and Feasts the wisest disaffect, Let it suffice you find no disrespect. III Seek not the highest place, The lowest commonly is most free Less subject to disgrace, Others eyes, or your jealousies. Bold Freedome will improve your taste, When awe imbitters a repast: A doating fancy is a foolish Guest, The freest welcome makes the sweetest Feast. IV It is not Natures way, She made Love no such busie thing, She meant it a short lay, A Common-Weal without a King. Her love on ev'ry edge doth grow, Her Fruits are best in Taste and Shew; Her Sweets extend unto the meanest Clown, Often most fair, though in a Russet Gown. Loves Bachinall. Lay that sullen Garland by thee, Keep it for th'Elizium shades; Take my wreath of lusty Ivy, Not of that faint Mirtle made; When I see thy soul descending To that cold unfertile Plain Of sad fools the Lake attending, Thou shalt wear this Crown again. Now drink wine, and know the ods 'Twixt that Lethe, 'twixt that Lethe, 'Twixt that Lethe, and the Gods. Rouse thy dull and drowsie spirits, Here's the soul reviving streams, The stupid Lovers brain inherits Nought but vain and empty dreams. Think not thou these dismall trances, Which our raptures can content, The Lad that laughs, sings and dances, Shall come soonest to his end. Cho. Sadnesse may some pity move, Mirth and courage, mirth and courage, Mirth and courage conquers love. Fy then on that cloudy fore-head, Ope thou vainly crossed armes; Thou mayst as well call back the buried As raise Love by such like charmes. Sacrifice a glasse of Clarret To each letter of her name; Gods have oft descended for it, Mortals must do more the same. If she comes not at that flood, Sleep will come sleep will come, Sleep will come and that's as good. Platonick Love. [I] Change Platonicks, change for shame, Get your selves another name. This is but a thin disguise, And betray'd to common eyes: Dim and purblind though they bee, Your Philosophy they see Is but Lay Hypocrisie, And a kind of Heresie. II Plato ne'r allow'd a Kiss, Nor the like fantastick bliss, All the day sit and Ca Goll With Sir Amorous La Fool; Ne'r dreamt of that delight Which a Ball presents at night, To apt you to what follows next, Only you corrupt the Text. III Yet must Plato justifie All your wanton vanitie, When indeed the truth to say, 'Tis Opinion that doth sway. Is a meer Court-Frippery, You act but yet most formerly What your Sex was wont to do Many hundred years ago. Love Neglected. Little love serves my turn, 'tis so enflaming, Rather then I will burn I will leave gaming; For when I think upon't, O! 'tis so painful, 'Cause Ladies have a trick, to be disdainfull. Beauty shall court it selfe, 'tis not worth speaking, Ile no more Amorous pangs, no more heart-breaking: Those that ne'r felt the smart, let them go try it, I have redeem'd my heart now I defie it, No more, no more, I must give o're; for Beauty is so sweet, It makes me pine, distracts my mind, and surfeit when I see't. Forgive me Love, if I remove into some other sphear, Where I may keep a flock of sheep, and know no other care. Lovers Wantonnesse. [I] See, see, how carless men are grown Of Love and Loving in our days, Every ones Heart is now his owne; His Eyes upon no object stays, But baits a while and goes his ways. II Shall Beauty that was wont to reign Un-rivall'd in each noble breast, Command by turns, or else in vain; And by new fashion'd minds deprest, Become an Inn, and love a Guest. III Sure they suppose her of Glasse, And let her first on purpose fall, Then peice-meal would pick up this Masse, That for one Beauty bow to all, And change of Fetters, Freedome call. IV Though lowly minded, I will stand With such for place, and at no rate Give Rebell Lovers th'upper hand, That every day new Lords create; I serve a Monarch, they a State. Venus to her Adonis. Come Adonis, come away Come Adonis, come away, what distaste could drive the hence, where so much delight doth reign, sotting ev'n the soul of Sense? and though thou unkind hast prov'd, never Youth was so belov'd: Then lov'd Adonis, come away, for Venus brooks, for Venus brooks not this delay, for Venus brooks not this delay. Loves Flattery. I can love for an hour when I'm at leasure, He that loves half a day fools without measure: Cupid then tell me what art had thy mother, To make men love one face more than another? Some to be thought more wise daily endevour To make the World believe they can live for ever: Ladies believe them not, they'l but deceive you, For when they have their ends then they will leave you. Men cannot tyre themselves on your sweet features, They'l have variety of loving Creatures. Too much of any thing sets them a cooling, Though they can never do't, yet they'l be fooling. Inconstancie in Women. [I] I am confirm'd a woman can, Love this, or that, or any man; This day her love is melting hot, Tomorrow swears she knows you not; Let her but an new object find, And she is of another mind: Then hang me Ladies at your dore, If e're I dote upon you more. II Yet still I'le love the fair one, why? For nothing but to please mine eye; And so the fat and soft skinn'd Dame I'le flatter, to appease my flame; For her that's Musicall I long, When I am sad to sing a Song: But hang me Ladies, &amp;c. III I'le give my fancy leave to range Through every face to find out change: The black, the brown, the fair shall be But objects of varietie: I'le court you all to serve my turn, But with such flames as shall not burn: For hang me Ladies, &amp;c. A Lovers Legacy. Fain would I Chloris e're I die Bequeath you such a Legacie, As you might say when I am gon, None has the like! My heart alone Were the best gift I could bestow, But that's already yours you know: So that till you my Heart resigne, Or fill with yours the place of mine; And by that grace my store renew, I shall have nought worth giving you, Whose Brest has all the wealth I have, Save a faint Carcase, and a Grave: But had I as many Hearts as Hairs, As many Loves as Love has Fears, As many Lives as Years have Hours, They should be all and only yours. Loves Martyr. [I] How long shall I a Martyr be To Love and Womans cruelty? Or why doth sullen Fate confine My heart to one that is not mine: Had I er'e lov'd as others do, But only for an hour or two, Then there had store of reason bin Why I should suffer for my sin. II But Love, thou knowest with what a flame I have ador'd my Mistress name: How I ne'r offered other fires But such as rose from chaste desires: Nor have I ere prophaned thy shrine With an inconstant fickle minde; Yet thou combining with my Fate, Hath forc'd my love and her to hate. III O Love! if her supremacie Have not a greater power then thee, For pity sake then once be kind, And throw a dart to change her mind: Thy deity we shall suspect, If our reward must be neglect. Then make her love, or let me be Inspir'd with scorn as well as she. Amintor for his Chloris absence. [I] Tell me you wandering spirits of the Air, Did you not see a Nymph more bright, more fair Than Beauties darling, or of parts more sweet Than stolne content? If such a one you meet, Wait on her hourly where so e're she flies, And cry, and cry, Amintor for her absence dies. II Go search the Vallies, pluck up every Rose, You'l find a sent, a blush of her in those: Fish, fish for Pearle, or Corall, there you'l see How orientall all her colours bee. Go call the Ecchoes to your aide, and cry, Chloris, Chloris, for that's her name for whom I dy. III But stay a while, I have inform'd you ill, Were shee on earth she had been with me still: Go fly to Heaven, examine every Sphere, And try what Star hath lately lighted there; If any brighter than the Sun you see, Fall down, fall down, and worship it, for that is shee. Love in a Calme. [I] How cool and temperate I am grown, Since I could call my heart my own? Beauty and I now calmly play, Whilst others burn and melt away: Not all those wanton hours I have spent, Can rob me of this new content. II Loves mists are scattered from my sight, Which flattered me with new delight, And now I see 'tis but a face That stole my heart out of its place: Then Love forgive me, I'le no more Thine Altars or thy Shrine adore. III Farewell to all heart-breaking eyes, Farewell each look that can surprize, Farewell those curls and amorous spels, Farewell each place where Cupid dwels; And farewell each bewitching smile, I must enjoy my selfe a while. Loves Shepherdesse. In faith I cannot keep my Sheep In faith I cannot keep my Sheep, since first I grew to be in love: whilst my poor Flock a wandring creep, and I to Fate a Shepherd am; Love, first in love, in love, I first began. Love without Additionals. [I] Of the kind boy I ask no red and white To make up my delight, No odd becoming graces, Black eyes, or little know not what's in Faces; Make me but mad enough, give me good store Of Love, for her I court, I ask no more; 'Tis Love in Love that makes the sport. II There's no such thing as that, we Beauty call, It is meer couzenage all; For though some long ago Lik't certain colours mingled so and so, That doth not tie me now from chusing new, If I a fancy take To black and blew, That fancy doth it Beauty make. II 'Tis not the meat, but 'tis the appetite Makes eating a delight; And if I like one dish More than another, that a Phesant is: What in our Matches, may in us be found, So to the height, and nick We up be bound, No matter by what hand or trick. A Frozen Heart made warm by Love. Go, go, and bestride the Southern wind Go, go, and bestride the Southern wind, fly, O forlorn! nor look behind, till thou the glazed Ocean hast past and Climes unknown to man, laid on a snow-rais'd mountain, bear the bosome to the freezing air; and if those colds be not so great to quench, but they thaw with thy heat her far more cold disdain, apply thine own despair and will to dye; and when by these congeal'd to stone, then will her heart and thine be one. False Love reproved. [I] By all thy Glories willingly I go, Yet could have wish'd thee constant in thy love; But since thou needs must prove Uncertain as is thy Beauty, Or as the Glass that shews it thee, My hopes thus soon to overthrow, Shows thee more fickle; but my flames by this Are easier quencht than his, Whom flattering smiles betray; 'Tis tyrannous delay Breeds all the harm, And makes that fire consume, which should but warm. II Till time destroy those blossomes of thy youth, Thou art our Idol-worship, at that rate, But who can tell thy fate? And say that when this Beauties done, This Lovers Torch shall still burn on; I could have serv'd thee with such truth Devoutest Pilgrims to their Saints do show, Departed long ago; And at this ebbing tyde, Have us'd thee as a Bride Who's only true Whilst you are fair, he loves himself, not you. Loves torrid Zone. [I] No, no, fair Heretick, It cannot be, But an ill love in mee, And worse for thee; For were it in my pow'r To love thee now this hour, More than I did the last, 'twould then so fall, I might not love at all: Love that can flow, and can admit encrease, Admits as well an ebb, and may grow lesse. II True love is still the same The Torrid Zones, And those more frigid ones It must not know: For love grown cold, or hot Is lust and friendship, not The think we have, for that's a flame would dye, Held down, or up too high; Then think I love, more than I can expresse, And would know more, could I but love thee lesse. To his Chloris at Parting. [I] Fain would I Chloris whom my heart adores, Longer a while between thine arms remain; But loe, the jealous morn her Rosie dores To spight me ope's, and brings the day again. Farewell, farewell, Chloris, 'tis time I dy'd, The night departs, yet still my woes abide. II Hence saucy flearing Candle of the Skies, Let us alone we, have no need of thee: Our eyes are ever day, where Chloris eyes Shine, that a pair of brighter Tapers bee, Farewell, farewell, &amp;c. III O night! whose sable vaile was wont to be More friend to Lovers, than the noisefull day: Wherefore, O wherefore do'st thou fly from me, And carry with thee all my joys away? Farewell, farewell, &amp;c. Coyness in Love. What means this Strangenesse now of late? Since Time doth Truth approve: This distance may consist with State; It cannot stand with Love. 'Tis either cunning or distrust, That do such ways allow: The first is base, the last injust; Let neither blemish you. If you intend to draw me on, You over act your part: And if it be to have me gon, You need not halfe this Art. Speak but a word, or do but cast One Look that seems to frown, I'le give you all the love that's past, The rest shall be mine own. And such a faire and equall way On both sides none can blame, Since every man is bound to play The fairest of his Game. Love possest. I wish no more thou shouldst love mee, My joys are full in loving thee; My heart's too narrow to contain My blisse, if thou shouldst love me again. Thy scorn may wound me, but my fate Leads me to love, and thee to hate; Yer I must love while I have breath, For not to love were worse than death. Then shall I sue for scorn or grace, A lingring life, or death embrace; Since one of these I needs must try, Love me but once and let me dy. Such mercy more thy fame shall raise, Than cruell life can yield thee praise; It shall be counted who so dies, No murder, but a sacrifice. A Lovers Resolution. [I] Tell not I dye, or that I live by thee, And as thou points my doom, so it must be: Or that my life (didst thou but leave to love,) Would like a long disease, as weary prove: Since he whose mind is proof against his fate, Makes himself happy at the worst estate. II 'Tis vanity for a man to build his blisse On the frail favour of a womans kisse; And most unmanly to enthrall his eye, When Heaven and Nature gives it liberty: Since Womens fancies with their fashions change, To love for fashion to each face that's strange. III I know the humour of your Sex is such You ne'r could value any one thing much; For should thy brest with constant flames be fir'd, 'Twere more then I expected, although desir'd: Then think me not so fond, although I love, But as thou stear'st thy course, so mine shal move. IV He that hath wealth, and can that wealth for-goe, Is his own man, nor slave to any woe; Thus arm'd with resolution, I am free, Still o'recommer of my destinie: Yet know I love, thou I can leave the state, He best knows how to love, knows how to hate. The Primrose. Ask me why I send you here, This firstling of the Infant year? Ask me why I send to you, This Primrose all be-pearl'd with dew? I must whisper to your Eares, The sweets of Love are wash'd with tears. Ask me why this Rose doth show All yellow, green, and sickly too? Ask me why the stalk is weak, And yeelding each way, yet not break? I must tell you, These discover What doubts and fears are in a Lover. Cupid's Embassage. [I] Go little winged Archer and convey A flaming dart Into her heart, Then steal away As soon as thou hast set her all on fire, And left her burning in her chaste desire. II Thus teach her what it is to love, that she When that her eyes Do tyrannize May pity me; And know the flame that hath my heart possest By the distemper of her scorched breast. III And when she burns if she appease my flame With smiles which fly, Oft as her eye, I'le do the same; So may we love, and burn, but ne'r expire, While we add fuell to each others fire. Coridon to his Phillis. Come lovely Phillis since it thy will is, To crown thy Coridon with daffadilles. With many kisses, as sweet as this is, I will repay to multiply thy blisses. Here I will hold thee, And thus enfold thee, Free from harms within these arms. Sweet, still be smiling, 'tis sweet beguiling Of tedious hours and sorrows best exiling; For if you lowre, the bankes no power Will have to bring forth any pleasant flower; Your eyes not granting Their raies enchanting, Mine may raine, but 'twere in vain. Thine eyes may wonder that mine asunder Do from the Sun-shine draw thine to sit under; Hold me unblam'd, to be enflam'd, Where not to be so, youth were rather sham'd: Since that the oldest That thou beholdest May feele fire of loves desire. On Chloris attractive Beauty. Cloris, farewell, I now must go, For if with thee I here doe stay, Thine eyes prevail upon me so, I shall grow blind and lose my way. Fame of thy Beauty, and thy Youth Amongst the rest me hither brought; Finding this fame fall short of truth, Made me stay longer than I thought. For thou may'st say 'twas not thy fault That thou did'st thus unconstant prove; Thou wert by my example taught To break thy oath, to mend thy love. For I'm engag'd by word and oath A servant to anothers will; Yet for thy love would forfeit both, Could I be sure to keep it still. No Chloris, no, I will return, And raise thy story to that height, That Strangers shall at distance burn, And she distrust me Reprobate. But what assurance can I take, When thou fore-knowing this abuse, For some more worthy Lovers sake, May'st leave me with so just excuse. Then shall my love this doubt displace, And gain such trust, that I may come And banquet sometimes on thy face, But make my constant meals at home. Clora forsaken, thus complains. Chloris false love made Clora weep, And by a river side Her flock which she was wont to keep, Neglecting thus she cry'd: Is't not Injustice, O ye Gods! To kindle my desire, And to leave his at so much ods, As there's no mutual fire. Poor victory, to peirce a heart That was a tender one, But cowardise to spare your dart From his that was a stone. As she thus mourn'd, the tears that fell Down from her love-sick eyes, Did in the water drop and swell, And into bubbles rise. Yet as I lessen multiply, But in lesse form appears, Thus do I languish from mine eye, And grow new in my tears. Wherein her bloubard face appears, Now out alas, said she, How do I melt away in tears For him that loves not me. Break not that Christall, circles me Sweet streams by your fair side, My love perhaps may walking be, And I may be espi'd. And thus in little drawn and drest In sad tears attire, May force such passions from his brest, Shall equall my desire. Reciprocal Love. [I] I love a Lasse, but cannot show it, I keep a fire that burns within, Rak'd up in embers: Ah could she know it, I might perhaps be lov'd again: For a true love may justly call For friendship love reciprocall. II Some gentle courteous winde betray me, A sigh by wispering in her ear, Or let some pitious shower convey me, By dropping on her breast a tear, Or two, or more; the hardest flint, By often drops receives a dint. III Shall I then vex my heart and rend it, That is already too too weak; No, no, they say, Lovers may send it, By writing what they cannot speak: Go then my Muse, and let this verse Bring back my Life, or else my Hearse. On Loves deceitful Charmes. [I] I will not trust thy tempting graces, Nor thy deceitfull charms, Nor pris'ner be to thy imbraces, Or fetter'd in thine arms: No Celia, no, not all thy art Can wound or captivate my heart. II I will not gaze upon thine eyes, Nor wanton with thy haire, Lest those should burn me by surprize, Or these my soul insnare: Nor with those smiling dangers play, Or fool my liberty away. III Since then my weary heart is free, And unconfin'd as thine; If thou would'st mine should captive be, Thou must thine own resigne: And Gratitude shall thus move more Than Love or Beauty could before. Beauty a fading Ornament. [I.] Let not thy Beauty make thee proud, Though Princes do adore thee, Since time and sickness were alow'd To mow such flowers before thee. II. Nor be not shy to that degree Thy friends may hardly know thee, Nor yet so coming, or so free, That every fly may blow thee; A state in every Princely brow, As decent is requir'd, Much more in thine, to whom they bow By Beauties lightnings fir'd. III. And yet a state so sweetly mixt With an attractive mildness; It may like Vertue sit betwixt The extreams of pride and vileness. Then every eye that sees thy face Will in thy Beauty glory, And every tongue that wags will grace Thy vertue with a story. Beauty in Eclipse. Tell me no more her Eyes are like To rising Suns, that wonder strike; For if 'twere so, how could it be, They could be thus eclips'd to me? Tell me no more her Breasts do grow Like rising Hills of melting Snow; For if 'twere so, how could they lye So near the Sun-shine of her eye? Tell me no more the restless Spheares Compar'd to her voyce, fright our ears; For if 'twere so, how then could death Dwell with such discord in her breath? No, say her Eyes Portenders are Of ruine, or some blazing starre, Else would I feel from that fair fire Some heat to cherish my desire. Say that her Breasts, though cold as Snow, Are hard as Marble, when I wooe; Else they would soften and relent With sighs inflamed, from me sent. Say that although like to the Moon. She heavenly fair, yet chang'd as soon; Else she would constant once remain Either to pity or disdain. That so by one of them I might Be kept alive, or murther'd quite; For 'tis no less cruell there to kill, Where life doth but increase the ill. Cupid detected. Silly Heart forbear, those are murd'ring Eyes, In the which I swear Cupid lurking lies: See his Quiver, see his Bow; to see his Dart, Fly, O fly! thou foolish Heart. Greedy Eyes, take heed, they are scorching Beams Causing Hearts to bleed, &amp; your Eyes spring streams: Love lies watching with his Bow bent, and his Dart For to wound both Eyes and Heart. Think and gaze your fill, foolish Heart and Eyes, Since you love your ill, and your good despise: Cupid Shooting, Cupid Darting, and his Band Mortal powers cannot withstand. Loves Flattery. When CÃ¦lia, I intend to flatter you, And tell you lyes to make you true, I swear There's none so fair, And you beleive it too. Oft have I matcht you with the Rose, and said No twins so like hath nature made, But 'tis Only in this, You prick my hand and fade. When I praise your skin I quote the wooll That Silk-worms from their Entrailes pull, And show That new fallen snow, Is not more beautifull. Oft have I said there is no pretious stone But may be found in yon alone; Though I No stone espy, Unlesse your heart be one. Yet grow not proud by such Hyperboles Were you as excellent as these Whilst I Before you ly, They might be had with ease. Loves Theft. How am I chang'd from what I was Before I saw those Eyes? I had a heart, but now alas, That room is fill'd with sighs, For she that robb'd me, would not stay To let me ask her why She stol't or beg, she'd find some way This theft with hers t'supply. Thus am I left to court my grief, For when she's out of sight, There can on earth be no relief, Or ought that's true delight. I'le therefore on some River side Wander to breath my woe, And ask those Nymphs how Hylas dy'd That I might do so too. Power of Love. [I] Since love hath in thine and mine eye Kindled a holy flame, What pity 'twere to let it dye, What sin to quench the same? The stars that seem extinct by day, Disclose their flames at night, And in a sable sense convey Their loves in beams of light. II So when the jealous Eye and Ear Are shut or turn'd aside, Our Tongues, our Eyes, may talk sans fear Of being heard or spi'd. What though our Bodies cannot meet Loves fuels more divine; The fixt stars by their twinkling greet, And yet they never joyn. III False Meteors that do change their place, Though they shine fair and bright; Yet when they covet to embrace, Fall down and lose their light. Thus while we shall preserve from waste The flame of our desire, No vestall shall maintain more chaste, Or more immortal fire. IV If thou perceive thy flame decay, Come light thine Eyes at mine; And when I feel mine waste away I'le take new fire from thine. A Motive to Love. Faith be no longer coy, But let's enjoy What's by the world confest, Women love best: Thy Beauty fresh as May Will soon decay, Besides within a year or two I shal be old, and cannot doe. Do'st think that nature can For every man, Had she more skill, provide So fair a Bride? Who ever had a Feast For a single Guest? No, without she did intend To serve the Husband and his friend. To be a little nice Sets better price On Virgins, and improves Their Servants loves; But on the riper years It ill appears: After a while you'l find this true, I need provoking more then you. On Liberty. How happy'rt thou and I that never knew how to love? Ther's no such blessing here beneath, what e're there is above; 'Tis liberty, 'tis liberty, that every wise man loves. Out, out upon those Eyes, that think to murder mee, And he's an Asse beleives her fair, that is not kind and free: Ther's nothing sweet, ther's nothing sweet to man, but Liberty. I'le tye my Heart to none, nor yet confine mine Eyes, But I will play my Game so well, I'le never want a prize: 'Tis liberty, 'tis liberty, has made me now thus wise. Beauty and Love at ods. Beauty and Love once fell at ods, And thus revil'd each other: Quoth Love, I am one of the gods, And you wait on my mother; Thou hast no pow'r ore man at all, But what I gave to thee; Nor art thou longer fair or sweet, Then men acknowledge me. Away fond Boy, then Beauty said, We see that thou art blind, But men have knowing eyes, and can My graces better find: 'Twas I begot thee, Mortals know, And call'd thee Blind desire; I made thy Arrows, and thy Bow, And Wings to kindle fire. Love here in anger flew away, And straight to Vulcan pray'd That he would tip his shafts with scorn, To punish this proud Maid: So Beauty ever since hath bin But courted for an hour, To love a day is now a sin 'Gainst Cupid and his power. Love admits no Delay. Come, O come, I brook no stay, She doth not love that can delay; See how the stealing Night Hath blotted out the light, And Tapers do supply the day. To be Chaste is to be Old, And that foolish Girle that's cold Is fourscore at fifteen, Desires do write us green; And looser Flames our Youth unfold. See the first Taper's almost gon, Thy flame like that will straight be none, And I as it expire, Not able to hold fire; She loseth Time that lyes alone. Let us cherish then these powers Whiles we yet may call them ours; Then we best spend our Time, When no Dull Zealous Chime, But sprightfull kisses strike the hour. The Anglers Song. For 2 Voc. Treble and Bass. Mans Life is but vain Mans Life is but vain, for 'tis subject to pain and sorrow, and short as a Bubble; Tis a Hodg Podg of businesse, and Money and Care, and Care and Mony, and trouble. But we'l take no Care when the Weather proves Fair, nor will we Vex now though it Rain; wee'l banish all Sorrow, and Sing till to morrow, and Angle and Angle again. On Attractive Beauty. [I] Dost see how unregarded now That piece of Beauty passes? There was a time when I did vow To that alone, but mark the fate of Faces; That Red and White works now no more on me, Than if it could not charm, or I not see. II And yet the Face continues good, And I have still desires; Am still the self-same Flesh and Blood, As apt to melt, and suffer for those fires: Oh some kind power unriddle where it lyes, Whether my Heart be faultie or her Eyes. III She every day her man doth kill, And I as often dye; Neither her Power then, nor my Will Can question'd be, what is the Mysterie? Sure Beauties Empires, like to greater States, Have certain Periods set, and Hidden Fates. Power of Love. Brightest, since your pitying Eye Saves whom it once condemn'd to die, Whom lingering Time did long dismay, You have reliev'd in this short day: Propitious gods themselves can do no more; Slow to Destroy, but active to restore. From your Fair, but absent Look, Cold Death her Pale Artilory took; Till Gentle Love that Dart supprest, And Lodg'd a Milder in your brest; Like Fam'd Acchillis mystick spear, thus you Both scatter Wounds, and scatter Balsame too. The Jovial Begger. From Hunger and Cold who liveth more free From Hunger and Cold who liveth more free, and who so richly choathed as we? Our Bellies are full, and our Flesh it is Warm, and against Pride our Rags is a Charm: Enough is a Feast to Morrow, Let rich men take care, we feel no Sorrow. A Protest against Love. No, no, I never was in Love, Nor ever hope to be; I have an Art protects my Heart From that fond Lunacie. And yet I know that I have seen A world of Taking Faces; And spent much time in finding out Their several hidden Graces. This Lady for her pretty Shape I often have admir'd: That for her Fancy and her Wit; I sometimes have desir'd. But yet I never was in Love, Nor ever hope to be: Unless some Stronger Influence Do draw my heart to thee. The Excellency of Wine. 'Tis Wine that inspires, And quencheth Love's fires, Teaches fools how to rule a State; Maids ne'r did approve it, Because those that love it, Despise and laugh at their hate. The Drinkers of Beer, Did ne'r yet appear, In matters of any Weight; 'Tis he whose designe, Is quickn'd by Wine, That raises things to their height. We then should it prize, For never black-Eyes Made Wounds which this could not heal, Who then doth refuse To drink of this Juyce, Is a Foe to the Common-Weal. Here endeth the Ayres for One or two Voyces to the Theorbo-Lute, or Basse-Viol. SECOND BOOK: CONTAINING DIALOGUES For TWO VOYCES: To be Sung to the Theorboe-Lute or Basse-Viol. A Dialogue betwixt Phillis and Clorillo. I prethee keep my sheep for me Philis. I prethee keep my sheep for me: Clorillo, wilt thou, tell? Clorillo. First, let me have a kiss of thee, and I will keep them well. Phillis. If thou a while but to my little flock will look, thou shalt have this imbroidred skrip and silver hook. Clorillo. No other favour or reward I crave, but one poor kisse. Phillis. A kisse thou must not have. Clorillo. And why? Phillis. Such enticements Maids must fly: this Garland thou shalt have of Roses and of Lillies. Clorillo. Nor Skrip, nor Hook, nor Garland sweetest Phillis, do I require, to kisse thy fresh and Rosie lip is onely my desire. Phillis. Take then a kisse, and let me goe, till I return thy care upon my flocks bestow. Chorus together. Sweet sweet is that kisse that doth with true and just desire as much another give, as to it self require. A Dialogue between Silvia and Thirsis. Dear Silvia, let thy Thirsis know Thirsis. Dear Silvia, let thy Thirsis know what 'tis that makes those tears o'reflow. Are the Kids that us'd to play and skip so nimbly gon astray? Are Cloris flowers more fresh and green? Or is some other Nimph made Queen? Silvia. Thirsis do'st thou think that I can grieve for this, when thou art by? Thirsis. What is it then? Silvia. My father bids that I no longer feed my Kids with thine but Coridons, and wear none but his Garlands on my haire. Thirsis. Why so? Why so my Silvia? Will he keep thy flocks more safe when thou do'st sleep? Will the Nimphs envy more thy praise, when chanted with his round delays? Sylvia. No Thirsis, I my flocks must joyn with his, 'cause they are more then thine. Chorus. Fathers cruell as the Rocks, joyn not their children, but their flocks, their flocks, and Hymen cals, Hymen cals to light his torches there, and Hymen cals, and cals to light his torches there, where fortune, nor affections equall are. A Dialogue between a Shepherd and Lucinda. Did not you once Lucinda vow, you would love none but me? Shepherd. Did not you once Lucinda vow, you would love none but me? Lucinda. I, but my mother tels me now I must love wealth, not thee. Shep. 'Tis not my fault, my sheep are lean, or that they are so few. Luc. Nor mine, I cannot love so mean, so poor a thing as you. Shep. Cruell, cruell thy love is in thy power, fortune is not in mine. Luc. But Shepherd, think how great my dower is in respect of thine. Shep. Ah me! ah me! Luc. Ah me! Shep. Mock you my grief? Luc. I pitty thy hard fate. Shep. Pity, for Love is poor releief, is poor relief, is poor relief, I'd rather chuse thy hate. Luc. But I must love thee. Shep. No. Luc. But I must love thee. Shep. No. Luc. Believe, Shep. No. Luc. Believe. Shep. No. Luc. I'le seal it with a kiss, and give thee no more cause to grieve then what thou findst in this: I'le give thee no more cause to grieve, then what thou findst in this. Chorus. Be witness then, be witness then you powers above, and by these holy bands let it appear that truest love grows not on wealth, grows not on wealth, grows not on wealth grows not on wealth nor lands. A Dialogue between Daphne and Strephon. Come, my Daphne, come away Strephon. Come, my Daphne, come away, we do waste the cristal day. Daphne. 'Tis Strephon calls, what would my Love? Strephon. Come follow to the Mirtle Grove, where Venus shal prepare new chaplets for thy hair. Daphne. Were I shut up within a tree, I'd rend my bark to follow thee. Strephon. My Shepherdess make haste, the minutes slide so fast. Daphne. In those cooler shades, will I blind as Cupid kisse your Eye. Strephon. In thy bosome then I'le stray, in such warm snow, who would not lose his way? Chorus. We'l laugh and leave this world behind, and gods themselves that see, shall envy thee and me, but never find such joyes when they embrace a Diety. A Dialogue between Shepherd and Shepherdess. Shepherdess. Forbear fond Swain, I cannot love. Shepherd. I prethee fair one, tell me why thou art so cold? Shepherdess. You do but move to take away my liberty. Shepherd. I'le keep thy sheep whilst thou shalt play; Delight shall make each Moneth a May. Shepherdess. Those pleasant are unthrifty hours. Shepherd. Thou shalt have the choycest flowers, wax and Hony, milk &amp; wool, of ripest fruits thy belly full. Shepherdess. My flocks I'le keep by thine. Shepherd. Not so, but let them undistinguisht go. Shepherdess. I can afford no more. Ah cease! Shepherd. Love come so far may yet increase. Shepherdess. Each day I'le grant a kiss. Shepherd. Our blisses must not conclude, but spring from kisses. Shepherdess. Then Shepherd love thy fill. Shepherd. I shall, who knows how much loves not at all. Chorus. Then draw we both our flocks up hither, That we may pitch, that we may pitch our folds together. Amidst our chast imbracements meet, our selves as blameless as our sheep. A Dialogue betwixt an Nymph and a Shepherd. Tell me Shepherd dost thou Love? Nymph. Tell me Shepherd dost thou Love? Shepherd. Tell me Nymph why wouldst thou know? Nymph. Thy wandring Flocks that without guide doth Rove thy blubber'd Eyes, that still with teares doth flow, makes me to ask. Shep. I do. Nymph. Dear Shepherd tell me who? Shep. I Love a Nymph, from whose bright Eyes PhÅbe doth her brightness borrow, where Love did first my heart surprize, where since hath sate my sorrow. Chorus together. Love sits inthron'd within the circle of bright Eyes. Nymph. But tell me Shepherd, doth her Vertues Beauty equal? Shep. As She in Beauty doth all else excel, so are her Vertues without parallel; Nymph. Doth She disdain thee? Shep. No. Nymph. Why griev'st thou then? Shep. Because her love is only worthy of the gods, not men. Chorus. Loves chiefest joy is but a pleasing anguish, who lives in Love, doth dying live, and living languish. A Dialogue between Strephon and Phillis. Shepherd in faith I cannot stay Phillis. Shepherd in faith I cannot stay, my wandring flocks call me away. Strephon. Phillis, I swear, since I have caught thee now, upon thy rosie lips I'le pay my vow. Phillis. Who lives in love, may not by force constrain. Strephon. Where imprecation false oaths must obtain. Phillis. I prethee Strephon leave me. Strephon. Dear Phillis, leave to contemn me. Phillis. Nay, then I see, nay then I see, I must my selfe defend. Strephon. Vain is all defence and art. Phillis. Cruel, cruel, thou dost of breath bereave me. Chorus. Since I have thee e're I part, I'le smother thee with kisses, printing on thy lips, printing on thy lips a thousand such as this is. Thus Strephon bold laid down his lovely Phillis. And kist her breathless, and kist her breathless upon a bank of Lillies. A Dialogue between Venus and Vulcan. Vulcan, Vulcan, O Vulcan, my Love! Venus. Vulcan, Vulcan, O Vulcan, my Love! Vulcan. Who cals? Who names me here, 'mongst flames? Venus. Sweet, hear my plaint, give sorrow ease. Vulcan. Thy sacred power who dares displease? Venus. Alas, forlorn Cupid! my wayward Son doth scorn Loves just decree, my awfull hest and heavenly Deitie. Vulcan. Is he so bold? well, for thy sake, I that his Arrows heads have us'd to make of piercing steel, which Lovers feel, will temper lead, whose force is dull, and stroke is dead. So that henceforth all men may blithly sing, Cupid's no God, his Bow a Toy, his Shaft no fearful thing. Chorus. So that henceforth all men may blithly sing, Cupid's no God, his Bow a Toy, his Shafts no fearful thing. A Dialogue between Charon and Philomel. Charon, O gentle Charon! Phil. Charon, O gentle Charon! let me woo thee with tears, and pity now to come to me. Char. What voyce so sweet and charming do I hear? Say what thou art? Phil. I prethee first draw near. Char. A sound I hear, but nothing yet I see: Speak where thou art? Phil. O Charon, pitty me! I am a shade, &amp; though no name I tell, my mournfull voyce will say I'm Philomel. Char. What's that to me? I waft, nor fish, nor fowl, nor beast, Fond thing, but only humane souls. Phil. Alas for me! Char. Shame on thy warbling note, that made me hoise my sail, and bring my boat, but Ile return: what mischief brought thee hither? Phil. A deal of love, and much, much grief together. Char. What's thy request? Phil. That since she's now beneath that fed my life, I follow her in death. Char. And's that all? I'm gone. Phil. For love I pray thee. Char. Talk not of love, all pray, but no souls pay me. Phil. I'le give thee sighs and tears. Char. Can tears pay scores for patching sails, or mending boat, or oars? Phil. I'le beg a penny, or I'le sing so long, till thou shalt say I'ave pay'd thee in a Song. Char. Why, then begin. Chorus both together. And all the while we make our sloathful passage o're the Stygian Lake, thou and Ile sing, thou and Ile sing, to make these dull shades merry; who else with tears will doubtless drown our Ferry. A Dialogue between Thyrsis and Damon. Damon. Thyrsis, kind Swain, come near, and lend a sigh, a tear, to thy sad Friend; Forsaken Damon cals. Thyrsis. Poor Wight, I come; But wherefore in this plight? Thine eyes are red, thy griefs are swelling: Tell them, Sorrow's half cur'd by telling. Damon. Take then the cause of all my woes, Phillis is gone. Thyrsis. Why, let her go, 'tis but with other Nimphs and Swains, to sport upon the Neigb'ring Plains; she'l come again, be't but to find the Heart with thee she left behind. Damon. Alas, she's taken mine! Her's free as Ayre is gone unchain'd by me, though I with such devotion sought her love, as to great Pan I ought, whilst my pale look and scatter'd sheep show'd I, nor thoughts, nor flocks could keep. Thirsis. Chere up, and lightly by her set. Damon. He never lov'd that could forget. Chorus. Love is a Riddle, which he best unties, whose reason's not betray'd by his eyes, whose reason's not betrayed, betrayed by his eyes. A Glee to Bachus with Chorus for Three voyces to be sung between every verse. To Bacchus we to Bacchus sing Chorus. To Bacchus we to Bacchus sing, with wine and mirth we'l conjure him, we'l conjure him, with wine and mirth we'l conjure him. First verse. By his Mothers Eye, and his Fathers Thigh, by her God brought to light, and his too glorious sight; By Junoes deceit, and by thy sad retreat, appear, appear, appear, appear in Bottles here. Chorus again. Second verse. By Ariadnes wrongs, and the false youths harms, by the Rock in his breast, and her tears sore opprest, By the Beauty she fled and the Pleasures of a bed, appear, appear, appear, appear in Bottles here. Third verse. By this purple Wine thus pour'd on the shrine; and by this Beer glasse to the next kind Lass; by a Girle twice nine, that will claspe like a Vine, that will claspe thee like a Vine, appear, appear, appear, appear, in Bottles here. Fourth verse. By the men thou'st won, and the women undone; By the friendship thou hast made, and the secrets betray'd; By the power over sorrow, thus charm'd till to morrow. appear, appear, appear, appear in Bottles Beer. To Bacchus, &amp;c. A Glee to the Cook. Bring out the cold Chine Bring out the cold Chine, the cold Chine to mee, and how Ile Charge him Come and see. Brawn Tusked Brawn, well sowst and fine, with a precious Cup of Muscadine. Chorus for three Voyces. How shall I sing? How shall I sing? How shall wee looke in Honour in Honour of the Master Cooke? The Pig shall turn Round, and Answer mee; Canst thou spare me a Sholder? Awy Awy. The Duck, Goose, and Capon: Good fellows all three shall dance thee an Antick, so shall the Turkey. But O! the cold Chine, the cold Chine for me. With Brewis Ile 'noint thee from Head to th'Heel, shall make thee Run Nimbler then the new oyled Wheel. With Pye-crust wee'l make thee the Eighth Wiseman to bee; but O! the cold Chine, the cold Chine, but O! the cold Chine for mee. Chorus of three Voyces again. How shall, &amp;c. The Tinker. He that a Tinker a Tinker a Tinker would be He that a Tinker a Tinker a Tinker would be, let him leave other Loves, and come listen to me: Though he travel all the Day, he comes Home late at Night, and Dallies, and Dallies with his Doxey, and Dreams of Delight. His Pot and his Tost in the Morning he takes and all the Day long good Musick he makes: He wanders the World to Wakes and to Fairs, and casts his Cap, and casts his Cap at the Court and her Cares. When to the Town the Tinker doth come, Chorus. O! how the wanton Wenches run. Some bring him basons, some bring him boles; all Wenches pray him to stop up their holes. Chorus. Tink goes the Hammer, the Skillet and the Scummer. Come bring me the Copper Kettle for the Tinker, the Tinker, the Merry Merry Tinker, O! he is the Man of Metle, O! he is the Man of Metle. A Glee. Fly Boy, Fly Boy to the Cellars bottome Fly Boy, Fly Boy to the Cellars bottome, view well your Quills and Bung, Sir: draw Wine to preserve the Lungs, Sir; not Rascally Wine, to Rot um. If the Quills run foule, be a trusty Soule, and Cane it; for the Health is such, an ill drop will much an ill drop will much profane it. Here Endeth the Second Part of this Book; being Dialogues and Glees for two Voices, to the Theorboe-Lute, or Bass-Viol. THIRD BOOK. CONTAINING Short AYRES or BALADS for Three Voyecs: Which may be sung either by a Voyce alone, or by Two or Three Voyces. [I wish no more thou shouldst love me] I wish no more thou shouldst love me I wish no more thou shouldst love me, my joys are full in loving thee; my Heart's too narrow to contain my bliss, if thou shouldst love again. [Though I am young and cannot tell] Though I am young and cannot tell, Either what love or death is well; Snd then again I have been told, Love wounds with heat, and death with cold Yet I have heard they both bear darts, And both do aime at humane hearts; So that I fear they do but bring Extreams to touch, and mean one thing. Chloris taking the Ayre. [I] Come Chloris, hie we to the Bowr' To sport us ere the day be done; Such is thy Pow'r, that ev'ry Flow'r Will ope to thee as to the Sun. II And if a Flow'r but chance to dye With my sighs blasts, or mine Eyes rain, Thou can'st revive it with thine Eye, And with thy breath mak't sweet again. III The wanton Suckling and the Vine Will strive for th'honour, who first may With their green Arms incircle thine, To keep the burning Sun away. [When Troy Town for ten years] When Troy Town for ten years Wars withstood the Greeks in manful wise When Troy Town for ten years Wars withstood the Greeks in manful wise, yet did their Foes encrease so fast, that to resist none could suffice. Waste lie those Wals that were so good, and Corn now grows where Troy Town stood. [From the fair Lavinian Shore] From the fair Lavinian Shore, I your Markets come to store. Muse not though so far I dwell, And my Wares come here to sell. Such is the sacred hunger of Gold; Then come to my Pack, While I cry what d'ye lack, What d'ye buy, for here it is to be sold. I have Beauty, Honour, Grace, Fortune, Favour, Time, and Place: And what else thou would'st request, Even the Thing thou likest best. First let me have but a touch of thy Gold, Then come to me Lad Thou shalt have what thy Dad Never gave, for here it is to be sold. Maddam, come see what you lack, Here's Complexion in my Pack; White and Red you may have in this place, To hide your old ill wrinkled Face; First let me have but a touch of thy Gold, Then thou shalt seem Like a Wench of Fifteen, Although thou be threescore Years old. [Where the Bee sucks there suck I] Where the Bee sucks there suck I Where the Bee sucks there suck I, in a Cowslips bell I lie, there I cowch when Owles do crie, on the Batts back I do flie after Summer merrilie. Merrilie merrilie shal I live now under the blossom that hangs on the bow. Merily merily shal I live now under the blossom that hangs on the bow. [When love with unconfined wings] When Love with unconfined wings hovers within my Gates When Love with unconfined wings hovers within my Gates, and my divine Althea brings to whisper at my Grates. When I lie tangled in her Hair, and fetter'd with her Eye, the Birds that wanton in the Air know no such liberty. [Do not fear to put thy feet] Do not fear to put thy feet naked in the River sweet Do not fear to put thy feet naked in the River sweet, think not Neute, nor Leech, nor Toad will bite thy foot when thou hast trod; nor let the waters, rising high, nor let the waters, rising high, as thou wad'st in make thee cry and sob, but ever live with mee, and not a wave shall trouble thee. [In the merry month of May] In the merry month of May, On a morn by break of day, Forth I walkt the Wood so wide, When as May was in her pride; There I spy'd all alone Philida and Coridon. Much adoe there was, God wot, He did love, but she could not; He said his love was to woo, She said none was false to you; He said, he had lov'd her long, She said, love should take no wrong. Coridon would have kist her then, She said, Maids must kisse no Men, Till they kisse for good and all; Then she bad the Shepherd call All the Gods to witness truth, Ne'r was loved so fair a youth. Then with many a pretty Oath, As Yea and Nay, and Faith and Troth; Such as silly Shepherds use When they would not love abuse; Love which had been long deluded, Was with kisses sweet concluded. And Phillida with Garlands gay Was Crowned the Lady May. [O my Clarissa! thou cruel Fair] O my Clarissa! thou cruel Fair, Bright as the Morning, and soft as the Air; Fresher than Flow'rs in May, Yet far more sweet than they; Love is the subject of my prayer. When first I saw thee, I felt a flame, Which from thine Eyes like lightning came; Sure it was Cupid's Dart, It peirc'd quite through my heart; Oh, could thy breast once feele the same! Let not such Fortune my Love betide; Oh, let your rocky breast be mollifi'd! Send me not to my Grave Unpittyed like a slave; How can love such usage abide? A wound so powerfull would urge thy soule, Spight of a froward heart, coyness controule, And make thy love as fixt As is the heart thou prik'st, Forcing thee with me to condole. Sympathize with me a while in grief, This passion quickly will find out relief; Cupid wil from his Bowers Warm these chill hearts of ours, And make his power rule there in chief. Then would the God of Love equall bee, Giving me ease, as by wounding thee; Then would you never scorn, When like to me you burn; At least not prove unkind to mee. [Gather your Rose buds while you may] Gather your Rose buds while you may, Old Time is still a flying; And that same Flow'r that smiles to day, To morrow will be dying. The glorious Lamp of Heaven, the Sun, The higher he is getting, The sooner will his race be run, And nearer he's to setting. That Age is best that is the first, While youth and blood are warmer; Expect not the last and worst, Time still succeeds the former. Then be not coy, but use your time, While you may go marry, For having once but lost your prime, You may for ever tarry. [Fear not, dear Love, that I'le reveal] Fear not, dear Love, that I'le reveal Those hours of pleasure we two steal, No Eye shall see, nor yet the Sun, Descry what thou and I have done. No ear shall hear our Love, but we As silent as the night will be, The God of Love himself, (whose dart Did first wound mine, and then thy heart.) Shall never know that we can tell, What sweets in stoln embraces dwell; This onely means may find it out, If when I die, Physicians doubt. What caus'd my death, and then to view Of all their judgments which was true; Rip up my heart, O then I fear The world will see thy picture there. [Fine young Folly, though you wear] Fine young Folly, though you wear That fair beauty, I did swear, Yet you ne'r could reach my heart, For we courtiers learn at school Only with your sex to fool, Y'r not worth our serious part. When I sigh and kiss your hand, Crosse mine Armes, and wondring stand, Holding fairly with your eye: Then dilate on my desires, Swear the Sun ne'r shot such fires, All is but a handsome lye. Wherefore, Madam, wear no cloud, Nor to check my flames grow proud; For insooth I much do doubt, 'Tis the powder in your hair, Not your breath perfumes the Air, And your cloaths that set you out. When I eye your Curles or Lace, Gentle soul, you think your face Straight some murder doth commit; And your conscience doth begin To be scrup'lous of my sin, When I court to shew my wit. Yet though truth hath this confest, And I swear I love in jest, Courteous soul, when next I court, And protest an amorous flame You I vow, I in earnest am, Bedlam, this is pretty sport. [Sing fair Clorinda, Whilst you may] Sing fair Clorinda Sing fair Clorinda, fair Clorinda sing, whilst you move those that attend the throne, the throne above, to leave their holy business there; shall so much harmony attend to think the sphears were made in vain? Since here's a voyce quickens the sloth of natures age, it comforts growth, it comforts growth in all her works, and can provoke a Lilly to out-live an Oake, and can provoke a Lilly, can provoke a Lilly to out-live an Oake. [Smiths are good fellows] Smiths are good Fellows Smiths are good Fellows, good Fellows, they Blow the Bellows, they Blow the Bellows, they Blow the Bellows while the Iron's hot; though there gains be small, Thy pot and my pot, come thy pot and my pot, come thy pot and my pot, and thy pot their Hammers call. Hallow, Hallow, Hallow is the White Mare Fallow, hold foot while I strike, stand fast, stand fast, stand fast with a Winion: Thy pot and my pot come thy pot, come my pot and thy pot sure 'tis but opinion Ale hurts the sight, For continually continually, Thy pot and my pot, come thy pot, come thy pot and my pot, come thy pot their Hammers call. [Musick, thou Queen of souls get up] Musick, Musick, thou Queen of souls get up Musick, Musick, thou Queen of souls get up, get up, &amp; sitting thy powerful Lute &amp; some sad, some sad Requium sing, til Cliffs requite thy Eccho with a grone, and the dull Rocks repeat the duller tone, Then on a suddain, &amp;c. The Oake her Roots, &amp;c. Chorus. Mirtles shall caper, lofty Cedars run, &amp; call the courtly palme to make up one: Then in the midst of all their jolly strain, then in the midst of all their jolly strain, strike a sad note, strike a sad note, strike a sad note and fix 'um Trees again. [See the Light bright shine] See, see, see the bright Light shine See, see, see the bright Light shine, and day doth rise; shot from my Mistris Eyes like Beams divine; her Glory doth appear and; view the purer light, Stream from her Sight stream from her Sight, when she shines clearly here: But vail her leads; Ah then you'l find how night is hurl'd about the silent world; and we left blind that darkness seems to prove, for ought we see 'tis only She make night and day to move, Then shine fair Celia lest our borrowed light; when your Sun sets, when your Sun sets, when your Sun sets, perish, perish, perish in shades of Night. [Turn Amarillis to thy Swain] Turn Amarillis to thy Swain Turn Amarillis to thy Swain turn Amarillis to thy Swain, turn Amarillis to thy Swain, thy Damon calls thee back again, thy Damon calls thee back again: Here is a pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty Arbour by, where Apollo, where Apollo, where Apollo, where Apollo, cannot cannot spy, where Apollo cannot spy. Here let's sit, and whilst I play, sing to my Pipe, sing to my Pipe, sing to my Pipe, sing to my Pipe, sing to my Pipe a Rounddelay; sing to my Pipe, sing to my Pipe, sing to my Pipe a Rounddelay. Reader. Here thou hast this Song, for Two Voyces; as it was first Compos'd by my Friend the Author, though of late Years, two Inward Parts have been added to it. J. P. [Now we are met, let's merry be] Now we are met, let's merry, merry be for one half Hour Now we are met, let's merry, merry be for one half Hour, with mirth and glee: To recreate our Spirits dull, let's laugh and sing our Bellyes full. In praise of Musick. Musick miraculous Rhethorick! that speak'st Sence Without a Tongue, excellent Eloquence: The love of thee in wild Beasts have been known, And Birds have lik'd thy Notes above their own. How easie might thy Errors be excus'd, Wert thou as much beloved, as th'art abus'd; Yet although dull Souls thy Harmony disprove, Mine shall be fixt in what the Angels love. W. D. Knight.

      <field name="fulltext">The Second Book. To all UNDERSTANDERS and LOVERS OF Vocal MUSICK. To my much Ingenuous Friend Mr. John Playford, upon his late Publication of two Excellent Books for VOCAL MUSICK, VIZ. SELECT AYRES and DIALOGUES, AND, The MUSICAL COMPANION. Treasurer of Musick, how much we Do Owe unto thy industrie! Th'unhappy Science ne'r did sound In a full Chord, 'till thou hadst bound Up in one Book, the whole Consent Of scatter'd Musick's Ornament. The Choice Composers of our Age Did each one in a private Page Whisper unto his Muse, till now They're made a Publick Quire by you; Where, like to joyful Birds by th'Spring Call'd to a pleasant Grove, they sing Not more their own felicitie, And Notes, than just Applause to thee. For why? Musick ('tis true) has been Dispos'd to Harmony, but when Were the Musicians so much like To be a Body Politique? Their Corporation incompleat Appear'd, before thou did'st the feat: The Order of thy Book shall be The List of their Societie, And none shall dare t'intrude himself, But such into their Common-wealth. Dispers'd Absyrtus's useless Parts Might be reduc'd with half the Arts That thou hast exercis'd upon Thy Musical Companion; A Piece so choice, so trim, so drest, Who would not covet such a Guest? Nor let vain Momus Carp and Cry This Work speaks thee a Plagiary, For don't we know thy depth, and skill In Musick? Thou dost change, or fill What pleaseth not, or where it wants, And regulate the false Descants. Thou art as ready to translate, As to transcribe, thy Book can say't. Thy Composition too doth raise Equal Advantage to thy praise, And though thy bashful Muse holds forth Too small a taste of her own worth, It shews enough what thou canst do, And to thy Commendation too, That in a thing so rare thou art Content thy Friends should share a part; When some like CÃ¦sar so high flown, Resolve t'have all or none their own. If pity'd Ign'rance yet should cast Spite at thy Name, Oh! let him hast For better Knowledge and Instruction To Playford's famed Introduction. If nimble Wits begin to play, Thou'rt full of Catches too, as they, And more than they can prove, or sing, Thy Notes give Life to what they bring. Th'Ingenuous Lover, when he looks For Am'rous pastime in thy Books, He'l Court thy Ayres with all Respect, Thou countenanc'st none, but are Select. And when the Virtuosi come, For that sage Train thou fittest some Good Entertainment, then set on Thy Musical Companion. A Man against the World, what shall I say? How shall I Playford call? The Field's too large, Helicon's too scant To pay a drop to every plant That sprouteth forth: And then I hear (Methinks) thy Genius drawing near, To check my vain attempt, and tell Thy self does only speak thee well. I will not therefore Gaul with Baies Thy tender Brows, nor clog with Praise Thy fertile Merit, only here Take leave to pay my thanks, for fear I tempt thy Native Modesty To flush into too deep a Dye. Cha. Pigeon. Soc. Gra. In. To my Beloved Friend and Fellow Mr. HENRY LAWES, On his Books of AYRES, lately Published. Now I have view'd this Book of thine, And find sweet Language, Notes more fine And see thy Fuges wrought in the chime, Thy Weaving far excells the Rhime; And still thy choice of Lines are good, Not like to those who get their Food As Beggars Rags from Dunghills take, (Such as comes next) ill Songs to make; Who by a witty blind pretense Take words that creep half way to sense; Hippocrates or Galen's Feet, And sing them too with Notes as meet; Songs as all th'way to Gammut tend, But in F Fa ut make an end; With killing notes which ever must Coriat. Squeez the Spheres, and intimate the Dust: These with their brave Chromaticks bring Noise to the Ear, but mean No-thing: Yet these will censure, when indeed Shew them good Lines, They cannot read; Or read them so, that in the close You'll hardly judge them Rhime from Prose. But why do I write this to Thee? This is for shop-sale Frippery; Thy richer store hath truly hit The whole Age for their want of wit: Live freely, and thy Phansie please, We shall be censur'd by such Things as these. John Wilson, Doct. in Musick. To my much Honoured Friend, Mr. HENRY LAWES, On his Books of AYRES, lately Published. Things that are thus, thus excellently good, Are hardly prais'd, 'cause hardly understood: For though at the first hearing all admire, Yet when into the severals men inquire, (which make up the Composure) they are lost, Such Ayr, Wit, Spirit, Harmony engross'd In every piece, as makes each piece the best, And yet (as good as 'tis) a Foyl to th'rest. How greedily do the best judgements throng To hear the Repetition of thy Song? Which they still beg in vain; for when Re-sung So much new Art and Excellence is flung Round thy Admirers (unobserv'd before) As makes the newly-ravish'd ravish'd more: For comprehend thee fully none can do Till like thy Musick th'are Eternal too. 'Tis Thou hast honour'd Musick, done her right, Fitted her for a strong and useful Flight; Shee droop'd and flaggd before, as Hawks complain Of the sick Feathers in their Wing and Train: But thou hast imp'd the Wings She had before. Musick does owe Thee much, the Poet more; Thou lift'st him up, and dost new Nature bring, Thou giv'st his noblest Verse both Feet and Wing. Live then above our Praise, immortal here, The Atlas, the Support of Musicks Sphere: To what a darkness would our Art decline, Robb'd of thy glorious and diurnal Shine? These fixed Tapers cannot do Thee right, Nor fully speak thy Rays which gave them Light, But as small Stars by Night in Consort met, Would only tell the World, Our Sun is Set. Charles Colman, Doct. in Musick. [The Ayres of Mr. Henry Lawes] A STORM Cloris at Sea, near the Land, is surprized by a Storm: Amintor on the Shore, expecting her Arrival, THUS COMPLAINS: Help, help, O help, Divinity of Love! Help, help, O help, Divinity of Love! or Neptune will commit a Rape upon my Cloris; She's on his bosome, and without a wonder cannot scape. See, see, the Winds grow drunk with Joy, and throng so fast to see Loves Argo, and the wealth it bears, that now the tackling and the sails they tear: They fight, they fight! who shall convey Amintor's Love into her Bay; and hurl whole Seas at one another, as if they would the Welkin smother. Hold Boras, hold; He will not hear: The Rudder cracks, the Main-mast falls; the Pilot swears, the Skipper bawls; a showre of Clouds in darkness fall, to put out Cloris light withall. Ye gods, where are ye? where are ye? Are ye all asleep, or drunk with Nectar: Why do you not keep a watch upon your Ministers of Fate? Tie up the Winds, or they will blow the Seas to heav'n, and drown your Deities. A calm, a calm! Miracle of Love; the Sea-born Queen, that sits above, hath heard Amintor's cryes, and Neptune now must lose his prize. Welcome, welcome Cloris to the Shore; Thou shalt go to Sea no more: We to Tempe's Groves will go, where the calmer winds do blow, and embarque our hearts together, fearing neither Rocks nor Weather, but out-ride the storms of Love, and for ever constant prove. No REPRIEVE. Now now Lucatia, now make hast Now now Lucatia, now make hast, if thou wilt see how strong thou art, there needs but one frown more to waste the whole remainer of my heart. Alas! undone to Fate, I bow my head ready to die, now die, and now now now am dead. You look to have an Age of tryal ere you a Lover will repay; but my state brooks no more denial, I cannot this one minute stay. Alas! undone to Fate, I bow my head ready to die; now die, and now now now am dead. Look in my wound and see how cold, how pale and gasping my Soule lies, which Nature strives in vain to hold; whilst wing'd with sighs away it flies. Alas! undone to Fate, I bow my head ready to die; now die, and now now now am dead. See see already Charon's boat, who grimly asks, Why all this stay? Hark how the fatal Sisters shout! and now they call away away. Alas! undone to Fate, I bow my head, ready to die, now die, and now now now am dead. A TALE out of Anacreon. At dead low ebb of night At dead low ebb of night, when none but Great Charles Wayn was driven on; When Mortals strict cessation keep, to re-recruit themselves with sleep; 'Twas then a Boy knockt at my gate. Who's there, said I, that calls so late? O let me In! he soon reply'd, I am a Childe; and then he cry'd, I wander without guide or light, lost in this wet, blind, Moonless night. In pity then I rose, and straight unbarr'd my dore, and sprang a light: Behold, It was a Lovely Boy, a sweeter sight ne're bless'd mine Eye: I view'd him round, and saw strange things; a Bow, a Quiver, and two Wings; I led him to the fire, and then I dry'd and, chaf'd his hands with mine: I gently press'd his tresses, curles, which new faln rain had hung with perls: At last, when warm'd, the Yonker said, Alas my Bow! I am afraid the string is wet, 'Pray (Sir) let's try; let's try my Bow. Do, do, said I. He bent it; Shot so quick and smart, as though my liver reach'd my heart. Then in a trice he took his flight, and laughing said; My Bow is right, it is O 'tis! For as he spoke, 'twas not his Bow, but my Heart is broke. To his Mistres going to SEA. Farewell, fair Saint! Farewell, fair Saint! May not the Sea and Wind swell like the Hearts and Eyes you leave behind; but calm and gentle as the Looks you bear, smile in your face, and whisper in your ear. Let no bold Billow offer to arise, that it may never look upon your Eyes; lest wind and wave, enamour'd of your form, should throng and crowd themselves into a Storm. But if it be your Fate, vast Seas! to Love; of my becalmed breast learn how to move: Move then but in a gentler Lovers pace; no furrows nor no wrinkles in your face: And ye fierce winds, see that you tell your tale in such a breath as may but fill her Sail: So whilest ye court her each your sev'ral way, ye may her safely to her Port convey; and lose but in a noble way of Wooing, whilest both contribute to your own undoing. A Complaint against Cupid. Venus redress a wrong that's done Venus redress a wrong that's done by that young sprightful Boy thy Son; he Wounds and then laughs at the Sore, Hatred it self could do no more; If I pursue, he's small and light, both seen at once, and out of sight; if I do fly, he's wing'd, and then at the first step I'm caught again. Lest one day thou thy self mayst suffer so, or clip the Wantons wings, or break his Bow. The Surprise. Careless of Love, and free from Fears, I sate and gaz'd on Stella's Eyes, Thinking my Reason or my Years Might keep me safe from all surprize. But Love, that hath been long despis'd, And made the Baud to others trust, Finding his Deity surpriz'd, And chang'd into degenerate Lust, So that too late (alas!) I find No steeled Armour is of proof, Nor can the best resolved mind Resist her Beauty and her Youth. Summon'd up all his strength and power, Making her Face his Magazine, Where Virtue's grace, and Beauty's flower He plac'd his Godhead to redeem. But yet the folly to untwist, That loving I deserve no blame; Were it not Atheisme to resist Where Gods themselves conspire her flame. Beauties Excellency. Gaze not on Swans, in whose soft breast A full hatcht beauty seems to nest; Nor Snow, which (falling from the Sky) Hovers in its Virginity. Gaze not on Roses, though new blown, Grac'd with a fresh complexion; Nor Lillies, which no subtle Bee Hath rob'd by kissing Chymistrie. For if my Emp'ress appears, Swans moultring dye, Snow melts to tears; Roses do blush and hang their heads, Pale Lillies shrink into their beds. Gaze not on that pure Milky way Where night uses splendour with the day; Nor Pearl, whose silver walls confine The Riches of an Indian Mine. The Milky way rides post, to shroud Its baffled glory in a Cloud; And Pearls do climb into her ear, To hang themselves for Envy there. So have I seen Stars big with light Prove Lanthorns to the Moon-ey'd night; Which when Sol's Rays were once display'd, Sink in their Sockets, and decay'd. To his Mistres upon his going to travel. Dearest, do not now delay me, Since thou know'st I must be gone; Wind and Tide 'tis thought doth stay me; But 'tis wind that must be blown From thy breath, whose native smell Indian Odours doth excel. O then speak, my Dearest Fair! Kill not him who vows to serve thee; But persume the Neighb'ring Air, For dumb silence else will starve me: 'Tis a word is quickly spoken, Which restrain'd, a heart is broken. Mediocrity in Love rejected. Give me more Love, or more Disdain Give me more Love, or more Disdain, the Torrid or the Frozen Zone bring equal ease unto my pain, the Temperate affords me none; either extream of Love or Hate is sweeter than a calm estate. Give me a storm, if it be Love, like Dana in that golden showre, I swim in pleasure; if it prove Disdain, that torrent will devoure my vulture hopes, and he's possest of Heav'n, that's but from Hell releas'd: Then crown my Joys, or cure my Pain; give me more Love, or more Disdain. The Self-Banished. It is not that I love you less Then when before your feet I lay, But to prevent the sad encrease Of hopeless Love I keep away: In vain alas! for ev'ry thing That I have known belong to you, Your form dares to my fancy bring, And make my old wounds bleed anew. But I have vow'd, and never must Your banish'd Servant trouble you; For if he break, you may distrust The vow he made to love you too. Who in the Spring from the new Sun Already hath a Feaver got; Too late begins those shafts to shun Which PhÅbus through his veins hath shot; Too late he would the pains asswage, And to thick shadows does retire, About with him he bears the rage, And in his tainted bloud the fire. But I have vow'd, &amp;c. To his Mistres objecting his Age. Am I despis'd because you say Am I despis'd because you say, and I believe, that I am gray? Know, Lady, you have but your day, and night will come, when men will swear Time has spilt snow upon your hair: Then when in your Glass you seek, but find no Rose-bud in your cheek; no, nor the bed to give the shew, where such a rare Carnation grew; and such a smiling Tulip too. Ah, then, too late, close in your Chamber keeping, it will be told, that you are old, by those true tears y'are weeping To a Lady, more affable since the War began. Cloris, since first our calm of Peace was frighted hence Cloris, since first our calm of Peace was frighted hence, this good we find, Your favours with your fears increase, and growing mischief makes you kind: So the fair Tree, (which still preserves her Fruit and state when no Wind blowes) in Storms, from that uprightness swerves; and the glad Earth about her strowes with treasure, with treasure from her yeelding boughs. Cloris Singing. Yes, yes, 'tis Cloris sings Yes, yes, 'tis Cloris sings, 'tis she; Mark how the Nymphs and Shepherds all flock to her: so the Master Bee the swarm leads with his awful call; so to the Thracian Lyre the floods resorted, and the listning woods: so shoals of Dolphins on the green waves spring, when Doris or her Sea-born Daughters sing; and so her Notes their hearts benum: one looks pale, others eyes ore-flow with tears of pleasure, perhaps some distil from sad hearts tears of woe; but as if fetter'd in a chain to soft their passions felt no pain, she stops no sooner, but th'inchanted throng straight cry, Sweet Cloris sing another Song. The Unconstant Lover. [I] O how I hate thee now, And my self too, For loving such a false, false thing as thee! Who hourly canst depart From heart to heart, To take new harbour as thou didst in me; But when the world shall spie, And know thy shifts as well as I, They'l shut their hearts and take thee in no more; He that can dwell with none, must out of dore. II Thy pride hath overgrown All this great Town Which stoops, and bowes as low as I to you; Thy falshood might support All the new Court Which shifts, and turn, almost as oft as thou. But to express thee by, There's not an object low, or high, For 'twill be found, when ere the measures tride, Nothing can read thy falshood, but thy pride. Night and day to his Mistres. If when the Sun at Noon displayes his brighter rays If when the Sun at Noon displayes his brighter rays, Thou but appear, he then all pale with shame and fear, quencheth his light, and grows more dim, compos'd to thee, then Stars to him. If thou but show thy face again, when darkness doth at midnight reign, darkness flyes, and light is hurl'd round about the silent world; so as alike thou driv'st away both light and darkness, night and day. To his Rivall. Seek not to know my Love Seek not to know my Love, for she hath vow'd her Constant faith to me: her milde Aspects are mine, and thou shalt onely find a Stormy brow; for if her Beauty stir desire in mee, her Kisses quench the fire: Or I can to Loves Fountain goe, or dwell upon her Hills of Snow; But when thou burn'st, shee shall not spare one gentle Breath to cool the Air; thou shalt not climbe those Alps, nor spie where the sweet Springs of Venus lie: Search hidden Nature, and there find a treasure to enrich thy mind: Discover Arts not yet reveal'd, But let my Mistress live conceal'd. Though men by knowledge wiser grow, yet here 'tis wisdome not to know. To his Mistres. I prethee Sweet to me be Kind, delight not so in Scorning I prethee Sweet to me be Kind, delight not so in Scorning; I sue for Love; O let me find some pleasure midst my mourning! What though to you I vassal be? Let me my right inherit: Send back the Heart I gave to thee, since thine it cannot merit. So I shall to the world declare how good, how sweet and fair you are. The Heart Intire. Canst thou love me, and yet doubt So much Falshood in my heart, That a way I should find out to impart Fragments of a broken Love to you, More then all b'ing less then due: O, no! Love must clear Distrust, Or be eaten with that Rust; Short Love liking may find Jars, The Love that lasteth knows no Wars. There Belief begets Delight, And so satisfies Desire, That in them it shines as Light No more Fire; All the burning Qualities appeas'd, Each in others joying pleas'd; Not a whisper, not a thought But 'twixt Both in common's brought; Even to seem Two they are loath, Love being only Soul to both. Love in Despair. A lover once I did espie A lover once I did espie with bleeding Heart and weeping Eye; he sigh'd and groan'd, and curst the Boy that planted woe, supplanted joy; he wept and cry'd, How great's his pain that lives in Love, and loves in vain! Can there (says he) no Cure be found, but by the hand that gave the wound. Then let me die, which Ile endure, since she wants Charity to Cure: Yet let her one day feel the pain to wish sh' had cur'd, but wish in vain; for wither'd cheeks may chance recover some sparks of Love, but not a Lover. Loves Fruition. Come come, thou glorious object of my sight Come come, thou glorious object of my sight: O my Joy, my Life, my only Delight! May this glad Minute be blest to Eternitie. See how the glim'ring Tapers of the Sky do gaze and wonder at our Constancy: How they croud to behold what our Arms do unfold! How all do envy our Felicities, and grudge the Triumph of Selindras Eyes! How Cynthia seeks to shroud her Crescent in yon Cloud, where sad Night puts her sable Mantle on thy Light; mistaking hasteth to be gone, her gloomy Shades give way as at th'approach of Day, and all the Planets shrink for fear to be ecclips'd by a brighter Deitie. Look, O look, how the small Lights do fall and adore what before the Heavens have not shown, nor their godhead known. Such a Faith, such a Love as may move Mighty Jove from above to descend and remain amongst Mortals again. Love in the Spring. [I] Pleasure, Beauty, Youth attend ye; Love and Melting thoughts befriend ye: While the spring of Nature lasteth Use your time ere Winter hasteth. II Active blood and free delight, Place and Privacy invite: O be kind as you are fair, Lose no advantage got for Air. III She is cruel that denies it, Stealth of sport in love supplies it: Bounty best appears in granting, Else the Ears of Love are wanting. IV There's the sweet Exchange of Bliss Where each Whisper proves a Kiss: In the Gain are felt no pains, For still in all the Loser gains. The Lark. Swift through the yielding Air I glide Swift through the yielding Air I glide, while nights shall be, shades abide: Yet in my flight (though ne're so fast) I Tune and Time the wilde winds blast: And ere the Sun be come about, teach the young Lark his Lesson out; who early as the Day is born sings his shrill Anthem to the rising Morn: let never Mortal lose the pains to imitate my Aiery strains, whose pitch too high for humane Ears, was set me by the tuneful Spheres. I carrol to the Faries King, wakes him a mornings when I sing: And when the Sun stoops to the deep, Rock him again and his fair Queen asleep. Loves Dying Passion. Amarillis tear thy hair Amarillis tear thy hair, beat thy breast, sigh, weep, despair; cry cry Ay me! Is Daphne dead? I see a paleness on his brow, and his cheeks are drown'd in snow; Whether, whether, whether are those Roses fled? O my heart! how cold, how cold he's growne? Sure his Lips are turn'd to stone. Thus, Thus then I offer up my blood, and bathe my body in his shrowd. Since living accents cannot move, Know Amarillis, know Amarillis dy'd for Love. On a lost Heart. What shall I do? I've lost my Heart What shall I do? I've lost my Heart; 'tis gone I know not whether: Cupid cut's strings, then lent him wings and both are flowne together. Fair Ladies, tell, for Loves sweet sake, Did any of you find it? Come come, it lies in your Lips or Eyes, though you'l not please to mind it. Well, If 'tis lost, then farewell frost, I will enquire no more; for Ladies they steal Hearts away but only to restore. Loves Flattery. Ladies, fly from Loves smooth Tale Ladies, fly from Loves smooth Tale, Oaths steep'd in tears do oft prevaile: Grief is Infectious, and the Air inflam'd with sighs will blast the Fair: Then stop your Ears when Lovers cry, lest your selves weep when no lost Eye shall with a sorrowing tear repay that pity which you cast away. Young men, fly when Beauty darts Am'rous glances at your hearts; the fixt mark gives the Shooter aim, and Ladies looks have power to maim: Now 'twixt the Lips, now in their Eyes, wrapt in a Kiss or Smile Love lies. Then fly betimes, for only they Conquer Love that run away. A Dream. I laid me down upon a pillow soft I laid me down upon a pillow soft, and dream'd I clypt and kist my Mistress oft: She cry'd, Fie fie, away, you are too bold. I pray'd her be content, though she were cold, my veins did burn with flames of hot desire, and must not leave till she had quench'd my fire. Well, since (said she) I may not from you fly, do what you please, I give you liberty. With that I wak'd, but found I was deceiv'd; for which I storm'd like one of sense bereav'd. Upon the Hearing Mrs. Mary Knight Sing. You that think love can convey no other way but through the Eye You that think love can convey no other way but through the Eye into the heart his fatal dart; Close up those Casements, and but hear this Syren sing, and on the wings of her clear voyce it will appear that Love can enter at the Ear. Then unveil your Eyes, behold the Curious mold where that voyce dwells: and as we know when the Cocks crow we freely may gaze on the day, So may you when the Musicks done, awake and see the Rising Sun. The Thrifty Lover. I lov'd thee once, Ile love no more I lov'd thee once, Ile love no more; thine be the grief as is the blame: Thou art not what thou wert before; What reason I should be the same? He that can love unlov'd again, hath better store of Love than Brain. God send me Love my Debts to pay, whilest Unthrifts fool their Love away. A Lover on his Dying Mistres. Death cannot yet extinguish that entire pure flame her Eys did kindle in my breast Death cannot yet extinguish that entire pure flame her Eys did kindle in my breast: now they are clos'd, and she is laid to rest, my heart hath embers left of chaste desire, which as the Elements, so they require something to feed and keep alive the rest, that heart in which her Image was exprest, shall be the fuel, sighs shall blow the fire: There now she seems to move her sweetest Lips, which ever must be so till they be none, bids me not grieve, she's but eclips'd who from the Eys, not from the Heart is gone; yet with mine Eys my Heart shal bear a part, because mine Eys first brought her to my Heart. The Fly. When this Fly liv'd she us'd to play When this Fly liv'd she us'd to play in the Sunshine all the day, till coming neer my CÃ¦lia's sight, she found a new and unknown light, so full of glory as it made the Noon-day Sun a gloomy shade. Then this am'rous Fly became my Rivall, and did court my flame; she did from hand so Bosome skip; and from her breath, her cheek, her lip, suckt all the Incense, Mirrhe and Spice, and grew a Bird of Paradice. At last into her Eye she flew; there scorcht with flames, and drown'd in dew, like Phaeton from the Suns sphere she fell, and with her dropt a Tear, of which a Pearl was streight compos'd, wherein her Ashes lie inclos'd: Thus she receiv'd from CÃ¦lia's Eye, Funeral flame, Tombe Obsequie. Loves Torment. I was foretold your Rebel Sex nor love nor pity knew, And with what scorn you use to vex poor Hearts that humbly sue: But I believe, to crown our pain, could we the fortress win, A happy Lover sure should gain a Paradice within. I thought Loves plagues like Dragons sate, Only to fright us at the Gate. If I did enter and enjoy what happy Lovers prove, I would Kiss, and Sport, and Toy, and taste those Sweets of Love: Or had they but a lasting fate, or if in CÃ¦lia's breast, Or of Love might not abate, Jove was too mean a Guest: But now her breach of faith far more Afflicts than did her Scorn before. Hard Fate! to have been once possest as Victor of a Heart, Atchiev'd with labour and unrest, and then forc'd to Depart. If the stout foe will not resigne when I besiege a Town, I lose but what was never mine; but he that is cast down From Injoy'd Beauty, feels a woe Only deposed Kings can know. Love Unveil'd. When thou, Fair CÃ¦lia! When thou, Fair CÃ¦lia! like the Setting Sun, shalt blush to see thy Day is done: And I a Martyr in thy Virgin flame, though dead bespot thy living fame, and call thee Murdress; Then thou shalt see thou hast deceiv'd thy self, not me: When from my constant Ashes Truth shall rise, and silence thy intended Obsequies. Then unpitied thou shalt fall, and we both die by each others Cruelty. Yet, pitious Fates! will not I die unmourn'd, though we both die, and both die scorn'd. The Mournful Lovers. Come, come, sad Turtle, mateless moaning Come, come, sad Turtle, mateless moaning; droop no more for want of Owning: Here's a Breast for your Nest, like an Altar Cypress drest, sacrificing griefful groaning. Come, sad Turtle, O come hither, our fate's alike, let's die together. Come come, and use sigh-soothing skill, and with Loving gently kill, soon as Asps fatal clasps, whilest your sad glad feeder gasps, feed on woe, and feast your fill. Come, sad Turtle, O come hither; our Fate's alike, Let's die together. Loves Power. Behold and listen whilst the Fair breaks in sweet sound the willing Air Behold and listen whilst the Fair breaks in sweet sound the willing Air: And with her own breath fans the fire which her bright Eyes did first inspire. What reason can that Love controll which two such ways commands the Soul. So when a flash of Lightning falls on our abodes, the danger calls for humane aid, with hopes the flame to conquer though from Heaven it came: But if the winds with it conspire, Men strive not, but deplore the fire. Loves Ardency. No more of Tears, I've now no more to quench my flame No more of Tears, I've now no more to quench my flame, but make it scorch the more: My sighs that should have cool'd my hot desire, blow my flame high, and set me all on fire. No remedy to Cure me? Yes, there's one: If thou wilt girt me in thy Frozen Zone, then may I be as thou art, or make thee melt thy white snow, and turn to fire like me. The Nightingale. Hark how the Nightingale displayes The latest pleasures of her throat, And dies content, if her poor Note Might serve but as one step to raise A Trophie to your Beauties praise. The Rose, in whose rich Odours lie The perfum'd Treasures of the Year, Doth blush to death when you appear, And Martyr-like towards you doth fly, To wear your Cheeks fresh Livery. Aurora weeps to see a light Outvie her splendour in your Eyes, The Sun's asham'd to walk the skies; And th'Envious Moon, grown pale for spight, Vows ne're to Revel but with Night. The saucy Wind with senseless care (Seeming to feel soft sense of bliss) Steals through your hair, your lips to kiss, So Rivals me, who now despair To touch your Lip, Cheek, Eye or Hair. Loves Constancy. That flame is born of Earthly fire That soon enjoys, and soon expires: His love with wings Ill-feather'd flies, That cannot reach beyond his Eyes. Where Hope doth fan the Idle fire 'Tis easie to Maintain desire; But that's the Noble Love that dare Continue Constant in Despare. Cupid's Alarm. Whether so gladly and so fast, As if you knew all danger past Of Combate and of War: As you believ'd my arms were bound; Or when I shoot, that ev'ry wound I make is but a Scar. Arm now your breasts with shields of Steel, And plates of Brass, yet you shall feel My Arrows are so keen, Like Lightning that not hurts the skin, Yet melts the sollid parts within; They'l wound although unseen. My Mother taught me long ago To aim my Shafts, and draw my Bow, When She did Mars subdue: And now you must resigne to Love Your warlike Shafts, that She may prove Those Antique stories true. Beauties Excellency. Transcendent Beauty! thou that art light to mine Eyes, life to my Heart Transcendent Beauty! thou that art light to mine Eyes, life to my Heart: And in whose Virtue rests alone the only true Philosophers Stone: For as th'Elixir can restore Nature decay'd as 'twas before, thy power hath wrought a stranger thing, by changing Autumn to a Spring. Sympathy in Love. Weep not, my dear for I shall go Loaden enough with my own woe; Add not thy heaviness to mine, Since Fate our Pleasures must disjoyn. Why should our Sorrows meet, if I Must go and leave thy Company? I wish not there's it shall relieve My Heart, to think thou dost not grieve. Yet grieve and weep, that I may bear Every Sigh and every Tear; And it shall glad my Heart to see Thou wert thus loth to part from mee. A Remembrance. [1] On this swelling bank (once proud Of its burthen) Cloris lay: Here she smil'd, and did uncloud Those bright Suns ecclipse the day. 2 Here we sate, and with kind art She about me twin'd her arms, Clasp'd in hers my hand and heart Fetter'd by those pleasing charms. 3 Here my love and joys she crown'd Whil'st the hours stood before me, With a killing glance did wound And a melting kiss restore me. 4 On the doun of either breast Whil'st with joy my soul retir'd, My resigning heart did rest Till her lips new life inspir'd. 5 The renewing of these sights, Doth with grief and pleasure fill me, And the thought of those delights Both at once revive and kill me. Sufferance. [1] Delicate Beauty, why should you disdain With pity at least, to lessen my pain? Yet if you purpose to render no cause, Will, and not Reaon, is judge of those Laws. 2 Suffer in silence I can with delight Courting your anger to live in your sight; Inwardly languish, and like my disease, Always provided my sufferance please. 3 Take all my comforts in present away, Let all but the hope of your favour decay; Rich in reversion I'le live as content, As he to whom Fortune her fore-lock hath lent. Mutual affection between Orinda and Lucatia. Come, my Lucatia, since we see That miracles mens faith do move By wonder and by prodigie: To the fierce angry world let's prove There's a Religion in our Love. For though we were design'd t'agree, That Fate no liberty destroys, But our Election is as free As Angels, who with greedy choice Are yet determin'd to their joys. Our hearts are doubled by their loss, Here mixture is addition grown, We both difuse, and both ingross, And we whose minds are so much one, Never, yet ever are alone. We court our own captivity, Then Thrones more great and innocent, 'Twere banishment to be set free, When we wear fetters, whose intent Not bondage is, but ornament. Divided joys are tedious found, And griefs united easier grow, We are our selves but by rebound, And all our titles shuffl'd so, Both Princes, and both Subjects too. Loves Parting. But that I knew before we met, The hour would come that we must part, And so had fortifi'd my heart, I hardly could escape the net, My Passions for my Reason set. But why should Reason hope to win A Victory that's so unkind, And so unwelcom to my mind; To yield is neither shame nor sin, Besieg'd without, betray'd-within. But Friends ne're part (to speak aright) For who's but going is not gone; Friends like the Sun must still move on, And when they seem most out of sight, There absence makes at most but night. And though that night be ne're so long, In it they either sleep or wake: And either way enjoyments take, In Dreams or Visions which belong Those to the old: these to the young. I'm old when going, gone 'tis night, My Parting then shall be a Dream, And last till the auspicious Beam Of our next meeting gives new light, And the best Vision that's your sight. The Rose. Go lovely Rose, Tell her that wasts her time and me, That now she knows When I resemble her to thee, How sweet and fair she seems to be. Tell her that's young, And shuns to have her graces spi'd, That hadst thou sprung In Desarts where no men abide, Thou must have uncommended dy'd. Small is the worth Of beauty from the light retir'd, Bid her come forth, Suffer her self to be desir'd, And not blush to be admir'd. Then die, that she The common fate of all things rare May read in thee, How small a part of time they share, That are so wondrous sweet and fair. Active Love. Tell me no more 'tis Love Your passions move In a fantastick sphere, And only there: Thus you confine What is divine, When Love hath pow'r, and can dispense Sufficient to the soul and sense. 'Tis Love the sense informs, And cold bloud warms; Nor gives the soul a Throne To us alone, But bids them bend Both to one end; And then 'tis Love when thus design'd They make another of their kind. Not to be altred from Affection. Can so much Beauty own a mind? Oresway'd by tyranny, As new afflicting ways to find A doubtless faith to try, And all example to out-do, To scorn and make me jealous too: Alass! she knows my fires are too great; And though she be Stone ice to me, Her thaw to others cannot quench my heat. That Law which with such force o're-ran The Armies of my heart, When no one thought I could out-man, That durst once take my part. For by assault she did invade, No composition to be made: Then, since all must yield as well as I to stand in aw of Victors Law There's no prescribing in captivity. That Love which loves for common ends, Is but self-loving love; But nobler conversation tends Soul mysteries to prove. And since Love is a passive thing, It multiplies by suffering. Then, though she throw life to the waning Moon, on him her shine, the dark part mine, Yet I must love her still when all is done. Policy in Love. Art thou in Love? It cannot be; 'Twill prove too great a Raritie: For Love is banisht from the mind, And every Creature proves unkind. Your sex we know hath too much power To be confin'd above an hour, And Ladies are become so wise They'l please their own, not others Eyes. No Archers from above are sent Poor Cupid's Bow lies now unbent, And Women boast that they can find A nearer way to please the mind. Yet still you sigh and keep adoe Only to tempt poor men to wooe: But sure if thou a Lover be 'Tis of thy Self, but not of Me. A Glee at Christmas. Tis Christmas now, 'tis Christmas now, When Cato's self would laugh, And smoothing forth his wrinkled brow, Gives liberty to Quaff, To Dance, to Sing, to Sport and Play; For ev'ry hour's a Holy-day. And for the Twelve days, let them pass In mirth and jollity: The Time doth call each Lad and Lass That will be blithe and merry Then Dance, and Sing, &amp;c. And from the Rising of the Sun To th'Setting cast off Cares; 'Tis time enough when Twelve is done To think of our Affairs. Then Dance, and Sing, &amp;c. The Power of Love. Where shall a man an object find that may preserve a quiet mind? Where shall a man an object find that may preserve a quiet mind? Sad sorrow dwells in Loves fair Eyes, and Beauty stirs up Jealousies: A Lovers Hopes are mixt with Fears, and all his Joys, and all his Joys do end in Tears: Yet I must love, though't be my fate to be rewarded still with hate; for by experience now I feel Loves Darts are all Magnetick steel: For when I fly to ease my pain, an Arrow draws me back again. Orpheus Hymn. O King of Heaven and Hell, of Sea and Earth! O King of Heaven and Hell, of Sea and Earth! who shak'st the world when thou shout'st Thunder forth; whom Devils dread, and Hosts of Heaven praise, whom Fate (which masters all things else) obeys: Eternal Cause! who on the Winds dost ride, and Natures face wit, thick dark Clouds dost hide; Cleaving the Air with Balls of dreadful Fire; Guiding the Stars which run, and never tire. About thy Throne bright Angels stand, and Bow to be dispatch'd to Mortals here below. Thy early Spring in Purple robes comes forth: Thy Summers South does conquer all the North: And though thy Winter freeze the Hearts of Men, glad wine, from Autumn cheers them up agen. Here endeth the AYRES of Mr. Henry Lavves. [Ayres for one Voice to the Theorbo or Bass Viol] A Blackmore Maid wooing a Fair Boy. Why, Lovely Boy, why fly'st thou me Why, Lovely Boy, why fly'st thou me, that languish in these flames for thee? I'm Black, 'tis true; why, so is Night, and Love doth in Dark shades delight. The whole world, do but close thine eye, will seem to thee as Black as I; or op't, and see what a Black shade is by thine own fair body made, that follows thee where ere thou go: O who allow'd would not do so? Let me for ever dwell so nigh, and thou shalt need no other Shade than I. The Boys Answer to the Blackmore Maid. Black Maid, complain not that I fly Black Maid, complain not that I fly, since Fate commands Antipathy: Prodigious might that Union prove, where Night and Day together move; and the Conjunction of our Lips, not Kisses make, but an Ecclipse; in which the mixed Black and White pretends more Terrour than Delight: Yet, if my Shadow thou wilt be, enjoy thy dearest wish: But see thou take my Shadows property, that hastes away when I come nigh. Else stay till Death hath blinded me; and then I will bequeath my self to thee. A Sacrificed Heart. When I am Dead, and thou wouldst try the truth of Loves great Mysterie When I am Dead, and thou wouldst try the truth of Loves great Mysterie, When thou a Sparkle dost espie Dancing before thy brighter Eye, O! do not doubt that Sparkle came from the Fervour of my Hearts flame; which thus to prove, open the Urn wherein my restless Ashes burn: Then rake that Dust, and thou shalt see the Fire remains that burns for thee. Cupid Scorned. Boast not, Blind Boy, that I'm thy prize; 'Twas not thy Dart, But these that feather'd with her Eys First took my heart. Th'ill tutor'd Shafts, and childish Bow On faintly Loving hearts bestow. I vaunt my Flames, and dare defie Those Bug-bear Fires Which only serve to satisfie Fools fond Desires: Hord up for such thy Painted flame As tremble when they hear thy Name. My Heart thy Fires nor Shafts could peirce, But holy Flashes Swifter than Lightnings, or more fierce, Burnt mine to Ashes; Where let them sleep in unknown rest, Since Fate concludes thy Urn her Breast. On a Proud Lady. Still to be Neat, still to be Drest As you were going to a Feast: Still to be powder'd still perfum'd! Lady, it is to be presum'd, Though Arts hid Causes are not found, All is not sweet, All is not sound. Give me a Look, give me a Face That makes Simplicity a Grace; Robes Loosly flowing, Hair as Free; Such sweet neglects more taketh me Then all th'Adult'ries of Art; They strike my Eyes, but not my Heart. To an Inconstant Lover. Wilt thou be gone, thou Heartless man? Here's none seeks to do thee wrong: Here's food would warm the Coldest blood, Joys would make an old man young: Here are Eyes that would move Stones To pity, Rocks to Love, Cheeks of a Vermilion hew Sweet as Roses in a dew. Who but a silly Swain, or foolish Guest, For homely Cates would leave so dainty a feast. Wilt thou begon, thou Frosty man, Is not Beauty a fair prize; Dost rate thy pelf with true Loves wealth: Foolish man, where are thine Eyes? Here are Lips both fresh and fair, Red as Cherries in their prime, Globe-like Breasts both smooth and white, Full of pleasure and delight: Who but Ass would leave such dainty store To feed on Thistles, when better meat's before. Go get thee gone, thou Senseless man, And make Marts with such as she Who, both in Kind and Currish mind Ev'ry way's as base as thee; That hath Eyelids like some Witch, Wrinkled Cheeks as black as pitch, Lips as pale; and for her Breast, Lank and loathsome as the rest: May she disgrace her Sex, and thee so far That thou mayst languish t'death with Loathing her The Marigold. [1.] Mark how the Blushful morn in vain Courts the Amorous Marigold With sighing Blush, and weeping Rain, Yet she refuses to unfold. But when the Planet of the Day Approacheth with his powerful Ray, Then She spreads, then She receives his Warmer beams into her Virgin Arms. 2. So may'st thou thrive in Love, fond Boy, If silent tears and sighs discover Thy grief, thou never shalt enjoy The just reward of a bold Lover. 3. But when with moving accent thou Shalt constant Faith and Service vow, Thy CÃ¦lia shall receive those charms With open Ear, and with unfolded Arms. Loves Constancy. No more shall Meads be deckt with flowers No more shall Meads be deckt with flowers, nor Sweetness live in Rosie Bowers; nor greenest Buds on Branches spring, nor warbling Birds delight to sing; nor April Violets paint the Grove, when once I leave my CÃ¦lia's Love, when once I leave my CÃ¦lia's Love. THE Fish shall in the Ocean burn, and Fountains sweet shall bitter turn; the humble Vail no Floods shall know, when Floods shall highest Hills ore-flow: Black LÃ¦the shall Oblivion leave, before my CÃ¦lia I deceive, before my CÃ¦lia I deceive. LOVE shall his Bow and Shafts lay by, and Venus Doves want wings to fly: The Sun refuse to show his Light, and Day shall then be turn'd to Night; and in that Night no Star appear, when ere I leave my CÃ¦lia dear, when ere I leave my CÃ¦lia dear. LOVE shall no more inhabit Earth, nor Lovers more shall love for Worth; nor Joy above in Heaven dwell, nor pain torment poor Souls in hell: Grim Death no more shall horrid prove; when ere I leave bright CÃ¦lia's Love, when ere I leave bright CÃ¦lia's Love. Love Enflamed. [1.] Fire, Fire; Lo here I burn in such desire, That all the tears that I can strain Out of my Love-sick empty brain, Cannot allay my scorching pain. Come Humber, Trent, and silver Thames: Dread Ocean haste with all thy Streams, And if thou canst not quench my Fire, O drown both me and my Desire. 2. Fire, Fire, there is no Hell to my desire; See all the Rivers backward fly, For fear my Heart should drink them dry; Come Heavenly showers, come pouring down, Come you that once the World did Drown; And if you cannot quench my Fire, O Drown both me and my Desire. Unwilling Parting. No no, I tell thee no No no, I tell thee no; though from thee I must go, yet my Heart says not so: It swears by Stella's eys, in whose daz'ling surprize it in Loves fetters lies: It swears by those Roses and Lillies so white, and those Rubies so bright, ne'r to part, ne'r to part from my dear dear Delight. The Dying Lover. [1] Stay, Silly Heart, and do not break, But give a Lover leave to speak, To tell a Tale that Stones may move To pity me that dies for Love. 2 Thy Heart is harder far than flint, And will not suffer Cupid's print; But beats his Arrows back to Jove, By which, alas! I die for Love. 3 When I am gone, true Lovers mourn, Deck all your heads with Wither'd Corn; Wear on your Hand a Sable Glove, To testifie I dy'd for Love. 4 Then bear me softly by her dore, And there with Mourning Heads deplore, Cry loud, look down you Pow'rs above, On her that slew me for her Love. 5 Then in an unfrequented Cave Where Fairies haunt, prepare my Grave Among wilde Satyrs in a Grove, That they may sing, I dy'd for Love. 6 Last, build my Tombe of Lovers bones, Set round about with Marble-stones; My Scutch'on bearing Venus Dove; My Epitaph, I dy'd for Love. The Lilly. White though you be White though you be, yet Lillies know from the first ye were not so: But Ile tell ye what befell ye; Cupid and his Mother lay in a Cloud while both did play: He with his prety finger prest the Ruby Nipple of her Breast; out of the which the Cream of Light like to a dew fell down on you, and made you White. Wounded in Love. For that one glance I wounded lie, O look again, and let me die: Kill me outright; I cannot brook To live like one that's Planet strook. Bless me again with those bright rays That shorten, yet make sweet my days. O shoot more Glances with thine Eyes To shew th'accept'st the Sacrifice Of my poor Heart, which now doth burn Whilest I both Priest and Offering turn. Ile blame no more those Eyes that prove My ruin, since they caus'd my Love. Loves Affection. Be not proud, Pretty one, for I must love thee; Thou art Fair, but Unkind, yet dost thou move me. Red is thy Lips, and Cheeks like to thy Blushes: The Flame that's in thine Eye burns mine to Ashes. And on thy Breast, the place of Loves abiding, Sits Cupid high enthron'd my pain deriding. O! if a god thou art, wound Her that scorns me, Or fall from that bright Sphere which so adorns thee. Then might my Sighs and Tears move her Compassion, And on her Heart of Flint make some Impression; Knowing her Beauty hath so far insnar'd me, And all the Joys of Peace hath quite debarr'd me. O Gentle Nymph! thy Frown now would destroy me, Having liv'd but in hope Once to injoy Thee: And sure my Death would add nought to thy Glory, But rather all your Fame die in the Story. Cupid's Doomsday. Wake all ye dead: What hoo! What hoo! How soundly they sleep whose pillows lie low? They mind not poor Lovers who walk above On the Decks of the world in storms of Love: No whisper now or Glance can pass Through Wickets, or through Panes of Glass; For our Windows and Dores are shut and barr'd, Lie close in the Church, and in the Church-yard: In ev'ry Grave make room, make room; The World's at an End, and we Come, we Come. The State is now Loves Foe, Loves Foe, T'has seiz'd on his Arms, his Quiver and Bow; T'has pinion'd his Wings, and fetter'd his Feet, Because he made way for poor Lovers to meet: But oh sad chance! his Judge was old; Hearts cruel grow, when blood grows cold: No Man being young, his Process would draw; Oh Heav'ns! that Love should be subject to Law; Lovers go Wooe the Dead, the Dead l Lye two in a Grave, and to Bed, to Bed. Madness in Love. [I.] Sure 'twas a Dream: How long, Fond Man, have I Been lull'd into Captivity? My Newgate was my Want of Wit, I did my Self commit, my Bonds I Knit: I my own Gaoler was, my only Foe That did my freedome disallow: I was a Prisoner 'cause I would be so. II. 'Twas a fine life I liv'd when I did dress My self to Court your peevishness; When I did at your foot-stool lye, Expecting from your eye to live or dye. Now frowns or smiles, I care not which I have; Nay, rather than I'le be your slave, I'le Court the Plague to send me to my grave. III. And now I will shake off my chains, and prove Opinion built the Gaol of Love; Made all his Bonds, gave him his Bow, His bloody Arrows too which murder so. May all the Oaths which idle Lovers dream, Be all contriv'd to make a Theam For some carousing Poets drunken Flame. Love and Honour. That Herald he was but a dull Ass Who before Love gave Honour the place; For Nature and Love are both of a date, And Honour but yesterday set up her State. Honour we grant's the Daughter of Love, And this doth them their Precedess prove; For Honour's but Heat, 'tis Love is the Fire; This may Preserve, but that Kindles Desire. If you take away Love, then Dame Honour must Come down a degree, and lie in the Dust: 'Tis a Green-sickness fancy to famish Love, And feed upon Honour, which fatal may prove. Then you may leave off, for 'tis Labour in vain By Reason to Cure a True Lovers pain: Then farewell dull Mortall, since it is most true That with Honour and Love thou hast nothing to doe. Cupid's Monarchy. If you will Love, know this to be The Laws of Cupid's Monarchy; That to Refuse Is to abuse Loves Government; and I declare, That such Loves Rebels, not his Subjects are. To Love is not to be your Owne, Love studies to please them alone Whom it affects With most respects Of ought beside; for Love confin'd Is but by Usurpation Love defin'd. If you did Love as true as I, You nothing would or cold deny, But would conceive That you receive What you bestow: If this were true, Your Heart would dwell in me as I in you. The Vicissitude of Love. [I] Ah! Cloris, would the Gods allow We still might Love as we Love now, What Joys had all the world in store, Or Heav'n it self to give us more; For nothing sure so sweet can prove As pleasures of beginning Love. II But Love when to its height arrivd Of all our Joys is shortest liv'd; His Morning past, he Sets so soon That none can find an Afternoon: And of that little time is lent Half in Unkindness is misspent. III Since Fate to Love such short Life gives And Love so tender whilest he lives, Let us remove Mean fears away, So to prevent his first decay: For Love, like blood, let out before, Will lose his pow'r, and Cure no more. Loves Hue and Cry. Oft have I searcht both Court and Town, and Country Village too, The Black, the Fair, the lovely Brown, Bold, Coy and Simple too; Yet amongst all I ne'r could find One that's more Constant than the Wind. If nobly born, She scorns to be Confined in her Love; If Riches make her melt, we see varietie she'l prove: And She whom Want betrays, no less Counts Change her only happiness. Since all will try, Ile now no more court dangerous Constancy, But Ile change Objects, and adore this sweet Variety: For, taught by their Example, I Love nothing now but Liberty. Cupid's Progress. Vp Ladies, Up; prepare your Taking faces; For Cupid rides a Hunting to day in Secret places; His Bow is ready bent, to shew you his Intent; His Quiver full of Darts, to wound the chiefest Hearts: Then follow follow me all you that Gamesome be. See where he comes with all his Am'rous Train! Mark how the Ladies do trip it or'e the Plain! His Gallants and his 'Squires, all clad in warm desires; And those that did retire, Come on with fresh desire: Then follow follow me, all you that Gamesome be. Endymion's Dream. Fall dew of Slumbers in a gentle Stream, And my Endymion bless; That he i'the Banquet of a Dream May taste his future Happiness. Softly, softly; O let no rude affright As he lies! Break up his eyes, But open them to real new Delight. Drest Seraphins, put on your softest wings; Glide eas'ly from above: With blisses Heavens fruition brings Refresh the panting hopes of Love. Charm him, Charm him: Then with a Bee-like Hum Gently wake For Hero's sake Leander from Elizium. Love admits no Rivall. [I] Indeed I never was but once so mad To dote upon the Beauty of a Face; And then, alas! my fortune was so bad, To see another chosen in my place; And yet I courted Her I'm very sure With Love as true as his, and full as pure. II But if I ever be so fond again To undertake the second part of Love; Or reassume that most unhappy pain, Or after Shipwrack do the Ocean prove: She shall be tender-hearted, kind and free; Or I'le be as Indifferent as She. Transparent Love. Cloris, 'twill be for eithers rest Timely to know each others Breast: I'le make the Obscure parts of mine Cleer as your Charming Beauty shine: And if you'l deal but so with me, We soon shall part, or soon agree. 1 Know then, though you were twice as fair, If it could be, as now you are; Or if the Graces of the Mind With a supportant Beauty shin'd; Yet if you love me not, you'l see I value those as you do me. 2 Though I a thousand times have sworn, My Passion should transcend your Scorn; Or that your bright triumphant Eyes Creates a flame that never dyes; Yet if to me you prove untrue, Those Oaths should prove as false to you. 3 Though I should Love, and you should Hate, 'Twas (I confess) a meer Deceit; And that my Flames should Deathless prove, 'Twas but to render so your Love. I brag as, Cowards use to do, Of Danger, they ne'r run into. 4 But now my Tenets I have told, If you should them too rigid hold; T'attempt the Change would be but vain, The Conquest not being worth the pain: With those I'le other Nymphs persue, Cloris too much to lose Time and You. Love without Flattery. Admit, thou Darling of mine Eyes, I serve some Idol lately fram'd; That underneath a false disguise, Our true Loves might the less be fam'd: Canst thou that know'st my Heart suppose I fall from Thee to worship Those. Remember Dear how loth and slow I was to cast a Look or Smile; Or on Love, Lines to misbestow, Till thou hadst chang'd both Face and Stile: And art thou now affraid to see That Mask put on thou mad'st for mee. I cannot call these Childish fears That come from Love, much less from Thee; But wash away with frequent Tears That Counterfeit Apostacie: And henceforth kneel to ne'r a Shrine, To blind the World, but only Thine. The Crafty Lover. No more will I contemplate Love, Nor yet implore the Pow'rs above To cast their Influence on a Mind That can profess, and not be Kind. If good Examples will not do, I must decline the Practice too. My Mistress I'le no more admire, Her Beauty or her Love desire; Though in proportion both agree, When neither doth reflect on me: I may without a guilty thought Esteem those faculties from nought. Let those who love to spend their days In speaking Women, or their praise; Apply their Virtue to their use, As if 'twere real such abuse: I can but scorn, 'twill never take; I honour Virtue for its sake. I will no longer sacrifice To such unsacred Miseries, Nor yet contribute to a pow'r Exacts Obedience ev'ry hour: No no, my thoughts are too too free To fancy Her that Loves not me. Love in a Riddle. She that would not, I would chuse She that would not, I would chuse; She which would, I would refuse: Venus could my Mind but Tame, but not satisfie the same. Inticements offer'd I despise; and deny'd, I slightly prize: I would neither glut my mind, nor yet too much torment find. Thrice girt Diana do not take me, nor Venus naked, Joyful make me: The first no pleasure hath to Joy me, and the last enough to Cloy me. But a Crafty Lass I'de have, that will grant the Love I crave; and Joyn at once in one these two, I will, and yet I will not doe. Cassandra in Mourning. [I] Awake my Lute, arise my String, And to my sad Cassandra sing; like the old Poets, when the Moon Had put her Sable Mourning on, Aloud they sounded with a merry strain, Until her brightness was restor'd again. II Too well I know from whence proceeds Thy wearing of these Mourning weeds; In cruel flames for thee I burn, And thou for me do'st therefore mourn. So sits a glorious Godess in the Skies, Clouded i'th' Smoak of her own Sacrifice. III Wear other Virgins what they will! Cassandra loves her Mourning still: Thus the milky way so white Is never seen but in the Night; The Sun himself, although so bright he seem, Is black as are the Moors that worship him IV But tell me, thou deformed Cloud, How dar'st thou such a Body shroud? So Satyres with black hideous Face Of old did lovely Nimphs embrace: That mourning e're should hide such glorious Maids Thus Deities of old did live in shades. V Her Words are Oracles, and come (Like those) from out some dark'ned room: And her Breath proves that Spices do Only in Scorched Countries grow: If she but speak, an Indian she appears; Though all o're black, at Lips She Jewels wears. VI Methinks I now do Venus spy As she in Vulcan's arms did lye; Such is Cassandra and her Shroud: She looks like Snow within a Cloud: Melt then, and yield! throw off thy mourning Pall! Thou never can'st look white, until thou Fall. The Desparing Lover. [I] Cruel CÃ¦lia, did you know, Or at the least, but think my Woe, Your fairer Mind Would prove So kind, that ev'ry Passion then would move To pity, where you cannot love. II Could a Sigh, a Tear, a Grone, Things pale Passion feeds upon; A Midnight Grove, Place fit for Love: Could these but enter in your thought, Youl'd then confess Love dearly sought. III Cruel Fairest, there you sit As unconcern'd, as if my Wit To Mirth did move, Not to plead Love: You'r like the Deer, which list'ning stand To hear me Play, but slight the Hand. IV Fairest, like them, you admire The Musick, but neglect the Fire, The Air that beats And gives me heat: To tell you, Cruel Beauty, you Have out-done Him that worships You. Cloris Yielding. Will Cloris cast her Sun-bright Eye, Upon so mean a Swain as I? Can she affect my Oaten Reed, Or stoop to wear my Shepherds Weed. What Rural Sport can I devise To please her Ears, to please her Eyes; Fair Cloris sees, fair Cloris hears, With Angels Eyes, and Angels Ears. On a Crowned Heart. Thou sent'st to me a Heart was Crown'd Thou sent'st to me a Heart was Crown'd, I thought it had been Thine; but when I saw it had a Wound, I knew that Heart was mine. A Bounty of a strange conceit, to send mine Own to me; and send it in a worse estate than it was sent to Thee. The Heart I sent, it had no stain, but was entirely sound; yet thou hast sent it back again sick of a deadly wound. O Heav'ns! How wouldst thou use a Heart that should Rebellious be, as thus to slay Him with a Dart that ever honour'd Thee. Loves Enquiry. [1] Yes, I could Love, could I but find A Mistress fitting to my mind; Who neither Pride nor Gold could move To buy her Beauty, sell her Love: Were Neat, yet car'd not to be Fine; And love me for my self, not mine: Not Lady proud, nor City coy; But full of freedom, full of joy. 2 Not wise enough to rule a State, Nor so much Fool to be laugh'd at; Nor Childish young, nor Beldam old, Not Fiery hot, nor Icy cold; Not richly Proud, nor basely Poor; Not Chast, yet no reputed Whore. If such a one I chance to find I have a Mistress to my mind. The Prudent Lover. [1] Not that I wish my Mistress Or more, or less than what She is, Write I these Lines, for 'tis too late, Rules to prescribe unto my Fate. 2 But as the tender Stomachs call For choice of Meats, yet brook not all; So queasie Love may here impart What Mistress 'tis best takes the Heart. 3 First, I would have her richly spread With Natures Blossom, White and Red; For flaming heat will quickly dye, Where is no Jewel for the Eye. 4 Yet this alone will never win, Unless some Treasure be within; For where the Spoil's not worth the Prey, Men raise the Siege and March away. 5 I care not much if she be proud, A little pride may be allow'd; The amorous Youth will pray and prate Too freely, where he finds no state. 6 Then would I have her full of wit, So she knows how to huswife it; For she whose insolence will dare To cry her Wit, will shew her ware. 7 Last, I would have her Loving be, (Mistake me not) to none but me; She that loves one, and loves one more, She'le love a Kingdom o're and o're. The Humorous Lover. [1] Well well, 'tis true, I now am faln in Love, and 'tis with you: And now I plainly see whilst Y'are enthron'd by me above, You All your arts and pow'rs improve To tyrant over me, And make my flames th'incentives of your scorn, Whilst you rejoyce and feast your eyes To see me quite forlorn. 2 But yet be wise, And don't believe that I did think your Eyes More bright than the Stars can be; Or that your Face Angels out-vies In their Celestial Liveries: 'Twas all but Poetry: I could have said as much by any She; You are not Beautious of your Self, But are made so by Me. 3 Though we (like Fools) Fathom the Earth, and drain the Schools For Names t'express you by; Out-rant the loudest Hyperboles To dub you Saints and Deities By Cupid's Heraldry: We know y'are flesh and blood as well as Men, And when we please can Mortalize, And make you so agen. 4 Yet since my Fate Hath drawn me to that Sin which I did hate, I'le not my labour lose, But will love on, as I begin, To th'purpose, now my hand is in, Spight of the Art you use; And let you know the world is not so bare, There's things enough to love besides Such Toys as Ladies are. 5 I love good Wine, I love my Book, and Muse, nay all the Nine; I love my real Friend; I love my Horse; and could I chuse One that would not my Love abuse, To Her my Love should bend: I will love those that laugh, and those that sing, And scorn to pine away my self For any Female thing. Lukewarmness in Love. [I] No more, no more, Fond Love, give o're; Dally no more with me: Strike home and bold, Be hot or cold, Or leave thy Deitie. II In Love Lukewarm, Will do more harm, Then can Feavers heat: Cold cannot kill, So soon as will A fainting dying Sweat. III I cannot tell, When Sick or Well Physick or Poyson give: Still in my Grief, There's no Relief, Oh let me Dye or Live! IV If I must be Thy Votarie, Be thou my Friend or Foe: If thou wilt have Me be thy Slave, Hold fast, or let me go. The Triumphs of Death. The Glories of our Birth and State Are shadows, not substantial things The Glories of our Birth and State Are shadows, not substantial things; There is no Armor 'gainst our fate; Death layes his Icy-hand on Kings: Scepters and Crowns must tumble down, And in the Dust be equall layd With the poor crooked Syth &amp; Spade. Some men with Swords may reap the Field, And plant fresh Lawrels where they kill'd; But their strong Nerves at last must yield, They tame but one another still. Early or late they bend to fate, And must give up their murm'ring breath While the pale Captive creeps to Death. The Garland withers on your brow, Then boast no more your mighty deeds: Upon Death's purple Altar now, See where the Victor Victim bleeds. All heads must come to the cold Tomb, Only the Actions of the Just Smell sweet, and Blossom in the Dust. Venus Hue and Cry after Cupid. [1] Beauties, have ye seen a Toy, Called, Love a little Boy; Almost Naked, Wanton, Blind, Cruel; now and then as kind: If he be amongst you, say, He is Venus run away. 2 She that will now but now discover Where this Winged-wag doth hover, Shall to night receive a kiss, How, or where her self would wish; But who brings him to his Mother, Shall have that kiss and another. 3 Marks he hath about him plenty, You shall know him among twenty, All his body is a fre, And his breath a flame entire, That brings shot (like light'ning) in Wounds the Heart but not the skin. 4 Wings he hath which though you clip, He will leap from Lip to Lip; Over Liver, Lips, and Heart, But ne're stay in any part: And if by chance his Arrow misies, He will shoot himself in kisses. 5 He doth bear a golden Bow, And a Quiver hanging low, Full of Arrows that out-brave Dians Shafts; what if he have Any head more sharp than other? With that kiss he strikes his mother. 6 Still the fairest are his fuel, When his daies are to be cruel, Lovers hearts are all his food, And his Bath's their warmest Blood: Nought but wounds his hands doth season, And he hates none like to reason. 7 Trust him not, his words, though sweet, Seldom with his heart do meet; All his practice is deceit, Ev'ry gift is a bait, Not a kiss but poyson bears, And most treason in his tears. 8 Idle minutes are his reign, Them the stragler makes his gain, By presenting Maids with toys, And would have ye think 'em toys; 'Tis the ambition of the Else, To have all childish as himself. 9 If by these you please to know him, Beauties be not nice, but show him, Though you had a will to hide him, Now I hope ye'le not abide him: Since ye hear his falser play, And that he's Venus Ran-away. Youths Vanity. Though you are young, and I am old: Though your veyns hot, and my blood cold: Though Youth is Moist, and Age is Dry; Yet Embers live when Flames do die. The tender Graff is Easily broke, But who shall shake the sturdy Oke? You are more Fresh and Fair than I; Yet Stubs do live when Flowers do die. Thou that thy Youth dost vainly boast, Know Buds are sooner nipt with Frost: Think that thy Fortune still doth cry, Fond Youth, To morrow thou must die. And if to morrow thou Dy'st not, To Die ere long will be thou lot: Though thou of late didst Age deny, Must welcome Death, and learn to Die. Cupid Embraced. I never knew what Cupid meant, Nor what his Arrows were; And yet I have been Discontent, And shed many a Tear. I have seen a Woman has been Fair, And yet could never be Caught in the Net-work of her Hair, Or Faces Pagentry. But then considering how in her Virtue and Sweetness dwelt, I wondred not at any stir, That in my Heart I felt. I wondred that my stubborn Heart, That hath so long held out, Should, by the piercing of his Dart Unseen, be brought about. But Cupid with a reverend Knee I worship now, like those That rank him as a Deity; And Thank him for my Blows. On a Stolen Heart. What conscience say is it in Thee What conscience say is it in Thee, when I'ave a Heart but one to take away that Heart from me, and so to leave me none: For shame or pity now encline to act a loving part, either to send me kindly Thine, or give me back my Heart: Covet not both: But if thou dost resolve to part with neither, why yet to shew that thou art Just, take Me take Me and Mine take Me and Mine together. A Despairing Lover. Farewell Despairing Hopes, I'le love no more Farewell Despairing Hopes, I'le love no more; of Death I'm not afraid, my poor Heart is betray'd; She that disdains my Love, must I adore. Farewell, Farewell despairing Hopes, I'le live no more, I'le love no more. To crave from Cruel Eyes compassion, 'tis in vain; and with Laments and Cryes to sob out Tears, the witness of my pain. No Death shall cure my Sore: Farewell, Farewell Despairing Hopes, I'le live no more to see when I complain a Cruel Soul disdain, that to my grief I love, when Her no tears can move, but rival tears: Ah! 'twas ne're heard before. Farewell, Farewell Despairing Hopes, I'le live no more: Ne're flatter more my sense with sweet and courteous Breath, 'twixt outrage and offence I am condemn'd, I am condemn'd to Death. No more on Joys I dote, but with a doleful Note my Life and Death deplore. Farewell, Farewell Despairing Hopes, I'le live no more, Ile live no more. To his Theora. If still Theora you wear this disguise of Scorn up on your Eyes If still Theora you wear this disguise of Scorn up on your Eyes, and suffer not one smile approve th'obedience of my Immortal Love: Two Hells at once my Soul must try; my own Affections, and your Cruelty. But if some kinder Aspect shall encline your Heart to pity mine, I'le breath such Joys no envious Fate shall blast with a surprize, or Time translate. Strange Providence! that Lovers still find Lips to Kiss as well as Eyes to Kill. Thus have you seen Waves chac'd by th'troubled Ayr, move nothing but Despair, till some more friendly Winds do stay their Murmers, and lead up a Beautious day. Great penances do make us prize (with greater sense) our hopes of Paradice. To a Stream. Cleer Stream, who dost with equal pace both thy self fly Cleer Stream, who dost with equal pace both thy self fly, and thy self chace; forbear a while to flow, and listen to my woe: Then go and tell the Sea that all his Brine is fresh, compar'd to mine. Inform him that the gentle Dame who was the life of all my flame, i'th' glory of her bud hath past the dismal flood: Death by this only stroke Triumphs above the gentle pow'r of Love. Alas, Alas! I must give o're, my sighs will let me add no more. Go on, cleer Stream, but rest no more my troubled breast: And if my sad Complaint hath made thee stay, ther's Tears ther's Tears to mend thy way. Loves Triumph. Ah, ah, mighty Love! what pow'r unknown Ah, ah, mighty Love! what pow'r unknown hast thou now us'd more then thy own? It was thy Conduct and Designe, but not thy Pow'r that vanquish'd mine: As a great Captain to his Name of ev'ry Conquest joyns the Fame; though 'twas not by his Power got, but Armies by his Conduct brought: So when thou could'st not do't alone, thou lead'st his troops of Virtues on And I now feel by my surprize, thou hast not only Darts; not only Darts, but Eyes. Just god, now take again thy Arms, and rally all I have of Charms: What Pow'r and Conduct cannot doe, make his Belief contribute too: So when the Earth some promise shows that she does yet more Wealth enclose: Believing men search her rich Veins, and crown their hopes with unknown gains: May he but at the first incline to Love, then by my Faith and Time, his Justice after the surprize shall be more fetter'd, shall be more fetter'd than his Eyes. On the soft and gentle Motions of Eudora. Strike, Strike sweet Licoris Strike, Strike sweet Licoris, strike th'harmonious Lute; but with a stroke so gentle as may sute the silent glyding of the Hours, or the yet calmer growth of Flow'rs, th'ascending or the falling dew, which none can see, yet all find true. For thus alone can be shown how downy, how smooth Eudora doth move. How Ev'n her Actions appear: the Air of her Face of a gentler grace than these that do stroke the Ear: Her address so sweet, so becoming meet, that 'tis not the Loud, though Melodious string, can shew forth so soft, so noysless a thing. This, O this to express from thy Hand must fall than Musicks self something more Musicall. The Dying Lover. O fairest Lights! O fairest Lights! whose cleer Aspect taught me Loves lesson at first sight, when on me those rays reflect, which awe my Love to deep respect; whilest Joy and Grief whilest Joy and Grief dispute their Rights: Ah how I die, Ah how I die, crown'd crown'd with Delight. An old Knight to a young Lady. Madam, your Beauty (I confess) May our young Gallants wound or bless; But cannot warm my frozen Heart, Not capable of Joy or Smart; 'Cause neither Wit, nor Looks, nor Kindness Can make Young a Superannuated man. Those sparks that every minute fly From your bright Eyes, do falling die; Not kindle flames, as heretofore, Because old I can love no more: Beauty on wither'd Hearts no Trophy gains; For Tinder over us'd, no Fire retains. If you'l indure to be admir'd By an old Dotard new Inspir'd, You may enjoy the Quintessence Of my past Loves without Expence: For I can wait, and prate, I thank my Fate, I can do all, but no new Fire Create. Cupid's Power. Disdain not, Fair one, since we know Your Heart's a Mark for Cupid's Bow: The Scorns you cast at Love will turn Like Lightning back, and make you burn. Let those whom Age hath set aside To Court the Grave for their next Bride; Or let the frigid Matron say They will no god of Love obey. But you who want nor Youth, nor Fire To kindle Altus of Desire; I doubt not but ere long you'l be Loves Proselite as well as we. To a Friend who desired no more then to admire the Mind, and the Beauty of Silvia. [I] Though Silvas Eyes a flame could raise More fit for wonder then for praise; And though her wit were cleer and high, That 'twere resistless as her Eye; Yet without Love she still shall find I'm deaf to one, to the other blind. II Those Fools that think Beauty can prove A cause sufficient for their Love, I wish they never may have more, To try how Looks can cure their sore: 'Tis such the Sex so high have set, They take it not for gift, but debt. III If Love were unto Sight confin'd, The god of it would not be Blind; Nor would the pleasure of it be So often in obscuritie: No, to know Joys each sense hath right, Equal at least to that of Sight. IV The gods, who knew the noblest part In Love, sought not the Mind, but Heart; And when hurt by the winged Boy, What they admir'd, they did enjoy; Knowing a Kindness Love could prove The hope, reward, and cure of Love. V I'le rather my Affections keep For Nimphs only injoy'd in sleep, Then cast away an houre of Care On any, 'cause she's only fair: Nay, Sleep more pleasing Dreams do move Then are your waking ones of Love. VI The Frensie's less love to endure, Then after to decline the Cure; Yet you do both, aiming no higher Then for to see, and to admire, An Idol you'l not only frame, But you will too adore the same. VII Had therein Silvia nothing shin'd But the unseen charms of her Mind, You would have had the like esteem For her that I have still for them: If flesh and blood your flame inspire, Then make those only your desire. VIII And Friend, that you may cleerly prove 'Tis not her Mind alone you love; Let her 'twixt us her self impart, Give you her Mind, and me her Heart: As little cause then you will find As I do now, to love her Mind. The Earl to the Countess of Carbery. You ask, my Dear, if I be well; Feel thine own pulse, and that will tell: Vain is all other Art That beats the Temper of my Heart; If I may call that mine Is so entirely thine. Dearest, then tell me how I doe; For both my Health and Heart's in You. When first I view'd thee, I did spy Thy Soul stand beck'ning in thine Eye; My Heart knew what it meant, And at the very first Kiss went, Two Balls of Wax so run When melted into one: Mix'd now with thine, my Heart now lies, And much Loves Riddle as thy Prize. For, since I can't pretend to have That Heart, which I so freely gave; Yet now 'tis Mine the more, Because 'tis thine, then 'twas before: Death will unriddle this; For when thou 'rt call'd to bliss, He needs not throw at me his Dart, 'Cause piercing thine, he kills my Heart. Constancy in Love. Love me no more, or else with scorn despise All other Loves, though made your Sacrifice: A Prince for Rivall should not share a bliss, Till Fate decide it either mine or his. In Love and Courage, Titles has no Claim, Merit and Virtue give the highest Name. Let then thy Cupid soar on Honours wings, Thy Constancy and Love appear like Twins; So shall thy Mind excell thy Shape much more Than thou all other Beauties didst before, Crowning with glory both thy self and me, And when thou dy'st be thought a Deitie. Cupid Discovered. Cupid's no god, a wanton Childe, His Arts are weak, his Pow'rs are milde; No active heat or nobler fire Feathers his Arrows with Desire: 'Tis not his Bow or Shaft, 'tis Venus Eye Makes him ador'd, and crowns his Deitie. Each Amorous glance creates this Fire, As Coyns dulls and chills Desire; 'Tis then the Face and Eyes we see, Not the fond Boys Artillerie: 'Tis the Consentive nimbler Sense creates Love's subtler piercing Fires, not the Fates. Inconstancy in Love. [I] If thou wilt know the reason why I hate thee now once held so Deer, Upon thy Glass but cast thine Eye, And thou shalt find it written there; For as in that thou mayst survey Thy fair, false Eyes, and lovely Face; So nothing in thy Glass will stay, When thou art parted from the place. II So when my Love did first pretend, Me thought I saw my self in thee; And therefore chose thee for a Friend, That ought Anothers self to be: All Vows and Oaths I made to Love Thou shouldst repeat when I had done, And by a sweet reflection prove We were (though seeming Two) but One. III But when I absent was a while, And others came to look in thee, As they would laugh, so wouldst thou smile, And no impression left of mee: Now, though to have a Friend were best, That might reflect thoughts as they pass, My Mind shall rather go ill-drest Than mind it self by such a Glass. For a Bass. When I taste my Goblet deep When I taste my Goblet deep, all my Cares are rock'd a Sleep: Then I'm CrÅsus, Lord of th'Earth, Singing Odes of Wit and Mirth; and with Ivy Garlands crown'd, I can kick the Globe round, round. Others Fight, but let me Drink; Boy, my Goblet fill to the brink; for when I lay down my head, better to be Drunk, better to be Drunk, Dead Drunk, than Dead. The Greek's Song. The thirsty Earth sucks up the Rain, and drinks, and gapes for Drink again: The Plants suck in the Earth, and are with constant drinking fresh and fair: The Sea it self which one would think should have but little need to drink, drinks ten thousand Rivers up, so fill'd they overflow flow the Cup: The busie Sun, and one would guess by's drunken fiery Face no less, drinks up the Sea; and when that's done, the Moon and Stars drinkes up the Sun. They Drink and Dance, by their own light, they Drink and Revel all the Night. Nothing in Nature's sober found, but an Eternal Health goes Round. CHORUS. Fill up the Bowl then, fill it high; Fill all the Glasses there; for why should ev'ry Creature drink but I? Why Man of Mortals, tell me why? CÃ¦lia's Complaint. [I] Poor CÃ¦lia once was very fair, A quick bewitching Eye she had; Most neatly look'd her braided Hair, Her dainty Cheek would make you mad; Upon her Lips did all the Graces play And on her Breasts ten Thousand Thousand Cupids lay. II Then many a doting Lover came From Seventeen till Twenty one; Each told her of his mighty slame, But She, forsooth, affected none: One was not Handsome, th'other was not Fine; This of Tobacco smelt, and that of Wine. III But t'other day it was my fate To walk along that way alone; I saw no Coach before her gate, But at her dore I heard her moan: She dropt a Tear, and sighing seem'd to say, Young Ladies, Marry, Marry while you may. Here Endeth the Ayres for One Voice to the Theorbo or Bass Viol. SELECT DIALOGUES To Sing to the LUTE or VIOL. [Sweet Lovely Nimph] A Dialogue. Shepherd and Nimph. Shepherd. Sweet Lovely Nimph! whose Eyes do move me above all other Swains to Love thee. Nimph. Shepherd, you feign; and I know there is no flattering Swain like you. Shepherd. O fair one! do not wrong me so; for if ever Shepherd Lov'd, I doe. Nimph. May I believe thy Vows unfained. Shep. Or may I die by you disdained. CHORUS. Then let us Joy, then let us Joy each others Love, and strive and strive who shall most Constant prove. [Why Sighs thou Shepherd] A Dialogue. Nimph and Shepherd Nimph. Why sighs thou, Shepherd? This passion is not common: Is't for thy Kids or Lambkins? Shepherd. For a Woman. Nimph. How fair is She that on so sage a brow prints Lowring Looks? Shep. Just such a toy as thou. Nimph. Is she a Maid? Shepherd. What man can Answer that? Nimph. Or Widow? Shep. No. Nimph. What then? Shepherd. I know not what: Saint-like she looks, a Syren if she sing; her Eyes are Stones; her Mind, her Mind is ev'ry thing. Nimph. If she be fickle, Shepherd leave to wooe, and fancy Me. Shep. No, no, Thou art Woman too. Nimph. But I am Constant. Shepherd. Then thou art not Fair. Nimph. Bright as the morning. Sheph. Wav'ring as the Air. Nimph. What grows upon this Cheek? Shepherd. A pure Carnation. Nimph. Come taste a Kiss. Shep. O sweet, O sweet, O sweet temptation! Chorus. O sweet, O sweet temptation! CHORUS. Ah Love! how canst thou ever lose the Field? where Cupid lays the Siege the Town must yield: He warms the chiller blood, with glowing fire, and thaws the Icy frost of cold Desire. The Icy frost of cold Desire. [Hast you Nimphs] A Dialogue. Nimph and Shepherd Nimph. Hast you Nimphs, make hast away, for this is Pan's high Holiday: Look, O look, the Swains appear. Shepherd. Fly not, Fly not, all are Lovers here, then do not fear. Nimph. Say, should we trust, mens Oaths are but words writ in Dust: O they can fain, cry they are slain; but when we yield, they scorn again. Shepherd. No, no, not so, we Men are Kind, but Women Cruel Cruel as the Wind: Upon the wide Sea they seldome Save, but bring new woes with a new Wave. CHORUS. Nimphs and Swains make hast away make away; For this is Pan's high Holiday, For this is Pan's high Holiday. A Dialogue. Occasioned by the Death of the young Lord Hastings, who dyed some few days before he was to have been Married to Sir Theodore Meihern's Daughter, in June, 1649. Charon and Eucosmia. Eucosmia. Charon, O Charon, draw thy Boat to th'Shore; and to thy many, take in one soul more. Charon. Who calls, who calls? Eucosmia. One o'rewhelm'd with ruth; have pity either on my tears or youth, and take me in a Virgin in distress, but first cast off thy wonted churlishness. Charon. I'd be as gentle as that Aire with yields a breath of Balm along the Elizium fields. Tell what thou art. Eucosmia. A Maid that had a Lover, then which thy self ne're wafted Sweeter over: He was. Char. Say what. Eucosmia. Ah me! my woes are deep. Char. Prethee relate, while I give ear, and weep. Eucos. Hastings, Hastings, was his name, and that one name has in it all good that is, and ever was: He was my Life, my Joy, my Love; but dy'd some houres before I should have been his Bride. CHORUS. Thus, thus the Gods celestial still decree to humane joys, contingent miserie. Eucosmia. The hallow'd Tapers all prepared were, and Hymen call'd to bless the Rites. Charon. Stop there. Eucosmia. Great are my woes. Charon. And great must that grief be which makes grim Charon here to pity thee: But now come in. Eucosm. More I would yet relate. Charon. I cannot stay, more Souls for wafting wait, and I must hence. Eucosm. Yet let me thus much know departing hence, where good and bad Souls go? Charon. Those Souls which ne're were drench'd in pleasures streams, the fields of Pluto are reserv'd for them, where drest with garlands there they walk the ground, whose blessed Youth with endless flowers is crown'd: But such as have been drown'd in the wilde sea, for those is kept the gulph of Hecate; where with their own contagion they are fed; and there do punish, and are punished. This know, the rest of thy sad story tell, when on the flood that nine times circles Hell. CHORUS. We, we sail from hence, we sail from hence to visit mortals never, but there to live where love shal last, where love shal last for ever. [And being set upon th'Elizium Shore, we'l sing such woes, such woes; we'l sing such woes, such woes, as ne'r came there before.] A Dialogue. Charon and Amintor. Amintor. Charon, O Charon! Hear a wretch opprest, and waft me ore to Shades of endless rest. Charon. What art that calls so loud? Amintor. One full of care. Charon. How cam'st thou here? Amintor. Through Shades of deep Despair. Charon. Why, from the Common path cam'st thou astray? Amintor. Grief was my Guide, and Love taught Grief the way. Charon. Where is my Pass? Amin. No Pass but Tears I have; to waft me o're is all the Pass I crave. Char. Away, fond man, avoyd the Shades beneath; Here cometh none, but through the gates of Death. Amintor. My woes are worse than Death. Charon. What's that to me? I never pity humane miserie. Amintor. Hard hearted wretch. Charon. Get hence, get hence; thou dost me wrong. Amintor. In thy despite, in thy despite I'le pass e're it be long. Char. Away away away away; Go see if Time can Thee recover: If not, If not, bring Deaths black Seal, I'le waft thee over. Amintor. Grief, rain a Sea of Tears for me to sail: And Love thy Quiver lend a Boat to make, the storm of sighs with speed will so prevail, that spite of Death we'll fiery o're the Lake. CHORUS. And being set upon th'Elizium Shore, we'l sing such woes, such woes; we'l sing such woes, such woes, as ne'r came there before. [This Mossy Bank they prest] A Dialogue. Shepherd and Nimph. Shepherd. This Mossy-Bank they prest Nimph. That Aged Oke did canopy the happy Pair all Night from the dark Air. CHORUS. Here let us sit and sing the words they spoke, when the Day breaking their Embraces broke. Shepherd. See Love the blushes of the Morn appear, and now she hangs her pearly store robb'd from the Eastern Shore, i'th Cowslips-bell and Roses ear: Sweet, I must stay no longer here. Nimph. Those streaks of doubtful light usher not Day, but show my Sun must set, no Morn' shall shine till thy return, the yellow Planet, and the grey Dawn shall attend the on thy way. Sheph. If thine Eyes gild my paths, they may forbear their useless shine. Nimph. My tears will quite extinguish their faint light. Shep. Those drops will make their beams more clear: Loves flames will shine on ev'ry tear. CHORUS. They wept and kist, and from their Lips and Eyes in a mix dew of briny Sweet their Joys and Sorrows meet: But she cryes out, Lips and Eyes in a mixt dew of briny Sweet their Joys their Joys and Sorrows meet: But she cryes out, Nimph. Shepherd arise, the Sun betrays us else to Spies. Shepherd. The winged hours fly fast whilst we embrace; but when we want their help to meet, move with leaden feet. Nimph. Then let us pinion Time, and chace the day for ever from this place. Sheph. Heark! Nimph. Ah me! Stay. Shep. For ever. Nimph. No no, arise, we must be gone. Shepherd. My Nest of Spice. Nimph. My Soul. My Paradice. CHORUS. Neither could say Farewell, but through their Eyes Grief interrupted Speech, Grief interrupted Speech, with Tears supplies. [Shepherd well met] A Dialogue. [Two Trebles or Tenors.] Shepherd and Nimph. Nimph. Shepherd well met, I prethee tell, what makes thy blubber'd Eyes to swell? what sadness in thy looks do dwell? Shepherd. My woe's too great for to relate. Nimph. Good Shepherd tell me what ill fate hath brought thee to this doleful state? Thy Dancing bore away the bell, thy cheerful Pipe did all excell: Why hast thou broke it, Shepherd tell? Shepherd. Ah! do not ask; for my sick heart panteth with such Infectious smart, thou canst not know but bear a part. Nimph. A part I'le bear most willingly. CHORUS. Griefs jointly borne are eas'd thereby: Griefs jointly borne are eas'd thereby. Shepherd. Since th'art in love with Miserie, know Clorin's dead: Now weep thy fill, weep thy fill; now weep thy fill, weep thy fill. Nimph. Indeed I shall. CHORUS. This story will all tears from our swolne Eyes distill, from our swolne Eyes distill, from our swoln Eyes distill: our tears our sighs are all in vain. Nimph, Can they not call her back again. Shep. No, with the gods, with the gods, with the gods she must remain. CHORUS. Cease mourning then, she shines above, she shines above; 'tis not lamenting, 'tis not lamenting can remove, can remove, can remove or lessen Grief; but shew our Love, but shew our Love, but shew our Love.

That if the Old Philosophy were true, What his Spent Fires could not, thy Lyre would doe; Make Old Time Vigorous still, confessing more Thy Fam'd Layes now, then all his Beams before. Nature her self should thus thy Learn'd Aid crave, From whose Stockt Brain all that we have, we have. Whose Yearly Spendings Shew, not wast thy Store, Who after Numerous Births can yet give more. Still whole, Unspent that when the Year doth cease (As Ãgypt Nile's) We wait thy Next Encrease. Then High, and Rich as He Thou Flow'st: We see What all else cannot, and what Thou can'st be. And till We pass the Spheres, must still attend, To know what Height Musick hath yet t'ascend. For Thou Grasp'st all; We the rude Matter give, Thou into Verse breath'st Soul, and bid'st it Live. Endu'st it with that Plastick Pow'r to Spring What Thou would'st have it, This, That, any Thing. Dost in thy Mould our Wit new Shape, and Cast, Giv'st it New Salt, the Haut Goust, and Rich Tast. It Lives with us, doth Flourish in thy Ayre, Born from our Brains, but Educated there. Things that from us flat and insipid flow, Voic'd once by Thee, straight into Raptures grow. When from her Mine Invention Fancy brings, Thy composition a New Fancy springs. Thus whiles all comes Exact, Watch'd, Humour'd, Hit, Thy Ayre's Ingenuous, and makes Musick Wit. Nor dost Thou, Narrow, only dwell among The Easie Rhimes of thine own Time, and Tongue: Thy Reaching, Vent'ring Soul doth Wit pursue Setting of Anacreon's Odes.Thorough all Languages, and all times too; That which some Twenty Ages since first grew, Thou Retriv'st now, and we admire as New. Compar'st and tri'st how th'Ancient Pipes will sound, Mak'st Old wit stronger by the New Rebound: Who are, and who are not, Obliged bee, Poet, and Poetry it self to thee. What She suggests comes a mishapen Birth, Till Thou step'st in, and thence strik'st Musick forth. Admired Lavves! thy Happy Ayres have knit Eternall Leagues 'twixt Harmony and wit: Which none but those thy Richer Robes will know, When she keeps State, or would in Triumph go. We drink in Thousand Pleasures from One Song, Which Charms us all, the Learned and the Throng. We are Transported, Lost! thy Notes betray, Drop on the Sense, and melt us quite away. And when we're Extasy'd, Expiring, then Thy Next Note Wooes, and calls us back agen. At once Thou Steal'st, and can'st invade us too, Straight Rouze those pow'rs which were all Lodg'd but now. Thou like some Mighty Monarch dost controul, Dispence, Rule, Work, and Reign o're all the Soul. Thou shoot'st New Beings: For we are no more, When we hear Thee, that which we were before. But as that Begger who in's Raving Fits, Got Crowns and Scepters when he lost his Wits; Cur'd, and himself again, Griev'd straight to pass Into that poor, shrunk Nothing that he was: So when thy Strains Feast our low Fancies high, We Trample Earth, and Mounting, Knock the Sky. But when They cease, All Mourn that we have lost Those Tow'ring Thoughts our then Rapt Souls engross'd. Thou, like a Generall Influence, Sway'st in All, Dost Touch the Mind, and her glad Motions call. Whiles We our Constant Acclamations bring To the still New Choice Graces that You Sing. Thus dost Thou Govern all (Harmonious Soul!) And through the Great whole Orbe of Musick Rowl. Break'st from thy Self, Scatt'ring Day every where, Not leaving one Dark Part in all the Sphere. All Native, Genuine, and Unborrow'd streams, The Sun and Lavves know not to Owe their Beams. Who on the Wings Thou Imp'st Verse with, hast Spread Thy Fame far as the Roman Eagle fled. Those Judging Few who can Compare, admire, And find Thine Match the best Italian Lyre; Thou still Stand'st High; thy Rules so True, Severe! All by thy Card, Thou by thine Own dost steere. Like the First Mover, Uncontrol'd dost Move, (He which makes peace, Turnes, and Tunes all Above.) Even, and Just as he: whiles all doth shew What Harmony, that is, what Lavves can do. And such! so Full! so Mighty is thy Vein, Thou hast scarce Thought when all flowes from thy Brain. As Things first met in the Creation, All, Doth of it self straight into Concord fall; Which issuing free us Springing Light from th'Morn, Shews Thee Musician, like the Poet Born. You Two do Wing it still in Noble Flights, Strive, Stretch, Mount, Soar, Match, and vie Heights with Heights. And we the while Admiring, doubtfull stand, Which shall at last the Bravest Place command. With Words and Ayres our Ears are doubly fed, What e're thou set'st is at once Sung and sed. Thou dost still Apt, Complying Notes dispense, True to the Words, but truer to the sense. The Tunes Rehearse: no Crowd of Graces throng, And Justle all the Words out of the Song. But are so scatter'd here, and there, so sowne, It hath them all, and yet is vex'd with None. Thy Jewels with such Art are plac'd and worne, That they ne'r Cloud the part they should adorne. Thus doth thy Equall Skill not more delight, To do thy Self, then do the Poet Right. Thou Maim'st not him to come forth Conquerour, Thine, Steales none o'th Bullion when it adds the Coin. No tedious, long, deviding tricks betray His sense; and vapour all his Words away. Yet when a Word comes fit t'Espouze a Grace. Thou marri'st both, and know'st the Rites, and place. Then Fancy humour'd shews the guilded Beam, That Glitt'ring Plays, and Quavers on the stream. Both Close, and Kind as Life and Spirit sit, Thy Ayres still Quicken, never stifle Wit. And as One Dram of Gold can ne'r be lost, Though in a Thousand Fires Try'd, Vex'd, and Forc'd, Dissolv'd, mix'd with all Elements, we see, Expans'd to Infinite, what was will Bee. So with the same Entireness Numbers do, From all thy Artfull Compositions flow. Which though through all thy Flats and Sharps express'd In thy Rich Notes, and various humours dress'd. Are still the same: if any Change appear, Stamp'd now by Thee, they'r better than they were. Where Words, Sense, Tunes Embrace, so Kiss, Twist Hit, Thy whole Age hath not lost One Grain of Wit. Go on Great Master of thy Art! Strike dumb, And with thy Tones Calm the Tempestuous Drum. Tune, Recollect, Please, and reform us; Thine, Come at once Musick too, and Discipline. Let thy soft Notes invite us, slide, and Steal, Rock this Frow'rd Age, and with their Balsam Heal. Shew all the Miracles thy voice can do, Our Orpheus and our Ãsculapius too. And when these Revolutions make thy Shine Compleat, and Thou hast woave thy great Designe: Hush'd all our Noise, spread Calms made all serene, And with thy Ayres at last shut up the Scene: All Done, Thou shalt (though late, we hope) Remove, And change thy Musick here for that Above. Where thou shalt here how Saints their Anthems sing, And shalt thy Self another Anthem bring. Thou who did'st Tune the World, whiles Thou wert here, Shall take an Angels place, and Tune a Sphere. Horatio Moore. [The Ayres for One Voyce to Thearboe-Lute or Bass-Viol] Cloris landing at Berlington. See, see! my Chloris Amintor. See, see! my Chloris, my Chloris comes in yonder Bark: Blow gently winds, for if ye sink that Ark, you'l drown the world with tears, and at one breath, give to us all a universal death: Hark, hark how Arion on a Dolphin playes, to my sweet Sheepherdess his roundelayes: See how the Sirens flock to wait upon her, as Queen of Love, and they her Maids of honor. Behold, Great Neptune's risen from the deep with all his Tritons, and begins to sweep the rugged waves into a smoother form, not leaving one small wrinkle of a storm: Mark how the winds stand still, and on her gaze; See how her beauty doth the fish amaze; the Whales have begg'd this boon of wind and weather, that on their backs they may convey her hither; And see she Lands just like the rising Sun, that leaves the Brynie Lake when night is done: Fly, fly Amintor to thy Envi'd bliss, and let not th'Earth, rob thee of her greeting kiss. Constancy protested. [1] Oft have I swore, I'de love no more; Yet when I think on thee, Alass I cannot give it o're, But must thy captive be; So many sweets and graces dwel About thy lips and eyes, That whosoever once is caught Must ever be thy prize. 2 Sure thou hast got some cunning net Made by the god of Fire, That doth not only catch mens hearts But fixeth their desire. For I have laboured to get loose Some dozen years and more, And when I think to be releas'd I'me faster than before. 3 Then welcome sweet captivity, I see there's no relief, Yet though she steal my liberty, I'le honor still the theife And when I cannot hope to see Thee Mistris of my pain, My comfort is that I do love Where I am lov'd again. Counsel to a Maid. [1] Chloris, when e're you do intend To venture at a Bosome-friend, Be sure you know your Servant well, Before your liberty you fell; For Love's a feaver in young, or old, That's sometimes hot, and sometimes cold; And men you know when e're they please Can soon be sick of this disease. 2 Then wisely chuse a Friend that may Last for an age, not for a day; Who loves thee not for Lip or Eye, But from a mutual Simpathie: To such a Friend this heart ingage, For he will court the in old age, And kiss thy shallow, wrinkl'd brow, Whith as much Ioy, as he now. Love despis'd. [I] In love? Away, You do me wrong, I hope I ha' not liv'd so long Free from the treach'ry of your Eyes, Now to be caught and made a prize: No, Lady, 'tis not all your Art Can make me and my freedome part. II In Love! 'tis true, with Spanish wine, Or the French juice Incarnadine, But truly not with your sweet face, This dimple, or that hidden grace; Ther's far more sweetnesse in pure wine, Then in those lips or eyes of thine. III Your god you say can shoot so right Hee'l wound a heart i'th darkest night; Pray let him throw away a dart, And try if he can hit my heart: No Cupid, if I shall be thine, Turn Ganimed, and fill us wine. Come fil's a cup of Sherry, And let us be merry, There shall nought but pure wine, Make us love-sick or pine; Wee'l hug the cup and kiss it, Wee'l sigh when e're we miss it, For 'tis that that makes us jolly, And sing Hy trolly lolly. Hopelesse love cur'd by derision. [1] What? wilt thou pine, or fall away, Because thy Daphne says thee nay? Wilt cross thine arms, or willow wear, Because that Shee is so severe? Fye Shepherd, Fye, this must not bee, Thy Daphne then will laugh at thee. 2 No, if She needs will be unkind, On somewhat else divert thy mind: Go sport with wanton Amarillis, And dance with lovely nut-brown Phillis: For Love's a shadow will deny To follow thee, until thou sly. 3 Then Choridon, do not despair For Daphne, whom we all know fair; Let no proud Beauty on our Plains Destroy thy youth with her disdains: But if thou find her scorning thee, Think thus, She was not born for mee. A young Maids Resolution. [I] Goe young man, let my heart alone, 'Twil be a pris'ner unto none; Nor will I Cupids shackles wear, Since Lovers laws are so severe: Love is my slave, while I despise; But once content, hee'l tyrannise. II 'Tis onely Beauty you admire, And that's the object of Desire, Which by degrees burns to a flame, And hence Love first receiv'd its name. Then young man give me leave to doubt Since Love's a fire, and sires will out. Cupid no god. [I] I prethee Love take heed Or else I shall blaspheme, And swear that thy Great deity Is nothing but a dream. II How canst thou be a god When subtle womens hearts Are grown so wise To blind thine eyes And rob thee of thy darts. III See where a Lady stands With Quivers in her Eyes, And swears that shee Hath conquer'd thee, And sold thee for a prize. IV If thou be Womans prize, Alass, then what are wee Who borrow light From thy blind sight, And know not what we see. Inconstancy return'd. [I] Did I once say that thou wert fair, And swear thy breath perfum'd the air? Did I commit Idolatry, And court thee as a deity? Ah CÃ¦lia! sure then I was blind, Or else it was when thou wert kind. II Did I once beg a wanton kiss, And thought there was no higher bliss? Did I all other objects flye To live i'th sun-shine of thine eye? 'Tis true I did, but CÃ¦lia then Return'd as much to me agen. III Now CÃ¦lia's chang'd and so am I, Love feeds upon variety; My constant thoughts could never find The pleasures of a Fickle mind, Till thy example did invite My appetite to new delight. His Rivals danger. [I] Take heed bold Lover, do not look Upon my Chloris Eyes, For every dart is tipp'd with death That from her glances flyes. II Nor do not think to save thy self From danger, or from harmes, By any virtue in her smiles, Or other secret charmes. III Love hath commanded her to cure No other heart but mine, There is no hope that Shee can be So merciful to thine. IV For though her Eyes be Murderers, She hath reserv'd for me, A Balsam in her Coral lips That gives Eternitie. To his Platonick Mistris. [I] Beauty once blasted with the frost of Age or Sickness, is quite lost; He who loves that, and on it can, Dote till he be no longer Man, Hath neither Intellect or Eyes To judge where womans beauty lies: No, let him court your better part, Your virtues and your loyal heart. II If nought but beauty in you be, Your Picture seems as fair to me; He that admires your red and white, Is Traytor to his own delight; And with those shadows growes so blind He never can your sweetnesse find. Then let me court your better part, Your vertues, and your loyall heart. III Yet do I never hope to see Goodnesse lodg'd in deformitie; Though devils oft take shapes divine, Angels take none but such as thine; This made me make my choice of thee The emblem of divinitie; That I might court your better part, Your vertues, and your loyal heart. Amintors welladay. [I] Chloris now thou art sled away, Amintor's sheep are gon astray; And all the joy he took to see, His pretty Lambs run after thee, Is gon is gon, and he alone, Sings nothing now but welladay, welladay. II His Oaten pipe that in thy praise Was wont to play such roundelays, Is thrown away, and not a swain Dares pipe, or sing, within his plain; 'Tis death for any now to say One word to him but welladay. II The Maypole where thy little feet So roundly did in measures meet, Is broken down, and no content Comes near Amintor since you went. All that I ever heard him say Was Chloris, Chloris, welladay. IV Upon those Banks you us'd to tread He ever since hath laid his head, And whisper'd there such pining woe, As not a blade of grass will grow; O Chloris! Chloris! come away, And hear Amintor's welladay. Affection for a Lady he never saw. [I] O now I find 'tis nought but Fate That makes us either love or hate; Yet I have heard the wiser tell, Love onely doth with Beauty dwell; And that the Eye the thief must play, To steal each others heart away. But 'tis not so I find with me, For I love one I ne're did see. II There's a Divinity in Love, That doth inspire us from above; Which needs no tutoring from the eyes, To make our hearts to Sympathize. Such Noble and Platonick fires, Will know no Object for desires: But Love's the good that dwels with thee, Although thy self they ne're did see. III Thy soul, not this, or t'other part, Hath sent her Cupids to my heart; And there like little Angels tell, What hidden vertues in thee dwell, Prompting my reason to suppose Thy Shape's Angelicall like those; Which I shall pray I ne're may see, Lest I should more distracted be. Freedome from Charmes. [I] Go, fair Inchantress! charm no more, But give thy fascinations o're; Since I have found a pow'rful Spel, That doth thy cunning Art excel; For when I think of thy disdain, I'm free from witchcraft, or from pain. II When I was young and unbetray'd, All then was Oracle you said; So innocent I was of guile, I thought love dwelt in every smile: But now that cloud of youth is spent, I find you'r all but complement. III I'le love no more, I'le learn to hate, I'le study to equivocate, And all my pleasures now shall be To cozen those would cozen me; For Loves best musick runs (I find) On fickle changes of the mind. Future Hope. [I] When shal I see my Captive heart That lies in Chloris brest? Or, when will Love again restore Those joys I once possest? Yet, 'tis a blessing I confess, When Fate is thus severe, Not to be barr'd of future Hopes to mitigate our fear. II The Tyrant Love would be depos'd, And from this Empire thrown, Were not his subjects fool'd with hope That mercy would be shown. Then Captive heart contented lye, And banish all despaire, Since there is hope that she may be As kind as she is faire. On a Black Ribbon. [I] Black as thy lovely Eyes and Hair, This Ribbon for thy sake I wear, To tye rebellious passions in, Lest they on other objects sin; Thus I Love's pris'ner am, and may Expect my sentence ev'ry day; My heart foretells me now that I am doom'd a slave to constancy. II How easie 'tis for to confine An am'rous and a willing minde! Soft Silk from your fair hands I feel Bindes faster far than chains of Steel: O let me still thy Bond-man be! I'le never sue for libertie; Let others boast that freedome have, 'Tis my content to be thy slave. A Resolution to love no more. [I] Let me alone, I'le love no more, Nor will I that fond God adore; All your perfections cannot move One am'rous thought in me to love: Yet I'me not old, nor yet diseas'd, But onely with your Sex displeas'd; Not that I e're was scorn'd by any, But because you can love too many. II Alas, where lies that great delight Men fancy in your red and white? The common Lilly and the Rose Are far more beautifull then those; And many objects in the Skies Outshine the lustre of your Eyes, Though Poets please sometimes to say Your Eyes are brighter than the Day. What wonder is there then in thee, When thou hast lost thy constancie? Cupids Artillery. [I] Alas poor Cupid! Art thou blind? Canst nor thy Bow and Arrows find? Thy Mother sure the Wanton playes, And layes 'em up for Holydayes. II Then Cupid mark how kind I'le be, Because thou once wert so to me; I'le arm thee with such powerful darts, Shall make thee once more god of hearts. III My Chloris Armes shall be thy bow, Which none but Love can bend you know; Her precious Haires shall make the String, Which of themselves wound every thing. Then take but Arrows from her Eyes, And all you shoot at surely dyes. A Lady to a young Courtier. [I] Love thee! Good Sooth, Not I; I've somewhat else to doe: Alas! you must go learn to talk, Before you learn to wooe: Nay fie, stand off, go too, go too. II Because you'r in the fashion, And newly come to Court, D'ye think your Clothes are Orators T'invite us to the Sport? Ha ha, who will not jeer thee for't! III Ne'r look so sweetly Youth, Nor fiddle with your Band, We know you trimme your borrow'd Curles To shew your pretty Hand; But 'tis too young for to command. IV Go practise how to jeer, And think each word a Jest, That's the Court wit: Alas! you'r out To think when finely drest, You please me or the Ladies best. V And why so confident! Because that lately we Have brought another lofty word Unto our pedegree? Your inside seems the worse to me. VI Mark how Sir Whacham fools; I marry there's a Wit Who cares not what he sayes or swears So Ladies laugh at it; Who can deny such blades a bit? Falshood discovered. [I] Fond woman, thou mistak'st thy mark; Thy reason guides thee in the dark: And though thy Cupids cannot see, Mine have too many eyes for thee. Alas, I read in ev'ry smile, The Arts you use when you beguile. II What though you swear to me, you love With passions equal to the Dove; And that your flames are blown no higher Than to the Sphere of chaste desire? Forgive me if I needs must say This is the common womans way. III Your Eyes like Suns I know can be As warm to any as to me, And yet you blush not oft to say You love but the Platonick way; Love how you will, and when you please, My heart shall sleep and take it's ease. Liberty. [I] Though thou hast Wit and Beauty too, Enough to make a Hermit wooe, And though you swear your heart is mine, Yet all this will not make me thine; My Cupids now are full of eyes, And that's the reason they'r so wise. Then Ladies wonder not at me, If I defire my libertie. II 'Tis time to call my passions in, That have so long in darkness bin; For now I see you only play To win a heart and so away; She that can number all her store Of servants, now is very poor: Then Ladies wonder not, &amp;c. III Spring-garden is the Market-place Where men are brought up for a face; Some with their hands, some with their eyes, Catch any new thing for a prize; That Lady now grows poor and pines, Who wants her slaves to dig her mines. Then Ladies wonder not, &amp;c. A Pot of Flowers presented to Chloris. [I] See Chloris, see, how Nature brings all What she owes to thee that springs; These Roses from your Cheeks did grow, Those Lillies from your Bosomes snow; This various Tulip from your Eyes, From whence it bears so rich a prize. II Those purple streams in Azure set, Gave being to this Violet; These sprigs of Bayes we ne'r did see Till you taught Shepherds Poetrie: And all these flowers of purest red Sprung up where once your finger bled. III These Pansyes which so low do creep, Grew up one Night where you did sleep; So did these Poppyes, and from thence They have their sleepy influence; And all their leaves became thus green In hope by you they should be seen. IV And here I bring them in an Urn Of water, which themselves did mourn, Fearing to wyther and grow drye By too much Sun-shine of your Eye; For if your Beams the World inflame, Poor things, they needs must feel the same. A doubt resolv'd. [I.] Fain would I love, but that I fear, I quickly should the willow wear; Fain would I marry, but men say, When Love is ty'd, he will away: Then tell me Love, what shall I doe, To cure these Fears when e're I wooe? II. The Fair one she's a mark to all; The Brown one each doth Lovely call; The Black's a pearl in Fair mens Eyes; The rest will stoop to any prize. Then tell me love, &amp;c. III. Reply. Young Lover, know it is not I That wound with Fear or Jealousie; Nor do men ever feel those smarts Until they have confin'd their hearts: Then if you'l cure your Fears, you shall Love neither Fair, Black, Brown, but all. To the first object of Content. [I] Why up so early in the world, And fondly led about From place to place to seek Content And could not find thee out? Alas! 'tis plain I was abus'd, I did mistake the light Which quickneth ev'ry Lovers eye, And gives a perfect sight. II Thou art the only Star that can Direct us where to find The way which I so long have sought To ease a troubled mind; Each limb of thine's so full of grace They ravish ev'ry Eye, And all the Musick that we know Is from their Harmony. III 'Tis You alone that do create The Beauties of the Spring, Those Shadows which from You reflect Adorneth ev'ry thing; Philosophers may govern Fools, But shall not tutor mee, For now I find that I was blind Until I found out thee. A Recantation. [I] Forgive me Love, what have I done! Abus'd the Stars, Eclips'd the Sun; And rashly call'd a Wandring light The Star whence true love borrows light: Yet mark the jest, She thinks that I Speak truth, and dote; Love knows I lie. II Will you not give men leave to sport, Alas, my heart commands a fort, Whence all the artillery of your Eyes Can make no breach, much lesse a prize: How subtle Ladies now are grown! Yet caught in Engines of their own. III My heart's no Coward, you shall see, To yield, because you shot at mee; A man o're come so quickly may Be taken pris'ner every day: Then Lady boast not of your prize, My heart still in his castle lyes. A description of Chloris. [I] Have you e're seen the morning Sun From fair Aurora's bosome run? Or have you seen on Flora's Bed, The Essences of White and Red? Then you may boast, for you have seen My Fairer Chloris, Beauties Queen. II Have you e're pleas'd your skilful eares With the sweet Musick of the Spheres? Have you e're heard the Syrens sing, Or Orpheus play to Hels black King? If so, be happy and rejoyce, For thou hast heard my Chloris voyce. III Have you e're smelt what Chymick skill From Rose or Amber doth distill? Have you been near that sacrifice The PhÅnix makes before she dies? Then you can tell (I do presume) My Chloris is the worlds perfume. IV Have you e're tasted what the Bee Steals from each fragrant Flower or Tree? Or did you ever taste that meat Which Poets say the Gods did eat? O then I will no longer doubt But you have found my Chloris out. Chloris a constant comfort. [I] Stay, stay ye greedy Merchants stay, Send not your ships so fast away, To trade for Jems or precious Ore, For now they'l be esteem'd no more; Sayl to the Indies of my Chloris Eyes, Cheeks, Hair, and Lips, there perfect treasure lies. II Come here Loves Hereticks that can Beleive ther's no true joy for man, See what refined pleasure flyes From ev'ry motion of her eyes; Gaze on my Chloris freely, then go tell To all the world where true Content doth dwell. III Forgive me Heavens if I adore Your Sun, or Moon, or Stars no more; Those often are eclips'd, and can As soon destroy as cherish man: But Chloris like a constant comfort shines, Not only to our Bodies but our Mindes. Inconstancy. [I] O tell me Love! O tell me Fate! Or tell some other pow'r; Who did Inconstancy create, That changeth ev'ry houre? Why should one creature seem this day The object of Content, To Morrow lose that new-born joy, And prove a punishment? II Fair Shapes and guilded Honours raise Rebellion in our hearts; Then blame not Cupid if he shoot Such sev'rall sorts of darts: Such sullen miseries as these Will wait on fickle Love; Be thou a Saint it is decreed She must inconstant prove. Amintor's Dream. [I] As sad Amintor in a Medow lay, Slumbring upon a bed of new-made Hay, A Dream, a fatal Dream unlock'd his eyes, Whereat he wakes, and thus Amintor cryes; Chloris, where art thou Chloris? Oh! she's fled, And left Amintor to a loathed Bed. II Heark how the Winds conspire with storm and rain To stop her course, and beat her back again: Heark how the heavens chide her in her way For robbing poor Amintor of his joy: And yet she comes not. Chloris, O! she's fled, And left Amintor to a loathed bed. III Come Chloris come, see where Amintor lies, Just as you left him, but with sadder Eyes; Bring back that heart which thou hast stoln from me, That Lovers may record thy Constancie: O no she will not. Chloris, O she's fled! And left Amintor, &amp;c. IV O lend me (Love) thy wings that I may flye Into her bosome, take my leave, and dye: What comfort have I now ith' world since she That was my world of joy is gone from me, My Love, my Chloris: Chloris, O she's fled And left Amintor to, &amp;c. V Awake Amintor from this dream, for she Hath too much goodnesse to be false to thee: Think on her Oathes, her Vows, her Sighes, her Tears, And those will quickly satisfie thy fears. No no, Amintor, Chloris is not fled, But will return into thy longing Bed. Chloris dead, lamented by Amintor. [I] Mourn, mourn with me, all true Enamour'd hearts, And Shepherds throw your pipes away: Cupid go burn thy Arrows and thy Darts, Let Night for ever smother Day: For Chloris our bright Sun is dead, And with her all our joys are fled. II Love is with grief congeal'd into a Stone, And o're my Chloris grave she lies; Where round about the Graces sit and moan, Neglecting other Deities: The valleys where her flocks she fed Are drown'd with tears since she is fled. III Then follow me, where comfort never shin'd; Down, down into some darker Cell; There see Amintor weep, till he grow blind And comfortless for ever dwell: The Gods I fear will soon repent This universall punishment. Here Endeth the Ayres for One Voyce to the Theorboe-Lute or Bass-Viol. [The Dialogues] A Dialogue on a Kisse. Among thy Fancies tell me this, What is the thing we call a Kiss? Question. Among thy Fancies tell me this, What is the thing we call a Kiss? Resol. I shall resolve you what it is: It is a creature born and bred betwixt the lips all cherry-red, by love and warm and warm desires fed; Chorus both together. And makes more sweet, and makes more sweet, and makes more sweet the Bridal bed. It is an active flame that flyes first to the Babies of the Eyes, and charms it there, and charms it there, with lulla lullabyes, lulla lulla lulla lulla lulla lulla byes. And stills the Bride, and stills the Bride, and stills the Bride too when she cryes. Then to the Chin, the Cheek, the Ear, it frisks, it flyes now here, now there, 'tis now far off, and now 'tis neer: Tis here and there tis here and there tis here and there and ev'ry where. Has it a voycing vertue? Yes, How speaks it then? do you but this, part your joy'nd lips then speaks the kiss: And this Loves sweet, and this Loves sweet, and this Loves sweetest language is. Has it a Body? I, and wings, with thousand various colourings, and as it flyes it sweetly sweetly sings, Love hony yields but never stings! Chorus. And as it flyes it sweetly sings, Love hony yield, but never stings. A Dialogue between a Lover and his Friend. I love a Nymph Lover. I love a Nymph. Friend. A lack a day! Lover. But dare not say I love her. Friend. Perhaps she may thy love repay; speak then thy thoughts, and prove her. Lover. If I reveal, and she reject my love, I'm quite undone. Friend. Weomen when we do least expect, we see are often wonne. Lover. True, but her state great flocks requires, mine are but poor and small. Friend. Peace Fool, love onely love desires, and nothing else at all. Chorus for three together. They who do love for private gain, may suffer shipwrack, may suffer shipwrack, may suffer shipwrack in the Main. A Dialogue. StrephonâAmaryllis. Streph. Come come Amaryllis, I am ty'd by oath, which now I must fulfill; let Fate my Soul from Earth divide, if Damon be not constant still: and the poor Swain, sits under yonder tree, with sighs bewailing your severitie.

There let him sit sighing his fill, and take his labour for his hire; or piping go from hill to hill, till Sunbeams his false pipe do fire: It moves not me, this this I onely grieve, I e're did him, and cannot you believe. Streph. Are apples gather'd from a tree, and put into fair Chloris hand, symptomes of his Inconstancie? Is this a breaking of Loves band? No, no, he ne'r lov'd Chloris; heark, heark he cryes, Come Amaryllis, come Amaryllis, or your Damon dyes. Amar. Ah Strephon, could I but be sure, that this unfeignedly were true, and that the tears he sheds were pure, I then could pity, I could pity more than you, and entertain the Eccho of his cryes, Come Damon come, Come Damon come, or Amaryllis dyes. Chorus. Thus Amaryllis to her Damon turn'd, whose Life was almost into Cinders burn'd: the gods will Lovers crown, though sooner we can kindle love, can kindle love, than quench loves jealousie. A Dialogue. CleanderâFloramell. Awake, awake, fair Floramell Clea. Awake, awake, fair Floramell. Flor. I doe. Clea. But who freed thee from this inchanted spell? Flor. 'Twas you, such heav'nly Chymistry you taught, from earth sublim'd my purer thoughts. Chorus both together. Happy, thrice happy those who govern Fate, subjecting greater Mindes to meaner State. Clean. And how appears Earths glories now? Flor. They'r gone. Clean. Then on, fly, lest they once more dazel thee. Flor. I Run and undisturb'd my flocks Ile find, there guide them with a quiet mind. Chorus. Happy, thrice happy those can see and try the worlds fond glories so, and pass them by. Clean. But tell me, Canst thou thus retire? Flor. I can. Clean. But when? VVill not those hasty vows expire? Fond man, 'tis now the Souls affections more Ãtherial flames, diviner love. Chorus. Happy thrice happy Soul that ravish'd so, enjoys a second Heaven here below. Short Ayres for One, Two, or Three Voyces. [Once Venus Cheeks] Once Venus Cheeks that sham'd the Morn Once Venus Cheeks that sham'd the Morn, her hew let fall; her Lips that Winter had out-born, in June in June look'd pale; her Heat grew cold, her Nectar dry, no Dew she had but in her Eye, the wonted fire and flames to mortifie. When was this so dismal sight? When Adonis, Adonis bad Goodnight. [I have prais'd with all my skill] I have prais'd with all my skill each curious limb about thee I have prais'd with all my skill each curious limb about thee, so often, and yet do so still, that now each Swain can flout mee; and with nimble taunts can say, Sure this is some Bird of May. [When doth love set forth desire] When doth Love set forth Desire? When doth Love set forth Desire? In prime of Youth, men say. And when doth that again retire? When Beauty fades away! Then you in youth in youth that think on this, taste what the sweets, the sweets of Beauty is. [Trust the forme of Ayrie things] Trust the Form of Ayrie things, or a Syren when she sings Trust the Form of Ayrie things, or a Syren when she sings: Trust the slye Hyenna's voyce; or of all, Distrust make choyce. And believe these sooner then Truth in Women, Faith in Men. [Deer, throw that Flatt'ring Glass away] [I] Deer, throw that Flatt'ring Glass away, I have two truer for your turn; These Eyes I mean, wherein you may See how you blaze, and how I burn. II Ah! could you but as plainly there My Faith as your owne Face descry, You'ld gaze your self no other where, And burn (perhaps) as well as I. [Do not delay me, though you have the pow'r] [I] Do not delay me, though you have the pow'r Ages to stay me, O do't in an hour. Then do not slight me, O do not reject me! Say not what might be, since thus I affect thee. II No bodies stirring, O none that can hear thee! Then leave demurring since I am so near thee. This is the season each Bird is a building, You that have reason, O be not unwilling! [If you can find a heart (Sweet Love) to Rill] [I] If you can find a heart (Sweet Love) to Rill Yet grant me this, to read my latest Will: May all things smile on you, may nothing cross Your wish or will, who ever bears the loss. II May Fortunes wheel be ever in your hand, That you may never Sue, but still Command; And to these blessings, may your Beauty still Be fresh, and pow'rfull, both to save, and kill. [Sure thou framed wert by Art] [I] Sure thou framed wert by Art Purposely to take my Heart For such looks were ever made Onely for that Catching trade. II All thy Oathes and folded Armes, Sighing Blasts, bewitching Charms; Ev'ry Thought thou tend'st that way Was only lent me to betray. III False (alass) they are that swear, All Loves bargains are not dear. Know then Flatterer that I must Hear no more than I dare trust. IV You may promise, swear, and say, What perhaps you mean to day; But e're Morrows Sun be set, You another Love will get. V Had'st thou left me then untide Thou had'st never been denide, And I wish (for Maidens sake) None e're better bargain make. [Go PhÅbus clear thy face] Go PhÅbus, cleer thy face, collect thy rayes Go PhÅbus, cleer thy face, collect thy rayes; and from those Stars which to thee Tribute payes, draw back thy light, and in thy greatest pride view my Love, a Star, a Star not yet deifide. [I prethee send me back my heart] I I prethee send me back my heart, Since I cannot have thine; For if from yours you will not part, Why then should you keep mine? II Yet now I think on't, let it lye, To send it me were vain, For th'hast a thief in either eye Will steal it back again. FINIS.</field>
