      <field name="fulltext">To My Lord The King. Sonet Acrosticke. Image of God; first as a Man, and then As King, by most Desert, and onely Right: Man is the King of Creatures, and thy might Exceedes this too, for thou art King of men. Sunne of our Sphære, may neuer Clowde vp pen So radiant Beames from thy poore Subiects sight: That still our Eyes may see their happy Light, Eu'n as their Heate did warme our Bosoms, when Vnseene they shone beneath and fixed Star. Vp Noble Minde to thy fift Empirie, And soare yet higher then thy fortunes ar: Resemble Heau'n in all but Leuitie, Take after Earth in nothing more or lesse Except an irremooued Stayednesse. To The Bright Qveene Anne his deere Wife, and our dread Lady. 1 What is she that like siluer Cynthia shoeth Amidst the hoast of heauen, But fairer threetimes seauen? It is the Queene of Loue, see where she goeth: The Queene of Loue and Beauty, (lo) together With her faire son the Prince of Loue comes hether. 2 The Southpole that in our Horizon shined, And made the Earth to wonder, Gone is that Earth all vnder, And to the Northpole hath her roome resigned: On whom to waite our Eyes and Harts perseuer, And may they cease, ô neuer, neuer, neuer. 3 Thou in whose Zodiak of white armes enchained Our Sunne so oft hath shined, In whose wombe was confined What in this Isle scornes to be long contained; Liue thou and he, and maist thou see him rather Copartner then Successor to his Father. To My Lord The Prince. Sonet Acrosticke. Heire of thy Sires foure Realmes, and (which I more Esteeme) foure vertues, that vnto a fift, No doubt will thee (o slowly slowly) lift; Receiue this Ryme of thine old Auncestore Long Prince of Wales, and pardon me therefore. So may glad Victory be one day swift To crowne thy sacred head (that art a grift Extracted hence) with holy Bayes, before (Vnuanquish'd or vnhurt by sea or land) Vpon thy brow the Wreath of England sit: And I with crowned head, but armed hand, Ride by thy Lordly side, and after it Turne from thy Grandsires loues to sing thy wars, Exchanging Venus Mole for Marses skars. E: B: Anacreontickes. Scarse 'till now hath England seen A Poëm, but of verses store; Here an vnenforced green Hath natiue flowres, which heretofore Had, at most, well painted been, As was the season which them bore: Arts each Venus that doth shine In antient Poësie, heer more. Holland, this first birth of thine Put forth imperfect, stands before The finished, and shall in fine Somewhat be new for worlds t'adore: Cynthivs (as we diuine) And the Mvses, and the Graces, And their Qveene, by thee refine Bastard Songs, whose common bases Were but words, that Katharine Beautie equall to her faces Might enioy. Here then vnhard A Princely Love, and learned Bard. Ben: Iohnson. Ode. ??????????. Who saith our Times nor haue, nor can Produce vs a blacke Swan? Behold, where one doth swim; Whose Note, and Hue, Besides the other Swannes admiring him, Betray it true: A gentler Bird, then this, Did neuer dint the breast of Tamisis. Marke, marke, but when his wing he takes, How faire a flight he makes! How vpward, and direct! Whil'st pleas'd Apollo Smiles in his Sphære, to see the rest affect, In vaine to follow: This Swanne is onely his, And Phœbus loue cause of his blackenesse is. He shew'd him first the hoofe-cleft Spring, Neere which, the Thespiad's sing; The cleare Dircæan Fount Where Pindar swamme; The pale Pyrene, and the forked Mount: And, when they came To brookes, and broader streames, From Zephyr's rape would close him with his beames. This chang'd his Downe; till this, as white As the whole heard in sight, And still is in the Brest: That part nor Winde, Nor Sunne could make to vary from the rest, Or alter kinde. “So much doth Virtue hate, “For stile of rarenesse, to degenerate. Be then both Rare, and Good; and long Continue thy sweete Song. Nor let one Riuer boast Thy tunes alone; But proue the Aire, and saile from Coast to Coast: Salute old Mône, But first to Cluid stoope low, The Vale, that bred thee pure, as her Hills Snow. From thence, display thy wing againe Ouer Iërna maine, To the Eugenian dale; There charme the rout With thy soft notes, and hold them within Pale That late were out. “Musicke hath power to draw, “Where neither Force can bend, nor Feare can awe. Be proofe, the glory of his hand, (Charles Montioy) whose command Hath all beene Harmony: And more hath wonne Vpon the Kerne, and wildest Irishry, Then Time hath donne, Whose strength is aboue strength; And conquers all things, yea it selfe, at length. Who euer sipt at Baphyre riuer, That heard but Spight deliuer His farre-admired Acts, And is not rap't With entheate rage, to publish their bright tracts? (But this more apt When him alone we sing) Now must we plie our ayme; our Swan's on wing. Who (see) already hath ore-flowne The Hebrid Isles, and knowne The scatter'd Orcades; From thence is gon To vtmost Thule: whence, he backes the Seas To Caledon, And ouer Grampius mountaine, To Loumond lake, and Twedes blacke-springing fountaine. Haste, Haste, sweete Singer: Nor to Tine, Humber, or Owse, decline; But ouer Land to Trent: There coole thy Plumes, And vp againe, in skies, and aire to vent Their reeking fumes; Till thou at Tames alight, From whose prowde bosome, thou began'st thy flight. Tames, prowde of thee, and of his Fate In entertaining late The choise of Europes pride; The nimble French; The Dutch whom Wealth (not Hatred) doth diuide, The Danes that drench Their cares in wine; with sure Though slower Spaine; and Italy mature. All which, when they but heare a straine Of thine, shall thinke the Maine Hath sent her Mermaides in, To hold them here: Yet, looking in thy face, they shall begin To loose that feare; And (in the place) enuie So blacke a Bird, so bright a Qualitie. But should they know (as I) that this, Who warbleth Pancharis, Were Cycnvs, once high flying With Cupids wing; Though, now by Loue transform'd, &amp; dayly dying: (Which makes him sing With more delight, and grace) Or thought they, Leda's white Adult'rers place Among the starres should be resign'd To him, and he there shrin'd; Or Tames be rap't from vs To dimme and drowne In heau'n the Signe of old Eridamos: How they would frowne! But these are Mysteries Conceal'd from all but cleare Propheticke eyes. It is inough, their griefe shall know At their returne, nor Po, Iberus, Tagus, Rheine, Scheldt, nor the Maas, Slow Arar, nor swift Rhone; the Loyre, nor Seine, With all the race Of Europes waters can Set out a like, or second to our Swan. To my Mayden Muse. Goe Virgin Muse to her Diuinity, That is the Vesta of Virginity: For vnto whom shouldst thou goe rather So bound to her, and to her father? Be gonne, and when thou com'st before her, Vpon thy knee, see thou adore her. For thou mayst gather by her feature, She is more then an earthly creature. In whom no Elements are combined, But a fift Essence well refined Aboue the vulgar grosse confections Of any of the fower complexions, Flegme, Sanguine, Melancholy, Coler. Tell her that once I was her Scholer, And how in Grammer I was grounded In the best schoole she euer founded, By two great Clerkes (two greater wasters Of oyle then houres) that were my Masters; Where I liu'd partly of her larges, And partly of my parents charges. Thence was I had to learne more knolledge To Cambridge, and her fathers Colledge, Of him whose fame is flowne All-Over As well beyond as this side Douer. On Aristotle oft I pored, And here and there him ouer-skored. Where Poetrie too I found defined, To which by birth I was enclined. Yet heard I worthy Downes in Homer, And euery day I glean'd my gomer. Thus hauing there for Lea serued Though some saide Rachel I deserued) Some thought the house could stand without me. I then began to looke about me: And forthwith desperately did ventre The wide world, in whose little Centre My friends (of whom death hath bereft me) My louing friends some liuing left me, Enough (if God the grace but lend me) From Cold and Hunger to defend me: That I may study still by leasure, Without all paine, and at my pleasure. Now the blacke Doune began to couer My pale Cheekes (for I was a Louer) And sung Acrosticke Sonets sweetely; For (if that some can iudge discreetely) I neede not feare that daintie Davies, Though he sing sweeter then the Mauis. And of my Loue they were. But stay thee, No more of that my Muse I pray thee. For either it must show my folly, Or else renew my Melancholly: Yet was she faire, and Honourable, And Vertuous (had she beene more stable.) Though she perhaps did but forget her, And now likes May denhead the better: Whereof she is the richest border Next Cynthia Soueraigne of that Order. When Loue my bosome thus had fired, Me for his Prophet he inspired: That euery line, and euery letter Of my deuise might passe the better. Yet of this Legend but the writer Was I, and he the sole inditer. For how alas can it be other? I am not I the Muses brother. My lips I neuer yet haue sowsed In Hippocrene, nor carowsed The lusty Liquor thence distilling The braine with holly fury filling. The Climat where I was begotten Of father Phœbus is forgotten, No Parnasse there (though Mountaines many) Nor Muse (though Nymphs as faire as any) God wote it is too farre remoued From her, to be of them beloued. Apollo, they and all the Graces, Attend her onely in all places. This in effect when thou hast told her, Thou must be yet a little bolder: And beg that thou mayst waite vpon her, Among her many Maydes of Honor; A modest Maide with chaste variety, To lull asleeepe that sweete Society. Who may as well as any other, Reade euery line before the Mother. So shamefa'cd are they, and so holly, Voide of all loosenesse, and light folly: Else had it beene too much impiety, To vow them to so great a Deity. This done, againe on knee lowe bended, And hands as high to heauen extended, Ascribe me of this golden story Onely the paine, and her the glory: Praying she would but reade the proem, And so breath life into my Poëm PANCHARIS: The First Booke. I sing Queene Katharine and my countryman. O Loue (if I before thy Altare spread, Blacke though I be, haue oft lookt pale &amp; wan; And as white Turtles there haue offered, As are those that thy whiter mother drawe) Draw neere, and with her Myrtle decke the head Of me thy priest, that am too rudely rawe, Nor once haue bin baptized in the spring Of Helicon, which yet I neuer saw. A pinion plucke me out of thine owne wing: And let thy godhead more propitious be Vnto my thoughts whiles others loues I sing, Then in mine owne it hath been vnto me. And thou O second Sea-borne Queene of Loue, In whose faire forehead Loue and Maiestie Still kisse each other (as the Turtle-doue Doth her beloued) thou whose frowne, whose smile Presenteth both, who dost inspire and moue This lesser Continent, this greatest Ile: Let smiling Loue, when Maiesty would frowne, Infuse like life and motion to my Stile. I treate not I here of the awfull Crowne, (Though somewhat of the court) my Legend is Composde of Loue and Beautie vp and downe, Where if I aught haue saide that sounds amisse, Immortall Maid, thou pardon mee that crime, Sith thy white hand which (lord) I long to kisse May crosse out all, and rectifie my rime. So shall the amorous Readers seeme as those, That haue seene thee full oft and many a time. Yet seeing thee againe, anone suppose They somewhat see they neuer saw before, Such spangling obiects thou dost still disclose, As all desire to see thee more and more. From London Westward doth a Castle stand Along the Thames, which of the winding shore Is called Windsore, knowne by sea and land, For the rich Guarter and the holy George There founded first by the victorious hand Of warlike Edward, he that was the scorge And second hammer of the haughty Scot. As the lame God in his Trinacrian Forge Striu'd first to blow the stubborne yron hot, And after laide about him like a Lord, Till he thereof the vpper hand had got: So English Edward did with fire and sword, Lighten and Thunder in that Northerne Clime, And neuer respite did his foe afford, (No nor himselfe almost) vntill the time As hardy Dauid grac'd faire Windsores Court. Where also Iohn of France, who long'd to clime The wheele of Fortune in the selfe same sort, A captiue King was after shortly seene. Yet neither this, nor that, so much report The fame of Windsore, as faire Katherine; She that hath yet (saue her great Neece) no other, Daughter of France, of England Mother-Queene, The sixt Charles daughter, the sixt Henries mother, And (which is chiefest) the fixt Henries Wife. Here the sad Queene ful many a sigh did smother, Resolued still to leade a Widdowes life. So chaste was she, though faire, and rich, and yong, That yong and olde to praise her were at strife: Of her high honour all Musitians sung, And thereto each sweet Poet tun'd his pen, That therewith England and all Europe rung. She was the wonder of all mortall men, Few Queenes came neere her, &amp; none went aboue, In grace and goodnesse, since, before, or then. Might once no minion dare to kisse her gloue (Much lesse her hand) or Mistresse her mis-call; As men are wont, when they for fashion loue. So modest was she, and so meeke withall, That all good folkes might to her Presence come No lesse then to some Councellors common Hall. More doth the suter than the gaudy roome, Set out a Monarchs Maiestie, by ods, When life or death he lookes for at his doome. Not they that grau'd the gold did make the gods, But such as did before them bow to begge, All were they made of clay but only clods: Nor they the Prince that still prouoke and egge, (That only they may golden Idolls be To which the subiect bends his seruile legge) The sacred and annointed Maiestie To robbe the realme, to gaine the subiects wealth, And loose their hearts; But such as on the knee Importune grace with happinesse and health, Not posted off to those extreame delayes Of bribing fauorites, which is worse then stealth, And scarce was heard of in those happy dayes. Her selfe a widdow, would for widowes pleade With much compassion, and at al assayes, But as for Orphanes bills, them would she reade, And then shut in her princely Orphans hand, Whereby along with her she would him leade Vnto his Vncle that did rule the land: Hard were the heart, that in so iust a cause, With two such suters vpon tearmes could stand, And not dispence a little with the lawes. Thus with her great delight in doing good, Shee wanne such fame and popular applause, That on a time the goddesse of the wood Diana sorely longed once to see This abstract model of all womanhoode, And next her selfe the flowre of chastitie. Wherefore the (Sunne now scorching in the skull Of Leo) foorth a hunting needes would shee To Windesore forrest, which she found as ful Of deere, as trees: yet trees so many ar, As there the darts of Phœbus are too dull; And pierce no more then doth the meanest starre. There was the Lawrell that was glad to hide Her greene head from the face of Phœbus farre, The Lordly Oake that scorn'd not by his side The bragging Brier, and with wilde yuie was Like great God Bacchus crownd, there was, beside The smoothskinn'd Beech all kerued as did passe, In curious knotts that did the names entwine Of many a Louer, and of many a Lasse. There was the Elme that vnderprops the Vine, And Box, wherof poore shephards frame their pipes, The gentle Woodbind, and sweete Eglantine, Each other clipping with their amorous gripes. The budded Hawthorn, and our London dames Holy-reformers: the Birch lacing stripes On lasie truands, with such like, whose names I know not, saue the Willow that did guirde The bankes forsaken of the slippry Thames. On euery tree did sit a seuerall bird, And euery bird did sing his seuerall note: This to the base a fift, that sung a third, Each one according to his aery throate. A Summers day me thinkes were nothing long With the rare Musike which they made by rote: Phœbe her selfe with all her Nymphs did throng To heare it, as she had not heauenly beene: And this was all the burden of their Song, Long liue Diana and faire Katherene. Wearied with toile, but neuer with the noyse, High time she thought to goe and see the Queene, For her declining brother, that enioyes One part in one of her three-formed realmes, Bade her breake vp those sports and earthly ioyes, Sith he must neuer quench his thirsty beames, Till she to heauen returne and take his place To gouerne there the starres, and here the streames. She therefore to the Castle gan to pace That bounteously was built of faire free-stone, Whose guilded inside, for the greater grace, Was all set out with many a precious one, And they with one that yet more precious was: The cristall windowes round about it shone, That as she stood therein the very glasse Seem'd rather to let out the lusty light. On did the goddesse with her meany passe, Till they came to a roome all richly dight, Of heauenly blisse and happinesse the bowre, Where each of other had this happy sight. The place was after calld the Maydens towre, But of Diana and her Maydes no doubt So called was, and is vnto this howre. Much the amazed goddesse look'd about, But most astoned at the Queene shee stood, That ready word she could bring hardly out, Before the louely Queene, (who could more good Then halfe a world) did silence softly breake, Each Lilly blending with a Rose of blood. Madame (she sayde) my tongue can hardly speake That world of worth which I in you admire: Then all that I can doe is farre too weake To answere your desert and my desire: For since my Lord, my life, (God his soule saue) Was laide (as well may witnesse my attire) My better halfe since he was laide in graue, I neuer yet came foorth in companie; But in my chamber my selfe buried haue. Wherefore, if person here, or aught there be, That vnto you may breede the least offence, God knowes it is without my priuitie: But did I knowe, I soone should rid him hence, That of this action is not humbly glad, And therewithall, they both lowe reuerence Did one another. Vp the while was had A Banquet to a by rome as did passe, Bisket-bread, Sucket, Marchpane, Marmalad, Candids, Conserues, and all that dainty was: It haild downe comfects, and through euery spoute The Sugar-Castles powrd out hypocras Walk'd vp and downe the boles, so as I doubt If I may call them standing cups or no. And as the wine, so went the day about. Diana rose, and ready was to goe, When in an other cup of massie golde They crownd her wine that sparkled to and fro. It was the king Confessors Cup of old, Who liu'd a maried man, and died a maide. She kist the cup, where grau'n, she might beholde Actæons death, and downe it quickly laid, Then turn'd a little to her maydes aside, Rebuk't their want of secrecie, and saide. Could ye no better your owne counsailes hide, But ouer England too it must be blaz'd? Lo heere, Actæon in his horned hide While on our shame and nakednesse he gaz'd: Therewith she pawz'd, but they no word could say, So were they at that liuely mappe amaz'd. And sure the cup did all so wel display, As if it white wine were that therein stoode. Then would ye sweare Dianaes selfe there lay, Nakedly clothed with the cristall flood: And were it redde, there lay then would ye sweare, Actæon bathing him in his owne blood. At last, as one that halfe abashed were, Vnto the Queene she turn'd and vttred this. Alacke, alacke, if his owne hownds did teare This fond Actæon, yet the fault was his, And mine the griefe: we gods are no lesse sory For mortalls punishments, then for their amisse, Though we, by this, and that, declare our glory, And our owne iustice in them both exalte: Yet some will say (and they too peremptory) That this his fortune was, and not his fault: Was't not his fault so to prophane a place, That hallowed was with franckincense and salt? Were't not his fault that should surprise your grace Here in your chamber, skare you or your traine, And from your side your surest seruants race? Abortiue fansies swimme about his braine, And faile him when himselfe he most assures: Runne all his plots and purposes in vaine, That shall the like attempts on you or yours. 'Thus ended she, and with this speach the day. On stole the night, that parting stil procures, As though it came to bid her come away, Then tooke she leaue, and in her coach did clime, The Easterne hill with horses yron gray, Where in slowe minutes she must tell the time, And serue the vse of man. God bade her so. When neither Cocke doth crow, nor Clocke doth chime, Whether we see her siluer face or no, Yet there she walkes, as wel by day as night, And still about her cristall orbe doth goe. But (lord) with what a longing and delight To Windsor ward she downe woulde cast her looke, And guild the wide Thames with hir trembling light. An other heauen ye would haue thought the brooke With Moone and Stars, and here and there a cloude: But in high heau'n what way so e're she tooke, Queene Katharines praises there she rung aloude, Set to the tune of her well tempred spheare, Much more harmonious then is harpe and croud. Hermes, that all the ghosts belowe can reare, And gently vsher with his snaky rod, To this new Caroll gaue attentiue care: And (as he is a very prating god) To the bright Venus hath it told anone From the first point to the last period. When she in all the haste would needes be gone To see below, what all had heard aboue, Of Englands Queene and peerelesse paragon: Her Coach was drawne by many a Turtle-doue, And driuen by a coachman of great worth, Her little sonne, the mighty god of Loue. So long he guided on his course by North, When hauing past the seauenth and vtmost clime, Out of the sea he might see peeping foorth A spot of Earth as white as any lime: To which he thought it best his course to hold. Now was the Earth, for it was past the prime, That had vnmask'd her of her tawny old, Reuested with a flowry diadem, And new greene veluet, spangled all with gold. Thus were the fields enameld all of them, Along the siluer Thames that did embrace The golden meades in wanton armes, and hem Their looser skirts like an indented lace. Acrosse, and vp and downe the riuer swame Her sacred swannes, who when they saw her Grace, Vnto her Coach to doe their homage came: And from the land came Turtles many a paire, Vnto her Deity who did the same. Then Citherea seeing them so repaire Bespake, Sir boy, we sure be gone amisse: (But yet, the best is this, the way was faire) Nay doubtlesse, that no way to Windsore is, But to our palace in mount Citheron. And Cupid he was sore afraide by this Lest it were so indeede, when (hauing gone A little further) he might plainely see Where with his eye a castle met anone High on a hill (as though it scorn'd to be Built on the baser earth) and towr'd aboue The lofty clowds, with such a Maiestie, As saide it could not be the Court of Loue. Howe often haue you seene together dwell The lordly Eagle and the lowely Doue, Or Loue and Maiesty concording well? By this, they to the castle-gate be come, That was shut in by warning of a bell, In euery roome yet stirring heard they some, Which made them loudly call, and loudly knocke, Yet none, no more then if they had bin dombe, Would answer them; a long houre by the clocke, They waited there; now he, now she, now both: Cupid at last did peepe in at the locke, Yet no man came; Then Venus waxed wroth, And since of force she must her purpose misse To be reueng'd she tooke a solemne othe And saide. Much worship haue we won iwis, If thus one silly woman may abuse Two such great Godheads; if wee suffer this, What wretch I pray you may not well refuse To burne on our high altars his perfumes, And by this president the fact excuse? Whether she on our gentlenesse presumes, Or her owne greatnesse, all is one for that, I shall ere long so pull her peacockes plumes, That though she now be young and faire and fat) She shall no sooner looke vpon a glasse But she shall greeue and sore repine thereat, And say, That now is hay was sometimes grasse. Thinkes she to scape our hands so franke and free, That she forsooth of France the daughter was, Englands fresh bride, and thereby chaunc'd to be Mother to him that now is King of both? Alas, what's all this to a Deitie? No more but titles and meere toies in troth, As then she hath deseru'd, so shall she haue, “Diuine reuenge comes sure, though late and loth. Belike these giddie French thinke they may braue My sonne and me at pleasure, leaue vndone What at their hands most lawfully we craue, Or do all lawlesse outrage vnder Sunne. They make but eu'n a Woman and a childe Of me and thee, and thereby thinke to shunne Our vengeance, this it is to be so milde To malefactors, that for very spight Our Temples and our Altars haue defilde, Left vnprophaned no religious rite, But hauocke made of holy maiden-head, As if the Charge we had renounced quite That appertaineth to the Bridall bed: Wherein the lawfull heire begotten is, Whom after nine months fully finished, The shame-fac't father shall not feare to kisse At midnight to him by the Midwife borne, Yea he himselfe will sweare it to be his, When Lucifer lets foorth the blushy Morne. But if they still my patience thus shall wrong By S. Adonis here loe haue I sworne, And will not faile, I shall, ere it be long, A plague send on them that will quickely tame Their pride, and teach them sing another song. It shall feede in their marow like a flame, And rage through eu'ry corner of the land, That of the nation it shall take the name. But to the point that now we haue in hand. Which to effect with more successefull speede, Sonne Cupid, you awhile my friend must stand. Mother (quoth he) to feare you shal not neede, For I haue still beene your obsequious sonne, And still wil be, in thought, and word, and deed. Yet hold I not this dame so much, a Nunne By nature, as by vertue of the clime Is far remoued Northward from the Sunne, For she hath lou'd, and so may do in time. The bird that hauing once escap't the net, Defies the fowler, may be caught by lime Or other engines that for him be set, And so may she by some more quaint deuise, But what that is, my selfe knows skarcely yet) Maugre her heart all were it made of yce. Gramercie sonne, quoth he, why then no doubt (Though she were ten times more then she is nice) This act we shall bring well inough about. But that I feare me which you lately tolde About the Climat all this Isle throughout, Is all the let that euer happen could, For 'though the Sunne now in the Lion raigne, And his Meridian, yet an vncouth cold Me thinks doth hit me now through euery vaine. In Affricke if the Lyon list to rage, Who shall him from his Ladyes side restrayue? Yet here he sleepeth out his idle age, And dreames not once of Natures kindely sport. Were it not this, what grate or yron cage Could coope him from his pleasure? To be short, The Vine that with the scorching sunne by noone, Growes quickely ripe in France, if you transport Into this Country, ripeneth not so soone: Yet is the soyle as thankful heere as there. Yea th'Elements, all vnderneath the Moone, Remou'd from their owne place, some otherwhere, Take new impressions to them, for the fire That only shines in his celestiall sphere Here burnes most violent. And with desire Said Cupid, shall this Saint, this Katherine In Windshore burne whom he did so admire, The man of Monmouth when she did but shine In France at Melaws, like a blazing starre: Whose faire aspect and influence diuine, Did stoppe the hoarse and open throate of warre. As there great Henry fel in loue with her, Heere of another shall she dote as farre, Except my cunning, or this hand doe erre: And that rich dowre, yea were it ten times moe, Vpon a subiect shall I soone conferre. What, on a Saxon Cupid, will yee so? Now by this Mole (quoth she) vpon my cheeke, I rather had this high reuenge forgoe Which I on her so thirstingly do seeke, Then any flinty Saxon should succeede A Prince so mighty, and a Prince so meeke. These Saxons clean haue wash'd away my seede, Swallowing the fat soyle like another flood: Those sturdy Saxons whom the stones did breede, Which Pyrrha (when yet all the earth was mudde) By diuelish diuination backeward threw To take the forme of flesh, and bones, and blood. These men, these stones, at an aduantage slew Of thy poore kindred thousands with the sword, And all the wofull remnant did pursue To the bare Mountaines, that could scarce afford Foode for themselues, or safety from the foe, Fowly intreating them in deede and word. Long were they torne and tosst thus to and fro, Now foiling, and then foild, till at the last Edward the first (their fates ordaining so) To make them subiect to his Crowne did cast. His tender babe to be their Prince they tooke, To whose succeeding heires they stucke so fast, As none of them their faith as yet forsooke, Saue onely one Owen sirnam'd Glyndoore, Who became Rebell against Bullinbrooke, And by his pride made all his Country poore. Ah Harry why shouldst thou a Ciuill Prince For one mans fault and fury play the Moore Or Tartar thus, and tax a whole Prouince With such vncourteous and Barbarian lawes As neuer heard were of before, or since? If loue alas, as oft as men giue cause Did euery time but hurle a fiery ball, A little time then should he haue to pause, And in a while himselfe leaue none at all. For all yet that betide them could, or can, Here liues one still, and stil I hope he shall, A gallant and resolued gentleman, Faire Owen Tudyr, fire thou hir in loue With him, my boy. Mother (said he) your Swanne Shall not exceede this Eagle, nor your Doue: Hereafter shall she stoope so to the lure, Though now a while the clowds she towre aboue, For her pure bosome with a brand as pure I wil so kindle yet before the sunne Get out of Libra, that none may recure Her heart, but onely Owen. Well saide sonne, (Him answered she) why should I then despaire? But (as one Owen hath vs all vndone) Another Owen may those harmes repaire. For who doth know, but that in time to come, There may spring from this wel consorted paire (I will so blesse and fructifie her wombe) H.7. That seauen times happy man, who one day may Sit on this throne, and thence with mercy doome His and my people? O when will that day Shine from the East vpon this Northerne Clime? Then, then may well both Welch and English say, That they were borne in a most blessed time. Mother, quoth he, thereof mine be the care, And if I faile therein, mine be the crime: But sith the court of heauen can hardly spare Vs both at once, this cause to me referre, Perhaps the Gods in no such busines are, Yet mortalles are. How shall the Mariner That long in the wide Ocean tossed is, And nothing sees saue sea and heau'n, but ere When your propitious starre he there doth misse? How shall the shepheard doe, that to the hill Leades forth his flocke, and home againe by this? How shall the strugling Bride against her will, With her impatient loue this night conceaue, Vnles your gratious influence doe fill Her fruitfull lap? Gods must not therefore leaue To helpe and comfort mortall men, because Of their due honor they the Gods bereaue. This said, he stayd, and with this only clause She condescended, that all should be done, As that her selfe therto her best applause Should giue, and that as soone too as the sunne A iudge betweene the night and day became. O silly Queene! these snares how canst thou shun? And how, O Venus (hadst thou any shame?) Canst thou but blush what haue ye reap't by this, Thou and thy sonne, what great and glorious name, When by two Gods beguyld one Woman is? A month and more to make the Queene his slaue He sought by all such traines and trickes of his As knowe ye louers (God from them me saue) By dreames and fansies whilst abed she lay: So wisely though herselfe she did behaue, That once he thought it best to runne away. By this the golden Eye of heau'n the Sunne, From that disastrous and midnight of day Wherin his clewe of life was cleane out spunne, Henry the first in fame, in name the fift, About the siluer skarfe of heau'n had runne. Whose firy Coursers (howsoeuer swift To some glad harts) seeme to the sory slow And dull as lead, then first the Queene did lift Her drooping Ey-liddes from the Earth belowe. As one that hauing horded vp his cheefe His only treasure, still his eye doth throwe Backe to the place as to his best releefe; So was the Queene. and all the Court to glose The more with her did flatter this her griefe: For like the Prince the people them compose. Moou'd for their sakes, God wot, more then her owne, The Dowager Queene (like to the Virgin Rose That all night is bedew'd, and newly blowne Vnto the morning Sunne for comfort seekes) Those purer Roses wiping that were sowne Among the Lillies in her louely cheekes; And with her teares bedewed day and night By the full space of two and fiftie weekes, Resolu'd at last to come by candle-light Into the Presence chamber, and to glad Her heart a little with the peoples sight, Who to see her againe were nothing sad. For all the lusty Courtiers did deuise (So soone as notice of her minde was had) To entertaine her with some strange disguise, Done by Dan Lidgate a great learned Munke, Who then in Poesie bare away the prise; For after Chaucer had he deepely drunke Of Helicon, as few besides haue yet. Now when the Sunne into the Sea was suncke, They all together in the Wardrobe met, And them among (though farre aboue them all) The gentle Owen was, a man well set: Broad were his shoulders, thogh his waste but smal; Straight was his backe, and euen was his breast, Which no lesse seemely made him shew, then tall. Such as Achilles seem'd among the rest Of all his army clad in mighty brasse: Among them such (though all they of the best) The man of Mone magnifique Owen was. He seem'd an other Oake among the Breers: And as in stature, so did he surpas In wit, and actiue feates, his other peeres. He nimbly could discourse, and nimbly daunce, And ag'd he was about some thirty yeeres: But armed had ye seene him go to France, Ye would haue saide, that few on foote or horse Could haue so toss'd a Pike, or cowch'd a Lance, Wherewith to ground he brought full many a corse. That oft alone when I recount the same, My tender heart cannot but haue remorse. To write it then, alas, I were too blame: Of onely Loue, and of his armes I sing, Thy warres (O Mars) I meant not once to name, Yet hardly could I spare that haughty string, Did not the Boy mine eare pull now and then Beyond my bounds for feare I chance to fling. The fame and splendor of my Countrymen Inuite me so. What is he that can holde In his rude fingers such a flaggy pen, If aught by chance of Agincourt be tolde, But into teares his eies would quickely thawe, In steade of inke, to write the manifolde And goodly slaughters which our men did drawe That day in blood? But O thou mighty ghost Of Henry Monmouth, who yet holdes in awe My bolder Ditty that so longs to boast Those olde Heroês crown'd with holie bayes, That vnder him did vse to leade his hoste; Beauforts, Veres, Neuills, Talbots, Cliffords, Grayes: O pardon thou, and they that I leaue out Th'immortall mortall fights and blody frayes By force of armes there fairely brought about. And thou Iohn Huntington, whose acts I more Admire than all, before whose face the rout Of fearefull Normans, when thou cam'st ashore From the triumphed Ocean fled away As heartlesse Hares the Greyhounds doe before: Redoubted Earle, of pardon I thee pray. God wot I would, yet halfe so great a taske I dare not vndertake: and sooth to say, That argument a lowder Trump doth aske. To sound a March too slender is my Reede, Inough is it to tune a Courtly maske, Then to high purpose and the point proceede. While they made ready there, ye might haue seen, One or an other in a masking weede, Go friske about vpon the rushes greene, And wish if aught he chanced well to do, That all were done no worse before the Queene. Some one the God of Loue did pray vnto, With his milde mother, so to stand his friend, As he thereby his Ladies loue might woe, To whose sweete praise his paines he did commend. Another, that he might good honors make As eu'ry Measure did beginne or end Whereof his Mistris might due notice take. One that the dropping linkes defilde him not For his white suite of costly satten sake: An other that his Imprease or his Mot, Or aught of his the Princesse minde might please. Full many a suite in broken sighes, God wot, Was offered there, yet all could not appease His kindled ire, who by this easie baite Thought now or neuer on the Queene to sease That had so often made him sound retraite. It fell that foure and twenty Pages were Appoynted on the Reuelers to waite, Who two by two, before each paire should beare, The linkes aloft, and for the greater showe, Like suites to them and vizards also weare. The wily god that all this did foreknow, By putting on the person of a page, Made vp the compt, his quiuer and his bowe To buy a visard which he layd to gage; But turned into a blazing torch his brand. A pretty strippling, much about the age Of fourteene yeares he seem'd when he did stand Among the rest. Now was it time to sup: So costly nothing was by sea or land But it was had, while still the frothy Cup Did haste to deale about the lusty wine. When all was ended, and the boord was vp, In heau'n aboue the starres began to shine: Where also burned Cithere the bright, To Cupid nodding, who knewe well the signe. And like an other heau'n with starry light, Adorn'd was all the Presence round about, That into day againe did turne the night, Although the cheefest light was yet without. With this the trumpets lo began to sound, And eke the multitude aloude to shout, (That all the roome did eu'n againe rebound, Reecchoing no particle amis) God saue your Grace, &amp; God your foes confound. To some her hand of snowe she gaue to kis, She talk'd with other, and gaue thanks to all, Along the chamber as the manner is. Behold how many fiery sparkles small, The Moone about her siluer orbe doth spend, When Hesperus the Euening foorth doth call: So many glorious ladies glad to tend Vpon the Queene vnto her princely State, Downe to the ground before her Grace did bend. As there in Maiesty awhile she Sate With shamefac'd lookes lowe fix'd vpon the ground Loe three faire damsels fal'ne at foule debate, And them before a Trumpet hard to sound. The Damsells dreast in white and blew and blacke Were asked, whence they were, and whither bound? Whom they did looke for, or what they did lacke? Awhile they paus'd, and oft they changed hew, The one still to the other looking backe, Till she, that all appareld was in blew Stept foorth at last, and making Curt'sy low Beganne aloud. Most Mightie Queene, to you In humble manner we present this showe A silly Maide, a Widow, and a Wife, As by our habits you may partly know. Alate betwene vs hapned heauy strife, Whether the Wife, the Widow, or the Maide Liues the most happy and contented life? All what we could, we three therin haue said, And women (as men clatter) want no words. Yet heere (alas) the matter hath not staide, For acted it must needs be by the swords Of Martialists, but your Maiestike hand, That vnto misers mercy still affoords, The same by your authority with stand; Which is so soueraigne, and doth carry weight With all the mighty Sprites of the land, That ended all this sturre will heere be streight. Eight hardy Squiers doe holde of Maidenhead, (Whereof is Owen Tudyr chiefe) and eight Maintaine that it much better is to wed, The last eight by like arguments approue The life sequestred from the nuptiall bed. Renouned Empresse, then let pitty moue Your royall breast to saue them from the spoile, What heart of yron hath she that doth loue To see one man in fight an other soile? Or once abide to see the blood to streame That in the manly bosome wonts to boile? Heereat, as one awak'd out of a dreame, The softly sighing Queene vp started soone, Guilding the world with such a glorious Beame As doth the Sunne this Hemispheare by noone, With morning showrs though somewhat ouerspred: Or, as when in some misty night the Moone Breaks through the clouds, and shews her siluer head. And thus she spake. Ye vertuous Maid and Wife, (For such ye seeme) and thou whose halfe is dead, Whose other halfe resolues to leade the life That also doth thy Queene; not all this Ile A fitter one could yeeld to stint your strife, Extended out though it lie many a mile, And, but the Sea, abides not any bound. For all three courses haue I knowne awhile. A very Maide of me King Henry found, (Whose soule God pardon, and to mercie take) To whom my loue my faith kept euer sound, That all the world my honour might not shake, Ne wracke my fame against so foule a shelfe. As vnto him, so for his onely sake I will remaine no lesse true to my selfe: For Henries Wife and Widow will I die. Honours, vaine pleasures, transitory pelfe, I force not of such gawdes a whit, not I: Yet doth this trash the mindes of many tempt To Loues delights, from whose vile tyranny Princes, no more then other, are exempt. But onely him I lou'd, so doe I now, And euer shall, of whom both thought and dreamt I haue so oft, that no man else may bow My setled heart: onely (were he aliue) He might perhaps preuaile against my vow. And God I begge it now, so let me thriue, If aught I speake the worlds good word to woo Beyond my worth, but with his thunder driue Mee quicke those vgly shades of hell into, Before, O shamefastnes, that I forsake Thee, or yet any lawe of thine vndoe. Might I with me my little Henry take To some remote and solitary denne; Your noble Prince, his seruant God him make, (Whereto the people cried Amen, Amen) I could be well content no more to come Among the prease and multitudes of men. Not that I doubt but vertuous there be some, I know there be, and many in this place. This of my speech then is the very summe; That oft alone when I recount my case, No life me thinkes is like to widdowhoode, So God but guide it with his holy grace. Heereat the Maide and Wife astoned stoode. Mistake me not, quoth then the louely Queene, For often hath it beene no lesse a good To marry wel, then to liue singly seene. Perhaps the more, if heart as well as hands Be rightly tied the married paire betweene: Not altogether wedded vnto lands, Ne wealthy dowres: ah, neuer may she thriue, That on the purse aboue the party stands. She that so weds (as I know none that did) Beguiles her husband, he hath but the hiue, Another eates the hony. God forbid That euer any courtly Dame should carry A heart so base within her bosome hid. As for my selfe, had I not lou'd my Harry, Perdy I make a vow, that for my part No kingdome could haue tempted me to marry Against the loue and liking of my hart. But ah, not long had I enioyed my Ioy When vgly Death comes stealing with his dart, (For hand of man could neuer him annoy) And him of life, and me of loue depriues. Yet hath he left behinde a princely boy, That in my breast his heau'nly shape reuiues. So like the father doth he daily grow, As any you haue seene in all your liues, Yea like him hee already learnes to goe: So would he bend the browe, so would he looke, His eies his hands, he cast he carried so. But whither haue I like a wandring brooke Thus err'd by loue? Few liquid pearles then gusht From out her eies, and there her breath she tooke. But (Lord) then how the louely Virgine blusht, When all the people did the Queene pursue With fresh applauses; till, when all was hush'd, The Queene did her continued speech renew. Ladies it seemes (and therewithall she sate) It seemes I say to vs, that each of you So pleased is with her peculiar state, That all the world may not your wills reclaime. Me leuer also weare your loue then hate, Whereat no vertuous Prince did euer aime. Tyranny feare, and feare this hate begot. What duety then can want a priuy maime That of the subiectes loue proceedeth not? I then conclude, no kinde of life amis That is so fixt, and alters not a iot: Vnhappy most, the least resolued is, When as the great Commander in the warres Affects the Marchants life, the Marchant his, Who knowes each crooked motion of the starres, The Clerke againe enuies the Courtier, And he the Clowne. To leaue particulars In vs, and you, (for oft thus one may erre) I must (I hope to none of your disgrace) Together when all courses I conferre, Of force define, that both resigne the place To maidenhead, as Copper doth, or Brasse, When Indy Gold their glory doth deface. A worthy wife no doubt Susanna was, Redeem'd from death, as she was thereto led: Yet did the widdow Iudith her surpasse; Who smote off, as he breath'd his last abed, That horrid head, yet breathing warre and lust. But vnto Mary well of Maidenhead, This, and that other yeeld of duty must. The Maide where three times three months did repose The Sunne, in whom reposde is all my trust. A virgin is but eu'n a very Rose, For once if hand of man thereon be laide, Both sent and colour it will quickly lose, So tender in the bloome is eu'ry Maide. That innocent and euer happy state (Had our forefathers not so fondly straide) Wherein God humane nature did create In holy maidenhead resembled is, Whence hauing falne too soone, we grieue too late: When all the world doth point at our amis, Then see we naked shame with open eies. Yea maidenhead goes farre beyond all this. For in that earthly place of paradise, As heere we doe, they did by Gods behest: But in that heau'n where his owne owner lies, As are his Angells, such are all the rest; Maides and vnmarried: heere then I conclude That Maidenhead of all is only best. And as she saide, so saide the multitude. Then all three Ladies (who did now relent And pardon aske that they had beene so rude) Besought the night in sportes might now be spent, Whom so to doe with many thankes she praide. So they vnto the foure and twenty sent To certifie them what the Queene had saide, And therewithall to bid them haste away. The messenger so did, and they obaide. Alacke for pitty now what shall I say? A wily traitor and a very thiefe, That all the while in ambush closely lay, Among the Maskers is become the chiefe: And to the Castle is already come, Good Queene, I feare me to thy further griefe. Herewith was heard the Trumpet and the Drum, As if they had beene marching for the field: By two and two they entred all and some Each after other offering vp his shield, While she, that in all curtsie did abound, To euery man particular thankes did yeeld. The softer musicke then beganne to sound, And eke the Ladies were had out to dance: It also pleasde the Queene to walke a round, The Courtly sportes the more to countenance, With whom (bicause he did the Measures leade) To couple it was Owens happy chance. Then all in order gan it softly treade Vp and downe, in and out: the planets seauen, Rapt with harmonious spheres (as we may reade) So daunce about the lofty pole of heauen. The Measures ended, it grewe very late, (For it was halfe an houre nigh past eleauen.) Then bade the Queene, that one belowe the State, A stoole for her should set vpon the ground: This done, anone downe therevppon she sate, Some in their cinqueapase did nimbly bound, Some did the Cros-point, some high Capers cut, And on the toe some other turned round, While still the Minstrell on the trembling gut, Stroue with diuision to outrunne the time That hasted on the Reuells vp to shut, (For midnight now the clock began to chime.) Then issued Owen out among the rest, Reserued vntill then as only prime Of all the Maskers, and the very best. Love that did all the while no wile forsloe, That holp to sett afire her snowy brest, Resolu'd at last, that it must needs be so. Wherefore, as Owen did his galliard daunce, And grac'd it with a turne vpon the toe; (Whether his eyes aside he chaunc'd to glaunce, And like the louely God became so blinde, Or else perhaps it were his happy chaunce, I knowe not, and record none can I finde) This is the shorte; The Queene being very nigh, He fell, and (as he forwarde downe declinde) His knee did hit against her softer thigh. I hope hee felt no great hurt by the fall, That happy fall which mounted him so high. For vp he quickly sprang, and therewithall He fetch'd me such a frisk aboue the ground, That, O well doone, cried out both great and small. The Queene arose then, and dealt thanks around To all of them, but vnto Owen most: The Trumpets also they began to sound, For on she passt, and after her an hoast Of louely ladies, while the people praied, That God would guide her with his holy ghost. Thus all the Court was very well apaide, And euery dauncer in delight did swimme, But Owen onely, who was so dismaide, That all the Company came to comfort him. Amongst all, one wisht it had beene his happe: I can not blame him, though he lost a lim, That long'd to pitch in such a princely lappe. But out alas, what shall theremore be saide? This was but eu'n an engine and a trappe, That for the seely foule was lately laide: The fairest foule I weene that euer was, This onely tricke so fowly hath betraide. As into some one centre of the glasse The Sunny beames we doe contract to light Diuine Tabacco, that all balme doth passe, Because all vnion hath the greater might: So fierce Cupido causde his fiery brand Vpon that Eagle-eye of his to light; That in the very turning of a hand, Reflected it might set afire her heart, That obstacles none might it once withstand. The wound did at the first not greatly smart, For it was inward, and there softly bled Feeding the fire, till (hauing got apart) Her yuory body laide in yuory bed, She there afresh of all beganne to thinke (For idle fancies there be soonest fed) And vnawares let Loue in softly sinke Betweene the lillies of her louely brest. What should she doe? she could not sleepe a wink, Nor any respite take, nor any rest, Nor once but dreame (for how can one awake?) That in was got such an vnruly guest. Which on the gods behalfe did greatly make. It was the very dead of drowsy night, When euery creature else his ease did take But onely yong Queene Katharine the bright, Whose eies (like two faire Diamonds set in rings,) Awak'd her outward little world to light. For vgly night with her broade Rauen-wings Had ouerhild the golden goodly face, As well of heauenly as of earthly things, And the dull humour powred downe apace On weary miserable mortall men: Loe, then beganne her eyes first to embrace An easie slumber: her deuotions then She softly sigh'd, and Requiem also saide, For her deere Lord; thus (hauing breath'd Amen, And softer cheeke vpon soft pillow laide) Fell fast asleepe: who then but Cupid sung? Who laugh'd, who danc'd, or half such herods plaid? For here and there the fire about he flung, As did in Ætna his supposed Sire: That where before she was but only stung A little in the fancie with desire, And quickely might haue cur'd the same againe (Had she but vsde the meanes:) his raging fire Diffusde the venim now through eu'ry vaine. As Elementar fire doth closely creepe Betweene some plankes the greater height to gaine, Not daring out of his blinde Cell to peepe, Before alas (as oft it doth befall) The goodman of the house be fast asleepe: Then opposition finding none at all, About the Noone of night inuades the sparres, And many hundred thousand sparkles small, About the welkin hurls to mocke the starres: At last in smoaky flames it chokes the skies, And of the building all the beauty marres, Or once the Owner halfe can ope his eyes. O mercy God, O Loue, O Charity, What is this heate, or how doth it arise? Is it begot but of a wanton eye, And so conceiued in a gentle hart? If it be so, then aske I reason why? Thy selfe, O Loue, of eyes depriued art? But if by fatall reuolution Of any starre, O god thou guide thy dart (Sith that we know the certaine motion Of euery Starre in heau'n, both her degree, Her opposition, and coniunction, With euery other hidden qualitie, Portending what is likeliest to befall) Reueale, O God, reueale thou vnto me That am thy Priest (though worthy least of all) So long haue I rebel'd against thy law, Blaspheming it as ceremonial, Enacted onely fooles to keepe in awe: Yet sith I doe recant my folly now That into danger youth might haply draw, Reueale the reason, and the cause, why thou In all thy deedes so diuerse euer art; And doe, I pray, instruct thy Prophet, how In euery pageant thou dost play thy part, Prouoking here to loue and there to lust. Why should a Lady like with all her hart (Her selfe borne vnder Ioue and Venus iust) A tawny face befurd with sable haire, Borne vnder old Saturnus starre combust? What appetite the foule hath to the faire Is euident, for euery seely soule Knowes with perfection how things long to paire: But that the faire should stoope vnto the foule, A wonder it doth seeme to me no lesse Then if an Eagle should vnto an Owle. Yet more may be then I can haply gesse, I might be numbred eighth among the Wise, If all to know my selfe I should professe. Is it because that in faire womens eyes Blacke men seeme pearles (and women all iwis Would be: or else, which doth aswell suffice, Reputed faire?) or is it haply this, That any beauty layde against the blacke, Of much more beautie and more brightnes is? Is it because we like (though nought we lacke) What other haue? or else because this hue Lends liuelier heate and moisture to the backe? Why should a Queene to whom so many sue, So many Princes would be prowde to serue, Bid all the glittering pompe of Court a due, And to a priuate loue her sweets reserue? Why should she spend with him her happy dayes, That hardly doth to serue her but deserue? This is thy power, O Loue, this is thy praise, For vnto Gods it only doth belong The mighty downe to pull, the meeke to raise; Thou findest likes, or else ere it be long, Thou framest such of sundry qualities: It is then open and no petty wrong, To charge thee so with incongruities: For onely thou alone in all thy deedes, As at the first yet work'st by contraries. Whenas together all the sundry seedes Of vndigested Chaos did conspire To mould the body that so many breedes: The Earth, the Aire, the Water and the Fire, (For each was vnto either deadly foe) To sundry rankes did all at once retire: The leight got vp, the heauy stay'd below, The Sea did start aside to show the land, The windes did on the billowes stifly blowe All which be now tied in so friendly band, As they may not beyond their limits range, And this was done by thy Almighty hand. Nor art thou Lord (for all thou seeme so strange) Yet halfe so mutable as any man: But as resolued and vnapt to change, As at the day when first the world began. Perhaps by some to scorne I shall be laught For holding so, say all they what they can, This is the truth, thus other shall be taught: Yea (though therefore I should be tortured) I would not alter any word for aught, For all is right, if it be rightly read.
