Al day with ene sene Ã¾ou has Hou men bene slayne fore dedle synne, And han vengans fore here trespace; BoÃ¾ lyue and goodes Ã¾ay lesyn Ã¾en Bi londys law. ?if Ã¾ai had kept Cristis comanndment, Ãai schuld neuer be schamyd ne chent, Ne lost here lyfe, ne lond, ne rent, NouÃ¾er hongud ne draw. Hel is not ordent fore ry?twyse me[n], Bot fore hom Ã¾at here seruen Ã¾e fynd; No more ys a preson of lyme and ston Bot to hom Ã¾at Ã¾e lauys Ã¾ai done offend, Fore wyckyd dedys makys Ã¾euys i-schent, Hye on galouys fore to heng. Ãe ry?twyse men Ã¾ai han god end, Fore Ã¾ay bene treue in here leuyng, Trust wel Ã¾er-to. He Ã¾at leuys here ry?twysly, On what deÃ¾ Ã¾at euer he dy, His soul neuer schal ponyschyd be, Ne neuer wyt of wo. Ãe syn of sodom into heuen, Hit crys euer on God almy?t, And monsla?t with a rewful steuen, Hit askys vengans day and ny?t; Extorcyons a?ayns Ã¾e ry?t, And huyrus Ã¾at with wrong holdon be, Damnacion to ham hit is y-dy?t Ãat vsyn Ã¾ese, and avowtere, Euerychon. Ãese synnys a mon Ã¾ai done blynde, Fore Ã¾ai be don a?ayns kynde, And bene Ã¾e werkys of Ã¾e fynde Of damnacion. Ãre synns princypaly a man doÃ¾ mare, MurÃ¾yr, Ã¾euft, and avoutre; Ãai wyl ?ou schend ore ?e be ware, Be Ã¾ai done neuer so preuely; Ãe fynd wyl schew ham hopunly, Ãat al Ã¾e word schal haue wyttyng, Fore Ã¾ai bene cursyd in heuen on hye. Ale Ã¾at vsus Ã¾at cursid doyng, Ãai wyl be schent. Fore morÃ¾er, Cayme cursud of God was he, And fore Ã¾eft, Ã¾euys al day hongud Ã¾ay be; Fore avoutre, vengans had kyng Daue, Fore brekyng of Ã¾e sacrement. Avowtre ne lechory men set not by, To breke Ã¾e bond of Ã¾e sacreme[n]t; Ãay schul aby ful sekyrly, Bot Ã¾ai haue spase ham to repent. Here-fore, ?e curatis, ?e wyl be schent And prestis Ã¾at bene lewyd in here leuyng, Fore to Ã¾is syn ?e done asent With euyl ensampyl to oÃ¾er ?eueng; And wretyn hit ys ?e were choson to chastyte, To kepe ?our holy order and ?our degre In parfyt loue and charite, And mend ale oÃ¾er Ã¾at done amys. Kepe ?oure wedloke, ?e weddid men; In paradyse God furst hit mad Betwene Adam and Eue with trew loue Ã¾en, BoÃ¾ mon and womon Ã¾er-with to glad; Ãer-with He is boÃ¾ plesud and payd ?if hit be kept laufully. Hymselfe was borne of a mayde To fulfyl Ã¾at sacrement princypaly; Into herÃ¾ he come To make Ã¾er eyrus of heuen blys, Ãat Lucefyr lost and al hys; Monkynd schal hit a?ayne encrese Or Ã¾e day of dome. Nou ?if a woman maryd schal be, Anoon sche schal be bo?t and sold; Hit is fore no loue of hert treuly Bot fore couetyse of lond or gold. Ãis is Goddis wyle and His lau wolde, Euan of blood, euan good, euan of age, Fore loue to-geder Ã¾us cum Ã¾ai schalde, Fore Ã¾es makus metely maryage Here in al-wyse. Ãai schal haue ayrs ham betwene Ãat schal haue grace to Ã¾ryue and Ã¾ene; Ãer oÃ¾er schul haue turment and tene Fore couetyse. Ãer is no cryatour, as wreton Y fynde, Saue only mon Ã¾at doÃ¾ outrage; Ãai chesun here makus of here houne kynd, With treu loue makun here mareage. Nou a lade wyl take a page Fore no loue bot fore fl[e]schely lust, And al here blood dysparage; Ães lordys and lordchips Ã¾ay ben i-lost In mone a place. Lordys and lorchypus Ã¾ay wastyn away, Ãat makys false ayris, hit is no nay, And wele and worchyp fore euer and ay, Onour and grace. Now ?if Ã¾at a man he wed a wyfe And hym Ã¾ynke sche plese hym no?t, Anon Ã¾er rysis care and stryfe; He wold here selle Ã¾at he had bo?t, And schenchypus here Ã¾at he haÃ¾ so?t, And takys to hym a lotoby. Ãese bargeyn wyle be dere a-bo?t; Here ore henns he schal aby; He is foresworne. When he as chosyn hyr to his make, And ply?t here trowÃ¾ to here y-take, Hy schuld neuer here foresake, Euen ne morne. A?ayns ale Ã¾is remedy I fynde: Foresake ?oure syn, Y ?ou pray; To God and mon loke ?e be kynde, To heuen Ã¾er is [no] noÃ¾er way, And make amendis wyle Ã¾at ?e may. ?if ?e wyl haue remyssyon, God ?e most boÃ¾ plese and pay, Or ellus haue damnacion. Wyle ?e han space, Ãus gracyously says Ã¾e Kyng of blys, ?eff ?e wyl mend Ã¾at ?e do mysse, Nolo mortem peccatoris, ?e schul haue grace. In what order or what degre Hole cherche haÃ¾ bound Ã¾e to, Kepe hit wel, I counsel Ã¾e; Dyssyre Ã¾ou neuer to go Ã¾er-fro, Fore Ã¾ou art boundon go were Ã¾ou goo. When Ã¾ou hast ressayu[e]d Ã¾e sacrement Ãer is no mon may hit vndoo, Bot he be cursid verament. In Ã¾e gospel Ã¾ou sist, Ãat God be law byndus y-fyre, Ãer is no mon Ã¾at haÃ¾ pouere Hit to vndo in no manere, Bot he be curst. Loue ?our God ouer al Ã¾yng, ?oure ne?bore as ?ourselfe, as I ?ou saye; Let be ?oure oÃ¾is, ?oure false sweryng; In clannes kepe ?oure haleday; ?oure fader, ?oure moder worchip ay; Sle no mon fore wordle Ã¾yng; Bakbyte no mon ny?t ne day, Ne say no word to hym sklaunderyng; False wytnes loke Ã¾ou non bere; Dysseyte ne Ã¾eft loke Ã¾ou do non, And lechory Ã¾ou most foreswere; Here beÃ¾ Ã¾e comaundmentis euerychon; Loke ?e kepe hem wele. I rede ?e seruen heuen Kyng, Fore ane loust or lykyng, Haue mynd apon ?oure endyng, Of Ã¾e payns of helle. AnoÃ¾er remede ?et Ã¾er is; Gentyl seres, herkens to me, Ãe vij werkys of merce, so haue I blys, I wyl declare ham oponle; Ãai schul be schewed ful petuysly At domysday, at Cristis cumyng; Ãer God and mon present schal be, And al Ã¾e world on fuyre brenny[n]g, A reuful aray. Ãen wele is hym and wele schal be Ãat doÃ¾ Ã¾ese werkys with pete; He schal haue grace and merce On domysday. Ãe hungre ?if mete; Ã¾e Ã¾orste ?if dryng; CleÃ¾ Ã¾e nakyd, as I Ã¾e say; Vysyte Ã¾e seke in preson lying, And bere Ã¾e ded, as I Ã¾e pray, And herbere Ã¾e pore Ã¾at goÃ¾ be Ã¾e way, And teche Ã¾e vnwyse of Ã¾i cunny[n]g. Do Ã¾ese werkys, boÃ¾ ny?t and day, To Goddis worchip and His plesyng; Ãis is His wylle. Euer haue Ã¾is in Ã¾i mynd; To Ã¾e pore loke Ã¾ou be kynd, Ãen in heuen Ã¾ou schalt hit fynd, Ãou schalt neuer spyle.

Ellys a mon he were vnablle, As a best ys of kynd, Bott mon ys made resnabyle, Good and euyl to haue in his mynd, And has fre choys, as we fynde, Weder he wyl do good or ylle, OwÃ¾er y-sauyd or ellys y-schent, OwÃ¾er haue heuen or ellus haue helle, Ãou hast fre choys. Ãen I red foresake Ã¾e fynd; To God and mon loke Ã¾ou be kynd, And haue His passyon in Ã¾i mynd, Ãat dyed on cros.

Ãe pore schul be made domysmen Apon Ã¾e ryche at domysday; Let se houe Ã¾ai cun onswere Ã¾en For al here ryal, reuerent aray; In hunger, in cold, in Ã¾urst, weleaway, Afftyr here almes ay waytyng, Ãay wold not vysete vs ny?t ne day; Ãus wyl Ã¾ai playn ham to heuen Kyng, Ãat is aboue. Ãus we dydon myschyvysly; Fore hungyr and Ã¾urst ful petuysly Ãai nold not on us haue no pete, Ny for Ã¾ai loue. 2 De concordia inter rectores fratres et rectores ecclesie. God haÃ¾ grauntyd grace vnto oure lerny[n]g, Al Ã¾at we fynden fayfully wrytyn in hole wryt, Ãat be our pacyens princypaly, and holy wrytyng, We schuld haue consolacion and comford, byleue truly in hyt. I schal say ?ou Ã¾e soÃ¾, Ã¾at wele schul ?e wyt, Hit is Godys word, and His werke, and His worchyng; Be Ã¾e grace of Ã¾e Hole Gost to-gedyr hit is y-knyt, Redle vs to remembyr in oure redyng And hold hit in mynde. Ãer is no mon Ã¾at saued may be But he haue fayÃ¾e, hope, and charite, And do as Ã¾ou woldust me dud by Ã¾e, To God and men be kynde. Hec est fides catholyca. Ãis foreward furst we mad at Ã¾e fontston, To-fore owre fader fayÃ¾fely Ã¾at folowed vs in fay, To forsake Syr Sathanas his werkus euerychon, And become Cristen men, to byleue in God veray, And kepe His comawndmentis kyndly ny?t and day. Ãer we were croysid in a crysum with a carful krye; To Ã¾is couenant was callud to wytnes, Y say, Oure godfars, oure godmoders, to stond Ã¾er vs by; When we my?t not speke, Ãer Ã¾ai answerd fore vs, In Ã¾e name of Ihesus, Al Ã¾re with one woys; Ãis bond we schuld no?t breke. Time Dominum et mandata serua. Hwo-so brekys Ã¾is bond, bare Ã¾ai bene of blys; Bot Ã¾ai ben saluyd of here syn or Ã¾ai hense passe, Ãai schulu[n] wytt of wo, Y warne ?oue y-wys; Hit schal be ponyschid here ore hennus euere trespasse; Men haue not Ã¾is in mynd nowÃ¾er more ne lasse.

As Ã¾ou were marter and mayd clene, Ãer-for Ã¾ou hadist turment and tene; A princes loue Ã¾ou my?tis haue bene, A lady of ryal aray. Bot to Ã¾at syn Ã¾ou woldist no?t sent; To kepe Ã¾e chast was Ã¾yn entent, Ãer-fore of Cradoc Ã¾ou wast e-chent; Anon he Ã¾o?t Ã¾e to betray. He was ful cursid and cruel, And dred not God ne no parel; Smot of Ã¾i hede; Ã¾ou knelist ful stil; Hit ran into a dry valay. Ãen Bewnou, Ã¾i nunkul, with gret pete, Set Ã¾i hede to Ã¾i body; Ãou leuedust after merwesly Xv ?ere; hit is no nay. About Ã¾i nek hit was e-sene, Ãe stroke of Ã¾e swerd Ã¾at was so kene, A Ã¾red of perle as hit had bene, Hit besemyd Ã¾e wel, soÃ¾le to say. When Cradoc ha[d] don Ã¾is cursid dede, Ãe erÃ¾ him swoloud in Ã¾at stede; Ãe foyre of hel hit was his mede, Ãer-in to be fore euer and ay. A wonderful wel Ã¾er sprong anon, Seche on se neuer Cristyn mon; Ãi blod was sparpild on euere stone; No water my?t wasche hit away. Ãer ben mesis at Ã¾at wel, Ãat bene swete and sote of smel, And ?et Ã¾er is a more maruel, Heuenle bryddis in immens aray. Be Ã¾e streme of Ã¾at fayre wel Ãer went a myl, as I ?ou tel; Hit bere down a child with gret parel; Ãe wele stod stil, mi?t not away. Ãen Ã¾e moder cryd out and ?eld, âAlas! my child he is spillid.â Be Ã¾e ladlis he him huld, And lo? and mad gomun and play. A mon a grote downe he felle Out of his hond into Ã¾e well; He se hit Ã¾en al oÃ¾er wel; Ãai my?t not tak Ã¾e grote away. Also Ã¾er was a gret maruel; Wyne was couchid in here chapel; Ãe wel stod styl, ran neuer a del; Hit trobild as hit had bene with clay. Ãer was no fuyre, treule to tele, My?t hete Ã¾e water of Ã¾e wel, To seÃ¾ ne dy?t no vetel, Wile Ã¾at wyne in Ã¾at chapil lay. Ãen Ã¾ai west wel a-fyne Of Wynfryd hit was a syne; Anon Ã¾ai hurled out Ã¾e wyne Into Ã¾e stret on dele way. Anon a merekel fel in Ã¾at plas; A mon of Ã¾at wyne enpoysund was, Ãat was sauyd Ã¾ro? Godis grace, And Wynfryd, Ã¾at hole may. Anon Ã¾is wel began to clere; Ãe streme ran forÃ¾ as hit dede ere; Ãe p[lu]mys Ã¾ai mad a hedus bere, When Ã¾ai began to play. Fore ?e chuld make no marchandyse In hole cherche, in no wyse; God himselue He ded dispyse, And drof hom forÃ¾ in here aray. Fore hit is a house of prayore, Hold hile to Godis honour, To worchip Ã¾er-in our Saueour With mas, matens, ny?t and day. Ãer haÃ¾ ben botynd mone a mon, Blynd and crokid, Ã¾at my?t not gon, Seke and sorouful mone hone, Ãer at Ã¾at wel there hur heed lay. Ãen Wynfred anon chorun che was, E-chosun fore chefe to be abbas, Fol of vertu and of grace, And seruyd God boÃ¾ ny?t and day. Ãen Bewnow toke his leue anon, And betoke here Ã¾is tokyn, Ouer Ã¾e se schal swem a stone To bryng vestementis, Ã¾er ys noo nay. ?if Ã¾at stone abyde with Ã¾e, Ãen wit wel Ã¾at I schal dye; God of my soule He haue mercy; Haue mynde on me Ã¾e[n], I Ã¾e pray. Ãen Wenfred heo knelid adowne, And toke mekele his benesoune; Ãis monke he toke his way anon Ouer Ã¾e se to his abbay. When Ã¾at Bewnew he was dede, Ãe ston styl with here hit leuyd; Ãen anon heo prayud, He schul pas on his chornay. Son after Wenefred heo dyid Ã¾en, At Schrosbere men dedon here schryne; Mone a merakil Ã¾er haÃ¾ be syne, Of dyuers pepul in fer cuntre. Mone a merakil heo haÃ¾ e-do, Presonars feters i-broke a-two, Blynd and crokid helid mone mo, Ãat were in rewful aray. Glad mai be al Schrosbere To do reuerens to Ã¾at lady; Ãai seche here grace and here mercy On pilgrymage Ã¾er euere Fryday. Wynfrede, we Ã¾e beseche, Now ry?t with herfilly speche, Ãat Ã¾ou wilt be our soulis leche, Ãe to serue, boÃ¾ plese and pay. We prayn Ã¾e al Ã¾at beÃ¾ present, Saue Ã¾yn abbay and Ã¾i couent, Ãat Ã¾ai be neuer chamyd ne chent, With wykkid mon, ne fyndis [f]ray. I pray ?oue al pur charyte Redis Ã¾is carol reuerently, Fore I hit mad with wepyng ye; Mi name hit is Ã¾e blynd Awdlay. 25 Hic incipit salutacio Sancte Wenefrede virginis. Hayle!

His gracious granseres and his grawndame, His fader and moderis of kyngis Ã¾ay came; Was neuer a worÃ¾ear prynce of name, So exelent in al our day. His fader fore loue of mayd Kateryn, In Fraunce he wro?t turment and tene; His loue hee sayd hit schuld not ben, And send him ballis him with to play. Ãen was he wyse in wars with alle, And ta?t Franchemen to plai at Ã¾e balle; With tenes hold he ferd ham halle; To castelles and setis Ã¾i floyn away. To Harflete a sege he layd anon, And cast a bal vnto Ã¾e towne; Ãe Frenchemen swere be se and sun, Hit was Ã¾e fynd Ã¾at mad Ã¾at fray. Anon Ã¾ai toke ham to cownsele; Oure gracious kyng Ã¾ai wold asayle; At Agyncowrt at Ã¾at patayle, Ãe floure of Frawnce he fel Ã¾at day. Ãe kyng of Frawns Ã¾en was agast; Mesagers to him send in hast, Fore wele he west hit was bot wast Hem to witstond in hone way. And prayd hym to sese of his outrage, And take Kateryn to mareage; Al Frawnce to him schuld do homage, And croune him kyng afftyr his day. Of Frawnce he mad him anon regent, And wedid Kateren in his present; Into Englond anon he went, And cround our quene in ryal aray. Of quen Kateryn our kyng was borne, To saue our ry?t Ã¾at was forelorne, Oure faders in Frawns had won befor[n]e; Ãai han hit hold mone a day. Ãus was his fader a conqueroure, And wan his moder with gret onoure; Now may Ã¾e kyng bere Ã¾e floure Of kyngis and kyngdams in vche cuntre. On him schal fal Ã¾e prophece, Ãat haÃ¾ ben sayd of Kyng Herre, Ãe hole cros wyn or he dye, Ãat Crist halud on Goodfryday. Al wo and werres he schal a-cese, And set alle reams in rest and pese, And turne to Cristyndam al heÃ¾ynes; Now grawnt him hit so be may. Pray we Ã¾at Lord is Lord of alle To saue our kyng his reme ryal, And let neuer myschip vppon him falle, Ne false traytoure him to betray. I pray ?oue, seris, of ?our gentre, Syng Ã¾is carol reuerently, Fore hit is mad of Kyng Herre; Gret ned fore him we han to pray. ?if he fare wele, wele schul we be, Or ellis we may be ful sore, Fore him schal wepe mone an e; Ãus prophecis Ã¾e blynd Awdlay. 40 Fac ad quod venisti.

A frere schuld loue alle holenes, Prayers, penans, and pouert[e]; Relegious men, Crist hem ches To foresake pride and vaynglory, I say al gate vt supra. An hold mon schuld kepe him chast, And leue Ã¾e synne of lechore; Al wedid men schuld be stedfast, And foresake Ã¾e syn of avowtre; I sai al gate vt supra. A kny?t schuld fe?t a?ayns falsnes, And schew his monhod and his my?t, And mayntene trouÃ¾ and ry?twysnes, And hole cherche and wedowes ry?t; I say al gate vt supra. Here be al Ã¾e foure astatis, In hole cherche God haÃ¾ ordent; He bedis ?ou kepe hem wel al gate, Wos[o]euer he chomys he wyl be schent; I say al gate vt supra. 41 Cantalena de puericia. And God wold graunt me my prayer, A child a?ene I wold I were. Fore pride in herte he hatis all one; Worchip ne reuerens kepis he non; Ne he is wroÃ¾ with no mon; In charete is alle his chere. He wot neuer wat is envy; He wol vche mon fard wele him by; He couetis no?t vnlaufully, Fore chere stons is his tresoure. In hert he hatis lechori, To here Ã¾er-of he is sory; He sleÃ¾ Ã¾e syn of glotere, NoÃ¾er etis ne drynkis bot fore mystere. SlouÃ¾ he putis away al gate, And wol be bese erle and late; Al wyckidnes Ã¾us he doÃ¾ hate, Ãe vij dedle synns al in-fere. A gracious lyfe forsoÃ¾e he has; To God ne mon doÃ¾ no trespas, And I in syn fal, alas, Euere day in Ã¾e ?ere. My ioy, my myrÃ¾ is fro me clene; I turne to care, turment, and tene; Ded I wold Ã¾at I had bene, When I was borne, and layd on bere. Fore better hit were to be vnboren, Ãen fore my synus to be forelorne, Nere grace of God Ã¾at is beforne, Almysdede and hole prayere Now oÃ¾er cumford se I non Bot schryue me clene with contricion, And make here trew satisfaccion, And do my penans wyle Y am here. 42 In die epephanis &amp;c. Nowel! nowel! nowel! Ãer is a Babe born of a may In saluacion of vs; Ãat He be heryd in Ã¾is day, Vene Creatore Spiritus.

There is a Floure spr[u]ng of a tre, Ãe rote Ã¾er-of is callid Iesse; A Floure of pryce, Ãer is non seche in paradise! Ãis Flour is fayre and fresche of heue; Hit fadis neuer bot euer is new; Ãe blisful branche Ã¾is Flour on grew Was Mare myld Ã¾at bare Ihesu. A Flour of grace, A?ayns al sorow hit is solas!

When Gabrael Ã¾is mayd met, With âAue Mariaâ he here gret; Betwene hem two Ã¾is Flour was set, And kept was, no mon schul wit; Hent on a day In Bedlem hit con spred and spray.

Ãer is a Floure. 45 Et alia de Sancta Maria. Aue Maria, now say we so, Moder and maydon was neuer non mo. Gaude Maria, Cristis moder, Mare, moder of Ã¾yn emne, Ãou bare my Lord; Ã¾ou bare my Broder; Ãou bare a cumle Child and clene; Ãou stodist ful stil without wene, When in Ã¾yn ere Ã¾is erand was doo, When gracious God Ã¾e ly?t within, Gabrielis nuncio. Aue Maria vt supra. Gaude Maria, Y gret with grace. When Ihesu, Ã¾i Sun, of Ã¾e was bore, Fol ny?

And Ã¾e froyt Ã¾at coms hom betwene, Hit schal haue grace to Ã¾ryue and Ã¾e; Ãer oÃ¾er schal haue turment and tene, Fore couetyse vnlaufully; Al day Ã¾ou seest. Ãer is no creatuere, as wretyn I fynd, Saue onele mon Ã¾at [doÃ¾] outtrache, Bot [ch]esyn hom makys of here oune kynd, And so Ã¾ai makyn treu mareache; Alle day Ã¾ou seest. Bot now a lady wil take a page Fore no loue bot fleschele lust, And so here blod is disparage; Ãus lordus and lordchip al day ben lost; Al day Ã¾ou seest. Lordis and lorchip Ã¾us wastyn away In Englond in mone a place; Ãat makis false ayrs hit is no nay, And lese worchip, honowre, and grace; Al day Ã¾ou seest. 50 De amore Dei.

Fore loue is loue and euer schal be, And loue has bene ore we were bore; Fore loue he askys no noÃ¾er fe, Bot loue a?ayn; he kepis no more; I say here-fore. Trew loue is tresoure; trust is store, To a loue to Godis plesyng; Bot leude loue makis men e-lore, To loue here lust and here lykyng; I say here-fore. In good loue Ã¾er is no syn; Witho[u]t loue is heuenes; Here-fore to loue I nyl not bly[n], To loue my God and His goodnes; I say here-fore. For He me louyd or I Him knew, Ãer-fore I loue Him alÃ¾er best, Ellis my loue I my?t hit rew; I loue with Him to take my rest; I say here-fore. Of al loueres Ã¾at euer was borne, His loue hit passid euerechon; Nad He vs louy[d], we were forelorne; With[out] [H]is loue, trew loue is non; I say here-fore. 51 Timor mortis conturbat me. Lade, helpe! Ihesu, merce! Timor mortis conturbat me. Dred of deÃ¾, sorow of syn, Trobils my hert ful greuysly; My soule hit nyÃ¾ with my lust Ã¾en; Passio Christi conforta me.

Saynt Frances, to Ã¾e I say, Saue Ã¾i breder boÃ¾ ny?t and day. A hole confessoure Ã¾ou were hone, And leuydist in contemplacion, To Ã¾yng on Cristis passioun, Ãat sofyrd deÃ¾ on Good Fryday; Saynt Frawnces, to Ã¾e I pray. His passion was in Ã¾e so feruent, Ãat He aperd to Ã¾i present; Vpon Ã¾i body He set His prynt, His v wondis, hit is no nay. Vpon Ã¾i body Ã¾ou hem bere, Affter Ã¾at tyme ful iij ?e[re]; To al men sy?t Ã¾ai did apere; No water my?t wasche hem away. Weder Ã¾ou schuldist ete ore drenke, On Cristis passion Ã¾ou woldist Ã¾ynke; In v partys wes Ã¾i partyng Of His sustinans, soÃ¾e to say. Crist He grawnt Ã¾e specialy, Fore on His passion Ã¾ou hadist pete, To feche Ã¾i breder out of purgatori, Ãat lyin Ã¾er in rewful aray. Ãou Ã¾ongis Crist of His swete sonde, And Ã¾o?tist to go to Ã¾e hole londe, Fore dred of deÃ¾ Ã¾ou woldist not wond, To teche Ã¾e pepil Ã¾i Cristyn fay. Ãen Crist He knew welle Ã¾en entent, And turned Ã¾e out of Ã¾at talent, And bede Ã¾e make Ã¾i testament, And come to me fore ens and ay. A! hole Frawnces, now I se, Fore my loue Ã¾at Ã¾ou woldist dye; Ãou schalt haue ioy perpetual[e], Ãou hast dyssired mone a day. His hole reule of relegiowne To his breder he wrote anon, And prayd ham fore Cristis passiowne, To kepe hit wel boÃ¾ ny?t and day. A sad ensampil here mow ?e se, On Cristis passioun to haue pete, And to leue in loue and charete, Ãen mere in hert be ?e may. His last prayer to Crist Ã¾is was; Fore al Ã¾at sustens Ã¾is hole place, Gr[a]cious God, grawnt ham Ã¾i grace, To-fore Ã¾i iugement at domysday. Pray we to Frawnses Ã¾at beÃ¾ present To saue his breder and his couent, Ãat Ã¾ai be neuer chamyd ne chent, With wyckid man, ne fyndis fray. I pray ?oue, seris, pur charyte, Redis Ã¾is caral reuerently, Fore I mad hit with wepyng eye, ?our broder Ion, Ã¾e blynd Awdlay. 53 Pater noster qui es in celis. The pater noster to expone, may no man hit prise, Ãat of prayers is pris and most fore to prayse; I rede Ã¾ou rede hit a-ry?t and out of syn ryse, Ãat may restyng in heuen vnto Ã¾i soule rayse; Fore seuen poyntis Ã¾er bene in e-set in asyse, Ãe lest salue hyt is to Ã¾e synn as Ã¾e boke sayse. Oure Fader Ã¾e wyche Ã¾ou hart in heuen, Ã¾is oresoune Ã¾ou yse; Ay e-halouyd be Ã¾i name in angyr and in ayse; Sanctificetur nomen tuum, Say whe Ã¾e same, Oure Fader Ã¾e wyche Ã¾ou art in heuen halouyd be Ã¾i name.

The Ã¾rid poynt to expownd Ã¾at is most playne: Let penans perce Ã¾i syn out of Ã¾i soule playne; Ãe foreward at Ã¾e fonston to fulfyl Ã¾ou schuldist be ful fayne, And not in foundyng to be as Ã¾e wederfane, Bot to abyde at his bone and at his bidyng be bayne, BoÃ¾ in bale and in blis abyde at his bane; Ãer-fore his wil to fulfil Ã¾ou schalt Ã¾i soule wayne, And let Ã¾i warlouys werkys out of Ã¾i soule wane. Fiat voluntas tua sicut in celo et in terra, Fulfilde be his wil, Ry?t in erÃ¾ as in heuen with good and with ylle.

Panem nostrum cotidianum da nobis hodie, Our oche days bred, Lord, Ã¾ou reche vs to-day; Ã¾ou art our soulis rede. When Ã¾ou hast fraystud Ã¾e fyrÃ¾, to Ã¾e fyft fare, Ãou schalt hit forÃ¾eron in Ã¾i hert and ful sone i-fere, And cri arde vpon Crist to keuer vs of care, As He was crownyd on Ã¾e croyse, with a voyse clere; And be ware of Ã¾at word Ã¾at Ã¾ou hit wele ware, Ellys vnborne Ã¾at Ã¾ou wore, better Ã¾e were.

Et dimitte nobis debita nostra sicut et nos dimittimus, Fore?if vs our dett debitoribus nostris, As we our detturse fore?ifÃ¾, we bid no bet.
