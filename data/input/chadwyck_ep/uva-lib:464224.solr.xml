      <field name="fulltext">[PHILOMYTHIE], [OR, PHILOMYTHOLOGIE.] A PRÆMONITION TO THE INTELLIGENT READER. Lest hee finding his affection or opinion crost in the praise or dispraise of some particular, should thereby be drawn to reade or reiect the rest with Præiudice. VVho safely in the streame would swim, Must free from weeds keepe euery lym; Lest slaue vnto himselfe he grow, And vulgar humour drawes him low; Or ventring in the deeps (too weake), Opinions windie bladder breake. “We ought both in our selues and friends, “To hate all acts with doubtfull ends; “And loue euen in our foes the good “Which may be seuer'd from their blood. And if the times mislead vs so, To sooth those sinnes we would not do; At least (like free-men) let vs thinke What's good and bad, although we winke. To this free nature if you finde These busie papers much inclinde; Yet pardon them, and iudge aright, A free-man (not a slaue) did write. Reade for your pleasure, close the Booke, On th'innocent outside all may looke. Th'intelligent within may prie: But barre th'Intelligencers eye. Thomas Scot. SARCASMOS MVNDO: OR, The Frontispice explaned. How apt is Man to erre? Antiquitie Thinks it sees right, and yet sees all awry. Our sight is impotent, the helpe we haue By Art-full spectacles, doth much depraue The truth of obiects; And tradition saith Bookes vse to lye, And Bookes deny her faith. Ecclipses of the Sunne were wonders thought, Till sage Milesius the cause out-sought. And man had not the wit to make a doubt Of halfe the world, till fortune found it out. But what this Age hath seene, makes that seeme truth The laughing wiseman wrote, which made the youth Shed teares to reade it; that more worlds remaine Still vndiscouer'd then are yet made plaine. Deepe diuing Paracelsus findes the ground With minerals and mettals to abound; More proper for our humors then the weedes, Hearbs, plants, &amp; flowers, which spring from weaker seeds. This earth we liue on and do stedfast call, Copernicus proues giddy-brainde, and all Those other bodies whose swift motions we So wonder at, he setled finds to be. Till sanctifi'd Ignatius and his brood Found out the lawfull way of shedding blood, And prou'd it plainly that a subiect might Murther his Prince we fondly vsde t'indite Such persons of high treason: Now before them We kneele, we pray, we worship and adore them. For with their merits now w'are more acquainted And know for zealous Patriots they are saincted. His power that doth it, till of late we doubted But now who questions it to death are flouted. Then let what I propound no wonder seeme, Though doting age new truthes do dis-esteeme, For time may make it plaine, and reason too May beare it out, though sure with much adoe. Causes foregoe effects by course of kinde, Yet first th'effect and then the cause we finde. And so much I do here, propound the thing, But stronger reason after-times may bring. Attend my Doctrine then. I say this Earth On which we tread, from whence we take our birth, Is not, as some haue thought proportion'd round, And Globe-like with such zones, and girdles bound, As Poets or (more lyers) Trauellers say, But shap'd awry, and lookes another way. It is a monstrous Creature like a Man, Thrust altogether on a heape, we can Distinguish no part, goggle eyes, wide mouth, Eares that reach both the poles from north to south, Crump-shouldred, breast, &amp; back, &amp; thighs together, The legs and feet all one, if it hath either. In breefe it is the greatest Master Deuill Throwne downe from heauen, in whose wombe euery euill Is radically fixt, and from thence springs Infusing natiue euill, in all such things As it doth breed and nourish. The place of Hell Is in his wombe, there lesser deuils dwell. And when he stirres a limme, or breaketh winde, We call't an earth-quake, and the danger finde. Kings, Emperours, and mighty men that tread In highest state, are lyce vpon his head. The Pope and all his traine are skipping fleas That know no bounds, but leape lands-law and seas, The rest are nits or body-lyce, that craule Out of his sweat, such vermin are we all. From heauen this monster fell, and now doth lye Bruzde with the fall, past all recouery. Neither aliue, nor dead, nor whole, nor sound, Sinking, and swimming, in a sea profound Of sinne, and punishment, of paine, and terror, Of learned ignorance, and knowing error. No wonder then, that we who liue and dye On cursed earth, do all things thus awry, Being monstrous in our manners, and our minds, And mixing in the lust-full change of kinds. That we are full of passions, doubts, and feares, And daily fall together by the eares. No wonder that the Clergie would be Kings, Kings Church-men; Lords and Ladies equall things; So like in painting, spotting, starching, all, That Ladies Lords, and Lords we Madams call. For euen as Hares change shape and sex, some say Once euery yeare; these whores do euery day, So that Hirquittall and his wife were waken By Succubus and Incubus, mistaken. No wonder that Diuines the Parasites play In ieast and earnest; Actors euery way. No wonder that some theeues doe Lawyers proue, Since all these euils by course of nature moue, So farre; that it is question'd 'mongst the wise Which now is vertue, and which now is vice. Two Crookbacks (not the third Dick Gloster, hight, We will haue none of him, for he would fight) Debate this question, each assumes his part. Æsope for vertue stands, and all his art, Is to instruct the world to leaue the sinne, And folly, which it lyes incompast in; Weeps to behold it circled so with vices, Whose serpentine and poysond sting, intices To fading pleasure, and to deadly paine, By vse soone caught, but hardly left againe. He wries his necke at earth; but 'tis to see How out of order euery part will bee. He wills each Reader if my tales be darke, To iudge the best, the morall still to marke. And where they finde a doubtfull meaning, there To hold an eu'n course, and with compasse stere. But where strict rigor might inforce a doubt, T'incline to fauour, and to helpe me out. On th'other side doth learned Tortus stand Concomitant, and beares the world in hand That Æsope and some Stigmaticks beside, (In shape and wit) did call well-fauour'd Pride A vice, because themselues were so deform'd, At euery pleasure they with malice storm'd; But wiser much, he doth with better face, With equall wit, worth, knowledge (but lesse grace) Confront such fond assertions, lookes awry On all the world of vertue, giues the lye To iudgement, and with crooked minde and backe (Thirsites-like) vnloades this learned packe. He teacheth first that Æsope was a slaue, “But Man's free borne, and freedome ought to haue, “To worke his owne good pleasure, fayre content; “Who liues not thus, hath his whole life mis-spent. This rule he followes, and laies violent hands On all; that his pride, lust, and will, with-stands. Calls his affection reason; his desire And appetite, sets all his world on fire. His childe, his wife, his neighbour, or his friend, Is for his pleasure lou'd; without that end No King, no great Lord, can forget so soone, And slight desert; as he hath often done. Bastards are true legitimates, he saith: And enemies then friends, haue far more faith. His neighbors are most strangers, and before A modest wife, he likes a shamelesse whore. For many whores (he saith) he often kept Without disturbance; but one night, hauing slept In twenty yeares with his true wife, th'assault Of many Sumners did correct the fault. What we terme cowardice, he doth valure call, And in that valure he exceedeth all. An oyster-wife once beat him; brauely hee Bore all her blowes, but wanted heart to flee. He will on Sundaies with an Abbot dine, On Frydaies, with a brother Libertine. And euery day drinke health's vp to the eye: He treads not right vnlesse he treads awry. The Maa of sinne himselfe, is not more free In doing all forbidden sinnes then hee. For what he speakes or teacheth, writes or reads, Only speaks pleasure, and to pleasure leads. Had Nero's froward Tutor (too precise) Been like our Philosarchus, pleasure wise, And pliant to all humors but the good, He had with surfets dyd'e, not lacke of blood. Learn'd Aretine he reads, and can expound His modest pictures with a touch profound. That part is his of euery tongue, and arte, Which stricter Idiots tremble at, and starte To heare recited. This, this man is hee Who on the forefront you with Æsope see. Æsope that lookes awry on all mens vice; But this on vertue casteth scornefull eyes. Æsope makes birds, beasts, fishes, speake and liue As if their liues should Man example giue To practise vertue. This (with apt beheasts) Doth teach all men how to become like beasts. And saith, whose life these creatures most resemble Comes neerest truth, and so doth least dissemble. That Nature is the best guide, if we please To follow her, then we must follow these. For these obserue her rules, and are not spoyl'd By arte, nor haue their able organs foyl'd With abstinence and lacke of vse, but still Directed are by appetite and will. In Kings he would no other vertue see Then what in Lyons, and in Eagles bee: To prey on all, to make their will a law, To tyrannize, to rule by force and awe, To feare no higher powers, to do no good, But liue to glut themselues with guiltlesse blood. Courtiers he would haue fashion'd like to apes, So fond their gestures, so deformde their shapes: So full of idle imitation found, That scorne in them, our stages might confound. That they should starch &amp; paint white, red, blew, yellow And then all blacke, that other fooles might follow. Diuines of Owles he would haue learne to shrieke, As if they hated all the world did like; But hauing got a tree and Iuy bush, He then would haue them mute, and dumbe, and hush, To serue all purposes, to hate the light, And prooue right Blackbirds, children of the night. Men that want wit, yet haue great place in State, He would haue like to Parrots, learne to prate Of others, till with Almonds they were fed. The rest like Foxes he would still haue bred Close, craftie, indirect, to get by stealth The goods both of the Church and Common-wealth. All subiects and inferiors he would haue Themselues like Geese, and Asses to behaue. Rich men and Usurers to swallow all Directed by the Dolphine, and the Whale. All men like Dogs to flatter, and to bite, And misinterpret what we speake or write. He wills all those that on my payers looke, To make each line a libell in my booke: To poyson with their eyes whats'ere they see, And make themselues sport, and make worke for me. Not to beleeue the morall, but to seeke Another meaning whatsoe're they like, And call it mine; and sweare I meant the same, Although I would not persons plainly name. And then he wils them laugh to seeke the ieast. “Anothers mischiefe, makes a merry feast. This Doctor is our Ages guide and Tutor, The world his Schoole, the flesh his Coadiutor. No wonder then if we liue all awry, When on our Master we cast steady eye. For Alexanders necke can teach vs this, “The Schoole and Court by greatnes fashion'd is. Thus our great Masters crookednesse is spide In vs his followers, who no good parts hide That he hath learn'd vs, but proclaime aloud The cause which makes our vertuous Tutor proud. If any seeke his name, and list to come To schoole, enquire for Murus &amp; Antrum. A SVPPLY OF THE description of Monsier Pandorsvs Waldolynnatvs, that merry American Philosopher, or the Wiseman of the New World; being Antipode to Æsop, placed with him as parallel in the front. Done according to the simple truth of his owne naked deliuery. And dedicated to Thomas Thvrsby Esquire, no lesse fit to be publicke, then desirous of retirement and priuacie. Yov shun all office, though your state and wit With long experience makes you truly fit; Wherefore Pandorsus wils me pricke you heere Shriefe in my booke, who might be in the Sheere. As the East and West are opposite, so stand These Wise-men in the front on either hand. Æsope well known an Easterne witty thing: But our Pandorsus Westerne fame I sing; Whose picture in the Front, whose markes before, Behinde, within, without, I late did score; Yet lest that picture, nor these markes, should make His worth enough apparant, briefely take His life anatomiz'de, but chiefly where It may our sucklings with example rere. The lines are drawne euen by his owne true light, From partiall flattery free, and enuious spight. Within that Sqiere where Hyndes with dumplings fed, Beget best Lawyers, was Pandorsus bread: But for his Parents were of better ranke, And in a Coaste Towne dwelt, they Clarret dranke, And wrie-mouth'd Plaice, brets, butts, and soles did eate, And crooked Crabs, with such prodigious meate. Thus for a wonder they prepar'd in feeding: And such he prou'd, who from that roote had breeding. Though no Pandora yet Pandorsus he, For vice as famous, as for vertue shee. Each God gaue her a grace, and gaue so much As more then Momus thought there was no such. But what to her they gaue, from him they tooke, And now in vaine for grace in earth we looke. Looke for effects according to the cause: “Our childrens faults are moulded in our mawes. This salt-fresh-water-daintie diet fed The parts concupiscible, and there bred An itching humor, whence extracted was This quintessence of contraries, this masse Of Natures shreds and parcels, who partakes A part of all, which imperfection makes. A Foxes braines, knowing much wrong, no right; Gote-bearded, sweete-fac'd, like a Catamite; Toung'de Lawyer-like, all terme without vacation; A Baboones loynes, desiring occupation; Crumpe-Cammell-shoulder'd, neckt as straight as lynx, One eye like to a Molls, t'other like Lynx; A Lyons stomack; not to fight but feede; A Hare in heart, and yet a Snaile inspeede. This is the man whom we Pandorsus call. Whose armes or Rebus thus we blasen shall. Vpon a stately wall Saint George doth ride (Wanting a horse) in pompe and armed pride; Beneath there is a Den, in that the Dragon. This tells his name, whose worthy parts we brag on. It is his owne deuice, let all men know: So is the rest which we in order show. His Mothers Husband (who reputed was His Father) being rich and well to passe, A wealthy Merchant and an Alderman, On forraigne shores did trauell now and than: The whilst a Gallant Souldier, new come forth From warre begot this man of mickle worth. This gallant Souldier, then from Belgia brought A wondrous Mandrake (with much perill bought) Sprung (though some thinke it fabulous) from seed The gallowes drop (for so this roote doth breed,) Which whilst his mother did in pleasure eye, Our Mounsiers shape, she did conceiue thereby. Much like that Mandrake, writhen, turning round, As from the gallowes he had dropt to ground. And let no doubtfull Reader much admire, A Myrmidon should be Pandorsus Syre, For as there's none with vs get brauer men Then Lawyers, or the tender Citizen, So none more cowards get, then those which are Our brauest Spirits, most renownde in warre. The cause I know not, or I list not tell, But so it often falles, and heere so fell. None bolder then Pandorsus Syre, then he None fearefuller; and yet he needs would be A Souldier, where the Muster-booke he fild, But fought with none, nor ne're saw any kild. Artemon was more hardy though afraid Of his owne shadow. Wagers haue beene laid, That let an enemie fart, he would out-run An Irishman, for feare t'had been a gun. Where learned Spencer maketh harna'st Feare Afraid the clashing of his armes to heare, That apprehension he from hence did gaine, Our Monsieur did, what Spencer did but faine. But stay, I haue forgot to let you know His education, and to shew you how (Being nusled vp in Letters) he in sport His time wore out at Schoole and Innes of Court, Yet so as once a Gipsie, who did looke Vpon his Palme, said he, should liue by's booke; Which fortune some conceiue hath doubtfull scope, As if his booke should saue him from the rope: But since he proues, it meant another thing, That teaching Tongues, he should liue like a King; And so he now doth, liuing as he lust, And by his owne will measuring what is iust. For being set to Schoole when he was young, He of all knowledge learn'd both taile and tongue. Th' Italian, Latin, Spanish and the French, He grew as cunning in, as at a Wench. A Dictionary of all words of Art, And Lullies old-ends, he hath got by heart. Th'apparrell of all knowledge he doth weare, And 'bout him (Bias-like) his wealth doth beare. And now (growne ripe) he doth religion choose That's most in fashion, as our great ones vse: But otherwise for truth hee'le neuer burne, Th'aduantage of his wry-necke helps him turne: He knowes the way, and wills the world ne're doubt, That comming raw in, hee'le go rosted out. In youth he tooke to Wife a louely Dame, Not hight the chast Penelope by name; But worthy such an attribute, for shee Her wandring loose Vlisses did not see In twenty yeeres, and yet t'is thought her bed Shee kept vnstain'd, and vn-ad-horn'd his head. But what a blessing was, he thought a curse, His wife had better beene, had shee been worse, Her goodnesse made him hate her; she had dide But that a dozen must be kil'd beside. He knew not then (as I haue heard him say) Th'Italian tricke, but the plaine English way, Of simple Country poysoning, now he knowes To do't by inches; Court perfection growes. Lopus and Squire, are not so skill'd as hee, And scarce Romes Conclaue in that mysterie. He can a Nullitie worke, diuorce the life Twixt soule and body, sooner then some wife. And if his ricke be knowne, men ne're will seeke A doubtfull way by law, but do the like. His wife thus scap'd a scouring, so did he, When being merry once in company And passing Smith-field (then vnpau'd) too late With rich Canary hauing linde his pate, The owle-eyde Sharkers spi'd him, how he felt To finde a post; his meaning soone they smelt: And then the sturdiest knaue, with sodain'd rush, Our wauering Monsieur on his knees did push, The whil'st another kindly to him spoke; Help't him out of the durt, and chang'd his cloke. This cloke he wore next day, and passing by A Brokers shop, the prentice lowde gan cry Sirs stop the theefe, the cloake this fellow weares Is mine: with that they swarm'd about his eares, Conuayde him to a Iustice, where one swore He had been branded stigmaticke before. Another said, he was the man that hung Three dayes beyond Seas, as the ballad sung; The cause why he his necke awry, did hold, Was for he hang'd long, and was ta'ne downe cold But to the Iustice being throughly knowne, For carrying letters where't must not be showne, And for his skill, each moderne language speaking, And wondrous Art, to silence doores from squeaking, With losse of his good cloke, he slipt the hooke, And thus he once was saued by his booke. Thus farre I stretch my lines, thus farre he liues, And more I'le write, when he direction giues. But if I die, these lines shall be the glasse His worth to shew, and how I thankfull was. To the ouer-wise, ouer-wilfull, ouer-curious, or ouer-captious Readers. I faine would tell some Tales, but I'de be loth, To haue men be so wise to thinke them troth. This is a wondrous witty age that sees Beyond the truth of things, forty degrees, Each Riddle now hath Poyson in't; each Rime On the blancke Almanak, points at guilty time. Æsope must mak no Lyons roare, nor Eagles Shrike loude, nor wolues rauin, nor swift Beagles Yelpe with their slauering lips after the Foxe, Nor must he meddle with the Asse, or Oxe, For feare some querke be found, to proue he ment Under those shapes, a priuate spleene to vent Against wise vigilant Statists, who like Ianus, Looke both waies squint, and both waies guard and saue vs. Or that he closely would great Lawyers yerke, Who build their neasts, with ruines of the kirke: Or that he toucht some Church-man, who to rise One Steeples height, would tell Canonicall lies. The Ghost of Virgils Gnat would now sting so, That great men durst not in the City go For feare of petty-Chapmen, with a Serieant, And a sly Yeoman, noted in the Margeant. If Spencer now were liuing, to report His Mother Hubberts tale, there would be sport: To see him in a blanket tost, and mounted Vp to the starres, and yet no starre accounted. I dare not for my life in all my tale, Vse any English Bird, Beast, worme, or Snaile, Or fish that in the narrow Seaes do trauell, (Although each Pyrat dares) lest some should cauell, And finde it did belong in times of yore To some blew sleeeue, (but shall do so no more) Or that the Maker of new blood, the Marrold, (Cleped in our welch-Scotch and English Harrold) Had (too too cheape) for fiue pounds it entailed On some bold Britaine, and by warrant nailed, To him and to his house, and double voucher, Fine, and recouery; and then who dare touch her? Not I, I loue my ease too well, my money, My eares, my liberty; he longs for hony, That mongst the angry Whaspes thrusts his bold fingers, And from their neasts in Summer, hunts those stingers. My valour is lesse hardy, my desire Lesse hot Ile blesse and blow, not kisse the fire. Therefore auant all catholike Locusts, come Into my tale nothing one this side Rome, Nor in Virginia, though't be ours by lot, And yet perhaps it may, perchaunc't maynot. I would not, if it lay in me to chuse, Meddle with any thing we Christians vse: But would all dealing with our owne eschew, If other world, and elements I knew. But since that Nature doth some gifts disperse Alike to all within the Vniuerse; And in a cicular globe, tye those to these; Mixt vs in common with th' Antipodes: I cannot choose but do as nature doth, Mixe many names and things well knowne to both. Thus if by chance I vse Bird, Fish, or beast, Which is no daintie at a Mayors feast: But oft familiar food for euery Swaine, That in our Countrey, Coast, and Wood remaine. Yet still conceiue (I pray) those names I take Not properly, but for your ignorance sake. Or if they proper be, of all one kinde, Yet difference in their place of birth we finde. And in their natures. For though man be man, Yet sure an Jndian is no English man, And so an Indian Asse, or Daw, or Trout, Though we haue such, are none of ours no doubt: But would we wonder here, and purses picke, Since none but trauellers euer say the like. Excuse me then though with such names you meete: They are not those that trauell in our streete, But forreiners to vs and to our Nation, Except by trade, commerce, or transplantation Made our acquaintance. Hence thou subtile spies Streach out my tailes to iustifie your lies. If ought beside the morall you inuent, Call it your owne, By me 'twas neuer ment. My tale shall sort all Atheists well, and be Of their religion, heathenish and free. It shall make lust a Gospell and a Law, (Not for the truth) but to keepe fooles in awe, That when our Gospell or else Law doth thwart Our willes, we then may neither reck a f?. Come Ibis, Lead the way; eat one snake more And by my fury; vsher on before 1. IBIS. Dedicated To the religious Knight S? Edmvnd Mondeford, and his Lady a true louer of LEARNING. Knowledge and Grace, are antidotes to you, Who killing Serpents, do not Serpents grow. Egypt opprest with Serpents, either growing From slimie NILVS fruitfull ouerflowing, Or from the enuious bankes of Tyber sent To tell what farther harme the Romans ment: Or by the foggy Southern winds brought o're From sandy Lybia to this fertile shore: Made Ibis Keeper of their liues and states, VVho like a watchfull Porter, kept the gates VVhere this infected Crue did vse to enter: And (as they came in poysoned troopes) did venter Manger their sting, and teeth, and venome too, To swallow th' enuious Aspes with small adoe. So long shefed, that Egypt now seem'd free, And scarce a Serpent in the land could see. “But ouer-feeding hurts, as some men say, “Though food be good: then surfet soone we may “By poysoned bits. And Ibis found it true. So that her glutted gorge shee's forc't to spue; The noysome stinke where of infected more Then by these Serpents had bin stung before, And Ibis selfe (corrupted with the food) Grew Serpentine, and did more harme then good, Shee keeps no entrance now, but lets them passe, And of their faction, and their treason, was A cunning aider, and a close contriuer; Al-gate Shee seem'd a diligent, faithfull, diuer Into their darker holes to search them out: But truth it was to put them out of doubt, That Shee their friend, they need not feare a foe, But might at pleasure through the kingdome goe, VVhilst all neglected their increase, supposing, Ibis their trusty warden, had been closing The lands strong Ports, with skill to keepe these in, And others out, till all had eaten bin. But she had other aimes, and vnder hand, Plac'd Cockatrices all about the land: And such as these (who kin to serpents were) Did she make Captains, and to place preferre Of chiefe command in warre: with hope to bring, The Basiliske to be th'Egyptian king; The Basiliske that at the head of Nile, VVith deadly poyson doth the spring defile. Thus Ibis faild them, and betraide their trust, And now or die themselues, or kill they must. And scarce was't in their choice. Such quick increase “Hath bad things more then good, in time of peace. Yet the Egyptians from securer sleepe, Of foolish pitty, and remisnesse deepe, Or fond credulity, and easie faith, At last awak't, whats'euer Ibis faith, Suspects of fraud, of double-meaning, doubt, And with quicke search do finde the treason out. Which Ibis seeing to be past preuention, Past skill to cloke and couer with inuention: With malice, enuie, feare, and horror swelling, And other poyson in her bosome dwelling, Shee burst asunder, and preuents the paine Her crime deseru'd, but not the shame and staine: That the Egyptians left for after times, To reade and wonder at in these few times. “Whom nature made good, custome made vniust; We trusted Ibis, but shee faild our trust. Let Reason rule, and Reason thus exhorts, “Make not your will wardon of your Cinque Ports. 2. Uenaticum Jter. Dedicated To the example of Temperance, S? Henry Bedingfeild Knight, and to his Lady the example of Loue. You hunting loue, your fields are spread with sheepe, Looke that your hounds, your folds from foxes keepe. Foxes and Wolues in sheepskins range about: Within opinions; Parasites without. Th' Egyptian Shepheard arm'd at all assayes With Dogs and Sheephookes, sat vpon the Layes, At pleasure piping many a learned sonnet Of fixed starres, and each course-keeping plannet: Of thunder, lightning, meteors, and the cause Of changing kingdomes, and translating lawes: Why pestilence did rage, why good men die, Why Nilus ouerflowes the bankes so hie, Why killing frosts, and such aboundant snow, That ruine falling, ruine as they thaw: Why th'earth should barren be, and famine breede In the fat soile, though sowne with better seede. Why water, ayre, the earth, and cheerefull fire Should (being made for man) gainst man conspire, And of themselues (by nature neuer bidden,) Bring forth such crosse effects, vnheard and hidden, To plague poore man, and liuing him t'intombe In his one ruines, e're the day of doome. The cause of this, they wisely found to be Mans open sins, and close Hypocrisie. And of this Theame discoursing too and fro, Prouing it was, wishing it were not so. The King came by, and with him many Nobles, Whose pestred traine the sheep and shephead troubles. Poore Country, thou find'st this in corne and cattle, When most remote fr? Court, thou most dost battle The King a hunting rides; the shepheards dogs Would needs a hunting too, and onward iogs These iolly Currs: the Shepheards whoope amaine, Hollow and whistle too, but all in vaine. The Hunts-men rate, and like to mad men ride; The Currs suppose they cheere them when they chide: So on they go, and doe as others doo, Throw vp their curld tailes, spend their wesands too, And when thy cannot top the rest, run after So long, till anger now is turn'd to lafter; And now the King delights the Currs to heare. For they are euer busie in his eare; And comming home to trencher-food they fall, Prouing good blood-hounds some, good harriers all. They can draw dry-foot to the harmlesse game, Whil'st Wolues and Foxes passe their noses tame. Thus fed by fat sweet bones, they all proue gluttons, And where they wont to guard, now kill our muttons, They learned haue Court lore, and nothing failes; Can fawne and flatter, nimbly wag their tailes; And snarle, and bite, and beat the better hound Out of the Court, who their false hunting found. And now the time drawes on, the King againe Rides out to hunt, and with him all his traine. These dogs are fore-most, and pursue the chace With eager stomackes and with equall pace. But being trencher-fed, the weather hot, Themselu's vnbreath'd, to hunting vsed not, They soone are shaken off, and waxing slacke Become the lag and hindmost of the packe; And straight lose sight, sent, hearing of the rest. So then to Nilus-ward they hold it best To turne their course, with the coole waues to slacke The heat they got, for double diligence sake. The roughest, rudest, curstest Curr of all, Which wont vpon the gentlest Dogs to fall, (And neither being Hound nor Mastiffe bred, But of a mongrill kinde, by shee-Wolues fed, Did silence such as spent their sweeter voice In turnefull tones, which Hunters eares reioyce, Whil'st he nor at the fold would watch in darke, Nor bite the Wolfe, nor with his harsh voyce barke, Nor here amongst the Hounds once open wide His monstrous chaps, except, to bite, or chide, Or rauin and deuour the daintyest meat Which the industrious, not the slug should eat: And in despite of whips, though crouch and cry, Would neuer mend, nor better grow thereby) Led on the way, for he would still be fiist, His impudence was such, and such his thirst. Nor would he suffer auy their to drinke Till he had done. Ambitions eye doth thinke To swallow all, and all too little to, For him that least deserues, and least can doo. But see a iust reward, whil'st thus he lies Tending his pleasure, from the waues doth rise A cruell subtle Crocodile, who snatcheth At him with her sharpe fangs, quickly catcheth The lazie Curre; which struggles, cryes, and striues. But all too late. Th' amphibious monster diues Vnder the waues; the Dog resists in vaine, Death swallowes him, the rest runhome amaine; Home to the Sheepfolds, and attend the trade They were by Art traind to, by Nature made. And fearing now the like, for-warn'd by this, When hot and dry they waxe, their custome is, At banks of Nile nere to rest and stay, But here and there to lap, and so away; Lest otherwise some Crocodile being hid, Should serue their sloth, like as the other did. Epimythium. This tale doth teach, each man himselfe t'apply To his Vocation; not to looke awry At Honors, Riches, Pleasures, which art baites The deuill layes in our way, and in them waites To swallow vs, whilest eagerly we seeke To swallow and ingrosse whats'ere we like: Without respect what's honest iust, and fit, So we by any meanes can compasse it. Each hath his element, his toyle, and sport. The clowne the country, and the King his Court. The Nobles in the Councell or the field, The Sea, and Burse, doth like to Marchants yeeld. Each trades-man in his shop, house-wiues at home; “They range too far, that o're the threshold rome. Lawyers vpon the bench, Diuines within their studies, schooles or pulpits; else they sinne. Who takes the plow in hand, must neuer slacke, “Nor looke about, for then ne looketh backe, Who takes the Crowne and Scepter, still must think “When others soundly sleep, he must but winke, Who goes to warre, or counsell must aduise “The shame or honor on the Noblest lies. Who guides the Helme must still his compas minde, “And cheere his mates, and saile with euery winde. Who by Mechanicke Arts doth hope to thriue, “Must be a Bee, and make his shop his Hiue. Who sits to Iudge, the Person must neglect, “Not looke asquint, but to the truth direct. Who will Episcopize, must watch, fast, pray, “And see to worke, not ouersee to play. They haue a double charge, to rule, and teach, “Whil'st they neglect to preach, neglect they preach, Each must his Doicesse tend; or if at Court, What others dare not he must still report. Yet nought but truth, nor all truthes but the good: (So Moses in the gap of vengance stood) What others dare not whisper he must sing, And like a golden trumpet rouze the King, VVith wise alarums from securer sleepe, VVherein fraile flattring flesh doth greatnesse keepe For greatnesse, both in state, wit, strength, and all That wee call great one earth, is apt to fall VVith greatest danger, greatest violence, Vnlesse vpheld by greatest diligence. And he is only worthy to be great, VVho with a vertuous freedom holds the seat Of Moses, and inclines to neither hand, But both vpright only for truth doth stand, Such tend their flocks; whil'st they attend the Court, Their pastime 'tis to moderate each sport. They season all raw humors. Seldome glance On honours or on pleasurs, but by chance: And then to recreate their spirits they do it, Taking a snatch, and fall the harder to it. GRYPS. Dedicated To the Courtly and accomplisht Knight, S?. Henry Rich, and his most equall Lady. All Men seeke greatnes: goodnesse is the way. Hee's oft lesse King that rules, then doth obay. Adde to Gods worke your owne, his image then Shall be repayr'd, for that's the crowne of Men. The Griffon (well alli'd, and great in power) Made challenge to be generall Emperour Of beasts, and birds; whose title to decide, A generall Councell was proclaimed wide Through all the world, and euery bird and beast Together met, the greatest, and the least. Mongst these some crawling serpents, some with feet, And some with wings did at this Councell meet, And claim'd the place of beasts, and did alledge Full many ancient lawes of priuiledge For their high honour; but the chiefe was this; They prou'd themselues beasts, out of Genesis. But when that Law was read, and it was found, Their treason brought a curse vpon the ground; That euer since their poyson did annoy Both birds and beasts, and oft did both destroy; Cloking their fraud, guilding their villanie With ancient vniuersall-vnity; Betraying truth with darke ambiguous lies, And cosening man of blessed Paradise: Adulterating, purging of the sence Of holy Writ, vnder a good pretence: They had by generall voice, strict banishment From comming nere this Court of Parliament. And now the rest proceed; but by the way Arose another cause of some delay, Comming to choose a Speaker, bolde Iack daw Would interpose his skill, and vouch a Law, (The law of Parasites) that each one might Speake what him list, gainst reason or gainst right. And that no Speaker needed, ought to be, Where such a mixture was; for if quoth he, We choose a bird, the beasts will all dissent; If they a beast, we shall be discontent. This speech, though true in part, did all offend, Because they saw his busie tongue did bend To crosse all businesse, and his wit deuise To change the firmest knots to nullities. So they agreed together in this sort, To cut his nimble tongue a little short, For sawcie tatling, where he should not teach; And being silent where he ought to preach. But he auoides his sentence with a quirke, Pleading of old he longed to the Kirke, Though seldom he came there; and each one tooke Him for no Clarke, vntill he claim'd his booke Then they perceiu'd his skill; and soone discerned How he to flatter and backbite was learned; Could mount a steeples top, and with the winde Turne like a weather-cocke his ready minde, Seruing the time. Therefore they onward passe To choose a Speaker; some would haue the Asse, Because he could diminish nought nor adde, But truth deliuer, were it good or bad: Yet most mislik'd that choice, and those pronounce The Parrot fit, and some the nimble Ounce; Some the sweet Nightingale, and some the Dog, And some the Fox, the Baboone, some the Hog; Some Robin red-brest, or the speckled Thrush, Some Chantecleere, and some the VVoodcock flush. Some chose the Ape, and some mislike his voice, So sundry factions rise from his heard choice. At last the Elephant perswades with all, To take an equall course, and Man to call As Speaker, Iudge, and Vmpire in this thing, Being by nature the worlds generall King, And the most fit t'appoint and to depute His owne Emperiall bird-beast substitute. To this they all consent, and to this end In humble wise to Man this Message send, That he their Patron, Gouernor and Lord, VVould daigne this mighty difference to accord VVith reason and authority. His consent Is soone obtain'd: now gins the Parliament. In which the Griffon thus begins his plea. Grand Emperour, of Ayre, Earth, and Sea; I challenge by prerogatiue, and birth, To be your Vicar generall on the Earth, O're birds and beasts: The beasts I ought command, Because vpon foure feet like them I stand. The birds I ought to rule, cause I can flie With these my wings like them, and soare as hie. I doe surpasse the beasts in hauing wings, The birds in legs, in taile, and other things: My force doth match the Lyons, and my heart The Eagle, or excels them in each part. Your doome I therefore claime, that I may be Plac'd equall to my worth in soueraigntie: And next your selfe the Emperour be of Earth, According to the priuiledge of my birth. Then spake the Elephant, and said, that he Ought ouer beasts the only Lord to be. His strength was great, and more then others farre, His honours purchasde more in manly warre: His learning more, the letters vnderstanding, And aptly doing all, wise Man commanding. Gainst him vp rose the Syre of Bankes his horse, And challeng'd him to try, wit, worth, and force. This grew to heate, but then the mighty Rucke Soone parts the fray, each did from other plucke; Desires she might be heard, her challenge was To rule all birds, since she all birds did passe. The Wren straight hopt about, and said, his name Did shew from what a royall stocke he came. And euery bird and beast, the great and small, Had his ambitious ayme to gouerne all, Which hauing made, in silence all sate downe Being ouer-aw'd with mans Emperiall frowne. Each fear'd, each hop'd, vntill at length the Man Rose vp, and to determine thus began. I was your Master made, you made for me, And whatsoeuer in the Globe there be Hid or reueal'd, t'is mine. And I alone Sole Emperour am, vnder that onely One. Nor doubt you this; the question now in hand Is for the vnder-king-ship of my land; For t'is not fit that I should troubled be With euery toy, when subiects disagree: But that my President should still be nigh, Your doubts and iarres t'appease and rectifie. It only rests to shew what parts are fit For gouernment. That's courage, strength and wit, Mercy and iustice, and the guard to those, Awe to command, dexteritie to dispose. If any part of these be separate, The rule is most imperfect, and the State Falls to contempt; the lawes are trodden downe, The Scepter broken, and despis'd the Crowne. This shewes how many here haue vainly sought For one good part, the wreath that many ought. That nor the Ruck, the Elephant nor Horse, Are fit to gouerne for their matchlesse force; Nor for their wit alone; for then the Oxe Might make his claime too, and subtle Foxe: Much lesse the silly Wren for honor'd house, Nor the catt-fearing, Elephant-frighting Mouse. For these would breed contempt, and Athens Owle Might challenge so night-rule of eu'ry Fowle. Nor is it meet this Griffon should obtaine What by pretence of right he seeks to gaine. Because his title halts on either side, Except in halues, himselfe he will deuide. He is no beast: his talents, wings, and head Conclude against his challenge in my stead. Nor yet a bird: his body, legs, and tayle With euidence his garments all do quaile. But if where proofe lyes hid, we may proceede By probabilities; from spurious seede He tooke his being, and would neither loue, Being like to neither, but a Tyrant proue. And where he boasts his wondrous strength and hart, It's false he doth pretend, because that part Which shewes him Lyon-like in shape, hide, haire, Doth of the kingly-Lyon stand in feare. And that birds part which he from th'Eagle tooke, On the sky-towring Eagle dares not looke. The Lyon therefore I ordaine and make The King of beasts; his awfull voice shall shake The proudest spirit. And the Eagle shall Be King of Birds, and ouer-looke them all. This sentence past, the Parlament arose, And with these rules of truth the Sessions close. Epimythium. Who seeks two swords to sway, hath right to none; Who seeks two offices, is not fit for one: Who seeks two callings, takes too much in hand: Who hath two faiths, doth true to neither stand. One sword, one office, calling, and one faith, Is fit for one Man; so this storie saith. 4. SPHINX, HYENA. Dedicated To the wise and valiant Souldier, S?. Iohn Pooly Knight, and to his good Lady. You lou'd my Brother, he is gone, I stay, T'acknowledge first a debt, and then to pay: Loue lookes vpon the will, which easily can Proue ther's no bankrupt but the thanklesse Man. Hyena was a subtle beast and bloudy; To ruine man was his whole trade and study. He scorn'd the sheep, the shepheard was his prey, His nightly plots got, what he mist by day. The shepheards of Arcadia, beguil'd By his fain'd voice, were murther'd oft and spoil'd. For in the night he wont like some good friend, To call them out, and then a peeces rend. One onely wiser shepheard thought it best Hire Sphinx to watch his house whil'st he did rest: Whose subtiltie foresaw, and still preuented, What else his Master had too late repented. For when the false Hyena went about Calling for helpe, to traine the Shepheard out, Faining distresse as if he robbed were, Or mist his way (a weary traueller); Sphinx soone perceiu'd his counterfeit complayning, And laught out-right to heare his craftie fayning; But would not let the credulous shepheard goe, (Whose tender heart pittied his mortall foe) Till day appear'd, and that the Sunne shone bright. Together with the Sphinx full many a night, An Indian Asse and Musk-cat, safely slept, Whil'st Sphinx the shepheards house &amp; houshold kept. Nor did they alwaies sleep but often heard What at the first to thinke vpon they fear'd; But custome at the length bereft all awe, And they afrayd were when they nothing faw. So enuy wrought, and Ignorance, and Pride, That they the wiser Sphinx dare now deride. And mou'd the Shepheard, to preuent the charge Of keeping more, to let the Sphinx at large. Perswading there was no such cause of dread, But they might well supply the Sphinx his stead: Who fain'd those feares, and did imagine treason, To win th'opinion of much wit and reason. The Sheapheard fondly credits this; and straight Lets loose the Sphinx, and these in order waite. The Indian Asse he trusted being plaine, Supposing he would neither lye, nor faine. And the Musk-cat, was pleasant to the smell, And very watchfull; needs must these do well. The night is come, the Shepheard soundly sleeps As he had wont, no skar his conscience keeps. These two stand Sentinel, and now ere long, Comes the Hyena, and with smoothing tongue Saith; Is your Master waking, gentle swaines? If not, arere him, tell him all the Plaines Are vp in armes against our common foe, The false Hyena that beguil'd vs so. He cannot scape their hands, for they haue found The Caue he keeps in, closely vnder ground. Bid him awake and rise and come away, For all the Shepheards for his comming stay. This tale beleeu'd, the Asse and Musk-cat hye, To make their Master to make hast to dye. He riseth rashly, opes the doore, goes out, And is deuour'd ere he can looke about. Nor can the watch-men scape, but both are slaine: Though one be sweet, the other true and plaine. Epimythium. “Not simple truth alone can make vs fit, “To beare great place in State without great wit. “For when the Serpent comes to circumuent vs, “We must be Serpents too, or els repent vs. HIPPOPOTAMUS. Dedicated To the magnificent Knight S?. Hvgh Smith, and his worthy Lady. Your Auon's quiet, no such Monsters feede 'Bout sandy Seuerne, as in Nilus breede: Nilus-like your bountie ouerflowes, Whence good report, and fame, and honour growes. The Sea-horse; and the famous Crocodile, Both challeng'd to be Kings of fruitfull Nile; And sundry fields they fought, where many dyed Of either faction, still the cause vntried. Yet often had they single, hand to hand, Encountred in the flood, and on the land: And parted still with equall harme away, Nor both the blowes bore thence, but not the day; Yet each inuincible himselfe did call, And so they were, but to themselues, to all. But when they cop'd, successe did thus conclude; Courage remayn'd, strength only was subdu'd. And so for want of strength they often sundred, Though at their wondrous strength al other wondred Thus oft they met, and oft assay'd in vaine, Who should th'Emperiall crowne of Nilus gaine: Till both grew weary of these warres at length, And gan lay by the vse of armes and strength. And truce proclaim'd a while on either part, A fained truce, no friendship from the heart. For vnder-hand by stratagems, and friends, And secret plots, each sought their seuerall ends. But much more noble was the Crocodile, And wiser much, though not so full of guile As Hippopotamus, so th'other hight, Who car'd not what he did, or wrong or right, By falshood, bribes, or treason; so he could, The foulest fact, to his aduantage mould, And thus he call'd Chameleon on a day, With Polypus, and vnto them gan say: You two my bosome-friends, my Minions are, My priuie Counsellers in peace and warre. And I haue found you plyant to my will, Faithfull to me, but false to others still. And now I craue, your vtmost Art and reason, In conquering of the Crocodile by treason; Which thus I purpose: Both of you are made, By nature apt to colour and to shade, With fit resemblance all the obiects nye, On which you shall reflect a steady eye, You can seeme otherwise, then what you be, And couer hate with close hypocrisie, You can take any shape, any disguise, And soone beguile the most inquisitiue eyes; Weare any Liuery, all companies fit, And to each humour change your ready wit. This you haue done before, and oft made plaine Weightie intelligence, and can so againe. But each his proper element retayning, Chameleon in the ayre, and earth remaining, You Polypus at sea. To sea then hye, And with rich promises Torpedo buy To our close seruice: he in Counsell is To our great foe, a greater friend of his. “But wealth is our best friend, and that corrupts “The purest minde, and friendship interrupts. With gifts and promises peruert him so, That he may call vs friend, count him a foe: Will him he would, when fitting time doth come, With his slowe touch, secure, bewitch, benumme, Our aduersary, and his sense astonish, That it may seeme a crime him to admonish Of our apparant practises preparing, Whilst he attends his sports, no danger fearing. Then to the Water-rat Ichneumon goe, And you to Cuschillus and will them too, When next they picke his teeth, and scratch his head, For they are neere him still at euery stead, And highly fauor'd, (chiefly Cuschillus), Though both in fee and pension be withvs), That they would ioyne their wits and force together To murther him; and for reward come hither. So when your plots he closely thus conuey'd, And all your traines and tew in order laid, Then mixe your selues in either element With the profuse, the needy, discontent, The desperate, the bloody, and the bold, Whom nought but feare do from rebellion hold; Of such you shall finde many in this State. For hee's remisse, and doth all businesse hate, Whereby he gets contempt, and opens wide A ready way of entrance vnespide To our high aimes. Full many you shall finde Of our close faction, fitting to our minde. Those that are such encourage, others frame, And what you will speake largely in our name; Promise, and sweare, and lye, to make things fit, That our designes may prosper by our wit. Away, and for the rest leaue that to me. The spies instructed thus fit agents be, And post with speede, and with a speed too good Dispatch all Scenes fit for the Act of blood. And now the wise, learn'd, valiant Crocodile, A hunting hies vnto the bankes of Nile: Where hauing sported long, and fully fed, The slow Torpedo strokes him on the head, Whispers within his eare, and charmes him so That in the Sun-shine he to rest must go. But as he goes drowsie and reeling thus, Meets him the Indian Rat, and Cuschillus, And lowting low with musicke him presents, And antique shewes, and masking meriments; Striuing to hide their treason with such Art, That their true care almost betraid their heart, This wise Alcedo (one that many a dish Had for his King prepar'd, of dantiest fish), Did soone suspect, and with shrill voice gan crie, Sir King beware, for enemies are nie; Beware of him that's busie with your eare, And tells you lies, that truth you may not heare: Beware of him that's scratching of your head, Beware of him that's making of your bed. Beware of him that doth extoll you so, And like a God adores you as you go: Beware of him that doth so humbly fall On his false knee; good King beware of all. With that the Crocodile gan looke about, Being halfe asleep, from a sweet dreame wak'd out, And would haue heard more, but the charmers kept The bird away by force; and so he slept. He slept, and Cuschillus did sing the while, And pickt his teeth, and vsed many a wile To ope his ouer-chap (for onely he Doth moue his ouer-chap, the nether we): At last he tickled him, and forc't him so To yawne and gape: then Cuschillus doth go Into his belly, and the Indian Rat Leapes quickly after; where they first search what Close counsels, secret purposes did fill His darker bosome, were they good or ill. But were they good or ill, it matters not, For they pursue and prosecute their plot: They gin to gnaw his bowels, and to rake His entrailes with their nailes; which paine doth wake Him from his latest sleepe, and makes him crie Aloud this counsell: Princes see ye trie. Before ye trust, Those seruants that be ill “At your commaund, for others money will “Betray you too: he easly will dispense “With greatest sinnes, who hath of small no sence. “Beware of such as flatter by traduction, “Theile first be others, then be your destruction. “Beware of priuie whisperers and spies, “The truth they tell is but a sauce for lies. Beware of Ledgers, for legerdemaine With others beside Iuglers doth remaine: “And cheating and crosse-biting Great ones may “In great things vse, as Little ones at play. Beware of Clergie men their colour changing, And in each place with lawlesse freedome ranging. Take heede of Pensions, they haue often slept, In priuy Chambers, and at Counsell kept. And if it be a truth which some haue told, Good men haue had large sleeues to put vp gold. With that he dies, and those that were within, Striuing who first should greatest credit win, By carrying newes of this accursed deede, Hinder each other in their hasty speede: And issuing out iust as his chaps did close, Did their reward, life, fame, together lose. “Yet ill report findes wings in euery place; And this vnto the Sea-horse flies apace; Who (making too much hast) in top of pride, Nothing before, behinde, nor bout him spide, And so, for lacke of care, himselfe betraide Into a pit-fall which th'Egyptians laid. There he doth pine to death, and dying cries, “Who liues by treason, thus by treason dies. PHÆNIX. Dedicated To the honorable Knight S?. Robert Riche, and his noble Lady. There's but one Phænix, is there had been more, Your names had stood within, but now before. Th' Arabian Phænix, being noble, young, And newly from his fathers ashes sprung, Seeing how other birds did louers take Of their owne kind, would needs like tri[illeg.] And thought by what good course he might preuent His doubted ruine, and seeme prouident, Where nature (as he iudg'd) defectiue stood, In leauing single, such an absolute good. His meanes was marriage, married he would be, But where to choose a Mate he could not see: For choose hee might and please his curious eyne, Each bird made suite to be his Valantine. The Pehen drest her selfe and spred her taile, The Turkey-hen aduanc'd her spotted saile. The Turtle left her mate to ioyne with him, The Siluer-Swan, in ruffled pride did Swim, The Parakite, and Goldfinch,, Citie heires, Offer'd him loue, and what besides was theirs: The courtly Pheasant gaudy Popiniay, In varied coloures drest themselues that day: The sweet Canary singer stroue t'excell The merry-making mournefull Philomel; Who left deploring, and did mirth preferre: Wishing the Phænix would haue rauish't her. All these, with all besides the rest excelling, Did woo him, proffer loue, their passions telling. But all in vaine; the bird of Paradise, Had with her pleasing forme bewitcht his eyes. He wooes, and winnes her too, with small adoe, “Where both desire, both parties seeme to wooe: And who would not desire so rare a one, Whom all desire, him to enioy alone? They married are. Opinions equall voice, Say both are happy in each others choice. For she was faire, and rare, and rich, and young, And wise, and noble, and full sweetly sung; In all complete she was, only did faile, Hauing too small a body for her taile. This fault she tooke by kinde, it cost her nought, From her birth place the frailtie first she brought. And though by all good meanes she stroue to hide This naturall blemish, still it was espide. And spied the more, because this corporall ill, Being single here, did each mans fancy fill. “That disproportion doubles in the minde, “Where we it single in the body finde. And so it fell out here; not long they dwelt In peace, but loues fire alteration felt, And gan to slake and coole, where it should not, And where it should be coole, it waxed hot. Shee now did hate and loath, the sweet she had, And linger after something that was bad. Her taile was too too large for him to tread, He too too little her to ouer-spread. To ouerspread her body was not much, But her insatiate taile, and minde was such. So weakest stomacks strongest meates desire. So greatest smoke riseth from smallest fire. So slender wits great matters vndertake. So swift pursuite, doth slow performance make. So th'appetite, by impotence is mou'd. So shee (though little) eu'ry great thing lou'd. She lou'd all great things, and all rare things sought, But what she had that she esteemed nought. She had what others long'd for, and enioyde What all desir'd: and that enioying cloyde. And now she ginnes to hate, and wish in heart, A fit occasion offer'd were to part. But wanting such, shee frames one: doth traduce, And wound his honour for her owne excuse. And still pretending modesty a cause, Immodestly, she triall claimes by lawes. Although the Phænix her with teares did woo, She separation sought, and gets it too. The sentence past, she Cynosure doth wed, And vnknowne fowle, by th'ayre begot and bred. He (following kind) trod oft, and quencht her heate, And she laid oft, fild many a neast and seate With addle egges; but neuer bird did spring, Out of those shells, nor other liuing thing. Yet some in their opinions counted wise, Say that such egges do hatch the Cockatrice. Yet nothing from these spurious Embrions came But naked promises, and openshame. In memory of whose vnhappy wombe, That brought dead fruit forth, like a liuing tombe, (Dead fruit, much like faire apples all of smoake, Which grow in Sodome, and the eaters choake,) Each courtly lady now vpon their head, Do weare a bird of Paradise, instead Of a light feather; which doth warning giue, How free from lightnesse, Ladies ought to liue: How constant they should be, how firme in loue: Not feather-like, apt with each breath to moue. How well proportion'd, not so great below, But lesse in shew, and more in truth to know. To fit the bottome with an equall saile, And not to ouer-top the head with taile. All this it tells them, and doth shew beside, “How addle egges spring out of lust, and pride. “How noble houses by ignoble deeds, “Bury themselues and their owne ruine breeds. “How beautie and all vertues of the minde, “Conioynde with wealth, adorne not woman kinde: “Except with these, true chastitie be plac'd, “And that againe, by modesty be grac'd. And now I will proceede to tell my story, How sad the Phænix was in minde, how sory To be so sleighted and so ill respected, By her for whose sake, he had all neglected. This wounds his heart, and he resolues too late, All second matches for the first to hate; To liue alone, and neuer more to minde Fond alteration, in the course of kinde. But griefe perplex't him so, he fear'd to die, Ere he were fitted for posteritie. And so his neast vnmade, he quickly might, Both life, and name, and memory loose out-right This to preuent, his flight he nimbly takes O're hilles and dales, o're desarts, riuers, lakes, O're kingdomes, countries, bounding East and West, And spices gathers vp to build his neast. Which made, and finding still his former griefe, Not cur'd but growing desperate of reliefe, Him better seem'd by priuiledge of kinde, To kill his body, and renue his minde: To leaue griefe where it breeds with earth on earth, And recreate his spirit with spritly birth, (Like fire, which touching powder straight resolues The grosser parts; and each it selfe inuolues In its owne element) then so t'outweare And tyre away with griefe sixe hundred yeare, (For so long liues the Phænix) but thought he, “So long he dies that liues in miserie. And therefore soone betakes him to his neast, Wherefore-prepar'd he finds his funerall drest. The Sun shines bright and hot, he with his wings Makes more the heate: &amp; sparkling diamond brings, Whose strong reflection, or retention rather Either beates backe the heate, or heate doth gather. Which kindled (like dri'd leaues with burning glasses) Consumes the neast, and bird, and all to ashes. Vpon these ashes fruitfull dewes descend, And the hot Sun his actiue beames do bend. So heate and moisture twixt them procreate, A silly worme vnlike the bird in state. But time doth giue it growth, and shape, and feathers, And still perfection from each houre it gathers. Till to the former equall it appeares, Or rather all one bird, except in yeares. The rauenous Vulture wondring long had stood To marke all this, within a neighbour wood. Which hauing seene, ambition pricks her so, That she resolues what'euer power saith no, Example and direction hence to take, Her selfe and hers all Phænixes to make. So calls she first the Hee, and then the young: And thus gan speake to them with rauisht tounge. How much my power hath done, how much my wit, You know, yet know some repetition fit. I do the Eagle rule, (the birds braue King) And worke him to my minde in euery thing. He preyes on whom I list; still on the best; Eates what I stint him, and leaues you the rest. I gouerne euery Hawke, or bird of prey; Such as confront the Eagle, me obay; And make me sharer in their richest prize, And how to please me best, best meanes deuise. I that despise Religion, scorne all law, Do binde all other birds to both by awe: To both for my aduantage, else you know I can prophane the Temple well enough; Pollute the Altar; search the graue, each tombe, And dig out of the priuiledged wombe Of hallow'd earth, dainties for you to lurch, Mans flesh, enshrined in the sacred Church. You know I foster Souldiers not for loue, But to breed warres; the slaine my prey still proue. All sorts, professions, kinds, I prey vpon, When their sweete flesh in turn'd to carrion. For carrion is my food, let others kill And hazzard life for life, we safely will Eate the vnfortunate, the weake, distressed, Whom want enfeebled, mightie power oppressed. This is our practise. But I cald ye now For higher aimes: to giue you notice how We may aspire in royaltie and pride Aboue the Eagle, and all birds beside. Much time, much study, with full large expence, Haue I bestowed, to gaine intelligence Of a rare secret, which exceedeth farre Th' Alchimisters Idol, call'd th'Elixar. This is, to vnderstand and know aright, What course to take, and how we compasse might The glorious eminence, the singular grace, The famous Phænix hath in euery place: How to attaine her nature, beauty, state; And without copulation procreate. At length my wit, my industry, and chance Concurring, did this happinesse aduance: For watching lately, as I often did, In desart vast, among thicke bushes hid, I saw (vnseene) the mysterie throughout, And can resolue each rite, each scrupulous doubt. The circumstance were needlesse, whil'st the fact Shall manifest each seuerall Scene, and act, With happy issue; and accomplish so Our wishes, that we shall amazed goe; Amazed goe, to see our selues so low, So soone to such a pitch of glory grow: So soone translated, metamorphosed, And new created from the foot to head: Beyond our hopes, report, the present station Of other birds, almost to adoration. Enquire not how, but each prepare t'obay, What I command; performance leads the way. Hie on, hie all, to seuerall quarters flie, And through the whole world make a scrutinie For aromatick drugges, perfuming spices, Rare pretious stones, rich iewels, strange deuices. Bring them together, lay them on this hill, And the successe refer to my deep skill. The young ones all obayde, but then the Male Staid long t'enquire the reason of this tale. Yet long he durst not stay, lest shee from thence Should beate him for his arrogant offence: For females of all rauening fowles beare sway, And the blacke Vulture is a bird of prey. The male ne're meddles with young, meat, or nest: But shee commands, and he sits like a guest. He seeing her incenst, away doth post Ore many Seas, and many an vnknowne Coast, And all the world surueyes from East to West, From North to South, and gathers what is best; Sweet odoriferous spices, amber-greece, The Castors stones, the Ermins spotted fleene, Rich Luzerns, Sables, Martins, and the horee Of the most precious-seld-seen Vnicorne. The Musk-cats cod, with Rubies blushing red, Quick-sparkling Diamonds cutting glasse like lead; Bright shining Carbuncles, and Saphires blew, With Iasper, Iacynth; Emerals greene in view; Perspicuous Christall, orient Pearles large, round, And Gold, for which man doth the Center sound; Blacke, white, greene, marble; in-laid Porphyrie, With Alablasters for Imagerie: Truth-trying Touch-stones, making things distinct, And what rariety else within precinct Of ample Nature dwels, they hither brought; With which a curious neast shee neatly wrought, To match whose wealth remaining earth was base. Her selfe, Mate, yong, each by themselues had place In this most royall building. Then in state Her selfe sate downe, and next her musing Mate. Her young ones, then in order, One by One, And now the Sunne shin'd hot on euery stone The spice gan kindle. Now quoth shee I finde My selfe halfe made immortall changing kinde. The fire flam'd fiercer then, and sing'd their wings: Be constant Sirs quoth shee, you shall be Kings. “Gold crownes are heauy, toyle is hard but gainfull; “There is no excellent sweet but first is painfull. They would haue flowne away, but 'twas too late. Quoth shee the Phænix dies to liue in state. With that she sinkes, her neast and all combust Her glorious hopes, and proiects turn'd to dust. Which tells vs this: Pride still doth ouer-build. “Folly is not in architecture skill'd. “Wit frames his Plot according to his state, “And to a small house makes no lofty gate. “But ouer-bold Ambition fires her neast, “And proues her houses shame, her house a ieast. VNIO. DEDICATED TO THE TRVE LOVER OF HIS COVNTRY S?. Arthvr Heveningham Knight, and his truly Religious Lady. Yov know the moodes of Men, the tempers too Of Climes, of States, of Elements; Then who May better read this tale? The minde that's free Can iudge diseases, and distempers see. The Mole, Chamelion, and the Salamander, As neere the Ocean they together wander, Spying at sea the Lamprey, haild him thus: Good day my friend to you and eke to vs. We three are met to argue and debate Which of vs liueth in the happiest state; Whether the ayre, the earth, or fire doth giue To what they breed best sustenance to liue. And we would gladly heare how farre the sea May with fire, ayre, and earth compared be. You happily we met as we would wish, Being a prompt, deep diuing, subtle fish, And ablest to resolue vs. Come then show The life you lead, and learne our liues to know. The Lamprey soone consents. And first the Mole Doth thus begin. Deare friends I left my hole To breath the open ayre (whose light I hate) T'acquaint yee with the blessings of my state. And to perswade ye, if you loue your rest To liue with me in peace, and plenty blest. It fits me first to speake, for I had first My being, long before the earth was curst. Darkenesse was not created; tis as old As that great workeman which the whole doth mold But light was made long after, and doth show, That ignorance is elder then to know. The workmans selfe in cloudy darknes keeps; For no eye sees or when he wakes or sleepes. He loues not euery curious foole should see What ioyes, what treasures, in obliuion bee. The worthy Grecian would haue learn'd that Art, For ignorance is wisdoms better part. When all was Chaos first the Center stood, And all the solide parts, call'd Earth. The flood Was next being ponderous. The ayre flew higher; And as a hedge to all was placed fire. What first was plac'd was worthiest, &amp; brought forth The first of creatures, and best things of worth. And first it brought forth things that were below; The roote had life, before the fruit did grow. And we (earths darlings) had our shape within Ere you without. Nor doe th'effects of sin (Ambitious sin which light and knowledge sought And (fondly curious) blinde obedience thought A base director) so afflict and kill Vs here within; as you who share in ill Of punishment and guilt, with foolish man; Yet no way from his rule acquit ye can. You dwell with him, and dye with him. But we Are earth by nature, procreated free. And our forefathers customes still obay, Doe as they did, and follow their blind way. Not striuing busily our wits t'approue By searching doubts, but rather shew our loue, By louing euen their errors that are gone, Or reuerently beleeuing they had none. Our dyet is most choice, on rootes to feed, And rellish first the sweet of euery seed. You liue on th'excrement, and do not know, That fundamentall vertue springs below. Besides you liue like slaues, but I am free, Though bloudy-minded Man oft seeks for me. The Lyon did pretend because I haue Foure feet, that I by nature was his slaue: He call'd for this a Councell, sent for me To sweare to his seruile supremacie. But I (refusing th'othe) to spite him more Did vndermine his Councell-chamber flore And had not light (damn'd light) my plot bewraide He had to hell sunke by the traine I laide. But light discouered me, and since that deed I loath light more, and so in darknesse breed. Darknes thou sweet companion, friend of sleepe, How I delight in thee. With thee doth keepe All that man seeks for, euery secret plot, Darke mysterie, close stratagem; what not? Inuisible wealth, with treasures manifold, But chiefe Mans soule, his god, almighty gold. This Man knowes well, and knowing learnes of me To dig and delue till in his graue he be. Then all proclaime him happy: say he is At peace and rest, and doth enioy all blisse. And such say truth: for he returnes againe To his first being, and doth so remaine. “Contentment with darke ignorance doth dwell, “And light and knowledge only maketh hell. Then without farther strife liue all with mee, If you will taste no paines, nor errors see. The changeable Chamelion laught out-right, To heare the blinde Mole raile so much at light. And said; Your darker spirits can't conceiue, The blessed fruit, that we from light receiue. Let fooles depend on faith implicatiue, Wise-men into the depth of truth will diue. Darknesse and ignorance, which you suppose Had an eternall being, are the foes Of all eternall beings; and indeed Are voide in nature without fruit, root, seed. Darknesse is but the absence of cleare light. As error is the ignorance of right. So these two are vacuities, want being; Not seene by others, nor yet others seeing. From nothing, nothing springs; something there was From whence this vniuersall frame, this Masse Of strange agreeing contrarieties, Had essence: and 'twas something that had eyes: For sure it was not ignorance, nor night, They could not see to order things so right. But it was knowledge, wisedome, light, and truth, Figur'd immature age, and actiue youth. The priuiledge you plead, Antiquitie, Proues onely, that of old you vs'de to lye; And that all truth you hate, for truth doth run Still to the light, and you the light do shun. And where you challenge your creation first; It is not like, Nature would make the worst Before the best; except this can preferre Your claime, that as young workemen vse to erre In their first workes; so Nature first did try To make right eyes, by making yours awry. Much rather truth it is, she did bestow, Labour in framing others; but for you, She left you to corruption, night, and chance, Which made your eies such, such your countenance. And your tame-blinde obedience well befits Such earth-bred, doltish, dull, and sluggish wits. But ayerie Spirits acquainted with the light, Will not be led by custome from the right. No loue, no friends, no predecessor shall Peruert their iudgements; they examine all. And for the food ye boast to eat boast still; No root, herbe, fruit of yours, I handle will. They are corrupted. Ayre doth only giue True nourishment, and happiest meanes to liue. The sick-man shewes this, who the weather fayre, Remooues for health, from close to th'open ayre. And for the light, your death doth it approoue; When only then your eyes are seen to moue. Then you begin to see, and loath the kinde Which being blind themselues brought you vp blind, Bereauing you of many a blessed sight, Which we enioy, who loue and liue in light. Your freedom from all beasts I like. T'is ill To be subiected to anothers will: But that to your superiors I do hate, And therefore am exilde from euery state: I liue a poore thin creature, by the ayer; My selfe I feed with hopes, others with prayer. My eyes I oft lift vp, and roole about, Desiring to be seen to be deuout. But neither with my bulke, nor with my backe Supply the least defect of others lacke. I beare no Wooll to clothe, no flesh to feed; Let sheep, and Calues, releeue the poore that need. I rauisht go with a distracted looke, And turne my mind, still, as I turne my booke, My will doth lead my conscience, not my wit. And euery riddle for my purpose fit: Hating whats'ere is old, I loue the new And to all purposes, change my ready hue. My flesh is low, my spirit high and prowd Doth contradict what order hath allow'd. I fast when others feast, feast when they fast, And with Angelicall food, I do out-last All Gormandizers. Come then, liue with me All that loue life, and light, and would be free. The Salamander hearing this discourse, Sayd, Sure you both do argue without force. Darke ignorance our nature doth contemne: And curious search wise Magistrates condemne By blindnesse we our wants and dotage shew: To those, not reuerence but reproch is due. Not priuatiue blindnesse, our antiquitie showes, But onely that which by long seeing growes. But you blinde Mole do ignorance affect, Which breeds derision, scorne and dis-respect. For what a senselesse part is this in you, Your fathers faults and errours to allow? And not much rather to reforme your owne, By shunning the defects, which they haue showne? Your food is grosse and earthly; dirt and mould Mixt with old roots, do much corruption hold. Yet (though they gin to die, with age and wither) The good with bad (being old) you cram togither. This makes my fiery spirit scorne to keep In your darke celles, where knowledge seems to sleep. But you Chameleon with a hand too bold, Oppose, contemne, and scorne, whats'ere is old. You onely loue to see, but not to doo, You dote on knowledge and on error too. “T'is error, in our sight to ouerweene, “And but our owne, all iudgements dis-esteeme: “T'is error to be fondly ouer-wise, “Too pure, too iust, too perfect, too precise. There is a meane. For knowledge sure doth liue “Onely, where it doth good to others giue. You too too sawcie hidden secrets handle, And too too fond your owne conceits doe dandle, And cocker with obseruance: being so A friende to superstition, though a foe. The light you vse, is borrowed not your owne, The colours that you see, their ground vnknowne. Your darke imperfect, double glimmering sight, Is but th'extended beames of greater light. Arising from vicinitie of fire, To which the purest elements aspire In their refined parts; the earth in gold And pretious stones, doe most resemblance hold; The sea in salt, in Pearles, in dewes that rise, And to the Sonne-ward with ambition flies; The Ayre in colous and in Meteors bright, Which the Sunnes place vsurpe in darkest night. Tis fire alone that searcheth and refines, And doth diuide the grosse from purer mines. Tis fire that makes grasse, herbe, and tree to grow: Meltes the seas Icie chaines, and th'earths cold snow. It cheares the young, it cherisheth the old, Reuiues the dying, makes the Coward bold. Nothing without it can be said to liue, Whats'ere hath being, it doth glory giue. Which makes me to determine, that the light Which you inuisible call, is but a sprite Made by your feare, and strong imagination, Without true being, essence, or foundation. For light the greater 'tis, doth more appeare; So should that light of lights, if such there were. My iudgement therefore in this rule doth runne, There's nothing greater then the glorious Sunne, Here I set downe my rest. And for the schooles, That teach beleefe, let them still tutor fooles. From your contention, my instruction sprung; And thus I learn'd to thinke when I was young. The Mole doth feede too much on earthly meat, And the Chameleon nought but ayre doth eat. I neither like your fast, nor yet your feasting, For twixt you two all earnest turnes to ieasting. And doth perswade me thinke, there is no food, In earth or ayre, that doth or hurt, or good. So all my knowledge, practise, life, doth chime, According to the current, state, and time. I thinke they'r only gulls that liue in awe Of any thing but want, death, and the law. I quench all fiery zeal wheres'ere I come; And would haue Policie speake, Religion dumbe. I poyson with my breath, both foe and friend, And to my pleasure doe each proiect bend: In briefe I onely am a freeman borne, Who loue my selfe alone, and others scorne. The Lamprey hearing this damn'd Atheist tell, A tale befitting none but Machiuael, Thrust his eye-guarded head aboue the brim, Of the rug'd waues, and to the shore did swim. And on his slippery belly gan to slide, Till he came neere the Salamanders side. Thou cursed slaue (quoth he) though I proceed From some of thy neere kin, of serpents seed. And am halfe serpent, as thou wholly art, Yet I am halfe a fish; and euen that part Prouokes me contradict the cursed note, Which thou didst vomit from thy venomd throat. Thy Pedigree is lineally deriued From that great Serpent, which at first depriued The rest of feet; and being ouer-wise Gull'd credulous man of glorious paradise. Still thou partak'st that nature, and each tree, Thy tongue or teeth touch, so infected be In root and fruit, that who so eats doth die, Poyson'd b'accurst, cold infidelitie. Too light beleefe, and too too earnest thirst Of curious knowledge, causde death enter first: But now thy skill hath brought it so about, That hearing, seeing, feeling, still we doubt. And flying one extreame, we fondly fall Into the contrary; wise, fooles, and all. “Yet blindnesse better is, then hauing eyes, “Not t'acknowledge truthes, but count them lyes. “T'is better to be doubtfull what we know, “Then to be Truthes profest and open foe. The Mole and the Chameleon better are, And neerer truth, then thou thy selfe by farre. Yet the Chameleon somewhat doth resemble Thy nature, but he can more close dissemble. He is not so prophane, so impious, bold, To call all truth in doubt, both new and old; Though he giues darknesse not the praise he ought, And too too curious, after knowledge sought: Yet he confesseth that there is a light He cannot see, through th'impotence of sight. But you all light and knowledge do confine Within the Sunne, as if it were diuine: And like a desperate traytor, foolish theefe, From art and nature steale, to kill beleefe. Come then good fellowes (quoth the Lamprey) take This monster vp against vs; let vs make Him an example of our iustice showne, Vpon Truthes foe, so manifestly knowne. With that he nimbly twines himselfe about The Salamander (being quicke and stout:) Chameleon and the Mole, the Lamprey aide Which makes the Salamander much dismay'd. Yet he doth lay about with tongue, teeth, nailes, And bites them all, but oddes at length preuailes. And they remaining victors cast him downe From the steepe cliffe, and so the Atheist drowne. Then comming backe, they two the Lamprey pray His wise opinion of their strife to say: That they may know to which part he enclines Whether to darknesse, or where splendor shines. He soone consents, and tells how he (by kinde Bred and brought vp in mud) is of the minde The Mole spake truth. For happinesse (quoth he) “Consists in what we haue, not what we see. And sight prouokes vs wish, and couet change And so in boundlesse, endlesse, toyle we range. “He that knowes most, knowes best what he doth misse, “The losse of Paradise is only this. “The simple innocent truth this instance fameth; “Man in the darke being naked nothing shameth. Thus he discourst, then tells how he behaues Himselfe in darknesse, vnderneath the waues. How he prefers old Ignorance, before New Knowledge, and (I wot) knowes cause therefore. Shewes how for this opinion he was brought Before the Whale, yet long in vaine was sought: Tells how he scapes the search by many creeks And winding holes, when Hippia him seeks: For they (Phœnician Crefishes being swift) Are Purseuants which he can hardly shift: Yet he hath learned counsell, who directs His whole proceeding when he ought suspects. First subtle Polypus to whom he cleaues, And seeming part of him the search deceaues. The turbulent Cuttle, who doth raise the mud, And such a colour mingle with the flood, That no eye can discouer where he lies, And so he often scapes the craftie spies. Then creepes to stones that lye on silt and sand, (Not to the corner-stone on stedfast land:) And if by chance they finde him spite of these, And so attach him, then he can with ease Slip through their fingers, or himselfe vnwinde, By leauing some part of his slime behinde. He can equiuocate, and double so, That euery way at once he seemes to go. Yet once he taken was, and brought to triall, Where with his doubtfull answers, stiffe deniall, Low crowching, smoth conueyance, flattering guise He scap't th'Exchequer, Prison, and th'Assise. Then being askt, why darker ignorance Before the light he did in speech aduance. He answers, first it was to try his wit; Not that he held it, to be true or fit. Againe, because small vse of light he had, He to make some fooles like himselfe was glad. With these flye answers, and great friends beside, And faithfull bribes, he did from danger glide: And such fee'd friends he had in euery Court, And euery office, at the least report Of threatned danger rounded him in th'eare To shift his seat, before the storme came neare. Then shewes he how the better to disguise His double face, he had two rowes of eyes: [illeg.] though he lou'd all knowledge, and all light. But (quoth he) only two of these haue sight; The rest are hypocriticall and blind: ?Yet? their appearance calmes the Whales fierce mind Whose easie nature open to abuse, [illeg.]akes! shew for substance, colour for excuse. ?I? thus adapt and frame my selfe to follow The Whales command, although my heart be hollow, [illeg.] liue at quiet, offices obtaine, [illeg.]lace in the warres, and in the Coram gaine. [illeg.]ll which shall turne vnto the Whales destruction: [illeg.] euer great fish, mooue but insurrection: [illeg.]or I'le discouer all when time shall fit; Who trusts a halfe friend, hath not halfe his wit. Whil'st thus he argu'd, and the Mole grew proud, To heare affected ignorance allow'd: And that so many in that large dominion, Remain'd vpholders of his stiffe opinion. The thinne Chameleon gan looke bigge and swell, And each complain'd himselfe he was not well, But then too late, they found how they were stung And poyson'd by the Salamanders toung. There was no helpe, but die they must. In vaine They weepe; and each to other shew their paine, Till Iustice did by death their paine conclude, With tragicke end closing their interlude. Struthiocamelus. DEDICATED To the vertuous Knight, Sir Iohn Heueningham, and his charitable Lady. VVhat on our selues we spend, doth through vs pass And leaue vs naked, as this Ostrich was: This makes you on the poore bestow so much, And no expence but owne your selues to grutch. A wealthy Marchant late in Barbary, Through sandy desarts passing; chanc't to spy An Ostrich eating iron which he found, By Trauellers scattered vpon the ground: Quoth then this Merchant; prithee let me know, What nourishment, can from those mettals grow? The Ostrich answers; Sir I do not eat This iron, as you thinke I do, for meate. I only keepe it, lay it vp in store, To helpe my needy friends, and friendlesse poore. I often meete (as farre and neere I goe) Many a fowndred horse that wants a shooe: Seruing a Master that is money-lesse: Such I releeue and helpe in their distresse. With trauellers I meete that are beset By theeues and robbers often. Then I beget My selfe among the thickest, and present Out of my maw a pistoll ready bent, A sword and dagger, or some such like toole, To help the true man, and the theefe to coole. The Merchant mus'de (as well he might) at this, And thought within himselfe; this fellow is Most fit for my imployment, I will straight Hire him to be my Bailiefe. No deceit Lurkes in his simple shew; he'le surely keepe, My plow-yrons, when my lazie hindes do sleepe. This to the Ostrich motion'd, he agrees, The wages are set downe, the vailes, the fees, The liuory, with circumstance enough, And they come home. And now God speed the plough The Ostrich carefully laies vp the rakes, The pitch-forke teines, the yron-pointed stakes, The wedges, hammer, hatchet, and the nailes, The sithe, the sickle, and the biles of pailes, The share, the coulter, heele-yorne, and the cocke, The whip, the horse-shooe, with the key and locke. He needs no locke and key to keepe them vnder, But keeps both lock &amp; key, where you wold wonder. Then comes into the house, puts vp the gun, The sword and dagger; and when this is done, Deuoures the dripping-pan, the cob-irons, spit, And swallowes all the iron bit by bit. The Merchant prais'd his fortune, that he had Got one so good, 'mongst many seruants bad. Told him he shortly would his state preferre, From being Bailiffe, to be Treasurer; For he could not inuent a surer hold, Then th'Ostrich had for siluer, or for gold. And now the Merchant leauing one at home, That he may well trust, goes abroad to rome: Neglects his house and lands, thinkes all is well, And as he wont to doe, doth buy and sell. Mongst other things he sold, because the warres Began afresh, he truct for yron barres. For he was one of those that would for gaine: Sell bullets, where they were shot home againe, And did our Mines and Woods on Ordnance wast, Which spite of lawes, he to the Enemie past, Much yrone he had at home, and sold beside All kinde of armour fit for such a tide. So home he comes glad of so good a mart, For here he knowes the Ostrich playes the part Of a good Bailiffe. He may easily thriue, When such a full winde doth his fortune driue. His land he finds vntill'd, he wonders then And thinkes the fault rests on his lazy Men. They say they wanted yrons for the plough, He wonders, for the Bailiffe had enough. He findes his house all naked, not a bit Of meate prepar'd, the Cooke wants pot, and spit. He goes to bed, the theeues assault his house: He hath no weapon to resist a Mouse. He riseth early, lookes for his munition, The place remaines, no yron in fruition. His barres are gone, his houshold-stuffe, and all, Now to account his Bayliffe he doth call. The Seruants ioyne in their petition first, And shew their griefes, how hard he was, and curst. How he kept backe their wages and their meate, And gaue them worke, but gaue them not to eate. How he neere hand had made a monstrous neast, Where whilst they fasted, he and his did feast. And thither he conuaide the yron worke Where the she Ostrich and his young did lurke; Who swallow'd all: for they haue mawes as large As culuerings, which would as soone discharge The yron loade; and sooner farre would spend, And bring a world of wealth to lauish end. The Ostrich to excuse himselfe bewraies The place where safely he this yron layes. Carries him to a priuate hole, where still He dung'd, when he his maw did ouer-fill. Quoth he if you can good distinction make, Each seuerall peece you may from hence vptake. The plow-geares, cart-geares, and the toole for war, Spits, pots, and cobirons, here together are. Each wedge, knife, hammer, and the smallest naile, Drawne lymbick wise through stomacke, guts &amp; taile It's a rare chymicall extraction now, Better then all the drugs the Mount-bankes show. It passeth our elixar, or the stone Sought for by many, but attaind by none. Th'obstruction of the Liuer, and the spleene, It opens, mollifies, and purgeth cleane. A secret t'is assured, for madnesse, folly, Wild iealousie, and cloudy melancholly, It cures the Gout, and qualifies the cause, Suppling a hide-bound purse like th'oile of lawes: It dries vp humours, humours that abound, And mans weake body it makes safe and sound. The merchant stood amaz'd, but at the last, He seazde vpon the Ostrich, held him fast: Made him be tide behinde a horse, and stript, (His buttocks bare as now they be) and whipt. Ransackt his neast, and brake before his face His egs, though his poore Hen in hope of grace, Did sue for their repriuall. But in vaine, He lookes to finde his Iron there againe. Which missing he proceedes, exiles him quite, And then vpon his gate this note doth write. Let Rich-men wisely feare, All such as feathers weare, It's lost whats'ere they borrow, And soone their mawes goes thorow: The substance they consume To nought but smoke and rheume; But th' vse they neuer faile To pay with tongue and taile. The Ostrich euer since his breeches lost, Goes like a naked rogue at whipping post. He hates a horse to death since he was stript, And for his fault, ti'de at his taile and whipt. He hides his egges, and couers them from sight, Lest man should find &amp; break them. Thus they write. ONOCROTALVS. DEDICATED TO THE RIGHT hopefull Knight, Sir Thomas Sovthvvell. Your name hath long been mist, now fairely rise And make your Country flourish. All our eyes Are cast vpon your actions; then on vs Reflect your loue. Shun Onocrotalus. VVhilome within the Persian gulfe did haunt A fowle much like our greedy Cormorant, Cal'd Onocrotalus, who vsde to prey, On fish, or fowle, or beast which past his way. He had a crop vnder his bosome wide, In compasse like a sacke, and thereto side. Much harme and spoile he did, for none could passe But fild his pouch, if bird, beast, fish, it was. At length th'oppressed birds, with fish, and beast, Petition to their Soueraignes, and request Aide and protection gainst the open wrong, This tyrant daily did, and had done long. The beasts vnto the Lyon made complaint. Birds to the Eagle. Fishes did acquaint The Seas great Emperour the Whale. with griefe, They all sustain'd, and all implor'd reliefe. Long was it ere they could be heard, for still, The Cormorant, (for so we call him will) Had many friends in euery Court, which he Maintainde with large shares, and full liberall fee. For still his gorge full laden, ready stood, And when they mist else-where they here had food: Food of each kinde, for euery stomacke fit, And such as fauorites were, had part of it. Long thus he put them off, yet at the last, By counter-bribes, their weake petitions past. The Eagle first did seeke him, and he found, The theefe where he would wish, vpon the ground, Quoth he, well met, are you the fowle that prey, Vpon our harmlesse subiects night and day, That none can this way passe and vse his trade, But is a subiect to your fury made? Not I sir (quoth the Cormorant) I am one, That liue in contemplation all alone. This poke I begge with, to sustaine my need, And I no fowle am but a beast indeed. Quoth then the Eagle, wherefore serue thy wing? O (quoth the Cormorant) thou mighty king Of feathered fowles, these two are my forefeet, Held vp to honor thee, with reuerence meete. And that thou maist be full resolu'd, and know. That I vnto the Lyon duty owe, As subiects to their Soueraignes, not to thee, Without thou wilt vsurpe authoritie, And into other neighbour Realmes incroch (Which to thy Iustice were a fowle reproch) Heare but my voice. With that he steps aside, And in the water thrusts his wezand wide, And like an Asse gan bray. The Eagle straight Hearing his voice, suspected no deceit, But past away to seeke what now he saw. When the late noyse he made did thither draw The kingly Lyon, who did hunt about, As th'other did to finde th'oppressor out. And when he spide him; What art thou quoth he The beast gainst whom so many plaine to me? O noble Lyon, quoth the Cormorant, I am a fish, the water still I hant. And here I take my food, and lead my life, Free from oppression, and each cause of strife. Why, quoth the Lyon, now I heard thee bray Like to an Asse. True, True, my Lord ye say, (Quoth this smooth hypocrite) for I would faine Be like an Asse, so innocent and plaine. I loue beasts well, and next your excellence, The humble Asse, for still his patience. And now to put your highnesse out of doubt, Behold me swimme and diue, (so launcht he out Far from the Lyons reach) If beasts quoth he, Can swimme and diue thus, I a beast may be. With that he diues, saying, Sir fare you well, Your faire commends to the King Whale I'le tell. The Lyon parted thence; the Whale that way Had sought this Monster all the liue-long day; And seeing such an vncouth thing glide past, Within his Kingdome, with such nimble hast; He call'd and bad him stay, and will'd him tell, If he were Onocrotalus, that fell And cruell murtherer, who hauocke made Of all that in that wealthy Rode did trade? O mighty Emperour (aloud he cri'de) I hardly scap't euen now his cursed pride For being by my noble Master sent, (The Eagle King of fowles) you to present With birds and other iunkets in my crop, He needs would me from your glad presence stop; And but he heard you comming, I surmise, His lawlesse force had made me lawfull prize. Quoth then the Whale, I search to meete that slaue. But what art thou that canst so well behaue, Thy tayle and nimble fins? Art not a fish? That I were such (quoth he) it is my wish. I like thy milder reigne where subiects say, For loue, and not for dread, they thee obey. And would arm'd in white scales, if I might choose Serue thee a fish, and my blacke feathers loose. But Nature this forbids; yet still I striue, Euen from my youth, fish-like to swim and diue: And vnderstand their language, and conuerse With them whose ciuill manners, are lesse fierce Then beasts or birds be. For they drinke far more And eat much lesse, then we doe on the shore. This drinking I delight in, and haue tride, By all good meanes to make my belly wide. Yet see, I am a fowle. So vp he hies, And takes his wings with speede, and far thence flies? The Whale then found his cunning and straight sent A priuy letter of his close intent, Both to the Eagle and the Lyon stout, To meet and ioyne, and finde this Out-law out. They met, and ioynd, and then this Out-law found Nor in the Sea, nor yet vpon the ground: Nor flying in the aire, but in a hold, A hollow tree, whose strength made braggard bold. They spoke him faire, but he discerned plaine, Their drift, and cride: Faire words make Idiots faine. They threatned him, but threats he doth deride, And saith, by threatning words none euer dyde. The Eagle would haue ventred on his neast, But he his bill held right vpon his breast, Like a stiffe souldiers pike, sharpe, long, and armd; And no way but right downe he could be harmd. The Lyon would haue torne with teeth and nailes The tree vp by the roote, but wanted sailes To swim so farre, for it in waters stood. The Whale then thought to tosse it in the flood, But in a rocke it grew, and growing so, He bad them do their worst, he fear'd no foe. They saide, they would besiedge and starue him out; He laught amaine, and shew'd how gainst that doubt He was prouided, hauing store to serue So long, till if they staid, they all would starue. Then each bethought himselfe of many a wile And war-like stratagem, how to beguile This politique Rebell, and to force him yield Or starue within, or venter to the field. All workes the ayre, the water, or the land Did ere produce, these Captaines vnderstand: But none found able to enforce his strength: The warlike Lyon yet conceiu'd at length How to effect it. Great confederates heare, (Quoth he) what I propound. There's nought I feare But what I speake of. Once I did rebell Against out Generall Soueraigne Man: to tell This fault doth touch my honour, but you all, I know haue been co-partners in my fall, And his most gracious pardon. Then, O then I kept within my fort, a hideous den Caru'd out of rocke it was; and no way he Could force me out, or make assault on me. At last with indignation mou'd, he takes A mighty flint vp, and with hurling, breakes The same against a rocke, which flying sings, And sparkles from the ayre betwixt them springs As from a red-hot yron, when a Smith With heauy hammer beats it on a stith. Neere hand he had before laid leaues with rosse From Okes torne with a Northern blast, and mosse Dride in the parching Sun: and wood which dide By killing age, and stood my den beside. The sparks inflam'd this stuffe, which in the mouth Of my darke Caue he plac'd: the winde then South Forc'd in the smoke, and this ayre-thickning smoke Infor'd me thus, either come out or choke. The issue you remember: this alone Must be our proiect now; or Art hath none. Hie therefore braue-bird brother, quickly take Twixt your strong tallents this great flint, and make Experience of my plot. Mount with it hie And let it fall, that fire may from it flie: Which kindled once, fan gently with your wing, And cherish with soft breath: then let the king Of fishes with his mighty nostrels puffe Till it flames fiercely, and burnes hot enough. This counsell they applaud; but th'Eagle thought How purer, hotter, flames might soone be fought: And vp he nimbly sores the milke-white way, Where (being a minion knowne) he findes no stay; Each dore flies ope alone, till to the eare Of mighty Ioue he gets, and let him heare His businesse and his suite, which was for fire And thunderbolts; Ioue grants his full desire. Downe quickly he descends and makes a traine About the place where this theefe doth remaine: Then powder he applies vnto the root Oft' hollow tree, and thence the slaue doth shoot. He shoots him thence into the ayre as hye, As th'Eagles selfe could follow with his eye. And downe he comes and doth descend the deep, Where the still Center doth no motion keep. Then vp againe aboue the swelling maine, He bounds, there floting without sense or paine. And ere he can recouer labouring breath, That's loth to part, the Whale from vnderneath The traytor doth attach, and straightway brings To be arrayn'd before the other Kings. Him they examine, but he will confesse No truth, but what they know as he doth ghesse. Then they doe racke him (being rent before) Yet he no truth, but many a lye doth rore. Till with the violent torture and constraint, Life almost failing, and with sufferings faint, His gorge he vomits and bewraies with paine The truth, for which they sought so long in vaine. And first (preposterously) he casteth out, All slimy lubricke meats, Eele, Gudgeon, Trout; The Citie heires, Gilt-head and Golden-eye, Belonging to the Sea-kings soueraignty. And with this euidence conuict, the tryall Proceeds to proue him guilty in denyall Of farther wrongs done. The Wood-cocke, Parret, The Goose, the Dotterell, Iack-daw prone to parret, The Sea-gull and the Cinclos weake and friendlesse, And of poore widdow-Turtles numbers endlesse, With diuers subiects to the royall Eagle, He doth as easily voide, as erst inueagle. Yet still vnto the Lyon he denies Himselfe a trespasser, but all those lyes He lately made, and late was taken in, Afford presumption of his farther sinne. For which againe they racke him one pin higher, And then he vtters more then they desire. A foolish Cony, and an innocent Lambe, A credulous Calfe new weaned from the dam, And yet in wardship; a ridiculous Mouse For feare of Cats leauing her sheltring house: And last of all, (for which the Lyon greeued) A Hare, from execution oft repreeued. All these with easie vtterance, doth declare That he did fowle, nor beast, nor fishes spare But preide on all, and so became a prey To the Eagle, Whale, and Lyon, eu'ry way. Which prou'de and made by demonstration plaine, Beyond the power of impudence to faine: He then excepts against th'vndue proceeding, They in his apprehension vsde, not heeding The law of Nations, but by force constraining (Himselfe) an others subiect, remaining In peace, and league with them, to be arrayn'd Like to a Traytor, and with tortures payn'd. He saith the place he kept in was without Their iurisdiction, and he made no doubt To proue it with large priuiledges blessed A sanctuarie for the poore distressed. They slight his cauils; And the Whale demands In whose vnknowne, strange gouernment it stands If not in one of theirs? For ayre, earth, sea, And all they haue (but Man and what Mans be), Doe properly belong to one of these, Who may dispose of all, as they best please. I pray then (quoth the Cormorant) relate To whose Emperiall crowne, and to whose state, My enuy'd neast belongs? which of you three Claime th'interest as Lord by right of fee? For if it proper be to one, the rest Haue done much wrong, t'vsurp his interest Whose it should be. This question he did make Hoping thereby their setled loues to shake By couetous ambition, whilst they all Would make their claimes, and so asunder fall. But the foreseeing Eagle bids him minde His owne affaires, and not to thinke t'vnwinde The snares true Iustice laies about his life, But interposing such slight cause of strife Betwixt such firme friends, in strong league combinde And with all strength of entercourse entwinde. And yet to satisfie this curious doubt, Know (quoth the Eagle) that being hem'd about With floting waters, it belongs to him Who gouerns all that in the waters swim. But as it on the stedfast earth doth stand, It longs to him that is the king of land. And the large tree which spreads his spacious bowes In th'open ayre, within my kingdome growes. Thy neast thus longs to all of vs, thy food Stolne from our subiects, in th'ayre, earth, flood: And thou thy selfe must needs, if thou beest either Beast, bird, or fish, be one of ours; if neither, Say what thou art, or whose thou art; for all But Man and Monsters in this number fall. Then (quoth the Cormorant) I doe belong Vnto the fearefull Dragon, whose blacke tongue Threats death to each of you, and keeps in awe Your humbler spirits, making his will your law, He is the king of serpents, whose strong breath Confounds your strength with all-subduing death. He rules the vpper region, purging fire Which searcheth hell, and doth to heau'n aspire. This, this alone it was which I obay'd When that strong law vnto my neast you layd. But you that sprightly power by intrusion Falsely vsurpt to my deuout confusion. Fire onely to the Dragon doth belong; To him, and vnto me, you haue done wrong. To him I doe appeale; and haue resort In this great cause to his infallible Court. This speech inflam'd their hearts with heat &amp; scorne To be confronted thus, thus ouerborne By a base villaine who did proudly brag on The free protection of their foe the Dragon. So with a full resolue, they all agree Each for himselfe and his reueng to bee. The Lyon takes, feet, head and throat away: With those he walk't and like an Asse did bray. The Eagle seaseth on his wings and taile, With these he bird-like in the ayre did saile. The Whale his body swallowes at a bit Which he vs'de fish-like, diu'd and swam with it. Thus Traytor-like hee's quarter'd out and caru'd; Would land and water Pyrats were so seru'd. Epimythium. The water Pyrat euery one doth know They rob our Marchants, and allegeance owe To no command; dutie to none will giue, But out-lawes, like the sea wherein they liue. Our Pyrats on the land haue sundry kinds, And sundry obiects. Our goods, bodies, minds. Law-state-Church Pyrats, when no Church, state, law, Can their irregular liues to fashion draw. The first pretending gouernment of all, And freeing such as into danger fall; Doe kill in curing, and oppresse with easing Both the delinquent, and the free displeasing. The second guard our land from forraigne force, Whilst they themselues (perhaps) afflict vs worse. Strangers may not deuoure vs, yet we are By peace eat vp, more then we wont by warre. The third are of two kinds; our owne and others, Who not in doctrine, but in fact are brothers. Our owne feed few (for the dumb dog still lurches) They'le not teach one, but swallow many Churches: They vnto ignorance our soules betray, And to seducing diuells giue silent way. The other knowes, no king, but knowes their subiects, And faines to reconcile, but make them abiects. No place is priuileg'd, no law, no Nation: For all the world his parish is and station. Rome giues him licence, and although he swim In the whole sea, there is no roome for him. He cries where s'ere he comes; Al's mine, giue room; And if it be opposde a fatall doom Becomes his vsher. Kings must kisse his foot, If curses, pistolls, poyson, hell can doo't; But if nor these, nor hell, then Faux more skilfull Will charme the open earth, blow vp the wilfull. These Cormorants my bleare-eyde Muse hath spide: But there are many Cormorants beside. The ASSE. DEDICATED. TO THE LEARNED and iudicious Knight S?. Hamond Le-Strange. Some beasts are ominous some birds are so, But Massolanus and your selfe say no. Hee slew the Augurs bird; My silly Asse. May to a wise-man without perill passe. Although in Italy, in France, and Spaine, And all those hotter Regions, there remaine Great store of Asses? and with vs but few, Saue some that our late Trauellers do shew. And though the Pope and Romane Clergie ride In euery lowly, patient, humble pride Vpon these beasts, or on their bastards rather, As fits each single, simple, holy father. I would not haue you thinke my meaning such A beast of theirs or of our owne to touch. The Asse I talke of, bred in Thessaly Came to a country man, a neighbour by And made great mone, that euery sauage beast In woods and fields, the greatest and the least Misus'de him, wrongd him, made it all their sport To trouble him, who had no remedy for't. The Man seemde pittifull, enclind to good, And gaue the Asse aduice to leaue the wood, To dwell with him who able was and strong, His weake Retainers to protect from wrong. True (quoth the Asse) your wit, your strength I know, But how can I deserue the grace and shew? What benefit or pleasure whilst I liue Can I doe you, who must my liuelyhoood giue? Quoth Man, for my protection, and my meat You shall affoard me but your dung and sweat, Those excrements t'inrich and lust my ground, That it with corne and vintage may abound. And when I chance to trauell farre and nye, You like a friend, shall beare me company. The Asse was glad the couenants were so good, And straight agrees, nor long consulting stood. The articles were drawne, read openly, Sealed and deliuered interchangable. And home they goe, and long together dwelt Without repentance; neither greeuance felt. But man in innocence remain'd not long, And since is apt to doe all innocence wrong. Sure here it fell out so. The crafty Man Wo say and vnsay, lye, and cauill can, Went to the Asse, and (all inrag'd) demands? Why all that while he had not dung'd his lands? Sir (quoth the Asse) such compasse as I yield I haue with daiely care laid in your field. True (quoth the Man) but that will not suffice To dung my ground, that plenty may arise; Yet so you vndertooke. Then out of hand See you prouide enough to serue my land. And yeeld what you keepe backe good store of sweat Or Ile giue store of blowes, but not of meat. The Asse finds he is wrong'd, but sees not how To right himselfe; weake men to stronger bow. He does what man commands, and rather more Till Man grows rich, and so grows proud, with store. Then man must trauaile, must his kinsfolke see And other countries how they fashion'd be. The Asse must goe with him, so 'twas agreed To beare him company. Well mote they speed, The Man a saddle sets vpon his backe, A halter on his head, which wit doth lacke. What meane you master (quoth the simple Asse) These will but make me weary as I passe? Foole (quoth the Man) thinke you ile haue my Page, Not suited to the fashions of this age? I should be sham'd to see you neere me stand, Without a cloake, and bout your neck a band. Proud was the silly Asse, to heare he stood So high in fauour, and doth onward skud With willing pace, not like a sleepy snaile, But tossing of his eares, winching his taile. Long trauailde they, till to a brook they came, Wherein a many siluer fishes swam. A bridge was neere, but Man withheld his eye, And would not see the bridge, some reason why. The Asse went through the water: quoth he then, All beasts are far more happier than all Men. You are by nature safely cloth'd, and armde, Gainst cold, heat, drought, and wet; we easly harmde With any small annoyance. You are free, And gainst all these extreames must patient be. The Asse being prais'd, vpon no ground stood still, But must turne backe againe to shew his skill, To boast his valour, let his Master know All his good parts, and seruices arow. Now sir, quoth he, you on my backe I'le beare, Safe o're this water. Get vp, nothing feare. The Man leapt lightly vp. Dissimulation “Doth neither stirrup need, nor great perswasion. The Asse doth quickly passe the Riuer. Then He stayes, and prayes him light. No, (saith the Man) Proceed vpon your iourney you can beare, I dare not light, to fall I stand in feare. I'le kneele then (quoth the Asse) and down he kneels, The Man straight raisde him with his whip and heels. O Master (quoth the Asse) you promisde meat, Your couenant giues no liberty to beat. Foole (quoth the Man) the word expresly meant, Wages for worke implies a punishment For sluggishnesse and sloth; make haste away, Our businesse and the time permits no stay. So on they goe, till th' Asse now almost tyred, Askt pitty of the Man, and ease desired, That he would daigne a little while to light. The Man denide it, and then laught out-right. And doubled blowes with whip, with heele, &amp; staffe. O tyrant (quoth the Asse) dost fight and laugh? Are these th'effects of promises and words? Is this the peace your law, bond, faith, affords? Keep you your couenants thus? O man thinke how You make vs traytors, when you, breake your vow. Why (quoth the Man) my couenants are vnbroke, I haue performde whatsere I wrote or spoke. I giue you meat, my meaning likevvise vvas, To giue you blovves, if that you plaide the Asse. I was to haue your excrements and sweat. I cannot haue those but by vvorke and heat, Therefore I ride you. You were to attend In all my iourneyes on me like a friend. And vvhat is liker to a friend I pray, Then a mans drudge, that toyles both night &amp; day? That carries him through thicke and thin vvith paine, And a sure stud for all turnes doth remaine? O (quoth the Asse) the vvorld vvas neuer good, Since other on mentall reseruation stood. I only vvas to beare you company, True (quoth the Man) to beare, that's carry me. O damn'd equiuocation, vvho at first, (quoth the poore Asse) this double Doctrine nurst? No Merchant, Tradesman, Lavvyer, nor Diuine, Though much fr? truth they warp, fr? grace decline, Could be the authors of this ample euill, But truthes professed foe, that iugling deuill. That Diuell who taught it first, and practiz'd too, In paridise, vnto our generall woe. That Diuell which doth renue in euery age, By this alone his kingdome and image. For without this his kingdome would decay, And without this his image weare a way. This onely murthers truth, opposeth faith, Deceiuing, whether true or false it saith. If true we dare not trust it fearing ill. If false, like truth it looks, and tempts vs will. Quoth Man, thou preachest well; and well mightst passe Couldst thou speake Latin too, to say a Masse. Thy folly was in fault rashly to draw, Thy articles without aduice at law. There wanted stops, pricks, letters, here and there, And by your leaue some words the truth to cleere. Nay quoth the Asse, had euery word, stop, letter, Been left vnwritten my estate were better. This is the plague, when power expoundeth lawes Not as the truth requires, but as the cause. When euery letter may an error breed, To helpe the rich, and begger such as need. When tyrants do capitulate and treat Not to conclude, but to deceiue and cheat. When your false minds are candi'de ore with words As your gay sheathes conceale your bloody swords. Now (quoth the Man) I thinke that Balaams Asse, Or golden Apuly's, thy Tutor was. Thou art so eloquent, so learned, witty, As if thou hadst been taught in Athens Citty. In Athens? (quoth the Asse) now I espie, You speake no truth, but when yee thinke to lie. I was a Cockny once, of noble blood, Traind vp in Athens Court, and in the flood of pleasure, bathde my youth, (but not in Art,) Which causde this transformation, teares, and smart. Yet went our Master, and was well allowde. (With many of my kin) in that thicke crowde, When Philip did so learnedly dispute, And made Demosthenes with wonder mute. I was in fauour then, and then did passe, For braue and wise, though now I be an Asse. For no Man ought to iudge by forme, or face, By fauour, or imployment, or by place, Which are the wise and foolish. Dunces oft “Passe by great doctors. Baboones leap aloft. And they may proue like me, (liue to be switcht,) If they my fortune meet, to be bewitcht. How I bewitched was, you now shall heare. There is no true accomplisht Caualere, That hath not trauailde. And the'rs few of these, Which scape bewitching, passing ouer Seas. When I first trauail'd, my braue Spirit did moue, T'attempt great Ladies and to purchace loue. I purcha'st loue so long, till all I had, Was purcha'st from me, and my selfe full glad, To leaue both Court and Citie, and to try, A better Country fortune to espie. With much much toyle, and many courtly shifts, At length I did arriue mongst craggy clifts, And barraine rocks, t'a smoaky house which stood Alone, besides a fearefull desart wood. There with a wither'd witch I long time staid, A Bel-dame that had been Medeaes maid. She turn'd me to an Asse that very day, Th'Odcombian wit, did odly scape away, He may his good shooes praise, pray for his heeles, By those he scap't. And yet I feare he feeles, His braine, was turning, if he euer passe That way againe, he will turne perfect Asse. And so will many more as well as I, Except they stop their eares, as they passe by. No (quoth the Man) this is a pretty fable, Fitting the end, so neere vnto the stable. Ile now alight, we two are perfect friends, My iourney and thy tale together ends. So they went in to rest, but euer since, The Man mounts on the Asse, although he wince. There is no remedy, and he must obay, That's sadled, bridell'd, and bound euery way. He might haue look'd before he made his match: Now ti's too late, when time was past to watch. Yet euer since he letters hates and learning, When ther's no fault in them, but his discerning. He shunneth water too, all that he can, The cause which made him first a slaue to Man. CVRIALE. Dedicated TO the good acceptance of Master Flyode, Admirall to the Queenes Maiestie, and of her Counsell. The Court from Flies and fleas you cannot free, Whilst such sweet meates, good fires, soft beds there be: Yet guard your eyes and eares well, for we know, Princes both heare and see by such as you. The Flie and Flea hauing in Court got place, Saw all such Courtiers as were chiefe in grace. Still present with the King: how in his eare For being busie, some rewarded were: Others they saw get wealth with standing nie: But none did thriue that were not in his Eye. They thought since these alone grew rich and braue, They would as nimbly too themselues behaue. That they were black could be no hindrance thought, For many blacke gownes their preferment sought. But their ambition reacht t'ingrosse all grace, And shoulder others from so wisht a place, And thus resolu'd, the Flea leapes vp aloft, And in the Kings eare falls with footing soft. The foolish Flie did mount with speedy wing Betwixt the Eye-lids of th'amazed King; Who with his nimble hand did apprehend The rusticke Courtiers, and their hopes soon end. Quoth he, Ye saucy Traytors, Dare ye thus Presume our presence neuer cald by vs? Or being come, Is there no other place In all our Court to please you, but our face? And in our face no roome can you espie, But our reserued eare? our tender eye? In all my kingdomes you might freely range, And varied pleasures euery minute change Without my perturbation: only heere Your boldnesse you shall both with life buy deere. And though the Eagle takes no Fleaes nor Flyes Yet for presumption both by th' Eagle dyes. SOLARJUM. Dedicated. To the absolute and open enemies of Jgnorance and Darknesse, and the true Louers and Followers of Light and Knowledge, S?. Iohn Crosts and his happy LADY. The Clock that chim'de your praise, went right for still The Diall rulde his tongue the Sunne his Will. And as these led him right, you follow may, To heauenly glory, through the Milk-white-way. In some part of the World, I know not where, But sure S? Thomas Mardeuile was there. Betwixt a Clocke and a Sunne-dyall fell A difference which I with sorrow tell. With sorrow, for this error calls to minde Th'vncertainty, which we in Story finde; Where computations crosse, and make vs doubt Of what we all seeke, cannot one finde out. How to agree, and reconcile th'obscure, The fabulous, and certaine Age of our. The Age obscure; is that before the Floud: The Fabulous, on fained Wonders stood The race of gods, on golden Legends told, Where for sad truths, mad fictions were enrold. This latter Age more plaine and cleere, we call The certaine Age, or th' Age Historicall. Yet houres, and dayes, and yeeres haue sure been lost In some of these, which our accounts haue crost. And so they easily might, when from the Sunne To lying Clocks for our accounts we runne. This tale makes all apparant, or at least, Makes probable, what some haue thought a ieast. Within a Churchyard once a Dyall stood Vpon a square hewne Marble, which the Flood In vaine with enuious waues had often sought To spoile, when it the whole world vnder brought. But Seth's wise sonnes had fastned it so sure, It could all stormes, and stresse of times endure. And thereon they had caru'd the Art, and lore They learned of their Grandsire long before. Vpon a Church or steeples side neere hand A goodly Clocke of curious worke did stand; Which ouer paysde with lead or out of frame, Did time miscall, and euery houre misname. The Dyall hearing this, aloud gan cry Kinde neighbour Clocke your glib tongue tells a lye. Reforme your error, for my Gnomon saith You gad too fast, and misse an houres faith. Foole (quoth the Clocke) reforme thy selfe by me, The fault may rather in thy Gnomon be. Had'st thou tould euer truth, to what end then Was I plac'de here, by th'art of cunning Men? The weather-Cocke vpon the steeple standing And with his sharpe eye all about commanding, Heard their contention, wil'd them to appeale To him the Chiefe of all that Common-weale. Told them that he was set to Ouersee And to appease, to guide and to agree All diff'rence in that place; and whatso'ere He setteth downe from Iustice cannot erre. For from the winde he information takes Which searcheth through the world, &amp; swiftly makes A true suruay of euery proofe and cause, And doth of Reason know the ground, and lawes. He bids them boldly speake, and bring their pleas, And hee'le define th'infallible truth with ease. The Dial then beginnes. The globe-like world From Center to Circumf'rence being whorl'd In neuer-resting motion, maketh time In sundry reuolutions fall and clime. This Time the measure of all mutable things Comes with lead-heeles, flies hence with fiery wings; Sleepes with two eyes, hath two eyes euer waking, Twixt minuts, hours, daies, nights, distinction making And though the diff'rence and degrees of change, In seuerall yeares, be wonderfull and strange; Some by the Moone, some reckoning by the Sunne, And some the great yeare, wh? th'heauens hauing run Their compleat course, doe to that point arriue Whence the first mouer, them did motion giue; Yet the most generall certaine count of all Is measur'd by the Sunne, whose rise and fall Makes day, and night, and noone, and midnight too, Spring, Summer, Winter, Autumne, and the two Solsticiums, Equinoctials, and the houres Now naked, and then deck't in gaudy flowers. This Adam to his Grandsons hauing told, With other Arts, and wonders manifold, How all the world both fire and flood should try; They plac'd me here, to tell posterity Such hidden mysteries; And to direct The wiser Soules deep-diuing intellect. About me they haue grau'd seauen liberall Arts, The Sciences, with their diuiner parts, A circle and a Gnomon set aboue With Characters; which as the Sunne doth moue In his ascent, or low declension, tells The certaine houre, degree, and all things else. But for my speech was slow, and cause the Sunne Did often vnder clouds for pleasure runne, Succeeding ages did this Clocke out finde T'attend on me, and to declare my minde, From me intelligence and rules ro gather To measure night, close stormes, and cloudy weather: And in the Morne, finding his reckoning wrong, By my straight rule, to tune and set his song. But this forgetfull Clocke at randome strikes, Not as I bid, but fondly what it likes: Robs short-liu'de Man of his most precious time, And orderlesse, doth others orders chime. It will not follow me, but wanting wit, VVould haue the Sunne and Me to waite on it. This matter so apparant, though I might Wild Weather-Cocke, except against your right To iudge, and thinke you partiall at the least, Since you o're-cloude me when the Sun comes West, And will take part with it, that's in the name, In nature, and in sight, almost the same With you; yet know I'le not refuse Thy censure, but high place with honour vse. Thus did the Dyal end, and then the Clocke Low-louting to the powder Weather-Cocke, Began his plea. Thou mighty Soueraigne VVhich doest the vniuersall Iudge remaine In all those places, where thy pearcing eye Can see, or my shrill voice be heard to cry. Behold this impudent, poore, neglected post How it gainst me, and gainst thy stare doth bost Embasing thy great worth, neglecting mine; As if the glorious Sunne did neuer shine, Nor his sweet influence on vs let fall, But that the Dial had ingrost vp all. VVhen all the world knowes thou wer't placed there The sleepy Hinde vp to his worke to reare, To call the Scholler to his booke, and wake The Theefe which at thy shrill voice gins to shake. Thou art the cheerefull dayes Embassador, In whose praise once these lines composed were. A crowned King, a compleat Knight, An armed Captaine, fit to fight, A plumed Courtier, fairely clad, A louer that was neuer sad, A Trumpetter, the house-wifes Mate, Who riseth early sleepeth late, A Querister, the poore mans Clocke, All this is our great Weather-Cocke. This sacred Antheme all the world doth sing To thee the Suns bird, who doth tidings bring, Of his approch and rising: as for me I heere was seated, next thee in degree To giue thee ease, to tell the wondring people What thou discouer'st from that loftie steeple, The whil'st thou keep'st thy voice from Iubiles, And art for silence honour'd with large fees. The Dial is my ward, first placed there That Common Persons who presume not neere Thy hallow'd throne, may haue intelligence And learne from me the close and hidden sence Of all those Characters, and not expound As lift themselues, darke riddles, so profound: Nor contradict, nor yet correct by force, According to the Gnomon, my true course; But the false Gnomon rather to correct By my aduice, whose way is still direct. Who knowes not, that the Sun in his round race, Many degrees is gone from his first place, And like a drunkard reeling to and fro, With giddy steps doth shift his circle so; That where he was euen now, he comes no more, His course is all confusde, behin'ds before? Needs must the Dial then deceiued be, Which trusts a Guide that doth so disagree Within it selfe, and without iudgement shines Alike on all, making of fooles Diuines. And teaching Fishermen to see as farre, As learned Shepheards, without other starre. Too common in this Guide, to guide aright; Or if he could, where is the Guide for night? I then am present still at euery neede Poore erring man, in ignorant night to leade. Then why should this bold Dial, dare to speake Against my greatnesse, or the orders breake Of custome and consent? since all make choice To feede, fast, pray, or play, led by my voice? And that all bargaines made, all wagers laide, Not by the Dial but the Clocke are paide? Which truth, whilst all the world dare neuer doubt, This Dial seemes to question, and (growne stout) Excepts against thy iudgement too, that thus He might be free and seeme to gouerne vs. But since our causes are so neere of kinne, Let that respect some grace and fauour winne With thy high holinesse, that thou maist see To giue iust sentence for your selfe and me. The weather-Cocke thrice turn'd himselfe about, As taking care to minde the matter out; And thrice return'd, as if he were as free From preiudice, as from integritie. Then thrice hee claps his wings (which courage showes) And thrice aloude his senslesse sentence crowes. To giue a reason, wherefore, how, and what, When, where, by whom, or fondly this or that, Might argue reference to higher power; But what is he whose place doth equall our? We are the rule of reason, truths cleare law. Heare then with reuerence, and obey with awe. Without more question, argument, or triall, The iudgement I pronounce against the Dial. The Dial shall be guided by the Clock. This is the sentence of the weather-Cock. Which when the Clock had heard (puft vp with pride) He ginnes the wronged Dial to deride; And sits his tongue at large, too much, too soone; Twelu times he fetch'd his breath, &amp; laugh'd out none. The Dial then with indignation moued By this inuectiue speech their fault reproued. Poore silly Clock (quoth he) reioyce thy fill, Time will reforme thy ignorant zeale with skill, Stay thy distempered course, which hurried now, By mad-braind humor, goes it knowes not how. Time that's my pupill, shall thy Tutor be, And teach a diff'rence twixt thy selfe and me; Then thou wilt know thy error, and recant That euer thou wert proud of so much want. But as for thee (thou iudge corrupt and base, Who bindst all knowledge Prentise to thy place) Know this, th'all-seeing Sunne thy folly knowes, And to each vulgar eye thy shaddow showes, That they may plainly see how poore thou art Thy head deform'd, defectiue euery part. And that those high prerogatiues of state You challenge proper to your selfe, are late Vpstart intrusions, vsurpations new; Forg'd by the force or flattery of some few. The promise which you boast, to haue the winde Blow where you list, and alter when you minde, Is false, and foolish; but 'twas promisde still To blow and guide you right, if that you will. And so it doth, so it doth others too, If they consent, not whether they will or no. For when they would the point and quarter know Where it doth breath, on me they looke; I show The truth to them and thee, if you looke right, If not, you are misled by your owne sight. But how can'st thou others from error keepe When as thy selfe foulded in error deepe, Shun'st reformation, and wilt neither minde, My graue directions, nor the powerfull wind? I can remember, long before thou Wert When wise Alcedo stood where as thou art. He calm'd all stormes, and pacified the wind To patient sufferance, bent his humble minde. He to the fisher, and the Seaman gaue Directions, how their storme-tost barke to saue. When by the Lee-shore, when to lanch the Maine, And when to lie at Hull, when to remaine In harbour Anchor-fast, and when to saile With a full winde, and when againe to vaile: How, where and when, to cast their nets, and lay Their hidden hookes, where all the skull do play. Some of each kinde, yet at each corner stand, Who still loue truth; in spite of thy command: Their heads look south, because the wind blows there, Thy taile stands south, thy head the winde doth feare. Ill might he fare that in Alcedos place, Set thee, who springest from a bloudy race. His error, and thy pedigree behold As it in ancient story is inrould. A trayt'rous Slaue, his Master hauing slaine Did sole Commander of the world remaine. But whilst he slept; a chickin of that Cocke Which Cephas check't when he denyde the rocke, And forc't him to repent, to sigh, and weep, Did with his voyce the murtherer wake from sleep, And would not suffer him to rest in sin, But he would rouse his conscience still within. This Murtherer, a Cocke of kinde did get, And him to kill this kinder Cocke did set, Who soone perform'd the taske he tooke in hand: For Chauntecleer would suffer, not withstand. He watchfull was and tended his vocation, To stirre vp others to their occupation: He lou'd the pearle more then the barley corne; To crow, and not to quarrell he was borne. So he was slaine, and slaine by one of those From whence thy proud succession strangely rose Who hight Alectrion, and while-ere had bin The Pandor vnto Mars and Venus sin, And then (being Captaine of great Mars his guard), Stood Sentinel, and kept both watch and ward, For feare that Phœbus all discouering eye, Should them vnwares at their stolne pleasure spie. But ouert'ane with sleep, he did not wake Till Vulcans net did both the lechers take; For which the angry God (inrag'd and mad) His sleeping souldier, all in feathers clad, His sword turn'd spurres, himselfe a Cocke of kinde, His armes and body changde, but not his minde; That's bloody still, and too far prone to fight Without respect of persons, cause, or right. Else would he ne're haue been so mad to kill, A harmeles Cocke, who had no thought of ill. But him he falsely slew, and hauing slaine Did for this murther, of a murtherer gaine Too great preferment, to be set vp heere In triumph t'ouersee all, farre and neere; To be ador'de with vniuersall praise And triple crownd with Oliue, Oake, and Bayes. Him thou succeed'st both in thy minde and place, An armed Champion, of that yron race, A Souldier, none of his whose badge thou bear'st; But rather one of his whose crowne thou wear'st; Thy narrow heeles are sharpe, thy tongue is short: To prey, and not to prayer fit t'exhort. Thou wilt not crow to rouse the world from sleep, But with thy silent charmes, it drunken keepe. When thou most seruant-like thy head dost beare Downe to the ground, then Cockes their crownes may feare. Thou seek'st a fained quarrell then to pick, And wilt with both wings mount, with both heeles strick, At euery feather come, stab either spur Vp to the hilts; and furiously bestur Thy ready parts, t'attaine thy bloody end, And all the world to thy owne scope to bend. Thou trumpet'st warres and curses ouer all, And ouer-crowes, but wilt not crow to call Thy selfe and others of thy ranke, and place, From looking on the Earth, to view the face Of the all-searching Sunne, and by his light To measure truly what is wrong and right. The Cock is kil'd that Peter caus'de to weepe, The Petrean Pastor now may safely sleep. Sleepe though he hath deni'd his master too; For none t'admonish him hath ought to doo. Crauen awake, behold how I deride Thy mutabilitie, thy sloth, thy pride, Thou stand'st where he stood who claim'd all the world, And shalt with him from that steep height be hurld. About thy head each prating bird that perks, Dare take the name and place of learned Clerks, And vnto royall Eagles offer lawes, VVhen each eye sees, they are but iangling dawes. And though all Lyons in the desart feare, And crouch, when they thy crowing voice do heare: Our Lyon scornes thee, when he heares thee crow; And with his roaring voice the world doth show, How poore thou art, how cowardly, how weake, Who shak'st &amp; tr?blest when thou hear'st him speak. And yet how proud art thou, t'vsurpe a place Of iudgement ouer me, in this darke case, And to prefer the Clock for want of wit, VVhen I should be the iudge of thee and it? The Sexton comes, hee'le mend all this anone. VVith that the angry Clocke in rage strooke one. The Sexton came indeed, and one did tell, Look't on the Diall, saw all was not well. For that said twelue, the Clock said one and past. He tooke the weights off, which caus'd too much hast, Suruaide the wheeles, for there the fault might be, And found some cog supply the place of three. Some wheeles were taken off, and borne to Court, To trundle vp and downe, and there make sport. And some with dust, and rust, were duld and foild, And some stood vselesse, so the Clocke was spoild. Which to reforme, he mends the wheels forthwith Files, oyles, and beats them throughly on a stith: Makes weights and wyere fit, then by the Sunne Sets the new course, which it doth truly runne. Then going vp the steeples top he spies The weather-cocke how palpably it lies. For at each Corner the Kings-fishers stood, Full South; and that the Dial prooued good. But the fond Weather-cocke (being weather-wise) From the Calme blast turn'd his scornefull eyes. The Sexton tooke him downe, and straight did see An easie way how he might mended be, His head was too too great, with 3. combes crownde Which euer when the wind blew turn'd him round. His taile was too too weake, when euery feather Was bent with storms, and broken with the weather The Sexton cut his crownes, and gaue more saile With them and with the spurs vnto his tayle So humbled now in habite, looke and minde, He waites with due obedience on the winde: Knowes his high place was not to rule, but serue, And means no more from this strict course to swerue. This tale no mortall needs, it is not darke, But points a worke fit for our learned Clarke Who by the Dyal may reforme the Clocke, And by kings fishers turne the Weather-cocke. We haue the winde to helpe vs and the Sunne, And works are halfe accomplisht when begun. Then who'le begin? who is on our side, who? Where words, winde, writings faile, resolue to Doe.</field>

Then noble Britaine do not scorne to see Thy owne face in this Glasse I proffer thee: Two of thy children, whose fortune tels, What danger and assur'd destruction dwels In thy dis-vnion; and how fond they are, Who with false reasons nurse thy ciuill warre. The two (two Worthies, nobly borne and bred; Inrich'd with vertue, and vpon the head Of Court and Kingdome plac'd, (as Iewels worne For vse and ornament) now rent and torne, Remaine sad spectacles; and cry aloud O Man, why, being mortall, art thou proud? Why art thou proud of beauty? Roses blast; Or of thy wealth? the mines of India waste; Or of thy strength? since sicknes, age, or wounds Let loose the stiff-strung ioynts, and spirit confounds. Or of thy honour, and thy high-borne blood? Since to be great is not worth praise, but good: Or of all these? since all these, and much more Wharton and Steward had, lost, and di'd poore. Much more they had; so much, that hard it is To tell what either wanted. Earths chiefe blisse, (Their Princes fauour) like the Sunne aboue In his hot Solstice stood, and did improue Their blooming youth's with ripened fruit, before Their thoughts could hope: ô what could they wish more? Friends sought th?, fortune blest th?; blest them so, That which might happiest seeme was hard to know, Neither had cause of Enuie; except thus, As th'eies, hands, feet, which guide, guard, carry vs; Whose selfe like shape, and equall vse admits No warre, but fellow-feeling of such fits, Griefes, and diseases, and each part sustaines; So shar'd they in all pleasures, toyles, sports, paines. Nor had these other cause of warre at all, “And causelesse warre is most vnnaturall. Yet (oh) that subtle Spirit incens'd rash blood With franticke rage, that euery ill seem'd good. They first must pray; so vndeserued gold “Ill got, we waste, and haue no power to hold. Then they proceed to words, from words to blowes; “The way to ill is easie; but who knowes The Clue that we returne by? hence proceeds A Challenge from wrong'd Wharton: Steward needs No such stale prouocation: Mischiefes feet “Are swift to blood: their quicke desires soon meet, And (met) soone fight; bold Steward falls by Fate; Wharton by Chance: those powers each other hate. So I haue seene from th'Indies East and West, Two Ships well rigg'd and mann'd vpon the brest Of Thetis dancing, spreading flags abroad For ioy of their long-wisht-for English roade; Past now all dangerous Rocks, Gulphs, Pyrats, Sand, Ready t'vnlade their rich fraught on firme land, And tell the story of their perils past, And frolicke with glad friends in peace, at last. When spying each other so bedeckt, adorn'd, With outward pomp: ones pride the other scorn'd, And from that enuious scorn some word proceeding, And from that word some blow, from that blow bleeding. Then giuing way to fury, all inrag'd, Both are in desp'rate tearmes of fight ingag'd. The fire in water, Lead in th'ayre, their center Doe madly seeke; and both these rudely enter The strong ships wombe, and ransacke euery hold, For pretious life, neglecting Indian gold. The shot seems thunder, but the dying grones Of slaughtered soules, shrike louder, deeper tones Then roring Cannons, whose thicke charging rout Lets water freely in, and poures bloud out. In this hot fight both firmly doe defend, Both nimbly do assault, both madly spend, Strength, skill, and all to hurt. Conquest inclines To neither part as partiall. Equall lines Are drawne betwixt them both by Fate and Chance; Till th'one his topsaile fairely doth aduance To win the winde, and in that vantage flies With force and fury on his foe; who plies All meanes to salue this losse, and to regaine Faire ods, or equall standing once againe. But all in vaine, fortune, the winde, and sea, Confederate with the aduerse seeme to be. So this to sinke (rather then yeeld) resolues, And halfe his tatter'd sides the Sea inuolues. When th'other (couetous) grapples with his foe, To bourd and rob him: and (being chained so) The ship that leaks sinks, and with his weight drawes The Conqueror with Conquest, to deaths iawes. So fares it with these noble Combatants Both equally of blood and honor vaunts: Both enui'd and belou'd alike, both friends, Both yong, both valiant, and their life and ends So paralell, and twin-like like in all That they obtain'd one graue, one funerall. One graue, one funerall, they obtain'd, yet lost The fame and honor their youth thirsted most. Because their quarrell on false grounds begun, Could not produce true praise, nor true blame shun. The wounds thou gau'st stout Wharton had bin good Against thy Kings or faiths foe; and thy blood Heroicke Steward, had been nobly shed, Against such slaues; so both had brauely bled. And your brasse Monuments had spoke the fame Of Whartons noble, Stewards royall name. Then the fierce challenger for his quicke charge, And stout assault with wounds giuen deepe and large; His apt command of euery part soone shunning, All wounds saue one, giuen more by chance then cunning And the Defendant, who so long time stood Drownd (yet vndanted) in his owne life blood; And deadly wounded, past all hope of liuing, Death in his death to his haile fooeman giuing; Had filld the largest leaues of Fames faire story, And both worne wreath of triumph, conquest, glory: And then like patterns to both Realms, set out By vertue for example; the wise and stout Had been your schollers, and their lessons read, In those greene fields, where both so boldly bled. But now (aye me!) as rocks, bars, sands, at sea, Or marks set vp to shew ships where they bee, Or rather as some wrack'd ships selfe, whose mast Ore-looks the waues, and yet still sticking fast In th'eating silt, bids the wise Pilot flye The tracklesse path, where such hid dangers lye. So stand these two, the signes of woe, and ruth, Of shipwrackt honor, fortune, valour, youth; And by their deaths confirme this speech for good, “Vertue hath greater priuiledge then blood. “Our soules are Gods, our bodies are the Kings, “And he that in his priuate quarrell brings “Either of these in question doth betray “The Kings part, and giues Gods part cleane away. England, behold in Wharton what thou art, And Scotland see in Steward euery part Of thy best power; shun enmitie and strife, None but your selues haue power of eithers life. Let no slight toyes (the snares and traines of hell) Breed war betwixt you two; but kindly dwell Within this Ile as in one house, the rather Being thereto wooed by your good King, kind father. If not, peruse this glasse, and let not me The fatall Prophet of such ill newes be To your succeeding times; but choose you whether You'le still liue friends, or like these die together. DUELLI FINIS A cast of Falcons (in their pride At passage scouring) fowle espide Securely feeding from the spring, At one both ayme with nimble wing. They first mount vp aboue Mans sight, Plying for life this emulous flight In equall compasse, and maintaine Their pitch without a lazie plaine. Then stooping freely (lightning like) They (counter) dead each other strike. The fowle escapes, and with her wings Their funerall dirge, this lesson sings. “Who aimes at glory not aright, “Meetes death, but Glorie takes her flight. Epitaphium Georgii Whartoni Milit.

IVSTITIA IACOBI. Dedicated to the graue, reuerend, and iudicious Knight, S?. Robert Gardiner, sometime Lord Iustice of Ireland. So many men presse now for place in State, Deseart and Worth cannot come neere the gate: But happy were it for the State and Vs, If we (as Rome did) sought for Curius. There should we finde him, farre from Court, with you Perhaps a Gardiner, or perhaps at Plow. Yet euen the same which Pyrrhus did withstand, Samnites, and Sabines ruld, as you Ireland. Then should our Kings cleare Iustice shine too bright To suffer potent wrong, cloude impotent right. Then should this act of Iustice so aboue All presidents, make others like it mooue. But wretched we, whilst few the doore can passe Of high preferment, but the Laden Asse. DEUS VIDET. Man, Angell, nor the Fiend of Hell, Can Mans heart see, search, and tell, That God alone doth vnderstand, Closing all thoughts within his hand, He better knowes then Priest, Iudge, Scribe, Who gaue the last cause-carrying bribe. He sees, when sentence goes awry, Where the hidden ground doth lie. He knowes if it be true or no, The doubtfull witnesse sweares vnto. He markes the Iewrie and their leader, And obserues the lying Pleader. He notes the Councell what they doe, And the Kings heart searcheth too. [How hatefull is this silence? I haue stood] How hatefull is this silence? I haue stood Wishing, expecting, musing long, who wou'd With honest thrift, this faire aduantage take To fame himselfe for euer, and to make This sencelesse age conceiue (perhaps commend) The good we now enioy, not apprehend. Time was, Kings words were like to apples, snatch'd From t'Hesperides, so obseru'de, so watch'de. None suffer'd to drop downe; all highly prizde Preserued, recorded, apothegmatizde. But now their words (though Oracles to those Of former times, though verse vnto their prose) Are slighted by this lip-wise age of ours; Whose rootles knowledge bears no fruits but flow'rs. Where is the Man whose better fate, admits Him place, time, meanes, to heare the King of wits. Discourse like Salomon, of euery thing, Begot betwixt the winter and the spring? Determine euery doubt that doth arise Twixt heauen and earth, the idiot and the wise? That doth for priuate vse, or publike good Make knowne how Saba-like, he vnderstood? And did not (like the pictures) waite for show To fill place only, but to learne to know. This man is yet no Courtier, or at least No daily waiter; scarce seene at a feast. Too poore and plaine to trauaile, and bring backe The tongue and heart of treason; he doth lacke A face t'outface his wants, and doth bewray His ignorance in euery arrogant way. He meanes good faith and speakes it, though the lip Of censuring law, his state and body stript Of coyne, and eares, and freedome; it's no crime, To speake truth (he thinks) though't be out of time. He is no chamber Traytor from hell sent, To vndermine the Soules high Parliament. He cannot candy poyson; wants the waies To tickle truth to death, with her owne praise. He dares not weare a desperate suite t'vndoe Himselfe, a Mercer, and a Taylor too: And then make that the preface how to aske Towards his vnknowne losse in the last maske. But such as can those Court-lie Mysteries Want time for this. Themselues are histories Not easely learn'd; t'will aske a perfect Man To read them daily o're, do what he can. And ere he learns by heart each attribute Appropriate to the body, and the suite, Himselfe growes old, or a new-fashion springs: Which shifts the Scene, the forme, and face of things. Thus silk-worms spend their times, &amp; schollers too Haue idle worke enough to turne them to. Perhaps a paire of feete and a tongue stroue Who should walke fastest, and most countries roue. In fewest howers to smallest purpose; these At length returne (their trauailes finisht) please To publish their fond Iournall. But (alasse!) Neither themselues, nor their huge worke can passe Our presse vnpraisde. O Courtiers thither hie, Gallants, Wits, Poets; Let your Muses flie Not to reforme, or settle this light braine, But render him more wilde.

Or if not this, some other witty taske Staies your continuall leisures, and doth aske Inke from your pens, t'asperge, deforme, defile, States and their instruments, with libells vile. No man must liue without your fawning praise, Nor no man die without your round delaies. Death maks you sport, &amp; stroks which force the State, Stagger and reele; your humors eleuate. “Vice liuing, is preferd to Vertue dead, “The present, no time els, is honored. If you attend on Kings, it's to obserue Their imperfections, where their frailties swerue In rash attempts or passionate words vnstaid, From iuster rules, their intemperate bloods once laide As if Kings were not men, weake, fraile, and poore, Like to their Subiects, and subiected more. As if at Rome (whether you send this newes) All there were Saints, &amp; your Popes Court no stewes. As if that you a Patent had from Hell All things to say or doe, but nothing well. O! if you yet retaine a graine of that, Which your high aimes would seeme to leuell at: Or if no faith (but that you Atheists be, And nothing but vnhallow'd Reason see) If but a sparke of that remaine intire, Which you seeme to monopolize (the fire Prometheus filch'd from Ioue) let that bright flame Kindle your zeales for selfe, kings, countries fame, To vse those opportunities, parts, places, Intelligences, meanes, friends, fortunes, graces, You haue 'boue other, for the publique good, That we may vnderstand you vnderstood.

I sing thy Iustice, whose cleere raies giues light, To neighbour Princes in this ignorant night Of mistie error, and corrupt Respect, How to informe aright their intellect. And (hauing here on earth, mongst Christian Kings And Pagans shone) it mounts the winds swift wings Calming the sea, bounding her ebs and tides, And in her monthly change the moist Moone guides. Then sores vp higher, and informes the Sunne, How mongst the signes in an euen line to run; How to make daies, and nights; and higher yet Mounts, till it be in the first Mouer set. Two warlike kingdomes linck't in happy peace. When they beheld how common fewdes did cease And saw how strongly blest that concord stands, Where brethren ioyne first hearts, and after hands, Resolu'd that course; turn'd matches into Maskes, And reuelling tissues wore for massier Caskes: Steeds traind for ready fight, learnd now to peace, And knew no foes but Buckes and Hares; nor race But on smooth plaines for wagers, or for sport, Not for lou'd life; where Campes lay, lay the Court. Keene swords that bit the bone, abated now Kist without making skars, or help'd the plow To draw long furrowes on the fruitfull earth, Least Peace should (breeding teeth too fast) breed dearth. Blunt foiles were on sharpe pointed Rapiers set, And so Lord Sanquier and poore Turner met. They met to play: there Sanquier lost an eie. O Brittaine! canst thou nothing further spie, In this then his losse? Looke vp now and see; Securitie hath ta'ne an eye from thee. Ill didst thou ward that blow; If sport hurt so, O what will open force and malice do? Thy King rides, hunts and falls. Are horses then Turn'd traitors too? will beasts proue like to men? Can Kings finde sportfull peace so hazardous? To armes then Cæsar, shun the Senate house. Like poison, ponyards, pistols, Death aboue Attends on Princes when they feed, sleep, moue; Beneath like powder, that the ground they tread, Seemes all one continent, to quicke and dead. And is't not so with others too? behold, This silly Fencer, in his ignorance bold Think's his submissiue sorrow will suffice For that vnhappy thrust at Sanquiers eyes; And begging pardon, seemes to haue it then. What foole dares trust the vnseald words of men? Yet Turner will. A reconciled foe “Seemes a true friend, to him would haue him so. He thinks (now Dunne is dead) to die in peace. “but blood cries out for blood, and doth not cease “Till vengeance followes. Vengeance euen at hand Whaits like a treacherous Groome of Sanquiers; and (When Turner nothing of his neere death thinkes, But laughes,, &amp; plaies, &amp; to his deaths-man drinkes.) Let's his charg'd pistoll flie, whose mouth spits lead With fire-wing'd speede, striking the Fencer dead. “No ward auoides that blow: Pale Death we see “A fellow-gamester in all sports will be. The Murtherers flee; Iustice pursues with speede, Th' Abettor, Actor, Author of this deede; Who (apprehended) apprehend too late (If friends helpe not), the issue of their fate. But friends will help. One steps vnto the King, Kneeles and thus pleads. Leige Lord, you are the spring, From whence Nobilitie flowes. And all our blood The neerer yours it comes, the neerer good: As you first gaue, so let your power preserue Those that are set a part the Crowne to serue; Others by fit election, these by fate Are made hereditarie to the State; Distinguish'd from the common ranke of those Who only know they are not, when they rose. And priuiled'ge aboue the raskall rout, Whose words and deeds haue reference to account. Else why did our bold fathers, with the losse, Of lymmes and liues, honors for vs ingrosse? O why do these new Nobles dearely buy Those attributes for which they dare not die? Or why should land or gold, which all things can Be giuen for titles, if they mend not man, And something adde besides an emptie sound, To recompence the glosse of gold and ground? If honour doth nought but a name afford, A Lordship then is better then a Lord. “Nobilitie this priuiledge doth bring, “It makes the owner something like a king; “Exempting him from penall lawes, which crack “With heauy pressure the poore Commons back. This (Sir) I speake t' excite your royall power To rescue Noble Sanquir, who this houre Is by the too-strick't vnrespectiue lawes Condemn'd to die a villaines death. The cause And quarrell this. The Barron chanc'd to play With a rude Fencer; where both did bewray Their best ability at Rapier foyles. The Pencer to vphold his credit toyles, But wanteth skill; which makes his hate arise; And with an enuious thrust at Sanquirs eyes, The wicked and inchanted foyle depriues An eye of sight; worth many Fencers liues. The suffering Lord forbeares to kill him then But being after scorn'de by watermen, Fidlers, and such base instruments of hell For this foule blemish, his great heart did swell. And (full of noble courage) loth to do So blacke a deede himselfe, he puts it to His mans performance, who obaide too soone, Repentance came before the deede was done. The equall lawes to equalls doth appoint An eye should haue an eye, ioynt answere ioynt. But where such oddes of persons be, I ghesse An eye should haue a life to boote, no lesse. Yet not on this or that doth Sanquir stand; His death, his life, his doome is in your hand. He doth confesse the foulnesse of his guilt: He sorrowes for the blood that he hath spilt. Your mercy (royall Sir) he doth implore For this rash act, who neuer beg'd before. Scarce had he done, and e're the king could speake, An other thus begins. If you should wreake Each English peasants life with bloud so hie As noble Sanquir is, No memorie Of your faire traine, of Natiue Scots, should stand, To let times know the glory of that land. Souldiers must doffe their armes, and gowns put on, If villaines so foule may passe vpon Lords vnreueng'de; or if those antique names, Those honors, trophees, and eternall fames, We got by killing many Englishmen, Be for the death of one, thus lost agen. If thus to quench the fewde you pleased are, You thereby quench the heart of lawfull warre. Remember what a souldier he hath bin; How easly might forget it was a sinne. And thinke he did but chastice one of those Who 'gainst his Leader muteni'de, and rose. Many of th' English haue been pardoned For treasons capitall. Some honored For their knee-seruice, and no other merit. Then (Sir) let vs who lineally inherit Allegeance, worth, and honours; sometime finde You left not all your Scottish blood behinde: Nor meane to leaue vs in the hands of those Who kill with law more friends, then fewdes kil foes. Thus ended he; And then as in a Queere Of solemne singers, one shall euer heare After the Trebles hath the Antheme sung, (And their diuisions with shrill vtterance rung); The Base, the Tenor, Counter-tenor sweet, With Howboyes, Cornets, Trumpets, Organs meet, And ioyne their hye-stretcht notes, that all the ring Seemes Eccho-like, their sonnets to resing: So did the graue and gallant troope, which stood About the King (like a dew-dropping wood) Conuey their powres to make this consort full And cryed; Be stil'd King Iames the mercifull. Or (if to satisfie the course of law, And stop Opinions wide-gull swallowing iaw) Life must haue life, take Carlisle, one for one, And one to boote too; so this Lord be none. With that (as if all aymes would this aduance) Comes from the Regent and the King of France, Letters, intreating for their Pensioners life; And last, as if the difference of a wife Should from this fact take characters, to know A true good wife, from a good wife in show: Comes his forsaken Lady all in blacke, (Whose youth from him did due beneuolence lacke) Weeping, intreating, for her lost Lords sinne, And then like fullomes that run euer in A baile of Gossips (some true beggars borne, Pittying this Lord more then the Lord of Lorne) Beg his remission with obstreperous voice: But mongst the rest, she that made lowdest noise, Was Turners Widdow, whose shrill throat did yell, That she was satisfied, and all was well. The king abhord it, and his vpright heart, Beholding these assaults on euery part, Made it his glory to be onely good, And from his crowne to wipe those staines of blood. Thus he replies: “The crowne for Iustice sake, “Heau'n plac'd vpon our head; which none can shake “Or touch, till with vniustice we make way, “And (for respect) that strict rule disobay. “God is our Guard of proofe, that we may be “A guard to you vnpartiall, iust, and free. “And this stands firme; If one hand goes about “To signe a croock't line, th'other blurs it out. O magnanimitie, aboue a Man! O Iustice more confirm'd then that which wan Zeleuchus so much fame! Corrupt with gold States, Courtiers, Law, or Wiues that will be sold. Peruert with passion euery solid heart, Moue Stoickes, or melt marble with thy Art, Iustice sits still vntouch'd, with kingly care, Not pardoning till true mercy bids him spare. And then not striking, though the life he giues, Repines, and enuies that the giuer liues. Deni'de they vanish, as the cloudes disperse, When the hot-shining Sunne lookes red and fierce. The law proceeds; the Actors suffer first, A death too-good, too-bad; the best the worst. The Author then submits him to his doome, And dies a Catholike; That's a man of Rome. O Rome! Liues yet that Wolfe which was thy Nurse When (growing great) thou grewst the whole worlds curse? May none yet leap thy wals, or leaue thy Sea Vnslayne, though he a King and brother be? Retain'st thou yet that sauage kinde, to pray On the distressed flocke which shuns thy way? Do all that sucke thy brests, for milke sucke blood? Dare not that spring from thee die well, doe good? Must Gibbets onely rocke them to their rest? Doe they desire that death? become they't best? Must Traytors, Murtherers, only be thy Saints? Weare none white robes but such as scarlet paints? Else why doe all euill men so soone drinke vp The deadly lees of thy inchaunted cup? Or why doe fooles so credit what Rome sayth, But for they easely learne implicit faith? If Rome keep heauens keyes, (as 'tis out of doubt), None dare barre Lambert, or Lord Sanquir out: Nor neede they feare, where Iesuits haue to doe, Garnet shall be a Saint, and Iudas too: Their writings and examples murther teach; They'l not condemne the doctrine which they preach. This makes our desperate Ruffins, Romanes dye. And our crack'd Virgins seeke a Nunnery. Iustice rise Lyon-like out of thy sleepe, The Westerne Wolues worry the Irish sheepe: And here at home thy borders swarme with those Who doe imitate, breed, beget thee foes. The scar thou thinkst to close, these make more wide, “True faith vnites, but their faith doth deuide. The Grimes are banish'd, but worse Foxes earth In those vast places, through the Gospels dearth. The Humour that feeds these, affects the heart, And doth dilate it selfe through euery part By secret influence, though it closely lurkes, “Causes are best discouered by their workes. “Examples though they doe no other ill, “Rebell against the Lawes in being still. “They count'nance giue to error, and curbe in “Bold reprehension, making truth a sinne. “Who hides his question'd faith he ought reueale, “Will vtter what perhaps he should conceale.

We know whens'ere they come, God can prouide Such seas, so high, so vncontrold a tide, Able without their Enuie, or their ayde To bury vs; for see how he hath layde Our workes all leuell; draines, dikes, sluces, bankes, Fields, pastures, gardens, mannors, farmes, and franks With man their owner, and what Man doth feed, Are buried with a sea of teares indeed. Nouember did we scape thy fift day thus, That euery day thou should'st be ominous? Doe we so soone forget the sixt day last, And worst of all daies to our Iland past, That thus we should so oft remembred be, From what strange thraldom, we were once set free? Or do the waters thus breake in, to show How humorous and irregular vices flow? How Saint-like Sacriledge doth impropriate? And calme Oppression swallowes Church and State? How close Hypocrisie bends his courtly knee, And (wanting all faith) would haue all faith's free? How holy Hymens sacreds band are broken, His torch extinquish'd, and his rites fore-spoken? How Gotish lusts needs all those waues to slake His scorching flames, hot as th'infernall lake? Or is't for all these crimes, and more vntold, The faithfull Sea, which wont our Ile to hold In his moist armes, from strange assaults secure, Hath chang'd his loue to this sad ouerture? And (for our sinnes) learnes vs to fast and pray, Bringing in fish, sweeping our flesh away? That land which (Goshen-like) did flow whil-ere, With all that Man desires or life holds deere, So that no spot in all this Iles large field, The sythe more hay, sickle more corne did yield: Where sweetnes was the sawce, and fatnes fed, Whil'st Dearth, and Famine from the confines fled: Where the stiffe-vdder'd Cow long'd twice a day, To meet the merry milke-maide on the way: And missing her by chance, wrot on the ground With milke-white letters where she would be found, Now prostrate lyes; the goodly beauty foil'd, The welth wash'd thence, the gards &amp; tr?ches spoil'd. O what assurance haue we then in clay Which (if not Lawyers) Seas thus eat away? Build farre from waters, that secures thy feare, Though lesse thy profit be, safe dwelling there. O no; what's that I see? a raging flame Mounts vp in yonder plaine, and none can tame His hot misgouern'd furie. Water heere Some cry, but no such element is neere. Like a mad-Dog that through the thronged streets Ranging with rage snatcheth at all he meets, And all that bitten are, as mad as he, Runne raging too, that few or none scape free: The cry is vp, and euery man stands arm'd, To do he knowes not what till he be harm'd; And then to saue himselfe neglects the rest, And madly mischiefe does when he meanes best. Or as a towne of strength, at dead of night, Surpriz'd (by sodaine stratagem or slight,) The people (with the allarum bell awak'd) Run out to see what newes amaz'd and nak'd; And meeting death abroad, for life run home, And finde their houses sack'd before they come. Then turning backe againe they know not whither, Flocke all on heaps and dye like freinds together: So far'de it there; the fire flew vp and downe Snatching at euery house within the towne. And whilst one thought his neighbors house to saue, He sees his owne doth instant succour craue. Here stands an Alehouse tosting, and the Hostis Swearing her false-scor'd de tally burn'd or lost is. The Tapster (wanting water) plies with ale The thirstie fire which drinks both new and stale, And by that oyly-liquor is not quenched But rather (Drunkard-like) inrag'd, incensed. The Host (instead of pailes) fils pots and sweares Hee'le vse no penny-pots that wants their eares. Wisheth his Iuggs were bigger, he would fill them, And (but in vaine) on the wilde fire doth spill them. Here stares an Ostler whil'st the flame makes ceasure, On his small bottles and his ostry measure, And here a Chamberlaine giues quicke attendance To saue his pretty faggots with a vengeance. Those pretty faggots which fire-hot being eat In a cold morning, scarce would make one sweat. Here runs a rauening Usurer dog-like tyred Betwixt his owne house and the mort-gagde fired. Here flames a barne of some ingrossing Farmer. And here the study burnes of some false Termer. Here stands a kennell, there a rack and manger For running horses, but both stay the danger. A Baude houles here, and here a neast of whores Burnde oft within, are now burnde out of dores. Heere's a Tobacco shop, and in the Celler Th' Indian Deuil, our band, witch, whore, man-queller, That spirit waster, and that Liuer heater, Of t'humor radicall that greedy eater, That breath corrupter, and quick-eye-sight spoyler, That wit confounder, and strong Memorie foyler, That pickpurse, theefe, time-cheater, connycatcher, That alehouse haunter, and fell mischiefe hatcher, That all compounded euill of euery Nation, Too bad (almost) for th'English imitation; Tobacco by the fire was there caroused With large pettounes, in pisse perfum'd and soused. Thus what full many thrifty yeeres erected, One prodigall flame hath wasted and deiected. And now (behold) the prouder Chimnies stand As heires left well, who wasted haue their land, Of whom the common people vse to say, It's pitty proper men should thus decay; Yet none releeues them, or build vp their state To such an eminent fortune as of late. Mongst these one Chimney stands, where passers by May reade this sentence with a running eye, Nothing is so close carried or concealde, Which shall not be in his due time reueal'd. Whether by chance or by diuine decree, (For so all humane actions ordr'ed bee) This obiect stands; that all may make good vse Of what they see, or quit them from excuse, Ile not determine. Let it bee my folly Rather than bee profane, to bee too holy. He that once drown'd the world, can if he please, Drowne part or the whole world againe with ease: But since his word is past, though we abound With that which caus'd the former world be drown'd Hee'le keep his promise, and the Sea restraine From ouerflowing sinfull flesh againe. Yet is it in his power the whole t'mmerse In variable woes; plagues to disperse In the most frequent streetes, most fragrant fields, That th'ayre may breath out death, w? helth now yields Or thin cheek'd Famine (though a stranger borne) Who now to know on Fridayes th'English scorn, Who of all forrainers is worst intreated, His fashion left, himselfe in prison seated, May be familiar with our countreymen (Like a post-Natus, or free Denizen) And that without an act, if God thinke good, Though all the Peeres and Commons it withstood. Fire, aire, earth, water, all are his: he can With or without these, saue or punish Man. No place is free from him, no thing is hid, He knowes what Faukes, Persie, and Catesbie did Vnder the ground; and what new plots doe come From hell, or from hels Councel-chamber (Rome). And this, (and all els) his blest hand reueales To his elect, and with deliuerance seales. Attend his pleasure then; first we shall see Rome burne, and all with Rome that lynked bee. Then the whole world; and that fire shall disclose Each truth, each falshood, and each cause of those. Till then, these waters doe but wash the slime Of Babel from this too indifferent time. These petty fires, kindle our loue and zeale, (Halfe-dead) to King, the Church, &amp; c?mon-weale, Affliction profits. Strike vs (Lord) in loue; Let thy milde hand each way our firme faith proue. But let not Babel triumph in our fall, Nor any that on Baal, or Dag in call. ANTIDOTVM Cecillianvm. DEDICATED To the Common-wealth. Desert hath no true follower after death But Enuy; others flatter with their breath. Jn vaine I sought particular Patrons; they When life left greatnesse, ran with life away. Blood, kindred, friends, forsooke him: so't was fit, We might haue doubted else his worth and wit. Their compasse was too narrow to yield shade To him that both their rootes and fortunes made: But gentle England, since he quiet gaue To thee by his cares, giue his corps a graue. And since his wisdome did renowne thy name, Be thou a Sanctuary to his fame. And since he gaue for thee his life and health, Giue him protection, thankefull Common-wealth. TO THE HONOVR of the illustrious Familie of the Cecills, deseruing of this Commmon-wealth, all the Romane wreaths of triumph: The memorable Pyramids of Egypt: And all other Trophes of Eternitie. As by one mouer, motion, doth commence, Euen from the Center, to circumference: So from one good Man, many may arise, Like-good, like-apt, like-faithfull, and like-wise, This now is verified; The Cecills are Statesmen in time of peace, Souldiers in warre. Epicedium. What needs, thy Monument be rais'd? What needs, the Muses sing thy worth? What needs, thy memory be prais'd? Or what needs Art, thy fame set forth? Let Art, time, gold, the Muse, and Men, Guild falshood, folly, ignorance: Let them conspire gainst thee; and then, The more they shall thy worth aduance. They worke, write, raile, or praise to please, “But Truth giues vertue, life, not these. THESAVRVS INTVS. Darius on a Graue-stone found This Epitaph: Who digs this ground Shall treasure finde. The greedy King Dig'd there, but found another thing. Within was written; Had'st not been A beastly-minded man, I ween The harmelesse bones of the deceast Had in their quiet tombes tane rest. Who rips the coffins of the dead, Finds fame and honour thence are fled With life, the Subiect of their Ire; Stench onely stayes to pay their hire. “Worth hath his Epicedium sung “By enuies shrill and slandrous tongue. [When this rich soule of thine (now sainted) kept] When this rich soule of thine (now sainted) kept Her State on earth, my humble Muse nere stept Out of that sweete content wherein shee dwelt, To sing thy worth, th'effects whereof we felt. But now since death hath freedome giuen to thee, To see thy scorne made others flatterie, And that each mouse on the dead Lyon leaps, And euery riming pen, forg'd matter heaps On thy bright frame, casting their owne base durt Vpon thy honour'd hearse, (minding more hurt To thee then Death or Hell can doe) I may And must be bold (or sinne) this truth to say. Each euidence thy foes bring, speakes thy praise: For what can more thy fame and glory raise, Then to be rail'd on by the worst of men, Such as like out-lawes liue, not in the ken Of Iustice, or communitie? Base slaues Whose crimes &amp; sins make their own nest their graus. T'was meet thy vertues eminent and hie Should not vn-enuied liue, vnslandred dye: For then we might haue fear'd thou had'st not been So absolute a man; now it is seen Euen by those many shadowes Enuy throwes, That thy worth was substantiall, and not showes. Detraction is perplext, and flies about Ouer a world of Acts to single out Some one or two in thy whole life to scan, And proue by th? (what Death did) thou wer't man: Yet seeing that past credit, she descends To view thy body, and her venom spends Not against it but nature, which did shroud So great a sunne vnder so small a cloud. But we that plainly see men sildome rise Though they be learn'd, iudicious, daring wise, Except the body somewhat suites the minde, And good cloathes sute the body too; are blinde And mad with enuie if we yeeld not thee Worth aboue thought, who to that high degree Rose through the eminent parts of thy blest soule, Aboue contempt, disgrace, scorne or controule. Nature did recompence thy want of clay With heauenly fire; thy body could not stay Thy actiue soule heere longer, t'was too light A clog to keepe from Heauen so strong a spright. Well might thy body be a soule to those Whose more grosse earthen soules did late compose Blacke libels gainst thy fame, and rak'd so low Into thy purged excrements to know What foule disease durst kill thee, and then found Many were guilty: for it could not sound They thought like truth, that one disease slue thee When they hauing all yet scape to Deddick free. By this they shew that whatsoe're we thinke, They know all these diseases by th'instinck, They are familiar with them and of kin, To their first causes of being deadly sinne, And of the elders house too. For the diuell (Chiefe libeller formes all degrees of euill And like good boies of his, these labour too (More then disease, or Death, or Hell can doe) To kill the soule, and to bely a fame Which laughes to scorn, all scorn, &amp; shames all shame. You that stand next the helme and thinke y're free From their sharpe viperous tongues, it cannot be; If death comes, these Rauens follow, and perchance (Time fauouring their desires) th'eile leade the dance And raile at you too. Tis not you they hate But our blest King, Religion, and the State. And if (which God forefend) so stood the time Y'ould see they could do worse, then they can rime. Now I haue throwne my selfe into the way To meete their rage, and (if I can) to stay Their dog-like malice rather on my head Then suffer it pollute and wrong the dead. If they alledge I giue him more then due, You know their custome, they cannot speake true. But if they say I gaue him lesse, their spite Shewes neither I nor they can do him right. OPPORTVNE TIBI INTEMPESTIVE NOBIS. The Sunne past by degrees those signes Which to his sotherne seate inclines, And now in Leo sate aloft. The sweating labourer bans him oft, The Shepheard melts, and ore the Plaine His new shorne-sheepe seeke shades in vaine. The Marchant, Sea man, euery Trade They say by him are Banckrupt made. He heares it and (at height of noone, Hides his bright beames behinde the Moone. They sadly know that doth presage Dearth, death, warre, want to euery age And then his late wisht absence mone; “Fooles wisemen misse, when they are gone. [Since its decreed in heauen, found true on earth] Since its decreed in heauen, found true on earth, That all things haue an end which had a birth; That no estate is fixed, nights follow noone, Ebs second floods, change fils the horned Moone Which wanes againe at full, and shewes the glory Of Earths best essence to be transitory: How happy is that Man whose fate expires Before declension crowned with his desires. And hath his daies by vertuous actions told, Guessing how much he would had he been old, Since yong, his noted deeds out-vied his daies And he lack't not true worth but rather praise. Few touch this point, yet hither seeme to bend Preuenting ruine with a violent end. So Otho, and the Persian Monarch fell, But this steepe way precipitates to Hell Flattering with seeming help our wretched state Not curing woes, but making desperate. Our way is holy, white, and leades to blisse Not by oblique attempts. For nature is Made priuy with our passage, and we stay Till she leades gently on, Grace making way. Not euery common President can fit This golden rule, all aime; but few can hit This narrow passage which more fames the man, Then sayling twise through fatall Magelan: Or girding all the earth with one small bote, Discouering gold, new worlds, things of rare note. From hence the ground of thy great praises spring O Cecill lou'd of God, good men, the King, Borne vp not by stolne imps or borrowed plumes, Which lets them fall who with high flight presumes Neere the suns scorching beames; thy natiue worth, Vertue, and actiue knowledge, set thee forth This Kingdomes Pilot, where no storme or stresse Could make thee lose thy compasse or expresse [illeg.]shew of doubt, but firmely guide our state [illeg.]s th'adst beene ruler both of chance and fate. This well thy Master saw, who therefore plac'd thee next himselfe, and with high honors grac'd Thy great deserts: more could'st thou not desire Nor earth afford, yet that which we admire Was aboue this, euen in the top of these, Being neerer heauen thither to mount with ease, As if th'adst tane th'aduantage of the time On Greatnesse staires, helpt by good deeds to clime. O happy thou, but wretched creatures wee To see thy flight, and yet to slander thee: To feele the fruite of thy life wasting care, Which zealous for our good, no time would spare, To cherish nature, that we thus being free Should onely freedome vse to raile at thee. Our idlenesse proclaimes thy well spent time, Since by thy meanes we leisure haue to rime, Whil'st neighbour States are acting it in blood, Which we scarce heare of, neuer vnderstood. The benefite the Sunne giues to our sight, “We see not halfe so well by day as night. “Want giues a grace to goodnesse, when th'inioying Confounds and dazells sense like honny cloying. Rome needes no target till the sword be lost: Whil'st Nestor wakes, well may Thirsites boast. Fishers and expert Masters are all one In calmes and deepes, the ship there goes alone. But when the winds, seas, rocks, and sands do fight, The skilfull Master then keepes all vpright. We feare no stormes the Porpuses do play, The Dolphins dance, and Proteus flocks do stray O're Neptunes watry Kingdome safe and free, None casting doubts, or fearing what may be. May this calme last perpetuall, and faith then We ne're shall need thee Cecil nor such men: Others we haue to fill thy roome thou gone, So Aristippus saith; stone sits on stone. We yet are senselesse of thy losse, and find No danger in't. Like some within the winde Of a great shot, whose violent thunder driues, The sense into distraction, and depriues The eare of present vse: so did report Of thy death make vs mad to raile and sport, To temporise, lye, flatter; so defaming Our selues, state, manners, law, religion shaming: But now the fit being past, tis plaine to fense “Though man forbeares Heauen pleads for innocence “Vertue o'recomes by sufferance, and good deeds “Are fenc'd by Calumny, as herbes by weeds. BACVLVM TANTVM. The Cynicke sicke and like to die, To such as askt where he would lie, Made answere where you will; the field Is large, and roome enough doth yeeld. But they reply'de, the fields are wide; Rauenous beasts and vermine vilde Haunt those places; Kites and Crowes Who to dead men no mercy showes. True (quoth he) but if you please Lay a staffe to driue hence these. Tis only man I feare aliue, From my graue beasts only driue. “Though (liuing) we haue slaues for dogs, “Dead w'are rooted vp by hogs. EPITAPHIVM. Romes poison, Spaines coplots, the French designes Thy skill foresees, discouers, vndermines. Dog-like they lick'd the dust, crouch't low, and faund, When (liuing) thy skil'd power did ought command: But (dead) they madly rage, grin, some for spite; For toothlesse curres will bark that cannot bite. TO THE RIGHT WORTHY, Henry Doile, Esquire. The folly which in man with wit is fixt, Must needes haue pleasant things with wholesome mixt; Else Nature loath it. Homers frogs aud mise Instructs Achilles: Virgil is not nice To tue an Oten pipe. These toyes I send: Accept; to please, and profit is my end. SATYRA AVLICA. Sic paruis componere magna solebam. Virgi. VVho (weary of contentfull Countries rest) Repaires to Court, with patience had best Fore arme himselfe, both Fate and Fortune proofe 'Gainst all assaults, or wisely stand aloofe: For plainnesse is despisde, and honestie Is fellow Shakerag with simplicitie. To be a Scholler, is to be a foole: Rude impudencie is the Courtiers Schoole. Arts are but Lackies to attend and waite On Ignorance, Apparance, and Deceite. Canst thou seeme wise? Enough. This followes then, “Vizards haue fairer vizages then men. To be a Souldier is to be a slaue, Danger abroad, reproach at home to haue. Deepe furrow'd wounds fresh bleeding in the wars Findes lesse reliefe and pittie then the scars Of muskey Courtiers, when their smooth slicke skin, Is bramble-scratched with a Ladies pinne. Nor do they now, (as er'st they did) delight, The stubborne Steedes to mannage to the fight; To tilt and turnay with strong staues of oake, To fight at barriars with a Brandons stroake, To dance in compleat armour, (but alas!) To tilt, fight, dance and turnay with a lasse. The Schollership they vse, is to discourse Of my Lords bloud-hound, and his Honors horse: To tell how well the one pursued the chase, The other swiftly ranne a lustie race. Or if more high their heauy wits aspire, It's to dispute of lust, and loose desire. Their Soulderie is swaggering in the Court, Where none may strike the vrger but in sport: To offer strangers, strange and foule disgraces, Presuming on their priuiledged places, Which oft-times is repaide them, when they come Abroad from Court, they'r welcom'd like Iack drum. Their idle houres, (I meane all houres beside Their houres to eate, to drinke, drab, sleepe and ride) They spend at shooue-boord, or at penny pricke, At dice, cards, tennis; or they will not sticke Rather then not be idle, to delay At shittle-cocke the precious time away. O slaues! regard what slander doth arise From your effeminate slow cowardise. Haue you no Soules? no pens? no swords in hand? Behold where cursed Mæhomet doth stand, Triumphing o're the Crosse; he Iew beside And Heathen do our holy faith deride. For shame vnsheath your swords, let not reproch You sluggish ease is forraine kingdomes broch. Cast painted Puppets from your yeelding neckes And scorne to stoope when the stale Strumpet beckes: Let stallians serue to squench the scorching heate Of such as marrow, oysters, Ringoes, eate. You that are Scholers, souldiers, or such men Whose soules seeke knowledge, flee this shady den Of ignorance; let thither none resort But Taylors, Bauds, Perfumers, fooles for sport, Cookes, Painters, Barbers, Fidlers; these may hap To sleepe in fortunes net, and honors lap. In honors lap? auaunt base dunghell groomes You are but shadowes: honors lofty roomes Must be supplide with men. Though Isis Asse Thinke men adore his greatnesse as they passe. Yet Isis knowes tis false; then hence be gon And let desert be honored alone. Fortune vsurpe no more, permit not fooles To triumph ouer Souldiers, Arts, and Schooles. Let not the wit for higher actions able, Attend for scraps at Jgnoramus table. Faire Cynthia fill thy horne, at length arise And chase these blacke clouds from our troubled skies AN IRISH BANQVET, OR THE Mayors feast of Youghall. Tales many haue been told by men of yore, Of Giants, Dragons, and of halfe a score Worthies saue one, of Castles, kings and knights, Of Ladies loues, of Turnaies, and such sights As Mandeuile ne're saw; yet none like this Which my Muse howles: then listen what it is. Saturne grew old, and the gods did agree, That Ioue should him depriue of Soueraigntie, And become chiefe himselfe. A solemne day Appointed was, when all the Gods most gay, Attired in mantles faire, and truses strange, Came to behold this Lecher-like lou'd change. The frie of all the Gods was there beside, And each his bastard had, his Whore and Bride. The milk-white path which to Ioues Pallace leades, In comely order all this rich troope treades. Ceres threw wheate vpon Ioues face most daintie, Presaging and forespeaking future plenty. The well-instructed swine did follow after, And for the wheat left something that was softer, Ciuet, like Irish sope. Sweete naturde beasts, Fit waiters at such ciuill solemne feasts. At length the traine reach't the high Hall of Ioue. The Gods sat downe, the Goddesses then stroue For place and state: but Iuno most demurely, Plac'de and displac'de that day, as pleasde her surely, The tables stood full crownde with dainty dishes, Enough to satisfie the idle wishes Of longing Wiues, or Maids grown green and sickly, With eating fruit, and doing nothing quickly. Huge hands of butter not yet fully blue, With quiuering custards of a doubtfull hue. Stewde prune, and bread that passeth Malahane. And honny sweeter farre then sugar cane. Greene apples and such plenty of small Nuts. That therewith safely one might fill his guts, Though he were sure the Cookes were Irish sluts. The goblets sweld with pride, themselues to see, So full of French and Spanish wines to be. Nectar-like Vsqua-bath, or Aqua-vitæ, And browne Ale growne in yeeres and strength most mighty Was there as plentifull a Bonniclabbar, That euery guest his cleane lickt lips might slabbar In full satiety, till they were crownde With Bacchus wreathes, and in still slumber drownde. The fidling Spheeres made musicke all the while And riming Bardes braue meeter did compile To grace this feast: when Phœbus standing vp Tooke in his greasie fist a greasier cup And drunke to Daphnes health. Bacchus replide And straightway quaft another to the bride Of Mulciber. This health past all along. Then Mars his feather wagde amongst the throng Carowsing Pallas health (braue wench and wise) Which draught cost bonny Cupid both his eyes, Straining to pledge it. Maias sonne stood still, And stilly mark't how Ganimed did fill The seuerall healths, which swiftly past around Till all the Gods, and Goddesses had bound Their browes with wreathes of Iuy leaues and vines, And each his forehead to his knee enclines. Apollo then slipt thence, and being halfe drunke His burning bonnet doft, and slily sunke His head in Thetis lap. So heauen lost light, And cheerefull day was damp't with irksome night. Ioue yet disposde to mirth, bad Iuno spread Her Starry mantle or'e the worlds blacke head. But she inrag'de with plumpe Lyeus iuice, And mad with iealousie, without excuse Refusde to guild the then vnspangled skie, With th'eyes of Argus her cow-keeping spie. And aided by Necessitie, and Fate, And all the shrewder Goddesses, Ioues state She durst assume, and boldly presse as farre As all the Gyants in their ciuill warre. They first bound Ioue, then all the other Gods, Who were constrain'd by darknes, drinke, and th'ods Of this conspiracie, to condescend To hard conditions for a quiet end. Ioue granted Iuno power of all the ayre, Her frowne or smile makes weather fowle or faire. His thunderbolts and lightning she may take, And with her tongue the worlds firmes axtree shake. From hence do women their free charter hold, To rule gainst reason, or else cry and scold. Proserpina obtained of her Pluto, That such should only speed, who she-saints sue to: That all affaires of man in state or purse His wife should sway, or women that are worse. From whence this custome springs in towne and city, The wife growes rich, the bankerout begs for pitty. Venus got leaue to lie with all that loue her. And that no sawcy god should once reproue her: That Mars and she might dally, whil'st Don Vulcan Should freely to their pleasures drinke a full can. Fr? whence this vse proceeds, that wiues once w?tons Wage seruants, as the French the Swizzers Cantons. You that are Statists looke vnto this geare, Do not Tyrone and his rash striplings feare; Feare not Tirconnel, nor those Galliglasses That cut, and hacke, and carue men as it passes: Feare those which all these feare, those fathers holy Which make the whole world their sole monopoly: That crowne &amp; vncrowne Kings, when as they please, Play fast and loose like Iuglers with slight ease; Dissolue all othes, though made with hand and heart, those they ioyne with, lest too late We finde our Ile an Amazonian state, Where none but women, Priests and Cocknies keepe As close as young Papirius, and as deepe, And none but these state mysteries may know, Lest they to more fooles then themselues should show The treasons, stratagems, and golden fables Which are proiected at their Councell tables. If this aduice be good, crie, Ioue be thanked, And with that short grace close my Irish banquet, To all those Knights, Ladies, and Gentlemen, to whom my Dedications are made, a true reason and excuse why I haue not placed them in their rankes and distances. If any of you now be discontented, To haue your names found here, it is repented On my part too: for I would no man wrong Nor honour, but for merit in my song. If here yon finde your vertues be not proude, But thinke you are by me and truth allowde To weare Fames liuery, which if y'abuse, Shee'l soone pull off againe; and as you vse To deale with your euill seruants, put ye forth Naked of honour, if you be of worth: But whilst you be what now I know and write, Your fames guard me, and I giue you your right; Yet not in place, for I my selfe professe To be no Harold; but if worthinesse Had as much power, as many hath, to grace, You should not (hauing so much worth) want place.

      <field name="fulltext">THE SECOND PART Of PHILOMYTHIE, Or PHILOMYTHOLOGIE. CONTAINING CERTAINE TALES Of True Libertie. False Friendship. Power Vnited. Faction and Ambition. MONARCHIA. DEDICATED To all the worthy professors of the Law, who make not priuate-wealth, but the good and peace of the Common-wealth the end of their studies and practise. Though you (perhaps) be Clyentlesse and few, Friendlesse and poore, yet 'tis to you I sue For kinde acceptance. You alone are they Who by example guide vs in our way. You looke not on the fee, but on the cause, And follow truth, as truth doth lead the Lawes. The rest, with vice, and wealths ill-gotten load, Passe on to death, in glories beaten road. Th'inhabitants of the Ile of Wight did bost, No vermin vs'd to harbour in their coast. For they no hooded Monkes, nor Foxes had, Nor Law Retriuers who make fooles run mad, With their strife-stirring tongues; but liu'd as free, From these, as by them others combred be. And though our whole land cannot boast so farre, That we from all such vermin quitted are: Yet happy is our Ile, that's hemd about With water-walles, to keepe our enemies out; Whilst we (as Adam did) in Eden dwell, And scarce of famine in an age heare tell. Where hils are clad with woods, and vales with corn Whose laden eares doe listen to be shorne. Where shephearde neither Lyon doubt, nor Beare, Nor rauening Wolfe which sheep &amp; shepheard teare; But each in safety dwell, and sillie sheepe From all but Man, doe one the other keepe. O happy are we if we know our good, And if our state be rightly vnderstood: To liue thus free vnder so blest a King, Iust Magistrates and Cleargy-men, that sing, The songs of Syon in the holy tongue Conuerting old men, and informing yong. No spirit-tyrant, Pope, State, Tyrant, Turke. Can here their bloudy ends and proiects worke; But each in safety may his owne possesse, More free then Kings, because our cares be lesse. But most vnhappy are those neighbour lands, Where Peace, and Plenty, as two strangers stands; Where bloodie war, and bloodlesse famine ride Vpon the ruin'd top of thanklesse Pride: Where Law destroies, Diuinity deceiues, And where the crowne the care of kingdome leaues. Where men eate men, as beast deuourd by beast, The strong the weaker kill, the great the least. Where tyrannie in triumph mounted hie, Makes truth and innocence indungeon lie. This tale the difference shewes, that wee may know How much to God for our good king we owe. An aged Hart, vpon mount Carmel bred, Hauing as Admirall the Nauy led From Syria through the Seas, to Cyprus shore, Where all the Ile with greene is couered o're. Hapt by a Parke to trauaile, where he spide A yonger sad Hart, standing close beside Th'imprisoning pale, and vsing all his skill To free himselfe from thence, to larger ill. Good brother (quoth the stranger) let me know, What heauy thoughts they are that vex you so? Why do you sadly so your selfe bemone? Why hauing friends within come you alone To feed sad melancholly, and inuent To doe a rash act, which youle soone repent? The younger Deere made answer, Can ye muse Why I am sad, and wherefore I doe vse All meanes to free my selfe, from being thus A slaue to him that's foe to all of vs? Know brother, I endure more sorrowes here, In one halfe day, then you in one whole yeere. For you haue liberty to come and goe, Though forrester and wood-man both say no. But I by cruell man, imprisond keepe, Within this woodden walls, where none but sheepe Hares, Conyes, Cowes, and other of my kinne Are my associates, simple soules within. I haue no beast of worth, of birth, or wit, With whom I may conuerse; but faine to fit My lofty spirit to the lowly straine, Of base companions, sluggish, fearefull, vaine. No Wolues or Dogs come here, whereby decaies The exercise of valure and the praise. The traps for vermin, are so thicke beset, That oftentimes they some of vs doe get. The watchfull keeper, euery night and morne, Commands me rise, and rest with his shrill horne, He with his Lymehound rounds the pale about, For feare least we be stolne or broken out. He feeds vs cheerefully, and doth prouide Sufficient meat that's fit for euery tide; But being fat, he chooseth which he likes, And through our sides, deaths forked arrow strikes. Thus all he doth, is his owne turne to serue, And for his owne life doth our liues preserue. Then gentle brother helpe to free me hence, And my swift thanks shall yeeld you recompence. Stay brother mad-brain stay, quoth Light foot th? If you were out, you'ld wish you in agen. I was in Syria borne, and euery yeere A dangerous voyage make, for what you here Enioy with proud contempt. We cannot find “Content on earth, without a thankfull mind. You slight your ease and plenty; we, alas! With toyle seeke that which you with scorne let passe. Our meat is grutchd, we like to robbers watcht, So what we feed on, here and there is snatcht. The pale you call your prison rather may, Be tearmd your Castle, Garden, Closet, Stay, To keepe out others from those ioyes of yours, Or to preserue you from these woes of ours. Whilst we without by Lyons, Leopards, Beares, Wolues, Eagles, Serpents, and a thousand feares, Are howrely vext, beset, besieged so, That as our shadowes, death doth next vs goe. Yet none our deaths reuenge, nor craues account, How our neglected blood is lauisht out. For euen that Man (which is your guard) to vs Proclaimes himselfe a foe, most dangerous. He hunts for our destruction cheeres the hound, Rides, runs, whoopes, hollowes, and at euery sound, Rings our shrill deaths bell with so fearefull blast, As charmes our ioynts to heare, whilst hounds make hast To finish our desired death, and glut VVith our sweet flesh, each vermins maw and gut. Thus doe we die abroad, for euery man Claimes right in vs, and labors all they can, Our weary feet in toyles, nets, snares t'inclose, VVhen you haue friends, to guard you from your foes If therefore you haue told me truth that there You doe no creature but your keeper feare; O bring me to this prison, shew me how I may obtaine a blessed life with you. Direct me to a leape, ile soone leape in. “Tis happinesse, vnhappy to haue been. VVith that he mounts the pale, and adue quoth he, Vaine, wide, wild world; who serues the law is free. The Cony-burrow. Dedicated to the louers of worth, and friends of vertue, who follow truth with a single heart, and speake it with a single tongue. Be innocent, but circumspect withall, The Turtles mate may be the Turtles stall. Be wise yet trust not wit. The traps we make For others, first doe our false fingers take. What we delight to vse, take pride to weare, Take vs; as Absalon hangd with his haire. Then walke vpright, to neither hand encline, There's nought frees innocence, but grace diuine. The Polcat, Ferret, Lobstar, Weasell, made A secret match, the Cony to inuade: VVhich no way they could compasse, whilst he kept Himselfe abroad, when as hee fed or slept. At last the Polcat to the Cony went, With this smooth speech. Good cousen my intent Hath been long since t'acquaint you with our kin, And tell ye how our cousenage came in. Your Grandame was my carefull fostermother, To your kind Sire, I was a fosterbrother; My education, nurture, and my foode, I from my youth receiued from your sweet brood. In recompence whereof, my thankfull mind, A fitte requitall long desired to finde. The time is come, for I haue lately found, A secret plot, wherein the cunning hound The close dissembling Tumbler, Lurcher swift, With Raynard that knowes many a subtill shift. The Eagle and the Goshauke, haue agreed, Their stomacke with your dainty flesh to feed. First they intend the hound shall hunt you out, And by your footing heate ye once about. Then shall that hypocrite, the Tumbler trie, To cheate you of your life, with his false eie. But if he faile, the Lurcher with his speed, Will snatch yee vp (they hope) and do the deed. If not the Eagle, Fox, and Goshauke, sweare, To eat no meat, till on your lims they teare. The harmlesse Cony; at this dire report, Ready to sound, besought in humble sort The wary Polcat him t'instruct and teach A way, how he might scape his foes long reach. Faith (quoth the Polcat) you perhaps might hide, Your selfe among thicke bushes vnespide, But that the Hounds and Lurcher both are there, whose sents will quickly find ye out, I feare. Againe vpon the rocks, you might remaine, But that the Eagle, Fox, and Goshauke saine Thei'l watch ye there; so that no other way Remaines to scape with life, but night and day To scrape and grate with your forefeet, a den, Within the earth, where safe from beasts and men, And foule, and euery bloody foe you shall, Your life securely lead in spite of all. The simple Cony doubting no deceit, Thought treason had not councell for a bait And therefore thanks his foe, and (glad at heart) To dig his owne graue vseth all his art. A sandy place he seeks, and finding one, Free from all clay, or flint, or other stone, He with his forefeet grates, and makes a burrow, As deepe, as if he ment to trauaile thorow, The body of the earth, and meet the Sunne, When it vnto the Antipodes doth run. Which hauing finisht, he prepares a feast, And there the Polcat is the chiefest guest. The Lobster, Ferret, Weasel too must goe, To ioy him in his house, they loue him so; And their great friend, the siluer-suited Snake, Must needs along with them, and merry make. He welcomes them, and doth before them set, What iunckets he with purse or paines could get. The Lyons Court hath not a dainty dish, But he prouides it, euen beyond their wish. “Yet they that long for blood, till blood be shed, “Cannot be satisfied, though fully feed. Ingratitude! thou monster of the minde Art thou not only proper to mankind? Is there a beast that can forget his friend, And for his owne ends, worke his fellowes end? Is there a beast whose lust prouokes him kill The beast that did him good, nere wisht him ill? Is there a beast who vnder kindnesse can Dissemble hate? O then thrice happy man! Thou art not only he that kilst thy brother, Some beasts there are that murther one another. Some foules, some fishes, Serpents some there are VVho pray vpon their kind in open war. And some that vnder friendship falsly faind, VVith fellowes murther haue their natures staind. Nay there is one who can so couer euill, That man may iudge him Angell, find him diuell. He first with sweet meats poysond Adams seed, Since when of sweet meats wisest men take heed. So need not these bold guests, they eat and drink And then rise vp to play; but neuer thinke Ought fadgeth right, till they haue brought to passe The purposde plot for which this meeting was. Therefore (dissemblingly) the Polcat gins, To licke and catch the Cony, and so wins Hold vnderneath his throat, which hauing fast, The tragedy begins, the sport is past. For all assault him then on euery part, Some at his sides, some at his head and heart. Some at his belly, but the poisonous Snake, Doth at his tayle a deadly issue make. The helplesse Cony sues, intreats, and striues, But he must die had he ten thousand liues. Each foe his greedy gorge with blood doth glut And with his sweet flesh cram each hollow gut. “But blood that's sweet in tast, is not so sound, “To feed vpon, as milke that's easier found. The Snake with poisonous touch had venome spred, Through all the swelling vaines, from taile to head. And they had suckt the blacke infection in; A fitting vengeance for their crying sinne. Straight they their stomacke find not well at ease, And something feele, that doth their minds displease. The VVeasel first suspects the Snake, for he Can neuer with a Serpent well agree; Saies, they are poisond all by one base slaue, VVhose company the Ferret needs would haue. The Snake replies, he did no more but what He was appointed to performe by plot. And if they foolishly had eat their last, He could not mend with sorrow what was past. They find it true, but find it now too late, Each rauing dies, and yeelds constraind by fate. Yet ere they die, all doe their farewell take, By shaking teeth together on the Snake. VVho deadly wounded, crawles but faintly thence, Confounded with the guilt of his offence. And heeding not his way, by good mishap, Became a prisoner to the warriners trap. This feast was ended thus, death tooke away, And where they did not well we mend it may. The House of Fame. Dedicated to all the noble attendants of Royaltie in the Campe of Vertue, who fight for the honor of the Church, and Common-wealth. Till now of late we feard that loud report, Of Cressy field, Poicters, and Agincourt, Fought by our Kings and Princes heretofore, Had not been true, or should betold no more. We wondred if those Nobles euer were Whom fame for armes and bounty did prefer: We doubted all our Countries had forgot. The deede of Audely or beleeu'd it not We thought our Nation was of worth bereft, When bowes and arrowes and browne bills were left. But see, occasion now hath turnd our eyes, To inward wars where greater wonders rise. To see affection conquerd, lust chastisd'e, Pride humbled, Murther slaine, all vice despisd'e. And all old vertues freshly now reneude, By faire examples as the Sun ere vewd. In which braue war of wonders (passing far All other conflicts that compounded are (Of loue and hate) each Lord who lends a hand To fight against vice for vertue, doth this land More honor then his ancestors before In conquering France, and shall be famd for't more. Some for their Prudence who found out and led, Others for zeale through whom the enemy fled. Others for Art, whose skill the squadrons placed Others for Iustice who the enemy chased, And some for Constancie, who held it out. And still vnwearied, not vnwounded fought. But none more fame attaind then mercies squire, Who begd to giue, all sauing in desire, He Audely-like taught Courtiers how to craue What they might giue away, and giuing saue, Saue free from feare of forfeiture or losse, Or there-begging or the next yeeres crosse: Or enuies eye-sore, or the Commons hate, Or poores complaint, or grieuance of the state, To him and to the rest, this tale is sent, Howsoeuer taken with a good intent. Fame that in Homers time a vagrant was, Without a house and home, did after passe In stately structures all the mixed race Of Semdeities, and euery place Built her a Court, assisted by the Rages Of sundry Poets in succeeding ages. For euery one did something adde, to frame More space and roome for their friends narrow fame. Which as they purchast, still to her they gaue And that's the cause, themselues so little haue. This Fame hath now her house glazde all with eies, The rafts, beames, balkes, nerues, sinewes, arteries; The dores wide open, eares; hangd round about With nimble tongues, and couerd so without. All things are seene and heard the wide world ore Which touch that place, and farthest off the mone. The House of Fame built vp foure stories hie, Stands in an open plaine, in which doth lie Foure sister twins, True same, and good the first, And eldest are; false and had fame the worst. And youngest payre, yet swiftest are in flight And though last borne, yet oft come first to light. These last dwell in two darker roomes below, Among the thicke Crowdes where all errors grow. There keepe they Court, where Scandals, Libels, lies, Rumors, Reports, Suspicions, calumnies, Are fauorites and Gouernors of State, Whose practise 'tis true worth to ruinate. False fame liues lowest, and true Fame aboue, Bad Fame next false, good fame next, true doth moue: Yet good fame somtime doth with false fame stay, And bad fame sometime doth with true fame play. But false and true (opposd) will neuer meete, Nor bad and good fame, one the other greete. It so fell out (as oft strange things befall) A gallant Knight, ariued at that faire Hall, Attended on with such a noble sort, Of warlike squires, as fild this spatious Court. Who curiously enquiring of the rout, Whose Court it was, could no waies find it out. For contradictions crosse each other so, As truth from falshood he could no waies know. Bad fame did call it hers, and said, she was A guide to such as vnto glory passe. False Fame did call it hers; he saw they lide, For 'boue their heads, two brighter Queens he spide. True fame spake to him then, and let him know, That she and good fame did the building owe, Being eldest borne, to Titan and the Earth, Before the Gyants war: when th'others birth Long since was subiect to their parents sinne, And heauens curse which now they liued in. For as those Gyants gainst the Gods did war, So these to truth professed enemies are; Had by strong hand, and fraud, vsurpd her state: And to expresse to vertue vtmost hate, Had bard all passage to their houses hie, That mortall men might in obliuion die Or haue their memories blasted, glories kild By eating time, with lies and slanders fild. She wisht him then if he his good desired To haue repeated, or his spirit aspired To worthy honor as old knights had wont, (Whose swords not rust, but too much vse did blunt) That he would vse some meanes to set them free, Whereby his blest name might eternizd be. Good Fame then told him, that the only way, How he this enterprize accomplish may, Was by the helpe of mercy, prudence, art, Iustice and zeale, and Constancy of heart. All their knowne friends to summon vp in armes, To force the place, and to disperse those swarmes Of idle vagabonds; who kept below And hated good Fame, would not true fame know. Then (since the stayres of fame were broken downe, And does stopt vp to glory and renowne) She wild him make an engine wherewithall, He might her lodging and her sisters scale. And so himselfe in spite of perill, raise Aboue the reach of enuy, or dispraise. The Knight (in spirit rauisht with delight To heare their speech, to see their goodly sight) Mounts his fierce Coursers backe, with which at hand His Squires attend vpon his strict command. Wils euery one of them to take a dame, Such as the Ladies of the house did name, Who there attended that they might direct This high attempt, with order and respect. The Squires with willing minds the knight obaide, And each behind them tooke a louely maide. Prudence directs her Squires to lead the way, (Who followes her direction cannot stray,) At length they come vnto a fruitfull wood, Wherein a world of vpright timber stood; Tall Cedars, Cypres, Pine and royall Okes, With country Elmes, and Ash for plow and yokes. The learned Laurell, and the weeping Mirrh, The smarting Birch, and the sweet smelling Firr Grew there in order, and all trees beside, Wherein the thrifty Woodreeue taketh pride, The knight suruaies all this, yet finds not one Fit to be feld; till Prudence lights upon A proud straight Aspe, whose wauing top did leane On a slight Poplar, with some shrubs betweene. The cursed Eldar, and the fatall Yewe, With Witch and Nightshade in their shadowes grew; Whose saples tops, with mildewes often stood, And grew self-feare, and ouertopt the wood. The Rauen &amp; Shreikeowle there did build their neasts, And at their roots did harbour harmefull beasts, Which Prudence saw, but mercy would not see, Till she perceiu'd how euery other tree Droop'd vnderneath the height of these alone, And could not thriue, or grow till these were gone. She therefore (ioynd with Constancie and Zeale) Besought sharpe Iustice, who doth euenly deale Her warie blowes, to fell all these with speed; Who soone consents, and soone, performes the deed. At euery stroke she fetcht, the trees did grone, The rest did eccho laughter to their mone. And now they lye along, their branches topt, Their barke pild off, their trunks asunder chopt. Then Art with rule and line, these vselesse payer Frames (engine-like) a straight clowd climing stayer To mount Fames house; this euery Squire doth reare And brauely on their backs do thither beare. But Mercy seeing all the other ment To burne the Chips, to saue them she is bent. And, with her Squire, the knight praies, let them lye, For he shall gaine, and glory get thereby. Since chips which cut from Aspe and Poplar bee, Do soone take roote, each growes a goodly tree. The knight consents, and fenceth round the spring. Whose forward growth doth hope of profit bring. And now, together to the house of Fame With speede they passe, where first the falsest Dame Salutes them with a lye, and saith she heares Her Sisters are together by the eares, And haue destroyde each other; this she had From her Twin sister, who tells rumors bad. They slight her leasings, and with speedy assay To raise the lather, where bold Zeale makes way; But false Fame and her Sister, lay about To hinder her, with all their rascall route. Slander, foole-hardines and heartles feare, With foolish Pittie, and false Loue was there, Damnde Infidelitie, and secret Hate, And treason too, that close dissembling mate. Who all with open mouth, and open lyes, All waies to stop his honord worke deuise. They raile, and fight, intreat, and curse and ban. The Knight proceedes, in scorne of what they can. And mounts the ladder, with his sword in hand, Which soone disparkles, such as dare withstand. Zeale hales him vp, and Prudence guides him right, True Constancie encourageth the fight, Mercy saues all the innocent, who swarme For companie, not with intent of harme; Art orders euery act, the engine staies And helpes the Knight step after step, to praise The lusty squires below, with sword and lance, Withstand bad fame, whilst Iustice doth aduance Her heauy hatchet, and strikes off the head Of both the leaders, and there leaues them dead. Which when their troopes discouer, they forsake Th'vsurped fortresse, and themselues betake. To heady flight, into a marsh neere hand, Where many whispering reeds and Osiars stand. There they like out-lawes do themselues inclose, In wilfull banishment, with all the foes Of this good knight, whose valure vndertooke This high attempt, that Fame might rightly looke On all deseruers, and that man might finde, Like freedome for his tongue, as for his mind. That vertue might be crowned by true fame, And honest meaning liue with honored name. Which promise gladly both the sisters swore, In solemne forme; and now as heretofore The freedome of their tongues they both possesse; And worth is knowne from base vnworthinesse. The knight they humbly thanke, and him they crowne The Soueraigne of glory and renowne. Which stile, Fames trumpetters the foure winds blow Through th'earths foure quarters, that the world may know Th'extent of vertuous actions; how no power Can stop their passage, nor lanke time deuoure Their sweet remembrance; which shall liue as long As nature hath an eare, or eye, or tongue. To euery Squire then they this fauour giue, That after death their Fames shall euer liue; For still those Ladies, whose imploiment they So well aduanc' t'shall duly night and day Repeate their labors, and prefer them far Beyond Alcides workes, as peace doth war Surpasse in glory, or those works we doe, When others wills, and ours we conquer too. Now 'tis proclaimd that if we tell no lies, We may with boldnesse speake and feare no spies. That what this age hath done, this age may heare, As well repeated now as the next yeere. That all our words our selues shall first expound, And that no forc't construction shall confound Our honest meaning, but bee't ill or well, We may with freedome our opinions tell. Since no man dares to doe the thing which he, Would haue all the world both heare and see. These orders ratified, they fall to sport, And fill with maskes and reuells all the Court. The sequel I refer to Fames relation, Whose golden trumpe sounds vs a blessed nation. Satellitium. Dedicated to all that stand Sentinell, that watch and ward in defence of this kingdome, especially to the strength and guard of the State. Be of one minde; Religion tyes a knot, Which none vndoes, by practise or by plot. But if in that we differ, be our breed Within one house, or wombe, of all one seede. “Tis seuerd soone by hate, respect, or gold, Which Law can neuer soulder, art make hold. “Faith only ioynes, what nothing sunder can. “Beasts loue for benefits, for vertue Man. VVho guarded round about, with Parthian bowes, Or Spanish pikes; or hedg'd and dikt with rowes Of sturdie Ianisaries, or the shot Of hardy Swizzars, or the valiant Scot, And after these with walles of steele and brasse, Hemd in so close that scarce the ayre may passe Betwixt the cliffes, is not so free from doubt, As is that King whom loue doth guard about. Whom subiects loue doth guard, because that he Guards them from all oppression, and makes free His noble fauourers to desert and worth, Spreading his valiant vertues frankly forth, That both his owne may finde, and neighbors know, What glorious fruit doth from religion grow. How sweet an odor Iustice sends to heauen, How rare example is to Princes giuen, By vertuous deeds, to stop the mouthes of those, Who vnreform'de are reformations foes. Such one sleepes safe within the armes of loue, Diuine regard doth all his subiects moue To due obedience; and with sacred awe Binds conscience, with a stronger bond then lawe. Such heauen informes, whilst hell doth vndermine, And spite of darkest plots with grace diuine Doth hedge about, that naked in the armes Of enemies he is preseru'd from harmes. They sleepe securely, feed on holsome cates, Angels their beds make, cookes their delicates Giues Antidotes gainst poysons, doth defend Gainst damned witches and their God the fiend, No Iesuits at their elbowes can do hurt, Nor troopes of Papists that their courts ingirt. For God doth them in his blest armes inclose, Safe, though their chiefest fauourites were foes. O happy then good Kings proceed, ride on, Grow vp in glory, as you haue begun. Ride on for truths sake, looke on either hand, How you are guarded with a heauenly band Of blessed spirits, who shall lead you still In holy paths, and guide your steps from ill. These being with you, you shall boldly tread Vpon the Lyon, and the Dragons head, And trample danger vnderneath your feete, As men tread stones, or dirt within the street, Which only spraids them; your heauen-garded state Is safer far, then that of Mithridate, The King of Pontus, vnto whom befell, VVhat strange aduenture in this tale I tell. This King perceiuing well there was no band, Of duty, loue, or nature, could withstand The strong inticement of corrupting gold, Or baser lust, or humor ouerbold, Or fond ambition (which makes empty slaues Swim bladder borne vpon the floting waues Of false Opinion, with the arme of pride, Of borrowed power, and ignorance beside) But that these would peruert the faith they had, And cause them after farther hopes run mad; Did to preuent all this, a guard prouide Of faithfull beasts, whose strength had oft been tried. A Bull, a Horse, a Hare, the Captaines were, Of this strong guard, whose force did nothing feare But falshood, and Ingratitude, and Treason, From which they were as free, as man from reason VVhy knowing more then beasts, he should not hate As they doe, to be treacherous, and ingrate. These three together being put to feed, And sport themselues till there were farther need Of their knowne faith, together long did dwell In peace and loue, till on a time it fell That they with rest and ease full fed and fat, Had time to play, to dally, and to chat. Then did the wanton Hart propound a course, Betwixt himselfe and the couragious Horse. The warlike Horse did dare the horned Bull To make one in the race, who straight way full Of burning choller, and adusted blood, Bad cowards run, hee for no footman stood. Twas meet for them that durst not stand it out, To vse their heeles, his heart was too too stout. The angry Hart replies, ther's none of you, But may to me as to your better bow, I swifter then the Horse, my feet can vse, And for my head, the Bull ile not refuse To combat with, my courage I am sure Is like my strength as able to indure, And doe, as either of you dare or can, And more I am esteemd by royall man. Those Serpents which you run from, I seeke forth, And teare them with my teeth as nothing worth. And as my life to man is sweet and pleasing, So is my death, each part some sorrow easing. My hornes all mortall poyson can expell, My marrow makes stiffe-ioynted misers well. My fat yeelds strength and sweetnesse; that fierce lad Achilles, neuer other spoonemeat had. Which made him such a Captaine, euery part Is physicall and comforteth the heart. Yea euen my excrements the dropsie cures, My teares, like precious Iewels, man allures. To seek them vp, wheresoeuer they be shed. My skin great Captaines weare when I am dead; And boast that they haue such a coat of proofe, Which wounds withstands, whence venome stands aloofe. Then why) O baser creatures) dare you brag And match your selues with the long liuing Stag? My life is long, cause I with cost am wrought, But nature slights your liues, as good for nought. The crested Horse, with fiery eyes did show, What inward rage did in his hot blood flgw To heare this bold speech vttered, and with head Tost in the ayre his hardned hoofes doth tread The scornd earth with contempt, then thus breaks out; O thou fearefull of all the rout Of hunted beasts, how haps it that you dare With me your master and your Lord compare? Forget ye my preheminence? the loue Man beares me? how one spirit seemes to moue Me and my rider? that we start and run, Stop, turne, trot, amble, as we were but one? Haue you at any time been calld to war, Where none but Captaines and great Souldiers are? Trusted to heare their Councels? on your backe Borne the Commander of that royall packe? I haue done this and more, borne him about Through worlds of danger, and then borne him out He trusts me when his legs he dare not trust, And when his hand, faile them performe I must. Nay when he failes himselfe in euery part, I adde another life, another heart. In war I thus befriend him, in his need, And so in peace, I helpe his wants to feed. I till this land that else would barren be, Beare all his carriage, and am seldome free From some imploiment, but must neere him stand As being fit, and apt for his command. If he to visit friends abroad doth fare, I must along with him, true friends we are. If he intends to hunt such beasts as you, For sport, or hate, or need, he lets me know The time, the place, the end, and we agree, I see the sport, and hunt as well as he. How often haue I seene some fearefull Hart, Perhaps your sire, at my dread presence start; Fly hence with vtmost speed, and neuer slacke His willing pace, when I vpon my backe Bearing my noble master haue at length O'retane the lubber, hauing lost his strength? VVhilst I still foming courage, breathing sprite, Haue sought another conquest long ere night; And after that a third, vnwearied yet, Yet you your selfe as Paralell will set To match and ouermatch my worth, my force; As if weake Stags might braue the peerelesse Horse. For physicall receipts easily yeeld, Aliue I profit man, you being kild, This makes him seeke your death, my life to saue, Yet being dead my parts their vertues haue. VVhich I refer to others to relate, As scorning Hog-like to doe good so late. This only I conclude, If man should choose To saue but one, hee'd both of you refuse. The armed Bull sweld, puft and roard alowd, To heare the Hart so bold, the Horse so proud. And all the while they spake, he tost about With hornes and hoofes the dust; then bellowd out This bolder braue; What ignorance is this, That causeth both of you, so much amisse To boast your false worths, and neglect the true, Which rests in me, belongs to none of you? The Wolfe, the Greyhound, and each questing cur, Makes thee poore trembling Hart keepe such a stir, To shift thy layer, as if thy life were lost, With euery faint blast, that the leaues downe tost. And this couragious Horse, that makes a quoile, Of wounds in war, and tilling of the soyle, With many other vses fit for man, (As they that least can doe, best cauill can) Let this his answer be, the spur and bit Shewes man trusts not his courage, nor his wit. For if he tyre or faint, his spur prouokes, And prickes him forward, with continuall strokes. And if with head-strong heat, he madly rides, The bridle curbes him, and his folly guides. “All voluntary acts the actors praise, “Not such as others by constraint doe raise. “Out of our natures, whilst we easily are “Made instruments either of peace, or war. Else might our horned Heards, the rescue boast Of Hannibal, and his distressed hoast, When he with lights and torches tyde to vs, Escapt the trap, of lingring Fabius. But truth is far from such ostents, those deeds We call our owne, which from our choice proceeds. The yoke we beare, and wherewithall we till The earth for man, is by constraint, not will. What comfort from our flesh, or from our Cowes, By calues, or milke, or Cheese or Butter flowes, Or physicall receipts, as they are more, And vsefuller, then what you both before Haue mentioned, so freely I confesse Man hath in them the glory more or lesse. His wit and industry, in them is seene, And th' Authors goodnesse from whom first we been, War is the good you glory in, which springs From mans ambitious ignorance, and brings Wants, woe, and death, with many ills beside, To scourge vs all, through out great masters pride. Then at the best, you are but slaues to such, As feeding you, foode to their like doe grutch. And through your force, their owne reuengements take, Whilst you to stout men; cowards equall make. For what from you they borrow, they must grant They feare their foes enioy, whilst they doe want. Thus therefore all the nobler nations vse To fight on foot, whilst coward rather choose To share with beasts in glory, and to get Themselues a name, through your foole hardy heat. So you on them, and they on you depend, Such seruice iudgement neuer did commend. And thus in sportiue war, and warlike sport, You doe your rider from himselfe transport. Whilst you not man-like grow, but beast-like he Resembles you, in all these sports we see. Yea often to mischance you doe betray Your heedlesse rider, and in midst of play Precipitate his soddaine fortune so, That who hath you a faiend, shall need no foe; But may himselfe, a happy man proclaime, If by your meanes he scapes without a maime. But now if either of you, thinke you can, Out of your owne worthes, proue more fit for man, And better able to defend, and guard, Him whom we serue, from whom we haue reward, Then I can with my hornes, and harnast hide, Proceed to triall, I defie your pride; And with bold challenge summon you to fight, A triple combat, to decide the right. They both with eager appetite accept These wisht conditions, and by this haue stept For from each other; all prepard doe stand At full carere, to ioyne this treble band. The field triangle wise they euenly cast, And each with rage expects, that dreadly blast, Which warnes them charge. Each roreth out his wrath, Nor other need of drums or trumpets hath. The Hart doth bray, the bounding Steed doth neigh, The Bull doth bellow, deepe, and lowde and high. The earth doth tremble, and the ayre doth shun, This dreadfull thunder; as when laden gun Spits forth its load, in scorne to be restraind, The ayre giues way vnto the bullets chaind, As dreading to resist so mighty force, Thus meet the valiant Bull, the Hart and Horse. The Hart and Horse first touch tha'ppointed place Being more swift, and apter for the race. And let each other, with much danger feele The force of horned head, and armed heele. But ere a second bout they can performe, In comes the boystrous Bull, like winters storme, And seuers them with such a violent push, That they amazde, turne giddy with the rush. But (nimble both and actiue they repay The sturdie Bull, with all the speed they may. The Hart with his broadhornes, doth make him reele But the kinde Horse, vpholds him with his heele. The Bull thanks neither, for the one did pearce His hollow flanke, the other much more fearce, Did breake a rib, and bruise his shoulder blade, And taught him with lesse choller to inuade. Yet th'ods is soone recouer'd with his horne, Which hath the belly of the Courser torne. And rent one weaker beame, from branched Hart, As trees by thunder riuen, or clouen athwart. The subtle Hart, then shuns those ruder blowes, And tho'ds of handistrokes too dearely knowes The Horse taught by his wounds, doth keepe aloofe, And stands vpon defence, with hardned hoofe. The Bull assaults them both with watchfull eye, And seeks how he aduantages may spie. The Horse and Hart vpon their guard do stand, In doubt and iealousie, on either hand. The Bull assaults the Hart, but he giues way, And slips his furie with what slight he may. Yet turnes not head, as fearefull cowards will, But wefes aside, to tyre his foe with skill. The Bull then strikes the Horse a deadly cuff, But he requites him with a counterbuff. The Hart strikes in betwixt, the Bull turnes rownd, The Horse leaps right vp, doth coruet, and bownd; So at one instant, fatally they meete; The Bull his death meets from the Horses feet. The Hart th'aduantage takes, the Horse aloft Strikes his one horne into his belly soft, Which there hangs fast; the Horse doth with his fall. Breakes the Harts necke, this is the end of all None hath the conquest, all of them are slaine. Their deaths not doubted, long they there remaine, Till that the King their Master, hauing neede Of their attendance, goes his guard to feed, For none might tend them else, least they acquainted With others bribes, by treason should be tainted. So enters he the place, and there he spies What doth affright him, all his comfort lies Dead at his feet, then sadly going neere Their carrion corpes, he doth a murmur heare, As armed souldiers in a Citie sound, Or fire in th'ayre, or wind within the ground. And doubting the successe, three seuerall swarmes He sees prepar'd for fight, and vp in armes. Bees from the Bull, Waspes from the Horse do start, And Hornets from the melancholly Hart. He motions peace, and hopes to part the fray, They send three souldiers, who sends him away. For each of them doth fix his venomd sting, Within the flesh of the amazed King. He flies with speed from thence, they fight it out; The conquest all expect, all feare and doubt. But what befell I know not; this I know, The King cride out aloud. The euils that grow From pride, ambition, and excesse of grace, “Like thanklesse curs, flie in their masters face. “Beasts will be beasts, doe bounty what it can, “Tis cast away, thats giuen to worthlesse man. O Princes banish faction from the Court, It sowres all actions, leauens euery sport. And at the last, when it should sweetly close, From one false friend riseth a thousand foes. FINIS.</field>
