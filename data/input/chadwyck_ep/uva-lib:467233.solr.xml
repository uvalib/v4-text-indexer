      <field name="fulltext">TO THE SOLDIERS AND SAILORS OF THE ALLIED FORCES WHO ARE FIGHTING IN THE GREATEST WAR THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN AND TO THE MEMORY OF THOSE WHO HAVE FALLEN THIS BOOK IS INSCRIBED</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A PRAYER FOR PEACE Nearer the eagles swoop in darkening rings, Death scents his awful quarry from afar, While men in millions march to bloody war Hateless unhatedâat the word of kings; But somewhere hid beneath His secret wings The sons of God before a juster bar Plead in His name who bore the cross and scar For Love that sees clear-eyed what war-lust brings. Plead on, ye seers, with love-enlightened eyes, Hold up your hands to where the angels gaze With deep compassion on our human strife; Prayer moves the world with power beyond amaze, And they who see beyond this mortal life Know peace on earth in Heaven hath great allies. TO SIR EDWARD GREY Champion of peace, not all Northumberland But the world's heart that swears by England's name Beats with your heart to-day; and far-off fame Shall crown your courageâyou who dared to stand For plighted word and honour hand in hand, Who mindful how to greatness Britain came, Nursed back to life her immemorial flame, And scorned the tyrant's traitorous demand. Led by your words, and greater for her choice Great Britain fears not, knows her cause is just, And feels far better sink beneath the sea Than lose her ancient love of liberty, Than lift for might not righteousness her voice, And drag an empire's honour in the dust. TO GREAT BRITAIN Britain! you with a heart of flame One as in days gone by, You who honour your Nelson's name, How could you hear the word of shame Nor rise and give it the lie! Better endure war's worst of ills, The woe of a hundred fights, Than cower behind your banks and tills And smug with your money your mines and mills, Forswear a neighbour's rights. For how could you hope for a wide world's trust If, traitor by land and sea, You had let French lilies lie in the dust, Nor challenged for peace the war-lord's lust And struck for a Europe free. Fight and in hope, for battle is banned, The world shall yet rejoice, For the peoples rise in wrath to demand Henceforth no wars shall trouble the land Except at a people's voice. NIGHT AND MORNING August 3rdâ4th I heard the wakeful city's cries and cheers, The noise of armies tramping thro' the night, Clamour at wharves and dockyards all alight; I dreamed of wounds and faces pale for tears, But with the morning vanished all my fears So resolute above Helvellyn's height Rose the great sun, so calmly and so bright The mountains shone, so tranquil lay the meres. Thanks be to God! I cried, whose peace divine Is as the strong foundation of the hills, Whose mind as tranquil as yon water lies, Who gives the morning's calm to calm our wills And bids us to the mountains lift our eyes To find compassionate Nature's anodyne. TO THE KAISER When in that hour of grief and queenlessness You, on your charger white as driven snow, Shared in a mourning nation's grief and woe There was no voice but did the Kaiser bless; To-day in Armageddon's sore distress We know you better, for at last you show The tyrant undisguised, we count you foe Both to ourselves and to God's righteousness. Your hand it was that careless of all ill Unsheathed the sword to drench a world in blood, Your heart it was that in its terrible lust Would trample treaties to dishonoured dust And hack your way to Empire; but God still Reigns, and God's words are Peace and Brotherhood. A BATTLE CALL Britons, be staunch and true, Remember Waterloo, See this great peril through For God and peoples. Our prayers ascend on high That Heaven grant victory, Bells hang impatiently In all our steeples. Tho' ne'er a battle-day Dawn with such grim array, Brute strength shall not dismay, Greater your skill is, Nobler your cause, more just Than his whose battle-lust Threatens to lay in dust The fair French lilies. Let not Meuse feel affright That she be red ere night, Not for to-day ye fight But for to-morrow. Centuries hence shall tell No English gallant fell But to save earth from hell And war's great sorrow. Nor let the cornland heed Trampling, from better seed Where British heroes bleed Shall fruit be waving. Seed of true liberty, Fruit of a Europe free From iron tyranny And despot's raving. Not earth and heaven alone Gaze on you. From His throne God, whose good will is done By dead or living, Looks, and in wondrous love Welcomes to worlds above All who undaunted move To their life's giving. Courage! I hear a voice, Battle was not your choice But as ye fight rejoice, Europe's befrienders. War has been borne too long To magnify the strong, Now is the end of wrongâ Ye are the enders. THE NEW EVANGELISTS Ever they bade us drink unto the Day, âThe day ordained of Heaven that should surprise Britain unmasked of her hypocrisies âA sham Colossus with its feet of clay, Britain the posturing Titan in decay, Britain made strong by her world robberies, Britain made weak by wealth and luxuries, Britain no more to bar the Teuton's way. And as they taught us, lo! before our view They brought from far the heroes of the sword And kindled in our hearts their warrior fire; Might, that was right, to conquer and subdueâ The one soul-cleansing passion and desire, They never taught us men should keep their word. âYOUR COUNTRY NEEDS YOUâCOME!â With throb and beat along the street I hear the roll of drum, And throb and beat one word repeat, âYour country needs youâCome!â For now or never is the day to stem the foe-men's tide, So join the fray, 'tis death to stay, decide, decide, decide. Come forth from cottage and from hall, and forward to the fight, For better far to fight and fall than lift no hand for right. Leave plough and spade, leave loom and trade, the Huns are at the gate, Now is the time your King to aid, to-morrow is too late, Now is the time to do and dareâwho would not rather go With hearts of heroes free as air, than forced against the foe? Roll drums and beat, your call repeat, for Freedom and for Home, Down every street I hear brave feet make answer, âLo, we come!â THE CHILD AND THE WAR With trident in her hand and helm on head Enthroned Britannia called, and thereupon The Empire brought her offerings; College don, Master of school, to her their young men led, Far lands sent corn that armies might be fed, The rich brought gold, the mother gave her son, The maiden brought the lover she had won, The bride her gallant husband newly-wed, Brave warriors bore their swords for offering, These passed, and on the great throne's golden stairs Stood lone and unabashed a little child; âMother of all,â she cried, âmy daily prayers Are all the help for war that I can bring,â And the great queen put forth a hand and smiled. A CALL TO ARMS From the fell and from the valley, Men of Cumbria, rally! rally! Fathers praise your sons for zest, Mothers give us of your best, Tho' your hearts be full of tears Smile and join us in our cheers. Hark! to man the empire's wall Duty, love, and honour call, All that ever made us great Bids us rise to serve the State. Therefore from the fell and valley, Men of Cumbria, rally! rally! British heroes who have given Life, are blessing you from Heaven, All the prayers that we can pray Arm you for the battle-fray. God provides you sure alliesâ Right and pure self-sacrifice, With the hope one day to see Europe peaceful, Europe free. SUNSHINE AND WAR I wandering by the tranquil northern sea Beneath blue sky and bathed in sunny air Thanked God that He had made a world so fair The soul's embodiment of peace to be. Then sudden all the light was dark to me I heard the guns, the cries of fierce despair, The grey town towers crashed down and I was 'ware Of helpless corpses floating down the Dee. Earth, sea and sky, what mockeries ye are, To cheat me thus with semblances of calm; Then a voice answered âLo! my hands have given The tranquil sea, the happy sunlit heaven, To soothe all hearts with momentary balm And stanch the wounds that bleed for woe and war.â THE MINISTRY OF THE HILLS Lend me your calm, ye mountains, and your peace, Ye valley meres where Peace in beauty dwells, Here are no forts, but God hath citadels Beneath whose shelter all our troubles cease, Here where unjealous singers make increase Of heather-harvest for their friendly cells, Where the unwarlike shepherd stands and tells From yonder crag each happy wandering fleece. Ye Cumbrian fells what ministry is yours To soothe a nation's war-distracted breast; Long since has passed your passion's fire and heat, Now on Helvellyn's height the angels' feet Bring Heavenly peace, and ancient Skiddaw stores Within his heart inviolable rest. A TRUMPET CALL He who hears not now the call âCall of sacrifice and all Duty that can keep us brave, Let him find a coward's grave! He who hears it in that hour Feels endued with spirit power, Death is life, the grave is past, He is risen with Christ at last. All that ever made us great, All the present big with fate, All the future that shall be Filled with love and liberty Call, âArise in honour's might, Help the weak, defend the right, Not alone our seagirt walls But a world that needs you, calls.â ON SAINT OSWALD'S DAY August 5th Beneath the Cross of Christ the Crucified The warriors knelt. âLord, save us and befriend, And from the Heaven of heavens Thy succour send Against the foeman's fierceness and his pride; For well Thou knowest the right is on our side, We enter war for no ignoble end The safety of our nation to defend, Lord, help and save usââso King Oswald cried. We kneeling plead on this Saint Oswald's Day For help against a fierce and haughty foe, Our cause is just, we have not drawn the sword For selfish endsâThou in Thy Heaven dost know Not for the spoil of victory we pray, But for the peace of all Thy peoples, Lord. Note.âIt is said that on the night before the Battle of Heavenfield, 635 A.D., King Oswald having with his own hands helped to erect a wooden cross in sight of his warriors, cried to them, âLet us all kneel down and beseech the living God to defend us from a haughty and fierce enemy, for He knows that we have undertaken a just war for the safety of our nation.â MOUNTAIN CALM AND MAN'S UNREST Silent they stand these calm encircling hills And very quietly the day declines, But yonder 'mid the cornland and the vines The cannon-thunder shakes the air and fills The affrighted heaven. Man his brother kills, While the vast slaughter earth incarnadines And flushes all the streams where lines on lines Move on to death, war slaves against their wills. How still the lake sleeps now beneath the stars! The shepherd in his cottage on the fells Shuts to his door and weary seeks repose, But all night long he hears the tramp of foes, The roar of cannon, and the scream of shells, And feels in dream the agony of wars. A MARCHING SONG Let us march singing, men, God and the right with us, Peace for the peoples our goal and our star, Heaven's cheers are ringing, men, prayers at home fight with us, Angels unseen of us help in the war. Mind ye not Waterloo, Quatrebras and Malplaquet, Odds were against us then, victory was ours, What they dared we can do, greater the need to-day, All the world's hope for us helps and empowers. Hark! how the battle-call wakens response from far, How the young lion brood roars over sea, Whether we stand or fall one in our hate of war But one in warfare that Europe be free. We nurse no rivalry, we ask no wider walls, Claim no possessions and seek not for gold, But for our chivalry all that has made us calls, Honour's the city we built and must hold. Hell's at the gates of it, God is our citadel, Brotherhood, faith, our munition and stores, All the world waits for it, peace or the doom of hell, Others shall reap, be the brave sowing yours. THE LAD WHO RAN FROM HOME We laid him gently on the grass, We knew that he must die, He watched the painless clouds go pass Across the peaceful sky. The clouds that he had seen so oft Sail white above the village croft. âAnd have you any word to send,â I said, âto friends at home?â And ere my sentence found an end I saw the great tears come. âFather and mother do not know I came to France to fight the foe. To serve my Country and my King, To share a soldier's life I left my home and everything That is most dear to life, My comrades of the country side, My mother's love, my father's pride. My end is near but I am glad, To fight for right I came, Tell them at least their soldier lad Died brave for honour's name, I know I ran from home, but say From foe I never ran away.â TO THE GALLANT GUNNERS OF LIÃGE Cooped in their iron cupolas that flare Fierce wrath upon th'unhesitating foe, One thing alone the Belgian gunners knowâ Duty, for one thing only greatly care From homes defenceless else and in despair To ward th'invaders devastating woe, To hurl defiance fiery blow on blow At those who recked not how for right men dare. And still from out their towers of Death and Hell Deafened for life, their duty's call they hear, Sons of the bravest tribe who fought with Rome; The BelgÃ¦ were held by CÃ¦sar to be the bravest of the tribes of Gaul. They were the first to throw off the Roman yoke. Still do they speed their crashing shot and shell, While round the world reverberates a cheer For those who fight for honour and for home. IN A CHURCHYARD AT LIÃGE Last month my wife and infant died, I bore them to their rest, A voice for consolation cried, âBelieve God's will is best.â I turned to curse the voice that said âTo this bereavement bow, Bring full submission to thine aid,â I could not curse it now. For I have seen the Meuse run red, The forts flame fires of hell, Dark wings hurl death from overhead, The flight of shot and shell. Have seen young women by the hair Dragged forth to meet their fate, Because they dared what all must dare When foes are at the gate. Have watched from villages asmoke The harmless people fly, The faces of those frightened folk Will haunt me till I die. Therefore, dear wife, I cannot weep That you have gone away, The guns may thunder but you sleep In LiÃ¨ge churchyard to-day. TO GENERAL LEMAN The Defender of LiÃ¨ge When guns are hushed and wounds shall cease to bleed And dauntless Belgians build their homes again, One name shall make us all forget our pain For praise of your imperishable deed; Your hand it was at Europe's utmost need Held back the flood of death and bade France gain Those precious moments, while your fortress rain Fell as you sowed by Meuse death's murderous seed. Limbs crushed, from fort to fort you sped each day Hurling defiance till the ponderous shell Crashed and the conqueror 'neath the ruins found You and your men in swoon upon the ground, You woke and they who listened heard you say âSay that unconscious with the fort I fell.â TO THE OFFICER IN COMMAND AT AERSCHOTT When like an evil dream this thing shall fade And your unspeakable atrocious crime Shall find oblivion in the floods of time, One name shall still find memory has repaid In more than full the debt upon it laid âThe debt of Europe's loathing. Prison lime Eats up the murderer's body, prose and rhyme Shall keep embalmed the butcheries you made, For you rained bullets on defenceless folk And swore those bullets had been rained on you, So gave to flames and loot a helpless town, All customary laws of war you broke, Outraged our women, shot civilians down, And only left us bitter ash to rue. THE MARTYRDOM OF FATHER DERGENT, AERSCHOTT When those rude Roman soldiers set at naught The Christ and bruised and nailed Him to the Tree, Did He not pray they might forgiven be Because they knew not of the sin they wrought; But these have known, by centuries of thought Have learned compassion holds the master key To God's high hope for poor humanity And love's redemption by the Gospel taught. And still we pray forgive the coward crew Who bound the gentle pastor foot and hand And mocked and tortured in the Aerschott street; Heroâwho bathed in blood from head to feet Could never disallow the truth he knew And martyr died for faith and fatherland. Note.âParticulars of the cruel doing to death of Father Dergent at Aerschott were published in The Tablet by an eye-witness. After most disgusting and cruel entreatment by brutal soldiery for the space of three hours, bound hand and foot with copper wire, made to stand on tiptoe with hands held above his head and so beaten that the blood dropped down on to his bare feet, Father Dergent was offered release from the torture on two conditions, one that he should abjure his faith as a Catholic, the other that he should cry âGermany for ever.â He indignantly refused, was taken away and shot and stripped. His naked body was afterwards found in the river. âThe Times, February 24th. OFF TO THE WAR There is never a drum to be heard, No banners are waved in the wind, But the heart of the village is stirred, The city has made up its mind. Brave lads with the promise of years Have sworn they will march on the foe, The mothers are hiding their tears, The fathers cheer as they go. The children must tie up the wheat, The women must harness the car, Hark! hark! to the hurrying feet, They are off to the harvest of war. Shall they reap who sow in that field? What matter, they cast good seed, With peace for the world as its yield, With glory for help at our need. They are off, and they have no fear, They will break the tyrant's rod, The drums whose roll they hear Are the drums of the judgment of God. LOUVAIN August 25th Nothing can wipe away this dastard stain And unforgiveable as unforgot; Kaiser! on your dark battle shield this blot A darker blot for ever shall remain; Religion, books, carved stone, and storied pane Pleaded as vainly as the men you shot, Wherefore our indignation burns red-hot Above the fiery ashes of Louvain. And when at last ambition's bubble burst, Your mighty nation, honoured by the world âFor all its work of philosophic fame âFor all it did in learning's sacred name Lies prostrate, every lip shall then be curled To hiss a second Attila's deed accursed. WHAT'S IN A NAME? What's in a name? I know not, but I know How round a name associations cling, How a great name will like a trumpet ring To send our sons full-hearted on the foe; Grey, Howard, Cecil, Gordon, how they glow With thought of some rememberable thing, How from such names of rock a living spring Of honourable deeds will ever flow. Mannteufel! nought your butchery can atone, Where art and age-long letters passed in flame, And fair Louvain to-day in ruin stands Black witness to your later learning's hands; But for your crime not you we blame alone, You bear your sire's hereditary name. A CUMBERLAND WAR SONG Sons of the Viking men, Norse mothers bore us, War to their liking, men, Now is before us. Wakened from slumber-land, Lo! we fear no man, But march for Cumberland Straight on the foeman. Fellsider, borderer, Hearken the far cry, âRight is your orderer, Honour your war-cry.â Many shall join the fray, Few back be coming, But though our bodies stay, Souls will be homing. Home! Ah! that word of might, Hearken his holloa, John Peel, where'er we fight, Still will we follow. Love of our hills and dales Fast shall enfold us; Pray, friends! for prayer avails, That God uphold us. THE DAY OF INTERCESSION Prayer and the Sun's Eclipse August 21st To Thee, the God of Battles, do we cry, While in this doubt and darkness we await The closing of the cannon's loud debate, Where thousands meet to conquer or to die; Great are the issuesâfreedom, slavery, Spirit or force, a Europe consecrate To peace or sworn to warfare, love or hateâ Love in the dust or hate enthroned on high. The people prayed, and ever from the lips Of those fierce servants on the field of pain Their loud Amens with punctuation rose; Then sudden glorious for his travailing throes, The great sun wheeled from darkness and eclipse, The earth was glad, God's purposes were plain. A HYMN IN TIME OF WAR Lord God of Hosts Whose purpose sure Stands firm above our mortal strife, Whose will for ever shall endure For Brotherhood, for Love, and Life; Helpless without Thy help, we pray, âEmpower us in this battle-day.â Within Thy hands the nations are, By Thee they wane, by Thee increase, Thou scourgest with the rod of War, Thou healest with the wand of Peace; Reborn in this dark hour of pain Renew our strength of soul again. O God, forgive our sins of ease, And ere this battle-day be done May all the nations on their knees Confess that Thou art God alone; Show us that love not hate is might, And crown, O Lord, the cause of Right. Amen. Note.âThe music for this hymn, written by Dr. Walford Davies, can be obtained from Sidney Riorden, 12 Noel Street, Soho. A VESPER HYMN Shield, O Lord, our best and bravest In their agony and strife, Who for friends, as once Thou gavest, Give their life. Only on the right relying Dare we to the Father pray, Guide them, guard them, and in dying Be their stay. Heaven's great law shall stand for ever, Hate must wane and love increase, Lord, beyond this battle fever Send us peace. A REVERIE August 23rd Here in my garden where the roses blow And sound of doves comes softly from the limes, While thro' the leafy veil the church clock chimes To tell me how the honeyed moments go, I cannot rest, for thought of all the woe This worst of hate's inexpiable crimes That ever plagued with war our later times, And loosed Hell's gate to let the bale-flood flow. The very sunlight mocks my heart to-day, The very silence seems to add to pain, For who am I that I should walk in peace And watch unscathed the people pass to pray, Whilst there the cannon's thunder cannot cease, And gallants face for me death's pitiless rain. TO THE HEROES OF MONS August 23rd Britain! fear no toll of death, They who gave their latest breath Died that we their friends might live, Died to teach us how to give; Ne'er forgotten tho' they lie Underneath an alien sky, Lo! their spirits from the grave Rise, to bid us all be brave, Rise and bid us one and all Now respond to Duty's callâ Call to take a warrior's place For the sake of home and raceâ Call to keep our Europe free From the War-Lord's tyranny, From the fierce unbridled course Of the lust of power and forceâ Call to strive that right not might Be the issue of the fight, With the flags of battle furled For the peace of all the world. Peace is yours, from out your dust Blossoms love of what is just, Indignation deep for wrong, Help for weak against the strong, Will to hold the plighted word Dearer than the might of sword. Strength as ye have given to give Life, that brotherhood may live, Hope that one day war shall end And all man with man be friend. Heroes tho' at rest ye lie Underneath an alien sky Grateful, tender, as the earth Of the land that gave you birth Is the covering of your graveâ You who died your land to saveâ You who proved the Empire still Breeds us men of hero will. Men who shed their blood to be Sacrifice for Liberty. HELP FROM THE STARS August 27th With that vast cannonading in mine ears, For fancy brought its thunder over sea, I wandered forth what time the galaxy Streamed like a cloud o'er mountains and o'er meres, What time the burning jewel without peers, Jove's planet, moved in peace and majesty; I felt the quiet of Heaven sink into me The calm and silence of those moving spheres. Heart-weary of interminable wars Look up, ye nations, God in Heaven above Night after night has wondrously unrolled His book of peace in letters of pure gold, And from His vast confederacy of stars Proclaims to all the world His law is love. THE MASSACRES IN THE PROVINCE OF NAMUR With fire and rape and loot, in Culture's name All use of international war ye broke; Made women watch the murder of men-folk And drank success to all your bloody game In foaming tankards; bade the maxims flame On innocent crowds because your rifles spoke Too slow, while butchers with the pole-axe stroke Wrought on defenceless burghers death and shame. The ravening sons of Thor and Odin's brood Fought, but with equals, the inglorious Hun Compassioned childhood, spared decrepit age, But sons of Culture this your wild-beast rage The world shall curse as long as bathed in blood The sunset heavens retell your set of sun. Note.âThe massacres and sack of Tamines, Andennes, Dinant, HastiÃ¨res and Surice, as vouched for by the eleventh report of the Belgian Commission of Inquiry, are a blot upon the shield of German culture that can never be wiped out. âCf. The Times, February 18th, 1915. TO THE HEROES OF THE NORTHERN SEA We sleep, but ye awake that we may sleep, There by your guns each gallant-hearted tar You out-watch sun and greet the morning star, Where the leviathans in prison keep Their pent-up hate, where foeman craft outcreep Beneath the wave to launch their bolts from far, While charged with death swift wings and giant car Hover above you as they seaward sweep. Watch on, ye sleepless heroes, great our need, Greater our thanks, bold breakers of a yoke That Nelson broke to set all Europe free; True sons of that unconquerable seed Who watched at Cadiz till the morn awoke Which gave our England empire of the sea. IN PRAISE OF SUBMARINE E 4 August 27th âBoat away!â the Captain cried, And we men of the Defender With our whale-boat went to render Our help to sailors leaping from their sinking vessel's side. It was little thanks they gave For the foeman bullets sent, But we stuck to our intent And we hauled the drowning seamen from the ravin of the wave. Then our ship her signal made âWe are standing out to sea, For we cannot fight with three, Steer for land and keep your hearts up, we will strive to send you aid.â There were foes to left and right, But our coxswain gave command And we steered toward the land, Knowing well that if we reached it we were prisoners in the Bight. We had fought from break of day, We were hungry and heart-sore, But we silent plied the oar, For the fortress-isle of Helgo that was twenty miles away. Then with swirl as of a whale Sudden close beside us rose A saviour from our foes, And the conning-tower opened, and we heard a British hail! Down her throat did each man leap Till with belly-full well crammed And with iron jaws tight-slammed The fish that had devoured us went down into the deep. Two hundred miles and more Did the whale God's mercy gave Fin its way beneath the wave, Till it landed us, the castaways, upon our native shore, And all the Fleet sang praises of Submarine E 4. THE LIST OF CASUALTIES Darkness in broken home and broken heart! Did we not rise and curse the Kaiser's name Who, doomed for ever to dishonour's shame, Dooms Britain thus in grief to bear her part And agonize in blood. Our tears would start But that our souls are filled with righteous flame To think that culture to such purpose came, And God-given science taught war's utmost art. Then like the sound of some far evening bell Calling our souls unto the peace of God, I heard from Heaven a mighty choral voice Crying âWe gladly fought and gladly fell To break for evermore the tyrant's rod And bid war-weary Europe's heart rejoice.â THE BATTLE OF THE BIGHT August 28th Oh! long long seemed the night and cheerless broke the day, When we ventured in to âscoopâ them thro' the mines and thro' the mist, There in Heligoland Bight for our Country and our King, âThe Liberty, the Fearless, the Laertes, Amethyst, And the saucy Arethusa led the way. Very stealthily we crept and we slipped into their ring Tho' we found the German cruisers and destroyers wide awake, For those wingÃ©d eyes in Heaven brought their fleet and fortress word; So we turned and faced the foe for our King and country's sake, And the battle bolts around us seemed to sing. But we lured them out to sea by the mercy of the Lord, Ere the fortress guns could find us for the mist and for the cloud, Then we settled to our task with a hearty British will, Ships to left and ships to right fighting fiercely in a crowdâ While our good six-pounders rumbled and the foe their fury poured. Very gallantly they fought us and we gave them pill for pill, Sank two cruisers, sent a third in flames for Davy Jones or home, Lowered boats, tho' Hell was round us all, their drowning crews to save, Then we signalled to the battleships âIt's hot, make haste and come,â And they came and Ariadne had her fill. We are bringing home the wounded, and to carry to their grave The noblest young commanders ever born to fight at sea; Brave Bartelott and Westmacott your names shall never die! Where's the man who when a four-inch shell takes leg above the knee Grips the rail and still gives orders? He's the man to rule the wave, He's the man for King and Country and for me. TO THE 9TH LANCERS With the Nation's thanks and honour August 31st Melinite, lyddite shells bursting around you, You the deliverers of France from the Huns, Ah! but you found themâthose gunners who found you, Sabred the servers and spiked all the guns. Then from the haystacks that never more thundered, Back thro' the Hell-storm and shell-storm you came âCame but behind left a deathless three hundred âCame but have won for all ages a name. Still Balaclava is sung of in story, Still our hearts beat for the deathless Brigade, Long as their charge is remembered with glory, Britain shall honour the charge that you made. TO CAPTAIN F. C. GRENFELL 9TH LANCERS Le Cateau, August 31st, 1914 Fingers shot off and both limbs wounded sore, Firmly you sat your saddle drenched with blood, You saw the gunners fallâthree men of four, Saw where the horses still in cover stood. But ere you swooned âWe'll save the guns!â you cried, âHarness the horses, limber up and go!â And careless if you lived or if you died, You bore the guns in safety from the foe. GOD SAVE THE KING! House of Commons, Friday, September 18th, 1914 âSirs, for a worthy purpose do we fight, Nor till we gain it can we sheathe the sword,â So to his Commons spake our Sovereign lord; Straight to their hearts his speech took arrow-flight, Then foes were friends, and in the dark was light, And sudden at the ending of his word From loyal throats was lustily outpoured The nation's hymn which gives us back our might. âSend him victorious!ââLondon's millions heard, âSend him victorious!ââThames took up the tone And bore its strains to an exultant sea; The world in arms caught echoes and was stirr'd By that sure promise of far good to be âAn empire's will magnificently one. IN HONOUR OF BATTERY L How the Guns were saved at Nery September 1st It was grey of the morn and we little wist That the ridge above was held by the foe, For heavy upon us lay the mist As we limbered up and were ready to go. Then the clock of the Nery Church struck five, The mist unveiled our Battery L And sudden the hill was all alive With thunder of gun and scream of shell. We were caught, our teams were horsed to the guns, What could we do in face of death? But remember we all were Briton's sons, To give for the cause our latest breath. To the enemy's twelve we were but six, And ere we unlimbered and swung them round We knew that our guns were in parlous fix For three of the teams were dead on the ground. But still we answered them, flame to flame Steady and sure as on parade, O, deadly straight was the German aim, And straight for death was our answer made. And close in the rear by a stack of hay, To which our wounded for shelter crept, Was Lamb and his maxim Captain Cameron Lamb, 2nd Battalion Border Regiment, whose maxim helped to silence the enemy's guns on this occasion, has received the D.S.O. for repeated gallantry. pounding away, Till one to one of our guns was left. Drivers and gunners laid in a ring, âStick it, brave lads,â our Captain cried. We three already had felt shell-sting, And were bleeding sore when the Captain died. But âstick itâ we did, for a brave man's sake, For the R.H.A. and Battery L, One gun to gun did we answer make Till we closed the breach on our only shell. Then sudden, as if it had had its fill, The last of their twelve with death had done, And silence fell on the ridge of the hill, The Middlesex cheered, and the field was won. HOW GEORGE WILSON WON THE VICTORIA CROSS Verneuil, September 14th, 1914 I heard the news in Prince's Street, I heard it on the Castle stair, It sped along with hurrying feet, It rang upon the evening air. The news how Wilsonâhe who sold Such papers as each urchin criedâ Had won the cross our heroes hold The British soldier's greatest pride. WILSON'S STORY The maxim sputtered from the wood, Our men were mad for rage and pain, So many came back drench'd with blood So many more were slain. That night we swore a comrade's oath, To-morrow ere the rise of sun If death, God save us! spared us both We'd take that maxim gun. Before the trenches were awake, Or ere the dawn was flushed to grey, With hearts made strong for Britain's sake We sped our perilous way. We found a sentry fast asleep, Death fell so swift he could not know, Thence on thro' corn that none will reap We stole toward the foe. From tree to tree we crossed the dell, Now crept, now stood like any stone, A bullet sang, my comrade fell, And I was left alone. Yet never beat my heart more brave, A spirit whispered in mine ear, âWho loses life his life shall save, Go forward, have no fear.â I heard the maxim's rattling crack, I prayed, I took deliberate aim, I shot their captain thro' the back And stopped his bloody game. Six men leapt up, stock-still I stood, They saw me not, the leaves were green, Their souls went forth into the wood With scarce a breath between. Then swift as any deer I ran, I saw no dead men in my haste, I shouldered gun and cartridge can, Then back for home I raced. And how that cruel weight I bore, And how I came in safety through I cannot guess, I know no more Than this I tell to you. But this I know that all the way I saw my sister's face of joy, And heard the proud âAuld Reekieâ say, âGod bless our Scottish boy.â Note.âPrivate George Wilson of the 2nd Battalion Highland Light Infantry won the Victoria Cross for conspicuous gallantry in locating and attacking a hostile machine gun near Verneuil, September 14th, accompanied by only one man, a private of the 50th Kings' Rifles. They went out alone and managed to get quite close to the enemy's position when Wilson's companion was killed. Undaunted, however, Wilson continued on his perilous mission. One by one he shot an officer and the entire gun team of six soldiers, and then ran in and took possession of the gun and two and a half cases of ammunition. Wilson was formerly a newsboy in Edinburgh, and sold The Evening Dispatch. He comes of a fighting family, and lived in the Lawnmarket, and his sister, Mrs. Devlin, still lives in Edinburgh. RHEIMS CATHEDRAL September 20th Rose of all great rose-windows most divine! No more on hearts that worship shall you shower Your rainbow glories at the sunset hour, No more shall Clovis, first o' the Frankish line, Witness for Christ with pure baptismal sign Here where the kings kept watch beneath their tower, And where the Maid, who brought a throne for dower, Saw her liege-lord anointed in this shrine. But from the fair cathedral's ash will rise Ever a cry of shame upon the Huns For such wide-world's irreparable loss, And louder than the thunder-roll of guns Shall Europe curse the vile barbarities Of Berserk rage whose fury broke the Cross. CAPTAIN MARK HAGGARD September 14th âStick it, Welsh!â the captain cried, Life's a bubble, Death will prick it, But the Welshman's pluck and pride Not since Harlech days have died, âStick it, Welshmen, stick it!â And we stuck it to the end. With a captain loved so dear Who could ever fail to stick it? Where he led was never fear, Where he came was ever cheerâ Cheer on march, in trench and picket, More than captainâcomrade, friend. Note.âCaptain Mark Haggard of the 2nd Welsh Regiment was mortally wounded while charging a German maxim at the Battle of the Aisne, after he had killed several of the soldiers serving the gun. From the testimony of men in his regiment it would appear that he made this desperate attack in face of a terrible fire, because he thought that if it were attempted by his company the loss would be too heavy. Two of the three men who accompanied him fell, but the third, Corporal Fuller, who carried him back, was awarded the V.C. Captain Haggard's dying cry of âStick it, Welsh,â has become famous. A NAMELESS HERO OF THE LANCASHIRE FUSILIERS Lancashire Fusiliers, Hark to my tale, For all the flood of years It shall not fail. The man who did this thing Lord of his fate, Did more than serve his king, Made Britain great. Ringed by two hundred foes Prone on the ground, He dealt unerring blows To all around. Then his last bullet spent Death standing by, No word of yielding sent Resolved to die. Rose for his country's sake, Crossed arms on breast, A hundred rifles spake, His soul had rest. Note.âA German prisoner told the story of how a man of the Lancashire Fusiliers who had been cut off refused to surrender. In the face of 200 Germans against him, he lay down and blazed away till he had no more cartridges left, then, having lost his bayonet, he stood up, folded his arms and died riddled with bullets. But before he died he had accounted for two score of the enemy. THE SORROW OF THE NORTHERN SEA September 22nd Hark to the moaning of the Northern sea With lamentation for th' heroic dead! For whom the bolt invisible was sped That bade them of their tireless task be free. Sleep well! not unremembered shall ye be; We dwelt secure, we slumbered without dread, Our farms were tilled, and all the land had bread Because ye watchedâand dying was your fee. No more the tide an uncompassionate thing Shall sway beneath the channel's silver wall, No winds shall pass unsorrowfully by, Still o'er their grave the ships that go shall call âHailâ to the gallant dead who cannot die, Sea-sentinels for Empire and for King. Note.âThe British cruisers, Aboukir, Hogue, and Cressy were sunk by German submarine, September 22nd, 1914. THE BRIDGE-BREAKERS âThat bridge at all costs must be broken,â Were the words that the General said, We felt ere the words were half spoken We would break the bridge, living or dead. It was racing with death, but we raced it With speed Royal Engineers use, They ran with a charge and they placed it, All dead ere they lighted the fuse. To the bridge-head we saw the foe surging A grey multitudinous host, Not a heart but heard Duty's stern urging, Fire fuse, or the bridge will be lost. Then one looked in the face of his brother, Maxims muttered and rifles outrang, âIf I fall, if I fail, let another Come after,â and forward he sprang. He fell; with magnificent daring Ten others the task did essay, Their souls into glory are faring, Their bodies a sacrifice stay. But fearless thro' bullet-storm flying One still the adventure will dare, He died but he smiled in his dying For he heard the bridge roar into air. Note.âThe French and English had retreated across the Aisne at Soissons. The bridge had to be blown up at all costs, the whole place was an inferno of maxim and rifle fire. A party of Royal Engineers dashed towards the bridge, laid a charge to destroy it, but before they could light the fuse were all killed. Eleven men single-handed tried to light the fuse, but all met the same fate. A twelfth man, running over the bodies of his brothers, succeeded and sent the bridge up with a roar as he also fell dead. A MODERN HORATIUS A handful at the bridge of Aisne Against a host we dauntless stood, We swore till every man was slain To stem the German flood. One after one upon the bridge We fell around our maxim gun, Still down the road from wood and ridge Poured on the grey-coat Hun. Then suddenly a Highland man Pressed thro' his fellows on the shore, Straight to the silent maxim ran And gun and tripod bore; Bore it as fast as feet could go, Placed it and with a single hand Poured such lead torrents on the foe As brought them to a stand. Each time the sputtering maxim spoke The grey-coats down like grass were mown, The column paused, then wavering broke, The bridge was still our own. God knows how in the bullet hail He fired his volleys round on round, And still with aim that did not fail The gallant held his ground. Till reinforced, with cheer and yell We crossed the river, rushed the ridge, When pierced by thirty bullets fell The man who kept the bridge. Ah! many deeds were done that day, But braver never sure was done Than his who kept the foe at bay Against a thousand one. Still do they praise in Roman song How Cocles fought and died of old, Let this Horatius live as long, His deed as long be told. IN HONOUR OF LIEUTENANT-COMMANDER H. DE P. RENNICK Formerly of the Antarctic ship âTerra Nova,â who perished in the sinking of the âHogueâ in the North Sea, September 22nd There in the long intolerable night Where the Antarctic blizzards thundering came, Your brave heart nursed indomitable flame To keep the darkness cheerful, warm, and bright, And still on Northern waters pours its light Where the fierce bolt invisible wrought us shame, For you have left imperishable name To lead men's souls to victory in the fight. Whelmed in that swirling agony of death All saviour flotsam you refused to keep, Plank after plank to drowning men you gave, Others you saved, yourself you could not save, Cheered on your comrades with your latest breath, Then sank to glory thro' the pitiless deep. Note.âRennick was a strong swimmer. He gave up a plank which had come his way to a man who could not swim. He found other planks but refused to avail himself of their support, and towed them through the bitter sea that he might save seamen who were struggling in the water. Four times he accomplished this act of self-sacrifice, then his strength failed him and the hero sank to death. âT.P.'s Journal of Great Deeds, January 16th. IN FACE OF DEATH September 25th When the mute figure all of us await Stands as a friend to beckon us away, We bow the head, we have no word to say; But you, heroic masters of your fate, You met and questioned him with stern debate, Looked in his face, and patient dared essay Your perilous venture, striving to unweigh With desperate skill that sunken bomb of hate. Dauntless ye toiled, with delicate hands and wise A single tilt o' the balance and lo! the mine Had blown your craft and crew to dust and death, But still you laboured on with bated breath And proved the metal of your sailor-line To face all dread afloat with open eyes. Note.âOn the 25th September, Submarine E 6, while diving, fouled the moorings of a mine, laid by the enemy. On rising to the surface, she weighed the mine and sinker: the former was securely fixed between the hydroplane and its guard. The weight of the sinker made it a difficult and dangerous matter to lift the mine clear without exploding it. After half an hour's patient work this was effected by Lieut. F. A. P. Williams-Freeman and Able Seaman E. R. Cremer, and the released mine descended to its original depth. The Lieutenant was made a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order and the Able Seaman received a Distinguished Gallantry Medal. LOVE THE CONQUEROR High between Meuse and Marne I saw a throne, And on the throne unconquerable Death, Prostrate the thousand thousands lay beneath, And with a voice of winds and waves that moan They worshipped till the awful monotone Sank into silence; for their nostrils' breath Ceased, and Death cried, âThe world that worshippeth Power and great might, must worship me alone.â But by the throne I saw bright angels stand, Grim Death before their presence backward reeled, And Life rose up irrevocably king; The awful horror of the stricken field, The shame that love should be a conquered thing, By these peace triumphed, battle days were banned. INDIA'S GIFT Thanks to the gallant seven hundredâthe kings of the East, Rulers of nations and tribesmen in number as sand, Men who have felt the high call to the greatest and least That empire and honour shall standâ Rajput and Gurkha and Sikh and the warrior Pathan âSons of the hills and the plains who have longed for the day When, to seal a long pact that the rule of the righteous began, They should stand by our side in the fray; Treasure they bring us, they bring us the spear and the sword, Yea, but they give greater giftsâthey give union and might, âSworn that the nation which vows and dishonours its word Shall reel and sink back into night. MICHAELMAS DAY Grasmere, September 29th There was no war in Heaven, thro' cloudless blue All day above the hills the sun was rolled, Gleamed on the lakes, showered warmth on field and fold And searched the waning forest through and through. Came eventide, and lo! Heaven's wonder grew, For with such light as angels may behold Above dusk vales the mountains flamed to gold, Paled, and then flushed their glories to renew. But between Somme and Oise, by Meuse and Aisne, The Dragon great Saint Michael cast to earth Was filling all the world with noise of war, And I beneath the sunlit Rydal Scar Prayed God the ravenous dragon-brood be slain And peace, inviolate peace again have birth. TO LORD ROBERTS On his 82nd birthday, September 30th, 1914 Bobs!âso we love to call youâwhen the roll Of men who helped the Empire to the last Time-worn shall fade, your name will still stand fast, âYou whose clear eyes saw writ the fiery scroll Of Teuton rage to dominate earth whole, âYou who all years and ease behind you cast And with a young man's ardour unsurpast Strove to give Britain back her warrior soul. Wilderness prophet! in the days of sun You cried, and deaf we passed unheeding by, Now in the night of darkness and of pain With almost at our gates the desperate Hun, We thank and praise you for your prophet-cry, Our soul stands up, our manhood lives again. THE GUNNERS' FAREWELL âGood-bye, you fellows all; good-bye, good-bye!â And so the thirty gunners went to die; Thereafter thirty other gunners came To play the old heroic British game. Farewell! but long as thus ye go to death, Tho' we who gaze at distance hold our breath For wonder at your daring, who shall say Our Island's warrior soul has passed away? Kaiser! albeit contemptuously you speak And on our men your tyrant wrath should wreak, Did ever warriors face the fires of Hell With such light hearts, with such a proud farewell? A FRENCH MOTHER'S MESSAGE âNine sons I gave to fight the foe, One wore the Cross of Honour for brave deed, And though unstaunched a mother's heart will bleed To think of eight so suddenly laid low My blessing on the ninth I now bestow, Bid him keep well what was his brother's meed, For he who to such honour doth succeed A double duty to his land must owe.â Say not the race is decadent, the power That made so great the mothers of old Rome On Latin soil, immortally shall live As long as mothers thus their sons can give, And sons receive th' inestimable dower Of such a benediction straight from home. Note.âIn General Joffre's Orders of the Day, October 15th, mention was made of an heroic mother who had given nine sons to the fighting line, eight of whom were reported killed. One of these had won the Legion of Honour. A sister, writing from home in the mother's name, to this surviving brother, informed him that the brother's Legion of Honour had been handed to him to keep, and she added âMother bids you do your duty.â A PRISONER AT DUNNABECK Again the quiet grassy road I see By rock and fern down-sloping to the mere, Again with joy the Dunna-beck I hear Chanting its ancient song of liberty; The robin from the twilight in the tree Lets loose his careless carol far and near, While overhead the calm white moon doth steer And sunset's galleon-clouds of gold go free. But I am prisoner to dark sorrowful thought, And even in this most dear sequester'd spot I cannot wander to the fields of peace; All day I hear the scream of shell and shot, All night I dream what havoc war hath wrought Where league-long battles raging cannot cease. WHAT THE SERGEANT SAID We were five and the enemy twenty-five, âIt's the right proportion,â the Sergeant said, âSo hurry up lads, we must contrive To take the lot of them dead or alive, To take them alive or leave them dead.â So we went for cover in order free Then gave it them hot and they answered game; What chance can men have who shoot from the knee Against men with sights and men who can see Who allow for wind as they take their aim! One after another like ninepins fell Till now we were only five and five. âGood lads,â said the Sergeant, âyou're shooting well, If the marker were here what âbullsâ he would tell, We must take the lot of them dead or alive.â Then up went a handkerchief, what did we care! We had had too many by white flags shot, But they dropped their rifles, held hands in air, And we knew that they meant it fair and square, So we cheered, rushed in, and we bagged the lot. And some were wounded and some were dead, But coats and rifles can stretchers contrive, Then away we marched to our lines ahead; âIt's the right proportion,â the Sergeant said, âWhen five of us come upon twenty-five.â Note.âThis poem is founded on an exploit of Sergeant-Major Johnson, of the Army Service Corps, near the village of Nogent-l'Artaud, who with four men, one of them only armed with a stick, surprised and took captive a German officer and twenty-four men. TO MAX, BURGOMASTER OF BRUSSELS Lord of himself in days of storm or fine That man a city's fortress-tower we claim, Who careless of the people's praise or blame, Fearless of friend or foe doth well divine How in the darkness Duty best can shine; And such wert thou, who, when the fierce foe came, Unquailing held aloft the city's name, âThe bravest of the Burgomaster's line. Brow-beaten, menaced by an insolent host Did'st thou not scorn their ineffectual rage And give thy spirit to a trembling town, âCast in their tyrant teeth the burgher's gauge, Wear ever hope's indomitable crown, Face death all dayâtrue watchman at thy post? BELGIUM When I bethink me nations wax and wane, These like ripe fruit slow-cankered from inside, These falling swift from over-weaning pride That held the gentle heart in high disdain, This battered to its knees to rise again; One thing alone above the surging tide And flux of things seems surely to abide, âThe soul that doth invincible remain. To you, heroic Belgium, beaten down Because you trusted in a neighbour's word, Has come the terrible night, but comes the morn; Wasted with fire and bleeding from the sword Proudly you wear self-sacrifice for crown And find your soul immortally re-born. AN INCIDENT OF THE TRENCHES Between the trenches in the zone Of fire a wounded German lay; Of all his comrades there was none To bear him safe away. A derelict by foe and friend He groaned and waited for the end. Then out and spake our captain bold, âAlbeit no Teuton, lads, by birth, Against such human need I hold My life of little worth. If none will venture of his kin, I give my life to bear him in.â From trench he leapt, and crouched and ran, The foeman's bullets bit and stung, We saw him reach the dying man And o'er his shoulder flung; Then faint of blood and wounded sore, His burden to the foe he bore. His wounds most tenderly they dressed, They praised the hero face to face, The iron cross upon his breast They pinned with hands of grace. And back he stumbled in his pain, To win the British trench again. The Germans cheered, we Britons cheered, Deliberate he came and slow, But as once more our trench he neared, His case we all might know, Into our arms the Captain fell, Dead for the foeman served so well. CRUCIFIED BELGIUM When I beheld the lamentable woe That a brave peopleâchallenged thrice to yield, But thrice arisen indignantly to shield Their hearths and homesteads from a barbarous foeâ Have in the venture dared to undergo, Rather than let a treaty counter-sealed By neighbour nations be by force repealedâ A âscrap of paperâ wind-tossed to and fro; Then in the darkness 'neath a wrathful sky, While the earth quakes for cannon and the sword, I see a cross, and on that cross there hangs The body of a people in its pangs, And hear from far an agonising cry, âInto Thy handsâinto Thy hands, O Lord.â SISTER JULIE GerbÃ©villier All day, all night, unmitigable hate Upon the unprotected town was poured, The flames devoured, and hungry was the sword, But heedless of the foemen at the gate And sworn to duty's vow inviolate, One woman moved sweet comfort to afford, The dying saw an angel of the Lord Divinely calm, heroically great. Then spake the fierce invader, âHence! away! This is no place for women; get thee gone.â But fearless Sister Julie straight replied, âThe soldier at his post must needs abide, And till my convent Mother bids, alone To cheer and help the wounded here I stay.â ANTWERP October 9th Ever the Scheldt shall sob unto the main, Never from out of Antwerp's midnight sky Shall the red glare of conflagration die, Nor Belgian earth be wholly free of pain; But tho' no more shall fall the pitiless rain Of liquid fire, nor monstrous airships fly Fateful and charged with dread artillery, Though peace creep back unto her home again âThe world shall still remember here the strong Stamped on the weak, cast treaties to the wind Like scraps of paper, wreaked a baffled hate, Here crucified the past that made them great, And preaching war's redemption of mankind For culture wrought intolerable wrong. IN PRAISE OF HAVILDAR GANGA SINGH, V.C. Now thro' India let it ring Praise for Havildar Ganga Singh, He with his fifteen comrades tried, Who held the trench for the British side, Men who there in the jaws of Hell Made sixty ghosts ere to death they fell. Now thro' India let it ring Praise for Havildar Ganga Singh, Sound it aloud at Firozpur, Let Ganga tell, so his name endure, How at the rush of the German horde He slew their captain and seized the sword, Made such play with it, heavy and true, That ten of the foemen gat their due, Ere wounded in hands and breast and head, Havildar Singh was left for dead. Now thro' India let it ring Praise for Havildar Ganga Singh, First of the dark-faced soldiers seen To wear the cross of our Empress Queen. The Havildar and fifteen men were attacked in their trench before dawn. In the hand-to-hand struggle that ensued, he shot the German officer whose bullet grazed his head, took his sword from him, and killed ten more before, brought down by a bullet, he was left for dead. âOtherwise,â he said, âI should have killed moreâit was a heavy sword.â Ganga Singh, a Dogra, who had been awarded the Victoria Cross, was specially visited by the King and Queen, in the Royal Pavilion at Brighton, on Saturday, January 9th. AN INVITATION AND A REFUSAL Antwerp âCome back, come back, and let us dry your tears, Your pretty homes and gardensâwhy forsake them? Unlock your doors, or needs must we shall break them; We are not brutal English grenadiers, We are the knightly-hearted, without peers, Our manners Treitschke and Bernhardi make them, Our words are bonds, and all the nations take them. Come back, dear people, and forget your fears.â To whom replied the fugitives, âYour love Let Louvain speak, Aerschott, Malines, Tourmonde, Let women outraged, old men butchered tell; Rather in utter homelessness we dwell Than once again your tender culture prove, Housebreakers beâwho broke a nation's bond!â The fugitives from Antwerp were invited by the military authorities to return to the town. âIf you do not unlock your doors,â they say, âwe shall be obliged to break into your houses.â GENERAL JOFFRE As sometimes with a lever in his hand In midst of vast mechanics there is seen A man: he speaks not, but the huge machine Stirs into life to do what he has planned, Silent and self-controlled he takes command And rules in perfect mastery serene, While thousand wheels with none to intervene Roar at his will or at his pleasure stand. So dost thou seem, brave General, with the fate Of Europe on thy shoulders, silent, strong, Disdaining praise, and careless of all blame; A touch from thee, and lo! the armÃ©d throng Leaps into life, a touch, and lo! they wait, Willing to die, but not disgrace thy name. TO THE MEN OF H.M.S. âHAWKEâ October 17th Whether close-sealed within your iron tomb, Or faltering round our headlands with the tide, Deadâbut in love of her for whom you diedâ Sleep well! not unavenged ye met your doom; You heard not the Undaunted's cannon boom, When those âdestroyersâ perished in their pride, But 'twas for you their guns our seamen plied, For you and that wave-hidden murderous bomb. Lance! Loyal! Legion! Lennox! how the sun Shines, and the clouds of sorrowful darkness flee! For now we know that with the foe in sight Our gallant tars, when gun can speak to gun, Will prove their old unconquerable might And tell the world how Britain rules the sea. TO NAIK DARWAN SING NEGI, V.C. 1st Battalion 39th Garhwalis Naik Darwan Sing Negi! your tribe are the men Who know the wild upland where Dhingle Tal lies, Who track the red bear to his deep forest den And hunt the fierce tiger with flame in his eyes. The prince of shÃ­kÃ¡ris with blanket of brown You out-witted foxes, you stole on the deer, But now in the trenches far better you own Is sport with the rifle and bayonet spear. Bare-footed in dark to the trenches you crept, The rockets might flare and the bullets might sing, But you single-handed on twenty men leapt And fought like a tiger for home and for king. Naik Darwan Sing Negi! the brave Garhwalese Had never a braver to send to our need, When back you go, proudest of all the V.C.'s, Be sure that the Empire remembers your deed. IN TRAFALGAR SQUARE October 21st High-pillaredâarmlessâbut one hand on sword, With coastward gaze, great Admiral, here you stand, Pillar of safety to a sea-girt land, That, loyal still to your expectant word, Knows how the call of duty strikes a chord Which keeps us one in heart, and one in hand, Strong by obedience to its stern command To free all Europe from a tyrant lord. But never, since with double line you smote The crescent foe at wondering Trafalgar, Has your last message sounded out so clear To thrill an Empire with persuasive note, As now, when in the throes of terrible war, Nelson! we feel your guardian spirit near. IN MEMORIAM Major M. P. Buckle, D.S.O. October 27th Spirits there are made wholly pure and brave, Who pass, but out of distance where they be We hear their voices cryingââFollow me! Save not yourselves so others you may save! What tho' we lie in some forgotten grave, Grieve not! for death was but the masterkey That opened wide life's door, and set us free To give to many what to few we gave.â E'en so brave-hearted Bayard! sore beset By that fierce foe's impenetrable ring You passed, but still you lead the men of Kent; If self-forgetful, you could ne'er forget Your comrades' need, your country, and your king, Till called to higher service, forth you went. TO THE 4th BATTALION BORDER REGIMENT A Farewell Fare ye well, Borderer! God is your orderer, Under His mighty wings forth for the right; Crossfell to Walney Scar Send you good speed from far, Scafell, Helvellyn cry, âKeep your name bright!â Honourâfor this you go On a dishonoured foe, Yea, and for freedom as friend helpeth friend; Fierce fiends and lust of swine Shame not your marching line, True knight and gentleman fight to the end. Whether you stand or fall, Hark! to the empire's call, âDown with the war-lords, let tyranny cease!â Cumberland, Westmoreland, Reach you warm-hearted hand, Forward to victoryâvictory and peace. TO THE 4th BATTALION BORDER REGIMENT On their sailing for Burmah, October 29th You leave us, but your eyes will still behold The fox-red bracken on the sunny fell, Where'er you go, within your hearts will dwell A memory of the woods in autumn gold, Of mountains in their tawny splendour rolled Up to grey skies, of rocks where ravens dwell, Of lonely tarns and dark ghylls loved so well, Of chiming hounds and horn Peel knew of old. And though the wonder of an orient clime, Magic of Burmah's multitudinous swarm, The tropic forests with their tree-flowers gay May thrill your souls with wonder, still the charm Of home shall follow, follow far away Your souls will be in Cumbria all the time. KHUDADAD KHAN, V.C. Khudadad of the Baluchis, First of our Indian brave V.C.'s. You with a heart as fierce as your sun, You who saved us a British gun, You who taught us East was as West To serve the King-emperor's high behest, You when by blast of murderous shell Around like leaves your comrades fell, Bated no jot of your soul's desire To quench and stifle the enemy's fire, And all alone in face of a host Hero you stuck to a hero's post Till the foe ceased firing and in your ears For maxims' rattle were British cheers. How can we honour the heart of flame That won for India deathless name? Khudadad, when you seek again The little brown wife in the sun-brown plain, All the village will come to greet you, All the children will run to meet you, Proud of the cross on the sepoy's breast, The cross for valour that stood the test, The cross we give to our bravest and best. Khudadad of the Duke of Connaught's Own Baluchis was the first of the Indian contingent to win the Victoria Cross. On October 30th, at Holbecke in Belgium, he was in the the fighting line helping to work a maxim gun under an English officer. All the members of the gun-team were shot down, but he stuck to the gun till relief came and saved the situation. ALL SAINTS' DAY The Church bells called to worship on the day That still remembers Boniface and his deed Who to one God and to the Martyrs' seed Gave the Pantheon. As I knelt to pray Flocking from France and Belgium far away Came men whose wounds had scarcely ceased to bleed And each one bore a palmâthe victor's meed, And all were clad in stainless white array. âWeep not,â they cried, âfor dying was our choice, And we are glad, new light is in our eyes, New powers of soul are ours: the great deed done Has won us entrance into paradise, The Christ has given us welcome from His throne, And with the Saints in glory we rejoice.â FIELD-MARSHAL LORD ROBERTS, V.C. IN MEMORIAM November 14th Is it not well who loved the Empire whole And served it to the end, his life should yield Full at the front, on Europe's bloodiest field; That he, immortal on the golden roll Of soldier sons, should give to Heaven his soul In clash of war, where armies shocked and reeled, Where bullets sang and cannon's thunder pealed, Should fall on sleep, and win his warrior goal? Ah! not in vain his last brave deed was done Who came to bring his Indian heroes cheer, For that fierce strife his prophet-mind foreknew, And not in vain from silence now we hear A voice we heard not when his trumpet blew To bid the nation gird its armour on. LORD ROBERTS Home-going, Ascot, November 17th Lay lilies o'er himâhis brave heart was pure, Lay roses on himâfor he served his land, Wave palms before him, for he gave his hand To India's gallant chieftains, made them sure As long as chivalry and trust endure, That white and dark were one imperial band To hear their great King-Emperor's command And keep his Empire from all foes secure. But tho' his hands are cold, and not again His warrior lips shall move, the trumpet bring! For none such clarion notes did ever sound To rouse a people from their sleep profound, And none so silently have borne the sting âScorn of a prophet, pleadingâbut in vain. ST. PAUL'S November 19th Let all the whisperings of the mighty dome Be hushed to silence, silent now he nears The last long rest beside his warrior peers; He claims no marble, needs no storied tome To guard his memory, his immortal home Is in the spirit, and the empire rears To-day no cenotaph of idle tears, But bids the hero to her great heart come. There shall he tabernacle till the day When men forget the march to Kandahar, The battle-strokes that made that brave Boer friend; And when these pass a vision still shall stay Of one who great in peace, as great in war, Prevailed by love and served us to the end. LOSS OF H.M.S. âBULWARKâ Sheerness, November 26th Like a strong man who bows but will not weep, So now Great Britain feels within the breast Pain without words: her gallant seamen rest, But all too sudden have they entered sleep; And wrathful that such harvest death should reap, We of our sure defenders dispossessed Chide the devourer of our brave and best âThe hungry and unprofitable deep. But from the waves I see an angel come With crowns and palms, and mighty-voiced she cries, âWeep not! unpained they found an ocean tomb, Life shall be born from fierce destruction's womb, Out of these deeps new bulwarks shall ariseâ The dead we mourn shall shield our island home.â A FRENCH HERO You see the bayonet wound in his back, Of women with babes at breast there was lack, So they caught this man, and as was wont They put their prisoner well in front And drove him on when they made attack. He knew his fate, the stab behind Straight to the heart if he gave alarm, But duty held him close by the arm, To all but his country's service blind, And so when his friends and their trench he neared Though death was behind him he nothing feared, But lifted his voice and loudly cried. Then through his heart Came the swift dart, A moment's agony of pain He felt, but nothing felt again. So for fair France and fellow friends he died, Saviour and hero-seaman, true and tried. Note.ââIn the morning among the dead in front of the French trenches was found the body of the captured French sailor, who, driven on by the Germans in front of their attack, had shouted out the warning. Behind him there had evidently been a German soldier instructed to kill him should he utter a word of warning, for the French sailor had died not through a bullet from his friends in the trenches in front, but from an assassin's thrust from behind.â âCf. The Times, December 1st, 1914. TO A GERMAN HERO Who perished in scuttling Submarine U 18 When from their womb of death we saved the crew And safe aboard the six-and-twenty came, One man remained, to win a deathless nameâ One man aside all hope of living threw, Went down and dared the scuttling-valves unscrew, And sank a prisoner in that iron frame He thus would save from capture and from shame By doing the last duty that he knew. Uncover heads, and bow before his deed, Speak well, ye Britons, of a race that rears Such sons to serve their country to the death. A time shall come when wounds will cease to bleed, Such heroes do but seal with latest breath Our brotherhood in far-off happier years. The British Destroyer Garry, off the North Coast of Scotland, rammed the German submarine U 18, but saved all but one of the crew. He heroically went below to open the scuttling valves, and so, by sinking the submarine, to save it from the hands of the British. THE KING IN FRANCE November 30th Honour the king, who felt the kingliest thing Was this, to honour all who honouring right Had borne the stress of agonising fight To keep an empire for their gracious king; Not empty words he comes to France to bring But honest praise to fill each breast with might, To send the humblest like a new-made knight Forth on the foe with fresh soul-heartening. Alas! how many may not hear his word How many a gallant, having given his best, Lies in the careless earth beneath his feet, But thoughts of love may enter to their rest, And they whose loyal hands have done with sword May know his voice, and feel his words are sweet. A GALLANT RESCUE I was wounded sore in either legâ A bullet in left, a bullet in right, One boon of the surgeon now I beg To make me fit for another fight. They ambushed us well, that Uhlan band, By the mercy of God I am still alive, But before my sword broke short in my hand It had taken its toll of foemen five. Then off we galloped, drew rein and breath, Now where is the Captain? none could tell; And I turned my horse, I would face all death For the sake of a Captain loved so well. I lifted him up where he wounded lay, Sprang to the saddle and held him fast, And back like a whirlwind went the bay, I thought each moment would be our last. I heard the bullets after us sing, But my heart was singing a braver tune, Then I felt in my body a double sting, The warm blood fell, and I feared to swoon. Still on for safety the big bay flew, And still did I grip the Captain tight, Then the bay stopped dead, and all I knew Was the muffled sound of cheersâand night. TO THE FOOTBALL PLAYER An Appeal Play up the game! not yours a football goal, Not with a leathern ball for pay you fight, Your goal is freedom; champion of the right You play to keep the British Empire whole, Wherefore with body under full control, Nerves strong as iron, sinews braced and tight, You join the game with all the world in sight, And losing life at least you win your soul. Player of football! clear above the shame Of thundering plaudits from a circling wall Thunder of guns and cries of wounded come, Your country bids you play a nobler game, Forth to the front! tho' death the âtimeâ may call, Bright angel hosts shall cheer the victor home. A MOTHER'S LAST FAREWELL When for that fierce intolerable fight I bade farewell and held you in embrace Albeit you felt my tears upon your face, You heard me say âGod bless you for the right.â And now I follow you tho' out of sight, And storm with instant prayer the Heavenly place, Praying God shield you, thanking Him for grace Who gave me thus to give my perfect knight. And when through hail of death and fires of hell The nation calls for service to be done, In that supremest moment, have no fears; Think of your mother and her last farewell, Forget the natural falling of my tears, Remember how I blessed my only son. AT A SOLDIER'S GRAVE Blest are the dead, released from rack and strain Of sleepless watch, and day's continual fight, Thunder of guns, the scream of shells and flight Of that death-hawkâthe hovering aeroplane. Now are they freed from bitter frost and rain And glad of heart at last they know the right, Loosed from all hate rejoice in fuller light Where foe is friend, and comes not any pain. Yet tho' they rest in undisturbable sleep And guns roar on, and armies tramp o'erhead Unheeded, tho' from out their gallant blood New love shall spring, I sorrow for the dead, They will not share the harvest we shall reap Nor know the unutterable joy of peace and good. TO LIEUTENANT HOLBROOK AND HIS GALLANT CREW OF SUBMARINE B 11 December 13th Deep in the Dardanelles Safe from all shot and shells Holbrook went creeping, Right thro' the fivefold lines Of those death-dealing mines, Caught the Turk sleeping. Rose, let his thunder slip, Sunk the great battle-ship And, chance at zeroâ Dived; thro' dark-swirling night Death to left, death to right, Came back a hero. TO A CITY BEREAVED Mourn not, O Mother, for the men who gave The best they had for her they loved the best, With eyes enlightened from their world of rest They see a fruitful harvest o'er their grave, Already know the land they strove to save Unvexed by war, by peace and plenty blest Is by its gallant people repossest, Because they died heroically brave. Rather exult, and tho' the tears must fall Smile thro' your tears: once only comes the day That brings to mortals chance of noble death, And these embraced it; with their latest breath They reared against the foe an iron wall And where they built so well they chose to stay. LIFE BEYOND DEATH When bare the trees stand either side the way And all the miry paths are paved with gold, I cannot mourn, I know a richer mould Will keep its store of strength against the day When the warm earth shall dream once more of May, And every branch with quickenings manifold âFeeling again the joy it felt of old Shall claim the life that long in darkness lay. So when I see sad Belgium's stricken field Bestrewn with goldâthe fairest of her youth Who fell like leaves for country and for king, Sad for the bareness and the bitter ruth I cannot weep, I know their dust will yield A nobler manhood and more glorious spring. THE TURK OF WEST AND EAST (On hearing that the Germans had induced the Turks to join in the war) Is it not right the new Turk of the West Should join his hands with that old Eastern crew Who deemed that if a Christian dog they slew Their souls of Paradise were sure possest? For this new Turk by lust of power obsest Has drawn the sword the old assassin drew, His way to empire through the weak will hew And slay the mother with the babe at breast. Is it not meet from out the dust of death These Turks should drag their gods of iron and stone And fill the world with horror and with pain, Till love send forth revivifying breath, Till right not might ascend her ancient throne And Christ with all His Angels come again? THE CHANCELLOR'S SPEECH IN THE REICHSTAG December 2nd They most accuse who most exonerate, And all your pleadings, all your sophistries âTill men enthrone on earth the Father of Liesâ Will not just judgment-doom invalidate Or make your blackness white, your crooked straight, Nor cast blind dust in any nation's eyes. E'en as you spoke, I saw fair Truth arise And sorrowful leave your hall of high debate. But, Chancellor! our pity more than blame Is yours, excusing, you confessor are How deep within your nation's bankrupt soul Chafes wild ambition cheated of its goal, And burns blood-guilt with sense of endless shame For this long-planned inexpiable war. THE GREATER LOVE No man hath greater love, and we have seen it, Here in this red-ripe harvest field of war We take and eat, and generations far Shall be refreshed in spirit as they glean it; No new commandment e'er shall contravene it, No later Gospel shall Christ's message mar, Beam of the light of our great Morning Star, No darkness from our children's eyes shall screen it. For when the coward foe in their advance Drave as a shield before them prisoner men To face the fiery trench, the barbs of wire, They little dreamed a patriot heart of France âThough well he knew death's warrant there and thenâ Would to his comrades shout âFor God's sake, fire!â Near Ypres Frenchmen were driven before a German attacking party; one of them saw that his friends in the trenches were mistaking the advancing foe for Frenchmen, and though he knew that it meant instant death for himself and his comrades right and left of him by French bullets, he cried out, âFor God's sake, fire!â THE LANDING OF THE QUEEN OF THE BELGIANS December 2nd Ne'er knew I queenlier act, nor saw a mien More queenly, as dark-robed she came ashore Knowing the sorrow that was all before, Feeling the sorrow of sorrows that had been. Proudly she passed our silent ranks between As who should say, âFires purge the noblest ore, I had not known my country's need before Now know I she who serves of right is queen; âWherefore I come to-day with queenly will To share the bloody wreckage of my realm With him who yet shall stand a saviour king; Unto our people, hand in hand, we bring The kingdom of a spirit resolute still Crowned with your love, no fate can overwhelm.â THE âGNEISENAUâ Song and Death December 8th With funnels wrecked, sore-wounded in her side The Gneisenau lay dying: then we heard Above the booming cannon's latest word Song such as floats above the Rhineland tide, Song such as fills the Teuton hearts with pride From hill to castled hill. Our souls were stirr'd To think that love of country struck a chord More strong than fear, to help them as they died. For we too loved our country, saw the gleam Of purple woods, green fields, the cottage room, Dear wives and mothers with the babe on knees, We too could die but never yield for theseâ For these could feel death lovely as a dream And meet with song inexorable doom. THE GERMAN RAID Scarborough, December 16th Let the great sea-beast rage! far better so To see him as he is with dragon jaw, The little children in his ravening maw, Than deem him human-hearted, bred to know The code of honour betwixt foe and foe; The waves that rage, the tides that fret and gnaw, These are obedient to a nobler lawâ These when the winds for war their trumpets blow Fight, but they fight with men: this German might Must pit itself with woman and with child Not warriors, but assassins do they comeâ Steal to unarmoured cities in the nightâ Belch forth their fires of hate with madness wild And slink through fog dishonourably home. AT WHITBY ABBEY December 16th King Oswy rises from his dust to-day, And Hilda in her shrine above the shore Proclaims tho' pagan guns of battle roar, Mere lust of might is doomed to pass away. Comes CÃ¦dmon from the stable where he lay Tuning his harp to tell us as of yore That God, Creator, blessed evermore, Still holds high Heaven and Earth in holy sway. Now as of old on bloody Winwoed's field, The Cross shall break the arrow and the bow; And they who look to Heaven shall see the sign That nerved the wavering host of Constantine, And all the men of Streonshalh shall know That Christ, not Odin, is their sword and shield. MUD IN FLANDERS Mud to left and mud to right, Mud all day and mud all night, Mud that percolates like cream, Mud that haunts us in our dream, Mud that half-alive will creep Up our blanket as we sleep, Mud that draws our boots and socks, Mud that jams our rifle locks, Mud that soaks us to the skin Either out of trench or in, Mud on hands and hair and feet, Mud in drink and mud on meat, Mud that crusts the new-made loaf, Kipling! here's your âmuddied oafâ Doing all a man can do, Cheerful mudlarks muddling through, Playing in war's fiercest game For God's right and Britain's name. THE CHRISTMAS BELLS 1914 The Christmas bells but mock me with their sound, And sad of heart the people pass to pray; For they remember how upon a day, When war was hushed the whole wide world around, The Bethlehem shepherds in a stable found A helpless Babe Who in the manger lay, Where weakness donned its royalest array And âPeace on earth, goodwill to menâ was crowned. Ring on, ye Christmas bells, with courage ring! Our belfries stand, unbroken are our towers, And not from east alone, but from the west The kings their homage to the Christ shall bring Who comes again with glory and great powers To bid man know that peace on earth is best. CHRISTMAS CHEER FOR THE TRENCHES An Appeal Here in the trenches, starved and stiff for cold, With death in front, and death-wings overhead, Much need had we our spirits should be fed By some remembrance of the days of old, When with our lanterns to the farm and fold We bore the mistletoe and holly red, And woke and listened from our garret bed For bells whose joy the Christmas message told. And when, in pauses of the fateful fray, Brave hands brought round the welcome Christmas cheer, Our hearts went back to festal-times at home. I saw on rugged faces many a tear. I heard men vow whenever death should come, They'd die for Him who gave them Christmas Day. WAR AND LOVE When I bethink how many a captain died That so his men might liveâhow soldiers gave Their lives that thus their captains they might save, How wounded bound the wounded at their side, Their wounds still bleeding, and to bearers cried, âLeave me but carry him,ââmy hope is brave, I feel from this unending battle's grave Rises new life with tenderness alive. For tho' begot of hate and born in sin Still on thy knees O war a sense is nursed, âA sense of joy which brotherhood shall prove, And at thine ending best shall follow worst, Schooled in thy school the nations shall begin To learn the magnanimity of love. Note.âA sergeant-major of the 2nd Royal Munster Fusiliers writes: âOfficers share the same hardships as the men. In fact a little more. They are absolutely splendid, every one of them. This will just tell you the class they are: Colonel Bent got wounded trying to save a wounded private, who lay in his trench, and when the stretcher-bearers went for him, he refused to be moved before the wounded men were taken first. It was the same with Major Thompson. He lay outside his trench of dead and wounded, and still issued orders to his men till he died from exposure. Major Day's last words were, âWrite to my wife. Let her know I died a happy death.â Captain O'Brien left his bit of cover and gave it to a private and was killed a few moments after.â CAPTAIN A. NOEL LOXLEY H.M.S. âFormidableâ January 1st, 1915 âSteady, men! keep cool, keep cool.â So they kept your golden rule. In your voice and in your face not a trace of fear. âTons of life are in her yet, Keep your heart up.â So you met Death in its terrific formâdeath and storm with cheer. Men above the hurricane Heard your orders calm and plain Till your ship sore hurt to death plunged beneath the sea. There upon the bridge you stood, Spirit more than flesh and blood, Your Commander at your sideâso you died for me. Loxley! happier glad new year In that warless, watchless sphere Where the brave the brave man meets from the fleets of yore. Tell great Nelson still we keep His inviolable deep That for all their coward blows, from the Lizard to the Nore, Never foes have come ashore. IN A HARVEST FIELD How quietly beneath the quiet sky These men are sleeping who shall never wake, But soon the plough, the harrow and the rake Shall pass them as I pass unheeded by; For underneath the fallows they will lie, Who front to foeâgood seed for Freedom's sakeâ Have fallen, and those who here their harvest make Will wonder at the richness of the rye. But He Who lets no single sparrow fall Unnoted, unremembered, in His care Has garnered all their great self-sacrifice, And tho' too soon in tender earth there lies Till crack of doom each body made so fair, A happier world shall be memorial. TARES AND WHEAT When I bethink me of war's harvest field And who hath sown the tares among the wheat, Who trampled treaties 'neath his cloven feet And bade humanity's laws be all repealed, Who stole for death life's scientific yield, Who murdered in cold blood and not in heat, Then I thank God there is a judgment seat Before whose bar earth's secrets are revealed. We war to-day but not with flesh and blood, With unseen powers and principalities, With rulers of the dark in heavenly places, For right and freedom of the lesser races; And with us war invincible alliesâ Honour, and peace, and human brotherhood. A CONTRAST I by the lapping of my household fire, You in the trenches, stiff and stark for cold, You by fatigue in few days grey and old, I with my strength no needs, no calls require: I wrapt in all the peace of heaven entire, You with hell's powers of darkness fold on fold, You lacking all that life most dear can hold, And I with all my utmost heart's desire. But God shall strike the balance: I have had My good in this my lifetimeâall and more, Have selfish sucked advantage from your strife, While you, brave heroes, on that further shore Shall find all good has equalized all bad; Death may be mine, you win eternal life. THE SOLDIER'S PRAYER For me you drill, for me you fight, I cannot run your soldier's race, What can I do but praise your might And pray God send you grace. For me knee-deep in mud you plod To death who cures us all of cold, What can I do but pray to God Your hand in His to hold. Why should I vex the willing air And pierce high Heaven with prayerful cries, Seeing that all you do is prayer Of glorious sacrifice? THE BLESSING OF WAR Almighty ministrant of power thro' pain, Comfort for irremediable woe, Humbler of arrogance, raiser of the low, Bidding us all once more the heights attain Of self-forgetful service, once more gain The ineffable joy of those who face the foe For truth and right, and in red fallows sow For far-off generations wholesome grain. How can we praise enough thy potent spell To weld in one unfailing bond of love Comrade to comrade on the stricken field, To open gates of Heaven with keys of Hell And welcome those heroic souls who prove A patriot's passion was their sword and shield. THE GRANDEUR OF WAR We who must sit at home and nurse our heart To still endure intolerable pain, We cannot guess the grandeur and the gain Of that fierce stage whereon with soldier art The actor plays a soul-inspiring part. He feels heroic impulse born again, He knows death's agonies are not in vain, That from his blood new life, new joy will start. Far off he sees confederate nations strong To crush all tyranny that walks the earth, Far off he hears the tender steps of peace, Each sword-stroke smites a hydra-headed wrong, Each crash of shell is herald of the birth Of freedom and of brotherhood's increase. Note.âExtract from a letter of a young officer since killed in action: âI cannot tell you how much I enjoy it all. There is something so noble, so great about the whole show which places it on a far higher plane than any other scene in which one has acted in this life.â AT THE WISHING-GATE, GRASMERE New Year's Day, 1915 At this old wishing-gate above the mere How many with dim eyes and hearts that ache To-day see faces dearer for death's sake, And wish God give us all a happier year; Wishing they feel a momentary cheer, But swift the vision fades, old sorrows wake And wan as death below them lies the lake, The mountains stand around them dark and drear. But in the dawn beside the wishing-gate I stand. A vision rises to my sight âA fadeless visionâEurope free from war, The word of kings henceforth inviolate, Britain made pure by pain, and lo! day's star O'er Wansfell lifts, and all the world is bright. NEW YEAR 1915 To-day how many thousands will not hear There in their timeless changeless world of light, The sad year's solemn passing in the night, The silent coming of a happier year. For this new year, though full of woe and fear Shall prove that right has triumphed over might, Shall see an end of war's accursÃ©d blight, And peace among the nations drawing near. We cannot hear their voices, clasp their hands, The faces that we loved no more we see, But they whose names are bright on honour's roll In some far world shall know we reached their goal, That nobler for their deed our empire stands Crowned with the will that set all Europe free. THE DAY OF INTERCESSION January 3rd Not with torn robe or ashes on our head We stand, O Lord! to-day before Thy Throne, Confessing sins our heedlessness had sown, The blight of ease, the lust of mammon bred, But with bruised hearts and wounded hands outspread; Thee the Absolver, Thee our God we own, And bring for our backsliding to atone Our best as offeringâall our glorious dead. Now in the fierce war-furnace purged of dross We know the nation's noblest school is pain, Good faith and honour are the golden things, What once we counted gain we hold but loss, So peace arise with healing in her wings, So right not might unconquerably may reign. TO PAUL SABATIER On reading his letter in âThe Times,â January 22nd, 1915 Dear friend with whom one time I talked, Saint Francis at our side, Where thro' Ancona's March he walked With Poverty for bride, We thank you for the words of flame That kindle in the soul, Words that must put all hearts to shame Who cannot see our goal; You know as your apostle knew Our hope for right is this, That Peace 'ere she the world renew With Righteousness shall kiss. You know tho' babblers prate of peace, We war on truth's behalf, Until the foe from power-lust cease And slay the golden calf; You know tho' France and Britain die, Tho' Belgium cease to be, There is a voice which cannot lie That pleads for liberty. We war but not with swords alone, We fight no mortal foes, Defenders of no earthly throne We bear these battle-throes. Breathe on us all courageous breath We own Saint Francis' name, There is a dying worse than death A living worse than shame. THE CURSE OF WAR When I consider how this bloody war, Conceived in hate and born of brutish pride, Raves like a hungry beast unsatisfied And what it cannot ravin will ruthless mar, When I perceive blood-fury breaks the bar That curbs the beast in man, flings open wide The gate for power as God personified And lights the dark with kultur's baleful star, Then I remember they who take the sword Must perish by the sword,âmight crushed by might; That dragons' teeth so sown shall spring again, That war puts off the coming of the Lord, Postpones the time when brotherhood shall reign, Makes earth a hell and fills the world with blight. THE NATION'S TEACHERS I saw in dream an empire on its knees, There on the mount of God, linked hand in hand, Behold two mighty angels seemed to stand Whose trumpet-voices drowned the litanies. I cried, âO Heavenly Father, what are these?â And He made answer, âThese at My command Are sent to be the teachers of your land, They bear to men My judgment's stern decrees.â âWhat are their names?â E'en as I spake a voice Came clear from Heaven, âOne angel is called Pain, And one Adversity or Tribulation, Hark to their words, so strength shall ye regain, Hear them aright, and lo! a humbler nation Shall rise to heights of greatness and rejoice.â THE âLION'Sâ CHASE January 24th It was on a Sunday morn that the German raiders came To work upon defenceless towns their deed of coward shame, When Beattie put to sea to anticipate their game, And the Tiger following after, the Lion led the way. Then sudden thro' the mist their Admiral saw a sight That made him feel a pair of heels was better far than fight, For safety and his mine-field he turned and took to flight, He could kill our English babies but he durst not face the fray. So we formed in line ahead while our stokers stoked with willâ Cleared for action, laid our guns, gave each battle breech its fill, Kept our ships from out their wake lest their mines should work us ill, And we followed keen as hounds who in view their quarry keep. And our sailors set their teeth for their wives and babes ashore, Then the Lion roared aloud and we answered to his roar, And our thirteen fives with thunder raked the BlÃ¼cher aft and fore Till she heeled and groaning sank thro' the bitter Northern deep. We saved the drowning seamen then we flew upon the track, Gave them more than they had asked for though they gave us little back, To Helgo's mines and harbour we drove the wounded pack, A present for the Kaiser on the Kaiser's natal day. Here's a health to all our sailors who sail the Northern deep, Who serving king and country keep watch that we may sleep, To-day on happy mothers' knees the babes may crow and leap, And unafraid about our streets the little children play. A PLEA FOR MILITARY BANDS A Reminiscence of the Mansion House Meeting, January 27th Our hearts were made by Him Who called each star And sent it singing on its rhythmic way, Who set the great sea drumming in the bay, Who bade the winds blow trumpets from the scar; Wherefore we need strong musicâbeat and bar For thoughts unvoiced, for words we fain would say, To be for wearied feet soul-heartening stay And send our host united to the war. Roll drums, blow trumpets, clanging cymbals beat, If these should cease let pipes and fife be heard, Where'er our soldiers go may song abound; No men shall march in silence down the street, And every heart shall feel its hopes are stirred To exultation by triumphant sound. THE RETURN OF SPRING Spring returns, the daisies peep, Celandines awake from sleep, But you come not back nor know How the daffodillies grow; You are laid too deep. Spring returns, but with its breath Purple-robed as if for death Beech trees stand, and by the stream Red as blood the sallows gleamâ You are blind beneath. Spring returns. Ah! not for me Joy returns by lawn and lea, From my soul can ne'er depart Winter's cold, and in my heart Sun no more can be. Tho' I scarce the birds can hear, See unmoved the flowers appear, Yet I know you died to bring To the nation's life new spring And I shed no tear. Then from near the sobbing Aisne, Where you lie with countless slain, Cries a voice one time I heard And with shame my soul is stirr'd, âDeath was not in vain.â Cries the voice, âOur death shall flower Into more than lust of power, Other eyes than ours shall see Peace spring up and liberty, Love's immortal dower. Brotherhood shall bud anew, Gentleness descend like dew, Faith in honour's plighted word Blossom once again, the sword Wonder why it slew. Wherefore mourn not,â cries the voice, âSpring returns, rejoice! rejoice! Tho' the kind earth hold us deep We have sown, let others reap, Dying was our choice.â TO AMERICA You who went forth to find a larger room For fair humanity, you who later broke In freedom's name the slaver's bitter yoke, Can you not read the inevitable doom Of freedom shut within an iron tomb By hands that waste the homes of innocent folk, That murder wounded men with bayonet stroke, And sink our Red Cross ships with coward bomb? Bewitched by whomâgreat daughter of the West Unmoved of heart can you in silence see Assyrian hate and Babylonian ways Come back to plague our Europe's later days, Nor rise with indignation to protest And cry through all the world âThis shall not be?â Note.âAn attempt was made on February 1st to torpedo a Red Cross hospital ship, the Asturia, near Havre, and a brigade order was discovered in the diary of a German of the 112th Regiment, that all French, whether wounded or not, who fell into the enemy's hands were to be shot, whilst accounts reach us from time to time of the killing of the wounded on the field of battle. LOVE ON THE BATTLE-FIELD A picture in âThe Sphere,â February 13th Left lone upon the battle-field A wounded German lay, The Fatherland in life his shield In death was still his stay, Save unto death too proud to yield, For death his lips could pray. He saw me sad above him bend And murmured hoarse and low, âYes, hold my hand until the end For soon my soul must go, In such a case man needs a friend Albeit the friend be foe.â Of home and loved ones far he spoke, Of battle's loss and gains, Of how with slow or sudden stroke Death ends all mortal pains, Then the cord loosed, the bowl was broke, âGod's loving-cup remains. For as I held him by the hand And gazed upon his face, I seemed that bond to understand Which binds the human race, I felt all war-lords must be banned And love be lord in place. HONOUR TO THE DEAD He took the cross of honour that he wore And pinned it on the dead insensate breast, âBrother,â he cried, âthe bravest and the best, Wear it for me, your deed deserved it more, Life still is mine with battle chance in store, Better that thus of guerdon dispossest, I gladlier go upon adventurous quest Because you bear my honour on before.â So should we do for all the good and brave, To their dead hands our honour should we give Content to win not only to have won; For they have done with battleâbut we live, Their voices sound like trumpets from the grave To cheer us still more resolutely on. Note.âAfter a Serbian battle a soldier kneeling above his brother fallen dead at his side, took off his cross of honour and pinned it upon the dead man's breast, saying, âHe deserved it more than I did, and I will win another.â âThe Contemporary Review, January 9th, 1915. THE TWO SPRINGS With exultation singing in the dawn Again the blackbird's fluting voice I hear, I see in starry clusters on the lawn The daisies punctual to their time appear. The coltsfoot with his honey-scented sun Brings back the light to bank and hedgerow pale, Thrilled with new joy the birches have begun To purple all the woodland in the dale. But you to that far land have gone away Where glad hearts need no merry birds to sing, Where no night comes to end the weary day And winter asks no jubilance of spring. Sing birds, shine flowers on earth, your voices call My heart up higher to that diviner clime, To where beyond death's silent circling wall God gives his heroes life's perpetual prime. Where blooms the amaranthine hope of good, Where the one song of love can never cease, Where the great sun of angel brotherhood Brings in the summer of eternal peace. Wherefore tho' not for you the daisies peep, And not for you the blackbird lifts his voice, My gallant soldier lad I cannot weep, You in a happier world than mine rejoice. MICHAEL O'LEARY AND HOW HE WON THE VICTORIA CROSS February 1st I can spell the village name, sir, I cannot call it right, But O'Leary got us fame, sir, When he won it in fair fight. When the word was passed for storming And we got our hand grenades, While our company was forming Just to take the barricades, O'Leary's eyes were brighter Than the eyes of all the rest, For O'Leary was a fighter, Fighter born the first and best. Off we went and at the double Thro' the hail of German lead, Some were soon beyond all trouble, Shot thro' heart and shot thro' head. But the sprinter Mike O'Leary Led us by a hundred yards, Hard of breath but shouting cheery, âFollow! follow! Irish Guards!â Past the barrier he went flying, And we heard his rifle crack, And we found five Germans dying When we raced to the attack. But the foeman's fire was playing From the second barricade, And he heard old Erin saying, Mike O'Leary lend your aid. Up the near embankment leaping, One against the German five, Three he swiftly sent a-sleeping And took two of them alive. So O'Leary single-handed Stormed the barriers without loss, The King heard, and he commanded, âGive him Queen Victoria's Cross.â In the trenches days are weary And the nights are cold and long, But the deed of Mike O'Leary Stirs us like a marching song. Note.âLance-Corporal Michael O'Leary, 1st Battalion Irish Guards, formed one of the storming party which advanced against the enemy's barricades at Cuinchy on February 1st, 1915. He rushed to the front and himself killed five Germans who were holding the first barricade, and then attacked the second barricade about sixty yards further on, which he captured after killing three Germans and taking two alive, thus practically taking the enemy's position by himself. For description of his gallant feat see The Times, March 2nd. THE BLOCKADE February 18th Never till faced with unforeseeable ill, Never till set about with toils of fate Has Britain proved her title to be great And shown a world in arms her hero will; Wherefore with teeth tight-clenched but calmly, still She bides this day of agony and hate, All foeman's threat dares resolute await Knowing she shall her destined course fulfil. Still thro' the terror of the treacherous deep, Thro' mines and lurking deeds of dastard shame To unarmed hulls, her mariners will come With the old daring to their island home, While she who sowed our shores with death shall reap The bitter harvest of a pirate's name. TO THE STRIKERS Will nothing rouse you! not the finger of scorn Pointed by patriotic Teutons, nor the fears Of France, nor Belgium's blood and Belgian tears Frustrate of hoping for the earlier morn Of peace among the peoples battle-worn? Then let the cry of Britons in your ears âBetrayed by you who sent them forth with cheersâ Sound from the trenches lost and overborne. For how without munition can they stand Against the invader, how ensure supplies Without the keels and guns that guard the flood? While trading on the realm's necessities Inopportune you wrangle for your hand And weigh your wage against a brother's blood. TO THE MEN ON STRIKE Brothers one in heart are we, One in work of head and hand, Sworn to keep our nation free, Vowed to save our native land. Loyal to one sovereignâGeorge, Soldiers of one battle line, Under fire of foe, or forge, Labouring in the trench, or mine. Wherefore he who puts his pay First, and last his country's need, Doth an empire's cause betray, He shall win a traitor's meed. Shame the Devil! up with tools! Forward with a patriot's eyes! Learn in this the best of schools, Freedom means self-sacrifice. A LOVER'S LAMENT The rooks are gleaming in the sun, The cheerful peewits twinkle gay, To mellow skies the fallows run From purple into grey. Now gold above the withered sedge The ivory-budded sallow stands, And woodbine tendrils in the hedge Put forth their dainty hands. Not yet the coltsfoot disc is seen Albeit the snowdrop pearls are here, And with their ruffs of tender green The aconites appear. But vain are these distractions given, Spring may return but not to me, The very sun is dark in heaven, My love has crossed the sea. Perchance upon the fatal field E'en now he lies, my gallant brave, Spring flowers their garniture will yield, They cannot hide his grave. A BRAVE DOCTOR In Honour of Dr. D. C. Turnbull Hero of that heroic doctors' band Whose help our empire never can repay, Healer of wounds when others all would slay, Giver of life where others death had planned, Led by compassion and at love's command Thro' bullet storm you went your perilous way, And under fire you stanched throughout the day The spirting wound by pressure of your hand. Then cloaked by friendly darkness forth of hell You brought a brother from his living grave, Mailed in the might that God incarnate wore âThe might of sacrificeâto safety bore Your brother but wounded mortally you fell, Others you saved, yourself you could not save. Note.âDr. Turnbull of the R.A.M.C., an old student of Sheffield University, learned about 10 a.m. one day that an officer was lying badly wounded in a trench 400 yards beyond the dressing station. It meant almost certain death to reach him by daylight. He took the risk and went through. He removed him to a communication trench, a heavy German fire was turned upon him, and all through that day he lay in the trench pressing an artery by hand to check the bleeding. When darkness fell, helped by an orderly, Dr. Turnbull lifted the officer and started on the perilous journey. He got his patient safely through, but in doing so he received a shot through the lung, from which he subsequently died. âCf. The Daily Mail, March 20th, 1915. SPRINGTIME AND WAR âLords and ladiesâ all in waiting, Rise within your tents of green, Spring is coming, birds are mating, Rise and bow before your queen. Gold dust for her loyal vassals Wind is scattering far and free, âGold from yew and hazel tassels âPollen for the honey bee. Spring is coming, go to meet her, Woods are sweet with primrose breath, Daffodils are here to greet her, Elder tufts and woodbine wreath. Birds more blithely meet each morrow, Lambs for joyance leap and run, All the earth has ceased from sorrow From the dawn to set of sun. Then, rebuker of my gladness, Thunder of the battle-day, Roaring roll'd and war's wild madness Drove my dreams of spring away. But from out my cloud of sadness Sunlight broke for hope was king, Freedom, justice, right and gladness Sure shall wake to peaceful spring. SWITZERLAND THE GOOD SAMARITAN (Dedicated to Dr. Ernest Roethlisberger) Thanks to the Swiss, the brave free-hearted breed Who loving home know others love it well, Who taking pity on those forced to dwell In durance vile, have helped the prisoner's need. Sowers they are of friendship's golden seed, Giving us glimpse of heaven in time of hell, Men of the tender heart of William Tell, Men of the generous will of Winkelried. Wherefore to-day we take you by the hand And bow before your thoughtfulness and grace, And as men praise the Good Samaritan We praise you for your kindness face to face; For nobler friendship ne'er was shown to man Than this your loveâcompassionate Switzerland! Note.âThe Swiss organisation at Geneva for the repatriation of interned prisoners has already been the means of returning 20,000 people to their homes. âCf. The Times, March 20th, 1915. IN MEMORIAM 2nd Lieutenant G. B. F. Monk, Royal Warwicks Near La BassÃ©e, December 18th Across the fire-swept zone we went So frenzied that we neither knew What bullets stung, what red blood flew, How shrapnel burst, how men were sent Back to their dust for Britain's sake, That day we Warwicks strove to take The hidden gun that barked and slew. How many went! how few returned! The darkness fell, outshone the stars Whose peaceful eyes rebuke our wars, High o'er our heads Jove's planet burned, But one more star in heaven was bright, The courage of a soldier-knight Whose soul had passed our mortal bars. Well had he led us, well and straight. At dawn we found in tangled wire His body stiff, but still afire With onsetâfor the charge elate; As tho' no death could tame his will His arm outstretched, hand pointing still Toward the gun that sealed his fate. So had he fall'n, his body caught, His heart still travelling towards its goal No nobler more impetuous soul Passed; and when Christ His truce-day brought, Lo! foes were friends, and called him brave, Joined in sad service o'er the grave Of one who dying peace had wrought. Note.âLieutenant Monk was charging ahead of his men to discover and put out of action a deadly machine gun when he fell; and when his body was found next morning it was seen to be caught in wire entanglements. His hand was still outstretched towards the gun, and his mouth apparently actually calling his men forward. He was buried between the trenches, and on Christmas Day the Germans and English joined in a funeral service round his grave. HOW LIEUTENANT LEACH AND SERGEANT HOGAN WON THE VICTORIA CROSS October 28th Along the zigzag trench they crept For Britain's sake toward the goal, And now with right and now with left The swift revolver took its toll, For sergeant and lieutenant swore They'd win the trench they'd held before. The surly Germans driven back From point to point their wounded bare Till cowering in a cul-de-sac They sudden raised their hands in air, And sixteen men without ado Surrendered to our gallant two. Then with their twenty wounded came Those sixteen prisoners sad and slow, How little of their wide-world fame Did sergeant and lieutenant know, What daring planned had duty done And this they knew the trench was won. Note.âLieutenant Leach determined to retake the trench which the Germans had occupied. Leaving ten men behind him, he went forward with Sergeant Hogan, and at each angle of the trench was able by revolver fire to drive the Germans back without giving them the chance of using their rifles. Meanwhile Sergeant Hogan placing his cap on his rifle kept our own men aware of their position in the trench, so that they might prevent any sudden attack upon them from above. The Germans and their wounded men with an English prisoner retreated to a cul-de-sac, and suddenly, through the mouth of the Englishman, they cried, âDon't shoot! we wish to surrender.â Then they threw up their hands, and sixteen of them were made prisoners. Twenty other Germans had been wounded, and the whole convoy was marched from the trench to our lines. âCf. The Manchester Guardian, February 23rd, 1915. HOPE FOR THE DAWN Could you but see the sunrise o'er Helvellyn, The lights that flush its fawn to amber gold, Could your brave eyes but momently behold In the far gorge whence Derwent's stream is welling, The purple mist that weaves for dawn her dwelling, Could you but watch the daffodil unfold Or hear the voices that you loved of old Where merle to merle her faith in spring is telling, Then Borderersâbred in ancient Cumberland, Sons of the shining mountains and the mere, Men of the fellside and the milk-white farm, I know the hope of morningtide would arm Your hearts, and firm as rock your feet would stand For that new dawn's deliverance drawing near. AFTER A SERMON IN ST. MARGARET'S, WESTMINSTER March 28th Friends, let us suffer for the cause is great, Let us endure heroically brave, Give back compassion for the Teuton's hate And from his madness strive the foe to save. But not by counsel rashly premature Blind him to think he shall escape the rod, Who led the people by ambition's lure To set grim Moloch in the place of God. Let us be just and fear not; forward all To crush no people but a people's sin, To save all Europe from a tyrant's thrall And brotherhood by freedom's way to win. THE KING'S APPEAL March 31st Such from of old has been the kingliest way, So knew the knights of Arthur's Table-Round, So down at Athelney in camp and mound They learned who followed Alfred night and day; For how could reverence for the king have sway Or how should loyalty full-souled abound Save when the royal word by deed was crown'd And the law-giver did his laws obey? Wherefore ye knights of labour rise and prove Your will to help the country's sorest need, Hear the clear voice with which your king has called, Cast off the shackles that have held you thralled, Follow with loyal hearts a royal lead And by self-mastery save the land we love. GOOD FRIDAY 1915 Ah! not alone upon the barren hill âHill of the skull beside Damascus gateâ There stands a cross whose love can conquer hate; For by the moorland hut, the city mill, The farms whose orchards gleam with daffodil, By lowly cot, and palace of the great, It lifts its arms to conquer death and fate And prove immortal powers are with us still. And o'er each cross the Christ from glory bends With outstretched hands compassionate to prove Which way the world's redemption still must lie. Unheard before, I hear His clarion cry, âLo! greater love hath no man than his love Who willing gives a life to save his friends.â EASTER DAY 1915 To-day the mother's heart her son embraces, To-day the father hearsâtho' eyes are dimâ His boy beside him sing the Easter Hymn; With glorious wounds now healed and with no traces Of pain upon their proud triumphant faces, Alert, and as the angels strong of limb, Our lads troop homeward in their battle trim And haunt once more the old familiar places. For many bodies from the graves arise Appearing unto many, and we feel The church is filled with more than we can see; Weâtheyâone army sworn for Christ to free All Europe from the hate of blood and steel And bring back love by life's pure sacrifice. STARLIGHT I passing from my student's narrow cell, Absorbed in thought of this world's trivial might, Found suddenly my soul took wider flight; High o'er the circling walls of ebon fell The heaven with worlds whose number none could tell Shone diamond-crusted,âeyes of burning light Looked thro' me, voices sounded from the height Bidding me gaze where the immortals dwell. Each glittering star seemed some heroic soul Who having served his time was set to shine As beacon to his fellows here on earth, Brave men whose courage won the heights divine, Who gave their lives to find new joy had birth And sacrifice was being's ultimate goal. HELM CRAG The rain has passed, red streams of fern Among black shaly torrents burn Beneath the April sun. And borne upon their dreadful flood To that waste land of fire and blood My thoughts perforce will run. âCrag of the Helm!â I cried, âtho' still Thy ancient name by dale and hill Of battle-mail must sound, The Lion and the Lamb shall lie One day like thine in amity, And peace on earth be found.â TO PRUSSIA When you loosed hell you did not know You loosed all heaven on earth as well, Still spirit strives with flesh below And angels with us dwell. We fight, but with no mortal sword, We thunder, not with earthly guns, For freedom and the living Lord We rise to meet the Huns. Flushed with your plenitude of power You drave the Christ from off His throne, Bade Thor and Odin bring their dower Of blood and iron and stone. You dreamed that âfrightfulnessâ of death Would lead your hosts to victory, You see with calm untroubled breath Our best go forth to die. You held that might not right was all, You were as God to choose the day, You find when wall and tower fall, That courage still can stay. In rule and drill you put your trust, Where cunning served you cunning chose, You cast all honour to the dust And made the world your foes. To reign not serve, to get not give, These were the watchwords of your goal, You fail, but truth and freedom live, And Europe finds her soul. IN MEMORY Of 2nd Lieutenant W. G. C. Gladstone, M.P. April 13th He wrote from the trenches to his mother, âReally you will be wrong if you regret my going, for I am very glad and proud to have got to the Front. It is not length of existence that counts, but what is achieved during that existence, however short.â Those were brave words, and tho' our hearts must bleed To think that Hawarden shall not see you more, Surely the great glad army gone before Shall feel your high companionship of deed. You heard the call, you sprang to meet the need, For you life stood not in day's length and store But in the strong will at the great heart's core, To do and beâto sow the patriot's seed. And you have sown it, you have given your best âClear-sighted courage that foreseeing all Deliberate chose the knightliest noblest way; How could you put your fellows to the test Yourself untested, how in safety stay While others went to fight, if need be fall? TAKE ME HOME Forth from the shelter-trench he sprang, Forgot the very land that bore him, Above the storm of onset rang One voiceâstern duty went before him. A bullet stung him and he fell, The very wound new powers had given, âForward!â he cried, âtho' this be hell I know the way that leads to heaven.â Heaven for us all is just that line Of spirting flame and maxim-rattle, One trench the nearer to the Rhine One hundred yards the prize of battle, âFollow!â A second bullet sped, Shells burst, a splinter fiercely tore him, We loosed his coat, we raised his head And stretcher-bearers sad bent o'er him. âThink not of me,â he cried, âbut bear To safety these my wounded brothers, To them the chance of life is dear, They too have friends and wives and mothers.â Then slowlier did his breathing come, And we who knelt in grief beside him Heard him appeal, âHome, take me home!â As a child asks, and who shall chide him? For all the fury of the fight Had faded, he had done his duty, Now only rose before his sight His dear dear land of peace and beauty. He saw the wood behind the hall, Green knolls with cattle gently lowing, He heard far-off the waterfall, The stream along the valley flowing. He saw the larch with ruby buds, The birch tree like a golden fountain, And high above the wakening woods Blue moor and ever bluer mountain. How peacefully with call to prayer, The far-off village bells were ringing, How glad thro' primrose-scented air The cuckoo called, the thrush was singing. Ah! who could blame him when he cried For that fair land of rock and heather, For home he lived, for home he died, God made and knit their hearts together. Note.âThis poem is founded on an incident in the death of Lieutenant Crichton, as reported in T.P.'s Journal of Great Deeds, April 24th, p. 35. THE EVER-LIVING ONES I cannot mourn our men who lie Between the Marne and Aisne, To the unwise they seem to die And pass away in pain. But when the hammers cease to ring Of Odin and of Thor, They shall return with Christ as King And triumph evermore. For they who fell have died in faith That peace shall follow strife, That selfishness is worse than death And sacrifice is life. LOVE'S GIFT An incident of the battle-field When after furious fight Falls on the fallen, night, And in the cooler blood Rewakens brotherhood, Tho' foe be laid by foe There works a common woe, Great love in mercy bends Above, and makes them friends. So at the close of day On the grim field there lay German and English, foes Made friends by common woes Of wound and failing breath, Of waiting upon death, Of pain 'neath moon and stars That know not pain nor wars. From English lips there came Cry of fierce thirst like flame, The dying German heard And all his body stirred Helpless in seeming pain, Writhing as if in vain, His blind hands were in quest But could not find their rest. Then he whose parched lips burned Unto his brother turned, And 'neath his body found The war-flask whole and sound Wherein the sons of Rhine Store for the battle, wine; Opened it and in haste Bade fevered lips to taste. But the faint lips found voice: âTo drink is not my choice, This draught will not serve two, I yield it all to you. Drink, Englishman! for I Sore wounded needs must die, All, all to you I give; Drink, brother, drink and live.â Note.âA dying German and a wounded Englishman were laid close beside one another on the battlefield. The Englishman involuntarily cried out in his great thirst. The German heard it, and at once began to move his arm as though he wished to change his position, but in his helplessness could not. The Englishman turned over to render him help, and then found that the German was attempting to reach his water-bottle. The Englishman got hold of it, found it full of wine and water, and opening it pressed it to the German's lips. âNein, nein,â faintly murmured the dying man, âyou drink it, for I die.â RUPERT BROOKE Lemnos, April 23rd Helper of England, freedom, faith, and right! Apollo loved his fair-haired child too well, And when into those jealous arms he fell He gave for dawn and song the silent night; Sleep 'neath the shining olives on the height, Or where Ãgean waters work their spell Bringing from earth the moon-white asphodel To mingle with the wind-flowers burning bright. For never since upon his golden quest To Lemnos Jason with his Argo came And Orpheus sang the maidens back to love, Has sweeter singer on this isle found rest Than he who warrior-poet died to prove The patriot's inextinguishable flame. RHODES-MOORHOUSE Prince of the knights of air Who live to do and dareâ To dare and die that Britain be kept whole, Poor is the praise we bring And weak our words to wing With song an empire's gratitude of soul. But we who saw you sweep To Courtrai and down-leap Thro' shot and shell and launch your bomb, held breath To wonder at your skill, To marvel at the will That bade you turn for home and race with Death. Foredoomed, shot thro' and thro', One thing you could not doâ You could not yield your brave wings to the foe, Others when you had gone Might with them wing alone Dauntless to bring back newsâthe bomb to throw. So tho' your eyes grew dim With grip unloosed and grim You steered for home and gently swooped to ground, Stayed your soul fain for flight, Gave your last message right, Then swooned and passed beyond all battle-sound. When, when shall ever fade The hero's flight you made, The gallant race you rode with Death and won! Oh, conquerors of the air Who live to do and dare, Has Dorset ever reared a braver son? Note.âSecond-Lieutenant William Barnard Rhodes Rhodes-Moorhouse of Parnham House, Dorset, one of the most daring of our younger airmen, flew off alone in his biplane to Courtrai. Gliding down to a height of 300 ft. while he was the target of hundreds of rifles and of anti-aircraft armament, he dropped a large bomb on the railway junction. He was severely wounded in the thigh and might have saved his life by coming down in the enemy's lines. But he decided to save his machine at all costs, and descending to a height of only 100 ft. in order to increase his speed, he made for home, and was again wounded, this time mortally. He still flew on, however, and without coming down at the nearest of our aerodromes he went all the way back to his own base; here he executed a perfect landing and made his report. He died in hospital not long afterwards. âThe Times, May 3rd. THE BIBLE OF PEACE Dunnabeck If you could see the night and morning made From this aerial cottage of delight, You would forget the fury of the fight And cease to fear the far-off cannonade; For here since Briton builded his stockade Or Roman ran his way across the height, Peace never from her home has taken flight, No war has dared her sacred haunts invade. God needs must hold some monument secure For man and nations and brotherhood on earth, Must somewhere keep an open Bible still Wherefrom a voice of admonition pure May spell from quiet lawn and lake His will And herald Love's inevitable birth. MAY TIME 1915 Tho' birds sing and flowers are gay In our hearts is sadness, Many sons have gone away âSons who cannot feel to-day Joy in springtide gladness. Sons who see not any more The awakening splendour Of the farmstead sycamore, When she sheds her coral store And her leaf is tender. Sons who not again can know Ash-buds shake to feather, Nor behold the cherry snow, Foaming damson, starry sloe Blossoming together. Cannot see the birches turn Into emerald fountains, Nor how fellsides cease to burn When the groves of bracken fern Repossess the mountains. But more glorious things they see And from peaceful Heaven Comes a voice of cheer to me, By our death new life shall be, Happier Mays be given. THE âLUSITANIAâ May 7th There is new wailing in the winds that sweep About Kinsale, the breakers round the Head Mourn with new lamentation for the dead, Where unvindictive the compassionate deepâ More merciful than mortalsâgives its sleep; And in the ocean of man's mind is bred The sorrowful sea's communicable dread With pain that all the centuries shall keep. But upon older shores than old Kinsaleâ The shores of Love's sure purposeâblest and bound By law no sea-wolves made or overthrow, Louder than indignation's rising gale Or cries for vengeance, I can hear the sound Of doom upon a world-dishonoured foe. Note.âThe Lusitania, an unarmed Cunard liner, with a crew and passengers numbering 2,160, was sunk, without any warning, off Kinsale Head by a German submarine on Friday afternoon, May 7th. This dastardly act by which nearly 1500 non-combatants were drowned without any chance of their leaving the ship by its boats, is without parallel in the history of war. AT WORDSWORTH'S GRAVE Beneath the yew by Rothay's freeborn stream Filled with your music, crystal as your heart, To-day from all the world I go apart; A hundred years roll backward as in dream, All of yourself that doth immortal seem Comes from the grave to bear a patriot's part, Your pealing clarion tuned by sonnet art Sounds, and your brave song-banners forward gleam. Wordsworth! an empire needs you at this hour, For now a second tyrant stands confest, A ruthless wide-world dominating foe; Oh! turn not, mighty spirit, to your rest, But bid us forth as happy warriors go With freedom's unimaginable power.</field>
