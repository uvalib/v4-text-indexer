      <field name="fulltext">âThe waves of the sea have spoken to me; the wild birds have taught me; the music of many waters has been my master.â The Poet of the Finnish Epic âKalevala.â FROM THE HILLS OF DREAM Cathair-Sith. From green to white, from white to green, I watch the waves that wash between The Rainbow-Pillars none hath seen. God takes a wind from out the sky: It spreads its cloud-white wings to fly; Its time hath come to it to die. God takes a wind from out the pines: It spreads its green-gloom wings, and shines Gold-green against the Rainbow-Signs. The weaving of the Sea is made Green, thus, with sacred pine-tree shade; White with cloud feathers overlaid. Forever thus the green is spun, The white across the surface run: This is the rune that I have won. This is the rune hath come to me Out of the mystery of the sea; When dreaming, where, far-off, may be The Rainbow-Pillars of Caershee. Cathair-Sith (pron. Caershee). In the Shadow. Oh, she will have the deep dark heart, for all her face is fair; As deep and dark as though beneath the shadow of her hair: For in her hair a spirit dwells that no white spirit is, And hell is in the hopeless heaven of that lost spirit's kiss. She has two men within the palm, the hollow of her hand: She takes their souls and blows them forth as idle drifted sand: And one falls back upon her breast that is his quiet home, And one goes out into the night and is as wind-blown foam. And when she sees the sleep of one, ofttimes she rises there And looks into the outer dark and calleth soft and fair: And then the lost soul that afar within the dark doth roam Comes laughing, laughing, laughing, and crying, Home! Home! And is there any home for him whose portion is the night? And is there any peace for him whose doom is endless flight? O wild sad bird, O wind-spent bird, O bird upon the wave There is no home for thee, wild bird, but in the cold sea-grave! The Green Lady. Wild fawn, wild fawn, Hast seen the Green Lady? The merles are singing, The ferns are springing, The little leaves whisper from dusk to dawnâ Green Lady! Green Lady! The little leaves whisper from dusk to dawnâ Wild fawn, wild fawn! Wild fawn, wild fawn, Hast seen the Green Lady? The bird in the nest, And the child at the breast, They open wide eyes as she comes down the dawnâ The bonnie Green Lady, Bird and child make a whisper of music at dawn, Wild fawn, wild fawn! Wild fawn, wild fawn, Dost thou flee the Green Lady? Her wild flowers will race thee, Her sunbeams will chase thee, Her laughter is ringing aloud in the dawnâ O the Green Lady With yellow flowers strewing the ways of the dawn, Wild fawn, wild fawn! A Milking Song. (Sweet St Bride.) Oh, sweet St Bride of the Yellow, yellow hair: Paul said, and Peter said, And all the saints alive or dead Vowed she had the sweetest head, Bonnie, sweet St Bride of the Yellow, yellow hair. White may my milking be, White as thee: Thy face is white, thy neck is white, Thy hands are white, thy feet are white, For thy sweet soul is shining brightâ O dear to me, O dear to see St Bridget white! Yellow may my butter be, Soft, and round: Thy breasts are sweet, Soft, round and sweet, So may my butter be: So may my butter be, O Bridget sweet! Safe thy way is, safe, O Safe, St Bride: May my kye come home at even, None be fallin', none be leavin', Dusky even, breath-sweet even, Here, as there, where, O St Bride, thou Keepest tryst with God in heav'n, Seest the angels bow And souls be shrivenâ Here, as there, 'tis breath-sweet even Far and wideâ Singeth thy little maid Safe in thy shade Bridget, Bride! A Milking Song. (Aillsha-bÃ n.) Aillsha-bÃ n, Aillsha-bÃ n, Give way to the milking! The Holy St Bridget Is milking, milking This self-same even The white kye in heavenâ Ay, sure, my eyes scan The green place she is in, Aillsha-bÃ n, Aillsha-bÃ n: And her hand is so soft And her crooning is sweet As my milking is soft Upon thee, Aillsha-bÃ nâ As my crooning is sweet Upon thee, Aillsha-bÃ n, Aillsha-bÃ nâ So soft is my hand and My crooning so sweet, Aillsha-bÃ n! St Bride's Warning. An O, an' O, St Bride's sweet song 'tis I am hearing, dearie, Dearie, dearie, dearie, my wee white babe that 's weary, Weary, weary, weary, with this my womb sae weary, And Bride's sweet song ye hear it too, and stir and sigh, my dearie! Oh, oh, lennavan-mo, Wee hands that give me pain and woe: Pain and woe, but be it so, 'Tis his dear self that now doth grow, Lennavan-mo, lennavan-mo, 'Tis his dear self one day you 'll know, Lennavan-mo, lennavan-mo! St Bridget dear, the cradle show, My baby comes, and I must go, Lennavan-mo, lennavan-mo! Arone!...ArÃ²! Arone!...ArÃ²! The Rainbow Bird. In the heart, a bird of sunshine Singeth a sweet song: None can do it wrong Sweet breath of sunshine! What is this sunny bird With the rainbow-wings, That singeth of secret things The heart only hath heard? I know not: but lo The sun shines, and far, In the blue sky a star Leapeth white as snow. And when the night-tides flow And the stars glisten In the dark, I listen, And the bird of moonshine Sings, where erst The sun-song burst From the bird of sunshine. A Summer Air. O waving trees, And waving wind, And waving seas, And waving mindâ Where, far and wide, Am I to roam To find my bride, To reach my home? My soul is my bride: Ah, whither fled? She hath not died, Nor am I dead: But somehow, somewhere, A song she heard, And she flashed thro' the air A sunfire bird. My bride, she is Where the rainbows are; Sweet, sweet her kiss Awaits afar: My goal is where The sea-waves meet The Sands of Youth Stirred by her feet. O waving leaves, O waving grass, My heart grieves That it may not pass. âSummer is fleet, Summer is long,ââ I know not, Sweet, 'Tis an empty Song. Where, far and wide, Across what foam, On what strange tide, Shall I be come? Meet me, O Bride, Where, lost, I roam: Leap to my side And lead me home! The Hollow Land. Through the Hollow Land I wandered On the silent wings of Sleep: And the darkness was about me As the furtive things that creep From the shadow of the forest Round the Shadow still more deep. On a dark wing I was lifted And was borne beyond the Gate, Past the Portals of two Shadows Which are the self-same Fate,â Sleep, clad in dusk, and dreaming, Death, clad in night, her Mate. And so thence across the valley Where unborn things agleam Shine wanly athwart the gloaming Beside each undreamed dream, Till the Hollow Land was entered By a silent stream. The River of Oblivion It was that wended there, Till lost in the immensity Of that unwinnowed air: Yet onward, and as for ever, My soul was borne there. O soul, that thing which was uttered, O soul, that thing which thou saw, What memory hast thou of either Though thrilling still with the aweâ Not more than of harvest lingers In wind-whirled straw! Yet, soul, in the shadowy silence That clothes thee round about, Thou knowest thou viewed vast armies In fierce bewildered rout, And, 'mid the seething clamour, Heard, as a blast, thy shout! O soul, wast thou a victor Or led'st thou a failing host: Or were thy banners flying Along a dismal coast: Wert thou crown'd with life, O spirit, Or crown'd with death, poor ghost? The Sorrow of Delight. Till death be filled with darkness And life be filled with light, The Sorrow of ancient sorrows Shall be the sorrow of Night: But then the Sorrow of Sorrows Shall be the Sorrow of Delight. Heart's-joy must fade with sorrow, For both are sprung from clay: But the Joy that is one with Sorrow, Treads an immortal way: Each hath in fee To-morrow, And their soul is Yesterday. Joy that is clothed with shadow Is the joy that is not dead: For the joy that is clothed with the rainbow Shall with the bow be sped: Where the Sun spends his fires is she, And where the Stars are led. The Stone of Sorrow. Wearily dawns the morning o'er the world. The sea, muttering, moans his primeval pain. The brooding mists upon the brooding hills are lain; The banners of the wild wandering mountain-winds are furled: Wearily, wearily, dawns the morning o'er the world. O wearily dawns this morning of the world. Beautiful spirit, whither hast thou fled? They tell me thou art here no more, that thou art dead: That shall not be till God afar the sun and stars hath whirled, And saith, So sets the last wild dawn of any world. FOAM OF THE PAST The Moon-Song of Cathal. O yellow lamp of Ioua that is having a cold pale flame there, Put thy honey-sheen upon me who am close-caverned with Death: Sure it is little I see now who have seen too much and too little: O moon, thy breast is softer and whiter than hers who burneth the day. Put thy white light on the grave where the dead man my father is, And waken him, waken him, wake! And put thy soft shining on the breast of the woman my mother, So that she stir in her sleep and say to the viking beside her, âTake up thy sword, and let it lap blood, for it thirsts with long thirst.â And O Ioua, be as the sea-calm upon the hot heart of Ardanna, the girl: Tell her that Cathal loves her, and that memory is sweeter than life. I list her heart beating here in the dark and the silence, And it is not lonely I am, because of that, and remembrance. O yellow flame of Ioua, be a spilling of blood out of the heart of Ecta, So that he fall dead, inglorious, slain from within, as a greybeard; And light a fire in the brain of Molios, so that he shall go moonstruck, And men will jeer at him, and he will die at the last, idly laughing! For lo, I worship thee, Ioua; and if thou canst give my message to Neis,â Neis the helot out of Iondu, that is in Iona, bondman to Colum,â Tell him I hail thee as Bandia, as god-queen and mighty, And that he had the wisdom and I was a fool with trickling ears of moss. But grant me this, O goddess, a bitter moon-drinking for Colum! May he have the moonsong in his brain, and in his heart the moonfire: Flame take him to heart of flame, and may he wane as wax at the furnace, And his soul drown in tears, and his body be a nothingness upon the sands! The Sun-Chant of Cathal. O hot yellow fire that streams out of the sky, sword-white and golden, Be a flame upon the monks that are praying in their cells in Iona! Be a fire in the veins of Colum, and the hell that he preacheth be his, And be a torch to the men of Lochlin that they discover the isle and consume it! For I see this thing, that the old gods are the gods that die not: All else is a seeming, a dream, a madness, a tide ever ebbing. Glory to thee, O Grian, lord of life, first of the gods, Allfather, Swords and spears are thy beams, thy breath a fire that consumeth! And upon this isle of A-rinn send sorrow and death and disaster, Upon one and all save Ardanna, who gave me her bosom, Upon one and all send death, the curse of a death slow and swordless, From Molios of the Cave to MÃ»rta and Diarmid my doomsmen! War-Chant of the Islesmen. O'tis a good song the sea makes when blood is on the wave, And a good song the wave makes when its crest o'foam is red! For the rovers out of Lochlin the sea is a good grave, And the bards will sing to-night to the sea-moan of the dead! Yo-hoâa-h'eilyâa-yo, eily, ayah, a yo! Sword and Spear and Battle-Axe sing the Song of Woe: Ayah, eily, a yo! Eily, ayah, a yo! The Laughter of the Sword. Oh 'tis a good thing the red blood, by Odin his word! And a good thing it is to hear it bubbling deep. And when we hear the laughter of the Sword, Oh, the corbies croak, and the old wail, and the women weep! And busy will she be there where she stands, Washing the red out of the sins of all this slaying horde; And trampling the bones of them into white powdery sands, And laughing low at the thirst of her thirsty swordâ The Washer of the Ford! The Death Shadow. Oh, death of Fergus, that is lying in the boat here, Betwixt the man of the red hair and him of the black beard, Rise now, and out of thy cold white eyes take out the fear, And let Fergus mac Art mhic Fheargus see his weird! Sure, now, it's a blind man I am, but I'm thinking I see The shadow of you crawling across the dead. Soon you will twine your arm around his shaking knee, And be whispering your silence into his listless head. The Ford of Death. Where the winds gather The souls of the dead, O Torcall, my father, My soul is led! In Hildyr-mead I was thrown, I was sown: Out of thy seed I am sprung, I am blown! But where is the way For Hildyr and me, By the hill-moss grey Or the grey sea? For a river is here, And a whirling Swordâ And a Woman washing By a Ford! The Washer of Souls. Glory to the great Gods, it is no Sword I am seeing: Nor do I see aught but the flowing of a river. And I see shadows on the flow that are ever fleeing, And I see a Woman washing shrouds for ever and ever. âGlory to God on high, and to Mary, Mother of Jesus, Here am I washing away the sins of the shriven, O Torcall of Lochlin, throw off the red sins that ye cherish And I will be giving you the washen shroud that they wear in Heaven.â O well it is I am seeing, Woman of the Shrouds, That you have not for me any whirling of the Sword: I have lost my gods, O woman, so what will the name be Of thee and thy gods, O woman that art Washer of the Ford? âIt is Mary Magdalene my name is, and I loved Christ, And Christ is the Son of God, and of Mary the Mother of Heaven. And this river is the river of death, and the shadows Are the fleeing souls that are lost if they be not shriven.â LYRIC RUNES âMy wisdom became pregnant on lonely mountains; upon rugged stones she bore her young. Now she runneth strangely through the hard desert and seeketh, and ever seeketh for soft grass, mine own old wisdom.â Nietzsche. The Faring of the Tide. âO father, Son, and Holy Spirit, Be the Three-in-one with us day and night, On the crested wave, when waves run high!â Out of the place in the West Where Tir-na'n-Ãg, the Land of Youth Is, the Land of Youth everlasting, Send the great tide that carries the sea-weed And brings the birds, out of the North: And bid it wind as a snake through the bracken, As a great snake through the heather of the sea, The fair blooming heather of the sunlit sea. And may it bring the fish to our nets, And the great fish to our lines: And may it sweep away the sea-hounds That devour the herring: And may it drown the heavy pollack That respect not our nets But fall into and tear them and ruin them wholly. And may I, or any that is of my blood, Behold not the Wave-Haunter who comes in with the Tide; Or the Maighdeann-mÃ ra who broods in the shallows, Where the sea-caves are, in the ebb. And fair may my fishing be, and the fishing of those near to me, And good may this Tide be, and good may it bring: And may there be no calling in the Flow, this SrÃ¹th-mÃ ra, And may there be no burden in the ebb! ochone! The Rune of the Black Seal. Ho, ro, O black Seal, O black Seal! In the name of the Father, And of the Son, And of the Holy Ghost, O Seal of the deep sea, O black Seal! Hearken the thing that I say to thee, I, Phadric MacAlastair MhicCrae, Who dwells in a house on the Island That you look on night and day from Soa! For I put rosad upon thee, And upon the woman-seal that won thee, And the women-seal that are thine, And the young that thou hast; Ay, upon thee and all thy kin I put rosad, O Ron dubh, O Ron-Ã -mhÃ ra! And may no harm come to me or mine, Or to any fishing or snaring that is of me; Or to any sailing by storm or dusk, Or when the moonshine fills the blind eyes of the dead, No harm to me or mine From thee or thine! The Rune of MÃ nus MacCodrum. It is I, MÃ nus MacCodrum, I am telling you that, you, Anndra of my blood, And you, Neil my grandfather, and you, and you, and you! Ay, ay, MÃ nus my name is, MÃ nus MacMÃ nus! It is I myself, and no other, Your brother, O Seals of the Sea! Give me blood of the red fish, And a bite of the flying sgadan: The green wave on my belly, And the foam in my eyes! I am your bull-brother, O Bulls of the Sea, Bull-better than any of you, snarling bulls! Come to me, mate, seal of the soft furry womb, White am I still, though red shall I be, Red with the streaming red blood if any dispute me! Aoh, aoh, aoh, arÃ², ho-rÃ²! A man was I, a seal am I, My fangs churn the yellow foam from my lips: Give way to me, give way to me, Seals of the Sea; Give way, for I am fÃ«y of the sea And the sea-maiden I see there, And my name, true, is MÃ nus MacCodrum, The bull-seal that was a man, ArÃ ! ArÃ ! The moment is that where MÃ nus, the Seal-Man, plunges into the sea and hails the seals as his blood-kindred. (âThe Sin-Eaterâ: p. 204.) The Spell of the Sight. By that which dwells within thee, By the lamps that shine upon me, By the white light I see litten From the brain now sleeping stilly, By the silence in the hollows, By the wind that slow subsideth, By the life-tide slowly ebbing, By the death-tide slowly rising, By the slowly waning warmth, By the chill that slowly groweth, By the dusk that slowly creepeth, By the darkness near thee, By the darkness round thee, By the darkness o'er theeâ O'er thee, round thee, on theeâ By the one that standeth At thy side and waiteth Dumb and deaf and blindly, By the one that moveth, Bendeth, riseth, watcheth, By the dim Grave-Spell upon thee, By the Silence thou hast wedded.... May the way thy feet are treading, May the tangled lines now crookÃ¨d, Clear as moonlight lie before me! Oh! oh! ohrone, ochrone! green the branches bonnie: Oh! oh! ohrone, ochrone! red the blood-drop berries: Achrone, arone, arone, arone, I see the green-clad Lady, She walks the road that's wet with tears, with rustling sorrows shady... Oh! oh! mo ghraidh, Mo ghraidh, mo ghraidh! THE LOVE SONGS OF IAN MÃR Alona. Thou art the Daughter of the Sun, Alona! Even as the sun in a green place, The light that is upon thy face! When thou art gone there is dusk on my ways, Alona! Thy soul is of sun-fire wrought in clay, Alona, The white warm clay that hath for name, Alonaâand for word of fame, Eilidhâand is for me a Flame To burn against the Eternal Day, Alona! The hills know thee, and the green woods, Alona, And the wide sea, and the blue loch, and the stream: On thy brow, Daughter of the Sun, is agleam The mystery of Dream,â Alona! The fires of the sun that burn thee, Alona, O, heart of my heart, are in me! Thy fire burns, thy flame killeth, thy sea Of light blazeth continuallyâ Is there no rest in joy, no rest, no rest for me Whom rapture slayeth utterly, Alona, Alona! Alona is the Anglicised form of an old Gaelic word signifying âexquisitely beautiful.â The name Eilidh used here and throughout the following poems is pronounced Eily (Isle-Ã®h). Eilidh. Come to my life that is already yours, and at one with you: Come to my blood that leaps because of you, Come to my heart that holds you, Eilidh, Come to my heart that holds you as the green earth clasps and holds the sunlight, Come to me! Come to me, Eilidh! Silk o' the Kine. Eilidh, Eilidh, heart of my life, my pulse, my flame, There are two men loving thee and two who are calling thee wife: But only one husband to thee, Eilidh, that art my wife, and my joy; Ay, sure, thy womb knows me, and the child thou bearest is mine. Thou to me, I to thee, there is nought else in the world, Eilidh Silk o'the Kine; Nought else in the world, no, no other man for thee, no woman for me! Eilidh, my Fawn. O far away upon the hills at the lighting of the dawn I saw a stirring in the fern and out there leapt a fawn: And O my heart was up at that and like the wind it blew Till its shadow hovered o'er the fawn as 'mid the fern it flew. And Eilidh! Eilidh! Eilidh! was the wind song on the hill, And Eilidh! Eilidh! Eilidh! did the echoing corries fill: My hunting heart was glad indeed, at the lighting of the dawn, For O it was the hunting then of my bonnie bonnie Fawn! Love in Absence. âAnd dost thou love me not a whit the less: And is thy heart as tremulous as of yore, And do thine eyes mirror the wonderfulness, And do thy lips retain their magic lore?â What, Sweet, can these things be, ev'n in thy thought, And I so briefly gone, so swiftly come? Nay, if the pulse of life its beat forgot This speaking heart would not thereby be dumb. I love thee, love thee so, O beautiful Hell That dost consume heart, brain, nerves, body, soul, That even my immortal birthright I would sell Were Heaven to choose, or Thee, as my one goal. Sweet love fulfilled, they say, the common lot! He, who speaks thus, of real love knoweth not! The Closing Doors. Eilidh, Eilidh, Eilidh, heart of me, dear and sweet! In dreams I am hearing the whisper, the sound of your coming feet: The sound of your coming feet that like the sea-hoofs beat A music by day and night, Eilidh, on the sands of my heart, my sweet! O sands of my heart, what wind moans low along thy shadowy shore? Is that the deep sea-heart I hear with the dying sob at its core? Each dim lost wave that lapses is like a closing door: 'Tis closing doors they hear at last who soon shall hear no more, Who soon shall hear no more. Eilidh, Eilidh, Eilidh, come home, come home to the heart o'me: It is pain I am having ever, Eilidh, a pain that will not be: Come home, come home, for closing doors are as the waves o'the sea, Once closed they are closed for ever, Eilidh, lost, lost, for thee and me, Lost, lost, for thee and me. Home. O heart that is breaking, Breaking, breaking: O for the home that I canna, canna win! The weary aching, The weary, weary aching To be in the home that I canna, canna win! For O the long home sickness, The long, long home sickness! 'Tis slow, slow death for me who longs for home, for home! And a heart is breaking, I know a heart that's breaking, All to be at home at last, to be at home, at home, O Eilidh, Eilidh, Home, Home, Home! FROM THE HEART OF A WOMAN âPraised be the fathomless universe, For life and joy...and for love, sweet love.â Walt Whitman. âA secret vision in our soul will hallow life.â An Inscription. Green Fire of Joy, Green Fire of Life, Be with you thro' the Stress and Strifeâ Be with you thro' the Shadow and Shine, The immortal Ichor, the immortal Wine. Drink deep of the immortal Wine, It gives the laughter to the Strife, Drink deep, and thro' the Shadow and Shine Rejoice in the Green Fire of Life. Pulse of my Heart. Are these your eyes, Ian, That look into mine? Is this smile, this laugh, Thine? Heart of me, dear, O pulse of my heart, This is our child, our childâ And...we apart! Wrought of thy life, Ian, Wrought in my womb, Never to feel thy kiss!â Ah, bitter doom! Live, live, thou laughing boy, We meet again! Here do we part, we twain: I to my death-sweet pain, Thou to thy span of joy. Hush, hush: within thine eyes His eyes I see. Sure, death is Paradise If so my soul can be, Ian, with thee! My Birdeen. Oh bonnie birdeen, Sweet bird of my heartâ Tell me, O tell me, How shall we part? He calls me, he cries, Who is father to thee: O birdeen, his eyes In these blue eyes I see. Thou art wrought of our joy, Of our joy that was slain: My birdeen, my boy, My passion, my pain. THE SILENCE OF AMOR âAre they gone, these twain, who loved with deathless love? Or is this a dream that I have dreamed? âAfar in an island-sanctuary that I shall not see again, where the wind chants the blind oblivious rune of Time, I have heard the grasses whisper: Time never was, Time is not.â âUla and Urla.â TO ESCLARMOUNDO. The Shadowy Woodlands. Above the shadowy woodlands I hear the voice of the cuckoo Above the shadowy woodlands I hear the voice of the cuckoo, sailing like a silver skiff upon the moonflood. I hear the far-off plaint of the cuckoo sink deep through the moonshine above the shadowy woodlands. At last, in the dense shadow of the wood, the moonlight sleeps. At the Rising of the Moon. At the rising of the moon At the rising of the moon I heard the falling echo of a song, down by the linn where the wild-brier hangs over the swirling foam. Ah swirling foam, ah poignant breath of the wild brier, now that I hear no haunting-sweet echo of a falling song at the rising of the moon. Nocturne. By dim, mauve and dream-white bushes of lilac By dim, mauve and dream-white bushes of lilac I pass to the cypress alley, and to the mere which lies breathless in the moonshine. A fish leaps, a momentary flame of fire. Then all is still again on the moonlit mere, where, breathless, it lies beyond the cypress alley. In the vague moonshine of the cypress alley I pass again, a silent shadow, by the dim, mauve and dream-white bushes of lilac. Lances of Gold. The afternoon has drowsed through the sun-flood. The afternoon has drowsed through the sun-flood. The green leaves have grown golden, saturated with light. And now, at the sudden whirling of the lances of gold, a cloud of wild-doves arises from the pines, wheels against the sunblaze, and flashes out of sight, flames of purple and rose, of foam-white and pink. I know the green hidden nests of the wild doves, when ye come again, O whirling lances of gold! The Nightjar. Low upon a pine-branch a nightjar leans Low upon a pine-branch a nightjar leans and sings his churring song. He sings his churring song to his mate, who, poised upon a juniper hard by, listens with quivering wings. The whirring of the nightjar fills the dusk, heavy with the fragrance of new-mown hay. There is neither star nor moon in the dim, flowing darkness, only the red and yellow wayfaring flames where the glow-worms are. Like a wandering wave, in the dewy dark, the churring note of the nightjar rises and falls against the juniper bush hard by. The Twilit Waters. Upon the dim seas in the twilight Upon the dim seas in the twilight I hear the tide forging slowly through the still waters. There is not a sound else: neither the scream of a sea-mew, nor the harsh cry of the heron, nor the idle song of the wind: only the steadfast forging of the tide through the still waters of the twilit seas. O steadfast onward tide, O gloaming-hidden palpitating seas! EvoÃ«! Oceanward, the sea-horses sweep magnificently Oceanward, the sea-horses sweep magnificently, champing and whirling white foam about their green flanks, and tossing on high their manes of sunlit rainbow-gold, dazzling white and multitudinous far as sight can reach. O champing horses of my soul, toss, toss on high your sunlit manes, your manes of rainbow-gold, dazzling white and multitudinous: for I too rejoice, rejoice! Grey and Rose. I watched the greying of the dawn I watched the greying of the dawn suspiring into rose. Then a yellow ripple came out of the narrow corrie at the summit of the hill. The yellow ripple ran like the running tide through the flushing grey, and washed in among the sprays of a birch beside me and among the rowan-clusters of a mountain-ash. But at the falling of the sun the yellow ripple was an ebbing tide, and the sprays of the birch were as a perishing flame and the rowan-berries were red as drops of blood. Thereafter I watched the rose slow fading into the grey veils of dusk. O greying of my dawn suspiring into rose: O grey veils of dusk that obscure the tender flushing of my rose-lit dawn! High Noon. To-day, as I walked at high noon To-day, as I walked at high noon, listening to the larks filling the April blue with a spray of delicate song, I saw a shadow pass me, where no one was, and where nothing moved, above me or around. It was not my shadow that passed me, nor the shadow of one for whom I longed. That other shadow came not. I have heard that there is a god clothed in shadow who goes to and fro among the human kind, putting silence between hearts with his waving hands, and breathing a chill out of his cold breath, and leaving a gulf as of deep waters flowing between them because of the passing of his feet. Thus, thus it was that that other shadow for which I longed came not. Yet, in the April blue I heard the wild aerial chimes of song, and watched the golden fulfilment of the day under the high illimitable arch of noon. The White Merle. Long, long ago, a white merle flew out of Eden. Long, long ago, a white merle flew out of Eden. Its song has been in the world ever since, but few there are who have seen the flash of its white wings through the green-gloom of the living woodâthe sun-splashed, rain-drenched, mist-girt, storm-beat wood of human life. But to-day, as I came through the wood, under an arch of tempest, and led by lightnings, I passed into a green sun-splashed place. There, there, I heard the singing of a rapt song of joy! there, ah there I saw the flash of white wings! The Immortals. I saw the Weaver of Dream I saw the Weaver of Dream, an immortal shape of star-eyed Silence; and the Weaver of Death, a lovely Dusk with a heart of hidden flame: and each wove with the shuttles of Beauty and Wonder and Mystery. I knew not which was the more fair: for Death seemed to me as Love, and in the eyes of Dream I saw Joy. Oh, come, come to me, Weaver of Dream! Come, come unto me, O Lovely Dusk, thou that hast the heart of hidden flame! The Weaver of Hope. Again I saw a beautiful lordly one. Again I saw a beautiful lordly one. He too lifted the three shuttles of Beauty and Wonder and Mystery, and wove a mist of rainbows. Rainbow after rainbow he wrought out of the mist of glory that he made, and sent each forth to drift across the desert of the human soul, and o'er every haunted valley of defeated dreams. O drifting rainbows of Hope, I know a pale place, a haunted valley of defeated dreams. The Golden Tides. The moon lay low above the sea The moon lay low above the sea, and all the flowing gold and flashing silver of the rippling running water seemed to be a flood going that way and falling into the shining hollow of the moon. O, that the tides of my heart, for ever flowing one way, might fall to rest in the hollow of a golden moon. Nocturne. A pale golden flame illumes A pale golden flame illumes the suspended billows of the forest. Star after star emerges, where the moongold laps the velvet-soft shores of dusk. Slowly the yellowing flame arises like smoke among the dark-blue depths. The white rays of the stars wander over the moveless, over the shadowless and breathless green lawns of the tree-tops. O would that I were a star lost deep within the paling yellow flame that illumes the suspended billows of the forest. The Reed Player. I saw one that put a hollow reed to his lips I saw one put a hollow reed to his lips. It was a forlorn, sweet air that he played, an ancient forgotten strain learned of a shepherding woman upon the hills. The Song of Songs it was that he played: and the beating of hearts was heard, and I heard sighs, and a voice like a distant bird-song rose and fell. âPlay me a song of Death,â I said. Then he who had the hollow reed at his lips smiled, and he played again the Song of Songs. Hy BrÃ sil. I heard the voice of the wind among the pines. I heard the voice of the wind among the pines. It was as the tide coming over smooth sands. On the red pine-boles the sun flamed goldenly out of the west. In falling cadences the cuckoos called across the tides of light. In dreams, now, I hear the cuckoos calling across a dim sea of light, there where a sun that never rose nor set flames goldenly upon ancient trees, in whose midst the wind goes sighingly, with a sound as of the tide slipping swift over smooth sands. And I hear a solitary voice singing there, where I stand beside the gold-flamed pine-boles and look with hungry eyes against the light of a sun that never rose nor set. The Wild Bees. There was a man, seeking Peace There was a man, seeking Peace, who found a precious treasure in the heather, when the bells were sweet with honey-ooze. Did the wild bees know of it? Would that I could hear the soft hum of their gauzy wings. Where blooms that heather, and what wind is it that moveth the bells that are sweet with the honey-ooze? Only the wild bees know of it; but I think they must be the bees of Magh-Mell, the bees that make a sweet sound in the drowsy ears of those who beneath the heather have indeed found rest by the dim waysides of Peace. Whirled Stars. The rain has ceased falling softly The rain has ceased falling softly through the dusk. A cool green wind flows through the deeps of air. The stars are as wind-whirled fruit blown upward from the tree-tops. Full-orbed, and with a pulse of flame, the moon leads a tide of quiet light over the brown shores of the world. But here, here where I stand upon the brown shores of the world, in the shine of that quiet flame where, full-orbed, the moon uplifts the dark, I think only of the stars as wind-whirled fruit blown upward from the tree-tops. I think only of that wind that blew upon the tree-tops, where the whirling stars spun in a mazy dance, when, at last, the rain had ceased falling softly through the dusk. O wind-whirled stars, O secret falling rain! Orchil. I dreamed of Orchil I dreamed of Orchil, the dim goddess who is under the brown earth, in a vast cavern, where she weaves at two looms. With one hand she weaves life upward through the grass; with the other she weaves death downward through the mould: and the sound of the weaving is Eternity, and the name of it in the green world is Time. And, through all, Orchil weaves the weft of Eternal Beauty, that passeth not, though its soul is Change. This is my comfort, O Beauty that art of Time, who am faint and hopeless in the strong sound of that other Weaving, where Orchil, the dim goddess, sits dreaming at her loom under the brown earth. Fuit Ilium. I see the lift of the dark I see the lift of the dark, the lovely advance of the lunar twilight, the miracle of the yellow bloomâgolden here and here white as frost-fireâupon sea and land. I see, and yet see not. I hear the muffled voice of ocean and soft recurrent whisperings of the foam-white runnels at my feet: I hear, and yet hear not. But one sound, one voice, I hear: one gleam, one vision, I see: O irrevocable, ineffable Desire! The Sea Shell. In the heart of the shell In the heart of the shell a wild-rose flush lies shut from wind or wave; lies close, and dreams to the unceasing lullaby that the sea-shell sings. O would that I were that wild-rose flush, shut close from wind or wave: O would that I were that wild-rose flush to dream for ever to the unceasing song my sea-shell sings. The White Procession. One by one the stars come forth One by one the stars come forthâsolemn eyes watching for ever the white procession move onward orderly where there is neither height, nor depth, nor beginning, nor end. In the vast stellar space the moonglow wanes until it grows cold, white, ineffably remote. Only upon our little dusky earth, upon our restless span of waters, the light descends in a tender warmth. Deep gladness to me, though but the creature of an hour, that I am on this little moonlit dusky earth. Too cold, too white, too ineffably remote the moonglow in these vast wastes of Infinity where, one by one, the constellations roamâsolemn witnesses watching for ever the white procession move onward orderly where there is neither height, nor depth, nor beginning, nor end. The Two Eternities. Time never was, Time is not. Time never was, Time is not. Thus I heard the grasses whisper, the green lips of the wind that chants the blind oblivious rune of Time, far in that island-sanctuary that I shall not see again. Time never was, Time is not. O Time that was! O Time that is! The Hills of Dream. The tide of noon is upon the hills. The tide of noon is upon the hills. Amid leagues of purple heather, of pale amethyst ling, stand isled great yellow-lichened granite boulders, fringed with tawny bracken. In the vast dome of blue there is nought visible save a speck of white, a gannet that drifts above the invisible sea. And through the hot tide of noon goes a breath as of the heart of flame. Far off, far off, I know dim hills of dream, and there my heart suspends as a white bird longing for home: and there, oh there, is a heart of flame, and the breath of it is as the tide of noon upon these hills of dream. Aerial Chimes. Through the blue deeps of noon I heard Through the blue deeps of noon I heard the cuckoo tolling his infrequent peals from skiey belfries built of sun and mist. And now, through the blue deeps of night, from skiey belfries built of dusk and stars, I hear the tolling of infrequent peals. Explicit</field>
