      <field name="fulltext">PROVIDENCE: OR, ARANDUS and EMILEC. A POEM. Me verÃ² primum dulces ante omnia MusÃ¦, Quarum sacra fero ingenti percussus amore, Accipiant; cÃ¦lique vias ac sidera monstrent. Virg. Let others sing the foibles and the charms Of Womankind; and, with luxuriant wit Adorning the dear theme, ensure success: A theme dear to the Muse, when smiling Fate Thro' wood and vale leads on the chearful Youth, Who knows nor fear nor care: but these are mine, And long have beenâAnother Song, my Muse, Befits thy voice; the dark mysterious ways Of Providence, an awful search, be thine.â Far in the East, beyond where Indus rolls His copious waves, secluded from the world, Among the mountains of Imaus, live Some harmless Shepherds of the Magi School. Here, in her primitive simplicity, Pure Nature reigns; the Arts, and all their train Of polished Vices, utter strangers here. Each morning, with the rising Sun, they meet, And hail him type of the eternal God; Then, in a willing chorus, raise the voice To their immortal Father, and implore His benediction: By the fount or shade, Tending their flocks, they sing their constant loves, Their Fathers eulogies, and varying year. Now dance and rural sport engage the Youth; The Old look on with joy, and to their minds Recall their youthful feats.âBut now no more Emilec join'd; he, who was wont to lead The song and dance: The blushes of the rose Had left his cheek; dull roll'd his languid eye, So keen before: All by the desart rocks He pass'd the weary day; and when the Moon Glimps'd pale along the glade, when Wolf and Fox Roam forth in quest of some stray'd Lamb or Ewe, He wander'd by the murm'ring brook alone, Mourning his Caia, and his woful fate. 'Twas now the noon of Night, and all was still, And Flock and Shepherd shar'd the balmy sweets Of soundest Sleep, nor dream'd but of a fair And joyful morning. Then Emilec too, Quite spent with sorrow, slept; but still his soul Follow'd his Caia. On a bank, he thought, He mourning lay; when, clad in purest white, Glowing with joy, his lovely Bride appear'd, And gently thus: Lo, I am here, my Love; I am return'd, my Love, am safe return'd. My Joy, my Undefil'd! he cried, and sprang To embrace; but awoke, and all was dark, Dark and aloneâforth burst the ready sigh, And fell the tear. Then wand'ring out, to vent His anguish; thro' a winding path, o'erhung With rocks and barren shrubs, he sought the vale Where rest the Dead; still, as he went along, Calling on Caia: Oh return, my Love!â Why went'st thou to the distant hill alone? The Russians seiz'd thee thereâAlas! methinks I hear thee call Emilec to thy aid: But none to aid thee comesâSome hated Wretch, Quite drunk with lustâAh Heav'n!âand must thou be Basely polluted?âNoâAs Heav'n is just It cannot curse thee so. Ay, now at peace, Thou liest in Death's cold armsâO never more To be the charge of mine!âYes, I shall soon Rest in the peaceful graveâNature to me Has joys no moreâall dreadful is the day, And horrid is the night. Thus as he spoke, The good Arandus heard; for oft, when shone The ocean of the sky with living fires, What time the Pleias shew their wat'ry train In middle heav'n, the venerable Sage, Wand'ring among the wilds, would glow with high Enthusiasm divine: He heard the voice Of lov'd Emilecânow no more, as wont, With sounds of lively joy, but, dire reverse, Expressive of the bitterness of woe. He follow'd, unobserv'd; and now arriv'd Among the moss-clad tombs, the mournful Youth Down stretch'd him on his Sire'sâand all around Was silent as the grave; save from afar The roaring of the Ganges, thro' the hills, Died in faint echoes: Thus the Wand'rer oft, Benighted in some lone Italian wood, With awe hears from afar the midnight Mass. The horny Moon shone forth; the spacious vault Of heav'n all glow'd with Stars that went their rounds, In deep eternal silence, and on earth Shed a dim holy light. Then with a sigh Emilec thus beganâThen farewel Hopeâ A long adieu to Joyâlet Sorrow come, Eternal Melancholy be thou mine: Thy deepest gloom can never never add One horror to my breastâThe depths of Woe, Where worse can never come, is all the wish Of my poor heart, which now in black Despair Takes up its refuge. Yet, oh what a change! Oh lost Emilec! thou wert once the hope And joy of thy fond Parents.âFair indeed Thy morning sun arose, and ev'ry day Promis'd long happiness; on ev'ry side Deceitful Fortune smil'd; no foolish wish Of wealth or honour, ever broke my rest; No passion led me, and no fears appall'd. But ah! the dreadful end! Is this, O Heav'n! The issue of my Parents vows and hopes? Alas! was all my former Joy, that I Might feel more piercingly my wretched fall? My Caia is defil'd!âOh, shocking thought! And mine no more!âHeav'n cannot to my arms Restore her pure!âHeav'n cannot to my breast Restore my former calm; dull shines the sun, All Nature wears a sickly gloom to me; The ghastly grave alone can give me rest: Oh that eternal Darkness seal'd my eyes, And Death's cold hand compos'd this troubl'd breast! Arandus now approach'd; a sudden dread Surpriz'd Emilec, while with kind intent The Sage began: Alas! why thus, my Son, Driv'n on by fury, and that fiend Despair? Summon thy Reason: Reason was ordain'd By the eternal Sire to be our guide; And when we disobey, 'tis yonder Heav'n That holds us rebels: but her voice is low, And very slow her speech; the young and vain Or hear her not, or hear but part; the Calm Alone can understand her heav'nly voice. When Man goes hence, when o'er the silent Dead The wild flow'rs of the field spring forth, the Mind, Unfetter'd, then receives the just reward Of ev'ry action: and, if Heav'n its lot, Among the Sons of God, from joy to joy For ever shall advance. Then, if it bore The miseries of life with patient heart And meek submission to the Will Supreme, Sublime its joy shall be. Attend, my Son, And let this awful truth sink to thy heart: False is the heart of Man, false to itself, When sweet Prosperity smiles all around: Intoxicated with the pleasing cup, Proud, hard, and selfish, it becomes; the voice Of Mis'ry is but faintly heard; and God Is quite forgot, or with a cold regard Remember'd, if at all: But as the fire Refines the silver; so a taste of woe Awakes the Soul. Below the adverse tide The little Mind is sunk; but the great Soul With heav'nly lustre shines thro' the black cloud Of dread Adversity, and great at last Finds herself happy, and contemns her woes. O tell me not of Peace, Emilec cry'd; A heated fancy may, in pain and death, Deceive itself into an extacy Of joy imagin'dâand O happy he Of such delirium! But my heart is struck Beyond the pow'r of Fancy to relieve. All, all is vanityâPoor Man is born The heir of woe; the mornings of his years Are gay, and promise high; a thousand forms Of happiness inchant his thoughtless heart; And all seems very nearâpleas'd with the dream, He laughs, he joys. So, with a lightsome heart, The little Linnet on the hawthorn sings, Unconscious of the net that soon shall end Its joy. So poor deluded Man goes on, 'Till soon some of the fierce unnumber'd ills That haunt the human race, burst on his head: Then all his former joys appear no more But as a broken ill-remember'd dream. Yet still the giddy wretch will fondly hope, His state no surer, and his hope as vain As the wreck'd Mariner's, who rides the surge On a bare plank: his wishful eyes look round, And if a thin blue vapour hovers o'er The deep, he thinks it land, and cheers his heart; Then sinks among the Dead. But why, O Heav'n! Why must th' immortal mind of Man, that boasts Such glorious pow'rsâwhy must it be the sport Of ev'ry adverse blast? Thick darkness veils The mighty secretâfar, oh far it lies From human search; deep as the center hid: Dark are the ways of Heav'n; o'er ev'ry part Of human life a horrid darkness broods.â No God regards the JustâThro' streams of blood And orphans tears, their neighbours wealth some seize, Enjoy it freely, and, in good old age, Go to the grave in peace. While I have seen, Young as I am,âand oh, I feel it too, The Just go mourning thro' the extremes of woe; Their sickly souls each word of comfort hate, And grief, obdurate grief, o'erwhelms their mind. Life has no joys, and earth no rest for me. I look'd for good, but woe succeeded woeâ My Parents dieâyoung and unskill'd in life, They leave me to the worldâYet still I hop'd: My fields are blasted, and my flocks destroy'd: Yet still I hop'd. But now, my fatal sum, My miseries are compleatâthen farewel Hope; Farewel the sweet delusions of a kind And righteous Providenceâ'Tis Death alone Is all my hope, my cureâyes, I shall soon Rest with the Dead, the sport of woe no more. To whom Arandus thus: Yet, O my Son, Attend this truth; 'Tis trial shews the Man. This dire adversity, my Son, is thine; Bear like a Man, and never let thy lips Thy Maker or his Providence blaspheme. Shalt thou, whose narrow views reach but a part, A very small part of the dreadful ways Of the eternal Oneâshalt thou presume, Blind Son of Dust, poor Being of a Day, T'arraign th' Almighty, and correct the God Of all perfection? Poor short-sighted Man Should, silent in the dust, adore the hand Of Providence; and take th' imbittered cup With meek submission, tho' he cannot know Why so design'd. God is the Sire of all, And he chastises theeâSay, shall the boy Who obstinately spurns the rod, or he Who, all-submiss, with weeping eyes implores His Father's mercy, surest gain his love. Perhaps just now, Heav'n's kind paternal hand Is doing more for thee, than ev'n thy soul Dares to desireâthen how thy heart must burn With shame and anguish to review thy thoughts. Great are thy woes indeedâbut why, my Son, Why black Despair? and why the filial trust In God, not thine? To trust the tender care Of the Almighty Father, gives the Soul, In the most dread distress, a delicate And melancholy joy, sublime above The Drunkard's laughter, and the sensual wish. Exert the Man, Emilec; spend no more The day in useless grief; but leave these hills, And take thy journey to the plains below: I'll be thy Guideâmy Son shall keep our flocks. I feel an impulse that assures my heart: An omen that we shall return with joy. Yes, we shall hear of Caia. Hear of her! Emilec cry'dâOh horrid! must it be? My nature shuddersâyet, I'll hear the worst. My Love, my tender Spouse, my late Delight, O may I hear thy death! that thou no more Mourn'st in a hated Russian's loath'd embrace. If Justice be in Heav'nâHere grief and rage Stopt further speech. They homeward shap'd their way, And for their journey to the plains prepar'd. Now rose the Morning; on their pilgrimage The anxious Swains go forth; each in his belt A leathern bottle, from the fountain fill'd, And in his hand the pilgrim staff each bore. Of Patience and deliverance from woe, Arandus talk'd, and of all-righteous Heav'nâ That Heav'n governs, my Son, thy eyes shall see, In all the ways of Men: On Industry Attends the handmaid Wealth; on Piety The angel Peace, her mates are Hope and Joy; Labour and Temperance and rosy Health Go smiling, hand in hand, and hoar old Age, With senses all entire, a rev'rend form, Attends their latest days. But Negligence And Prodigality, are, step by step, By Scorn and wither'd Penury pursued; Impiety, with terrors all-aghast, Receives th' unwelcome visit of Disease; Intemp'rance, with swoln eyes and putrid breath, Is follow'd by Diseases, a dire train, All gaping for their prey: Thus o'er the Wretch, Who, in the desart wild, expiring lies, The hov'ring Vultures swarm. Thus, as they went, Arandus talk'd; but dumb with sullen grief Emilec pass'd along. The lively Lark Springs from the grass before them, and his song Melodious chants; from ev'ry bloomy spray The sacred voice of Nature's music sounds; But these with not one gleam of joy inspire Emilec's breast; deep in the thicket coos The widow'd Turtle, and awakes the thoughts Of tender loves, and all th' endearments sweet Of the lost Caia: Now Emilec's heart With the sharp pangs of softest pity melts, Now sullen to obdurate grief returns. Now far, their native fields behind them lay. Three days o'er rocky hills and sands they go; The waste of Nature: Now the hoary steep They climb, and on the mountain's ridge behold The loaden'd clouds burst; thro' a valley now They hold their weary way, beneath the shade Of some bleak mountain, winding oft by turns, Now tow'rd the rising, now the setting sun; While, up the craggy brow, a timid flock Of Goats would run, and, from their airy height, Look down with wonder on the Swains below; Now, hov'ring o'er their heads, high in mid air The Raven and the Vulture scream'd aloud. Three nights, on the cold earth, in some wild cave Form'd by the rock, they lay: But when the sun Wak'd the fourth morning, their glad eyes beheld A champaign wide and broad; such as before Emilec never saw; 'twas pasture most, With many a herd of goodly beeves adorn'd; A pleasant river, from an aged wood, Ran murm'ring thro' the plain; the curling smoke Wav'd o'er the trees, and told a cot was near. Thither they shape their way: A Shepherd's house Stood at the entering of the wood, amid A grove of Elm, whose roots the river lav'd. They enter in, and share the rural treatâ And much the Host engag'd their wond'ring thoughts: A few grey hairs his rev'rend temples crown'd; One hand supports his head, the other smites His bosom, while th' unconscious sigh would rise; Languid dejection mark'd his eye, that, fix'd, Gaz'd on the wall; yet calm and mild he seem'd, Though 'whelm'd with grief. The venerable head So humbled and crush'd down by cruel Fate, Made ev'n Emilec for a while forego His own, and feel his woes. With kind intent, And sympathetic tears, Arandus asks The source of such sublimity of grief. Long happy, in these plains, the Host reply'd, I pass'd my days; oft ere the sun eclips'd The stars of morn, with light and chearful heart, I rose to labour; when the twilight warn'd To fold the flocks, still happy was my heart; Dear was my Spouse, and long, oh! long ago Our love had to the dearest friendship risen; Heav'n blest my Children, ev'ry day they gave Some new delight; to chear my age-dull'd heart Was all their strife, their care; so blest was I. But sorrow comes to allâA fever seiz'd, And scorch'd my veins; a wild delirious dream In horrid chains of darkness bound my Soul, Long twenty Suns; a thousand dreadful forms Glar'd all around meâsunk-ey'd, lean-rib'd Ghosts Yell'd in my earsânor Spouse, nor Son, I knew; Or, knowing, thought them leagu'd to work my woe: Till, as a Man who slow from sleep awakes, Awak'd my ReasonâFor my Wife I call'd; A Servant came; his looks, but not his voice, Told she was deadââWhere are my Sons?â I call'd: None gave me answerâAfter many a tear, I heard, some troops who from the hills had stole A lovely Fair, had also stole my Boys. Comely they were, O Youth, and much like theeâ Here stopt his speech; for down his hoary cheeks The woful torrent ran, while he survey'd Emilec's youth, so like his own lov'd boys. Now broke with grief and age, the Host resum'd, I bow the languid head: no tender Spouse, No loving Child, to bless my eyesâOh lost, Lost are my Children! and I mourning wait My dissolutionâYet, Oh, had it pleas'd The awful will of Heav'n, that I had gone Down to the grave in peace! Oh, that my Boys Had sooth'd my death-bed! but my tender Lambs Must groan in slav'ry!âOh, my Sons, I feel Your dreadful fate, and how you feel for me: But spare your tears for me, for soon I rest. Thus spake the Host. Arandus much essay'd, With kind intent, to soothe his mighty grief; But all in vain. To him whose Soul's at ease, All just and reasonable it appears, With calm Content, to bear the direst fate; And Grief an unavailing madness seems. But vain is human wisdomâblank and sad Down sinks the heartâthe very bowels feel The horrid load of grief; and Wisdom's voice Affects no more than Music would a rock. The rural meal now past, with pray'rs and tears, They take their leave. Ay, we indeed have heard, Emilec cry'd, of CaiaâSighs on sighs Stopt further speech. Along the green wood side They hold the beaten path; and much they talk'd Of Providence; till, with her sable clouds, Approach'd grey Eve. Now far the shelt'ring wood Behind them wav'd; the distant craggy hills Began to kiss the sky; home to his marsh The Heron bends; but house or hamlet none The Pilgrams saw; and onward still, along The barren heath, they stray; 'twas mossy all, Rugged and black; and on the moonless sky Increas'd the awful gloom; the fire of Night Shew'd, here and there, his unctuous twinkling lamp, Now waving a pale meteor, now a point; Perplex'd, they follow as the wild-fire leads, Hoping to gain some road, or Shepherd's cot; But none they find: Now mir'd in mossy bogs, Now east, now south, o'er hilloc, brake and dell, They wander on, till tir'd of useless toil, They sit them down. Such is the hope of Man, Emilec cry'd; the poor benighted wretch, After the wild-fire Hope, strays on thro' Life; If in one shape or part it disappears, It rises soon in othersâstill he thinks It leads to Happiness; and follows still, Tho' ever disappointed. Such is Man Thro' Life; as we to-night, thro' this wild waste, Have follow'd, and in vain, the twinkling fire: And wisest he, in Life, like us to-night, Who sits him down, and scorns all future Hope. He said. And now, borne on the western gale, They heard the low of cattle far remote; Chear'd at the sound, they rise; and hie them on, In search of shelter from the gathering storm. And soon afar a lordly dome they spied, Whose num'rous windows blaz'd with many a torch, Far thro' the veil of Night. On as they came, They heard the viol, and the jovial dance; And now, the well-tun'd voice of Music swell'd The lofty Chorus; now, by turns, the hoarse Rude roar of Bacchanalians stun'd their ears. Here, the glad Pilgrims ween'd to lodge, nor deem'd It other than the hymeneal rite. But fast the gates were barr'd; and, roaring dire, Two furious Mastiffs rush'd, at the first knock. Strait, at the well-known sound, a Russian came, And sternly bade them hence;âelse, with them, he Would sport the Dogs unchain'd. With trembling steps They wander to a hedge; and in its shade Stretch down their weary limbs: And now the aid They oft had giv'n, themselves, in greatest need, Despair to find. Arandus, the last curst, Gave to Emilec; and thus, mild, preferr'd His ev'ning prayer, O Thou, the poor Man's Friend, The Pilgrim's Guide, th' Avenger of the Oppress'd, Protect us here to-night:âblest in thy care We lay us down to rest, and fear no ill. He saidâAnd soon they heard a gentle voice Oft crying, Where?âArise, the Stranger cry'd: I, from my cottage, heard the surly dogs; I knew some helpless Stranger was abus'd; I came, and I have found you:âCome with me, And welcome share what my poor cot affords. He saidâand led them home: A firstling kid, Brown bread, and wholesome herbs, and from the rock The living spring, compos'd the rural treat. Arandus, whose th' unhospitable roof, And why such festival to-night, enquires. No marriage, natal day, or Son return'd, Mallan, the Host, reply'd, occasions this Enormous revel, and profuse expence: Thus, ev'ry night, in riot Zandor lives. Never the Pilgrim's blessing in his porch Was heard; nor is the Tyrant less severe To us, his HusbandmenâOft has his hand Smok'd with the blood of Innocence: our barns He cruel plunders for each small arrear; Nay, from the sacred plough, last sowing time, He cut my lab'ring Steers, and drove them home To smoke upon his board: hence, poor and thin, My very fields upbraid his cruelty. Yet, tho' oppress'dâyet, tho' in constant fear That Zandor seize my allâstill while I have, The needy Pilgrim here shall have a friend: My straw-thatch'd roof the blessing shall receive That turns away from Zandor's stately tow'rs. Thus Mallanâand, in various talk, the hour Sacred to Rest stole on. Now balmy sleep Invigorates their nerves; and with the morn Refresh'd and hale they rise. False lay the road, And perilous; the Host conducts them on: A little hill was near, whose flow'ry top Commanded a fair landskip all around; They pleas'd ascend, and, on its South, behold The tow'rs of Zandor:âold and grand, they stood Amid a garden, such as that which own'd Alcinous' care. Here skilful Art improv'd, Not banish'd Nature:âfragrant, red and white, The mellow apples nodded on the boughs; The purple clusters of the cheering vine Bask'd in the Sun; the fig and olive wept Their od'rous tears; the fair JudÃ¦an palm Flourish'd in ev'ry walk; a lengthen'd row Of stately oak and fir, whose lofty boughs Wav'd in the ev'ning clouds and morning mists, Skirted the Garden from the northern blast; A river, cut in many a trotting rill, Meanders thro' each grove; the blushing rose And creeping cowslip ev'ry bank adorn; The parted streams meet in a crystal lake; The princely dome, the wavy oaks and firs Tremble in its bosom: with the dawning light, The Turtle's voice is heard; at ev'ning grey, Perch'd on the topmost bough, the clear-tun'd Thrush Melodious chants: Fair are the fields around; The great-dugg'd Kine, down in the meadows, feed Beside his fish-pools; and the gen'rous Steeds, Thro' richest clover, neigh and bound along; The full-ear'd Harvest nods his yellow heads Far waving in the gale: All seem'd as God Delighted to increase and bless the Man. Now from the sounding gates, with shouts of joy, Rode Zandor and his Sons; the hounds, well pleas'd, Came pouring after. On the road they met A poor old Manâpale hunger mark'd his cheek; His knees sore shook with ageâsome wither'd sticks, Gather'd with toil, he bore, to make his fire 'Gainst Eve's chill hour. For stealing of his wood Zandor upbraids him:âAt the Tyrant's nod A pamper'd Lacquey throws them in a pit.â The tim'rous hare now starts, and loud the horns And hounds rebellow; thro' the poor thin fields Of Mallan's corn, the Tyrant drives along, With all his cumb'rous train, who look'd with joy On the wild havoc.âWhere the Guardian now Of injur'd Innocence? Emilec cry'd: Where the all-dreaded bolt of Vengeance now, To stretch yon Tyrant foaming on the dust? O blame not Providence, the Host return'd, Ev'n I, whom poverty and toil surround, Ev'n I more true more heart-felt bliss enjoy Than great and mighty Zandor ever knew. He saidâand, till the fervid hour of noon, Conducts them on. The gold-ting'd Jemma roll'd His mighty flood in view: Adown his banks The Pilgrims held the beaten path, that led To mighty Agra, the imperial seat Of Great Mogul; where many a swarthy tribe, With all their Rajas and their Nabobs, kneel To take his dread commands. Thro' wavy fields Of yellow corn, they pass; and thicker still The hamlets and the villages appear. Here the blithe Reapers strive; their rustic Lord Holds a large goblet, full of sparkling wine, To glad the Victors: there, the loaden'd cart Cracks o'er the stubble, while the gath'ring boys Shout as she goes: the gently rising hills Blue vineyards all adorn; the copious flood Rowl'd far as eye could trace, and spotted all With fishing boats, and little viny isles; And southward, on his banks, the lofty tow'rs Of royal Agra mingle in the skies; The thin dun smoky clouds wave slowly o'er The far extended spires. Anon they hear The bells of Agra toll, a solemn sound! And soon the trumpets martial peal, and shouts Gathering on shouts: the noisy clamours still Grew louder on their ears. Thus, when at first The northern blast bursts forth, the ruffled sea Begins hoarse murmursâthen he foams and groans, And now his huge mountainous surges lash The islands, and outroar the howling blast. A height was near; the wond'ring Swains ascend, And southward see the far-extended plain All delug'd o'er with men. Thus, from his hill, The Cimbrian Shepherd, when he pens his goats, Sees the tall forest mantling all the plain: So long, so bulky, stood the Denizens Of Agra, all along the dale; and still, From the wide gates, the thronging multitudes, Chariots and Steeds, Bowmen and Musquetteers, Pour'd out amain: Now, thund'ring o'er the ground, Surrounded by ten thousand Horsemen fierce, Who held the naked sword, high in a proud Triumphal chariot, lin'd with beamy gold, With silver harness grac'd, the Monarch came, Far blazing as a God: His better hand The awful sceptre grasp'd; his starry robe Brighten'd the face of day; with living fires His high tiara shone. When now the host Beheld their Monarch, King of Nations, come, Waving the turban in the air, they rais'd An universal shoutâall nature round Seem'd at the dreadful peal to start, and loud The hills resounded; on the distant plains, The lordly Bulls glar'd round with sparkling eye, And roar'd again; up the smooth river borne, The mighty shout the distant Shepherds heardâ They heard and trembled. Thund'ring o'er the plain The Monarch drove along; and, as he rode, Arang'd his nations. Here the foamy steeds And chariots pour along, till almost hid In a long cloud of dust, that like a ridge Of hills divides the plain; right opposite The foot advance, a line immense and deep, Far o'er the lawn extended: Tall and strong Each of the nearest end, but less than boys, Or Fairies by benighted Swains descried, Appear'd the troops that form'd the farthest point. Amaze and awe cold through the Pilgrims ran. A Swain was near, to whom Emilec thus: O Stranger, what important event calls This multitude immense forth from the gates Of yon great city? Who the Man that, high Exalted like a God, commands them all?â What art thou? said the Stranger; hast thou not Of Gehan and Machor, the brothers, heard, Sons of our late great Monarch? Gehan there, First-born, commands; much of the people lov'd, The throne he mounted; but the fierce Machor, Far in the barb'rous Provinces remote, Has rais'd a mighty host; a few days march From Agra lies his camp: To-day he sent An haughty messageâYield the throne to me, And yield my brother chain'd; else Agra burns, And all her cloudy tow'rs shall kiss the dust. But Gehan for the dreadful battle arms His willing people.âAnd his God will bless His righteous arms, Arandus made reply. Now low the western Sun was sunk, the mist Rose from the river; the unwieldy crowd Back to the city throngâthe peopled tide Turns, ebbing less and less, till clouds of dust Close up the lagging rear:âIn with them went The Pilgrims; long they wander'd in the streets, But none invites them in; till, from the field, An aged Man, his daily labour done, Approach'd, and thus: My house to-night is yours, And yours the ancient hospitable treat: Come, and in safety rest. They follow'd glad, And shar'd the welcome bread; and now the hour Sacred to balmy slumbers call'd to rest. But they, who other noise had never heard At the lone hour of night, than rustling gales Walking among the trees, and from afar The roar of Ganges; they, whom noise ne'er wak'd, But when the northern tempest howl'd among The mountains, wak'd, and fill'd them with grand thoughts Of Nature's Godânow pass'd th' uneasy night, Plagued with the Drunkard's song and Harlot's brawl, When, flown with insolence and wine, the Sons Of Riot stroll along. When now approach'd The hours of labour, from their restless couch The Pilgrims rise: The Host goes out along To shew the townâA garden lay in sight; There, while the rising Sun first gilds the boughs, A venerable Man, past middle age, Walk'd to and fro; his piercing eye was big With public care, and oft his lips would move. There, cry'd the Host, intent on public weal, The best of Magistrates!âThe hours of morn He thus employs. The word was scarcely gone, When writhing in the dust, the Ruler lay, Along broad arrow trembling in his side: A Wretch of cruel face, quick seiz'd his gold, And fled untouch'd. Vain was Arandus' help; Life trembled a few moments on the lips, And deep eternal Darkness veil'd his eyes. And now the num'rous streets began to throng; The market-place was near; there to a crowd Of Supplicants, a venerable Man, Of middle age, bestow'd the daily bread. Arandus smiling, thus the Guide address'd: Say, who is he, yon happy Man, whom Heav'n Has blest with wealth, and such a god-like heart? Rhadzan, the rich and good: reply'd the Guide. Not in mean luxury he spends his wealth; Like the great Fathers of Mankind, he lives, In grand simplicity. Industry smiles Where'er he comes; full twenty stately ships Convey his traffic; many an hundred hand His trade employs; he half the city cloaths, And serves with all the benefits of life; The Nobles court his friendship, and esteem His company; the poor Man's pray'r is his. Oh happy Man! Arandus cry'dâHow blest With such abundant wealth, and such a heart! Now, full in sight, the lofty palace rear'd His proud triumphal turrets to the sky: Into the hall they went; the Indian throne Dazl'd their eyes; four silver pillars bore The brilliant chair; the purple hangings round, With stars of diamond and sapphire glow'd; Broad spread the canopy of beaten gold, Far blazing to the Sun the living rays. Long while the Pilgrims gaz'dâthen, with a sigh, Arandus thus began: O thou great Man, Who only darest ascend that awful seat, Ev'n thou shalt die; and, in the sleep of Death, Thy meanest Slave shall lie as soft as thee. That seat of God and Pow'r communicates No real virtue: In the sight of God Thou art no more than he, he whom the oak, Or hedge, have ever shelter'd from the storm, But only as in Virtue thou excellest. Now, turning out, near to the gate, they spy'd Three tatter'd Wretches, the epitome Of Want and Misery. One, old and blind, Sat on a stone; one, to the Passengers, Held out his stumps; and one, with wooden leg, Crawl'd after, to receive the welcome mite. Sure, cry'd Arandus, these have been dire pests, Deep villains, whom all-righteous Providence Has suffer'd not to dieâbut live, to awe The multitude; a dreadful monument! And yet the blind Man sings, and seems serene. These Men were never pests, the Guide reply'd. When Rhamadan, the banish'd Raja, rais'd A mighty host, and shook yon awful throne, These Men at Belmoir field oppos'd their breasts Against his fiercest troops; and there their blood Flow'd plenteously: 'twas there they left their limbs. Hark! th' old blind Man, with youthful spirit, sings The Battle of Belmoir. A better fate, Arandus cry'd, you merit, than to beg Your bit of bread so near the awful throne Your blood and valour sav'dâAnd can, Oh Heav'n! Can the ingrateful Citizens pass by, And not once say, The blood of that pale face Was spilt for me,âthese limbs were lost for me.â He saidâand on they pass'd: Now, full in view, A tow'ry pile appear'd; the sculptur'd gates Lay open; with demure and down-cast look The Citizens throng in; in also went The Pilgrims and their Guide. There they beheld A People sour of look, with frantic nods, And cheerless mein, prefer their pray'rs to Heav'n; But meek Humility, and Charity, Her calm and smiling Sister, shew'd not there. Silent and sad, they leave the House of Pray'r; And Noon was highâHome with their Guide they turn; When, at the Market-place, a mighty crowd Came driving onâA Prisoner of note Was led to jail; behind, a beauteous Dame, Lovely in tears, as if an Angel wept, Stood looking on; a smiling Child she bore, Emblem of Innocence; two lovely Boys Clung to her fast, and oft, their little hearts Bursting with anguish, Oh my Father! cry'd. A sight so tender, from the Pilgrims drew The sympathizing tear: They keenly press Among the crowd, th' unhappy Man to see. Aghast the Pilgrims stand!âthe Guide exclaims, Rhadzan! the friend of Man!âThe cause they ask; A Citizen replies: When rose the Morn, Great was the wealth of Rhadzan;ânow, at Eve, He poor and friendless mourns.âBurnt are his ships, And Cadmor, whose unfeeling icy heart Ne'er warm'd with pity of another's woe, Now drags to jail the Father of the Poor: Their Father now no more.âIn deep amaze Arandus stoodâhis fluctuating thoughts Toss'd wildly round. Thus, when a Father hears A stripling boy is slainâwith biting grief, One moment he believes it is his son; Next moment chears himself; then fears again. Arandus thus, the dark mysterious ways Of Providence survey'd: As Death itself It chill'd his breast, to think that Man, tho' frail, Who fain would do aright, should be despis'd, And left forlorn by Heav'n: His piety O'ercame at last, Whatever is thy will, Eternal Father, is, and must be good.â He sigh'd within himself, then fears again. Now tumult spread from street to street; the town Was all uproarâthe shout of War was giv'n; The Horsemen drove along; and loud and shrill The trumpets call'd to battle; each his sword Girds on his thigh, and each prepares his spear; For fierce Machor was hard at hand; that night He ween'd the flames of Agra should have blaz'd Along the sky. The Pilgrims and their Guide With trembling pace haste home; when all on flame They spy'd his hospitable roofâhis goods The Miscreants prey: They lose him in the crowd. With fear and horror struck, they fly the town, And hie them thro' the plain. A lofty pile Of hoary rock appears, that high o'erhung The spacious field; they thither bend their way; And aided by the shrubs, from cave to cave They climb; till, in a hollow cliff, secure From sight or harm, they lye. The cloudy tow'rs Of Agra, and the mighty river, shew In distant prospect On a height, not far, The potent army of Machor encamp'd; And Agra, from her many gates, pours forth Her num'rous sons; wide sweeping o'er the fields The blazing of the arms, from camp to camp, Shoots dreadful lightning; nor when set the sun, And rose the moon, it ceas'd; a ghastly gleam Of helms and spears shines o'er the broad champaign; The neighing of the horses, distant far, And nearer some, the undulating noise Of thousands tongues and feet, along the rock Sounded in ev'ry gale. Thus from an height, A few miles from the coast, the Shepherd hears Old Ocean's midnight roar, when, after storm, He murmurs hoarse and loud. Anon arose The lively Morn: Each host in dread array Of battle ready stands; and ere the sun Blaz'd on their arms, the battle shout was heard, A dreadful peal! the trumpet's martial voice Shrill trembles thro' the air. In union firm The Infantry advance; the bows are drawn, And showers of arrows meet in middle air; The yell of Death begins; the Musquetteers Now, wheeling round, let loose their Stygian fire; Louder, and louder still, the brazen tubes Encrease their thunder; batt'ry roars amain, Thund'ring on batt'ryâall the plain appears As when an Earthquake bursts the trembling ground; And smoke and flame, in many a writhing curl, Sweeps o'er the frighten'd lawn. On ev'ry side The Warriors drop by hundreds; round and round The Leaders ride, and with their shouts provoke The staggering fight. Gehan from rank to rank Rides on conspicuous; loud his rousing voice, And great his warrior mein; the fire of Heav'n Flash'd in his eyes; where'er the battle rag'd, There first himself led on to fierce attack The fresher troopsâand Death march'd close along. Nor less the fierce Machor with great emprise Inspires his fainting host: His sword is seen Glancing thro' all the fight; at fullest speed He drives his courser on, from point to point Where'er his legions fail'd; black as the storm Of dark December, o'er the field he rode With whirlwind sound: the bravest stood aghast! And scarce resisting fell; while, terror-struck, Most fled his coming. Long the battle hung In doubtful scale; the Sun was high in Heav'n, The Shepherd sought the shade, when Gehan's troops Cry, Victory! The Heav'ns resound the cry. The horsemen and the foot now drive along, To crush the Rebels down. Despair inspires Machor's fierce heart; with fiercer fires it burns: A desp'rate band of Horsemen he selects, And with full speed, and many a dreadful shout, Turns on the Victors; thro' their ranks they rode O'er Lords and Vassals, groaning in the dust. Thus, when a cloud bursts on the mountain's brow, Rocks, trees, and herds, the headlong torrent sweeps Adown the hill afore it. Ghastly rout Now marks the host of Gehan; thund'ring thro' The fight the Monarch came; the cruel soul Of dread Machor glows at the wish'd-for sight; He cries, I see him! Silent now the warâ Aloof the Heroes stand. Fierce as a bear Attacks a tyger that devours her whelps; Or as a lion, from a mountain's side, Springs on a bull, the dreadless brothers meet. Their horses neigh; the earth gives hollow sound Below their feet; the Riders stretch and toil In mighty conflict, with the well-pois'd lance: The broken spears sing thro' the airâa pause, An awful pause ensuesâwith fiercest looks They eye each other. Dreadless thus, and fierce, A wounded lion on the Huntsman glares. Yield, cry'd Machorâyield thee, and live in chains; Or take thy death with honour from my hand. Justice and Heav'n, proud Slave, direct my sword, The Monarch stern reply'd; yield, ere I send Thy cruel Ghost to plunge in deepest Hell. Justice and Heav'n! with proud contempt, reply'd The fierce Machor; but Deaths fly round my steel. Black with dire rage, his long broad sword he draws, And on the Monarch flies: He, with like might, And equal valour fir'd, receives the foe. Long was the fight; their swords glance to the Sun, A hideous lightning, and the blood-red mail Rings with the blows. At last, the impious blade Of dire Machor, full down th' anointed head Of Gehan sunk: He, trembling, from his horse Fell. Swift the haughty Victor lights, and tears The royal ensigns from the mighty slain. For ever live the King, the great Machor! The fawning Nations cry. Amid their shouts, He mounts the royal chariot; and in proud Triumphals rides along the bloody field; Choak'd with the mangled trunks of Lords and Slaves, And horses slain, purpled with rosy gore, The riv'lets spread in lakes o'er the champaign, And, when the Sun shone ruddy from the west, Reflects red blaze for blaze; the ravens sat On the old land-mark stones, and drank the blood Of Chiefs and Rulers; and when pale the Moon Glimps'd o'er the field, the scene new horrors gain'd: The winds loud whistling rise, and to the hills Bear far the hollow groans;âNature seems mov'dâ And distant Echoes groan for groan return. All the dread night, troops of pale murm'ring Ghosts Glide thro' the moonshine, to their long abode. Silent, and much perplex'd, Arandus leaves The lofty cave, Emilec follows on. Their way along the winding hill they hold, Till, rifing from the clod, with mattins clear, The Lark salutes Aurora, and the East Glows with the coming day. There was a grove Of aged Elm, on mid declivity, That gave his shade, where oft the Shepherd pen'd His Ewes at eve; the Pilgrims, on the dust, There throw them prostrate down: at last, full vent Emilec gave his thoughts, and thus began: Too well, too sure, my boding Soul foresaw There was no Hope for me. When we began This journey, much you told me of a kind And righteous Providenceâfain would my Soul Have hop'd;âbut now, the dear delusion gone, A sad habitual bitterness of soul, And dullest anguish, must be ever mine. My Caia ravish'd!âjoy can never cheer My wounded heart again; and life is all A fev'rish woful dream. Alas! what woes Poor Man is heir to!âI am not alone, Tho' chief in mis'ry.âWhat a woful lot The poor old Shepherd must endure! himself Just wak'd from frightful madness, finds his Spouse, The Darling of his heart, laid in the dust; His Sons, his age's stay, by cruel men Led off to ev'ry horror Slav'ry yields! Fortune has grudg'd his former peaceful state; And now, his hoary head, sore bow'd with age, Must lower bow below the pressing load Of cureless Grief. Whatever Earth can give Zandor enjoys!âan earthly God he lives: Yet all his life is one continued act Of rapine and injustice! But, oh, mark The humble cot of Mallan:âwhat avail The Pilgrim's blessing, and the poor Man's pray'r, So oft bestow'd?âfor Poverty and Toil Have fix'd their dwelling there; and at the door Terror of Evil yet to come attends. A Ruler, great and good, we saw; intent On public weal, he pass'd the early Mornâ Where is the Guardian of the Good and Just? He falls! he dies!âthe Murd'rer 'scapes untouch'd! Rhadzan is great and wealthy, and his heart Flows with benevolence: At Morn, he lives The blessing of the peopleâsure, if Man Might claim the watchful care of Heav'n, 'twas heâ Yet, ere the Ev'ning Sun was down, he mourns, Comfortless, in a jail! What now avail The rich Man's friendship, and the poor Man's pray'r? No crumb he has, to give his fainting Wife, And little Children:âwhile, at ease, and full Of plenty, Cadmor lives; whose griping hand Ne'er gave one gen'rous deed! The three old Men, Who, for the Public, lost their blood and limbs, Scorn'd, and exposed to heat, to frost, to rain, Beg their poor bit of bread from those, whose wealth Their ill-spent valour sav'd. Long in the streets, Unknown, we wander'd; none invites us in, Till an old Man, of hospitable heart And virtuous soul, constrain'd us home, and joy'd To serve us Strangers.âMust a house be burnt? Oh Heav'n! and is it his? Now, he himself Has neither bed nor roof! The House of Pray'r We saw; but heart Devotion, and her mate, Meek Charity, appear'd not there; there reign'd Grim Superstition, that, with sourest look, Damns all around; tho' oft, his own ill heart Steams with the blackest crimes, and foulest thoughts. Are these the Fav'rites of Heav'n? are these The select care of God? Alas! my Soul, All, all is an inexplicable dream. But not alone are Individuals left To fall unnoted by a watchful Heav'n: Nations in one great ruin are involv'd; The Wicked prosper, and the Guiltless bleed: The lawful Monarch, much belov'd and good, Goes to the Fields of Death, t' assert his right; But the weak arm of Justice sinks below The impious Rebel's sword! the righteous cause Is lost! and he, who like a God rode forth, Now, gash'd with wounds, lies naked in the dust! And now, in place of a mild righteous King, A cruel Fratricide the sceptre wields! Good Heav'ns!âwhat mis'ry, what blood, what strife, Must fill this wretched land!âwoe to the Good, Woe to the Just; but to the Wicked, Peace! That Heav'n bore rule, you said, my eyes should see, In all the ways of Men:âthat have I not. On Industry, you said, the handmaid Wealth Attends: let Rhadzan and poor Mallan tell The dire reverse. On Piety, you said, Attended Peace, whose mates were Hope and Joy. 'Tis false.âImpiety was never mine; God I ador'd, and trusted in his care: To ease th' afflicted, and to wipe away The tears of mis'ry, was my dear employ. Did e'er I eat my bread, while, at my gate, The Orphan and the Needy call'd in vain? Did e'er the gain of rig'rous Justice add One grain's worth to my store? Say, did my hand Prophane the altars? Was the weak low voice Of Mis'ry heard, and not my bowels yearn, To years of infamy, and months of woe? Did e'er my deed the Maid or Wife betray? Noâno; ev'n in the face of all my woes, My Conscience dares to say, I never did. Yet, if some secret error Heav'n observes, Oh, that I knew th' involuntary fault! With tears of blood then would I wipe it off.â Such was my piety, yet where my peace? Oh, where my hope?âMy dearest Caia gone! And ravish'd!âOh, my heart!âWhy rig'rous Heav'n, Oh, why didst thou such tender feelings give?â Such angelic affection?âNot, indeed, To give sublimity of hope and joyâ Ay me, 'twas with a double load to feel My wretched stateâmy Caia's wretched state! My Caia! can my heart, so firmly knit By mighty Love to thine, e'er taste one joy? The pleasant Morn, and Ev'ning mild, have lost Their wonted charms; disgustful is the grove, For thou art absent; life and nature wear A gloomy aspect, for thou art not nigh. What tender scenes arise in this sad breast! How oft returning, smiling, from the fold, At oak or hilloc, have I met my Love! What raptures would ensue, where soul and soul By Love's mysterious instinct are made one! But, ah! that dreary night that ended all My joy! Oft to the oak, oft to the brook, I went to meet thee; grey the twilight pass'd, The moon arose, but thou, my Joy, my Love, Appear'st no more!âno more shall I protect And chear my Love!âA Russian's hated bed!â Away, the dreadful thought.âIf Heav'n is just, It cannot curse thee soâAy, low thou liest Among the peaceful Dead. The Sun, to me, Now shines with dismal aspect; hill and dale, Before so gay, now wear a ghastly gloom, A deep, deep melancholy.âHope is goneâ Heav'n cannot chear me.âVillainy and Might Are only happyâGoodness mourns, and dies. In such an abject state as this, my Soul Disdains to live: Soon in the silent grave My heart shall feel her cureless woes no more. Emilec thus his woful mind gave vent, Nor less Arandus' pious heart was mov'd. Despair cold thro' him ran; shudd'ring each nerve, On the hill side, he, bow'd together, sits; His hands are firmly grasp'd; his hoary head Trembles between his knees.âA sudden noise Comes rustling thro' the boughs: A Son of Heav'n, Of godlike mein, fair as the rising Moon On hills of snow, before them stands reveal'd; A fragrance fills the air, such as the gales Of blest Arabia; down his shoulders strait His downy plumage flow'd, of living white, Bright as the stars of morn; a purple vest, Hem'd with the gold of Heav'n, around his waist Flow'd, loosely ty'd; the human face divine, Heighten'd beyond idea, he assum'd; Mix'd with the majesty of Eastern Kings, The mildness of a Brother, he display'd, Who meets his Sister after absence long; A spear directs his steps, and added grace To him all grace. The Pilgrims calmly rise, And hail him blest:âfor God had from their hearts All fear remov'd. Then, beckoning with his left, Mild, as a feeling Brother, thus he spake. All hail! all peace! O ye Belov'd of Heav'n! Far from the Courts of God, I come, to ease Your troubled breasts. With dear paternal care, Th' Almighty Father all his works regards; And mercifully just are all his ways. He knows the heart, and well the weakness knows Of poor short-sighted Man. A Father knows The folly of his Child; and though his boy Act as a Child, if tractable and meek, The Sire forgives, and loves himâShall not then, The eternal Father both forgive and love The contrite heart of his weak offspring Man? O'ercome with sorrow, and with passion blind, The Providence of God you have arraign'd: But he, all-goodness, he, who knows your hearts, Beholds what anguish there, the thought has rais'd. But lay aside your passion, and attend To your own Reason; lift your heads, and view These vast stupendous heav'ns, where worlds o'er worlds Unnumber'd roll; and, if you can, deny The great all-perfect God. Say, shall the Lord, Who, thro' ten million links, o'er all the vast Of Nature, has a perfect order fix'd, Sure and eternalâshall he leave to Chance His higher world of Morals? Ask thyselfâ Reason says, No; and all Creation, No. How blind, how drunk with passion, then the Man Who dares the Providence of God arraign! Because he, poor blind Atom, cannot see The grand design!âbecause, to his confin'd And unimprov'd ideas, the dread ways Of the Infinite One a maze appear? Mark well this truth: Although the Wicked die Swiming in wealth, and all the world can give; And though, with sorrow pierced, the Just expireâ There is a time, beyond the darksome graveâ A time for Justice. With a thousand tongues This cries, you are immortal; else, the God That spread these heav'ns is cruel and unjustâ Cruel to the Good, and to the Bad unjust. But still, though to the other side the grave Great part is left, on this yet much is done. Love, blest Content, and calm internal Peace, The fruits of Heav'n that sip the dews of God, Already in the good Man's heart spring forth: While Hatred, and a dark desire to see Its Neighbour's mis'ries, in the wicked heart Takes lodging, and with ceaseless torment gnaws Its own curst bowels; and at Death's dread hour With double vigour bursts, and ever grows; Itself its tyrant, and consummate hell. Strange events you have seen; perplex'd, unjust, All chance, to you they seem'd: but just and good Are all the ways of Heav'n, these events shew. The aged Shepherd, who had led a life Of simple virtue and sincere content, Blest in his Mate and in his rising Boys, Fair shone his eve of life; when lo! a storm, Hideous and fierce, breaks in; his Reason sleeps; And mimic Fancy, on his frighten'd Soul, Lets loose the Dogs of Hell. Let human Pride Be levell'd in the dust: the Lord of Heav'n Can on the wisest or most stubborn heart Let loose itself; there needs no Demons more. In mercy to the world, to check the growth Of Pride and Self-dependance, Heav'n bestows Its useful lessons: vain, he shews, and weak Is human wisdom; in a moment all, All may be lost. Secure the Shepherd liv'd; His heart, once pious, from his God had stray'd; His Children fix'd each passion to the world; But now he feels no house of rest is here: Long his dependance on his God was cold, But now his smart has roused the latent flame. His Wife has only met th' unalter'd fate Of mortal birth, and Heav'n has call'd her home; His Sons are not as his paternal heart Torments itself to think. When sorrow comes, How artful is the Soul of Man to tear And rack itself, with phantoms fancy-bred! Now, as a Mariner, who all the night Rides in a boat alone, in wind and rain, Longs for the hav'n, where he shall meet his friends: So he, submiss, awaits the happy hour To land him on the coast, where never more The friends shall part, or age or sorrow come. Nor shall his hoary hairs down to the grave In sorrow droop;âhis heart shall leap for joy, And calmly shall he lay his limbs to rest. The wicked Zandor you esteem'd possest Of ev'ry happiness, an earthly God, While virtuous Mallen liv'd the slave of toil. Still blind, still wrong, the arrogance of Men Will measure happiness by pomp and gold. Though ev'ry luxury of the East and West On Zandor's table meet, tho' ev'ry wine Flows at his call, tho' livery'd Sycophants Run at his beck, yet to his sated taste All is in vain, habitual all, and lost: Though at each interval of loose delight, Smut wit, and song go round; his hackney'd Soul Insipid finds them all. Remorse and Shame, For deeds of Cruelty, maugre his heart, Knock at his breast sometimes; then, must his roofs Resound with music; then, the sparkling wine Must load the table, and the laugh and song Go jocund round: Meanwhile, with gentle steps A wild delirium comes; light is the heart, And all is gay, and all his ways are good: Then, wild confusion, and a total loss Of feeling, follows. On his bed he snores; And, as the fumes wear off, a fev'rish strife His painful slumbers witness; parch'd his throat, His stomach sick, his head in aching whirls; While shocking dreams, of murder'd Innocents Baring their bleeding wounds, with horrid starts, Awake him to the feeling of his pains. Perhaps the chace deceives the dull forenoon; And noon and night repeat the same mad round. Though sharp anxiety, and yearning care To raise his little fam'ly, oft may fill Poor Mallan's heart, when evil accidents Blast his industry, when the Tyrant robs His barns, and tramples down his standing corn: Yet, mark how pure than Zandor's is his joy! Sweet is his morning, sweet his ev'ning work; The music of the wood and purling brook, At pleasant intervals of rest, delight His ravish'd soul, and lift his thoughts to heav'n; His herbs, brown bread, and milk, and now and then, On days of festival, a firstling lamb, Yield higher relish, and a purer health, Than Zandor ever knew; when scorch'd with heat, And from his toil athirst, the lacteal store, The juicy berry, or the crystal spring, Restore his spirits, and his nature cheer, More than from all his wines e'er Zandor knew. Chagrin'd, amid his troops of cringing Slaves, The Tyrant lives; while Mallan, at his fire, Among his prattling Children, glows with joy To mark his rising care; delighted more With their quaint lisping, and their op'ning buds Of Reason, than the finest sounds can give. The cruel heart can never feel the glow Of heav'nly warmth, that sacred Love inspires; Foul are its flames, and as a brute's its joy, The object unendear'd, and oft despis'd. Such Zandor's Loves. Now with unhallow'd fires, Indelicate, his bosom knows no rest; Now foul disgust succeeds; the Harlot's smiles, He knows, are bought, and hates; then woos again, And pines with jealousy; now burns with rage; Now, fretful, loaths the Partners of his lust. But pure is Mallan's love, fair as the light Of heav'n, and spotless as the mountain snow. A nameless tenderness, and soul-sprung joy, Whene'er his fair One moves, or talks, or smiles, With holy impulse swell his lab'ring breast. As Lovers of fifteen, all innocence, No selfish views they know; another Fair He cannot love, so sacred and entire His passion glows; nor other Shepherd she. Unconscious of the least neglect, or sign Of waining Love, the canker Jealousy Keeps far aloof. Love has its mighty pains Of delicate distress, when the dear Fair Gives oft, by little signs, or seems to give No proof of heart-born passion: but, oh far Are these from Mallan's breast. What first began In Love's mysterious instinct, now is risen, With lasting strength, to more than Love itself; The amiable virtues of the heart Its sure foundation and endearing soul. But this is far from all. The horrid sum Of Zandor's wickedness is now compleat; And Mallan's suff'rings too are near an end. Last night, I saw the Angel of Revenge Descend from Heav'n; a copious scroll he bore, Where ev'ry wicked deed of Zandor liv'd. On his high tow'rs he lights: I staid to see The dread event. 'Twas now the gloomy hour Of midnight, when the houseless Widow oft, And hungry Orphan, have on Zandor's head Implor'd the curse of Heav'n; and now his roofs The yelling shrieks of murder loud resound: The Tyrant starts from sleep, and with a torch Explores his way; and, lo! his younger Son! Red with warm blood he stands! the fire of Hell Glares in his eye! the knife reeks in his hand! His Brother, torn with many a gushing wound, Struggles among his feet! Now must the wretch, Whose cruelty has rent, with sharpest pangs, The heart of many a Parent, many a Child, Feel for his murder'd Son: his locks he tears, Prone on the ground he roars; he curses Heav'n, And gives his heart to rage and deep despair. Caliona was crost in tender love, By her stern Father, wild her fancy ran, And lost her Reason; all the day she sits Grasping a marble Statue, which she takes For her dread Sire; the feet she bathes in tears, And begs him to consent: unmov'd and cold, The marble frowns: so, unconcern'd and cold, The Angel of Revenge beholds the flood Of sov'reign mis'ry, that overflows the house Of Zandor, all-accurst. A haggard train Of Evils to the dreadful Angel bow: Here, Torture writhes his skinless ribs and joints, Wild flash his eyes, and black and wide his mouth; There, Shapes of Terror tremble, such as haunt The dreams of Parricides: In dread despair, Here Horror wrings her hands; as, at the hour Of midnight, o'er the warm self-murder'd corse The Soul yet hovers: These, and many more, Thick as the Ghosts that mourn along the streams Of black Cocytus, all attend his nod. He gives the awful word, the Gout and Stone Obey, relentless; and, to a dire bed Of wretchedness, confine the country's Pest. No more thro' the poor Peasant's little field Of standing corn, he and his Sons shall ride; No more shall sack the barn, and rob the fold; No more, with rig'rous hand, oppress the Oppress'd; He and his Sons, betray the Maid no more. How dreadful is the wrath of Heav'n incens'd! Though slow, yet sure the bolt of vengeance comes: As sure the virtuous Suff'rer, who resigns With meek humility, and filial hope, Shall raise his head; and ev'ry woe, then gone, Shall add a heav'nly relish to his joys. So sacred are the pains of Innocence. The tender Vine must feel the Pruner's knife, The noblest Apple-tree must bear an wound; Else wild the Vine, the useless spreading boughs In rude disorder would itself destroy; The Apple-tree, instead of golden fruit, Would only bear a little wrinkl'd crab, Sour, and ill-flavour'd:âSuch, if left at will, In full prosperity, would Man become. Adversity is Virtue's fav'rite school; There, the pretended Vot'ries are dismist With vile dishonour, but her real Sons Bear up, and conquer all. The Siren song, The sparkling cup of Pleasure and Deceit, These happy Men shall shun: for base Deceit, A deadly snake, below the harlot lap Of Pleasure lurks. When lov'd Prosperity On the untutor'd Youth all chearful beams, From joy to joy his careless heart will rove; Heav'n is forgot, the Virtues dormant lie, Pity is troublesome, while Pride each day And Sensuality creep slowly in. From such to guard, Heav'n in Adversity Has long school'd Mallan's heart; and now he needs The bitter draught no more; and Heav'n no more Will give it:âchearful Plenty soon shall crown His table, and dispel each anxious care. How false the views that mortal eyes can take! Toil, Fear, and Poverty, to you appear'd Surrounding Mallan's hearthâyet, what a heav'n His moss-green roof o'ershades! with her fair train, The Angel of contented Peace is there: There, lively Hope presents her magic glass, That thro' the blackest cloud that darks the night Of dire Adversity, can spy a fair And pleasant country; Faith behind her stands, And tells the virtuous Soul, that all and more, As yet but darkly seen, shall be her own; And heav'n-born Charity, Daughter of God, Prepares his heart to taste the treasur'd joy. The tender Mother, when her only Son, A weakly child, at first essays to go, With pleasure and concern strong in her eye, Beholds him, and supports his waddling steps: So pleas'd and so concern'd, the Angel guards The steps of Mallan: With prophetic dreams Of wealth, his happy slumbers she inspires. His visions take him to the harvest-field, Amid his Reapers; all the ground appears So throng'd with sheaves, that scarce a path remains. He wakes, and hails the omen; balmy Sleep Again his eye-lids seals; again he stands Amid his Reapers, rank and strong the corn Before them waves; he looks behind, and, lo! Among the ricks, a sudden harvest rears Its golden heads, and plenty smiles all round. He wakes, and with devout up-lifted hands, The God of Providence his heart adores. There's not a Demon haunts the Human Race. Like Poverty, so dreaded, so abhor'd: His ghastly visage ev'ry horror wears, That Fear and sickly Fancy can create. So Men behold him; but, it is not so: If God but send the Angel of Content, He wears no terror; in the sable garb Of Wisdom, from the house of Mirth he turns, And, calmly, in the house of Mourning, weighs The Vanity of Life. The urban Youth A joyless melancholy wretch esteems The lonely Shepherd on the bleak hill side; The Man of Ease shrinks at the dreaded thought Of sweat and labour; he, who sees the sun, And human face divine, deems him accurst On whose blank eye-balls never shone the day; And you, as monuments of wretchedness, The three maim'd Warriors hold. Still wrong ye judg If Heav'n shall give Content, the Blind, the Lame, The lonely Shepherd, and the lab'ring Hind, Possess as much of bliss as life can take. As soundly, with his dole, the Palmer sleeps, As with his many fields the wealthy Lord; The Blind knows not his loss, or habit long Inures him not to feel; the Labourer Is used to labour, to his crutch the Lame. Content and good the three maim'd Soldiers live; But, should the horn of Affluence be pour'd Upon their boardâvoluptuous, insolent, Would their low minds become. To ev'ry state Patience and sweet Complacence Heav'n can give, Or send the biting canker Discontent. Shock'd to the Soul, you saw the woful fate Of Rhadzan, great and good; yet ev'n the fire That burnt his plenty, Heav'n in mercy sent. His alms, that first in charity began, In foolish ostentation now were giv'n; The lazy Drone, and him of real want, Shar'd all alike; and vain his heart became; The offspring of his wisdom and desert, He held his mighty wealth; but now he sees And mourns his folly. A rich fleet next day, Long since giv'n up for lost, all safe arrives: Rhadzan again is wealthy, and again The Father of the Poor; but now no more Th' Encourager of baneful Idleness, Vain and forgetful of his God no more. Th' unfeeling Cadmor, whom you thought so blest, Swiming in plenty, and, tho' ill of heart, Sharing the care of Heav'n, while Rhadzan mourn'd Abandon'd in a jail; Cadmor is curs'd, And long has been, with wealth he cannot use. Devoted to his gold, the meagre Wretch Grudges his own coarse morsel; never joy, Save th' anxious sordid one to view his gold, Could touch his marble heart; each blast of wind That murmurs in his key-hole, tears his Soul With dire chimeras; from his bed he starts, And feels his bolts and bars: oft as he trusts, When lur'd by profit, till he get again, He trembles for his gold. By night and day, Intense and restless, works his little mind, Still to increase the wealth he cannot use; And when a loss befalls, the pains of hell Seize on his breast. Such fruits his treasures yield. When manly Piety, old gen'rous Faith, The heav'n-descended fire of Patriot Zeal, And toilful Industry, forsake a land, Then base Effeminacy, and her mates, Pride, Cowardice, and Lust, a baneful crew! Triumphant lift the head; and in their rear, True as the shadow, Public Ruin comes; Weak at the first, but fast the Monster grows, And great her strength becomes; the God of all Girds her with pow'r to crush the abandon'd race. The Good and Wise, dread pillars of the state, Infatuated now, their deepest schemes Turn out but to increase the public woe. Just when a deep-plan'd enterprize is ripe For execution, all at once 'tis broke; The Planner dies: Such was the Ruler's fate, Whom murder'd at his morning walk you saw. Had he surviv'd, the fierce Machor to-day Had roar'd in chains. The wretch who gave the wound Was Son of his ungovern'd lust, the fruit Of lawless love: and who so fit as he? Full thirty years since, to the streets expos'd He left the Boy, where ev'ry vice he learn'd That Idleness begets on infant minds: Long has he been a public pest and curse, But now his race is o'er; the Ruler's gold He had not spent, when Justice claim'd his blood. Gehan to-day, had the Chief Ruler liv'd, Had still enjoy'd his crown, and blest the land: But it deserv'd him not; and Heav'n has sent A cruel Tyrant, with an iron rod, To crush the vicious and abandon'd race. When manly Piety, old gen'rous Faith, The heav'n-descended fire of Patriot Zeal, And toilful Industry, again shall raise Their honour'd head, Machor shall dearly pay His brother's blood; but not in gallant war, Where Death no terror to the brave Man bears: His golden roofs shall echo back his groans, His bed and pavement with his gore shall swim; While slow, beneath a Menial's knife, he dies. Another Gehan shall again restore Justice and Happiness, and bless the Land. Meek Piety and mild Benevolence Seem'd far from those that throng'd the House of Pray'r, And claim'd the care of Heav'n; while Selfishness, And hateful Melancholy, held their place. Are these the select care of Heav'n? you cried; And real Piety you deem'd a name. But be not self-deceiv'd: What, shall the shew Of patriot Zeal, that in base treason ends, Persuade you there was never such a man As real Patriot? Shall the varied lore Of Schools, as varied as the human face, Persuade you there is no such thing as Truth? And shall the gross mistakes of poor blind Man, Who knows not whence he came, nor where he goes, Your minds so darken, that you cannot feel What heav'nly warmth true Piety imparts? She, only She, the Soul's unbounded wish Can satisfy; an ever-gnawing worm Imbitters ev'ry joy the world can give; Each wish attain'd, a disappointment brings, And still, unsatisfy'd, the Soul will crave; For none but God himself can fill her wish: Man, that strange compound, feels a nameless want Toss in his breast; he feels it point to heav'n, And ask protection there;âbut how to gain That boon, the soul of life, he little knows. Wild have the errors, strange the mazes been That Man has wander'd thro': The Sun, the Moon, The Stars, the Fire, have all been hail'd as Gods. To Onion, Ox, and Dog, as emblems fit And habitations of th' eternal One, Sage Mizraim bow'd the knee: And Men, weak Men, Now dead, and all their weakness out of view, When Fable swell'd their deeds, the Nations hail'd As Gods and Guardians. If the storms descend, If Pestilence or raging War destroy; To expiate the wrath of angry Heav'n, The lab'ring Ox must leave the yoke, the Goat His craggy hill, the Lamb his mother's side, And at the altar die;âand, dire to tell, The Parents bring their young, their best lov'd Boys And fairest Daughters by the knife must bleed, And on the altar burn; with hideous shrieks The hills and skies resound, while with lewd rites, And incantations under many a name, The Pow'rs of Heav'n are call'd; yet all the while The Heart is quite forgot; ev'n in the act Of Worship, murders, fraud, and stern revenge, And violence, and lust, are nourish'd there. Others, on whom a purer light has shone; To whom the amiable God has said, âGive me thy Heart, my Son,â have oft forgot The sacred precept, or esteem'd it light. To count the leaves that tremble in the woods Of Mount Lebanus, were an easier task Than to narrate the ills that have aris'n From the fix'd Pride, Ambition, and Revenge, And Avarice, of those who have assum'd The name of Teachers, and the Sent of Heav'n. To serve their purposes, the earth must stink With human gore, the Kings must bend the knee, The nations must deliver up their wealth; All must be theirs; the keys of heav'n and hell Hang at their Headman's belt, who impious boasts He cannot errâyet oft old Atheist he. Amaze and horror strike me to relate How Men, low reptiles, dare, with base intent And solemn insult, mock the God of Heav'n, And stamp their horrid vices with his name. Others, of purer life and less design, Shock'd with the wickedness and black intent Of those around, a melancholy gloom O'ershades their souls: each wicked thought is held The black suggestion of the Evil One; Each warmth they feel is then a gale of Heav'n; Reason is laid aside; these follow'd close, Though jarring oft as lurking Passion leads. Thus, self-deceiv'd, in the worst light they view Poor erring Man; whatever is against Their own sufficient standard is abhor'd, Accurs'd of God, and merits not his love. Thus Charity is laid aside; her place A keen attachment to some trivial point Of system holds,âthough seldom it concerns The Goodness of the Heart. Thus Brothers oft, Fathers and Children, when they chance to jar, Each, sure he acts from dictates all-divine, Betrays a native honesty of heart Into most vile excesses: Not one jot Will either yield, and each to hell consigns His Opposite; the amiable God, To his poor melancholy soul, appears A stern relentless Tyrant, who denies The means of Knowledge, and, for knowing not, Condemns the Being of a Yesterday To fixt despair and everlasting fire. Though prone to Error, and the wild extremes Of Superstition, under many a form, The Nations all have been:âLet that, ye Wise, Bear its due weight, and shew the human Heart Still seeking some great good, which unpossess'd No rest it knows. If Man has wander'd thro' The wildest errors and most childish toys, In search of this high boon; let that awake Your Reason and strict Caution, to explore The crowning HappinessâSeek it, ye Wise, In th' Innocence and Goodness of the Heart, In filial hope and faith on parent Heav'n; Then, when the ills of life, or ghastly Death, In all their terrors come, your Soul shall stand The awful shock, and feel it has not grasp'd An empty shadow; while the selfish heart Of Superstition finds, in dire amaze, Its bulwarks shadows, and its hope the wind. All-just and big with mercy are the ways Of the eternal Sire. Thy doubts dispell'd, Thy doubts that gave thee so severe distress, Arandus, now be happy; never more Shall they approach thy breast. And thou, O Youth, Who lately underwent'st the last extremes Of mental torture, never let thy mind Forget the awful scene; let it direct Thy after conduct, and awake thy love And gratitude to Heav'n. Your City-guide, Whose hospitable roof the flames devour'd, Approaches near: While, from the battle lost, Agra was all confusion and uproar, The Monarch's Concubines unguarded fled, A lovely Fair, whose looks were innocence And virtue, weeping fled: No road she knew, For she was newly come: chaste as the Rose Unblossom'd, of the fanning Gale's embrace; Her charms protected her: the Emperor Her mighty beauty was alone to share; And that Rebellion and his death forbade. Her, now, your City-guide protects; but where To wander or to lodge, he nothing knows; Yet, trusting Heav'n, with pious faith, he leads Along these winding hills, in quest of food, Her and the aged Shepherd's Sons, whose tale Appear'd so big with woe. Home to your hills Take the old Man, and let his setting sun Decline in happy ease, and pious peace; And give the Shepherd back his dear-lov'd boys, And share and witness his excess of joy. Be happyâO Emilec, never more Let Doubt, or worse Despair, your breast invade. So spake the Angel; and, with smiling look, Ascended, as the flame of sacrifice Offer'd by Prophets old. In wonder lost, Amaz'd Emilec stood! when, looking round, The old Man and his Company he sawâ The lovely form of Caia struck his eyes! With hands half-lifted, motionless he stood. She too soon saw him; with a modest blush, That he might ought suspect, and trembling pace, Advances to her Love, her sole Delight. Thus, pure in innocence, our Mother Eve, In virgin modesty and conscious worth, Met Adam, first of Men. As one awak'd From a wild dream, Emilec sprung to life: My Caia!âTears no other words allow'd, While on her neck he hung: And she, in tears Of extasy and overbearing joy, Oh met again!âsafe as thy tenderest wish! Yesâit is he!âmute on his breast she fell: My Caia! Oh my dearer self! he cry'd, And have I got thee safe!âOh, Parent Heav'n, Forgive the errors that my bitter woes Extorted from me; and accept my praise And warmest gratitude, for this great gift, Bestow'd beyond belief. Eternal King, Arandus join'd, though dark thy ways may seem To poor short-sighted Man, the humble Soul That mourns his folly, and thy mercy trusts, Shall never lack thine aid. Almighty Lord, This crowns thy greatness, and compleats the God. All praise and glory, pow'r and might, be thine; Thy grace, thy favour, and thy love be ours. So spake Arandus; and the happy Youth, Erewhile confounded and depress'd with woe, Enraptur'd now, feels with redoubled joy, The glad return of Nature's lovely charms. The Sun with gladd'ning lustre shone, the hills Appear'd in lively green, the Shepherd's pipe Amid the bleatings of his flock was heard; The Lark, as emulous to aid their joy, Springs from the grass, and chants his carols sweet, Around them as they go; the gentle gale Whispers among the boughs, where ev'ry note Of tuneful bird proclaims the joys of Love. While, hand in hand, with many a tender glance Of love divine, Emilec and his Bride Beguile the way; Arandus and the rest, With joyful hearts, home to their mountains hie. THE END.</field>
