For A iust Master haue I labour'd long: To A iust Master haue I vow'd my best: By A iust Master should I take no wrong: With A iust Master would my life be blest. In A iust Master are all Vertues met: From A iust Master flowes aboundant grace: But, A iust Master is so hard to get, That A iust Master seems of Phœnix race: Yet, A iust Master haue foundin fine. Of A iust Master if you question This, Whom A iust Master I so iust define; My Lie e Iames Stvart A iust Master is. And A iust Master could my Work deserue, Such A iust Master Would I iustly serue. Voy Sire Saluste. CORONA DEDICATORIA. To England's, Scotland's, France &amp; Ireland's King: Great Emperour of EVROPE'S greatest Iles: Monarch of Hearts, and Arts, and every thing Beneath BOOTES, many thousand myles: Vpon whose Head, Honour and Fortune smiles: About whose brows, clusters of Crowns do spring: UUhose Faith, Him Cham- pion of the FAITH en-stiles: UUhose Wisdome's Fame o're all the World dooth ring: MNEMOSYNE &amp;Her faire Daughters bring The DAPPNEAN Crown, To Crowne Him (Laureat) VVhole and sole Soveraigne Of the THESPIAN Spring: Prince of PARNASSVS, &amp; Piërian State: And with their Crown, their kingdoms Arms they yield; Thrice three Penns Sun-like in a Cynthian field. Sign'd by Times-Selves, and their high Treasorer Bartas, the Great: Ingrosst by Sylvester. Our Svn did Set, and yet no Night ensew'd; Our WOE-full loss so IOY-full gaine did bring, In teares wee smile, amid our sighes wee Sing: So suddenly our dying LIGHT renew'd. As when the ARABIAN (only) Bird doth burne Her aged body in sweet FLAMES to death, Out of Her CINDERS A new Bird hath breath, NOVE MVSÆ, SYLVESTRESIn whom the BEAVTIES Of the FIRST returne; From Spicie Ashes of the sacred VRNE Of Our dead Phœnix (dear ELIZABETH) A new true PHOENIX lively flourisheth, Whom greater glories than the First adorns. So much (O King) thy sacred Worth presum-I-on. Iames, thou iust Heir of England's ioyfull Vnion. Iames, Thou iust Heir of England's ioyfull Vnion, VNITING now too This long sever'd ILE (Sever'd for Strangers, from it Selfe the while) Vnder one Scepter, in One Faith's Communion: That in our Loves may never bee dis-union, Throughout-all Kingdoms in thy Regall Stile, Make CHRIST thy Guide (In whom was neuer guile) CLIO.To RVLE thy Subiectes In his GOSPEL'S Vnion. So, on thy Seat thy Seed shall ever Florish To SION's Comfort and th'eternall Terror Of GOG and MAGOG, Athëisme and Error: So shall one TRVTH thy people train &amp; nourish In meek Obedience of Th'Almightie's Pleasure, And to give Cæsar what belongs to Cæsar. And (to give Cæsar what belongs to Cæsar) To sacred Thee (drad Soveraine) dearest Iames, While sad-glad England yeelds Her Diadems, To bee dispos'd at Thine Imperiall Pleasure: While Peers &amp; States expose their pomp &amp; treasure To entertain thee from thy Tweed to Thames VVith Royall Presentes, And rare-precious Gemmes; THALIA.At Mindes and Meanes Concurre in happy measure. Heer (gracious Lord) lowe prostrate I present you The richest Iewell my poore Fate affoords, (A Sacrifice, that long-long since I meant you) Your Minion Bartas, masked in My words: With Him, my Selfe, my Service, Wit and Art, With all the Sinnevves of a Loyall Heart. With all the Sinnewes of a Loyall Heart, Vnto Your Royall Handes I Humbly Sacre These weeks (the works of the worlds glorious Maker) Divinely warbled by LORD BARTAS Art (Though through my rudeness heer mis-tun'd in part). For, to whom meeter should This Muse betake her, Than to Your Highnesse, Whom (as chiefe partaker) MELPOMENE.All MUSES Crowne For Principall Desarte? To whom should sacred Art and learned Pietie In Highest Notes Of Heavenly Musick Sing The Royall Deedes of the redoubted Dëitie, But to a learned and religious KING? To whom but You should Holy Faith cómend-her, Great King of England, Christian Faith's Defender? Great King of England, Christian Faith's Defender; No Selfe-presuming of my Witt's perfection (In what is mine of this Divine Confection) Boldens mee thus to You the Same to tender: But with the Rest, the Best I have to render For loyall Witness of my glad affection, My MITE I offer To Your High Protection; CALLIOPE.Which MORE it needs, The more it selfe is slender. But, for mine AVTHOR, in his Sacred-fury, I know your Highnes knows him Prince of Singers, And His rare Workes worthy Your Royall fingers (Though heer His lustre too-too-much obscure-I). For His sake therefore, and Your Selfes Benignitie, Accept my ZEALE, and pardon mine Indignitie. Accept my ZEALE, and pardon mine Indignitie (Smoothing with smiles sterne Maiesties Severitie) Sith from this Errour of my bold temeritie, Great good may grow, through heav'ns &amp; your benignitie: For, farre more equall to your Bartas Dignitie, This may provoke (with more divine dexteritie) Some NOBLER Wit, To SING to our Posteritie TERPSICHORE.This NOBLEST Worke, After it Self's Condignitie: Or else the sweet Rayes of you, Royall Fauour May thine so warm on these wilde Fruits of mine, As much may mend their vertue, taste, and savour, And Rypen faire the Rest that are behinde: The rather, if som Clowde of Comfort drop Amid the Braunches of my blasted Hope. Amid the Braunches of my blasted Hope, Three Noble pearches had my Muse of late, Where (Turtle-like) groaning Sad tunes she sate: But (O!) curst ENVIE did vntimely lop The First: the Next, bruiz'd with his Fall, did drop: The Third remaines, growen a great arm of State. Most WORTHIE So, But so præ-occupate EVTERPE.With others MVSES, That OVRS hath no scope. Wherefore for succour in her wearie flight, Hardly pursu'd by that sharp Vulture, Want, Shee's fain my Liege (with your good leaue) to light Amid the Top-leaves of Your CEDAR-Plant: Where, if you daign Her Rest from Fortune's wrong, Shee shalll more sweetly Ende her solemne Song. Shee shall more sweetly End Her solemne Song (If Heaven grant Life, and You give leave to doo-it) By adding fitly All those Partes vnto it Which more precisely to Your Praise belong (Wherein expresly, with a Thankfull tongue, To your great Self, Apollo's self applies-him, Yeelds YOU His Laurels, And dooth all agnize—him ERATO.Rapt vvith the VVonder Of Your Uertues, Young). All the Posthumiall race of that rare Spirit (His Swan tunes, sweetest neer his latest breath) Which, of his glory their Childes-part inherit (Though born, alas!) after their Father's death) As Epilogue, shall Pay our gratefull Vowes Vnder the shaddowe of Your Sacred Boughes. Vnder the shaddowe of Your Sacred Boughes, Great, Royall Cedar of Mount Libanon (Greater than that great Tree of Babylon) No marvaile if our TVRTLE seek to House; Sith Caesar's Eagles, that so strongly Rouze: Th'old Haggard Falcon, hatcht by Pamotlon: Th' Iberian Griphin (And not THESE alone, POLYMNIA.But every Bird and Beast) With HUMBLE vowes, Seeks roost or rest vnder your mighty Bowers: So mighty hath th'Almighty made you now: O Honour Him who thus hath Honour'd You, And build His house who thus hath blessed Yours. So, Stvarts ay shall stand (propt with His Power) To Foes a Terrour, and to Friendes a Tower. To Foes a Terrour, and to Friendes a Tower: Error's Defyer, and True Faith's Defence: A Sword to Wrong, a Shield to Innocence: Cheering the mild, checking the wilde with power: The Starre of other Stares, and Sterne of Our: The Rod of Vice, &amp; Vertve's Recompence: Long Live King IAMES in all MAGNIFICENCE: VRANIA.And (full of DAYES) When (in his Bliss-full Bowr) Heavens King shal crown thee with th'immortal flowr, Fall all These Blessings on that forward Prince Henrie (our Hope) to crown His Excellence A King at Home, abroad a Conqveror; So Happily, that wee may still Conclude, Our Sunne did Sette and yet no Night ensew'd. YOVR MAIESTIES Most loyall Subiect &amp; Humble Servant IOSVAH SYLVESTER. [These laureat Temples which the Laurel grace] These laureat Temples which the Laurel grace; These Honest Lines these Signes of Wit and Art; This Map of Vertues, in a Muse full Face; Are but a blush of Bartas outward part. The Pencil could no more: But his oxne Pen Limns him, with-in, the Miracle of Men. HIS LIFE, &amp;c. Sacrum Memoriæ Ornatissimi Pientissimique ipsius Amici, Magistri losuæ Sylvester; Qui in Oppido Middleburgensi, vicesimo octauo die Septembris, Anno Domini 1618. Anno? Ætatis suæ 55. Fatis Concessit. In Verse to personate what Art hath painted, Craves not Apelles, but Apollo's skill; The vaine and strain of Maro's learned Quill, Or some with sweet Vrania best-acquainted. Yet, sith even all, whose Browes are deckt with Bayes, Seem to neglect Thee; Pan hath ta'ne the paines (With Oaten-pipe, in homely rustick Strains) To sound, not Arts, but Hearts plain warbled Layes. Is't not a Wonder, worthy admiration, In this so Sin-full, Sin-soule Age, to see All reall Vertues in one Man to bee? All, met in one, to have cohabitation? Thou wast no Lordly great Cosmopolite; Yet, much renowned by thy vertuous Fame: A Saint on Earth (No need of greater Name.) A true Nathanael, Christian-Israelite. Thy Wisedom, in thy Sparing-Speech was showne. 'Tis strange his Words should drop, whose Works did stream: Yet, Words and Works shone (all) with Graces Beam: Thy Pietie, Sobrietie, well knowne. Religious, Valiant, like good Iosuæ. Religious, in Thy Selfe and Familie: Courageous, to withstand Adversitie And worldly Cares; which most men, most dismay. No Temporizer; yet, the Court frequenting: Scorning to sooth, or smooth this Ages crimes: At Warre with Vice, in all thy holy Rymes: Thine Israels-Sins (with Ieremie lamenting. No Crœsus-rich, nor yet an Irus-poore: The Golden-Mean, was thy Chiefe Loves delight. Thy Portion pleas'd thee well; and well it might: Than Pietie, what Riches better? more? His Languages.Adorned with the Gift of Gods good Spirit: I mean the Gift of Tongues; French, Spanish, Dutch, Italian, Latin. As thy Selfe, few such: But, for thy Native-English, of most Merit. Wherein, like former fluent Cicero (With Figures, Tropes; Words, Phrases, sweetly rare) Of Eloquence thou mad'st so little spare, That Nile (in Thee) may seem to over-flowe. His Works.Witness Du Bartas (that rare Master-Peece Of Poetrie) to past and future Times: By whose mellifluous, sugred, sacred Rimes, Thou gotst more fame, than Iason by his Fleece. Of which thy Work (I iustly may averre) The radiant Sun-shine is so fair, so trim, As other Poets Moon-light much doth dim; Admired Silver-Tongued Sylvester. Yea, All thy full-ear'd Harvest-Swathes are such, As (almost) all thy Brethrens high-topt Sheaves Bend, bow to thine, like Autumn-scattered Leaves; So white thy Wheate is, and the Weight so much. Nor wrong I them, by this harsh appellation. Their pleasing Veine was oft too vaine: but, Thine, Still pleasant-grave: Heer, Moral; There, Divine. Right Poet-Laureat Thou wert of our Nation. This then, say I (maugre the Spleen infernall Of Elvish-Envie) shall promote thy Praise, And trim thy Temples with nere-fading Bayes. Such heavenly Off-springs needs must live Eternall. What should I say? much more than I can say. A Man thou wert; and yet, than man much more. Thy Soule resembled-right an House of Store; Wherein all Vertues, in Thee, treasur'd lay. A blessed Death an holy Life ensues. Thy pious End this Truth hath well exprest: Such as thy Life, such was thy Death; all-blest: Thy Heav'n-born Soule, her Native-Home did chuse. And, hadst thou dy'd at Home, it had bin better; It would (at least) have given thee much Content: But, heerin, England's worthy to be shent, Which to thy Worth did prove so bad a Debter. Nor minde I this, but then I blush for shame To think, that though a Cradle, Thee it gave, Yet (O vnkinde) deny'd thy Corps a Grave; Much more a Statue, reared to thy Name. But, Thou wert wise; who to thy Selfe built'st One (Such, such an One) as is of endless Date: A reall, royall-one; which (spite of Hate) To Times last time shall make thy Glory knowne.

Heer lyes (Death's too-rich Prize) the Corps enterr'd Of Iosvah Sylvester Du Bartas Peer; A Man of Arts best Parts, to God, Man, deer; In formost Rank of Poets best, preferr'd. Iohn Vicars. Lectoribus England's Apelles (rather Ovr Apollo) WORLD'S wonder SYDNEY, that rare more-th?-man, This Lovely Venvs first to LIMNE beganne, With such a PENCILL as no PENNE dares follow: How th? shold I, in wit &amp; art to shalow, Att?pt the Task which yet none other can? Far be the thought, that mine vnlearned hand His heavenly Labor should so much vnhallow: Yet, lest (that Holy-RELIQVE being shrin'd In som High-Place, close lockt from c?mon light) My Countrey-men should bee debarr'd the sight Of these DVINE pure Beauties of the Minde; Not daring meddle with APELLES TABLE, This haue I muddled, as my MVSE was able.

EPIGRAM. To M. Iosuah Sylvester. If to admire were to commend, my Praise Might then both thee, thy work and merit raise: But, as it is (the Childe of Ignorance, And vtter stranger to all ayre of France) How can I speak of thy great paines, but erre? Since they can only iudge, that can confer. Behold! the reverend Shade of Bartas stands Before my thought, and (in thy right) commands That to the world I publish, for him, This; Bartas doth wish thy English now were His. So well in that are his inventions wrought, As His will now be the Translation thought, Thine the Originall; and France shall boast, No more, those mayden glories she hath lost. B. Iohnson. In praise of the Translator. If divine Bartas (from whose blessed Braines Such Works of grace, or gracefull works did stream) Were so admir'd for Witt's celestiall Strain's As made their Vertues Seat, the high'st Extream; Then, Iosvah, the Sun of thy bright praise Shall fixed stand in Arts faire Firmament Till Dissolution date Times Nights, and Dayes, Sith right thy Lines are made to Bartas Bent, VVhose Compass circumscribes (in spacious VVords) The Vniversall in particulars; And thine the same, in other I earms, affords; So, both your Tearms agree in friendly VVars: If Thine be only His, and His be Thine, They are (like God) eternall, sith Divine. Iohn Davies of Hereford. To M. Iosvah Sylvester, of his Bartas Metaphrased. I dare confess; of Muses, more than nine, Nor list, nor can I envy none but thine. Shee, drencht alone in Sion's sacred Spring, Her Makers praise hath sweetly chose to sing, And reacheth neerest th'Angels notes aboue; Nor lists to sing or Tales, or Warres or Loue. One while I finde her, in her nimble flight, Cutting the brazen spheares of heav'n bright: Thence, straight she gudes before I be aware, Through the three regions of the liquid ayre: Thence, rushing down, through Nature's Closet-dore, Sixe ransacks all her Grandame's secret store; And diving to the darkness of the Deep, Sees there what wealth the waues in prison keep: And what she sees above, belowe, between, Shee showes and sings to others eares and eyne. T'is true thy Muse another's steps doth press: The more's her paine, nor is her praise the less. Freedom gives scope, vnto the roving thought; Which, by restraint, is curb'd. Who wonders ought, That feet, vnfettred, walken farre, or fast? Which pent with chains, mote want their wonted haste. Thou follow'st Bartasses diviner streine; And singst his numbers in his native veine. Bartas was som French Angell, girt with Bayes: And thou a Bartas art in English Layes. Whether is more? Me seems (the sooth to say'n) One Bartas speakes in Tongues, in Nations, twayn. Ios. Hall. To my good friend, M. Sylvester, in honour of this sacred Work. Thus to adventure forth, and re-convay The best of treasures from a forrain Coast, And take that wealth wherein they gloried most, And make it ours by such a gallant pray, And that without iniustice, doth bewray The glory of the Work, that we may boast Much to haue wonn, and others nothing lost By taking such a famous prize away. As thou industrious Sylvester hast wrought, And heer enricht vs with th'immortall store Of others sacred lines; which from them brought, Coms by thy taking greater than before: So hast thou lighted from a flame devout, As great a flame, that never shall goe out. Samuel Daniel. To M. Iosvah Sylvester. A SONNET. The glorious Salust, morall, true-divine, Who (all inspired wish a Holy rage) Makes Heav'n his subiect and the Earth his stage, The Arts his Actors, and the Triple-Trine: Who his rich language gilds, and graceth fine: His Countries honour, wonder of our age; Whose Worlds blest Birth, and blessed Pupillage, Gain him a world of fame for every line; Hath heer obtain'd a true Interpreter, Whom, fame, nor gaine, but loue to Heav'n and vs, Mov'd to vn-French his learned labours thus. Thus loves, thus lives all-loved Sylvester. Forward, sweet friend: Heav'n, Nature, Arts, and Men, All to this task prefer thine onely Pen. G. Gay-Wood. Flexanimo Salustij du Bartus interpreti, Ios. Sylvesteri, carmen Encomiasticon. Oft haue I seen sweet fancie-pleasing faces Consort themselves with swart mishapen features, To grace the more their soule-subduing graces, By the defect of such deformed creatures; As Painters garnish with their shadowes sable The brighter colours in a curious Table: So, English Bartas, though thy beauties, heer Excell so farre the glory of the rest, That France and England both must hold thee deer; Sith both their glories thou hast heer exprest (Shewing the French tongues plenty to be such. And yet that ours can vtter full as much) Let not thy fairest Heav'n-aspiring Muse Disdaine these humble notes of my affection: My faulty lines let faithfull love excuse, Sith my defects shall adde to thy perfection: For, these rude rimes, thus ragged, base, and poore, Shall (by their want) exalt thy worth the more. E. G. In Commendation of du Bartas, and his Translator, M. Iosvah Sylvester. A Sonnet. While nights black wings the dayes bright beauties hide, And while faire Phœbus dives in western deep; Men (gazing on the heav'nly stages steep) Commend the Moon, and many Stars beside: But, when Aurora's windowes open wide, That Sol's clear rayes those sable clouds may banish, Then suddenly those petty lights do vanish, Vailing the glories of their glistring pride: So, while du Bartas and our Sylvester (The glorious lights of England and of France) Haue hid their beames, each glowe-worm durst prefer His feeble glimpse of glimmering radiance: But, now these Suns begin to gild the day, Those twinkling sparks are soon disperst away. R. H. In Commendation of this worthie Worke. Foole that I was, I thought in younger times, That all the Muses had their graces sowen In Chaucers, Spencers, and sweet Daniels Rimes (So, good seems best, where better is vnknowen). While thus I dream'd, my busie phantasie Bad me awake, open mine eyes, and see How Salvst's English Sun (our Sylvester) Makes Moon and Stars to vail: and how the Sheaves Of all his Brethren, bowing doe prefer His Fruits before their Winter-shaken Leaves: So much for Matter, and for Manner to, Hath He out-gon those that the rest out-goe. Let Gryll be Gryll: let Envie's vip'rous seed Gnaw forth the brest which bred and fed the same; Rest safe (Sound truth from fear is ever freed.) Malice may bark, but shall not bite thy Name: Iosva, thy Name with Bartas name shall live. For, double life you each to other give. But, Mother Envie, if this Arras spunne Of Golden threeds be seen of English eyes, Why then (alas!) our Cob-webs are vndon: But Shee, more subtle, than religious-wise, Hatefull, and hated, proud, and ignorant, Pale, swoln as Toad (though customed to vaunt) Now holds her Peace: but (O!) what Peace hath She With Vertue? None: Therefore defie her frown. Gainst greater force growes greater victory. As Camomile, the more you tread it down, The more it springs; Vertue, despightfully Vsed, doth vse the more to fructifie: And so doo Thou, vntill thy Mausole rare Doo fill this World with wonderment; and, that In Venus Form no clumsie fist may dare To meddle with thy Pencill and thy Plat. I feare thy life more, till thy goale be run, Than Wife her Spouse, or Father fears his Son. R. R. Malum patienti lucrum. An Acrostick Sonnet, to his friend M. Iosva Sylvester. If profit, mixt with pleasure, merit Praise, Or Works divine be 'fore profane preferr'd: Shall not this heavenly Work the Workers raise, Vnto the Clouds on Columnes selfly-rear'd? And (though his Earth be lowe in Earth interr'd) Shall not du Bartas (Poets pride and glorie) In after Ages be with wonder heard, Lively recording th'Vniversal Story? Vndoubtedly He shall: and so shalt Thou, Eare charming Eccho of his sacred Voyce: Sweet Sylvester, how happy was thy choise, To Task thee thus, and thus to quite thee now? End as thou hast begun; and then by right Rare Muses Non-Svch, shall thy Work be hight. R. N. Gen. To the Same. Had golden Homer, and great Maro kept In envious silence their admired measures, A thousand Worthies worthy deeds had slept. They, rest of praise, and wee of learned pleasures. But (O!) what rich incomparable treasures Had the world wanted, had this modern glory, Divine du Bartas, hid his heauenly ceasures, Singing the mighty World's immortall story? O then how deeply is our Ile beholding To Chapman, and to Phaer! but, yet much more To thee (dear Sylvester) for thus vnfolding These holy wonders, hid from vs before. Those works profound, are yet profane; but thine, Graue, learned, deep, delightfull, and diuine. R. N. Du BARTAS His FIRST WEEK, OR BIRTH OF THE WORLD: Where-in In Seven Dayes the glorious Worke of the Creation is divinely handled. In the 1 Day, The Chaos. In the 2 Day, The Elements. In the 3 Day, The Sea and Earth. In the 4 Day, The Heavens, Svn, Moon, &amp;c. In the 5 Day, The Fishes and Fovles. In the 6 Day, The Beasts and Man. In the 7 Day, The Sabbath. THE FIRST DAY OF THE FIRST WEEK. The Argvment. GOD's Aide implor'd: the Summe of all propos'd: World not eternall, nor by Chance compos'd: But of meer Nothing God it essence gaue: It had Beginning: and an End shall haue: Curst Atheists quipt: the Heathen Clarkes control'd: Doom's glorious Day: Star-Doctors blam'd for bold: The Matter form'd: Creation of the Light: Alternate changes of the Day, and Night: The birth of Angels; some for Pride deiected: The rest persist in Grace, and guard th'Elected. Thou glorious Guide of Heav'ns star-glistering motion, The Poet imploreth the gracious assistance of the true God of Heauen, Earth, Air and Sea, that he may happily finish the worke he takes in hand. Thou, thou (true Neptune) Tamer of the Ocean, Thou Earth's drad Shaker (at whose only Word, Th'Eölian Scouts are quickly still'd and stirr'd) Lift vp my soule, my drousie spirits refine, With learned Art enrich This Worke of mine: O Father, grant I sweetly warble forth Vnto our seed the World's renowned Birth: Grant (gracious God) that I record in Verse The rarest Beauties of this Vniverse; And grant, therein Thy Power I may discern: That, teaching others, I my selfe may learn. And also grant (great Architect of wonders, The Translater, knowing &amp; acknowledging his own insufficiency for so excellent a labour, craueth also the aide of the All-sufficient God. Whose mighty Voyce speakes in the midst of Thunders, Causing the Rocks to rock, and Hils to teare; Calling the things that Are not, as they were; Confounding Mighty things by meanes of Weak; Teaching dum Infants thy drad Praise to speak; Inspiring Wisdom into those that want, And giuing Knowledge to the Ignorant) Grant mee, good Lord (as thou hast giv'n me hart To vndertake so excellent a Part) Grant me such Iudgement Grace, and Eloquence, So correspondent to that Excellence, That in some measure, I may seeme t'inherit (Elisha-like) my deare Elias spirit. The world was not from euerlasting. Clear Fire for euer hath not Aire imbrac't, Nor Aire for-ay inuiron'd Waters vast, Nor Waters alwaies wrapt the Earth therein; But all this All did once (of nought) begin. Once All was made; not by the hand of Fortune (As fond Democritus did yerst importune) With iarring Concords making Motes to meet, Inuisible, immortall, infinite. Neither made by chance; But created together with Time by the almighty wisdome of God.Th'immutable diuine Decree, which shall Cause the Worlds End, caus'd his Originall: Neither in Time, nor yet before the same, But in the instant when Time first became. I meane a Time confused: for, the course Of yeares, of months, of weeks, of daies, of howrs, Of Ages, Times, and Seasons, is confin'd By th'ordred Dance vnto the Stars assign'd. God was before the World was.Before all Time, all Matter, Form, and Place, God all in all, and all in God it was: Immutable, immortall, infinite, Incomprehensible, all spirit, all light, All Maiesty, all-self-Omnipotent, Inuisible, impassiue, excellent, Pure, wise, iust, good, God raign'd alone (at rest) Himselfe alone, selfs Palace, host, and guest. He confuteth the Atheists, questioning what God did before he created the World.Thou scoffing Atheist, that enquirest, what Th'Almightie did before he framed that? What weighty Work his minde was busied on Eternally before this world begun (Sith so deep Wisedom and Omnipotence, Nought worse beseems, then sloth and negligence)? Knowe (bold blasphemer) that, before, he built A Hell to punish the presumptuous Guilt Of those vngodly, whose proud sense dares cite And censure too his Wisedom infinite. Can Carpenters, Weauers, and Potters passe And liue without their seuerall works a space? And could not then th'Almightie All-Creator, Th'all-prudent, BEE, without this frail Theater? Shall valiant Scipio Thus himself esteem, Neuer lesse sole then when he sole doth seem? And could not God (O Heav'ns! what frantick folly!) Subsist alone, but sink in Melancholy? Shall the Pryenian Princely Sage auerr, That all his goods he doth about him bear: And should the Lord, whose Wealth exceeds all measure, Should he be poore without this Worldly treasure? God neuer seeks, out of himself, for ought; He begs of none, he buyes or borrowes nought; But aye, from th'Ocean of his liberall bounty, He poureth out a thousand Seas of Plenty. Yer Eurus blew, yer Moon did Wex or Wane, What God did before he created the World. Yer Sea had fish, yer Earth had grass or grain, God was not void of sacred exercise; He did admire his Glorie's Mysteries: His power, his Iustice, and his Prouidence, His bountious Grace, and great Beneficence Were th'holy obiect of his heauenly thought; Vpon the which, eternally it wrought. It may be also that he meditated The Worlds Idea, yer it was Created: Alone he-liv'd not; for his Son and Spirit Were with him ay, Equall in might and merit. Of 3. Persons in one only Essence of God: of the eternall generation of the Son. For, sans beginning, seed, and Mother tender, This great Worlds Father he did first ingender (Towit) His Son, Wisedom, and Word eternall, Equall in Essence to th'All-One Paternall. Of the Holy-Ghost proceeding from the Father and the Sonne: The which three Persons are one only and the same God. Out of these Two, their common Power proceeded, Their Spirit, their Loue; in Essence vndiuided: Onely distinct in Persons, whose Diuinitie, All Three in One, makes One eternall Trinitie. Soft, soft, my Muse, launch not into the Deep, Sound not this Sea: see that aloof thou keep From this Charybdis and Capharean Rock, Where many a ship haue suffered wofull wrack, While they haue fondly vent'red forth too-far, Following frail Reason for their only Star. VVho on this Gulf would safely venture fain, How to think &amp; speak of God. Must not too-boldly hale into the Main, But 'longst the shoar with sailes of Faith must coast; Their Star the Bible; Steer-man th'Holy-Ghost. How many fine wits haue the World abus'd, The Heathen Philosophers lost themselues and others in their curiosities: and meaning to be wise, became fooles. Because this Ghost they for their Guide refus'd; And, scorning of the loyall virgins Thred, Haue them and others in this Maze mis-led? In sacred sheets of either Testament 'Tis hard to finde a higher Argument, More deep to sound, more busie to discuss, More vse-full, knowne; vnknowne, more dangerous. So bright a Sun dazels my tender sight: So deep discourse my sense confoundeth quite: My Reason's edge is dull'd in this Dispute, And in my mouth my fainting words be mute. God, the Father, Sonne, &amp; Holy-Ghost created of Nothing the Worlds goodly frame.This Trinitie (which rather I adore In humbleness, then busily explore) In th'infinit of Nothing, builded all This artificiall, great, rich, glorious Ball; Wherein appears in grav'n on euery part The Builders beauty, greatness, wealth, and Art; Art, beauty, wealth, and greatness, that confounds The hellish barking of blaspheming Hounds. Learning curious speculations, the Poet teacheth how to contemplate God in his Works.Climb they that list the battlements of Heav'n: And with the Whirl-wind of Ambition driv'n, Beyond the World's wals let those Eagles flie, And gaze vpon the Sun of Maiestie: Let other-some (whose fainting spirits do droop) Downe to the ground their meditations stoop, And so contemplate on these Workmanships, That th'Authors praise they in Themselues eclipse. My heedfull Muse, trained in true Religion, Diuinely-humane keeps the middle Region: Lest, if she should too-high a pitch presume, Heav'ns glowing flame should melt her waxen plume; Or, if too-lowe (neer Earth or Sea) she flag, Loaden with Mists her moistned wings should lag. It glads me much, to view this Frame; wherein (As in a Glasse) God's glorious face is seen: I loue to look on God; but, in this Robe Of his great Works, this vniuersall Globe. For, if the Suns bright beams do bleare the sight Of such as fixtly gaze against his light; Who can behold aboue th'Empyriall Skies, The lightning splendor of God's glorious eyes? O, who (alas) can finde the Lord, without His Works, which beare his Image round about? God makes himselfe (as it were) visible in his Works.God, of himselfe incapable to sense, In's Works, reueales him t'our intelligence: There-in, our fingers feel, our nostrils smell, Our palats taste his vertues that excell: He shewes him to our eyes, talkes to our eares, In th'ord'red motions of the spangled Sphears. Sundry comparisons, shewing what vse Christians should make in considering the works of God in this mighty World.The World's a School, where (in a generall Story) God alwaies reads dumb Lectures of his Glory: A paire of Staires, whereby our mounting Soule Ascends by steps aboue the Arched Pole: A sumptuous Hall, where God (on euery side) His wealthie Shop of wonders opens wide: A Bridge, whereby we may pass-o're (at ease) Of sacred Secrets the broad boundless Seas. The World's a Cloud, through which there shineth cleer, Not fair Latona's quiv'red Darling deer; But the true Phœbus, whose bright countenance Through thickest vail of darkest night doth glance. The World's a Stage, where Gods Omnipotence, His Iustice, Knowledge, Loue, and Prouidence, Do act their Parts; contending (in their kindes) Aboue the Heav'ns to rauish dullest mindes. The World's a Book in Folio, printed all VVith God's great Works in letters Capitall: Each Creature is a Page; and each Effect, A faire Character, void of all defect. But, as young Trewants, toying in the Schools, In steed of learning, learne to play the fools: VVe gaze but on the Babies and the Couer, The gawdy Flowrs, and Edges gilded-ouer; And heuer farther for our Lesson look VVithin the Volume of this various Book; VVhere learned Nature rudest ones instructs, That, by His wisedome, God the World conducts. To read This Book, we need not vnderstand Although the world discouer sufficiently euen to the most rude the Eternity &amp; Power of God: Yet only the true Christians do rightly conceiue it. Each strangers gibbrish; neither take in hand Turks Characters, nor Hebrew Points to seek, Nyle's Hieroglyphikes, nor the Notes of Greeke. The wandring Tartars, the Antarticks wilde, Th'Alarbies fierce, the Scythians fell, the Childe Scarce seav'n yeare old, the bleared aged eye, Though void of Art, reade heer indifferently. But he that wears the spectacles of Faith, Sees through the Sphears, aboue the highest heighth: He comprehends th'Arch-moouer of all Motions, And reads (though running) all these needfull Notions. Therefore, by Faith's pure rayes illumined, These sacred Pandects I desire to read, And (God the better to behold) behold Th'Orb from his Birth, in's Ages manifold. Th'admired Author's Fancie, fixed not God, needing no Idea, nor premeditation, nor Patterne of his work, of nothing made all the World. On some fantastik fore-conceited Plot: Much less did he an elder World erect, By form whereof, he might his Frame erect: As th'Architect that Buildeth for a Prince Some stately Palace, yer he do commence His Royall VVork, makes choice of such a Court VVhere cost and cunning equally consort: And if he finde not in one Edifice All answerable to his queint deuice; From this faire Palace then he takes his Front, From that his Finials; here he learns to mount His curious Stairs, there finds he Frise and Cornish, And other Places other Peeces furnish; And so, selecting euery where the best, Doth thirty Models in one House digest. Nothing, but Nothing, had the Lord Almighty, Whereof, wherewith, whereby, to build this Citie: Yet, when he, Heav'ns, Aire, Earth, and Sea, did frame, He sought not far, he sweat not for the same: A fit Simile to that purpose.As Sol, without descending from the sky, Crowns the fair Spring in painted brauery; Withouten trauaile causeth th'Earth to beare, And (far off) makes the World young euery yeare. The Power and Will, th'affection and effect, The Work and Proiect of this Architect, March all at once: all to his pleasure ranges, Who Alwaies One, his purpose neuer changes. Yet did this Nothing not at once receiue Of Nothing, God created the matter, whereunto afterward he gaue the form &amp; figure which now we behold in the creatures.Matter and Forme: For, as we may perceiue That He, who means to build a warlike Fleet, Makes first prouision of all matter meet (As Timber, Iron, Canuase, Cord, and Pitch) And when all's ready; then appointeth, which Which peece for Planks, which plank shall line the Waste, The Poup and Prow, which Fir shall make a mast; As Art and Vse directeth, heedfully, His hand, his tool, his iudgement, and his eye. So God, before This Frame he fashioned, I wote not what great Word he vttered From's sacred mouth; which summon'd in a Masse Whatsoeuer now the Heav'ns wide arms embrace. But, where the Ship-wright, for his gainfull trade, Findes all his stuffe to's hand already made; Th'Almighty makes his, all and euery part, Without the help of others Wit or Art. That first World (yet) was a most formless Form, What that new created Chaos was, before God gaue it form, figure, place, and situation.A confus'd Heap, a Chaos most deform, A Gulf of Gulfs, a Body ill compackt, An vgly medley, where all difference lackt: Where th'Elements lay iumbled all together, Where hot and colde were iarring each with either; The blunt with sharp, the dank against the drie, The hard with soft, the base against the high, Bitter with sweet: and while this brawl did last, The Earth in Heav'n, the Heav'n in Earth was plac't: Earth, Aire, and Fire, were with the Water mixt; Water, Earth, Aire, within the Fire were fixt; Fire, Water, Earth, did in the Aire abide; Aire, Fire, and Water, in the Earth did hide. For yet th'immortall, mighty Thunder-darter, The Lord high-Marshall, vnto each his quarter Had not assigned: the Celestiall Arks Were not yet spangled with their fiery sparks: As yet no flowrs with odours Earth reuiued: No scaly shoals yet in the Waters diued: Nor any Birds, with warbling harmony, Were born as yet through the transparent Sky. All, All was void of beauty, rule, and light; All without fashion, soule, and motion, quite. Gens. 1. 2. Fire was no fire, the Water was no water, Aire was no aire, the Earth no earthly matter. Or if one could, in such a World, spy forth The Fire, the Aire, the Water, and the Earth; Th'Earth was not firme, the Fier was not hot, Th'Aire was not light, the Water cooled not. Briefly, suppose an Earth, poore, naked, vaine, All void of verdure, without Hill or Plaine, A Heav'n vn-hangd, vn-turning, vn-transparent, Vn-garnished, vn-gilt with Stars apparent; So maist thou ghesse what Heav'n and Earth was that, Where, in confusion, raigned such debate: A Heau'n and Earth for my base stile most fit, Not as they were, but as they were not, yet. This was not then the World: 'twas but the Matter, The Chaos how to be considered. The Nurcery whence it should issue after; Or rather, th'Embryon, that within a Weeke Was to be born: for that huge lump was like A simile. The shape-less burthen in the Mothers womb, Which yet in Time doth into fashion com: Eyes, eares, and nose, mouth, fingers, hands, and feet, And euery member in proportion meet; Round, large, and long, there of it selfe it thriues, And (Little-World) into the World arriues. But that becomes (by Natures set direction) From foul and dead, to beauty, life, perfection. But this dull Heap of vndigested stuf Had doubtless neuer come to shape or proof, Had not th'Almighty with his quick'ning breath Of the secret power of God in quickning the matter whereof the World was made. Blow'n life and spirit into this Lump of death. The dreadfull Darknes of the Memphytists, The sad black horror of Cimmerian Mists, The sable fumes of Hell's infernall vault (Or if ought darker in the World be thought) Muffled the face of that profound Abyss, Full of Disorder and fell Mutinies: So that (in fine) this furious debate Euen in the birth this Ball had ruinate, Saue that the Lord into the Pile did pour Some secret Mastick of his sacred Power, To glew together, and to gouern faire The Heav'n and Earth, the Ocean, and the Aire; VVho ioyntly iustling, in their rude Disorder, The new-borne Nature went about to murder. The Spirit of God, by an inconceiuable meane, maintained, and (as it were brooding) warmed the shape-lesse Masse. Genes. 1.As a good Wit, that on th'immortall Shrine Of Memory, ingraues a Work Diuine, Abroad, a-bed, at boord, for euer vses To minde his Theam, and on his Book still muses: So did Gods Spirit delight it selfe a space To moue it selfe vpon the floting Masse: No other care th'Almightie's mind possest (If care can enter in his sacred brest). Or, as a Hen that fain would hatch a Brood (Some of her owne, some of adoptiue blood) Sits close thereon, and with her liuely heat, Of yellow-white bals, doth lyue birds beget: Euen in such sort seemed the Spirit Eternall To brood vpon this Gulf; with care paternall Quickning the Parts, inspiring power in each, From so foul Lees, so faire a World to fetch. For 't's nought but All, in't selfe including All; An vn-beginning, midless, endless Ball. 'Tis nothing but a World, whose superfice Leaues nothing out, but what meer nothing is. That ther is but one World: confuting the Error of Leucippus &amp; his Disciples, by two reasons.Now, though the great Duke, that (in dreadfull aw) Vpon Mount Horeb learn'd th'eternall Law, Had not assur'd vs that Gods sacred Power In six Daies built this Vniuersall Bower; Reason it selfe doth ouer-throw the grounds Of those new Worlds that fond Leucippus founds: Sith, if kinde Nature many Worlds could embrace. clip, Still th'vpper World's water and earth would slip Into the lower; and so in conclusion, All would returne into the Old Confusion. Besides, we must imagin empty distance Between these Worlds, wherein, without resistance Their wheels may whirle, not hindred in their courses, By th'inter-iustling of each others forces: But, all things are so fast together fixt With so firme bonds, that there's no voyd betwixt. Thence comes it, that a Cask pearc't to be spent, Though full, yet runs not till we giue it vent. Thence is't that Bellowes, while the snout is stopt, So hardly heaue, and hardly can be op't. Thence is't that water doth not freeze in Winter, Stopt close in vessels where no aire may enter. Thence is't that Garden-pots, the mouth kept close, Let fall no liquor at their fiue-like nose. And thence it is, that the pure siluer source, In leaden pipes running a captiue course, Contrary to it's nature, spouteth high: To all, so odious is Vacuitie. God then, not only framed Nature one, Confutation of another Error of such as make Nature and the Heauens infinit. But also set it limitation Of Forme and Time: exempting euer solely From quantity his owne self's Essence holy. How can we call the Heav'ns vnmeasured? Sith measur'd Time their Course hath measured. How can we count this Vniuerse immortall? Sith many-waies the parts proue howerly mortall: Sith his Commencement proues his Consummation, And all things aye decline to alteration. Let bold Greek Sages fain the Firmament To be compos'd of a fift Element: Let them deny, in their profane profoundnes, End and beginning to th'Heav'ns rowling roundnes: And let them argue, that Deaths lawes alone Reach but the Bodies vnder Cynthias Throne: The sandy grounds of their Sophistick brawling Are all too-weake to keep the World from falling. One Day, the Rocks from top to toe shall quiuer, A liuely description of the end of the world. The mountaines melt and all in sunder shiuer: The Heav'ns shall rent for feare; the lowely Fields, Puft vp, shall swell to huge and mighty Hils: Riuers shall dry: or if in any Flood Rest any liquor, it shall all be blood: The Sea shall all be fire, and on the shoar The thirsty Whales with horrid noyse shall roar: The Sun shall seize the black Coach of the Moon, And make it midnight when it should be noon: With rusty Mask the Heauens shall hide their face, The Stars shall fall, and all away shall pass: Disorder, Dread, Horror, and Death shall come, Noise, Storms, and Darkness shall vsurp the roome. And then the Chief-Chief-Iustice, venging Wrath (Which heer already often threatned hath) Shall make a Bon-fire of this mighty Ball, As once he made it a vast Ocean all. Alas! how faith-less and how modest-less Against iudicial Astrologers, that presume to point the very time thereof. Are you, that (in your Ephemerides) Mark th'yeer, the month and day, which euermore Gainst years, months, dayes, shall dam-vp Saturnes dore! (At thought whereof, euen now, my heart doth ake, My flesh doth faint, my very soule doth shake) You haue mis-cast in your Arithmetick, Mis-laid your Counters, groapingly yee seek In Nights black darknes for the secret things Seal'd in the Casket of the King of Kings. 'Tis hee, that keeps th'eternall Clock of Time, And holds the weights of that appointed Chime: Hee in his hand the sacred booke doth bear Of that close-clasped finall Calendar, Where, in Red letters (now with vs frequented) The certaine Date of that Great Day is printed; That dreadfull Day, which doth so swiftly post, That 'twill be seen, before fore-seen of most. Then, then (good Lord) shall thy dear Son descend. (Though yet hee seem in feeble flesh y pend) In complete Glory, from the glistering Skie: Millions of Angels shall about him flie: Mercy and Iustice, marching cheek by ioule, Shall his Diuine Triumphant Chariot roule; Whose wheeles shall shine with Lightning round about, And beames of Glory each-where blazing out. Those that were loaden with proud marble Toombs, Those that were swallow'd in wild Monsters woombs, Those that the Sea hath swill'd, those that the flashes Of ruddy Flames haue burned all to ashes, Awaked all, shall rise, and all reuest The flesh and bones that they at first possest. All shall appear, and heare before the Throne Of God (the Iudge without exception) The finall Sentence (sounding ioy and terror) Of euer-lasting Happiness or Horror. Some shall his Iustice, some his Mercy taste; Some call'd to ioy, some into torment cast, VVhen from the Goats he shall his Sheep disseuer; These Blest in Heav'n, those Curst in Hell for euer. O thou that once (scornd as the vilest drudge) Didst bear the doom of an Italian Iudge, Daign (deerest Lord) when the last Trump shall summon, To this Grand Sessions, all the World in common; Daign in that Day to vndertake my matter: And, as my Iudge so be my Mediator. Hauing spoken of the creation of the Matter, he sheweth how &amp; what Forme God gaue vnto it, creating in six Daies his admirable works.Th'eternall Spring of Power and Prouidence, In Forming of this All-circumference, Did not vnlike the Bear, which bringeth-forth In th'end of thirty daies a shapeless birth; But after, licking, it in shape she drawes, And by degrees she fashions out the pawes, The head, and neck, and finally doth bring To a perfect beast that first deformed thing. For when his Word in the vast Voyd had brought A confus'd heap of Wet-dry-cold-and-hot, In time the high World from the lowe he parted, And by it selfe, hot vnto hot he sorted; Hard vnto hard, cold vnto cold he sent; Moist vnto moist, as was expedient. And so in Six Dayes form'd ingeniously All things contain'd in th'Vniversitie. Not but he could haue, in a moment, made Wherefore God imployed six Daies in creating the World. This flowry Mansion where mankind doth trade; Spred Heav'ns blew Curtains &amp; those Lamps haue burnisht; Earth, aire, and sea; with beasts, birds, fish, haue furnisht: But, working with such Art so many dayes, A sumptuous Palace for Mankinde to raise, Yer Man was made yet; he declares to vs, How kinde, how carefull, and how gracious, He would be to vs being made, to whom By thousand promises of things to-come (Vnder the Broad-Seal of his deere Sons blood) He hath assur'd all Riches, Grace, and Good. By his Example he doth also shew-vs, How men should imitate God in his works. We should not heedless-hastily bestowe vs In any Work, but patiently proceed With oft re-vises Making sober speed In dearest business, and obserue by proof, That; What is well done, is done soon enough. O Father of the Light! of Wisedom fountain; The 1. creature, extracted form the Chaos, was Light. Out of the Bulk of that confused Mountain What should (what could) issue, before the Light? Without which, Beauty were no beauty hight. In vain Timanthes had his Cyclop drawn, In vain Parrhasius counterfeited Lawn, In vain Apelles Venus had begun, Zeuxis Penelope; if that the Sun, To make them seen, had neuer showen his splendor: In vain, in vain, had been (those Works of Wonder) Th'Ephesian Temple, and high Pharian-Tower, And Carian Toomb (Tropheis of Wealth and Power) In vain had they been builded euery one, By Scopas, Sostrates, and Ctesiphon; Had All been wrapt-vp from all humane sight, In th'obscure Mantle of eternall Night. What one thing more doth the good Architect In Princely Works (more specially) respect, Then lightsomness? to th'end the Worlds bright Eye, Careering daily once about the Sky, May shine therein; and that in euery part It may seem pompous both for Cost and Art. Sundry opinions concerning the matter, and creation of Light.Whether Gods Spirit mouing vpon the Ball Of bubbling Waters (which yet couered All) Thence forc't the Fire (as when amid the Sky Auster and Boreas iusting furiously Vnder hot Cancer, make two clouds to clash, Whence th'aire at mid-night flames with lightning flash): Whether, when God the mingled Lump dispackt, From Fiery Element did Light extract: Whether about the vast confused Crowd For twice six-howrs he spread a shining Cloud, Which after he re-darkned, that in time The Night as long might wrap-vp either Clime: Whether that God made, then, those goodly beams Which gild the World, but not as now it seems: Or whether else some other Lamp he kindled Vpon the Heap (yet all with Waters blindled) Which flying round about, gaue light in order To th'vnplac't Climates of that deep disorder; As now the Sun, circling about the Ball (The Light's bright Chariot) doth enlighten All. Gen. 1. 3.No sooner said he, Be there Light, but lo The form-less Lump to perfect Form gan growe; And, all illustred with Lights radiant shine, Doft mourning weeds, and deckt it passing fine. Of the excellent vse and commoditie of Light.All-hail pure Lamp, bright, sacred and excelling; Sorrow and Care, Darknes and Dread repelling: Thou World's great Taper, Wicked mens iust Terror, Mother of Truth, true Beauties only Mirror, Gods eldest Daughter: O! how thou art full Of grace and goodnes! O! how beautifull! Sith thy great Parent's all-discerning Eye Doth iudge thee so: and sith his Maiesty (Thy glorious Maker) in his sacred layes Can doo no less then sing thy modest prayse. Why God ordained the Night and Day alternatly to succeed each other.But yet, because all Pleasures wex vnpleasant, If without pawse we still possesse them, present; And none can right discerne the sweets of Peace, That haue not felt Wars irkesom bitterness; And Swans seem whiter if swart Crowes be by (For, Contraries each other best discry) Th'All's-Archietect, alternately decreed That Night the Day, the Day should Night succeed. The commoditie that the Night bringeth us.The Night, to temper Daies exceeding drought, Moistens our Aire, and makes our Earth to sprout. The Night is she that all our trauailes easeth, Buries our cares, and all our griefs appeaseth. The Night is she, that (with her sable wing, In gloomy Darknes hushing euery thing) Through all the World dumb silence doth distill, And wearied bones with quiet sleep doth fill. Sweet Night, without Thee, without Thee (alas!) Our life were loathsom; euen a Hell to pass: For, outward paines and inward passions still, With thousand Deaths, would soule and body thrill. O Night, thou pullest the proud Mask away Where-with vaine Actors, in this Worlds great Play, By Day disguise-them. For, no difference Night makes between the Peasant and the Prince, The poore and rich, the Prisoner and the Iudge, The foul and faire, the Master and the Drudge, The foole and wise, Barbarian and the Greek: For, Night's black Mantle couers all alike. He that, condemn'd for some notorious vice, Seeks in the Mines the baits of Auarice; Or, swelting at the Furnace, fineth bright Our soules dire sulphur; resteth yet at night. He that, still stooping, toghes against the tide His laden Barge alongst a Riuers side, And filling shoares with shouts, doth melt him quite; Vpon his pallet resteth yet at Night. He, that in Sommer, in extreamest heat Scorched all day in his owne scalding sweat, Shaues, with keen Sythe, the glory and delight Of motly Medowes; resteth yet at Night, And in the arms of his deer Pheer forgoes All former troubles and all former woes. Onely the learned Sisters sacred Minions, While silent Night vnder her sable pinions Foldes all the World, with pain-lesse paine they tread A sacred path that to the Heav'ns doth lead; And higher then the Heav'ns their Readers raise Vpon the wings of their immortall Layes. Even Novv I listned for the Clock to chime Before he conclude the first Day, he treateth of Angels. Dayes latest hower; that for a little time, The Night might ease My Labours: but, I see As yet Aurora hath scarce smil'd on me; My Work still growes: for, now before mine eyes Heav'ns glorious Hoast in nimble squadrons flyes. Whether, This-Day, God made you, Angels bright, The time of their Creati? not certainly resolued. Vnder the name of Heav'n, or of the Light: Whether you were, after, in th'instant borne With those bright Spangles that the Heav'ns adorne: Or, whether you deriue your high Descent Long time before the World and Firmament (For, I nill stifly argue to and fro In nice Opinions, whether so, or so; Especially, where curious search, perchance, Is not so safe as humble Ignorance); I am resolv'd that once th'Omnipotent Created you immortall, innocent, Good, faire, and free; in briefe, of Essence such As from his Owne differd not very much. Som of them are fallen, reuolting from God: and are cast into Hell, therefore called Euil Angels, Wicked Spirits and Deuils.But euen as those, whom Princes fauours oft Aboue the rest haue rais'd and set-aloft, Are oft the first that (without right or reason) Attempt Rebellion and do practice Treason; And so, at length are iustly tumbled down Beneath the foot, that raught aboue the Crown: Euen so, some Legions of those lofty Spirits (Enuying the glory of their Makers merits) Conspir'd together, stroue against the streame, T'vsurpe his Scepter and his Diademe. But He, whose hands doe neuer Lightnings lack Proud sacrilegious Mutiners to wrack, Hurld them in th'Aire, or in some lower Cell: For, where God is not, euery where is Hell. This cursed Crew, with Pride and Fury fraught, Of vs, at least, haue this aduantage got, That by experience they can truely tell How far it is from highest Heav'n to Hell: For, by a proud leap they haue tane the measure, When headlong thence they tumbled in displeasure. The insolent and audacious attempts of Satan and his Fellows against God and his Church.These Fiends are so far-off from bett'ring them By this hard Iudgement, that still more extream, The more their plague, the more their pride encreases, The more their rage: as Lizards, cut in peeces, Threat with more malice, though with lesser might, And euen in dying shew their liuing spight. For, euer since, against the King of Heav'n Th'Apostate Prince of Darknes still hath striv'n, Striv'n to depraue his Deeds t'interr their Story, T'vndoo his Church, to vnder-mine his Glory; To reaue this World's great Body, Ship, and State, Of Head, of Master, and of Magistrate. But, finding still the Maiesty diuine Too strongly fenc't for him to vnder-mine; His Ladders, Canons, and his Engines, all Force-less to batter the celestiall Wall; Too weak to hurt the Head, he hacks the Members: The Tree too hard, the Branches he dismembers. The Fowlers, Fishers, and the Foresters, Set not so many toyls and baits, and snares, To take the Fowle, the Fish, the sauage Beasts, In Woods, and Floods, and fear-full Wilderness: As this false Spirit sets Engines to beguile The cunningest that practice nought but wile. With wanton glance of Beauties burning eye The diuers baits of the Diuell to entrap mankind. He snares hot Youth in sensuality. With Gold's bright lustre doth he Age intice To Idolize detested Auarice. With grace of Princes, with their pomp, and State, Ambitious Spirits he doth intoxicate. With curious Skill-pride, and vain dreams, he witches Those that contemn Pleasure, and State, and Riches. Yea, Faith it selfe, and Zeale, be sometimes Angles Wherewith this Iuggler Heav'n-bent Soules intangles: Much like the green Worm, that in Spring deuours The buds and leaues of choisest Fruits and Flowrs; Turning their sweetest sap and fragrant verdure To deadly poyson, and detested ordure. Who but (alas!) would haue been gull'd yer-whiles Their Oracles. With Night's black Monark's most malicious wiles? To heare Stones speak, to see strange wooden Miracles, And golden Gods to vtter wondrous Oracles? To see Him play the Prophet, and inspire So many Sibyls with a sacred fire? To raise dead Samuel from his silent Toomb, 1. Sam. 28. 14. 17. To tell his King Calamities to-come? T'inflame the Flamine of Ioue Ammon so With Heathen-holy fury-fits to knowe Future euents, and somtimes truely tell The blinded World what afterwards befell? To counterfait the wondrous Works of God; Their false Miracles. Exod. 7. 11. 22. &amp; 8. 7. His Rod turn Serpent, and his Serpent Rod? To change the pure streams of th'Egyptian Flood From clearest water into crimsin blood? To rain-down Frogs, and Grass-hoppers to bring In the bed-chambers of the stubborn King? For, as he is a Spirit, vnseen he sees The plots of Princes, and their Policies; Vnfelt, he feeles the depth of their desires; Who harbours vengeance, and whose heart aspires: And, as vs'd daily vnto such effects, Such feats and fashions, iudges of th'effects. Their Wiles. Besides, to circumvent the quickest sprighted, To blind the eyes euen of the clearest sighted, And to enwrap the wisest in his snares, He oft foretels what hee himselfe prepares. Wherefore their effects are so strange and wonderfull. For, if a Wise-man (though Mans daies be don As soon almost as they be heer begun; And his dul Flesh be of too slowe a kinde T'ensue the nimble Motions of his minde) By th'onely power of Plants and Minerals Can work a thousand super-naturals: Who but will think, much more these Spirits can Work strange effects, exceeding sense of Man? Sith, being immortall, long experience brings Them certain knowledge of th'effects of things; And, free from bodie's clog, with less impeach, And lighter speed, their bold Designes they reach. God restraines them at his pleasure.Not that they haue the bridle on their neck, To run at random without curb or check, T'abuse the Earth, and all the World to blinde, And tyrannize our bodie and our minde. God holds them chain'd in Fetters of his Power; That, without leaue, one minute of an hower They cannot range. It was by his permission, 1. King. 22. 35.The Lying Spirit train'd Achab to perdition; Making him march against that Foe with force, Which should his body from his soule diuorce. Arm'd with Gods sacred Pass-port, he did try Iob 1. 15. &amp;c.Iust humble Iob's renowned Constancy: He reaues him all his Cattell, many wayes, By Fire and Foes: his faithfull Seruants slayes: To loss of Goods he adds his Childrens loss, And heaps vpon him bitter cross on cross. For th'Only Lord, sometimes to make a tryall Why the Lord sometimes lets loose these wicked Spirits.Of firmest Faith, somtimes with Errors violl To drench the Soules that Errors sole delight, Lets loose these Furies: who with fell despight Driue still the same Nail, and pursue (incensed) Their damned drifts in Adam first commenced. But, as these Rebels (maugre all that will) Of the good Angels seruing to the glory of God, and good of his Church both in generall &amp; particular.T'assist the Good, be forc't t'assault the Ill: Th'vnspotted Spirits that neuer did intend To mount too high, nor yet too lowe descend, With willing speed they euery moment goe Whither the breath of diuine grace doth blowe: Their aimes had neuer other limitation Then God's owne glory, and his Saints saluation. Law-less Desire ne'r enters in their breast, Th'Almightie's Face is their Ambrosiall Feast: Repentant tears of strayed Lambs returning, Their Nectar sweet: their Musick, Sinners Mourning. Ambitious Man's greedy Desire doth gape Scepter on Scepter, Crown on Crown to clap: These neuer thirst for greater Dignities. Trauail's their ease, their bliss in seruice lies. For, God no sooner hath his pleasure spoken, Or bow'd his head, or giuen som other token, Or (almost) thought on an Exploit, wherein The Ministery of Angels shall be seen, But these quick Postes with ready expedition Flie to accomplish their diuine Commission. One followes Agar in her pilgrimage, Gen. 21. 17. 18. And with sweet comforts doth her cares asswage. Another guideth Isaacs mighty Hoasts; Exod. 23. 23. &amp; 33. 2.

Another mowes-down in a moments space, Before Ierusalem (Gods chosen place) Senacharib's proud ouer-daring Hoast, That threatned Heav'n, and 'gainst the Earth did boast; In his blasphemous Braues, comparing ev'n His Idol-Gods, vnto the God of Heav'n. His Troups, victorious in the East before, Besieg'd the Citie, which did sole adore The onely God; so that, without their leaue, A Sparrow scarce the sacred Wals could leaue. Then Ezechias, as a prudent Prince, Poyzing the danger of these sad euents (His Subiects thrall, his Cities wofull Flames, His childrens death, the rape of noble Dames, The Massacre of Infants and of Eld, And's Royall Selfe with thousand weapons queld; The Temple raz'd, th'Altar and Censer void Of sacred vse, Gods Seruants all destroid) Humbled in Sack-cloath and in Ashes, cries For aid to God, the God of Victories; Who heares his suit, and thunders down his Fury On those proud Pagan Enemies of Iury. For, while their Watch within their Corps de Garde About the Fire securely snorted hard, From Heav'n th'Almighty looking sternly down (Glancing his Friends a smile, his Foes a frown) A sacred Fencer 'gainst th'Assyrians sent, Whose two-hand Sword, at euery veny, slent, Not through a single Souldiers feeble bones, But keenly slyces through whole Troops at once; And heaws broad Lanes before it and behinde, As swiftly whirling as the whisking winde. Now gan they fly; but all too slowe to shun A flying Sword that follow'd euery one. A Sword they saw; but could not see the arm That in one Night had done so dismall harm: As we perceiue a Winde-mils sails to go; But not the Winde, that doth transport them so. Blushing Aurora, had yet scarce dismist Mount Libanus from the Nights gloomy Mist, When th'Hebrew Sentinels, discov'ring plain An hundred foure score and fiue thousand slain, Exceeding ioyfull, gan to ponder stricter, To see such conquest and not know the Victor. O sacred Tutors of the Saints! you Guard Of Gods Elect, you Pursuiuants prepar'd To execute the Counsails of the Highest; You Heav'nly Courtiers, to your King the nighest; Gods glorious Heralds, Heav'ns swift Harbengers, 'Twixt Heav'n and Earth you true Interpreters; I could be well content and take delight To follow farther your celestiall Flight; But that I feare (heer hauing ta'n in hand So long a iourney both by Sea and Land) I feare to faint, if at the first (too fast I cut away, and make too-hasty haste: For, Trauailers, that burn in braue desire To see strange Countries manners and attire, Make haste enough, if only the First Day From their owne Sill they set but on their way. So Morne and Euening the First Day conclude, And God perceiu'd that All his Works were good. THE SECOND DAY OF THE FIRST WEEK. The Argvment. Lewd Poets checkt: Our Poets chast Intents: Heav'ns Curtain spread: th'all forming Elements; Their number, nature, vse and Domination, Content, excesse, continuance, situation: Aire's triple Regions; and their Temper's change: Windes, Exhalations, and all Metors strange; Th'effects, the vse (apply'd to Conscience): Mans Reason non-plust in some Accidents: Of Prodigies: of th'Elementall Flame: Heav'ns ten fold Orbs: Waters aboue the same. Those learned Spirits, whose wits applied wrong, A iust reproof of wanton &amp; lasciuious Poets of our Time. With wanton Charms of their inchanting song, Make of an olde, foul, franticke Hecuba, A wondrous fresh, faire, wittie Helena: Of lewd Faustina (that loose Emperess) A chaste Lucretia, loathing wantonness: Of a blinde Bowe-Boy, of a Dwarf, a Bastard, No petty Godling, but the Gods great Master; On thankless furrowes of a fruitless sand Their seed and labour lose, with heedless hand; And (pitching Nets, to catch I little wott What fume of Fame that seems them to besott) Resemble Spiders, that with curious pain Weaue idle Webs, and labour still in vain. But (though then Time we haue no deerer Treasure) Loss should I wail their miss-expence of leasure, If their sweet Muse, with too-well spoken Spell, Drew not their Readers with themselues to Hell. For, vnder th'hony of their learned Works A hatefull draught of deadly poyson lurks: Whereof (alas) Young spirits quaffe so deep, The danger of their seduced Readers.That drunk with Loue, their Reason fals asleep; And such a habit their fond Fancy gets, That their ill stomack still loues euill meats. Th'inchanting force of their sweet Eloquence Hurls headlong down their tender Audience, Aye (childe-like) sliding, in a foolish strife, On th'Icie down-Hils of this slippery Life. The Songs their Phœbus doth so sweet inspire, Are euen the Bellowes whence they blowe the fire Of raging Lust (before) whose wanton flashes A tender brest rak't-vp in shamefac't ashes. Our Poets modest purpose.Therefore, for my part I haue vow'd to Heav'n Such wit and learning as my God hath giv'n; To write, to th'honour of my Maker dread, Verse that a Virgine without blush may read. Again, he calls vpon God, for assistance in the description of the second Days work.Cleare Source of Learning, soule of th'Vniuerse (Sith thou art pleas'd to chuse mine humble Verse To sing thy Praises) make my Pen distill Celestiall Nectar, and this Volume fill With th'Amalthean Horn; that it may haue Some correspondence to a Theam so graue: Rid thou my passage, and make cleare my way From all incumbers: shine vpon This Day; That guided safely by thy sacred Light, My Rendez-vous I may attaine yer night. Which is the Firmam?t mentioned by Moses in the 1. Ch. of Gen. V. 6. 7. 8. Comprehending the Heauens, &amp; all the Elementary Region. Of the foure Elements, simple in themselues: wherof al things subiect to our sense, are composed. That Hvge broad-length, that long-broad height profound, Th'infinite finite, that great moundless Mound, I meane that Chaos, that self-iarring Mass, Which in a moment made of Nothing was; Was the rich Matter and the Matrix, whence The Heav'ns should issue, and the Elements. Now th'Elements twin-twins (two Sons, two Daughters) To wit, the Fire, the Aire; the Earth, and Waters Are not compounded: but, of them is all Compounded first, that in our sense can fall: Whether their qualities, in euery portion Of euery thing, infuse them with proportion: Whether in all, their substance they confound, And so but one thing of their foure compound: As in a Venice Glass, before our eyne, Diuers Similes.We see the water intermix with wine: Or, in our stomack, as our drink and food Doe mingle, after to conuert to blood. This in a Fire-brand may we see, whose Fire Doth in his Flame toward's natiue Heav'n aspire, His Aire in smoak; in ashes fals his Earth, And at his knots his Water wheezes forth. Euen such a War our Bodies peace maintains. For, in our Flesh, our Bodie's Earth remains: Our vitall spirits, our Fire and Aire possess: And, last, our Water in our humours rests. Nay, ther's no Part in all this Bulk of ours, Where each of these not intermix their powers; Though't be apparent (and I needs must grant) That aye some one is most Predominant. The pure red part, amid the Mass of Blood, The Sanguine Aire commands: the clutted mud, Sunk down in Lees, Earths Melancholy showes: The pale thin, humor, that on th'out-side flowes, Is watery Phlegme: and the light froathy scum, Bubbling aboue, hath Fiery Cholers room. Not, that at all times, one same Element A vicissitude of the Elements prædominance. In one same Body hath the Regiment: But, by turns raigning, each his subiects drawes After his Lore: for, still New Lords new Lawes; As sans respect how Rich or Noble-born, Each Citizen rules and obayes, by turn, In chart'red Towns; which seem, in little space, Changing their Ruler, euen to change their face (For, as Chameleons vary with their obiect, So Princes manners do transform the Subiect): So th'Element in Wine predomining, It hot, and cold, and moist, and dry doth bring; By's perfect or imperfect force (at length) Inforcing it to change the taste and strength: So that it doth Grapes sharp-green iuice transfer To Must, Must t'Wine, and Wine to Vineger. As while a Monarch, to teach others aw, Excell?t Similes shewing the commodity or discommodity of the proportion or excesse of euery of the Elements. Subiects his owne selfs-Greatness to his Law, He ruleth fearless: and his Kingdoms flourish In happy Peace (and Peace doth Plenty nourish); But if (fell Tyrant) his keen sword be euer Vniustly drawn, if he be sated neuer With Subiects blood; needs must his Rage (at last) Destroy his State, and lay his Countrie waste: So (or much like) the while one Element Ouer the rest hath modest Gouernment; While, in proportion (though vnequall yet) With Soueraign Humours Subiect Humours fit, The Bodie's sound; and in the very face Retains the Form of beauty and of grace: But if (like that inhumane Emperour Who wisht, all People vnderneath his Power Had but one head, that he might butcher so All th'Empires Subiects at one only blowe) It, Tyrannizing, seek to wrack the rest, It ruines soon the Prouince it possest; Where soon appears, through his proud vsurpation, Both outward change, and inward alteration. Excesse of moisture.So, too-much Moist, which (vnconcoct within) The Liuer spreads betwixt the flesh and skin, Puffs vp the Patient, stops the pipes and pores Of Excrements: yea, double bais the dores Of his short breath, and slowly-swiftly curst, In midd'st of Water makes him euer thirst: Nor giues man Rest, nor Respite, till his bones Be raked vp in a cold heap of stones. Of Drought.So too-much Drought a lingring Ague drawes, Which seeming pain-less, yet much pain doth cause, Robbing the nerues of might, of ioy the heart, Of mirth the face, of moisture euery part (Much like a Candle fed with it owne humour, By little and little it owne selfs consumer) Nor giues man Rest, nor Respite, till his bones Be raked vp in a cold heap of stones. Of Heate.So, too-much Heat doth bring a burning Feuer, Which spurrs our Pulse, and furrs our Palat euer; And on the tables of our troubled brain, Fantastickly with various pensill vain Doth counterfait as many Forms, or moe Then euer Nature, Art, or Chance could showe: Nor giues man Rest, nor Respite till his bones Be raked vp in a cold heap of stones. Of Colde.So, too-much Cold couers with hoary Fleece The head of Age, his flesh diminishes, Withers his face, hollowes his rheumy eyes, And makes himselfe euen his owne selfe despise; While through his marrow euery where it enters, Quenching his natiue heat with endless Winters: Nor giues man Rest, nor Respite, till his bones Of the continuance of the Elements, maintaining that whatsoeuer is now new formed, hath all his substance from the Materia prima: &amp; whatsoeuer dissolues, resolues into the same, changing onely form: and also confuting the contrary Errors.Be raked vp in a cold heap of stones. Yet think not, that this Too-too-Much, remises Ought into nought: it but the Form disguises In hundred fashions, and the Substances Inly, or outly, neither win nor leese. For, all that's made, is made of the First Matter Which in th'old Nothing made the All-Creator. All, that dissolues, resolues into the same. Since first the Lord of Nothing made This Frame, Nought's made of nought; and nothing turns to nothing: Things birth, or death, change but their formall clothing: Their forms do vanish, but their bodies bide; Now thick, now thin, now round, now short, now side. For, if of Nothing any thing could spring, Th'Earth without seed should wheat and barly bring: Pure Mayden-woombs desired Babes should bear: All things, at all times, should grow euery where. The Hart in Water should it selfe ingender; The Whale on Land; in Aire the Lambling tender: Th'Ocean should yeeld the Pine and Cornell Tree; On Hazels Acornes, Nuts on Oaks should be: And breaking Natures set and sacred vse, The Doues would Eagles, Eagles Doues, produce. If of themselues things took their thriuing, then Slowe-growing Babes should instantly be Men: Then in the Forests should huge boughes be seen Born with the bodies of vnplanted Treen: Then should the sucking Elephant support Vpon his shoulders a well-manned Fort; And the new foaled Colt, couragious, Should neigh for Battail, like Bucephalus. Contrariwise, if ought to nought did fall; All, that is felt or seen within this All, Still losing somwhat of it selfe, at length Would come to Nothing: If Death's fatall strength Could altogether Substances destroy, Things then should vanish even as soon as dy. In time the mighty Mountains tops be bated; But, with their fall, the neighbour Vales are fatted; And what, when Trent or Auon ouer-flowe, They reaue one field, they on the next bestowe: Loue-burning Heav'n many sweet Deaws doth drop In his deer Spouses faire and fruitfull lap; Which after she restores, straining those showrs Through th'hidden pores of pleasant plants and flowrs. Whoso hath seen, how one warm lump of wax By an apt similitude, be sheweth the continuall Change of the World, in the matter &amp; form therof, according to Gods pleasure, in such sort, yet, that the matter remains, though is receiue infinite Formes. (Without increasing, or decreasing) takes A hundred figures; well may iudge of all Th'incessant Changes of this neather Ball. The Worlds owne Matter is the waxen Lump, Which, vn-self-changing, takes all kind of stamp: The Form's the Seal; Heav'ns gratious Emperour (The liuing God)'s the great Lord Chancellour; Who at his pleasure setting day and night His great Broad Seales, and Priuy Signets right Vpon the Mass so vast and variable, Makes the same Lump, now base, now honourable. Heer's nothing constant: nothing still doth stay: For, Birth and Death haue still successiue sway. Heer one thing springs not, till another die: Onely the Matter liues immortallie (Th'Almighties Table, body of this All, Of change-full Chances common Arcenall, All like it selfe, all in it selfe contained, Which by Times Flight hath neither lost nor gained) Change-less in Essence; changeable in face, Much more then Proteus, or the subtill race Of rouing Polypes, who (to rob the more) Sundry Similes to that purpose.Transform them howrly on the wauing shore: Much like the French (or like our selues, their Apes) Who with strange habit do disguise their shapes; Who louing nouels, full of affectation, Receiue the Manners of each other Nation; And scarcely shift they shirts so oft, as change Fantastick Fashions of their garments strange: Or like a Laïs, whose inconstant loue Doth euery day a thousand times remoue; Who's scarce vnfolded from one Youths embraces; Yer in her thought another she embraces; And the new pleasure of her wanton Fire Stirs in her, still, another new desire: Because the Matter, wounded deep in heart With various Loue (yet, on the selfe same part, Incapable, in the same time, at once To take all figures) by successions, Form after Form receiues: so that one face Anothers faces features doth deface. The chief motiue of this change of Formes in the matter.Now the chiefe Motiue of these Accidents, Is the dire discord of our Elements; Truce-hating Twins, where Brother eateth Brother By turns, and turn them one into another, Like Ice and Water that beget each other; And still the Daughter bringeth-forth the Mother. Enigma.But each of these hauing two qualities (One bearing Rule, another that obayes) Those, whose effects do wholly contradict, Longer and stronger striue in their Conflict. The hot-dry Fire to cold-moist Water turns not; The cold-dry Earth, to hot-moist Aire, returns not, Returns not eas'ly: for (still opposite) With tooth and nail as deadly foes they fight. But Aire turne Water, Earth may Fierize; Because in one part they do symbolize; And so, in combate they haue less to doo; For, 't's easier far, to conquer one then two. Of the Situation of the Elements, &amp; of the effects therof, compar'd to the Notes of Musik, &amp; to the letters of the Alphabet.Sith then the knot of sacred Mariage, Which ioynes the Elements, from age to age Brings forth the Worlds Babes: sith their Enmities, . With fell diuorce, kill whatsoeuer dies: And sith, but changing their degree and place, They frame the various Forms, wherewith the face Of this fair World is so imbellished [As six sweet Notes, curiously varied In skilfull Musick, make a hundred kindes Of Heav'nly sounds, that rauish hardest mindes; And with Division (of a choice deuice) The Hearers soules out at their ears intice: Or, as of twice-twelue Letters, thus transpos'd, This World of Words, is variously compos'd; And of these Words, in diuers order sowen, This sacred Volume that you read, is growen (Through gracious succour of th'Eternall Deity) Rich in dicourse, with infinite Variety] It was not cause-less, that so carefully. God did diuide their common Signory; Assigning each a fit confined Sitting, Their quantity and quality befitting. Whoso (somtime) hath seen rich Ingots tride, A Simile liuely representing the separation of the Elements. When forc't by Fire their treasures they diuide (How fair and softly Gold to Gold doth pass, Siluer seeks Siluer, Brass consorts with Brass; And the whole Lump, of parts vnequall, seuers It self apart, in white, red, yellow Rivers) May vnderstand how, when the Mouth Diuine Op'ned (to each his proper Place t'assigne) Fire flew to Fire, Water to Water slid, Aire clung to Aire, and Earth with Earth abid. Earth, as the Lees, and heauy dross of All Situation of the Earth and Fire. (After his kinde) did to the bottom fall: Contrariwise, the light and nimble Fire Did through the crannies of th'old Heap aspire Vnto the top; and by his nature, light No less then hot, mounted in sparks vpright: As, when we see Aurora, passing gay, With Opals paint the Seeling of Cathay, Sad Flouds do fume; and the celestiall Tapers, Through Earths thin pores, in th'Aire exhale their vapors. But, lest the Fire (which all the rest imbraces) Being too neer, should burn the Earth to ashes; As chosen Vmpires, the great All-Creator Between these Foes placed the Aire and Water: Of aire &amp; water placed between the earth and fire. For, one suffiz'd not their stern strife to end. Water, as Cozen did the Earth befriend: Aire, for his Kinsman Fire, as firmly deals: But both, vniting their diuided zeals, Took vp the matter, and appeas'd the brall; Which doubt-less else had discreated All. Th'Aire lodg'd aloft, the Water vnder it, Not casually, but so disposed fit By him, who (Nature in her kinde to keep) Kept due proportion in his Workmanship; And, in this Store-house of his Wonders treasure, Observ'd in all things number, waight and measure. Why the Aire was lodged next the Element of Fire.For, had the Water next the Fire been plac't, Fire, seeming then more wrongd and more disgrac't, Would suddenly haue left his Adversary, And set vpon the Vmpire (more contrary). But all the Links of th'holy Chain, which tethers The many Members of the World togethers, Are such, as none but onely He can break them, Who at the first did (of meer nothing) make them. Water, as arm'd with moisture and with cold The cold-dry Earth with her one hand doth hold; The disposing &amp; combining of the Elements. A Similitude.With th'other th'Aire: The Aire, as moist and warm, Holds Fire with one; Water with th'other arm: As Country-Maidens, in the Month of May, Merrily sporting on a Holy-day, And lusty dancing of a huely Round About the May-pole, by the Bag-pipes sound; Hold hand in hand, so that the first is fast (By means of those between) vnto the last. For, sith 'tis so, that the dry Element Not onely yeelds her owne Babes nourishment, But with the milk of her aboundant brests, Doth also feed th'Aires nimble winged guests, And also all th'innumerable Legions Of greedy mouthes that haunt the Briny Regions (So that th'Earth's Mother, or else Nurse of all That run, or flee, or swim, or slide, or crawl) 'Twas meet, it should be it self's Counterpoize, To stand still firm against the roaring noise Of wrackfull Neptune, and the wrathfull blasts Of parching South, and pinching Boreas: Why the Earth is the lowest, &amp; enuironed with the other three Elements, wherof it is the center.'T was meet, her sad-flowe body to digest Farther from Heav'n than any of the rest: Lest, of Heav'ns Course th'Eternall swift Careers, Rushing against her with their whirling Sphears, Should her transport as swift and violent, As ay they do their neighbour Element. And sith on th'other side th'harmonious Course Of Heav'ns bright Torches is th'immortall source Of earthly life: and sith all alterations (Almost) are caus'd by their quick agitations In all the World, God could not place so fit Our Mother Earth, as in the midst of it. For, all the Stars reflect their liuely rayes On Fire and Aire, and Water, diuers wayes; Dispersing, so, their powerfull influence On, in, and through these various Elements: But, on the Earth, they all in one concurr, And all vnite their seuerall force in her; As in a Wheele, which with a long deep rut Simile. His turning passage in the durt doth cut, The distant spoaks neerer and neerer gather, And in the Naue vnite their points together. As the bright Sun shines through the smoothest Glasse, Simile. The turning Planets influence doth passe Without impeachment through the glist'ring Tent Of the tralucing Fiery Element, Th'Aires triple Regions, the transparent Water; But not the firm Base of this faire Theater. And therefore rightly may we call those Trines (Fire, Aire and Water) but Heav'ns Concubines: For, neuer Sun, nor Moon, nor Stars inioy The loue of these, but onely by the way, As passing by: whereas incessantly The lusty Heav'n with Earth doth company; And with a fruitfull seed, which lends All life, With-childes, each-moment, his owne lawfull wife; And with her louely Babes, in form and nature So diuers, decks this beautifull Theater. The Water, lighter then the Earthy Masse, The Water, between the Earth and Aire. Heauier then Aire, betwixt them both hath place; The better so with a moist-colde, to temper Th'ones ouer-driness, th'others hot distemper. But, my sweet Muse, whither so fast away? Leauing the Earth and Sea till the next Book he comes to treat of the Aire. Soft, soft, my Darling: draw not dry To-Day Castalian Springs; defer the Cirque and Seat, The power and praise of Sea and Earth as yet: Do not anticipate the Worlds Beginning; But, till To-Morrow leaue the enter-blinning Of Rocky Mounts, and rouling Waues so wide. For, euen To Morrow will the Lord diuide, With the right hand of his Omnipotence, These yet confus'd and mingled Elements; And liberally the shaggy Earth adorn With Woods, and Buds of fruits, of flowers and corn. 'Tis time, my Loue, 'tis time, mine onely Care, To hie vs hence, and mount vs in the Aire: 'Tist me (or neuer) now my dearest Minion, To imp strong farcels in thy sacred pinion; That lightly born vpon thy Virgin back, Safe through the VVelkin I my course may take: Com, com, my Ioy, lend me thy lilly shoulder; That thereon raised, I may reach the bolder (Before the rest of my deer Country-men, Of better wit, but worse-applied pen.) At that green Laurel, which the niggard Skies So long haue hidden from my longing eies. The Aire distinguished into 3. Regions.Th'Aire (hoste of Mists, the bounding Tennis-ball, That stormy Tempests toss and play withall; Of winged Clouds the wide inconstant House, Th'vnsettled kingdom of swift Æolus, Great VVare-house of the VVindes, whose traffick giues Motion of life to ev'ry thing that liues) Is not throughout all one: our Elder Sages Haue fitly parted it into three Stages. The High.VVhereof, because the Highest still is driv'n VVith violence of the First-mouing Heav'n, From East to West; and, from the West returning, To th'honored Cradle of the rosiall Morning, And also seated next the Fiery vault; It, by the learned, very hot is thought. The Lowe.That, which we touch, with times doth variate, Now hot, now cold, and sometimes temperate; Warm-temp'red showrs it sendeth in the Spring: In Autumn likewise, but more varying: In Winter time, continuall cold and chill: In Summer season, hot and soultry still: For then, the Fields, scorched with flames, reflect The sparkling rayes of thousand Stars aspect; And chiefly Phœbus, to whose arrows bright Our Globy Grandame serues for But and White. The Middle Region of the Aire.But now, because the Middle Region's set Far from the Fiery feelings flagrant heat, And also from the warm reuerberation Which aye the Earth reflects in diuers fashion; That Circle shiuers with eternall colde. Of the causes of Haile.For, into Hail how should the Water molde, Euen when the Summer hath gilt Ceres Gowne, Except those Climes with Ycicles were sowen? So soon as Sol, leauing the gentle Twins, With Cancer or thirst-panting Leo Inns, The mid-most Aire redoubleth all his Frosts; Being desieged by two mighty Hoasts Of Heat, more fierce 'gainst his Cold force then euer, Cals from all quarters his chill troops together, T'incounter them with his vnited Powr, Which then dispersed, hath far greater powr: As Christian Armies, from the Frontiers far, And out of fear of Turks outrageous War, March in disorder, and become (disperts) As many Squadrons as were Souldiers yerst; So that somtimes th'vntrained Multitude With bats and boawes hath beat them and subdu'd: But, if they once perceiue, or vnderstand The Moony Standards of proud Ottoman To be approaching, and the Sulph'ry thunder Where with he brought both Rhodes and Belgrade vnder; They soon vnite, and in a narrow place Intrench themselues; their courage growes apace, Their heart's on fire; and Circumcised Powrs, By their approach, double the strength of ours. 'Tis (doubt-less) this Contrary Circumstance. The effect, therof in the middle Region of the Aire. Antiperistasis (Bear with the word. I hold it not amiss T'adopt sometimes such strangers for our vse, When Reason and Necessity induce: As namely, where our natiue Phrase doth want A Word so force-full and significant) VVhich makes the Fire seem to our sense and reason Hotter in Winter then in Sommer season: Tis it which causeth the cold frozen Scythia Too-often kist by th'husband of Orithya, To bring forth people, whose still hungry brest (Winter or Sommer) can more meat digest Then those lean staruelings which the Sun doth broil Vpon the hot sands of the Libyan soyl: And that our selues, happily seated faire, Whose spongy lungs draw sweet and holesom Aire, Hide in our stomacks a more liuely heat, While bi-front Ianus frosty frowns do threat, Then when bright Phœbus, leauing swarty Chus, Mounts on our Zenith, to reflect on vs. Th'Almighties hand did this Partition form; Why the air was that distinguished in the 3. Regions. To th'end that Mist, Comets, and Winde, and Storm, Deaw, drizling Showrs, Hail, slippery Ice, and Snowe, In the three Regions of the Aire might growe: VVhereof some, pointed th'Earth to fertilize, Others to punish our impieties, Might daily graue in hardest hearts the loue And fear of him, who Raignes in Heav'n aboue. For, as a little end of burning wax, Of exhalations, and whereunto they are approriate, by the Sun and the Regions of the Aire. By th'emptiness, or of it selfe attracts In Cupping-glasses, through the scotched skin Behinde the Poule, superfluous humours thin, Which fuming from the braine did thence descend Vpon the sight, and much the same offend: So the swift Coach-man, whose bright flaming hair Doth euery Day gild either Hemisphear, Two sorts of vapours by his heat exhales From floating Deeps, and from the flowry Dales: Th'one somwhat hot, but heauy, moist, and thick; The other, light, dry, burning, pure, and quick; Which, through the Welkin roaming all the yeare, Make the World diuers to it selfe appear. Of Mist.Now, if a vapour be so thin that it Cannot to Water be transformed fit, And that with Cold-lym'd wings, it houer neer The flowry Mantle of our Mother deer; Our Aire growes dusky; and moist drowsie Mist Vpon the Fields doth for a time persist. Of Deaw and Ice.And if this vapour fair and softly sty, Not to the cold Stage of the middle Sky, But 'boue the Clouds, it turneth (in a trice) In April, Deaw; in Ianuary, Ice. But, if the Vapour brauely can aduenture Vp to th'eternall seat of shivering Winter, The small thin humour by the Cold is prest Into a Cloud; which wanders East and West Vpon the Winde's wings, till in drops of Rain It fall into his Grandames lap again: VVhether som boistrous winde, with stormy puff Ioustling the Clouds with mutuall counter-buff, Do break their brittle sides, and make them shatter In drizling Showres their swift distilling water: Diuers Similes, shewing how the Rain is caused through the incounter of the Clouds, which are the matter of it.As when a wanton heedless Page (perhaps) Rashly together two full glasses claps; Both being broken, suddenly they pour Both their brew'd liquors on the dusty flour. VVhether some milder gale, with sighing breath Shaking their Tent, their tears disseuereth: As after rain another rain doth drop In shady Forests from their shaggy top, When through their green boughs, whiffing Winds do whirl VVith wanton pufs their wauing locks to curl. Or whether th'vpper Clouds moist heaviness Doth with his waight an vnder Cloud oppress, And so one humour doth another crush, Till to the ground their liquid pearles do gush: As the more clusters of ripe grapes we pack In Vintage-time vpon the hurdles back; At's pearced bottom the more fuming liquor Runns in the scummy Fat, and fals the thicker. Whence if procedeth, that sometimes it raineth Frogs.Then, many Heav'n-floods in our Floods do lose-am; Nought's seen but Showres: the Heav'ns sad sable bosom Seems all in tears to melt; and Earths green bed VVith stinking Frogs is somtimes couered: Either, because the floating Cloud doth fold VVithin it selfe both moist, dry, hot, and cold, Whence all things heer are made: or else for that The actiue windes, sweeping this dusty Flat, Somtimes in th'aire som fruitfull dust doo heap: VVhence these new-formed vgly creatures leap: As on the edges of som standing Lake VVhich neighbour Mountains with their gutters make, The foamy slime, it selfe transformeth oft To green half-Tadpoles, playing there aloft, Half-made, half-vnmade; round about the Flood, Half-dead, half-liuing; half a frog, half-mud. Somtimes it happens, that the force of Cold Of Snowe. Freezes the whole Cloud: then we may behold In siluer Flakes a heav'nly Wooll to fall; Then, Fields seem grass-less, Forests leafe-less all, The World's all white; and, through the heaps of Snowe, The highest Stag can scarce his armour showe. Somtimes befals, that, when by secret powr, Of Haile. The Cloud's new-chang'd into a dropping showr, Th'excessiue cold of the mid-Aire (anon) Candies-it all in bels of Icy-stone: Whose violent storms somtimes (alas!) doo proin, Without a knife, our Orchard and our Vine; Reap without sickle, beat down Birds and Cattle, Disgrace our Woods, and make our Roofs to rattle. If Heav'ns bright Torches, from Earth's kidneys, sup Of som Vapours, or exhalations whirling in the Low &amp; Middle Regions of the Aire, &amp; wherof the winds are ingendred. Som somwhat dry and heatfull Vapours vp, Th'ambitious lightning of their nimble Fire Would suddenly neer th'Azure Cirques aspire: But scarce so soon their fuming crest hath raught, Or toucht the Coldness of the middle Vault, And felt what force their mortall Enemy In Garrison keeps there continually; When down again, towards their Dam they bear, Holp by the waight which they haue drawn from her: But in the instant, to their aid arriues Another new heat, which their heart reuiues, Re-arms their hand, and hauing staied their flight, Better resolv'd brings them again to fight. Well fortifi'd then by these fresh supplies, More brauely they renew their enterprize: And one-while th'vpper hand (with honour) getting, Another-while disgracefully retreating, Our lower Aire they tosse in sundry sort, As weak or strong their matter doth comport. This lasts not long; because the heat and cold, Equall in force and fortune, equall bold In these assaults; to end this sudden brall, Th'one stops their mountiong, th'other stayes their fall. So that this vapour, neuer resting stound, Stands neuer still, but makes his motion round, Posteth from Pole to Pole, and flies amain From Spain to India, and from Inde to Spain. But though these blustring spirits seem alwaies blow'n By the same spirit, and of like Vapour grow'n; Yet, from their birth-place, take they diuersly A diuers name and diuers quality. Of the Winds, whereof there are foure, principall, compared to the foure Seasons, the foure Complexions, the foure Elements &amp; the foure Ages of man, and assigned to the foure Corners of the World: And called East, West, North &amp; South.Feeling the fower Windes, that with diuers blast, From the fower corners of the World doo haste; In their effects I find fower Temp'raments, Foure Times, foure Ages, and foure Elements. Th'East-winde, in working, follows properly Fire, Choler, Summer, and soft Infancy: That, which dries vp wilde Affrick with his wing, Resembles Aire, Blood, Youth, and liuely Spring: That, which blowes moistly from the Western stage, Like Water, Phlegme, Winter, and heauy Age: That, which comes shiv'ring from cold Climates solely, Earth, withered Eld, Autumn, and Melancholy. Not, but that Men haue long yer this found-out More then these four Windes, East, West, North, and South: Those that (at Sea) to see both Poles are wont, Vpon their Compass two and thirty count, Though they be infinite, as are the places Whence the Heav'n-fanning Exhalation passes: But wheresoeuer their quick course they bend, As on their Chiefs, all on these Foure depend. Diuers effects of the Windes.One while, with whisking broom they brush and sweep The cloudy Curtains of Heav'ns stages steep: Anon, with hotter sighes they dry the Ground, Late by Electra and her sisters drownd. Anon refresh they, with a temp'rate blowing, The soultry Aier; vnder the Dog-starre glowing: On Trees anon they ripe the Plum and Pear, In cods the Poulse, the Corn within the ear: Anon, from North to South, from East to West VVith ceas less wings they driue a Ship addrest: And somtimes whirling, on an open Hill, The round-flat Runner in a roaring Mill, In flowry motes they grind the purest grain, Which late they ripened on the fruitfull Plain. Diuers effects of hot exhalations.If th'Exhalation hot and oyly proue, And yet (as feeble) giueth place aboue To th'Airy Regions euer-lasting Frost, Incessantly th'apt tinding fume is tost Till it inflame: then like a Squib it falls, Or fire-wingd shaft, or sulph'ry Powder Balls. But if this kinde of Exhalation tour Of Comets. Aboue the walls of Winters icy bowr, 'T inflameth also; and anon becoms A new strange Star, presaging woful dooms: And, for this Fier hath more fewell in't Then had the first, 'tis not so quickly spent: Whether the Heav'ns incessant agitation, Into a Star transforming th'Exhalation, Kindle the same: like as a coal, that winkt On a sticks end (and seemed quite extinct) Tost in the dark with an industrious hand, To light the night, becoms a fier-brand: Or whether th'vpper Fire doo fire the same; As lighted Candles doo th'vnlight inflame. According as the vapour's thick or rare, Of other fiery impressions in the regions of the Aire. Euen or vn-euen, long or large, round or square, Such are the Forms it in the Aire resembles: At sight whereof, th'amazed Vulgar trembles. Heer, in the night appears a flaming Spire; There a fierce Dragon folded all in fire; Heer, a bright Comet; there, a burning Beam; Heer, flying Launces; there, a fiery Stream: Heer seems a horned Goat, enuiron'd round With fiery flakes, about the Aire to bound. There, with long bloudy haire, a Blazing Star Threatens the World with Famin, Plague and War: To Princes, death: to Kingdoms, many crosses: To all Estates, ineuitable Losses: To Heard-men, Rot: to Plough-men, hap-lesse Seasons: To Saylers, Storms: to Cities, ciuill Treasons. But hark: what hear I in the Heav'ns? me thinks A liuely description of thunder and lightning. The VVorlds wall shakes, and his Foundation shrinks: It seems euen now that horrible Persephone, Loosing Meger', Alecto and Tysiphone, VVeary of raigning in black Erebus, Transports her Hell between the Heav'n and vs. 'Tis held, I knowe, that when a Vapour moist How they are engendred. As well from Fresh as from Salt water's hoist In the same instant with hot-Exhalations, In th'Airy Regions secondary stations; The Fiery Fume, besieged with the Croud And keen-cold thicknes of that dampish Cloud, Strengthens his strength; and with redoubled Volleys Of ioyned Heat, on the Cold Leagher sallies. A simile.Like as a Lion, very late exil'd, From's natiue Forrests; spet-at and reuil'd, Mockt, moov'd, and troubled with a thousand toyes, By wanton children, idle girles and boyes; With hideous roaring doth his Prison fill, In's narrow Cloistre ramping wildely, still, Runs to and fro; and furious, lesse doth long For liberty, than to reuenge his wrong: This Fire, desirous to break forth again From's cloudy Ward, cannot it selfe refrain; But, without resting, loud it grones and grumbles, It roules and roares, and round-round-round it rumbles, Till (hauing rent the lower side in sunder) With sulph'ry flash it haue shot-down his thunder: Though, willing to vnite, in these alarms, To's Brothers Forces, his own fainting arms; And th'hottest Circle of the World to gaine, To issue vp-ward, oft it striues in vaine: But, 'tis there fronted with a Trench so large, And such an Hoast, that though it often charge, On this and that side, the Cold Camp about, With his Hot Skirmish; yet still, still the stout Victorious Foe repelleth ev'ry push; So that (despairing) with a furious rush (Forgetting honour) it is fain to fly By the back-door, with blushing infamy. Their effects.Then th'Ocean boyls for fear: the Fish doo deem The Sea too shallow to safe-shelter them: The Earth doth shake; the Shepheard in the field In hollow Rocks himself can hardly shield: Th'affrighted Heav'ns open; and, in the vale Of Acheron, grim Plutoe's self looks pale: Th'Aire flames with Fire: for, the loud-roaring Thunder (Renting the Cloud, that it includes, asunder) Sends forth those Flashes which so blear our sight: Simile.As wakefull Students, in the Winters night Against the steel glauncing with stony knocks, Strike sodain sparks into their Tinder-box. Moreouer, Lightning of a fume is fram'd: Through't selfs hot-drinesse, euermore inflam'd: Admirable effects of lightning.Whose powr (past credit) without razing skin, Can bruiz to powder all our bones within: Can melt the Gold that greedy Mizers hoord In barred Cofers, and not burn the boord: Can break the blade, and neuer singe the sheath: Can scorch an infant in the Womb to death; And neuer blemish, in one sort or other, Flesh, bone, or sinew of th'amazed Mother: Consume the shooes, and neuer hurt the feet: Empty a Cask, and yet not perish it. My younger eyes haue often seen a Dame, To whom the flash of Heav'ns fantastick flame Did else no harm, saue (in a moment's space) With windy Rasor shaue a secret place. Shall I omit a hundred Prodigies Of Crownes and circles about the Sun, Moone and other Planets. Oft seen in forehead of the frowning Skies? Somtimes a Fiery Circle doth appeare, Proceeding from the beautious beams and clear Of Sun and Moon, and other Stars aspect, Down-looking on a thick-round Cloud direct; When, not of force to thrust their rayes through-out-it, In a round Crown they cast them round about-it: Like as (almost) a burning candle, put Simile. Into a Closet with the door close shut; Not able through the boords to send his light, Out at the edges round about shines bright. But, in's declining, when Sols countenance Direct vpon a wat'rish Cloud doth glance (A wat'rish Cloud, which cannot easily Hold any longer her moist Tympany) On the moist Cloud he limns his lightsom front; Of the Rainbow, and how it is made. And with a gawdy Pencill paints vpon't A blew-green-gilt Bowe bended ouer vs: For, th'aduerse Cloud, which first receiueth thus Apollo's raies, the same direct repells On the next Cloud, and with his gold it mells Her various colours: Like as when the Sun At a bay-window peepeth in vpon Simile. A boawl of water, his bright beams aspect With trembling lustre it doth far reflect Against th'high feeling of the lightsom Hall, With stately Fret-work ouer-crusted all. On th'other side, if the Cloud side-long sit, And not beneath, or iustly opposite To Sun and Moon; then either of them forms How it comes to passe that sometimes appear diuers Suns and Moons at once. With strong aspect double or trebble Forms Vpon the same. The Vulgars then affright To see at once three Chariots of the Light; And, in the VVelkin on Nights gloomy Throne, To see at once more shining Moons then one. But, O fond Mortals! wherefore doo yee striue A check to mans Pride in striuing to yeeld reason in Nature of all these accidents. VVith reach of Sense, Gods wonders to retriue? VVhat proud desire (rather, what Furie's drift?) Boldens you god-less, all Gods works to sift? I'le not deny, but that a learned man May yeeld some Reason (if he list to scan) Of all that moues vnder Heav'ns hollow Cope; But, not so sound as can all scruple stop: And though he could, yet should we euermore, Praysing these tools, extoll His fingers more Who works with them, and many-waies doth giue To deadest things (instantly) soules, to liue. True Philosophy for Christians, to apply al to their conscience for amendm?t of life.Me thinks I hear, when I doo hear it thunder, The voice that brings Swains vp, and Cæsars vnder: By that Towr-tearing stroak, I vnderstand Th'vndaunted strength of the Diuine right hand: When I behold the Lightning in the Skies, Me thinks I see th'Almighties glorious Eies: When I perceiue it rain-down timely showrs, Me thinks the Lord his horn of Plenty pours: When from the Clouds excessiue Water spins, Me thinks God weeps for our vnwept-for sins: And when in Heav'n I see the Rain-boaw bent, I hold it for a Pledge and Argument, That neuer more shall Vniuersall Floods Presume to mount ouer the tops of VVoods VVhich hoary Atlas in the Clouds doth hide, Or on the Crowns of Caucasus doo ride: But, aboue all, my pearced soule inclines, VVhen th'angry Heav'ns threat with prodigious Signes; VVhen Natures order doth reuerse and change, Prepost'rously into disorder strange. All the learned in the World cannot out of the schoole of Nature giue reason or many things that are created in the High and Middle Regions of the Aire.Let all the VVits, that euer suckt the breast Of sacred Pallas, in one VVit be prest, And let him tell me (if at least he can By rule of Nature, or meer reach of man) A sound and certain reason of the Cream, The VVooll and Flesh that from the Clouds did stream: Let him declare what cause could erst beget, Amid the Aire, those drizzling showrs of VVheat, VVhich in Carinthia twice were seen to shed; VVhereof that people made them store of Bread. The true cause of these Prodigies. God, the great God of Heav'n, somtimes delights From top to toe to alter Natures Rites; That his strange Works, to Nature contrary, May before-runners of som misery. The drops of Fire which weeping Heav'n did showr Ex?ples drawn out of the History of the Romans, Iewes, Turks &amp; Fr?ch, both Ecclesiasticall &amp; profane.Vpon Lucania, when Rome sent the Flowr Of Italy, into the wealthy Clime VVhich Euphrates fats with his fruitfull slime; Presag'd, that Parthians should, the next year, tame The proud Lucanians, and nigh quench their Name. The clash of Arms, and clang of Trumpets heard High in the Aire, when valiant Romans warr'd Victoriously, on the (now-Canton'd) Suisses, Cymbrians, and Almans, hewing all in pecces; 'Gainst Epicures profane assertions, showe That 'tis not Fortune guides this World belowe. Thou that beheld'st from Heav'n, with triple Flashes, Cursed Olympius smitten all to ashes, For Blasphemies 'gainst th'One Eternall-Three; Dai'st thou yet belch against the Trinitie? Dar'st thou, profane, spet in the face of God, Who for blasphemers hath so sharp a rod? Iewes (no more Iewes, no more of Abr'ham Sons; But Turks, Tartarians, Scythians, Lestrigons) Say what you thought; what thought you, when so long A flaming Sword ouer your Temple hung; But that the Lord would with a mighty arme The righteous vengeance of his wrath performe On you, and yours? that what the Plague did leaue, Th'infatiate gorge of Famine should bereaue? And what the Plague and Famine both did spare, Should be clean gleaned by the hand of War? That sucking Infants, crying for the teat, Self-cruell Mothers should vnkindly eat? And that (yer long) the share and coultar should Rub off their rust vpon your Roofs of gold? And all, because you (cursed) crucifi'd The Lord of life, who for our ransom dy'd. The ruddy Fountain that with blood did flowe: Th'huge Fiery Rock the thundring Heav'ns did throwe Into Liguria: and the bloody Crosses Seen on mens garments, seem'd with open voyces To cry aloud, that the Turk's swarming hoast Should pitch his proud Moons on the Genoan coast. O Frantick France! why dost not Thou make vse Of Strangefull Signes, whereby the Heav'ns induce The Poet seuerely taxeth his Countrimen for not marking, or not making vse of strange and extraordinary tokens of Gods imminent displeasure. Thee to repentance? Canst thou tear-less gaze (Euen night by night) on that prodigious Blaze, That hairy Comet, that long streaming Star, Which threatens Earth with Famine, Plague, and War (Th'Almighty's Trident, and three-forked fire Wherewith he strikes vs in his greatest Ire)? But what (alas!) can Heauens bare threatnings vrge? Sith all the sharp Rods which so hourely scourge Thy sens-less back, cannot so much as wrest One single sigh from thy obdurate brest? Thou drink'st thine own blood, thine own flesh thou eatest, In what most harmes thee thy delight is greatest. O sens-les Folk, sick of a Lethargy, Who to the death despise your Remedy! Like froward Iades that for no striking stur, But wax more restif still the more we spur: The more your wounds, more your secureness growes, Eat with afflictions, as an Asse with blowes: And as the sledge hardens with strokes the steel; So, the more beaten, still the less ye feel. Upon like consideration the Translator sharply citeth England; and to rouze her from her present security proposeth feareful examples of her own troublous changes, and other terrible chastisements.And wanton England, why hast thou forgot Thy visitation, as thou hadst it not? Thou hast seen signes, and thou hast felt the rod Of the revenging wrathfull hand of God. The frowning Heav'ns in fearfull Sightes fore-spoke Thy Roman, Saxon, Dane, and Norman Toak: And since (alas!) vnkinder wounds then those, The Ciuill rents of thy diuided Rose: And, last of all, the raging Wolues of Rome, Tearing thy limbs (Christs Lambs) in Martyrdome. Besides Great Plagues, and grievous Dearths, which (yerst) Haue oft the Sinnews of thy strength reuerst. But thou, more faulty, more forgetfull art Then Boyes that fear but while they feel the smart: All this is past; and Thou, past feare if it, In Peace and Plenty, as a Queen doost sit, Of Rods forgetfull, and for Rest ingratefull (That sottish dulness: this, a sin most hatefull) Ingratefull to thy God, who all hath sent; And thy late Queen, his sacred instrument, By whose pure hand, he hath more blessed Thine, Esay chap. 5. 1. 2. 3. &amp;c.Then yerst his owne Choyce-planted Hebrew Vine: From whence he look't for Grapes (as now from thee); That bore him Crabs: Thou worse (if worse may be): That was destroy'd, the wilde Boar entred in. England beware: Like punishment, like sin. But, O! what boots, or what auailes my song To this deaf Adder, that hath slept so long, Snorting so loud on pillowes of Security, Dread-less of danger, drowned in Impurity; Whose Senses all, all ouer-grow'n with Fat, Haue left no door for Fear to enter at? Yet once again (deer Countrie) must I call: England repent; Fall, to preuent thy Fall. Though thou be blinde, thy wakefull watchmen see Heav'ns Irefull vengeance hanging over thee In fearfull Signes, threatning a thousand Woes To thy Sinn's Deluge, which all over-flowes. Thine vncontrold, bold, open Athëism: Close Idol-seruice: Cloaked Hypocrism: Common Blaspheming of Gods Name, in Oaths: Vsuall Profaning of his Sabbaoths: Thy blind, dumb, Idol-shepheards, choakt with steeples, That fleece thy Flocks, and do not feed thy Peoples: Strife-full Ambition, Florentizing States: Bribes and Affection swaying Magistrates: Wealth's mercy-less Wrong, Vsury, Extortion: Poore's Idleness, repining at their Portion: Thy Drunken Surfets; and Excess in Diet: Thy Sensuall wallowing in Lascivious Riot: Thy huft, puft, painted, curld, purld, Wanton Pride (The Baud to Lust, and to all Sinns beside) These are thy Sinnes: These are the Signes of Ruin, To every State that doth the same pursue-in: Such, cost the Iewes and Asians Desolation, Now turned Turks, that were the Holy Nation. Happy who take by others dangers warning: All that is writ, is written for our learning: So preach thy prophets: But, who heeds their cry: Or who beleeues? Then much less hope haue I. Wherefore (Deer Bartas) hauing warned them; From this Digression, turn we to our Theam. As our All-welcom Soveraign (Englands solace, Simile. Heav'ns care, Earths comfort) in his stately Palace, Hath next His Person, Princes of his Realms Next him in blood, extract from Royall Stems; Next those, the Nobles; next, the Magistrates That serue him truly in their seuerall States; As more more or less their diuers Dignitie Coms neer the Greatness of his Maiestie: So, next the Heav'ns, God marshall'd th'Element Which seconds them in swift bright Ornament: Hauing sufficiently discoursed of the Aire, he begins to handle the Element of Fire. And then the rest, according as of kin To th'Azure Sphears, or th'Erring Fires they bin. Yet som (more crediting their eyes, then Reason) From's proper place this Essence doo disseisin; Against such as deny the Fire to be an Element. And vainely striue (after their Fancies sway) To cut the World's best Element away, The nimble, light, bright-flaming, heatfull Fire, Fountain of life, Smith, Founder, Purifier, Cook, Surgeon, Soldier, Gunner, Alchymist, The source of Motion: briefly, what not is't? Apt for all, acting all; whose arms embrace, Vnder Heav'ns arms, this Vniuersall Mass. For, if (say they) the Fire were lodg'd between Their Reasons. The Heav'ns and vs, it would by night be seen; Sith then, so far-off (as in Meads we pass) We see least Glow-worms glister in the grass: Bosides, how should we through the Fiery Tent, Perceiue the bright eyes of the Firmament? Sith heer the soundest and the sharpest ey Can nothing through our Candle-flames descry. Answers.O! hard-beleeuing Wits! if Zephyrus And Austers sighes were neuer felt of vs, You would suppose the space between Earth's Ball, And Heav'ns bright Arches, void and empty all: And then no more you would the Aire allow For Element, then th'hot-bright Flamer now. Difference between th'Elementary fire &amp; ours.Now ev'n as far as Phœbus light excels The light of Lamps, and every Taper els Wherewith we vse to lengthen th'After-noon Which Capricorn duckes in the Sea too soon; So far in pureness th'Elementall Flame Excels the Fire that for our vse we frame. For, ours is nothing but a dusky light, Grofs, thick, and smoaky, enemy to sight: But, that aboue (for, being neither blent With fumy mixture of gross nourishment, Nor tost with winds, but far from vs) coms neer It's neighbour Heav'n, in nature pure and cleer. Heere for conclusion of this second booke, he commeth to discourse of the Heauens, &amp; first intreateth of their matter &amp; Essence. According to the opinion of the Philosophers.But, of what substance shall I, after-thee (O matchless Master) make Heav'ns Canapey? Vncertain, heer my resolutions rock And waver, like th'inconstant Weather-Cock; Which, on a Towr turning with every blast, Changeth his Master, and his place as fast. Learned Lycæum, now awhile, I walk-in: Then th'Academian sacred Shades I stalk-in. Treading the way that Aristotle went, I doo depriue the heav'ns of Element, And mixture too; and think, th'omnipotence Of God did make them of a Quint-Essence; Sith of the Elements, two still erect Their course.Their motion vp; two euer down direct: But the Heav'ns course, not wandring vp nor down, Continually turns onely roundly round. The Elements haue no eternall race, But settle ay in their assigned place: But th'azure Circle, without taking breath, His certain course for euer gallopeth; It keeps one pase, and mov'd with waight-less waights, It neuer takes fresh horse, nor neuer baits. Things that consist of th'Elements vniting, Are euer tost with an intestin fighting; Heauen not subiect to alteration, as are the Elements.Whence, springs (in time) their life and their deceasing, Their diuers change, their waxing and decreasing: So that, of all that is, or may be seen With mortall eyes, vnder Nights horned Queeen, Nothing retaineth the same form and face, Hardly the half of half an howers space. But, the Heav'ns feel not fates impartiall rigour: Years add not to their stature nor their vigour: Vse wears them not; but their green-ever Age Is all in all still like their Pupillage. Then suddenly, turnd studious Platonist, What vse of Elements in the Heauens. I hold, the Heav'ns of Elements consist: Tis Earth, whose firm parts make their Lamps apparent, Their bodies fast; Aire makes them all transparent: Fire makes their restless circles pure, and cleer, Hot, lightsome, light, and quick in their career: And Water, noynting with cold-moist the brims Of th'enter-kissing turning Globes extreams, Tempers the heat (caus'd by their rapid turning) Which else would set all th'elements a-burning. Not, that I doo compare or match the Matter Difference between the Elements whereof the Heauens are composed, and these inferiour Elements. Whence I compose th'All-compassing Theater, To those gross Elements which heer belowe Our hand and eye doth touch and see and knowe: 'T's all fair, all pure; a sacred harmony Those bodies bindes in end less Vnity: That Aier's not flitting, nor that Water floating, Nor Fire inflaming, nor Earth dully doating: Nor one to other aught offensiue neither, But (to conclude) Celestiall altogether. See, see the rage of humane Arrogance: Detesting the presumption of those curious wits searching these secrets, He limits himselfe, within the bounds of Christian Sobriety. See how far dares man's erring Ignorance, That with vnbridled tongue (as if it oft Had try'd he mettle of that vpper Loft) Dares, without proof or without reason yeelded, Tell of what timber God his Palace builded. But, in these doubts much rather rest had I, Then with mine error draw my Reader wry; Till a Saint Paul doo re-descend from Heav'n, Or till my self (this sinfull roab be reav'n, This rebell Flesh, whose counterpoize oppresses My pilgrim Soule, and euer it depresses) Shall see the beauties of that Blessed Place: If (then) I ought shall see, saue Gods bright Face. But ev'n as many (or more) quarrels cumber Diuers opinions of the number of the Heauens. Th'old Heathen Schools about the Heav'ns number. One holds but one; making the Worlds Eyes shine Through the thin-thickness of that Crystall line (As through the Oceans cleer and liquid Flood The slippery Fishes vp and down doo scud.) Another, iudging certain by his eye, And (seeing Seav'n bright Lamps, moov'd diuersly, Turn this and that way: and, on th'other side, That all the rest of the Heav'ns twinkling pride Keep all one course; ingeniously, he varies The Heav'ns rich building into eight round Stories. Others, amid the Starriest Orbe perceiuing A triple cadence, and withall conceiuing That but one naturall course one body goes, Count nine, some ten, not numbring yet (with those) Th'empyreall Palace, where th'eternall Treasures Of Nectar flowe, where ever-lasting Pleasures Are heaped-vp, where an immortall May In bliss-full beauties flourisheth for ay, Where Life still liues, where God his Assises. Sises holds Enuiron'd round with Seraphins, and Soules Bought with his precious blood, whose glorious Flight Yerst mounted Earth aboue the Heav'ns bright. Nor shall my faint and humble Muse presume So high a Song and Subiect to assume. He stoppeth at the contemplation and praise of the Heauens: Which hee considereth as distinguished into ten stages or Heauens.O fair, fiue-double Round, Sloath's Foe apparent, Life of the World, Dayes, Months, and Years owne Parent; Thine owne selfs modell, never shifting place, And yet thy pure wings with so swift a pase Fly ouer vs, that but our Thought alone Can (as thy babe) pursue thy motion: Infinite finite: free from growth and grief, Discord and death; dance-louer; to be brief, Still like thy self, all thine owne in thee all, Transparent, cleer, light; law of this lowe Ball: Which in thy wide bout, bound-less all doost bound, And claspest all, vnder, or in thy Round; Throne of th'Almighty, I would faine rehearse Thy various Dances in this very Verse, If it were time, and but my bounded Song Doubteth to make this Second-Day too-long. For, notwithstanding, yet another day I fear som Critick will not stick to say, My babbling Muse did fail with euery gale, And mingled yarn to length her web withall. The summe of what hath been handled in this book, &amp; what is to be vnderstood by the firmam?t which Moses discribeth in the first of Gen. 6.But knowe, what e'r thou be, that heer I gather Iustly so many of Gods works together, Because by th'Orbe of th'ample Firmament (Which round This-Day th'Eternal Finger pent Between the lower Waters and the higher) I mean the Heav'ns, the Aire, and th'vpper Fire, Which separate the Oceans waters salt, From those which God pour'd o'r th'Ethereall Vault. Against those that think there are no waters aboue the firmament: Whom he confuseth by diuers Reasons.Yet haue I not so little seen and sought The Volums, which our Age hath chiefest thought, But that I know how suttly greatest Clarks Presume to argue in their learned Works, T' o'r-whelm these Floods, this Crystall to deface, And dry this Ocean, which doth all imbrace. But as the beauty of a modest Dame, Simile. Who, well-content with Natures comly Frame, And natiue Fair (as it is freely giv'n) In fit proportion by the hand of Heav'n) Doth not, with painting, prank, nor set-it out With helps of Art, sufficient Fair without; Is more praise-worthy, then the wanton glance, Th'affected gait, th'alluring countenance, The Mart of Pride, the Periwigs and painting, Whence Courtisans refresh their beauties fainting: So doe I more the sacred Tongue esteem 1. The word of God to be preferred before the voice of man. (Though plaine and rurall it do rather seem, Then schoold Athenian; and Diuinitie, For onely varnish, haue but Verity) Then all the golden Wit-pride of Humanity, Wherewith men burnish their erroneous vanity. I'l rather giue a thousand times thely 2. Gods word mentioneth waters before the firmament. To mine owne Reason, then but once defy The sacred voice of th'ever-lasting Spirit, Which doth so often and so loud averr-it, That God, aboue the shining Firmament, I wot not, I, what kinde of Waters pent: Gen. 1. 7. Psal. 104. 3. Psal. 148. 4. VVhether, that pure, super-celestiall Water, With our inferiour haue no likely nature: VVhether, turnd Vapour, it hath round embow'd Heav'ns highest stage in a transparent Cloud: Or whether (as they say) a Crystall case Do (round about) the Heav'nly Orb embrace. But, with coniectures wherefore striue I thus? Can doubtful proofs the certainty discuss? I see not, why Mans reason should withstand, 3. The power of God ought to be of greater authority than Mans Reason. Or not beleeue, that He whose powrfull hand Bay'd-vp the Red-Sea with a double Wall, That Israels Hoast might scape Egyptian thrall, Could prop as sure so many waues on high Aboue the Heav'ns Star-spangled Canapy. See we not hanging in the Clouds each howr So many Seas, still threatning down to pour, 4. The considerati? of the waters which hang of the Aire, and of the Sea which compasseth the Earth. Supported onely by th'Aire's agitation (Selfly too weak for the least waight's foundation)? See wee not also, that this Sea belowe, Which round about our Earthly Globe doth flowe, Remaines still round; and maugre all the surly Æolian Slaues, and Water's hurly burly, Dares not (to levell her proud liquid Heap) Neuer so little past her limits leap? Why then beleeue we not, that vpper Sphear May (without falling) such an Ocean bear? 5. Diuers effects continuall and admirable in Nature.Vncircumcised! O hard hearts! at least Lett's think that God those Waters doth digest In that steep place: for, if that Nature heer Can form firm Pearl and Crystall shining cleer Of liquid substance; let's beleeue it rather Much more in God (the Heav'ns and Nature's Father) Let vs much more, much more lett's peiz and ponder Th'Almighties Works, and at his Wisedom wonder: Let vs obserue, and boldly-weigh it well, That this proud Palace where we rule and dwell (Though built with match-less Art) had fall'n long since, Had't not been seel'd-round with moist Elements. For, like as (in Man's Little-World) the Brain Doth highest place of all our Frame retain, And tempers with it's moistfull coldness so Th'excessiue heat of other parts belowe: Th'eternall Builder of this Beautious Frame To enter-mingle meetly Frost with Flame, And cool the great heat of the Great-World's Torches, This-Day spred Water over Heav'ns bright Arches. These Seas (say they) leagu'd with the Seas belowe, Hiding the highest of the Mountains tho, Had drown'd the whole World; had not Noah builded Taking occasion by his former discourse, he treateth of the incounter of the vpper waters with the lower: whence followed the generall flood in the daies of Noah: Which here he liuely representeth.A holy Vessell, where his house was shielded: Where, by direction of the King of Kings, He sav'd a seed-pair of all liuing things. No sooner shipt, but instantly the Lord Downe to th'Æolean dungeon him bestirr'd, There muzzled close Cloud-chasing Boreas, And let loose Auster, and his lowring race, Who soon set forward with a dropping wing; Vpon their beard for euery hair a spring, A night of Clouds muffled their brows about, Their wattled locks gusht all in Riuers out; And both their hands, wringing thick Clouds asunder, Send forth fierce lightning, tempest, rain, and thunder. Brooks, Lakes, and Floods, Rivers and foaming Torrents Suddenly swell; and their confused Currents, Losing their old bounds, break a neerer way To run at random with their spoils to Sea. Th'Earth shakes for fear, and (sweating doth consume her, And in her veins leaues not a drop of humour. And thou thy self, O Heav'n, didst set wide ope (Through all the Marches in thy spacious cope) All thy large sluces, thy vast Seas to shed In sudden spouts on thy proud Sisters head; Whose aw-less, law-less, shame-less life abhord, Only delighted to despight the Lord. Th'Earth shrinks and sinks; now th'Ocean hath no shore: Now Rivers run to serue the Sea no more; Themselues are Sea: the many sundry Streams, Of sundry names (deriv'd from sundry Realms) Make now but one great Sea: the World it self Is nothing now but a great standing Gulf, Whose swelling surges strive to mix their Water With th'other Waues about this roued Theater. The Sturgeon, coasting over Castles, muses (Vnder the Sea) to see so many houses. The Indian Manat, and the Mullet float O'r Mountain tops, where yerst the bearded Goat Did bound and brouz: the crooked Dolphin scuds O'r th'highest branches of the hugest Woods. Nought boots the Tigre, or the Hart or Horse, Or Hare, or Grey-hound, their swift speedy course; For, seeking Land, the more they strain and breath them, The more (alas) it shrinks and sinks beneath them. The Otter, Tortoise, and fell Crocodile, VVhich did enioy a double house yer-while, Must be content with only water now. The Wolf and Lamb, Lions and Bucks, do rowe Vpon the Waters, side by side, suspectless. The Glead and Swallow, labouring long (effect-less) 'Gainst certain death, with wearied wings fall down (For want of Pearch) and with the rest do drown. And, for mankinde, imagine som get vp To som high Mountains over-hanging top; Som to a Towr, some to a Cedar tree, Whence round about a World of deaths they see: But wheresoever their pale fears aspire For hope of safety, th'Ocean surgeth higher; And still-still mounting as they still do mount, When they cease mounting, doth them soon surmount. One therefore ventures on a Plank to rowe, One in a Chest, another in a Trough: Another, yet half-sleeping, scarce perceives How's bed and breath, the Flood at once bereaves; Another, labouring with his feet and hands, Awhile the fury of the Flood withstands (Which by his side hath newly droun'd his Mother, His Wife, his Son, his Sister, Sire, and Brother): But, tyr'd and spent, weary and wanting strength, He needs must yeeld (too) to the Seas at length; All, all must die then: but Parcæ, à non parcendo: the none-sparing Fates, that is to say, Death. th'impartiall Maids, Who wont to vse so sundry tools for aids, In execution of their fatall slaughters, Had only now the furious foaming Waters. Safely, the while, the sacred Ship did float On the proud shoulders of that boundless-Moat, Though mast-less, oar-less, and from Harbour far; For God was both her Steers-man and her Star. Thrice fifty dayes that Vniuersall Flood Wasted the World; which then the Lord thought good To re-erect, in his Compassion great. No sooner sounds he to the Seas retrait, But instantly waue into waue did sink With sudden speed, all Riuers gan to shrink; Th'Ocean retires him to his wonted prison; The Woods are seen; the Mountain tops are risen Out of their slimy Bed: the Fields increase And spread apace; so fast the waters cease. And (briefly th'only thundring hand of God Now Earth to Heav'n, Heav'n vnto Earth re-show'd; That he again Panchaian Fumes might see Sacred on Altars to his Maiesty. He concludeth with a most godly prayer accommodated to the state of the Church in our time.Lord, sith 't hath pleas'd thee likewise, in our Age, To saue thy Ship from Tyrants stormy rage, Increase in Number (Lord) thy little Flock; But more in Faith, to build on thee, the Rock. So Morne and Euen the second Day conclude, And God perceiu'd that all his works were good. THE THIRD DAY OF THE FIRST WEEK. The Argvment. The Sea, and Earth: their various Equipage: Seuer'd a-part: Bounds of the Oceans rage: 'T imbraceth Earth: it doth all Waters owe: Why it is salt: How it doth Ebb, and Flowe: Rare streames, and fountains of strange operation: Earth's firmness, greatness, goodness: sharp taxation Of Bribes, Ambition, Treason, Auarice: Trees, Shrubs, and Plants: Mines, Metalls, Gemms of price: Right vse of Gold: the Load-stones rare effects: The Countrey-life preferr'd in all respects. My sacred Muse, that lately soared high Fr? the Heauen and Regions of the Aire, the Poet descendeth to the Earth and Sea. Among the glist'ring Circles of the Sky (Whose various dance, which the first Moover driues Harmoniously, this Vniverse revives) Commanding all the Windes and sulph'ry Storms, The lightning Flashes, and the hideous Forms Seen in the Aire; with language meetly braue Whilom discourst vpon a Theam so graue: But, This-Day, flagging lowely by the Ground, She seems constrain'd to keep a lowely sound; Or, if somtimes, she somwhat raise her voyce, The sound is drown'd with the rough Oceans noyse. O King of grassie and of glassie Plains, He calleth vpon the true God to be assisted in the description of these two Elements, and the things therein. Whose powrfull breath (at thy drad will) constrains The deep Foundations of the Hils to shake, And Seas falt billowes 'gainst Heav'ns vaults to rake: Grant me, To-Day, with skilfull Instruments To bound aright these two rich Elements: In learned Numbers teach me sing the natures Of the firm Earth, and of the floating Waters; And with a flowring stile the Flowrs to limn Whose Colours now shall paint the Fields so trim. God in this 3. Day, gathers together the Waters, &amp; separates them from the Earth.All those steep Mountaines, whose high horned tops The misty cloak of wandring Clouds enwraps, Vnder First Waters their crump shoulders hid, And all the Earth as a dull Pond abid, Vntill th'All-Monarch's bountious Maiesty (Willing t'enfe of man this worlds Empety) Commanding Neptune straight to marshall forth His Floods a-part, and to vnfold the Earth; And, in his Waters, now contented rest, T'haue all the World, for one whole day, possest. By an apt c?parison, he sheweth how the Water withdrew from off the Earth.As when the muffled Heav'ns haue wept amain, And foaming streames assembling on the Plain, Turn'd Fields to Floods; soon as the showrs do cease, With vnseen speed the Deluge doth decrease, Sups vp it selfe, in hollow sponges sinks, And's ample arms in straighter Chanell shrinks: Even so the Sea, to 't selfe it selfe betook, Mount after Mount, Field after Field forsook; And suddenly in smaller caskdd tun Her Waters, that from euery side did run: Whether th'imperfect Light did first exhale Much of that primer Humor, wherewithall God, on the Second-Day, might frame and found The Crystall Sphears that he hath spred so round: Whether th'Almighty did new place prouide To lodge the Waters: whether op'ning wide Th'Earth's hollow Pores, it pleas'd him to conueigh Of the ledging and bed of the Sea.Deep vnder ground some Arms of such a Sea: Or whether, pressing waters gloomy Globe; That cov'rd all (as with a cloudy Robe) He them impris'ned in those bounds of brass, Which (to this day) the Ocean dares not pass Whithout his licence. For, th'Eternall, knowing The Seas commotiue and inconstant flowing, The Sea kept within her bound by the Almighty power of God.Thus curbed her; and 'gainst her enuious rage, For ever fenc't our Flowry-mantled Stage: So that we often see those rowling Hils, With roaring noise threatning the neighbour Fields, Through their own spite to split vpon the shore, Foaming for fury that they dare no more. For, what could not that great, high Admirall Work in the Waues, sith at his Seruants call, His dreadfull voyce (to saue his ancient Sheep) Did cleaue the bottom of th'Erithræn Deep? And toward the Crystall of his double source Exod. 14. 11 Iosuah. 3.16 Gen 7. 21 Exod. 17. 6. Compelled Iordan to retreat his course? Drown'd with a Deluge the rebellious World? And from dry Rocks abundant Rivers purl'd? Lo, thus the waighty Water did yer-while With winding turns make all this world an Ile. For, like as molten Lead being poured forth Vpon a leuell plot of sand or earth, In many fashions mazeth to and fro; A fit Simile shewing the winding turns of the Sea aboue the Earth. Runs heer direct, there crookedly doth go, Heer doth diuide it self, there meets againe; And the hot Riv'let of the liquid vain, On the smooth table crawling like a worm, Almost (in th'instant) euery form doth form: God pour'd the Waters on the fruitfull Ground In sundry figures; som in fashion round, Som square, som crosse, som long, som lozenge-wise, Som triangles, som large, som lesser size; Amid the Floods (by this faire difference) To giue the world more wealth and excellence. Such is the German Sea, such Persian Sine, Such th'Indian Gulf, and such th'Arabian Brine, And such Our Sea: whose divers-brancht Windings. retortions, Divide the World in three vnequall Portions. And, though each of these Arms (how large soeuer) To the great Ocean seems a little Riuer: The arms of the Sea distinguished into smaller members with commodities &amp; vse thereof. Each makes a hundred sundry Seas besides (Not sundry in waters, but in Names and Tides) To moisten kindely, by their secret Vains, The thirsty thickness of the neighbour Plains: To bulwark Nations, and to serue for fences Against th'invasion of Ambitious Princes: To bound large Kingdomes with eternall limits: To further Traffick through all Earthly Climates: T'abbridge long Iourneys; and with ayd of Winde Within a month to visit either Inde. But, th'Earth not only th'Oceans debter is A Catalogue of most of the most famous Riuers in the World. For these large Seas; but owes him Tanäis, Nile (Agypts treasure) and his neighbour stream That in the Desart (through his haste extream) Loseth himselfe so oft; swift Euphrates; And th'other proud Son of cold Niphates: Fair spacious Ganges, and his famous brother, That lends his name vnto their noble Mother: Gold-sanded Tagus, Rhyne, Rhone, Volga, Tiber, Danubius, Albis, Po, Sein, Arne, and Iber; The Darian Plate, and Amazonian River (Where Spain's Gold-thirsty Locusts cool their liver): Our siluer Medway (which doth deepe indent The Flowrie Medowes of My natiue Kent; Still sadly vveeping (vnder Pensherst vvalls) Th'Arcadian Cygnet's bleeding Funerals) Our Thames and Tweed, our Severn, Trent, and Humber, And many moe, too infinite to number. Of him, she also holds her Siluer Springs, And all her hidden Crystall Riverlings: Fountains Springs and Riuers welling out of the Earth.And after (greatly) in two sorts repaies Th'Humour she borrows by two sundry waies. For, like as in a Limbeck, th'heat of Fire Raiseth a Vapour, which still mounting higher To the Still's top; when th'odoriferous sweat Above that Miter can no further get, A Similie shewing how the waters of the Earth are exhaled by the Sun, &amp; then poured into the Sea.It softly thickning, falleth drop by drop, And Cleer as Crystall, in the glass doth hop; The purest humor in the Sea, the Sun Exhales in th'Aire: which there resolv'd, anon, Returns to water; and descends again By sundry waies vn o his Mother Main. For, the dry Earth, having these waters (first) Through the wide five of her void entrails searst; Giving more room, at length from Rockie Mountains How the Fountaines come to breake forth of the Earth.She (night and day) pours forth a thousand Fountains: These Fountains make fresh Brooks with murmuring currents; These murmuring Brooks, the swift and violent Torrents; These violent Torrents, mighty Rivers; These, These Riuers make the vast, deep, dreadfull Seas. The increasing of Brooks and Riuers, and of their falling into the Sea.And all the highest Heav'n-approaching Rocks Contribute hither with their snowie locks: For, soon as Titan, having run his Ring, To th'ycie climates bringeth back the Spring; On their rough backs he melts the hoary heaps, Their tops grow green; and down the water leaps On every side, it foames, it roares, it rushes, And through the steep and stony hills it gushes, Making a thousand brooks; whereof, when one Perceiues his fellow striving to be gone; Hasting his course, he him accompanies; After, another and another hies, All in one race; ioynt-losing all of them Their Names and Waters in a greater stream: And He that robs them, shortly doth deliuer Himselfe and his into a large Riuer And That, at length, how euer great and large (Lord of the Plain) doth in some Gulf discharge His parent-Tribute to Oceanus, According to th'Eternall Rendez-vous. Yet, notwithstanding, all these Streams that enter Why the sea receiueth no increase of all the Waters that fall therein. In the Main Sea, do nought at all augment her: For that, besides that all these Floods in one, Matcht with great Neptune, seem as much as none; The Sun (as yerst I said) and Windes withall, Sweeping the sur-face of the Brinie-Ball, Extract as much still of her humours thin, As weeping Aire and welling Earth pours in. But as the swelting heat, and shivering cold, Gnashing and sweat, that th'Ague-sick do hold, Come not at hazzard, but in time and order Afflict the body with their fell disorder: The Sea hath fits, alternate course she keepes, Of the Ebbing and Flowing of the Sea: &amp; sundry causes therof. From Deep to Shoar, and from the Shoar to Deeps. VVhether it were, that at the first, the Ocean From Gods owne hand receiu'd this double Motion, By means whereof, it never resteth stound, But (as a turning Whirli-gig goes round, VVhirls of it self, and good-while after takes Simile. Strength of the strength which the first motion makes: VVhither the Sea, which we Atlantick call, Be but a peece of the Grand Sea of all; And that his Floods entring the ample Bed Of the deep Main (with fury hurried Against the Rocks) repulsed with disdain, Be thence compelled to turn back again: Or whether Cynthia, that with Changefull laws Commands moist bodies, doth this motion cause: As on our Shoar, we see the Sea to rise Soon as the Moon begins to mount our skies. Proofe of the third cause: viz. that the waxing and waning the Moon, causeth the flowing and ebbing of the Sea. And when, through Heav'ns Vault vailing toward Spain, The Moone descendeth, then it Ebbs again. Again, so soon as her inconstant Crown Begins to shine on th'other Horison, It Flowes again: and then again it falls When she doth light th'other Meridionalls. VVee see more-ouer, that th'Atlantik Seas Doo Flowe far farther then the Genöese, Or both the Bosphores; and that Lakes, which growe Out of the Sea, do neither Ebb nor Flowe: Because (they say) the siluer fronted Star, That swells and shrinks the Seas (as pleaseth her) Pours with less pow'r her plentious influence Vpon these straight and narrow streamed Fennes, And In-land Seas, which many a Mount immounds, Then on an Ocean vast and void of bounds: Euen as in Sommer, her great brothers Ey, When winds be silent, doth more eas'ly dry Wide spreading Plains, open and spacious Fields, Then narrow Vales vaulted about with Hills. Why the tide is not so well perceiued at sea as by the shoare.If we perceiue not in the Deep, so well As by the shoar, when it doth shrink and swell; Our sprightfull Pulse the Tide doth well resemble, Whose out-side seems more then the midst to tremble. Nor is the glorious Prince of Stars less mighty Then his pale Sister, on vast Amphitrite. The cause of the saltnes of the sea.For Phœbus, boyling with his lightsom Heat The Fish-full Waves of Neptunes Royall Seat, And supping vp still (with his thirsty Rayes) All the fresh humour in the floting Seas, In Thetis large Cells leaveth nought behind, Saue liquid Salt, and a thick bitter Brine. But see (the while) see how the Sea (I pray) Through thousand Seas hath caried me away, In feare t'haue drown'd my selfe and Readers so, The Floods so made my words to over-flowe. Therfore a-shore; and on the tender Lee Of waters separated from the Sea.Of Lakes, and Pools, Rivers, and Springs, let's see The soverain vertues of their severall Waters, Their strange effects, and admirable natures, That with incredible rare force of theirs, Confound our wits, ravish our eyes and ears. Wonderfull effects of diuers Fountains.Th'Hammonian Fount, while Phœbus Torch is light, Is cold as Ice; and (opposite) all night (Though the cold Crescent shine thereon) is hot, And boiles and bubbles like a seething Pot. They say (forsooth) the Riuer Silarus, And such another, call'd Eurimenus, Convert the boughs, the barke, the leaues and all, To very stone, that in their Waters fall. O! should I blanch the Iewes religious River, Which every Sabbath dries his Chanell over; Keeping his Waues from working on that Day Which God ordain'd a sacred Rest for ay? If neere vnto the Eleusinian Spring, Som sport-full Iigsom wanton Shepheard sing, The Ravisht Fountaine falls to daunce and bound, Keeping true Cadence to his rustick sound. Cerona, Xanth, and Cephisus, doe make The thirsty-Flocks that of their Waters take, Black, red, and white. And neer the crimsin Deep, Th'Arabian Fountain maketh crimsin Sheep. Salonian Fountain, and thou Andrian Spring, Out of what Cellars do you daily bring The Oyl and Wine that you abound with, so? O Earth! do these within thine entrails grow? What? be there Vines and Orchards vnder ground? Is Bacchus Trade and Pallas Art there found? What should I, of th'Illyrian Fountain, tell? What shall I say of the Dodónean VVell? Whereof, the first sets any cloathes on-fire; Th'other doth quench (Who but will this admire?) A burning Torch; and when the same is quenched, Lights it again, if it again be drenched. Sure, in the Legend of absurdest Fables I should enroule most of these admirables; Saue for the reuerence of th'vnstained credit Of many a witnes where I yerst haue read it: And sauing that our gain-spurr'd Pilots finde, In our dayes, Waters of more wondrous kind. Of all the Sources infinite to count, Which to an ample Volume would amount, A continuation of the admirable effects of certain Waters. Far hence on Forrain vnfrequented Coast, I'l onely chuse som fiue or six at most, Strange to report, perhaps beleev'd of few; And yet no more incredible then true. In th'Ile of Iron (one of those same Seav'n Whereto our Elders Insulafortunate. Happy name had giv'n) The Savage people neuer drink the streams Of Wells and Riuers (as in other Realms) Their drink is in the Aire; their gushing spring A weeping Tree out of it selfe doth wring: A Tree, whose tender-bearded Root being spred In dryest sand, his sweating Leafe doth shed A most sweet liquor; and (like as the Vine Vntimely cut, weeps (at her wound) her wine, In pearled tears) incessantly distills A Crystall stream, which all their Cisterns fills, Through all the Iland: for, all hither hy; And all their vessels cannot draw it dry. In frosty Islands are two Fountains strange: Th'one flowes with Wax: the other stream doth change All into Iron; yet with scalding steam In thousand bubbles belcheth vp her stream. In golden Peru, neere Saint Helens Mount A stream of Pitch coms from a springing Fount. What more remaines? That New-found World, besides, Toward the West many a faire River guides; Whose floating VVaters (knowing th'vse aright Of VVork-fit Day, and Rest-ordained Night, Better then men) run swiftly, all the Day; But rest, all Night, and stir not any way. Great Enginer, Almighty Architect, I fear, of Enuy I should be suspect, O Baths and Measurable Waters.Enuy of thy Renown and sacred glory, If my ingratefull Rimes should blanch the Story Of Streams, distilling through the Sulphur-Mines, Through Bitumen, Allom, and Nitre veins; VVhich (perfect Leaches) with their vertues cure A thousand Griefs we mortals heere endure, Old in the April of our age therewith, VVhose rigour striues to ante-date our death. Of the excellent Bathes in Gascony.Now, as my happy Gascony excells, In Corne, VVine, VVarriours, every Country els; So doth she also in free Bathes abound; VVhere strangers flock from every part around. The barren womb, the Palsie-shaken wight, Th'vlcerous, gowtie, deaf, and decrepit, From East and VVest arriving, fetch from hence Their ready help with small or no expence. VVitnes Ancossa, Caud'rets, Aiguescald, Barege, Baigners; Baigners, the pride of all, The pride, the praise, the onely Paradise Of all those Mountaines mounting to the skies, VVhere yerst the Gaulian Hercules begot (VVanton Alomena's Bastard, meane I not) On faire Pirene (as the fame doth go) The famous Father of the Gascons; who By noble deeds do worthily averr Their true descent from such an Ancester. On th'one side, Hils hoar'd with eternall Snowes, And craggy Rocks Baigneres doe inclose: The other side is sweetly compast-in With fragrant skirts of an immortall Green, Whose smiling beauties far excell, in all, The famous praise of the Peneïan Vale: There's not a House, but seemeth to be new; Th'even-slated Roofs reflect with glistring blew. To keep the Pavement ever cleane and sweet, A Crystall River runs through every Street, Whose Silver stream, as cold as Ice, doth slide But little off the Physick Waters side; Yet keeps his nature, and disdaines, a iot To intermix his cold with th'others hot. But all these Wonders, that adorn my Verse, Yet come not neer vnto the wondrous Lers. If it be true, that the Stagyrtan Sage (With shame confu'd, and driv'n with desperate rage) Because his Reason could not reach the knowing Of Euripus his seav'n-fold Ebbing-flowing, Leapt in the same, and there his life did end, Compriz'd in that he could not comprehend; What had he done, had he beheld the Fountain, Of the most wonderfull Fountaine of Belestat. Which springs at B'lestat, neere the famous Mountain Of Foix; whose floods bathing Maserian Plains, Furnish with wood the wealthy Tholousains? As oft as Phœbus (in a compleat Race) On both th'Horizons shewes his radiant Face, This wondrous Brook (for foure whole months) doth Flowe, Foure-times-six-times, and Ebbes as oft as lowe. For halfe an houre may dry-shod passe that list: The next halfe hour, may none his course resist. VVhose foaming streame striues proudly to compare (Even in the birth) with Fame-full'st Floods that are O learned (Nature-taught) Arithmetician! Clock-less so iust to measure Time's partition. And little Lambes-Bovrn, though thou match not Lers, Nor hadst the Honor of DuBartas Verse; If mine haue any, Thou must needs partake, Both for thine Owne, and for thine Owners sake; Whose kind Excesses Thee so neerely touch, That Yeerely for them Thou doost weepe so much, All Summer-long (while all thy Sisters shrinke) That of thy teares a million daily drinke; Besides thy Waast, vvhich then in haste doth run To vvash the feet of Chavcer's Donnington: But (vvhile the rest are full vnto the top) All VVinter-long, Thou never show'st a drop, Nor send'st a doit of need-less Subsidie, To Cramm the Kennet's Want-less Treasurie, Before her Store be spent, and Springs be staid: Then, then alone Thou lendst a liberall Aid; Teaching thy vvealthy Neighbours (Mine, of late) How, When and Where to right-participate Their streams of Comfort, to the poore that pine, And not to greaz still the too-greazy Swine: Neither for fame, nor for me (vvhen others doo) To giue a Morsel, or a Mite or two; But seuerally, and of a selfly motion, When others miss, to giue the most devotion. Most wisely did th'eternall All-Creator Dispose these Elements of Earth and VVater: The intermedling of the Earth and Sea, and of the commodities thence arising, &amp; contrariwise of the confusion that would follow, if they were separated. For, sith th'one could not without drink subsist, Nor th'other without stay, bottom and list, God intermixt them so, that th'Earth her brest Op'ning to th'Ocean, th'Ocean winding prest About the Earth, a-thwart, and vnder it: For, the VVorld's Center, both together fit. For, if their mixt Globe held not certainly Iust the iust midst of the VVorlds Axle-tree, All Climats then should not be serv'd aright VVith equall Counterpoiz of day and night: The Horizons il-leuell'd circle wide, VVould sag too-much on th'one or th'other side: Th'Antipodes, or we, at once should take View of more Signes then halfe the Zodiack: The Moon's Eclipses would not then be certain, And setled Seasons would be then vncertaine. The Masse of the Earth and Water together make a perfect Globe.This also serueth for probation sound, That th'Earth and VVaters mingled Mass is Round, Round as a Ball; seeing on euery side The Day and Night successiuely to slide. Yea, though Vespasio (famous Florentine) Marke Pole, and Columb, braue Italian Trine, Our (Spain's Dread) Drake, Candish, and Cumberland, Most valiant Earle, most worthy High Command, And thousand gallant modern Typheis else, Had neuer brought the North-Poles Parallels Vnder the South; and, sayling still about, So many New-vvorlds vnder vs found out. Nay, neuer could they th'Articke Pole haue lost, Nor found th'Antarticke, if in euery Coast Seas liquid Glass round-bow'd not euery where, With sister Earth, to make a perfect Sphear. How it commeth to passe that the Sea is not flat nor leuel; but rising round and bowed about the Earth.But, perfect Artist, with what Arches strong, Props, staies, and Pillars, hast thou stay'd so long This hanging, thin, sad, slippery Water-Ball, From falling out, and ouer-whelming all? May it not be (good Lord) because the Water To the Worlds Center tendeth still by nature; And toward the bottom of this bottom bound, VVilling to fall, doth yet remain still round? Or may't not be, because the surly Banks Keep VVaters captiue in their hollow flanks? Or that our Seas be buttrest (as it were) VVith thousand Rocks dispersed heere and there? Or rather, Lord, is't not Thine onely Powr That Bows it round about Earth's branchy Bowr? The second part of this 3. Booke intreating of the Elem?t of earth and first of the firmnes thereof.Doubtless (great God) 'tis doubtless thine owne hand VVhereon this Mansion-of Mankind doth stand. For, though it hang in th'Aire, swim in the Water, Though euery way it be a round Theater, Though All turn round about it, though for ay It selfes Fundations with swift Motions play, It rests vn-mooueable: that th'Holy Race Of Adam there may find fit dwelling place. Earth is the Mother, Nurse, and Hostesse of mankind.The Earth receiues man when he first is born: Th'Earth nurses him; and when he is forlorn Of th'other Elements, and Nature loaths-him, Th'Earth in her bosom with kind buriall cloaths-him. Oft hath the Aire with Tempests set-vpon-vs, Oft hath the Water with her Floods vndon-vs, Oft hath the Fire (th'vpper as well as ours) With wofull flames consum'd our Towns and Towrs: Onely the Earth, of all the Elements, Vnto Mankind is kind without offence: Onely the Earth did neuer iot displace From the first seat assign'd it by thy grace. Yet true it is (good Lord) that mov'd somtimes Of Earthquakes and of the opening of the earth. With wicked Peoples execrable crimes, The wrathfull power of thy right hand doth make, Not all the Earth, but part of it to quake, With ayd of Windes: which (as imprisoned deep) In her vast entrails, furious murmurs keep. Fear chils our hears (what hart can fear dissemble?) When steeples stagger, and huge Mountains tremble With wind-les wind, and yawning Hell deuours Somtimes whole Cities with their shining Towrs. Sith then, the Earth's, and Water's blended Ball The Globe of the Earth &amp; Sea, is but as a little point, in comparis? of the great circumference of Heauen:. Is center, heart, and nauel of this All; And sith (in reason) that which is included, Must needs be less then that which doth include it; 'Tis question-less, the Orb of Earth and Water Is the least Orb in all the All-Theater. Let any iudge, whether this lower Ball (Whose endles greatness we admire so, all) Seem not a point, compar'd with th'vpper Sphear Whose turning turns the rest in their Career; Sith by the Doctrins of Astronomers, the least Starre in the Firmament is 18 times bigger then all the earth. Sith the least Star that we perceiue to shine Aboue, disperst in th'Arches crystalline (If, at the least, Star-Clarks be credit worth) Is eighteene times bigger then all the Earth: Whence, if we but subtract what is possest (From North to South, &amp; from the East to West) Vnder the Empire of the Ocean Atlantike, Indian, and American; And thousand huge Arms issuing out of these, With infinites of other Lakes and Seas: And also what the two intemperate Zones Doo make vnfit for habitations; VVhat will remaine? Ah! nothing (in respect): Lo heer, O men! Lo wherefore you neglect Heav'ns glorious Kingdom: Lo the largest scope By consideration wherof the Poet taketh occasion to censure sharply the Ambiti?, Bribery, Vsury,. Glory can giue to your ambitious hope. O Princes (subiects vnto pride and pleasure) VVho (to enlarge, but a hair's breadth, the measure Extortion, Deceipt, and generall Couetousnes of Mankind.Of your Dominions) breaking Oaths of Peace, Couer the Fields with bloudy Carcases: O Magistrates, who (to content the Great) Make sale of Iustice, on your sacred Seat; And, broaking Laws for Bribes, profane your Place, To leaue a Leek to your vnthankfull Race: You strict Extorters, that the Poor oppress, And wrong the Widdow and the Father-less, To leaue your Off-spring rich (of others good) In Houses built of Rapine and of Blood: You Citty-Vipers, that (incestuous) ioyn Vse vpon vse, begetting Coyn of Coyn: You marchant Mercers, and Monopolites, Gain-greedy Chap-men; periur'd Hypocrites, Dissembling Broakers, made of all deceipts, Who falsifie your Measures and your Weights, 'T inrich your selues, and your vnthrifty Sons To Gentilize with proud possessions: You that for gaine betray your gracious Prince, Your natiue Country, or your deerest Friends: You that to get you but an inch of ground, With cursed hands remoue your Neighbours bound (The ancient bounds your Ancestors haue set) What gain you all? alas! what do you get? Yea, though a King by wile or war had won All the round Earth to his subiection; Lo heer the Guerdon of his glorious pains: A needles point, a Mote, a Mite, he gains, A Nit, a Nothing (did he All possess); Or if then nothing any thing be less. God hauing discouered the earth, commaunds it to bring forth euery green thing, hearbs, trees, flowers and fruits.VVhen God, whose words more in a moment can, Then in an Age the proudest strength of Man, Had seuered the Floods, leuell'd the Fields, Embas't the Valleys, and embost the Hils; Change, change (quoth hee) O fair and firmest Globe, Thy mourning weed, to a green gallant Robe; Cheer thy sad brows, and stately garnish them, VVith a rich, fragrant, flowry Diadem; Lay forth thy locks, and paint thee (Lady-like) VVith freshest colours on thy sallow cheek. And let from hence-forth thy aboundant brests Not only Nurse thine own Wombs natiue guests, But frankly furnish with fit nourishments The future folk of th'other Elements; That Aire, and water, and the Angels Court, Of Trees growing in Mountains and in Valleys.May all seem iealous of thy praise and port. No sooner spoken, but the lofty Pine Distilling-pitch, the Larch yeeld-Turpentine, Th'euer-green Box, and gummy Cedar sprout, And th'Airy Mountaines mantle round about: The Mast-full Oke, the vse-full Ash, the Holm, Coat changing Cork, white Maple, shady Elm, Through Hill and Plain ranged their plumed Ranks. The winding Riuers bordered all their banks With slice-Sea Aldars, and green Osiars smal, With trembling Poplars, and with Willows pale, And many Trees beside, fit to be made Fewell, or Timber, or to serue for Shade. The dainty Apricock (of Plums the Prince) Of fruit-trees. The veluet Peach, gilt Orenge, downy Quince, All-ready beare grav'n in their tender barks, Gods powerfull prouidence in open marks. The sent-sweet Apple, and astringent Pear, The Cherry Filberd, Wal-nut, Meddeler, The milky Fig, the Damson black and white, The Date, and Olyue, ayding appetite, Spread euery-where a most delightfull Spring, And euery-where a very Eden bring. Heere, the fine Pepper, as in clusters hung: Of shrubs. There Cinamon and other Spices sprung. Heer, dangled Nutmegs, that for thrifty pains Yearly repay the Bandans wondrous gains; There growes (th'Hesperian Plant) the precious Reed Whence Sugar sirrops in aboundance bleed; There weeps the Balm, and famous Trees from whence Th'Arabians fetcht perfuming Frankinsence. There, th'amorous Vine coll's in a thousand sorts Of the Vines, and the excellent vse of Wine temperately taken. (With winding arms) her Spouse that her supports: The Vine, as far inferiour to the rest In beauty, as in bounty past the best: Whose sacred liquor, temperately taen, Reviues the spirits and purifies the brain, Cheers the sad heart, increaseth kindly heat, Purgeth gross blood, and doth the pure beget, Strengthens the stomack, and the colour mends, Sharpens the wit, and doth the bladder cleanse, Opens obstructions, excrements expels, And easeth vs of many Languors els. And though through Sin (wherby from Heav'nly state He preuenteth an obiection, &amp; sheweth that not withstanding mans fall, the, Earth yeeldeth vs matter inough to praise and magnifie her Maker: Simile. Our Parents barr'd vs) th'Earth degenerate From her first beauty, bearing still vpon her Eternall Scars of her fond Lords dishonour: Though with the Worlds age, her weakage decay, Though she becom less fruitfull every day (Much like a Woman with oft teeming worn; Who, with the Babes of her owne body born, Having almost stor'd a whole Towne with people, At length becomes barren, and faint, and feeble) Yet doth shee yeeld matter enough to sing And praise the Maker of so rich a Thing. Neuer mine eies in pleasant Springs behold The azure Flax, the gilden Marigold, Of Flowers.The Violet's purple, the sweet Rose's stammell, The Lillie's snowe, and Pansey's various ammell, But that (in them) the Painter I admire, Who in more Colours doth the Fields attire, Then fresh Aurora's rosie cheeks display, When in the East she Vshers a fair Day: Or Iris Bowe, which bended in the Sky Boades fruitfull deaws when as the Fields be dry, An addition by the Translator, of the rare Sun-louing Lotos.Heer (deer S. Bartas) giue thy Seruant leaue In thy rich Garland one rare Flower to vveaue, Whose vvondrous nature had more vvorthy been Of thy diuine, immortalizing Pen: But, from thy sight, vvhen Sein did swell vvith Bloud, It sunk (perhaps) vnder the Crimsin Flood. (When Beldam Medices, Valois, and Guise, Stain'd Hymens Roab vvith Heathen cruelties) Because the Sun, to shun so vile a view, His Chamber kept; and vvept vvith Bartholmew. For so, so soon as in the Western Seas Apollo sinks, in siluer Euphrates The Lotos diues, deeper and deeper ay Till mid-night: then, remounteth toward Day: But not aboue the Water, till the Sun Doo re-ascend aboue the Horizon. So euer-true to Titans radiant Flame, Semper eadem.That (Rise he, Fall hee) it is Still the same. A Real Emblem of her Royall Honour That vvorthily did take that Word vpon-her; Sacred Eliza, that ensu'd no less Th'eternall Sun of Peace and Righteousnes; Whose liuely lamp (vvhat euer did betide her) In either Fortune vvas her onely Guider. For, in her Fathers and her Brothers Daies, Fair rose this Rose vvith Truth's new-springing raies: And vvhen again the Gospels glorious Light Set in her Sisters superstitious Night, She sunk vvithall vnder afflictions streams (As sinks my Lotos vvith Sols setting beams): But, after Night, vvhen Light again appear'd, There-vvith, again her Royal Crown she rear'd; And in an Ile amid the Ocean set (Maugre the Deluge that Romes Dragon spet, With spightfull storms striuing to ouer-flowe her, And Spain conspiring ioyntly t' ouer-throwe-her) Her Maiden Flowr flourisht aboue the Water; Elizabeta Regina. Anagram Ei ben t'alza e gira. For, still Heav'ns Sun cherisht his louing Daughter: Bel fiord' Honor, ch'in Mare'l Mondo ammira, Al sole sacro, ch' Ei Ben T'Alza E Gira (So, my deer Wiat, honouring Still the same, In-soul'd an Imprese with her Anagramm): And last, for guerdon of her constant Loue, Rapt her intirely, to himselfe aboue. So set our Sun; and yet no Night ensu'd: So happily the Heav'ns our Light renu'd: For, in her stead, of the same Stock of Kings Another Flowr (or rather Phœnix) springs; Another like (or rather Still the same) No less in Loue with that Supernall Flame. So, to God's glory, and his Churches good, Th'honour of England, and the Royall blood, Long happy Monark may King Iames persist; And after him, His; Still the same in Christ. God, not content t'haue given these Plants of ours Of diuers hearbs and Plants, and of their excellent vertues. Precious Perfumes, Fruits, Plenty, pleasant Flowrs, Infused Physick in their leaues and Mores, To cure our sickness, and to salue our sores: Else doubt-less (Death assaults so many waies) Scarce could we liue a quarter of our Daies; But like the Flax, which flowrs at once and fals, Simile. One Feast would serue our Birth and Burials: Our Birth our Death, our Cradle (then) our Toomb, Our tender Spring our Winter would becom. Good Lord! how many gasping Soules haue scap't By th'ayd of Hearbs, for whom the Graue hath gap't; Who, euen about to touch the Stygian strand, Haue yet beguil'd grim Pluto's greedy hand! Beard-less Apollo's beardy Esculapius. Son did once With iuyce of Hearbs reioyn the scattered bones Of the chaste Hippolytus. Prince, that in th'Athenian Court Preferred Death before incestuous sport. So did Medea, for her Iason's sake, The frozen limbs of Æson youthfull make. O sacred Simples that our life sustain, And when it flies vs, call it back again! 'Tis not alone your liquor, inly taen, That oft defends vs from so many a baen: Put even your fauour, yea, your neighbour-hood, For some Diseases is exceeding good; Working so rare effects, that only such As feel, or see them, can beleeue so much. The vertue of Succorie. Of Swines-bread.Blew Succorie, hangd on the naked neck, Dispels the dimness that our sight doth check. Swines-bread, so vsed, doth not only speed A tardy Labour; but (without great heed) If over it a Child-great Woman stride, Instant abortion often doth betide. The burning Sun, the banefull Aconite, The poysonie Serpents that vnpeople quite Cyreniam Defarts, never Danger them That were about them th' Mugwart. Artemisian Stem.

If fuming boawls of Bacchus, in excess, Trouble thy brains with storms of giddiness, Saffron.Put but a garland of green Saffron on, And that mad humour will be quickly gon. Th'inchanting Charms of Syrens blandishments, Contagious Aire ingendring Pestilence, Infect not those that in their mouthes haue taen Angelica. Angelica, that happy counter-baen, Sent down from Heav'n by some Celestiall scout, As well the name and nature both avow't. Pimpernel or Burnett.So Pimpernel, held in the Patients hand, The bloody-Flix doth presently with-stand: Madder.And ruddy Madder's root, long handeled, Dies th'handlers vrine into perfect red. O Wondrous Woad! which, touching but the skin, Imparts his colour to the parts within. Nor (powerfull Hearbs) do we alonely find Your vertues working in fraile humane kind; But you can force the fiercest Animals, The fellest Fiends, the firmest Minerals, Yea, fairest Planers (if Antiquitie. Haue not bely'd the Haggs of Thessalie). Onely the touch of Choak-pard Lebbards bane. Aconite, Bereaues the Scorpion both of sense and might: Helleborus.As (opposite) Helleborus doth make His vitall powers from deadly slumber wake. With Betonie, fell Serpents round beset, Betonie.Lift vp their heads, and fall to hiss and spet, With spightfull fury in their sparkling eyes, Breaking all truce, with infinite defies: Puft vp with rage, to't by the ears the goe, Baen against baen, plague against plague they throwe, Charging each other with so fierce a force (For friends turn'd foes haue lightly least remorse) That wounded all (or rather all a wound) With poysoned gore they couer all the ground; And nought can stint their strange intestine strife, But onely th'end of their detested life. As Betonie breakes friendships ancient bands, So Willo-wort makes wonted hate shake hands: Willo-wort. For, being fastned to proud Coursers collers, That fight and fling, it will abate their cholers. The Swine, that feed in Troughes of Tamarice, Tamarice. Consume their spleen. The like effect there is In Finger-Ferne: which, being given to Swine, Finger-ferne. It makes their Milt to melt away in fine, With ragged tooth choosing the same so right Of all their Tripes to serue it's appetite. And Horse, that, feeding on the grassie Hils, Tread vpon Moon-wort Lunaria. with their hollow heels; Though lately shod, at night goe bare-foot home, Their Master musing where their shooes become. O Moon-wort! tell vs where thou hid'st the Smith, Hammer, and Pincers, thou vnshoo'st them with? Alas! what Lock or Iron Engine is't That can thy subtle secret strength resist, Sith the best Farrier cannot set a shoo So sure, but thou (so shortly) canst vndoo? But I suppose not, that the earth doth yeeld In Hill or Dale, in Forrest or in Field, A rarer Plant then Candian Dictaminsom Candia. Dittanie; Which wounded Dear eating, immediately Not onely cures their wounds exceeding well, But 'gainst the Shooter doth the shaft repell. Moreover (Lord) is't not a Work of thine Great varietie in colour and form of Plants, &amp; strange contraciety of effects, according to the bodies that they work vpon. That every where, in every Turfe we find Such multitude of other Plants to spring, In form, effect, and colour differing? And each of them in their due Seasons taen, To one is Physick, to another baen: Now gentle, sharp anon: now good, then ill: What cureth now, the same anon doth kill. Th'Hearb Fenel-gyant. Sagapen serues the slowe Asse for meat; But, kils the Ox if of the same he eat. So branched Hemlock. Hemlock for the Stares is fit; But, death to man, if he but taste of it. And Rose-bay. Oleander vnto beasts is poyson; But, vnto man a speciall counter-poyson. What ranker poyson? what more deadly baen Then Wolfes-bane. Aconite, can there be toucht or taen? And yet his iuice best cures the burning bit Of stinging Serpents, if apply'd to it. O valiant Venome! O courageous Plant! Disdainfull Poyson! noble combatant! That scorneth ayd, and loues alone to fight, That none partake the glory of his might: For, if he finde our bodies fore-possest With other Poyson, then he lets vs rest, And with his Rivall enters secret Duell, One to one, strong to strong, cruell to cruell, Still fighting fierce, and never over-giue Till they both dying, giue Man leaue to liue. And to conclude, whether I walke the Fields, Rush through the Woods, or clamber vp the Hils, I find God every-where: Thence all depend, He giveth frankly what we thankly spend. Heer for our food, Millions of flow'ry grains, Of grain, silke, Cotton-Wool (or Bombace) Flax &amp; Hemp which the Earth produceth.With long Mustachoes, waue vpon the Plains; Heer thousand fleeces, fit for Princes Robes, In Serean Forrests hang in silken Globes: Heer shrubs of Malta (for my meaner vse) The fine white balls of Bombace do produce. Heer th'azure-flowred Flax is finely spun For finest Linnen, by the Belgian Nun: Heer fatall Hemp, which Denmark doth afford, Doth furnish vs with Canvass, and with Cord, Cables and Sayles; that, Winds assisting either, We may acquaint the East and West together, And dry-foot dance on Neptunes Watry Front, And in adventure lead whole Towns vpon 't. Heer of one grain of Indian-wheat. Maiz, a Reed doth spring, That thrice a year, fiue hundred grains doth bring; Which (after) th'Indians parch, and pun, and knead, And thereof make them a most holesom bread. Th'Almighty Voice, which built this mighty Ball, Still, still rebounds and ecchoes over all: That, that alone, yearly the World reviues; Through that alone, all springs, all liues, all thriues: And that alone makes, that our mealy grain Our skilfull Seed-man scatters not in vain; But being covered by the tooth-full Harrow, Or hid a while vnder the folded furrow, Rots to reviue; and, warmly-wet, puts forth His root beneath, his bud aboue the Earth; Enriching shortly with his springing Crop, An exact description of the growing of wheat &amp; other like kinds of grauie.The Ground with green, the Husbandman with hope: The bud becomes a blade, the blade a reed, The reed an eare, the eare another seed: The feed, to shut the wastefull Sparrows out (In Haruest) hath a stand of Pikes about, And Chaffie Husks in hollow Cods inclose-it; Lest heat, wet, wind, should roste, or rot, or lose it: And left the Straw should not sustaine the eare, With knotty ioynts 'tis sheathed heer and there. Pardon me (Reader) if thy ravisht Eyes Haue seen To-Day too great varieties Of Trees, of Flowrs, of Fruits, of Hearbs, of Grains, In these my Groues, Meads, Orchards, Gardens, Plains; Sith th'Ile of Zebut's admirable Tree Beareth a fruit (call'd Cocos commonly) Of the Indian Cocos a most admirable fruit. The which, alone, far richer Wonders yeelds Then all our Groues, Meads, Orchards, Gardens, Fields. What? wouldst thou drink? the wounded leaues drop wine. Lack'st thou line linnen? dress the tender rine, Dress it like Flax, spin it, and weaue it well, It shall thy Cambrick and thy Lawn excell. Long'st thou for Butter? bite the poulpy part, And neuer better came to any Mart. Neodest thou Oyle? then boule it to and fro, And passing oyle it soon becommeth so. Or Vineger, to whet thine appetite? Then sun it well, and it will sharpely bite. Or want'st thou Sugar? steep the same a stound, And sweeter Sugar is not to be found. 'Tis what you will: or will be what you would: Should Mydas touch't (I think) it would be Gold. And God (I think) to crown our life with ioyes, The Earth with plenty, and his name with praise, Had don enough; if he had made no more But this one Plant so ful of wondrous store: Saue that, the World (where one thing breeds satiety) Could not be fair, without so great variety. But, th'Earth not onely on her back doth bear Abundant treasures glistring every where (As glorious vnthrifts, crost with Parents Curse, Wear golden Garments; but an empty Purse: Or Venus Darlings, fair without; within Full of Disease, full of Deceipt and Sin: Or stately Toombs, externly gilt and garnisht; With dust and bones in wardly fill'd and furnisht) But inwardly shee's no less fraught with riches, Nay rather more (which more our soules bewitches). Of the riches vnder or within the Earth. Within the deep folds of her fruitfull lap, So bound-less Mines of treasure doth she wrap, That th'hungry hands of humane avarice Cannot exhaust with labour or device. For, they be more then ther be Stars in Heav'n, Or stormy billowes in the Ocean driv'n, Or cares of Corn in Autumn on the Fields, Or Savage Beasts vpon a thousand Hils, Or Fishes diving in the silver Floods, Or scattred Leaues in Winter in the Woods. Of Minerals. Slat, Iet, and Marble shall escape my pen, I over-pass the Salt-mount Oromene, I blanch the Brine-Quar Hill in Aragon, Whence (there) they pouder their provision. I'le onely now emboss my Book with Brass, Dye't with Vermilion, deck't with Coperass, With Gold and Silver, Lead, and Mercury, Tin, Iron, Orpine, Stibium, Lethargy: And on my Gold-work I will onely place The Crystall pure, which doth reflect each face; The precious Ruby, of a Sanguin hew, Of precious stones.The Seal-fit Onyx, and the Saphire blew, The Cassidonie, full of circles round, The tender Topaz, and rich Diamond, The various Opal, and green Emerald, The Agate by a thousand titles call'd, The sky-like Turquez, purple Amethists, And fiery Carbuncle, which flames resists. I knowe, to Man the Earth seems (altogether) No more a Mother, but a Step-dame rather: Because (alas!) vnto our loss she bears Blood-shedding Steele, and Gold the ground of cares: As if these Metalls, and not Man's amiss, Had made Sin mount vnto the height it is. The vse, or abuse of things, make them good or euill: helpfull or hurtful to Mankind.But, as the sweet bait of aboundant Riches, Bodies and Soules of greedy men bewitches. Gold gilds the Vertuous, and it lends them wings To raise their thoughts vnto the rarest things. The wise, not onely Iron well apply For houshold turns, and Tools of Husbandry; But to defend their Countrey (when it cals) From forrain dangers, and intestine brals: But, with the same the wicked neuer mell, But to do seruice to the Haggs of Hell; To pick a Lock, to take his neighbours Purse, To break a House, or to doo somthing worse; To cut his Parents throat, to kill his Prince, To spoile his Countrey, murder Innocents. Even so, profaning of a gift diuine, The Drunkard drowns his Reason in the Wine: So sale-tongu'd Lawyers, wresting Eloquence, Excuse rich wrong, and cast poore Innocence: So Antichrists, their poyson to infuse, Miss-cite the Scriptures, and Gods name abuse. For, as a Cask, through want of vse grow'n fusty, Makes with his stink the best Greeke Malmsey musty: So God's best gifts, vsurpt by wicked Ones, To poyson turn through their contagions. But, shall I baulk th'admired Adamant? Of the rare vertue of the Load-stone. Whose dead-live power, my Reasons power doth dant. Renowned Load-stone, which on Iron acts, And by the touch the same aloofe attracts; Attracts it strangely with vnclasping crooks, With vnknow'n cords, with vnconceived hooks, With vnseen hands, with vndiscerned arms, With hidden Force, with sacred secret charms, Wherewith he wooes his Iron Misteriss, And never leaues her till he get a kiss; Nay, till he fold her in his faithfull bosom, Never to part (except we, loue-less, loose-em) With so firme zeale and fast affection The Stone doth loue the Steel, the Steel the Stone. And though somtime some Make-bate come betwixt, Still burns their first flame; 'tis so surely sixt: And, while they cannot meet to break their minds, With mutuall skips they shew their loue by signes (As bashfull Suters, seeing Strangers by, Parley in silence with their hand or eye). Who can conceiue, or censure in what sort One Loadstone-touched Ann'let doth transport Ano her Iron-Ring, and that another, Till foure or fiue hang dangling one in other? Greatest Apollo might he be (me thinks) Could tell the Reason of these hanging links: Sith Reason-scanners haue resolved all, That heavy things, hangd in the Aire, must fall. I am not ignorant, that He, who seeks In Roman Robes to sure the Sagest Greeks, Whose iealous wife, weening to home-revoke-him With a loue potion, did with poyson choak-him; Hath sought to showe, with arguing subtily, The secret cause of this rare Sympathy. But say (Lucretius) what's the hidden cause That toward the North-Star still the Needle draw's, Whose point is toucht with Load-stone? loose this knot, And still-green Laurell shall be still thy Lot: Yea, Thee more learned will I then confess, Then Epicurus, or Empedocles. W'are not to Ceres so much bound for Bread, Of the excellent vse of the Mariners Compasse. Neither to Bacchus, for his Clusters red, As (Signior Flauio) to thy witty triall, For first inuenting of the Sea-mans Diall (Th'vse of the Needle, turning in the same) Diuine deuice! O admirable Frame! Whereby, through th'Ocean, in the darkest night, Our hugest Caraques are conducted right: Whereby w'are stor'd with Truch-man, Guide, and Lamp To search all corners of the watery Camp: Whereby a Ship, that stormy Heav'ns haue whurld Neer in one Night into another World, Knowes where she is; and in the Card descries What degrees thence the Equinoctiall lies. Cleer-sighted Spirits, that cheer with sweet aspect My sober Rymes, though subiect to defect; If in this Volume, as you ouer-read it You meet some things seeming exceeding credit, Because (perhaps, heer proued yet by no man) Their strange effects be not in knowledge common: Think, yet, to some the Load stone's vse is new; And seems as strange, as we haue try'd it true: Let therefore that which Iron draw's, draw such To credit more then what they see or touch. Of medicinable Earths.Nor is th'Earth onely worthy praise eternall, For the rare riches on her back ex ernall, Or in her bosom: but her owne selfs worth Solicits me to found her glory forth. I call to witness all those weak diseased, Whose bodies oft haue by th'effects been eased Of Lemnos seal'd earth, or Eretrian soil, Or that of Chios, or of Melos Ile. The Earths Encamion.All-hail fair Earth, bearer of Towns and Towrs, Of Men, Gold, Grain, Physick, and Fruits and Flowrs, Fair, firm, and fruitfull, various, patient, sweet, Sumptuously cloathed in a Mantle meet Of mingled-colour; lac't about with Floods, And all embrodered with fresh blooming buds, With rarest Gemmes richly about embost, Excelling cunning, and exceeding cost. All hail great Heart, round Base, and stedfast Root, Of all the World, the Worlds strong fixed foot, Heav'ns chastest Spouse, supporter of this All, This glorious Buildings goodly Pedestall. All-hail deer Mother, Sister, Hostess, Nurse, Of the Worlds Soverain: of thy liberall purse, W' are all maintayned: match-less Emperess, To doo thee service with all readiness, The Sphears, before thee bear ten thousand Torches: The Fire, to warm thee, foulds his heatfull arches In purest flames aboue the floating Cloud: Th'Aire, to refresh thee, willingly is bow'd About the Waues, and well content to suffer Milde Zephyrs blasts, and Boreas bellowing rougher: Water, to quench thy thirst, about thy Mountains Wraps her moist arms, Seas, riuers, lakes and fountains. O how I grieue, deer Earth, that (given to gays) Commendations of the Country-life. Most of best wits contemn thee now a-days: And noblest hearts proudly abandon quight Study of Hearbs, and Country-lifes delight, To brutest men, to men of no regard, Whose wits are Lead, whose bodies Iron-hard. Such were not yerst the reuerend Patriarks, Whose praise is penned by the sacred Clarks. Noah the iust, meek Moses, Abraham (Who Father of the Faithfull Race becam) Were Shepheards all, or Husbandmen (at least) And in the Fields passed their Dayes the best. Such were not yerst Attalus, Philemetor, Archelaus, Hiero, and many a Pretor; Great Kings and Consuls, who haue oft for blades And glistering Scepters, handled hooks and spades. Such were not yerst, Cincinnatus Fabricius, Serranus, Curius, who vn-self-delicious, With Crowned Coulters, with Imperiall hands, With Ploughs triumphant plough'd the Roman lands. Great Scipio, sated with fain'd curtsie-capping, With Court-Eclipses, and the tedious gaping Of golden beggers: and that Emperour, Of Slaue, turn'd King; of King turn'd Labourer; In countrey Granges did their age confine: And ordered there, with as good Discipline, The Fields of Corn, as Fields of Combat first; And Ranks of Trees, as Ranks of Souldiers yerst. O thrice, thrice happy He, who shuns the cares Of City-troubles, and of State-affairs; And, serving Ceres, tils with his own Teem His own Free-land, left by his Friends to him! Never pale Envie's poysonie heads do hiss Free from enuy, ambition, and auarice and consequently from the diuelish practises of Machiauilian Politicks. To gnaw his heart; nor Vultur Avarice: His Field's bounds, bound his thoughts: he never sups, For Nectar, poyson mixt in silver Cups; Neither in golden Platters doth he lick For sweet Ambrosia deadly Arsenick: His hand's his boaul (better then Plate or Glass) The silver Brook his sweetest Hypocrass: Milk, Cheese, and Fruit (fruits of his own endeuour) Drest without dressing, hath he ready ever. False Counsailers (Concealers of the Law) Not vexed with co?terfait wreslings of wraigling Lawyers. Turn-coat Attourneys, that with both hands draw; Sly Peti-Foggers, Wranglers at the Bar, Proud Purse-Leaches, Harpies of Westminster, With fained chiding, and foul iarring noyse, Break not his Brain, nor interrupt his ioyes: But cheerfull Birds, chirping him sweet Good-morrows, With Natures Musick do beguile his sorrows; Teaching the fragrant Forrests, day by day, The Diapason of their Heav'nly Lay. Not dreading shipwrack nor in danger of Pirates.His wandring Vessell, reeling to and fro, On th'irefull Ocean (as the Windes do blowe) With sudden Tempest is not ouer-whurld, To seek his sad death in another World: But, leading all his life at home in Peace, Alwaies in sight of his own smoak; no Seas, No other Seas he knowes, nor other Torrent, Then that which waters, with his silver Current, His Natiue Medowes: and that very Earth Shall giue him Buriall, which first gaue him Birth. Not diseased in body through delicious Idleness.To summon timely sleep, he doth not need Æthyop's cold Rush, nor drowsie Poppy-seed; Nor keep in consort (as Mecænas did) Luxurious Villains (Viols I should haue said); But on green Carpets thrumd with mossie Beuer, Frenging the round Skirts of his winding River, The streams milde murmur, as it gently gushes, His healthy limbs in quiet slumber hushes. Not drawen by factions to an untimely Death.Drum, Fife, and Trumpet, with their loud A-larms, Make him not start out of his sleep, to Arms: Nor deer respect of some great Generall, Him from his bed vnto the block doth call. The crested Cock sings Hunt is vp to him, Limits his rest, and makes him stir betime, To walk the Mountains, or the flowry Meads, Impearld with tears, that sweet Aurora sheads. Not choaled with contagion of a corrupted Aire.Neuer gross Aire, poysond in stinking Streets, To choak his spirit, his tender nostrill meets; But th'open Sky, where at full breath he liues, Still keeps him sound, and still new stomack giues: And Death, drad Seriant of th'eternall Iudge, Comes very late to his sole-seated Lodge. Nor (Chamele?-like) changing, with euery obiect, the colour of his c?sience.His wretched years in Princes Courts he spends not: His thralled will on Great mens wils depends not: He, changing Master, doth not change at once His Faith; Religion, and his God renounce: With mercenary lies he doth not chant, Nor soothing Sin: nor lacking the Tayl of Greatness.Praysing an Emmet for an Elephant: Sardanapalus (drown'd in soft excess) For a triumphant vertuous Hercules; Thersites soul, for Venus louely Loue; And every Changeling for a Turtle-Doue; Nor lavishes in his lascivious layes, On wanton Flora, chaste Alcestes praise. But all self-private, serving God, he writes Fear-less, and sings but what his heart indites. No sallow, Fear doth day or night afflict-him: Neither prest with Fear, nor plotting Fraud. Vnto no fraud doth night or day addict-him; Or if he muse on guile, 'tis but to get Beast, Bird, or Fish, in toil, or snare, or net. What though his Wardrobe be not stately stuft With sumptuous silks (pinked, and pounc't, and puft) With gold-ground Velvets, and with silver Tissue, And all the glory of old Eues proud Issue? What though his feeble Cofers be not cramd With Misers Idols, golden Ingots ramd? He is warm-wrapped in his owne-growen Wooll; Of vn-bought Wines his Cellar's ever full; His Garner's stor'd with grain, his Ground with flocks, His Barns with Fodder, with sweet streams his Rocks. For, heer I sing the happy Rusticks weal, Whose handsom house seems as a Common-weal: And not the needy, hard rack-rented Hinde, Or Copy-holder, whom hard Lords do grinde; The pined Fisher or poor-Daiery-Renter That liues of whay, for forfeiting Indenture; Who scarce haue bread within their homely Cotes (Except by fits) to feed their hungry throats. Let me, good Lord, among the Great vn-kend, My rest of dayes in the calm Countrey end. Let me deserue of my deer Eagle-Brood, For Windsor-Forrest, walks in Almes-wood: Bee Hadley Pond my Sea; Lambs-bourn my Thames; Lambourn my London; Kennet's silver streams, My fruitfull Nile; my Singers and Musicians, The pleasant Birds with warbling repetitions; My company, pure thoughts, to work thy will; My Court, a Cottage on a lowely Hill; Where, without let, I may so sing thy Name, That times to come may wonder at the same. Or, if the new North-star, my Soverain Iames (The secret vertue of whose sacred beams Attracts th'attentiue seruice of all such Whose mindes did euer Vertue's Load-stone touch) Shall euer daign t'inuite mine humble Fate T'approach the Presence of his Royall State: Or, if my Duty or the Grace of Nobles, Shall driue or draw me neer their pleasing-Troubles; Let not their Fauours make me drunk with folly: In their Commands, still keep my Conscience holy: Let mee, true Honour, not the false delight; And play the Preacher, not the Parasite. So Morne and Euening the Third Day conclude, And God perceiu'd that all his works were good. THE FOVRTH DAY OF THE FIRST WEEK. The Argvment. The twinkling Spangles of the Firmament: The wandring Seav'n (Each in a seuerall Tent); Their Course, their Force, their Essence is disputed; That they (as Beasts) do eat and drink; refuted. Heav'ns (not the Earth) with rapid motion roule: The famous Stars observ'd in either Pole: Heav'ns sloaping Belt: the Twelue celestiall Signes Where Sol the Seasons of the Year confines: Dayes glorious Prince: Nights gloomy Patroness: His Light and Might: Her constant Change-fulness. In the beginning of the fourth book alling vpon the God of Heauen, our Poet prayeth to be lift vp in the Heauens, that he may discourse (as be ought) of the starrs fixed and wandring. Pvre Spirit that rapt'st aboue the Firmest Sphear, In fiery Coach, thy faithfull Messenger, Who smiting Iordan with his pleighted Cloak, Did yerst divide the Waters with the stroak: O! take me vp; that, far from Earth, I may From Sphear to Sphear, see th'azure Heav'ns To-Day. Be thou my Coach-man, and now Cheek by Ioule With Phœbus Chariot let my Chariot roule; Driue on my Coach by Mars his flaming Coach; Saturn and Luna let my wheels approach: That having learn'd of their Fire breathing Horses, Their course, their light, their labour, and their forces, My Muse may sing in sacred Eloquence, To Vertues Friends, their vertuous Excellence: And with the Load-stone of my conquering Verse, Aboue the Poles attract the most perverse. And you fair learned soules, you spirits diuine, To whom the Heav'ns so nimble quils assigne, As well to mount, as skilfully to limn The various motion of their Tapers trim; Lend me your hand; lift me aboue Parnassus; With your loud Trebbles help my lowly Bassus. For sure, besides that your wit-gracing Skill Bears, in it selfe, it self's rich guerdon still; Our Nephews, free from sacrilegious brauls, Where Horror swims in blood about our wals, Shall one day sing that your deer Song did merit Better Heav'n, hap, and better time to hear-it. And, though (alas!) my now new-rising Name Can hope heer-after none, or little Fame: The time that most part of our better wits Mis-spend in Flattery, or in Fancy-Fits, In courting Ladies, or in clawing Lords, Without affection, in affected words: I mean to spend, in publishing the Storie Of Gods great works, to his immortall glorie. My rymes begot in pain, and born in pleasure, Thirst not for Fame (the Heathens hope's chiefe treasure): 'T shall me suffice, that our deer France do breed (In happy season) some more learned seed, That may record with more diuine dexterity Then I haue done, these wonders to Posterity. Much less may these abortiue Brats of Mine Expect respect (but in respect of Thine): Yet sith the Heav'ns haue thus entaskt my layes (As darkly Cynthia darts her borrow'd rayes) To shadow Thine; and to my Countrey render Some small reflection of thy radiant splendor; It is enough, if heer-by I incite Some happier spirit to do thy Muse more right; And with more life giue thee thy proper grace, And better follow great du Bartas trace. God's None of these faint idle Artizans, Heer resuming his course, hee prosecutes the work of the Creation. Who at the best abandon their designes, Working by halfs; as rather a great deal, To do much quickly, then to do it well: But rather, as a work-man never weary, And all-sufficient, he his works doth carry To happy end; and to perfection, With sober speed, brings what he hath begun. In the fourth day, God created the fixed Stars, the two great Lights, (vis.) the Son and the Moon, together with the other fiue Planets.Hauing therefore the Worlds wide Curten spred About the circuit of the fruitfull Bed, Where (to fill all with her vnnumbred Kin) Kind Natures selfe each moment lyeth-in: To make the same for ever admirable, More stately-pleasant, and more profitable; He th'Azure Tester rimm'd with golden marks, And richly spangled with bright glistring sparks. I knowe, those Tapers, twinkling in the sky, Do turn so swiftly from our hand and eye, That man can neuer (rightly) reach, to seeing Of their Course, Force, Essence, and Substance.Their Course and Force, and much-much less their Being: But, if coniecture may extend aboue To that great Orb, whose moving All doth moue, Th'imperfect Light of the first Day was it, Which for Heav'ns Eyes did shining matter fit: For, God, selecting lightest of that Light, Garnisht Heav'ns sieling with those Torches bright: Or else diuided it; and pressing close The parts, did make the Sun and Stars of those. Opinion of the Greek touching the matter of the Stars.But, if thy wits thirst rather seek these things, In Greekish Cisterns then in Hebrew Springs; I then conclude, that as of moistfull matter, God made the people that frequent the Water; And of an Earthy stuff the stubborn droues That haunt the Hils and Dales, and Downs and Groues: So, did he make, by his Almighty might, The Heav'ns and Stars, of one same substance bright; To th'end these Lamps, dispersed in the Skies, Might with their Orb, it with them, sympathize. And as (with vs) vnder the Oaked barke Simile.The knurry knot with branching veines, we marke To be of substance all one with the Tree, Although farr thicker and more rough it be: So those gilt studs in th'vpper story driv'n, Are nothing but the thickest part of Heav'n. Their substance is of Fire.When I obserue their Light and Heaty blent (Meer accidents of th'vpper Element) I think them Fire: but not such Fire as lasts No longer then the fuell that it wastes: For then, I think all th'Elements too-little To furnish them only with one dayes victuall. Refutation of such as haue thought that the Stars were lining creatures that did eat &amp; drink.And therefore smile I at those Fable-Forges, Whose busie-idle stile so stifly vrges, The Heav'ns bright Cressets to be living creatures, Ranging for food, and hungry fodder-eaters; Still sucking-vp (in their eternall motion) The Earth for meat, and for their drink, the Ocean. Sure, I perceiue no motion in a Star, But naturall, certain, and regular; Whereas, Beasts motions infinitely vary, Confus'd, vncertain, diuers, voluntary. I see not how so many golden Posts Should scud so swift about Heav'ns azure coasts, But that the Heavn's must ope and shut som-times, Subiect to passions, which our earthly climes Alter, and toss the Sea, and th'Aire estrange From itselfs temper with exceeding change. I see not how, in those round blazing beams, One should imagine any food-fit limbs: Nor can I see how th'Earth, and Sea should feed So many Stars, whose greatness doth exceed So many times (if Star-Diuines say troth) The greatness of the Earth and Ocean both: Sith heer our Cattle, in a month, will eat Seav'n-times the bulk of their own bulk in meat. These Torches then range not at random, o're The lightsom thickness of an vn-firm Floor: As heer belowe, diuersly mooving them, The painted Birds between two aires do swim; But, rather fixed vnto turning Sphears, Ay, will-they, nill-they, follow their careers: As Car-nails fastned in a wheel (without Simile. Selfs-motion) turn with others turns about. As th'Ague sicke, vpon his shivering pallet, A Comparison. Delayes his health oft to delight his palat; When wilfully his taste-less Taste delights In things vnsauory to sound Appetites: Even so, some brain-sicks liue there now-adayes, That lose themselues still in contrary wayes; Prepostrous Wits that cannot rowe at ease, On the smooth Chanell of our common Seas. And such are those (in my conceit at least) Those Clarks that think (think how absurd a iest) That neither Heav'ns nor Stars do turn at all, Nor dance about this great round Earthly Ball; But th'Earth it self, this Massie Globe of ours, Turns round-about once euery twice-twelue hours: And we resemble Land-bred nouices New brought aboord to venture on the Seas; Who, at first lanching from the shoar, suppose The ship stands still, and that the ground it goes. So, twinkling Tapers, that Heav'ns Arches fill, Equally distant should continue still. Opinion of Copernicus c?futed. So, neuer should an Arrow, shot vpright, In the same place vpon the Shooter light; But would doo (rather) as (at Sea) a stone Aboord a Ship vpward vprightly throw'n; Which not within-boord fall's, but in the Flood A-stern the Ship, if so the winde be good. So, should the Fowls that take their nimble flight From Western Marches towards Mornings Light; And Zephyrus, that in the Summer time Delights to visit Eurus in his clime; And Bullets thundred from the Cannons throat (Whose roaring drowns the Heav'nly thunders note) Should seem recoil: sithens the quick career, That our round Earth should daily gallop heer, Must needs exceed a hundred-fold (for swift) Birds, Bullets, Winds; their wings, their force, their drift. Arm'd with these reasons, 'twere superfluous T'assaile the reasons of Copernicus; Who, to salue better of the Stars th'appearance, Vnto the Earth a three-fold motion warrants: Leauing to dispute farther vpon the former Paradox, be proceedeth in his discourse, &amp; by a liuely comparison representeth the beautifull ornament of the Heavens about the Earth.Making the Sun the Center of this All, Moon, Earth, and Water, in one only Ball. But sithens heer, nor time, nor place doth sute, His Paradox at length to prosecute; I will proceed, grounding my next discourse On the Heav'ns motions, and their constant course. I oft admire greatness of mighty Hils, And pleasant beauty of the flowry Fields, And count-less number of the Oceans sand, And secret force of sacred Adamant: But much-much more (the more I mark their course) Stars glistering greatness, beauty, number, force. Simile.Even as a Peacock, prickt with loues desire, To woo his Mistress, strowting stately by her, Spreads round the rich pride of his pompous vail, His azure wings and starry-golden tail; With rattling pinions wheeling still about, The more to set his beautious beauty out: The Firmament (as feeling like aboue) Displayes his pomp; pranceth about his Loue, Spreads his blew curtain, mixt with golden marks, Set with gilt spangles, sow'n with glistring sparks, Sprinkled with eyes, specked with Tapers bright, Poudred with Stars streaming with glorious light, T'inflame the Earth the more, with Louers grace, To take the sweet fruit of his kind imbrace. The number of Stars vnder both the Poles innumerable.Hee, that to number all the Stars would seek, Had need inuent som new Arithmetick; And who, to cast that Reck'ning takes in hand, Had need for Counters take the Ocean's sand: Yet haue our wise and learned Elders found And why the ancient Astronomers obserued 48. Foure-dozen Figures in the Heav'nly Round, For aid of memory; and to our eyes In certain Howses to diuide the Skyes. Of those, are Twelue in that rich Girdle greft Of the signes in the Zodiacke. Which God gaue Nature for her New-years-gift (When making All, his voyce Almighty most, Gaue so fair Laws vnto Heav'ns shining Hoast) To wear it biaz, buckled over-thwart-her; Not round about her swelling waste, to girt-her. This glorious Baldrick of a Golden tindge, Imbost with Rubies, edg'd with Silver Frindge, Buckled with Gold, with a Bend glistring bright, Heav'ns biaz-wise environs day and night. For, from the period, where the Ram doth bring The Zodiacke. The day and night to equall balancing, Ninty degrees towards the North it wends, Thence iust as much toward Mid-Heav'n it bends, As many thence toward the South; and thence Towards th'Years Portall, the like difference. Nephelian Crook-horn, with brass Cornets crown'd, Thou buttest brauely 'gainst the New years bound; Aries Mid-March begins the Spring. And richly clad in thy fair Golden Fleece, Doo'st hold the First House of Heav'ns spacious Meese. Thou spy'st anon the Bull behinde thy back: Taurus in mid-Aprill. Who, lest that fodder by the way he lack, Seeing the World so naked; to renew't, Coats th'infant Earth in a green gallant sute; And, without Plough or Yoak, doth freely fling Through fragrant Pastures of the flowry Spring. The Twins, whose heads, arms, shoulders, knees and feet, Gemini in mid-May. God fill'd with Stars to shine in season sweet, Contend in Course, who first the Bull shall catch, That neither will nor may attend their match. Then, Summers-guide, the Crab comes rowing soft, Cancer in mid-Iune begins the Sommer. With his eight owres through the Heav'ns azure loft; To bring vs yeerly, in his starry shell, Many long dayes the shaggy Earth to swele. Almost with like pase leaps the Lion out, Leo in mid-Iuly. All clad with flames, bristled with beams about; Who, with contagion of his burning breath, Both grass and grain to cinders withereth. The Virgin next, sweeping Heav'ns azure Globe Virgo in mid-August. With stately train of her bright Golden robe, Milde-proudly marching in her left hand brings A sheaf of Corn, and in her right hand wings. Libra in mid-September begins Autumns.After the Maiden, shines the Balance bright, Equall diuider of the Day and Night: In whose gold Beam, with three gold rings there fastens With six gold strings, a pair of golden Basens. The spitefull Scorpion, next the Scale addrest, Scorpio in mid-October.With two bright Lamps couers his loathsom brest; And fain, from both ends, with his double sting, Would spet his venom over everything; Sagittarius in mid-Nouember.But that the braue Half-horse Phylerian Scout, Galloping swift the heav'nly Belt about, Ay fiercely threats, with his flame-feathered arrow To shoot the sparkling starry Viper thorough. Capricornus in mid-December, beginneth Winter.And th'hoary Centaure, during all his Race, Is so attentiue to this onely chase, That dread-less of his dart, Heav'ns shining Kid Comes iumping light, iust at his heels vnspid. Aquarius in mid-Ianuary.Mean-while the Skinker, from his starry spout, After the Goat, a silver stream pours-out; Distilling still out of his radiant Fire Rivers of Water (who but will admire?) In whose cleer chanel mought at pleasure swim Pisces in mid-February.Those two bright Fishes that do follow him; But that the Torrent slides so swift away, That it out-runs them ever, even as they Out-run the Ram, who ever them pursues; And by renewing Yearly, all renues. The names of the Principall stars of the North Pole.Besides these Twelue, toward the Artick side, A flaming Dragon doth Two-Bears diuide; After, the Wainman comes, the Crown, the Spear; The Kneeling Youth, the Harp, the Hamperer Of th'hatefull Snake (whether we call the same By Æsculapius, or Alcides name) Swift Pegasus, the Dolphin, louing man; Ioues stately Ægle, and the silver Swan: Andromeda, with Cassiopeia neer-her, Her father Cepheus, and her Perseus deerer: The shining Triangle, Medusa's Tress, And the bright Coach-man of Tindarides. The names of the Stars of the South-Pole.Toward th'other Pole, Orion, Eridanus, The Whale, the Whelp, and hot-breath't Sirius, The Hare, the Hulk, the Hydra, and the Boule, The Centaure, Wolf, the Censer, and the Foule (The twice-foul Rauen) the Southern Fish and Crown, Through Heav'ns bright Arches brandish vp and down. The fixed stars are in the eight Heauen.Thus on This-Day working th'eightth azure Tent, With Art-less Art, diuinely excellent; Th'Almighties finger fixed many a million Of golden Scutchions in that rich Pavillion: But in the rest (vnder that glorious Heav'n) But one a-peece, vnto the severall Seav'n; And the seauen Planets vnder them each in his proper Sphear. Lest, of those Lamps the number-passing number Should mortall eyes with such confusion cumber, That we should never, in the cleerest night, Stars diuers Course see or discern aright. And therefore also, all the fixed Tapers He made to twinkle with such trembling capers Why the Planets twinkle not, &amp; the fixed stars do twinkle. But, the Seauen Lights that wander vnder them, Through various passage, never shake a beam. Or, he (perhaps) made them not different; But, th'hoast of Sparks spred in the Firmament Far from our sense, through distance infinite, Seems but to twinkle, to our twinkling sight: Whereas the rest, neerer a thousand fold The firmament much farther from the Earth th? the Sphears of the Planets. To th'Earth and Sea, wee doo more brim behold. For, the Heav'ns are not mixtly enterlaced; But th'vndermost by th'vpper be imbraced, And more or less their roundels wider are, As from the Center they be neer or far: As in an Egg, the shell includes the skin, The skin the white, the white the yolk with-in. Simile. Now as the Winde, buffing vpon a Hill With roaring breath against a ready Mill, Two similes representing the motion of the eight interiour Heav'ns, throgh the swift turning of the ninth which is the Primum Mobile. Whirls with a whiff the sails of swelling clout, The sails doo swing the winged shaft about, The shaft the wheel, the wheel the trendle turns, And that the stone which grinds the flowry corns: Or like as also in a Clock well tended, Iust counter-poize, iustly thereon suspended, Makes the great Wheel goe round, and that anon Turns with his turning many a meaner one, The trembling watch and th'iron Maule that chimes The intire Day in twice twelue equall times: So the grand Heav'n, in foure and twenty hours, Surveying all this various house of ours, With his quick motion all the Sphears doth moue; Whose radiant glances gild the World aboue, And driues them every day (which swiftness strange-is) From Gange to Tagus; and from Tay to Ganges. But, th'vnder-Orbs, as grudging to be still So straightly subiect to anothers will, Each of the 8. Heaven so transported by the Primum Mobile hath also his proper oblique and distinct course each from other. Still without change, still at anothers pleasure After one pipe to dance one onely measure; They from-ward turn, and traversing aside, Each by himselfe an oblique course doth slide: So that they all (although it seeme not so) Forward and backward in one instant go, Both vp and down, and with contrary pases, At once they poste to two contrary places: Like as my selfe, in my lost Marchant-years The same explaned by a proper Simile. (A loss, alas, that in these lines appears) Wafting, to Brabant, Englands golden Fleece (A richer prize then Iason brought to Greece) While toward the Sea, our (then, Swan-poorer) Thames Bare down my Bark vpon her ebbing streams: Vpon the hatches, from the Prow to Poup Walking in compass of that narrow Coop, Maugre the most that Winde and Tide could doo, Haue gone at once towards Lee and London too. Why som of these Heauens haue a slower course &amp; shorter compasse then other som.But now, the neerer, any of these Eight, Approach th'Empyreall Palace wals in height, The more their circuit, and more dayes they spend, Yer they return vnto their Iourneys end. It's therefore thought, That sumptuous Canapy, The terme of the reuolution of the Firmament.The which th'vn-niggard hand of Maiesty Poudred so thick with Shields so shining cleer, Spends in his voyage nigh seaven thousand yeer. Of the seuenth, which is the Sphear of Saturn.Ingenious Saturn, Spouse of Memory, Father of th'Age of Gold; though coldly dry, Silent and sad, bald, hoary, wrinkle-faced, Yet art thou first among the Planets placed: And thirty years thy Leaden Coach doth run Yer it arriue where thy Career begun. Of the 6. which is the Sphear of Iupiter.Thou, rich, benign, Ill-chasing Iupiter, Art (worthy) next thy Father sickle-bear: And while thou doost with thy more milde aspect His froward beams disastrous frouns correct, Thy Tinnen Chariot shod with burning bosses, Through twice-six Signes in twice six twelue months crosses. Of the 5. which is the Sphear of Mars.Braue-minded Mars (yet Master of mis-order, Delighting nought but Battails, blood, and murder) His furious Coursers lasheth night and day, That he may swiftly passe his course away: But in the road of his eternall Race, So many rubs hinder his hasty pase, That thrice, the while, the lively Liquor-God With dabbled heels hath swelling clusters trod, And thrice hath Ceres shav'n her amber tress, Yet his steel wheels haue done their business. Of the 4. which is the Sphear of Sol..Pure goldy-locks, Sol, States-friend, Honour giuer, Light-bringer, Laureat, Leach-man, all Reviuer, Thou, in three hundred threescore dayes and fiue, Doost to the period of thy Race arriue. For, with thy proper course thou measur'st th'Year, And measur'st Dayes with thy constrain'd career. Fair dainty Venus, whose free vertues milde Of the 3. which is the Sphear of Venus. With happy fruit get all the world with-childe (Whom wanton dalliance, dancing, and delight, Smiles, witty wiles, youth, loue, and beauty bright, With soft blind Cupids evermore consort) Of lightsom Day opens and shuts the port; For, hardly dare her siluer Doues goe far From bright Apollos glory-beaming Car. Not much vnlike so, Mercury the witty, Of the 2. which is the Sphear of Mercury. For ship, for shop, book, bar, or Court, or Citty: Smooth Orator, swift Pen-man, sweet Musician, Rare Artizan, deep-reaching Politician, Fortunat Marchant, fine Prince-humour-pleaser; To end his course takes neer a twelue-months leasure: For, all the while, his nimble winged heels Dare little bouge from Phœbus golden wheels. And lastly Luna; thou cold Queen of Night, Of the 1. which is the Sphear of Luna. Regent of humors, parting Months aright, Chaste Emperess, to one Endymion constant; The lowest Planet nearest the Earth. Constant in Loue, though in thy looks inconstant (Vnlike our Loues, whose hearts dissemble soonest) Twelue times a year through all the Zodiack runnest. Now, if these Lamps, so infinite in number, Should still stand-still as in a sloathfull slumber, Then should some Places (alwaies in one plight) Haue alwaies Day, and some haue alwaies Night: Then should the Summers Fire, and Winters Frost, Of the necessity of diuers moti?s of the Heauens. Rest opposite still on the selfe same Coast: Then nought could spring, and nothing prosper would In all the World, for want of Heat or Cold. Or, without change of distance or of dance, If all these Lights still in one path should prance, Th'inconstant parts of this lowe Worlds contents Should never feele so sundry accidents, As the Coniunction of celestiall Features Incessantly pours vpon mortall Creatures. I'l ne'r beleeue that the Arch-Architect Of the force and influence of the Cœlestiall bodies vpon the terrestriall. With all these Fires the Heav'nly Arches deckt Onely for Shew, and with these glistering shields T'amaze poor Shepheards watching in the fields. I'l ne'r beleeue that the least Flowr that pranks Our Garden borders, or the Common banks, And the least stone that in her warming Lap Our kind Nurse Earth doth covetously wrap, Hath some peculiar vertue of it owne; And that the glorious Stars of Heav'n haue none: But shine in vain, and haue no charge precise, But to be walking in Heav'ns Galleries, And through that Palace vp and down to clamber, As golden Guls about a Princes Chamber. Sens-less is he, who (without blush) denies What to sound senses most apparent lies: And 'gainst experience he that spets Fallacians, Is to be hist from learned Disputations: And such is he, that doth affirm the Stars To haue no force on these inferiours; Though Heav'ns effects we most apparent see In number more then heav'nly Torches be. Sundry proofs of the same. 1. The diuers seasons. 2. The fearfull accidents that commonly succeed Eclipses.I nill alledge the Seasons alteration, Caus'd by the Sun in shifting Habitation: I will not vrge, that never at noon dayes His envious Sister intercepts his Rayes But som great State eclipseth, and from Hell Alecto looses all these Furies Fell, Grim, lean-fac't Famine, foul infectious Plague; Blood-thirsty War, and Treason hatefull Hag: Heer pouring down Woes vniversall Flood, To drown the World in Seas of Tears and Blood. 3. The ebbing &amp; flowing of the Sea.I'l over-pass how Sea doth Eb and Flowe, As th'Horned Queen doth either shrink or growe; And that the more she Fills her forked Round, 4. The increase and decrease of marrow, blood and humours in diuers creatures.The more the Marrow doth in Bones abound, The Blood in Veines, the sap in Plants, the Moisture And lushious meat, in Creuish, Crab and Oyster: That Oak, and Elm, and Firr, and Alder, cut Before the Crescent haue her Corners shut, Are never lasting, for the builders turn, In Ship or House, but rather fit to burn: 5. The apparent alterations in the bodies of sick persons.And also, that the Sick, while she is filling, Feele sharper Fits through all their members thrilling. So that, this Lamp alone approoues, what powrs, Heav'ns Tapers haue even on these soules of ours: Temp'ring, or troubling (as they be inclin'd) Our mind and humours, humours and our minde, Through Sympathy, which while this Flesh we carry, Our Soules and Bodies doth together marry. A particular proofe by the effects of certain notable stars, ordinarily noted in some Month of the year.I'l onely say, that sith the hot aspect Of th'Heav'nly Dog-Star, kindles with effect A thousand vnseen Fires, and dries the Fields, Scorches the Vallies, parches-vp the Hils, And often times into our panting hearts, The bitter Fits of burning Fevers darts: And (opposit) the Cup, the dropping Pleiades, Bright glistering Orion and the weeping Hyades, Never (almost) look down on our aboad, But that they stretch the Waters bounds abroad; With Clowdy horror of their wrathfull frown, Threatning again the guilty World to drown: And (to be brief) sith the gilt azure Front Of Firmest Sphear hath scarce a spark vpon't But poureth down-ward som apparent change, Towards the Storing of the Worlds great Grange; We may coniecture what hid powr is given T'infuse among vs from the other Seaven, From each of those which for their vertue rare Th'Almighty placed in a proper Sphear. Not that (as Stoïks) I intend to tye Reiecting the Stoiks, he sheweth that God, as the first Cause, doth orace all things, &amp; what vse we should make of the force Course, &amp; Light of the celestiall bodies. With Iron Chains of strong Necessity Th'Eternal's hands, and his free feet enstock In Destinies hard Diamantine Rock: I hold, that God (as The First Cause) hath giv'n Light, Course, and Force to all the Lamps of Heav'n: That still he guides them, and his Providence Disposeth free, their Fatall influence: And that therefore (the rather) we belowe Should study all, their Course and Force to knowe: To th'end that, seeing (through our Parents Fall) T'how many Tyrants we are wexen thrall, Euer since first fond Womans blind Ambition, Breaking, made Adam break Heav'ns High-Commission: We might vnpuff our Heart and bend our Knee, T'appease with sighs Gods wrathfull Maiestie; Beseeching him to turn away the storms Of Hail, and Heat, Plague, Dearth, and dreadfull Arms, Which oft the angry Stars, with bad aspects, Threat to be falling on our stubborn necks: To giue vs Curbs to bridle th'ill proclivitie We are inclin'd-to, by a hard Nativitie: To pour some Water of his Grace, to quench Our boyling Fleshes fell Concupiscer ce, To calm our many passions (spirituall tumours) Sprung from corruption of our vicious humours. Latonian Twins, Parents of Years and Months, Heer proceeding to the second part of this book, he treateth at large of the Sun &amp; Moon. Alas! why hide you so your shining Fronts? What? nill you shew the splendor of your ray, But through a Vail of mourning Clouds I pray? I pray pull-off your mufflers and your mourning, And let me see you in your natiue burning: And my deer Muse by her eternall flight, Shall spread as far the glory of your Light As you your selues run, in alternat Ring, Day after Night, Night after Day to bring. Thou radiant Coach-man, running endless course, Of the Sun: entring into the description whereof he confesseth that he knowes not well where to begin. Fountain of Heat, of Light the liuely sourse, Life of the World, Lamp of this Vniverse, Heav'ns richest Gemm: O teach me where my Verse May but begin thy praise. Alas! I fare Much like to one that in the Clouds doth stare To count the Quails, that with their shadow cover Th'Italian Sea, when soaring higher over, Fain of a milder and more fruitfull Clime, They come, with vs to pass the Summer time: No sooner he begins one shoal to summ, But more and more, still greater shoals do com, Swarm vpon Swarm, that with their count-less number Break off his purpose, and his sense incumber. The Sun as Prince of the Celestiall lights marcheth in the midst of the other six Planets which inuiron him.Dayes glorious Eye! Even as a mighty King, About his Countrey stately Progressing, Is compast round with Dukes, Earles, Lords, and Knights, (Orderly marshall'd in their noble Rites) Esquires and Gentlemen, in courtly kinde And then his Guard before him and behinde; And there is nought in all his Royall Muster, But to his Greatnes addeth grace and lustre: So, while about the World thou ridest ay, Which onely liues by vertue of thy Ray, Six Heav'nly Princes, mounted evermore, Wait on thy Coach, three behinde, three before, Besides the Hoasts of th'vpper Twinklers bright, To whom, for pay thou giuest onely Light. And, ev'n as Man (the little-World of Cares) The Sun is in Heauen as the heart in mans body.Within the Middle of the bodie, beares His heart (the Spring of life) which with proportion Supplyeth spirits to all, and euery portion: Even so (O Sun) thy Golden Chariot marches Amid the six Lamps of the six lowe Arches Which feel the World, that equally it might Richly impart them Beautie, Force, and Light. His notable effects vpon the Earth.Praising thy Heat, which subtilly doth pearce The solid thickness of our Vniverse, Which in th'Earths kidnyes Mercury doth burn, And pallid Sulphur to bright Metall turn; I do digress, to praise that light of thine, Which if it should, but one Day, cease to shine, Th'vnpurged Aire to Water would resolue, And Water would the mountain tops inuolve. Scarce I begin to measure thy bright Face, Whose greatness doth so oft Earths greatness pass, And with still running the Cœlestiall Ring, Is seen and felt of euery liuing thing; But that fantastickly I change my Theam To sing the swiftness of thy tyer-less Teem; To sing, how, Rising from the Indian Waue, Excellent comparisons borrowed out of the 19. Psalm. Thou seem'st (O Titan) like a Bride-groom braue, Who from his Chamber early issuing out In rich array, with rarest Gems about; With pleasant Countenance, and louely Face, With golden tresses, and attractiue grace, Cheers (at his comming) all the youthfull throng That for his presence earnestly did long, Blessing the day, and with delightfull glee, Singing aloud his Epithalamie. Then, as a Prince that feeles his Noble heart, Wounded with Loues pure Honor-winged dart (As Hardy Lælivs, that great Garter-Knight, The same exemplified in an honorable personage of our time now very aged: but in his yong years, the glory of Arms and Chiualrie. Tilting in Triumph of Eliza's Right (Yeerly that Day that her deer raign began) Most brauely mounted on proud Rabican, All in gilt armour, on his glistering Mazor A stately Plume, of Orange mixt with Azur, In gallant Course, before ten thousand eyes, From all Defendants bore the Princely Prize) Thou glorious Champion, in thy Heav'nly Race, Runnest so swift we scarce conceiue thy Pase. When I record, how fitly thou dost guide Of Gods wonderfull prouidence in placing the Sun in the midst of the other Planets, &amp; of the commodities that come thereof. Through the fourth Heav'n, thy flaming Coursers pride, That as they pass, their fiery breaths may temper Saturn's and Cynthia's cold and moist distemper (For, if thou gallop'tst in the neather Room Like Phaëton, thou would'st the World consume: Or, if thy Throne were set in Saturn's Sky, For want of heat, then euery thing would dy) In the same instant I am prest to sing, How thy return reviveth every thing; How, in thy Presence, Fear, Sloath, Sleep, and Night, Snowes, Fogs, and Fancies, take their sudden Flight Th'art (to be briefe) an Ocean wanting bound, Where (as full vessels haue the lesser sound) Plenty of Matter makes the speaker mute; As wanting words thy worth to prosecute. Yet glorious Monarch, 'mong so many rare And match-less Flowrs as in thy Garland are, Of the Sunnes continuall and daily course. Some one or two shall my chaste sober Muse For thine Immortall sacred Sisters chuse. I'l boldly sing (bright Soverain) thou art none Of those weak Princes Flattery works vpon (No second Edvvard, nor no Richard Second, Vn-kinged both, as Rule-vnworthy recon'd) Who, to inrich their Minions past proportion, Pill all their Subiects with extream extortion; And charm'd with Pleasures (O exceeding Pity!) Lie alwaies wallowing in one wanton City; And, loving only that, to mean Lieutenants Farm out their Kingdoms care, as vnto Tenants. For, once a day, each Countrey vnder Heav'n Thou bidst Good-Morow, and thou bidst Good-Ev'n. And thy far-seeing Eye, as Censor, views The rites and fashions. Fish and Foule do vse, And our behauiours, worthy (euery one) Th'Abderian Laughter, and Ephesian Mone. But true it is, to th'end a fruitfull lew Of his oblique or By-course, cause of the foure seasons: and of the commodities of all Climats in the world.May every Climat in his time renew, And that all men may nearer in all Realms Feel the alternat vertue of thy beams; Thy sumptuous Chariot, with the Light returning, From the same Portall mounts not every Morning: But, to make know'n each-where thy daily drift, Doo'st every day, thy Coursers Stable shift: That while the Spring, prankt in her greenest pride, Raigns heer, else-where Autumn as long may bide; And while fair Summers heat our fruits doth ripe, Cold Winters Ice may other Countries gripe. No sooner doth thy shining Chariot Roule A pleasant and liuely descripti? of the foure seasons of the year.From highest Zenith toward Northren Pole, To sport thee for three Months in pleasant Inns Of Aries, Taurus, and the gentle Twinns, But that the mealie Mountains (late vnseen) Change their white garments into lusty green, The Gardens prank them with their Flowry buds, The Meads with grass, with leaues the naked Woods, The Spring.Sweet Zephyrus begins to buss his Flora, Swift-winged Singers to salute Aurora; And wanton Cupid, through this Vniverse, With pleasing wounds, all Creatures hearts to perce. Summer.When, backward bent, Phlegon thy fiery Steed, With Cancer, Leo, and the Maid, doth feed; Th'Earth cracks with heat, and Summer crowns his Ceres With gilded Ears, as yellow as her hair-is: The Reaper, panting both for heat and pain, With crooked Rasor shaues the tufted Plain; And the good Husband, that due season takes, Within a Month his year's Provision makes. When from the mid-Heav'n thy bright flame doth fly Haruest.Toward the Cross-Stars in th'Antartik Sky, To be three months, vp-rising, and down-lying With Scorpio, Libra, and the Archer flying, Th'Earth by degrees her louely beauty bates, Pomona loads her lap with delicates, Her Apron and her Osiar basket (both) With dainty fruits for her deer Autumns tooth (Her health-less spouse) who bare-foot hops about To tread the iuice of Bacchus clusters out. And last of all, when thy proud-trampling Teem, For three Months more, to soiourne still doth seem With Capricorn, Aquarius, and the Fishes (While we in vain revoke thee with our wishes) In stead of Flowrs, chill shivering Winter dresses Winter. With Isicles her (self-bald) borrow'd tresses: About her brows a Periwig of Snowe, Her white Freeze mantle freng'd with Ice belowe, A payr of Lamb-lyn'd buskins on her feet, So doth she march Orythias loue to meet; Who with his bristled, hoary, bugle-beard, Comming to kiss her, makes her lips afeard; Where-at, he sighs a breath so cold and keen, That all the Waters Crystallized been; While in a fury with his boystrous wings Against the Scythian snowie Rocks he flings, All lusks in sloath: and till these Months do end, Bacchus and Vulcan must vs both befrend. O second honour of the Lamps supernall, Of the Moon &amp; her alterations. Sure Calendar of Festiuals eternall, Seas Soveraintess, Sleep-bringer, Pilgrims guide, Peace-loving Queen: what shall I say beside? What shall I say of thine inconstant brow, Which makes my brain wauer, I woat not how? But, if by th'Eye, a mans intelligence May ghess of things distant so far from hence, I think thy body round as any Ball, Of her roundnes and brightnesse borrowed of the Sunne. Whose superfice (nigh equall ouer all) As a pure Glass, now vp, and down anon, Reflects the bright beams of thy spouse, the Sun. For, as a Husbands Nobless doth illustre Simile. A mean-born wife: so doth the glorious lustre Of radiant Titan, with his beams, embright Thy gloomy Front, that selfly hath no light. Yet 'tis not alwaies after one self sort. Of her waxing &amp; waning wh? she is in her last quarter, &amp; wh? she renues and commeth to her Full. For, for thy Car doth swifter thee transport, Then doth thy Brothers, diversly thou shin'st, As more or less thou from his sight declin'st. Therefore each month, when Hymen (blest) aboue In both your bodies kindles ardent loue, And that the Stars-king all inamoured on thee, Full of desire, shines down direct vpon thee; Thy neather half-Globe toward th'Earthly Ball (After it's Nature) is observed all. But, him aside thou hast no sooner got, But on thy side a silver file we noat, A half-bent Bowe; which swels, the less thy Coach Doth the bright Chariot of thy spouse approach, And fils his Circle. When the Imperiall Star Beholds thee iust in one Diameter, Then by degrees thy Full face fals away, And (by degrees) Westward thy Horns display; Till fall'n again betwixt thy Lovers arms, Thou wink'st again, vanquisht with pleasures charms. Thus dost thou Wex and Wane, thee oft renuing; Delighting change: and mortall things, ensuing (As subiect to thee) thy selfs transmutation, Feel th'vnfelt force of secret alteration. Of the cause of the diuers aspect of the Moon.Not, but that Phœbus alwaies with his shine, Cleers half (at least) of thine aspect divine; But't seemes not so; because we see but heer Of thy round Globe the lower Hemisphear: Though wexing vs-ward, Heav'n-ward thou dost wane; And waning vs-ward, Heav'n-ward grow'st againe. Yet, it befals, even when thy face is Full, When at the highest thy pale Coursers pull, When no thick mask of Clouds can hide away, From living eyes, thy broad, round glistring Ray, Thy light is darkned, and thine eyes are feel'd, Covered with shadow of a rusty shield. For, thy Full face in his oblique designe Confronting Phœbus in th'Ecliptick line, And th'Earth between; thou losest, for a space, Thy splendor borrowd of thy Brothers grace: Of the cause of the Eclips of the Sunne.But, to reuenge thee on the Earth, for this Fore-stalling thee of thy kind Lovers kiss, Somtimes thy thick Orb thou doo'st inter-blend Twixt Sol and vs, toward the later end: And then (because his splendor cannot pass Or pearce the thickness of thy gloomy Mass) The Sun as subiect to Deaths pangs, vs sees-not, But seems all Light-less, though indeed he is not. Difference between the Eclipses of the Sun, &amp; of the Moon.Therfore, far differing your Eclipses are; For thine is often and thy Brothers rare: Thine doth indeed deface thy beauty bright; His doth not him, but vs, bereave of Light: It is the Earth, that thy defect procures; It is thy shadow, that the Sunne obscures: East-ward, thy front beginneth first to lack; West-ward, his brows begin there frowning black: Thine at thy Full, when thy most glory shines; His, in thy Wane, when beauty most declines: Thine's generall, toward Heav'n and Earth together; His, but to Earth, nor to all places neither. For, th'hideous Cloud, that cov'red so long since Of the admirable and extraordinary Eclipse of the Sun, on the Day that our Sauiour suffered on the Crosse, for our Redemption, Mat. 27. ve. 45. Mar. 15. ve. 33. Luk. 23. ve. 44.. With nights black vail th'eyes of the Starry-Prince (When as he saw, for our foul Sinfull slips, The Match-less Maker of the Light, eclipse) Was far, far other: For, the swarty Moores, That sweating toyl on Guinnes wealthy shoares: Those whom the Niles continuall Cataract With roaring noise for ever deaf doth make: Those, that survaying mighty Quinzay. Cassagale, Within the Circuit of her spacious Wall Do dry-foot dance on th'Orientall Seas; And pass, in all her goodly crossing waies And stately streets fronted with sumptuous Bowrs, Twelue thousand Bridges, and twelue thousand Towrs: Those that, in Norway and in Finland, chase The soft-skind Martens, for their precious Cace; Those that in Ivory Sleads on Ireland Seas (Congeal'd to Crystall) slide about at ease; Were witness all of his strange grief; and ghest, That God, or Nature was then deep distrest. Moreover Cynthia, in that fearfull stound, Full-fild the Compass of her Circle round; And, being so far off, she could not make (By Natures course) the Sun to be so black; Nor, issuing from the Eastern part of Heav'n, Darken that beauty, which her owne had given. In brief, mine ey, confounded with such Spectacles In that one wonder sees a Sea of Miracles. What could'st thou doo less, then thy Self dishonour (O chief of Planets!) thy great Lord to honour? Then for thy Fathers death, a-while to wear A mourning Roab on th'hatefull Hemi-sphear? Then at high noon shut thy fair eye, to shun A sight, whose sight did Hell with horror stun? And (pearc't with sorrow for such iniuries) To please thy Maker, Nature to displease? So, from the South to North to make apparant, Of the going back of the Sun in the time of Ezechias. 1. King. 26. 11 Esay 38. 8.. That God revoak't his Serieant Death's sad Warrant 'Gainst Ezechias: and that hee would giue The godly King fifteen years more to liue: Transgressing Heav'ns eternall Ordinance; Thrice in one Day, thou through one path didst prance: And, as desirous of another nap In thy vermillion sweet Aurora's Lap, Thy Coach turn'd back, and thy swift sweating Horse Full ten degrees lengthned their wonted Course: Dials went false, and Forrests (gloomy black) Wondred to see their mighty shades goe back. Of the Sunnes standing still in the time of Iosuah. Iosu. 12. 13..So, when th'incensed Heav'ns did fight so fell Vnder the Standard of deer Israel, Against the Hoast of odious Ammorites; Among a million of swift Flashing Lights, Rayning down Bullets from a stormy Cloud, As thick as Hail, vpon their Armies proud (That such as scaped from Heav'ns wrathfull thunder, Victorious swords might after heaw in-sunder) Coniur'd by Iosuah, thy braue steeds stood still, In full Career stopping thy whirling wheel; And, one whole Day, in one degree they stayd In midst of Heav'n, for sacred Armies ayd: Least th'Infidels, in their disordred Flight, Should saue themselues vnder the wings of Night. Those, that then liv'd vnder the other Pole, Seeing the Lamp which doth enlight the Whole, To hide so long his lovely face away, Thought never more to haue re-seen the Day; The wealthy Indians, and the men of Spain, Never to see Sun Rise or Set again. In the same place Shadows stood still, as stone; And in twelue Houres the Dialls shew'd but one. So Morne and Euening the Fourth Day conclude, And God perceiu'd that all his works were good. THE FIFT DAY OF THE FIRST WEEK. The Argvment. Fish in the Sea, Fowls in the Aire abound: The Forms of all things in the Waters found: The various Manners of Sea-Citizens, Whose constant Friendship far exceedeth Mens: Arions strange escape: The Fowls attend On th'onely Phœnix, to her end-less end: Their kinds, their customs, and their plumes variety; Some presidents of Prudence, som of Piety: The gratefull Eagle, burning in the Flame With her dead Mistress, the fair Sestian Dame. Latonian Lamps, conducting divers wayes, About the World, successiue Nights and Dayes; After a Poeticall manner he craueth time &amp; opportunity to discourse in this Day of the creation of Fishes &amp; of Fowle. Parents of winged Time, haste, haste your Cars: And passing swiftly both th'opposed Bars Of East, and West, by your returning Ray; Th'imperfect World make elder, by a Day. Yee Fish, that brightly in Heav'ns Baldrick shine, If you would see the Waters wauing brine Abound with Fishes, pray Hyperion T'abandon soon his liquid Mansion, If he expect, in his prefixt Career, To hoast with you a Month in every Yeer. And thou, eternall Father, at whose wink To which purpose especially he calleth on the true God. The wrathfull Ocean's swelling pride doth sink, And stubborn storms of bellowing Windes be dumb, Their wide mouthes stopt, and their wilde pinions num; Great Souerain of the Seas, whose hooks can draw A man aliue from the Whales monstrous maw, Provide me (Lord) of Steers-man, Star, and Boat, That through the vast Seas I may safely float: Or rather teach me dyue, that I may view Deep vnder water all the Scaly crew; And dropping wet, when I return to land Laden with spoyls, extoll thy mighty hand. The first part of this Book: wherin he handleth how by the Comandement of the Lord, the Fishes began to moue in the Waters. In Vain had God stor'd Heav'n with glistring studs, The Plain with grain, the Mountain tops with woods, Severd the Aire from Fire, the Earth from Water, Had he not soon peopled this large Theatre With liuing Creatures: Therefore he began (This-Day) to quicken in the Ocean, In standing Pools, and in the straggling Riuers (Whose folding Chanell fertill Champain severs) So many Fishes of so many features, That in the Waters one may see all Creatures, And all that in this All is to be found; As if the World within the Deeps were drown'd. The Seas no lesse stored with priuiledges &amp; presidents of Gods glorious power, then Heauen &amp; Earth: &amp; of the strange Fishes that liue therin.Seas haue (as well as Skies) Sun, Moon, and Stars: (As well as Aire) Swallows, and Rooks, and Stares: (As well as Earth) Vines, Roses, Nettles, Millions, Pinks, Gilliflowrs, Mushroms, and many millions Of other Plants (more rare and strange then these) As very Fishes living in the Seas: And also Rams, Calfs, Horses, Hares, and Hogs, Wolves, Lyons, Vrchins, Elephants, and Dogs, Yea Men and Mayds: and (which I more admire) The Mytred Bishop, and the Cowled Fryer: Whereof, examples (but a few yeers since) Were showen the Norways, and Polonian Prince. You divine wits of elder Dayes, from whom The deep Invention of rare Works hath com, Took you not pattern of your chiefest Tools Out of the Lap of Thetis, Lakes, and Pools? Which partly in the Waues, part on the edges Of craggy Rocks, among the ragged sedges, Bring-forth abundance of Pins, Pincers, Spoaks, Pikes, Percers, Nedles, Mallets, Pipes and Yoaks, Owers, sayls, and swords, saws, wedges, Razors, Rammers, Plumes, Cornets, Kniues, Wheels, Vices, Horns, and Hammers. And, as if Neptune, and fair Panopé, Palæmon, Triton, and Leucothoé, Kept publike Roules, there is the Calamary; Who, ready Pen-knife, Pen and Ink doth cary. Why God created so many sorts of strange Fishes.As a rare Painter draws (for pleasure) here A sweet Adonis, a foul Satyre there: Heer a huge Cyclop, there a Pigme Elf: Somtimes, no less busying his skilfull self, Vpon some vgly Monster (seldom seen) Then on the Picture of faire Beauties Queen: Even so the Lord, that, in his Work's varietie, We might the more admire his powerfull Dëitie; And that we might discern by differing features The various kinds of the vast Oceans creatures; Forming this mighty Frame, hee every Kind With diuers and peculiar Signet sign'd. Som haue their heads groveling betwixt their feet Examples. The Four-Cuttle. Cuttle. Crab. Sea-Hare. Oyster. (As th'inky Cuttles, and the Many-feet): Som in their breast (as Crabs): some head-less are, Foot-leess, and finn-less (as the bane-full Hare, And heat-full Oyster) in a heap confus'd, Their parts vnparted, in themselues diffus'd. The Tyrian Marchant, or the Portuguze Can hardly build one Ship of many Trees: Put of one Tortoise, when he list to float, The Tortoise. Th'Arabian Fisher-man can make a Boat: And one such Shell, him in the stead doth stand Of Hulk at Sea, and of a House on land. Shall I omit the monstrous Whirl-about, Which in the Sea another Sea doth spout, Where-with huge Vessels (if they happen nigh) Are over-whelm'd and sunken suddenly? Shall I omit the Tunnies, that durst meet The Tunny. Th'Eoan Monarchs never danted Fleet, And beard more brauely his victorious powrs Then the Defendants of the Tyrian Towrs; Or Porus, conquered on the Indian Coast; Or great Darius, that three Battails lost? When on the Surges I perceiue, from far, Th'Ork, Whirl-pool, Whale, or huffing Physeter, Diuers kinds of Whales. Me thinks I see the wandring Ile again (Ortygian Delos) floating on the Main. And when in Combat these fell Monsters cross, Me seems some Tempest all the Seas doth toss. Orr fear-less Saylers in far Voyages (More led by Gain's hope then their Compasses) Of their monstrous shape, &amp; huge greatness. On th'Indian shoare, haue somtime noted som Whose bodies covered two broad Acres room: And in the South-Seas they haue also seen Some like high-topped and huge-armed Treen; And other-som whose monstrous backs did bear Two mighty wheels with whirling spokes, that were Much like the winged and wide spreading sayls Of any Winde-mill turn'd with merry gales. But God (who Nature in her nature holdes) Not only cast them in so sundry moldes: Of the diuers qualities of Fishes.But gaue them manners much more differing, As well our wits as our weak eyes to bring In admiration; that men evermore, Praising his Works, might praise their Maker more. Some loue fresh Waters, some the salt desire, Some from the Sea vse yeerly to retire To the next Rivers, at their owne contenting, So both the Waters with free Trade frequenting; Having (like Lords) two Houses of receipt: For Winter th'one, th'other for Sommers heat. Simile. Describing the custome of certain Sea-Fishes, frequenting the fresh Waters in some seasons of the yeare.As Citizens, in some intestine braul, Long cooped vp within their Castle wall; So soon as Peace is made, and Siege romov'd, Forsake a while their Town so strong approv'd; And, tir'd with toyl, by leashes and by payrs, Crowned with Garlands, go to take the ayrs: So, dainty Salmons, Chevins thunder-scar'd, Feast-famous Sturgeons, Lampreys speckle-starr'd, In the Spring Season the rough Seas forsake, And in the Rivers thousand pleasures take; And yet the plenty of delicious foods, Their pleasant Lodging in the crystall floods, The fragrant sents of flowry banks about, Cannot their Country's tender loue wipe out Of their remembrance; but they needs will home, In th'irefull Ocean to go seek their Tomb: Like English Gallants, that in Youth doo go Comparison. To visit Rhine, Sein, Ister, Arn, and Po; Where though their Sense be dandled, Dayes and Nights, In sweetest choice of changeable Delights, They never can forget their Mother-Soyl, But hourly Home their hearts and eyes recoyl, Long languishing with an extream Desire To see the smoak of their deer Natiue Fire. The Fishes feeding.One (like a Pirat) only liues of prizes, That in the Deep he desperatly surprizes: Another haunts the shoar, to feed on foam: Another round about the Rocks doth roam, Nibbling on Weeds: another, hating theeving, Eats nought at all, of liquor onely living; For, the salt humour of his Element Serues him (alone) for perfect nourishment. Some loue the clear streams of swift tumbling Torrents, Which through the rocks straining their struggling currents Break Banks and Bridges; and doo never stop, Till thirsty Sommer come to drink them vp: Some almost alwayes pudder in the mud Of sleepy Pools, and never brook the flood Of Crystall streams, that in continuall motion Bend toward the bosom of their Mother Ocean: As the most part of the Worlds Peers prefer Broyls before Rest, and place their Peace in War: And some again (of a far differing humour) Holde Rest so deer, that but the onely rumour Of War far off, affrights them at the first; And wanting Peace, they count their States accurst. O watry Citizens, what Vmpeer bounded Of the prouid?ce of God in their diuers &amp; notable manner of liuing: affording many Lessons to Man-kinde. Your liquid Liuings? O! what Monarch mounded With wals your City? What severest Law Keeps your huge Armies in so certain aw, That you encroach not on the neighbouring Borders Of your swim-brethren? as (against all Orders) Men dayly practice, ioyning Land to Land, House vnto House, Sea to Sea, Strand to Strand, Mountain to Mountain, and (most-most insaci'ble) World vnto World, if they could work it possible. And you (wise Fishes) that for recreation, Or for your seeds securer propagation, Doo somtimes shift your ordinary Dwelling; What learned Chalde (skild in Fortune-telling) What cunning Prophet your sit time doth showe? What Herralds Trumpet summons you to go? What Guide conducteth, Day and Night, your Legions Through path-less paths in vnacquainted Regions? What Captain stout? what Loadston, Steel, and Star, Measures your course in your aduentures farre? Surely, the same that made you first of Nought, Who in your Nature some Ideas wrought Of Good and Evill; to the end that we, Following the Good, might from the Evill flee. Th'adulterous Sargus doth not onely change Strange nature of the fish Sargus. Wiues every day, in the deep streams; but (strange) As if the honey of Sea-loues delights Could not suffice his ranging appetites, Courting the Shee-Goats on the grassie shore, Would horn their Husbands that had horns before; Contrary to the constant Cantharus, Of Cantharus. Who, euer faithfull to his deerest Spouse In Nuptiall Duties spending all his life, Loues never other then his onely wife. But, for her Loue, the Mullet hath no Peer; Of the Mullet. For, if the Fisher haue surpriz'd her Pheer, As mad with wo to shoar she followeth, Prest to consort him both in life and death: As yerst those famous, louing Thracian Dames Simile. That leapt aliue into the funerall flames Of their dead Husbands; who deceast and gone, Those loyall Wiues hated to liue alone. O! who can heer sufficiently admire The Vrano-Scopus.That Gaping-Fish whose glistering eyes aspire Still toward Heav'n? as if beneath the skies He found no obiect worthy of his eyes. As the Wood-pecker, his long tongue doth lill Out of the clov'n-pipe of his horny bill, To catch the Emets; when, beguil'd with-all, The busie swarms about it creep and crawl: Th'Vrano-Scope, so, hid in mud, doth put Out of his gullet a long limber gut, Most like vnto a little Worm, (at sight) Where-at eft-soons many small Fishes bite: Which ther-withall this Angler swallowes straight, Alwayes self-aimed with hook, line, and bait. The suttle The Ozena. Smell-strong-Many-foot, that fain A dainty feast of Oyster-flesh would gain, Swims softly down, and to him slily slips, Wedging with stones his yet wide-yawning lips, Least else (before that he haue had his prey) The Oyster, closing clip his limbs away, And (where he thought t'haue ioy'd his victories) Himselfe become vnto his prize a prize. The Torpedo.The Cramp-fish, knowing that she harboureth A plague-full humour, a fell banefull breath, A secret Poppy, and a sense-less Winter, Benumming all that dare too-neer her venter; Pours forth her poyson, and her chilling Ice On the next Fishes; charm'd so in a trice, That she not onely stayes them in the Deep, But stuns their sense, and luls them fast a-sleep; And then (at fill) she with their flesh is fed; Whose frozen limbs (still liuing) seem but dead. 'Tis this Torpedo, that when she hath took Into her throat the sharp deceitfull hook, Doth not as other Fish, that wrench and wriggle When they be prickt, and plunge, and striue and struggle; And by their stir, thinking to scape the Angle, Faster and faster on the hook do tangle: But, wily clasping close the Fishing Line, Soddenly spews into the Silver Brine Her secret-spreading, sudden-speeding bane; Which, vp the Line, and all along the Cane, Creeps to the hand of th'Angler; who with-all Benumm' and sense-less, suddenly lets fall His hurtfull pole, and his more hatefull prize: Simile.Becomn like one that (as in bed he lies) Seems in his sleep to see som gastly Ghost; In a cold sweat, shaking, and swelt almost, He cals his wife for ayd, his friends, his folks, But his stuft stomack his weak clamour choaks: Then would he strike at that he doth behold; But sleep and feare his feeble hands doo hold: Then would he run away; but, as he strives, He feels his feet fetterd with heauy Gyues. But, if the Scolopendra haue suckt-in The Scolopendra. The sowr-sweet morsell with the barded Pin, She hath as rare a trick to rid her from it: For instantly, she all her guts doth vomit; And having clear'd them from the danger, then She fair and softly sups them in again, So that not one of them within her womb Changeth his Office or his wonted room. The thriuing Amia (neer Abydos breeding) The Amia. The Sea-Fox. And suttle Sea-Fox (in Steeds-loue exceeding) Without so vent'ring their dear life and lyning, Can from the Worm-clasp compass their vntwining: For, sucking-in more of the twisted hair, Aboue the hook they it in sunder shear; So that their foe, who for a Fish did look Lifts vp a bare line, robd of bait and hook. But timorous Barbles will not taste the bit, Till with their tails they haue vnhooked it: The Barbel. And all the baits the Fisher can deuise Cannot beguile their wary iealousies. Euen so almost, the many spotted Cuttle Wel-neer insnared, yet escapeth suttle; The Cuttle. For, when she sees her self within the Net, And no way left, but one, from thence to get, She sodainly a certaine Ink doth spew, Which dies the Waters of a sable hew; That dazling so the Fishers greedy sight, She through the Clouds of the black Waters night. Might scape with honour the black streames of Styx, Wherof already, almost lost, she licks. Simile. And, as a Prisoner, (of som great transgression, Conuict by Witness and his owne Confession) Kept in dark Durance full of noysom breath, Expecting nothing but the Day of Death; Spies euery corner, and pries round about To finde som weake place where he may get out: The delicate, cud-chewing Golden-Eye, Kept in a Weyre, the widest space doth spy, The Golden-eye or Guilt-head. And thrusting in his tail, makes th'Osiers gape With his oft flapping, and doth so escape: But, if his fellow finde him thus bested, He lends his tail to the Imprisoned; That thereby holding fast with gentle iaw, Him from his Durance, he may friendly draw. Or, (if before that he were captiuate) He see him hooked on the biting bait, Hasting to help, he leapeth at the line, And with his teeth snaps-off the hairy twine. Sundry instructions that Fishes giue to men.You stony hearts, within whose stubborn Center Could neuer touch of sacred friendship enter, Look on these Seas my Songs haue calmed thus: Heer's many a Damon, many a Theseus. The Sparlings.The gilden Sparlings, when cold Winters blast Begins to threat, themselues together cast, In heaps like balls, and heating mutually, Liue; that alone, of the keen Cold would die. Those small white Fish to Venus consecrated, Though without Venus ayd they be created Of th'Ocean scum; seeing themselues a pray Expos'd in euery Water-Rouers way, Swarming by thousands, with so many a fold Combine themselues, that their ioint strength doth hold Against the greediest of the Sea-thieues sallies; Yea, and to stay the course of swiftest Gallies. Simile.As a great Carrak, cumbred and opprest With her selfs-burthen, wends not East and West, Star-boord and Lar-boord, with so quick Careers As a small Fregat, or swift Pinnass steers: Another.And as a large and mighty limbed Steed, Either of Friseland, or of German breed, Can neuer manage half so readily, As Spanish I ennet, or light Barbarie: Of the Whale and his friend Musculus.So the huge Whale hath not so nimble motion, As smaller Fishes that frequent the Ocean; But somtimes rudely 'gainst a Rock he brushes, Or in som roaring straight he blindly rushes, And scarce could liue a Twelue-month to an end, But for the little Musculus (his friend) A little Fish; hat swimming still before, Directs him safe from Rock, from shelf and shoar: Simile.Much like a Childe that louing leads about His aged Father when his eyes be out; Still wasting him through euery way so right, That rest of eyes he seems not rest of sight. Waues-Mother Thetis, though thine arms embrace The World about, within thine ample space, Strange League betweene the Pearl-Fish and the Prawne.A firmer League of friendship is not seen Then is the Pearl-fish and the Prawn betweene; Both haue but one repast, both but one Palace, But one delight, death, sorrow, and one solace: That, lodgeth this; and this remunerates His Land-lords kindnes, with all needfull Cates. For, while the Pearl-Fish gaping wide doth glister, Much Fry (allur'd with the bright siluer Iustre Of her rich Casket) flocks into the Nacre; Then with a prick the Prawn a sign doth make-her That instantly her shining shell she close (Because the Prey worthy the pain he knowes): Which gladly done, she ev'nly shareth-out The Prey betwixt her, and her faithfull scout. And so the Sponge-Spy, warily awakes Also between the Sponge and his spy. The Gally-Fish, The Sayle-Fish, Boat Crab. Sea-Vrchin. The Sponges dull sense, when repast it takes. But O! what stile can worthily declare (O! Galley-Fish, and thou Fish-Mariner, Thou Boat-Crab, and Sea-Vrchin) your dexteritie In Saylers Art, for safeness and celeritie? If Iaffa Marchants, now Comburgers seem VVith Portugalls, and Portugalls with them: If VVorlds of Wealth, born vnder other Sky, Seem born in Ours: if without wings we fly From North to South, and from the East to West, Through hundred sundry way-less waies addrest: If (to be brief) this VVorld's rich compass round, Seem as a Common, without hedge or mound, Where (at his choice) each may him freely store With rarest fruits; You may we thank therefore. For, whether Typhis, or that Pride of Greece That styl'd to Colchos for the Golden-Fleece, Or Belus Son, first builded floating bowrs, To mate the VVindes storms, and the VVaters stowrs; What e'r he were, he surely learn'd of you The Art of Rowing and of Sayling too. Heer would I cease, saue that this humorous song The Hermit-Fish compels me to prolong. The sea-Hermit. A man of might that builds him a Defence 'Gainst VVeathers rigour and Warr's insolence, First dearly buies (for, VVhat good is good-cheap?) Both the rich Matter and rare Workmanship: But, without buying Timber, Lime, and stone, Or hiring men to build his Mansion, Or borrowing House, or paying Rent therefore, He lodgeth safe: for, finding on the shoar Some handsom shell, whose Natiue Lord, of late Was dispossessed by the Doom of Fate; Therein he enters, and he takes possession Or th'empty Harbour by the free concession Of natures Law; who Goods that Owner vvant Alwaies allots to the first Occupant. In this new Cace, or in this Cradle (rather) He spends his Youth: then, growing both together In age and Wit, he gets a wider Cell Wherein at Sea his later Daies to dwell. But Clio, wherefore art thou teadious In numbering Neptunes busie Burgers thus? If in his Works thou wilt admire the worth Of the Seas Soverain, bring but only forth One little Fish, whose admirable Story The strange and secret property of the Remora or Stop-ship.Sufficeth sole to shewe his might and glory. Let all the Windes in one Winde gather them, And (seconded with Neptunes strongest stream) Let all at once blowe all their stiffest gales A-sterna Galley vnder all her sails; Let her be holpen with a hundred Owers, Each lively handled by fiue lusty Rowers: The Remora, fixing her feeble horn Into the tempest-beaten Vessels stern, Stayes her stone-still, while all her stout Consorts Saile thence at pleasure to their wished Ports. Then loose they all the sheats, but to no boot: For, the charm'd Vessell bougeth not a foot; No more then if three fadom vnder ground, A score of Anchors held her fastly bound: No more then doth an Oak that in the Wood Hath thousand Tempests (thousand times) withstood, Spreading as many massy roots belowe, As mighty arms aboue the ground do growe. O Stop-ship say, say how thou canst oppose Thy selfe alone against so many foes. O! tell vs where thou doo'st thine Anchors hide, VVhence thou resistest Sayls, Owers, Wind, and Tide. How on the sodain canst thou curb so short A Ship whom all the Elements transport? VVhence is thine Engin, and thy secret force That frustrates Engins, and all force doth force? I had (in Harbour) heav'd mine Anchor o're, And ev'n already set one foot a-shoar; Dolphin.When lo, the Dolphin, beating 'gainst the bank, 'Gan mine obliuion moodily mis-thank. Peace, Princely Swimmer: sacred Fish, content thee; For, for thy praise, th'end of this Song I meant-thee. Braue Admirall of the broad briny Regions, Triumphant Tamer of the scaly Legions, VVho liuing, ever liv'st (for, neuer sleep, Deaths liuely Image, in thy eyes doth creep) Lover of Ships, of Men, of Melody, Thou vp and down through the moyst World doost ply Swift as a shaft; whose Salt thou louest so, That lacking that, thy life thou doest forgo: Thou (gentle Fish) wert th'happy Boat, of yore Which safely brought th'Amiclean Harp a-shoar. Arion, match-less for his Musiks skill, The strange aduenture of Ari? saued by a Dolphin. Among the Latines hauing gain'd his fill Of gold and glory, and exceeding fain To re-salute his learned Greece again; Vnwares, imbarks him in a Pyrates ship: Who, loath to let so good a Booty slip, Soon waighes his Anchors, packs on all his sail; And Windes conspiring with a prosperous gale, His winged Fregat made so speedy flight, Tarentum Towers were quickly out of sight; And all, saue Skies, and Seas, on euery side; VVhere, th'onely Compass is the Pylots guide. The Saylours then (whom many times we finde Falser then Seas, and fiercer then the VVinde) Fall straight to strip him, ryfling (at their pleasure) In every corner to find out his treasure: And, hauing found it, all with one accord Hoist th'Owner vp, to heaue him ouer-boord. Who weeping said. O Nereus noble issue, Not, to restore my little gold, I wish you: For, my chiefe Treasure in my Musick lyes (And all Apollo's sacred Pupils, prize The holy Virgins of Parnassus so, That vnder-foot all worldly wealth they throwe.) No (braue Triumphers ouer VVinde and VVaue, VVho in both VVorlds your habitation haue, VVho both Heav'ns Hooks in your adventures view) 'Tis not for That, with broken sighes I sue: I but beseech you, offer no impieties Vnto a person deer vnto the Deities. So may Messenian Sirens, for your sake, Be euer mute when you your voyage make, And Tritons Trumpet th'angry Surges swage, When (iustly) Neptune shall against you rage. But if (alas!) I cannot this obtaine (As my faint eye reads in your frowns too plaine) Suffer, at least, to my sad dying voice, My dolefull fingers to consort their noise: That so the Sea Nymphs (rapt in admiration Of my diuine, sweet, sacred lamentation) Dragging my corps to shoar, with weeping showrs May deaw the same, and it entoomb in flowrs. Then play (said they) and giue vs both togither Treasure and pleasure by thy comming hither. His sweetest strokes then sad Arion lent Th'inchanting sinnews of his Instrument: Wherewith he charm'd the raging Ocean so, That crook-tooth'd Lampreys, and the Congers rowe Friendly together, and their natiue hate The Pike and Mullet (for the time) forgate, And Lobstars floated fear-less all the while Among the Polyps, prone to theft and guile. But among all the Fishes that did throng To daunce the Measures of his Mournefull song, There was a Dolphin did the best accord His nimble Motions to the trembling Chord: Who gently sliding neer the Pinnass side, Seem'd to inuite him on his back to ride. By this time, twice the Saylours had essayd To heaue him o're; yet twice himselfe he staied: And now the third time stroue they him to cast; Yet by the shrowds the third time held he fast: But lastly, seeing Pyrats past remorse, And him too-feeble to withstand their force, The trembling Dolphins shoulders he bestrid; Who on the Oceans azure surges slid; So, that far-off (his charge so cheered him) One would haue thought him rather fly, then swim: Yet feares he every Shelfe and euery Surge (Not for himselfe, but for his tender charge) And, sloaping swiftly overthwart those Seas (Not for his owne but for his Riders ease) Makes double haste to find some happy strand, Where his sweet Phœbus he may safely land. Mean-while, Arion, with his Musick rare, Paies his deer Pylot his delightfull Fare. And heaving eyes to Heav'n, the Hav'n of Pity) To his sweet Harp he tunes this sacred Ditty; O thou Almightie! who Mankind to wrack, Of thousand Seas, didst whilom one Sea make, And yet didst saue, from th'vniuersall Doom, One sacred Houshold, that in time to com (From Age to Age) should sing thy glorious praise; Looke down (O Lord) from thy supernall rayes; Look, look (alas!) vpon a wretched man, Halfe Toomb'd already in the Ocean: O! bee my Steers-man, and vouchsafe to guide The stern-less Boat, and bit-less Horse I ride; So that, escaping Windes and VVaters wrath, I once againe may tread my natiue path: And hence-forth, heer with solemn vowes I sacre Vnto thy glory (O my God and Maker) For this great fauour's high Memoriall, My Heart and Art, my voyce, hand, Harp, and all. Here-with, the Seas their roaring rage refrain, The Clowdy Welkin waxed cleer again, And all the Windes did sodainly conuert Their mouths to ears, to heare his wondrous Art. The Dolphin then, discrying Land (at last) Stormes with himselfe, for hauing made such haste, And witht Laconia thousand Leagues from thence, T'haue ioy'd the while his Musicks excellence. But, 'fore his owne delight, preferring far Th'vnhoped safety of the Minstrell rare, Sets him ashoare, and (which most strange may seem) Where life he took, there life restoreth him. But now (deere Muse) with Ionas let vs hie From the Whales belly; and from ieopardy Of stormfull Seas, of wrackfull Rocks and Sand, Com, com (my Darling) let vs haste to Land. While busie, poaring downward in the Deep. The second part of this book, treating of Fowles. I sing of Fishes (that there Quarter keep) See how the Fowles are from my fancy fled, And their high prayses quight out of my head: Their flight out-flies me; and my Muse almost The better halfe of this bright Day hath lost. But, cheer ye, Birds: your shadows (as ye pass) Seeming to flutter on the Waters face, Make me remember, by their nimble turns, Both what my duty, and your due concerns. But first I pray (for meed of all my toyl In bringing you into this Happie Ile) Vouchsafe to waken with your various Notes The sense-less senses of those drowsie Sots, Whose eye-lids laden with a waight of Lead Shall fall a-sleep the while these Rymes are read. But, if they could not close their wakefull eyes Among the Water's silent Colonies; How can they sleep among the Birds, whose sound Through Heav'n and Earth and Ocean doth redound? The Heav'nly Phœnix first began to frame Of the admirable and Onely Phœnix. The earthly Phœnix, and adorn'd the same With such a plume, that Phœbus, circuiting From Fez to Cairo, sees no fairer thing: Such form, such feathers, and such Fate he gaue-her, That fruitfull Nature breedeth nothing braver: Two sparkling eyes; vpon her crown, a crest Of starrie Sprigs (more splendent then the rest) A goulden doun about her dainty neck, Her description.Her brest deep purple, and a scarlet back, Her wings and train of feathers (mixed fine) Of orient azure and incarnadine. He did appoint her Fate to be her Pheer, And Deaths cold kisses to restore her heer Her life.Her life again, which neuer shall expire Vntill (as she) the World consume in fire. For, hauing passed vnder diuers Climes, A thousand Winters, and a thousand Primes; Worn-out with yeers, wishing her endless end, To shining flames she doth her life commend, Dies to reuiue, and goes into her Graue To rise againe more beautifull and braue. Perched, therfore, vpon a branch of Palm, With Incense, Cassia, Spiknard, Myrrh, and Balm, By break of Day shee builds (in narrow room) Her Vrn, her Nest, her Cradle, and her Toomb: VVhere, while she sits all gladly-sad expecting Som flame (against her fragrant heap reflecting.) To burn her sacred bones to seedfull cinders Her death.(Wherein, her age, but not her life, she renders) The Phrygian Skinker with his lauish Ewer, Drowns not the Fields with shower after showr; The shivering Coach man with his Icy Snowe Dares not the Forrests of Phœnicia strowe: Auster presumes not Libyan shoars to pass VVith his moist wings: and gray-beard Boreas (As the most boistrous and rebellious slaue) Is prisoned close in th'Hyper-Borean Caue: For, Nature now propitious to her End, To her liuing Death a helping hand doth lend: And stopping all those Mouths, doth mildly sted Her Funeralls, her fruitfull birth, and bed: And Sol himself, glancing his goulden eyes On th'odoriferous Couch wherein she lies, Kindles the spice, and by degrees consumes Th'immortall Phœnix, both her flesh and plumes. Her re-generation.But instantly out of her ashes springs A Worm, an Egg then, then a Bird with wings, Iust like the first (rather the same indeed) Which (re-ingendred of it's selfly seed) By noblely dying a new Date begins, And where she loseth, there her life she wins: End-less by'r End, eternall by her Toomb; While, by a prosperous Death, she doth becom (Among the cinders of her sacred Fire) Her own selfs Heir, Nurse, Nurseling, Dam, and Sire: Teaching vs all, in Adam heer to dy, The best application. That we in Christ may liue eternally. The Phœnix, cutting th'vnfrequented Aire, Birds that follow the Phœnix, and their natures. Forth-with is followed by a thousand pair Of wings in th'instant by th'Almighty wrought, VVith diuers Size, Colour, and Motion fraught. The sent-strong Swallow sweepeth to and fro, As swift as shefts fly from a Turkish Bowe, The Swallow. When (vse and Art, and strength confedered) The skilfull Archer draws them to the head: Flying she sings, and singing seeketh where She more with cunning, then with cost, may rear Her round-front Palace in a place secure, Whose Plot may serue in rarest Arch'tecture: Her little beak she loads with brittle straws, Her wings with Water, and with Earth her claws, Whereof she Morter makes, and there-with-all Aptly she builds her semi-circle Wall. The pretty Lark, climbing the VVelkin cleer, The Lark. Chaunts with a cheer, Heer peer-I neer my Deer; Then stooping thence (seeming her fall to rew) Adieu (she saith) adieu, deer Deer, adieu. The Spink, the Linot, and the Gold Finch fill The Linot. The Finch. All the fresh Aire with their sweet warbles shrill. But, These are nothing to the Nightingale, The Nightingale. Breathing, so sweetly from a breast so small, So many Tunes whose Harmony excels Our Voice, our Violls, and all Musick els. Good Lord! how oft in a green Oken Grove, In the cool shadow haue I stood and strove To marry mine immortall Layes to theirs, Rapt with delight of their delicious Aiers! And (yet) me thinks, in a thick thorn I hear A Nightingale to warble sweetly, cleer. One while she bears the Base, anon the Tenor, Anon the Trebble, then the Counter-Tenor: Then all at once; (as it were) chalenging The rarest voices with her self to sing. Thence thirty steps, amid the leafie Sprayes, Another Nightingale repeats her Layes, Iust Note for Note, and adds som Strain at last, That she hath conned all the VVinter past: The first replyes, and descants there-vpon; With divine warbles of Division, Redoubling Quauers; And so (turn by turn) Alternatly they sing away the Morn: So that the conquest in this curious strife. Doth often cost the one her voyce and life: Then, the glad Victor all the rest admire, And after count her Mistress of the Quire. At break of Day, in a Delicious song She sets the Gam-vt to a hundred yong: And, when as fit for higher Tunes she sees them, Then learnedly she harder Lessons giues-them; VVhich, strain by strain, they studiously recite, And follow all their Mistress Rules aright. Diuers other delicate, and gentle Birds.The Colchian Pheasant, and the Partridge rare, The lustfull Sparrow, and the fruitfull Stare, The chattering Pye, the chastest Turtle-Doue, The grizel Quoist, the Thrush (that Grapes doth love) The little Gnat-snap (worthy Princes Boords) And the greene Parrat, fainer of our words, Wait on the Phœnix, and admire her tunes, And gaze themselues in her blew golden plumes. The ravening Kite, whose train doth well supply Rauenous Birds.A Rudders place, the Falcon mounting high, The Marlin, Lanar, and the gentle-Tercell, Th'Ospray, and Saker, with a nimble sarcell Follow the Phœnix, from the Clouds (almost) At once discovering many an vnknow'n Coast. In the swift Rank of these fell Rovers, flies The Indian Griffin with the glistring eyes, Beak Eagle-like, back sable, sanguin brest, VVhite (Swan-like) wings, fierce talons, alwaies prest For bloody battails; for, with these he tears Boars, Lions, Horses, Tigres, Bulls, and Bears: VVith these, our Grandams fruitfull panch he pulls, VVhence many an Ingot of pure Gold he culls, To floor his proud nest, builded strong and steep On a high Rock, better his thefts to keep: VVith these, he guards against an Army bold The hollow Mines where first he findeth Gold; As wroth, that men vpon his right should rove, Or theevish hands vsurp his Tresor-troue. Detestation of Auarice, for her execrable &amp; d?gerous effects.O! ever may'st thou fight so (valiant Foul) For this dire bane of our seduced soule: And (with thee) may the Dardan Ants so ward The Gold committed to their carefull Guard, That hence-forth hopeless, mans frail mind may rest-her From seeking that, which doth it's Masters master. O odious poyson! for the which we dive To Pluto's dark Den: for the which we rive Our Mother Earth; and, not contented with Th'abundant gifts she outward offereth, VVith sacrilegious Tools we rudely rend-her, And ransack deeply in her bosom tender, While vnder ground wee liue in hourly fear When the frail Mines shall over-whelm vs there: For which, beyond rich Taproban, we roule Through thousand Seas to seek another Pole; And, maugre Windes and Waters enmity, We every Day new vnknow'n VVorlds descry: For which (alas!) the brother sels his brother, The Sire his Son, the Son his Sire and Mother, The Man his Wife, the Wife her wedded Pheer, The Friend his Friend: O! what not sell wee heer, Sithence to satiat our Gold-thirsty gall, We sell our selues, our very soules and all? Neer these, the Crowe his greedy wings displayes, The long-liv'd Rav'n, th'infamous Bird that layes Night-Fowles and solitary Birds. His bastard Egges within the nests of other, To have them hatcht by an vnkindely Mother: The Skrich-Owle, vs'd in falling Towres to lodge, Th'vnlucky Night-Rav'n, and thou lasie Madge That fearing light, still seekest where to hide The hate and scorn of all the Birds beside. But (gentle Muse) tell me what Fowls are those Water fowles. That but even-now from flaggy Fenns arose? Tis th'hungry Hern, the greedy Cormorant, The Coot and Curlew, which the moors doo haunt, The nimble Teal, the Mallard strong in flight, The Di-dapper, the Plover and the Snight: The silver Swan, that dying singeth best, And the Kings-Fisher; which so builds her nest By the Sea-side in midst of Winter Season, That man (in whom shines the bright Lamp of Reason) Cannot devise, with all the wit he ha's, Her little building how to raise or raze: So long as there her quiet Couch she keeps, Sicilian Sea exceeding calmly sleeps; For, Æolus, fearing to drown her brood, Keeps home the while, and troubles not the Flood. The Pirat (dwelling alwayes in his Bark) In's Calendar her building Dayes doth mark: And the rich Marchant resolutely venters, So soon as th'Halcyon in her brood-bed enters. Mean-while, the Langa, skimming (as it were) The Oceans surface, seeketh every where The hugy VVhale; where slipping-in (by Art) In his vast mouth, shee feeds vpon his hart. Nevv-Spain's Cucuio, in his forhead brings Strange admirable Birds. Two burning Lamps, two vnderneath his wings: Whose shining Rayes serue oft, in darkest night, Th'Imbroderer's hand in royall VVorks to light: Th'ingenious Turner, with a wakefull eye, To polish fair his purest Ivory: The Vsurer, to count his glistring treasures: The learned Scribe to limn his golden measures. But note we now, towards the rich Moluques, Those passing strange and wondrous (birds) With vs cald Birds of Paradise. Mamuques (VVond'rous indeed, if Sea, or Earth, or Sky, Saw ever wonder, swim, or goe, or fly) None knowes their nest, none knowes the dam that breeds them: Food-less they liue; for, th'Aire alonely feeds them: VVing-less they fly; and yet their flight extends, Till with their flight, their vnknow'n lives-date ends. Charitable Birds.The Stork, still eying her deer Thessalie, The Pelican consorteth cheerfully: Prayse-worthy Payer; which pure examples yield Of faithfull Father, and officious Childe: Th'one quites (in time) her Parents love exceeding, From whom shee had her birth and tender breeding; Not onely brooding vnder her warm brest Their age-chill'd bodies bed-rid in the nest; Nor only bearing them vpon her back Through th'empty Aire, when their own wings they lack; But also, sparing (This let Children note) Her daintiest food from her own hungry throat, To feed at home her feeble Parents, held From forraging, with heavy Gyves of Eld. The other, kindly, for her tender Brood Tears her own bowells, trilleth-out her blood To heal her young, and in a wondrous sort Vnto her Children doth her life transport: For finding them by som fell Serpent slain, She rents her brest, and doth vpon them rain Her vitall humour; whence recouering heat, They by her death, another life do get: A Type of Christ, who, sin-thrall'd man to free, Became a Captive; and on shamefull Tree (Self-guiltless) shed his blood, by's wounds to save-vs, And salue the wounds th'old Serpent firstly gave-vs: And so became, of meer immortall, mortall; Therby to make frail mortall Man, immortall. Lessons for mankinde, out of the consideration of the natures of diuers creatures.Thus doo'st thou print (O Parent of this All) In every brest of brutest Animall A kind Instinct, which makes them dread no less Their Childrens danger, then their owne decease; That so, each Kinde may last immortally, Though th'Indiuiduum pass successively. So fights a Lion, not for glory (then) But for his Deer Whelps taken from his Den By Hunters fell: He fiercely roareth out, He wounds, he kils; amid the thickest rout, He rushes-in, dread-less of Spears, and darts, Swords, shafts, and staues, though hurt in thousand parts; And, brave-resolved, till his last breath lack, Never gives-over, nor an inch gives-back: Wrath salves his wounds: and lastly (to conclude) When, over-layd with might and Multitude, He needs must dy; dying, he more bemoanes, Then his owne death, his Captiue little-Ones. So, for their yong our Masty Currs will fight, Eagerly bark, bristle their backs, and bite. So, in the Deep, the Dog-Fish for her Fry Lucina's throes a thousand times doth try: For, seeeing when the suttle Fisher followes them, Again alive into her womb shee swallows them; And when the perill's past, she brings them thence, As from the Cabins of a safe defence; And (thousand liues to their deer Parent owing) As sound as ever in the Seas are rowing. So doth a Hen make of her wings a Targe To shield her Chickens that she hath in charge: And so, the Sparrow with her angry bill Defends her brood from such as would them ill. I hear the Crane (if I mistake not) cry; Who in the Clouds forming the forked Y, The Crane. Y. By the braue orders practiz'd vnder her, Instructeth souldiers in the Art of War. For when her Troops of wandring Cranes forsake Frost-firmed Strymon, and (in Autumn) take Truce with the Northren Dwarfs, to seek adventure In Southren Climates for a milder Winter; Afront each Band a forward Captain flies, Whose pointed Bill cuts passage through the skies; Two skilfull Sergeants keep the Ranks aright, And with their voyce hasten their tardy Flight; And when the honey of care-charming sleep Sweetly begins through all their veins to creep, One keeps the Watch, and ever carefull-most, Walks many a Round about the sleeping Hoast, Still holding in his claw a stony clod, Whose fall may wake him if he hap to nod. Another doth as much, a third, a fourth, Vntill, by turns, the Night be turned forth. There, the fair Peacock beautifully braue, The Peacock. Proud, portly-strouting, stalking, stately-graue, Wheeling his starry Trayn, in pomp displayes His glorious eyes to Phœbus golden rayes. The Cock.Close by his side stands the courageous Cock, Crest-peoples King, the Peasants trusty Clock, True Morning Watch, Aurora's Trumpeter, The Lyons terror, true Astronomer, Who daily riseth when the Sun doth rise; And when Sol setteth, then to roost he hies. There, I perceiue amid the flowry Plain The Estrige.The mighty Estridge, striving oft in vain To mount among the flying multitude (Although with feathers, not with flight indu'd): Whose greedy stomach steely gads digests; Whose crisped train adorns triumphant crests. Thou happy Witness of my happy Watches, Blush not (my Book) nor think it thee dismatches, Of Insects: in the Creation wherof the wisedom of their Maker shineth admirably.To bear about vpon thy paper-Tables, Flies, Butterflies, Gnats, Bees, and all the rabbles Of other Insects (end-less to rehearse) Limn'd with the pencill of my various Verse; Sith These are also His wife Workmanships Whose fame did never obscure Work eclipse: And sith in These he shows vs every howr More wondrous proofs of his Almighty powr Then in huge Whales, or hideous Elephants, Or whatsoever other Monster haunts In storm-less Seas, raising a storm about, While in the Sea another Sea they spout. For, if olde Times admire Callicrates For Ivory Emmets; and Mermècides For framing of a rigged Ship, so small That with her wings a Bee can hide it all (Though th'Artfull fruits of all their curious pain, Fit for no vse, were but inuentions vain) Admire we then th'all-wise Omnipotence, Which doth within so narrow space dispence Of Flyes.So stiff a sting, so stout and valiant heart, So loud a voyce, so prudent wit and Art. For, where's the State beneath the Firmament, Of Bees.That doth excell the Bees for Government? No, no: bright Phœbus, whose eternall Race Once every Day about the World doth pase, Sees heer no Citie, that in Rites and Laws (For Equitie) neer to their Iustice draws: Not Voice. That which flying from the furious Hun, In th'Adrian-Sea another World begun. Their well-rul'd State my soule so much admires, That, durst I loose the Rains of my desires, I gladly could digress from my designe, To sing a while their sacred Discipline: But if, of all, whose skilfull Pencils dare To counterfait th'Almightie's Models rare, None yet durst finish that fair Peece, wherein Learned Apelles drew Loue's wanton Queen; Shall I presume Hymetus Mount to climbe, And sing the Bees praise in mine humble rime? Which Latian Bards inimitable Prince Hath warbled twice about the banks of Mince? Yet may I not that little The Silk-worm. Worm pass-by, Of Fly turn'd Worm, and of a Worm a Fly: Two births, two deaths, heer Nature hath assign'd-her, Leaving a Post-hume (dead-liue) seed behinde-her, Which soon transforms the fresh and tender leaues Of Thisbes pale Tree, to those slender sleaues (On ovall clews) of soft, smooth, Silken slakes Which more for vs, then for her self, she makes. O precious fleece! which onely did adorn The sacred loyns of Princes heertoforn: But our proud Age, with prodigall abuse, Hath so profan'd th'old honourable vse, That shifters now, who scarce haue bread to eat, Disdain plain Silk, vnless it be beset With one of those deer Metals, whose desire Burns greedy soules with an immortall fire. Though last, not least; braue Eagle, no contempt Made me so long thy story hence exempt (Nor LESS-EX told shall thy true vertues be, For th'Eyrie's sake that ownes my Muse and mee; There Iov's and Iuno's stately Birds be billing, Their azure Field with fairest Eaglets filling (Azure they bear three Eaglets Argentine, A Cheuron Ermin grailed Or between). WItt, CHieftie, RICHess, to THem all I Wish In earth; in Heav'n th'immortall Crown of Bliss.) For, well I knowe, thou holdest (worthily) That place among the Aëry flocks that fly, As doth the Dragon, or the Cocatrice Among the banefull Creeping Companies: The noble Lion among savage beasts: And gentle Dolphin 'mong the Dyuing guests. I knowe thy course; I know, thy constant sight Can fixly gaze against Heav'ns greatest Light. But, as the Phœnix on my Front doth glister, Thou shalt the Finials of my Frame illustre. On Thracian shoar of the same stormy stream, A strange and notable story of the loue and death of an Eagle. Which did inherit both the bones and name Of Phryxus Sister (and not far from thence Where loue-blind Heros hap-less diligence, In steed of Loves lamp, lighted Deaths cold brand, To waft Leanders naked limbs to land) There dwelt a Maid, as noble, and as rich, As faire as Hero, but more chaste by much: For, her steel brest still blunted all the Darts Of Paphos Archer, and eschew'd his Arts. One day, this Damsell through a Forrest thick Hunting among her Friends (that sport did seek) Vnto a steep Rocks thorny-thrummed top (Where, one (almost) would fear to clamber vp) Two tender Eaglets in a nest espies, Which 'gainst the Sun sate trying of their eyes; Whose callow backs and bodies round about With soft short quils began to bristle out; Who yawning wide, with empty gorge did gape For wonted fees out of their Parents rape. Of these two Fowls the fairest vp she takes Into her bosom, and great haste she makes Down from the Rock, and shiuering yet for fear Trips home as fast as her light feet can bear: Even as a Wolf, that hunting for a pray, And having stoln (at last) some Lamb away; Flyes with down-hanging head, and leereth back Whether the Mastife doo pursue his track. In time, this Eagle was so throughly mann'd, That from the Quarry, to her Mistress hand At the first call 't would come; and faun vpon-her, And bill and bow, in signe of loue and honour: On th'other side, the Maiden makes as much Of her deer Bird; stroking with gentle touch Her wings and train, and with a wanton voyce It wantonly doth cherish and reioyce: And (prety-fondling) she doth prize it higher Then her owne beauties; which all else admire. But (as fell Fates mingle our single ioyes, With bitter gall of infinite annoyes) An extream Fever vext the Virgins bones (By one disease to cause two deaths at once) Consum'd her flesh, and wanly did displace The Rose-mixt-Lillies in her louely face. Then far'd the Foul and Fairest both a-like; Both like tormented, both like shivering sick; So that, to note their passions, one would gather That Lachesis spun both their liues together. But oft the Eagle, striving with her Fit, Would fly abroad to seek som dainty bit, For her deer Mistress: and with nimble wing, Som Rail, or Quail, or Partridge would she bring; Paying with food, the food receiv'd so oft, From those fair Ivory, Virgin-fingers soft, During her nonage, yer she durst essay To cleaue the sky, and for her selfe to prey. The Fever now with spitefull fits had spent The blood and marrow of this Innocent, And Life resign'd to cruell Death her right; Who three dayes after doth the Eagle cite. The fearfull Hare durst now frequent the Down; And round about the Wals of Hero's Town, The Tercel-gentle, and swift Falcon flew, Dread-less of the Eagle that so well they knew: For she (alas!) lies on her Ladies bed, Still-sadly mourning; though a-liue, yet dead: For, O! how should she liue, sith Fatall knife Hath cut the thread of her liues deerest life? O're the deer Corps somtimes her wings she hovers, Somtimes the dead brest with her brest she covers, Somtimes her neck doth the pale neck embrace, Somtimes she kisses the cold lips and face; And with sad murmurs she lamenteth so, That her strange moan augments the Parents wo. Thrice had bright Phœbus daily Chariot run Past the proud Pillars of Alcmænas son, Since the fair Virgin past the fatall Ferry Where (lastly) Mortals leaue their burthens weary; And yet this dolefull Bird, drown'd in her tears, All comfort-less, Rest and Repast forbears: So much (alas!) she seemeth to contend, Her life and sorrows both at once to end. But lastly, finding all these means too-weak, The quick dispatch, that she did wish, to wreak; With ire and anguish both at once enraged, Vnnaturally her proper brest she gaged, And tears her bowels, storming bitterly That all these deaths could yet not make her dy. But, lo the while, about the lightsom door Of th'hap-less house, a mournfull troop, that bore Black on their back, and Tapers in their fists, Tears on their cheeks, and sorrow in their brests; Who, taking vp the sacred Load (at last) Whose happy soule already Heav'n embrac't; With shrill, sad cries, march toward the fatall Pile With solemn pase: The silly Bird, the while, Following far-off, her bloody entrails trails; Honouring, with convoy, two sad Funerals. No sooner had the Ceremonious Flame Embrac't the Body of her tender Dame, But suddenly, distilling all with blood, Down soust the Eagle on the blazing wood: Nor boots the Flamine, with his sacred wand, A hundred times to beat her from her stand: For, to the midst still of the Pile the plies; And, singing sweet her Ladies Obsequies, There burns her selfe, and blendeth happily Her bones with hers she lov'd so tenderly. O happy Pair! vpon your sable Toomb, May Mel and Manna ever showring come; May sweetest Myrtles ever shade your Herse, And evermore liue you within my Verse. So Morne and Euening the Fift Day conclude, And God perceiu'd that all his works were good. THE SIXT DAY OF THE FIRST WEEK. The Argvment. Inuiting all which through this world, aspire Vnto the next, God's glorious Works t'admire; Heer, on the Stage, our noble Poet brings Beasts of the Earth, Cattell, and creeping things: Their hurt and help to vs: The strange euents Between Androdus, and the Forrest Prince. The little-World (Commander of the greater) Why formed last: his admirable Feature: His Heav'n-born Soule; her wondrous operation: His deerest Rib: All Creatures generation. You Pilgrims, which (through this worlds Citie) wend An exhortation to all which through the Pilgrimage of this life, tend toward the euerlasting Citie, to consider well the excellent works of God, been represented by our Poet. Toward th' happy Citie, where withouten end True ioyes abound; to anchor in the Port Where Deaths pale horrors never do resort? If you will see the fair Amphitheaters, Th'Arks, Arcenals, Towrs, Temples, and Theaters, Colosses, Cirques, Pyles, Ports, and Palaces Proudly dispersed in your Passages; Com, com with me: for, there's not any part In this great Frame where shineth any Art, But I will show't you. Are you weary, since? What! tyr'd so soon? Why, will you not (my friends) Having already ventur'd forth so far On Neptun's back (through Windes and Waters war) Rowe yet a stroak, the Harbour to recover, Whose shoars already my glad eyes discover? Almighty Father, guide their Guide along, And pour vpon my faint vnfluent tongue The sweetest hony of th'Hyanthian Fount, Which freshly purleth from the Muses Mount. With the sweet charm of my Victorious Verse, Tame furious Lions, Bears, and Tigers fierce; Make all the wilde Beasts, laying fury by, To com with Homage to my Harmony. The Elephant. Of All The Beasts which thou This-Day didst build, To haunt the Hils, the Forrest, and the Field, I see (as vice-Roy of their brutish Band) The Elephant The Vant-gard doth command: Worthy that Office; whether we regard His Towred back, where many Souldiers ward; Or else his Prudence, wherewithall he seems T'obscure the wits of human-kinde somtimes: As studious Scholar, he self-rumineth His lessons giv'n, his King he honoureth, Adores the Moon: moved with strange desire, He feels the sweet flames of the Idalian fire, And (pearc't with glance of a kinde-cruell ey) For humane beauty, seems to sigh and dy. Yea (if the Græcians doo not mis-recite) With's crooked trumpet he doth somtimes write. His combat with the Rhinocerot.But, his huge strength, nor subtle wit, cannot Defend him from the sly Rhinocerot: Who never, with blinde fury led, doth venter Vpon his Fo, but (yer the Lists he enter) Against a Rock he whetteth round about The dangerous pike vpon his armed snout: Then buckling close, doth not (at randon) hack On the hard Cuirass on his Enemies back; But vnder's belly (cunning) findes a skin, Where (and but there) his sharpned blade will in. The scaly Dragon, beeing else too lowe For th'Elepant, vp a thick Tree doth goe; So, closely ambusht almost every Day, To watch the Carry-Castle, in his way: Who, once approaching, straight his stand he leaues, And round about him he so closely cleaues With's wrything body; that his Enemy His combat with the Dragon.(His stinging knots vnable to vn-ty) Hastes to som Tree, or to som Rock, whereon To rush and rub-off his detested zone, The fell embraces of whose dismall clasp Haue almost brought him to his latest gasp. Then, suddenly, the Dragon slips his hold From th'Elephant, and sliding down, doth fold About his fore-legs, fetter'd in such order, The true Image of Ciuill War. That stocked there, he now can stir no furder; While th'Elephant (but to no purpose) strives With's winding Trunk t'vndoo his wounding gyves, His furious fo thrusts, in his nose, his nose; Then head and all; and there-withall doth close His breathing passage: but, his victory He ioyes not long; for his huge Enemy, Falling down dead, doth with his waighty Fall Crush him to death, that caus'd his death, withall: Like factious French-men, whose fell hands pursue Simile. In their owne brests their furious blades t'embrew, While pitty-less, hurried with blinded zeal, In her owne blood they bathe their Common-weal; When as at Dreux S. Denis, and Mountcounter, Their parricidiall bloody swords encounter; Making their Countrey (as a Tragick Tomb) T'enter th'Earth's terror in her hap-less womb. Or, like our own (late) York and Lancaster, Sunne. Ambitious broachers of that Viper-War, Which did the womb of their own Dam deuour, And spoil'd the freshest of fair England's Flowr; When (White and Red) Rose against Rose, they stood, Brother 'gainst Brother, to the knees in blood: While Wakefield, Barnet and S. Alban's streets Were drunk with deer blood of Plantagenets: Where, either Conquer'd, and yet neither won; Sith, by them both, was but their Owne vndon. Neer th'Elephant, comes th'horned. Alias Gyraffa, alias Anabula: an Indian Sheep, or a wilde Sheep. Hirable, Stream-troubling Camell, and strong-necked Bull, The lazy-pased (yet laborious) Asse, The quick, proud Courser, which the rest doth passe For apt address; Mars and his Master loving, After his hand with ready lightness moving: This, out of hand, will self advance, and bound, Corvet, pase, manage, turn, and trot the Round: That, followes loose behinde the Groom that keeps-him; This, kneeleth down the while his Master leaps-him: This, runs on Corn-Ears, and ne'r bends their quils; That, on the Water, and ne'r wets his heels. In a fresh Troup, the fearfull Hare I note, The Hare. Th'oblivious Conney, and the brouzing Goat, The Conny. Goat. The sloathfull Swine, the golden-fleeced Sheep, Sheep. Swine. The light-foot Hart, which every yeer doth weep (As a sad Recluse) for his branched head, Deere. That in the Spring-time he before hath shed. O! what a sport, to see a Heard of them Take soyl in Sommer in som spacious stream! One swims before: another on his chine, Nigh half-vpright, doth with his brest incline; On that, another; and so all doe ride Each after other: and still, when their guide Growes to be weary, and can lead no more, He that was hindmost coms and swims before: Like as in Cities, still one Magistrate Bears not the Burthen of the common State; But having past his Yeer, he doth discharge On others shoulders his sweet-bitter Charge. But, of all Beasts, none steadeth man so much As doth the Dog; his diligence is such: A faithfull Guard, a watchfull Sentinell, A painfull Purvayor, that with perfect smell Provides great Princes many a dainty mess, A friend till death, a helper in distress, Dread of the Wolf, Feare of the fearfull Thief, Fierce Combatant, and of all Hunters chief. Squirrill.There skips the Squirrill, seeming Weather-wise, Without beholding of Heav'ns twinkling eyes: For, knowing well which way the winde will change, Hee shifts the portall of his little Grange. Weazell. Fox.There's th'wanton Weazell, and the wily Fox, Monkey.The witty Monkey, that mans action mocks: Ciuit Cat.The sweat-sweet Ciuit, deerly fetcht from far For Courtiers nice, past Indian Tarnassar. Beuer, or Bezar.There, the wise Beuer, who, pursu'd by foes, Tears-off his codlings, and among them throwes; Knowing that Hunters on the Pontik Heath Doo more desire that ransom, then his death. Hedge-hog.There, the rough Hedg-hog; who, to shun his thrall, Shrinks vp himselfe as round as any Ball; And fastning his slowe feet vnder his chin, On's thistly bristles rowles him quickly in. But th'Ey of Heav'n beholdeth nought more strange Chameleon.Then the Chameleon, who with various change Receiues the colour that each obiect giues, And (food-less else) of th'Aire alonely liues. My blood congeales, my sudden swelling brest Can hardly breath, with chill cold cakes opprest; My hair doth stare, my bones for fear do quake, My colour changes, my sad heart doth shake: And, round about, Deaths Image (ghastly-grim) Before mine eyes all-ready seems to swim. O! who is he that would not be astound, To be (as I am) heer environ'd round, Creatures venomous, &amp; offensiue to man.With cruell'st Creatures, which for Mastery, Haue vow'd against vs end-less Enmity? Phœbus would faint, Alcides self would dread, Although the first drad Python conquered, And th'other vanquisht th'Erymanthian Boar, The Némean Lion and a many more. What strength of arm, or Art-full stratagem, From Nile's fell Rover could deliuer them, The Crocodile. Who runs, and rowes, warring by Land and Water 'Gainst men and Fishes, subiect to his slaughter? Or from the furious Dragon, which alone Dragon. Set-on a Roman Army; whereupon Stout Regulus as many Engines spent, As to the ground would Carthage wals haue rent? What shot-free Corslet, or what counsell crafty, 'Gainst the angry Aspick could assure them safety, Aspick. Who (faithfull husband) over Hill and Plain Pursues the man that his deer Pheer hath slain; Whom he can finde amid the thickest throng, And in an instant venge him of his wrong? What shield of Aiax could avoid their death By th'Basilisk, whose pestilentiall breath Basilisk. Doth pearce firm Marble, and whose banefull ey Wounds with a glance, so that the soundest dy? Lord! if so be, thou for mankinde didst rear Why God created such noysom and dangerous creatures: Sin the occasion of the hurt they can do vs. This rich round Mansion (glorious every where) Alas! why didst thou on This-Day create These harmfull Beasts, which but exasperate Our thorny life? O! wert thou pleas'd to form Th'innammel'd Scorpion, and the Viper-worm, Th'horned Cerastes, th'Alexandrian Skink, Th'Adder, and Drynas (full of odious stink) Th'Eft, Snake, and Dipsas (causing deadly Thirst): Why hast thou arm'd them with a rage so curst? Pardon, good God, pardon me; 'twas our pride, Not thou, that troubled our first happy tyde, And in the Childehood of the World did bring Th'Amphisbena, her double banefull sting. Before that Adam did revolt from Thee, And (curious) tasted of the sacred Tree, He lived King of Eden, and his brow Was never blankt with pallid fear, as now: The fiercest Beasts, would at his word, or beck, Bow to his yoak their self-obedient neck; As now the ready Horse is at command Simile. To the good Rider's spur, or word, or wand; And doth not wildely his own will perform, But his that rules him with a steddy arm. Yea, as forgetfull of so foul offence, Thou left'st him (yet) sufficient wisdom, whence God hath giuen vs wisedome to auoid and vanquish them. He might subdue, and to his seruice stoop The stubborn'st heads of all the savage troop. Of all the creatures through the Welkin gliding, Walking on Earth, or in the Waters sliding, Th'hast armed som with Poyson, som with Paws, Som with sharp Antlers, som with griping Claws, Som with keen Tushes, som with crooked Beaks, Som with thick Cuirets, som with scaly necks; But mad'st Man naked, and for Weapons fit Thou gav'st him nothing but a pregnant Wit; Which rusts and duls, except it subiect finde Worthy it's worth, whereon it self to grinde; And (as it were) with envious armies great, Be round about besieged and beset. For, what boot Milo's brawny shoulders broad, And sinnewie arms, if but a common load He alwaies bear? what Bayes, or Oliue boughs, Parsley, or Pine, shall crown his warlike brows, Except som other Milo, entring Lists, Courageously his boasted strength resists? “In deepest perils shineth Wisdoms prime: “Through thousand deaths true Valour seeks to clime; “Well knowing, Conquest yeelds but little Honour, “If bloody Danger doo not wait vpon her. God hath set them at enmity among themselues.O gracious Father! th'hast not onely lent Prudence to Man, the Perils to prevent, Wherewith these foes threaten his feeble life: But (for his sake) hast set at mutuall strife Serpents with Serpents, and hast rais'd them foes The Viper and Scorpion with their young.Which, vnprovoked, felly them oppose. Thou mak'st th'ingratefull Viper (at his birth) His dying Mothers belly to gnaw forth: Thou mak'st the Scorpion (greedy after food) Vnnaturally devour his proper brood; Whereof, one scaping from the Parents hunger, With's death doth vengeance on his brethrens wronger: The Weazell against the Basiliske.Thou mak'st the Weazell, by a secret might, Murder the Serpent with the murdering sight; Who so surpris'd, striving in wrathfull manner, Dying himself, kils with his baen his Baner. The Ichneumon against the Aspick.Thou mak'st th'Ichneumon (whom the Memphs adore) To rid of Poysons Nile's manured shore; Although (indeed) he doth not conquer them So much by strength as subtle stratagem. As he that (vrg'd with deep indignity) By a proud Chalenge doth his foe defie, Premeditates his posture and his play, And arms himselfe so complete every way (With wary hand guided with watchfull eye, And ready foot to traverse skilfully) That the Defendant, in the heat of fight, Findes no part open for his blade to light: So Pharaohs Rat, yer he begin the fray 'Gainst the blinde Aspick, with a cleauing Clay Vpon his coat he wraps an earthen Cake, Which afterward the Suns hot beams doo bake: Arm'd with this Plaister, th'Aspick he approcheth, And in his throat his crooked tooth he broacheth; While th'other boot-less striues to pearce and prick Through the hard temper of his armour thick: Yet, knowing himselfe too-weak (for all his wile) Alone to match the scaly Crocodile; He, with the Wren, his Ruin doth conspire. The Ichneumon and the Wren against the Crocodile. The Wren, who seeing (prest with sleeps desire) Nile's poys'ny Pirate press the slimy shoar, Suddenly coms, and hopping him before, Into his mouth he skips, his teeth he pickles, Clenseth his palate, and his throat so tickles, That charm'd with pleasure, the dull Serpent gapes Wider and wider with his vgly chaps: Then like a shaft, th'Ichneumon instantly Into the Tyrants greedy gorge doth fly, And feeds vpon that Glurton, for whose Riot All Nile's fat mergents scarce could furnish diet. Nay, more (good Lord) th'hast taught Mankind a Reason God hath taught vs to make great vse of them. To draw Life out of Death, and Health from Poyson: So that in equall Balance balancing The Good and Euill which these Creatures bring Vnto Mans life, we shall perceiue, the first By many grains to ouer waigh the worst. From Serpents scap't, yet am I scarce in safety: Fierce and vntameable beasts. Alas! I see a Legion fierce and lofty Of Sauvages, whose fleet and furious pase, Whose horrid roaring, and whose hideous face Make my sense sense-less, and my speech restrain, And cast me in my former fears again. Already howls the waste-Fold Wolf, the Boar The Wolf. Boar. Whets foamy Fangs, the hungry Bear doth roar, Bear. The Cat-faç't Ounce, that doth me much dismay, Ounce. With grumbling horror threatens my decay; The light-foot Tigre, spotted Leopard, Tigre. Leopard. Foaming with fury do besiege me hard; Then th'Vnicorn, th'Hyæna tearing-tombs, Vnicorn. Hyæna. Swift Mantichor', and Nubian Cephus coms: Mantichora, a kind of Hyæna. Cephus a kind of Ape or Monkey Chiurcæ. Of which last three, each hath (as heer they stand) Man's voice, Man's visage, Man-like foot and hand. I fear the Beast bred in the bloody Coast Of Cannibals, which thousand times (almost) Re-whelps her whelps, and in her tender womb Shee doth as oft her liuing brood re-tomb. The Poroupine.But O! what Monster's this that bids me battell, On whose rough back an Hoast of Pikes doth rattle: Who string-less shoots so many arrows out, Whose thorny sides are hedged round about With stiff steel-pointed quils, and all his parts Bristled with Bodkins, arm'd with Auls and Darts, Which ay fierce darting, seem still fresh to spring, And to his aid still new supplies to bring? O fortunate Shaft-neuer-wanting Boaw-man! Who, as thou fleest, canst hit thy following foe-man, And neuer missest (or but very narrow) Th'intended mark of thy selfs-kinred Arrow: Who, still self-furnisht, needest borrow neuer Diana's shafts, nor yet Apollo's quiver, Nor boaw-strings fetcht from Carian Aleband, Brazell from Peru, but hast all at hand Of thine own growth; for in thy Hide do growe Thy String, thy Shafts, thy Quiver and thy Bowe. The Lion, King of Beasts.But (Courage now.) Heer coms the valiant Beast, The noble Lion, King of all the rest; Who, brauely-minded, is as milde to those That yeeld to him, as fierce vnto his foes: To humble suiters neither stern nor statefull; To benefactors never found ingratefull. A memorable History of a Lion acknowledging the kindnes he had receiued of Androdus a Roman Slaue.I call to record that same Roman Thrall, Who (to escape from his mechanicall And cruell Master, that (for lucre) vs'd him Not as a Man; but, as a Beast, abus'd him) Fled through the desart, and with trauell tir'd, At length into a mossie caue retir'd: But there, no sooner 'gan the drowzy wretch On the soft grass his weary limbs to stretch; But, coming swift into the caue, he seeth A ramping Lion gnashing of his teeth. A thief, to shamefull execution sent By Iustice, for his faults iust punishment, Feeling his eyes clout, and his elbows cord, Waiting for nothing but the fatall Sword; Dies yer his death, he looks so certainly Without delay in that drad place to Dy: Even so the Slaue, seeing no means to shun (By flight or fight) his fear'd destruction (Having no way to flee, nor arms to fight, But sighs and tears, prayers and wofull plight) Embraceth Death; abiding, for a stown, Pale, cold, and senseless, in a deadly swown. At last, again his courage 'gan to gather, When he perceiv'd no rage (but pitty rather) In his new Hoast, who with milde looks and meek Seem'd (as it were) succour of him to seek, Shewing him oft one of his paws, wherein A festering thorn for a long time had been. Then (though still fearfull) did the Slaue draw nigher, And from his foot he lightly snatcht the bryer; And wringing gently with his hand the wound, Made th'hot impostume run vpon the ground. Thenceforth the Lion seeks for Booties best Through Hill and Dale, to cheere his new-com Guest, His new Physician; who, for all his cost, Soon leaues his Lodging, and his dreadfull Hoast; And once more wanders through the wildernes, Whither his froward Fortune would address, Vntill (re-taen) his fell Lord brought him home, For Spectacle vnto Imperiall Rome, To be (according to their barbarous Laws) Bloudily torn with greedy Lions paws. Fell Cannibal! Flint-harted Polyphem! If thou would'st needs exactly torture him (Inhumane Monster, hatefull Lestrigon) Why from thine owne hand hast thou let him gon, To Bears and Lions to be giuen for prey, Thy self more fel, a thousand-fold, then they? African Panthers, Hyrcan Tigres fierce, Cleonian Lions, and Pannonian Bears, Be not so cruell, as who violates Sacred Humanity, and cruciates His loyall subiects; making Recreations Of Massacres, Combats, and sharp Taxations. 'Boue all the Beasts that fill'd the Martian Field With bloud and slaughter, one was most beheld; One valiant Lion, whose victorious fights Had conquered hundreds of those guilty wights, Whose feeble skirmish had but striv'n in vain To scape by combat their deserued pain. That very Beast, with faint and fearfull fect This Runnagate (at last) is forc't to meet; And being entred in the bloody List, The Lion rowz'd, and ruffles-vp his Crest, Shortens his body, sharpens his grimey, And (staring wide) he roareth hideously: Then often swindging, with his sinnewy train, Somtimes his sides, somtimes the dusty Plain, He whets his rage, and strongly rampeth on Against his foe; who, nigh already gon To drink of Lethe, lifteth to the Pole Religious vows; not for his life, but soule. After the Beast had marcht som twenty pase, He sodain stops: and, viewing well the face Of his pale foe, remembred (rapt with ioy) That this was he that eased his annoy: Wherefore, conuerting from his hatefull wildenes, From pride to pittie, and from rage to mildenes, On his bleak face he both his eyes doth fix, Fawning for homage, his lean hands he licks. The Slaue, thus knowing, and thus being knowen, Lifts to the Heav'ns his front now hoary growne, And (now no more fearing his tearing paws) He stroaks the Lion, and his poule he claws, And learns by proof, that A good turne at need, At first or last, shall be assur'd of meed. Nosce te ipsum. Ther's vnder Sun (as Delphos God did showe) No better Knowledge, then Our selfe to Knowe: The second part of this sixt book: Wherein is discoursed at large of the creation of Man.Ther is no Theam more plentifull to scan, Then is the glorious goodly Frame of Man: For in Man's self is Fire, Aire, Earth and Sea; Man's (in a word) the World's Epitome Or little Map: which heer my Muse doth try By the grand Pattern to exemplifie. And of the wonders of Gods wisedom, appearing both in his body and Soule.A witty Mason, doth not (with rare Art) Into a Palace, Paros Rocks conuert, Seel it with gold, and to the Firmament Rayse the proud Turrets of his Battlement, And (to be brief) in euery part of it, Beauty to vse, vse vnto beauty fit, To th'end the Skrich-Owl, and Night-Rauen should In those fair walls their habitations hold: But rather, for som wise and wealthy Prince Able to iudge of his arts excellence: Even so, the Lord built not this All-Theater, The world made for Man.For the rude guests of Air, and Woods and Water; But, all for Him, who (whether he survey The vast salt kingdoms, or th'Earth's fruitfull clay, Or cast his eyes vp to those twinkling Eyes That with disordered order gild the Skyes) Can every-where admire with due respect Th'admired Art of such an Architect. Man was created last, &amp; why.Now of all Creatures which his VVord did make, Man was the last that liuing breath did take: Not that he was the least; or that God durst Not vndertake so noble a VVork at first: Rather, because he should haue made in vain So great a Prince, without on whom to Raign. A wise man neuer brings his bidden Guest Into his Parlour, till his Room be drest, Fit comparison. Garnisht with Lights, and Tables neatly spred Be with full dishes well-nigh furnished: So our great God, who (bountious) euer keeps Heer open Court, and th'ever-bound-less Deeps Of sweetest Nectar on vs still distills By twenty-times ten thousand sundry quills, Would not our Grandsire to his Boord inuite, Yer he with Arras his fair house had dight, And, vnder starry State-Cloaths plaç't his plates Fill'd with a thousand sugred delicates. All th'admirable Creatures made beforn, All other creatures nothing in respect of Man, made to the Image of God, with (at it were) great preparation, not all at once, but by interims first his Body, and then his reasonable Soule. Which Heav'n and Earth, and Ocean doo adorn, Are but Essays, compar'd in every part, To this divinest Master-Piece of Art. Therefore the supream peer-less Architect, When (of meer nothing) he did first erect Heav'n, Earth and Aire, and Seas; at once his thought, His word and deed all in an instant wrought: But, when he would his own selfs Type create, Th'honour of Nature, th'Earths sole Potentate; As if he would a Councell hold he citeth His sacred Power, his Prudence he inuiteth, Summons his Loue, his Iustice he adiourns, Calleth his Goodnes, and his Grace returns, To (as it were) consult about the birth And building of a second God, of Earth; And each (a-part) with liberall hand to bring Som excellence vnto so rare a thing. Or rather, he consults wi h's only Son (His own true Pourtrait) what proportion, What gifts, what grace, what soule he should bestowe Gen. 1. 15. Vpon his Vice-Roy of this Realm belowe. When th'other things God fashion'd in their kinde, The Sea t'abound in Fishes he assign'd, The Earth in Flocks: but, having Man in hand His very self he seemed to command. He both at-once both life and body lent To other things; but when in Man he meant In mortall limbs immortall life to place, Hee seem'd to pawse, as in a waighty case: And so at sundry moments finished The Soule and Body of Earth's glorious Head. Admired Artist, Architect divine, Inuocation. Perfect and peer-less in all Works of thine, So my rude hand on this rough Table guide To paint the Prince of all thy Works beside, That graue Spectators, in his face may spy Apparant marks of thy Divinity. Almighty Father, as of watery matter It pleas'd thee make the people of the VVater: Mans body created of the dust of the Earth.So, of an earthly substance mad'st thou all The slimy Burgers of this Earthly Ball; To th'end each Creature might (by consequent) Part-sympathize with his own Element. Therefore, to form thine Earthly Emperour, Thou tookest Earth, and by thy sacred power So tempered'st it, that of the very same Dead shape-less lump didst Adams body frame: Yet, not his face down to the Earth ward bending (Like Beasts that but regard their belly, ending For ever all) but toward th'azure Skyes Bright golden Lamps lifting his louely Eyes; That through their nerues, his better part might look Still to that place from whence her birth she took. His head the seat of vnderstanding.Also thou plantedst th'Intellectuall Powr In th'highest stage of all this stately Bowr, That thence it might (as from a Cittadell) Command the members that too-oft rebell Against his Rule: and that our Reason, there Keeping continuall Garrison (as't were) Might Auarice, Enuy, and Pride subdue, Lust Gluttony, Wrath, Sloath, and all their Crew Of factious Commons, that still striue to gaine The golden Scepter from their Soverain. The Eyes full of infinite admiration.Th'Eyes (Bodie's guides) are set for Sentinel In noblest place of all this Cittadel, To spy far-off, that no miss-hap befall At vnawares the sacred Animal. In forming these thy hand (so famous held) Seemed almost to haue it self excell'd, Them not transpearcing, least our eyes should be As theirs, that Heav'n through hollow Canes do see, Yet see small circuit of the welkin bright, The Canes strict compass doth so clasp their Sight: And least so many open holes disgrace The goodly form of th'Earthly Monarch's face. These louely Lamps, whose sweet sparks liuely turning, With sodain glaunce set coldest hearts a-burning, These windows of the Soule, these starry Twinns, These Cupids quivers haue so tender skinns Through which (as through a pair of shining glasses) Their radiant point of pearcing splendor passes, That they would soon be quenched and put-out, But that the Lord hath Bulwarkt them about; By seating so their wondrous Orb, betwix The Front, the Nose, and the vermillion Cheeks: As in two Vallies pleasantly inclosed The Browes and Eyelids. With pretty Moon ains orderly disposed. And as a Pent-house doth preserue a Wall From Rain and Hail, and other Storms that fall: The twinkling Lids with their quick-trembling hairs Defend the Eyes from thousand dang'rous fears. VVho fain would see how much a human face A comly Nose doth beautifie and grace; Behould Zopyrus, who cut-off his Nose For's Princes sake, to circumvent his foes. The Nose, no less for vse then beauty makes: The Nose:. For, as a Conduit, it both giues and takes Our liuing breath: it's as a Pipe put-vp, Whereby the moyst Brain's spongy boan doth sup Sweet smelling fumes: it serueth as a gutter To voyd the Excrements of grossest matter; As by the Scull-seams and the Pory Skin Evaporate those that are light and thin: As through black Chimneyes flyes the bitter smoak, VVhich but so vented would the Houshould choak. And, sith that Time doth with his secret file Fret and diminish each thing every-while, And whatsoever heer begins and ends, VVears every howr and its self-substance spends; Th'Almighty made the Mouth to recompence The Mouth. The Stomachs pension, and the Times expence (Even as the green Trees, by their roots resume Sap for the sap, that howrly they consume) And plaç't it so, that alwayes by the way, By sent of meats the Nose might take Essay, The watchfull Ey wight true distinction make 'Twixt Herbs and Weeds, betwixt an Eel and Snake; And then th'impartiall Tongue might (at the last) The Tongus. Censure their goodnes by their savory taste. Two equall ranks of Orient Pearls impale The Teeth. The open Throat: which (Quern-like) grinding small Th'imperfect food, soon to the Stomach send-it (Our Maister-Cook) whose due concoctions mend-it. But least the Teeth, naked and bare to Light, Should in the Face present a ghastly sight; With wondrous Art, ouer that Mill do meet Two moouing Leaues of Corall soft and sweet. O mouth! by thee, our savage Elders, yerst The Lips. Through way-less Woods, and hollow Rocks disperst, VVith Acorns fed, with Fells of Feathers clad Of the excellent vse and end of speach.(VVhen neyther Traffik, Love, nor Law they had) Themselues vniting, built them Towns, and bent Their willing necks to civill Government. O Mouth! by thee, the rudest Wits haue learn'd The Noble Arts, which but the wise discern'd. By thee, we kindle in the coldest spirits Heroïk flames affecting glorious merits. By thee, we wipe the tears of wofull Eyes: By thee, we stop the stubborn mutinies Of our rebellious Flesh, whose rest-less Treason Striues to dis-throne and to dis-sceptre Reason. By thee, our Soules with Heav'n haue conuersation. By thee, we calm th'Almighties indignation, When faithfull sighs from our soules centre fly About the bright Throne of his Maiesty. By thee, we warble to the King of Kings; Our Tongue's the Bowe, our Teeth the trembling Strings, Our hollow Nostrils (with their double vent) The hollow Belly of the Instrument; Our Soule's the sweet Musician, that playes So divine lessons, and so Heav'nly layes, As, in deep passion of pure burning zeal, Ioues forked Lightnings from his fingers steal. The Eares.But O! what member hath more marvails in't, Then th'Ears round-winding double labyrinth? The Bodie's Scouts, of sounds the Censurers, Doors of the Soule, and faithfull Messengers Of diuine treasures, when our gracious Lord Sends vs th'Embassage of his sacred Word. And, sith all Sound seems alwaies to ascend, God plac't the Ears (where they might best attend) As in two Turrets, on the buildings top, Snailling their hollow entries so a-sloap, That, while the voyce about those windings wanders, The sound might lengthen in those bow'd Meanders; As, from a trumpet, Winde hath longer life, Or, from a Sagbut, then from Flute or Fife: Sundry Similies expressing the reason of the round winding Mazes of the Eares.Or as a noyse extendeth far and wide In winding Vales, or by the crooked side Of crawling Riuers; or with broken trouble Between the teeth of hollow Rocks doth double; And that no sodaine sound, with violence Pearcing direct the Organs of this Sense, Should stun the Brain, but through these Mazie holes Conueigh the voyce more softly to our Soules: Another comparison to that purpose. As th'Ouse, that crooking in and out doth run From Stony-Stratford towards Huntingdon, By Royall Amptill; rusheth not so swift, As our neer Kennet, vvhose Trowt-famous Drift From Marleborow, by Hungerford doth hasten Through Newbery, and Prince-grac't Aldermaston, Her Siluer Nymphs (almost) directly leading, To meet her Mistress (the great Thames) at Reading. But will my hands, in handling th'human Stature, The hands. Forget the Hands, the handmaids vnto Nature, Th'Almighty's Apes, the Instruments of Arts, The voluntary Champions of our hearts, Minde's Ministers, the Clarks of quick conceipts, And bodies victuallers, to prouide it meats? Will you the Knees and Elbow's springs omit, Ioynts. The Knees and Armes. Which serue th'whole Body by their motions fit? For, as a Bowe, according as the string, Is stiff or slack, the shafts doth farther fling, Our Nerues and Gristles diuersly dispense, To th'human Frame, meet Motion, Might and Sense: Knitting the Bones, which be the Pillars strong The Sinewes, Gristles and Bones. The Beams and Rafters, whose firm Ioynts may long (Maugre Deaths malice, till our Maker calls) Support the Fabrick of these Fleshly Walls? Can you conceal the Feets rare-skilfull feature, The Feet. The goodly Bases of this glorious Creature? But, is't not time now, in his Inner Parts, To see th'Almightie's admirable Arts? First, with my Launcet shall I make incision, To see the Cells of the twin Brains diuision: The Treasurer of Arts, the Source of Sense: The Seat of Reason; and the Fountain, whence Our sinewes flowe: whom Natures prouidence Arm'd with a helme, whose double lynings fence The Brain's cold moisture from its boany Armor, Whose hardnes else might hap to bruise or harm-her: A Registre, where (with a secret touch) The studious daily som rare Knowledge couch? O, how shall I on learned Leaf forth-set That curious Maze, that admirable Net, Through whose fine folds the spirit doth rise and fall, Making its powrs of Vital, Animal! Euen as the Blood, and Spirits, wandering Through the preparing vessels crooked Ring, Are in their winding course concoct and wrought, And by degrees to fruitfull Seed are brought. Shall I the Hearts vn-equall sides explain, Of the Heart. Which equall poiz doth equally sustaine? Wherof, th'one's fill'd with bloud, in th'other bides The vitall Spirit which through the body slides: Whose rest-less panting, by the constant Pulse, Doth witness health; or if that take repulse, And shift the dance and wonted pase it went, It shewes that Nature's wrongd by Accident. Of the Lungs.Or, shall I cleaue the Lungs, whose motions light Our inward heat doo temper day and night; Like Summer gales wauing, with gentle puffs, The smiling Meadows green and gaudy tuffs: Light, spungy Fans, that euer take and giue Th'æthereall Air, whereby we breathe and liue: Bellows, whose blast (breathing by certain pawses) A pleasant sound through our speech-Organs causes? Of the Stomach.Or, shall I rip the Stomachs hollowness, That ready Cook concocting euery Mess, Which in short time it cunningly conuerts Into pure Liquor fit to feed the parts; And then the same doth faithfully deliuer Of the Liuer.Into the Port-vain passing to the Liuer, Who turns it soone to Blood; and thence again Through branching pipes of the great Hollow-vain, Through all the members doth it duly scatter: An apt Similitude.Much like a Fountain, whose diuided Water It selfe dispersing into hundred Brooks, Bathes som fair Garden with her winding Crooks, For, as these Brooks, thus branching round about, Make heer the Pink, there th'Aconite to sprout, Heer the sweet Plum-tree, the sharp Mulbery there, Heer the lowe Vine, and there the lofty Pear, Heer the hard Almond, there the tender Fig, Heer bitter Worm-wood, there sweet-smelling Spike: Of the Bloud &amp; Nourishment.Euen so the Blood (bred of good nourishment) By diuers Pipes to all the Body sent, Turns heer to Bones, there changes into Nerues, Heer is made Marrow, there for Muscles serues, Heer Skin becoms, there crooking Veins, there Flesh, To make our Limbs more forcefull and more fresh. But, now me list no neerer view to take Of th'inward Parts, which God did secret make, Nor pull in pieces all the Human Frame: That work were fitter for those men of Fame, Those skilfull sons of Æsculapius: Hippocrates; or deep Herophilus: Or th'eloquent and artificiall Writ Of Galen, that renowned Pergamite. 'T sufficeth me, in som sort, to express By this Essay the sacred mightiness, Not of Iaphetus witty-fained Son, But of the true Prometheus, that begun And finisht (with inimitable Art) Of the Creation of the Soule. The famous Image, I haue sung in part. Now, this more peer-less learned Imager, Life to his louely Picture to confer, Did not extract out of the Elements A certain secret Chymick Quint-essence: But, breathing, sent as from the liuely Spring Of his Diuineness som small Riuerling, It self dispersing into euery pipe Of the frail Engin of this earthen Type. Not, that his own Selfs-Essence blest he brake, Of her Essence and Substance. Or did his Triple-Vnity partake Vnto his Work; but, without Selfs-expence Inspir'd it richly with rare excellence: And by his powr so spred his Rais thereon, That euen as yet appears a portion Of that pure lustre of Cœlestiall Light Wherwith at first it was adorn'd and dight. This Adam's spirit did from that Spirit deriue Whence it is preceeded. Which made the World: yet did not thence depriue Of Gods Self-substance any part at all; As in the Course of Nature doth befall, Diuers Similes. That from the Essence of an Earthly Father, An Earthly Son essentiall parts doth gather: Or as in Spring-time from one sappy twig Ther sprouts another consubstantiall sprig. In brief, it's but a breath. Now, though the breath Out of our Stomachs concaue issueth; Yet, of our substance it transporteth nought: Onely it seemeth to be simply fraught And to retain the purer qualities Of th'inward place whence it deriued is. Inspired by that Breath, this Breath desire I to describe. Whoso doth not admire His spirit, is sprightless; and his sense is past, Of the excellence of Mans soule. Who hath no sense of that admired Blast. Yet wot I well, that as the Ey perceiues All but it self, even so our Soule conceiues All saue her own selfs-Essence; but, the end Of her own greatnes cannot comprehend. Yet as a sound Ey, void of vicious matter, Sees (in a sort) it self in Glass or Water: How she may knowe her selfe. So, in her sacred Works (as in a Glass) Our Soule (almost) may see her glorious face. The boistrous Winde, that rents with roaring blasts Three fit comparisons to that purpose. The lofty Pines, and to the Welkin casts Millions of Mountains from the watery World, And proudest Turrets to the ground hath whurld: The pleasing fume that fragrant Roses yeeld, When wanton Zephyr, sighing on the field, Enammels all; and, to delight the Sky, The Earth puts-on her richest Lyuory: Th'accorded Discords, that are sweetly sent From th'Iuory ribs of som rare Instrument, Cannot be seen: but he may well be said Of Flesh, and Ears, and Nose in irely void, Who doth not feel; nor hear, nor smell (the powrs) The shock, sound, sent; of storms, of strings, of flowrs. The Soule not onely vitall, but a so diuine and immortall.Although our Soule's pure substance, to our sight Be not subiected; yet her motion light And rich discourse, sufficient proofs do giue, We haue more soule than to suffize to liue; A Soule diuine, pure, sacred, admirable, Immortall, end-less, simple, vnpalpable. The Seat of the Soule.For, whether that the Soule (the Mint of Art) Be all in all, or all in euery part: Whether the Brain or Heart doo lodge the Soule, O Seneca, where, where could'st thou enroule Those many hundred words (in Prose or Verse) Which at first hearing thou could'st back reherse? Notable examples of excellent Memories.Where could great Cyrus that great Table shut Wherein the Pictures and the names he put Of all the Souldiers, that by thousands wander'd After the fortunes of his famous Standard? In what deep vessell did th'Embassader Of Pyrrhus (whom the Delphian Oracler Deluded by his double-meaning Measures) Into what Cisterns did he pour those Treasures Of learned store, which after (for his vse) In time and place, he could so fit produce? The Memory, is th'Eyes true Register, The Peasants Book, Times wealthy Treasorer, Keeping Records of Acts and Accidents Whats'euer, subiect vnto humane sense, Since first the Lord the Worlds foundations laid, Or Phœbus first his golden locks displaid, And his pale Sister from his beaming light Borrow'd her splendor to adorn the Night. So that our Reason, searching curiously Through all the Roules of a good Memory, And fast'ning closely with a Gordian knot To Past Euents, what Present Times allot, Fore-sees the Future, and becoms more sage, More happily to lead our later age. And, though our Soule liue as imprison'd here, In our frail flesh, or buried (as it were) In a dark Toomb; Yet at one flight she flies Of the quick swiftnes, &amp; sodain motion of the Soule: comprehending all things in Heau? and Earth. From Calpe t'Imaus, from the Earth to Skies; Much swifter then the Chariot of the Sun, Which in a Day about the World doth run. For, somtimes, leaving these base slimy heaps, With cheerfull spring aboue the Clouds she leaps, Glides through the Aire, and there she learns to knowe Th'Originals of Winde, and Hail, and Snowe, Of Lightning, Thunder, Blazing-Stars and storms, Of Rain and Ice, and strange Exhaled Forms. By th'Aires steep-stairs, she boldly climbs aloft To the Worlds Chambers; Heav'n she visits oft, Stage after Stage: she marketh all the Sphears, And all th'harmonious, various course of theirs: With sure account, and certain Compasses, She counts their Stars, she metes their distances And differing pases; and, as if she found. No Subiect fair enough in all this Round, She mounts aboue the Worlds extreamest Wall, Far, far beyond all things corporeall; Where she beholds her Maker, face to face, (His frowns of Iustice, and his smiles of Grace) The faithfull zeal, the chaste and sober Port And sacred Pomp of the Celestiall Court. What can be hard to a sloath-shunning Spirit, Of learned, curious, pleasant, maruailous, and more then humane inuention of mans wit. Spurr'd with desire of Fames eternall merit? Look (if thou canst) from East to Occident, From Island to the Moors hot Continent; And thou shalt nought perfectly fair behould, But Pen, or Pencill, Graving-tool; or Mould, Hath so resembled, that scarce can our ey The Counterfait from the true thing descry. The brazen Mare that famous Myron cast, Which Stalions leapt, and for a Mare imbrac't: The liuely picture of that ramping Vine Of Caruing and Painting. Which whilom Zeuxis limn'd so rarely fine, That shoals of Birds, beguiled by the shapes, Peckt at the Table, as at very Grapes: The Marble Statue, that with strangest fire Fondly in flam'd th'Athenian Youths desire: Apelles Venus, which allur'd well-neer As many Loues, as Venus selfe had heer; Are proofs enow that learned Painting can, Can (Goddess-like) another Nature frame. But th'Art of Man, not onely can compack The subtile conclusions of the Mathematickes. witnes Archytas Doue. Features and forms that life and Motion lack; But also fill the Aire with painted shoals Of flying Creatures (Artificiall Fowls) The Tarentines valiant and learned Lord, Archytas, made a wooden Doue, that soar'd About the Welkin, by th'accorded sleights And counterpoize of sundry little weights. The Eagle and the Fly, of Iohn de Monte-Regio: or Regi-Montanus.Why should I not that wooden Eagle mention (A learned Germanes late admir'd invention) Which mounting from his fist that framed her, Flew far to meet an Almain Emperour; And hauing met him, with her nimble train, And weary wings, turning about again, Follow'd him close vnto the Castle Gate Of Noremberg; whom all the Showes of State, Streets hangd with Arras, Arches curious built, Loud-thundring Canons, Columns richly gilt, Gray-headed Senate, and Youth's gallantise, Grac't not so much, as onely This Deuice. Once, as this Artist (more with mirth then meat) Feasted some friends that he esteemed great, From vnder's hand an iron Fly flew out; Which having flowen a perfect Round-about, With weary wings, return'd vnto her Master, And (as iudicious) on his arme she plac't-her. O divine wit! that in the narrow womb Of a small Fly, could finde sufficient room For all those Springs, wheels, counterpoiz, and chains, Which stood in stead of life, and spur, and rains. Astronomy.Yea, you your selues ye bright Celestiall Orbs, Although no stop your rest-less Dance disturbs, Nor stayes your Course; yet can ye not escape The hands of men that are but men in shape. The king of Persia his Heauen of Glasse.A Persian Monarch, not content, well-nigh With the Earths bounds to bound his Empery: To raign in Heav'n, rais'd not with bold defiance (Like braving Nimrod, or those boisterous Gyants) Another Babel, or a heap of Hils: But, without moving from the Earth, he builds A Heav'n of Glass, so huge, that there-upon Somtimes erecting his ambitious, Throne, Beneath his proud feet (like a God) he saw The shining Lamps of th'other Heav'n, to draw Down to the Deep, and thence againe advance (Like glorious Brides) their golden Radiance: Yet had the Heav'n no wondrous excellence (Saue Greatness) worthy of so great a Prince. Admirable Dialls &amp; Clocks, namely, at this Day, that of Straesbourg.But, who would think, that mortall hands could mould New Heav'ns, new Stars, whose whirling courses should With constant windings, though contrary waies, Mark the true mounds of Years, and Months, and Dayes? Yet 't is a story that hath oft been heard, And by graue Witness hundred times averr'd, That, that profound Briareus, who of yore (As selfly arm'd with thousand hands and more) Maintain'd so long the Syracusian Towns 'Gainst great Marcellus and his Roman Powrs: The Engines of Archimedes, &amp; his Sphear. Who fin'd his foes Fleet with a wondrous Glass: Who hugest Vessels that did ever pass The Tirrhen Seas, turn'd with his onely hand From Shoar to Sea, and from the Sea to Land: Framed a Sphear, where every Wandring Light, Of lower Heav'ns and th'vpper Tapers, bright, Whose glistring flames the Firmament adorn, Did (of themselues) with ruled motion turn. Nor may we smother, or forget (ingrately) The Heauen of Siluer sent by the Emperor Ferdinand to Solyman the great Turk. The Heav'n of Silver, that was sent (but lately) From Ferdinando (as a famous Work) Vnto Bizantium to the Greatest Turk: Wherein, a spirit, still moving to and fro, Made all the Engin orderly to go: And though th'one Sphear did alwaies slowely slide, And (opposite) the other swiftly glide; Yet still their Stars kept all their Courses ev'n With the true Courses of the Stars of Heav'n. The Sun, there shifting in the Zodiack His shining Houses, never did forsake His pointed Path: there, in a Month, his Sister Fulfill'd her course, and changing oft her lustre And form of Face (now larger, lesser soon) Follow'd the Changes of the other Moon. O compleat Creature! who the starry Sphears Of mans resembl?ce to his first Patern, which is God. Canst make to moue, who 'boue the Heav'nly Bears Extend'st thy powr, who guidest with thy hand The Day's bright Chariot, and the nightly Brand: This curious Lust to imitate the best And fairest Works of the Almightiest, By rare effects bears record of thy Linage And high descent; and that his sacred Image Was in thy Soule ingrav'n, when first his Spirit (The spring of life) did in thy limms inspire-it. For, as his Beauties are past all compare; So is thy Soule all beautifull and fair. As hee's immortall; and is never idle: Thy Soule's immortall; and can brook no bridle Of sloath, to curb her busie Intellect: He ponders all; thou peizest each effect: And thy mature and settled Sapience Hath som alliance with his Prouidence: He works by Reason; thou by Rule: Hee's glory Of th'Heav'nly Stages; thou of th'Earthly Story: Hee's great High-priest; thou his great Vicar heer: Hee's Soverain Prince; and thou his Vice-Roy deer. Other testimonies of the excellency of Man, constituted Lord of the World.For, soon as ever he had framed thee, Into thy hands he put this Monarchy; Made all the Creatures knowe thee for their Lord; And com before thee of their own accord: And gaue thee power (as Master) to impose Fit sense-full Names vnto the Hoast that rowes In watery Regions; and the wandring Heards Of Forrest people; and the painted Birds. O too-too happy! had that Fall of thine Not cancell'd so the Character diuine. Wherein consisteth Mans felicity.But sith our Soules now-sin-obscured Light Shines through the Lanthorn of our Flesh so bright; What sacred splendor will this Star send forth, When it shall shine without this vail of Earth? The Soule, heer lodg'd, is like a man that dwels In an ill Aire, annoy'd with noysom smels; Execellent comparisons.In an old House, open to winde and weather; Never in Health, not half an houre together: Or (almost) like a Spider, who confin'd In her Webs centre, shak't with every winde; Moues in an instant, if the buzzing Flie Stir but a string of her Lawn Canapie. Of the Creation of Woman made for an ayde to Man, and without whom Mans lyfe were miserable.You that haue seen within this ample Table, Among so many Modules admirable, Th'admired beauties of the King of Creatures, Com, com and see the Womans rapting features: Without whom (heer) Man were but half a man, But a wilde Wolfe, but a Barbarian, Brute, ragefull, fierce, moody, melancholike, Hating the Light; whom nought but naught could like: Born solely for himselfe, bereft of sense, Of heart, of loue, of life, of excellence. God therefore, not to seem less liberall To Man, then else to every animall; For perfect patern of a holy Loue, To Adams half another half he gaue, Ta'en from his side, to binde (through every Age) With kinder bonds the sacred Mariage. Simile.Even as a Surgeon, minding off-to-cut Som-cureless limb; before in vre he put His violent Engins on the vitious member, Bringeth his Patient in a sense-less slumber, And grief-less then (guided by vse and Art) To saue the whole, sawes off th'infected part: So, God empal'd our Grandsires liuely look, Through all his bones a deadly chilness strook, Siel'd-vp his sparkling eyes with Iron bands, Led down his feet (almost) to Lethè Sands; In briefe, so numm'd his Soule's and Body's sense, That (without pain) opening his side, from thence Hee tooke a rib, which rarely He refin'd, And thereof made the Mother of Mankind: Graving so liuely on the living Bone All Adams beauties; that, but hardly, one Could haue the Lover from his Loue descry'd, Or know'n the Bridegroom from his gentle Bride: Sauing that she had a more smiling Ey, A smoother Chin, a Cheek of purer Dy, A fainter voyce, a more inticing Face, A Deeper Tress, a more delighting Grace, And in her bosom (more then Lillie-white) Two swelling Mounts of Ivory, panting light. Now, after this profound and pleasing Transe, Their Mariage. No sooner Adams rauisht eyes did glance On the rare beauties of his new-come Half, But in his heart he gan to leap and laugh, Kissing her kindly, calling her his Life, His Loue, his Stay, his Rest, his Weal, his Wife, His other-Selfe, his Help (him to refresh) Bone of his Bone, Flesh of his very Flesh. Source of all ioyes! sweet Hee-Shee-Coupled-One, Their Epithalamie, or wedding Song. Thy sacred Birth I never think vpon, But (rauisht) I admire how God did then Make Two of One, and One of Two again. O blessed Bond! O happy Marriage! Which doost the match 'twixt Christ and vs presage! O chastest friendship, whose pure flames impart Two Soules in one, two Hearts into one Hart! O holy knot, in Eden instituted (Not in this Earth with blood and wrongs polluted, Profan'd with mischiefs, the Pre-Scæne of Hell To cursed Creatures that 'gainst Heav'n rebell) O sacred Cov'nant, which the sin-less Son Of a pure Virgin (when he first begun To publish proofs of his drad Powr Diuine, By turning Water into perfect Wine, At lesser Cana) in a wondrous manner Did with his presence sanctifie and honour! By thy deer Fauour, after our Decease, The commodities of Mariage. We leaue-behinde our liuing Images, Change War to Peace, in kindred multiply, And in our Children liue eternally. By thee, we quench the wilde and wanton Fires, That in our Soule the Paphian shot inspires: And taught (by thee) a loue more firme and fitter, We finde the Mell more sweet, the Gall less bitter, Which heer (by turns) heap vp our humane Life Ev'n now with ioyes, anon with iars and strife. This done; the Lord commands the happy Pair Propagation by the blessing of God.With chaste embraces to replenish Fair Th'vnpeopled World; that, while the World endures, Heer might succeed their living Portraitures. He had impos'd the like precept before, On th'irefull Droues that in the Desarts rore, The feathered Flocks, and frutfull-spawning Legions Thar liue within the liquid Crystall Regions. Thence-forth therefore, Bears Bears ingendered; The Dolphins, Dolphins; Vulturs, Vulturs bred; Men, Men: and Nature with a change-less Course, Still brought forth Children like their Ancestors: Vnnatural Coniunctions produce monstrous Births.Though since indeed as (when the fire hath mixt-them) The yellow Gold and Silver pale betwixt them Another Metall (like to neither) make, Which yet of eithers riches doth partake: So, oft, two Creatures of a diuers kinde, Against the common course through All assign'd, Confounding their lust-burning seeds together, Beget an Elf, not like in all to either, But (bastard Mongrell) bearing marks apparent Of mingled members, ta'en from either Parent. Of things ingendered without seed or commixtion of sexes.God, not contented, to each Kinde to giue And to infuse the Vertue Generatiue, Made (by his Wisdom) many Creatures breed Of line-less bodies, without Venus deed. So, the colde humour breeds the Salamander, Who (in effect) like to her births Commander With childe with hundred Winters, with her touch Quencheth the Fire though glowing ne'r so much. So, of the Fire in burning furnace, springs The Fly Pyrausta with the flaming Wings: Without the Fire, it dies; within it, ioyes; Living in that, which each thing else destroyes. So, slowe Boötes vnderneath him sees, In th'ycy Iles, those Goslings hatcht of Trees; Whose fruitfull leaues, falling into the Water, Are turn'd (they say) to liuing Fowls soon after. So, rotten sides of broken Ships do change To Barnacles; O Transformation strange! 'Twas first a greeen Tree, then a gallant Hull, Lately a Mushrom, now a flying Gull. THE SEVENTH DAY OF THE FIRST WEEK. The Argvment. In sacred Rest, vpon This sacred Day Th'Eternall doth his glorious Works suruay: His only Powr and Providence perseuer T'vphold, maintain, and rule the World for euer: Maugre Mens malice and Hels raging mood, God turneth all thing to his Childrens good: Sabbaths right vse; From all Worlds-Works to cease; To pray (not play) and hear the Word of Peace: Instructions drawn from dead and liuing things, And for our selues; for all Estates; for Kings. The cunning Painter, that with curious care, By an excellent Similitude of a Painter delighted with the sight of a curious table which he hath lately finished: our Poet sheweth how God rested the seuenth Day, &amp; saw (as saith the Scripture) that all that hee had made was Good. Limning a Land-scape, various, rich, and rare, Hath set a-work, in all and every part, Invention, Iudgement, Nature, Vse, and Art; And hath at length (t'immortalize his name) With weary Pencill perfected the same; Forgets his pains; and, inly fill'd with glee, Still on his Picture gazeth greedily. First, in a Mead he marks a frisking Lamb, Which seems (though dumb) to bleat vnto the Dam: Then he obserues a Wood, seeming to waue: Then th'hollow bosom of som hideous Caue: Heer a High-way, and there a narrow Path: Heer Pines, there Oaks torn by tempestuous wrath: Heer from a craggy Rocks steep-hanging boss (Thrumm'd halfe with Iuy, halfe with crisped Moss) A siluer Brook in broken streams doth gush, And head-long down the horned Cliff doth rush; Then, winding thence aboue and vnder ground, A goodly Garden it be-moateth round: There, on his knee (behinde a Box-Tree shrinking) A skilfull Gunner with his left eye winking, Levels directly at an Oak hard by, Whereon a hundred groaning Culuers cry; Down fals the Cock, vp from the Touch-pan flies A ruddy flash that in a moment dies. Off goes the Gun, and through the Forrest rings The thundring bullet, born on fiery wings. Heer, on a Green, two Striplings, stripped light, Run for a prize with laboursom delight; A dusty Cloud about their feet doth flowe (Their feet, and head, and hands, and all do goe) They swelt in sweat; and yet the following Rout Hastens their haste with many a cheerfull shout. Heer, six pyed Oxen, vnder painfull yoak, Rip vp the folds of Ceres Winter Cloak. Heer in the shade, a pretty Sheperdess Driues softly home her bleating happiness: Still as she goes, she spins; and as she spins, A man would think som Sonnet she begins. Heer runs a River, there springs forth a Fountain, Heer vales a Valley, there ascends a Mountain, Heer smokes a Castle, there a Citie fumes, And heer a Ship vpon th'Ocean looms. In brief, so liuely, Art hath Nature shap't, That in his Work the Work-mans selfe is rapt, Vnable to look off; for, looking still, The more he looks, the more he findes his skill: God rested the seuenth Day, &amp; contemplates on his works.So th'Architect (whose glorious Workmanships My cloudy Muse doth but too-much eclipse) Having with pain-less pain, and care-less care, In these Six Dayes, finisht the Table fair And infinite of th'Vniuersall Ball, Resteth This Day, t'admire himselfe in All: And for a season eying nothing els, Ioyes in his Work, sith all his Work excels (If my dull, stutting, frozen eloquence A briefe recapitulation &amp; consideration of the Works of God in the whole World and a learned Exposition of the words of Moses Gen. 1. 31. God saw that all that he had made, was perfectly good.May dare coniecture of his high Intents). One while, hee sees how th'ample Sea doth take The Liquid homage of each other Lake; And how again the Heav'ns exhale, from it, Aboundant vapours (for our benefit): And yet it swels not for those tribute streams, Nor yet it shrinks not for those boyling beams. There sees he th'Ocean-peoples plentious broods, And shifting Courses of the Ebbs and Floods; Which with inconstant glaunces night and day The lower Planets forked front doth sway. Anon, vpon the flowry Plains he looks, Laced about with snaking siluer brooks. Now, he delights to see foure Brethrens strife Cause the Worlds peace, and keep the World in life: Anon, to see the whirling Sphears to roule In rest-less Dances about either Pole; Whereby, their Cressets (carried diuers waies) Now visit vs, anon th'Antipodés. It glads him now to note, how th'Orb of Flame, Which girts this Globe, doth not enfire the Frame: How th'Airs glib-gliding firmless body bears Such store of Fowls, Hail-storms, and Floods of tears: How th'heavy Water, pronest to descend, 'Twixt Air and Earth is able to depend: And how the dull Earth's prop-less massie Ball Stands steddy still, iust in the midst of All. Anon his nose is pleas'd with fragrant sents Of Balm and Basill, Myrrh and Frankinscense, Thyme, Spiknard, Hyssop, Sauory, Cinnamon, Pink, Violet, Rose, and Cloue-Carnation. Anon, his ear's charmd with the melody Of winged Consorts curious Harmony: For, though each bird, guided with art-less Art, After his kinde, obserue a song a-part, Yet the sole burden of their seuerall Layes Is nothing but the Heav'n-Kings glorious prayse. In briefe, th'Almightie's ey, and nose, and ear, In all his works, doth nought see, sent, or hear But showes his greatness, sauours of his grace, And sounds his glory over every place. But aboue all, Mans many beautious features Detaine the Lord more then all other Creatures: Man's his own Minion; Man's his sacred Type: And for Man's sake, he loues his Workmanship. Not that I mean to fain an idle God, That lusks in Heav'n and never looks abroad, That Crowns not Vertue, and corrects not Vice, Blinde to our seruice, deafe vnto our sighs; A Pagan Idoll, void of powr and pietie, A sleeping Dormouse (rather) a dead Deitie. For though (alas!) somtimes I cannot shun, But some profane thoughts in my minde will run, I never think on God, but I conceiue (Whence cordiall comforts Christian soules receiue) In God, Care, Counsail, Iustice, Mercy, Might, Of the Prouidence of God. To punish wrongs, and patronize their right: Sith Man (but Image of th'Almightiest) Without these gifts is not a Man, but Beast. Epicurus and his followers, denyng the same, confused by sandry Reasons.Fond Epicure, thou rather slept'st, thy self, When thou didst forge thee such a sleep-sick Elf For life's pure Fount: or vainly fraudulent (Not shunning the Atheïsts sin, but punishment) Imaginedst a God so perfect-less, In Works defying, whom thy words profess. God is not sitting (like some Earthly State) In proud Theatre, him to recreate With curious Obiects of his ears and eyes (Without disposing of the Comœdies) Content t'haue made (by his great Word) to moue So many radiant Stars as shine aboue; And on each thing with his own hand to draw The sacred Text of an eternall Law: Then, bosoming his hand to let them slide, With reans at will, whether that Law shall guide: Simile.Like one that having lately forc't som Lake, Through some new Chanell a new Course to take, Takes no more care thence-forth to those effects, But lets the Stream run where his Ditch directs. The Lord our God wants neither Diligence, 1. Gods power, goodnes, &amp; wisdom, shine gloriously in gouerning the world.Nor Love, nor Care, nor Powr, nor Providence. He prov'd his Power, by Making All of nought: His Diligence, by Ruling All he wrought: His Care, by Ending it in six Daies space: His Loue, in Building it for Adams Race: His Providence (maugre Times wastefull rages) Preseruing it so many Years and Ages. For, O! how often had this goodly Ball By his own Greatness caus'd his proper Fall? How often had his World deceast, except Gods mighty arms had it vpheld and kept? 2. In him, and through him, all things liue and moue, and haue their Beeing.God is the soule, the life, the strength, and sinnew, That quickens, moues, and makes this Frame continue. God's the main spring, that maketh every way All the small wheels of this great Engine play. God's the strong Atlas, whose vnshrinking shoulders Haue been and are Heav'ns heavy Globes vpholders. 3. All things particularly are guided by his Ordinance and Power, working continually.God makes the Fountaines run continually, The Daies and Nights succeed incessantly: The Seasons in their season he doth bring, Summer and Autumn, Winter, and the Spring: God makes th'Earth fruitfull, and he makes the Earth's Large loignes not yet faint for so many births. God makes the Sun and Stars, though wondrous hot, That yet their Heat themselues in flameth not; And that their sparkling beams prevent not so, With wofull flames, the Last great Day of wo: And that (as mov'd with a contrary wrest) They turn at-once both North, and East, and West: Heav'ns constant course, his heast doth never break: The floating Water waiteth at his beck: Th'Air's at his Call, the Fire at his Command, The Earth is His: and there is nothing fand In all these Kingdoms, but is mov'd each howr With secret touch of his eternall Powr. God is the Iudge, who keeps continuall Sessions, 4. God is the Iudge of the World: hauing all Creatures visible &amp; invisible, ready aimed to execute his Iudgements. In every place to punish all Transgressions; Who, voyd of Ignorance and Avarice, Not won with Bribes, nor wrested with Device, Sans Fear, or Favour; hate, or partiall zeal; Pronounceth Iudgements that are past appeal. Himselfe is Iudge, Iury, and Witness too, Well knowing what we all think, speak, or doo: He sounds the deepest of the doublest hart, Searcheth the Reins, and sifteth every part: Hee sees all secrets, and his Lynx-like ey (Yer it be thought) doth every thought descry: His Sentence given, never returns in vain; For, all that Heav'n, Earth, Aire, and Sea contain, Serue him as Sergeants: and the winged Legions, That soar aboue the bright Star-spangled Regions, Are ever prest, his powrfull Ministers: And (lastly) for his Executioners, Sathan, assisted with th'infernall band, Stands ready still to finish his Command. God (to be briefe) is a good Artizan That to his purpose aptly manage can Good or bad Tools; for, for iust punishment, Yea, he maketh euen the wicked his instruments to punish the wicked, and to proue his Chosen. He arms our sins vs sinners to torment: And to prevent th'vngodly's plot, somtime He makes his foes (will-nill-they) fight for him. Yet true it is, that humane things (seem) slide Vnbridledly with so vncertain tide, That in the Ocean of Events so many, Somtimes Gods Iudgements are scarce seen of any: Rather it seemes that giddy Fortune guideth Againe, against Epicures, who hold that all things happen in the World by Chance. All that beneath the silver Moon betideth. Yet, art thou ever iust (O God) though I Cannot (alas!) thy Iudgements depth descry: My wit's too shallow for the least Designe Of thy drad Counsails, sacred, and divine: And thy least-secret Secrets, I confess Too deep for vs, without thy Spirit's address. 1. Gods Iudgements, past our search: yet euer iust in th?selues.Yet oftentimes, what seemeth (at first sight) Vniust to vs, and past our reason quite, Thou mak'st vs (Lord) acknowledge (in due season) To haue been done with equitie and reason. Gen. 45. ve. 6.7 and Gen. 50. ve. 20.So, suffring th'Hebrew Tribes to sell their brother, Thy eternall Iustice thou didst seem to smother. But Ioseph (when, through such rare hap, it chanced Him of a slaue to be so high advanced, To rule the Land where Nilus fertill flood Dry Heav'ns defects endeuours to make good) Learn'd, that his envious brethrens treacherous drift, Him to the Stern of Memphian State had lift, That he might there provide Reliefe and Room For Abraham's Seed, against (then) time to com. 2. In executing his iudgements on the rebellious, be sheweth mercie on his Seruants.When thy strong arm, which plagues the Reprobate, The World and Sodom did exterminate, With flood and flame: because there liued then Some small remaines of good and righteous men, Thou seem'dst vniust: but when thou sauedst Lot From Fire, from Water Noah and his Boat, 'Twas plainly seen, thy Iustice stands propitious To th'Innocent, and smiteth but the vitious. 3. He sheweth his power in the confusion of the mightiest: and in the deliuerance of his Church.He wilfull winks against the shining Sun, That see's not Pharao, as a mean begun For th'Hebrews good; and that his hardned hart Smoothed the passage for their soon-depart: To th'end the Lord, when Tyrants will not yeeld, Might for his Glory finde the larger field. Who sees not also, that th'vniust Decree Of a proud Iudge, and Iudas treachery, The Peoples fury, and the Prelats gall, Serv'd all as organs to repair the Fall Of Edens old Prince, whose luxurious pride Made on his seed his sin for euer slide? 4. He turnes the malice of Satan and his instruments, to his own glory, and the good of his: of whom he hath alwaies speciall case.Th'Almighties Care, doth diuersly disperse Ore all the parts of all this Vniverse: But more precisely, his wide wings protect The race of Adam, chiefly his Elect. For, aye he watcheth for his Children choice, That lift to him their hearts, their hands, and voyce: For them, he built th'ay-turning Heav'ns Theater; For them, he made the Fire, Aire, Earth, and Water: He counts their hairs, their steps he measureth, Handles their hands, and speaketh with their breath; Dwels in their hearts, and plants his Regiments Of watchfull Angels round about their Tents. But heer, what hear I? Faith-less, God-less men, I maruell not, that you impugn my pen: But (O!) it grieues me, and I am amaz'd, A remedy for temptation of the godly, seeing the prosperity of the wicked, and the afflictions of Gods children. That those, whose faith, like glistering Stars haue blaz'd Even in our darkest nights, should so obiect Against a doctrine of so sweet effect; Because (alas!) with weeping eyes they see Th'vngodly-most in most Prosperitie, Clothed in Purple, crown'd with Diadems, Handling bright Scepters, hoording Gold and Gems, Croucht-to, and courted with all kinde affection, As priuiledged by the Heav'ns protection; So that, their goods, their honours, their delights Excell their hopes, exceed their appetites: And (opposite) the godly (in the storms Of this Worlds Sea) tost in continuall harms: In Earth, less rest then Euripus they finde, Gods heauy Rods still hanging them behinde: Them, shame, and blame, trouble and loss pursues; As shadows bodies, and as night the deawes. Peace, peace, deer friends: I hope to cancell quite The same c?forted in diuers sorts with apt Similitudes, confirming the reason, and declaring the right end of Gods diuers dealing with men. This profane thought from your vnsettled Sp'rit. Knowe then, that God (to th'end he be not thought A powr-less Iudge) heer plagueth many a fault; And many a fault leaues heer vnpunished, That men may also his last iudgment dread. On th'other side, note that the Crosse becomes A Ladder leading to Heav'ns glorious rooms: A Royall Path, the Heav'nly Milken way, Which doth the Saints to Ioues high Court convay. O! see you not, how that a Father graue, Curbing his Son much shorter then his Slaue, Doth th'one but rare, the other rife reproue, Th'one but for lucre, th'other all for loue? As skilfull Quirry, that commands the Stable Of some great Prince, or Person honourable, Giues oftest to that Horse the teaching Spur, Which he findes fittest for the vse of War. A painfull School-master, that hath in hand To institute the flowr of all a Land, Giues longest Lessons vnto those, where Heav'n The ablest wits and aptest wills hath giv'n. And a wise Chieftain neuer trusts the waight Of th'execution of a braue Exploit, But vnto those whom he most honoureth, For often proof of their firm force and faith: Such sends he first t'assault his eager foes; Such 'gainst the Canon on a Breach bestowes: Such he commands naked to scale a Fort, And with small number to re-gain a Port. Afflictions profitable to the Faithfull.God beats his Dear, from birth to buriall, To make them knowe him, and their pride appall, To draw deuout sighes from calamity, And by the touch to try their Constancy, T'awake their sloth, their mindes to exercise To trauell cheer'ly for th'immortall Prize. They are necessary to cure the diseases of the soule.A good Physician, that Arts excellence Can help with practice and experience, Applies discreetly all his Recipes Vnto the nature of each fell-disease; Curing this Patient with a bitter Potion, That, with strict Diet, th'other with a Lotion, And somtime cutteth off a leg or arm, So (sharply-sweet) to saue the whole from harm: Euen so the Lord (according to th'ill humours That vex his most-Saints with soule-tainting tumours) Sends somtimes Exile, somtimes lingring Languor, Somtimes Dishonour, somtimes pining Hunger, Somtimes long Law-suits, somtime Loss of good, Somtimes a Childes death, or a Widowhood: But ay he houldeth, for the good of His, In one hand Rods; in th'other, Remedies. Without them Gods children decline.The Souldier, slugging long at home in Peace, His wonted courage quickly doth decrease: The rust doth fret the blade hangd vp at rest: The Moath doth eat the garment in the Chest: The standing Water stinks with putrefaction: And Vertue hath no Vertue but in action. All that is fairest in the world, we finde Subiect to trauail. So, with storms and winde Th'Air still is tost: the Fire and Water tend, This, still to mount; that, euer to descend: The spirit is spright-less if it want discourse, Heav'n's no more Heav'n if it once cease his Course. The Crosse, an honorable mark.The valiant Knight is knowne by many scars: But he that steals-home wound-less, from the Wars, Is held a Coward, void of Valours proof, That for Deaths fear hath fled, or fought a-loof. God will be glorified in the constant sufferings of his Seruants.The Lord therefore, to giue Humanity Rare presidents of daunt-less Constancy, And crown his deer Sons with victorious Laurels Won from a thousand foes in glorious quarels; Pours down more euils on their hap-less head, Then yerst Pandora's odious Box did shead; Yet strengthning still their hearts with such a Plaister, That though the Flesh stoop, still the Spirit is Maister. There is nothing euill in Mans life, but sin: and vertue is best perceiued in the proofe.But, wrongly I these euils Euill call: Sole Vice is ill; sole Vertue good: and all, Besides the same, is selfly, simply, had And held indifferent, neither good nor bad. Let envious Fortune all her forces wage Against a constant Man, her fellest rage Can never change his godly resolution, Though Heav'n it self should threaten his confusion. A constant Man is like the Sea, whose brest True constancy liuely represented by two comparisons. Lies ever open vnto every guest; Yet all the Waters that she drinks, cannot Make her to change her qualities a iot: Or, like a good sound stomach, not soon casting For a light surfet, or a small distasting; But, that, vntroubled, can incontinent Convert all meats to perfect nourishment. Though then, the Lords deep Wisdom, to this day, God, Resting on the seuenth day, and blessing it; teacheth vs that in resting one day of the Week, we should principally employ it in his seruice: That we should cease from our worldly and wicked works, to giue place to his grace, and to suffer his Spirit to work in vs by the Instrument of his holy word. Work in the Worlds vncertain-certain Sway: Yet must we credit, that his hand compos'd All in six Dayes, and that He then Repos'd; By his example, giuing vs behest On the Seaventh Day for evermore to Rest. For, God remembred that he made not Man Of Stone, or Steel, or Brass Corinthian: But lodg'd our Soul in a frail earthen Mass, Thinner then Water, Brittler then the Glass: He knowes, our life is by nought sooner spent, Then hauing still our mindes and bodies bent. A Field, left lay for som few Years, will yield The richer Crop, when it again is till'd: A River, stopped by a sluce a space, Runs (after) rougher, and a swifter pase: A Bowe, awhile vnbent, will after cast His shafts the farther, and them fix more fast: A Souldier, that a season still hath lain, Coms with more fury to the Field again: Even so, this Body, when (to gather breath) One Day in Seav'n at Rest it soiourneth; It recollects his Powrs, and with more cheer Falls the next morrow to his first Career. But the chief End this Precept aims at, is To quench in vs the coals of Covetize; That, while we rest from all profaner Arts, Gods Spirit may work in our retired hearts: That we, down-treading earthly cogitations, May mount our thoughts to heav'nly meditations: Following good Archers guise, who shut one ey, Simile. That they the better may their mark espy. For by th'Almighty, this great Holy-day Against profaners of the Sabbath. Was not ordain'd to dance, to mask, and play, To slugg in sloth, and languish in delights, And loose the Reans to raging appetites: To turn Gods Feasts to filthy Lupercals, To frantick Orgies, and fond Saturnals: To dazle eys with Prides vain-glorious splendor, To serue strange gods, or our Ambition tender; As th'irreligion of loose Times hath since Chang'd the Prime-Churches chaster innocence. We ought on the Lords day att?d his seruice, and meditate on the euerlasting Rest, &amp; on the works of God.God would, that men should in a certain place This-Day assemble as before his face, Lending an humble and attentiue ear To learn his great Name's dear-drad Loving-Fear: He would, that there the faithfull Pastor should The Scriptures marrow from the bones vnfould, That we might touch with fingers (as it were) The sacred secrets that are hidden there. For, though the reading of those holy lines In private Houses som-what moue our mindes; Doubtless, the Doctrine preacht doth deeper pearce, Proves more effectuall, and more waight it bears. The practice of the faithfull, in all reformed Churches, on the Sabbath Day.He would, that there in holy Psalms we sing Shrill praise and thanks to our immortall King, For all the liberall bounties he bestow'th On vs and ours, in soule and body both: He would, that there we should confess his Christ Our onely Saviour, Prophet, Prince and Priest; Solemnizing (with sober preparation) His blessed Seals of Reconciliation: And, in his Name, beg bouldly what we need (After his will) and be assur'd to speed; Sith in th'Exchequer of his Clemency All goods of Fortune, Soule, and Body ly. The Corporall Rest, a figure of the Spirituall.He would, this Sabbath should a figure be Of the blest Sabbath of Eternity. But th'one (as Legall) heeds but outward things; Th'other to Rest both Soule and Body brings: Th'one but a Day endures; the others Date Eternity shall not exterminate: Shadows the one, th'other doth Truth include: This stands in freedom, that in seruitude: With cloudy cares th'one's muffled vp som-whiles; The others face is full of pleasing smiles: For, never grief, nor fear of any Fit Of the least care, shall dare com neer to it. 'Tis the grand Iubile, th'Feast of all Feasts, Sabbath of Sabbaths, end-less Rest of Rests; Which, with the Prophets, and Apostles zealous, The constant Martyrs, and our Christian Fellows, Gods faithfull Servants, and his chosen Sheep, In Heav'n we hope (within short time) to keep. He would this Day, our Soule (sequestered Meditations on the works of God, especially on the day of Rest. From busie thoughts of worldly cares) should read In Heav'ns bow'd Arches, and the Elements, His bound-less Bounty, Powr and Providence; That every part may (as a Master) teach Th'illiterate, Rules past a vulgar reach. Com (Reader) sit, com sit thee down by mee Exhortations to this Meditation, with the vse &amp; profit thereof. Think with my thoughts, and see what I do see: Hear this dumb Doctor: study in this Book, Where day and night thou maist at pleasure look, And thereby learn vprightly how to liue: For, every part doth speciall Lessons giue, Even from the gilt studs of the Firmament, To the Base Centre of our Element. Seest thou those Stars we (wrongly) Wandring call, The Planets teach vs to follow the will of God. Though divers wayes they dance about this Ball, Yet evermore their manifould Career Follows the Course of the First Mouing Sphear? This teacheth thee, that though thine own Desires Be opposite to what Heav'ns will requires, Thou must still striue to follow (all thy daies) God (the first Mover) in his holy waies. Vain puff of winde, whom vaunting pride bewitches, The Moon teacheth that we haue not any thing that we haue not receiued. For Bodies Beauties, or Mindes (richer) Riches; The Moon, whose splendor from her Brother springs, May by Example make thee vail thy wings: For thou, no less then the pale Queen of Nights, Borrow'st all goodnes from the Prince of Lights. Wilt thou, from Orb to Orb, to th'Earth descend? The Elementary fire and ours, where, our happiness, and where our misery consists. Behould the Fire which God did round extend: As neer to Heav'n, the same is cleer and pure; Ours heer belowe, sad, smoaky, and obscure: So, while thy Soule doth with the Heav'ns converse, It's sure and safe from every thought perverse; And though thou won heer in this world of sin, Thou art as happy as Heav'ns Angels bin: But if thy minde be alwayes fixed all On the foul dunghill of this darksom vale, It will partake in the contagious smells Of th'vnclean house wherein it droops and dwells. If envious Fortune be thy bitter foe, The Air, that afflictions are profitable for vs. And day and night doo toss thee to and fro; Remember, th'Air corrupteth soon, except With sundry Windes it oft be swing'd and swept. The Sea, which somtimes down to Hell is driv'n, The Sea, that we ought for no respect to transgress the the Law of God. And somtimes heaues a froathy Mount to Heav'n, Yet never breaks the bounds of her precinct, Wherein the Lord her boistrous arms hath linkt; Instructeth thee, that neither Tyrants rage, Ambition's windes, nor golden vassallage Of Avarice, nor any loue, nor fear, From Gods Command should make thee shrink a hair. The Earth, that we should bee constant.The Earth, which never all at once doth move, Through her rich Orb received, from above, No firmer base her burthen to sustent Then slippery props of softest Element; By her example doth propose to thee A needfull Lesson of true Constancy. The Ears of Corn, that we should be humble.Nay, there is nought in our dear Mother found, But pithily som Vertue doth propound. O! let the Noble, Wise, Rich, Valiant, Be as the base, poor, faint and ignorant: And, looking on the fields when Autumn shears, There let them learn among the bearded ears; Which still, the fuller of the flowry grain, Bow down the more their humble heads again; And ay the lighter and the less their store, They lift aloft their chaffie Crests the more. The Palm Tree, that we should bechaste.Let her, that (bound-less in her wanton wishes) Dares spot the Spouse-bed with vnlawfull kisses, Blush (at the least) at Palm-Trees loyalty, Which neuer bears vnless her Male be by. Cinnamon teacheth Diligence and Prudence.Thou, thou that prancest after Honors prize (While by the way thy strength and stomach dies) Remember, Honor is like Cinnamon, Which Nature mounds with many a million Of thorny pricks; that none may danger-less Approach the Plant, much less the Fruit possess. The Sun and the Marigold direct us unto Christ, the Sun of righteousnes.Canst thou the secret Sympathy behould Betwixt the bright Sun and the Marigould; And not consider, that we must no less Follow in life the Sun of righteousnes? O Earth! the Treasures of thy hollow brest Are no less fruitfull Teachers then the rest. For, as the Lime doth break and burn in Water, Lime in water, teacheth vnto shew our vertue in extremity.And swell, and smoak, crackle, and skip, and scatter; Waking that Fire, whose dull heat sleeping was Vnder the cold Crust of a Chalky Mass: He that (to march amid the Christian Hoast) Yeelds his hearts kingdom to the Holy-Ghost; And, for braue Seruice vnder Christ his Banner, Looks to be crown'd with his Chief Champions honor, Must in affliction wake his zeal, which oft In Calmer times sleeps too-securely soft. And, opposit, as the rich Diamond The Diam?d exhorts to constancy. The Fire and Steel doth stoutly both withstand: So the true Christian should, till life expire, Contemn proud Tyrants raging Sword and Fire. Or, if fell Rigour with som ruth-less smart A little shake the sinnews of his heart, He must be like the richest Minerall, Gold in the furnace to magnanimity &amp; purity. Whose Ingots bow, but never break at all; Nor in the Furnace suffer any loss Of waight, but Lees; not of the Gold, but dross. The pretious Stone, that bears the Rain-bowes name, The stone Iris, to edification of our Neighbour. Receiues the bright face of Sols burnisht flame; And by reflexion, after, it displaies On the next obiect all those pointed raies: So, whoso hath from the Empyreall Pole, Within the centre of his happy Soule, Receiv'd som splendor of the beams divine, Must to his Neighbour make the same to shine; Not burying Talents which our God hath giv'n To be employ'd in a rich trade for Heav'n, That in his Church he may receive his Gold With thirty, sixty, and an hundred fold. As th'Iron, toucht by th'Adamant's effect, The needle in the Marmers compass shewes that we should instantly look on Christ our only loadstar. To the North Pole doth ever point direct: So the Soule, toucht once by the secret powr Of a true liuely Faith, looks every howr To the bright Lamp which serues for Cynosure To all that sail vpon the Sea obscure. These presidents, from liue-less things collected, Lessons from liuing Creatures. Breed good effects in spirits well affected: But lessons, taken from the things that live, A liuelier touch vnto all sorts doo give. Vp, vp, ye Princes: Prince and People, rise, Bees, to Subiects and to Princes. And run to School among the Honey-Flies: There shall you learn, that an eternall law Subiects the Subiect vnder Princes aw: There shall you learn, that a courageous King To vex his humble Vassals hath no sting. The Persian Prince, that Princely did conclude The Marlin, to the vnthankful. So severe laws against Ingratitude, Knew that the Marlin, hauing kept her warm With a liue Lark, remits it without harm; And lest her friend-bird she should after slay, She takes her flight a quite contrary way. Fathers, if you desire, your Children sage The Eagle, to Parents. Should by their Blessings bless your crooked age; Train them betimes vnto true Vertues Lore By Aw, Instruction, and Example (more): So the old Eagle flutters in and out, To teach his yong to follow him about. If his example cannot timely bring His backward birds to vse their feeble wing, He leaues them then som dayes vnfed, whereby Sharp hunger may at length constrain them fly. If that prevail not, then he beats them, both With beak and wings, to stir their fearfull sloth. The Turtle, to Wedlock-breakers.You, that to haste your hated Spouses end, Black deadly poyson in his dish doo blend; O! can you see with vn-relenting eies The Turtle-Doue? sith, when her husband dies, Dies all her ioy: for, never loves she more; But on dry boughs doth her dead Spouse deplore. Wilde-geese, to Babblers.Thou, whom the freedom of a foolish tongue Brings oft in danger for thy neighbours wrong; Discreetly set a hatch before the door: As the wise Wilde-geese, when they over-soar Cicilian Mounts, within their bills doo bear A pebble-stone both day and night; for fear Lest rauenous Eagles of the North descry Their Armies passage, by their cackling Cry. Diuers Fishes, to vnnaturall Mothers, that will not nurse their own Children.O! Mothers, can you? can you (O vnkinde!) Deny your Babes your breasts? and call to minde That many Fishes many times are fain Receive their seed into their wombs again; Lucinas sad throes, for the self-same birth, Enduring oft, it often bringing forth. Dolphins, to the cruell.O! why embrace not we with Charity The living, and the dead with Piety? Giving these succour, sepulture to those: Even as the Dolphins do themselues expose, For their liue-fellows, and beneath the Wanes Cover their dead-ones vnder sandy Graues. The wilde Kid, to children.You Children, whom (past hope) the Heav'ns benignity Hath heapt with wealth, and heaved-vp to dignity, Doo not forget your Parents: but behould Th'officious Kids, who (when their Parents ould, With heavy Gyves, Elds trembling fever stops, And fetters-fast vpon the Mountain-tops) As carefull purveiours, bring them home to brouz The tendrest tops of all the slendrest boughs; And sip (self-thirst-less) of the Rivers brink, Which in their mouths they bring them home to drink. The Spiders, to Man and Wife.For House-hold Rules, read not the learned Writs Of the Stagirian (glory of good wits): Nor his, whom, for his hony-steeped stile, They Proverbiz'd the Attick Muse yer-while: Sith th'onely Spider teacheth every one The Husbands and the Huswifes function. For, for their food the valiant Male doth roam; The cunning Female tends her work at home: Out of her bowels wooll and yarn she spitteth, And all that else her learned labour fitteth: Her waight's the spindle that doth twist the twine, Which her small fingers draw so ev'n and fine. Still at the Centre she her warp begins, Then round (at length) her little threds she pins, And equall distance to their compass leaues: Then, neat and nimbly her new web she weaues, With her fine shuttle circularly drawn Through all the circuit of her open lawn; Open, lest else th'vngentle Windes should tear Her cipres Tent (weaker then any hair) And that the foolish Fly might easier get Within the meshes of her curious Net: Which he no sooner doth begin to shake, But straight the Male doth to the Centre make, That he may conquer more securely there The humming Creature hampred in his snare. You Kings (that bear the sword of iust Hostility) The Lion, to Kings. Pursue the Proud, and pardon true Humility; Like noble Lions that do neuer showe Their strength and stomach on a yeelding Foe, But rather through the stoutest throngs do forrage, 'Mid thousand Deaths to shew their daunt-less courage. Thou sluggard (if thou list to learn thy part) The Emmet and Hedge-hog to the slothfull. Go learn the Emmets and the Vrchins Art; In Summer th'one, in Autumn th'other takes The Seasons fruits, and thence provision makes, Each in his Lodging laying vp a hoord Against cold Winter, which doth nought affoord. But, Reader, we resemble one that windes Man may finde in himself excellent instructions. From Saba, Bandan, and the wealthy Indes (Through threatning Seas, and dangers manifold) To seek far-off for Incense, Spice and Gold; Sith we, not loosing from our proper Strand, Finde all wherein a happy life doth stand; And our own Bodies self-contained motions Giue the most gross a hundred goodly Notions. You Princes, Pastors, and ye Chiefs of War, The head teacheth all persons in authority. Do not your Laws, Sermons and Orders mar; Lest your examples banefull leprosies Infect your Subiects, Flocks, and Companies; Beware, your euill make not others like: For, no part's sound if once the Head be sick. The Eys instruct Princes and Noble-men.You Peers, O do not, through self-partiall zeale, With light-brain'd Counsels vex your Common-weal: But, as both Eys do but One thing behould, Let each his Countries common good vp-hould. The Teeth, such as trauell for others.You that for Others trauell day and night, With much-much labour, and small benefit, Behould the Teeth, which Toul-free grinde the food, From whence themselues do reap more grief then good. The Heart, the Ministers of the Word.Euen as the Heart hath not a Moments rest, But night and day moues in our panting brest, That by his beating it may still impart The lively spirits about to every part: So those, to whom God doth his Flock betake, Ought alwayes study, alwayes work, and wake, To breathe (by Doctrin and good Conversation) The quickning spirit into their Congregation. The Stomach, the same.And as the Stomach from the holesom food Diuides the grosser part (which is not good) They ought from false the truth to separate, Error from Faith, and Cockle from the Wheat, To make the best receiv'd for nourishment, The bad cast forth as filthy excrement. The Hands, all Christians to Charity.If Bat or Blade doo threaten sudden harm To belly, brest, or leg, or head, or arm, With dread-less dread the Hand doth ward the blowe, Taking herself her brethrens bleeding woe: Then 'mid the shock of sacrilegious Arms That fill the world with bloud and boistrous storms, Shall we not lend our helping hands to others, Whom Faith hath made more neer and dear then Brothers? The whole body, the whole society of mankinde, that euery one ought to stand in his own vocation.Nor can I see, where vnderneath the Sky A man may finde a iuster Policy, Or truer Image of a calme Estate Exempt from Faction, Discord and Debate, Then in th'harmonious Order that maintains Our Bodies life, through Members mutuall pains: Where, one no sooner feels the least offence, But all the rest haue of the same a sense. The Foot striues not to smell, the Nose to walk, The Tongue to combat, nor the Hand to talk: But, without troubling of their Common-weal With mutinies, they (voluntary) deal Each in his Office and Heav'n-pointed place, Be 't vile or honest, honoured or base. But, soft my Muse: what? wilt thou re-repeat The Little-Worlds admired Modulet? If twice or thrice one and the same we bring, 'Tis teadious; how-euer sweet we sing. Therefore a-shoar: Mates, let our Anchor fall: Heer blowes no Winde: heer are we Welcom all. Besides, consider and conceiue (I pray) W' haue row'd sufficient for a Sabbath Day.

Sonnet. From Zeal-Land, sayling with the Winde of Loue, In the Bark Labovr, steer'd by Theorems, Laden with Hope, and with Desire t'approue, Bound for Cape-Comfort in the Ile of Iemmes; In such a Mist wee fell vpon the Coast, That suddenly vpon the Rock Neglect (Vnhappily) our Ship and Goods we lost, Even in a Place that we did lease suspect. So, Cast-away (my Liege) and quight vn-don, We Orphan-remnants of a woefull Wrack, Heer cast a-shore, to Thee for succour run: O Pittie vs, for our deer Parent's sake; Who Honour'd Thee, both in his Life and Death, And to thy guard his Posthvmes did bequeath. 2.

Far be The Title of this tragick page From Thee (rare Module of Heroïk mindes) Whose noble Bountie all the Muses bindes To honour Thee; but mine doth most engage: And yet, to Thee, and to Thy Patronage (For present lack of other gratefull signes) Needs must I Offer these Decayed lines (Lyned with Horrors of Isaacian rage) Where-in, to keep decorum with my Theam, And with my Fortunes (ruin'd euery-way) My Care-clogd Muse (still carried down the stream) In singing Other's, sighes her Own Decay In stile, in state, in hap, in hope, in all: For, Vines, vnpropped, on the ground do craul. I. S. TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE the Earle of Essex, Earle Marshall of England, &amp;c. EDEN. Great Strong-bowe's heir, no self-conceipt doth cause Mine humble wings aspire to you, vnknowne: But, knowing this, that your renown alone (As th'Adamant, and as the Amber drawes: That, hardest steel; this, easie-yeelding strawes) Atterrs the stubborn, and attracts the prone: I haue presum'd (O Honors Paragon!) To graue your Name (which all Iberia awes) Heer, on the fore-front of this little Pile; T'inuite the vertuous to a sacred feast, And chase-away the vitious and the vile; Or stop their lothsom enuious tongues, at least. If I haue err'd, let my submission scuse: And daign to grace my yet vngraced Muse. I. S. TO THE SAME RIGHT Honourable Earle of ESSEX, &amp;c. THE ARK. From th'Ark of Hope, still tossed in distresse On th'angry Deluge of disastrous plight, My silly Doue heer takes her second flight, To view (great Lord) thy World of worthiness: Vouchsafe (rare Plant of perfect Nobleness) Som branch of safety, whereon she may light; Som Oliue leaf, that may presage me right A safe escape from this wet wilderness. So when the Flood of my deep cares shall fall, And, I be landed on sweet Comfort's Hill; First, my pure thoughts to Heav'n present I shall: Then on thy fauours meditating still, My Zealous Muse shall daily striue to frame Som fairer Tropheis to thy glorious Name. I. S. TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE Charles Lord Mount-ioy, Earle of Deuonshire. THE IMPOSTVRE. Though in thy Brook (great Charles) there swim a Swan, Whose happy, sweet, immortall tunes can raise The vertuous Greatness of thy Noble praise To higher notes, than my faint Numbers can; Yet, while thy Lucan doth in silence scan Vnto himselfe new meditated laies, To finish vp his sad Pharsalian fraies; Lend ear to Bartas (now our Country-man). For, though his English be not yet so good (As French-men hardly do our tongue attain) He hopeth yet to be well vnderstood; The rather, if you (worthy Lord) shall daign His bashfulness a little to aduance, With the milde fauours of your countenance. I. S. TO THE SAME RIGHT Honourable Earle of Deuonshire, &amp;c. THE HANDY-CRAFTS. The Mome-free Passage, that my Muse hath found Vnder Safe-Conduct of thy Patronage, Through carping Censures of this curious Age (Where high conceited happy wits abound) Makes her presume (O Mount-ioy, most Renownd!) To bear again, in her re-Pilgrimage, The noble Pasport of thy Tutelage, To salue her still from sullen Enuies wound. Let thy (true Eagle) Sun-beholding Eyes Glance on our Glowe-worme's scarce discerned spark: And while Witt's towring Falcons touch the skies, Obserue a while our tender-imped Lark. Such sparks may flame, and such light Larks may flie A higher pitch, than dross-full Vanity. I. S. TO THE SAME RIGHT Honourable the Earle of Deuonshire, &amp;c. THE COLONIES. Renowned Scipio, though thine Ennius Still merit best the best of thy regard: Though (worthily) his Trumpet be pre-ferr'd To sound the Triumphs thou hast won for vs; Yet sith one Pen, how-euer plentious (Were it the Mantuan or Meonian Bard) Suffizeth not to Giue Fame's full Reward To thy great Deeds, admir'd and glorious: Though Hee, thy Homer be; Thou, his Achilles; Both by Each other Happy: Thou (heer-in) T'haue such a Trump as his immortall Quill-is; Hee such a Theam as thy High Vertues bin: It shall (Great Worthy) no Dis-Honour be, That (English) Bartas hath Sung (thrice) to Thee. I. S. TO THE HONORABLE, learned, and religious Gentleman, Sir Peter Yovng of Seton, Knight, Almoner of Scotland, and one of his Maiesties Priuy Councell there. THE COLVMNS. Yovng, Ancient Seruant of our Soueraign Lord, Graue Master of thy Master's minor-yeares; Whose Prudence and whose Piety appeares In his Perfection, which doth thine record: Whose loyall Truth, His royall Trusts approue By oft Embassage to the greatest Peers: Whose Duty and Deuotion he endeers With present fauours of his Princely Loue: In Honour of these Honours many-fold, And for memoriall of Thy kinde regard Of these poor Orphanes (pyn'd in Hope-less cold) Accept these Thanks for thy firm Loues reward; Where-in (so Heav'ns prosper what we haue sung) Through euery Age thou shalt liue euer Yovng. I. S. TO THE RIGHT VERTVOVS (fauourer of Vertue, furtherer of Learning) Sir Thomas Smith (of London) Knight, (late) Lord Embassadour for his Maiesty, to the Emperour of Rvssia. IONAS. To thee, long tost in a fell Storm of State; Cast out, and swallowed in a Gulfe of Death, On false-suspect of thine vnspotted Faith, And flying from thy (Heav'n-giuen) Charge of late: For much resemblance of thy troublous Fate (Much like in Case to that he suffereth, Though (in effect) thy Cause far differeth) I send my Ionas; to congratulate Thy (happy) Rescue, and thy holy Triall: Where-by (as Fire doth purifie the Gold) Thy Loyaltie is more notorious Loyall, And worthy th'Honours which thou now doo'st hold. Thus, Vertue's Palms, oppressed, mount the more: And Spices, bruz'd, smell sweeter than before. I. S. TO THE MOST HONORABLE, learned, and religious Gent. M?. Anthony Bacone. THE FVRIES. Bound by thy Bounty, and mine own Desire, To tender still new Tribute of my Zeal To Thee, whose fauour did the first repeal My proto-Bartas from Self-doomed Fire: Hauing new tuned to du Bartas Lyre, These tragick murmurs of his Fvries fell, Which (with the Horrors of an Earthly Hell) The Sin-curst life of wretched Mortals tire: To whom, but Thee, should I present the same? Sith, by the Breath of Thine incouragement, My sacred-fury thou didst first inflame To prosecute This sacred Argument. Such as it is, accept it, as a signe Of Thankfull Loue, from Him, whose all is Thine. I. S. TO THE SAME MOST Honourable Gentleman, Master Anthony Bacone. BABYLON. Thy friendly censure of my first Essaie (Du Bartas Fvries, and his Babylon) My faint Endeuours hath so cheared on, That both His Weeks are also Ours, to-day. Thy gracious hand, repriuing from decay My fame-less Name doom'd to obliuion, Hath so stirr'd-vp my Soule's deuotion, That in my Songs thy Name shall liue for ay. Thy milde acceptance of my simple myte (Pattern and Patron of all vertuous drifts) Doth heer againe my gratefull Muse inuite To re-salute thee with mine humble gifts; Indeed, no Gifts, but Debts to Thy desart: To whom I owe my hand, my head, my heart. I. S. ADAM. THE FIRST DAY OF THE SECOND WEEK; Containing I. Eden, II. The Impostvre, III. The Fvries, IV. The Handy-Crafts. Eden. THE FIRST PART OF THE FIRST DAY OF THE II. WEEK. The Argvment. Our Poet, first, doth Gods assistance seek: The Scope and Subiect of his Second Week. Adam in Eden: Edens beauties rare; A reall Place, not now discerned where: The Tree of Life; and Knowledge-Tree withall: Knowledge of Man, before and since his Fall: His exercise, and excellent Delights, In's Innocence: of Dreams and Ghostly Sights: Nice Questions curb'd: Death, Sins effect; whereby Man (else Immortall) mortall now, must Dy. Great God, which hast this World's Birth made me see, Inuocation of the true God, for assistance in Description of the Infancy &amp; first estate of the World. Vnfold his Cradle, shew his Infancy: Walke thou, my Spirit, through all the flowring alleys Of that sweet Garden, where through winding valleys Foure liuely floods crauld: tell me what mis-deed Banisht both Edens, Adam and his seed: Tell who (immortall) mortalizing, brought-vs The Balm from heav'n which hoped health hath wrought-vs: Grant me the story of thy Church to sing, And gests of Kings: Let me this Totall bring From thy first Sabbath to his fatall toomb, My stile extending to the Day of Doome. Lord, I acknowledge and confess, before, This Ocean hath no bottom, nor no shore; But (sacred Pilot) thou canst safely steer My vent'rous Pinnasse to her wished Peer; Where once arriv'd, all dropping wet I will Extoll thy fauours, and my vows fulfill. The Translator, c?sidering his own weakness and insufficiency for a Work so rare &amp; excellent, as all the World hath worthily admired: craueth also the assistance of the Highest, that (at least) his endeuour may both stir-vp som abler Spirit to vndertake this Task; &amp; also prouoke all other good Wits to take in hand som holy Argument: and with-all, that Himselfe may be for euer sincerely affected, and (as it were) throughly seasoned with the sweet relish of these sacred &amp; religious discourses.And gratious Guide, which doost all grace infuse, Since it hath pleas'd thee task my tardy Muse With these high Theames that through mine Art-less Pen This holy Lamp may light my Country-men: Ah, teach my hand, touch mine vnlearned lips; Lest, as the Earths grosse body doth Eclipse Bright Cynthia's beames, when it is interpos'd 'Twixt her and Phœbus: so mine ill-dispos'd, Dark gloomy Ignorance obscure the rayes Of this diuine Sun of these learned dayes. O! furnish me with an vn-vulgar stile, That I by this may wain our wanton Ile From Ouids heirs, and their vn-hallowed spell Heer charming senses, chaining soules in Hell. Let this prouoke our modern Wits to sacre Their wondrous gifts to honour thee, their Maker: That our mysterious ELFINE Oracle, Deep, morall, graue, Inventions miracle; My deer sweet Daniel, sharp conceipted, brief, Ciuill, sententious, for pure accents chief: And our new Naso that so passionates Th'heroike sighes of loue-sick Potentates: May change their subiect, and aduance their wings Vp to these higher and more holy things. And if (sufficient rich in self-inuention) They scorn (as I) to liue of Strangers Pension, Let them deuise new Weeks, new works, new wayes To celebrate the supreme Prince of praise. Simile.And let not me (good Lord) be like the Lead Which to som Citie from som Conduit-head Brings holsom water; yet (self-wanting sense) It selfe receiues no drop of comfort thence: But rather, as the thorough-seasoned But Simile.Wherein the tears of death-prest Grapes are put, Retains (long after all the wine is spent) Within it selfe the liquors liuely sent: Let me still sauour of these sacred sweets Till Death fold-vp mine earth in earthen sheets; Lest, my young layes, now prone to preach thy glory To Brvtvs heyrs, blush at mine elder Story. Narration. God, hauing treated &amp; established Man Lord of the creatures, lodgeth him in the fair Garden of Eden. God (supreme Lord) committed not alone T'our Father Adam, this inferiour Throne; Ranging beneath his rule the scaly Nation That in the Ocean haue their habitation: Those that in horror of the Desarts lurk: And those that capering in the Welkin work; But also chose him for a happy Seat A climate temperate both for cold and heat, Which dainty Flora paveth sumptuously With flowry Ver's inameld tapistry; Pomona pranks with fruits, whose taste excels; And Zephyr fils with Musk and Amber smels: Where God himself (as Gardner) treads the allies, With Trees and Corn covers the hils and vallies, Summons sweet sleep with noyse of hundred Brooks, And Sun-proof Arbours makes in sundry nooks: He plants, he proins, he pares, he trimmeth round Th'ever green beauties of a fruitfull ground; Heer-there the course of th'holy Lakes he leads, With thousand Dies hee motleys all the meades. Ye Pagan Poets that audaciously The Elysian Fields of the Heathen Poets are but Dreams. Haue sought to dark the ever Memory Of Gods greeat works; from henceforth still be dum Your fabled prayses of Elysium, Which by this goodly module you haue wrought, Through deaf tradition, that your Fathers taught: For, the Almighty made his blisfull Bowrs Better indeed, then you haue fained yours. For, should I say that still, with smiling face, A large Description of the rich beauties of the Garden of Eden or earthly Paradise. Th'all-clasping Heav'ns beheld this happy place; That honey sweet, from hollow rocks did drain; That fostring milk flow'd vp and down the Plain; That sweet as Roses smelt th'ill-savory Rew: That in all soyls, all seasons, all things grew: That still there dangled on the self-same treen A thousand fruits, nor over-ripe, nor green: That egrest fruits, and bitterest hearbs did mock Madera Sugars, and the Apricock; Yeelding more holesom food then all the messes, That now taste-curious, wanton Plenty dresses, Disguising (in a thousand costly dishes) The various store of dainty Fowls and Fishes, Which far and neer wee seek by Land and Seas, More to provoke then hunger to appease; Or should I say, each morning, on the ground Excellent estate of the Earth, &amp; especially of Eden before Adams fall. Not common deaw, but Manna did abound: That never gutter-gorging durty muds Defil'd the crystall of smooth-sliding floods, Whose waters past, in pleasant taste, the drink That now in Candia decks Cerathus brink: That shady Groves of noble Palm-tree sprays, Of amorous Myrtles, and immortall Bays Never vn-leav'd; but evermore, their new Self-arching arms in thousand Arbours grew: Where thousand sorts of birds, both night and day, Did bill and woo, and hop about, and play; And, marrying their sweet tunes to th'Angels layes, Sung Adams bliss and their great Makers prayse. For then, the Crowes, night-Rav'ns, and Howlets noise Was like the Nightingals sweet-tuned voyce; And Nightingals sung like divine Arion, Like Thracian Orpheus, Linus, and Amphion. Th'Aire's daughter Eccho, haunting woods among; A blab that will not (cannot) keep her tongue, Who never asks, but onely answers all, Who lets not any her in vain to call; She bore her part; and full of curious skill, They ceasing sung, they singing ceased still: There Musick raign'd, and ever on the Plain, A sweet sound rais'd the dead-liue voyce again. All discommodities far from Eden before Sin.If there I say the Sun (the Seasons stinter) Made no hot Sommer, nor no hoary Winter, But louely Ver kept still in liuely lustre The fragrant Valleys smiling Meads, and Pasture: That boistrous Adams body did not shrink For Northren windes, nor for the Southren wink: But Zephyr did sweet musky sighes afford, Which breathing through the Garden of the Lord, Gaue bodies vigour, verdure to the field, That verdure flowrs, those flowrs sweet savor yeeld: That Day did gladly lend his sister, Night, For half her moisture, half his shining Light: That never hail did Harvest preiudice, That never frost, nor snowe, nor slippery ice The fields en-ag'd: nor any stormy stowr Dismounted Mountains, nor no violent showr Poverisht the Land, which frankly did produce All fruitfull vapours for delight and vse: I think I ly not, rather I confess Edens principal and most excellent beauty.My stammering Muses poore vnlearnedness. If in two words thou wilt her praise comprise, Say 't was the the type of th'vpper Paradise; Where Adam had (O wondrous strange!) discourse With God himself, with Angels intercourse. Of the place where the Garden of Eden was situate.Yet (over-curious) question not the site, Where God did plant this Garden of delight: Whether beneath the Equinoctiall line, Or on a Mountain neer Latona's shine, Nigh Babylon, or in the radiant East. Humble content thee that thou know'st (at least) That, that rare, plentious, pleasant, happy thing Whereof th'Almighty made our Grand-sire King, Was a choyce soil, through which did rowling slide Swift Ghion, Pishon, and rich Tigris tyde, And that fair stream whose silver waues do kiss The Monarch Towrs of proud Semiramis. Now, if that (roaming round about the earth) It was a certain materiall Place, howsoeuer now a-dayes, we can exactly obserue neither the Circuit, nor extent of it. Thou finde no place that answers now in worth This beautious place, nor Country that can showe Where now-adayes, those noted flouds do flowe: Include not all within this Close confin'd, That labouring Neptunes liquid Belt doth binde. A certaine place it was (now sought in vain) Where set by grace, for sin remov'd again, Our Elders were: whereof the thunder-darter Made a bright Sword the gate, an Angel Porter. Nor think that Moses paints, fantastik-wise, It was no allegoricall nor mysticall Garden. A mystike tale of fained Paradise: ('Twas a true Garden, happy Plenties horn, And seat of graces) least thou make (forlorn) An Ideall Adams food fantasticall, His sinne suppos'd, his pain Poeticall: Such Allegories serue for shelter fit To curious Idiots of erronious wit; And chiefly then, when reading Histories, Seeking the spirit, they do the body leese. But if thou list to ghesse by likelyhood, It was defaced by the generall Flood. Think that the wreakfull nature-drowning flood Spar'd not this beautious place, which formost saw The first foul breach of Gods eternall law: Think that the most part of the plants it pull'd, And of the sweetest flowrs the spirits dull'd, Spoild the fair Gardens, made the fat fields lean, And chang'd (perchance) the rivers chanell clean: Why the Situation of the Garden of Eden is now hard to finde. And thinke, that Time (whose slippery wheel doth play In humane causes with inconstant sway, Who exiles, alters, and disguises words) Hath now transform'd the names of all these Fordes, For, as through sin we lost that place, I feare (Forgetfull) we haue lost the knowledge where 'T was situate, and of the sugred dainties Wherewith God fed vs in those sacred plenties. Now of the Trees wherewith th'immortall Powr Of the two Trees seruing as Sacraments to Adam. Adorn'd the quarters of that blisfull Bowr, All serv'd the mouth, saue two sustaind the minde: All serv'd for food, saue two for seals assign'd. God gaue the first, for honourable stile, Wherof the Tree of Life was a Sacrament. The tree of Life: true name; (alas the while!) Not for th'effect it had, but should haue kept, If Man from duty never had mis-stept. For, as the ayr of those fresh dales and hils Preserued him from Epidemick ills, This fruit had ever-calm'd all insurrections, All civill quarrels of the crosse complexions; Had barr'd the passage of twice-childish age, And ever-more excluded all the rage Of painfull griefes, whose swift-slowe posting-pase At first or last our dying life doth chase. The excellency of that Tree.Strong counter-bane! O sacred Plant divine! What metall, stone, stalk fruit, flowr, root, or ryne, Shall I presume in these rude rymes to sute Vnto thy wondrous World-adorning Fruit? The rarest Simples that our fields present-vs Heale but one hurt, and healing too torment-vs: And with the torment, lingring our reliefe, Our bags of Gold void, yer our bulks of griefe. But thy rare fruits hid powr admired most, Salveth all sores, sans pain, delay, or cost: Or rather, man from yawning Death to stay, Thou didst not cure, but keep all ils away. We cannot say what Tree it was.O holy, peer-less, rich preservatiue! Whether wert thou the strange restoratiue That suddenly did age with youth repair, And made old Æson younger then his heir? Or holy Nectar, that in heav'nly bowrs, Eternally self-pouring Hebé pours? Or blest Ambrosia (Gods immortall fare)? Or else the rich fruit of the Garden rare, Where, for three Ladies (as assured guard) A fire-arm'd Dragon day and night did ward? Or pretious Moly, which Ioues Pursuiuan Wing-footed Hermes brought to th'Ithacan? Or else Nepenthe, enemy to sadness, Repelling sorrows, and repealing gladness? Or Mummie? or Elixir (that excels Saue men and Angels every creature els)? No, none of these: these are but forgeries, But toyes, but tales, but dreams, deceipts, and lies. But thou art true, although our shallow sense May honour more, then sound thine Excellence. Of the Tree of Knowledge of Good &amp; Euill. The Tree of Knowledge, th'other Tree behight: Not that it selfly had such speciall might, As mens duls wits could whet and sharpen so That in a moment they might all things knowe. 'Twas a sure pledge, a sacred signe, and seal; Which, being ta'n, should to light man reveal What ods there is between still peace, and strife; Gods wrath, and loue; drad death, and dearest life; Solace, and sorrow; guile, and innocence; Rebellious pride, and humble obedience. For, God had not depriv'd that primer season Of the excellence of mans knowledge before Sin. The sacred lamp and light of learned Reason: Mankinde was then a thousand fould more wise Then now: blinde Error had not bleard his eyes, With mists which make th'Athenian Sage suppose That nought he knowes saue this, that nought he knowes. That even light Pirrhons wavering fantasies Reaue him the skill his vn-skill to agnize. And th'Abderite, within a Well obscure, As deep as dark, the Truth of things immure. He (happy) knew the Good, by th'vse of it: How he knew good and euill before Sin. He knew the Bad, but not by proof as yet: But as hey say of great Hippocrates, Who (though his limbs were numm'd with no excess, Nor stopt his throat, nor vext his fantasie) Knew the cold Cramp, th'Angine and Lunacy, And hundred els-pains, whence in lusty flowr He liv'd exempt a hundred yeers and foure. Or like the pure Heav'n-prompted Prophets rather, Whose sight so cleerly future things did gather, Because the World's Soule in their soule enseal'd The holy stamp of secrets most conceal'd. But our now-knowledge hath, for tedious train, Of mans knowledge since his Fall. A drooping lise, and over-racked brain, A face forlorn, a sad and sullen fashion, A rest-less toyl, and Cares self-pining passion. Knowledge was then even the soules soule for light, The spirits calm Port, and Lanthorn shining bright To straight-stept feet: cleer knowledge; not confus'd: Not sowr, but sweet: not gotten, but infus'd. Now Heav'ns eternall all-fore-seeing King, Who never rashly ordereth any thing, Thought good, that man (hauing yet spirits sound-stated) Why the Lord put man in the Garden of Eden. Should dwell els-where, then where he was created; That he might knowe, he did not hold this place By Natures right, but by meer gift and Grace; That he should never taste fruits vn-permitted, But keep the sacred Pledge to him committed, And dress that Park, which, God without all tearm, On these conditions gaue him, as in farm. God would, that (void of painfull labour) he Of his exercise there. Should liue in Eden; but not idlely: For, Idleness pure Innocence subverts, Defiles our body, and our soule perverts: Yea, sobrest men it makes delicious, To vertue dull, to vice ingenious. But that first trauell had no sympathy With our since-trauails wretched cruelty, Distilling sweat, and panting, wanting winde, Which was a scourge for Adams sin assign'd. 4. Comparisons.For, Edens earth was then so fertile fat, That he made onely sweet Essayes, in that, Of skilfull industry, and naked wrought More for delight, then for the gain he sought. In briefe, it was a pleasant exercise, A labour lik't, a paine much like the guise 1.Of cunning dauncers; who, although they skip, Run, caper, vault, trauerse, and turn, and trip, From Morn till Even, at night again full merry, Renew their dance, of dancing never weary. 2.Or else of Hunters, that with happy luck Rousing betimes som often breathed Buck, Or goodly Stagge, their yelping Hounds vncouple, Winde lowd their horns, their whoops and halloos double, Spur-on and spare not, following their desire, Themselues vn-weary, though their Hackneys tyre. But, for th'end of all their iolity, There's found much stifness, sweat and vanity. I rather match it to the pleasing pain 3.Of Angels pure, who ever sloath disdain: 4.Or to the Suns calm course, who pain-less ay About the welkin posteth night and day. Adam admires the beauties of the World in generall.Doubtless, when Adam saw our common aire, He did admire the mansion rich and faire Of his Successors. For, frosts keenly cold The shady locks of Forrests had not powl'd: Heav'n had not thundred on our heads as yet, Nor given the Earth her sad Diuorces Writ. But most especially of the Garden of Eden.But when he once had entred Paradise, The remnant world he iustly did despise: [Much like a Boor far in the Countrey born, Who, never having seen but Kine and Corn, Oxen, and Sheep and homely Hamlets thatcht (Which, fond, he counts as kingdomes; hardly matcht) In this comparison my Author setteth down the famous Citie of Paris: but I haue presumed to apply it to our own City of London, that it might be more familiar to my meere English &amp; vn-trauaild Readers. When afterward he happens to behold Our wealthy London's wonders manifold, The silly peasant thinks himselfe to be In a new World; and gazing greedily, One while he Art-less, all the Arts admires, Then the Fair Temples, and their top-less spires, Their firm foundations, and the massie pride Of all their sacred ornaments beside: Anon he wonders at the differing graces, Tongues, gests, attires, the fashions and the faces, Of busie buzzing swarms, which still he meets Ebbing and flowing ouer all the streets; Then at the signes, the shops, the waights, the measures, The handy-crafts, the rumours trades, and treasures. But of all sights, none seems him yet more strange Then the rare, beautious, stately, rich Exchange. Another while he maruails at the Thames, Which seems to bear huge mountains on her streams: Then at the fur-built Bridge; which he doth iudge More like a tradefull Citie then a Bridge; And glancing thence a-long the Northren shore, That princely prospect doth amaze him more.] For in that Garden man delighted so, That (rapt) he wist not if he wak't or no; If he beheld a true thing or a fable; Or Earth, or Heav'n: all more then admirable. For such excess his extasie was small: Not having spirit enough to muse withall, He wisht him hundred-fold redoubled senses, The more to taste so rare sweet excellences; Not knowing, whether nose, or ears, or eyes, Smelt, heard, or saw, more sauours, sounds, or Dies. But, Adams best and supreame delectation, Happiness of the first Man before his sail. Was th'often haunt and holy conversation His soule and body had so many wayes With God, who lightned Eden with his Rays. For spirits, by faith religiously refin'd, 'Twixt God and man retain a middle kinde: And (Vmpires) mortall to th'immortall ioyne; And th'infinite in narrow clay confine. Som-times by you, O you all-faining Dreams, Of the visions of the spirit. We gain this good; but not when Bacchus streames And glutton vapours over-flowe the Brain, And drown our spirits, presenting fancies vain: Nor when pale Phlegm, or Saffron coloured Choler, In feeble stomacks belch their divers dolor, And print vpon our Vnderstandings Tables; That, Water-wracks; this other, flamefull fables: Nor when the Spirit of lies, our spirits deceiues, And guilefull visions in our fancy leaues: Nor when the pencill of Cares ouer-deep Our day-bred thoughts depainteth in our sleep. But when no more the soules chiefe faculties, Are sperst to serue the bodie many waies, When all self-vned, free from days disturber, Through such sweet Transe, she findes a quiet harbour; Where som in riddles, som more plain exprest, She sees things future, in th'almighties brest. Of the certainty of the visions of the spirit, the body beeing at rest.And yet far higher is this holy Fit, When (not from flesh, but from flesh cares, acquit) The wakefull soule it selfe assembling so, All selfly dies; while that the body though Liues motion-less: for, sanctified wholly, It takes th'impression of Gods Signet solely; And in his sacred Crystall Map, doth see Heav'ns Oracles, and Angels glorious glee: Made more then spirit, Now, Morrow, Yesterday, To it, all one, are all as present ay. And though it seem not (when the dream's expir'd) Like that it was; yet is it much admir'd Of rarest men, and shines among them bright Like glistering Stars, through gloomy shades of night. Of diuine &amp; extraordinary visions and Reuelations.But aboue all, that's the divinest Transe, When the soules eye beholdes Gods countenance; When mouth to mouth familiarly he deales, And in our face his drad-sweet face he seales. As when S. Paul on his deer Masters wings, Was rapt aliue vp to th'eternall things: And he that whilom for the chosen flock, Made wals of waters, waters of a rock. Of the excellency of such visi?s &amp; Reuelations.O sacred flight! sweet rape! loues soverain bliss! Which very loues deer lips dost make vs kiss: Hymen, of Manna, and of Mel compact, Which for a time dost Heav'n with Earth contract: Fire, that in Limbeck of pure thoughts divine Doost purge our thoughts, and our dull earth refine: And mounting vs to Heav'n, vn-moving hence, Man (in a trice) in God doost quintessence: O! mad'st thou man divine in habitude, As for a space; O sweetest solitude, Thy bliss were equall with that happy Rest Which after death shall make vs ever-blest. What manner of visions the first Man had in Eden.Now, I beleeue that in this later guise Man did converse in Pleasant Paradise With Heav'ns great Architect, and (happy) there His body saw, (or bodie as it were) Gloriously compast with the blessed Legions That raign aboue the azure-spangled Regions. Man is put in possession of Eden, vnder a condition. Adam, quoth He, the beauties manyfold That in this Eden thou doest heer behold, Are all thine, onely: enter (sacred Race) Come, take possession of this wealthy place, The Earth's sole glory: take (deer Son) to thee, This Farm's demains, leaue the Chief right to me; And th'only Rent that of it I reserue, is One Trees fair fruit, to shew thy sute and service: Be thou the Liege, and I Lord Paramount, I'le not exact hard fines (as men shall woont). For signe of Homage, and for seal of Faith, Of all the profits this Possession hath, I onely aske one Tree; whose fruit I will For Sacrament shall stand of Good and Ill. Take all the rest, I bid thee: but I vow By th'vn-nam'd name, where-to all knees doo bow, And by the keen Darts of my kindled ire (More fiercely burning then consuming fire) That of the Fruit of Knowledge if thou feed, Death, dreadfull Death shall plague Thee and thy Seed. If then, the happy state thou hold'st of me, My holy mildness, nor high Maiesty, If faith nor Honour curb thy bold ambition, Yet weigh thy self, and thy owne Seeds condition. Most mighty Lord (quoth Adam) heer I tender Before Sin, Man was an humble and zealous seruant of God. All thanks I can, not all I should thee render For all thy liberall fauours, far surmounting My hearts conceit, much more my tongues recounting. At thy command, I would with boyst'rous shock Go run my selfe against the hardest rock: Or cast me headlong from som Mountain steep, Down to the whirling bottom of the Deep: Yea, at thy beck, I would not spare the life Of my deer Phœnix, sister-daughter-wife: Obeying thee, I finde the things impossible, Cruell, and painfull; pleasant, kinde, and possible. But since thy first Law doth more grace afford Vnto the Subiect, then the soverain Lord: Since (bountious Prince) on me and my Descent, Thou doost impose no other tax, nor Rent, But one sole Precept, of most iust condition (No Precept neither, but a Prohibition); And since (good God) of all the fruits in Eden Ther's but one Apple that I am forbidden, Even only that which bitter Death doth threat, (Better, perhaps, to look on then to eat) I honour in my soule, and humbly kiss Thy iust Edict (as Author of my bliss): Which, once transgrest, deserues the rigor rather Of sharpest Iudge, then mildness of a Father. The Firmament shall retrograde his course, Swift Euphrates goe hide him in his source, Firm Mountains skip like Lambs; beneath the Deep Eagles shall diue; Whales in the ayr shall keep, Yer I presume, with fingers ends to touch (Much less with lips) the Fruit forbod so much. Description of the beauties of the Garden of Eden.Thus, yet in league with Heav'n and Earth, he liues; Enioying all the Goods th'Almighty giues: And, yet not treading Sins false mazy measures, Sails on smooth surges of a Sea of pleasures. Heer, vnderneath a fragrant Hedge reposes, Full of all kindes of sweet all-coloured Roses, Which (one would think) the Angels daily dress In true-loue-knots, tri-angles, lozenges. The Orchard.Anon he walketh in a levell lane On either side beset with shady Plane, Whose arched boughs, for Frize and Cornich bear Thick Groues, to shield from future change of air: Then in a path impal'd, in pleasant wise, With sharp-sweeet Orange, Limon, Citron trees; Whose leauy twigs, that intricately tangle, Seem painted wals whereon true fruits do dangle. Now in a plentious Orchard planted rare With vn-graft trees, in checker, round and square: Whose goodly fruits so on his will doe wait, That plucking one, another's ready straight: And having tasted all (with due satiety) Findes all one goodness, but in taste variety. The Brooks.Anon he stalketh with an easie stride, By som cleer River's lilly-paved side, Whose sand's pure gold, whose pebbles pretious Gemms, And liquid silver all the curling streams: Whose chiding murmur, mazing in and out, With Crystall cisterns moats a mead about: The Bridges.And th'art-less Bridges, over-thwart this Torrent, Are rocks self-arched by the eating current: Or loving Palms, whose lusty Femals willing Their marrow-boyling loues to be fulfilling, (And reach their Husband-trees on th'other banks) Bow their stiff backs, and serue for passing-planks. The Alleis, Beds and Borders.Then in a goodly Garden's alleys smooth Where prodig Nature sets abroad her booth Of richest beauties, where each bed and border Is like pide posies divers dies and order. The Caues.Now, far from noise, he creepeth covertly Into a Caue of kindly Porphyry, Which, rock-fall'n spowts, congeald by colder air, Seem with smooth anticks to haue seeled fair: There laid at ease, a cubit from the ground, Vpon a Iaspir fring'd with yvie round, Purfled with veins, thick thrumm'd with mossie Bever, Hee falls asleep fast by a silent River; The pleasant murmur of the Waters.Whose captiue streams, through crooked pipes still rushing, Make sweeter Musick with their gentle gushing, Then now at Tiuoli, th'Hydrantick Braul Of rich Ferrara's stately Cardinall: Or Ctesibes rare engins, framed there Whereas they made of Ibts, Iupiter. Musing, anon through crooked Walks he wanders, The Maze. Round-winding rings, and intricate Meanders, Fals-guiding paths, doubtfull beguiling strays, And right-wrong errors of an end-less Maze: Not simply hedged with a single border Of Rosemary, cut-out with curious order, In Satyrs, Centaurs Whales, and half-men-Horses, And thousand other counterfaited corses; The wonderfull Plants. But with true Beasts, fast in the ground still sticking, Feeding on grass, and th'airy moisture licking: Such as those Bonarets, in Scythia bred The Bonarets. Of slender seeds, and with green fodder fed; Although their bodies, noses, mouthes and eys, Of new-yeand Lambs haue full the form and guise; And should be very Lambs, saue that (for foot) Within the ground they fix a liuing root, Which at their nauell growes, and dies that day That they haue brouz'd the neighbour-grass away. O wondrous vertue of God onely good! The Beast hath root, the Plant hath flesh and blood: The nimble Plant can turn it to and fro; Then numméd Beast can neither stir nor go: The Plant is leaf-less, branch-less, void of fruit; The Beast is lust-less, sex-less, fire-less, mute: The Plant with Plants his hungry panch doth feed; Th'admired Beast is sowen a slender seed. Then vp and down a Forrest thick he paseth; The Trees of the Garden of Eden. Which, selfly op'ning in his presence, baseth Her trembling tresses never-vading spring, For humble homage to her mighty King: Where thousand Trees, waving with gentle puffs Their plumy tops, sweep the celestiall roofs: Yet envying all the massie Cerbas fame, The Cerbas. Sith fifty pases can but clasp the same. There springs the Shrub three foot aboue the grass, The Balm. Which fears the keen edge of the Curtelace, Whereof the rich Egyptian so endears Root, bark and fruit, and much-much more the tears. There liues the Sea-Oak in a little shel; The Sea Oak. There growes vntill'd the ruddy Cochenel: The Cochenel. And there the Chermez, which on each side Arms The Chermez. With pointed prickles all his precious arms; Rich Trees, and fruitfull in those Worms of Price, Which pressed, yeeld a crimsin-coloured juyce, Whence thousand Lambs are died so deep in grain, That their own Mothers knowe them not again. The admirarable Melt.There mounts the Melt, which serues in Mexico For weapon, wood, needle, and threed (to sowe) Brick, hony, sugar, sucket, balm and wine, Parchment, perfume, apparell, cord and line: His wood for fire, his harder leaues are fit For thousand vses of inventiue wit. Somtimes thereon they graue their holy things, Laws, lauds of Idols, and the gests of Kings: Somtimes, conioyned by a cunning hand, Vpon their roofs for rowes of tile they stand: Somtimes they twine them into equall threeds; Small ends make needles; greater, arrow-heads: His vpper sap the sting of Serpents cures: His new-sprung bud a rare Conserue indures: His burned stalks, with strong fumosities Of pearcing vapours, purge the French disease: And they extract, from liquor of his feet, Sharp vinegar pure hony, sugar sweet. The shame faced.There quakes the Plant, which in Pudefetan Is call'd the Sham-faç't: for, asham'd of man, If towards it one doo approach too much, It shrinks his boughs, to shun our hatefull touch; As if it had a soule, a sense, a sight, Subiect to shame, fear, sorrow and despight. A Tree whose leaues tr?sform to fowl and fish.And there, that Tree from off whose trembling top Both swimming shoals, and flying troops doo drop: I mean the Tree now in Iuturna growing, Whose leaues, disperst by Zephyr's wanton blowing, Are metamorphos'd both in form and matter; On land to Fowls, to Fishes in the water. A modest correct on of our Poe vnwilling to wade, urthee in curtous search of hidden secrets.But, seest thou not (dear Muse) thou treadst the same Too-curious path thou dost in others blame? And striv'st in vain to paint This Work of choice, The which no humane spirit, nor hand, nor voice, Can once conceiue, less pourtray, least express, All over-whelm'd in gulfs so bottomless. Who (matching Art with Nature) likeneth Our grounds to Eden, fondly measureth By painted Butter-flies th'imperiall Eagle; And th'Elephant by every little Beagle. Or to wander vnprofitably in nice Questions, concerning the Garden of Eden and man's abode there.This fear to fail, shall serue me for a bridle, Lest (lacking wings and guide) too busie-idle, And over-bould, Gods Cabinet I clime, To seek the place, and search the very time When both our Parents, or but one was ta'en Out of our Earth, into that fruitfull Plain: How long they had that Garden in possession, Before their proud and insolent Transgression: What Children there they earned, and how many, Of whether sex: or, whether none or any: Or how (at least) they should haue propagated, If the sly malice of the serpent hated, Causing their fall, had not defil'd their kin, And vnborn seed, with leprosie of Sin. If void of Venus; sith vnlike it is, Such blessed state the noble flowr should miss Of Virgin-head; or, folk so perfect chaste Should furious feel, when they their loues imbraç't, Such tickling flames as our fond soule surprise (That dead a-while in Epilepsie lies) And slack our sinews all, by little and little Drowning our reason in foul pleasure brittle. Or whether else as men ingender now, Sith spouse-bed spot-less laws of God allow, If no excess command: sith else again The Lord had made the double sex in vain. Whether their Infants should haue had the powr We now perceiue in fresh youths lusty flowr, As nimble feet, limbs strong and vigorous, Industrious hands, and hearts courageous; Sith before Sin, Man ought not less appear In Natures gifts, then his then-seruants were: And lo the Partridge, which new-hatched bears On her weak back her parent-house, and wears (In stead of wings) a bever-supple Down, Follows her dam through furrows vp and down. Or else as now; sith in the womb of Eue A man of thirty yeers could never liue: Nor may we iudge 'gainst Natures course apparant, Without the sacred Scriptures speciall warrant: Which for our good (as Heav'ns dear babe) hath right To countermaund our reason and our sight. Whether their seed should with their birth haue brought Deep Knowledge, Reason, Vnderstanding-thought; Sith now we see the new-fall'n feeble Lamb Yet stain'd with bloud of his distressed Dam, Knowes well the Wolf, at whose fell sight he shakes, And, right the teat of th'vnknowne Ewe he takes: And sith a dull Dunce, which no knowledge can, Is a dead image, and no living man. Or the thick vail of ignorance's night Had hooded-vp their issues inward sight; Sith the much moisture of an Infant brain Receives so many shapes, that over-lain New dash the old; and the trim commixation Of confus'd fancies, full of alteration, Makes th'vnderstanding hull, which settle would, And findes no firm ground for his Anchors hould. Whether old Adam should haue left the place Vnto his Sons; they, to their after-race: Or whether all together at the last Should gloriously from thence to Heav'n haue past; The decision of such Questions is a busie idlenes.Search whoso list: who list let vaunt in pride T'haue hit the White, and let him (sage) decide The many other doubts that vainly rise. For mine own part I will not seem so wise: I will not waste my trauell and my seed To reap an empty straw, or fruit-less reed. Sin makes us perceiue more than sufficiently what happinesse our Grand-sire lost, and what misery he got, by his shamefull Fall.Alas! we knowe what Orion of grief Rain'd on the curst head of the creatures Chief, After that God against him war proclaim'd, And Satan princedom of the earth had claim'd. But none can knowe precisely, how at all Our Elders liv'd before their odious Fall: An vnknowne Cifer, and deep Pit it is, Where Dircean Oedipus his marks would miss: Sith Adam's self, if now he liv'd anew, Could scant vnwinde the knotty snarled clew Of double doubts and questions intricate That Schools dispute about this pristin state. But for sin, man had not beene subiect to death.But this sole point I rest resolved in, That, seeing Death's the meer effect of sin, Man had not dreaded Death's all-slaying might, Had he still stood in Innocence vpright. Simile.For, as two Bellows, blowing turn by turn, By litte and little make cold coals to burn, And then their fire inflames with glowing heat An iron bar; which, on the Anvill beat, Seems no more iron, but flies almost all In hissing sparks, and quick bright cinders small: So, the World's Soule should in our soule inspire Th'eternall force of an eternall fire, And then our soule (as form) breathe in our corse Her count-less numbers, and Heav'n-tuned force, Wherewith our bodies beauty beautifi'd, Should (like our death-less soule) haue never di'd. Obiections against the estate of man, who had not been subiect to death but for sin.Heer (wot I well) som wranglers will presume To say, Small fire will by degrees consume Our humor radicall: and, how-be-it The differing vertues of those fruits, as yet Had no agreement with the harmfull spight Of the fell Persian dangerous Aconite; And notwithstanding that then Adam's taste Could well haue vsed all, without all waste, Yet could they not restore him every day Vnto his body that which did decay; Because the food cannot (as being strange) So perfectly in humane substance change: For, it resembleth Wine, wherein too rife Simile. Water is brew'd, whereby the pleasant life Is over-cool'd; and so there rests, in fine, Nought of the strength, sauour, or taste of Wine. Besides, in time the naturall faculties Are tyr'd with toil; and th'Humour-enemies, Our death conspiring, vndermine, at last, Of our Soules prisons the foundations fast. I, but the Tree of life the strife did stay Answer to those obiections. Which th'Humours caused in this house of clay; And stopping th'evill, changed (perfect good) In body fed, the body of the food: Onely the Soules contagious malady Had force to frustrate this high remedy. Immortall then, and mortall, Man was made; Conclusion. Mortall he liv'd, and did immortall vade: For, 'fore th'effects of his rebellious ill, To dy or liue, was in his power and will: But since his Sin, and proud Apostasie, Ah! dy he may, but not (alas!) not-dy; As after his new-birth, he shall attain Onely a powr to never-dy again. FINIS. The Impostvre. THE II. PART OF THE FIRST DAY OF THE II. WEEK. The Argvment. Iustice and Mercy modul'd in their kinde: Satans proud Hate, and Enuy to Mankinde: His many Engins, and malitious Wiles, Whereby the best he many-times beguiles: Why he assum'd a Body, and began With Eue; by Her to vndermine her Man: Their dreadfull Fall: Their drouzy Conscience: Gods righteous Sentence. for their foul Offence, On them (and Theirs): Their Exile: Eden barr'd With flaming Sword, and Seraphin for guard. O who shall lend me light and nimble wings, That (passing Swallowes, and the swiftest things) Even in a moment, boldly-daring, I From Heav'n to Hell, from Hell to Heav'n may fly? O! who shall shew the countenance and gestures Of Mercy and Iustice? which fair sacred sisters, With equall poiz, doo ever balance ev'n Th'vnchanging Proiects of the King of Heav'n. Th'one stern of look, the other milde-aspecting: Th'one pleas'd with tears, the other bloud affecting. Th'one bears the Sword of vengeance vn-relenting: Th'other brings Pardon for the true-repenting. Th'one, from Earths-Eden, Adam did dismiss: Th'other hath rais'd him to a higher Bliss. Who shall direct my pen to paint the Story Of wretched mans forbidden-Bit-lost glory? What Spell shall charm th'attentiue Readers sense? What Fount shall fill my voice with eloquence? So that I, rapt, may ravish all this ILE With graue-sweet warbles of my sacred stile; Though Adams Doom, in every Sermon common, And founded on the error of a woman, Weary the vulgar, and be iudg'd a iest Of the profane zeal-scoffing Atheïst. Ah! Thou my God, even Thou (my soule refining He hath recourse to God, the only giuer of all sufficiency and dexterity in good and holy things. In holy Faiths pure Furnace, cleerly shining) Shalt make my hap far to surmount my hope, Instruct my spirit, and giue my tongue smooth scope: Thou (bountious) in my bould attempts shalt grace-me, And in the rank of holiest Poets place-me; And frankly grant, that (soaring neer the sky) Among our Authors, Eagle-like I fly: Or, at the least (if Heav'n such hap denay) I may point others, Honors beautious Way. While Adam bathes in these felicities, The enemy of God envieth man, and plotteth his destruction. Hell's Prince (sly parent of revolt and lies) Feels a pestiferous busie-swarming nest Of never-dying Dragons in his brest, Sucking his blood, tyring vpon his lungs, Pinching his entrails with ten thousand tongues, His cursed soule still most extreamly racking, Too frank in giving torments, and in taking: But aboue all, Hate, Pride, and Envious spight, His hellish life doo torture day and night. For, th'Hate he bears to God, who hath him driv'n Iustly for ever from the glittering Heav'n, To dwell in darknes of a sulph'ry clowd (Though still his brethrens service be allow'd): The Proud desire to haue in his subiection Mankinde inchain'd in gyues of Sins infection: And th'Enuious heart-break to see yet to shine In Adams face Gods Image all divine, Which he had lost; and that Man might atchiue The glorious bliss his Pride did him depriue; Growen barbarous Tyrants of his treacherous will, Spur-on his course, his rage redoubling still. Or rather (as the prudent Hebrue notes) 'Tis that old Python which through hundred throats Doth proudly hiss, and (past his wont) doth fire A hell of Furies in his fell desire: His envious heart, self-swoln with sullen spight, Brooks neither greater, like, nor lesser wight: Dreads th'one, as Lord; as equall; hates another; And (iealous) doubts the rising of the other. To vent his poyson, this notorious Tempter His subtilty in executing his Designes. (Meer spirit) assails not Eue, but doth attempt her In fained form: for else, the soule diuine, Which rul'd (as Queen) the Little-worlds designe, So purely kept her Vow of Chastity, That he in vain should tempt her Constancy. Therefore he fleshly doth the Flesh assay (Suborning that) her Mistress to betray; A suttle Pandar with more ticing sleights Then Sea hath Fish, or Heav'n hath twinkling lights. Why he hid him in a body.For, had he been of an ethereall matter, Of fiery substance, or aiereall nature; The needfull help of language had he wanted, Whereby Faiths ground-work was to be supplanted: Sith such pure bodies haue nor teeth, nor tongues, Lips, artires, nose, palate, nor panting lungs, Which rightly plac't are properly created True instruments of sounds articulated. Why he appeared not in his own likenes: nor transformed him into an Angell of light.And furthermore, though from his birth h' had had Heart-charming cunning smoothly to perswade, He fear'd (malitious) if he, care-less, came Vn-masked (like himself, in his owne name) In deep distrust man entring, suddenly, Would stop his ears, and his foul presence fly: As (opposite) taking the shining face Of sacred Angels full of glorious grace, He then suspected, lest th'Omnipotent Should think man's Fal scarce worthy punishment. Simile.Much like (therefore) som theef that doth conceiue From trauellers both life and goods to reaue, And in the twi-light (while the Moon doth play In Thetis Palace) neer the Kings high-way Himself doth ambush in a bushy Thorn; Then in a Caue, then in a field of Corn, Creeps to and fro, and fisketh in and out, And yet the safety of each place doth doubt; Till, resolute at last (vpon his knee Taking his levell) from a hollow Tree, He swiftly sends his fire-wingd messenger, At his false sute t'arrest the passenger: Our freedoms felon, fountain of our sorrow, He hides him vnder diuers figures.Thinks now the beauty of a Horse to borrow; Anon to creep into a Haifers side; Then in a Cock, or in a Dog to hide; Then in a nimble Hart himself to shroud; Then in the starr'd plumes of a Peacock proud; And lest he miss a mischief to effect, Oft changeth minde, and varies oft aspect. Why he chose the Serpent.At last, remembring that of all the broods In Mountains, Plains, Airs, Waters, Wildes and Woods, The knotty Serpents spotty generation Are filled with infectious inflammation: And though they want Dogs teeth, Boars tusks, Bears paws, The Vultures bill, Buls horns, and Griphins claws; Yea, seem so weak, as if they had not might To hurt vs once, much less to kill vs quite: Yet, many times they treacherously betray vs, And with their breath, look, tongue or train they slay vs; He crafty cloaks him in a Dragons skin All bright-bespect; that, speaking so within That hollow Sagbuts supple-wreathing plies, The mover might with th'Organ sympathize. For, yet the faith-less Serpent (as they say) With horror crawl'd not groueling on the clay, Nor to Mankinde (as yet) was held for hatefull, Sith that's the hire of his offence ingratefull. But now, to censure how this change befell Sundry opinions hereupon. Our wits com short, our words suffize not well To vtter it: much less our feeble Art Can imitate this sly malitious part. Somtimes me seems (troubling Eues spirit) the Fiend Made her this speaking fancy apprehend. For, as in liquid clouds (exhaled thickly) Water and Air (as moist) doo mingle quickly; The euill Angels slide too easily, As subtile Spirits, into our fantasie. Somtimes me seems She saw (wo-worth the hap) No very Serpent, but a Serpents shape: Whether that, Satan plaid the Iuggler there, Who tender eys with charmed Tapers blear, Transforming so, by subtile vapoury gleams, Mens heads to Monsters, into Eels the beams: Or whether, Divels having bodies light, Quick, nimble, actiue, apt to change with sleight, In shapes or shewes, they guilefull haue propos'd; In brief, like th'Air whereof they are compos'd. For, as the Air, with scattred clouds bespred, Is heer and there black, yellow, white and red, Resembling Armies, Monsters, Mountains, Dragons, Rocks, fiery Castles, Forrests, Ships and Wagons, And such to vs through glass transparent clear From form to form varying it doth appear: So, these seducers can growe great, or small, Or round, or square, or straight, or short, or tall, As fits the passions they are moved by, And such our soule receives them from our ey. Somtimes; that Satan (onely for this work) Fain'd him a Serpents shape, wherein to lurk. For, Nature framing our soules enemies, Of bodies light, and in experience wise, In malice crafty, curious they assemble Small-Elements, which (as of kin) resemble, Whereof a Mass is made, and thereunto They soon giue growth and lively motion too. Not, that they be Creators: for, th'Almighty, Who first of nothing made vaste Amphitrite, The Worlds dull Centre, Heav'ns ay-turning Frame, And whirling Air, sole merits that high Name: Who (onely Beeing) Being giues to all, And of all things the seeds substantiall Within their first-born bodies hath inclos'd, To be in time by Natures hand dispos'd: Not those, who (taught by curious Art or Nature) Haue giv'n to things Heav'n-pointed form and stature, Hastned their growth, or wakened learnedly The forms that formless in the Lump did ly. But (to conclude) I think 'twas no conceipt, No fained Idoll, nor no iuggling sleight, Nor body borrowed for this vses sake, But the self Serpent which the Lord did make In the beginning: for, his hatefull breed Bears yet the pain of this pernicious deed. Yet't tis a doubt whether the Divell did Gouern the Dragon (not there selfly hid) To raise his courage, and his tongue direct, Locally absent, present by effect: As when the sweet strings of a Lute we strike, Another Lute laid neer it, sounds the like; Nay, the same note, through secret sympathy (Vntoucht) receiving Life and Harmony: Or, as a star, which (though far distant) pours, Vpon our heads, hap-less or happy showrs. Or, whether for a time he did abide Wit in the doubling Serpents damask hide, Holding a place-less place: as our soule dear, Through the dim lanthorn of our flesh, shines clear; And bound-less bounds it self in so straight space, As form in body, not as body in place. But this stands sure, how-ever else it went, Th'old Serpent serv'd as Satans instrument Conclusion of the former opinions. A comparison.To charm in Eden, with a strong illusion, Our silly Grandam to her selfs confusion. For, as an old, rude, rotten, tune-less Kit, If famous Dowland daign to finger it, Makes sweeter Musick then the choicest Lute In the gross handling of a clownish Brute: So, whiles a learned Fiend with skilfull hand Doth the dull motions of his mouth command, This self-dumb Creature's glozing Rhetorike With bashfull shame great Orators would strike. So, Faiery Trunks within Epyrus Groue, Mov'd by the spirit that was inspir'd by loue, With fluent voyce (to every one that seeks) Fore-tell the Fates of light-beleeuing Greeks: So, all incenst, the pale Engastromith (Rul'd by the furious spirit he's haunted with) Speaks in his womb; So, well a workmans skill Supplies the want of any organ ill: So doth the Phantike (lifting vp his thought On Satans wing) with a tongue distraught Strange Oracles, and his sick spirit doth plead Euen of those Arts that he did never reade. O ruth-less murderer of immortall Soules! The sundry sutle and horrible endeavours of the Divell, putting on divers forms to overthrow man-kinde. Alas to pull vs from the happy Poles, And plunge vs headlong in thy yawning hell, Thy ceas-less frauds and fetches who can tell? Thou play'st the Lion, when thou dost engage Bloud-thirsty Nero's barbarous heart with rage, While flesh in murders (butcher-like) he paints The Saint-poor world with the dear bloud of Saints. Thou play'st the Dog, when by the mouth profane Or som false Prophet thou doost belch thy bane, While from the Pulpit barkingly he rings Bold blasphemies against the King of kings. Thou play'st the Swine, when plung'd in pleasures vile, Som Epicure doth sober mindes defile; Transforming lewdly, by his loose impiety, Strict Lacedæmon to a soft society. Thou play'st the Nightingale, or else the Swan, When any famous Rhetorician, With captious wit and curious language, draws Seduced hearers; and subverts the laws. Thou play'st the Fox, when thou dost fain a-right The face and phrase of som deep Hypocrite, True painted Toomb, dead-seeming coals but quick; A Scorpion fell, whose hidden tail doth prick. Yet, this were little, if thy spight audacious Spar'd (at the least) the face of Angels gracious, And if thou didst not (Ape-like) imitate Th'Almighties Works, the wariest Wits to mate. But (without numbring all thy suttle baits, The Poet resumeth his Discourse touching the temptation of Eue. And nimble iuggling with a thousand sleights) Timely returning where I first digrest, I'le onely heer thy first Deceipt digest. The Dragon then, Mans Fortress to surprise, Follows som Captains martiall policies, Comparison.Who, yer too neer an adverse place he pitch, The situation marks, and sounds the ditch, With his eys leuell the steep wall he metes, Surveies the flanks, his Camp in order sets; And then approaching, batters sore the side Which Art and Nature haue least fortifi'd: So, this old Souldier, hauing marked rife The first-born payrs yet danger-dreadless life; Mounting his Canons, suttly he assaults The part he findes in evident defaults: Namely, poor Woman, wauering, weak, vnwise, Light, credulous, news-louer, giv'n to lies. Sathans Orati?. Eue, Second honour of this Vniverse! Is 't true (I pray) that iealous God, perverse, Forbids (quoth he) both you and all your race All the fair Fruits these siluer Brooks embrace; So oft bequeath'd you, and by you possest, And day and night by your own labour drest? With th'air of these sweet words, the wily Snake A poysoned air inspired (as it spake) Eues answer.In Eues frail brest; who thus replies: O! knowe, What e'r thou be (but, thy kinde care doth showe A gentle friend) that all the fruits and flowrs In this earths-heav'n are in our hands and powrs, Except alone that goodly fruit diuine, Which in the midst of this green ground doth shine; But, all-good God (alas! I wot not why) Forbad vs touch that Tree, on pain to dy. She ceast; already brooding in her heart A curious wish, that will her weal subvert. A fit c?parison.As a false Louer, that thick snares hath laid T'intrap the honour of a fair young Maid, When she (though little) listning ear affords. To his sweet, courting, deep-affected words, Feels som asswaging of his freezing flame, And sooths himself with hope to gain his game; And rapt with ioy, vpon this point persists, That parleing City never long resists: Even so the Serpent, that doth counterfet A guilefull Call t'allure vs to his net; Perceiuing Eue his flattering gloze digest, He prosecutes, and jocund, doth not rest, Till he haue try'd foot, hand, and head, and all, Vpon the Breach of this new-battered wall. The Diuels reply.No, fair (quoth he) beleeue not, that the care God hath, mankinde from spoyling death to spare, Makes him forbid you (on so strict condition) This purest, fairest, rarest Fruits fruition: A double fear, an envie, and a hate, His iealous heart for ever cruciate; Sith the suspected vertue of This Tree Shall soon disperse the cloud of Idiocy, Which dims your eyes; and further, make you seem (Excelling vs) even equall Gods to him. O Worlds rare glory! reach thy happy hand, Reach, reach, I say: why dost thou stop or stand? Begin thy Bliss, and do no fear the threat Of an vncertain God-head, onely great His audacious impudency. Through self-aw'd zeal: put on the glistring Pall Of immortality: do not fore-stall (As envious stepdame) thy posteritie The soverain honour of Diuinitie. This parley ended, our ambitious Grandam, Who only yet did heart and ey abandon The Apostasy of Eue. Against the Lord; now farther doth proceed, And hand and mouth makes guiltie of the deed. A novice Theef (that in a Closet spies A heap of Gold, that on the Table lies) A Comparison. Pale, fearfull shivering, twice or thrice extends, And twice or thrice retires his fingers ends, And yet again returns; the booty takes, And fain ly-bold, vp in his cloak it makes, Scarce findes the doore, with faultring foot he flies, And still lookes back for fear of Hu-on cries: Even so doth Eue shew by like fear-full fashions The doubtfull combat of contending Passions; She would, she should not not; glad, sad; coms, and goes: And long she marts about a Match of Woes: But (out alas!) at last she toucheth it, And (hauing toucht) tastes the forbidden bit. Then as a man that from a lofty Clift, Another comparison liuely expressing the Fall of Man, by the prouocation of his wife. Or steepy Mountain doth descend too swift, Stumbling at somwhat, quickly clips som lim Of som deer kinsman walking next to him, And by his headlong fall, so brings his friend To an vntimely, sad, and sudden end; Our Mother, falling, hales her Spouse anon Down to the gulf of pitchy Acheron. For, to the wisht Fruits beautifull aspect, Sweet Nectar-taste, and wonderfull effect, Cunningly adding her quaint smiling glances, Her witty speech, and pretty countenances, She so prevails; that her blind Lord, at last, A morsell of the sharp-sweet fruit doth taste. Now suddenly wide-open feel they might (Siel'd for their good) both soules and bodies sight; The effects of their disobedience.But the sad Soule hath lost the Character, And sacred Image that did honour her: The wretched Body, full of shame and sorrow To see it naked, is in forc't to borrow The Trees broad leaues, whereof they aprons frame, From Heav'ns faire ey to hide their filthy shame. Alas, fond death-lings! O! behold how cleer The knowledge is that you haue bought so deer: In heav'nly things yee are more blinde then Moals, In earthly Owls. O! think ye (silly soules) The sight that swiftely through th'Earth's solid centers (As globes of pure transparent crystall) enters Cannot transpearce your leaues? or do ye ween, Covering your shame so to conceal your sin? Or that, a part thus clowded, all doth lie Safe from the search of Heav'ns all-seeing ey? Thus yet, mans troubled dull Intelligence Had of his fault but a confused sense: As in a dream, after much drink it chances, Disturbed spirits are vext with raving fancies. The extraordinary presence of God, awakes their drowsie soules swallowd vp of Sin: and begins to arraign them.Therefore, the Lord, within the Garden fair, Moving betimes I wot not I what ayre, But supernaturall; whose breath divine Brings of his presence a most certain signe: Awakes their Lethargie, and to the quick, Their self-doom'd soules doth sharply press and prick: Now more and more making their pride to fear The frowning visage of their Iudge severe: To seek new-refuge in more secret harbors Among the dark shade of those tufting arbors. Adam, quoth God, (with thundring maiesty) Where art thou (wretch!) what doost thou? answer me Thy God and Father; from whose hand, thy health Thou hold'st, thine honour, and all sorts of wealth. Description of the horrible effects of a guilty Conscience summoned to the presence of God.At this sad summons, wofull man resembles A bearded rush that in a riuer trembles: His rosie cheeks are chang'd to earthen hew; His dying body drops in ycie deaw; His tear-drown'd eyes, a night of clouds bedims; About his ears, a buzzing horror swims; His fainted knees, with feebleness are humble; His faultring feet do slide away and stumble: He hath not (now) his free, bold, stately port; But down-cast looks, in fearfull slavish sort; Now, nought of Adam, doth in Adam rest; He feeles his senses pain'd, his soule opprest: A confus'd hoast of violent passions iar; His flesh and spirit are in continuall war: And now no more (through conscience of his error) He hears or sees th'Almighty, but with terror: And loth he answers (as with tongue distraught) Confessing (thus) his fear, but not his fault. O Lord! thy voyce, thy dreadfull voyce hath made Adams answer. Me fearfull hide me in this covert shade. For, naked as I am (O most of might!) I dare not come before thine awfull sight. Naked (quoth God)? why (faith-less renegate, God vrgeth the cause of his deiection &amp; feare. Apostate Pagan!) who hath told thee that? Whence springs thy shame? what makes thee thus to run From shade to shade, my presence still to shun? Hast thou not tasted of the learned Tree, Whereof (on pain of death) I warned thee? O righteous God (quoth Adam) I am free Adams reply, excusing himself &amp; couertly insputing his Guile to God. From this offence: the wife thou gavest me, For my companion and my comforter, She made me eat that deadly meat with her. And thou (quoth God) O! thou frail treacherous Bride, Examination of Eue, who excuseth her selfe likewise on another. Why, with thy self, hast thou seduc't thy Guide? Lord (answers Eue) the Serpent did intice My simple frailty to this sinfull vice. Mark heer, how He, who fears not who reform An example for Iudges &amp; Magistrates. His high Decrees, not subiect vnto form, Or stile of Court: who, all-wise, hath no need T'examine proof or witness of the deed: Who for sustayning of vnequall Scale, Dreads not the Doom of a Mercuriall; Yer Sentence pass, doth publikely convent, Confront, and heer with eare indifferent Th'Offenders sad: then with iust indignation, Pronounceth thus their dreadfull Condemnation. Ah cursed Serpent, which my fingers made The Sentence of the supreame Iudge against the guilty Prisoners: and first of all against the Serpent. To serue mankinde: th'hast made thy selfe a blade Wherewith vain Man and his inveigled wife (Self-parricides) haue reft their proper life. For this thy fault (true Fountain of all ill) Thou shalt be hatefull 'mong all creatures still. Groueling in dust, of dust thou ay shalt feed: I'le kindle war between the Womans seed, And thy fell race; hers on the head shall ding Thine: thine again hers in the heel shall sting. Rebell to me, vnto thy kindred curst, Against the Woman. False to thy husband, to thy self the worst: Hope not, thy fruit so easily to bring-forth As now thou slay'st it: hence-forth, every Birth Shall torture thee with thousand sorts of pain; Each artire, sinew, muscle, ioynt and vain, Shall feel his part: besides foul vomitings, Prodigious longings, thought-full languishings, With change of colours, swouns, and many others, Eternall fellows of all future mothers: Vnder his yoak, thy husband thee shall haue, Tyrant, by thee made the Arch-tyrants slaue. Against man.And thou disloyall, which hast harkned more To a wanton fondling then my sacred lore, Henceforth the sweat shall bubble on thy brow: Thy hands shall blister, and thy back shall bow: Ne'r shalt thou send into thy branchie vains A bit, but bought with price of thousand pains. For, the earth feeling (even in her) th'effect Of the doom thundred 'gainst thy foul defect; In stead of sweet fruits which she selfly yeelds Seed-less, and Art-less over all thy fields, With thorns and burs shall bristle vp her brest: (In short) thou shalt not taste the sweets of rest, Till ruth-less Death by his extreamest pain Thy dust-born bodie turn to dust again. Obiections to excuse the Sin of Man.Heer I conceiue, that flesh and blood will brangle, And murmuring Reason with th'Almighty wrangle, 1.Who did our parents with Free-will indue, Though he fore-saw, that that would be the clew Should lead their steps into the wofull way Where life is death ten thousand times a day: Now all that he fore-sees, befals: and further, He all events by his free powr doth order. 2.Man taxeth God of too-vniust severity, For plaguing Adams sin in his posterity: So that th'old yeers renewed generations Cannot asswage his venging indignations, Which haue no other ground to prosecute, But the mis-eating of a certain fruit. Answers to the first obiection.O dusty wormling! dar'st thou striue and stand With Heav'ns high Monarch? wilt thou (wretch) demand 1.Count of his deeds? Ah! shall the Potter make His clay, such fashion, as him list, to take? And shall not God (Worlds Founder, Natures Father) Dispose of man (his own meer creature) rather? The supream King, who (Iudge of greatest Kings) By number, weight and measure, acts all things, Vice-loathing Lord, pure Iustice, Patron strong, Law's life, Right's rule, will he do any wrong? 2.Man, holdest thou of God thy frank Free-will, But free t'obay his sacred goodness still? Freely to follow him, and do his hest, Not Philtre-charm'd, nor by Busiris prest? God arms thee with discourse: but thou (O wretch!) By the keen edge the wound-soule sword doost catch; Killing thy selfe, and in thy loins thy line. O banefull Spider (weaving wofull twine) All Heav'ns pure flowrs thou turnest into poyson: Thy sense reaues sense: thy reason robs thy reason. For, thou complainest of Gods grace, whose Still Extracts from dross of thine audacious ill, Three vnexpected goods; praise for his Name; 3. Bliss for thy self; for Satan endless-shame: Sith, but for sin, Iustice and Mercy were But idle names: and but that thou didst erre, Christ had not com to conquer and to quell, Vpon the Cross, Sin, Satan, Death, and Hell; Making thee blessed more since thine offence, Then in thy primer happy innocence. Then, might'st thou dy; now death thou doost not doubt: Now, in the Heav'n; then, didst thou ride without: In Earth, thou liv'dst then; now in Heav'n thou beest: Then, thou didst hear Gods word; it, now thou seest: Then, pleasant fruits; now, Christ is thy repast: Then might'st thou fall; but now thou standest fast. Now, Adams fault was not in deed so light, As seemes to Reason's sin-bleard Owlie sight: But 't was a chain where all the greatest sinns Were one in other linked fast, as Twins: Ingratitude, pride, treason, gluttony, Too-curious skill-thirst, enuy, felony, Too-light, too-late beleef; were the sweet baits That made him wander from Heav'ns holy straights. What wouldst thou (Father) say vnto a Son Of perfect age, to whom for portion (Witting and willing, while thy self yet livest) All thy possessions in the earth thou givest: And yet th'vngratefull, grace-less, insolent, In thine own Land, rebellion doth invent? Map now an Adam in thy memory; By Gods own hand made with great maiesty, Not poor, nor pined; but at whose command The rich aboundance of the world doth stand: Not slaue to sense, but hauing freely might To bridle it, and range it still aright: No idiot fool, nor drunk with vaine opinion; But Gods Disciple and his deerest Minion: Who rashly growes for little, nay for nought, His deadly foe that all his good had wrought: So mayst thou ghess, what whip, what rope, what rack, What fire, were fit to punish Adams lack. Answers to the second obiection.Then, sith Mans sin by little and little runs 1.End-less, through every Age from Sires to Sons; And still the farther this foul sin-spring flowes It still more muddy and more filthy growes: Thou ought'st not marvail, if (even yet) his seed Feel the iust wages of this wicked deed. For, though the keen sting of concupiscence Cannot, yer birth, his fell effect commence; The vnborn Babe, hid in the Mothers womb, Is sorrow's servant, and Sin's servile groom, As a frail Mote from the first Mass extract, Which Adam baen'd by his rebellious fact. Sound off-spring coms not of a Kinde infected: Parts are not fair, if totall be defected: And a defiled stinking sink doth yeeld More durt then water to the neighbour field. 2.While nights black muffler hoodeth vp the skies, Simile.The silly blind-man misseth not his eyes: But when the day summons to work again, His night, eternall then he doth complain, That he goes groping, and his hand (alas!) Is fain to guide his foot, and guard his face: So man, that liveth in the wombs obscurity, Knowes not, nor maketh known his lusts impurity: Which, for 't is sown in a too-plentious ground, Takes root already in the Caues profound Of his infected Hart: with's birth, it peers, And growes in strength, as he doth growe in years; And waxt a Tree (though proin'd with thousand cares) An execrable deadly fruit it bears. 3.Thou seest, no wheat Helleborus can bring: Simile.Nor barly, from the madding Morrell spring: The bleating Lambs braue Lions doe not breed: The leprous Parents, raise a leprous seed: Even so our Grand-sire, living Innocent, Had stockt the whole world with a Saint-descent: But suffering sin in Eden him invade, His sons, the sons of Sin and Wrath he made. 4.For, God did seem t'indow, with glory and grace, Not the first Man so much, as all mans race; And after reaue again those gifts divine, Not him so much, as in him all his line. Simile.For, if an odious Traitour that conspires, Against a Prince, or to his state aspires, Feel not alone the laws extremity; But his sons sons (although somtimes they be Honest and vertuous) for their Fathers blame, Are hap-less scarr'd with an eternall shame: May not th'Eternall with a righteous terror, In Adams issue punish Adams error? May he not thrall them vnder Deaths command, And fear their brows with everlasting brand Of infamy, who in his stock (accurst) Haue graft worse slips then Adam set at first? Mans seed then iustly, by succession, Conclusion of the former disputations, and execution of God's Decree against Adam &amp; Eue; they are driven out of Eden. Bears the hard penance of his high transgression: And Adam heer, from Eden banished, As first offender is first punished. Hence (quoth the Lord) hence, hence (accursed race) Out of my Garden: quick, auoyd the place, This beautious place, pride of this Vniverse, A house vnworthy Masters so perverse. Those that (in quarrell of the Strong of Strongs, Simile. And iust reuenge of Queen, and Countries wrongs) Were witnesses to all the wofull plaints, The sighes, and tears, and pitifull complaints, Of brauing Spaniards (chiefly braue in word) When by the valiant Heav'n-assisted sword Of Mars-like Essex, Englands Marshall-Earl (Then Albions Patron, and Eliza's Pearl) They were expulst from Cadiz, their deerest pleasure, Losing their Town, their honour, and their treasure: Wo worth (said they) wo worth our Kings ambition; Wo worth our Cleargie, and their Inquisition: He seeks new Kingdoms, and doth lose his old; They burne for conscience, but their thirst is gold: Wo, and alas, wo to the vain brauados Of Typhon-like inuincible Armados, Which like the vaunting Monster-man of Gath, Haue stirr'd against vs little Dauids wrath: Wo-worth our sins: wo-worth our selues, and all Accursed causes of our sudden fall. Those well may ghess the bitter agonies, And luke-warm Rivers gushing down the eyes Of our first Parents, out of Eden driv'n (Of Repeal hope-less) by the hand of Heav'n; For, the Almightie set before the dore Of th'holy Park, a Seraphin that bore A wauing sword, whose body shined bright, The earthly Eden shut-vp foreuer from Mankinde. Like flaming Comet in the midst of night; A body meerly Metaphysicall, Which (differing little from th'One vnicall, Th'Act-simply-pure, the only-beeing Beeing) Approcheth matter; ne'rtheless, not being Of matter mixt: or rather is so made So meerly spirit, that not the murdering blade, His ioyned quantity can part in two: For (pure) it cannot Suffer ought, but Doo. FINIS. The Fvries. THE THIRD PART OF THE FIRST DAY OF THE II. WEEK. The Argvment. The World's transform'd from what it was at first: For Adams sin all creatures else accurst: Their Harmony distuned by His iar: Yet all again concent, to make him war; As, th'Elements, and aboue all, the Earth: Three ghastly Fvries; Sickness, War, and Dearth, A generall Muster of the Bodies Griefs: The Soules Diseases, vnder sundry Chiefs: Both, full of Horror, but the later most; Where vgly Vice in Vertues Mask doth boast. This's not the World. O! whither am I brought? Sin hath changed and disfigured the face of the World. This Earth I tread, this hollow-hanging Vault, Which Dayes reducing, and renewing Nights, Renews the grief of mine afflicted sprights; This Sea I sail, this troubled Ayr I sip, Are not The First-weeks glorious Workmanship: This wretched Round is not the goodly Globe Th'Eternall trimmed in so various Robe: 'Tis but a Dungeon and a dreadfull Caue, Of that first World the miserable Graue. All-quickning Spirit, great God, that (iustly-strange, Inuocation. Iudge-turned-Father) wrought'st this wondrous change, Change and new-mould me; Lord, thy hand assist, That in my Muse appear no earthly mist: Make me thine organ, giue my voyce dexterity Sadly to sing this sad Change to Posterity. And, bountious Giuer of each perfect gift, So tune my voyce to his sweet-sacred Clift, That in each strain my rude vnready tong Be liuely Eccho of his learned Song. And, hence-forth, let our holy Musick rauish All well-born Soules, from fancies lewdly-lauish (Of charming Sin the deep-inchaunting Syrens, The snares of vertue, valour-softning Hyrens) That toucht with terror of thine indignation, Presented in this wofull Alteration, We all may seek; by prayer and true repentance, To shun the rigour of thy wrathfull Sentence. The Translator heer bumbly vaileth bonnet to the Kings Maiesty; who many yeeres since (for his Princely exercise) translated these FVRIES, the VRANIA, and som other peeces of Du BARTAS.But, yer we farther pass, our slender Bark Must heer strike top-sails to a Princely Ark Which keeps these Straights: He hails vs threatfully, Star-boord our helm; Com vnderneath his Lee. Ho, Whence your Bark? Of Zeal-land: Whither bound? For Vertues Cape: What lading? Hope. This Sound You should not pass; saue that your voyage tends To benefit our Neighbours and our Frends. Thanks, Kingly Captain; daign vs then (we pray) Som skilfull Pylot through this Fvriovs Bay; Or, in this Chanell, sith we are to learn, Vouchsafe to togh vs at your Royall Stern. Yer That our Sire (O too too proudly-base) Turn'd tail to God, and to the Fiend his face, Happy estate of the World, before Sin: set forth by a Similitude.This mighty World did seem an Instrument True-strung, well-tun'd, and handled excellent, Whose symphony resounded sweetly-shrill Th'Almighties praise, who play'd vpon it still. While man serv'd God, the World serv'd him; the lyue And liue-less creatures seemed all to striue To nurse this league; and, loving zealously These two deer Heads, embraced mutually: In sweet accord, the base with high reioyc't, The hot with cold, the solid with the moist; And innocent Astræa did combine All with the mastick of a loue divine. The Sympathy yet appearing between certain Creatures, is but as a little shadow of the perfect vnion which was among all Creatures, before Mans Fall.For, th'hidden loue that now-adaies doth holde The Steel and Load-stone, Hydrargire and Golde, Th'Amber and straw; that lodgeth in one shell Pearl-fish and Sharpling: and vnites so well Sargons and Goats, the Sperage and the Rush, Th'Elm and the Vine, th'Oliue and Myrtle-bush, Is but a spark or shadow of that Loue Which at the first in every thing did moue, When as th'Earth's Muses with harmonious sound To Heav'ns sweet Musick humbly did resound. But Adam, being chief of all the strings Of this large Lute, o're-retched, quickly brings All out of tune: and now for melody. Of warbling Charms, it yels so hideously, That it affrights fell Enyon, who turmoils To raise again th'old Chaos antick broils: Heav'n, that still smiling on his Paramour, Of the Discord that Sin hath brought among all things. Still in her lap did Mel and Manna pour, Now with his hail, his rain, his frost and heat, Doth parch, and pinch, and over-whelm, and bear, And hoares her head with Snowes, and (iealous) dashes Against her brows his fiery lightning slashes: On th'other side, the sullen, envious Earth Sundry notable Antipathies. From blackest Cels of her foul brest sends forth A thousand foggy fumes, which every-where With cloudy mists Heav'ns crystall front besmear. Since that, the Woolf the trembling Sheep pursues; The crowing Cock, the Lion stout eschews: The Pullein hide them from the Puttock's flight, The Mastiffe's mute at the Hyænas sight: Yea (who would think it?) these fell enmities Rage in the sense-less trunks of Plants and Trees: The Vine, the Cole; the Cole-wort Swines-bread dreads, The Fearn abhors the hollow waving Reeds: The Oliue and the Oak participate, Even to their earth, signes of their ancient hate, Which suffers not (O date-less discord!) th'one Liue in that ground where th'other first hath growen. O strange instinct! O deep immortall rage, Whose fiery fewd no Læthe sloud can swage! So, at the sound of Wolf-Drums rattling thunder Th'affrighted Sheep-skin-Drum doth rent in sunder: So, that fell Monsters twisted entrails cuts (By secret powr) the poor Lambs twined guts, Which (after death) in steed of bleating mute, Are taught to speak vpon an Yvory Lute: And so the Princely Eagles ravening plumes The feathers of all other Fowls consumes. The First-mov'd Heav'n (in 't self it self still stirring) Rapts with his course (quicker then windes swift whirring) All th'other Sphears, and to Alcides Spyres From Alexanders Altars driues their Fires: But mortall Adam, Monarch heer beneath, Erring draws all into the paths of death; And on rough Seas, as a blinde Pilot rash, Against the rock of Heav'ns iust wrath doth dash The Worlds great Vessell, sayling yerst at ease, With gentle gales, good guide, on quiet Seas. The estate of Man before Sin.For (yer his Fall) which way so e'r he rowl'd His wondering eyes God every-where behold; In Heav'n, in Earth, in Ocean, and in Ayr, He sees, and feels, and findes him every-where. The World was like a large and sumptuous Shop Where God his goodly treasures did vnwrap: Or Crystall glass most linely representing. His sacred Goodness, every-where frequenting. His estate after Sinne.But, since his sin, the wofull wretch findes none Herb, garden, groue, field, fountain, stream or stone, Beast, mountain, valley, sea-gate, shoar or haven, But bears his Deaths-doom openly ingraven: In brief, the whole scope this round Centre hath, Is a true store-house of Heav'ns righteous wrath. Al creatures fr? the highest to the lowest, enemies to Man.Rebellious Adam, from his God revolting, Findes his yerst-subiects 'gainst himselfe insulting: The tumbling Sea, the Ayr with tempests driven, Thorn-bristled Earth, the sad and lowring Heav'n (As from the oath of their allegeance free) Revenge on him th'Almighties iniury. The Heauens, with all therein.The Stars coniur'd through envious Influence, By secret Hang-men punish his offence: The Sun with heat, the Moon with cold doth vex-him, Th'Ayr with vnlookt-for sudden changes checks-him, With fogs and frosts, hails, snowes, and sulph'ry thunders, Blasting, and storms, and more prodigious wonders. Al the Elem?ts.Fire, fall'n from Heav'n, or else by Art incited, Fire.Or by mischance in som rich building lighted, Aire.Or from som Mountains burning bowels throw'n, Repleat with Sulphur, Pitch, and Pumy stone, With sparkling fury spreads, and in few hours The labour of a thousand years devours. Sea.The greedy Ocean, breaking wonted bounds, Vsurps his Heards, his wealthy Iles and Towns. Earth.The grieved Earth, to ease her (as it seems) Of such profane accursed weight, somtimes Swallowes whole Countries, and the airie tops Of Prince-proud towrs, in her black womb she wraps. Earth brings forth weeds.And in despight of him, abhord and hatefull She many waies proues barren and ingratefull: Mocking our hopes, turning our seed-Wheat-kernel To burn-grain Thistle, and to vapourie Darnel, Cockle, wilde Oats, rough Burs, Corn-cumbring Tares, Short Recompence for all our costly cares. Venomous plants.Yet this were little, if she more malicious, Fell stepdame, brought vs not Plants more pernicious: As sable Henbane; Morell, making mad: Cold poysoning Poppy, itching, drowsie, sad: The stifning Carpese, th'eyes-foe Hemlock stinking, Limb-numming belching: and the sinew-shrinking Dead-laughing Apium, weeping Aconite (Which in our Vulgar deadly Wolfs-bane hight) The dropsie-breeding, sorrow-bringing Psylly (Heer called Flea-Wurt) Colchis banefull Lilly, (With vs Wilde-Saffron) blistring byting fell: Hot Napell, making lips and tongue to swell: Blood-boyling Yew, and costiue Misseltoe: With yce-cold Mandrake, and a many mo Such fatall plants; whose fruit, seed, sap, or root, T'vntimely Grace doe bring our heed-less foot. Besides, she knowes, we brutish value more, Poyson hidden among the Metals. Then Liues or Honours, her rich glittering Ore: That Auarice our bound-less thought still vexes: Therefore among her wreakfull baits she mixes Quick siluer Lithargie and Orpiment, Where with our entrails are oft gnawn and rent: So that somtimes; for Body, and for Minde, Torture and torment, in one Mine we finde. What resteth more? The Masters skilfull most, The excellency of Mans Dominion ouer the Creatures before his Fall. With gentle gales driv'n to the wished Coast, Not with less labour guide their winged wayns On th'azure fore-head of the liquid plains: Nor crafty Iugglers, can more easily make Their selfe-liv'd Puppets (for their lucres fake) To skip, and scud, and play, and prate, and praunce, And fight, and fall, and trip, and turn, and daunce: Then happy we did rule the scaly Legions That dumbly dwell in stormy water-Regions; Then feathered singers, and the stubborn droues That haunt the Desarts and the shady Groues: At every word they trembled then for aw, And every wink then serv'd them as a law; And always bent all duty to obserue-vs, Without command, stood ready still to serue-vs. But now (alas!) through our fond Parents fall, The Creatures now becom Tyrants and Traitors to Him, whose slaues and seruants they were before Sin. They (of our slaues) are growen our tyrants all. Wend we by Sea? the drad Leuiathan Turns vpside-down the boyling Ocean, And on the suddain sadly doth intoomb Our floting Castle in deep Thetis womb; Yerst in the welkin like an Eagle towring, And on the water like a Dolphin scowring. Walk we by Land? how many loathsom swarms Of speckled poysons, with pestiferous arms, In every corner in close Ambush lurk With secret bands our sodain banes to work? Besides, the Lion and the Leopard, Boar, Beare, and Wolf to death pursue vs hard; And, ielous vengers of the wrongs divine, In peeces pull their Soverains sinfull line. The huge thick Forrests haue nor bush nor brake But hides som Hang-man our loath'd life to take: In every hedge and ditch both day and night We fear our death, of every leafe affright. Rest we at home? the Masty fierce in force, Th'vntamed Bull, the hot courageous Horse, With teeth, with horns, and hooues besiege vs round, As griev'd to see such tyrants tread the ground: And ther's no Fly so small but now dares bring Her little wrath against her quondam King. An admirable description of Mans miserable Punishments, tortured by himselfe.What hideous sights? what horror-boading showes? Alas, what yels? what howls? what thund'ring throws? O! Am I not neer roaring Phlegeton? Alecto, sad Meger' and Thesiphon? What spels haue charm'd ye from your dreadfull den Of darkest Hell? Monsters abhord of men, O Nights black daughters, grim-faç't Furies sad, Stern Plutos Postes, what make ye heer so mad? O! feels not man a world of wofull terrors, Besides your goaring wounds and ghastly horrors? So soon as God from Eden Adam draue, To liue in this Earth (rather in this Graue, Where raign a thousand deaths) he summon'd-vp With thundering call the damned Crew, that sup Of Sulphury Styx, and fiery Phlegeton, Bloody Cocytus, muddy Acheron. Come snake-trest Sisters, com ye dismall Elves, Cease now to curse and cruciate your selues: Com, leaue the horror of your houses pale, Com, parbreak heer your foul, black, banefull gall: Let lack of work no more from henceforth fear-you, Man by his sin a hundred hells doth rear-you. This eccho made whole hell to tremble troubled, The drowsie Night her deep dark horrors doubled, And suddainly Auernus Gulf did swim With Rozin, Pitch, and Brimstone to the brim, And th'vgly Gorgons, and the Sphinxes fel, Hydraes and Harpies gan to yawn and yel. As the heat, hidden in a vapoury Cloud, Striuing for issue with strange murmurs loud, Like Guns astuns, with round-round-rumbling thunder Filling the Ayr with noyse, the Earth with wonder: So the three Sisters, the three hideous Rages, Raise thousand storms, leaving th'infernal stages. Already all rowle-on their steely Cars The Fvries with their funiture and tranie, representing the Horror of Sinne, and the cursed estate of an euill conscience. On th'ever-shaking nine-fould steely bars Of Stygian Bridge, and in that fearefull Caue They iumble, tumble, rumble, rage and raue. Then dreadfull Hydra, and dire Cerberus Which on one body, beareth (monsterous) The heads of Dragon, Dog, Ounse, Bear, and Bull, Wolf, Lion, Horse (of strength and stomack full) Lifting his lungs, he hisses, barks and brays, He howls, he yels, he bellows, roars, and neighs: Such a black Sant, such a confused sound From many-headed bodies doth rebound. Hauing attain'd to our calm Hav'n of light, With swifter course then Boreas nimble flight, All fly at Man, all at intestine strife, Who most may torture his detested life. Heer first coms Dearth, the liuely form of Death, 1 Description of Famine with her traine. Still yawning wide, with loathsom stinking breath, With holloweys, with meager cheeks and chin, With sharp lean bones pearcing her sable skin: Her empty bowels may be plainly spy'd Clean through the wrinkles of her withered hide: She hath no belly, but the bellies seat, Her knees and knuckles swelling hugely great: Insatiate Orque, that even at one repast, Almost all creatures in the World would waste; Whose greedy gorge, dish after dish doth draw, Seeks meat in meat. For, still her monstrous maw Voyds in deuouring, and somtimes she eates Her own deer Babes for lack of other meats: Nay more, sometimes (O strangest gluttony!) She eats her selfe, her selfe to satisfie; Lessening her self, her selfe so to inlarge: And cruell thus she doth our Grand-sire charge; And brings besides from Limbo, to assist-her, Rage, Feeblenes, and Thirst, her ruth-less sister. Next marcheth Warr, the mistriss of enormity, 2 Of Warre and her traine. Mother of mischiefe, monster of Deformity: Laws, Manners, Arts, shee breaks, she mars, she chaces: Blood, tears, bowrs, towrs; she spils, swils, burns, and razes: Her brazen feet shake all the Earth asunder, Her mouth's a fire-brand, and her voice a thunder, Her looks are lightnings, every glaunce a flash: Her fingers guns, that all to powder pash. Fear and Despaire, Flight and Disorder, coast With hasty march, before her murderous hoast: As, Burning, Waste, Rape, Wrong, Impiety, Rage, Ruine, Discord, Horror, Cruelty, Sack, Sacriledge, Impunity, and Pride, Are still stern consorts by her barbarous side: And Pouerty, Sorrow, and Desolation, Follow her Armies bloody transmigration. 3 Sicknes exactly described with all her partakers and dependers.Heer's th'other Fvrie (or my iudgement fails) Which furiously mans wofull life assails With thousand Cannons, sooner felt then seen, Where weakest strongest; fraught with deadly teen: Blinde, crooked, cripple, maymed, deaf, and mad, Cold-burning, blistered, melancholik, sad, Many-nam'd poyson, minister of Death, Which from vs creeps, but to vs gallopeth: Foul, trouble-rest, fantastik, greedy-gut, Blood-sweating, hearts-theef, wretched, filthy Slut, The Childe of Surfait, and Ayrs-temper vicious, Perillous knowen, but vnknowne most pernitious. Innumerable kindes of diseases.Th'inammeld meads, in Sommer cannot showe More Grashoppers aboue, nor Frogs belowe, Then hellish murmurs heer about doe ring: Nor never did the prety little King Of Hony-people, in a Sun-shine day Lead to the field in orderly array More busie buzzers, when he casteth (witty) The first foundations of his waxen Citty; Then this fierce Monster musters in her train Fel Souldiers, charging poor mankind amain. Lo, first a rough and furious Regiment T'assault the Fort of Adams head is sent, Reasons best Bulwark, and the holy Cell Wherein the soules most sacred powers dwell. The first Regiment sent to assaile the Head, Man's chiefest fortresse. Simile.A King, that ayms his neighbours Crown to win, Before the brute of open warrs begin, Corrupts his Councell with rich recompences; For, in good Councell stands the strength of Princes: So this fell Fury, for fore-runners, sends Manie and Phrenzie to suborne her frends: Whereof, th'one drying, th'other over-warming The feeble brain (the edge of iudgement harming) Within the Soule fantastikly they fain A confus'd hoast of strange Chimeraes vain, The Karos th'Apoplexie, and Lethargie, As forlorn hope, assault the enemy On the same side; but yet with weapons others: For, they freez-vp the brain and all his brothers; Making a liue man like a liue-less carcass, Saue that again he scapeth from the Parcas. And now the Palsie, and the Cramp dispose Their angry darts; this bindes, and that doth lose Mans feeble sinews, shutting vp the way Whereby before the vitall spirits did play. A similitude of the effects and endeuors of sicknesse. Then as a man, that fronts in single Fight His suddain foe, his ground doth trauerse light, Thrusts, wards, auoids and best advantage spies, At last (to daze his Riuals sparkling eyes) He casts his Cloak, and then with coward knife, In crimsin streams he makes him strain his life: So Sicknes, Adam to subdue the better (Whom thousand Gyues al-ready fastly fetter) Brings to the field the faith-less Ophthalmy With scalding blood to blind her enemy, Darting a thousand thrusts; then she is backt By th'Amafrose and cloudy Cataract, That (gathering-vp gross humors inwardly In th'Optike sinnew) clean puts out the ey: This other caseth in an enuious caul The Crystall humour shining in the ball. This past: in-steps that insolent insulter, The cruell Quincy, leaping like a Vulture At Adams throat, his hollow weasand swelling Among the muscles, through thick bloods congealing, Leauing him onely this Essay, for signe Of's might and malice to his future-line: Like Hercules, that in his infant-browes Bore glorious marks of his vndaunted prowes, When with his hands (like steely tongs) he strangled His spightfull stepdams Dragons spotty-spangled; A proof, præsaging the tryumphant spoyls That he atchiv'd by his Twelue famous Toyls. The second Regiment with deadly darts The second Regiment assaulting the vitall Parts. Assaulteth fiercely Adam's vitall parts: Al-ready th'Asthma, panting, breathing tough, With humors gross the lifting Lungs doth stuff: The pining Phthisick fills them all with pushes, Whence a slowe spowt of cor'sie matter gushes: A wasting flame the Peripneumony Within those spunges kindles cruelly: The spawling Empiem, ruth-less as the rest, With foul impostumes fils his hollow chest: The Pleurisie stabs him with desperate foyl Beneath the ribs, where scalding blood doth boyl: Then th'Incubus (by some suppos'd a spright) With a thick phlegm doth stop his breath by night. The Ague with her train, her kinde and cruell effects. Deer Muse, my guide; cleer truth that nought dissembles, Name me that Champion that with fury trembles, Who arm'd with blazing fire-brands, fiercely flings At th'Armies heart, not at our feeble wings: Hauing for Aids, Cough, Head-ache, Horror, Heat, Pulse-beating, Burning, cold-distilling-Sweat, Thirst, Yawning, Yolking, Casting, Shiuering, Shaking, Fantastick Rauing, and continuall Aking, With many mo: O! is not this the Fury We call the Feuer? whose inconstant fury Transforms her ofter then Vertumnus can, To Tertian, Quartan, and Quotidian, And Second too; now posting, somtimes pawsing, Euen as the matter, all these changes causing, Is rommidged with motions slowe or quick In feeble bodies of the Ague-sick. Our Poet, hauing been himselfe for many yeers grieuously afflicted with the Feuer, complaineth bitterly of her rude violence.Ah trecherous beast! needs must I knowe thee best: For foure whole years thou wert my poor harts guest, And to this day in body and in minde I beare the marks of thy despight vnkind: For yet (besides my veins and bones bereft Of blood and marrow) through thy secret theft I feel the vertue of my spirit decayd, Th'Enthousiasmos of my Muse allaid: My memory (which hath been meetly good) Is now (alas!) much like the fleeting flood; Whereon no sooner haue we drawn a line But it is canceld, leauing there no signe: For, the deere fruit of all my care and cost, My former study (almost all) is lost, And oft in secret haue I blushed at Mine ignorance: like Coruine, who forgat His proper name; or like George Trapezunce (Learned in youth, and in his age a Dunce). And thence it growes, that maugre my endeuour My Numbers still by habite haue the Feuer; One-while with heat of heauenly fire ensoul'd; Shivering anon, through faint vn-learned cold. The third Regiment warring on the naturall Powers.Now, the third Regiment with stormy stours Sets-on the Squadron of our Naturall Powers, Which happily maintain vs (duly) both With needfull food, and with sufficient growth. One-while the Boulime, then the Anorexie, Then the Dog-hunger, or the Bradypepsie, And childe-great Pica (of prodigious diet) In straightest stomacks rage with monstrous ryot: Then on the Liver doth the Iaundize fall, Stopping the passage of the cholerick Gall; Which then, for good blood, scatters all about Her fiery poyson, yellowing all without: But the sad Dropsie freezeth it extream, Till all the blood be turned into fleam. But see (alas!) by far more cruell foes The slippery bowels thrill'd with thousand throes: With prisoned windes the wringing Colick pains-them, The Iliack passion with more rigour strains-them, Streightens their Conduits, and (detested) makes Mans mouth (alas!) euen like a lothsom Iakes. Then, the Dysentery with fretting pains Extorteth pure blood from the flayed veins. On th'other side, the Stone and Strangury, Torturing the Reins with deadly tyranny, With heat-concreted sand-heaps strangely stop The burning vrine, strained drop by drop: As opposite, the Diabete by melting Our bodies substance in our Vrine swelting, Distills vs still, as long as any matter Vnto the spout can send supply of water. Vnto those parts, wherby we leaue behind-vs Types of our selues in after-times to mind-vs, There fiercely flies defectiue Venery, And the foul, feeble, fruit-less Gonorrhe (An impotence for Generations-deed, And lust-less Issue of th'vncocted seed) Remorse-less tyrants, that to spoyl aspire Babes vnconceiv'd in hatred of their Sire. The fell fourth Regiment, is outward Tumours The fourth Regiment forrageth, and detaceth the Body our waraly. Begot of vicious indigested humours: As Phlegmons, Oedems, Schyrrhes, Erysipiles, Kings-euils, Cankers, cruell Gouts, and Byles, Wens, Ring-worms, Tetters: these from euery part With thousand pangs braue the besieged hart: And their blind fury, wanting force and courage To hurt the Fort, the champain Country forrage. O tyrants! sheath your feeble swords again: For, Death al-ready thousand-times hath slain Your Enemy; and yet your enuious rigour Doth mar his feature and his limbs disfigure. And with a dull and ragged instrument His ioynts and skin are saw'd, and torn, and rent. Methinks most rightly to a coward Crew Comparison. Of Wolues and Foxes I resemble you, Who in a Forrest (finding on the sand The Lyon dead, that did aliue command The Land about, whose awfull Countenance Melted, far off, their yce-like arrogance) Mangle the members of their liue-less Prince, With feeble signes of dastard insolence. The Lowzie Disease.But, with the Griefs that charge our outward places, Shall I account the loathsome Phthiriasis? O shamefull Plague! O foul infirmitie! Which makes proud Kings, fouler then Beggers be (That wrapt in rags, and wrung with vermin sore, Their itching backs sit shrugging euermore) To swarm with Lice, that rubbing cannon rid, Nor often shift of shirts, and sheets, and bed: For, as in springs, stream stream pursueth fresh, Swarm follows swarm, and their too fruitfull flesh Breeds her own eaters, and (till Deaths arrest) Makes of it selfe an execrable feast. Diseases proper to certaine Climats &amp; Nati?s.Nor may we think, that Chance confusedly Conducts the Camp of our Third Enemy: For, of her Souldiers, som (as led by reason) Can make their choice of Country, Age, and Season. So Portugall hath Phthisiks most of all, Eber Kings-euils; Arne the Suddain Fall; Sauoy the Mumps; West-India, Pox; and Nyle The Leprosie; Plague, the Sardinian-Ile, After the influence of the Heav'ns all ruling, To som ages of man.Or Countries manners. So, soft Child-hood puling Is wrung with Worms, begot of crudity, Are apt to I aske through much humidity: Through their salt phlegms, their heads are hid with skalls, Their Limbs with Red-gums and with bloody balls Of Menstruall humour which (like Must) within Their bodies boyling buttoneth all their Skin. To bloody-Flixes, Youth is apt inclining, Continuall-Feuers, Phrenzies, Phthisik-pyning. And feeble Age is seldom-times without Her tedious guests, the Palsie and the Gout, Coughes and Catarrhs. And so the Pestilence, The quartan-Ague with her accidents, To the Seasons of the yeare.The Flix, the Hip-gout, and the Watry-Tumour, Are bred with vs of an Autumnal humour: The Itch, the Murrein, and Alcides-grief, In Ver's hot-moysture doe molest vs chief: The Diarrhœa and the Burning-Feuer, In Sommer-season doo their fell endevour: And Pleurisies, the rotten-Coughes, and Rheums, Wear curled flakes of white celestiall plumes: Like sluggish Souldiers, keeping Garrison In th'ycie Bulwarks of the Years gelt Son. Some Diseases contagious.Som, seeming most in multitudes delighting, Bane one by other, not the first acquiting: As Measels, Mange, and filthy Leprosie, The Plague, the Pox, and Phthisik-maladie. And some (alas!) we leaue as in succession, Some hæreditarie. Vnto our Children, for a sad possession: Such are Kings-euils, Dropsie, Gout, and Stone, Blood-boyling Lepry, and Consumption, The swelling Throat-ache, th'Epilepsie sad, And cruell Rupture, payning too-too bad: For, their hid poysons after-comming harm Is fast combin'd vnto the Parents sperm. But O! what arms, what shield shall we oppose, Some not known by their Cause, but by their Effects only. What stratagems against those treacherous foes, Those trecherous griefs, that our frail Art detects Not by their cause, but by their sole effects? Such are the fruitfull Matrix suffocation, The Falling-sicknes, and pale Swouning-passion; The which, I wote not what strange windes long pause, I wot not where, I wote not how doth cause. Or who (alas!) can scape the cruell wile Some by sundry Causes encreasing and waxing worse. Of those fell Pangs that Physicks pains beguile? Which beeing banisht from a body, yet (Vnder new names) return again to it: Or rather, taught the strange Metempsychosis Of the wise Samian, one it self transposes Into som worse Griefe; either through the kindred Of th'humour vicious, or the member hindred: Or through their ignorance or auarice That doe profess Apollos exercise. So, Melancholy turned into Madnes: Pro the Palsie, deep-affrighted Sadnes; Th'Il-habitude into the Dropsie chill: And Megrim growes to the Comitial-Ill. In brief, poor Adam in this pitious case Comparison. Is like a Stag, that long pursu'd in chase, Flying for succour to some neighbour wood, Sinks on the suddain in the yeelding mud; And sticking fast amid the rotten grounds, Is over-taken by the eger Hounds: One bites his back, his neck another nips, One puls his brest, at's throat another skips, One tugs his flank, his haunch another tears, Another lugs him by the bleeding ears; And last of all, the Wood-man with his knife Cuts off his head, and so concludes his life. Or like a lusty Bull, whose horned Crest Another comparison. Awakes fell Hornets from their drowsie nest, Who buzzing forth, assaile him on each side, And pitch their valiant Bands about his hide; With fisking train, with forked head, and foot, Himselfe, th'ayre, th'earth, he beateth (to no boot) Flying (through woods, hills, dales, and roaring rivers) His place of griefe, but not his painfull grievers: And in the end, stitcht full of stings he dies, Or on the ground as dead (at least) he lies. An amplification of Mans miseries, compared with other Creatures seldomer sick, &amp; sooner healed: &amp; that by naturall Remedies of their owne: hauing also taught Men many practices of Physike.For, man is loaden with ten thousand languors: All other Creatures, onely feele the angors Of few Diseases: as, the gleaning Quail Onely the Falling-sicknes doth assail: The Turn-about and Murrain trouble Cattel, Madnes and Quincie bid the Masty battel. Yet each of them can naturally find What Simples cure the sickness of their kind; Feeling no sooner their disease begin, But they as soon haue ready medicine. The Ram for Physick takes strong-senting Rue, The Tortois slowe, cold Hemlock doth renue: The Partridge, Black-bird, and rich painted Iay. Haue th'oyly liquour of the sacred Bay. The sickly Beare, the Mandrak cures again; And Mountain-Siler helpeth Goats to yean: But, we know nothing, till by poaring still On Books, we get vs a Sophistik skill; A doubtfull Art, a Knowledge still vnknowen: Which enters but the hoary heads (alone) Of those, that (broken with vnthankfull toyl) Seek others Health, and lose their own the-while: Or rather those (such are the greatest part) That waxing rich at others cost and smart, Growe famous Doctors, purchasing promotions, While the Church-yards swel with their hurtfull potions; Who (hang-man like) fear-less, aed shame-less too, Are prayd and payd for murders that they doo. I speak not of the good, the wise, and learned, Within whose hearts Gods fear is well discerned; Who to our bodies can again vnite Our parting soules, ready to take their flight. For, these I honour as Heav'ns gifts excelling, Pillars of Health, Death and Disease repelling: Th'Almighties Agents, Natures Counsellers, And flowring Youths wise faithfull Governours. Yet if their Art can ease some kinde of dolors, They learn'd it first of Natures silent Schollers: For, from the Sea-Horse came Phlebotomies, From the wild Goat the healing of the eys; From Stork and Hearn, our Glysters laxatiue, From Beares and Lions Diets wee deriue. 'Gainst th'onely Body, all these Champions stout Striue; some, within: and other some, without. Or, if that any th'all-fair Soule haue striken, 'Tis not directly; but, in that they weaken Her Officers, and spoyle the Instruments Wherwith she works such wonderous presidents. But, lo! foure Captains far more fierce and eger, Of foure Diseases of the Soule, vnder them comprehending all the rest. That on all sides the Spirit it selfe beleaguer, Whose Constancy they shake, and soon by treason Draw the blind Iudgement from the rule of Reason: Opinions issue; which (though selfe vnseen) Make through the Body their fell motions seen. Sorrow's first Leader of this furious Crowd, 1 Sorrow described with her company. Muffled all-over in a sable clowd, Old before Age, afflicted night and day, Her face with wrinkles warped every-way, Creeping in corners, where she sits and vies Sighes from her hart, tears from her blubbered eys; Accompani'd with selfe-consuming Care, With weeping Pity, Thought, and mad Despaire That bears, about her, burning Coales and Cords, Asps, poysons, Pistols, Halters, Kniues, and Swords: Foul squinting Envy, that self-eating Elf, Through others leanness fatting vp herself, Ioying in mischiefe, feeding but with languor And bitter tears her Toad-like-swelling anger: And Ielousie that never sleeps, for fear (Suspicions Flea still nibbling in her ear) That leaues repast and rest, neer pin'd and blinde With seeking what she would be loth to finde. The second Captain is excessiue Ioy: 2 Ioy with her Traine. Who leaps and tickles, finding th'Apian-way Too streight for her: whose senses all possess All wished pleasures in all plentiousnes. She hath in conduct false vain-glorious Vaunting, Bold, soothing, shameless, lowd, iniurious, taunting: The winged Giant lofty-staring Pride, That in the clouds her brauing Crest doth hide: And many other, like the empty bubbles That rise when raine the liquid Crystall troubles. The Third, is blood-less, hart-less, witless Feare, 3 Feare &amp; her Followers. That like an Asp-tree trembles every-where: She leads black Terror, and base clownish Shame, And drowsie Sloath, that counterfaiteth lame, With Snail-like motion measuring the ground, Having her arms in willing fetters bound, Foul, sluggish Drone, barren (but, sin to breed) Diseased, begger, starv'd with wilfull need. And thou Desire, whom nor the firmament, 4 Desire, a most violent Passion, accompanied with others like: as Ambition, Auarice, Anger, and Foolish Loue. Nor ayr, nor earth, nor Ocean can content: Whose-looks are hookes, whose belly's bottom-less, Whose hands are Gripes to scrape with greediness, Thou art the Fourth: and vnder thy Command, Thou bringst to field a rough vnruly Band: First, secret-burning, mighty-swoln Ambition Pent in no limits, pleas'd with no Condition, Whom Epicurus many Worlds suffice not, Whose furious thirst of proud aspiring dies not, Whose hands (transported with fantastike passion) Bear painted Scepters in imagination: Then Auarice all-arm'd in hooking Tenters And clad in Bird-lime; without bridge she venters Through fell Charybdis, and false Syrtes Nesse; The more her wealth, the more her wretchedness: Cruel, respect-less, friendless, faith-less Elf, That hurts her neighbour, but much more her self: Whose foule base fingers in each dunghill poar (Like Tantalus) starv'd in the midst of store: Not what she hath, but what she wants she counts: A wel-wingd Bird that neuer lofty mounts. Then, boyling Wrath, stern, cruell, swift, and rash, That like a Boar her teeth doth grinde and gnash: Whose hair doth stare, like bristled Porcupine; Who som-times rowles her ghastly-glowing eyn, And som-time fixtly on the ground doth glaunce, Now bleak, then bloody in her Countenance; Rauing and rayling with a hideous sound, Clapping her hands, stamping against the ground; Bearing Bocconi, fire and sword to slay, And murder all that for her pitty pray; Baning her self, to bane her Enemy; Disdaining Death, prouided others dy: Like falling Towers o'r-turned by the winde, That break themselues on that they vnder-grinde. And then that Tyrant, all-controuling Loue: (Whom heer to paint doth little me behooue, After so many rare Apetleses As in this Age our Albion nourishes) And to be short, thou doest to battail bring As many Souldiers 'gainst the Creatures King, (Yet not his owne) as in this life, Mankinde True very Goods, or seeming-Goods doth finde. Now, if (but like the Lightning in the sky) These sudden Passions past but swiftly by, The fear were less: but, O! too-oft they leaue Keen stings behinde in Soules thar they deceiue. The horrible effects of the Passions of the soule far more dangerous then the diseases of the body.From this foul Fountain, all these poysons rise, Rapes, Treasons, Murders, Incests, Sodomies, Blaspheaming, Bibbing, Theeuing, False-contracting, Church-chaffering, Cheating, Bribing, and Exacting. Alas! how these (far-worse then death) Diseases Exceed each Sickness that our body seises; Which makes vs open war, and by his spight Giues to the Patient many a holsom light, Now by the colour, or the Pulses beating, Or by som Fit, som sharper dolor threatning; Whereby, the Leach neer-ghessing at our grief, Not seldom findes sure meanes for our relief. But, for the Ills raign in our Intellect (Which only, them both can and ought detect) They rest vnknown, or rather self-conceal'd; And soule-sick Patients care not to be heal'd. Besides, we plainly call the Feuer, Feuer: The Dropsie, Dropsie: over-gliding never, With guile-full flourish of a fained phraze, The cruell Languors that our bodies craze: Whereas, our fond self-soothing Soule, thus sick, Rubs her own sore; with glozing Rhetorick Cloaking her vice: and makes the blinded Blain Not fear the touch of Reasons Cautere vain. And sure, if ever filthy Vice did iet In sacred Vertues spot-less mantle neat, The miserable corruption of our Times, worse then all former Ages. 'Tis in our dayes, more hatefull and vnhallow'd, Then when the World the Waters wholly swallow'd. Ile spare to speak of foulest Sins, that spot Th'infamous beds of men of mighty lot; Lest I the Saints chaste tender ears offend, And seem them more to teach, then reprehend. Who bear vpon their French-sick backs about, All riotous Prodigality disguised with the name of Liberality. Farms, Castles, Fees, in golden shreads cut-out; Whose lavish hand, at one Primero-rest, One Mask, one Turney, or one pampering Feast, Spend treasures, scrap't by th'Vsurie and Care Of miser Parents; Liberall counted are. Who, with a maiden voice, and mincing pase, Effeminate curiosity &amp; luxurious Pride, miscalled Cleanlinesse. Quaint loooks, curl'd locks, perfumes, and painted face, Base coward-hart, and wanton soft array, Their man-hood only by their Beard bewray; Are Cleanly call'd. Who like Lust-greedy Goates, Insatiate lust and Beast-like Loosenes, surnamed Loue. Brothel from bed to bed; whose Siren-notes Inchant chaste Susans, and like hungry Kite Fly at all game, they Louers are behight. Who, by false bargains, and vnlawfull measures Robbing the World, haue heaped kingly treasures: Extream Extortion scunted Thrift. Who cheat the simple; lend for fifty fifty, Hundred for hundred, are esteemed Thrifty. Blasphemous Quarrels, brauest Courage.Who alwaies murder and revenge affect, Who feed on blood, who never doe respect State, Sex, or Age: but in all humane liues In cold blood, bathe their paricidiall kniues; Inhumane Murder highest Manhood.Are stiled Valiant. Grant, good Lord, our Land May want such valour whose self-cruell hand Fights for our foes, our proper life-blood spils, Our Cities sacks, and our owne Kindred kils. Lord, let the Lance, the Gun, the Sword, and Shield, Be turn'd to tools to furrow vp the field, And let vs see the Spyders busie task Wov'n in the belly of the plumed Cask. But if (braue Lands-men) your war-thirst be such, If in your brests sad Enyon boyl so much, What holds you heer? alas! what hope of crowns? Our fields are flock-less, treasure-less our Towns. Goe then, nay run, renowned Martialists, Re-found French-Greece, in now-Natolian lists; Hy, hy to Flanders; free with conquering stroak Your Belgian brethren from th'Iberians yoak: To Portugal; people Galizian-Spain, And graue your names on Lysbon's gates again. FINIS. The Handy-Crafts. THE IIII. PART OF THE FIRST DAY OF THE II. WEEK. The Argvment. The Praise of Peace, the miserable states Of Edens Exiles: their vn-curious Cates, Their simple habit, silly habitation: They find out Fire. Their formost Propagation: Their Childrens trades, their offerings; enuious Cain His (better) Brother doth vnkindly brain: With inward horror hurried vp and down, He breakes a Horse, he builds a homely Town: Iron's inuented, and sweet Instruments: Adam fortels of After-Worlds euents. Heav'ns sacred Imp, fair Goddess that renew'st The Poet here welcomes peace which (after long absence) seems about this time to haue returned into France. The Benefites she brings with her. Th'old golden Age, and brightly now re-blew'st Our cloudy skie, making our fields to smile: Hope of the vertuous, horror of the vile: Virgin, vnseen in France this many a yeer, O blessed Peace! we bid thee welcom heer. Lo, at thy presence, how who late were prest To spur their Steeds, and couch their staues in rest For fierce incounter; cast away their spears, And rapt with ioy, them enter-bathe with tears. Lo, how our Marchant-vessels to and fro Freely about-our trade-full waters go: How the graue Senate with iust-gentle rigour, Resumes his Robe; the Laws their antient vigour. Lo, how Obliuions Seas our striefes do drown: How walls are built that war had thundred down: Lo, how the Shops with busie Crafts-men swarm; How Sheep and Cattell cover every Farm: Behold the Bonfires waving to the skies: Hark, hark the cheerfull and re-chanting cries Of old and young; singing this ioyfull Dittie, Thanks-giuing to God for peace.Iö reioyce, reioyce through Town and Cittie, Let all our ayr, re-eccho with the praises Of th'everlasting glorious God, who raises Our ruin'd State: who giveth vs a good We sought not for (or rather, we with-stood): So that to hear and see these consequences Of wonders strange, we scarce beleeue our senses. O! let the King, let Mounsieur and the Sover'n Gratefull rem?brance of the means thereof.That doth Nauarras Spain wrongd Scepter gouern, Be all, by all, their Countries Fathers cleapt: O! let the honour of their names be kept, And on brass leaues ingrav'n eternally In the bright Temple of fair Memory, For having quencht, so soon, so many fires, Disarm'd our arms, appeas'd the heav'nly ires, Calm'd the pale horror of intestine hates, And dammed-vp the bifront Fathers gates. Much more, let vs (deer, World-diuided land) Extoll the mercies of Heav'ns mighty hand, That (while the World; Wars bloody rage hath rent) To vs so long, so happy Peace hath lent (Maugre the malice of th'Italian Priest, And Indian Pluto (prop of Anti-christ; Whose Hoast, like Pharaoh's threatning Israel, Our gaping Seas haue swallowed quick to hell) Making our Ile a holy Safe-Retrait For saints exil'd in persecutions heat. An imitation thereof, by the Translator, in honour of our late gracious Souerain Elizabeth: in whose happy Raigne God hath giuen this Kingdom so long peace and rich prosperitie.Much more, let vs with true-heart-tuned breath, Record the Praises of Elizabeth (Our martiall Pallas and our milde Astræa, Of grace and wisdom the divine Idea) Whose prudent Rule, with rich religious rest, Wel-neer nine Lustres hath this Kingdom blest. O! pray we him that from home-plotted dangers And bloody threats of proud ambitious Strangers, So many years hath so securely kept her, In iust possession of this flowring Scepter; That (to his glory and his deer Sons honour) All happy length of life may wait vpon her: That we her Subiects, whom he blesseth by her, Psalming his praise, may sound the same the higher. But waiting (Lord) in som more learned Layes, To sing thy glory, and my Soueraigns praise; I sing the young Worlds Cradle, as a Proëm Vnto so rare and so diuine a Poëm. Who, Fvll Of wealth and honours blandishment, An Elegant c?parison representing the lamentable condition of Adam and Eue driuen out of Paradise. Among great Lords his yonger yeares hath spent; And quaffing deply of the Court-delights, Vs'd nought but Tilts, Turneis, and Masks, and Sights: If in his age, his Princes angry doom With deep disgrace driue him to liue at home In homely Cottage, where continually The bitter smoak exhales aboundantly From his before-vn-sorrow-drained brain The brackish vapours of a silver rain: Where Vsher-less, both day and night, the North, South, East, and West windes, enter and goe forth: Where round-about, the lowe-rooft broken wals (In stead of Arras) hang with Spiders cauls: Where all at once he reacheth, as he stands, With brows the roof, both wals with both his hands: He weeps and sighs, and (shunning comforts ay) Wisheth pale Death a thousand times a day: And, yet at length falling to work, is glad To bite a brown crust that the Mouse hath had, And in a Dish (for want of Plate or Glass) Sups Oaten drink in stead of Hypocras. So (or much like) our rebell Elders, driven For ay from Eden (earthly type of Heav'n) Ly languishing neer Tigris grassie side, With nummed limbs, and spirits stupefied. But powrfull Need (Arts ancient Dame and Keeper, The first Maner of life. The early watch-clock of the sloathfull sleeper) Among the Mountains makes them seek their living, And foaming rivers, through the champain driving: For yet the Trees with thousand fruits yfraught In formall Checkers were not fairly brought: The Pear and Apple liued Dwarf-like there, With Oakes and Ashes shadowed every-where: And yet (alas!) their meanest simple cheer Our wretched Parents bought full hard and deer. To get a Plum, somtimes poor Adam rushes With thousand wounds among a thousand bushes. If they desire a Medlar for their food, They must go seek it through a fearfull wood; Or a brown Mulbery, then the ragged Bramble With thousand scratches doth their Skin bescramble. Wherefore (as yet) more led by th'appetite. Great simplicity in their kinde of life. Of th'hungry belly then the tastes delight, Living from hand to mouth, soon satisfi'd, To earn their supper, th'after-noon they ply'd, Vnstor'd of dinner till the morrow-day; Pleas'd with an Apple, or som lesser pray. Then, taught by Ver (richer in flowrs then fruit) And hoary Winter, of both destitute, Nuts, Filberds, Almonds, wisely vp they hoord, The best provisions that the woods affoord. Their Cloathing.Touching their garments: for the shining wooll Whence the roab-spinning pretious Worms are full, For gold and silver wov'n in drapery, For Cloth dipt double in the scarlet Dy, For Gemms bright lustre, with excessiue cost On rich embroideries by rare Art embost; Somtimes they doe the far-spread Gourd vnleaue, Somtime the Fig-tree of his branch bereaue: Somtimes the Plane, somtimes the Vine they shear, Choosing their fairest tresses heer and there: And with their sundry locks, thorn'd each to other, Their tender limbs they hide from Cynthias Brother. Somtimes the Iuie's climing stems they strip, Which lovingly his liuely prop doth clip: And with green lace, in artificiall order, The wrinkled bark of th'Acorn-Tree doth border, And with his arms th'Oaks slender twigs entwining, A many branches in one tissue ioyning, Frames a loose Iacquet, whose light nimble quaking, Wagg'd by the windes, is like the wanton shaking Of golden spangles, that in stately pride Dance on the tresses of a noble Bride. But, while that Adam (waxen diligent) Wearies his limbs for mutuall nourishment: While craggy Mountains, Rocks, and thorny Plains, And bristly Woods be witness of his pains; Eue, walking forth about the Forrests, gathers Speights, Parrots, Peacocks, Estrich scattered feathers, And then with wax the smaller plumes she sears, And sowes the greater with a white horse hairs, (For they as yet did serue her in the steed Of Hemp, and Towe, and Flax, and Silk, and Threed) And thereof makes a medly coat so rare That it resembles Nature's Mantle fair, When in the Sunne, in pomp all glistering, She seems with smiles to woo the gawdie Spring. When (by stoln moments) this she had contriv'd, Leaping for ioy, her cheerfull looks reviv'd, Sh' admires her cunning; and incontinent 'Sayes on her selfe her manly ornament; And then through path-less paths she runs apace, To meet her husband comming from the Chase. Sweet-heart, quoth she (and then she kisseth him) My Loue, my Life, my Bliss, my Ioy, my Gem, My soules deer Soule, take in good part (I pree-thee) This pretty Present that I gladly giue-thee. Thanks my deer All (quoth Adam then) for this, And with three kisses he requites her kiss. Then on he puts his painted garment new, And Peacock-like himselfe doth often view, Looks on his shadow, and in proud amaze Eues industrie in making a Garment for her Husband. Admires the hand that had the Art to cause So many severall parts to meet in one, To fashion thus the quaint Mandilion. But, when the Winters keener breath began To crystallize the Baltike Ocean, To glaze the Lakes, and bridle-vp the Floods, And perriwig with wooll the bald-pate Woods; Our Grand-sire, shrinking, gan to shake and shiver, His teeth to chatter, and his beard to quiver. Spying therefore a flock of Muttons comming (Whose freez-clad bodies feel not Winters numming) He takes the fairest, and he knocks it down: Then by good hap, finding vpon the Down A sharp great fishbone (which long time before The roaring flood had cast vpon the shore) He cuts the throat, flayes it, and spreads the fell, Then dries it, pares it, and he scrapes it well, Their winter sutes. Then cloathes his wife therewith; and of such hides Slops, Hats, and Doublets for himselfe provides. A vaulted Rock, a hollow Tree, a Caue, Their lodging and first building. Were the first buildings that them shelter gaue: But, finding th'one to be too-moist a hold, Th'other too-narrow, th'other over-cold; Like Carpenters, within a Wood they choose Sixteen fair Trees that never leaues do loose, Whose equall front in quadran form prospected, As if of purpose Nature them erected: Their shady boughs first bow they tenderly, Then enterbraid, and binde them curiously; That one would think that had this Arbor seen, 'T had been true seeling painted-over green. After this triall, better yet to fence Their tender flesh from th'ayry violence, Vpon the top of their fit-forked stems, They lay a-crosse bare Oken boughs for beams A building som-what more exact. (Such as dispersed in the Woods they finde, Torn-off in tempests by the stormy winde) Then these again with leauy boughes they load, So covering close their sorry cold abode, And then they ply from th'eaues vnto the ground, With mud-mixt Reed to wall their mansion round, All saue a hole to th'Eastward situate, Where straight they clap a hurdle for a gate (In steed of hinges hanged on a With) Which with a sleight both shuts and openeth. The inuention of Fire.Yet fire they lackt: but lo, the winds, that whistle Amid the Groues, so oft the Laurell iustle Against the Mulbery, that their angry claps Do kindle fire, that burns the neighbour Cops. When Adam saw a ruddy vapour rise In glowing streame; astund with fear he flies, It followes him, vntill a naked Plain The greedy fury of the flame restrain: Then back he turns, and comming somwhat nigher The kindled shrubs, perceiving that the fire Dries his dank Cloathes, his Colour doth refresh, And vnbenums his sinews and his flesh; By th'vnburnt end, a good big brand he takes, And hying home a fire he quickly makes, And still maintains it, till the starry Twins Celestiall breath another fire begins. But, Winter being comn again it griev'd him; T'haue lost so fondly what so much reliev'd him, Trying a thousand waies, sith now no more The iustling Trees his domage would restore. How the first Man inuented Fire for the vse of himselfe and his posterity.While (else-where musing) one day he sate down Vpon a steep Rocks craggy-forked crown, A foaming beast come toward him he spies, Within whose head stood burning coals for eyes; Then suddenly with boisterous armes he throwes A knobby flint, that hummeth as it goes; Hence flies the beast, th'ill-aimed flint-shaft grounding Against the Rock, and on it oft rebounding, Shivers to cinders, whence there issued Small sparks of fire no sooner born then dead. This happy chance made Adam leap for glee: And quickly calling his cold company, In his left hand a shining flint he locks, Which with another in his right he knocks So vp and down, that from the coldest stone At every stroak small fiery sparkles shone. Then with the dry leaues of a withered Bay The which together handsomly they lay, They take the falling fire, which like a Sun Shines cleer and smoak-less in the leaf begun. Eue, kneeling down, with hand her head sustaining, And on the lowe ground with her elbowe leaning, Blowes with her mouth: and with her gentle blowing Stirs vp the heat, that from the dry leaues glowing Kindles the Reed, and then that hollow kix First fires the small, and they the greater sticks. And now, Man-kinde with fruitfull Race began Beginning of Families. A litle corner of the World to man: First Cain is born, to tillage all adicted; Then Abel, most to keeping flocks affected. The seuerall Occupations of Abel &amp; Cain. Abel, desirous still at hand to keep His Milk and Cheese, vnwildes the gentle Sheep To make a Flock; that when it tame became For guard and guide should haue a Dog and Ram. Cain, more ambitious, giues but little ease To's boistrous limbs: and seeing that the Pease, And other Pulse, Beans, Lentils, Lupins, Rïce, Burnt in the Copses as not held in price, Som grains he gathers: and with busie toyl, A-part hee sowes them in a better soyl; Which first he rids of stones, and thorns, and weeds, Then buries there his dying-living seeds. By the next Haruest, finding that his pain On this small plot was not ingrately vain; To break more ground, that bigger Crop may bring Without so often weary labouring, He tames a Heifer, and on either side, On either horn a three-fold twist he ty'd Of Osiar twigs, and for a-Plough he got The horn or tooth of som Rhinocerot. Now, th'one in Cattle, th'other rich in grain, Their sacrifice. On two steep Mountains build they Altars twain; Where (humbly-sacred) th'one with zealous cry Cleaues bright Olympus starry Canopy: With fained lips, the other low'd-resounded Hart-wanting Hymns, on self-deseruing founded: Each on his Altar offereth to the Lord The best that eithers flocks, or fields affoords. Rein-searching God, thought-sounding Iudge, that tries God regardeth Abel and his Sacrifice, and reiecteth Cain and his: wheras Cain enuieth, and finally kils his Brother; whose blood God reuengeth. The will and heart more then the work and guise, Accepts good Abels gift: but hates the other Profane oblation of his furious brother; Who feeling, deep th'effects of Gods displeasure, Raues, frets, and fumes, and murmurs out of measure. What boots it (Cain) O wretch! what boots it thee T'haue opened first the fruitfull womb (quoth he) Of the first mother; and first born the rather T'haue honour'd Adam first, with name of Father? Vnfortunate, what boots thee to be wealthy, Wise, actiue, valiant, strongly-limb'd, and healthy, If this weak Girl-boy, in mans shape disguis'd, To Heav'n and Earth be dear, and thou despis'd? What boots it thee, for others night and day In painfull toyl to wear thy self away: And (more for others then thine own relief) To haue deuised of all Arts the chief; If this dull Infant, of thy labour nurst, Shall reap the glory of thy deeds (accurst)? Nay, rather quickly rid thee of the fool, Down with his climbing hill, and timely cool This kindling flame: and that none over-crowe thee, Re-seise the right that Birth and Vertue owe thee. Ay in his minde this counsail he revolues: And hundred times to act it he resolues, And yet as of relents; stopt worthily By the pains horror, and sins tyranny. But, one day drawing with dissembled loue His harm-less brother far into a Groue, Vpon the verdure of whose virgin-boughs Bird had not pearcht, nor never Beast did brouz; With both his hands he takes a stone so huge, That in our age three men could hardly bouge, And iust vpon his tender brothers crown, With all his might he cruell casts it down. The murdred face lies printed in the mud, And lowd for vengeance cryes the martyr'd blood: The battered brains fly in the murd'rers face. The Sun, to shun this Tragike sight, a-pace Turns back his Teem: the amazed Paricide Doth all the Furies scourging whips abide: Externall terrors, and th'internall Worm A thousand kindes of living deaths do form: All day he hides him, wanders all the night, Flies his owne friends, of his own shade affright, Scarr'd with a leaf, and starting at a Sparrow, And all the World seems for his fear too-narrow. By reason of the multiplying of mankinde, the children of Adam begin to build houses for their commodity and retreat.But for his Children, born by three and three, Produce him Nephews, that still multiply With new increase; who yer their age be rife Becom great-Grand-sires in their Grand-sires life; Staying at length, he chose him out a dwelling, For woods and floods, and ayr, and soyl excelling. One fels down Firs, another of the same With crossed poles a little lodge doth frame: Another mounds it with dry wals about (And leaues a breach for passage in and out) With Turf and Furse: som others yet more grosse Their homely Sties in stead of walls inclose: Som (like the Swallow) mud and hay do mix, And that about their silly Cotes they fix: Som make their Roofs with fearn, or reeds, or rushes, And som with hides, with oase, with boughs, and bushes. He, that still fearfull, seeketh still defence, Cain thinking to find som quiet for the tempests of his consciece, begins to fortify, and build a Towne. Shortly this Hamlet to a Town augments. For, with keen Coultar having bounded (wittie) The four-fac't Rampire of his simple Citie; With stones soon gathered on the neighbour strand, And clayie morter readie there at hand, Well trod and tempered, he immures his Fort, A stately Towr erecting on the Port: Which awes his owne; and threats his enemies; Securing som-what his pale tyrannies. O Tigre! think'st thou (hellish fratricide) Because with stone-heaps thou art fortifi'd, Prince of som Peasants trained in thy tillage, And silly Kingling of a simple Village; Think'st thou to scape the storm of vengeance dread, That hangs already o'r thy hatefull head? No: wert thou (wretch) incamped at thy will On strongest top of any steepest Hill: Wert thou immur'd in triple brazen Wall, Having for aid all Creatures in this All: If skin and heart, of steel and yron were, Thy pain thou could'st not, less auoid thy fear Which chils thy bones, and runs through all thy vains, Racking thy soule with twentie thousand pains. Cain (as they say) by this deep fear disturbed, Supposeth to secure himselfe by the strength and swiftnes of a Horse, which he begins to tame. The first of all th'vntamed Courser curbed; That while about on others feet he run With dustie speed, he might his Deaths-man shun. Among a hundred braue, light, lustie, Horses (With curious ey, marking their comly forces) He chooseth one for his industrious proof, With round, high, hollow, smooth, brown, ietty hoof, Description of a gallant Horse. With Pasterns short, vpright (but yet in mean); Dry sinewie shanks; strong, flesh-less knees, and lean; With Hart-like legs, broad brest, and large behinde, With body large, smooth flanks, and double-chin'd; A crested neck bow'd like a half-bent Bowe, Whereon a long, thin, curled mane doth flowe; A firm full tail, touching the lowely ground, With dock between two fair fat buttocks drownd; A pricked ear, that rests as little space, As his light foot; a lean, bare bonny face, Thin joule, and head but of a middling size, Full, liuely-flaming, quickly rowling eyes, Great foaming mouth, hot-fuming nosthrill wide, Of Chest-nut hair, his fore-head starrifi'd, Three milky feet, a feather on his brest, Whom seav'n-years-old at the next grass he ghest. The maner how to back, to break &amp; make a good Horse.This goodly Iennet gently first he wins, And then to back him actively begins: Steady and straight he sits, turning his sight Still to the fore-part of his Palfrey light. The chafed Horse, such thrall ill-suffering, Begins to snuff, and snort, and leap, and fling; And flying swift, his fearfull Rider makes Like som vnskilfull Lad that vnder-takes Simile.To holde som ships helm, while the head-long Tyde Carries away the Vessell and her Guide; Who neer deuoured in the jawes of Death, Pale, fearfull, shivering, faint, and out of breath, A thousand times (with Heav'n erected eyes) Repents him of so bold an enterprise. But, sitting fast, less hurt then feared; Cain Boldens himselfe and his braue Beast again: Brings him to pase, from pasing to the trot, From trot to gallop: after runs him hot In full career: and at his courage smiles; And sitting still to run so many miles. The ready speed of a swift Horse presented to the Reader, in a pleasant and liuely descripti?.His pase is fair and free; his trot as light As Tigres course; as Swallows nimble flight: And his braue gallop seems as swift to goe As Biscan Darts, or shafts from Russian bowe: But, roaring Canon, from his smoaking throat, Never so speedy spews the thundring shot (That in an Army mowes whole squadrons down, And batters bulwarks of a summon'd Town) As this light Horse scuds, if he doe but feel His bridle slack, and in his side the heel: Shunning himself, his sinewie strength he stretches; Flying the earth, the flying ayr he catches, Born whirl-winde-like: he makes the trampled ground Shrink vnder him, and shake with doubling sound: And when the sight no more pursue him may, In fieldy clouds he vanisheth away. Good Horsemanship.The wise-waxt Rider, not esteeming best To take too-much now of his lusty Beast, Restraines his fury: then with learned wand The triple Corvet makes him vnderstand: With skilfull voice he gently cheers his pride, And on his neck his flattering palm doth slide: He stops him steady still, new breath to take, And in the same path brings him softly back. But th'angry Steed, rising and reaning proudly, The Co?tenance, Pride and Port of a courageous Horse, when he is chafed. Striking the stones, stamping and neighing loudly, Calls for the Combat, plunges, leaps and praunces, Befoams the path, with sparkling eys he glaunces, Champs on his burnisht bit, and gloriously His nimble fetlocks lifteth belly-high, All side-long iaunts, on either side he iustles, And's waving Crest courageously he bristles, Making the gazers glad on every side To give more room vnto his portly Pride. Cain gently shoaks him, and now sure in seat, The Dexterity of a skilfull Rider. Ambitiously seeks still som fresher feat To be more famous; one while trots the Ring, Another while he doth him backward bring, Then of all four he makes him lightly bound; And to each hand to manage rightly round; To stoop, to stop, to caper, and to swim, To dance to leap, to hold-vp any lim: And all, so don, with time-grace-ordered skill, As both had but one body and one will. Th'one for his Art no little glory gains: Th'other through practice by degrees attains Grace in his gallop, in his pase agility, Lightnes of head, and in his stop facility, Strength in his leap, and stedfast managings, Aptnes in all, and in his course new wings. The vse of Horses thus discovered, Each to his work more cheerly fetteled, Each plies his trade, and trauels for his age, Following the paths of painfull Tubal sage. While through a Forrest Tubal (with his Yew The inuention of iron. And ready quiver) did a Boar pursue, A burning Mountain from his fiery vain An yron River rowls along the Plain: The witty Huntsman, musing, thither hies, And of he wonder deeply 'gan devise. And first perceiving, that this scalding mettle, Becomming cold, in any shape would settle, And growe so hard, that with his sharpned side The firmest substance it would soon divide; He casts a hundred plots, and yer he parts He moulds the ground-work of a hundred Arts: Like as a Hound, that (following loose, behinde Comparison. His pensive Master) of a Hare doth finde; Leaves whom he loves, vpon the sent doth ply, Figs to and fro and fals in cheerfull Cry; And with vp-lifted head and nosthrill wide Winding his game, snuffs-vp the winde, his guide: A hundred wayes he measures Vale and Hill: Ears, eys, nor nose, nor foot, nor tail are still, Till in her hot Form he haue found the pray That he so long hath sought for every way. Casting of the first instruments of Iron.For, now the way to thousand works reveal'd, Which long shall liue maugre the rage of Eld: In two square creases of vnequall sises To turn to yron streamlings he devises; Cold, takes them thence: then off the dross he rakes, And this a Hammer, that an Anvill makes; And, adding tongs to these two instruments, He stores his house with yron implements: As, forks, rakes, hatchets, plough-shares, coultars, staples, Bolts, hindges, hooks, nails, whittles, spoaks and grapples; And grow'n more cunning, hollow things he formeth, He hatcheth Files, and winding Vices wormeth, He shapeth Sheers, and then a Saw indents, Then beats a Blade, and then a Lock invents. The execution vses and commodities of Iron.Happy device! we might as well want all The Elements, as this hard minerall. This, to the Plough-man, for great vses serves: This, for the Builder, Wood and Marble carves: This arms our bodies against adverse force: This clothes our backs: this rules th'vnruly Horse: This makes vs dry-shod daunce in Neptunes Hall: This brightens gold: this conquers self and all; Fift Element, of Instruments the haft; The Tool of Tools, and Hand of Handy-Craft. While (compast round with smoaking Cyclops rude, Half-naked Bronis, and Sterops swarthy-hewd, All well-neer weary) sweating Tubal stands, Hastning the hot work in their sounding hands, Inuention of Musick.No time lost Iubal: th'vn-full Harmony Of vn-even Hammers, beating diversly, Wakens the tunes that his sweet numbery soule Yer birth (som think) learn'd of the warbling Pole. Thereon he harps, and ponders in his minde, And glad and fain som Instrument would finde That in accord those discords might renew, And th'iron Anvils rattling sound ensew, And iterate the beating Hammers noise In milder notes, and with a sweeter voice. Inuention of the Lute and other instruments.It chanc't, that passing by a Pond, he found An open Tortoise lying on the ground, Within the which there nothing else remained Saue three dry sinews on the shell stiff-strained: This empty house Iubal doth gladly bear, Strikes on those strings, and lends attentiue ear; And by this mould frames the melodious Lute, That makes woods harken, and the windes be mute, The Hils to dance, the Heav'ns to retro-grade, Lions be tame, and tempests quickly vade. His Art, still waxing, sweetly marrieth His quavering fingers to his warbling breath: More little tongues to's charm-care Lute he brings, More Instruments he makes: no Eccho rings 'Mid rocky concaves of the babbling vales, And bubbling Rivers rowl'd with gentle gales, But wiery Cymbals, Rebecks sinews twin'd, Sweet Virginals, and Cornets curled winde. But Adam guides, through paths but seldom gone, While Cain and his children are busie for the World, Adam &amp; his other Sons exercise themselues in Piety &amp; Iustice and in searching the godly secrets of Nature. His other Sons to Vertues sacred throne: And chiefly Seth (set in good Abel's place) Staff of his age, and glory of his race: Him he instructeth in the waies of Verity, To worship God in spirit and sincerity: To honour Parents with a reverent aw, To train his children in religious law: To love his friends, his Country to defend, And helpfull hands to all mankinde to lend: To knowe Heav'ns course, and how their constant swaies Divide the yeer in months, the months in daies: What star brings Winter, what is Sommers guide; What signe foul weather, what doth fair betide; What creature's kinde, and what is curst to vs; What plant is holesom, and what venimous. No sooner he his lessons can commence, But Seth hath hit the White of his intents, Draws rule from rule, and of his short collations In a short time a perfect Art he fashions. The more he knowes, the more he craves; as fewell Kils not a fire, but kindles it more cruell. While on a day by a cleer Brook they travell, Seth questions his Father concerning the start of the World fr? the Beginning to the End. Whose gurgling streams frizadoed on the gravell, He thus bespake: If that I did not see The zeal (dear Father) that you bear to me, How still you watch me with your carefull ein, How still your voice with prudent discipline My Prentice ear doth oft reverberate; I should misdoubt to seem importunate; And should content me to haue learned, how The Lord the Heav'ns about this All did bow; What things have hot, and what have cold effect; And how my life and manners to direct. But your milde Love my studious heart advances To ask you further of the various chances Of future times: what off-pring spreading wide Shall fill this World: What shall the World betide; How long to last: What Magistrates, what Kings With Iustice Mace shall govern mortall things? Adams answer.Son (quoth the Sire) our thoughts internall ey Things past and present may by means descry; But not the future, if by speciall grace It read it not in th'One-Trine's glorious face. Thou then, that (onely) things to come dost knowe, Not by Heav'ns course, nor guess of things belowe. Nor coupled points, nor flight of fatall Birds, Nor trembling tripes of sacrificed Heards, But by a clear and certain prescience As Seer and Agent of all accidents, With whom at once the three-fould times do fly, And but a moment lasts Eternity; O God, behould me, that I may behold Thy crystall face: O Sun, reflect thy gold On my pale Moon; that now my veiled eyes, Earth-ward eclipst, may shine vnto the skyes. Ravish me, Lord, ô (my soules life) reviue My spirit a-space, that I may see (alive) Heav'n yer I dy: and make me now (good Lord) The Eccho of thy all-celestiall Word. The power of Gods spirit in his Prophets: and the difference between such, and the distracted frantike Ministers of Satan.With sacred fury suddenly he glowes, Not like the Bedlani Bacchanalian froes, Who, dancing, foaming, rowling furious-wise Vnder their twinkling lids their torch-like eys With ghastly voice, with visage grizly grim; Tost by the Fiend that fiercely tortures them, Bleaking and blushing, panting, shreeking, swouning, With wrathless wounds their senseless members wounding: But as th'Imperiall Airy peoples Prince, With stately pinions soaring-hy from hence, Cleaves through the clouds, and bravely-bold doth think With his firm ey to make the Suns ey wink: So Adam, mounted on the burning wings Of a Seraphick love, leaves earthly things, Feeds on sweet Æther, cleaves the starry Sphears, And on Gods face his eys he fixtly bears: His brows seem brandisht with a Sun-like fire, And his purg'd body seems a cubit higher. Adam declares to his sonne in how many daies the World was created.Then thus began he: Th'ever-trembling field Of scaly folk, the Arches starry seeld, Where th'All-Creator hath disposed well The Sun and Moon by turns for Sentinell; The cleer cloud-bounding Air (the Camp assign'd Where angry Auster, and the rough North-winde, Meeting in battell, throwe down to the soil The Woods that middling stand to part the broil); The Diapry Mansions, where man-kinde doth trade, Were built in Six Daies: and the Seav'nth was made The sacred Sabbath. So, Sea, Earth and Air, And azure-gilded Heav'ns Pavilions fair; Shall stand Six Daies; but longer diversly Then the daies bounded by the Worlds bright ey. The First begins with me: the Seconds morn How many Ages it shall endure. 1. Adam. 2. Noah. 3. Abraham. Is the first Ship-wright, who doth first adorn The Hils with Vines: that Shepheard is the Third, That after God through strange Lands leads his Heard, And (past mans reason) crediting Gods word, His onely Son slaies with a willing sword: The Fourth's another valiant Shepheardling, 4. Dauid. That for a Cannon takes his silly sling, And to a Scepter turns his Shepheards staff, Great Prince, great Prophet, Poet, Psalmograph: The Fift begins from that sad Princes night 5. Zedechias. That sees his children murdred in his sight, And on the banks of fruitfull Euphrates, Poor Iuda led in Captiue heauiness: Hoped Messias shineth in the Sixt; 6. Messias. Who, mockt, beat, banisht, buried, cruci-fixt, For our foul sins (still-selfly innocent) Hath fully born the hatefull punishment: The Last shall be the very Resting-Day, 7. Th'Eternall Sabbath. Th'Air shall be mute, the Waters works shall stay; The Earth her store; the Stars shall leave their measures, The Sun his shine: and in eternall pleasures We plung'd, in Heav'n shall ay solemnize, all, Th'eternall Sabbaths end-less Festiuall. Alas! what may I of that race presume Consideration of Adam vpon that which should befall his Pouerty, vnto the end of the first World destroyed by the Floods according to the relation of Moses in Genesis in the 4. 5. 6 and 7. chapters. Next th'irefull Flame that shall this Frame consume, Whose gut their god, whose lust their law shall be, Who shall not hear of God, nor yet of me? Sith those outrageous, that began their birth On th'holy groundsill of sweet Edens earth, And (yet) the sound of Heav'ns drad Sentence hear, And as ey-witnes of mine Exile were, Seem to despight God. Did it not suffize (O lustfull soule!) first to polygamize? Suffiz'd it not (O Lamech) to distain Thy Nuptiall bed? but that thou must ingrain In thy great-Grand-sires Grand-sires reeking gore Thy cruell blade? respecting nought (before) The prohibition, and the threatning vow Of him to whom infernall Powrs do bow: Neither his Pasports sealed Character Set in the fore-head of the Murderer. Courage, good Enos: re-advance the Standard Of holy Faith, by humane reason slander'd, And troden-down: Invoke th'immortall Powr; Vpon his Altar warm bloud-offrings pour: His sacred nose perfume with pleasing vapor, And teend again Truths neer-extinguisht Taper. Thy pupil Henoch, selfly-dying wholly, (Earths ornament) to God he liveth solely. Lo, how he labours to endure the light Which in th'Arch-essence shineth glorious-bright: How rapt from sense, and free from fleshly lets, Somtimes he climbs the sacred Cabinets Of the divine Ideas everlasting, Having for wings, Faith, fervent Praier and Fasting: How at somtimes, though clad in earthly clod, He (sacred) sees, feels, all enioyes in God: How at somtimes, mounting from form to form, In form of God he happy doth transform. Lo, how th'All-fair, as burning all in love With his rare beauties, not content above T'haue half, but all, and ever; sets the stairs That lead from hence to Heav'n his chosen heirs: Lo, how he climeth the supernall stories. Adieu, dear Henoch: in eternall glories Dwell there with God: thy body, chang'd in quality Of Spirit or Angell, puts-on immortality: Thine eys already (now no longer eyes, But new bright stars) doo brandish in the skyes: Thou drinkest deep of the celestiall wine: Thy Sabbath's end-less: without vail (in fine) Thou seest God face to face; and neer vnite To th'One-Trine Good, thou liv'st in th'Infinite. But heer the while (new Angell) thou dost leaue Fell wicked folk, whose hands are apt to reaue, Whose Scorpion tongues delight in sowing strife, Whose guts are gulfs, incestuous all their life. O strange to be beleev'd! the blessed Race, The sacred Flock, whom God by speciall grace Adopts for his, ev'n they (alas!) most shame-less Do follow sin, most beastly-brute and tame-less, With lustfull eys choosing for wanton Spouses Mens wicked daughters; mingling so the houses Of Seth and Cain; preferring foolishly Frail beauties blaze to vertuous modesty. From these profane, foul, cursed kisses sprung A cruell brood, feeding on blood and wrong; Fell Gyants strange, of haughty hand and minde, Plagues of the World, and scourges of Mankinde. Then, righteous God (though ever prone to pardon) Seeing His mildeness but their malice harden, List plead no longer, but resolves the Fall Of man forth-with, and (for mans sake) of all: Of all (at least) the living creatures gliding Along the air, or on the earth abiding. Heav'ns crystall windows with one hand he opes, Whence on the World a thousand Seas he drops: With th'other hand he gripes and wringeth forth The spungy Globe of th'execrable Earth, So straightly prest, that it doth straight restore All liquid flouds that it had drunk before: In every Rock new Rivers doo begin; And to his aid the snowes com tumbling in: The Pines and Cedars haue but boughs to showe, The shoars doo shrink, the swelling waters growe. Alas! so many Nephews lose I heer Amid these deeps, that but for mountains neer, Vpon the rising of whose ridges lofty, The lusty climb on every side for safety, I should be seed-less: but (alas!) the Water Swallows those Hils, and all this wide Theater Is all one Pond. O children, whither fly-you? Alas! Heav'ns wrath pursues you to destroy-you: The stormy waters strangely rage and roar, Rivers and Seas haue all one common shoar, (To wit) a sable, water-loaden Sky Ready to rain new Oceans instantly. O Son-less Father! O too fruitfull hanches! O wretched root! O hurtfull, hatefull branches! O gulfs vnknown! O dungeons deep and black! O worlds decay! O vniversall wrack! O Heav'ns! O Seas! O Earth (now Earth no more) O flesh! O bloud! Heer, sorrow stopt the door Of his sad voice; and, almost dead for wo, The prophetizing spirit forsook him so. NOAH. THE SECOND DAY OF THE SECOND WEEK. CONTAINING I. The Ark, II. Babylon, III. The Colonies, IV. The Colvmnes. The Ark. THE FIRST PART OF THE SECOND DAY OF THE II. WEEK. The Argvment. Noah prepares the Ark: and thither brings (With him) a Seed-pair of all liuing things: His exercise, a-ship-board: Atheist Cham His holy Fathers humble Zeal doth blame; And diversly impugns Gods Providence: Noah refells his Faith-less arguments: The Flood surceast: Th'Ark landed: Blood forbid: The Rain-bowe bent; what is prefigured: Wine drowneth Wit: Cham scoffs the Nakednes Of's sleeping Sire: the Map of Drunkennes. If now no more my sacred rimes distill A Preamble, wherein by a modest complaint the Poet stirs up the Reader's attention, and makes himself way to the invocation of the Name of God. With Art-less ease from my dis-custom'd quill: If now the Laurell, that but lately shaded My beating temples, be dis-leav'd and vaded: And if now, banisht from the learned Fount, And cast down head-long from the lofty Mount Where sweet Vrania sitteth to endite, Mine humbled Muse flag in a lowely flight; Blame these sad Times ingratefull cruelty, My houshold cares, my healths infirmity, My drooping sorrows for (late) grievous losses, My busie suits, and other bitter crosses. Lo, there the clogs that waigh down heavily My best endevours, whilom soaring high: My harvest's hail: the pricking thorns and weeds That in my soule choak those diviner seeds. O gracious God! remove my great incumbers, Kindle again my faiths neer-dying imbers: Asswage thine anger (for thine own Sons merit) And from me (Lord) take not thy holy Spirit: Comb, gild and polish, more then ever yet, This later issue of my labouring wit: And let not me be like the winde, that proudly Begins at first to roar and murmur loudly Against the next hils, over-turns the woods, With furious tempests tumbles-vp the floods, And (fiercely-fell) with stormy puffs constrains The sparkling flints to roul about the Plains; But flying, faints; and every league it goes, One nimble feather of his wing doth lose: But rather like a River poorly-breeding In barren Rocks, thence drop by drop proceeding: Which, toward the Sea, the more he flees his source, With growing streams strengthens his gliding course, Rowls, roars and foams, raging with rest-less motion, And proudly scorns the greatnes of the Ocean. The comming of the Flood, and building of the Ark. The Dooms of Adam lackt not long effect. Eor th'angry Heav'ns (that can, without respect Of persons, plague the stubborn Reprobate) In Waters buried th'Vniversall state: And never more the nimble painted Legions With hardy wings had cleft the airy Regions: We all had perisht, and the Earth in vain Had brought such store of fruits, and grass, and grain, If Lamech's Son (by new-found Art directed) That huge vast vessell had not first erected, Which (sacred refuge) kept the parent-pairs Of all things moving in the Earth and Airs. Noahs exercises aboord the Ark.Now, while the Worlds-re-colonizing Boat Doth on the waters over Mountains float, Noe passeth not, with tales and idle play, The tedious length of daies and nights away: But, as the Sommers sweet distilling drops Vpon the medowes thirsty yawning chops, Re-greens the Greens, and doth the flow'rs re-flowr, All scorcht and burnt with Auster's parching powr: So, the care-charming hony that distils From his wise lips, his house with comfort fils, Flatters despair, dryes tears, calms inward smarts, And re-advanceth sorrow-daunted harts. Cheer yee, my children: God doth now retire These murdering Seas, which the revenging ire Of his strict Iustice holy indignation Hath brought vpon this wicked generation; Arming a season, to destroy mankinde, The angry Heav'ns, the water, and the winde: As soon again his gracious Mercy will Clear cloudy Heav'ns, calm windes, and waters still, His wrath and mercy follow turn by turn; That (like the Lightning) doth not lightly burn Long in a place: and this from age to age Hides with her wings the faithfull heritage. Our gracious God makes scant-weight of displeasure, And spreads his mercy without weight or measure: Somtimes he strikes vs (to especiall ends) Vpon our selues, our children, or our friends, In soule or body, goods, or else good names, But soon he casts his rods in burning flames: Not with the fist, but finger he doth beat-vs; Nor doth he thrill so oft as he doth threat-vs: And (prudent Steward) gives his faithfull Bees Wine of his Wrath, to rebell Drones the Lees. And thus the deeds of Heav'ns Iust-gentle King, The Second Worlds good Patriarch did sing. But, brutish Cham, hat in his brest accurst Cham full of impiety, is brought in, answering his Father, and diuersly impugning the wisdome and irreprehensible Prouidence of God Almighty and all-mercifull: and the humble and religious zeal of Noah. The secret roots of sinfull Atheisme nurst; Wishing already to dis-throne th'Eternall, And self-vsurp the Maiesty supernall: And to himself, by name of Iupiter, On Afrik funds a sumptuous Temple rear: With bended brows, with stout and stern aspect, In scornfull tearms his Father thus be-checkt: Oh! how is grieues me, that these servile terrors. (The scourge of Cowards, and base vulgars errors) Haue ta'en such deep root in your feeble brest! Why, Father, alwayes selfly thus deprest? Will you thus alwaies make your self a drudge, Fearing the fury of a fained Iudge? And will you alwayes forge your self a Censor That waighs your words, and doth your silence censure? A fly Controuler, that doth count your hairs, That in his hand your hearts keyes ever bears, Records your sighs, and all your thoughts descries, And all your sins present and past espies? A barbarous Butcher, that with bloody knife Threats night and day your grievous-guilty life? O! see you not the superstitious heat Of this blinde zeale, doth in your minde beget A thousand errors? light credulity Doth drive you still to each extreamity, Faining a God (with thousand storms opprest) Fainter then Women, fiercer then a Beast. Who (tender-hearted) weeps at others weeping, Wails others woes, and at the onely peeping Of others blood, in sudden swoun deceases, In manly brest a womans heart possesses: And who (remorse-less) lets at any season The stormy tide of rage transport his reason, And thunders threats of horror and mishap, Hides a Bears heart vnder a humane shape. Yet, of your God, you one-while thus pretend; He melts in tears, if that your fingers end But ake a-while: anon, he frets, he frowns, He burns, he brains, he kiss, he dams, he drowns. The wildest Boar doth but one Wood destroy; A cruell Tyrant but one Land annoy: And yet this Gods outrageous tyranny Spoils all the World, his onely Empery. O goodly Iustice! One or two of vs Have sinn'd perhaps, and mov'd his anger thus; All bear the pain, yea even the innocent Poor Birds and Beasts incurr the punishment. No, Father, no: ('t is folly to infer it) God is no varying, light, inconstant spirit, Full of revenge, and wrath, and moody hate, Nor savage fell, nor sudden passionate, Nor such as will for som small fault vndoo This goodly World, and his own nature too. All wandring clouds, all humid exhalations, All Seas (which Heav'n through many generations Hath hoorded vp) with selfs-waight enter-crusht, Now all at once vpon the earth have rusht: And th'end-less, thin air (which by secret quils Had lost it self within the windes-but hils Dark hollow Caves, and in that gloomy hold To icy crystall turned by the cold) Now swiftly surging towards Heav'n again, Hath not alone drown'd all the lowely Plain, But in few daies with raging Floods o'r-flow'n The top-less Cedars of mount Libanon. Answers of Noah to all the blasphemies of Cham and his fellow-Atheists.Then, with iust grief the godly Father, gall'd, A deep, sad sigh from his hearts centre hal'd, And thus reply'd: O false, rebellious Cham; Mine ages sorrow, and my houses shame; Though self-conceipt contemning th'holy Ghost, Thy sense is baend, thine vnderstanding lost: And ô I fear (Lord, falsifie my fear) The heavy hand of the high Thunderer Shall light on thee, and thou (I doubt) shalt be His Furies obiect, and shalt testifie By thine infamous lifes accursed state, What now thy shame-less lips sophisticate. I (God be prays'd) knowe that the perfect Circle 1 Answer: God is infinite, immutable, Almighty and incomprehensible. Whose Center's every-where, of all his circle Exceeds the circuit; I conceiue aright Th'Almighty-most to be most infinite: That th'onely Essence feels not in his minde The furious tempests of fell passions winde: That mooueless, all he moves: that with one thought He can build Heav'n; and, builded, bring to nought: That his high Throne's inclos'd in glorious Fire Past our approach: that our faint soule doth tire, Our spirit growes spright-less, when it seeks by sense To found his infinit Omni-potence. I surely know the Cherubins do hover With flaming wings his starry face to cover. None sees the Great, th'Almighty, Holy-One, But passing by and by the back alone. To vs, his Essence is in-explicable, Wondrous his wayes, his name vn-vtterable; So that concerning his high Maiesty Our feeble tongues speak but improperly. So that men cannot speak of Him but improperly. For, if we call him strong, the prayse is small: If blessed spirit, so are his Angels all: If Great of greats, he's voide of quantity: If good, fayr, holy, he wants quality; Sith in his Essence fully excellent, All is pure substance, free from accident. Therefore our voice, too-faint in such a subiect Why we cannot speak of God but after the manner of men. T'ensue our soule and our weak soule her obiect, Doth alwayes stammer; so that euer when 'Twould make Gods name redoubted among men (In humane phraze) it calls him pitifull, Repentant, iealous, fierce, and angerfull. Yet is not God by this repentance, thus, 2. Answer. The Repentance and the change which the Scripture attribute is to God, is far fr? Error &amp; defect. Of ignorance and error taxt, like vs: His iealous hatred doth not make him curious, His pitty wretched, nor his anger furious. Th'immortall Spirit is ever calmly-cleer: And all the best that feeble man doth heer, With vehemence of some hot passion driv'n; That, with ripe iudgement doth the King of Heav'n. Shall a Physician comfortably-bold, Two comparisons explaining the same. Fear-less, and tear-less, constantly behold His sickly friend vext with exceeding pain, And feel his pulse, and give him health again? And shall not th'euer-selfe-resembling God Look down from Heav'n vpon a wretched clod, Without he weep, and melt for griefe and anguish; Nor cure his creature, but himselfe must languish? And shall a Iudge, self-angerless, prefer To shamefull death the strange adulterer; As onely looking fixtly all the time Not on the sinner, but the sinfull crime? 3. Answer: Iustice being a vertue in Man cannot be a vice in God.And shall not then th'Eternall Iusticer Condemn the Atheist and the Murderer, Without selfs-fury? O! shall Iustice then Be blam'd in God, and magnifi'd in men? Or shall his sacred Will, and soverain Might Be chayn'd so fast to mans frail appetite, That filthy sin he cannot freely hate, But wrathfull Rage him selfly cruciate? 4. Answer: God doth not punish Offenders for defence of his owne Estate: but to man and vertue &amp; c?found loue.Gods sacred vengeance, serues not for defence Of his own Essence from our violence (For in the Heav'ns, aboue all reach of ours, He dwels immur'd in diamantine Towers); But, to direct our liues and laws maintain, Guard Innocence, and Iniurie restrain. 5. The iniquitie of the world deserued extreame punishment.Th'Almighty past not mean, when-he subuerted Neer all the World from holy paths departed. For Adams Trunk (of both-our Worlds the Tree) In two faire Branches forking fruitfully, Of Cain and Seth; the first brought forth a sute Of bitter, wilde, and most detested fruit: Th'other, first rich in goodnes, afterward With those base Scions beeing graft, was marr'd: And so produced execrable clusters Worthy so wicked and incestuous lusters: And then (alas!) what was ther to be found Pure, iust, or good, in all this Earthly Round? 6. When all are generally depraued, all merite to be destroyed. Cain's Line possest sinne, as an heritage; Seth's as a dowry got by mariage: So that (alas!) among all humane-kinde Those Mongrell kisses marr'd the purest minde. 7. The least imperfect passe condemnation, euen then when they are most liuely chasticed.And we (even we, that haue escaped here This cruell wrack) within our conscience bear A thousand Records of a thousand things Conuincing vs before the King of kings; Whereof not one (for all our self-affection) We can defend with any iust obiection. 8. God destroying the workm?, doth no wrong to the Tools, if, he break, &amp; batter them with their Master.God playd no Tyrant, choaking with the floods The earthly Bands and all the ayrie broods: For, sith they liv'd but for mans seruice sole, Man, raz'd for sin out of the Liuing Roule, Those wondrous tools, and organs excellent, Their Work-man rest, remain'd impertinent. Man's only head of all that draweth breath. Who lacks a member, yet persevereth To liue (we see): but, members cut away From their own head, do by and by decay. Nor was God cruell, when he drown'd the Earth. 9. A Traytor deserues to haue his house razed to the ground. For, sit hence man had from his very birth Rebeld against him; was't not equity, That for his fault, his house should vtterly Be rent and raz'd? that salt should there be sow'n, That in the ruins (for instruction) We for a time might reade and vnderstand The righteous vengeance of Heav'ns wrathfull hand, That wrought this Deluge: and no hoorded waues Of ayry clouds, or vnder-earthly caves? If all blew Curtins mixt of ayr and water, 10. The Flood was no naturall accident, but a most iust iudgement of God. Round over-spreading this wide All-Theater, To som one Climate all at once should fly, One Country they might drown vndoubtedly: But our great Galley hauing gone so far, So many months, in sight of either Star, From Pole to Pole through sundry Climats whorld, Showes that this Flood hath drowned all the world. Now non plust, if to re-inforce thy Camp, 11. The waters of the Flood sprung not from a naturall motion only, but proceeded from other then naturall Causes, which cannot produce such effects. Thou fly for succour to thine Ayery Damp: Showe, in the concave of what Mountains steep We may imagine Dens sufficient deep For so much ayr as gushing out in fountains, Should hide the proud tops of the highest Mountains; Sith a whole tun of ayr scarce yeelds (in triall) Water ynough to fill one little Viall. And what should then betide those empty spaces? What should succeed in the forsaken places Of th'air's thin parts (in swift springs shrinking thence) Sith there's no voyd in th'All-circumference? Whence (wilt thou say) then coms this raging flood, 12. The consideration of the power of God in subiecting the creatures to Noah: in sustaining &amp; feeding them so long in the Ark (which was as a sepulchre) confuteth al the obiections of Atheists. That ouer-flowes the windy Ryphean Wood, Mount Libanus, and enuiously aspires To quench the light of the celestiall fires? Whence (shall I say) then, whence-from coms it (Cham) That Wolues, and Panthers waxing meek and tame, Leaving the horror of their shady home, Adiourn'd by Heav'n, did in my presence com, Who holding subiect vnder my command So many creatures humbled at my hand, Am now restor'd to th'honour and estate Whence Adam fell through sin and Satans hate? Whence doth it com, or by what reason is't, That vnmann'd Haggards to mine empty fist Com without call? Whence coms it, that so little Fresh water, fodder, meal, and other victuall, Should serue so long so many a greedy-gut As in the dark holds of this Ark is shut? That heer the Partridge doth not dread the Hauk? Nor fearfull Hare the spotted Tiger baulk? That all these storms our Vessell haue not broak? That all this while we do not ioyntly choak With noysom breath, and excrementall stink Of such a common and continuall sink? And that our selues, mid all these deaths, are sav'd From these All-Seas, where all the rest are Grav'd? 13. The Arke full of Miracles, which confound the wits, &amp; slop the mouthes of profane wranglers.In all the compass of our floating Inns, Are not so many planks, and boords, and pins, As wonders strange, and miracles that ground Mans wrangling Reason, and his wits confound: And God, no less his mighty powr displayd When he restor'd, then when the World he made. O sacred Patron! pacific thine ire, Bring home our Hulk: these angry floods retire; A-liue and dead, let vs perceiue and proove Thy wrath on others, on our selues thy love. Thus Noah sweetens his Captivity, Beguiles the time, and charms his misery, God causeth the Flood to cease.Hoping in God alone: who, in the Mountains Now stopping close the veins of all the Fountains, Shutting Heav'ns fluces, causing th'ayr (controul'd) Close-vp his channels, and his Seas with-hould, Cals forth the windes. O Heav'ns fresh fans (quoth he) Earths sweeping Brooms, O Forrests enmity, O you my Heralds and my Harbengers My nimble Postes and speedy Messengers, Mine arms, my sinews, and mine Eagles swift That through the ayr my rowling Chariot lift, When from my mouth in my iust-kindled ire Fly Sulph'ry fumes, and hot consuming fire, When with my Lightning Scepters dreadfull wonder I muster horror, darknes, clouds and thunder: Wake, rise, and run, and drink these waters dry, That hills and dales haue hidden from the sky. The Arke resteth on the Mountain Ararat, in Armenia.Th'Æolian Crowd obays his mighty call, The surly surges of the waters fall, The Sea retreateth: and the sacred Keel Lands on a Hill, at whose proud feet do kneel A thousand Hils, his lofty horn adoring That cleaues the clouds, the starry welking goaring. What Noah did before he went forth.Then hope-cheer'd Noah, first of all (for scout) Sends forth the Crowe, who flutters neer-about; And finding yet no landing place at all, Returns a-boord to his great Admirall. Som few daies after from the window flyes The harm-less Doue for new discoueries: But seeing yet no shoar, she (almost tyr'd) Aboord the Carrack back again retir'd. But yet the Sun had seav'n Heav'n-Circuits rode, To view the World a-fresh she flyes abroad; And brings a-boord (at evening) in her bill An Oliue branch with water pearled still. O happy presage! O deer pledge of loue! O wel-com newes! behold the peacefull Doue Brings in her beak the Peace-branch, boading weal And truce with God; who by this sacred seal Kindly confirms his holy Couenant, That first in fight the Tiger rage shall want, Lions be cowards, Hares couragious, Yer he be false in word or deed to vs. O sacred Oliue! firstling of the fruits, Health-boading branch, be it thy tender roots Haue lived still, while this strange Deluge lasted, I doe reioice it hath not all things wasted: Or be it since the Ebb, thou newly spring, Prays'd be the bounty of th'immortall King That quickens thus these dead, the World induing With beauty fresh so suddainly renuing. Thus Noah spake: And though the World gan lift He exspecteth Gods commandement to goe forth whereby, at the first hee was shut vpon the Ark. Most of his Iles above the waters drift: Though waxen old in his long weary night, He see a friendly Sun to brandish bright: Though choak't with ill ayr in his stinking stall, Hee'l not a-shoar till God be pleas'd with-all; And till (deuout) from Heav'n he vnderstand Som Oracle to licence him to land. But, warn'd by Heav'n, he commeth from his Cave, (Or rather from a foul infectious Grave) With Sem, Cam, Iapheth, and their twice-two Brides, And thousand pairs of liuing things besides, Vnclean and clean: for th'holy Patriark Had of all kinds inclosed in the Ark. But, heer I hear th'vngodly (that for fear Late whispered softly in each others ear, With silent murmurs muttering secretly) Now trumpet thus their filthy blasphemie; Who will beleeve (but shallow-brained Sheep) New obiection of Atheists, concerning the capacity of the Ark. That such a ship scarce thirty Cubits deep, Thrice fifty long, and but once fifty large, So many months could bear so great a charge? Sith the proud Horse, the rough-skinn'd Elephant, The lusty Bull, the Camell water-want, And the Rhinocerot, would, with their fodder, Fill-vp a Hulk farr deeper, longer, broader? Answer.O profane mockers! if I but exclude Out of this Vessell a vast multitude Of since-born mongrels, that deriue their birth From monstrous medly of Venerean mirth; Fantastik Mules, and spotted Leopards, Of incest-heat ingendred afterwards: So many sorts of Dogs, of Cocks and Doves, Since, dayly sprung from strange and mingled loues Wherein from time to time in various sort, Dedalian Nature seems her to disport: If playner, yet I proue you space by space, And foot by foot, that all this ample place, By subtile iudgement made and Symmetrie, Might lodge so many creatures handsomly, Sith euery brace was Geometricall: Nought resteth (Momes) for your reply at all; If, who dispute with God, may be content To take for current, Reasons argument. An vn-answerable answer to all profane obiections.But heer t'admire th'Almighties powerfull hand I rather loue, and silence to command To mans discourse: what he hath said, is don: For, euermore his word and deed are one. By his sole arm, the Gallions Masters saw Themselues safe rescu'd from deaths yawning iaw; And offers-vp to him in zealous wise, The Peace-full sent of sweet burnt-sacrifice; And sends withall above the starry Pole These winged sighes from a religious soule; World-shaking Father, Windes King, calming-Seas, With milde aspect behold vs; Lord appease Thine Angers tempest, and to safety bring The planks escap't from this sad Perishing: And bound for ever in their antient Caves These stormy Seas deep World-deuouring waves. Comandements, Prohibitions, &amp; Promises of God to Noah &amp; his Posteritie.Increase (quoth God) and quickly multiply, And fill the World with fruitfull Progeny: Resume your Scepter, and with new beheasts Bridle againe the late revolted Beasts, Re-exercise your wonted rule again, It is your office ouer them to raigne: Deere Children, vse them all: take, kill, and eate: But yet abstain, and do not take for meat Their ruddy soule: and leaue (O sacred seed!) To rav'ning Fowls, of strangled flesh to feed. I, I am holy: be you holy then, I deeply hate all cruell bloody men: Therefore defile not in your brothers blood Your guilty hands; refraine from cruell mood; Fly homicide: doe not in any case, In man, mine Image brutishly deface: The cruell man a cruell death shall taste; And blood with blood be venged first or last; For euermore vpon the murderers head My roaring storms of fury shall be shed. From hence-forth, fear no second Flood that shall The Rain-Bowe giu? for a Pledge of the Promise, that there shal be no more generall flood. Cover the whole face of this earthly Ball: I assure ye no; no, no, I sweare to you (And who hath ever found mine Oath vntrue?) Again, I swear by my thrice sacred Name: And to confirm it, in the Clouds I frame This coloured Bowe. When then som tempest black Shall threat again the feareful World to wrack, When water loaden Heav'ns your Hils shall touch, When th'ayr with Midnight shall your Noon be-pitch, Your cheerfull looks vp to this Rain-bowe cast. For, though the same on moystfull Clouds be plaç't, Though hemm'd with showrs and though it seem to sup (To drown the World) all th'Oceans waters vp, Yet shall it (when you seem in danger sink) Make you, of me; me, of my promise, think. Noah looks-vp, and in the Ayr he views Description of the Rain-Bowe. A semi-Circle of a hundred hews: Which, bright ascending toward th'æthereall thrones, Hath a lyne drawn between two Orizons For iust Diameter: an even-bent bowe Contriv'd of three; whereof the one doth showe To be all painted of a golden hew, The second green, the third an orient blew; Yet so, that in this pure blew-golden-green Still (Opal-like) som changeable is seen. A Bowe bright-shining in th'Arch-Archers hand, Whose subtill string seems level with the Land, Half-parting Heav'n; and over vs it bends, Within two Seas wetting his horned ends; A temporall beauty of the lampfull skies, Where powrfull Nature shewes her freshest Dies. And if you onely blew and red perceive, The same as signes of Sea, and Fire conceiue; What it signifieth. Of both the flowing and the flaming Doom, The Iudgement past, and Iudgement yet to come. Then, having call'd on God, our second Father Suffers not sloth his arms together gather, Noah falls to Husbandry, andtills the Earth, as he had done before the Flood. But fals to work, and wisely now renew'th The Trade he learn'd to practice in his youth. For, the proud issue of that Tyrant rude That first his hand in brothers bloud imbrewd, As scorning Ploughs, and hating harm-less tillage, And (wantons) prising less the homely village, With fields and Woods, then th'idle Cities shades; Imbraced Laws, Scepters, and Arts, and Trades. But Seths Sons, knowing Nature soberly Content with little, fell to Husbandry, Thereto reducing, with industrious care, The Flocks and Droves cover'd with wool and hair; As prayse-full gain, and profit void of strife, Art nurse of Arts, and very life of life. So the bright honour of the Heav'nly Tapers Had scarcely boxed all th'Earths dropsie vapours, When hee that sav'd the store-seed-World from wrack, Began to delve his fruitfull Mothers back, And there soon-after planteth heedfully The brittle branches of the Nectar-tree. He plants a vine.For, 'mong the pebbles of a pretty hill To the warm Sunsey lying open still, He sets in furrows or in shallow trenches The crooked Vines choice scyons, shoots, and branches: In March he delves them, re-re-delves, and dresses: Cuts, props and proins; and God his work so blesses, That in the third September for his meed The plentious Vintage doth his hopes exceed. He is ouer-taken with Wine.Then Noah, willing to beguile the rage Of bitter griefs that vext his feeble age, To see with mud so many Roofs o're-growen, And him left almost in the World alone; One-day a little from his strictness shrunk, And making merry, drinking, over-drunk: And, silly, thinking in that hony-gall To drown his woes, he drowns his wits and all. Description of a drunken-man.His head growes giddy, and his foot indents, A mighty fume his troubled brain torments, His idle prattle from the purpose quite, Is abrupt, stuttering, all confus'd, and light: His wine-stuft stomack wrung with winde he feels: His trembling Tent all topsie turuie wheels: At last, not able on his legs to stand, More like a foul Swine then a sober man, Opprest with sleep, he wallows on the ground His shame-less snorting trunk, so deeply drownd In self-obliuion, that he did not hide Those parts that Cæsar covered when he died. Ev'n as the Ravens with windy wings o'r-fly Fit Comparisons to set forth the nature and property of Slanderers, &amp; Detracters imitating Cham. The weeping Woods of Happy Araby, Despise sweet Gardens and delicious Bowrs Perfuming Heav'n with odoriferous flowres, And greedy, light vpon the loathsom quarters Of som late Lopez, or such Romish Martyrs: Or as a young, vnskilfull Painter raw, Doth carelesly the fairest features draw In any face, and yet too neerly marks Th'vnpleasing blemish of deformed marks, As lips too great, or hollowness of eys, Or sinking nose, or such indecencies: Even so th'vngodly Sonns of Leasings Father With black Obliuions sponge ingrately smother Fair Vertues draughts, and cast despightfully On the least sinns the venom of the ey, Frump others faults, and trumpet in all ages The lightest trips of greatest Personages: Like scoffing Cham that impudently viewd His Fathers shame, and most profanely-lewd, With scornfull laughter (grace-less) thus began To infamize the poor old drunken man, Com (brethren) com, com quickly and behould This pure controuler that so oft contrould His speech to his Brethren, seeing his fathers nakednes. Vs without cause: see how his bed he soyls: See, how the wine (his master) now recoyls By's mouth, and eys, and nose: and brutely so To all that com his naked shame doth showe. Ah shame-less beast (both brethren him reproov'd, Both chiding thus, both with iust anger moou'd) Vnnaturall villain, monster pestilent, Vnworthy to behould the firmament; Their discreet behauiour. Where (absent we) thou ought'st haue hid before With thine owne Cloak, but with thy silence more, Thy Fathers shame, whom age, strong wine, and grief, Haue made to fall, but once in all his life; Thou barkest first, and sporting at the matter Proclaim'st his fault on Infamies Theater. And saying this (turning their sight a-side) Their hoary Fathers nakedness they hide. When wine had wrought, this good old-man awook, Noah awaked curseth Cham &amp; his posterity: &amp; blesseth Sem and Iaphet and their issue. Agniz'd his crime, ashamed, wonder-strook At strength of wine, and toucht with true repentance, With Prophet-mouth gan thus his Sons fore-sentence: Curst be thou Cham, and curst be (for thy scorn) Thy darling Canaan: let the pearly Morn, The radiant Noon, and rheumy Euening see Thy necke still yoaked with Captiuity. God be with Sem: and let his gracious speed Spread-wide my Iapheths fruitfull-swarming seed. An execration of Drunkennes, described with its shamefull, dangerous and detestable effects.Error, no error, but a wilfull badnes: O soul defect! O short, O dangerous madnes! That in thy rage, dost harm-less Clytus smother, By his deer friend; Pentheus by his Mother. Phrenzie, that makes the vaunter insolent; The talk-full, blab; cruell, the violent: The fornicator, wax adulterous; Th'adulterer, becom incestuous: With thy plagues leauen swelling all our crimes; Blinde, shameless, sense-less, quenching of entimes The soule within itself: and oft defames The holiest men with execrable blames. And as he Must, beginning to re-boyl, Makes his new vessels wooden bands re-coyl, Lifts-vp his lees, and spews with fuming vent From his Tubs ground his scummy excrement: So ruin'st thou thine hoast, and foolishly From his harts bottom driv'st all secrecy. But, hadst thou neuer don (O filthy poison!) More mischief heer, but thus bereft of reason This Vertues Module (rather Vertues best) We ought thee more then Death it self detest. FINIS. Babylon. THE SECOND PART OF THE SECOND DAY OF THE II. WEEK. The Argvment. Th'Antithesis of Blest and Cursed States, Subiect to Good and Euill Magistrates: Nimrod vsurps: His prowes-full Policy, To gain himself the Goal of Souerainty: Babel begun: To stop such out-rages, There, God confounds the, builders Languages: Tongues excellent: the Hebrew, first and Best: Then Greek and Latin: and (aboue the rest) Th'Arabian, Toscan, Spanish, French, and Dutch, And Ours, are Honoured by our Author much. O happy people, where good Princes raign, A preface, representing the felicity &amp; happy estate of Common weales gouerned by good and prudent princes &amp; the misery of those that liue in subiection vnto Tyrants: which the Poet very fitly proposeth as his introduction to the life and Manners of Nimrod. Who tender publike more then priuate gain! Who (vertue's patrons, and the plagues of vice) Hate Parasites, and harken to the wise: Who (self-commanders) rather sin suppress By self-examples, then by rigorousnes: Whose inward-humble, outward Maiesty With Subiects loue is guarded loyally: Who Idol-not their pearly Scepters glory, But knowe themselues set on a lofty story For all the world to see and censure too: So, not their lust, but what is iust they do. But, 't is a hell, in hatefull vassallage, Vnder a Tyrant to consume ones age: A self-shav'n Dennis, or a Nero fell, Whose cursed Courts with bloud and incest swell: An Owl, that flies the light of Parliaments And State-assemblies iealous of th'intents Of priuate tongues; who (for a pastime) sets His Peers at ods; and on their fury whets: Who neither faith, honour, nor right respects: Who euery day new Officers erects: Who brooks no learned, wise, nor valiant subiects, But daily crops such vice-vpbraiding obiects, Who (worse then Beasts, or savage monsters been). Spares neither mother, brother, kiff, nor kin: Who, though round fenç't with guard of armed Knights, A-many moe he fears, then he affrights: Who taxes strange extorts; and (Caniball) Gnawes to the bones his wretched Subiects all. A Prayer fitted to the former discourse, and giving entry to that which followeth.Print (O Heav'ns King!) in our kings harts a zeal, First of thy lawes; then of their publik weal: And if our Countries now-Po-poisoned phrase; Or now-contagion of corrupted daies Leave any tract of Nimrodizing there; O! cancel it that they may euery where, In stead of Babel build Ierusalem: That lowd my Muse may eccho vnder them. Nimrod's exercises and essayes to make himselfe Master of the rest. Yer Nimrod had attain'd to twise six yeers, He tyranniz'd among his stripling-peers, Out stript his equals, and in happy howr, Layd the foundations of his after-powr; And bearing reeds for Scepters, first he raigns In Prentice-Princedom ouer sheep-heard Swains. Then knowing well, that whoso ayms (illuster) At fancied bliss of Empires awful lustre; In valiant acts must pass the vulgar sort, Or mask (at least) in louely Vertues Port: He spends not night on beds of down or feathers, Nor day intents, but hardens to all weathers His youthfull limbs: and takes ambitiously A rock for Pillow, Heav'n for Canapey: In stead of softlings iests, and iollities, He ioyes in Iousts, and manly exercises: His dainty cates, a fat Kids trembling flesh, Scarce fully slain, luke-warm and bleeding fresh. Perseverance in painfull and laborious exercises of Nimrod growne gracious with the people.Then, with one breath, he striueth to attain A Mountains top, that ouer-peers the Plain: Against the stream to cleave the rowling ridges Of Nymph-strong floods, that haue born down their bridges, Running vnrean'd with swift rebounding sallies A-cross the rocks within the narrow vallies: To ouertake the dart himselfe did throwe, And in plain course to catch the Hinde or Roe. But, when fiue lustres of his age expir'd, Feeling his stomach and his strength aspir'd To worthier wars, perceiv'd he any-where, Boar, Libbard, Lyon, Tiger, Ounse, or Bear, Him dread-less combats; and in combat foyls, And rears high Tropheis of his bloody spoyls. The people, seeing by his war-like deed From theeues, and robbers every passage freed: From hideous yels, the Desarts round about: From fear, their flocks; this monster-master stout, This Hercules, this hammer-ill, they tender, And call him (all) their Father and Defender. Then Nimrod (snatching Fortune by the tresses) He abandons his first petty Chase, and hunteth wilier for a more pretious Prey. Strikes the hot steel; sues, sooths, importunes, presses Now these, then those, and (hastning his good Hap) Leaues hunting Beasts, and hunteth Men to trap. For, like as He, in former quests did vse Cals, pit-fals, toyls, sprenges, and baits, and glews: And (in the end) against the wilder game, Clubs, darts, and shafts, and swords, their rage to tame: So, som he wins with promise-full intreats, With presents som, and som with rougher threats: And boldly (breaking bounds of equity) Vsurps the Child-World's maiden Monarchy; Whereas, before each kindred had for guide Their proper Chief, yet that the youthfull pride Of vpstart State, ambitious, boyling fickle, Did thrust (as now) in others corn his sickle. In-throniz'd thus, this Tyrant gan deuise Tyrannicall rule of Nimrod, and his proud enterprize. To perpetrate a thousand cruelties, Pel-mel subverting for his appetite God's, Man's, and Natures triple sacred Right. He braves th'Almighty, lifting to his nose His flowring Scepter: and for fear he lose The peoples aw; who (idle) in the end Might slip their yoak; he subtle makes them spend, Draws dry their wealth, and busies them to build A lofty Towr, or rather Atlas wilde. W' have liv'd (quoth he) too-long like pilgrim Grooms: Leave we these rowling tents, and wandring rooms: Let's raise a Palace, whose proud front and feet With Heav'n and Hell may in an instant meet; A sure Asylum, and a safe retrait, If th'irefull storm of yet-more Floods should threat: Lets found a Citie, and vnited there, Vnder a King let's lead our liues; for fear Lest sever'd thus, in Princes and in Tents, We be disperst o'r all the Regiments That in his course the Dayes bright Champion eyes. Might-less our selues to succour, or aduise. But, if the fire of som intestine war, Or other mischief should diuide vs far, Brethren (at least) let's leaue memorialls Of our great names on these cloud-neighbouring wals. A comparison, shewing liuely the efficacy of the attempts of Tyrants, the Rods of Gods righteous vengeance vpon vngodly people.Now, as a spark, that Shepheards (vnespied) Haue faln by chance vpon a forrest side, Among dry leaues; a-while in secret shrowds, Lifting a-loft small, smoaky-wauing clowds, Till fanned by the fawning windes, it blushes, With angry rage; and rising through the bushes, Climbs fragrant Hauthorns, thence the Oak, and than The Pine, and Firre, that bridge the Ocean: It still gets ground, and (running) doth augment, And never leaues till all neer Woods be brent: So, this sweet speech (first broacht by certain Minions) Is soon applauded 'mong the light opinions: And by degrees from hand to hand renu'd, To all the base confused multitude; Who longing now to see this Castle rear'd, Them night and day, in differing crafts bestirr'd, Som fall to felling with a thousand stroaks Aduenturous Alders, Ashes, long-liv'd Oaks; Degrading Forrests, that the Sun might view Fields that before his bright rayes never knew. Liuely Description of the people occupied in som great business.Ha 'ye seen a Town expos'd to spoyl and slaughter (At victors pleasure) where laments and laughter Mixtly resound; som carry, som conuay, Som lug, som load; 'gainst Souldiers seeking Prey No place is sure, and yer a day be done, Out at her gate the ransack't Town doth run: So (in a trice) these Carpenters disrobe Th'Assyrian hils of all their leafie robe, Strip the steep Mountains of their gastly shades, And powle the broad Plains, of their branchy glades: Carts, Sleds, and Mules, thick iustling meet abroad, And bending axles groan beneath their load. Heer, for hard Cement, heap they night and day The gummy slime of chalkie waters gray: There, busie Kil-men ply their occupations For brick and tyle: there for their firm foundations, They dig to hell; and damned Ghosts again (Past hope) behold the Suns bright glorious wain: Their hammers noyse, through Heav'ns rebounding brim, Affrights the fish that in fair Tigris swim. These ruddy wals in height, and compasse growe; They cast long shadow, and far-off do showe: All swarms with work-men, that (poor sots) surmise Even the first day to touch the very skies. Which, God perceiving, bending wrathfull frowns, God displeased with the audatious enterprise of Nimrod, and his, resolueth to break their Designes by confounding their Language. And with a noyse that roaring thunder drowns; 'Mid clowdy fields, hils by the roots he rakes, And th'vnmov'd hinges of the Heav'ns he shakes. See, see (quoth he) these dust-spawn, feeble, Dwarfs, See their huge Castles, Wals, and Counter-scarfs: O strength-full Peece, impregnable! and sure All my iust anger's batteries to endure. I swore to them, the fruitfull earth, no more Hence-forth should fear the raging Oceans roar; Yet build they Towrs: I will'd that scattered wide They should go man the World; and lo they bide Self-prisoned heer: I meant to be their Master, My self alone, their Law, their Prince, and Pastor; And they, for Lord, a Tyrant fell haue ta'en-them; Who (to their cost) will roughly curb and rean them; Who scorns mine arm, and with these braving Towrs Attempts to scale this Crystall Throne of Ours. Com, com, let's dash their drift; and sith, combin'd As well in voyce, as blood, and law, and minde, In ill they harden, and with language bold Incourage-on themselues their work to hold, Let's cast let 'gainst their quick diligence: Let's strike them straight with spirit of difference; Let's all confound their speech: let's make the brother, The Sire, and Son, not vnderstand each other. This said, as soon confusedly did bound Execution of Gods decree. Through all the work I wot not what strange sound, A iangling noyse; not much vnlike the rumors Of Bacchus Swains amid their drunken humors: Som speak between the teeth, som in the nose, Som in the throat their words do ill dispose, Som howl, som halloo, som do stut and strain, Each hath his gibberish, and all striue in vain To finde again their know'n beloved tongue, That with their milke they suckt in cradle, young. Arise betimes, while th'Opal-coloured Morn, A fit c?parison. In golden pomp doth May-dayes door adorn: And patient hear th'all-differing voyces sweet Of painted Singers, that in Groues do greet Their Loue-Bon-iours, each in his phrase and fashion From trembling Pearch vttering his earnest passion; And so thou mayst conceipt what mingle-mangle Among this people every where did iangle. Bring me (quoth one) a trowell, quickly, quick; One brings him vp a hammer: hew this brick (Another bids) and then they cleaue a Tree: Make fast this rope, and then they let it flee: One cals for planks, another mortar lacks: They bear the first, a stone; the last an ax: One would haue spikes, and him a spade they giue: Another asks a saw, and gets a siue: Thus crosly-crost, they prate and point in vain; What one hath made, another mars again: Nigh breath-less all, with their confused yawling, In boot-less labour, now begins appawling. Another elegant comparison shewing that there is no co?sell, no Endeuor, no diligence, no might nor multitude, that can resist God.In brief, as those, that in som chanell deep Begin to build a Bridge with Arches steep, Perceiving once (in thousand streams extending) The course-chang'd River from the hils descending, With watry Mountains bearing down their Bay, As if it scorn'd such bondage to obay; Abandon quickly all their work begun, And heer and there for swifter safety run: These Masons so, seeing the storm arriv'd Of Gods iust Wrath, all weak, and hart-depriv'd, Forsake their purpose, and like frantick fools Scatter their stuffe, and tumble down their tools. Discommodities proceeding from the confusion of Tongues.O proud revolt! O traiterous felony! See in what sort the Lord hath punisht thee By this Confusion: Ah! that language sweet, Sure bond of Cities, friendships mastick meet, Strong curb of anger yerst vnited, now In thousand dry Brooks strays, I wot not how: That rare-rich gold, that charm-grief fancy-mover, That calm-rage harts-theef, quel-pride conjure-lover: That purest coyn, then current in each coast, Now mingled, hath sound, waight, and colour lost, 'Tis counterfeit: and over every shoar The confus'd fall of Babel yet doth roar. Then, Finland-folk might visit Affrica, The Spaniard Inde, and ours America, Without a truch-man: now, the banks that bound Our Towns about, our tongues do also mound: For, who from home but half a furlong goes, As dumb (alas!) his Reason's tool doth lose: Or if we talk but with our neer confines, We borrow mouthes, or else we work by signes. Vn-toyld, vn-tutord, sucking tender food, We learn'd a language all men vnderstood; And (seav'n-years old) in glass-dust did commence To draw the round Earths fair circumference: To cipher well, and climbing Art by Art, We reacht betimes that Castles highest part, Where th'Encyclopedie her darling Crowns, In signe of conquest, with etern renowns. Now (ever-boys) we wax old while we seek The Hebrew tongue, the Latin, and the Greek: We can but babble, and for knowledge whole Of Natures secrets, and of th'Essence sole Which Essence giues to all, we tire our minde To vary Verbs, and finest words to finde; Our letters and our syllables to waigh: At Tutors lips we hang with heads all gray, Who teach vs yet to read, and giue vs (raw) An A. B. C. for great Iustinians law, Hippocrates, or that Diviner lore, Where God appears to whom him right adore. What shall I more say? Then, all spake the speech The Hebrew Tongue in all Mens mouthes before the confusion of Languages. Of God himself, th'old sacred Idiom rich, Rich perfect language, where's no point, nor signe, But hides som rare deep mystery divine: But since that pride, each people hath a-part A bastard gibberish, harsh, and overthwart; Which daily chang'd, and losing light, wel-neer Nothing retains of that first language cleer. The Phrygians once, and that renowned Nation A conclusion tried, whereby appeareth that children are naturally apt to learn to speak: not able of th?selues to speak, without example. Fed with fair Nilus fruitfull inundation, Longing to know their Languages priority, Fondly impos'd the censuring authority To silly Iudges, voyd of iudging sense (Dumb stammerers to treat of Eloquence) To wit, two Infants nurst by Mothers dumb, In silent Cels, where never noyse should com Of charming humane voyce, to eccho there, Till triple-twelue months full expired were. Then brought before the Memphians, and the men That dwell at Zant, the faint-breath'd childeren, Cry often Bek; Bek, Bek is all the words That their tongue forms, or their dumb mouth affords. Then Phrygians, knowing, that in Phrygian Bek meaneth bread, much to reioyce began, Glad that kinde Nature had now grac't them so, To grant this Sentence on their side to go. Fools, which perceiv'd not, that the bleating flocks Which powl'd the neighbour Mountains motly locks Had taught this tearm, and that no tearms of Rome, Greece, Ægypt, England, France, Troy, Iewry, come Com born with vs: but every Countries tongue Is learnt by much vse, and frequenting long. Only, we haue peculiar to our race, Aptness to speak; as that same other grace Which, richly-divers, makes vs differ more From dull, dumb wretches that in Desarts roar. Answer to the obiection taken from the c?fused voice of Beasts.Now, that Buls bellow (if that any say) That Lions roar, and slothfull Asses bray, Now lowe, now lowd; and by such languages Distinctly seem to shew their courages: Those are not words, but bare expressions Of violent fits of certain passions: Confused signes of sorrw, or annoy, Of hunger, thirst, of anger, loue, or ioy. To another Obiection, of the chirping of Birds.And so I say of all the winged quiers, Which mornly warble, on green trembling briers, Ear-tickling tunes: for, though they seem to prattle A part by payrs, and three to three to tattle; To winde their voyce a hundred thousand wayes, In curious descant of a thousand layes: T'haue taught Apollo, in their School, his skill; Their sounds want sense; their notes are word-less still: Their song, repeated thousand times a-day, As dumb discourse, flies in the Woods away. Aduantage of Man endued with Reason aboue the rest of the Creatures.But, only Man can talke of his Creator, Of Heav'n, and earth, and fire, and ayr, and water, Of Iustice, Temperance, Wisdom, Fortitude, In choise sweet tearms, that various sense include. And not in one sole tongue his thoughts dissunder; Iosephus Scaliger, skilfull in 13. languages.But like to Scaliger, our ages wonder, The Learned's Sun: who eloquently can, Speak Spanish, French, Italian, Nubian, Dutch, Chaldee, Syriak, English, Arabik, (Besides) the Persian, Hebrew, Latin, Greek. O rich quick spirit! O wits Chameleon! Which any Authors colour can put on: Great Iulius Son, and Syluius worthy brother, Th'immortall grace of Gascony, their mother. Answere to a third obiection touching Parot-resembling Eccho, &amp; speaking without speech.And, as for Iayes, that in their wyery gail Can ask for victuals, and vnvictual'd rail; Who, daring vs for eloquences meed, Can plain pronounce the holy Christian Creed, Say the Lords Prayer, and oft repeat it all, And name by name a good great houshold call: Th'are like that voice, which (by our voyce begot) From hollow vale babbles it wots not what: In vain the ayr they beat, it vainly cleaving, And dumbly speak, their owne speech not conceiving, Deaf to themselues: for, speech is nothing (sure) But th'vnseen soules resounding portrature: And chiefly when 'tis short, sweet, painted-plain, As it was all, yer that rough hunters raign. Now, when I note, how th'Hebrew brevity, The Hebrew tongue the principall. Even with few words expresseth happily Deepest conceits; and leads the hearing part Through all the closets of the mazy hart: Better then Greek with her Synonimaes, First reason. Fit Epithets, and fine Metaphoraes, Her apt Coniunctions, Tenses, Moods, and Cases, And many other much esteemed graces: When I remember, how the Rabbins fet Second reason. Out of the sacred Hebrew Alphabet All that our faith beleeues, or eyes behold; That in the Law the Arts are all inrold: Whether (with curious pain) we do transport Her letters turn'd in many-various sort (For, as in ciphering, th'onely transportation Simile. Of figures, still varies their valuation: So th'Anagram strengthens or slacks a name, Giuing a secret twist vnto the same:) Or whether we (euen as in gross) bestowing The numbers, which, from one words letters flowing, Vnfold a secret; and that word again Another of like number doth contain: Whether one letter for a word be put; Or all a sentence in one word be shut: As Ægypts silence sealed-vp (mysterious) In one Character a long sentence serious. When I obserue, that from the Indian Dawning, Third reason. Even to our Irish Etna's fiery yawning: And from hot Tambut, to the Sea Tartarian, Thou seest (O Sun!) no Nation so barbarian, Nor ignorant in all the Laws divine, But yet retains som tearms of Palestine, Whose Elements (how-so disguiz'd) draw-nigh The sacred names of th'old Orthography. When I consider that Gods antient Will Fourth reason. Was first enrowled by an Hebrew quill: That never Vrim, Dream, or Vision sung Their Oracles, but all in Isaaks tongue: That in the same, the Lord himselfe did draw Vpon two Tables his eternall Law: And that (long since) in Sions Languages, His Heav'nly Postes brought down his messages: And (to conclude) when I conceiue, how then Fift reason. They gaue not idle, casuall names to men, But such as (rich in sense) before th'event, Markt in their liues som speciall accident; And yet, we see that all those words of old Of Hebrew still the sound and sense do hold. For, Adam (meaneth) made of clay: his wife Eua (translated) signifieth life: Cain, first begot, Abel, as vain: and Seth, Put in his place: and he that, vnderneath The generall Deluge, saw the World distrest, In true interpretation, soundeth Rest. To th'Hebrew Tongue (how-ever Greece do grudge) The sacred right of Eldership I iudge. Praise of the Hebrew Tongue, Mother and Queen of all the Rest.All hail, therefore, O sempiternall spring Of spirituall pictures! speech of Heav'ns high King, Mother, and Mistress, of all Tongues the Prime: Which (pure) hast past such vast deep gulfs of Time: Which hast no word but weighs, whose Elements Flowe with hid sense, thy points with Sacraments. O sacred Dialect! in thee the names Of Men, Towns, Countries register their fames In brief abridgements: and the names of Birds, Of Water-guests, and Forrest-hanting Heards, Are open Books where every man might read Their natures story; till th'Heav'n-shaker dread, In his iust wrath, the flaming sword had set, The passage into Paradise to let. Adam gaue Hebrew names to all the Creatures.For, Adam then (in signe of mastry) giving Peculiar names vnto all creatures living, When in a generall muster ranged right, They marcht by couples in his awfull sight, He framed them so fit, that learned ears Bearing the soul the sound, the maruails bears, Wherewith th'All-forming voyce adorned fair Th'inhabitants of Sea, and Earth, and Ayr. He inriched the Language with the composition of Verbs and Clauses.And, for each body acts, or suffers ought, Having made Nowns, his Verbs he also wrought: And then, the more t'inrich his speech, he brings Small particles, which stand in lieu of strings, The master members fitly to combine (As two great boards, a little glew doth ioyn) And serue as plumes, which ever dancing light Deck the proud crests of helmets burnisht bright: Frenges to mantles; ears, and rings to vessels: To marble statues, bases, feet, and tressels. The Hebrew Tongue c?tinued from Adam to the time of Nimrod: Since when it rested in the house of Heber, of whom it is called Hebrew.This (Adams language) pure persisted since, Till th'iron Age of that cloud-climbing Prince; Resounding onely, through all mortall tents, The peer-less accents of rich eloquence; But then (as partiall) it it self retyr'd To Hebers house: whether, of the conspir'd Rebels, he were not; but in sober quiet, Dwelt far from Shinar, and their furious ryot: Or whether, thither by compulsion brought, With secret sighes hee oft his God besought, So with vnwilling hands helping to make The wals he wisht deep sunk in Stygian Lake: As wretched Galley-slaues (beating the Seas. Simile. With forced oars, fighting against their ease And liberty) curse in their grieved spright, Those, for whose sake they labour day and night; Or whether else Gods liberall hand, for ever (As it were) meeting holy mens indevour, For his owne sake, of his free grace and pleasure, To th'Hebrew race deposited this treasure; While the proud remnant of those scattered Masons Had falsed it in hundred thousand fashions, When every one where fate him called flew, Bearing new words into his Countrey new. But slipp'ry Time, enviously wasting all, A sub-diuision of the L?guages first diuided. Disfigur'd soon those Tongues authenticall, Which 'mid the Babel-builders thunder, bred On Tigris banks, o're all the earth were spred: And, ay the world the more confus'd to leaue, The least of them in many Tongues did cleaue. Each language alters, either by occasion Whereof proceed the sundry changes in one self same Language. Of trade, which (causing mutuall commutation Of th'Earths and Oceans wares) with hardy luck Doth words for words barter, exchange and truck: Or else, because Fame-thirsting wits, that toyl In golden tearms to trick their gratious stile, With new-found beauties prank each circumstance, Or (at the least) doe new-coyn'd words inhance With current freedom: and again restore Th'old, rusty, mouldy, worm-gnawn words of yore. For, as in Forrests, leaues do fall and spring: Simile. Even so the words, which whilom flourishing, In sweet Orations shin'd with pleasing lustre (Like snowe-white Lillies in a fresh green pasture) Pass now no more; but, banisht from the Court, Dwell with disgrace among the Countrey sort: And those, which Eld's strict doom did disallow, And damn for bullion, go for current now. A happy wit, with gratious iudgement ioyn'd The liberty of a witty, learned, and iudicious Writer. May giue a pasport to the words new coyn'd In his own shop: also adopt the strange: Ingraft the wilde: inriching, with such change His powerfull stile; and with such sundry ammell Painting his phrase, his Prose or Verse enamell. One language hath no law but vse: and still Runs blinde, vnbridled, at the vulgars will. Anothers course is curiously inclos'd In lists of Art; of choice fit words compos'd. One, in the feeble birth, becomming old, Is cradle-toomb'd: another warreth bold With the yeer-spinners. One, vnhappy-founded, Liues in a narrow valley ever bounded: Another 'mong the learned troop doth presse From Alexanders Altars, even to Fez. Excellency of the Hebrew, Greek, &amp; Latin Tongues aboue the rest.And such are now, the Hebrew, Greek, and Latin: Th'Hebrew, because of it we hold the Paten Of Thrice-Eternals ever sacred Word: And, of his Law, That is the first Record. The Greek, as having cunningly compriz'd All kinde of knowledge that may be devis'd. And manly Roman sith the sword vndanted Through all the world her eloquence hath planted. A pleasant introduction to his following Discourse, wherein Poetically He describeth and bringeth in the principall Languages, together with such as haue excelled in each of them.Writing these later lines, weary wel-neer Of sacred Pallas pleasing labours deer; Mine humble chin saluteth oft my brest; With an Ambrosial deaw mine eys possest By peece-meal close; all moving powrs be still; From my dull fingers drops my fainting quill; Down in my sloath-lov'd bed again I shrink; And in dark Lethe all deep cares I sink: Yea, all my cares, except a zeal to len A gainfull pleasure to my Countrymen. For, th'holy loues-charm, burning for their sake, When I am sleeping, keeps my soule awake. The God of Dreams.Gold-winged Morpheus, East-ward issuing By's crystall gate (it earlier opening Then dayes bright door) fantastick leads the way Down to a vale, where moist-cool night, and day, Still calms and storms, keen cold, and sultry smother, Rain, and fair weather follow not each other: But May still raigns, and rose-crown'd Zephyrus With wanton sighes makes the green trees to buss, Whose whispering boughs, in Ovall form do fence This flowrie field's delightfull excellence. Description of the House, and Image of Eloquence: and of the principall Languages.Iust in the midst of this enammeld vale Rose a huge Rock, cut like a Pedestall; And on the Cornich a Colosius stands Of during brasse, which beareth in his hands Both fire and water: from his golden tongue Growe thousand chains, which all the mead a-long Draw worlds of hearers with alluring Art, Bound fast by th'ears, but faster by the hart. Before his feet, Boars, Bears, and Tigers lie As meek as Lambs, reclaim'd from crueltie. Neer hils do hop, and neighbour Forrests bound, Seeming to dance at his sweet voyces sound. Of Carian pillars rais'd with curious Art On bases firm, a double rowe doth girt The soule-charm Image of sweet Eloquence: And these fair Piles (with great magnificence) Bear, foure by foure, one of the Tongues which now Our learned Age for fairest doth allow. The Hebrew supported by 4. Pillars; (viz). Now, 'mong the Heav'n-deer spirits supporting heer The Hebrew tongue, that Prince whose brows appear Like daunt-Earth Comet's Heav'n-adorning brand, Who holds a green-dry, withr'd-springing wand, Moses. And in his armes the sacred Register Of Gods eternall ten-fold Law doth bear; Is Israels guide: first Author, he that first Vnto his heirs his Writings offer durst: Whose hallowed Pages not alone preceed All Grecian Writ, but every Grecian Deed. Dauid's the next, who, with the melody Dauid. Of voyce-matcht fingers, draws sphears harmony, To his Heav'n-tuned harp, which shall resound While the bright day-star rides his glorious Round: Yea (happily) when both the whirling Poles Shall cease their Galliard, th'ever-blessed soules Of Christ his champions (cheer'd with his sweet songs) Shall dance to th'honour of the Strong of strongs; And all the Angels glorie-winged Hostes Sing Holy, Holy, Holy, God of Hoasts. The third, his Son, wit-wondrous Salomon, Salomon. Who in his lines hath more wise lessons sow'n, More golden words, then in his Crown there shin'd Pearls, Diamonds, and other Gemms of Inde. Then, Amos Son, in threatnings vehement, Esay. Grace-followed, graue, holy and eloquent. Sweet-numbred Homer here the Greek supports, Whose School hath bred the many-differing sorts 2. The Greeke by Homer. Plato. Herodotus. Demosthenes. Of antient Sages: and, through every Realm, Made (like a Sea) his eloquence to stream: Plato, the all-divine, who like the Fowl (They call) of Paradise; doth never foul His foot on Earth or Sea, but lofty sties Higher then Heav'n from Hell, aboue the skies: Cleer-styl'd Herodotus, and Demosthen, Gold-mouthed hearts-king, law of learned men. Th'Arch-Foe to factious Catiline and (since) 3. The Latine by Cicero. Cæsar. Salust. Virgil. To Anthony, whose thundring eloquence Yeelds thousand streames, whence (rapt in admiration) The rarest wits are drunk in every Nation: Cæsar, who knowes as well to write, as war: The Sinnewie Salust: and that Heav'n-fall'n star, Which straggling Ilium brings to Tybers brink, Who never seems in all his Works to wink; Who never stumbled, ever cleer and graue; Bashfully-bold, and blushing modest-braue: Still like himself; and else, still like to no-man: Sustain the stately, graue-sweet antient Roman. 4.

Tasso.On mirthfull Boccace is the Tuscan plac't: Bold, choice-tearm'd Petrarch, in deep passions grac't: The fluent fainer of Orlando's error, Smooth, pithy, various, quick affection-stirrer: And witty Tasso, worthy to indight Heroïk numbers, full of life and light; Short, sharpe-conceipted, rich in language cleer, Though last in age, in honour formost heer. 5. The Arabik by Aben-Rois. Eldebag. Auicen. Ibnu-farid.Th'Arabian language hath for pillars sound, Great Aben-Rois most subtill, and profound, Sharp Eldebag, and learned Auicen, And Ibnu-farid's Figure-flowing Pen. 6. The Dutch by Peuther. Luther. Beucer. Butric.The Dutch, hath him who Germaniz'd the story Of Sleidan: next, th'Isleban (lasting glory Of Wittenberg) with Beucer gilding bright His pleasing stile: and Butric my delight. 7. The Spanish by Gueuarra. Boscan. Granada. Garcilaco. Gueuarra, Boscan, and Granade, which sup With Garcilace, in honey Pytho's cup The smiling Nectar, beare th'Hyberian: And, but th'old glory of the Catalan, Rauisht Osyas, he might well haue claymed The Spanish Laurell, 'mong these lastly named. 8. The French by Marot.Now, for the French, that shape-less Column rude, Whence th'idle Mason hath but grosly hew'd (As yet) the rough scales from the vpper part, Is Clement Marot; who with Art-les Art Busily toyls: and, prickt with praise-full thirst, Brings Helicon, from Po to Quercy first: Whom, as a time-torn Monument I honour: Or as a broken Toomb: or tattered Banner: Or age-worn Image: not so much for showe, As for the reuerence that to Eld I owe. The next I knowe not well; yet (at the least) He seems som skilfull Master with the rest: Yet doubt I still. For now it doth appear Amyot.Like Iaques Amyot, then like Viginere. Ronsard.That, is great Ronsard, who his France to garnish, Robs Rome and Greece, of their Art-various varnish; And, hardy-witted, handleth happily All sorts of subiect, stile, and Poesie. And this du Plessis, beating Atheïsme, Plessis. Vain Paganisme, and stubborn Iudaïsme, With their owne Armes: and sacred-graue, and short, His plain-prankt stile he strengthens in such sort, That his quick reasons, wingd with grace and Art, Pearce like keen arrows, every gentle hart. Our English Tongue three famous Knights sustain; 9. The English by Sir Thomas Moore. Sir Nicholas Bacone. Sir Philip Sidney. Moore, Bacone, Sidney: of which former, twain (High Chancelors of England) weaned first Our Infant-phrase (till then but homely nurst) And childish toyes; and rudeness chasing thence, To civill knowledge, ioyn'd sweet eloquence. And (World-mourn'd) Sidney, warbling to the Thames His Swan-like tunes, so courts her coy proud streams, That (all with-childe with Fame) his fame they bear To Thetis lap; and Thetis, every-where. But, what new Sun dazles my tender eyes? What sudden transe rapts me aboue the skies? What Princely Port? O! what imperiall grace? What sweet-bright-lightning looks? what Angels face? Say (learned Heav'n-born Sisters) is not this And the incomparable Queen Elizabeth. That prudent Pallas, Albions Misteris, That Great Eliza, making hers disdain, For any Man, to change their Maidens raign? Who, while Erynnys (weary now of hell) Her prudence, Piety, Iustice, Religion, Learning, and Eloquence. With Fire and Sword her neighbour States doth quell, And while black Horror threats in stormy rage, With dreadfull down-fall th'vniversall stage; In happy Peace her Land doth keep and nourish: Where reverend Iustice, and Religion flourish. Who is not only in her Mother-voice Rich in Oration; but with phrases choice, So on the sudden can discourse in Greek, French, Latin, Tuscan, Dutch, and Spanish eek, That Rome, Rhyne, Rhone, Greece, Spain, and Italy, Plead all for right in her natiuitie. Bright Northren pearl, Mars-daunting martialist, To grace the Muses and the Arts, persist: And (O!) if ever these rude rimes be blest But with one glaunce of Nature's only Best; Or (luckie) light between those Yuory palms, Which holde thy State's stern, in these happy calms, View them with milde aspect; and gently read, That for thy praise, thine eloquence we need. Then thus I spake; O spirits diuine and learned, Whose happy labours haue your lauds eterned: O! sith I am not apt (alas!) nor able With you to bear the burthen honourable Of Albions Fame, nor with my feeble sight So much as follow your Heav'n-neighbouring flight; At least permit me, prostrate to imbrace Your reuerend knees: permit me to inchase Your radiant crests with Aprils flowry Crown; Permit (I pray) that from your high renown, My feeble tunes eternall fames deriue; While in my Songs your glorious names suruiue. End of the Vision.Granting my sute, each of them bowd his head, The valley vanisht, and the pillers fled: And there-with-all, my Dream had flow'n (I think) But that I lim'd his limber wings with ink. FINIS. The Colonies. THE THIRD PART OF THE SECOND DAY OF THE II. WEEK. The Argvment. To stop ambition, Strife, and Auarice, Into Three Parts the Earth diuided is: To Sem the East, to Cham the South; the West To Iapheth falls; their seuerall scopes exprest: Their fruitfull Spawn did all the World supply: Antiquities vncertain Search, and why: Assyria sceptred first; and first imparts, To all the rest, Wealth, Honour, Arms, and Arts: The New-found World: Mens diuers humors strange: The various World a mutuall Counter-change. While through the Worlds vnhanted wilderness Being heere to intreat of the Transmigration of so many Nations, issued out of the loignes of Noah, our Poet desireth to be addressed by som speciall fauour of God. I, th'old, first Pilots wandring House address: While (Famous Drake-like) coasting every strand I do discover many a New-found-Land: And while, from Sea to Sea, with curious pain I plant great Noahs plentious Vine again: What bright-brown cloud shall in the Day protect me? What fiery Pillar shall by Night direct me Toward each Peoples primer Residence, Predestin'd in the Court of Providence, Yer our bi-sexed Parents, free from sin, In Eden did their double birth begin? O sacred Lamp! that went'st so brightly burning Before the Sages, from the spycie Morning, To shew th'Almighty Infants humble Birth; O! chace the thick Clouds, driue the darknes forth Which blindeth me: that mine aduenturous Rime, Circling the World, may search out every Clime. For, though my Wits, in this long Voyage shift The true, &amp; only drift of all his indeuours.From side to side; yet is my speciall drift, My gentle Readers by the hand to bring To that deer Babe, the Man-God, Christ, our King. A comparison expressing the effect of the astonishment, which the confusion of Tongues broght into the Babel-builders. As When the lowring Heav'ns with loudest raps Through Forrests thrill their roaring thunder-claps, The shivering Fowls do suddenly forgo Their nests and perches, fluttering to and fro Through the dark ayr, and round about ther rings A whistling murmur of their whisking wings; The grissell Turtles (seldom seen alone) Dis-payer'd and parted, wander one by one; And even the feeble downie feathered Yong Venture to fly, before their quils be strong: Even so, the Builders of that Babel-Wonder, Hearing Gods voice aloud to roar and thunder In their rude voices barbarous difference, Take all at once their fearfull flight from thence On either hand; and through th'Earth voidly-vast Each packs a-part, where God would haue him plac't. For, Heav'ns great Monarch (yer the World began) Why God would not that the seed of Noah should reside in the Plain of Shynar.Having decreed to giue the World to man; Would not, the same a nest of theeues should be, That with the Sword should share his Legacie; And (brutely mix) with mongrell stock to stoar Our Elements, round, solid, slimy floar: But rather, fire of Couetize to curb, The Earth distributed among the Sons of Noah To Sem, the East.Into three Parts he parts this spacious Orb, 'Twixt Sem and Cham, and Iapheth: Sem the East, Cham South, and Iapheth doth obtain the West. That large rich Countrey, from Perosite shoars (Where stately Ob, the King of Rivers, roars, In Scythian Seas voiding his violent load, But little less then six dayes sayling broad) To Malaca: Moluques Iles, that bear Cloues and Canele: well-tempered Sumater Sub-equinoctiall: and the golden streams Of Bisnagar, and Zeilan bearing gemms: From th'Euxin Sea and surge of Chaldean Twins To th'Anian Streight: the sloathfull sly my Fens Where Quinzay stands; Chiorze, where Buls as big As Elephants are clad in silken shag, Is great Sems Portion. For the Destinies (Or rather Heav'ns immutable Decrees) Assur t'Assyria send, that in short time Chale and Rhesen to the Clouds might climbe, And Niniue (more famous then the rest) Aboue them raise her many-towred Crest: The sceptred Elam chose the Persian Hils, And those fat fields that swift Araxis fils; Lud, Lydia: Aram all Armenia had: And Chalde fell to learned Arphaxad: Cham became Soverain over all those Realms To Cham the South. South-bounded round with Sun-burnt Guinne streams; Botangas, Benin, Cephal, Guaguametre, Hot Concritan, too-full of poysonie matter; North-ward with narrow Mid-terranean Sea Which from rich Europe parts poor Africa: Tow'rds where Titans Euening splendor sank, With Seas of Fez, Cape-verde, and Cape-blanc: And tow'rds where Phœbus doth each morning wake, With Adel Ocean and the Crimsin Lake. And further, all that lies between the steep Mount Libanus, and the Arabian Deep, Between th'Erythrean Sea, and Persian Sine, He (mighty Prince) to's Afrik State doth ioyne. His Darling Canaan doth nigh Iordan dwell (One-day ordain'd to harbour Israel): Put peopled Lybia: Mizriam Egypt mann'd: And's first-born Chus the Æthyopian strand. Iapheth extends from struggling Hellespont, To Iapheth the North &amp; West. The Tane and Euxin Sea, to th'double Mount Of famous Gibraltar, and that deep Main, Whose tumbling billows bathe the shoars of Spain: And from those Seas, where in the steed of Keels Of winged Ships they roule their Chariot wheels, To the Marsilian, Morean, and Thyrrhenian; Ligurian Seas, and learned Sea Athenian, Iust opposite to Asia rich in spice, Pride of the Word, and second Paradise: And that large Countrey stretcht from Amana To Tanais shoars, and to the source of Rha. Forth of his Gomers loigns (they say) sprung all The war-like Nations scattered over Gaul, And Germains too (yerst called Gomerits): From Tubal, Spaniards: and from Magog, Scythes: From Madai, Medes: from Mesech, Mazacans: From Iauan, Greeks: from Thyras, Thracians. Heer, if I list, or lov'd I rover-shooting, According to his accustomed modesty &amp; discretion, the Poet chaseth rather Silence then to speak vncertainly of things vnknowne. Or would I follow the vncertain footing Of false Berosus and such fond Deluders (Their zealous Readers insolent Illuders) I could deriue the lineall Descents Of all our Sires; and name you every Prince Of every Province, in his time and place (Successiuely) through-out his Ancient Race: Yea, sing the Worlds so divers populations; And of least Cities showe the first Foundations. But, never will I so my sails abandon To every blast, and rowing so at randon (Without the bright light of that glorious Star (Which shines 'boue all the Heav'ns) venture so far On th'vnknowne surges of so vast a Sea So full of Rocks and dangers every way; Having no Pylot, saue som brain-sick Writers Which coyn Kings names, vain fabulous Inditers Of their own fancies, who (affecting glory) Vpon a Flyes foot build a goodly story. Reasons why the search of such Antiquities is so obscure.Som words allusion is no certain ground Whereon a lasting Monument to found: Sith fairest Rivers, Mountains strangely steep, And largest Seas, never so vast and deep (Though self-eternall, resting still the same) Through sundry chances often change their name: Sith it befals not alwayes, that his feed Who builds a Town, doth in the same succeed: And (to conclude) sith vnder Heav'n, no Race Perpetually possesseth any place: But, as all Tenants at the High Lords will, We hold a Field, a Forrest, or a Hill: And (as when winde the angry Ocean moues) Waue hunteth waue, and billow billow shoues: So do all Nations iustle each the other, And so one People doth pursue another; And scarce the second hath a first vn-housed, Before a third him thence again haue rowsed. Famous examples to this purpose. Of the ancient Britains. Of the Lombards.So, th'ancient Britain, by the Saxons chac't From's natiue Albion, soon the Gaules displac't From Armonik; and then victoriously (After his name) surnam'd that, Britannie. So, when the Lombard had surrendered Fair, double-named Isthers flowry-bed To scar-fac't Hunnes; he hunteth furiously The rest of Gaules from wealthy Insubrie; Which after fell in French-mens hands again, Won by the sword of Worthy Charlemain. Of the Alains, Goths and Vandals.So, th'Alain and North Vandal, beaten both From Corduba and Seuil by the Goth, Seiz'd Carthage straight; which after-ward they lost To wise Iustinians valiant Roman Hoast: And Romans, since, ioyn'd with the barbarous troop Of curled Moors, vnto th'Arabians stoop. The sacrilegious greedy appetite The causes of such Transmigrations. Of Gold and Scepters glistering glorious bright, The thirst of Vengeance, and that puffing breath Of elvish Honour built on blood and death, On desolation, rapes and robberies, Flames, ruins, wracks, and brutish butcheries, Vn-bound all Countries, making war-like Nations Through every Clymat seek new habitations. I speak not heer of those Alarbian Rovers, Numidian Shepheards; or Tartarian Drovers, Who shifting pastures for their store of Cattle: Do heer and there their hairy Tents imbattle: Like the black swarms of Swallows swiftly-light, Which twice a-year cross with their nimble flight The Pine-plough'd Sea, and (pleas'd with purest ayr) Seek every Season for a fresh repair: But other Nations fierce, who far and nigh With their own bloods-price purchast Victory; Who, better knowing how to win, then wield; Conquer, then keep; to batter, then to build; And brauely choosing rather War then Peace, Haue over-spread the World by Land and Seas. Such was the Lombard, who in Schonland nurst, The originall removes, voiages, &amp; conquests of the Lombards. On Rugeland and Liuonia seized first. Then having well reveng'd on the Bulgarian The death of Agilmont, the bold Barbarian Surpriseth Poland; thence anon he presses In Rhines fair streams to rinse his Amber tresses: Thence turning back, he seats him in Morauia; After, at Buda; thence he postes to Pauia; There raigns two hundred years: triumphing so, That royall Tesin might compare with Po. Such was the Goth, who whilom issuing forth Of the Goths. From the cold, frozen Ilands of the North, Imcampt by Vistula: but th'Air (almost) Being there as cold as on the Baltick Coast, He with victorious arms Sclavonia gains, The Transylvanian and Valacchian Plains. Thence plies to Thracia: and then (leaving Greeks) Greedy of spoil, foure times he bravely seeks To snatch from Rome (then, Mars his Minion) The Palms which she o'r all the World had won; Guided by Rhadaguise, and Alaric, And Vidimarius, and Theodoric: Then coms to Gaul: and thence repulst, his Legions Rest ever since vpon the Spanish Regions. Such th'antik Gaul: who, roving every way, Of the ancient Gaules. As far as Phœbus darts his golden ray, Seiz'd Italy; the Worlds proud Mistress sackt Which rather Mars then Romulus compackt: Then pill'd Panonia: then with conquering ploughs He furrows-vp cold Strymons slymie sloughs: Wastes Macedonia: and (inclin'd to fleece) Spares not to spoyl the greatest Gods of Greece: Then (cloyd with Europe) th'Hellespont he past, And there Mount Ida's neighbour world did waste: Spoyleth Pisidia: Mysia doth inthrall: And midst of Asia plants another Gaul. Most famous Peoples dark Antiquity, Is as a Wood: where bold Temerity Stumbles each step; and learned Diligence If selfe intangles; and blind Ignorance (Groping about in such Cimmerian nights) In pits and ponds, and boggs, and quag-mires lights. He affirmeth finally that the three Sons of Noah peopled the world, and sheweth how.It shall suffice me therefore (in this doubt) But (as it were) to coast the same about: And, rightly tun'd vnto the golden string Of Amrams Son, in gravest verse to sing, That Sem, and Cham, and Iapheth did re-plant Th'vn-peopled World with new inhabitant: And that again great Noahs wandring Boat The second time o'r all the World did float. Not that I send Sem, at one flight vnceast, From Babylon vnto the farthest East, Tartarian Chorats silver waues t'eslay, And people China, Cambula, Cathay, Iapheth to Spain: and that profanest Cham, To thirsty Countries Meder' and Bigam, To Cephala vpon Mount Zambrica, And Cape of Hope, last coign of Africa. 2. Fit comparisons to represent the same.For, as Hymetus and Mount Hybla were Not over-spread and covered in one year With busie Bees; but yearly twice or thrice Each Hyue supplying new-com Colonies (Heav'ns tender Nurcelings) to those fragrant Mountains, At length their Rocks dissolv'd in Hony Fountains: Or rather, as two fruitfull Elms that spred Amidst a Cloase with brooks environed, Ingender other Elms about their roots; Those, other still; and still, new-springing shoots So over-growe the ground, that in fewe years The somtimes-Mead a great thick Groue appears: Even so th'ambitious Babel-building rout, Disperst, at first go seat themselues about Mesopotamia: after (by degrees) Their happy Spawn, in sundry Colonies Crossing from Sea to Sea, from Land to Land, All the green-mantled neather Globe hath mann'd: So that, except th'Almighty (glorious Iudge Of quick and dead) this World's ill dayes abbridge, Ther shall no soyl so wilde and savage be, But shall be shadowed by great Adams Tree. Therefore, those Countries neerest Tigris Spring, Why the first Monarkie began in Assyria. In those first ages were most flourishing, Most spoken-of, first Warriors, first that guide, And giue the Law to all the Earth beside. Babylon (living vnder th'awfull grace Of Royall Greatness) sway'd th'Imperiall Mace, Before the Greeks had any Town at all, Or warbling Lute had built the Dircean Wall: Yer Gauls had houses, Latins Burgages, Our Britains Tents, or Germans Cotages. The Hebrews had with Angels Conversation, The Hebrewes and their next neighbors were religious and learned before the Grecians knew any thing. Held th'Idol-Altars in abhomination, Knew the Vnknowen, with eyes of Faith they saw Th'invisible Messias, in the Law: The Chaldees, Audit of the Stars had made, Had measur'd Heav'n, conceiv'd how th'Earths thick shade Eclipst the silver brows of Cynthia bright, And her brown shadow quencht her brothers light. The Memphian Priests were deep Philosophers, And curious gazers on the sacred Stars, Searchers of Nature, and great Mathematicks; Yer any Letter, knew the ancient'st Atticks. Proud Ægypt glistred all with golden Plate, The Egyptians, &amp; Tyrians had their fill of Riches and Pomp, &amp; Pleasure, before the Greeks or Gauls know what the world meant. Yer the lame Lemnian (vnder Ætna grate) Had hammer'd yron; or the Vultur-rented Prometheus, 'mong the Greeks had fire invented. Gauls were not yet; or, were they (at the least) They were but wilde; their habit, plumes; their feast, But Mast and Acorns, for the which they gap't Vnder the Trees when any winde had hapt: When the bold Tyrians (greedy after gain) Durst rowe about the salt-blew Africk Main; Traffikt abroad, in Scarlet Robes were drest, And pomp and pleasure Euphrates possest. For, as a stone, that midst a Pond ye fling, About his fall first forms a little ring, Wherein, new Circles one in other growing (Through the smooth Waters gentle-gentle flowing) Still one the other more and more compell From the Ponds Centre, where the stone first fell; Till at the last the largest of the Rounds From side to side 'gainst every bank rebounds: So, from th'Earth's Centre (which I heer suppose About the Place where God did Tongues transpose) Man (day by day his wit repolishing) Makes all the Arts through all the Earth to spring, As he doth spread, and shed in divers shoals His fruitfull Spawn, round vnder both the Poles. The first Colonies of Sem in the East.Forth from Assyria, East-ward then they trauell Towards rich Hytanis with the golden grauell: Then people they the Persian Oroâtis; Then cleer Choaspis, which doth humbly kiss The Walls of Susa; then the Vallies fat Neer Caucasus, where yerst th'Arsaces sat: Then mann they Media; then with humane seed, Towards the Sea th'Hyrcanian Plain they speed. The second.The Sons of these (like flowing Waters) spred O'r all the Countrey which is bordered With Chiesel River, 'boue Thacalistan; Gadel and Cabul, Bedan, Balestan. The third.Their off-spring then, with fruitfull stems doth stoar Basinagar, Nayard, and either shoar Of famous Ganges; Aua Toloman, The Kingdom Mein, the Musky Charazan; And round about the Desart Op, where oft By strange Phantasmas Passengers are scoft. The fourth.Som ages after, linkt in divers knots, Tipur they take, rich in Rhinocerots; Caichin, in Aloes; Mangit, and the shoar Of Quinz' and Anie lets them spread no more. First Colonies of Iapheth in the West.From that first Centre to the West-ward bending, Old Noahs Nephews far and wide extending, Seiz less Armenia; then, within Cilicia, Possess the Ports of Tharsis and of Issea, And the delicious strange Corycian Caue (Which warbling sound of Cymbals seems to haue) Iönia, Cappadocia, Taurus horns, Bythinia, Troas, and Meanders turns. The second.Then passing Sestos Straights; of Strymon cold, Herber and Nest they quaff; and pitch their Fold In vales of Rhodope, and plow the Plains Where great Danubius neer his death complains. The third diuided into many branches.On th'other side, Thrace subtle Greece beswarms; Greece, Italy (famous for Art and Arms): Italy, France; France, Spain, and Germany (Rhines fruitfull bed) and our Great Britany. On th'other side, it spreads about Moldauia, Mare-Maiour, Podolia, and Morauia, With Transyluania, Seruia, and Panonia, The Prussian Plains, and over all Polonia: The verge of Vistula, and farther forth Beyond the Alman, drawing to the North. Now turn thee South-ward: see, see how Chaldea. First Colonies of Cham, toward the South. Spews on Arabia, Phœnice, and Iudea, Chams cursed Ligne, which (over-fertill all) Between two Seas doth into Ægypt fall; Sowes all Cyrenia, and the famous Coast Whereon the roaring Punik Sea is tost: Fez, Dara, Argier, Galate, Guzol, Aden, Terminan, Tombut, Melle, Gago, Gogden: The sparkling Desarts of sad Libya, Zeczec, Benin, Borno Cano Nubia, And scalding quick-sands of those thirsty Plains Where Iesvs name (yet) in som reverence raigns; Where Prester Iohn (though part he Iudaize) Doth in som sort devoutly Christianize. But would'st thou knowe, how that long Tract, that lies Colonies of the North. Vnder Heav'ns starry Coach, covered with yce, And round embraced in the winding arms Of Cronian Seas (which Sol but seldom warmes) Came peopled first? Suppose, that passing by The Plains where Tigris twice keeps company With the far-flowing silver Euphrates, They lodg'd at foot of hoary Nyphates: And from Armenia, then Iberia mann'd, Albania, Colchis and Bosphorian strand: And then from thence, toward the bright Leuant, That vast Extent, where now fell Tartars hant In wandring troops; and towards th'other side Which (neer her scource) long Volga doth divide, Moscouy Coast, Permia, Liuonia, Prussia, Biarmia, Scrifinia White-Lake, Lappia, Russia. But whence (say you) had that New-World his Guests, How the New-found World (discouered in our Time) came peopled. A double question. Which Spain (like Delos floting on the Seas) Late digg'd from darknes of Oblivions Graue, And it vndoing, it new Essence gaue? If long agoe; how should it hap that no-man Knew it till now? no Persian, Greek, no Roman; Whose glorious Peers, victorious Armies guiding O're all the World, of this had never tyding? If but of late; how swarm their Cities since So full of Folk? how pass their Monuments Th'Ægyptian Spires, Mausolus stately Toomb, The Wals and Courts of Babylon and Rome? Why! think ye (fond) those people fell from Heav'n 1 Answer. All-ready-made; as in a Sommer Ev'n After a sweltring Day, som sultry showr Doth in the Marshes heaps of Tadpals pour, Which in the ditches (chapt with parching weather) Lie crusht and croaking in the Mud together? Or else, that setting certain slips, that fixt Their slender roots the tender mould betwixt, They saw the light of Phœbus lyuening face; Having, for milk, moist deaws; for Cradle, grass: Or that they grew out of the fruitfull Earth, As Toad-stools, Turneps, Leeks, and Beets haue birth? Or (like the bones that Cadmus yerst did sowe) Were bravely born armed from top to toe? That spacious Coast, now call'd America, Was not so soon peopled as Africa; (Th'ingenious, Towr-full, and Law-loving Soil, Which, Ioue did with his Lemans name en-stile) And that which from cold Bosphorus doth spread To pearl'd Auroras Saffron-coloured Bed. Because, they ly neerer the diapry verges Of tear-bridge Tigris Swallow-swifter surges, Whence our amaz'd first Grand-sires faintly fled, And like sprung Partridge every-where did spred; Except that World, where-vnder Castiles King, Famous Columbus Force and Faith did bring. But the rich buildings rare magnificence, Th'infinit Treasures, various gouernments, Showe that long since (although at sundry times) 'T had Colonies (although from sundry Climes): Whether the violence of tempestuous weather Som broken Vessels haue inforced thither; Whether som desperat, dire extremity Of Plague, War, Famin; or th'Authority Of som braue Typhis (in adventure tost) Brought weary Carvels on that Indian Coast. Coniectures touching the Peopling of the same.Who maketh doubt but yerst the Quinzay Fraights As well might venture through the Anian Straights, And finde as easie and as short a way From the East Indies to the Tolguage Bay, As vsually the Asian Ships are wont To pass to Greece a-cross the Hellespont: Spaniards to Fez, a-thwart the Straight Abilia: Through Messine stream th'Italians to Sicilia? From Tolm and Quiuir's spacious Plains (wherein Bunch backed Calues, with Horse-like manes are seen, And Sheep-like Fleece) they fill Azasia, Toua, Topir, Canada, Cossia, Mecchi, Auacal, Calicuaz, Bacalos, Los Campos de Labor (where Floods are froze). Wonders of the New-found World.On th'other side, Xalisco soyl they Man (Now new Galizia) Cusule, Mechuacan: And cunningly in Mexik Sea they pile Another Venice (or a City-Ile). Strange things there see they (that amaze them much) Green Trees to wither with their very touch; And in Nicaragua, a Mountain top, That (Ætna-like) bright Flashes belches vp. Thence, reach they th'Isthmos of rich Panama, And on their right hand build Oucanama, With Cassamalca, Cusco, Quito: and In famous Peru's very golden Strand Admire the Lake that laveth Colle about, Whose Waves be salt within, and fresh without: And streams of Cinca, that, with vertue strange, To hardest stone soft Mud and Chalk do change. Then seiz they Chili, where all day the Deep Runs roaring down, and all the night doth sleep: Chinca, the Patagons, and all the shoar Where th'azure Seas of Magellan do roar. Left-ward, they spread them 'longst the Darians side; Where through th'Vrabian Fields the Huo doth slide, Neer Zenu's stream, which toward the Ocean drags Pure grains of Gold, as big as Pullets eggs: To new Granada, where the Mount embost With Emeralds doth shine; Cumanean Coast, Where noysom vapours (like a dusky night) Bedimms their eyes, and doth impair their sight: Therefore som troops from Cumana they carry To Caripana, Omagu and Pari: By Maragnon, all over fell Brasile, And Plate's fat Plains, where flowes another Nile. Ghess too, that Grotland yerst did Picne store, And Ireland fraught Los Campos de Labor; As Tombut, Melli, Gago and Terminan, Planted the Plains and shoars of Corican. Yet (happely) thou'lt gladly grant me this, How it was possible that Noah and his Sons should so multiply. That mans ambition ay so bound-less is, That steepest Hils it over-climbs with ease, And runs (as dry-shod) through the deepest Seas: And (maugre meagre Thirst) her Carvels Lands On Afrik, Tolmon, and Arabian sands; But hardly credit'st, that one Family Out of foure couples should so multiply, That Asia, Europ, Africa, and All Seems for their off-spring now too straight and small. If thou set-light by th'everlasting Voice, 1. Answer. Which now again re-blest the Love-full choice Of sacred Wedlocks secret binding band; Saying, Increase, Flourish and Fill the Land: And if (profane) thou hold it for a Fiction, That Seauenty Iewes, in Ægypt (in affliction) Within foure-hundred yeers and half three-score, Grew to fiue-hundred-thousand soules and more: Consider yet, that being fed that while With holesom Fruits of an vn-forced soil, And kindly meats, not marred by the Book, And wanton cunning of a sawcy Cook; Waigh furthermore, that being not cut-down With bloody swords when furious neighbours frown; Nor worn with Travell, nor enfeebled With hatefull Sloth; Our Grand-sires flourished Hundreds of yeers in youth; and even in Age Could render duly Venus Escuage: And that Polygamy (in those dayes common) Most Men vsurping more then one sole Woman, Made then the World so mightily augment In vpright Creatures; and (incontinent) From fruitfull loins of one old Father-stock, So many branches of man-kinde to flock: Comparison to that purpose.Even as an ear of Corn (if all the yield Be yeerly sow'n still in a fertill Field) Fils Barns at length; and spreads in spacious Plain Millions of millions of like ears again. Or, as two Fishes, cast into a Meer, With fruitfull Spawn will furnish in few yeer A Town with victuall, and serve (furthermore) Their neighbour Waters with their Fry to store. An example of our daies.Have not our Daies a certain Father know'n, Who, with the fruit of his own body grow'n, Peopled a Village of a hundred Fires, And issue-blest (the Crown of Old Desires) In his own life-time, his own off-spring saw To wed each other without breach of Law? So far, the branches of his fruitfull Bed Past all the Names of Kinreds-Tree did spred. Another example.'Tis know'n, that few Arabian Families New-planted Lybia with their Progenies, In compass of three hundred yeers and less; And Bugi, Argier, Oran, Thunis, Tez, Fez, Melli, Gago, Tonbut, Terminan With hatefull Laws of Heathnish Alcoran. If this among the Africans we see, Whom cor'zive humour of Melancholy Doth alwaies tickle with a wanton Lust, Although less powrfull in the Paphian Ioust For Propagation (for, too-often Deed Of Loues-Delight, enfeebles much their seed: And inly still they feel a Wintery Fever; As outwardly, a scorching Sommer ever) Ghess how much more, those, whose hoar heads approach And see the turnings of Heav'ns flaming Coach, Doo multiply; because they seldom venter, And, but in season, Venus lists to enter. And, the cold, resting (vnder th'Artick Star) Still Master of the Field in champian War, Makes Heat retire into the Bodies-Towr: Which, there vnited, gives them much more powr. From thence indeed, Hunns, Herules, Franks, Bulgarians, The North hath exceedingly multiplyed in people: the South not so. Circassyans, Sweves, Burgognians, Turks, Tartarians, Dutch, Cimbers, Normans, Alains, Ostrogothes, Tigurins, Lombards, Vandals, Visigothes, Have swarm'd (like Locusts) round about this Ball, And spoil'd the fairest Provinces of all: While barren South had much a-doo t'assemble (In all) two Hoasts; that made the North to tremble: Whereof; the One, that one-ey'd Champion led, Who famous Carthage rais'd and ruined: Th'other (by Tours) Charles Martell martyr'd so, That never since, could Afrik Army showe. O! see how full of Wonders strange is Nature: Wh?ce our Author takes occasion to enter into an excellent discourse of Gods wondrous work in the divers temperatures, qualities, complexions, and manners also many Nations in the World. Sith in each Climat, not alone in stature, Strength, hair and colour, that men differ doo, But in their humours and their manners too. Whether that, Custom into Nature change: Whether that, Youth to th'Elds example range: Or divers Laws of divers Kingdoms, vary-vs: Or th'influence of Heav'nly bodies, cary-vs. The Northern-man is fair, the Southern foul; That's white, this black; that smiles, and this doth scoul: Th'one's blithe and frolick, th'other dull and froward; Th'one's full of courage, th'other fearfull coward: Th'ones hair is harsh, big, curled, th'other's slender; Th'one loveth Labour, th'other Books doth tender: Th'one's hot and moist, the other hot and dry; Th'ones Voice is hoarse, the other's cleer and high: Th'one's plain and honest, th'other all deceipt: Th'one's rough and rude, the other handsom neat: Th'one (giddy-brain'd) is turn'd with every winde: The other (constant) never changeth minde: Th'one's loose and wanton, th'other continent; Th'one thrift-less lavish, th'other provident: Th'one milde Companion; th'other, stern and strange (Like a wilde Wolf) loves by himself to range: Th'one's pleas'd with plainness, th'other pomp affects: Th'one's born for Arms, the other Arts respects. But middling folk, who their abiding make Between these two, of either guise partake: And such have stronger limbs; but weaker wit, Then those that neer Niles fertill sides do sit; And (opposite) more wit, and lesser force, Then those that haunt Rhines and Danubius shoars. For, in the Cirque of th'Vniversall City; The Southern-man, who (quick and curious-witty) Builds all on Dreams, deep Extasies and Transes, Who measures Heav'ns eternall-moving Dances, Whose searching soule can hardly be suffiz'd With vulgar Knowledge, holds the Place of Priest. The Northern-man, whose wit in's Fingers settles, Who what him list can work in Wood and Mettles, Who (Salmon-like) can thunder counterfait; With men of Arms, and Artizans is set. The Third (as knowing well to rule a State) Holds, gravely-wise, the room of Magistrate. Th'one (to be briefe) loves studious Theory, The other Trades, the third deep Policy. Yet true it is, that since som later lustres, Minerva, Themis, Hermes and his Sisters Have set, as well, their Schools in th'Artick Parts, As Mars his Lists, and Vulcan Shops of Arts. Notable differences between the Nations of Europe.Nay, see we not among our selves, that live Mingled almost (to whom the Lord doth give But a small Turf of earth to dwell-vpon) This wondrous ods in our condition? We finde the Alman in his fight courageous, But salable; th'Italian too-outrageous; Sudden the French, impatient of delay; The Spaniard slowe, but suttle to betray: Th'Alman in Counsell cold, th'Italian quick, The French in constant, Spaniards politick: Especially French, German, Italian, and Spaniard.Fine feeds th'Italian, and the Spaniard spares; Prince-like the French, Pig-like the Alman, fares: Milde speaks the French, the Spaniard proud and brave; Rudely the Alman, and th'Italian grave: Th'Italian proud in 'tire, French changing much; Fit-clad the Spaniard, and vn-fit the Dutch: The French man braves his Fo, th'Italian cheers-him; The Alman spoils, the Spaniard never bears-him: The French-man sings, th'Italian seems to bleat; The Spaniard whines, the Alman howleth great; Spaniards like Iugglers iet, th'Alman; like Cocks; The French goes quick, th'Italian like an Ox: Dutch Lovers proud, th'Italian envious; Frolick the French, the Spaniard furious. Yet would the Lord, that Noahs fruitfull Race Causes why the Lord would haue Mankinde so dispersed ouer all the World. Should over-spread th'Earths vniversall Face: That, drawing so his Children from the crimes Which seem peculiar to their Native Climes, He might reveal his grace: and that Heav'ns lights Might well incline (but not constrain) our sprights: That over all the World, his Saints alwaies Might offer him sweet Sacrifice of Praise: That from cold Scythia his high Name as far Mighthy resound as Sun-Burnt Zanzibar: And that the treasures which strange Soils produce, Might not seem worth-less for the want of vse; But that the In-land Lands might truck and barter, And vent their Wares about to every Quarter. The World compared to a mighty City, wherein dwell people of all conditions, continually trafficking together and exchanging their particular commodities, for benefit of the Publike.For, at in London (stuft with every sort) Her's the Kings Palace, there the Innes of Court: Heer (to the Thames-ward all a-long the Strand) The stately Houses of the Nobles stand: Heer dwell rich Merchants; there Artificers: Heer Stik man, Mercers, Gold-Smiths, Iewellers: There's Church-yard furnisht with choice of Books; Heer stand the Shambles, there the Rowe of Cooks: Heer wonn Vp-Hosters, Haber dashers, Horners; There Pothecaries, Gracers, Tailours, Tourners: Heer Shoo-makers; there Ioyners, Coopers, Coriers; Heer Brewers, Bakers, Cutlers, Felters, Furriers: This Street is full of Drapers, that of Diars; This Shop with Tapers, that with Womens Tiars: For costly Toys, silk Stockings, Cambrick, Lawn, Heer's choice-full Plenty in the curious Pawn: And all's but an Exchange, where (briefly) no man Keeps ought as private. Trade makes all things common So com our Sugars from Canary Iles: From Candy, Currance, Muskadels and Oyls: From the Moluques, Spices: Balsamum From Egypt: Odours from Arabia com: From India, Drugs, rich Gemms and Ivory: From Syria, Mummy: black-red Ebony, From burning Chus: from Peru, Pearl and Gold: From Russia, Furres (to keep the rich from cold) From Florence, Silks: from Spain, Fruit, Saffron, Sacks From Denmark, Amber, Cordage, Firres and Flax: From France and Flanders, Linnen, Woad and Wine: From Holland, Hops: Horse, from the banks of Rhine. In brief, each Country (as pleas'd God distribute) To the Worlds Treasure paies a sundry Tribute. And, as somtimes that sumptuous Persian Dame Man, lord of the world: which for the commodity of his life contributes bountifully all manner of necessaries. (Out of her Pride) accustomed to name One Province for her Robe, her Rail another, Her Partlet this, her Pantofles the tother, This her rich Mantle, that her royall Chain, This her rare Bracelets, that her stately Train: Even so may Man. For, what wilde Hill so steep? What so waste Desart? what so dangerous Deep? What Sea so wrackfull? or so barren Shoar In all the World may be suppos'd so poor, But yeelds him Rent; and, free from envious spight, Contributes frankly to his Lifes Delight? The same more especially dilated in the particulars.Th'inammell'd Vallies, where the liquid glass Of silver Brooks in curled streams doth pass, Serve vs for Gardens; and their flowry Fleece Affords vs Sithe-work yeerly twice or thrice; The Plains for Corn; the swelling Downs for Sheep; Small Hills for Vines; the Mountains strangely-steep (Those Heav'n-climb Ladders, Labyrinths of Wonder, Cellars of Winde, and Shops of Sulph'ry Thunder; Where stormy Tempests have their vgly birth; Which thou mis-call'st the blemish of the Earth; Thinking (profane) that God, or Fortune light, Made them of envy, or of oversight) Bound with eternall bounds proud Emperies; Bear mighty Forrests, full of Timber-Trees (Whereof thou buildest Ships, and Houses fair, To trade the Seas, and fence thee from the Air) Spew spacious Rivers full of fruitfull breed, Which neighbour-Peoples with their plenty feed; Fatten the Earth, with fresh, sweet, fertill mists; Drive gainfull Mills; and serve for Forts and Lists To stop the Fury of War's waste-full hand, And ioyn to th'Sea the middle of the Land. The Wildes and Desarts, which so much amaze-thee, Are goodly Pastures, that do daily graze-thee Millions of Beasts for tillage, and (besides) Store thee with Flesh, with Fleeces, and with Hides. Yea, the vast Sea (which seems but onely good To drown the World, and cover with his Flood So many Countries, where we else might hope For thrifty pains to reap a thankfull Crop) Is a large Lardar, that in briny Deeps, To nourish thee, a World of Creatures keeps: A plentious Victualler, whose provisions serve Millions of Cities that else needs must starve (Like half-dead Dolphins, which the Ebb lets ly Gasping for thirst vpon the sand, a-dry): 'T increaseth Trade, Iournies abbreviates, The flitting Clouds it cease-less exhalates; Which, cooling th'air, and gushing down in rain, Make Ceres Sons (in sight) to mount amain. But, shall I still be Boreas Tennis-ball? Heer (as it were) wearied with so long a voiage, from so broad &amp; bottomless an Ocean (in imitation of the inimitable Author) the Translater hoping kinde intertainment, puts in for the Port of England: whose happy praises he prosecutes at large; Concluding with a zelous Prayer for preservation of the King, and prosperity of his Kingdom. Shall I be still stern Neptunes tossed Thrall? Shall I no more behold thy native smoak, Dear Ithaca? Alas! my Bark is broak, And leaks so fast, that I can rowe no more: Help, help (my Mates) make haste vnto the shoar: O! we are lost; vnless som friendly banks Quickly receive our Tempest-beaten planks. Ah, curteous England, thy kinde arms I see Wide-stretched out to save and welcom me. Thou (tender Mother) wilt not suffer Age To snowe my locks in Forrein Pilgrimage; That fell Brasile my breath-less Corps should shrowd, Or golden Peru of my praise be proud, Or rich Cathay to glory in my Verse. Thou gav'st me Cradle: thou wilt give me Herse. All hail (dear Albion) Europ's Pearl of price, The Worlds rich Garden, Earths rare Paradise: Thrice-happy Mother, which ay bringest forth Such Chiualry as daunteth all the Earth (Planting the Trophies of thy glorious Arms By Sea and Land, where ever Titan warms): Such Artizans as do wel-neer Eclipse Fair Natures praise in peer-lesse Workmanships: Such happy Wits, as Egypt, Greece and Rome (At least) have equall'd, if not overcom; And shine among their (Modern) learned Fellows, As Gold doth glister among paler Yellows: Or as Apollo th'other Planets passes: Or as His Flowr excels the Medow-grasses. Thy Rivers, Seas thy Cities, Shires do seem; Civil in manners, as in buildings trim: Sweet is thine Air, thy Soil exceeding Fat, Fenç't from the World (as better worth then That) With triple Wall (of Water Wood and Brass) Which never Stranger yet had powr to pass; Save when the Heav'ns have, for thy hainous Sin, By som of Thine, with false Keys let them in. About thy borders (O Heav'n-blessed Ile) There never crawls the noysom Crocodile; Nor Bane-breath'd Serpent, basking in thy sand, Measures an Acre of thy flowry Land, The swift-foot Tiger, or fierce Lioness Haunt not thy Mountains, nor thy Wilderness; Nor ravening Wolves worry thy tender Lambs, Bleating for help vnto their help-less Dams; Nor suttle Sea-Horse, with deceitfull Call, Intice thy Children in thy Floods to fall. What though thy Thames and Tweed have never rowl'd, Among their gravell, massy grains of Gold? What though thy Mountains spew no Silver streams? Though every Hillock yeeld not precious Gemms? Though in thy Forrests hang no Silken Fleeces? Nor sacred Incense, nor delicious Spices? What though the clusters of thy colder Vines Distill nat Clarets, Sacks, nor Muscadines? Yet are thy Woolls, thy Corn, thy Cloth, thy Tin, Mines rich enough to make thee Europes Queen, Yea Empress of the World; Yet not sufficient To make thee thankfull to the Cause efficient Of all thy Blessings: Who, besides all this, Hath (now nine Lustres) lent thee greater Bliss; His blessed Word (the witnes of his fauour) To guide thy Sons vnto his Son (their Saver) With Peace and Plenty: while, from War and Want, Thy neighbours Countries never breathed scant. And last, not least (so far beyond the scope Of Christians Fear, and Anti-Christians Hope) When all, thy Fall seem'd to Prognosticate, Hath higher rais'd the glory of thy State; In raysing Stvards to thy regal Throne, To Rule (as David and as Salomon) With Prudence, Prowesse, Iustice, and Sobriety, Thy happy People in Religious Piety. O too too happy! too too fortunate, Knew'st thou thy Weal: or were thou not ingrate. But least (at last) Gods righteous wrath consume vs, If on his patience still we thus presume-vs: And least (at last) all Blessings had before Double in Curses to torment-vs more: Dear Mother England, bend thine aged knee, And to the Heav'ns lift vp thy hands with me; Off with thy Pomp, hence with thy Pleasures past: Thy Mirth be Mourning, and thy Feast a Fast: And let thy soule, with my sad soule, confesse Our former sins, and foul vnthankfulnes. Pray we the Father, through th'adopting Spirit, Not measure vs according to our merit; Nor strictly weigh, at his high Iustice Beam, Our bold Rebellions, and our Pride extream: But, for his Son (our dear Redeemer's) sake, His Sacrifice, for our Sins Ransom, take; And, looking on vs with milde Mercies Ey, Forgive our Past, our Future Sanctifie; That never more, his Fury are incense To strike (as now) with raging Pestilence (Much lesse provoke him by our guilt so far, To wound vs more with Famine and with War. Lord, cease thy wrath: Put vp into thy Quiver This dreadfull shaft: Dear Father, vs deliver: And vnder wings of thy protection keep Thy Servant Iames, both waking and a-sleep: And (furthermore) we (with the Psalmist) sing, Lord, give thy iudgements to (our Lord) the King, Psalm. 72. And to his Son: and let there ay beene Of his Male Seed to sit vpon his Throne, To feed thy Folk in Iacob, and (advance) In Israel thy (dear) Inheritance, And (long-long-lived) full of Faith and Zeal, Reform (like Asa) Church and Common-weal; Raysing poor Vertue, razing proudest Vice, Without respect of Person or of Price; That all bold Atheists, all Blaspheamers, then, All Popish Traitors may be weeded clean. And, Curst be All that say not heer, Amen. FINIS. The Colvmnes. THE IIII. PART OF THE SECOND DAY OF THE II. WEEK. The Argvment. Seth's Pillars found: Heber instructs his Son In th'vse thereof, and who them first begun; Opens the One, and findes, on severall Frames, Foure lively Statues of foure lovely Dames (The Mathematiks) furnisht each apart With Equipages of their severall Art: Wonders of Numbers and Geometry: New Observations in Astronomy: Musiks rare force: Canaan (the Cursed) cause Of Hebers stop; and Bartas witty pause. Being about to treat of the Mathematiks, our Poet heer imploreth especiall assistance in handling so high and difficult a Subiect. If ever (Lord) the purest of my Soule In sacred Rage were rapt above the Pole: If ever, by thy Spirit my spirit inspir'd, Offred thee Layes that learned France admir'd: Father of Light, Fountain of learned Art, Now, now (or never) purge my purest part: Now quintessence my Soule, and now advance My care-free Powrs in som celestiall Transe: That (purg'd from passion) thy Divine address May guide me through Heav'ns glistring Palaces; Where (happily) my dear Vrania's grace, And her fair Sisters I may all imbrace: And (he melodious Sirens of the Sphears, Charming my senses in those sweets of theirs) So ravished, I may at rest contemple The Starry Arches of thy stately Temple: Vnto this end, that as (at first) from thee Our Grand-sires learn'd Heav'ns Course and Quality; Thou now mai'st prompt me som more lofty Song, As to this lofty Subiect doth belong. After That Mens strife-hatching, haut Ambition The occasion &amp; ground of this Discourse. Had (as by lot) made this lowe Worlds partition; Phalec and Heber, as they wandred, fand A huge high Pillar, which vpright did stand (Much like a Rock amid the Ocean set, Seeming great Neptunes surly pride to threat; Whereon a Pharos bears a Lanthorn bright, To save from Shipwrack those that sail by night) And afterward, another nigh as great; But not so strong, so stately, nor so neat: For, on the flowry field it lay all flat, Built but of Brick, of rusty Tiles, and Slat: Whereas the First was builded fair and strong Of Iasper smooth, and Marble lasting long. What Miracles! what monstrous heaps! what Hills Phalecs Question. Heav'd-vp my hand! what Types of antike Skills In form-less Forms (quoth Phalec)! Father showe (For, th'Ages past I knowe full well you knowe): Pray teach me, who did both these Works erect: About what time: and then to what effect. Old Seth (saith Heber) Adams Scholler yerst Hebers answer. (Who was the Scholler of his Maker first) Having attain'd to knowe the course and sites, Th'aspect and greatnes of Heav'ns glistring Lights; He taught his Children, whose industrious wit Through diligence grew excellent in it. For, while their flocks on flowry shoars they kept Of th'Eastern Floods, while others soundly slept (Hushing their cares in a Night-shortning nap, Vpon Oblivions dull and sense-less Lap) They, living lusty, thrice the age of Rav'ns, Observ'd the Twinkling Wonders of the Heav'ns: And on their Grand-sires firm and goodly ground A sumptuous building they in time do found. But (by Tradition Cabalistik) taught, That God would twice reduce this world to nought, By Flood and Flame; they reared cunningly This stately pair of Pillars which you see; Long-time safe-keeping, for their after-Kin, A hundred learned Mysteries therein. This having said, old Heber drawing nigher, The opening of the Pillars. Opens a Wicket in the Marble Spire, Where (Phalec following) soon perceive they might A pure Lamp burning with immortall light. Simile.As a mean person, who (though oft-disgraç't By churlish Porters) is convaied at last To the Kings Closet; rapt in deep amaze, At th'end-less Riches vp and down doth gaze: So Phalec fares. O father (cries he out) What shapes are these heer placed round about, So like each other wrought with equall skill, That foure rain-drops cannot more like distil? What Tools are these? what divine secrets ly Hidden within this learned Mystery? The liberall Sciences.These foure (quoth Heber) foure bright Virgins are, Heav'ns Babes, and Sisters, the most fair and rare, That e'r begot th'eternall Spirit (expir'd From double Spirit) or humane soule admir'd. Arithmetick.This first, that still her lips and fingers moves, And vp and down so sundry-waies removes Her nimble Crouns; th'industrious Art it is Which knowes to cast all Heav'ns bright Images, All Winters hail, and all the gawdy flowrs Wherewith gay Flora pranks this Globe of ours. She's stately deckt in a most rich Attire: All kinde of Coins in glistering heaps ly by-her: Vpon her sacred head Heav'n seems to drop A richer showr then fell in Danaes Lap: A gold-ground Robe; and for a Glass (to look) Down by her girdle hangs a Table-book, Wherein the chief of her rare Rules are writ, To be safe-guarded from times greedy bit. Her Numbers.Mark heer what Figure stands for One, the right 1.Root of all Number; and of Infinite: Loves happiness, the praise of Harmony, Nurcery of All, and end of Polymny: No Number, but more then a Number yet; Potentially in all, and all in it. 2.Now, note Two's Character, One's heir apparent, As his first-born; first Number, and the Parent 3.Of Female Pairs. Heer now obserue the Three, Th'eldest of Ods, Gods number properly; Wherein both Number, and no-number enter: Heav'ns dearest Number, whose enclosed Center Doth equally from both extreams extend: The first that hath beginning, midst and end. 4.The (Cubes-Base) Foure; a full and perfect summ, Whose added parts iust vnto Ten doo com; Number of Gods great Name, Seasons, Complexions, Windes, Elements, and Cardinall Perfections. 5.Th'Hermaphrodite Fiue, never multiply'd By't self, or Odd, but there is still descry'd His proper face: for, three times Fiue arriue Vnto Fifteen; Fiue Fiues to Twenty-fiue. The perfect Six, whose iust proportions gather, 6. To make his Whole, his members altogether: For Three's his halfe, his Sixt One, Two his Third; And One Two Three make Six, in One conferd. The Criticall and double-sexed Seav'n, 7. The Number of th'vnfixed Fires of Heav'n; And of th'eternall sacred Sabbaoth; Which Three and Foure containeth ioyntly both. Th'Eight, double-square. The sacred note of Nine, 8. 9. Which comprehends the Muses Triple-Trine. The Ten, which doth all Numbers force combine: The Ten, which makes, as One the Point, the Line: 10. The Figure, th'Hundred, Thousand (solid corps) Which, oft re-doubled, on th'Atlantik shoars 100. 1000. Can summ the sand, and all the drops distilling From weeping Auster, or the Ocean filling. See: many Summs, heer written streight and even Addition. Each over other, are in one contriven: See heer small Numbers drawn from greater count: Heer Multipli'd they infinitely mount: Subtraction. Multiplication. And lastly, see how (on the other side) One Summ in many doth it self Diuide. Diuision. That sallow-faç't, sad, stooping Nymph, whose ey Still on the ground is fixed stedfastly, Seeming to draw with point of siluer Wand Geometry. Som curious Circles in the slyding sand; Who weares a Mantle, brancht with flowrie Buds, Embost with Gold, trayled with silver Floods, Bordered with greenest Trees, and Fringed fine With richest azure of Seas storm-full brine: Whose dusky Buskins (old and tattered out) Showe, she hath trauail'd far and neer about By North and South, it is Geometrie, The Crafts-mans guide, Mother of Symmetrie, The life of Instruments of rare effect, Law of that Law which did the World erect. Heer's nothing heere, but Rules, Squires, Compasses, Her Instrum?ts and Figures. Waights, Measures, Plummets, Figures, Balances. Lo, where the Workman with a steddy hand Ingeniously a leuell Line hath drawn, War-like Triangles, building-fit Quadrangles, And hundred kindes of Forms of Manie-Angles Straight, Broad, and Sharp: Now see on th'other side Other, whose Tracts neuer directly slide, As with the Snayl, the crooked Serpenter, And that which most the learned do prefer, The compleat Circle; from whose every-place The Centre stands an equi-distant space. See heer the Solids, Cubes, Cylinders, Cones, Pyramides, Prismas, Dodechædrons: And there the Sphear, which (Worlds Type) comprehends In't-self it-self; hauing nor midst nor ends: Arts excellence, praise of his peers, a wonder Wherein consists (in diuers sort) a hundred: Firm Mobile, an vp-down-bending-Vault, Sloaping in Circuit, yet directly wrought. See, how so soon as it to veer begins, Both vp and down, forward and back it wends; And, rapt by other, not it self alone Moues, but moues others with its motion (Witnes the Heav'ns): yea, it doth seem, beside, When it stands still, to shake on every side, Because it hath but one small point where-on His equal halves are equi-peiz'd vpon, And yet this goodly Globe, where we assemble (Though hung in th'Ayr) doth neuer selfly tremble: For, it's the midst of the Con-centrik Orbs Whom neuer Angle nor out-nook disturbs. All Solids else (cast in the Ayr) reflect Vn-self-like-forms: but in a Globe each tract Seems still the same, because it euery-where Is vniform, and differs not a hair. More-over, as the Buildings Ambligon May more receiue then Mansions Oxigon (Because th'acute, and the rect-Angles too, Stride not so wide as obtuse Angles doo): So doth the Circle in his Circuit span More roum hen any other Fgure can. Th'other are eas'ly broke, because of ioynts, Ends and beginnings, edges, nooks, and points: But, th'Orb's not subiect vnto such distress, Because 'tis ioyntless, point-less, corner-less. Chiefly (my Phalec) hither bend thy minde, And learn Two Secrets which but fewe shall finde, Two busie knots, Two labyrinths of doubt, Where future Schools shall wander long about, Beating their brains, their best endeuours troubling: The Circles Squareness, and the Cubes Re-doubling. The certainty of Geometry.Print euer faster in thy faithfull brain, Then on brass leaues, these Problemes proued plain, Not by Sophistick subtle Arguments, But euen by practice and experience: Vn-disputable Art, and fruitfull Skill, Which with new wonders all the VVorld shall fill. Heer-by, the Waters of the lowest Fountains Her rare inventions. Shall play the Millers, as the Windes on Mountains: Mills. And grain, so ground within a rowling Frame, Shall pay his duty to his niggard Dame. Heer-by, a Bullet spewd from Brazen brest In fiery fume against a Town distrest, Gunnes. With roaring powr shall pash the Rocks in sunder, And with the noise euen drown the voice of Thunder. Heer-by the Wings of fauourable Windes Shall bear from Western to the Eastern Indes, Ships. From Africa to Tule's farthest Flood, A House (or rather a whole Town) of Wood; While sitting still, the Pilot shall at ease With a short Leauer guide it through the Seas. Heer-by, the Printer, in one day shall rid Printing. More Books, then yerst a thousand Writers did. Heer-by, a Crane shall steed in building, more The Crane. Then hundred Porters busie pains before: The Iacobs-staff, to measure heights, and Lands, Shall far excell a thousand nimble hands, The Staffe. To part the Earth in Zones and Climats even; And in twice-twenty-and-foure Figures, Heav'n. A Wand, Sand, Water, small Wheels turning ay, Dials and Clocks. In twice-twelue parts shall part the Night and Day. Statues of Wood shall speak: and fained Sphears Showe all the Wonders of true Heav'n in theirs. Sphears. Men, rashly mounting through the emptie Skie, With wanton wings shall cross the Seas wel-nigh: And (doubt-less) if the Geometrician finde Another world where (to his working minde) To place at pleasure and convenience His wondrous Engines and rare Instruments, Euen (like a little God) in time he may To som new place transport this World away. Because these Two our passage open set To bright Vrania's sacred Cabinet, Wherin shee keeps her sumptuous Furniture, Pearls, Diamonds, Rubies, and Saphires pure: Because, to climbe starrie Parnassus top None can, vnless these Two doo help him vp (For, whoso wants either of these Two eyes, In vain beholds Heav'ns glistering Canapies): The Caruer (heer) close by Geometry And Numbering Art, hath plaç't, Astronomy. Astronomy. A siluer Crescent wears she for a Crown, A hairy Comet to her heels hangs down, Brows stately bent in milde-Maiestik wise, Beneath the same two Carbuncles for eyes, An Azure Mantle wauing at her back, With two bright Clasps buckled about her neck; From her right shoulder sloaping ouer-thwart-her, A watchet Scarf, or broad imbrodered Garter, Flourisht with Beasts of sundry shapes, and each VVith glistering Stars imbost and poudred rich; And then, for wings, the golden plumes she wears Of that proud Bird which starry Rowells bears. Her 2. Globes.But what faire Globes (quoth Phalec) seemes she thus, With spreading arms, to reach and offer vs? 1. The Terrestriall.My Son (quoth Heber) that round Figure there, With crossing Circles, is the Mundane Sphear; Wherein, the Earth (as the most vile and base, And Lees of All) doth hold the lowest place: Whom prudent Nature girdeth ouer-thwart With azure Zone: or rather, euery part Couers with Water winding round about, Saue heer and there some Angles peeping out: For, th'Oceans liquid and sad slyding Waues Sinking in deepest of Earths hollow Caues, Seek not (within her vast vnequall height) The Centre of the wideness, but the weight. There, should be th'Ayr, the Fire, and wandring Seauen, The Firmament, and the first-mouing Heav'n (Besides th'Empyreall Palace of the Saincted) Each ouer other, if they could be painted. His 10 Circles.But th'Artist, faining in the steed of these, Ten Circles, like Heav'ns Superficies, To guide vs to them by more easie Path, In hollow Globe the same described hath. 1. The Equinoctiall.'Mid th'amplest Six, whose crossing difference Divides in two the Sphears Circumference, Stands th'Equinoctiall, equi-distant all From those two Poles which do support this Ball. Therefore each Star that vnderneath it slides, A rest-less, long, and weary Iourney rides, Goes larger Circuit, and more speedy far Then any other steady fixed Star (Which wexeth slowe the more it doth advaunce Neer either Pole his God-directed Daunce) And while Apollo driues his Load of Light Vnder this Line, the Day and dusky Night Tread equall steps: for, learned Natures hand Then measures them a-like in every Land. The next, which there beneath it sloaply slides, 2. The Zodiak.And his fair Hindges from the World's divides Twice twelue Degrees; is call'd the Zodiack, The Planets path, where Phœbus plies to make Th'Yeers Revolution: through new Houses ranging, To cause the Seasons yeerly foure-fold changing. Th'other, which (crossing th'Vniuersall Props, And those where Titans Whirling Chariot sloaps) 3. The 1. Colure. Rect-angles forms; and, crooking, cuts in two Heer Capricorn; there burning Cancer too; Of the Sun's stops it Colure hath to name, Because his Teem doth seem to trot more tame On these cut points: for, heere he doth not ride Flatling a-long, but vp the Sphears steep side. Th'other, which cuts this equi-distantly With Aries, Poles, and Scale, is (like-wisely) 4. The 2. Colure. The Second Colure: The Meridian, This 5. The Meridian. Which neuer in one Point of Heav'n persists; But still pursues our Zenith: as the light Inconstant Horizon our shifting sight. 6. The Horison. For the foure small ones: heer the Tropiks turn, Both that of Cancer and of Capricorn. 7 and 8 The Tropiks. And neerer th'Hindges of the golden Sphear, Heer's the South-Circle; the North-Circle there: Which Circles cross not (as you see) at all The Center-point of th'vniuersall Ball; 9 and 10 The South and North Circles. But, parting th'Orb into vn-equall ells, 'Twixt th'Equi-nox and them, rest Parallels. The other Ball her left hand doth support, Is Heav'ns bright Globe: for, though that Art com short The Celestiall Globes. Of Nature far, heer may ingenious soules Admire the stages of Star-seeled Poles. O what delight it is in turning soft The bright Abbridgement of that Vpper Loft, The diuers aspects of the celestiall Bodies. (To seem) to see Heav'ns glorious Host to march In glistring Troops about th'Aethereal Arch! Where, one for Arms bears Bowe and Shafts: a Sword A second hath; a trembling Launce a third: One fals: another in his Chariot rowles On th'azure Brass of th'ever-radiant Bowles: This serues a-foot, that (as a Horseman) rides: This vp, that down; this back, that forward slides: Their Order order-less, and Peace-full Braul With-child's the World; fils Sea, and Earth, and All. I neuer see their glaunces inter-iect Simile. In Triangle, Sextile, or Square aspect, Now milde, now moody; but, mee thinks I see Som frollik Swains amid their dauncing glee; Where Men and Maids together make them merry, With Iigs and Rounds, till Pipe and all be weary: Where, on his Loue one smiles with wanton eye; Where-at his Rivall frowns for Iealousie. Question.But why (quoth Phalec) hath th'All-Fair, who frames Nought heer below, but's full of Beauties flames; Ingrav'n on th'Orbs of th'azure Crystalline (Where Beauties self, and Loue should euer shine) So many hideous Beasts and Monsters fell: Fellows, more fit for th'vgly Fiends in Hell. Answere.Surely (saith Heber) God's all-prudent pleasure Makes nothing Art-less, nor without iust measure: And this the Worlds chiefe praise of Beauty carries That in each part it infinitly varies. The reason of the names giuen to the 12-Signes of the Zodiak.Our learned Elders then, who on this Sphear, Heav'ns shining Signes imagin'd fitly-fair, Did vnto each, such Shape and Name devise, As with their Natures neerly symbolize. 1. Aries.In form of Ram with golden Fleece, they put The bi-corn'd Signe, which the Yeers bounds doth 'butt; Because the World (vnder his temp'rate heat) In fleece of flowrs is pranked richly neat. 2. Taurus.Of Bull the next: because the husband-men With yoaks of slowe-paç't smoking Bullocks then Tear-vp their Fallows, and with hope-full toyl, Furbush their Coultars in the Corn-fit soyl. 3. Gemini.Of Twins the third: because then, of two Sexes Kinde-cruell Cupid one whole body mixes: Then all things couple, then Fruits double growe, Then Flowrs do flourish, and corn Fields do showe. 4. Cancer.The fourth a Lobstars name and frame they made, Because then South-ward Sol doth retrograde, Goes (Crab-like) backward, and so neuer stinteth, But still his wheels in the same track reprinteth. 5. Leo.The fift a Lion: for, as Lions breath Is burning hot; so likewise, vnderneath This fiery Signe, th'Earth sparkles, and the streams Seem sod-away with the Suns glowing beams. 6. Virgo.The sixt a Maid: because with Maid-like honour, Th'Earth loatheth then the Suns Loue-glances on her T'inflame her loue: and (reclus'd as it were) This Virgin Season nought at all doth bear. 7. Libra. Balance the seuenth: because it equall weighs Nights louing-silence, and grief-guiding Daies; And Heat and Cold: and in Must-Month, the Beam Stands equi-poiz'd in equipeizing them. 8. Scorpio. Scorpion the next: because his pearcing sting Doth the first tydings of cold Winter bring. 9. Sagittarius.The ninth an Archer both in shape and Name, Who day and night follows his fairest game; And his keen Arrows euery-where bestowes Headed with Yce, feathered with Sleet and Snowes. The next a Kid: because as Kids do clime 10. Capricornus. And frisk from Rock to Rock; about this Time The Prince of Planets (with the locks of Amber) Begins again vp towards vs to clamber. And then, because Heav'n alwayes seems to weep Vnder th'ensung Signes; on th'Azure steep Our Parents plaç't a Skinker: and by him, 11. Aquarius. Two siluer Fishes in his floods to swim. 12. Pisces. A deeper and more curious reason of the same. But if (my Son) this superficiall gloze Suffice thee not: then may we thus suppose, That as before th'All-working Word alone Made Nothing be All's womb and Embryon, Th'eternall Plot, th'Idea fore-conceiv'd, The wondrous Form of all that Form receiv'd, Did in the Work-mans spirit diuinely ly; And yer it was, the World was wondrously: Th'Eternall Trine-One, spreading even the Tent Of th'All enlightning glorious Firmament, Fill'd it with figures; and in various Marks There pourtray'd Tables of his future Works. See heer the pattern of a siluer Brook In heauen are patterns of all things that are in earth. Which in and out on th'azure stage doth crook, Heer th'Eagle plays, there flyes the rav'ning Crowe, Heer swims the Dolphin, there the Whale doth rowe, Heer bounds the Courser, there the Kid doth skip, Heer smoaks the Steer, the Dragon there doth creep: There's nothing precious in Sea, Earth, or Ayr, But hath in Heav'n som like resemblance fair. Yea, euen our Crowns, Darts, Lances, Skeyns, and Scales Are all but Copies of Heav'ns Principals; And sacred patterns, which to serue all Ages, Th'Almighty printed on Heav'ns ample stages. Yea surely, durst I (but why should I doubt A third witty pleasant, &amp; elegant reason of the names aforesaid. To wipe from Heav'n so many slanders out, Of profane Rapin and detested Rapes, Of Murder, Incest, and all monstrous Scapes, Wher-with (heerafter) som bold-fabling Greeks Shall foully stain Heav'ns Rosy-blushing cheeks?) Heer could I showe, that vnder euery Signe Th'Eternall grav'd som Mystery divine Of's holy Citty; where (as in a glass) To see what shall heer-after com-to pass; As publik and autentik Rowles, fore-quoting Confusedly th'Euents most worthy noting, In his deer Church (his Darling and Delight) O! thou fair Chariot flaming brauely bright, Plaustrum. Which like a Whirl-winde in thy swift Career Rapt'st vp the Thesbit; thou do'st alwaies veer About the North-pole, now no more be-dabbling Thy nimble spokes in th'Ocean, neither stabling Bootes.Thy smoking Coursers vnder th'Earth, to bayt: The while Elisha earnestly doth wayt Burning in zeale (ambitious) to inherit His Masters Office, and his mighty Spirit; That on the starry Mountain (after him) He well may manage his celestiall Teem. Hercules. Lyra. Corona Borealis. Vrsa minor. Pleiades. Cuspis.Close by him, Dauid in his valiant Fist Holds a fierce Lions fiery flaming Crest: Heer shines his golden Harp, and there his Crown: There th'vgly Bear bears (to his high renown) Seav'n (shining) Stars. Lo, heer the whistling Lance, Which frantick Saul at him doth fiercely glance. Pure Honours Honour, Prayse of Chastity, Andtomada. Cassiopeia. Cepheus.O fair Susanna, I should mourn for thee, And moan thy tears, and with thy friends lament (With Heav'n-lift-eyes) thy wofull punishment, Saue that so timely (through Heav'ns prouidence) Young Daniel saues thy wronged Innocence: Perseus.And by a dreadfull radiant splendor, spread Caput Medusæ.From Times Child Truth (not from Medusa's head) Condemns th'old Leachers, and eft-soons vpon Their cursed heads there hayls a storm of stone. Also, as long as Heav'ns swift Orb shall veer, A sacred Trophee shall be shining heer Draco.In the bright Dragon, of that Idoll fell, Which the same Prophet shall in Babel quel. Pegasus.Wher-to more fit may Pegasus compair, Than to those Coursers; flaming in the ayr, Before the Tyrant of less-Asia's fury Vsurps the fair Metropolis of Iury? Wher-to the Coach-man, but Ezechiel? That so well driues the Coach of Israel. Cygnus.Wher-to the Swan, but to that Proto-Martyr, The faithfull Deacon which endureth torture, (Yea death) for his dead Lord; whom sure to meet, So neer his end sings so exceeding sweet? Piscis Borealis.Wher-to the Fish which shineth heer so bright, But to that Fish, that cureth Tobies sight? Delphinus.Wher-to the Dolphin, but to that meek Man, Who dry-shod guides through Seas Erythrean Old Iacobs Fry: And Iordans liquid glass Makes all his Hoast dry (without boat) to pass? And furthermore, God hath not onely graven On the brass Tables of swift-turning Heav'n Trigonos.His sacred Mot; and, in Triangle frame, His Thrice-One Nature stamped on the same: But also, vnder that stout Serpent-Slayer, Ophiucus. His Satan-taming Son (Heav'ns glorious heir) Who with the Engin of his Cross abates Th'eternall Hindges of th'infernall Gates: And, vnder that fair Sun-fixt-gazing Foul, Aquila. The God of Gods deer Minion of his Soule, Which from his hand reaves Thunder often-times, His Spirit; his Loue, which visits earthly Climes In plumy shape: for, this bright winged Signe, In head and neck, and starry back (in fine) No less resembles the milde simple Doue, Than crook-bild Eagle that commands aboue. What shall I say of that bright Bandeleer, Which twice-six Signs so richly garnish heer? Th'Years Vsher, doth the Paschal Lamb fore-tell: The Bull, the Calfe, which erring Israel Aries. Sets vp in Horeb. These fair shining Twins, Taurus. Those striving Brethren Isaacs tender Sons: The fourth is Salomon, who (Crab-like) crawls Gemini. Cancer. Backward from Vertue: and (fowl Swine-like) fals In Vices mire: profanest old (at last) In soule and body growne a-like vn-chaste. The fift, that Lion which the Hair-strong Prince Leo. Tears as a Kid, without Wars instruments. The sixt, that Virgin, euer-maiden Mother, Virgo. Bearing for vs, her Father, Spouse, and Brother. The next that Beam, which in King Lemuels hand, So iustly weighs the Iustice of his Land. Libra. The next, that Creature which in Malta stings Th'Apostles hand, and yet no blemish brings; For 't is indifferent, whether we the same, Scorpio. A spotted Scorpion, or a Viper name. Th'Archer, is Hagars Son: The Goat (I ghess) Is Arons Scape-Goat in the Wildernes. Sagittarius. Capricornus. Aquarius. The next, the deer Son of dumb Zacharias, Gods Harbinger, fore-runner of Messias: Who in clear Iordan washeth clean the sin Of all that rightly do repent with-in. These Two bright Fishes, those wher-with the Lord Pisces. (Through wondrous blessing of his powrfull Word) Feeds with fiue Loaves (vpon Asphaltis shoar) Abundantly fiue thousand Folk and more. But, turn we now the twinkling Globe, and there Let's mark as much the Southern Hemi-sphear. Ah! know'st thou not this glorious Champion heer, Orion. Eridanus. Which shines so brightly by the burning Steer? 'Tis Nun's great Son, who through deep Iordan leads His Army dry shod; and (triumphant) treads Canis. Canicula. Lepus.On Canaan Curs, and on th'Ammorean Hare, Foyl'd with the fear of his victorious war. See th'ancient Ship, which, over windes and waues Triumphing safe, the Worlds seed-remnant saues. Hydra.Lo, heer the Brasen Serpent shines, whose sight Cures in the Desart those whom Serpents bite. Corvus.Heer th'happy Rav'n, that brings Eitas cates; Cratera.Heer the rich Cup, where Ioseph meditates His graue Predictions: Heer that Heav'nly Knight Centaurus., Who prest appearing armed all in white, To Maccabeus, with his flaming spear Lupus.So deep (at last) the Pagan Wolfe doth tear, Ara.That on Gods Altar (yerst profan'd so long) Sweet Incense fumeth, and the sacred Song Of Leuits soundeth in his House again; Corona austra.And that rich Crown th'Asmonean Race doth gain, To rule the Iewes. Lo, there the happy Fish Pisers australis.Which payes Christs Tribute (who our Ransom is): Balæna.And heer the Whale, within whose noysom breast, The Prophet Ionas for three daies doth rest. A notable correction of the Poet vpon these last Discourses.But while (my spoaks-man, or I rather his) Thus Heber comments on Heav'ns Images, Through path-less paths his wandring steps doth bring, And boldly quauers on a Maiden string; Suppose not (Christians) that I take for grounds Or points of Faith, all that he heer propounds; Or that old Zeno's Portall I sustain, Or Stoik Fate (th'Almighties hands to chain): Or in Heav'ns Volume reading things to-com, Erroneously a Chaldee-Wise becom, No, no such thing; but to refresh again Your tyred Spirits, I sung this novell strain: That hither to having with patience past Such dreadfull Oceans, and such Desarts vast, Such gloomy Forrests, craggy Rocks and steep, Wide-yawning Gulfs, and hideous Dungeons deep; You might (at last) meet with a place of pleasure, Wher-on the Heav'ns lauish their plentious treasure, Where Zephyre puffs perfumes, and siluer Brooks Embrace the Meads, smiling with wanton Looks. Yet (curteous Readers) who is it can say Whether our Nephews yet another-day (More zealous then our selues in things Divine) This curious Art shall Christianly refine; And giue, to all these glistring Figures then, Not Heathen names, but names of Holy men? He proceeds to discouer the secrets of Astronomie.But seek we now for Heber, whose Discourse Informs his Phalec in the Planets course: What Epicicle meaneth, and Con-centrik, With Apagé, Perigé, and Eccentrik: And how fell Mars (the Seedster of debate) Dayes glorious Torch, the wanton (Vulcans Mate) Saturn, and Ioue, three Sphears in one retain, Smooth Hermes five, faire Cynthia two-times-twain. For, the Divine Wits, whence this Art doth flowe, Finding their Fires to wander to and fro, Now neer, now far from Natures Nave: above, Confusion, voyd; and rupture to remoue, Which would be caused, through their wanderment, In th'Heav'ns inclos'd within the Firmament, Haue (more then men) presum'd to make, within Th'Eternall Wheels where th'erring Tapers been, Sundry small Wheels, each within other closed, Such equi-distance each-where inter-posed, That (though they kiss) they crush not; but the base Are vnder th'high, the high the lowe imbrace: Like as the Chest-nut (next the meat) within Simile. Is cover'd (last) with a soft slender skin, That skin inclos'd in a tough tawny shel, That shel in-cas't in a thick thistly fell. Then takes he th'Astrolabe, wher-in the Sphear Is flat reduced: he discouers there The vse of the Astrolabe. The Card of Heights, the Almycantharats, With th'Azimynths and the Almadarats (Pardon me Muse, if ruder phrase defile This fairest Table, and deface my stile With Barbarism: For in this Argument, To speak Barbarian, is most eloquent). On th'other side, vnder a veering Sight, A Table veers; which, of each wandring Light Showes the swift course; and certain Rules includes, Dayes, names of Months, and scale of Altitudes. Removing th'Albidade, he spends som leasure, To shew the manner how a Wall to measure, A Fountains depth, the distance of a place, A Countries compass, by Heav'ns ample face: In what bright starry Signe, th'Almighty dread, Dayes Princely Planet daily billeted: In which his Nadir is: and how with-all To finde his Eleuation and his Fall. How long a time an entire Signe must wear While it ascendeth on our Hemi-sphear: Poles eleuation: The Meridian line: And diuers Hours of Day and night to finde. These learned wonders witty Phalec marks, And heedfully to euery Rule he harks: Wise Alchymist, he multiplies this Gold, This Talent turns, encreasing many-fold: And then presents it to his Noble seed, Who soon their Doctor in his Art exceed. Simile.But, even as Mars, Hermes, and Venus bright, Go visit now the naked Troglodite, Then Iaue, then Guynney; and (inclin'd to change) Oft shifting House, through both the Worlds do range Astronomy by whom, and how maintained.(Both Worlds ev'n-halv'd by th'Equinoctiall Line): So the perfection of this Art divine, First vnder th'Hebrews bred and born, anon Coms to the Chaldes by adoption: Scorning, anon, th'olde Babylonian Spires, It leaues swift Tigris, and to Nile retires; And, waxen rich, in Egypt it erects A famous School: yet, firm-less in affects, It falls in loue with subtill Grecian wits, And to their hands a while it self commits; But, in renowned Ptolomeus Raign, It doth re-visit the deer Memphian Plain: Yet, Thence re-fled, it doth th'Arabians try; From thence to Rome: from Rome to Germany. O true Endymions, that imbrace above Vpon mount Latmos your Imperiall Love The prayse of learned Astronomers, and the profite of their Doctrine.(Great Queen of Heav'n) about whose Bed, for Guard, Millions of Archers with gold Shields do ward. True Atlasses: You Pillars of the Poles Empyreall Palace; you fair learned soules; But for your Writings, the Starrs-Doctrine soon Would sink in Læthe of Oblivion: 'Tis you that Marshall Months, and yeers, and dayes: 'Tis you that quote for such as haunt the Seas Their prosperous Dayes, and Dayes when Death ingraven On th'angry Welkin, warns them heep their Haven: 'Tis you that teach the Plough-man when to sowe: When the brave Captain to the Field shall goe; When to retire to Garrison again; When to assault a batter'd Peece; and when To conuoy Victuals to his valiant Hoast: 'Tis you that shewe what season fitteth most For euery purpose; when to Purge is good, When to be Bathed, when to be Let-blood: And how Physicians, skilfully to mix Their Drugs, on Heav'n their curious eys must fix. 'Tis you that in the twinkling of an ey Through all the Heav'nly Prouinces do fly: 'Tis you that (greater then our greatest Kings) Possess the whole World in your Governings: And (to conclude) you Demi-gods can make. Between your hands the Heav'ns to turn and shake. O divine Spirits: for you my smoothest quill His sweetest hony on this Book should still; Still should you be my Theam: but that the Beauty Of the last Sister drawes my Love and Duty; For, now I hear my Phalec humbly crave The fourth Maids name: his Father, mildely-grave, Replyes him thus; Observe (my dearest Son) Those cloud-less brows, those cheeks vermilion, Those pleasing looks, those eyes so smiling-sweet, The description of Musick. That grace-full posture, and those pretty feet Which seem still Dancing: all those Harps and Lutes, Shawms, Sag-buts, Citrons, Viols, Cornets, Flutes, Plaç't round about her; prove in every part This is the noble, sweet, Voice-ord'ring Art, Breath's Measurer, the Guide of supplest fingers On (living-dumb, dead-speaking) sinew-singers: Th'Accord of Discords: sacred Harmony, And Numb'ry Law, which did accompany Th'Almighty-most, when first his Ordinance Appointed Earth to rest, and Heav'n to dance. For (as they say) for super-Intendent there, The Heavens Harmony. The supream Voice placed in every Sphear A Siren sweet; that from Heav'ns Harmony Inferiour things might learn best Melody, And their rare Quier with th'Angels Quier accord To sing aloud the praises of the Lord, In 's Royall Chappell, richly beautifi'd With glist'ring Tapers and all sacred Pride. Where, as (by Art) one selfly blast breath'd out Simile. From panting bellows, passeth all-about Winde-Instruments; enters by th'vnder Clavers Which with the Keys the Organ-Master quavers, Fils all the Bulk, and severally the same Mounts every Pipe of the melodious Frame; At once reviving lofty Cymbals voice, Flutes sweetest air, and Regals shrillest noise: Even so th'all-quickning Spirit of God above The Heav'ns harmonious whirling wheels doth move; So that re-treading their eternall trace, Th'one bears the Trebble, th'other bears the Base. But, brimmer far than in the Heav'ns, heer A fourefold Consort in the humors, seasons and elements. All these sweet-charming Counter-Tunes we hear: For, Melancholy, Winter, Earth belowe, Bear ay the Base; deep, hollow, sad and slowe: Pale Phlegm, moist Autumn, Water moistly-cold, The Plummet-like-smooth-sliding Tenor hold: Hot-humid Bloud, the Spring, transparent Air; The Maze-like Mean, that turns and wends so fair: Curst Choler, Sommer, and hot thirsty Fire, Th'high warbling Treble, loudest in the Quire. The power of Musik towards all things.And that's the cause (my Son) why stubborn'st things Are stoopt by Musik; as reteining springs Of Number in them: and they feeble live But by that Spirit which th'Heav'ns dance doth drive. Towards Men.Sweet Musik makes the sternest men-at-Arms Let-fall at once their Anger and their Arms: It cheers sad soules, and charms the frantik fits Of Lunatiks that are bereft their wits: It kils the flame, and curbs the fond desire Of him that burns in Beauties blazing Fire (Whose soule, seduced by his erring eies, Doth som proud Dame devoutly Idolize): Towards Beasts, Birds, Flies and Fishes.It cureth Serpents banefull bit, whose anguish In deadly torment makes men madly languish: The Swan is rapt, the Hinde deceiv'd with-all, And Birds beguil'd with a melodious call: Th'Harp leads the Dolphin, and the buzzing swarm Of busie Bees the tinkling Brass doth charm. O! what is it that Musick cannot doo! Towards God. himself.Sith th'all-inspiring Spirit it conquers too: And makes the same down from th'Empyreall Pole Descend to Earth into a Prophets soule; With divine accents tuning rarely right Vnto the rapting Spirit the rapted Spright. Sith, when the Lord (most moved) threatneth most, With wrathfull tempest arming all his Hoast; When angry stretching his strong sinewy arms, With bended back he throwes down thundry storms; Th'harmonious sighs of his heart-turning Sheep Supple his sinews, lull his wrath a-sleep; While milde-ey'd Mercy stealeth from his hand The sulph'ry Plagues prepar'd for sinfull Man. Conclusion of the 2. Day of the 2. Week.But, while that Heber (eloquently) would Old Musiks vse and excellence have told; Curst Canaan (seeking Iordans fatall course) Past by the Pillars, and brake his Discourse, And mine withall; for I must rest me heer: My weary Iourny makes me faint well-neer: Needs must I crave new aid from High, and step A little back, that I may farther leap. The End of the Second Day of the Second Week. ABRAHAM. THE THIRD DAY OF THE SECOND WEEK. CONTAINING I. The Vocation, II. The Fathers, III. The Lawe, IV. The Captains The Vocation. THE FIRST PART OF THE THIRD DAY OF THE II WEEK. The Argvment. Abram from Chaldè is Divinely Call'd: How Blest abroad: His (parted) Nephew Thrall'd (In Sodom's aid) to Chedorlaomer; Rescu'd by Him: Type of that bloudy War: Melchisedec His Hap congratulates: Ismael great; but God confederates With (promis'd) Isaak, and his (Christ-kin) Seed, Which shall in number even the Stars exceed: Lot harbors Angels; sav'd from Sodom's Fire; His Wife Transform'd: His Daughters foul Desire. Vntill this Day (deer Muse) on every side Within straight lists thou hast been boundifi'd, Pend in a Path so narrow every-where, Thou couldst not manage: only heer and there (Reaching thine arms over the Rails that close Thy bounded Race) thou caught'st from fragrant Rose, Som Iuly-flowr, or som sweet Sops-in-Wine, To make a Chaplet, thy chaste brows to binde. But now, behold th'art in the open Plain, Simile.Where thou maist liuely, like the Horse of Spain (That having burst his halter and his holde Flings through the field, where list him, vncontrol'd) Corvet, and turn, run, prance, advance, and pride-thee, As sacred fury of thy Zeal shall guide-thee. Th'whole World is thine: henceforth thy Sythe may mowe The fairest Crop that in Fame's fields doth growe; And, on the Sea of richest Histories Hulling at large, a hundred Victories, A hundred Rowts, a hundred Wonders new Com huddling in, in heaps before thy view: So that I fear, lest (train'd with various sent) Thou be at fault in this vast Argument; And lest the best choice in so bound-less Store Pain thee no less now, than did Want before. But worst thou what, my Muse (my dear delight, My care, my comfort)? we will follow right Simile. The modest hand of a fair Shepherdling, Who doth not rudely spoil the flowry Spring Of all her painted beauties; nor deface All in one day a pleasant Gardens grace; But mannerly amid the Quarters seeks Such rarest flowrs as best her fancy likes: And heer a blew one, there a red she pulls, A yellow heer, and there a white she culls, Then bindes them with her hair, and blessed over With a chaste kiss, she sends them to her Lover: We'l over-run the Annals of all Ages; And, choosing-out the chiefest Personages, And Prodigies amid the Hebrew Story, We'l offer them on th'Altar of Gods glory. For He (I hope) who, no less good then wise, First stirr'd vs vp to this great Enterprise, And gave vs heart to take the same in hand, For Level, Compass, Rule and Squire will stand; Will change the Pebbles of our puddly thought To Orient Pearls, most bright and bravely wrought; And will not suffer in this pretious Frame Ought that a skilfull Builders ey may blame: Or, if he suffer ought, 't shall be som trace But of that blindnes common to our Race; T'abate my glory, and to give me proof, That (mortall) I build but with mortall stuff. Iames, richest Gem of Scots, and Scotlands Praise, Dedication to the Kings Maiesty. Who, with the same hand that the Scepter swaies, On Heav'n-faln paper, in a golden stile, Doost happily immortall lines compile; And (new Apollo) vnder Others names Singst in thy Childehood thine Own future Fames: To whom but Thee should I these Verses vow? Who through the World hast made me famous now, And with a liberall learned hand indu'd My Muse with lustre of a Royall Sute; Before, so ragged, that she blusht wel-neer That her chaste Sisters should so homely see-her, The scorn of Art, of Helicon the shame, Vsurping (wrong) Vrania's sacred Name. Through thee she's Heav'nly. O wise, worthy Prince, Maist thou surmount all those in Excellence, Which have (before thee) Rul'd th'hard-ruled Scots, And ruder Picts (painted with Martiall spots) That, first Fergusius (glory of his daies) Ev'nus and Donald may envy thy Praise; And even the Scott'sh (or rather th'Hebrew) David (Iesses great Son, so holily behaved) Give place to thy Renown, and therwithall Give thee his Zeal and Heart heroïcall, And all his best (which doth thee best belong) As he hath giv'n thee his sweet Harp and Song. Thovgh profane service of Idolatry Had drown'd the whole Earth vniversally: Though shame-less sin (born with the Colonies Through all the world) through all did Tyrannize: Yet in Chaldea was their chiefest Seat, Their strength in Shinaar; and that City great, Built on the slimy strand of Euphrates, Was the proud Palace where they held their Feasts. So that, even Sem's and Heber's sacred Line (Where God his grace yet seemed to confine) Sucking the Sin-bane of Assyrian air, Did (like the Heathen) every day impair; Forgot the true God, followed (rashly-rude) The gross grand Error of the multitude; Degeneriz'd, decaid and withered quight: Simile.Like som rare Fruit-Tree over-topt with spight Of Briers and Bushes which it sore oppress, With the sowr shadow of their thorny tress, Till choakt withall, it dies as they do growe, And beareth nought but Moss and Misseltoe. The calling of Abraham.But God, desirous (more for vs, then him) In som one stock to save Faith's sacred stem (Like as before from the All-drowning Flood He sav'd the worlds seed in an Ark of wood) Marks Abram for his own: and from false Rites To Men, to Beasts, to Stocks, to Stones, to Sprites, Him gratiously to his own Service drawes; Not by meer Conduct of exteriour cause, As by contempling th'Artship richly-rare Which gilds the Seeling of this Globe so fair; Earths fruitfull powr, producing (goodly-green) From so small seeds so huge and mighty Treen, Flowrs fragrant air, so fresh and divers-died; Seas foaming Course, whose ever-Tilting Tide (Ebbing or flowing) is confin'd to Season, Bounded with lists, guided with reans of Reason: But, by the motion of his Spirit, which seals In our hearts Centre what his word reveals, And prudently in his fit time and place (Dispensing frankly his free gifts of Grace) Doth inwardly bear-witnes, and aver-it Vnder our Spirits that 't is Gods Holy Spirit. The sacred Faith of Abram languisht not The fruits of a true faith &amp; the effect therof. In idleness, but alwaies waakt and wrought, And ever lively, brought forth Patience, Humility, Hope, Bounty, Innocence, Loue, feruent Zeal, Repentance, Temperance, Sincerity, and true Perseuerance; Fruits that (like Load-stones) haue a vertue giuen (Through Faith) to draw their Father-Tree to Heav'n, And guide the soules to God (the spring of life) Of's kins-man Lot, and Sara his deer Wife; Who with him following the Almighti's call, Wend to the strand where Iordans course doth craul, Their owne deer Country willingly forsake, And (true-religious) less account do make Of goods and lands, and quiet-lifes content, Than of an end-less, friendless Banishment. O sacred ground of Vertue's sole perfection! O shield of Martyrs! Prophets sure direction! Soule's remedy! O contrite heart's Restorer! Tears-wiping tame-grief! Hopes guide, hunting horror, Path of Saluation! Pledge of Immortality! O liuely Faith! through thy admired quality, How many wonders dost thou work at once, When from Sin's slumbers thou hast waakt vs once, And made vs inly in our spirits conceiue Beauties that neuer outward eyes perceiue! Alas! said Abram, must I needs forgoe These happy fields where Euphrates doth flowe? Natural considerations to haue stopt the Journey of Abraham. Heer, first I drew this vitall air, and (pleas'd With my births news) my Mothers throes I eas'd: Heer, from her tender brest (as soft as silk) My tender gums suckt my first drop of milk: Heer, with the pleasure of mine infant-smile Her Cares and Cumbers I did oft beguile: Heer, my chaste Sisters, Vncles, Aunts and Kin, My pritty prattling have delighted in: Heer, many a time I wantonly have clung, And on my fathers wrinkled neck have hung: Heer, I have past my Lad-age fair and good: Heer, first the soft Down on my chin did bud: Heer, I have learn'd Heav'ns Motions, and the nature And various force of Fire, Air, Earth and Water: Heer, I haue show'n the noblest tokens forth Both of my Mindes and of my Bodies worth: Heer, I have spent the best part of mine age: Heer, I possess a plentious Heritage: Heer, I have got me many friends and fame, And by my Deeds attain'd a glorious Name: And must I hence, and leaue this certain state, To roam vncertain (like a Runagate) O're fearfull Hils, and thorough foaming Torrents That rush-down Mountains with their roaring Currents, In dreadfull Desarts, where Heav'ns hottest beam Shall burn without; within vs, Thirst extream: And gloomy Forrests full of ghastly fear Of yelling Monsters that are dwelling there? To seek a Country (God knowes where, and whither) Whose vnknowen name hath yet scarce sounded hither? With staff in hand, and wallet at our back, From Town to Town to beg for all we lack? To guise our selves (like counterfaiting Ape) To th'guise of Men that are but Men in shape? T'have (briefly) nothing properly our own In all the World; no, not our Grave-place knowen? Is 't possible, I should endure to see The sighs and tears my friends will shed for me? O! can I thus my Native soil forsake? O! with what words shall I my Farewell take? Farewell Chaldea: dear delights, adieu: Friends, Brothers, Sisters, farewell all of you, Farewell for ever: Can I thus (alas!) Rudely vnwinde me from the kinde embrace Of their dear arms, that will me faster hould 2. Comparisons.Than trembling Ivie doth the Oakenfould; Or than the Vine doth with her crawling spray The boughs of Elm, her limber limbs to stay? Can I expose (with perill of my life) Th'vn-vulgar beauties of my vertuous wife, To the none-sparing lust of that loose Nation That brutely burns in all abomination? Besides, what rigour? nay, what paricide? To hale from Tigris shoar to Iordans side A weak old-man? a man so weak and ould, He scarce can creep without our help and hould. His resolution aboue all discourse of reason.Yet, 't must be so: for so the Lord commands. A carnall man on carnall reason stands: But, for all Reasons, Faith suffizeth me. Who lodge with God can never House-less be. Then cheerly marcht he on, and though the age And death of Terah slow'd his pilgrimage; The rest of His he doth conduct (in fine) To Canaan (since called Palæstine): Where God pours down such flouds of goods vpon them, The great blessing of God on his obedience. And bountiously bestowes such blessings on them, That their abundance shortly seems t'exceed Gods Promises, and their desires indeed. Their fruitfull Heards, that hill and dale do haunt, Resemble not the breed of th'Elephant, Simile. Which (slowe in coupling, and in calving more, Pining her Master so long time before With lingring hope) brings-forth, with painfull groans, But once in twelve yeers, but one Calf at once. All's white with their wool: all their Cattell proves, Still, still increasing like to Stares and Doves. Their Wealth so growes, that, wantoniz'd withall, Iarre begun between his Seruants, and the Seruants of Lot. Their envious Shepheards broach a civil Brawl. But, lest this Mischief, by the Grooms begun, Between their Masters might vnkindly run, The grave-milde Grand-sire of the Faithfull (there) And Ammoa's Father, to cut-off the fear Of farther strife, and to establish rather Their Mindes, then Bodies, in a league together; Divided duly with a deep foresight Their Flocks and Heards in number infinite. Then pleas'd and parted; both go live a-part: Abram &amp; Lot to shun centention, part company. The Vncle kept the Mountain for his part; For,'s Nephew chose the fat and flowry Plain, And even to Sodom stretcht his Tent and Train; And, dwelling there, becam a Citizen Among those monstrous, Nature-forcing Men. O Lot (alas!) what lot hast thou elect? Lot dwels at Sodom. Th'eternall verdure, and the trim prospect, The plentious Pastures, and the purling Springs, Whose fibrous silver thousand Tributes brings To wealthy Iordan, watering so the soil (Like Gods own Garden) doth thy sense beguile, Blindeth thy iudgement, makes thee (miserable) To seat thee with a People execrable, Whose War-thrall'd woes, and odious villanies To springs of tears shall turn thy tender eyes. Elam's proud King, great Chedor-Laomer The battaile of Siddim fought by the king of Elam, with his confederates, against the Kings of Sodom and Gommorrha with heirs. (Leagued with Arioch King of Ellazar, The Soverain of the Nations, Thadael, And with the King of Shynaar, Amraphel) Made war against the Kings of Sodoma, Gomorrha, Zeboim, Zoar, Adamah; Who, subiect to him for twelve yeers before, Rebelled now, and cast the yoak they bore. Both Camps approach, their bloudy rage doth rise, And even the face of Cowards terriblize; New Martiall heat inflames their mindes with ire, Their bloud is moov'd, their heart is all on fire. Their cheerfull limbs (seeming to march too slowe) Longing to meet, the fatall drums out-go; And even already in their gesture fight: Th'iron-footed Coursers, lusty, fresh and light, Marrying their Masters cause and courage both, Snowe all the field with a white foaming froth, And prancing with their load (as proud withall) With loud-proud neighings for the Combat call. Now both the Hoasts march forward furiously, The Plain between soon shrinketh equally: First in the Air begins a fight of dust, Then on the Earth both Armies bravely ioust. Brave yet it was: for yet one might behould Bright swords and shields, and plumed helms of gould Vn-goard with bloud; no Cask had lost his head, No Horse his load, no scattered Corps lay dead. But, on our Corn-fields towards harvest-time Comparison.(For punishment of som ingratefull crime) Th'incensed hand of Heav'ns Almighty King Never more thick doth slippery Ice-pearls fling, Than heer the Arrows showr on euery side: An iron Cloud Heav'ns angry face doth hide From Souldiers sight; and flying weapons then For lack of ground fall vpon horse or men: Ther's not a shaft but hath a man for White, Nor stone but lightly in warm bloud doth light: Or, if that any fail their foes to hit In fall; in flight themselves they enter-split: The wounds com all from Heav'n: the bravest Hee Kils and is kild of him he doth not see: Without an aim the Dart-man darts his spear, And Chance performs th'effect of Valour there. Simile.As two stout Rams, both Ieloux-phrenzy-sick, Afront two flocks, spurd on with anger's prick, Rush-on each other with tempestuous shock, And, butting boisterous, horns and heads do knock: So, these two Armies enterchanged blowes; And doubling steps and strokes vpon their Foes, First flesh their Lances and their Pikes embrew, Then with their swords about them keenly heaw, Then stab with daggers; standing bravely to-'t, Till Foe to Foe they charge them foot to foot; So neer, that oft ones Targets pike doth pearce Anothers Shield, and sends him to his Herse. And gawdy plumes of Foes (be-Cedered brave) Oft on their Foes (vn-plumed) crests do wave. Of all their stroaks scarce any stroak is vain; Yet stand they firm, and still the fight maintain: Still fronting Death, they face to face abide, None turn their backs; no, neither shrink aside; Of their own blood, as of their Foe's, as frank. But, too-too tired, som at last dis-rank: Then, Threats and Cries, and Plaints, redoubled ay, And so pel-mel rage-blinded Mars doth play, That now no more their Colours they discern; But, knowing none, to all are strangely stern. The Palestine fights vnder Elams Standard, The Shinarite with Sodoms Ensignes wander'd: Even as two swarms of busie Buzzers, mounting Simile. Amid the Air, and mutually affronting, Mingle their Troops; one goes, another coms, At other turns; a cloud of Moatlings hums Above our heads, who with their cipres wings Decide the Quarell of their little Kings: Either of which a hundred times a minute Doth lose a Souldier, and as oft re-win-it. But, may one hope in Champions of the Chamber, A martial brave of an olde Captain against the effeminate softnes and delicacy of Carpet-Knights. Soft Carpet-Knights, all senting Musk and Amber (Whose chief delight is to be over-com) Vn-danted hearts that dare not Over-com? In Woman-Men a manly Constancy? In wanton Arms vn-wearied Valiancy? No, no (Gomorrah) this is not the place For quav'ring Lutes a warbling Voice to grace: No (filthy Sodom) 't is not heer the game To play with Males in spight of Natures name: No (Zeboim) heer are no Looking-Glasses For Para-Nymphs to gaze their painted faces: To starch Mustachoes, and to prank in print, And curl the Lock (with fauours braided in 't): No (Adamah) we spend not heer the day In Dancing, Courting, Banquetting and Play: Nor lastly (Zoar) is it heer the guise Of silken Mock-Mars (for a Mistress-Prize) With Reed-like Lance, and with a blunted Blade, To Championize vnder a Tented shade, As at your Tourneys. Therefore to your Mew: Lay down your weapons, heer's no Work for you. 'Tis heer the Fashion (and the pride of Wars) To paint the face with sweat, dust, blood and scars: Our Glass is heer a bright and glist'ring shield: Our Satten, steel: the Musick of the Field Doth rattle like the Thunders dreadfull roar: Death tilteth heer: the Mistress we adore, Is Victory (true Soverain of our hearts) Who without danger graceth no Deserts: Dead carcasses perfume our dainty Nose: Our Banquets heer, be Banquets for the Crowes: Flee therefore (Cowards) flee and turn your backs, (As you were wont in your thought-shaming acts) But with our swords and Lances (in your haste) Through-thrilled (Villains) this shall be your last, Said Amraphel: and charg'd them in such sort, That 't seems a sudden Whirl-winde doth transport Defeature of the Sodomites.Their fainting Troops. Som (best-advised) fly To tops of Mountains that do neighbour by; Som, through the Plain: but, neither (in the chace) Dares once look back (no, not with half a face) Their fear had no restraint, and much less Art: This throwes away his shield, and that his dart; Swords, Morrions, Pouldrons, Vaunt-brace, Pikes &amp; Lances, Are no defence, but rather hinderances: They with their hearts, have also lost their sight, And recking less a glorious end, in Fight, Than thousand base deaths, desperatly they ran Into the flood that fats rich Canaan. Then, Iordan arms him 'gainst these infidels, With rapid course, and like a sea he swels; Lakes vnder ground into his chanel range, And shallowest Foords to ground-less gulfs do change: He fumes, he foams; and, swiftly whirling round, Seems, in his rage, these bitter words to sound: Dy (Villains) dy: O more then infamous Foul Monsters! drench your damned soules in vs. Sa, sa, my Floods: with your cold moisture quench The lust-full flame of their self burning stench. Drown, drown the Hel-hounds, and revenge the wrong Which they have don our Mother Nature long. The River, swiftly whirling-in the slaves, Above with Boaws, beneath with Bodies paves: The gaudy Plume, yet floating light and soft, Keeps for awhile the hollow helm aloft; But yet (at length) even those that swim the best, Down to the bottom sink among the rest, Striving and struggling (topsi-turuy tost). While fain they would, but cannot, yield the ghost, Because the flood (vnwilling to defile His purest waves with spirits so foul and vile) Re-spews them still into themselues, and there Smoothers, and choaks, and rams them, as it were: Then both at once (Bodies and Soules) at last To the main Sea, or his own shoar doth cast. The Kings of Sodom and Gomorrah then, Their own Ambush serues against themselues. Hoping to train the King of Elams men, Among the Clay-pits which themselues before (T'intrap the Foe) with boughs had covered o're, Ran thither-ward: but their confused flight, In their owne ambush made their owne to light: Wherein they lost the flowr of all their rest, Sooner of death, then of deaths fear possest. One, as he flies with trembling steps the dart Which (from behinde) nigh pearst him to the heart, Tangling his foot with twyning tendrels tho Of a wilde Vine that neer a pit did growe, Stumbles, and tumbles in, hung by the heels Vp to the wast in water: where he feels A three-fold Fate: for there (O strange!) he found Three deaths in one; at once slain, hangd and drownd. Another, weening o'r a Well to skip, From the wet brim his hap-less foot doth slip, And in he fals: but instantly (past hope) He catcheth holde vpon a dangling rope, And so at length with shifting hands gets-vp By little and litle to the fountains top. Which Thadael spying, to him straight he hies, And thus alowd vnto the wretch he cries; Varlet, is this, is this the means you make, Your wonted yoak of Elam off to shake? Is this your Skirmish? and are these your blowes, Wher-with t'incounter so courageous Foes? Sir, leaue your ladder; this shall serue as well, This sword shall be your ladder down to Hell: Go pay to Pluto (Prince of Acheron) The Tribute heer deny'd vnto your own: Heer-with he draws his Fauchin bright and keen, And at a blowe heaws both his arms off clean: His trickling hands held fast, down fell his Trunk, His blood did swim, his body quickly sunk. Another (roughly pushed by the Foe) Fals headlong down into a Bog belowe: Where, on his head deep planted in the mud With his heels vp-ward, like a tree he stood; Still to and fro, wauing his legs and arms, Simile. As Trees are wont to waue in windy storms. Another heer (on hors-back) posting over A broad, deep clay-pit that green boughs do cover, Sinks instantly; and in his sudden Fate Seems the bave Horse doubly vnfortunate: For, his own neck he breaks, and bruzing in (With the keen scales of his bright Brigandin) His Masters bowels, serves (alas!) for Tomb To him that yerst so many times did comb His crispy Crest, and him so frankly fed Simile.In 's hollow Shield with oats and beans and bread: Even so somtimes, the loving Vine and Elm (With double domage) ioyntly over-whelm; She wails the wrack of her deer Husbands glade; He moanes his Spouses feeble arms and shade: But most it grieves him with his Trunk to crush The precious Clusters of her pleasing Bush; And press to death vnkindly with his waight Her that for loue embraceth him so straight. Lots valour.Yet Lot alone (with a small troup assisted) The Martiall brunt with Manly breast resisted, And thirsting Fame, stands firmly looking for The furious hoste of Chedorlaomer: But as a narrow and thin-planted Cops Of tender saplings with their slender tops, Is fell'd almost as soon as vnder-taken By Multitudes of Peasants Winter-shaken: Lot's little Number so environ'd round, Hemm'd with so many swords, is soon hew'n down. His vndanted resolution.Then left alone, yet still all one he fares; And the more danger, still the more he dares: Simile.Like a strange Mastiff fiercely set vpon By mongrell Curs, in number ten to one: Who tyr'd with running (growen more cunning) gets Into som corner, where vpright he sits Vpon his stern, and sternly to his foes His rage-full, foaming, grinning teeth he showes, And snarles, and snaps; and this and that doth bite, And stoutly still maintains th'vnequall fight With equall fury, till (disdaining Death) His Enemies be beaten out of breath. Arioch, admiring, and (even) fearing too What Lot had done, and what he yet might doo; Him princely meets, and mildly greets him thus: Cease (valiant youth) cease, cease t'incounter vs. Wilt thou (alas!) wilt thou (poor soule) expose And hazard thus thy life and Fame to lose, In such a Quarrell, for the cause of such? Alas, I pitty thy misfortune much. For, well I see, thy habit and thy tongue Thine Arms (but most) thy courage (yet so yong) Shewe that in Sodom's wanton wals accurst Thou wert not born, nor in Gomorrha nurst. O chief of Chivalry, reserue thy worth For better wars: yeeld thee: and think hence-forth I highly prize thy powrs; and, by my sword, For thousand kingdoms will not false my word. Past hope of Conquest (as past fear of death) Lot taken prisoner. Lot yeelds him then vpon the Princes Faith; And, from his Camell quick-dismounting, hies His Royall hand to kiss in humble wise: And th'Army, laden with the richest spoyl, Triumphantly to th'Eastward marcht the while. No sooner noyse of these sad novels cam Vnto the ears of faithfull Abraham, Abraham with his family of 300. goes to rescue Lot. But instantly he arms to rescue Lot, And that rich prey the heathen Kings had got. Three hundred servants of his house he brings (But lightly arm'd with staves and darts, and slings Aided by Mamre (in whose Plain he wons) Ascol and Aner (Amor's valiant sons) So at the heels he hunts the fear-less Foe, Yet waits advantage yer he offer blowe) Favour'd by streightness of the wayes they took, And cover'd close with nights deceitfull cloak. In Groon-land fields is found a dungeon, A liuely description of Sleep, with his Cell, Seruants, furniture and company. A thousand-fold more dark then Acheron, It hath no door, lest as it turns about On rusty hooks, it creak too lowdly out, But Silence serves for Port and Porter there, A gagged Vsher that doth never wear Stif-rustling silks, nor rattling chamlet sutes, Nor gingling spurs, nor creaking spanish boots; But, that he make no noyse (when ere he sturs) His high-day sutes are of the softest Furs, At other times (less-stately-service-full) Hee's only clad in cotton, shod in wool: His left fore-finger ore his lips he locks; With th'other beckens to the early Cocks, The rushing streams, and roaring Eölus, Seeming (though dumb) to whisper softly thus: Sleep silver Torrents; cease, sweet Chante-cleer, To bid Good-morrow to the Morning heer: Be still, ye Windes, keep in your native nest; Let not your storms disturb this house of Rest. In midst of all this Caue so dark and deep, On a still-rocking couch lies blear-ey'd Sleep, Snorting alowd, and with his panting breath Blowes a black fume, that all envapoureth: Obliuion lies hard-by her drowzie brother, Who readily knowes not her selfe, nor other: Then solitary Morpheus gently rockt: And nasty Sloath self-pyn'd, and poorly frockt, Irresolute, vnhandsom, comfortless, Rubbing her eyes with Poppy, and doth press The yellow Night-shade, and blew Gladiols iuyce, Wher-with her sleep-swoln heauy lids she glews. Confusedly about the silent Bed Fantastick swarms of Dreams there hovered, Green, red, and yellow, tawny, black, and blew: Som sacred, som profane; som false, som true; Som short, som long; som divelish, som divine; Som sad, som glad; but monstrous all (in fine): Simile.They make no noyse, but right resemble may Th'vnnumbred Moats which in the Sun do play, When (at som Cranny) with his piercing ey He peepeth in, som darker place to spy. Thither th'Almighty (with a iust intent To plague those tyrants pride) his Angel sent. No sooner entred, but the radiant shine Of's glistring wings, and of his glorious eyn, As light as Noon, makes the dark House of Night. The gawdy swarm of Dreams is put to slight: And opening wide the sable Canapey The winged Herald summon'd Sleep away. Silence dislodg'd at the first word he spake: But deaf dead Sleep could not so soon awake. Hee's call'd a hundred times, and tugg'd and touz'd, And by the Angel often rubb'd and rouz'd: At length he stirs, and stretching lazily His legs and arms, and opening halfe an ey, Foure or fiue times he yawns; and leaning-on His (Lob-like) elbowe, hears This Message don. Great Spirits-restorer, Cares-charm, Chacing-grief, Night-short'ning Sire, Man's-Rest, and Mind's Relief, Vp, vp (said he) dispatch thee hence in poste, And with thy Poppy drench the conquering Hoste Of those prowd Kings, that (richly charg'd with Prey) On Canaan Mountains lodge in dis-aray. Th'Angel, in th'instant back to Heav'n-ward gon, Sleep slowely harnest his dull Bears anon; And, in a noys-less Coach all darkly dight, Takes with him Silence, Drowsiness and Night: Th'ayr thickning where he goes, doth nod the head, The Woolf in Woods lies down, th'Ox in the Mead, Th'Orque vnder Water; and on Beds of Down Men stretch their limbs, and lay them softly down. The Nightingale, pearcht on the tender spring Of sweetest Haw-thorn, hangs her drowsie wing, The Swallow's silent, and the loudest Humber, Leaning vpon the Earth, now seems to slumber: Th'Yeugh mooues no more, the Asp doth cease to shake, Pines bow their heads, seeming som rest to take. So soon as Sleep's black wings had over-spread The Pagan Hoast; the Souldiers haste to bed: For, instantly begin they all to wink, To hang their heads, and let their weapons sink: Their words half-spoke, are lost between their lips, Through all their veins Sleep's charming humor slips, Which to a deep and death-like Letharge brings Both Heathen Souldiers, and their Heathen Kings. Abram perceiving now the Army neer, Abrams oration to his little Troupe. By their owne Fires; gan thus his Troups to cheer: Souldiers (said he) behold, this happy Night Shall make amends for that dis-astrous Fight Was fought in Siddim, and acquittance cry, For Sodom's shame, and Lot's captivity: Me thinks, already Victory (adorn'd With Bowes, and Blades, and Casks, and Crowns) return'd From th'Enemy, on our triumphant spears Erecteth Tropheis far more rich then theirs: Methinks, already on our glistering Crests, The glorious Garland of the Conquest rests; Our way to vertue lyes so smooth and plain, With pain-less Honour, and vn-vent'red Gain. This Hoast you see, is not the valiant Troup That stript Gomorrha, and made Segor stoop; That Iordan, Inde, and Euphrates admire; But a foul heard of Swine wall'wing in mire: Regard them as they are, not as they were: See but their sloath, do not their number fear: He that's asleep is dead and he that's dead Bites not (they say): What haue we then to dread? Why stay we, Lads? already down they are, Their throats be naked, and their bosoms bare, Their lives lie prostrate heer at our command; And Fortune cals but for your helping hand. Com, follow me; rather, the Lord of Hoasts (Terror of Tyrants) who through all the Coasts Of all the Earth confoundeth (with a thought) All worldly powr, and brings mens plots to nought: Com (happy Troop) follow with one accord Th'invincible brave Standard of the Lord. This sayd; eft-soons I wot not what a grace, What divine beam reflected on his face: Simile.For as in March, the Serpent, having cast His olde foul skin, crawls from his hole full fast, Hisses, and stings, and stares vs in the face, And (gold-like) glistering, glides along the grass: So Heav'n inspires fresh vigour in each part, His blood renews, his heart doth take new heart, A martiall fury in his breast there boyls, His stature seems much taller then yer-whiles, Youth paints his cheeks with Rose and Lilly Dies, A lovely Lightning sparkles in his eyes; So that his gallant Port and gracefull voyce Confirms the faintest, makes the sad reioyce. Abraham sets vpon the Camp of Chedorlaomer.Then, on the Camp he sets, where round about Lie mingled Carrs, and Horse, and Men that rout: Rest seizeth all; and (wanting what it fed) The fire it selfe slept in his ashy bed. Th'Hebrews the-while laid-on on back, or brest, Or arm, or side, according as their Rest To th'ground had bound them; and those liues bereft The which Death's Image in an Image reft. Heer, one beheaded on a Trunk of Pine, Pours-out at once his gore, his ghost, and Wine; The full Helm hops, and with a voyce confused, Murmurs, as if it his fell Fate accused. Another, taken by inchanting sleep, Mid Pots and Cups, and Flagons, quaffing deep, Doth at a wound, given in his rattling gorge, The Wine again in his owne Cup dis-gorge. Another, while ingeniously he plays Vpon his Lute som passing-pleasing Lays, Sleep sieles his eyes vp with a gloomy clowd; And yet his hand still quavers light and lowd: But, at the last it sinks; and, offring fair To strike the Base, strikes but the empty ayr: His soule, descending to th'Infernall Coasts, Goes to conclude his Song vnto the Ghosts: Dolefull it was, not for the Argument (For't was of Loue) but for the sad event. Another, wak'ned with those lowd alarms, Starts-vp, and groapeth round about for arms; Which, ah too soon he findeth, for his part: For a keen poignard stabs him to the heart. Simile.Like as a Tigress, having with the gore Of Buls and Heifers made her spots the more, And pav'd a Plain with Creatures mangled lims, Views on each side her valiant stratagems, Treads on the vanquisht, and is prowdly-sad, That no more Foes, nor no more Maw she had: So th'Hebrew stalking round-about the slain, Braves (but it boots not) and would very fain That those dead bodies might their ghosts re-gather, Or that those Mountains would produce him (rather) Som Foes more wakefull, that more manfully In blood-drown'd Valleis might his valour try. Amor's three sons did no less slaughter make; Abram for zeale, they but for Furies sake: This, nayls a Souldier with his sword to th'ground; That, at a blowe, th'heads of two Heads dis-crown'd. This, vnderneath a Chariot kils the driver: That, lops off legs and arms, and heads doth shiver. The Tents already all in blood do swim, Gushing from sundry Corps, from severall lim. In brief, so many ravening Woolues they seem, Within whose breast, fierce Famine biteth keen, Who softly stealing to som fold of sheep (While both the Shepheard and his Curr doth sleep) Furbush their hungry teeth, tear, kill, and prey Vpon the best, to eat and bear-away. Yet, at the length, the vanquished awake, And (re-aray'd) the Victors vnder-take; Putting the three prowd Amorites, to flight, Who but for Abram, had bin routed quite. Sleep, sleep (poor Pagans) sith you needs must die, Go sleep again, and so die easily, Die yer you think on death, and in your Dreams Gasp-out your soules; Let not your dazled beams Behold the havock and the horror too Of th'Execution, that our swords shall doo, Hacking your bodies to heaw-out your breaths, Yer Death, to fright you with a thousand deaths, Said Abraham: and pointing every word With the keen point of his quick-whirled sword (As swift in doing, as in saying so) More fiercely chargeth the insulting Foe, Than ever storm-full cloud, which fed with Water's Comparison. Thin moist-full fumes (the snowie Mountains daughters) Showr'd heaps of hail-shot, or pour'd floods of rain, On slender stems of the new tender Grain: Through blood, and blades, through danger, dust and death, Through mangled Corps and carrs he traverseth; And partly in the shock, part with the blowes, He breaketh in through thickest of his Foes, And by his travail topsi-turneth then The live and dead, and half-dead horse and men: His bright-keen Fauchin never threats, but hits; Nor hits, but hurts; nor hurts, but that it splits Som priuy postern, whence to Hell (in Post) Som groaning Pagan may gasp out his ghost: He all assayls, and him so brave bestowes, That in his Fight he deals more deaths than blowes. Simile.As the North-winde, re-cleering-vp the front Of clowdy Heav'ns, towards the South doth hunt The showrs that Austers spungie thirst exhales Out of those seas that circle Orans wals: So where-so-e're our Hebrew Champion wield His war-like weapon and his glistring Shield Elamites ouerthrown by Abraham.(Whose glorious splendor darts a dreadfull light) All turn their backs, and all be-take to flight: Forgetting Fame, Shame, Vertue, Hope, and all, Their hearts are don, and down their weapons fall: Or, if that any be so strangely-stout As not to faint, but bravely yet hould out, Alas! it boots not, for it cannot stop The victory, but haste his owne mishap. God giveth victory.But in what Fence-schoole, of what master, say, Brave pearl of Souldiers, learnd thy hands to play So at so sundry weapons, such passados, Such thrusts, such foyns, stramazos, and stoccados? Even of that mighty God, whose sacred might Made Heav'n and Earth (and them so braue bedight) Of meerly nothing: of that God of Powr Who swore to be thy Target and thy Towr: Of that high God, who fortifies the weak, Who teacheth his, even steely bowes to break, Who doth his Childrens zealous hearts inflame; But daunts the prowd, and doth their courage tame. Abraham follows the execution.Thy sword abates th'armed, the strong, the stout; Thou cleav'st, thou kill'st: The faint dis-armed rout, The lightning of thine eyes, thy voyces thunder, And thy stern dreadfull port confounds with wonder: Death and Despair, Horror and Fury fight Vnder thine Ensignes in the dismall Night: Thou slayest this, and that thou threat'st as much: This thou pursu'st, that thou disdaign'st to touch: In brief (thou blest Knight brave) thou quelst at once Valiant and vile, arm'd and vnarmed ones. Heer, thine even hand (even in a twinkling trice) In equall halves a pagans head doth slyce: Down on each shoulder looketh either half, To gaze vpon his gastly Epitaph, In lines of blood writ round about him fair, Vnder the curtain of his parted hair. Heer, through a Ierkin (more then Musket-proof) Made twelue-fold double of East-country Buff, Clean through and through thy deadly shaft doth thrill A Gyants bulk; the wounded hulk doth reel: The head behinde appears; before, the feathers: And th'Ethnick soule flies both-waies out togethers: Heer thou do'st cleaue, with thy keen Fauchins force, The Bards and Breast-plate of a furious Horse, No sooner hurt, but he recoyleth back, Writing his Fortune in a bloody track: Thy Barbed dart, heer at a Chaldee flies, And in an instant lardeth both his thighes, While he (blaspheming his hard stars and state) Hops (like a Pie) in stead of wonted gate. Now Lot (the while) escap't from Elams hands, Lot rescued reuengeth brauely his captiuity. Free from the burthen of his yron bands; With iust revenge retorts his taken wrong, His feet growe swift, his sinnews waxen strong, His heart reviues; and his revived heart Supplies new spirits to all and every part. And as a wilde and wanton Colt, got out Of some great Stable, staring scuds about, Simile. Shakes his proud head and crest, yerks out his heels, Butts at the ayr, beats on the humble fields, His flying shadow now pursues amain, Anon (amaz'd) flies it as fast again, Again beholds it with self-proud delight, Looks on his legs, sets his stiff tayl vpright, And neighs so loud to Mares beyond the Mound, That with the noyse the neighbour hils resound: So, one while Lot sets on a Troup of Horse, A Band of Sling-men he anon doth force, Anon he pusheth through a Stand of Pikes, A Wing of Archers off anon he strikes, Anon he stalks about a steepfull Rock, Where som, to shun Death's (never shunned) stroak, Had clambred-vp; at length a path he spies, Where vp he mounts, and doth their Mount surprise: Whence, stones he heaves, so heauy and so huge, That in our Age, three men could hardly bouge; Vnder whose waight his flying Foes he dashes: And in their flesh, bones, stones, and steel he pashes: Somtimes he shoots, somtimes he shakes a Pike, Which death to many, dread to all doth strike. Som in the breast he wounds, som in the backs, Som on the hanch, som on the head he hacks, He heaws down all; and maketh where he stood A Mount of bodies in a Moat of blood. At length the Pagans wholly left the place. The Pagans wholly put to flight. Then both sides ran; these chased, those do chase: These only vse their heels; those heels and hands: Those wish but a fair way; these that the sands Would quickly gape, and swallow quick to Hell Themselues that fled, and them that chaç't so fell: These render nought but blowes; those nought but blood: Both sides have broak their Ranks: pel-mel they scud; Choakt-vp with dust, disordered, dis-aray'd; Neither, Command, Threat, nor Intreat obay'd. Thou that (late) bragdst, that thy White Wormly braue Could dry-foot run vpon the liquid Waue, And on the sand leaving no print behinde Out-swifted Arrows, and out-went the Winde, With a steel Dart, by Abrah'm stifly sent, Art 'twixt thy Cuirace and thy Saddle slent: And thou that thrice, neer Tigris silver source, Hadst won the Bell, as best in every Course, Art caught by Lot, and (thrild from side to side) Loosest thy speed-praise, and thy life beside. It seems no Fight, but (rather as befals) An execution of sad criminals: Who-so escapes the sword, escapes not so His sad destruction; or, if any tho Escap't at all, they were but few (at least) To rue the fatall ruine of the rest: For th'Vncle and the Nephew never lin, Till out of Canaan they haue chac't them clean: Simile.Like to a Cast of Falcons that pursue A flight of Pidgeons through the welkin blew; Stooping at this and that, that to their Louver, (To saue their liues) they hardly can recover. The Kings of Canaan receiued Abraham and his c?pany with great ioy &amp; the gratefull offer of their homage vnto him.At his return from Fight, the Kings and Lords Of Palestine, with glad and humble words, Do welcom Abram, and refresh his Troop; To 's knees their heads, to 's feet their knees they stoop: O valiant Victor! for thy high deserts, Accept the homage of our humble hearts. Accept our gratefull zeal: or, if ought more (As well thou mayst) thou dost expect therefore, Accept (said they) our Lands, our goods, our golde, Our wiues, our liues, and what we deerest holde: Take all we haue; for all we haue is thine: No wrong to vs, to take thy Valours Fine. Melchisedech blesseth Abraham. Melchisedec, Gods sacred Minister, And King of Salem, coms to greet him there, Blessing his bliss, and thus with zealous cry Devoutly pearç't Heav'ns starfull Canopey. Blest be the Lord, that with his hand doth roule The radiant Orbs that turn about the Pole; And rules the Actions of all Humane-kinde With full command; and with one blast of winde Razes the Rocks, and rends the proudest Hils, Dries-vp the Ocean, and the Empty fils: Blest be the great God of great Abraham: From Age to Age extolled be his Name: Let every Place vnto him Altars build, And every Altar with his Praise be fill'd, And every Praise above the Welkin ring As loud or louder then the Angels sing: Blessed be He that by an Arm-less crew Of Art-less Shepheards did so quick subdue And tame the Tamers of Great Syria so; And to the servants of an exil'd Foe Hath given the Riches and the royall store (Both of their Booty and their Owne before) Of such an Hoast of Nations that first see Sol's early rising from Aurora's knee. But Abraham, to prove that not for Prey, Abraham distributes the booty, reseruing only a portion for the Amorites that were his c?federates. He put-on arms,, divides the Spoyls away: The Tythe's the Priests: the Rest of all the things (Yerst lost in field) he renders to the Kings, Save but the Portion He participates To th'Amorites, his stout Confederates: Shewing himselfe a Prince as Politicke Prudent and iust, as stout and Souldier-like, That with his Prowess Policy can mel, And Conquering, can vse his Conquest well, Magnanimous in deeds, in words as meek, That scorning Riches, true Renown doth seek. So, from the Sea, even to th'Euphratean-source, He is famous far and neer. And even from Dan, to Nilus crystall course, Rings his renown: Of him is all the speech, At home, abroad; among the poor and rich, In war and peace: the Fame of his high deeds Confirms the Faithfull in their fainting Creeds; And terrifies the Tyrant Infidels, Shaking the sides of their proud Citadels, That with their fronts the seat of Iove do scorn, And with their feet at Pluto's crown do spurn. Voice, Harp, and Timbrel sound his praise together, Hee's held a Prophet or an Angel rather, They say that God talks with him face to face, Hoasts at his house, and to his happy Race Gives in Fee-simple all that goodly Land Even from the Sea, as far as Tigris strand. And it is certain, the Thrice-sacred-One, God appears vnto him, and maketh covenant with him. The King of Kings, by Dream or Vision, Speaks with him oft; and cals him thus by name: Faint not my servant, fear not Abraham; I am no fiend that with a fained lip Seek guilefully thy simpleness to trip, Nor to intice thee (with a baen-full breath) To bite (like Adam) a new fruit of death: 'Tis I, that brought thee from thy Natiue Var, From night to day, from death to life (thus far) I brought thee hither, I haue blest thee heer, I with thy flocks haue covered far and neer Canaan's fat Hils; I haue preserv'd thy Wife From strangers lust, and thee from Tyrants knife, When thy faint heart, and thy false tongue, affray'd To tell the Truth, her and thy selfe betray'd: 'Tis I, that haue so oft from Heathens powr Preserv'd thy person; and (as Conquerour) Now made thee Triumph over th'Eastern Kings (Whereof so far thy famous Valour rings): I am (in briefe) I am the Lord thy God, Thy help at home, thy Guide and Guard abroad. Keep thou my Covenant: and (to signifie, That to the World thou dy'st, to liue to Mee) Circumcision instituted.Go Circumcise forth-with thy Selfe and Thine, Lead holy Life, walke in my Wayes divine With vpright-foot: so shall my favour hant Thy House and thee, and thou shalt nothing want: No, I will make thee Lord of all the Land Canaan promised to Abraham.Which Canaans Children haue with mighty hand So long possest; a happy Land that flowes With milk and hony: a rich Land where growes (Even of it selfe) all kinde of Fruit and Corn, Where smiling Heav'ns pour-down their Plenties-horn: I'l heap thee there with Honour, Wealth, and Powr, I will be thy Reward, thy Shield, and Towr. O Lord (said Abram) though into my lap In showrs of Gold ev'n all the Heav'ns should drop, What booted all, to me that am alone? Alas! my Lord, I haue enough, for one That hath no issue after to inherit, But my good servant Eleazar's merit. Not so, my Son (replies th'Omnipotent) Mistake not so my bountifull intent; I'l not disparage to a Servants Fee The rich estate, and royall Dignity That in my People shall hereafter shine: No, no (mine Abram) even a stock of thine, Thine own deer Nephews, even thy proper Seed Shall be thine Heirs, and in thy state succeed. Yea, thine own Son's immortal-mortall Race Shall holde in gage the treasures of my Grace. The Patriarch, then rapt with sudden Ioy, Made answer thus: Lives then my wandring Boy? Lives Ismael? is Ismael alive? O happy news! (Lord let him ever thrive) And shall his Seed succeed so eminent? Ah! let me die then: then I die content. Ismael indeed doth live (the Lord replies) And lives, to father mighty Progenies: For, from the Day when first his Mother (flying Thy iealous Sara's curst and threatfull crying) To the dry Desarts sandy horror hy'd, I have for both been carefull to provide; Their extream Thirst due-timely to refresh, Conducting them vnto a Fountain fresh, In liquid Crystall of whose Mayden spowt Bird never dipt her bill, nor Beast his snowt. And if I err not (but, I cannot err: For, what is hid from Hearts-Artificer? What can the sight of the Sight-maker dim)? Another Exile yet attendeth him, Wher-in he shall (in season) feel and finde, How much to him I will be good and kinde. He shall growe Great, yet shall his rest be small; All shall make war on him, and He on all: Through Corslets, Rivets, Iacks, and Shirts of Mail, Ismaels mightinesse. His shaft shall thrill the Foes that him assail: A swift Hart's heart he shall (even running) hit: A Sparrows head he shall (even flying) split: And in the ayr shall make the Swallow cease His sweet-sweet note, and slicing nimbleness. Yea (O Saints-Firstling) onely for thy sake, Twelue mighty Princes will I shortly make Spring from his Loigns, whose fruitfull seed shall sway Even vnto Sur from golden Havila. Yet, 'tis not He, with whom I mean to knit Mine inward Covenant; th'outward seal of it Ismael may bear, but not the efficace (Thy Son, but after flesh, not after Grace). But to declare that vnder Heav'ns Frame, I holde nought deerer then mine Abraham, I'l open Sara's dry and barren womb, From whence thine Isaac (Earths delight) shall com, Isaac promised. To glad the World; a Son that shall (like thee) Support the Faith, and prop her Family. Com from thy Tent, com forth and heer contemple The golden Wonders of my Throne and Temple, Number the Stars, measure their bigness bright, With fixed ey gaze on their twinkling Light, Exactly mark their ordered Courses, driven In radiant Coaches through the Lists of Heav'n: Then may'st thou also number thine own Seed, And comprehend their Faith, and plainly reade Their noble acts, and of their Publike-State Draw an Idea in thine own conceit. In him the Couenant ratified.This, This is He, to and with whom I grant Th'eternall Charter of my Covenant. Which if he truly keep, vpon his Race I'l pour an Ocean of my plentious Grace: I'l not alone giue him the Fields heer seen, But even from India all that flowreth green To th'vtmost Ocean's vtmost sand and shelfe; I'l giue him Heav'n, I'l giue him even my Selfe. Of his ligne shall come Christ the Redeemer.Hence, hence, the High and mighty Prince shall spring, Sin's, Death's, and Hell's eternall taming King, The sacred Founder of Man's soveraign Bliss, World's peace, world's ransom, and World's righteousness. Th'Eternall seem'd then towards Heav'n to hie, Th'olde-man to follow him with a greedy eye, The sudden dis-appearing of the Lord, Seem'd like to Powder fired on a boord, When smokingly it mounts in sudden slash, With little flame, giving a little clash. Prosperity pIungeth the Sodomites in all manner of abhominations.Plenty and Pleasure had o'r-whelm'd the while Sodom and Gomor in all Vices vile: So that, already the most ruth-less Rape Of tender Virgins of the rarest shape, Th'Adulterous kiss (which Wedlocks bands vnbindes) Th'Incestuous Bed, confounding Kindreds kindes (Where Father wooes the Daughter, Sister Brother, Th'Vncle the Niece, and even the Son the Mother) They did not hate, nor (as they ought) abhor, But rather scorn'd, as sports they car'd not for. Forbear (deer Younglings) pray a-while forbear, Stand farther from me, or else stop your ear, At th'obscœne sound of th'vnbeseeming words Which to my Muse this odious place affords: Or, if it's horror cannot drive you hence, Hearing their Sin, pray hear their Punishments. These beastly Men (rather these man-like Beasts) Could not be fill'd with Venvs vulgar Feasts; Fair Nature could not furnish their Desire; Their most execrable sin.Som monstrous mess these Monsters did require: An execrable flame inflam'd their harts, Prodigiously they play'd the Womens parts: Male hunted Male; and acted, openly, Their furious Lusts in fruitless Venery. Therefore, to purge Vlcers so pestilent, Two heav'nly Scowts the Lord to Sodom sent; 2. Angels sentdown, receiued and guested by Lot. Whom (deeming Mortals) Lot importunates To take his Lodging and to taste his Cates. For, Angels, being meer Intelligences, Haue (properly) no Bodies nor no senses: But (sacred Legats of the Holy-One) Of the nature and essence of Angels. To treat with vs, they put our Nature on; And take a body fit to exercise The Charge they have, which runs, and feeds, and flies; Dures during their Commission; and, that past, Turns t'Elements whence first it was amasst. A simple Spirit (the glittering Childe of Light) Vnto a bodie doth not so vnite, As to the Matter Form incorporates: But, for a season it accomodates, As to his Tool the quaint Artificer, (That at his pleasure makes the same to stir) Yet in such sort that th'instrument (we see) Holdes much of him that moves it actively. But alwaies in som place are Angels: though Not as all filling (God alone is so, The spirit which all good spirits in spirit adore, In all, on all, with-out all, evermore): Nor as inviron'd (That alone agrees To bodies bounded with extreamities Of the next substance; and whose superfice Vnto their place proportionable is): But rather, as sole selfly limited, And ioyn'd to place, yet not as quantiti'd; But by the touch of their liue efficace, Containing Bodies which they seeem t'embrace: So, visibly those bodies move, and oft By word of Mouth bring arrands from aloft, And eat with vs; but, not for sustentation, Nor naturally, but by meer dispensation. Such were the sacred Guests of this good Prince: Such, curteous Abraham feasted in his Tents, When, seeing three, he did adore but one, Which, comming down from the celestiall Throne, Fore-told the sad and sudden Tragedy, Of these loose Cities, for their Luxury. You that your Purse do shut, and doors do bar Exhortation to Hospitality. Against the colde, faint, hungry Passenger, You little think that all our life and Age Is but an Exile and a Pilgrimage: And that in earth whoso hath never given Harbour to Strangers, shall have none in Heaven, Where solemn Nuptials of the Lamb are held; Where Angels bright and Soules that haue exceld, All clad in white, sing th'Epithalamie, Carowsing Nectar of Eternitie. The Iust-full Sodomites, inflamed with the beauty of the Angels, mutiny against Lot for harboring them.Sans Hospitality, the Pilgrim poor For Bed-fellow might haue a Woolf or Boar: What e'r is given the Strange and Needy one, Is not a gift (indeed) but 't is a Loan, A Loan to God, who payes with interest; And (even in this life) guerdons even the least. For, alms (like levain) make our goods to rise, And God his owne with blessings plentifies. O Hosts, what knowe you, whether (charitable) When you suppose to feast men at your Table, You guest Gods Angels in Mens habit hid, (Heav'n-Citizens) as this good Hebrew did? Who supped them: and when the time grew meet To go to bed, he heard amid the street A wrangling iangling, and a murmur rude, Which great, grew greater through Nights solitude. For, those that first these two bright Stars survay'd, Wilde Stalion-like, after their beauties naigh'd; But, seeing them by the chaste Stranger sav'd, Shame-less and sense-less vp and down they rav'd, From House to House knocking at every dore, And beastly-brute, thus, thus they rail and rore; Brethren, shall we endure this Fugitive, This Stranger Lot, our pleasures to deprive? O Cowardise! to suffer in our sights An exile heer t'vsurp our choise delights, T'embrace a brace of Youths so beautious (Rather two Gods com-down from Heaven to vs)? Shall it be said that such an olde colde stock Such rare yong Minions in his bed should mock: While wretched we, vnto our selves make mone, And (Widow-like) wear out our sheets alone? Let's rather break his doors, and make him knowe, Such dainty morsels hang not for his Mowe. Simile. Even as at Bathe, down from the neighbour hils, After a Snowe, the melting Crystall trils Into the Avon (when the Pythian Knights Strips those steep Mountains of their shirts so white) Through hundred Valleis gushing Brooks and Torrents, Striving for swiftness in their sundry Currents, Cutting deep Chanels where they chance to run, And never rest till all do meet in one: So, at their cry, from every corner throng Vnto Lot's house, Men, Children; olde, and yong. For, common was this execrable sin: With blear-ey'd Age, as nusled long therein; With Youth, through rage of lust; with Infancy, Example-led: all through Impunity. And thus, they all cry out; Ope, ope the dore, Com, open quickly, and delay no more: Let-forth that lovely Payr, that they may prove With vs the pleasures of Male-mingled love. Lot lowely then replies: Brethren and Friends, Lot speaks th? fair, &amp; intreats them earnestly for the safety of his guests. By all the names that amity commends, By Nature's Rules, and Rights of Hospitality, By sacred Laws and lessons of Morality, By all respects of our com-Burgership (Which should our mindes in mutuall kindness keep) I do adiure you all, that you refrain The honour of my harm-less guests to stain, Nor in your hearts to harbour such a thought Whereby their Vertues may be wrongd in ought. Base busie Stranger, com'st thou hither, thus Their insolent reply. (Controller-like) to prate and preach to Vs? No (Puritan) thou shalt not heer do so: Therefore dispatch and let thy darlings go; Let-forth that lovely Payr, that they may prove With vs the pleasures of Male-mingled love. The horror of this sin, their stubborn rage, His sacred promise given his Guests for gage, Th'olde Hebrew's minde so trouble and dismay, That well he wots not what to do nor say. For, though we ought not (if Gods Word be true) Do any evill that good may ensue: To shun one ill, another ill he suffers, He prostitutes his Issue; and he offers, He offers them his own daughters to rescue his Guests. Lambs to the guard of Wolues: and thus he cries, I have (with that, the tears ran-down his eyes) I have two daughters that be Virgins both; Go, take them to you (yet alas full loth) Go, crop the first-fruits to their Bride-grooms due (O! death to think it): But let none of you Abuse my chaste Guests with such villany As merits Fire from Heav'n immediately; A Sin so odious, that the Name alone Good men abhor, yea even to think vpon. Tush: we are glutted with all granted loves, Their monstrous impudencie. And common Pleasures nought our pleasure moves: Lot, our delights (ty'd to no law's conformity) Consist not in the pleasure, but th'enormity, Which fools abhor: and, saying so they rush, Som vpon Lot, som at his gates do push. O cursed City! where the aged Sire, Vn-able thus to doe, doth thus desire; And Younglings, yet scarce weaned from their Nurse, Strive with their Elders whether shall be worse; Full is the measure of thy monstrous sin: Thy Canker now o'r all thy bulk hath bin. Impudence in sinning, doubles the guilt of sin.God hates all sin: but, extream Impudence Is even a greater sin than the Offence: The sweet kinde Kisses of chaste Man and Wife Although they seem by God and Nature (rife) Rather commanded then allow'd, and graç't In their sweet fruits (their issue choicely-chaste) With Law's large priviledge; yet evermore (As Modestie and Honestie implore) Ought to be private, and (as things forbidden Vnto the sight) with Night's black curten hidden. Yet, these foul Monsters, in the open street Where altogether all the Town might see't, Most impudent, dare perpetrate a sin Which Hell it selfe before had never seen; A sin so odious, that the fame of it Will fright the damned in the darksom Pit. Before their fearfull destruction, the Angels bring Lot and his family safe out of the Citie.But now, the Angels, their celestiall kinde Vn-able longer to conceal, strook blinde Those beastly Letchers, and brought safe away Lot and his houshold by the break of day. But, O prodigious! never rose the Sun More beautifull, nor brighter shin'd-vpon All other places (for he rose betimes To see such Execution on such Crimes): And yet, it lowrs, it lightens, and it thunders, It rores, it rains (O most vnwonted wonders!) Vpon this Land, which 'gainst th'Omnipotent Had warr'd so long with sins so insolent: And 'gainst the pride of those detested livers, Heav'n seems to empty all his wrathfull Quivers. From Acheron, even all the Furies hie, And all their Monsters them accompany, With all their tortures and their dismall terrors, And all their Chaos of confused Horrors; All on the the guilty strand of Iordan storm, And with their Fire-brands all to Sodom swarm, As thick as Crowes in hungry shoals do light Simile.On new-sowen lands; where stalking bold vpright, As black as Iet they iet about, and feed On Wheat, or Rye, or other kinde of seed; Kaaking so loud, that hardly can the Steer The whistling Goad-man's guiding language hear. It rain'd indeed; but, not such fertile rain As makes the Corn in Sommer sprout amain; The manner of their punishm?t by fire &amp; brimstone from Heauen, &amp; the reason thereof. And all things freshed with a pleasant ayr, To thrive, and prove more lively, strong and fair: But in this sink of Sin, this stinking Hell, A rain of Salt, of Fire and Brimston, fell. Salt did consume the pleasant fruitfulness, Which serv'd for fewell to their Wantonness: Fire punished their beastly Fire within: And Brimstone's stink the stench of their foul Sin. So, as their Sin was singular (of right) Their Punishment was also exquisite: Heer, open Flames, and there yet hidden Fires Burn all to ashes, sparing neither Spires Of Brick nor Stone, nor Columns, Gates, nor Arches, Nor Bowrs, nor Towrs, nor even their neighbour-Marches. In vain the-while the People weep and cry, The same most liuely represented. To see their wrack and know no remedy: For, now the Flame in richest Roofs begun, From molten gutters scalding Lead doth run, The Slats and Tyles about their ears do split, The burning Rafters Pitch and Rosin spet: The whirling Fire re-mounteth to the Skie, About the fields ten thousand sparks do flie; Half-burned houses fall with hideous fray, And Vvlcan makes Mid-night as bright as Day: Heaven flings down nought but flashing Thunder-shot, Th'Air's all a-fire, Earth's exhalations hot Are spewing Ætna's that to Heaven aspire: All th'Elements (in briefe) are turn'd to fire. Heer, one perceiving the next Chamber burning, With sudden leap towards the window turning, Thinks to cry Fire: but instantly the smoke And Flame with-out, his with-in Voyce do choke, Another sooner feels then sees the Fire. For, while (O horror!) in the stinking mire Of his foul Lust he lies, a Lightning flash Him and his Love at-once to dust doth dash: Th'abhorred Bed is burnt; and they, aswell Coupled in Plague as Sin, are sent to Hell. Another yet on tops of Houses crawls: But, his foot slips, and down at last he fals. Another feeling all his cloathes a-fire, Thinking to quench them yer it should com nigher, Leaps in a Lake: but all the Lake began To boyl and bubble like a seething Pan, Simile. Or like a Chaldron that top-full of Oyl, Environ'd round with fume and flame doth boyl, To boyl to death som cunning counterfait That with falfe stamp som Princes Coyn hath beat. Another, seeing the Citie all in Cinders, Himselfe for safety to the fields he renders: But flakes of fire, from Heav'n distilling thick, There th'horror of a thousand Deaths do strike. Through Adamah's and Gomor's goodly Plains, Sodom and Seboim not a soule remains: Horse, Sheep, and Oxen, Cows and Kids partake In this revenge, for their vile Masters sake. Thus hath the hand of the Omnipotent Inroll'd the Deed of their drad Punishment, With Diamantin Pen, on Plates of Brass, With such an Ink as nothing can deface: The moulten Marble of these cindred Hils, Asphaltis Lake, and these poor mock-fruit Fields Keep the Record; and cry through every Age, How God detesteth such detested rage. O chastisement most dradly-wonderfull! Th'Heav'n-cindred Cities a broad standing Pool O'r-flowes (yet flowes not) whose infectious breath Corrupts the Ayr, and Earth dis-fertileth: A Lake, whose back, whose belly, and whose shoar, Nor Bark, nor Fish, nor Fowl hath ever bore. The pleasant Soyl that did (even) shame yer-while The plentious beauties of the banks of Nile, Now scarr'd, and collowed, with his face and head Cover'd with ashes, is all dry'd and dead; Voyd of all force, vitall, or vegetive; Vpon whose brest nothing can live or thrive: For, nought it bears save an abortive suit Of seeming-fair, false, vain, and fained fruit, A fruit that feeds the ey, and fils the hand, But to the stomach in no steed doth stand; For, even before it touch the tender lips Or Ivory teeth, in empty smoak it slips, So vanishing: onely the nose receives A noysom savour, that (behinde) it leaves. Exhortation to Trauailers that haue seen, &amp; to others that shall reade or heare these fearfull monuments of Gods seuere Instice, to make right vse of this fearfull Example.Heer, I adjure you vent'rous Trauailours, That visit th'horror of these cursed shoars, And taste the venom of these stinking streams, And touch the vain fruit of these withered stems: And also you that do beholde them thus In these sad Verses portray'd heer by vs, To tremble all, and with your pearly tears To showr another Sea; and that your hairs Staring vpright on your affrighted head Heave-vp your Hats; and, in your dismall dread, To think, you hear like Sulph'ry Storms to strike On our new Monsters for Offences like. For, the Almighties drad all-danting arm Not only strikes such as with Sodom swarm In these foul Sins; but such as sigh or pity Sodoms destruction, or so damn'd a Citie, And cannot constant with dry eyes observe God's iudgements iust on such as such deserve. Lot hies to Segor: but his wife behinde Lots wife Metamorphosed. Lagged in body, but much more in minde: She weeps and wails (O lamentable terror! O impious Piety! O kinde-cruell error!) The dire destruction of the smoking Cities, Her Sons-in-Law (which should haue been) she pities, Grieves so to leave her goods, and she laments To lose her Iewels and habilliments: And (contrary to th'Angels Words precise) Towards the Town she turns her wofull eyes. But instantly, turn'd to a whitely stone, Her feet (alas!) fast to the ground be growne. The more she stirs, she sticks the faster in: As silly Bird caught in a subtill gin, Set by som Shepheard neer the Copses side, Simile. The more it struggles is the faster ty'd. And, as the venom of an eating Canker Simile. From flesh to flesh runs every day the ranker, And never rests, vntill from foot to head O'r all the Body his fell poyson spread: This Ice creeps-vp, and ceaseth not to num, Till even the marrow hard as bones becom, The brain be like the scull, and blood convert To Alablaster over every part; Her Pulse doth cease to beat, and in the ayr The windes no more can wave her scattered hayr: Her belly is no belly, but a Quar Of Cardon Rocks, and all her bowels are A pretious Salt-Mine, supernaturall; Such, as (but Salt) I wot not what to call; A Salt, which (seeming to be fall'n from Heav'n) To curious Spirits hath long this Lesson given, Not to presume in Divine things to pry, Which seav'n-times seal'd, vnder nine Locks do lie. She weeps (alas!) and as she weeps, her tears Turn in to Pearls fro'rn on her thinkling hairs; Fain would she speak: but (forced to conceal) In her cold throat her guilty words congeal; Her mouth yet open, and her arms a-cross, Though dumb, declare both why and how she was Thus Metamorphos'd: for, Heav'n did not change Her last sad gestures in her sudden Change. No gorgeous Mausole, grac't with flattering verse, Eternizeth her Trunk, her House, and Herse; But, to this Day (strange will it seem to som) One and the same is both the Corps and Tomb. Almighty Father! Gracious God and Iust! Mans proneness to fall, without the support of Gods gracious fauour. O! what hard heartedness, what brutish Lust, Pursueth man, if thou but turn thy face, And take but from vs thy preventing grace; And, if provoked for our past offences, Thou give vs vp to our Concupiscences? O Harran's Nieces, you (Lots daughters) saw Sodom consumed in that Sulphry flaw: Their Hils and Forrests calcined (in fine) Their liberall fields sowen with a burning brine, Their stately houses like a coal-pit smoaking, The Sun it selfe with their thick vapours choking: So that within a yard for stinking smother The Labourers could hardly knowe each other; Their flowring Valley to a Fen exchang'd: And your own Mother to a Salt-stone chang'd: Yet all (alas!) these famous Monuments Of the iust rigour of God's Punishments Cannot deterr you: but even Sodom-like Incestuously a holy-man you seek; Even your owne Father, whom with wine you fill; And then by turns intice him to your will: Lot drawn by his Daughters, in drunkeness to commit Incest with both of them.Conceiving so (O can heav'n suffer it!) Even of that seed which did your selues beget: Within your wombs you bear for nine months time Th'vpbraiding burden of your shame-less Crime: And troubling Kindred's names and Nature quight, You both becom, even in one very Night, Wiues to your Fathers, Sisters to your Sons, And Mothers to your Brothers all at once; All vnder colour, that thus living sole, Sequestred thus in an vnhanted hole, Heav'ns enuy should all Adam's race have reft, And Lot alone should in the World be left. Had't not been better, never to have bred, Than t'have conceived in so foul a bed? Had't not been better never t'have been Mothers, Than by your Father, to have born your Brothers? Had't not been better to the death to hate, Then thus t'have lov'd him that you both begate? Him, so much yours, that yours he mought not be? Sith of these Rocks God could immediatly Have rais'd Lot Son-in-lawes; or, striking but Th'Earths solid bosom with his brazen foot, Out of the dust haue reared sudden swarms Of People, stay'd in Peace, and stout in Arms. FINIS. The Fathers. A PART OF THE II PART OF THE III. DAY OF THE II. WEEK. The Argvment. The famous Father of the Faithfull, heer Limn'd to the life, in strife of Faith and Fear: His Sonn's sweet nature, and his nurture such, Endeer his Triall with a neerer Touch: Keason's best Reasons are by Faith refell'd; With God, th'Affection, for the Action held; So, counter-manding His command (atchiev'd) The Sire's approved, and the Son repriev'd. Heer (had our Author liv'd, to end his Works) Should have ensu'd the other Patriarchs. O! 'Tis a Heav'nly and a happy turn, Of godly Parents to be timely born: To be brought-vp vnder the watchfull eyn Of milde-sharp Masters awfull Discipline: Chiefly, to be (even from the very first) With the pure milk of true Religion nurst. Such hap had Isaac: but his Inclination Exceeds his Birth, excels his Education. His Faith, his Wit, Knowledge, and Iudgement sage, Out-stripping Time, anticipate his age. For (yet a Childe) he fears th'Eternall Lord, And wisely waits all on his Fathers word; Whose steady steps so duly he observes, That every look, him for a lesson serves: And every gesture, every wink and beck, For a command, a warning and a check: So that, his toward Diligence out-went His fathers hopes and holy document. Now, though that Abram were a man discreet, Sober and wise, well knowing what is meet; Though his dear Son somtimes he seem to chide, Yet hardly can he his affection hide: For, evermore his love-betraying ey On's darling Isaac glanceth tenderly: Sweet Isaac's face seems as his Glass it were, And Isaac's name is musick in his ear. But God, perceiving this deep-settled Love, Thence takes occasion Abrams Faith to prove; And tempteth him: but not as doth the Divell His Vassals tempt (or Man his Mate) to evill: Satan still draws vs to Deaths dismall Path; But God directs where Death no entry hath: Ay Satan aims our constant Faith to foil; But God doth seal it, never to recoil: Satan suggesteth ill; God moves to grace: The Divell seeks our Baptisme to deface; But God, to make our burning Zeal to beam The brighter ay in his Ierusalem. A Prince, that means effectuall proof to make Simile. Of som Mans faith that he doth newly take, Examins strictly, and with much a-doo, His Words and Deeds, and every gesture too; And, as without, within as well to spy-him, Doth carefully by all means sift and try-him. But God ne'r seeks by Triall of Temptation To sound Mans heart and secret cogitation (For, well he knowes Man, and his ey doth see All thoughts of men yer they conceived be): But this is still his high and holy drift, When through temptation he his Saints doth sift, To leave for pattern to his Churches seed Their stedfast Faith, and never-daunted Creed. Yet, out of season God doth never try His new-converted Children, by and by: Such novices would quickly faint and shrink: Such ill-rigg'd ships would even in lanching sink: Their Faiths light blossoms would with every blast Be blown away, and bear no fruit at last: Against so boistrous stroaks they want a shield: Vnder such weight their feeble strength would yield. But when his Words dear seed, that he hath sowen Within their hearts, is rooted well and growen: And when they have a broad thick Breast-plate on, High peril-proof against affliction: Such as our Abram: Who, now waxen strong Through exercise of many trials long, Of faith, of love, of fortitude and right. Who, by long weary wandrings day and night, By often Terrors, Lots Imprisonment, His Wifes twice taking, Ismaels banishment, Being made invincible for all assaults Of Heav'n and Earth, and the infernall Vaults; Is tempted by the Voice which made all things, Which sceptreth Shepheards, and vn-crowneth Kings. Invocation.Give me a voice, now, O Voice all divine! With sacred fire inflame this breast of mine: Ah! ravish me, make all this Vniverse Admire thine Abram pourtraid in my Verse. Mine Abram, said the Lord dear Abraham, Thy God, thy King, thy Fee, thy Fence I am: Hy straight to Salem, and there quickly kill Thine own Son Isaac; on that sacred Hill Heaw him in peeces, and commit the same In sacrifice vnto the ragefull Flame. Simile.As he, that slumbering on his carefull Bed, Seems to discern som Fancy full of dread, Shrinks down himself, and fearfull hides his face, And scant draws breath in half an howers space: So Abraham at these sharp-sounding words (Which wound him deeper than a thousand swords) Seized at once with wonder, grief and fright, Is well-nigh sunk in Deaths eternall night; Death's ash-pale Image in his eyes doth swim, A chilling Ice shivers through every lim, Flat on the ground himself he groveling throwes, A hundred times his colour coms and goes, From all his body a cold deaw doth drop, His speech doth fail, and every sense doth stop. But, self-return'd, two sounding sobs he cast, Then two deep sighes, then these sad words at last: Cruell command, quoth He, that I should kill A tender Infant, innocent of ill: That in cold blood I (barbarously) should murder My (fear-less, fault-less) faithfull Friend; nay (further) Mine own dear Son: and what dear Son? Alas! Mine onely Isaac (whose sweet vertues pass The lovely sweetnes of his angel-face) Isaac, sole Pattern of now-Vertue knowen; Isaac, in yeers yong, but in wisdom growen; Isaac, whom good men love, the rest envy: Isaac, my hearts heart, my lifes life, must dy. That I should stain an execrable Shrine With Isaac's warm blood, issued out of mine. O! might mine serve, 't were tolerable loss, 'T were little hurt; nay, 't were a welcom cross. I bear no longer fruit: the best of Mee Is like a fruit-less, branch-less, sap-less Tree, Or hollow Trunk, which onely serves for staies To crawling Ivie's weak and winding spraies. But, losing Isaac, I not onely leese My life withall (which Heav'ns have linkt to his) But (O!) more millions of Babes yet vn-bore, Than there be sands vpon the Lybian shoar. Canst thou, mine Arm? O! canst thou, cruell Arm; In Isaac's breast thy bloody weapon warm? Alas! I could not but even dy for grief, Should I but yield mine Ages sweet relief (My bliss, my comfort, and mine eys delight) Into the hands of Hang-mens spare-less spight: But, that mine own self (O extreamest Rigour!) What my self formed, should, my self, dis-figure: That I (alas!) with bloody hand and knife, Should rip his bosom, rend his heart and life: That (odious Author of a Precedent So rarely ruth-less) I should once present, Vpon a sacred Altar, an Oblation So barbarous (O brute abomination!) That I should broil his flesh, and in the flame Behould his bowels crackling in the same; 'Tis horrible to think, and hellish too, Cruell to wish, impossible to doo. Doo't he that lists, and that delights in blood: I neither will, nor can becom so wood, T'obey in this: God, whom we take to be Th'eternall Pillar of all verity, And constant faith; will he be faith-less now? Will he be false, and from his promise bow? Will he (alas!) vndoo what he hath don, Mar what he makes, and lose what he hath won? Sail with each winde? and shall his promise, then, Serve but for snares t'intrap sincerest men? Somtimes, by his eternall self he swears, That my Son Isaac's number-passing Heirs Shall fill the Land, and that his fruitfull Race Shall be the blessed levain of his Grace; Now he commands me his dear life to spill, And in the Cradle my health's Hope to kill, To drown the whole World in the blood of him; And at one stroak, vpon his fruitfull stem, To strike-off all the heads of all the flock That should heerafter his drad Name invoke, His sacred nostrils with sweet smels delight, His ears with praises, with good deeds his sight. Will God impugn himself? and will he so By his command his Covenant overthrowe? And shall my faith my faith's confounder be? Then faith, or doubting, are both one to me. Alas! what saist thou, Abram? pawse thou must. He that revives the Phœnix from her dust, And from dead Silk-worms Toombs (their shining Clews) A living bird with painted wings renews; Will he forget Isaac, the onely stock Of his chaste Spouse (his Church and chosen Flock)? Will he forget Isaac, the onely Light Of all the World, for Vertues lustre bright? Or, can he not (if't please him) even in death Restore him life, and re-inspire him breath? But mark, the while thou bringest for defence The All-proof Towr of his Omnipotence, Thou shak'st his Iustice. This is certain (too) God can doo all, save that he will not doo. He loves none ill: for, when the wreakfull Waves Were all return'd into their wonted Caves; When all the Meads, and every fruitfull Plain, Began (with ioy) to see the Sun again; So soon as Noah (with a gladsom heart) Forth of his floating Prison did depart, God did forbid Murder: and nothing more Then Murder, doth his Maiesty abhor. But (shallow man) sound not the vast Abyss Of God's deep Iudgements, where no ground ther is: Be sober-wise: so, bound thy frail desire: And, what thou canst not comprehend, admire. God our Lawmaker (iust and righteous) Maketh his Laws, not for himself, but vs: He frees himself; and flees with his Powrs wing, No where, but where his holy will doth bring: All that he doth is good: but not therefore Must he needs doo it 'cause 't was good before: But good is good, because it doth (indeed) From him (the Root of perfect good) proceed: From him, the Fountain of pure Righteousnes: From him, whose goodnes nothing can express. Ah, profane thoughts! O wretch! and think'st thou then That God delights to drink the blood of men? That he intends by such a strange impiety To plant his service? You, you forged deity Of Molech, Milchom, Camosh, Astaroth, Your damned shrines with such dire Orgies blot: You Tyrants, you delight in Sacrifice Of slaughtered Children: 't is your bloody guise (You cruell Idols) with such Hecatombs To glut the rage of your outrageous dooms: You hould no sent so sweet, no gift so good, As streaming Rivers of our luke-warm blood: Not Abram's God (ay gracious, holy, kinde) Who made the World but onely for Mankinde: Who hates the bloody hands; his Creatures loves; And contrite hearts for sacrifice approves. You, you, disguiz'd (as angels of the light) Would make my God Author of this despight, Supplant my Faith on his sure promise built, And stain his Altars with this bloody guilt. No, no, my Ioy, my Boy thrice-happy born (Yea, more then so, if furious I, forlorn, Hurt not thy Hap) a Father shalt thou be Of happy People that shall spring from thee. Fear not (dear Childe) that I, vnnaturall, Should in thy blood imbrue my hand at all: Or by th'exploit of such detested deed Commend my name to them that shall succeed. I will, the Fame that of my name shall ring In time to com, shall flee with fairer wing. The lofty Pine, that's shaken to and fro Simile. With Counter-pufs of sundry windes that blowe, Now, swaying South-wards, tears som root in twain, Then, bending North-wards, doth another strain, Reels vp and down, tost by two Tyrants fell, Would fall, but cannot; neither yet can tell (Inconstant Neuter, that to both doth yield) Which of the two is like to win the Field: So Abraham, on each side set-vpon Betwixt his Faith and his Affection; One while his Faith, anon Affection swaies: Now wins Religion, anon Reason waighs: Hee's now a fond, and then a faithfull, Father: Now resolute, anon relenting rather. One while the Flesh hath got the vpper hand: Anon the Spirit the same doth countermand. Hee's loth (alas!) his tender Son to kill; But much more loth to break His Fathers will. For thus (at last) He saith, now sure I knowe, 'T is God, 't is God; the God that loves me so, Loves, keeps, sustains: whom I so oft haue seen: Whose voice so often hath my comfort been. Illuding Satan cannot shine so bright, Though Angelliz'd: No, 't is my God of Might. Now feel I in my Soule (to strength and stir-it) The sacred Motions of his sacred Spirit. God, this sad Sacrifice requires of me; Hap what hap may, I must obedient be. The sable Night dis-lodg'd: and now began Aurora's Vsher with his windy Fan Gently to shake the Woods on every side, While his fair Mistress (like a stately Bride) With Flowrs, and Gems, and Indian Gold, doth spangle Her lovely locks, her Lovers looks to tangle; When, gliding through the Air in Mantle blew, With silver fring'd, she drops the Pearly deaw. With her goes Abram out; and the third day, Arrives on Cedrons Margents greenly-gay, Behoulds the sacred Hill, and with his Son (Loaden with sacred wood) he mounts anon. Anon, said Isaac; Father, heer I see Knife, fire and faggot, ready instantly: But wher's your Hoste? Oh! let vs mount, my Son, Said Abram: God will soon provide vs one. But, scant had Isaac turn'd his face from him A little faster the steep Mount to climb, Simile.Yer Abram changed cheer; and, as new Wine, Working a-new, in the new Cask (in fine) For beeing stopt too-soon, and wanting vent, Blowes-vp the Bung, or doth the vessell rent, Spews out a purple stream, the ground doth stain With Bacchus colour, where the Cask hath lain: So, now the Tears (which manly fortitude Did yerst as captive in the Brain include) At the dear names of Father and of Son, On his pale Cheeks in pearly drops did run: His eyes full vessels now began to leak: And thus th'old Hebrew muttering gan to speak In submiss voice, that Isaac might not hear His bitter grief, that he vnfoldeth heer. Sad spectacle! O now my hap-less hand, Thou whetst a sword, and thou doost teend a brand, The brand shall burn my heart, the sword's keen blade Shall my bloods blood, and my lifes life, invade: And thou, poor Isaac, bearest on thy back Wood that shall make thy tender flesh to crack; And yeeld'st thee, (more for mine than thine amiss) Both Priest and Beast of one same Sacrifice. O hap-less Son! O more then hap-less Sire! Most wicked wretch! O what mis-fortune dire In-gulfs vs heer! where miserable I, To be true godly, must Gods law deny: To be true faithfull, must my faith transgress: To be Gods Son, I must be nothing less Than Isaacs Sire: and Isaac (for my sake) Must, Soil, and Sire, and Life, and all, forsake. Yet on he goes, and soon surmounts the Mount; And, steel'd by Faith, he cheers his mournfull Front: (Much like the Delian Princess, when her Grace. In Thetis Waves hath lately washt her face) He builds his Altar, layes his wood ther-on, And tenderly bindes his dear Son anon. Father, said Isaac, Father, Father dear (What? do you turn away, as loth to hear?) O Father, tell me, tell me what you mean: O cruelty vn-knowen! Is this the mean Wherby my loins (as promised long since-is) Shall make you Grand-sire of so many Princes? And shall I (glorious) if I heer do dy, Fill Earth with Kings, with shining Stars the Sky? Back, Phœbus: blush, go hide thy golden head: Retire thy Coach to Thetis watery Bed: See not this savage sight. Shall Abraham's minde Be milde to all, and to his Son vn-kinde! And shall great Abram do the damned deed That Lyons, Tigers, Boars, and Bears would dread! See how (incenst) he stops his ear to me, As dreaming still on's bloody Mystery. Lord, how precise! see how the Paricide Seems to make conscience in less sins to slide: And he, that means to murder me (his Son) Is scrupulous in smaller faults to run. Yet (Father) hear me; not that I desire With sugred words to quench your Angers fire: In God's Name reap the Grain your self have sowen; Com take my life, extracted from your owne, Glut with my blood your blade, if you it please That I must dy; welcom my death (mine ease): But, tell me yet my fault (before I dy) That hath deserv'd a punishment so high. Say (Father) have I not conspir'd your death? Or, with strong poyson sought to stop your breath? Have I devis'd to short my Mother's life? Or, with your Foes ta'en part in any strife? O thou Æthereall Palace Crystalline (Gods highest Court) If in this heart of mine So damned thoughts had ever any place, Shut-vp for ever all thy Gates of Grace Against my Soule; and suffer not, that I Among thy winged Messengers do fly. If none of these, Abram (for I no more Dare call thee Father) tell me further-more What rests besides, that damned I have don, To make a Father Butcher of his Son? In memory, that fault I fain would have, That (after God's) I might your pardon crave For such offence; and so, th'Attonement driven, You live content, that I may dy forgiven. My Son, said He, thou art not hither brought By my fell fury, nor thine owne foul fault: God (our God) calls thee, and He will not let A Pagan sword in thy dear blood be wet; Nor burning plague, nor any pining pain With Languor turn thy flesh to dust againe: But Sacrifiç'd to him (for sweet perfume) Will have thee heer within this fire consume. What? Fears my Love, my Life, my Gem, my Ioy? What God commands, his servants must obey, Without consulting with frail Flesh and Blood, How he his promise will in time make good: How he will make so many Scepters spring From thy dead dust: How He (All-wise) will bring, In his due season, from thy sense-less Thighs, The glorious Son of righteousnes to rise, Who shall the Mountains bruise with yron Mace, Rule Heav'n and Earth, and the Infernall place. For he that (past the course of Natures kinde) First gave thee birth, can with his sacred Winde Raise thee again out of the lowest dust. Ten-thousand means he hath to save the Iust: His glorious wisdom guides the worlds society With equall Reans of Power and of Piety. Mine own sweet Isaac, dearest of my seed (Too-sweet, alas! the more my grief doth bleed, The more my loss; the more, with ease-less anguish, My vexed Bowels for thy lack shall languish) Adieu, dear Son (no longer mine, but His Who calls thee hence) let this vnhappy kiss Be the sad seal of a more sad Fare-well Then wit can paint, or words have powr to tell. Sith God commands, and (Father) you require To have it so, com Death (no longer dire, But glorious now) com gentle death, dispatch: The Heav'ns are open, God his arms doth reach T'imbrace my Soule: O! let me bravely fly To meet my Lord, and Deaths proud darts defie. What, Father? weep you now? Ah! cease those showrs: Weep not for me; for I no more am yours: I was the Lords yer I was born, you knowe; And he but lent me for a while to you: Will you recoil, and (Coward) lose the Crown So neer your head, to heap you with renown? Shall we so dare to dally with the Lord? To cast his yoak, and to contemn his Word? Where shall we fly his hand? Heav'n is his Throne: The Earth his foot-stool: and dark Acheron (The Dungeon where the damned soules be shut) Is of his anger evermore the But. On him alone all our good hap depends: And he alone from dangers vs defends. Ah! weep no more: This sacred Turf doth crave More blood then tears: let's so our selves behave, That, ioyn'd in zeal, we yeeld vs willingly To make a vertue of necessity. Let's testifie, we have a time abod; I, in your School; you, in the School of God: Where we have learned, that his sacred Word (Which made of Nothing all that ever stirr'd; Which all sustains, and all directeth still) To divers ends conducts the good and ill. Who loves not God more then all Kinn's respect, Deserves no place among his dear Elect: And who doth once God's Tillage vnder-take, Must not look back, neither his Plough forsake. Heer-with, th'old Hebrew cheerfuller becam, And (to himself) cries, Courage Abraham: The World, the Flesh, Adam, are dead in thee: God, Spirit, and Faith, alone subsisting be. Lord, by thy Spirit vnto my spirit annex So lively Faith, that still mine eyes may fix On thy true Isaac, whose sharp (sin-less) Suffering Shall purge from Sin me and my sinfull offering. Scarce had he drawn his sword (in resolution) With heaved hand for instant execution, When instantly the thundring Voice of God Staid heart and hand, and thus the Fact forbod; Abram, enough: hould, hould thy hand (said he) Put-vp thy sword; thine Isaac shall not dy: Now, of thy Faith I have had perfect proof; Thy Will for Deed I do accept: Enough. Glad Abram, then, to God gives thanks and praise, Vnbindes his Son, and in his room he laies A Lamb (there strangely hampered by the head) And that, to God, devoutly offered. Renowned Abraham, Thy noble Acts Excell the Fictions of Heroïk Facts: And, that pure Law a Son of thine should write, Shall nothing-else but thy brave deeds recite. Extoll who list thy wisdoms excellence, Victorious Valour, frank Beneficence, And Iustice too (which even the Gentiles honor): Ill dares my Muse take such a task vpon-her. Onely thy Faith (not all, with all th'effects) Onely one fruit of thousand she selects, For glorious subiect: which (to say the right) I rather love to wonder-at, then write. Go Pagans, turn, turn-over every Book: Through all Memorials of your Martyrs look: Collect a Scroule of all the Children slain On th'Altars of your gods: dig-vp again Your lying Legends: Run through every Temple: Among your Offerings choose the best example (Among your Offerings which your Fathers past Have made, to make their names eternall last) Among them all (fondlings) you shall not finde Such an example, where (vnkindely-kinde) Father and Son so mutually agree To shewe themselves, Father nor Son to be: Where man's deep zeal, and God's dear fauour, strove For Counter-conquest in officious love. One, by constraint his Son doth sacrifice: Another means his Name t'immortalize By such a Fact: Another hopes to shun Som dismall Plague, or dire Affliction: Another, onely that he may conform To (Tyrant) Custom's, aw-less, law-less Form, Which blears our eys, and blurs our senses so, That Lady Reason must her seat forgo: Yea, blindes the iudgement of the World so far, That Vertue's oft arraign'd at Vice's Bar. But, vn-constrain'd, our Abram, all alone, Vpon a Mountain, to the guise of none (For, it was odious to the Iews to doo) And in a time of Peace and Plenty too, Fights against Nature (prickt with wondrous zeal) And, slaying Isaac, wars against his Weal. O sacred Muse! that, on the double Mount, With withering Baies bind'st not thy Singers Front; But, on Mount Sion in the Angels Quire, With Crowns of glory doost their brows attire; Tell (for, thou know'st) what sacred Mystery Vnder this shadow doth in secret ly? O Death, Sin, Satan, tremble ye not all, For hate and horror of your dreadfull Fall So lively figur'd? To behold Gods Bowe So ready bent to cleave your heart in two? To see yong Isaac, Pattern of that Prince Who shall, Sin Satan, Death and Hell, convince? Both onely Sons, both sacred Potentates, Both holy Founders of two mighty States, Both sanctified, both Saints Progenitors, Both bear their Cross, both Lamb-like Sufferers, Both bound, both blame-less, both without reply, Both by their Fathers are ordain'd to dy Vpon Mount Sion: which high glorious Mount Serves vs for Ladder to the Heav'ns to mount, Restores vs Edens key (the key of Eden, Lost through the eating of the fruit forbidden, By wretched Adam, and his weaker Wife) And blessed bears the holy Tree of life. Christ dies indeed: but Isaac is repriv'd (Because Heav'ns Councell otherwise contriv'd) For, Isaac's blood was no sufficient price To ransom soules from Hell to Paradise: The Leprosie of our contagious sin More powr-full Rivers must be purged in. FINIS. The Lavve. THE THIRD PART OF THE THIRD DAY OF THE II. WEEK. The Argvment. Envy, in Pharao, seeks to stop the Cause Of Iews increase: Moses escapes his claws; Out of a Burning (vnburnt) Bush, a Voice For Iacob's Rescue doth of Him make choice; Sends him (with Aaron) to th'Egyptian King: His Hardning, Plagving, finall Ruining In the Red Sea. Israel ingrate for all: Christ-Typing Manna, Quails, Rock-waters fall: The glorious Lavve: the golden Calf: strange Fire: Core in-gulft: Moses prepar'd t'expire. Arm-arming Trumpets, lofty Clarions, Rock-batt'ring Bumbards, Valour-murdering Guns, Think you to drown with horror of your Noise The choice sweet accents of my sacred Voice? Blowe (till you burst) roar, rend the Earth in sunder; Fill all with Fury, Tempest, War and Thunder, Dire Instruments of Death, in vain yee toil: For, the loud Cornet of my long-breath'd stile Out-shrills yee still; and my Stentorian Song, With warbled Ecchoes of a silver tongue, Shall brim be heard from India even to Spain, And then from thence even to the Artik Wain. Yet, 't is not I, not I in any sort; My side's too-weak, alas! my breath's too-short It is the spirit-inspiring Spirit, which yerst On th'eldest Waters mildely moved first, That furnishes and fills with sacred winde The weak, dull Organs of my Muse and minde. So, still, good Lord, in these tumultuous times, Giue Peace vnto my Soule, soule to my Rimes: Let me not faint amid so faire a course: Let the World's end be th'end of my Discourse: And, while in France fell Mars doth all devour, In lofty stile (Lord) let me sing thy Powr. All-Changing Time had cancell'd and supprest Ioseph's Deserts: his Master was deceast, His Sons were dead; when currish Envie's strife Lays each-where ambush for poor Israel's life: Who, notwithstanding, doth far faster spread Comparison. And thicker spring, than, in a fruitfull Mead Moted with Brooks, the many-leaved locks Of thriving Charvel; which the bleating Flocks Can with their daily hunger hardly mowe So much as daily doth still newly growe. This Monster wuns not in the Cel she wont, Description of the Palace of Envy. Sh' hath rear'd her Palace on the steepest Mount, Whose snowy shoulders with their stony pride Eternally do Spain from France divide: It hath a thousand loop-holes every-way; Yet never enters there one sunny ray: Or if that any chance so far to pass, 'Tis quickly quenched by her cloudy face: At euery Loop, the Work-man wittily Hath plaç't a long, wide, hollow Trunk, wher-by Prattling Renowne and Fame with painted wing, News from all corners of the World do bring, Buzzing there-in: as, in a Sommer Even, Simile. From clefts of Medows that the Heat hath riven, The Grass-hoppers, seeming to fain the voyces Of little Birds, chirp-out ten thousand noyses. It frotun'd now that a swift-flying Fame, To whom Fame reports Israels prosperity. Which (lately but) from stately Memphis came, Sweating, and dusty, and nigh breath-less, fills With this Report one of her listening Quills: O curious Nymph (lives there a Wit with vs, Acute and quick, that is not curious?) Most wakefull Goddess, Queen of mortall hearts, Consort of Honor, Wealth, and High-Deserts, Doo'st thou not knowe, that happy Israel (Which promiseth, the Conqueror of Hell, That twice-borne King, here-after to bring-forth, Who dead shall liue again; and by his Worth Wipe-out Man's Forfait, and God's Law fulfill, And on his Cross th'envy of Envy kill) Doth (even in sight) abundantly increase? That Heav'n and Earth conspire his happiness? That seaventy Exiles, with vn-hallowed Frie Couer the face of all the World well-nigh? And, drunk with wealth, waigh not thy force a iot? Envie, thou seest it, but fore-seest it not. Envy incenseth Pharaoh to oppress them.Swolne like a Toad, between her bleeding iaws Her hissing Serpents wriggling tails she chaws: And, hasting hence, in ISIS form she iets; A golden vessell in one hand she gets, In th'other a sweet Instrument; her hood Was Peacocks feathers mixt with Southernwood; A siluer crescent on her front she set, And in her bosom many a fostering teat: And, thus disguis'd, with pride and impudence She presses-in to the Bubastik Prince; Who, slumbring then on his vn-quiet Couch, With Israel's greatness was disturbed much: Then she (the while, squinting vpon the lustre Of the rich Rings which on his fingers glister; And, snuffing with a wrythed nose the Amber, The Musk and Civet that perfum'd the Chamber) 'Gan thus to greet him: Sleep'st thou? sleep'st thou, son? And see'st thou not thy self and thine vn-don; While cruell Snakes, which thy kinde brest did warm, Sting thee to death, with their vngratefull swarm? These Fugitiues, these out-casts do conspire. Against rich Egypt, and (ingrate) aspire With odious Yoak of bondage to debase The noble Pharaoh's, God's immortall Race. With these last words, into his brest she blowes A banefull ayr whose strength vnfeltly flowes Through all his veins; and, having gain'd his heart, Makes Reason stoop to Sense in every part: Simile.So th'Aspick pale (with too-right aim) doth spet On his bare face, that coms too neer to it, The froth that in her teeth to bane she turns; A drowzy bane, that inly creeps, and burns So secretly, that without sense of pain, Scar, wound, or swelling, soon the Partie's slain. What shall I farther say? This Sorrow's-Forge, This Rack of Kings, Care's fountain, Courtier's scourge, Envies two Twins.Besides her sable poyson, doth inspire With Hate and Fear the Princes fell desire. Hence-forth therefore, poor Israel hath no peace, Not one good day, no quiet nap, no ease; Still, still opprest, Tax vpon Tax arose, After Thefts, Threats, and after Threats com blowes. The silly wretches are compell'd som-while Slauery of the Israelites. To cut new chanels for the course of Nile: Somtimes som Cities ruins to repair Somtimes to build huge Castles in the air: Somtimes to mount the Parian Mountains higher In those proud Towrs that after-worlds admire; Those Towrs, whose tops the Heav'ns have terrified: Those Towrs, that scuse th'audacious Titan's pride (Those Towrs, vain Tokens of a vast expense; Tropheis of Wealth, Ambition's Monuments) To make with their owne sweat and blood their morter: To be at-once Brick-maker, Mason, Porter. They labour hard, eat little, sleeping less, No sooner layd, but thus their Task-lords press; Villains, to work: what? are ye growne so sloth? Wee'll make yee yeeld vs wax and hony both. In breefe, this Tyrant, with such servitude, Pharao his vain policy. Thought soone to waste the sacred multitude; Or, at the least, that overlayd with woe, Weakned with watching, worn with toyling so, They would in time becom less service-able In Venvs Battails, and for breed less able (Their spirits disperst, their bodies over-drid, And Cypris sap vn-duly qualified): But, when he saw this not succeed so well, But that the Lord still prosper'd Israel; Inhumane, he commands (on bloudy Pain) His cruell Edict against the male children. That all their male babes in their birth be slain: And that (because that charge had don no good) They should be cast, in Cairo's siluer Food. O Barbarisme, learned in Hel belowe! Those, that (alas!) nor steel nor stream do knowe, Must die of steel or stream: cruell Edicts! That, with the Infant's blood, the Mother's mix; That, Childe and Mother both at once cut-off; Him with the stroke, her with the griefe therof: With two-fould tears Iews greet their Native Heav'n: The day that brings them life their life hath reav'n. But, Iochebed would fain (if she had durst) Her deer son Moses secretly haue nourç't: Yet thinking better, her sweet Babe forgo, Than Childe and Parents both to hazard so, At length she layes it forth, in Rush-boat weaves-it, And to God's Mercy and the Flood's she leaves-it. Though Rudder-less, nor Pilot-less, this Boat Among the Reeds by the Floods side did float, And saues from wrack the future Legislator, Lighting in hands of the Kings gracious Daughter: His Daughter finding Moses exposed, causeth him to be princely brought vp.Who opening it, findes (which with ruth did strike-her) A lovely Babe (or little Angel liker) Which with a smile seem'd to implore the ayd And gentle pity of the Royall Mayd. Love, and the Graces, State and Maiesty, Seem round about the Infants facc to fly, And on his head seem'd (as it were) to shine Presagefull rayes of som-what more diuine. She takes him vp, and rears him royal-like; And, his quick Spirit, train'd in good Arts, is like 2 Similes.A wel breath'd Body, nimble, sound, and strong, That in the Dance-schoole needs not teaching long: Or a good Tree set in as good a soyl, Which growes a-pace, without the Husband's toyl. In time, he puts in Practice what he knowes; With curteous Mildeness, manly Courage showes: H'hath nothing vulgar: with great happiness, In choice discourse he doth his mind express; And as his Soul's-type his sweet tongue affoords, His gracefull Works confirm his gracious Words: His Vertues make him even the Empire's heir: So means the Prince; such is the peoples prayer. Gods prouidence in his preseruation.Thus 'while o're-whelmed with the rapid course Of Mischief's Torrent (and still fearing worse) Israel seems help-less and even hope-less too Of any help that Mortall hand can doo: And, while the then-Time's hideous face and form Boads them (alas!) nothing but wrack and storm, Their Castor shines, their Saviour's sav'd: and Hee That with high hand shall them from bondage free, Scourging with Plagues, scarring with endless shame Th'Egyptian Court, is raised by the same. For, though him there they as a God adore, Moses affection &amp; duty toward his Parents and care of his Brethren. He scorns not yet his friends and kinred poor: He feels their Yoak, their mournings he laments: His word and sword are prest in their defence; And, as ordain'd for their Deliverance, And sent express by Heav'ns pre-ordinance, Seeing a Pagan (a proud Infidell, A Patagon, that tasted nought so well As Israel's blood) to ill-intreat a Iew, Him bold incounters, and him bravely slew. He flies out of Egypt.But, fearing then lest his inhumane Prince Should hear of it, young Moses flyes from thence: And, hard by Horeb, keeping Iethro's sheep, He Fasts and Prayes; with Meditations deep His vertuous zeal he kindles more and more, And prudently he lays-vp long-before Within his Soule (his spirituall Armory) All sacred Weapons of Sobriety, Where-with t'incounter, conquer, and suppress All Insurections of Voluptuousness. Also, not seldom some deep Dream or Transe God talketh to him in the Wilderness. Him suddainly doth even to Heav'n advance: And Hee, that whilom could not finde the Lord On plentious shoars of the Pelusian Foord, In walled Cities with their Towred Ports, In learned Colledges, nor sumptuous Courts; In Desart meets him; greets him face to face, And on his brows bears tokens of his Grace. For, while he past his sacred Prentiship Moses vision of the flaming bush. (In Wilderness) of th'Hebrews Shepheardship; In driving forth to kiss-cloud Sina's foot His fleecy Flock, and there attending too't, He suddain sees a Bush to flame and fume, And all a-fire, yet not at all consume; It flames and burns not, cracks and breaks not in, Kisses, but bites not, no not even the skin: True figure of the Church, and speaking Signe Which seemeth thus to, of it selfe, define: What (Amram's son) Doth Iacob's bitter Teen Dismay thee so? Behould, this Haw-thorn green Is even an Image of thine Israel, Who in the Fire of his Afflictions fell Still flourishes, on each side hedged round. With prickly Thorns, his hatefull Foes to wound: This Fire doth seem the Spirit Omnipotent, Which burns the wicked, tries the Innocent: Who also addeth to the sacred Signe, The more to move him, his owne Word Divine. I AM I that I am, in me, for me, by me: The voice of the Lord speaking out of the Bush. All Beings else Be not (or else vn-selfly be) But, from my Beeing, all their Beeing gather; Prince of the World, and of my Church the Father: Onely Beginning, Midst, and End of all; Yet sans Beginning, Midst, and End at all: All in my selfe compris'd, and all comprising That in the World was, is, or shall be rising: Base of this Vniverse: th'vniting Chain Of th'Elements: the Wisedom Soveraign: Each-where, in Essence, Powr and Providence; But in the Heav'ns, in my Magnificence: Fountain of Goodness: ever-shining Light: Perfectly Blest: the One, the Good, the Bright: Self-simple Act, working in frailest matter: Framer of Forms: of Substances Creator: And (to speak plainer) even that God I AM Whom so long since religious Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob, and their Progenies Haue worshipped and prays'd in humble wise. God hath pity on his People afflicted in Egypt.My sacred ears are tyred with the noyse Of thy poor Brethren's iust-complayning voyce: I haue beheld my Peoples burdens there; Moses, no more I will, nor can, forbear: Th'haue groan'd (alas!) and panted all too-long Vnder that Tyrants vn-relenting wrong. He ordaineth Moses for their Deliverer, &amp; giues him commission to goe to Pharao.Now, their Deliuerer I authorize thee, And make thee Captain of their Colony; A sacred Colony, to whom (as mine); I haue so oft bequeath'd rich Palestine. Therefore from me command thou Pharao That presently he let my People go Into the Dry-Arabian Wilderness, Where far from sight of all profane excess On a new Altar they may sacrifice To Me the Lord, in whom their succour lies: Haste, haste (I say)) and make me no excuse On thy Tongue's rudenes (for the want of vse) Nor on thy weaknes, nor vnworthiness To vnder-go so great a Business. What? cannot He, that made the lips and tongue, Prompt Eloquence and Art (as doth belong) Vnto his Legat? and, who every thing Of Nothing made, and All to nought shall bring; Th'Omnipotent, who doth confound (for His) By weak the strong; by what is not, what is, (That in his wondrous Iudgements, men may more The Work-man then the Instruments adore) Will he forsake, or leave him vn-assisted, That in his seruice duly hath insisted? Sith faithfull Servant, to do-well affected, Can by his Master never be reiected. Moses (accompanied with his brother Aaron) sets forward in his high Embassage.No sooner this, the Divine Voice had ended, And vp to Heav'n the Bushy Flame ascended, But Moses, with (his fellow in Commission) His Brother Aaron, wends with expedition First to his People, and to Pharao then, The King of Egypt (cruellest of Men): And inly filled with a zealous flame, Thus, thus he greets him, in th'Almighties name; Great Nilvs Lord, thus saith the Lord of Hoasts, Let go my People out of all the Coasts, Mine Israel (Pharao) forth-with release, Let them depart to Horeb's Wildernes; That vnto me, without offence or fear, Their Hearts and Heifers they may offer there. Base Fugitive, proud slaue (that art return'd Pharaos proud answere. Not to be whipt, but rather hangd, or burn'd) What Lord, said Pharao? ha! what Soveraign? O seaven-horn'd Nile! O hundred-pointed Plain! O City of the Sun! O Thebes! and Thou Renowned Pharos, do ye all not bow To vs alone? Are ye not onely Ours? Ours at a beck? Then, to what other Powrs Owes your great Pharao homage or respect? Or by what Lord to be controul'd and checkt? I see the Drift. These off-scums all at once Too idlely pampred, plot Rebellions: Sloth marrs the slaves; and vnder fair pretence Of new Religion (Traytours to their Prince) They Would Revolt. O Kings! how fond are we To think by Favours and by Clemency, To keep men in their duty! To be milde, Makes them be mad, proud, insolent and wilde: Too-much of Grace, our Scepters doth dis-grace, And smooths the path to Treason's plots a-pace. The dull Asse, numbers with his stripes his steps: Th'Ox, over-fat, too-strong, and resty, leaps About the Lands, casteth his yoak, and strikes; And waxen wilde, even at his Keeper kicks. The true Anatomy of a Tyrant. Well: to enioy a People, through their skin With scourges slyç't, must their bare bones be seen: We must still keep them short, and clip their wings, Pare neer their nails and pull out all their stings; Loade them with Tribute, and new Towle, and Tax, And Subsidies vntill we break their backs; Tire them with trauel, flay-them, pole-them, pil-them, Suck bloud and fat, then eat their flesh, and kil-them. 'Tis good for Princes to haue all things fat, Except their Subiects: but, beware of that. Ha, Miscreants! ha, rascal excrements, That lift your heel against your gracious Prince; Hence-forth you get of wood or straw no more, To burn your Bricks as you haue had before: Your selues shall seek it out; yet shall you still The number of your wonted task fulfill. I haue Commission from the King of Kings, Moses reply. Maker, Preseruer, Ruler, of all things, Replies the Hebrew that (to knowe the Lord) Thou feel his hand, vnless thou fear his word. In th'instant, Aaron on the slippery sand Aaron casteth down his Rod: which immediately turns into a Serpent. Casts down his Rod; and boldly thus began: So shall thy golden Scepter down be cast, So shall the Iudgements of the Lord at last (Now deemed dead) reviue, to daunt thy powr: So Israel shall Egypts wealth devour, If thou confess not God to be the Lord: If thou attend not, nor obserue his Word: And if his People thou do not release, To goe and serue him in the Wilderness. Before that Aaron this Discourse had done, A green-gold-azure had his Rod put-on, It glistered bright: and in a fashion strange, Into a Serpent it did wholly change; Crawling before the King, and all along Spetting and hissing with his forked tongue. The Magicians of Egypt counterfet that miracle, and bewitch the eyes of the King.The Memphian Sages then, and subtill Priests, T'vphold the Kingdom of their Osiris, Vpbraid them thus: Alas! is this the most Your God can do, of whom so much you boast? Are these his Wonders? Go, base Monte-banks, Go shew else-where your sleights and iuggling pranks. Such tricks may blear som vulgar innocents, But cannot blinde the Councell of a Prince; Who, by the gods instructed, doth contain All Arts perfection in his sacred brain. And, as they spake, out of their cursed hands They all let-fall their strange-inchanted Wands; Which instantly turn into Serpents too, Hissing and spetting, crawling to and fro. The King too much admires their cunning Charms: The place with Aspicks, Snakes and Serpents, swarms; Creeping about: as an ill-Huswife sees The Maggots creeping in a rotten Cheese. Simile.You, you are Iugglers, th'Hebrew then repli'd: You change not Nature, but the bare out-side; And your Enchantments onely doo transform The face of things, not the essentiall form. You, Sorcerers, so mock the Princes ey, And his Imagination damnifie, That common Sense to his externall, brings (By re-percussion) a false shape of things. My Rod's indeed a Serpent, not in showe, As heer in sight your selves by proof shall knowe. Immediately his Dragon rear'd his head, Rowl'd on his brest; his body wriggelled Somtimes aloft in length; somtimes it sunk Into it self, and altogether shrunk: It slides, it sups the air, it hisses fell, In steed of eyes two sparkling Rubies swell: And all his deadly baens, intrenched strong Within his trine Teeth and his triple Tongue, Call for the Combat: and (as greedy) set Moses rod-Serpent deuoureth the Serpents of the Egyptians. With sodain rage vpon those Counterfet, Those seeming-Serpents, and them all devour: Even as a Sturgeon, or a Pike, doth scour The Creeks and Pills in Rivers where they lie, Of smaller Fishes and their feeble Fry. But, at high Noon, the Tyrant wilfull-blind, Pharao and his people hardned: Therefore God plagued Egypt. And deafe to his owne good, is more inclin'd To Satans tools: the people, like the Prince, Prefer the Night before Light's excellence. Wherefore the Lord, such proud contempts to pay, Ten sundry plagues vpon their Land doth lay: Redoubling so his dread-full strokes, that there, Who would not love him milde, him rough should fear. Smiting the Waves with his Snake-wanded wood, 1. By turning their Waters into blood. Aaron anon converts the Nile to blood; So that the stream, from fruitfull Meroe, Runs red and bitter even vnto the Sea. The Court re-courst to Lakes, to Springs, and Brooks; Brooks, Springs, and Lakes had the like taste and looks: Then to the Ditches; but, even to the brink There flow'd (alas!) in steed of Water, Ink: Then, to the likeliest of such weeping ground Where, with the Rush, pipe-opening Fern is found: And there they dig for Water: but (alas!) The wounded soyl spets blood into their face. O iust-iust Iudgement! Those proud Tyrants fell, Those bloudy Foes of mourning Israel; Those that delighted, and had made their game In shedding blood, are forç't to drink the same: And those, that ruth-less had made Nile the slaughter Of th'Hebrew Babes, now die for want of Water. Anon, their Fields, Streets, Halls and Courts he loads 2. Covering their Land with Frogs. With foul great Frogs, and vgly croking Toads; Which to the tops of highest Towrs do clamber Even to the Presence, yea the priuy Chamber; As starry Lezards in the Sommer time Vpon the walls of broken houses clime. Yea; even the King meets them in every dish Of Privy-diet, be it Flesh or Fish: As at his Boord, so on his royall Bed; With stinking Frogs the silken quilts be spred. The Priests of Pharao seem to do the same: The Magicians counterfait the same, but their deceits are vain. Aaron alone in the Almighties Name, By Faith almighty: They for instruments Vse the black Legions of the Stygian Prince: He by his Wonders labours to make knowen The true Gods glory; onely they their owne: He seeks to teach; they to seduce awry: He studies to build vp; they to destroy: He, striking Strangers, doth His people spare; They spoile their own, but cannot hurt a hair Of the least Hebrew: they can onely wound; He hurts, and heals: He breaks, and maketh sound: And so, when Pharao doth him humbly pray, Re-cleers the Floods, and sends the Frogs away. The King eased of his punishm?t is again hardned.But (as in Heau'n there did no Iustice raign) The Kings repentance endeth with his pain. He is re-hardned: like a stubborn Boy That plies his Lesson (Hypocritely-coy) While in his hand his Master shakes the Rod; But, if he turn his back, doth flowt and nod. Therefore the Lord, this Day, with loathsom Lice Therefore 3. Aegypt is plagued with Lyce.Plagues poor and rich, the nastie and the nice, Both Man and beast; For, Aaron with his wand Turns into Lice the dust of all the Land. The morrow after, with huge swarms of Flies, 4. With Flies &amp;c.. Hornets and Wasps, he hunts their Families From place to place, through Medows, Fens and Floods, Hills, Dales, and Desarts, hollow Caves and Woods. Tremble therfore (O Tyrants) tremble ay, Poor worms of Earth, proud Ashes, Dust and Clay: For, how (alas!) how will you make defence 'Gainst the tri-pointed wrathfull violence Of the drad dare, that flaming in his hand, Shall path to powder all that him withstand? And 'gainst the rage of flames eternal-frying, Where damned soules ly euer-neuer-dying: Sith the least Flies, and Lice, and Vermine too Out-braue your braues, and triumph ouer you. Man ca?not hide him from the hand of God, nor auoid his vengeance.Gallop to Anian, sail to Iucatan, Visit Botongas, diue beyond the Dane. Well may you fly, but not escape him there: Wretches, your halters still about, you bear. Th'Almighties hand is long, and busie still; Hauing escap't this Rod, his Sword you feel: He seems somtimes to sleep and suffer all; But calls at last for Vse and Principall: With hundred sorts of Shafts his Quiuer's full, Som passing keen, som som-what sharp, som dull, Som killing dead, som wounding deep, som light; But all of them do alwaies hit the White, Each after other. Now th'Omnipotence At Egypt shoots his shafts of Pestilence: Th'Ox falls-down in his yoak, Lambs bleating dy, 5. With the Plague of Pestilence. The Bullocks as they feed, Birds as they fly. Anon he couers Man and Beast with cores Of angry Biles, Botches, and Scabs, and Sores; 6. With Vlcers and grieuous Scabs or Murrain. Whose vlcerous venoms, all inflaming spread O're all the body from the foot to head. Then, Rain, and Hail, and flaming Fire among Spoyl all their fields: their Cattell great with young 7. With haile &amp; fire from heauen. All brain'd with hail-stones: Trees with tempest cleft, Robd of their boughs, their boughes of leaues berest. And, from Heav'ns rage, all, to seek shelter, glad; The Face of Egypt is now dradly-sad: The Söan Virgins tear their Beauties honour; Egyptians amazed at the extraordinary scourge. Not for the waste, so much, as for the manner. For, in that Country neuer see they Clowd, With waight of Snowes their trees are neuer bow'd, They know no Ice: and though they haue (as we) The Yeare intire, their Seasons are but three: They neither Rain-bowe, nor fat Deaws expect, Which from else-where Sol's thirsty rayes erect: Rain-less, their soyl is wet, and Clowd-less, fat; The naturall fruitfulness &amp; prosperity of Egypt in its selfe maruellous. Itself's moist bosom brings in this and that: For, while else-where the Riuer's roaring pride Is dryed-vp; and while that far and wide The Palestine seeks (for his thirsty Flock) Iordan in Iordan, Iabboc in Iabboc; Their floud o'reflowes, and parched Misraim A season seems in a rich Sea to swim, Niles billows beat on the high-dangling Date; And Boats do slide, where Ploughs did slice of late. Steep snowy Mounts, bright Stars Etesian gales, You cause it not: no, those are Dreams and Tales: Th'Eternall-Trine who made all compassly, Makes th'vnder waues, the vppers want supply; And, Egypts Womb to fill with fruits and Flowrs, Gives swelling Nile th'office of heauenly Showrs. Then the Thrice-Sacred with a sable Clowd Of horned Locusts doth the Sun be-clowd, And swarmeth down on the rebellious Coast The Grass-hoppers lean, dam-deuouring Hoast, 8 The are vexed with Grasshoppers. Which gleans what Hail had left, and (greedy) crops Both night and Day the Husband's whole-year's hopes. Then, gross thick Darkness over all he dight, And three fair Dayes turns to one fearfull Night: 9 Wih palpable darkness. With Ink-like Rheum the dull Mists drouzy vapours Quench their home Fires, and Temple-sacred Tapers. If hunger driue the Pagans from their dens, Ones 'gainst a settle breaketh both his shins; Another, groping vp and down for bread, Falls down the stayrs, and there he lies for dead. But, though these works surmount all Natures might, Though his owne Sages them of guile acquight, Though th'are not casuall (sith the holy-man The Israelites in all these plagues vntoucht, yet Pharao still hardned.Fore-tels perfixtly What, and Where and When) And though that (liuing in the midst of His) The Israelites be free from all of This, Th'incensed Tyrant (strangely obstinate) Retracts the Leave he granted them of late. For, th'Ever-One, who with a mighty hand Would bring his people to the plentious Land Of Palestine: Who prouidently-great, Before the eyes of all the World would set A Tragedy, where wicked Potentates Might see a Mirror of their owne estates: And, who (most-iust) must haue meet Arguments, To showe the height of his Omnipotence; Hardens the King, and blinding him (selfe-blinde) Leaues him to Lusts of his owne vicious minde. For, God doth neuer (euer purely bent) Came sin, as sin; but, as Sin's Punishment. 10. Therefore all the first borne of Egypt are slain in one night by the Angell.For, the last Charge, an Angell in one night, All the first born through all the Land doth smite; So that from Sues Port to Birdene Plain, Ther's not a House, but hath som body slain, Saue th'Israelites, whose doors were markt before, With sacred Pass-Lamb's sacramentall gore. And therfore euer-since on that same day, Yeerly, the Iewes a Yearling Lamb must stay; A token of that Passage, and a Type Of th'Holy-Lamb, which should (in season ripe) By powring-forth the pure and plentious Flood Of his most precious Water-mixed Blood, Preserue his People from the drad Destroyer, That fries the wicked in eternall fier. Through all the Land, all in one instant cry, All for one cause, though yet all know not why. Night heaps their horrors: and the morning showes Their priuat griefs, and makes them publike woes. After so many grieuous plagues the Egyptians cry out vpon their King to let the Israelites goe.Scarce did the glorious Gouernour of Day O're Menphis yet his golden tress display, When from all parts, the Maydens and the Mothers, Wiues, Husbands, Sons, and Sires, Sisters, and Brothers, Flock to the Court, where with one common voice They all cry-out, and make this mournfull noyse: O stubborn stomach! (cause of all our sadnes) Dull Constancy! or rather, desperat Madnes! A Flood of Mischiefs all the Land doth fill: The Heav'ns still thunder; th'Air doth threaten still: Death, ghastly death, triumpheth every-where, In every house; and yet, without all fear, Without all feeling, we despise the Rod, And scorn the Iudgements of the mighty God. Great King, no more bay with thy wilfullings His Wrath's dread Torrent. He is King of kings; And in his fight, the Greatest of you all Are but as Moats that in the Sun doo fall: Yeeld, yeeld (alas!) stoop to his powrfull threat; He's warn'd enough that hath been ten-times beat. Go, get you gon: hence, hence, vn-lucky Race; They hasten and importune them to be gon. Your eyes bewitch our eyes, your feet this Place, Your breath this air: Why haste you not away? Hebrews, what lets you? wherfore do you stay? Step to our houses (if that ought you lack) Choose what you like, and what you like go take, Gould, Plate, or Iewels, Ear-rings, Chains, or Ouches, Our Girdles, Bracelets, Carkanets, or Brouches, Bear them vnto your gods, not in the sands Where the Heav'n-kissing Cloud-brow'd Sina stands; But much, much farther; and so far, that heer We never more your odious news may hear: Go, Hebrews, go, in God's Name thrive amain; By losing you, we shall sufficient gain. With the Kings leave, then th'Hebrews Prince collects After their departure Pharao immediately pursves them. His Legions all, and to the Sea directs. Scarce were they gon, when Pharaoh doth retract, And arms all Egypt to go fetch them back; And, camping neer them, execrably-rude, Threatens them Death, or end-less Servitude. Even as a Duck, that nigh som crystall brook Simile. Hath twice or thrice by the same Hawk been strook, Hearing aloft her gingling silver bells, Quivers for fear, and looks for nothing else But when the Falcon (stooping thunder-like) With sudden souse her to the ground shall strike; And with the stroak, make on the sense-less ground The gut-less Quar, once, twice, or thrice, rebound: So Israel, fearing again to feel Pharaoh's fell hands, who hunts them at the heel, Quivers and shivers for despair and dread; And spets his gall against his godly Head. O base ambition! This false Politick, The Israelites fear, and murmur against Moses. Plotting to Great himself, our deaths doth seek: He mocks vs all, and makes vs (fortune-less) Change a rich Soil for a dry Wilderness; Allur'd with lustre of Religious showes, Poor soules, He sels vs to our hatefull Foes: For, O! what strength? alas! what stratagem? Or how (good God) shall we encounter them? Or who is it? or what is it shall save-vs From their fell hands that seek to slay, or slave-vs? Shall we, disarmed, with an Army fight? Can we (like Birds) with still-steep-rising flight Surmount these Mountains? have we Ships at hand To pass the Sea (this half a Sea, half sand)? Or, had we Ships, and Sails, and Owers, and Cable; Who knowes these Waters to be navigable? Alas! som of vs shall with Scithes be slasht; Som, with their Horse-feet all to peeces pasht; Som, thrill'd with Swords, or Shafts, through hundred holes Shall ghastly gasp out our vntimely soules. Sith die we must, then die we voluntary: Let's run, our selves, where others would vs carry; Com, Israelites, com, let vs dy together, Both men and women: so we shall (in either) Prevent their rage, content their avarice, And yeeld (perhaps) to Moses even his Wish. Moses instruction to enourage them, with assured confidence in God.Why, brethren? knowe ye not (their Ruler saith) That in his hand God holdeth life and death? That he turns Hils to Dales, and Seas to Sands? That he hath (prest) a thousand winged Bands T'assist his Children, and his Foes t'assail? And that he helps not, but when all helps fail? See you this mighty Hoast, this dreadfull Camp, Which dareth Heav'n, and seems the Earth to damp; And all inrag'd, already chargeth ours, Simile.As thick, or thicker then the Welkin pours His candi'd drops vpon the ears of Corn, Before that Ceres yellow locks be shorn? It all shall vanish, and of all this Crew (Which thinks already to have swallow'd you) Of all this Army, that (in Armour bright) Seems to out-shine the Sun, or shame his light; There shall to-morrow not a man remain: Therfore be still; God shall your side sustain. Calling vp? God he parts the Red Sea so that the people passe through as on dry land.Then (zealous) calling on th'immortall God, He smote the Sea with his dead-living Rod: The Sea obay'd, as bay'd: the Waves, controul'd, Each vpon other vp to Heav'n do fould: Between both sides a broad deep Trench is cast, Dri'd to the bottom with an instant blast: Or rather, 't is a Valley paved (else) With golden sands, with Pearl, and Nacre-shels, And on each side is flanked all along With wals of crystall, beautifull and strong. This flood-less Foord the Faithfull Legions pass, And all the way their shoo scarce moisted was. Dream we, said they? or is it true we try? The Sea start at a stick? The Water dry? The Deep a Path? Th'Ocean in th'Air suspending? Bulwarks of Billows, and no drop descending? Two Wals of Glass, built with a word alone? Afrik and Asia to conioyn in one? Th'all-seeing Sun new bottoms to behould? Children to run where Tunnies lately roul'd? Th'Egyptian Troops pursue them by the track; The Egyptians following them are swallowed in the Sea. Yet waits the patient Sea, and still stands back; Till all the Hoast be marching in their ranks Within the lane between his crystall banks. But, as a wall, weakned with mining-vnder, Simile. The Piles consum'd fall suddenly asunder, O'r-whelmeth all that stand too neer the breach, And with his Ruines fills-vp all the ditch: Even so God's finger, which these Waters bay'd; Beeing with-drawn, the Ocean swell'd and sway'd; And, re-conioyning his congealed Flood, Swallows in th'instant all those Tyrants wood. Heer, one by swimming thinks himself to save: But, with his scarf tangled about a Nave, He's strangled straight; and, to the bottom sinking, Dies; not of too-much drink, but for not drinking; While that (in vain) another with lowd lashes Scours his prowd Coursers through the scarlet Washes: The streams (whereon more Deaths then Waves do swim) Bury his Chariot; and his Chariot, him: Another, swallowed in a Whirl-Whales womb, Is laid a-live within a living Toomb: Another, seeing his Twin-brother drowning; Out of his Coach, his hand (to help him) downing; With both his hands grasping that hand, his Twin Vnto the bottom hales him head-long in; And instantly the water covers either: Right Twins indeed; born, bred and dead, together. Nile's stubborn Monarch, stately drawn vpon Pharao profanely blaspheming &amp; proudly braving Moses and the Sea, is notwithstanding drowned with the rest. A curious Chariot, 'chaç't with pearl and stone, By two proud Coursers, passing snowe for colour; For strength, the Elephants; Lions, for valour; Curseth the Heav'ns, the Air, the Windes and Waves; And, marching vp-ward, still blaspheams and braves: Heer, a huge Billow on his Targe doth split; Then coms a bigger, and a bigger yet, To second those: The Sea growes ghastly great; Yet stoutly still he thus doth dare and threat: Base roaguing Iuggler, think'st thou with thy Charms Thou shalt preuail against our puissant arms? Think'st thou, poor shifter, with thy Hel-spels thus To cross our Counsels, and discomfit Vs? And, O proud Sea! false, traiterous Sea, dar'st thou, Dar'st thou conspire 'gainst thine own Neptune now? Dar'st thou presume 'gainst Vs to rise and roar? I charge thee cease: be still, I say: no more: Or, I shall clip thine arms in Marble stocks, And yoak thy shoulders with a Bridge of Rocks; Or banish thee from Etham far, for ay, Through som new Chanell to go seek thy way. Heer-at the Ocean, more than ever, frets, All topsie-turvy vp-side-down it sets; And a black billow, that aloft doth float With salt and sand; stops his blaspheamous throat. What now betides the Tyrant? Waters now Have reft his neck, his chin, cheeks, eyes and brow, His front, his fore-top: now ther's nothing seen But his proud arm, shaking his Fauchin keen: Wherewith he seems, in spite of Heav'n and Hell, To fight with Death, and menace Israel. At last he sinks all vnder water quite, Spurning the sand: again he springs vpright; But, from so deep a bottom to the top, So clogg'd with arms, can cleave no passage vp: Simile.As the poor Partridge, cover'd with the net, In vain doth strive, struggle, and bate, and beat; For, the close meshes, and the Fowler's craft, Suffer the same no more to whurre aloft. I to your selves leave to conceive the ioy Of Iacob's heirs thus rescu'd from annoy; Seeing the Sea to take their cause in hand, And their dead Foes shuffled vpon the sand; Their shields, and staves, and chariots (all-to-tore) Floating about, and flung vpon the shoar: When thus th'Almighty (glorious God most high) For them without them, got the Victory, They skip and dance; and, marrying all their voices To Timbrels, Hawboys, and loud Cornets noises, Make all the shoars resound, and all the coasts, 2. Part of this Tract: where is discoursed of the estate of the people of Israel in the Wlderness, vntill the death of Moses.With the shrill Praises of the Lord of Hoasts. Eternall issue of eternall Sire, Deep Wisdom of the Father, now inspire And shew the sequell that from hence befell, And how he dealt with his dear Israel, Amid the Desart, in their Pilgrimage Towards the Promis'd plentious Heritage: Tell, for (I knowe) thou know'st: for, compast ay With Fire by Night, and with a Cloud by Day, Thou (my soule's hope) wert their sole Guide and Guard, Their Meat and Drink in all their Iourney hard. Marching amid the Desart, nought they lack: Heav'n still distils an Ocean (for their sake) Of end-less good: and every Morn doth send Sufficient food for all the day to spend. When the Sun riseth, and doth haste his Race (Half ours, half theirs that vnderneath vs pase) To re-behould the beauty, number, order, And prudent Rule (preventing all mis-order) Of th'awfull Hoast lodg'd in the Wilderness, So favour'd by the Sun of Righteousnes; Each coms but forth his Tent, and at his dore Findes his bread ready (without seeking more): A pleasant bread, which from his plentious clowd, Like little Hail, Heav'ns wakefull Steward strow'd. The yellow sands of Elim's ample Plain God gives them Manna. Were heaped all with a white sugred grain, Sweet Corianders; Iunkets, not to feed This Hoast alone, but even a World (for need). Each hath his part, and every one is fed With the sweet morsels of an vn-bought bread. It never rains for a whole yeer at-once, It is given from day to day. But daily for a day's provisions: To th'end, so great an Hoast, so curbed straight, Still on the Lord's wide open hand should wait, And every Dawning have due cause to call On him their Founder, and the Fount of all: Each, for his portion hath an Omer-full; The sur-plus rots, mould, knead it how they will. The Holy-One (iust Arbitrer of wrong) Allows no less vnto the weak, than strong: On Sabbath's Eve, he lets sufficient fall To serve for that day, and the next withall; That on his Rest, the sacred Folk may gather, Not Bodie's meat, but spirituall Manna rather. Thou, that from Heav'n thy daily White-bread hast, Thou, for whom Harvest all the yeer doth last, That in poor Desarts rich aboundance heap'st, That sweat-less eat'st, and without sowing reap'st, That hast the Air for farm, and Heav'n for field (Which, sagred Mel, or melled sugar yeeld) That, for taste changing doost not change thy cheer, God's Pensioner, and Angel's Table-peer: It is a liuely figure of Christ the true bread of life.O Israel! see in this Table-pure, In this fair glass, thy Saviour's pourtraiture, The Son of God, Messias promised, The sacred seed, to bruize the Serpents head: The glorious Prince, whose Scepter ever shines, Whose Kingdom's scope the Heav'n of Heav'ns confines; And, when He shall (to light thy sin-full load) Put Man-hood on, dis-knowe him not for God. The same demonstrated by particular conscience.This Grain is small, but full of substance though: Christ strong in working, though but weak in showe. Manna is sweet: Christ as the Hony-Comb. Manna from high: and Christ from Heav'n doth come. With that, there falls a pleasant pearly deaw: Christ coming down doth all the Earth be-streaw With spiritual gifts. That, vnto great and small, Tastes to their tastes: and Christ is all to all: (Food to the hungry, to the needy wealth, Ioy to th'afflicted, to the sickly health, Pardon to those Repent, Prop to the bow'd, Life's sauour to the Meek, Death's to the Prowd). That's common good: and Christ communicate. That's purely white: and Christ immaculate. That gluts the wanton Hebrews (at the last) Christ and his Word the World doth soon distaste. Of that, they eat no less that have one measure, Than who have hundred: and in Christ his treasure Of Divine Grace, the faith-full Proselyte Hath no less part, than Doctors (deep of sight). That's round: Christ simple, and sincerely-round. That in the Ark: Christ in his Church is found. That doth (with certain) stinking worms becom: Christ th'Ever-Word) is scandall vnto som. That raineth not, but on the sacred Race: Christ to his Chosen doth confine his Grace. That's broken, every Grain: Christ (Lamb of God) Vpon his Cross-press is so torn and trod, That of his Blood the pretious Flood hath purl'd Down from Mount Sion over all the World. The people lust for flesh.Yet glutted now with this ambrosiall Food, This Heav'nly bread, so holy and so good, Th'Hebrews do lust for flesh: a fresh South-winde Brings shoals of Fowls to satisfie their minde; God sends them Quails.A cloud of Quails on all the Camp is sent, And every one may take to his content: For, in the Hoast, and all the Country by, For a day's-iourney, Cubit-thick they ly. But, though their Commons be thus delicate, Although their eyes can scarce look out for fat, Although their Bellies strout with too-much meat, Though (Epicures) they vomit as they eat, Yet still they howl for hunger; and they long They long for the Garlick &amp; Onions of Egypt. For Memphian hotch-potch, Leeks, and Garlick strong: As Childe-great Women, or green Maids (that miss Simile. Their Terms appointed for their florishes) Pine at a Princely feast, preferring far, Red-Herrings, Rashers, and (som) sops in Tar; Yea, coals, and clowts, sticks, stalks, and dirt, before Quail, Pheasant, Partridge, and a hundred more: So, their fantastick wearisom disease Distastes their tastes, and makes them strange to please. But, when the Bull, that lately tost his horn In wanton Pride, hangs down his head, forlorn For lack of Water, and the Souldier bleak Growes (without Arms) for his own waight too-weak: When fiery Thirst through all their veins so fierce Consumes their blood, into their bones doth pearce, Sups-vp their vitall humour, and doth dry Their whilom-beauties to Anatomy; They weep and wail, and but their voice (alas!) Is choakt already that it cannot pass Through the rough Straights of heir dry throats; they would They murmur for want of water, with grieuous imputation to their good Guide. Roar-out their grief, that all men hear them should. O Duke! (no Hebrew, but an Ethnick rather) Is this (alas!) the guerdon that we gather For all the service thou hast had of vs? What have we don, that thou betray'st vs thus? For our obedience, shall we evermore With Fear and Want be hanted at our door? O windy words! O periur'd promises! O gloze, to gull our honest simpleness! Escap't from Hunger, Thirst doth cut our throat: Past the Red-Sea, heer vp and down we float On firm-less sands of this vast Desart heer, Where, to and fro we wander many a yeer: Looking for Liberty, we finde not Life; No, neither Death (the welcom end of strife) Envy not vs, dear Babes: we envy you, You happy ones, whom Egypt's Tyrant slue; Your Birth and Death cam hand in hand together, Your end was quick nay't was an Entry rather To end-less Life: We wretches, with our age Increase our Woes in this long Pilgrimage: We hope no Harbour where we may take breath: And Life to vs is a continuall Death. You blessed live, and see th'Almighties face: Our Daies begin in tears, in toils they pass, And end in dolours (this is all we doo): But Death concludes tears, toils, and dolours too. Moses reproues them, &amp; smites the Rock, from whence issues plenty of water.Stiff-necked People, stubborn Generation, Egypt doth witnes (in a wondrous fashion) God's goodnes (to thee): all the Elements Expound vnto thee his Omnipotence: And doost thou murmur still? and dar'st thou yet Blaspheam his promise, and discredit it? Said Moses then; and gave a sudden knock With his dear Scepter on a mighty Rock: From top to toe it shakes, and splits with-all, And wel-nigh half vnto the ground doth fall, As smit with Lightning: then, with rapid rush, Out of the stone a plentious stream doth gush, Which murmurs through the Plain; proud, that his glass, Gliding so swift, so soon re-yongs the grass; And, to be gaz'd-on by the wanton Sun, And through new paths so brave a course to run. Simile.Who hath not seen (far vp within the Land) A shoal of Geese on the dry-Sommer sand In their hoarse language (somtimes lowely-lowd) Suing for succour to som moist-full clowd; How, when the Rain descends, their wings they beat, (With the first drops to cool their swelting heat) Bib with their Bill, bouz with their throats, and suck, And twenty-times vnto the bottom duck? Such th'Hebrews glee: one, stooping down, doth sup The clear quick stream; another takes it vp In his bare hand; another in his hat; This, in his buskin; in a bucket, that (Well fresht himself) bears fom vnto his Flock; This fils his pitcher-full; and that, his Crock: And other-som (whose Thirst is more extream) Like Frogs ly paddling in the crystall stream. They march toward Mount Sina, where god deliuereth them his LAW.From Rephidim, along the Desart Coast, Now to Mount Sina marcheth all the Hoast; Where, th'everlasting God, in glorious wonder, With dreadfull voice his fearfull Lavv doth thunder; To showe, that His rev'rend, Divine Decrees (Wherto all hearts should bow, and bend all knees) Proceed not from a Politick Pretence, A wretched Kingling, or a petty Prince (Nymph-prompted Nvma, or the Spartans Lord, Or him that did Cecropian strifes accord) Nor from the mouth of any mortall man; But from that King, who at his pleasure can Shake Heav'n, and Earth, and Air, and all therin: That Israel shall finde him (if they sin) As terrible with Vengeance in his hand, As dreadfull now in giving the Command: And, that the Text of that drad Testament, Grav'n in two Tables for vs impotent, Hath in the same a sadder load compriz'd, And heavier yoak, then is the yoak of Christ. That, that doth showe vs Sin, threats, wounds and kils: This offers Grace, Balm in our sores distils. Redoubled Lightnings dazle th'Hebrews eies; With what dreadfull Majesty it was delivered. Cloud-sund'ring Thunder roars through Earth and Skies, Louder and louder in careers and cracks, And stately Sina's massie centre shakes, And turneth round, and on his sacred top A whirling flame round like a Ball doth wrap: Vnder his rocky ribs, in Coombs belowe, Rough-blust'ring Boreas, nurst with Riphean snowe, And blub-cheekt Avster, puft with fumes before, Met in the midst, iustling for room, do roar: A cloak of clouds, all thorough-lin'd with Thunder, Muffles the Mountain both aloft and vnder: On Pharan now no shining Pharvs showes. A Heav'nly Trump, a shrill Tantara blowes, The winged Windes, the Lightning's nimble flash, The smoaking storms, the whirl-fire's crackling clash, And deafning Thunders, with the same do sing (O wondrous consort!) th'everlasting King His glorious Wisdom, who doth give the Law To th'Heav'nly Troops, and keeps them all in aw. But, as in Battell we can hear no more Simile. Small Pistol-shot, when once the Canons roar: And as a Cornet soundeth cleer and rife Simile. Above the warbling of an Alman Fife; A dradder voice (yet a distincter voice) Whose sound doth drown all th'other former noise, Roars in the Vale, and on the sacred Hill, Which thrills the ears, but more the heart doth thrill Of trembling Iacob: who, all pale for fear, From God's own mouth these sacred words doth hear; Hark, Israel: O Iacob, hear my Law: Hear it, to keep it (and thy self in aw). I am IEHOVA, I (with mighty hand) Brought thee from bondage out of Egypt Land: Adore Me only for thy God and Lord, The Decalogue. With all thy heart, in every Deed and Word. Make thee none Image (not of any sort) To thy own Works My Glory to transport. Vse not my Name without respect and fear, Never Blaspheam, neither thy self for-swear. Six days vvork for thy food: but then (as I) Rest on the Seaventh, and to my Temple hy. To those that gave thee life, due Reverence give, If thou desire long in the Land to live. Imbrve thou not thy hand in hvmane blood. Stain not anothers bed. Steal no mans good. Bear no false vvitnes. Covet not to have Thy Neighbours Wife, his Oxe, his Asse, his Slave, His House, his Land, his Cattell, or his Coin, His Place, his Grace, or ought that is not Thine. The excellency of the Law of God.Eternall Tutor, O Rule truely right Of our frail life! our foot-steps Lanthorn bright: O Soule's sweet Rest! O biting curb of Sin! Which Bad despise, the Good take pleasure in: Reverend Edicts vpon Mount Sina given, How-much-fould sense is in few words contriven! How wonder-full, and how exceeding far! How plain, how sacred, how profound you are! All Nations else, a thousand times (for cause) Have writ, and raç't, and chopt, and chang'd their Laws; Except the Iews: but they, although their State With every Moon almost did innovate (As somtimes having Kings, and somtimes none) In all their changes kept their Law still One. The inconstancy and vanity of Humane Lawes.What resteth at this day of Salaminian, Laconian Lavvs, or of the Carthaginian? Yea Rome, that made even all the World one City, So strong in Arms, and in States-Art so witty; Hath, in the Ruines of her Prides rich Babels, Left but a Relique of her Twice-Six-Tables. Stability and authority of the Law of God.But, since in Horeb the High-Thundring ONE Pronounç't This Law, three-thousand times the Sun Hath gallopt round Heav'ns golden Bandeleer, Imbost with Beasts, studded with stars so cleer: And yet one title hath not Time bereft; Although the People vnto whom 'twas left, Be now no People, but (expulst from home) Through all the corners of the World do roam: And though their State, through euerie Age almost, On a rough Sea of Mischiefs hath been tost. A Butt, a Brook, a Torrent doth confine All other Lawes: Megarian Discipline Hath nought of th'Attick: nor the Coronan Of Theban Rites: nor Thebes of Cadmean: But, this set Lavv, given Iacob's Generations, Is the true Law of Nature and of Nations, Which (sacred) sounds where-ever (to descry) Th'all-searching Sun doth cast his flaming ey. The Turks imbrace, the Christians honour it, And Iews with Fear do euen adore it yet. I only, I (Great God) thy Lavvs do spurn How all men transgresse the same at euery part. With my foul feet, I do thy Statutes scorn: Puft in my Soule with extream Pride, before, Nay in thy stead, I do my self Adore. I Serue no wooden gods, nor Kneel to Stones; But Couetous, I worship Golden ones. I Name thee not, but in vain Blasphemy, Or (Achab-like) in sad Hypocrisie. I Rest the Sabbath: yet I break thy Lavv, Seruing (for thee) mine idle Mouth and Maw. I Reuerence Superiors, but in showe; Not out of Loue, but as compelled so. I Murder none: yet doth my Tongue too-rife VVound others Fame, and my Hearts-hate their life. I Ciuilize, left that I seem Obscœne: But Lord (Thou know'st) I am Vnchast, vnclean. I seem no Theef: yet tempted with my Want, I take too oft the Fruit I did not plant. I speak not much: yet in my little Talk, Much Vanity, and many Lies do walk. I Wish too-earnest, and too-oft (in fine) For others Fortunes, male-content with mine. Heer lie I naked: lo th'Anatomie Remedy for all our sinnes. Of my foul Heart, O Humane-Deity! O Christ! th'Almightie's like All-mighty Word, O put-me-on Thy Robe! as whilom (Lord) Thou putst-on Mine: me in Thy Blood be-lave; And in my Soule thy sacred Lawes ingraue. While with the Duke, th'Eternall did deuise, And to his inward sight did modulize His Tabernacle's admirable Form, And prudently him (faithfull) did inform In a new Rubrick of the Rytes Diuine, To th'end the Heirs of promis'd Palestin After their fancy should not worship him, Nor (Idol-prone) example leading them, Into his sacred TEMPLE introduce The Sacrifices that the Heathen vse; But, by their Rytes to guide their spirituall eye To Christ, the Rock on whom their hopes should lie; Beholde (alas!) frail Aaron, Deputied In Moses absence Aaron makes the golden Calfe. During his absence, all the Flock to guide, Dumb coward Curr, barks not against their ill; But giuing way to the mad Peoples will, Casteth a Goulden Calf, and sets it vp, For them to worship, and vnto it stoop: Gold, Rings and Iewels, which the Lord of Heav'n Had (as Love-tokens) lately to them given, Are cast into a Mould; and (which is worse) Iacob, to wed a Calf, doth God divorce. Those Feet, that dry-shod past the Crimsin Gulf, Now dance (alas!) before a Molten Calf: That Voice, which late on Etham sands had rung Th'Almightie's glory, now to Satan sung. Moses sharply reproves Aaron, breaks the Idol, and punisheth the idolaters.The zealous Prophet, with iust fury moov'd, 'Fore all the Hoast, his Brother sharp reproov'd: And pulveriz'd their Idol; and eft soons, Flankt by olde Levie's most religious Sons, Throngs through the Camp, and each wher strowes his way With blood and slaughter, horror and dismay: Simile.As half a score of Reapers nimbly-neat, With cheerfull ey choosing a plot of Wheat, Reap it at pleasure, and of Ceres locks Make hand-fulls sheaves, and of their sheaves makes shocks; And through the Field from end to end do run, Working a-vie, till all be down and don. Simile.Or, as so many Canons shot at-once A front a Camp; th'Earth with the Thunder grones, Heer flees a broken arm, and breaks another; There stands th'one half of a halv'd body, th'other Falls-down a furlong thence: heer flees a shield; And deep-wide windows make they in the field. Aaron &amp; Mary (or Miriam) murmur against Moses.All these sure signes of God's dear estimate Cannot confirm the Hebrew Magistrate In his Authority: euen Aaron spites-it, And Miriam (his Sister) too back-bites-it. But suddainly, on her in his Defence, Foul Leprosie did punish this Offence. Nadab and Abihu for offring of strange Fire, are kild by Fire from Heaven.His Nephews, scorning his Command, aspire Before the Lord to offer forrain Fire: But on them soon a heav'nly Flame down-falling (As in the Sommer som hot-dry Exhaling, Or Blazing-Star with suddain flash doth fall At Palmers feet, and him affright with-all:) Fires instantly their beards and oyled hair, And all the sacred vestiments they wear; Exhales their blood, their Bodies burns to ashes, Their Censers melts with heat of Lightning flashes, Their coals are quenched all, and sacred Flame Th'vnhallow'd Fire devour'd and over-came. Core, Dathan and Abiram, their conspiracy.His Kins-man Core then (with Dathan ioyn'd, And with Abiram) murmur'd and repin'd: O see, saith he, how many a subtil gin The Tyrant sets to snare our Freedomins! How we, abus'd with Oracles most vain, (Which Moses and his brother Aaron fain) For idle hopes of promis'd Signories, Do simply lose our sweetest Liberties! See, how they do ingross between them two, Into one House, Scepter and Ephod too: See, how they dally, and with much delay Prolong their Iorney to prolong their Sway: And (to conclude) see how sly Course they take, To build their Greatness on our grievous wrack. Hear'st thou me (Moses) if thou chiefly ioy To see thy Brethren's torments and annoy, 'Twer good to walk vs yet for ten years more About these Mountains in these Desarts poor: Keep vs still Exiles; Let vs (our Desire) Languish, wax-olde, and in these Sands expire, Where cruell Serpents haunt vs still at hand, A Fruit-less, Flood-less, yea a Land-less Land. If, rear'd from Youth in Honour, thine Ambition Cannot com down to priuat mens condition, Be Captain, Duke and King: for, God approves-thee, Thy Vertues guard, the Peop'e fears and loves-thee. But as for Aaron, What is his desert? What High exploit, what Excellence, what Art Gain'd him th'High-Priesthood? O good God, what shame? Alas! hath he for any thing got fame But Horebs Horn-God? for despising thee, And thy Commands; and for Conspiracie? The morrow next, before the Sacred Tent This Mutiner with sacred Censer went Adorn'd, selfe-gazing, with a lofty ey, His faction present; Aaron also by. Lord shield thy Cause, approve thee veritable, Let not thy Name be to the Lewd a Fable: Oint thine Anointed publikely: by Miracle, Showe whom thou hast selected for thine Oracle, Said Moses then; and even as yet he spake, The groaning Earth began to reel and shake, A horrid Thunder in her bowels rumbles, And in her bosom vp and down it tumbles, Their dreadfull punishment. Tearing her Rocks, Vntill she Yawn a way To let it out, and to let-in the Day: Heav'n sees to Hell, and Hell beholdeth Heav'n, And Divels dazled with the glistring leav'n Of th'ancient Sun, yet lower fain would diue; But chain'd to th'Centre all in vain they striue. Core, round compast with his Rebel friends, Offers to Belzebvb and to the Fiends: His bodie's batter'd with Rocks falling down, And arms of Trees there planted vp-side-down: He goes with Noyse down to the Silent Coast, Intoombd alive, without all Art or cost. And all the rest that his proud side assum'd, Scaping the Gulf, with Lightning are consum'd. Aarons charge is confirmed by miracle.And Aaron's Office is confirm'd by God, With wondrous Signes of his oft-quickned Rod, Which dead, re-buds, re-blooms, and Almonds bears; When all his Fellows have no life in theirs. Sundry victories of the Israelites, vnder the conduct and direction of Moses.Now, shall I sing, through Moses prudent Sway, How Israel doth Amalec dismay, Arad and Og (that of huge Giants springs) Proud Hesebon, and the fiue Madian Kings, With the false Prelat, who profanely made Of Prophets-gifts a sacrilegious trade; Who false, sayes true; who striving (past all shame) To force the Spirit, is forced by the same: Who, snaring th'Hebrews with frail Beauties graces, Defiles their bodies, more their soules defaces? Doubt-less his Deeds are such, as would I sing But halfe of them, I vnder-take a thing As hard almost, as in the Gangic Seas To count the Waues, or Sands in Euphrates; And, of so much, should I a little say, It were to wrong him, and his Praise betray. Reseruing the Wars for another Discourse, our Poet hasteth to the death of Moses.His Noble Acts we therefore heer suspend, And skip vnto his sweet and happy End: Sith, th'End is it whereby we iudge the best (For either Life) how Man is Curst or Blest. Feeling his vigour by degrees to waste, And, one Fire quencht, another kindling fast, Which doth his Spirit re-found, his Soule refine, And raise to Heav'n, whence it was sent divine; By his example Men are warned not to defer to make their Will til it be too late to be troubled with the business of this World.He doth not (Now) study to make his Will, T'Entail his Land to his Male-Issue still: Wisely and iustly to divide his Good, To Sons and Daughters, and his neerest Blood: T'assigne his Wife a Dowry fair and fit, A hundred times to adde, and alter it: To quittance Friendships, with frank Legacies: To guerdon Service with Annuities, To make Executors, to Cancel som, T'appoint himselfe a Palace for a Tomb. I praise a care to settle our estate: But, when Death threats vs, then it is too-late. A seemly Buriall is a sacred Rite: But let the living take that charge of right. He (lifting higher his last thoughts) besides The Common-Weale's care, for the Church prouides, And grauing his discourse with voyce devout, Bids thus Farwell to all that stand about: O Iacob's seed (I might say, my deer sons) He pronounceth the blessing and the curses written in Leuit. 26. &amp; Deutero. 28. where vnto the people say Amen. Y'are sense-less more then metalls stocks or stones, If y'haue forgot the many-many Miracles Wher-with the Lord hath seal'd my sacred Oracles; And all the Favours (in this sauage Place) In forty yeers receiued of his grace. Therefore (O Israel) walk thou in his fear, And in thy hearts-hart (not in Marble) beare His ever-lasting Lavv: before him stand, And to his Service consecrate thy hand. If this thou do, thy Heav'n-blest fleecie Flocks Blessings on those that obey. Shall bound about thy Pastures, Downs and Rocks, As thick as skip in Sommer, in a Mead, The Grass-hoppers, that all with Deaw are fed: Thy fruitfull Eaws, fat Twins shall bring thee euer And of their Milk shall make a plentious Riuer: Th'olde Tyrant loads not with so-many loans, Toules, Taxes, Succours, Impositions, The panting Vassalls to him Tributary, As thy rich Fields shall pay thee voluntary: Thy children and thy children's children, set About thy Table side by side at meat, Shall flourish like a long and goodly rowe Of pale-green Olives that vprightly growe About a ground, and (full of Fruit) presage Plenty of Oyl vnto their Master sage: Sons of thy sons shall serue thy reuerend Eld: Thou shalt die quiet, thou shalt liue vnqueld: Blessed at home, and blessed in the Plain: The blessed God shall send thee timely Rain, And holsom windes, and with his keyes of grace Open Heav'ns store-house to thy happy Race: Thy proud fell Foes with Troops of armed men Shall charge thee one way, but shall flie thee ten; The Peace-Plant Olive, or Triumphant Bay Shall shade thy gates: Thy valour shall dismay And daunt the Earth: and with his sacred aw Thy Sauiour-King shall giue the World the Law. If other-wise; the Megrim, Gowt, and Stone, Curses on the Disobedient. Shall plague thee fell with thousand pangs in one Thy numbry Flocks in part shall barren be, In part shall bring abortives vnto thee: Accurst at home, accursed in the Plain, Thy labour boot-less, and thy care in vain: Thy Field shall be of steel, thy Heav'n of brass, Thy Fountains dry: and God displeas'd (alas!) In steed of holsom showrs, shall send down flashes Of Lightning, Fire, Hail, Sulphur, Salt, and ashes: Thou shalt reap little where thou much hast shed, And with that little shall thy Foe be fed; He shall the fattest of thy Heard devour Before thy face, and yet thou must not lowr: Thou shalt build fair, another haue thy Place: Thou wed a wife, another 'fore thy face Shall lose her Bride-belt: God with rage shall smite Thy stubborn heart, with blindness and affright; So that a wagging leaf, a puff, a crack, Yea, the least creak shall make thee turn thy back: Thou never shalt thine adverse Hoast survay, But to be beaten, or to run away. A People stout, for strength and number ample, Which th'Eagle hath for Ensigne and Example, With a new Wall thine ancient Wall shall dam, And make thee (Famisht) thy voyd bowels cram With thine owne bowels, and for want of meat Thine owne deer Children's trembling flesh to eat. And then, thy Remnant (far disperst from home) O'r all the Corners of the Earth shall roam: To shew their Curse, they shall no Countrey ow'ne, And (which is worse) they shall not be their Owne. AMEN, said all the Hoast. Then (like the Swan) This dying Song, the Man of GOD began: The Song Of Moses. Sith Israel (O wil-full!) will not hear; Hearken O Heavens, and O thou Earth giue ear Vnto my voyce, and Witness (on my part) Before the Lord, my zeal and their hard hart. O Heav'n and Earth attend vnto my Song, Hear my discourse, which sweetly slides along; As silver showrs on the dry Meads do trill, And hony deaws, on tender grass distill. God grant (I pray) that in their hearts my Verse (As water on the withered Lawns) may pearce: And that the hony dropping from my tongue May serue the olde for rain, for deaw the young. I sing th'Eternall: O let Heav'n and Earth Com praise him with me, sound his glory forth, Extoll his powr, his perfect Works record, Truth, Goodnes, Greatnes, Iustice of the Lord. But, though for ever He haue showen him such; His children yet (no Children, rather much A Bastard Race) full of malicious sin, All kinde of vice haue foully wallowed in. O foolish People! doost thou thus requite His Father-care, who fenç't thee day and night, As with a Shield? Who chose thee as his heir? Who made thee, of so foul a mass, so fair? Vn-winde the bottom of olde Times again, Of Ages past vn-reel the snarled skain: Ask of thy Parents and they shall declare; Thine Elders, and they'l tell thee Wonders rare. They'l tell thee, how, when first the Lord had spred Men on the Earth, and iustly levelled His strait long Measure, th'All-Ball to divide, He did for thee a plentious Land provide: For his deer Iacob, whom his fauour then Seem'd t'haue sequestred from the rest of men, To th'end his Blessed Seed (in future age) Should be his care, Loue, Lot and Heritage. They'l tell thee too, how through the sandy horror Of a vast Desart, Den of ghastly Terror, Of Thirst and Hunger, and of Serpents fell, He by the hand conducted Israel: Yea (of his goodnes) to direct him still, By Word and Writ show'd him his sacred Will; Vnder his wings shade hid him tenderly, And held him deer, as apple of his ey. As is the royall Eagle's sacred wont, When she would teach her tender Birds to mount, To flie and cry about her Nest, to cheer-them; And when they faint, on her wingd back to bear-them: God (without aid of other Gods or Graces) Safe guide, hath made him mount the highest Places, Such Oyl and Hony from the Rocks distilling, In plentious Land with pleasant Fruits him filling. He gaue him Milk and Butter for his meat, Kid, Lamb, and Mutton, with the flowr of Wheat; And for his Drink, a most delicious Wine (The sprightfull blood of the broad-spreading Vine). But, waxen fat, he lifts his wanton heel Against his God (to whom his soule should kneel: Forsakes his Maker, and contemns the Same That saved him from danger, death, and shame. Then, he inflam'd the fury of the Lord, With profane bowing to false Gods abhord: With serving Idols, and with Sacrificing To Fiends, and Phansies of his own devising. For vain false gods, gods vn-renown'd, and new, Gods that his Fathers nor he never knew, He hath forgot the true eternall Beeing, The God of whom he holdes his bliss and being. God saw it well, and Iealously a-fire, Against his Children thus he threats his ire: No; I will hide the brightness of my face, I'll take from them the treasures of my grace, Then let vs see what will of them becom: But, what but mischiefe can vnto them com, That so perverse with every puff let fly Their Faith, sole constant in inconstancy? Th'have made me ieloux of a god, no god: I'll make them ieloux, I will Wed (abroad) A People (yet) no People: And their brest Shall split, for spight, to see the Nations blest. Devouring Fire, that from my heart doth fume, Shall fiercely burn and in my wrath consume The deep of Deeps, the middle Downs, and Fields, And strong foundations of the steepest Hils. I'll spend on them my store of punishments, And all mine Arrows; Famine, Pestilence, Wilde Beasts, and Worms that basely crawling are, Without remorse shall make them end-less War. Abroad, the Sword their strong men shall devour, At home, through Fear, the Virgin in her flowr, The fresh young Youth, the sucking Children small, And hoary head, dead to the ground shall fall. Yea, even already would I quite deface And clean destroy them, I would Iacob race, Raze his memoriall from the Earth for ay, But that I fear the Heathen thus would say: We haue prevail'd, we by our strength alone Have quell'd this People, and them over-throwen: 'Twas not their God that did it for their Sins; No, He himselfe is vanquisht with his Friends. Ha! sottish blocks, void of all sense and sight: Could one man put a thousand men to flight; And two, ten thousand, if the God of Arms Had not even sould their Troops and bourd their arms? For God, our God, doth all their gods surpass: They knowe it well: but, their Wine springs (alas!) From Sodom's Vine, and grew in Gomor's fields, Which Gall for Grapes, for Raysins Poyson yeelds. It is no Wine: no, the black bane it is, The killing vomit of the Cockatrice; 'Tis bitter venom, 'tis the same that coms From the fell Aspik's foul infecting gums. Do not I know it? keep not I account (In mine Exchequer) how their sins do mount? Vengeance is mine: I will (in fine) repay In my due time: I will not long delay. Their Ruin posteth: then, th'Omnipotent Shall Iudge for Iacob: then will I repent To quite destroy mine owne beloved People, Seeing their strength all fail'd and wholly feeble. 'Twill then be said, Where are their gods becom (Their deaf, dull Idols, sent-less, sight-less, dumb) To whom they lift their hearts, and hands, and eyes, And (as their Guards) so oft did sacrifice? Now let those trim Protectors them protect; Let them rise quickly and defend their Sect, Their Fires and Altars; and com stand before, To shield the Fondlings that their Fanes adore. Know therefore, Mortals, I th'Immortal am: There's none like Me, in or aboue this Frame: I wound, I heal; I kill, I fetch from Graue, And from my hands none can the Sinner saue. I'll lift my hand toward th'arched Heav'ns on high, And swear with-all by mine Eternity (Which only Beeing, giues to all to Been) That if I whet my Sword of Vengeance keen: I force (I say) as soverain King alone, I sit me down on my high iustice Throne, I'll venge me roughly on mine Enemies, And guerdon iustly their iniquities: My heart-thrill Darts I will make drunk with blood, I'll glut my sword with slaughter; all the brood Of rebell Nations I will face (in fine) To recompense the blood and death of Mine. O Gentiles, then his People praise and fear, Sith to the Lord it is so choisely deer: Sith hee'l avenge his Cause; and, beating down His enemies, will mildly cheer his Own. FINIS. The Captaines. THE IIII. PART OF OF THE THIRD DAY OF THE II. WEEK. The Argvment. Iust Duked Iosvah cheers the Abramides To Canaan's Conquest: Iordan self-divides: Re-Circumcision, what, and where, and why: Sackt Iericho: Hai won (so Achan die): Gabaonites guile: strange Hail: the Sun stands still: Nature repines. Iews (Guide-less) prone to ill. Adoni-Bezec. Sangar, Debora, Barac and Iahel conquer Sisara. Samuel succeeds: Iews craue a King: a vie Of People-Sway; States-Rule: and Monarchy. Hail holy Iordan, and you blessed Torrents Of the pure Waters, of whose crystall Currents Canaan saluted. So many Saints haue sipt: O Walls, that rest Fair Monuments of many a famous Guest: O Hills, O Dales, O Fields so flowry sweet, Where Angels oft haue set their sacred feet: And thou O sacred Place, which wert the Cradle Of th'only Man-God, and his happy Swadle: And thou O Soil, (which drank'st the crimsin Showr That (for our health) out of his veins did pour: And you fat Hillocks (which I take as given For a firme pledge of the full ioyes of Heav'n) Where milk and Hony flowe; I see you all, Vnder the conduct of my Generall, Nvn's valiant Son: and vnder Gedeon's Sway, Sangar, and Samson, Barac, Debora. Argument of this Tract.For, heer (braue Heroes) your high Feats I sing; Thrice sacred Spirit, thy speedie succour bring: O Spirit, which wert their Guide, Guard, strength and stay, Let not my Verse their Vertue's praise betray. Iosvah, by Favour nor by Bribes, obtains Iosua his iust authority, over the People of Israell.A higher Rank then Royall Soverains (Who buies in gross, he by retail must sell: And who gives Favour, Favour asks as well): He gets it not by Fortune (she is sight-less): Neither by Force (for, whoso enters (Right-less) By Force, is forced to go out with shame): Nor sodain climbs he (raw) vnto the same (For, to high Place, who mounts not step by step, He coms not down, but head-long down doth leap): Simile. But, even as that grave-gracefull Magistrate, Which (now) with Conscience, Law doth Moderate, Was first a Student (vnder others aw) Then Barister, then Counseller at-Law, Then Queens Solicitor, then Roules-Arbitrer, And then Lord-keeper, now Lord Chanceler; He coms to 't by degrees: and hauing first Show'n Himselfe wise in spying Canaan yerst, Faith-full to Moses in his Ministrings, And Stout in Fight against the Heathen Kings, God makes him Captain, and the sacred Priests Pronounce him so, the People pleased is. His first Oration to the People.But in his State yer he be stall'd (almost) Set in the midst of God's beloved Hoast, He thus dilates: O happy Legions deer, Which sacred Arms vnder Heav'ns Ensignes beare, Fear not that I, yet forty years, again Your wandring Troops in these vast sands should train 'Twixt Hope and Fear: th'vn-hallowed Offerings, The proud revolts, blasphemous Murmurings Of your stiff Fathers, have with-holden rather Then whole with-draw'n th'aid of your heauenly Father: God tenders it in time, and (pacifi'd) Nills the set Term without effect should slide. Serve him therfore, now take him at his word, And now to Canaan march with one accord, And bravely shewe that th'Hoast of Israel, In Valour, far doth his drad Fame excell. Courageous Iacob, Arad's stoutest hearts And strongest Holdes have prov'd thy Pikes and Darts, The Madianites have thine Arms thunder knowen, Th'hast razed Bazan, ransackt Hezebon, Scap't scaly Serpents (in these Desarts vast) Crost the Red-Sea; and Heav'n-prop Sina past, And sent to Hell thy draddest Foes: Lo, now God offers thee the Crown, accept it thou. Then turning him to Rvben and to Gad, He vrgeth particularly Ruben, Gad, and Manasses to take part with their Brethren, in prosecuting the Conquest of Canaan. And to Manasses, who their Portion had By Moses grant on Iordan's Eastern verge; War-eloquent, he thus proceeds to vrge: Can you (my Harts) finde in your hearts to leaue Your Ranks, and vs thus of your aids bereaue? Will you lie wrapped in soft beds a-sleep, While in colde Trenches your poor Brethren keep? Will you sit washing (when your Feasts be don) In sweet Rose-water, while that Orion His cloudy store in storm-full fury pours, And drowns your Brethren with continuall showrs? Will you go dance and dally to and fro, While in the Field they march to charge the Foe? Will you expect a part with them in gain, While they the blowes and all the brunt sustain? God shield, you should dishonour so your Blood: Nay rather (leaving on this side the Flood Your Wiues and Children, and (vnfit for Battell) Your aged Parents, and your Heards of Cattell) Com arm your selues, t'advance our Victories, And share with vs in Perill, as in Prize. O noble Prince (then all the Hoast reply'd) The general and ioyfull answer of the people. March-on a Gods name; and good Hap betide: Were Canaan turn'd another Wilderness, Were there before vs yet more crimsin Seas, Were Horeb, Carmel, and Mount Seir set Each vpon other (vp to Heav'n to get) We'l follow thee through all; and only th'end Of our owne liues shall our brave Iourney end. After the Ark, then march they in aray Direct to Iordan, praising all the way That living God, whose match-less mighty hand Parted the Sea, that they might pass by Land. Hoar-headed Iordan neatly lodged was A poeticall and pleasant description of the Riuer Iordan. In a large Caue, built all of beaten Glass; Whose waved Seeling, with exceeding cost, The Nymphs (his Daughters) rarely had imbost With Pearls and Rubies, and in-lay'd the rest With Nacre checks, and Corall of the best: A thousand Streamlings that n'er saw the Sun, With tribute silver to his service run: There, Iris, Avster, and Clowds blewly black Continually their liquor leaue and take: There, th'aged Flood lay'd on his mossie bed, And pensiue leaning his flag-shaggie head Vpon a Tuft, where th'eating waues incroach, Did gladly wait for Israels approach: Each haire he hath is a quick-flowing stream, His sweat the gushing of a storm extream, Each sigh a Billow, and each sob he sounds A swelling Sea that over-flowes his bounds: His weak gray eyes are alwaies seen to weep, About his loyns a rush-Belt wears he deep, A Willow Wreath about his wrinkled brows; His Father Nerevs his complexion showes. So soon as He their welcom rumour heard His frosty head aboue the Waues he rear'd, With both his hands strook back behinde his ears The waving Tresses of his weeping hairs: And then perceiving Iacob's Army stay'd By his prowd streams, he chid them thus, and said: Prosopopœia.Presumptuous Brook, dar'st thou (ingratefull Torrent) Lift-vp thy horn, lash-out thy swelling Current Against the Lord, and over-flowe thy bound To stop his passage? Shall the Floods profound Of the prowd Ocean to his Hoast give-way? Shall Egypt's honour, shall that Gulf (I say) That long large Sea, which with his plentious waves A third or fourth part of the World be-laves; Shall That yeeld humbly at his Servant's beck? And thou, poor Rill, or gutter (in respect) Resist himselfe (his glorious selfe) that Inns Heer in his Ark, between the Cherubins? And saying so, he on his shoulder flung His deep wide Crock, that on his hip had hung, And down his back pours back-ward all his course. The stream returns towards his double source; And, leaving dry a large deep lane betwixt, The fearfull waves in heaped Hils were fixt, To give God place, and passage to his hoast, Towards their Promis'd and appointed coast. The Israelites passe dry-shod through Iordan.So, dry they pass (after the sacred Oracle) And leaue Memorials of that famous Miracle Vpon Mount Gilgal: and their flesh anon They seal with Signe of their Adoption. For, the All-guiding God, th'Almighty Prince, To giue to His som speciall difference, Circumcision.Will'd that all Males of Abram's Progenies With sacred Rasor should them Circumcise; And ever-more, that Isaac's blessed Race Should in their Fore-skin bear his gage of Grace. A curious Question, why it was appointed in such a place.But, why (sayst thou) should ancient Israel, In such a secret place Record and Seal Th'Act of the Covenant: and with bloody smart Ingrave their glory in a shamefull part? Who blushes at it, is a grace-less Beast: A sharp and sober answer. Who shames to see the Signe of Grace imprest In shamefull part, he is asham'd of Christ. Born of that Race, and selfly Circumcis'd. A hundred subtill Reasons from the Writs Of Rabbins could I bring: but, sober Wits Rest satisfied, conceiving that th'incision Of th'obscœne Fore-skin, signifies th'abscission, The right application and vse thereof. Or sacred cutting-off of foul Affects, Beseeming those whom God for His elects: That God the Fruits of Flesh and Blood doth hate: And that through Christ we must regenerate. Now, th'Hebrews kept their Pass-over; and go The Passeover. (By Heav'ns address) to mighty Iericho, Besieging so the City round about, That fear got in, but nothing could get out. Souldiers (said then th'vndaunted Generall) The siege of Iericho after a strange manner. Prepare no Mattocks, Ladders, nor Rams at all, To mine, or scale, or batter-down these Tows: The great, the high, the mighty God of Powrs Will fight himself alone: and then he bod (As first himself had been inform'd by God) That daily once they all should march the Round About the City with horn-Trumpets sound; Bearing about, for only Banneret, The light-full Ark, GOD's sacred Cabinet: The Citizens deride it. Their swords vn-drawn, not making any noise, Threat-less their brows, and without braves their voice, No shaft to shoot, no signe of War, no glance, And even their March doth rather seem a Dance. What Childre-spell? what May-game have we heer? What? dare you (Gallants) dare you com no neer? Is this your brave Assault? is this your Fight? Ween you with Scar-crowes vs (like birds) to fright? (Said the besieged) get you som where else (Poor sots) to shewe your Bug-bears and your spels: Cease your hoarse musick, leave the stage alone: Fools, draw the Curten, now your Play is done. Six dayes together had the Hebrews thus't On the 7 day, their wals of themselves fall down. About the Town, seaven-times the Seventh they must; When sacred Levits sound more lowd and high Their horny Trumps: then all the people cry, Com, com (great God) com, batter, batter down These odious walls, this Idol wedded Town. It cracks in th'instant, the foundation shrinks, The mortar crumbles from the yawning chinks, Each stone is loose, and all the wall doth quiver, And all at once vnto the ground doth shiuer With hideous noyse; and th'Heathen Guarison Is but immur'd with Clowds of dust alone: Simile.So shall you see a Clowd-crown'd Hill somtime, Torn from a greater by the waste of Time, Dreadly to shake, and boundling down to hop; And roaring, heer it roules tall Cedars vp, There aged Oaks; it turns, it spurns, it hales The lower Rocks into th'affrighted Vales, There sadly sinks, or suddain stops the way Of som swift Torrent hasting to the Sea. Boast you, O Bombards, that you Thunder drown: And vaunt you, Mines, that you turn vp side-down Rampires and Towrs, and Walls the massie-most: Yet, your exploits require both time and cost; You make but a small breach, but a rough way, And (by mischance) oft your own side betray, But, th'Hebrews with a suddain showt and cry, A whole great Town dis-mantle instantly, And (vnresisted) entring every-where, They exercise all hostile vengeance there. Simile.And, as a sort of lusty Bil-men, set In Wood-sale time to fell a Cops, by great; Be-stir them so, that soon with sweating pain, They turn an Oak-groue to a field of grain: Iericho sackt and consumed with fire, and all her inhabitants put to the sword without respect of State, Sexe or Age.So th'Hebrew Hoast, without remorse or pitty, Through all sad corners of the open City, Burn, break, destroy, bathe them in blood, and toyl To lay all leuell with the trampled soyl: The Idol's Temples, and the delicat Prince-Palaces are quickly beaten flat: The Fire lowd-crackling with the Clowds doth meet, A bloody Torrent runs through euery street, Their venge-full sword spares neither great nor small; Neither the Childe that on his hands doth crawl, Nor him that wears snowe on his shaking head, Ice in his heart; not the least Peast they bred. A deed (indeed) more worthy th'Heseline, Than th'holy Hebrews; had the voice Divine Not charg'd them so, and choicely armed them 'Gainst Iericho, with his owne Curse. Anathem; Reseruing only for his Sacred Place, The Gold and Siluer, th'Iron and the Brass. Acham's Sacriledge.Yet sacrilegious Achan dar'd to hoord Som precious Pillage: which incenst the Lord Against the Camp, so that he let, them fly (For this Offence) before their Enemy. For, when three thousand chosen Israelites Were sent to Hai t'assault the Cananites, Hai summoned the Townes men sally &amp; put the Israelites to flight. The Town all armes: their Prince the forwardest (No less-brave Souldier then proud Athëist) Arms the broad Mountain of his hairy breast; With horrid scales of Nilus greedy beast; His brawny arms and shoulders, with the skin Of the dart-darting wily Porcupin: He wears for Helm a Dragon ghastly head, Wher-on for Plume a huge Horse-tail doth spread; Not much vnlike a Birch-tree bare belowe, The antik armour of the King. His insolent and blasphemous Oration. Which at the top in a thick tuft doth growe, Waving with euery winde, and made to kiss Th'Earth, now on that side, and anon on this: In Quyver made of Lezard's skins he wears His poysoned Arrows; and the Bowe he bears, Is of a mighty Tree, strung with a Cable, His Shaft a Lever, whose keen head is able To pearce all proof, stone, steel, and Diamant. Thus furnished, the Tyrant thus doth vaunt: Sirs, shall we suffer this ignoble Race, Thus shamefully vs from our Owne to chase? Shall they be Victors yet they overcom? Shall our Possessions and our Plenty com Among these Mongrels? Tush: let Children quake At dreams of Abram: let faint Women shake At their drad God, at their Sea-drying Lord; I know no Gods aboue my glittering Sword. This sayd, he sallies and assaults the Foe With furious skirmish; and doth charge them so, As stormy billows rush against a Rock: 3. Simile. As boystrous windes (that haue their prison broak) Roar on a Forrest: as Heav'ns sulph'ry Flash Against proud Mountains surly brows doth dash. The sacred Troops (to conquer alwayes wont) Could not sustain his first tempestuous brunt, But turn their backs: and, as they fly amain, Foure less than fourty of their band were slain. Iosuah and the Prince of Israel humbled before the Lord in Prayer. The son of Nvn then (with th'Isacian Peers) Before the Ark in prostrate wise appeares. Sack on his back, dust on his head, his eyes Even great with teares, thus to the Lord he cries: O! what alas? what haue we don, O Lord? The People, destin'd to thy Peoples sword, Conquers thy people; and the Cananites (Against thy Promise) chase the Israelites. O Lord, why did not Iordans rapid Tyde Still stay our Hoast vpon the other side? Sith heer, in hope to get the Promis'd more, We hazzard all that we had won before. Regard and guard vs; nay, regard thy Name: O! suffer not the seed of Abraham (Almighty Father, O thou God most high!) To be expos'd to Heathen's Tyranny! Much less thy sacred Ark, for them to burn: And least of all, thy glorious Self, to scorn. Iosvah (sayd God) let th'Hoast be sanctifi'd, And let the Church-thief die, that dar'd to hide Th'vn-lawfull Pillage of that cursed Town (The Mayden Conquest, prime of thy Renown): Then shalt thou vanquish, and the lofty Towrs Of Hai shal fall vnder thy war-like powrs. The morrow next, after the great Assise, Achan executed. Achan (conuicted, not by bare surmize, But by God's Spirit, which vndermines our mindes, And cleerly sees our secretest designes; To whom, Chance is no Chance, and Lot no Lot, To whom the Die vncertain rouleth not) Is brought without the Hoast, with all hee hath, And sacrifiç'd vnto th'Almighties wrath. Now, between Bethel and Hai's western wall, There lies a valley close inuiron'd all Between the forking of a Hill so high, That it is hidden from all passers-by: Whose horned clifts, below are hollowed, And with two Forrests arbour'd ouer-head: 'Tis long and narrow; and a rapid Torrent, Bounding from Rock to Rock with roaring Current, Deaffens the Shepheards: so that it should seem Nature fore-cast it for som stratagem. An ambush.Thither the Duke (soon after mid-night) guides His choycest Bands, and them there war'ly hides: Ech keeps his place, none speaks, none spets, none coughs; But all as still, as if they march on moss: Simile.So fallow Wolues, when they intend to set On fearfull flocks that in their Folds do bleat, Through silent dardness secret ways do groap; Their feet are feathered with the wings of hope, They hold their breath, and so still vn-discri'd, They pass hard by the watchfull Mastie's side. Mean-while the howrs opened the doors of Day, To let out Titan that must needs away: Whose radiant tresses, but with trailing on, Began to gild the top of Libanon; When, with the rest of all his Hoast, the Signifieth but an Earle: but here it is vsurped for the chiefe Captain Iosuah. Grave Marcheth amain to giue the Town a braue, They straight re-charge him: as in season warm The hony-makers busie-buzzing swarm, With humming threats throngs from the little gates Simile. Of their round Towr, and with their little hates Fiercely assayl, and wound the naked skins Of such as come to rob their curious Inns. Why (Cowards) dare you com again for blowes? Or, do you long your wretched liues to lose? Com, we are for you; wee'l dispatch you soon: And for the many wrongs that you haue don Vnto ourselues, our Neighbours, and our Friends, This day our swords shall make vs full amends (Cry th'Amorites): and th'Hebrew Captain then A stratagem. Flies, as affraid, and with him all his men Disorderly retire; still faining so, Till (politik) he hath in-trayn'd the Foe Right to his Ambush: then the Souldiers there, Hid in the Vale hearing their noise so neer, Would fain be at them, were they not with-held By threatning gestures of Commanding Eld: So haue I seen on Lamborn's pleasant Douns, Simile. When yelping Begles or som deeper Hounds Haue start a Hare, how milk-white Minks and Lun (Gray-bitches both, the best that euer run) Held in one leash, haue leapt and strain'd, and whin'd To be restrain'd, till (to their masters minde) They might be slipt, to purpose; that (for sport) Watt might haue law, neither too-long nor short. But, when the Heathen had the ambush past, The Duke thus cheers his sacred Troops as fast, Sa, sa, my Hearts; turn, turn again vpon-them, They are your own; now charge, and cheerly on-them. His ready Souldiers at a beck obay, And on their Foes courageous load they lay: They shoot, they shock, they strike, they stab, they kill Hai, conquered. Th'vnhallowed Currs, that yet resisted still; Vntill behind them a new storm arose With horrid noise, which daunts not only those, But with the fury of it's force doth make The Hills and Forrests, and euen Hell to quake. Pagans, what will you do? If heer you fly, You fall on Caleb, where y'are sure to dy: If there, on Iosuah: O vnfortunate! Your help-less gods in vain you invocate. Y'are (O forlorn!) like Rabbets round beset With wily Hunters, Dogs, and deadly Net: With shrill Sa-haw, heer-heer-ho, heer-again, Simile. The Warren rings; th'amazed Game amain Runs heer and there: but, if they scape away From Hounds, staues kill them; if from staues, the Hay. Yeeld, yeeld, and dy then, strive not to retire: For, even in death behould your Town a-fire. Then Gabaon, a mighty City neer, That these Exploits of Heav'ns drad hand did hear, Sent subtilly, to League with Israel. No: y'are deceiv'd (said then th'Arch-Colonel) The Cananites are destin'd long ago To Fire, and Sword, and vtter Over-throwe; From Heav'ns high Iudge the Sentence doth proceed: Man may not alter what God hath decreed. The Gibeonites' cunning policy, to make league with Israel.Alas! my Lord (reply'd th'Embassadors) You may perceive, we are no Borderers Vpon these Countries: For, our suits, our slops, Our hose and shoos, were new out of the shops When we set forth from home; and even that day This Bread was baked when we came away; But the long Iourney, we have gon, hath wore Our cloaths to rags, and turn'd our victuals hoar. W'adiure you therefore in the sacred Name Of that drad GOD to whom your vows you frame, By the sweet air of this delightfull Coast, By the good Angell that conducts your Hoast, By dear Embraces of your dearer Wives, And by your Babes (even) dearer then your lives; By each of these, and all of these together, And by your Arms, whose Fame hath drawn vs hither, T'have pity on vs, and to swear vnto-vs, To save our lives, and not so to vndo-vs, As these neer Nations. Israel accords, And with an Oath confirms the solemn words. A sacred application of their profane example.So, I (good Lord) perceiving all the Seed Of Sin-full Adam vnto Death decreed, Doom'd to the Vengeance of thy Fury fell, And damn'd for ever to the deepest Hell; Would fain be free: but, if I should (alas!) Com, as I am, before thy glorious face, Thou (righteous God) wilt turn thine eyes away; For, Flesh and Blood possess not Heav'n, for ay; And, the strict Rigour of thy Iustice pure Cannot (O Lord) the least of sins endure. Oh then! what shall I doo? I'll similize These Gabaonites: I will my self disguize To gull thee, Lord (for, even a holy Guile Findes with thee grace and fauour often-while): I'll put-on (crafty) not the cloak of Pride (For, that was it wherby our Grand-sires di'd; And Lucifer, with his associates, fell From Ioys of Heav'n, into the Pains of Hell); But th'humble Fleece of that sweet sacred Lamb Which (for our sakes) vpon the Cross becam So torn and tatter'd; which the most refuse: Scorn of the Gentiles, Scandal of the Iewes. And, as a piece of Silver, Tin, or Lead, Simile. By cunning hands with Gold is covered; I, that am all but Lead (or dross, more base) In fervent Crusible of thy free Grace, I'll gild me all with his pure Beautie's Gould; Born a new man (by Faith) I'll kill mine ould: In Spirit and Life, Christ shall be mine example, His Spirit shall be my spirit, and I his Temple. I beeing thus in Christ, and Christ in me, O! wilt thou, canst thou, drive Vs far from thee? Deprive, from promis'd new-Ierusalem, Christ thine owne Likenes; and me, like to him? Banish from Heav'n (whose Bliss shall never vade) Thy Christ, by whom; and me, for whom 't was made? But, O Presumption! O too rash Designe! Alas! to Will it onely, is not mine: And, though I Would, my flesh (too-Winter-chill) My spirit's small sparkles doth extinguish still. O! therefore thou, thou that canst all alone; All-sacred Father's like all-sacred Son, Through thy deep Mercy daign thou to transform Into thy Self, me sin-full silly worm; That so, I may be welcom to my God, And live in Peace, not where the Iewes abode, But in Heav'n-Sion: and that thou maist be Th'vniting glew between my God and me. Now, Eglon's, Hebron's, Iarmuth's, Salem's Lords, And Lachis Kingling (after these Accords) Wroth, that their Neighbours had betrayed so Their common Country to their common Foe, Had made so great a breach, and by the hand Led (as it were) th'Hebrews into their Land; Set-vpon Gabaon: but th'Isaacian Prince, As iust as valiant, hastes to hunt them thence; And, resolute to rescue his Allies, He straight bids Battell to their enemies. The Fight growes fierce; and winged Victory, The Battell of the five Kings. Shaking her Laurels, rusht confusedly Into the midst; she goes, and coms, and goes, And now she leans to these, and now to those. Auster the while from neighbour Mountains arms A hundred Winters, and a hundred storms With huge great Hail-shot, driving fiercely-fell In the stearn visage of the Infidel: Extraordinary Volleys of Hail-shot fr? Heauen vpon the Infidels.The roaring Tempest violently retorts Vpon themselues the Pagans whirling darts, And in their owne breasts, their owne Launces bore, Wher-with they threatned th'Hoast of God before: And (euen) as if it enuied the Renown Of valiant Iosuah (now by Ganges knowen) With furious shock, the formost Ranks it whirr'd Vpon the next, the second on the third: Simile.Even as a Bridge of Cards, which Play-full Childe Doth in an euening on a Carpet build, When som Wag by, vpon his Work doth blowe; If one Arch fall, the rest fall all arowe Each vpon other, and the Childe he cries For his lost labour, and again he tries. If any, resting on his knotty Spear, 'Gainst Arms and storms, yet stand out stifly there, Th'Hail, which the Winde full in his face doth yerk, Smarter than Racquets in a Court re-ierk Balls 'gainst the Walls of the black-boorded house, Beats out his eyes, batters his nose, and brows. Then turn the Pagans, but without a vail: For, instantly the stony storm of Hail Which flew direct a-front, direct now falls Plumb on their heads, and cleaues their sculs and cauls: And euer, as they waver to and fro, Ouer their Hoast the Haily Clowd doth go: And neuer hits one Hebrue, though between, But a sword's length (or not so much) be seen: A buckler one, another a bright helm Over his threatned or sick head doth whelm; But, the shield broken, and helm beaten in, Th'Hail makes the hurt bite on the bloody green. Those, that escape, betake them to their heels; Iosuah pursues: and though his sweat distills From every part, he wounds, he kills, he cleaues. Neither the Fight imperfect so he leaues: But, full of faithfull zeal and zealous faith, Thus (O strange language!) thus alowd he saith; At the comm?d of Iosuah the Sun standeth still.Beam of th'Eternall, daies bright Champion, Spiall of Nature, O all-seeing Sun, Stay, stand thou still, stand still in Gabaon; And thou, O Moon i' th'vale of Aialon, That th'Ammorites now by their hare-like flight Scape not my hands vnder all-hiding Night. As a Caroche, draw'n by foure lusty steeds, In a smooth way whirling with all their speeds, Stops suddainly, if't slip into a slough, Or if it cross som Log or massie bough; The Day-reducing Chariot of the Sun, Which now began, towards his West to run, Stops instantly, and giues the Hebrewes space To rid the Pagans that they haue in chase. Nature, amaz'd, for very anger shakes: Description of Nature, who offended thereat, makes her complaint to God. And to th'Almighty her complaint she makes: Seemly she marches with a measur'd pase, Choler puts colour in her lovely face, From either nipple of her bosom-Twins A liuely spring of pleasant milke there spins, Vpon her shoulders (Atlas-like) she bears The frame of All, down by her side shee wears A golden Key, where-with shee letteth-forth, And locketh-vp the Treasures of the Earth: A sumptuous Mantle to her heels hangs down, Where-in the Heauens, the Earth, and Sea is showen; The Sea in Siluer woven, the Earth in Green, The Heav'ns in Azure, with gold threds between: All-quickning Loue, fresh Beauty, smiling Youth, And Fruitfulness, each for her fauour su'th: Grace still attends ready to do her honour, Riches and Plenty alwaies waite vpon her. Accoutred thus, and thus accompani'd, With thousand sighs thus to the Lord she cri'd: Prosopopœia. Shall it be sayd, a Man doth Heav'n command? Wilt thou permit a brauing Souldiers hand To wrong thine eldest Daughter? Ah! shall I Haue the bare Name, and He th'authority To govern all, and all controul (O Lord) With the bare winde of his ambitious word? Shall I (the World's Law) then, receiue the Law At others hands? of others stand in aw? If't be thy pleasure, or thou think it fit, To haue it so, or so to suffer it, (Pardon me, Father, that I am so free) I heer surrender thy Lieutenancy: Bestow't on him, put all into his hand: Who Heav'n commands, He well may Earth command. Why (daughter) know'st thou not (God answers her) That many times my Mercy doth transfer Into my Children mine owne power, wher-by They work (not seldom) mine owne Wonders high? That th'are my sacred Vice-Royes? and that Hee, Who (stript of Flesh) by Faith is ioyn'd to me, The power of a stedfast Faith. May remove Mountains, may dry-vp the Seas, May make an Ocean of a Wilderness? Th'hast seen it, Daughter: therfore, but thou pine In Ielousie of this drad arm of mine, Grudge not at theirs: for they can nothing do, But what my Spirit inables them vnto. IOSVAH his victories.O happy Prince; I wonder not at all, If at thy feet the stout Anachian fall, If th'Amorrhite, Hevite, and Cananite, The Pheresite, Hethite, and Iebusite, And huge Basanian, by thy daunt-less Hoast Were over-throwne: and if as swift (almost) As my slowe Muse thy sacred Conquest sings, Thou Cam'st, Saw'st, Conquer'dst more then thirty Kings; Subduing Syria, and dividing it Vnto twelue Kindreds in twelue portions fit; Sith (O grand Vicar of th'Almighty Lord) With onely summons of thy mighty Word, Thou makest Riuers the most deafly-deep To lobstarize (back to their source to creep); Walls giue thee way: after thy Trumpets charge, Rock-rushing Tempests do retreat, or charge: Sol's at thy seruice: and the starry Pole Is proud to pass vnder thy Muster-Roule. Simile.As a blind man, forsaken of his Guide In some thick Forest, sad and self-beside, Takes now a broad, anon a narrow path, His groaping hand his (late) eys office hath, Heer at a stub he stumbles, there the bushes Rake-off his Cloak, heer on a Tree he rushes, Strayes in and out, turns, this and that way tries, And at the last falls in a Pit, and dies: After his death Israel hauing lost his guide, fals from his God.Euen so (alas!) hauing their Captain lost, So blindely wanders Iacob's wilfull Hoast, Contemns the Fountain of God's sacred Law, From Idoll-Puddles poysoning drink to draw; Forsakes th'old true God, and new fals-gods fains, And with the Heathen friendship entertains. God therefore forsakes him.Th'Almighty saw it (for, what sees he not?) And sodainly his fury wexed hot; And on their neck, for his sweet yoak, he layd The Strangers yoak that hard and heauie waigh'd. Simile.But, as an Infant which the Nurce lets go To go alone, waves weakly to and fro, Feels his feet fail, cries out, and but (alas!) For her quick hand, would fall and break his face: So Iacob, iustly made afflictions thrall, Is neuer ready in the Pit to fall Of pale Despair, but (if he cry, and craue him) God still extends his gracious hand to saue him; Raising som Worthy that may break in sunder Vpon his Repentance God againe receives him to favour. The Gyves and Fetters that he labours vnder. So then, assisted by th'immortall hand, Brave Israel brings vnder his Command Iervsalem, Lvs, Bethel, Accaron, Sesai, and Tholmai, Gaza, and Ascalon, And Bezec too: whose bloudy Tyrant, fled, Is caught again, and payd with Cake for Bread: To self-taught Torture he himself is put, The Tyrant Adoni-Bezec taken &amp; intreated as he had handled others. His sacrilegious Thumbs and Toes be cut. Whereby, more inly prickt, then outly payn'd, God's Vengeance iust he thus confest, and playn'd; O hand, late Scepter-graç't! O hand, that late Egypt did dread, and Edom tremble at! His complaint. O hand, that (armed) durst euen Mars defie, And could'st haue pull'd proud Ivpiter from high! Now, where-to serv'st thou, but t'augment my moan? Thou canst not now buckle mine Armour on; Nor wield my mighty Lance with brazen head: Ah! no (alas!) thou canst not cut my bread. O feet (late) winged to pursue the slight Of hundred Armies that I foyl'd in fight, Now you haue lost your office, now (alas!) You cannot march, but limp about this place. But, 'tis the iust God, the iust hard of Heav'n His confession. In mine owne Coin hath me my paiment giuen: For, seventy Kings, thus maim'd of Toes and Thumbs, I, insolent, haue made to lick the crums Vnder my boord (like Dogs) and drawen perforce To serue for blocks when I should mount my horse. Therefore (O Kings!) by mine example learn His caueat to all Tyrants and cruell minded men. To bound your rage, limit you fury stream: O Conquerers! be warned all by me; Be to your Thralls, as God to you shall be: Men, pitty Man, wretched and ouer-throwen; And think his case may one-day be your owne; For, chance doth change: and none aliue can say, He happy is, vntill his dying day: The Foe that after Victorie survives, Not for himself but for your glorie liues: Th'Oliue's aboue the Palm: and th'happiest King His greatest Triumph, is Self-triumphing. But Israel, wallowing in his myre again, Israel again &amp; againe relapseth. Soon lost the glory former Arms did gain; And goods and bodies easie booties bin. To Aram Moab and the Philistin. What help (O Iacob)? th'hast nor arms, nor head: Thy Fields with bones of thine owne bands be spread, Again humble. And th'onely name of thy profaner Foe Congeals thy bloud, and chils thy heart for Wo. Flee, flee, and hy thee quickly to recover The all-proof Target of thine ancient Lover, Thy gracious God, the glorious Tyrant-tamer, Terror of terrors, Heathen's dreadfull hammer. Again &amp; again releeued.Ah! see already how he rescues thee From th'odious yoak of Pagan Tyranny; Breaking the Fetters of thy bondage fel, By Ahod, Barac, and Othoniel, Sangar a plow-swam: a famous Champion of Israel.And Goad-man Sangar, whose industrious hand With Ox-teem tills his tributary Land. When Philistins, with Sword and fiery Fury, Slaughter the Iews, and over-run all Iury, Deflowr the Virgins, and with lust-full spight Ravish chaste Matrons in their Husbands sight, He leaves his Plough, he calls vpon his God; And, onely armed with his slender Goad, Alone he sets on all the Heathen Camp. A Pagan Captain weens him thus to damp; What means this Fool (saith he)? go, silly Clown, Get thee to Plough, go home, and till thy ground, Go prick thy Bullocks; leave the Works of Mars To my long-train'd, still-conquering souldiers. First learn thou Dog (replies the Israelite) To knowe my strength (rather th'Almighties might): And on his head he laies him on such load With two quick vennies of his knotty Goad, And with the third thrusts him between the eies, That down he falls, shaking his heels, and dies. Then steps another forth more stout and grim, Shaking his Pike, and fierce lets flee at him: But Sangar shuns the blowe; and, with his stroak, The Pagan leg short-off in sunder broak; On th'other yet, a while he stands and fights: But th'Hebrew Champion such a back-blowe smites, That flat he layes him; then, with fury born, Forward he leaps; and, in a Martiall scorn, Vpon his panch sets his victorious foot, And treads, and tramples, and so stamps into 't, That blood and bowels (mingled with the bruise) Half at his mouth, half at his sides, he spews: As on Wine-hurdles those that dance (for meed) Simile.Make with sweet Nectar every wound to bleed, Each grape to weep, and crimsin streams to spin Into the Vate, set to receive them in. Thence thirty steps, a chief Commander prest, And proudly wags his feather-clouded Crest, And cries, Com hither (Cow-heard) come thou hither, Com, let vs cope, but I and thou together; I'll teach thee (peasant) and that quickly too, Thou hast not with thy fellow swains to doe, That on Mount Carmel's stormy top do feed. No, heer (poor sot) thou other fence shalt need. Sangar runs at him: and he runs so fierce, That on his staf, him six steps back he beares; Beares down another with him, and another, That but with gesture stood directing other: As, when 'tis dark, when 't rains, and blusters rough, Simile. A thund'ring tempest with a sulphury puff Breaks down a mighty Gate, and that another, And that a third, each opposite to other: Smoak, dust, and door-falls, with storms roaring din, Dismay the stoutest that command within; The common sort (beside their little wits) Scar'd from their beds, dare not abide the streets: But, in their shirts over the walls they run, And so their Town, yet it be ta'en, is wun; The suddain Storm so inly-deep dismaies-them, That fear of Taking to despair betrays them. Amid their Hoast, then brauely rushes Sangar, His sinnewy arm answers his sacred Anger: Who flies, or follows, he alike besteads: On scattered heape of slaughtered Foes he treads. This with his elbow heer he over-turns, That with his brow; this, with his foot he spurns; Heer, with his staff he makes in shivers fly Both cask and scull, and there he breaks a thigh, An arm, a leg, a rib, a chin, a cheek; And th'hungry Shepheard hardly beats so thick Nuts from a Tree, as Sangar Foes beats down: With swords, and shields, and shafts, the Field is sowen: Comparison. Alone he foils a Camp: and on the Plain There six hundred of the Heatben slain. Almightie God, how thou to thine art good! Thy peoples Foes are not alone subdu'd By a rude Clown, whose hard-wrought hands, before Nothing but soades, coulters and bills had bore: But, by a silly Woman, to whose hand Thou for a time committest the Command Of Israel: for, of no other Head, Nor Law, nor Lord they for a time are sped, But prudent Debora: vnto whose Throne Fly those whose heads with age are hoary growen, DEBORA. And those great Rabbies that do grauely sit, Revolving volumes of the highest Writ, And He that in the Tabernacle serues, Her sacred voyce as Oracles obserues: None from her presence ever coms confus'd. And gotten skill, giues place to skill infus'd. O Iacob's Lanthorn Load-star pure, which lights On these rough Seas the rest of Abramites (Said then the People) what shall vs befall? Iabin's fell yoak our weary necks doth gall: We are the Butts vnto all Pagan darts, And colde Despair knocks at our doors (our hearts). Israel, saith shee, be of good cheer; for now God wars vpon your Foes, and leagues with you: Therefore to Field now let your youth aduance, And in their rests couch the revenging Lance: Barac.This said, on Barac she a Shield bestowes, Indented on the brims, which plain fore-showes His shield giuen by Debora.In curious Boss-work (that doth neatly swell) The (won and lost) Battails of Israel, As an abbridgement, where to life appear The noblest Acts of eight or nine score year. Lo, heer an army, stooping by the side Gedeon.Of a deep River (with their Thirst half dry'd) Sups, licks, and laps the Stream; of all which rour, The Captain chuses but three hundred out; And arming each but with a Trump and Torch, About a mighty Pagan Hoast doth march, Making the same, through their drad sodain found, With their owne Arms themselues to inter-wound: A hellish rage of mutuall fury swels The bloudy hearts of barbarous Infidels, So that the friends that in one Couch did sleep, Each others blade in eithers brest do steep: And all the Camp with head-less dead is sowen, Cut-off by Cozen-swords, kill'd by their owne. Iephthe.Lo there, another valiant Champion, Who having late triumphant Laurels won; His heed-less Vow (in-humane) to ful-fill, His onely Daughter doth vnkindly kill: The frantik Mother, all vnbraç't (alas!) With silver locks vnkemb'd about her face; Arming her rage with nails, with teeth, and tongue, Runs-in, and rushes through the thickest throng: And, she will saue, and she will haue (she sayes) Her Deer, her Daughter; and then hold she layes Vpon the Maid: and tearing-off her Coat, Away she runs, thinking she her had got. The Priest dissolues in tears, th'Offring is chearfull; The Murdred's valiant, and the Murderer fearfull; The Father leads with slowe and feeble pase, The Daughter seems to run to death a-pace; As if the Chaplet that her temples ties, Were Hymen's Flowrs, not Flowrs for Sacrifice: Her grace and beauties still augment; (in fine) Whoso beholds her sweet, loue-darting Eyn, Her Cheeks, Lips, Brow's; fresh Lillies, Coral, Iet, He sees, or seems to see) a Sun to set. And (to conclude) the Graver, Maul, and Mould; Haue given such life to th'Iron, Brass, and Gold, That heer wants nothing but the Mothers screech, The Father's sigh, and the sweet Daughter's speech. Loe heer, another shakes his vnshav'n tresses, Triumphing on a Lion torn in peeces: Samson. O match-less Champion! Pearl of men-at-arms, That emptiest not an Arcenal of Arms, Nor needest shops of Lemnian Armourers, To furnish weapons for thy glorious Wars: An Asse's Iaw bone is the Club wher-with Thy mighty arm, brains, beats, and battereth Th'vncircumcised Camp: all quickly scud; And th'Hoast that flew in dust, now flowes in bloud. Heer, th'Iron Gates, whose hugeness wont to shake The massie Towrs of Gaza, thou doost take On thy broad shoulders: there (in seeming iest) Crushing their Palace-pillars (at a feast) Thou over-whelm'st the House, and with the fall The Philistims blaspheming Princes all. Heer, from ones head, which two huge coins do crush, (As whay from Cheese) the battred brains do gush: Heer lies another in a deadly swoune; Nail'd with a broken rafter to the ground: Another, heer pasht with a paine of wall, Hath lost his soule, and bodies shape withall: Ano her, heer o're-taken as he fled, Lies (Tortois-like) all hidden but the head: Another, covered with a heap of lome, Seems with his mooving to re-moue his Toomb: Even as the soft, blinde, Mine-inventing Moule, Simile. In velvet Robes vnder the Earth doth roule, Refusing light, and little ayr receives, And hunting worms her mooving hillockes heaves. Lo, lower heer, a beastly Multitude The Leuites wife. On one poor Woman all their lusts intrude; Whose Spouse (displeas'd with th'execrable Fact) Into twelues Peeces her dead Body hackt; And, to twelve Parts of Israel them transfers, As twelue quick tinders of intestin Wars. The Arke taken by the Philistines.And lower yet behold (with hatefull scorn) The Ark of God to Dagon's Temple born; But, th'Idol yeelds to God, and Dagon falls Before the Ark, which Heathen's pride appalls. The Battaile betweene the Israelites and Assyrians with their tron Chariots. Barac thus arm'd, th'Asorians sets-vpon, That bright in brass, steel gold, and silver shone: But, his young Soldiers were much daunted tho, To see the fearfull Engins of the Foe; Nine hundred chariots, whirling swift and light, Whose glistering irons dazle even their sight; Whose barbed Steeds bear in their heads a Blade Of the right temper of Damascvs made (As proud of it as Vnicorns are wont Of their rich Weapon that adornes their Front) Amidst their Pettral stands another Pike: On either-side, long grapples (Sickle-like) The like at either Nave: so that (in Wars) 'Tis present death t'approach these broaching Cars. Debora comforteth and incourageth the Israelites.But Debora, her Troops encouraging, Bestirs her quick, and steps from wing to wing: Courage (sayth she) brave Souldiers, sacred Knights, Strike, and strike home, lay on with all your mights: Stand, fear them not (O Champions of the Faith) God drives your Foes into the snares of Death. Doubtless, they are your owne: their armed Charrets They are but Buggs to daunt deiected spirits. No, no (my Hearts) not Arms, nor Engines glorious, But 'tis the heart that makes a Camp victorious: Or rather, 'tis God's Thunder-throwing hand, Which onely doth all Warr's success command: And, Victorie's his Daughter whom he now (For his owne sake) frankly bestowes on you. Simile.Even as a sort of Shepheards, having spi'd A Wolf com stealing down a Mountains side, Cry shrill, Now-now, vp-hill, a Wolf, a Wolfe; Now, now (sayes Eccho) vp-hill, a Wolf, a Wolf; And such a noyse between the Vales doth rise, That th'hungry Thief thence without hunting flies: So th'Hebrews, heartned with her brave Discourse, Gave such a showt, that th'armed Carrs and Horse Turn suddain back, their Drivers Art deceiue; And, changing side, through their owne Army cleave. Gods enemies ouerthrowen by their owne Engines.Som, with the blades in every Coursers brow, Were (as with Launces) bored through and through: Som torn in peeces with the whirling wheels: Som trod to death vnder the Horses heels: As (in som Countries) when in Season hot, Vnder Horse feet (made with a whip to trot) They vse to thresh the sheaves of Winter-Corn, Simile. The grain spurts-out, the straw is bruis'd and torn. Som (not direct before the Horse, nor vnder) Were with the Scithes mow'n in the midst a-sunder: Simile. As in a Mead the Grass, yet in the flowr, Falls at the foot of the wide-straddling Mower, That with a stooping back, and stretched arm, Cuts-cross the swathes to winter-feed his Farm. If there rest any resolute and loth To lose so soon their Arms and honors both At first assault, but rather brauely bent To see so fierce and bloudy Fight's event; Both Debora and Barac thither pli'd: But (as 'tis writ of the milde Amramide, And Nvn's great Son, that Heav'n-deer Mars-like man, Debora prayes while Barac fights. Who did transplant the Tribes to Canaan) She (in the zeale of her religious spirit) Lifts-vp her hands to pray, and he to fight. He charges fierce, he wounds, he slaughters all The Infidels vtterly ouerthrown, and Sisara their Captaine slain by Iahel. But Sisara, their Captain generall; Who flies to Iahel, and by her is slain Driving a nail into his sleeping brain. At last, the Helm of head-strong Israel Coms to the hand of famous Samvel; One rarely-wise, who weds his Policy, To divine gifts of sacred Prophecie: Samuel, Iudge. But, his two greedy Sons, digressing quite From his good steps, dis-taste the Israelite Of th'ancient Rvle of th'Heav'nly Potentate: So that all seek a suddaine Change of State. Israel askes a KING. Assembled then in sacred Parliament, Vp starts a Fellow of a mean Descent (But of great spirit, well-spoken, full of wit, And courage too, aspiring high to sit) And having gain'd attention, thus he sayes: 1. A Declamati? of a Plebeian or Democracie or People Sway. Divine Designe! O Purpose worthy-prayse, To now-Reform the State, and soundly heal With holsom Lawes th'hurts of the Common weal: But (prudent Israel) take now heed or never); Change not an Ague for a burning Fever; In shaking-off confused Anarchie, To be intiç't t'imbrace a Monarchie, Admir'd of Fools, ador'd of Flatterers, Of Softlings, Wantons, Braves, and Loyterers: The Freedom and Defence of the base Rabble; But, to brave mindes a Yoak intolerable. For, who can brook millions of men to measure Breath, Life, and Mooving, all at One man's pleasure? One, to keep all in aw? One at a beck A whole great Kingdom to controule and check? Is't not a goodly sight, to see a Prince, Void of all Vertue, full of insolence, To play with Noble States, as with a straw? A Fool, to give so many Wise the Law? A Beast, to govern Men? An infant, Eld? A Hare to lead fierce Lions to the Field? The corruption &amp; licentiousnes of most Prosces Courts.Who is't but knowes, that such a Court as this, Is th'open Shop of selling Offices? Th'harbour of Riot, stews of Ribaldry, Th'haunt of Profusion, th'Hell of Tyranny: That no-where shines the Regal Diadem, But (Comet-like) it boads all vice extreme? That not a King among ten thousand Kings, But to his Lust his Law in bondage brings? But (shame-less) triumphs in the shame of Wives? But bad, prefers the bad, and good deprives? But gildeth those that glorifie his Folly; That sooth and smooth, and call his Hell-ness holy But with the Torrent of continuall Taxes (Pour'd every-where) his meanest Subiects vexes Simile.As an ill-stated Body doth distill On's feeblest parts his cold-raw humors stil. That Form of Rvle is a right Common weal, Where all the People haue an Enter-deal: Where (with-out aw or law) the Tyrants sword Is not made drunk with bloud, for a Miss-word: Where, Each (by turn) doth Bid and doth Obey; Where, still the Commons (hauing Soverain-sway) Share equally both Rigour and Reward To each-man's merit: giving no regard To ill-got Wealth, nor mouldy Monuments From great-great-Grand-sires scutcheon'd in Descents Where, Learned men, vn-soule-clogd (as it were) With servile giues of Kings imperious Fear, Fly euen to Heav'n; and by their Pens inspire Posterity with Vertue's glorious Fire: Where, Honour's honest Combat never ceasses, Nor Vertue languishes, nor Valour leeses His sprightfull nerves, through th'Enuy of a Prince, That cannot brook another's excellence; Or, Pride of those, who (from great Elders sprung) Haue nothing but Their glory on their tongue; And deeming Others Worth, enough for them, Vertue and Valour, and all Arts contemn: Or, base Despair, in those of meaner Calling, Who on the ground still (woorm-like) basely crawling, Dare not attempt (nor scarcely think, precise) Any great Act or glorious Enterprise; Because Ambition, Custom, and the Law, From high Estate hath bounded them with aw: Where, He that neuer rightly learn'd t'obay Commandeth not, with heavy Sword of Sway: Where, each i'th'Publik having equall part, All to save all, will hazard life and hart: Where, Liberty (as deer as life and breath) Born with vs first, consorts vs to our death. Shall savage Beasts like-better Nuts and Mast Simile. In a free Forrest, than our choise Repast In iron Cages? and shall we (poor Sots) Whom Nature Masters of our selues allots, And Lords of All besides; shall we go draw On our owne necks an ease-less Yoak of Aw? Rather (O Iacob) chuse we all to die, Than to betray our Native Libertie; Than to becom the sporting Tennis-ball Of a proud Monarch; or to yeeld vs thrall To serve or honor any other King Than that drad Lavv which did from Sina ring. Another then, whom Age made venerable, 2. Another, of a reverend Senator for Aristocracy or the rule of a chosen Synode of the best men. Knowledge admir'd, and Office honorable, Stands-vp, and speaks (maiestically-milde) On other Piles the Common-Weal to build. Doubt-less (said he) with waste of Time and Soap, Y'have labour'd long to wash an Æthiope: Y'have drawn vs heer a goodly form of State (And well we have had proof of it of late): Shall we again the Sword of Ivstice put In mad mens hands, soon their owne throats to cut? What Tiger is more fierce? what Bear mor fel? Comparison. What Chaff more light? What Sea more apt to swel Than is th'vnbridled Vulgar, passion-toss't; In calms elated, in foul-weather lost? What boot deep Proiects, if to th'eyes of all They must be publisht in the common Hall? Sith knowen Designes are dangerous to act: And, th'vn-close Chief did never noble fact. Democracy is as a tossed Ship, Simile. Void both of Pole and Pilot in the deep: A Senate fram'd of thousand Kinglings slight; Where, voices pass by number, not by waight; Where, wise men do propound, and Fools dispose: A Fair, where all things they to sale expose: Simile. A Sink of Filth, where ay th'infamousest, Simile. Most bold and busie, are esteemed best: Simile.A Park of savage Beasts, that each-man dreads: A Head-less Monster with a thousand heads. What shall we then do? shall we by and by In Tyrants paws deiect vs servilely? Nay, rather, shunning the extremities, Let vs make choise of men vpright and wise; Of such whose Vertue doth the Land adorn, Of such whom Fortune hath made Noble-born, Of such as Wealth hath rais'd above the pitch Of th'obiect Vulgar; and to th'hands of such (Such as for Wisdom, Wealth, and Birth excell) Let vs commit the Reans of Israel; And ever from the sacred Helm exclude The turbulent, base, moody Multitude. Take away Choice, and where is Vertue's grace? What? shall not Chance vnto Desert give place? Simile.And Lots, to Right? Shall not the blinde be led By those whose eyes are perfect in their head? Chiefly, amid such baulks, and blocks and Pits, As in best State-paths the best States-man meets? Comparison.Who may be better trusted with the key Of a great Chest of Gold and gems than they That got the same? And who more firm and fit At carefull Stern of Policie to sit, Than such as in the Ship most venture bear: Such as their owne wrack with the State's wrack fear: Such as, Content, and hauing Much to lose, Even Death it selfe, rather than Change, would choose? 3. The Oration of a Noble yong Prince for Monarchy or the sole Soveraintie of a KING.While he discourst thus on a Theam so grave, Vp-rose a Gallant, noble, young, and brave, Fo to the Vulgar, one that hop't (perchance) One-day t'attain a Scepters governance, And thus he speaks: Your Rvle is yet too Free. Y'have proin'd the leaves, not boughs of Publik-Tree: Y'have qualifide, but not yet cur'd our Grief: Y'have in our Field still left the tares of Strife, Of Leagues, and Factions. For, plurality Of Heads and Hands to sway an Emperie, Is for the most part like vntamed Bulls: Simile.One, this way hales: another, that way pulls: All every-way; hurried with Passion's windes Whither their Lust-storms do transport their mindes; At length-the strongest bears the weakest down, And to himself wholly vsurps the Crown: And so (in fine) your Aristocracie He by degrees brings to a Monarchie. In brief, the Scepter Aristocratike: And People-sway, have A passion following any sicknesse. Symptomes both alike: And neither of them can be permanent For want of Vnion; which of Gouernment Is both the Life-bloud, and Preservatiue, Wherby a State, yong, strong, and long doth thrive. But, Monarchy is as a goodly Station, Built skilfully, vpon a sure Foundation: A quiet House, wherin (as principall) One Father is obey'd and serv'd of all: A well-rigd Ship, where (when the danger's neer) A many Masters strive not who shall steer. The world hath but One God: Heav'n but One Sun: Quails but One Chief: the Hony-birds but One One Master-Bee: and Nature (natively) Graves in our hearts the Rule of Monarchy. At sound of whose Edicts, all ioynt-proceed: Vnder whose Sway, Seditions never breed: Who, while consulting with Colleagues he stands, Lets not the Victory escape his hands: And, that same Maiesty, which (as the Base And Pedestal) supports the waight and grace, Greatnes and glory of a well-Rul'd State, Is not extinguisht nor extenuate, By being parcelliz'd to a plurality Of petty Kinglings, of a mean Equality: Simile. Like as a goodly River, deep and large, Able to bear Ships of the greatest Charge, If, through new Dikes, his trade-full Waters guided, Be in a hundred little brooks divided; No Bridge more fears, nor Sea more waighs the same: But soon it loses both his trade and name. And (to conclude) a wise and worthy Prince, A KING, compleat in Royall excellence, Is even the Peoples prop, their powrfull nerves, And lively Law, that all intire preserves: His Countrie's life, and soule, sight and fore-sight; And even th'Almightie's sacred Picture right. While yet he spake, the People loudly cri'd, A KING, a KING; wee'll have a KING for Guide, He shall command: He shall conduct our Hoasts, And make vs Lords of th'Idvmean Coasts. Ingrate, said Samvel will you then reiect Th'Almighties Scepter? do you more affect New Policy, than his olde Providence? And change th'Immortall for a mortall Prince? Well (Rebels) well, you shall, you shall have one: A KINGS Prerogatiue. But do ye knowe what follows there-vpon? He, from your Ploughs shall take your Horses out, To serve his Pomp, and draw his Train about In gilden Coaches (a wilde wanton sort Of Popiniayes and Peacocks of the Court): He shall your choisest Sons and Daughters take To be his Seruants (nay, his slaues to make): You shall plant Vineyards, he the Wine shall sup: You shall sowe Fields, and he shall reap the Crop: You shall keep Flocks, and he shall take the Fleece: And Pharao's Yoke shall seem but light to his. Saul anointed King of Israell.But, Israel doth wilfull perseuere, And Samvel (prest and importun'd euer) Anointeth Savl (the son of Cis) a Man Whose cursed end marr'd what he well began. You, too-too-light, busie, ambitious wits, That Heav'n and Earth confound with furious fits: A cheeck to busie, seditious Malcontents in any State.Fantastik Frantiks, that would innovate, And every moment change your form of State: That weening high to fly, fall lower still: That though you change your bed change not your Ill: See, See how much th'Almighty (the most High) Heer-in abhors your fond inconstancy. The authority of every kinde of Gouernment is from God.The People-State, the Aristocracy, And sacred KINGDOM, took authority A-like from Heav'n: and these three Scepter-forms Flourish a-vie, as well in Arts and Arms, As prudent Laws. Therefore, you stout Helvetians, Grisons, Genevians, Ragusins, Venetians, Tharefore every People to persist in the State established.Maintain your Liberties, and change not now Your sacred Laws rooted so deep with you. On th'other side, we that are borne and bred Vnder KINGS Aw, vnder one Supreame Head, Let vs still honor their drad Maiesties, Obey their Laws, and pay them Subsidies. Let's read, let's hear no more these factious Teachers, These shame-less Tribunes, these seditious Preachers, That in all places alwaies belch and bark Aloud abroad, or whisper in the dark, Railing at Princes (whether good or bad) The true Lieutenants of Almighty God. And let not vs, before a KING, prefer A Senate-sway, nor Scepter Popular. 'Tis better bear the Youth-slips of a KING, I'th' Law som fault, i'th' State som blemishing, Than to fill all with Blood-flouds of Debate; While, to Reform, you would Deform a State. One cannot (with-out danger) stir a stone In a great Building's olde foundation: And, a good Leach seeks rather to support, With ordered dyet, in a gentle sort, A feeble Body (though in-sickly plight) Than with strong Med'cines to destroy it quight. And therefore, Cursed, ever Cursed be Our A just Execration of the Popish Powder-Plot on the fifth of Nouember 1605. Hell-spurr'd Percie's fel Conspiracy; And every head, and every hand and hart, That did Conceiue or but Consent his part: Pope-prompted Atheists, faining Superstition, To cover Cruelty, and cloak Ambition: Incarnat Divels Enemies of Man, Dam Murdering Vipers, Monsters in-humane, Dis-natur'd Nero's, impious Erostrates, That with one Puff would blowe-vp all Estates; Princes and Peer's and Peoples Government (For all Three consists our Parliament.) Religion, Order, Honesty, and all, And more then all that Fear can fear to fall. And therefore, Blessed, ever Blessed be Our glorious GOD's immortall Maiesty; England's Great Watch-man he that Israel keeps, Who neuer slumbers and who neuer sleeps: Our gratious Father, whose still-firm affection Defends vs still with wings of his Protection: Our louing Sauiour, that thus Saues vs still (Vs so vnworthy, vs so prone to ill): Our sacred Comforter (the Spirit of Light) Who steers vs still in the True Faith aright) The Trinitie, th'Eternall Three in One, Who by his Powr and Prouidence alone, Hath from the Furnace of their Fiery Zeal Preserv'd our Prince, our Peers, our Pvblike-Weal, Therefore, O Prince (our nostrils deerest breath) Thou true Defender of true Christian Faith, O! let the Zeal of God's House eat thee vp: Fill Babylon her measure in her Cup: Maim the King maiming Kinglings of Bezec: Pittie not Agag spare not Amalech: Hunt, hunt those Fox's that would vnder-mine Root, Body, Branches of the Sacred Vine: O! spare them not. To spare Them is to spoil Thy Self thy Seed thy Subiects, and thy Soil. Therfore, O Peers, Prince-loyall Paladines, True-noble Nobles, lay-by by-Designes: And in God's quarrel and your Countries, bring Counsail and Courage to assist your KING To counter-mine against the Mines of Rome; To conquer Hydra, and to ouer-com And clean cut-off his Horns, and Heads, and all Whose hearts do Vow, or knees do Bow to Baal: Be Zealous for the Lord, and Faith-full now, And honor Him, and He will honour you. Fathers, and Brethren, Ministers of Christ, Cease civill Warrs: war all on Anti-Christ; Whose subtle Agents, while you strive for shels, Poyson the kernel with Erronious Spels: Whose Envious Seed-men, while you Silent Sleep, Sowe Tares of Treason, which take root too deep. Watch; watch your Fold: Feed, feed your Lambs at home: Muzzle these Sheep-clad bloudy Wolves of Rome. Therfore, O People, let vs Praise and Pray Th'Almighty-most (whose Mercy lasts for ay) To giue vs grace, to euer-keep in minde This Miracle of his Protection kinde: To true-Repent vs of our hainous Sin (Pride, Lust, and Looseness) we haue wallowed in: To stand still constant in the pure Profession Of true Religion (with a due discretion To try the Spirits, and by peculiar choice To knowe our Shepheards from th'Hyæna's voice): And, ever loyall to our Prince, t'expose Goods, Lands, and Liues, against his hate-full Foes: Among whom (Lord) if (yet) of Thine be found, Conuert them quickly; and the rest Confound. And (to Conclude) Prince, Peers, and People too, Praise all at once, and selfly each of you, His Holy Hand, that (like as long-agoe, His Sidrach, Misach and Abednego) From the hot Furnace of Pope-Powder'd Zeal Hath Sav'd our Prince, our Peers, our Pvblik-weal.

Iosuah Syluester. [DAVID.] [THE FOVRTH DAY OF THE SECOND WEEK.] The Tropheis. THE I. BOOK OF THE FOVRTH DAY OF the Second Week, of Bartas. The Argvment. Saul's fall from Fauour, into Gods Disgrace. Dauid design'd Successor in his Place: Brauing Goliah, and the Philistins He brauely foyles: He flyes his furious Prince. Seem-Samuel rais'd: Saul routed; Selfely-slain: King Dauids Tropheis, and triumphant Raign. His heauenly Harp-skill (in King Iames renewd): His humane frailty, heauily pursewd. Bersabe bathing: Nathan bold-reprouing: Dauid repenting (Our Repentance moouing). Saul king of Israell, fortunate at the first, is afterward reiected, and Dauid elected in his steed. Heröike force, and Prince-fit forme withall, Honor the Scepter of courageous Saul; Successe confirmes it: for the power Diuine Tames by his hand th'outrageous Philistine, Edom, and Moab, and the Ammonite, And th'euer-wicked, curst Amalekite: O too-too-happy lif his arrogance Had not transgrest Heauens sacred Ordinance: But therefore, God in 's secret Counsell (iust) Him euen alreadie from his Throne hath thrust, Degraded of his gifts; and in his steed (Though priuily) anointed Iesse's Seed, Th'honour of Iacob yea of th'Vniuerse, Heav'ns darling DAVID, Subiect of my Verse. Invocation.Lord, sith I cannot (nor I may not once) Aspire to DAVID's Diadems and Thrones; Nor lead behind my bright Triumphal-Car So many Nations Conquered in War: Nor (DAVID-like) my trembling Aspes adorn With bloody TROPHEIS of my Foes forlorn: Vouchsafe me yet his Verse: and (Lord) I craue Let me his Harp-strings, not his Bowe-strings haue; His Lute, and not his Lance, to worthy-sing Thy glory, and the honour of thy King. For, none but DAVID can sing DAVID's worth: Angels in Heav'n thy glory sound; in Earth, DAVID alone; whom (with Heav'ns loue surpriz'd) To praise thee there, thou now hast Angeliz'd. Giue me the Laurel, not of War, but Peace; Or rather giue me (if thy grace so please) The Ciuik Garland of green Oaken boughes, Thrice-three times wreath'd about my glorious browes, To euer-witnes to our after-frends How I haue rescew'd my con-Citizens, Whom profane Fames-Thirst day and night did moue To be beslau'd to th'yoake of wanton Loue: For (not to me, but to thee, Lord, be praise) Now, by th'example of my Sacred Layes, To Sacred Loues our noblest spirits are bent, And thy rich Name's their only Argument. HEE, WHOM in priuat wals, with priuy signe, The great King-maker did for King assigne, Begins to show hiwself. A fire so great Could not liue flame-less long: nor would God let So noble a spirits nimble edge to rust In Sheapheards idle and ignoble dust. My Son, how certain we that saying proue, Iesse (or Vshai) send th Dauid to see hubre thr? in the Campe. That doubtfull Fear still wayts on tender Loue? DAVID (saith Iesse) I am full of fears For thy deer Brethren: Each Assault, salt tears Draws from mine eyes; mee thinks each point doth stab Mine Eliah, Samna, and Aminadab. Therefore goe visite them, and with this Food Beare them my blessing; say I wish them good; Beseeching God to shield and them sustain, And send them (soon) victorious home again. Gladly goes DAVID, and anon doth spie Two steep high Hils where the two Armies lie, A Vale diuides them; where, in raging mood (Colossus-like) an armed Giant stood: Descryption of Goliah. His long black locks hung shagged (slouen-like) A-down his sides: his bush-beard floated thick; His hand and arms, and bosom bristled were (Most Hedge-hog-like) with wyer insteed of haire. His foul blasphemous mouth, a Caues mouth is; His eyes two Brands, his belly an Abysse: His legs two Pillars; and to see him go, He seemd som steeple reeling to and fro. A Cypresse-Tree, of fifteen Summers old, Pyramid-wise waues on his Helm of gold. Whose glistring brightnes doth (with rayes direct) Against the Sun, the Sun it self reflect; Simile.Much like a Comet blazing bloodie-bright Ouer som City, with new threatfull light, Presaging down-fall or som dismal fate, Too-neer approoching to som ancient State. His Lance a Loom-beam, or a Mast (as big) Which yet he shaketh as an Osier twig; Whose harmfull point is headed stifly-straight With burnisht Brasse aboue an Anuils waight: Vpon whose top (in stead of Bannaret) A hissing Serpent seems his foes to threat: His brazen Cuirasse, not a Squire can carrie; For 'tis the burthen of a Dromedarie: His Shield (where Cain his brother Abel slaies, Where Chus his son, Heav'n-climbing Towrs doth raise; Where th'Ark of God, to the' Heathen captiuate, To Dagon's House is led with scorne and hate) Is like a Curtain made of double planks To saue from shot some hard-besieged Ranks. His threatfull voice is like the stormefull Thunder When hot-cold Fumes teare sulphury clowds asunder. His brauing Defiance to the Hoast of Israell.O Fugitiues! this is the forti'th day (Thus barkes the Dog) that I haue stalked aye About your fearefull Hoast: that I alone Against your best and choisest Champion, In single Combat might our Cause conclude, To shun the slaughter of the multitude. Come then, who dares; and to be slaine by mee, It shall thine honour and high Fortune bee. Why am I not less strong? my common strength Might find some Braue to cope with at the length. But, phy for shame, when shal we cease this geare: I to defie, and you to fly for feare? If your hearts serue not to defend your Lot, Why are you arm'd? why rather yeeld you not? Why rather doe you (sith you dare not fight) Not proue my mildnesse, than prouoke my might? What needed Coats of brasse and Caps of steele For such as (Hare-like) trust but to their heele? But, sith I see not one of you (alas!) Alone dares meet, nor looke me in the face, Come tenne, come twenty, nay come all of you, And in your ayde let your great God come too: Let him rake Hell, and shake the Earth in sunder, Let him be arm'd with Lightning and with Thunder: Come, let him come and buckle with me heer: Your goodly God, lesse then your selues, I feare. Thus hauing spewd, the dreadfull Cyclop stirr'd His monstrous Limbes; beneath his feet he reard A Clowd of dust: and, wherefoe're he wend, Flight, Feare, and Death, his ghastly steps attend. Euen as a payr of busie chattering Pies, Simile. Seeing some hardie Tercell from the skies To stoop with rav'nous seres, feele a chill feare, From bush to bush, wag-tayling here and there; So that no noyse, nor stone, nor stick can make The timorous Birds their Couert to forsake: So th'Hebrew Troopes this brauing Monster shun; And from his sight, som here, som there, do run. In vain the King commands, intreats and threats; And hardly three or foure together gets. What shame (saith he) that our Victorious Hoast Saul stirreth up his Souldiers, and proposeth ample Reward to him that shall vndertake the Philistine. Should all be daunted with one Pagans boast? Braue Ionathan, how is thy courage quaild? Which, yerst at Boses, all alone assaild Th'whole Heathen Hoast. O Worthy Abner too, What chance hath cut thy Nerues of Valour now? And thou thy selfe (O Saul) whose Conquering hand Had yerst with Tropheis filled all the Land, As far as Tigris, from the Iaphean Sea: Where is thy heart? how is it fall'n away? Saul is not Saul: O! then, what Izraelite Shall venge God's honor and Our shame acquite? Who, spurr'd with anger, but more stird with zeale, Shall foile this Pagan, and free Izrael? O! who shall bring me this Wolf's howling head, That Heav'n and Earth hath so vn-hallowed? What e're he be, that (lauish of his soule) Shall with his blood wash-out this blot so foule, I will innoble him, and all his House; He shall inioy my Daughter for his Spouse: And euer shall a Deed so memorable Be (with the Saints) sacred and honorable. Yet for the Duel no man dares appeer: All wish the Prize; but none will win't so deer: Big-looking Minions, braue in vaunts and vows, Lions in Court, now in the Camp be Cows: But, euen the blast that cools their courage so, That makes my DAVD's valiant rage to glowe. Dauids offer.My Lord (saith He) behold, this hand shall bring Th'Heav'n-scorning head vnto my Lord the King. Alas, my Lad, sweet Shepheard (answers Saul) Thy heart is great; although thy lims be small: High flie thy thoughts; but we haue need of more, More stronger Toyls to take so wilde a Boare: To tame Goliah, needs som Demi god, Som Nimrod, rather then a Shepheard-Lad Of slender growth, vpon whose tender Chin The budding doun doth scarcely yet begin. Keep therfore thine owne Rank, and draw not thus Death on thy self, dis-honour vpon vs, With shame and sorrow on all Israel, Through end-less Thraldom to a Fo so fel. His assurance.The faintest Harts, God turns to Lions fierce, To Eagles Doues, Vanquisht to Vanquishers: God, by a Womans feeble hand subdews Iabins Lieutenant, and a Iudge of Iews. God is my strength: therefore (O King) forbear, For Israel, for thee, or mee, to fear: No self-presumption makes me rashly braue; Assured pledge of his prowd head I haue. Seest thou these arms, my Lord? These very arms (Steeld with the strength of the great God of Arms) Haue bath'd Mount Bethlem with a Lions blood: These very arms, beside a shady wood, Haue slain a Bear, which (greedy after prey) Had torn and born my fattest sheep away. My God is still the same: this sauage Beast, Which in his Fold would make a Slaughter-feast, All-ready feels his fury and my force; My foot al-ready tramples on his Corps: With his own sword his cursed length I lop, His head already on the ground doth hop. The Prince beholds him, as amaz'd and mute To see a mind so yong, so resolute: Then son (saith he) sith so confirm'd thou art, Go, and Gods blessing on thy valiant hart; God guide thy hand, and speed thy weapon so, That thou return triumphant of thy Fo. Hold, take my Corslet, and my Helm, and Launce, And to the Heav'ns thy happy Prowes aduance. The faithfull Champion, being furnisht thus, Is like the Knight, which twixt Eridanus And th'heav'nly Star-Ship, marching brauely-bright (Hauing his Club, his Casque, and Belt bedight With flaming studs of many a twinkling Ray) Turns Winters night into a Summers day. But, yet that he had half a furlong gon, The massie Launce and Armour hee had on Did load him so, he could not freely mooue His legs and arms, as might him best behooue. Euen so an Irish Hobby, light and quick Simile. (Which on the spur ouer the bogs they prick In highest speed) If on his back he feel Too-sad a Saddle plated all with steel, Too-hard a Bit with-in his mouth; behind, Crooper and Trappings him too-close to binde; He seems as lame, he flings and will not go; Or, if he stir, it is but stiff and slowe. DAVID therefore lays-by his heauy load; And, on the grace of the great glorious GOD (Who by the weakest can the strongest stoop) Hee firmly founding his victorious hope, No Arrows seeks, nor other Arcenall; But, from the Brooke that runnes amid the Vale, Hee takes fiue Pebbles and his Sling, and so, Courageously incounters with his Foe. What Combat's this? On the one side, I see A moouing Rocke, whose looks do terrifie Euen his owne Hoast; whose march doth seem to make The Mountaine tops of Sucoth euen to shake: On th'other side, a slender tender Boy Where grace and beautie for the prize doo play; Shaue but the doun that on his Chin doth peer, And one would take him for Anchises Pheer: Or, change but weapons with that wanton Elf, And one would think that it were Cupids self. Gold on his head, scarlet in either Cheek, Grace in each part and in each gest, alike; In all so louely, both to Foe and Friend, That very Enuy cannot but commend His match-less beauties: and though ardent zeale Flush in his face against the Infidel, Although his Fury fume, though vp and down He nimbly trauerse, though he fiercely frown, Though in his breast boyling with manly hear, His swelling heart do strongly pant and beat; His Storme is Calm, and from his modest eyes Euen gratious seems the grimmest flash that flies. Am I a Dog, thou Dwarf, thou Dandiprat, To be with stones repell'd and palted at? Or art thou weary of thy life so soon? O foolish boy! fantasticall Baboone! That never saw'st but sheep in all thy life; Poore sotte, 'tis heer another kind of strife: We wrastle not (after your Shepheards guise) For painted Sheep-hooks, or such pettie Prize, Or for a Cage, a Lamb, or bread and chese: The Vanquisht Head must be the Victors Fees. Where is thy sweatie dust? thy sun-burnt scars (The glorious marks of Soldiers train'd in Wars) That make thee dare so much? O Lady-Cow, Thou shalt no more be-star thy wanton brow With thine eyes rayes: Thy Mistress shall no more Curl the quaint Tresses of thy Golden ore: I'll trample on that Gold; and Crowes and Pyes Shall peck the pride of those sweet smiling eyes: Yet, no (my girle-boy) no, I will not 'file My feared hands with blood so faintly-vile: Go seek thy match, thou shalt not dy by me, Thine honor shall not my dishonor be: No (silly Lad) no, wert thou of the Gods, I would not fight at so vn-knightly ods. Com barking Curre (the Hebrew taunts him thus) That hast blasphem'd the God of Gods, and vs; The ods is mine (villain, I scorne thy Boasts) I haue for Aide th'almighty Lord of Hoasts. Th'Ethnik's a-fire, and from his goggle eyes All drunk with rage and blood, the Lightning flies: Out of his beuer like a Boare he fomes: A hellish fury in his bosom roames: As mad, he marcheth with a dreadfull pase, Death and destruction muster in his face: He would a-fresh blaspheam the Lord of Lords With new despights; but in the steed of words Simile.He can but gnash his teeth. Then as an Oxe Straid twixt the hollow of steep Hils and Rocks, Through craggie Coombs, through dark and ragged turnings, Lowes hideously his solitary Moornings: The Tyrant so from his close helmet blunders With horrid noise, and this harsh voyce he thunders: Thy God raigns in his Ark, and I on Earth: I Chalenge Him, Him (if he dare come forth) Not Thee, base Pigmee. Villain (sayes the Iew) That blasphemy thou instantly shalt rue. Simile.If e'r you saw (at Sea) in Summer weather, A Galley and a Caraque cope togither (How th'one steets quick, and th'other veers as slowe, Lar boord and star-booord from the poop to prowe: This, on the winde; that, on her owres relies: This daunteth most; and that most damnities) You may conceiue this Fight: th'huge Polypheme Stands, stifly shaking his steel-pointed beam: Dauid doth trauerse (round about him) light, Forward and back, to th'left hand, and the right, Steps in and out; now stoops, anon he stretches; Then here coyls, on eyther hand he reaches; And stoutly-actiue, watching th'aduerse blowes, In euery posture dooth himself dispose. As, when (at Cock-pit) two old Cocks doo fight, Simile. (Bristling their plumes, and (red with rage) do smite With spurs and beak, bounding at euery blowe, With fresh assaults freshing their fury so, That, desperate in their vn-yeelding wrath, Nothing can end their deadly fewd but death) The Lords about, that on both sides do bet, Look partially when th'one the Field shall get, And, trampling on his gaudy plumed pride, His prostrate Fo with bloody spurs bestride, With clanging Trumpet and with clapping wing, Triumphantly his Victory to sing: So th'Hebrew Hoast, and so the Heathen stranger (Not free from fear, but from the present danger) Behold with passion these two Knights on whom They both haue wagerd both their Fortunes summ And eyther side, with voice and gesture too, Hartens and cheers their Champion well to doo; So earnest all, hat almost euery one Seems euen an Actor, not a looker-on. All feel the skirmish twixt their Hope and Fear: All cast their eyes on this sad Theater: All on these two depend as very Founders Of their good Fortune, or their Fates Confounders. O Lord, said David (as he whirld his Sling) Be bowe and Bowe-man of this shaft I fling. With sudden flerk the fatal hemp lets go The humming Flint, which with a deadly blowe Pearç't instantly the Pagans gastly Front, As drop as Pistol sho in boord is wont. The villain's sped (cryes all the Hebrew band) The Dog, the Atheist feels Gods heauy hand. Th'Isacian Knight, seeing the blowe, stands still. Goliah ouerthrowne. Fro th'Tyrants wound his ruddy soule doth trill; As from a crack in any pipe of Lead (That conuoyes Water from som Fountains head) Simile. Hissing in th'Aire, the captiue Stream doth spin Insiluer threds her crystall humour thin. The Giant, wiping with his hand his wound, Cries Tush, 't is nothing: but eftsoones the ground Sunk vnder him, his face grew pale and wan, And all his limbs to faint and fail began: Thrice heaues he vp his head; it hangs as fast, And all a-long lies Isaac's dread at last, Couering a rood of Land; and in his Fall, Simile.Resembles right a lofty Tower or Wall, Which to lay leuel with the humble soil A hundred Miners day and night doo toil; Till at the length rushing with thundrous roar, It ope a breach to th'hardy Conquerour. Then, two lowd cries, a glad and sad, were heard: Wherwith reviv'd the vaunting Tyrant stird, Resummoning vnder his weak Controule The fainting Remnants of his flying Soule; And (to be once more buckling yer he dies, With blowe for blowe) he striues in vain to rise Sach as in life, such in his death he seems; For euen in death he curses and blasphemes: And as a Curre, that cannot hurt the flinger, Flies at the stone and biteth that for anger; Goliah bites the ground and his owne hands Simile.As Traytors, false to his fel hearts commands. Then th'Hebrew Champion heads the Infidel With his own sword, and sends his soule to Hell. Pagans disperse; and the Philistian swarms Haue Armes for burthen, and haue flight for Armes; Danger behinde, and shame before their face; Rowting themselues, although none giue them chase. Dauids Thanks giuing for the victorie.Armi-potent, Omnipotent, my God, O let thy Praise fill all the Earth abroad; Let Israel (through Thee, victorious now) Incessant songs vnto thy glory vow: And let me Lord (said DAVID) euer chuse Thee sole, for Subiect of my sacred Muse. O wondrous spectacle! vnheard-of Sight! The Monster's beaten down, before the Fight: A Dwarf, a Shepheard, conquers (euen vnarmd) A Giant fell, a famous Captain, armd. From a frail Sling this Battery neuer came, But 'twas the Breach of a Tower-razing Ram: This was no cast of an vncertain Slinger, 'Twas Crosse-bow-shot: rather it was the finger Of the Al-mightie (not this hand of mine) That wrought this work so wondrous in our eyne: This hath He done, and by a woman weak Can likewise stone the stout Abimelech: Therefore, for euer, singing sacred Layes, I will record his glorious Power and Praise. Then, Iacob's Prince him ioyfully imbraces, Prefers to honours, and with fauours graces, Imployes him farre and nigh; and farre and neere, From all sad cares he doth his Soueraine cleer. In camp he curbs the Pagans arrogance: In Court he cures the Melancholy Transe That toyls his soule; and, with his tunefull Lyre, Effects of Musick. Expels th'll Spirit which doth the body tyre. For, with her sheath, the soule commerce frequents, And acts her office by his instruments; After his pipe she dances: and (again) The body shares her pleasure and her paine; And by exchange, reciprocally borrowes Som measure of her solace and her sorrowes. Th'Eare (doore of knowledge) with sweet warbles pleas'd, Sends them eftsoons vnto the Soule diseas'd, With dark black rage, our spirits pacifies, And calmly cools our inward flame that fries. So, O Tyrtéus, changing Harmonie, Examples of the same. Thy Rowt thou changest into Victorie. So, O thrice-famous, Princely Pellean, Holding thy hart's reanes in his Tune-full hand, Thy Timothie with his Melodious skill Armes and dis-armes thy Worlds-drad arme (at will), And with his Phrygian Musicke, makes the same As Lion fierce; with Dorick, milde as Lambe. So, while in Argos the chaste Violon For's absent Soueraine doth graue-sweetly groan, Queen Clytemnestra doth resist th'alarmes Of lewd Ægysthus, and his lustfull Charmes. So, at the sound of the sweet-warbling brasse, The Prophet rapting his soule's soule a space, Refines himself, and in his phantasie Graues deep the seal of sacred Prophecie. For, if our Soule be Number (som so thought) It must with number be refreshed oft; Or, made by Number (so I yeeld so sing) We must the same with som sweet Numbers bring To som good Tune: euen as a voice (somtime) That in its Part sings out of tune and time, Simile. Is by another voice (whose measur'd strain Custom and Art confirms) brought in again. It may be too, that Davids sacred Ditty Quickned with Holy Writ, and couched witty, Exorcist-like, chaç't Natures cruell Foe, Who the Kings soule did toss and torture so. How e'r it were, He is (in euery thing) A profitable seruant to the King: Who enuious yet of his high Feats and Fame, His Faith, and Fortitude, distrusts the same: And, the diuine Torch of his Vertues bright Brings him but sooner to his latest Night; Saue that the Lord still shields him from on hy, And turns to Tryumph all his Tragedy. O bitter sweet! I burst (thus raues the King) Sauls Envy to Dauid.To hear them all, in Camp and Court to sing, Savl he hath slaine a thousand, David ten, Ten thousand David. O faint scorn of men! Lo how, with Lustre of his glorious parts, He steals-away the giddy peoples hearts; Makes lying Prophets sooth him at a beck; Thou art but King in name, He in effect: Yet thou indur'st it; haste thee, haste thee (Sot) Choak in the Cradle his aspiring Plot; Preuent his hopes, and wisely-valiant Off with his head that would thy foot supplant. Nay, but beware; his death (belov'd so wel) Will draw thee hatred of all Izrael. Sith then so high his heady valour flies, Sith common glory cannot him suffice, Sith Danger vpon Danger he pursews, And Victorie on Victorie renewes; Let's put him to 't: Let's make him Generall, Feed him with winde, and hazard him in all: So shall his owne Ambitious Courage bring For Crown a Coffin to our Iunior King: Yea, had he Sangars strength, and Samsons too, He should not scape the taske I'll put him to. But yet, our David more then all atchieues, And more and more his grace and glory thriues: The more he doos, the more he dares aduenture, His rest-less Valour seeks still new Aduenture. For, feeling him armd with th'Almighty's Spirit, He recks no danger (at the least to fear it). Then, what doos Saul? When as he saw no speed By sword of Foes so great a Foe to rid, He tries his owne: and one-while throwes his dart, At vn-awares to thrill him to the heart: Or treacherously he layes som subtill train, At boord, or bed, to haue him (harm-less) slain: On nothing else dreams the disloyall wretch, But Dauids death; how Dauid to dispatch. Which had bin don, but for his Son the Prince Ionathan's loue to Dauid.(Who deerly tenders Dauids Innocence, And neerly marks and harks the Kings Designes, And warns the Iessean by suspect-less signes) But for the kinde Courageous Ionathan, Who (but attended onely with his man) Neer Senean Rocks discomfited, alone, The Philistines victorious Garison. About his eares a Shower of Shafts doth fall; His Shield's too-narrow to receiue them all: His sword is duld with slaughter of his Foes, Wherefore the dead he at the liuing throwes: Head-lined helmes, heawn from their trunks he takes, And those his vollies of swift shot he makes. The Heathen Hoast dares him no more affront, Late number-less; but, easie now to count. Dauid therefore, flying his Princes Furie, From end to end flies all the Land of Iurie: But now to Nob; t'Adullam then, anon To Desart Zif, to Keilah, Maaon, Hauing for roof heav'ns arches starry-seeld; And, for repast, what wauing woods doe yeeld. The Tyrant (so) frustrate of his intent, Wreakes his fell rage vpon the innocent; If any winke, as willing t'haue not seen-him, Or if (vnweeting what's the oddes between-him And th'angry King) if any had but hid-him: He dies for it (if any haue but spid-him): Yea the High-Priest, that in Gods presence stands, Escapeth not his paricidiall hands; Nor doth he spare in his vnbounded rage, Cattel, nor Curre, nor state, nor sexe, nor age. Contrariwise, Dauid doth good for ill, He Hates the haters of his Soueraine still. And though he oft incounter Saul lesse strong Then his owne side; forgetting all his wrong, He shewes him, aye, loyall in deed and word Vnto his Liege, th'Anointed of the Lord; Respects and honors him, and mindes no more The Kings vnkindness that had past before. One day as Saul (to ease him) went aside Into a Caue, where Dauid wont to hide, Dauid (vn-seen) seeing his Foe so neer And all alone, was strook with suddain fear, As much amaz'd and musing there-vpon; When whispering thus his Consorts egge him on: Who sought thy life is fall'n into thy lap; Doo'st thou not see the Tyrant in thy Trap? Now therfore pull this Thorne out of thy foot: Now is the Time if euer thou wilt doo't: Now by his death establish thine estate: Now hugge thy Fortune yer it be too-late: For, he (my Lord) that will not, when he may, Perhaps he shall not, when he would (they say). Why tarriest thou? what dost thou trifle thus? Wilt thou, for Saul, betray thy self and vs? Wonne with their words, to kill him he resolues But, by the way thus with himself revolues: He is a Tyrant. True: But now long since, Anti-Bellærmin &amp; his Disciples Authors or Fautors of our Powder-mine.And still, he bears the mark of lawfull Prince: And th'Ever-King (to whom all Kings doe bow) On no pretext, did euer yet allow That any Subiect should his hand distain In sacred blood of his owne Souerain. He hunts me cause-less. True: but yet, Gods word Bids me defend, but not offend my Lord. I am anointed King; but (at Gods pleasure) Not publikely: therfore I wait thy leasure. For, thou (O Lord) regardest Thine, and then Reward'st, in Fine, Tyrants and wicked men. Thus hauing sayd, he stalkes with noise-less foot Behind the King, and softly off doth cut A skirt or lap of his then-vpper clothing; Then quick auoydes: and Saul, suspecting nothing, Comes forth anon: and Dauid afterward From a high Rock (to be the better heard) Cries to the King (vpon his humble knee) Come neer (my Liege) com neer and fear not me, Fear not thy seruant Dauid. Well I knowe, Thy Flatterers, that miss-inform thee so, With thousand slanders daily thee incense Against thy Seruants spot-less innocence: Those smooth-sly Aspicks, with their poisony sting Murder mine honor, me in hatred bring With thee and with thy Court (against all reason) As if Convicted of the Highest Treason: But my notorious Loyalty (I hope) The venom of their Viperous tongues shall stop; And, with the splendor of mine actions bright, Disperse the Mists of Malice and Despight. Behold, my Lord, (Trueth needeth no excuse) What better witnesse can my soule produce Of faithfull Loue, and Loyall Vassalage, To thee, my Liege, than this most certain gage? When I cut-off this lappet from thy Coat, Could I not then as well haue cut thy throat? But rather (Souerain) thorow all my veins Shall burning Gangrens (spreading deadly pains) Benum my hand, then it shall lift a sword Against my Liege, th'anointed of the Lord; Or violate, with any insolence, Gods sacred Image in my Soverain Prince. And yet (O King) thy wrath pursues me still; Like silly Kid, I hop from hill to hill; Like hated Wolues, I and my Souldiers starue: But, iudge thy self, if I thy wrath deserue. No (my Sonne Dauid) I haue don thee wrong: Good God requite thy good: there doth belong A great Reward vnto so gratious deed. Ah, well I see it is aboue decreed That thou shalt sit vpon my Seat supream, And on thy head shalt wear my Diadem: Then, O thou sacred and most noble Head Remember Mee and mine (when I am dead): Be gratious to my Blood, and raze not fell My Name and Issue out of Israel. Thus sayd the King; and tears out-went his words: A pale despair his heauy hart still-girds: His feeble spirit præsaging his Mis-fortune, Doth euery-kinde of Oracles importune; Suspicious, seeks how Clotho's Clew doth swell; And, cast of Heav'n, wil needs consult with Hell. In Endor dwelt a Beldam in those daies, Deep-skild in Charms (for, this weak sex always The Woman Witch of Endor. Hath in all Times been taxt for Magik Tricks, As pronest Agents, for the Prince of Styx: Whether, because their soft, moist supple brain, Doth easie print of euery seal retain: Or, whether wanting Force and Fames desart, Those Wyzards ween to winn it by Black-Art.) This Stygian scum, the Furies fury fell, This Shop of Poysons, hideous Type of Hell, This sad Erinnys, Milcom's Fauourite, Chamosh his Ioye, and Belzebubs delight, Delights alonely for her exercise In secret Murders, sodain Tragœdies; Her drink, the blood of Babes; her dainty Feast Mens Marrow, Brains, Guts, Livers (late deceast). At Weddings aye (for Lamps) she lights debates; And quiet Loue much more then Death she hates: Or if she reak of Love, 'tis but to trap Som severe Cato in incestuous Lap. Somtimes (they say) she dims the Heav'nly Lamps She haunts the Graues, she talks with Ghosts, she stamps And Cals-vp Spirits, and with a wink controules Th'infernall Tyrant, and the tortur'd Soules. Arts admiration, Izraels Ornament, That (as a Queen) Command'st each Element, And from the Toomb deceased Trunks canst raise, (Th'vnfaithfull King thus flatters her with praise) On steepest Mountains stop the swiftest Currents, From driest Rocks draw rapid-rowling Torrents, And fitly hasten Amphitrites Flood, Or stay her Eb (as to thy selfsems good): Turn day to night: hold windes within thy hand, Make the Sphears moue, and the Sun still to stand: Enforce the Moon so with thy Charms som-times, That for a stound in a deep Swoun she seems: O thou al-knowing Spirit! daign with thy spell To raise-vp heer renowned Samuel, To satisfie my doubtfull soule, in sum, The issue of my Fortunes yet to-com. Importun'd twice or thrice, she, that before Resembled one of those grim Ghosts (of yore) Which she was wont with her vn-holsom breath To re-bring-back from the black gates of death, Growes now more gastly, and more Ghost-like grim, Right like to Satan in his Rage-full Trim. The place about darker then Night she darkes, Shee yelles, she roars, she houles, she brayes, she barkes, And, in vn-heard, horrid, Barbarian tearms, She mutters strange and execrable Charmes; Of whose Hell-raking, Nature-shaking Spell, These odious words could scarce be hearkned well: Eternall Shades, infernall Dëities, Death, Horrors, Terrors, Silence, Obsequies, Demons, dispatch: If this dim stinking Taper Be of mine owne Sons fat; if heer, for paper, I write (detested) on the tender skins Of time-less Infants, and abortiue Twins (Torn from the wombe) these Figures figure-less: If this black Sprinkle, tuft with Virgins tress, Dipt, at your Altar, in my kinsmans blood; If well I smell of humane flesh (my food): Haste, haste, you Fiends: you subterranean Powr's: If impiously (as fits these Rites of yours) I haue inuok't your grizly Maiesties, Harken (O Furies) to my Blasphemies, Regard my Charms and mine inchanting Spell, Reward my Sins, and send vp Samuel From dismall darknes of your deep Abysse, To answer me in what my pleasure is: Dispatch, I say, (black Princes) quick, why when? Haue I not Art, for one, to send you ten? When? stubborn Ghost! The Palfraies of the Sun Doo fear my Spells; and, when I spur, they run: The Planets bow, the Plants giue-ear to me, The Forrests stoop, and even the strongest Tree, At driery sound of my sad whisperings, Doth Prophecie, foretelling future things: Yea (maugre Ioue) by mine almighty Charms, Through Heav'n I thunder with imperious Arms And comst not thou? O, so: I see the Sage, I see th'ascent of som great man: his age, His sacred habite, and sweet graue aspect Som God-like raies about him round reflect: Hee's ready now to speak, and plyant too To cleer thy doubtings, without more adoo. Saul flat adores; and wickedly-deuout, The fained Prophets least word leaues not out. What dost thou Saul? O Izraels Soverain, Against those that resort to Witches. Witches, of late, feard only thy disdain: Now th'are thy stay. O wretch doost thou not knowe One cannot vse th'ayde of the Powers belowe Without som Pact of Counter-Seruices, By Prayers, Perfumes, Homage, and Sacrifice? And that this Art (meer Diabolicall) It hurteth all, but th'Author most of all? And also, that the impious Athëist, The Infidel, and damned Exorcist, Differ not much. Th'one, Godhead quite denies: Th'other, for God, foul Satan magnifies: The other, Satan (by Inchantment strange) Into an Angell of the Light doth change. When as God would, his voice thou wouldst not hear; Now he forbids thee, thou consult'st els-where: Whom (liuing Prophet) thou neglect'st, abhorr'st, Him (dead) thou seck'st, and his dead Trunk ador'st: And yet, not him nor his; for th'ougly Fiend Hath no such power vpon a Saint t'extend, Who fears no force of the blasphemous Charms Of mumbling Beldams, or Hels damned Arms: Against th'illusion of Sathans false Apparitions and Walking Spirits. From all the Poysons that those powers contriue, Charm-charming Faith's a full Preseruatiue. In Soule and Body both, He cannot come; For, they re-ioyne not till the day of doom: His Soule alone cannot appeer; for why, Soules are invisible to mortall eye: His Body only, neither can it be; For (dust to dust) that soon corrupts (we see). Besides all this, if t'were true Samuel, Should not (alas) thine eyes-sight serue as well To see and knowe him, as this Sorceresse, This hatefull Hag, this old Enchanteresse, This Divell incarnate, whose drad Spell commands The rebell-Fury of th'Infernall Bands? Hath Lucifer not Art enough to fain A Body fitting for his turn and train? Simile.And (as the rigor of long Cold congeals To harsh hard Wooll the running Water-Rils) Cannot he thicken thinnest parts of Air, Commixing Vapours? glew-them? hue them fair? Simile.Even as the Rain-Bowe, by the Suns reflexion Is painted faire in manifold complexion: A Body, which we see all-ready formd; But yet perceiue not how it is performd: A Body, perfect in apparant showe; But in effect and substance nothing so: A Body, hartless, lung-less, tongue-less too, Where Satan lurks, not to giue life ther to; But to the end that from this Counter-mure, More couertly he may discharge more sure A hundred dangerous Engins, which he darts Against the Bulwarks of the bravest hearts: That, in the Sugar (euen) of sacred Writ, He may em-pill vs with som bane-full bit: And, that his counterfait and fained lips, Laying before vs all our hainous slips, And Gods drad Iudgements and iust Indignation, May vnder-mine our surest Faiths Foundation. But, let vs hear now what he saith. O Saul, What frantick fury art thou moov'd with-all, To now re-knit my broken thrid of life? To interrupt my rest? And 'mid the strife Of struggling Mortals, in the Worlds affairs (By power-full Charms) to re-entoyl my Cares? Inquir'st thou what's to-come? O wretched Prince! Too much, too-soon (what I fore-told long since): Death's at thy door: to-morrow Thou and Thine Even all shall fall before the Philistine: And great-good Dauid shall possesse thy Throne, As God hath sayd, to be gain-sayd by none. How Sathan comes to tell things to-come.Th'Author of Lies (against his guise) tels true: Not that at-once he Selsly all fore-knew, Or had revolv'd the Leaues of Destiny (The Childe alonly of Eternity): But rather through his busie obseruation Of circumstance, and often iteration Of reading of our Fortunes and our Fals, In the close Book of cleare Coniecturals, With a far-seeing Spirit; hits often right: Not much vnlike a skilfull Galenite, Who (when the Crisis comes) dares even foretell Whether the Patient shal do ill or well. Or, as the Star-wise somtimes calculates (By an Eclipse) the death of Potentates; And (by the stern aspects of greatest Stars) Prognosticates of Famine, Plague, and Wars. As he foretold (in brief) so fell it out: Saules death. Braue Ionathan and his two Brethren stout Are slain in fight; and Saul himselfe forlorn, Lest (Captiue) he be made the Pagans scorn, He kils him-Self; and, of his Fortune froward, To seem not conquer'd, shewes him Self a Coward. For, 'tis not Courage (whatsoe'r men say) But Cowardize to make ones Self away. Against Self-killing. Tis even to turne our back at Fears alarms: Tis (basely-faint) to yeeld vp all our Arms. O extreame Rage! O barbarous Cruelty, All at one Blowe, t'offend Gods Maiesty, The State, the Magistrate, Thy selfe (in fine): Th'one, in destroying the deer work divine Of his almightie Hands, the next, in reauing Thy needfull Seruice, it should be receiuing; The third, in rash-vsurping his Commission; And last, Thy Self, in thine owne Selfs-Perdition, When (by two Deaths) one voluntarie Wound Doth both thy body and thy soule confound. But Isbosheth (his deer Son) yet retains His Place a space, and Dauid only Raigns In happy Iuda. Yet, yer long (discreet) He makes th'whole Kingdoms wracked ribs to meet: And so He rules on th'holy Mount (a mirror) His Peoples Ioy, the Pagans only Terror. If ever standing on the sandy shoar, Y'haue thought to count the rowling waues that roar Comparison. Each after other on the British Coast, When Æolus sends forth his Northern Poast; Waue vpon Waue, Surge vpon Surge doth fold, Sea swallowes Sea, so thickly-quickly roul'd, That (number-less) their number so doth mount, That it confounds th'Accompter and th'Accompt: So Dauid's Vertues when I think to number, Their multitude doth all my Wits incumber; That Ocean swallowes me: and mazed so, In the vast Forest where his Prayses growe, I knowe not what high Fir, Oak, Chest-nut-Tree. (Rather) what Brasil, Cedar, Ebonie My Muse may chuse (Amphion-like) to build With curious touch of Fingers Quauer-skild (Durst she presume to take so much vpon-her) A Temple sacred vnto Dauids honour. Epitome of Dauids Vertues.Others shall sing his mindes true Constancie, In oft long exiles try'd so thorowly: His life compos'd after the life and likeness Of sacred Patterns: his milde gracious meeknes Towards railing Shimei, and the Nabal. Churlish Gull; His louely Eyes and Face so bewtifull. Som other shall his equity record, And how the edge of his impartiall sword Is euer ready for the Reprobate, To hewe them down; and help the Desolate: How He no Law, but Gods drad Law enacts: How He respects no persons, but their Facts: How braue a Triumph of Selfs-wrath he showes, Killing the Killers of his deadly Foes. Som other shall vnto th'Empyreall Pole The holy fervour of his zeal extoll: How for the wandring Ark he doth prouide A certain place for euer to abide: And how for euer euery his designe Is ordered all by th'Oracle Diuine. Vpon the wings of mine (els-tasked) Rime, Through the cleer Welkin of our Western clime, I'll only bear his Musike and his Mars (His holy Songs, and his triumphant Wars): Lo there the sacred mark wherat I aim; And yet this Theam I shall but mince and maim, So many Yarnes I still am faine to strike Into this Web of mine intended Week. Of his valour and victories.The Twelue stout Labours of th'Amphitrionide (Strongest of Men) are iustly magnifi'd: Yet, what were They but a rude Massacre Of Birds and Beasts, and Monsters here and there? Not Hoasts of Men and Armies ouerthrow'n; But idle Conquests; Combats One to One: Where boist'rous Limbs, and Sinnews strongly knit, Did much auaile with little ayde of Wit. Bears, Lions, Giants, foild in single fight, Are but th'Essayes of our redoubted Knight: Vnder his Armes sick Aram deadly droops: Vnto his power the strength of Edom stoops: Stout Amalek euen trembles at his name: Prowd Ammons scorn he doth return with shame: Subdueth Soba: foyls the Moabite: Wholly extirps the down-trod Iebusite; And (still victorious) every month almost Combats and Conquers the Philistian Hoast: So that, Alcides massie Club scarce raught So many blowes, as Dauid Battails fought. Th'expert Great Pompey. Captain, who the Pontiks quaild, Wun in strange Wars; in ciuill Fights he faild: But, Dauid thriues in all: and fortunate, Triumphs no lesse of Sauls intestine hate, Of Isbosheth's and Absalon's designes, Then of strong Aram, and stout Philistines. Good-Fortune alwaies blowes not in the Poop Of valiant Cæsar, she defeats his Troop, Slayes his Lieutenants; and (among his Friends) Stabb'd full of Wounds, at length his Life she ends: But Dauid alwaies feels Heav'ns gratious hand; Whether in person He himself command His royall Hoast: or whether (in his sted) By valiant Ioab his braue Troops be led: And Happinesse, closing his aged eye, Even to his Toomb consorts him constantly. Fair Victory, with Him (even from the first) Did pitch her Tent: his Infancy she nurst With noble Hopes, his stronger years she fed With stately Trophets, and his hoary head She Crowns and Comforts with (her cheerfull Balms) Triumphant Laurels and victorious Palms. The Mountains stoop to make him easie way; And Euphrates, before Him, dryes away: To Him great Iordan a small leap doth seem; Without assault, strong Cities yeeld to Him: Th'Engine alone of His far-feard Renown Bears (Thunder-like) Gates, Bars, and Bulwarks down: Gads goodly Vales, in a gore Pond he drenches; Philistian Fires, with their owne Bloud he quenches; And then, in Gob (pursewing still his Foes) His wrath's iust Tempest on fell Giants throwes. O strong, great Worthies) will som one-day say, When your huge Bones they plough vp in the Clay) But, stronger, greater, and more Worthie He, Whose Heav'n-lent Force and Fortune made you be (Maugre your might, your massy Spears and Shields) The fatt'ning dung-hill of those fruitfull Fields. His Enimies, scarcely so soon he threats As ouerthrowes, and vtterly defeats. On Dauids head, God doth not spin good-hap; But pours it down aboundant in his Lap: And He (good subiect) with his Kingdom, ever T'increase th'Immortall Kingdom doth endeuour. His swelling Standards neuer stir abroad, Till he haue Cald vpon th'Almighty God: He neuer Conquers but (in heav'nly Songs) He yeelds the Honor where it right belongs: And evermore th'Eternals sacred Prayse (With Harp and Voice) to the bright Stars doth raise. His Poesie.Scarce was he born, when in his Cradle prest The Nightingale to build her tender nest: The Bee within his sacred mouth seeks room To arch the Chambers of her Hony-comb: And th'Heav'nly Muse, vnder his roof descending (As in the Summer, with a train down-bending, We see som Meteor, winged brightly-fair With twinkling rayes, glide through the crystall Aier, And soudainly, after long-seeming Flight, To seem amid the new-shav'n Fields to light) Him softly in her Iuory arms she folds, His smiling Face she smilingly beholds: She kisses him, and with her Nectar kisses Into his Soule she breathes a Heav'n of Blisses; Then layes him in her lap: and while she brings Her Babe a-sleep, this Lullabie she sings. VRANIA's Lullaby.Liue, liue (sweet-Babe) the Miracle of Mine, Liue euer Saint, and growe thou all Divine: With this Celestiall Winde, where-with I fill Thy blessed Boosom, all the World ful-fill: May thy sweet Voice, in Peace, resound as far And speed as fair as thy drad Arm in War: Bottom nor bank, thy Fames-Sea never bound: With double Laurels be thy Temples Crownd. See (Heav'n-spring Spirit) see how th'allured North, Of thy Childs-Cry (shrill-sweetly warbling forth) Al-ready tastes the learned, dainty pleasures. See, see (yong Father of all sacred Measures) See how, to hear thy sweet harmonious sound, About thy Cradle here are thronging (round) Woods, but with ears: Floods, but their fury stopping: Tigres, but tame: Mountains, but alwaies hopping: See how the Heav'ns, rapt with so sweet a tongue, To list to thine, leaue their owne Dance and Song. O Idiot's shame, and Envy of the Learned! O Verse right-worthy to be ay eterned! O richest Arras, artificiall wrought With liueliest Colours of Conceipt-full Thought! O royall Garden of the rarest Flowers Sprung from an Aprill of spirituall Showers! O Miracle! whose star-bright beaming Head When I behold, euen mine owne Crown I dread. Excellency of the Psalmes of Dauid.Never els-where did plentious Eloquence, In euery part with such magnificence Set-forth her Beauties, in so sundry Fashions Of Robes and Iewels (suting sundry Passions) As in thy Songs: Now like a Queen (for Cost) In swelling Tissues, rarely-rich imbost With Pretious Stones: neat, City-like, anon, Fine Cloth, or Silk, or Chamlet puts she on: Anon, more like som handsom Shepheardesse, In courser Cloaths she doth her cleanly dresse: What-e're she wear, Wool, Silk, or Gold, or Gems, Or Course or Fine; still like her Self she seems; Fair, Modest, cheerfull, fitting time and place, Illustring all even with a heav'n-like grace. Like prowd loud Tigris (ever swiftly roul'd) Now, through the Plains thou powr'st a Flood of gold: Now, like thy Iordan, (or Meander-like) Round-winding nimbly with a many-Creek, Thou runn'st to meet thy self's pure streams behind thee. Mazing the Meads where thou dost turn and winde-thee. Anon, like Cedron, through a straighter Quill, Thou strainest out a little Brook or Rill, But yet, so sweet, that it shall ever be Th'immortall Nectar to Posterity: So cleer, that Poesie (whose pleasure is To bathe in Seas of Heav'nly Mysteries) Her chastest feathers in the same shall dip, And deaw with-all her choicest workmanship: And so deuout, that with no other Water Deuoutest Soules shall quench their thirst heer-after. Of sacred Bards Thou art the double Mount: Of faith-full Spirits th'Interpreter profound: Of contrie Hearts the cleer Anatomy: Of euery Sore the Shop for remedy: Zeal's Tinder-box: a Learned Table, giuing To spirituall eyes, not painted Christ, but living. O diuine Volume, Sion's cleer deer Voice, Saints rich Exchecker, full of comforts choice: O, sooner shall sad Boreas take his wing At Nilus head, and boist'rous Auster spring From th'icie floods of Izeland, than thy Fame Shall be forgot, or Honour fail thy Name: Thou shalt surviue through-out all Generations, And (plyant) learn the Language of all Nations: Nought but thine Aiers through air and Seas shall sound, In high-built Temples shall thy Songs resound, Thy sacred Verse shall cleer Gods clowdy face, And, in thy steps the noblest Wits shall trace. Grosse Vulgar, hence; with hands profanely-vile, So holy things presume not to defile, Touch not these sacred stops, these silver strings: This Kingly Harp is only meet for Kings. And so behold, towards the farthest North, Ah see, I see vpon the Banks of FORTH (Whose force-full stream runs smoothly serpenting) A valiant, learned, and religious King, Whose sacred Art retuneth excellent This rarely-sweet celestiall Instrument: And Dauids Truchman, rightly doth resound (At the Worlds end) his eloquence renown'd. Dombertans Clyde stands still to hear his voice: Stone-rowling Tay seemes thereat to reioyce: The trembling Cyclads, in great Lummond-Lake, After his sound their lusty gambols shake: The (Trees-brood) Bar-geese, mid th'Hebridian wave, Vnto his Tune their far-flow'n wings doo wave: And I my Self in my pyde A kind of light mantle made of a thin checkerd Cloth, worne by the Hil-men in Scotland: and now much vsed with vs for Saddle clothes. Pleid a-slope, With Tune-skild foot after his Harp doo hop. Thus, full of God, th'Heav'n Sirene (Prophet-wise) Powres-forth a Torrent of mel-Melodies, In Davids praise. But Davids foule defect Was yet vn-seen, vncensur'd, vn-suspect. Oft in fair Flowers the bane-full Serpent sleeps: Somtimes (we see) the brauest Courser trips: And som-times Dauid's Deaf vnto the Word Of the Worlds Ruler, th'everlasting Lord: His Songs sweet feruor slakes, his Soules pure Fire Is dampt and dimm'd with smoak of foul desire: His Harp is layd a-side, he leaues his Layes, And after his fair Neighbors Wife he neighs. Fair Bersabe's his Flame, euen Bersabe, In whose Chaste bosom (to that very day) Honour and Loue had happy dwelt together, In quict life, without offence of either: But, her proud Bewty now, and her Eyes force, Began to draw the Bill of their Diuorce: Honor giues place to Loue: and by degrees Fear from her hart. Shame from her forehead flees. The Presence-chamber, the High street, the Temple These Theaters are not sufficient ample To shew her Bewties, if but Silke them hide: Bersabe bathing.Shee must haue windowes each-where open wide About her Garden-Baths, the while therin She basks and bathes her smooth Snowe-whiter skin; And one-while set in a black Iet-like Chair, Perfumes, and combes, and curls her golden hair: Another-while vnder the Crystall brinks, Her Alabastrine well-shap't Limbs she shrinks Like to a Lilly sunk into a glasse: Like soft loose Venus (as they paint the Lasse) Born in the Seas, when with her eyes sweet-flames, Tonnies and Triton, she at-once inflames: Or like an Iuory Image of a Grace, Neatly inclos'd in a thin Crystall Case: Another-while, vnto the bottom diues, And wantonly with th'vnder-Fishes striues: For, in the bottom of this liquid Ice, Made of Musäick work, with quaint deuice The cunning work-man had contriued trim Carpes, Pikes, and Dolphins seeming even to swim. Ishai's great son, too-idly, walking hie Dauid gazing. Vpon a Tarras, this bright star doth spy; And sudden dazled with the splendor bright, Fares like a Prisoner, who new brought to light From a Cymmerian, dark, deep dungeon, Feels his sight smitten with a radiant Sun. But too-too-soon re-cleer'd, he sees (alas) Th'admired Tracts of a bewitching Face. Her sparkling Eye is like the Morning Star: Her lips two snips of crimsin Sattin are: Her Teeth as white as burnisht siluer seem (Or Orient Pearls, the rarest in esteem): Her Cheeks and Chin, and all her flesh like Snowes Sweet intermixed with Vermillion Rose, And all her sundry Treasures selfly swell, Prowd, so to see their naked selues excell. What liuing Rance, what rapting Ivory Swims in these streams? O what new Victory Triumphs of all my Tropheis? O cleer Therms, If so your Waves be cold; what is it warms, Nay, burns my hart? If hot (I pray) whence comes This shivering winter that my soule benums, Freezes my Senses, and dis-selfs me so With drousie Poppey, not my self to knowe? O peer-less Bewty, meerly Bewtifull; (Vnknow'n) to me th'art most vn-mercifull: Alas! I dy, I dy (O dismall lot!) Both for I see thee, and I see thee not But a-far-off and vnder water too: O feeble Power, and O (what shall I doo?) Weak Kingly-State! sith that a silly Woman Stooping my Crown, can my soule's Homage summon But, O Imperiall power! Imperiall State! Could (happy) I giue Bewties Check the Mate. Thus spake the King: and, like a sparkle small That by mischance doth into powder fall, Simile. Hee's all a-fire; and pensiue, studies nought, But how t'accomplish his lasciuious thought: Which soon he compast; sinks himself therin; Forgetteth Dauid; addeth Sin to Sin: And lustfull, plaies like a young lusty-Rider Simile.(A wilfull Gallant, not a skilfull guider) Who, proud of his horse pride, still puts him to't: With wand and spur, layes on (with hand and foot) The too-free Beast; which but too-fast before Ran to his Ruine, stumbling euermore At euery stone, till at the last he break Against som Rock his and his Riders neck. For, fearing, not Adulteries fact, but fame: A iealous Husbands Fury for the same: And lessening of a Pleasure shar'd to twain: He (treach'rous) makes her valiant Spouse be slain. The Lord is moov'd: and, iust, begins to stretch His Wraths keen dart at this disloiall wretch: When Nathan (then bright Brand of Zeal and Faith). Comes to the King, and modest-boldly sayth: The Prophet Nathan's Parable, reprouing Dauid.Vouchsafe my Liege (that our chief Iustice art) To list a-while to a most hainous part. First to the fault giue ear: then giue Consent To giue the Faulty his due punishment. Of late, a Subiect of thine owne, whose flocks Powl'd all Mount Liban's pleasant plentious locks; And to whose Heards could hardly full suffice The flowry Verge that longst all Iordan lies; Making a feast vnto a stranger-Guest, None of his owne abundant Fatlings drest; But (priuy Thief) from a poor neighbour by (His faithfull Friend) Hee takes feloniously A goodly Lamb; although he had no more But euen that one: wherby he set such store, That every day of his owne hand it fed, And every night it coucht vpon his Bed, Supt of his Cup, his pleasant morsels pickt, And euen the moisture from his lips it lickt. Nay, more, my Lord. No more (replies the King, Deeply incenst) 'Tis more then time this thing Where seen into; and so outrageous Crimes, So insolent, had need be curbd betimes: What ever Wretch hath done this Villany Shall Die the Death; and not alonely Die, But let the horror of so foul a Fact A more then common punishment exact. O painted Toomb (then answerd sacred Nathan) That hast God in thy Mouth, in thy Minde Sathan: Thou blam'st in other thine owne Fault denounç't, And vn-awares hast 'gainst thy self pronounç't Sentence of Death, O King, no King (as then) Of thy desires: Thou art the very man: Yea, Thou art hee, that with a wanton Theft Hast iust Vriah's only Lamb bereft: And him, O horror! (Sin with Sin is further'd) Him with the sword of Ammon hast Thou murther'd. Bright Beauties Eye, like to a glorious Sun, Hurts the sore eye that looks too-much ther-on: Thy wanton Eye, gazing vpon that Eye, Hath given an entrance too-too-foolishly Vnto that Dwarf, that Divell (is it not?) Which out of Sloath, within vs is begot; Who entring first but Guest-wise in a room, Doth shortly Master of the house become; And makes a Saint (a sweet, mylde minded Man) That 'gainst his Life's Foe would not lift his hand, To plot the death of his deer faith-full Friend, That for his Loue a thousand liues would spend. Ah! snak'st thou not? is not thy Soule in trouble (O brittle dust, vain shadow, empty bubble!) At Gods drad wrath, which quick doth calcinize The marble Mountains and the Ocean dries? No, thou shalt knowe the waight of Gods right hand, Thou, for example t'other Kings shalt stand. Death, speedy Death, of that adulterous Fruit, Which even al-ready makes his Mother rue't, Shall vex thy soule, and make thee feel (indeed) Forbidden Pleasure doth Repentance breed. Ah shame-less beast! Sith thy brute Lust (forlorn) Hath not the Wife of thy best Friend forborn, Thy Sons (dis-natur'd) shall defile thy bed Incestuously; thy fair Wiues (rauished) Shall doublely thy lust-full seed receaue: Thy Concubines (which thou behinde shalt leaue) The wanton Rapes of thine owne Race shall be: It shall befall that in thy Family, With an vn-kins-mans kisse (vn-louing Louer) The Brother shal his Sisters shame discouer: Thou shalt be both Father and Father-in-law To thine owne Blood. Thy Children (past all aw Of God or Man) shall by their insolence. Euen iustifie thy bloody soul offence. Thou sinn'dst in secret: but Sol's blushing Eye Shall be eye-witness of their villany: All Izrael shall see the same: and then, The Heav'n-sunk Cities in Asphaltis Fen, Out of the stinking Lake their heads shall showe, Glad, by thy Sons, to be out-sinned so. Thou, thou (inhumane) didst the Death conspire Of good Vriah (worthy better Hire), Thou cruell didst it: therefore, Homicide, Cowardly treason, cursed Paricide, Vn-kinde Rebellion; euer shall remain Thy house-hold Guests, thy house with blood to stain, Thine owne against thine owne shall thril their darts: Thy Son from thee shall steal thy peoples harts: Against thy Self he shall thy Subiects arm, And giue thine age many a fierce Alarm, Till hanged by the hair 'twixt Earth and sky (His Gallow's pride, shame of the Worlds bright Eye) Thine owne Lieutenant, at a crimsin spour, His guilty Soule shall with his Lance let-out. And (if I fail not) O what Tempest fel Beats on the head of harm-less Izrael! Alas! how many a guiltless Abramide The Plague of Pestilence.Dies in Three dayes, through thy too-curious Pride! In hate of thee, th'Air (thick and sloathful) breeds No slowe Disease; both yong and old it speeds; All are indifferent: For through all the Land It spreads, almost in turning of a hand: To the so-sick, hard seem the softest plumes; Flames from his eys, from's mouth come Iakes-like fumes: His head, his neck; his bulk, his legs doth tire; Outward, all water; inward, all a-fire: With a deep Cough his spungy Lungs he wastes: Black Blood and Choler both at once he casts: His voices passage is with Biles be-layd, His Soule's Interpreter, rough, foul, and flayd: Thought of the Grief it's rigor oft augments: 'Twixt Hope and Fear it hath no long suspense: With the Disease Death iointly trauerseth: Th'Infections stroak is euen the stroak of Death. Art yeelds to th'anguish: Reason stoops to rage: Physicians skill, himselfe doth ill engage. The streets too still: the Town all out of Town: All Dead, or Fled: vnto the hallowed ground The howling Widdow (though she lov'd him deer) Yet dares not follow her dead Husbands Beer. Each mounts his Losse, each his owne Case complains, Pel-niel the liuing with the dead remains. Simile.As a good-natur'd and wel-nurtur'd Chyld, Found in a fault (by's Master sharply-myld) Blushing and bleaking, betwixt shame and fear, With down-cast eyes laden with many a tear, More with sad gesture, than with words, doth craue An humble Pardon of his Censor graue: So Dauid, hearing th'holy Prophets Threat, Dauids Repentance. He apprehends Gods Iudgements dradly-great; And (thrill'd with fear) flies for his sole defence To pearly Tears, Mournings, and sad Laments: Off-goes his Gold; his glory treads he down, His Sword, his Scepter, and his pretious Crown: He fasts, he prayes, he weeps, he grieues, he grones, His hainous Sins he bitterly bemones: And, in a Caue hard-by, he roareth out A sigh-full Song, so dolefully devout, That even the Stone doth groan, and pearç't withall, Lets it's salt tears with his sad tears to fall. Ay-gracious Lord (thus Sings he night and day) Wash wash, my Soule in thy deep Mercies sea: Psal. 51. O Mercy, Mercy Lord alowd he Cries; (And Mercy, Mercy, still the Rock replyes). O God, my God, sith for our grieuous Sin Application to France. (Which will-full we so long haue weltred in) Thou powr'st the Torrents of thy Vengeance down On th'azure Field with Goulden Lillies sow'n: Sith every moment thy iust Anger drad Roars, thunders, lightens on our guilty head: Sith Famine, Plague, and War (with bloody hand) Doo all at once make havock of this Land: Make vs make vse of all these Rods aright; That we may quench with our Tears-water quite Thin Ire-full Fire: our former Vices spurn; And, true-reform'd, Iustice to Mercy turn. And so, O Father, (fountain of all Good, The like to England, now for many yeares together grieuously afflicted with the Plague. Ocean of Iustice, Mercie's bound-less Flood) Since, for Our Sins exceeding all the rest, As most ingrate-full, though most rarely blest (After so long Long-Sufferance of Thine: So-many Warnings of thy Word diuine: So-many Threatnings of thy dread-full Hand: So-many Dangers scap't by Sea and Land: So-many Blessings in so good a King: So-many Blossoms of that fruit ful Spring: So-many Foes abroad; and False at home: So-many Rescues from the rage of Rome; So-many Shields against so many Shot: So-many Mercies in that Powder-Plot (So light regarded and so soon forgot). Since for Our Sins, so many and so great, So little mov'd with Promise or with Threat, Thou, now at last (as a iust ielouze God) Strik'st vs thy Self with thine immediate Rod, Thy Rod of Pestilence: whose rage-full smart, With deadly pangs pearcing the strongest heart, Tokens of Terror leaues vs where it lights: And so infects vs (or at least affrights) That Neighbour Neighbour, Brother Brother shuns; The tendrest Mother dares not see her Sons; The neerest Friend his deerest Friend doth flye; Yea, scarce the Wife dares close her Husbands eye. For, through th'Example of our Vicious life, Simile.As Sin breeds Sin; and Husband marr's the Wife, Sister proudes Sister, Brother hardens Brother, And one Companion doth corrupts another: So through Contagion of this dire Disease, It (iustly) doth thy heav'nly Iustice please, To cause vs thus each other to infect: Though This we fly, and That too nigh affect. Since for our Sins, which hang so fast vpon-vs, So dreadfully thy Fury frowneth on-vs; Sith still thou Strikest, and still Threat'nest more, More grieuous Wounds then we haue felt before: O gratious Father, giue vs grace (in fine) To make our Profit of these Rods of thine; That, true-Converted by thy milde Correction, We may abandon euery foul Affection: That Humblenes may flaring Pride dis-plume: That Temperance may Surfaiting consume: That Chastity may chase our wanton Lust: That Diligence may wear-off Slothfull rust: That Loue may liue, in Wrath and Enuies place: That Bounties hand may Auarice deface: That Truth may put Lying and Fraud to flight: That Faith and Zeal may keep thy Sabbaths right: That Reverence of thy drad Name may banish Blasphemous Oathes, and all Profaneness vanish. Since for our Sins (aswell in Court as Cottage) Of all Degrees, all Sexes, Youth and Dotage, Of Clarks and Clownes; Rich, Poore; and Great and Small, Thy fear-ful Vengeance, hangeth ouer all; O Touch vs all with Horror of our Crimes: O Teach vs all to turn to thee betimes: O Turn vs (Lord) and we shall turned be: Giue what thou bidst, and bid what pleaseth thee: Giue vs Repentance; that thou mayst repent Our present Plagve, and future Punishment. FINIS. The Magnificence. THE II. BOOK OF THE FOVRTH DAY OF the Second Week, of Bartas. The Argvment. Death-summon'd David, in his sacred throne Instals (instructs) his yong Son Salomon: His (pleas-God) Choice of Wisedom, wins him Honor: And Health and Wealth (at once) to wait vpon her: His wondrous Doom, quick Babe's Claim to decide: Mis-Matches taxt, in His with Pharaonide: Their pompous Nuptials: Seav'n Heav'n-Masquers there. The glorious Temple, Builded richly-rare. Salem's Renown drawes Saba to his Court: King Iames, to His, brings Barta's, in like fort. Happy are You (O You delicious Wits) That stint your Studies, as your Fury fits: That in long Labours (full of pleasing pain) Exhaust not wholly all your learned brain: That, changing Note, now light and grave canon, Handle the Theam that first you light vpon: That, heere in Sonnets, there in Epigrams, Euaporate your sweet Soule-boyling Flames. But my deer Honor, and my sacred Vows, And Heav'ns decree (made in that Higher-House) Hold mee fast fetter'd (like a Gally-slaue) To this hard Task. No other case I haue, Nought else I dream of; neither (night nor day) Aim at ought else, or look I other-way: But (alwayes busie) like a Mil-stone seem Still turned round with the same rapid stream. Thence is't that oft (maugre Apollos grace) I humme so harsh; and in my Works inchase Lame, crawling Lines, according to the Fire, Which (more or lesse) the whirling Poles inspire: And also mingle (Linsie-woolsie-wise) This gold-ground Tissue with too-mean supplies. You, all the year long, doo not spend your wing: But during only your delightfull Spring (Like Nightingales) from bush to bush you play, From Tune to Tune, from Myrtle spray to spray: But, I too-bold, and like the Swallow right, Not finding where to rest me, at one flight A bound-less ground-less Sea of Times I passe, With Auster now, anon with Boreas. Your quick Career is pleasant, short, and eath; At each Lands-end you sit you down and breathe On som green bank; or, to refresh you, finde Som Rosie-arbour, from the Sun and winde: But, end-less is my Course: for, now I glyde On Ice; then (dazled) head-long down I slyde: Now vp I climbe: then through the Woods I craul, I stray, I stumble, somtimes down I fall. And, as base Morter serveth to vnite Simile.Red, white, gray Marble, Iasper, Galactite: So, to connex my queint Discourse, somtimes I mix loose, limping, and ill-polisht Rimes. Yet will I not this Work of mine giue o're. The Labour's great; my Courage yet is more, My hart's not yet all voyd of sacred heat: Ther's nothing Glorious but is hard to get. Hils were not seen but for the Vales betwixt: The deep indentings artificiall mixt Amid Musäiks (for more ornament) Haue prizes, sizes, and dies different. And O! God grant, the greatest spot you spie In all my Frame, may be but as the Fly, Which on her Ruff (whiter than whitest snowes) To whiten white, the fairest Virgin sowes: (Or like the Veluet on her brow: or, like The dunker Mole on Venus dainty Cheeke: And, that a few faults may but lustre bring To my high furies where I sweetest sing. David waxt old and cold; and's vitall Lamp, Lacking it's oyl of Natiue moist, grew damp (But by degrees); when with a dying voice (But liuely vigor of Discretion choise) He thus instructs his yong Son Salomon, And (as Heav'n cals) instals him in his Throne. Whom, with-out Force, Vproar, or Ryualing, Dauids instructions to his Son Salomon. Nature, and Law, and Fortune make a King; Euen He (my Son) must be both Iust and Wise, If long he look to Rule and Royalize: But he, whom only, Fortunes Fauour rears Vnto a Kingdom, by som new-found stairs; He must appeare more than a man; and cast By rarest Worth to make his Crown sit fast. My Salomon, thou know'st thou art my Yongest: Thou know'st, besides, out of what Bed thou sprungest: Thou seest what loue all Izrael bears thy Brother: To honor Thee, what wrong I doo to other; Yea euen to Nature and our Natiue Law: 'Tis thy part therefore, in all points to draw To full Perfection; and with rare effect Of Noblest Vertues hide thy Births defect. Thou, Izraels King, serue the great King of All, A king (first of all) ought to be Religious. And only on his Conducts pedestall Found thine Affaires: vpon his Sacred Lore Thine eyes and minde be fixed euermore: The barking rage of bold Blasphemers hate: Thy Souerain's Manners (Vice-Roy) imitate. Nor think, the thicknes of thy Palace Wals, Thine iron Gates, and high gold-seeled Halls, Can let his Eye to spie (in euery part) The darkest Closets of thy Mazie Heart. If birth or Fate (my Son) had made thee Prince Of Idumeans or of Philistins, Valorous. If Pharaoh's Title had befall'n to thee, If the Medes Myter bowed at thy knee, Wert thou a Sophy; yet with Vertues luster Thou oughtst (at least) thy Greatnes to illuster. But, to Command the Seed of Abraham, The Holy Nation to Controule and tame, To bear a Iosuahs or a Samsons load, To be Gods Vice-Roy, needs a Demi-God. Before old Seruants giue not new the start Impartial in bestowing Preferments. (Kings-Art consists in Action more then Art.) Old Wine excelleth new: Nor (giddily) Will a good Husband grub a goodly Tree In his faire Orchards midst, whose fruitfull store Simile. Hath graç't his Table twenty yeers and more; To plant a Graft, yer e'r he taste the same, Saue with the teeth of a (perhaps) false Fame. These Parasites are euen the Pearls and Rings Impatient of Parasites and Flatterers. (Pearls, said I? Perils) in the eares of Kings: For O, what Mischief but their Wiles can work? Sith euen within vs (to their aid) doth lurk A smoother Soother, euen our owne Selfs-loue (A malady that nothing can remoue) Which, with these strangers, secretly Combin'd In League offensiue (to the firmest Minde) Perswades the Coward, he is Wisely-meek: The drunkard, Stout: the periure, Politick: The cruell Tyrant, a iust Prince they call; Sober, the Sot; the Lauish, Liberal: And, quick nos'd Beagles, senting right his lore (Trans-form'd into him) euen his Faults adore. To banish Atheists and all notoriously wicked persons fr? his presence.Fly then those Monsters: and giue no accesse To men infamous for their wickednesse: Endure no Atheist, brook no Sorcerer Within thy Court, nor Thief, nor Murderer: Lest the contagion of their banefull breath Poyson the publike fountain, and to death Infect Thy manners (more of force then Law) The spring, whence Subiects good or bad will draw. To over-Rule his owne Passions &amp; Affections.Rule thine Affects, thy fury and thy fear: Hee's no true King, who no self's-sway doth beare: Not what thou could'st, but what thou shouldst, effect: And to thy Lawes, first thine owne-self subiect. For, ay the Subiect will (fear set a-side) Through thick and thin, hauing his King for guide. To be milde and gratious.Shew thy Self gratious, affable and meek; And be not (proud) to those gay godlings like, But once a year from their gilt Boxes tane, To impetrate the Heav'ns long wisht-for raine. To be faithfull of his promise.To fail his Word, a King doth ill beseem: Who breaks his faith, no faith is held with him, Deceipt's deceiv'd: Iniustice meets vniust: Disloyall Prince armes subiects with distrust; And neighbour States will in their Leagues commend A Lion, rather then a Fox, for Friend. To be readier to Reward then Punish.Be prodigall of Vertues iust reward: Of punishments be sparing (with regard). Arm thou thy brest with rarest Fortitude; Things Eminent are euer most pursu'd: On highest Places, most disgraces threat: The roughest windes on widest gates do beat. Not to be Quærellous, yet quick &amp; courageous in a iust Cause.Toil not the World with Wars ambitious spite: But if thine Honour must maintain thy Right, Then shew thee David's Son; and wisely-bold Follow 't as hot, as thou beginst it cold: Watch, Work, Deuise, and with vn-weary limb, Wade thorough Foords, and ouer Chanels swim. His exercise in Warre.Let tufted Planes for pleasant shades suffice, In heat; in Cold, thy Fire be exercise: A Targe thy Table, and a Turf thy Bed: Let not thy Mouth be ouer-dainty fed: Let labour be thy sauce, thy Caske thy Cup; Whence for thy Nectar som ditch-water sup: Let Drums, and Trumpets, and shril Fifes and Flutes Serue thee for Citterns, Virginals and Lutes: Trot vp a Hill; Run a whole Field for Race; Leap a large Dike; Tosse a long Pike, a space: Perfume thy head with dust and sweat: appear Captain and Souldier. Souldiers are on fire, Having their King (before them Marching forth) Follow in fortune, witness of their Worth. I should inflame thy heart with learnings loue; Saue that I knowe what diuine habits mooue In peace not to be ouer studious: yet, to vnderstand the Principles of all Prince-fit Sciences. Thy profound Spirit: only, let th'ornament Of Letters wait on th'Art of Regiment: And take good heed, lest as excesse of humor In Plants, becomes their Flowring Lifes consumer; So too-much Study, and delight in Arts, Quench the quick vigour of thy Spirituall parts, Make thee too-pensiue, over-dull thy Senses, And draw thy Minde from Publike cares of Princes. With a swift-winged soule, the Course survay Of Nights dim Taper and the Torch of Day: Sound round the Cels of th'Ocean dradly-deep: Measure the Mountains snowie tops and steep: Ferret all Corners of this neather Ball; But to admire the Makers Art in all, His Power and Prudence: and, resemble not Som simple Courtier, or the silly Sot That in the base-Court all his time hath spent, Simile. In gazing on the goodly Battlement, The chamfred Pillers, Plinths, and antique Bosses, Medals, Ascents, Statues, and strange Colosses; Amaz'd and musing vpon every piece Of th'vniforme, fair stately Frontispice; Too-too-self-rapt (through too-self-humoring) Losing himselfe, while others finde the King. Holde-even the balance, with clean hands, clos'd eyes: Revenge seuerely Publike Iniuries; The principal &amp; peculiar office of a king. Remit thine Owne. Heare the Cries, see the Tears Of all distressed poor Petitioners. Sit (oft) thy selfe in Open Audience: Who would not be a Iudge, should be no Prince. For, Iustice Scepter and the Martiall Sword Ought never seuer, by the Sacred Word. Spare not the Great; neither despise the Small: Let not thy Lawes be like the Spiders Caul, Simile. Where little Flyes are caught and kild; but great Passe at their pleasure, and pull-down the Net. Away with Shepheards that their Flocks deface: Chuse Magistrates that may adorn their Place; Such as feare God, such as will Iudge vprightly: Men by the seruants iudge the Master lightly. Giue to the vertuous; but thy Crown-demain Diminish not: giue still to giue again: For there too-deep to dip, is Prodigalitie; And to dry-vp the Springs of Liberalitie. Hic labor, hoc Opus.But aboue all (for Gods sake) Son, beware, Be not intrapt in Womens wylie snare. I feare, alas (good Lord, supreamly sage, Avert from Mine th'effect of this Præsage) Alas! I feare that this sweet Poyson will My House here-after with all Idols fill. But, if that neither Vertue's sacred loue, Nor fear of Shame thy wanton Minde can moue To watch in Arms against the Charms of Those; At least, be warned by thy Fathers Woes. Fare-well my Son: th'Almightie cals me hence: I passe, by Death, to Lifes most excellence: And, to go Raign in Heav'n (from World-cares free) The Crown of Israel I resigne to thee. O thou that often (for a Princes Sin) Transport'st the Scepter, even from Kin to Kin, From Land to Land; Let it remaine with Mine: And, of my Sons Sons (in successiue Ligne) Let that All-Powerfull deer-drad Prince descend, Whose glorious Kingdom never shall haue end; Whose iron Rod shall Satans Rule vn-doo: Whom Iacob trusts in; Whom I thirst for too. Initium Regni Salomon. DAVID deceast: His Son (him tracking right) With heart and voyce worships the God of Might; Enters his Kingdom by the Gate of Pietie; Makes Hymns and Psalms in Laud of the true Deitie; Offers in Gabeon; where, in Spirit he sees His vision.(While his Sense sleeps) the God of Maiesties, The Lord of Hoasts; who, Crownd with radiant flames, Offers him choice of these foure louely Dames. First, Glory, shaking in her hand a Pike Description of Glory.(Not Maid-like Marching, but braue Souldier-like) Among the Stars her stately head she beares, A silver Trumpet shril a-slope she weares, Whose Winde is Praise, and whose Stentorian sound Doth far and wide o'r all the world redound. Her wide-side Robes of Tissue passing price, All Story-wrought with bloody Victories, Triumphs and Tropheis, Arches, Crowns and Rings; And, at her feet, there sigh a thousand Kings. Not far from her, coms Wealth, all rich-bedight Of Riches. In Rhea's, Thetis, Pluto's Treasures bright: The glittering stuff which doth about her fold Is rough with Rubies, stiff with beaten Gold. With either hand from hollow steanes she powrs Pactolian surges and Argolian showrs. Fortune, and Thrift, and Wakefulnes and Care, And Diligence, her daily Servants are. Then cheerfull Health: whose brow no wrinkle bears, Of Health. Whose cheek no palenesse, in whose eye no tears; But like a childe, she's pleasant, quick, and plump, Shee seems to fly, to skip to daunce, and iump: And Life's bright Brand in her white hand doth shine: Th'Arabian birds rare plumage (platted fine) Serues her for Sur-coat: and her seemly train, Mirth, Exercise and Temperance sustain. Last, Wisdome coms, with sober countenance: Wisdom. To th'ever-Bowrs her oft a-loft t'advance, The light Mamuques wing-less wings she has: Her gesture cool, as comly-graue her pase: Where e'r she go, she never goes with-out Compasse and Rule, Measure and waights about: And by her side (at a rich Belt of hers) The Glasse of Nature and her-Selfe she wears. Having beheld their Bewties bright, the Prince Seems rapt all-ready even to Heaven from hence; Sees a whole Eden round about him shine: And, 'mid so many Benefits Diuine, Doubts which to chuse. At length he thus begun: O Lord (saith he, what hath thy Servant don, That so great blessings I should take or touch, Or thou shouldst daign to honour me so much? Thou doost prevent my Merit; or (deer Father) Delight'st to Conquer even my Malice rather. Fair Victorie's a noble Gift: and nought Is more desired, or is sweeter thought, Than even to quench our Furie's thirst with blood, In iust Revenge on those that wrong our Good: But oft (alas) foul Insolence comes after; And, the long Custom of inhumane Slaughter, Transformes in time the myldest Conquerors To Tigers, Panthers, Lions, Bears, and Boars. Happy seems He, whose count-less Heards for Pasture Dis-roab (alone) mount Carmels moatly Vesture: For whom alone a whole rich Countrey, torn With timely Tools, brings forth both Wine and Corn: That hath soft Sereans yellow Spoyls, the Gems And precious stones of the Arabian streams, The Mines of Ophir, th'Entidorian Fruits, The Saban Odours, and the Tyrian Sutes. But yet we see, where Plenty chiefly swayes, There Pride increases, Industry decayes: Rich-men adore their Gold: whoso aspires To lift lo Heav'n his sight and Soules Desires, He must be Poor (at least-wise like the Poor) Riches and Fear are fellows ever-more. I would liue long, and I would gladly see My Nephews Nephews, and their Progenie: But the long Cares I fear, and Cumbers rife, Which commonly accompany Long-Life. Who well liues, long liues: for this Age of ours Should not be numbred by years, dayes and howrs: But by our brave Exployts: and this Mortality Is not a moment, to that Immortality. But, in respect of Lady Wisdomes grace (Even at their best) the rest are all but base. Salomons choice. Honour is but a puffe; Life but a vapour; Wealth but a wish; Health but a sconce of paper: A glistring Scepter but a Maple twig; Gold, Drosse; Pearls, Dust, how-ever bright and big. Shee's Gods owne Mirror, shee's a Light, whose glance Springs from the Lightning of his Countenance: Shee's mildest Heav'ns most sacred influence: Never decays her Beauties excellence; Aye like her-Self: and shee doth alwaies trace Not only the same path, but the same pase. Without her, Honour, Health, and Wealth would proue Three Poysons to me. Wisdom (from aboue) Is th'only Moderatrix, spring, and guide, Organ and honour of all Gifts beside. Her, her I like, her only (Lord I craue, Her Company for-ever let me haue: Let me for-ever from her sacred lip, Th'Ambrosiall Nard, and rosiall Nectar sip: In every Cause, let me consult with her: And, when I Iudge, be shee my Counsailer. Let, with her staffe, my yet-Youth govern well In Pastures fair the Flock of Izrael, A compt-less Flock, a Flock so great (indeed) As of a Shepheard sent from Heav'n had need. Lord, giue her mee: alas! I pine, I die; Or if I liue, I liue her Pyrausta. Flame-bred-Flie: And (new Farfalla) in her radiant shine, Too-bold, I burn these tender wings of mine. Hold, take her to thee, said the Lord: and sith No Beauty else thy soule enamoreth; For ready hand-maids to attend vpon her, I'l giue thee also Health, and Wealth, and Honor; (For 't is not meer, so High-descended Queen, So great a Lady, should alone be seen) The rather, that my Bounty may invite Thee, serving Her, to serue Me day and night. King Salomon, awaked, plainely knew That this divine strange Vision never grew From the sweet Temper of his sound Complexion; But that it was som Peece of more Perfection, Some sacred Picture admirably draw'n With Heav'nly pencill, by an Angels hand. For (happy) He had (without Art) the Arts, And Learning (without learning) in all parts: A more then humane Knowledge beautifies His princely actions: vp to Heav'n he flies, He dyues to Hell, hee sounds the Deep, he enters To th'inmost Cels of the Worlds lowest Centers. The secret Riddles of the sacred Writ His excellent Wisdom and vnderstanding in all things. Are plain to him: and his deep-pearcing Wit, Vpon few Words of the Heav'n-prompted stile, In a few Dayes, large Volumes can compile. He (learned) sees the Sun's Eclipse, sans terror: He knowes the Planets never erring Error; And, whether Nature, or some Angel moue Their Sphears, at once with triple Dance aboue: Whether the Sun self-shine; his Sister, not: Whether, Spring, Winter, Autumn, Summer hot, Be the Suns Sons: what kinde of mounting vapor Kindles the Comet, and the long-taild Taper: What boystrous Lungs the roaring Whirlers blow'n: What burning Wings the Lightning rides vpon: What Curb the Ocean in his bounds doth keep: What power Night's Princesse powrs vpon the Deep: Whether the Heav'ns sweet-sweating Kisse appear To be Pearls parent, and the Oyster's Pheer; And whether, dusk, it makes them dim withall; Cleer, breeds the cleer; and stormy brings the pale. Whether, from Sea the Amber-greece be sent; Or be som Fishes pleasant excrement. He knowes, why th'Earth's immoueable and round, The lees of Nature, Center of the Mound: He knowes her measure. And he knowes beside, How Coloquintida (duely apply'd) With-in the darkness of the Conduit-Pipes, Amid the winding of our in-ward Tripes, Can so discreetly the White humour take; Rheubarb, the Yellow; Hellebore, the Black: And, whether That in our weak Bulks be wrought, By drawing 't to them; or by driving 't out. In brief, from th'Hysop to the Cedar-Tree, He knowes the Vertues of all Plants that be. He knowes the Reason why the Woolfs fell tooth Giues a Horse swiftness; and his footing, floth: Why the Sex-changing, fierce Hyena's eye Puts curstest Curs to silence suddenly: Why th'irefull Elephant becommeth tame At the approaching of the fleecy Lamb: Why th'eye-bold Eagle never fears the flash Or force of Lightning, nor the Thunder-clash: Why the wilde Fen-Goose (which keeps warm her egs With her broad feet vnder her heatfull legs, And, tongue-less, cries) as wing-lym'd, cannot flie, Except she (glad) Seas brynie glasse descrie. He knoweth also, whether that our stone Be caked Earth, or Exhalation: Whether the Metalls (that we daily see) Be made of Sulphur and of Mercurie; Or, of som Liquour by long Cold condenst, And by the Heat well purified and cleans'd; Or, of a certain sharp and cindrous humor; Or whether He that made the Waving Tumor; The motly Earth; and th'Heav'nly Sphears refin'd, All-mighty, made them such as now we finde. He comprehends from whence it is proceeding, That spotted Iasper-stones can staunch our bleeding: Saphires, cure eyes, the Topaz to resist The rage of Lust; of drinke the Amethist: And also, why the clearest Diamant (Iealous) impugns the thefts of th'Adamant. Tunes, Measures, Numbers, and Proportions Of Bodies with their Shadows, als' he kons; And (fild with Nectar-Deaws, which Heau'n drips) The Bees haue made Hony within his lips. But he imbraceth much more earnestly The gain-full Practice, than cold Theory: Nor reaks he so of a Sophistick pride Of prattling Knowledge (too-self-magnifi'd) As of that goodly Art to govern well The sacred Helms of Church and Common-weal, And happily to entertain in either, A harmony of Great and Small together. Especially Hee's a good Iusticer, And to the Lawes dooth Life and strength confer. And, as the highest of Bigaurian Hils Simile. Ay bears his head vp-right, and never yeelds To either side, scorns Winde and Rain and Snowe, Abides all weathers, with a cheerfull brow; Laughs at a Storme, and brauely tramples vnder His steddy Knees, the prowd, lowd, rowling Thunder: So hee's a Iudge inflexibly-vpright. No Loue, nor Hatred, of the Guilty wight (What e'r he wear for Calling, small or great) His Venging blade can either blunt or whet; He spurneth Fauours, and he scorneth Fears, And vnder foot he treadeth private Tears: Gold's radiant Lustre never blears his Eye: Nor is he led through Ignorance a-wry. His voyce is held an Oracle of all: The soule of Lawes hee wisely can exhale: In doubtfull Cases he can subtilize, And wyliest pleaders hearts anatomize. Scarce fifteen times had Ceres (since his Birth) With her gilt Tresses glorifi'd the Earth; When he decides, by happy Wisdoms means, The famous quarrell of two crafty Queans. Is't possible, O Earth (thus cries the first) The Controuersie between the 2. Harlots for the liue Childe. But that (alas) thou should'st for anger burst, And swallow quick this execrable Quean! Is't possible (O gracious Soverain) That comming new from dooing such a deed So horrible, she shame-less dares proceed T'approch thy sight, thy sacred Throne t'abuse, Not begging pardon, but even bent t'accuse? Last night, with surfet and with sleep sur-cloyd, This care-less step-dam her owne Childe o'r-layd: And softly then (finding it cold and dead) Layes it by me, and takes mine in the stead. Heer, old, bold strumpet, take thy bastard brat, Hence with thy Carion, and restore me that, Restore me mine, my louely living Boy, My hope, my hap, my Loue, my Life, my Ioy. O cruell Chance! O sacrilegious! Shall thy foul lips my little Angel busse? At thy fond prattling, shall hee pret'ly smile? And tug, and touze thy greasie locks the-while? And all his Child-hood fill thy soule with glee? And, grow'n a man, sustaine thine age and thee? While wretched I haue only, for my share, His Births hard Travail, and my burthen's Care, His rest-less rocking, wyping, washing, wringing; And to appease his way ward Cries with singing? O most vnhappy of all Woman-kinde! O Child-less mother! O! why is my Minde More passion-stirred, than my hand is strong? But, rather than I'l pocket vp this wrong; To be reveng'd, I'l venter two for one, I'l haue thy Life, although it cost mine owne. O filthy Bitch! Vile Witch (sayes th'other tho) O! who would think, that Wine could mad one so? O impudent! though God thou fear'st not, fear The Kings cleer iudgement, who Gods place doth bear. Art not content t'haue call'd (or rather cry'd) Me Whore, and Thief, Drunkard and Paricide: But thou wilt also haue my Childe, my deer (Whom with so strong a knot Loue links so neer) My Babe, my Blisse? Yea marry (Minks) and shall: Who takes my Childe, shall take my life with-all. Iust Davids iust Son; for thy Father's sake, For his deer loue, for all that he did make Of thee a Childe, when he (re-childing) sought With childish sport to still thy cryes, and taught (Or'gan to teach) with language soft and weak, Thy tender tongue som easie tearme to speak: Or, when (all bloody, breath-less, hot he came Laden with spoyls of Kings he overcame, He ran t'imbrace thee, rockt thee in his Targe, And when thou cry'dst, vpon his shoulder large Did set thee vp, while thou his beard didst tug, Play'dst with his nose, about his neck didst hug, Gap'tst on his glittering Helm, and smil'dst to see Another Salomon there smile on thee: And vnderneath his dancing Plume didst play Like Bird in bush; sporting from spray to spray; I doe adiure thee to attend my Plea: By the sweet name of thy deer Bersabe, Who in the night, shivering for cold, so oft Hath bow'd her selfe over thy Cradle soft; Who both the bottles of her Nectar white Hath spent vpon thee, hundred times a night; Who on thy head hath set her pearly Crown, And in Thy life liv'd more than in her Owne: I doo adiure thee (O great King) by all That in the World we sacred count or call, To doe me Right: and if, too-mylde, alas, Too mercifull thou wilt not Sentence passe Of iust revenge for my receiued wrong; Yet, reaue me not what doth to me belong, What liberall Nature hath bestow'd on me, What I am feis'd-of (without thank to thee); For pittie doo not my heart blood depriue, Make me not Childless, having Childe a-liue. While both, at once, thus to the King they Crie, 'Tis mine, 'Tis mine: thou ly'st; and thou doost lie: The partiall People divers Verdict spend; Some favour th'one, others the other friend: As, when two Gamesters hazard (in a trice) Fields, Vine-yards, Castles, on the Chance of Dice, Simile. The standers-by, diversly stird with-in, Wish, some that This, and some that That may win: Waver twixt Hope and Fear: and every-one's Moov'd, with the mooving of the guilefull Bones. Only, the King demurrs: his prudent ears Finde like, both reasons, both complaints, both tears: The Infants face could not discipher whether Of both should be the very Mother: neither Could calculation of their ages, cleer The Iudges doubt, nor any proof appear. Then, thus He waighs (but as in dreaming wise); Th'industrious Iudge, when all proofs fail him, flies Vnto Coniectures drawn (the probablest; Out of the book of Nature's learned brest; Or to the Rack: Now, Mothers loue (thinks hee) Is Natures owne vnchangeable Decree: And there's no Torture that exceeds the pains Which a kinde Mother in her Childe sustains. Then (as awake) Come, come, no more a-doo, The Doubt admirably decided. Dispatch (saith hee) Cleaue the quick Childe in two, Look that the Sword be sharp; in such a case, Needs must our Pittie giue our Iustice place: Iustice (yee see) can iudge him whole to neither: Divide him therefore, and giue half to either. O difficult! but thus the King descries Their hearts deep secrets: all discovered lyes, The vizor's off; their Tongues, sincerely prest With true instinct, their very Thoughts exprest: Bee't (said the stepdam) so, sith 't must be so: Diuide him iustly from the top to toe. No (said the other) rather, I renounce My right in him, take thou him all at once, Enioy him all; I'l rather haue him Thine A-liue, and whole, than dead and mangled Mine. Thine (quoth the King) hee's Thine by Birth (I see) Thine by thy Loue, and thine by my Decree. Now, as with Gold growes in the self-same Mine Simile. Much Chrysocolle, and also Silver fine: The wonderfull Prosperitie of Salomon and his People. So supream Honor, and Wealth (matcht by none) Second the Wisdom of great Salomon. He far and neer commands by Land and Seas; A hundred Crowns doo homage vnto His: His neerest Bounds, Nile's Sea and Sidon seem, And Euphrates bows his moyst horns to him: Peru, they say (supposing Ophir so) By yeerly Fleets into his Fisk doth flowe: In Sion Gold's as common as the Sand; As Pebles, Pearls: Through-out all Iury-Land, There seems an Ocean of all happinesse To over-flowe; and all doo all possesse: Each vnder his owne Vine and his owne Tree, His Grapes and Figs may gather quietly. Thus he abounds in Blisse; not so to change-ill Man into Beast, but make of Man an Angel, To praise th'Immortall, who to him hath given Even heer a Taste of the delights of Heaven. This great, wise, wealthy, and well-spoken King His sweet renown o'r all the World doth ring: The Tyrian, for Confederate desires him: Pharao for Son: th'Alien no lesse admires-him: Than his owne Subiect: and his eyes sweet flames, As far as Nilus, fire the flower of Dames. Mis-Matches iustly taxed.O Salomon, see'st thou not (O mis-hap!) This Mariage is no Mariage, but a Trap? That such a mongrell Match of differing Creed, Of mortall quarels is th'immortall seed? That Ox and Asse can never well be broak To drawe one Plough together in one yoak? Who-ever weds a Miscreant, forth-with Divorceth God: our Faith still wavereth; It needs an Aide and not a Tempter nigh, Not th'instrument of th'old Deceiver slie, Not deadly poyson in our Coach to couch, Sleep in our bosome, and our breast to touch, And breathe into vs (in a kinde of kissing) An Ir-religion, of the Serpents hissing. Shee that from Ægypt coms (O King) is none Flesh of thy Flesh, nor yet Bone of thy Bone: But a strange Bone, a barbarous Rib, a Peece Impoysoned all with Memphian Leprosies. But, thou wilt say, thy Loue hath stript yer-while Her spotted suite of Idol-serving Nile: And clad her all, in Innocence, in white; Becom'n by Faith a true-born Abramite. It might be so: and to that side I take, The rather, for that sacred Beauties sake, Where-of she is a figure. Yet, I fear Her Train will stain thy Kingdom every-where, Corupt thy Court: and God will be offended To haue his People with strange People blended; The mighty Lord, who hath precisely said, You shall not theirs, nor they your daughters wed. Vnder the gentle Equinoctiall Line, A pleasant Description of Loue's fruitfull Groue. Faire amorous Nature waters freshly-fine A little Groue clad in eternall green, Where all the yeer long lusty May is seen, Suiting the Lawns in all her pomp and pride Of liuely Colours, louely varified: There smiles the ground, the starry-Flowers each one There mount the more, the more th'are trod vpon: There all growes toyl-less; or, if tild it were, Sweet Zephyrus is th'onely Husband there. There Auster never roars, nor Hail dis-leaues Th'immortall Groue, nor any branch bereaues. There the straight Palm-Tree stoopeth in the Calm To kiss his Spouse, his loyall Female Palm: There with soft whispers whistling all the yeer The broad-leav'd Plane-Tree Courts the Plane his Pheer, The Poplar wooes the Poplar, and the Vine About the Elme her slender armes doth twine: Th'Ivie about the Oak: there all doth proue, That there all springs, all growes, all liues in Loue. Opinion's Porter, and the Gate she bars Gainst Couetize, cold Age, and sullen Cares, Except they leaue-off and lay-down before Their troublous load of Reason at the doore; But opens wide, to let-in Bashful-Boldness, Dumb-speaking Signes, Chill-Heat, and Kindled-Coldness, Smooth soothing Vowes, deep sorrows soon appeas'd, Tears sudden dry'd, fell Angers quickly pleas'd, Smiles, Wylie-Guiles, queint witty-pretty Toyes, Soft Idleness, and ground-less bound-less Ioyes, Sweet Pleasure plunged over head and ears In sugred Nectar, immateriall Fears, Hoarse Waaks, late Walks, Pain-pleasing kindly cruell, Aspiring Hope (Desire's immortall fuell) Licentious Loosness, Prodigall Expence Inchanting Songs, deep Sighs, and sweet Laments. These frolike Louelings fraighted Nests doe make The balmy Trees o'r-laden Boughs to crack; Bewty layes, Fancy sits, th'inflamed heat Of Loue doth hatch their Couvies nicely-neat: Som are but kindled yet, som quick appear, Som on their backs carry their Cradles deer, Som downy-clad, som (fledger) take a twig To pearch-vpon, som hop, from sprig to sprig: One, in the fresh shade of an Apple-Tree Lets hang its Quiver, while soft-pantingly 'T exhales hot Vapour: one, against a Sparrow Tries his stiff Bowe and Giant-stooping Arrow: Another sly sets lime-twigs for the Wren, Finch, Linot, Tit-mouse, Wag-Tail (Cock and Hen): See, see how some their idle wings forsake, And (turn'd, of Flyers, Riders) one doth take A Thrush, another on a Parrat rides, This mounts a Peacock, that a Swan bestrides, That manageth a phaisant: this doth make The Ring-Doue turn: that brings the Culver back: See how a number of this wanton Fry Doo fondly chase the the gawdie Butter-fly, Some with their flowrrie Hat, some with their hands Some with sweet Rose-boughs, some with Myrtle wands: But, th'horned Bird, with nimble turns, beguiles And scapes the snares of all these Loues a-whiles. Leaue Wags (Cries Venus) leaue this wanton Play: For so, in steed of Butter-Flyes, you may, You may (my Chicks) a Childe of Venus strike: For, some of mine haue Horns and all alike. This said: eftsoons two twins whose gold-head darts Are never steeped but in Royall hearts; Come, Brother deer (said either) come let's to 't, Let's each a shaft at yon two bosoms shoot. Their winged words th'effect ensues as wight, Two or three steps they make to take their flight, And quick-thick shaking on their sinnewie side Their long strong sarcels, richly triple-died Gold-Azure-Crimsin; th'one aloft doth soar To Palestine, th'other to Nilus shoare. Pharonida. Pharo's faire daughter (wonder of her Time) Then in the blooming of her beauties Prime, Was queintly dressing of her Tress-full head Which round about her to the ground did spread: And, in a rich gold-seeled Cabinet, Three Noble Mayds attend her in the feat. One with a peece of double dented Box Combs out at length her goodly golden locks: Another 'noynts them with Perfumes of price: Th'other with bodkin or with fingers nice, Frizzles and Furls in Curls and Rings a part; The rest, loose dangling without seeming Art, Waue to and froe, with cunning negligence Gracing the more her Beauties excellence: When, armd with Arrows burning, brightly keen, Swift Swallow-like, one of these Twins comes in; And, with his left wing hiding still his Bowe, Into her bosom shot, I wot not how. My side! my heart (the Royall Maid cries out) Loves first Feaver. O! I am slaine: But, searching all about, When shee perceiu'd no blood, nor bruise; alas, It is no wound; but, sleeping on the grasse, Some snake (saith shee) hath crept into me quick, It gnawes my heart: ah, help me, I am sick, Haue mee to bed: eigh me, a friezing-frying, A burning cold torments me living-dying. O cruell Boy, alas, how mickle gall Thy baenfull shaft mingles thy Mell withall! The Royall Maid, which with her Mates was wont Smile, skip and dance on Fields inammeld front, Loves solenesse, sadnes, and Self-privacy; Sighes, sobs and throbs, and yet she knowes not why: The sumptuous pride of massie Piramides Presents her eyes with Towrs of Iebusides; In Niles cleer Crystall shee doth Iordan see; In Memphis, Salem; and vn-warily Her hand (vnbidden) in her Sampler sets The King of Iuda's Name and Counterfets: Who, medi'ting the Sacred Temple's Plot, By th'other Twin at the same time is shot: The shaft sticks fast, the wound's within his veins: Sleep cannot bring a-sleep his pleasing pains; Pharonida's his heart, Pharonida Is all his Theam to talk-of, night and day: With-in his soule a civill War hee feeds: Th'all-seeing Sun now early backs his Steeds, Now mounts his Mid-day, and then setteth soon: But still his Loue stands at the hot high Noon. He Rides not his braue Coursers (as hee wont) Nor Reads, nor Writes, nor in his Throne doth mount To hear the Widow's Cause; neglects his Court, Neglects his Rule; Love rules him in such sort. You prudent Legats, Agents for this Marriage, Of Rings and Tablets you may spare the Carriage: For, witty Loue hath with his lovely shaft In eithers heart grav'n others lively Draught: Each Liues in other, and they haue (O strange!) Made of their burning hearts a happy Change. Better abroad, then home, their hearts delight; Yet long their bodies to their hoasts t'vnite. Which soon ensues: the Virgin's shortly had From Mothers armes imbracing gladly-sad: And th'aged Father, weeping as hee spake, Bids thus Adieu when shee her leaue doth take; Sweet Daughter dear, Osiris bee thy guide, And loving Isis blesse thee and thy Bride With golden Fruit; and daily without cease Your mutuall Loves may as your yeers increase. Wives, Maids and Children, yong and ould, each-where, With looks and vows from Turrets follow her: Calm Nilus calmer then it wont is grow'n, Her Ships haue merry windes, the Seas haue none: Her footing makes the ground all fragrant-fresh: Her sight re-flowres th'Arabian Wildernes: Iury reioyces, and in all the way Nothing but Trumpets, Fifes and Timbrels play: The Flowr-crown'd People, swarming on the Green, Cry still, God save, God save, God save the Queen; May shee bee like a scion, pale and sick Through th'over-shading of a Sire too thick: Which being Transplanted, free, sweet air doth sup, To th'sweating Clouds her grovy top sends vp, And prospers so in the strange soil, that (tild) Her golden Apples all the Orchard gild. No streets are seen in rich Iervsalem: For, vnder-foot fine scarlet paveth them, Silks hang the sides, and over-head they hold Archt Canapies of glistring Cloth of gold. They throng, they thrust, an ebbing-flowing Tide A Sea of Folk follows th'adored Bride: The ioyfull Ladies from their windows shed Sweet showrs of flowrs vpon her radiant head; Yet ielous, lest (dy'd in their native grain) Her Rosie Cheeks should Natur's Roses stain. But lo, at last, th'honor of Maiesty, Glory of Kings, King Salomon draws ny: Lo, now both Lovers enter-glauncing sweet (Like Sun and Moon, when at full view they meet In the mid-month) with amorous raies reflexion Send mutuall Welcoms from their deep affection: Both a-like yong, like beautifull, like brave, Both graç't a-like; so like, that whoso have Not neer observ'd their heads vnlikenesses, Think them two Adons, or two Venusses. These nouice Lovers at their first arrive Are bashfull both; their passions strangely strive: The soules sweet Fire his ruby flames doth flush Into their Faces in a modest blush: Their tongues are ty'd, their star-bright eyes seem vail'd With shame-faç't Cipres; all their senses fail'd. But, pompous Hymen, whither am I brought? Am not I (heathen) vnder th'happy Vault Where all the gods, with glorious mirth enhanç't, At Thetis Nuptials ate, and drank, and danç't? Heer, th'Idumeans mighty Ioue treads, vnder Salomons Nuptials. His tripping feet, his bright-light burning Thunder. A-while hee laies his Maiesty aside, To Court, and sport, and revell with his Bride; King, plaies the Courtier; Soverain, Suter 'coms; And seems but equal with his Chamber-Grooms: But yet, what e'r hee doo, or can devise, Disguised Glory shineth in his eies. Heer, many a Phœbus, and heer many a Muse On Heav'nly Layes so rarely-sweet doo vse Their golden bowes, that with the rapting sound Th'Arches and Columns wel-nigh dance the Round. Heer, many a Iuno, many a Pallas heer, Heer, many a Venus, and Diana cleer Catch many a gallant Lord, according as Wealth, Beauty, Honour, their affection drawes. Heer, many a Hebé fair, heer more then one Quick-serving Chiron neatly waits vpon The Beds and Boords, and pliant bears about The boawls of Nectar quickly turned out; And th'over-burdned Tables bend with waight Of their Ambrosiall over-filled fraight. Heer, many a Mars vn-bloody Combats fights, Heer, many a Hermes findes out new delights, Heer, many a horned Satyr, many a Pan, Heer, Wood-Nymphs, Flood-Nymphs, many a Faiery Fawn With lusty frisks and lively bounds bring-in Th'Antike, Morisko, and the Mattachine: For, even God's Servants (God knowes how) have supt The sugred baen of Pagan Rites corrupt. But, with so many lively Types, at will His rich rare Arras shall som other fill: Of all the sports, I'll onely chuse one Measure, One stately Mask compos'd of sage-sweet pleasure; A Dance so chaste, so sacred, and so grave (And yet so gracefull, and so lofty-brave) As may beseem (except I mee abuse) Great Salomon, and my celestiall Muse. The Tables voided of their various Cates, They rise at once; and, suiting their Estates, Each takes a Dame, and then to Dance they com Into a stately, rich, round-arched Room, So large and lightsom, that it (right) they call The Vniversall, or the Worlds great Hall. O what delight, to see so rich a showe Of Lords and Ladies dancing in a rowe All in a Round, reaching so far and wide O'r all the Hall to foot-it side by side! Their eyes sweet splendor seems a Pharos bright, With clinquant Raies their Body's clothed light: 'Tis not a Dance, but rather a smooth sliding, All moove alike, after the Musicks guiding: Their Tune-skill'd feet in so true Time doo fall, That one would swear one Spirit doth bear them all: They poste vn-mooving; and, though swift they passe, 'Tis not perceiv'd: of hundred thousand pase, One single back they: Round on Round they dance: And, as they traverse, cast a fruitfull glance. The Mask of Planets.Iust in the middle of the Hall, a-sloap (Even from the floor vnto the very top) A broad rich Baldrick there extendeth round, In-laid with gold vpon an azure ground; Where (cover'd all with Flames) in wondrous art Five Lords, two Ladies dance; but each a-part. Saturn.Heer trips an old-man in a Mantle dy'd Deep Leaden-hue, and round about him ty'd With a Snake-girdle biting off her tail. Within his Robes stuff (in a winding trail) Creeps Mandrake, Comin, Rue and Hellebore; With lively figures of the Bear and Boar, Camell, and Asse (about to bray well-ny): There the Strimonian Fowl seems even to cry; The Peacock, even to prank. For Tablet fine, About his neck hangs a great Cornaline, Where som rate Artist (curiousing vpon 't) Hath deeply cut Times triple-formed Front: His pase is heavy, and his face severe; His Body heer; but yet his Minde else-where. Iupiter.There the Lord Zedec him more spritely bears, Milde, fair and pleasant; on his back hee wears Tin-colour'd Tissue, figur'd all with Oaks, Ears, Violets, Lillies, Olives, Apricocks; Bordred with Phaisants, Eagles winged-black, And Elephants with Turrets on their back; Pointed with Diamonds, powdred and imbost With Emeralds, perfum'd with wondrous Cost. Mars.The third leads quicker on the self same Arch His Pyrrhik Galiard, like a star-like March: His face is fiery: Many an Amethist, And many a Iasper of the perfectest Doth brightly glister in the double gilt Of the rich Pommell and the pretious Hilt Of his huge Fauchin, bow'd from hand to heel: His boistrous body shines in burnisht Steel: His Shield flames bright with gold, imbossed hie With Wolves and Horse seem-running swiftly by, And freng'd about with sprigs of Scammony, And of Euphorbium forged cunningly. But, O fair Faëry, who art thou, whose eyes Venus. Inflame the Seas, the Air, the Earth, and Skies? Tell vs, what art thou, O thou fairest Fair, That trimm'st the Trammels of thy golden hair With Myrtle, Thyme and Roses; and thy Brest Gird'st with a rich and odoriferous A Spouse-belt. Cest, Where all the wanton brood of sweetest Loves Doo nestle close; on whom the Turtle-Doves, Pigeons, and Sparrowes day and night attend, Cooing and wooing wheresoe'r thou wend: Whose Robe's imbrodered with Pomgranat boughs, Button'd with Saphires, edg'd with Beryl rowes: Whose capering foot, about the starry floor, The Dance-guide Prince now follows, now's before? Art thou not Shee, that with a chaste-sweet flame Didst both our Brides hearts into one heart frame? And, was not Hee, that with so curious steps, Mercury. Next after thee, so nimbly turns and leaps, Say, was not Hee the witty Messenger, Their eloquent and quick Interpreter? How strange a suit! His meddly Mantle seems Scarlet, Wave-laced with Quick-silver streams; And th'end of every Lace, for tuft hath on A pretious Porphyre, or an Agate stone: A Cry of Hounds have heer a Deer in Chase: There a false Fox, heer a swift Kid they trace: There Larks and Linots, and sweet Nightingals (Fain'd vpon fained Trees) with wings and tails Loose hanging seem to swell their little throats, And with their warblings, shame the Cornets notes. Light Fumitory, Parsly, Burnets blade, And winding leaf his crispy Locks beshade: Hee's light and lively, all in Turns and Tricks; In his great Round, hee many small doth mix: His giddy course seems wandring in disorder; And yet there's found, in this disorder, order. Avoid base Vulgar, back Profane, stand-by; These sacred Revels are not for your ey: Com, gentle Gentles, Noble Spirits, draw neer, Preace through the Preace, com take your places heer, To see at full the Bride-groom and the Bride, A lovely Pair, exactly bewtifi'd With rare perfections, passing all the rest, Sole-happy Causes of this sumptuous Feast. Lo where they com: O what a splendor bright! Mine eyes doo dazle. O thou primer Light! Sun of the Sun, thy Raies keen point rebate, Thy dread-spread Fire a little temperate: O, dart (direct) on thy fair Spouse a-space Thine eyes pure light, the lustre of thy Face: For, I no longer can endure it, I Am burnt to ashes: O, I faint, I dy. But, blessed Couple, sith (alas) I may-not Behould you both vnmasked (nay, I can-not) Yet in these Verses let mee tell (I pray) Your Dance, your Courting, and your rich Array. Luna.The Queen's adorn'd down to her very heels In her fair hair (whence still sweet deaw distils) Half hanging down; the rest in rings and curls, Platted with strings of great, round, orient Pearls: Her gown is Damask of a Silver-ground, With Silver Seas all deeply-frenged round; With Gourds and Moon-wort branched richly-fair, Flourisht with beasts that onely eat the Air. But why, my Muse, with Pencill so precise Seek'st thou to paint all her rich Rarities? Of all the Bewties, Graces, Honors, Riches, Wherewith rich Heav'n these Maskers all inriches, Shee's even the Mother: and then, as a Glasse, On the Behoulders their effects shee casts. Sol.A Garland, braided with the Flowry foulds Of yellow Citrons, Turn-Sols, Mary-goulds, Beset with Bal'nites, Rubies, Chrysolites, The royall Bride-groom's radiant brows be-dights: His saffron'd Ruffe is edged richly-neat With burning Carbuncles, and every set Wrought rarely-fine with branches (draw'n vpon) Of Laurell, Cedar, Balm and Cinnamon: On his Gold-grounded Robe the Swan so white Seems to his honour som new Song t'indite. The Phœnix there builds both her nest and tomb: The Crocodile out of the waves doth com: Th'amazed Reaper down his sickle flings; And sudden Fear grafts to his Ankles wings. There the fierce Lion, from his furious ey, His mouth and nosthrils, fiery Flames lets-fly, Seems with his whisking train his rage to whet; And, wrath-full ramping, ready even to set Vpon a Heard of fragrant Leopards: When lo, the Cock (that light his rage regards) A purple Plume timbers his stately Crest, On his high Gorget and broad hardy Brest A rich Coat-Armour (Or and Azure) shines, Afrenge of raveld gold about his Loins, In lieu of Bases. Beard as red as blood; A short Beak bending like the Eagles brood: Green-yellow eyes, where Terrours Tent is pight; A Martiall gait, and spurred as a Knight: Into two arches his proud Train divides, With painted wings hee claps his cheerfull sides, Sounds his shrill Trumpet, and seems with his sight The Lions courage to have danted quight. These happy Lovers, with a practiz'd pase, Forward and backward and a-side doo trace; They seem to dance the Spanish Pavane right: And yet their Dance, so quick and lively-light, Doth never pass the Baldricks bounds (at all) Which grav'n with Star-Beasts over-thwarts the Hall. When the brave Bride-groom towards Mount Silo traces, A thousand Flowrs spring in his spritefull pases: When towards Mount Olivet hee slides, there growes Vnder his feet a thousand Frosty Snowes: For, the Floor, beaten with his Measures ever, Seems like the Footing of the nimble Weaver. This lovely Couple now kisse, now recoil, Now with a lowring ey, now with a smile: Now Face to Face they Dance, now side by side, With Course vn-equall: and the tender Bride Receives strange Changes in her Countenance, After her Lovers divers-seeming glance. If vnawares som Envious com between Her and her Love, then is shee sad be-seen, Shee shuts her ey, shee seems even to depart: Such force hath true Love in a noble heart. But all that's nothing to their Musick choice: Tuning the warbles of their Angell-Voice To Foot and Viol, and Care-charming Lute, In amorous Ditty thus doo they dispute; “O bright-ey'd Virgin! O how fair thou art! The Epithalamy. “O how I love thee, My Snowe-winged Dove! “O how I love thee! Thou hast rapt my heart: “For thee I Dy: For thee I Live, my Love. “How fair art thou, my Dear! How dear to mee! “Dear Soule (awake) I faint, I sink, I swoun “At thy dear Sight: and, when I sleep, for Thee “Within my brest still wakes my sharp-sweet Wound. “My Loue, what Odours thy sweet Tresse it yields! “What Amber-greece, what Incense breath'st thou out “From purple fillets! and what Myrrhe distils “Still from thy Fingers, ringd with Gold about! “Sweet-Heart, how sweet is th'Odour of thy Prayse! “O what sweet airs doth thy sweet air deliver “Vnto my burning Soule! What hony Layes “Flowe from thy throat! thy throat a golden River. “Among the Flowrs, my Flowr's a Rose, a Lilly: “A Rose, a Lilly; this a Bud, that blow'n: “This fragrant Flowr first of all gather will-I, “Smell to it, kisse it, wear it as mine owne. “Among the Trees, my Love's an Apple-Tree, “Thy fruitfull Stem bears Flowr and Fruit together: “I'll smell thy Flowr, thy Fruit shall nourish mee, “And in thy Shadow will I rest for ever. While Hesperus in azure Waggon brought Millions of Tapers over all the Vault, These gorgeous Revels to sweet Rest give place, And the Earths Venus doth Heav'ns Venus trace. These Spousals past, the King doth nothing minde But The Lords House; there is his care confin'd: His Checker's open, hee no cost respects; But sets a-work the wittiest Architects. The building of the TEMPLE.Millions of hands bee busie labouring; Through all the Woods, wedges and beetles ring: The tufted tops of sacred Libanon, To climb Mount Sion, down the stream are gon: Forrests are saw'd in Transoms, Beams and Somers; Great Rocks made little, what with Sawes and Hammers: The sturdy Quar-man with steel-headed Cones And massie Sledges slenteth out the stones, Digs through the bowels of th'Earth baked stiff, Cuts a wide Window through a horned Cliff Of ruddy Porphyre, or white Alabaster, And masters Marble, which no Time can master. One melts the White-stone with the force of Fire: Another, leveld by the Lesbian Squire, Deep vnder ground (for the Foundation) ioins Well-polisht Marble, in long massie Coins; Such, both for stuff, and for rare artifice, As might beseem som royall Frontispice. This heaws a Chapter; that a Frize doth frame; This carves a Cornich; that prepares a Iambe; This forms a Plynth; that fits an Architrave; This planes a Plank: and that the same doth grave, Gives life to Cedars dead, and cunningly Makes Wood to move, to sigh and speak well-ny: And others, rearing high the sacred Wall, By their bould Labours Heav'n it self appall: Cheerly they work, and ply it in such sort As if they thought long Summer-daies too-short. As in Grape-Harvest, with vnweary pains, Simile. A willing Troop of merry-singing Swains With crooked hooks the strouting Clusters cut, In Frails and Flaskets them as quickly put, Run bow'd with burdens to the fragrant Fat, Tumble them in, and after pit-a-pat Vp to the Waste; and, dancing in the Must, To th'vnder-Tub a flowry showr doo thrust: They work a-vie, to th'ey their Work doth growe, Who saw't i'th' Morning, scarce at Night can knowe It for the same: and God himself doth seem T'have taen to task this Work, and work for them While in the Night sweet Sleep restores with rest The weary limbs of Work-men over-prest. Great King, whence cam this Courage (Titan-like) So many Hils to heap vpon a rick? What mighty Rowlers, and what massie Cars Could bring so far so many monstrous Quars? And, what huge strength of hanging Vaults embow'd Bears such a waight above the winged Clowd? If on the out-side I doo cast mine ey, The Stones are ioyn'd so artificially, That if the Mason had not checkerd fine Syrian. Syre's Alabaster with hard Serpentine, And hundred Marbles no less fair then firm; The whole, a whole Quar one might rightly tearm. If I look In, then scorn I all with-out: Surpassing Riches shineth all about: Floor, Sides and Seeling cover'd triple-fould, Stone lin'd with Cedar, Cedar limn'd with Gould: And all the Parget carv'd and branched trim With Flowrs and Fruits, and winged Cherubim. I over-passe the sacred Implements, In worth far passing all these Ornaments: Th'Art answers to the stuff, the stuff to th'vse. O perfect Artist! thou for Mould didst chuse The Worlds Idëa: For, as first the same Was sever'd in a Three-fould divers Frame, And God Almighty rightly did Ordain One all Divine, one Heav'nly, one Terrene; Decking with Vertues one, with Stars another, With Flowrs, and Fruits, and Beasts, and Birds, the other: And plaid the Painter, when hee did so gild The turning globes, blew'd seas, and green'd the field, Gave precious stones so many coloured luster, Enameld Flowrs, made Metals beam and glister: The Carver, when hee cut in leaves and stems Of Plants, such veins, such figures, files and hems: The Founder, when hee cast so many Forms Of winged Fowls, of Fish, of Beasts, of Worms: Thou doost diuide this Sacred House in Three; Th'Holy of Holies, wherein none may bee But God, the Cherubins, and (once a year) The Sacred Figure of Perfection dear, Of God's eternal Son (Sins sin-less check) The everlasting true Melchisedec: The fair mid-Temple, which is ope alone To Sun-bright Levits, who on Izrael shone With Rayes of Doctrine; and who, feeding well On the Lawes Hony, seem in Heav'n to dwell: And th'vtter Porch, the Peoples residence, The Vulgars Ile, the World of Elements: And various Artist honour'st all the Parts With Myron's, Phidias, and Apelles Arts. This Pattern pleas'd thee so, th'hast fram'd by it Th'eternall Watch-births of thy sacred Wit: Thy pithy Book of Proverbs, richly-graue, Vnto the Porch may right relation have; For that it gives vs O economike Lawes, Rules politike, and private civill Sawes; And (for the most) those Lessons generall At Humane matters aim the most of all. Ecclesiastes the Mid-Temple seems: It treadeth down what-ever Flesh esteems Fair, pleasant, precious, glorious, good or great; Drawes vs from earth, and vs in Heav'n doth seat; And, all the World proclaiming Vain of Vains, Mans happinesse in Gods true Fear maintains. Sanctvm-Sanctorvm is thy Song of Songs, Where, in Mysterious Verse (as meet belongs) Thou mariest Iacob to Heav'ns glorious King: Where, thou (devoted) doost divinely sing Christ's and his Chvrches Epithalamy: Where (sweetly rapt in sacred Extasie) The faithfull Soule talks with her God immense, Hears his sweet Voice, herself doth quintessence In the pure flames of his sweet-pearcing eyes (The Cabinets where Grace and Glory lies) Enioyes her Ioy, in her chaste bed doth kisse His holy lips (the Love of Loves) her Blisse. When hee had finisht and had furnisht full The House of God, so rich, so beautifull; O God, said Salomon, great Onely-Trine! Dedication of the Temple. Which of this Mystike sacred House of Thine Hast made mee Builder; build mee in the same A living Stone. For thy dear David's name, On David's branches David's blisse revive; That on his Throne his Issue still may thrive. O All-comprising, None-comprised Prince, Which art in Heav'n by thy Magnificence, In Hell by Iustice, each-where by thy Powrs, Dwell heer, dear Father, by thy grace (to Ours). If, in a doubtfull Case, one needs must swear, Loose thou the Knot, and punish thou severe Th'audacious Perjure; that hence-forth none chance Tax thee of Malice, or of Ignorance. If our dis-flowred Trees, our Fields Hail-torn, Our empty Ears, our light and blasted Corn, Presage vs Famine; If, with ten-fold chain, Thy hand hath lockt thy Water-gates of Rain; And, towards this House wee humbled cast our ey, Hear vs, O Lord, hear our complaint and cry. If Captives wee in a strange Land bewail, If in the Wars our Force and Fortune fail; And, towards this House wee humbled cast our ey, Hear vs, O Lord, hear our complaint and cry. If Strangers, moov'd with rumour of thy Miracles, Com heer to Offer, to consult thine Oracles, And in this House to kneel religiously, Hear them, O Lord, hear their complaint and cry: Hear them from Heav'n; and, by thy Favors prest, Draw to Thy Temple, North, South, East and West. The passe-Man Wisdom of th'Isacian Prince, A Light so bright, set in such eminence (Vn-hideable by enuious Arrogance, Vnder the Bushell of black Ignorance) Shines every where, illustres every place: Among the rest it Lightens in the Face Of the fair Princesse, that with prudent hand The soft Arabian Scepter doth command, The Queen of Saba, where continuall Spring The Queen of Saba. Red Cinnamon, Incense and Myrrhe doth bring; Where private men doo Prince-like Treasures hould, Where Pots bee Silver, Bedsteds beaten Gould, Where Wals are rough-cast with the richest Stones, Cast in Devices, Emblems, Scutchions. Yet, leaving all this Greatnes of her owne, Shee coms to view the State of Salomon, To hear his Wisdom, and to see his City, Refuge of Vertues, School of Faith and Pity. A iust reproofe of all obstinate Recusants.You that doo shut your eyes against the raies Of glorious Light, which shineth in our dayes; Whose spirits, self-obstin'd in old musty Error, Repulse the Truth (th'Almightie's sacred Mirror) Which day and night at your deaf Doors doth knock; Whose stubbornnesse will not at all vn-lock The sacred Bible, nor so much as look, To talk with God, into his holy Book: O, fear you not, that this great Princesse shall Of thank-less Sloath one day condemne you all? Who (both a Woman, Queen, and Pagan born) Ease, Pleasures, Treasures, doth despise and scorn; To passe with great pains, and with great expence, Long weary Iourneys full of diffidence; And nobly trauels to another Land To hear the words but of a (mortall) Man? Her Time's not lost: there (rapt) shee doth contemple The sumptuous beauties of a stately Temple, The lofty Towrs of hundred Towns in one, A pompous Palace, and a Peer-less Throne, Wals rich without; furnisht in richer sort: Number of Servants doth adorne the Court, But more their Order. There, no noise is heard, Each his owne Office onely doth regard: And (in one instant) as the quaverings Of a quick Thumb move all the divers strings Of a sweet Guittern; and, its skill to grace, Causeth a Treble sound, a Mean, a Base: So Salomon, discreetly with a beck, A wink, a word, doth all the Troops direct: Each of his Servants hath his proper Lesson, And (after his Degree) each hath his fashion. This Queen, yer parting from her fragrant Iles, Arm'd her with Riddles and with witty Wiles, T'appose the King; and shee resolves shee will With curious Questions sift and sound his Skill. But lo what Oedipus! The Law-learn'd Sage, Which at the Bar hath almost spent his age, Cannot so soon a common Doubt decide, Where Statutes, Customs, and Book-Cases guide, As hee dissolves her Gordian-knots, and sees Through all her nights, and even at pleasure frees Such doubts, as doubt-less might haue taskt (t'vntwist) The Brachman, Druïde, and Gymnosophist: And knowing, Good becoms more Good, the more It is en-common'd, hee applies therefore T'instruct her in the Faith; and (enuious-idle) His brains rich Talent buries not in Idle. Alas, I pitie you: alas (quoth He) Poor Soules besotted in Idolatrie, Who worship Gold and Siluer, Stocks and Stones, Mens workmanship, and Fiends Illusions; And, who (by your sage Mages Lore mis-led) So-many Godlings haue imagined: Madame, there is but one sole God, most-High, Th'Eternall King; nay, self-Eternitie. Infinit, All in all, yet out of all, Of Ends the End, of Firsts Originall, Of Lights the Light, Essence surpassing Essence, Of Powers pure Act, of Acts the very Puissance, Cause of all Causes, Ocean of all Good, The Life of Life, and of all Bewty Flood: None-seen All-Seer, Starr's guide, Sight of Seeing, The Vni-forme, which giues all forms their Beeing. God, and One, is all One; whoso the Vnitie Denies, he (Atheist) disannuls Diuinitie: Th'Vnitie dwels in God, ith' Fiend the Twine: The greater World hath but one Sun to shine, The lesser but one Soule, both but one God, In Essence One, in Person Trinely-odde. Of this great Frame, the Parts so due-devis'd, This Bodie, tun'd so, measur'd, sympathiz'd, This Temple, where such Wealth and Order meet, This Art in every part cannot proceed. But from one Pattern; and that but from one Author of all, who all preserues alone. Else should we see in set Batalions A hundred thousand furious Partizans, The World would nource civill intestine Wars, And wrack it selfe in it selfs factious Iars. Besides, God is an infinite Divinity: And who can think of more than one Infinity? Seeing the one restrains the others might, Or rather reaues its name and beeing quite. Therefore (O Pagans) why doe you confine The Infinite in narrow Walls of lime? Why shut you Him in a base Trunk or Tree? Why paint you Whom no mortall eye can see? Why offer you your carnall seruices Vnto the Lord, who a meer Spirit is? Why then do you (sayd she) by our example, Inclose th'Immortall in this earthly Temple? Lock him within an Arke? and, worse than we, Feed him with Fumes, and bloody Butchery? This Sacred House so fair (reply'd he then) Is not to contain God, but godly men Which worship him: and, we doe not suppose That He, whose Arms doo Heav'n and Earth inclose, Is closed in a Chest; but th'ancient Pact, The solemne Couenant, and the sure Contract, Which leagues vs with our God, and each with other, And (holy Bond) holds Heav'n and Earth together. As for our Incense, Washings, Sacrifices, They are not (as is thought) Our vain Devices; But, God's their Author, and himselfe Ordains These Elements, whereby he entertaines And feeds our vnderstanding in the hope Of his deer Son (of all these Things the Scope); Setting before vs th'Only Sacrifice, Which in Christ's Blood shall wash-out all our vice. Come then, O Lord, Come thou Lawes finisher, Great King, great Prophet, great Selfs-Offerer: Come, come thou thrice Great Refuge of our State, Come, thou our Rançome, Iudge and Advocate: Milde Lamb, Salue-Serpent, Lion generous, Vn-chalendg'd Vmpire betwixt Heav'n and Vs, Come thou the Truth, the Substance and the End Of all our Offrings (whither, all doo tend): Come O Messias, and doo now begin To Raign in Sion, to triumph of Sin; And, worshipped in Spirit and Truth, restore Vpon the Earth the Golden Age of yore: Accept this Queen, as of all Heathen Princes The deer First-Fruits: take on thee our Offences, That, stript of Adam's sinfull sute, in fine With sacred Angels we in Heavn'n may shine. The Queen, nigh sunk in an Amazefull Swoun, Bespake him thus: My Lord, prattling renown Is wont in flying to increase so far, That she proclaims things greater then they are: Simile.And, rarest Spirits resemble Pictures right, Whereof the rarest seem more exquisite, Far-off, then neer: but, so far as thy Fame Excels all Kings, thy vertues passe the same: Thy peer-less Praise stoops to thy Learned tongue, And envious bruit hath done thy Wisedom wrong. So may I say, even so (O Scottish King) Application to the Kings Maiestie.Thy winged Fame, which far and wide doth ring, From th'edge of Spain hath made me ventrously To crosse the Seas, thy Britain's end to see: Where (Lord!) what saw I? nay, what saw I not? O King (Heav'n-chosen, for som speciall Plot) World's Miracle, O Oracle of Princes? I saw so much, my Soule mistrusts my Senses. A gray-beards Wisedom in an amber-bush, A Mars-like Courage in a Maid-like blush, A settled Iudgement with a supple Wit, A quick Discourse, profound and pleasing yet; Virgil and Tully, in one spirit infus'd, And all Heav'ns Gifts into one Head diffus'd. Persist, O King, glory on glory mount: And as thy Vertues thine owne Fame surmount, So let thy future passe thy former more, And go-before those that have gone-before: Excell thy self: and, brave, grave, godly Prince, Confirm my Songs eternall Evidence. FINIS. The Schisme. THE THIRD BOOK OF THE FOVRTH DAY OF THE II. WEEK. The Argvment. Reiecting Olde, Young-Counsail'd rash Roboam Loseth Ten Tribes; which fall to Ieroboam, He, Godding Calves, makes Izrael to Sin: His Scepter therefore shortly fails his Kin. Baaz, Zimri, Omri, Achab (worst of all) With Iezabel. Elias conquers Baal; Commands the Clouds; rapt-vp to Heav'n, aliue. Elisha's Works: his bones the dead reviue. Samaria's tragick Siege. A Storm at Sea, For Ionas sake: repentant Ninive. The miserie of a State distracted by factions into Ciuill Wars. Heer sing I Isaac's civill Brauls and Broils; Iacobs Revolt; their Cities sack, their Spoils: Their cursed Wrack, their Godded Calues: the rent Of th'Hebrew Tribes from th'Isheans Regiment. Ah! see we not, som seek the like in France? With rage-full swords of civill Variance, To share the sacred Gaulian Diadem? Application.To strip the Lillies from their natiue stem? And (as it were) to Cantonize the State Whose Law did aw Imperiall Rhine (of late) Tiber and Iber too; and vnder whom Even silver Iordan's captiue floods did foam. Deprecation.But, let not vs, good Lord, O let not vs Serue servilely a hundred Kinglings thus, In stead of one great Monarch: never let The lawfull Heir from his owne Throne be beat; This Scepter yearly to be new possest; Nor every Town to be a Tyrants nest: Keep all intire, re-stablish prudent Raign, Restore the Sword to Iustice hand again; That, blest with Peace, thy blessed Praise (O Lord) My thankfull Layes may more and more record. The General States of Israel, gathered all, A Parliament or Assembly of the Estates of Israel. By thousands now, within strong Sichem's Wall; All ioyntly name Roboam for their King, But (strictly stout) his Powr thus limiting: Command (say they) and Rule in Abram's Fold, Not as a Wolf, but as a Shepheard should: The People capitulate with their new King. Slacken the reans of our late Servitude: Lighten our gall'd backs of those Burthens rude, Those heauy imposts of thy Father (fierce): Repress the rapin of thine Officers: So, we will serue thee, life and goods at-once: If other-wife; thy service we renounce. Heer-with amaz'd, thee moody Prince, in post Sends for those Ancients which had swayed most His Fathers Counsails: and he seems to crave Their sage Advices, in a case so grave. God hath not made, say they (iumping together) The Counsail of the ancient Nobles. Subiects for Kings, but Kings for Subiects rather: Then, let not thine (already in distress) Be gnaw'n by others; by thy Self much less. What boots a Head, with-out the hand and foot? What is a Scepter, and no Subiects to't? The greater Milt, the Bodie pines the more: The Checker's fatting makes the people poor: A Princes Wealth in Subiects Wealth is set: The Bank of Thrift, where gold doth gold beget: Where the good Prince coms never but at need: For, hee is prais'd for a good Heard (indeed) Whose Flock is fat and fair, with frolik bounds Frisking and skipping vp and down the Douns. Among the Beasts fullest of furious gall, The Vulgar's fiercest, wildest, worst of all; Hydra with thousand heads, and thousand stings, Yet soon agreed to war against their Kings. If then you wish, their barking rage to cease Cast them a bone; by an abatement, cease Their wringing Yoak, thy pity let them proue: And ground thy Greatness on thy Peoples loue. Or, if thou (fell) wilt needs feed on their ice, Yet vse no threats, nor giue them flat Denies: But, to establish thy yet-new estate, Giue them som hope, and let them feed on that: And (wisely) minde thy Fathers Saying sage, That A soft answer (soon) appeaseth rage. Roboam, leauing their sound aduice leaneth rather to the young furie of his Minions &amp; Flatterers. Roboam, scorning these old Senators, Leans to his Yonglings, Minions, Flatterers (Birds of of a feather) that with one accord Cry-out, importune, and perswade their Lord, Not sillily to be by such disturb'd, Nor let him-selfe so simply to be curb'd; But, to repress, press, and oppress the more These Mal-contents, but too-well vs'd before: With iron teeth to bruise their idle bones, To suck their Marrow out; and (for the nonce) Their rebell Pride to fetter (as if were) And lock their Furie in the stocks of Fear, And to shake-off (on th'other side) and shun Those Gray-beards old and cold direction, Their sawcy censures, snibbing his Minority; Where-by (too-proud) they trip at his Authority, Vsurp his place; and (too-too-malapert) Would teach a wiser then themselues his part: To knowe that hee's a King; and that hee took Even in the womb, as th'outward limbs and look, So th'inward graces, the Discretion And deep Fore-sight of prudent Salomon; And, in the shop of Nature, learn'd (long since) The Art of State, the Office of a Prince. Wisdom (fond King) her sacred Seat erects In hoarie brains: and Day the Day directs: Th'old-man-fore-sees a-far; by past events He (prudent) ponders future accidents: The Young-man knowes not (new-com, as it were) This wily World, but as a passenger; And, more with courage then with Counsail's guide, Barely beholds things on the outer side. Yet, to the last thou lean'st; and, frowning fell, Checkst thus the Sons, of noble Israel: The Kings rashness threatning rigour.Ah! rebell Slaues! you, you will Rule your King: You'l be his Carvers: you will clip his wing: You'l hold the sacred helm, Controule the Crown: You'l rate his State, and turn all vp-side-down. But, know you (varlets) whom you dally-with? My little finger over-balanceth My Father's loigns: he did but rub you light, I'l slay your backs, he bow'd, I'l break yee quight. He threatned Rods (or gentle Whips of cord) But I will haue your carrion shoulders goar'd With scourges tangd with rowels: and my Name Shall make you quake, if you but hear the same. As rapid streams, incountring in their way Simile. With close-driv'n piles of som new bank or bay, Or steady pillers of a Bridge built new, Which last-past Sommer never saw, nor knew; Swell, roar, and rage far fiercer then they wont, And with their foam defile the Welkins front: So yerst griev'd Isaac, now growen desperate, With loud proud tearms doth thus expostulate: Why? what haue we to do (what part? what place?) The Reuolt of the 10. Tribes. With Boözean Ishay's avaricious race? Go, Raign (proud Iuda) where thou wilt; for we Nill bear the burthen of thy Tyranny: Go vse else-where thy cruell threats and braves; We are thy Brethren, we, and not thy Slaves. Thus cry the People, and th'ill-counsail'd King Vn-kingly yeelds to their rude mutining: And flies eft-soons with som few Beniamites, The zealous Levites, and the Iudaïtes: The rest revolt, and chuse for Soverain A shame-less, faith-less, bold and busie-brain, An Ephraimite, who (double-false) doth fall Both from his King and from his God withall. Ieroboam. For, he fore-sees, that if th'Isacians still (As Law inioyn'd) should mount on Sion Hill, To sacrifice; with beautie of that Temple, Their Princes sight, the Doctrine and Example Of sacred Leuites, they would soon be taken, And drawn aboord the Bark they had forsaken. To rent the Church therefore he doth devise, And God's true Spouse doth Harlot-like disguise: Will haue them hence-forth worship God the Lord Vnder the Form of Hay-fed Calues (abhorr'd) In Dan and Bethel: brings vp Service new: Profane, vsurping sacred Aaron's Dew. But, how (ingrate) requit'st thou God, in this? He, of a Servant, made thee King of His: Thou, of a God, mak'st him a horned Steer; Sett'st Altar against Altar; and, the deer, Cleer Star of Truth beclouding with the vail Of thine Ambition, mak'st all Israel fail, And fall with-all into the Gulfe of Death, So deep (alas!) that from thence-forth, vn-eath Could th'operation of so many Miracles, In their hard hearts reprint the Sacred Oracles. One-day, the while this Priest-King sacrifiz'd) To's clov'n-foot God in Bethel (self-deviz'd) A zealous Prophet from the Lord there came, Who boldly thus his brutish rage doth blame: O odious House, O execrable Cell, O Satans Forge, O impious Shop of Hell; Accursed Altar, that so braves and boasts Against the Altar of the Lord of Hoasts! Behold, from Dauid shall a King return That on thy stones thine owne Priests bones shall burn, Thus saith the Lord: and this shall be the Signe (Prodigiously to seal his Word in mine) Thou now in th'instant shalt in sunder shatter, And in the Air shall thy vile cinders scatter. Take, take the Sot, said then th'vngodly Prince, And (as he spake in rage-full vehemence) Reacht-out his arm: but, instantly the same So strangely withered and so num became, And God so rustied every ioynt, that there (But as the Body stird) it could not stir: Th'vnsacred Altar sudden slent in twain; And th'ashes, flying through th'vn-hallowed Fane, Simile.Blinde the blinde Priests; as in the Sommer (oft) The light, white Dust (driv'n by the Winde aloft) Whirling about, offends the tendrest eye, And makes the Shepheards (with-out cause) to cry. O holy Prophet (prayes the Tyrant then) Deer man of God, restore my hand again: His hand is heal'd. But (obstinate in ill) In His Calf-service He persevers still, Still runs his Race, still every day impairs, And of his Sins makes all his Sons his heirs, The King of Iuda little better proves, His Fathers by-paths so Abijam loves; The People, pliant to their Princes guise, Forget their God, and his drad Law despise. God, notwithstanding (of his speciall grace) Entails the Scepter to the sacred race Of his deer Dauid: and he bindes with boughs Of glorious Laurels their victorious brows: And evermore (how-ever Tyrants rave) Som form of Church in Sion he will have. Aza, Abijam's Son; Iehosaphat The son of Aza (rightly zealous) hate All Idol-gods: and, warring with success, Dung Isaac's Fields with forrain carcasses. In Aza's ayd fights th'arm armi-potent Aza.(Which shakes the Heav'ns, rakes Hils, and Rocks doth rent) Against black Zerah's overdaring boast, That with drad deluge of a Million-Hoast O'r-flow'd all Iuda; and, all sacking (fell) Transported Afrik into Israel: He fights for His; who, seeing th'Ammonite, The Idumæan, and proud Moabite, In Battail 'ray, caus'd all his Hoast to sing This Song aloud, them thus encouraging: Sa, sa (my hearts) let's cheerly to the charge; Having for Captain, for Defence, and Targe, That glorious Prince to whom the raging Sea Hath heretofore, in foming pride, giv'n way: Who, with a sigh (or with a whistle, rather) Can call the North, South, East, and West together: Who, at a beck, or with a wink, commands Millions of millions of bright-winged-bands: Who, with a breath, brings (in an instant) vnder The proudest Powrs: whose arrows are the Thunder. While yet they sang, fell Discord reaching-far, Hies to the Heathen that encamped are: Description of Discord. Clean through her mantle (tatterd all in flakes) Appears her brest all-ouer gnaw'n with Snakes, Her skin is scarr'd, her teeth (for rage) doo gnash, The Basilisk with-in her eyes doth flash; And, one by one, she plucks-off (in despight) Her hairs (no hairs, but hissing Serpents right) And, one by one, she severally bestowes-'em Through all the Camp, in every Captains bosom, Blowes every vein full of her furious mood, Burns every Souldier with the thirst of blood: And, with the same blade that she died once In valiant Gedeon's (Brother-slaughtered) Sons, Shee sets the Brother to assail the Brother, The Son the Sier, and deerest friends each-other. The swords, new draw'n against their Enemies, Miraculous slaughter of the Heathen by their mutual swords, diuided among themselues. Now (new revolted) hack their owne Allies: And Mars so mads them in their mutuall Iar, That strange, turns civill; civill, houshold War: Proud Edom heaws Moab and th'Ammonite; Amon hunts Edom and the Moabite; Moab assaults Amon and Edom too; And each of them was first with th'other two, Then with themselues: then Amon Amon thrills, Moab wounds Moab, Edom Edom kills. From Hoast to Hoast, blind-fold Despair, in each, Disports her selfe; those that are one in speech, Vnder one Colours, of one very coat, Combat each other, cut each others throat. Rage-full confusion every-where commands, The confusion of such a Campe so together by the cars. Against his Captain the Lieutenant stands, The Corporall vpon his Seriant flies, And basest Boyes against their Masters rise. Nay, drad Bellona passeth fiercely further, Th'owne Vncle doth his owne deer Nephew murther, The Nephew th'Vncle with the like repayes, Cosen thrils Cosen, Kins-man Kins-man slayes: Yea, even the Father kils his Son most cruell, And from one Belly springs a bloody Duell; Twins fiercely fight: and while each woundeth other, And drawes the life-blood of his half-selfe Brother, Feels not his owne to fail, till in the place Both fall; as like in fury as in face: But, strength at length (not stomach) fails in either; And, as together born, they die together. The faithfull Hoast drawes neer, and gladly goes Viewing the bodies of their breath-less Foes. Men, Camels, Horse (som saddled, som with-out) Pikes, Quivers, Darts, lie mingled all about The bloody Field; and from the Mountains nigh The Rav'ns begin with their pork-porking cry: Heer seems an Arm, a Giant late did owe, As if it would to a Dwarf's shoulder growe: A Princes hand there (knowen by precious signes) Vnto the arm of a base Porter ioynes; An olde-Man's head heer to a Stripling's neck; And there lean buttocks to a brawny back: Heer of a bodie iustly cloven in two, The bloody tripes are trailing to and fro; There, fiue red fingers of a hand cut-off Gripe still the truncheon of a steeled staff; And, there (at-once, all broached on one Lance) Lie three braue Horse-men in a deadly Transe. Chariots, vnfurnisht and vnharnest, stood, Over the spoaks, vp to the naves in blood: Th'Engaddian Snowes melt in vermilion streams, And (now no marvell) Iarvel warmly steams, Stopt with dead bodies; so, that never-more It should haue seen the Ocean (as before) Nor payd the Tribute that his Dutie craves, Saue that the crimsin holp the crystall waves. Praised be God (sayd Iuda) praised be The Lord of Hoasts, the King of Maiesty, That moawes his Foes; that doth his owne protect, That holds so deer the blood of his Elect; That fights for vs, and teacheth vs to fight, Conquer, and triumph of the Pagan's might; And (finally) doth punish Tyrants fell, With their owne swords, to saue his Israel. Wicked generation of the wicked.But, notwithstanding Ieroboam's Plot, His third Successor yet succeeds him not; A barbarous Furie raigneth in his Race, His bloody Scepter shifteth hands apace: Nadab his son, and all his seed beside, Feels cursed Baasha's cruell Paricide; And Baasha's issue is by Zimri slain, Zimri by Zimri: then doth Omri raign; Omri, accursed for his owne transgression, But more accursed for the foule succession Of such a Son as Achab (sold to Sin) That boldly brings Sidonian Idols in, Builds vnto Baal; and, of all Kings the worst, Weds Iezabel, adds Drunkenness to Thirst. Blind Superstion's like a drop of Oyl 2. Smile. Still spreading, till it all a Garment spoyl: Or, like a spark, fall'n in a floor of Mat, Which soon inflameth all the Chamber; that, Fires the whole House; the House, the Town about; Consuming all, and never going-out, Till Goods, and Bodies, Towrs and Temples high, All in a Toomb of their owne ashes lie: When one begins (how little be't) to stray From the divine Law's little-beaten way, We cursed fall into the black Abysse Of all foul Errors: every Sin that is Donns sacred Mask; and, monsters most abhord, Killing the Saints we think to please the Lord, As Achab did; who vanquisht with the spel, Speach, grace, and face of painted Iezabel, Presumes to lay his sacrilegious hand On th'oyled Priests that in Gods presence stand, Of honest Men his Towns depopulates, Lessens the Number of his Noble States, T'augment his Lands; and, with the blood of His, Writes th'Instruments of his new Purchases. But slain (at last) by th'Hoast of Benhadad, His Son Ahaziah. succeeds him, (and almost as bad) He breakes his neck, and leaues his fatall place, To's brother Ioram, last of Achab's race; An odious race, th'alliance of whose blood Corrupts the Heirs of Iosaphat the good, Causing his Son (charm'd with Athalia's wile) In's Brother's blood his armed arms to file, And Ahaziah's giddy brain t'infect With the damn'd Error of Samarian Sect. But though these Kings did openly oppugn And stubbornly the King of Heav'n impugn; Though Abrah'ms issue (now degenerate) Did but too-neer their Princes imitate; Though over all, a Chaos of confusion, A Hell of Horror, Murder, and Delusion, A Sea of Sins (contempt of God and Good) Cover'd these Kingdoms (as another Flood): God left not yet that Age without his Oracles: A hundred Prophets, strong in word and miracles, Resist their rage, and from sad drowning keep The wracked planks on th'Idol-Ocean deep. Simile.Cleer Sommer Noons need not a candle-light; Nor sound, Physician; but clean opposite: So, in our Soules, the more Sin's Floods do flowe, The more God makes his Mercie's Gulfe to growe. Elijah the Prophet.For his Embassage in sad Achab's dayes, Thesbite Elijah did th'Almighty rayse; Who, burning-bold in spirit and speech, cries-out, In Achab's ears, and all his Court about: O impious Achab, fear'st thou not quoth he) The sulphury flames and Thunder-bolts that be Already roaring in the dreadfull fist Of God the Lord, that doth the proud resist, Revengeth wrongs, th'outrageous Heathens Hammer, Terror of Terrors, and all Tyrants Tamer? Doost thou not knowe, He threats to Israel A Heav'n of Brass, if they his grace repel, Reiect his loue, and get them other Loues, Whoring about with forrain Gods, in Groves? God cannot lie: his dreadfull Threatnings ever Draw dreadfull Iudgements (if our Sin persever): As the Lord liues, this Thirstie yawning Plain In seav'n six month's drinks not a drop of Rain. Description of the extreame Drought in Israel for three years &amp; a half.No sooner spoken, but in present view, The Heav'ns begin to change their wonted hew; Th'Ayre deadly thick, doth quickly vanish quight; To a sad Day succeeds a sadder Night: A bloody vapour and a burning cloud, By day, begirt the Sun (all coaly-browd); By night, the Moon denies to fading Flowrs Her silver sweat, and pearly-purled showrs: The Welkin's studded with new Blazing-Stars, Flame-darting Lances, fiery Crowns and Cars, Kids, Lions, Bears, wrapt in prodigious Beams, Dreadfull to see: and Phœbus (as it seems) Wearie of travail in so hot a time, Rests all the while in boyling Cancer's clime. Hils, lately hid with snowe, now burn amain: May hath no Deaw, nor February Rain: Sad Atlas Nieces, and the Hunter's Star Have like effect as the Canicular: Zephyre is mute, and not a breath is felt, But hectik Auster's, which doth all things swelt, And (panting-short) puffs every-where vpon The withered Plains of wicked Shomeron, Th'vnsauory breath of Serpents crawling o're The Lybians pest-full and vn-blest-full shoar. Now Herbs to fail, and Flowrs to fall began; The miserable effects thereof. Mirtles and Bayes for want of moyst grew wan: With open mouth the Earth the ayd doth crave Of black-blew Clouds: cleer Kishon's rapid wave Wars now no more with Bridges arched round; Soreck, for shame, now hides him vnder ground: Mokmur, whose murmur troubled with the noise The sleeping Shepheards, hath nor stream, nor voice: Cedron's not Cedron, but (late) Cedron's bed, And Iordan's Current is as dry, as dead. The beam-brow'd Stag, and strong-neckt Bull do ly On pale-faç't banks of Arnon (also dry) But, neither, sup, nor see the Crystall Wave, Ouer the which so often swom they have: The lusty Courser, that late scorn'd the ground, Now lank and lean, with crest and courage downd, With rugged tongue out of his chained mouth, With hollow-flanks panting for inward drouth, Rouling his Bit, but with a feeble rumor, Would sweat for faintness, but he wanteth humour: The Towr-backt Camel, that best brooketh Thirst, And on his bunch could have transported yerst Neer a whole Houshold, now is able scant To bear himself, he is so feebly-faint. Both yong and olde, both of the base and best, Feele a fell Ætna in their thirstie brest: To temper which, they breath, but to their wo: For, for pure air, they sup into them, so, A putride, thick, and pestilentiall fume, Which stuffs their Lights, and doth their lives consume. Ther's not a Puddle (though it strangely stink) But dry they draw't, Sea-Water's dainty Drink: And fusty-Bottles, from beyond-Sea (South) Bring Nile to Somer, for the Kings owne mouth. For, though the Lord th'whole Land of Syria smites, Th'heat of his Anger on Samaria lights With greatest force; whose furious Prince implies The prophet Cause of all these miseries. Therefore, he fearing Achab's ragefull hate, Down to Brook Cherith's hollow banks he gate; Where, for his Cooks, Caters, and Wayters, tho From the foure windes the winged people go. Thence, to Sareptha; where he craves the ayd Of a poor Widow: who thus mildely said, Alas! fain would I, but (God wot) my store Is but of bread for one meal, and no more: Yet, give me (saith he) giue me som (I pray); Who soweth sparing, sparing reapeth ay: Sure, a good turn shall never guerdon want; A Gift to Needlings is not given, but lent: T's a Well of Wealth, which doth perpetuall run: A fruitfull Field which thousand yeelds for one. While thus he said, and staid; the Widow glad, Gives to him frankly all the bread she had: She lost not by't: for, all the Famin-while, That rag'd in Tyre, her little Flowr and Oyl Decreased not, yet had she plenty still, For her and hers to feed in time their fill. At length befell fel Death to take-away Her onely Son, and with her Son her Ioy: Shee prayes her Guest, and he implores his God, And stretching him vpon the breath-less Lad, Thus cries aloud: Vouchsafe me, Lord, this boon, Restore this child's soule, which (it seems) too-soon Thou hast bereft: O! let it not be said, That heer for nought I haue so oft been fed: Let not my presence be each-where abhorr'd; Nor Charity with thee to want Reward. As a small seedling of that fruitfull Worm, Which (of it selfe) fine shining Sleaves doth form, By the warm comfort of a Virgin brest, Begins to quicken, creepeth (as the rest) Re-spins a-fresh, and, in her witty loom, Makes of her corps her corps a pretious Toomb: This Childe (no Man, but Man's pale Module now) With death ith' bosom, horror on the brow, The bait of Worms, the Booty of the Beer, At sacred words begins his eye to rear; Swimming in Death, his powrs do re-assemble, His spirits (rewarm'd) with-in his artirs tremble; He fetcht a sigh; then liuely rising too, Talks, walks, and eats, as he was wont to doo. Fain would the Mother haue besought the Seer T'have past the rest of his colde Olde-age heer: But th'holy Spirit him sodain hence doth bring Vnto Samaria to th'incensed King; Who rates him thus: O Basilisk! O Bane! The like Imputation, in our dayes, the blind Popelings and profane Worldlings haue layd vpon the Gospel and the Preachers thereof.Art not thou He that sow'st th'Isaacian Plain With Trouble-Tares? Seditious, hast not thou Profan'd the Laws of our Fore-fathers now? Broken all Orders, and the Altars bann'd Of th'holy Gods, Protectors of our Land? Since thy fond Preaching did heer first begin, More and more heavie hath Heav'ns anger bin Vpon vs all; and Baal, blasphem'd by thee, Hath since that season never left vs free From grievous Plagues: it is a Hell we feel, Our Heav'n is Brass, our Earth is all of Steel. No, no, O King (if I the Truth shall tell) Thou, thou art hee that troublest Israel. Thou (give me leave) thou and thy Grand-sires, mad After strange Gods in every Groue to gad, Have left the true, wise, wondrous (all-abroad) Omnipotent, victorious, glorious God: Such shall you proue him, if you dare oppone All your Baal-Prophets against me, but one. Content, quoth Achab. Then to Carmel's top The Schismik Priests were quickly called vp: Vnto their Baal an Altar build they there; To God, the Prophet doth another rear: Both have their Beasts; and by their prayer must prove Whose God is God, by Fire from Heav'n aboue. The People's eyes, and ears, and mindes are bent Vpon these Maruails, to observe th'euent (Marvails, which might well cleer the difference That had so long depended in suspence 'Twixt Israel and Iuda; and direct Th'Earth how to serue Heav'ns sacred Architect) As when two Buls, inflamed fiercely-fell, Simile. Met front to front, their forked arms do mell, The feeble Heards of Heifers in a maze, Twixt hope and fear, vnfeeding, stand at gaze, To see the Fight, and censure which doe proue The valiantest, that he may be their Loue. Baal's baalling Priests call and cry out for life, Baals Priests. They gash their flesh, with Launcet and with knife, They cruell make their blood to spin about (As Claret wine from a pearç't Peece doth spout) And, madly shaking heads, leggs, sides and arms, They howling chant these Dithyrambik charms; Help, Help, O Baal, O Baal attend our cryes, Baal, heare vs Baal, O Baal, bow downe thine eyes: O Stratian, Clarian, Eleutherian Powrs, Panomphæan God, approve vs thine, thee ours: O Epicarpian! O Epistatirian, Phyxian, Feretrian, O Exacestirian, Xemian, Messapian, O Lebradean Baal, O Assabine, Baal-samen, hear our Call. Elijah, that their bloody Rites abhord, And knowes aright the seruice of the Lord, T'appease his wrath he doth not scarre his skin; Nor with self-wounds presume his grace to win, Nor makes himselfe vnfitting for his function, By selfly stripes (as causing more cumpunction) Nor, thrild with bodkins, raues in frantik-wise, And in a furie seems to prophetize; But offers God his heart, in steed of blood: His speech is sober, and as milde his mood. Ironia.Cry loud, quoth he: your God is yet perchance In a deep sleep, or doth in Arms aduance Against his Foes (th'Egyptian Deïties) Or is consulting how to keep the Flies From off his Altar. But, O Izrael! Alas! why yoakst thou God with Baal (or Bel)? Alas! how long thus wilt thou halt twixt either, And fondly mix Darnel and Wheat together In thy Faith's Field? If Baal be God indeed, Then boldly serue him, seek him sole at need: But, if blew Sea, and winged Firmament, Th'all-bearing Earth, and Storm-breed Element, Be but the least Works of th'Almighty hand Of Iacob's God: If Heav'n, Air, Sea, and Land, And all in all, and all in every one, By his owne finger be sustain'd alone: If he haue cast those cursed Nations out, Which yerst defil'd this fair, fat Land about; To give it thee, to plant thee in their place, Why him alone doost thou not ay imbrace, And serue him onely in thy Soule and Heart, Who in his Love brooks none to share a part? The cord vn-twisted weakens: and who serues Two Lords at-once, to lose them both deserues. Baal dead (thou seest) hears not his Servants call, Much less can grant them their Desires at all: But, Iacob's God, Iehova, Elohim, Never deceives their hope that trust in him. Hear me therefore, O Lord, and from aboue With Sacred Fire (thy Soverain powr to prove) Consume this Bullock, and shewe by the same That thou art God, and I thy Servant am: And to thy Fold (thy Churches Lap) repeal Thy wandring Flock, thy chosen Israel. Simile.As falls a Meteor in a Sommer Even, A sodain Flash coms flaming down from Heav'n, Licks dry the Dikes, and instantly, at-once, Burns all to Ashes, both the Altar-stones, And th'Offered Bullock: and the People fall In zealous fury on the Priests of Baal; And, by Elijah's prayer, soone obtaine Rain, which so often they had askt in vain. For, what is it Elijah cannot do? If he be hungry, Fouls, and Angels too, Becom his Stewards. Fears he th'armed Bands Of a fel Tyrant? from their bloody hands To rescue him, Heav'n (his confederate) Consumes with Fire them and their fierie hate. Or, would he pass a Brook that brooks no Bay, Nor bridge, nor Bank? The Water giues him way. Or, irks him Earth? To Heav'n alive he hies, And (sauing Henoch onely He not-dies. This Man of God, discoursing with his heir Ellijah taken vp aliue into Heaven. Of th'vpper Kingdom, and of Gods Affair, A sodain whirl-winde, with a whiffing Fire, And flaming Chariot rapts him vp intire, Burns not, but 'fines; and doth (in fashion strange) By death-less Death, mortall immortall change. A long-tail'd squib, a flaming ridge, for rut Seems seen a while, where the bright Coach hath cut. This sacred Rape, nigh rapt Elisha too: Who, taking vp his Tutors Mantle, tho, Follows as far as well he could with ey The fire-snort Palfreys, through the sparkling Sky; Crying, My father, father mine fare-well, The Chariots and the Horse of Izrael. The Thisbian Prophet hangs not in the Air, Amid the Meteors to be tossed there, As Mists and Rains, and Hail, and hoarie Plumes, And other Fierie many-formed Fumes: Amid the Air tumultuous Satan roules; And not the Saints, the happy, heav'nly Soules. Nor is he nailed to some shining Wheel, Ixion-like continually to reel; For Christ his flesh, transfigur'd, and divine, Mounted aboue the Arches Crystalline: And where Christ is, from pain and passion free, There (after death) shall all his Chosen bee. Elijah therefore climbs th'Empyreal Pole; Where, ever-blest in body and in soule, Contemns this World, becoms an Angel bright, And doth him firm to the Trine-One vnite. But how, or why should He this vantage haue Yet Christ (right call'd the first-fruits of the Grave)? O happy passage! O sweet, sacred Flight! O blessed Rape! thou raptest so my spright In this Dispute, and mak'st my weaker wit So many wayes to cast-about for it, That (I confess) the more I do contend, I more admire, and less I comprehend. For lack of wings, then biding heer belowe With his Successor, I proceed to showe, How, soon as he took-vp his Cloak (to beare it) Elizeus or Elisha.Within Elisha shin'd Elijah's Spirit; By powr whereof, immediatly he cleaves An vn-couth way through Iordan's rapid waves: Past hope he gives to the Sunamian Wife A Son; and soone restores him dead to life: With sodain blindness smites the Syrian Troup The which in Dothan did him round incoup: Increaseth bread, and of a pound of Oyl Fills all the Vessels in a town that while: His hoary head (in Bethel) laught to scorn, Is veng'd by Bears, on forty children torn: Naaman's cleans'd; and for foul Simonie, Gehazi's punisht with his Leprosie: Mends bitter Broath, he maketh Iron swim As porie Cork, vpon the Water's brim. Rich Iericho's (sometimes) sal-peetry soil, Through brinie springs that did about it boil, Brought forth no fruit, and her vn-holsome Brooks Voyded the Town of Folk, the Fields of Flocks: The Towns-men, therefore, thus besought the Seer; Thou seest our Citie's situation heer Is passing pleasant; but the ground is naught, The Water worse: we pray thee mend the fault, Sweeten our Rivers, make them pleasanter, Our Hills more green, our Plains more fertiler. The Prophet calls but for a Cruse of Salt (O strangest cure!) to cure the brynie fault Of all their Floods; and, casting that in one Foul stinking Spring, heals all their streams anon: Not, for an houre, or for a day, or twain, But to this Day they sweet and sound remain. Their Valley, walled with bald Hills before, But even a horror to behold, of-yore; Is now an Eden, and th'All-circling Sun, For fruitfull beauty, sees no Paragon. There (labour-less) mounts the victorious Palm, There (and but there) growes the all-healing Balm, There ripes the rare cheer-cheek Myrobalan, Minde-gladding Fruit, that can vn-olde a Man. O skilfull Husbands, giue your fattest Plains Five or six earths; spare neither cost nor pains, To water them; rid them of weeds and stones, With Muck and Marle batten and baste their bones; Vnless God bless your Labour and your Land, You plough the Sea, and sowe vpon the sand. This, Iurie knowes; a Soil somtimes (at least) Sole Paradise of all the proudest East: But now the brutest and most barren place, The curse of God, and all the Worlds disgrace: And also Greece, on whom Heav'ns (yerst so good) Rain nothing now but their drad Furie's Flood. The grace of God is a most sure Revenue, A Sea of Wealth, that euer shall continue, A neuer-failing Field, which needs not ay The cool of Night, nor comfort of the Day. What shall I say? This sacred Personage Not only profits to his proper Age; But, after life, life in his bones he leaues, And dead, the dead he raiseth from their graues. Nor is Elisha famous more for Miracles, Than for the Truth of his so often Oracles: He showes the Palms and Foils of Israel, Benhadad's death, the Raign of Hazael: Beyond all hope, and passing all appearance, Deiected Ioram's neer relief he warants. For, now the Syrian, with insulting Powrs, The Siege and Famin of Samaria. So streict besiegeth the Samarian Towrs, That euen all-ready in each nook agrising, Fell, wall-break (all-break) Famine, ill-aduising Howls hideously: euen the bare bones are seen (As sharp as kniues) thorough the empty skin Of the best bred: and each-man seems (almost) No Man indeed but a pale gastly Ghost. Som snatch the bread from their own Babes, that pine; Som eat the Draff that was ordain'd for Swine, Som do defile them with forbidden flesh, Som bite the grass their hunger to refresh; Som, gold for Birds-dung (waight for waight) exchange; Som, of their Boots make them a Banquet strange, Som fry the Hay-dust, and it sauorie finde; Som, Almond-shels and Nut-shels gladly grinde, Som mince their Fathers Wills, in parchment writ, And so deuoure their Birth-right at a bit. The King, when weary he would rest awhile, Dreams of the Dainties he hath had yer-while, Smacks, swallows, grindes both with his teeth and iaws; But, only winde his beguil'd bellie draws: And, then awaking, of his owne spare Diet Robbs his owne brest, to keep his Captains quiet. He is importun'd heer and there about: Aboue the rest, a Woman skrieketh out In mournfull manner, with dissheueled haire; Her face despight, her fashion showes despaire. Mothers eate their own Children.O! stay my Liege, hear, hear a grieuous thing; Iustice, great Ioram, Iustice, gentle King. O, no, not Iustice: (did I Iustice craue?) Fondling, in Iustice, thou canst nothing haue But a iust death; nay, but a Torture fell; Nay, but a Torment, like the pains of Hell. Yet, euen this Plea is worse then death to me: Then grant me Iustice, Iustice let it be. For (O!) what horror can restrain desire Of iust Reuenge, when it is once afire? My Lord, I bargain'd, and (to bind the Pact) By solemn Oath I sealed the Contract; Contract, indeed cruell, yet could not be Infring'd, or broken, without Crueltie. (Tell it O, Tongue: why stay'st thou so vpon-it? Dar'st thou not say-it, hauing dar'd and don-it? Not hauing fear'd Heavens King, how canst thou fear An earthly King?) Then, thus (my Liege) while-yer I, and my Neighbour desperately agreed, Iointly to eate, successiuely, our seed; Our own deer Children: and (O luck-less Lot!) Mine first of all, is destin'd to the Pot: Forth-with I catch-him, and I snatch him to-me Vp in mine arms: he straight begins to woo-me, Stroaks, colls, and huggs me, with his arms and thighes: And, smiling sweet, Mam-mam, mam-mam, he cryes, Then kisses me: and with a thousand toyes, Thinks to delight me with his wonted ioyes. I looke away; and, with my hand addrest, Bury my knife within his tender brest: And, as a Tigresse, or the Dam of Bears, A Fawn or Kid in hundred gobbets tears, I tear him quick, dress him, and on our Table I set him: Oh! ('t is now no time to fable) I taste him first, I first the feast begin, His blood (my blood) runs round about my Chin, My Childe returns, re-breeding in my Womb; And of my Flesh my Flesh is shamefull Tomb: Soon cloyd (alas!) but little could I eat, And vp again that little striues to get. But she, she layes it in, she greedy plyes-it: And all night long she sits to gourmandize-it: Not for her fill so much of such (think I) As to prolong the more my misery: O God, said she (and smiles in eating it) What a sweet morsell! what a dainty bit! Blest be the brest that nurç't such meat for me; But more the Womb that bare it, so to be. So (to be brief) my Son is eat: But hers Aliue and lusty in her arms she bears. Why should her Pittie, rather her despite, Do both her Faith, Me, and my Son, vn-right? Ah! for her belly, rather then her Boy, She playd this prank (and robd me of my Ioy). She did it not, of tender hart to saue him; But, greedy-gut, that she alone might haue him. Therfore, O King, do Iustice in this case: Nor craue I pardon of thy princly grace For mine Offence; (such an Offence, I knowe, As yet grim Minos never iudg'd belowe) For if I should, how should I do, for meat; Not hauing now another Childe to eat? No: this is all I craue before I die, That I may taste but of Her sonnes sweet thigh: Or, that (at least) mine eye, more iust then cruell, May see him slain by her, my Horrors fuell. But, if you waigh not mine vnfained tears (Indeed vn-worthy): yet vouchsafe your ears To the loud Plaints of my lamenting Son; Who, with strange murmurs rumbling vp and down, Seems in my bowels as reviv'd to groan, And to your Highnes, thus to make his moan; Sir, will you suffer, without all reuenge, Mens cursed malice boldly to infringe Law, Faith, and Iustice, Vows, and Oaths, and all, As buzzing Flies tear Cob-webs on a wall? Ah! shall I then descend alone belowe? Dy vn-reueng'd? foster my cruell Foe? And then, cast-forth in foulest Excrement, Infect the Aire, offend the Element; The while her Darling, on his Hobby-horse About the Hall shall ride, and prance, and course; And imitate mens actions (as an Ape), Build paper-Towrs, make Puppets, sit in Lap? No: let him die, let him (as I) be cut, Let him (as I) be in two Bellies put: Full-fill the Pact; that so our wretched Mothers Their Guilt and Grief, may eyther's match with others. The King, less mov'd with pitty than with horror, Thunders these words, raging in threat-full terror; Vengeance and mischief on mine owne head light, If curst Elisha keep his head this night: And, as he spake, forth in a rage he flings, To execute his bloody Threatenings. Sir, said the Prophet, you haue seen the scathe Deuouring Famine heer performed hath; But, by to-morrow this time (God hath said) Samaria's Gates shall euen abound with Bread. Tush, said a Minion of the Court, hard by (Of surly speech, proud gait, and lofty ey) Though God should open all Heav'ns windows wide, It cannot be: Yes, Infidell (reply'd The zealous Prophet) Thou thy Self (in sum) Shalt see it then: but shalt not taste a Crum. Thus said Elisha, and th'Almightie Powr Perform'd his Sayings in the very howr. Her scarlet Robe Aurora had not donn'd, Nor had she yet limn'd the Euphratean strond With trembling shine, neyther was Phœbus yet Willing to wake out of a drouzie Fit, Description and effects of Fear.When pallid Fear, flyes to the Pagan Hoast, Wilde-staring Hag, shiv'ring, and wavering most; She, that her voyce and visage shifts so oft: She that in Counsails striues to lift aloft Irresolution, to be President (Canker of Honor, curse of Gouernment): She that euen trembles in her surest Arms, Starts at a leaf, swouns at report of harms: Beleeues all, sees all; and so swayeth all, That, if she say, the Firmament doth fall: There be three Suns: This, or that Mountain sinks: Paul's Church doth reel, or the foundation shrinks: It is beleeu'd, 't is seen: and, seis'd by Her, The other Sense are as apt to err. Clashing of Arms, Rattling of iron Cars, Murmur of Men (a World of Soldiers) Neighing of Horse, noise of a thousand Drums With dreadfull sound from the next Vale ther coms. The Syrian Camp, conceiuing that the Troups Of Nabathites, Hethits, and Ethyops, Hyr'd by th'Isaacians, came from euery side, To raise their Siege, and to repell their pride; Fly for their liues, disordered and disperst (Amid the Mountains) so well-ordered yerst. One, in his Cap-case leaues-behinde his Treasure: To bridle's horse another hath not leasure; Another, hungry on the grass hath set His Break-fast out, but dares not stay to eat. One thinks him farre, that yet hath little gon: Another weens him in plain ground, anon He breaks his neck into a Pit: another Hearing the Boughs that brush against each other, And doubting it to be the Conquerer, He wretched dies of th'only wound of Fear. As, after tedious and continuall rain, The honey-Flies haste from their Hiues again, Suck heer and there, and bear into their bowr The sweetest sap of euery fragrant flowr: So from besieg'd Samaria each man hies, Vnto the Tents of fear-fled Enemies: Wherein, such store of corn and wine they pill, That in one day their hungry Town they fill: And in the Gate, the Croud, that issueth, Treads th'vnbeleeuing Courtier down to death; So that (at once) euen both effects agree Iust with Elisha's holy prophecie. From this School comes the Prophet Amethite, The twice-born Preacher to the Niniuite. Ionas, be gon: hie, hie thee (said th'Almighty) The Ship-wrack of Ionas. To Ninive, that great and wanton Citie: Cry day and night, cry out vnto them all; Yet forty dayes, and Niniue shall fall. But, 'gainst th'Eternall, Ionas shuts his eare, And ships himself to sail another-where: Wherfore, the Lord (incensed) stretcht his arm, To wrack the wretch in suddain fearfull Storm. Now, Nereus foams, and now the furious waues A liuely Description of the storm at Sea. All topsie-turned by th'Æolian slaues, Do mount and roule: Heav'n Wars against the Waters, And angry Thetis Earth's green bulwarks batters: A sable ayr so muffles-vp the Sky, That the sad Saylers can no light discry: Or, if som beam break through their pitchy night, 'Tis but drad flashing of the Lightning's light. Strike, strike our saile (the Master cries) amain, Vaile misne and sprit-sail: but he cries in vain; For, in his face the blasts so bluster ay, That his Sea-gibberish is straight born away. Confused Cries of men dismay'd in minde, Seas angry noise, lowd bellowing of the winde, Heav'ns Thunder-claps, the tackles whisteling (As strange Musicians) dreadfull descant sing. The Eastern winde driues on the roaring train Of white-blew billows, and the clouds again With fresh Seas crosse the Sea, and she doth send (In counter-change) a rain with salt y-blend. Heav'ns (headlong) seem in Thetis lap to fall, Seas scale the skies, and God to arm this All Against one ship, that skips from stars to ground, From waue to waue (like Balloons windy bound) While the sad Pilot, on a foamy Mount, Thinks from the Pole to see Hells pit profound; And, then, cast down vnto the sandy shole, Seems from lowe Hell to see the loftie Pole: And, feeling foes within and eek without, As many waues, so many deaths doth doubt. The billows, beating round about the ship, Vnchauk her keel, and all her seams vnrip; Whereby the waters, entring vncontroul'd, Ebbing abroad, yet flowe apace in hold: For euery Tun the plied Pump doth rid, A floud breaks in; the Master mastered With dread and danger (threatning euery-way) Doubts where to turn him, what to doo, or say, Which waue to meet, or which salt surge to flie; So yeelds his charge, in Sea to liue or die. Simile.As, many Cannons, 'gainst a Castle bent, Make many holes, and much the rampire rent, And shake the wall, but yet the latest shock Of fire-wingd bullets batters down the Rock: So, many mounts, that muster 'gainst this Sail, With roaring rage do this poor ship assail; But yet the last (with foaming fury swoln, With boistrous blasts of angry tempests boln) Springs the main-mast: the mast with boystrous fall Breaks down the deck, and sore affrights them all. Pale Idol-like, one stands with arms a-cross: One moans himself: one mourns his childrens loss: One, more than Death, this form of Death affrights: Another calls on Heav'ns vn-viewed Lights: One, 'fore his eyes his Ladies looks beholds: Another, thus his deadly fear vnfolds: Curst thirst of gold! O how thou causest care! My bed of Doun I change for hatches bare: Rather than rest, this stormy war I chose: T'enlarge my fields, both land and life I lose: Like peizless plume, born-vp by Boreas breath, With all these wings I soar, to seek my death, To Heav'n and Hell, by angry Neptune led, Where lest I scape it, all these sails I spread. Then thus another: sure no winde (quoth he) Could raise this Storm; som rarer Prodigy Hath caus'd this Chaos (cause of all our grief) Som Atheist dog, som Altar-spoyling theef Lurks in this ship: com (Mates) by lot let's trie (To saue the rest) the man that ought to die. 'T is I. quoth Ionas, I indeed am cause Of this black night, and all the fearfull flaws Of this rough Winter; I must sole appease (By my iust death) these wrath-full wrack-full Seas. Then vp they heave him straight, and from the waste Him suddenly into the Sea they cast. The King of Windes cals home his churlish train, And Amphitrite smooths her front again: Th'Air's cloudy Robe returns to crystall clear, And smiling Heav'ns bright Torches re-appear So soon as Ionas (to them all appease) O'r head and ears was soused in the Seas. Thrice coms hee vp, and thrice again goes down Vnder the waves (yer hee doo wholly drown): But then hee sinks; and, wretched, roul'd along The sands, and Oase, and rocks, and mud among, Thus, thus hee cries with lips of zealous faith; Mercy, my God, shew mercy, Lord (hee saith). Then God (who ever hears his childrens wish) Provided straight a great and mighty Fish, That swilling swallow'd Ionas in her womb; A living Corps laid in a living Toomb. Like as a Roach, or Ruff, or Gudgeon, born Simile. By som swift stream into a weer (forlorn) Frisks to and fro, aloft and vnder dives, Fed with false hope to free their captive lyves: The Prophet so (amazed) walks about This wondrous Fish to finde an issue out, This mighty Fish, of Whale-like huginess, Or bigger-bellied, though in body lesse. Where am I, Lord? (alas!) within what vaults? In what new Hell doost thou correct my faults? Strange punishment! my body thou bereav'st Of mother-earth, which to the dead thou leav'st: Whither thy wrath drives mee, I doo not knowe. I am depriv'd of air, yet breathe and blowe: My sight is good, yet can I see no sky: Wretch, nor in Sea, nor yet a-shore am I: Resting, I run; for, mooving is my Cave: And, quick, I couch within a living Grave. While thus hee plain'd; the third day, on the sand The friendly Fish did cast him safe a-land. And then, as if his weary limbs had been So long refresht, and rested at an Inn, Hee seems to flee; and comn to Ninive, Your sins have reached vp to Heav'n (quoth hee): Wo and alas, wo, wo vnto you all: Yet forty daies, and Ninive shall fall. Thus Ionas preacht: But, soon the Citizens, Sincerely toucht with sense of their foul sins, Dispatch (in haste) to Heav'n, Repentance sad, Sweet-charming Prayer, Fasting hairy-clad. Repentance makes two Torrents of her eies, Her humble brow dares scant behold the skies: Her sobbing breast is beaten blew and black: Her tender flesh rent with rugged sack: Her head (all hoar'd with harty sorrows past) With dust and ashes is all over-cast. Praier's head, and sides, and feet are set about With gawdy wings (like Ioves Arcadian Scout): Her body flaming, from her lips there fumes Nard, Incense, Mummy, and all rich Perfumes. Fasting (though faint) her face with ioy shee cheers, Strong in her weaknes, yong in aged yeers; Quick health's preserver, curbing Cupid's fits, Watchfull, purge-humors, and refining wits. Then Faith (Grand Vsher of th'Empyreall Court) Vshers these Legats by a golden Port Into the Presence, and them face to face Before th'All-Monarch's glorious Throne doth place; Where (zealous) prostrate on her humble knee, Thus Praier speaks in name of all the Three: God, slowe to wrath! O Father, prone to grace! Lord, sheath again thy vengeance-sword a space. If at thy beam of Iustice thou wilt waigh The works of men that wander every day: If thou their metall by that touch-stone try Which fearfull-sounding from thy mouth doth fly: If thou shalt summ their sins (which pass the sand) Before thee, Lord, who shall endure to stand? Not Ninive alone shall perish then; But all this All bee burnt to ashes clean: And even this day shall thy iust wrath prevent The dreadfull Day of thy last Dooms event, This world to Chaos shall again return; And on thine Altars none shall incense burn. O therefore spare (Lord) spare the Ninivites, Forgive their sins; and, in their humbled sprites, From this time forth thy sacred Laws ingrave: Destroy them not, but daign them Lord to save: Look not (alas!) what they have been before; But vs regard, or thine owne mercy more. Then, God reacht out his hand, vnfolds his frowns, Disarms his arm of Thunder bruising-Crowns, Bows graciously his glorious flaming Crest, And mildely grants, in th'instant, their request. The Decay. THE IIII. BOOK OF THE FOVRTH DAY OF THE II. WEEK. The Argvment. Ambitions bitter fruit, fell Achab's Stock, With his proud Queen (a painted Beauty-mock) Extirpt by Iehv: Iehv's ligne likewise Shallum supplants. King-killing Treacheries Succeed a-rowe, with Wrack of Israel. Time-suiting Batts: Athaliah Tigress fell. Ioash well-nurtur'd, natur'd-ill, doth run After his kinde: hee kils his Tutors Son. Zenacherib: life-lengthned Ezechiah: Nabvchadnezar: Captive Zedechiah. Hvff-puft Ambition, Tinder-box of War, Ambition pourtrayed to the life. Down-fall of Angels, Adam's murderer, Parent of Treasons, Reason's Contradiction, Earth's Enemy, and the Heav'ns Malediction, O! how much Blood hath thy respect-less age Shed in the World! showred on every Age! O Scepter's, Throne's, and Crown's insatiat Thirst, How many Treasons hast thou hatched yerst! For, O! what is it that hee dares not doo, Who th'Helm of Empire doth aspire vnto? Hee (to beguile the simple) makes no bone To swear by God (for, hee beleeves there's none); His Sword's his Title; and who scapes the same, Shall have a Pistoll, or a poysony Dram: Hee, fear'd of all, fears all: hee breaks at once The chains of Nature and of Nations: Sick of the Father, his kinde heart is woe The good Old-man travels to Heaven so slowe: His owne dear Babes (yet Cradled, yet in Clouts) Haste but too fast; are at his heels, hee doubts: Hee passeth to his promis'd Happinesse Vpon a Bridge of his Friends Carcases; And mounts (in fine) the golden Throne by stairs Built of the Sculs of his owne Countries heirs. Yet thou permitt'st it, Lord; nay, with thy wings Coverest such Tyrants (even the shame of Kings). But, not for nothing doost thou them forbear; Their cruell scalps a cruell end shall tear: And, when the Measure of their Sin is full, Thy Hands are iron, though thy Feet bee wooll. The Throne of Tyrants totters to and fro: The blood-gain'd Scepter lasts not long (wee knowe): Nail driveth Nail: by tragick deaths device, Ambitious hearts do play at A kinde of Christmas play: wherein each hunteth other from his Seat. The name seems derived from the French levezsus, in English, arise vp. Level sice; Proov'd but too plain in both the Houses Royall Of Iacobs issue, but too-too disloyall: As, if thou further with thy grace divine My Verse and Vows, shall heer appear in time. God Novv no longer could support th'excess Of Achab's House, whose cursed wickednes Was now top-full: and, Dogs already stood Fawning and yawning for their promis'd blood. Heav'ns haste their Work. Now, in tumultuous wise, 'Gainst Achab's Son doo his owne Souldiers rise; Iehu. Iehu's their Captain: who foresees, afar, How-much, dispatch advantageth in War; And, politick, doubles his Armies speed To get before; yea, before Fame, indeed. Ioram, surpriz'd in feeble Bulwarks then (Vnfurnished of Victuals and of Men) And, chiefly, wanting royall fortitude, Vn-kingly yeelds vnto the Multitude. Bould Nimshi's Son, Sir Iehu, what's this Thing? What mean these Troops? what would you of the King? Where shall the bolt of this black Thunder fall? Say, bring'st thou Peace? or bring'st thou War, withall? Sayd Ioram, lowd: but, Iehu lowder saith, No (wretch) no Peace, but bloody Wars and death. Simile.Then fled the King: and (as a Ship at Sea, Hearing the Heav'ns to threaten every way, And Winter-Storms with absent Stars compack, With th'angry Waters to conspire her wrack, Strives not to ride it out, or shift abroad, But plies her Oars, and flees into the Road) Hee ierks his Iades, and makes them scour amain Simile. Through thick and thin, both over Hill and Plain. Which, Iehu spying, and well eying too, As quick resolveth what hee hath to doo; Cries, Boy, my Bowe: then nocks an Arrow right, His left hand meets the head, his brest the right. As bends his Bowe, hee bends; lets go the string: Through the thin air, the winged shaft doth sing King Ioram's Dirge; and, to speed the more, Pearces behinde him, and peeps-out before. The Prince now hurt (that had before no hart) Fals present dead, and with his Courtly-Cart Bruiz'd in the Fall (as had the Thisbite said) The Field of Naboth with his blood beraid: And Salem's King had also there his due, For ioining hands with so profane a Crew. Then, the proud Victor leads his loyall Troops Towards the Court (that all in silence droops); And, more for Self-love, then for God's pure zeal, Means to dispatch, th'Earth's burden, Iezabel. The Queen had inkling: instantly shee sped Iezabel. To curl the Cockles of her new-bought head: The Saphyr, Onyx, Garnet, Diamond, In various forms cut by a curious hand, Hang nimbly dancing in her hair, as spangles: Or as the fresh red-yellow Apple dangles (In Autumn) on the Tree, when too and fro The Boughs are waved with the windes that blowe. The vpper garment of the stately Queen, Her Pride. Is rich gold Tissue, on a ground of green; Where th'art-full shuttle rarely did encheck The Changeable. cangeant colour of a Mallards neck: 'T is figur'd o'r with sundry Flowrs and Fruits, Birds, Beasts, and Insects, creeping Worms, and Neuts, Of Gold-Smiths Work: a fringe of Gold about, With Pearls and Rubies richly-rare set-out, Borders her Robe: and every part discries Cunning and Cost, contending for the prize. Her neat, fit, startups of green Velvet bee, Flourisht with silver; and beneath the knee, Moon-like, indented; butt'ned down the side With Orient Pearls as big as Filberd's pride. But, besides all her sumptuous equipage Her Painting. (Much fitter for her State then for her age) Close in her Closet, with her best Complexions, Shee mends her Faces wrinkle-full defections, Her Cheek shee cherries, and her Ey shee cheers, And fains her (fond) a Wench of fifteen yeers; Whether shee thought to snare the Dukes affection; Or dazle, with her pompous Prides reflexion, His daring eyes (as Fowlers, with a Glass, Make mounting Larks com down to death apace): Or, were it, that in death shee would bee seen (As 'twere) interr'd in Tyrian Pomp, a Queen. A iust Invective against those 2. (predominant) Court Qualities.Chaste Lady-Maids, heer must I speak to you, That with vile Painting spoil your native hue (Not to inflame yonglings with wanton thirst, But to keep fashion with these times accurst) When one new taen in your seem-Beauties snare, That day and night to Hymen makes his Praier, At length espies (as Who is it but spies?) Your painted brests, your painted cheeks and eies, His Cake is dough; God dild you, hee will none; Hee leaves his sute, and thus hee saith anon: What should I doo with such a wanton Wife, Which night and day would cruciate my life With Ieloux pangs? sith every-way shee sets Her borrow'd snares (not her owne hairs) for Nets To catch her Cuckoos; with loose, light Attires, Opens the door vnto all lewd Desires; And, with vile Drugs adultering her Face, Closely allures th'Adulterers Imbrace. But, iudge the best: suppose (saith hee) I finde My Lady Chaste in body and in minde (As sure I think): yet, will shee Mee respect, That dares disgrace th'eternall Architect? That (in her pride) presumes his Work to tax Of imperfection; to amend his tracts, To help the Colours which his hand hath laid, With her frail fingers with foul dirt beraid? Shall I take her that will spend all I have, And all her time, in pranking proudly-brave? How did I doat! the Gold vpon her head, The Lillies of her brests, the Rosie red In either Cheek, and all her other Riches, Wherewith shee bleareth sight, and sense bewitches; Is none of hers: it is but borrow'd stuff, Or stoln, or bought, plain Counterfet in proof: My glorious Idol I did so adore, Is but a Visard, newly varnisht o'r With spauling Rheums, hot Fumes, and Ceruses: Fo, phy; such Poysons one would loath to kiss: I wed (at least, I ween to wed) a Lass Yong, fresh and fair: but, in a yeer (alas!) Or two, at most; my lovely lively Bride Is turn'd a Hag, a Fury by my side; With hollow, yellow teeth (or none perhaps) With stinking breath, swart cheeks, and hanging chaps; With wrinkled neck; and stooping as shee goes, With driveling mouth, and with a sniveling nose. The Queen, thus pranked, proudly gets her vp (But sadly though) to her gilt Palace top; And, spying Iehu, from the window cride: Art thou there, Zimri, cursed Paricide? Fell master-killer, canst thou chuse but fear For like offence, like punishment severe? Bitch, cries the Duke, art Thou there barking still? Thou, Strumpet, Thou art Cause of all this Ill: Thou broughtst Samaria to Thine Idol-Sin: Painting and Pois'ning first Thou broughtest in To Court and Country, with a thousand mo Loose Syrian Vices, which I shame to showe. Thou broughtst-in Wrong, with Rapine and Oppression, By Perjury supplanting Mens possession And life withall: yea, Thou hast been the Baen Of Peers and Seers (at Thy proud pleasure slain): Thou life of Strife, Thou Horse-leach sent from Hell, Thou Drouth, Thou Dearth, Thou Plague of Israel, Now shalt Thou dy: Grooms (is there none for mee?) Quick, cast her down, down, with her instantly. O tickle Faith! O fickle Trust of Court! The perfection of Courtship. These Palace-mice, this busie-idle sort Of fawning Minions, full of sooths and smiles, These Carpet-Knights had vow'd and sworn yer-whiles, Promis'd, protested vnto Iezabel, Rav'd, brav'd and bann'd (like Rodomont in Hell) That in her cause they every Man would dy, And all the World, and Hell and Heav'n defie; Now, Icy Fear (shivering in all their bones) Makes them with Fortune turn their backs at once. They take their Queen between their traiterous hands, And hurl her headlong, as the Duke Commands; Whose Courser, snorting, stamps (in stately scorn) Vpon the Corps that whilom Kings had born: And, to fulfill from point to point the Word Elijah spake (as Legat of the Lord) The doggs about doo greedy feed vpon The rich-perfumed, royall Carrion: And Folk by thousands issuing at the Gate, To see the sight, cry thus (as glad thereat) Ses, ses, heer Dogs, heer Bitches, doo not spare This Bitch that gnaw'd her subiects bones so bare; This cruell Cur, that made you oft becom Saints Torturers, and many a Prophets Tomb: This Whore of Baal, tear her so small, that well No man may say, Heer lieth Iezabel. Iehu's drad Vengeance doth yet farther flowe; Curst Achab's issue hee doth wholly mowe: Hee slaies (moreover) two and forty men Of Ahaziah's hap-less Bretheren: Baal's idoll Clergy hee doth bring to nought, And his proud Temple turns into a Draught: Good proofs of zeal. But yet a Diadem, Desire of Raign, keeps from Ierusalem His service due; content (at home) by halves To worship God vnder the form of Calves. His Son and Nephews track too-neer his trace; And therefore Shallum doth vn-horse his race: The murd'rer Shallum (after one Months Raign) By Manahem as murdrously is slain: The traitor Manahem's wicked-walking Son By traiterous Pekah vnto death is don: And so on Pekah, for Pekaiah's death, Hosheah's treason, treason quittanceth; A proud, ingrate, perfidious, troublous King, That to Confusion did Samaria bring. Their Towns trans-villag'd, the Ten Tribes, transported To a far Clime (whence never they reverted) Soiourn in forrein soil, where Chobar's streams Serve them for Iordan; Basan, Chison seems: While Assur's scorn, and scum of Euphrates Dance vp and down th'Isaacian Palaces, Drink their best Nectars, anchor in their Ports, And lodge profanely in their strongest Forts. But, changing air, these change not minde (in Iury). For, though fierce Lions homicidiall fury Make them retire vndet th'Almighti's wing, Their Country-gods with the true God they ming: They mix his Service, plow with Ass and Ox; Disguise his Church in suits of Flax and Flocks, Cast (in one wedge) Iron and Gold together: Iew-Gentiles, both at-once: but, both is neither. Tale of the Batt.There is a Tale, that once the Hoast of Birds, And all the Legions of Grove-haunting Heards, Before the Earth ambitiously did strive, And counter-plead for the Prerogative: Now, while the Iudge was giving audience, And either side in their seem-Rights defence Was hot and earnest at the noise-full Bar, The neuter Bat stood fluttering still afar: But shee no sooner hears the Sentence past On the Beasts side; but, shuffling her in haste Into their Troop, shee them accompanieth, Showes her large forhead, her long ears, and teeth. The Cause was (after) by Appeal remoov'd To Nature's Court; who by her Doom approov'd The others Plea: then flees the shame-less Bat Among the Birds, and with her Chit-chit-chat Shee seems to sing; and, proud of wings, shee plaies With nimble turns, and flees a thousand waies. Hence, beak-less Bird, hence, winged-Beast, they cride, Hence, plume-less wings (thus, scorn her, either side) Hence, Harlot, hence; this ever bee thy Dole; Be still Day's Prisoner in thy shamefull hole: May neuer Sun (vile Monster) shine on thee: But th'hate of all, for ever, may'st thou be. Such is this People: for, in plentious showrs Application. When God his blessings vpon Isaak powrs, Then are they Isaak's Sons: but, if with thunder Hee wrath-full tear the Hebrue Tree in sunder, These Traytors rake the boughs, and take the Fruit; And (Pagans then) the Iews they persecute. And such are those, whose wily, waxen minde Takes every Seal, and sails with every Winde; Not out of Conscience, but of Carnall Motion, Of Fear, or Favour, Profit, or Poomotion: Those that, to ease their Purse, or please their Prince, Pern their Profession, their Religion mince; Prince-Protestants, Prince-Catholiks; Precise, With Such a Prince; with other, otherwise: Yea, oldest Gangræns of blinde-burning Zeal (As the Kings Evill) a new King can heal. And those Scœne-servers that so lowd have cride 'Gainst Prelats sweeping in their silken Pride, Their wilfull Dumbness, forcing others dumb (To Sion's grievous Loss, and gain of Rome) Their Courting, Sporting, and Non-residence, Their Avarice, their Sloth and Negligence: Till som fat Morsels in their mouthes doo fall; And then, as choakt, and sudden chang'd with-all, Themselves exceed in all of these, much more Than the Right-Reverend whom they taxt before. And those Chamæleons that con-sort their Crew; In Turky, Turks: among the Iews, a Iew: In Spain, as Spain: as Luther, on the Rhine: With Calvin heer: and there with Bellarmine: Loose, with the Lewd: among the gracious, grave: With Saints, a Saint: and among Knaves, a Knave. But all such Neuters, neither hot nor cold, Such double Halters between God and Gold, Such Luke-warm Lovers will the Bride-groom spue Out of his mouth: his mouth hath spoke it true. O Israel, I pity much thy case: This Sea of Mischiefs, which in every place So over-flowes thee, and so domineers; It drowns my soule in griefs, mine eyes in tears: My heart's through-thrilled with your miseries Already past; your Fathers Tragedies. But (O!) I dy; when in the sacred stem Of royall Ivda, in Ierusalem, I see fell Discord, from her loathsom Cage, To blowe her poison with ambitious rage; Sion to swim in blood; and Achab's Daughter Make David's House the Shambles of her Slaughter. Athaliah.Cursed Athaliah (shee was called so) Knowing her Son, by Nimshi's Son, his fo (For Ioram's sake) to bee dispacht; disloyall, On th'holy Mount vsurps the Sceptre Royall: And, fearing lest the Princes of the Blood Would one-day rank her where of right shee should, Shee cuts their throats, hangs, drowns, destroyes them all, Not sparing any, either great or small; No, not the infant in the Cradle, lying Help-less (alas!) and lamentably crying (As if bewailing of his wrongs vn-knowne); No (O extream!) shee spareth not her owne. Simile.Like as a Lion, that hath tutter'd heer A goodly Heifer, there a lusty Steer, There a strong Bull (too-weak for him by half) There a fair Cow, and there a tender Calf; Strouts in his Rage, and wallows in his Prey, And proudly doth his Victory survay; The grass all goary, and the Heard-groom vp Shivering for fear vpon a-Pine-Trees top: So swelleth shee, so growes her proud Despight; Nor Aw, nor Law, nor Faith shee reaks, nor Right. Her Cities are so many Groves of Thieves: Her Court a Stew, where not a chaste-one lives: Her greatest Lords (given all, to all excess) Instead of Prophets, in their Palaces Have Lectures read of Lust and Surfeting, Of Murder, Magik, and Impoisoning. While thus shee builds her tottering Throne vpon Her childrens bones, Iehosheba saves one, One Royall Imp, yong Ioash, from the pile Simile.(As when a Fire hath fiercely rag'd awhile In som fair House, the avaricious Dame Saves som choice Casquet from the furious flame) Hides him, provides him: and, when as the Sun Iehoiada preserueth Ioash. Six times about his larger Ring hath run, Iehoiada, her husband, brings him forth To the chief Captains and the Men of worth; Saying: Behould, O Chiefs of Iuda, see, See heer your Prince, great Davids Progeny, Your rightfull King: if mee you credit light, Beleeve this Face, his Fathers Picture right; Beleeve these Priests, which saw him from the first, Brought to my House, there bred, and fed, and nuç't. In so iust Quarrell, holy Men-at-arms, Imploy (I pray) your anger and your Arms: Plant, in the Royall Plot, this Royall Bud: Venge Obed's blood on strangers guilty blood: Shake-off, with shouts, with Fire and Sword together, This Womans Yoak, this Furie's Bondage, rather. Then shout the People with a common cry, Long live King Ioash; long, and happily: Ioash. God save the King: God save the noble seed Of our true King and ay may They succeed. This news now bruited in the wanton Court, Quickly the Queen coms in a braving sort Towards the Troop; and spying there anon The sweet yong Prince set on a Royall Throne, With Peers attending him on either hand, And strongly guarded by a gallant Band; Ah! Treason, Treason, then shee cries aloud: False Ioyada, disloyall Priest, and proud, Thou shalt abie it: O thou House profane! I'll lay thee levell with the ground again: And thou, yong Princox, Puppet as thou art, Shalt play no longer thy proud Kingling's Part Vpon so rich a stage: but, quickly stript, With wyery Rods thou shalt to death bee whipt; And so, go see thy Brethren, which in Hell Will welcom thee, that badst not them Farwell. But, suddenly the Guard laies hold on her, And drags her forth, as't were a furious Cur, Out of the sacred Temple; and, with scorn, Her wretched corps is mangled, tugg'd and torn. Th'High-Priest, inspired with a holy zeal, In a new League authentikly doth seal Th'obedient People to their bountious Prince; And both, to God; by ioint Obedience. Now, as a Bear-whelp, taken from the Dam, Simile. Is in a while made gentle, meek and tame By witty vsage; but, if once it hap Hee get som Grove, or thorny Mountains top, Then plaies hee Rex; tears, kils, and all consumes, And soon again his savage kinde assumes: So Ioash, while good Ioyada survives, For Piety with holy David strives; But hee once dead, walking his Fathers waies, (Ingrately-false) his Tutors Zachariah. son hee slaies. Him therefore shortly his owne servants slay: His Son, soon after, doth them like repay: His People, him again: then, Amaziah Vzziah fellows, Ioatham Vzziah. Simile.As one same ground indifferently doth breed Both food-fit Wheat and dizzy Darnell seed; Baen-baening Artemisia. Mug-wort, and cold Hemlock too; The fragrant Rose, and the strong-senting Rue: So, from the Noblest Houses oft there springs Som monstrous Princes, and som vertuous Kings; And all-fore-seeing God in the same Line Doth oft the god-less with the godly twine, The more to grace his Saints, and to disgrace Tyrants the more, by their owne proper Race. Ahaz, betwixt his Son and Ioathan (Hee bad, they good) seems a swart Mauritan Betwixt two Adons: Ezekiah, plaç't Between his Father and his Son, is graç't (Hee good they bad) as 'twixt two Thorns, a Rose; Ezekiah.Whereby his Vertue the more vertuous showes. For, in this Prince, great David, the divine, Devout, iust, valiant, seems again to shine. And, as wee see from out the severall Seat Simile.Of th'Asian Princes, self-surnamed Great (As the great Cham, great Turk, great Russian, And if less Great, more glorious Persian) Araxis, Chesel, Volga and many moe Renowned Rivers, Brooks, and Floods, doo flowe, Falling at once into the Caspian Lake, With all their streams his streams so proud to make: The true patern of an excellent Prince.So, all the Vertues of the most and best Of Patriarchs, meet in this Princes brest: Pure in Religion, Wise in Counselling, Stout in Exploiting, Iust in Governing; Vn-puft in Sun-shine, vn-appall'd in Storms (Not, as not feeling, but not fearing Harms) And therefore bravely hee repels the rage Of proudest Tyrants (living in his Age) And (ay vn-danted) in his Gods behalf Hazards at once his Scepter and himself. For, though (for Neighbours) round about him raign Idolaters (that would him gladly gain): Though Godlings, heer of wood, and there of stone, A Brazen heer, and there a Golden one, With Lamps and Tapers, even as bright as Day, On every side would draw his minde astray: Though Assur's Prince had with his Legions fell Forrag'd Samaria, and in Israel Quencht the small Faith that was; and vtterly Dragg'd the Ten Tribes into Captivity, So far, that even the tallest Cedar-Tree In Libanon they never since could see: Yet, Ezechiah serues not Time; nor Fears His Constancy in the seruice of God, &amp; zealous Reformation of all Abuses in the same. The Tyrants fury: nether roars with Bears, Nor howls with Wolues, nor ever turns away: But, godly-wise, well-knowing, that Delay Giues leave to Ill; and Danger still doth wait On lingering, in Matters of such waight; He first of all sets-vp th'Almightie's Throne: And vnder that, then he erects his owne. Th'establishing of Gods pure Law again, Is as the Preface of his happy Raign: The Temple purg'd, th'High-places down he pashes, Fells th'hallowed Groves, burns th'Iol-gods to ashes, Which his owne Father serv'd; and, Zeal-full, brake The Brazen Serpent, Moses yerst did make. For, though it were a very Type of Christ, Though first it were by th'Holy-Gost devis'd, And not by Man (whose bold blinde Fancie's pride Deforms God's Service, strayes on either side, Flatters it self in his Inventions vain, Presumes to school the Sacred Spirit again, Controules the Word, and (in a word) is hot In his owne fashion to serue God, or not) Though the Prescript of Ancient vse defend it, Though Multitude, though Miracles commend it (True Miracles, approved in conclusion, Without all guile of Mens or Fiends illusion) The King yet spares not to destroy the same, When to occasion of Offence it came; But, for th'Abuse of a fond Peoples will, Takes that away which was not selfly ill: Much less permits he (thorough all his Land) One rag, one relique, or one signe to stand Of Idolism, or idle superstition Blindely brought-in, without the Word's Commission. This zealous Hate of all Abhomination, This royall Work of thorough-Reformation, This worthy Action wants not Recompense: God, who his grace by measure doth dispense, Who honours them that truely honour him, To Ezechiah not so much doth seem His sure Defence, and his Confederate: His Quarrel's His, He hates whom him do hate, His Fame He bears about (both far and nigh) On the wide wings of Immortality: To Gath He guideth his victorious Troup, He makes proud Gaza to his Standards stoup, Strong Ascalon he razeth to the ground: And punishing a People wholly drownd In Idolism, and all rebellious Sins, Adds to his Land the Land of Philistins. Yea, furthermore, 'tis He that him withdraws From out the bloudy and ambitious paws Of a fell Tyrant, whose proud bounds extend Past bounds for breadth, and for their length past end; Whose swarms of Arms, insulting every-where, Made All to quake (even at his name) for feare. Already were the Cœlo-Syrian Towrs All sackt, and seized by th'Assyrian Powrs: And, of all Cities where th'Isasians raign'd, Only the great Ierusalem remain'd; Rayling Rabsakeh, in the name of his Master Zenacherib brauing &amp; blaspheming against God and good king Ezekiah.When Rabsakeh, with railing insolence, Thus braues the Hebrewes and vpbraids their Prince (Weening, them all with vaunt-full Threats to snib) Thus saith th'almighty, great Zenacherib: O Salem's Kingling, wherefore art thou shut In these weake walls? is thine affiance put In th'ayd of Egypt? O deceitfull prop! O feeble stay! O hollow-grounded hope! Egypt's a staff of Reed; which, broken soon, Runs through the hand of him that leans ther-on. Perhaps thou trustest in the Lord thy God: What! whom so bold thou hast abus'd so broad, Whom to his face thou daily hast defi'd, Depriv'd of Altars, robd on euery side Of his High Places, hallowed Groves, and all (Where yerst thy Fathers wont on him to call) Whom (to conclude) thou hast exiled quite From every place, and with profane despight (As if condemned to perpetuall dark) Keepst him close-Prisoner in a certain Ark? Will He (can He) take Sion's part and Thine; And with his Foes will He vniustly ioyn? No (wretched) knowe, I haue His Warrant too (Express Commission) what I haue to doo: I am the Scourge of God: 'tis vain to stand Against the powr of my victorious hand: I execute the counsails of the Lord: I prosecute his Vengeance on th'abhorr'd Profaners of his Temples: and, if He Have any Powr, 'tis all conferr'd to me. Yield therefore, Ezechia, yield; and waigh Who I am; who Thou art: and by delay Blowe not the Fire which shall consume thee quite, And vtterly counfound the Israelite. Alas! poor People, I lament your hap: This lewd Impostor doth but puff you vp With addle hope, and idle confidence (In a delusion) of your God's Defence. Which of the Gods, against my Powr could stand, Or save their Citties from my mightier hand? Where's Hamath's God? Where's Arpad's God becom? Where Sephervaim's God? and where (in summ Where are the Gods of Heva, and Ivah too? Haue I not Conquer'd all? So will I doo You and your God; and I will lead you all Into Assyria, in perpetuall Thrall: I'll haue your Manna, and your Aron's Rod, I'll haue the Ark of your Almighty God, All richly furnisht, and new furbisht o'r, To hang among a hundred Tropheis more: And your great God shall in the Roule be read Among the Gods that I haue Conquered: I'll haue it so, it must, it shall be thus, And worse then so except you yeeld to vs. Scarce had he done, when Ezechias, gor'd With blasphemies so spewd against the Lord, Hies to the Temple, tears his purple weed, And fals to Prayer, as sure hold at need. O King of All, but Ours, especially; Ah! sleep'st thou Lord? What boots it, that thine ey Prayer, The Refuge of the Godly:. Pearceth to Hell, and even from Heaven beholds The dumbest Thoughtes in our hearts in-most folds, If thou percçeiv'st not this proud Chalenger. Nor hearst the Barking of this foul-mouth'd Cur? Not against vs so much his Threats are meant, As against Thee: his Blasphemies are bent Against Thy Greatnes; whom he (proudly-rude) Yoaks with the Godlings which he hath subdew'd. Tis true indeed hee is a mighty Prince, Whose numbrous Arms, with furious insolence, Haue ouer-born as many as with-stood, Made many a Province even to swim in blood, Burnt many a Temple; and (insatiate still) Of neighbour Gods haue wholly had their will. But, O! What Gods are those? Gods void of Beeing (Saue, by their hands that serue them) Gods vn-seeing, New, vp-start Gods, of yester-dayes device; To Men indebted, for their Deities: Gods made with hands, Gods without life, or breath; Gods, which the Rust, Fire, Hammer conquereth. But, thou art Lord, th'invincible alone, Th'All-seeing God, the Everlasting One: And, whoso dares him 'gainst thy Powr oppose, Seems as a Puff which roaring Boreas blowes, Weening to tear the Alps off at the Foot, Or Clowds-prop Athos from his massie Root: Who but mis-speaks of thee, he spets at Heav'n, And his owne spettle in his face is driven. Lord shew thee such: take on thee the Defence Of thine owne glory, and our innocence: Cleer thine owne name, of blame: let him not thus Tryumph of Thee, in tryumphing of vs: But, let ther (Lord) vnto thy Church appear Iust Cause of Ioy, and to thy Foes of fear. Miraculous slaughter of the Assyrianst.God hears his Cry, and (from th'Empyreal Round) He wrathfull sends a winged Champion down; Who, richly arm'd in more than humane Arms, Moawes in one night of Heathen men at Arms Thrice-three-score thousand, and five thousand more, Feld round about; beside, behinde, before. Simile.Heer, his two eyes, which Sun-like brightly turn, Two armed Squadrons in a moment burn: Not much vnlike vnto a fire in stubble, Which, sodain spreading, still the flame doth double, And with quick succour of som Southren blasts Crick-crackling quickly all the Country wastes. Heer the stiff Storm, that from his mouth he blowes, Thousands of Souldiers each on other throwes: Simile.Even as a Winde, a Rock, a sodain Flood Bears down the Trees in a side-hanging Wood; Th'Yew over-turns the Pine, the Pine the Elm, The Elm the Oak, th'Oak doth the Ash ore-whelm; And from the top, down to the Vale belowe, The Mount's dis-mantled and even shamed, so. Heer, with a Sword (such as that sacred blade For the bright Guard of Eden's entry made) He hacks, he heaws; and somtimes with one blowe A Regiment hee all at once doth mowe: Simile.And, as a Cannon's thundrie roaring Ball, Battering one Turret shakes the next withall, And oft in Armies (as by proof they finde) Kils oldest Souldiers with his very winde: The whiffing Flashes of this Sword so quick, Strikes dead a many, which it did not strike. Heer, with his hands he strangles all at-once Legions of foes. O Arm that Kings dis-throans! O Army-shaving Sword! Rock-razing Hands! World-tossing Tempest! All-consuming Brands! O, let som other (with more sacred fire, Than I, inflam'd) into my Muse inspire The wondrous manner of this Overthrowe, The which (alas!) God knowes, I little knowe: I but admire it in confused sort; Conceiue I cannot; and, much less, report. Come-on, Zenacherib: where's now thine Hoast? Where are thy Champions? Thou didst lately boast, Th'hadst in thy Camp as many Soldiers, As Sea hath Fishes, or the Heav'ns haue Stars: Now, th'art alone: and yet, not all alone; Feare and Despaire, and Fury wait vpon Thy shame-full Flight: but, bloody Butcher, stay: Stay, noysom Plague, fly not so fast away, Feare not Heav'ns Fauchin: that foul brest of thine Shall not be honor'd with such wounds divine: Nor shalt thou yet in timely bed decease; No: Tyrants vse not to Depart in Peace: As bloud they thirsted, they are drown'd in blood; Their cruell Life a cruell Death makes good. For (O iust Iudgement!) lo, thy Sons (yer-long) Zenacherib slain by his owne sonnes. At Nisroch's Shrine revenge the Hebrews wrong: Yea, thine owne Sons (foul eggs of fouler Bird) Kill their owne Father, sheath their either sword In thine owne throat; and, heirs of all thy vices, Mix thine owne blood among thy Sacrifices. This Miracle is shortly seconded Ezekiah's sicknesse. By one as famous and as strange, indeed. It pleas'd the Lord with heavy hand to smight King Ezechiah; who in dolefull plight Vpon his bed lies vexed grieuously, Sick of an Vlcer past all remedy. Art failes the Leach, and issue faileth Art, Each of the Courtiers sadly wailes a-part His losse and Lord: Death, in a mourn full sort, Through euery Chamber daunteth all the Court; And, in the City, seems in every Hall T'haue light a Taper for his Funerall. Then Amos The Prophet Isaiah. Son, his bed approaching, pours From plentious lips these sweet and golden showrs; But that I knowe, you knowe the Lawes Diuine, But that your Faith so every-where doth shine, But that your Courage so confirm'd I see; A comfortable Visitation of the sicke.I should, my Liege, I should not speake so free: I would not tell you, that incontinent You must prepare to make your Testament: That your Disease shall haue the vpper hand: And Death already at your Door doth stand. What? fears my Lord? Knowe you not heer beneath We alwayes sayl towards the Port of Death; Where, who first anch'reth, first is glorified? That 't is Decreed, confirm'd, and ratified, That (of necessity) the fatall Cup, Once, all of vs must (in our turn) drink vp? That Death's no pain, but of all pains the end, The Gate of Heav'n, and Ladder to ascend? That Death's the death of all our storms and strife, And sweet beginning of immortall Life? For, by one death a thousand death's we slay: There-by, we rise from body-Toomb of Clay. There-by, our Soules feast with celestiall food, There-by, we com to th'heav'nly Brother-hood, There-by, w'are chang'd to Angels of the Light, And, face to face, behould Gods beauties bright. The Prophet ceast: and soon th'Isaacian Prince, Deep apprehending Death's drad form and sense, Vnto the Wall-ward turns his weeping eyes: And, sorow-torn, thus (to himself) he cries: A Prayer for a sick person, mutatis mutandis.Lord, I appeal, Lord (as thine humble childe) From thy iust Iustice to thy Mercy milde: Why will thy strength destroy a silly-one, Weakned and wasted even to skin and bone; One that adores thee with sincere affection, The wrack of Idols, and the Saints protection? O! shall the Good thy servant had begun For Sion, rest now by his death vndon? O! shall a Pagan After-king restore The Groues and Idols I haue raz'd before? Shall I dye Childeless? Shall thine Heritage In vain exspect that glorious golden Age Vnder thy Christ? O! mercy, mercy, Lord: O Father milde, to thy dear Childe accord Som space of life: O! let not, Lord, the voice Of Infidels at my poor death reioyce. The Kings praier heard, and his life prolonged 15 years.Then said the Seer; Be of geed cheer, my Liege: Thy sighes and tears and prayers so besiege The throne of Pitty, that, as pearç't with-all, Thy smiling Health God yieldeth to re-call, Wills, to his Temple (three dayes hence) thou mount, Retracts his Sentence, and corrects his count, Makes Death go back, for fifteen yeers: as lo, This Dial's shadow shal heer back-ward go. His Word's confirm'd with wonderfull Effect: The Sun goes backe. For, lo, the Dial, which doth houres direct (Life's-guider, Daye's-divider, Sun's-Consorter, Shadow's dull shifter, and Time's dumb Reporter) Puts-vp-again his passed Hours (perforce) And back-ward goes against his wonted course. 'Tis Noon at Mid-night; and a triple Morn Seems that long day to brandish and adorn: Sol goes, and coms; and, yer that in the Deep Of Atlas shade he lay him down to sleep, His bright, Light-winged, Gold-shod wheels do cut Three times together in the self-same rut. Lord! what are We! or, what is our deseruing! That, to confirm our Faith (so prone to swarving) Thou daign'st to shake Heav'ns solid Orbs so bright; Th'Order of Nature to dis-order quight? To make the Sun's Teem with a swift slowe pase, Back, back to trot; and not their wonted Race? That, to dispell the Night so blindely-black, Which siels our Soules, thou mak'st the shade go back On Ahaz Dial? And, as Self-vn-stable, Seem'st to revoke thine Acts irrevocable, Raze thine owne Dooms (tost in vn-steddy storm) And, to reforme vs, thine owne speech reform; To giue thy Self the Ly: and (in a Word) As Self-blam'd, softly to put-vp thy Sword? Thrice-glorious God! thrice great! thrice-gratious! Heer-in (O Lord) thou seem'st to deal with vs, Simile. As a wise Father, who with tender hand Severely shaking the correcting Wand, With voice and gesture seems his Son to threat: Whom yet indeed he doth not mean to beat; But, by this curb of fained Rigor, aims To aw his Son: and so him oft reclaims. This Prince no sooner home to Heav'n returns, But Israël back to his vomit turns; Him re-bemires: and, like a head-strong Colt, Runs headlong down into a strange Revolt. And, though Iosias, Heav'n-deer Prince (who yong Coms wisely-olde, to liue the older long) Had re-aduanc't the sacred Lawes divine, Propt Sion's Wall (all ready to decline) With his owne back; and, in his happy Raign, The Truth re-flowr'n, as in her Prime again: Yet Iacob's Heirs striue to resemble still A stiff-throw'n Bowl, which running down a Hill, Simile. Meets in the way som stub, for rub, that stops The speed a space; but instantly it hops, It ouer-iumps; and stayes not, though it stumble, Till to the bottom vp-side-down it tumble. Nebuchadnezzar besiegeth Ierusalem.With puissant Hoast proud Nebuchadnezzar Now threatned Iuda with the worst of War: His Camp coms marching to Ierusalem, And her olde Walls in a new Wall doth hem. The busie Builders of this newer Fold, In one hand, Swords, in th'other Trowels hold, Nor selder strikes with blades than hammers there; With firmer foot the Sieged's shock to beare, Who seem a swarm of Hornets buzzing out Among their Foes, and humming round about To spet their spight against their Enemies, With poysorsie Darts, in noses, brows and eyes. Cold Capricorn hath pav'd all Iuda twice With brittle plates of crystal-crusted Ice, Twice glased Iordan; and the Sappy-blood Of Trees hath twice re-perriwigd the Wood, Since the first Siege: What? sayd the yonger sort, Shall we growe old, about a feeble Fort? Shall we (not Martial, but more Maçon-skild) Shall we not batter Towrs, but rather build? And while the Hebrew in his sumptuous Chamber Disports himself, perfum'd with Nard and Amber, Shall We, swelting for Heat, shivering for Cold, Heer, far from home, lie in a stinking Hold? Shall time destroy vs? shall our proper sloath Annoy vs more than th'Hebrews valour doth? No, no, my Lord: let not our Fervour fault, Through length of Siege; but let vs to th'Assault. Let's win 't and wear it: tut (Sir) nothing is Impossible to Chaldean courages. Contented, said the King: braue Blouds away, Goe seek Renown, 'mid wounds and death, to-day. Now, in their breasts, braue Honor's Thirst began: Nabuzaradan.Me thinks, I see stout Nabuzaradan Already trooping the most resolute Of every Band, this plot to prosecute. Each hath his Ladder; and, the Town to take, Bears to the Wall his Way vpon his back: But, the braue Prince cleaves quicker then the rest His slender Firr-poles, as more prowes-full prest. Alike they mount, affronting Death together; But, not alike in face, nor fortune neither: A Scalado.This Ladder, slippery plaç't, doth slide from vnder: That, over-sloap, snaps in the midst asunder; And soldiers, falling, one another kill (As with his weight, a hollow Rocky-Hill, Simile. Torn with some Torrent, or Tempestuous windes, Shivers it self on stones it vnder-grindes): Som, rashly climb'd (not wont to climb so high) With giddy brains, swim headlong down the Sky: Som, over-whelmd vnder a Mill-stone-storm, Lose, with their life, their living bodies form. Yet mounts the Captain, and his spacious Targe Bears-off a Mountain and a Forest large Of Stones and Darts, that fly about his ears; His teeth do gnash, he threats, he sweats, and swears: As steady there, as on the ground, he goes; And there, though weary, he affronts his Foes, Alone; and halfly-hanging in the ayr, Against whole Squadrons standing firmly fair: Vpright he rears him, and his Helmet braue (Where, not a Plume, but a huge Tree doth wave) Reflecting bright, above the Paripet, Affrights th'whole Citty with the shade of it. Then as half Victor, and about to venter Over the Wall, and ready even to enter; With his bright Gantlet's scaly fingers bent Grasping the coping of the battlement, His hold doth fail, the stones, vn-fastned, fall Down in the Ditch, and (headlong) he with-all: Yet, he escapes, and getts again to shoar; Thanks to his strength: but, to his courage more. Now heer (me thinks) I hear proud Nergal raue: Nergal. In War (quoth he) Master or Match to haue, By Mars I scorn; ye, Mars himself in Arms; And all the Gods, with all their brauing Storms. O wrathfull Heav'ns, roar, lighten, thunder threat; Gods, do your worst; with all your batteries beat: If I begin, in spight of all your powrs I'll scale your Walls, I'll take your Crystall Towrs. Thus spewd the Curr; and (as he spake withal Climbs-vp the steepest of a dreadfull Wall, With his bare-feet on roughest places sprawling, With hook-crookt hands vpon the smoothest crawling. As a fell Serpent, which som Shepheard-lad Simile. On a steep Rock incounters gladly-sad, Turning and winding nimbly to and fro, With wriggling pase doth still approach his Foe, And with a Hiss, a Frisk, and flashing ey, Makes sodainly his faint Assailer fly: Even so the Duke, with his fierce countenance, His thundring-voice, his helms bright radiance, Drives Pashur from the Walls and Iucal too (A iolly Prater, but a Iade to doo; Brauer in Counsail then in Combat, far) With Sephatiah, tinder of this War; And Malchy, he that doth in Prison keep Vnder the ground (a hundred cubits deep) Good Ieremie, an instrument, alone Inspir'd with breath of th'ever-living One. Let's fly, cries Pashur: fly this Infidell, Rather this Fiend, the which no waight can fell. What force can front, or who incounter can An armed Faulcon, or a flying Man? While Nergal speeds his Victory too-fast, His hooks dis-pointed disappoint his haste; Prevent him, not of praise, but of the Prize Which (out of doubt) he did his owne surmize. He swears end tears: (what should? what could he more)? He cannot vp, nor will he down, therefore. Vnfortunate! and vainly-valiant! Simile.He's fain to stand like the Funambulant Who seems to tread the air, and fall he must, Save his Self's waight him counter-poyseth iust; And saue the Lead, that in each hand he bears, Doth make him light: the gaping Vulgar fears, Amaz'd to see him; weening nothing stranger Than Art to master Nature, lucre danger. At last, though loath (full of despight and rage) He slideth down into a horrid hedge, Cursing and banning all the Gods; more mad For the disgrace, than for the hurt he had. Mines &amp; Co?termines.Els-where the while (as imitating right The Kinde-blinde Beast, in russet Velvet dight) Covertly marching in the Dark by day, Samgarnebo seeks vnder ground his way. But Ebedmelech, warn'd of his Designes, With-in the Town against him counter-mines Courageously, and still proceedeth on, Till (resolute) he bring both Works to one; Till one strict Berrie, till one winding Cave Becom the Fight-Field of two Armies brave. As the selfe-swelling Badgerd, at the bay Simile.With boldest Hounds (inured to that Fray) First at the entry of his Burrow fights, Then in his Earth; and either other bites: The eager Dogs are cheer'd with claps and cryes: The angry Beast to his best chamber flies, And (angled there) sits grimly inter-gerning; And all the Earth rings with the Terryes yearning: So fare these Miners; whom I pitty must, That their bright Valour should so darkly ioust. While hotly thus they skirmish in the Vault, Quick Ebedmelech closely hither brought A Dry-Fat, sheath'd in latton plates with-out, With-in with Feathers fill'd, and round about Bor'd full of holes (with hollow pipes of brass) Save at one end, where nothing out should pass; Which (having first his Iewish Troops retir'd; Iust in the mouth of th'enter-Mine he fir'd: The smoak whereof with odious stink doth make The Pagans soon their hollow Fort forsake: As from the Berries in the Winter's night The Keeper drawes his Ferret (flesht to bite). Simile. Now Rabshakeh (as busie) other-where A rowling Towr against the Town doth rear, And on the top (or highest stage) of it A flying Bridge, to reach the Courtin fit, With pullies, poles; and planked Battlements On every story, for his Men's defence. On th'other side, the Towns-men are not slowe With counter-plots to counter-push their Foe: Now, at the wooden side, then at the front, Then at the Engins of the Persian Mount, With Brakes and Slings, and Instruments of Warr wherin wild fire is put. Phalariks they play, To fire their Fortress and their Men to slay: But yet, a Cord-Mat (stifly stretcht about) Defends the Towr, and keeps their Tempests out. While thus they deale; Sephtiah, desperat, Him secretly out of the Citty gat, And with a Pole of rozen-weeping Fir, So furiously he doth himself bestir, That with the same the walking Fort he fires: The cruel flame so to the top aspires, That (maugre Blood, shed from aboue in slaughter, And, from belowe, continuall spouting Water) It parts the Fray: stage after stage it catches, And th'half-broyld Soldiers headlong down it fetches. The King (still constant against all extreames) To press them neerer yet, with mighty beams Rears a new Plat-form, neerer to the Wall, And couers it, with three-fold shelter, all; The Timber (first) with Mud, the Mud with Hides, The Hides with Woll-sacks (which all Shot derides). As th'Aier exhaled by the fiery breath Simile. Of th'Heav'nly Lion, on an open Heath, Or on the tresses of a tufted Plain, Pours-down at-once both Fier and Hail and Rain: So all at once the Isaacian Soldiers threw Floods, Flames and Mountains on these Engines new: But th'hungry Flames the Muddy-damp repels; The Mounts, the Wooll; the drowning Floods, the Fels. There-vnder (safe) the Ram with iron horn, The brazen-headed clov'n-foot Capricorn, The boisterous Trepane, and steel Pick-ax play Their parts apace, not idle night nor day. Heer, thorough-riv'n from top to toe, the Wall On reeling props hangs ready ev'n to fall: There, a vast-Engine thundereth vpside-down The feeble Courtin of the sacred Town. Simile.If you haue been, where, you haue seen som-whiles, How with the Ram they driue-in mighty Piles In Dover Peer, to bridle with a Bay The Sand-cast Current of the raging Sea; Swift-ebbing streams bear to the Sea the sownd, Eccho assisteth, and with shrill rebound Fils all the Town, and (as at Heav'nly Thunder) The Coast about trembles for fear and wonder; Then haue you heard and seen the Engins beating On Sion's Walls, and her foundations threatning. In fine, the Chaldeis take Ierusalem, And reave for ever Iuries Diadem. The smoaky burning of her Turrets steep Seems even to make the Sunn's bright ey to weep: And wretched Salem, buried (as it were) Vnder a heap of her owne Children dear, For lack of Friends to keep her Obsequies, Constraineth sighs (even) from her Enemies: Her massie Ruins and her Cinders showe Her Wealth and Greatnes yer her overthrowe. A sodain horror seizeth every eye That views the same: and every Passer-by (Yea, were he Gete, or Turk, or Troglodite) Must needs, for pitty of so sad a Sight, Bestowe som tears, som swelling sighs, or grones Vpon these batter'd sculs, these scatter'd stones. In Palaces, where lately (gilded rich) Sweet Lutes were heard, now luck-less Oules doo screech: The sacred Temple, held (of late) alone Wonder of Wonders, now a heap of stone: The House of God (the Holiest-Holy-Place) Is now the House of Vermin vile and base: The Vessels, destin'd vnto sacred vse, Are now profan'd in Riot and Abuse: None scapeth wounds, if any scape with life: The Father's reft of Son, the Man of Wife: Iacob's exil'd, Iuda's no more in Iury, But (wretched) sighes vnder the Caldean fury. Their King in chains, with shame and sorrow thrill'd; Hoshea. Before his face sees all the fairest pill'd; Yea, his owne Daughters, and his Wives (alas!) (Rich Vines and Oliues of his lawfull Race) Whose loue and beauty did his age delight, Shar'd to the Souldiers, rauisht in his sight. O, Father, Father, thus the Daughters cry (About his neck still hanging tenderly) Whither (alas!) O, whither hale they vs? O, must we serue their base and beastly Lusts? Shall they dissolue our Virgin-zones? Shall they (Ignoble Grooms) gather our Mayden-May, Our spot-less Flowr, so carefully preserv'd For som great Prince, that mought haue vs deseru'd? O Hony-dropping Hills we yerst frequented, O Milk-full Vales, with hundred Brooks indented, Delicious Gardens of deer Israel; Hills, Gardens, Vales, we bid you all fare-well: We (will-we-nill-we) hurried hence, as slaues, Must now, for Cedron, sip of Tygris waues; And (weaned from our natiue Earth and Air) For Hackney-Iades be sould in every Fayr; And (O hearts horror!) see the shame-less Foe Forcing our Honours, triumph in our woe. All-sundring Sword! and (O!) all-cindring Fire! Which (mercy-less) do Sion's Wrack conspire, Why spare you vs, more cruell (cry'd the Wives) In leaving ours, then reaving other's lives? Your Pitie's pity-less, your Pardon Torture: For, quick dispatch had made our Sorrows shorter; But your seem-Favour, that prolongs our breath, Makes vs, aliue, to die a thousand Deaths. For, O deer Husband, deerest Lord, can we, Can we survive, absented quite from Thee, And slaues to those whose Talk is nothing els But thy Disgrace, thy Gyves, and Israels? Can we (alas!) exchange thy Royall bed (With cunning-cost rare-richly furnished) For th'vgly Cabbin and the louzie Couch Of som base Buffon, or som beastly Slouch? Can we, alas! can wretched we (I say) We, whose Commands whole Kingdoms did obay, We, at whose beck even Princes knees did bend, We, on whose Train there dayly did attend Hundreds of Eunuchs, and of Maids of Honour (Kneeling about vs in the humblest manner) To dress vs neat, and duly every Morn In Silk and Gold our Bodies to adorn; Dress others now? work, on disgrace-full frame (Weeping the while) our Sion's wo-full flame? Dragging like Moyls? drudge in their Mills? and hold, Brooms in our hands, for Sceptre-Rods of gold? Com, Parrats, com, y'haue prated, now enough (The Pagans cry in their insulting ruff) On Chalde shoars you shal go sigh your fill, You must with vs to Babel: there at will You may bewail: there, this shall be your plight, Our Mayds by day, our Bed-fellows by night. And, as they spake, the shame-less lust-full crew With furious force the tender Ladies drew Even from between th'arms of the woefull King, Them haling rough, and rudely hurrying; And little lackt the act of most despight, Ev'n in their Father's and their Husbands sight, Who, his hard Fortune doth in vaine accuse, In vain he raves, in vain he roars and rews: Even as a Lion, prisoned in his grate, Whose ready dinner is bereft of late, Roars hideously; but his fell Fury-storm May well breed horror, but it brings no harm. The proud fell Pagans doo yet farther pass: They kill, they tear, before the Father's face (The more to gore: what Marble but would bleed?) They massacre his miserable seed. O! said the Prince, can you less pitious be To these Self-yeelders (prostrate at your knee) Than sternly-valiant to the stubborn-stout That 'gainst your rage courageously stood-out? Alas! what haue they don? what could they doo To vrge reuenge and kindle wrath in you? Poore silly Babes vnder the Nources wing, Haue they conspir'd against the Chaldean King? Haue these sweet Infants, that yet cannot speak, Broak faith with you? Haue these, so yong and weak, Yet in their Cradle, in their Clouts, bewayling Their Woes to-com (to all Man-kinde, vnfayling) Dis-ray'd your Ranks? Haue these that yet doo craul Vpon all fowre, and cannot stand, at all, With-stood your Fury, and repulst your Powrs, Frust'red your Rams, fiered your flying Towrs? And, bravely sallying in your face (almost) Hew'n-out their passage thorough all your Hoast? O! no Chaldeans, only I did all: I did complot the King of Babels fall: I foyld your Troups: I filld your sacred Flood With Caldean bodies, dy'd it with your blood. Turn therfore, turn your bloody Blades on-me; O! let these harm-less Little-ones goe free; And stain not with the Blood of Innocents Th'immortall Tropheis of your high Attents. So, ever may the Riphean Mountains quake Vnder your feet: so ever may you make South, East, and West your owne: on every Coast So, ay victorious march your glorious Hoast: So, to your Wiues be you thrice welcom home, And so God bless your lawfull-loved womb With Self-like Babes, your substance with increase, Your selues (at home) with hoary haires in Peace. But as a Rock, against which the Heav'ns do thunder, Simile. Th'Aire roars about, the Ocean rageth vnder, Yields not a iot: no more this savage Crew; But rather, muse to find-out Tortures new. Heer, in (his sight) these cruell Lestrigons Between them take the eldest of his Sons, With keenest swords his trembling flesh they heaw, One gobbet heer, another there they streaw. And from the veins of dead-lyve limbs, alas!) The spirit-full blood spins in his Fathers's face. There, by the heels his second Son they take, And dash his head against a Chimnies back; The scull is pasht in peeces, like a Crock, Or earthen Stean, against a stony Rock: The scatterd batterd Brains about besmeard, Som hang (O horror!) in the Fathers beard. Last on himselfe their savage fury flyes, And with sharp bodkins bore they out his eyes: The Sun he loses, and an end-less night Beclowds for euer his twin-balled sight: He sees no more, but feels the woes he bears; And now for crystall, weeps he crimsin tears, For, so God would (and iustly too, no doubt) That he which had in Iuda clean put-out Th'immortall Lamp of all religious light, Should have his eyes put-out, should lose his sight; And that his body should be outward blinde, As inwardly (in holy things) his minde. O Butchers (said he) satiat your Thirst, Swill, swill your fill of Blood, vntill you burst: O! broach me not with bodkin, but with knife; O! reaue me not my bodie's light, but life: Giue me the sight not of the Earth, but Skies: Pull-out my heart: O! poach not out mine eyes. Why did you not this barbarous deed dispatch, Yet I had seen me an vnsceptred Wretch, My Citties sackt, my wealthy subiects pild, My Daughters rauisht, and my Sonns all kild? Or else, why stayd you not till I had seen Your (Beast-like) Master grazing on the Green: The Medes conspiring to supplant your Throne: And Babel's glory vtter ouerthrowne? Then had my soule with Fellow-Falls bin eas'd: And then your pain, my pain had part appeas'd. O ragefull Tyrants! moody Monsters, see, See heer my Case; and see your selues in me. Beware Contempt: tempt not the Heav'nly Powrs, Who thunder-down the high-aspiring Towrs (But mildely pardon, and permit secure Poor Cottages that lie belowe obscure) Who Pride abhor; who lift vs vp so high, To let vs fall with greater infamy. Th'Almighty sports him with our Crowns and vs; Our glorie stands so fickle-founded thus On slippery wheels, alreadie rowling down: He gives vs not, but only shewes the Crown: Our Wealth, our Pleasure, and our Honour too (Whereat the Vulgar make so much a-doo) Our Pomp, our State, our All that can be spoken, Seems as a glass, bright-shining, but soon broken. Thrice-happy He, whom with his sacred arm, Th'Eternall props against all Haps of Harm; Who hangs vpon his prouidence alone, And more preferrs God's Kingdom than his owne. So happy be great BRITANNE Kings (I pray) Our Soueraigne Iames, and all his Seed for ay; Our hope-full Henry, and a hundred me Good, faithfull Stvarts (in successiue rowe) Religious, righteous, learned, valiant, wise, Sincere to Vertue, and seuere to Vice; That not alone These dayes of Ours may shine In Zeal-full Knowledge of the Trvth divine, And We (illightned with her sacred rayes) May walk directly in the Saving wayes Of faith-full Seruice to the One true Deitie, And mutuall Practice of all Christian Pietie; But, that our Nephews, and their Nephews (till Time be no more) may be conducted still By the same Cloud by day, and Fire by night (Through this vast Desart of the World's despight) Towards their Home, the heav'nly Canaan, Prepared for vs yer the World began: That they with vs, and we (complete) with them, May meet triumphant in Iervsalem; With-in whose Pearly Gates and Iasper Walls (Where, th'Holy Lamb keeps his high Nuptialls, Where needs no shining of the Sunn or Moon; For, God's owne face makes there perpetuall Noon: Where shall no more be Waylings, Woes, nor Cryes; For, God shall wipe all tears from weeping eyes) Shall enter nothing filthy or vnclean; No Hog, no Dog no Sodomit obscœne, No Witch no Wanton, no Idolater, No Theef, no Drunkeard, no Adulterer, No Wicked-liuer, neither wilfull Lyer: These are without, in Tophet's end-less Fier. Yet such as these (or som of these, at least) We all haue been: in som-what all haue mist (And, had we broken but one Precept sole, The Law reputes vs guilty of the whole): But, we are washed, in the Sacred-Flood; But, we are purged, with the Sprinkled-Blood; But, by the Spirit, we now are sanctify'd; And, through the Faith in Iesvs, iustify'd. Therefore no more let vs our selues defile, No more return vnto our Vomit vile, No more profane vs with Concupiscence, Nor spot the garment of our Innocence: But, constant in our Hope, feruent in Love (As even al-ready conuersant Aboue) Proceed we cheerely in our Pilgrimage Towards our happy promis'd Hæritage, Towards That Citty of heart-bound-less Bliss Which Christ hath purchast with his Blood, for His: To whom, with Father, and the Spirit, therefore Be Glory, Praise, and Thanks for-evermore. Amen Amen Amen. FINIS. Pibrac. Quad. 5.

OR The Heauenly Muse. 1 Scarce had the April of mine age begun, When brave desire t'immortalize my Name, Did make me (oft) Rest and repast to shun, In curious proiect of som learned Frame. 2 But, as a Pilgrim, that full late doth light Vpon a crosse-way stops in sodain doubt; And, 'mid the sundry Lanes to finde the right, More with his Wit than with his feet doth scout: 3 Among the many flowrie paths that lead Vp to the Mount, where (with green Bayes) Apollo Crowns happy Numbers with immortall meed, I stood confus'd, and doubtfull which to follow. 4 One while I fought, the Greekish-Scæne to dress In French Disguise: in loftier Stile anon T'imbrew our Stage, with Tyrants bloody Gests, Of Thebes, Mycæna, and proud Ilion. 5 Anon, I sacred to th'Aonian Band My Countries Story; and, condemning much The common error, rather tooke in hand To make the Mein French, than the Sein be Dutch. 6 Anon, I meant with fawning pen to praise Vn-worthy Prince; and so, with gold and glory, T'inrich my Fortunes, and my Fate to raise, Basely to make my Muse a Mercenarie. 7 Then (gladly) thought I, the Wagg-Son to sing Of wanton Venus; and the bitter-sweet, That Too much Loue to the best wits doth bring; Theam, for my nature and mine age, too-meet. 8 While to and fro thus (tossed by Ambition) Yet vn-resolued of my Course, I rove; Lo, suddainly a sacred Apparition; Som Daughter (think I) of supernall Ioue. 9 Angelicall her gesture and her gait; Divinely-sweet her speech and countenance; Her Nine-fold Voice did choicely imitate Th'Harmonious Musik of Heauens nimble Dance. 10 Vpon her Head, a glorious Diadem, Seaven-double-folded, moving diuersly; And on each fold sparkled a pretious Gem, Obliquely turning o're our heads on high: 11 The first of Lead, the second Tin (me thought) Third Steel, the fourth of yellow Gold was cast, The fift of pale Electrum seemed wrought; Sixt Mercury; of Siluer was the last. 12 An azure Mantle on her back she wore, With art-less Art, in orderly disorder; Flourisht, and fill'd with thousand Lamps and more, Her sacred Beautie to set-forth and further. 13 Heer flames the Harp, there shine the tender Twins, Heer Charles his Wayn there twinkling Pleiades. Heer the bright Balance there the siluer Finns, And thousand Starrs more then I can express. 14 I am Vrania (then a-loud said she) Who humane-kinde aboue the Poles transport, Teaching their hands to touch, and eyes to see All th'enter-course of the Celestiall Court. 15 I quint-essence the Soule, and make the Poet (Passing himselfe) in a Divine Discourse To draw the deafest, by the ears vnto-it, To quicken stones, and stop the Oceans course. 16 I grant, My learned Sisters warble fine, And ravish millions with their Madrigalls: Yet all, no less inferiour vnto mine, Than Pies to Syrens, Geese to Nightingalls. 17 Then take Me (Bartas) to conduct thy Pen, Soar-vp to Heav'n; Sing-me th'Almightie's prayse: And tuning now the lessean Harp again, Gayn thee the Garland of eternall Bayes. 18 I cannot (grief-less) see my Sisters wrongs Made Bawds to Louers, in deceitfull faynings, In forged sighes, false tears, and filthy Songs, Lascivious shewes and counterfait complaynings. 19 Alas! I cannot with dry eyes behold Our holy Songs sould and profaned thus To grace the grace-less; praising (too-too bold). Caligula, Nero, and Commodus. 20 But, most I mourn, to see rare Verse apply'd Against the Author of sweet Composition: I cannot brook to see Heav'ns King defy'd By his own Souldiers, with his own Munition. 21 Man's eyes are field-vp with Cimmerian mist: And, if ought pretious in his Life he reach, Through sundry hands, by the Heav'ns bounty is't: But God, himselfe, the Delphian Songs doth teach. 22 Each Art is learn'd by Art: but Poesie Is a meer Heauenly gift; and none can taste The Deaws we drop from Pindus plentiously, If sacred Fire have not his brest imbraç't. 23 Thence is't, that many great Philosophers, Deep-learned Clarks (in Prose most eloquent) Labour in vain to make a grace-full Verse, Which many a Novice frames most excellent. 24 Thence is't, that yerst, the poore Meonian Bard, Though Master, means, and his owne eyes he misses, Of Olde and New is for his Verse preferd, In's stout Achilles, and his wise Vlysses. 25 Thence is't, that Ovid cannot speak in Prose: Thence is't, that Dauid (Sheapherd, turned Poet) So soon dooth learn my Songs: and Youths compose After our Art, before (indeed) they knowe-it. 26 Dive day and night in the Castalian Fount, Dwell vpon Homer and the Mantuan Muse, Climb night and day the double-topped Mount, Where the Pierian learned Maidens vse: 27 Read while thou wilt, read ouer every Book In Pergamus, and in the famous Citie That her great name, of Alexander took; Still ply thy Pen, practice thy language (wittie) 28 Take time inough, choose seat and season fit, To make good Verse; at best aduantage place thee: Yet worthy fruit thou shalt not reap of it, For all thy toil, vnless Minerua grace thee. 29 For, out of Man, Man must him all advance, That time-proof Poems ever hopes to vtter; And, extased (as in a holy Transe) Into our hands his Sensiue part must put-her. 30 For, as a humane Fury makes a man Less than a man: so Diuine-Fury makes-him More then himself; and sacred Phrenzie then Above the heav'ns bright-flaming Arches takes-him. 31 Thence, thence it is that divine Poets bring So sweet, so learned, and so lasting Numbers, Where Heav'ns and Nature's secret works they sing, Free from the power of Fates eternall slumbers. 32 True Poets, right are like winde-Instruments, Which full, do sound; emptie, their noise surceases. For, with their Fury lasts their Excellence; Their Muse is silent, when their Fury ceases. 33 Sith therefore Verses haue from Heav'n their spring, O rarest spirits! how dare you (damned scorners) Profanely wrest, against Heavn's glorious King, These sacred gifts given from your lives adorners? 34 Shall your ingratefull Penns be alwayes waiting, As Seruants to the Flesh, and slaues to Sin? Wil you your Volumes evermore be fraighting With Dreams and Fables, idle Fame to win? 35 Still will you fill the World with Loue-sick groans? Still will you fawn on Fools, and flatter Euill? Still will you parbreak loathsom passions? Still will you make an Angell of a Diuell? 36 Still will you comment on this common Storie? And (Spider-like) weaue idle Webs of folly? O! shall we neuer hear you sing the glory Of God, the great, the good, the iust, the holy? 37 Is 't not enough, that in Your soules, yee feel Yout Paphian Fire? but every Brothel-Lover, T'inchaunt the wanton with his wanton stile, Must (Strumpet-like) his lustfull flame discover? 38 Is 't not enough, that you your selues do wallow In foul delights? but that you must intice Your heed-less Readers, your loose Race to follow; And so, for Vertue, make them fall to Vice? 39 Tunes, Notes and Numbers (whence wee doo transfer Th'harmonious powr that makes our Verse so pleasing). The sternest Catoes are of force to stir, Mans noblest spirits with gentle Fury seazing. 40 And, as a Seal printeth in wax (almost) Another Seal; A learned Poet graveth So deep his passions in his Readers ghost, That oft the Reader th'Authors form receiveth. 41 For, Verse's vertue, sliding secretly (By secret pipes) through th'intellectuall Notions; Of all that's pourtraid artificially Imprinteth there both good and evill motions. 42 Therefore did Plato from his None-Such banish Base Poëtasters, that with vitious verse Corrupted manners, making vertue vanish; The wicked, worse; and even the good, perverse. 43 Not those that car'd to match their gracefull Phrazes To grave-sweet matters: singing now the praise Of iustest Iove; anon from errors mazes Keeping th'vn-steady, calling back the straies. 44 O profane Writers! your lascivious Ryme Makes our best Poets to bee basely deemed As Iugglers, Iesters, and the scum of Time; Yea, with the Vulgar less than these esteemed. 45 You make chaste Clio, a light wanton Minion; Mount Helicon, a Stews; your ribaldry Makes prudent Parents (strict in their opinion) To bar their Children reading Poëtry: 46 But, if you would (yet at the last) inure-yee Your Gnidian Idols in the dust to trample, And rouz the Genius of your sacred Fury, To shew the World som holy Works example; 47 All would admire your Rymes, and doo you honour, As Secretaries of the Heav'nly Court; And Maiesty would make you wait vpon-her, To manage Causes of the most import. 48 The chain of Verse was at the first invented To handle-onely sacred Mysteries With more respect: and nothing else was chanted For long time after in such Poësies. 49 So did my David on the trembling strings Of his divine Harp onely sound his God: So milde-soul'd Moses to Iehova sings Iacob's deliverance from th'Egyptians Rod. 50 So Debora and Iudith, in the Camp; So Iob and Ieremy, in cares oppressed; In tune-full Verses of a various stamp, Their ioyes and sighes divinely-sweet expressed. 51 And therefore Satan (who transforms him slily T'an Angell of the Light, the more t'abuse) In's Oracles and Idols speaking wily, Not common Prose, but curious Verse did vse. 52 So the fond made-Priests of Apollo sung His Oracles in sweet Hexameters, With doubtfull Riddles from a double tongue, To hapless-hopefull, conquered Conquerers: 53 So th'ancient voice in Dodon worshipped: So Æsculapius, Hamon, and the fair And famous Sibyls spake and prophecied In Verse: in Verse the Priest did make his praier. 54 So Orpheus, Linus and Hesiodus (Whereof the first charm'd stocks and stones, they say) In sacred Numbers dar'd (to profit vs) Their divine secrets of deep skill convay. 55 O! you that long so for the Laurell Crown, Where's possible a richer Theam to take Than his high praise, who makes the Heav'ns go round, The Mountains tremble, and dark Hell to quake? 56 This subiect is a deep, broad, bound-less Ocean, Th'aboundant Horn of Plentifull discourse; The Magazin of wealth for Wits quick motion; Of divine Eloquence th'immortall source. 57 Base Argument, a base stile ever yeelds: But (of it selfe) a lofty subiect raises Grave stately words, and (of it selfe) it gilds It self; and crowns the Author's Pen with praises. 58 If then you would survive your selves so gladly, Follow not him who burnt (to purchase fame) DIANA's Temple: neither him that madly, To get renown, a Brazen Bull did frame. 59 Imploy no more th'Elixir of your spirit On Cytherea and her winged Son. How better never to bee named were-it, Then named (blamed) for a mischief don? 60 Wee, Thrice three Sisters of Parnassus Hill, Bee Virgins all: your Pallas self is so: So is that sacred Tree-turn'd Lady still, From whose pure Locks your stil-green Laurels growe. 61 Then, consecrate-mee (rather) your Wits miracles, To sacred Stories: spend your Eloquence In singing loud those holy Heav'nly Oracles, Pour there your Soules pure pretious quinte-ssence. 62 Let Christ (as Man-God) bee your double Mount Whereon to Muse; and, for the winged hoove Of Pegasus, to dig th'immortall Fount, Take th'Holy-Ghost, typ't in a Silver-Dove. 63 Excelling Works preserve the Memory Of those that make them: The Mausolean Toomb Makes Artemisia, Scopas, Timothy, Live to this day, and still in time to com. 64 Name-less had Hiram been, but for his aid Towards God's Temple, built in Israel: And, but for God's Ark, in dark silence laid Long since had been th'Hebrew Bezaleel. 65 Then, sith these great and goodly Monuments Can make their makers after death abide; Although themselves have Vanished long since, By Age, and Rage, Fire, Arms and Storms destroy'd: 66 O think (I pray) how-much-much greater glory Shall you attain, when your Diviner quality In sacred strains shall sing th'Almightie's Story; Sith from immortall things springs Immortality. 67 I knowe, you'll answer, that the Antient Fictions Are (even) your Song's soule: and that every Fable Ay breeding other, makes by their commixtions (To vulgar ears) your Verse more admirable. 68 But, what may bee more admirable found Then Faith's Effects? Or what doth more controul Wit's curious pride? or with more force confound The reach and reason of a humane soule? 69 I'ld rather sing the Towr of Babylon, Than those three Mountains, that in frantik mood The Giants pil'd to pull Iove from his Throne: And Noah's, rather than Deucalion's Flood. 70 I'ld rather sing the sudden shape-depriving Of Assur's Monarch, than th'Arcadian King: And the Bethanian Lazarus reviving, Than valiant Theseus Sons re-sodering. 71 Th'one onely doth delight their ears that hear it; The other tends to profit in som measure: But, onely Hee the Laurel Crown doth merit, Who wisely mingles Profit with his Pleasure. 72 As sweetest walks are by the waters side, And safest swimming neer the flowry shoar: So, prudent Writers never doo divide Knowledge from Mirth, Mirth from Instructions lore. 73 Such shall you bee, if such a task you take: For teaching others, you your selves shall learn-all Rules of good life; and happy so shall make, As is your subiect, your owne Songs eternall. 74 Abandon then those Ould-wives-Tales and Toyes; Leave the Blinde Lad, who but the blinde abuses; And onely, addle, idle hearts annoyes. Hence-forth no more profane the Sacred Muses. 75 But (O!) in vain, in vain (alas!) I plain-mee; Som subtile Aspicks, to eschew my Charming, Stop their dull ears; som Epicures disdain-mee And my advice, and scoff my zealous warning. 76 Som, for a season, listen to my Laws; But soon Relapse, through the Worlds sorceries: And this discourse (which but the Vertuous draws) Enters at one ear, out at th'other flies. 77 Alas! I scarce see one (nay, none at all) That courts not Venus, or corrupts not more His golden Hony with profaner Gall: Although this Age of happy Wits have store. 78 But thou, my Darling, whom before thy birth, The Sacred Nine, that sip th'immortall spring Of Pegasus, predestin'd to set forth Th'Almightie's glory, and his praise to sing: 79 Although their Subiect seem a barren soyl, Which finest Wits have left for fallow fields; Yet, doo thou never from this task recoyl: For, what is rarest, greatest glory yeelds. 80 Faint not (my-Salust) though fell Enuie bark At the bright Rising of thy fair Renown; Fear not her malice; for, thy living Work (In spight of spight) shall not be troden down. 81 That Fames-foe Monster, is much like a Curr, That fiercely barks at every new-com Guest; But, once-acquainted, after doth not stur, Saving at strangers; fawning on the rest. 82 Or like a thick, dark, pitchie Clowd of smoak, That round-about a kindling Fire suppresses With waving smother, the new Flame to choak: But, as the Flame augments, the Fume decreases. 83 Wherefore (my deer) that sacred Path pursue, Where none but Heav'n-blest happy spirits can pase: And heer I swear, that shortly for thy due, Among best Wits thou shalt have worthy place. 84 With these sweet accents (graç't in vtterance) Vrania holding in her Maiden-hand A glorious Crown, rapt-vp in sacred Transe) My prostrate soule, prest to her high Command. 85 Since when, alone that Loue my heart hath fired; Since when, alone that Winde my sails hath spread: O happy! might I touch that Crown (desired) But with my hand, not put it on my head. 86 Now out of zeal to your deer Name and You (Deer noble Name, thac I must aye affect: And whose Disasters I must euer rue) This Monvment of Honour I erect To you (sweet Essex) as your Vertues due, For an eternall token of Respect: Where, your great worth, and my good-will shall stand Inrowld for ever with Vrania's hand. FINIS. THE TRIVMPH OF FAITH THE TRIVMPH of FAITH, former-ly DEDICATED, and now againe, for ever Consecrate to the gratefull Memorie of the first kinde Fosterer of our tender Muses, my neuer-sufficiently-Honored deer Vncle W. PLVMB, Esq. For whose deer Bones wee would a Toomb aduance Of Golde, and Silver, and Corinthian Brasse, VVith Ivorie Pillars mixt with Iette and Rance, Rarer and richer than th'olde Carian's was; And round about is wright His vertues shining bright: And stately deck the same With stories of his Fame: But, sith the most of our poore Meanes (alas!) Not the least part of that Rich Pride affoords; For want of Wealth, wee build a Toomb of Words: Which (though it cost less) shall out-last The proud clowd-threatning Battlements, Th'aspiring Spires by Nilvs plac't, And Hell-deepe-founded Monuments. For greedy waste of Hours, that all things else devours, Spares the sweet Maydes of sacred Helicnn: And those fayre Ladyes, to their Friends alone, This precious Gift doo give, Still (after Death) to Live. To Guy de Faur, Lord of Pibrac; W. Salustius du Bartas. I hate those Satyrs, that the best still bite: I hate the shameless Pens that sooth the vicious: For, these be flatterers, and those malicious: But, wise is hee can hit the Mean aright. I pinch not oft, nor doo I often praise: Yet, must I needs praise the praise-worthy still: I cannot hold my free and forward quill From those whom Heauen adorns with speciall rayes. Now, all that God doth by retail bestowe On perfect'st men, to thee in grosse he giues: Therefore my Muse thy praise so often driues, For duties sake, but not to slatter so. Our Age's wonder! when thy tongue (refin'd By vse and Art) in our King's name dilates, With Counsails, Germane or furr'd Polish States, The sweet-tongu'd Cyneas thou doost make vs minde. In Priuy counsell, when our miseries Thou doost be-moan, most Nestor-like thou art: And when, in Paris Parliament, thy part Of Lawes thou Plead'st, thou seem'st to Scævolize. Thy Latin Prose dooth match smooth Salusts stile: And when thy Pen distils the Nectar sweet Of Helicon (where all the Muses meet) Me thinks I read sweet Virgil all the while. In honor of these gifts, this gift I bring, Small for my paines, great for the Argument: But, if the Heav'ns had richer treasure lent, Thy New-yeers-gift should be som better thing. THE TRIVMPH OF FAITH. Canto I. 1 Neer th'hour that Eryein' Aurora cals, And shee the Sun; sad Morpheus, entring in Through's horny gate, to shew mee did begin A sacred Virgins stately Trivmphals. 2 Then Faith (for so shee hight) bids with celerity, Of Pen and Paper that I make provision To write the summ of this celestiall Vision, To bee recorded vnto all Posterity. 3 I knowe my task to bee impossible: I knowe, in this, mans eyes are beetle-blinde: His ears quite deaf; clean void of sense his minde: But, hardest thing's Faith makes most possible. 4 Eternall Sun, O scatter with thy Light All misty clouds, that make mee not to see Thy health-full Face: and give true Faith to mee; Since Faith, sans Faith, cannot bee knowne aright. 5 Faith sits triumphant on a Carr of gold, Of Tubal's making, where blew Saphires shine, Rich Diamonds, and many Rubies fine, And if ought else the World more costly hold. 6 Her glorious Charrets rowling wheels are like The holy wheels the great Ezechiel saw: For, one self-spirit, self-winde, and will doth draw Their rest-less courses, equall, both alike. 7 The Bird that led the Roman Standards out: The Bird, that fixtly can oppose his eyes Against the greatest light in all the skies; High through the air, draws this rich Coach about. 8 Faith flaunts it not in silver, silk, nor gold, Nor pretious scarlet of the Tyrian Dy, Nor paints her face to hide deformity; But, as shee is, shee doth her self vnfold. 9 Her body (that all bodies doth disgrace) Like Iuno's Bird, is full of watchfull eyes Whose holy glances pearce the lofty skies, Pearce Air, and Heav'n, and see God face to face. 10 Sh'hath many sweet and flowing tongues to praise The Lord of Hoasts: sh' hath strong and mighty wings (Passing the swiftnes of all earthly things) That in a moment vp to Heav'n her raise. 11 Her glorious head is compast with a Crown, Not made of Olive, Pine, or Lawrell bough, Nor Parsly Wreath, which Grecians did allow Th'Olympian games for signals of renown: 12 But, of fresh Roses pluckt from Honours Tree, That never shrink for Winters chilling frost, That wither not when Titan parcheth most: For, by the Lord they ever wat'red bee. 13 Now, stain-less Truth for Standards doth display Two Testaments: next, Courage marshals right Th'vndaunted Troops that are prepar'd to fight Vnder her Colours, into battell-ray. 14 Then, Constancy bears a two-edged Blade, And Patience an impenetrable Shield; Whose brightnes hath inforc't more Monsters yield, Then that which of grim Gorgon's head was made. 15 Next, Charity, that kindely doth prefer Her neighbours good before her owne vtility: Repentance, Hope, and hearty-milde Humility, Doo flank the wings of Faith's triumphant Carr. 16 For, Faith (indeed) without her Maids were vain. But, as the Sun can never lack his light, Nor Fire want heat: so (if wee mark aright) Faith cannot want these Hand-maids in her train. 17 Before this Coach there is a Beldam gon, That seems (at first) fairer then Helen was: But, neerer view'd, shee is more foul (alas!) Then fell Megera, Alect', or Tesiphon. 18 Shee never goes (like Faith) with open face; But seeks for masks, vizards, and garments gay, For cloke on cloke to keep the light away, Of her loath'd limbs to hide the foul disgrace. 19 Sh'hath tongues (like Faith) with which shee bouldly chats, Blaspheming Heav'n with filthy vanities; Sh'hath eyes (like Faith) but yet (alas!) those eyes See cleer by night, by day are blinde as Bats. 20 Sh'hath wings (like Faith) with which she soars on hy: Like Icarus, shee proudly mounts aloft; Forgetting that her feathers are so soft, Till Phœbus force her waxen wings doth fry. 21 Shee (whom, sans reason, men have Reason hight) Since first, in Fire, the Lord the Air inclos'd; In Air the Sea, in Sea the Earth dispos'd; Hath with milde Faith maintain'd continuall fight; 22 Now, arming Kings, and putting in their brains, That nothing less beseems their Royall State Than vnder Faith their Scepters to abate; Than to endure her gentle-ruling reans. 23 Another-while, shee puffs with pois'ny pride (Whom their Disciples onely Doctors deem) Such as (I grant) have spent much oil, and time, To draw mens soules from the true way, too wide. 24 Yet still, the Lord (who still vpholds the iust) Hath still the cause of holy Faith maintain'd; Hath still so well her holy side sustain'd, That still her foes ly groveling in the dust. 25 A thousand Princes, bound in fetters fast, Before her march, that her milde yoak disdain'd; That all the Earth with blood of Saints distain'd, And Christ his Church with Fire and Sword did waste. 26 Hee that (the first) in this worlds Pupillage, Cain. Brain'd his owne brother, leads this bloody crew: Then th'hardned Tyrant, that did dare pursue Through the Red-Sea Gods chosen Heritage. Pharaoh. 27 Ioash.Then saw I him that Zachary did stone; Athaliah, Ahab, wicked Abian, Occazias, Amon, Ahaz, and Ioram: Then all that fate on the Samarian Throne. 28 Nebuchadnezar.I saw Senacherib, and Him whose Grace Was turn'd to grass, proud Haman, and withall Baltsazar.Brave Holophernes, and who on the Wall Read how his Kingdom to the Medes should passe. 29 Antioclius illustris. Annas and Caiaphas, and him that set His hatefull idoll in the holy Place; Which, five Iew-brethren bravely did deface: All these too-late, in sad repentance fret. 30 Herod.The Tyrant too, that (at our Saviours birth) In Cradles kill'd so many Innocents: Pilat.And that vile Iudge, whose seared conscience Condemn'd the guilt-less Iudge of all the earth. 31 Nero.That viperous Monster (of Mankinde the shame) Who, Mother, Wives, Brethren and Sisters slue, Then from a lofty Towr did laugh to view Rome's glittering Spires all on a burning flame, 32 With Seventh Severus came accompanied: Iule, Maximin with full Maximian, Cruell Gallerian, fond Domitian, That (god-less) would like God bee honoured. 33 Then saw I him that served Saperes For foot-stool base: I saw Valerian, Decius, Lycinus, and Hostilian; And fell Maxentius, marching next to these. 34 I saw great Traian, learn'd Aurelius, And learned Dioclesian: all which three Among wise Cæsars might well praised bee, Had they not been 'gainst Christians barbarous. 35 Anastasius. Iustin, Theodorus, Constantinus Sonne, Heraclius, Valence, Constance, Manuel, Eumeves.And that Bizantian Prince, that did mis-tell A four-fould Essence in the onely One. 36 Then (Goths and Uandals, Gens'ric, Trasimond) Honorius, Theodorus, Totilas, Alaricus, and Rhotoris (alas!) Who Rome and Africk with Saints blood have drown'd. 37 But who is this, that, loaden so with chains, By thousand hang-men racked with despight, By thousand Furies tortur'd day and night, For god-less deeds receives so righteous pains? 38 'Tis Mahomet, who more by Mavors Art, Sergiusæ Nestorian Monk bolp. Mahomet to make his Alcoran. Than's Alcaron (Bird of a Friers nest) Hath all subdu'd the wealthy golden East, And won withall the triple world's best part. 39 I see Prince Saladine, of match-less force, But th'Alcoran too-deeply favouring: Haly the Caliphe, and the wanton King That did our Maids on Edess Altars force. 40 With wrath and woe old Ottoman opprest, Too-late repentance in his face presents; And Mahomet, the second, much laments That hee the Greekish Empery supprest. 41 So the proud scorn of (scourge-Turk) Tamberlaine, Baiazeth. That in an iron Cage was cooped straight; And hee that first presum'd to pass the Streight Which Europe's bounds divides from th'Asian. 42 Then hee that quittance did with Scythia cry, Mahomet 3. And over Sea his Scepter rais'd again; And Amurath, that did repell amain Vincenslaus, that first had made him fly. 43 Orcan (the Phrygian's fear) and Calipine, Who foil'd Sigismond's hoast, his Father fear'd; And Baiazeth, that, being haughty rear'd By Germain Tropheis, did their peace repine. 44 Hee that his Sire and Brother put to death, Selim 1. Is with a Cable kild; his Son, that quail'd Th'Hungarian King, and Rhodes and Bud assail'd, Solyman. With trembling fear now quakes like Aspen leaf. 45 And neer this Solyman there doth remain Selim. An empty room for him that yet survives, Who (by our Kings strange iars) so richly thrives, That (proud) hee threats both Germany and Spain. 46 O wretched Christians! while your civill rage 'Gainst your owne hearts doth arm your proper hands, O see you not the Turks invade your Lands, And safely spoil the Lords choise heritage? 47 The discord growne 'twixt the Bulgarian King, And th'Eastern Cæsar, even the Bridge it was For hate-Christ Turks the Hollespont to pass, And so in Greece a Pagan Scepter bring. 48 The discord of two brethren Morea lost; And (O!) I fear lest Christians home-bred fraies (Deiecting quite Christs Name, and all his praise) Bring Turks to land in farthest Western Coast. 49 Forget then, Christians, your vn-Christian iarrs (Your civill strife for wagging of a straw) Ioin hearts and hands, and all joint weapons draw In Faith's defence to fight Iehova's warrs. 50 In Asia and Egypt make your Forces knowne: Recover Gaza, Antioch, Ascalon, Tyre, Sidon, Ioppa, and King Davids Throne, And Famagosta, lost a yeer agon. Canto II. 1 Though bloody Tyrants had in every age Busiris Altars, Bulls of Phalaris, Gemonid Ladders, making Land and Seas, And fire, and air, racks of their beastly rage: 2 Yet could they never wound the Church so much, As have the Writings of the worldly Wise, Which on mens soules doo felly tyrannize; The tortures, onely did the bodies touch: 3 These Sages, puft with self-conceited pride, Dare to controule th'Almighties match-less work, Where mystike Secrets from our senses lurk, The search whereof the Lord hath vs deni'd. 4 And, though the spred of our too-feeble wings Scant raise vs from the ground, they mount aloft Even vp to Heav'n, where they doo measure oft (By their Wits compass) Gods eternall things. 5 Their knowledge is but meerly ignorance, They lose the Truth in seeking it too much: For, Truth doth still conceal her self from such, And to the humble doth her self advance. 6 Truth alwaies dwels within the holy Tables Of God's live word; not in our wanton brain, Which daily coining som strange Error vain, For Gold takes Lead, for Truth electeth Fables. 7 Long time their reasons were with Reason rife, To wrack the Church, and Faith to ruinate: But, now I see they doo detest, too-late, Their former errors and their former life. 8 In formost rank, march all Gymno sophists, Follow'd by all the cunning Persian Mages, 1. The antient Sages of the world. The old French Druids, learned Calde-Sages, And flowr of all the Brachoman sophists. 9 Pythagoras, Zeno, Xenophanes, Parmenides, merry Democritus, Philosophers, Greek &amp; Latin. Empedocles, and sad Heraclitus, Archytas, Naucides, Nausiphanes. 10 Brief, all the Doctors of the Latin Sect, Tearing their Tresses, melting into tears, Beating their breasts, detest those Dreams of theirs: And so the greatest of the Greeks Elect. 11 Anaximander, Anaximenes, Mylesian Thales, Anaxagoras, Gnawen with continuall care, cry out (alas) On their owne Errors; and so Socrates. 12 Cleanthes and Chrysippus next to these, With Zeno (Storks) that have often strai'd: And next, the Cyniks (all as ill-appai'd) Diogenes, Crates, Antisthenes. 13 There, the grand Patrons of each Academ, Plato, Speusippus, and Zenocrates, Clytomachus, Crantor, Carneades; And hee that labours to conciliate them. 14 There mourns in vain Pirrhon (Son of Plistarchus) That (fond) beleeves not what his ears doo hear, Eyes see, nose smells, tongue tastes, and hands doo bear: Then Timon, Hecate, and Anaxarchus. 15 There, the Stagirian (that, with learned vain, Aristotle. In's Works includes the Encyclopedy) Sorry t'have led so many soules awry, With Strato and Theophrastus doth complain. 16 There, carnall Epicurus wails with tears, And Metodorus: next to whom there came Both Aristippi, Aretas, and that same Vile wretch that coin'd a worser sect then theirs: 17 I mean that Monster Theodorus hight, Who shame-less saies, There is no God at all: And that the Wise may (when occasions fall) Be Lier, Traitor, Theef and Sodomite. 18 Alas! how true the Proverb prooves too-plain, Saying, Bad weeds growe every-where apace: But, holsom herbs scant spring in any place Without great labour, and continuall pain. 19 O Grecians Bane, thy mortifying Mores To growe in Rome the swelling Seas have crost; From Rome too soon over the Alps have past As far as France, and all her neighbour shoars. 20 Thy deadly Plant now buds on Iustice Throne, In Christian Camps, and Courts of Christian Kings, In Church and Chair, and every-where so springs, That with thy thistles all is over-growen. 21 But, now return wee to our task again: All these Wise-men, of God have false defin'd, Of Chiefest-good, Soules, or wrong place assign'd Where (dead) wee feel or end-less peace or pain. 22 3 Deceitfull Sophists and Apostates, open Enemies to Christ.Those that (since Christ, true Son of righteousnes, On our Horizon brought the daies broad light) Have led mens soules in dark eternall night, Feel torments worthy of their wickednes. 23 Next Symmachus, Porphirius marcheth first: Lucian and Celsus then, whose hardned heart The Gospell (knowen) did labour to subvert; And Iulian also, of all Cæsars worst: 24 Who, knowing well that tortures were but vain To force the Saints from the right Faith to stray; (By sugred stile) studies another way, Turns truth to lies, and lies to truth again. 25 4. Cabalists, and Talmudists, Rabbies.Next, I perceive the Circumcised Crew Of Cabalists, and burly Talmudists, Troubling the Church with their mysterious Mists; Who, wel-nie dead, 'gainst Christ doo spet and spew: 26 Much like to Snakes, that wagg their sting-less sting, When as (their heads and bodies being slain) They threat their Foes with force-less fury vain, And to their Graves their Thirst of vengeance bring. 27 Now com the Doctors of the Alcaron; 5. Turkish Doctors. Who, mingling poison, by their subtil gloze, The World's blinde eyes with darker Clouds inclose; They shew their sorrow by their saddest mone. 28 But, who are these that were Faith's Livery, 6. Heretiks old and new. And bear the badge of Faith's best Souldiers; And yet are loaden with such bolts and bars; And so despised of Faith's company? 29 These (if I erre not) are the Heretikes Who (pusht by proud and curious spirits) doo blend Both Heav'n and Earth, and busily contend To lead the World in crooked paths and Creeks. 30 Now, as soft windes, with straight constrained breath (Through chinks and crannies stealing privily) Hurt more our health, than boist'rous blasts that fly, And roule (abroad) the stones vpon a heath: 31 And, as the Foe, that shakes the Cities walls With thundring shot, is not so dangerous As a lewd Burgess, false and mutinous, That in the Town stirs-vp domestick brauls: 32 So, Pagans, Turks, Iews, doo not damnisie The Faith like these: their open violence May bee avoided: but false fair-pretense Is hardly 'scaped with much ieopardy. 33 They make (like vs) a fair religious showe: They have (like vs) one Church, one Faith, one Lord: They read (like vs) one Bible, and one Word: So fly they are God's Church to over-throwe. 34 In foremost rank, heer goe the Sadduces, That do deny Angels and Resurrection; Both Spirits of grace, and also of reiection: Then th'Esseans foul, and Formal Pharises. 35 Next, that deceiver, that devised first Simon Magus, Nicolaus, author of the Sect of the Nicolaits. Church-chaffering: and after him ensues That mariage-Foe, who brutishly renues Pluto's (not Plato's) Common-law accurst. 36 Cerinthus next, all bruis'd, and bleeding fresh, Of Beam-pasht wounds that brain'd him suddenly, When in the Baths (profane) hee did deny Christs holy God-head, hidden in our flesh. 37 For having likewise warr'd against the same God-head of th'onely Man-God; Ebion, Paul, Samyan, Photin, Carp'crate, Artemon, Shew by their looks their sorrow and their shame. 38 There mourns that Manes, who did fondly fain Two divers Gods, Authors of Good and Ill; There, Valentin the air with cries doth fill, Who did deny that bodies Rise again. 39 Cerdon (great Patron of the Sto?call) Marcion, Menander, pitious Moan doo make: There sighs Apelles; saying, Christ did take Not (simply) flesh, but flesh fantasticall. 40 There goes Basilides, who canoniz'd Cyrenean Simon in our Saviovrs steed; Montanus there (a frantick head indeed) Who guiltless Children kill'd and sacrifiz'd. 41 There, Tatians, Encratits, Severions, Sabellians too, which (seeking th'vnity In God's great Essence) lost the Trinity; Abhord too-late their fond conclusions. 42 Arrias. There, th'Alexandrian Priest, that yerst did void His entrails at the stool, whose Heresie (Witching wel neer th'Earths Vniversity) With Sword and Schism the World so much annoy'd, 43 Sadly behoulds sad-marching Macedonius And Eunomus, who at the first had sowne His poisony seeds; but after, of their owne They gathered two other Sects erronious. 44 Bizantian Nestor, and (our owne) Pelagius, Libian, Donatus, Luciferians, Euticheans fond, and fond Priscillians, All frown and fret for inward grief outrageous. 45 Shall I conceal Servetus, and the train Of those Deists that in Sarmatia swarms: And (Kingling) Muncer, that with frantick arms, Founds hundred sorts of Anabaptists vain? 46 Both Syrtes sands I might as eas'ly number, As number those, whose sweet inchanting Writs With Error's dregs have drenched wanton Wits, Chiefly'n this Age, which all corruptions cumber. 47 For, Satan now him so insinuates In faithless hearts, that ween themselves bee wise, That so foul Error can hee not devise, But shall bee backt by strong associates. 48 I see the Beast that bears the purple Whore 7. Antichrist &amp; the Schismatiks. (Great Anti-Christ vsurping powr Divine) Set on Seaven Hils; who with her whoredoms wine Makes drunk the Princes that her Seat adore. 49 And (last of all) I see the Schismaticks, Which (renting Christ's vnseamed coat in twain) Trouble the Church-peace with contentions vain; Follow too neer the steps of Hereticks. Canto III. 1 Great Sire's great Son! O live, God's lively face, Wisedom conceived of the onely Wise: To vs giv'n Giver: First and Last: born twice; Once, in full Time; once, out of all Times space. 2 Beam of that Sun which fils the world with Light: Life of our life, our death's death, Stingers sting: Our perfect, wise, iust, holy, valiant King, Word, that no word can full express aright: 3 O Lord, draw, draw mee, draw mee from this throng, Whose feet and hands are bould to war with Thee: For, with dry eyes I can them never see, Nor without grief recite them in my Song. 4 Ah! I am out; now (my dear God) I goe From Babel to Ierusalem, the Land Of Life, Saints House, and holy Ark, to stand Against all Seas, and all rough storms that blowe. 5 Lo heer these Champions that have (bravely-bould) Withstood proud Tyrants, stoutly consacring Their lives and soules to God, in suffering: Whose names are all in Life's fair Book in-roul'd. 6 All-hail, Saint-Souldiers, let vs once imbrace: O valiant Knights Her mee your hands and brows Adorn with Palms, and with Apollo's boughs: Let present honours former shames deface. 7 Com, sacred Kings, O holy Princes, com: Com to this Triumph Lords, whose valiant hands Have Satan's kingdom sought to bring in bands, And in your Crowns giv'n Faith the chiefest room. 8 Moses. Iosua.Hee, that (the first) Isaac infranchised, Leads by the hand that Duke, whose faithfull word Stopt Phœbus Coursers, and whose conquering Sword Subdu'd the Land the Lord had Promised. 9 Samson.Hee, that, but armed with an Asses bone, Slew thousand Foes, Sangar, Othoniel, Ahod and Ieptha, Barac, Samuel, And (th'Heathens scourge) triumphant Gedeon. 10 David.That great King-Prophet, Poet, Conqueror, Sweet Psalmograph: Asa, that Idols brake: Iosias.Hee, that made all the Idol-altars quake; And (after) did the Paschal Lamb restore. 11 Iehosaphat, Ioathan, Azarias; And hee, whose life the Lord did dis-abbridge, Whom Heav'nly arms, from Assur did vnsiege; The most religious, match-less Ezechias. 12 Wise Mardochey; and the five Maccabees; All, the right heirs of heart and zeal paternall, Receiue their guerdon from the great Eternall, And vp again their stooping standards raise. 13 Before these Warriours, and the Royall Band, March holy Fathers, that with vertue rare, And holy Doctrine, did the Divell dare; Foiling the force of his infernall hand. 14 Henoch. Enos, by whom this Worlds great Architect Was call'd vpon, leadeth (religious): That holy Father God took-vp from vs: Noah.And hee, whose ship did save the World Elect. 15 Then Sem and Iapheth; and great Abraham, Isaac.The Faithfulls Father; and his faithfull Son; Iacob.And then his Nephew, that saw Angels run Both vp and down from Heav'n to th'earthly Frame. 16 Aaron, Eleazar, Phinees full of zeal, Good Ioyada, and hundred priests select, That were by Heav'n, by zeal, and Church, elect To keep the Law the Lord did once reveal. 17 His Father, who was sent to sweep the way Zacharias. Ioseph. Of sweet Messias; then, the man suppos'd To bee His Sire; then, Hee that Him inclos'd In's ioyfull arms, and sung a Swan-like Lay. Simeon. 18 Then Barnabas, Titus, and Timothy, (Paul's famous Friends, Sins fierce and deadly Foes) And hee that did, by Sol's Eclipse, suppose Som greater Sun to bee Eclips't than hee. 19 Then (this brave Triumph to adorn the more) All on a rowe a hundred Prophets com, Which have so sure fore-told the things to-com, As if (indeed) they had been don before. 20 There first coms hee, that in the Coach of fire Elias. By God's strong Spirit was rapt above the Air: And then his Servant, that was made his heir Elizeus. Of cloak and knowledge, as hee did desire. 21 Hee that reproov'd old Ishay's Sceptred Son Nathan. For double fault; Amos, Ezechiel, Ioel, Semayah, Abdiah, Daniel; And hee that three daies in the Sea did won. Ionas. 22 With these, I see the Son of Barachy, Zachariah. Both Michais, Baruc, Iehu, Ieremias, Agg, Abacuc, Nahum, and Sophonias, Ahias, Hose, Esdras, Malachy. 23 The glorious troop that march before this troop, Are martyrs all, who (full of constant zeal) Their faith infract with their owne bloods did seal, And never did to any Tyrant stoop. 24 Their blessed blood is like the morning deaw, To make more fertil all the Churches field: These are the weapons that inforce to yeeld The furious Foe (examples not a few). 25 For, as a fruit-Tree lopped in December, For one old Trunk, many new twigs returns, Which Nature kindely with sweet fruit adorns: So, one sole Martyr many doth engender. 26 First, Abel goes, then Ioyad's zealous Son, That neer the Altar (constant) yeelded breath: Esay. Iohn Baptist.The next goes hee Manasses put to death; Then hee, whose head th'incestuous Dancer won. 27 Next Salone and her Sons, who rather chose To cross the King then God, strengthning each other Even in their death; Sons worthy such a Mother, And Mother worthy of such Sons as those. 28 That Proto-Martyr, the yong faithfull Steven, Whom th'hatefull Iews with hellish rage did stone; Who, dying, saw Christ Iesus on his Throne, Leads those that for like cause their lives have given. 29 Som, smear'd with hony, for the Flies were feasts: Som, men did eat; som were on Gridirons broil'd: Som, nail'd on Crosses; som, in Caldrons boil'd; And som were throwne to most devouring beasts. 30 After the Champions of this humble Troop, I see fair Sara, Rebecca, Rachel: Then Debora, stout Iudith, and Iahel, Who (Faith's Viragoes) their proud Foes did stoop. 31 Hester.Then shee that (rais'd to Royall state and stile) Preserv'd her people, in a rank shee goes Susanna.With Naomi, Ruth, and the Dame that chose Rather to dy, than Nuptiall bed defile. 32 From these, mine ey no sooner traverseth, But I discerne three Ladies zealous-led, That sought their living Lord among the dead: Then Anna, Martha, and Elizabeth. 33 The Virgin Mary.But, my weak eyes cannot endure to gaze On beaming beauties of that Mother-Maid, Who Sire-less bore her Sire, yet ever-Maid; Of Faith and Love th'inimitable maze. 34 This, this (my Muse) this is th'Aurora clear Which brought the Sun to light the World vnkinde, A Virgin pure in body and in minde, Christ's Mother, Sister, Spouse, and Daughter dear. 35 God's holy Temple, and the happy stair Whereby the Heav'ns came downe to dwell with Earth, Rich-fraighted Ship, Vessell of rarest worth, Where Phœbus hid his beams most bright and fair. Canto IIII. 1 I thought t'have been now at my Races end; T'have (though vnworthy) born away the prize: But I fall short, my task doth longer rise; For, half the Trophe is yet hardly penn'd. 2 Before Faith's Coach, born in convenient heighth, Are curious Tables drawn by cunning hand, Where (after guise of warlik Romans) stand The Victories of never-conquer'd Faith. 3 Heer, Iericho's cloud-kissing Towrs doo fall, Iosua 6. 20. Batter'd alone by Faith's great ordinance: A count-less hoast of craking Idolants, 2 Kings 18. 13. By Esay's Faith, is heer confounded all. 2. Chro 32. 20. Esay 37. 21. 4 By Faith, meek Moses with a zeal-full ire Exod. 7. 8 9. Arms smallest Worms th'Egyptian King to vex; Daniel, by Faith, fierce Lions fury checks, Dan. 6. 12. And quenches Dragons hot impoisoning fire. 5 Heer, Paul, by Faith, fears not (in Mitylene) Acts 28. 5. The deadly sting of th'vgly Viper-Worm: Heer, myching Ionas (sunk in sudden Storm) Ionas 2. 2. Of his Deliverance findes a Fish the mean. 6 Then, in another Table, that was fram'd By Art, exceeding Art; I did espy Pale Death, blithe Health, and frail Infirmity, That had by Faith a thousand times been tam'd. 7 Moses, by Faith, doth Myriam leperize: Num. 12. 10. By Faith, Elisha (curing Naaman 2 King. 6. 14. 17. The Syrian Prince) strikes instantly his man With his Disease, for Bribing Covetize. 8 A man of God, by Faith, first strangely dri'd, 1 King. 13. 46. Then heal'd again, that Kings vnholy hand, Who made ten Tribes of God's (then) chosen Land From God, and from their lawfull Prince, to slide. 9 By Faith, Saint Paul stark-blinded Elymas: Acts 13. 11. By Faith, Saint Peter (full of iust disdain) With sudden death did smite those perjur'd twain, Acts 5. 5. 16. That durst dissemble with the Spirit of Grace. 10 Tob. 11. 11.By Faith, yong Toby kindely doth restore His Fathers sight: by sacred Faith likewise, Acts 3. 6. &amp; 14. 10.Two crooked Cripples are made straight to rise; In Lystra th'one, th'other at Temple dore. 11 Acts 21. 8.By Faith, Saint Paul did a rich Miltois cure Of grievous Flix, that him afflicted sore: Acts 9. 34.By Faith, Saint Peter likewise did restore A Palsie-sick, that eight yeers did indure. 12 Acts 20. 10.By Faith, Saint Paul did Eutichus re-lyve: 1 Kings 17. 21.By Faith, Elias rais'd the Sareptite; 2 Kings 4. 33. Elisha raised the yong Sunamite: Acts 9. 40.At Ioppa, Peter Dorcas did revive. 13 The foure Elements.Then in another Picture I did view The foure first bodies of this massie Globe; Green-gowned Tellus, Vulcan Scarlet-robe, Py'd-mantled Iuno, Neptune clad in blew. 14 2 Kings 6. 17. Elisha's Faith brought, from the lofty Skies, Bright fiery Charrets 'gainst the Syrian hoast; 1 Kings 18. 38. Elias Faith (scorning the Baal-Priests boast) Fir'd without fire his moated Sacrifice. 15 Dan. 3. 27.By Faith, three Hebrews, cast in seaven-fold flame By a proud Prince, escape the raging Fire (Their very garments sent-less and entire) While their Tormenters perish in the same. 16 Levit. 10. 21. Moses, by Faith, makes Fire from Heav'n to fall Num. 16. 35.In th'Hebrew hoast, those wretches to consume, Whose profane hands, with profane Fire and Fume, God's holy Altar had polluted all. 17 Num. 16. 30. Moses, by Faith (heard by the God of powr) Compels the Mountains burly sides to shake; Commands the Earth to rent, and yawn, and quake, To swallow Rebels, and them quick devour. 18 Exod. 14. 21. Moses, by Faith, divides the Sea in twain, When Israel came out of Egypt Land: Exod. 17. 9.Then, in the Deserts dry and barren sand, From flinty Rocks doth plentious Rivers strain. 19 Exod. 7. 20. Moses, by Faith, converts to foul black blood The Crystall Current of the seaven-fold Nile: Exod. 15. 25.By Faith again, hee makes (another while) Those stinking waters, holsom, sweet and good. 20 Thrice, silver Iordan did it self divide, To give safe passage to God's dear-belov'd: Once by the Faith of valiant Iosuah prov'd; Iosua 3. 16. Elias once: once by Elisha tri'd. 2. Kings. 2. 8. 14. 21 The zealous Thisbit did by Faith seal-vp The Heav'ns wide windows, that ther fell no Raine. In seav'n-six months: and then by Faith again 1 Kings 18. 41. (To drench the dry Earth) set them all wide-ope. 22 Likewise by Faith, the nimble-winged train, That cleave the Air, are to our service set; The Rav'ns are made to bring Elias meat, 1 Kings. 16. 6. The Dove serves Noah, Quails for Moses rain. Gen. 8. 11. Exod. 16. 13. 23 O! who is able Faith to countermand? If Faith doo force all-taming iron yield, If Faith make iron float on Neptunes field, 2 Kings 6. 6. If that Elisha's Faith strong steel command. 24 Faith hath not onely powr on things terrene, Both high and lowe; but oftentimes doth force Gods iustice too, and somtimes seems (perforce) Gods purposes to change and alter clean. 25 The Ninivits, by Faith (repenting) shun Ionas 3. 10. Their overthrowe, that Ionas threatned neer: And Ahaz Son by Faith adds fifteen yeer 2 King. 20. 10. To his short life, that seem'd already don. 26 Now, if the Giver of this Faith (wee see) Seem to incline and bow vnto her still, As bound and ready to obey her will; What marvell is't if Angels bee not free? 27 The Angels serve in Ezechias pay; 2 King 19 35. By Faith, they bring the Thisbit needfull Cates: 1 Kings 10. By Faith, they ope for Peter prison gates: Acts 12. 7. By Faith, to Iacob they direct the way. Gen. 32. 1. 28 About twelve pases past these former Pomps, Full many sacred Minstrels sound on hy Triumphant Faith's great name and dignity, Tuning aloft their Clarions, Flutes and Trumps. 29 Mark, Mathew, Luke, and (the Lords dearest) Iohn, Christs Secretaries, winde with such a brest Their warbling Cornets, that from East to West Through all the world their sacred sound is gon. 30 Both Iameses, one the Sonne of Zebedeus, Th'other Alpheus, Thomas, Simon, Andrew, Peter, Matthias, Philip, Bartholmew, Paul (Gentiles Doctor) with the good Thaddeus, 31 Sound with so sweet accord their Sagbuts long, And their shrill Fifes (heard from the North to Nile) As if one spirit did fill them all the while, And one same hand had set their holy Song. 32 While thus my spirit this strange discourse did cumber, Rare-builder Progne, earlier then the rest, Beginning th'out-most of her curious nest, Brake, with her prattling, my deep pleasing slumber. 33 Sorry to bee so sudden waakt, I would I were a Dor-Mouse for a hundred yeer, That I might sleep full twenty Lustres heer, To shun the woes that waking I behould. 34 For now (alas!) waking (with griefe) I see Babel triumphing over Sion still: And on the Good th'Vngodly work their will: The Wicked prais'd, the Righteous scorned bee. 35 I see (alas!) in these lamented Times, Mens greatest zeal in bloody murder stands: Profane our hearts; and so profane our hands: Bare Christian Name serves but to cloak our crimes. 36 Incest's a sport, and Murder Man-hood thought: Disloyalty a speciall Vertue deem'd: And Perjury sound Policy esteem'd: Medea's Arts, and Sodomie are taught. 37 Maidens bee bould, and Wives bee impudent, Princes are Tyrants, People full of rage: This Age is sink of every former Age, Receiving each Sin's vgliest excrement. 38 But, my swolne brest, shut-vp thy sighes sad gate; Stop, stop, mine eyes, the passage of your tears; Cast-off, my heart, thy deep despairing fears; That which most grieves mee, most doth consolate. 39 No, no: my Dream is true; soon shall wee see. Faith's glory shine. Satan (perceiving nie His prides Eclipse) his greatest force doth try To stop great Faith's triumphant Victory. 40 Sure, if my Card and Compasse doo not fail, W'are neer the Port: where (danger being past) Wee need not fear the billow, nor the blast Of blustring windes, nor Seas that can assail. 41 Our beastly Manners, like Gomorrha's guise: The troubled Seasons: Wars domesticall: The threats of Heav'n: are the fore-runners all Of Christ that coms to hould his last Affize. 42 That drad-desired Day shall soon appeer, Christ coms the Rav'ns from Swans to set a-side: The tares from wheat: and Goats from Lambs divide: And this brave Triumph (that I sing) is neer. 43 O Father! while this Triumph I expect, Waiting to see the Wicked's vtter Fall, And thy iust Scepter Ruling over all; Let lively Faith my Reason still direct. FINIS. TETRASTICHA. OR THE QVADRAINS OF GVY DE FAVR, Lord of Pibrac. Translated, By Iosvah Sylvester. TO THE RIGHT EXCELLENT AND MOST Hopefull young Prince, Henry. After so many golden Rules of State, Religious Lessons, Morall Precepts grave, As in your Fathers ????????? ?????.. Royal-Gift you have; These seem superfluous, or to com too-late: Yet, 't is no Error to re-iterate The Voice of Wisdome to the tender Ear Of Princes (chiefly) such as You, that bear The Hope and Hap of Europe in your Fate. And, though You want not these weak helps of ours To consummate Your Self in Excellence: Yet may those Subiects, which shall once bee Yours, Draw vertuous Wisdom, and all Duty hence, If You but daign with your dear Name to grace-it, Which (Load-stone-like) shall draw them to imbrace-it. Iosvah Sylvester. THE QVADRAINS OF PIBRAC. 1 First, honour God, and then thy Parents dear: Be True and Iust: and see thou never grudge The Innocent oppressed cause to clear; For, one-day God shall also bee thy Iudge. 2 If gold and bribes corrupt thy conscience, If fear or favour in thy Iudgement sway-thee, If thou respect the Persons difference; Bee sure that God will in the end repay-thee. 3 Begin thy Daies-Work when the Day begins, First blessing God's thrice-blessed Name (devout) And then at Evening, when thy labour ends, Praise him again: so bring the Yeer about. 4 Adore thou sitting (as the Greek doth bid) For, running praier is preposterous: With stedfast Heart God will be worshipped, But such a Heart himselfe must giue to vs. 5 Say not, My hand this Work to end hath brought; Nor, This my Vertue hath attained to: Say rather thus; This, God by mee hath wrought: God's Author of the little Good I do. 6 The World is all but a round City like, Where each may right be said a Citizen: As well the rude Barbarian as the Greek, As well the meanest as the mightiest men. 7 In this fair Citie's goodly Wals God planted And placed man as in a Sanctuary, Where Hee, himselfe in thousand parts hath painted With lively colours that doo never vary. 8 There's not a nook so small in all this Temple, Wherein Gods Greatnes doth not plain appear: Which that wee might the better all contemple, Hee placed man iust in the middle heer. 9 Yet can hee, no where better knowe the same Then in himself, wherein hee may behould (As in a Glass) Earth, Water, Air and Flame: For, all the World, his Essence doth infould. 10 Who of himselfe hath perfect Knowledge gain'd, Ignoreth nothing that hee ought to knowe: But the best means whereby it is attain'd, Is oftentimes to Wisdoms Glass to goe. 11 That which thou seest of Man, it is not Man: 'Tis but a Prison that him Captiue keeps: 'Tis but a Toomb where Hee's interred (wan): 'Tis but a Cradle where a while hee sleeps. 12 This mortall body; where the ravisht sense Sees sinnews, flesh, bones, muscles, blood and skinne, It is not Man: Man's of more excellence, As the fair Temple that God dwelleth-in. 13 Rightly to speak: what Man wee call and count, It is a beamling of Divinity: It is a dropling of th'Eternall Fount: It is a moatling hatcht of th'Vnity. 14 Then knowe (O Man) thine owne Originall: And, brave-ambitious, scorn base Cells of Earth, Sith thou shalt flourish in Heav'ns glistring Hall, And art (indeed) a Divine Plant by Birth. 15 Well maist thou vaunt thee of thy glorious Race, Not from thy mortall Parents either Line: But from thy true Immortall Fathers Grace, Who, by the Modell of his Face, made thine. 16 There's not in Heav'n a number infinite Of bright Idéas (Plato did mistake): God's onely Will (the onely Rule of Right) Was th'onely mould of all that hee did make. 17 Hee Will'd, and it was done: Hee (without pain) All kinde of Creatures (to the least that is) Created, feedeth, and doth still sustain: And re-dissolves them with that breath of his. 18 Lift vp thine eyes: The hanging Vault above, The goodly Seeling of a Watry hew, The perfect Orb's Twin-Globes that ever move, The spangled Firmament so far from view: 19 All (to bee briefe) past, present, and to come, In Earth and Sea, and Air (beyond your seeing); So soon as God thought good, each in their room Immediately received All their Beeing. 20 Shunne Epicures profane and filthy sect (Bold Mis-creants, blaspheming every way) The which no God acknowledge nor respect, Save onely Nature and her fatall Sway. 21 And in the meane-while (like the grunting Hog) Lie alwaies wallowing in the stinking Mire: And feed on filth (like to the loathsome Frog) Voluptuous filth of every Flesh-desire. 22 Happy whose hope on God alone relies: And who on him in either Fortune call; As well in calmes as in calamities, And put no Trust in humane helps at all. 23 Canst thou assure thy hopes on worldly things, Frail mortall things (I pry thee tell mee, how.) Such are the greatest of all earthly Kings, And have more need to bee secur'd then Thou. 24 God is the iust-mans Anchor and his Aid, His sure Defence, when all the World forsakes-him: And therefore, then is hee the least dismaid; Knowing, that God then most to safe-gard takes him. 25 The Goods of Fortune and the Body (call'd) They are not Goods, if wee them rightly name: For, to least changes they are ever thrall'd: “But Onely Vertue still persists the same. 26 Vertue, between the Two extreams that haunts, Between too-mickle and too-little sizes; Exceeds in nothing, and in nothing wants: Borrowes of none: but to it self suffizes. 27 O Vertue! could wee see thy naked face, How would thy sacred Beauties sweetly mad-vs? Sith rarest Wits (rapt with a Seeming Grace) Have in all Ages courted (even) thy Shadowes. 28 The Parents comfort is a prudent Sonne: Now, such a Sonne if thou desirest ay, Direct him yong in Duties race to runne: But, Thine Example is the neerest way. 29 If thou be borne Sonne of a prudent Sire, Why tread'st thou not in his faire beaten Trace? If otherwise: why doost not thou desire (By vertuous Deeds) to couer this Disgrace? 30 'Tis no small Honour, from illustrous Ligne To be descended by our Predecessours: But 'tis much more, then by their Light to shine, Our selues to shine vnto our owne Successours. 31 Cease not to learne vntill thou cease to liue: Think that Day lost, wherein thou draw'st no Letter, Nor gain'st no Lesson, that new grace may giue, To make thy Selfe Learneder, Wiser, Better. 32 If any Stranger in his Iourney stray Through doubtfull Paths (as happens now and then) Direct him rightly in his readie waie; And if he fall, soone help him vp again. 33 Thine Honour more then thine owne Life respect, Th'honour (I meane) which each mans dutie drawes (To th'vtter most w' are able to effect) To GOD, our King, our Country, and our Lawes. 34 What now thou canst, deferre not till to-morrow, Like selfe-lame Sloath (of foulest Sinnes the Mother): Nor be like those who others hands doo borrow, And what themselues might doo, will doo by other. 35 Frequent the good, flie vngodly folke, Especially in thy Youths tender season, The while outrageous appetites prouoke, And arme thy Sense against the sway of Reason. 36 When to the double Way of those two Dames (Alcides-like) thou shalt be summoned, Follow thou her who farre from glorious shames, Ouer sleepe Mountaines vp to Heav'n doth lead. 37 Set not thy foot to make the blinde to fall: Nor wilfully offend thy weaker Brother. Nor wound the Dead vvith thy Tongues bitter gall: Neither reioyce thou in the fall of other. 38 Let thy Discourse be True in euery Word, Whether as publike Witnes thou be prest To cleere a Question: whether, at thy Boord With pleasant that thou cheere thy welcom Guest. 39 The Truth resembles right the right Cubes Figure (The Cube, contrary to light instability) Whose quadrat flatnes neuer doth dis-figure; Whose solide Forme admits no mutability. 40 The crafty Fowler, to beguile the Birds, Deceitfully their owne sweet Notes doth faine: So subtle Mates doo counterfeit the words, And simple guise of honest men and plaine. 41 Reueale not what in secret hath been told; Nor busily of Others things inquire. To' inquisitiue can hardly Counsell hold: The carrie-Tale is commonly a Lyer. 42 Make alwayes equall waight and lawfull measure, Though none could spie, thy dealing to discouer: But where thou hast receiued any Pleasure, Restore it still with some aduantage ouer. 43 Keep carefully what thou hast tane in charge: And when the Owner shall demand-againe-it, Deny it not; neither with Conscience large By subtle Law-tricks striue thou to detaine-it. 44 Hate euermore the bloody Homicide; Hunt him with hue and crie: as Shepheards hunt The Lybian Tigre which they haue espide Spoyling his Prey, and rioting vpon-'t. 45 'Tis not enough, that thou do no man wrong: Thou euen in others must suppresse the same; Righting the Weake, against th'vnrighteous Strong, Whether it touch his Life, his Goods, or Name. 46 Whoso the Fame of Valour doth desire, Must Tame his Anger and his Belly both, And that heart-swelting, Marrow-melting Fire, Blowne by the winde of Error and of Sloth. 47 Our-owne-Selfes Conquest is the most victorious: For in our Selues ambush our greatest Foes; And th'only vvay to make vs euer glorious, Is by stout Reason still to vanquish those. 48 If so thy Friend haue done thee som Offence, Fall not out flat, nor vrge him vvith abuse; But milde and meekely, without insolence, Make thy complaint, and take thou his excuse. 49 All men are faulty: none aliue can say, I haue not Erred; euen the Perfectest, If thou his Life in word and deed suruaigh, Thou shalt perceiue he hath Perfection mist. 50 See th'Hypocrites seuere and Saint-like guise, Whom th'elder Caro thou would'st think, for life; Yet in th'darke he groaping hunts and hies T'entice and trap his honest Neighbours wife. 51 'Tis a most busie yet a boot-les spaine, To hide ones fault: for doo the best thou can Thou canst not hide it from thy Selfe (though faine) For who can hide him from himselfe O Man)! 52 More of thy Selfe, then others be asham'd; Thy Selfe art most wrongd by thine owne offence: And of thy Selfe, thy Selfe first (Selfly-blam'd) Must giue account to thy Selfes Conscience. 53 Care not so much to seeme in outward showe, As to be good indeede and in the proofe: For from false Rumours which the Vulgar blowe, A selfe-cleere Conscience is Defence enough. 54 Relieue the Needie, after thine ability, And in their wants participate thy store. For, God doth blesse with Plenty and Tranquillity The House that pitties the distressed Poore. 55 What boot thy bagges to be so cramm'd with Coyne? Thy Ward-Robe stuffed with such store of Change? Thy Cellars filled with such choise of Wine? And of all Grainos such plenty in thy Grange; 56 If all the while the naked Poore (halfe dead With cold and hunger) shiuer at thy Gate; And at the length gets but a peece of bread, And manie times (perhaps) but hardly that? 57 Hast thou a heart so cruell, as to scorne Th'vnhappy Poore, that at thy back doth bow, Who like thy Selfe into this World is borne, And beares Gods Image euen as well as Thou? 58 Misfortune is a common lot to all; Yea, euen to Princes, Kings, and Emperours: Only the Wise are freed from her thrall, But O; where are they in this Age of ours? 59 The wise man's free, among a thousand chaines; He's only Rich (content with his estate) Only secure in Dangers, eas'd in Paines; Only true King of Fortune and of Fate. 60 He is not daunted with a Tyrants threat, But by his Trouble growes more strong and hard: Knowes his owne merit, looks not from the Great For Recompence; Vertue's her owne Reward. 61 True Morall Vertue cannot purchast be By Study, Treasure, or the Grace of Kings: Nor by one action, nor by two, or three: But long-long practice her perfection brings. 62 Who Readeth much and neuer Meditates, Is like a greedy Eater of much Food, Who so surcloyes his stomach with his Cates, That commonly they doo him little good. 63 How many might (in time) haue wise been made; Before their time, had they not thought them so? What Arttist e'r was Master of his Trade, Yer he began his Prentiship to knowe? 64 From smallest Springs, the greatest Riuers rise: But those that roar so loud and proud at first, Runne seldome farre, but soon their glory dies In som neer Bogg, by their selfs-furie burst. 65 Cursed is he that doth defraud the seed: Or who detains the Hirelings promis'd right: Or whom gratefull for the kindest deed) Thinks neuer of his Friends but in their sight. 66 For sweare thee not, what euer cause be giuen: And if for ought thou needs an Oath must take, Swear not by Man nor by the Earth, nor Heav'n, But by his sacred Name who all did make. 67 For God who doth all Periury detest, And iustly plagues it as most execrable, Would not we should the constant Truth contest By any thing that's false or alterable. 68 To som one Art apply thy whole affection; And in the Craft of others seldom mell: But in thine owne, striue to attain perfection. For 'tis no little honour, to excell: 69 T'embrace no more then one can manage fit, Not to the top of Greatnes to aspire: To vse the World, and yet not couet it: Neither to dread Death, neither death desire. 70 We must not Chastities fair Gift restrain Only to th'actuall Pleasure of the Night: And in the mean while not a whit refrain Our hart, our hand, our tongue, our care, our sight. 71 O vvhat a hard blowe is a box on th'Eare! Som-time it driues men euen besides their Wit, Especially vvhen (stunned as it vvere) With the sweet vvonder of smooth vvords, 'tis smit. 72 'Tis therfore best our tender Ears to arme, To shunne the danger of those deadly blowes: Warie Vlysses so eschew'd the Charm Of those soule-rapting Impes of Acheloes. 73 What ere it be that enters by the Eare, Immediately into the Brain doth creep; And th'only mean to shunne the mischief there, Is the Ears Casements euer close to keep. 74 Much talke is seldom without Lies among, Or at the least without som idle bables: Vnto the truth, brief Language doth belong: And many words are fit for Dreams and Fables. 75 Th'Egyptians graue aspect and sober brow, When his fore-finger seales his lips so sure; Better then Plato, doth instruct vs how To honour Silence, with deuotion pure. 76 As at the Opening of the Cabinet Of som great Prince, many rare Things we see, Rich Monuments, and all that fair and neat, From either Inde Portingals bring or wee: 77 So when the Wise and Learned doth begin T'open the Organs of his plentious Wit, A wondrous Treasure suddainly is seen, A Treasure hidden in th'Abderians Pit: 78 And Standers by, say by and by, This came From Greece, from Rome That, That from such a Place, And (lastly) that from th'Hebrue: and the same, And all the rest most full of Prudent grace. 79 Our Goods (how euer great) the least doo seem, Our Neighbours Fields still bear the better Grain: But Others harmes we alwaies light esteem; Tush, they are nothing: vvhy should they complain? 80 To th'Enuious-man no Torment I assigne; For, Iudge and Hang-man to himself he is: And there's no Denis Bull, nor Rack (in fine) So fell a Torture as that Heart of his. 81 To pourtray Slaunder, to the life, behooues To doo 't in th'instant vvhile one feeleth her: For vvho so happy that her neuer prooues, Can scarce imagine vvhat she is or vvhere. 82 Neither in th'Aire hath Shee her residences, Nor in the vvilde Woods, nor beneath the Waues: But she inhabits in the eares of Princes, Where th'Innecent and Honest she depraues. 83 And when this Monster hath once chaunc't to trap-vs, Her spightfull Cords she can so closely knit, That though at last vve happen vn-wrap-vs; The print thereof still in our Fames will sit. 84 Neuer giue Sentence in thy proper cause: In our owne case, we all Erre easily: Our interest our partiall Iudgement drawes; And euer makes the Balance hang awry. 85 Vpon the Law thy Iudgements alwayes ground, And not on Man: For that's affection-less; But Man in Passions strangely doth abound: Th'one all like God, th'other too-like to Beasts. 86 The sacred Number proueth alwayes euen, Whether diuided or intire it be: So Iustice (shar'd in Atomies) is giuen Still like it selfe, in iust equalitie. 87 Learn by long Trauail (as Vlysses conned) To gouern right thy Natiue Ithaca: Many haue Scylla and Charibdis shunned, That (after) haue at home been cast-away. 88 Before thou Promise, ponder what and why: But hauing Promis'd, what-so-euer 'twere, Yea, were it to thy greatest Enemy, Thou must perform, thy tongue hath ty'd thee there. 89 Maintain those Lawes (how euer rude and plain) Whereby (before) thy Common-wealth hath thriv'd: Good Fortune oft comes by the meanest mean: How or from whence somtimes is scarce perceiv'd. 90 In youth and age shunne Circes banefull Boule, Lend not thine Eare to Sirens wanton Notes: Least thou (inchanted in thy sense and Soule) Become more brute then Hoggs, and Doggs, and Goats. 91 We must our Will still limit with our Power, And bound our Power within the Lists of Law; Measuring both, and what so els is our, By the Right line th'eternall Iust did draw. 92 A suddaine Change in any mighty State, Is full of Danger vnto each Degree: And though Lycurgus found it fortunate, No consequent can that Example be. 93 I hate these phrases: Of Power absolute: Of full Authority: Of full proper motion. The Diuine Lawes they haue trod vnder foot, And Humane-too; for priuate Mens promotion. 94 Not right-discerning Friends from Flatterers, Light-crediting, and suddain Resolution, Young gidaie counsell, and new Seruitors, Haue often caus'd the highest States confusion. 95 Dissimulation is a seruile Vice, A vice still followed by Disloyalty, Whence in Great hearts doth Cruelty arise, Which alwayes ends in ciuill Mutiny. 96 Nought more beseemes a Prince then Liberality, So it be giuen to those that Merit well, By due proportion not by iust equality. And without but then to the Common-weale. 97 'Tis to be more then Sylla Letter-lesse, To hurrie Armes into the Vulgars hand: For, when again you think them to suppresse, In steed of Subiects, they will All command. 98 Sith all the World is nought but meerely vanity, Laugh if thou list like blythe Democritus: Yet somtimes toucht with tender-soul'd humanity, Weep for our Woes with sad Heraclitus. 99 Be kind to Strangers and propitious, And to their cause thy willing eare incline: But to bestowe thy Goods out of thy House, Is shame and wrong vnto thy self and thine. 100 I'le teach you here (if any list to proue) A passing Loue-drink, any hart to get; Loue vertuously, and be assur'd of Loue: And this (beleeue-it) is the best Receipt. 101 The Fear that springs from Loue and Reuerence, A firme support to Royall Greatnes giues: But he that makes him fear'd for Violence, Himself fears most, and in distrust still liues. 102 He that knewe right what were a Diadem, As soon would seek in a colde Toombe to lie, As girt his Temples with that glorious Gem: For, then begins he to himselfe to die. 103 For, day and night to stand as Sentinel; For Publike good ingratefull toyle to take; Incessantly to watch for others weal: This is, to Raigne, if we it rightly take. 104 I neuer saw Wisedome and Youth, but two: Nor him Command well, that had not Obay'd: Nor any fear'd, that was not hated too: Nor Tyrant, aged in his Toombe be lay'd. 105 Come not as Reuells, vvho delights not Dance: Nor on the Sea, vvho fears rough waues and winde: Nor at a Feast, vvho a good stomack vvants: Nor at the Court, vvho means to speak his minde. 106 The soothing hony of smooth Parasites: The poys'ny Tongues of slaunderous Sycophants: The ieering Buffon that the best still bites: The brazen-face of begging Cormorants: 107 To gull the Simple; and the Weake to braue: To hate the Truth; to halt in euery-thing: To vnder-mine: The Absent to depraue: These are the Flowers that in the Court doo spring. 108 An Enemy, Misfortune, and Disgrace, Are three Essayes to proue if Friends be loyall: For many haue the Name, and beare the face, That are not so, if they be put in triall. 109 Commend the State where-vnder born you are: If it be Royall, loue the Royalty: If of the Best, or meerely Popular; Allowe of either where thy Lot shall be. 110 'Tis lawfull (vvhere they vvant) to wish good Princes: But men the while must beare them as they are. 'Tis better beare a Tyrants insolences, Then to disturbe the Common-weal with Warre. 111 Sport not too boldly with thy Lord and King; And though he bid thee (if thou canst) refuse: From highest Fortunes suddain down they ding Who doo presume a Princes grace 't abuse. 112 Thou (Fortunes vvonder) that from lowest place Doo'st in a morning to the top attain: Suppose it but a winde that blew a-space Which yet yer night (perhaps) vvill calme again. 113 The meane Estate is the most permanent: We see the Vales with euery shower are drown'd; And Mountain tops with euery Thunder rent: But Little Hils are pleasant, safe, and sound. 114 Nature's with little pleas'd: enough's a Feast: A sober life, but a small charge requires: But Man the Author of his owne vn-rest, The more he hath, the more he still desires. 115 When thou shalt see th'Almighty take from hence, By one and one the Vertuous of the Land, Say boldly thus; These are the Arguments Of som drad Tempest of his Wrath at hand. 116 For, Vertuous Men are euen the Buttresses, The mighty Columnes and the Arches strong, Which against all Times fellest outrages Support a State, and doo maintain it long. 117 Man doth the shortnes of his Life repine; Yet doth not duly spend nor rightly driue The Time he hath: which might suffice his minde; If, To liue well, he did desire to liue. 118 Thou hardly canst sufficiently requite Him, vvho thy Child-hood hath been Tutor to; Nor Him, that hath instructed thee a-right, Both, well to speak, but chiefly well to doo. 119 In Theaters, at publike Playes and Feasts, Giue alwayes place vnto the hoary head: So, vvhen like age shall siluerize thy Tresse, Thou shalt by others be like-honoured. 120 Who, for thy Friendship showes himself ingrate, Unwillingly extolls thy Benefit: But to vp-brayde one, makes a Man ingrate; Who vaunts his Kindnes, payes himself for it. 121 To eate, and drink, and exercise, in measure, Three props of Health the certainest she hath: But the excess in these (or other Pleasure) Enforceth Nature, and doth hasten Death. 122 If euill men speak somtimes ill of thee, What need'st thou care? alas! it is thy Praise: Blame from the Author takes authority, And 'tis a good Report that good men raise. 123 We all confound; true Language is trans-formed; Vice oftentimes puts on the Vertues name Next onto file: 'Tis Forme to be de-formed: Blame is a Praise: and Commendation Blame. 124 Of what is spoken, euer make the best: Bear the defect of Neighbour and of Friend: Couer their fault; publish it not (at least): Ready to prayse, and slowe to reprehend. 125 He that esteems and vaunts himself for wise, Think him a foole: And Him that doth assume The name of Learned, whoso soundly tries, Shall finde him nothing but bare words and fume. 126 The better Learned, learn the more their want, And more to doubt their owne sufficiencie: And Vertuous men are neuer Arrogant. These are the Fruits of my Philosophy. FINIS. SONNETS Vpon THE LATE MIRACVLOVS PEACE IN FRANCE. TO THE MOST HONORABLE, LEARNED, and religious Gentleman, Master Anthony Bacone. Bound by your Bounty and mine owne desire, To tender still new tribute of my zeale To you (your Countries watchfull Sentinel, Whose wisedome, ours and other States admire) Lo, here I tune vpon mine humble Lyre Our neighbour Kingdomes vn-expected weale, Through suddain ceasing of Warrs enter-deale; As Celtike Muses to my Muse inspire, Miraculous the Work; and so his wit That firstly sung this sacred Miracle: A gratious Theame (if I dis-grace not it) That your graue eyes may daigne for spectacle. What e'r it be, accept it as a due From him whose all doth all belong to You. Iosvah Sylvester. TO THE FRENCH KING, Henry the fourth. Sonnet 1. [Henry, triumphant though thou wert in war] Henry, triumphant though thou wert in war, Though Fate and Fortitude conspir'd thy glory, Though thy least Conflicts well deserue a Story; Though Mars his fame by thine be dark'ned far; Though from thy Cradle (Infant Conquerer) Thy martiall proofs haue dimm'd Alcides praise; And though with Garlands of victorious Bayes Thy Royall temples richly crowned are: Yet (matchless Prince) nought hast thou wrought so glorious As this vn-lookt-for, happy Peace admired; Whereby thy self art of thy self victorious: For, while thou might'st the worlds Throne haue aspired, Thou by this Peace thy war-like hart hast tamed: What greater conquest could there then be named? Sonnet 2. [But what new Sunne doth now adorne our Land] But what new Sunne doth now adorne our Land, And giues our skie so smooth and smiling cheer? For, 'tis not Phœbus; els his golden brand Shines brighter now then 't hath don many a yeer. Sweet Angel-beauty (sacred Peace) Heav'ns present; Is't not the Rising of thy new-com starr, Which makes the Air more clear, the spring more pleasant, Zephyre more calm, and Flora merrier? Ah, I perceiue the Oliue, Doue, and Bowe, Divine presages that the Flood abates (The dismal flood where blood and tears did flowe) And Ianus now locks-vp his Temple gates: Iustice and Faith doo kindly kisse each other: And Mars, appeas'd, sits down by Cupids Mother. Sonnet 3. [Fair fruitfull Daughter of th'Omnipotent] Fair fruitfull Daughter of th'Omnipotent, Great Vmpire that doost either World sustain, Without whose help all would return again (Like hidious Chaos) to confusion bent. O Mother of the liuing, second Nature Of th'Elements (Fire, Water, Earth, and Air) O Grace (whereby men climbe the heavenly stair) Whence void, this world harbours no happy creature. Pillar of Lawes, Religious pedestall, Hope of the godly, glory of th'Immortall; Honour of Cities, Pearl of Kingdoms all; Thou Nurse of Vertues, Muses chief supportall; Patron of Arts, of Good the speciall spring: All hail (deer Peace) which vs all heale doost bring. Sonnet 4. [Com forth (deer France) from thy dark Cell of mone] Com forth (deer France) from thy dark Cell of mone, Com (as new-born) from Warrs vnkindly quarrels: Turn tragick Cypresse to triumphant Laurels; Change black to green, and make thy Graue a Throne. Let Ceres dwell vpon thy Desart Plain, Bacchus, and Dian, on thy Hills and Groues, Pomona in Gardens, Pan among thy Droues, Secure all Roades, and ope all Gates again. Resume (O Cities) Rule and Reuerence; Revest (yee States) your Robes of dignitie; Rise-vp (yee Ruines) in fair Battlements; Com Muses, Pallas, Themis, Mercury, Restore vs Lawes, Learning, and Arts, and Trade: And let our Age, a golden Age be made. Sonnet 5. [Most Christian Kingdom, thou wert ne're so near] Most Christian Kingdom, thou wert ne're so near Drown'd in the deep Gulphes of thy Ciuill warre, As in the tempest of this later Iar, Which past conceit of calming did appear. When all the windes aduersly armed were, (Though selfly-foes, yet friends to work thy wrack) Thy Ship a helm, thy self a heart didst lack, On troubled waters tossed here and there: Then from aboue (O bounty most admired!) Saint Hermes shin'd: whose gentle light presageth That then the anger of the Heav'ns asswageth. O happy Peace! lesse hoped then desired: O grace much honour'd! little yet conceiv'd; O blessed guile, that thus our sense deceiv'd! Sonnet 6. [Who could expect (but past all expectation)] Who could expect (but past all expectation) So suddain order, from so sad confusion? So loyall friendship, from false emulation; So firm possession, from so fierce intrusion? Who could expect (but past all likelyhood) From such a storm, such and so sweet a calme; From France her cinders, such a Phœnix-brood; Pandoras box to yeeld so rare a balme? Who could expect (but past all humane thought) So frank a freedom from a thrall so late, Or certain Rudder of so rent a State? True Æsculapius, thou alone hast wrought This Miracle, not on Hyppolitus, But on this Kingdom, much more wonderous. Sonnet 7. [Th'vnlookt-for working of all things almost] Th'vnlookt-for working of all things almost, Inconstant-constant, in succession strange, Amazeth those whose wits we chiefly boast, To see this suddain vn-expected change. Each feels th'effect, but none the cause descries (No though he haue with starrs intelligence): God to himself reserues such Mysteries, Disposing Kingdoms by his Prouidence, O end-less Bounty! In the midst of Broyles He giues vs Peace, when Warr did vs inflame; And reaues the mischiefe we pursu'd yer-whiles: But, this doth most extoll his glorious Name, That when most sharply this extreamest Fit Stroue to be cure-less, soon he cured it. Sonnet 8. [Som reasoned thus; No violence can last] Som reasoned thus; No violence can last: Revolted Subiects, of themselues will quail: Iust Soueraignty can never be displac't; And lawfull Princes first or last preuail: But who could think, that the conioyned powers Of Spain and Rome, with an exceeding number Of rebell Cities, and false States of ours, So weak a King so little should encumber? Others discoursed in another sort, While all things sorted to another end Then their imaginations did purport: That earth may knowe, it cannot comprehend The secret depths of Iudgements all-divine, No: there's no ground, beginning, midst, nor fine. Sonnet 9. [Admire we onely Gods Omni-potence] Admire we onely Gods Omni-potence, His deep-deep Wisedom, and his Mercy deer. For, with these three, he hath surmounted heer Our hatefull foes, our hopes, and all our sense: His power appears vpon our Lord and King, As yerst on Dauid: for, they both attain By war-like broyls their preappointed Raigne; Strangers, and subiects, and selues conquering: His prudence shines, when to preserue vs thus, All humane wit his wisedom doth convince: His gracious bounty in our bountious Prince. O various wonders! mel delicious Flowes from a living Lion, Mars is quiet, Valour relenting, Conquest void of ryot. Sonnet 10. [This was no action of a humane hand] This was no action of a humane hand, But th'only work of the great Thunderer, Who (wise-directing all the things that are) In vs divinely works his owne command. Som men, vnwilling, benefit their Land, Or vn-awares their Countries good preferr; Another motions Peace, but mindeth Warr, And Peace succeeds what-ever drifts withstand. Th'Arch-Architect, the matchless Artizan All instruments vnto good vses prooues: Man's but a wheel, which that great Moover moues; Each gracious gift in that first cause began: Each good's a gleam of that first light alone, If Ill approach vs, onely that's our owne. Sonnet 11. [If God dart lightning, soon he deaws down rain] If God dart lightning, soon he deaws down rain; A dreadfull Iudge, and yet a gentle Father: Whose wrath slowe-kindled is soon quencht again, To moue vs sinners to repent the rather. 'Gainst Hel-bred Hydra, Heav'n-born Theseus brings The great Alcides arm and armory: Of greatest Ill, a greater Good there springs; And Mercy still doth Rigour qualifie. Ah France, so many Monsters to suppresse, Thou hadst great need of Royall fortitude, Els had'st thou been an Africk Wildernes. O happy lost Realm! for, it hath ensude, That now thy gain is more, in restauration, Then was thy losse in all thy desolation. Sonnet 12. [But, if I sing great Henries fortitude] But, if I sing great Henries fortitude; Shall I not then be blam'd for ouer-daring? If ouer-slip it, then be taxt for fearing, Of silent dread, and dumb ingratitude? What e're befall, my youth-bold thoughts conclude (Like Icarus) my nimble Muse to raise: And if I fall in such a Sea of praise, What rarer Mausole may my bones include? A sacred rage of som sweet-furious flame, Will-nill-I, rapts me boldly to rehearse Great Henries Tropheis, and his glorious name. Then roule thou Torrent of my tender verse: Though his high Theam deserue a consort rather Of all the Muses, and all musikes Father. Sonnet 13. [Great Prince, not pleas'd with a vain vertue-seeming] Great Prince, not pleas'd with a vain vertue-seeming: Great Victor, prone to pardon humblenes, Happy, all Hap Heav'ns onely gift esteeming; Warriour, whose warrs haue wrought his Countries Peace: Noble by deeds, and noble by descent; Ancient Achilles, youthfull Nestor sage, Whose ripe-experienç't courage confident, To knocks knits counsail, and giues rule to rage. As hard in toyle, as in compassion soft: Inur'd to that, by nature born to this; Who sheds no blood, but sheddeth tears as oft, Who neuer fights but still the Field is his. So like to Mars, that both in loues and wars, Bellona and Venus take him still for Mars. Sonnet 14. [A spirit, to vertues cheerfully addrest] A spirit, to vertues cheerfully addrest; Apt to all goodnes, to no ill inclin'd; Quick to conceiue, ingenious to digest; Whose tongue is still true trumpet of the minde: A body, resting when it hath no rest; A waxen mildnes in a steely minde; A soule tra-lucent in an open brest, Which others thoughts through boany wals can finde; Whose front reflects maiestical-humility, Whose graue-sweet look commandingly-intreats, Which in one instant fear and loue begets: A King still warring to obtain tranquillity, To saue his Country scorning thousand dangers; Mirror of Fraunce, and miracle of Strangers. Sonnet 15. [If that, before thee fall rebellious Towers] If that, before thee fall rebellious Towers, If battered Walls, before thy Souldiers, loofe; If hugest Rocks be pearced by thy powers; If 'gainst thine Armes, no armour be of proof: If that our fields flowe with Iberian blood, If that thy Camp compos'd of many a Cæsar Can by no dismall dangers be withstood; Iousting with Gyants, as it were at pleasure: If lofty Mountains to thine homage vail; If valleys rise to bulwarke thee about; If for thy sake, riuers doo flowe and fail; 'Twas neither Canons, nor our conflicts stout, Nor strength, nor stomack got these victories: No, 'twas thy presence (Henry) and thine eyes. Sonnet 16. [They be too blame then, that thy boldness blame] They be too blame then, that thy boldness blame, For hauing put thy self so oft in danger: Sith against Rebels and against the Stranger, Thy looks, like lightning, did thy Troops inflame. Fraunce fought before, all bloody, faint, and lame, Crauing thine aid to venge her hatefull wrong; When, like a Lion to preserue her yong Thou layd'st about thee to redeeme the same. Then hadst thou cause to hazard so thy life (In extream perils, extream remedies.) But spare thee now, thy State is free from strife: Soueraign, our safety in thy safety lies. Codrus could keep his, onely by his death: Thou thine, alone by thine owne liuing breath. Sonnet 17. [What wreath were worthy to becom thy Crown] What wreath were worthy to becom thy Crown, What Carr-Triumphant equall with thy worth, What marble statue meet for thy renown, Thou that hast rais'd the Lilly of the earth? What honorable Title of Addition Dost thou deserue, who (ioyning might with mildnes) Hast sav'd this great Ship from a sad perdition, Nigh lost in th'Ocean of warrs ciuill wildnes? O modern Hercules (thy Countries Father) Hope not of vs thy iust deserued meed: Earth is too-base, in Heav'n expect it rather. Our Laurels are too-pale to crown thy deed, Who thus hast salv'd the vniuersall Ball: For, th'hnalth of Fraunce imports the health of all. Sonnet 18. [Pardon me (Henry) if Heav'ns siluer raine] Pardon me (Henry) if Heav'ns siluer raine, Dewing thy pearles, impearle mine humble Laies: And if my verse (void both of price and paine) Presume thy Vertues passing-price to praise: Pardon (great King) if that mine Infant Muse Stutter thy name; and if with skill too scant Ilimne thee here, let zeale my crime excuse; My steel's attracted by thine Adamant. For, as the Sunne, although he do reflect His golden Rayes on grosser Elements, Doth neuer spot his beautifull aspect: So, though the praises of thine Excellence Doo brightly glister in my gloomy stile, They nothing lose of their first grace the while. Sonnet 19. [Now, sith as well by conquest as succession] Now, sith as well by conquest as succession France is thine owne; O keep it still therefore. 'Tis much to conquer: but, to keep possession Is full as much, and if it be not more. Who well would keep so plentifull a portion, Must stablish first the heauenly Discipline; Then humane Lawes, restraining all extortion; And Princely wealth with publike weale combine. A Princes safety lies in louing People: His Fort is Iustice (free from Stratagem) Without the which strong Cittadels are feeble. The Subiects loue is wonne by louing them: Of louing them, n'oppression is the triall: And no oppression makes them euer loyall. Sonnet 20. [Bold Martialists, braue Imps of noble birth] Bold Martialists, braue Imps of noble birth, Shining in steele for France, and for your King: Ye Sons of those that heretofore did bring Beneath their yoake the pride of all the earth. It is an honour to be high-descended; But more, t'haue kept ones Country and fidelitie. For, our owne vertues make vs most commended: And Truth's the title of all true Nobility. Your shoulders shoar'd vp France (euen like to fall) You were her Atlas; Henry, Hercules: And but for you, her shock had shaken All; But now she stands stedfast on Ciuill Peace: Wherefore, if yet your war-like heat doo work, With holy Armes goe hunt the hatefull Turk. Sonnet 21. [But you that vaunt your antike Pedigrees] But you that vaunt your antike Pedigrees, So stately timbring your surcharged shields, Perking (like Pines aboue the lower Trees) Ouer the Farmers of your neighbour fields; Is't lack of loue, or is it lack of courage, That holds you (Snaile-like) creeping in your houses, While ouer all your Countries Foes doo forrage, And rebell out-rage euery corner rouses? If no example of your Ancesters, Nor present instance of bright-armed Lords, The feeble Temper of your stomack stirres, If in your liues yee neuer drew your swords To serue your King, nor quench your Countries flames, Pardon me, Nobles, I mistooke your names. Sonnet 22. [You sacred Order, charg'd the church to watch] You sacred Order, charg'd the church to watch, And teach the holy Mysteries of Heav'n, From hence-forth all seditious plots dispatch, And (Father-like) to all be alwaies euen. Though superstition stirre to strife againe; Reuolt's a mischiefe euermore pernicious: Pluck vp abuses, and the hurtfull graine Sprung from the Ignorant and Auaricious. Auoid Ambition (common cause of strife) Your reuerend Robe be free from staines of blood, Preach holy Doctrine, prooue it by your life: Fly Idlenes, choose exercises good; To wit, all works of liuely faith and pietie. So, to your Fold shall flock the blest Societie. Sonnet 23. [You graue assembly of sage Senators] You graue assembly of sage Senators, Right Oracles, yee Ephori of France; Who, for the States and Iustice maintenance, Of Sword and Balance are the Arbitrers: That from hence-forth (against all enemies) Our Peace may seat her in a settled Throne; Represse the malice of all mutinies, Which through th'aduantage of these times haue growne. At a lowe tyde 'tis best to mend a breach, Before the flood returne with violence: 'Tis good in health to counsaile with a Leach: So, while a People's calme from insolence, 'Tis best that Rulers bridle them with awe; And (for the future) curbe the lewd with law. Sonnet 24. [People, lesse settled then the sliding sand] People, lesse settled then the sliding sand; More mutable then Proteus, or the Moone; Turn'd, and return'd, in turning of a hand: Like Euripus ebbe-flowing euery Noone. Thou thousand-headed head-less Monster-most, Oft slaine (like Antheus) and as oft new rising, Who, hard as steele, as light as winde art tost; Chameleon like, each obiects colour prysing: Vnblinde thy blinde soule, ope thine inward sight; Be no more Tinder of intestine flame: Of all fantastike humors purge thy spright: For, if past-follie's vrge yet griefe and shame, Lo (like Obliuions law) to cure thy passion, State-stabling Peace brings froward minds in fashion. Sonnet 25. [Engins of Vulcan, Heav'n-affrighting wonders] Engins of Vulcan, Heav'n-affrighting wonders, Like brittle glasse the Rocks to cindars breaking; Deafning the windes, dumbing the loudest thunders; May ye be bound a thousand yeeres from speaking. Yee hate-peace Hacksters flesht in Massacres, Be you for euer banisht from our soile; Yee steeled Tooles of slaughter, wounds, and warres, Be you condemn'd to hang, and rust a while: Or (not to languish in so fruit-less rest) Be you transform'd to husband furniture, To plow those fields you haue so oft deprest: Or (if you cannot leaue your wonted vre) Leaue (at the least) all mutinous alarmes, And be from hence-forth Iustice lawfull Armes. Sonnet 26. [O Paris, knowe thy selfe, and knowe thy Master] O Paris, knowe thy selfe, and knowe thy Master, As well thy heav'nly as thine earthly guider: And be not like a Horse, who (proud of pasture) Breakes Bit, and Reanes, and casts his cunning Rider. Who nill be Subiects, shall be slaues in fine: Who Kings refuse, shall haue a Tyrant Lord: Who are not moov'd with the milde rods diuine, Shall feele the fury of Heav'ns venging Sword. Thy greatnes stands on theirs that weare the Crowne, Whereof, th'hast had now seuentie (sauing seuen). Thinke one sufficient soone to pull thee downe: Kings greatnes stands on the great King of Heav'n. Knowing these two, then Paris knowe thy selfe, By Warres afflictions, and by Peaces wealth. Sonnet 27. [Swell not in pride, O Paris (Princely Dame)] Swell not in pride, O Paris (Princely Dame) To be chiefe Citie, and thy Soueraines Throne: Citie? nay modell of this totall Frame, A mighty Kingdom of thy selfe alone. The scourge that lately with paternall hand For thine amendment did so mildely beat-thee, If any more against thy Kings thou stand, Shall proue that then God did but only threat-thee. Wert thou a hundred thousand-fold more mighty, Who in th'Olympike Court commands the thunders, In his least wrath can wrack thee (most Almighty). Thebes, Babel, Rome, those proud heav'n-daring wonders, Lowe vnder ground in dust and ashes lie: For earthly Kingdoms (euen as men) doe die. Sonnet 28. [But, O my sorrowes! whither am I tost?] But, O my sorrowes! whither am I tost? What? shall I bloody sweet Astræas Songs? Re-open wounds that are now heal'd almost, And new-remember nigh forgotten wrongs? Sith stormes are calmed by a gentle Starre, Forget we (Muse) all former furie-moods, And all the tempests of our viper-Warre: Drown we those thoughts in deep-deep Lethe floods. O but (alas) I cannot not-retaine So great, notorious, common miseries, Nor hide my plaint, nor hold my weeping raine: But 'mid these hidious hellish out-rages, I'le showe and prooue by this strange spectacle, Our ciuill Peace, a sacred Miracle. Sonnet 29. [As he that, scap't from Ship-wrack on a plank] As he that, scap't from Ship-wrack on a plank, Doubts of his health, and hardly yet beleeues (Still faintly shiuering on the feareless bank) That (through that fraile helpe) certainely he liues: As he that new freed from strange seruitude, Returnes again to tread his natiue allies, Seems still to feare his Patrons rigour rude, And seems still tugging, chained in the Gallies: So alwayes, ruth, ruine, and rage, and horror Of troubles past doo haunt me euery-where, And still I meete Furies and gastly Terror: Then, to my selfe thus raue I (rapt with feare) From pleasures past, if present sorrow spring, Why should not past cares present comfort bring? Sonnet 30. [We must not now vpbraid each others crimes] We must not now vpbraid each others crimes Committed wrongly in the time of warre; For we haue all (alas) too often-times Prouok't the vengeance of the Lord too farre: Some robbing Iustice, vnder maske of Reason; Some blowing coles, to kindle-vp Sedition; Some 'gainst their King attempting open Treason; Some Godding Fortune (Idol of Ambition). Alas, we knowe our cause of maladie, All apt t'accuse, but none to cleanse th'impure; Each doth rebuke, but none doth remedy: To knowe a griefe, it is but halfe a cure. Is it our sinnes? let's purge away that bane; Eor what helps Physicke, if it be not tane? Sonnet 31. [Who cloake their crimes in hoods of holines] Who cloake their crimes in hoods of holines, Are double villaines: and the Hypocrite Is most-most odious in Gods glorious sight, That takes his Name to couer wickednes. Profane Ambition, blinde and irreligious, In quest of Kingdoms, holding nothing holy Think'st thou th'Eternall blinde (as thou in folly) Or weake to punish Monsters so prodigious? O execrable vizard, canst thou hide thee From th'All-pierce Eye? Are treason, rape, and murder Effects of Faith, or of the Furies-order? Thy vaile is rent, the rudest haue discride thee. Sonnet 32. ['Tis now apparant to each plaine Opinion] 'Tis now apparant to each plaine Opinion, Thy hot Deuotion hunted but Dominion. 'Tis strange to see the heat of Ciuill brands. For, when we arme vs brother against brother, O then how ready are our hearts and hands, And Wits awake to ruine one another! But, come to counter-mine 'gainst secret treason, Or force the forces of a stranger foe, Alas, how shallow are we then in reason, How cold in courage, and in camping slowe! Fraunce only striues to triumph ouer Fraunce: With selfe-kill Swords to cut each others throat. What swarmes of Soldiers euery where doo float, To spend and spoile a Kingdoms maintenance? But, said I Soldiers? ah, I blush for shame, To giue base Theeues the noble Soldiers name. Sonnet 33. [Is't not an endless scandall to our dayes] Is't not an endless scandall to our dayes (If possible our heirs can credit it) That th'holy name of Peace, so worthy praise, Hath been our Watch-word for a fault vnfit? That the pure Lilly, our owne natiue flower, Hath been an odious obiect in our eyes? That kingly Name, and Kings heav'n-stablisht power, Hath been with vs a marke of trecheries? T'haue banisht hence the godly and the wise, Whose sound direction kept the State from danger; Yea, made their bodies bloody Sacrifice? And (to conclude) seeking to serue a Stranger, T'haue stabd our owne? but (O Muse) keep that in: The fault's so foul, to speak it were a sinne. Sonnet 34. [I waile not I so much warres wastefull rigours] I waile not I so much warres wastefull rigours, Nor all thy ruines make me halfe so sorie, As thy lost honor (France) which most disfigures, Losing thy loyalty, thy Natiue glory. From Moores to Muscouites (O cursed change!) The French are called, Faith-less Parricides: Th'yerst-most-prince-loyall people (O most strange!) Are now Prince-treachers more than all besides: With vs, Massacres passe for Pietie; Theft, rape, and wrong, for iust-attaind possessions: Reuolt for Merit, Rage for Equity: Alas, must we needs borrow the transgressions And imperfections of all other Nations, Yerst onely blamed for inconstant fashions? Sonnet 35. [Not without reason hath it oft been spoken] Not without reason hath it oft been spoken, That through faire Concord little things augment, And (opposite) that mightiest things are broken Through th'vgly Discord of the discontent. When many tunes doe gently symphonize It conquers hearts, and kindly them compounds; When many hearts doe gently sympathize In sacred friendship, there all blisse abounds. Alas, if longer we diuide this Realme, Loosing to euery Partizan apart; Farewell our Lillies and our Diadem. For, though it seeme to breath now somwhat peart, Our sinnes (I feare) will worke worse after-claps: And ther's most danger in a re-re-relapse. Sonnet 36. [O, how I hate these partia-lizing words] O, how I hate these partia-lizing words, Which show how we are in the Faith deuised: Is't possible to whet so many Swords, And light such flames 'mong th'In-one-Christ-baptized: Christians to Christians to be brute and bloudy, Altars to Altars to be opposite, Parting the limmes of such a perfect Body, While Turks with Turks do better farre vnite? We, in our Truth finde doubts (whence follow Schismes) They, whose fond Law doth all of Lies consist, Abide confirm'd in their vaine Paganismes. One nought beleeues, another what him list: One ouer-Creeds, another Creeds too-short; Each makes his Church (rather his Sect) a-part. Sonnet 37. [Put-off (deere French) all secret grudge and gall] Put-off (deere French) all secret grudge and gall, And all keen stings of vengeance on all parts:. For if you would haue Peace proclaim'd to all, It must be first faire printed in your hearts. Henry the mildest of all Conquerers (Your perfect Glasse for Princely clemencie) He, to appease and calme the State from iarres, For his friends sake, hath sav'd his enemie. Let's all be French, all subiects to one Lord; Let France from hence-forth be one onely State; Let's all (for Gods sake) be of one accord. So (through true zeale Christs praise to propagate) May the most Christian King with prosperous power On Sion walls re-plant our Lilly-flower. Sonnet 38. [O christian cor'siue! that the Mahomite] O christian cor'siue! that the Mahomite With hundred thousands in Vienna Plaine, His mooned Standards hath already pight, Prest to ioyne Austrich to his Thracian Raigne: Malth, Corfu, Candie, his proud Threats disdaine; And all our Europe trembles in dismay; While striuing Christians (by each other slaine) Each other weak'ning make him easie waie. Khodes, Belgrade, Cyprus, and the Realmes of Greece, Thrall'd to his barbarous yoake, yet fresh-declare, That while two striue, a third obtaines the fleece. Though name of Christian be a title faire; If, but for Earth, they all this while haue striv'n, They may haue Earth, but others shall haue Heav'n. Sonnet 39. [May I not one day see in France againe] May I not one day see in France againe Some new Martellus (full of stout actiuity) To snatch the Scepter from the Saracen, That holds the Holy Land in strait captiuitie? May I not see the selfe-weale-wounding Launce Of our braue Bloods (yerst one another goring) Turn'd with more valour on the Musulmans, A higher pitch of happy prowesse soaring? But who (deare Fraunce) of all thy men-at-armes Shall so farre hence renue their ancient Laurels: Sith here they plot thine and their proper harmes? I rather feare, that (through their fatall quarrels) That hate-Christ Tyrant will in time become The Lord and Soueraigne of all Christendome. Sonnet 40. [Mid all these mischiefes, while the friend-foe Strangers] Mid all these mischiefes, while the friend-foe Strangers, With vs, against vs, had intelligence; Henry our King, our Father, voides our dangers, And (O Heav'ns wonder) planteth Peace in Fraunce. Thou Iudge that sitt'st on the supernall Throne, O quench thy fury, keep vs from hostilitie: With eyes of mercy looke thou still vpon Our Peace, and found it on a firme stabilitie: Sith (in despight of discord) thou alone, Inward and outward, hast thus salv'd vs (Lord) Keep still our Fraunce (or rather Lord thine owne) Let Princes loue, and liue in iust accord: Dis-arme them (Lord) or, if Armes busie them, Be it alone for thy Ierusalem. FINIS. A DIALOGVE VPON THE TROVBLES PAST: Betweene Heraclitvs and Democritvs, the weeping and the laughing Philosophers. Heraclitus. Alas! thou laugh'st, perhaps not feeling well The painfull torments of this mortall Hell: Ah! canst thou (tear-less) in this iron Age, See men massacred, Monsters borne to rage? Democritus. Ha! but why weep'st thou? wherefore in this sort Doost thou lament amid this merry sport? Ha! canst thou chuse but laugh, to see the State Of mens now-follies, and the freaks of Fate? Heraclitus. He hath no heart that melts not all in teares, To see the treasons, murders, massacres, Sacks, sacrileges, losses and alarmes Of those that perish by their proper armes. Democritus. Who all dismaied, swouneth sodainly To heare or see some fained Tragedy (Held in these dayes, on euery Stage as common) Is but a heartless man, or but a woman. Heraclitus. O! would to God our Countries tragick ruth Were but a fable, no effected truth: My soule then should not sigh to angry Heav'n, Nor for her plagues my tender heart be riv'n. Democritus. I take the world to be but as a Stage, Where net-maskt men do play their personage: 'Tis but a mummerie, and a pleasant showe; Sith ouer all, strange vanities doo flowe. Heraclitus. Those vanities I haue in detestation, As cursed causes of Gods indignation: Which makes me alwaies weep, sith on the earth I see no obiect for the meanest mirth. Democritus. Thus, from one Subiect sundry sequels spring, As diuersly our wits conceiue a thing. I laugh to see thee weepe; thou weep'st to see Me laugh so much, which more afflicteth thee. Heraclitus. Laugh while thou list at mortall miseries, I cannot chuse but euen weep out mine eyes: Finding more cause for tears in bloody slaughter Then for thy sense-less ill-beseeming laughter. Democritus, Melt thee, distill thee, turne to waxe or snowe; Make sad thy gesture, tune thy voice to woe; I cannot weep, except sometimes it hap Through laughing much, mine eyes let fall a drop. Heraclitus. I weep to see thus euerie thing confused, Order disordred, and the Lawes abused; Iustice reuerst and Policie peruerted; And this sicke State neere vtterly subuerted. Democritus. I laugh to see how Fortune (like a ball) Playes with the Globe of this inconstant All; How she degradeth these, and graceth those; How whom she lifts-vp, downe again she throwes. Heraclitus. I raine downe Riuers, when against their King Cities rebell, through subiects bandying: When Colledges through Armes) are reft of Art: When euery County Kingdomes-it a-part. Democritus. I burst with laughter, when (confounding State) I see those rebels hunt their Magistrate; When I heare Porters prate of State-designes, And make all common, as in new-found Indes. Heraclitus. I weep to see Gods glory made a vaile To couer who his glorie most assaile: That sacred Faith is made a maske for sinne, And men runne headlong to destructions ginne. Democritus. I laugh (with all my heart) at the transforming Of Iuggling Proteis, to all times Conforming: But, most I laugh, t'haue seene the world so mad To starue and die, when those damn'd Atheists bad. Heraclitus. I weepe (alas) to see the people weepe, Opprest with rest-less waight in danger deepe; Crying for Peace, but yet not like to get-her, Yet her condition is not greatly better. Democritus. I laugh to see all cause of laughter gone, Through those which (yerst thou said'st) haue caus'd thy mone: Noting th'old guise, I laugh at all their new: I laugh at more, but dare not tell it you. Heraclitus. Som sorrowes also I in silence keepe; But in the Desart, all my woes shall weepe: And there (perhaps) the Rocks will helpe me then; For, in these dayes they are more milde then men. Democritus. I'le dwell in Cities (as my Genius guides) To laugh my fill; for, smiling Peace prouides Such plentious store of laughing-stuffe to fill me, That still I'le laugh, vn-less that laughing kill me. FINIS. AN ODE OF THE LOVE AND BEAVTIES OF ASTRÆA. TO THE MOST MATCHLESS. faire and vertuous, M.M.H. Tetrastichon. Thou, for whose sake my freedome I forsake; Who, murdring me dost yet maintain my life: Heere, vnder Peace, thy beauties Type I make, Faire, war-like Nymph, that keep'st me still in strife. AN ODE TO ASTRÆA. Sacred Peace, if I approue thee, If more then my life I loue thee, 'Tis not for thy beautious eyes: Though the brightest Lampe in skies In his highest Sommer-shine, Seems a sparke compar'd with thine, With thy paire of selfe-like-Sunnes, Past all else-comparisons. 'Tis not (deere) the dewes Ambrosiall Of those pretie lips so Rosiall, Make me humble at thy feet: Though the purest honey sweet That the Muses birds do bring, To Mount Hybla euery spring, Nothing neere so pleasant is, As thy liuely louing kisse. 'Tis not (Beauties Emperesse) Th'Amber circlets of thy tresse; Curled by the wanton windes, That so fast my freedom bindes: Though the pretious glittering sand Richly strow'd on Tagus Strand, Nor the graines Pactolus rol'd, Neuer were so fine a gold. 'Tis not for the polisht rowes Of those Rocks whence Prudence flowes, That I still my sute pursue; Though that in those Countries new In the Orient lately found (Which in precious Gemmes abound) 'Mong all baytes of Auarice Be no Pearles of such a price. 'Tis not (Sweet) thine yuorie neck Makes me worship at thy beck; Nor that prettie double Hill Of thy bosome panting still: Though no fairest Lædas Swan, Nor no sleekest Marble can Be so smooth or white in showe, As thy Lillies, and thy Snowe. 'Tis not (O my Paradise) Thy front (euener than the yee) That my yeelding heart doth tye With his mild-sweet Maiestie: Though the siluer Moone be faine Still by night to mount her waine, Fearing to sustain disgrace, If by day shee meet thy face. 'Tis not that soft Sattin limme, With blew trailes enameld trimme, Thy hand, handle of perfection, Keeps my thoughts in thy subiection: Though it haue such curious cunning, Gentle touch, and nimble running, That on Lute to heare it warble, Would mooue Rocks and rauish Marble. 'Tis not all the rest beside, Which thy modest vaile doth hide From mine eyes (ah too iniurious!) Makes me of thy loue so curious: Though Diana being bare, Nor Leucothoe passing rare, In the Crystall-flowing springs Neuer bath'd so beautious things. What then (O diuinest Dame) Fires my soule with burning flame, If thine eyes be not the matches Whence my kindling Taper catches? And what Nectar from aboue Feeds and feasts my ioyes (my Loue) If they taste not of the dainties Of thy sweet lips sugred plenties? What fell heat of couetize In my feeble bosome fries; If my heart no reckoning hold Of thy tresses purest gold? What inestimable treasure Can procure me greater pleasure Then those Orient Pearles I see When thou daign'st to smile on mee? What? what fruit of life delights My delicious appetites, If I ouer-passe the messe Of those apples of thy brests? What fresh buds of scarlet Rose Are more fragrant sweet than those, Then those Twins thy Straw-berrie teates, Curled-purled Cherrylets? What (to finish) fairer limme, Or what member yet more trimme, Or what other rather Subiect Makes me make thee all mine obiect? If it be not all the rest By thy modest vaile supprest (Rather) which an enuious cloud From my sight doth closely shroud. Ah 't is a thing more diuine, 'Tis that peere-less Soule of thine, Master-peece of Heav'ns best Art, Made to maze each mortall heart. 'Tis thine all-admired wit, Thy sweet grace and gesture fit, Thy milde pleasing curtesie Makes thee triumph ouer me. But, for thy faire Soules respect, I loue Twin-flames that reflect From thy bright tra-lucent eyes: And thy yellow lockes likewise: And those Orient-Pearly Rocks Which thy lightning Smile vn-lockes: And the Nectar-passing blisses Of thy honey-sweeter kisses. I loue thy fresh rosie cheeke, Blushing most Aurora-like: And the white-exceeding skin Of thy neck and dimpled chin, And those Iuorie-marble mounts Either, neither, both at once: For, I dare not touch, to know If they be of flesh or no. I loue thy pure Lilly hand Soft, and smooth, and slender: and Those fiue nimble brethren small Arm'd with Pearle-shel helmets all. I loue also all the rest By thy modest vaile supprest (Rather) which an enuious cloud From my longing sight doth shroud. FINIS. Sonnet 1. Sweet mouth, that send'st a musky-rosed breath; Fountain of Nectar, and delightfull Balm; Eyes clowdy-clear, smile-frowning, stormy-calm; Whose every glance darts me a living-death: Browes, bending quaintly your round Ebene Arks: Smile, that then Venus sooner Mars besots; Locks more then golden, curl'd in curious knots, Where, in close ambush wanton Cupid lurks: Grace Angel-like; fair fore-head, smooth, and high; Pure white, that dimm'st the Lillies of the Vale; Vermilion Rose, that mak'st Aurora pale: Rare spirit, to rule this beautious Emperie: If in your force, Divine effects I view, Ah, who can blame me, if I worship you? Sonnet 2. Thou, whose sweet eloquence doth make me mute; Whose sight doth blinde me; and whose nimbleness Of feet in dance, and fingers on the Lute, In deep amazes makes me motion-less: Whose onely presence from my selfe absents me; Whose pleasant humours, make me passionate; Whose sober moods my follies represent me; Whose graue-milde graces make me emulate: My heart, through whom, my heart is none of mine; My All, through whom, I nothing do possess Saue thine Idea, glorious and divine: O thou my Peace-like War, and war-like Peace, So much the wounds that thou hast giuen me, please, Thst't is my best ease never to have ease. EPIGRAMS &amp; EPITAPHES vpon Warre and Peace. Vpon the League. France, without cause thou doost complain Against the League for wronging thee. Sh' hath made thee large amends again, With more then common vsurie: For, for thy one King which she slew, Sh' hath given thee now a thousand new. Vpon the taking of Paris. 1 When Paris (happily) was wonne With small or no endangering, Such sudden common ioy begunne, That one would say (t'haue seen the thing) Th'King took not Paris, Paris took the King. 2 O rarest sight of ioyfull woe, Adorned with delightfull dread; When Henry with one selfe-same showe, Conquer'd at once and triumphed! 3 Sith thee from danger and distress to free, The King thus took, or rather entred thee; Paris, it was not in stern Mars his Moneth, But in the month that mild Astræa owneth. Vpon the fall of the Millars-bridge. 1 The Millars, in the River drown'd, While Paris was beleaguerd round; To die were all resolv'd in minde, Because they had no more to grinde. 2 Then was their fittest time to die, Because they might intend it best: But their intent was contrary, Because they then liv'd so at rest. 3 As, after long sharp famine, som (forlorn) Of surfet Die, their greediness is such: This Mill-bridge, having fasted long from corn, Is drown'd (perhaps) for having ground too-much. Vpon the recouerie of Amiens. [1] I know not which may seem most admirable; To take or re-take such a Cities force: But, yet I knowe which is most honourable, To take by fraud, or to re-take by force. 2 Each where they sing a thousand waies The glorie of this enterprise: But yet of all their merry Layes, The best is still in the Re-prise. 3 Hernand was happy by this Enterprise, To take so soon our Amiens without blowe: More happy yet, to die yer the Re-prise, Else had he dy'd for shame to leaue it so. Vpon the Reduction of Nantes. Nantes would not yeeld so soon (they sayd) Nor be recovered so good cheap: And yet, for all defence it made, 'T was made to make the Britton Leap. Vpon Peace. 1 Souldiers, late prest, are now supprest; Crost and cassierd from further pay: Yet will they (in this time of rest) Take vp their lendings by the Way. 2 This Peace (it seemeth) doth not sound To all the world; for, every-where More Sergeants now do goe the Round, Then Souldiers yerst accustom'd were. Vpon Captaine Cobbler. A merry Cobbler left the wars, To turn vnto his Occupation: And, asked by his Customers The reason of his alteration: 'T hath pleas'd (quoth he) the King t'ordain That each his office take again. Vpon Warre. Heere, vnder this huge heap of stones Lately enterr'd lies cruell Warre: Pray God long rest her soule and bones Yet, there is nothing worse for her. Vpon Rowland Rob-Church. Heer lyeth Rowland, that was lately slain, In robbing of a wealthy Chappell, spyde: Yet I beleeue he doth in heav'n remain, Sith onely for the Churches Good he dyde. Vpon Captaine Catch. Heer vnder, Captain Catch is layd, Who six times chang'd from side to side; Of neither side (it seem'd) afraid: He wore a white Scarfe when he dyde: Yet som suspect (and so do I) For his inconstance showen before, That to the Black-band he did fly: But now he can reuolt no more. Vpon Sir Nequam Neuter. Heer lyeth he, who the more safe to prey On both sides; Neuter, between both abode: Whither his Soule is gone, I cannot say, Sith he was, nor for Diuell, nor for God. Pax omnibus vna. FINIS. THE PROFIT OF IMPRISONMENT. A PARADOX, WRITTEN IN FRENCH BY Odet de la Noue, Lord of Teligni, being Prisoner in the Castle of Tourney. Translated by Iosvah Sylvester. TO HIS LONG APPROVED friend, M. R. Nicolson I. S. wisheth euer all true content. To thee (the same to me as first I meant) Friend to the Muses, and the well-inclinde, Louing, and lov'd of euery vertuous minde: To thee the same, I the same Song present (Our mutuall loue's eternall Monument) Wherein, our Nephewes shall heer-after finde Our constant Friendship how it was combinde With links of kindness and acknowledgement. Accept againe this Present in good part, This simple pledge of my sincere affection To Tangley, Thee, and thy Soon-calm-in-heart (Perfect good-will supplies all imperfection). Chameleons change their colour: Guile her game: But (in both Fortunes) Vertue's still the same. A SONNET OF THE Author to his Booke. The Bodie ouer-prone to Pleasures and delights Of soft, frail, dainty flesh, and to self-ease addicted, Abhors Imprisonment, as a base paine inflicted To punish the defaults of most vnhappy wights. The Soule, as much surpriz'd with loue of heauenly sights, And longing to behold the place that appertaines-her, Doth loath the Bodie, as a Prison that detaines-her From her high happiness among the blessed sprights. Then, sith both Bodie and Soule their bondage neuer brook, But Soule and Bodie both doo loue their liberty: Tell, tell me (O my Muse) who will beleeue our Book? He that hath learn'd a-right both these to mortifie, And serue our Sauiour Christ in bodie and in spirit, Who both from thrall hath freed by his owne only merit. A PARADOX, THAT ADVERSITY IS MORE necessary then Prosperity; and that, of all afflictions, Close-Prison is most pleasant, and most profitable. How-ever fondly-false a vaine Opinion seem; If but the Vulgar once the same for right esteem, Most men account it so: so (in absurdest things) Consent of multitude exceeding credit brings. Nor any mean remaines when it is once receiued, To wrest it from the most of erring mindes deceiued. Nay, whoso shall but say, they ought to alter it, He headlong casts himselfe in dangers deepest Pit. For never nimble Barke that on aduenture runs Through those blew bounding Hils where hoary Neptune wuns, Was set-vpon so sore with never-ceast assault Maintain'd on every side by windes and waters salt, When, raging most, they raise their roughest tempest dreaded, As th'idiot multitude, that Monster many-headed Bestirres it selfe, with wrath, spight, fury, full of terror, 'Gainst whatsoever man that dares reprove her error. Who vndertakes that taske, must make account (at first) To take hot wars in hand, and beare away the worst. Therefore a many Works (worthy the light) haue died Before their birth, in brests of Fathers terrified, Not by rough deeds alone; but even by foolish threats: Yet onely noyse of words base cowards only beats. Then feare who list (for me) the common peoples cry, And whoso list, be mute, if otherminded: I (Scorning the feeble force of such a vain indeavour) Will freely (spight of feare) say, what I censure ever: And, though my present State permit me not such scope, Mine vn-forbidden pen with Errors pride shall cope. Close Prison (now a-dayes) th'extreamest miserie The world doth deem, I deem direct the contrarie: And there-with-all will prove, that even Aduersities Are to be wished more then most Prosperities. And, for Imprisonment, though that be most lamented, Of all the griefes where with men feare to be tormented; Yet, that's the State most stor'd with pleasure and delight, And the most gainfull too to any Christian wight. A Paradox, no doubt more true, then creditable; The which my selfe somtimes haue also thought a fable, While guile-full vanities, fed not, but fill'd my minde, For strengthening sustenance, with vn-substantiall winde. I hated Death to death, I also did detest All sickness and disease that might a man molest. But most I did abhorre that base esteemed state, Which to subiections Law our selves doth subiugate, And our sweet life enthrals vnto anothers will: For, as my fancy wisht I would haue walked still. Death (thought I) soon hath done, and every griefe besides, The more extream it is, the lesser time abides: But now, besides that I esteem'd the prisoners trouble Much worse, me thought the time his martyrdom did double. So that, to scape that scourge, so irksom to my hart, I could haue been content to suffer any smart. Lo, by blind ignorance how iudgements are mis-led: Now that full thirtie months I have experienced That so-much-feared ill, 'tis now so vs'd to me, That I (a prisoner) liue much more content and free, Then when as (vnder cloake of a false freedom vain) I was base slaue (indeed) to many a bitter pain. But, now I see my selfe mockt every-where almost, And feeble me alone met by a mightie hoast Of such, as (in this case) doo not conceiue as I, But doo esteem themselues offended much thereby. And therefore (Father deer) this weake abortiue Childe, For refuge runs between th'armes of his Grand-sire milde. If you accept of it, my labour hath his hire: For, careless of the rest, all that I heer desire, Is onely that your selfe (as in a Glasse) may see The Image of th'estate of my Captivity: Where, though I nothing can availe the Common-weale, Yet I availe my selfe (at least) some little deale; Praising th'all powerfull Lord, that thus vouchsafes to poure Such favours manifold vpon me every houre; Wherof your self (yet while) so sweet sure proof haue tasted, In cruell bitterness of bands that longer lasted. Now, I beseech his Grace to blesse mine enterprise, My heart and hand at once to gouern in such wise, That what I write, may nought displeasing him containe: For, voyd of his sweet aide, who works he works in vaine. Within the wide-spred space of these round Elements, Whatever is indewd with living soule and sense, Seeks (of it selfe) selfe-good; this instinct naturall Nature her selfe hath grauen in hearts of Creatures all: And, of all liuing things (from largest to the least) Eeach one to flie his ill doth euermore his best. Thereof it comes (we see) the wilde Horse (full of strength) Tamely to take the bit into his mouth at length; And so, by force we tame each most vntamed beast, Which, of it selfe, discreet, of euils takes the least: And though that that which seems to be his chiefe restraint He often-times despise, that's by a worse constraint: As, when the Lion fierce, feare-lesse pursues the shining Of bright keen-pearcing blades, and's royal crest declining, Full of the valiant Fire, that courage woonts to lend, Runnes midst a million swords, his whelpling's to defend, More fearing farre that they their liberty should lose, Than on himselfe the smart of thousand wounding blowes. But, all things haue not now the selfe same goods and ils; What helpeth one, the same another hurts and kils: There's ods between the good that sauage Beasts do like, And that good (good indeed) which soule-wise man must seek: When Beasts haue store of food; and free from foe's annoy, Smartlesse, and sound, and safe, may (as they list) enioy Their fill of thóse delights, that most delight the sense; That, that's the happiness that fully them contents: But reasonable soules (as God hath made mankind) Can with so wretched Good not satisfie their mind. But by how much the more their inly sight excels The brutish appetite of euery creature els, So much more excellent the good for which they thirst. Man of two parts is made: the body is the worst, The Heav'n-born soule, the best, wherein mans blisse abides; In body that of beasts, nought hauing els besides; This body stands in need of many an accessorie, To make it somewhat seem: the soule receiues this glory, That selfly she subsists; and her aboundant wealth (Vnlike the bodies store) is euer safe from stealth. Our body took his birth of this terrestriall clod: Our spirit, it was inspir'd of th'inly breath of God; And either of them still striues to his proper place, This (earth-born) stoopes to earth; that sties to heauen apace. But, as the silly bird, whose wings are wrapt in lime, Faine (but in vaine) attempts to flie full many a time: So, our faire soule, surcharg'd with this foule robe of mud, Is too-too often held from mounting to her Good. She striues, she strikes, somtimes she lifts her vp aloft: But as the worser part (we see) preuaileth oft, This false fraile flesh of ours, with pleasure's painted lure, Straight makes her stoop againe downe to the dust impure. Happy who th'honour hath of such a victory: He crowns his conquering head with more true maiesty Then if he had subdued those Nations, by his might, Which doo discouer first Aurora's early light, And those whom Phœbus sees from his Meridian Mount, Th'Anti-podes, and all; more then the sand to count. For, small the honour is to be acknowledg'd King And Monarke of the world, ones selfe vn-mastering. But, each man on his head this Garland cannot set, Nor is it giuen to all this victorie to get. Onely a very few (Gods deere-belov'd Elect) This happy Goale haue got by Vertues lyue effect: The rest, soon weary of this same so painfull War, Like well of Heauen, but loue the earth aboue it far: Some, drunk with poysony dregs of worldly pleasures brute, Know where true good consists, but neuer doo ensue't: Some doo ensue the same, but with so faint a heart, That at the first assault they doo retire and start: Some, more courageous, vow more then they bring to passe (So much more easie 'tis to say, then doo, alas) And all, through too-much loue of this vaine worlds allurements, Or too-much idle feare of sufferings and endurements: Meere vanities, whereto the more men doo incline, The farther-off they are from their chiefe Good diuine. Therefore, so many think themselues so miserable: Therefore the aire is fill'd with out-cries lamentable Of such as doo disdaine the thing that better is, To entertaine the worse, with forfeit of their blisse: Therefore we see those men that riches doo possesse, Afflicted still with care: and therefore heauinesse Abandons neuer those, that, fed with honours fill, Fawne vpon Potentates, for flitting fauours still. And, cause (God wot) they haue, to be at quiet neuer, Sith their felicitie is so vncertaine euer. Neither are Kings themselues exempted from vexation, How-euer Soueraine sway they beare in any Nation: For, now they wish to win, anon feare losse no lesse. Yea, though (for Empire) they did this wide world possesse, Not one of them, withall, could full contented be: For, how man more attaines, the more attempteth he. Who (therefore) couets most such soon-past goods vncertain, Shall ne'r enioy the ioy of goods abiding certain: But, whoso seeks to build a true content, to last, On else-what must else-where his first foundation cast. For all things here belowe are apt to alter euer; Here's nothing permanent: and therefore whosoeuer Trusts thereto, trusteth to a broken staffe for stay; For no earth's vanity can blesse a man for aye. We must, to make vs blest, our firme assurance found Els-where then in this world, this change-inthralled ground: We must propose our selues that perfect, perish-less, That true vnfained good, that good all danger-less From th'vniust spoile of theeues, which neuer, neuer stands In need of guard, to guard from Souldiers pilling, hands. Now, 'tis with spirituall hands and not with corporall, That we doo apprehend these heauenly treasures all: Treasures so precious, that th'onely hope to haue-them In full fruition once, with him that frankly gaue-them, Fills vs with euery ioy, our sorrowes choaks and kills, And makes vs feele, amid our most tormenting ills, A much more calme content, then those that euery day On this fraile earth inioy their hearts wish euery way. It's therefore in the spirit, not in the flesh that we Must seeke our Soueraigne Good and chiefe Felicitie. Th'one is not capable of any iniurie: Th'other's thrall to th'yoak of many a miserie: Th'one end-less, euer-lasts: th'other endures so little, That wel-nigh yer't be got, 'tis gone, it is so brittle. For, who is he that now in wealth aboundeth most, Or, he that in the Court Kings fauours best may boast, Or, he that's most with robes of dignity bedight, Or, he that swimmes on Seas of sensuall sweet delight, But is in perill still to proue the contrarie, Poore, hated, honour-less, and full of misery? But, one, that scorning all these rich proud pomps and pleasures About him (Bias like) beares alwaies all his treasures, Euen (like to him) can leaue his natiue Country sackt Without sustaine of losse; and, with a mind infract, Euen vanquished bereaue the victors victories, Who, though his Land he win, cannot his hart surprise. Let exile, prisonment, and tortures great and small, With their extreamest paines at-once assaile him all: Let him be left alone among his mighty foes, Poore, friendless, naked, sick (or if ought worse then those) He doth not onely beare all this with patience, But taketh (euen) delight in such experience, Regarding all these griefes, which men so much affright, As Baby-fearing buggs, and scar-crowes void of might: He chooseth rather much such exercise as these, Then mid the flesh delights to rust in idle ease. But, very few there are, that thus much will admit: Nay, few or none there are that easily credit it; The most part, taking-part with common most conceit, Yet they haue heard of this, sustaine the tother straight: Not seeing, that themselues shun and refuse as ill, What vnto other men, for good they offer still. Not one of them vvill brooke his Son in sloath to lurke, But moues and stirrs him vp incessantly to vvork: Forbids him nothing more then sin-seed idleness: Nor any pleasure vaine permits him to possesse (For vvell he knowes, that vvay to vertue doth not lead, But thither-ward vvho vvalks a path of paine must tread): If he offend in ought, he chastens and reproues him, In so much sharper sort by how much more he loues-him. Thus handleth man the thing that most he holdeth deere, Yet thinks it strange himselfe should be so handled heere. May vve not rather think vve are belov'd of God, When as vve feele the stripes of his iust-gentle rod? And that, vvhom heer he lets liue as they list in pleasure, Are such as least he loues, and holds not as his treasure? For so, not of our slaues, but of our sonnes elect, By sharp-sweet chastisements the manners vve correct. In very deed God doth as doth a prudent Sire, Who little careth what may crosse his childes desire, But vvhat may most auaile vnto his betterment: So, knowing vvell that ease vvould make vs negligent, He exerciseth vs, he stirres vs vp, and presses: And, though vve murmur much, yet neuer-more he ceases, He chastens, he afflicts: and those vvhom most he striketh, Are those vvhom most he loues, and whom he chiefly liketh. No valiant men of vvarre vvill murmur or mislike, For being plaç't to proue the formost push of pike: Nay, rather would they there already front the foe, With losse of deerest blood, their dauntlesse harts to show. If an exploit approach, or Battel-day draw nie, If ambush must be laid, some Stratagem to trie; Or, must they meet the foe in eger skirmish fell, Or for the sleepy hoast all night keepe sentinell: From grudging at the paines, so far off are they all, That blest they count themselues; therefore their Generall Imployes them often-times, as most couragious; And, them approu'd, he plants in places dangerous: But, no man makes account of such as shun the charge, Whose paine is not so little as their shame is large. All of vs (in this world) resemble Souldiers right, From day-breake of our birth euen to our dying night: This life it is a warre, vvherein the valiantest, With hottest skirmishes are euer plied and prest: Whom our grand-Captaine most sets-by, he sets a-frunt The foreward, as most fit to beare the chiefest brunt. Cares, exiles, prisonments, diseases, dolours, losses, Maimes, tortures, torments, spoiles, contempt, dishonours, crosses, All these are hard exploits, and full of bickrings bold, Which he commits to those whom he doth deerest hold: But, leaueth those behinde for whom he careth little, To stretch themselues at ease amid their honours brittle, Their pomps, their dignities, their ioies, their gems, their treasures, Their dainties, their delights, their pastimes and their pleasures; Like coward Groomes that guard the baggage and the stuffe, While others meet the foe, and shew their valours proofe. But haue not these (say some) in these afflictions part? No; but of punishment, they often feele the smart: Afflicted those we count, whom chastnings tame, and turne; The other punished, that at correction spurne: The first (still full of hope) reape profit by their rods; The later (desperate) through spight wax worse by ods. Boy-stragglers of a Camp, so should be punisht then, Being naked forç't to fight with troupes of armed men, Who cannot reap nor reach the pleasure, nor the meed, Nor th'honour incident for doing such a deed: To such praise-winning place, braue Souldiers gladly run, Which as a dangerous place these faint-harts sadly shun. What Warriour in the world, that had not rather trie A million of extreames (yea rather euen to die) Then with disgracefull spot to staine his Honour bright In these corporeall Warres? Yet, in the ghostly fight (Of glory careless all) wee shun all labours pain, To purchase with reproche a rest-nestidly-vain. Vertue is not atchieu'd, by spending of the yeer In pleasures soft, sweet shades, down beds and dainty cheere: Continuall trauell 'tis that makes vs there arriue, And so by trauell too Vertue is kept aliue: For, soon all vertue vades without some exercise; But, being stird, the more her vigour multiplies. Besides, what man is he, that feels some member rotten, Whereof he feares to die, but causeth straight be gotten Some surgeon, that with sawe, with cauter, or with knife, May take that part away, to saue his threatned life: And suffers (though with smart) his very flesh and bones To be both sear'd, and saw'd, and cleane cut-off at once? But, to recure the soule (the soule with sin infected) All wholesome remedies are hated and reiected: With the Physician kind th'impatient Patient frets, Nor to come neere him once his helpfull hand he lets: We are halfe putrefied, through sinnes contagious spot, And without speedy help the rest must wholly rot: Cut-off th'infected part, then are we sound and free, Els all must perish needs, there is no remedie. Most happy they, from whom in this fraile life, the Lord (With smart of many paines) cuts-off the paines abhord Of th'euer-neuer death, wherein they lye and languish, That heere haue had their ease and neuer tasted anguish. But many, which as yet the aduerse part approoue, Conceiue (if not confesse) that it doth more behooue By faintless exercise faire Vertue to maintaine, Then ouer-whelm'd with Vice, at rest to rust in vaine. But yet th'extreamity of sufferings doth dismay-them, The force where-of they feare would easily ouer-lay them: They loue the exercise, the chastenings likewise like them, But yet they would haue God but seld and softly strike-them; Els are they prest to runne, to ruine, with the Diuels, They are so sore afeard of false supposed euils: Most wretched is the man that for the feare of nifles, All liuely-breathing hopes of happy goodnes stifles. Of nifles, Sir, say they? seeme all their bitter crosses, As nothing? nor their paines, nor lamentable losses, That daily they indure? were not the vvretches blest, If from their heauie load their shoulders vvere releast? Who is not happy (sure) in misery and woe, No doubt prosperity can neuer make him so: No more then he that's sick should find more ease vpon A glorious golden bed, then on a wooden one. Man harbours in himselfe the euill that afflicts-him, And his owne fault it is, if discontentment pricks-him: And all these outward ills are wrongfully accused, Which flesh and blood doth blame; for, being rightly vsed, They all turne to our good: but whoso takes offence Thereby, hath by and by his iust rough recompence: For neither in their power, nor in their proof the same Are euills in effect, but in conceit and name: Which when we lightly vvaigh, the least of vs surmounts them, Nor hurt they any one but him that ouer-counts them. Neither ought that (indeed) for euill to be rated, Which may by accident be vnto good translated: For ill is euer ill, and is contrary euer Directly vnto good, so that their natures neuer Can be constrain'd to brooke each other, neither yet Can th'one be euer turn'd to th'other opposite: But, plainely we perceiue, that there's no languor such, But long continuance and custome lighten much; Familiarizing so the Fit, that how-so fret it, Euen in the extremitie one may almost forget it. What better proofe of this then these poore Gally-slaues, Which, hauing been before such Rogues and idle Knaues, As shunning seruices to labour were so loth, That they would starue and die rather then leaue their sloth, But being vs'd a while to tug the painfull Oare, Labour that yerst they loath'd, they now desire the more: Or those that are assail'd with burning Feuer-fit, Euen then when least of all they dread or doubt of it: Who carefully complaine, and crie, and raue and rage, Frying in inward flames, the which they cannot swage; Yet, if it wax not worse, the daintiest body makes it In eight dayes as a vse, and as a trifle takes it: Or, those that haue somtimes the painfull rack indured, Who without charge of paine being a while inured, The paine that did constraine them to bewaile and weepe, Seemes them so easie then, they almost fall a-sleepe. All are not euills then, that are surnamed so, Sith euill neuer can his nature mingle, no, Nor turne it into good; whereas we plainely see On th'other side, that these are changed sodainly. And, vvere they ills (indeed) sith they so little last, Were 't not a very shame to be so much agast? But here again (say they) th'ones nature neuer taketh The others nature on, but still the stronger maketh His fellow giue him place, and only beareth sway Till that, return'd againe, driue it againe away. Nay, that can neuer be: for neuer perfect good Can by his contrarie be banisht (though withstood): For, good is euer good, and wheresoe'r it goe Euill doth euer striue, but with too strong a foe. There is no reason then, these, good, or ill to call, That alter in this sort, and neuer rest at all: Neither to blesse or blame them for the good or ill That euer in her selfe our soule concealeth still. For, if that from without, our bale, or else our blisse Arriued; euermore withall must follow this, That alwaies, vnto all, selfe ill, selfe paine, would bring: Selfe good, one selfe content: but tis a certaine thing, They are not taken for their quality and kind, But rather as th'effects of men are most inclin'd. One, losing but a crowne, hath lost his patience quight: Another, hauing lost fiue hundred in a night, Is neuer mov'd a iote, though (hauing lesse in store, Then th'other hath by ods) his losse might grieue him more. One, being banished, doth nothing but lament, Another (as at home) is there as well content. And, one in prison pent, is vtterly dismaide: Another, as at home, liues there as well appaid. Needs must we then confesse, that in our selues doth rest That which vnhappieth vs, and that which makes vs blest: In vs (indeed) the ill, which of our selues doth growe: And in vs too the good, which from God's grace doth flowe, To whom it pleaseth him: true good that none can owe-yet, Saue those on whom the Lord vouchsafeth to bestow-it: And that the bitter smart of all the paines that wring-vs, From nothing but our sinne, receiueth strength to sting-vs. Yea, surely in our selues abides our miserie: Our Grand-sire Adam left vs that for Legacie, When he enthrall'd himselfe vnto the Law of sin, Wherein his guilty heires their griefe-full birth begin. The Lord had giuen to him a Nature and a feature, Perfect (indeed) and blest aboue all other creature; And of this Earthly world had stablisht him as King, Subiecting to his rule the reanes of euery thing: His spirit within it selfe no selfe-debates did nurse, Hauing no knowledge yet of better nor of worse: His body ever blithe and healthfull felt no war Of those foure qualities that now doo euer iarre: Nor any poysony plant, nor any Serpent fell, Nor any noysom beast could hurt him any deale: He might, without the taste of bitter death, attaine Vnto the Hauen of Heauen, were all true Ioyes doo raigne. And, had he not misdone, he might haue well bequeath'd The same inheritance to all that euer breath'd: How happy had he been, if he had neuer eaten Th'vnlawfull fatall fruit that double Death did threaten? O that he neuer had preferd the Serpents flatter Before th'eternall Law of all the worlds Creator. You shall be (said the Fiend) like supreame Deities: This sweet fruits sugred iuice shall open both your eyes Which now your tyrant God (enuying all your blisse) Blindes with a filmy vaile of black Obscurities, Lest that you should become his equals in degree, Knowing both good and ill as well as euer he. Poor Eue beleeues him straight, and Man beleeues his wife, And biteth by and by the Apple asking-life: Whereof so soone as he had tasted, he begins (But all too-late alas) to see his cursed sinnes. His eyes (indeed) were ope, and then he had the skill To know the difference between the good and ill: Then did he knowe how good, good was when he had lost-it, And euill too he knew (but ah too deerely cost-it) Leauing himselfe (besides the sorrow of his losse) Nothing but sad despaire of succour in his crosse. He found himself falne down from blisse-full state of peace Into a ciuill warre where discords neuer cease: His soule reuolting, soon became his bitter foe. But (as it oft befalls that worst doo strongest growe) She is not eas'd at all by th'inly striuing iarres, Which doo annoy her more then th'irefull open warres. Wrath, hatred, enuy, feare, sorrow, despaire, and such; And passions opposite to these, afflict as much, Distracting to and fro the Princesse of his life, In restless mutinies, and neuer ceasing strife. Then th'humor-brethren all, hot, cold, and wet, and dry, Falne out among themselues, augment his misery. So that (by their debate) within his flesh there seeded A haruest of such weeds as neuer can be weeded. All creatures that before (as Subiects) did attend-him, Now, 'among themselues conspire by all meanes to offend-him: In briefe, Immortall borne, now mortall he became, And bound his soule to bide Hells euer-burning flame, Leauing his wofull heires (euen from their births beginning) Heires of his heauy paine, as of his hainous sinning. So that, in him, the Lord condemned all mankind, To beare the punishment to his foule sinne assign'd: And none had euer scap't, had not the God of grace (Desiring more to saue, then to subuert his race) Redeem'd vs by the death of his deer onely Son, And chosen vs in him before the World begun: Forgiuing vs the fault, and with the fault the fine; All saue this temporall death, of Adams sin the signe. Now in the horror of those ease-lesse, end-lesse paines, It may be rightly said that euill euer raignes: That's euill's very selfe; and not this seeming-woe, Wherof the wanton world complaineth daily so. Liv'd we ten thousand yeers continually tormented In all fell tortures strange that euer were inuented, What's that compar'd to time that neuer shall expire, Amid th'infernall flames, whose least-afflicting fire Exceedeth all the paines, all mortall hearts can thinke? Sure, all that we endure, till Lethe drops we drinke, Is all but ease to that: or if it be a paine, Tis in respect of that a very trifle vaine. But, were't a great deale worse, why should we euill name That which we rather finde a medicine for the same? Health, wealth, security, honour and ease doo make vs Forget our God, and God for that doth soone forsake vs; Whereas afflictions are ready meanes to mooue vs, To seeke our health in him that doth so deerely loue-vs. 'Tis true indeed: (say some) that benefit they bring-vs, But yet the smart thereof doth so extreamly wrings-vs, That th'euill which they feele that doo indure the same, Makes them esteeme it iust to giue it that for name. Mans nature, certainly (it cannot be denied) Is thrall to many throes, while here on earth we bide In body and in soule: the troubled soule sustaines A thousand passions strong, the body thousand paines: And that's the vvretched State, the vvhich yer-while I saide, Was iustly due to vs, vvhen Adam disobay'd. But, he that's once new-borne in Iesus Christ by faith, Who his assured hope in God sole settled hath, Who doth beleeue that God giues essence vnto all; And all sustaineth still: that nothing doth befall But by his sacred will, and that no strength that striueth To stop his iust decrees, can stand, or euer thriueth; Not onely doth accept all paines with patience, The which he takes for due vnto his deepe offence: Nor onely is content (if such be Gods good pleasure) To feele a thousand-fold a much more ample measure, But euen delights therein; and void of any feare, Expects th'extremitie of all assaults to beare: Whether almighty God abate their woonted vigor, Or (that his may not feele their crosses cruell rigor) Doo wholly arme them with new forces for the nonce, To beare the bitter brunt: or whether both at once. And, to approoue this true; how many dayly drink Of torments bitter Cup, that neuer seeme to shrink? Alas what sharper smart? what more afflicting paines? What worser griefe then that, which ceas-lesly sustaines? He that by some mischance, or els by martiall thunder, Vnhappily hath had some maine bone broke in sunder? What torment feeleth not the sore-sicke deepe-diseased? One while with cruell fit of burning Feuer seised: Another while assail'd with Colick and with Stone, Or with the cure-lesse Gout, whose rigour yeelds to none? Or thousand other griefes, whose bitter vexing strife Disturbes continually the quiet of our life? Yet notwithstanding this, in all this painfull anguish, (Though the most parte repine, and plain, and mourn, and languish Murmuring against the Lord, with malcontented voice) Some praise his clemencie, and in his rods reioyce. How many such (deere Saints) haue fell tormenters seene To die betweene their hands, through moody tyrants teen, So little daunted at their martyrdome and slaughter, That in th'extremity they haue expressed laughter? How many at the stake, nay, in the very flame, Haue sung, with cheerfull voice, th'Almightie's prais-full name? Yet were they all compact of artirs and of veines, Of sinewes, bones, and flesh: and sensible of paines (By nature at the least) as much as any other, For being issued all from one selfe earthly mother. What makes them then to find such extream smart so sweet? What makes them patiently those deadly pangs to meet? No doubt it is the Lord, who first of nothing made-vs, Who with his liberall hand of goodnes still doth lade-vs, Some more and other lesse: and neuer ceaseth space From making vs to feele the fauours of his grace. Accurst are they (indeed) whom he doth all abandon To doo their Lust for Law, and runne their life at randon: Accurst who neuer taste the sharp-sweet hand of God: Accurst (ah, most accurst) who neuer feele his rod. Such men (by nature born the bond-slaues vnto sinne) Through self-corruption, end worse then they did beginne: For, how they longer liue, the more by their amisse, They draw them neerer Hell, and farther-off from blisse. Such men within themselues their euils spring containe: There is no outward thing (as falsly they complaine) Cause of their cureless ill: for good is euery thing, And good can (of it selfe) to no-man euill bring. Now, if they could aright these earthly pleasures prize According to their worth, they would not in such wise, For lack, or losse of these (so vaine and transitorie) Lament so bitterly, nor be so sadly-sorrie. But ouer-louing still these outward things vnstable, To rest in true content an houre they are not able, No, not a moments time, their feare doth so assaile-them: And, if their feare fall true, that their good-fortune faile-them, Then swell their sullen hearts with sorrow till they burst, And then (poor desperate soules) they deem themselues accurst; And so (indeed) they are: but yet they erre in this, In blaming other things, for their owne selfe-amisse; Other indifferent things, that neither make, nor marre, But to the good, be good; to th'euill, euill are. Is't not great foolishnes, for any to complaine That somthing is not don, which doth him nought constraine? Sith, if he vse the same, soule-health it hurteth not: Or, if he doo not vse't, it helpeth not a iot. But needs must we complain (say some) for we haue cause: Then at your perill be 't; for, that which chiefly drawes You thereto, 'tis in trueth your brutenesse in mis-deeming Things euill, that are good (for sense-contrary seeming): And, while that in the darke of this foule errors mist, Your drowsie spirits doo droope, alas what maruell is 't If euill follow you, and if (iniurious) still To others you impute your selfe-ingendred ill? Happy are they to whom the Lord vouchsafeth sight To see the louely beames and life-infusing Light Of his sweet sacred Truth; whereby we may perceiue And iudge a-rightly, what to loue, and what to leaue. Such men within their soules, their goods haue wholly plac't; Such goods, as neuer fire can either burne or waste: Nor any theefe can steale, nor Pirat make his preie, Nor vsurie consume, nor Tyrant take away; Nor times all-gnawing tooth can fret away nor finish, Nor any accident of sad mischance diminish. For it is built on God, a Rock that euer standes: Not on the vanities of these inconstant sands, Which are more mutable then winde, and more vnstable, And day by day doo make so many miserable. O, to what sweet content, to what high ioyes aspires He, that in God alone can limit his desires! He that in him alone his hopes can wholly rest, He that for onely end, waites for the wages blest, Wherewith he promiseth for euer (sans respect Of their selfe-meriting) to guerdon his Elect? What is it can bereaue the wealth of such a man? What is it that disturbe his perfect pleasures can? What is it can supplant his honours and degrees? Sith all his treasures, his delights, his dignities Are all laid vp in Heauen, where it were all in vaine For all the sonnes of earth to warre with might and maine. No doubt (will some man say) each Christian doth aspire (After their bodies death) to those deer treasures higher, That are reserv'd in Heauen, whereof the sweet possession Feares not the violence of all the worlds oppression: But, while that here below this fraile flesh-burden ties-him, But the bare hope he hath: which how can it suffise-him Against the sharp assaults of passions infinite, Whose glad-sad crosse conflicts afflict him day and night? Needs must I graunt (indeed) that the same perfit ioy We cannot perfitly vpon this earth enioy: But, that that hope alone doth not sufficiently Blesse his life where it liues (for my part) I denie. Some doe not feare (we see) to spend their stock and store, To vndertake the taske of many trauailes sore, To hazard limmes, and liues, in seruice of some Lord; Depending oft vpon his foole-fat-feeding word; Or waiting els (perhaps) without all other hold, Vntill it please himselfe his franknes to vnfold; Not reaking all their paine, they are so inly pleas'd With hoped benefit, whereof they are not seaz'd? And, shall th' assured hope of euer-blisses then, For which we haue the word, not of vaine mortall men, That teach their tongues to lie; but of the highest God, The God of truth, Truth's selfe, where truth hath still aboade: Shall that (I say) not serue to settle our faint hearts, Against (I will not say) like dangers and like smarts: But 'gainst these petty griefes, that now and then do pain-vs, No more like those then heauen neer earth that doth sustain-vs? Ah, shall we then despise all trouble and vexation, Supported by a prop of doubtfull expectation? And, while for earthly things we can indure all this, Shall we not do asmuch for an immortall blisse? Indeed not of our selues: for, selfly nought we can; But God (when pleaseth him) doth giue this strength to man, Whereby he standeth stout; euen like a mighty rocke Amid the mounting waues, when Eöle doth vnlocke Sterne Austers stormie gate, making the waters wrastle And rush with wrathfull rage against the sturdie castle, While it (for all the force of their fell furie showne) Is not so much as moou'd, and much lesse ouerthrowne. So fareth such a man: for, if from high degree, He sodainly do slide to liue contemnedly With the vile vulgar sort; That cannot make him wauer: For, well he is assur'd, that God's high holy favour Depends not on the pomp, nor vaine-proud state and port, That for the grace of Kings adornes the courtly sort. If he be kept in bands, thral to the tyrannies And extreame-cruell lawes of rutheless enimies, Both voyde of helpe and hope, and of all likelihood Of being euer freed from their hands thirsting-blood; In spight of them, he knowes that one day he shall die, And then he shall inioy an endless Libertie. If he be forc't to fly from his deere country-clime, In exile to expire the remnant of his time, He doth suppose the World to be a Country common, From whence, a tyrants wrath (till death) can banish no man. If that he must forsake his Parents and his Kin, And those whose amitie he most delighteth in; He knowes that where he findes a man he findes a Kins-man: For all mankind is come from one selfe Father (sinnes-man) If (being spoil'd of wealth, &amp; wanton-pampering plentie) He find vpon his boord two dishes scant of twentie, And to his back one coate to keepe the cold away, Where as he had before, a new for euery day; He learneth of Saint Paul, who bids vs be content With food and furniture to this life competent: Sith nothing (as faith Iob) into this world we brought, Nor with vs when we die can we hence carry ought. If he be passing poore, and in exceeding lack Of euery needfull thing for belly and for back, He learneth of the Sonne, that God the Father heedeth To giue to euery one (in time) the thing he needeth: And that the Fowles of Heauen, and Cattel small and great, Doo neither sowe nor reape, yet find they vvhat to eate: Yea, that the Lillies faire, which growe among the grasse, Doo neither spin nor worke, and yet their garments passe (For colour and for cost, for Art and ornament) The glorious Salomon's rich robes of Parlament. If so that he be sicke, or wounded in the arme, In body, back, or brest, or such like kind of harme: If in extremitie of angry paine and anguish, Enfeebled still by fits, he bed-rid lye and languish If all the miseries that euer martyr'd man, At once on euery side afflict him all they can: The more that he endures, the more his comforts growe, Sith so his wrechednes he sooner comes to knowe; That from worlds vanities he may himselfe aduance, Which hold all those from heauen, that still delight that dance: He feares not those at all that with their vtmost might, Hauing the body slaine, can do no farther spight: But onely him that with ten thousand deaths can kill The soule and body both for euer if he will: He knowes it is their lot that seek to please their God, To be afflicted still with persecutions rod: So that, what-euer crosse, how-euer sharpe assaile-him, His constant harts-content and comfort cannot faile-him. But, he must die (say you). Alas, can that dismay? Where is the labourer that (hauing wrought all day Amid the burning heat, with wearinesse opprest) Complaines that night is come when he shall goe to rest? The Marchant that returnes from some far forraine Lands, Escaping dreadfull rocks, and dangerous shelfs and sands, When as he sees his ship her home-hauen enter safe, Will he repine at God, and (as offended) chafe For being brought too soon home to his natiue soil, Free from all perils sad that threaten Saylours spoile? He knowes, from thousand deaths that this one death doth lose him, That in heauens euer-ioyes, he euer may repose-him: That he must bring his Bark into this Creeke, before In th'euerlasting Land he can set foot a-shoare: That he can neuer come to incorruption, Vnles that first his flesh doo feele corruption: So that, all rapt with ioy, hauing his help so readie, This ship-wrack he escapes, as on a rock most steddie. But, more (perhaps) then death the kind of death dismaieth, Which serues him for a bridge that him to heauen conuaieth. Whether he end his dayes by naturall disease: Or in a boysterous storme do perish on the Seas: Or by the bloody hands of armed foes be slaine: Or by mischance a stone fall downe, and dash his braine: Or by the murdering ball of new-found earthly thunder, By day or els by night his bones be pasht a-sunder: Or burned at a stake, or bitterly tormented By cruell slaughter-men, in tortures new-inuented; Alas, alas! for that, much-lesse then least he careth: For, as a man falne down into a Pit, he fareth; Who, if he may be drawne vp from the noysom place, Where Adders, Toades, and Snakes craule ouer feet &amp; face, Respects not, whether that ye vse a silken scaine, Hemp-rope, or chaine of gold, so he get vp againe: Euen so, so he may come to his desired blisse, The maner and the meanes to him indifferent is: As for the differing paine (if any him do torture) If it be violent, he knowes it is the shorter: But, be it n'er so long, long sure it cannot last To vs, whose Post-like life is all so quickly past. Now, such a man, in whom such firme contents do hyue, Who can denie to be the happiest man aliue? And who so impudent, that dareth now professe That this worlds fained sweet (whose vnfain'd bitternesse Brings, to this very life, full many torments fell, And after dingeth downe to th'endless paine of Hell) Should be preferr'd before these seeming-sowrs, that make vs Taste many true-sweet sweets yer this dead life forsake vs, And after, lift vs vp to that same blessed ioy, That euermore shall last exempt from all annoy. So few there will be found (as I suppose) so deeming, As many which (more fear'd with these ills falsly-seeming, Than inly falne-in-loue with heauen-ioyes excellence) Approouing this estate, fly't as the pestilence. And yet, in this estate is found felicity (As far foorth as it may, amid the vanity Of this frail fading world where each thing hourly changes): For, neuer from it selfe true happinesse estranges: It neuer dooth decay, it neuer doth decrease: In spight of angry Warre it euer liues in peace: Maugre poore want, it hath ten thousand kinds of wealth: Amid infirmities it hath continuall health: Inuiron'd round with woe, it doth reioyce and sing: Depriv'd of dignities, it's greater then a King, It sits secure and safe, free from hart-pining feares: For, euer with it selfe it all deere treasures beares; Not needing any aide of men-of-armes to watch them, Nor fearing fraud, nor force of any foe to catch-them. Whereas, we dayly see so many men, whose mind To transitorie trash of worldly-wealth inclinde, In their abundance beg, and in their plentie poore (For who hath had so much, that hath not wished more?) No treasures can suffice the gulf of their desire; Yea, make them Emperours, yet will they more aspire: Peace cannot pacifie the fell rebellious broyle That in their troubled soule doth euer burne and boyle. For euery short content of any false delight, A thousand bitter throes torment them day and night. All their estate doth stand abroad in hands of strangers: Therfore, the more their wealth, the more their daily dangers, The more their miseries, because the more they need Much strength and many men vnto their hoords to heed; Dreading (with cause) lest craft or cruelty, or either Bereaue them of their blisse, and treasure both together. Needs must we then confesse, that in aduersitie Ther is more happiness then in prosperity; Sith that the minde of man so soone it selfe betrayes Vnto the guilefull snares that worldly pleasure layes, Which make vs at the last head-long to Hell to runne: All which, aduersitie doth make vs safely shunne. But, here it may be askt, if pleasure, state, and store (Plunging vs in the Pit of vices more and more) Be subiect so to make vs more and more accurst, Must we esteeme that griefe (which sense esteemeth worst) More fit to better vs, and bring vs vnto blisse, Then those whose smarting sting is not so strong as this? Sure, sith that in our selues our cause originall Of blisse and bale we hide, it matters not at all: For, still the faithfull man one and the same remains, Whether the griefe be great or little he sustains; Sith how so e'r it be, he takes occasion thence, To seek in God alone, his comfort and defence. But for because our soule (the while she doth consort With this grosse fleshly lump) cannot, but in som sort Suffer as sensible, yea, oftentimes so far, That her best functions all, lesse apt and able are, Than els at other times; I doo suppose the proof Of one, then other ill, auailes more in behoof. That this is so, we see, a sick-man oft to finde Such ioyfull quietnes, and comfort in his minde, That he esteems himselfe the best content-aliue: But yet the sharpe disease (which doth his health depriue) With-holdeth in som sort his senses and his wit, That freely other-where he cannot vse them fit. And so it fares with him, that (through-resolued well) Endures the cruell strains of any torture fell. Now, for the banisht man, the changing of his dwelling Neuer disturbes his ioy. And he whose wealth excelling Turns in a trice to want by whatsoeuer chaunce, His courage neuer shrinkes, nor yet his countenance. So that in their content, all foure are all a-like, A-like reioycing all in their afflictions eek: A-like contemning all worlds pompous vanities: But, the two last haue odds in their extremities; In that, without impeach, they may apply their minde To many goodly things, wherein great ioy they finde (I mean when each distresse offends a man alone, Not when he is assail'd at once of euery one.) Yet, perill's quickly past, danger endureth not, Exile so easie growes that it is soon forgot, The greatest losse that is we minde not many houres: For, thousand accidents distract this soule of ours, Which cannot in such sort the senses still restrain, But that they will goe feed on many obiects vain; Whereby at vn-awares she oftentimes, surpris'd, Is ouer-reacht by those, whose rigour she despis'd: And so, the pleasant taste she doth vntimely misse, Wherewith affliction sweet doth season heer her blisse. So that, som other state (wherein our soule, lesse fed With sundry obiects vain, shall be more setteled) May rightly be preferd to these which make her stay, And stumble often-times, vnto her owne decay. And therefore, I maintaine Close Prison to be best Of all afflictions that may a man molest; Considering, all defects to other crosses common, In this are seldom found, and almost, felt of no man. For Prison is a place where God sequesters men, Farre from the vile prospect of vanities terrene, To make them thence withdrawe their harts, and to confesse That in his grace alone consists their happiness. It is a learned School, where God himself reads cleerly True wisedoms perfect rules, to those he loueth deerly. There, th'vnderstanding (free, amid the many chains, That binde the body fast) findes out a thousand means To learne another day to be more apt and able (According to our place) for vses seruiceable, To profit publike-weal: for euermore we ought (In seeking self-gain) see that common good be sought. Knowledge is onely learn'd by long exercitation: For which, what fitter mean then such a sequestration, Where each man, vndisturb'd, through diligence may growe, According to the gifts that gratious Heav'ns bestowe: One, in ability to rule a lawfull State, The vertuous to aduance, and vicious to abate: Another, from the Tombe to fetch Antiquity, Another to discern the Truth from Sophistry: Another (by the feats of elder men at Armes) To frame wise Stratagems for wofull wars alarmes: For, Souldiers oftentimes may more experience get By reading, then they can where Camp and Camp is met. And (briefly to conclude) som, grauely to aduise, Som, bold to execute, as each mans calling lies: But most of all, to search within the sacred Writ, The secret mysteries to mans saluation fit. A world of vanities (that doo distract vs heer, During our Libertie) in Durance, com not neer: The wall that lets our leggs from walking out of door, Bounding vs round about within a narrow floor, Doth gard vs from the gall which Sathan (spring of spight) Mingles among the sweets of this vain worlds delight. If he be happier man that liueth free from foes, Then he whom angry troops of enemies inclose: Much more the Prisoner then of his high blisse may boast, For being so farre off from such a hugie hoast Of hatefull foes so fierce in malice and in might, Himself so faint and weake, and so vnfit to fight. For he, and we (God wot) in steed of standing to-it (How-euer in a vein, we vaunt that we will do-it) When 't commeth to the brunt we cannot brook the field, But either flie like hares, or els like cowards yeeld. The sundry obiects fond, which make vs soon forget Each other chastisment, in this doo neuer let. For turn we where we list, and look which way we wil, At all times to our sight one thing is offred still: Whether on pauement, roof, or wall, we cast our eye, Alwaies of our estate an Image we descry: And so it also fares with our newes-greedy ear, One very sound resounds about vs euery where: Where-euer harken we, we hear of nought but foes, Our keepers commonly are not too-kind, God knowes: By the least noyse that is, continually they tell In what estate we stand, and in what house we dwell. So that incessantly our harts are lift on high, Som-times to prayse the Lord for his benignity, Who doth not punish vs after our foule offense, Though by a thousand sinnes we daily him incense: Som-times to magnifie his admirable might, Which hath our feeble harts with such great force bedight, That we, in stead of grief, or grudging at the pains Of sharpest chastisements, whereof the world complains, Leauing this loathed Earth, doo mount the highest place, Where (through true faith) we taste his honey-sweeter grace: Som-times to giue him thanks for all the wealth exceeding, Which from his liberall hand we haue to help our needing: And to be short, sans cease to meditate on all The countless benefits that from his goodnes fall, Not suffering any houre to pass away for nought Without exalting him, in deed, or word, or thought. Yet, doth the world esteem this, a most hard estate, And him that feels the same, it counts vnfortunate: But I would gladly see som other state, wherein (With such commodity) so much content is seen; Wherein lesse hinderance, and lesse incomberance lies, To make men misse the path vnto perfections prise. Sure sir (will som man say) you set a good face on-it: One might at length conuert, commenting so vpon-it, The cruell'st Prison-house into a Mansion fair, Where 't were not hard to liue content, and void of care. You take your Prisoner for a practiue man of Art: But such as those (God knowes) you finde the fewest part, You fain him to be friend to solitude and quiet: But the most part are prone to reuell and to riot. One must be free from noyse that means to study well: Whereof, who can be sure in such a servile Hell? Besides, he must haue Books, and Paper, Pen, and Inke, All which in Prisoners hands are seldom left I think; So that you do not fain your gail so good and gainfull, As to finde out the same is difficult and painfull. I answere in a word (if any so shall wrangle: I doo not bound all blisse within so straight an angle: I say great happiness and hart-reviuing ioy Followes th'afflicted sort in euery sharp annoy: But that there is no crosse that doth so much auail, To make vs fit to help our neighbour, as the gail, Wherein the God of grace at his good pleasure giues Means to effect the same, vnto the least that liues. But be it so, in bands, that nothing learne we can, 'Tis to be learn'd inough to be an honest man: And this is th'only School, wherin th'Arch-master teacheth, Himself, by secret means, rules that the rudest reacheth. Th'aduice of such a one more profit doth impart, Then of the wicked sort with all their curious Art. Concerning solitude, although that commonly Our nature be inclin'd vnto the contrary; There the assistant grace of God we chiefly finde, Who changing of our place doth also change our minde. For being free from noyse, and for obtaining tools To helpe our knowledge with, as in all other Schools; God euer cares for those that feare his name for loue: And, if that any such, such inconvenience proue, If any money need, or els (through ample distance) Be destitute of friends, he gets them (for assistance) The fauour of their foes, whose harts he handles so (How euer they intend his childrens ouerthrowe) That his, of what they need haue euermore inough, According as he knowes to be to their behoof. Now say, that we consent (say som) that this is true: But what if somwhat worse then all this worst ensue? What, if he be inforc't his Countrey to forsake? What, if continuall fits his sickly body shake? What, if he lose at once his wealth and reputation, Repleat on euery side with euery sharp vexation? Can he still keep his ioy, and can he still retain Such means to profit still, for all his grief and pain? Concerning his content, it's alwayes all a-like, Whether that euery grief particularly strike; Or, whether all at once he feel their vtmost anger: And if he be surpris'd with so extream a languor That (as I said before) the spirit it inforce (Through suffering of the smart that doth afflict the corps) To leaue his Offices, so that he cannot write, Nor reade, nor meditate, nor study, nor indight; It is so quickly past, that in comparison, Regarding so great good, 'tis not to think vpon. For, by a mighty griefe our life is quickly ended; Or els, by remedy it selfe is soon amended; And, if it be but mean, then is it born the better, And so vnto the soule it is not any letter. Besides, we must conceiue, our spirit (as opprest With fainting weariness) somtimes desireth rest To gather strength again, during which needfull pawse We are not to be blam'd, sith need the fame doth cause: So, that the time that's lost while such sharp pangs do pain, May be suppos'd a time of taking breath again. In prison (to conclude) a man at once may trie All manner of extreams of earthly misery: In which respect (perhaps) the worse som deem of it, Being (as 't were) the Butt that all men striue to hit; But, I esteem the same the perfecter for that: For, if one crosse alone can make vs eleuate Our groueling earth-desires from cogitations base, To haue recourse to God, and to implore his grace, Seeking in him alone our perfect ioy and blisse; Much more shall many griefs at once, accomplish this. For many can doo more then one (without respect): And still, the greater cause the greater the effect. Indeed (say other-som) these reasons haue som reason: But, then whence comes it, that so many men in Prison (With hundred thousand pains, pincht and oppressed sore) In steed of bettering there, wax worser then before: In steed of sweet content, doo still complain and crie; In steed of learning more, lose former industry? Though (in apparance great) your sayings seem but iust, Yet plain experience (sure) we think is best to trust. That hidden vertue rare, that so great good atchiues, Lies in the Prisoners hart, not in his heauy Gyues; The good growe better there, the bad become the wurse: For by their sinne they turn Gods blessing into curse. And that's the cause the most are mal-content and sad: Sith euermore the good are fewer then the bad. But, wherefore doth not God to all vouchsafe his grace? Proud earth-worms, pawse we there: let's feare before his face, Admiring humbly all his holy Iudgements high, Exceeding all too far our weak capacitie. The Potters vessell vile, doth vs our lesson showe, Which argues not with him why he hath made it so: Much less may we contend, but rather rest content With that which God hath giuen. He is omnipotent, All gracious, and all good, most iust, and perfit wise. On som, he poures a Sea of his benignities, On som a shallow Brook, on other som a Flood: Giuing to som, a small; to som, a greater good: As from eternity hath pleas'd th'eternall Spirit To looue men more or lesse, without respect of merit. For my part, should I liue ten Nestors yeers to passe, Had I a hundred tongues more smooth then Tully's was, Had I a voice of steel, and had I brazen sides, And learning more then all the Heliconian guides; Yet were I all too-weake to tell the many graces, That in ten thousand sorts, and in ten thousand places, Ten hundred thousand times he hath vouchsafed me (Not for my merits sake, but for his mercy free): But yet, 'mong all the goods that of his liberall bounty I haue receiu'd so oft, none to compare account-I With this Close prisonment, wherein he doth with-drawe-me Far from the wanton world, and to himself doth draw-me. I posted or apace to ruin and perdition, When by this sharp-sweet Pil, my cunning kinde Physition Did purge (maugre my will) the poysony humor fell Wherewith my sin-sick hart alreadie gan to swell. I lookt for nothing lesse then for these miseries, And paines that I haue prov'd: the worlds vain vanities Had so seduç't my soule with baits of sugred bane, That it was death to me, from pleasure to be tane: But (crossing my request) God (for my profit) gaue Me quite the contrary to that which I did craue. So that, my body barring from a freedom small, He set my soule at large, which vnto sinne was thrall: Wounding with musket-shot my feeble arme, he cur'd The festring sores of sinne, the which my soule endur'd: Tripping me from the top of som meane dignity, Which drew me vp to climbe the Mount of vanity, He rais'd me from the depth of vices darksom Cell, The which incessantly did ding me down to Hell: Easing me (to conclude) of all the grief and care, Wherewith these false delights for euer sauced are, He made me finde and feel (amid my most annoyes) A thousand true contents, a thousand perfect ioyes. But som (perhaps) amaz'd, will muse what kinde of pleasure Here I can take, and how I passe my time and leasure: For in foul idleness to spend so large a time, It cannot be denied to be a grieuous crime. First in the morning, when the spirit is fresh and fit, I suck the honey sweet from foorth the sacred Writ, Wherein (by faith) we taste that true celestiall bread, Whence our immortall soules are euer onely fed: Then search I out the sawes of other sage Diuines (The best here to be had) among whose humane lines, Supported by the grace of Gods especiall power, I leaue the thorn behinde, and pluck the healthsom flower. Somtimes, I doo admire, in books of Heathen men, Graue-sayings sauouring more a sacred Christian pen, Than many of our age, whose bold vnlearned pride Thinking to honour God, hath err'd on euery side: Sometimes when I obserue in euery ancient storie, Such vertues presidents, trim paterns of true glory, I wofully bewaile our wretched wicked dayes, Where vertue is despis'd, and vice hath all the praise. Oft I lament to see so many noble Wits (Neglecting Gods high praise, that best their learning fits) To sing of nought but lies, and loues, and wanton Theames, False sooth-sin flatteries, and idle Fairy dreames. Then, turning towards those, that fill'd with holier flame, For onely obiect chuse th'Eternalls sacred Name; These chiefly I admire, whose honourable brows Disdain the fained crown of fading Laurel boughs: Then full-gorg'd with the Sweets of such a dainty feast (Prickt forward with desire to imitate the best) Oft-times I exercise this Art-less Muse of mine To sing in holy Verse som argument divine. One while to praise my God for all received good: Another while to beg, that in his dear Sons blood My black sins hee will wash, and that hee will not waigh At his high Iustice beam, how I have gon astray. Somtimes, these wretched Times to pity and deplore, Wherein the wicked ones doo flourish more and more. Somtimes, to wail the State of sad distressed Sion Imploring to her aid the Tribe of Iudah's Lion. If any other Theam at any time I take, Yet never doth my Verse the settled bounds forsake That Verity prescribes, nor now no more disguise The vgly face of sin with mask of painted lies. And though that (heertofore) I also in my time Have writ Loues vanities in loose and wanton rime: 'T was as a whetstone that, whereon I whet my stile, Yer it were ably-apt ought graver to compile: Yet I repent thereof: for, wee must never tend To bring by evill means a good intent to end. When as my weary spirits som relaxation ask, To recreate the same, I take som other task: One while vpon the Lute, my nimble ioints I plie, Then on the Virginalls: to whose sweet harmonie Marrying my simple voice, in solemne Tunes I sing Some Psalme or holy Song, vnto the heauenly King. So that, the idlest houre of all the time that flies So fast is neuer free from some good exercise: Wherein I ioy as much, as euer I haue done In the most choise delights found vnderneath the Sun. But, you can neuer walke, nor goe to take the aire, Nor once looke out of doore, be weather ne'r so faire; But there in solitude you leade your life alone, Bard from the fellowship of (almost) euery one: Which doubtless (at the last) must grieue you needs I thinke. A man that neuer thirsts hath neuer need of drinke: So, though I be bereft these other things you speake-of, I misse nor minde them not as things I neuer reake-of. For, I haue school'd my heart since my captiuitie, To wish for nothing els, but what is granted me: And, what is granted me, contents me passing well. In each condition doth some contentment dwell. But men of differing states haue difference in delights, What pleaseth common eyes that irketh Princes sights, What rashlings do delight, that sober men despise, What fooles take pleasure in, doth but offend the wise, What prosperous people loath, afflicted folke will loue, And what the free abhorr, that prisoners will approue: But all haue equally indifferent power to make Them equally content, that can them rightly take: For, whoso presently himselfe can rightly beare, Hath neither passed ill, nor future ill, to feare: Th'one, which is now no more, ought now no more affray-vs. Th'other which is not yet, as little can dismay-vs. For, what no essence hath, that also hath no might: And that which hath no power, can do a man no spight: Besides, sith this our life is but a pilgrimage Through which we dayly passe to th'heauenly heritage; Although it seeme to thee that these my bands do let-me, Yet haste I to the goale the which my God hath set me, As fast as thou that runst thy selfe so out of breath In poasting night and day, by dales and hills and heath. If thou haue open fields, and I be prisoner; T'importeth me no more, then to the mariner Whether he go to sea shipt in some spacious arke, Or els (at lesser scope) aboord som lesser barke. Nay, heere the least is best; sith this vast Ocean wide, Whereon we daily saile, a thousand rocks doth hide, Gainst which the greater ships are cast-away full oft; While small boats (for the most) float ouer, safe, aloft. Then may I well conclude with reason and assurance, That there's no better state then to be kept in durance. A sweeter kind of life I neuer prou'd then there: Nor was I euer toucht with lesser griefe and care. If that I care at all, it is for others cause, And for the miseries this times corruption draws: But, being well assur'd that nothing heere betideth Against Gods ordinance and will that all things guideth: And knowing him to be good, iust, and most of might, I gladly yeeld my selfe to th'order he hath pight. For he it is, that now makes me accept so well And like of this estate which others hate as hell: He 'tis, that heretofore vouchsaf't me like relief, When as I was opprest with a more grieuous griefe: He 'tis from whom I hope in time to-come no lesse, Although a hundred fold were doubled my distresse. Yea, he it is that makes me profit euery day; And also so content in this estate to stay, That of my liberty I am not now so faine To think by liberty a happier life to gaine: For, I were wll content no more from hence to go, If I might profit most my friends and countrie so. Now here I humbly pray (expecting such an end) The Lord still towards me his fauour to extend; And that he will vouchsafe still to allot like grace, To all that for like cause are handled in like case. FINIS. OF THE VVORKE, AVTHOR, AND TRANSLATER. Lo heer, a Monvment admir'd of all That weigh the compass, weight, and height of It; O'r-topping Enuie's clowds, and ever shall, Sith built by deepest Art, and highest Wit. The Base that beares it, is the Word that stands True Grovnd of highest glorie, Truth, and grace: The Bvilding rear'd by two rare Heads and Hands Divinely holp) to glorifie that Base. Heer French and English, ioyne in friendly fight (On even Ground) to prove their vtmost powr; Who shew such equall Skill, and equall Might, That hard it is to say who's Conquerour. But, English bound to foot it like the French, And offer nought, but what shall like her foe, It is as glorious seld to take a Wrench, As being free, to give an Overthrowe. If French to English were so strictly bound, It would but passing lamely strive with it; And soon be forc't to lose both grace and ground, Although they straue with equall Skill and Wit. Besides, all Prose is easier to translate Then Verse; and easier lowe, then lofty Lines: Then, these Lines, reaching to the top of State, Are hard'st of all; yet none of all declines. O fair Translation then, with smoothed face, Go forth t'allure Times Turns, to turne Thee o're: So shall they in thy folds vnfold thy grace; And grace thee with Fames glorie more and more. If Ouid, Metam. He, that churn'd the cream of Poetry, To honied Butter, that the Muses feeds, Divined truely, it should never die; Then, what shall This, that far the same exceeds? He labour'd Lines, which though they doe endure All turns of Time, yet was their Stuf prophane: But, these are drawne of Stvf more heauenly-pure, That most shall shine; when those are in the wane. He, though his Braines (profanely) were divine, And glorious Monuments of Art compos'd, Was yet exil'd for many a looser Line, That made them wantons, chastly else dispos'd: But, Thou (cleer Bartas, his dear Sylvester, Whose Lines do lead to Vertves onely gain, And with sweet Poesies strew'st the way to Her) How should the World remunerate thy paine? And, If from Hearts Aboundance Tongues do speak; And what we most affect, we most do minde: It argues, thou this Argument didst seek; Sith, in thy Soule before, thou didst it finde. So, Bartas was but Mid-wife to thy Muse, With greater ease to vtter her Conceits; For whose dear birth, thou didst all ease refuse, Worlds-weal, and (being a Marchant) thy Receits. This pain so pleas'd thy labouring Thoughts, that thou Forsook'st the Sea, and took'st thee to the Soile; Where (from thy royall Trade) thou fell'st to Plow Arts furrows with thy Pen, that yeeld but toyl. This stole thee from thy selfe, thy selfe to finde In sacred Raptures on the Muses Hill: And, went'st out of thy Bodie with thy Minde, More freely so, to vse thy Wit and Will. And (O!) how hapless had we Brittans been (Sith heer is stor'd such sweet Soule-rauishments) Hadst thou not made them to vs clearly seen: Who give thee for it praising-Discontents. If so great Art and Grace finde nought but Fame Of famous Men for grace; the Press shall be Prest but for Vices Service (Sourse of Shame). So Times to come, in Print our shame shall see. But O! bee 't farre from this so famous Isle For Armes and Learning, either to neglect; Sith it doth grace and glory quite exile, And is the cause of many a bad effect. O terren Gods, as ye to State aspire, Lift Learning vp with you; especially If matcht with Wisdom, and divine desire: So shall ye twice be like the Deitie. And, weigh what powr the Pens of such possess (Of such; for others will but gild your Crimes) Their Pens eternize can your worthiness, And make ye glorious past succeeding Times. But you doe iustly to neglect and scorn The cursed crue, that do the Muse abuse: For, they your praises to dispraises turn; As Vice, in praising Vertves grace, doth vse. Their wine-driven braines, inuolv'd in Follies Cloud, Fly heer, and there (and where not?) with a trice? And, though both Beggers base, yet passing proud; Constant in nothing but inconstant Vice: Making loose lines (forsooth) their Scala Cœli; A Tauerne for a Temple to adore Their only god, their guts, their beastly Belly; To whom they offer all their slender Store. The Lauds of such, are odious like their Lives: They (Pitch) pollute what-ere they do but touch; Whose glory to the fowlest shame arrives: Then, well you fence your fame to keep off such. But they whose lives, and lauds, and lines are Sovrce Of Morall vertue, running by each stone (Men High, and Hard; that let them in their Course) To Seas of glory, like cleer Helicon; O! these ye should support, and still receiue Into the Ocean of your bound-less love: For these (like truest Friends) will take, and give No more but what true Vertue shall approve. If these should pine away through your neglect, Your memories shall die, or live with shame; Sith such a Muse is the chiefe Architect, To reare, from Earth to Heav'n, a lasting Name. Achilles fame, with him, had been interr'd, Had Homer's lines not ty'd it to the Stars; And, of Æneas we had never heard, Had Virgils Straines not been his Trumpeters. One of the Nine had been our Warwick's Gvy, (The Nine, whose worth all Times so much commend; And so disrankt great Bvllens Godferey) Had he but had a Tasso for his friend. Lavra had nere so greenly growne aboue Her Peers, as now she doth, to after-times, Had she not had a Petrarch to her Loue; Which made her mount, with Nectar dropping Rimes. No, no: ye cannot but out-live your Fame, If ye vphold not Fame's best Notaries: If these ye scorn, your glory is but game; For, when ye die, in game your glory dies. And, though blest Peace hath turnd our Spears, to Spades, Let it not turn our Pens to Ploughes, or worse; By Learning some should live, as some by Trades, In blessed States, that would incurre no curse. Where Vertue is not rais'd, and Vice supprest, There all to Vice will run; and so to wrack: For, ther the worst shall Lord it ore the best; And where that is, all goes to vtter sack. Reward and Punishment (like Armes of Steel) Do still vphold each King vpholding State: For, neither wants, but it begins to reel; But, both imploy'd, stands sure in spight of Hate. Then may thy Hopes (wingd by thy vertuous Muse) Dear Syluester, expect some cherishment, In this blest State, that still those Armes will vse, To stay her Grace, and grace her Gouernment: But, if thy paines acquire but pure renowne, Thou art Christ's Image, crost, for Glorious crown.

LITTLE BARTAS: OR Briefe Meditations, ON The Power, Providence, Greatnes, and Goodnes of God, In the Creation; of the World, for Man: of Man, For Himself. Translated; &amp; Dedicated To the most Royall Lady Elizabeth, by Iosvah Sylvester. TO THE MOST ROYALL LADY ELIZABETHA, Infanta of England; Princess Palatine of Rhine. Sweet Grace of Graces, Glory of Your Age, Lustre of Vertves (Morall and Divine) Whose Sacred Raies (already) far out-shine Your Princely State, Your Royall Parentage; Heer, to your Highnes (with all Good-Presage, Congratuling Your little Palatine) I consecrate This Little-One of Mine To serve Your Self, first; then, Your Son, for Page. Your gracious Favours to my former Brood, So binde my Thoughts, so bolden my Desires, To shew Mee gratefull, as I knowe You good; That Thus to Yov, This Little Mine aspires: Little in Growth; yet of so great a Spirit, As (happely) Your Graces grace may merit. To your Highness Service, Duly and Truly devoted, Iosvah Sylvester. LITTLE BARTAS. If wanton Lovers so delight to gaze On mortall Beauties brittle little Blaze; That, not content with (almost) daily sight Of those dear Idols of their Appetite; Nor, with th'Idëas which th'Idalian Dart Hath deep imprinted in their yeelding heart; Nor, with Their Pictures (with precisest charge) Done by De-Creets, Marcus, or Peak, at large (And hangd of purpose, where they most frequent, As som fair Chamber's choicest Ornament) They must have Heliard, Isaac, or His Sonne, To doo, in Little, what in Large was done; That they may ever, ever bear about A Pictures Picture (for the most, I doubt): Much more should Those, whose Soules in Sacred Love, Are rapt with Beautie's-Proto-Type above (Sith, heer, they cannot see th'Originall; Nor, in themselves, now, finde his Principall) Thirst for Their Obiect; and [much less content With th'ample Table of the Firmament, And various Visage of this goodly Globe, Wherein, they see but (as it were) His Robe Embrodered rich, and with Great Works embost, Of Powr, of Prudence, and of Goodnes, most; Yet, so farre-off, so massy, so immense, As over-swaies Their weak Intelligence: Or with that lesser Table of their Owne (The Little-World, wherein the Great is show'n) Which, neer and dear, though still about they bear, Such Clouds of Passion are still crowding there, That seld or never can they ought perceive Of those pure Raies it did at first receive] Long for their Long-Home, past the Gates of Grace, To set their Love, in Glory, face to face. Till when; awhile to entertain them heer With Prospects fittest Their faint Thoughts to cheer (In steed of That Great Vniversal Table, Made in Six Daies, with Art so admirable; And, by My Bartas, in His Weeks divine, So large and lively drawn in every line) Du-Val, and I (too short of Isaac's Art) Have Thus Essaid to play the Limners part, And drawe in little (like a Quintessence) That goodly Labours glorious Excellence; For ease of Such, whom Publike Charge denies Leasure to view so large Varieties: And Such, whose Means may not affoord their Mindes So costly Pleasures of so Gain-less kindes: And (lastly) Such, as, loving Bartas best, Would glad and fain still bear Him in their brest, Or in their Bosom, were Hee Pocket-fit, As well Hee might; would Printers Gain permit. Now therfore, Thou, All-forming Only-Trine, As, in the Large, Thou ledst His Hand and Mine; Lend likewise heer Thy gracious Help agen, To guide aright my Pencil and my Pen; To sute my Colours, sweet my Shadowes, so, That This my Little, Thy Great Works may showe. And grant, the-while, I bee not like the Hand Which at S. Albons, in the Street, doth stand Directing Others in the ready Way; But, void of minde, it Self behinde doth stay: Nor like a Buoy, which warneth from a Shelf; But lies still wallowing in the Sea, it Self. Svpernall Lord, Eternall King of Kings, Maker, Maintainer, Mouer of All things, How infinite! How excellently-rare! How absolute Thy wondrous Works they are! How-much Their Knowledge is to be desir'd! How, THOV, in All, to be of All admir'd! Thy glorious Powr so suits thy gracious Will: Thy soverain Wisdom meets thy Goodnes still: Thy Word effects thy Work; and, void of Pain, Turns round the Heav'ns, and doth the Earth sustain. Thy Spirit, infallible and infinite, Filling the World (yet not contain'd in it) By Powr and Presence, all, in All things dwels; In Essence though, the Heav'n of Heav'ns excels. Eternally, before All Form began, Thou, onely God, wert in Thy-self, even than, As absolute, as after all the Term Of All thy Works: They, Changefull All; Thou firm. The Revolution of This ample All, Heav'ns height, Starres light, the Oceans flood and fall, To all Mankinde, in som kinde, make Thee known; But adde not Thee more Glory to Thine Owne. To make a World, or marr it, Thou art free. All coms and goes by Thy divine Decree. Thou, at Thy pleasure, hast made All of Nought: All, at Thy pleasure, shall to Nought bee brought. Thy Name is (right) I AM: for, without Thee, Is None: all Beeings of Thy Beeing bee: All perfect Vnity, proper Existence, Is onely found in Thine owne sacred Essence. Although the World a goodly Peece appeer, 'T hath, to Thy Greatnes, no Proportion neer: 'T is but a Point to Thine immense Infinity. Then, what (alas!) is Man to Thy Divinity? Yet, hast thou Him a Tongue and Reason giv'n; And Eyes erected towards Thy glittering Heav'n, To read and ruminate Thy Wonders there; And afterwards proclaim them every-where. The Heav'ns declare Thy Glory, and they preach To Man, Thy Works, Thine Excellence in Each: The Elements accorded Discords sound How good for vs thy goodly Works are found. The radiant Stars, in their eternall Sway, Th'alternate Changes of the Night and Day, The birth of Beasts, the growth of Plants, each hour, Teach every where Thy Providence and Powr. From Thee, the Sun receives his Beauty bright, And Soverain Rule of Each celestiall Light; Whose Yearly Course, in certain Circuiting, Makes Winter, Sommer, Autumn, and the Spring. Bee 't cloudy, cleer, Eclipse, or Night, or Day; His lovely brows are equi-lucent ay: And, whether swift or soft Hee seem to wend, His Speed is such, Wee cannot comprehend. Though vs Hee Warm, yet is Himself not hot: Though red, or pale, Hee seem, yet is Hee not: Though small to vs; His Orb is eight-score times And six, as big as All our Earthly Climes. Did not Hee draw moist Vapours from belowe, To drench our Fields; heer, nothing green would growe: Did not Hee dry excessive Showrs again, Wee could not sowe, nor mowe; our Grass, nor Grain. Thou, Lord, by Him, work'st all this Alteration; And causest so All Creatures generation: Prankest the Earth in diverse-Flowred hew; And Yearly, almost, mak'st the World anew. Thou hast dispos'd His oblique Body so, That, Rise hee, Set hee; bee hee High, or Lowe; His Noon's perpetuall: and hee makes at-once Day, Night; Summer/Winter; frying, freezing Zones. When lowe to Vs, to Others hee is hie; When Others see not, Wee behould his Eie; When heer hee Sets, hee Rises other-where; When heer direct, hee looketh glancing there. When som, in Summer, hear sweet Nightingales, Then som, in Winter, hear but blustring Gales: Som see but Buds, when som supply their Granges: Each-where, the Sun thus Seasons contre-changes. When heer, there springs both leaf and grass together, Else-where the Meads doo hang their heads, and wither: So, in their turns, so in their times, hee measures His Gifts to all; and all partake his Treasures. In brief: each change of short, long; Day and Night; Of Seasons, Times, Turns, and Returns of Light; Which, in a whole Yeer, every-where hee forms; That, in the whole World, daily Hee performs. So that, drad Lord, were not Thy sacred Lore, Man, above All, would likely Him adore (As som have don); but Supreme Reason showes, That all His Glory vnto Thine hee owes. Things finite have Beginning and Beginner: Things mov'd, a Mover (as, the wheel, the Spinner); Effects, their finall Cause; and (formally) Elder then Time, Nature or Faculty. Even Thee, the Cause of Causes: Sourse of All: First, and Last, Moover: Prime, and Principall: Infallible, involuble, insensible; All Self-comprising, else incomprehensible: Immense, Immortall, absolute Infinity, Omnipotent, Omniscient Divinity. Even Thee, in Whom alone begins all Good, And all returns into thy bound-less Flood. By Order then of thy Decrees divine, Th'hast set the Sun o'r all the World to shine; And (as the Subjects lightly suit their King) With His fair Light, t'enlighten every thing. His goodly Face, th'vngodly ever fly, Seeking for Night's black horrid Canapy To cover Theft, Rape, Incest, Murder too, And all foul Sinnes; which, in the Dark, they doo. By Him, Wee see Thy Works in their Propriety; Discern their Beauties, learn their vast variety: Where, without Him, the World would all return To th'old first Chaos, or in Blindnes mourn. By Him, Wee calculate our Grandsires Dates, Th'Increase of Kingdoms, and Decay of States: By Him, Thou measur'st, Lord, to Vs and Ours, Yeers, Ages, Seasons, Months, Daies, Minutes, Hours. All Wits admire th'immense and wondrous way His great bright Body circuits every Day: The more his Orb is from the Centre far, The longer Daily his great Iournies are. Besides his Daily Course, his Coursers drive One of three hundred threescore Daies and five, Five Hours, three Quarters: of which Over-plus, In every fourth Year, growes a Day with vs. Yet, whoso would the Year exactly rate, In five-score-five Years, must one Leap abate; And, in threescore, for th'Error ready past, Should no Bissextile in our Books bee plaç't. But, though Wee erre, Hee never errs at all: Nor, since Thou didst Him in his State install, Hath Hee mist Moment of the Task hee ought; Though hee have seen Men fail and fall so oft. Above all Creatures, Hee retains, of Thee, Som-thing conform to Thine Eternity: For, though Hee see our hourly Changes heer, His Light and Beauty still the same appeer. How many Changes hath Hee seen on Earth! Kings, Kingdoms, States; their Buriall, and their Birth; Rising and Falling of triumphant Races; Raising and Razing of renowned Places? How often hath Hee seen Empires reverst? Rich Cities sackt? Rare Common-weals disperst? Fields turn'd to Floods, and Seas return'd to Sands, While stedfast Hee between his Tropiks stands? Him, just betwixt Six Wand'rers hast Thou plaç't, Which prance about Him with vnequall haste: All which, without Him, could no Light reflect, As is apparant by the Moons Defect. By His Aspect, her Owne shee daily makes: Shee, Wax-less, Wane-less, doth both wane and wax: And, though to Vs Shee seem a Semi-Ray, Her full round Face doth never fall away. By His fair Beams, as well by Day as Night, The full whole Half of Her thick Orb is bright: And, as Shee draws neer or far-off from Him; So, more or less, Our Half is cleer or dim. Her vpper Half is full in her Coïtion, Her lower Half is in her Opposition: Her other Quarters other Forms express; And, vp or down-ward, shew Her, more or less. When Wee see little, then the Heav'ns have store: When Heav'ns see little, then have Wee thee more: Neerer the Sun, the lesse Shee seems in sight; Turning her Horn still to her Opposite. At Even, Increasing, Shee the Sun succeeds; At Morn, Decreasing, Shee his Car preceeds: So that, each Month the Sun environs Her, On every side His Splendor to confer. Her silver Light then onely faileth her When th'Earth's between Them (in Diameter): Which Masks her Beauty, with a sable Cloud, From Sight of Him, her Brother Golden-browd. Good Lord, what changes doost Thou work by These Varieties; in Air, in Earth, and Seas! Fair, or foul Weather; Winde, or Wet, or Thunder; To dry, or drip; or cool, or warm Heer-vnder. If Shee but smile the fourth day, 't will bee fair: If then Shee blush, wee shall have blustring air: If then her brows bee muffled with a Frown, Most of that Month shall sad Tears trickle down. Thus doth the Vigour of the Signs superiour Rule in the Vertues of these things inferiour: But All are govern'd by Thy soverain Might: O! happy Hee who vnderstands it right. Thrice happy Hee, who sees Thee every-where; In Heav'n and Earth, in Water, Fire, and Air: Who, due admiring Thy wise Works (of Yore) Thee above All, Thee onely, doth adore. Who knowes Thee so, so needs must love Thee too; And, with his Will, Thy sacred Will would doo; Still lifts his Eyes to Heav'n-ward, to contemple The stately Wonders of Thy starry Temple: Admires the set and measur'd Dance of Thine All-clasping Palace, azure-crystalline, Rare-rich-imbost with glittering studs of Gold; And, more admires, the more hee doth behold. 'T's a wondrous thing to see That mighty Mound, Hinge-less and Ax-less, turn so swiftly round; And th'heavy Earth, prop-less (though downward tending) Self-counter-poiz'd, 'mid the soft Air suspending. On th'ample Surface of whose massie Ball, Men (round about) doo trample over all, Foot against Foot, though still (O strange Effect!) Their Faces all bee towards Heav'n erect. Those dwelling vnder th'Equinoctiall, they Have, all the Year long, equall Night and Day: Those neer the Tropiks, have them more vn-even; The more, the more that they are Nor-ward driven. But Those, whose Tents to either Pole are neer, Have but One Night, and One Day, in a yeer. Yet All well compast by due ruled Rite, Neither, then other, hath more Dark or Light. Thus have thy Works, O All-Disposing Deïty, Som-what conform, for all their great variety: Which Harmony, amid so diverse things, In All, aloud Thy wondrous Wisdom rings. But, specially, wee wonder at the Place Which heer thou hast bestow'd on Adams race: To see our selves set on so Round a Ball, So firmly hangd just in the midst of all. For, This our Globe hangs Prop-less in the Air; Yet, but thy Self, can nothing shake or sway-her: No roaring Storm, nor rumbling Violence, Can move the Centre's sad Circumference. Which, whoso should oppose in Disputation, Might bee convinç't by easie Demonstration: So far doo they from Sense and Reason erre, Who think the Heav'ns stand, and the Earth doth stir. The Parts and Whole of same-kinde bodies, have Same or like Motions; bee they light, or grave; Vpward, or downward; round, or overthwart: Needs must the Totall move as doth his Part. So, if wee see the Sunne and Moon to veer; Their ample Heav'ns have even the like Career: But, who hath seen a Selfly-turning Stone? How then should Earth turn her whole lump alone? Let's therefore, boldly, with old Truth, affirm, That th'Earth remains vnmoveable and firm: And (if wee credit the Geometer) Three thousand leagues is her Diameter: This Measure of her vast thick Depth, is found By th'admirable Compass of her Round; Which hath, by Test of Arts Experiments, More then nine thousand leagues Circumference. Yet, learned Mappists, on a Paper small, Draw (in Abbridgement) the whole Type of All; And, in their Chamber (pain-less, peril-less) See, in an hour, and circuit, Land and Seas. This mighty Globe is but a Point, compar'd With th'vpper Globe: yet on this Point are shar'd Millions of millions of Man-kinde, which plow With Keel and Coultar its Twin Back and Brow. Man, placed thus, in This Mid-Point, so even, Sees alwaies Half of God's great Hall of Heav'n: Th'other's beneath him; yet abides not there, But in a Day doth to him all appear. Ah, Soverain Artist! O how few of vs Knowe right the Place where Thou hast plaç't vs thus! Alas! how many knowe not, to what end Thy gracious Wisdom did them hither send! Yet, giving Man a quick Intelligence, Thou sett'st him just in the World's Midst; that, thence Seeing thy Wonders round about him so, Knowing himself, hee might Thee better knowe. By th'vsuall Circuit of the Heav'nly Ball, The Stars appear vnto vs (almost) all; That Wee, in time, observing all their Figures, Might contemplate their Courses, Natures, Vigors. To view the Stars, is honest Recreation: To search their Course, deserveth Commendation; So wee beware, with some presuming Sects To pick things future out of their Aspects. Wee must renounce That Errors patronage, That what som Dreamers by our Births presage, Must needs betide vs; tying to their Lawes Our nature, govern'd by a Higher Cause. Perhaps the Signes some inclination bring, Inducing hearts to som Affectioning: But, by Gods grace, well may wee vary that; As, never forç't by necessary Fate. For, sure if Man, by strong Necessity, Doo any Ill, ill meriteth not Hee: Did Stars constrain vs; neither Vertue, then, Nor Vice, were worth Praise or Reproof in Men. If any way the Will of Man bee free, On These Effects what Iudgement's ground can bee? What Certainty can from the Stars bee knowne Of Weal, or Woe, Life, Death, or Thrall, or Throne? When Kings are born, many are born beside: Must all bee Destin'd to bee Kings, that tide? Oft, many at-once are hangd, or drown'd, or slain: Did all at-once their groaning Mothers pain? Who can conceive, that such or such Aspect Is good, or bad; boads Life, or Deaths Effect? Who can produce so sure Prognostications Of our frail Life, so full of Alterations? Certain's that Art which shewes the daily Course Of restless Stars, their influence and force: But, Divination's an vncertain Skill, Full of fond Errour, false, and failing still. What booted, Lord, our humblest Vowes to Thee, Were their Conclusions certain Verity? Disastrous Fate would mate vs with Despair, And frustrate all religious Faith and Praier. Were it their Sayings were right certain true, Then, of necessity must all ensue: But, if Events their Verdicts often thwart, False is their Aim, and fallible their Art. Observe the Works those subtile Authors write; Th'are so ambiguous, or so false out-right, That if somtimes som Truth they chance to hit, They'll counterpoiz a hundred lies for it. Too-busie-bold with Thee, Lord, they presume; And to themselves Thine Office they assume, Who, by Star-gazing, or ought else belowe, Dare arrogate the Future to fore-knowe. Wee hardly see what hangeth at our Eies: How should wee read the Secrets of the Skies? None knowes, To-morrow what betide him shall: How then fore-tell Yeers Fortunes yer they fall? Then leave wee All to God's high Providence; Not list'ning for To-morrow-Daies Events: Better then Wee, Hee knowes what's meet to send. Then fear wee nothing, but Him to offend. O! Thou All-knower! Nothing more doth thrust Proud Man from Thee, then This Ambitious Lust Of knowing All: for, by that Arrogance, In stead of Knowledge, got Hee Ignorance. Man nothing knowes, nor nothing comprehends, But by the Power which Thy pure Spirit him lends. If then, Thy Wisdom have so bounded His; Why would Hee hold more then His Measure is? Let's humbly stoop our Wits, with all Sincerity, Vnto Thy Word: there let vs seek the Verity: And all Predictions that arise not Thence, Let vs reject for impious Insolence. Let vs repute all Divination vain, Which is derived from mans fuming brain, By Lots, by Characters, or Chyromancy; By Birds, or Beasts, or damned Necromancy. Let's also flee the furious-curious Spell Of those Black-Artists that consult with Hell To finde things lost; and Pluto's help invoke For hoorded Gold, where oft they finde but smoke. Hee's fond that thinks Fiends in his Ring to coop, Or in a knife them by a Charm to hoop. Such as have try'd those Courses, for the most, Have felt in fine Their malice, to their cost. Woe, woe to Them that leave the living God, To follow Fiends, and Montibanks abroad; Seeking, for Light, dark, dreaming Sorceries; And, for the Truth, th'erroneous Prince of Lies. Condemning therefore all pernicious Arts, Let's bee contented with our proper Parts: Let's meekly seek what may bee safely knowne, Without vsurping God's peculiar Owne. W' have Stuff enough (besides) our time to spend; And Our short life can hardly comprehend The half of half the Wonders licenst vs To search, and knowe, and soberly discuss. The smallest Garden vsually contains Roots, Fruits and Flowrs, sufficient for the pains Of one man's life, their natures to descry: When will hee knowe all Creatures property? Earth's but a Point, compar'd to th'vpper Globe: Yet, who hath seen but half her vtter Robe, Omitting All her Inwards, All her Water? When shall wee then see All this vast Theater? What heer wee see, wee see, is Exquisite: What's This to That so far above our Sight? Excelling fair, what to our Ey is sensible: Even to our Soule, the rest's incomprehensible. Who then can vaunt himself Omniscient? More, then All, sin-less, Pure and Innocent? As none's all-guiltless in thy glorious Eyes, Ther's none all-knowing thy high Mysteries. Yet must wee praise and glorifie thee fit, For that wee knowe; and for our good by it: There is no Pleasure can bee comparable To Contemplation of Thy Wondrous Table. Thereon the more wee muse, the more wee may; So our Delight, Desire increaseth ay Of finding Thee: and that divine Desire, Calming our Cares, quencheth our fleshly Fire. All other Pleasures have Displeasures mixt: Ioyes meet Annoyes, and Smiles have Tears betwixt: Yea, all Delights of Earth have ever been Fellow'd or follow'd, by som tragick Teen. But, Who of Thee, and Thine, contemplates ever, Scapes all the Fits of th'hot-cold cruell Fever Of Fear, of Love, of Avarice, Ambition, Which haunts all others, with small Intermission. Man, labour-less, receives a rare Delight, When hee observes the settled Order right, Whereby all Creatures (with, or wanting, Sense) Subsist, through thine Vnchanging Providence. What more Content can Wee have heer belowe, More high, more happy? then, but This to knowe (This certain Sum) That, when This World began, Thou mad'st Man for Thy-Self, and All for Man. Th'Horse was not made to glorifie thy Name, Nor th'Elephant to magnifie the same: Man, onely Man, hath memory, voice, and wit To sing thy Praise, and sound thy Glory, fit. And, to serve Thee, as Hee is sole ordain'd; So, to serve Him, Thou hast the rest derrain'd: All things that flee, that walk, that craul, or swim, Yea, Heav'n and Earth, and All, are vow'd to Him. For Him, the Earth yeelds Herbs, Trees, Fruits &amp; Flowrs, (To sundry purpose, and of sundry powrs) Corn of all kindes, in Vallies far and wide (For Bread and Drink) and dainty Vines beside. For Him, the Rocks a thousand Rivers gush: Heer, rouling Brooks; There, silver Torrents rush; Indenting Meads and Pastures, as they pass, Whose smiling Pride peeps in their liquid Glass. For Him, the Mountains, Downs and Forrests, breed Buffs, Beefs, Sheep, Venzon; and the lusty Steed To bear him bravely thorough thick and thin; And silly Worms, his Silken Robes to spin. For Him, the Bullock bears his painfull Yoak: For Him, the Weather wears his curled Cloak: For Him, the Birds their brooding-chambers build: For Him, the Bees their Wax and Hunny yeeld. For Him, the Sea doth many millions nurse; With whom, the Air helps both his panch and purse: The Fire's His Cook, to dress th'aboundant Cheer Which Air, and Sea, and Earth, doo furnish heer. Yea, Dragons, Serpents, Vipers venemous, Have Fel, Fat, Blood; or somwhat good for vs; In Leprosie, or Lunacie, apply'd: And Triacle is also hence supply'd. Hee (briefly) Hee hath vse of all that is; Winnes the most savage of the Savages: None so fierce Lion, but to tame hee wonts; Nor Elephant so high, but that hee mounts; And makes, besides, of his huge Bones and Teeth, Hafts, Boxes, Combs; and more then many see'th. Nay, more: for Him, the fell Monocerote, Bears on his Brow a soverain Antidote. Yea, many soverain Remedies Hee findes, For sundry Griefs, in Creatures of All kindes. All (in a word) Wilde and Domestick too, Som way or other, Him som service doo. For Food, Hee hath the Flesh of Beasts and Birds: For Clothes, the Fleece, the Hair and Hide of Heards: For House, each Quarr, and every Forrest, offers: For Metalls, Mines furnish his Camp and Coffers. For Him, the jarring Elements agree: Fire cleers the Air: Air sweeps the Earth, wee see: Earth bears the Water: Water (moistly-milde) Cools Fire, calms Air, and gets the Earth with-childe. So, All is made for Man; and Man, for Thee: To love, and serve and laud Thy Majesty; Thee above All, Thee onely, to obay; With Thankfull Soule walking Thy sacred Way. This doth Hee well, that yeelds his Will to Thine; Full of Desires, if not of Deeds, divine: Striving to stoop, vnder the Spirits Awe, The members stubborn and rebellious Lawe. For, Man consists of discordant accords (What the great World, the little World affords. There Heav'n and Earth; Heer Earth and Heav'n ther are; There War and Peace; Heer also Peace and War). Hee hath a Heav'nly Soule, an Earthly Sheath: That, soars above: This, ever pores beneath: That, lightly-wingd, All Creatures comprehends; This, leaden-heel'd, but to Corruption tends. The Spirit oft against the Flesh doth fight; And somtimes, vanquisht by his Opposite, Is carried Captive with the most Dishonor, After his Foe; and forç't to wait vpon-her; Till rouz'd again, and raised by Thy Grace, His striving Will recovers wonted place; With better Watch, and braver Resolution, To stand it out, vntill his Dissolution. Survaying then both Heav'n and Earth about, He bringeth in, what hee hath seen without; And, marking well th'Effects of natures visible, Ascends by those vnto their Cause invisible. For, but two Organs hath our Soule, whereby To finde and knowe th'eternall Majesty: Faith, which beleeves the sacred Word of GOD; And Reason, reading all His Works abroad. Those Wonders send vs, to their Author, over; Those certain Motions, to their certain Mover: Then Faith conducts vs, where our Reason leaves; And, what th'Ey sees not, That our Faith conceives. Faith, firm and lively, doth our Soules perswade, That, Thy high Powr, of Nothing, All hath made: Thine Essence is Eternally-Divine: The World Beginning had, and shall have Fine. Wee must not say, Of Nought is formed Nought (Although to Man it may bee justly brought). Th'eternall Spirit can All, of Nought, produce; And instantly, to Nothing, All reduce. Nor may wee ask, What th'Eviternall-One, That space-less Space, could finde to doo alone. His Three-One-Self to knowe and to partake, Is (Count-less) more then Thousand Worlds to make. A passing Artist is no less Compleat, Then in Composure, in his rare Conceit: For, in the Knowledge, Art's perfection lies; And, Works deferd vail not the Work-mans Prize. The Minde's not idle, though the Hand awhile Vse neither Pen, Pencil, nor Gouge, nor File. The Minde's before the Work; and works within, Vpon th'Idea, yer the Deed begin. Would wee not say, the World were God indeed, If from no other it did first proceed? Eternall, onely is GOD's proper tearm; Alone preceeding Time, exceeding Term. The World supports not Thee, nor Thee supplies: Thou doost Thy-Self sustain, Thy-Self suffize: And grosly erres who-ever shall suppose, Thee, Infinite, within a World to close. And, as wee may not match the Heav'ns Extense Vnto Thy Circle, infinite, immense: No more may wee, to Thine Eternal-Age, Compare the Worlds short, brittle Little Age, Before All Time, Thou, Everlasting-One, Decreedst in time, to make the Sun and Moone. The Worlds few Dayes and ill (with little cumber) Thy sacred Book will teach vs soon to number. What Book, what Brass, what Marble, ought can showe But of an hundred-Thousand Yeers ago? Had Man been Heer, from an eternall Line, Heer must have been (sure) som perpetuall Signe: Of Years, Millions of Millions must have past From th'end-less Clue of th'eviternall-Vast: In all these Yeers, of all that did survive, Of all their Acts, could None to Vs arrive? Wee hear (and often) of the Babylonians, Medes, Persians, Grecians, Romans, Macedonians: But, Where's the Nation, Whose Renowned Glory Hath liv'd a hundred-thousand Yeers in Story? Seek All (Greek, Latin, Hebrew) Authors, round, Of All, will Moses bee the Senior found. Who (to His Times) in express tearms hath cast Th'age of the World, with the Descents that past. Now, from His Daies to Ours, what Yeers amount, Wee may with ease within few Hours account; And, adding Both, soon by the Total, finde Th'age of the World, and of Our crooked Kinde. Five thousand yeers, five hundred, forty eight, This Yeer are past; since first This World took Date: 1620. Since all the Heav'ns, Fire, Water, Air and Earth, Had, by thy Word, their Being, and their Birth. Then was the Heav'ns azure Pavilion spred, And with Spur-Royalls spangled over head: Then those Twin-Princes, with their Train of Light, Began their Kingdoms over Day and Night. Then was the Air, the Earth and Sea, repleat With Birds and Beasts, and Fishes, small and great: With Plants, and Trees, and Fruits; each yeelding seed To propagate their Kindes that should succeed. Then (lastly) Man, thy Master-Piece of Art, Thou didst appoint to His Imperiall Part; Innobling Him with Sense and Reason's Light, And in his Soule, graving Thine Image right: Gav'st Him Possession of this Earthly Throne, And gracious Promise of the Heav'nly One: Immortall Soule, thou daign'dst him to inspire, Equall (almost) to thine Owne Heav'nly-Quire. And, as Thy Spirit all other Spirits excells (Angell, or other that in Body dwells): So doth his Body all else Bodies passe For comely Form, and for Majestike Face. All Creatures else lowe on the ground doo pore, And groveling feed: but (as was toucht before) Man hath an Vpright and a stately Stature, With head aloft, agreeing to his nature; Which, properly, is to behould the Skies, To lift to Thee his Heart, his Hand, his Eies: And by his Soule's discursive powr to peiz Things past, and present, and of future daies. For, onely Man can measure, number, waigh; True, False, Good, Evill; knowe, cast, sound, survay. Man onely hath an in-reflecting Knowledge Of his owne Self (from Natures onely Colledge): Knowes his owne fact, his form, his load, his strength; Knowes that hee lives, knowes hee must dy (at length): And, that a ruled sober life, and sage, Preserves his Health, and may prolong his Age: Knowes how to finde ease in his owne Disease; And, if need bee, his Neighbour to appease: And, for himself and others, make, of Flowrs Fruits, Herbs and Roots, Vnguents of passing powrs. But, none so powrfull (when his Term is spent) As can his Owne or others death prevent: For, Our short Date (Childe-age, or Wilde-age) ends; And now but seldom to Old-age extends. Yet, what is Old-age to ETERNITY? To Man, expecting IMMORTALITY, What is't to live som Three or Fourescore Yeer; Or yet Ten more (in Languor) linger heer? Of all our Time-past, vnderneath the Sunne, Nothing remains, save Good or Evill done: Hundreds of Yeers, once past, are less (in Sum) Then a few Daies, or a few Hours to-come. For, to say Truth, of Times three-pointed Powrs, Onely the Present (instant) Point is ours. W'have, of the Past, but vain Imagination; Of that To-com, but doubtfull Expectation. But, to th'Eternall, are All Times, alike Instant; and present, Dead as well as Quick: Ay is To-Day with Thee: Lord, in Thy Sight, Both Past and Future are even equall bright. Though in Times Terms the Heav'ns revolved bee; A Thousand Yeers are but One Day with Thee: And shortest Moment of One onely Day With Thee is as a Thousand Yeers (for ay). But, Our set Daies, to vs, are long, or short; As them, good Accidents, or bad, consort: Sobriety and Peace prolong our Life: Which is abbridg'd by Surfet and by Strife. Excess, or Cares, now, so cut-off our lives, That, of a thousand, not a man arrives Neer to the Tythe of the admired Age Of those that liv'd in Natures Pupillage; Eight hundred Years; nine hundred, som; som, more; In Minde and Body, full of Natures store; To stock the Earth with Issue rationall, And learn the Course of Heav'ns Star-spangled Ball: Which, first of all, Their long observance found: Then, by degrees, they taught their Heirs the ground: And Wee, from Them (so eas'd of end-less pain) Derive that Art, Wee could not else attain. In their long Age they learn'd Heav'ns full Careers (Not to bee compast in our Span of Yeers) Whence, One of them might in his life knowe more, Then, in our Daies, successiuely, a score. Of Their so long Age whoso doubtfull is, Let him but look in sacred Genesis: Where Moses mentions divers famous men So old; and shewes their Yeers as ours were then. Th'all-drowning Flood-year did twelve Months contain, And every Month did his due Daies retain: Which made vp one Yeer of that Patriarch, Who liv'd seav'n fifties, having left the Ark; And was Six hundred when hee came aboord: Teaching his Sons his wondrous Skill, by word. See, see, (alas!) how our vnhappy Life Is now abbridg'd, and charg'd with Mischiefs rife. Had wee not pleasure in thy Works, O GOD, Soon must wee sink vnder the heavie Load Of Cares and Crosses (in a thousand things) Which this, our wretched, sad, short, Way-fare brings. O! let vs therefore bend our best and most To magnifie Thee, Lord, in All thine Host: And so, contempling all thy Goodnes giv'n, With true Content, begin (in Earth) our Heav'n. Man, knowing Thee, knowes all that can bee known: And, having Thee, hath all that is, his Owne: To long for Thee, is endless Ioy, internall: Dispos'd to Thee, to Dy, is Life Eternall. Not knowing Thee; to Live, is daily Dying: To rest without Thee, is continuall Flying: But all extreams of Torments passing measure, In Thee, and for Thee, are exceeding Pleasure. Yet, no man ought to offer wilfull Force To his owne Self; nor his owne Soule divorce: But patiently attend Thy cheerfull Call; Then, to Thy hands gladly surrender all. Nor may Wee ween our Soules (as Beasts) to Dy; And with our Bodies Vanish vtterly: Death's but a Passage from a Life of Pains, Vnto a Life where death-less Ioy remains. W' have, after Death, another Life to see: As, after Storms, a calm and quiet Lee: As, after Sicknes, Health: as, after Durance, Sweet Liberty, with Safety and Assurance. Two Contraries, oppos'd, in their Extream, Have This vnfailing Property in them; That th'One's Privation is the others Ens: So, Death, concluding, doth our Life commence. For, on each-other, Contraries depend, Chain'd (as it were) vnto each others End: Day after Night: Attonement after Strife: And, after mortall Death, immortall Life. Our Soule's immortall then (wee must infer-it) Having beginning of th'Immortall Spirit: And they are brute (as Beasts) that doo contend, That with our Bodies, Soules for ever end. If there bee GOD immortall, All-scient, All-mighty, just, benign, benevolent; Where were his Wisdom, Goodnes, Iustice, Power, If Vice Hee damn not, nor give Vertue Dower? Heer, for the most, the Godly suffer still: Th'Vngodly heer have most the Winde at Will: Shall they not one-day change their Difference? And one-day look for Diverse Recompence? Heer, Proud, Rich, Mighty; Meek, Poor, Weak, oppress: Lions kill Lambes; Fox strips the Fatherless: O! is there not another Life imperible, Sweet, to the Guiltless; to the Guilty, Terrible? Who, for Thy sake, their Liues haue sacrifiz'd, In all the Torments Tyrants haue deviz'd; O! how vnhappy were They, were there not Crowns kept with Thee, for their Eternall Lot! Then were We Beasts, or worse then Beasts, indeed: For He were best that could the worst exceed. Then, Let vs eat, drink, dally, might We say: If, after This, there were no Shot to pay. But leaving now that Song of Sensuality, Beleeue we firm our blessed Immortality; Blessed for Those, that, in Perseverance, To Thee alone (Lord) their whole Hopes advance. Blessed for Those, who, in sincere Humility, Acknowledging, as knowing their Debility; Through th'old Corruption of all Adams race: Them-selues distrusting, only trust Thy Grace. Thou, Lord (alas!) know'st all our Imperfections, Our vain Desires, our mutable Affections, How prone we are to fall; how Wilde, how Wood, Pursuing Evill, and eschewing Good. Th'incessant Sway of our continuall Ill, Requires the Grace of thy prevention still; And th'odious Fruits our Nature wonts to breed, Lord, of Thy Mercies haue continuall need. Of frailty therefore, when our foot shall slip, Or sway, or stray, or turn-awry, or trip; Yet flat We fall, vouchsafe thy helping hand, To raise vs then; and make vs, after, stand. For, without Thee, our Force is Feebleness; Our Wisdome Folly; Will is Waywardness: Our Knowledge, Ignorance; our Hope Despaire: Our Faith but Phansie, and our All but Aire. Without Thee, Lord, meer Idols are we all; W' haue Eyes, but see not: Feet, but cannot craul: Ears, but we hear not: Senses with-out Sense: Soules with-out Soule, with-out Intelligence. Without Thee, all our Counsails and Designes Are but as Chaffe before the boysterous Windes; Our Preparations quickly come to nought; Our Enterprises vanish with a Thought. Without Thee, boot neither our Foot, nor Horse; From Thee alone all things deriue their force: Thou only givest Vertue, Wisdome, Wealth, Peace, Honour, Courage, Victory, and Health. Thou holdst the hearts of Princes in thy hand: Their Strength and State is all at thy Command: No Chance of Warre, no Power, no Policie; But, Changeless, Thou giv'st Losse, or Victory. By Thee King's raign; bound, equally to all To waigh iust Iustice, both to Great and Small; To reach the good their Sceptre's helpfull Vigour; And teach the Lewd their Swords severest Rigour. Who Them reiect, or Their iust Lawes repugne; Thine Honor, and Thine Ordinance impugne. They owe their Subiects, Iustice and Defence; Their Subiects Them, Honor, Obedience. Each ought to pay Them (in degree, and manner) Tribute, where Tribute; Honor, to whom Honor; And, to their People, They their best Protection, And Each his Owne; without mis-fond Affection: And think themselues (the while) thy Subiects too, And bound the more thy sacred Lore to doo: To shew the more Their Vertues Excellence, The more their Charge is, and their Eminence. Iustice due Dooms slackly to execute, Makes some Disloyall, others Dissolute: Some too-outrageous, in Wrongs greediness, Others (on th'other side) in all Excess. T'hath oft been seen (and in Our Times and Climes) Good Princes smart for wicked Peoples Crimes: And somtimes also for their Princes Sin, Subiects are plagued outward and within. But, O! how highly happy is the Land Where a iust Prince doth Prudently command! And where the People in a Loue-bred Awe, Pay willing Service, and Obey the Lawe. O happy! both, People and Prince (in fine) Where both obey Thy sacred Lawes divine: Who grately vsing Blessings great and small; Acknowledge Thee Owner and Lord of All. Of Thee, in Fee, all Princes of the Earth Hold their Estates, Goods, Honors, Being, Birth; And, without Thee, can neither keep, nor get, Least point of Honour, nor of Earth least bit. Their Arcenals, without Thee are but vain, Their Hoords of Treasure, and their Heaps of Grain: 'Tis vaine, without Thee, to affie in Force Of Men, Munition, Champions, Charrets, Horse. Without Thee, Order is dis-orderd soon, Valour soon vanquisht, Policy vndone, Number but Cumber: and a multitude Of beaten Souldiers, beaten by few rude. Thou, at thy pleasure, mak'st the deepest Sea Divide it Self, to giue Thy Servants Way: And suddenly, again it selfe to close, To over-whelm Thine and Their stubborn Foes. Thou, from the Rock mak'st plentious Rivers spout, For Thine to drink, in sandy Desarts drought. And, there, from Heav'n send'st them exceeding store Of Quailes, for meat, till they can eat no more. Thou fedst them there, with Angels bread (a while) And gav'st them then a Milk-&amp;-Hony Soyle: There, without stroak to conquer in the Field; And, Mine-less make their tumbling Wals to yeeld. To shew the vse and power of humble prayer; And How to Thee behooues vs still repaire: While heart and hands Moses to Heav'n doth strain, Renowned Iosvah Conquers in the Plain. Thou, at thy pleasure, mak'st the Sun to stay; And, without Night, to make one Double Day: To giue thy Servants compleat Victory; And ever-raze their Foes foul memory. Thou, to expresse thy Power (in Gedeons Raign) Hast by Three hundred, Six-Score Thousand slain: And, by One man, one Goad-groom (Silly Sangar) Destroy'd Six hundred, in religious anger. Thou canst in One a Thousands strength compress, And place it strangely in his slender Tress: Which, cut, he lost, and then re-grown, regain'd; And dying, more then living, Foes he brain'd. Thou turn'dst to grass, a King of Babylon: And setst a Shepheard on a Regall Throne. Thou slew'st a Giant, by a gentle Lad, Who, for a Pistol, but a Pebble had. How-many Troubles had that Prophet-Prince! For happy Service, hatefull Recompence; Through Hill and Dale, hunted from place to place: Yet, still preserv'd by thine assisting grace; And set, at last, vpon his Masters Throne, Subduing all civill and forain Foen: Then, in Thine Honour warbles many a Psalm; And, hoary, leaues his Son, his Kingdom calm. By Thee, His Sonne, renowned Salomon, Obtain'd the Name of Wisedoms Paragon: For, asking onely That, Thou gav'st Him Wealth, Honor and Peace withall, and Power and Health. And, as good Princes thus Thou doost advance; So bringst thou down fell Tyrants Arrogance: Such as, transported in their Pride extreame, Dare wrong Thy Saints, or Thy drad Self blaspheme. Senacherib must This confesse, and rew, With nine-score-Thousand which thine Angel slew, Of his proud Hoast; besides th'vnkindly Slaughter Of his owne Self, by his owne Sonnes, soon after. So, That Baal-blinded, blood-soild, Sin-sold Pair (In whose sad Dayes the Zealfull Thesbits Praier, For Seav'n Six-Months, seald-vp thy heav'nly deaws) Thy Power, Truth, Iustice, in Their Iudgement shews. Oft-times thy Hook hales moody Tyrants back; Oft-times themselues by their owne Swords to wrack: Some-times, by Womens weak vnwarlike hands, Thou conquer'st Captains, and confoundst their Bands. Yea, Lord, at all times, in extreamest Straights, Thy sacred Arme, or Secret Army, waits, To succour Thine (from Famine, Sword, and Fire; And all the Plots that Foes, or Fiends, conspire) And them, so daily, to supply, support (Their Wants, their Weakness) in so various sort, That, all thy Wonders of this kinde to count, Even past Examples, past all Numbers mount. But, All thy Mercies, vnto All, and Each Of thine Elect; What Words, what Thoughts can reach! What Thou hast said, and done vnto Thy Vine, Thy Loue, Thy Doue, that little Flock of Thine! To whom Thou spakest divers wayes of old; In Visions, Dreames, Types, Figures manifold; By Priests and Prophets; sealing oft thine Oracles Of Wrath, or Mercy; with respectiue Miracles. And last of all, when Times full Term was run, Sent'st vs from Heav'n Thine Owne and onely Son; Whom coeternall GOD Thou didst ingender, Thine owne grauen Image, Thine owne Glories splendor; Th'Eternall Word, by Whom, when All began, Thou madest All; and since, remadest Man: The Mediatour, and the Vmpire, giv'n, To reconcile revolted Earth to Heav'n. Who, to impart to Vs His Immortality, Took part with Vs in this our fraile Mortality; And, in all things (except all Sinne alone) A perfect Man, put all our Nature on. Borne in the World, to make Vs Born-anew: In poverty, Vs richly to endew: Humbling himselfe, that we might raised be: In Servant's Form, to make vs ever Free; Came down to Earth, Vs vp to Heav'n to mount: Was tempted heer; our Tempter to surmount; Dy'd to destroy the Strength of Death and Sin: And Rose againe, our Righteousness to win. How oft did He, visite the Poore and Sick! Cure the Distracted, and Paralitique; Restore the Blinde, Deaf, Dumb, and Dead reviue; And Satans Captiues from his rage repriue! How many Idiots did He make excell The Wisest Masters in all Israel! How many rude, plain, silly Fisher-men, Rare power-full Preachers; Fishers (then) of Men. How-many Sin-sick did hee inly cure; And deep Soule-wounded binde-vp, and assure! How-many Proud, Loose, Cruell, Couetous, Made Hee Meek, Modest, Gentle, Bountious. By Him, deer Father, come we Thee to know, Thy Word, thy Will; to frame our owne Wils so: By Him alone, Wisedom we seek and finde; In Cares and Crosses, to confirm our minde. By Him alone, Thy sacred Truth we learn From suttlest Errors cleerly to discern: By Him all Clowds of darkness are dispell'd; Idolatrie and Heresie refell'd. By Him, We pray to Thee; and what we craue In lively Faith, we are assur'd to haue: Heav'ns Kingdom first, Soules Feast, and Bodies Food, Grace, Comfort, Peace, and every needfull Good. By Him, be We Thy Children of Adoption, Coheirs of Heav'n, and Vessels of Election: Becomming Man, He is become our Brother; So, happy We haue also Thee our Father. By Him, of Thee, Thine Holy Spirit we haue; Which in our hearts thy Law doth lively graue: The Comforter, the Spirit of Truth, of Loue, Of Power, of Peace, of Wisedom from aboue: The Spirit, which stayes vs, when in Storms we ride; And steers vs steddy, in our Calmer Tide: Which kils the Flesh, and chils infatuate Fires; To quicken Soules, and kindle Heav'ns-Desires: Which brings the Strays home to Thy holy Fold, Giues Stutters Tongues, and makes the bashfull bold; Opens the Sense of Sacred Mysteries; Giues Form, or Life to every thing that is. In Him, Thou built'st Thy Heav'n of Heav'ns excelling, Thy Court prepar'd for Saints eternall Dwelling: In Him, Thou mad'st the World and All to moue In every Part, as doth it best behoue. Hee, to the fainting heart new heart procures, Confirmes the feeble, fearfull Soules assures; Giues Faith, and Hope, Loue, Grace and godly Zeal. Happy those Soules where He delights to dwell. For, Those He fils with his aboundant Treasures, In diuers manners, and in diuers measures; As diuersly befits thy Churches state, To Plant, or Prune, or Prop, or Propagate. To som he gives a cleer, quick apprehension; To som, deep Iudgement; som, Divine Invention: To som, the door of gracefull Eloquence; To som, the store of Wisedoms Excellence: Som, to interpret with Divine dexterity The sacred Secrets of th'eternall Verity: Som (School-less Scholars; Learned, study-less) To vnderstand and speak all Languages: Som (to confirm their Office, and Thine Oracles) To work strange Wonders, great and many Miracles; Reviue the dead, recouer native Euils, Cure all Diseases; and even cast out Diuels. Such are th'Effects, Works, Vertues, Gifts and Graces, Which, by degrees, in divers times and places, Thy Holy Spirit to silly men hath giv'n; From Them, to Thee, to raise our hearts to Heav'n. And, as in our fraile Bodies (through varietie Of Members, fitted into One Societie) One very Soule doth actions different, Som more, Som less, Noble, or Excellent: So, in the mystick Bodie of Thy Son (Where many Members Loue vnites in One) Thine Owne, One Spirit, works actions admirable, Among themselues more or less honourable. Yet, orderly, Each his owne Rank observes; And properly, Each his owne Office serves: Nor boasteth any, other not to need: For oft the least, the most of all doth steed. Therefore the stronger must the weak support: The safe and sound, cheer the afflicted sort: The Rich and mighty, not despise Inferiours; Neither the mean enuy or hate Superiours. Were All a Head, in This faire Frame of Man; Where were the Foot, the Hand, the Stomack than? Were All a Tongue, where should the Eye become? Were All an Eye, where should the Eare haue room. O Spirit Eternall! which hast All compos'd; In Number, Measure, Order, All dispos'd; Make Charity Vs (mutuall Members) moue; Vnite our Spirits in thy perpetuall Loue. Quench all Contentions, Errors, Heresies, Which, both our Mindes and Bodies tyrannize: Quench all Concupiscence, and foule Desire, Which, both our Bodies and Soules Death conspire. Vouchsafe our Soules, Rest; without Schismik strife; Our Bodies Health, through chaste and sober Life. What could we ask? what should we rather craue, Then in sound Bodies as sound Soules to haue? Sound is the Bodie kept, by keeping Chaste, With moderate Exercise, and mean repast: Sound is the Soule, which resteth (sober-wise) Content in Thee; vn-vext in Vanities. Sound is the Soule, free from all Self-Sedition Of Pride, Hate, Envy, Auarice, Ambition, And all the Crowd of Mans Concupiscence; Binding His Will to Thy Obedience. Who is so bound (Thy Servant) is most Free: Most Rich, who leaues all Riches else, for Thee: Most easie rests, who most for Thee endures: Most Self-distrusting, most Thy Strength assures. So Thee to Serue, is euen to Raign: in brief, So to Obey, is to Command in Chief. To walke Thy Wayes, is only Libertie. To learne Thy Learning, ENCYCLOPÆDIE. O! happy Those that stand in such a state; And in Thy Statutes alwaies meditate: Or, if they slip, or trip, or faile, or fall, Return betimes, and for Thy Mercy call. For, though thy Law, in Firie Thunder-giv'n, Threat still the Stubborn, with Revenge from Heav'n; Thy gracious Gospell offers Pardon free, To humbled Soules that Sigh, in Faith, to Thee. And Thou, who wilt not, Sinners die, but liue; Hast promis'd, All, so suing, to forgiue. Thy Word is Truth: Thy Promise to fulfill, Thou (God of Truth) hast euer Power and Will. O! Bountious Thou, which doost so oft repaire Our broken Soules, and keep'st them from Despaire: And, blessed Wee, whose Faith in Love's Physicion. Assures our Hope, of all our Sins Remission. Who-so hath Sorrow for his Sinfulness, Purpose to mend, Desire of Holiness, Trust in Thy Mercy; hath no need to doubt But, by Thy Grace, his Sins are wyped out. O Cordiall Word! O Comfortable breath! Reviving Soules, even in the Gates of Death! From Iawes of Hell, raising our Hopes to Heav'n! Therefore, deer Lord, To Thee all Praise be giv'n. Who shall accuse vs now, if Thou acquight? God being with vs, what can vs affright? Our Faith in Thee (O!) What can shake, or shock; So surely fixt vpon so firme a Rock? What shall divide vs, Lord, from Loue of Thee? Shall Shame? shall Sorrow? shall Adversity? Shall Famine? Plague? War? Wealth, or Want? (In sum) Shall Life? shall Death? things Present, or to Come? Stay, stay vs, Lord, and steel our feeble harts, Against the sting of temporary Smarts: Draw, draw our Soules neer to thy Self, O Lord, With powerfull Touches of Thy Spirit and Word. Guide, guide our Steps still in thy Gracious Way, During our Durance in This house of Clay; That when This Prison shall be broken down, We may with Thee receiue a Glorious Crown. So shall We ever, with a voyce Divine, Sing Halleluiahs to th'ETERNAL TRINE; Record thy Mercies, which all Thoughts surmount; And Thus the Glory of Thy Deeds recount: Svpernall Lord, Eternall King of Kings, Maker, Maintainer, Mouer of All things, How infinite! How excellently-rare! How absolute! Thy Works, Thy Wonders are! How-much Their Knowledge is to be desir'd! How, THOV, in All, to be of All admir'd! FINIS. Micro-cosmo-graphia: THE LITTLE-WORLDES DESCRIPTION; OR THE MAP OF MAN (From Latin Saphiks of that Famous, late, Preacher in London, M?. Henry Smith.) Translated; &amp; Dedicated To the Right Honourable, Honoria, Lady Hay. By Iosvah Sylvester. TO THE Right-RIGHT HONORABLE Honoria, Wife of Iames, Lord Hay, Sole Daughter and Heire of Edvvard Lord Denny. Equally bound, in humble Gratitude, To Two deer Equals (to You equall Deer); Vnable (yet) with Both at once to cleer, Vwilling yet, with Either to be rude: Faine would I craue to haue my Bond renewd, For a more Happy, or more Hopefull Year, When gratious Heav'n shall daign to set me freer From old cold Cares, which keep my Muse vnmew'd. Would You be pleas'd (Madame) to interpose Your gentle breath, I would not doubt to speed: Such vertue hath Your Vertue still with Those. Therefore in Hope of Your kinde Help (at need) This simple Pledge I Offer at Your Feet; Altar of Loue, Where both Their Vowes do meet. Your Honorable Vertue's humble Votarie, Iosvah Sylvester. THE MAP OF MAN. I sing not, but (in Sighes abrupt) Sob-out the State of Man, corrupt By th'olde Serpent's banefull Breath; Whose strong Contagion still extends To euery Creature that descends From th'old Little World of Death. Drad-deer Creator, new-create Thy Creature: Saviour expiate This, and all our Owne Addition: O Sacred Spirit, Our Spirits renew; Informe, reforme, and tune Me trew, To condole Our sad Condition. In Earth, Man wanders (Pilgrim-wise) Hopes, doubts, desires, faints, freezes, fryes; Crossed, tossed to and fro: Hee turnes, he windes; he findes no good: He ay complaines that Evill's Flood (Farre and wide) doth over-flowe. His Birth (in Sinne) beginnes in Tears: His Life is rife in Paines and Fears; Will-Hee, nill-Hee, spoyling sport: His Death with groans, in doubtfull case, Sends him, God knowes, vnto what place: Blest none rest, but in the Port. The Flesh against the Spirit rebells: The Spirit againe the Flesh repells; Ever striving, never still: And sodenly, while these contend, Their common Foe, the cursed Fiend, Findes advantage Both to kill. Earth (Step dam-like) sharp Rods doth yield, To scourge her Sonnes: the Sea is fild (Both aboue and vnder too) With hideous Horrors, past report: Th'Aier whirling in Tempestuous sort, Beats, and threats All to vndoo. The Countrey's rude, and foe to Fame; The Court more braue, and more to blame; Painted Faces, graces fain'd: The Citie (There, O! bad's the best) Seat of Deceit, and Misers nest; Gold their God, vngodly gain'd. Iarre at the Barre: Stews at the Stage; In Way-fare, Theeues: in War-fare, Rage: Noyse abroad: Annoyes at home: In Churches, Purchase, Profanation, Fiends seeming Saints; Abhomination: Euery-where, no Feare of Doome. The Throne's not given vnto the Iust: The Faithfull is not put in Trust: Prophets are not held for true: Nor loyall lov'd, nor learned grac't, Nor weary eas'd, nor Worthy plac't: Nor hath any heer his dew. The impudent, the insolent, The Foole, the Friend in complement, And the sly, we see (by proofe) Held eloquent, magnanimous, Right pleasant, kinde, ingenious; And the Wealthy, wise enough. Reward is heard: words are but winde: Each Art is long; Life short confin'd: Might makes Right in every Cause. Physicke is vile, and vilely vs'd; Diuinity, disdain'd, abus'd: Vnder-foot, men tread the Lawes. The Rich with rage, the Poore with plaints, With hate the Wise, with scorne the Saints, Evermore are curstly crost: With painfull toyle the Private-man, The Nobler states with Enuy wan, Without end are torne and tost. If good, hee fares no better for't; If bad, no worse they him support; Fortune serueth all alike: Though she simper, though she smile, Though she laugh outright awhile, She is alwayes slippery-sleeke. Who lately serued, Lords-it now: Who lately becked, now doth bow: Valleyes swell, and Mountaines sink: Who lately flourisht, now doth fade: Who late was strong, now feeble made, Feeding Worms, in Dust doth stink. So, Lowely rests: so, Lofty rues. Say that one might his fortune chuse, Vnder Heav'n to haue his will; 'T would be a Doubt, among the Wise, Whether it better were to Rise To High state, or to Sit still. Phant'sie conceiues, Reason receiues, Passion repugns (and Patience reaues). What I wish, What I desire, I see: and Sense importunes so, I couet, I commend it too: Then againe it doth retire. Sense, whither now? Tis griefe to see What flits so fast, so suddenly. Reason, whither roams thy reach? What hurts, were better still be hid, And still vnknowne; O! ill-bestid! Poor in store, in Wealth a wretch. When Fortune comes, she means our Wrack; And when she goes, she breaks our back: Comming, going, all is one. For, What she gives she takes away, Vnkinde and blinde, inconstant ay; Frank to few, and firme to none. Oft haue I canvas'd, whethers Case Is Worst; the Fall'n, or th'ever-Base: Yet, scarce can I it decide. The Fall proues plainly for the first: Want Pleads, that ever-Want is Worst; Partial! to their proper side. It irks the Fall'n to haue been High; Th'ay-Poor could wish he had been By: Either others state would glad. If euen in gladness sadnesse growe, Were not I somewhat glad also, How extreame should I be sad! If Care We take, it health impaires: If not, it takes vs vn-awares: Whether should we seek or shun? Whether (to passe vnto the next) The good or bad be most perplext, Is another Question. The Guilty suffers for his Fault: The Guilt-less doubts no less assault By Mis-fortune: both desire To liue on Earth, to draw this breath: Both feare to Die; and, after Death, Torment of eternall Fire. Hence, slowe Dayes labour wears vs thin: Hence, lightly, Nightly fears begin: Hence, rathe Rising and late Rest: Hence, toughest storms, and roughest streams: Hence, griping Cares, and ghastly Dreams, Waking, sleeping, doo molest. Winter's too-colde: Summer's too-hot; Autumne too-moyst (which breeds the Rot) All the hope is in the Spring. The liuely Spring is louely faire: But if keen Ice then chill the Aier, Little pleasure dith it bring. Seas drowne the Vales: the Windes do heaue The Hils to Heav'n; the Rocks they cleaue. Bolde Ambition stands amaz'd, Expecting where to build a Fort So strong, and rampyr'd in such sort, That it never may be raz'd. Peace is too-droun'd in Lust and Sloath: Warre is too-drunk with Blood and Wrath: That, too-gawdie; this, too-grim. Mens mindes are all so delicate, So soft, and so effeminate, Small things, all things, grieuous seem. Either the Head doth alwaies ake, Or Palat slip, or Palsey shake, Or our Belly roars within: Or else with Choler we abound, Or else with Phlegm, or else (vnsound) Tumour's humours, scald our skin. What dread of Death, What greedy Lust, What Surfait, Sloath, and Deeds vniust, Daily plunge in Perills rife; What Sword consumeth every houre, And what the Plague doth quick deuour, Lengthens Physick, shortens Life. Where's now Æneas? Where's his Son: Where's Hercules? Where's Salomon? Where is Dauid? Where is Saul? Where's Cyrus, Cæsar, and the rest? Ah! He and They are all deceast: I must follow: so must all. Hark: Thou, whom most the People hailes; The wisest errs: the iustest failes: Strongest limpeth now and than: The humblest swells: the sobrest sips: The holiest sins: the wariest slips: God is fault-less: neuer, Man. Too-curious or too-carelesly, Too-lavish or too-slavishly, By the Foole or by the Knaue; Too-craking or too-cravenly, Too-hatefull, or too-gratefully: Haste or waste marrs all we haue. Ambition's end is Rule and Raigne: Crueltie's, Conquest: Guile's, is Gaine, To growe Rich by hook or crook: Iuggling, and struggling, strife in all: No Triumph without Fight will fall; War-less, none for Peace may look. We think, but never can intend, Good thoughts well to begin; or end If perhaps they be begun: Or, if we end them, never finde (How-ever rare, in any kinde) Recompence when we haue done. Our heart it hath an in-borne Guest, Will-ill (it hight): it posteth prest To the Tongue, ill Words to vent: Desire, then, rushes to ill Deeds: Vengeance anon the Fact succeeds. Thus comes Ill to Punishment. If safe, this Snake we choak or charm; Within, againe We hug it Warm, Daring, doubting, vp and down; Till Lust, as lighter, vp doth surge; And th'horror of the fearfull Scourge, Fall, as heavier, to the ground. Come flesh, be frolike, take delight, Let's revell now: 't will once be night: Shall a little Gout, or Colick, Or sudden Qualm, or sullen Care, Or addle Fit of idle Feare Mar thy Mirth? Come Flesh, be frolick. What seeks, we shun; What shuns, we seek: What helps, we loath; What hurts, we like: Bird in-hand we leaue, for bush. For, What we Want we panting craue; And loosely lavish what We haue; Brag, of that should make vs blush. With-childe with mirth, we bring-forth Scorn, We bring-vp Furie; over-born (Moov'd and mooving) either way; Too-sorry, or too-merry-mad: The happy Meane is never had, While we Wretches heer doo stay. We reigne and serve: we want and flowe: We ioy and mourne: wee freez and glowe: Vowes we make and break (together): We build and batter; ioyne and iarre: We heap and scatter; make and marre: And we flourish, and we wither. We look to Heaven, and leap to Hell: Our Hope and Fear (by turnes) rebell; Plunging down, or puffing-vp: Please would we faine, but finde demurre; Please might we well, did Will concurre: Sloath doth stay, and Lust doth stop. So, still we stand, and whine the while; Nought Labour boots, nor Ioue, nor wile: All is lost, when 'tis too-late. Euills to th'euill and the good Are daily sent: and if with-stood, We but faster foster Fate. I will at once give-ouer quight Both to be Wicked and Vpright; To doe either Right, or Wrong: For, Goods well-gotten, growe but thin, Get hardly vp, come slowely in: And th'ill-gotten last not long. What shall I doe? If I forbear My Cause-less Foe, I blush, I fear His Despight, and my Disparage. If, to revenge me, I resolue; It satisfies, when I revolue None's all-Fault-less, in all Cariage. When I haue spar'd, I wish t'haue spoke: And when I speak, I would revoke; Better pleas'd t'haue held my peace: Would God I could (as Wiser-ones) Both speake and holde my peace at once; So to liue at Quietness. Deare Minde, how doost Thou? Frayle and sick, My Flesh implores thy Succour quick: Canst? O! canst Thou cure her griefe? O! daign (I pre-thee) then with speed To helpe thy Servant now at need; Send her Reason for reliefe. For, Faithfull Minde's firm Resolution Cures often-times th'ill Constitution Of a Bodie sick-inclin'd: But, then the Bodie (late deplored For weake estate) to Health restored, Growes a Burthen to the Minde. O Sin-bred Hurt! O in-bred Hell! Nor full, nor fasting, never well; Never found? What shall I say? Once all was well, and would be now Better then ever, if that Thou Cursed Sin wert quight away. But now (alas!) all Mischiefe lies In Ambush with all Miseries, Mans Confusion to conspire: Desire and Feare at-once torment: Feare is a Tyrant; Mal-content, And insatiate is Desire. Who fears? who mourns? who wants? who wanders? Ah! only Men (Wils ill-Commanders). Man alone abounds therein. Lowd Lamentations, Lasting Terrors, Hart-wounding Wants, and wilfull Errors, Had not been, had Man not been. Heer Pestilence, there Hungers Iawe, Heer Drink, there Duel, there the Lawe, Snatches one or other hence. Heer Crosse, there Care: or (better blest) Who hap These Haps to scape the best, Age devours with-out Dispense. Perpending This in minde perplext, The Miserable (Envie-vext) Cryes, O Beasts, O Foules, O Fish! You happy, harm-less, storm-less things, Precise in Natures Lessonings, Liue You long: You Life may wish. But, I think, better not be born; Or, born, hence quickly to return To our Mothers dusty Lap; Then living, daily heer to die, In Cares, and Feares, and Miserie, By Miss-heed, or by Miss-hap. While Hunger gripes mee gut and gall, While burning Thirst for Drink doth call, While for Cold I quake: alas! In languor long I linger-on. O! happy Those, whose Woes, whose Mone, Ridding quick doth quickly passe. The Stout, the Coward, and the Meek, All skirmish vnder Fortune like, Stryking all with Mischiefs aye; The Stout repugns, the Patient prayes, The Hare-like Coward runnes his wayes; Fortune differs not, but They. Too-peeuish This, too-pleasant That, (Too-fierce, or too-effeminate) Golden Mean can hardly stand Betwixt these Two Extreams, vpright; 'Tis worne so weak, and waigh'd so light: Error playes on either hand. Wedlock, with Wife and Children cloggs: The Single-Life, Lusts heavier Loggs (Rare's the Gift of Continence). The Young-man stalks, the Old-man stoops, That over-dares, This ever droops: Th'Infant craules through Impotence. Masters taxe Servants, proud, slut, slowe; Servants, Churle Master, Mistress Shrowe: Either Others Fault can finde. The Daughter thinks her Mother froward; Mother her Daughter deems vn-toward: Kit (they say) will after Kinde. Princes doe enuy Subiects Wealth: Subiects doe enuy Princes Health: Each doth enuy Others Good: All, all doe enuy Learnings Honour (If any be conferd vpon her) O! ô wicked, wretched Mood! The Souldier likes the Rusticks Calm; The Clowne affects the Souldiers Palme: Thus doth Enuy inly fret-her: Our Pastures parch, our Heards be poore; Our Neighbour thriues in every store: Others Crop is ever better. Fond Lovers languish at their Eyes: The Wrathfull fosters and defies Frenzies, Furies, (wayward Elues): What need we call for Whip or Scourge? Their punishment what need we vrge? Their Selfs Errors scourge themselues. Feare hunts the Coward at the heel; The Cruell, still Revenging steel; Ruine Him that Ruine seeks; Heauy Revenge on haynous Crimes: Yea, in the Sin, the Plague some-times; Heavens iust hand so iustly strikes. Sorrow and Shame, for what is past; Care, of the present; Feare (fore-cast) Of the danger yet to-come; Make all false Pleasures shorter seem, And sharper too in pain extreame, Then euen Paine it selfe to some. If I be merry, I am mad (Say the Severe): if Sober-sad, Merry Greeks me Meacok call. Is't possible for any-Man, At-once to please (doe what hee can) God, Himselfe, the World, and all? Who Greatnesse hautily affects, Who Great Things happily effects; That is hated, This enuy'd: But, hoping Greatnesse, who so haps To faile (or fall in After-Claps) Him the Vulgar dare deride. Vertve is vanquisht by her Foes, Whose Triumph euen their Fore-head showes, 'Tis a shame to be ashamed But shall I tell (and tell thee trew) Thy Fate (the Fruit that shall ensew Shame-less shamefull life vntamed)? This Fate then falls to be Thine owne, Such shalt thou reap as thou hast sowne: Wages like thy Work expect. Who heer their Dayes in Euill spend, Shall suffer Euills, with-out End; Such is Minos Doom direct. Then, swagger, stagger, spend and spoile; Steale and conceale, and keep a coile; Quickly shalt thou all forgoe: Kill, conquer, triumph; down againe Shalt thou bee cast: bouz, beat, disdaigne; Th'End's at hand, and comes not slowe. The Wise bewaile Mens Follies rife, And faine would cure their Vitious life With Receits of heavenly Skill: But Sin-sick Fooles (what-ever prick, Benumbd by Custome) lethargike, Care not, feare not, feele no ill. Who knoweth much, much ill he knowes: Who little reaks, much good forgoes. Hence, perplexed Doubts hee casts; What is great Knowledge? What so much Of Learning? or of Book-skill such? But great Blazes, and light Blasts? While Plato, sportiue, doth despise, The sullen Cyniks Sloven-guise; Hee, as fast (on th'other side) Doth Plato's Pomp as much condemn And trample-on: Were both of them (Who can tell me?) VVise, or VVide? Democritus heer laughes a-good: Heraclitus there weeps a Flood. Glad and sad would mend vs faine: But now, so stubborn-stiffe is Man, That Teares, nor Tunes, nor Ought else can Faults restore, nor Fates restraine. Sloath never wanteth Want, for Mate; Thrift, Sweat and Labour macerate; Either in their issue languish: So, Health is never without Sin, Nor Sickness without Paine with-in: Outward Ache, or inward Anguish. Service is to the Lofty minde A Curb, a Spur to th'abiect Hinde; Seld or never stoops the Will: The Vulgar voyce, the Common Cry Is, Welcome, Welcome LIBERTY; Good for good, but ill for ill. A Griefe it is alone to bee; But more, to haue ill companie: More or lesse (alas!) by This, Appeareth plaine, when all is donne, (As Proofe hath found) that vnder Sunne, Heer's no full, no perfect Blisse. Who never yet himselfe could please, What can content? What vse? What Ease? What availeth Wealth at will? Needy and naked heer I liue: To die, it doth me nothing grieue; But to perish, and liue still. I looke to Heaven, and there (alas!) With Feare I see my Iudges Face, Auditing my Summes of Sin: I think of Hell, and then I burne Like Ætna: then to Earth returne, Cares and Feares there never lin. This feele I, thus I iustly fare: O Man! learne quickly, and have care Sacred Duties to obserue. This Life is rife in Troubles sore: But yet (alas!) a Million more Our Rebellion doth deserue. Much like, or worse then former Age, The futures Face we may presage: Better seldome comes, they say. Now Right, now Wrong; now Good, now Ill; Now Fiend, now Friend; now God, now Will, Seem to haue alternate Sway. Nothing is gratis given nor got: Each labours more or lesse (God wot) With the hand or with the head: None without Art or Vertue thriue; Nor Art, nor Vertue all atchieue: Onely, these, not alwaies sped. What should I seek or sue for much, To liue at Rest? Content is Rich. Fortune often is too-free, And often kils where shee's too-kinde: But, had we once an equall Minde, Wee should all contented bee. But every one is too-secure In sunny Dayes; and in obscure, Too-deiected in Desire: Hence, ouer-faint, or ouer-full; Too-pyned, or too-plentifull, Fry we all with inward Fire. Now, Dust her dustie Brood expects: Come, Earth to Earth (of either Sex). Pleasure trembles at her Call; Cryes-out of Haste, complaines of Heaven: But Paine and Sorrow (narrow-driven) Are well pleas'd, and eas'd withall. Who gives me grace to gush-out Teares, And lends me space to poure forth Prayers; Yet, both seeming to neglect? 'Tis God the dreadfull, Sinners Scourge; The gracious God, which oft doth purge Ills with Pils, in his Elect. Behold me, Thou that didst bestow Thy Son on Mee; Forgiue me, Thou That didst suffer for my Sin: Assist and stay me evermore Thou, Thou that heer so oft before, In my brest a Guest hast bin. Regarde vs, Lord, vnworthy though; Thy Glory seek, thy Mercy showe; Enemies approach apace: We faile, we fall, we cannot stand, Our Foes will haue the vpper hand But Thou helpe vs with thy Grace. Witness my Selfe that heer lie slain, But by Thy Touch reviv'd again; Glad to liue, to liue to Thee: And yet desire to be dissolv'd (When my due Date shall be revolv'd) As more happy farre for Mee. Shew me the Holy Land, which flowes With Milke and Hony (Saints Repose). Traine mee in the new Commerce, In the New Art of Better Life: Then fare-well Muses, fare-well Strife: In Thy Courts I will converse. I cannot strike Appollo's string, Study for Heav'n and timely ring Sacred Aaron's golden Bell; Nor sing at-once the Thespian Songs, And serue my Countrey, as belongs: Therefare, Mvses heer Fare-well.

Chaste Muse of Muses, that in sacred Layes, With straines vnwonted, dost delight to raise From blacke Obliuion's sad and silent Tents, Th'Heroick Gests and Noble Monuments Of antike WORTHIES, and their fames reuiue Through euery Age to All that shall suruiue; Now, Now reuolue th'Authenticall Records Of th'Holy Nation, whom the Lord of Lords Chose for his Owne, (Whose Line directly came From Princely Loines of faithful ABRAHAM): And sweetly tun'd to th'sacred voyce of Truth, Sing That Religious, That rare-Modest Youth (Good Isaac's Grand-child, and great Iacob's Son) Whom God indu'd, by Dreames) of things yer done To tell the issue: Tell, O! tell Thou All That He indar'd through swelling Euuies Gall; Till at the last, tryumphing of his Foes, Through Pharao's grace to Princely Place he rose (As Egypt's Viceroy) by diuine Decree Fore-sent, a Friend and Founder there to be Of th'happy People and the holy Seed, From Whence, should Hope of future Life proceed; And whence Saluation should be freely giuen, Through th'heauenly Key that should re-open Heauen. And O! Thou Glory of Great STVARTS stemme, Great Iacobs Heire, Great-Brittaines Ioy and Gemme, CHARLES King of Hopes, and Hope-ful Prince of Men, My great Mecœnas, to encheere my Pen, Assist Thou also: and with gentle Gales Of Helpe-full Fauour fill my Hopefull Sailes: That maugre Enuie's Rocke and Fortunes Storme, My sacred Voyage I may safe performe, To th'only glory of my Ghostly Guide, His Churches Profit, and Your Praise, beside; While vnder IOSEPH's Wondrous Temperance, His Pietie, His Prudent Gouernance, I prophecie Your Princely Vertues Crop (Your Parents Prayer, and Your Peoples Hope) God say Amen. But, Tide for none doth stay: I must aboord, I must mine Anchor waigh. Away to Sea: the Winde is wondrous good: Spread all our Canuas: O how swift we scud! Through all the Western, and the Mid-land Seas, Arriu'd already to descry (with ease) The Coast of Ioppa and Samarian Hills, With wealthy Sichems goodly Groues and Fields. Already (running twixt his winding banks) Iordan begins to wash our wel-come Planks, Where Hebron's valley our glad Welcome sings, And euen Mount Tabor with the Eccho rings. Th'Old Serpent knew (for, Much to know is giuen Vnto that Hell-god, by the God of Heauen) It was decreed by euerlasting Date, And promised, that there should propagate, From Abraham's happy Stocke, a holy Stem Which should confound th'Infernall Diadem. In doubt whereof, perplext and vexed sore, His Ielousie of Iacob grew the more. The more he enuies Sichem's Shepheard-Prince; As well because, with duer Reuerence Did None obserue and serue th'Eternall Lord, Nor iuster liu'd, nor righter him ador'd; As for the goodly Blessings of his Bed, (Twelue lusty Sonnes) likely alone to spread Into a People holy and deuout. Therefore he labours, and he layes-about, With all the Engines of his hellish Hate, That, That deere Issue to exterminate. Especially, that louely Lad (whose Birth Had happy Stars, presaging holy Worth;) Ioseph, the darling of his Fathers age, Borne of his (first-lou'd) second marriage: Whom, Nature-grac't, the Graces nurtur'd fine In liberall Arts, and loue of Law diuine; Inspir'd his Soule with skill of future things; His minde aspiring with celestiall wings: To Elders Modest, to his equalls milde, With Piety and Prudence past a Childe. Now, as from flowres whence Bees their hony make, The loathsome Spider doth his poyson take; Hence did the Fiend in th'other Brethren hatch Close deadly Hate, him harm-lesse to dispatch: Nor would He let the first occasion slip That might aduance his wily workemanship: For, for the most, to each mans Inclination, He knowes in time, to offer his Temptation. It hapned then, vpon a Summers day, When as the Sunne had with his parching Ray Driuen all the Brethren all their flocks to driue To the coole Couert that the Woods would giue; Them-selues set round vnder a shadie Oake, Yong Ioseph thus gently the rest bespoke. Brothers, I'le tel you my strange Dream to night: Heare it, I pray (what euer meane it might, It was an odde one.) Early, when the Stars Were all call'd in (excepting Lucifer's, Dayes daily vsher) slumbring sweet this morne, Me thought VVe all were in a field of Corne, All binding Sheaues; and when we each had One, My Sheafe, me thought, stood bolt vpright alone, And all your Sheaues did instantly incline, And lowely bow their bended tops to mine. Then Iudah, nettled with no little hate Against the Lad, began him thus to rate: VVhy, saucy Boy, VVhat phant'sies dost thou fable? Is this your Dreame, you deeme so admirable? Hath not perhaps some Spirit inspir'd you so? No doubt there hath: the spirit of VVine, I trowe. But, pray, VVhat Augure doth your wonder bring? That you (belike) shall of vs all be King. Good King of Crickets, line thy Crown with Baies, Lest drunken Vapors some Rebellion raise. The rest concurr'd to gird the harmlesse Boy With slouts and shouts of O God giue you ioy: God saue your Grace, Your maiesty to come; And tell, in Scorne, their Father all the summe. Hee, good old man, (not without God within) He ponders all that he had heard and seene; As if discerning somewhat in the Lad Of higher straine, than euery stripling had: Yet, to conceale it from the rest he seemes, And bids the Boy beware of guilefull Dreames. But, He, to whom God greater Honors meant, Sonne after dream'd of grauer Argument. Him seem'd, that, set in stately Eminence, Before his Feet, with humble Reuerence, The Sunne and Moone and Eleuen Stars he saw, Stooping vnto him in obsequious Awe. VVhich well recording (for by heauenly grace That Gift he had) within a little space He tells his Brethren of his second Transe: Who, re-incenst with ragefull Arrogance, Soone shew their Father, with his fatall Dreame, Their rancor, spleene, and cank'red spite extreame. Iacob, at first amazed, calls his Sonne; And, as interp'ring, thus to chide begun: What! Sirra, shall I, and your Mother too, And all your Brothers bow our Necks to you? Shall you be mounted on your Chaire of State, And Wee come All base Beggars to your Gate? If such a folly haue befum'd your brain, And fill'd your phant'sie with presumption vaine, With idle Hopes: away with those Conceits; Trust not to Dreams, list not to such Deceits So reason-lesse, ridiculous, and light; Monsters, Chimæra's, shadowes of the Night: Which (if not good) it is not God doth send, But some Illusion of the subtle Fiend, To traine our Weakeness to some sinfull Trap; Or to betray vs to some dire mis-hap: As from his Cels false Oracles hee wrests, From flight of Birds, and Tripes of mangled Beasts. Hast thou not heard of Belus, Anubis, Ops, Hecate and other Deities, Whom the blinde Heathen in their Temples haue, Frequent their Altars, and their Rites obserue; Waiting their Answers with the humblest Awe, All which is hatefull to our Holy-Law? Therefore be Wise: and looke henceforth we heare No more such Dreames of such phantastike geare. He, thus dismist, the rest he milde bespake To calme their storme, and kindly bade them take The Flocks to Field, and driue them soft and faire To Sichem Woods, to feede in cooler aire. Their Fathers bidding they eft-soones obay'd (Yong Ioseph yet at home with him he staid) Passing the fruitfull Vales and flow'ry Greenes Of plentious Hebron, to those shadie Screenes. But, nor the Verdure of those Hills nor Dales, Nor song of Birds, nor shade of Woods, nor Gales Of whispering Winds, could kill or cancell quite Those odious Dreames they dream-on day &amp; night: Rather, they gather daily more Disdaine, Sharpen their Enuy, giue their Rage the raine, With Threats &amp; Vows; while the euil spirit, too nigh, Still stirres and spurres their hatefull Ielousie. Now, twice the Sunne had run his Iourny swift, When the next morning they prepare to shift To Dothan's pleasant Downs for fresher Feed, And to be further off from home (indeed); And so the longer ere they could reuert; Which they euen loath'd, and hated at the heart. Wherefore (night after night, day after day) When, past their wont, their Father saw them stay; In musefull care his Ioseph cals he quicke, And bids him Thus; I pree-thee Boy goe seeke Thy Brethren out (on Sichem Downes they feed, Or neere about) and bring me word with speed, VVhat vncouth Reason of their stay there is: My minde mis-giues me somewhat is amisse With them, or with their Cattle: hye thee, Lad. Away scuds Ioseph (no lesse swift then glad) As far as Sichem: but there looking round, Neither his Brethren, nor the Flocks he found. Perplexed then, he calls them one by one; Hoaw, Brothers! Ruben! Leui! Simeon! Then, whoops and hallooes with a Treble throat, So loud and shrill, that, to his warbling Note With doubled Ecchoes, Woods and Caues reply: But, not a Brother answers Eare or Eye. By chance, a Wood-man that an Oke did shrowd, Hearing the Lad, and knowing, call'd him lowd, And told him thus; I heard your Brethren say They would to Dothan: Thither, that's the way, There shall you finde them with their Cattle safe, In better Pasture then is heere by halfe. Thanks thinks the Lad: and Sichem out of sight, As swift as Roehe runs to Dothan right. When, from a Hill, his Hatefull Brethren spi'd Him yet farre-off: O! yonder comes (they cry'd) Our King to-come, whom both the Sun and Moone, And all the Stars must serue and worship soone. We, We base Hindes, borne but for Heards &amp; Neat, Drudging all Day in the Suns scorching heat, Lodging all Night in holes or hollow Trees, Clad but in Lether, or in coursest Freeze, And meanly fed with Bread and Water, most; While He is set-vp with his Sod and Roast, His Messe of Goats-Milke, and his fill of Wine, In change of Coates, pranked and painted fine; Snoring all night vpon his ease-full bed, Where, from the Forge of his phantastike head, He feignes these Dreames in meer disdain of vs: But, Brethren, shall we, shall we suffer thus Him and his Scorning? Shall we be so blinde T'indure him still, till growne a Man, his minde Growne big withall, and bearing proud vpon His Fathers fondnesse, He supplant anon Our Haps and Hopes, vsurping All our due, And so (in fine) ful-fill his Dreames too-true? O! We are Buzzards, Blockheads, Cowards all. Why rather heere, where none descry vs shall, Where all things sort, where he is come so pat, Shall we not kill him, and make sure for that? For, in this Pit we may him deepe interre, And say (at home) some hungry Wolfe or Beare (VVhereof the Desarts, not far off, haue store) Him quicke deuoured, and to peeces tore. While these dire Counsels they together cast, Ruben (who all, in yeeres and pitty, past) Cry'd, God defend, O Brethren, God defend, Against our Brother we should so offend: O! in his bloud doe not your hands imbrue, Lest Heau'ns drad Vengeance that dire fact pursue On Vs and Ours. Though no man witnesse be, God, God himselfe is witnesse, and doth see And here vs all: from him is nothing hid; Hee's all an Eye that neuer closeth Lid. But, if you needs will of the Lad be quit, Sanz bloud or slaughter, put him in this pit, There leaue him to his Fate. This he aduis'd; That, rescu'd thus from present death deuis'd, He, late at night returning to the Caue, Might hale him vp, and th'harmless stripling saue, To bring him safe vnto his aged Sire, And calme at length his Brethrens enuious Ire. Their Elders Words them All a little mou'd, And his aduice they all at once approu'd: Him downe vnslaine, into the pit to slide, His worse or better Fortune to abide. Then Ruben said; Be VVitnesse God for Me, How cleere I am from this your Cruelty: And as he spake, him from them far withdrew Into the Woods, to wait what would ensue. By this, was Ioseph (full of liuely cheere For hauing found them) euen arriued neere; When, fell and furious, they inclose him round, Lay hands on him, his tender hands they bound, With brauing Threats; Now shall you see (say they) Your Dreames fulfill'd: Must not we all obey Your Mightinesse? Our sheaues must stoop to you: Yea, to your State, Sunne, Moone, and Stars must bow. Wondring and frighted with their vncouth guise, In vain (alas!) in vain he calls and cries To them for pitty of his Innocence; While inly Rage, with more Impatience Still egg'd them on, with fell Erynnis brands: And hellish Pluto (who too-ready stands, Weening to crosse the Destinies Diuine) Doth all their Edge 'gainst him alone incline. When he perceiu'd (poor Boy!) no vows, no tears Could mollifie those stony hearts of Theirs To hold their hands, already heauing him With violence vnto the Dungeons brim; His Eyes lift vp towards th'Empyreall Pole, Thus, loud he groned from a greeued soule. Great God of Abraham, Isaac, Iacob, too, Who kennest all things, and canst all things doe; If I sincerely haue ador'd thee still: If I haue gladly done my Parents Will: If I haue liued pious and vpright; Lord looke vpon me in this wofull plight. Or, if it please Thee, that I heere expire; Yet spare, O Lord, O spare mine aged Sire. And, O! my Brethren (whom, with due respect Of Eldership, I euer did affect) How-euer Me you pitty not, I pray Pitty our Father (least vntimely gray His hoary head come to the graue for greefe) Let not him heare it: rather say some Theefe, Or knot of Theeues, Mee (by the way) bereft; That some false hope may of my life be left, To lengthen his: though heere (alas!) I lye Dead in these sands, and hid from any eye: And as he spake, his Teares so fast did fall, They stopt his speech, and almost staid withall His Brethrens rage; till Ruth-lesse Issachar Re-fand the fire. Nay, hauing gon thus farre, We may not now, We cannot, safe desist; For why? whereon I need not now insist; Your selues (said he) can quickly ghesse, I trowe, Mischiefs enow, if now we let him goe. Let vs therefore go on as wee decreed, Let's let him downe. Heereto they all agreed, With heart and hand, and did it instantly; And then Remorselesse, on the Grasse hard by Made no more bones, but sate them down to dinner. O! the dull Conscience of a hardned sinner! But, from th'Empyreall, through th'Æthereal Pole, God looking downe vpon the harmlesse Soule, In tender Pitty, and eternall Loue Towards his Owne, among the Troops (aboue) Of winged Heralds that are euer prest, Expecting gladly his Diuine Behest, Too ne he beckens, and he bids him Thus; Right Trusty, hy thee, hy thee down from vs, Toward Samaria, well thou knowest where, And whom thou know'st one day ordain'd to bear A glorious Part, in honorable Place, Good Isaac's Grand-Child, now in pitious case, Crying for succour from a darke deepe Cell, Against his Brethrens enuious Furie fell: Goe comfort him, poore heart; but in what kinde, I need not say. Thou seest, thou know'st my min'de. So, with his gratious All-directing. Nod, Th'Angel, dis-mist, in th'instant spreads abroad Æthereall wings on his Aëreall sides, And through the woundless Welkin swifter glides Then Zephyrus; or, then (when mounted high VVith many Turns, and towring in the Skye) The stout Ger-Faulcon sloopeth at the Herne, VVith sodaine Souse, that many scarce discerne: Such was the speed of this Celestiall Bird (To prosecute, and execute the Word Of his great Master) towards Dothan Downe, Alighting first vpon Mount Tabor's Crowne Amaz'd to see his Groues so sodaine greene, And Lawnes so fresh, with flowery tufts betweene. The Hill-born Nymphs with quauering warbles sing His happy-Well-come: Caues and Rocks do ring Redoubled Ecchoes; VVoods and VVinds withall, VVhisper about a ioyfull Madrigall. But th'Heauenly Herald, from the Mountain eying The Vale about, sees there the Brethren lying Along the Grasse, and busie at their Vittle, And from a Hill (thence distant but a little) Th'Arabian Merchants with their Camels, hard (As God would haue it) driuing thither-ward: Thence instantly he casts his gentle Eye, On wofull Ioseph; and immediately Descending swift, stands on the dungeons brim, Now shining bright with sodain light from him. VVherewith the Lad at once dismaid and ioy'd, The sacred Torch-man (to that end employd) In louely Shape, with sweet and liuely grace, Thus cheeres the Lad (himselfe a Lad in Face). Feare not, deere Ioseph, deere to God aboue. Thy Fathers God, who All doth guide and moue, Hath sent me hither from his heauenly Throne, To comfort and confirme thee, in thy Mone. First, Hence thou shalt be fre'ed: yet, behold, Twise, as a Slaue, thou shalt be bought and sold, Transferd to Memphis, and for many a yeere Shalt liue a Seruant and a Prisoner there. But if thou still haue in abhomination Strange Womens Loue, and strange gods adoration: If still with all thy strength with all thy heart Thou serue the Lord, and from him neuer start: If in his Waies thou walke, and doe his Will, He will be with thee, for thee, in thee still: So that where-ere thou goe, what-ere thou doe, Fauour and Fortune shall attend thee too. And that thou maist with greater confidence Contemne thy wrongs, and trust his Prouidence, Knowe for a certaine, he hath destin'd thee A high Estate, and glorious Emperie; And time will come, when Thou with me shalt view Thy former Dreames in euery part proue true; When as thy Brethren with selfe-guilty brow, And thy good Father shall before thee bow: When thy Compassion, paying good for ill, Shall saue their liues that meant thee first to kill: Shall feed their mouthes that thought thee once to sterue, And buy them seats that sold thee forth to serue; And not alone receiue themselues to grace, But them and theirs within thy Kingdome place; That grown at length in number like the sand, Thence the Almighty with a mighty hand (In spight of Enuie and Ambitious sway) May bring them dry-shod through the Crimson Sea, Directed safe in all their vncouth Way, By Fire by Night, and by a Clowd by Day; Through the drye Desart, plentifully fed With Quailes from Heauen, and Manna (Angels bread) Into a Land where Milke and Hony flowe; The happy signe of happier substance though: Where, in due Time (O haste ye Times away.) A Goulden Age shall see a glorious Day; A Day full oft to be fore-typ't, fore-told, Fore-promised by Prophets manifold; When from the Bosome of th'Eternall Sire, Th'Eternall Sonne (What may we So admire!) (The Spirit o'reshadowing of a Virgin-Mother) Shall take Man's Nature, and become your Brother; Old Adam's Guilt, and Yours to expiate, And wide re-open Heauen's long-locked Gate. Concluding heere, to Heau'n the Angell hy'd. Ioseph, though first distract and stupefi'd, With such a Glory (and confus'd a-space) Him re-collects, and re-erects his Face; Inlie reioycing, deepely rumining, All in his minde maturely pondering. And future Hopes confirme him passing strong, Gainst present feares, and all his Woes and Wrong; That cheerely thus, with heart and hands erect, His holy Vowes he doth to Heauen direct: Great King of Kings, that rulest All-abroad; My Fathers, Grandsires, and Great-grandsires God, Almighty Guide and Guard, still gratious be To Vs and Ours, whose trust is all in Thee. Especially, thy fauour, Lord I craue Towards my Father, ready for the Graue: And as as for Mee; how-euer please thee, deale Me sowre or sweet, or send me Woe or Weale; It shall be welcome, and I well content. Onely deere Father, if that Death preuent Mine eyes (vnworthy) of that wished Day, That long long-hoped, happy Holy-Day, When from thy Throne (whose Glory hath no End) Thine onely Sonne shall into Flesh descend; At least vouchsafe me, though in shadow dim, As in a Glasse to see and knowledge Him; And (thorough Faith) to feele the sauing Sauour Of this thrice-sacred, gratious, pretious Lauer. So, with an inward and deep sigh, he ceast. The while, Arabians (Merchants of the East) With Camels loaden with their Countrey Ware, Myrrhe Storax, Incense, the most choyce and rare, Comming from Madian, towards Ægypt bound, Were passing by, where on the grassie ground, The Shepheard-Brethren sate to eate and talke; And busie yet, their Teeth and Tongues did walke, Till on the sodaine they descry'd the Men. Whence Iudah thus begins: O Bretheren, Behold how God doth better farre prouide, Then we could plot (more safe for eyther side). For, to these Merchants if we sell the Lad, First, a good peace of Money will be had; Next, of our Brothers bloud we shall be cleere; And last of all, be sure no more to heare Or newes, or noise, or name of Ioseph here, Whether to Memph's or Marmorid's they wend. Therefore, forthwith one to them let vs send, The Mart to offer, and the Price to make, As of a Slaue; and bring their answer backe. They all agree, and one is sent away To driue the Bargaine;; while the rest assay About a Tree-trunke fastning fit a rope, And letting 't downe, to hale their Brother vp. And vp he comes as fresh as Maying Rose, Or Daffadill that in a Garden growes; As liuely Forme as yerst, as louely Face, Shining with signes of Gods assisting Grace. By this the Marchants with their Broker came, To see the Ware; and did so like the same, They stood not hucking, of the price to bate (So good, and so good cheap, who would not ha't!) But, who would ween (good God!) that euer He, That was præ-destin'd to such dignitie, To whom such Wealth and Honor should befall, Should thus be sould, and for a price so small? Saue that my Sauiour, Heire of Heauen and Earth, That God-begotten, holy Virgins Birth, Whom Angels serue, whom Cherubins adore, To Iewes his Iudas sold for little more; (Woe to His Soule, Woe to my Sinnes therefore!) As, Twenty Pence. O base and cursed Thrall! But, both sides pleas'd, Ioseph must suffer all. Now must he mount on his new Masters packe, Vpon his Camels double bunched backe; To trot to Nile-ward (neuer heard-of Nile) As proud and glad of such a Load, the while His gentle Beast, now easiest of the Troope, Aptest to stop, humblest at need to stoop To this new Rider, with a cheerefull Neigh, Lifts light his feet, and still he leads the way. Well: Now the Brethren haue their Brother rid, How shall his Fate, how shall their Hate be hid? Who to their Father the sad newes shall bring? This is the doubt: This they are hammering. In fine, they iump; first to send home his Coat (For they had stript him) and in bloud of Goat Deepe dipping it, Dan is instructed fit In this sad manner to deliuer it To aged Iacob, doubting nothing lesse, Than His mis-hap, or Their so Hatefulnesse. Father (said Dan) ranging within a Wood, Our Cur did find this Coat, thus stain'd with bloud. Not knowing therefore, whence, nor whose it is, Nor how it came, we thought it not amiss To shew 't you first, and after harken further, As you thinke fit, in case of Maime, or Murder. But, Father Iacob had no sooner sp'yd The spotted Coat, with bloud and durt bedy'd, But, drown'd in Teares, he teares his hoary haire, With Ashes sprent, and rent his garments there, And cries, Alas! deere Ioseph, staffe and stay Of all mine Age, so sodaine tane away! O! O! My Sonne, Who? How? What did befall, To murder Thee, to murder Me withall? Doubtless, no Man: some sauage Beast it was, Some hungry Boare, some hairie Beare, alas! Where are your Brethren? Quickly all of you, Through all the Woods go take a thorow view: You may perhaps at last yet light on him, Or finde at least some Part, some mangled Lim, Some wofull Relique, which I pray bring home, That I may giue it his last Rites, a Tombe: Or rather, let me goe my selfe to seeke, And finde my dead Sonne, or a Death, his Like: And saying so, downe in a swoune he slid, With much a-doo to be recouered. On th'other side, sad Ruben towards night, When th'Euening Star began to twinkle bright, When Sheep and Shepherds to their Cotes were gone All but himselfe, himselfe comes all alone Vnto the Caue, and calling twice or thrice, Why! Ioseph, Ioseph; when as none replyes, Dismaid, and doubting, lest in their disdaine, His Brethren there the silly Lad had slaine; He makes a shift to cut a Holmen Pole, And by that help, gets downe into the Hole, Lookes round about; but finding nothing there, Gets vp againe, as full of greefe and feare: Then, hopeless, leaues that search to seek the others; And by the Sheeps tracke, tracking of his Brothers, Soone findes them out; and out of them will know Both how, and where, they Ioseph did bestow. They tell him truly how it did befall. A little eas'd (though little pleas'd withall) To heare the Lad was yet aliue and safe (Though for his thraldome he did inly chafe) He thus aduises; Brethren, let vs hye Home to our Father, and our best apply To comfort him; Let vs informe him this, That the Arabians (as their manner is) Spying the Lad alone vpon the VVay, Pursu'd him, tooke him, stole him quite away; And while he struggled from them to haue got, With a light hurt he bloudied all his Coate. Which let some Shepheards boy or other bring (As hauing found it) to auer the thing; For there be many can affirme (no doubt) They lately sawe Arabians heere-about. This fitted thus, together home they goe, And doe their best to cheere their Fathers woe. But though perhaps with some smal hope relieu'd, Perpetually (alas!) he mourn'd and grieu'd, Nor could the Torrent of his Teares retain, Nor outward Solace inly entertaine; But day and night a bitter life he led, Mostly alone, although aliue, as dead. Meane-while, the Marchant well content &amp; glad, Holds on his Iourney, beares away the Lad; Wondring to see all things so sute his will, Weather so temp'rate, and the VVindes so still, The Waies so dust-lesse, and so durtlesse faire, The Sunne so friendly, and so fresh the Aire; Aboue their VVont: for, hauing Heauen to friend, With Ioseph, Graces, Hope, and Hap do wend. Now, hauing past Iudæa's confines quite, From a steepe Hill, they haue anon the sight Of stately Memphis lofty Towers and Walles, With glittering roofes of high &amp; sumptuous Halls. Amid a rich and pleasant Plaine, repleat With goodly Heards of Cattell, Sheep, and Neat, With goodly Corne-fields, heere &amp; there between: And, neere the Citie, on a spacious Greene, They might behold, as in some Martiall Muster, Thousands of Youth in seuerall Troops to cluster; Attending all, Some, manly Exercise; Some, light and speedy, running for a prize: Some, strongly actiue, wrastling for a fall, Some, hurling Sledges, till they sweat withall: Some, on swift Horse-backe to out-swim the winde; Some, to shoot backward at their foes behind: Some with their Launces ready coucht in Rest, Wheeling about, to charge in Flanke or Brest: Some, at the Tilt, in strong and steddy course, To breake their Staues, or beare down man &amp; horse. Whereon th'Arabians, with th'Isaacian Lad, (Now very neer) stood gazing, as right glad, And all most greedy of so various sorts Of Manly Proems, of so warlik sports. An Eunuch of the Kings, one much esteem'd, And Master of those Martiall Games (it seem'd) Seeing those Strangers, with so much delight Stand still so long in viewing all the Sight, Sends to inuite them kindly to come neere; And then perceiuing that they Marchants were, Began to aske, What Ware, what rare deuice, They had to sell? Nothing, said they, but Spice, And this yong Lad; VVhom, if Your Lordship like, Accept as Yours, and freely, we beseek: Or, if you nill accept him gratis, prize As please your selfe; your fauour shall suffize. Yes, said the Eunuch, I accept your Loue, And of Your Present I so well approue, And prize it so, You could not bring me better: The more my hope, the more am I your debter, Such grace his Face presageth to my minde; So shall you neuer me vngratefull finde, Said Potiphar: and then he takes the Lad; And causing him to be right seemely clad, In Silken suit, giues him a Liuory Of Purple, garded with Embroderie. Then on a goodly Horse he sets him vp, The stillest, yet the stateliest in the troope. Ioseph right ioyfull, from a bashfull Brow Returnes dumbe Homage, with a gracefull Bow Vnto his Lord: then, re-erect, appeares Taller and trimmer then were all his Peeres. Him, home before (thus furnisht) with a Guide, Sends Potiphar vnto his louely Bride. Now Hesperus the Euening on did bring; When, leauing Fields, the youthfull troops do ring About their Captaine, and attend, in State To guard him home triumphant to his Gate. And louely Ioseph, hauing had by this A view of his faire Lady-Misterisse; And of his Office, tutured at large, VVhat him belongd in his Lords Chamber-charge, Him humbly ranked (of his owne accord) Among his fellowes to goe meete his Lord. As burnisht Gold amid a heape of Sand, Or Orient Pearle among the Pebble Strand, Such seemed He, among tenne thousand Squires, VVhom Men and Matrones, yong and old admires: His pase so graue, his Face so gracious, His eyes and Feet still so officious About his Lord, as fixed still on Him, VVith steadie Looks, and with as ready Limbe: No lesse within doores then he was without, Actiue and apt in all he went about; On all occasions, in what-euer kinde, Of Bodie's Labor, or of Birth of Minde. But aboue all, his faithfull diligence, And mature VVisdome in all Managements, So well accepted and admired are, That not alone vnto his Trustie Care His Lord committed what before he had; But ouer All, him onely Steward made. For, Potithar perceiu'd that vnder Him, What-ere he had did thriue and prosper trim: His Fields and Flocks more fruitfull then before; His Fauours greater, and his Honours more: All which, inspired by some secret Test, To this young Ioseph he ascrib'd, as Blest. And th'Oracles of Egypt, then a-foot, Seem'd euen to point at, and perswade vnto 't. There was a Peach-Tree growing then amid God Camosh Temple, to him consacred, Which, brought from Persia long agoe, they say, When Isis yerst did all the World suruay, By her owne hand was planted, for Posterity, To be a famous Monument of Verity. Heereon, arriuing from farre wanderings, Bright-shining Apis with change-colour'd wings, Faire Apis settled; after whom did muster A mighty Swarme, which hung all in a Cluster Vpon one Bough. This wonder blowne abroad Among the Bards, they vouch that it did boad, Some Stranger should from forrein parts arriue; And after him, a mighty people hyue, Through whom the house of Potiphar should rise To wondrous Wealth and goodly dignities. Weening therefore these Augures all fulfild In Ioseph now, him euery one well-will'd, Him euery one accordingly respected, Him euery one for this the more affected. But, faire Iëmpsar (wife of Potiphar) Aboue the rest, his Parts did high prefer; Him more then All shee inlie did admire, And still beholds him with a young desire. Yet, ignorant what furie would ensue The pleasing Passion she did so pursue; VVhat wily Godling to beguile her, sought To snare her freedome in a seruile thought; As yet she vented neyther Sigh nor Teare: All yet was sweet, no bitter Fit, no Feare. Which th'enuious Prince of Styx and Acheron, Malignant Father of confusion, Mans deadly Foe, obseruing; and beside, That Isaac's seed still happy multipli'd: In fell despight, and full of desp'rate rage, He calls a bird of his infernall Cage, A cruell Harpy, full of wicked VVile, A thousand waies the wisest to beguile. Go, hye, saith He, my darling, hye thee quicke To faire Iëmpsar; she is Phant'sie-sicke Already. Therefore so insinuate, That more and more thou her intoxicate: Breathe in her bosome, blowe-in new infection, Kindle the Tinder of her light affection To such a flame, that neither Gods nor men May be of power to put it out agen: And, doe thy best (for that I most desire) If possible, set Ioseph (too) a fire: But, if on him, thou nothing canst prevaile, Returne to her, her Phantsie re-assaile, Fill her with Phrenzie, and with Furie double Still burne her fell, till all her Friends she trouble: Till with disgrace, disdaign'd and desperate, She turne her deere Loue to as deadly Hate: Till then, desist not; but persist and ply To play thy Part with Art and Subtilty. He, glad and ready for the worst of Ills, VVith Stygian puddle halfe a Viall fills, Blending some bitter, sharp-sweet wine withall. Then snatching quicke one of the snakes that craule About Alecto's grim and ghastly Browes, Away he hies to Potiphar his House, Within his bosome hiding what he had, And formally iust in the Form him clad Of Iphicle, the Lady Iempsars Nurse; With better credit, to beguile the worse. Then, to her Lady hauing made a ducke, Sweet Madam (said she, fie on all ill lucke) What sad disaster, what misfortune rife, Hath made poore Ioseph weary of his Life? My selfe, of late, haue seene him oft, forlorne Sit sole and sighing, and haue heard him mourne, Wishing for Death. And when I sought to knowe The secret cause of his exceeding woe: O! Mother (said he) whether I conceale it, Needs dye I must, or whether I reueale it. Inquire not therefore; for, tis better end, With my sad life my sorrowe's cause vnkend. Not so, my Sonne (said I) for oft a VVound Discouer'd, is recouerd, and made sound; Which, hid a while, would gangrene to the bone: Tell boldly (Lad) art thou in loue with none? If that be cause of thy distresse; Why Boy Be of good cheere, Thou shalt thy Deare enioy. Hope well, and haue well: So shalt thou; or else I'le charme Loues Passion with some stronger spels. With bashfull Blush, then said hee, Yes, I love: Bee witnes, gods, how earnest I have strove To strangle it! How I have labour'd long! How loth (alas!) my Lord in thought to wrong! More wishing Death: Death, now make good my triall: Happy were I to live and dy so loyall. And, saying so, on his fair Cheeks hee pours A Sea of Tears, in Pearl and Crystall showrs: So that, I see, without quick Remedy, For love of you, Madame, the Youth will dy. Alas! then said the Lady, Woe is mee For his Misfortune and his Misery; To mee right tragick is the tale you tell: For, truth to say, I love him but too well, And would enjoy him if I could or durst; But, O! I cannot: O! I may not: first, For sacred Lawes, for Hymen's secret yoke, (Which never any yet, vnpunisht, broke) For fear of danger, and dis-honours brand, And dreadfull vengeance of my Husbands hand. Why, my dear Daughter, damned Nurse replies, The gods doo laugh at Lovers injuries: And with thy Wedlock thou maist well dispense, On so good ground of so great consequence, As is the saving of a Life so yong, So innocent, that never yet did wrong; Vnless it bee a wrong to love too much, Or dy for Love (Who would not dy for such?). Lovers must dare, and Wise-men must not dread The worst of Dangers that is threatened: For, even the gods have Lovers in their guard, And Love and Pity they will still reward. I have a Water of a soverain vse (Th'extracted Spirit of many a Chymick Iuyce) Which, inly tane in a perplexed Case, Expels the Doubt, and shews Truth's naked Face; That, far from ambage, th'vndistract affection May of the better freely make election. If therefore, Madame, yet you stand divided, What Part to take; to have your doubts decided, I'll give it you: and, as shee spake, shee gave The hellish philtre made of Stygian wave. Thanks, dearest Mother, said her Ladiship: And, taking all, not with a fearfull sip, But full Carouse, lifting her hand on hy, Quaft off the poison, drew the goblet dry. This don, the Dæmon, with a Beldams face, Towards Iosephs chamber hies with hobbling pase; Where he was praying, and deuoutly praysing The God of Gods, for his so gracious raising: But when the false Fiend in his Portall spi'd A heauenly Warder (both his Guard and Guide) With threatfull brandish of a shining Blade, More speed then good, headlong he dounward made In dreadfull Maze; and, as the fowlest Fowle, Transformes him quicke into a Schrieching-Owle, Night's horrid Monster, houering long aloofe, At last pearcht on Iempsars Chamber roofe. The wretched Iemsar, hauing quaffed vp The brim and bottome of the Stygian Cup, Now all alone, she feeles her all a-fire, Bloud, Bones, and Marrow, burning in desire; Sad, silent, sighing, in a wondrous Fit; And all for Ioseph, nigh beside her wit, Now on her bed she falls, and by and by Flings vp againe; and to and fro doth fly From place to place; soone weary of the best, Runs euery where, and no where findeth rest; Like one whose brest a burning Feuer fryes, Or whom some Serpents sting doth agonize. At last she breakes out; and Alas! quoth Shee, What, what is this that thus tormenteth me? O! is it Loue? or was it not the Drinke I tooke right now? No: it is Loue I thinke, 'Tis surely Loue, Loue in extreamity, And but faire Ioseph gently help, I dye. Then help, Sweet-heart, come, be thou boldly mine: Come be my Loue, and I will still be thine. Both liuing louing, wee'll die guiltlesse both Of eythers blood: Be witnesse gods how loth I would incur so fell, so foul a staine, To kill such Louer with vnkind disdaine. Duly and truly, while I ought and could, I serued Hymen till (alas!) contrould By higher Godheads more Imperiall Right: He fauour me, as now I feele his might Farre, farre exceed weake Womans opposition. He will no doubt; and daigne vs both Tuition. Sith wont, himselfe, to loue, he as a Louer VVill pity Passions, and our pleasures couer. Thus hauing said, impatient of delay, Efren she calls (Efren a Maid, that aye Vs'd, as most trusty, diligent and charie, Her Mistresse Errands to and fro to carry) Goe quickly Efren, seeke me Ioseph out, And if the businesse he is now about Be not too earnest, and too instant too, But what he may as well heereafter doe, Bid him forth-with to come and speake with Mee. Wingd with her words, about it straight runs she: And, after summons, Ioseph comes anon Vp to his Lady; who then all alone, First with a Blush, and bashfull glanse among, From quiuering bosome, with a shiuering tongue, Thus breakes the Ice (still bidding him come neerer) Deare, my deare Ioseph, then mine own Eyes dearer. Shall I intreat thee, what I might command, To answer truly what I shall demand? Madame, said he, Should I be false to you? What ere it be, I sweare to tell you true. I heare (quoth she) that thou art deepe in Loue: If it be true (thou must thy Truth approue) Thou maist not hide it; though my selfe were she, For whom thou sufferest, thou must tell it me: Confesse it freely: and I must confesse As much to Thee; for, Thee I loue no lesse: So, louing Both, we shall haue mutuall Fewell, Nor Thou to Mee, nor I to Thee be cruell: Ioyne hands, ioyne hearts, how happy manifold! How great! how graç't! how will I heape thee gold! Thus she protests, and with a sodaine kisse Vpon his Lips she seales her Promises. He, red for shame, selfe-sadly ruminates His Heauenly Angels sacred Caueats Against Temptations and Attempts vniust, Of Idoles seruice, and vnlawfull Lust: Internall praying for supernall Strength, In modest manner Thus replies at length: Madame, what euer of my Loue you heare, How-euer feruent, or how deepely-deere; If you haue heard it, as (perhaps) impure, Vnchaste, vnhonest Loue; I you assure None loue I so; nor wish I (I protest) So to be lov'd: and of my Lady, least. My Lord, you knowe, hath nothing from me kept, I all command, onely your selfe except: And shall I then, disloyall, Traitor proue Vnto my Lord; and to My God aboue? No, God forbid: No, rather let me dye; And in the sands vnburied euer lye, A prey to Birds and Beasts: and as he spake, Her and her Chamber did he quick forsake. Shee, seeing then her Hopes so sodaine dasht, Her selfe deluded; as with Lightning flasht, Stands first a while mouelesse, amaz'd and mute; Then grindes a Groan, and many sighes pursue't; Then wrings her hands, falls backward on her bed, Distract in minde, her colour pale and dead. All which obserued by that Diueld-Owle, Vpon the Roofe, he putteth off the Fowle, And re-puts-on Nurse Iphicle a space, To visit Iempsar in so pitious Case. Alas! quoth she, What ailes my Lady deere? My tender Nursling, What hath hapned heere? Why are you daunted and deiected so? Be of good Cheere; be of good Comfort: Lo, I, I am heere; looke, on me, looke, my Lamb, Your helpe at need, your louing Nurse I am. At name of Nurse, her somewhat she erects, And with these Taunts a frowning glance reflects: Nurse, once a Nurse, or Mother more then Nurse, But now a Step-dame, or some Furie worse. Thou, thou hast kill'd mee, thou hast quite vndone me: Thou toldst me, Ioseph was enamoured on me Deep, to the Death; and when I come to proue him, Alas! he loues not, nor will let me loue him: Nay, Prayers, Proffers, Presents cannot moue him. Thou, thou hast made me make my selfe a mocke; To shame my Name, to staine my House and Stocke, To wrong my Lord, to breake my Faith, to fall; Thou wert the Author, thou the cause of all. What wanteth more, but with a murderous blade, This guilty Soule to send to endlesse shade? False Iphicle doth her as sharpe reproue; Ah, foolish woman, vnexpert in Loue: What wonder was it, if a bashfull boy, Vntraind, vntoucht (as Virgin) first were coy To heare of Loue, a Nouice, yet a Stranger, Doubtfull of you, perhaps; fearefull of danger. Twas not the course: you haue miscarried it. Then be not hartlesse, neither hopelesse yet; For I will once more vndertake the matter, Ile chide his rudnesse, and instruct him better How to behaue him: Haue you Patience But for three daies, and on the fourth from hence Will reigne a gracious Starre, whose milde Aspect On Loue and Louers gently doth reflect; Vnder whose Radiance, in Coniunction sweet, Hymen and Cupid in one instant meet. With these her Words Iëmpsar, part re-cheard, Her sinking heart againe a litale rear'd: Then Goe, said she, the Gods grant better speed: And that we may the better now succeed, VVe will the while the sacred Powers implore, Frequent their Altars, and their Shrines adore. Next morning therefore, by what time the Sun VVith glittering Rayes had gilt the Horizon, Iëmpsar decks her, goodly to behold, In Scarlet, set with Iewels and with Gold (But much more goodly for her louely grace, And natiue Beauties of her Forme and Face) And to the Temple with a Traine she tends, Of Matrons, Maidens, Seruants, Neighbors, Friends. Among the rest, the Steward also went, Faire-featur'd Ioseph, with his Eyes downe bent, As inlie pitying with a griefe vnshowne, His Ladies Passions as he did his owne: For, he suppos'd her gaite to Church had bin To seeke for Mercy, and forsake her sinne: But, nothing lesse; Shee all the gods requires, To friend her loue, and further her desires: And so the next day, and the next ensuing, And euery day still greater Gifts renuing, The reaking Entrailes of her Offrings viewing. But, when the fourth, long-wished, wel-come day Tytan 'gan burnish with his burning Ray, Haile, happy day (said shee) haile holy Lights, That fauours Louers, and that loue delights: And by your power and gratious Iuflnence, Preserue the VVorlds perpetuall Increments. And then she sends for the beloued Lad: Who, selfely good, suspecting nothing bad, Supposing now his Mistresse minde reclaim'd, At least from daring what before she aim'd, Comes instantly: Shee, by the Nurse seduc't, Presuming All to her content conduc't; No sooner spies him, but she springs for haste, About his necke her Iuory Armes she cast: Shee holds him, hugs him, saying, Welcome Mine, Mine, Mine thou art, and I am onely Thine: Then, VVhy delay we? VVhy defer wee thus Our ioynt delights, sith none can hinder vs? VVhy burn we Day-light? Hence with Feare and Sloth. Let's mixt our Loues. This Bed will serue vs Both. She leaps vpon't; and like a Nay-lesse Wooer, Holding his Cloake, she puls him hard vnto her. The goodly Youth, as beautifull as blamelesse, Amaz'd, asham'd, to see his Lady shamelesse, Replyes, Alas! (Thus sharpe reprouing her) Late Noble VVife of Noble Potiphar, What mood, what madnes hath obdur'd your mind, To dare these Pranks, vncomely and vnkinde? To shame your Selfe, your Sex, your House, your State, To wrong my Lord, and me vnfortunate? These are the fruites of Ease-full Idlenesse, Of wanton Pride, of wastfull Pamprednesse; From whence the Fiends (our foes) aduantage cull, To kill our Soules, and fill our Sins-sacke full: For, 'tis not Iphicle, your Nurse, your Friend, As you suppose: no, 'tis a hellish Fiend, A Hag, a Furie sent from Sulphury Styx, That thus deludes you with deceits and tricks: Shee dar'd, and did attempt to tempt me too; But, God forbad: she me no hurt could doe. I saw her shrinking out as I came in: I know the fained forme she masketh in: I feele the Sulphury fume, the filthy Sent She left behinde her, when away she went. He hauing spoken; from behinde the dore, The subtle Fury (lurking there before) VVith sodaine rush did crush the posts in sunder; And comming in, fills all with feare and wonder; When ghastly squinting, griezly, Thus she spake VVith hellish voyce: Indeed you do miss-take. False, Iphicle I am not: I am one Of th'Odious Sisters, sent from Acheron, I'll make you proue it now: then forth she drew A poysonous Snake, and it at Ioseph threw: But, th'Heauenly Warder still repeld it back, And all th'endeuours frustrate still did make. Vnable therefore Him to hurt at all, Towards Iëmpsar doth it softly crawle, With slippery windings, wriggling to and fro: Into her skirts at length it twineth so, That vp it creepes, and quicke into her gets, Gnawes all her bowells, and despitefull spets His hellish poyson in her inmost heart. The Lad, thus frighted, quick away did start, To his owne Chamber: and perplext in minde, Forgetfull he had left his cloake behinde. Seeing him fled, and feeling in her wombe The fretting Venome; wholly ouercome, In ragefull fury, sodainely she falls, And, Help, Help, Help, with a loud Cry she calls, So loud and shrill, that all the Court it heard, And all the house, and neighbours neere, it scar'd; As if within had been some sodaine fire Which instantly would to the roofe aspire. Helpe, Women, Help, quicke, quickly. O! the Slaue, The Iew, the Rascall, the yong Hebrew knaue, Euen now (O Gods!) finding me here alone, (O the bold Villaine! Hath the like been knowen?) Dar'd t'haue defil'd great Potiphar his Bed; And, but my Nurse me timely rescued, Had rauisht me (O, horrid thing to thinke!) But hearing Helpe, away the Slaue did slinke, And left, for haste, his Cloak behind him heere. With Hue and Crye, pursue him far and neere, Lay hold on him, and lay him fast in Hold; And let my Lord of his Abuse be told. Thus fell Iëmpsar her complaint prefers. All which, and more, false Iphicle auers, And aggrauates, adiudging him exempt From pitie, fit to hang for such attempt So insolent, so impudent; and whets The hearers hears. Then close away she gets, Vnseene, and Owle-like in a Clowd inuolv'd, Her borrow'd Body into Aire dissolv'd; Descending swift from whence she came, to tell Her good-ill seruice, and successe, in Hell. Poore Ioseph then his fellowes folly seaze; And, hasty, hurry him towards Little-Ease: Faine would he speake, but none would hear a word; None, none at all, and least of all his Lord, Whom the Report already had incenst; Yet not with Death to haue him recompenç't: But, in a Dungeon (worse then Death) to dwell, For worst Offenders the most loathsome Cell; There, kept Close-Prisoner to be barely fed With puddle-water, and with Barly-bread. But, better kept by his supernall keeper (Yet, more his dear, the more their woes be deeper) A winged Watch-man shining heauenly bright, Is sent to Ioseph (when the first sad Night With sable Courtin had beclowded all) Who entring (through the Wicket and the Wall) Into the Prison, with a new-come Ray Lightning the dungeon, driuing Night away, With spirituall Comforts, and with speeches kinde, Cancels his feares, and well confirmes his minde This, from a Tower th'Ægyptian Keeper spy'd: Some God, some God is in the Light, he cry'd. I know, such Splendor, and the speech I heard, If it be God, it must be needs inferd This Lad is guiltlesse of the crime pretended. For, Innocence iust IOVE hath aye defended. Thenceforth, to Ioseph bare he great respect; A kinde of Reverence, with a kinde Affect; Took off the Irons from his hands and feet; Fed, lodg'd him better, made his prison sweet; Visits him oft, intreats him friendly faire With loving Comforts; lets him take the Aire. Now, twice foure Roundles Phœbe had compleat, When, on suspicion of some treacherous feat Of poys'ning Pharao's Bread (as went the Fame) Two were committed from the Court (by name, The Kings chiefe Baker, and chiefe Buttler, too) To the same Gaile where Ioseph hath to doo. For, now his Keeper trusted him so deep, He made him Keeper, and of nought took keep. In short time after, Either, in one night, Dreamed a Dream; whence the next morrow light, Pain'd and perplexed, what they might portend, Too sadly serious seem'd they to perpend. Which Ioseph noting: Gentlemen, I pray, How hap (quoth he) you are so sad to day. To-night (sayd they) we dreamed each a Dream, But none we finde that can interpret them: And that's our trouble, Can you tell them me? Come, let me heare them, if you can, quoth he; I may please God we may haue sight therein. Right gladly, said the Buttler, I'll begin. Me thought I saw a green and goodly Vine, With three faire Branches, budding, blowing fine, Then flowring fresh, then swelling Clusters blush, Whose spumy Iuyce in Pharao's cup I crush, Which with my hand into his hand I raught, Whereof the King took-in his wonted Draught. Then, thus the Lad: I'll tell your Dreams Portent. First, by that goodly Vine your Life is Meant; The Buds, Flowers, Fruits, be fruits your selfe haue bore, Your Services, your Vertues here-tofore, Which shall be guerdon'd, you restor'd to grace; The three faire Branches are but three dayes space, When in your wonted manner you shall bring The wonted Cup vnto your Lord the King. Then, when with Pharaoh you shall gracious be (If I be worthy) but remember me, And that vnworthy I am heer detain'd. The Baker, hearing This thus right explain'd, Said, let me also, if you please, I pray, Report my Vision; and your Verdict say. Me thought I had three Baskets on my head: Two full of Flower, the third of finest Bread, Made with most Art and Cunning that I might; But, all anon the Birds devoured quite. Then sayd the good Interpre'r: Things to come Are known to God; Men often faile in some: Yet, what I ghesse and gather of this matter, I'll tell you true: I cannot, may not, flatter. That which you saw the Baskets filled with, Of diuers kindes, your Life betokeneth: The Flower your former, simple and sincere; The Bread, your later, compound (as it were) Of all deceipts, Theft, Plotting, Poysoning, Treason, and all discover'd to the King; Who, for reward of these fowle Crimes, by Law Will hang you vp: and then the Birds you saw, Rav'ns, Vultures, Eagles, Kites, and carren Crowes, Shall eat your Carcass, peck your Eyes and Nose. Whithin three dayes, your Baskets number notes: Yet I may erre, and you may change your Lots. For, God doth change, when Men doo change from ill, His mediate Work, not his immediate will. This past, their Parts both divers pondering, On the third day came Warrant from the King, To cleare and to declare the Buttler Quit, And hang the Baker, at first sight of it. Accordingly, from Prison both are brought; But, to a diuers End, with diuers thought: Th'one with reproach, th'other with good report; Th'one to the Cart, th'other to the Court; Th'one to the Gallowes, th'other to be grac't Of Prince and Peers, and in his roome re-plac't; With Caps and Claps, with cheerfull shouts and songs Welcom'd, rewarded, honor'd for his wrongs. Thrice through the Zodiak had Hyperian pranç't, And fourthly now his fiery Teem advanc't, When quiet stretcht vpon his Ivory bed, In sweetest sleep, well toward Morning-sted, To mighty Pharao the Almighty sent A double Dreame, of so deep Consequent, That wondring much, the King awoke withall, Conceiving it some high Prognosticall. Wherefore, forth-with he summons farre and wide, Through Ægypt and Chaldæa, from each side, All that had knowledge in Astrologie, Cunning in Spels, or Skill in Prophecie, Or could fore-tell by Magick from below; Or from aboue, by Oracles fore-show; Or by in-sight of Sacrificed Heards; By Fire, by Water, or by Flight of Birds, Or by their Songs; by Sand, by Geomancy; Or by what-ever Heathen Feat or Phantsie. Then swarm'd the Court with Sages of all sorts, Of divers habits, and of divers ports. Som on their Heads wore Hornes, hairy &amp; horrid, Som with thick Turbands did surround their forehead, Som with high Miters, som with trayling whoods, Som with rich Garlands, set with precious Studs; But, broad long-bearded all, adown their Chin, With sad aspect, and of a sallow skin. Whom when before him Pharaoh had admitted, He tels his Dreams, first; then (as him befitted) Propoundeth Honors and rich Recompence To whom-soever shall expound the sense, And sets them dayes, and nights, and times, and houres, To bring their Answer: But (beyond their powers) Daies, Nights, Times, Houres, they break, none doth appeare T'explaine the Dreame, or the Kings doubt to cleare: Neither their Spheres, Spels, Circles, Sorceries, Birds, Beards, nor Miters, could decypher This. Angry therefore, and thence forth grieuing deep, The King would heare none, but did priuate keep. The Buttler then remembring (at the last) During his Durance what before had past, (Which hitherto, as Courtiers, yet, for most, Good Turns receiv'd, he had forgot, or crost) How truly Ioseph by their Dreams did tell, What to the Baker and himselfe befell; Fell on his knees, and cryes vnto the King, Pardon, My Liege, my stolid lingering To tell your Highness, in this manner moov'd, What (late) in prison I both saw and proov'd. Your Maiesty (no doubt) remembers yet, Your Baker and my selfe you did commit To your High Marshals Tower; where then we found An Hebrew Youth, a Prisoner (on false ground, As may be ghest) late Page to Potiphar. Both growne in time with him familiar, Both of vs dreamed in one very night; Both of our Dreams to Him we did recite; Both he expounded; and both did succeed To both of vs, as he of both did reed. To me, sayd hee, Thou shalt in three daies space, Returne to Court, recover Place and Grace: But, to the Baker; Thou (said he) that day Shalt be hangd vp, for rauening Birds a Prey, Vnlesse thy faults thou canst so quick repent, That change of life thy threatned death prevent: (For, God doth change, when men do change from Ill, His mediate Work, not his immediate Will.) All which, for True, before your Eyes is cleer; The Baker hang'd: and I your Buttler, heer. Vpon my Life, my Lord, your hidden Dream That Lad will read: he hath som Spirit supreame. Herewith the King re-cheerd, and inly glad, Commands him straight, Go, quickly fetch the Lad, And in Our Name him instantly inlarge. Forthwith he hies him to perform his charge; Gets forth the Prisoner, shifts him, suits him prest, Of his owne cost, and hath him barb'd and drest; And then conducts him, bashfull, to the King; Who well beholds the Lad, likes every thing; Then questions thus: They tell me, Youth, that you Interpret Dreams; now, tell me, Tell they true? My gracious Lord, said Ioseph, God alone Immediately knowes Dreams; and other none, Saue onely such to whom that sacred Gift Th'Almighty daignes: I may my Prayer lift Vnto my God for you, my Lord, and shall: It may be, He will grant this grace withall. For, ay with speciall care he guides the things, That long to Kings; as onely King of Kings. A while then inly did he meditate: Then, prayes the King his Visions to relate. Me thought, said Pharaoh, by Niles bank I stood, And suddenly from out the silver Flood, Came seaven faire Kine, which ranging far and wide, Fed in the Meads along the Rivers side, On Ox-lips, Cowes-lips, Trifole and the rest, Which for the Altar fat our Beasts the best. Scarce had I turn'd mine eye, when on the shore, Me-thought in th'instant came vp seaven Kine more, With staring haire, too-weak to stand alone, Ill-favoured, lank, and leane, bare skin and bone; As, poorly fed, With Holly, Broom, and Heath, Anatomies, or living Formes of Death. Amaz'd with this, yet was I more anon, When these (me thought) for hunger, set vpon The former seaven, and so to work did fall, That suddenly they had devour'd them all. Heerwith I waked: and anon agen Sweet slumber caught me, and I dreamed then I saw seaven goodly full fair Eares of Corne, Rise from one straw, scarce able to be borne: And by and by, seaven other Ears there sprung Light, chaffie, blasted, thin and closely clung, Which in like manner greedily did eat And quick consume the seaven full Eares of Wheat. These were my Dreams, which I haue oft propounded To many, yet by none can be expounded. Now, if for Thee this Honor be reserv'd, If Thee alone my deeper Dreams deserv'd; Then, happy Youth, reioyce with all thy hart, Eternall Fame shall trumpet thy desert: And, with Reward we shall so richly store thee, That in all Ægypt none shall be before thee. Great King, said Ioseph, both your Dreams be one, Sent down from God, to be reueal'd by none (How-ever wise, how-ever full of Parts, How-ever compleat in all depth of Arts) Saue by som Vessell of his owne Election, To whom he daignes the grace of his direction: And therefore could your Sages nothing show, Not knowing God, though All-things else they know. Know this, O King: God by This Vision sends, To let you know what shortly he intends. Your seaven fat Bullocks are seaven fruitfull yeers, Which through all Ægypt shall oreflowe your shiers, While Nile, far fatter than to-fore he wont, Shall farder spread his slimy Sweat vpon 't; When happy Memphis shall such Plenty see, That your old Barnes shall, all, too little be: Your Rieks, your Garners, and your Bartons, All, Too narrow for your Crops, too short, too small: And, to confirme it, that it shall be so, Your seaven full Eares but the same thing fore-show. Now be you pleas'd, my great and gracious Prince, To heare the rest with heed and Patience: For, seaven poor years these seaven rich years shall follow, Whose Penury their Plenty soon shall swallow; When Nile shall shrink into his Chanell, nye Leaving the Ridges and the Furrows dry, Fields scorched, parched, burned even to dust, Both Solstices like deawless and adust: To Torrents gushing from the Mountain tops, Nor (vnder Cancer) on the Æthyops Any return of Winter's Moist again, Nor any help of sweet and timely Rain: So that the Husband cannot plough his Land: Or if he could, he should but plough the sand, And cast his Seed amid the same to burn, Without all hope of any Crops return, Or of increase: but rather prest, for need, To quit his Plough, and on his Oxen feed. Your seuen leane Bullocks, and seuen slender Eares, Deuouring, shew these seuen deuouring yeeres. This is your Dreame, O King; and doubled Thus, That, more assured, more solicitous, More speedily you may prouide before (Thus warn'd by God) a Salue vnto this Sore. Which, how to doe, (of me if you demand: I would aduise you first through all the Land, To build new Garneis, long and large enough, From time to time to store vp all the stuffe, That may be spared throughout all your State, During those Yeares of Plenty fortunate; Allowing onely for each Households need, And for their Land, a Competence of Seed. You must haue also Treasure ready still To buy this Store, if well proceed you will. And to this end, let there a man be sought Discreet and wise, to wield it as it ought. Let him haue power as in your Royall Name, Through all your Kingdome to dispose the same; And vnderneath him to subordinate Sub-Officers, to serue him and the State. Thus Ioseph counseld: &amp; the while the King, With silence, all maturely pondering, A last breakes out in ioyfull admiration, There is (no doubt) a Diuine Inspiration In this yong man. Without a spirit Diuine, Of future things, none could so deepe define: There is none like him, none to match him neere, In all Chaldæa, nor in Egypt heere. Then, on his necke, shedding a showre of Ioy, The King imbrac't, and kindely graç't the Boy; Then, thus bespake him: Seeing God hath giuen Thee this to know, and to foreshew, from Heauen; I know not one so wise and so discreet, Nor for this Office than thy selfe more meet. Thee, next to Me, shall all my people serue, And call thee Sauiour: Thou dost them preserue. Then, on his backe a Purple robe he dons, Embossed round with rich and Orient Stones; About his necke a massie Chaine of Gold, And on his finger (as they wont of old) A royall Signet, a most precious Ring (Not to be worn by any, but the King, Or his Vice-gerent, whom he doth esteeme And will haue deemed Second vnto Him) Which Pharaoh there then plucked from his owne, To put on Ioseph's, that he might be knowne To be the Second to Himselfe, in all. Then, on a Steed, the second in his Stall, (Or seçond Chariot) in this solemne Pompe He makes him ryde; and with the sound of Trumpe Proclaimes before him, that they bow the knee To his Vice-gerent, to This Second Hee, To this Preseruer of their State; or rather To this (adopted Sonne) their Countries Father; This Prince of Worth; this more then Man, this Miracle, This happy, holy, Heauen-inspired Oracle; Who, the Kings Dreames in time interpreting, Had sav'd themselues, their Country and their King. With all these Honors, and with Wealth conferd, With all applause good Ioseph is preferd, To rule all Ægypt: which with great Dexteritie, Wisedome and Worth, Care, Courage, and Sincerity, He executes: And first, his Circuit rides O're all the Land; Barnes euery where prouides, Which in those Plentious Yeeres he fils with Store, Of euery kinde. And, sith it is no more Vertue to purchase than preserue what's got, He slips no time, but prudently doth plot To kill all Vermine, cut off all Excesse Of Gluttony and beastly Drunkennesse; Abates their need-less Beasts, Dogs, Mules, and Horse, Rids idle Roagues and Vag'rants, that be worse; And rather buyes-in, from the Coasts about, Than by a Licence lets a Corne goe out. Thus he proceeds: and God so blest his hand, That all things prosper'd ouer all the Land. There was a City call'd Heliopolis, (Whose Surname from the Sunne deriued is) Whose Prince (a Priest too, to Apollo's Grace) Had one faire Daughter, (faire indeed of Face And outward Feature; but, much more diuin'd For inward Beauties, Graces of the minde) Whom Phœbus, oft consulted with, had show'n, Not to be matcht to any of their Owne But, by a higher Fate, reserv'd to be A Strangers Bride, with greater Dignity To raise her Name, and honor her Posterity. This Oracle at Ioseph points in Verity, Thinks Phœbus Priest and great King Pharaoh, too: And to this end th'Isaacian Prince they wooe. When Ægypt now seuen happy yeeres had had; All plentifull, all prosperous and glad; It pleas'd the King, with Royall Pomp and State, These Nuptiall Bands to knit and consummate With sumptuous feasts; and to (prolong their ioyes) With Tilts and Tourneys, Dances, Maskes, and toyes, So long; that now the seaven rich Years, at last, Were ended all, and all their Plenty past. And now, Sol's Palfreys, having past the Twins, Were posting hotly towards Cancers Innes, When the Ægyptians could no more perceiue Nile's over-flood, nor any mud to leave; But, pure, vnpuddled on the sand to slide, And in his Bottom him well-neer to hide: Their whilome fertill soyl now serely riues, Yawnes wide for thirst, no hope of Harvest gives: If any seed be sowne, it never springs, Or never buds, or never bears, or brings Vnhappy Darnell, or dry Poppy seed, Or is devour'd by Vermines hungry breed. So that they live of former Years remains, Which hardly yet the first hard Year sustains; But men are faine to Grass and Rats to fall, To harmless Creatures, vnclean Beasts and all. Then, to the King, Citie and Countrey fly To sue for Comfort, and to seek supply: He to his Vice-roy Ioseph them refers; He, instantly to vnder-Officers, Who (by His Order) furnisht all their Wants, At equall Price; yet do so high advance The Kings advantage, that from farre and nye The Wealth of all runs to his Treasurie; His Checquer's full: yet had they past (alas!) Scarce foure hard years, and had three more to pass. What shall they do, poor soules? How will they shift? Now nothing haue they, but their bare Lands left: Those they would sell; but, Who (Alas!) should buy? None hath the Purse, except the King. They try The Prudent Vice-roy: who approues the thing, Bargains and buys a Fift part for the King. This Famine raging fiercely every where, Fame bruits abroad (which came to Iacobs eare) That yet in Ægypt they were stor'd so well, That they had Corne enough, and som to sell: Old Izrael therefore calling vp his Sons, You see, faith he, our short Provisions: You see how like we are to starue and pine, And perish all, without the hand Divine: I heare there's Corne in Egypt to be bought; Me think ere now, you should your selues haue thought It time to goe: Goe, get you quickly thither, Take Coyne and Sacks: goe hye you all together, Saue Beniamin. The other Ten agree, And, furnisht fit, set forth immediately. Arriv'd in Ægypt, they eft-soons enquire The Great Corn-Master; lowting lowe, desire Corn for their money. Ioseph knows them brim To be his Brethren: but they know not Him. He well remembers their vnkindness past, (And, wrong receiv'd, draws strong revenge too fast.) Yet, for Gods sake, his Fathers, and his Brothers (Young Beniamin's) he spareth all these others; And speaks to Them, but strangely and austere: Whence? what are you? you (Sirs) that cluster there? My Lord, Your Servants are one Iacobs Sonnes; We come from Canaan (where our Father wonnes) Compeld by Famine (which there rageth sore) To seek your Favour; of your happy Store, To daign vs for our Money what you may. Our Father hath great Houshold to defray, Himselfe, Eleven of Vs, our Little Fry, Shepheards and Bondmen a great company: And therefore hither are we come, my Lord, To crave the Help your Favour may afford, To saue so many liues, that may be able, And shall be willing (som way serviceable) To thank your Lordship: for, our Father raigns As King in Sichem, and hee stocks the Plains With goodly Flocks of many Thousand Sheep, And store of Cattle of all kindes doth keep: Vouchsafe vs therefore of your Corn, we pray, That we may liue, what euer price we pay: For, we come hither, not to beg, but buy. To buy? said Ioseph; nay, I doubt to spy: Spyes are ye all; so many sturdy Clownes To troop at once through all our Forts and Townes, To view and to survay our Strength and store, And so the weakness of the Land explore. Ye tell me of your Father and your Brother: But, I beleeue neither the one, nor other: Where's your Commission? Where's your Fathers Test? Why came not that one Brother with the rest? Or why came you so many? It is clear You come to spy: and you shall buy it dear. Thus, though his heart doth melt, his bowels yerne; He faines him fierce, and bears him roughly sterne. They, prostrate all, beseech him not suspect Them any such. Our comming was direct, We sweare (say they): The witness we implore Of th'onely God our Father doth adore, Our Father sent vs; Famine droue vs hither; For Corne we come: and that we come together, Our need, our number, and our distance, craue At once as much as we at once can haue: Our other Brother is but yet a Lad (And all the comfort that our Father had) Too young to travell such a iourney yet; Which, vpon vs our Father laid, more fit. We thought on no Commission: for, indeed In such a case we thought there none should need. Be good vnto vs, good my Lord, we pray, Pittie our Father, and (if pittie may Pearce you at all) pittie our Brothers case, Pittie our Babes, the hope of all our Race. Twixt ouer-ioyd, his eyes will needs run over; Which, yet a while, he turnes aside to cover: Then, thus returnes; Your cunning answer showes That you are false. Truth needs not such a Glose: I am resolv'd; and can beleeue no other. By th'Life of Pharaoh, till you fetch your Brother, You shall not hence, one Hostage shall remaine, The rest shall goe well loden home with graine: This favour will I doe, expect no other, Nor moue me more, vntill you bring your brother, To testifie your Stories are not lyes: Else, by the Life of Pharaoh you are Spies. (Heer, Sirra, Marshall, take them to your charge, Look none of them be let to goe at large) I'll giue you three dayes Respit, to revolue; Then let me heare what herein you resolue. They (inly prickt in their owne conscience For cruelties committed, now long since, 'Gainst this their vnknowne Brother, now a Prince) Among themselues debating what was best (Seeing the Vice-Roy did so deep protest) Thought most expedient, and resolue in briefe, To send home Nine, loden with such reliefe, To fetch their Brother; leaving one behinde: Which Part, by Lot, to Simeon was assign'd; Whom they for Hostage to the Prince present, (Vpon the third day) with their full intent. Then he conmmands their Sacks with Corn be fill'd: They pay for it; but, secretly he will'd, That each mans money should againe be put Into his Sack, and then the Sack re-shut. So, now their Hostage in safe custodie, They lade their Asses, and full heavilie Leaue Ægypt and their Brother; hying home, Vnto Samaria: where no sooner come, But, their olde Father, forthwith missing one, Cryes, Where's your Brother? Where's my Simeon? What, is he sick, or dead (I doubt me rather)? Neyther, said Iuda, dead, nor sick, good Father: Hee's well in Health, but doth for pledge remaine In Ægypt, till we all goe back againe, And bring with vs our Brother Beniamin: For, such conditions must we enter in, Or else we could haue brought you nothing thence. The Man we dealt with, a Great Man, a Prince, Next to the King, at our arrivall there, Askt many questions, whence, and what we were: Whether we had a Father, or a Brother, In what estate, how olde; and many other. We, doubting nothing, told him truly all: Then, more austere, and more maiesticall, Now I perceiue (saith he) that you are Spies, And all your Answers are so many Lyes: You come but to survay our Strength, and Store, To finde our Weakness, and our Wants explore: You tell me of your Father and your Brother; But I beleeue neither the one, nor other. Where's your Commission? Where's your Fathers Test? Why came not that one Brother with the rest? Or, Why came you so many? It is cleare, You come to spy, and you shall buy it deare. We answerd for our selues the best we could: All would not serue: Th'issue was this; we should Leaue one for Hostage, and the other Nine Should bring home Corne, and bring him Beniamin, Or never to returne vnto that place, Or never dare to looke him in the face: For, by the Life of Pharaoh, we were spies, (That is his Oath) and all our Words were Lyes. Good Father Iacob, having heard all this, With many a sigh (as sorrowes manner is) Is there, saith he, vnder the Heav'ns bright Ey, Another Father so distrest as I? One Sonne is lost; another, Prisoner lest In a strange Land; another, now bereft (By your device, or your advice at least) And all of you (I doubt me) all the rest To be extinct, while I surviue in feares Of so bad news to come to my sad eares. First would to God (so God were not displeas'd) My dayes were ended, and my sorrowes eas'd. Thus speaking wept he, and thus weeping spake. His Sons with Comforts seeke his Care to slake, Saying, The Godly should not feare so deep, Sith God his servants will more safely keep. Then to their Sacks: Each having his vnknit, Each findes his money in the mouth of it. Amazed all: sad Iacob, there-upon, Sons, Sons (said he) there lackt but this alone: This is enough to kill all Hope (as vaine). For, if to Egypt you returne againe, The mighty Man that fain'd you Spies before, Will finde you Theeues now; and what need he more, Having so sifted, and so sought your Coat, To finde a hole, that he might cut your throat? No, no (I sweare) my Beniamin, my Boy, Mine onely comfort left, mine onely Ioy, I will not hazard on so tickle ground: You, you shall goe that are so promise-bound, If you think good, and God will haue it so: And when you are determined to go, I'll giue you all the golden good I haue, Iewels and Coyne, your brother to vn-slaue And saue your selues; and to bestow in Corne, If God be pleased that you shall returne. On th'other side, against his Fathers Feares, Sad Iudah thus intreats him, even with Tears. Deare Father, heare vs first; and then I pray Haue Care of vs, and of your selfe this day. For, how shall we vnto that Man returne, Who solemnly hath by his Pharaoh sworne, Except we bring our brother Beniamin, Nor we, nor he that is there cooped in, Shall be dismist: nor shall we haue the grace To heare his voyce, or ever see his face; Where, God he knowes, what shall of vs become: And how much better shall you be at home? How will you liue? Where will you haue to feed This multitude, if there we doe not speed? Father, for Gods sake follow my aduice: Vpon my perill, stand not off so nice. This Lad will saue both vs and you, and all; And, on my life, no hurt shall him befall: Two tender pledges leaue I heer of mine; If he miscary, let Them pay the Fine. Then doubt not, Father, lay your feare aside, And prudently for you and yours prouide. That thus our money was return'd; no doubt, By his direction it was brought about: But, for a pit-fall, or for Pittie, rather, It is vncertaine: this is certaine, Father, He is reported, over all that Coast, To be a good man, and a godly-most; And, if the Whole be partly ghest by Part, We saw some tokens of a tender heart: For, while to him we there did sad relate The sad distresses of our present state, Of you and of our Brother, and our Brats; Our miseries he so compassionates, That he even wept: which though he thought to hide, And turn'd away, yet many of vs spy'd. Wherefore, good Father, let vs lose no time; Prolong no longer, neither doubt the Clime, Nor feare the man, nor faint for any thing: We shall be safe vnder th'Almighties wing. This, vrg'd with teares; the Old man, overcome, Cryes, Go on Gods name, God re-guide you home: Goe when you will, and with you take the Lad, And some best Presents that may heer be had In this hard time; Myrrhe, Storax, Almonds, Hony, Cumme, Cinnamon, and therewith, double Mony, Both for the former which you brought againe, And for the New, if Now you shall obtaine. And We the while will pray and pay our vowes, To th'everlasting Patron of our house, The Lord of Hoasts, our Fathers God and ours, To prosper and protect you with his pow'rs. Blushing Aurora sweetly peeping out, When Sol againe had brought his Teem about, The Father and the Sonnes, together all, All vp and ready, on their knees doo fall In due Devotion, as they daily wont: Then to their Breakfast (not to dwell vpon 't) Furnisht of what their Iourney did require, Gifts, Money, Beniamin. Their tender Sire, Weeping, Him kissing, and imbracing, Thus Bids sad Adieu: Deare Son, Ay prosperous Thy iourney be. If Fates thee safe restore. Then wish I life; for Teares he could no more. Then to the rest; imbracing, blessing all, While all for Blessing on their knees do call. They to their long-hard iourney fettling them, Leaving Samariah and Ierusalem; Past Idumæas Palmy Groues, and past Syrbonian Moors, Arabian Desarts vast; At length arriue on Egypts wealthy Coast, And reach at last their Menphis wished most. Whom gladly Ioseph entertaineth there, And instantly lets out his Prisoner. Admitted then to gracious Audience, Thus Ruben spake: When we, Right Noble Prince, Returned home, had to our Father done Your high Commands, touching his younger Sonne, Whom you required to be hither brought; Opening our Sacks to shoot the Corne we bought, In every Sack we found our severall Summe (Which God he knowes, we know not, how should come.) Our Father hearing what was come to pass, And, seeing it, deep-sighing, cry'd, Alas! Alas! My sonnes, I see some sad Mis-hap Hangs over vs: and all our old good hap Is crost and canceld. Sees Heav'ns glorious eye Another Father so distrest as I? Twelue sonnes I had, and one (alas!) is lost; Another, Prisoner in a forren coast; Another, now (mine onely comfort left) Surrepted Thus, and You withall bereft: And all of you to goe I wot not whither (Made Theeues) perhaps to perish all together. We comfort, We thus press, with all our powers; O Father, trust our Fathers God and ours. And for the Man that now in Ægypt swayes, He is most iust, most gentle. Him they praise For their Preserver, and their Father there Pious and pure: then, What is thence to feare? Wonne with our words, at last with much adoo, He granted vs to bring his Darling too. Go then, sayd he, God to and fro direct you; And with his wings of Favour still protect you. Take with you Beniamin; and take withall (Such as our Countrey yeelds) these Presents small, Gumme, liquid Storax, bitter Almonds, Honey, Myrrhe, Cinnamon: take also double money, To pay both for the Corne you had before, And for as much as now you shall bring more: And to that iust Man (as you say) commend Me and my Sonne: pray him to stand a friend, To pittie Him, and You, and Me, and All. So all good Hap to Him and you befall. While this he spake; The Prince, with much adoo Refraining Tears, cries, Welcome all of you, Your Selues, your Presents, and your Brother heer, Who quits you from suspect: Be of good cheer, Goe wash your weary Limbs from soyl and sweat, And soon I pray come sit with me at meat. Thus said the Prince. The servants, som prepare Bath for their Feet; som, Vessels; som, their Fare; But try and Pantry, som; som spread the Table; And other-som, as busie in the Stable. Him-Self the while dispatcht affaires of State, Heard Suits for Food, appointed each their Rate; And then returnes vnto his Guests again; Showes them his stately House, his Stuff, his Train, His gold and silver Plate, ingrav'n, imbost, Couches and Carpets of a wondrous Cost; And round about, most sumptuous to behold, Deep Arras Hangings, all of silke and gold, Of sundry Stories there so lively wrought, That, almost, living were the Figures thought; Such sprightly Postures, and so speaking Gestures, So natiue Visages, so naturall Vestures. Faith-famous Abra'm, after Heav'ns behest, Leads heer his Isaac to be kill'd, as Beast. The Lad heer loads the Asse with Holmen sprayes: The Father makes the Pile: Hereon he layes His bond-led, blind-led Son: his hand, heav'd vp, An Angell holds, and there is held a Tup. There, Iacob, flying his rough Brothers wrath, Hyes him amaine towards his natiue Path, His Fathers ancient Seat, and happy Realm, Betwixt swift Tigris, and th'Euphratean Stream; There, at a Well his Vncle's Daughter aides, Drawing vp Water for the tender Maids: There, on the Downes he tends their Fathers sheep, Serving for Rachel double Prentiship. While Isr'els glad Sons (at this wealth amaz'd, Now full of Hope, on these things greedy gaz'd, Great Ioseph calls (for, Supper was gone vp.) Come, give vs Water: It is time to sup: Then, tall, he sets him in his Ivory Chaire, And bids them sit, and treats them wondrous faire. Heer, Death preventing Fracastorius, This, late begun, He left vn-ended Thus. FINIS.

I know, the Field of His Yong HIGHNES heart So duly till'd by Your deep Care and Art (Adding His Fathers Royall golden Writt; And goodly Practice; to demonstrate it: His (late) rare Brother's Pattern, of Renowne: With Honest Quin's new-cast Prince-Worthy Crown: And holy Promptings of that reuerend Payre, Milborne and Hackwill, from the sacred Chaire) That little needs Hee the Stagyrian's store, The Corduban's, or the Attik-Muse his Lore: Much lesse (alas!) My silly Muses Myte, With borrowed Feathers to aduance his Flight. Yet sith, too-often, to a tender Eare, Too-serious Lectures sound but too-severe; Especially, to Princes dainty Taste, They seeme but harsh, and will not down in haste (As holesom'st Dishes, if but homely drest, Some queasie Stomachs hardly can digest): Let me presume (with your good leaues) a while To imitate Physicians honest Guile; Who, oft, in Sugar sheathe their bitter Pills, The better so to Cure vnwilling Ills, When wayward Patients, for the Sugars sake, Take-in their Health, which else they would not take. Sad Rules of Patience, Abstinence, Austeritie, Humility, Frugality, Sincerity, Religion, Labour, Care of Common-Wealth, And Manie, meet for Prince and Peoples Health; Which hardly can, in their Owne Likenes, sink In Youth-full Mindes (scarce in their Eares, I think) How grauely oft, with greatest Diligence Prest; and imprest with Tullian Eloquence: Sweetly disguis'd, in artificiall Sutes, Dauncing the Measures after Delphian Lutes, Washed in Nectar, wrapt in sugred Verse, Enter more easily, and more deeply perce. This I endevour: and to This Intent I summon CHARLES to Vertues PARLAMENT. TO THE HIGH-HOPEFVLL Charles, Prince of Great-Britanne Where witty Bertault (in his Fancy) meant But a faint Præsage of His Prince of France; Our Hopes of Ours the better to aduance, We haue presum'd to cal a PARLAMENT; Where Royal Vertues from Olympus sent, By seuerall ACTS of sacred Ordinance, Conform, confirm Your future Gouernance; So please it Heav'n Your hart and hand consent. O! please it Heav'n, You may be pleased Thus, These Works to imitate, These Acts to act; To proue your self, This same PANARETVS, When future Age shall see our Hopes in Fact. Which, while I pray; sweet Prince, in humblest sort I cite Your HIGHNES to This Soverain Court. To Your Highnes Seruice humbly-devoted, Ios. Sylvester. TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE Lords Spirituall and Temporall: The Knights and Burgesses of the Lower-House: And to all generous and ingenuous Readers. Presuming all Your Lordships will appear, Not by your Proxies, but in Person, Heer; And in your Turnes say (Every-one) Content, To Every Act, in Vertues PARLAMENT: I humbly bring You Every-one A Briefe Of every Bill; or, at the least, the Chiefe. These All are Publike Acts: Priuate, This Session Hath passed None: but in the next Impression, Your Acts of Bounty, and the rest of Mark, Shall be recorded, By Your Vnder-Clark, Iosvah Sylvester. PANARETVS. Yeares timely Turns, vnto a Lustre run, Brought forth at last the long-long wished Sun, Whereon our Hopes our iust Desires pursewd, To see our Princeling with a Name indewd (Which, Since Wee saw, or heard that happy sound, Saturn's slowe Teem had trotted twice the Round) When, lo, Th'Etern All-Maker's Maiestie, Quick-darting down his All-discerning Eye, Whereby his Goodness all his Works doth guide; And seeing prest the sacred Pomp and Pride (As in so solemne Mysteries is wont) T'adorn the Altars and the hallowed Font; In th'instant summons with a gracious beck Nine nimble Scouts, which scudding light and quick, Dispatch more speedy then a Thought the things Aboue inoynd them by the King of Kings, Who, with a mildly-most-maiestick gest, In heavenly words, his pleasure thus exprest: The young French Dolphin is euen ready Now To take the Name my fore-Decrees allow: A frequent Name of Kings, and famous farre; Wonders in Peace, Thunders in dreadfull Warre; And, One of them, more excellent in Grace, Among my Saincts hath iustly held a place. But yet, besides that Name, which France affects For one Man's vertue, and for due Respects; Besides that Name, which onely Men have given, I'll giue him one my Self, as sent from Heaven; And such a one, as one-day, by Events Shall proue it a true Præsage of that Prince; And, in One Word, mysteriously contracts The Historie of His succeeding Acts. Go therefore, quickly from all Quarters cite The rarest Vertues, and most requisite For Royall bosomes, that did ever rest Within the Closet of a Kingly brest. Tell them, it is Our pleasure and Decree, That to This Prince they All God-mothers bee: And Shee among them that is found most fit, And best behoues in Crowned soules to sit, Shall at the Font, her sacred Name impose; And from thence-forth inspire him, as he growes, With all her Powers, to correspond the scope And full Extent of that great Empires Hope, Whose Limits yet vnlimited appear, Where Sire and Son to me are equall dear. I see th'Ægean streams, and Thracian strand, Already trembling vnder his Command: And th'horned Crescent (which hath scornd to vale) Before the Beams of This new Sun growes pale. To greatest Ships (as Guides of all the Fleet) The cunning'st Pilots evermore are meet: Mine, most Immediate, seems the soverain care Of Soverain Kings (who but My Subiect are); And therefore, I, that haue behight This Lad An ampler Rule then ever Monarch had, As, of the World to make him Emperour, I'll haue his Vertues equall to his Power: I'll make them so: and to approue it, all The Earths foure Corners I to witness call. This publisht thus: eft-soons the winged Posts Addresse them quick to these inferiour Coasts: And (swift as Arrow) hee that took to finde Faire Andria, or great and goodly minde, Among the many Idols of our Dayes That counterfeit her fashion and her phraze, Spy'd her at last, for her heer slight account, Ready to leaue vs, and aboue to mount A winged horse, in hope else-where to get A new Renowne, 'mid stranger Nations yet. Her Helmet (ever as her head she stirs) Seemed to twinkle with a thousand Stars: A stately groue of azure Plumes did wave, And proudly shadowed her gilt Armour brave: The bright keen Blade that by her side she wore, Inur'd to blood in Battails long before, As it were, weary of that rusting rest, And greedy longing for his wonted feast, Seem'd malcontent, and his proud Sheath disdaind (The golden Prison that him still detaind) Whereon were grav'n (with Arts Art-passing strife) By such a hand as could giue Metall life, The noblest feats of Valour (most extold) In later Times, and in the Dayes of old, Of greatest Monarchs that yet ever were, Whose marks the World (vnto this day) doth beare. There, by the Banks of Granic dy'd in graine As then: no Banks, but rather Hils of Slaine) Philips Great Son (in spite of multitude) To his sole Scepter the whole World subdewd. There, valiant Cæsar (Rome's first Emperour) Quashing the Senats and the Peoples power, And stooping all their Lawes to his Sword's Law, Tramples the Tropheis of his Son in Law; Who pale without, and all appall'd within, Flyes from Pharsalia, and his Hoast, vnseen. Why flyes Great Pompey? so (at once) to lose Th'Honors so oft wonn from so many foes? Because Thine fainted, must Thou faulter too? O yes! with Cæsar thou hadst heer to doo. There's thy Excuse: and though Thou lost the Game, Thy Victor yet some-what abates Thy Shame. There (on the Chape of massie gold, vnmixt With other Metall plain or wrought, betwixt) Our owne, Great Henry, smear'd with blood and dust, Pursues th'Iberians with keen fauchin iust; And iustly keening his courageous sp'rite Against those daring Demi-Moors despite, Beats out of breath the bravest of their Troupe; Who, bleak for fear, begin to faint and droupe: The gold, there loose, seems even to fly and (more) Looks pale in faces full of pride before. But Hee (well marked by his wilk-white Plume) With Kingly scorne, disdaigning th'odious fume Of vulgar blood, in valiant fury runns Vpon the proud Commanders Dukes and Donns, Who (either proud of Port, or rich Attire) Had by his hand a sudden death for hire. Their royall Patterne all his Troops take-after, And of the rest they make a glorious Slaughter: Whence streams of gore that to their Center scud, Met in a Ruby, make a Lake of Blood. Such costly Sheath sheath'd in such workmanship The sheen keen Blade on Valour's brawnie hip Hung in an azure Scarf, all ouer-sow'n With Crowned-Swords, and Scepters ouer-throw'n.) A thousand other famous Battails, fought At sundry times, with Cunning-cost were wrought Within her Crimsin Bases, waving lowe About her Calues, in Buskins white as snowe. Shee seem'd like Pallas, 'gainst the Giants prest; Or (on Mount Ida) against Mars addrest. At sudden sight of Heav'ns bright Messenger, In mylder port she straight composed her; And when He briefly to her heedfull thought Had done the sacred Arrand that he brought, And (by the way) had question'd her (beside) Whither her Haste was bent, she thus replyde: Cœlestiall Herald, While th'Heroick Prince, Whose gentle Yoak his Celticks so contents, Carv'd with his Sword a Statue to my Name, To stand triumphant in the House of Fame, Nothing could hold me from his steps, a-part; My hand did guide his hand, my hart his hart: Yea, I was with him, nay, within him, prest, His spirit's familiar, and perpetuall guest. But sithens Peace Him now hath quite disarm'd, And keepeth Mars within her Temple charm'd; I did giue way to my keen Swords Request, (Which can no longer lie and rust in Rest) And, while his heart, now all in loue with Peace, Hath left His hand, for me, no business, I meant to seek some other Strand for Stage To act my Wonders, in Warres dreadfull rage; That in brave Battails I againe might reap The Palms He wonted on my head to heap. For, with the sparkles of my glorious fire, Th'incensed brests of Younglings to inspire, I can no more finde in my heart; sith they So rashly rush to cast themselues away, So oft, for Trifles (bred of idle breath) So madly run to an vntimely death; So daily sacrifie their Life and Soule, In some so foolish Quarrels, som so foule, That, in the issue (fatall for the most) The Victors self may rather blush then boast; And such, as for such to vsurp the Sword (Besides the Conquest's euen to be deplor'd) Is nothing else but to profane the same, And to blaspheme mine honor and my Name. Not that I blame (where Blood and Nature bindes) In point of Honor (Idol of brave mindes) A Cavalier, so sensible of wrongs, To hazard Life and all that him belongs; Sith, voide of Honour, he is voide of sense, That holdes not Life a deadly Pestilence. But I would haue them rightly learne before (Not, of a heart meer valiant and no more; But, of a heart valiant at-once and wise) Wherein that Point of precious Honour lyes, For which, hee's happy that his Life shall lose; And cursed hee that care-less it forgoes. For, such a cup-fume over-flowes the brain Of such whose Soules this Error entertain, That One will ween his Honour interess't To bear a Word, though spoken but in jest; Who never thinks it tainted with a Ly, Nor toucht with base and wilfull Perjury: Nor with his Treason, when for som pretense Hee hath betraid his Countrey or his Prince, Or yeelded-vp som vn-distressed Place, Or fled the first to save a Cowards case. So th'Hypocrite, through Superstitious Error, Thinks hee hath don som Sin of hainous horror, When, by mis-heed, or by mis-hap, hee coms Vn-hallow-washt, into the Sacred Rooms; Yet, makes no Conscience, yet hath no Remorse To have vndon, or don to death, by force Of vn-just Doom, or fraud of Evidence, A many poor and harm-less Innocents: Nay, laughs at Widows and at Orphans tears, By his deceit, dispoild of all was theirs. Those valiant Romans, Victors of all Lands, They plaç't not Honour there where now it stands; Nor thought it lay, in making of the Sword Interpreter of every private word; Nor stood vpon Puntillios, for Repute, As now-adaies your Duellers pursue 't. But from their Cradle, train'd in Rules more fit, They neither knew th'abuse nor vse (as yet) Of Chalenges, Appells, and Seconds-aid. But, when the Lawes their Bridle loose had laid, For Publike Glory 'gainst a Publike Foe, There Honors point, there Valors proof to showe. But, when behoov'd, bravely and first to front An Armies force, or bear their sudden Brunt; Or, larded thick with darts, victorious, dy Vpon a Breach, or on a Rampire high; Or, leap alive into a yawning Hell, To save their City from Infection fell; Liv'd never Men that lesser feared death, More-daring Valor never yet had breath. Witnes (vnto this day) th'vndaunted harts In Curtius, Decius, and Horatius Parts: With many Worthies more, Immortaliz'd, Which, for their Countries have Selves sacrifiz'd; And whose brave deeds, whose honours, whose deserts, Move more Despair then Envy in Mens harts: For, dying so, Garlands and glorious Verse, Not Cries and Tears, honour'd their happy Herse; Their Flower of Fame shall never, never shed, Because their Death, their Country profited: Whereas the death which brings now brain-sick Youth Vnto their Grave, deserves but Tears and Ruth; Their Courage casts them even away, for nought; Without Memoriall, save a Mournfull Thought, Which, banning but the fury that inflam'd-them, Honours enough, if that it have not blam'd-them. O what a number of Courageous Knights, Abortively, have in These Single Fights Lost the fair Hope the World conceiv'd of them, Have idlely frustred, of their Valours gem, Their gratious Prince, who justly might expect, Against his Foes, their forward Worths effect; And, sacrilegious, to their Wrath have given And heady Rage (whereby they have been driven) The Sacrifice, which (with more sacred zeal) They ought to God, their King, their Common-weal! Ynow to make (could they return from death, Such as they were, when heer they lost their breath) Not a sole Squadron, but an Hoast of Men Whose Acts alone would furnish every Pen; An Hoast of Hectors, and Achilleses, Cæsars and Scipios, who, by Land and Seas, Following Great Henry for their Generall, Mought (if hee would) have made him Lord of ALL. Where, now, they ly in an inglorious Toomb, Longing for Light vntill the Day of Doom: Or lower, in eternall Dungeons dwell, With Ghosts and Shadows skirmishing in Hell. This mischief therefore, springing day by day, And spreading so, as nought his course can stay; And seeing (too) mine Honour blurr'd with blame, When these rash Mad-caps doo vsurp my Name; To bee, from hence-forth, from the Rage exempt Of such as turn my glory to contempt, And thus deface my Vertues grace with Vice, I hop't else-where some holier Exercise; And rather would, hearts so intemperous Should not enjoy mee, then imploy mee thus. Heer Andria ceast: The Angell, gracefully, Humours her Anger with this milde Reply: Certes, fair Nymph, your Plaint hath Right and Truth; But yet, excuse the boiling heat of Youth; Perhaps, 't is harder then you ween (precise) To bee at-once a French-man, Yong, and Wise. This Evill from This in-born Errour springs, That a Brave Minde, when wrong'd in any things Hee weens himself (if so hee Armes profess) Must no-where seek, but in his Sword, redress: And that an Eye, a No, a Nod, a Nick, 'S enough t'offend a Noble sense and quick. Pernicious Error, which dooth vndermine Both Martiall Thrones, and Civill, and Divine! For, to no end the Publike Sword shall serve, If every man may with his Private carve. And then, in vain are Soverain Princes Lawes, When Subjects dare Themselves decide their Cause. But I beleeve, This Madnes will no more Præcipitate their courage, as before. The curb of Law, which by their prudent Prince Is now new made against This Insolence, Will bar their bouldnes, and (directing mean How (This dear Honour saved whole and clean) A gallant Spirit, wrongd in any kinde, May lawfully his Satisfaction finde) Will binde their hands, and even glue-in their blades, Till, when som Foe their Common Right invades, In forward Zeal of their dear Countries good, It shall bee honour (even) to dive in blood. Disposed therefore to expect Amends, Dispatch the Order which Heav'ns Monarch sends; And goe not hence, where thou art so renown'd, Till all the world bee but This Empires bound: Were it for nothing but That Rising Sun, Whereon all Eyes already have begun (Both Friends and Foes) to fix their Hopes and Fears, That brave Yong Prince, who from his cradle bears Thine Image in his eyes, and in his arms, Thine Exercise in every kinde of Arms. Surely, said Andria, 't had been hard to finde A stronger Charm heer to arrest my minde Chiefly, heer living my Soules Sympathy, His Father; rather, that same other I): For, as in th'one I am a Miracle, So will I bee a match-less Spectacle In th'other too, when to his Ancient Right His daring Sword shall make his Claim by Fight; Whether his Armies royall-Front aspire Those craggy Hills whose Name is tane from Fire; Or tend vnto those fruitfull Plains which spred Toward Böotes, and Hyperions Bed, Whose Princes, in their Fables Antique-fram'd, Counts among Kings, Kings among Counts are nam'd. After these words, pronounç't with voice and gest, As Oracles are wont to bee exprest, Both took their flight through the thin crystall Air, Towards the Place appointed for Repair Of all the rest of Royall Vertues Band, Which were convented by Heav'ns high Command. Royall Eumenia was already come, And simple-mannerd Pistia (thought by som Long-since exiled from the World); and Shee Who from afar doth all Events fore-see. There was (apparant by illustrious things) Fair Euergesia, Ornament of Kings, And firm Hypomonè, with her Twin-sister Carteria, and Shee whose Patrone and Assister Are often shent, Alethia, little known To mortall men (no, scarce among her owne) With vails and cloaks they doo be-cloud her so, Whose spotless Self should rather naked go. In brief, of all the Vertues summon'd heer, There wanted none but Dicea to appear, And S?. Eusebia, in her Shadowes hid, That long it was yer Her the Angell spid. For, heer among vs a queint Idol haunts, Whose simple habite, whose sad countenance, Whose lowely look, whose language mildely-meek, Whose zeal-like gestures, and whose postures like, So counterfeit Her, with the Mask it makes, That many times the wisest it mistakes. You'ld think, her heart had onely God for Ioy, Her Exercise onely to fast and pray; That shee abhors the World; and, lodg'd therein, Lives as the Fish that out of water bin; That burning Zeal of Heav'n consumes her so, That all seems bitter that shee tastes belowe. Yet all the while, This hollow Holy-Tricks Doats but of Honours, dreams of Bishopricks, Thirsts for Promotion, thrusts for Primacy, Hunts glory still, yet seems it to defy, Never does good but for som great applause, Nor ever did good, for meer Goodnes cause. This Baen of Soules, and that same Foppery (Of old) sirnamed Dysidaimonie, Whose heart, deject with Terrors over-strong, To fear God's Iustice, doth his Mercy wrong (Right Servile Fear, with Errors foolifi'd) Have driven Eusebia hence, else-where to bide; Because th'one loves not, th'other mis-beloves What best to fear, and least presume behoves. The Angell therefore ferrets every nook, And narrowly her wonted haunts doth look, In every Cloister, and in every Cell, Where Folk beleev'd that Shee did ever dwell: Yet nothing findes hee of her, any-where, Save som old track or footing heer and there; No, though hee visite the austerities Of famous Abbeies and fair Nunneries: But, in Her stead, hee meeteth evermore One of These Hags in every Covent Door, Drest in a habite of so humble showe, That hard it was the difference to knowe. Yet, at the last, prying on every side, Her (as conceal'd) in a by-place hee spi'd, Where, with incessant tears, shee staid to rew And to bewail our Errours old and new; Amid an humble Troop, whom like Desire To loath the World, and from it to retire, Had made preferre a poor and mean estate, Yea Want it self, in place so separate, Before the Wealth, the Honours and Delights, Wherewith the World inveigles, as invites: As choosing rather heer to lose all These, Then lose thereby their Soules eternall Ease. In this sequestred place, prostrate in Praier (Best Antidote 'gainst Hopes pride and Despair; The Two grand Poisons of Soules Faculties) The Angell found Eusebia on her knees. Their Talk was short, the Time importun'd so: In brief therefore hee doth his Message showe, Acquaints her quickly Whence, and Why he came. Then She eftsoones consenting to the same, Away they post in a swift Aierie Coach Towards the place where all the rest approach, The generall Rendez-vous for all This Act: Where yet (alas!) the Ladie Dicea lackt. For, th'Angell, tasked to goe seek her forth, Sees her no more conuersing on the Earth, Nor findes her sitting (as she wont of-old) On Princes Thrones, and Prelats, vncontrould; Nor among Magistrates, which are the Tongue And Life of Lawe, t'interpret Right and Wrong. Where-at amazed, and desiring more To sound what reason Men could yield therefore, Assumes a Bodie, bearing in his hands A bagg of Writings and seem-Deeds for Lands: Comes to a Hall, all full of Murmuring Of people pricked with the angrie sting Of fel Eridea, who her Venome sheds Euen into Boores and Paisants harts and heads, By Her keen furie (as with Brizes) stung; And by Merimne and Dapania wrung: In This great Hall, vnknow'n vnto Repose, Stalks that stern Furie, either among those Of her owne Frye, or 'mong the wretched Crew Whom Her hard Gripes had made (in vain) to rew. A Rank of Seats, each vnto other fixt, And euery-one a sundrie Name affixt, Bordred the VValls, smoakie with age, and foule; Perches of manie plumie-pownced Fowle, Whose nimble Quills haue learnd to flye for that Rich Minerall, which makes men peace and prate. There was no Order: a lowd-buzzing Presse With whirling Eddies hurry'd without cease, Full of all Sorts; of Priests, of Gentlemen, Merchants, Mechaniks, Grooms and Husbandmen: Each iustled other, crowding to and fro, As heer and there the stream did ebb and flowe. This yauld, that brauld, another beat the Barr; One woo'd the Iudge, another vrg'd him farr; This proues Default, That pleads a Warrantie; This auoides Witnes; That, appeals more high; Another, fleering dooth his Aduerse flowte. With Rod in hand the Vshers trudge about: A world of Lawyers swarm'd; yet some had leasure (As least imploy'd) the Places length to measure. All boyld with Discords; one no sooner don, But instantly another New begun; With such a Noise as soundeth neer the Shoare When towards a Storm, the Sea beginns to roare. Hard-by this Ocean, which Night onlie stilld, Appeerd an Old-man (as one deeplie illd, And inly galled for some grieuous Losse) With eyes lift-vp, pale cheeks, and armes acrosse; Whom th'Angell spying, towards him he speeds: And (seeming Mortall by his Shape and weeds) Good Father, sayd hee (so to sound his minde) Where might I (think you) Lady Dicea finde, Whom I haue sought alredy far and neer, And surely thought now to haue found her heer? Dicea, my sonne, said the Old-man (well-nigh Gushing out Teares which stood in either eye; And sending forth a deep-fet Sigh, before) Dicea, alas! is in the VVorld no more. That Fire which only Death hath power to quench, That fel Desire no Deluge else can stanch; The burning Thirst of Worldly Goods and Gold, And all Sinns, taught to warre against her, bold, Haue forç't her to forsake this wretched Frame, And fly again to Heauen whence first she came. Or, if in Earth she yet have anie Stance, 'Tis with the Cinois, Turkes, or Scythians: But in This Climat hardlie dooth appeer Anie small signe, to showe she hath bin heer. Cruell Adicea in her Roome is sett: Hate, Fauour, Fraude, and Madame Counterfait (Out of all Courts hunting all Conscience quight) Make of Right Crooked, and of Crooked Right. Art and Deceipt keep there their open Schooles: Reason and Lawe are but the phraze of Fooles. For, Law and Reason are now waigh'd (by Sleight) In golden Scales; where, only Gold is waight. Thus, the Old-man proceeding still complaind; Till th'Angell, thus his Blasphemies restraind: Alas! good Father, your fresh Grief (I see) For some great Suite, late lost vnhappily, From your sad lipps this bitter language drawes; Excusable (perhaps) for your Grief's Cause: But th'eye of Passion ill discernes the truth. This hauing spoken; the Celestiall youth Turns to another, lesse disturb'd in minde; And likewise askes, Where he might Dicea finde. Hee, more discreet, and milder-spoken, farr, Replyes: My Sonne, sure verie few there are (Yea of the wisest, who best vnderstand) That easily can answer thy demand. For One perhaps will think her to be there; Whereas, another (seeming wrongd) will swear By Heau'n, and all that in it Heau'n containes, That not a spark nor mark of her remaines: Each holding her, present or absent, still As his owne Cause hath thryued well or ill. But I'll assure thee (and past all Appeal) That in this Place shee dooth not alwayes dwell. Sometimes shee comes, and brings for Companie, Honor, and Faith, and old Integritie: But the strange Tricks of a bold babbling Dame Call'd Quiddi-quirk, as barbarous as her Name, Molest her so, that soon they driue her hence; For, Both at-once haue no-where Residence: And Plutus too, her many-times dismaies; With that sweet Power whereby the world he swaies, Causing her oft return with heauie cheer: And that's the Cause she stayes so seldom heer. Oft haue I seen her on the souverain Seat In that high Senate, whose Edicts compleat Sway all the Kingdome; and (if anie-where) I sure belieue, you yet shall find her There, If those Abuses whose bold Tyrannie From other Thrones hath driuen her openly, Haue not crept-in by some close Golden Port: But, far bee That from such a reuerend Court. Heer ceased Hee: and instantly, withall Losing his sight, the Angell leaues the Hall; His aierie Bodie to the Aier repayes. And while he takes to other Courts his wayes, Hee happily the wished Lady meets: Who, inly ioyd (which outward gesture sweets) Because in Iudgement shee had ouerthrow'n Wrongs proud Support, and giuen poor Right his own, Came from deciding of a Cause of waight, Before the Peers and Councel of Estate. But, her Content was doubled when she heard Heav'ns sacred will (as th'Angell had auerrd) And His high pleasure (whose Omnipotence The Heav'ns adore) for Surname of the Prince: With him therefore Her speedie she directs Towards the Troupe which only her expects. Now all these Nymphs assembled seemed prest (All diversly with Ioy and Hope possest) To take their Flight to that King-fauourd Place Where (pre-ordained for this VVork of grace) They should impose the Royall Infants Name, The Worlds main Hope (as most conceiue the same) When soudainly there did among them breed A noble strife, which stayd their forward speed; Though great desire to see the radiance Of that young Sunne which should enlighten France, Hasted their haste: and though on euerie side As well the sacred Pomp as ciuill Pride, The King himselfe, Princes and Princely Dames Glittring in gold, sparkling in pretious Flames, And all the Court adornd in-rich Array, Seem as offended at the least Delay. But yet, because Heauens Monarch had decreed, That of the Vertues Shee which should exceed, As most conducing to Kings happie state, Should with her Name this Princeling nominate; When one of those high Heralds vrg'd them on, Among themselues This to consult vpon, Consult? said Andria: Why consult about A Point, whereof (I think) was neuer doubt? Mine, Mine's this Honour: for, among vs all, Who more adorns a Kings Memoriall, Or better keeps a Sceptres Majesty At his full Height in Royall hands, then I? I fill his Name with Glory and Renown: I make him fear'd abroad of every Crown: I, with the terror of his Arms, deterr Ambitious Tyrants that they dare not stir Offensive War against Himself or His, How ever spurd by Spite or Avarice; His famous Valour gaining This, for Meed, That at the last hee seems it not to need: Vnlesse hee list his Conquests to extend Throughout the World; then is it I that bend The proudest Mountains vnder his Command, The strongest Holds I render to his hand: I fill with fear, I chill with trembling Ice, The boldest hearts of oldest Companies That dare resist his quick and thick Alarms, With th'onely lustre of his glittering Arms. I often onely with his Trumpets sound (Without a stroak) his Enemies confound; And, dreadfull, make the most redoubted heer Think it no shame to flee his fierce Career, As if (no Steel, of proof to ward his blowes) 'T were Rashnes more then Valour to oppose. Such were of-old those hardy Heroes found, For Prowess, Then for Demi-gods renown'd: Such, Hee whose shoulders shor'd Olympus walls: Such, Hee who conquer'd th'Empire of the Gaules: Such, that Great Macedon: and such (again) Those famous Paladines, whose Fables vain (Yet vse-full Tales) th'old Romants fain so fit, That even they seem by Morpheus fingers writ. But what they had Ideally from Art, That Really I to a Prince impart. Who knowes not, that I, onely vs'd in Field, Serve all the Vertues both for Sword and Shield? Your Selves indeed seem to agnize no less, Although in words you shame it to confess. For, when the fury of Wars dreadfull Stowrs Begins to thunder neer Your dainty Bowrs, All pale for Fear, all trembling, all dismaid, To Mee yee flee, to Mee yee cry for Aid; Vnder my wings yee creep to keep you sure: Where (and but there) you think your selves secure. And, rather I, then Any (who expose My Self alone against the Hail of Blowes) Begin Estates, beget, and bring them forth, And plant (in blood) the Empires of the Earth. Th'admired height of Romes great Scepter yerst (As that of Greece) was but My work, at first; And that same Other famous, glorious Throne, Whose Greatnes, Yet, doth in its Cinders grone. For, though by War, with Fire and Sword, I waste What Heav'ns Decree hath doom'd to bee defaç't; Even while I raze, I raise; and, of the Rubble Of petty States, I build One hundred double: As horrid Dragons growe so hugely great Of many Serpents that alive they eat. You are indeed extold (and worthily) For knowing well, to vse a Victory: But, without Mee, You can have none to vse; Without Mee then, your Knowledge nought accrues. Therefore, your Honour's less; at least, 't is such As (at the best) on Mine dependeth much. In brief, in all the sacred Works wee doo, Our Merit's diverse, and our Honour too: You rule the humble, I the proudest tame: You adorn Kingdoms, and I conquer them: You can direct, and I protect, a Crown: You doo besiege, I dare assault, a Town: You shew the vtmost of Mans Wit and Art, I act your aims with valiant hand and heart: You (lastly) plot, in shady Chambers siel'd, What I perform, abroad, in bloody Field. But, in all These, I pass you All, as far, As to subdue the stoutest Foes in War; To see about one (Lightning-like) to flash Millions of Shot, Millions of Swords to clash; To hear no noise but Canons roaring Thunder, Divorcing Soules from Bodies pasht in sunder; To march in blood even to the Knees; and yet In all vndaunted, not dismaid awhit, Is both more painfull and more Princely too, Then clearing of a cloudy Fraud, or two; To shield by counsell Equity opprest; To gain the Fame of Wisdom with the best; To fast and pray, or give abundantly, Or get the name of gracious Clemency. Then well fare Valour: and, long live the Story Of valiant Princes in the Fane of Glory: No humane Vertue hides, so well as I, Obnoxious stains when Princes step awry; An Alexander, Aristides seems, Because the splendor of my spreading beams With radiant lustre dazles so the sight, That nought is seen but Great and glorious Light. Where, if hee lack my Raies, or my Renown; Boast hee of double or of trebble Crown, Bee hee benign, bee hee munificent, Iust, wise, religious, learned, eloquent, Precise of Promise (both to Friend and Foe) Princes abroad little regard him though; Yea, might hee justly all (else) Vertues vaunt; Yet, wanting mee, hee seemeth all to want. His Hare-like heart at Wars least noise doth quake, And to his Beads hee doth him all betake: His Fear strikes Fear in his best Refuges, And his no-courage doth discourage His. In brief, as blest with Peacefull Vertues rare, Hee seems far fitter (in a time of War) With Keies and Crosiers, a Pope's Part to play, Then Sword and Sceptre, as a King, to sway. As Andria had ended heer her Part; Shee, in whose School wee learn the heedfull Art Of never fondly Vndertaking ought; Soft, soft, said shee: To boast our selves, wee ought Not blame our Equals; nor (with proud Exchange) To our own Praises their Dispraises change: Andria, I grant, Thy merit's great; but Mine Is, if not greater, full as great as Thine; Sithens, to raign in Soule of Maiesty, There is no Vertue to bee matcht with Mee. For, let a King bee full of High-deseigns, Let him bee Valiant, as your Paladines; Let him bee gracious, just, and liberall, True of his word, and so devout withall, That at his Feet all Vices prostrate ly; If Mee hee lack, that am all Vertues Ey, Blindefold hee vses (nay, well-neer abuses) These divine Gifts, which bountious Heav'n infuses: And right resembles a fair Ship, for Sea All ready rigd, and furnisht every way With every Needfull; Men, Munition, Beef, Beer, Biscuit, all: onely shee wants (the Chief, The Life and Soule, the Sense, the Lawe, the Light Whereby shee lives, moves, stirs, and steers aright) A skilfull Pilot, with Discretions hand Her winged Manedge rightly to command With hempen Rains, and wooden Bridle, so, That never wry shee sail, nor wrong shee rowe: Without whose guidance, if the puffing gales Into the Deep transport her huffing sails, Shee runs at random, and with ruefull Knock Soon splits her self vpon som Shelf or Rock. Even so it fares with Princes, when they make Or Peace, or War, and not My Counsell take; Or, without Mee, as it were blindefold, vse Their other Gifts the gracious Heav'ns infuse? They thrive so little, that (as in a Wrack) Their owne rich Burden often breaks their back. Their forward Valour but sad Fruit doth yield; They win the Victory, yet lose the Field; They bravely fight, and yet' are bravely foil'd: Som Error still hath all their Actions spoil'd. Their Bounty bindes not, but vnbindeth, hearts: Their Clemency, much more then Rigor, smarts: Their Zeal it self prooves to themselves pernicious; And, vnto others, blinde and superstitious: Their Vice and Vertues them so inter-nex, That scarce can one distinguish their Effects. Not that Ill still is not Good's Opposite; But that, They, wanting Mee, their onely Light, Doo (even) Good evill; or doo, out of season, A Good, which is not good, done without Reason; And, of fair Vertues, fruitfull Seeds of Glory, Reap blasted Buds, which stain their goodly Story. What famous Conquest ever yet was got, Which to the Victor I prepared not? Thou fightest bravely, and in Victories Of bloody blades, getst the first Crown, for prize: But I, by th'art of Providence, dispose To glorious issue thy courageous blowes. I wisely take the fit advantages Of Time and Place, to second Courages: I skilfully the Squadrons range and rank; I marshall them to shew their Front or Flank As best befits (by warlike Stratagem) T'inclose their Foes, to clip, or curtall them; Or, brest to brest (as angry Lions wont) With brave incounter, charge them full afront: I, by an Ambush, laid with lucky speed, Opprest with number, help thee at thy need: I many times prevent thy like mis-hap, When seem-flee Foes would train thee to the trap: I, to bee brief, with ever watchfull brain Assist, to make thy Valour never vain. But, if a Prince must needs want one of vs, And mought not bee both Wise and Valourous; Sure, Reason would our glorious parts assigne; Thine, to brave Souldiers; to great Captains, Mine; Because, my Powers are proper to Command, As Thine to Execute with hardie hand. But though our humors so farre diuers be, Yet may wee Both, in one braue Spirit, agree: And, for This Age, wee need no Witnes els But famous Henry, who in both excells; With so great Wisedome ruling on the Throne Which with such Valour hee hath made his owne: His victories, yet, making Men dispute, To which of Vs, they should them best impute. Yet hundred Laurells neuer widow-curst, And hundred Ovals, which no skin haue burst, Proue I haue often Conquer'd without Thee: But neuer wert Thou Victor without Mee. For, I haue oft seene Armies dissiped, And proud, strong Cities often rendered, (Well mur'd, well manned, &amp; well stor'd with food) Without the spilling of a drop of blood; Vsing no other then the ancient Wile Of wasting fields; where Publique losse (the while) Returnd This Gaine, to stoope by Famine Those Which could not else haue been subdu'd dy Blowes. Besides th'off-cutting of all Passages, As well of Succours, as of Forrages; Is euen to conquer by vncasuall course, Fight-lesse to fight, and without force to force. Great Captaines therefore did Vs neuer part: Sith either, sole, is as a head-lesse Dart; Or (if not head-lesse) heed-lesse thrown (as ill) From feeble Caster, without aime, or skill. 'Tis said of Pallas, in the Troiane Broyle, That Shee in fight stern Mars himselfe did foyle; To showe how farre Wise-Valour doth excell A rash Excesse of Courage boiling fell; Whose fume-blind force, wanting Discretions beam, Resembless right a sightless Polyphem. But, whether ioynt or seuerd be our Powers, My Cunning still yields fairer fruits and flowers, Then doth Thy Violence (though oft it spread Bright vertuous rayes about Thy glorious head). For, onely then are Thy stiffe armes imploid, When stubborn War dares to haue all destroid. But, when sweet Peace fills Crownes with Coronets, Thou art lockt vp in Princes Cabinets; Among the Corselets, which, now wariefied Through loue of Peace, they haue new layd aside; Or those, which idlely (through Times alteration) Hang by the Walls, both out of Vse and Fashion. But I, indifferent, serue in War and Peace; I breed her, feed her, and her yeeres increase, By prudent Counsails, prouident Decrees, Kind turns, calme Treaties (fitting all degrees); In briefe, by all means meet to render Kings Mutually friends; and rule their Vnderlings: Whence to their States if happy fruits accrew, Th'honour of all to Mec alone is due. But, in the World, what State hath euer thriuen; Or rather, which hath not to Wrack been driuen, Where lackt My Conduct, and where onely Chance Hath steerd the course of Publique Gouernance? What humane Action, what Design, what Thought, Without Mine aide hath euer com'n to ought? What Priuat stock, what Publique stem of Blood, Without my Rules hath sprung, or long hath stood? All noblest Arts, all nimblest Works of worth, Which humane brains conceiue, and hands bring forth, Hold they not Mee for rich and fruitfull Wombe, From whence their births (both first and second) come? The kindest Counsailes, without Mine among, May wee not call them Treasons of the Tongue, When blind and bad Aduice (though malice-less) Ruins the Friend to whom it meant Redress? Nay nothing, nothing vnder Heav'n, may misse The Minds-guide rayes of my Resplendencies: I am the true Sun of all humane acts; Without Mee, Fortune all their praise exacts. If ought I leaue to Fortunes doubtfull deed. It shall appeare well set, though ill succeed: But where My Sceptre hath a soueraine sway, Fortunes false Die hath little power to play. Then, bee't on Cedar, with a Pen of Gold, For Memorie and Glorie too inrold, That Of all Soule-adorning Gifts diuine, The Maiestie, the Monarchie is Mine: That I, Their Queene, life of Their lawes and spring, Am, of all Vertves worthiest of a King. To whom, I seem so much more requisite (Being both his Guide and Eye to giue him Light) As hath a Guide (so iudge the most discreet) More need of Eyes, then either hands or feet. Heere ceast Phronesia: Andria instantly, Weening her wrong'd, seemes willing to reply, And to her Selfe already soft shee sayes, Shee hath lesse skill in Phrases then in Frayes; But, to maintaine the honour of her Cause, VVhere need requires, not words but swords she draws. Then S?. Eusebia, joyntly raising fair Her Soules pure Zeal, and her sweet Voices air, See, see, said Shee, how proudly insolent, Vain Men, admiring and too confident Of Their fond Wisdom, and frail Fortitude (Forgetting Heav'ns quick Ey and Arm) conclude, That their owne strength, or their owne providence, Hath foil'd their foes, or given their owne defence: As silly children (set on fourm or stool) Whose hands are (first) held at the Writing-School, Forming som Letter, vaunt it for their Owne, And think their Art-less fingers skilfull growne. But, O fond Mortalls! Neither is 't your Art Of mystike State, nor your high hand and hart, Which in your Borders Peace and Plenty brings, Or ends your Battells in your Triumphings: But Heav'ns Right-hand, invisibly addrest To rescue You, hath death it self represt; Repell'd all Perils, put-by all Mis-haps (Ready to quell you with tempestuous claps): And then retorting all vpon your Foes, In lieu of Laurels (which They did propose) Sends Terrors, Errors, or Disorders rife, Or Mutinies, or other Civill strife, Or other Mischief, which confounds their powrs With their owne Swords, or makes them fall on yours: So that your hands, victorious Thus, doo bear Right glorious Palms, and Olives every where Adorn your Coasts with their rich oily tresse, And all with you is Victory or Peace. Yet you, ingrate the-while, through blinde Self-love, Not seeing, that these Gifts com from above, Sacrifice to your Selves, confer the honor Of all, to all, save to their owne right Owner. O cursed Soil! O barren Sand and dry! Not betterd ought by any husbandry; Hardned with Heav'nly deaws, the more the worse: More worthy nothing then a heavy Curse. O wretch! refer, refer aright, and bring These sacred Streams birth to their sacred Spring, That perfect Good, which can no more desist To doo thee good, then Thou Him to resist. Through all thy Province let his Name bee prais'd: If to a Crown his favour have thee rais'd, Rear Him an Altar in thy Soule anon; And, for Burnt-Offring, lay thy heart thereon: His powr (alone) adore, implore and trust; And in thy Self kill every kinde of lust: So shalt thou not, what-ever Hap succeed, Neither so much Courage nor Counsell need. For, covering thee with his protecting hand, Did all the World in Arms against thee band, Besiege thee round, assault thee in such sort, That nought could save thee; neither Force, nor Fort: Amid all dangers which might fright thee there, Hee, hee would free thee from all cause of fear; And Thine, preserv'd from death and deadly Foes, Would bee amaz'd to conquer without blowes. Thy Praiers would put a hundred Hoasts to flight, Had each a Cæsar to command them right: Yet, fighting on thy knees, with arms across, Thou, thou (alone) shouldst conquer, without loss. Again, His Angell would assume the Sword Wherewith somtimes th'Assyrian swarms hee gor'd; Again, Senacherib's braving Blasphemies Should finde a King, with water in his eyes, To vanquish him with vows: and, as with charms, Thou shouldst doo more with tears, then hee with Arms. Why then thus vainly dare Wee heer consult Of others Right, or of our Owne insult? Shee, shee that gives to God (nay, giveth God) On Her of right this Crown should bee bestow'd; Sith, her possessing, they All Good possess: But, wanting her, All else is emptiness. Let neither Prowess then, nor Prudence, ween Her Self Kings glory, neither Vertues Queen: I have seen Valiant Kings, and Prudent too, And such as knew in all turns what to doo, And such whose Constance was incomparable, Live wretchedly, and dy as miserable: Yet, never saw I but a happy End Of Pious Princes, which on God depend; And in all doubts, all dangers (from their Birth) Have (sacring vnto Heav'n the thoughts of Earth) With eyes ay-fixt on That Sunn's sunny side, Beleev'd his Love their Guard, his Lawe their Guide. Not that I would a Prince, secure and idle, Should so let-go his Empires Rains and Bridle; To cast on God the Cares, the Managings, And glorious labours that belong to Kings: Nay, rather would I, that with Vigilance, Constancy, Iustice, Wisdom, Valiance, And all else Vertues which his God hath giv'n, Hee second still th'assisting hand of Heav'n; Ay well assur'd, that God will not neglect Iust-armed Prayers of his owne Elect. But, to His onely Bountie must they giue Th'honor of all the fruits they shall atchieue By their most noble Cares, most Royall Paines: Not to the depth of Machiauilian Brains, Not to the vaine Effort of humane force, Nor Martiall Courage, mowing Men and Horse, Which in effect (how glorious Name it beare) Is but a Publique, (lawfull) Massacre. In briefe, what Worth, or Wit in King may bee, Heav'ns King commands he make Them wait on Mee: Make That, the Spur; Me, Raine of each Intent; This, of his Counsaile; Me, the President: Credit Them often, Me continually: That They inspire his Hart; his Iudgement, I. And, that in nothing They with Mee compare; Nor any else (how Royall) Vertues rare: But make Mee sit in Honors fourm the first; Yea, without Mee, esteeme his State accurst: Hold Them for helpefull, Mee for necessary: And firme belieue, when Times are aduersary, Rather to faile, with Prowes and Policy, Nay fall, with All; then flourish without Mee. Through such a Faith, that great King-Prophet yerst, With little force, so many Foes reverst: So oft escap't so many Snares of Death, Which Envies hand had set to stop his breath: So fortunate, in euerie ieopardie, Hee almost seemd t'haue wedded Victorie. What Monarch would not gladly be the Heire Of these high fortunes of His Vertues faire? Who would not purchase at the deerest rate Of all his Paines, the glorious Praise He gate? And yet, the Vertue which aduanç't Him so, And on his Acts such honors did bestow, Was not his Prowess (though he durst enough) Neither his Prudence (though of famous proofe); But his religious Pietie and Zeale To serue the Lord, the God of Israel: Zeale, which consuming Him with heauenly flame, Made him to consecrate his Facts, his Fame, Himselfe, his Sword, his Sceptre, and his Song, At the Authors feet, to whom they All belong: As still esteeming that hee held his Crown, By his support who had it first bestow'n; Not by the Prowess, or the Policy, Of his owne darefull hand, or carefull Eye. Let noblest Princes imitate this Part, This pious zeale of his religious hart: And let them know, that nor their Heed in sway, Nor their Good-hap (which seem's t'attend them ay) Their Knowledge, Courage, nor Victorious fame, About their heads so glorious Garlands frame, Neither from heav'n so many blessings bring, Neither so much doe magnifie a King, Nor dignifie the Sceptre in his hand So many millions iustly to command; As I, who, after this worlds Diadem, Find them a-new, in new Ierusalem: That God himselfe-vouchsafes to watch Their state, Becoms Their Counsaile, Their Confederate, Their Rock, their Refuge from their Enemies, And gets them daily glorious victories: That, without Mee, no Vertue is compleat; And that, in That which maketh truly Great, I passe the rest, and all the best They can, As farre as God in Greatnes passeth Man. Eusebia heer concluding her discourse, Dicea began her Title to enforce: I haue (said shee) long lent you eare a-like, Yet from your Reasons, and your Rhetorike I gather nothing, from the most of you, But Vsurpations of Mine honors due; While mine owne Noursling from my side you steale: Wherein, with Iustice you scarce iustly deale. For, if of Vertues any worthy bee To raign, as Kings eternall Companie; And with more lustre their great Names do grace, I, I am Shee may iustly claime that Place; As shee alone, who, by One duety, doo Make happy Kings, and happy Subiects too: Shee, that of all the Graces from aboue, Acquire them most their Peoples hate or loue: Shee that the Stock of Traytors doth extinguish, Shee that good Kings from Tyrants doth distinguish: Shee that to Each due Recompence imparts According to their good, or bad Deserts: Shee, without whom the rife-full strife-full sound Of Mine and Thine would all the World confound. Not that I am so inly blunt, or blind, As not to value Valours valiant mind; Or not to see, What Benefits to Kings Sacred Eusebia, and Phronesia brings: But sate Eusebia (whom I honour more Then all the Greatnes Worldlings most adore) Not one of you produceth her effects So fortunate and free from all defects, But often times some euill them succeeds Which equalls oft their Good, somtimes exceeds: Much like some Herbs, of doubtfull fame and force, Which cure one Griefe, and cause perhaps a worse. 'T's a glorious Work tryumphing worthily, To win by force a famous Victory, To flowre a field with dead, to swim in blood, To glasse ones Valor in a Crimsin flood: But, what's all This, but a meer Massacre Of furious Lions (not a humane War) Vnless the Right of the bright Sword victorious: Make the Cause iust, and the Effect as glorious? And are not those so bloody Palmes, (the while) Gathered in Countries, ruin'd with the spoile Of Wars dire fire, flaming on euery side Of those sad fields, forsaken far and wide? O bloudy Vertue, for Warre onely fit, And for the Mischiefes that do wait on it! Yet lest (alas!) her thirsty Steele should rust Within her Sheath, too-long restrained; must, Must men with Tears see their deer Countries spoil'd, Their fields with heaps of slaughtred bodies pyl'd, Their Cities sackt, their Houses all inflam'd, Their treasurs shar'd, their wiues and daughters sham'd, Their tender babes (which haue no helpe, but cryes) Brain'd, broached, broyl'd, in horrid Sacrifice? Sure, Noble Furie of heroick harts, The hideous Stage wheron thou act'st thy Parts, Is too-too-costly to a State; too-deer Are all thy Palms; thy Glory walks too-neer Deep Miseries, Pains, Perils, Dolors, Deaths, And dire Euents; which not alone the breaths Of Foes bereaue, and Forraine States vndoo; But wrack with all thine owne Domesticks too. For, what Effects, but such nefarious things, Haue been the fruits of thousand valiant Kings? Whose memories so ring of Battailes yet, That euen with bloud their Stories may be writ: Leauing their Names, iust Arguments of terror, Loading the Earth with Monuments of horror, Filling both Land and Sea, with Gore, with Gall, And, to no purpose, topsie-turning All: Sith all the gaine of all their Victories, Is but a fame of Valiant Robberies; Reproachfull praise to Souerain Potentates, To Supreme Pastors, to high Magistrates: Yet, most of These haue reapt no other fruit, From bloudy labors, but This odious Bruit: Whereas They should (only) their Powers imploy To salue, to saue; and neuer to destroy. One onely King (no further Name is need) Iustly constraind to arme, and mount his steed, By force to enter to his Own by Right; Hath sacred all his Art, his Hart, his Might, To's Empires good: and, chasing War away, Makes Peace approu'd his Valors daughter ay. The rest, still greedy of new Isles, new Indes, Haue raisd such storms with their Ambitious windes, As in their own Seas haue nigh sunk Themselues, And cast their Subiects vpon Rocks and Shelues, Where (through more woes) they, euen with tears, behold How ill it is to haue a King too Bold. Now, for your Prudent (but, meer Prudent) Kings, Too-much Discourse, which from their iudgment springs, Oft makes them timerous, loth to take-in-hand; To lose their time, while waiting Time they stand; And, daring nothing, but Discoursing still, To Erre as much as those that dared ill: Or, makes them, more (in Worldly matters, heer) Subtile and sharp, then loyall and sincere. So that as they of dangers heedfull are; Of Them, no lesse behoues it to beware. I will not not say, that many times the grounds, VVhereon the worlds blind, foolish wisdom founds, Are Contrarie vnto the solid Base Which heav'ns true wisdom euery where doth place. So that, one Thought neuer it selfe extends (Nor can) at once, to two so diuers Ends: No more then can the sight of mortall eyes In one same instant, Heav'n and Earth comprise. What shall I say of Thee (and doe thee right) Sweet S?. Eusebia, Gods own deere Delight? Thou fillest Kings, indu'd with Thy desires, With sacred feruour of Celestiall fires; Thou mak'st their Liues a liuely speaking Lawe, To rule their Subiects more by Loue then Awe; But yet, thou mak'st (if Thou alone be Theirs) Them too-too-slack in other Kingly Cares; Too-mew'd in Peace, in VVar too-scrupulous; And think so much of Heav'n, that Earth they lose. And, Euergésia, praising Thine Effects, Amid the best well may we doubt defects: For, what in Kings more Heav'n-like seems to all, Or God-like more, then to be liberal? Yea, liberal Princes seeme euen Gods on Earth, Com'n-down from Heav'n to hunt Despaire and Death, Care, Indigence, Incomber, and the rest, Where-with poore Vertue often is opprest. Yea, euen as Gods, Their Names are honord heer, And, for their Seruice nothing is too-deer. (The ground of which so great Beneuolence, In some, is Hope; in some, Experience): So that all Vowes, all Voices end in Them, And as the Sun, Their Sceptres brightly beam. Yet, oftentimes, those Bounties of thy hand Proue publique Burdens, bitter to a Land; VVhen fluent Princes (least their Fauors source Should be exhausted) haue too-oft recourse To Tributes, Imposts, and some worse withall; Whence Flowers to few, to many Thornes befall: And Avarice her selfe vniustly fills VVith what Profusion ouer-fondly spills. Nor thou, Eumenia, though extold so high As liuelest Type of Heauenly Clemencie, And onely Shield of such as dare infrenge My sacred Rules, to saue them from Reuenge: Thou canst not cleere thee from the confluence Of Euills vs'd to follow Indulgence. For, by too-sparing, Thou doost Vices spread; Thou losest sound, to saue corrupt and dead: And filling Cities with home-Enemies, Thy Pardons turn to publique Iniuries. But I, by practice of vnpartiall Rigor, Maintain good Orders, keep the Lawes in vigor: Make Kings at-once belou'd and feared too (Feared, alone of those that euill doo). Their Subiects (set on happy Plenties knee, In their possessions from Oppressions free) Blesse them, adore them, hold them (euer deer) Their Countries Fathers, nay their Gods wel-neer. In briefe, no Blessing can befall a Realm, But Theirs inioy, from, by, or vnder Them. For, as it is, of the Wilde-Ash-tree, said, That th'only sauour, nay the onely shade, Instantly kills (by strong Antipathie) What euer Serpents vnderneath it lye: Such, to the Snakes of Vice, those Princes are Which 'gainst Iniustice haue proclaimed VVar, With no lesse Care to make My Rules to raigne, Then their owne Scepters in their hands sustaine. Can no Rebellion spring at least, none speed In their Dominions, neither Factions breed; Sith gracious Heauens vouchsafe them this Accord, For hauing vs'd so equally My Sword (To all Degrees, in City, Field and Town) In Civill War they shall not wear their Owne. Their People, feeling in Their happy Sway, What Hap, what Rest, what Freedom they injoy, Deeming them as their gods, and meting (rife) Their length of Bliss by their dear length of Life, Watch for Their Safeties; and can suffer nought 'Gainst them to bee mis-don, mis-said, mis-thought; No more then 'gainst their Publique's Prospering, Whereof they hould Their Iustice onely Spring. For, of all rarest Vertues that may meet In a just Prince, They onely taste the sweet Of Mine Effects; and of that Equall Care Of not surcharging more then they may bear. What boots it that their Majesties bee meek, Magnanimous, frank, pious, politique, And of a spirit surpassing each Extreme? Misse they but Mee, They little reck of them: They love them not, they listen far and neer Som welcom news of their wisht death to hear: When, if they vse My sacred Exercises, Though they bee stain'd (perhaps) with other Vices, They hould them perfect; and, in spite of Fate, Even after death, their Names they celebrate; As living Reliques, still preserv'd above In Fames fair bosom, and their Peoples love. Witnes, vnto this day, that Norman Prince, Brave Rollo, still belov'd (though dead long since) Still cald vpon (as for His iust Revenge) When som new Wrong doth their old Right infrenge. Henceforth therefore, O Princes, that desire To have your Names to highest Fames aspire, To leave behinde you Monuments of Worth, To give your Glories, after death, new Birth; Endevour not to dazle proudest eyes With Towrs of Marble mounted to the skies; Neither by War (whose Train is Plague and Dearth) With fire and blood to mingle Heav'n and Earth; To thousand Perils to expose your lives, Whereby your Greatnes, not your Goodnes, thrives. Onely, love Mee; let Mee bee reverenç't Through all your lands, by all your hands defenç't: Let Mee sit by you on an Awfull Throne, To daunt the Leudest with my looks alone; And with my Sword still drawn to prune-away Luxuriant Twigs that break my iust Array: Let My Tribunals bee the Poors Refuges: Let thereon sit no mercenary Iudges: Let Innocence finde there her surest Fort; And who wants Right, there let him want Support: There let My Balance be impawn'd to none; But, as his Right is, let Each haue his Owne: In briefe, with You let Mee be set so high, That absolute as you doe Raigne, may I: And I shall more enrich your lasting Stories, Then all your golden Towers, your Conquering glories, Your precious Gifts that with full hand you giue, Or ought besides, whereby your Names can liue. Dicea as yet did her Discourse pursue (Though milde Eumenia, loth to lose her due, Loth longer to endure her Vaunts so high, With open mouth was ready to reply; And so her Sister Euergesia eek, Some little choler colouring her cheek) When from th'Empyreall (right Imperiall) Court, Came a new Nuntio with a new Report, A trustie Truch-man of supernall Pleas, Their gentle Iarres thus gently to appease. Immortall Beauties of past-humane Soules, He, that both Globes in his one hand-gripe holds, Dooes you to weet, that His high pleasure is (To quench for euer all your Differences) You All haue th'honour to impose the Name, To Whom he means such fauour and such Fame, PANARETVS (for an auspicious Signe Y'haue markt him All with all your Types diuine) That, All transform'd into that reuerend Clark, Heav'ns hallowed Organ, for this sacred work; Eusebia, Thou (Whom Hee resembles best) Shalt Name the Child, in name of all the rest; After that He hath six times sounded tho That other Name his Nation fancies so. Hy, hy ye then: Time calls you; for the throng, These Rites expecting, thinks each minute long. And I, the while, with no lesse speed must spy Th'vnholsome Den where Pestilence doth ly, And in Heav'ns name, her straitly countermand, That Shee presume not once to lift her hand, Nor from her Quiuer shoote one Arrow out At any of the Royall Courtly Rout Assembled for the sacred Mysterie, During the Pomp of That Solemnity. Heer-with the Angell henc't, and bent his flight Tow'rds Our sad Citie, which then deeply sigh't Vnder the fury of that Monster fell. Hee found her out in a hot-humid Cell, About to Arm her, and to scout abroad, Euen towards the Place which now the Heav'ns forbode. Foule seam-rent rags (which som old Robe had bin) Cas't heer and there her yellow-sallow skin, Where-in hot fierie Carbuncles were fixt, With poisonie Rubies, heere and there betwixt: A quench-lesse Thirst, with a continuall Feauer, Broild in her brest, boild in her body euer; Her verie Breath was as a deadly stroak: Her cursed Stance ready with stink to choak: So close it was, that neuer Wind could fan, Saue the th'vnrefin'd autumnall Affrican, Whose noisome aire a stuffing fogge did pen With mustie Vapours of a moistie Fen. All round about her, by her side did ly All sorts of Fruits that soonest putrefie, Millions of Milions; Peares, Plums (passing numbers) Most-humor-poysoning, crudie-cold Cucumbers; Green Grapes; and that soft Persian fruit (so deer) Banefull at home, and little better heer. The Angel, wonted to Heav'ns Bliss-full Hall, Made little stay in this vnholsesom Stall: But, loathing soone that thick contagious aire, He speedily dispatcht his Message there; And Heav'n-ward quickly from the Furie flew, Whose horror yet so seemd him to pursue, That he had fainted to haue bin so nigh-her, Had he not felt him of th'immortall Quier. Th'immortall Sisters, in one troope, the while (Which from their Owners euery Vice exile) Transported swift vpon a winged Clowde, By their Arrivall made the Palace proude. The pompous Scaffold, for this purpose reard, Seemd at their sight to tremble (as afeard): The stately Towers of th'antique Edifice, The massie Porch, and Arch and Frontispice, Seem'd round about to lighten smiling flames, As at their Entrance to adore these Dames. They, shuffling them (vnseen) amid the throng Of those Good-Great, whom (as they past along) A soft sweet Murmur, for their Vertues, blest; Serued with Them (each in her office prest) That goodly Rising Sunne, whose Rayes, new spred, So rathe a Spring of flowring Hopes haue bred: And, after both his fauourd Names were giuen, The humane first, then that they brought from Heauen, All, in a ring, about him did appeer (Vnder the form of some faire Princesse neer, Or some great Prince then present there in view) To doe his Name the Honors iustly due; Each cheering Him to follow for direction The Propertie Shee brings to Kings perfection. Maist Thou (said one, as his sweet Eyes she kist) Great-little Prince, be of the Heav'ns so blist, That, though Augustus fortunes Thine surpasse, Thy Fortunes yet may giue thy Prudence place: Mayst Thou abound in royall Bountie so (Another said) that Traiane thou out-go: May (said another: how my Hopes aspire!) Thy Valour, one-day euen excell thy Sire: May there (said one) one-day appear in thee, Thy Martiall fathers match-lesse Clemencie: And, maist Thou fr? thy Child-hood (said another) Exceed in Zeale thy Mother and God-mother. In briefe (Pandora-like) Each offered there Their precious Gifts, in Præsage (as it were) Till with aduantage gracious Heav'ns produce Their wished-Counsails into Act and Vse. Grant, God Almighty, King of Kings, that Hee When on These Thrones his royall Turn shall bee, Hee may haue care t'accomplish euery-where What all our Hopes haue for him dar'd to swear; And what his Looks, Words, Maners, Motions, seem In euery part, to promise still for Him. May Hee, his People tender, loue, protect; Delight in Iustice, yield them her Effect: May hee forbeare to over-charge their backs With novel Tributes, or with need-less Taxe: And let them see that of all Titles giuen To all the Kings that haue been vnder Heav'n, Hee holdeth Good the best; better then Glorious, Warrs-thunderbolt, Earths-Terror, Great, Victorious; Whose loftie sound makes Princes oft become Abroad more feared then belou'd at home. High swells the Ocean, when the Moon's at full, And with proud Billowes threats both Hill &amp; Hull; But sinks againe, and shrinks into his Bed, VVhen Cynthia mues her neuer-constant Head: So (swelling proud; so, surly browd the while; So, temper-lesse; tempted with Fortunes smile) Ignoble Natures are too-lightly pufft; And with her Frowne as basely counterbufft. Farre other be His firm and generous Mind, Whether his Fate be curst, or be she kinde; Yea, fawn-shee, frown-shee, (firm indeed to none) Be He still like him Selfe, The same, still one; Still bountifull, still milde-maiesticall, And still vouchsafing free Accesse to all: So that no Barre (a Barbarous deuice) But due Respect doo seuer Him from His. For, be a Prince neuer so mighty Great, If betwixt Him and His a Bar He set; At length he sets one (which scarce ought repaires) Twixt their Affections and his own Affaires. Leaue He, to th'idle Pomp of Prester-Ians, To miss-proud Sophyes, and soft Asians; That Care, to keep their tawny Maiesties, From Subiects sight (saue once a yeere, or twice) And let Him daily (like the Sunne) goe out To cleer and cheer the clowdie World about; To doo the poore oppressed Widow right, To help the Orphan, ouer-born by might; To ease the iust sighes of sad Labourers: And alwaies (like that best of Emperors) Think That no Day, or think it lost (for nought) VVherein he hath not some such Action wrought; Or that he liues not then, or liues in vaine; Or as a Subiect, not a Soueraine. Consume not Hee in frivolous Expence, What gold a iust Loue's gentle violence Shall for his Succour (in extream Affaire) Force his poore People from their hands to spare (Nay, from their mouthes, nay rather from their bellies) Perhaps, drawn-dry with Pump of former Tallies. But rather, counting it (with some Remorse) Not Gold, but Bloud; may He with greater force Abhor to lauish, vpon idle Vaines, His Subiects soule, and th'humor of their Veines. That great King-Prophet (so renound for Song) Once for the water of a VVell did long, Which at the Postern of a Citic rose, Amid an Hoast of his most deadly Foes: Three of his Worthies (in despight of death) Brake through their Armie, euen to vnderneath The very wall whereas the VVell did spring; Whereof they drew a portion for the King. Then, off againe they brauely come their waies (Couer'd with wounds, but more with worthy Praise) And re-arriu'd in their owne Camp, their Prize Vnto their Prince present in humble wise. But He, bethinking through how many deaths Those dreadless Champions had then fetcht their breaths, In fetching of that wished Water so; For all his thirst, hee would not drink it tho: For, what is This (said he) but the hart-bloud Of these that Thus haue ventur'd for my good. So to Gods will, His, willing to accord, Hee offers it on th'Altar of the Lord. So, may Our Prince another-day imploy The publique Treasure, which with carefull Ioy, His louing Subiects shall (as ought the loyall) Yield to support his Port and Charges royall. May Hee present to th'in-sight of his Thought, With how much Sweat and Sorrow it is bought: What Rigor (vsed in his Name perhaps) Extorts it from oppressed Widowes laps, From wretched Crafts-men, from hard-racked Swains, Whom Pouerty at her owne Mess maintains; And, in Compassion say (with tender griefe) This is my Subiects bloud, my Peoples Life: This must not then in idle Pomp and Play (As water spilt) be spent and cast away. Then (doubting lesse the damage then th'abuse) Vow it to God, as to the rightfull Vse. And, 'tis to consecrate, and vow it right (And in a fashion pleasing in Gods sight) To poure it out in Royall (right) Expence; Either in War-works for his Realms defence, Or for his Honor; to all Times to seale His King-like Bounty, Prouidence, and Zeale. Close-fisted therefore may He neuer be To the true Seed of sacred Memorie; To Those whose lustre doth adorne Renowne, And honors Kings more then their orient Crown: To stately Structures, speaking Eminence, So as their Vse match their Magnificence: To wall High-waies; to heaw-down harmfull Ridges: To parallel Eld's Aquæducts and Bridges: Found Hospitals, or to endow them founded: To stop Sea-Breaches where they haue surrounded: To fence with Peers and Piles of sundry sorts From Neptunes furie his importing Ports: To build faire Shops for th'Helyconian Loomes, T'advance Their Arts, and giue chiefe Parts chiefe Roomes; And (as with liuing Nets) by Benefits, To catch both Valiant Spirits and Learned Wits. Millions of Verse haue sounded loftily The Prudence, Prowesse, Pitie, Pietie, And sacred Iustice of our Souerain Sir, As diuerse gales their diuerse Sailes did stir: But not a Voice, in lowe or loftie vaine, Hath of his Bountie euer sung a straine: Yet yeerly from his liberal hand hath come A million (a more then Royall Sum) Among those (happy) whom his Goodnes graces, Or whom their owne in his opinion places. Which of his Predecessors (first or last) In Gifts or Guerdons these faire limits past? Not one of them did euer reach so high; Yet Vulgar bruit (halfe false, halfe flattery) Giues some of them the great and glorious Name Of Liberal Princes, of illustrious fame. And shall not wee then, beare through th'Vniuerse His worthy Praise vpon the wings of Verse? Shall not wee say that his renowned hand, As worthily (in Peace) with Bounties band Can binde vnto him whom he worthy knowes, As brauely conquer (in the Field) his Foes? Be mute that list, and muzzle they their stile, On whom his Bounty neuer daign'd to smile (Were't through their own mis-fate, in hauing none, Or hauing Vertues, not to haue them known.) But I, whose hap hath been to march with those Towards whose laps This golden Riuer flowes, My Voice and Verse shall tromp-it farre and nigh To modern eares, and to Posteritie. And (without Flattery) say, that all the scope Of Wishes wayting on our future Hope, And all our Prayers for a Compleat Prince (As in the rest of Royall Ornaments) Need of the Heav'ns no greater Hap require, But that in This, the Son be like the Sire; And that he may (obseruing Golden mean) Giue like a King that means to giue againe: Yet, with such feruour to This glorious Part, That still he giue lesse with his hand, then hart. Vouchsafe th'Eternall Destinies-disposer, Kings sole Advancer, and Kings sole Deposer, That maugre Tyrants wrath, and Traytors wile (Whose Maister-peece we Heer haue seen yer-while) Hee may wax old (after his aged Sire) In Peacefull Raign, vntill his Raign expire: And neuer but at Tilt, or Tourney, feele The combrous burthen of a Case of steele; Or, when iust furie shall inflame his sp'rite Against Vsurpers of His ancient Right. But, whether law-lesse Need, or Glories loue, Him driue or draw, his Force in Field to proue, May He in Counsail, Courage, and Successe, Match his great Parents constant Happinesse, So as there be no need to spur Him forth, With braue Remembrance of His match-less worth. But, Laurell burnt, crackles in vain; and of-it Champing the Lease alone, makes not a Prophet, If that his Tutors haue not more to do, To hold him from, then to incite him to; To coole, then kindle, that courageous heat, Which makes men feare no death, no dangers threat: But, as once Theseus, ready to be kild, Was known to be the Kings sonne, that so wild; By his gilt Sword and signe engrav'n thereon: He shall be known to be His Fathers Son, By the Exploits of His, in such a Rank, As would haue made the two first Cæsars blank. Be He Benign, so as his Indulgences Breed not Bad-Boldnes, Feed not Insolences: Like to some Winters, ouer-milde and warm, Which neither kill the Weed, nor chill the VVorm; But breed the Plague, Pox, Murrain and the rest, That rotten Humors may, in Man and Beast. Not, but I know it farre more honorable To saue then spill (in Cases tollerable) Sith heer a World of Dust-bred Creatures liue, Can reaue Mans life, which onely God can giue: But too-oft Pardoning oft too-many drawes T'haue need of Pardon, through contempt of Lawes And Magistrates; whom the Audacious reak But Bugs, and Bridles to base minds and weake. In Mildnes then, be Hee so moderate (For his owne safety and the publique State) That neither Horror taint his Executions; Neither his Fauours harbour Dissolutions: And, too-remisse, by His too-oft Repriues, Turn Pitties Temple to a Den of Thieues. May He fear God, loue, worship, seek, &amp; serue him, Know, it's He sole doth stablish and preserue him: That Kings, as his Anointed, haue Regard: That but He guard them, little boots their Guard. May hee beleue His VVord, honor, obey; Take it, for Compasse in this Worldly Sea, Make it the Measure of Kings Power, in all; And, counting That of Lawes the principall, Haue it ay written in his hart's deep rooms; But, as a Prince, not as a Priest becoms. Vnder th'old Law (now abrogat long since) One might be both a Pontife and a Prince, For nothing seemed then to hinder them From matching so Mitre and Diadem: But now their Functions are diuided far, And Monkish Kings, now but contemned are: There Man and Maister but Hail-fellow is; And subiects play the kings, where Kings play Priests. May He be loyall, constant in sinceritie; In soule, abhorring lyes, and louing veritie: That as his Deeds shall (for the most) be Miracles, So may his Words be altogether Oracles. Th'Almighty grant, that during all His daies, All sparks be quencht which Factions wont to raise; For, for the most (to double Miserie) There be Two Kings where two great Factions be. But, if there should (which God forbid) succeed Such Mischiefs heer as heer-to-fore there did, May hee not want sound Counsailes happy Light, To guide him in his Fathers steps aright: Who, reauing th'eldest Emperors their Palmes, Suddainly turnd such Tempests into Calmes, By Means so milde, that it was rather thought By heav'nly Hap, then humane Wisedom wrought. But, were it Wisedome, were it Happiness, Match He our Wishes, and His Wise success: Th'one of Himselfe, th'other from Heav'nly hand, That Peace may prosper ouer all his Land. I know, that Princes beeing born for th'Arts Which Counsails, Camps, and Dangers schoole imparts, The Books most needfull and peculiar Theirs, Are Politiques, of State, and State-affaires. But, sith so few yeers doe our Age comprise, That euen the greatest of the greedy-Wise, Should knowe but little, if no more they knew Then from Experience of one Age they drew: That He, at once, may see all Accidents Of all past Ages, with his own's Euents; May Hee propose and set before his eyes The goodly Tables of all Histories; And there contempling all the true Records Of other Monarchs, mighty States, and Lords, Obscrue their Acts, their Counsails, their Discourse, All (notable, or rare) in all their Course; Both what to follow there, and what to shun, And whether Fame or Shame their liues haue won: May He there glasse himselfe, and mark it brim, Whether the same shall not be said of Him. For heer, Our Verses smoothly sing and smile: But History will hisse, in other stile: And Kings that heere haue been compar'd to Gods, Entombed once, though vnder golden Clods, If in their Liues they haue deseru'd it, first; Shall haue their Names torn, &amp; their Fames accurst. What may I add vnto These Wishes more? No more but This; that All heere wisht before, And All presaged of the Dolphin heere, Concurr in Charles: that all His Parts appeere A liuing Picture of all Parts of Worth Of all those Worthies whence Hee takes his Birth: That gratious Heau'ns (which promise euen as much) Is all These Vertues daign to make Him such, That really hee giue royall Assent To all the Acts of Vertues Parliament: That in his Turn, the Ages after Vs, May finde, and know him for Panaretvs: And sith That Name must needs Immortall bee, That no prophane hand blurr His History: But some sweet Daniell, or som sacred Hall, Or ciuill Hayward, (milde-maiestike, all) With purest faith, in a peculiar stile, A glorious Work of His great Works compile: Or, if that Any of more worthy Skill is, Bee He the Homer to This new Achilles. Great Britans great Hope of Great Hap to-come; Phœnix arising from a Phœnix Dust: In whom the Heav'ns (as mercifull, as iust) Restore our great losse, in Great Henrie's Toomb. Long long and Happy (in thy Brother's roome) Succeed Thou Charles, euer as Good as Great: Deriving, old, to thy old Fathers Seat, Wise, Great, Good Stvarts, till the Day of Doome. Which while I pray, sweet Prince, vouchsafe a space To read and rue Your humble Bead mans Case. Heer (like Leander in the Hellespont) Tost in a Tempest, in the darkest Night, Distract with Feares, divorced from the sight Of My High Pharus which to guide me wont: Spying Böotes in your Highnes Front, For life I labour towards your hopefull Light (May neuer Care beclowd that Beam so bright, Come neuer Point of least Eclipse vpon't) Yet, though (alas!) your gracious Rayes haue show'n My wracked limbes a likely way to land: Vnlesse (by Others Help, or by your Own) The tender Pitty of your Princely hand Quick hale mee out, I perish instantly, Hal'd-in againe by Sixe that hang on Mee. Sixe-times already, ready euen to faint, With grievous Waight of guiltless Want opprest, Bartas and I haue bow'd and vow'd our best Before the Altar of our Souerain Saint: And yet, the Eare that heareth euery Plaint; The Heart that pitties euery poore Distrest; Alone (alas!) seems Deafe to My Request; And only, is not moou'd with My Complaint. Yet must I needs (Need still importunes so) Importune still, till some milde Soule relent: But (vnder Heav'n) no Help no Hope, I know, Saue Yov alone, my Ruine to preuent: Yov onely may, Now onely, if at all: Past Help, past Hope, If Now Yov faile, I fall. Your Highnes's most humbly deuoted, and obseruant Seruant, Iosvah Sylvester.

VVhose seueral Acts, of sweet and souerain Vse To cherish Vertue, and to check Abuse (Too rough transcribed, by too rude a hand, For so high Statutes of the Holy-Land) Are heere presented, as fit Precedents Of sacred Rules for your High Parliaments; By (th'once, least Moat in th'Vpper-Houses Sun) You Vnder-Clarke, Vnworthily Vndon (By ouer-trusting to a starting Bow-Yer-while too-strong, to my poor VVrong and VVoe) Iosvah Sylvester. IOB TRIVMPHANT in his Triall. The Proëm. A solid Rock, farre-seated in the Sea (Where many Vessels haue been cast away) Though blackest Storms of blustering Winds dothress, Though boistrous Rage of roaring Billowes beat; Though it be reakt with Lightning, and with Thunder; Though all at once assault, and Each asunder; With massie Bulk of it Selfes Marble Tower, Still, still repells th'ineuitable Stower; And seemes still firmer, and more permanent, The more the Tempest hath been violent: Right so the Faithfull; in whose humble Brest Religious feare of God is deepe imprest; What-euer Stroak of Fortune threat his State, What-euer Danger him discommodate, What-euer Mischiefe that betide him shall, VVhat-euer Losse, what-euer Crosse befall; Inflexible, inuincible, pursues The sacred Footings he did euer vse: And aye more constant and confirm'd is He, The more extream his sad Afflictions be. If any Spirit inspir'd with Holy-mood, Carefully-curious of the Publike Good, Would liuely limne th'immortall Excellence Of such a Pattern of such Patience, As neither Elements displaced quight, Nor enuious Starres, nor angry Foes despight, Nor all the Fiends insatiate Furie fell (By fraud or force) could euer quail or quell: Twere labour lost, to fable (Homer-like) The strange long Voyage of a wily Greek; The Paines, the Perills, and extream Disease That he endured, both by Land and Seas; Sith sacred Truth's Heav'n-prompted Books present In Constant Iob, a worthier Argument. Thou then, Vrania, to whom right belongs The sacred Consort of Celestiall Songs, Tune Thou my Voyce, Thou teach me to record Who did incite, what did inuite the Lord, With Miseries so rewfull and so rife, So to disturb his quiet happy Life; What haynous Sin, what horrid high Offence, The Almightie's Vengeance mought so deep incense: Or else what Cause, what Obiect, else might stir-it. Boiles there such Wrath in an impassiue Spirit? Bvt, O Presumption! Why haue I begun (Alas! no Prophet, neither Prophet's Sonne? No Priest, no Leuite; nay no Israelite (Such as Nathanael) but a Cananite Full of Corruption, foule of hand and hart) To touch the Ark? to vnder-take This Part? Ah! pardon Lord; O! purifie mee all From all Prophanenesse; from Sinne's bitter Gall: And as yer-while it pleasd thee to infuse In mine vnschooled and vnskilfull Muse (By vertue of Thine All-sufficing Grace) Immediat power du-Bartas Track to trace: So as (how euer weak, and Art-lesse, I,) That Worke findes Welcome with the grauest Eye: Now more good Lord, my Wits and Words refine, To treat diuinely Matter so Diuine: O! sacred Spirit now sanctifie my Stile; Let not my Sensuall, thy pure Sense defile: But tune mee, right, to Eccho, as belongs, Thy Hvssian's Sighs, and then Thy Iessean's Songs. And to that end, vouchsafe me (at thy pleasure) Lesse Need-full Life, in a lesse Care-full leasure. Neere where Idume's dry and sandy Soile Spreads Palmful Forests, dwelt a Man yer-while, Of life vnblotted, and vnspotted Fame; Cap. 1. God-fearing, Iust, Sin-flying, Iob by Name. With due respect to Heauen's and Nature's Law In Wedlocks sweet Yoake did he seemly draw: Whence, by that Bountie, whose all Blessings bee, Seaven Sonnes he had, and louely Daughters Three. Great was his Substance: for, of fleecie Sheep Vpon the Downes seavn Thousand did he keep; Fiue hundred yoak of Oxen did he owe; Fiue hundred Ass shees, Camels six times so: Great Train within doores, &amp; great Train with-out, Made him esteem'd through all the East about. His Sons, by turns, their Sisters did inuite And feast each other, in a Daily Rite: Iob blest them euery Even; and euery Morn When first Aurora's rosie beames return, The good Old-man, to God, in humble-wise, For each of them did offer Sacrifice: Lest They might haue mis-don, mis-said, mis-thought, Or (in their Feasts) offended God by ought. While happy Iob thus brought the yeere about, It came to pass one day when all the Rout Of Light-full Angels did themselues present Before the Foot-stoole of th'Omnipotent, There also came the Executioner, Th'ambitious Prince, Malicious Lucifer: With whom the Lord expostulating, Thus Said; Sathan, say, Whence comest Thou to Vs? I come, said He, from walking in and out, And compassing the Earthlie Ball about. Hast thou not then suruey'd my Seruant Iob (Reply'd the Lord) whose like in all the Globe There is not found; so full of loving-feare, So faithfull, fruitfull, rightfull, and sincere? Is it for Nothing, said the subtle Foe, That Iob adores, and loues and fears Thee so? Hast thou not hedg'd him safe on euery side? Hast thou not heapt him Blessings far and wide? But, for awhile with-hold thy Fauour's stream, With-draw thy hand, and hide thy Bounties beam, Then shalt thou see (or double my Disgrace) Hee will anon blaspheme thee to thy Face. Lo, said th'Eternall from this instant hower All that he hath is in thy hand and power; All, but Himselfe, Himselfe I sole exempt. Satan eftsones assumes his bold Attempt. As all his Children were together met, Their elder Brothers hartie Cheere to eat Came one to Iob running, and breathless nigh, Scarce could he speak, yet weakly thus did cry, Ah! woe is me to be the Messenger Of so sad Newes as now I bring you, Sir: As all your Oxen vnder painfull yoak, Their pointed Iourneyes in your Fallowes broke; And as your Asses in the Meads did feed, Sabéan Thieues came forth with furious speed And tooke them all, and all your Seruants slew, I onely scap't, to come and tell it you. While He yet spake, there came Another in, Hared and hot, and Thus did He begin: Sir, from the Heav'ns a suddaine Fire did fall Among your Sheep, and hath consum'd them all, And slaine your Seruants yer they could eschew; I onely scap't, to come and tell it You. While He yet spake, Another came, amaz'd, And sadly said; Sir, while your Camels graz'd In your owne Pastures vp and down the lands, The proud Chaldeans, in three armed Bands, Surpriz'd them all, and all your Seruants slew; I onely scap't, to come and tell it you. While He yet spake, Another came and cryde In pitious Fright (as if himselfe beside) O, Sir! your Sonns and Daughters (all the rest) Were met to day at my young Masters Feast, VVhere, from beyond the VVilderness anon A suddain VVhirle-wind, rose, and rusht vpon The corners of the House, and shooke it so That instantly it fell from Top to Toe, And with the Fall them altogether slew; I onely scap't, to come and tell it you. Then starting vp, Iob gan his clothes to rent, Shaues his hoare haire, his head with ashes sprent; As in a swoune falls to the ground with grones, And sadly sighing Thus himselfe bemones Ah! Naked came I from my Mothers wombe, Naked I shall returne vnto my Tombe: The Lord hath taken what himselfe hath giuen: Blessed be God, th'Almighty Lord of Heauen. Yet did not Iob, for all that him mis-fell, Murmur at God, nor inly sink or swell; Nor sinne against th'eternall Prouidence, But suffred all with humble Patience. Another day, when all the sacred Bands Cap. 2. Came all attending their high Kings commands, Came also Hee, whose Envie (since Hee fell From Heau'n hath striu'n to hale down Man to Hell; With whom the Lord expostulateth Thus: Now Sathan, say, Whence comest Thou to Vs? I come said He, from walking in and out, And compassing the Earthlie Ball about. Then, Hast thou found, replyes the Omnipotent, In all thy Circuit, Man more confident, Or minde more Constant, or more faithfull Soule, Therr Iob my Seruant: whom thine Enuy foule, Late, vrg'd my Leaue by sharp Assaults to try? How hast thou sped? What hast thou got thereby? Alas, said Hee, I reft him but the things That flie from Men with transitory wings; And therefore he regards his losse the lesse: But would thy Power him somwhat neerer presse, Would'st thou permit me touch him to the quick, I yeeld me conquer'd, if he doe not kick; If more he serue, trust, pray, or praise thy Grace, If he, in fine, blaspheme not to thy Face. Pinch but his Body, and then, Skin for Skin, Hee'l wince without, and sodain flinch within. Go Fiend, said God; sith th'art so obstinate, Fall on my Iob, him felly cruciat: Touch not his Soule; his Body only touch. Hence Satan hyes, glad that he might so much. Without Delay then, with the most Despight, He sets on Iob; and in most pitious Plight, With vlcerous Anguish fils his body so, That crusted all in Scabs from top to toe, Amid the Ashes, sad and desolate, Scraping his Sores with shels (or sherds) he sate; Yet Constant still, still calmely Patient, Without a word of grudging Discontent. Then said his Wife, VVhat helps Integrity? What boots it, Man? alas! curse God, and die. Go, foolish Woman, the good man reply'd, Thy rebell heart doth thy rash tongue mis-guide: Shall we, from God, of Good receiue our Fill; And, at his pleasure, not partake of Ill? So Iob as yet, for all that him mis-fell, Displeas'd not God, but bore it wondrous well. By This, the light-foot, feather-tongued Dame Had farr and wide spread and disperst the fame Of Iob's Mis-fortunes (from the first begun) That He was halfe dead, and was whole vndone. His Friends then, Eliphas the Themanite, Bildad the Shuite, the Naamathite Zophar (as others) hearing this report, As soone as might be towards him resort; Resolu'd with Comforts, to relieue in part Their Friends Affliction, and asswage his Smart. But, there arriued, at the very sight Of his so wofull and so wretched Plight, They all amaz'd their Garments sadly tore, Their heads with Ashes all besprinkled o're; And for seav'n dayes and nights in Sorow drown'd, Lay grieuing, by him, groueling on the ground, Without word speaking, lest vntimely trouble Amid his Anguish should his Dolors double. Iob therefore straining his obstructed voice, Began Thus, sadly with a shiuering noise: Cap. 3. O! Wo be to the Day when I was born: O! be it euer of the Light forlorn: O! may it euer vnder Darknes lie, And neuer Sun vouchsafe it cheerfull eye; Nor God regard it: let a deadly Shade O're-clowde it aye, as euer Dismall made. O! wo be also to the Night wherein My Mother my Conception did begin: Lightning and Thunder thrill it euermore, Whirle-wind and Tempest may it euer roare: Of Fogs, of Frosts, of Showers, of Snowes, of Haile, Of Mists, of Mil-drawes may it neuer faile: May it no more in Calendar be plaç't; But, from the Role of Months and Yeares be raç't: May th'Euening Stars be dark: No light returning: May it no more see th'Eye-lids of the Morning, Because it clos'd not, at my wretched Birth, The fruitful Doore that brought me weeping forth, But let me passe into this woefull Light, To vndergoe so miserable Plight. O! Why, when shapelesse in my Mothers Womb I lay as dead, VVhy did not Death strike home: VVhy not (alas!) amid the bearing Throes, VVhen I began to feele Mans feeble VVoes? VVhy did the knees support me? VVhy the Brest Supply me suck? VVhy was I swath'd and drest? Sith else (alas!) I had now lien at ease, Had been at rest, had slept in quietnesse, Among the high and mighty Potentates, Kings, Counsellors, great Lords, and Magistrates, Who in the World to leaue their Names Renowne, Haue built them Bowers which others shall pul-downe: And those rich Princes that haue heapt of-old Their houses full of Siluer and of Gold. Or, VVhy (alas!) as an Abortiue Birth, VVas I not hid and buried in the Earth? There, Tyrants cease from their imperious Pride: There, Vertuous VVorkers at their rest abide: There, Prisoners rest from their Oppressors Braule: There, Slaues are free from their fell Masters Thrall: There, High and Lowe (without Disdain, or Dread) Rest all together in one Common bed. O! wished Death (more to be wisht then Life) Thou breakst the Force of Enuies Engines rife: Thou cuttest-off our Trauails Tediousnesse: Thou kilst our Cares, Thou calm'st our most Distress. O! to the wretched why is Light imparted? Why Life (alas!) vnto the heauie-hearted? (Who longs for Death: and if it linger long, Would fainer seek it then euen Gold (among) And gladder find it (as of Ioys the Chiefe) Within their Graue to burie all their Griefe) Especially, to Him whose Way is hid: Whom God hath shut-vp, stopt and streightened? Sith, yer I eate, My Sighes refell my Food, My Roarings gush out like a raging Flood. For (though my Plenty, neuer made me proud; My Power imperious; nor to pleasure bow'd:) What most I doubted I endure, (alas!) And what I feared is euen comn to passe. For Care and Feare, I had no rest before; Yet Trouble's come, and trebbles more and more. Cap. 4. Iob ceasing so; began the Themanite, Inly perplext, an Answer thus to dight: If We presume to comfort thee, deer Friend, Will our Discourse (I feare it will.) offend? Will thy Disease our kinde Good-wills disdain? But, in this Case (alas!) Who can refrain? Who so hard-hearted, or vnciuill-bred, That can vnmoued see thee thus bested? To see and heare Thee in this deep Distresse, Who can keep silence? Who can hold his peace? Why! Thou wert wont, in thy Prosperities, To stay weak hands, and strengthen feeble knees; To counsell those that in their Course had stray'd, To comfort those whom Crosses ouer-lay'd: Now that Mis-hap on thine owne head hath hit, Now that the Storm hath thine owne vessell smit, Now that the Case is Thine, How art thou sunk From thine owne Succor! From thy self how shrunk. Where is alas! Where is thy Confidence, Thy Constancy, thy Hope, thy Patience, Thy Piety, thy Faith, thy Feare of God, And th'vpright Path which Thou hast euer trod? O! ponder this: Who euer Innocent Hath perished? Hath the Omnipotent Eternall Iustice euer plagu'd the Iust; Destroyd the Righteous who Him only trust: As I haue seen Those that haue plough'd and sow'n Iniquity, reap sodenly their owne; When with the Blast of God they blasted fall, And with his Breath are quick consumed all? God, in his Fury starueth in distresse The roaring Lion and the Lionesse; Their rauening Whelps are scattered far away, Their Teeth are broken, and they pine for Prey. I'll tell thee more: Once, in a certain Night, Silent, I heard a Voyce, and saw a Sight. (About the time when Sleep begins to seaze Our drowzie Lids, our Daily Loads to ease) Amaz'd with Feare my haire began to heaue, My heart to tremble, euery part to leaue His proper Part; When to mine eyes a-space Appeerd the Image of an vnknowne Face: One stood before me, Whence (yet more dismaid) I heard a Voice, and Thus (me thought) it said: Shall Man be iuster then his God (said He)? The Creature purer then his Maker be? Behold, he found not in his Angels bright Firme Fealty, but Folly in his sight: How much more, then, in Those whose habitation Is but of Clay, but Dust their best Foundation? Whose brittle Vessels heer so little last, That yer they know them they are often past: Whose fickle Garment (how-so-euer loath) Shall be destroy'd and done, before the Moath: Whose doubtfull Daies yer they begin, be gon; Cut downe by Death, when least they think thereon: Whose Dignities (how-euer graç't, or Great) Shall die with them, and Them the Wormes shall eat. Now call thou lowd, if any will reply: Cap. 5. Among the Saints where wilt thou turne thine eye? Two sorts of Fooles (th'Idiot and Enuious) die; Of Anger th'one, th'other of Iealousie. I haue beheld the Foole faire rooted yerst: Yet haue I soon his Habitation curst; Because his Children succour-less shall suffer By Iustice Doom, and none shall Pittie offer: Him Selfe withall confounded void of Hope, To gather-in his long expected Crop, Which th'hunger-starued from the Thorns shal snatch; The Thirstie shall his substance all dispatch; A Misery, which God doth oft permit: For, th'Earth it selfe is not the Cause of it; Sith, were not Sin it should not barren be: But, Man, for Sin, must toile him seruilelie, In Sweatfull Labour, borne for Labour's end As properly as Sparkles to ascend. But were My Case, as Thine; in this Distresse, Rather to God would I my selfe addresse: Him would I seek of Him would I enquire, Whose Works are great, whose Wonders all admire; Vnspiable, Vnspeakeable by Man; Immutable, Inscrutable to scan: Who on the Earth the raine at pleasure powres, And in the Streets distills the liquid Showres: Who lifts the Lowely vp, brings downe the Lofty; And reares sad Mourners vnto Health and Safety: Who dissipates the craftiest Policies; And dis-appoints the Counsells of the Wise: Who takes the wariest in their proper Wiles; And Wicked ones in their owne Guile beguiles; So that they meet with Darknes in the Day, And, as at Midnight, grope at Noon their way: But, He preserues the Poore, from sword &amp; tongue, And cruell hands of Tyrants, prone to wrong: So that the Poore shall haue their blessed Hope: But Wicked ones their cursed mouthes shal stop. Lo, then, how happy he whom God correcteth? Repine not therefore that he Thee afflicteth. He wounds, and heales; he strikes and he restores: He sendeth Plagues, and Plaisters for the Sores: He in six Troubles, shall deliuer thee; And in the seauenth, thou shalt be danger-free, He will preserue thee from fel Famines rage; And from the Sword of War thee dis-ingage: Thou shalt be safe from scourging tongues of Momes, Nor shalt thou fear Destruction when it comes: Nay, thou shalt laugh at it, and dearth deride; Not dreading Beasts of fellest Pawes and Pride. Stones, thornes, and thistles shal be friends with thee: With thee the Beasts in constant league shall be. And, as without, thou shalt haue Peace within Thy house; thou shalt behold it, and not sin. Thou shalt perceiue thy Seeds seeds seed to spred As Grass in Fields, and Flowers in euery Mead. In a full Age to thine own Graue shalt Thou, As, in due time, Come to the Barne or Mow. Lo, This is Truth; and Thus we daily try-it: Consider it, and to thy Selfe apply-it. Cap. 6. Iob then reply'd: O! were my Sorows waigh'd, And with my Suffrings in iust Balance layd, They would exceed the Seas wet Sands in poize: Therefore (alas!) they swallow vp my voice: For th'Arrowes of th'Almightie, keen and quick, Haue thrilled me, and still within mee stick; Their Anguish makes my spirits faint and quaile me. Alas! the Terrors of the Lord assaile me. Braies the while Asse if he haue grass his fill? Or lowes the Oxe if he haue fodder still? Vnsauory things who without Salt can eat? In whites of Eggs is there a taste of meat? Yet am I faine, alas! and forç't (indeed) Of what my soule abhorred most to feed. O! that the Lord would daign me my desire, Grant me my Longing, grant what I require: Which is but This; that He would end my dayes, Let goe his hand, and let me goe my waies. So should I yet haue Comfort (though I burn In bitter pangs of Death, I will not spurn. Let him not spare me) for yet do not I The holy Word of th'Holy-One denie. But O! What Power haue I to persist? What may ensue, if I shall long subsist? Am I as hard, as tough, as strong (alas!) As strongest Stones? or is my Flesh of Brass? Nay, am I not already Impotent, My spirits consumed, and my strength all spent? In Crosses, comforts should Friends most afford: But men (alas!) haue left to feare the Lord. My Brethren haue deceiu'd mee, as a Brooke. As rising Flouds, they haue me soone forsook; Which, foule and deep, in VVinter all o're-flow, Or, crusted thick with Ice, no moisture show; Or else, in Summer, by Sol's thirsty Ray Are licked-vp, and quicklie dry'd away, While Trauailers to Thæma, and Saba thought To water there, and for their succour sought; But failing quite, and frustrate of the same, They are confounded, and they blush for shame: Even such are you, you see me ill appaid In dismall Plight, and you are all dismaid: Why are yee so? When haue I bid you bring, Or out of yours supply me any thing? Or crav'd of you auxiliarie Bands To rescue me from Foes, or Tyrants hands? Shew me mine Error, where I haue gone wrong: Tell me my Fault, and I will hold my tongue. But, bold and free's the speech of Innocence: Which of you can reproue; and what Offence? Thinke You aduantage of my words to haue, As if Affliction made me wildely raue? Then on the Orphan doth your furie fall; You dig a Pit to catch your Friend withall. Therefore, vouchsafe me better to revise; Wrong me no more: My words be neither lyes, Neither my deeds (as you shall find, I trust, If you returne) in that behalfe vniust Complain I causeless? Do I counterfait? Is not my mouth with Anguish all repleat? Cap. 7. Hath not Man's warfare his set limits heere, As hath the Hireling (by the day, or yeere)? As toyled Seruants for the Night attend; And weary Taskers for their Labors end; So haue I looked, but (alas!) in vain, For end of Sorrowes, and for ease of Pain. Perpetually my fruitlesse Months proceed; My tedious Nights inceslantly succeed: No sooner layd down but I long to rise, Tired with tossing, till the Morning spies. My Flesh is clad with Worms, with excrement Of lothsom dust, my Skin doth rot and rent: My Dayes flit faster then the Shuttles slide From Weauers hands, whipping from side to side. Consider, Lord, my Life is but a Blast: Mine eye no more shall see the Goodnes past: Who now beholds me, shall no more, anon: If Thou look-on Me, I eft-soones am gon. As Clowdes do passe, and quite away do flit, Whoso descends ascends not from the Pit; Neither returnes vnto his wonted owne; Nor of his place is any more be-known. Therefore (alas!) I will not spare to speake; I cannot hold, needs must I silence break, Amid the anguish of my Spirits distresse, And in the depth of my Soules bitternesse. Am I a Sea? or Whale? that with a Gard Thou girtest me, and keep'st me in so hard? If I haue said; In silence of the Night (When drousie Humor fiels-vp every Sight; When All, aboue, in, vnder Aire, Earth, Seas; In quiet Slumber seem to take their Ease) It may be that my painfull Pangs shall cease: It may be that my Passions shall haue peace: With fearefull Visions then thou doost affray me, With Dreames and Fansies dreadfully dismay me: So that my Soule had rather chuse (at once) To die, then liue in Durance of my Bones. Wearie of life, liue alwaies shall I not; Then leaue me, Lord, alas! my dayes are nought. O! What is Man that thou extoll'st him so? That Thou on Him doost euen thy heart bestow? That euery Morning Him thou visitest? And euery Moment Him examinest? How is it that Thou leau'st me not a little? Alas! nor lett'st me swallow-in my spettle? O! Thou Preseruer of Mankind, I knowe, And I acknowledge I haue sinn'd: but, O! What shall I say? What shall I do to Thee? Why in thy Wrath doost Thou incounter Mee? Why mak'st Thou Me (alas!) the Mark and White To thy Displeasure, in my Self's despight? Remit, O Lord, what I haue ill omitted: Remoue (alas!) what I haue miss-committed. For, now I goe down to the dust, to lie: And, if Thou seek, to morrow, none am I. Bvt Bildad then (loth longer to refrain) Cap. 8. Said; Iob, How long wilt thou this Plea maintain VVith words, as high as Tempests vehemence, Blow'n by the breath of thine Impatience? Dar'st Thou averre, that God doth Right subuert? Or that th'Almighty, Iudgement doth peruert? Though, sith thy Sons had sinned them he sent To the due Place of their sinnes punishment; Yet, if Thou early vnto God repaire, And to th Almighty make thine humble Prayer, If Thou be pure, and in his sith sincere; He will again awake to Thee: and reare Thy ruin'd State; thy righteous House restore With Peace and Plentie, manifoldly more. Aske of the Ages past: inquire (I pray) Of th'Ancient Fathers (for, of yesterday We Nouices knowe nothing in effect; Our dayes are but a Shadow in respect) Will not They teach thee (without wiles of Art) And truly speak the language of their hart? Can Rushes spring? are Sedges seen to grow, Where is no moisture; where no waters flow? Say that they should: yet would they sooner wither, Though neuer cut, then all else grasse together. Such is the way of all that God forget: So failes the Hope of th'Holy-Counterfait: His Hope shall be cut off: his Confidence Like busie Spider's brittle Residence: He shall be leaning on his House, but it Shall not be able to support him; yet He shall hold fast, and theron fix him sure; But that (alas!) shall neuer long endure: As doth the Tree, which growing in the Sun, O're-spreds an Orchard with fresh Boughes, anon, His happy Roots among the Fountaines winding, And round about the rockie banks them binding: If from his Place to pluck it any ween, It will denie; as safe as if not seen: Lo, by this meanes it will reioyce, the while That it may prosper in another Soile: So God will neuer the Sincere reiect. Neither the wicked by the hand erect. Till he haue filld thy mouth with meriment, Thy lips with triumph (in intire content) Thy Foes shall all be with confusion clothed, Wrapped in shame, disperst, despisd and loathed; Th'vngodly shall be razed to the ground, Their Tabernacle shall no more be found. Cap. 9. Iob then reply'd: I know, I grant you This; I God's respect, that No Man righteous is. No: if He argue, if He question; O! Who can answer of a Thousand, one? What heart so constant! O! what soule so clear, That dares for Iust before that Iudge appear? He is All-prudent, and All-powerfull too: VVho thriues, that striues with what he minds to doo? He mounts the Vallies, and he vailes the Mountains: He shakes the Earth; he opes and stops the Fountains: He bids the Sun shine, and forbids it soon: He seales the Starres vp, he conceales the Moon: He spreads alone the Heauens large Canapey: He treads vpon the bound-lesse ground-lesse Sea: He makes Arcturus Starre, the Orion. Stormy youth, The Pleiades, and Climats of the South: He worketh mighty things and manifold, Miraculous, and more then can be told: He passeth by me, and repasseth so, Vnseen of me, and vnperceiued tho: He, when him pleaseth, if a Prey he take, Who can compell him to restore it back? Nay: who so bold into his Acts to pry? Or, Who dares question What he doth, or Why? His Anger is not stopt, nor stoopt a whit; But strongest helps are fain to stoop to it. Then, how-much-less; O! how-much-less am I Able (alas!) with Him my Case to try? No: were I iust, I were not absolute; But, to my Iudge would I make humble Sute: And, to my Cry if he reply, yet hard Can I beleeue that He my voyce hath heard. For, with a Tempest he destroyes me sterne; And wounds me Cause-lesse (for ought I discerne); Nor suffers me so much as breathe at all; But fills me still with Bitternesse and Gall, If Strength we speak of; Who is strong but He? If Iudgement; then, Who shall mine Vmpire be? If I would iustifie my Selfe (with Him) He by mine owne Mouth will me soon condemn: If I would plead me perfect and vpright, He, He would iudge me wicked, in his sight: Though I were perfect (to my Selfe) from Sin; Alas! I know not mine owne Soule within. Therefore (Thus vexed and perplexed rise) I loath alas! and I abhorre my life. Yet, grant I not; but that the Lord doth smite (Which you deny) both Wicked and Vpright. Else, when He strikes a People (old and young) Would He seem smile at Good mens Stripes emong? Would He bestowe vpon th'Vngodly-most Earth's Soueraintie, and let them rule the Rost? Would He permit profane Bribe-blinded ones With blunted Sword to sit on Iustice Thrones; While that the Vertuous to the wall are thrust? While th'Innocent are troden in the Dust? For, Who, but He, directs, acts, orders All In all the World, what euer doth befall? My Daies far swifter then a poste haue past; Past without sight of any Good (to-last): As swiftest Ships, so haue they slid-away; Or as the Eagle hasting to her prey. If that I say, I will forget my Griefe, Forgoe my VVrath, and yet re-hope Reliefe: Ah! then my Torments all afresh affright, VVith Terrours, lest Thou wilt not quit me quight. For, if I be Vngodly, all in vaine I cry to Thee, and to no end I plaine: Or, if Vnguilty, Cleane, and White as Snowe (In mine owne sight) in Thine I am not so; But in the sight of Thy pure Eyes, as soild, And with the Garment that I weare defil'd. God is not Man, as I (in equall Sute) That I with Him should argue or dispute: Nor is there (should we meet) a Moderator, Twixt Him and Me to arbitrate the Matter. Let him leaue-off his hold, take-off his Rod, Lay-off his Awfull Maiesty, as God; Then will I speake, and freely, voyd of Feare: But, as it is, I must, I will forbeare. As dead aliue, vpon my Selfe I'll lay Cap. 10. My sad Complaint; and in mine Anguish pray Thus to the Lord: O Lord, condemne me not; But show me, why thou huntest me so hot. Lord! art Thou pleased to oppresse me Thus? O! dost Thou iudge as do the Vnrighteous (Vnheard, vntry'd, and vnsuspect) to trip And cast-away thine owne hands Workmanship? Seest Thou as Man? or hast Thou carnall Eyes? Years as Mans Years? Daies as Mans Daies, who dies; That thus Thou rack'st Me, and protractst Me still, Searching and sifting to find out mine Ill? I cannot sin, Thou know'st, but Thou must see: For, from Thine hands can None deliuer Me. Thy hands haue made Me, all, and euery part: And wilt Thou now thine owne hands Work subuert? Remember, Lord, how fraile and brittle stuff Thou mad'st me of (then vse me not so rough) Euen of the Clay, as is the Potters Crust: And wilt Thou then re-crush me into Dust? Thou pourd'st me out as Milk (within the womb) Thou mad'st me there, as Cheese, a Crud becom; With Skin and Flesh Thou cloth'dst me fair and fit, With Bones and Sinewes fast together knit: Inspir'dst me Life and Soule, Reason and Sense; And still preseru'dst me by thy Prouidence. These Things as hidden in thy Bosome bee: But well I know, that it is so with Thee. If I haue sinned, Thou wilt sift me neer; And of my Guilt Thou wilt not hold me cleer. If VVicked I haue been; then Woe to Me: If Righteous; Yet still will I humble be; Though deep confounded, and amazed much, To see, and feele, my sad Affliction Such. But, be it more: come, Lion-like set on-me; Returne and show Thee maruelous vpon me: And so (indeed) Thou doost: for, Thou renew'st Thy plagues on me; and me more fierce pursew'st: Changes of Woes, Armies of Paines extreame, Afresh inuade me, and me round behem. Then, Why (alas!) VVhy didst thou bring me forth From fruitfull VVomb (being no better worth)? O! that I there had perished, vnseen: And that I were as if I had not been, Brought from the Womb (one Tomb, vnto Another) To Earth my Mother, from my Earthly Mother. Is not my Glasse neere out? My Date neer done? O! let him cease, and leaue-off laying-on; That I may take a little Comforts breath, Yer quite I goe to to the dark land of Death; A Land of Darkness, Darkness Selfe (I say) And Shade of Death: where is no Light, no Day. Then answered Zophar, the Naamathite; Should words preuail? Shall prating pass for right? Cap. 11. Should all be mute? Shall no man dare reply, To mock thy Mocks, and giue thy Lie the Lie? For, Thou hast said (and that, too-vehement) My Words, and Deeds, and thoughts, are innocent; Pure in Thine eyes. But O! that God would speak; That He would once His sacred Silence break) To shew thee wisdome's Secrets: Thou might'st see, Thou merit'st double what he layes on Thee; And surely know that (in his Iustice strict) After thy Sins, He doth not Sores inflict: But seems to haue forgotten, or forgiuen Thy Trespasses against Him Selfe and heauen. Canst Thou, by searching, God's deep Counsel find? Conceiue th'Almighty? Comprehend His mind? Reach His perfection? It doth Heauen excell In Height; in Depth exceeds the lowest Hell: Longer then Earth: larger then all the Seas. O! What? When? Where? How wilt Thou measure These? If He cut-off, shut-vp, collect, reiect; Who can diuert Him? Who his Course correct? He knowes vain Men: He sees their harts that hard them In Guiles and Wiles, and will not He regard them? That foolish man, made wise, may be reclaimed; Borne brute and dull, as an Asse Colt, vntamed. If therefore, by Repentance, thou prepare Thine humbled heart: if that, in hearty Prayer, Thou stretch thine hands vnto his Throne aboue: Though thou haue sinn'd; if Thou thy Sin remoue: If Thou remoue it, and permit no more Iniquity to dwell within thy Doore: Then shalt Thou, doubtlesse, free from Fault and Feare, Settled and safe, thy Face againe vpreare: Then shalt thou sure forget thy Misery; Or, but esteem it as a Streame past by: Then shall thy Daies be then the Noon more bright; And Thou shalt shine, as Morning after Night: Then shalt thou rest secure and confident, Hopefull and Happy, in thy proper Tent, In thine owne Dwelling: where, for Eminence, Sutors shall flock, with seemly Reuerence. But, as for stubborne, wilfull Wicked-ones, That still run-on in their Rebellions, Their Helps shall faile, and all their Hap shall fall; And as a Gasp, their Hopes shall vanish all. Cap. 12. Then said the Hussian: You, vndoubtedly, You are the Men: Wisdom with you must dy: Yet (would yee knew it) somwhat know I, too; I vnderstand perhaps as well as you. Nor will I yeeld you in this Iarre a iot: VVhat you haue vrg'd I know: and Who doth not? Yee say, I lie; yee tell me that I mock: But I am made my Fellowes Laughing-stock: Who calls on God, and whom He heareth prest, Th'Vpright and Iust (indeed) is made a Iest: And He that's going downe (in state forlorne) Like dying Lamp, is to the Rich a Scorne; While (for the most) Oppressors prosper, sure; And God-prouokers, safely and secure, Haue in their hand (God in their hand hath put) The Horne of Plenty, them at will to glut. Aske but the Beasts: inquire of Earth, or Seas; Or Fowles, or Fish: for, which is it of These, But knowes, and showes, and plainly tells thee This; That God's their Maker: and of All that is: That in His hand's the Life of all that liues: That He alone, to All Men, Breathing giues. Doth not the Eare try Speeches (bad or good)? And, for it Selfe, the Palate aste the food? So, Wisedom should be to the Many-year'd; And Vnderstanding to the Hoary-hair'd. With Him it is (with th'Ancient of Daies) VVith Him is Counsaile, Wisedom, Power and Praise: Lo, He destroyes, and no man can restore: VVhom He shuts-vp, can be let out no more: He stops the Streams; then dry they vp and shrink; He sends them forth; then all the Earth they sink. With Him is Strength: with Him is All that is: Who erreth, and VVho maketh erre, are His: He doth distract the Counsailors of State: He makes the Iudges as infatuate: He breaks the Bonds of Kings Imperiall Awe; And brings them bounden vnder Others Law: He leads the Princes as a Captiue prey: Dismounts the Mightie; and, with strange dismay, He dulls the Learned, dumbs the Eloquent, And reaues the Iudgement of the Ancient: He powres contempt vpon the Noble-born: He strips the Strong: He leaues the Stout forlorn: He deepest Secrets soone discouereth: He brings to light the darkest shades of Death: He multiplieth People; and He mowes Them down again (by Famin, Plague, or Blowes): He sends them forth in Colonies to spread; And brings them back (by wrack, lack, sack, or dread): He reaues the hearts of those that rule the Earth, And makes them roam through Desert sands of Dearth, Where None go by; They grope as in the Dark; They haue no Light, no Sight; no certain Mark; They stray; they stumble; to and fro they wheel: And He, He makes Them, Drunkard-like, to reel. Al This mine eies haue seen, mine eares haue heard: Cap. 13. All This my heart hath weigh'd, and well conferd. So that, in This, what you haue known, I knew; And am not Heerein to giue place to You. But, as You wish, I also wish: O! would Th'Almighty pleas'd that I might be so bold (In his own Presence, at his Bar to stand) To plead with him the Cause I haue in hand. For, You, indeed, are too Sophisticall: Silly Physicians, for my Sicknes, all. O! that you therefore had still held you mute: So might you still haue held a wise Repute. But, list you now vnto my Arguing: Mark well my Reasons, and the Proofes I bring. Will You speak falsly for th'Almighty Lord? Will you for Him pronounce a Guilefull word? Will you be partiall for His persons sake? Will you for Him, with Cauels vnder-take? Shall it auaile you? will He con you Thank At his great Audit for this double Prank? (Or, ween you, smoothing, these Deceits to smother? Or, but to mock Him, as one Man another)? No: you shall know, He wil not brook nor beare it, Put chide you sharp; how-euer secret were it. Shall not the brightnes of His Face affray you? His Maiestie with awefull Rayes dismay you, Meer Earth and Ashes (daring thus to play) Your Best but Dust: your rest but Durt and Clay? Hold you your tongues: no more your silence break But (at my Perill) giue Me leaue to speak. Why should I teare me (as one out of Sense) With mine own Teeth? or doe Selfe-Violence? No: should He slay me, I would hope again (Though in his sight I still my right maintaine) For, He himselfe will saue and doe me right; And cleere mee from your doome of Hypocrite: Sith, in His presence Such can haue no place, Nor hope such help of His assisting Grace. Giue therefore eare vnto my words; and waigh With due regard what I shall truly say. Lo, heere I stand, as ready to be try'd (And well I knowe I shall be iustifi'd) Come, who will charge me, and oppose my Pleas? (Alas! I die, if now I hold my peace) Onely, but spare me in Two things: with-drawe Thy heauie hand; with-hold thy glorious Awe From frighting me: then from before thy face I shall not hide me; nor betray my Case: Then, at thy choice, be in this Cause dependant (I am indifferent) Plaintif, or Defendant. What, and How-many are my Sins (pretended)? Show me Wherein, and How, I haue offended, That Thou should'st shun, and turn thee from me so; And handle me as thy most hated Foe. Doost Thou vouchsafe a witherd Leafe to crush? Against dry Stubble doost Thou daign to rush? That in so bitter and seuere a stile Thou doost indight mee: and recite (the while) My sinnes of Youth (them re-recording fresh, VVith th'Heritage inherent vnto Flesh): And putt'st my feet into the Stocks so strait; VVatchest my VVaies, and at my heeles doost wait, To finde some hole in my fore-acted Life (Scourging mine Errors with thy Terrors rife) VVhile, rotten-like, it wasteth, as a Cloth Grown full of holes and eaten by the Moth. Cap. 14. Man, born of Man's and Womans loynes, alas! Hath but few dayes, and those full sad, to pass. Much like a Flower he shooteth vp, and fades; Quickly cut downe: he vanisheth, as Shades; Of no continuance [here]. Yet, dost Thou daign To frowne at Such? and striue with Me, so vaine? Who, from Pollution, can pure thing extract? O! there is None; none that is so exact. Sith then his dayes Thou hast determined; Sith that his Months with thee be numbered; Sith Thou hast set the certain Time he has (To Him vncertain) which He cannot pass, Forbeare awhile, and from him looke away, Till (as the Hireling) he hath done his Day. For, though a Tree be felled; from the Root, Yet is there hope that Branches will re-shoot: Though in the Earth the Root be old and dry, Though on the Earth the Trunk as dead do be; Yet, by the Sent of the neer-winding blood, It will reuiue, and as a Plant, re-bud: But Man (man's Body from his Soule bereft) Man down and dead; O! what of Him is left? Sith, as Sea-waters, past, re-passe no more; As Riuers, dry'd, returne not to their Shore: Man, Dead-asleep, shall neuer wake againe; Nor neuer rise, till Heav'n no more remaine. O! wert thou pleas'd, me in my Graue to hide, Vntill thy Wrath were past and pacifi'd! Or that there were some Time, or Term assign'd me, When Thou wilt cease; &amp; in thy Mercy mind me! Or, shall a Man neer dead, heer liue againe; Still liuing-dying in continuall Pain; And shall I still, in this distressed state, Wait, all the Dayes of mine appointed Date, Vntill my Change (my Renouation) come; When Thou shalt call me: nor shall I be dumb, But answere thee: Then, then thou wilt approue That Thou the Works of thine own hands doost loue; Though now my steps thou numbrest so exact; Not'st all my Sins, and seem'st them to haue packt As in a sagge, safe sealed; yea, to add New Trespasses vnto the old, I had. So that, as Mountains, mouldring down do sink; As from their places shiuer'd Rocks do shrink: As waters break the Stones; as Showres surround The dusty Earth; Thou doost Man's hope confound; And tryumph'st euer ouer Him, deiected; Transform'd in Face, as from thy Face reiected. Nor knoweth He, whether his deer Posteritie Shall poorely fare, or flourish in Prosperitie: But, while his Soule his Body beares about, That shall haue VVoe within; and This, without. IOB. The second Booke. Cap. 15. To This of His (so hot and vehement) Thus Eliphas (in the same Element): Should one so wise (as thou doost vaunt thee heere) Discourse so vainly? bring such idle geare? Vent from the Centre of a swelling brest As noysome Gales as the vnholsome East? Trifle the Time (about I wot not what) In idle and vnprofitadle chat? Nay: nullifie Religious Feare and Pietie, Not praying to, but pleading with the Deitie? Which thine own mouth hath witnest too-too-far, With subtile Cauils of a Sophister. Yea, thine own mouth (not mine) shall thee conuince: Against thy Selfe thy lippes giue Euidence. VVhy Man! wert Thou the first man on the earth? Or, wert Thou born before the Hills had birth? Hast Thou alone God's Secret vnderstood? And hast Thou onely Wisedom, in thy-Hood? What is't Thou knowest, that VVe haue not kend? VVhat vnderstand'st Thou, but VVe comprehend? There are of Vs as old as Thou; or rather, Some (I suppose) more antient then Thy Father: And doost Thou slight our Comfort (godly sent)? Or hast Thou of thine Owne more excellent? Why doth thy heart, and whither, thee transport? Why doost thou close thine eyes? that in this sort Thy Spirit turns (shall I say spurns?) at God, And from thy Lips spets words so bold and broad? O! What is Man that He should clean exist? Or Womans Son that He should Iust persist? Behold, He found, his Angels stood not sure: Neither, the Heauens, in His pure sight, are pure: Then, How much-more, before Aim, filthy stinks Stock-stained Man, who Sin, as Water, drinks? I'll therfore shew thee (hark, and marke me well) What I haue seen; I will declare and tell What, from their Elders, Sages yerst haue know'n, And to their Heires successiuely haue show'n. Such as, indeed, haue had the Helm in hand, To steer their Owne, and Strangers to with-stand. The Wicked Man's in-labour, all his Life; In bitter Pains, in Pangs, in Passions rife: Number of yeares are seldome His, to summe: A Sound of Feares still in His eares doth humme: Or, if at all He seem in ease to swim; The swift Destroyer shall soon seize on him, Hap-less, and Hope-less euer to recouer; Seeing the Sword, him euer hanging ouer. Needy, indeed; or greedy still of more (Pining in Plenty, staruing in his Store) He wanders, seeking of his Bread about; In dread of Want; of a Black Day, in doubt: Trouble and Anguish shall him deep affright; As royall Armies ready for the Fight. For, He hath stretched his proud hand at Heav'n; And stubbornly hath with th'Almighty striv'n, Running at Him, rushing vpon his Neck, Yea, on the Bosses of his Shield so thick: Because his Fat, his full broad Face doth couer; And lardie Collops on his sides hang ouer; And dwels in Houses, rather Townes of late (By Him) dis-patron'd and depopulate; By Him, re-built, re-gilt, re-glost, re-glas'd; By Him, re-Named (ready to be ras'd). Yet, shall not He be Rich; nor in Prosperity Persist, nor leaue Possession to Posterity: Nor, out of Darknes euer get shall He; Nor euer other then inglorious be: His Branch shall wither, and with Flame be wasted: Him Self shall, sodain, with God's Breath be blasted, Then, let not (hard-beleeuing haut Humanity) O! let not the Deceiued trust in Vanity. For, Vanity shall be his Recompence: Before his Time shall he be snatched hence: His Spring shall neuer sprout, his Flowers shall fall, His Fruit, yer ripe, shall he off-shaken all (As Grapes and Oliues, with vntimely Frost) The Lord shall shake them, and they shall be lost. For, th'Hypocrites Dissembling Congregation, Shall be disperst, and brought to Desolation; And sodainly shall Fire consume the Tents Of Briberie with all their Instruments. For, They conceiue but Mischiefe; breed But Guile, And bring forth vain Iniquitie the while. Cap. 16. He pausing heer, Iob Thus replies him, sad: Yet more of This? This haue we often had. You are indeed a sort of Visiters; A Crew of cold and wretched Comforters, Shall idle, addle, aiery, Words surcease? Or what doth make thee dare to dwel on these? Could I, as you, if you were in my Case, And I in yours; your Soule in my Soules place: Could I, against you, words haue multipli'd? Insulted on you? at you, shook my head? No: I should rather haue raught you Reliefe, And with my speeches haue asswag'd your Griefe. But, though I plain, my Griefe's not mitigated; Either, forbeare I, What is it abated? For, He hath wearied me: Yea, Lord, Thou hast Spoild me of All: and laid me wholly waste: The wrinkled Furrowes, on my Brow and Back (Bare skin and bone) bear witnesse of my Wrack. My Foe's fell wrath hath raakt and rent me sore: He striues against me; and still angry more, More eager still, gnasheth his Teeth vpon me; And with his eyes keen flashing frowneth on-me. My Friends (alas!) they laugh at me the while, They buffet me, and bitterly reuile; They gape vpon me, and together gather, Not to relieue me, but to grieue me, rather. Thus hath God hemm'd me with vngodly Bands, And turnd me ouer into Wicked hands. I was at ease; When, by the Neck he took-me, Brake me a-sunder, and to shiuers shook me: And (whether for Disport or for Desptie. Made me his Butte, and set me as his White. His cunning Archers do beset me round: He cleaues my Reines; and ruth-less, on the ground Poures-out my Gall: with doubled Blowes he crushes, And Giant-like, vpon me fiercely rushes. I Haue in Sack-cloth sadly sow'd my Skin, In Dust and Ashes haue I humbled bin, I haue (alas!) besmeard my Face with Teares, On mine Eie-lids Death's Shade hath swom, in Fears: For no foule Sin; neither, for Fashions sake, To seem a Saint: pure Prayers did I make, Pure and Sincere: else, neuer may they come In Heau'n, to haue either regard or roome. Neither, O Earth! if euer Blood I shed, O! let it not by Thee be couered. But lo, my Witnesse is in Heav'n aboue; My Record there, my Conscience to approue. My friends contemne me, and condemne me too: But, drown'd in teares, to God appeal I doo. O! that one might (as Man with Man, in Sute) That, Neighbor-like, one might with God dispute. For the few Daies of my set number gone, I goe the Way from whence Returne is none. My Spirit's spent: my Daies are don (and leaue me) The Graue's already ready to receiue me. Cap. 17. Yet are there with me none but those that mock me: Doth not mine eye still see them still prouoke me? But, put me in a Surety, giue me Pledge, To answer me what I shall then alledge. Who'll vndertake it? VVho will giue his hand, That to the Triall Thou wilt daign to stand? Sith Thou, O Lord, Their hearts hast hidden quight, From Vnderstanding, and from iudging right; And therefore wilt not, for their Arrogance, Admit of them, nor them so high aduance. Not, that I would, they should haue sooth'd me neither: For such shall perish, and their Seed together. But, to the Vulgar I am made a Song, A Tale, a Tabret vnto euery Tongue (Through grief whereof, mine Eye decaies and dims; And as a Shadowe are my other Limbs). The better sort, amazed at my Plight, The Innocent, iudge me an Hypocrite. Yet, shall the Righteous still hold on his Course; And the Sincere shall still adde force to force. Therefore, my Friends, returne, recant, re-call Your hard Opinions, and mis-Censures, all: For, of you all, not one Wise man I finde; Nor fit Physician for a troubled minde. My Dayes are past; and my Dessignes vndon; Yea, euen my Hopes (my hearts Possessions) gon: My Noone (alas!) is changed into Night; Small ods there is twixt Darknesse and my Light. What can I looke for, but among the Dead To make my House? to haue my Graue, for Bed? For, to Corruption, thus aloud I call; Thou art my Father: to the Worms that crawl, You are my Mother and my Sisters, all. Where's then my Hope? How shall that Hap appeer, Which you yer-while did so re-promise, heer? Those things, with me, shall downe into the Deep: And, with my Dust, amid the Dust shall sleep. Then said the Shuhite: Will you neuer cease Cap. 18. Your tedious Talking? Neuer hold your peace? Forbeare a while; giue eare a little now: Obserue our Speech, and we will answer you. But, why, as Beasts, are we vpbraided thus? And why so basely doe you count of vs? He, rather seems to be besides his Sense, That wounds him Selfe in his Impatience. Why? Shall the Earth, for Thy sake be forsaken? The Rocks remou'd? and solid Hils be shaken? No, no: The Light of Wicked-ones shall out: His Fiery Sparkle shall not shine about; Within his Doores shall Darknes be for Light: With Him, his Candle shall be quenched quight: His Strength shall faile him (or be fatall to him): His Counsels cast him; His owne Wit vndoo-him: For, his owne Feet shall bring him to the Net; And willingly vpon the Gin shall iet: Him, by the heele the subtill Snare shall catch: Him, shall the Theeues and Robbers ouer-match: For him are laid the Meshes of Mis-hap; Traines on the ground, and in his wayes a Trap: Him, on all sides, sad Terrors shall affright; And sudden driue him to his Feet, to flight: His plentious Store shall Famine soon deuour: Destructions, Sword shall hunt-him euery-hower, Consume his Sinewes, and vn-bar his Skin: And Pestilence (Death's Heire) shall rage within, His Hope shall hop without his expctation: His Confidence shall from his Habitation Be rooted out, and razed (as it were) And bring him downe to the drad King of Feare; Who aye shall dwell within His Tabernacle, (Because not His, not his owne Habitacle): Some secret Harme, som Flash, som Sulphury shower, Shall sudden spred amid his cursed Bower: His Roots belowe shall rot amid the Clay; His Boughes aboue be cut and cast away: His Memorie shall perish from the Earth; His Name heer nameless (as before his Birth) He shall be driv'n to Darknes, from the Light: And forth the World he shall be hunted quight. Nor Sonne, nor Nephew shall be leaue behind; Nor in his Houses any of his Kind. So that, the Ages, present, and to come, Shall stand amazed at his dismall Doome. And This is sure the Lot, the heauie Load Of VVicked-ones, that fear not, know not God. Cap. 19. Iob then reply'd: Alas! how long will Yee Torment my Soule, with words; and torture Mee: Ten times ye haue with too obdurate minde, Reproacht mee This: vnciuill and vnkind. But, put the Case, that I haue sinn'd, indeed: Must not I beare it? Then (alas!) what need You load me more; and magnifie your wit, To amplifie my Guilt, and Griefe of it? Seeing you see that Go o hath cast me downe, And with his Net hath compassed me round. Lo, I cry-out of wrong and violence; Aloud I cry; yet haue no Audience, Nor Ease at all: He hath so hedg'd my VVay, I cannot passe: My Paths, in stead of Day, Are Darke beset: He hath my glorie reft; And from my head He hath the Crowne bereft: He hath destroy'd me, euery-way vndone: My Hope, remoued (as a Tree) is gone: And more, His Wrath against me fiercely fryes; He reckons Me among his Enemies: His Troupes assembled, march against Me, egre; And, round about my feeble Tent beleguer: He hath disperst my Brethren from me farre; To Me, my Kindred as meer Strangers are; My Neighbors flie me; my Familiar Frend Hath now forgot me (as if neuer kend): Nay: mine own Household; Men, Maid-seruants, all, Count me a Stranger, care not for my Call, Nor will come at me; though I speak them faire: Nay: to mine own Wife (for the noisome aire) My Breath is strange, though I beseech her, sad, By those deer Pledges wee together had. The Basest scorn me; and when vp I rise, They spet their Spight in bitter Obloquies. Mine Intime-most, Those that I loued best Abhor mee All, and me the most molest. My Bones, in stead of Flesh, cleaue to my skin; And that not sound, saue what my Teeth grow in. Then pitty me, O pitty me, my Friends; Sith God on me his heauie hand extends: Ah! Why do you yet persecute me, rough, As God? Alas! hath not my Flesh enough? O! that my words (the words I now asseuer) Were writ, were printed, and (to last for-euer) Were grav'n in Marble with an Iron pen With Lead in-yoated (to fill vp agen). I surely knowe that my Redeemer liueth: And that He shall (This, firme my Faith belieueth.) In th'End of Time, return and rise from Dust (The First and Last) to iudge and saue the Iust: And, that, I shall, when worms haue eat This Clod, I shall awake, and in my flesh see GOD: Yea: I shall see him with These Eyes of mine; And with none else: though Now in Paines I pine. The rather, therefore should you now retract, And Thus Your-selues discreetly now correct: Why persecute We Him? Why hate Him, Wee? Sith This Foundation is thus fixt in Mee, Then, be you warn'd: beware, and fear the Sword: For Wickednes and Cruelty [in word] Incenseth Wrath: Know, there shall Iudgement come, To doom them right, who Others (rash) misdoom. Cap. 20. Scarce had He done, when the Naamathite Replyes him Thus: Therefore my thoughts incite My suddain Answer: therfore, am I spurr'd (Regarding light thy sharp and shamefull Gird) With speed to speake, vnto the Point in hand, What I conceiue, and rightly vnderstand. Know'st thou not This of old, through euery Age, Since first on Earth began Man's Pilgrimage; That the triumphing of the Wicked Sort, The Ioy of th'Hypocrite is euer short? Although to Heav'n hee mount his glorious Top; Though to the Clowds his head be lifted vp; Yet shall he perish, as his dung, for aye: And who hath seen them, shal ask, Where are they? As Dreames forgotten, shall he take his flight; Yea chas'd away, as Visions of the Night: Th'Eye that hath seen him, shall not see him twise, Nor shall his Places him againe reuise. His Children shall be fawning on the Poore, And His Extortions shall to them restore: His Bones are full of his Youth's sinnes (his Lust) VVhich shall not leaue him till he lie in dust: Though to his Taste his Sin be passing sweet, Though vnder-neath his Tongue he couer it, Though there he spare it, and not spet it out, Though on his Palate still it roule about; Yet is his Meat turnd, in his Bowells, all; And is, within him, as the Aspic's Gall: H'hath swallow'd Wealth, but God shall make him fain To spue it out, to cast it vp againe: He shall the Aspic's direfull Poison suck: With Vipers tongues he shall be deadly stuck: He shall not see the Oylie Riuers Currents, Nor Brooks of Butter, nor the Honny Torrents: His Labour neuer shall regain his Losse: He shall restore whom he before did crosse; The Restitution shall be all his state; He neuer shall digest, nor ioy thereat; Because the Poore he crushed, and forsook; And Others Houses violently took. Sure he shall haue no quiet Calm within; Without, no Store of what he ioyeth in. There shall be no Remainder of his meat; And his Reuersions none shall wait to eat: Nay: in his Ruffe, and at his greatest Height, He shall be stocked in full many a Strait: Continuall Hazards shall him round enring; Each spigthfull hand shall haue at him a fling: When he is readie for his rich Repast, On Him will God his fierie Furie cast; Amid his Feasts his drad Displeasure thrilling Instead of Food, his brest with horror filling; If he escape the Sword; from Bowe's of steel Steel-headed Arrowes shall him thorough thrill: The naked Swords bright-shining terror shall Peep through his Bosom, creep thruogh guts and gall. Horrors shall haunt him: and so, hard-bestid, From hiding him, all Darknes shall behid. A Fire vnblow'n him suddain shall consume: And woe to them that tarry in his Roome: Heav'n shall discouer his Iniquities, And Earth for witnesse shall against him rise; All his Reuenewes, all his state, and stay, Shall flowe to Others in his VVrathfull Day. This is the Portion of the Wicked: This His Heritage by God appointed is. So, Zophar ceast. Then Iob reply'd: I pray Cap. 21. Heare heedfully what Now I haue to say: Be this the Comfort you vouchsafe, alone; Let Me but speak; and afterwards, mock on. Doe I complain, or make my moan to Man? Why doe you crosse, or interrupt me, than? If I haue cause of Griefe should not my spirit Be moou'd withall? Can flesh and Bloud forbear it? Behold me well; and be withall dismay'd: And let your hand vpon your mouth be layd. Thought of the like (else-where) would me affright, And daunt my Flesh: How then, my present sight? How comes it, that the Wicked liue, liue long; Grow Rich, grow Great; wex Eminent, and Strong; They see their Children, and Grand-children, rife Settled about them: In their House, no Strife; No Feare; no Foe: They feele not any Rod, No stripe, no stroak, of the drad hand of God. Their Bullock genders, and proues euer fit: Their Heifer calues, and neuer casteth it: Their Little ones, like Lambkins send they out; Their Stripplings play and skip, and daunce about; They tune their Voice to sweetest Instruments, Harp, Pipe and Tabret; to delight their sense: In Wealth and Health They liue; scarce, euer, sick. Of long Disease; but to their Graues go quick. Yet These are Those, that to th'Almighty say, Depart from vs; ne will not learn thy Way: Who is the Lord? that we should Him obay? What should we profit, if to Him we pray? They haue not sure the power in their Owne hand, To get and keep their Wealth at their Command. Be therefore farre, be euer farre from Mee, Their Works, and Words, and Thought's Impietie: Farre be their Counsailes: far be all their VVaies: And farre the Peace of their so prosperous Dayes. And yet, how often is their Lamp put-out? How often are They compassed about With swift Destruction? In his Furie strict, How oft doth God their Paiment here inflict? How oft, as Straw before the winde, are They, And as the Chaff with Tempest whift away? How oft doth God, in the Vngodly's sight, For Their own Guilt, their own deere Issue smite? Or, lets Themselues heer see themselues vndone; Drinking the hot Wrath of th'Almighty-one? For, what is it to Them? or what care They (Their Months cut off; Their mouths once stopt with clay) What hap their house what hazard follow shall: What Weale or VVoe, vnto their Heires befall? But herein, who God's VVisedome shall impeach? Or, who shall Him, that rules the highest, teach? One dies at ease, in Strength's perfection growing; His Brests with Milk, his Bones with Marrow flowing. Another dies in Anguish of his Spirit; And neuer did good Day or Night inherit: Both are, alike, laid in the Dust together; And VVormes, alike, doo case and couer Either. Lo, I conceiue your mis-conceipts, from hence; Your mis-collections, and your wrested Sense: For, VVhere (say ye) Where's now the Princes Court? And VVhere the Palace of the wicked sort? Haue ye not asked those that trauaile by? And doe ye, can ye, yet Their Marks deny? That (for the most) the VVicked most are spared, Repriued heer; till That dread Day prepared For dire Destruction: and then (for their Errors) Shall be brought-forth, in That great Day of Terrors. For Heer so Mighty and so Great they are; Who, to their face shall their Offence declare? Who dares disclose it? Who shall prosecute? And their due Sentence Who shall execute? Nay (notwithstanding) to their Graue in peace They passe, with Pompe of solemne Obsequies; Accompany'd, attended (in their kinde) With Mourning Troupes, before them and behinde: Entomb'd among their Ancestors; and rest In gloomie Vales, as happy as the Best. How do You then, Me comfort, or confute; VVhile vainly thus, and falsly you dispute? IOB. The third Booke. Th' old Thæmanite, as mou'd withall, replies: Cap. 22. Can Man, to God (as to Him-selfe, the Wise) Be profitable? Any pleasure is't Vnto the Lord, if Righteous Thou persist? If Thou be iust, if perfect, and vpright; Is God the better? Gaines th'Almighty by't? For feare of Thee, will He reproue thee (strict) Enter in Iudgement, and thee thus afflict? Is not thy Sin great and thy Wickedness; And infinite thy foule Vnrighteousness? Yes: Thou hast ta'en thy Brothers Pledge for nothing, And stripped euen the Naked of their Clothing: Thou hast not giuen the wearie Drink, at need; Nor to the Hungry, wherewithall to feed: The Eminent and Mighty had their fill: They held the Earth, and swayd thee at their will: But silly Widowes hast thou empty packt; And th'armes of Orphans haue bin crusht and crackt. Thence is it, now, that Snares beset thee round, And sodain Feares thee trouble and confound: Or a black Darknes that thou canst not see; And a huge Deluge that ore-whelmeth thee. Is not the Lord in th'High Empyreall Blisse? Behold the Stars, how high their Distance is: And then (saist Thou) What can th'Almighty mark? How iudgeth He? What sees he through the Dark? Clowds couer Him from spying so far hence: He walketh in the Heav'ns Circumference. But, hast not Thou obseru'd the ancient Track The Wicked trod, to their vntimely Wrack; Who, quick cut downe, supplanted where they stood, Had their Foundations swallowed with the Flood? Who said to God, Depart from vs; and thought, What can th'Almighty doo to vs, in ought: Yet, with good things He fill'd their habitations. But, farre from me be their Imaginations. This see the Righteous; safe the while, and glad: And laugh at them, in their Destruction sad. For, We shall stand; our Substance not decay: But their Remainder shall the Fire destroy. Therefore, acquaint thee (and that quickly too) With God; make peace: and Thou right wel shalt doo; Receiue (I pray thee) from his mouth Direction; And in thy heart, lay-vp his Words instruction. If, to th'Almighty, Thou at-once returne; Thou shalt be built-vp: and shalt brauely spurne Iniquity faire from thy Selfe away; And from thy Dwellings put it farre, for aye. Then, as the Dust thou shalt hiue Gold, at will; Pure Ophyr Gold, as Pebbles of the Rill: Yea, the Almighty Thy defence shall be: And store of Siluer shall be still with Thee. For, in the Lord thy Pleasure shalt thou place; And vnto Him shalt thou lift vp thy Face: Him shalt thou pray-to; He shall heare thy Layes, And grant thy Sute; and Thou return him Praise: Thou shalt decree, and He shall make it good, (So thy good Purpose shalt not be withstood): And on Thy Wayes, and in all Works of Thine, His Light of Grace (and glory too) shall shine. Nay: when-as Others (as thy selfe art now) Shall be cast downe; re-comfort them shalt Thou, And Thus re-cheer them: Yet, yet may you rise; For God will saue such as haue humbled eyes. Yea: on the Noxious will he pittie take, For th'Innocent; and spare them for thy sake. Cap. 23. Then answered Iob: Though to this Day my Mones Right bitter be, my Griefe exceeds my Grones: How is it then, that I, as yet, am held, For hauing plain'd, as if I had rebeld? O! that I knew, that some would shewe me, VVhere I might goe find my Souerain Arbitrer. That I might speedy vnto him repaire; And euen approach to His Tribunall Chaire. I would before Him plead my iust Defence, And fill my Mouth with pregnant Arguments. Then would I know what should His Answer be: And vnderstand what He would say to me. Would He oppose me with his Power divine? No: rather would He steel and strengthen mine. There might the Iust in his iust Plea proceed: And I should ever from my Iudge be freed. But, Whether to the West I take my way; Or to the pearly Portall of the Day; Or, to the Norward, where hee worketh rife; Or, to the South, the Cell of blustering-strife: Whether I look before me or behinde; On This, or That side: Him I cannot finde. Yet, knowes He well my Way: and hath me try'd: And I, like Gold, shall come forth purified. My Foot hath walked in His steps: His Way Haue I observed; and not gon astray: Nor haue I started from His Precepts set, But priz'd them more then my appointed Mear. Yet, He persisteth in one purpose still. Who can divert him? He doth what he will; And will perform what is of me decreed. And many such things are with Him, indeed. Therfore, before Him, am I wonder-smit; Affraid of Him, when I consider it. For, God hath suppled and made soft my heart, And deep perplext me in my inward Part; Because my Languors neither end, nor I: Nor can I see, nor sound the Reason, Why. Bvt, can it be (How can it other be?) Cap. 24. But that the Times of the Divine Decree Concerning Iudgements more or less severe; When, Why, and Who, and How, and What, and Where) Hidden with God, and hidden from his Owne; Should to the World, and wicked be vnknowne? They shift the Land-marks from their ancient seat: They take by force mens Flocks, to feed, or eat: They driue away the silly Orphans Asse: They take for Pledge the Widowes Ox (alas!): They turn the Needy form their neerest Way: They make the Poor together hide them aye: Lo, Like wilde Asses in the Wilderness, They ramp about their brutish Business: Rising betimes for Boot (like Free-booters): The Desart Field yeelds Food for them and theirs. They reap them Each a Crop, from Others Crop: They gather Each a wicked Vintage vp: They cause the Naked without Clothes to lie, Quivering for Cold, no Covering but the Skie; Washt with the Showers that from the Mountains shed; Embracing Clifts, for Shelter; Rocks for Bed: They pluck the Pupill from the tender Brest: They take from Poor a Pawne of all their best; They leaue them Naked; Nay, the Hungry soule Even of his Sheaf, and gleaned handfulls poule: Yea; Labourers, that in Their service toyle; That tread their Wine-press, and that make their Oyle, That trudge and drudge in their Affairs; in fine They let them starue, and even for thirst to pine. The Citie grones vnder their Wicked Thrall: Th'oppressed, slain, and wounded, cry, and call: Yet, 'tis apparant (as the Sun is cleer) God doth not alwaies smite (nor cite) them heer. Yet, These are Those that aye the Light abhor: Know not her Way, nor keep, nor care it for: The Murd'rer rises (early) yer the Light; To kill the Poor: and robbeth (late) at Night: Th'Adulterer's Eye doth for the Twy-light wait; And, muffled, thinks, None sees my quaint Deceit: They (Burglars) digge through houses in the Dark, Which, in the Day, they for their owne did mark. But, Light they loath: Morning to Them is death: Death's Terror, Day; which all discovereth: On Waters swim they light and swift, for Fear: On Earth, as Vagrants, fly they heer and there (Their cursed portion) every-where vndon: By-waies they seek, and the High-waies they shun. As Heat and Drought, dissolve and drink the Snow; The wicked-one the Graue shall swallow so. The Womb that bare him, shall him quite forget; And, to the Worm he shall be well-com Meat. He shall, with Men, no more remembred be: But broken-off, as is a withred Tree. He weds the Barren that brings never forth; And, if a Widowe, leaues her nothing worth. Yet, by his power, He drags the Mighty down; And none is safe, if He in Fury frown: No; though, with Presents they his Patience buy, And build on it; on Them he casts an eye. Such, for a little, are aloft: Anon As lowe as Others; as All others, gon: Soon taken hence, shut-vp, cut-off, and shorn As (with the Haile) the tufted ears of Corn. If Thus it be not, Who will (I desire) Disproue my Speech; and proue me now a Lyer. Cap. 25. To This, the Shuhite answered shortly Thus: He is Almighty, Dradly-Glorious; Whose Power imperiall, and All-humbling Aw, Rules his High Places in most peacefull Law. Is any number of His Armies known? What Light so bright, but His hath over-shone? How, then, may Man, with God, be iust defin'd? Or, He be Clean, that's born of Woman-kind? Behold, the Moon, before Him, is not bright: Stars are not pure in his (All-pearcing) sight. Then, How-much-less? How-much-less Man (alas!) The Son of Man: a Worm, a Worthless Mass? Iob, heervnto replyes incontinent: Cap. 26. Well haue ye said; but, How Impertinent! How hast Thou holp the weak and feeble wight? How fit defended him that hath no might? How sweetly taught the simple and vnwise? How full declar'd the Matter, as it lyes? To Whom doost Thou this Speech of thine direct? What mooues thee to it? and to what effect? For, I (for My part) know, that, Not alone, Th'Eternall rules, on his supernall Throne The things aboue, in their harmonious Course; But heer belowe, the Better and the Worse. Beneath the Waters, dead things formed bin; And, dumb (their owne Inhabitants) within: Hell is not hid from Him: Destructions Caue, From His inspection, can no Covering haue. He, th'ample Heav'ns over the Void extends: He, vpon Nothing the sad Earth suspends: Within his Clowds He bottles vp the Rain, Which with it weight tears not the Clowds in twain: He hath in-bowd the fore-front of his Throne, And spread his clowdy Canapey thereon: He hath begirt the Waters with a List Shall ever last, till Day and Night desist. The massie Pillers of the Pole doe shake If He but chide; and at His check they quake. He, by his Power, doth the deep Sea divide: His Prudence smites her in her fellest pride: He, by his Spirit, the spangled Heav'ns hath drest With glittering Signes; the Serpent, and the rest. Lo, These are parcels of his Waies suprem: But, O! How little do we heare of Him! Who can conceiue? Who vnderstands the Thunders Of His more secret, and most sacred Wonders? While none reply'd, Iob grauely Thus goes on: Cap. 27. As liues the Lord, th'Almighty Holy-One, Who seems a space my Verdict to suppress, Loading my Soule with brunts of Bitterness; While Breath is in me; till my Spirit, inspir'd By God, be gon, and from me quite expir'd; My Lips shall speak no wickedness, no wile; Nor shall my Tongue deliver any guile. No; God forbid that I should iustifie Your rash miss-Iudgement. Mine Integritie I'll not abandon, to my Dying-day: Mine Innocence I never will betray: My Righteousness still will I fast retain; And, my cleer Conscience, while I liue, maintain. But, as the Wicked, be mine Enemies: Those, as Vnrighteous, that against me rise. For, what's the Hope of th'hollow Hypocrite (Though He haue heaped Treasures infinite) When God shall take (in a disastrous Day) His Land (his Life) his Goods (his Gods) away? Will God regard, or heare his howling Cry, When He is compast with Calamitie? Or, in th'Almightie can He comfort take? Will he to God continuall Prayer make? I'll show you, how th'Almightie hand doth deale: God's wonted Course I will not now conceale: Nay; you your Selues you all haue seen it too. Why talk ye then thus vainely as yee doo? This is, with God, the Portion and the Part Of the Vngodly and the Cruell heart: This heritage shall impious Tyrants haue From the Almightie, This they shall receaue: If many Children he shall leaue behinde, As many shall the Sword or Famine finde: Or, if that any in Remain be left; They, by the Plague, shall, vnbewail'd, be rest. If He haue heaped Silver, as the Dust; And Cloathes, as Clay; he may: but sure the Iust Shall ioy his Silver, and his Treasures share; And weare his Warde-robe, how-so rich and rare. If braue he build; it is but like the Moth (On others ground, as that in others Cloth) Soon dispossest: or, like a Watch-house, soon To be set vp, and suddenly pull'd-down. Such Rich, shall die; and lie without regard, Vngather'd to his Fathers Toomb prepar'd: Nothing of Him remains in Memorie: He vanisheth in Twinkling of an eye. Horrors shall seize him, as a Flood, with Fright; And as a Tempest hurry him in the night. An Eastern Storm him quite away shall chase; And, as a Whirle-winde, hurle him from his place. So pittiless, in wrathfull Ielousie, (While glad and fain he would his fingers flie) Will God pursue him; and Good men shall smile, And clap their hands, and hiss at him, the while. Svre, there are Mynes and veinlings (vnder ground) Cap. 28. Whence Silver's fetcht, and wherein Gold is found: Iron out of Earth, and out of Stone the Brass Is melted down (into a purer mass). Beyond the bounds of Darkness Man hath pry'd, And th'Excellence of vnder-ground descry'd: The rarest Stones, and richest Minerals, From deadly Damps and horrid Darks he hales: And, if som Torrent come there rushing in (Such as no Foot hath felt, no Eye hath seen) He can revert it, or divert it, soon, Without Impeachment to his Work begun. Earth's surface yeelds him Corn and Fruits, for Food; Her vnder-folds, some burning Sulphury flood: Amid the Quars of Stone are Saphires store: Among the Dust, the precious Golden Ore (Where never Bird, before did Path descry, Where never Vultur cast her greedy Eye, Where savage Whelps had never never traç't; Nor furious Lion ever by had past): On Cliffs of Adamant He layes his hands; Their height and hardness He at will commands; Slents them with Sledges, crops their clowdy crown: He, by the roots turns Mountains vp-side down: To let out Rills, He cleaveth Rocks insunder: His Eye perceiues all that is precious, vnder: He binds the Waters, that they shall not weep; And diues for Riches in the deepest Deep. All This, and more, hath Man. But where is found That souerain Wisedom, sacred and profound? That vnderstanding of the Waies divine, Of God's supream and secret Discipline? Man knowes it not; nor kenns the worth of it: It is not found in any living Witt. The Deeps confess, the Sea acknowledgeth; Tis not in Me; nor with Me; th'other faith. Nor Gold, nor Silver, nor all Gems that are, Can purchase it, nor equall it by farre: No wedge of Ophir, never so refin'd; No Æthiopian Topaze, Pearle of Inde, No precious Onyx, neither Saphire pure (Corall and Crystall passe I, as obscure) No Carbuncle, no Diamant so rare; No One, nor All, with Wisedom may compare. But, Whence is then, and Where is to be found That sacred Wisedom, secret and profound? Sith it is hidden from all humane Eyes; And from the sight of every Foule that flyes. Death and Destruction say; We of the same Haue with our eares but onely heard the Fame. God, God alone, doth vnderstand it Way; And knowes the place where it abideth aye. For, He, at once beholdeth all that is In all the World: All vnder Heav'n he sees, To poyze the Winds, and portion (at his pleasure) Vnto the Waters their due weight and measure. When for the Raine he stablisht a Decree, And for the Thunder's Lightning Mutinie; Then did He see it, and fore-see it fit: He numbred, pondred, and prepared it: And vnto Man This Maxime did apply; GOD's Feare is Wisdom, and From Sin to flie. Cap. 29. Iob yet proceeded, and said furthermore, O! were it with me, as it was of yore, In my fore-passed Months, my former Dayes, When God preserv'd me; when with gracious rayes His Lightfull Lamp reflected on my head, Whereby I walkt through Darkness, voyd of Dread: As in my younger times, when yet the Lord Vouchsaf't me Blessings of my Bed and Boord; When yet the Lord was with me in my Tents, And showred there his hidden Providence. When, where I went, my wayes were bath'd in Butter, And Rocks about me Rills of Oyle did gutter: When I had gone vnto the publique Gate To take my place where all our Senate sate, At sight of Me, would Young men hide them thence, And th'Elder sort stand vp, for reuerence: Nobles were silent if I present were; And, if I spake, they turn'd their Tongue to Eare: And th'Eare that heard me blessed me: and th'Eye, That saw me, witnest mine Integritie. For, I delivered every Poor opprest, The Orphan and the Helpless I redrest: He blessed me that was wel-neer vndon: The Widowes heart I cheered: I put-on, I put on Iustice, as a seemly Gowne; It was vnto me as a Robe and Crowne. I, as an Eye vnto the blinde became; And as a Foot vnto the Halt and Lame: A Father was I to the Poor: and where The Case was Dark, I would discuss it Cleer. I also brake th'Oppressors greedy Iawes, And took the Prey out of his Teeth and Pawes. Then thought I, sure, to die at home, in rest: And said, I shall with long good Dayes be blest. For, by the Waters was my Root out-spred: Vpon my Top Heav'ns nightly Deaw was shed: My Wealth increast, mine Honour daily grew, My Bowe of Health (my Strength) did still renew. When I had spoken, every Eare was prest To giue me eare, and in my Counsels rest, Without Reply: and as the later Rain The thirstie Earth, my Words they entertain. If I had laught, or smil'd on any, neer, They took no notice, nor would change my Cheer. I sate as Chief, I onely rul'd the roast, Dwelt as a King amid an armed Hoast; And, as a Man, amid a mourning Rout, That, from his lips, pours liuely Comforts out. Bvt now (alas!) My Puisnès Me deride: Cap. 30. The meanest mock me; Yea, and Those (beside) Whose ragged Fathers I refus'd, to keep My Shepheards Curs (much more to cure my Sheep). For, to say truth, what service could they doo? So idle bred (both Young and Elder too) Weakned with Sloath, and wicked Conversation; And waxen old, in wretched Desolation: For Cold and Hunger wandring heer and there, With Mallowes fed, and roots of Iuniper: Pursewd as Theeues, hunted from place to place With Hue and Cries; and ever had in Chase; And therefore fain, for Shelter's sake, to creep In Clifts and Caues; in Rocks and Dungeons deep: Among the Thorns and Thickets roaring rife; Wilde Out-lawes, leading a most beastiall life: The Breed of Fooles, the Fry of basest birth, Of name-less Men: indeed the Scums of Earth. And yet, to Such am I now made a Song, A Ballad and a By-word on their tongue: Yea, These despise me, and despight me too, Spet in my Face, and make no more adoo. Because the Lord my Bowe-string hath vnbent, And slackt my Cord, therefore these insolent Insulters Now loose and let-go the Raines Of all Respect, vnto their lewd Disdaigns. Now, very Boyes doe take the Wall of me, Trip at my Feet; and (in their Iollitie) Mis-iudge my Life, and of me Rumors raise, After their owne cruell and cursed Waies: They mar my Path that I haue walked in, Further my Woes, and haue no help therein: As a wide Flood-breach they haue rushed on-me, And with the Ruines have roul'd-in vpon-me. Terrors are turn'd vpon me, and pursew My Life as Winde; my Weale; as Vapours flew: Therefore my Soule, in sore Afflictions vext, Is poured out, and inly deep perplext. Dayes dark and irksom haue vpon me seaz'd: And in the Night (when others most are eas'd) My very Bones within me are opprest, Nay, pearced through; my Sinnewes take no rest: My strange Disease, with angry violence Of th'hot Impostumes loathsom Virulence, Hath staind my Garments: and, with straining Dolor, About my Neck it gripes me as a Coller. Laid in the Dust, I roule the Mire among, Becomn, indeed, like Ashes, Durt, and Dung. To Thee I cry, to Thee the while I call; But, Lord, Thou hear'st not, nor doost heed at all. Nay, Thou art also Cruell turn'd, to me; With hot Assaults, as on an Enemie: Thou lift'st me vp, (as in a Storm, the Stubble) To ride a Whirle-winde, while (with Fear and Trouble) I faint, and fall (dissolved, as it were) In deadly Swoun, hurry'd I wot not where: But well I wot, Thou soon wilt bring me home To death, the House where all that liue shall come; Whither, thy Hand thou wilt no longer stretch; And Whence, no Prayers boot, nor need, to fetch. Did not I weep, for Others Wofulness? Was not my Soule griev'd at the Poores Distress? When Good I lookt for, Evill came: when Light, A dismall Darkness, worse then blackest Night. My bowels boyled with continuall heat; A troublous time vpon me sudden set: Not with the Sun, but Sorrow, black I turn'd: Amid th'Assembly lowd I cry'd and mourn'd, With hideous Noyse (for horrid Anguishes) As kin to Dragons and to Ostriges. My Harp is tuned to a heauy Tone; My Musick turned to the voyce of Mone. Cap. 31. I made a Covenant with my constant Eyes, From gazing out on blazing Vanities: (Having my Choyce, whereon my thoughts were staid) Why should I once mis-think vpon a Maid? For, O! for such, what Part, what Portion is With God, aboue in th'Heritage of Bliss? Nay: is there not destruction still behinde, Strange Punishment, for Wicked (of this kinde)? Are not my Paths apparant vnto God? Doth not He see and summe the Steps I trod? If I haue walkt in Vanitie and Pride: If vnto Fraud my Foot haue ever hy'd: In his iust Balance let him weigh me right, And hee shall finde me by his Beam vpright. If that my Steps haue straid, or trod awry: If that my Heart haue hearkened to mine Eye: If to my Hand haue cleaved any Spot: If Blood or Bribes the same did ever Blot; Then let me Sowe, and Others eat my Crop; Yea, let my Plant be ever plucked-vp. If ever Woman haue my heart beguil'd; Or I layd wait t'haue Others Wife defil'd: Let mine again vnto Another grinde, And me be punisht in my Sins owne kinde. For This is sure a high and hainous Crime, To be condemn'd and punisht in the prime: Yea, 'tis a Fire, whose Fury would not cease, But ruine all, and root out my Increase. If ever I despis'd my Man, or Maid, Debating with me, and them over-waid; What shall I doo? What Answer shall I make, When God, as Iudge, their Cause shall vndertake? Did not one Maker them and me create, Of Matter like, in Manner like, and Fate? If ever I delay'd the Poor's desire: Or let the Widowes longing Hopes to tire: Or ever eat my Morsels all alone, And gaue the Orphan and the needy none (He hath been with me from my Child-hood bred As with a Father: Shee, in Husband's sted, Hath ever had my Counsell for her Guide, My Power for Guard; my Purse her Want supply'd.) If I haue seen or suffered any Poor To lie and die, Naked, or out of Door: Nay, if his Loynes be-blest not me from harm, Because my Fleece and Cottage kept them warm: If ever I, against the Impotent, Poor, Father-less or Friend-less Innocent (For Feare or Favour, of a Friend or Foe, For Gain, or Grudge that I did ever owe) Haue lift my hand, or him in right witstood; Or, when I might haue, haue not don him good: Then let mine Arme off from my Shoulder fall, And from the bone be pasht to powder all. For, God's drad Iudgements did I alwaies fear: Whose Highness VVrath I could nor balk nor bear. If I on Gold haue fixt my Hope, or Heart; Or, to the Wedge haue said: My Trust thou art: If I haue ioy'd for being grow'n so Rich; Or for my Hands had gotten me so much: If, when I saw the Sun or Moon to shine, My heart (intiç't) in secret did incline To th'idle Orgies of an Idolist; Or (Heathen-like) my Mouth my Hand hath kist: Or, if, in Summer of my golden Dayes, Or silver Nights shining with prosperous Rayes, My heart in private hath been puft too-high, Ascribing all to mine owne Industrie (Which had been impious Sacrilege and Pride: For, then had I the God of Heav'n deny'd): If I reioyç't at Ruine of my Foes, Or haue triumphed in their Overthrowes; Or haue so much as let my Tongue to roule, Or Heart to wish a curse vnto their Soule: Though oft, my Servants, in their rage extream, Would fain haue beaten, nay, haue eaten them: If I haue shut the Stranger out of Door; Or let-not-in the weary Pilgrim poor: If I (like ADAM) haue conceald my Sin, And closely cloakt my Wickedness with-in: (Although I could haue over-born, with Aw, Whole multitudes; the meanest Groom I saw, I feared so, I durst not wring, nor wrong, Nor wrangle with: but kept my Tent and Tongue). O! that I had an equall Arbitrer, (To heare, and waigh, consider, and confer). Behold my Aime: th'Almightie I desire (A certain Signe of mine Intent intire) For, He, I know, would sentence on My side; And witness for me, that I haue not ly'd. Then, though against me (in his fell Despite) Mine Adversarie should a Volume write, It, as a Robe, I on my back would beare, And as a Garland on my head it weare: I would, by peece-meale, shew my Conversation, All so vnlike to all his Accusation, That clearing Me, it should him more convince, To come and aske me Pardon, as a Prince. But, if my Land against me plead or plain; Or, If my Furrowes cry-out, or complain: If, Tithe-less, Tax-less, Wage-less, Right-less, I Haue eat the Crop, or caus'd the Owners die; In sted of Barley, and the best of Corn, Grow nothing there, but Thistles, Weeds and Thorn. Heere Iob surceast. IOB. THE FOVRTH BOOK. Here also ceast the Three fore-named Friends From farther Speech (as hopeless of their ends) Cap. 32. Sith Iob so stifly still maintain'd his right Of Righteousness, in his owne proper sight. Then angry Zeale began to swelt and swell In Elihu the sonne of Barachel, The Buzite born, and of the Race of Ram: Both against Iob began his wrath to flame (Because, as tenor of his words imply'd, Rather Himselfe, then God, he iustify'd) And also Those his Foe-friends, for so strict Condemning Iob, vntry'd, and vnconvict. His modestie him hitherto with-held, As giving place to others of more Eld: But, seeing Iob to a full Period come; And th'other Three without Reply, as dumb; His Zeal burst out, and Thus in briefe began: I must confess, I am too young a man T'haue interrupted you (so old) before In This Dispute; and therefore I forbore: I was in doubt; I durst not speak (till now) My weak Opinion, and present it you. For, Dayes (thought I) and Years can farther reach: And long Experience Wisedom best can teach. Men haue a Soule, and Reason's light inherit: But, Wisedom is inspir'd by th'Holy-Spirit (Which bloweth where it will, and worketh free, Not ty'd to Age, nor to Authoritie): For, Great men alwaies are not wisest found, Nor the most Ancient still the most profound. Therfore awhile to Me giue eare, I pray; And let Me also mine Opinion say. I well observ'd your words, with diligence I scan'd your Reasons, markt your Arguments: Yea, neer and narrow haue I watcht and waigh'd What Each of you, and All of you haue said: Yet is there None of you (apart, or ioynt) Convinces Iob; or answers to the Poynt. Lest You should say; We Wisedom compass can, God will evince him; not the Wit of Man. For Me, Me yet hee never did gain-say: Nor doe I mean to answer him, your way. Heer-with amaz'd, they still continuing mute Without Reply, or shew of more Dispute (For I expect dyet some Speech from some: I waited still: and when as none would come) I will, said I, now prosecute my Part, To giue my Censure from a single heart: For, I am full of matter to the top; My Spirit within me, strains me, stirs me vp: My Brest is like a Wine-Butt, wanting Vent, Ready to burst; or Bottles, like to slent. I'll therefore speak, that I may yet re-spire; And ope my mouth, to fanne mine inward fire. Yet None, I pray, from Me the while expect Smooth, soothing Titles; personall Respect: For, soothing Titles know not I to giue; Nor, should I, would my Maker let me liue. Cap. 33. Now therefore, Iob, hark with attentiue heed To all the Words that from me shall proceed: For, what I speak, premeditated is; Not out of Passion, or of Preiudice: But most sincere, and from a single heart, Out of cleer Knowledge (without Clowds of Art). One and the same, of the same Mass of Mire, Made Me, as Thee; and did my Spirit inspire: Fear not therefore, if Thou haue ought to say; Oppose and answer: put thy Words in ray: I am (according to thy wish) to plead And parley with thee, in th'Almighties stead; And yet, a Man: My Terrors shall not fright thee, Neither my hand with heauy Tortures smite thee. Lo, Thou hast sayd (I heard and markt it well) In Mee, there none Iniquity doth dwell: I am Vpright, and Clean, and Innocent: Yet, as a Foe, Hee is against mee bent: Hee picks occasions to inflict mee Stroaks; Sifts all my Waies, and sets mee in the Stocks. And lo, in This, even in This saying so, Thou art not Iust: for (if thou know'st not) know, That God is Greater than All Men: then, Why Striv'st Thou with Him? whose supreme Soveraignty. Yeelds vs no Reason, nor Account at all, Of His high Counsails; Why, or How, they fall. For once, yea twice, to Man th'Almighty speaks; Yet Man perceiues not (or it little reaks) By Dream, or Vision of the Night, in Sleep Vpon his Bed; or in some Slumber deep: Then opens He Mens eares, and him revealeth, And sweetly there their meet Instruction sealeth; To turn a Man from his intended Ill, And hide the Pride of his ambitious Will: To keep his Soule back from the brink of Hell; And saue his Life from Death and Dangers fell. Some-times, Hee's also chast'ned on his Bed, With grievous Sicknes, from the foot to head; Incessant burning in his Bones and Blood: So that he loatheth the most dainty Food. His Flesh consumed, and his Bones so high That they appeare (as an Anatomie): His Life and Soule draw neer vnto the Pit, (The Graue doth gape, and Worms doo wait for it). If with Him be a holy Messenger (One of a Thousand) an Interpreter, To shew to Man the Iustice of his God, In his Correction, with his sharpest Rod; And, Rightly humbled, re-advance the Meek, By Faith, aboue his Righteousness to seek, And pray to Him; He will propitious stand, And to his Servant He will Thus command, Deliver him from going to the Graue, I am appeas'd: a Ransom found I haue. Then, than a Childe shall fresher be his Flesh, He shall return vnto his Youth afresh: Then shall he call on God, and God shall be Right gracious to him: He with ioy shall see His glorious Face. For, He will render than (He will impute) His Righteousness to Man. He visits Men; and if that any say, I haue offended: I haue gon astray: I haue miss-done: I haue perverted Right: O! I haue sinn'd, and had no profit by't; He will deliver, from Infernall Doom, His Soule; his Life from an vntimely Toomb. Lo, all These things doth God doo twice or thrice (Oft and again) to Man (too prone to Vice) To re-reduce his Soule from Death's dark Night; To be enlightned with the living Light. Iob, mark it well, And harken farther yet What I shall speak: saue, when thou seest it fit, If ought thou haue to answer, or obiect, Speak on, in God's Name (for I much affect To iustifie and cleer thee (if I may): If otherwise, if nought thou haue to say; List, and obserue with silence, I beseech; And I shall teach thee Wisedom, by my Speech. Cap. 34. So, he proceeded, and said furthermore: Heare Me, ye Sages; Men of Skilfull lore: For, as the Palate doth discern of Food, Th'Eare tryeth words (how they be bad, or good). Let's then debate This Matter, among vs; Examine it, and what is right, discuss. For, Iob hath said: O! I am Iust, Vpright; And yet (saith He) GOD hath bereft my Right. Should I belye my Cause? My thrilled Wound Is past all Cure; and yet no Crime is found. What man, like Iob, himselfe so over-thinks? Who (wilfully) Contempt, like Water, drinks: Who, with the Wicked and Vngodly walks, Iumps iust with Them, and in their language talks. For, he hath said; Man hath no profit by 't To walk with GOD, and in Him to delight. But, heare me now, all yee that vnderstand; O! be it farre from the All-ruling hand Of Iustice Selfe (th'Almighty God, most High) To doe Iniustice, or Iniquitie. No: He to Each man his owne Work repayes; And makes him finde according to his Waies. Vndoubtedly, the Lord of Hosts, the Strong, Nor hath, nor doth, nor will, nor can, do wrong. Who hath to Him charge of the Earth impos'd? And, Who but He, hath the whole World dispos'd? If He but please on Man to set his minde, To re-assume his Spirit, his Breath, his Winde; All Flesh at once (if He but hold his breath) Shall turn to Dust; and perish all, in death. Now note Thou this, if so thou hast a heart To vnderstand; list what my Words impart: Shall He haue Rule, that Iudgement loathes (and lacks)? And for vniust, wilt Thou the Iustest tax? Beseems it Any to a King to say, O! Thou art Wicked (in thy partiall Sway)? Or vnto Princes (to vpbraid them) Thus, You are Vngodly, you are Impious? Then, how-much-less to Him that puts no Ods Touching the Persons of those Earthly Gods; Nor twixt the Rich and Poor, the Great and Small; For, they (alike) are his owne Hands-work, all. They (at His will) shall in a moment die; Yea, even at Midnight (vnexpectedly) The People shall be troubled and transported; And even the Princes, without hands subverted. For, evermore His Eyes are open wide On all Mens Waies, on every Step and Stride. There is no Darkness, nor no Shade of Death, For Wicked-ones to hide them vnder-neath: Nor, will he Any yet so over-load, That they may iustly grudge, or plead with God. By Heaps, will He to peeces grinde the Great, And (in their steed) set Others in their seat: For, vnto Him, their Works are manifest; Night turn'd to Light: and they shall be supprest. Them, as most Wicked, smites he (as it were, In all mens sight, in open Theatre) Because from Him they did revolt and swerue; And would not any of his Waies obserue: But caus'd the loud Cries of the Poor ascend To Him, who alwaies doth their Cries attend. When He giues Quiet, who dares be so bold To cause Disturbance? And, if He with-hold His Countenance, who then behold Him can; Whether a People, or a Private man? That th'Hypocrite no more may Raign (as King) Nor, vnder him, the snared People wring. Vs therefore Thus beseems, to say to God: I beare with Patience thy correcting Rod: I will not murmur, nor burst out therfore; But sigh in silence, and offend no more: Shew me my Sins I see not, nor perceiue; And, Hence forth will I all Iniustice leaue. Or, should it be after Thy pleasure ay? No: will-thou-nill, He will (not I) repay. Now, therefore speak thy Conscience seriously; And let the prudent mark and testifie, That, voyd of Knowledge, Iob hath mis-averr'd; And, wide of Wisdom, his Discourse hath err'd. Would therefore (Father) he might yet be try'd: Sith for the Wicked he hath so reply'd; For, to his Sin he doth Rebellion ad: Claps hands at vs, as He the Better had: And (too-too-pure in his too-prudent Eyes) Against th'Almighty, Words he multiplies. Elihu speaking, Thus moreover said: Cap. 35. Thinkst Thou this right (if it be rightly waid) Which thou hast spoken (or thy Speech imply'd) My Righteousness is more than God's (O Pride!). For, Thou hast said, What will it vantage mee, What shall I gain, if I from Sin be free? I'll answer thee; and with Thee, All so dreaming: Look-vp, and see the Heav'ns aboue thee gleaming; Behold, how high: If therefore thou transgress, And multiply thy Sin and Wickedness; What hurt doost Thou to God? What Detriment? On th'other side, if Thou be Innocent, If Iust; What doost Thou to his Goodnes giue? Or, from Thy hand, What, What doth He receiue? Thy Wickedness may hurt a Man (like thee): Thy righteousness, to Man may helpfull be. For manifold and frequent Tyranny, Oppressors make oppressed-ones to cry; Yea, to cry-out for cruell Violence Of Mighty-ones, of Men of Eminence: But, there is None that saith (as due belongs) Where's God, my Maker (Who by Night giues Songs, Who teacheth vs, hath vs more Wisedom given, Than Beasts of Earth, or to the Fowles of Heaven). There cry they oft; but none doth heare or heed, For, th'Evils sake (who in all Ills exceed): For, Vanity, God doth not, hath not heard; Nor ever will th'Almighty it regard. Now, though Thou saist, thou seest Him not, Hee's Iust: With Him is Iudgement; therefore in Him trust: For want whereof, his Wrath hath visited; Yet not so hot as Thou hast merited. Therefore doth Iob open his Mouth in vain: And voyd of Knowledge, yet, yet, mis-complain. Cap 36. Elihu said: A little suffer me; For I haue yet more to alledge to Thee, On God's behalfe. I'll fetch mine Arguments From farre (confirm'd by long Experience) To iustifie my Maker's Holiness, Giue Him his owne, and right his Righteousness. I'll speake no Falshood, nor no Fraud propound: All my Discourse shall be sincere and sound. Lo, God is Mighty; yet doth none despise: Omnipotent, Omniscient; Strong and Wise. He spareth not the Life of Wicked wights; But, the Oppressed in their wrongs he rights: His Eyes are never off the Righteous sort: Them on the Throne He doth with Kings consort: Them He advances; and beyond all Term Doth them establish, and them fast confirm. Or, if that ever Fetters them befall, Or, they be holden in Afflictions Thrall; He lets them see their Works, their Wickedness, Their wandring By-waies, and their bold Excess; And opens then their Eare to Disciplin, Commanding quick, that they return from Sin. If they return, to serue and Him obey, Their Dayes and Years right happy spend shall They: If not; the Sword shall smite them suddenly: And in their wilfull Folly shall they die. But Hypocrites, the Men of double heart, They heap-vp Wrath: they cry not when they smart. They die in Youth; their Life among th'Vncleane, Most Insolent, most Impudent, Obscœne. He th'humble Poor in his Affliction frees: Their Eares he opens, in Calamities: So would He, Thee from Thy Distress haue freed, And brought thee forth far from the Streits of Need, To spacious Plenty; and thenceforth thy Boord Should with the best and fattest haue been stor'd: But, Thou, too-wicked-like, too-stiffe hast stood; As their presumptions seeming to make good; Not stoopt, but strutted in Contesting Pride. Therefore, on Thee doth Iudgement yet abide. Sith wroth he is, beware to tempt him more; Lest with his Stroak, he sudden smite thee ore: Or hisse thee hence with his all-mighty Breath: Then can no Ransom thee redeem from Death. Will He regard thy Goods? or reak thy Gold? Thy State, or Strength (how much, or manifold? Nor wish Thou (hope-less) for the (hap-less) Night, When from their place People are taken quight: Beware, regard not Thou Iniquitie; Neither (alas!) through faint Infirmitie, Chuse rather That, than thine Affliction's Part, With humble Patience of a Constant heart. Behold the Lord is, for his Power, suprem: And, for his Prudence, Who doth teach like Him? Who hath appointed vnto Him his way? Or, Who can tell him, Thou hast gon astray? Rather, remember that thou magnifie His publike Works, apparant to our Eye; So visible, that both the young and old, Them from a farre do bright and brim behold. Lo, God is Greater then We comprehend: Nor can the Number of his years be kend. He makes the thick exhaled Vapours thin, That down again in silver Deaws they spin, From strouting Clowds aboundantly distilling For th'vse of Man, the Plains with Plenty filling. Also, can Any vnderstand th'Extent Of Clowds, or know the Rattling of his Tent? Behold, He spreadeth out his Light there-over, And even the bottom of the Sea doth cover. For, by the same He worketh divers-waies, Both to his Iustice and his Mercie's Praise: That, through excess causing a fearfull Flood; This, temperate, producing store of Food. He vailes the Light with Clowds that come between, Forbids it shine, and lets it not be seen: Boading a Shower, or Storms approaching rage: Which oft, even Cattell of the Field presage. Cap. 37. Here-at, my Heart trembles for inward Feare, As if remov'd from it owne place it were: Hark, hark with heed vnto the hideous Noyce, The horrid Rumbling of his dreadfull Voyce, Which, with his Lightning, he directeth forth, Vnder whole Heav'n, and over all the Earth. After the Flash, a Clash there roareth high; He thunders-out his Voyce of Maiestie: And then no longer will He keep them back, When that is heard over our heads to crack. God, with his Voyce, doth thunder wondrously, And works great things that we cannot discry: He bids the Snow to cover Hill and Plain; So, drizling Showers; and so, his Mighty Rain; Whereby, From Field-works He seals-vp mens hands, That they may know His works how He commands. Then, to their Den the Savage Heards do hie; And for a season in their Covert lie. From Southern Chambers the hot Whirl-wind coms: From Northren Cels, That which with Cold benumbs. The Frost is given vs, by the breath divine; When Crusts of Crystall spreading Floods confine. The blackest Clowd He doth exhaust of waters: And, his bright Clowd (the Lightnings shroud) he scatters. And (by the Counsaile of his Providence) All This, by Turns, in round Circumference Is turn'd about: and ready at his Call, Throughout the World, to do his will, in all. For, He commands them come, for Punishment, Or Loue to His; or else Indifferent. Harken to This, O Iob; stand still, and ponder The Works of God, so full of waight and wonder. Know'st Thou (alas!) when He disposed them; Or caus'd the Light out of his Lump to beam? Know'st Thou the Clowd's iust Poize (the high or lower) And wondrous works of the All-perfect Knower? How, when He calms the Earth with Southern puff, Thy thinnest Clothes thou findest warm enough. Hast Thou, with Him, spred forth the spangled Skie, That (liquid Crystall-like) strong Canopie? If so; then shew vs, what to say to Him: For, what to say, we are (alas!) too dim. Should I mis-speak, needs any Him inform? Nay, should I not be swallowed vp (in storm)? None fixly can (when clowds be clear'd away) Behold the bright and shining Lamp of Day. From out the North stream goodly Beams of gold: With God is Light more bright by manifold, More pure, more pearcing, past a mortall Eye; More dreadfull farre. His glorious Maiestie (Dwelling aboue, in Splendors inaccessible) For vs to find out, is a poynt impossible. Hee's excellent in Prudence: passing Strong: Plentious in Iustice: and doth No man wrong. Therefore Men fear him: Yet, for Their desert, Regards not He those that are Wise of heart. Then, drad Iehova from a Whirle-wind spake In sacred tearms; and Thus with Iob hee brake: Cap. 38. Where? Who is He, that (to Himselfe so holy) Darkens my Counsailes, with contentious Folly? Come, gird thy loynes, prepare thee, play the Man; I will oppose thee: answer, if thou can. Why! Where wert Thou, tell (if thou know'st, dis-maid) When the Foundations of the Earth I laid? Who marked first the Measure of it out? Or (canst Thou tell) Who stretcht the Line about? What Bases had it; and fixt Where-upon? Or, Who thereof layd the first Corner-stone, When Morning-Stars for Ioy together sang, And all God's Children cheerfull eccho rang? Or, Who with Doores, shut-in the Sea so streight, When from the Womb it rushed with such weight? When as I made the Clowd a Clowt for it, And blackest Darkness as a Swathe-band fit: And Cradled it, in mine appointed place, With Bars about, and Doores at every pace: And sayd vnto it; Hitherto extend; And farther, not: Heer, thy proud Waues be pend. Hadst Thou the Morning from thy birth, at beck? Mad'st thou the Dawn in his due place to break; That it might reach the Earth's Circumference, And that the wicked might be shaken thence: To stamp it (various, as the Potters Clay) With many Formes, in manifold array, When as th'Vngodly shall be all descry'd; That Iustice hand may break the armes of Pride? Hast Thou gon down into the Sea it selfe; Walkt in the Bottom; searched every Shelfe; Survaid the Springs? Or have the Gates of Death Been opened to Thee; and those Dores beneath Death's gastly shadows? Know'st Thou (to conclude) (Tell, if thou know'st) the Earth's iust Latitude? Which is the way where louely Light doth dwell? And as for Darkness, where hath Shee her Cell; That Thou should'st Both, in both their bounds comprise; And know their dwellings, and their Paths, precise? Needs must Thou know them: Thou wert born yer than: No doubt Thou wert, Thou art so old a man. Hast Thou the Treasures of the Snow survay'd? Or seen the Store-house of my Hail (vp-layd And hid in heaps, against a time of need) For War-like Battry, where I haue decreed? Which is the way whence Lightning flasheth out, Scattering th'vnhealthy Eastern Gales about? Who hath dispos'd the vpper Spouts and Gutters, Whereby the Aire his over-burthen vtters? Or given the Lightning and the Thunder way, To cause it rain on places parcht away; On thirstie Desarts, where no People pass; On barren Mountains, to reviue the Grass? Had Rain a Father? Or, begot by whom Was pearly Deaw? Or, from what pregnant Womb Came crystall Ice? Or, canst Thou rightly render, Who did the hard and hoary Frosts ingender, When Waters creep vnder a Stone-like cover, And th'Oceans surface is thick-glased over? Canst Thou restrain the pleasant Influing Of Pleiades (the Vshers of the Spring)? Or, canst Thou lose Orion's Icie Bands (Who rules the Winter with his chill Commands)? Canst Thou bring forth (the soultry Summers Guide) Bright Mazaroth (or Dog-star) in his Tide? Or canst thou lead Arcturus (and his Train, Th'Autumnall Signes) his Sons or Charls his Wain)? Know'st Thou the Statutes of the Heav'ns aboue? Or canst Thou (here) them in their order moue? Wilt Thou command the Clowds, and Rain shall fall? Will Lightning come, and answer, at thy call? Who hath infus'd Wisedom in th'inner part? Or Vnderstanding who hath given the hart? Who can sum-vp the Clowds, or clear the Sky? Or ope Heav'ns bottles, when the Earth is dry? To steep the Dust, and knead the clotted Clay, Yerst over-baked with too-hot a Ray? Wilt Thou go hunt, th'old Lioness to help; Cap. 39. Or fetch-in prey to fill her greedy whelp, When they are couchant in their Den, or watch For passant Heards, their wonted Boot to catch? Who, for the Raven, provideth timely Food; When as her hungry greedy-gaping Brood, Wandring about, and wanting what to eat, Doe (croaking) call, and cry to Me for meat? Know'st Thou the time when mountain Goats and Hindes Doe yean and calue according to their Kindes)? Canst Thou keep reckning of the Months they go, And how their Burdens to their Birth-time grow; When they but bow them, and forthwith let fall Their tender Fruit, and all their Pains withall? Who hath sent out the Wilde Ass, free to feed; Or let him loose (from serving humane need) Whose house and haunt I haue ordaind express Within the brackie barren Wilderness? He scorns the Cities multitude and noyse: He reaks not of the yawning Drivers voyce: The craggy Cliffs his shaggy Pastures been; Where, off he croppeth what he findeth green. Will th'Vnicorn thee willingly obay? Or, will hee come vnto thy Crib, for Hay? Will he be brought to harrow or to plow? Or, will he bring thy Corn vnto thy Mow? Wilt Thou presume of Him, for strength in fight? Orleane to him, thy Labour to acquite? Didst Thou bestow the Peacocks goodly Fan? Or, gav'st Thou Feathers to the Stork (or Swan)? Or, to the Ostridge her delicious Tress (Th'ambitious Badge as well of War as Peace) Who layes her egges, and leaues them in the Dust, To hatch them there, with radiant Heat adust, Without her help, or heed; lest Tread or Track, Of Man or Beast them all to peeces crack: Vnkindest Dam, the labour of her wombe That dares annull; while Hers not Hers become: So void I made her of Intelligence, And kinde instinct of Natures Influence: Yet, with her Wings and Feet so fast she skips, That Shee the Horse and Rider both out-strips. Hast Thou indew'd the Horse with strengthfull wonder, And cloath'd his crest, and fill'd his brest with thunder? Canst Thou affright Him, as a Grass-hopper; Whose nostrils pride snorts Terrors every where? He pawes the Plain, he stately stamps, and neighs, And glad goes-on against the arm'd Arraies, Disdaining Fear. For, for the Sword and Shield, Dart, Pike, and Lance, He 'll not forsake the Field, Nor turn his back (how-ever thick they shiver) Nor for the Cross-bow, and the rattling Quiver. He swallowes-vp the Earth in furious heat; Nor will beleeue the Sound of the Retreat. Among the Trumpets, sounds his cheerfull Laugh, Ha-Ha-ha-ha: hee smelleth a far-off The wished Battaile; hears the thundring Call Of proud Commanders; and lowd Shouts of all. Is 't by thy wisedom that the Hawk doth mew, And to the Southward spreads her winged Clew? Doth th'Eagle mount so high at thy Behest, And build aloft (so neer the clowds) her Nest? Shee dwels vpon the Rock and ragged Cliffe, And craggy places the most steep and stiffe: From whence, about to seek her prey she flies; Which, from afar, her quick keen Sight espies: Her young ones also, onely Blood doo suck: And where the Slain are, thither doo they ruck. Cap. 40. Moreover, yet, The Lord, proceeding, said To Iob: Shall He that dares with God to plead, Teach Him His Part? Let him (who God doth tax) Heer let me hear the Answer that he makes. Iob sadly then Thus humbly did reply: O! Lord, behold; O! most-most Vile am I. What shall I answer Thee? What shall I say? Onely, my hand vpon my mouth I'll lay. Once haue I spoke, and twice; and too-too bold: But now, for ever I my Tongue will hold. Again, the Lord out of the Whirle-winde spake, And said to Iob: Yes, yes; thy Theam re-take: Gird vp thy loyns again, and play the Man: I'll question thee: now answer, if Thou can. Wilt Thou make voyd my Iudgements (iust and hie); Condemning Me, thy Selfe to iustifie? Hast thou an Arme like to the Arme divine? Or is Thy Voyce as Thunder-like as Mine? Put-on thy Robes of Maiestie and Might: Deck Thee with Glory, and with Bewty bright; Dart forth the Lightnings of thy wrathfull Frown, Against the Proud, and bring them tumbling down: Behold Thou all and every one that's Proud, And down with Them, and all the Wicked Croud: Trample vpon them, in their very Place: Hide them in Dust at once; there binde their Face: Then will I grant (what Thou hast vrg'd so braue) That thine owne Selfe thine owne right hand can saue. But, Now, behold (thy Fellow) Behemoth, Thy fellow Creature; for, I made you Both. He, like an Ox amid the Field doth graze: In's Loynes and Navell his most Strength he has: He whisks his sinnewie Taile, stiff as a Ceder; His Stones (within) with Nerues are wreathd together. His Bones and Ribs be strong as Brazen Bars, And as vnyeelding as the Iron-Spars: Hee's of the Master-peeces of the Lord, Who also arm'd him with a ready Sword. The Mountains yeeld him meat; where night and day, All other Beasts doo fear-less feed and play. Beneath the broad-leav'd shady Trees he lodges Amid the Fens, among the Reeds and Sedges, Compast with Willowes of the Brook about: Where, when he enters (in the time of Drought) The massie bulk of his huge bodie bayes The Torrents course, and even the Current stayes: There, yer he go, the River dry he drinks; And in his Thirst to swallow Iordan thinks. Dare any come, before him, Him to take, Or bore his Snout, of Him a Slaue to make? Canst Thou hale vp the huge Leviathan, Cap. 41. With hook and line amid the Ocean? Canst Thou his tongue with steely Crotchets thrill; Or with a Thorn his snuffing Nose, or Guill? Will He come sue, by Supplications, to-thee? Will He with smooth and soothing Speeches woo-thee? Will He by Covenant, serue thee, at thy beck; Or, be thy slaue, for ever at thy Check? Wilt Thou with Him, as with a Sparrow, play; And giue him, ty'd, vnto thy Girles, away? Shall Fisher-men of Him a Feast prepare? Shall They his flesh among the Marchants share? Canst Thou his skin with barbed pheons pearce? Or plant his Head with groues of Otter-spears? Lay hold on Him: set on him: but, before Think on the Battell, and come there no more. For, 'tis so farre from hope of Victory, That even His sight would rather make thee fly. There's none so fierce that dares Him rouze or hunt. [Then, Who shall safely Me my Selfe affront? Who hath prevented Me? To Whom haue I Been first beholding for a Curtesie, Or bound at all for any Benefit Bestow'd on Me, that I should guerdon it? Why? is not All Earths ample arms confine, All vnder Heav'n, All in the Ocean, Mine? I will not hide his Parts and Properties; Neither his Strength, nor seemly Symmetries. Who shall vnhood him? Who with double Rain Shall bridle him, with Snaffle, Trench, or Chain? Or put the Bit between his Iawes (his Portall) Impal'd with Terror of his Teeth so mortall? His Shield-like Scales, he chiefly glories in, So close compact, glew'd, sealed; that, between, No Aire can enter, nor no Engin pearce, Nor any Point dis-ioyne them or disperse. His Sneesings cause a Light, as brightly burning; His Eyes are like the Eye-lids of the Morning; Out of his Mouth flowe blazing Lamps, and flie Quick Sparks of Fire, ascending swift and hie: Out of his Nostrils, Smoak, as from a Pot, Kettle or Caldron when it boyleth hot: His Breath doth kindle Coals, when with the same He whirleth-out a Storm of Fume and Flame: Strength dwelleth in his Neck; so that he ioyes In saddest Storms, and triumphs of Annoyes: His Flakes of Flesh are solid to his Bone; His Heart's as hard as Wind-mils neather-stone. To see Him rise, and how he breaks withall; The stoutest stoop, and to their Prayers fall. No Weapons of Defence, or of Offence, Can Him offend, or from Him be Defence: Iron and Brasse He waighes as Sticks and Straw: Sling-stones and Arrowes Him do never aw: Darts daunt Him not, more then they Stubble were: He laugheth at the shaking of a Speare: Sharp ragged Stones, Keen-poynted Sherds and Shels, He resteth on, amid his muddy Cels. He makes the deep Sea like a Pot to boyl, A Pot of Oyntment (casting scummy Soyl): Where He hath past, he leaues vpon the streams A shining Path, and th'Ocean hoary seems. In Earth is Nothing like Him to be seen; So Fear-less made, so full of hawty Spleen; Despising all high things, Him-selfe beside. He is the King of all the Sons of Pride. Cap. 42. Iob, prostrate then, Thus to the Lord profest: Drad God, I know, and I acknowledge prest, That All Thou canst; and all Thou kennest too: Our Thoughts not hid; Thine owne not hard to doo. I am the Man, Who (to my self too-Holy) Darkned thy Counsells, with Contentious Folly. For, I haue spoken what I vnderstood not, Of wondrous things which comprehend I could not. Yet, Lord, vouchsafe, vouchsafe, I thee beseech, An Eare, and Answer to my humble Speech. Till now, mine Eare had only heard of Thee: But, now, mine Eye thy Gratious Selfe doth see. Therefore, My Selfe I loath, as too-too-bad; And heer repent in Dust and Ashes, sad. Now, after This with Iob; it came to passe, The Lord did also speake to Eliphaz The Thæmanite; and Thus to him said He: My wrath is kindled with thy Friends and Thee: For None of You haue spoken of My Path, So tight and iust as Iob my Seruant hath. Therefore go take you Rams and Bullocks faire, Seav'n of a sort; and to my Iob repaire; Bring for your Selues your Burnt Oblations due, And Iob my Seruant He shall pray for you, (For, Him will I accept) lest, Iustly-strict, After your Folly I reuenge inflict; Because You haue not spoken of my Path, So right and iust as Iob my Seruant hath. So Eliphaz, the ancient Thæmanite, Bildad the Shuhite, the Naamathite Zophar (together) them prepar'd and went And did according God's Commandement. Also the Lord accepted Iob, and staid His Thral-full State (when for his Friends he praid) And turned it to Solace-full, from sad; And gaue him double all the Goods he had. Then all his Brethren, Sisters all, and Kin; And all that had of his acquaintance bin, Came flocking to his House, with him to feast; To wail his Woes, and comfort him their best, For all the Euill which the Lord (of late) Had brought vpon his Person and his state. And Each man gaue him (as best beare they could) A peece of Money and Ear-ring of Gold. So, that the Lord blessed Iob's later Time, With more abundance then his flowry Prime. For, Fourteen Thousand Sheep were now his flock; Camels six Thousand; Steers a Thousand yoak; Shee-Asses twice fiue Hundred; Familie Iust as before: Seuen Sons, and Daughters Three. Th'Eldest Iemima, Kezia the Next: And Keren-Happuch (saith my sacred Text) The Third he named (Names of goodly Sense, Alluding to some Gracefull Excellence: The first, as much as Lustre of the Morn; Cassia, the Next; last, Albastrine Horn) In all the Countrey were no Women found So faire as These. Iob, of his Goods and Ground, Among their Brethren gaue them Heritage. Yet, after This, Iob liv'd a goodly age, Twice Seauenty yeers, and saw his Sons Sons Sons, Successiuely, Four Generations: And then He dy'd, Ancient and Full of Dayes. To GOD, for Him, and all his Saints, be Praise, And for his Succour in These sacred Layes. AMEN. VVho, SELF, The World, &amp; Satan, triumphto're; Who, Wealth's &amp; Health's &amp; Children's rufull, Losse; Who, Frends Rebuke, Foes rage, Wifes cursing Crosse; Hevns Frowne, Earth's force, Hels Furie, Calmely bore: Th'Inuincible in Vertue, IOB, Her Pheere, The Virgin Patience (Widow now) toomb'd Heer.

BETHVLIANS RESCVE. The First Booke. I sing the Vertues and the valiant Deed Of th'Hebrew Widow, that so brauely freed Bethulian Doores from Babylonians Dread, And with iust Fauchin did behead their Head. Thou, that to saue, from Pagans seruile Rigor, Thine Isaac's Heirs, didst steele with manly vigor Weake Ivdith's hart, my feeble hart aduance; Raise, raise my Thoughts in high and holy Transe: Vpon my Spirit, O! let thy Spirit reflect: Grant I may handle in a stile select So sacred Stuff; that whoso reads This Story, May Profit reap, I Comfort, and Thou Glory. And You great Comfort of Great-Britan's King, Whose Vertues here I vnder Ivdith sing; Thrice-royall Anne, vouchsafe auspicious Rayes Of Princely Fauour on These Pious Layes (Compos'd first vpon a Queen's Command, Disposed next into a Queen's on ne hand, Transposed now to a more Queen's Protection: As most peculiar to all Queen's Perfection.) Great-gracious Lady, let it not distaste, That Ivdith made not (as she ought) more haste To kisse Your Hands; nor deeme, nor doubt, the worst, Though Shee haue seen Your Royall Spouse the first: It was her Truch-man, much against Her minde, Betrayd her so to goe against Her Kinde. For which Offence, with other mo, to Her, Sh' hath got her now a new Interpreter; Shee hopes, more faithfull (wishes, more discreet) To say and lay Her Seruice at Your Feet: To giue Du Bartas (at the last) His Due, In Her behalfe; and in Her, honour You. While Israel a happy Peace inioyd, And, dangerlesse, with diligence imployd The fruitfull Soile, which seuenty yeeres vnsow'n Had ly'n before, with Thistles over-grow'n; The Lord, Who often, by some Stroak seuere Of iust Correction, wakes his Owne (for feare Least too-long Resting make them like the Horse, Which standing still too-long, doth lose his Force, Forgets to manege; and, too-pamperd, growes Vnruly, restiue; and his Rider throwes) Covers their Country with so huge an Hoste, That clowds of Arrowes darkned all the Coast, Pikes, Bills and Darts, seemd, as they stirr'd, or stood, A moouing Forest, or a mighty Wood: And, of all sorts of Souldiers, rankly-rude, Vnder their Ensignes marcht such multitude, As euen drew dry the Rivers where they past Through rich Iudea; so that, at the last, Cleer Iordan's Selfe, in his dry oazie Bed, Blushing for shame, was fain to hide his head; Because (flat Bankrupt) hee no more could pay One Tribute-stream, of all hee ought the Sea. The sun-burnt Reaper had yet scarcely rid The ridged Acres of their richest Weed: The needie Gleaner scarce had gathred clean The scatterd Ears the Binder left, to glean: And scarce, as yet the Flayls vpon the Floores Began to groan: When Iacob at his Doors, Sees Holofernes his weak Frontires spoile; In bloudy Rivers drowne his fertile Soile; Not sparing fel the tender Female-kind, Nor hoarie haires (already short confin'd) Nor Sucklings, swaddled in their Mothers arms, From insolence of his insulting Arms. Then, as a Flock of Sheep, which sees their Foe Come forth a Wood (who oft hath scar'd them so) Minds no Defence; but, scudding to be gon, Makes, in an instant, hundred Flocks of one: Th'Isaacians seized with a suddain Feare, Thinking his Hoast behind them euery where, Disperst and scatterd (like those silly Sheep) Fly into Woods, in Rocks and Caues they creep. Th'affrighted Swaines, neglecting Fields and Flocks, To saue their liues, clime steepest Hills and Rocks: Artificers, leauing their Tooles to play, Gain-greedy Chap-men, laying Trades away, Hie them to hide them, in securer sort In mossie Caues, then in a martiall Fort. And greatest Lords hold Denns of Wolues and Bears A safer Hold then Gold-lyn'd Walls of theirs. Feare, lending wings to th'Aged, makes them ply With lustie speed vp to the Mountains nigh: Feare makes the Mother, all forlorn and lost, Lug their deer Cradles to the Clowds almost: Fear makes the Children (like so many Lambs) Craule on all foure after their dabbled Dams: Ther's nothing heard but hideous Cryes and Plaints, Sad Lamentations, pitifull Complaints. O Lord! (say they) wilt thou, for euer, Thus Thrill down the Darts of thy fierce Wrath on vs? Shall the Chaldean Idolists again Thy Chosen Flock in seruile Yoak enchain? Shall our sad Houses, turnd to Heaps of stone, With Weeds and Thorns again be ouer-grow'n? Shall sacrilegious Fire again presume Thy sacred House, thine Altar to consume? But Ioachim, High-Priest of God, that tide, And of the Hebrews then the chiefest Guide, Followes the stout and expert Pilots guise, Who, when hee sees a suddain Storm arise, Adds not more Feare, with His Feare, to his fellowes, Nor leaues his Ship to mercy of the Billowes; But, hiding his distrust, opposes braue His Arm and Art against the Winde and Waue: For, quick dispatching (hourely) Post on Post, To all the Coverts of the Able-most For Pate, Prowes, Purse; commands, prayes, presses them To come with speed vnto Iervsalem. Since first th'Eternall gaue his sacred Law, Vpon Mount Sinai (in so dreadfull Awe) Th'Ark, which contained, in Two leaues of stone, Much more sound Wisedom, in it selfe alone; Then subtile Greece, or Rome (renownd for Wise) In Worlds of Volumes euer could comprise; Wandred from Tribe to Tribe, from Race to Race, Throughout all Iury, without Resting-place, Yea, somtimes too (O too audacious Theft!) The sacrilegious Philistins it reft: Till th'happy day when Iesse's holy Stem Lodg'd it for euer, in Iervsalem. But, sith as yet, great Dauids hands were red With bloud of Thousands he had slaughtered; The King of Peace would haue a peacefull Prince In Peacefull dayes, with all Magnificence To build his Temple; whose high Battlement Seemd Earth to scorne, and threat the Firmanent, Till th'hapless Day wherein a hatefull King (In name and nature, iust resembling This Tyrant's Lord) with execrable Blaze, Did burne it downe, and the Foundation raze. A long-while after, Abr'ham's sacred Stems, Returnd from Shores of Tyrant Tygris streams; Beset with Fears, with Perill, and with Pain, Re-builded Heer God's glorious House again. Which, though (alas!) That first no more it matcht, Then a Kings Palace a poore Cottage thatcht; In Bignes yet, Beauty, and Height, obscur'd All Pagan Wonders which most Fame procur'd; Th'Assyrian Queen-king's (sometime) sumptuous Bowers, Th'Ephesian Temple, the Egyptian Towers, The Pharians Pharus, Carians costly Toomb, Rhodes high Colossus, the huge Heaps of Rome— For, for admired Art, This glorious Temple Seru'd Ctesiphon for Model and Example; Lent rare Apelles curious Pensill Light, And led Lycippus cunning Chizel right. Thither by Troops, th'Isaacian Tribes deuout, Returnd to Salem slockt from all about: As, when the Heav'ns, opening their Sluces wide, Poure suddain Showers, surrounding euery side; The gurgling Rills with rapid Course descend From sundry Hills, and to some Riuer tend. But, sad-sweet Ivdith in the midst (almost) Shined as Cynthia 'mid the Nightly Hoast: For, God (it seem'd) her Beauties Form had cast In rarest Mould of Nature (first or last). Th'High Primate then, assisted with the Ligne Of Eleazar (Priests, whose sacred Crine Felt neuer Razor) on his oyled head A pearly Mirre sadly setteled; His sacred Body also soon hee heals With sacred Vesture, fring'd with golden Bells: Then burns for Offring, slayes for Sacrifice, Kidds, Lambs, Calues, Heifers, in abundant wise; Th'horns of the Altar with their blood bedying, And lowely-lowd, thus to th'Almighty crying: Wee come not heere, O dreadfull Lord of Hoasts, To plead a Roule of Meritorious Boasts; Nor to protest, that, in these Punishments, Thou wrongst thy Iustice, and our Innocence: No; wee confesse, our foule and frequent Crimes Worthy worse Plagues then these, a thousand times; Could'st thou forget Thy deer authentik Pact With Abraham, or would'st thou (so exact) Forcing thy Mercy in thy Iustice Scale, Our Waight of Sins with Iudgements countervaile. Remoue our Cause, wee therefore (Lord) intreat, From Iustice Barr, vnto thy Mercy-Seat: O! holy Father, pardon vs (wee pray) And turn from vs this fearfull Storm away. Alas! what boots vs, that thy mighty hand Hath brought vs home from Tigris hatefull strand, Free from the Yoak, which wee so long (before) Vnder th'Assyrian cruell Tyrants bore; If these fat Fields, we haue but new re-tild, If these faire Frames, we doe but now re-build, If these (O Dolor!) our deere louing Wiues, Our Babes, Sons, Daughters (deerer then our liues) Must serue the Chaldes, Ammonites for Pay, And be the Persians and fel Parthians Prey; If This thine Altar, if these hallowed rooms, Be re-profan'd with Heathen Hecatombs? O! if thou wilt not pittie Vs, abhord; At least, be Iealous of Thy Glory, Lord: At least, haue pitty on This Holy Place, Where, to no God, but to Iehova's Grace, Is Incense burnt, nor any Sacrifice, But to thy Selfe, of all the Deities. Lord! therefore turn, O turn the Chaldean Torches From these rich Cedar Roofs, these stately Porches: Preserue these Plates, this pretious Furniture, From sacrilegious Pilferers impure: And let our Sorrow, and our Sacrifice, Vnto thy Iustice, for our Sinnes suffice. The Seruice done, Each doth his way depart, And Ioachim instantly calls apart The States of Iuda; and thus, sadly-sweet, Consults with Them, how with this Storm to meet. Graue Peers (said he) if your braue Zeale, of old, Be not quite quenched, be not yet key-cold: If Care of Wiues, if tender Childrens loue, Had euer Power Your Soules deer Soules to moue: If in your Brests rests any noble Worth, Now, now or neuer, bring it, brauely forth: For, but God aide, and your auspicious Speed, Wee are vndone, Wee and our wretched Seed: And neuer more shall the Immortall see This Altar Smoaking to his Maiestie. While th'Aire is mute, so that it scarce can make, In Summer dayes, an Aspen leafe to shake: While Seas be calm, so that, with Streamers braue, A thousand Saile slide on the sleeping Waue: While all the Winds be mew'd vp in their Cell, 'Tis hard to say, which Pilot doth excell. But, when a Tempest, one-while sinks a Ship Down to the Bottom of th'infernall Deep; Another-while, with swelling Fury driuen, Tilts with her Tops against the Stars of Heav'n; Raking a Shelfe now, and a Rock anon; Then, and but then, is a Good Maister know'n. Therefore (alas!) let now no carnall Care Of goods, liues, honors (for your priuate Share) Make you forget your Common-Country's Loue, This Sacred Place, th'Honor of God aboue: But humbly all into His hands resigning Your Soules whole Sway, and all your Spirits refining In sacred Flame, from Drosse and Mists impure, Which too-too-oft the cleerest Eyes obscure; Aduise (I pray) the best, in likely-hood, Most pleasing God, most for the Publique Good. An aged Traytor then, whose breath distill'd Sweet Hony Words whose brest with Gall was filld, VVringing false Tears from his dissembling Eyes, His cursed Drift did in These Tearms disguise: My Spirits faint, my Speech doth faile me quight, My frostie haires for horror stand vpright, When I consider how This Tyrant fel, With Bloud-floods drowning where he coms to quell, Drawes neer Vs; threatning to our Houses Flames, Death to our Selues, dishonor to our Dames: But, when (on th'other side) to minde I call This mighty Princes milde Receipt of All (Not only such, as, rude and Reason-less, Serue (like him Selfe (dumb Idols) Blockes, and Beasts: But such, as matching our Zeal's holy Heighth, Are Abrah'ms Seed, both in their Flesh and Faith; Which wisely haue (and timely) turn'd (submiss) The deadly Edge of his drad Vengeances) I praise the Lord for such a Foe; so meek To yielding Lambes, to Lyons Lyon-like; As flexible to humble Tears, as fel To Resolutions that (in vain) rebell. Sith therefore, yet we may haue Choise (for Iurie) Of War, or Peace, his Fauor, or his Furie; Winking in Dangers, let's not VVilfully Follow our Fathers stubborn Sur-cuidry: But, striking Saile in such Storms violence, Let's liue secure vnder so good a Prince. Yet, None mis-take, that I this Counsaile giue, To saue my Stake, as one too-faine to liue: Alas! my Years are of them Selues of age To dye alone, without Assyrians Rage; Without the help of their keen Dart or Pole, To launce my Hart, or to let out my Soule: Where, were my Youth's Spring now re-flowr'd again, And heatefull blood boyling in euery vein, My Zeale to GOD, and to my Country's Good Should shew me well no Niggard of my blood, Might (Samson-like) My Death bring Death to all The Pagan Hoast and their proud General. But, more I feare, least, with a Zeal too-Yong, We, fighting for the Law, the Law impugne; Inciting so the Soldiers Insolence, Incensing so the Fury of the Prince, That they by Conquest of one Day vndoo Deer Izrael, and drown GOD's Glory too. For, Wee bereft, What People, in This Place, Truly-religious shal implore His grace? Who, of all Nations that dispersed, Wun From Shores of Indus, to the Setting Sun; And from the farthest Hyperborean Coasts, To those whose Clime continuall Summer roasts, Hath chosen only Iacob for his Owne, And on This Mount His drad-deer Glory showne. But, good old Cambris (else the mildest Prince) Groanes, griev'd and pale with Passions vehemence; And, interrupting That, with This Discourse Hartens the heartless Peers and Counsellors: Rather, O Earth (for which our Earthlings strive) Gape vnder me and swallow Me alive: Rather, iust Heav'ns, with sulphury Fire and Fume (As Sodom yerst) Me sodainly consume, Than I should (Saint with-out, within Malitious) Give Izrael a Counsail so pernicious. Were it, the Head of this inhumane Band Meant but our Bodies only to command, Though with our Birth, to this faire Light we brought Sweet Liberty (so sweet and deer, that nought, No Hopes, no Heaps may be compar'd to it:) The Temple sav'd, I might perhaps submit. But, sith this Tyrant, puft with foolish Pride, With heavier Gyves to load our Soules (beside) Which (only Vassals of the Thunder-Thrower) Nor knowe, nor owe, to Any Sceptres lower; Would that (forgetting Him who made vs All, And of all People chose vs principall, And fatherly provides vs every thing, And shields vs ay with Shadow of his wing) We take for GOD, His proud ambitious Prince, VVho Nimrod-like, with hellish Insolence, Would climbe to Heav'n, although his life be such, As merits not the Name of Man, by much. Let's beard him boldly, bravely stand we to't, Arms against Arms, Man to Man, Foot to Foot. Victory lies not in vain-glorious hearts, Number of Horses, nor of Pikes, and Darts: These be but Instruments th'Eternal moves, To crown with Conquest whom his Goodnes loves. Yet, should the Lord now suffer Heathen's rage To over-run his sacred Heritage, Because in life his Name we so dishonour; In Death, at least, in Death, let's doo him Honor: And, if we cannot Assur over-come, Let's win, by Patience, Crowns of Martyrdom. And, could, our Foes (as fel as Lestrigons) From off the Earth extirp our Tribes at-once; They could not though GOD's glorious Name interr (As these Apostates falsly would inferr). For, He that with so sundry Nations stor'd Th'vnpeopled World, from one Man; and restor'd (Long after that) by one smal Bark the waste The Flood had made, when it had All defaç't; Is not He able even of stones to raise A People Zealous of his glorious Praise? Is not He able once again to ope Old Sara's Wombe, and giue her Spouse (past hope) More Sonnes, then Sands on Lybian shores be cast, By ruffling Boreas, lowd, Cloud-chasing Blast; Or twinkling Spangles nightly brightly roule On sabled Circles of the whirling Pole: Which, with more sacred Voice, more humble Awe, Shall sound his Praises, and observe his Law? Then rather, Fathers (foule befall You else) Let vs die Hebrews, then liue Infidels. Let's not preferre, too-base, and too-too-blame, Profit to Duty, idle Feare to Shame. Cambris Oration was no sooner done, But all th'Assembly (as all ioyn'd in one) Confirm'd His Counsail both with voice and gest: And Ioachim, (Ioy-rapt, above the rest) Lifting to Heav'n-ward reverent hands and face, Said, Lord wee thank thee, that thy speciall grace Hath steeld our hearts, and linkt our Wils no less: A hopefull Signe of happy good Successe. Then, to the Princes he the Charge commits Of Townes and Provinces, as Each befits: Lest any, spurr'd by Envie or Ambition, In Izrael should kindle new Sedition. So, Each with-drawes, and bravely-bold prepares To front the worst that martiall Fury dares. Who th'Arist'æan busie Swarmes hath seen On Hybla's Top; Whether, with Launcets keen, Charging the Drones which over-neer their homes Come humming out to rob their fragrant Combes: Whether, collecting their delicious Deaw From various Thyme, and other Flowers not few: Whether, extending, in rare Symmetrie, With wondrous Art, their Waxen Canapey; And arching even, so many Thousand Cells, So quick, so thick; so like, as Nothing else: Whether, conducting their too-full Supplies Els-where, to plant their goodly Colonies; Which keep, still constant, in their new Plantation, Their Mother Citie's Manners, Lawes, and Fashion: Hath seen the Iewes as busie Diligence, And quick Desire to put them in Defence. Some stop the Breaches made by Art or Age; By the Heav'ns anger, or the Heathens rage: Some, lest the Ram, butting with boisterous Fals, Should pash to powder their too-feeble Wals, With Bastions, Bulwarks, Rampiers, Ravelins, Forts, Flank on all sides their Cities where imports: Some to and fro trudging with Baskets fill'd, In places needfull sodain Sconces build: Some wanting time, or meanes their Town to wall, With broad deep Trenches soon begirt it all: And from a River neer they cut a Rill The hollow bosom of their Dike to fill. While Armorers, in order, beating quick Hot sparkling Steel on Anvils hard and thick, Transform it soon to Corslets, Curtellaxes, Helms, Gorgets, Gantlets, Bills and Battail-axes; And some, for need (to furnish and set-out Th'vntrained Shepheard, Neatheard, and the Lowt) Ground the ground-slycing Coultar to a Blade, And of the Sickle a straight Weapon made: None Yong and healthy took Repast or Rest: One on his back, another on his Beast, Others in Waggons carryed-in apace Corn, Wine, and Food to some importing Place: Even so, in Summer (as the Wise-man tels) Th'Emmets by Troupes haste from their hollow Cels To get-in Harvest graving where they gone Their Diligence even in a path of Stone: The lustiest Swarmes for their Provision range, The sick and old wait at their thrifty Grange T'vnloade the Burthens, and lay-vp their Store In their great Garnier byting yet before Of every Graine, least kept so warme belowe Amid the Molde, it after sprout and growe. The end of the first Booke. The Second Booke. Now Holofernes in the Scythick Fort. Had pight his Standards; and in various Sport His Youthfull Pagans did them still delight; Nought less expecting then Affront, or Fight: When he had newes, The Iewes stood brauely out, Defy'd his Pride, and fortifi'd about. Shall then (said He) shall then a sort of Slaves, A sort of Clownes &amp; Shepheards, arm'd with Staves, With Slings and Stones, presume to stop the Course Of Mine exploits: Which, nor the roaring scource Of rapid Tigris and swift Euphrates, Nor snowie Tops of Taure and Niphatés, Conspir'd, could stay? You Chiefs of Moabites, Of valiant Ephraim, and fierce Ammonites; You that as Neighbours (hauing long converst) Knowe all the Nations on these Hills disperst, Say, from what People had they their Descent? What lies their Strength in? What's their Gouernment? For, He that wisely knowes his Foe (they say) Hath, in a manner gotten half the Day. Then Ammon's Prince, bending his humble knee, Thus to the Duke reply'd right prudently (For though in hart a Pagan, born and bred; Against his Minde, his Tongue diuinely led By that same Spirit which did the Se'er compell, Which came to curse, to blesse his Izrael; Of th'Hebrewes State did such Relation make, As if in Him Moses and Esdras spake;) My Lord, I shall, sith You so please, recite Th'Isacians Story; and will follow right Th'ingenious Bees, which wont not to devoure All Sweet they meet, nor suck of every Flower; But even of those they chuse, take but the Crops. This People (Sir) vpon the Mountaine Tops Encamped heere, originally came From forth the Loines of famous Abraham, Who, to obey the GOD of Gods, most High Maker of All; of All Support, Supply; Came to This Countrey (then, in Occupation Of Cananites, the rich and native Nation) Where that same GOD not only heaps with Gold And Goods, his House; but also (though He old An hundred years; a third part lesse, his Wife; And, till that season, barren all her life) Sent him a Son; swearing, His seed should sway: Triumphant Sceptres many, many a-day: But, when good Abraham's old-old Age expects This happy Promise in the sweet effects, Th'Immortall Voice (O pitiòus Mysteries!) Commands that He his Isaac sacrifice. Euen as a Ship, vpon the raging Sea Between Two Windes Cross-tossed euery-way, Vncertain knowes not in what Course to set-her, Till one of them, striving to get the better, Doubles his bellowes, and with boisterous blast Driues her (at random) where he list, at last: So, the Hebrew, feeling in-ward War (that season) T'wixt Loue and Duty, betwixt Faith and Reason, Doubts what to doo; and his Perplexities Leane now to that hand, and anon to this: Til th'heav'nly loue he ought his GOD had won The earthly love he bore his only Son. Then, having ready Fire and Fagot laid, And on the Altar his deer Son displayd; The knife he drawes with trembling hand, and had Even heav'd his arme about to strike the Lad, When GOD, in th'instant staies the Instrument Ready to fall on th'humble Innocent: As satisfied with so sufficient Trial Of Abraham's Faith; to Him his GOD so loyal. From Isaac, Iacob; and from Iacob sprung Twelue sturdy Sons; who with sore Famine wrung, Forsaking Canaan, for a great-good-while Had happy Biding by the Banks of Nile: Where their blest Issue multiply'd so fast, That they became th'Egyptian's Feare, at last: Yea, though (alas!) their bodies had no rest, And though their backs with burthens were opprest; Like noble Palm-Trees, mounting stifly-strait, The more, the more, they be surcharg'd with waight. Therfore the Tyrant which then held the Raines Of that rich Soile where sad Heav'n never raines, Commands that all male Hebrew Infants found (Poore Innocents!) be quickly kill'd, or drown'd, As soon as Wombes had them delivered; That one same day might see them born and dead. O Tiger! thinkst thou? thinks that Rage of thine To cut-off quite Isaac's Immortall Ligne? Well may it reave the scarce-born Life of those New-hatched Babes, and them of Light fore-close: But notwithstanding, Iacob's swarming Race Within few Years shall cover Canaan's Face; And, thine owne Issue even the first shall be To break (and iustly) thine vniust Decree. Pharoa's faire Daughter, with a noble Train, For Blood and Beauty rarely matcht again, One Evening, bathing in the Crystall Brook Which thorough Gossen crawls with many a Crook, Hears in the reeds a ruefull Infants voyce; But thinking it some of the Hebrewes Boyes (As 'twas indeed) her Fathers bloody Law Stopt for a while her tender eares with Awe. But, at the last, marking the Infants face (I woat not what vnvsuall Tracts of Grace And Types of Greatnes sweetly shining there) Love vanquisht Duty, Pity conquer'd Feare: For, She not only takes him vp from thence, But brings him vp, and breeds him as a Prince, Yea, as Her owne. O Babe belov'd of God! O Babe ordain'd to lighten th'Hebrew's Load! To lead their Bodies, to direct their Mindes: First, best most Wrighter, in all sacred Kindes: Thou hadst but now no Mother (to be seen) And now for Mother, Thou hast found a Queen. Lo, thus (my Lord) could their wise God extract Good out of Euill, and convert the act Of Persecution (bent against the blood And Life of His) vnto their greater good. So Ioseph's Brethren, by their Envious Drift To ouer-throwe him, to a Throne him lift: So did proud Haman's deadly Hatred, lend Sad Mordecay a Ladder to ascend To Honors Top, and trimd his neck (past Hope) With gracefull Chain, in steed of shamefull Rope. One day, this Hebrew, driving Iethro's Sheep Vpon Mount Horeb (where he vs'd to keep) Sawe on the sodaine a bright blazing Flame Burne in a Bush, and yet not burne the same; From whence, anon he heard (with Fear and Wonder) A Voice, might shake both Heav'n and Earth in sunder. I, I that (only), Am-Was-Shal-Be, Who Made All of Nothing; and can All vn-doo, When pleaseth Me: I-Am, The Holy-One, The Great, The Good, The Iust; Whose hand alone Sustaines, maintaines, and rules the World: I-Am, Th'Omni-potent, The GOD of Abraham; Fierce to my Foes with my Revenging Rod: But vnto Those that worship Me for GOD, Me sole, and whole in Thought, in Word, and Deed, Most Mercifull; to Them and all their Seed. Then doo my Will: dispatch thee speedy hence; Go, say from Mee, to that vnhallowed Prince Which ruleth Memphis, and the fertile Plaine Where swelling Nilus serves in steed of Rain, That he dismisse my People: and lest He, Incredulous, distrust thine Embassie; Cast-down thy Rod, thy Message to confirm: It to a Serpent shall eft-soons transform. He throwes it down, and instantly withall Sees it begin to liue, to move, to craule, With hideous head before, and tail behinde, And body wriggling (after Creepers kinde). Re-take it vp, his GOD commands him then; Which, taken, takes the former Form agen: And, past Mans Reason (by the power of GOD) Of Rod turns Serpent, and of Serpent Rod. Arm'd with this Wand, wherewith he was to quel The sceptred Pride of many an Infidel, He many a time importunes Pharao, In GOD's great Name, to let the Hebrews go Into the Desart, at their liberties To serve the Lord, and offer Sacrifice. But Pharao, deaf vnto his sacred Word, Stifly withstands the Message of the Lord: Who then, by Moses working many Miracles, Authorized His Orator and Oracles. First, He not only turned into Blood Nile's seav'n-fold VVaves, and every other Flood That fattens Egypt; but euen every Spring, Whose captive Crystall, golden Pipes do bring To serve the Court: so that the King is forç't With that red liquor to allay his Thirst. Then, from the Fens, from puddly Ponds and Lakes Millions of Millions of foule Frogges he makes To cover Memphis with their ougly Frie, And not forbeare the Kings owne Canapy. Then, of all Ages, of all sorts, and sexes, With burning Vlcers, and hot Biles he vexes; So that th'Egyptians, in vncessant anguish, Of vnknow'n Poyson, on their Couches languish: Nor can their Leaches their owne Leaches be, In their vnheard-of, hidden Malady. Then on their Cattle; Flocks, and Heards, and Droves In Downes and Dales, Fens, Forrests, Fields and Groues, A strong Contagion suddainly he spred; Which took so quickly both their heart and head, That silly Shepheards neer the Rivers side, Their Cattle dead, sooner then sicke, espi'd. Then turns the Earths Dust into Swarmes of Lice: Then dims the Aier with dusky Clouds of Flies, Of Drones, Wasps, Homers, humming day and night In every place, with every face to fight, And fixing deep in every Pagans skin Th'vnvsual anger of their steeled Pin. Then (when appeer'd no Threat of troubled Aier, No signe of Tempest) at his Servants Prayer Th'Eternall thundred down such Storms of Hail, As with the noise and stroak did stoutest quail: Heer falls a Bul, brain'd with a Hail-stones rap; There sprawles a Childe, split with a Thunder-Clap: Heer a huge Forrest, lately all a Clowd Of tufted Armes, hath neither Shade nor Shrowd: And, if the native Sap again re-suit The naked Trees with comely Leaues and Fruit, Again (alas!) the Caterpiller crops, Within few houres, the Husbands yearely hopes. Then with gross Darknes vailing close the Skies, He so field-vp stubborn Egyptians eyes, That for three dayes with fearfull foot and hand They groapt their way (except in Gossen-land): And Titan, tir'd in his long Course, for ease, Seem'd then to rest him with th'Antipodes. But, as the same Sun, the same instant, makes The Mud to harden; and to melt, the Wax; So had These Works, so full of admiration, On diuers Subiects, diuerse Operation. The humble Hebrews, God's great hand adore; But wilfull Pharao spurns it more and more: Euen as a Corselet, when 'tis cold enough, The more 'tis beaten growes the harder Proofe. Yet, at the sad Newes of the Prince, His Son, And all their Heires, all in one Night vndone; Hee was so daunted, that he early bod The Hebrews goe to serue the Lord their God: Who, in a Piller of a Clowd by Day, Of Fire, by Night, directed right their Way. But, soon retracting his extorted Grant, The stubborn Tyrant strangely arrogant, Arms all his Egypt, and in post pursews The Arm-lesse Legions of the harm-lesse Iews, Then lodg'd secure along the sandy shore, Where the Erythræan ruddy Billowes rore. Was not such Noise, when, tearing Gibraltar, Th'Herculian Sea came first to spred so far Twixt Calpe and Abile; nor when Oenotrie Sad-sighing lost her deer neer Trinacrie; As in both Armies: Th'one insulting proud; Th'other in skrieches, and sad cryes, as lowd, Deafned the Shores: while Fifes, Horns, furious Horse, With Noise and Neighes, did euen the VVelkin force. Cursed Seducer (cry'd the Iewes) what Spight Moou'd thee to alter our Liues happy plight? What! are we Fishes that we heere should swim Through these deep Seas? Or, are we Fowls to skim Ouer the steepest of these Mountains tall? Were there not Graues in Egypt for vs all? In our deer Gossen? but wee needs must come In this Red-Sea to seeke our rewfull Tombe? Yet, mildest Moses, with his dead-liue Wand, Strikes th'awfull Streams: which, yielding to his hand, Discouer Sands the Sun had neuer spy'd, And Walld the same with Waues on either side: Between the which (dread-less and danger-less) The Hebrews dry-shod past the Crimsin Seas. But, when the Tyrant rashly them pursues, Marching the Way was made but for the Iewes; The Sea returns, and over-turns his Force, Him Selfe, his Men, his Chariots, and his Horse. O happy People, for whom God (so kind) Arms Fire, and Aire, and Clowds, and Waues, and Wind! Whom All things serue: which hast All things in Pay, O! neuer let Time's File to fret away So rare a Fauour? rather let the Tongue Of All thine Aged tell it to Their Yong; They to their Seed, and They to theirs again; Eternally These Wonders to retaine. Them, forty yeers, God in the Desart fed With Angells Food, with a celestiall Bread; And from a Rock (as dry as Pumice first) Made Riuers gush, to satisfie their Thirst: Kept (euen) their Shooes, and all their Garments there, As good, the last, as the first day they were: And, sith our Soules will faint for want of Food, Most liberall in All, for all their Good, Gaue (on Mount Sinai) in his Sacred Lawe, Soule to their Soules, through sharp-sweet filial Awe: Teaching them all (as dutie All doth binde) To loue Him first, and next to Him, Man-kinde; That We might neuer break That sacred Twine Which Man to Man, and Man to God doth ioyne. Graue Mases dead, braue Iosuah's rule began; Whose happy Sword soon conquered Canaan; And in fewe yeeres into subiection brings The Liues and States of one and thirty Kings. At His command, more powerfull then the Thunder, The firmest Rocks and Rampiers fall in-sunder; Without the Shock of Tortoise or of Ram, To batter Breaches where his Armie came: For, but with bellowing of hoarse Trumps of Horn, As with an Engine, prowdest Towers are torn: As at his Beck, the Heav'ns obey his will; The Fire-foot Coursers of the Sun stand still, To lengthen Day, lest vnder wings of Night, His Heathen Foes should saue themselues by Flight. This scourge of Pagans, in a good old age (To liue in Heav'n) leauing this Earthly Stage, Israel had many Magistrates of Name, Whose Memories liue euer fresh in Fame. Who knowes not Ahud, Sangar, Samuel, Debora, Barac, and Othoniel? Who hath not heard of mighty Samsons Coile, Who, sole, and Arm-less, did an Army foile? What Praise with Iepthe's might haue wel compar'd Had but his Rashnes his deer Daughter spar'd? VVhat Clime, what Time, what Riuer, Dale or Down But rings of Gedeon, and his high Renown? After the Iudges; Kings (some good, some bad) The sacred Helm of th'Hebrew Vessell had: Had I their Dauid's holy Harp and Skill, Nothing but Dauid would I warble still: But as (my Lord great Dauid's Deeds, could none (Yer-while) atchieue, but Dauid's Selfe alone; Can none but Dauid's Harp, and Dauid's Hymne Resound aright the Honors due to Him: I will not therefore, with vnworthy Layes, Seeming to praise him, derogate his Praise. But, shall I balk his Son, whom Heav'ns adorn With Health, Wealth, Wisedom, and All-Plenties horn: Whose prudent Problems, touching euery Theam, Draw thousand Sophists to Iervsalem, Arabians, Indians, Africans, among; Chain'd by the Charms of his All-Skilfull Tongue? Or Him, whose Zeale the Idols so defac't; Re-purg'd God's Temple, and his Rites re-plac't? Or Him, that sawe a heau'nly Hoast descend To succour Sion, and his Foes offend? Or Him, whose Army, neer to Gerar, yerst, Proud Ethyopians swarming Troops disperst? Or Him, who praying for Heav'ns aide, to fight 'Gainst Ammon, Moab, and Mount-Sëirite; Saw, dy Themselues, his sad Request ful-filld, When, Self-incenst, Them-Selues they enter-killd? But Chaldei's King, by Their's Captiuity, Put (late) an End vnto That Monarchy. Yet did Great Cyrus Them again restore To Liberty; and gaue them furthermore Leaue to elect Two Rulers of their Race: Whereof the One (who yet supplies the place) Was Ioachim; who, for his holy Life, Prowesse, and Prudence, is respected rife, Not sole in Sion; but with Ammonites, Syrians, Sydonians, Madians, Moabites. Thus was (my Lord) the Prime, this the Progression, Of Israel, through euery Times succession: And Thus the Lord hath lift them (nigh) to Heau'n Som-times; som-times, them (euen) to Hell hath driv'n. But, whether Princely-Priest, or Iudge, or King, Of th'Hebrew Tribes haue had the Gouerning; So long as They obseru'd the sacred Pact God with their Fathers did by Oath contract; Ay prosperous, tryumphantly they troad On proudest Foes: and all the World abroad, Conspir'd in Spight, could nothing Them annoy, Much lesse distract them; least of all, destroy: On th'other side, soon as they haue infreng'd His Ordinance, their God (to be aveng'd) Hath thrall'd them, now, to cruell Moabites, Anon to Edom, then to Ammonites, Then Philistins: and ay his Wrath hath bin Heauy vpon them, when they hap to sin. If so be therefore, any their Offence The iealous Iustice of their God incense; Mine not their Mounts, nor vndermine their Bowers, Nor bring thy Rams against their rampir'd Towers, Nor scale their Walls, nor lead thy Legions (With Resolution) to assault them once: For, let them heap, on Carmel Libanus; On Liban, Niphate; there-on Emmaus: Yea, in one Chanel let them muster hither Indus and Rhone, Nilus and Rhine together, Tiber and Iber too, to fence their Coast: They cannot scape from thy victorious Hoast. But, if they haue not broke the Covenant Which God to Abraham and his Seed did grant: Beware (my Lord) beware how you come neer This Holy Nation, to their God so deer. For should swart Auster him dispeople quight To furnish Thee with all His, fit to fight: Should swarming Boreas from His vtmost end All His tall Souldiers to Thy seruice send: Should Zephyrus add to Thy dreadfull Power His martiall Legions, all Hesperians Flower: Should (lastly) Eurius send Thee for Supplyes His Troops which first see Phœbus Rayes arise: All These, all-daring, all-devouring Swarms, This armed World, or all This World of Arms Could neuer conquer (in a thousand yeere) The least, worst, weakest, of these Cities heer; Because Their God will be Their sure Defence: That God almighty, whose Omnipotence Can with a breath confound all Kings that dare (As Thou doost now) 'gainst Him make open War. As th'Oceans Billowes swell not by and by, When (first) the Winds begin to bellow high; But, first begin to foam, and then to fume Higher, and higher, till their Rage presume To chide the Earth, and check the Welkins Front, And bandy Hills against the Heav'nly Mount: Euen so, the Princes of this Pagan Rout, Hearing God's prayses, forth-with break not out In ragefull Furie; but as th'Ammonite Growes in Discourse, so grow they in Despight; Till at the last, with loud, proud murmurings, They euen blaspheme the glorious King of Kings. Kill (cry they) kill; let's heaw and hale in peeces The subrile Traytor, that with wylie Speeches, To saue his Hebrews from Rhamnusias Rod, Would fright vs with a false and idle God. Renowned Generall, send but out a score Of All thy Troops, and they shall soon run-o're Those rascall Rebels; and reduce them all Prostrate and humble at Thy feet to fall: Ah Coward, Villain. But the Vice-Roy then, Stopping their lowd outrageous Storms again, Began him Selfe Thus to the Ammonite; O, impudent Impostor! Tell Mee (right) What Fiend, what Fury hath inspir'd these Spels: What Trevet told thee, or what Sibyl else Made thee belieue the Syrians shall not quell Th'Isaacian Troop, but stoope to Israel, Whose God is but their Dreame, or Fansie vain, Or meer Deuice of Moses subtile brain; Neither, of power to giue them Victorie, Nor from Our hands to rescue Them nor Thee. What God haue we, but the great King of Kings, Nabvchadnezzar? whose drad puissance rings O're all the Earth: who couering far and nigh, The Plains with Horse, Hills with Infanterie, Shall raze these Runnagates; which, fled from Nile, Haue heer vsurped Others Right yer-while, Die therefore, Villain, die; take the desert Of thy false Tongue, and of thy treacherous heart. What said I, fond? No, Dastard, I disdain My valiant Blade in Thy base bloud to stain: Thou shalt so quickly not receiue the meed Of thy disloyall and detested Deed (For, a quick Death is Wretches blisse, wee know; Them quickly ridding both of Life and Woe) But, with thy Dayes thy Dolors to protrack, Thou shalt from hence vnto Bethulia pack, Where still thou shalt, through infinite dismay, Vndying, die a thousand times a day; Vntill, with Those invincible (thou saist) With thousand wounds a wretched End thou hast. Why tremblest Thou? why doth thy colour faile? Why seems thy heart for horror so to quaile? If so Their God be God (as thou hast vanted) Now, by thy Face witnesse thy faith, vndanted. Then, the Lord Marshall, in Authoritie Vnder the Vice-Roy, not in crueltie, Transporteth speedy, neer Bethulias side Th'vn-pagan Pagan, hand and foot fast ty'd; Leauing His Troops wounded with wondrous griefe To be depriued of so braue a Chiefe: Euen so the Puttock in his croked Serrs The peeping Chicken through the Welkin bears; While the poore Dam, below cluck-clucking thick, Cryes, but in vain, and calles her rapted Chick. The Citizens, seeing the approach of Foes, Soon in alarm them all to Arm dispose; And, with meet Number of their Men of worth, And choice Commanders, brauely sally forth; Faster then Torrents, gushing from the Hills, Run hopping downe into the lower Fields. The Foe, retiring to their mightier Bands, Leaues captiue Ammon in the Hebrews hands; Whom with a forced foot, though free in thought, And Will right willing, to their Town they brought Where, round-environd with a curious Crowde, Lifting to Heav'n his hands and eyes, aloude Thus hee began: O Thou great God, the Guide Of Heau'n and Earth, and All that is beside; VVhose liuing Spirit (spred in, and over All) Giues All things Life, Breath, Growth, Originall, I giue thee, Lord, a thousand Thanks deuout, That thou hast daign'd, yer death, to take me out Of my wilde Stock, to graft me in the Stem Of th'happy Tree, deaw'd with thy Gracious stream; Which (maugre Blasts, and Blastings, rough and rife) Of All the Trees, bears onely Fruit of Life. And, good Isacians, for God's sake, I pray Miss-doubt me not, as comming to betray, Or vnder-mine by wylie Stratagem, Your Strength or State; or wrong Iervsalem. No: God doth knowe, I suffer This, for You, For witnessing before yon wicked Crew, God's mighty Arm for Your Fore-Fathers shown, As ready still, to saue and shield his Own. Feare not therefore Their mighty multitude, Whose sight (almost) so many hath subdewd, Nor let their Boasts, nor brauing Menaces, Kill, quaile, or coole, your holy Courages: For, should the whole Earth send her Sonnes, in swarms, Against you onely, all to carry Arms; So that your Trust be fixt in God alone, Not in an Arme of Flesh, not in your Own; You shall, no doubt, make ruddy, Mocmur's Flood, With Idolist Assyrian Armies blood: You shall, no doubt, of Fearfull, Fierce become, Your strong Assailants stoutly ouer-come. Th'Almighties hand, so ready bent to smight, Is, but to humble, not destroy you quight; And, but to shew you, that in all Distress, Hee, only Hee, can give you quick Redress. As from a Bramble springs the sweetest Rose; As from a Weed the whitest Lilly growes: Even so, divinest Sighes, devoutest Tears, Demurest Life, are Fruits Affliction bears. For, heer the Faithfull are much like the Earth, Which, of it Selfe (alas!) brings nothing forth But Thorns and Thistles, if the Plough she lack, With daily wounds to launce her bunchy back. But yet the Lord (who alwaies doth relent, So soon as Sinners earnestly repent, And, in his time, his sharp hand doth retire, And cast, at last, his Rods into the Fire) Will rid your dangers, and restore you rest, Even in an houre, when you can hope it least. Then, courage, Friends: let's vanquish God with Tears; And then Our Arms shall quickly conquer Theirs, Their World of Men. And, if as yet in Mee Rest any Strength; if any Courage bee; If mine Experience may in ought availe: If with mine Age, all be not old and fraile: I vow it all, and All that else is Mine, To your Defence, and for the Law divine. The end of the second Booke. The Third Booke. Flame-snorting Phlegon's ruddy breath began, Reducing Day, to gild the Indian; When early wakened with their ratling Drums, Each Heathen Souldier from his Caban comes, Takes-vp his Arms; and marching in Array, Towards Bethulia tends the ready way. In May, the Meads are not so py'd with Flowers, Of sundry Figures, Colours, Savours, Powers; As was this Hoast, with Squadrons, different In Language, Maners, Arms, and Ornament: So that th'old Chäos (wombe of th'Vniverse) Was never made of Members more diverse. Yet, heer-in All agreed, for all their Ods, To warre against th'Eternall God of Gods, Whose breath, whose beck, makes both the Poles to shake, And Caucasus and Libanus to quake. Heer, cold Hyrcania's bold and braving Seed, Mixt with (Their neighbours) both Armenias Breed, Wave wanton Crests. There, Parthian Archers try Backward to shoot, the while they forward fly. The Persian, there, proud of th'Imperiall state, With golden scales scalops his Armed plate. Heer would the Mede show, that for want of Hap, Not Heart, He lost His (late) Imperiall Cap. And that, nor Pomp of his too sumptuous Suits; His painted Cheeks, his Phrygik Layes and Lutes; His crisped Bush, not his long, borrowed Lock, Had ever power his Manly mind to smock: Happy-Arabians, who their Fern-thatcht Townes Tumble in Tumbrels vp and downe the Downes: The subtle Tyrians, who did first invent, Our winged words, in Barks of Trees to print: The men of Moab, and the Ammonites, The Iduméans, and the Elamites, Learned Ægyptians: Those that neer confine The swelting Coasts of swartest Abyssine: In briefe; All Asia was immur'd almost Within the Trenches of This mighty Hoast; Wherein, wel-neer as many Nations clustred, As th'Hebrews Army single Souldiers mustred. But, of all These, none plagu'd the Israelites, More, then their owne Apostate Ephraimites; Who, not to seem of kin to Israel, Rag'd with more fury, fought more deadly fell. As, in the Spring time, while a Poole is still, And smooth aloft, the Froggs lye croaking shrill; But if the least Stone that a Child can fling But stir the water, straight they cease to sing: So, while a happy Peace Ivdea blest, The Constancy of These stood with the best Among the Saints; and the Lord's sacred Praise Was in their mouthes daily and many waies; So that they seem'd like burning Lamps to shine Amid the Flock, devoutly-most-divine: But, at the Noyse of Holofernes Name, Their famous Faith nothing but ayre became; Their Mouth is stopr, the Zeale they did presume So highly hot, is vanisht into Fume. Nay, turned Pagans (for som Profits sake) They, worse then Pagans, their poor Brethren rake. O! what a Number of such Ephraimites Are now-adayes (Deceitfull Hypocrites!) With-in the Church, the while a prosperous winde, With gentle Gales, blowes fair and full behinde; Which seem with Zeal the Gospel to imbrace, While that it yeelds them either Gain, or Grace: But, if the Chance change; if it hap to puffe But halfe afront; if She be fain to luffe; Faint-hearted, then forth-with they cast about: And, with th'Almighty playing banque-rout, With greater Rage his Law they persecute, Then yerst with Zeal they did it prosecute; And in their Malice growe more fierce and furious, Then Iulian yerst, or Celsus, or Porphyrius. Soon as the Hebrews from their Turrets spy So many Ensignes waving in the Sky; And such an Hoast, marching in such Array, Begirt a farre their Citie every way: They faint for dread; not having where to run, Save to the GOD their Grandsires trusted on. O Father (cry they) Father of Compassion, Whose wing is wont to be our strong Salvation; Sith now against vs all the World doth swarm, O! Cover vs with thine Almighty arm. Thus having pray'd, the Carefull Gouernour To Charge his Watches doth him quick bestir; And when the Sun in his moist Cabin dives, With hundred Fires the Day again revives; Watches himselfe amid the Court of Guard; Walks oft the Round: and weens, that over-hard Phœbe's black Coachman drives his sable Steeds, Hebrews neer Ruine hasting more then needs; While, opposite, the Pagans think her fast With her Endymion, in a slumber cast: But, Mens frail wishes have (alas!) no force, To hold, or hasten, the Heav'ns settled Course. Soon as the saw Aurora's saffron ray On their Horizon to renew the Day; The Vice-Roy makes a thousand Trumpets sound, T'assemble all his scatter'd Troops around; Which from all parts with speedy pases went Environing their Chief-Commanders Tent: As round about a Huntsman, in a morn, The Hounds do throng when once they hear his horn. Having, in vain, summon'd the Town; he tries A hundred wayes, it (wrathfull) to surprise: Heer, th'Enginer begins his Ram to reare; Heer mounts his Trepan, and his Scorpion there; Bends heer his Bricol, there his boysterous Bowe; Brings heer his Fly-Bridge, there his batt'ring Crowe: Besides high Timber-Towers, on rowling Feet Mov'd and remov'd; contorlling every Street. Heer, Pioners are put the Ditch to fill; To levell Mounts, to make a Hole a Hill: To play the Moules, to dig a secret way, Into the Town their Souldiers to convay. Heer, others must their Ladders raise the while, And quick surprise the Sentinels, by wile: Others must vnder-mine: others aspire, With matter fitting, every Gate to fire. But the most part stand ready in Array To give Assault, soon as they see their Way Made meet and easie by the battering Thunder Of all their Engines pashing Wals in sunder. Tower-tearing Mars, Bellona thirsting-blood, Fill there the faintest with their Furious-mood: There fiery Steeds, stamping and neighing loud; There Pagans fell, braving and raving proud, With hideous noise make th'Heav'nly Vault resound, The Earth to eccho; and even Hell astound. But He that keeps eternall Sentinell On Heav'ns high Watch-Tower, for His Israel Pittying his People, alters, in a trice, The Tyrants purpose, by a new Advice; Causing the Captains of brave Moabites, Strong Iduméans, and stout Ammonites, Thus to advise: Most noble Generall, Terror of Kings, redoubted Scourge of All; We would not wish (my Lord) in any sort, You bring Your brave Bands to assault this Fort: For, neither Pike, Dart, Sling, Bowe, Sword, nor Shield, So back the Foe, or make them slack to yeeld; As these proud Rocks, which, by wise Natures grace, Rampire the Rampires of this wretched Place: Which yer You scale, vndoubtedly will cost Ladders of Bodies; and even Tythe your Hoast. The Victor is no Victor, if his Gain Pass not his Loss; nor th'Honor droun the Stain. Wise-valiant Prince, that Fisher, Fool we hold, Who for a Gull, venters a Line of Gold: And, ill doth th'Honor of a Crown beseem Th'inhumane, bloody, barbarous, Head of Him Who rather would the Death of many Foes, Then Life and Safety of one Friend, to chose. You may (my Lord) you may, with-out Assault, Or Loss of Man, reduce them all to nought, If in yon Hillocks you but seize the Springs, Whence hollow Lead the Hebrews Water brings; Who, so by Thirst distrest, and so put to't, Will come and cast them haltred at your Foot. The noble Lion never sets-vpon Base fearfull Beasts, but on the noblest one: Iove's sulphury Darts He seld or never thrils But on Mount Atlas, or the Ryphean Hills: And stormfull Auster, ever rather smote Clowd-cleaving Turrets then a lowly Cote: No more, no more let your drad Arms assail So faint a Foe as of himself will quail. It is not Fear (my Lord) and much-less Pittie; (Fear of our Selves, or Fauour to the Citie) Makes vs oppose vs to Thy Purpose yet: For, yer that We Thy happy Standards quit: For Thee will We defie th'immortall Gods: For Thee Wee 'll break their Altars all to Clods: For Thee will We march with vnweary soles, Beyond the Artik and Antartik Poles: For Thee will We with winged Arms go fetch Iove's Aigle down; and Neptune's Trident snatch: For Thee, the Sonne shall not his Sire forbear, Nor Sire the Sonne; nor Brother, Brother spare. The Generall, who for Avail revolves, Peizes this Counsail; and re-peiz'd, resolves: Dispatching speedy a selected Force, To seize the Waters, and divert their Course. Th'Hebrews, Their Drift, and their Owne Danger see In that Attempt: so sally instantly To stop the Foe from stopping of the Stream Which should deriue Liquor and Life to Them. Then Pagans fighting for ambitious Fame; Iewes, not to die with vn-revenged Shame; Bravely incounter with so fell Disdain, That now the Pagan flyes, now fights again; Followes his Flying Foe: and now the Iew, Nigh foiled, faints; now doth the Fight renew: So that fair Victory seems long to waver, As it were, doubtfull whether side to fauour: Till (at the last) th'Hebrews, all over spread With Clowds of Shot, back to their Bulwark fled: Even as a Pilgrim, in the naked Plain Meeting a Storm of mighty Hail or Rain, Runs dropping wet some hollow Rock to finde, Or other Covert built by Nature kinde. Pagans pursue them, and pel-mel among Enter almost the Citie in the Throng. Then every where did dreadfull Noise arise: From street to street th'amazed Vulgar flyes; Tearing their haire, beating their brest and face: As if the Foe had euen possest the Place. Why flie ye Cowards? Whither? Doe you knowe? What Fortress have you, if you This forgoe? Or, in this Citie seek you for a stronger, To gard you better, or preserve you longer? If now (alas!) you dare not beare you stout Against the Foe, while he is yet with-out; How will you dare resist his violence, Were he once Master of your weak Defence? The People, chid thus by their prudent Chief, Som-what re-heart'ned, rescue with relief Cambris and Carmis; who, the while like Towers, Had in the Gate witstood the Assaulting Stowers Of almost all the furious Infidels. For Lance, a long Mast, either strongly welds, For Arms an Anvile; each a massie Targe Of steel about his neck, as long as large: Adown their shoulders from their Helms did wave Thick Plumie Clowds of Colours-brightly brave: Both like, in Age, in Courage, Name, and Nature; Both like, in bulk, both like in Strength and Stature. Both, like two Popplars which (on either side Some silver Brook) their tressie Tops do hide Amid the Clouds; and shaken by the winde, Oft kiss each other, like Two Brethren kinde. The Heathen, seeing still fresh Troops descend From every side, the Citie to defend; Leave-off their On-set: and welnigh disbanded, Gladly retreat whither their Heads commanded. When I consider the extream distress Which thirty Dayes did the Bethulians press; Song sad enough I hardly can invent, So deadly Plight lively to represent: My hand for horror shakes, and can no more Guide on this page my Pen as heretofore: Yet doo mine Eyes with Tears bedeaw it so, It well appears a subiect full of Woe. Thou Spirit which doost all Spirits vivifie; Which didst vnloose the Tongue of Zacharie; And, through the World thy sacred Name to preach, Thy Messengers so sundry Tongues didst teach: Direct my wearie Quill, my Courage raise, That I, This Work may finish to Thy Praise. Though th'Hebrews saw their Town, on every part, Not with an Hoast, but with a World begirt, Yet had they Hope the long Siege would no less Consume th'Assyrians, then themselues distress: But when the Foe had all the Pipes depriv'd, Whence, Water yerst the sacred Town deriv'd, Alas! their Hope and even their heart did shrink, As quite cut-off, and dry'd vp with their Drink. The Rulers though (yer Bondage, Death to take) Give to the People what Themselves did lack: To wit, a hope, Water enough to keep In private Troughs, and publike Cesterns deep; Both Citizens and Souldiers to suffice, So that they would be moderate and wise. So: th'Officers divide in silver measures, To all, of all sorts, of these liquid Treasures, This welcom Liquor; which might serve (at first) To keep their life a while, not quench their Thirst. Their Cesterns dry'd, they seek in every sink: Of every Gutter greedily they drink; T'appease their Thirst awhile, not please their taste, With Drink whose stink was oft the Drinkers last. O wretched Men! O wondrous Misery! Little, or much; drink, or not drink; they dy. Plenty and Lack of Liquor, in extreme Though Contraries, concurr to murder them: With-in whose Bodies warreth Thirst, as fell As outwardly th'outrageous Infidell. Street, Lane, nor Alley had this wofull Citie, Where-in the Sisters, Enemies to Pitie, Invented not some new and vncouth guise To murder Hebrews; and from firmest eyes (In signe of Sorrow) showers to extract Of pearly Tears, of bitter brine compact; 'Mid all Degrees; if rested any-where But so much moysture as could make a Teare. There, an Old man complaineth that a Lad Hath new snatcht from him all the Drink he had: But Thirst contracts his Throat, his voyce, and vains; And ends at once his Life, his Plaint, and Pains: A Souldier heer re-swils again (and gladder) Th'vnsavory Water which had sweld his bladder: There th'wofull Mother, on her Couching-Settle, Her half-dead Childe reviveth with her Spettle: Heer the sad Lover sighes her latest breath With the last Sighes of her deer Love, in Death. For, cruell Thirst, comn from Cyrenian Strand (Where ay Shee lives amid the burning Sand, Perpetuall panting for continuall Drouth, Hanging her Tongue a foot without her Mouth, Her Face all wrinkled, both her Eyes deep sunk, Her Body leane and light, her Bowels shrunk, Her Brest transparent, and her Veins repleat With Brimstone, all, in steed of Blood's moist Heat) Blowes from her rotten Lungs a loathsome breath Through all the Town; infusing Fumes of Death In th'Hebrews Artires; causing every Porch Obscurely shine with some Funereall Torch. So that the Heav'ns, seeing so many Woes, Could hold no longer; but would faine with those Sad-weeping Hebrews Their sad Tears have meld, Save that their Tears the Lord of Hoasts with-held. And, I my Self, that drown mine Eyes with Theirs, Vnable though well to express those Tears, Will with my Silence vaile their Countenance; Following that Painters learned Ignorance, Who well conceiving that his live-less Colours Could not to life express the deadly Dolours Of Agamemnon at his Daughters End, Cover'd his sad Face with a sable Bend. Mean-while, the few that of this Wrack remain, Against their sad Chiefs murmur and complain: The Lord, say they, in Iustice recompence Your wilfull Malice, and Our Innocence: The Lord, look down vpon the wretched Teen Your wicked Counsails have heer plung'd vs in: For, had you yeelded to the Foes demand, Yer hee had entred on the Holy Land, We, happy we, had never seen our Friends So hap-lesse brought to so vntimely Ends. Alas! What Comfort rests? O wretched City! Those that besiege thee round would show thee Pity; Thine Owne are Cruell: Foes would fain preserve-thee: Thy Friends destroy thee: Those would fain reserve-thee, Would save thy Children; thine owne Children rather Run headlong all on willfull Death together. Lord, well we know, our wicked Deeds have made Thee (iust displeas'd) to drawe the keenest Blade Of thy fierce-kindled ire, which iustly sheads Thy deadliest Darts on our disloyall heads. Yet, Thou, which dost not long thy Wrath retain, (Against thine Owne) O turn to Vs again: Lord, change the purpose of our wilfull Lords, Who 'gainst our Bosomes whet the Pagan Swords: Or grant (at least) with thousand Arrowes thrill'd, We rather may by Heathen hands be kill'd; Then longer Languor of this banefull Thirst To linger vs in living Death accurst. Deer Brethren, 'tis our only Duty bindes, Their Rulers said (not our sinister mindes Of vndermining, or of pyning Ours) Thus to hold out against these Heathen Powers. If You have Pain, We have our Portion too; We are imbarkt in the same Ship with you: On the same Deep we the same Danger run; Our Cross is common, and our Loss is one: As common shall our comfort be, when GOD Shall please to ease vs of th'Assyrians Rod: As sure he will, if Your Impatiency Stop not the Course of his kinde Clemency. Then, strive not with th'All-Perfect; but depend On God alone: Whose Actions all do tend To profit His: Who, in his Season, ever (Almighty) can and will His Church deliver. Somtimes the Archer lets his Bowe, vnbent, Hang idly by; that, when it is re-bent With boysterous Armes, it may the farther cast His winged shafts, and fix them far more fast: So, oft the Lord seems, in his Bosom, long To hold his hand; and after (as more strong) To hammer Those whose impious Impudence Mis-spends the Treasure of his Patience, Which (at first sight) gives all Impunity (As think the Lewd) to all Iniquity. But, at the last, his heavy Vengeance paies Them home, for all his Iustice long Delaies: As th'Vsurer, forbearing of his poor And needy Debtors, makes his Debt the more. What though th'high Thunderer, in his Fury dread, Strike not in th'instant this proud Vice-Roy dead? Can all th'Amass of Waters which he pent Above and vnder th'ample Firmament, Seditious, so shake off his Soverain Power, As not to send the thirstie Earth a Shower? No, no: though Heav'ns, on every side so cleer, Boad nothing less then Rain, or moysture neer: They with their Tears shall shortly soak the Plain, As on the Day when Saul began to raign: For, all the Heav'ns, the Stars, and Elements, Must execute his high Commandements. But still the Plebe, with Thirst and Fury prest, Thus roaring, raving, 'gainst their Chiefs contest: O, holy Nation! shall we, shall We die, Their Elderships grave Sights to satisfie? O! shall we die to please These foolish-wise, Who make themselves rich by our Miseries; And with our Bloods would purchase them a Name, To live for ever in the Role of Fame? No, no: Let's rather break their servile bands Which hold vs in: let's take into our hands Our Cities Helm; that freeing it from Sack, We wisely so may free our Selves from Wrack. As the Physician, by the Patient Prest, Who, on his Bed (vnruly) will not rest; Permits somtimes what Art prohibiteth: Osias so, importun'd, promiseth To yeeld the Town, if in five Dayes appear No certain Signe of divine Succour neer. The People then, their woefull past estate, Their present pain, and future Fears, forgate: Sith though it should not hap as most they thirst; At least, they should of Evils scape the worst. But Ivdith (who the while incessant Showres From her sad eyes, in signe of Sorrow poures) With mournfull voyce now cals vpon the Lord; Anon, her sad Soule comforts in his Word: Prayers were her Stairs, the highest Heav'ns to clime; God's Word, a Garden, where (in needfull time) Shee found her Simples (in Examples pure) The Carefull Passion of her Heart to cure. There, Ivdith reading (then not casually, But by God's will, which still works certainly) Light on the place where the left handed Prince, Who, griev'd for Israels grievous Languishments Vnder the Heathen; to deliver them Slew Moabs's Eglon, by a Stratagem. The more she reads, she marks it, and admires That Act of Ahud, and in Zeale desires To imitate his valour. But frail flesh With thousand Reasons would her purpose dash; Proposing, now, the Facts foule odiousnes; Then, Fear of Death; then, Dangers numberless, Where-to she puts her Honor: and that (though, For Israels sake, God should the Act allow) Behoves a Man's hand, not a Woman's (there) Much fitter for a Spindle than a Speare. While Ivdith thus with Ivdith doubts doth wage, A sudden Puff turns-over that same Page: And, that which followes showes, how Iabel yerst Courageously the sleeping temples perç't Of that fell Pagan, who from th'Hebrews flying, Accursed found in his Defence his dying: To teach all Tyrants in all Times to-come, That they may fly, but not out-fly their Doome. This last Example did so fortifie The fearfull Widow, that even by and by Shee would with Engine of Revenge endevour So wicked Soule's and Bodie's knot to sever. But while apart Shee plots, and plots anew Some wylie way her purpose to pursue; She hears reported, by a neighbour Dame, The Townes Decree, much grieved at the same: So: to prevent Mischiefs so neer at hand, She sends forth-with for Those of Chiefe Command, Whom sharpely sweet She thus begins to chide: Why! How-now, Lordings, shall the Lord be ty'd Vnto your Terms? Will you th'Almightie's Arms Chain with your Counsails? limit with your Charms? O! vniudicious Iudges, will you Thus Giue law to God, who giues it Heav'n and Vs? Will you subiect, to Times confined Stayes, Th'Author of Times, Months, Moments, Years and Daies? Be not deceiv'd; The sacred Power Divine No Circumstance can compass or confine: God can do, what he will; will, what he ought: Ought loue his righteous (whom his love hath bought) This (Fathers) This my dead Hopes most reviues, That, in our Citie not a man surviues Who lifts his hands (after the Heathen fashions) Vnto the dumb, dead Idols of the Nations. All Sins are Sins: but That foule Sin, alone Exceeds all blinde or bold transgression That we have heapt 'gainst sacred Heav'n: for, that Seems to degrade God of his Soverain State; To give his Glory to a Wedge of Gold, Or Block, or Stock, or Stone of curious mold. Sith then That Sin doth not our Conscience taint, Of God's deer Succour let vs never faint: Let's think (alas!) how now all Iuda's Eyes, Agast, are cast vpon Our Constancies: Let's think, that All will (over all the Land) By our Example, either stoop or stand: Let's think, that All these Altars, Houses, Goods, Stand (after God) on our couragious-Moods: Let's think, We keep the Gate of Israel; And that, so soon opening to th'Infidell (Who hates so deadly all our Abramides) Wee shall be held Traytors and Paricides. We cannot, neither will we now deny But that our Counsaile (Thus the Chiefe reply) Was foolish, and offensive to the Lord: But now (alas!) we cannot break our word. But, if Thou rew our Common miseries; And canst not see our Tears with tear-less Eyes; Weep night and day: O! weep and sigh so much, That thy sad Sighs and Tears with ruth may touch Th'Eternall Iudge; whose gentle Eare is ay Open to All that to Him humbly pray. I shall, said Shee, and (if God say Amen) Dis-siege this City, yer we meet again. Sound me no further, but expect th'Event Of Mine (I hope) happy as high Intent: And, soon as Night hath spred her dusky Damp, Let Me go forth into the Heathen Camp. Go on, in God's Name: and where-ere thou art, God guide (say They) thy Foot, thy Hand, thy Hart. The end of the third Booke. The Fovrth Booke. Ivdith, the while, trils Rivers from her Eyes, Atterrs her knees, tends toward th'arched Skyes Her harm-less hands: then Thus, with voyce devout, Her very Soule to God she poureth out: Lord! that didst once my Grandsire Simeon arm With Iustice Sword, t'avenge his Sisters harm; Daign Me that Sword, that I may punish (iust) This Tyrant fell, far passing Sichem's Lust: Who, not suffis'd with Virgins Ravishment, And Rape of Wives; is execrably bent To root Thy Name out from the Earth around; And raze Thy Temple, levell with the ground. Presumptuous Prince! whose whole Affiance stands In Hundred-thousand Souldiers He commands, In Hundred-thousand Horse, which (thirsting-fight) With lofty Bounds the lowely Earth do smite: Without Belief, that Thou alone (O Lord) Bind'st Heads or Hands; with either Crown or Cord: Strengthenest the Feeble, quickly foylst the Strong; And lay'st the Power of proudest Kings along. Grant therefore, grant, good God, his charmed brain The curious tramels of my Tress may chain: Let every look of mine be as a Dart With amorous Breach to wound his willing heart: O! let the little grace of Face and Form Thou hast vouchsaft mee, calm his furious storm: Let the smooth cunning of my soothing Lips Surprise the fell Fox in his Suttleships: But, chiefly, Lord, let my victorious hand Be Scourge and Hammer of this Heathen Band: That all this All may knowe, that Abram's Race Is ever covered with thy Shield of Grace; And that no Tyrant ever toucht thy Iury, But felt in fine the Rigor of thy Fury. Let not, good Lord, O let not one of These Return to taste Hytane or Euphrates. Thus Ivdith prayes: and in the steed of stops, With thousand Sighes her words She interrupts. Then, from her sad sole Chamber, late she packs, Adorn'd with Ophir-Gold, and Serean knacks. O! silver-browd Diana, Queen of Night, Dar'st thou appear, while heer below, so bright Shines such a sacred Star, whose radiant flame Would even at Noon thy Brothers splendor shame? Though, as vnknown, to passe vnshown she ween, Her Odors made her smelt, her Iewels seen; Musk, Ambergris, and Civet, where she went, Left all along on odoriferous Sent: A Carbuncle shin'd on her Brow so bright, That with the Rayes it clarified the Night: A silver Tincel waving in the winde, Down from her head hung light and loose behinde: Gold bound her golden Tress; her Ivory Neck Rubies and Saphirs, counter-chang'd in check: At either Eare, a richer Pearle then yerst Ægypts proud Princesse in her Cup disperst: Her soft white Bosome (as with Curtains drawn) Transparent coverd vnder Cob-web Lawne: Her Robe, Sky-colour'd Silk, with curious Caul Of golden Twist, benetted over all. The rest she wore, might haue beseem'd for Tires The stately Foundress of th'Euphratean Spires. For, though her Selfe were Modesty it selfe; T'intice this Pagan to the wrackfull Shelfe, Besides her Owne, sh' had borrowed Ornaments Of other Ladies of most Eminence. Achior, watching in the Court of Guard, Seeing her pass so late, and so prepar'd; Enquires of Carmis (who then watched too) What, Whence, She was, and what she went to doo: So brave a Gallant, trickt and trimmed so; In such a Time, in such a Place of Wo. Yer-while, said Carmis, in our Citie dwell'd Merari; a man heer high in Honor held: To whom, for Seed, God but this Daughter sent: His House's Ioy, This Citie's Ornament. Gain-greedy Fathers, now-adayes turmoyle Bodies and Soules, Heap vpon Heap to pile: But, have no care with the Mind's Goods to grace Th'heires of their Goods (which after melt apace): Much like a Man that keepeth in his Chest His costly Garment, folded fair and prest, But lets his Body, it was made to serue, Naked the while, in Wet and Cold to starue. But, as the Farmer spares no pains, nor cost, In husbanding his Land; but carefull most, Now rids the stones, anon rips-vp the Ridges, Heer casts a Ditch; there plants, there plashes hedges; And never is his hand or toole there-fro: But chiefly careth there good Seed to sowe, That when the Summer shall haue ryp't his Plains, His Crop may pay him for his Cost and Pains: Or, as som Damsell, having speciall Care Of som fair Flower, which puts-out early-rare Th'Incarnat Bud; weeds, waters every-houre The fertill Plot that feeds her Gilli-flower; That, one-day blown, it may som Sunday-morn Her lilly Bosom, or her head adorn: So wise Merari did endevour fair To form the Maners of his tender Heir; That, in his Age, he thence again might gather Th'Honor and Comfort worthy such a Father. For soon as ever, stutting yet and weak, Her tender Tongue did but begin to speak; He taught her not (as many Fathers doo: Too-many now) vein words, and wanton too, But som good Prayer, or God's Ten-fold Law; That, with her Milk, she might even suck the Aw Of the Almighty: which not vain appears; For that the Damsell brought forth, in few yeers, Fruits worthy of such Seed: whence did ensew, That this her Nurture to a Nature grew. So doth a Vessell long retain the Sent Of the first Liquor we have settled in 't: So doth a Bough bend ever (when 'tis big) To the same side that it was bent, a Twig: So, Bears, Wolves, Lions; and our wildest Game, Bred tame with vs, with vs continue tame. When as twelue times She twelue new Moons had past, This vertuous Pattern all Perfection grac't. For, th'expert Pilot is not more precise To shun, in Sayling, all the Ieopardies Of Cyane Streight, of hatefull Syrtes Sand, Charibdis Gulf, and of Capharean Strand, Then was wise Ivdith to avoyd the Dames Never so little spotted in their Names: Knowing that long conversing with the light, Corrupts the sobrest; or at least, though right, Right safe th'Honor be sav'd; the Names not so, From common Bruit (though often false) we know. For, haunting Good, good are we holden ay: Bad, with the Bad: Like will to like, we say. Shee, ever modest, never vs'd to stay Abroad till midnight at a Mask or Play: Nor trip from Feast to Feast, nor Street-webs span, To see, and to be seen of every man. But rather, knowing that such fond desire To gaze and to be gaz'd-on (Flax and Fire) Vndid light Dina, and such gadding Dames A thousand more; their Noble Houses Shames; She wisely kept at home, where, Morn and Even, Daily she call'd vpon the God of Heav'n. The rest of every day in dutious course She serv'd her Nursers for a tender Nurse: As wont the Storks kinde and officious Brood For their old Parents to go gather Food; And on som high Firre (far-off having flow'n) Bring life to Those from whom they had their owne. If in the Day, from Houswifes needfull care, She had perhaps an houre or two to spare, She spent them reading of the Sacred Book, Where faithfull Soules for spirituall Manna look. Somtimes on Cloth sh' embroydered cunningly Som Beast, or Bird, or Fish, or Worm, or Fly. Somtime she wrought with silver needle fine On Canvas-web som History divine. Heer Lot, escap't from that drad Flame, from High Which burnt his Town with winged Feet doth fly To little Zoar: while his Wife (alack!) Incredulous, and curious, looking back; God in the instant smiting for that Fault, Transforms her Bodie to a Bulk of Salt. Heer, chaste Susanna (slandred of dishonor) Seems led to Death, People seem prest to stone her: But, Truth appearing, soon they seem at-once To turn on th'Elders all their storm of stones. Heer loyall Ioseph rather leaues behinde His cloak then heart with his too-Lady-kinde: And rather chooseth (by her false disgrace) His Irons, then her Arms, him to imbrace. Heer, rash, rough Iephthe in vnsacred slaughter Imbrews his owne Blade in his only Daughter; By private and improvident Annoy, Troubling the Publique and the generall Ioy. Wearie of Work, on her sweet Lute she playes, And sings withall som holy Psalm of Praise; Not following such as by lascivious Dances, Lavish Expences, light and wanton Glances, Seek to be sought, courted, and lov'd of most: But, as the Fisherman, that baits the Coast With poysony Pastes, may haue a greater draught, And (though less wholesom) hath more Fishes caught Then those that only vse their Hook, or Net: So may these Gallants them more Lovers get, Then modest Maids; But, their immodest flame Fires none but Fools, Frantikes, or Voyds of shame. Vertue alone begins, begets, conceiues, A perfect Love; which, though it slowe receiues His Form and Life, nor is so soon afire: So, neither doth it halfe so soon expire. Straw kindles quickly, and is quickly past: Iron heats but slowely, and it's heat doth last. Now Ivdith's fair Renown through Iuda rings In every City; and great Suters brings (From All-form Fashions, from fair painted Faces, From Powdred Tresses, from forc't Apish Graces, From Prince-fit Pompe; from Peacocks strutting by With Bosoms naked to the Navel nigh) To woo Her Vertue. But, Loves burning Dart Could neither harm, nor warm her Icie heart. For, as hard Hammers, harder Diamant; She harder did resist Loves grace to grant; Having resolved, sole and single, rather To spend her dayes with her deer-loved Father. But at the last, importun'd long, and prest By her deer Parents, carefull of her Rest; She took Manasses, one of Noble blood; Rich, in the Mind's, Nature's, and Fortune's Good. Their Mariage then was neither stoln, nor packt, Nor posted; to prevent som Pre-contract, To cheat som Heire, some Avarice to choak, To cover Others, or their owne Sin cloak: But duly past, modest, and reverent, With Either's Parents knowledge and consent. Dina's Disasters to this day do prove The sad successes of prepost'rous Love; Of priuy Choyce, close Matches, and vnkend; Which seldom bring Lovers to happy end: And that our Selves ought not our Selves bestow, But Those from whom our Birth and Breeding grow. This happy Match begun thus holily, And holy carried, did so firmly tie This chaste young Couple, in so mutuall loue, That both their bodies seems one soule to moue. Th'one never wisht but what the other would: Both by one Organ their one-minde vnfould: And, as a Hurt on the Right side (we see) Reacheth the Left; even so, by sympathie, Her Husbands Sorrows did sad Ivdith share, And Ivdith's Sorrows her sad Husband bare. The Husband did not his deer Wife controule, As Tyrants rule: but, as the tender Soule Commands the Bodie; not the same to grieue, But comfort rather, cherish and relieue. Him Ivdith lov'd as Brother (or more, rather) Fear'd as her Lord, and honour'd as her Father. Their House, for Order so religious, Seem'd more a Temple than a private House: There, did no Mayd, with merry-tricks, intice The bashfull Stripling to lascivious vice: There, did no drunken Groom sick Healths disgorge, Nor against Heav'n blasphemous Oathes re-forge: There, no broad Ieaster, no bold common Lyer, No Gamester, Theef, Rogue, Ruffin, Apple-squire, Had ever harbor: but all Servants, there, To their graue Rulers Rules conformed were. Manasses, knowing what a Flood of Crimes Surrounded all, in His enormous Times; Especially, what Evils Confluence Had even corrupted sacred Gouernments (So that, for favour, or for Mony (more) Fools, Knaves, Boyes, Basest, highest Burthens bore) He modestly refus'd all Publike Charge: Holding him happy so, free and at large, Farre from the Courts of State and Iustice too, Quiet at Home, his Houshold dues to doo. Yet notwithstanding, knowing too that none Was ever born so for himselfe alone, But that the best part of our dayes (though few) T'our Countrey, Kinred, and our Friends is due; No Magistrate, Hee daily serv'd the State More then a hundred that in Office sate. For, in His House did sacred Iustice live, And from his Lips would Shee her Sentence give. He ever was th'afflicted Poors Protector, Widows Supporter, Silly-ones Director, Orphans kinde Father: Every Age, Sex, Sort, Had from his hand some kinde of kinde Support. Never vain Thirst of the 'curs't Earth of Inde, Made Him wound Water, neither woo the Winde: Never did Avarice his Life endanger, With mercenarie Sword to serve the Stranger: Never did He, to Adverse-Clyents, fell A double Breath, blowing to Heav'n and Hell; But, strife-less, vsing harmless Husbandry, Took of his Land both Stock and Vsury Of his lent labours. For, somtimes, by Line, He plants an Orchard; which he orders fine, With equi-distant Trees, in Rowes direct, Of Plums, of Pears, and Apples most select: Heer-there, He Crab-stocks sets, then grafts thereon Som stranger Slip: inocculates anon: Anon with keen Share the kinde Earth he shreds: Anon the Vine vnto the Elm he weds: Anon he prunes-off the superfluous shoots: Anon the Bodies pares, then bares the roots. For, neither Dog-Dayes, nor December's Ice, Could keep Him Prisoner in his Chamber, nice. But, as one-day, his Reapers he beheld, Who, swelting, swift the yellow handfuls feld; Sol, from his head, caus'd a Catarrh descend, Which shortly after caus'd Manasses End. He that can number, in November, all The withered Leaves that in the Forrests fall: He hat can number all the Drops, in Showers, Which Hyades, Pleiades, and moist Orion poures Vpon the Plains: may tell the Tears She shed, For her deer Husband so vntimely dead. The Wealth and Treasure he had left her, kinde, In steed of easing, more afflicts her Minde: Th'vse of his Goods still sets before her eyes Their good old Owners sweet and gracefull guise. Had Shee had all the Gold was gather'd ever On all the shoal Sands of the Lydian River, Sh' had not been Rich, being bereft of Him, Without whom, Wealth doubled her Woes extream: And, with whom, glad she would have born the crosses Of wretched Iob's, sad, sudden, many Losses. Phœbus had thrice through all the Zodiak past, Since His Decease: Yet Time, which all doth waste And cures all Cares, could not her Griefs recover, For Loss of Him, her deerest Lord and Lover. Still therefore, cover'd with a sable Shrowd Hath She kept home; as all to Sorrow vow'd: For, for the most part, solitarie sad, Tears in her eyes, sack on her back she had, Grief in her heart: so, on the wither'd Spray The Widow-Turtle sighes her mournfull Lay; Sole, and exil'd from all Delights, that move; Chastly resolv'd t'accept no Second Love. If any time Ivdith went out of Doore (As Dutie bindes) is was to see some Poore: Som woefull Woman in deep Passions toyld For sudden Loss of her deer only Childe: Some long-Sick bodie, or some needy soule, With needfull Comforts of her Bag, or Boule: Or else to go (as GOD commanded Them) To Pray and Offer at IERVSALEM. Thus, deer Companion, have I briefly show'n Fair Ivdith's Story: on whose Worth alone All eyes are cast, but cannot tell you out Whither she goes; less, what she goes about. But, if we may, from former things infer A ghesse of future; We may hope from Her Some Happiness: and sure, me thinks, her Cheer, So pleasant chang'd, boads some good fortune neer. With this Discourse, the wakefull Hebrew Knight, Walking between, wore-out the weary Night. Ivdith the while, her Handmaid with her, hies Towards the Trenches of the Enemies. Yer from the Fort Shee had a furlong gon, The Heathen Scouts descry'd her, and anon Bespake her Thus: O! more than humane Beauty, Whence? What are You? What cause hath hither brought ye Into th'Assyrian Camp? Alas! I am (Sighing, quoth Shee) a wofull Hebrew Dame, Who, to escape so many Deaths, or Thrall, Come heer to yeeld me to your Generall. Then to the Duke they lead her. Who-so-e're Hath seeen, in Cities, how they flock, to hear Som prating Montibank; or see som Monster New brought from Africk, or from Inde; may conster What press of Souldiers from all parts did throng, About his Tent; and even prest in among To see that compleat Shee, so comly deem'd; Who, the more look't on, the more louely seem'd. Her waved Locks, som dangling loose, som part In thousand rings curld-vp, with art-less art; With gracefull Shadowes sweetly did set-out Her broad high Fore-head, smooth as Ice, about: Two slender Bowes of Ebene, equall bent Over two Stars (bright as the Firmament) Two twinkling Sparks, Two sprightfull Ietty Eyes (Where subtle Cupid in close Ambush lyes, To shoot the choysest of his golden Darts Into the chariest of the chastest hearts): 'Twixt these Two Suns, down from this liberall Front, Descendingly ascends a prety Mount; Which, by Degrees, doth neer those Lips extend, Where Momus Lips could nothing discommend: Her ruddy, round Cheeks seem'd to be composed Of Roses Lillied, or of Lillies-Rosed: Her musky Mouth (for shape and size so meet, Excelling Saba's pretious Breath, for sweet) A swelling Welt of Corall round behemms, Which smiling showes two Rowes of orient Gemms: Her Ivory Neck, and Alabaster Brest Ravish the Pagans more then all the rest: Her soft, sleek, slender hands, in Snowe bedipt, With purest Pearl-shell had each Finger tipt. In brief, so passing Her Perfections were, That, if rare Zeuxis had but found Her there, Or such another; when from curious Cull Of Croton Dames so choisely Beautifull, By many Beauties (severally met) His cunning Pencill drew the Counterfait Of Her for Whom Europe and Asia fought; This only Piece had he sufficient thought. Ivdith no sooner came within the Tent, But both her Cheeks a bashfull Blush besprent, Trembling for Fear: vntill, inviting neerer, The courteous General's gentle words re-cheer-her. Sweet hart I am not, I am not so fell As false Report hath told fond Israel: Who Me for Father, I for Children take; I love whom love my Lord their God to make: And who doe both, may be assur'd to have What ever Good, Mans heart can hope, or crave: Which Israel well should finde, would they give eare To that Kings Favour, whose drad Power they feare: Then fear not Thou, my Love; but tell me free The happy Cause that hither bringeth thee. O Prince! said Shee (with, then, firm Countenance) Supreme, for Fortune, Wisedom, Valiance, Of all that ever had Command in Field, Or ever manag'd martiall Sword and Shield: Although my frail Sex, and weak bodie's state, No longer could endure the wretched fate; Wants, Labours, Dangers, and the deep Affright My fellow Towns-folk suffer day and night: Yet is not That the Cause that drives me thence, Nor That which drawes me to Your Excellence: But, 'tis a never-never-dying Worm Which gnawes my Conscience; a continuall Storm, A holy Fear, least I be forç't to eat (Among my People) som vnlawfull meat. For, I foresee (Sir) that our Folk, yer long, With cruell Famine so extreamly wrung, Will be constrain'd to fill, and 'file them too With vnclean Flesh, which God forbids vs doo: And that the Lord (who strikes, with iust Revenge Whom-ever dare his drad iust Lawes infrenge) Will then, without Fight, give Thee vp their Place; And one of Thine Thousands of Them shall chase. Therefore (my Lord) God's Wrath and yours to fly, Out of Bethvlia, to your Camp come I; Beseeching humbly, for your Honors sake, That heer no Rigour, neither Wrong I take. Hee's more than Wit-less that him wilfull throwes (Winking) in Dangers that he well fore-knowes; And when he may live, pain-less, and secure; In Toil-full Fears will his owne Death procure. Now: please thee grant me, in this Vale (away From noyse and number) nightly to go pray; Hebrews no sooner shall God's Wrath incense, But I, inspir'd, shall shew thine Excellence: And then shall I thy valiant Legions lead Over all Iuda; and thy Standards spread Shall swell in Sion, where not one shall dare Lift Lance against thee, nor Defence prepare: No, not a Dog so much as bark at Thine Arms-clashing Army nor their Armors Shine. Thy Name alone shall tame the stoutest Troup: To Thee the Hils their proudest Tops shall stoup: Rivers, for Thee, their rapid Course shall stay, To yeeld Thine Hoste a new vn-wonted way. The Prince replies: O, Worlds sole Ornament! Lady, as fair as wise and eloquent; Right-Welcom are You: and we wish you ever In all Contentment with vs to persever. And, if you prove in Truth and Loyalty, As you are pleasing to mine Eare and Eye; I shall from henceforth worship evermore The mighty God you Hebrews do adore: You shall from henceforth only Lady be Both of my Sceptre, of my Soule, and Me: Henceforth your Name with high Renown shall ring Where Heber, Ister, Nile, and Ganges spring. With Licence then, soon as the Moon with light Of silver Rayes began to cleer the night, The Widow hies to a dark Vale apart; Where first she bathes her hands, and then her heart: Then, from her Eyes a luke-warme Rill she showres: Then, from her Soule this fervent Prayer powres: Lord God, no longer now Thine Aide deny To those that only on Thine Aide rely. Lord rescue Those that ready are to spend Their bloods and goods, Thine Honor to Defend. Lord, let our Infants sad and cease-less Mones, Our wofull Elders deep and dismall Grones, Our Matron's Scrieches, Cries of Virgins fair, Our sacred Levit's Day-and-nightly Prayer, Pearce to Thy Throne, to wake thy slumbring Ey. Drad God of Iustice, glorious Father; Why Do sulphury Bolts of thy best Thunder light On Carmel's Top, and little Hermon smite: And let th'Heav'n-threatning Sons of Earth alone; On proudest Ossa, prouder Pelion? Alas! What said I? Ah! forgive me, Lord, This idle, rash, and vnadvised Word; Which, in frail Passion, my fond Lips did borrow From fervent Zeale of mine vnfained Sorrow. No: O, Our Lignes sole Pillar dearly dread, I knowe, Thou shortly wilt their Head behead. I knowe, This hand, by Thy right hand led out, Shall at one Blowe, This Heathen Army rout, The end of the fourth Booke. The Fift Booke. For blood and marrow, in his veins and bones, The Vice-Roy feeds new Pains, new Passions; Which, while he shuns, hee seeks; feels, yet not knowes, A dead-live Fire, which of Selfe's Cinders growes. For, th'Hebrew Lady's rapting Rarities Being now sole Obiect of his Soule's dim Eyes; Sad, peevish pale, soft, drowsie, dream-awake, Care of his Hoast he doth no longer take: Goes no more out, a-nights, to set his Watches, And Courts of Guard about, on all Approches: Comes not to Counsail, neither gives The Word: Nor viewes the Quarters of his Camp: nor stir'd. As Sheep, that miss their wonted Gard and Guide, Dispersed stray; now, by some Rivers side, Or gurgling Brook; now, vp and down the Downes; Now, in the Groves; now, on the Fallow grounds: So th'Ethnik Army, without Rule or Reine, Pursue their Pleasures, violent, or vaine: None will obey; None but will now Command; Each, as him listeth, dares him now dis-band. Hebrews, Why stay you now mew'd in your Citie? Now, now or never, doth the Time befit-ye To sally on the Foe; whose rank Disorder Among themselves, themselves (in Fight) will murder. Nay; bouge not though: of such a Victory God will the Honor have, and Author be. Yer that blinde Cupid did this Tyrant blinde, To take the Town was Day and Night his minde; Now, day and night he mindes but how to gain A Lady's grace; Who, taken, is not taen (Her Soule being temper'd more then Fancy-proofe): Yer-while, th'vndanted mighty Theban rough Could not have fear'd Him, with his massie Mace; Now, but a Glance of a weak Woman's Grace Dismaies him, daunts him, nay even wounds him deep, Past care of Cure; and doth him Captive keep: Yer-while Ambition, with Drums rattling Din, Awakt him early, yer the Day peept-in; Now Love awakes him; and with His Alarms Makes him neglect the Hebrews and their Arms: Yer-while, he had Princes and Kings at bay; Now, of Him Selfe hath neither Power nor Sway. Alas! alas! Vnhappy Change, said Hee: Must I live Captive to my Captive-Shee? Is This (alas!) to live: the Body base't; The minde as brute; and both their Powers defac't! This is not Life: or is worse Life to feel, Then sad Ixion's, on the brazen Wheel Eternall turning: or a life (in brief) Most like the Life of that celestiall Thief, Whose ever-never-dying heart and liver On Scythian Rocks feed a fel Vulture ever. What boots me, t'have subdew'd so many Lands? What, to have tam'd with my victorious hands All Nations lodg'd betwixt Hydaspes large, And th'Haven where Cydnus doth in Sea discharge? Sith I am vanquisht, by the feeble Might Of Captive Ivdith's Glance. What boots my bright Strong steeled Targe? my brazen Burguinet? My martiall Gard about my Body set? Sith the keen Shot which her quick eye doth dart, Through Steel, and Brass, and Gard, doth wound my hart. VVhat boots my Courser swifter then the VVinde, Leaving the Swallowes in his speed behind? Sith, on his back flying, I cannot flie The willing Chaines of my Captivitie. Change, change then, Hebrews, into Smiles your tears; Triumph of Me, mine Hoste, Arms, Swords and Spears: I am no more the Duke, whose Name alone Yerwhile with Terror shook you every-one: No: I am He whose Courage, late so brave, Is now become but Slave vnto my Slave: I am not come, to Warr with Israel, To burne your Cities, or your Selues to quell: But to intreat You, to intreat (for Me) Your match-less Ivdith, that She milder be. But whither, Wit-less, whither am I born By Loves fond Fury; wilfully forlorne? Have I not Her heer in my Patronage, That can the Anguish of my Soule asswage? And yet with idle Plaints I pearce the Skyes; And thus vn-Manly melt me at mine Eyes. Vnhappy Me! my wretched Case is such As His, who wants most what he hath too-much; A Crystall River flowing to his Lip; Yet dies for Thirst, and cannot drink a sip: For, so do I respect her Excellence, Her Heav'n-given Graces; that, for Reverence, Mine eyes dare scarce behold her, and my Tongue, In steed of suing, to my roof is clung. O that my Brest transparent Crystall were, That She might see my hearts dire Torment there; And there read plainely, what my Loves excess (Alas!) permits not my sad voice t'express. Since Ivdith first came to th'Assyrian Camp, Thrice had the Heav'ns light and put-out their Lamp; And now Aurora, with a saffron Ray, Began, in Inde, to kindle the fourth Day: When as the Duke, who Food and Rest forsakes, This heauy Moan, to 's Eunuke Bagos, makes: Bagos, my Sonne adopted, not by Chance; Bagos, whom I, still studying to advance, Have made, of Meanest and neglected most, First in my heart, and Second in mine Hoste, Bagos, I burn, I raue, I rage, I die Of wounds receiu'd from that faire Strangers Eie. Go, seek her out: go quickly: tell her Thou My loving Languor: tell her, that I vow To make her equal, nay above the best Of greatest Dames whom royall Crowns invest: Especially, insinuate so, that She Be pleas'd this night to come and sup with Me. Wer 't not a Folly, nay a Madnes meer, In Me, to have the rarest Beauty heer This Age hath bred; and yet, too-faint a Foole, I should not dare my hearts hot Thirst to coole? Would not my Soldiers laugh at it apace? Nay: would not Ivdith blush at My Disgrace? Bagos, too-apt, too-vs'd to such a Turn; Thus oyles the Fire, which but too-fast did burn: My Lord, if Priavte men (whose otious Care Scarce passe the Threshold of their owne Door dare; Whose Mindes, content with their vnhappy Hap, For other Grace or Greatnes never gape) Liue not content (alas!) vnless some-while Venus warme Comforts their chill Cares beguile: How-more vnhappy then, are Those that beare An Atlas Burthen: Those that Rest forbeare, For Others Rest: Those that (like Argus) wake While Others, fear-less, their full Naps doo take: If, among all their Gall, their Toil, their Teen, Some (Cupids) Hony be not mixt between? Then, Sir, pursue your Love: lose not the Game, Which of it self comes to your Net, so tame. And, if in like Imployments, heertofore Y' haue found Me fit and faithfull evermore; In This new Trust, you shall by speedy Trial, Finde me more secret, diligent, and loyall. Alas! How-many BAGOS's, in our Time In Princes Courts, to highest Honors climbe, More, for their Cunning in such Embassies, Then for Repute of learned, stout, or wise: Whilom, great Courts were Vertue's Academs; Now, Schools of Vice: now (rather) Sinks of Realms. You, who, Great-minded, cannot be content To be close-Brokers for th'Incontinent: Who cannot brew (with too-too-dangerous Skill) Both a Love-Potion, and a Cup to kill: VVho cannot, noble, your free Natures strain, With flattering pencil on your Face to fain A Face of frownes, or Smiles; of Wrath, or Ruth; To please the Great (rather with Tales then Truth): Come not at Court; if I may counsail you. For, There, in steed of Grace and Honor, dew Vnto your Vertues; you shall nothing gain, But that which There still haunts the Good; Disdain. You, Noble Ladies, in whose heart is graven A filial Feare of th'All-see GOD of Heaven: You that more prize your Honor's pure Report, Then Love of Princes: keep yee from the Court. But You, who, hauing neither Land nor Money, Out-brave the bravest: Who with words of Hony, And Friend-like Face, Dissemblers, humbly greet VVhom your false harts wish in their winding sheet: Who, lavish, sel your Wives for Offices: Who make you Noble, by base Services: Who, seruing Time, can set your Faith to sale; Shift your Religion; saile with euery Gale: Who, Parasites, can put more Faces on Then euer Proteus in the Seas hath show'n: Who, forcing Nature, can your Manners fit To my Lords Humor; and so humor it; Like a Chameleon, which, heer blew, there black, Heer gray, there green, doth with his Obiect take: Who can invent new Toules, new Taxes finde, To charge the People, and the Poore to grinde: Who, fayning to possesse your Princes Eare, Make Sutors crouch, and court you euery-where; And, subtle Shifters, sell them deere your Smoak, Blinding the Wretches with a wilie cloake. You, warbling Sirens, whose delicious Charms Draw wariest youth into your wrackfull Armes: You Circes, you whose powerfull Spells transmute Your Loues to Stones, Hogs, Dogs, and euery Brute: You Stymphalides, whose Auarice deuoures The richest Treasure of Youth's freshest Flowers: You, you, whose Painting, and Pearl-golden-glister, Of Priam's old Wife, make yong Castor's Sister: You Myrrha's you Canaces, Semi-ram's: And, if there be any more odious Dames: Come You to Court: come quickly: There, on You A hundred Honors shal be heapt, vn-dew; You, there shall sell Iustice, Preferments, Places: Yea, you shall sell mis-gouernd Princes Graces. But, Muse, it boots not: Hadst Thou thousand-fold The Strength and Stomack of Alcides bold, Thou couldst not clense These Sin-proud shining Halls, Fouler by far then foule Augeas Stalls. Let's back to Ivdith; who to bring about Her hard deseign, survayes her, sets her out, Be-curles her Tresses; makes her Crystall cleer Her Beauties Iudge, which had in Earth no peer. Then comes she to the Tent, rich hanged round With curious Arras, from the top to ground; Where Art-full fingers, for a Web of glory, Had wov'n Medes, Persians, Syrian Princes Story. There Ninus first, pusht by vain Prides amisse, Vsurps the East: heer comes Simiramis, VVho, fayning Her a Man, th'Assyrians swayes And to the Clowds her Babylon doth raise. See, see a Prince, with soft white fingers fine, Effeminate, sits spinning Flaxen Twine: And, for a Launce, bearing a Distaffe, showes That more to Female then to Male he owes: See, how he poats, paints, frizzles, fashions him; Bathes, basks, anoints, viewes, and re-views his Trim Within his Glass, which for a Glaiue he weares. See, how he shifts to hide his Shame and Fears: From Vardingale to Vardingale, he flyes His braue Lieutenant, least Hee him suprize. Yer, see, at last (to act one Manly thing) Hee burns himselfe, not to out-live a King. See, heer an Infant sucking of a Bitch Vnder a Hedge, and in a shallow Ditch; Who grown a Man, heer musters in his Train Both bond and free, the Souldier and the Swain; Subdues the East, and into Persia drawes The Medes proud Sceptre; &amp; he giues them Lawes. But who's That marches so dis-figured there, Before an Army, without Nose, and Eare? 'Tis that good Servant, who reduç't, alone, Vnder Darius, Rebell Babylon. While, with these Showes sad Ivdith entertaind Her Eyes, but not her hart (too-inly-paind) In comes the Duke: and with right courteous cheere Kindely salutes her, hands her hand; and neere Causing her sit in a rich easie Chaire, Himselfe, at ease, viewes and re-viewes her Faire. Then, seeing him so nigh his wished Pleasure, His hart's a-fire: not hath he longer leasure To stay for Venus, till, Star-crowned bright, On their Horizon Shee bring back the Night. The VVidow, knowing Time and Place, as yet, For God's Decree, and her Deseign, vnfit; Findes still Delayes: and, to delude his Loue, Shee (wylie) still Speech vpon Speech doth moue. My Lord, pray tell me, What so great Offence So grievously your Fury could incense; What? When? Where? Why? How? and by Whom our Folk Could so the Wrath of such a Prince provoke, So separate, in Language, Land, and Law; Who neuer Vs; and Whom we neuer saw? Vnciuil were He (Sweet) replyes the Prince, Could ought deny to such an Excellence. Then: as the Heav'ns cannot Two Suns sustaine: No more can Earth Two Kings at once contain, Of equall Power and State: for, Souerantie Brooks no Co-partner, no Equality. Witnes my Souerain: who, offended at The Power and Pomp of mighty Arphaxat, Who, high aspire, and farre to spred began, And to the Clowds had built his Echatane, Ninive's Shame, and dread of Babylon: Brauely end euours of supplant His Throne, Bereaue his Sceptre, sack, raze, ruinate, His goodly Cities, and himselfe dis-State. But Arphaxat, as valorous as sage (And both, right worthy of his Crown and Age) Would rather venture Media's Royall Rings, Then vaile to Anie. So between Two Kings, Two stout, and stirring Spirits (whereof the-one Could brook no Peer, th'other, Superior none) Began a dreadfull and right deadly War, Lasting (alas!) too-long, spreading too-far. Arphaxat arms Those, where the Flower of Greece Fetcht, not the Locks of an old Golden Fleece, But massie Ingots, which doe richly pave The happy Plains great Phasis Streams belave: The Harmastans, th'Albanians, wont to mowe Three times a yeer, where onely once they sowe: Whom Oxus boundeth with his swelling Tide: Whom Anti-Taurus double Horns diuide: Those on the Mountain, whose high-lowely back Bow'd to the Vessell which preseru'd from wrack The Worlds Abbridgement: Those along the Shores Where proud Iaxartes rapid Current rores: In short, besides his Medes he had in Pay, All, neere the Pontike and the Caspian Sea. So that, already, This great King-Commander, Had Hopes as high as euer Alexander. My Prince, resolv'd to conquer, or to die, Omits no point of Opportunitie For his Affaires: Hee armeth Sittacen, Levies the Archers of all Osrolen: Those, whose rich Plain hundred for one repay, From Euphrates and Tigris much away: Fish-fed Carmanians (who with Seal-skin Iacks, In sted of Iron, arme their warlike Backs) Gold sanded Hytan's natiue Shores forgo: You, Parthians, Cossians and Arabians too, By your sage Magis deep prophetike Charmes Sacredly counsail'd, take you all to Armes: And Thou, Chaldea, turn'st to Swords, and Spears And Shields, Thy Rules, Squires, Compasses and Sphears. For, of his Subiects spares he not a man That beare a Launce or Pike, or Crosbow can: Wiues, Beldams Babes, Gray-heads (&amp; Sickly, some) Through all his Countries onely kept at home. He also sends for Persians and Phœnicians; For soft Egyptians, Hebrews, and Cilicians, Quickly to come, and kindly take his Part: But Neuters, They (more Friends in face, then hart) Reiect his earnest Sute, Himselfe neglect; And vse his Legats but with small respect. My Lord dissembles for a while This wrong, Till hauing tryumpht of a Foe more strong, Hee may with more ease, and with danger lesse, Their Sacrilege and surly Pride represse. In Ragau's ample Plain, one Morning, met These Royall Armies, of two Kings, as great As ever Mars with steele and Furie arm'd, Fury and Pride so Eithers Souldier warm'd, That hardly could they stay till Trumpets shrill Denounce the Battaile, and giue leaue to kill: But with stern Looks, and brauing Threats, afar; At hand, with Blowes; they had begun to war; Exchanging wounds. Two thousand Perduz first Giue brauely th'Onset: and not much disperst, From suddain whirle-wind of their nimble Slings, So thick a storm of humming Pebbles sings So-sad a Dirge of Deaths, that they suppose, That not one Troop, but All, had bin at Blowes. To second Those, then, in good ordinance, With waving Ensignes, thousand Troops aduance: Both Armies ioyne. Now fiercely fall they to 't, Mede vpon Chalde, pressing foot to foot; Incount'ring felly with a furious noise Of clashing Arms, and Angry-braving Voice, Lowder then Nile, rushing from Rocky-Coomb; Or then Encélade, when he shakes his Toomb. Heer lyes one head-lesse: foot-lesse there (alas!) Another craules among the gorie Grasse: One's shoulder hangs: another hangs his Bowels About his neck (but new bound vp in towells): This, in the Face, That in the Flank is hurt: This, as he dyes, a Floud of Blood doth spurt: That, neither liues nor dyes; but sees at once Both vpper Iove's and neather's diverse Thrones; Because, some little spirit (too-stubborn-stout) Still, in the Body, will not yet come out. Yer-while the ground was yellow, green, &amp; blew; Now onely couerd with a Crimsin hew: While one doth (heer) another deadly thrill, Another Him, Another Him doth kill: Still Rage increases: still doth Fury spread, Till all the Field be but a Heap of Dead. One-while the Syrians by the Medes are chas't; Anon the Medes by Syrians are re-chas't: As one-while, from the Sea vnto the Shore, Surge after Surge, VVaue after Waue doth rore. Another-while, from Shore to Sea they ply VVaue after Waue, Surge after Surge to fly: Or as (we see) the Flowery Ears, in May (When Zephyrus with gentle Puffs doth play) Sway to and fro; forward and backward bend; Now stoop a little; and now, stand an end. Both Kings the-while, whose Force and Fortitude Far past their Subiects, so their Blades imbrewd In Bloud and Slaughter, that an open Glade Where-e'r they came, in either Camp they made: So that, nor Casks, Cuirets, nor Shields could saue From mighty Stroaks their massie Weapons gaue: Much like two Torrents, which with headlong fall From two opposed Hils, downe-bearing all, Banks, Bridges, Trees, Corn, Cattell; seeme to vy Whether of either shall most damnifie. Especially, the Medes King thundred so Vpon our Battailes, that our Bravest, tho, Began to shrink, and with that shameful sight, Our Hoast dis-ord'red, fell to shamefull flight: The Foe pursues, slayes, slashes (swift as wind) Millions of wounds, and every one behind. In briefe, that Day had Niniue bin downe, Her King vndone (dead, and depriv'd of Crowne) Had not I (full of Force and Furie) quick Like Lightning, rusht where deadly Blowes were thick. Mails, Murrions, Corselets, Iron, Steele and Brasse, Before My Sword were brittle all, as Glasse, And onely I, My hand alone, which lent More deaths then blowes, brought more astonishment Vnto Their Camp, then all Our Camp beside. Their Foot no longer could my Brunt abide: Their Horsmen, fainting, in their Saddles shake; Arms on their Backs, halts in their Bellies quake. Heer, with a down-right Blowe, from top to twist, I cleaue in sunder one that dar'd resist: There, I so deep dive in Another's minde, That neer two handfulls peers my Sword, behinde; So, that the Medes, now more then wauering, In th'heat of Fight, abandon All their King. Who, seeing him so betray'd, his Tresses tore, Retir'd to Ragau, all besmeard with gore: There, over-taen by Ours, He brauely fought; Mid thickest Darts a glorious Death he sought; Heawes, thunders, thrills, and of his Manly blowes Not one in vaine, not one amisse bestowes: But, yer He die, with quick, keen, Fauchin fel, He sends before, thousand stout Soules to Hell: So the fierce Tigre, compast every where With Men and Dogs, to Fury turns his Feare; Fights where he findes the greatest dangerly; Tears, tosses, kills; not, vnreueng'd to die. But, at the last, the vainly Valiant King, Wearie of killing, and of conquering, Thrilld with a thousand Darts, and wounded rife, Ended at once his lofty Rage and Life: And, falling, fares as doth a mighty Oake, Which, planted high vpon a massie Rock, A thousand times hath felt the Winds to beat, And thousand Axes, it a Fall to threat; So that the Root groan'd, and the Valley nigh Eccho'd the noyse vnto the steepest Sky, While that the Top still reeling to and fro, Now, These, now Those, threatens with overthrow Yet, still it stands in spight of all their spight, Till at the last, all vnder-mined quight With million stroaks, it falls; and with the Fall, Bears to the ground, Trees, Rocks, Corn, Cattell, All. For, Arphaxat extinct, extinct with-all Was Median's glory: and, My Lord of All Raz'd Ecbatane; and now grow VVeeds and Grass VVhere, late, His lofty, rare-rich Palace was: Where, late the Lute, and the loud Cornets noise In curious Consort warbled sweet their voice; The voice of Scriech-Owles, and Night-Ravens is heard, And euery fatall and affrighting Bird. My King-God, weary of Warrs tedious toile, In Ninive the great, for foure months-while Made Publique Feasts: and, when the Feast was don, Commaunds Mee leavie a huge Hoast, anon, Of chiefest Men; to goe and chastise Those That had disdaignd him Aide against his Foes: And that, on All that dar'd His Hests infrenge, VVith Fire and Sword his Honor I avenge; And that with speed. But, Madam, see (alas!) How farre I am from bringing this too-passe: For, comming heere, your Nation to subdue, My Selfe am conquer'd and subdu'd by You: So that (alas!) Death's draddest Tyrannies In endlesse Night will soon siel-vp mine eyes, Except the powerfull sole Preservatiue Of thy sweet Kisses keepe mee yet aliue. Nay: good My Lord, said Shee, Tell-on (I pray) Your good Successe and Service, by the VVay. Then Holofernes, where he left, began A long Narration how He playd the Man; Halfe Truth, halfe Tales: For, tis great Souldiers guise To bumbast oft their Own Exploits with Lyes Mine Hoast all mustered and together brought, T'inflame their harts with martial Heat I sought: Fellowes (said I) if euer Your Desires Haue thirsted Fame, to liue when Life expires; Go w' now to punish that presumptuous Crew Which rudely (late) our sacred Legats slew: Go w', to avenge our drad-deer Soverain Liege Of that fel Outrage, nay, foule Sacrilege Against the Greatest God came euer downe From Heav'nly Spheares to sway an Earthly Crown Arm, arm you, braue Blouds, arm your either hand; This, with a Blade; That, with a Fier-brand, With Fire and Sword to over-run the West, To lay it waste, to bear away the best: To sink it all vnder a Crimsin Flood; Or make (at least) your Horses swim in blood: Go w', take possession of Your Valors due, The whole Worlds Crown, which yeelds it all to you: Take you This Honor; which, in Time-to-come, Shall keep your braue Names from th'obliuious Tomb: Take, take your pleasures of the richest spoils Of richest Cities in a hundred Soiles VVhich you shal sack. So, may you once in Health Come laden home with Honor and with VVealth. I ceast: and soon they second, all, my voice With Caps cast-vp, with clapped hands; and noyse Of generall Ioy, to haue Me Generall. Some six-score Thousand was Mine Hoast in all, Or som-what-more: with which from Ninive, But three-dayes march I made to Bectileh; Thence past I forward by Hierapolis, Then by Amida, then by Nisibis. And thence to Charan (at the length) I came, Once happy seat of your great Abraham. Then wan I th'Hill, whose oblique Horns divide All Asia neer, and limite farre and wide Many large Empires: Where, I sack, I slay, I burn, I raze, what-euer in my way: My Souldiers seem so many Mowers, right, Which in a Mead leaue not a blade vpright; But, by long Swathes of their degraded Grasse, Well showe the way their sweeping Sythes did passe: This, Phul, and Tharsis, and all Lydia knowes, In whose waste Fields now only Bramble growes. Com'n neer the Straight which serues for Wall and Fort To soft Phœnicians, and Thiefe Issians Port: The Rosians, Soleans Mopsians, Tharsians, Issia, Anchials, Ægœans; briefely, all Cilicia, Take-vp this Gate, with all their Power; in hope To stay my Passage, and my Course to stop. Should I heer tell the dangerous Enterprises Braue Charges, Rescues, Sallyes, Shocks, Surprises, Which there befell, the day would faile (I feare) Before my Speech: for, the Cilicians were So fortifi'd by fauour of the Place, That little could wee there preuaile, a space: Nay, all mine Hoast, which had so often chas't So many greater Hoasts; now stood agast; Till in despight, and full of desperate rage, In thickest dangers, I my Selfe ingage; Where, round assaild, and wounded in all parts, My Shield thick bristled with a Groue of Darts, I neuer shrunk: but so be-stirr'd mee round, That I alone made All their Hoast giue ground. Mine Army then, followes the way amain Mine Arm had made, and paved thick with Slain: Now our most Cowards (late) for Fear, adying; Wound most, kil most, and most pursue them flying. Cydnus, yer while for his pure silver Flood, Cald King of Waters, wallowes now in blood: And rapid Pyram (past his wonted Toule) To Neptune, Shields, Helms, Horse and Men doth roule. In brief, as heer your Mocmur stopt a while By some new Bridge, or some vnusuall Pile; Roars, rises, fomes, fumes, threats, beats, rages, raves, Against his new Bank; and with waighty Waves Waighty and strong, beares down at last the Bay, And for a time, out-lashing every-way, Tears, over-turns, and vndermines, much worse Then when he freely hath his natiue Course: Even so my Force, having the Force repeld, Which in these Straights the struggling Passage held; Burns, kils, confounds, what meets it most and least. Asia, laid waste: returning to the East, I conquer'd Cœle, spoyling, pityless, The fruitfull Verge of famous Euphrates: Rapsis I raz'd and Agræa, overthrow'n, The Vertue of my mighty Arm hath know'n. Thence, keeping still by the Sea coast, I spoile The Madianites: then, marching North a-while, Towards double Liban, I Damascus race, VVith her neer Towns, Gaane, Abyle, Hypæpas: Thence came I (curious) to that Hill, from whence The Sun, by Night, is seen; and seen from thence Also to Rise: Thence, towards the Western Realms Continual beaten with Phœnician Streams. Then, Those of Gaze, Tyre, Sydon, Ascalon, Azotus, Byblus, Ioppa, every-one, Fear'd with my Fame; in greatest humblenes, Dispatch their Legates to My Mightiness. We come not heer with Force and Arms (say They) To bid thee Battail, or to barre thy Way: But rather, Mightiest Prince, in humblest awe, To yeeld vs Thine, to accept Thy Will for Law; Of Life, or Death. Thine are our Fields and Forts; Thine are our Cities: Thine our Ships, our Ports, Our Lands, our Goods, our Cattail, Corn, and Wine; Thine are our Children, and our Selues are Thine: Only be pleas'd (Sir) to accept vs so, And so esteem vs: and right happy tho Shall we esteem our Selues, to haue a Lord Can wield so well the Sceptre and the Sword, The Lance and Balance; and, besides, excels Men, equals Gods in euery Vertue else. Nor did their People, nor their States disproue Their Embassies; but by all signes of Loue Both Yong and Old, crown'd all with Flora's Fauors, Of hundred Colours and of hundred Sauors; Came Dancing out with Musiks cheerfull Moods, To offer Me their Bodies and their Goods. Nor did I then a Victor's Right abuse; But with all Kindness them as Friends I vse: Leaue them their Land: but first, their Forts I mand With some of Mine; with some of Theirs, my Band. For (Madame) still the farther that I go, My Camp, in Bands; my Bands in Soldiers growe: Euen as Danubius, first, beginning small Through Raurak Plains with shallow course to craule, Still swelling more and more, with three-score Riuers, To th'Euxin Sea his Sea-like Self deliuers. I hop't, as These, so also Israel Would yeeld themselues; and not at all compel My iust Reuenge to threat Extreamities: But, when I came heer to Scythopolis (The Toomb of Her whose happy Milk had yerst The twice-born Dennis in his Cradle nourç't) I was aduertis'd of this stubborn Folly; Which will, no doubt, vndoo the Hebrews wholly. The end of the fift Booke. The Sixt Booke. Yer that the Pagan could his Story end, From highest Hils did dusky Night descend: And now the Steward full the Table fraights With all, most pretious, most delicious Meats; As if the Vice-Roy, to This Iouiall Feast, Had bid the Kings both of the West and East. O greedy-guts! O Gulphs insatiate! A thousand Worlds, with all their delicate And various Cates deuis'd by th'Abderite, Cannot suffize your bound-less Appetite. O Belly-gods! for You (at any price) To the Moluques, must we trudge for Spice; To the Canaries, for your Sugars fine; To (Ioves-Crete) Candy for your choysest Wine. To please your Tastes, your Palats to content, Seas sacred Bosome is profanely rent; Aire is dispeopled; yea right hardly can The only Phœnix scape the Iawes of Man. O Poison! worse then Plague to Martiall states, Which brauest mindes basely effeminates While Rome, for Heads, had Curio's and Fabricio's, Whom Roots suffiz'd for dainties most delicious: While Persia was with Sallets sole content; They flourisht Both, admir'd and Eminent; And Eithers Arms, triumphing euery-where, Fill'd all the Earth with Tropheis and with Fear: But, since that This, from soft Assyrians took His vast Excesse of Kitchin and of Cook; And, since that That fel vnder the Dispose Of Galba's, Neros, and Vitellios (More glorying to exceed Others Excess Then conquer Pyrrhus or Mithridates) Both haue bin oft and iustly sackt and spoil'd By pettie Nations, whom they oft had foil'd. Nature's suffiz'd with Little: Ouer-ful Deadeth the Courage, and the Wits doth dull. Each being set; anon, full filled-out In massie Boules the Molmsey walks about: One drinks deuoutly in an Estridge Egge; One in a Lute, another in a Legge; One in a Ship, another in a Shell; Another takes a broad deep siluer Bell, To ring his Peal: but so his hand doth sway And shake, that half he sheds it, by the way. But, aboue all, the Prince him so behau'd, That, now, the more he drank the more he crau'd: Much like the Sea; which, though it take this-while Twin-named Ister, and Seauen-mouthed Nile; Neuer increases, nor is full therefore; But euer ready for as many more. Cup calls for Cup; and when the Skinker weens T'haue done his Seruice, he afresh begins To fill them Liquor: for, till Midnight past, Among the Guests this Tippling game did last. And then away, with much adoo, they went (Feeling, and reeling) Each vnto his Tent; By th'amorous Tyrant often vrg'd before, Who thought each minute now a yeare and more. When they were gon, Hee 'gan embrace and busse The trembling Lady; who besoothes him Thus: Nay: leaue (my Lord) such haste what need you make To reap the Fruit which from you none can take? Get you to bed: and, if you leaue me roome, I will not faile you by and by to come, So soon as I haue but disburthened My Load of Cloathes, and made me fit for Bed. If suttlest Wits, and if the sobrest Brains, Haue hardly scaped Womens wylie Trains, Maruaile not, Reader, if One, fool'd at-once By Semele's and Cytherea's Sonnes, Be thus beguil'd: sith Either of the Two Bereaues the Bodie's and the Mindes Force, too. Then, letting her slide from his arms away, He goes about himselfe to dis-aray: Now he vnbuttons, now pulls-off his hose; But, his heat hinders, and his haste foreslowes; For (sleep-awake, blinde-seeing) while he plyes T'vntrusse his Points, them (fumbling) faster ties: Till, ouer come with Rage, and Longing, more, He cuts his knots, and off his Cloathes he tore; And then to Bed. Where (as the Crosse-bowe-man, Who, for his pleasure, watcheth now and than, By some Cross-path, some Coney, or some Hare; At euery Noise, on euery side doth stare Where stirs a Leaf; and leuels thither-ward, At the least Wren, or the least Worm that stird Neer where he stands, still in a Hopefull-Doubt Turning his Body and his Bowe about) The lustfull Tyrant, if he hear a Mouse Neuer so little stir about the house; Shivering for Ioy, he thinks his Mistresse there: Nay, though he nothing heare, his flattring Eare Thinks it hears something, which can nothing be But this admired most desired Shee: Lifts vp, layes-down, and vp again re-lifts His heauie Noule: from side to side he shifts; Casting the Distance, counting in his head, How many steps will bring her to his Bed, The which the-while he full of Thorns doth think. But, now the Fume of his aboundant Drink, Drouzing his Brain, beginneth to deface The sweet Remembrance of her louely Face: Alreadie wheels his Bed, alreadie shine A thousand Rayes before his slumbring Eyne: Alreadie in his Eares (now waxen numme) A thousand Drones with buzzing Noise do humme: He sees Chiméras, Gorgons, Mino-Taures, Medusas, Haggs, Alectos, Semi-Taures. But Ivdith's heart still beating thick with-in, Felt a fell Combat in it self begin; Now, causing Fear her sacred Fervour quash; Anon, her Fervour her faint Fear to dash. Ivdith said She, Thy Iacob to deliuer, Now, is the Time; Now to-it. Do-it neuer. O! Yes. O! No. I will. I will not, I: Shall I profane kinde Hospitality? Nay, rather shall I sanctifi't the more, When by the same I shall the Saints restore. But, Traitors euer bear Dishonors, brand. Traitors be Those betray; not save, their Land. But, Murderers Heau'ns righteous Iudge abhors. Why? all Man-killers are not Murtherers. But Hee's a Murderer who his Prince hath slain. This is a Tyrant; not My Soverain. But, GOD hath now bequeath'd him vs for Lord. Hee's not of GOD that wars against his Word. Why, then, may All their Tyrants kill and rid? So Ahod Iahel, and so Iehu did. Yea, but from Heau'n had They autentik Warrant. So hath my Soule (approued and apparant.) But, ah! how weake art Thou this Work to act! Whom God assisted, neuer strength hath lackt. But, hadst thou done, the Sequel's more to doubt. GOD brought me in: and GOD will bring me out. What if He please leaue thee in Heathen's hands? Their Chieftain dead, I fear nor Death, nor Bands. But to their Lust thou shalt be lest a Pray. Neuer my Minde; my Body force they may. Then, in this point thus sacredly confirm'd; With hands heav'd vp, her eies on Heav'n she firm'd; And softly, Thus poures to the Lord her Prayer: O gracious GOD, who with paternal Care Hast euer kept thine Israel, strengthen Thou Mine Arm with Thine, that it may nimbly now Cut-off this Tyrant, who thus dares presume, To scale the Heav'ns; Thy Sceptre to assume. And, sith thy grace, through thousand storms and more, Hath brought my Bark in sight of wished shore, O, let it land: with Poppie's sleepiest sap This Tyrant's sense benum in end-less Nap; That I may raise this Siege, Thy Thralls release, Return Thee Praise; and to thy SION, Peace. Her Praier done, the Drunken Prince she heares Snorting aloud. Then faire and soft She neeres His Palle's side, and quickly takes the Sword Which had so oft the groaning Earth begor'd. But, euen about the fatal Blowe to giue; Fear, from her hand did the fel VVeapon reaue: Her hart did faint, her strength did fail her quite. O GOD (then said She) strengthen by Thy Might My timerous heart's and trembling hand's Consent. Then on the Duke so stitle a stroake she lent, As happily, tri-parted (at the poule) Th'Head from the Body, Body from the Soule. His Soule to Hell: his Body on the Bed: In Ivdith's hand his grim and ghastly Head; Which soon her Handmaid in her Night-bag hid. Then speeding thence, suspect-less, or vnspi'd; Without Impeach the Pagan Hoste they past. For if that any saw them trip so fast, Heav'n-blinde, they thought She went but (as before) Into the Vale, bright Diane to adore. Now, when chaste Ivdith came to th'Hebrews Tower, Ope open (said She): for the God of Power, Th'Assyrian Forces hath this Night forlorn, And lifted vp his chosen Iacob's Horn. The Town, amaz'd at her Return vn-hop't, Presse to the Port; which instantly they op't, Thronging about her: who a Tarras mounts, And her Exploit from point to point recounts. Then, from her Bag, for Proof of what she said, She pulls the-while the dreadfull Pagans Head. The Citizens, when in her hand they sawe Th'Assyrian's Head's Head; full of humble Awe, Extoll th'Almighty, who so mighty Foe By a weak Woman had subdewed so. But, most of all did Ammons Prince admire GOD's dreadfull Iudgement: and to scape His ire, Who Israel thus, of vanquisht, victoriz'd; His Flesh and Heart he sodain circumciz'd. How sweetly, Lord, Thy sacred Prouidence, Mens suttlest Wisdome, in their Plots, preuents! For, thine Elected vnto Life, to guide Into thy Fold (when most they seem beside) Good out of Ill thou draw'st; making their Sin, Means ('gainst their minds) their Goodnes to begin. Lord! foule desire of Murther and of Spoile Brought this (late) Pagan to th'Isacian Soile; VVhere, meaning (first) Thy Peoples bloud to spill, Now, spend his Owne for their deer sakes he will: Thy mercy so from his maligne Affect, Maugre his minde, brought forth a good Effect. So, neer Damascus, mad'st thou, by thy Call, Of Wolf a Shepheard, of a Saule a Paule; Of Persecutor, an Apostle; (brief) Of Chief of Sinners, among Saints the Chief: So sodainly, that all the Saints about Admir'd his Doctrine; Yet, his Deeds did doubt. So, the Saint- Thief, which suffered with our Sauior, Was led to Life by his Death-dew Behauior: And, when no longer Earth could bear his Sin, Was, in a Moment, made Heau'ns Citizen. (O feareful-hopeful Precedent of Grace! Such as, but One, GOD's holy Books imbrace: One, that None (humbled) should despaire of Pardon: But One, that None presume in Sin to harden.) So, turn, good Lord, O turn the hearts of Princes, Whose Rage their realms with Saints deer bloud berinses: O! let the Sword, Thou in their hand hast put, None but Thy Foes, none but Those Tyrants cut, Who cursedly Thee or Thy CHRIST blaspheme (Vsurping IVDA and IERVSALEM, And all Thy Goulden Candlesticks beside; Threating the West, too, with their Power and Pride): Not Those, who humbly, only, euermore, Thee, TRINITY in VNITY, adore. Then, as the braue Virago ordered, A Soldier takes th'Assyrian Tyrants Head; And, for the Hebrews more Encouragement, Glad sets it vp vpon the Battlement. There, Parents, Children, Maids, and VVidowes sad, Whom Pagan Swords but new bereaued had Of Children, Parents, Louers, Husbands deer, Twixt Grief and Anger, as distracted neer, Pull-off his Beard, pull out his hatefull Tongue, (Which had blasphemed Heau'n and Earth so long) Spet in his Face, scratch and poach-out his Eyes; And all, that Hate and Fury can deuise. For, lyue Remembrings of their wrongs, them make, On his dead Head, this dead Reuenge to take. Aurora, weary of the cold Embrace Of her old Spouse, began in Iude apace To paint her Portal of an Opal hew; When, of Bethulians all the brauest Crew Issue in Armes: and such a Noise withall, (Such Shouts and Cries) as if, in th'antike Braule, All th'Elements, breaking the bands of Order, Were by the Eares; and in their old Disorder. The Court of Guard (that night vnusuall strong, Towards the Town) hearing such Noise, so long, Start from their Sleep; and crying Arm, arm, arm, Giue sodainly to all their Host Alarm. One, for his owne, his Fellowes Helm puts-on: One, his right Vantbras on left arm doth don: One, on his neck, for Launce, a Libbet takes: One speeds him quick: another scarce awakes: One mounts his Horse, yer he be curb'd, or girt; And, without Spurs: Others, to shew more heart, Would make a Stand: some neither wake nor sleep: Some, braue in Word; in Deed, as faint as Sheep. Now, by degrees, this Noise comes to the Eares Of Holophernez Houshold Officers: So that sad Bagos hies him in all hast Vnto the Tent where th'Ethnick slept his last. With trembling hand, once, twice, or thrice he knockt: But an eternall Sleep the Doors had lockt Of his Lord's eares; who had already crost The Stygian Ferry, not to be re-crost. Then, hearing still th'Isacians lowder shout, He makes the Doore fly-open with his Foot; And, entring, findes, in gorie Bed, lowe shrunk, Not Holofernez, but his Head-less Trunk. Then did he teare his haire, and rent his Clothes, And to the Clowds roars out in yelling Oathes: Especially, when Ivdith there he mist, Whom now the Murdress of his Lord he wist. Then, ragefull rushing from the bloody Tent, This hideous Cry through all the Camp he sent: Woe, woe to vs! Alas! this cursed Night, A cursed Captiue hath confounded quight Our awefull Army, and vndone vs All, By treacherous slaughter of our GENERAL. This new Affright, redoubled on the first, The stoutest harts doth so dis-hart and burst, That all (at-once abandoning their Armes, Pikes, Swords, and Shields, Darts, Arrowes, all) by swarms, Betake them to their heels; o'r Hill and Dale, Flying from one death, on a worse to fall. Then the Besieged, in great Troops descend, And on their backs revenging Bowes they bend. Both run apace; Those fly; These follow fast: But those that fly, make lesse good speed then haste. For, without losse of Man, th'Hebrews, at will, The flying Pagans slaughter, thrash and thrill: Euen as a Lyon, in Getulian Lawnes, Bestreawes the soile with fearfull Kids and Fawnes; Where, not a beast his Furie dares abide, Nor lift a horne against his awefull pride. One, from a Rock himselfe doth headlong dash, And all to peeces all his parts doth pash: Other, forgetting that in deepest depth Fate findes vs out, into a Riuer leap'th. But, if by speed, or some good hap, perhaps This Mornings first fel Fury any scapes, He scapes not though those Hebrews outrages, Who kept (about) the Straits and Passages: So that scarce one of such a Rout could bring, To Niniue, the Newes vnto the King. The Battaile (rather, th'Execution) don, Out of the Citie flocked euery one Whom Sex or Age had hitherto restrain'd; To see the drad Revenge the Lord had rain'd So suddainly, and past all Expectation, On those fell Foes of His deer Holy Nation. One, full of Wounds, yet gasping calls in vain On lazie Death, to end his lingering paine: One, grinning gastly, in his visage grim, Showes, dead, the Rage that liuing sweld in him: Some mangled heer, some there, some round about: And euery Soule a sundry way went out: Accordingly as Valor, Sleight, or Chance, Led the dead-doing Sword, or Dart, or Launce. In short, This sight so truly tragick was, That even the Victors would haue sigh't, alas, Had they so vanquisht any Foe but This. But rifling long, among the Carcases, At last the Body of the Duke they found (Though head-less, known best, by that only wound). Thither they throng; That, euery blade must thrill, And euery one that Corps againe would kill: A hundred Swords, a hundred Pikes, and Darts, Are euery moment goring all his parts; And euery Nerue, Vein, Muscle, Ioynt they hack; Till room (at last) their Vulgar Rage doth lack. For, were his Bulk as big as Atlasses, His Limbes as many as Encelades, And strong Briareus; yet, yet think I, all, Their dire Revenge would still, still think too small. For, of the Iewes, none so base Clown there is But would a Gobbet of that Flesh of His. Giue, Tyrant, giue thy Right hand to Cilicians, Thy Left to Medes: giue one Arme to Phœnicians, Th'other to Ismael: and divide thy Feet Between th'Egyptian and the Cœlianite; That euery Nation, whom Thine Arms offenç't, May, by some Part, be partly recompenç't. Alas! I erre: for, all in Atomies Wert Thou divided, all would not suffise. But Ivdith, nor forgetful, nor ingrate, Would neither bury, nor Selfe-arrogate The sacred honor for Assistance given In This great Work, by th'All-work hand of Heav'n: But, tyming meet her Feet to Timbrells noise, This Hymn she sings with glad-sad warbling voice; Follow'd by all the Flower of Hebrew Dames (Maids, Widowes, Wiues) of Faultless Forms and Fames. Laude, laude we, lowd with verse, with voice and strings, The GOD of GOD's, the glorious King of Kings: Whose Power, alone, pulls Tyrants down, and reareth Meek in their Room, who HIM ay-faithfull feareth. For, who would thinke, one Citie, in one Day, So suddainly could such an Hoast dismay, Whose high Exploits had all the World astounded, And, from the Indes, to Iapheths Inns resounded? Lord! who would think, that Holofernes, late Proud Conqueror of many a Potentate, Should lose his Life (for all his Selfe-affiance) By one weak Woman, not a Troop of Giants? Who, who would thinke, that HE, who late possest (At least, had power) from farthest East to West, From Pole to Pole stretching his arms all-over, Should not haue, left, one Inch of Turfe, for Cover? That stately Prince, so thick attended-on, Now dead (alas!) lyes, aboue ground alone; Yet, not alone: for, Those that seru'd him, living; Consort him, dead; Proofe of their Duties giving: Nor yet, aboue ground; for, the Ravens become His mingled Bodie's better-worthy Toomb, Then pretious Marble, let, and Iacynth gilded; Which, for his Bones Himselfe had proudly builded. So so (good Lord) from Hence-forth let vs finde Thee, not our Iudge, but as our Father kinde; And so, Hence-forth the Foes of SION rather Feele Thee their Iudge then their propitious Father. Heere Ivdith ends: Heer also end will I, With thanks to GOD; and to Your Maiestie. To GOD, for bringing This my Work about: To You, for daigning to haue read it out. FINIS. A HYMN OF ALMS: OR THE BEGGERS BELL; heard, from beyond THE CHARTER-HOVSE, To ring All-in, To The Temple of CHARITIE; In an Eccho Iterated, &amp; Consecrated To The right-right Reuerend and Double-Honorable Father, George Abbot, L. Arch-Bishop of Canterbury. &amp;c. By Iosvah Sylvester. TO MY LORD OF CANTERBURY His Grace. My Wit, weak Orphan, weaned too-too-yong From Pallas Brest, and too-too-Truant-bred (Not, as too-wanton, but too-wanting) led From Arts, to Marts (and Miseries among) Had else perhaps (besides du Bartas) sung Some natiue Strains the grauest might haue read; And to your Grace now grately tendered Some fitter Sound then This rude Bell hath rung: Yet; sith it tends to drown th'Heav'n-reaching Cry Of Blood heer shed by Luxe and Auarice; And to awake the World to Charitie (Whereof Your Life so liuely Pattern is) Propitious, pardon mine officious Zeale, In This lowd Eccho of a lowder Peale.

Eiusdem Præconis disertissimi ANAGRAMMA. Iohannes King. Oh, Igni-Canens! A HYMN OF ALMS. Alms (holy Gift, vouchsafed from above) Is a sure Pledge and Symbole of that Love, Which God, just Steward, as a Deaw pours-out. On Earth, expos'd to empty Air about: For, from this Vnion, from this constant League, From time to time Mankinde doth duely beg All that the Sun imparts his powrs vnto, Of living Creatures, and vn-living too: So that, our Beeing, Begging may wee call; Sith, of her Maker, Nature borrows all: 'Gainst Vsurers, and Churles Vnthankfulnes, Who to Christ's Members shew them Mercy-less. Hee that, for God, but a good Motion hath, Guiding his Minde vp to the Milky Path, T'admire there (nameless) what hee cannot knowe By th'ey of Reason (where yet shineth though The Sun of Righteousnes; as th'vsuall Sun Through Crannies shines into a Dungeon:) Hee, Hee (I say) that hath but Nature's sense, For Faith; for Law, but native Innocence; In his simplicity hath alwaies care To practise Alms, Alms to receive and share: So common 't is with sociable Man To give and take the mutuall Alms hee can; Yea, in our Cradles, yer our Tongues can crave, Wee beg with Cries what wee had need to have. The Heav'ns, dispensing sacred Influences, Predominant in Birth of Poor and Princes, Aboundantly (with bountious Over-plus) Pour th'Hebrews Manna, many waies, on Vs; To teach, that Wee, by sundry Charities, Should mildely ease each others Miseries. Even as the Opal, in his orient lustre, Where various colours of all Stones doo muster, Shewes the rare Riches of the Pearly East; Alms is The Glass of wel-bred soules and blest, Shewing each other Vertue's sacred Quality, In the Heav'n-allied Man of Liberality. Alms are the Cæment of this round Theater: Where, in a differing kinde, Earth, Air and Water, Intend the same thing; liberally to give Their Alms to Rocks, Plants, Creatures all that live, Conducing Fire withall, whose Force vnseen Gives frankly, too, his helpfull Heat between. Alms, in our Bodies worketh all in all: Th'Eies lend it Light; the Hands, most liberal Laborious Almners, bring home to the Head All needfull Store wherewith the Whole is fed: The Feet supply it with their meet Support; And each, each other, as their Parts comport: The Liver, Nurse of Naturall Faculties, First warms, then feeds, the Nerves, Veins, Arteries; Causing the Stomach (as His Alms) receive The Heat which first his vertue doth conceive: The spongy Lungs with gentle Sighes inspire The vitall Air our Little-Worlds require: Th'Heart, quick and ready, with Alms-vowed Vigor, Draws to it self (against extreamest Rigor, For vtmost Refuge) all our liveliest Heat, To succour Nature, when Death seems to threat: The Soule (solely divine) Life's motion brings To all the Members of This Thing of Things (Alms Heir apparant) to Whom, supream Sage, Heav'ns Almner gave the Earth for heritage; That, having free receiv'd so various Store, Hee should bee frank to th'Needy, Naked, Poor. Bee bountious Almners, said All Bounties Father; Y' are not heer Owners, but meer Stewards rather: I have ordain'd you to provide and care For th'Orphan, Poor, that vnprovided are. If, narrow-hearted, You shrink-in your hands From th'humble Begger that Your Alms demands, I'll make Your Goods (like water) leak away; Your Lands a Stranger shall inherit ay: Your Gold (your god) before you bee aware, Som barbarous Souldiers in your sight shall share: Your stately houses (stiled by your Names) Wars rage shall ruine, or som sudden Flames, Which I shall kindle (in my just displeasure) Against your Selves, your Seed, your Trust, your Treasure. The Mercy-less, with Mee, shall Mercy miss: That Vice alone all Vertues Poison is. Abram, Lot, Ioseph, Iob, were Almners all (To Strangers kinde, to Neighbours liberall) By sacred record, which renowns them more For this rare, Vertue, then All else of yore; As if, with God (the Author of all Good) Their chief perfection in this Function stood, Sole Soule of Vertues, second Life of all This various vast Orb, which the World wee call. Calling to record the Rein-searching Ey, Heer I protest, that in My Poverty (Though these dear Times daign Me so scant a Scope, That having Nothing, I can Nothing hope) Next my Home-charge (where Charity begins) My deepest Sighes (save for my Debts and Sinnes) Rise from Compassion and Desire to steed Others with Helps which yet my Self I need: To succour Others: to bee (like the Sun) Extending Light and Heat to Every-one: To bee to All, in som sort, necessary (For Vertues Meed, and not as mercenary): Rather to give, then take; to lend, then borrow; A Pound to-Night, then but a Crown to-Morrow: But, th'Heav'nly Wisdom (best, it Self knowes Why) Doth still th'Effect of This Affect deny, Denying Means aud Matter to express Mine inward Zeal to Alms and Thankfulnes; Which oft breaks out (without a Trumpet blowne) To give (God knowes) more then I knowe mine Owne (The more my Griefe) the less my Thought of Merit, Or Thirst of Praise, though heer I thus aver-it; By th'humble Proffer of so Poor a Mite, Th'aboundant Rich to Bounty to incite. Vain-glorious Almners are effeminate, Affecting Works, but to bee wondred-at; Whose Vertue is meer Vanity (indeed) And heer receives their momentary Meed: The Meritorious (such as ween them so) Indebting God to Them for what they doo; In stead of Heav'n, where Humble Soules abide, Shall purchase Hell, the Portion of their Pride. O! Thrice, thrice Happy Hee, whose free Desires To Charity a holy fervour fires: Who onely mindes GOD's Glory, by his Gift, And Neighbour's Good, without sinister Drift: Famine (familiar vnto Rogues that range) Shall not com neer his Garner, nor his Grange: His Fields, with Corn, abundant Crop shall cover, His Vines with Grapes, his Hedge with Roses over; His Downs with Sheep, his Daery-grounds with Neat; His Mounts with Kids, his Moors with Oxen great; His Groves with Droves (increasing Night and Day); His Hils with Heards, his smiling Meads with Hay; His Fens with Fowl, his Pils and Pools with Fish; His Trees with Fruits, with Plenty every Dish: Content and Health (the Best of Earthly Bliss) Shall evermore remain with Him and His: Him, Pride or Envy never shall molest; Or Corsive Care, Foe to Repast and Rest. For, th'All-see Ey still carefully respects The Almner's House, and ever it protects; Till finally, when Iustice endeth All, Sweet Mercie's Voice Him to Heav'ns Kingdom call. But, th'Vsurer (how-euer heer hee thrive In Heards and Hoords) already dead-alive (No Heat of Love, no Heart to give a Mite, Except to gain and gather double by't) Him, in That Day (to Him a Day of Woe) The Holy-One, th'All-Knower, will not knowe. Shame and Confusion shall be-spred him over, Wishing the Holes to hide, and Hills to cover: Eternall Fire shall fry his thirsty Veins; Immortall dying in eternall Pains. His Eyes, so nice to look on Lazars Sore, Shall swim in sulphury Tears (tortur'd the more, To see above, in Blisse and Glory rife, Whom, Ruth-less, heer hee would not see, in life): His Ears, heer deaf vnto distressed-ones, Shall there hear Horror of the Damned Grones: Nor shall the voice of Mercy Him salute, Who, in Effect, to Needy Mones was mute: Millions of Masses cannot him redeem, Nor all Church-Treasure ever ransom him, From all-thought-passing Pangs of Wretchednes; As, End-less, Ease-less, and Remedy-less. Alms are so vsuall in the Eastern parts, Where Heav'n, and Earth, and Air, improve their Parts, That every Village there, in Winters Need, Is wont the Flocks of Wildest Fowles to feed, And break the Ice (of purpose) for their drink, When crystall Crusts have glas'd the Waters brink: A Charity of Infidels to Fowles; Shaming som Christians, towards Christian Soules. Rich Anatolia, and her happy Coast (Th'abbridged Glass of all the World, almost) In her huge Cities (rather Shires wall'd-in) These hundred yeers hath not a Begger seen; (God's strict Edict they there observe so well, Forbidding Beggers in His Israel) Sith 't is misprision of the Law of Nature, Nay, impious Pride against our All Creator, To suffer Man (God's Image, and our Owne) Whom wee may succour, to bee overthrowne To stark for Cold, to starve for Food, to perish In Penury, when wee have power to cherish: For, in such Cases, where (wee knowe) wee can, There not to Comfort, is to Kill a Man. Yet, sole the Christian (Each a Wolf to other) Disdains to look on his Distressed Brother; And heer, in London [Coaching swiftly by; Or stalking on, with Self-survaying Ey; Or strutting out, to view his Purls or Lace; Or stepping-in, to see som painted Face, Or Fire-new Fashion of a Sleeve or Slop; Or to som Tavern, or Tobacco-Shop; Or towards Burn-Bull (if not Turnbull) Street; Or to Black-Friers, som White Nunnes to meet] At Doors, on Dunghils, vnder every Stall, Lets pined, sick poor, naked Christians fall, Faint, starve and dy; for lack but of the Price Of the least Cross of his last Cast at Dice; Or of the Tithe but of his Shoo-ties Cost; Or of the Spangles from his Garters lost; Or of his ietting the Canaries Iigg; Or of the puffing of his Periwig. O Times! O Manners! O mad, murderous Vanity, In Either Sex, of equall Inhumanity! The hideous Cries of the Afflicted, fright The sable Horrors of the silent Night; So that Shee, pearced with their pitious Case, Cloaths them with Clouds, and lends them Ease a space: The hollow Rocks, and hardest Marble Stones, Weep when they weep, and eccho with their Grones: Their Shivering Fits, their Fears, their Feavers make The Firmament, the fixed Poles, to shake: Yet heer (alas!) th'abundant Riotous Are neuer mov'd: much less the Couetous Rich, raking Wretch; the needy-greedy Chuff, Whose (Hel-like) heart can never have enough: Who rather grindes, then gives; and beggers many, Yer to a Begger hee affoord a Penny, Or penny-worth of All his plentious Store, When Bags, and Banks, and Barns, can hold no more. O Times! O Manners! O mad, murderous Vanity, In Yong and Old, of equall Inhumanity! But, pardon, London; I have over-slipt: I must recant, lest I bee stript and whipt. Christ-Church, S. Thomas, Bartholmew (My Friend) Bride-well and Bedlam, better Thee commend: Besides a many of peculiar Charges Of Companies; and more of Private Largess: And, above All, that black Swan (Svtton)'s Nest, (From One, alone almost worth All the rest) That new Zaccheus, who restored free Th'old Charter-house to better Charity. Are not These, Alms? Are not These, Monuments Of pious Zeal; of kinde Beneficence? I grant they are (Give God and Men their due): But, reverend Green-Staves, what's All This to You (Vnless, as Romists by implicit Creed, You hope for Heav'n, by Right of others Deed; Or swell with glory of your Elders Good: As self-Ignobles boast their Fathers Blood) That These few, dead, heer a few Hundreds cherish; If living, You let many Thousands perish; For want, perhaps, not of your Gift, but Gain; Which som, perhaps, from others Gifts restrain; Which (if time serve) when they can hould no more, They will (perhaps, the tenth-tenth-part) restore When they are dead; to build a Front for Five, Of those five Hundred they have starv'd, alive. O Times! O Manners! O mad, murderous Vanity, In Every Sort, of equall Inhumanity! Æthiops and Turks against Our Rich shall rise, That can behould with vnrelenting Eyes Poor, Aged, Sick, Soules gasping out their last; As little mooved, and no more agast Then is the Hunts-man, when a Deer at Bay Doubles, in vain, and windes to get away. During th'old Golden, happy, harmless, Age, When Saturn ruled (without Satan's Rage): When Reason sate as Iudge on every Throne: When Iustice shar'd justly to Each his owne: When Innocence was Cities Citadell: When Charity sole swaid the Common-weal: Then had the Heav'ns nothing but Alms for Ey: Then had the Earth (which now the Heav'ns defie) No other Heav'n then th'onely Mantle fair Of Alms, bestow'd by Water, Earth and Air, And Fire withall; from whose fell Nature, Alms Extracts the Fiercenes, and the Fury calms. Alms was the Word th'All-perfect Artist said, When, out of Almes, Hee bade, A Heav'n bee made: A fruitfull Earth: A Lightfull, Heatfull Fire: A Sighfull Air (though Soule-less) to respire: A moistfull Water, waving Changefully: A World (in briefe) full of all Quality. So that (in fine) of All This All-Theater, Alms is the Form, Almes is the primer Matter, So necessary for Our Lively-hood, That, after God, it is Man's Soverain-Good. Martha's and Marie's Alms (in Bounty rife) Restor'd their Brother to a second Life: Shee, who so free the Fire-Coacht Prophet fed, Found happy Guerdon; for (her Darling dead) Her Faithfull Alms, wingd with his fervent Praier, Re-brought the Breath of her Death-seized Heir. Alms is the Glew of Friendships permanence: Tis of all Vertues th'onely Quintessence: Against Heav'ns Anger, 't is an Anchor sure: Against Earth's Rage, a Rampire to endure: A Rock of Honour, against Slanders Arms: A Shield of Safety, against hurtful Charms. For, on the Man where pious Pity dwels, Malice can nothing with Thessalian Spels, Nor Traitor's Poignard, nor his Powder-Wit: Nor cunning mixture of a Murderous Bit: Nor secret Wiles of cheating Hypocrites: Nor privy Thieves, nor proud Monopolites: Nor ought, nor All, that Mischief can revolve To dare the Heav'ns, or Nature to dissolve. Alms calms the Windes, and gives them gentle breath: The War of Waves it quickly quieteth: From Shoals and Shelves, from where the Siren sings, The Almners Ship it swift and safely brings: When need requires, it Oars and Sails supplies; And, past the Pole, another Pole espies To steer his Course; if, what his heart doth vow Abroad, at home, his loyall hand allow In liberall Almes vnto the needy sort, At his Return into his wished Port. The Golden Table, that Great Pompey pilld From Salem, serv'd (as sacred Vengeance willd) For Sword to Cæsar: God so iealous is (Though Nought Hee needs) of what is vowed His. Th'High Threasurer of Asia's impious Rapt Within the Temple was with Horror wrapt: And, but th'High-Priest by praier succoured, The Sacrilegious had there perished. So may they speed, or worse then so, that spoil God's living Temples (by or Gripe, or Guile): That from their Pastor, or their Prince, detain The Tithe, or Tribute, sacred Lawes ordain: That from the Poor their ancient Rights conceal; Or, in their new, with Them vnjustly deal: That have, by secret sacrilegious Theft, Robd Church, or State, or holy Almes bereft: O! may they once, as high as Haman, mount; And from Mount Faulcon give a sad Account Of all the Wrongs (as Conscience them convinces) Don to their God, their Country, Peers and Princes While Great-ones, blinded, or as loth to spy, Had oft their Fingers in the Golden Py; For private Profit or peculiar Pleasure, Neglecting Poor, Publick's and Princes Threasure. O Times! O Manners, Most to bee deplor'd! O! sudden mend them, or soon end them, Lord. For, if poor France fall in an All-Consumption, Her Death's sad Crisis will bee This Presumption Of Private Lucre, without Publike Care; While Each, Self-serving, winks at Others Share. God, for his Mercy, grant My Fears bee vain; Or rid mee soon out of the Carefull Pain I suffer daily, while so few I see From This Corruption's foul Contagion free: Or, would I had been bred in humblest Thatch, Born of the loigns of one that Sprats doth catch; So poor in Wit, as not of power to knowe The impious Trains that Empires overthrowe: So, happily, more dull of head and heart, Lesse should I feel vn-feeling France's Smart; Who slaies her Self by Selfs-Disloyalties, Having no Foe but her Owne Avarice, With Pride her Partner, and Impunity, Their strong Abbettor: Which Triumviri Are able, sole, and soon, to ruinate And raze the Glory of the greatest State; Or bury 't quick i'th' Toomb of careless Princes That wink, or shrink, vnder their Insolences, Robbing them Selves of th'Honour and Renown Which Heav'ns entail vnto a happy Crown. But, if I can bee willing not to dy, 'T is out of hope, to see the Company Of Sacrilegious roundly go-to-pot, Expos'd in publike to som shamefull Lot, When our Great Hercules (All monsters Dread) Shall have cut-off the Golden Hydra's head; For an eternall Trophey of his Glory, An Argument of an Immortall Story. But, now return wee to our Theam, from whence Our Charity (through Zeal's too-Vehemence) Seems to have straid. Yet 'twas meer Alms did move My grieved Verse These Guilty to reprove; To turn their hearts to God, and to their King; Their private Heaps for publike Helps to bring, Against th'Ambition of som Foxy Foe, That by our Selves, our Selves would overthrowe; Not by his Arms, but by his Alms, to Som: For, golden Lances oft have overcom. Dear Patriots, that Spitefull Alms disdain, See Muses Fran. Ral fol. 482. Which brings you Crowns; but 't is Our Crown to gain: With Groves of Honours seems your brows t'imboss; But 't is to grace her Profit and your Loss: Which decks the Church, and doth the Masse adorn; But, by the Masse, 't is but to serve her Turn: Adores (in shew) both Peter's Chair and Keies; But, if they Ope and Shut not as shee please, Her Charity and Her Devotion dy: For, Her Religion is but Policy; Her Soule, but State; Her Life, but Rules-Desire; Whose Heat hath set all Europe on a Fire. Nilus (that serves for Rain to th'Abyssine, The light-foot Memphite, and the Canopine) Cools with his Alms the Choler's fervency In Earth and Air, which there the Sun doth fry: Waters the Plains, which Orion parcheth ay With twinkling Sparkles of his heatfull Ray: Tempers the torrid Æthiopian Zone: Seems to have Life, though it indeed have none, Save that of Almes; sole Cause efficient Of his fat Liquor, Africk's Nourishment. The Heav'ns, as Ielous of so Bountious Gifts, Would shut-vp Nile within Godonian Clifts: And Nature, envious of this Africk Prince His lavish Largess and Magnificence, Fronts him with Hils that seem to threat the Stars, (As if renewing the old Titans Wars) That one would think, amid the Mountains thick, Nilus were bay'd-vp, if not buried quick: But, by the Power which makes him charitable, Hee findes, that Alms to force the Heav'ns are able. Hee therefore, rushing, and out-roaring Thunder, Surrounds the Rocks that ween to keep him vnder; And with his swift Course breaks the Cataracts, Deafning withall the Parthians and the Bacts. Pactolus, Ganges, and the golden Tay, Not onely steep their Stronds, ennammeld gay With various Tinge of thousand Flowrs and more, Sowne on the surface of their winding Shore: But, for a richer Alms, they Gold bestowe, As needfull now, as Reason (well wee knowe) In This Gold-Iron Age; where, whoso wants All-mighty Gold, but Scorn and Scandal hants. When Androde fled his cruell Masters Fist, And cause-less Fury (but for Had-I-wist) Amid the horror of the Woods hee meets More Alms and Mercy, then in Romes proud streets: There found hee Man, to Man of brute Immanity; Heer findes hee Brutes of mildeness and humanity: His Lord there paid his Service but with Blowes; A Lion heer him double gratefull showes: Hee to the Beast had showne him serviceable; The Beast to Him seems much more charitable. For, having long with his Best Preyes maintain'd him, And in his Den, as dear Guest, entertain'd him, Hee (two yeers after) also saves his Life, Expos'd (in sport) to Fight and Fury rife Of Man, and Beast, whom (forced) hunger, there, Could never force, The Slave to touch or tear: But th'awfull Lion (which such Men may shame) Him safely rescues from Romes bloody Game. O noble Lion! thou hast brought to pass, I almost yeeld to old Pythagoras, In his Opinion of Metempsychosis, Trans-animation (so the Word composes) Of Soules deceast, to Bodies good or bad, As heer, Delight in Good or Ill they had. And durst I freely in his Doctrine wander, I should suppose Thee second Alexander; And that, a Beast, his Habits still are one As when a Man and King of Macedon. But, leaving Forrests, Floods, Fields, Earth and Air, Whose Almes already have appeared fair; Shall wee yet mount among the Wandring Seaven, And see how constant They to Alms are given? There shall wee finde Man's monstrous Self-resisting, Beeing made of Alms, all by meer Alms subsisting. Beasts, Birds and Plants, Roots, Reptiles, Daies and Nights, Have second Beeing from These Heav'nly Lights; From Whom our Selves, flat Beggers, borrow'd have The Best that makes our Worser part so brave: The Sea's their Subject, and th'All-bearing Earth Without their Alms can bring vs nothing forth. Saturn is kinde to Merchants, Mariners, Storm-wonted Fishers, stooping Labourers, Carefull House-holders, curious Architects; And every one that Gain with Pain respects. Milde Iupiter (more bountious) Beauty gives, Sweet gracefull Port, fresh Health (that happy lives) Almner of Vertues, storing Man with Graces Most Angel-like, and meet for highest Places: Kings, Counsellers, Lords, Princes, Magistrates, Hold, after God, of Him their High estates. Mars, surest Patrone of Sarmatians stout, Of part of Afrik, and the Southern Rout; Nigh daily gives them millions of Delights, And makes them naked make a thousand Fights. All Arts, wherein are Fire or Iron requir'd, Of his sole Alms are to our Life acquir'd. Sol's Soule of Alms; who, richly Liberall, Gives him to All, yet cannot give him All: Great Season-Bounder, artificiall Dresser Of Yeers and Daies, the even and onely Sessor Of Times rich Alms, which by his Heat hee varies, After the Innes wherein hee Monthly taries: His Bounty most is bent vnto Musicians, Bards, Poets, Leaches, Herbarists, Physicians. Venus, each Morning, with a gentle Ray Vshers the Sun, and summons vs away From lazy Beds (our Bodies living Graves) When Day begins to issue from the Waves. Her Alms goes chiefly to the preservation Of Nature's Powers, and Parts of Generation: Smooth smiles shee gives; sweet, cheerfull, charming Ein: Love is Her Gift; a Gift indeed divine. Quick Mercury, great Atlas's Daughter's Son, Wit's Treasurer, Well of Invention, Hee gives vs Arts, Knowledge, and Eloquence, Which steals vs oft from Reason and from Sense: A bountious Almner of Astronomy, Rare (for the most) vnto Man's feeble Ey; Who, yet, vnseen feels (almost every hour) Hundred Effects of its admired power; A Power which cannot bee sufficient showne By Verse or Voice (vnless by Hermes owne) For All that at this Day makes hunger fly (Gold, Silver, Brass) is drawn from Mercury. Cynthia, ador'd with hundred Fumes and Flames; Honour'd (abroad) by more then hundred Names; Shee gives vs Humors, more or less abounding, As in her Course her Fall or Full is rounding: Shee fashions Time; which Shee again defaces With constant Turns of her inconstant Faces: Shee swaies the Floods, and shewes (by Evidence) Her Self sole Law of liquid Elements: Shee forms, by Night, the fresh and fruitfull Deaw, Which every morning Flora's Buds doth streaw; Whose Purled Pearls are ever bigger found And more, the more Lucina waxeth round. In brief, All, given to Almes and Liberality, They All teach Man the same supernall Quality Towards the Needy that doth nought possess, And from his Cradle brought but wretchednes, But Sin and Death; had not Heav'ns Almes been shed In bloody Bath, to White This Monster's Red; A Monster, made of Earth, for Earth still burning, Although to Earth hee see him hourly turning. Yea, proudest Kings have had no other Birth Then poorest Beggers: Both begin of Earth: Both like in Cries, in Perils, and in Pain: Both alike Guilty in their Grand-Sires Stain: Both, as in Birth, so in their Death, alike: Both Kings and Beggers one same Dart doth strike: Both pass together, in one self same Boat, From th'arched Palace and the thatched Cote. So that, in Life what-ever Ods there bee; In Birth is None: None in their Death, wee see. Onely, the Good (of what Degree soever) Are free from Death; and, though they dy, dy never; Save to the Grief of Vertuous Soules (their Friends) Whom, to survive the Good, it heer offends: I mean, in Body, which a Death they hould, Or Toomb, or Prison, that doth Them with-hould From th'Happy Hav'n; and makes them less inclin'd To seek their God, and his strait Waies to finde. The Good are they, who not alone not wring; Who not alone not wrong, in any thing; Who not alone not hurt; but (from their heart) Doo Good to Others; and their Owne impart In liberall Almes vnto the Poor's Relief, After their power; as grieved with their Grief. Such shall not die, but to live ever Blessed: Such shall not live, but to die heer possessed Of Grace, and Glory with th'Eternal God, Author of Almes; and ever-scourging Rod Of Such Gold-heaped, Iron-hearted Wretches As to the Poor impart no part of Riches; Nor lend, Nor Lodge, nor clothe, nor free, nor feed Distressed Christ, in His deer Saints, that need. Such shall not live, but to dye double martyr'd: Such shall not dye, but to live ever tortur'd In Hell and Horror, without End, or Ease. Now, Worldlings, chuse You which you will of These. fine fine fines. MEMORIALS OF MORTALITIE. Written in Tablets, or Quatrains, By Piere Mathiev. The Second Centurie. Translated; and Dedicated To the Right Honourable, Henry Wriothesley, Earle of South-hampton, &amp;c. [Shall it be said (I shame, it should be thought)] Shall it be said (I shame, it should be thought) When After-Ages shall record Thy Worth; My sacred Muse hath left Sovth-hampton forth Of Her Record; to Whom so Much shee ought? Sith from Thy Town (where My Saravia taught) Her slender Pinions had their tender Birth; And all, the little all she hath of worth, Vnder Heav'ns Blessing, only Thence shee brought. For lack, therefore, of fitter Argument; And lother Now, it longer to delay; Heer while the Part of Philips Page I play) I consecrate This little Monument Of gratefull Homage, to Thy noble Bounty; And Thankefull loue to (My deer Nurse) Thy County. Humbly devoted Iosvah Sylvester. MEMORIALS OF MORTALITIE. 1 Let whoso list, think Death a dreadfull thing, And hold The Graue in horror and in hate: I think them, I, most worth the wel-comming; Where, end our Woes; our Ioyes initiate. 2 Man, Death abhors, repines, and murmurs at-her, Blind in that Law which made her good, for Him: Both Birth and Death the daughters are of Nature; In Whom is nought imperfect, strange, or grim. 3 Death's vgliness is but imagined; Vnder foule Vizard a faire Face Shee weares: Her vizard off, there is no more to dread; We laugh at Children whom a Vizard feares. 4 Death, in strange Postures daily is disguised, With Darts and Sythes in hand, Beers on her back: As Angels are with wings and locks devised; So, Her a Body of bare Bones they make. 5 Who fears this Death, is more then deadly sick; In midst of Life he seems even dead for dread; Death in his brest he bears, as buried Quick: For, feare of Death is worse then Death indeed. 6 Each fears this Death: and with an equall Dread, The Young as from a hideous Monster hie-them. Th'Old, at her sight shrink down into their Bed; All shun her aye, the more Shee draweth nigh-them. 7 What Good, or Bad, boads Life or Death, to giue; To be so fond of That, and This so flying? Thou would'st not die, yet know'st not how to liue; Not knowing, Life to be a liuing-dying. 8 One loues this Life, Another loathes it wholly: Som look for Ease, Promotion som, som Profit: To loue it, for the Pleasures heer, is Folly; Weakness, to hate it, for the Troubles of-it. 9 The Storm at Sea vnder a Calm is bred: Within Good-hap, Ill-hap hath life included; Begun in Tears, in Toils continued; And, without Dolour cannot be concluded. 10 Life, like a Taper, with the weakest Blasts Is waved, wasted, melted, puffed out: In som, somtimes, even to the Snuff it lasts; In others hardly to the halfe holds-out. 11 Fruit on the Trees first blooms, then buds, then growes, Then ripes, then rots: Such Our condition iust; Begot, born, bred, live, die; so roundly goes Times Wheel, to whirl our Bodies back to Dust. 12 This Life's a Tree, whose goodly Fruits are Men; One fals, Himselfe; Another's beaten down: It's stript at last of Leaues and Apples then, By Time's same hand which had them first bestown. 13 This Life's a Table, where, in earnest-iest Foure Gamsters play: Time, eldest, vantage takes, And biddeth Pass: Loue fondly sets his Rest: Man needs will see it; but, Death sweeps the stakes. 14 This Life (indeed) is but a Comœdie, Where This, the Kaiser playes; and That, the Clowne: But, Death still ends it in a Tragœdie, Without distinction of the Lord from Lowne. 15 This Life's a Warre, civill, and forrain too; Within, without, Man hath his Enemies: To keep the Fort, Death doth the Towne vndoo; To save the Soule, the Body Shee destroys. 16 The World's a Sea, the Galley is this Life, The Master, Time; the Pole, Hope promiseth; Fortune the Winde; the stormy Tempest, Strife; And Man the Rowe-Slave, to the Port of Death. 17 The World (me thinks) is like our Parliaments, Where Right too oft is over-born by Wrong; Where Quirks and Quidits are of Consequence; Where lastly nought Death's Sentence can prolong. 18 The World is much of a faire Mistress mood, Which, wily, makes more Fooles then Favourits; Hugs These, hates Those; yet will of all be woo'd: But never keeps the Promise that she plights. 19 Life's smoothest gloss is like the Sphear of Glass Archimedes framed, and fill'd with Stars; As traile as faire: fo, the least storm (alas!) That raps it, snaps it; and the Pleasure mars. 20 Th'Honor thou thirstest (as one Dropsie-sick) Weening to quaff it, often stops thy winde: 'T's a swelling Bladder; which when Death shall prick (Thou wilt confess) thou but a puff didst finde. 21 And that Ambition, which affords thee Wings To seek new Seas beyond Our Ocean's Arms, For Mounts of Gold and Pearle, and precious things; Shall not preserve thy Carcass from the Worms. 22 That Pleasure too, which stops thy Reasons eares Besots thy Soule, intoxicates thy Sense; And sad Repentance still behinde it bears; For moment Ioyes, leaves Sorrowes Monuments; 23 Pleasure which tires thee, but contents thee never, Thy Body wearing more than wearying: Like Danaides Sive-like Tub, a-filling ever, But never full for all their bucketing. 24 Beauty which makes the proudest Kings to crouch, Which serves the Soule as Letters in her favour; To see delightfull; Dangerous, to touch; From Death's drad Fury, may not, cannot save her. 25 But, Beauty, Grace-less, is a Saile-less Bark, A green-less Spring, a goodly light-less Room, A Sun-less Day, a Star-less Night and Dark; And yet this Grace cannot escape the Toomb. 26 When Bodie's Beauty with Soule's Beauty dwels, There's a Perfection passing all the rest: Without This; Beauty seems a Blemish else: Without That, Vertue seems not seemly drest. 27 That Beauty, which the Aire, Age, Ague quailes, Which busies so our Eyes, Tongues, hands and hearts; At fifteen, buds; at twenty, flowers; and failes, Or fals, at thirty, and to Dust reverts. 28 Gold, the Worlds God, the Sun of Plutoe's Sons; Whom Fire and Sword incessant serve so fell; Gold, Vertue's Friend, and Vices Fort at-once, Serves oft for Bridge to pass in post to Hell. 29 Man's Knowledge heer, is but meer Ignorance: We see the wisest foulely stumble oft: Learning is puft with Doubtfull Arrogance: And Truth is lost while it is too-much sought. 30 With Mysteries the Idiot meddles most; Peeps into Heav'n, into Kings Counsels pries: In Pulpit Phormio doth darrain an Host: Thersites prates of Arms and Policies. 31 Th'Assyrian's Empire is now seen no more; The Medes and Persians did the Greeks intombe: Great Alexander's Kingdom kinged Foure: Whose Crownes, in fine, stoopt to the State of Rome. 32 Where are Those Monarchs, mighty Conquerors, Whose brows ere-while the whole Worlds Laurell drest, When Sea and Land could show no Land but Theirs? Now, of it All, only Seaven Hils do rest. 33 Where are Those Cities (great and goodly States) Of Ninive, with thrice fiue hundred Towers? Great Babylon? Thebes, with a hundred Gates? Carthage (Rome's Rivall) Didoe's dearest Bowers? 34 All These huge Buildings, These proud Piles (alas!) Which seem'd to threaten, Heav'n it selfe to scale; Have now given place to Forrests, Groves, and Grass; And Time hath chang'd their Names and Place withall. 35 Nay, wilt thou see, how-far Great Kings are foild? See how somtime in Gold they swallow Poyson: See Ptolomeus Cross't, Boleslas boild, Baiazeth in a Cage, Richard in Prison. 36 See, see a Prince, neer Cairo flayed quick: See Sapores by his proud Victor trod: See Monk-like shav'n our Cloistred Childerick: See Denis beare, for Sceptre, Pedant's Rod. 37 See Gordian there in his owne Girdle hung: See Phocas bones broken with furious Bats: See Diomede to his owne Horses flung: To Wolves Licaon, Popiel to Rats. 38 See, see proud Salmon sudden Thunder-slaine: See Theodorick with horrid Terror thrild: See Longuemare hangd in a golden Chain; See a fierce Courser dragging Brunechild. 39 See Attalus, having for Court, a Forge: See Phalaris burnt in Perillus Bull: See Memprice left the greedy Wolves to gorge: Cambyses Sword sheath'd in Him-selfe too full. 40 Who but will feare amid the Frights of France; Seeing how Death Two Henries reft of Life? The Sire, in Paris, with a splinterd Lance; The Son, before it with a poysoned Knife. 41 That Queen, whose Court was in a Castle coopt, (A Prisoner, heer; above, a Princess, hop't.) Whose royall Throne to a Tragick Scaffold stoopt, Her Head she felt with whiffing steel off-chopt. 42 That King, who could within his Kingdoms drad, See Sol still shine, when hence he vanisheth; Who past Our Seas, another Empire had, For All he had, had but a louzie Death. 43 Who more his Garden of Salona priz'd Than Rome's great Empire and the Worlds Command, Knew well the Cares from Crowns insepariz'd; And Scepters sad Waight in the strongest hand. 44 Towards our End insensible we slip: For, speaking, sporting, laughing, snoring deep, Death still drawes on-wards: as at Sea the Ship Sails to her Hav'n-ward, though the Master sleep. 45 Death Each-where kils: in hunting, Carloman; In's Cave, Caligula; Aristobulus, In Bath; by th'Altar, Philip; Iulian, In Camp; in Councell, conquering Iulius. 46 Death seeks th'Æmathian; and from Nero flies: One in a Shallow drownes, who Seas did scape: An Emperour in eating Mushroms dies: A Holy-Father in a Harlots lap. 47 No hand but serves Death's turn: Edric by's Mother; Alboin by's Wise; Aristo by his Friends; By's owne Son, Baiazeth, Conrad, by's Brother; Mustapha, by his Sire; Self, Cato ends. 48 Death diversly makes him familiar heer: Henry the Black, a bit of Bread could fine; A King of Goth's died, in a Tub of Beer; Thales, of Thirst; of Hunger, Antonine. 49 Death, every-where, in every thing distils Her fell Despite; Fire, Aier, Earth, Ocean: Drusus, a Peare; a Fig Terpander kils; A Fly (in drinking) choaketh Adrian. 50 As soon, a Soverain, as a Shepheard's gon: Men Dying heer have but one equall Quality: By Birth and Death is Their Condition one; Their Stay, and State, between, make th'Inequality. 51 There's no Death Sudden to the godly-Wise: His heart goes out to meet all haps before: When he embarks, he casts Wracks Ieopardies; And when Winde serves not, He will rowe no more. 52 Not knowing then, When, Where, thy Death will snatch; At Sea, or Land; Young, Old; Morn, Noon, or Night: Look for it ever, every-where keep watch. For, what we look-for, little can affright. 53 If Infants oft no sooner breathe then die; If Good-men little-last, and Wicked long: Be not too-curious in that Secret's Why? Th'are stroaks of that hand which strook never wrong. 54 Why Good men goe, and Why th'Vngodly stay, Dispute it not; God hath permitted so. Those die, to live: These live to die for aye: These, live at ease; Those in a World of Wo. 55 If from thy Dayes thou but thy Nights subtract; Thy Sleep's, thy Care's, thy Mawe's, thy Muse's waste, What thy Wife weareth, What thy Friends exact, Thy Griefs, thy Sutes: How short a Life thou hast! 56 The Head-ach, Tooth-ach, Gout, or Fever rife, Or Vlcer in the Leg, Stone, in the Reines, By lingring Drops strains out the tedious Life; Yet art thou loth that Death should rid thy Paines. 57 Thy Term expir'd, Thou put'st-off Payment yet, And weenst to win much by som Months delay. Sith pay thou must, wer't not as good be quit? For, Death will be no gentler any Day. 58 Th'affaires of Parting poast not to to-Morn, For, on Delay, Repentance waits with Woe: The Winde and Tide will in a Moment turn: All houres are good for Those resolv'd to goe. 59 Grudging to die in flower of thine age, Thou griev'st to be too-soon dicharg'd from Prison: Repin'st, too-soon t'have don thy Pilgrimage, Loth to have-in thy Harvest in due Season. 60 Make of thy Deeds, not of thy Dayes, account: Think not how far, but think how fair thou passest: See to what Summe thy Vertues will amount; For, Life and Gold are chose by waight; the massi'st. 61 Life's valued by th'effect, not by the age; The labour, not the lasting, praise it most: Long hath he liv'd that liveth to be sage; Good life (too-often) in long life is lost. 62 Long Acts commend not most a Comœdie, 'Tis still esteemed as the Parts are plaid: So, in our Lives, not Yeers considered be; But, worthy Actions by the Wise are waigh'd. 63 Who grieves because he liv'd not heer, yer born, A hundred yeers; is double worthy laughter: But, trebble He who at his Death doth mourn; Sure not to live a hundred yeers heer-after. 64 Man's not more Happy for long living heere. Number of Dayes doe not more Blisses bring: More Compass makes not a more complete Sphear. As round's a little, as a larger Ring. 65 And, if that Death wait on thee, and protract; With Vsurie, shee'll make thee pay it double: Thy Ioyes in Dream, thy Dolors still in act, To make long Life a long Repenting Trouble. 66 If Hee that heer thee in his Vineyard hir'd, Pay thee at Noon thy Wages, full as much As Those that there all the whole Day have tir'd; Why murmurst thou? why dost thou grieve and grutch? 67 He casts his Work well, well his Work-men kens; Thy Slackness, Slowness, Weakness to hold out: Therefore, yer weary, he thy Way-fare ends; Lest, staying longer, thou marre all, 'tis doubt. 68 He gives our Task, and he again will take it; Who Him, vnwilling; Him, vnworthy serves: Before he call, 'tis folly to forsake it; And who-so leaves it, to be left deserves. 69 Or first, or last, on All this Stamp is set; Early or late, into This Port must Wee: Who gave the Charge, ordained the Retrait; One self-same Law did Life and Death decree. 70 The more the Body dures, Soule more indures; Never too-soon can Shee from thence exile: Pure, in she came; there living, Shee impures; And suffers there a thousand Woes the while. 71 The Soule is forç't within the Flesh to dwell; In danger there she lives, and sleeps in fear: To hatch her Bird, she needs must break her Shell, And think It never can too-soon appear. 72 Soule blames the Body, Body blames the Soule; But, Death surprising, ends their Quarrell prest: Down goes the Body, in the Dust to roule; The faithfull Soule, vp to th'eternall Rest. 73 Death frees the Soule from Bodies wilfull Errors; From the Soules Vices, Shee the Bodie saves: The Soule's Annoyes, are to the Body Terrors; The Bodies Torments, to the Soule are Graves. 74 This Body is not Man: His Stuff's more fine; His Beauty, with Heav'ns Beauty hath Affinitie: The Body dead, That ever-lives, divine; As even a Beam from the supream Divinitie. 75 If then the Soule, so long Heer languishing Within the Bodie, doe not gladly part; She hath forgotten her owne Source or Spring, And that Shee must, from whence she came, revert. 76 But, more then Death, Death's Pain appalleth thee; That's but a Stream which swiftly vanisheth: There's, as no Pain, in that Extreamitie: For, th'Body, down, doth nothing feele in death. 77 Then quit those Fears that in thy Phantsie stick: For, violent Evils have no permanence: If that Death's Pain be keen, 'tis also quick; And by the Quickness takes away the Sense. 78 To leave thy Babes behinde, thy heart it gripes; In Whose, Thou shalt reviue, from lap to lap: Happy who hath them; for they are our Types: And oft Who hath None, 's happy by mishap. 79 To leave thy Wife thou wail'st, well worth excusing; 'T's necessary Ill, Good stranger-like; Which, cleerest Eyes (Selfe-wise) too-oft mischusing, In little Flesh finde many Bones to pick. 80 Th'art loth to leave the Cour'ts Delights, Devices, Where None lives long vnbrav'd, or vnabhorred: Where Treason's Prudence; where the Vertues Vices: Where som no Eyes, and where som have no Forehead. 81 The Mariner, that runs from Rock to Rock, From Wrack to Wrack, dwelling in dangers rife, Wave's Bal, Wind's Thral, and Tempest's Shuttlecock, Would not exchange His for the Courtiers Life. 82 The Court beguiles thee, as black-Angel-Bands, In giving Leaves for Fruits to Circes Sisters: Their brightest Torches are but funerall Brands: And, in the Court, All is not Gold that glisters. 83 Thou would'st in Death revenge thy wronged Worth, Make known thy Love, haue shown thy brave Ambition: Why fram'st thou not thy Death vnto thy Birth, Which brought thee naked forth, and voyd of Passion? 84 Fain would'st thou see thy Learning's fruit (perhaps) Ripe, yer Thou rot; that's but a vain Desire: Art now-adayes may starve, while Ignorance Hath Shades for Summer; and for Winter, Fire. 85 All day thou trudgest thorough thick and thin, For that dull Bulk which doth thee daily brave: Phinice wreaths Ropes, which aye his Ass winds-in: The Soule that serves the Body, is a Slave. 86 As many steps in Death as Life we tread: Esteem, for Deaths, all Daies since thou hadst breath: To come's not Thine; Present, is instant fled: And Time, in time, is over-comn by Death. 87 When Man's imbarkt on th'Vniversall Deck, He neither swiften can his Course, nor slack it: Tide, Winde, and Weather, are not at his Beck; And, To put back, hath many often wracked. 88 Som, somtimes grieve for one that gladly dies: Socrates ioyes, sith wrong he suffereth: Xantippa melts in Tears; He laughs, Shee cries: Diversly iudging of these Darts of Death. 89 To run vnto this Death, is Desperate rage: Wise Patience only waits it every-where: Who scorns it, showes a Resolution sage: For, Cowards flie it, and the Idiots feare. 90 When the last Sand of our last Glass goes out, Without recoyling, we must step our last: As, without grudge or noise, dislodge the Stout; And when they must goe, stay not to be chaç't. 91 The Pilgrim longs to have his Iourney don; The Mariner would fain be off the Seas: The Work-man ioyes to end his Work begun; And yet Man mournes to finish his Disease. 92 For a short time Thy Sun is over-cast: But, Thou shalt once re-see 't more bright than ever: And, that same Day, which heer thou think'st thy last, Is a New-birth Day, to be ended never. 93 What Wrong doth Death, I pree-thee Worldling say, When, losing (vnder hope of happier matches) Curting thy Life, he takes thy Card away; And when, to save thy Life, thy Light he snatches? 94 Fear'st thou, Faint-heart, that narrow Plank to pass Which God Himselfe hath gon; which all Men must? That, like a Childe, held by the sleeve (alas!) With Eye still glancing on the brim thou go'st? 95 Beyond it, thou shalt see those pleasant Plains, Whose boundless Beauty all Discourse transcendeth: Where Kings and Subiects soules, have fellow Raigns, On blessed Thrones, whose Glory never endeth. 96 What shalt thou see more, for more living Heer? This Heaven, this Sun, thou oft before hast seen: And shouldst thou live another Plato's Yeer, This World would be the same that it hath been. 97 Death's end of Ills, and only Sanctuary Of him that cannot scape the Grudge, the Gall Of a severe Iudge and proud Adversary: It is a Point which Heav'n appoints to All. 98 At that Divorce sigh Bodies, Soules do solace: Th'Exile exulteth at his Home-Retrait: This Bodie's but the Inne, 'tis not the Palace: Th'immortall Soule, hath an immortall Seat. 99 Death's as the Dawning of that happy Day, Where without Setting shines the Eternall Sun, Where-in who walk, can never never stray: Nor Fear they Night who to the Day-ward run. 100 There's Rest eternall for thy Labours rife: There's for thy Bondage bound-less Liberty: There when Death endeth, she begins thy Life. And where's no more Time, there's Eternity. FINIS. MEMORIALS OF MORTALITIE. Written in Tablets, or Quatrains, By Piere Mathiev. The Second Centurie.

MEMORIALS OF MORTALITIE. 1 That height of Kings, Crowns Honour, Worthies wonder, Is now but winde, dust, shade. Hee, whose Approach Appall'd the Proudest, Whom All trembled vnder, A cursed base hand butcherd in his Coach. 2 All Triumph, yesterday; to-day, all Terror: Nay; the fair Morning over-cast yer Even: Nay; one short Hour saw, live and dead, Wars Mirror, Having Death's speed-stroak vndiscerned given. 3 In all This World, All's fickle; nought is firm: It is a Sea, sanz Safety, Calm, or Port: Lawes, Cities, Empires, have but heer their Term: Whatever's born must vnder death resort. 4 Time flits as Winde, and as a Torrent swifteth: It passeth quick, and Nought can stop it flying: Who knowes what Ills it every Moment drifteth, Deems, that To leave to live, is To leave dying. 5 Man in the Womb knowes nothing of his State: (A wile of Nature) for, there, had hee Reason, Hee should foreknowe this Worlds too-wretched Fate; And rather would intomb him in that Prison. 6 Our Birth begins our Beer; our Death, our Breath: On that Condition Heer aboord wee com: To bee's as not to bee: Birth is but Death: Ther's but a Sigh from Table to the Tomb. 7 Life's but a Flash, a Fume, a Froath, a Fable, A Puffe, a Picture in the Water seeming; A waking Dream, Dreams Shadow, Shadowes Table, Troubling the Brain with idle Vapours steeming. 8 Life, to the life, The Chess-boord lineats; Where Pawnes and Kings have equall Portion: This leaps, that limps, this checks, that necks, that mates: Their Names are diverse; but their Wood is one. 9 Death, Exile, Sorrow, Fear, Distraction, Strife, And all those Evils, seen before suspected; Are not the Pains, but Tributes of this Life; Whence, Kings no more than Carters are protected. 10 No: Sacraments have been no Sanctuarie From Death; Nor Altars, for Kings offring-vp: Th'Hell hallowd Host poysons Imperiall Harry: Pope Victor dies drinking th'immortall Cup. 11 Thou ow'st thy Soule to Heav'n: to pay that Debt Be not compell'd; Christians are willing Payers: But, yet, thy Soule as a Good Guest intreat; Whom no good Hoste will tumble down the Stairs. 12 'Tis better fall, then still to fear a fall: 'Tis better die, then to be still a-dying: The End of Pain ends the Complaint withall: And nothing grieves that comes but once, and flying. 13 This Life's a Web, woven fine for som, som gross; Som Hemp, som Flax, som longer, shorter som: Good and Ill Haps are but the Threeds across: And first or last, Death cuts it from the Loom. 14 These Names, which make som blubber, som so brave (Names sprung from Iniury, or from Ambition) In Death are equall: Earle, and Sir, and Slave, Vnder his Empire, are in one Condition. 15 For Friends Deceast, cease not repast nor Sleep; Such Sorrow sutes not th'Intellectuall part: Who wailes mans Death, that he was man doth weep: And, that He promist, comming to depart. 16 The Young and old goe not as equall pas't: Th'one ambles swift, the other gallopeth: Tis good to die, yer we our Life distaste. A valiant Man should dare to feel his Death. 17 Happy who leave the World when first they come; Th'Aire, at the best, is heer contagious thick: Happy that Childe, who issuing from the Wombe Of's Spanish Mother, there returned quick, 18 The Bodie's Torments are but Twigs to beat And brush the Dust from Vertues pleights about; And make the Passions of the Soule more neat: As th'Aier is purest when the windes roar-out. 19 Grieving that Death shuts not thine Eyes at home, And where the Heav'ns vouchsaf't them first to ope; Thou sear'st the Earth too little for thy Tombe, And Heav'n too-narrow so thy Corpses Cope. 20 Heav'ns no less Order have, then at their Birth, Nor Influence: Sun, Moon, and Stars, as bright; All hold their owne; Fire, Water, Aier, and Earth: Man, Man alone's fall'n from his pristine Plight. 21 Worldling, thou saist, 'Tis yet not time to mend; But, God hates Sinners that in Sin delight: To grossest Sinners doth he Mercy send; But, not to Sinners sinning in despight. 22 Who, Morn and Even, doth of Himselfe demand Account of All that he hath done, said, thought; Shall finde him much eas'd, when he comes to stand To that Account where all shall once be brought. 23 For bitter Checks that make thy, Cheeks to flame, And to thy Teeth tell Truths, thou hast no Action: To doe the Evill, sith thou hadst no shame, Be not asham'd to suffer thy Correction. 24 Perhaps, this Childe, shall Rich, or Poor, become: Perhaps a Wretch, perhaps a Liberall: Perhaps a Wise-man, and perhaps a Mome: But, past perhaps, assured, die he shall. 25 When Wine runs lowe, it is not worth the sparing? The worst and least doth to the Bottom dive: Wrong not thy leisure (yeers vouchsafe) in daring: But som-times look into thy Grave, alive. 26 Sinner, thy God is not inexorable; No Radamanth, Returning hearts to hate: There is no Sin, in Heav'n vnpardonable; Nor no Repentance in this Life, too late. 27 The Eye that fixly the Sun-beames beholds, Is sudden daz'd: So, in God's Iudgements high, Mens cleerest Iudgements are as blind as Moules: None, none but Eagles, can the Lightning eye. 28 O wretched Vertue! wretched is Thy state; For, fortune hath the Fruit, Thou scarce the Flower: Thou art a Stranger at thy proper Gate, Thy Friends thence banisht, and thy Foes in Bower. 29 Man, Knowledge still, to the last gaspe, affecteth; In learning, Socrates, lives, grayes, and dyes. Free from Death's Process Knowledge none protecteth: But, to learn Well to die, is to be Wise. 30 To live, is to begin One-work, and end it: Life hath, with All, not same Repute, Report; 'T's an Exile, to the Sot; Sage, Iourney ween'd it: Wherein He walkes, not as the Common-sort. 31 For having a good Prince, Peers iust and wise, Obedient People, Peace concluded fast, A State's not sure: Storms after Calms arise; And fairest Dayes have foulest over-cast. 32 Man, though thou be from Heav'n Originary, Presume not yet to Peer thee with thy God: Hee's Soverain King; Thou but his Tributary. Hee's every where; Thou but in one poor Clod. 33 Of Elephants, the biggest leads the Band; The strongest Bull over the Heard doth raign: But, Him behooves who will Mankind command, Not ablest Body, but the aptest Brain. 34 Kings Maiesty seems as eclipsed much, Vnless great Servants in great Troops attend: 'Tis sure an Honour to be serv'd by Such; But, on Their Faith 'tis fearfull to depend. 35 To build a Palace, rarest Stones are sought: To build a Ship, best Timber is selected: But, to instruct young Princes (as they ought) Ought all the Vertues to be there collected. 36 Art's now-adayes a Desert desolate: Kings gracious Raies are there no more discerned: Philosophers wait at the Wealthies Gate, And rarely Rich men do regard the Learned. 37 Th'hand bindeth not except the heart with-go: What comes not thence, nor Thank, nor Thought deserves. He giveth All that doth Himselfe bestow; He Nothing gives who but his heart reserves. 38 That curious Thirst of Travaile to and fro, Yeelds not the Fruit it promis'd men in minde: Changing their Aire, their humors change not tho; But, many Lodgings, and few Friends they finde. 39 In vain the Soule hath Reason's Attribute, Which vnto Reason cannot Sense submit: For, Man (alas!) is bruter then a Brute, Vnless that Reason bridle Appetite. 40 Self-swelling Knowledge, Wits owne Overbearer, Proves Ignorance, and findes it Nothing knowes: It flies the Truth to follow Lyes and Error: And, when most right it weens, most wry it goes. 41 The Vicious trembles, alwaies in Alarms; Th'Eye of the Vertuous keeps him as at Bay: When All the World fear'd Rome's All-reaching Arms, One vertuous Cato did all Rome dismay. 42 Vice blinds the Soule, and Vnderstanding clogs, Makes good of ill, takes foule for fairest look, Yea, Durt for Dainties: so live loathsom Frogs, Rather in Puddles than in purest Brook. 43 In Greatest Houses Vice hath battered, Whose Honors though no less have shined bright: What are the Graceless to the Good? Not dead, But living Branches, in the Tree have Right. 44 If Men might freely take Essay of Court; None, having tasted, would return so neer: The happiest there meets many a Spight in Sport, And knows too-well he buyes his Weal too-deer. 45 To love None, All to doubt; to fain, to flatter; To form new Faces, and transform true harts; To offer Service, and flie-off in Matter; Are Courtiers Lessons, and their Ground of Arts. 46 Set not thy Rest on Court, Seas barren sand; There grows no Goodness; good, there, evill growes: Rest's Temple yerst did forth the Citie stand: No Sent's so sweet, as is the Country Rose. 47 Who weens in Court to thrive, will find him weak, Without two Aiders; Impudence, Immunitie: For, first behooves him his owne Brows to break, Yer Others heads he break with Importunitie. 48 Who is not sory for Time's loss, in stay For Kings slowe Favours, seems to have no sense: The loss of Goods a Prince may well repay, But loss of Time Kings cannot recompence. 49 Is't not the Top of Follies Top, to note An Old Sir Tame-ass gallanting in Court, To play the Yonker, and Swan-white to dote On Venus Dovelings, in despite of Sport? 50 A mean Man hardly scapes the Mightie's Clawes; Hee's as a Mouse play'ng by a sleeping Cat; Who lets it run, then locks it in her Pawes: And all her sports boad but the Death of That. 51 Worlds Vanitie is rife in every place, (Alas! that good Wits should be 'witched so!) Maskt in the Church, in Court with open Face. For there's the place her perfectly to know. 52 By evill Manners is good Nature marred; None fals at once, all Vertue to defie. Vice, in the Soule is a strange Plant transferred: And wer't not dressed, it would quickly die. 53 With By-Respects Impietie we cover: Earth more then Heav'ns is priz'd among vs Now: At God's great Name we scarce our heads vncover; When Kings are named, every knee doth bow. 54 Disorder Order breeds: good Lawes have sprung From Evill lives: Would All keep Iustice line, In Westminster there would be soon less Throng, Less Work, less Wrack, less Words for Mine and Thine. 55 Law-tricks now strip the People to their shirt: Shift is their Shield, Gold is their only God: Wasps break the Web, Flies are held fast and hurt: The Guilty quit, the Guiltless vnder-trod. 56 Ther's now no trust: Brother betraies his Brother: Faith's but a phantsie, but by Fools esteemd: Friend's false to Friend; and All deceive each-other; Th'Ivie puls down the Wall by which it climbd. 57 Treasons be Trifles: Man's a Wolfe to Man: Crimes be but Crums; Vice is for Vertue vanted; Sodom's and Cypris Sinnes we suffer can: And Impious tricks in all their Tracks are hanted. 58 In perfect'st Men som Imperfection's found, Som-what amiss among their good is seen: Gold, and pure Gold we dig not from the ground; There's Dust and Dross, and grosser stuffe between. 59 Merit, of old did Friendship feed and fix; Where now-adayes 'tis founded all on Profit, With deep Dissembling and Deceitfull-tricks, And evermore the Poor is frustrate of it. 60 Th'Earth cannot fill thy hearts vnequall Angles, Thy Heart's a Triangle, the Earth's a Round: A Triangle is fill'd but with Triangles: And th'infinite the finite cannot bound. 61 'T's a Death to die far from ones Native Citie: Yet Death's not milder there, then else-about: Death, without Rome, did not Rutilius pitie; Neither, within Rome, Him that ne'r went out. 62 When Man is com'n to th'old last Cast of Age, When Nature can no longer lend nor borrow; He thinks not yet to pack, and leave the Stage; But still, still hopes to live vntill to-Morrow. 63 Fain, would'st thou flie Loue's wanton Luxury? Cut off Occasions: speake far-off; fly Fitness: Shun Solitude: live still in Company: They fall alone that would not fall with witness. 64 Muse not, to see the Wicked prosper faire: The Sun his Shine even vnto Theeves doth give: When of their Patients Leaches do despaire, They give them over as they list to live. 65 Slander is worser than Hell's burning Torture, The force more fierce, the Heat more vehement: Hell, after Death, doth but the Guilty martyr; Slander, alive, torments the Innocent. 66 Affliction razes, and then raises hearts: As, vnder Waight, victorious Palms are wont: As, vnder Seales the Wax doth swell (in part); Vnder the Cross the Soule to Heav'n doth mount. 67 Envie, in vain pure Vertues Anvill bites, Breaking her Teeth: as on a Stone the Cur, That barks of Custom, rather then Despight, At every poore and harmless Passenger. 68 Envie's a Torture which doth Men molest; Even from their Birth; yet they ought else can doo: Behold Two Infants nursed at one Brest; They cannot brook their Teat for meat to Two. 69 This is the Ods twixt Honest men and Knaves; Th'one tels his Neighbour, All mine owne is mine, And all Thine too: The other (void of Braves) Saith, Thine's not Mine; but what I have is Thine. 70 What Envy likes not, that she makes a Fault: Ioseph with Ismael, for his Dream, was barter'd: Abels pure Offring to his End him brought: And for the Truth the Innocent are martyrd. 71 Flat-Cap, for whom, hoord'st thou thy heaped Treasures? Thy Bodies Sweat, thy Soule's deer Price (poor Sot!)? Sir Prodige-all (thine Heire) in Protean Pleasures, Will waste, in one Day, All thine Age hath got. 72 True Liberality would be intire: Yet not at-once, at all times, and to all. One may mis-give, to give yer one require: Yet Gifts vn-asked sweetest Gifts I call. 73 Content with Fruits from thine owne Labour grow'n, A fore-hand still, a set Revenew save: For, Hee's a Foole in more respects than one, That spends his Store, or more, before he have. 74 There is no Goodness in a groveling heart, Bent on the World, bound to this Rock belowe: Were not the Moon so neer this Neather part, Shee would not, could not, be Eclipsed so. 75 Goods are great Ills to those that cannot vse them: Misers mis-keep, and Prodigals mis-spend-them: Hell-hounds, to hasten toward Hell, abuse-them: As Wings, to Heav'n-ward, heav'n-bent-Souls extend them. 76 Presumptuous Spirits spring not from right Nobility: Courage, that comes from Pride proves never true: Pride ruines hearts whose Raiser is Humility: The humble Shepheard the proud Giant slew. 77 Pride glitters oft vnder an humble Weed: Oft lovely Names are given to loath'd Effects; Men sooth them in the Cause, to 'scuse th'ill Deed: And blame Light, rather than their Sight's Defect. 78 A Prudent man is, for Him-self, sought-forth: Hee's more admir'd then what the World most vants: Praises are due vnto ones proper Worth: Not purest Gold addes Price to Diamants. 79 Th'Humble, doth Others prize; Him-selfe depress: Saue against Pride he never bends his Browes: The more his Vertue mounts-him, counts-him less: God th'humble Sinner, not proud Iust, allowes. 80 O! Hypocrite, which hast but Vertue's Vaile, Seem what thou art, and what thou seemest be: To hide thy Filth, all thy Fig-leaves will faile: Thou canst not hide thee from thy God, nor Thee. 81 Mock-Saints, whose Soule-weal on your Works you lay, With eyes and hands to Heaven, while heart's else-where: For shame you durst not to the least man say, What you (profane) dare whisper in Gods eare. 82 Gold's fin'd in fire: Soules in Affliction, better: Moths gnaw the Garment locked in the Chest: Still water stinks, vnwholesom, black, and bitter: Swords rust in Sheathes, and so doe Soules in Rest. 83 Opening thy Soule to God, close Mouth from Men: Nor let thy Thoughts roame from thy due Intent; God sees the hearts, his iudgement soundeth them, And Them confounds whose Words and Deeds dissent. 84 Gamesters may well All to to-Morrow post; To see, or to be seen, th'have never leasure: With adverse Windes their Mindes are ever tost; Loss bringing Grief, more than the Gain brings Pleasure. 85 To shun Affaires, behoves exceeding heed: Troubles vnsent-for, and vnlookt-for, haste; Vn-set, vn-sowen, too-early growes the Weed: We meet too-soon the Care we hoped past. 86 All Idleness, dis-natures Wit, dis-nerves-it; A mod'rate Travell makes it quick, addrest: Sloath quels and kils it; Exercise preserves-it: But, Hee's not Free hat hath no time to rest. 87 Who seeketh Rest in troublous Managings, Thinks to find Calm amid Tempestuous Seas: The World and Rest are Two, two adverse things: Thick streams re-cleer when storms and stirrings cease. 88 Fortune in Court is fickle, apt to vary: Favours sort seldom to the Suiters minde: They many times even in the Port mis-cary: The hotter Sun, the blacker shade they finde. 89 Gifts, Honours, Office, Greatnes, Grace of Kings, Are but the Vshers of Adversity: For their last mischief, have the Emmets wings: And height of Health betokens Sicknes ny. 90 Youth hath more Lures, more Traps, more Trains to Ill, Then Fouler Gins, or Baits the Fisher-man: Age would, but cannot what it would, fulfill: Senex, thou leau'st not Sin: Sin leaues Thee, than. 91 Th'Eye tends to Bewty, as the Centre of-it: After the Eyes, Heart and Affections drawe: 'Tis hard to keep safe what so-many covet: For, mens Desires Kings cannot keep in Awe. 92 All Good or Ill-hap, that heer happens thee, Coms from Opinion (which All-ruling seems). Opinion makes vs Other then wee bee: Hee's not vnhappy, who him happy deems. 93 From contrary Effects is formed Sadnes: Both Smoak and Smiles have made the Eyes to water. Who sowe in Tears, shall one day reap in Gladnes: Who sowe in Ioies, shall reap Annoyes heerafter. 94 Let's leave out I, and No, in Conversation: Words now transposed, and wax-nosed, Both, By Romes New Doctrine of Equivocation, Which gives a Ly the Credit of an Oath. 95 Friends, now-adaies, wake at the noise of Gain. As Bees to Flowrs, as Crowes to Carion haste, As Flies to Flesh, as Birds and Ants to Grain: So Friends to Profit thickly flock and fast. 96 Who reaves thine Honour, scoffs, if hee presume T'have don thee favour, that thy life hee left: Why should the Bird live, having lost her Plume? The rest is nothing when the Honour's reft. 97 Little sufficeth Life, in th'vn-delicious; The Sun for need may somtimes dress our Victuall: I blame, alike, the Cynik and Apicius; This, for his too-too-much; That's, too-too-little. 98 Too-oft is made too-ill Interpretation Of Words and Deeds best meant and built on Reason: All's evill to the Evill, by Self-flation: Whenee Bees their Hony, Spiders suck their Poyson. 99 Happy the People where Iust-Gentle Prince-is: Whose Sword is Iustice, and whose Shield is Love. For These, Augustus Deified long-since-is: And without These, Kings Scepters maimed prove. 100 Good-hap, Good-heart, Favour, and Labour met, Bring Men to Riches and to Honors heer; But that's the Way about: To be born Great, Is great Advantage; Not to buy so deer. FINIS. S?. LEWIS; THE KING: OR A LAMP OF GRACE, lighting the Great (in the right way) TO GLORY Translated; and Dedicated To My gracious Lord, Prince Charles. Not that your Highnes needs My mean Direction (Having, within, a Princely spirit for Guide; Without, your Parent; round about, beside, Precepts and Patterns of divine Perfection) Presume I Thus to bring (in dim Reflexion) This forrain Lamp (admired far and wide): But, as An humble Gift This New-Yeers-Tide, To intimate my Faith, and my Affection. Your gracious hand Thus bindes my gratefull heart To Offer Heav'n my Vows; and You, my Verse, For that Deliverance You have daign'd, in part, To my poor Hopes, wrackt in your Brothers Herse. You have begun: Vouchsafe mee, Sacred Powrs, You may go-on, and make Mee wholly Yours In Effect, as In Affection To Your Highnes Service humbly devoted, Iosvah Sylvester. AD EVNDEM PRINCIPEM Opt.

Of all the Kings, admired over All, Whose Prudence swaid This Crown Imperiall, Whose Prowess most our Lillies Bounds inlarg'd, Whose Iustice best their Charge in Peace discharg'd, Whom most the Raies of glorious Greatnes crownd, Who brightest shin'd, Who was the most Renownd, Most magnified for Manly Conquering Within the World the World: was th'Holy King, From whose chast loins, from out whose loyall Bloud Th'Heroick Stems of Royall Bovrbons bud; Famous S?. Levvis; Good Kings President, Who for his Christ, and for his Cross, him spent: Who by his Valour so renown'd his Name, That all the Earth hath trembled at the same: And Who, to free, from captive Fury fell, The Fields where yerst Our Captain conquer'd Hell (Courageous Zeal setting his Soule on fire) Led armed France against the Asians ire. When I his Vertues read, and Acts so great, Which Him so high among the Saints have set; And heer belowe so lasting glory wan, I judge them scarce Works of a meerly Man; But, of an Angell in Mans shape bedight, To shew the World the Way of Vertue right; Amaz'd to see, among so many Sins As (fatally) the Court breeds and begins, Among so many Pleasures, whose sweet Baits Intrap the wariest with their wily Sleights; A King to curb him so in Powr supream, To watch him Self so with such care extream, As not to taste Delight (of any kinde) Which Reason bars a brave and noble Minde: But, so vpright in Vertve's track to tread, That even in Earth a Heav'nly Life hee led. For, never was there more accomplisht King, Whose royall heart had more replenishing Of Princely Vertues, fit for Powerfull hand; Or to bee wisht in Mindes of High Command. Nay; would the Heav'ns, their Treasures all producing, All Gifts of Body and of Minde conducing, Mould for Mankinde a Prince or Potentate Worthy to govern th'Vniversal State; They could not give the World (and Wee, much less, Wish) One more worthy; with more due Address To take into his Royall hand the Helm, In stormfull Times so apt to over-whelm. So much the Star, which rules in Birth of Kings, When Hee was destin'd to These Managings, Milde and propitious, in His heart connext, First, fear of God, and love of Ivstice next: Vertves, whose habit Happinesse doth nourish: Makes Common-wealth flowe, and The Church to flourish: Serves best for Base to each illustrious State: Gives mightiest Kings calm Crowns, and fortunate: Causeth their Subjects fear them lovingly: Keeps Them, in Dangers, ever danger-free. For, the Almighty printing in their Face Milde-Maiesty, sweet-Terror, dreadfull-Grace, And heaping Hap vpon them every-where; The Good fear for them; Them, the Evill fear. How many brave Marks left his noble Minde Of th'Happiness These Vertues bring Mankinde; When, full of Constancy, hee durst maintain, That, raigning for Him, Who made him to raign, These sacred Twins, nigh from the World dis-pell'd, As in their Temple, in His Bosom dwell'd, Guided his Person, govern'd his Affairs, Counsell'd his Counsells, qualifi'd his Cares, Steerd all his Course through all his Voiage heer, As men their Ships by Card and Compass steer. These making him with rarest spirits compeer, In holy pride, Hee even despised heer The Kings, that, puft with glory of a Throne, Commanded All, except themselves alone. By th'one, hee happied his owne Soule with Rest: By th'other also, hee his People blest. By th'one, becomming to him Self severe, Hee rul'd him Self, kept his owne Power in fear: By th'other, giving free Course to the Law, Hee kept his Subjects in; and, happy, saw Through all his Kingdom Peace and Plenty flowr In basest Grange, as well as golden Bowr. But twelve times Sol through the twelve Signes had gon, When Heav'ns assign'd him to his Fathers Throne; And to the hands of his Man-Childehood left The glorious Burthen of This Sceptres heft: But, as in th'Orchards at Monceaux or Blois, The Gardners Care over som Graftlings choise, The second year of their adoption there, Makes them as good and goodly fruits to bear, As Trees whose Trunk and branched Top bewraies Their Months as many as the Other's daies; Through the Heav'ns favour, and Earths fruitfulness, Shewing that God their young first-fruits doth bless: His forward Vertue in his Pupillage Brought forth th'effects of a mans perfect age; Disproving quite his feeble signes of youth, And proving him invincible (in truth) Against vain Pleasures, all their Baits condemning: Against all Perils, Death it Self contemning: Against all Passions, ever them resisting: Against all Crosses, constant ay persisting. For, look how lowe, his heart in humble Aw Hee bow'd to God, and bended to the Law; As high hee mounts it, in Praise-worthy Pride, Above the World, Fortune, and All (beside) Whose Vanity, with false gloss gilded o'r, Fond Mortals most desire, admire, adore: Desiring, onely, with that holy Mary (For his degree) That One thing necessary: Admiring solely th'holy Works, wherein Th'Almighty Worker's wondrous hand is seen: Adoring none but th'Everlasting One; Him loving best; fearing but Him alone. Then, bearing ay This Oracle imprest Within the Centre of his royall brest, That, A sincere and true-Religious King, Feared of All, needs fear at all no-Thing; Where Hee, whose Soule hath not This Fear in-laid, Of none is feared, but of All affraid. Arm'd with This Brest-plate, as with stronger Arms Then Those (of old) blest with inchanting Charms, Hee brav'd all Perills that his Prowess met: And His calm Spirit, amid a Storm so great As would have cast Youth in a swoun insensible, Shew'd Resolution of a heart invincible; Appearing such, indeed, as Painters fain Great Hercules, when, Iuno's fell disdain Pursuing him, hee Monsters quail'd and kill'd; A Man in Courage, though in Age a Childe. Which well hee proov'd to those Rebellious Peers, Who, making light of his then-tender yeers, And measuring his in-side by his age, Troubled his State with storms of Civill Rage: Armed against him many a Tower and Town, Aimed by Ambush to surprise his Crown. When Hee, to heal, by necessary Ill, This Ill, before th'Impostume over-fill, With Sword in hand their first Assault prevents; And, as His Subjects, bravely them convents, To come and cast them arm-less at his feet; Or else, as Foes, his armed Force to meet: From Him, their true Liege (if true French they bee) Arm'd in the Field, to take This Offer free, Revenge, or Pardon, of their past Mis-deeds, And all the Mischief which the same succeeds. The one, his Power should press them to, perforce; Th'other, their Duties, vrged with Remorse: If their blinde Fury did the one contemn, Th'other should pour Death and Disgrace on them. O! how the words of a brave Prince prevail! This daring Speech did so their Courage quail, That though the cold Ice of a prudent Fear Did not forth-with put-out their frenzy there; Yet did it daily from thence-forth decline, And all their Flame turn'd but to Fume, in fine. Yea, Those, whose fury dream't a Diadem, Their Side abandon; and, dis-banding them, Reject their vain Hopes; and, in season, fly To the Kings Mercy for their Remedy. Others, more dreading Rigor of the Law, Vnder protection of the English draw: Guilding their Guilt with frivolous pretences, Arming their weak Cause with as weak defences; Till, but increasing their dis-honour by't, Wanting as well good Fortune as good Right, They'r also fain to beg his Bounty royall, Ill worthy Them, so obstinate-Disloyall. What proofs of Prowess, what contempt of danger, Exprest this Prince vpon the envious Stranger, On crystall Charant, in Zantognian Coast, When false la-March, backt with a forrain Host, Mustred against him, from so many parts, So many Groves of Lances, Pikes and Darts? There France and England, fully bent to fight, Had both their Armies in their Order pight; From Either side mount winged Clouds amain; On Either side they pour their Showrs again: While silver Charant, to have barr'd their Teen, Her swelling shoulders did oppose between. This River makes the Reed-crownd Banks to kiss, By th'arched favour of a Bridge there is: Whose gain or loss (besides the honour) boads, Or bars, the Prize of Victory, by ods: The English, friended by a Fort at hand, Which proudly did the neighbour Plains command, Had won this Passage, and were passing on Cheerly to end their Victory begun: When Lewis, rushing to the Bridge, the first, Repels the Fo, and puts him to the worst; With Dead and Wounded all the place hee paves, And, than Horatius, braver him behaves: Re-heartens His: re-haleth from the Fo Fair Victory, ready with Them to go: Standing alone, as a firm rock, afront, Almost alone, to bear the Battells brunt; As th'onely mark of many thousand Darts At Him alone still aimed from all parts: Till at the last, by his example prest, Hee winning all, his Army won the rest; When, if his Courage shin'd in Conquering, More did his Mildeness in the Managing. Who can recount, and yet who would conceal, Th'illustrious Vertues, whose industrious zeal O'r all the World his honours blazed yerst, After these mists, these first clouds, were disperst, And scatter'd all by the bright-shining Raies Of this new Sun, in Summer of his daies, When (Europe's Vmpire) making Peace with Men, Hee War proclaim'd against their Vices then? The glorious VVorks his Royall Vertues did, Cannot, without impiety, be hid; Although, without diminishing their Worth, My Muse (alas!) can neuer set them forth: For, of all Vertues sacred Tracts (least rife) His Life's a Picture, limned to the life, And such a Pattern, as to match again, The VVish is vertuous, but the Hope is vain: Sith, the more wondrous 'tis, and VVorthy Table To imitate, 'tis more inimitable. So that, His Worth, weening to-life to limne, I ouer-reach, in stead of reaching Him: And, like bad Singers (as too-bold, too-blame) Sounding His Praise, rather My Selfe I shame. In heav'nly Annals are his Acts inrold: His Royall Gests are yet in Asia told: In Affrike, yet his Valour is renownd: Through Europe euer shall his Uertues sound; And every-where Ninth Levvis (Great in Fame) Seems, not a Man's, but very Vertve's Name. Never did Faith, Honour, Vprightnes, raign, With Constancy, in Soule of Soverain More pious-given, more fearing-God, more Foe To Idol-Rites (Religion's overthrowe); Nor more desirous Vertue to prefer, To propagate Christ's Kingdom every-where; To root-out Vice, to raze Idolatry, And raise the Tropheis of Trvth's Victory. Burning with this Desire (his best Delight) In Affrick, twice, Hee Crossed Standards pight, Expos'd his Life vnto the chance of War; By Sea and Land adventur'd oft, and far: Where, seeking Death, at last, Hee Durance fand Within a faith-less, love-less, law-less, Land; Where Hee, as Gain, and as to raign, did take, To serve and suffer for his Saviours sake. But, all the Battells, won and lost, to sing, Abroad atchieved by this Valiant King: The Sack of Damiete, and the bloody Spoil Of Sarazens, both on the Shores of Nile, And of the Sea, thrice strewed (as it were) With Carcases of Pagans slaughtred there: The Siege of Cairo, when brave Victory Mourn'd all in Black for His Captivity: The sacred Terror and Majestike Grace, Which (from above) shin'd in his Eies and Face, When two Turk-Traitors (with their swords, in grain Dy'd with the blood of their late Souldan slain) Comming to kill him, felt, with strange remorse, Their fury feebled by a secret force; From murderous fists letting their weapons fall When they beheld his face majesticall. His Lybian journey, when to Carthage tho This Champion seem'd another Scipio: Th'honour hee won at Tunis, where hee crownd His Life and Fortunes, evermore renown'd. In brief, to vndertake to tell at large All his Exploits, were a more waighty Charge Then can the powres of my weak Soul support: And such a Web to weave in worthy sort, Behoves the hand of a more happy Wit, Both warp and woof with golden Threds to fit. I therefore, quitting th'hopefull Arrogance Sprung from ignoring of our Ignorance, Shall think My Labour crown'd sufficient, If this my speaking Pencil, Phœbus lent To colour Verses, can but duly lim Least-glittering Raies that shin'd with Praise in Him. Leaving therefore His Wars discourse to Those Whose buskind Muse Bellona's march out-goes, Whose Numbers thunder, and whose stile distills Fresh Drops of Death from their Heroick Quills, In lofty strains, as gravely, bravely-bold: I'll lowely sound his Laurels less extold, Which Hee (at Peace) won in his War with Vices, And happy Toil in holy Exercises. For, as I cannot His high Prowes express; Much-less can I with silent Slothfulness, Vnder Oblivion's rusty keies conceal The wondrous Care, the right religious Zeal, Which from his Youth ay in his heart had burn'd, To see The seen House of the Lord adorn'd: For, in this Vertue, none hath neer Him com Of all the Kings have raign'd in Christendom. Not, for, Wee owe to Him the Monuments Which with his blood Our Saviour's Patience Bath'd in his Passion, and whose Sight, as yet, Shakes godly Soules in glad-sad sacred Fit: But, for (abhorring Shepheards bad and blinde) A studious Care boild in his zealous Minde, Yea, burn'd his Soules soule with a hot desire, That, in the Church-Ship, none to Charge aspire, But, skilfull, faithfull, carefull, Mariners, Able and apt for all Affairs of Hers; Whose holy Labours, in courageous sort, Maugre all Storms, may steer into the Port. Deuoured of this Zeal, and dreading ay Lest Hee be charged at the later Day By th'onely Iudge, with Vice and Ignorance Of those Hee chose, through all the folds of France, To Feed the Flocks vnder his Power alli'd: When's royall office bound him to provide, With wondrous Care did hee their lives explore, Who-ever had commended them before: And never gave hee the supream Degrees, Th'Ecclesiastick sacred Dignities, But vnto Those whose Life and Learning too Were Eminent, both to direct and doo; To feed, as Shepheards; as a Watch, to ward; To heal the Sick, Sound from the Wolf to guard; And, carefull Stewards, in due time to break The Bread of Life both to the strong and weak: Not Those whose Eyes deep vail'd with Ignorance; Or Knowledge stain'd with Sinnes Exorbitance, Made like th'old woodden Mercuries, erect In publike Waies, the Passage to direct, Who with their finger the Right Path did point, But, with their foot could never move a joynt. How, how, should Those, for Guide and Lanthorn serve To th'Ignorance of People prone to swerve; Whose Ignorance, devoid of Learnings Light, Cannot discern from crooked Waies the right? Or, How can Those, foul, Sin-sick Soules recure (Whom Patterns more then Precepts would allure) Whose Eloquence, whose Excellence of Wit, Marres their Well-saying by Ill-doing it; While, what they Preach, in Practice they deny, And by their Deeds give their owne Words the Ly. Neither the Learned, of true Vertue void; Neither the Vertuous, without Learning's aid; Can, in the Flock of Christ's Redeemed dear, Bear th'holy Sheep-hooks sacred Burthen heer, VVith that Success which should be wisht by Them That seek the glory of Ierusalem. Learning and Vertue must together match, Those sacred Flocks duly to Weeld and Watch: In vain's their Pain, who doo not lead, but drive, Preaching like Shepheards, while like Wolves they live; Said this good Prince: and that same very Thought Which from his heart this holy Speech had brought, Brought forth th'effect: Hee did so thirst to see Religion flourish; and, through th'Industry Of Labourers, divinely Willd and Skilld, God's holy Vineyard, truly, duly tilld. Nor was His Care lesse, nor, much lesse, His Zeal Of Lawes support (Props of the Publike-Weal) So strict hee was, and so precise in Choice Of Those (not waighd but by their Merits poiz) Whom, arming with his Sword, as Delegates, Hee sent amid the Rank of Magistrates, Garnisht with Vertues, grac't with Learning, fit On bright Astræas sacred Thrones to sit. His Predecessors, winking at the Crimes, Or else constrain'd with Mischief of their Times (All given to Gain, greedy of Gold) had made Of Offices a miserable Trade: Never regarding, that they set (withall) Both Innocence, Honour, and Right, to-sale: Sold, to th'insatiate, Licence (as they please) To pill the People, vnder shewes of Ease; And let the Knave, with his full Purse, prevent The knowne long Merit of the Excellent. Hee, seeing This Abuse to ope the Gate To all Iniustice, to confound a State: The Guilty quit, the Innocent condemn'd; Wrong countenançt, Right rated, or contemn'd; And onely Favour (vnder fained Gown) O'r-ruling Iudgements, Equity put-down: Iustice, in Courts vsing her Balance bright, To waigh the Parties Money, not their Right: Bold Ignorance, in Dignities supream, Soiling their sacred Chairs with Wrongs extream; Selling too-shame-less, too-vnconscionable, What Shee, vnworthy, bought vnreasonable: Seeing, in brief, his Realms neer Ieopardy: The strength of Lawes turn'd to meer Robbery: Apparant Thefts, with Warrant vnder-handed, Not onely not condemned, but commanded: Soon as his Valour, quelling all his Foen, Had set him quiet on his Fathers Throne, Hee banisht quite This sad Confusions Cause, This fatal Death of Letters, and of Lawes; According to our Saviour's blest Example, Who, angry, chas't the Chapmen forth his Temple. Then, where hee met a well-disposed Wit, Whose Knowledge and whose Cariage, matching fit, Gave him good hope, that, beeing (free) preferd, Hee would bee th'Orphans and the Widows Guard; The Poor's Protector, in their Right to stand; No ey for Favour; and for Bribes, no hand; No Awe of Threats, and for Intreats no Ear; Laying aside, Love, Hatred, Hope, and Fear, When hee shall sit as Oracle, to doom; Where Man is vnto Man, as in God's Room: Him would this Noble Prince freely create A Chancelour, a Iudge, a Magistrate, A Dean, a Bishop; without busie Suit Of bribed Minions basely to pursue't. O ever-wished, never-hoped, Daies, Which Gold's-contempt so gilt with golden Raies, How calm you past! How was the People blest, Vnder the Lawes of such a Princes Hest! And O! How worthy Hee, in spite of Time, To bee renowned over every Clime! Through whom Integrity reviv'd again, And Sentences, ceasing to pass for Gain (As now, God wot, too-many witnes can) Were God's owne Sentence in the Mouth of Man. For, neither spar'd Hee Rigor nor Reward, Where Hee had hope, by gentle hand or hard, To conquer Vice, and that same servile Vein, Which loves not Goodnes, but for Goods and Gain; And with a heart whose Gold-Thirst never sat is, Will never till the Field of Vertve, gratis. Knowing therefore, that in a Season vitious, Wee sooner finde a Pyrrhus, then Fabricius; And wisely fearing, lest the fear of Want, Or love of Wealth, should worldly mindes supplant, And make them pass their duties bounds perchance, Whom hee to place of Honour should advance: To keep their Port, with People venerable; To bear their Charge of needfull Train and Table; Hee arm'd their Vertue against Poverty (The secret Foe to sound Integrity) With ample Stipends, able to repell The law-less Lawes of those Two Tyrants fell, Whose Iron Scepter too-too-often forces Right honest Natures to dis-honest Courses. And then, if Favour, Feud, or Avarice, To grosse Iniustice did their hands intice, Hee punisht ay their Trespass with such Rigor, That Lawes, recovering then their ancient Vigor, Seem'd That severe Example to revive, Which in the Skin of Father flaid alive (For wrong Decrees) his Sonne succeeding thrust; A bloody Doom; yet, for Iniustice, just: That after;-Iudges, by their Iudge-skin Chair, From Bribes and Brokeage might bee warned fair. Above all Crimes, his hearts just Iealousie Abhorred most Murder and Blasphemy: Nor ever did the First escape with life; Vnless by Proofs it were apparant rife, That, Self-defending, 't was vnwilling done; Forç't, deadly Stroak, by deadly Stroak, to shun: Th'other was punisht where hee sinned, just: A red-hot Iron through his Tongue was thrust; To teach Blasphemous Mouthes no more to blame That holy, high, vn-vtterable Name, Ador'd in Heav'n and Earth, and every-where; Which, even the Angels speak not, but with fear. O! how hee hated Those light, lothsom, Places, Where Venus sells her to all lewd Embraces! The Shepheard, finding, vnder Stacks or Stones, A Nest of Hornets, or a Swarm of Drones, Or Knot of Vipers, is not bent more fierce Their Cels to spoil, Themselues dispatch, disperse, Then Hee was eger, and against Them bent Seuerest Lawes, with sharpest punishment; Clensing with Fire those foule Augéan Stalls, And, to the ground, razing their filthy VValls; Lacing with lashes their vn-pittied Skin, VVhom Lust or Lucre had bestow'd therein. Him-Selfe, so chaste of Body, and of Minde (If Fame say true: who seldom soothes behinde) That neuer Hee (Rare in a Princes Life!) Knew other Venus, then his Queene and Wife. What Prince was euer, to the silly Poore, More tender-harted, either helpfull more? A many Kings haue, by high Feats in VVarr, Renownd their Names and spred their Glories farr: By wholesome Lawes Licentious Rage represt: By many Proofs their Prudence well exprest: By all the parts of Policie and Prowes, Won all the Honors earthly State allowes: But, few vouchsafe to stoope their stately eyes To th'humble Poore that on the dunghill lyes: And little think, that, in those Little ones, Christ, Christ Him-selfe vnto their Greatnes grones; Beggs at their Feer, in raggs, and hunger-driuen; And promiseth, for Bread to giue Them Heav'n. O hearts of Adamant! This pittious King From Your fell Natures was far differing. For, oftentimes from his high Throne descending, To sowe and reap the Fruits on Alms attending, All, all that could from ordinary rate In Royall Charge of Kingdom, House, and State, Be safely spar'd, with honorable Thrift, From such a heart and hand so apt to Gift; Would He bestowe in building sacred Cells, For th'Aged, Poore, Sick, Sight-lesse (Helpless els)! In ayding Widowes, whom the bliss of Bearing Made wretched, wanting for their Childrens Rearing: Redeeming Captiues, raising Doweries For honest Maydens apt for Mariages, (Whose Banes (vnaskt) still Pouertie forbad) Passing their Flower in Feares and Languors sad: In breeding Orphans, and in feeding Those Whose bashfull Silence, biting-in their Woes, Smoother'd the Sighes within their swelling brest, Which from their Mouthes meer Hunger often prest. In briefe, in pouring on all Poore, no lesse Streams of Reliefe, then Fortune of Distresse; Approuing plain, that, in most Pomp of State, Him Selfe a Man he aye did meditate. His People He so lou'd, and their Prosperitie, That, easing them of former Kings seueritie In Imposts, Tributes, Taxes, and the rest, Where-with his Kingdom had been sore opprest: He wont with Tears to bathe his Cheeks (they say) When vrging Cause compelled him to lay On his poore Subiects any new Excise, Neuer so needfull, iust, or light to prize: Which yet his Pittie rarely did permit; And onely when Bellons (pressing it) Against out Lillies some such Storm had blown, As hath too-often Empires ouerthrown. For, for the Charge of needfull Dignitie, And royall State beseeming Maiestie, Hee neuer sought from other Source to drain, Then th'euer-Springs of his owne iust Demain; Detesting th'vse of other Potentates, Who, but to gild their Pride in pompous States, Pilld all their Subiects with extreame Excesse, And then consuming it in Showes and Feasts, And scorning those whom they had eaten-vp (With-out Compassion) in a golden Cup Caroused deep their wretched Peoples blood, Whom God had giuen Them to protect, in good. What Lawes-Obliuion, what Contempt of God (Thus, this good Prince, Them, shril and sharply chod) Deaffens your Eares against so many a Plaint! Inhumane soules, who, toucht with bloody Taint, Ill Shepheards, shear not but euen flay your Fold, To turn the Skins to Cassakins of Gold; Thinke You, the Heav'ns, which hate all Tyrannie, Will wink at Yours, and let you scape so, free? No, no: they'll ruine Your vnrighteous Power; And, causing soon Your Subiects rise in Stower, The Iust Reuenger, who all Realms transfers, Of mightiest Kings shall make you School-masters: Shall break your proud Tax-puffed Scepters so, That, for th'abuse, you shall the vse forgo: Or shall so curse the cruell Policies Your Minions finde to feed your Vanities, That in Your hands your Gold shal melt away, And still the more you pill, the more you may: (Like Dropsie-sicke, the more they drink, the dryer) The more you shall deuour, the more desire: New Erisichthons, through insatiate heat, Forced in fine your Selues to teare and eate: Branding with Shame of Marks so mercie-less, So impious Pride of hearts so Pitie-less, Who burd'ning Subiects more then beare they can, Hold neither God for God; nor Man for Man. But, wither run I, on so harsh a string, Out of my Tune; to tell how This good King Reprou'd bad Princes of his Time, for pressing Their People cause-less with vncessant Sessing! Let's re-assume our Song, our proper Theam: Let's passe-by Vice: and rather couering them, Then Them recounting in eternall Story, Let vs returne to sing of Vertues Glory. How happy is the Prince, who squaring right By sacred Lawes the limits of his Might, Ioyes in Well-dooing, and as Iust as Wise, Thinks not himselfe to raign; saue Noblewise, When He his People, heeds, and hearing aye Their iust Complaints, doth in due time repay What euery Monarch (with deuotion) vowes To God and Men, when first his royall Browes (Vnder so many solemne Mysteries, With hopefull Subiects wishfull, ioyfull Cryes) Put-on the glad-sad sacred Diadem, Which instantly from thence-forth puts on Him That Robe of Power, which those doth much mis-suit Who haue not on rare Vertues richest Suit. Among such Kings, who ay, as Right directs, Measure their Greatnes by their Good-effects; Not by their Fortunes, or their Force of hand; Or many Nations vnder their Command; Was that illustrious Prince to whom we pay Heroïk Duties in this Hymnik Lay. For, while, at home, he happy Peace inioyd, Hee neuer suffer'd day to vanish voyd Of giuing Audience, and extending free Fruits of his Iustice vnto each Degree; Grieuing in minde, grudging at those, as lost, Less worthy spent, although vnwilling most; Perswaded sure, that with what eye or eare His Peoples Case a Prince doth heed and heare; With like, the Lord, in his extreame Affaires, Will looke on Him, and listen to his Pray'rs: That that same pompous, glittering glorious Slauery, Improperly calld Royall (for the Brauery) In proper speech (by due Experience scand) 'T's an Onerous-Honor, a Confin'd Command: That Kings were made for Subiects; and not they, Not They for Kings: that though both Land &amp; Sea Adore their Greatnes (Lawes Support alone) Yet, Princes Eares are not indeed their Owne; But their owne Peoples that doe humbly liue Vnder th'obedience of the Lawes They giue: That, to be briefe, of mightiest Kings that are, Labour's the Glory, and their Greatnes Care. Such sound Instructions, from his Cradle vs'd, His vertuous Mother wisely had infus'd; Which in his Princely brest digesting milde, A Man, he practiz'd what he learnd, a Childe: Ready to heare the meanest that complaine; Preferring wisely such a sacred paine Before the pleasure of the choicest Sport Could be deuis'd in Countrey or in Court: Whence in his People such Affection spreads, They bless his Birth-day, and the ground he treads; Call him their Father, and with Vowes amain Frequent the Altars for his long-long Raign: As if that Wish (the Sum of their Desire) Contained All all Prayers could require, Or vs'd to beg of Heav'ns eternall Bountie, In asking Peace, Riches, Religion, Plentie, And all the Blessings which Astræa's hand Can plant or poure vpon a happy Land. What Tracts of Art, What Tropes of Eloquences Can liuely represent to modern Princes, (So as euen Envies Selfe shall nought controule) That Self-seuere Integritie of Soule, Whose humble, patient, constant Temperance, Hath no Successor as yet had in France, Nor yet els-where: How-euer euery State Can yet admire it, none can imitate. Evrope (where euer Vice and Vertue most Haue striuen for Empire, best and worst to boast) Hath whilom seen Kings treading in the Path Of notedst Tyrants, who with Threatfull Wrath, And all the Terrors, which Mans Cruell Rage, To fright Mankinde had found in former age, Restraind their Subiects from their Deaths Conspiring: Who, so, less-daring, had the more desiring. But, This right generous Prince, still walking fit, Within the Path which Tyrants neuer hit, Onely restraind all Publique Insolence, By th'euen-born Reanes of his own Innocence. Giuing so little hold to Mal-contents, Taking, at sharp Reproofs, so small Offence, That by effect his Royall Soule did showe, That in the same no liuelier Flame did glowe, Then a Desire, so Temperate to frame-him, That all might bouldly, none might iustly, blame him. Smooth Soothers, poysoning by the Eare the hart, Pernicious Weeds, who (Ivie-like) subuert, Distort, destroy the Trees you Climbe vpon; Still feeding Vice with such Contagion, That seldom, Soules who with Applause approue Your praising them, do ought Praise-worthy loue: Vizards of Homage, Vertues Pestilence, Right ill-come were You to This Vertuous Prince, Who, shunning aye Your banefull Whisperings, As common Poisoners of the publique Springs, Abhorr'd your presence, and could better brook A miss-Fault-finder, then a Fawner's look. So much a Noble Minde, remote from Vice, Louing true Honor, loatheth Flatteries. What pleasure took Hee, how extream Delight, In Histories, where many times hee might Review himselfe; amaz'd, to read the thïngs There said of Kings; which none dare say to Kings! How was he rapt! how sweetly extased, When that diuine Eternall Will he read, VVhere, with so liberall, iust, and louing hand, God shares to His the Heav'nly-Holy-land! That which is said of Alexander's loue To Homer's Works (whose graces, all approue) May well of him, for honoring the Miracles Of th'Heav'nly Author, speaking in his Oracles: Which as a precious Treasure, richly cas't In Gold and Cedar, had he neer him plaç't; Calling it aye his ioy of Exercises, The Spur of Vertues and the Curb of Vices. If happily his Publik Cares lent Leasure, He spends it not in more contenting pleasure, Then What so sacred Studie's Fruit imparts To th'healthy Taste of true God-fearing hearts. And well appeared, by rare, rich Effects Of Vertues shining ouer all his Acts, That that diuine Seed (happy sowne the while) Fell in no Thorny, Stony, Sandy Soile. For, if that euer Soule did Vice auoid, If euer heer meer humane Spirit inioyd Prowes, Pietie, Prudence, and Iustice, mixt, VVithout the Foil of Follies Drosse betwixt (From proudest Wrong, the poorest Right defending: Disdaining Pleasures towards Vice but tending: Milde to the Meek; to Malapert, austere; To good men, Bountious; to the bad, Seuere) 'Twas This braue Prince: Whom, They do best resemble, In Whom These Vertues most of all assemble. Kings of his Time, raigning in East and West, Reuéring him for such, his Greatnes blest: Th'Afflicted Princes chose him for Refuge; The Strong, for Friend; and Those at Strife, for Iudge, When they grew weary to dispute their Cause By th'old sharp Argument Kings Furie drawes, When, Mars vsurping milde Astræa's room, In sted of words, their Swords must giue the Doom; When Iniurie with Iniury repelling, And strength of Lawes by stronger Lawes refelling (To back their Own, or Others claim to barr) They seek their Right in Might; their Peace, in War. Such vvas Saint Levvis: and Such vvas, vvel-neer, Our Own Saint Edvvard (and Eliza deer; Saue for Her Sex, the Salique Law perchance, Barrs Her Succession to the Saints of France) For all prime Vertues of a compleate Prince To make a Saint-King. And, if euer, Since, Evrope hath seen or any kingdom know'n A liuing Shrine of Both These Saints in One (Though som, Suspect of the smooth Soothing-Crime; Some-grosse Neglect of This Ingratefull Time, Too-Envie-prone, permit not So to say.) It vvill be Said and Sworne another-Day (When swelling Clowds, that dare Eclipse our Sun, Shall, by His Rayes dispersed, be vndone; And He, Himselfe, in his Own splendor shine) 'TwAs our Ivst-Master, learned and diuine. And, if that euer (for the Time to come) There haue bin Hope of like in Christendom; There was a Prince, and is a Prince with God, Whose Name is deer and deer the Dust he trod (Whose Memory My Teares must euer mix). On Whom all Eyes, in Whom all Hearts did fix: Whose Vertues Haruest ripened in his Spring, Henry vvas made a Saint, before a King, Leauing his Brother (vvhere His Best re-flowres) Sole Heire apparant to His Hopes and Ours. And, if yet, vnder Heav'ns gilt-azure Cope, There now remaine Another liuing Hope Of new Saint Levvis, or His like again, For godly-goodly, gracious, glorious Raign, With Blisse to Britan, and the Sacred Flock, Not built on Peter's Rome, but Peter's Rock; This, This is Hee: My Patrone and my Prince, Panaretvs; Whose Pupil-Excellence Boads, to his Age, to make This Poëm seem No Poëm, but a Prophecie of Him. For, neuer vvas there Sonne more like to Sire, In face, or grace, or Ought that Wee admire; Then is Our Charles, in his yong Vertues Spring, Like th'happy Non-Age of that Holy King (Like his Owne Father; like his Onely Brother, So as Hee seems rather The same, then Other) For Gracious Gifts, and Natiue Goodnes tilld By like graue Tutors, in their Function skilld. O Thou All-Giuer! Fountain of all Good! Poure daily downe vpon This Hopefull Bud Thy Deawes of Grace: shine on it from aboue In mildest Rayes of Mercie and of Loue: In sted of Suckers, send it Succours still, To feed the Root, that That the rest may fill With liuely Verdure of a fruitfull Sap, To load with Plentie euery Vertuous Lap: Breathe on it Blessings: leaue no Weed with-out, Nor VVorme vvith-in it: hedge it round-about From Boares, and Beasts, domesticall and Stranger; Both Wylde and Wylie (Where least Dread, most Danger.) That it may kindly spring, and timely spred, In bulk and Branch, with leaues that neuer shed: Vnder vvhose Shade mine Aged Muse may vvarble Some Monument (out-lasting Brasse and Marble) In Swan-like notes, to My Mecœnas Honor, When Hee bestowes some Nest of Rest vpon-her. Nor may my Vowes ingratefully forget Our Other Branch (in Other Soile new-set) Whose tender Leaues shaken with Sighs of Ours, In sted of Tears, haue dropped Siluer showers To coole My Thirst, my Cares to cure, or calm, With timely Vse of Bounties princely Balm. O Sea of Bounties neuer-dryed Source! So vvater it vvith-Thy rich Fauors Course, That, Happy thriuing by her Palatine, The Royall Issue of Their Rosie-Vine, From Rhine and Ister, may to Tiber spred; And, ouer-topping Romes vsurping Head, From Bramble-Kings recouer Caesars Seat, With greater Sway then Constantine the Great. Great Arbitrer, vvhose Counsails none can sound; Who canst all Thrones confirm, and all confound; Conferring Kingdoms, and transferring them, How, When, and Where thou vvilt, from Stem to Stem; Establish, Lord, in Royall Iames his Race, These Kingdoms Greatnes, and Thy Kingdoms Grace: Prosper our David, bless his Salomon, That after Them, vpon Great-Britain's Throne (Maugre Hells malice, and the Rage of Rome, Their roaring Bulls, their Charms, their Arms to-come, Their Powder-Plots, their Pistols, Poysons, Kniues; And All their Iesuites murdrous Art contriues) Their Seed may sit; and neuer Other hand Then Stvarts sway the Sceptre of This Land; Wise, Great, Good Stvarts, that may shine as cleer As This Saint Levvis, both in Heav'n and Heer. AMEN. HENRIE THE GREAT (The Fourth of that Name) LATE King of France and Navarr: HIS Tropheis and Tragedie. Written in French By Piere Mathiev. To the Right Honorable William Cecill, Earle of Salisbury. Besides the Bonds which did most Vowes engage To your deere Elders; and besides the Due Which to your Selfe might iustly thence accrew; Th'apparant Vertues of our April-age, Challeng'd of right This Poëms Patronage: The rather, sith wee first receiu'd from you, The speedy Notice (no lesse quick than true) Of Henry's Death, through Hells dis-chained Rage. You saw this Sunne, at his High-Noone shine Set In suddaine Clowd of his owne Royall Bloud. O Horrid Hap! Who euer can forget Such Fate such Hate; of one so Great, so Good: O! Iust Revenge, root out th'Ignatian Pack, The Moules that moou'd in Faux and Rauaillac. Iosvah Sylvester. THE TROPHEIS OF THE VERTVES AND Fortune of Henrie the Great. Since first Apollo lent the World his light, And Earth empregned with his heatfull might, Europ hath seene no Potentate, no Prince, To Parallel Great Henry's excellence. No Terme, no Time, his fresh Renown shall shed: Neuer was King more deare, neuer more dread. Phœnix of Kings, wonder of Christendome, Passing all past, and without Peere to come; His Courage only matcht His Clemencie, And should his Tomb to These Two equall be, Both Spain and France, could not containe the same, Which haue so often seen his feates of Fame. His Life's a lamp to Princes, and a line; A Trophey rear'd by Miracle diuine; A Theater to all the Vertues built; A goodly Garden, with such plenty fild Of choisest fruits and flowers, that chusing, there Aboundance troubles more then Want else-where. The yeer that Edvvard in Great Britane dy'd: That France (beyond the mountains) Spain defi'd: That Therwin walls were thundered to the ground: That a faire flower our Royall Hymen Crownd: I'th' winter Solstice (when the yeare is worn) Within Pau Castle This young Mars was born: Born for the Worlds Good: as his Enterance Presag'd him then the Hercvles of France; To re-aduance her Lillies long decayd: For as (by chance) bare-head abroad he playd, At foure yeers old, a Snake he finds and kills; At forty, foiles the Hydra of our Ills. Nor was He bred in soft delicious wise (Which forms young Spirits into the form of Vice): His Grandsire vs'd him to all VVeathers Ire, His Sauce was Labour, Exercise his Fire, His noble Heart did neuer ought inflame, Saue Heauens desire, and th'Honour of the same. Scarce fourteen times had he beheld the-birth Of th'happy Planet (which præsag'd his Worth) Predominant in his Natitiall; When he became an Armies Generall, Whose hottest flame, without Him was but fume; Nor, but by Him, durst any good presume. He purchast Peace, the which eftsoones was staind With His friends bloud, and his young soule constaind To faine some Change of His Religion: At Vinseine Castle He was seiz'd vpon, And to the Court confin'd; where, discontent, His Spirit droopes, out of His Element. Escaped thence: with restlesse toyle, He tends To saue the Side of his Afflicted Friends; By peace again he bringeth all in vre: And Mounsieur's death doth well his Hopes assure Of th'after Crown, who but between him stood; So, now was He the first Prince of the Blood. Then from afarre he doth new Storms discry: To threat his fortune, and his force to try: He meets the danger with vndaunted front, And in foure yeres beares ten braue Armies brunt, All with the might of a great Monarch graç't; Whereof, at Coutras he defeats the last. At last, the King to extreame Streights reduç't, In doubt of all, and daring none to trust, Implores This Prince, who rescues him from Tours, With iust Reuenge; and had, yer many houres, Re-humbled Paris to her Princes yoake, But for Saint Clements Paricidiall stroake. After which stroak (which all true French-men hate) France sadly falls in a most wretched state: Who hath least Reason, hath most Insolence; Who hath most Power, hath least Obedience. Nor Awe, nor Law; Disorder euery-where: Good, without hope, and Wicked without feare. Rebellion spaunes as fast as (in the Spring) Fruit-frettting vermine; it doth Discord bring In Families, dearth in Townes, death in Field: O! happy you who neuer daign'd to yeeld Vnto that Hagge; but, Loyall to the Crowne, Haue left your Heires, Heires of a true renowne. Who counts the Cares that on a Crown doe wait, As well may number Autumnes fruitfull fraight, And Floras too. Yet this great spirit of man, Mid th'ebbs and flouds of This vast Ocean, Seems a still Ship, which maugre Winds and Waues, In wished Hau'n her and her Burthen saues. Hee's neuer idle, nor his Exercise Other than stands with princely offices: Mars and Diana, and Cvpid wait on Him: Maugre his Losse, hee alwaies gaines by Time. Vnto Affaires his eares are open aye, Nor waits hee lazying on his bed for day. Shafts, Tigers, Torrents; no, nor Lightning flies More swift about, than This bold E?gle plies (Amid all perils) to preserue his State, With Heed and Speed, from Rebels Pride and Hate. In Battells first, last in Retreats: in brief, In Action, Souldier; in Direction, Chief. Diepe saw his Fortunes on a desperate Dy; The League presum'd he needs must yeeld or fly: But, as a Brook, the more we stop his Course, Breaks down his Bay, and runs with swifter force, He foiles his Foes at Arques, and shewes them plain, That Heauens iust hand doth his dear Right sustain. 'Tis buzz'd in Paris, and beleeu'd in part, That he is taken; or constraind to start From Diepe to Douer, to seek Englands Aide: And, while Him comming Prisoner-wise, they said, To the Bastile; He came and ouer-came Their Suburbs soon, to their Suborners shame. Conquest attends him, whether he encamps, Or marches on: again he takes Estampes: Lizieux, Eureux, Mans, Meulan, Vandosme, Perch, And Honfleur, formost in His Trophie march; As earnest-pence of his recouer'd State, And Crowne of France, which well admits no Mate. Tiber and Iber then together flow (Too strong in wrong) his Right to ouer-throw. There proudeth Power, Heer Prowess brighter shines; And daily shewes vs by a thousand Signes, How great Aduantage a true Birth-right brings (Against Vsurpers) vnto lawfull Kings. In Ivry Fields, he seems a Blazing Star; Seen in the Front of all his Host, afar: Maiestick Fury in his Martiall Face, The brauest Troops, doth in an instant Chase: And boldest Rebls, which the rest had led, Came Charging one way, and by forty Fled. Melun surrenders, to his War-like Lot, Chartros is chastizd with his thundring Shot, Louuiers lyes humbled at his Conquering Foot, Noyon lamenteth her Three Succors rout, Espernay yeelds her wholely to his hest, Dreux twise besieged, opens as the rest. The League, that late so violently burn'd, To a Cold Feuer now her Frenzie turn'd; And trusting still in Strange Physycians aid, Neglects her Cure till all her strength decaid: In dread of all, In doubt her owne will quaile; As a weak Ship affraid of euery Saile. That (late) Achilles of the Spanish-Dutch, Farnezean Parma that atchieu'd so much In Anwerp's Siege, by match-lesse Stratagem; And weend the World had had no Peer to Him: Had here the heart, twice, to refuse to Fight; And twise departed, and bade none Good-Night. Fortune, for Him, no longer vs'd her Wheel: But, kind and constant, followes at his heel: He's Happy euery where, and ouer all Spring Palmes and Lawrels: only neer Aumale A murderous Bullet put him to some pain, Yet hindred not His Rescue of his Train. Who weens to vanquish Him, makes Him invict; Milde to the Meek, to Proudlings stern and strict: He loues the Lawrels without blood be-sprent, A Cruell Conquest He doth euen lament. His Thunder batters but Rebellious Walls: And who least fear him, on them first he falls. France, Selfe to slay, and her owne Throat to Cut, Arms her owne hands; and (in strange rage) doth put The Knife to whet, in Spaines ambitious pawes; Spain that would Spoile her Crowns primordial Lawes, And would a Scepter with a Distaffe Blin: But all in vain: The Lillies cannot Spin. Re-Romaniz'd, so (say They) Heauen coniures; His Errors at Saint Denis he abiures: This Change, in Court yet chang'd not one nor other; For, though his Subiects haue not all one Mother, He holds them all his Sons, They him their Sire; And Christians all, all to one Heav'n aspire. Within the Temple of The Mother-Maid, That bore her Son, her Sire, her God, her Aid, With Heav'n-sent Oyle He is anointed King, Dons th'Order-Collar; and by euery thing, To proue, in him, Saint Lewis Faith and Zeale, The Sick he touches, and his Touch doth heale. By law of Arms, a Citie tane by Force, Should feele the Victors rage, with small remorse. Paris so taken, is not treated so: Though well his Iustice might haue razed lowe Those rebell Wals which bred &amp; fed These Wars; To saue the guilt-less, He the guilty spares. There, There's the Hope and Safety of His Side; If There he faile, then farewell all beside: The Spaniard therfore thither speedy sends, A great strong Conuoy to confirm His Friends. Which soon defeated, There began the End Of Ciuill Wars, and all to Vnion tend. Th'Honor of falling and restoring France, Is not alone due to His Valiance: His Clemencie hath part; which lets him in To stronger Holds, than all his Arms could win: That, satisfied with Tears, makes from all parts, Repentant Rebels yeeld him vp their Hearts. Lyons, the Porter of one Part of France, Rov'n, that sees none like strong in Ordinance, Orleans, which England did vndaunted proue, Marcëillis, iealous of old Neptune's loue, Aix, Bourges, Sens, Meaux, Poictiers, Troy, Thoulouse, And Reins; of These, each to his Bounty bowes. This gracious Prince excus'd the simpler sort, Whom (Malice-lesse,) blind Passions did transport Against the Lawes, with fury of the Time; Who self-affraid to fail in fowler Crime, Seduç't by others slie seditious Lore, Follow'd (like Sheep) their Fellowes straid before. This heauenly-humane Clemency of His, Yet cannot shield Him from some Treacheries. One wounds him in the Mouth, and breaks withall One of his Teeth, (O Act vnnaturall!) And had not God in part put-by the blowe, Euen then in Paris had he perisht so. But, hauing quencht the Ciuill Fires in France, Gainst his ill Neighbors now his Arms aduance; In Predmont Fields his Lilly-flowers he plants, Pills Bourgognie and all Artois He dants, And makes the great Castilian Mars to fly, With Feare, Within; without, with Infamy. Then, those great Warriors that had disobeyd (Whom not their Courage but their Cause betray'd) Which came with shame and sorrow (as was meet) To cast their swords at his victorious Feet, Fearing his Rigor: He receiues them (rather) With King-like grace, and kindnesse like a Father. Heauen daily works, for Him, some special Miracle: His Faith's an Altar, and his Word an Oracle: His greatest foes haue neuer found him faile. And should Sincerity in all men quaile, Exiled from the World (as Moors from Spain) In This Kings soule she had been found againe. Spain by a train of many VVyles well laid, Surpriseth Amiens, France is all affraid: The Spaniard, hence prouder then euer, swells: Vndanted Henry Thence him soon repells, Regains his Citie, and constrains His foes, To beg their Peace, or to abide his blowes. The Storms that long disturbd the State are val'd, Th'ill Vapors now are from all hearts exhal'd, And France is now all French, euen all about: Only the Breton stifly yet, stood out. But, those white Ermines at the last must need, Of th'only Sent of the faire Lillies feed. Old Philip longs to see the Waters calme, Finds all designes vaine to supplant This Palme; Sith the more shaken, it more fast doth grow: He seeketh Peace, the Pope solicits so, Veruins doth treat it, Bruxells sweares it don, And Philip pleas'd departs the World anon. France yet retains one sensible Offence, For which she vowes Reuenge or Recompence: Among the Alps her thundring Canons roare, Proud-browd Montmeilan flaunts and vaunts the more To stop her fury, but in fine is fain To rue her rashnesse and repent in vain. God hastens his owne Work: This Monarch marries In Lyons Church, the choice, the Chief of Maries; The Heauens delight, our Lilies ornament: Looe, in one heart two louely Soules hath blent; Whence Peace is more confirm'd, and Discord dasht. For, by This knot many great Plots are quasht. At Fountainbleau (a Paradise for site) She brought him forth his Dolphin, his delight, Whose tender youth giues happy hopes of Worth; One Daughter also did she there bring forth, And two Sons more (Supporters of the Crowne: Two daughters more, Paris for birth doth owne. His Clemency hath conquered Rebels rage, Made of dis-loyall loyall Vassalage; Yea forced Wils by Pardons and by Grace, The proof whereof is writ in euery place; Through all the Townes of France both great and small; Where, for Reuenge, Reward was daign'd to all. Once, only once, his Mercy admirable, Was deafe to Biron, and inexorable; Sith when he might, his hault despight would none. I wonder not to see that Myrmidon, In the Bastile, a shamefull death to beare: But This I wonder, that he would come there. Of factious spirits, of close deep hearts and double (VVhose Life is strife, whose, Rest is best in trouble, He knowes the drifts, and knowen dissolues the same, As fast as fire melts Lead within the flame. His voyce alone, as Dust cast vp aloft, Breakes Hornets buzzing and their swarming, oft. Discord, disturbing holy Churches rest, Twixt Rome and Venice did debates suggest: Ambition set-in foote, fore-sweld with hope, To bridle both the Senat and the Pope; Both prest to fight: His Prudence reconcil'd Their Difference, and did their mindes remil'd. He relisht now the harmeless Sweets of Peace, Willing his People should partake no lesse; But yet some-where he feeles a Thorne to prick: To pluck it out, he armes and marches quick, Euen to the Frontier: There attaines his will, Wisedom (so) fitly takes her Season still. You nations, that for fortie yeers haue seen Bellona's Tempests, and felt Mars his Teen; That for your Liberties haue pawnd your Liues: If freely now you ioy your Wealth, your Wiues: If now your Trades into the East you bring, (Vnder Heauens Kingdom) onely thank this King. Thus heapt with Honors, This braue King is loath That his braue Knights, effeminiz'd by Sloath, 'Mid Games and Dames, during so long a Peace, Should still ly still in Cities pomp and ease: Therefore he rears an Army strongly dight, In Gulich's Claim, his wronged friends to right. A noble Prince, whose Prowes and Prudence, late Buda admir'd, and Rome hath wondred-at (The Honor of His Time) was Generall; So stoard with Gold, with Guns, with Arms, with all, That neighbor Princes all were in alarm: Yet Them This Thunder brought more feare then harm. Fearless it marches; and, respectless, threats What-euer Log its ready Passage lets; Gesture and voice already skirmishing, And vnder Conduct of so braue a King, Great-Britaines, Germans, Switzers, Belgians, Serue all the Greatnes of the Crown of France. Else-where, the while, The Duke that rules the Alpes, Seemd t'haue his heart no more beyond the Calpes; Braue noble heart, Saxonically-French. Fuentez, affraid, with shoulder-shrinking wrench, Doubts lest that Milan stoop to France againe; And Charles prouoked proue the Scourge of Spaine. Heau'ns now, to Crown his Tropheis, had set down, That at Saint Denis he his Queen should Crown With royall Diadem; and in one Day The State, the Maiesty of France display. Nothing but Great; but great Magnificence; But, Maries Grace excell'd all Excellence. Hence, hence false Pleasures, momentary Ioyes; Mock vs no more with your illuding Toyes: A strange Mishap, hatched in Hell below, Hath plung'd vs all in deepest Gulfe of Woe, Taught vs that all Worlds-hopes as Dreams do fly, And made vs all, Cry All is Vanitie. Four houres from Noon, forth from the Louure rode This mighty Prince (without his Gard) abroad, To see His Arcenall: To his Caroche, In a streight Lane, a Hell-hound durst-approche; And with a knife, twice stabbing, kill'd hin quite, Turning that fairest Day to foulest Night. Twice did the Monster stab: for else, the first Had not been mortall; but the knife, accurst, Thrilling his Lungs, cut at the second stroake Th'artereal vein, whose bloud-floud soon did choak The peerless Prince; His dying Eyes and Hart Imploring Heauen, soon did his Soule depart. Fell Tyger, tell vs, tell vs Why, or Whence, Thou durst (accurst) assault so Great a Prince? Wherein had He to Thee or Thine done wrong? When once (yer this) Thou didst too neer him throng, His Gard rebuk't thee; but, He Them, for That. Caus'd That Thy Malice, and His Murderous fate? Fates ruthless Law allots his royall brest To die the death that Caesar thought the best; Death without sense of death, a death so quick, It fildome leaues Kings leisure to be sick; Nor giues Him leaue of his sixt Decads date To fill the Roule; but, seauen six Months did bate. He, He that was the Hope, the Prop of His, He that restored France to what it is, He that confin'd the Power of Princes still, He that Commanded Victory at will, That was the Worlds delight, Kings glory sheen, He, He receiues Deaths treacherous stroak vnseen. Th'vnhappy street where This fell Hap fel-out, Where wofull Paris saw her Light put-out, Where cursed Iron pearç't her Princes hart, It shall no more be clept The Iron-mart: It shall be call'd The cursed Corner, still; The Hag-street, or The Hell-street: which you will. Lord! where wert Thou, when that disloiall wretch With cruell hand did Thine Anointed reach; Quenching the Raies of Royall Maiestie? No heart is hid from thine All-pearcing Eye, It sees the Centre, knows the thoughts, yer thought; Could it see This, and suffer it be wrought? Hell oft before, out of his black Abyss, Had spew'd vp Monsters to haue acted This: But, still thy hand from former wounds did ward. And had he not still trusted to Thy Gard, His Owne had waited Round about his Coach, And This fell Tiger neuer should approach. These Words, these rasher Words escapt my tong; When I beheld That Monarch layd along Dead on his Bed; so dead, so butchered: I blamed Heauens, and Whispering soft, I said, Because They stopt not This strange Hap before, Their slumbring eyes now watch the World no more. But, are mine eyes mine owne? Is This That Prince Which might haue made all Europe His, long since, Had he not thought th'Empire of France enough; That Lion-heart, that Courage Cannon-proofe, Which did so oft Impossibles atchieue? I see tis He: yet scarce my sight beleeue. Is This That Mighty King, Gods liuely Image, To whom the greatest in the World did Homage? In Peace a Doue, in Warre an Ægle quick, Nestor in Court, in Camp Achilles-like; That with a hundred horse, a thousand foil'd: That from most Dangers neuer yet recoil'd. Great Rome was strangely maz'd and all a-mort, When She beheld her Caesar's bloody shirt: And say, Great Citty, how wert Thou dismayd, When first thou saw'st Thine Henry sadly layd Along his Coach, and couered with a Cloak? “I thought the Prop of all my Fortunes broak. Those that haue seen in Townes surpris'd (while-yer) When to the Churches All haue fled for feare, May well imagine Paris deepe Affright. Nothing but shiuering: Nobles armed bright, Clergy at Prayers, People weep and houle: And Henry's wound hath wounded euery Soule. Paris in Honour of her peerless Queen, Had plotted Showes (more pompous neuer seen) As, rich to th'outward, rare to th'inward sense; But, all those Archs Marks of Magnificence), Those Tropheis, Terms, Statues, Colosses, All, Make but more Mourners at the Funerall, I yeeld My Pensill: help Apelles, heere, To Limn (to life) Her dying-liuing Cheere: Beleefe is hardly in Mans heart imprest, Her Griefe more hard to be by Art exprest. Therefore O Queen! Great Stay, Great Star of France, This Vaile I draw before Thy Countenance. Heauen steel'd Thy Hart with Fortitude That Day, Thy Courage kept the Kingdom from Decay; And to the Throne Thy Son our Soueraign heft: Though angry Fates of Father him bereft, Yet Mercifull, they left him such a Mother, That France could hardly haue been rul'd by other. The suddain Clap of This drad Thunder sounds, From Alexander's to Alcides Bounds: The Kings and Princes stand amazed all, With horror of an Act so Tragicall. Some, Rest forsake: others, Repast forbeare: And Each, like Fortune to himselfe doth feare. So suddainly to see Day turn'd to Night, Triumphant Palmes, into Funereal Plight, The Royall Crown to a deep Mourning Vale, A liuing King, to a dead Corps and pale, Our Flowers to Thorns; seem Tricks of Sorcery, Wherein, Conceit consents not with our Eye. Yes, He is dead: and his eye-lids no more To view this Light shall open (as before); Those louely Eyes, the Load-starrs of the Court, Whose gracious glances, on the Worthy sort, Gaue Vertue vigor; and Whose awfull frowne Dis-dared Vice; are now Eclipst and downe. Where are those ready Battaile-ranging Hands? Those lightning Eyes whose wrath no wall with-stands? That Voice so dreadfull to the stoutest harts? That Heart which wrought so many wondrous parts? That pearcing Wit, dispersing Clowds of Doubt? Where is that mighty King, so Fam'd about? Inexorable Death! inhumane, cruell, Thou shalt no more reaue vs so rare a Iewell; Nature hath broke the Mould she made Him in. In all thy Triumph (trayling euery Kin) Shall neuer march His Match, nor worthier Prince T'haue been exempted from thine Insolence. Ah! poore, weak Vertue, zealous Loue of Thee, Prolongs not Life, protracts not Death (I see). This Prince that gaue Thee euen his Heart for Temple, This Prince, whose Raign shal serue for rare Exemple To future Kings, in future Things dismaid, Should haue come sooner, or haue later stayd. His Pietie, was neither Fond, nor Faind; His Prowesse, neither Feare, nor Rashnes staind; His Prudence clear'd his Councells, steerd his State; His Temperance his Wrath did temperate; His Iustice with his Clemencie did Yoake: Yet could not All free Him from Fatall stroake. Inuincible in all: only, the Darts, Which haue not spar'd the Gods immortall harts, Haue often batterd His: but by your leaues, O fairest Bewties! Bewtie it self deceiues). You neuer were the Souerains of his brest: He You (perhaps) You neuer Him possest. In Arms-Art, what He knew not, none can know't, Neither attempt what He attempted not. Reason was aye the Aime of His designes: His braue Exploits (worthie immortall lines) Shall furnish Theam to Thousand learned Clarks, Whose Works shal Honor Him, He more their Warks. His Royall Gests are euery-where extold, Grauen, Carued, Cast, in Marble, Wood, and Gold; His Life alone's an History admir'd, Wherein all Pens, all Pencills shall be tir'd, In pourtraying all His valiant Feats to-forn, Whose Tables euer shall all Courts adorn. His Bounties Temple had a hard Accesse, Not known to any but to Worthinesse: That Gate (indeed) did seldom open quick. His Liberality, (coy Bewty-like) Lou'd to be woo'd, prest, and importun'd still; Yea, forç't to giue, what glad and fain she will. Yet, by th'effects to waigh his Clemencie, Me thinks His Heart must more then humane be, Me thinks therein some higher Power did shine, It surely seem'd celestiall and diuine: And but I saw him dying, pale and wan, I could haue scarce beleeu'd This Prince a Man. He euer lou'd rather to saue then spill, Not cementing his Throne with Blood, with Ill; Nor ween'd, by Feare his Diadem assur'd; With mildenes rather, grieued minds he cur'd: His Memory did neuer wrongs retain; Beloued Kings, He thought, securest raign. Praise you his Bounty, you that, past the Poles, Beare Heauens, Embassage to Belief-less Soules: Henry restor'd your Countrey, and your Credit, He gaue you leaue ouer all France to spred it; Restor'd you Bizance, and each pleasant part, Left you his Court, bequeath'd to you his Heart. If France now flourish, proyning, round about, Oliues within, and Lawrels all without, If now, She giue the Law to other States, If Peace and Plenty raigne within her Gates, If now She feare no Ciuill Storms again, These are the fruits of This Great Henry's Raign. If now Her Schooles with learned men abound, If Her rare wits be through the World renownd, If doubts of Faith be cleared and explor'd, If Learning be to her due Place restor'd, If now Desert the Charge in Church attain, These are the Fruits of This Great Henry's Raign. If now her Buildings passe for bewty farre The Worlds old Wonders (Which so famous are) If Paris Thou be peerlesse to behold, For State, for Store, for people, Goods, and Gold, If in thy Citie, Cities sprout again, These are the Fruits of This Great Henry's Raign. If the French Scepter be now Self-entire, Fear-less of Forain or Domestick fire: If France haue Fellowes of Achilles Fame; If now in France be nothing out of frame, If now the Indies her Bastile containe; These are the Fruits of this Great Henry's Raign. If now we ioy to see our Countrey free From Theeues and Rebels (which exiled be): If Iustice now doe keep the lewd in awe, If Desperate Duels be now curbd by Law, If now the Weak waigh not the Strongs disdain, These are the Fruits of This Great Henry's Raign. If Merchants rich, If Magistrates be sound, If Officers like Emperors abound, If Pursie Lawyers liue Prince-like at home, If now Inuentions to their height be come, If now good wits find where them to sustaine, These are the fruits of This Great Henry's Raigne. Who lou'd not Him, neuer beheld his browes, Who knew his Fortunes, must admire his Prowes, Who feard him not, His greatnes did offend, Who weend Him to beguile, his Wisdom kend: Who durst displease Him, knew his mercies store; Who durst not speak, his mildnes did ignore. Who waileth not his Death, knew not his Life, Glory of His and Others Enuie rife, Incomparable, Admirable Prince, Excelling all th'old Heroes Excellence. For, His true Story shall their Fables shame: Inimitable Life, Illimitable Fame. O French-men, stop not yet your weeping flood: This Prince for you hath lauisht oft his blood. O! be not niggards of your Tears expence, (Vaile heer, my Verse, do Anne a reuerence; Rare Anne that shames the rarest wits of Ours, Her diuine Stances furnish thee these Flowers). The Heauens may giue vs all Prosperities, Sustain our State, remooue our miseries; But cannot dry vp our Tears bitter streame: In extreame Euills remedies extreame. Restore our King, quick shall our Ioyes recouer: Els, neuer look our Sorrowes should giue-ouer. Each-where our Grief finds matter to augment it, His Names remembrance doth each-where present it, His famous Gests do busie euery Sort, Some tell his Warres, others his Works report. Others his Fauours past, glad-sad deplore; Then, not to mourn, is not to mind Him more. Ah! must we liue, and see so sodain dead The Life that late our Liues inspirited? Strike saile my Soule, let's put into the Port, While Henry liu'd 'twas good to liue (in sort): But let vs after: sith Hee's reft of breath, Desire of Life is now farre worse then Death. Sorrow, with vs doth both lie-downe and rise, Wrinkles our Browes, withers our Cheeks and Eyes: We shun what-euer might our Griefs allay, We wish the Night, w'are weary of the Day, Night brings sad Silence with her horrid Shade, And euen hir Colour seems for Mourning made. Extreamest Woes yet are with Time ore-past, Riuers of Teares are dryed vp at last: But neuer Ours; Our, euer fresh shall flow: We defie Comforts, We'll admit no mo, Nor seek them, but as Alchimy profound Seekes that which is not, or which is not found. Who, from the Ocean, Motion can recall, Heat from Fire, Void from Aire, Order from All, From Lines their Points, from Iris all her Dyes, Perils from Seas, from Numbers Vnities, Shadowes from Bodies, Angles from the Square, May free our Hearts from Grief, our Mindes from Care. He must be hart-less that is smart-less found: The Soule that is not Wounded with This wound, Most brutish, hath no humane Reason in't: There is no brest of Steel, no heart of Flint, But must be-mone so great a King, so slain. Who would not waile a Gally-slaue so taine? Let vs no more name Hevryes, Kings of France. Death with two Kniues, and with one shiuer'd Lance, Hath kild Three Henry's: one at Iousts (in iest): Th'other in's Closet; in's Caroche, the best: So, Three King Richards, and Fiue Other, cry, Some fatal Secret in some Names doth lie. What worse Disastre can you haue behinde, To threaten France? O Destinies vnkinde! What greater Mischief can your Malice bring? So good a Father reft, so great a King? What will you more? sith we no more can hope For any Good that with This Ill may cope. This noble Spirit doth to his Spring re-mount, This Bounties Flood retireth to his Fount, This Atomie to's Vnity vnites, This Star returns to the first Light of Lights, This Ray reuerts where first it light did take: And mortall wounds, This Prince immortall make. Fare-well sole Honour of all earthly Kings, Fare-well rare Prince for All kinde Managings, Fare-well Great Henry, Heav'ns and Natures Gem, Fare-well bright Star of Kings, Glories great Beam, Fare-well sole Mortall that I keep in minde: Fare-well false Hope, fortune, and Court vnkinde. Heer, lest Obliuion should vsurp her roome, FAME writes in Gold, These Lines vpon thy Toomb. This Prince, vn-Peerd for Clemency and Courage, Iustly Sur-nam'd, the Great, the Good, the Wise, Mirror of Future, Miracle of Fore-Age; One short Mis-hap for-euer Happifies. FINIS. THE BATTAIL OF YVRY: OR THE BREAK-NECK of The Hellish-Holy Leauge; In That famous Victorie vvonne By HENRY the Great; Written By Du Bartas: Translated, &amp; Dedicated To The Right Honorable, RICHARD, EARLE of DORSET, By Iosvah Sylvester. TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE Earle of Dorset. As th' awefull Child, that long hath truanted, Dares not return vnto the Schoole, alone; For Shame and Feare to be there discipled With many Stripes for many Faults in One: So fares (my Lord) My long Omission Of th'humble Thanks I ought haue tendered For kinde Endeuors You bestowd vpon My Right, my Wrong to haue recouered. And as (in fine) He brings his Mother forth To beg Forgiueness, or his Fault to scuse: So bring I heere My deer Du Bartas Worth, To mediate for My too-faultie Muse; Whom daign to pardon: and in gentle Part Accept This last of His, not least in Art.

What a Hymne of Triumph troule they out, In all our Temples! O! What cheerfull noyse! What Bels! What Bonfires! O! What Publique-Ioys! The Day is Ours: and on the Leaguers head, The angry Heav'ns haue their iust Vengeance shed. Be smooth, my Browes; and You, my throbbing thoughts (Long, deeply sunk in Sorrowes sable Vaults) Soar-vp to Heav'n: You Sisters Three-fold-Three, Who of late Yeers have scarce vouchafed Mee To wet my lips: Now sweetly steep my Tongue In your best Syrups: poure, vpon This Song, A deaw of Gold, a May of learned Flowers. Let not mine Eyes, blubberd with private Showres, Cross publique Glee: nor (silent) Me conceale, While Others sing, These Tropheys of our Weale. Ah! now begins my rapted Brain to boile With brave Invention: Now's the fittest while For my Career. Others may hold their tongue; But, hardly can great Ioyes be hidden long. But now; How, Where, of What, shall I begin This Gold-grownd Web to weave, to warp, to spin? For, heer I list not, in these leaves, my Lord, The famous Facts of thy first Arms record: So many, and so numbery Armies scatterd, So many Towns defençt, so many batterd By Thy young Valour. Nither shall my Pen Re-purple Lisle; nor with dead Grease agen Re-soile the Soile at Courtras: neither (dread) Heer reave again thy Ragefull Foes of Head. Nor shall my Muse relate, how that yer-while (Abusing King's and Churche's sacred stile) All Evrope nigh (all sorts of Rights reneg'd) Against the Truth and Thee, vn-holy leagu'd; While Thou (a Prince, not having Men, nor Treasure, But poor, in All; save rich in Hope past measure) Resemblest right one of thy Hils in Foix, Which stands all Storms, firm'd by it selfs sad poiz, Boldly beholds the frowning Vpper-Stage, Disdaining Winds, deriding Weathers rage: And with his brows cleaving the proudest Thunder, With knobbed knees still keeps it bravely vnder. Nor may I now our Thoughts cleer Heav'n o'r-cast, With Clowdy Theam of Miseries fore-past. Nor cruelly begin again to launce New-skinned wounds, to the new griefe of France. Sing Others Those: Me shall suffice to sing, That in few Months, since Thou wert heer Our King, Thy valiant hand hath more strong places won Then Both the Sides in thirty yeers have don. Though Swarms besieg'd, in number did surmount Besieging Troops, in so vn-equall count, That oft there seemd of Foes more Troops (almost) Then single Souldiers in thy Royall Host. Thou seem'st a Lightning, and thy nimble Bands Follow thy will rather with wings, then hands; And impt with plumes of Honor-thirsting minds, Are bravely born with Thy Good-fortunes winds: Thou cam'st, saw'st, overcam'st, as swift well-neer As these swift Words I have digested heer. Only, neer Arques, for few dayes, the Foe Thine Expeditions som-what doth fore-slowe: But as a Torrent, whose proud stream for stop, Hath the thick height of som new Causwaies top; The Bottom vndermines, beats on the shore, And still (in vain) adds Forces more and more, Till, at the last, aided with Showres and Snowes, Fell, foaming, lowd, his Prison over-throwes, Tears Bridges down, bears away Mounds and Mills, And having won the Valleys, threats the Hills; Swels as a Sea, and in his furious Pother Takes Land from som, and giveth more to other: So thou re-Campst, runn'st, rushest, ruinest Holds, Houses, Towns, and never doost thou rest, Till rebell Paris, pale for guilty Feare, Behold thy Face with too-iust Fury there, In her vast Sub-urbs; Sub-urbs flanked strong; Sub-urbs, whose streets with Souldiers thickly throng: Thou tak'st Estamps: and losing scarce a man, Thy martiall Troops ingratefull Vandosme wan. Mans is assaild, and taen; Falaise, Eureux: Mayne followes those; and after that Lizieux, And Honfleur too, stoop to thy Sacred Flowers. And now began thy Sulphury Thunder-stowers To batter Dreux: when as the Leaguers Chief, Puft with som new Supplies, and fresh Relief, From fatall Philip (who right Foxy-Wise, Wide yawning still after so rich a Prize; Ambitious waits, nor wishes nothing more, Then that our Great each other enter-gore, In Civill Rage; that at the easier rate, Himselfe may snatch the Price of Their debate) Drawes neer thine Host. Then Thou, whose Fear was great Least He too-feard thee, fainedst a Retreat, Seemst loth to fight, seemst thy hault Heat to slack: And, to leap further, stepst a little back. Thou stopst, He flies; Thou follow'st, then He stands: And now, both Sides for Battail range their Bands: They seem two Forrests: every Chief, apart, Darrains his Troops with order, speed, and art. The Lightning-flash from swords, casks, courtilaces, With quiv'ring beams begilds the neighbour grasses; As th'Host of Stars, which shine above so bright, Bespangles rich the Mantle of the Night. The Souldier now looks sterner then of long; Rage in his Eyes, fell outrage on his Tongue, Iron on his back, Steel in his hand: and fell Erynnis makes in Yvry Fields her Hell. There's nothing heard but Drums, Fifes, Trumpets noise, But sharp-shril neighs, but dreadfull Tempests voyce. Terror and Horror over all are spred; Horror's there lovely, and there sweet is Dread: Already fight they with their voyce and gest: Already Horsemen couch their staves in rest; Much like a Lion, meeting hand to hand, Som savage Bull, vpon the Desert sand; Th'one, with wide nostrils, foming wrathfull heat, With lowd proud bellowes, with a thundrous threat Defies his Foe; tosses his head on high, Wounds with his hooves the Earth, with horns the sky: Th'other, as furious, from as fiery Throat Roaring, replyes him with more hideous note; Vnder his horrid Front, in ghastly-wise He roules the Brands of his fierce-flashing Eyes; Rearing his Crest, hee rears his courage stout, And whets his Rage, whisking his train about. The Canon's prim'd, discharg'd, hand-strokes begin: Friends, fellows, neighbours, brothers, cosins, kin, Lose all respects; save only where they may, Deep, deadly Wounds, worthy their Rage, repay. But, North-west winde, vnder the weeping Kid, Never so thick his volleys racqueted, Of bounding Bals of Ice-pearl slippery shining, On those high Hils my Gascony confining, As heer rain Bodies, heer haile lumps of Lead, Making a flood of Blood; a mount of Dead. Torn Limbs, tost Truncheons, Shivers, Fire, and Smoak, As with thick clowds, both Armies round be-cloak: Th'Earth quakes for fear, the Aire recoyleth quick, And Pluto's selfe seems to look pale and sick. This Side advances now, and now retreats: That, lost but now; and now the better gets. For, yet (Ioves issue) Victory (begert With Sword by-side, and Trump behind, athwart; Her head with Crowns, her hands with Scepters fraught, Her costly Robe with many Conquests wrought, Flourisht with Palms, figur'd with Towns about, Embost with Ensignes, with Assaults set-out) Flyes to and fro, from Camp to Camp she plies, And in her hand she leads triumphant-wise Sweet-rapting Glory, full of cheerfull grace, To either Side shewing her lovely Face. O Sons of Mars! which, which of you this day, As worthy Spouse, shall beare for Bride, away This Beautious Love? Who, by her side shall lie? Who, of her Kiss the balmie Bliss shall try? Thrice happy Hee: Him shall the Kings adore: Him shall the Nobles humbly bow before: Him shall the Vulgar (as a Sea it were) Follow, and flock about: and every-where His famous Face shall set-awork the chiefe Of Pensils, Gravers, Chisels, Moulds: in briefe, Hee shall be Summe of an admired Story; And every Age shall celebrate his glory: His high renowne shall onely bounded be With the World's bounds, and with Eternitie. Thus having said, into their brests she blew No common Heat, but Fits of Fury new: Heer Number wins, there Courage, and there Art: And yet Good fortune fals to Either part: As when the spitefull sullen Earth hath meant War with the Floods, war with the Firmament, Sh'incites, inflames, sets-on, in new-found-Duel, Ice-bearded Boreas, Storm-armd Auster cruell; Floods float vncertain, and the Clowds do vary Whither it pleases Either Blast to carry: Till th'one at last, the other conquering, Become Air's Tyrant, and the Water's King. But, lo My Liege: O Courage! there Hee coms: What Ray of Honour round about him looms! O! what new Beams from his bright Eyes doo glance! O Princely Port! Presagefull Countenance Of Hap at hand! Hee doth not nicely prank In clinquant Pomp (as som of meanest Rank) But arm'd in Steel; that bright abilliment Is his rich Valours sole rich Ornament. Steel was his Cradle, vnder Steel hee dight His Chin with Doun, in Steel begins it white: And yet, by Steel Hee conquers, bravely-bold, Towns, Cities, States, Crowns, Sceptres, Goods and Gold. Yet, void of Mark, Hee doth not hide him quight Amid the Throng: a Plume dread-dancing light Beclowds his Cask, and like a Willow showes, Which, prun'd belowe, close by a River growes; And hath no sooner Heav'ns calm favour lost, But instantly his Tops green Tuff is tost, Now vp, now down, and waves (as please the Winde) Now to, now fro; now forward, now behinde. Thus (to bee known) Invincible by Force, Hee, with six hundred, charg'd six thousand Horse. The first that felt his Arm and Fauchin keen, Was, blindely-bold, a Warriour that did ween Himself as stout, as strong; as strong, as great; And, daring so, vndanted Henry met; Who offers prest his Pistoll in his Face, Which would not off, although it fier'd a space. Whence somwhat mov'd, with angry voice, quoth Hee, Hence, guile-full Arms: the glittering Sword for Mee: And draws withall; then nimbly tossing light The flashing Horror of his Fauchin bright (Like an Autumnall ruddy-streaming Star Presaging Famine, Pestilence and War) Copes with his Foe, th'Assailant hee assaults, And resolute observes his Arms defaults: At last, betwixt his Brest-plate and his Bases, Seeks for his Soule, there findes, and thence it chases. Go, happy Soule, go tell the newes beneath, How thou wert honour'd, to have had thy death By th'onely hand of th'Hercules of France, Th'invincible (for, such a Death, perchance, Shall more extoll thy famous Memory, Then to have won som other Victory): Say, heer revives a Martel, Foes to maul; And that Orlando rules again in Gaul. But, Thou go'st not alone: this deadly Fray Thou but beginn'st, as Prologue of his Play. Hee deales about as many Deaths as Blowes: Hee hacks, heaws, hurts all; all hee overthrowes, Swifter then Wind, or Cannon-shot, or Thunder, Trees, towns, and towers, turns vp, beats down, brings vnder. One place, one push, one deed, one death, one wound, Cannot suffice, nor his brave fury bound: He layes on All; and fiery-fierce, and stout, A hundred waies cross-carves the Field about; All fall, in fine, but fall not all alike: Som did he thrill, som thwart, som down-right strike. But, as a Lion in Numidian Field, Feeding awhile on trembling Heards that yeeld; If so he heare a Bears noyse neer about, Rearing his Eares and Crest, he roareth-out; Leaves Lambs, Kids, Kine; glad he incountred hath And Obiect worthier of his noble Wrath: My match-less Prince, discrying Duke De Mayne, Spares vulgar blood, and speeds to Him amain; Through thickest troops of stoutest men at-arms, Through horse and foot, through shot, pikes, Ensignes, Arms, Incounters Him: on Him his load he layes; And round about on every side assayes, Vnder his arms, to seek in every part The heart which only gaue the Leaguers hart. But, dreading his disdain, De-Mayne with-drew: And all his Hopes, so sudden dasht, did rew: Blusht at his past Bliss, full of carefull toyle, Loathing the Field, new witness of his Foile. Now Yvry out of sight, he Mante approches: His weary horse, his weary rowell broches, Vntill, broak-winded, crest-faln, sweaty-swelted, And all his grease in and without him melted, Lolling his ears, hanging his head and neck, For spur he stirs no more, then stock or stick. O, noble Duke! O wherefore flyest Thou? What Panik Terror daunts thy Valour now? Thy constant Face what paints with pale Affright? Alas! thou lack'st not Courage heer, but Right. The Cause confounds thee: Charles, yet stay &amp; stand To Henry's mercy; humbly kiss his hand. If red Revenge, for thy dead Brethrens chance, Made thee take Arms: what's that (alas!) to France? What, to This King? whose heart and hands are knowne From both their Bloods as cleer as are thine Owne. If't were Ambition, mought'st thou not expect From Him, that knowes how Vertue to respect, And can, as King, magnifikly advance His faithfull Servants, and the Friends of France, More Honor and Reward, then from the rude Poore, giddie, gross, ingratefull Multitude; Of many Heads, of more then many Mindes, Leaking in every Storm, led with all Windes; Who pay with Death, or Exile (at the best) Their Dions, Phocions, Camils, and the rest: Whose Rule is Rage; Who (Ivie-like) in time Decay the Tower whereby themselves did clime? If it were Feare to finde His favours gate Now barr'd too-fast for thee to enter at; O! was there ever known more gracious King, Forgetting Ill-turnes; Good remembering! He rather would, by Benefits, then Blowes, Reduce his Rebels. When his Fury glowes, 'Tis but as Straw-fire: while he strikes, he sighes; And (for the most part) from his Enemies Drawes not more blood, then tender Tears withall From his owne Eyes: His Spirit's voyd of Gall (Peculiar Gift, hereditary Grace, The Heav'ns haue given vnto the Borbons Race): And never did the all-discerning Sun, Which daily once about the World doth run, Behold a Prince religiously more loth To shake, for ought, his Honor-binding Oath. Offer my Liege the Germain Emperie, Spaine's Diadem, the Turks Grand-Signorie, Yea, make Him Monarch of the World, by wile; Hee'll spurn all Sceptres, yer his faith he file. But, 'tis (saist Thou) for the Faith Catholike. Why? who Commands in matters Politike? Who in his Camp? but such as more then Thou With Tooth and Naile, Romes Vatican avow? Serves not his Name for Refuge, every-where Securing Priesthood from all Force and Fear? No Athëism, Hee, nor Superstition sents: Hee's a right Christian and religious Prince. He firm beleeves, that God's reformed Aw, He from his Cradle, with his milk did draw: Yet, is not partiall, nor preiudicate. And, if the Church, now neerly ruinate, By our profane hands, our strife-stirring Quills, May ever look for a Redress of Ills; If it may ever hope to reprocure A holy and a happy Peace, to dure; It shall be, doubtless, vnder such a Prince, So free from Passions blinded Vehemence. Back to the Battell, Muse, now cast about: Ah! there they flee; there all are in a Rout: All's full of Horror, full of Ruth and Fear, Full of Disorder, and Confusion, there: There, none obey; there, none at all command; There, every Souldier makes apart his Band. The ample Plain is couerd all about With casks, swords, muskets, pikes; and the most stout To darkest Groves carry their Deaths conceived, In deepest Holes bury their Deaths received. The Victor follows, over-takes anon; Fears not the way the Flyers fear'd t'have gone. The most hee fears, is, left Som's shift-full fear, Other's despair, finde out for safety there, Som Flat, som Foord, som Bank, som Bridge, som Way, To passe the Eure: but, pressed with Dismay, All, breath-less, panting in a desperate haste, Them heer and there into the River cast. Th'immortall Nymph Navonda, azure-ey'd, Queen of that Crystall, and that Currents Guide; Scar'd with their noise, above the water pushes Her dropping Head, in Caul of weeping Rushes, O! whence, quoth shee, whence coms this iron spawn? These Metall-Men? From what mount Cibel drawn? What Vulcan gave, what Myron lent (I pray) Steel life, to stir; to Iron, breath, to neigh? Hence, Monsters, hence (Wars dreadfull workmanship): With bloody deaws your Mother-Earth be-dip; And let vs gently, without stop or stain, To meet our Tritons, roule into the Main. Her voice doth vanish in so various noise: This, with his Owne; that, with his Armors poiz, Sinks instantly: Som have, in stead of Graves, Nought but their Steeds; their Steeds, no Toombs but Waves: Som, more dismaid, for Skiff their Targets take; For Oars, their Arms; their Sail, their Plumes they make: But, greedy Whirl-pools, ever-wheeling round, Suck-in, at-once, Oars, Sails and Ships, to ground. Those that, by chance, scape to the other Shore, Changing their place, change not their case the more. Dikes, Bridges broken, Cities, Rampires cast, Cannot secure their more then headlong Haste. Did any Squadrons dare thy Conquest cross, They but increast Thine Honour, and their Loss. Witnes the Band of Spanish Belgian Foes, Vnder three Ensignes marching strongly close; Whom, Thou, the fifteenth, chargest; beatest down That mighty Body, sudden overthrown; Even as a Galley, in smooth Sea subdues The tallest Ship that in The Straights doth vse: Or as a Iennet in his nimble Speed Oft over-turns the strongest German Steed. Thou heaw'st, beat'st, breakest down: Thou conquerst ay, Till dusky Night have robd thee quite of Day; And Death, of Foes. Th'Helvetian Bands alone, Loth to disgrace their ancient Valor known, Against the Victor their steel Staves address, As most Courageous in the most distress: But, soon the Lightning of thy Martiall eyes Their Diamantine hearts dissolves to Ice; That Ice to Water, That to Vapour vain: And Those whom Death rather then Fear could strain, Those, those that never turnd their backs at all, But to Wars-Phœnix, Conquerer of Gaul, Those King-correcting, Tyrant-scourging Braves, Cast at thy feet their Bodies and their Staves. Thou, then, as loth perpetually to brand People so loyall to the Lillies Land, Calming the rage of thy iust hearts disdain, Their Colours to their Comets giv'st again. O! proudest Trophey, which all Tropheys passes! O Browes, whom Bayes eternall tress imbraces! Invincible! O more then Royall Brest, Who, of Thy Selfe, and Triumph, triumphest! Who pleasest All: with Victory thine Host, Thy Foes with Grace: Both with thy Glory, most. Earth's Ornament, Thou Honor of our Times, Ay on the wings of mine Heroïk Rimes, So brave Exploit be bravely born about: May all our Commons (commonly too-stout) Who bred in braules, in Broils, and Insolence, Stood, as at gaze, distracted in suspence, Expecting th'Issue of This dreadfull Fight, Make their due profit, and apply it right. May now the Nobles freely grant, for true, That the World's Empire to Thy Worth is due: That, now they have Wise happy Prince for head: That by This Battail Thou hast rendered To Them their Rank, reveng'd the King deceast, Restor'd the State, and captive France releast. May now the Clergie ingenuously confess, God on Thy Side, giving Thy Right Success; Crowning Thy Vertues, and with sacred Oyle Of his owne Spirit anoynting Thee the while. May now (in briefe) All Frenchmen say and sing, Thou art, Thou ought'st, Thou only canst be King. But, O! som Gangrene, Plague, or Leprosie, O're-spreads vs all: a Brand of Mutinie Burnes France to Ashes. And but Thou (vnidle) Bear'st-vp so hard this stumbling Kingdoms Bridle; Our state (yerst honor'd where the Sun doth rise) Would flie in Sparks, or die in Atomies. Priests strike the Fire, the Nobles blow the Coale Of this Consumption: People (peevish whole) Pleas'd with the Blaze, do, wretched-witched Elves, For fuell (fooles) cast-in their willing Selves. O Clergie (mindless of your Cure and Coat) Becoms it You to cut your Princes throat? To kill your King? Who, in the Wombe (of kin To Thousand Kings) that Office did begin: Who, for Your Law, Your Altars, and Your Honors, Hath ventur'd oft his blood in many manners: Who, as devout to Rome, as any Man, Fear'd most your roaring Buls of Vatican: And canonize amid the sacred Roule Of glorious Saints a Parricidiall Soule, Whose bloody hand had stabd with banefull knife The Lords Anoynted, and Him rest of life? Ignoble Nobles see You not (alas!) Your King supplanting, you your Selves abass? And, while you raze this Royall Monarchie, You madly raise a monstrous Anarchie, A Chaos rude, still whetting, day and night, Against your Selves, the Peoples proud Despite; Who hate the the Vertuous, and have onely Hope T'ensue the Switzers too-rebellios Scope? And Thou fond People, Who (before a Father, A wise, iust King; a valiant Monarch) rather Tak'st hundred Tyrants: who, with tushes fell, Will suck thy marrow out, and crack thy shell: To whom the Gold, from India's bowels brought, Or mid the Sands of shining Tagus sought, Seems not so good, as doth the Gold they fet From out thy Womb, or what thy Tears shall wet. No, no: the French, or Deafe, or Lethargik, Feele not their danger, though thus deadly Sick: Or, if they liue and feele; they, frantik, arm Against their Leach that fain would cure their harm, Applying many sound-sweet Medcines fit: But They the more increase their furious Fit. Yet, Courage Henry, fix thy Thoughts heeron, Pursue (brave Prince) thy Cure so well begun: And sith so little, gentle Plaisters thrive, Let it be lanç't, lay-on the Corrosive: Choke me This Hydra whence such Monsters sprout, And with thy Fame fill me the World about. Follow thy Fortune: Hills most lofty-browd, Stoop to thy Steps; swift Rivers, swelling proud, Dry-vp before thee: Armies, full of Boast, Like Vapors vanish at Thy sight, almost. Yea, at thy Name alone, the strongest Wall, And massiest Towrs shake (as affraid) and fall. But yet, My Liege, beware how Thou expose Thy blood so oft among thy bloody Foes: Be not too-lavish of thy Life; but waigh, That Our Good-hap on Thine dependeth aye. But, if Thou light regard This lowe Request Of Thy Fames Trumpet; lift how France (at least) Presents her to thee: not as Once Shee was (When Baltik Seas, within Her bounds did pass: When Nile and Euphrate, as Her Vnder-Realms, Through fruitfull Plaines roul'd tributary streams: When to proud Spanyards Shee did Kings allow; And to Her Lawes imperiall Rome did bow) But, lean and lank, bleak, weak, and all too-torn, And in a Gulf of Miseries forlorn. Deer Son (saith Shee) nay, My Defender rather, My Staff, my Stay, my second-founding Father; For Grief, and Furie, I should desperate die, I should Selfe stab-me, I should shamefully Stop mine owne breath, to stint these Cares of mine, Wert Thou not Mine (my Liege) were I not Thine. Therefore, dear Spouse, be of thy Life less lavish; Let not, My Lord, Fames greedy Thirst so ravish Thy dantless Courage into Dangers need-less, Nor, too-too-hardy hazard Thee so heed-less. A brave, great Monarch in Youths heat behooves, Once, twice, or thrice, to shew Courageous prooves: For Prowess is bright Honors bravest Gate; Yea, the first Step, whereby the Fortunate Climbe Glorie's Mount: and nothing more (in briefe) Fires Souldiers Valor, then a Valiant Chiefe. But, afterward, hee must more warie war; And, with his Wit, ofter then Weapon, far: His spirits contenting with the pleasing-pain, Not of a Souldier, but a Soverain. My Son, too-often hath thine owne hand dealt Too-many Blowes, which thousands yerst have felt: My Liege, too-often hast Thou toyled Thee For Honors Prize: brave Prince, My Victory Not in thine Arms strength, but thy Yeers length lies; Thy Life, my Life; Thy Death, my Death implies. If Thou, thy Selfe neglect, respect me though, At least som Pitie to thy Countrey showe. Weigh, weigh my sad plight, if vntimely Death Should (O, vntimely!) reave My Henry's breath: Even like a widow-Ship, her Pilot lost, Her Rudder broke, in ragefull Tempest tost Against the horned Rocks, or horrid Banks, Hoaring the Shore with her dispersed Planks. But, if too-much-Heart, of thy life too-careless, Too-soon expose thee not, to Sisters-spareless, I hope to flourish more then e'r in Arts, Wealth, Honors, Manners, Vertues, Valiant hearts, Religion Lawes; and Thy iust Raign (at rest) In Happiness shall match Avgvstvs Best. FINIS. SIMILE NON EST IDEM: Seeming is not the Same. OR All's not Gold that glisters. A Character of this Corrupted Time, Which makes Religion but a Cover-Crime. To the worthily Honored Sir Henry Baker, Knight-Baronet. Tis better late, than never to repay: Better a little, than no Part at all: Take therfore, in good-part, This Part (though smal) Of your great Debt: and pardon my Delay, Till (more mine Owne) with more Respect, I may In better Measure (as I hope, I shall) Answere your Merit; though not answere all Your Bounties Bonds, renewed Day by Day. Yov minde your Maker, in your Dayes of Youth: You shew vs, by your Works, your Faith's sincerity: You are so friendly to the Friends of Truth, Your vertuous Life so proves your Love to Veritle, That None I thought, could, with more patient Eye, Abide to look on this ANATOMIE. Your Vertues Humble Honorer, Iosvah Sylvester. SIMILE NON EST IDEM: Seeming is not the-Same. OR All's not Gold that glisters. 1 How TIMES are chang'd! and Wee with Times, In new, nefarious, various Crimes! Exceeding all that haue preceeded, In Pride, in Fraud, in Filth, in Force, Rape, Treason, Poyson, past Remorse: Such, as (in Time) will scarce be creeded. 2 O Mindes! O manners, most absurd! When (to the Scandall of The Word) The more our Light, the worse our Works: When seeming Saincts be nothing less; And more Profane, who most Profess, Than Infidells, or Iewes, or Turks. 3 And when, between our roaring Giants, That openly, bid Heav'n Defiance, Heaping-vp Hills of wickedness; And th'vndermining close despights Of double-hearted Hypocrites, Masking in Hollow-Holiness. 4 From Earth are Faith and Trvth exil'd; False Error hath all Hearts beguil'd: All-over All Abvses raigne. Vertue is Vice; Vice Vertue growen, Iustice is iustled from her Owne: Honor and Right are in disdaigne. 5 'Tis, To be Foolish, To be Wise: With Reason, is Against the Guise: Read they that can My Riddle right. Christ, Sonne of Man; and God of Hoasts, How-many of Thy Baptisme boasts, Whose life doth to the death defie't! 6 For, Thy Disciples Thee beleeue; And in Thee onely double-live; According to Thy Gospel's veritie: But, dare We say, that We are such; When now-adayes in Poore or Rich, Is found nor Faith, nor Hope, nor Charitie? 7 God hath engraven in every Soule A native Law, on Natures Roule; Whereby (alas) Westand convict: And Precedents of pious Zeal, Who by their Bloods, their Hopes did seal, To double Death condemne vs, strict. 8 We ought in fringe That Statute never, From everlasting firm'd for-ever: Doo, as Thou would'st be done vnto: Doo not, what Thou would'st not accept, O pure, plain, gentle, iust Precept! Yet This (alas!) Who looks to doe, 9 When all Degrees so tender bin Towards them Selves, without, with-in, They, neither Wrong, nor Right, can suffer? But towards Others (made as They, By the same hand, of the same Clay) Against all Rights, all Wrongs doo offer. 10 LORD, Thou hast said, and shew'n it cleer (When in thy Flesh, Thou soiourn'dst heer) Thy Kingdome is not of This World: So shall I evermore suspect, While heer I see, with such neglect, Thy Holy Statutes after-hurld. 11 All those (O Lord) that cry, Lord, Lord; With Shadow of thy Sacred Word, To cloak their Wickedness, with-in; Are none of Thine: but of Thy Name Profanely make a mocking-Game, To countenance their cursed Sin. 12 Like that Ignatian-Latian Colledge, Where, vnder Shew of Sacred Knowledge, They study State and Stratagems; Making a staple-Trafick of it (After their Pleasure, or their Profit) To murder Kings, and mangle Realms: 13 Thee Iesvs (Mercifull and Meek) They make a Tyrant (Nero-like) Bloody and brute, to kill and quell: Thee, Saviovr, Source of Innocence; Thee, Prince of Peace and Patience; They make a Fury, fierce and fell, 14 Thee, Iustice-Fountaine, Order's Author, They make Wrong's Fort, Confusions Fautor: Immortall Spring immaculate Of Love, of Concord, and of Vnion, They make Thee Trumpet of Dis-Vnion, And Tinder of immortall Hate. 15 Such Canons roare from Trent and Tiber, From Powder Traitors bloody Briber, Whose Holiness, is Hollowness; Whose Synagogue, is Sinners Wrack; Whose Fauh, is Favx and Ravailliac; Whose Deeds and Doctrine, Wickedness. 16 O, where is then The Holy Flock! Call'd in one Hope, built on one Rock, Into one Faith incorporing; Thorough one Baptisme, by one Word, Vnder one Father (God and Lord) One onely Prophet, Priest and King. 17 There, there (as Children of one Mother) They succour and support each other, In Vniou, and in mutuall Charitie; All making but one Body, being All of One Minde, in One agreeing: Bound by One Bond of Peace, and Veritie. 18 O, can We (wretched, witched Elves) Can We, We Many, boast our Selves One Bread, one Bodie (mystick-wise); And say that We are daily fed In common with one Drink and Bread, Amid our many Enmities? 19 Alas! Where are those Saincts become, Worthy the style of Christendome; From Sin's Dominion inly freed; Vessels of Honor, full of Grace, Abounding in good-works apace? None now good Thought hath; less good Deed. 20 Nothing but false Eqvivocation: Nothing but wilfull Obduration: Nothing but Error and Disorder: Nothing but Pride and Insolence: Nothing but impious Impudence: Nothing but Treason, Theft, and Murder. 21 Contempt of God and of all Good, Rape, Riot, Incest, Bribery, Blood, Periury, Plotting, all Impiety, With more then brutest Brutishness, This more-than-Iron-Age posess: No Loue, no Friendship, no Societie. 22 Court, Citie, Countrey, Every Sort Of either Sex, make Sin a Sport (Pride, Painting, Poys'ning, Cous'ning, Whoring); In Sloth, or Surfeit, ever-drown'd; To Bacchus, or Tobacco bound; With swearing, staring, stabbing, roaring. 23 Wrath, Envie, Slander, and suspicion, Fraud, Rancour, Rapine, and Ambition, With Blasphemies, all over-spread: Th'old Christians Badge, bright Charitie (Most frequent then; Now Raritie) Is, now-adayes, not down, but Dead. 24 We are so Punctuall and Precise In Doctrine (Pharisaik-wise) To seem (at least) the most Religiovs, That true RELIGION we deforme, While to our Phant'sies we reforme Shadowes, and not our Selues, litigious. 25 RELIGION! O, Thou Life of Life! How Worldlings, that profane thee rife, Can wrest thee to their Appetites! How Princes, who Thy Power defie, Pretend thee, for their Tyranny; And People, for their false Delights! 26 Vnder Thy sacred Name, all-over, All Vicious all their Vices Cover: The Violent, their Violence: The Proud, their Pride: the False, their Fraud: The Theefe, his Theft: her Filth, the Baud: The Impudent, their Impudence. 27 Ambition, vnder Thee, aspires: Avarice, vnder Thee, desires: Sloath, vnder Thee, her Ease assumes: Lux', vnder Thee, all over-flowes: Wrath, vnder Thee, outrageous growes: All Evill, vnder Thee, presumes. 28 RELIGION, yerst so venerable, Th'art now-adayes but made a Fable; A holy Maske on Follies Browe, Where-vnder lyes Dissimulation, Lined with all Abhomination: Sacred RELIGION, Where art Thou? 29 Not in the Church, with Simonie: Nor on the Bench, with Briberie: Nor in the Court with Machiauell: Nor in the Citie, with Deceits: Nor in the Countrey, with Debates: For, What hath Heaven to doe with Hell? 30 Sith whatsoever Showe we make (For Profit or Promotions sake) What-ever Colour we put-on; Where, Faith no other Fruits affords, But evill-works (though civill words) Indeed is no RELIGION. 31 Reverend RELIGION, Where's the heart That entertaines thee as thou art, Sincerely, for Thine owne respect? Where is the Minde, Where is the Man, May right be call'd a Christian; Not formall, but in true effect? 32 Who, fixing all his Faith and Hope On God alone, from sacred Scope Of his pure Statutes will not stray: Who comes in Zeale and Humbleness, With true and hearty Singleness, Willing to walke the perfect Way: 33 Who loves, with all his Soule and Minde, Almighty God, All-Wise, All-kinde, All-whole, All-Holy, All-sufficing: Who but One onely God adores (Though Tyrants rage, and Satan rores) Without digressing, or disguising: 34 Who God's due Honour hath not given To Other things, in Earth or Heaven; But bow'd and vow'd to Him alone; Him onely serv'd with filiall Aw, Pleas'd and delighted in his Law, Discoursing Day and Night thereon; 35 Not, not for Forme, or Fashion sake; Or, for a Time, a Showe to make, Others the better to beguile: Nor it, in Iest, to wrest or cite; But in his heart it deep to write, And work it with his hands the-while; 36 Loving his neighbour as him-selfe, Sharing to him his Power, his Pelfe, His Counsails, Comforts, Coats, and Cates: Dooing in all things to his Brother, But as Him-selfe would wish from Other, Not Offring Other what He hates: 37 Whose Heart, inclin'd as doth behove-it, Vnlawfully doth Nothing covet (To Any an offence to offer): But, iust and gentle towards all, Would rather (vnto great, or small) Then doe one Wrong, an hundred suffer: 38 Not thirsting Others Land, or Life; Nor neighing after Maid or Wife; Nor ayming any Iniury; Neither of polling, nor of pilling, Neither of cursing, nor of killing, Neither of Fraud, nor Forgerie; 39 But will confess, if hee offend, Relent, Repent, and soon amend, And timely render Satisfaction. Sure, His RELIGION is not fained, Who doth and hath him Thus demeaned; Ay deadly hating Evill-action. 40 Therefore, O! Vassals of the Divell, That cannot, will not, cease from Evill, Vessels of Wrath and Reprobation; Presume no longer Now to shrowd Vnder RELIGION's sacred Clowd Your Manifold Abhomination. 41 If, But to seem good, goodly seem; To begood, better farre esteem: Why seem you what to be you care not? If To Seem evill, be amiss; Sure, To be evill, worse it is: Why be you what To seem you dare not? Be, as you seem; or seem the Same You be: to free RELIGION's Blame. FINIS. A GLIMSE OF HEAVENLY IOYES: OR NEW-HIERVSALEM. In an old Hymne extracted from the most Divine S?. Avgvstine. To the Worthy Friend of Worthiness, S?. Peter Manvvood, K. of the Hon??. Order of the Bath. To register, to After-Times, Your noble Favour to My Rimes; Your love to Vertue, Learning, Arts; Your Bounty towards Worthie Parts; Your Pitie; and your pious Zeale To GOD, to Church, to Common-weale; Your Loyalty, in every kinde; The Honour of Your Humble Minde: All, all my MANWOOD to rehearse, Merits a Volume, not a Verse. But, poore diuided I (that owe, To many, Much, as many knowe; And faine would giue Content to Each, So far forth as my Stock will reach) Vnable (after your Desart) To renacr All, must tender Part, To testifie my Thankfull-Thought, (But as I could; not as I ought) And what my Weakness cannot pay, Th'AL-MIGHTIE-most I humbly pray To guerdon with a Diadem, Within His NEW-IERVSALEM. Yours much Obliged, Iosvah Sylvester. NEW-HIERVSALEM. My Heart (as Hart for Water) thirsts For Life's eternall Fount: My Soule, my Bodies Prisoner, longs, From Prison free, to mount; Sighes, sues, pursues, poor exile here, Her Countrey to recover; Too-abiect, subiect to Disgrace, And too-too-triumpht-over. Shee seems to see the Glory now, Which, when she sinn'd, shee lost: An instant Ill, of Good for-gone Augments the Memory most. But, of celestiall Soverain Bliss, Who can set-forth the Solace! Where stands, of ever-living Stones, An ever-lasting Palace; The lofty Roofes and stately Roomes, Reflecting golden beames: The Gates and goodly Walls about, Of rich and orient Gemms: The Streets, all pav'd with purest Gold, As smooth as any Glass-is: No Foile, no Soile, no Sorrow there; No Sicknesse thither passes. No Winter's Frost, no Summer's Toast, Doth there Distemper bring: But, Flowers, perpetuall flowring there, Make there perpetuall Spring. There, Balsam, Saffron, Lilly, Rose, Doe sweat, sent, shine, and blush: There, Mead, &amp; Field, spring, spire, &amp; yeeld; Rills, Milke and Hony gush: There Aromaticks breath-about Their odoriferous Aire: There, ever dangle dainty Fruits On Trees still blooming faire: There, never Moon doth wax or wane, Nor Sun, nor Stars decline; But There, the Lamb (the Light of Lights) Eternally doth shine. There, Time hath no alternate Term; No Night, but ever Day; For, There, the Saincts are (as the Sun) Most Bright, in white Aray; Triumphant; after Conquest, crow'nd, In mutuall Ioy they greet; Recounting safe the Battels fought, Their Foes now vnder-feet; Pure, purifi'd from dregs and dross; From fleshly Combats freed: Their Flesh, made spirituall, with the Spirit, In One self-same agreed: In perfect and perpetuall Peace; Subiect no more to sinning: Obnoxious nor to Change, nor Chance Return'd to their Beginning: And Face to Face for ever see All Beauties Glory bright, Possessing sempiternall Ioyes, In that supernall Sight (The Sight of God, the Soverain Good, The Sun of Happiness, Such as no heart can heer comprise, Nor any Art express.) Installed in a Bliss full State Of Glory, still The same; As sure, as pure, from Faile or Fall, From Sorrow, Sin, and Shame. All ioyous, lively, lovely, bright, To no Mis-hap exposed: No Danger, Death, Disease, nor Age; In Health and Youth reposed. Henceforth, for all Eternity, They flourish fresh and green: For, Death is dead, Time termined, Corruption conquer'd cleen. Now know they Him, that knoweth All. And in beholding Him They All behold (as in a Glass) Before them bright and brim. In Vnity of minde combin'd, One very thing they Will; And ever Constant, never cross, One and the same they Nill. As heer in Grace, in Glory there, Though diversly, they shine: Loue equall's All; Each louing All With mutuall Love divine, So that the Good of Every-one Becoms of all the Good. Where is the Body, thither right Right Eagle-shoales doe scud; Where-with, with Angels, Saincted-soules Are aye refresht and fed (For, Either Countrie's Burgesses Are nourisht with One Bread) And ever fain, though ever full; Wishing but What they have: Not sated with Satietie; Nor needing more to crave: Desiring still, their fill they eate; And eating, still desire. Still new melodious Songs they sound With Heav'ns harmonious Quire; And Organs Worthy (for His Worth Through Whom they over-came) Sing Holy, Holy, Holy, Praise To His most Holy Name. O happy, happy, happy, Soules, That see Heav'ns King, above; And vnderneath-them Sun and Moon, And all the World to moove! O Christ, victorious Lord of Hoasts, So lead my Soule and Heart, That, having fought, as heer I ought, I may have there a Part Among that Blessed Hierarchie, In Happiness supreme, A free and fellow-Citizen Of Nevv-Iervsalem. Vouchsafe me Grace, to run my Race, And strenuously to strive Vnto the End, that in the End I may the Crowne atchive: Not for My Work, but for Thy Worth; Thy Mercy, not My Merit: So Laud and Prayse be sung alwaies To Father, Sonne, and Spirit.

Translated; and Dedicated To the truely-Honorable M??. Cecilie Nevil. Anagramma Italiano. Cecilia Nevila. E Vicina al Cul. Heav'ns Neighbour is your Anagram Your Noble Graces prove the same. [Fair Heir of All Your Mothers Good] Fair Heir of All Your Mothers Good (Wit, Vertue, Beauty, Bounty, Blood) Among the Honors that accrue, By Her Decease divolv'd to You, Mine humble Service and This Song (How little) doth not least belong (In Little lies a mickle Right; As in a Million, in a Mite) To her Memoriall, and Your Merit, True Mirror of Minerva's Spirit. Accept it therefore, double Yours; By Her Donation, and by Ours, Humbly devoted, (as most-bound) To Both Your Noble Families, Iosvah Sylvester. TO THE RIGHT NOBLE, Vertuous and Learned Lady, the Lady Mary Nevil. Maria Nevila. Alia Minerva. Madame, Your love to Learning, and the Learned (In such a time so full of Arts neglect) Right worthily to Your rare Self hath earned The Love of Learning, and the learned Sect: Whereby, Your Name already is eterned In Memory's fair Temple, high erect: And there devoutly at Your Vertues Shrine, I humbly offer this poor Mite of Mine; Too small a Present to so great a Grace; And too-vnworthy of Your Worthinesse: Save that the Matter so exceeds the Masse, That oft (perhaps) a greater may bee lesse. For, You may see, within This little Glasse, The Little-World's great-little-Mindednes: Man's strife with Man; Our Flesh and Spirit in Duel: Courageous Cowards, too-self-kindely-cruell. Vouchsafe t'accept then This small New-yeers-Gift, With humble Vowes of a disastred Muse, Which lavishly hath sowne her Seeds of Thrift So high and dry, that yet no Fruit ensues. Else need Shee not have made so hard a Shift; Nor this small Gift so greatly to excuse. But sith, as yet, Shee cannot what Shee would; Madame, accept her Zeal, and what Shee could. To Your Honorable Vertues, most devoted, Iosvah Sylvester. AVTO-MACHIA: OR Self-Civil-War. I sing not Priam, nor the Siege of Troy: Nor Agamemnon's Iarr with Thetis ioy: I sing not heer Æneas stormfull Fate; Queen Dido's love, nor Goddess Iuno's hate: I sing not Cæsar, nor his Son-in-law; Whose Civill Rage Rome and Pharsalia saw. I sing my Self; my Civill-Wars within; The Victories I hourly lose and win; The daily Duel, the continuall Strife, The War that ends not, till I end my life. And yet, not Mine alone, not onely Mine; But every-One's, that vnder th'honour'd Signe Of Christ his Standard shall his Name enroule, With holy vows of Body and of Soule. Vouchsafe, O Father, succour from above; Courage of Soule, comfort of Heav'nly Love: Triumphant Captaine, Glorious General, Furnish me Armes from thine own Arcenall: O Sacred Spirit, My spirit's assistant bee; And in This Conflict, make Mee conquer Mee. VERTVE I loue, I leane to Vice: I blame This wicked World, yet I imbrace the same. I climb to Heav'n, I cleaue to Earth: I both Too-loue my Self, and yet my Self I loath. Peace-less, I Peace pursue; in Ciuil War, With and against my Self, I ioyne, I iarr: I burn, I freeze; I fall downe, I stand fast: Well-ill I fare; I glory, though disgraç't: I die aliue: I triumph, put to flight; I feed on Cares, in Teares I take delight: My Slaue (base-braue) I serue; I roame at large, In libertie, yet lie in Gaolers Charge: I strike, and stroak my Self: I, kindly-keen, Work mine own Woe, rub my Gal, rouz my Spleen. Oft, in my Sleep, to see rare Dreams I dreame; Waking, mine Eye doth scarce discerne a Beame. My Minde's strange Megrim, whirling to and fro, Now thrusts mee hither, thither then doth throwe. In divers Factions I my Self divide; And All I try, and fly to every Side. What I but now desir'd, I now disdain: What (late) I waigh'd not, now I wish again: To-Day, to-Morrow; This, That, Now, Anon, All, Nothing, crave I; Ever Never-one. Dull Combatant, vnready for the Field, Too-tardy take I (after wounds) my Shield. Still hurried headlong to vnlawfull things, Down-dragging Vice Mee eas'ly down-ward dings: But, sacred Vertue climbs so hard and hy, That hardly can I her steep steps discry. Both Right and Wrong with Mee indifferent are: My Lust is Law: what I desire, I dare. (Is there so foul a Fault, so fond a Fact, Which, Folly asking, Fury dares not act?) But, art-less, heart-less, in Religion's Cause (To doo her Lessons, and defend her Lawes) The All-proof Armour of My God I lose, Flee from my Charge, and yeeld it to his Foes. Guilty of Sin, Sin's Punishment I shun, But not the Guilt, before th'Offence bee don (For, How could shunning of a Sin, ensew To bee occasion of another New?) Oft and again at the same stone I trip, As if I learn'd, by falling, not to slip. Alive I perish, and my Self vndoo; Mine eyes (Self-wise) Witting and Willing too. Sick, to my Self I run for my Relief; So, Sicker of my Physick than my Grief: For, while I seek my swelting Thirst to swage, Another Thirst more ragingly doth rage: While, burnt to death, to cool mee I desire; With Flames, my Flames; with Sulphur, quench I Fire: While that I strive my swelling Waves to stop, More stormily they toss above my top. Thus am I cur'd, This is my common Ease; My Med'cine still worse than my worst Disease: My Sores with Sores, my Wounds with Wounds, I heal, While to my Self, my Self I still conceal. O what leud Leagues! what Truces make I still With Sin, with Satan, and my wanton Will! What slight occasions doo I take to sin! What silly Trains am I intrapped in! What idle Cloaks for Crimes! what Nets to hide Notorious Sins, already long descri'd! I write in Ice (Windes Witnes, sign'd with Showrs) I will redeem my foul Life's former hours: But, soon the swinge of Custom (Whirl-winde-like) Rapting my Passion (ever Fashion-sick) Transports Mee to the Contrary; alone, Faint Guard of Goodnes; Arm-less Champion. My Green-sick Taste doth nothing sweeter finde Than what is bitter to a gracious Minde: Egypt's fat Flesh-pots I am longing-for: Th'eternall Manna I doo even abhorre. World's Monarch Mammon (dropsie mysticall) Crown'd round-faç't Goddess, coined belial: Midas's Desire, the Miser's onely Trust; The sacred hunger of Pactolian Dust, Gold, Gold bewitches mee, and frets accurst My greedy Throat with more than Dipsian Thirst. My minde's a Gulf, whose Gaping Nought can stuff; My heart a Hell, that never hath enough: The more I have I crave, and less content; In Store, most Poor, in Plenty, Indigent. For, of these Cates how-much so-e'r I cram, It doth not stop my Mouth, but stretch the same. Sweet Vsurie's Incestuous Interest, For Dallers, Dolours hoordeth in my Chest. The World's Slave, Profit, and the Minde's Slut, Pleasure Insatiate Both, Both bound-less, Both past measure: This Cleopatra, That Sardanapale) For huge Annoies, bring Ioyes but short and small. O Miracle! begot by Heav'n, in Earth (My Minde divine, My Body brute by Birth) O! what a Monster am I, to depaint! Half-Friend, half-Fiend, half-Savage, half a Saint; High'r than my Fire doth my gross Earth aspire: My raging Flesh my retch-less Force doth tire, And (drunk with Worlds-Must, and deep sunk in Sleep) My Spirit (the Spy, that wary Watch should keep) Betraies, alas! (Wo that I trust it so) My Soule's dear Kingdom to her deadly Fo. Through Cares Charybdis, and through Gulfs of Grief, Star-lar-boord run I, Sailing all my Life On merry-sorry Seas; my Winde, my Will; My Ship, my Flesh; my Sense, my Pilot still. As in a most seditious Common-weal, Within my Brest I feel my Best rebell: Against their Prince my furious People rise; Their Aw-less Prince dares his owne Law despise. Mine Eve's an Out-law: And my struggling Twins, Iacob and Esau, never can bee friends: Such deadly feud, such discord, such despight (Even between Brethren) such continuall fight. What's don in Mee, Another doth, not I; Yet both (alas!) my Guest and Enemy: My minde, vnkinde (suborned by my Fo) Indeed, within mee, but not with mee tho; Neer, yet far-off, in fleshly Lees be-soil'd, And with the World's contagious Filth defil'd. I am too-narrow for mine owne Desires; My Self denies mee, what my Self requires: Fearfull I hope: carefull-secure I languish: Hungry too-full; Dry-Drunken; sugred Anguish; Weary of Life, merry in Death; I suck Wine from the Pumice, Hony from the Rock. On Thorns, my Grapes; on Garlick growes my Rose: From Crums my Sums; from Flint my Fountain flowes: In showrs of Tears, mine hours of Fears I mourn: My Looks to Brooks, my Beams to Streams, I turn: Yet, in this Torrent of my Torments rïfe, I sink Annoies, and drink the Ioies of Life. Dim light, brim night, Beams waving cloudy-cleer: Vnstable State, void Hope, vain Help, far-neer: False-true Perswasion, law-less Lawfulness: Confused Method, Milde-wilde War-like Peace: Disordred Order, Mournfull Meriments: Dark Day, Wrong Way, Dull-double Diligence: Infamous Fame, known Error, skil-less Skill: Mad Minde, rude Reason, an vnwilling Will: A healthy Plague, a wealthy Want, poor Treasure: A pleasing Torment, a tormenting Pleasure: An odious Love, an vgly Beauty; base Reproachfull Honour, a disgracefull Grace: A fruit-less Fruit, A dry dis-flowred Flower: A feeble Force, a conquered Conquerour: A sickly Health, dead Life, and rest-less Rest: These are the Comforts of my Soule distrest. O! how I Like, Dis-like, Desire, Disdain; Repell, repeal, loath, and delight again! O! What, Whom, Whether (neither Flesh nor Fish) How, weary of, the same again I wish! I will, I nill; I nill, I will; my Minde Perswading This, my Mood to That inclin'd. My loose Affection (Proteus-like) appears In every Form; at once it frowns and fleers. Mine ill-good Will is vain and variable: My (Hydra) Flesh buds Heads innumerable: My Minde's a Maze; a Labyrinth, my Reason: Mine Ey (false Spy) the Door to Phantsies Treason: My rebell Sense (Self-soothing) still affects What it should flee; What it should ply, neglects: My flitting Hope with Passions Storms is tost But now to Heav'n, anon to Hell almost: Concording Discord kils mee; and again, Discording Concord doth my Life sustain. My Self at once I both displease and please; Without my Self, my Self I fain would seaze: For, my too-much of Mee, Mee much annoies; And my Selfe's Plenty my poor Self destroies: Who seeks Mee in Mee, in Mee shall not finde Mee as my Self: Hermaphrodite in minde, I am (at-once) Male, Female, Neuter: yet What-e'r I am, I am not mine, I weet: I am not with my Self, as I conceive: Wretch that I am, my Self my Self deceive: Vnto my Self, my Self my Self betray: I from my Self, banish my Self away: My Self agrees not with my Self a jot, Knowes not my Self: I have my Self forgot: Against my Self, my Self moove Iarres vnjust: I trust my Self, and I my Self distrust: My Self I follow, and my Self I fly: Besides my Self, and in my Self, am I: My Self am not my Self, another same; Vnlike my Self, and like my Self, I am: Self-fond, Self-furious: and thus, Wayward Elf, I cannot live with, nor without, my Self. FINIS. A CVP OF CONSOLATION for the Christian in his Conflict. Why, silly Man, sick of exceeding Grief, What boots it Thee, vncertain of thy Life, Of thy disease to make so much adoo? Thou coward Souldier, and vntoward too, Away with Fear: defie both Death and Hell: Meet Arms with Arms, and Darts with Darts repell: So, the first On-set, in this furious Fray, Shall towards Heav'n make thee an easie Way; And open wide those Gates so hardly won, Where Snowie-winged Victory doth wun: Thou must bee valiant, and with dant-less brest Rush through the thickest, Run vpon the best Of braving Foes; and, on their Flight and Foil, Reare noble Trophies of triumphant Spoil. For, This World's Prince, dark Limboe's Potentate, Drifts Man's Destruction, and with deadly Hate (Still Strife-full) labours, and by all means seeks To trouble All, and Heav'n with Hell to mix. Great War within ther is, great War without; With Flesh and Blood, and with the World about. On this Side, smiling Hope (with smoothest brow) False-promiseth long Peace and Plenty too: On that Side, sallow Fear (with fainting breath) Checks those proud thoughts with threats of War &amp; Death; And (weary of it Selfe) it Self distrusts, It Self destroyes, and to Confusion thrusts; And ignorant of it Selfe's Good (yer Triall) In jealous Rage it even betraies the loyall. Heer, Cloud-browd Sorrow, Whirl-winde-like, it hies Th'amated Minde to tosse and tyrannize: There, dimpled Ioy nimbly enringeth round Her gawdy Troops that stand vpon no ground; Whose brittle gloss and glory lasts and shines As Stubble-Fire, and Dust before the Windes. What should I speak of all the snarefull Wiles, And cunning Colours of my sterious Guiles, Wherewith Death's Founder, and thy Life's drad Fo, Improvident Mankinde doth overthrowe? Yet, bee Courageous, yeeld not vnto Evill: Resist Beginnings, and defie the Divell. For sure Defence amid these fell Alarms, Quick buckle-on these ay-victorious Arms: First, gird thy Loins with Truth, thy Bosom dress In the sure Brest-plate of pure Righteousnes: Put, on thy Head, the Helmet of Salvation: Vpon thy Feet, Shooes of the Preparation Of Heav'ns Glad-tidings: Bear vpon thine Arm The Shield of Faith (Shot-free from every harm). Hell's fiery Darts repell thou with the same; And, through its splendor, quench their Flame with Flame: Take in thy hand the bright two-edged Sword Of God's Soule-parting, Marrow-pearcing, Word. Thus compleat arm'd from God's owne Arcenal, And watching duly for his Aid to call, Thou without doubt shalt quickly overcom The World, the Flesh, Sin, Death and Hell (in sum). And so (through Christ, thy Captain and thy King) Of Sin, thy Self, and Satan triumphing, Thou shalt (in fine) the Happy Crown obtain, And in th'Eternall Promis'd Kingdom raign. FINIS.

Lo, what your Love, and this Chimera's hate, Care of my Friends, Compassion of my Kin; Zeal of God's Glory, Horror of This Sin; My Soveraign's Service, Honour of our State: Lo, What All these had power to propagate (Perhaps, more happy than my Hope had bin, When first This Theam you gave mee to begin) Besides My Way, beyond My Waining Date. Lo, therefore, Whether, Well or Ill, I fare; Whether the doubtfull Field I win or lose; In Fame, or Shame, you needs must have a Share, Who on my Weaknes did This Waight impose.

Tis best Praise-worthy, To have pleas'd the Best: This Wee endevour; and defie the Rest. TOBACCO BATTERED. What-ever God created, first was good, And good for Man, while Man vprightly stood: But, falling Angels causing Man to fall, His foule Contagion con-corrupted All His fellow-Creatures, for his Sin accurst, And for his sake transformed from their First; Till God and Man, Mans Leprie to re-cure, By Death kill'd Death, re-making All things pure: But, To the pure; not to the still-Prophane, Who (Spider-like) turn Blessings into Bane; Vsurping (right-less, thank-less, need-less) heer, In wanton, wilfull, wastefull, lustfull Cheer, Earths plentious Crop, which God hath only given Vnto his Owne (Heires both of Earth and Heaven) Who only (rightly) may with Praise and Prayer, Enioy th'increase of Earth, of Sea, and Ayre, Fowle, Fish, and Flesh, Gems, Metalls, Cattell, Plants; And namely (That which now no Ingle wants) Indian TOBACCO, when due cause requires; Not the dry Dropsie of Phantastick Squires. None therefore deem that I am now to learn (How ever dim I many things discern) Reason and Season, to distinguish fit Th'Vse of a thing, from the Abuse of it; Drinking, from drunking, Saccharum cum Sacco; And taking of, from taking all TOBACCO. Yet out of high Disdain and Indignation, Of that stern Tyrant's strangest Vsurpation, Once, demi-Captive to his puffing Pride (As millions are, too-wilfull foolifi'd) Needs must I band against the need-less Vse Of Don TOBCCO, and his foule Abuse: Which (though in Inde it be an Herbe indeed). In Europe, is no better then a Weed; Which, to their Idols, Pagans sacrifize, And Christians (heer) doe wel-nigh Idolize: Which taking, Heathens to the Divels bow Their Bodies; Christians, even their Soules do vow. Yet th'Heathen have, with th'Ill, som Good withall; Sith, Their con-native, 'tis con-naturall. But, see the nature of abounding Sin, Which more abounding Punishment doth win For knowing Servants wilfull Arrogance, Then silly Strangers savage Ignorance. For, what to Them is Meat and Med'cinable, Is turn'd to Vs a Plague intollerable. Two smoakie Engines, in this later Age (Satans short Circuit; the more sharp his rage.) Have been invented by too-wanted Wit, Or rather, vented from th'Infernall Pit, Gvns and Tobacco-Pipes, with Fire and Smoak, (At least) a Third part of Mankind to choak: (Which, happely, 9. 17. th'Apocalyps fore-told) Yet of the Two, We may (think I) be bold, In som respects, to think the Last, the Worst, (How-ever Both in their Effects accurst.) For, Guns shoot from-ward, only at their Foen; Tobacco-Pipes, homeward, into their Owne (When, for the Touch-hole, firing the wrong end, Into our Selves the Poysons force we send: Those, in the Field, in brave and hostile manner; These, Cowardly, vnder a Covert Banner: Those, with Defiance, in a Threatfull Terror; These, with Affiance, in a Wilfull Error: Those (though loud-roaring, goaring-deep) quick-ridding; These, stilly stealing, longer Languors breeding: Those, full of pain (perhaps) and fell despight: These, with false Pleasure, and a seem-delight. (As Cars with Mice, Spiders with Flies) full rise Pipe-playing dallying, and deluding Life. Who would not wonder, in these Sunny-Dayes (So bright illightned with the Gospel's Rayes) Whence so-much Smoak, and deadly Vapors come, To dim and damne so much of Christendome? But, we must ponder too, These Dayes are Those Wherein the Divell was to be let lose; And Yawning broad Gate of that black Abyss To be set ope, whose Bottom bound-less is; That Satan, destin'd, evermore to dwell In Smoakie Fornace of that darksom Cell, In Smoak and darkness migh inure and train His Owne deer Minions, while they heer remain; As roaguing Gypsies, tanne their little Elves, To make them tann'd and ougly, like them Selves. Then, in Despite, who-ever dare say Nay, Tobacconists, keep-on your Course: You may, If you continue in your Smoaky Vre, The better far Hell's sulphury Smoak endure; And heerin (as in All your other Evill) Growe neerer still and liker to the Divell: Save that the Divell (if hee could revoke) Would flee from filthy and vnhealthy Smoak; Wherein (cast out of Heav'n for hellish pride) Vnwilling Hee, and Forced, doth abide: Which, heerin worse than Hee (the worst of Ill) You long-for, lust-for, ly-for, dy-for, still: For, as the Salamander lives in Fire, You live in Smoak, and without Smoak expire. Should it bee question'd (as right well it may) Whether Discouery of AMERICA, That New-found World, have yeelded to our Ould More Hurt or Good: Till fuller Answer should Decide the Doubt, and quite determine it, Thus for the present might wee answer fit: That, Thereby Wee have (rightly vnderstood) Both given and taken greater Hurt then Good: And that on both sides, both for Christians It had been better, and for Indians, That onely Good men to their Coast had com, Or that the Evill had still staid at home. For, what our People have brought Thence to vs, Is like the Head-peece of a Polypus, Wherein is (quoted by sage Plutarch's Quill) A Pest'lence great good, and great Pest'lence ill. We had from Them, first, to augment our Stocks, Two grand Diseases, Scurvy and The Pocks: Then, Two great Cordials (for a Counterpeiz) Gold and TOBACCO; both which, many waies, Have don more Mischief then the former Twain; And All together brought more Losse then Gain. But, true it is, wee had this Trash of Theirs, Onely in Barter for our broken Wares. Ours, for the most part, carried out but Sin; And, for the most part, brought but Vengeance, in: Their Fraight was Sloth, Lust, Avarice and Drink, (A Burthen able, with the Waight, to sink The hugest Carrak; yea, those hallowed Twelve, Spain's great Apostles, even to over-whelve) They carried Sloth, and brought home Scurvy Skin: They carried Lust, and brought home Pocks within: They carried Avarice, and Gold they got: They carried Bacchus, and TOBACCO brought. Alas, poor indians! that, but English, None Could put them down in their owne Trade alone! That None, but English (more Alas! more strange!) Could justifie their pitifull Exchange! Of All the Plants that Tellus bosom yields, In Groves, Glades, Gardens, Marshes, Mountains, Fields, None so pernicious to Man's Life is knowne; As is Tobacco, saving Hemp alone. Betwixt which Two there seems great Sympathy To ruinate poor Adam's Progeny: For, in them Both, a strangling vertue note, And Both of them doo work vpon the Throte; The one, within it; and without, the other; And th'one prepareth Work vnto the tother. For, There doo meet (I mean at Gail and Gallowes) More of these beastly, base Tobacco-Fellowes, Then else to any profane Haunt doo vse (Excepting still The Play-house and The Stewes) Sith 'tis their common Lot (so double-choaked) Iust bacon-like, to bee hangd vp and smoaked: A Destiny, as proper to befall To morall Swine, as to Swine naturall. If there bee any Herb, in any place, Most opposite to God's good Herb of grace, 'Tis doubt-less This: and this doth plainly prove-it; That, for the most, most grace-less men doo love-it, Or rather, doat most on this wither'd Weed, Them Selves as wither'd in all gracious Deed. 'Tis strange to see (and vnto mee, a Wonder) When the prodigious strange Abuse wee ponder Of this vnruly, rusty Vegetal; From modern Symmists Iesu-Critical, (Carping at Vs, and casting in our Dish, Not Crimes, but Crums: as eating Flesh for Fish:) W'hear, in This Case, no Conscience-Cases holier.] But, like to like; The Divell with the Collier. For a Tobacconist (I dare aver) Is, first of all, a rank Idolater, As any of th'Ignatian Hierarchy: Next, as conformed to Their Foppery, Of burning Day-light, and Good-night, at Noon, Setting-vp Candles to enlight the Sun: And last, the Kingdom of Nevv-Babylon Stands in a Dark and Smoaky Region; So full of such varietie of Smoaks, That there-with-all all Piety it choaks. For, There is, first, the Smoak of Ignorance, The Smoak of Error, Smoak of Arrogance, The Smoak of Merit super-er'gatory, The Smoak of Pardons, Smoak of Pvrgatory, The Smoak of Censing, Smoak of Thurifying: Of Images, of Satan's Fury-flying, The Smoak of Stewes (for, Smoaking thence they com, As horrid hot as torrid Sodom, som): Then, Smoak of Povvder-Treason, Pistols, Knives, To blowe-vp Kingdoms, and blowe-out Kings Lives; And lastly, too, Tobacco's Smoaky-Mists, Which (coming from iberian Baalists) No small addition of Adustion fit Bring to the Smoak of the Vnbottom'd Pit, Yerst opened, first (as openeth Saint Iohn) By their ABADDON and APOLLYON. But sith They are contented to admire What They dislike not, if they not desire (For, with good reason may wee ghess, that They Who swallow Camels, swallow Gnatlings may); 'Tis ground enough for vs, in this Dispute, Their Vanities, thus obvious, to refute (Their Vanities, Mysterious Mists of Rome, Which have so long be-smoaked CHRISTENDOM). And for the rest, it shall suffize to say, Tobacconing is but a Smoaky Play. Strong Arguments against so weak a thing Were need-less, or vnsuitable, to bring. In this behalf there needs no more bee done, Sith of it Self the same will vanish soon: T'evaporate This Smoak, it is enough But with a Breath the same aside to puff. Now, My First Puff shall but repell th'ill Savour Of Place and Persons (of debauscht behaviour) Where 'tis most frequent: Second, shew you will, How little Good it doth: Third, how great Ill. 'Tis vented most in Taverns, Tippling-cots, To Ruffians, Roarers, Tipsie-Tosty-Pots; Whose Custom is, between the Pipe and Pot, (Th'one Cold and Moist, the other Dry and Hot) To skirmish so (like Sword-and-Dagger-fight) That 'tis not easie to determine right, Which of their Weapons hath the Conquest got Over their Wits; the Pipe, or else the Pot. Yet 'tis apparant, and by proof express, Both stab and wound the Brain with Drunkenness: For, even the Derivation of the Name Seems to allude and to include the same: Tobacco, as ?? ????, one would say; To (Cup-god) Bacchus dedicated ay. And, for Conclusion of this Point, observe The Places which to these Abuses serve, How-ever, of them Selves, noisom enough, Are much more loathsom with the stench and Stuff Extracted from their limbeckt Lips and Nose. So that, the Houses, common Haunts of Those, Are liker Hell then Heav'n: for, Hell hath Smoak, Impenitent Tobacconists to choak, Though never dead: There shall they have their Fill: In Heav'n is none, but Light and Glory still. Next: Multitudes them daily, hourly, drown In this black Sea of Smoak, tost vp and down In this vast Ocean, of such Latitude, That Europe onely cannot all include, But out it rushes, over-runs the Whole, And reaches, well-ny round, from Pole to Pole; Among the Moors, Turks, Tartars, Persians, And other Ethnicks (full of Ignorance Of God and Good:) and, if wee shall look home To view (and rew) the State of Christendom; Vpon This Point, wee may This Riddle bring; The Subiect hath more Subiects than the King: For, Don TOBACCO hath an ampler Raign Than Don Philippo, the Great King of Spain (In whose Dominions, for the most, it growes). Nay, shall I say (O Horror to suppose!) Heathnish Tobacco (almost euery where) In Christendom (Christ's outward Kingdom heer) Hath more Disciples than Christ hath (I fear) More Suit, more Service (Bodies, Soules, and Good) Than Christ, that bought vs with his precious Blood. O Great TOBACCO! Greater than Great Can, Great Turk, Great Tartar, or Great Tamberlan! With Vulturs wings Thou hast (and swifter yet Than an Hungarian Ague, English Sweat) Through all Degrees, flowne far, nigh, vp and down; From Court to Cart; from Count to Country Clown, Not scorning Scullions, Cobblers, Colliers, Iakes-farmers, Fiddlers, Ostlers, Oysterers, Rogues, Gypses, Plaiers, Pandars, Punks, and All What common Scums in common-Sewers fall. For, all, as Vassals, at Thy Beck are bent, And breathe by Thee, as their new Element. Which well may prove Thy Monarchy the Greater; Yet prove not Thee to bee a whit the Better; But rather Worse: for, Hell's wide-open Road Is easiest found, and by the Most still troad. Which, even the Heathen had the Light to knowe By Arguments, as many times they showe. Heer may wee also gather (for a need) Whether Tobacco bee an Herb or Weed: And whether the excersive Vse bee fit, Or good or bad; by those that favour it, Weeds, wilde and wicked, mostly entertain it: Herbs, holesom Herbs, and holy mindes disdain it. If then Tobacconing bee good: How is't, That leudest, loosest, basest, foolishest, The most vnthrifty; most intemperate, Most vitious, most debauscht, most desperate, Pursue it most: The Wisest and the Best Abhor ir, shun it, flee it, as the Pest, Or pearcing Poison of a Dragons Whisk, Or deadly Ey-shot of a Basilisk? If Wisdom baulk it, must it not bee Folly? If Vertue hate it, is it not vnholy? If Men of Worth, and Mindes right generous, Discard it, scorn it; is't not scandalous? And (to conclude) is it not, to the Divell Most pleasing; pleasing so (most) the most Evill? My second Puff, is Proof How little Good This Smoak hath done (that ever hear I cou'd). For, first, ther's none that takes Tobacco most, Most vsually, most earnestly, can boast That the excessive and continuall vse Of This dry Suck-at ever did produce Him any Good, Civill, or Naturall, Or Morall Good, or Artificiall: Vnless perhaps they will alledge, It drawes- Away the Ill which still it Self doth cause. Which Course (mee thinks) I cannot liken better, Then to an Vsurer's Kindnes to his Debter; Who, vnder shew of lending, still subtracts The Debters Owne, and then His owne exacts; Till at the last hee vtterly confound-him, Or leave him Worse and Weaker then he found-him. Next, if the Custom of TOBACCONING Yeeld th'Vsers any Good in any thing; Either they have it, or they hope it prest (By proof and practice, taking still the best): For, none but Fools will them to Ought beslave, Whence Benefit they neither hope nor have. Therefore, yet farther (as a Questionist) I must enquire of my Tobacconist, Why, if a Christian (as som somtimes seem) Beleeving God, waiting all Good from Him, And vnto Him all Good again referring; Why (to eschew th'Vngodly's Grace-less erring) Why pray they not? Why praise they not His Name For hoped Good, and Good had by this Same? As all men doo, or ought to doo, for All The Gifts and Goods that from his Goodness fall. Is't not, because they neither hope nor have, Good (hence) to thank God for, nor farther crave: But, as they had it from the Heathen first; So, Heathnishly they vse it still, accurst: And (as som jest of Oisters) This is more Vngodly Meat, both After and Before. Lastly, if all Delights of all Mankinde Bee Vanity, Vexation of the Minde; All vnder Sun: Must not TOBACCO bee, Of Vanities, the vainest Vanity? If Salomon, the wisest earthly Prince That ever was before, or hath bin since; Knowing All Plants, and them perusing All, From Cedar to the Hyssop on the Wall; In none of all professeth, that hee found A firm Content, or Consolation sound: Can Wee suppose, that any Shallowling Can finde much Good in oft-Tobacconing? My Third and last Puff points at the Great Evill This noisom Vapor works (through wily divell). If wee may judge; if Knowledge may bee had By their Effects, how things bee good or bad; Doubtless, th'Effects of This pernicious Weed Bee mary bad, scarce any good, indeed: Nor dooth a Man scarce any Good contain, But of This Evill justly may complain; As thereby, made in every Part the Worse, In Body, Soule, in Credit, and in Purse. For, first of all, it falls on his Good-name, And so be-smears and so be-smoaks the same, That never after scarce discerned is't. Rare good Report of a Tobacconist: Where, if to take it, were a vertuous thing, 'Twould to the Taker's Commendation bring; And somwhat grace them (though they else were bad) Or hide, a little, the Defects they had: But, from their Credit rather it abates, And their Disgraces rather aggravates: And how-much better that they were before, It stinks the worse, and stains their Name the more. For, if a Swearer, or a Swaggerer, A Drunkeard, Dicer, or Adulterer, Prove a Tobacconist, it is not much: 'Tis sutable, 'tis well-beseeming Such (No less than flaring, garish, whorish Tire, Which now-adaies most Mad-dames most desire: Owle-faç't Chaprones, Cheeks painted, Izland Tresse, Bum Bosse-about, with broad deep-naked Brests; Borrowd and brought from loose Venetians, Becoms Pickt-hatch, and Shoreditch Courtizans). Not that Tobacconing is not amisse: But that the bright Noon of their better Vice, Spred far and wide, doth darken and put down TOBACCO-taking, and its Twilight drown. But, let it bee of any truly said, Hee's great, religious, learned, wise, or staid; But, hee is lately turn'd Tobacconist: O! what a Blur! what an Abatement is't! 'Tis like a handfull from Augaus Stable, Cast in the Face of Beauties fairest Table. Whence it appears, This too-too to frequent, It is not good; no, not indifferent. It best becomes a Stage, or else a Stewes, Or Dicing-house, where All Disorders vse. It ill beseems a Church, Colledge, or Court, Or any Place of any civill sort: It fits Blasphemers, Ruffians, Atheists, Damn'd Libertines, to bee Tobacconists: Not Magistrates, not Ministers, not Schollers (Who are, or should bee, Sins severe Comptrollers) Nor any wise and sober personage, Of Gravity, of Honesty, of Age. It were the fittest Furniture (that may) For Divell, in a Picture or a Play, To represent him with a fiery Face, His Mouth and Nostrils puffing Smoak apace, With staring Eyes, and in his griezly Gripe An over-grown, great, long TOBACCO-Pipe. Which sure (mee thinks) the most Tobacconist Must needs approve, and even applaud the Iest; But much more Christians hence observe, how evill It them becoms, that so becoms the Divell. And therefore, think This Weed, a Drug for Iews More fit by far [who did so foule abuse (Base rheumy Rascals) with their Spawlings base, Our loving Saviovr's lovely-reverend Face, Whom (wilfull-blinde, stiff-necked, stupesi'd) They spet on, scorned, scourged, Crucifi'd] Than for vs Christians, who his Name adore, Whom by His Death Hee doth to Life restore. If, notwithstanding All that hath been said, Tobacconists will still hold on their Trade, And by their practice still hold vp their Name, Though Iews, though Divells, better suit the same; I'll say no more but onely This, of This: Henceforth, let none whose meaner Lot it is To live in Smoak; Lime-burners, Alchymists, Brick makers, Brewers, Colliers, Kitchenists; Let Salamanders, Swallows, Bacon-stitches, Red-Sprats, red-Herings, and like Chimny-wretches, Think no Disparagement, nor hold them base: Tobacconists their Company will grace, And teach them make a Vertue of Necessity, Turning their Smoak into a grace-fool-Assity. Next the Good-Name, now let the Body showe What Wrongs to it from out Tobacco flowe: For, as That is Man's baser Part indeed, It is most basely handled by This Weed. And First (as was significantly said Before our Soveraign, by an Oxford Head) TOBACCO, Smoak into the Parlour puts, And basest Office in the best Room shuts, While to the Head it doth exhale and hoist The Bodies filthy and superfluous Moist; Causing a moist Brain, by vnceast Supply Of Rheums still drawn to th'Bodies Stillary: Which in experience, and in Reason, make Men most vnapt deep thing to vndertake. For, for the most part, shallow are the Wits, Conceipts and Counsels, of Tobacconists. Sith Wisdom dwells in Dry: Her proper Seat Is a dry Brain, embatteld well with Heat. Also, it fries and dries away the Blood (As did that Persian the Euphratean Flood, To conquer Babylon) by whose incrassion, The Vitall Spirits in an vnwonted fashion, Are bay'd, and barred of their Passage due Through all the veins, their vigour to renue: So that the Humours (as all out of frame) Tending to putrefie and to inflame, Fire the whole House; from whence there follows ever A dangerous, if not a deadly, Fever. Lastly, this boiling, broiling, of the Blood, Breeds much adusted, Melancholy-Mood (Satan's fit Saddle, from their sullen Cell, To ride, in poste, his wretched Slaves to Hell, With Two keen Spurres (too-quick in their Effect) Th'one of Excess, the other of Defect; A violent Passion, pushing Reason back, Or fell Despaire when Conscience is awake.) For, as of all insensibles, hath none More Melancholie and Adustion, Then Chimmes have: What kinde of Chimny is't Less Sensible then a Tobacconist? And in receiving Smoake, sith th'are so equall; Can their adustion then be much vnequall? Thus then the Habit of Tobacconing, Makes one more Chimny-like then any thing. Som also think it causeth exsiccation (As of the Blood, of Seed of generation; By th'accrimony stirring more to cover, Then fruitfully producing Issue of-it: Whence, we may learn to marvell so much less, That (for the most) our Gentles, that profess Tobacconisme, love Lemman-Sauce so well; Or that such Legions of the Base pel-mel, Vnder the Standard of TOBACCO, vse To Turn-bull first, then to Our Bartholmewes. And where there have been many great Inquests To finde the Cause Why Bodies still grow less, And daily neerer to the Pigmies Size; This among many Probabilities, May pass for one: that their Progenitours Did gladly foment their Interiours With holesom Food, vnmixed, moderate, And timely Liquors duely temperate: But, now-adayes, Their Issue inly choake And dry them vp (like Herrings) with This Smoake: For, Herrings, in the Sea, are large and full, But shrink in bloating and together pull: Whence, in effect, Smoak vnto Smoak referring, Tabacconists are not vnlike Red Herring. Vndoubtedly beyond all Moderation It dries the Bodie, robs of irrigation The thirsty parts; so that the bowels cry For Moist and Cold, to temper Hot and Dry Whence, th'Elementall Qualities of Theirs, In faction, fall together by the Eares. For, in the Hearb excess of Dry and Hot, Drawes-in excess of Cold-Moist from the Pot; For which they troup to th'Ale-house shortly after, As rats-ban'd Rats do hie them to the Water. And yet, their liquid Cooler cures them not, No more then Water doth the baned Rat: For th'Heat and Drought of th'Hearb American Being intensiue (fitter call'd Man-Bane) The one dries-vp the Humour Radicall, The other drowns the Calor Naturall. But the most certain and apparant Ill Is an Ill Habit which doth hant them still; Transforming Nature from her native Mould: For, Custom we another Nature hold. And This vile Custom is so violent, And holds his Customers at such a Bent, That though thereby more Hurt than Good they doubt; To die for it, they cannot live without. Which doubtless, is a miserable State: For, Men are surely the more Fortunate, Of fewer Creatures that they stand in need: More, but more Bondage, and less freedom breed. A House, that must have many Props and Stayes, Is neerer Fall, and faster it decayes: Variety and surfait feed the Spittle, And fill the Grave. Nature's content with little. Why then should Man, living and rationall, Beslave himselfe to a dead Vegetall? Why, demi-heavenly, and most free by Birth, Should he be bound vnto this Childe of Earth? Why, Lord of Creatures, should He serve: at least, Why such a Creature, baser then a beast? Oft had I seen Fooles of all sorts frequent it, Fooles of all Size Fooles of all Sexes hant it, Fooles of all Colours, Fooles of all Complexions, Fooles of all Fashions, Fooles of all Affections, Fooles naturall, Fooles artificiall, Fooles rich and poor, young Fooles, old Fooles, and all; Whom, Foole I pitied, for their wilfull Folly; Supposing, None discreetly Wise (or Holy) Could be entangled with so fond a thing, As is the habit of Tobacconing. For, what Discretion, or what Wisedom can, Think Physick Food, or Med'cine Meat, for Man? I rather thought Vlysses rather would Have stopt his Eeares, Eyes, Hands, and Mouth with-hold From such a Cyrcean Drug, whose working strange, Would soon his best into a Beast exchange. But wen I saw som Wise-ones snared-in This Spanish Cobweb (Satans speciall Gin) And that so fast, they cannot when they would Get out againe; or will not if they could: Wisdom, me thought, must varie much; or else This Ware is spiced with som Forrain Spels, So to bewitch the Wise (need-less, and nilling) To take and love; and not to leave it, willing. For, those that say and sweare they euen abhorre it, Cannot abandon, but Thus bandie for it: Tis good (say They) Tis speciall good for Rheumes; Exhales gross Humors, their Excesse consumes; And voids, with-all, all inconuenience There-on depending, or descending, Thence. Which should I grant, it must be yet with Clauses Of needfull Caution, suitable to Causes; When time requireth Preparation fit To rarifie congealed Rags of it; Which by the Heat and Drynesse, probably, This Plant performes, in mediocritie: Or else, where the aboundant Quantity, Dangerous Effect, malignant Quality, Of ouer-moistures, aske Euacuation, To free the Parts from totall Inundation. How-be-it, many safer Meanes there are. Better and fitter in themselues by farre; More certaine, more direct; with lesse adoo, Lesse Cost, lesse Damage, and lesse Danger too Than Don TOBACCO's damnable Infection, Slutting the Body, slauing the Affection. Twere therefore better somewhat else to seek, Then rest in this, so worthie of Dis-like; Sith, curing Thus one small Infirmity, It doth create a greater Malady, When there-by freed (perhaps) from Rheumes, we fall In Bondage of this Custome capitall. For, they that Physicke to a Custome bring, Bring their Disease too, to accustoming. Perpetuall Physicke must of force imply Perpetuall Sicknesse; or deep Foolerie Compos'd of Anticke and of Phrantick too: For, where's no Sickness, what should Med'cine doo? Thus for the Bodie: Now, the Soule diuine VVith This wilde Goose-Grasse of the Perusine Hath Foure great Quarels, in foure-fold respect Of her Foure Faculties; the Intellect, The Memory, the Will, the Conscience; All which are wronged, if not wounded, Thence. First, in the Intellect, it d'outs the Light, Darkens the House, th'vnderstandings Sight; Through neuer ceast succession of Humiditie, The Dam of dulnesse, Mother of Stupiditie; Making Mans generous Brain (best, dry and hot) Lie drown'd, and driueling like a Changeling Sot. Why then should Man, to put out Reason's Eye, Suffer his Soule in Smoakie Lodge to lye? For, though some others, and my Selfe by proofe (When scornefully I tooke it but in Snuffe; Haue thereby sometimes found some benefit; Superfluous Humors from the Brain to quit, To cleer the Voyce and cheere the Phantasie, Which, for the present, it did seem supply: Yet doth the Custome (as we likewise finde) Dis-nerue the Bodie, and dis-apt the Minde. Next; It decayes and mars the Memorie, And brings it to strange Imbecillitie, By still attraction of continuall Moist, Which from the lower parts it wonts to hoist: For, though best Memory dwel in a Brain. Moist-moderate; Yet ouer-moist, againe Makes it so laxe, so diffluent and thin, That nothing can be firmely fixt there-in; But instantly it slides and slips-away, As weary heeles on wet and slippery Clay. For Proofe whereof: None more forgetfull is Of God and Good, than are Tobacconists. Touching th'Affections, they are tir'd no lesse By This fell Tyrants insolent Excesse: For, the Adustion of th'inherent Heat, Drought, Acrimonie (Tartar-like) doth fret; Makes men more sodain and more heed-less heady, More sullen-sowr, more stubbornely vnsteady, More apt to wrath to wrangle, and to braule; To giue and take a Great Offence, for Small; Cause-less Reioycing, and as cause-less Sory, Exceeding-Mournefull, and excessiue-Merry: Whence growes, in fine, excessiue Griefe and Fear; For Dumpier none than the Tobacconer: None sadder than the gladdest of their Host; None hating more than hee that loued most; None fearing more, none danted more than such As, in a Passion, rather dar'd too-much. For, Relatiues inseparable dwell: And Contraries their Contraries expell. And (with th'old Poet) Tis the Cox-combs Course, Flying a Fault, to fall into a VVorse. But if they say, that sometimes, taking it, The Minde is fre'ed from some instant Fit Of Anger, Griefe, or Feare; Experience tells It is but like some of our Tooth-ake Spells, Which for the present seem to ease the Pain, But after, double it with more Rage again; Because a little, for the time, it drawes, But leaues behinde the very Root and Cause. Lastly, the Conscience (as it is the best) This Indian Weed doth most of all molest; Loading it daily with such Weight of Sin, Whereof the least shall at the last com-in To strict Account: the Losse of precious hours, Neglect of God, of Good, of Vs, of Ours: Our ill Example, prodigall Excess, Vain Words, vain Oaths, Dice, Daring, Drunkenness, Sloath, jesting, scoffing, turning Night to Day, And Day to Night; Disorder, Disaray; Places of Scorn and publick Scandall hanting; Persons of base and beastly Life frequenting; Theeves, Vnthrifts, Russians, Robbers, Roarers, Drabbers, Bibbers, Blasphemers, Shifters, Sharkers, Stabbers: This is the Rendez-vous, These are the Lists, Where doo encounter most Tobacconists: Wherein they walk, like a blinde Mill-horse, round In the same Circle, on the self same ground; Forgetting how, Daies, Months, and Yeers, doo passe; No more regarding, than an Ox or Asse, How Age growes on, how Death attendeth them, God knowes how neer (Whom on each side behem A late Repentance, or a flat Despair) And after That, a noisom stinking Air Of their infamous rotten Memory With Men on Earth; in Heav'n with God on hie A Fearfull Doom; and finally in Hell, Infinity of Fiery Torments fell. The Last and Least of all TOBACCO-harms Is to the Purse: which yet it so becharms, That Iuggler-like it jests-out all the Pelf, And makes a Man a Pick-purse to himself. For, as by This, th'Iberian Argonauts May bee suppos'd (even emong serious Thoughts) T'have kill'd more Men than by their Martyrdom, Or Massacre (which yet to Millions com) So, by the Same they have vndon more Men, Than Vsury (which takes from Hundred, Ten) And no-where more than in This witched Isle: Wo to their Frauds, Wo to vs Fools, the-while. How-many Gentles, not of Meanest Sort (Whose Fathers liv'd in honourable Port, For Table, Stable, and Attendance fit; Loving their Country, and belov'd of it). Leaving their Neighbours, flee from their Approach; And, for the most, keep House in a Caroach (Hell's new-found Cradles! where are rockt asleep Mischiefs that make our Common-weal to weep.) Or in som Play-house, or som Ordinary, Or in som Piece of som Vn-Sanctuary; Where, through their Pipe-puft Nose more Smoak they wave, Than all the Chimnies their great Houses have; Consuming more, in their Obscure Obscænity, On Smoak and Smock, with their appendent Vanity, Than their brave Elders did, when they maintain'd Honour at home, and forrain Glory gain'd. How doo they rack, and wrack, and grate, and grinde, Shuffle and cut, wrangle, and turn, and winde, Borrow and beg (vnder a Courtly Cloak) And all too-little for This liquorish Smoak! Alas the while! that men Thus needs will bee Begger'd, vndon (of no Necessity) In Body, Minde, and Means; vnapt, vnable For any Good, through this so needless Bable. For, What a Folly, through the Nose to puff Th'whole Bodie's Portion in this idle stuff! Or, what need any with TOBACCO, more Now meddle, than his Ancestors before? Who knew it not, but had, without it, Health, Liv'd long and lusty, in abundant Wealth. Or, what is any, when hee all hath spent, The better for This dear Experiment? Which now-adaies a number daily finde Like Alchymie (though in another Kinde) To circulate, and calcinate (at length) Insensibly (Tobacco hath such strength) Manours, Demains, Goods, Cattell, Elm and Oak, Gold, Silver, All; to Ashes and to Smoak, While all, too-busie blowing at the Coal, Deject their Body, and neglect their Soule. For, O! What place is left to Christianity, 'Mongst such a Crew (nay, almost to Humanity) Where Oaths, Puf-snuffing, Spauling-Excrement, Are reall Parts of Gentles Complement? And, for our Vulgar, by whose bold Abuse Tobacconing hath got so generall Vse; How mightily have They since multipli'd Taverns, Tap-houses! where, on every side, Most sinfully hath Mault been sunken heer In nappy Ale, and double-double-Beer; Invincible in a Threefold Excess; Strong Drink, strong Drinking, and strange Drunkenness: Which on the Land hath brought, so visibly, So great a Mischief, so past Remedy, That Thousands daily into Beggery sink Through Idlenesse; in wilfull Debt for Drink. Nor can the Lawe's seuerest Curb keep-in This coltish, common, priuiledged Sin. Then (shallow Reptile, superficiall Gnat) Why doe I humme? why doe I hisse there-at? Bvt, awfull Iustice will with keener Edge Clip short (I hope) this sawcie Priuiledge; And at one Blowe cut-off this Ouer-Drinking, And euer Dropsie of TOBACCO-stinking: When Our Alcides (thoug at Peace with Men, At Warre vvith Vices) as His armed Pen [Among the Labovrs of his Royall hand, Where Piety and Prudence (ioyntly) stand Eternall Pillers to His glorious Name; Vnto all Times to testifie the same, BRITANN's right Beau-Clerk, both for Word and Writ: The Miracle, The Oracle of Wit: For Knowledge, Iudgement, Method, Memory: Diuine and Morall ENCYCLOPAEDIE] Hath, as with Arrowes, from His sacred Sides, All-ready chaç't These stinking Stymphalides; Shall, with the Trident of some sharp Edict, Seuere enacted, executed strict, Clense all the Staules of This Augæan Dung, Which hath so long corrupted Old and Young: Or, at the least, impose so deep a Taxe On All these Ball, Lease, Cane and Pudding Packs; On Seller, or on Buyer, or on Both, That from Henceforth the Commons shal be loath (Vnwilling-Wise) with that graue Greeke, to buy Smoak and Repentance at a Price so hie. If, notwithstanding, Yet some Wealthy, will Needs poyson, and vndoo them with it, still; It shall be onely some of Those profane Loose Prodigals (their Countries Blot and Bane) Best to be spar'd, least to be mist; whose Lands (If anie left) will come to Wiser hands Than such weak Ninnies, needing Wardship yet; Not for their want of Age, but want of VVit. Aviaius Cassius (as Lampridius showes) Did first inuent, and first of all impose That vncouth Manner of tormenting Folk; On a high Beame to smoother them with Smoak: Where had TOBACCO bin then known, he need But haue enioyn'd them to haue tane that Weed. But, with more Reason and more Equitie, Seuerus Cæsar when he did discry The double-dealing of Vetronius [A Cousening Courtier (Such are none with Vs.)

And, if the Sentence of this Heathen Prince, On That Impostor, for his Impudence, Were iust: How iuster will the Heau'nly God, Th'Eternal, punish with infernall Rod, In Hell's darke Fornace (with black Fumes, to choak) Those, that on Earth will still offend in Smoak? Offend their Friends, with a Most vn-Respect: Offend their Wiues and Children, with Neglect: Offend the Eyes, with foule and loathsom Spawlings: Offend the Nose, with filthy Fumes exhalings: Offend the Eares, with lowd lewd Execrations: Offend the Mouth, with ougly Excreations: Offend the Sense, with stupefying Sense: Offend the Weake, to follow their Offense: Offend the Body, and offend the Minde: Offend the Conscience in a fearefull kind: Offend their Baptisme, and their Second Birth: Offend the Maiestie of Heau'n and Earth. Woe to the World because of Such Offenses; So voluntaire, so voyd of all pretenses Of all Excuse (saue Fashion, Custome, Will) In so apparant, proued, granted, Ill.

LACRYMÆ LACRYMARVM: OR The Spirit of Teares, Distilled For the vn-timely Death of The incomparable Prince, HENRY (Late) Prince of Wales. By Iosvah Sylvester. LACRYMÆ LACRYMARVM. A Funeral Elegie. The Argument, in an Epitaph. Here lyes (Drie Eies, read not This Epitaph.) Here lyes Great-Britans Stay, Great Iacob's Staff: The stately Top-bough of Imperiall Stemme, World's richest Iewell, Nature's rarest Gemme, Mirror of Princes, Miracle of Youth, All Vertues Pattern, Patron of all Truth; Refuge of Armes, ample Reward of Arts, Worth's Comforter, milde Conquerer of Hearts: The Churche's Tower, the Terror of the Pope, Heröik HENRY, Atlas of our Hope. How-euer, short of Others Art and Wit, I knowe my powers for such a Part vnfit; And shall but light my Candle in the Sun, To doe a work shall be so better Donne: Could Teares and Feares giue my Distractions leaue, Of sobbing words a sableWebbe to weaue; Could Sorow's Fulnes giue my voice a vent; How would, how should, my saddest Verse lament, In deepest Sighes (in stead of sweetest Songs) This loss (alas!) which vnto All belongs! To All, alas! though chiefly to the Chief; His royal Parents, Principalls in grief: To All the Peers, to all Confederate, To All the Chvrch, to all the Christian State: To all the Godly now, and future, far: To all the World; except S.P.Q.R. To all together and to Each a-part, That liues, and loues Religion, Armes, or Art: To all abroad; but, to Vs most of all That neerest stood to my High Cedars fall: But, more then most, to Mee, that had no Prop But Henry's Hand, and, but in Him, no Hope: In Whom, with Nature, Grace and Fortune met, To consummate a Prince, as Good as Great: In Whom, the Heav'ns were pleas'd to shew the Earth A richer Iewell then the World was worth, Or worthy of: therefore, no more to make So rare a Piece, His pretious Mould they brake. O sudden Change! O sad Vicissitude! O! how the Heav'ns our Earthly Hopes delude! O! what is firm beneath the Firmament! O! what is constant heer that gives Content! What Trust in Princes! O! what Help in Man, Whose dying life is but a length in span! Melting, as Snowe, before the Mid-day Sun; Past, as a Poste, that speedy by dooth run; Swift, as the Current of the quickest Stream; Vain, as a Thought; forgotten, as a Dream. O Dearest Henry, Heav'n and Earth's Delight! O clearest Beam of Vertues, Rising bright! O purest Spark of Pious Princely Zeal! O surest Ark of Iustice sacred Weal! O gravest Presage of a Prudent Kinde! O bravest Message of a Valiant Minde! O All-admir'd, Benign and Bountious! O All-desired (right) Panaretvs! Panaretvs (All-vertuous) was thy Name; Thy Nature such: such ever bee thy Fame. O Dearest! Clearest! Purest! Surest Prop! O Gravest! Bravest! Highest! Nighest Hope! O! how vntimely is this Sun gon down! This Spark put out! This Ark (as) overthrowne! This Presage crost! This Message lost and left! This Prop displac't! This Hope of All, bereft! O! how, vnkinde! how, grace-less! how, ingrate! Have Wee cut-off Thy likely longer Date! For, were this Stroak from Heav'ns immediat hand; Or (by Heav'ns leave) from Hell's suborned Band Of Romvlides (What dare not They presume? If this, That Sea a Sulphury Sea consume.) How-e'r it were, Wee were the Mooving Cause That sweet Prince Henry breath no longer draws. Wee all (alas!) have had our hands heerin: And Each of vs hath, by som cord of Sin, Hal'd down from Heav'n, from Iustice awfull Seat, This Heavie Iudgement (which yet more doth threat). VVee Clergy first, who too-too-oft have stood More for the Church-goods, then the Churches good: Wee Nobles next, whose Title, ever strong, Can hardly offer Right, or suffer Wrong: Wee Magistrates, who, mostly, weak of sight, Are rather fain to feel then see the Right: Wee Officers, whose Price of every Place Keeps Vertue out, and bringeth Vice in grace: Wee Gentry then, who rack, and sack, and sell, To swim, like Sea-Crabs, in a foure-wheel'd Shell: Wee Courtiers next, who French-Italianate, Change (with the Moon) our Fashion, Faith, and Fate: Wee Lawyers then, who, Dedalizing Law, And deading Conscience, like the Horse-leach drawe: Wee Citizens, who, seeming Pure and Plain, Beguile our Brother, make our god our Gain: Wee Countrimen, who slander Heav'n and Earth As Authors of our Artificiall Dearth: Wee Pourveyours, last, who, taking ten for two, Rob both, at once, our Prince and People too: All, briefly all, all Ages, Sexes, Sorts, In Countries, Cities, Benches, Churches, Courts, (All Epicures, Wit-wantons, Athëists, Mach'-Aretines, Momes, Tap-To-Bacchonists, Bats, Harpies, Sirens, Centaurs, Bib-all-nights, Sice-sink-ap-Asses, Hags, Hermaphrodites) And We, poor Nothings (fixed in no Sphear, Right Wandring Tapers, Erring every where) Scorn of the Vulgar, Scandall of the Gown, Have puld this waight of Wrath, this Vengeance down. All, All are guilty, in a high Degree, Of This High-Treason and Conspiracy; More brute then Brutus stabbing more then Cæsar, With Two-hand-Sins of Profit and of Pleasure; And (th'odious Engin, which doth all include) Our many-pointed proud Ingratitude. For, for the Peoples Sinnes, for Subiects crimes, God takes-away good Princes oftentimes. So, good Iosiah (Henry's parallel) Was soon bereft from Sin-full Israel: So, our good Edvvard (Henry's Precedent) For England's Sins was hence vntimely hent. So, heer, good Henry is new taken hence, For now Great-Britan's great Sins Confluence. Wee see th'Effect: wee have the Cause confest: O! Turn wee then, with speed, to save the Rest: O! Turn vs, Lord, turn to vs, turn away Thy Frowns, our Fears, with humblest Tears, we pray. O save our Soverain; save his Royall seed; That still his Owne may on his Throne succeed. Let Each of vs make priuie Search within; And hauing found, bring forth the Traitor Sin To Execution, with all Execration Henceforth renouncing such In-Sin-newation. Let Each of vs (as Each hath throw'n a Dart, A Dart of Sinne, at Henry's princely heart) Send-vp in Sighes our Soules deuoutest breath, To Shield our Iames, Anne, Charles, Elizabeth, And Hih whose Loue shall render Her her Brother, And make Her soon a happy Princes Mother. Let Each of vs cease to lament (in vain) Prince Henry's Loss: Death is to Him a Gain. For Sauoy's Dukelings, or the Florentine, He Wedds his Sauiour of a Regal Line; Glory, for Gold; for Hope, Possession (there) Of Crownes so Rich as neuer entred Eare, Eye neuer sawe, nor euer Heart conceav'd; So strong Assur'd as cannot be bereau'd. Waile not his death: His Vertues cannot Dye; Immortall Issue of Eternity. His Soule in Blisse behoulds her Makers Eyes: His goodly Body shall more glorious Rise. Weep not for Him: weep for our selues, alas! (Not for our Priuate, or Peculiar case: As, for our Sonn's, Brother's, or Master's lack, Or Prince's loss (our Expectations wrack) Our Places, Graces, Profits, Pensions lost, Our present Fortunes cast, our future crost) Weep for our Sinnes, our Wicked-Prouocations, Our haynous, horrid, high Abominations; Both seen and secret; both in High and Lowe: VVeep, weep for These; and stript, from Top to Toe, Of giddie-Gaudes, Top-gallant Tires and Towers, Of Face-pride, Case-pride, Shin-pride, Shoo-pride, ours (Like Ninivites so neer Their threatned Fall) In blackest Sack and Cinders shrouded All: Not like a Bul-rush for a day or two, To stoop, and droop, and seem as others doe (As Achab yerst, and Pharao, in Distress) And then return vnto our old Excess (As Doggs vnto their Mewt, Hoggs to their Mire) But, day by day; vntill our last expire, With bended Knees, but more with broken hearts, And th'inward rest of right Repentant Parts, Prostrate our Soules in Fasting and in Praier, Before the Foot-stool of th'Empyreall Chaire: That So, VVhat-euer bloody Delvge float From th'old Red Dragon's wide-wide-yawning Throat, We, Humbled Movrners may be Heav'nly Markt, In Mercie's Vessell to be All imb Arkt.

William Sidney Knight, Sonne and Heire apparant To The Right Honourable Robert, Lord Sidney L. Vi-Count Lisle; L. Chamberlain to the Queen, and L. Gouernour of His Maiesties Cautionarie Town of Vlvshing. By Iosvah Sylvester. TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, the Lord Vi-count Lisle, and his most vertuous Lady: To Sir Robert Sidney, Knight, their Hopefull Sonne: To the most Worthy Lady Wroth, with the rest of their right vertuous Daughters: and To all the Noble Sidneys and Semi-Sidneys. Although I knowe None, but a Sidney's Muse, Worthy to sing a Sidney's Worthyness: None but Your Owne Anagram. La: Wroth. Al-Worth, Sidnëides, In whom, her Vncle's noble Veine renewes: And though I know (sad Nobles) to infuse My fore-spent Drops into the bound-lesse Seas Of Your deep Griefs, for your deer Ioy's Decease; To Your full Ocean nought at-all accrues: Yet, as (the Floods Queen) Amphitrite daignes To take the Tribute of small Brooks and Bournes; Which to Her Bounty (that Their Streams maintains) The humble Homage of Their Thanks returnes; Accept These Sighes and these few Teares of Ours, Which haue their Course but from the Source of Yours. Your Noble Name's and Vertue's most Observant, Iosvah Sylvester. AN ELEGIAC EPISTLE What Obiect, less then our Great Henry's Herse, Could so haue seiz'd the voice of euery Verse? What Subiect else could haue ingrossed so The publique Store and priuate Stock of Woe? What Sea, but th'Ocean of His Vertues Fame, Could drink all Teares, or drown a Sidney's Name (As buried quick) so quickly (though so yong) So vn-bewayled, sovn-sigh't, vn-sung? O, glorious Henry! though alone to Thee, I owe my all, and more then all of Mee; And though (alas!) the best and most of mine Reach not the least, the lowest Dues of Thine: Yet, wouldst thou, couldst Thou hear (as heer-to-fore) And grant a Boon; I onely would implore Thy leaue a little, for a Sidney's Death To sigh a little of my Mournfull breath: The rather, that, as Yerst Hee seru'd You heer, And, in His End attended Yours so neer; Through-out all Ages subsequent to Ours, His Name and Fame may ever waite on Yovrs: Sith All the Mvses owe that Name alone, A Dia-pason of each sad-sweet Groan: But, more peculiar, and precisely, Mine; Lineally bound vnto That Noble Ligne. Arcadians knowe no Other, for Apollo, No other Mars (in Arms or Arts to follow As Demi-Gods, as well of Warre as VVit) Then Sidneys yerst, or Semi-Sidneys, yet. Yet, fit I said: for, of This deare Descent, Nature (of late) too-lauishly hath spent, (Like My Ill-Huswifes which at once doe burn Two or three lights, where One would serue the turn) Not her Own only, but more orient Gemms, More rich, more rare; more fitting Diadems. As, first, th'old Father, famous-fortunate, The prime firm Founder of our Irish State: Next, His Son Philip (more then Philip's Son) Whose World of Worth, a World of Honor won: Then, His sole Heire (sole Venvs-Ivno-Pallas) All Beauties Pattern, and All Vertues Palace; (Whose memory, on Mvses Fairest Hill Is Canonized, by a Phœnix Quill). These Three, the which Three Ages might have grac't, All These and moe in My short Age have past: Besides This new Sweet-William now deceast (Th'Epitome and Summe of All the rest) The Flower of Youth, of Honor, Beauty, Blood, Th'Apparant Heire of All the SIDNEYS Good; For Minde, for Mould, for Spirit, Strength, and Stature, A Miracle, a Master-peece of Nature. Alas! How grossely doo our Painters erre In drawing Death's grim Visage (every-where) With hollow holes, as wholly dark and blinde! As! See we not, how still Hee sees to finde The fairest Mark, the rarest and the best Of Vertues Budds, and lets alone the rest? Ravens, Brambles, Bandogs, Sirens, heer he leaves; Swans, Roses, Lions, Dians, hence he reaves: Nay; th'onely Phoenix hath he newly slain (But, maugre Death, That Bird reviues again). No marvaile then, if SIDNEYS fall so fast. So earely ripe are seldom apt to last: So Eminent are imminent to die; Malicious Death doth Such so eas'ly spie. But, why of Death and Nature, rave I Thus; Another Stile (my LISLE) befitteth vs. Another Hand, another Eye, directs Both Death and Nature in These high Effects; The Eye of Providence, the Hand of Power, Disposing All in Order and in Hower; So working in, so waking over All, That but by Those doth Nothing heer befall. Then, not (as Currs) the stone or staffe to bite, Vn-heeding why, or who doth hurl or smite; Vnto That Eye let vs erect our owne; And humble vs vnder That Hand alone, Which as the Potter his owne Work controules) Dissolveth Bodies, and absolveth Soules: Vn-partiall ever, Vn-preposterous; How-ever Other it may seem to vs. For, ever since first Woman teemed Twin, And at a Birth brought forth both Death and Sin (Sin, as her Heir; Death, as an Heritage Iustly deriued down from Age to Age) It is Decreed (by a more Change-lesse Lawe: Then euer yet the Medes and Persians sawe) That All men once (as well as Lowe, the High, Of Either Sex, of Every Sort) must die. Yea, th'Innocent, for Our imputed Ill (Who came, not Lawes to break, but to ful-fill) The Son of God (The Son of Man become) Th'Immortall yielded to This mortall Doome. So that (for Sin) no Son of Man hath breath But once must dye. Wages of Sin is Death. As for the reason, Why it comes to passe Somtimes, that Age seems to haue turn'd his Glasse; While oftentimes Youth's, yer it seem begun, Is crackt, or broken, or already run: Why Lillies, Roses, Gillie flowers, be reft; VVhen Nettles, Thistles, Hemlocks heere be left: Why Cedars, Okes, Vines, Oliues, rather fall, Then Brush and Bryars (good for nought at all) Let Flesh and Blood, let Dust, be rather mute, Then with His MAKER sawcily dispute. Yet heer (me thinks) but little Question needs. Doe not We rather gather Herbes then Weeds? Doe not VVe take the timber for our turn, And leaue the Dottrells, in their time to burn? And, in the Shambles, who is it but would Be rather sped of yong Flesh then of old? And yet in Season, when we see it good, Wee weed our Gardens, fell our Vnder-wood: And kill old Cattell, least they goar the yong, Or fall away, or mix some Mange among. Much like, the Lord, who knoweth best all Season, And best obserues. But, will we vrge his Reason? His Reason is His Wil: His Wil is iust, Or rather Iustice; which His Power must In Wisedome execute (right vnderstood) To His Owne Glory, and His Childrens Good; Wherein His Goodnes through His Mercy shines, To cleer and cheer devout and humble mindes. For, to the Godly (in despight of Hell) Heav'n maketh all things to re-issue well. Heer, heer's a Harbour; heer's a quiet Shore From Sorrowe's Surges, and all Storms that rore. This is Cap Comfort (a high Promontorie, Of richer Store then heer is roome to storie). Heer let vs bide, and ride-out all Events, With Anchor Hope, and Cable Patience; Vntill our Bark some happy Gale shall driue Home to the' Haven where we would All arriue. Come, Noble Vi-Count, put into This Bay, Where (with a Light) our A'm'ral leads the way, Though deepest laden, and the most distrest, The greatest Ship of Burthen, and the best. Him boldly follow: &amp; though heer, as CHIEF In Grief, as Greatnes, His must drown your Grief, Count it an Honour, to be call'd to try Your Vertue's Valour, in your Soueraine's eye. Wee All partake His Cross; His Losse is Ours: But His Affections (to the life) are Yours. The neerer then You match His mournfull fate, His royal Patience neerer imitate. And you, sad Lady, Mother of annoy For hauing lost the prime Sonne of your Ioy; Ah! see, the Soueraine of your Sex hath so. Some think it ease, to haue some peer in Woe: But such a PEER, and such a Pattern too, Should much (me thinks) confirm &amp; comfort You To beare-vp hard into this happy Road, And lighten somwhat of Your heauy Load: The rather, sith besides the Happinesse, Which now, aboue, your Darling doth possesse; (The Crown, the Kingdom, and the Companie Of All the holy, heauenly HIERARCHIE) Besides your Mess of goodly GRACES left (Whose Worth, from All, the Prize of Worth hath reft; Foure louely Nymphs, foure Riuers, as it were, Your veines of Vertue through the Land to bear) You haue another Model of The same, To propagate renowned SIDNEY'S Name; Another, like in every part to proue As worthy of our Honor; and your Loue; In whom (if now, You, Ioe-like, bear this Cross) Heav'n may restore you, manifould your Loss.

From Man-Gods Birth (the Scale of Earth to Heau'n) Th'Yeer twice Eight hundred and twice single Seau'n: Amidst the Month which Second Cæsar names; Vpon the Day which Diane vveekely clames: About the Hower that golden Morpheus vses Phantastikly to feast perplexed Muses (VVhile Phœbus Coach-man scarce awake, did seem Hying to harness all his fiery Teem) Being, me thought (ith'VVard-robe, or at Waltham) Among the Chief, where Grief did so assault 'em: (On Either side) that neither Great nor Small Had one dry Eye, to see My sight vvithall: Me thought, I saw a White bright-shining Creature (Iust in the Forme of Honor's vvonted Feature) Approaching softly to a Sable Bed, Where weeping Sorrow layd his sleepeless head; And, with a Voice like one deuoutly praying, Shrill-softly, Thus (me thought) I heard it saying: Sweet Loue My Lord, Loadstar of my Desire, Whose purest flame had only power to fire The Icie Fort of Honor's chaste Affection, Wonne by thy loue; but more by thy Perfection: Deere Soule, which draw'st (by vnseen vertue) so, My Soule to greet thee once yet yer I go; Cease, cease to weep, giue ouer Sighes and sobbing, Thine eyes of Rest, thy brest of Comforts robbing: For, though soft Water hardest Marble weares, Flint-harted Death is neuer pearç't with Teares. Vse therefore other Arms against his Rages: And, of Thy loue, giue more autentik Gages. Whom yerst I chose among the choicest Worth Of British Gallants (ouer South and North) For Parts and Port; for mild and Martiall manner, In braue Deseignes to do their Country honor: Who, in mine eye, seem'd to excell the rest, And Whom my Mind esteem'd aboue the best; Must not expresse His loue to Mee, departed, With vulgar Showes of the most-vulgar-hearted. No: light Me Lamps that may Thy loue become; Such as may shine, about, aboue my Tombe, To all Beholders, as a holy Mirror, Reducing Nobles from Ignobles Error: Or as a Pharus to direct the Court, From Rocks and Wracks into the Happy Port. For, though my loue seek but my Hay and Denny, My Charitie is heer in meant to Many. As from the Dead, I come, the Quick to call From Sinn's deep Sleep: and Thee (Deer) first of All. Deer, if thou yet hold-deer a Soule deuested Of worldly Pomp (which hath the World impested) Sweet heart, put-off; sweet Hay, now, leaue Thou, quick, What (O!) I left not, till nigh deadly Sick: Forsake the VVorld yer it haue Thee forsaken; And, yer thy Youth with Ruth be ouer-taken, Regard thy Soule, thy Bodie lesse respect: Kill Vanitie, curbe euery fond Affect, Whereby the World still striueth to imprison The purest Raies of Man's diuinest Reason. Creep heer no longer with thy mortall Dust; Climbe with thy fiery Soule vp to the Iust, Exhale thee so, in heau'nly things admiring, As to the Place of thy first Birth aspiring. Few are thy Dayes with many Dolors fill'd, With Hoping tired, with Desiring kill'd, Yer thou attain what thou would'st fain and merry: Or, if thou doost, anon it makes thee weary. For, what Delight that euer Earth thee lent, Hast thou aye found pleasing and permanent? Honour's faire Mask, for all the Pomp and Brauerie, In golden Gyues is chaind to Silken Slauery. VVealth, which the World holds super-Souerain, With vse, doth vanish; without vse, is vaine: And Both too often (as Coat-Cards may cotten) Vnworthily, as well are lost, as gotten. Few Obiects heer (my Deer) but subiect bee To Labour more then vnto Libertie: Youth's Health and Strength are quickly quasht, or dated: Pleasure and Loue as soon are crost, or sated: Affront still driues the VVeakest to the Wal: The Mightiest ay are vnder Enuie's Maule: A lowely Fortune is of all despised: A lofty one, oft, of itselfe, nullized. In Brief, Deere Soule, thou seest how Certain Fate Conduces all things to their finall Date. As on the Shore a rowling Billow splitteth, When foaming high, and roaming home, it hitteth Against the keen Knees of a horned Cliff, Ending his course in an Incounter stiff; Then swels another, which yet higher wallowes, In the same course; Whom the same Fortune follows: So, VVe (O Worlds-Waues!) as soon dead as borne, With diuers Shock, on the same Rock are torn. This Age hath show'n great Fortune's greedy Minions (By hook or crook) aboue the Worlds Opinion? Aboue their owne Hopes: nay, aboue well-nigh The clowded Aime of their insatiate Eye: But, now where are they? Where's their Grace? their Glorie? Rotten in dust; forgotten all their Storie (Vnless, perhaps, what heere so goodly shin'd, Went out in Snuffe, and left ill sent behinde) And all their vaine Fume, turn'd to violent Fire, For euer burns (such is Ambition's Hire): Where, too-too late, they finde, vnto their Cost, Such Fauors, so found, had bin better lost. Soul's sad Repenting, and Hearts heauie Throeing, Are surest Fruits that in the World are growing: Heer's Nothing firmer, nothing frequent more, Then Death: Which (liuing) not to minde before, Makes Men run headlong to the Gulf infernall; And, for howers Ioyes, to lose the Ioyes eternall: Draw'n diuersly by diuers Appetites, After the Humors of their vain Delights. Some Apish, acting euery Fashions Model: Some Swinish, wallowing in their Surfuits Puddle: Some Goatish, haunting Fillies with their Dams: Some Woluish, worrying Innocentest Lambs: Some Currish, snarling at all good mens Good: Some Monkish, hollow vnder Holy-Hood: Some Brutish, Monsters in all kind of Euill: Some Hellish, Actors, Factors for the Diuell. Deare, tread not Thou in Errors common Track: But, in thy Life sure thine Election make. Fear, loue, belieue, serue, sorrow, sue, contemple; And rather walk by Precept, then Example. 'Tis vtterlie to be of iudgement void, 'Tis wilfullie to haue ones Selfe destroyd; To trust our Soule with such whose Stipulation Cannot repaire, cannot repriue, Damnation. Who, curious, cares but for the things belowe, Shall finde, in fine, that he shall Both forgoe: But Hope of things aboue (with due progression) Is far more sure, then th'others full Possession. Labour Thou therefore for the certain Gain: And, if thou lov'st mee, higher, higher strain. In Holy Pride, hence-forth disdaign the Creature, And mount thy Thoughts vp to the Lord of Nature: Loue, free thy loue from this dark Dungeon heer, And hence-forth fix it in th'Empyreall cleer: Whither no sooner shall thy Mind be raised, But all thy Mournings will be soon appeased, With other Comforts then the World affords In bitter Deeds candied in sugar Words. The World it Selfe is dying and decaying: The Earth more sterile, Heau'nly Stars more straying: The Sphears distun'd. These are the last, last Times; Where Vertue failes, where Vice preuails and climes; Where good Men melt away; Vngodly harden. How many Flowres (the choise of all our Garden) Of either Sex, of euery Age, and Rank: From euery Quarter, Border, Bed, and Bank [Besides that paire of Royall Sister-buds, Whose life had promisd Europe many Goods: Beside That Prime-Rose, Miracle of Princes, VVhose Herse as yet a Sea of Tears berinses: Besides that knot of Noblest Harringtons, Th'old Father's Honors doubling in the Sons: Besides Godolphin, Bodley, Muses Father; Rare Sackvil's-Neuil (new Minerua, rather): Besides Saint Drvry, Sidney's-Rutland, Cheiney, Mirror of Dames, and other VVorthies many] Hath Our Great Husband lately snatched hence, Before his Wrath's approching Storm commence? Why wail'st thou then My happy Dissolution, By Natures Current and Heav'ns Constitution? Repell thy Sorrowes: and repeale to Thee All actiue Vertues. Mourn no more for Mee. I liued long enough; sith while I liued Thou louedst me: but (so should I haue grieued) Hadst thou appear'd vnkinde vnto thy Wife, My longer Date had bin a shorter Life. I leaue thee Babes ynow; A Sonne and Daughter: Ynow to craue thy care, and cause thee laughter: Ynow for Thee; ynow for Mee to beare: Which oft I wisht: And the Almighties Eare (Who hear's his Owne, and on them ay bestoweth Their owne desires; or what Hee better knoweth) Heard me in This; and One Petition more; That, when Wee parted, I might passe before. So, fare thou well (Deer Heart) farewell: my leasure Serues now no longer for this last best pleasure. Farewell, deer Pheer: Farewell, deer Father too. This is my last Will, which I leaue with You. You, ioynt Executors I haue ordained: And for an Helpe, My Mothers loue vnfained As Ouer-seer I beseech you call: And for your Counsaile vse our heau'nly HALL. So, in the heau'ns, among my Ioies supernall; So, in my Glasse, the Vision of th'Eternal; If I shall see You, in your Pilgrimage, O! bee it happy, as my Hopes presage. So, in our Children, as their Yeers be growing, May Natures Gifts and Heauenly Grace be flowing. One haue I heer; Two haue You there below: We heer haue Peace, You there haue Wars (we know) With-out, with-in: the more therefore behoues-you Defence from Hence. So wishes She that loues you. So, graunt me God (if it be lawfull heer) I neuer lose remembrance of my Dear: So, calmed be the Tempest of Your mourning For My Decease (according to my warning). So, casting of this Load of Heauiness, Our Loue vnceasing, may Your Sorrow cease. So ceast the Voice, and so the Shadow Vanisht. The Mourners then, more rauisht then astonisht, Did still, still, listen with a longing Eare For more such Musik: which then missing there (Me thought) the Sable Curtaines back they haled. And, looking round, were ready to haue called; When instantly their Passions so abound, That downe they sink; and as they sink they swound: Where-at, I (grieu'd to see such Friends berest me) Starting to help, disturbed Morpheus left me: But, as he rouz'd by chance he cast a Quill, For present Pen to copie HONOR's Will. Honours Epitaph. Heer-vnder, lies The Wonder of her Kinde: The rarest Work Of Nature and of Grace: A beautious Temple Of a bountious Minde; Where Venus, Iuno, Pallas, had their Place. Nay; Heav'ns and Natures Gift, singled to Many, Heer All concurr'd To Honor Hay and Denny. To my Reverend Friend, M? Doctour Hall. None should, but Thou, This Ladies death bee grieving; None knew so well the Vertues of her life: Death's robd of Her Death, by Thy labours rife: By Thee, is Shee in Heav'n and Earth still living: In Heav'n, by hearing and (through Thee) beleeving Th'eternall Word; which taught her holy strife 'Gainst Hell and Sin, and (as becoms a Wife) Peace with her Spouse, him due Obedience giving: In Earth, for acting (in so gracious measure) The twice-preacht Lectures of thy Life and Tongue; Alms, Meeknes, Mildeness (towards Old and Yong) Forgiving Wrongs, forgetting all Displeasure. O happy Seed that fell in such a ground! And happy Soil that such a Seed-man found. I. S. A FVNERAL ELEGIE To my Reverend Friend, M. D. Hill: Jn pious memory of that worthy Matrone, his right vertuous and religious Wife, Margarite Wyts (late Widow of the reverend D?. Hadrianvs Saravia) Deceased. All, that in all this wide World is inclos'd, Is of Two Kindes (and divers, too) compos'd: Mortall, the one; Immortall, th'other sort, Exempt from Death (which spilleth worldlings sport) And vnto each a diverse place is given. Th'one droops on Earth: the other dwels in Heav'n. For, all, above bright Cynthia's silver Car, Lives out of fear, from Death and danger far: Far from corruption, and as free from Change, Self-stable ever, never selfly-strange: Never transform'd, nor trans-substantiate: Sith, neither subject to the power of Fate, Neither obnoxious to those cumbers rife, Cares, snares, and surfaits, that doo combat Life: And, all, beneath her many-formed flame, That sojourns heer amid this fickle Frame (Whether, the winged Myriades of the sky, Whether, the Millions of the Ocean's fry, Whether, the Legions in the woods and groves, Of savage heards, or of domestick droves) All, all, doo dy: All are to Death inthrall'd: And, for their dying, are heer Mortall call'd. But, chiefly Man, though in his better part, Most like to God, in This, most like to smart: So that his Reason (though divine-inspir'd) Seems over-rated, or too-dear acquir'd. Yet, if kinde Nature nobly had decreed, By certain and irrevocable Deed, None but the vicious and the lend to dy (The Vertuous living heer eternally) There were som comfort in Man's wretched case: And Nature then might hold a Mothers place. But, when wee see the Wicked (for the most) Live long and lusty, ruling all the roast, Though never turning or returning quick (As Swine, or Dogs) their vomit to re-lick: While (for the most) the Godly soon are gon, Or daily going, deadly laid vpon By humane malice, or som hand divine: O! flesh and blood, how can it, not repine? Alas! To see a goodly field of Wheat All burnt with lightning, or with hail-stones beat (When the full Ears, humbling their flowry top, Were even as ready, with a gratefull crop, To thank the Husband for his taken toil, His cost and care, his sweat, his seed, and soil:) While safe the Tares Cockle and Darnell rest, With Thorns and Thistles that the Corn opprest: O! Who so constant, but would grieve, and grudge (If not a Christian) at th'All-ordering Iudge; And wag his head at Heav'n (weak earthly worm!) Against the Author of that angry storm? Such is thy case: Such was thy heavy cross, To lose thy gold, when others kept their dross: To have thy vessell, full of vertues, split; Where lighter Keels, and empty, never hit: To bee bereft so sweet, so sainct a Wise; While heer bee left Harpies, and Hells of life. But, I have learn'd; and thou hast taught (my Hill) VVee must content vs with our Makers will; The Rule of Right, disposing all that is: And ordering all things to the good of his. So, for Her good (thy good) was His good pleasure, To snatch so soon thy Margarite hence, thy Treasure, Thy Pearl (indeed, the Iewell of her kinde, For worth and wealth of body and of minde) Tri'd in her cradle, train'd from tendrest youth Vnder the Cross, for CHRIST's eternall Truth: Forsaking Gaunt for th'holy Gospels sake; Lands, goods and air, which Nature dear doth make: Fleeing from Antwerp (in poor Beggers weed) The Spanish fury, in a fearfull need, Wish her dear Parents tossed to and fro, Right noble Parents, partners in her wo. Her April past, her Summer-age prepares, If much lesse dangers, not much lesser cares; In House-hold charge, vnder her Virgin-sway, Her puisne Orphan-sisters to defray. For, her owne Father, Nature had vn-hous'd: And Metkerk had her Mother re-espous'd (Renown'd Sir Adolph, of whose noble stuff, Little is nothing; and much, not enough, To bee recorded: But, his stile and state, Learn of S. Butolph, neerest Aldersgate) And, Hee releast, and Shee deceast soon after, Most worthy Mother, of so worthy Daughter. Religious Lady, leaving by her Wil, Charge to her children, to persever still In Truth's profession; and Heer rather rest, Though poor and mean; then, to bee re-possest, Return to Flanders (on the best condition) To bee replung'd in Romish superstition. And well her Will her valiant Sons observ'd, Both Seriant Maiors (as both well deserv'd, In Faiths Defence, by wounds yet healed scarce) To both those brave Nassauvian sons of Mars: So did the rest: but best my Margarite, Executrix (her yeers and vertues right) All which shee past, and with so pure report Fitting the mirror of her sex and sort: Such exercise of every House-wifes part, Such honest shift, such thrift, such vse, such art: Such modesty, such gravity, such grace, Such speech, such silence (suiting time and place): Such due devotion, such discretion seen, As seemed neerer sixty then sixteen. How well, and worthy of her former fames, Shee did demean her with two noble Dames, In honour'd service (many yeers with Each:) With praise and love, without the least impeach: Palavicine, and Hastings will auouch (Though now new-nam'd: that Cromwel, &amp; this Zouch So vertuous both, that (for so long together) None but so vertuous could haue serued Either. Such was her Minor-age: such Mayden-life: Such Woman-state: and such shee was a Wise To (My) SARAVIA; to whose reverend Name Mine owes the honour of du-BARTAS fame. For, (as our London (else for drought vndon) Sucks from the Paps (the Pipes) of Middleton, (Whose memory mine never shall forget, But to Hugh's name adde the sur-name of Great, For his great Work) abundant streams to drench, Cool, cleanse and clear: and fearful flames to quench.) From th'ample Cisterns of his Sea of skill, Suckt I (my Succour) my short shallow Rill: The little All I can (and all I could In three poor years, at three times three years old.) His love and labour apted so my wit, That when Vrania after rapted it, Through Heav'ns strong working, weaknes did produce Leaves of delight, and fruits of sacred vse: Which, had my Muse t'our either Athens flowne, Or follow'd him, had been much more mine owne, Then was the fault that so it fell not out. (But prais'd bee God, who pleas'd to bring about His better will, to better mine: lest I, Too-puft with knowledge, should bee huft too-hie.) Howbeit, Him needs must I honour much: And Her for him, and for Herself: sith such (When such so few, in such an Age as this: So foul, so false, so full of vanities) So milde a Childe, so meek a Servant, rather: So loving Nurse to one, less Pheer then Father (So weak and wayward thorough Ache and Age, As still in Patience steept her Pilgrimage:) O, happy Hee! so, happy Shee, the while: Till Hee, more happy, left Her Widow's stile. Whenceforth, sequestred from all publike sight, From all occasions that might move Delight: As hearty sorry as in habite sad, Tears in her eyes, Sighes in her brest shee had (As grieved Turtle on the green-less Spray Grones, and bemones her, in a Mournfull Lay) Lamenting many Months in heavy Cheer Her Loss (alas!) Her loving Father-Pheer: Resolved chastly, not to change her Life, Her Widow-state, to bee a stately Wife: Still keeping home; still tasked, sober-wise, In Huswifes Vse, or holy exercise. Or, if at length shee looked out of Door, 'T was but to visit som weak, aged Poor; Som wofull Woman, or som wretched wight, Through som disaster, in som wofull plight: Som long-sick Neighbour, or som needy Soule, With timely Comforts of her Bag or Boule: Or, on the Sabbaths, or the Lecture-Daies, To hear, and learn, to read, and pray, and praise. Such was thy Marg'rite, morally divine; Maid, Widow, Wife (Hill) til Thou hadst her Thine. This, I record: to Thee belongs the rest: If heer I ly, doo thou deny my Test, Or testifie vnder thy hand with Mee, That Such Shee was, and Such Shee was to Thee: And, to that end, insert Thy Paragraph Before, or after, her sad Epitaph. Or, if Thy Grief as Yet permit thee Not, Make Mee thy Proxie: for, right wel I wot, Will-nill thou, Hill, Thou canst not but aver, That Such Shee was as I have vouched Her: And Such to Thee, well witness't by her Will, Bequeathing All to her dear D?. Hill: And more then so, by a dear Mother's Smart, Thy glad-sad Partner in a dead-live Part (Her first and last) vnhappy-happy Boy, Which cost her life, and Thee thy Life's best Ioy. Such then Shee liv'd and dy'd: for, such must dy: Yet such shall live, heer, and eternally. So Shee; so Shee (though sudden from thee took) Shall live, with Thee, in this thy living Book. To Gods Glory. IN PIOVS MEMORY OF the nobly vertuous and religious Matrone, Margarite, Wife of Robert Hill, D?. of Divinity, and Pastor of this Parish. Heer lies a Margarite, that the most excell'd, (Her Father Wyts, her Mother Lichterveld, Rematcht with Metkerk) of remark for birth, But much more gentle for her genuine worth: Wyts (rarest) Iewell (so her name bespeaks) Vertues bright Load-starre, to enlight her Sex In pious, prudent, peace-full, praise-full life, Fitting a SARA, and a Sacred's Wife, Such as SARAVIA, and (her second) HIL, Whose ioy of life, Death in her Death did kill.

Loquitur post funera virtus. From my sad cradle to my sable chest, Poor Pilgrim I did finde few months of rest. In Flanders, Holland, Zeland, England, all, To parents, troubles; and to mee did fall. These made mee pious, patient, modest, wise: And, though well born, to shun the Gallants guise. But now I rest: my soule where rest is found; My body heer in a small piece of ground. And from my Hill, that Hill I have ascended, From whence for mee my Saviour once descended. Live yee to learn, that dy you must, And after com to iudgement iust. Maritus mœstissimus. Thy rest gives mee a restless life, Because thou wert a matchless wife: But yet I rest in hope to see That day of Christ, and then see Thee. Margarita a Iewell. I, like a iewell tost by Sea and Land, Am bought by him who wears mee on his hand. Margarita, Margareta. One night, two dreams made two propheticals: Thine, of thy Coffin; mine, of thy Fune rals. If women all were like to Thee, Wee men for wives should happy bee. R.H. Margarita surrept' est, mons exaruit. FINIS. A Brief Catechism. The Preface. Q. Know'st thou, my Childe, wherfore thou wast created? A. Sir, to serve God, who mee and all created. Q. How ought wee him to serve and to adore? A. The Summe thereof consisteth in these foure. Q. Which foure bee they? A. Faith, and obedient Living After Gods Law, with Praier and Thanksgiving. Q. Of each of these apart, and (orderly) First, of the first let mee examine thee. 1. Of Faith. Q. In whom hast thou thy Faith's affiance founded? A. In God alone my trust is wholly grounded. Q. Why? A. God the Father made mee first of nought, And God the Son redeem'd mee worse then nought, God th'Holy Ghost (my Guide and Consolation) Instructs, conducts mee to Sanctification. Q. Are th'Holy Ghost, the Father and the Son, Three gods? A. No; Persons three, God onely one. 2. Of Obedience. Q. Will God bee served after the Commission Of his owne word, or after Mans tradition? A. Doubtless, according to his owne behest, And not the motions of mans brain or brest. Q. But, of thy self canst thou accomplish fully The Law of God? canst thou perform it wholly? A. No, God doth knowe. Q. Who doth it then in thee? A. The Holy Ghost begetting Faith in mee. Q. Having (within) the Spirit for thy direction, Canst thou perform obedience, in perfection? A. No, neither yet. Q. Yet God rejecteth all That perfectly keep not his Law in all. A. 'Tis very true. Q. How then, or by what action, Canst thou please God, give the Law satisfaction, Or scape that Death which to damnation brings? A. By Iesus Christ, and by his sufferings. Q. How so? A. Why thus: Christ our high-priest for ever, Self-offring once to bee re-offred never, Hath pleas'd his Father, hath appeas'd our strife, And by his Death purchast vs endless life; So that, by lively Faith to vs applying Th'one Sacrifice of Christ our Saviour dying, By imputation w'have his righteousnes, As Ours, with God; and thereby life and peace. 3. Of Praier. Q. Whom prai'st thou to? A. To the true God (of powr And will to help) who hears vs every hour. Q. But in whose name will hee bee call'd vpon? A. Onely in Christ's, our Saviour and his Son, Our Price, our Peace, our Reconciliation, Our Advocate of much commiseration, Sole Mediatour of Mankinde; who needs No Aid of Saints, or any that succeeds. 4. Of Thanksgiving. Q. While Christ, our King, our Prophet, Priest, and Preacher, Converst with his Disciples, as a Teacher; Tell mee, I pray, how many Sacraments Did hee ordain his Church for evidence? A. Two. Q. Which are they? A. Baptism, and the Supper Which hee assign'd the night yer hee did suffer. Q. Of Sacraments what end, what vse have wee? A. Signes to our Sense, seals to our Faith they bee. Of Baptism. Q. What is it that is signifi'd vnto vs In sacred Baptism? A. It betokens to vs Full pardon and remission of our sins, And a new birth, where better Life begins. Q. But in whose name is Baptism to bee giv'n? A. In th'onely Name of th'one-three God of Heav'n; The Father, Son and Holy Ghost: to whom Be praise alwaies beyond all time to come. Of the Lords Supper. Q. What's signifi'd vnto vs and presented In th'Holy Supper? A. There is represented The true Communion of Christs Bodie and Blood Giuen for, and to vs, for immortall food: Whereby our soules are fed in expectation Of Life eternall purchast by his passion. Q. When wee receive these Mysteries Divine, What's showne vnto vs by the Bread and Wine? A. These Elements, before vs lively figure Of Christ his Death the virtue and the vigor. For, as our bodies by the staff of Bread, And cheer-heart Wine, are strengthned heer, and fed: Even so his Body and his Blood doo nourish Our Faith-mouth'd Soules, that they may never perish. Q. But, is Christ present in the Sacrament? A. Yea: and his Flesh hee doth vs there present. Q. How meanest thou, that the substantiall Essence (After a reall and a carnall presence) Of Christ his Body, in the Bread is closed; And, of his Blood within the Wine inclosed? A. No; nothing less. Q. Then plainly let mee knowe Where wee may finde him. A. Not in Earth belowe; But, in Heav'ns glory, with his glorious Sire: Whence, hee shall com, to judge the World, in Fire. Q. But, to climb Heav'n, what Ladder can suffize vs? A. Faith. Q. Then wee must beleeve, ere yee advize vs Vnto this Feast for faithfull ones ordain'd. A. So it behooves. Q. But, how is Faith attain'd? A. Faith coms by hearing; when the Holy Spirit Works with the word, and in vs doth aver-it; Confirming vs in all the promises Which in his Gospell Christ hath made to his. The Praier. Q. O Gracious GOD, that grant'st the just Desires Of Soules whose zeal to thee by Faith aspires: Sith onely those doo worthily receive The Sacred, Supper which thy Son did leave; Who first by Faith, with strict examination, Doo sound themselves by vpright conversation: Give vs the grace, so to examine (then) Our Faith and Life as appertains. A. AMEN. FINIS. SPECTACLES New-New Polished Perspective SPECTACLES of Especial Vse, To discern THE WORLDS Vanite, Levite and Brevite These Glasses in indifferent Lights Serue Old, &amp; yong, &amp; midle Sights. 1 Sol, Annus, Stellæ. When wee can stop th'accustomed Career Of Heav'ns bright Champion, mounted on the Dawn: When Wee can cease the Circuit of the Yeer, Whose winged Car, by Months, Daies, Hours, is drawn: When Wee can stint the Wandring Armies cleer, Which march above (in Blew-Gold-tinseld Lawn) Tilting at Ours Their many-pointed Eies: Then may Wee stay the World's Inconstancies. 2 Orbis Cœli &amp; Terræ. Who will not wonder, looking-vp, to see The moving Heav'ns set, certain, Constancy; When, looking-down, in Earth vnmov'd and stable, Hee nothing findes but vainly variable? What lives on Earth, what-so partakes of Clay, Is frail and mortall; hath no Rest nor Stay: Heav'ns rest-less roule; yet in the Heav'ns ther dwells An end-less Rest, and Life that life excells. 3 Quatuor Elementa. Fire, Air, Earth, Water, warring Each with Other, Turn and return them one into another; As pleas'd th'All-Maker in This All dispose Th'accorded Discords of these Friendly-Foes: To shew, that Wee should for our Blisse repair Else-where then where is Earth, Fire, Water, Air; And that Our Rest rests in a Place far higher Then Earth, or Water, or the Air, or Fier. 4 Mare. Is Ought more fierce, more furious to withstand, Then stormy Billows of the raging Sea? Is Ought more feeble then the flitting Sand? Yet doth the Sand the swelling Ocean stay. O! then, how fiercer! O! how furious more Is th'aw-less Storm of Man's Concupiscence! Which so transports him, that no Sand, no Shore, No Bank, no Bound, can stop his Violence. 5 Fontes et Flumina. You silver Brooks, cleer Rivers, crystall Fountains, Whose smooth swift-sliding pase Still, still roules down apace; Say, why so long you drive through Vales and Mountains? To shew Thee, that thy Life (in This Theater) Flees from thee as the Water: And, that thy Soverain Bliss Abides not Heer; where nought abiding is. 6 Dies. When the Day (the Sun's bright Son) New-awake, begins discover Mountain-Tops new-gilded-over, With his ruddy Raies thereon: That (mee thinks) should make vs think On that true eternall Morning, When no Night shall bee returning, When both Heav'n and Earth shall shrink. 7 Nox. When the Night's black Curtain, spread, Hides the Day, and Light bereaveth; Then, my wakening Thought conceiveth Other Night, more dark, more dread: There where Worldlings, wilfull-blinde, Loath Instruction, leave Light's Mirror, Double-nighted in dark Error; Self put-outing Light of Minde. 8 Ver. When youthfull Spring the Earth in green hath drest, When Trees with Leaves and Blossoms them re-vest; Their Flowers (white, red, blew, yellow) Betoken Fruit to follow. But, Worldlings, though they flourish in their Prime, Nor bud, nor bear, nor bring-forth Fruit, in time: Their Health, Wealth, Wit, mis-wasted, Are but as Blossoms blasted. 9 Æstas. When Summer's Heat hath don his Part, The Husband hath a gladsom heart; Sith golden Threasures of the Plains Make large Amends for all his Pains. But, th'idle Lubber, labour-loathing, Walking, talking, wishing Store; Sowing Nought, but Winde, before; Shall, but Winde behinde, reap Nothing. 10 Autumnus. When the Leaves in Autumn wither, With a tawny tanned Face Warpt and wrinkled-vp together, Th'Yeers late Beauty to disgrace: There thy Life's Glass maist thou finde-thee, Green now, gray now, gon anon; Leaving (Worldling) of thine Owne, Neither Fruit, nor Leaf behinde-thee. 11 Hyems. When chill Winter's cheer wee see Shrinking, shaking, shivering Cold; See Our Selves: for, Such are Wee After Youth, if ever Old. After Winter, Spring (in order) Coms again: but, Earthly Thing, Rotting Heer, not rooting further, Can Thy Winter hope a Spring? 12 Quinque Sensus. How swift is Beauty vanisht from thine Ey! How sudden Musick drowned in thine Ear! How soon doo Odours from thy Nostrils fly! How short, touch-Pleasures (tipt with Pain and Fear)!) How sowre, Taste-sweetest, in small time's expense-is! Then, Epicure, well may wee blame thee, since, All vnder Sense thus vain, Thou hast no sense Of Vanity, which so besots thy Senses. 13 Vita &amp; Mors. Worldlings that live in State, and dy in Strife, Wretched their Death, and wretched is their Life. For, their Life kils them, keeps them fetter'd in The Chains of Death, the Cage and Wage of Sin. Their Death is double; termin'd and eternall: So much more deadly as it dyeth not. For Errors, Terrors heer; there, Torments hot: Their Life, a Death; their Death, a Life infernall. 14 Eccho. What is the World, but a vain Eccho's Sounding, From Woods, and Caves, and hollow Rocks rebounding? A new No-noise, a dead-live Voice, to summon Deluded Ears to listen to a Dumb-one: A speaking Fiction of a mocking Faëry: A formall Answer, in Effect but aiëry? Hence, hence, vain Eccho, with thine idle Mocks: Keep in thy Woods, sleep in thy Caves and Rocks. 15 Incarceratus &amp; Mendicus. As a close Prisoner, in dark Durance chained, Dreams that hee walks, runs, ranges, at his will: As a poor Begger, with sharp hunger pained, Dreams that hee eats, and yet is empty still: So, the World's Captives, sleeping heer securely, Dream them the Freest, in their deepest Thrall; Dream them abounding, seeming Lords of all: Yet still are Beggers, and still Prisoners surely. 16 Fumus &amp; Aura, convivium. The Worldling feeds his greedy Minde With golden Hopes of high Conceipts (As vain and void as Smoak and Winde) Which prove in fine but fine Deceipts; Yet keenly set his Teeth on Edge. No Mervail though: for, hee must needs Bee ever light, that ever feeds On Winde and Smoak (and Chaff and Sedge). 17 Cupido &amp; Timor, constitutum. Desire and Fear the Worldling ever martyrs, Still double-racked with Two divers Tortures: Desire's a Fire, running through all his Bones, Which dries him, fries him, and his Rest bereaves: His Fear's a Frost, chilling his hart at-once, Killing his Hopes, spilling the Webs hee weaves: So that, distract with Fear and with Desire, In Frost hee fries, and freezes in the Fire. 18 Ambitio, Luxus, Avaritia. Ambition, Luxe, and Avarice, Three Witches (Ladies, I should say) whom the World doth woo With sute and service (and that slavish too) For their three Daughters, Honour, Pleasure, Riches, Serve All alike: th'Ambitious, but with Winde: With Woes, the Wanton (after Shewes of Mirth): The Avaricious, with som Crums of Earth; Ever the less, the more hee sets his Minde. 19 Avis &amp; Navis. As in the Air th'high-soaring Ægle scuds: As on the Water slides the winged Ship: So flees, so flits, the Wealth of worldly Goods; So swift away doth wanton Pleasure slip. And, as wee cannot, in the Air or Water, See the Ships furrow, nor the Ægles footing: When Wealth is past, and Pleasure poasted after; To track their Trace, nor is, nor can bee booting. 20 Fratres in Malo. Th'Ambitious alwaies doth aloft aspite; Honour on Honour striving still to heap: The Avaritious sloopeth his Desire, From vnder ground his Golden Crop to reap. Th'One tendeth vpward, th'Other downward tends; As if at Ods, and vtterly Contrary: Yet, though they seem, indeed they doo not vary; But mean to meet together in their Ends. 21 Væ vobis. Who but hath heard Both bitterly deplore Their dismall Fortune, and disastrous Fate? O! cries th'Ambitious, I have lost my State: O! th'Avaritious, I have lost my Store. Why cry you out on Wracks, and Rocks, and Shelves, And Wars, and Wiles, that have your States vndon? Rather complain, rather cry-out, vpon Your Goods and Greatnes, where you lost your Selves. 22 Punctus non dividendus. Is Heav'n a Circle, and is Earth the Centre So small a Point (as Sages oft have showne)? Why then, fond Mortals dare you Battell venture, Who the most part of so small Point shall owne? Why, silly Worldlings, doo you toil you so, Train'd with false Hopes of your too-fond Ambition? O! dangerous Error is it, not to knowe 'Tis vain to strain about a Point's Partition. 23 Onus cuique suum. Sure, Avarice is an extreme Disease; So is Ambition an extreme Vexation: Yet shall wee finde, survaying Both of These, That Eithers Self bears his Owne several Passion. But, th'egre Fit, the Force, the Frenzy (rather) Mis-called Love (dead-Living, merry Sadnes) Of One same Sicknes makes Two sick together; And Two at-once mad of One very Madnes. 24 Dulce venenum, vel sibi lædens. Why wail'st Thou, Fondling? and why weep you, Fair? Sighing your Soules into the sense-less Air? Blame but your Selves: Desire is your Disease: Your Pain proceeds from what your Selves doth please. Your chief Content is in your Torment's top: Your most Delight is in your most Diseasing: You drink you drunk in the sweet-bitter Cup, Which sowres your Ioies, and makes Annoies as pleasing. 25 Aquæ, Sagittæ, Venti. Swiftly, Water sweepeth by: Swifter, winged Arrows fly: Swiftest yet, the Winde that passes, When the neather clouds it chases. But, the Ioies of Earthly Mindes, Worldly Pleasures, vain Delights, Far out-swift far sudden flights, Waters, Arrows, and the Windes. 26 [In constant Country, Thou maist Witnes bee] In constant Country, Thou maist Witnes bee, The World hath nought but vain Inconstancy. Thy Peace for War, thy War for Peace; thou takest: Thou doubtfull floatest on vncertain Waves: Thou ween'st, thy slaughter thee from Shambles saves: Thy most Despight thy most Delight thou makest. Th'hast nothing fixed, nothing firm, in Thee; Nor constant Ought, but thine Inconstancy. 27 Mundus qualis. What is the World? tell, Worldling (if thou knowe-it) If it bee good, why doo all Ills o'r-flowe-it? If it bee bad, why dost thou like it so? If it bee sweet, how coms it bitter then? If it bee bitter, what bewitcheth men? If it bee Friend, why kils it (as a Foe) Vain-minded Men that ouer-love and lust-it? If it bee Foe, Fondling, how dar'st thou trust-it? 28 Aura, Flos, Vnda. World's best Beauty Self-defaces, Sooner then the Puff that passes: Sooner then the fragrant Flowr, Blowne and mowne within an Howr: Sooner then a Wave (that follows) His owne Predecessor swallows. O! what is then then the World wee have? Alas! a Blast, a Bloom, a Wave. 29 Quam malë conveniunt! More eas'ly far may Wee Make Black and White, And Day and Night, In one same Term agree: And rather (rarely-od) Wed Fire and Water; Death and Nature: Than with the World match GOD. 30 Emblema. Friend Faber, cast mee a round hollow Ball Blown ful of Wind (for Emblem of this All): Adorn it fair, and flourish every part With Flowrs and Fruits, with Brooks, Beasts, Fish &amp; Fowl; With rarest Cunning of thy curious Art: And grave in Gold, about my silver Bowl, Thus roules the World (the Idol of Mankinde) Whose Fruit is Fiction; whose Foundation, Winde. 31 Glacies. Ice is fair, and shines externall; Fair and shining th'All-Theater: From the Ice they fall in Water; From the World to Death eternall. Both at last shall vanish: Ice Into Water shall re-solve; All the World (and all his Vice) Into Nothing shall dissolve. 32 Rome (Conquerer) conquered. The Stranger, wondring, stalks, and stares-vpon Rome's antique Glories, in her Ruines seen: Hee sees high Archs, huge shining Heaps of Stone, Maim'd, mutil'd, murder'd, by yeers wasteful Teene Hee sees a rugged, ragged, rocky Quar Hang in the Air, with Ivie laç't about. O! what can last, alas! (then cries hee out) Sith Time hath conquer'd the World's Conquerer? 33 Arbor. The World's a Tree (in my Conceit) The Arms wide-spread, the Body great, The Root deep-reaching, nie to Hell: The Leaves fresh varnisht lively green, The Blossoms various to bee seen: The Fruit doth suit the rest right well: The Flowr it bears, Som Beauty call; Hony the Fruit; indeed, but Gall. 34 Hortus. The World's a Garden; Pleasures are the Flowers; Of fairest hues, in form and number many: The Lilly (first) pure-whitest Flowr of any, Rose sweetest rare, with Pinked-Gillie-Flowrs: The Violet, and double Mari-Gold, And Pansie too: but, after all Mischances, Death's Winter coms; and kils, with sudden Cold, Rose, Lilly, Violet, Mari-Gold, Pink, Panses. 35 Avaritia, Invidia. Never have, and ever crave, Are the Worldlings thoughts intire: Honour, Wealth; the more they have, More they covet, more aspire. They never doo enjoy their Owne, But Other's wish, like, love, admire: And having All, yet have they None; For, after All, they more desire. 36 Scientia &amp; Ignorantia. In Heav'ns sweet Language have I learn'd yer This, That to the Wise the world's as Night to Morning; As Deaw to Sun; as Cloud to Noon-sted is: For, vertuous Knowledge, in his brest bright-burning, Is Morning, Sun and Noon: but, Ignorance Is th'vgly Night; Pleasures, the vading Deaw; Cloud Vanity, which doth our Soules pursue, Till Vertues Raies infuse their Radiance. 37 Bona cur Mala. Antiquity, O! why didst Thou devise This name of Goods vnto these worldly Riches! Sith th'are (alas!) but Evils (Pains or Pitches) To silly men that doo them over-prize. Rather, ô Worldling, why dost thou misuse them? Why dost thou wrong Vertues good Instruments? Goods (Ills to those that doo them ill dispense) Sith Goods are Goods to those that rightly vse them. 38 Quatuor Monarchiæ. The Babylonian, with ambitious fist, First the grand Sceptre of the World possest: The Persian, Him; The Grecian, Him dismist: Him, th'awfull Roman after dispossest: And Him, his Owne Waight let not long subsist; Him, his Owne Greatnes ruin'd with the rest. Who then (alas!) this Fall of Monarchs seeing, Can hope in Earth for an eternall Beeing? 39 Glacies. Hee that makes the World his Nest, Settling heer his onely Rest; Never craving other Scope, Never having higher Hope: What thinks (think you) such a One? Thus: To sit secure vpon A Ball of Ice, a slippery Bowl, Which on the Seas doth ever roule. 40 Diruit Edificans. When-as the Worldling moils, and toiles, and tires, Incessantly to heave-vp Wealth on Wealth, Pleasure on Pleasure, Stile on Stile; by stealth, To reach the Top of his too-vain Desires: When, the more loaden, the less Waight he feeleth, Plotting his Ease i'th'Pain hee doth pursue-in: When Hoord on Hoord, when Heap on Heap he hilleth, What doth hee else but build himself his Ruine? 41 Bellum cum vitijs. One-Day I saw the World in furious Fight With lovely Vertue, his most loathed Foe: It dared her, shee bravely did defie't: It entred Lists (Shee first had entred though): It traverses, it toils, it heaws, it hacks; But all in vain, his blowes com never nigh-her: For, the World's Weapons were but lythie Wax, And Vertue's Shield is of celestiall Fier. 42 Naufragium. Thou, thou, whose heart dives in the World so deep, Seest thou thy Case? know'st thou thy own Condition? Like head-less Bark tost 'twixt the Opposition Of blustring Storms which every way doo sweep. Reason, thy Rudder, is already lacking: The Gales of Pleasure, and the Gusts of Passion, Hurry thee headlong in the Gulf of Fashion, On Rocks of Death thy wretched Life soon wracking. 43 Mors in Olla. VVhere's Death? I'th'VVorld. VVhere is the VVorld? In Death: Death to it Self: for, nothing in the VVorld Kills and confounds the VVorld, more than the VVorld; VVhich breeds, and feeds, and giveth Life to Death. But, from the VVorld could God's Love wean the VVorld, Killing the VVorld's Love, and his Issue, Death; Then happy wee should triumph over Death; The VVorld not worldly; Death dead in the VVorld. 44 Somnium. I sawe, I sawe, the VVorld was but a Dream, When Heav'ns shrill Voice had rouz'd and rais'd my eies: For, in the VVorld I found but Lies; Eies clos'd, Ears stopt, Mindes inly toil'd extream; All Dark, all Night: Man out of Man (in Cumber) Himself with Fumes and Phant'sies feeding, Not feeling Pains, nor Passions heeding; Loth to bee waked from so sweet a Slumber. 45 Quasi non vtens. O! happy Hee can bee so highly wise, As not to knowe the vain and vitious Pleasures The Vitious take (when they will take their leasures) VVhich so besot their Soules, and blinde their Eies. O! happy Hee that can disdain and deem Those Pleasures, Poisons; and that Hony, Gall. But, who can so? Hee that, contemning All, Lives in the VVorld, and not the VVorld in Him. 46 Monstrum horrendum. VVhat Monster's that which hath so many Heads; So many Ears, so many Eies between; So lively clad before in lusty Green; So black behinde, in cloudy Cloak of Shreds; His feet so sliding down a round steep Hill; Rouled by Time, which turns it swift away; Death, running after, shooteth at it still? Ah! now I see. What is't? The World, I say. 47 Sordescit &amp; Surdescit. Stay, Worldling, stay: Whither-away so fast? Hark, hark awhile to Vertue's Counsels Current. No, no: alas! after the World, in haste, Hee hies, flies, follows: as a rapid Torrent Too-proudly swelling with som fresh Supply Of liquid Silver from the Welkin gushing, My warning (as a Rock) hee rouleth by With roaring Murmur, sudden over-rushing. 48 Sufficit Vnum. 'T was a loud Lie (think I) a very Slander, Th'Ancients ascribe t'ambitious Alexander, Weeping for wo there were no mo Worlds made. Suffiz'd not One, so busie and so bad? If true it were, Great Monarch, cease to mourn; And give Mee leave: O! let Me weep my Turn; Who strain and strive, yet cannot all my Care All Vanities of this One World declare. 49 Variabile. Vary, re-vary; tune, and tune again (Anon to This String, and anon to That; Base, Trebble, Tenor; swift, slowe, sharp and flat) Thy One same Subject in a sundry Strain; To represent, by thy so divers Ditties, The dying World's so divers Alterations: Yet will the World have still mo Variations; And, past thy Verse, thy various Subject yet-is. 50 'T is but Vanity and Folly, On the World to settle wholly. All the Ioies of all this Life Are but Toyes, Annoyes and Strife. O God! onely wise and stable, To establish Mee in Thee, Give mee, Thou that art All-able, Wisdom with true Constancy. FINIS. MOTTOES. [The highest Rocks and Hils] The highest Rocks and Hils, Which seem the Clouds to threaten, With roughest Storms are beaten: The lofty Cedar feels The Lightnings Flash and Thunder: So Gods Almighty hand Soon from aloft brings vnder The Proudest that withstand. [What's the Wisdom of Mankinde?] What's the Wisdom of Mankinde? What the Works of hand or minde? What the Vertues of the Rarest? What is all our Best and Fairest, Void of Cstrist? Alas! a Grave, Dungeon, Den or dreadfull Cave, Lin'd with Winde, with Shades, with Vapors, Set on fire with deadly Tapers. [Where, where are now the great Reports] Where, where are now the great Reports Of those huge haughty Earth-born Giants? Where are the lofty Towrs and Forts Of those proud Kings bade Heav'n Defiance? When Them I to my Minde revoke, Mee thinks I see a mighty Smoke Trick-mounting from quick-burning Matter. Which in an instant VVindes doo scatter. [Go, silly VVorms, drudge, trudge and travell] Go, silly VVorms, drudge, trudge and travell, Lespising Pain; So Thou maist gain Som Honour, or som Golden Gravell: But Death the while (to fill his number) VVith sudden Call Takes thee from All, To prove thy Daies but Dream and Slumber. [Art Thou, Man, no more now mindefull] Art Thou, Man, no more now mindefull Of thy Childe-hood, brute and blindefull? Dost thon laugh, and dost thou sing Th'Errors of thy Youth and Folly? Canst thou bee so blithe and iolly, Towards Age now galloping? Rather wail thy Life's Condition, Thrall to Sin, Death and Perdition. [I saw a childe with slender pipe of stubble] I saw a childe with slender pipe of stubble (From hollow shell with Soap and Water mixt) Against a Wall to blowe-vp many a Bubble; Where many an Ey of many by was fixt: For, rich they seem'd, and firm round Form did render. But, when I saw them (and that suddenly) Break at the Best; behould a Type, said I, Of World's vain glory, and soon-vading splendor. [When I read, when I contemple] When I read, when I contemple, Th'estate of that happy Temple Christ hath planted heer belowe Amid this World; and grafied so On Durt, in danger of the Divell; Sad and glad at-once I am: I imbrace and chase the Evill: Heav'n I shun, yet seek the same. [The World is full of Wrong and yet is serv'd too-well] The World is full of Wrong and yet is serv'd too-well: 'Tis too-well follow'd too, and yet a Tyrant fell: 'T's an vgly Monster-most, and yet the Most contenteth: 'Tis on the Death-bed laid, and yet of Life it vanteth: 'Tis Sorrow, Shame and Losse, and yet is most approved: 'Tis nothing but a Crosse, and yet is best beloved: 'Tis seeking Peace in VVar; choaks whom it seems to cherish: 'Tis hating Heav'n, for Earth; and it in Hell shall perish. [This World is a Galley fraighted] This World is a Galley fraighted With mis-haps (or Haps mis-treated) Sliding on a sea of Care. Tears and Fears her Sailers are: Will, her Pilot (still at Stern, all): Strong Desires, her Windes (for most): Bitter-sweet, her Course and Coast: And her Hav'n is Death eternall. [What's the World's Progress? what our Gifts, heer living?] What's the World's Progress? what our Gifts, heer living? But a foul way, all full of Baulks and Sloughs: (A foolish Coach-man, false and dangerous, Through thick and thin our old weak Chariot driving) A smoaky Lodging, stinking, nastie-most: A greedy, needy, churlish, filthy Hoste: A stony Bed, a strange vnquiet Slumber: Awaakt with Lies, Pride, Perill, and Incumber. [Monarch's greatest Greatnes heer] Monarch's greatest Greatnes heer, Nobles noblest Ranks and Races, Worthies Tropheis, passing peer; Sages Worth, for Wisdom cleer; Time (alas!) and Death defaces. Why then fix wee heer our Eies On this glimpse that sudden passes? Rather rear them to the Skies. [Why, why should I the World bee minding] Why, why should I the World bee minding, Therein a World of Evils finding? Then farwell, World: farwell thy Iarres, Thy Toies, thy Toies, thy Wiles, thy Wars. Truth sounds Retreat: I am not for-ye. Th'Eternall draws to him my heart By Faith (which can thy Force subvert) To crown mee (after Grace) with Glory. [What Beautie's This, so brave bedeckt in Riches?] What Beautie's This, so brave bedeckt in Riches? Whose wanton Looks, whose waving Locks and Song, As with a Dart, a Chain, a Charm (too-strong) Self-blindes, self-bindes, and self it self bewitches? O! 'tis the World t'a Courtisan transformed, VVho pranks and paints her Body round about: But all this Beauty onely is without, And cannot hide the Soule, within, deformed. [The World and Flesh combin'd with Death and Sin] The World and Flesh combin'd with Death and Sin, Against th'immortall Soule were privie-banding; Selfe Traitor Nature had even let them in; Had not the Faith for Sentinell bin standing; Who, by the the Cross, did Sin, Flesh, VVorld subdew: VVhereby, the Soule re-heartened and revived, Led by her Head, pursewd the Fight and slew, Slew Death, which sought Her Life to have deprived. [Death's dead indeed, the World yet is not] Death's dead indeed, the World yet is not; But yet, yet rules the World about; Of Earth's Affront no more in doubt: Sith her heer fighting more it sees not. For, Faith hath now in Heav'n her Station, Forth of the World; disdaining heer To see her Seat vsurpt so neer By Error and Equivocation. [Why? why build Worlds their Hopes Assurance] Why? why build Worlds their Hopes Assurance On this vain Worlds vnduring Durance? Sith all the Sweet of worldly Pleasures, Worldly Honours, worldly Threasures, Is Nothing but a Blast, a Breath, An addle Hope, an idle Dreaming, A sudden Storm with fury streaming, And drowning all in Gulf of Death. [The World's a Drumm, with loud Alarum stirring] The World's a Drumm, with loud Alarum stirring The World to War; and too-too-cruel spurring Son against Sire. The Means if you would finde, 'Tis by a Mean that is but made of Winde. But tell mee World, How coms a simple Sound Sext but from Skins, vpon a Skin but beating, T'incite thee so, so to be stir thee round To face thy Force, thy Faces Force so threating? [Why sleest thou, World? Alas! to seek Assurance.] Why sleest thou, World? Alas! to seek Assurance. Where to bee found, if in the World it fail? There where the World doth not the World assail. Why? doth the World cause to it self Ill-durance? Yes; too-too much: for, in Fire, Air, Earth, Water, The World self-drowns, self-burns, self-hangs self-slaies. Flee then to Heav'n. Fond Hee that Anchor laies In th'Euripus of This vain World's Theater. [Friend Larkin, if the World you figure] Friend Larkin, if the World you figure, You must not draw it round of Figure: For, Sage should the compleat Round In every part is perfect found. So never can this VVorld bee; seeing There wants the Chief, The chiefest Good: And Nothing there (right vnderstood) But Nothing hath (inconstant) Beeing. [Sooner shall all the Heav'ns bright Eies] Sooner shall all the Heav'ns bright Eies Cease their set Courses in the Skies: Sooner shall the Ocean Have no more Motion: Sooner them worldly mindes remooved From vain Deceits Of Earthly Baits, By VVorldlings heer too-deer-beloved. [The World and Death one day them cross-disguised] The World and Death one day them cross-disguised To cosen Man (when Sin had once beguil'd him) Both cald him forth; and questioning advised To say, whose servant hee would fainly yeeld him. Man, weening then but to the World t'have given-him, By the false World becam the Slave of Death: But, from their fraud Hee did appeal by Faith To HIM, whose Death kild death, and hence hath driven-him. [The World's Session, or Assize] The World's Session, or Assize: The Counseller is Arrogancy: Sin the Sollicitor (feed by Fancy) Th'Attourney is but vain Surmise: Remorse is Marshall: Conscience, Crier: Death sits as Iudge in dreadfull room; Pronouncing for a final Doom, The Sentence of eternall fire. [You tanned Tiphyes, whom Gain's love bewitches] You tanned Tiphyes, whom Gain's love bewitches, From Inde to Inde, and from the North to Nile, To sound new seas, to seek new shores, the While Your Life's best Hope but in a Plank and Pitch-is. What Pilot have you but your Passion, still? Your Rudder, Avarice; your Mast, Ambition; Your Sails, but Priae; which Furies Puffs doo fill: What think you then to gain, but deep Perdition? [This World is but a Pilgrimaging] This World is but a Pilgrimaging, Where wicked men, most felly raging, Doo trudge and travell most devout: But, from the right way wandring out, They headlong fall in Pit of Terror, The Gulf of Death. But, O my God, Guiding my steps in better Road, Draw mee to Thee from worldlings Error. Finis. An Appendix. Although thou canst not write so rare a Ditty, Nor sing so sweetly, bee thou vertuous though: For, dooing well is more then saying so: And, to bee Wise, is more then to bee Witty. The Vertuous, reading and recording sweet These sacred Songs, is cheered in his Courses: The Vitious, reading, singing, rather worse is: Rapt with the Sound; not with the Sense, awhit. Surcease thy Musick lay aside thy Muses: Paschal and Pibrac yon have toild too-long: Seeing that Vertue serves but for a Song To this vain World, that on all Mischief muses. Lo, heer in Paper is poor Vertue painted: Alas, dead Vertue! Thus these Times doo vse-thee: Yet, if all hands, yet if all hearts refuse-thee, Remain Thou ever in these Songs imprinted. As fiercest Lion, freiting in his Cage, Is somtimes calmed with harmonious sounding Of Lyrike Strings, and made to leave his Rage, Let go his Prey, and fall to Dance-like bounding: So, the vain World, in Pangs and Passions flinging, Charm'd (as it were) and bound with seventy Chains, It's Fits and Phansies, for a while, refrains; Heer, to it Self, it Selfe's Inconstance singing. FINIS. THE WOOD-MANS BEAR. A Poeme By Iosvah Sylvester. Semel insanivimus Omnes. To the VVorshipfull, his most approoved Friend, M. Robert Nicolson. Sir, the kinde Welcom that you alwaies daign To the fair Muses, and their favorites; And chiefly mee, the meanest of their train (Too mean to meddle with their sacred rites) My willing heart with thankfull hand invites To offer you my busie-idle pain, Ill-shapen shadows of my young delights, Till better fruits my better Fates ordain. Yet (pray-you) private let this Iigg bee kept; Vnworthy Object for judicious Eies: Which, but for you, eternally had slept; And, but to you, from hence-forth ever dies: But, lack of better forç't mee, for a shift, To bring you now this old-new New-yeers Gift. Semper Arcto-philos. TO HIS DIVINE ARC TO A her devout Arctophilos. Because I count a promise debt (my Dear) Especially vnto a speciall friend, This promis'd pledge to your sweet self I send A gloomy glasse of your perfections cleer: A pour traiture resembling nothing neer Your heavenly features, that in worth extend Beyond the reach of my poor rymes Commend, As in this plot I make to plain appear. Yet since for you amid my dumps I drew-it, And since your self have since desir'd to see-it; VVith milde aspect vouchsafe (bright-star) to view-it. To doom whereof in your discretion bee-it: But deem withall, that in this bitter story I grave my griefs, and not your beauties glory. Vincenti gloria Victi. THE WOOD-MANS BEAR. 1 Seventy nine score yeers and seven Were expired from the birth Of a Babe begot by Heaven, To bring Peace vnto the Earth; Peace that passeth all esteeming, Sin-bound soules from Hell redeeming. 2 Phœbus in his yeerly race (Having past the Ram and Steer) Now began to poste apace Through the Twins fair houses cleer, Pranking in perfumed robes All these goodly neather Globes. 3 And Aurora, richly dight In an azure mantle fair, Freng'd about with silver bright, Pearl-deaws dropping through the air, Hung the gate with golden tissues, Where Hiperions Chariot issues. 4 At which sight (that all rejoyces) All the cunning Forrest Quier, Tuning loud their little voyces, Warbled who should warble higher: Striving all to bear the Bell (All in vain) from Philomel. 5 When my joyless senses, dulled With the busie toil of Cities, Mee from pensive fancies pulled, To go hear their heavenly ditties: To go hear, and see, and sent, Sounds, sights, savours excellent. 6 Wending then through Lawns and Thickets, Where the fearfull Deer doo brouz, Where the wanton Fawns and Prickets Crop the top of springing boughs: Where the Stag and light-foot Hinde Scud, and skip, and turn, and winde; 7 While I led my wandring feet Through a silent thady Grove, Paved thick with Primrose sweet; As mine eyes about did rove, Neer a spring I chanç't to spy, Where a wretched man didly. 8 Like a Wood-man was his weed: Groveling on the grasse hee lay, Mourning so as doth exceed All That ever I can say. Beasts to bellow, birds to sing, Ceast, to see so strange a thing. 9 Wringing hands, and weeping eyes, Heauie sighs, and hollow groans, Wailing words, and wofull cries, Were the witnes of his Moans; Moans that might with bitter passion Mooue a flinty hearts compassion. 10 Fain would I the cause haue kend, That could cause him so complain: But I feard him to offend With repeating of his pain: Therefore I expected rather From himself the same to gather. 11 Sitting then in shelter shady, To observe and mark his mone, Suddenly I saw a Lady Hasting to him all alone, Clad in Maiden-white and green: Whom I judg'd the Forrest Queen. 12 Who, the eager game pursuing, Lost her Ladies in the chase, Till shee heard the wretches ruing: Vnto whom shee hied apace; Mooving him, with milde intreat, To vnfold his grief so great. 13 When the Queen of Continence, With the musick of her words, Had by sacred influence Charm'd the edge of sorrows swords (Swords that deeper wound have made Then the keen Toledo blade) 14 Fain hee would, and yet hee fainted To vnfold his fatall grief: Passions in his face depainted, Striving whether should bee chief: Thus at last, though loath and sorry, Sigh't hee out his mournfull story. 15 Madam, quoth hee (yet hee knew not What shee was) that you may see, That I cursed causeless rue not, Lend awhile your ear to mee; And you shall perceive the source Whence my cares have had their course. 16 Whence my cares and sad incumbers Have arisen and proceeded: Whose account of countless numbers Hath the Oceans sand exceeded; Whose extreme tormenting smart Passeth all conceit of heart. 17 Thrice-seven Summers I had seen Deckt in Flora's rich aray; And as many Winters keen, Wrapt in suits of silver gray: Yer the Cirian Queens blinde Boy Grudged at my grief-less joy. 18 But when on my maiden chin Mother Nature gan ingender Smooth, soft, golden Doun, and thin Blades of Bever, silk-like slender; Then hee, finding fuell fit, Sought for coals to kindle it. 19 Coals hee found, but found no fire: For, th'East Frisian icy sky Made the sparks of loves desire Sudden born, as soon to dy. Thus, so long as there I bid, All was vain that Venus did. 20 Seeing then that nought might boot, Shee (consulting with her bastard) Bid the busie wanton shoot: But alas he durst not, dastard: In that quarter well he wist Armes to meet with me, he mist. 21 Therefore wearie of his toile, Hopelesse still of better hap, In that so vnpappie soile, Where few Brutes he could entrap; He forsooke the frozen Ems, Soaring towards siluer Thames. 22 On whose lillie-paued banks, Where faire water-nymphs resorted, Plai'd he many wanton pranks, While the silly damzels sported; Wounding with his cruell darts, Their vnwarie tender hearts. 23 Chiefly in my Mother-Towne, Where the Paragon of honor, Vertues praise, and beauties crowne, With sweet Ladies tending on her, Kept her Court in Palace royall, Guarded by attendants loyall. 24 There the Paphian Prince (perceiuing Lords and Ladies, young and old, Apt (through ease) for Loues deceiuing) Sends about his shafts of gold, Striking all, saue her he dares not, Dians selfe: the rest he spares not. 25 Hauing triumpht there a season Ouer all degrees and sexes, Planting loue, supplanting reason, VVhere his darts dire venome vexes: Suddenly he crost the flood, To the famous Seat of Lud. 26 Finding there sufficient fuell, To maintaine his wanton fiers, By and by begins he cruell, To inflame both Sonnes and Siers, Maid and Mistris, Man and Master, Dam and Daughter, light or chaster. 27 Thus he tortures, voide of pitie, Rich and poore, and fond and wise, Through the streets of all the Citie; Causing by his cruelties, Sighing-singing, freezing-frying, Laughing-weeping, liuing-dying. 28 Fates by this time had contriued Causes that me thither drew. Which ere euer I arriued, This detested Tyrant knew: Wyly waiting time and place, To reuenge his old disgrace. 29 Oftentimes he did attempt Euen in streets of second Troy, To haue punisht my contempt, By bereauing freedoms ioy: But vnable there to match me, Else-Where yet he thought to catch-me. 30 I was wont (for my disport) Often in the Summer season, To a Village to resort, Famous for the rathe ripe Peason; Where, beneath a Plumb-tree shade, Many pleasant walks I made. 31 Till a grasse-borne-kricket, mounted On that goodly Trees faire top, Made his fore-fruit (rare accounted) Ouer-soone to fall and drop; Loading euery branch and bow With her brood of krickets now. 32 Hither while I vs'd to haunt, Cupid seeking change of harbor, Leauing stately Troy-nouant, Lighted vnder this fresh Arbor, Neere the howre when Titan wounds vs, Hides our shadowes iust beneath-vs. 33 When the Dwarfling did perceiue me, Me, Loues most rebellious scorner; By some cautel to deceiue me, Skipt he soone into a corner: Where, lest I should spie the Elfe, In a Bear he hid himselfe. 34 Many Beasts, and Birds beside, Adorned with the pride of nature; Faire of feather, rich of hide, Trim of forme, and tall of stature, Vs'd this Orchard to frequent, Till the Summers heat was spent. 35 But the Bear was my betrayer; Nay, she was my liues defender: But she was my freedomes slayer; Nay, she was my thraldomes ender; But she fild my soule with sadnesse; Nay, she turn'd my griefe to gladnesse. 36 Blessed Bear, that bears the bell From the fairest of her kind: Such a Bear as doth excell Those to either Pole assignd: Such a Bear, as 'twould not grieue me, To be Bearward made: belieue me. 37 In a Crofte where Musicks King (Making mends for Daphnes wrong) Made out of the ground to spring Trees transform'd to Daphnes young: In the Crofte so faire and pleasant, Harbor of the Prince-dish Pheasant, 38 Southward was this white Bear bred, Yet not scorcht with Affrick heate; For her Dam had dipt her head In the Crystall waters neat Of a Spring cald Hamberwell, Which can Sun-burnt spots expell: 39 And besides, while young she was, She was carried from that coast. To be taught such practice, as Makes such beasts beloued most, Beast am I to call her beast: Yet indeed a Bear's a beast. 40 Bear in name, but not in nature, Was this much admired creature, Peerlesse piece of perfect stature, Full of all desired feature: Feature such, as all too-faint, My dull pen presumes to paint. 41 Louely Lilly-white she was, Straight proportion'd, stately-pased, Coy, or kind (as came to passe) Curteous-spoken, comely-graced: Graces seem'd of graces lauish, Eyes that gaz'd on her to rauish. 42 Locks like streames of liquid Amber, Smooth downe dangling, seem'd to spred Hangings fit for Beauties chamber, Curtins fit for Beauties bed: Of which slender golden sleaue, Loue his wanton nets did weaue. 43 Fore-head faire as summers face, Built vpon two Ebene Arch's: Vnder which in equall space Stood two bright resplendent sparks; Sparkes excelling, in their shine, Fairest beames of Ericyne. 44 From those Arch's, between these eyes (Eyes that arme Loues Archers tillar) Euen descending did arise, Like a pale Pyramid pillar, That faire double-doored port, Where sweet Zephyr loues to sport. 45 On each side whereof extended Fields, wherein did euer grow Roses, Lillies, Violets blended, Steept in streames of sanguine snow: Red-white hils, and white-red plaines Azure vales, and azure vaines: 46 Vaines, whose saphir seas do slide (Branch-wise winding in and out) With a gentle flowing tide All that Little World about, Vp and downe, aloft and vnder, To fill all this world with wonder. 47 With her mouth I meddle not, Nor with Ecchoes dainty mazes; Lest these, hearing any iot Mis-reported of her prayses In their form, might them incense To reproue my proud offence. 48 But fond he that ouerskips (Fearing fancies Had-I-wist) Those smooth smiling louely lips, Which each other alwaies kist; Sweetly swelling, round like cherries, Fragrant as our garden-berries. 49 Lippes like leaues of Damask Rose, Ioyned iust in equall measure, Which in their sweete folds inclose Plentious store of pretious treasure: Treasures more then may be told; Balme, and Pearles, and purest gold. 50 Balme her breath for so it smelt; Pearles, those pales about the Parke, Where that golden Image dwelt, Her pure tongue that most I marke: Such a tongue, as with my tung Neuer can enough be sung. 51 Now remaines of all his Ile Onely that white Iuorie Ball, Dimpled with a chearefull smile, Which the Cape of Loue I call. Eden was this Iland, Madam: While I gaz'd, mine eye was Adam. 52 Next, her Swan-like necke I saw: Then those spotlesse snowie mountaines, Which when Loues warme Sunne shall thaw, Shall resolue in Nectar fountaines: Twixt which mountaines lies a valley, Like Ioues heauenly milken alley. 53 What my Song should further say, Art enuying my delight (As the night conceales the day) Shrowdes in shadowes from my sight: Art, that addes so much to others, Here a world of beauties smothers. 54 Yet not so, but that I saw, As the Sunne shines through the rack, Smalling downe by measures law, Her straight comely shapen backe: Which though well it liked mee, Least of all I long'd to see. 55 But her slender virgin Waste Made me beare her girdle spight, Which the same by day imbraste, Though it were cast off at night; That I wisht, I dare not say, To be girdle night and day; 56 Lest those hands that here I kisse, As offended therewithall, Rise to chastise mine amisse, Though their rage be rare and small; Yet God shield, her praises singer Should offend her little finger. 57 Yet I feare in much I shall. For, to say her hands are white, Slicke and slender, fingers small, Straight and long; her knockles dight With curled Roses, and her nailes With pearle-muscles shining scales: 58 These are praises great, I grant; But full oft heard I before, Many may like honours vant, Such as these haue many more: Hers are such, as such are none, Saue that hers are such alone. 59 For, if shee had liued, when Proud Arachne was aliue, Pallas had not needed then To come downe with her to striue: Her faire fingers, finely fast, Had Arachnes cunning past. 60 But when to the musicke choice Of those nimble ioynts she marries Th'Eccho of her Angel-voice, Then the praise and prize she carries Both from Orpheus and Amphion, Shaming Lynus and Arion. 61 Here before her nimble feet Fall we flat (mine humble Muse) To endeauour (as is meet) All our errors to excuse: For, these are the beautious bases That support this frame of graces. 62 Now, like as a Princely building, Rare for Modell, rich for matter, Beautified without with guilding, Fond beholders eyes to flatter, It wardly containeth most Both of cunning and of cost: 63 So this frame, in framing which Nature her owne selfe excelled, Though the outward walles were rich, Yet within the same there dwelled Rarest beauties, richest treasures, Chiefe delights, and choicest pleasures. 64 For, within this curious Palace, Mongst the Muses and the Graces, Phebe chaste, and charming Pallas Kept their Courts in sundry places, Lawes of vertue to enactize, There proclaim'd in daily practize. 65 Here the Foster, waxing faint, Looked on the louely Dame, Sighing-saying, Gracious Saint, Heere-hence all my sorrowes came. Lady, pardon, if my song Haue detain'd yee ouer-long. 66 Not your song: your sorrowes seeme Longer then I would (quoth she) Yet, as yet I cannot deeme How your griefes with this agree: For did this faire sight intrap yee, This faire sight might make ye happie. 67 Happie (me vnhappy most) (Then replide he) had I been, Had my life or light been lost Ere my sight that sight had seene: Then had I not liu'de to languish In this ease-lesse end-lesse anguish. 68 But because you doubt (faire Dame) How from such a heauen as this, Full of euery beauties flame, Full of bounty, full of blisse, Full of each delightfull ioy, Could descend the least annoy: 69 If you daigne attend Ile tell (As my feeble tongue will let me) All misfortune that befell, Though the thought thereof doe fret me: Madam, so your kindnes moues me, That to shew you all behoues me. 70 Therefore thinke vpon (I pray) What, when first my tale begun, VVas forespoken to bewray Shifts of Cythereas sonne; How, for feare I should haue spid him, In a Bear the Vrchin hid him. 71 Thence-from, crafty Cupid shot All the arrowes of his quiuer: But my heart, that yeelded not, Made them all in sunder shiuer; Till he, full of shame and sorrow, Better bowe and shafts did borrow. 72 Borrow did he, of that Bear, Armes more apt to work my wo. Stringing with her golden haire Her faire browes, he made his bowe: Whence for shafts he shot likewise Beames of her keene-pearcing eies. 73 Of which Diamond-headed dartes (Beating hard my bosomes Center, Whence resisting power departs, Where but these, none else could enter) Some abiding, som rebounded, Wherewithall the Bear was wounded. 74 Wounded was the gentle Bear, With the weapons that she lent; That she lent (alas) for feare Lest the Loue-God should her shent: So we see, who lend their Armes, Oft procure their proper harmes. 75 So did harmelesse she (alas) That I euer must bemone. Mone I must, for neuer was Marble-hearted Mermydon But would mone, and mourne, and melt, To haue seen the pain she felt. 76 To haue seen her pitious plaining, To haue heard her loud lamenting, To haue thought on her complaining, To imagine her tormenting; Eyes would weep, and eares would wonder, Hardest hart would break in sunder. 77 So mine eyes, mine eares, and heart, Fild with waters, wonders, woes, Drowned, deafened, dead in part, Wel-nigh all their vertues lose: Euery sense, and all my reason Fled, and faild me for a reason. 78 Here when this he had rehearsed, Ere the rufull rest could follow; So the fresh remembrance pearced, That his voice waxt weake and hollow: Bitter teares abundant dropping, Drowned words, their passage stopping. 79 Words were turn'd to sighes and sobbing, Inward griefes did inlie grone: Hopelesse heart with heauie throbbing, Shew'd all signes of saddest mone. Signes made mone, but voice was mum: Small griefes speake, but great are dumb. 80 Woe-begon, and wondrous sorry Was the Goddesse to behold him, Through repeating of his storie In so sad a fit to fold him; Fearing further to prouoke him, Lest new seas of sorrow choke him. 81 For as Sea-coales flame the faster, When we cast cold water on them: Or as Children vnder Master, Mourne the more, the more we mone them: So the more she spake, her speeches More increast his cries and screeches. 82 Yet she would not so forsake him, Lest some sauage hungry beast In this tragick transe should take him, Of his flesh to make a feast: Danger of which dire euent, Thus her pitie did preuent. 83 Loud her bugle Horne she blew, Babbling Eccho voice of vallies, Aierie Elfe, exempt from view, With the Forest musick dallies: Doubling so the curled winde, That the first was hard to finde: 84 Yet her nimble Nymphs, inured Often to the Fairies guile, Could not be so soone allured To ensue her subtle wile: For where first they heard the blast, Thitherward they trip it fast. 85 But because these maids had follow'd Egerly their game together; They when first their Lady halloo'd, Could not by and by be with her: For, before she found the Foster, All her traine (I told ye) lost her. 86 In came these bright beauties than, Where as they their Lady found Standing by this wretched man, That lay there vpon the ground: With which wofull sight amazed, Each on him with wonder gazed. 87 To whom their Goddesse did relate All before that he had told her, All his miserable state: Who did all the while behold her With a heauy halfe shut eye, As a man at point to die. 88 At which the Nymphs with pitie moued, Somewhat to asswage his woe For the Beares sake whom he loued, And that him had loued so, Bad him of their helpe assure him, For they could the Art to cure him. 89 For in a Groue thereby, there grew An hearbe which could loues power expell: Which (but they) none euer knew, As how it prosperd neere a well, Where Diana vs'd to bathe her When the scorching heate did scathe her. 90 Which the Syluans of those Groues Held in very high account: For therewith they cur'd their loues. It was call'd Dianaes Fount: And that Hearb, the pride of Summer, Tooke that speciall vertue from her. 91 And the swiftest of the traine, Away to fetch the same was sent. VVhich her nimble ioynts did straine, And return'd incontinent; And the Simple with her brought, By which the cure was strangely wrought. 92 VVhich vnto the sense applied, As the iuyce thereof he tasted, He might feele euen in that tide How his old remembrance wasted. By the medicine thus reuealed, Was the Wofull Wood-man healed. EPITHALAMION. O you that on the double mountaine dwel, And daily drink of the Castalian Well; If any Muse among your sacred number, Haue power to waken, from a dying slumber, A dull conceit, drown'd in a gulph of griefe, In haplesse ruine, hopelesse of reliefe: Vouchsafe (sweet sisters) to assist me so, That for a time I may forget my woe, Or (at the least) my sad thoughts so beguile, That sighes may sing, and teares themselues may smile, While I in honor of a happy choice, To chearefull Layes tune my lamenting voice; Making the mountaines and the vallies ring, And all the young-men and the maidens sing, All earthly ioyes, and all heauens blisse beside Our ioyfull Bridegroome, and his gentle Bride. Then, peace complaint, and pack thee hence proud sorrow, I must goe bid my merry Greeks good morrowe: Good morrow, Gallants: thus begins our game: What? fast asleepe? fie sluggards, fie for shame, For shame shake off this humor from your eies. You haue ore-slept: 'tis more then time to rise. Behold, already in the ruddy East Bright Ericyna, with the beaming crest Calles vp Aurora and she rose-like blushing, From aged Tythons cold armes, quickly rushing, Opens the wide gates of the welcome day, And with a becke summons the Sunne away: Who quickly mounting on his glistering chaire, Courseth his nimble Coursers through the aire, With swifter pase then when he did pursue The Laurel-changed Nymph that from him flew; Fearing perhaps (as well he might) to misse A rarer obiect, then those loues of his. Such, as at sight (but for the kind respect Of loyall frendship, to a deare elect Child of the Muses) had with hotter fier Inflam'd the wanton Delphian Gods desier, Altars adorn'd with blisse-presaging lights In saffron roabes, and all his solemne rites Thrice-sacred Hymen shall with smiling cheare Vnite, in one, two Turtles louing deare, And chaine with holy charmes their willing hands, Whose harts are linkt in loues eternall bands. Milde vertues mirror, Beauties monument, Adorned with heauens praise, and earths prrfection: Receiue (I pray you) with a brow vnbent, This petty pledge of my poore pure affection, Had I the Indians golden heapes and hoordes, A richer present would I then present you. Now such poore fruites as my bare field affoordes Instead of those, here haue I rudely sent you. Count not the gifts worth, but the giuers will: Oft mighty Princes haue accepted small things; Like as the aire all empty parts doth fill, So perfect frendship doth supply for all things. O be it euer so: so neuer smart Nor teene shall trouble the Soon calm in hart. Mind first your Maker in your dayes of youth: Aske grace of him of him to gouerne well your waies: Reuerence your Husband with vnspotted truth: Take heede of pride, the poison of our daies: Hant not with those that are of light report: Auoid the vile charmes of vnchaste temptation. Neuer lend looke to the lasciuious sort: Impeach not any's honest reputation: Comfort the poore, but not beyond your power: Ouer your houshold haue a needfull care: Lay hold on Times locke, lose not any hower: Spend, but in season; and in season spare: Ofspring, if any heauen vouchsafe to send you, Nurture them godly; and good end attend you. So shall your life in blessings still abound, So from all harme th'almightie hand shall shend you, So with cleare honour shall your head be crownd, So for your virtue shall the wise commend you, So shall you shun vile slanders blasting voice, So shall you long inioy your louing Pheare, So shall you both be blessed in your choice, So to each other be you euer deare. O! be it euer so in euery part, That nought may trouble the Soon calm in hart. FINIS. A HOLY PREPARATION to a ioifull Resurrection. 1 Deare, deare Soule, Awake, awake. Ah! What Answer wilt thou make, When Christ in Glorie shall appeare? When He comes to take Account Of thy Sinnes that hourely mount, By acting, or neglecting heere. 2 Of that irefull Day to come (That red, dreadfull Day of Doome) Th'affrighting Terrour to preuent, Bleeding Teares let heart distill; Right reforme thy crooked will; And speedily Repent, Repent. 3 That, That dreaded Day of Ire, Shall dissolue the World in Fire; As holy Prophets haue foretold. O! What horrour will be then, When the Lord shall come agen, Our deeds of Darknes to vnfold! 4 Shrillest Trumpest thundring sound Through Earth's entrails shall rebound, To summon all before the Throne. Nature, Death, shall stand amaz'd, VVhen the Dead (aliue) be raiz'd, To heare their Iudgement, euery one. 5 Open shall the Bookes be laid, Wherein what we haue mis-said, Mis-done, mis-deem'd, is registred. So that, when the Iudge is set, Closest Crimes (conceal'd as yet) Reueal'd, shall all be punished. 6 Then (Alas!) what shall I say? To what Patron should I pray, Sith the Iustest are not cleare? King, of awfull Maiestie, Health of All that hope on thee, My sauing Health as then appeare. 7 Iesv, Lord, my Sute attend: Oppose thee to th'accusing Fiend; Remembring, once thou cam'st for me, Weary seeking wilfull Losse; Mockt, torne, tortur'd on the Crosse. In vaine these Suffrings may not be. 8 O! Iust Iudge of each Condition, Gratious grant me free Remission: Let not my Workes receiue their Meed. Sighing, I lament my Sin: Teares without, and Feares within. Break not, deare God, this bruized Reed. 9 Marie's Sin Thou didst remitt: Thiefe on Crosse Thou didst acquitt. Like Hope in mee thou dost inspire. For this glorious Grace of Thine, (For no worth or worke of mine) Lord saue me from th'infernall Fire. 10 Point my place, among the Sheepe: Sundred from the Goats me keepe; Disposing me, on thy Right-side: That (the Cursed being cast Into Flames that euer last) I with the Blessed may abide, Full of Ioy, Blisse, endlesse Glorie (Freed of Feare, Griefe, sin-full Folly) Loud-singing Holy, Holy, Holy. Amen. THE MYSTERIE OF MYSTERIES. THREE beare Recorde in Heauen, &amp; These THREE are ONE. 1. Iohn. 5. 7. THE FATHER. Alpha and Omega, God alone: Eloi, My God, the Holy-One; Whose Power is Omnipotence: Whose Wisedome is Omni-science: Whose Being is All Soverain Blisse: Whose Worke Perfection's Fulness is: Vnder All things, not vnder-cast: Ouer All things, not ouer-plaç't: Within All things, not there included: Without All things, not thence excluded: Aboue All, ouer All things raigning; Beneath All, All things aye sustayning: Without All, All conteining sole; Within All, filling-full the Whole: VVithin All, no where comprehended: Without All, no where more extended: Vnder, by nothing ouer-topped: Ouer, by nothing vnder-propped. Vnmov'd, Thou mov'st the VVorld about; Vnplaç't, Within it, or Without: Vnchanged, time-less, Time Thou changest: Th'vnstable, Thou, still stable, rangest. No out-ward Force, nor inward Fate, Can Thy drad Essence alterate: To-day, To-Morrow, Yester-day, With Thee are One, and instant aye, Aye vndivided, ended neuer: To-day, With Thee, indures for-euer. Thou, Father, mad'st This mighty Ball. Of Nothing Thou created'st All, After th'Idea of thy Minde, Conferring Forme to Euery kinde. Thou wert, Thou art, Thou wilt be euen: And Thine Elect, reiectest neuer. THE SONNE. With Father, coeternall Lord, Coequall, consubstantiall Word, His Wisedome, Glory, grauen Feature, Thou Maker, made (for Vs) a Creature, Took'st humane Flesh and Seruants Forme, Man-kinde to ransome and re-forme: Eternitie (in time) began; Immortall, Mortall: God and Man, Man, Godhead's bodily Aboad: One, vnconfounded, Man and God; Not Godhead into Flesh conuerting: Nor Godhead by the Flesh subuerting: Nor by the Godhead Flesh consuming; But, to the Godhead, Flesh assuming. As God, coequall with the Father: As very Man inferiour rather God onely Father, but of Godhead: Mayd onely mother, but of Manhead. In This so sacred secret Band, So Ioyn-distinct Both Natures stand, That Either's What it was before: And both together Somewhat more; One Christ, our only Aduocate (Prince, Prophet, Priest) to mediate; True God, true Man (excepting Sin) Like vs in all without, within: Borne, circumciz'd, baptiz'd, contemn'd, Tempted, tormented, mockt, condemn'd, Crosse-fixed, dead, buried, descended; Arose againe, and then ascended To his bright Throne of Maiesty, At the right hand of God on high: From whence Hee shall returne afresh, Iudge to his Iudge, and to all Flesh. THE HOLY-GHOST. The Comforter, dye Vncreate, Vnmade, Vnborne, Vngenerate, The Father's Equall and the Sonne's, Proceedeth so from Both at-once, That Neither is in Power greater; Neither, in their Condition better: For, What, How-Great, How-Aye They be; As Great, as Lasting, Such, is Hee: Saue (past conceit) all time beforn, Father begat, and Sonne was borne; The Holy-Ghost from Both proceeding: All Three in One, One-Three abiding. Each of the Three is perfect GOD: Yet not Three Gods, but One whole GOD. In this true Onely GOD alone, True Faith beleeueth Three &amp; One: Ascribing, to the Essence Vnitie: And to the Persons onely Trinitie: Whereof (indeed) is None Before Or After Other: Lesse, or More: But Each remaines the Same, vnmixt; So Constant and so euer fixt, That Neither, in it Selfe, Selfe changes Nor into Other it exchanges. This is the Orthodoxall Creed From Heresie and Errour freed: This is the Faith that I professe, Without declining more or lesse. No VVork I plead nor VVorth of mine; But Faith in this Eternall Trine. Lord, I belieue: relieue (my GOD) Mine vnbelief remoue my Load: And let thy Mercies Soueraigne Balme Salue all my Sinnes, my conscience calme.</field>
