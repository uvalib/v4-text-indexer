Through fragrant groves and under cloudless skies The stranger from a northern clime may roam, The loveliness around may charm his eyes, But in his heart he feels, It is not home! And thus the Christian, wheresoe'er on earth His lot may be, however bright and blest, Looks upward to the country of his birth, And longs for heaven, the home of endless rest. Mentone, May 1864. “I MEDITATE IN THE NIGHT WATCHES.” I muse, my Saviour, on the days, Days ne'er forgot by Thee, When walking on these earthly ways, Thou didst remember me. I call to mind Thy prayers upon The hills of Galilee, When, kneeling in the night alone, Thou didst remember me. I see Thee by Thy foes beset In dark Gethsemane, Where, swooning in Thy bloody sweat, Thou didst remember me. Upon the cross I hear Thee cry “'Tis finished,” and I see, In the great woe of Calvary, Thou didst remember me. And though Thou now from earth art gone, By faith I come to Thee, And know that, seated on Thy throne, Thou dost remember me. Thy love my heart will ever guard, Dear will its memory be; This night, and every night, O Lord, I will remember Thee. “FAINT YET PURSUING.” Faint yet pursuing! on they press'd, That chosen band, nor thought of rest, Till their appointed work was done, And Israel's crowning victory won. Faint yet pursuing! let the sign, O soldier of the Cross! be thine; Grave the good legend on thy shield, And bear it thro' the battle-field. Faint yet pursuing! on thy breast Be this unfading seal impress'd, Repeat it to thy latest breath, And thus be faithful unto death. Faint thou may'st be, thy foes are strong, Thy strength is small, thy warfare long, Yet in thy faintness fearless be, For Christ hath won the fight for thee. He bids thee follow where He leads, He gives thee strength for holy deeds,— Then fight, His hand directs the blow, Pursue, His presence daunts the foe. On in thy sacred warfare press, Though faint, droop not for weariness, Fight in the strength that He supplies, Pursue, still looking to the prize. Soon shall thy warfare here be o'er, Thy foes be crush'd to rise no more, Soon thou shalt see thy Captain come To lead His faithful soldiers home. Soon for the sword, He'll give the palm, For battle-shout, the victor's psalm, For faintness, Heaven's refreshing wine, For weary warfare, rest divine. THE HEAVENLY SHEPHERD. Isa. xl. 11. We like sheep had gone astray, In the desert lost our way; Weary, bleeding, bruised, and torn, There we must have died forlorn, Had not Jesus from above Come to seek us in His love. He a Shepherd is so good, For the sheep He shed His blood He so gentle is and mild, That a very little child May look up into His face, Seeing there a smile of grace. Only trust Him, you will find None more faithful, none more kind; He will lead you night and day, Walk before you all the way, Through green meadows guide your feet, And by waters clear and sweet. Heavenly Shepherd, let me be One of those who follow Thee; Let me know Thy pleasant voice, Ever in Thy love rejoice; And when weary let me rest Folded lamb-like on Thy breast. Shepherd of the flock of God! Guide and keep me with Thy rod From the snares that round me lie, From the foes that hover nigh; Guard me with Thy sleepless love Till I reach Thy fold above. THE DOVE AND THE ARK. Swift is thy pinion, Far hast thou flown: Wide thy dominion, Earth is thine own. Long hast thou hover'd O'er the bleak tide, Nowhere discover'd A place to abide. All is so dreary Above and below, Now thou art weary, Where wilt thou go? Wild the waves welter, Night will be dark, Haste thee for shelter,— Flee to the Ark! Sinner despising God and His grace, See the storm rising, Night comes apace. To Christ still a stranger, Wilful and blind, Where, in thy danger, Hope canst thou find? Why shouldst thou wander? Dost thou not see Christ the Ark yonder, Waiting for thee? Thither but venture, Haste thee from doom, Free thou mayst enter, Still there is room! 1861. ['Tis not the way that lay so bright me] “I will bring thee by a way that thou knowest not.” —Isa. xlii. 16. 'Tis not the way that lay so bright me, When youth stood flush'd on Hope's enchanted ground, No cloud in the blue sky then bending o'er me, No desert spot in all the landscape round. Fair visions, glimmering through the distance, beckon'd My buoyant steps along the sunny way, Sweet voices thrill'd me, till I fondly reckon'd That life would be one long, glad summer day. This was the path my feet had gladly taken, And, blindly lured by that deceitful gleam, I would have wander'd on by God forsaken, Till death awoke me from the fatal dream. Alas! in youth by Eden's gate we linger, In its green bowers we fain would make abode, Till the stern angel-warder, with calm finger, Points the feet outward to the desert road. My pleasant path in sudden darkness ended, My footsteps slipp'd, my hopes were well-nigh gone, I could but pray, and as my prayer ascended, Thy face, O Father, through the darkness shone. And by that light I saw the cross of trial, The landmark of the way my Saviour went, The upward path of pain and self-denial, And thou didst point me to the steep ascent. A way I knew not! winding, rough, and thorny, So dark at times that I no path might see, But Thou hast been my guide through all the journey, Its steepness has but made me lean on Thee. And onward still I go in calm assurance That Thou wilt needful help and guidance lend, That strength will come for every day's endurance, Grace all the way and glory at the end. 1859. MOURNER IN THE DUST LOW-LYING. Mourner in the dust low-lying, Longing till the night be o'er, Hark! a voice to thine replying, Bids thee rise and weep no more. Hour by hour, as one forsaken, Thou hast shed thy silent tears; Now thy God bids hope awaken, Thy Redeemer chides thy fears. Long thy weary heart hath number'd All the watches of the night; Long hast thou, while others slumber'd, Trimm'd thy lamp and kept it bright. Now the morning star appearing, Leads the day-spring up the skies; Heavenly hopes thy heart are cheering, Endless glory glads thine eyes. Lo! thy Lord so long departed, Turns thy darkness into day, Comes to heal the broken-hearted, And to wipe thy tears away. Ceased are now thy grief and sighing, Now thine anxious watch is o'er; God's own voice to thine replying, Bids thee rise and weep no more. [The clouds are driven across the skies] The clouds are driven across the skies, But high above them, in the blue, I see the silent stars like eyes Of holy watchers shining through. The cloud has come—the cloud has gone— And gone the shadows cold and gray; But the calm stars are shining on, And keep their everlasting way. So to the pilgrim's eye ye shine, Ye bright realities of heaven; So gleams your clear and radiant sign, Thro' clouds across our pathway driven. Dreary and dark the way would be, And sad the hearts that o'er it roam If in your light we could not see, It is the way that leads us home. [Along a weary way we go] “Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me, My Father, Thou art the guide of my youth?” —Jer. iii. 4. Along a weary way we go, A way we fear to tread, For round it watches many a foe, And many a snare is spread. Unless Thou, Lord, our Leader be, Our feet must wander wide; From this time will we cry to Thee, O Father, be our Guide. Thou Shepherd of the blood-bought sheep, Our fainting steps uphold; Thy tender lambs in safety keep, And bear us to Thy fold. From every danger we are free While following at Thy side; From this time will we cry to Thee, O Saviour be our guide. Each day we see, our souls anew We cast upon Thy care, Each step we take life's journey thro' We ask Thy presence there; Till we the better country see Where all Thy saints abide, Each day we live we'll cry to Thee, O Jesus, be our guide. LAMENT OF DAVID OVER SAUL AND JONATHAN. (Written at the age of 18.) The beauty of Israel lies low on her mountains, And her mighty have fallen no more to arise, The sun of her glory, which late from her fountains Shower'd down his rich brilliance, hath set in her skies. In the temples of Gath tell ye not the sad story, In the wide street of Askelon speak not of Saul; For the daughter of Edom o'er Israel would glory, And the uncircumciséd exult in her fall. On thee, O Gilboa! let no rain, freely falling, Refresh thee by day, and no thick dews by night; For thee may no worshipper come to heaven calling, Nor let the rich incense-cloud curl from thy height. For on thy bloody plains, on that dark day of sorrow, Were the shields of a nation cast basely away; And on that fatal field, ere had dawn'd the bright morrow, Our host's gallant leader all silently lay. Yes! lay still in death, he, the Lord's own anointed, And near him lay resting the son of his pride; Few fled far, 'gainst whom his sharp arrows were pointed, And arm'd squadrons grew pale when his sword left his side. Untrembling they stood while the war-shout was swelling, Like the far-flashing vulture they rushed to the prey, And though all the while their own death-dirge was knelling, They stay'd not their steps till they fell in the fray. When these two princely chieftains our proud armies guided, They were lovely and pleasant all Israel can tell, And that day in their deaths they were still not divided; Together they fought, and together they fell. Like the eagle from far to his quarry swift sweeping, They sped to the onset, nor stay'd in their path; Like the lion aroused, from his lair lightly leaping, They smote each foeman whom they met in their wrath. Weep, then, for the fallen, all Judah's fair daughters! He cloth'd you with scarlet he won from the foe; Oh! weep on our woodlands, and weep by the waters! He who deck'd you with gold and with jewels lies low. Lift ye the loud wailing, for deep on our mountains The warrior is slumbering to waken no more; Oh! let the hot tear, welling forth from its fountains, Flow freely for him whose short life-dream is o'er. For him who was bravest be wildest in wailing, For Jonathan, death for his country who sought; Though his eye, dimm'd with death, saw the foeman prevailing, He sheathed not his sword till he fell where he fought. Very pleasant hast thou been to me, O my brother! Not one know'th how sorely I've wept over thee; I loved thee, my best, as I ne'er loved another, And stronger than woman's love thine was to me. On the soft-speaking harp roll forth the sad numbers; Long shall Judah remember that foul, fatal day; The mighty are sleeping, and deep are their slumbers; Our best and our bravest all fell in the fray! TO THE MEMORY OF SIR WALTER SCOTT. (On the blank leaf of a volume of Scott's Poems, at the same age as the preceding.) Ah! who shall soothly tell thy worth, Sweet wizard-minstrel of the north? What muse shall sing, what tongue proclaim, The praises of thy deathless name? Bright is the wreath of glory bound Thy old and honour'd head around Nor shall its lustre ere be less, As days, and months, and years progress; But each, as silent time flows past, Shall see it brighter than the last. Thy harp is silent now, and mute The whispers of thy breathing lute; For ever hush'd the honey'd tongue, Which, while it moved, so sweetly sung Of noble dame and gallant knight, Of merry dance and hardy fight, Of trumpet-blast and din of arms, And lovely woman's winning charms; Of holy shrine and Gothic hall, And warder on the castle wall, And all the names of high degree Wreath'd in the roll of chivalrie. Though hush'd is now that silver tongue, That music ceased, that harp unstrung; Though o'er that high and haughty brow The thick grave-damps are gathering now; And though the rustling wild flowers wave In fragrance, weeping o'er thy grave, Thy spirit lives among us yet, Thy memory we shall ne'er forget. The voice which cried to thee, Depart! Thrill'd deeply through a nation's heart; Their groans fell on thy closing ear, Their tears dropp'd thickly on thy bier. Thou seem'st to linger sadly still Beside each silver-voicéd rill, To hover o'er each heathery mountain, And haunt each glen and fairy fountain; The beauties which thy master-hand Strew'd thickly o'er thy father-land, Have made thy dear, thy deathless fame, Extend as far as Scotland's name. Though distant may be many a shore To which her sons have wander'd o'er, The land which smiles 'neath northern skies Seems fairer far in all their eyes, Because she gave thy genius birth, Than the most favour'd spot of earth. Their children's children they shall tell To love the land thou lovedst so well, And in their days of weal or woe, On Afric's sand or Lapland's snow, Their hearts shall kindle at the thought That Scotland was the land of Scott! THE JEW'S LAMENT. (Written in Youth.) No more on Judah's hills the song is heard, No more does prophet wake the living lyre, For ever silenced is each holy bard, And gone for ever is their heavenly fire. No more the valiant hero conquering leads Judah's proud sons against their ruthless foes; No more the warrior for his country bleeds, And dies to free her from her many woes. Once did our noble temple proudly rear Its head, beloved by every true-born Jew, Now gilded mosque and minaret appear, Where turban'd Paynims chant their “Allah Hu!” Thine ancient race, Lord, once so highly blest, Has now become the Gentile nation's scorn; And 'midst the taunting heathen sore distressed, We sadly wander, wretched and forlorn. Jehovah, hear us from Thy holy place, No longer may we thus be trodden down; From us no longer hide Thy gracious face, Withdraw from Israel's seed Thy angry frown. TO A FRIEND LEAVING ON A VOYAGE. “When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee.” Go forth upon the lonely sea, No evil can betide, When He who walked on Galilee Goes with thee as thy Guide. Within the hollow of His hand The weltering waters lie; And on the sea, as on the land, He keeps thee in His eye. The friends who love thee for thy weal Will often breathe their prayers; But trust in Him and thou shalt feel A better love than theirs. When they shall watch across the wave Thy gleaming sail grow dim, The thought will cheer them that they gave Thy keeping unto Him. In weakness He will be thy stay, In darkness be thy light; His presence cheer the lonely day, And soothe the sleepless night. Thro' all thy pilgrimage His grace To guide thee will be given; If here thou hast no resting-place, The better home is heaven! FALLEN LEAVES. The dead leaves danced about the tree That shiver'd as the wind blew chill, “Come back, my children, come back to me;” But the minstrel wind piped wild and shrill, And the leaves whistled round in frantic glee, And sang in their dance, “We are free, we are free!” “Come back, my children, the boughs are bare, Where you whisper'd and play'd the summer long, With each wandering wind high up in the air, And wove green bowers for the birds of song!” But the dead leaves whirl'd around the tree, And sang as they danced, “We are free, we are free!” In a lull of the wind came a plaintive sigh, “In the days that are past ye were bound in one To the same deep root. But now ye lie Fallen and faded and loosely blown, By the wind that sports with you for a day, And will tire of you soon and fling you away! “Ye are free no more—ye are shiver'd and sere; Soak'd with the rain and gnaw'd by the cold, Ye shall wither away ere spring be here, And be trodden down and raked in the mould; But young green leaves shall come back to the tree, And sing in the wind, ‘We are free, we are free!’” December 1862. LINES ON ELIZA COOTER, A BLIND AND DEAF MUTE. It seemed to me a mournful sight That little room at first reveal'd, A child whose eyes were closed in night, Her lips in hopeless silence seal'd. Chain'd down by weakness to her bed, Her tender frame by suffering wrung,— “A bitter lot is thine,” I said, “A heavy cross for one so young!” But, oh! far otherwise I mused, When once I saw with glad surprise, How this meek lamb, so sorely bruised, To the Good Shepherd raised her eyes, How patient on His breast she lay, And kiss'd the hand of chastening love, And bless'd the dark and rugged way That led her to His fold above! Sweet child, so greatly tried and blest, Thou soon wilt lay thy burden down; The rougher road, the happier rest, The heavier cross, the brighter crown. For days of darkness yet to thee Shall everlasting light be given; And the first face that thou shalt see Will be thy Saviour's face in heaven. That fetter'd tongue, here mute so long, Shall burst its bonds in sudden praise; Its first glad words will be the song Which round the throne the ransom'd raise. From sufferings freed and free from sin, And in unclouded light to shine,— If faith can such a triumph win, Sweet child, a blessed lot is thine! Family Treasury, 1859. THE CHARGE OF THE SEVEN HUNDRED. They flung their hearts forward At the bugle's stern breath, Seven hundred cavaliers Riding proudly to death; In the strength of dear honour Their sabres they drew, And went on with no armour But good hearts and true. They saw the red match By each black-throated gun, They knew that the foemen Were a hundred to one, But in grand consecration, And breathing calm breath, Our seven hundred cavaliers Rode proudly to death. The battle coil'd round them The drift of its smoke, Like a red streak of flame Through the whirlwind they broke. They felt their blood tingle With immortal desire, And grasp'd wildly at glory Through the tempest of fire. Ye earn'd it, brave hearts, Each man as ye fell Clenching fast the good weapon That won it so well. Alas! that our best blood Should pour forth like rain, To cleanse the bright honour Which never knew stain. Sleep, last-born of glory, Sleep well with your fame, On the pillar of story Ye have carved a deep name,— Half sadness—half gladness— Song's life-giving breath Hails the seven hundred cavaliers Who rode proudly to death. THE DAUGHTER OF JEPHTHAH TO HER FATHER. My father! tears are in thine eye, Thy manly bosom heaves with sadness, O why should household agony Profane the day of Israel's gladness? Let not one thought of me alloy The festive time with fruitless sorrow; Be this a day of sacred joy, And think of me, and weep to-morrow! I came to meet thee with my peers, Our timbrels rang to choral dances, I saw afar the gleam of spears, And sought thee out with anxious glances. And soon I found thee, but thy brow Grew dark to thy beloved's greeting, I knew not then, as now I know, What made it such a mournful meeting. Alas! I then had little thought That meeting was our life-long parting— That nature's love, which in me wrought That impulse, passionately starting, Had stung my father's heart with pain, Had made him curse his bitter error,— Yet were it all to do again, My love would overcome my terror. Now time is fading from my view— Slow opens death its gloomy portal; I mourn not that my days are few,— For on me breaks a light immortal,— I grieve that thou art left alone, That through these darkening years another Must do for thee what I had done, And she no daughter of my mother. O lay me where—beside the palm In yonder vale—my mother sleepeth, Where, blowing from the groves of balm, The evening wind so softly creepeth. And thou wilt sometimes, with a sigh, Remember her who loved thee dearly; What quench'd the brightness of her eye, And made her sun go down so early. I go, a virgin sacrifice, To stand before Death's purple altar: And bind no fillet round mine eyes, Though thou must strike, I will not falter; The blood that fills my veins is thine, And I were not my father's daughter Did I not make his honour mine, And pour it on the earth like water! TYRE. Thy waters, Tyre, once hail'd thee queen, A crown was on thy brow, On every sea thy ships were seen— Where is thy glory now? Where once thou wast in splendour set, Thy place is known no more, And the poor fisher spreads his net Upon thy silent shore. Yet in thy silence we may hear A warning sent abroad, And on thy shatter'd rocks see clear The fingers-marks of God. On us has dawn'd a glorious light, Which never shone on thee; May we to those who dwell in night Its willing heralds be. May our swift ships of Tarshish bear The gospel o'er the wave, Till every land and people hear That Jesus died to save. NINEVEH. Rise up, long buried city! rise, The wondrous tale unfold, Bring up again before our eyes The pride and pomp of old. Throw off the mask that hid thy face, Throw back the funeral pall; That by thy grave we may retrace Thy glory and thy fall. That in the desert we may hear Another voice, anew Proclaim to every careless ear The Word of God is true! Like Jonah preach, and from the tomb Thy voice of warning send; Tell men that sin is mark'd for doom, And must in ruin end. And tell each fearful heart, the Lord Is true and faithful still, And will each promise of His word As righteously fulfil! THE CHERRY TREE. (From the German. 1860.) To His servant Spring, the good God said, “For the poor little worm a table spread!” Straight on the cherry-tree there were seen Thousands of leaflets fresh and green. The poor little worm woke up, and crept From the cell where all winter long it had slept; It rubb'd its eyes in a dreamy mood, And open'd its little mouth for food. And with slow, silent tooth it gnaw'd away The little green leaflets on many a spray, And it said to itself, “This is very good,— 'Tis quite a feast on such delicate food!” To His servant Summer, the good God said, “For the poor little bee a table spread!” Straight the tree all over was bright With thousands of blossoms fresh and white. Soon as the morning redden'd the east, The little bee flew from his hive to the feast, And humm'd to himself, “This is pleasant juice,— Can such nice little china cups be for my use? “So clean and so white the cups are, let me dip My tongue into each, and the sweet juice sip!” So from cup to cup he flutters and drinks. “This year there is no want of sugar,” he thinks. Then to Summer the good God said, “For the poor little bird a table spread!” Straight for each blossom came fruit instead, Thousands of cherries so fresh and red. The wren and the sparrow then flew to the tree, Each chirrup'd and said, “Is this meant for me? Here let us feast the whole summer long, And our throats will be clear and sweet for song!” Then to Autumn the good God said, “Clear the table—the children have fed!” Quickly a cold wind blew from the hill, And its breath was hoar-frost, dank, and chill. And the leaves turn'd yellow, and red, and brown, At each breath of the breeze they came rustling down; What had come from earth return'd to earth, And died on the bosom that gave it birth. Last to Winter the good God said, “Over all that is left a mantle spread!” Quickly the snow-flakes began to fall, Wrapping them up in a close, white pall. BETHLEHEM. O happy place that heard the voice Of angels singing sweet; That saw the star which sages led To the Redeemer's feet; That held the lowly dwelling where The heavenly Child was born, And saw the shepherds worship there Upon that wondrous morn! Oh may my heart, Lord, through Thy grace, A little Bethlehem be! Though it should know no other guest, May there be room for Thee! Its door would open to Thy knock,— Come in, Thou blessed One! Abide with me, and dwell in me, And make me Thine alone. I have no gold, nor frankincense, Nor fragrant myrrh to bring; My love is all I have to give, Accept the offering! A REMINISCENCE. (Suggested by a scene passed on his journey to Edinburgh in May 1863. Written at Mentone, 1864.) It was a singular fancy That flash'd on my mind to-day, As through the fair shifting landscape I was whirled on the iron way. Fringed with green rushes and lilies, With no ripple to fret its flow, A river sail'd on through broad meadows, All bright with a vernal glow. The meadows sloped gently downwards To the river's clear brimming tide, Overwaved with sweet May blossom A hedgerow skirted its side, And knee-deep in the rich pasture The white kine wander'd at will, Or couch'd beneath an old elm-tree, Where the shadows were cool and still. A picture so bright and so peaceful, So touch'd with a pastoral grace, The spirit of some old Greek idyl Seemed to breathe in the silent place. Far over the sunny meadows A gloomy oak-forest cast A broad black belt of shadow From an immemorial past. And dimly seen over its umbrage Rose a castle moulder'd and gray, Its walls and its turrets embattled Still standing the siege of decay; The hold of some grim old baron, In the stormy feudal years, Who oft through its portals had sallied With a clash and glitter of spears. And sudden there came the impression, As I gazed on this tranquil scene, That here, at some time dim-remember'd, Like a former life, I had been. Methought that before my glances A familiar vision did pass, The reflection of some old picture Still mirror'd in memory's glass. A mood of strange contradiction, When the mind sees things in a trance, And dreams of a former existence Float vaguely before its glance. Now, thus as my mind was divided, I saw two men on the way, The open highway unshadow'd, Which white in the sunshine lay. They came to a stile in the hedgerow Which into the meadows went, And, weary and hot with travel, On its moss-grown bar they leant. They gazed on the soft deep herbage, With a gaze that was long and fond, On the broad, cool, slumb'rous shadow Of the green forest-chase beyond. They felt its subtle attraction, They thought of the dust and heat, And over the stile they clamber'd, And the grass to their tread was sweet. I saw them go slowly onwards To the ancient and solemn wood, I saw the gray walls and turrets That in mystical stillness stood. And I thought, these twain are pilgrims, Who to the far city fare, They have stray'd from the path, and yonder Is the hold of Giant Despair. Then I knew that oft in my boyhood, On a calm bright Sabbath tide, In these fair meadows I wander'd With Bunyan as my guide. THE FIRST HYACINTH. No sign was in the hard dry root Of treasures at its heart conceal'd, No promise gave the slender shoot Of the rich blossom it would yield. And, as we watch'd from day to day The stalk unfold in winter glooms, We little thought it would display This coronal of clustering blooms. By slow degrees, sweet flower, thou hast Unto thy perfect beauty come; We gave thee shelter from the blast, Thou bringest summer to our home. So meek and white in virgin grace, So sweetly scenting all the air, Surely the first of all thy race In Eden did not blow more fair. Yet on thy loveliness full blown, We gaze with something like a sigh, To think the bloom one day has shown, Must in another droop and die. Is not the bud that hopes to bloom, Though slowly opening in the shade, More happy than the flower whose doom Is in the sun to stand and fade? Is it not better to aspire And rise still higher than before, Than to be all that we desire, And feel that we can be no more? No! lovely flower, thou art content Thy law of being to fulfil, For the brief season thou wert sent, Meekly to do thy Maker's will. Thou hast thy soul of fragrance breathed, Thy stainless bloom hath cheer'd the eye, And with such memories bequeathed, Methinks that thou mayst gladly die. The flowerless season of the year Sweeter and brighter was for thee, And when my life's green leaves are sear, May some one say as much for me! 1862. A THOUGHT ON THE SEA. In that far heaving sea I trace The varied aspect of the sky, It lies reflecting in its face The changeful glance of Heaven's own eye. To-day beneath that genial glance Its waves in azure beauty sleep, Above, below, one calm expanse, Deep calling in a dream to deep. But let the cloudless skies assume A vaporous veil or stormy pall, How soon the shadow and the gloom Would o'er the restless waters fall. So heaven beholds as in a glass Its image stamp'd in light or shade, From smiles to frowns the waters pass True to the signs on high display'd. Oh that my heart thus open lay To influence from the higher sphere, That it would keep from day to day Eternal truths reflected clear. Oh that the sanctities of heaven Would stamp on it their image fair, And visions by the Spirit given, Abide in mild reflection there. That it would only joy when light Dawn'd on it from God's glance benign, And only mourn when from its sight Some cloud had veil'd the sacred sign. LINES. [It is a false and treacherous light] It is a false and treacherous light That shines around us here; The things that glitter in our sight Are not what they appear! Honour is but a wandering breath, And fame is but a gleam; And all remembrance after death A shadow and a dream. The happy life for which we task Our minds from youth to age, Is nothing but a painted mask Upon a hollow stage. And men will urge perpetual strife With Being's highest laws, And spurn the o'erhanging Crown of Life, To rake some paltry straws. How long will men shut out the light That comes too late in death? How long so madly walk by sight, And scorn the voice of Faith? The shapes that hover'd round our way Whilst wandering dimly here, At cockcrow of the eternal day Shall melt and disappear. LINES. [I have loved and woo'd thee long] I have loved and woo'd thee long, Gentle Song! I have felt thy wondrous art Stir my blood and thrill my heart, All my being as a sense Quickening with a life intense; Faintly heard thy silver tone, Seen afar thy starry glances, And my deepest joy has grown From thy whispers and thy fancies. Circling Seasons, Day and Night Bring delight To thy votarist, while he Over nature ranges free. Skies and waters, light and air, All reflect one image fair. But, alas! he shrinks from Life, Walks among the crowd in sadness; Feels his gift, amidst the strife, Oftener link'd with tears than gladness. [At evening time it shall be light] At evening time it shall be light, Though clouds at dawn may swathe the heaven; Though winds and rain, and mist and blight, Across the lowering day be driven. Stand thou unshaken in thy place, And fix thy glance upon the sky, At last a gleam will reach thy face, A heavenly gleam that will not die. LINES. [There is love which springs up in a moment of gladness] (Written in early life.) There is love which springs up in a moment of gladness, That can bloom a short summer, and wither as fast; But the love that has slowly grown strong amidst sadness Is rooted far deeper, and longer will last. In the depth of our spirit that passion we cherish, There it smiles a sweet vision through sunshine and shade— A clear lasting star, its light never shall perish Till the heart that it gladden'd itself has decay'd. Though sad death from the sight the beloved may sever, The heart to its hope is still faithful and true; And the memory of joy that has vanish'd for ever Is dearer than all that allures in the view. That chord in the heart is still mournfully ringing, Though the voice that once thrill'd it for ever is gone,— As the branch that the nightingale perch'd on while singing Will quiver though from it the sweet bird has flown. THE AVE OF SAÔ JORGE. The mountains like eternal ramparts keep Watch round it, in their shadow sunk it lies A little Eden, azure-domed by skies Whose fluent sunlight falls on it like sleep. Birds haunt its delicate air, meadow and steep Are muffled thick with vines; through rents in the green Of chestnut forests, cottages are seen, And upwards thin blue smoke-wreaths slowly creep. Ocean's calm fulfilling waters bound The vale, and chaunt their everlasting psalm, Response eliciting from the entranced shore. Beauty walks here with constant step and calm; Alas! that while its bloom may still be found, The innocence of Eden lives no more! JAAL AND SISERA. “Turn in,” she said, and gently press'd The fainting chief to go; “The heaviest heart forgets in rest Its weariness and woe. For water I will bring thee milk, And soft thy couch will be; The cruel foe shall never know That thou art safe with me!” He turn'd him to the tent and drank, She cast her mantle round His weary limbs, and fast he sank In slumbers on the ground. And then with murder's muffled tread Upon his sleep she stole, Those fingers frail drove deep the nail, And death woke up the soul. So pilgrim! still along thy way The tents of Kedar lie, Beware—they court but to betray, Thou enterest but to die! Though faint and weary do not thou Into their secret come— Seek no repose amidst the foes, And distant from thy home. The angry threat thou mayst despise, But dread the secret wile; For malice masks in flattery's guise, And death can wear a smile. With patient foot and trustful heart, Hold on thy way till even— Sweet is the rest that waits the blest, Upon the hills of heaven! THE NIGHTINGALE. Hark! to the sudden rushes of that flood Of sound that deluges the midnight wood! Hark! to the ravishing falls, the lute-like trills With which the sobbing bird the silence fills! From the sweet tumult of those revelling notes, A wind of wandering music creeps and floats, Far down the dim and starlight-drench'd air, What time the slumbrous heavens are blue and bare! And now it languishes, and now it swells, And now it sinks to deep and sad farewells. Again, with passionate art he doth prolong The rich thick gurgles of his tearful song; Then pours it forth by slowly-trickling drops, Till in a swoon of melody he stops! LINES WRITTEN IN AN ALBUM. No more on earth wilt thou behold the face Which love once lighted with a tender glow; No more be folded in the fond embrace, The fondest and the purest earth can know. 'Twas but a few short years thy childhood knew— What life can know but once—a mother's care, To train for heaven thy nature as it grew, And shield it from the world's ungenial air. Ah! many an anxious thought was hers for thee, Many a strong prayer went up to mercy's throne, In hallow'd moments when she bent the knee, And her meek spirit spoke to God alone. Those lips are silent now, those prayers are o'er, Cold lies the loving heart beneath the sod; But her bright memory lives for evermore To light the path that leads her child to God. True to the dear example she bequeath'd To Him thy young affections upward send; Be this the first fond wish thy spirit breathes, To make her God thy guide, her soul thy friend. Christ's dying eye upon His mother fell, He from His cross to Mary gave a home; Thy mother now doth with the Saviour dwell, And from the throne He bids thee also come. Once for her sake an earthly home was dear, Oh, think that in a fairer home than this Her spirit waits, after brief parting here, To welcome thee to never-ending bliss. SONNET— MENTONE. In dreams of some long-faded loveliness— Half garden and half woodland—have I seen A haunt like this, shut in with closed screen Of foliage,—where the silvery mistiness Of olives fills the wild and sweet recess With tenderest sunlight,—and in air serene The citron glitters, and from thickest green A lone bird's warble breaks the silentness. Guided by thee, my life's own gentle guide, When first within this fragrant shade I stood There seem'd into my inmost soul to glide A blessed peace and health, like cool hand laid On fever'd brow, a thrill of gratitude And joy in this fair world which God hath made. Feb. 5th, 1864. LINES. [Dim were the gray-hair'd minstrel's eyes] Dim were the gray-hair'd minstrel's eyes, His harp was sobbing to the chime Of sadly mingling memories, A tale of ancient time. The rosebud on its stalk may die, Though not unwater'd by the dew, All that on earth delights the eye May fade as quickly too. The bells rang for the bridal night From all the towers of Königstein, The lattice lamps were lit and bright, They twinkled on the Rhine. Guests fill'd the old baronial hall, And loud the shouts of wassail rung, The minstrels all the festival Unto their citterns sung. The old king, with a heart elate, Call'd for a cup to pledge the bride, And glanced with fondness where she sate, With Siegmund by her side. Up sprung the guests through all the hall, And loud the shouts of wassail rung, And clear above the festival The minstrels play'd and sung. She rose, and to the bridal room She pass'd amidst her maidens four; She enter'd in her maiden bloom, But forth came never more! The rosebud on its stalk hath died, Though not unwater'd by the dew,— And she, the prince and people's pride, Hath faded where she grew! TO FLORA. Ah! fondly loved, while thou wert here, Still fondly loved, lamented sore; Thy memory to the heart is dear— Dear till the heart can beat no more. Still we behold thy gentle face, Thy soft blue eyes, thy golden hair, Thine image, in immortal grace, For ever shining bright and fair. The place where thy dear ashes sleep Is far away beyond the wave; No friend is near, no kindred keep Their watch above thy lonely grave. The sun may shine, the rain may fall, The winds around thee make their moan, But thou, the best beloved of all, Art sleeping thy last sleep alone. Yet why should tears bedim our eyes? Why should the heart with grief be riven? 'Tis but thy dust in dust that lies, Thy spirit lives with Christ in heaven. There thou, in spotless innocence, Dost ever on His bosom lie, A lily, early gather'd hence To bloom in climes beyond the sky. Thou wert the sunshine of the home Which is so dark without thee now; But thou to God's own light art come, And angel-lips have kiss'd thy brow. Thy joyous voice once thrill'd the heart, Like music's softest, sweetest tone, Now hush'd on earth, it bears a part In the high anthem round the throne. From all the ills and griefs of time Thou art for ever well away; Thy home is in the cloudless clime, While we in darkness wait for day. And why should sorrow haunt us thus, For one from sorrow ever free? Sweet child, thou wouldst not come to us; Oh, be it ours to go to thee! 1859. WRITTEN AT HASTINGS, 1860. Along the shell fringe of the bay I hear the rippling water's flow, O'er the green waves, in restless play, The lights and shadows come and go. Swift as the ruffling breezes range O'er ocean's wide and clear expanse, Its tints, in wavering interchange, Like gleams of opal flash and glance. But for the clouds that float on high No shifting lights would sparkle there; O'ervaulted by an azure sky The waters were not half so fair. But for the breeze that o'er the deep Goes forth careering wild and free, It would but lie in idle sleep, A glittering, blank monotony. And so, belovèd, 'twere not wise To wish this serious life of ours Could know but calm and sunny skies, And count but bright and smiling hours. So might it run to selfish waste, Worthless, though brilliant it might seem, Its trembling hopes and pleasures based On the duration of a dream. 'Tis change and trial that have power To throw on life a light divine, And make it in its darkest hour With Faith's celestial radiance shine. Let windy storm and tempest blow, Let clouds their frowning shadows cast, If Patience, Love, and Wisdom grow, And Hope gleam brightly to the last. LIFE. Short at the longest, Frail at the strongest, Flame of a taper, Foam of a river, Ocean's weak spray,— Frost-work so brittle, It shrinks from a ray; Breath of a vapour, Seen for a little, Then fading away. Yet, as thou fliest, Bringing from heaven The best and the highest Hopes ever given; Precious thy moments, Rich thy bestowments, Let my hand grasp them, Let my heart clasp them,— And on Time's brink The glory foreseeing, I know life is mine, Immortal, divine, By a gold link That death cannot sever, God to His Being Hath bound mine for ever. 1860. “AARON'S ROD.” On the green parent-tree the dew stood clear In some far moonlit dell; Upon the rod of Aaron, peel'd and sear, That night no dewdrop fell. Once in the sheaf of symbol wands 'twas laid At eve before the ark, Where the pale fire of the Shekinah ray'd A glory through the dark. A sudden thrill of spring-time through it shot, Quick juices swell its core,— 'Tis green as the wet sprig of olive brought To Noah's prison door. Thy hand, O God, around the stem a wreath Of snowy blossom weaves, And clustering almonds in their silken sheath Hang ripe among the leaves. Leafless and dead the rival wands were found When the gray dawning came; That rod alone had bloom'd on holy ground Which bore Thy Aaron's name. So, Lord, I come into Thy holy place, Before Thine ark I lie, A wither'd branch that bears no flower of grace, No fruit to please Thine eye. Hour after hour drags on the weary night, I wait Thy blessed will, That some reviving ray of Thine own light May through my being thrill. Oh, in the night-watch may Thy Spirit's breath My inmost soul pervade! Blow, heavenly wind! dissolve this frost of death In which I am decay'd! Thou, who to the small hyssop gav'st of old Its purifying power, Canst change the poorest weed of earthly mould To a celestial flower. Each germ of evil from my heart root out; Sow there that holy seed Whence the sweet flowers of Christian virtue sprout, And fruits of Christian deed. Thus let me find in Thy pure temple air My time of spring, O God, And in life's darkest night still flourish fair, Like this unwithering rod. Thy sunshine falls on many a fruitless tree; But in affliction's gloom Thy garden plants, O Lord, exhale to Thee Their sweetest scent and bloom. HYMN FOR A NEW YEAR. “Thou shalt remember all the way which the Lord thy God led thee.”— Deut. viii. 2. As on a hill-top gained at last, By many a step, we stand to-day, To look behind us on the past, Before us on o'er our future way. A year of Sabbaths come and gone, Months bright with mercies meet our gaze; Thy hand, O God, hath led us on, Thy goodness claims our song of praise. Within Thy house can we forget Our Father's love, so rich and free? Can we forget the mighty debt, Our Saviour, that we owe to Thee? Oh may the year that now begins, Behold us choose the heavenward way, Redeem the time, forsake our sins, And follow Thee, Lord, day by day. To-day to each the choice is given, How long it may be, who can tell,— On this side lies the bliss of heaven, On that the awful gloom of hell. Jesus, Thy pleading look we see, Thy wounded hands, Thy thorn-wreathed brow— Help us to yield our hearts to Thee,— To yield them all, and yield them now. NEW YEAR'S HYMN. “Thou crownest the year with Thy goodness.” —Ps. lxv. 11. At Thy feet, our God and Father, Who hast bless'd us all our days, We with grateful hearts would gather, To begin the year with praise. Praise for light so brightly shining On our steps from heaven above, Praise for mercies daily twining Round us golden cords of love. Jesus! for Thy love most tender, On the cross for sinners shown, We would praise Thee and surrender All our hearts to be Thine own. With so bless'd a Friend provided, We upon our way would go, Sure of being safely guided, Guarded well from every foe. Every day will be the brighter When Thy gracious face we see, Every burden will be lighter When we know it comes from Thee. Spread Thy love's broad banner o'er us, Give us strength to serve and wait, Till the glory breaks before us Through the City's open gate.</field>
