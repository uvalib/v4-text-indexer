      <field name="fulltext">O how happy a thing it is and ioyfull for to see, Brethren together fast to hold the Band of Amitie. Eu? so the Lord bestoweth on th? his blessings manifold Whose harts and minds without all guile, this knot do keepe and hold. Psal. 133. vers. 1. &amp; vers. 4. To the Right worshipful M. Thomas Smith Esquier chiefe Customer to her Maiestie in the port of London, and to the worshipfull Socyety of Archers, here yearely celebrating the renowmed memory of the magnificent Prince Arthure and his Knightly traine of the Round Table, Grace, Mercy, Peace, and Plenitude of temporall and eternall Beatitude in Christ Iesus our onely Lord and Sauiour, Amen. The Glory of the Rich, Of the Honorable, and of the Pore, is the feare of God. Eccles. 10. A Praise of the Bovve and Commendation of this Booke written by Thomas Churchyard Gent. In forraine land and natiue soyle, where soldiars I haue seen: And chefly in the martial dais (wh? youth was fresh &amp; green) I haue beheld both Bow &amp; shot, the Bow for Archers meet: The shot for vse of powlders force, and lads of liuely spreet. And iudging by experience great, in place where both were tried: I found where shot was graunted good, the Bow was not denied. First ere we found out shot aright, the Bow great battels won: And long the Bow great glory gate, before we knew the Gun. As lo this Booke doth mention make, &amp; shewes in verses good: For murthering shot came in of late, when Bovv in honor stood. In elders daies when manhode shone, as bright as blasing starre, And christian hart and noble mind, disdaind this turkish warre. The Bow was vsed as force of m?, &amp; str?gth of arms might draw To glad the frend and daunt the foe, and hold the world in awe. But wh? that str?gth and courage fail'd, and c?ning crept in place The shot and roring Canon came, stout people to deface. The Bow not fit for cowards hand, for cowards str?gth doth faile: VVhen man drawes a row to the head, and then doth foe assaile. With sword and dagger Lion-like, that bends both brow and taile And grins and gapes with gnashing teeth, to make his enemy quail The shot lies lurking in a hole, and spies aduantage great: Then bullet, match, and powders force, do work a wicked feate. The Archer showes a manly face, in field and euery where: And when his arrowes all are spent, he dies with courage there. The shot no sooner all discharg'd, but legs for life must shift: These bold and venterous nimble bo can find no further drift. But geue the charging horsmen place, the Archers do not so: For foure and twenty headed shafts, belongs to euery Bow. And surely shoote the Archers may, at many a thing ye know. When men in broyles and battailes doubt, how warres and world wil goe. There is a knight a soldiar great, in court doth white staffe beare: That knowes what Bowes haue done in field, against both shielde and speare. Yea many more are yet aliue, that honours Bovv indeed: And can record what noble actes the Bow hath done at need. I saw in sundry soyles my selfe, much shot discharg'd in vaine: Yet gra?t we must that through the same are thousands daily slain But enterlard the shot with Bow, and tel me then your mind: A gallant course of wars vnknown, in field then shal you finde. Fiue thousand Bowes that shooteth still, in Battel may do good: They gall the horse, or kill the man, or draw some desperate blood. And thick as moates in ayer they flee, which hinder much the sight And haply makes when horse is hurt, the mounted man alight. VVel, speak of shot what best you may, the Bovv is braue in field: And sure in skirmish Archers oft, makes feeble shot to yeelde. A rare deuise I will set out, to strengthen Man and Bovv, And when the plaine deuice thereof the world shall see and know. The Bovv shall come againe in fame, and win his wonted grace: Looke out of hand for my discourse, til then come Bovv in place, And take thine Ancient, rowme &amp; vse, as Arthures Knights thee gaue, Thou art a fearfull foe in field, and yet a pastime braue. That brings vp youth, and pleasures age, a noble thing in view An auncient arte, a worthy guise, that scornes all practise new. An exercise that all men loue, an vse of Armes and strength, And to this English soyle of ours, wilt bring great fame at length. So cease I heere, in prayse of Bovv, thinke of me what you please, A longer matter shall I show, before I crosse the Seaes. Finis qd. T. Churchyard. [Amonges praiseworthy Monuments which English Kinges haue made] Amonges praiseworthy Monuments which English Kinges haue made For maintenaunce of Manly acts, whose Fame shall neuer fade, King Henry the 8 hath condigne praise and Princely memory, (For chusing Knights of Arthvres traine to mentaine Archery): Whose Maiesty at Myle end with his NOBLES vsed this game, Anno 1543.

Gods Sainctes do blesse him, and they do His Kingdomes Glory show, And blase his power to cause the Sonnes of men the same to know. Psalm. 145. Vers. 11. &amp; 12. Let Israell reioyce in him, that made him of no thing, And let the Seede of Syon eke bee Ioyfull in their King. Psalm. 149. Vers.. 2. [God the Author of Peace and Loue did so therein delyte] THE FIRST ASSERTION and is Sacred Historicall. God the Author of Peace and Loue did so therein delyte, That of one Man hee Members twaine dyd make &amp; them vnyte: Genes 2 &amp; 3To whom when Children twaine hee gaue, the more to multiply This Peace and Loue, Sathan possest one of them by and by. Cayn it was who did maligne His Brother Habell so, That hee ne ceast by cruell Death this bond to breake in to: Wherefore when hee had issew left, the Lorde of loue decreede, Chap. 4.. Alleij.That Cayns hatred should bee rewed for that his filthy deede. As learned Lyra writes thereon how Lamech old and blinde: With Bow and shafts did walke the woods, some wished pray to finde. His Boy that lead him through the same (as seemed him) espyde Some beast, which nathles Cayn was, where hee himselfe did hyde, Genes 5So that (saith Lyra,) Lamech slew a man there in his wounde: Lo heare was harmles Abels death with his reuenged founde. If Lyra thus wee may beleeue, Lo here the Bowe and shaft, Ordained Gods weapon of reuenge on Murders cruell crafte Lo here the Bowe and arrowe, was first chosen instrument, As guerdon dew for wicked deede by Goddes most iust iudgement. Chap. 9.A Figure of Goddes Peace and Loue the rayne bow yet was set, As couenant twixt him and the earth that hee no more would let The furious floods consume the Lande, which frutefull afterward Hee made for humaine vse to serue his chosen and sauegard. Genes. 23. Ismael in the wildernes an infant crying lay, Gods Angell heard the same, and did vnto his Mother say, Hagar see thou bee of good cheare, thy Childe vp forthwith take, And cherish it for God will sure a People great him make. So this Child grewe, and it is sayd an Archer hee became And afterward in the wildernes did dwell, called Paran. Genes?.? 27. Isaac waxing old did byd Esaw his eldest Sonne, His Bowe and quyuer for to take into the feeldes and ronne, To kill some venson, which hee did, but yet in the meane while, Iacob the younger brother could full kindly him beguyle: Whereby we see whom God doth loue, vnlikely though they seeme, Are soonest blest, when worldlings of their will are frustrate cleene. Ioseph the sonne of Iacob so found fauour with his God, Genes. 49. That He was reconed as a braunch which should increase abroad: Of him t'is said, His Bow bode fast, his armes eke strengthened were, Euen by the handes of Iacobs God as did full well appeare. Ruben, Gad, and halfe Manasse Tribes three elected, in field With manly might did shoote in Bow, and carry sword and sheeld: Leuit. 1; What time with Hagarites, Iethur, Nephis, and Noab they Fought valiantly, the Lord did them assist in all assay. 1, Paral. 5. Iosuah discomfiting fiue Kings, (though Tribes that did him ayde, Iosuah. 10. As there to handle Bowes and shafts are not expressly said) Vers 13.

And sure the Lord Iehoua himselfe doth meane thereby his power, Deu.t 32. When threatning wise the wicked ones he brings thus in terror, His Arowes on them he will send (he meaneth in angry moode:) Vers 33. And eke His Bow that he will bend, And dye his shafts in bloud: Vers. 42. These shafts of his so sharpe no stone can cause them to rebound, But through the threefold armed coate they pearce with mortal wound. Balaam in his prophecie of Israels happy state, Nume 24. Saith, that his force the Vnicorne in strength should coequate. Vers. 42. The Nations, he should eate also, and broose his enemies bones: Yea, He should shoot his Arowes through those great &amp; mighty ones. Debora she euen Baracks wyfe who iudged Israell, Iudges 5.[illeg.]. In that her song for victorie, which God gaue her, doth tell, How God deliuered Iabin King of Canaan to her hand, Whose Archers noyse was so appeast eche were throughout her Land. That where none earst could water drawe, now all deuoid of feare, Might haue inough sith those their foes so happily vanquisht were. Whereby we note, although the wicked such defences haue, Yet for because in vse of them Gods goodnes they depraue, And arrogate vnto themselues, all glorie, hope, and praise, Therefore theyr good things turne to euill sometime, if not alwayes. Hanna the wife of Elcana when shee did pray so ioyed, 1. Samuel 2. The Bow with mightie men was broke to her rebuke employed: And waykeilngs girded forth them selues with str?gth (she said) like m? As who say God makes simple soules do great things now and then. Ionathas, the Sonne of Saule king Dauids mortall foe, Was Dauids faithfull Frend, when hee this watchword gaue him to, 1. Samuel 20. Cap.That hee should three dayes hyde him by the stone Ezel by name, During the time of Saule his wrath and furious raging flame. Then Ionathas sayd hee would shoot three Arrowes at that stone, As at a marck, and after hee would make a Boy to rome, And seeke the shaftes, when if I say vnto the Boy once, (See,) The arrowes are on this side thee, bring them and come, saith hee, The matter then goeth well for thee, no hurt as liueth the Lorde: But if I say vnto the Boy, (Behold:) by this watchworde, The arrowes are beyonde thee, then, make haste and get thee away, For God hath so dismissed thee, This Ionathas could say. 1. Samuel. 31. Cap. Saule and Ionathas his Sonne, with his two Brethren mo, When the Philistyans fought with them, felt God his iudgements so By the Archers and Bowemen of th'vncircumcysed theare, Saule wounded was, but his three Sonnes outright dispatched were. Dauid then before hee was of Iuda annoynted King. Ouer Saule and Ionathas moarned, thus lamenting, The Bow saith hee of Ionathas turned neuer back in vaine, Neither Saules Sword once empty went from the blood of the slaine: See theare the minde of Goddes elect, in doyng good for ill, See pity showed for cruelty, for mallys eke goodwill. 2 Samuel. 1. Cap. Dauid enduring yet long warres euen with that house of Saule, By Goddes good will exalted was, when his foes had the falle, And prospered so that hee was King ouer all Israell: Hee conquered Ierusalem and Iebusytes so fell, Who did deny him to come theare, when yet victoriously, Hee wan the Castle of Syon, which hee called his Citty, 2. Croun. 11.When hee made Ioab generall, which Iebusites first smote, With whome were mighty Men of armes euen many a one to note: 2. Croun. 21.When one or other of twelue trybes came to him day by day, Untill he had a full great hoast, Like the hoast of God to say: Who doth consider well all this most amply may beholde, Gods fauour towardes Dauid cheef and mercies manyfold. Psalm. 89 D Luthers Wordes.So as Hee againe A man was founde euen after Goddes owne hart, Yea a King to whome both faith and promise God did sure imparte: Whose Psalmody his sacred zeale to Godwardes did declare, Whose Regiment did shewe for his a Princely prudent care, As when he first enacted that eche Childe within his Lande, 2. Sam. 1. Chap. vers 18. Should be instructed for to shoot, their Enemies to withstande. In peace time prouident for warres (he said): He was at peace, Psalm. 119. With them that hated peace: In warres, he did at no time cease, To serue his God, that he would graunt assured state and stay, As at a marke that he might ayme to walke ech godly way. Idem. ve. 15. For why, he had experience good, whome God doth so elect, Ought not to feare what euer fall, his duty to neglect: But trusteth, God hath mortall Darts, yea arrowes keene and sharp, Psa. 7. ver 14. For them that him do persecute, whiles they do mischief warp: And though the wicked bend their Bowes, &amp; make their Arrowes prest Psal. 11. ve. 2. To shoot in secret, and to hurt the sounde, and harmles brest: Yet God his fiery Thunderboultes can cast them heare and theare, Psalm. 18. vers. 13. And with his fiery lightning shafts can foyle his foes with feare: And as a marke he will them set, in a most open place, Psal. 21 vers. 12. And charge his bow-strings readily against his Enemies face. Gods Arrowes sharp and keene which are, their harts so sore shal sting, Psalm. 45. Vers. 6. That Folke shall fall and kneele to him, as to the mightiest King: In Syon brake he shaft and bowe, the sworde, the speare and shielde, And brake the Ray, to ouerthrow the Battell in the fielde: Psal. 76. Vers. 3. So that his Children shall not feare, nor yet become afflight, Psal. 91. vers. 5. For all the shafts that flye by day, nor terrour in the night. Yet for an ordenary meane King Dauid doth aduance, The Bowe and shaft, as mans defence, and for his foes noyance: Extolling eke the exercyse by that same troupe or traine, Of Shooters, which in peace or warres Gods glorie do maintaine. As when these Children come to age (saith he) and actyuenes, Oh well ys he whose quyuer with such shafts the Lord doth blesse: Psalm. 127. vers. 4. &amp; 5. Whether Prince so peopled be, or Parent Children such, And so many be blest with all, they neede not feare the gruch, Or greeuous force of Enemy, If God be on their side: Rom 8. In which respect the prayer of Dauid may be applyde, When for Gods safe deliuerance from eche such Enemy, Psalm. 147. Vers. 6. (Thine Arrowes shoot and them consume) vnto the Lorde prayth he. Then seeth he, God taking his parte, it nought his foes shall boote, For, They no hurt at all shall do, when they their shafts shall shoote: Psalm 58. vers. 7. So Dauid and his Princes all after his warres, offered, Towards the building of Gods house, and thankes to him rendred, 1. Croun. 29.And when he had raigned .xl. yeers iust ouer Israell, In his owne Citty hee slept and lay, which Zyon was to tell. 1.

Croun.The race of whose Raigne .xl. yeares then beeyng consummate, In the City of Dauid eke he slept intumulate. Asa King of Iuda did destroy all Idolles theare, Commanding his, the lyuing God truly to serue and feare: 2. Croun. 14Ere hee with the AEthiopian King and his huge hoast would feight, He prayde vnto Iehoue, and hee did heare his prayer streight: Of the trybe of Beniamyn, which bare both Bow and shield, A valiant hoaste hee had which got the victory in that fielde. 3. Cro 17. Iehosophat of Iuda King, his fathers rowme possest, Who prospered trusting in his God, and was with riches blest, He toke of Strangers tribute, and had of Beniamyns trybe 200000 warlike wights with Bowe and sheeld to byde. Ahab, King of Israell, in following the aduise, 3. Crou. 18.Of those 400 Prophets dyd but fondly enterprise, At Ramoth theare in Gilead geanst the King of Aram, To feight regarding not Michah, euen then a certen Man Drewe a Bowe and smote Ahab betweene his ioyntes and eke The Brigandyne, that so hee dyed to late for helpe to seeke. 2 Cro. 26. Vzzia chosen to be King of Iuda dyd obay The Lorde Iehoue, and on a time did giue a bold assay, To warr against the Phylistens, with bowes and arrowes fell, And God in eche his enterprise dyd prosper him full well. Iosyas King of Iuda, was a Prince of godly mynde, The temple he restored, and his prayer heard did fynde, 2. Cro. 35When be a couenaunt made with God. But when vniusty hee Genst the AEgiptian King would feight neglecting Ieremy, And that same King which did dehorte him from that wilfull feight The Archers shot and wounded him vnto the death there streight. Iehu annoynted of the Lorde, tooke bowe and arrowes keene, 2 King. 9. And strongly smote Iehoram tho, his armed armes betweene The arrowe pearst euen through his hart, God would it so to bee, The whordomes of their Iesabell, and wich-crafts plagued hee. Elysha sayd vnto Ioas, then king of Israell 4. King 13. Open a window Eastward and, shoote as I shall thee tell: The Arrow of health that it may bee, The Arow of the Lords health, Against all Syria to subuert them and their common wealth. Iob, when the Lord afflicted him, by Metaphor did mone Iob. 16. The Lorde hath set mee as a marke (saith he) for him alone, And that his Arches hemd him in, and compassed him rounde, They spared mee no whit (saith he) but sore my loynes did wounde: When eke Gods iudgements in his wrath vpon the vngodly, Hee prooues doth light to their deserts, he saith, though they do fly The Iron weapons warlike yet, with the Steele bow they shall Iob. 20. Bee shot, and on them shaftes most sharp by lots must light and fall: But nombring vp Goddes benefits on him then multiplide. Iob. 29. His bow, with honour stronger dyd in his owne hand abide. Esay, the Prophet of the Lorde, when he dyd prophecy Esay. 5. Of Ierusalems Ruine, and of her captiuity, Pronounced vnto her Goddes wrath, in these wordes verament, That all Goddes arrowes sharp should bee, and all his bowes eke bent. Fortelling how Ierusalem for sinne, beseged should bee Chap. 7. With arrowes and with bowes shall one agenst her come, saith hee. Ere that the Medes and Persians should Babylon destroy: Chap. 13. With Bowes (saith hee) they shall assaile thy Children to anoy. Of Idumeas ruyn and, of all Arabyas too: He verifiyng said, they fled from drawne sword and bent Bowe. Chap. 23. And that the residew which were euen their owne Archers strong, Of Kedars Sonnes a few or none should them be found among. The same Esay reporteth eke, when Hezekiah King Chap. 37. Of Iuda heard the blasphemy of Rabsechas rayling. Sent from Senacherib, he asked counsell of Esay. Who promisd him the victory, and that without delay. But as for the Assyrian king, he neuer enter shall This Citty, nor once shoot a shaft (saith hee) to worck her thrall. This Prophet tellls when as the Lord would chuse his people so, Chap 41. Subdewing kings he gaue them as The dust his sworde vnto. And scatered them vnto his Bowe as stuble, signifiying. No power can scape his mightie hand, him to resist applying. He prophecyeth in the person of (Christ) the faithfull to assure, That God his secret fauour, and his feruent loue should dure, Towardes them. Vnder the shadowe of his hand, he hath hyd me, Chap 49. And in his quyuer a chosen shaft he me hath hydd, saith he, Lastly, I read that Esay saith, God will his Church enlarge, Chap. 66By the Apostles, Ministers, and his Disciples charge: In Affrica, Cilicia, in Parthia, and Italy. To them (he saith) that draw the Bow, not knowing his glory, Nor haue not heard his fame as yet, ne yet his glory seene, To these same Gentiles preach he will, that they may him esteeme, Chap. 50. Ieremy, in prophecying of Babylon that whoore, Her wickednes and Idolles (saith) God will them plague full sore, And that of mightie Nations, be, a multitude will bring, Out of the North (in batle aray,) themselues enarmouring: Vers 9. Their Arrowes shall be as of one that is most strong certaine: And expert too, for none of them shall once returne in vaine: He showes, the Lorde commaunds, they shall Put themselues in aray, Vers. 14 Geanst Babell round about, all ye (that bend the Bowe) I say. Shoote at her (saith he) spare no shaftes, for she against the Lorde Hath sinned, so that he the same hath greeuously abhorde. The voyce of them that flee and scape from out of Babylon Vers 28.Shall be, To shew (Goddes vengeance great ouer her) vnto Syon. Call vp the Archers geanst Babell, all ye that bend the Bowe, Besige her round about, let none escape, nor hye nor lowe. Rewarde her after her owne workes, for she hath sinned. Thus Saith Ieremy, shall she be serued for sinnes flagitius. Yea, more he addes that: Many Kings from th'earth shall raised be Vers. 41. Against her, they shall holde the Bow and Buckler, eke saith he: Chap. 51.But drawing nearer to her end (To him that bendes the bow, Vers. 3. And him that lifts vp brygandyne, by these wordes he doth show, The Lord will say, spare not her youngmen, but slay all her hoast, Vers. 10. Make bright the Arrowes, gather the shields, as if ye spare no cost: The Lord hath raised vp the spirite in the King of the Medes: His purpose is geanst Babell, to destroy her feete and heades. Chap 51. Vers. 56.And afterward, he veryfieth: The strong men of Babell Are taken, and their bowes are broke: God graunt it hap so well: But in his Lamentacions yet, this Prophet doth auowe, Lamentat. Chap.11. vers. 12. &amp; .13 God bent his bowe, and made him as a marke for the arrowe: The arrowe of his quyuer he caused to enter into my raines. This speech doth shew the Prophets grief, for his frends grief &amp; paines, Ezechiel much alike foresheweth of Gog and Magogs fall, Ezech. Chap. 39. Which fought against Gods People sore, and that with power not smal Wherefore, the Lord of hoastes by him doth fearcely thus inuay Gogs Bow out of his left hand, he will smyte and dasshe away. And out of his right hand will cause the Shaftes to fall downe flat. A fyre on Magog will he send, so as forthwith on that, They which inhabite Cityes do, throughout all Israell Shall go forth and set fiery flame vppon his weapons fell, Vppon his shields and Bucklers, and vpon eche shafte and Bowe, Yea vpon their staues euen in their handes, to burne them on a rowe, For seauen yeares space: Thus saith the Lorde, at my table ye shall With Horses, Charyots and valiant men of Warre be filled withall, So that the Lorde himselfe doth say, by this Prophet Ezechiel, Iacob I will redeeme and shewe mercy on Israell: Oseas the Prophet well concludes then this said prophecy, Ose .1. With bow nor sworde God his will saue, but with his mere mercy. Zacharias zealus in the Lorde confirmes a truth twofolde, Zacha. 9. Threatning Gentiles destruction, which are so wilfull bolde, Vers. 10. To warre against the Lordes Iuda, he telleth them therfore The Bow of their Batle shalbe broke, and God will then restore Peace to the heathen folke on earth, which had vnquyet rest. And so where warres did worke much woo, Gods peace shal make them blest But when he speakes of Iudaes blisse, enlarged, he doth show, That God his chosen Iuda hath bent out euen as a Bowe. Vers. 11. In raising vp of Syons sonnes, O Grecia, then saith he: Beholde euen as a Gyants sworde, so strong I haue made thee. Nehemyas chosen of the Lorde Ierusalems walle to builde, Nehem. Chap 4. vers. 16. By Sanballat, Tobyas, and the Arabians then withhyld Was hindered much, yet with th'one half of Iudaes yong men there, And with th'other half, which helde, the Bow, the shield and speare, With manly courage Reard, it was the walle and prosperous stood, The Rulers saw the same with ioy maugre th'enemies mood. Esdras prophecying (against Asia and Babilon, Esdras, Chap. 9. Egipt, Syria, and of eche greuous affliction, Which vppon all the worlde shal comme by Goddes decreed iudgement Saith, Strong is his right hande by whome his Bow shall so bee bent, His arrowes which hee shoots, are sharp and shall not misse, he saies, When they begin for to bee shot into the latter dayes. Iudith a worthie Wydow was, and handmayde of the Lorde Iudith. 12.Which prayde to God in her distresse, and walked in his worde What tyme that Tyrant proude assailde Nabuchadnezer hee With Olophernes his Cheeftaine, and all their huge army To come against Gods Israell, Tuelue thousand Archers stoute, And sixescore thousand others mo of that his Rakehell Rowte, Beholde God heard this woman weike, when she for hers so praide: Thy power Oh God in multitude consisteth not, she saide, Nor thy might in stronge men remaines: But thou the hope onely, Of humble myndes deffendst wayklyngs and which forsaken bee, Those thou protectst. Her prayer so did please the lyuing Lorde As by his might this woman weyke could vse the pearsing sworde That shee cut of the Captaines head, so mightie in mischeef, His members quayld, Gods will preuaild, and hers found ioy for greef. Iudas Machabeus, he, the first which bare that name, 1. Mac. 9.One of the Worthies nyne so cald deserues immortall fame For valiantly encountering with Demetrius and his hoast, Whose Archers marching in forwarde, for all their heathnish boast. Iudas in the Lordes quarrell, yet his Brethren dyd comfort, Though there he lost his life in feelde the same for to support, Reuel. 6. Iohn the deuyne Reuailes to all those that true Christians bee, Firme consolation in distresse by Christe our Lorde saith he, Beholde a white Horse, and he which vppon the same doth sit, A bow had ready drawne in hand: A Crowne and giuen him fit, And hee should go forth conquering, and ouercome eche wheare, This Christe our King doth signify, which such a rule shall beare, Through out the worlde, that hee shall shoote the shafts of his gospell, To saue for euer his elect, conquering sinne, death and hell. THE SECOND ASSERTION and ys Prophane Hystoricall. Pass on my penne from Pristine soyle of sacred Parnasse mount, And raunge the Rurall prophane feeldes to shew of what account. The Bow and Shaft haue beene to fore in learned Writers dayes: Let Claudianus first infer thereof his frendly praise: Hee saith that Nature first of all the vse of Shooting gaue, In the Porpentyne, that beast, who seemes sharp prickes to haue, Which strongly smyte what so they hit: whereby some learned men In finding this did imitate with Bowes and shafts as then. Pliny referres to Scythes, this, the Sonne of Iupiter. Plato, Chalimachus and Galen more Noble writers ferr Affirme Apollo, paterne chief and Patrone first to bee, Of Shooting in the AEthnickes dayes: as they in one agree. So Ouid iumpes with their accord, wen lo in that his fable, Lib. 1. Metamor, Hee telles how th'earth brought Python forth a serpent admirable What tyme the Delyan God which neuer vsde before that drift, Th'art of Shooting, but at Deare and Roes which ronne so swift: A thousand shaftes dyd spend vppon that vgly monster theare, And none of them but forst the bloud to issew out of her. So that his quyuer almost voyde, he naild her to the grounde, And dyd her nobly at the last by shooting sharp confounde: Wherfore that he more famous might make this his enterprise, A great and solempne game he dyd thencforth himself deuyse Which of the Serpent slaine the name of Pythians sports did beare, Who for mastry in feats of force should oken garland weare. Moreouer, Ouid doth declare Apollo, after that Lib. eodem. With Cupid (for his Archery) the god of loue did chat: And seemed to chyde him as a childe with martiall might to mell Thy bowe and shafts more meete (saith he) are with me for to dwell, But Cupid thought this vncouth speech, and to contend with him Did nothing bash (at beast saith he) I graunt that bow of thyne Thou freely vse: And so at thee his shafts shall spend my Bowe, And looke how much inferiour is eche beast to God, so knowe And holde for truth, that euen so much thy glory lesse shall bee In shootings noble exercyse, then myne is in degree: Apollo afterwardes approued these Cupides words most trewe When he was wounded with his shafte as sequell did ensewe When hee, which God of phisicks arte and surgery was calde, Could make no medicyn for releef of himself so enthralde, In Daphnes loue: who for because a Virgin shee would bee, He proffering kisses sweete in vaine, the Goddes then prayed shee, Th'earth might rather her deuoure all quick euen as she was. Then yeelde vnto Apolloes loue: But see the altered case, Well saith this God, sith thou my loue thus scornefull doost abuse, Into my Tree thou changd shalt be, and thee Ile alwaies vse Thou shalt adorne my golden lookes, and eke my pleasant harp, Thou shalt adorne my Quyuer full of arrowes keene and sharp. The valiant Knights and Emperours thou shalt adorne also. Before the Capitoll eke stand, with triumphes stately show For Conquerours and victors such, as valiant acts haue done, Before Augustus Pallaice doore, as braue as is the sunne. This Poët eke full conningly in couert wise doth shewe, Examples vertues to embrace, and vyces to eschewe. As where he doth on fained Goddes and Goddesses there treat, Sometimes he toucheth their reuenge, for crimes and vyces great. Like, as when Ioue had companie of the Nymphe Parhâsis, Lib.2. Metamor.A Knight of Phœbus troupe, which bare, a bowe sometyme ywis, She drawyng neare a certaine wood vnbending there her bowe, Layde her quyuer vnder her head, and coucht her selfe a low, Soone Iupiter spyed her and, with her stroue for some play, (In'haste her quyuer almost forgot) as then she fled away. Whome when Dyana so discryde, as she was following deare, By Iunœs iustice was transformd into an vggly Beare. Eodem. Phebus hearing that his loue Coronis, on a time. The fairest Nymphe in Thessaly, with one Isthis had lyne. A Gentleman although he were, Phebus this brookt not well. But threw his garland from his head, his harp to th'ground eke fell. His colour changed his fury flamed, his bow and shafts he takes, To slay the Mother and the Childe, all meane and might he makes. Lib. 3. Metamor. Phebe or Diana she, the Goddesse of hunting game. To bath her selfe in Cristall streame a wearied once came, And being (with her troupe of Nymphes about her) in the deepe, Her bowe and quyuer did betake to one of them to keepe, With that comes Cadmus nephew by, a huntsman euen that way, Whome wandringly (whiles to beholde this Goddesse) he did stay, She cast an angry looke on him, as though she would haue shot, A shafte at him, had her bow beene bent, as she had it not. Yet Nathles water sprinckling she, his face, and head vppon A paire of olde Hartes hornes, his head had growyng vp anon, By which this metamorphose he, who was a Man of late, And Huntsman two, to beast is like, whome his owne hounds did hate So that of them he chased was vp hill and downe the dale, Who after those his houndes before, did hallow lowd and hale: With turne, and returne, skip and skud, they followe him as their pray, Whose folly causd his fate so yll with finall death that day. Salmasis Dianas nymph (but water fairy) went Lib. 4. Metamor. Oft times vnto a certaine poole, to hunt was her intent: Yet she with loue of Mercuries sonne surprisde, in pleasures past Her youthfull yeares: (vnknowen to Phœbe) her sisters at the last Would oft perswade her painefull life, which profit might procure, Her idle time in casting dart, or shooting to enure. But she neglecting their aduise a wanton still would be, And striue with him her louer so, vntill both he and she Were chaunged from their former shape, one monster made, and were An Hermaphrodite which both man and woman did appeare. Alpheys (a Riuer cald) described her race of auncient Loue, Which would not leaue her, till she cride vnto Diana aboue, Lib. 15. Helpe Lady deare: for I thy true and trustie squyer (saith she) Which haue thy Bow and arrowes oft times carried after thee, Am now attacht of Cupids Knight, preserue my Uirgins state: Therewith the Goddesse beeing mooued, a cloude did dissipate, And couer so her Nymphe therewith, that she in safetie was. Her Louer frustrate of his will, away from her did passe. Ceypheys Lordes within his Court a while at quiet were, But when a sodaine rumour they (I wot neare what) did heare, Lib eodem Metamor. Ceyphey affirmed himselfe to be no occasioner of the same, One Atis nimble with the dart, but which did better frame In handlyng Bowe and shaft, forthwith at Persey gan to bend, Whom Pallas shrouded with her shield, and did from harme defend. Then Persey tooke a fierbrand and dasht in Atis face, Beebattering him about therewith that slaine outright he was: Whose death Lycab of Assur Land reuengd with Atis Bowe, And with his shaftes, that Persey then quite dead he laide alowe. Of discord and dissention here loe thus they rewed the end, With mischiefe they are ouermacht which mischiefe doe pretend. And though the partie which begins, when he hath mischiefe done Hath his pertaker euill, yet God his wrath can no man shone: [illeg.] what the guyltlesse want in power, the same performe God will, And take their quarrell as his owne, the Killers for to kill. Phebus bright and Mayas sonne (saith Ouid) both tyme when Came th'one from Delphos, and th'other from the mount Cyllen. Apollo Phebus yet so close could step to Chyon, where He pleasure tooke which was forspoke by Mercury his Compere Which Chyon in Appolloes eares dispraysing Dame Dyane, Herselfe vnto hym to preferre, it so to passe then came. Phebe offended therwithall, her venging Bow streight bent And shot her through the toung as for her worthie punishment: Of Ouid I omit here more, as touching tales to write, And now to other Wryters passe of Archery which recyte. Apollo, Cheefest of Archers was by Poets doome enstalde Whome they the Bearer of the Bow and mighty Shooter calde, Whereupon Claudianus saith. Mars Clipeo melior, Phebus prestantior arcu: In English. vizt. Mars with y? Buckler better was: But Apollo him with the Bow did passe. And Valerius Flaccus: saith. Arcupotens aduerte precor nunc denique Apollo. Apollo mighty Archer how? Turne thee I pray thee to mee now. Hyppochoon, Mnestion, and Eurytion all three Were Archers, which (as Virgill saith) contendted valiantly, Euen for the garland all at ones, when pastymes funerall Virgill.By AEneas were celebrate for his Father naturall, Namley Anchyses: when AEney forsaking Affrica, And sayling so through Italy, came into Silicia. Eke Coryney of Italy (saith Virgill) shot full well, But Asyla the Troyan dyd in shooting farre excell. Acastus, hee the Hunter was, an Archer tall and good, Who went with Meleager for to kill the Bore in wood. Which spoylde the Cuntry Caledon (of whome Ouid pardy Saith) fierce Leucippus, and Acast with shafts so Noble hee. Parys an Archer strong so was, that hee did ouerthrowe Virgill. Ouid in Epistell. Achilles with one shaft onely and wounded him also. The same Paris is of himself so said to make good proof, His shaft was not more to be feard, then when she flew aloof. Ouid. lib. 12. Lycota conning Archer, was more conningly cast downe Mopsus of Crete for shootings skill of Silius hath renowne Ilerdes such an Archer was whose shaft so surely aymed, Sil. III That Birdes hye houering in the ayer, he killed more then maymed, Ne was hee onely warryer stout, but huntsman skilfull so In euery course that hee could kill the hynde, the bucke or doo. Vale Flac. Lib . Argo. Alcon an Archer was of Crete, whose child a Dragon fell Perforce had caught away from him: at which hee did leuell, His shafts with such deliuery sure, that hee the Dragon slew, His childe harmelesse and from that beast did manfully reskew. Enarus, was an Archer so endewed with strength and art, Saxo Grammaticus. Hee bent his Bowe with such a force, nought could his shoot reuert. Deucaleon, Hypereseus Sonne, by Hypso the Nymphe was An Archer which in shooting farre did others much surpasse. Vale. Flac. Lib. 1. Argo. AEthalides an Orator was, which for his eloquent tonque Men dyd beleeue of Mercury, hee was the onely sonne, Lib. 1. Arg. And that this Man in Archery had fortune ioyned with fame, Valerius Flaccus in his booke doth verify the same. Catenos, hee a Souldiour did his shaft so surely leuell. Quint Cur. Lib. 6. de gest Alexander. That birdes hye mounting in the skye hee downe starck dead could fel. Toco a certen Souldiour was an Archer of such skill, Although in Cuppes his tongue could walke more voyd of wit th? wil, Saxo. gram. That hee at banquets oft would boast an apple very small A farre of held he fech of could euen his first shaft withall. Aspares one inhabitant in Garamantia Lande, Pontanus. By fyne deliuering of his shafts, is praisde for eye and hand. Euritus, King of Ochaly, and Father of Ioles, Idem. The art of shooting taught vnto the valiant Hercules. Hercules, a Shooter such did shew himselfe to bee So strong in stroke, so sure sure in ayme, so certen with the eye, Pontanus Hee Centaur Nessus ouerthrew though from him farre hee stood: And of the hartes (as swifte as winde) hee bathde his shafts in blood, Besides these hee the Harpyas (a Rauenous byrde by kinde) Could cause to tumble out of the ayer, as fethers tost with winde. Comodus the Emperour, Sonne of Marck and Faustine, was Herodia. Lib. 1. So sure a Shooter coumpted, that when beasts aloof did passe, Or swiftly ronne he neuer mist, but one or other sure, He slew with shafte, and none escapte nor could his stroke endure: But wat his eye once destned had if so hee might yt see, The same was sure with Bow and shaft his pryzed pray to bee. Ex. Aurel. Domitian the Emperour hee in shooting so excelld, That now and then a childe which forth his fingers streched held, He made his marcke twixt fingers twaine aloof held vp and wyde: The Childe vnharmed was, and eke his shafts did surely glyde. Againe two honderth beastes hee did with arrowes kill most sharp, Tranquil.Some of their heads two shafts had like the hornes of a wilde hart. Eight Contreyes, Geta, Scithia, and with them the Ithurians, The Parsij, Parthi, Sarmati, Cretii, Arimaspyans, And almoste all the Countreyes of the worlde towardes the east Were noted much in archery to haue their skill encreast. And these by seuerall Epithets had seuerall properties, Eche one his owne pertaining to this shootings exercyse, The Poets terme the Ithuryan Bowe: the Parthyans shafts they name: Sabellicus in Oraculo.The Getian string, and Quyuers eke were attribute by fame Unto them of Sarmatia, and so semblably ensewed In all the other Contreyes their owne propertyes renewed. And though in shooting eche of these skilfull and practized were, The Parthyans yet and Persians cheef prick and praise did beare: So excellent Archers were they deemed, that as they ranne the way, They shot behinde them, that therwith their Enemies they could slaye: And turning euen from them they could so hurt them which pursewed, As if with wachfull eyes they had euen face to face them vewed. Lucanus.Whereof Lucane the Poet thus mencyoneth. Ocyor &amp; missa Parthi post terga sagitta: That is in English. More swifter then Parthyan shaft so quick: behind their backe which is let slip Herodian in Clio. Cyaxares King of the Medes, which great Grandfather was To Cyrus, kept of Scythians, (which did with Bowe surpas) A sorte of shooters for the nonce, euen to enstruct and teache His Sonne Astyages, that arte most skilfully to reache. Cyrus a Childe, in this arte was so deligent educate, Xenophon in institut. Cyri.That Xenophon who writ the same, would neuer haue nominate The vse and proffit greatly so with Princely state to gree. Had not nature experience and effect enforst to bee, As Tully saith most congruent, not onely for to showe What Cyrus did, but what a Prince by dewty ought to doo, Both in pastimes for pleasure, and in seryous matters when The same may proffet Prince, himself and also other men. Darius King of Persia, the first that name which bare, Dyd shew how fit a thing it ought to bee, and nothing rare Strabo. Lib. 15. A PRINCE to practize Archery, as for the same pretence Hee left for worthy memory on his tombe this sentence. DARIVS the King lyeth buried heare, Which in shooting &amp; ryding had neuer his peare. Theodosius the Emperour had commendations Dew, Themist. in Orat. 6. Giuen him by Themistius his Philosopher trewe, For three things which hee of a Childe did vse especially, As Shooting, Ryding well on Horse, and feats of Cheualry. Cyrus what time hee conquered in manner all the world, Herodianus in Clio. Among his Persians made this Lawe, and left it sure enrould, Their Children should from fiue yeares age vntill the yeare twenty Learne three things well, To ryde, To shoot. Tell truth and neuer lye. Leo the Noble Emperour did full Christianly ordaine Leo de Stratagem. 20. A Law, eche man in time of peace should shooting so mentaine: Till hee were xl. yeares of age, and that eche house priuate Should haue a Bowe and xl. shafts in order like and rate, Ready for eche vse of neede: The omitting of which Lawe (Saith Leo) among the youth, hath beene th'effycient ouerthrawe Of Romane glory erst so braue, with losse of a great deale Of th'Empire selfe, and hynderance of our florishing publike veale. AEthiopians of the world the furdest Southward are, Whose excellency in shooting, that same historie doth declare Herodo. in Thalia. When to their King, Cambyses King of Persia once did sende Ambassadours with many gifts: Their subtill drifte and ende Th'ethiopian King discust to prooue them very spyes, And blamed their King Cambyses for such vniust enterpryse: But princely intertaining them, a Fowe he tooke (which bent And drawne by him vnbent againe) vnto their King hee sent The same with greeting (and saith hee) deliuer it him from mee, And say when any Persian can shoot in the same that hee, Then set on AEthyopians, but in meane time let him yeelde Thankes vnto God, that hath not giuen the Persians force in feelde To conquer other mens Contreyes. The bowe when as it came Among them, none at all was found which once could stirr the same: Saue onely Smerdis Brother to Cambyses who, the string Two fingers styrd, and furder could not, for the which doing, Cambyses him so sore enuyed, as doth the story say, That his owne Brother Smerdis hee therfore outright did slay. Herodot. in Euterp. Sesostris, the most mighty king that Ruled AEgipt Lande, Ouercame a great part of the worlde, and that by Archers band The Arabyans, Iewes, and Syrians hee brought in subiection, And further into Scithia went, then elsse did any one: Hee ouercame eke Thracya till the Coastes of Germany, In token wheare of euery such obtained victory, Images hee dyd erect after his owne likenes In th'one hand Bow, in th'other shaft holding for to witnesse, What weapons in his conquest, hee did vse in those his dayes, Whereby he gained glory condigne, and eke a lasting praise. Diod. Sic. Tewcer amongst the Græcians for his shooting bare the bell Who (when Hector the Græcyans ships by fire thought to quell:) With his Bow droue them backe agen: Neither could noble Troy Haue beene destroyd by Græcyans, if with shootings dire anoy Of Hercules shaftes, it had not bene assaulted as it was, Whereby the ruyn of the same the soner came to passe. THE THIRDE ASSERTION Englishe Hystoricall. Relinquishing those prophane feates and fautors, now my penne Approche the prowesse and the praise of natiue Elglishmen: From Brute the Troyans time, who as hee vsed shooting theare When vnwares he his Father slew, in forest hunting deare Anno ante Christ. 1108After hee had by that mischaunce his Syluius deare bereft, Aryued in this our Albyon then his natiue Troy so left. The Brytons his successors ruled this Lande, till Cæsar hee Conquerd the same, not long before Christes natiuity. The Romans continewed. 483, yearesThe Romanes held the Brittaines in their rule and tribute long. Agricola a Capteyn (sent the Romanes from among) With shot of arrowes and of darts did greeue the Brittons much They with huge swords and bucklers smal eke kept the Romans tuch. Post Christum. 490. Hengist a Saxon hether came, in kent whose Kingdome was. And warrd vppon the Brytons till he lyued in quyet case ARTHVRE the mirrour of manhood, and Champion of Cheualrie. Anno post. Xp?. 518. Subdewed the Saxons to him tho, with many a victorie Among the Brittons after his time, west Saxons still bare sway, Aelfird, a Godly learned King a Saxon, stories saye 872. By cruell pursute of the Danes which troubled then this Land, Dyd wander with his Bow and shafts their force and did withstand: For God not onely victor him full many a time did make Ouer the Paganes, but by him enforst their force to stake. Harolde the Dane vsurpt and tooke on him to raigne as king, Untill the tyme of Willyam Duke of Normandies coming: Whose powers together beeing met Haroldes was ouermatcht, And hee (a shaft shot into his head) at once was so dispacht. Willyam the Duke had conquerd there this Land &amp; ruled the same, Anno xp?. nato. 1066. 1. W. 1. Archb. and Abot of Cantirbury But not in bondage would shee lyue thoug he her ouercame It's worth the reading therfore heare to shew how Stigand then Archbishop, and how Egelstyn that Abbot playde the men: For freedome of their Cnntrey, thus therfore they did deuise, A power of Horsemen and footemen should for time exercyse Alongst their feeldes as't were lanelike long boughes &amp; large to beare, To make the Duke should thether come, when hee therof did heare. And as they said it hapned so, the Duke came with his traine, Who seeing this thought it had bene euen moouing trees certaine: Whereto approching with meane space (discomfited in minde) Hee pawsd, the Kentish power a far did smell him in the winde. Who (when within their army him enclosed got they had) Down cast their boughs vp bent their Bowes their shafts to shoot most glad. The trompets sound, their Banners waue, their weap?s busied were, To feight with whome they so desyrde in Cuntryes quarrel there. So hee, who thought he had in his fist the whole land late so fast, Began his life now to despaire, affrighted and agast: Then they oracion frendly framed, condicions graunt hee should, Their wonted freedome that they might in certaine order holde: Hee thereto grees, confirmes the graunt by pledge sufficyent so, That by this meanes those liberties continwed hetherto. Willyam Rufus was his sonne, who ruled not so well, Anno 1100 13. W. 2. As that men could not weepe for ioy of his death to heare tell, To his owne subiectes wicked hee and so to strangers was: But most wicked vnto himselfe when Gods will taking place In Hamshyer that new forrest, as hee hunted on a time, A Knight in shooting at a Deare gaue him his fatall fine. But now of Noble Princes I will penne the noble praise, Euen such as worthie Archery mentained in their dayes. Anno. 1105. Henry the First of England King, fought many a battell strong Anno. 1119. &amp; 1128. 6. 20. &amp; 29. of H. 1.Agenst the French with Archers stout, his other powers among: A victor eke hee still preuaild in warres: and in peace tyme, His People vnto shooting did them selues greatly enclyne. Stephen, King of England stoutly dyd with Archers in his bande Anno. 1139.As also by his other powers the Scottish broylles withstand: 4. St. 1.He made warres eke genst Robert then the Earle of Glocester Who did inuade his Kingdome with ten knights and in nomber Of Archers iust so many, which on horseback passed through The midst of all the Realme, but yet resisted well enough. Anno 1171. 17 H 2. Henry the second valyantly aduentured Irelands soyle With warlike power, some Archers were, with labour small and toyle The Archbishops and Bishops did receiue him for their King, And hee them ruled like worthie prince in loue and peace tendring. Richard Cœur de Lyon cald a king and Conquerour was, Anno. 1191. 2. Ric 1.With Phillip king of France, who did vnto Ierusalem passe: Olde Chronicles report, his power had Archers them among, Whose force confounded Pagans fell and layde them dead along. In this Kings time was Robyn Hood: that Archer and outlawe, And litle Iohn his partener eke, vnto them which did drawe One hondred tall and good Archers, on whome foure hondred men Were their power neuer so strong could not giue onset then: The Abbots Monkes and Carles rich, these onely did molest And reskewd woemen when they saw of theeues them so opprest, Restoring poore mens goods, and eke aboundantly releeued Poore Trauellers which wanted food, or were with sicknes greeued. And, heare because of Archery I do by penne explane The vse, the proffet, and the praise, to England by the same, (1553.)My self remembreth of a childe in Contreye natiue mine: (7. E. 6)A May game was of Robyn-hood and of his traine that time To traine vp young men, stripplingsand, eche other younger childe In shooting, yearely this with solempne feast was by the Guylde, Or Brother hood of Townsmen done, with sport, with ioy, and loue To proffet which in present tyme, and afterward did proue. Iohn King, subdewed Ireland with manly force and might 1210. Of Horsemen, Archers, speares, and such as put their foes to flight. Edward the second that valyant Prince, when Scotland hee rescewed, 1513. From them, whose force his Father had not long before subdewed, 7. E. 2. Scotland. In his hoste for his second ward had Archers and footmen, But many of the Enemies were slaine by Archers then. Edward that victorious King the thirde so cald by name, When his noble Nauy agenst the French Kings nauy came, Anno 1540 The Batle on the Sea. Hee had the winde most wishfully and sonne so at his back, His purpose and his enterprise that hee no time did slack: 13. E. 3. A shower of English arrowes sharp from long bowes powered downe, Uppon the Frenchmen, whereby fell to our men great renowme, When at that Bickering Frenchmen there to leaue their ships were faine, And leape into the seayes for want of landing place certaine. Therles of Northampton, and of Oxeford fought also, 1544. 17. E. 4. Batle at Morles. With Charles Duke of Brittayne, as the Chronicles do shoe: At Morleys where oure men of armes, and Archers valyant might Subdewed that Contrey, foilde their foes, and wan that field outright. That yeare the King the noble Earle of Darby eke did send, Newly create first King of Man, with an army to thend Gascoyne. Anno. dicit. Hee Gascoyne by strong power might win, which hee w? great goodwill, And Archers ayde, (as God would giue him leaue) did so fulfill: For many a walled Towne hee theare and castle also wonne, With skermishes which made his foes to flee away and ronne, So that hee dubbed there .50. Knights as Chronicles declare, And to his King with honour dewe did homewards then repare. The noble King in person came agenst the French at length, And made the English Dragon mount in feelde with force and strength: Cressy. When Oleflam that Frenchmen bare, went flittering to and fro, Which ayded was at Cressy feelde by other Kings twaine mo, Of Boheme and of Malogres: their men innumerable, The English fifteene hondreth scarse nothing like comparable. K. Edward hee corageously endured from noone to night, The English Archers did their best with arrowes long and light. Their Footemen (being plast among their Horsemen greeued and gald, With Archers girdes) were troden downe and so sore ouerhalde, That great and greeuous was their crye, but greater was the showte, Which in pursute our Shooters gaue th'enimies hoast throughout: Their aray was broke, they scattered were, and by our armed men Were many of them beaten downe, the rest did flee as then. Anno. dict. Dyrham.And see, about that present time. The Scots with power inuade This Realme as farre as Dyrham come, with weapon and with blade: Th'archbishop of Yorke and States there left as then which were, With the Archers tall a nomber good and stout of Lankashier Encountring with the King of Scots and all his hoste, in fine, Dauid their King sore wounded was with shafts that present time. A nomber of his cheef Lordes and Knights were taken there captiues, Of common Souldiours most parte slaine, a few fled with their lyues. Anno. 1349. K. Edward yet did vnderstand Calys betrayed should bee, Hee therefore as a valyant Prince gathered an Army, 14. E 4.Of horse and man, of billes and bowes, of speares and swordes also, Embarcked in an Nauy meete, and Calys comes hee to: Callys.About their Kingly Conquerour this English Army clings, As who (next God) would cleaue to him aboue all earthly things, Hee with a Kingly courage doth likewise vnto them call, Hee placeth them in Batle ray and princely cheares them all. But specially to his Archers which, stood on the hilles there drye Doo well yee Archers play the men, and know (saith hee) that I Am EDWARD of Windsore: herewith, th?selues they did prepare, To set vppon their Enemies, no force nor might they spare. The shafts from hilles so hye sent downe into the valleys lowe, Did wash the Frenchmen euery wheare like mighty flakes of snow, But such a washing as that was with woundes and wofull plight, They seldome saw, which with the same were foyld and slaine outright. God giuing him this victory, the King doth order take, For all things meete, and his returne to England streight dothe make: Wheare hee the first Feast did ordaine of S.

Thus passed they the time with toyle, when all their shafts were spent, To lay on load with Sword and Bill, to hand strokes foot they went, The French King and his sonne they tooke, and almost all his peares, And Thirtie thousand slew besides in those their warlike feares.

To Mutterell eke in Fraunce Which sent were, and the same beseeged, by (Gods will,) not by chance All these and euery hoaste of them (I say) in this Kings time Some part of prowesse, praise, and proffet to the Bowe resine.
