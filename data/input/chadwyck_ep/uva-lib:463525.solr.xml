      <field name="fulltext">IV. LILIES OF THE TEMPLE. FROM UNPUBLISHED MSS. I. THE HOLY COMMUNION. O gratious Lord, how shall I know Whether in these gifts Thou bee so As Thou art everywhere? Or rather so, as Thou alone Tak'st all y? Lodging, leaving none For Thy poore creature there. First I am sure, whether bread stay, Or whether Bread doe fly away, Concerneth Bread, not mee; But y? both Thou and all Thy traine Bee there, to Thy truth and my gaine Concerneth mee and Thee. And if in comming to Thy foes, Thou dost come first to them, y? showes The hast of Thy good will; Or if that Thou two stations makest, In Bread and mee, the way Thou takest Is more, but for mee still. Then of this also I am sure, That Thou didst all these pains endure T'abolish Sinn, not Wheat; Creatures are good, and have their place; Sinn onely, w?? did all deface, Thou drivest from his seat. I could beleeve an Impanation At the rate of an Incarnation, If Thou hadst dyde for Bread; But that w?? made my soule to dye, My flesh and fleshy villany, That allso made Thee dead. That flesh is there mine eyes deny: And what shold flesh but flesh discryâ The noblest sence of five? If glorious bodies pass the sight, Shall they be food and strength and might, Euen there where they deceiue? Into my soule this cannot pass; Flesh, though exalted, keeps his grass, And cannot turn to soule. Bodyes and Minds are different spheres; Nor can they change their bounds and meres, But keep a constant Pole. This gift of all gifts is the best, Thy flesh the least y? I request; Thou took'st that pledg from mee: Give me not that I had before, Or give me that so I have more; My God, give mee all Thee. II. LOVE. Thou art too hard for me in Love; There is no dealing w?? Thee in that Art, That is Thy Masterpeece, I see. When I contrive and plott to prove Something that may be conquest on my part, Thou still, O Lord, outstrippest mee. Sometimes, when as I wash, I say, And shrodely as I think, âLord, wash my soule, More spotted then my Flesh can bee.â But then there comes into my way Thy ancient baptism, w?? when I was foule And knew it not, yet cleansÃ¨d mee. I took a time when Thou didst sleep, Great waves of trouble combating my brest: I thought it braue to praise Thee then; Yet then I found that Thou didst creep Into my hart w?? ioye, giving more rest Than flesh did Lend Thee back agen. Let mee but once the conquest have Vpon y? matter, 'twill Thy conquest prove: If Thou subdue mortalitie, Thou dost no more than doth y? graue; Whereas if I orecome Thee and Thy love, Hell, Death, and Divel come short of mee. III. TRINITY SUNDAY. He that is one Is none; Two reacheth Thee In some degree: Nature and Grace W?? Glory may attaine Thy Face. Steele and a flint strike fire; Witt and desire Never to Thee aspire, Except life catch and hold those fast. That w?? beleefe Did not confess in y? first Theefe His fall can tell From Heaven through Earth to Hell Lett two of those alone To them that fall, Who God and Saints and Angels loose at last: Hee that has one Has all. IV. EUEN-SONG. The Day is spent, and hath his will on mee: I and y? Sunn haue runn our races: I went y? slower, yet more paces; For I decay, not hee. Lord, make my Loss vp, and sett mee free, That I, who cannot now by day Look on his daring brightnes, may Shine then more bright then hee. If Thou deferr this light, then shadow mee, Least that the Night, earth's gloomy shade, Fouling her nest, my earth invade, As if shades knew not Thee. But Thou art Light and darkness both togeather: If that bee dark we cannot see, The sunn is darker then a Tree, And Thou more dark then either. Yet Thou art not so dark since I know this, But that my darknes may touch Thine; And hope that may teach it to shine, Since Light Thy darknes is. O lett my Soule, whose keyes I must deliver Into the hands of senceles dreames, W?? know not Thee, suck in Thy beames, And wake w?? Thee for ever. V. THE KNELL. The Bell doth tolle: Lord, help Thy servant, whose perplexÃ¨d Soule Doth wishly look On either hand, And sometimes offers, sometimes makes a stand, Strugling on th'hook. Now is the season, Now y? great combat of our flesh and reason: O help, my God; See, they break in, Disbanded humours, sorrows, troops of Sinn, Each w?? his rodd. Lord, make Thy Blood Convert and colour all the other flood And streams of grief, That they may bee Julips and cordials when we call on Thee For some relief. VI. PERSEVERANCE. My God, y? poore expressions of my Love, W?? warme these lines and serve them vp to Thee, Are so as for the present I did moue, Or rather as Thou mouÃ¨dst mee. But what shall issue, whether these my words Shal help another, but my iudgment bee; As a burst fouling-peece doth saue y? birds, But kill the man, is seald w?? Thee. For who can tell, though Thou hast dyde to winn And wedd my soule in glorious paradise, Whither my many crymes and vse of sinn May yet forbid the banes and bliss? Onely my soule hangs on Thy promises, W?? face and hands clinging vnto Thy brest; Clinging and crying, crying w??out cease, âThou art my Rock, Thou art my Rest.â VII. THE CONVERT. If ever tears did flow from eyes, If ever voice was hoarse with cries, If ever heart was sore with sighs,â Let now my eyes, my voice, my heart Strive each to play their part. My eyes, from whence these tears did spring, Where treach'rous Syrens us'd to sing, Shall flow no more, untill they bring A deluge on my sensual flame, And wash away my shame. My voice, that oft with foolish lays, With vows and rants and senseless praise, Frail Beauty's charms to heav'n did raise, Henceforth shall only pierce the skies In penitential cryes. My heart, that gave fond thoughts their foodâ Till now averse to all that's good, The Temple where an idol stood, Henceforth in sacred flames shall burn, And be that idol's urn.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">V. PSALMS. HITHERTO UNCOLLECTED AND INEDITED PSALM III. ANOTHER TRANSLATION. How are my foes increasÃ¨d, Lord! many are they that rise Against me, saying, for my soul no help in God there is. But Thou, O Lord, ar't still the shield of my deliverance; Thou art my glory, Lord, and He that doth my head advance. I cry'd unto the Lord, He heard me from His holy hill; I laid me down and slept, I wak't; for God sustain'd me still. Aided by Him, I will not fear ten thousand enemies, Nor all the people round about that can against me rise. Arise, O Lord, and rescue me; save me, my God, from thrall; 'Tis Thou upon the cheek-bone smit'st mine adversaries all; And Thou hast brok th'ungodly's teeth: salvation unto Thee Belongs, O Lord; Thy blessing shall upon Thy people be. G. H. PSALM IV. ANOTHER TRANSLATION. Lord, hear me when I call on Thee, Lord of my righteousness; O Thou that hast enlargÃ¨d me when I was in distress. Have mercy on me, Lord, and hear the prayer that I frame; How long will ye, vain men, convert my glory into shame? How long will ye seek after lies, and vanity approve? But know the Lord Himself doth chuse the righteous man to love. The Lord will hearken unto me when I His grace implore; O learn to stand in awe of Him, and sin not any more. Within your chamber try your hearts; offer to God on high The sacrifice of righteousness, and on His grace rely. Many there are that say, âO, who will show us good?â But, Lord, Thy countenance's cheering light do Thou to us afford. For that, O Lord, with perfect joy shall more replenish me Then worldlings joy'd with all their store of corn and wine can be. Therefore will I lie down in peace and take my restful sleep; For Thy protection, Lord, alone shall me in safety keep. G. H. PSALM VI. Rebuke me not in wrath, O Lord, nor in Thine anger chasten me O pity me; for I, O Lord, am nothing but infirmitie. O heal me, for my bones are vex'd, my soul is troubled very sore; But, Lord, how long so much perplex'd shall I in vain Thy grace implore? Return, O God, and rescue me, my soul for Thy great mercy save; For who in death remember Thee? or who shall praise Thee in the grave? With groaning I am wearied, all night I make my couch to swim, And water with salt tears my bed; my sight with sorrow waxeth dim. My beauty wears and doth decay, because of all mine enemies; But now from me depart away, all ye that work iniquities. For God Himself hath heard my cry; the Lord vouchsafes to weigh my tears; Yea, He my prayer from on high and humble supplication hears. And now my foes the Lord will blam that e'rst so sorely vexÃ¨d me, And put them all to utter shame, and to confusion suddainly. Glory, honour, power, and praise To the most glorious Trinity; As at the first beginning was, is now, and to eternity. G. H. GLORIA TO PSALM XXIII. To Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, one consubstantial Three, All highest praise, all humblest thanks, now and for ever be. G. H. PSALM VII. Save me, my Lord, my God, because I put my trust in Thee; From all that persecute my life, O Lord, deliver mee. Lest like a lion swollen with rage he do devour my soul; And peace-meal rent it, while there's none his mallice to controul. If I have done this thing, O Lord, if I so guilty be; If I have ill rewarded him that was at peace with me; Yea, have not oft deliver'd him that was my causeless foe; Then let mine enemie prevail unto mine overthrow. Let him pursue and take my soul, yea, let him to the clay Tread down my life, and in the dust my slaughter'd honour lay. Arise in wrath, O Lord, advance against my foes' disdain; Wake and confirm that judgment now which Thou did'st foreordain. So shall the people round about resort to give Thee praise; For their sakes, Lord, return on high, and high Thy glory raise. The Lord shall judge the people all: O God, consider me According to my righteousness and mine integritie. The wicked's malice, Lord, confound, but just me ever guide; Thou art that righteous God by whom the hearts and rains are try'd. God is my shield, Who doth preserve those that in heart are right; He judgeth both the good and those that do His justice slight. Unless the wicked turn again, the Lord will whet His sword; His bow is bent, His quiver is with shafts of vengeance stor'd. The fatal instruments of death in that preparÃ¨d lie; His arrows are ordain'd 'gainst him that persecuteth me. Behold, the wicked travelleth with his iniquitie; Exploits of mischief he conceives, but shall bring forth a lye. The wicked diggÃ¨d, and a pit for others' ruine wrought; But in the pit which he hath made Shall he himself be caught. To his own head his wickedness shall be returnÃ¨d home; And on his own accursÃ¨d pate his cruelty shall come. But I, for all His righteousness, the Lord will magnifie; And ever praise the glorious Name of Him that is on high. G. H. PSALM I. Blest is the man that never would In councels of th'ungodly share, Nor hath in way of sinners stood, Nor sitten in the scorner's chair. But in God's Law sets his delight, And makes that Law alone to be His meditation day and night: He shall be like an happy tree, Which, planted by the waters, shall With timely fruit still loden stand; His leaf shall never fade, and all Shall prosper that he takes in hand. The wicked are not so; but they Are like the chaff, which from the face Of earth is driven by winds away, And finds no sure abiding place. Therefore shall not the wicked be Able to stand the Judge's doom; Nor in the safe society Of good men shall the wicked come. For God Himself vouchsafes to know The way that right'ous men have gone; And those ways which the wicked go Shall utterly be overthrown. PSALM II. Why are the heathen swell'd with rage, The people vain exploits devise? The kings and potentates of earth Combin'd in one great faction rise? And taking councels 'gainst the Lord And 'gainst His Christ, presume to say, âLet us in sunder break their bonds, And from us cast their cords away.â But He that sits in heaven shall laugh, The Lord Himself shall them deride; Then shall He speak to them in wrath, And in sore anger vex their pride. âBut I am God, and seated King On Sion, His most holy hill; I will declare the Lord's decree, Nor can I hide His sacred will. He said to Me, Thou art My Son, This day have I begotten Thee; Make Thy request, and I will grant, The heathen shall Thy portion be Thou shalt possess earth's farthest bounds, And there an awful sceptre sway; Whose pow'r shall dash and break them all, Like vessels made of brittle clay.â Now therefore, O ye kings, be wise; Be learnÃ¨d, ye that judge the earth; Serve our great God in fear; rejoice, But tremble in your highest mirth. O kiss the Son, lest He be wroth, And straight ye perish from the way: When once His anger burns, thrice blest Are all that make the Son their stay. G. H. PSALM V. Lord, to my words encline Thine ear, My meditation weigh; My King, my God, vouchsafe to hear My cry to Thee, I pray. Thou in the morn shalt hear my mone; For in the morn will I Direct my prayers to Thy throne, And thither lift mine eye. Thou art a God, Whose puritie Cannot in sins delight; No evil, Lord, shall dwell with Thee, Nor fools stand in Thy sight. Thou hat'st those that unjustly do, Thou slay'st the men that lye; The bloody man, the false one too, Shall be abhorr'd by Thee. But in th'abundance of Thy grace Will I to Thee draw near, And toward Thy most holy place Will worship Thee in fear. Lord, lead me in Thy righteousness, Because of all my foes; And to my dym and sinful eyes Thy perfect way disclose. For wickedness their insides are, Their mouths no truth retain, Their throat an open sepulcher, Their flattering tongues do fain. Destroy them, Lord, and by their own Bad councels let them fall In hight of their transgression; O Lord, reject them all; Because against Thy Majesty They vainly have rebell'd. But let all those that trust in Thee With perfect joy be fill'd: Yea, shout for joy for evermore, Protected still by Thee; Let them that do Thy name adore In that still joyfull bee. For God doth righteous men esteem, And them for ever bless; His favour shall encompass them,â A shield in their distress.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VI. SECULAR POEMS. WITH ADDITIONS FROM MSS. I. SONNETS SENT BY GEORGE HERBERT TO HIS MOTHER AS A NEW YEAR'S GIFT FROM CAMBRIDGE. My God, where is that ancient heat towards Thee Wherewith whole shoals of martyrs once did burn, Besides their other flames? Doth poetrie Wear Venus' liverie, onely serve her turn? Why are not sonnets made of Thee, and layes Upon Thine altar burnt? Cannot Thy love Heighten a spirit to sound out Thy praise As well as any she? Cannot thy Dove Outstrip their Cupid easilie in flight? Or, since Thy wayes are deep, and still the same, Will not a verse runne smooth that bears Thy Name? Why doth that fire, which by Thy power and might Each breast does feel, no braver fuel choose Then that which one day worms may chance refuse? Sure, Lord, there is enough in Thee to drie Oceans of ink; for, as the Deluge did Cover the earth, so doth Thy Majestie. Each cloud distills Thy praise, and doth forbid Poets to turn it to another use; Roses and lilies speak Thee, and to make A pair of cheeks of them is Thy abuse. Why should I women's eyes for crystal take? Such poor invention burns in their low minde, Whose fire is wild, and doth not upward go To praise, and on Thee, Lord, some ink bestow. Open the bones, and you shall nothing finde In the best face but filth; when, Lord, in Thee The beauty lies in the discoverie. II. INSCRIPTION IN THE PARSONAGE, BEMERTON. TO MY SUCCESSOR. If thou chance for to find A new House to thy mind, And built without thy Cost; Be good to the Poor As God gives thee store, And then my Labour's not lost. II. INSCRIPTION IN THE PARSONAGE, BEMERTON. ANOTHER VERSION. Fuller writes in his character of The Faithful Minister: âA clergyman who built his house from the ground wrote on it this counsel to his successor:â If thou dost find An house built to thy mind, Without thy cost; Serve thou the more God and the poor; My labour is not lost. III. ON LORD DANVERS. Sacred marble, safely keepe His dust who under thee must sleepe Untill the graves againe restore Theire dead, and time shal be no more. Meane while, if Hee which all thinges weares Doe ruine thee, or if the tears Are shed for him dissolve thy frame, Thou art requited; for his fame, His vertues, and his worth shal bee Another monument for thee. G. Herbert. IV. ON SIR JOHN DANVERS. By the same (George Herbert), Orator of [the] University at Cambridge; pinned on the curtaine of the picture of the old Sir John Danvers, who was both a handsome and a good man: Passe not by; Search, and you may Find a treasure Worth your stay. What makes a Danvers Would you find? In a fayre bodie A fayre mind. S? John Danvers' earthly part Here is copied out by art; But his heavenly and divine In his progenie doth shine. Had he only brought them forth, Know that much had been his worth. Ther's no monument to a sonne; Read him there, and I have done. V. A PARADOX. THAT THE SICK ARE IN A BETTER CASE THEN THE WHOLE. (From Rawlinson MSS. in Bodleian, Oxford, p. 78.) You who admire yourselves because You neither grone nor weepe, And think it contrary to nature's laws To want one ounce of sleepe; Your strong beleife Acquits yourselves, and gives y? sick all greife. Your state to ours is contrary; That makes you thinke us poore: So Black-Moores think us foule, and wee Are quit w?? y?, and more: Nothing can see And judg of things but mediocrity. The sick are in y?selves a state W?? health hath nought to doe; How know you that o? tears p?'ceed from woe, And not fr? better fate? Since that Mirth hath Her waters alsoe and desyrÃ¨d bath. How know you y? y? sighs wee send Fr? want of breath p?'ceede, Not fr? excesse? and therefore we do spend That w?? we do not neede: So trembling may As well shew inward warblings as decay. Cease y? to judge calamityes By outward forme and shew, But view yourselves, and inward turn yo? eyes, Then you shall fully know That your estate Is, of y? two, y? farre more desperate. You allwayes feare to feele those smarts W?? we but sometimes p?'ve; Each little comfort much affects o? hearts, None but gross joyes you move; Why, then confesse Your feares in number more, yo? joyes are lesse. Then for yo?selves not us embrace Plaints to bad fortune due; For though you visitt us, and plaint o? case, Wee doubt much whether you Come to our bed To comfort us, or to be comforted. G. Herbert. VI. G. H. TO Y? QUEENE OF BOHEMIA. Bright soule, of whome if any countrey knowne Worthy had bin, thou hadst not lost thine owne; No Earth can bee thy Jointure, For the sunne And starres alone vnto y? pitch doe runne And pace of thy swift vertues; onely they Are thy dominion. Those that rule in clay Stick fast therein, but thy transcendent soule Doth for two clods of earth ten spheres controule, And though starres shott from heauen loose their light, Yet thy braue beames, excluded from their right, Maintaine their Lustre still, &amp; shining cleere Turne watrish Holland to a chrystalline sphere. Mee thinkes, in that Dutch optick I doe see Thy curious vertues much more visibly: There is thy best Throne, for afflictions are A foile to sett of[f] worth &amp; make it rare. Through y? black tiffany thy vertues shine Fairer and richer. Now wee know what's thine, And what is fortune's. Thou hast singled out Sorrowes &amp; griefs, to fight with them about At there owne weapons, w??out pomp or state To second thee against their cunning hate. O what a poore thing 'tis to bee a Queene When scepters, state, Attendants are y? screene Betwixt us &amp; the people! when-as glory Lyes round about us to helpe out y? story, When all things pull &amp; hale, y? they may bring A slow behauiour to the style of king; When sense is made by Comments, But y? face Whose natiue beauty needs not dresse or lace To serue it forth, &amp; being stript of all Is self-sufficient to bee the thrall Of thousand harts: y? face doth figure thee And show thy vndiuided Maiestye W?? misery cannot vntwist, but rather Addes to the vnion, as lights doe gather Splendour from darknes. So close sits y? crowne About thy temples y? y? furious frowne Of opposition cannot place thee where Thou shalt not be a Queene, &amp; conquer there. Yet hast thou more dominions: God doth giue Children for kingdomes to thee; they shall liue To conquer new ones, &amp; shall share y? frame Of th'vniuerse, like as y? windes, &amp; name The world anew: y? sunne shall neuer rise But it shall spy some of their victories. Their hands shall clipp y? Eagles winges, &amp; chase Those rauening Harpyes w?? peck at thy face At once to Hell, without a baiting while At Purgatory, their inchanted Ile And Paris garden. Then let their perfume And Spanish sents, wisely layd vp, presume To deale w?? brimstone, y? vntamÃ¨d stench Whose fier, like their malice, nought can quench. But ioyes are stord for thee; thou shalt returne Laden w?? comforts thence, where now to morne Is thy chief gouerment, to manage woe, To curbe some Rebell teares w?? faine would flow, Making a Head &amp; spring against thy Reason. This is thy empire yet: till better season Call thee from out of y? surrounded Land; That habitable sea, &amp; brinish strand, Thy teares not needing. For y? hand Divine, W?? m?gles water w?? thy Rhenish wine, Will power full ioyes to thee; but dregs to those And meet theire tast who are thy bitter foes. L'ENVOY. Shine on, Maiestick soule, abide Like Dauid's tree, planted beside The Flemmish riuers: in the end Thy fruite shall w?? their drops contend; Great God will surely dry those teares, Which now y? moist land to thee beares. Then shall thy Glory, fresh as flowers In water kept, maugre the powers Of Diuell, Jesuitt, &amp; Spaine, From Holland saile into the Maine: Thence wheeling on, it compass shall This oure great Sublunary Ball, And with that Ring thy fame shall wedd Eternity into one Bedd.</field>
