      <field name="fulltext">—fit surculus Arbor. TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE AND RIGHT REVEREND FATHER IN GOD, JOHN LORD BISHOP OF LINCOLNE AND DEANE OF WESTMINSTER To his deare Friend and Schoole-fellow Abraham Cowley, on his flourishing and hopefull Blossomes. Nature we say decayes, because our Age Is worse then were the Times of old: The Stage And Histories the former times declare: In these our latter Dayes what defects are Experience teacheth, What then? shall wee blame Nature for this? Not so; let us declame Rather against our Selves: 'tis we Decay, Not She: Shee is the same every way She was at first. Cowley, thou prov'st this truth. Could ever former Age brag of a Youth So forward at these yeeres? Could Naso write Thus young such wittie Poems? Tulli's mite Of Eloquence, at this age was not seene. Nor yet was Cato's Judgement, at Thirteene So great as thine. Suppose it were so; yet He Cic'ro's Eloquence, Tully the Wit Of Ovid wanted: Ovid too came farre In Judgement behind Cato. Therefore are None of all equall unto Thee, so pretty, So Eloquent, Judicious, and Witty. Let the world's spring time but produce and show Such Blossomes as thy Writings are, and know, Then (not till then) shall my opinion be, That it is Nature faileth, and not wee. Ben. Masters. To his Friend and Schoole-fellow Abraham Cowley, on his Poeticall Blossomes. Many, when Youths of tender Age they see Expressing Cato, in their Gravity, Judgement, and Wit, will oftentimes report, They thinke their thread of Life exceeding short. But my opinion is not so of Thee, For thou shalt live, to all Posterity. These gifts will never let thee dye, for Death Can not bereave thee of thy fame, though breath. Let snarling Criticks spend their braines to find A fault, though there be none; This is my mind; Let him that carpeth with his vipers Tongue, Thinke with himselfe what he could doe as young. But if the Springing Blossomes, thus rare bee, What ripen'd Fruit shall we bereafter see? Rob. Meade, Condiscipulus. To the Reader. I I call'd the buskin'd Muse Melpomene, And told her what sad Story I would write: Shee wept at hearing such a Tragedie, Though wont in mournefull Ditties to delight. If thou dislike these sorrowfull lines; Then know My Muse with teares, not with Conceits did flow. II And as shee my unabler quill did guide, Her briny teares did on the paper fall, If then unequall numbers bee espied, Oh Reader! doe not that my error call, But thinke her teares defac't it, and blame then My Muses griefe, and not my missing Pen. Abraham Cowley. CONSTANTIA AND PHILETUS. 1 I sing two constant Lovers various fate, The hopes, and feares which equally attend Their loves: Their rivals envie, Parents hate; I sing their sorrowfull life, and tragicke end. Assist me this sad story to rehearse You Gods, and be propitious to my verse. 2 In Florence, for her stately buildings fam'd, And lofty roofes that emulate the skie; There dwelt a lovely Mayd Constantia nam'd Renown'd, as mirrour of all Italy. Her lavish nature did at first adorne, With Pallas soule in Cytherea's forme. 3 And framing her attractive eyes so bright, Spent all her wit in studie, that they might Keepe th'earth from Chaos, and eternall night; But envious Death destroy'd their glorious light. Expect not beauty then, since shee did part; For in her Nature wasted all her Art. 4 Her hayre was brighter then the beams which are A Crowne to Phœbus, and her breath so sweet, It did transcend Arabian odours farre, Or th'smelling Flowers, wherewith the Spring doth greet Approaching Summer, teeth like falling snow For white, were placed in a double row. 5 Her wit excell'd all praise, all admiration, And speech was so attractive it might be A meanes to cause great Pallas indignation, And raise an envie from that Deity. The mayden Lillyes at her lovely sight Waxt pale with envie, and from thence grew white. 6 She was in birth and parentage as high As in her fortune great, or beauty rare, And to her vertuous mindes nobility The gifts of Fate and Nature doubled were; That in her spotlesse Soule, and lovely Face Thou might'st have seene each Deity and grace. 7 The scornefull Boy Adonis viewing her Would Venus still despise, yet her desire, Each who but saw, was a Competitor And rivall, scorcht alike with Cupid's fire. The glorious beames of her fayre Eyes did move, And light beholders on their way to Love. 8 Amongst her many Sutors a young Knight Bove others wounded with the Majesty Of her faire presence, presseth most in sight; Yet seldome his desire can satisfie With that blest object, or her rarenesse see; For Beauties guard, is watchfull Jealousie. 9 Oft-times that he might see his Dearest-faire, Vpon his stately Jennet he in th'way Rides by her house, who neigh's, as if he were Proud to be view'd by bright Constantia. But his poore Master though to see her move His joy, dares show no looke betraying love. 10 Soone as the morne peep'd from her rosie bed And all Heavens smaller lights expulsed were: She by her friends and neere acquaintance led Like other Maids oft walk't to take the ayre; Aurora blusht at such a sight unknowne, To see those cheekes were redder then her owne. 11 Th'obsequious Lover follows still her traine And where they goe, that way his journey feines. Should they turne backe, he would turne backe againe; For where his Love, his businesse there remaines. Nor is it strange hee should be loath to part From her, since shee had stolne away his heart. 12 Philetus hee was call'd sprung from a race Of Noble ancestors; But greedy Time And envious Fate had labour'd to deface The glory which in his great Stocke did shine; His state but small, so Fortune did decree, But Love being blind, hee that could never see. 13 Yet he by chance had hit his heart aright, And on Constantia's eye his Arrow whet, Had blowne the Fire, that would destroy him quite, Unlesse his flames might like in her beget: But yet he feares, because he blinded is, Though he have shot him right, her heart hee'l misse. 14 Unto Loves Altar therefore hee repayers, And offers there a pleasing Sacrifice; Intreating Cupid with inducing Prayers, To looke upon, and ease his Miseries: Where having wept, recovering breath againe, Thus to immortall Love he did complaine: 15 Oh Cupid! thou whose uncontrolled sway, Hath oft-times rul'd the Olympian Thunderer, Whom all Cœlestiall Deities obey, Whom Men and Gods both reverence and feare! Oh force Constantias heart to yeeld to Love, Of all thy Workes the Master piece 'twill prove. 16 And let me not Affection vainely spend, But kindle flames in her, like those in me; Yet if that guift my Fortune doth transcend, Grant that her charming Beauty I may see: And view those Eyes which with their ravishing light, Doe onely give contentment to my sight. 17 Those who contemne thy sacred Deity, And mocke thy power, let them thine anger know, I faultlesse am, nor can't an honour be To wound your slave alone, and spare your Foe. Here teares and sighes speake his imperfect mone, In language farre more dolorous than his owne. 18 Home he retyr'd, his Soule he brought not home, Just like a Ship whil'st every mounting wave Tost by enraged Boreas up and downe, Threatens the Mariner with a gaping grave; Such did his case, such did his state appeare, Alike distracted betweene hope and feare. 19 Thinking her love hee never shall obtaine, One morne he goes to th'Woods, and doth complaine Of his unhappy Fate, but all in vaine, And thus fond Eccho, answers him againe. So that it seemes Aurora wept to heare, For th'verdant grasse was dew'd with many a teare. THE ECCHO. 1 Oh! what hath caus'd my killing miseries? Eyes, Eccho said, What hath detain'd my ease? Ease, straight the resonable Nymph replyes, That nothing can my troubled minde appease: Peace, Eccho answers. What, is any nigh? Quoth be: at which, she quickly utters, I. 2 Is't Eccho answers? tell mee then thy will: I will, shee said. What shall I get (quoth he) By loving still? to which she answers, ill. Ill? shall I void of wisht for pleasure dye? I; shall not I who toyle in ceaselesse paine, Some pleasure know? no, she replyes againe. 3 False and inconstant Nymph, thou lyest (quoth he) Thou lyest, shee said, And I deserv'd her hate, If I should thee beleeve; beleeve, (saith shee) For why thy idle words are of no weight. Weigh it (shee replyes) I therefore will depart. To which, resounding Eccho answers; part. 20 Then from the Woods with wounded heart he goes, Filling with legions of fresh thoughts his minde. He quarrels with himselfe because his woes Spring from himselfe, yet can no medicine finde: Hee weepes to quench the fires that burn in him, But teares doe fall to th'earth, flames are within. 21 No morning banisht darkenesse, nor blacke night By her alternate course expuls'd the day, Which in Philetus by a constant rite At Cupids Altars did not weepe and pray; And yet had reaped nought for all his paine But Care and Sorrow, that was all his gaine. 22 But now at last the pitying God, o'recome By's constant votes and teares, fixt in her heart A golden shaft, and she is now become A suppliant to Love that with like Dart Hee'd wound Philetus, and doth now implore With teares, ayde from that power she scorn'd before. 23 Little she thinkes she kept Philetus heart In her schortcht breast, because her owne she gave To him. Since either suffers equall smart, And alike measure in their torments have: His Soule, his griefe, his fires, now hers are growne: Her heart, her minde, her love is his alone. 24 Whilst thoughts 'gainst thoughts rise up in mutinie, Shee took a Lute (being farre from any eares) And tun'd this Song, posing that harmony Which Poets wit attributes to the Sphears: Whose ravishing Notes, if when her Love was slaine She had sung; from Styx t'had cald him backe againe. The Song. 1 To whom shall I my Sorrowes show? Not to Love, for he is blinde: And my Philetus doth not know The inward sorrow of my minde. And all the senceless walls which are Now round about me, cannot heare. 2 For if they could, they sure would weepe, And with my griefes relent: Unlesse their willing teares they keepe, Till I from th'earth am sent. Then I beleeve they'l all deplore My fate, since I them taught before. 3 I willingly would weepe my store, If the'floud would land thy Love, My deare Philetus on the shoare Of my heart; but shouldst thou prove Afeard of flames, know the fires are But bonefires for thy comming there. 25 Then teares in envie of her speech did flow From her faire eyes, as if it seem'd that there Her burning flame had melted hills of snow, And so dissol'vd them into many a teare; Which Nilus like, did quickly over-flow, And caused soone new serpent griefes to grow. 26 Heere stay my Muse, for if I should recite, Her mournefull Language, I should make you weepe Like her a floud, and so not see to write, Such lines as I and th'age requires to keepe Mee from sterne death, or with victorious rime, Revenge their Masters death, and conquer time. 27 By this time, chance and his owne industry Had helpt Philetus forward, that he grew Acquainted with her Brother, so that he, Might by this meanes, his bright Constantia view: And as time serv'd shew her his miserie: And this was the first Act in's Tragedie. 28 Thus to himselfe sooth'd by his flattering state, He said; How shall I thanke thee for this gaine, O Cupid, or reward my helping Fate, Which sweetens all my sorrowes, all my paine; What Husband-man would any sweet refuse, To reape at last such fruit, his labours use? 29 But waighing straight his doubtfull state aright, Seeing his griefes linkt like an endlesse chaine To following woes, he could despaire delight, Quench his hot flames, and empty love disdaine. But Cupid when his heart was set on fire, Had burnt his wings, and could not then retyre. 30 The wounded youth, and kinde Philocrates (So was her Brother call'd) grew soone so deare, So true, and constant, in their Amities, And in that league so strictly joyned were; That Death it selfe could not their friendship sever. But as they liv'd in love, they dyde together. 31 If one be melancholy, th'other's sad; If one be sicke, the other he is ill, And if Philetus any sorrow had, Philocrates was partner in it still: Pylades soule and mad Orestes was In these, if wee beleeve Pythagoras. 32 Oft in the Woods Philetus walkes, and there Exclaimes against his fate, fate too unkind. With speaking teares his griefes he doth declare, And with sad sighes teacheth the angrie Wind, To sigh, and though it nere so cruell were, It roar'd to heare Philetus tell his care. 33 The Christall Brookes which gently runne betweene The shadowing Trees, and as they through them passe Water the Earth, and keepe the Medowes greene, Giving a colour to the verdant Grasse: Hearing Philetus tell his wofull state, In shew of griefe runne murmuring at his Fate. 34 Philomel answeres him againe and shewes In her best language, her sad Historie, And in a mournfull sweetnesse tels her woes, Denying to be pos'd in miserie: Constantia he, she Tereus, Tereus cryes, With him both griefe, and griefes expression vies. 35 Philocrates must needes his sadnesse know, Willing in ills, aswell as joyes to share, Nor will on them the name of friends bestow, Who in sport, not in sorrowes partners are. Who leaves to guide the Ship when stormes arise, Is guilty both of sinne, and cowardise. 36 But when his noble Friend perceiv'd that he Yeelded to tyrant Passion more and more, Desirous to partake his malady, He watches him in hope to cure his sore By counsell, and recall the poysonous Dart, When it alas was fixed in his heart. 37 When in the Woods, places best fit for care, Hee to himselfe did his past griefes recite, The 'obsequious friend straight followes him, and there Doth hide himselfe from sad Philetus sight. Who thus exclaimes; for a swolne heart would breake, If it for vent of sorrow might not speake. 38 Oh! I am lost, not in this Desart Wood, But in loves pathlesse Labyrinth, there I My health, each joy and pleasure counted good Have lost, and which is more, my liberty, And now am forc't to let him sacrifice My heart, for rash beleeving of my eyes. 39 Long have I stayed, but yet have no reliefe, Long have I lov'd, yet have no favour showne, Because she knowes not of my killing griefe, And I have feard, to make my sorrowes knowne. For why alas, if shee should once but dart At me disdaine, 'twould kill my subject heart. 40 But how should shee, ere I impart my Love, Reward my ardent flame with like desire? But when I speake, if shee should angry prove, Laugh at my flowing teares, and scorne my fire? Why, he who hath all sorrowes borne before, Needeth not feare to be opprest with more. 41 Philocrates no longer can forbeare, But running to his lov'd Friend; Oh (said he) My deare Philetus be thy selfe, and sweare To rule that Passion which now masters Thee, And all thy faculties; but if't may not be, Give to thy Love but eyes that it may see. 42 Amazement strikes him dumbe, what shall he doe? Should he reveale his Love, he feares twould prove, A hindrance; which should he deny to show, It might perhaps his deare friends anger move: These doubts like Scylla and Charibdis stand, Whilst Cupid a blind Pilot doth command. 43 At last resolv'd; how shall I seeke, said hee, To excuse my selfe, dearest Philocrates; That I from thee have hid this secrecie? Yet censure not, give me first leave to ease My case with words, my griefe you should have known Ere this, if that my heart had beene my owne. 44 I am all Love, my heart was burnt with fire From two bright Sunnes which doe all light disclose; First kindling in my breast the flame desire, But like the rare Arabian Bird, there rose From my hearts ashes never quenched Love, Which now this torment in my soule doth move. 45 Oh! let not then my Passion cause your hate, Nor let my choise offend you, or detayne Your ancient Friendship; 'tis alas too late To call my firme affection backe againe: No Physicke can recure my weakn'd state, The wound is growne too great, too desperate. 46 But Counsell sayd his Friend, a remedy Which never fayles the Patient, may at least If not quite heale your mindes infirmity, Asswage your torment, and procure some rest. But there is no Physitian can apply A medicine, ere he know the Malady. 47 Then heare me, said Philetus; but why? Stay, I will not toyle thee with my history, For to remember Sorrowes past away, Is to renew an old Calamity. Hee who acquainteth others with his mone, Addes to his friends griefe, but not cures his owne. 48 But said Philocrates, 'tis best in woe, To have a faithfull partner of their care; That burthen may be undergone by two, Which is perhaps too great for one to beare. I should mistrust your love to hide from me Your thoughts, and taxe you of Inconstancy. 49 What shall he doe? or with what language frame Excuse? He must resolve not to deny, But open his close thoughts, and inward flame, With that, as prologue to his Tragedy. Hee sigh'd, as if they'd coole his torments ire, When they alas, did blow the raging fire. 50 When yeeres first styl'd me Twenty, I began To sport with catching snares that love had set, Like birds that flutter 'bout the gyn, till tane, Or the poore Fly caught in Arachnes net: Even so I sported with her Beauties light, Till I at last grew blind with too much sight. 51 First it came stealing on me, whil'st I thought, 'Twas easie to expulse it, but as fire, Though but a sparke, soone into flames is brought, So mine grew great, and quickly mounted higher; Which so have scorcht my love-strucke soule, that I Still live in torment, though each minute dye. 52 Who is it, said Philocrates, can move With charming eyes such deep affection? I may perhaps assist you in your love, Two can effect more than your selfe alone. My counsell this thy error may reclaime, Or my salt teares quench thy annoying flame. 53 Nay said Philetus, oft my eyes doe flow Like Nilus, when it scornes th'opposed shore: Yet all the watery plenty I bestow, Is to my flame an oyle, which feedes it more. So fame reports of the Dodonean spring, That lights a torch the which is put therein. 54 But being you desire to know her, she Is call'd (with that his eyes let fall a shower As if they faine would drowne the memory Of his life keepers name,) Constantia; more Griefe would not let him utter; Teares the best Expressers of true sorrow, spoke the rest. 55 To which his noble friend did thus reply: And was this all? What ere your griefe would ease Though a farre greater taske, beleev't for thee It should be soone done by Philocrates; Thinke all you wish perform'd, but see, the day Tyr'd with its heate is hasting now away. 56 Home from the silent Woods, night bids them goe, But sad Philetus can no comfort finde, What in the day he feares of future woe, At night in dreames, like truth, affrights his mind. Why do'st thou vex him, Love? Hadst eyes (I say) Thou wouldst thy selfe have lov'd Constantia. 57 Philocrates pittying his dolefull mone, And wounded with the Sorrowes of his friend, Brings him to fayre Constantia; where alone Hee might impart his love, and eyther end His fruitlesse hopes, cropt by her coy disdaine, Or by her liking, his wish't Joyes attaine. 58 Fairest (quoth he) whom the bright Heavens doe cover, Doe not these teares, these speaking teares, despise, And dolorous sighes, of a submissive Lover, Thus strucke to th'earth by your all dazeling Eyes. And doe not you contemne that ardent flame, Which from your selfe, Your owne faire Beauty came. 59 Trust me, I long have hid my love, but now Am forc't to show't, such is my inward smart, And you alone (sweet faire) the meanes do know To heale the wound of my consuming heart. Then since it onely in your power doth lie To kill, or save, Oh helpe! or else I dye. 60 His gently cruell Love, did thus reply; I for your paine am grieved, and would doe Without impeachme[n]t to my Chastity And honour, any thing might pleasure you. But if beyond those limits you demand, I must not answer, (Sir) nor understand. 61 Beleeve me vertuous maiden, my desire Is chast and pious, as thy Virgin thought, No flash of lust, 'tis no dishonest fire Which goes as soone as it was quickly brought: But as thy beauty pure, which let not bee Eclipsed by disdaine, and cruelty. 62 Oh! how shall I reply (quoth shee) thou'ast won My soule, and therefore take thy victory: Thy eyes and speaches have my heart o'recome, And if I should deny thee love, then I Should bee a Tyrant to my selfe; that fire Which is kept close, burnes with the greatest ire. 63 Yet doe not count my yeelding, lightnesse in mee, Impute it rather to my ardent love, Thy pleasing carriage long agoe did win me, And pleading beauty did my liking move. Thy eyes which draw like loadstones with their might The hardest hearts, won mine to leave me quite. 64 Oh! I am rapt above the reach, said hee, Of thought, my soule already feeles the blisse Of heaven, when (sweet) my thoughts once tax but thee With any crime, may I lose all happinesse Is wisht for: both your favour here, and dead, May the just Gods [pour] vengeance on my head. 65 Whilst he was speaking this (behold their fate) Constantia's father entred in the roome, When glad Philetus ignorant of his state, Kisses her cheekes, more red then setting Sun, Or else, the morne, blushing through clouds of water, To see ascending Sol congratulate her. 66 Just as the guilty prisoner fearefull stands Reading his fatall Theta in the browes Of him, who both his life and death commands, Ere from his mouth he the sad sentence knowes, Such was his state to see her father come, Nor wisht for, nor expected to the roome. 67 The inrag'd old man bids him no more to dare Such bold intrudence in that house, nor be At any time with his lov'd daughter there Till he had given him such authority, But to depart, since she her love did shew him Was living death, with lingring torments to him. 68 This being knowne to kind Philocrates, He cheares his friend, bidding him banish feare, And by some letter his griev'd minde appease, And shew her that which to her friendly eare, Tyme gave no leave to tell, and thus his quill Declares to her, the absent lovers will. THE LETTER. PHILETUS TO CONSTANTIA. I trust (deare Soule) my absence cannot move You to forget, or doubt my ardent love; For were there any meanes to see you, I Would runne through Death, and all the miserie Fate could inflict, that so the world might say, In Life and Death I lov'd Constantia. Then let not (dearest Sweet) our absence sever Our loves, let them join'd closely still together Give warmth to one another, till there rise From all our labours, and our industries The long expected fruits; have patience (Sweet) There's no man whom the Summer pleasures greet Before he tast the Winter, none can say, Ere night was gone, he saw the rising Day. So when we once have wasted Sorrowes night, The sunne of Comfort then shall give us light. Philetus. 69 This when Constantia read, shee thought her state Most happy by Philetus Constancie, And perfect Love: she thankes her flattering Fate, Kisses the paper, till with kissing she The welcome Characters doth dull and stayne, Then thus with inke and teares writes backe againe. CONSTANTIA TO PHILETUS. Your absence (Sir) though it be long, yet I Neither forget, nor doubt your Constancie. Nor need you feare, that I should yeeld unto Another, what to your true Love is due. My heart is yours, it is not in my claime, Nor have I power to giv't away againe. There's nought but death can part our soules, no time Or angry Friends, shall make my Love decline: But for the harvest of our hopes I'le stay, U[n]lesse Death cut it, ere't be ripe, away. Constantia. 70 Oh! how this Letter did exalt his pride! More proud was he of this, then Phaeton; When Phœbus flaming Chariot he did guide, Before he knew the danger was to come. Or else then Jason, when from Colchos hee Returned, with the Fleeces victory. 71 But ere the Autumne which faire Ceres crown'd, Had paid the sweating Plow-mans greediest prayer; And by the Fall disrob'd the gawdy ground Of all her Summer ornaments, they were By kind Philocrates together brought, Where they this means t'enjoy their freedome wrought. 72 Sweet Mistresse, said Philetus, since the time Propitious to our votes, now gives us leave To enjoy our loves, let us not deare resigne His long'd for favour, nor our selves bereave Of what we wisht for, opportunitie; That may too soon the wings of Love out-flie. 73 For when your Father, as his custome is, For pleasure, doth pursue the timerous Hare; If you'l resort but thither, I'le not misse To be in those Woods ready for you, where We may depart in safety, and no more With Dreames of pleasure onely, heale our sore. 74 This both the Lovers soon agreed upon, But ere they parted, he desires that she Would blesse his greedy hearing, with a Song From her harmonious voyce, she doth agree To his request, and doth this Ditty sing, Whose ravishing Notes new fires to's old doe bring. The Song. 1 Time flye with greater speed away, Adde feathers to thy wings, Till thy hast in flying brings That wisht for, and expected Day. 2 Comforts sunne, we then shall see, Though at first it darkned bee, With dangers, yet those Clouds being gone, Our Day will put his lustre on. 3 Then though Deaths sad night doe come, And we in silence sleepe, 'Lasting Day agen will greet Our ravisht Soules, and then there's none 4 Can part us more, no Death, nor Friends, Being dead, their power o're us ends. Thus there's nothing can dissever, Hearts which Love hath joyn'd together. 75 Feare of being seen, Philetus homeward drove, But ere they part she willingly doth give As faithfull pledges of her constant love Many a kisse, and then each other leave In griefe, though rapt with joy that they have found A way to heale the torment of their wound. 76 But ere the Sun through many dayes had run, Constantia's charming beauty had o'recome Guiscardo's heart, and's scorn'd affection won, Her eyes, they conquered all they shone upon, Shot through his eyes such hot desire, As nothing but her love could quench the fire. 77 In roofes which Gold and Parian stone adorn, Proud as their Landlords minde, he did abound, In fields so fertile for their yeerly corne, As might contend with scorcht Calabria's ground; But in his soule where should be the best store Of surest riches, he was base and poore. 78 Him was Constantia urg'd continually By her friends to love, sometimes they did intreat With gentle speeches, and mild courtesie, Which when they see despis'd by her, they threat, But love too deep was seated in her heart, To be worn out with thought of any smart. 79 Her father shortly went unto the Wood To hunt, his friend Guiscardo being there, With others who by friendship and by blood Unto Constantia's aged Father were Allyed neere, there likewise were with these, His beautious Daughter, and Philocrates. 80 Being entred in the pathlesse woods, whilst they Pursue their game, Philetus which was late Hid in a thicket, carries straight away His Love, and hastens his owne hastie fate. Which came too soone upon him, and his Sunne Eclipsed was, before it fully shone. 81 For when Constantia's missed, in a maze, Each takes a severall course, and by curst fate Guiscardo runs, with a love-carried pace Towards them, who little knew their sorrowfull state: So hee like bold Icarus soaring hye To Honours, fell to th'depth of misery. 82 For when Guiscardo sees his Rivall there, Swelling with envious rage, hee comes behind Philetus, who such fortune did not feare, And with his flaming sword a way doth find To his heart, who ere that death possest him quite, In these few words gaspt out his flying sprite. 83 O see Constantia, my short race is runne, See how my blood the thirsty ground doth dye, But live thou happier then thy love hath done, And when I'm dead, thinke sometime upon me. More my short time permits me not to tell, For now death ceizeth me, ob my deare farewell. 84 As soon as he had spoke these words, life fled From's wounded body, whil'st Constantia shee Kisses his cheekes which lose their lively red, And become pale, and wan, and now each eye Which was so bright, is like, when life was done A fallen starre, or an eclipsed Sunne. 85 Thither Philocrates by's fate being drove To accompany Philetus Tragedy, Seeing his friend was dead, and's sorrowfull love Sate weeping o're his bleeding body, I Will now revenge thy death (best friend) said he, Or in thy murther beare thee company. 86 I am by Jove sent to revenge this fate, Nay, stay Guiscardo, thinke not heaven in jest, 'Tis vaine to hope flight can secure thy state. Then thrusting's sword into the Villaines brest: Here, said Philocrates, thy life I send A sacrifice, t'appease my slaughter'd friend. 87 But he falls: here take a reward said he For this thy victory, with that he flung His killing Rapier at his enemy, Which hit his head, and in his brain-pan hung. With that he falls, but lifting up his eyes, Farewell Constantia, that word said, he dyes. 88 What shall she doe? she to her brother runnes And's cold, and livelesse body doth imbrace, She calls to him, he cannot heare her moanes: And with her kisses warmes his clammy face. My deare Philocrates, shee weeping cryes, Speake to thy Sister: but no voyce replyes. 89 Then running to her Love, with many a teare, Thus her minds fervent passion she express't, O stay (blest Soule) stay but a little here, And we will both hast to a lasting rest. Then to Elisiums Mansions both together Wee'l journey, and be marryed there for ever. 90 But when she saw they both were dead, quoth she, Oh my Philetus, for thy sake will I Make up a full and perfect Tragedy, Since 'twas for me (Deare Love) that thou didst dye; Ile follow thee, and not thy losse deplore, These eyes that saw thee kill'd, shall see no more. 91 It shall not sure be said that thou didst dye, And thy Constantia live since thou wast slaine: No, no, deare Soule, I will not stay from thee, But constant be in act, as well as Name. Then piercing her sad brest, I come, she cryes, And Death for ever clos'd her weeping eyes. 92 Her Soule being fled to its eternall rest, Her Father comes, who seeing this, he falls To th'earth, with griefe too great to be exprest: Whose dolefull words my tyred Muse me calls T' o'repasse, which I most gladly doe, for feare That I should toyle too much, the Readers eare. FINIS. To the Right Worshipfull, my very loving Master, Master Lambert Osbolston, chiefe Schoolmaster of Westminster-Schoole. Sir, My childish Muse is in her Spring, and yet Can onely shew some budding of her Wit. One frowne upon her Worke (learn'd Sir) from you, Like some unkinder storme shot from your brow, Would turn her Spring to withering Autumn's time, And make her Blossomes perish, ere their Prime. But if you smile, if in your gracious Eye Shee an auspicious Alpha can descrie: How soone will they grow Fruit? How will they flourish, That had such beames their infancie to nourish? Which being sprung to ripenesse, expect then The best, and first fruits of her gratefull Pen. Your most dutifull Scholler, Abra. Cowley. THE TRAGICALL HISTORY OF Pyramus and Thisbe. 1 Where Babylons high Walls erected were By mighty Ninus wife; two houses joyn'd. One Thisbe liv'd in, Pyramus the faire In th'other: Earth nere boasted such a paire. The very sencelesse walls themselves combin'd, And grew in one; just like their Masters mind. 2 Thisbe all other women did excell, The Queene of Love, lesse lovely was than she: And Pyramus more sweet than tongue can tell, Nature grew proud in framing them so well. But Venus envying they so faire should be, Bids her sonne Cupid shew his crueltie. 3 The all-subduing God his Bow doth bend, And doth prepare his most remorselesse Dart, Which he unseene unto their hearts did send, And so was Love the cause of Beauties end. But could he see, he had not wrought their smart: For pittie sure would have o'recome his heart. 4 Like as a Bird which in a Net is tane, By strugling more entangles in the ginne; So they who in Loves Labyrinth remaine, With striving never can a freedome gaine. The way to enter's broad; but being in, No art, no labour, can an exit win. 5 These Lovers, though their Parents did reprove Their fires, and watch'd their deeds with jealousie, Though in these stormes no comfort could remove The various doubts, and feares that coole hot love: Though he nor hers, nor she his face could see, Yet this did not abolish Loves Decree. 6 For age had crack'd the wall which did them part, This the unanimate couple soone did spie, And here their inward sorrowes did impart, Unlading the sad burthen of their heart. Though Love be blinde, this shewes he can descry A way to lessen his owne misery. 7 Oft to the friendly Crannie they resort, And feede themselves with the cœlestiall ayre Of odoriferous breath; no other sport They could enjoy, yet thinke the time but short: And wish that it againe renewed were, To sucke each others breath for ever there. 8 Sometimes they did exclaime against their fate, And sometimes they accus'd imperiall Jove; Sometimes repent their flames: but all too late; The Arrow could not be recall'd: their state Ordained was by Jupiter above, And Cupid had appointed they should love. 9 They curst the wall which did their kisses part, And to the stones their dolorous words they sent, As if they saw the sorrow of their heart, And by their teares could understand their smart: But it was hard, and knew not what they meant, Nor with their sighs (alas) would it relent. 10 This in effect they said; Curs'd wall, O why Wilt thou our bodies sever, whose true love Breakes thorow all thy flintie crueltie: For both our soules so closely joyned lye, That nought but angry Death can them remove, And though he part them, yet they'l meet above. 11 Abortive teares from their faire eyes straight flow'd, And damm'd the lovely splendour of their [si]ght, Which seem'd like Titan, whilst some watry Cloud O'respreads his face, and his bright beames doth shrowd. Till Vesper chas'd away the conquered light, And forceth them (though loth) to bid Good-night. 12 But ere Aurora, Usher to the Day, Began with welcome lustre to appeare, The Lovers rise, and at that crannie they Thus to each other, their thoughts open lay, With many a Sigh, many a speaking Teare, Whose griefe the pitying Morning blusht to heare. 13 Deare Love (quoth Pyramus) how long shall wee Like fairest Flowers, not gathered in their prime, Waste precious youth, and let advantage flee, Till wee bewaile (at last) our crueltie Upon our selves, for Beautie though it shine Like day, will quickly finde an Evening time. 14 Therefore (sweet Thisbe) let us meet this night At Ninus Tombe, without the Citie wall, Under the Mulberry-Tree, with Berries white Abounding, there t'enjoy our wisht delight. For mounting Love stopt in his course, doth fall, And long'd for, yet untasted Joy, kills all. 15 What though our cruell parents angry bee? What though our friends (alas) are too unkinde? Time now propitious, may anon deny, And soone hold backe, fit opportunity. Who lets slip Fortune, her shall never finde. Occasion once pass'd by, is balde behinde. 16 Shee soone agreed to that which hee requir'd, For little Wooing needs, where both consent; What hee so long had pleaded, shee desir'd: Which Venus seeing, with blinde Chance conspir'd, And many a charming accent to her sent, That shee (at last) would frustrate their intent. 17 Thus Beautie is by Beauties meanes undone, Striving to close these eyes that make her bright; Just like the Moone, which seekes t'eclipse the Sun, Whence all her splendour, all her beames doe come: So shee, who fetcheth lustre from their sight, Doth purpose to destroy their glorious light. 18 Unto the Mulberry-tree, sweet Thisbe came; Where having rested long, at last shee gan Against her Pyramus for to exclaime, Whil'st various thoughts turmoile her troubled braine: And imitating thus the Silver Swan, A little while before her Death shee sang. The Song. 1 Come Love, why stayest thou? The night Will vanish ere wee taste delight: The Moone obscures her selfe from sight, Thou absent, whose eyes give her light. 2 Come quickly, Deare, be briefe as Time, Or wee by Morne shall be o'retane, Loves Joy's thine owne as well as mine, Spend not therefore the time in vaine. 19 Here doubtfull thoughts broke off her pleasant Song, Against her love for staying shee gan crie; Her Pyramus shee thought did tarry long, And that his absence did her too much wrong. Then betwixt longing hope, and jealousie, Shee feares, yet's loth, to tax his loyaltie. 20 Sometimes shee thinkes, that hee hath her forsaken; Sometimes, that danger hath befallen to him; Shee feares that hee another love hath taken: Which being but imagin'd, soone doth waken Numberlesse thoughts, which on her heart doe fling Feares, that her future fate too truely sing. 21 Whil'st shee thus musing sate, ranne from the Wood An angry Lyon, to the cristall Springs Neere to that place; who comming from his food, His chaps were all besmear'd with crimson bloud: Swifter then thought, sweet Thisbe straight begins To flye from him, feare gave her Swallowes wings. 22 As shee avoids the Lion, her desire Bids her to stay, lest Pyramus should come, And be devour'd by the sterne Lions ire, So shee for ever burne in unquencht fire: But feare expells all reasons, shee doth runne Into a darksome Cave, ne'r seene by Sunne. 23 With haste shee let her looser Mantle fall: Which when th'enraged Lion did espie, With bloudy teeth, he tore't in pieces small, Whil'st Thisbe ran and lookt not backe at all. For could the sencelesse beast her face descrie, It had not done her such an injurie. 24 The night halfe wasted, Pyramus did come; Who seeing printed in the subtill sand The Lions paw, and by the fountaine some Of Thisbes garment, sorrow strucke him dumbe: Just like a Marble Statue did he stand, Cut by some skilfull Gravers cunning hand. 25 Recovering breath, 'gainst Fate he gan t'exclaime, Washing with teares the torne and bloudy weed: I may, said he, my selfe for her death blame; Therefore my bloud shall wash away that shame: Since shee is dead, whose Beautie doth exceed All that fraile man can either heare or reade. 26 This speaking, hee his sharpe Sword drew, and said; Receive thou my red bloud, as a due debt Unto thy constant Love, to which 'tis paid: I straight will meete thee in the pleasant shade Of coole Elysium; where wee being met, Shall taste the Joyes, that here wee could not yet. 27 Then thorow his brest thrusting his Sword, Life hies From him, and hee makes haste to seeke his faire. And as upon the crimsond ground hee lies, His bloud spirt'd up upon the Mulberries: With which th'unspotted berries stained were, And ever since with Red they coloured are. 28 At last, came Thisbe from the Den, for feare Of disappointing Pyramus, being shee Was bound by promise, for to meete him there: But when shee saw the Berries changed were From white to blacke, shee knew not certainely It was the place where they agreed to be. 29 With what delight from the darke Cave shee came, Thinking to tell how shee escap'd the Beast; But when shee saw her Pyramus lie slaine, In what perplexitie shee did remaine! Shee teares her Golden haire, and beates her brest, All signes of raging sorrow shee exprest. 30 Shee cries 'gainst mighty Jove, and then doth take His bleeding body from the moistned ground. Shee kisses his pale face, till shee doth make It red with kissing, and then seekes to wake His parting soule with mournfull words, and's wound Washeth with teares, which her sweet speech confound. 31 But afterwards recovering breath, quoth shee, (Alas) what chance hath parted thee and I? O tell what evill hath befallen to thee, That of thy Death I may a Partner bee: Tell Thisbe, what hath caus'd this Tragedie. He hearing Thisbe's name, lift up his eye, 32 And on his Love he rais'd his dying head: Where striving long for breath, at last, said hee; O Thisbe, I am hasting to the dead, And cannot heale that Wound my feare hath bred: Farewell, sweet Thisbe, wee must parted bee, For angry Death will force me goe from Thee. 33 Life did from him, hee from his Mistris part, Leaving his Love to languish here in woe. What shall shee doe? How shall shee ease her heart? Or with what language speake her inward smart? Usuring passion reason doth o'reflow, Shee sweares that with her Pyramus shee'l goe. 34 Then takes the Sword wherewith her Love was slaine, With Pyramus his crimson blood warme still; And said, Oh stay (blest Soule) that so wee twaine May goe together, where wee shall remaine In endlesse Joyes, and never feare the ill Of grudging Friends: Then she her selfe did kill. 35 To tell what griefe their Parents did sustaine, Were more than my rude Quill can overcome. Many a teare they spent, but all in vaine, For weeping calls not backe the Dead againe. They both were layed in one Grave, life done, And these few words were writ upon the Tombe. Epitaph. 1 Underneath this Marble Stone, Lye two Beauties joyn'd in one. 2 Two whose loves Death could not sever, For both liv'd, both dy'd together. 3 Two whose Soules, being too divine For earth, in their owne Spheare now shine. 4 Who have left their Loves to Fame, And their earth to earth againe. FINIS. An Elegie on the Death of the Right Honourable, Dudley Lord Carleton, Viscount Dorchester, late Principall Secretary of State. The infernall Sisters, did a Counsell call Of all the fiends, to the black Stygian Hall; The dire Tartarean Monsters, hating light, Begot by dismall Erebus, and Night. Wheresoe're dispers'd abroad, hearing the Fame Of their accursed meeting, thither came Revenge, whose greedy mind no Blood can fill, And Envie, never satisfied with ill. Thither blind Boldnesse, and impatient Rage, Resorted, with Death's neighbour envious Age, And Messengers diseases, wheresoe're Then wandring, at the Senate present were: Whom to oppresse the Earth, the Furies sent To spare the Guilty, vex the innocent. The Councell thus dissolv'd, an angry fever, Whose quenchlesse thirst, by blood was sated never: Envying the Riches, Honour, Greatnesse, Love, And Vertue (Loadstone, which all these did move) Of Noble Carleton, him she tooke away, And like a greedy Vulture seis'd her prey: Weep with me each who either reades or heares, And know his losse, deserves his Countries teares: The Muses lost a Patron by his Fate, Vertue a Husband, and a Prop the State, Sol's Chorus weepes, and to adorne his Herse Calliope would sing a Tragicke Verse. And had there been before no Spring of theirs, They would have made a Helicon with teares. Abra. Cowley.

Hee who durst fearelesse passe blacke Acheron And dangers of the infernall Region, Leading Hells triple Porter captivate, Was overcome himselfe, by conquering Fate. The Roman Tullie's pleasing Eloquence, Which in the Eares did locke up every Sence Of the rapt hearer, his mellifluous breath Could not at all charme unremorselesse Death, Nor Solon so by Greece admir'd, could save Himselfe with all his Wisdome, from the Grave. Sterne Fate brought Maro to his Funerall flame, And would have ended in that fire his Fame; Burning those lofty Lines, which now shall be Times conquerers, and out-last Eternity. Even so lov'd Clerk from death no scape could find, Though arm'd with great Alcides valiant mind. He was adorn'd in yeeres though farre more young, With learned Cicero's, or a sweeter Tongue. And could dead Virgil heare his lofty straine, He would condemne his owne to fire againe. His youth a Solons wisdome did presage, Had envious Time but given him Solons age. Who would not therefore now, if Learnings friend, Bewaile his fatall and untimely end: Who hath such hard, such unrelenting Eyes, As would not weep when so much Vertue dyes? The God of Poets doth in darknesse shrowd His glorious face, and weepes behind a Cloud. The dolefull Muses thinking now to write Sad Elegies, their teares confound their sight: But him to Elysiums lasting Joyes they bring, Where winged Angels his sad Requiems sing. A. C. A DREAME OF ELYSIUM. Phœbus expuls'd by the a[pp]roaching Night Blush'd, and for shame clos'd in his bashfull light; Whilst I with leaden Morpheus overcome, The Muse, whom I adore, enterd the roome. Her hayre with looser curiositie, Did on her comely backe dishevel'd lye. Her Eyes with such attractive beauty shone, As might have wak'd sleeping Endymion. She bid me rise, and promis'd I should see Those Fields, those Mansions of Felicity, Wee mortalls so admire at: Speaking thus, She lifts me up upon wing'd Pegasus. On whom I rid: knowing where ever she Did goe, that place must needs a Tempe be. No sooner was my flying Courser come To the blest dwellings of Elysium: When straight a thousand unknowne joyes resort, And hemm'd me round: Chast loves innocuous sport. A thousand sweets, bought with no following Gall, Joyes, not like ours, short, but perpetuall. How many objects charme my wandring eye, And bid my soule gaze there eternally? Here in full streames, Bacchus thy liquor flowes, Nor knowes to ebbe: here Joves broad Tree bestowes Distilling hony, heere doth Nectar passe With copious current through the verdant Grasse. Here Hyacinth, his fate writ in his lookes, And thou Narcissus loving still the Brookes, Once lovely boyes; and Acis now a Flower, Are nourisht, with that rarer herbe, whose power Created thee, Warres potent God, here growes The spotlesse Lillie, and the blushing Rose. And all those divers ornaments abound, That variously may paint the gawdy ground. No Willow, sorrowes Garland, there hath roome, Nor Cypresse, sad attendant of a Tombe. None but Apollo's Tree, and th'Ivie Twine Imbracing the stout Oake, the fruitfull Vine, And Trees with golden Apples loaded downe, On whose faire toppes sweet Philomel alone, Unmindfull of her former miserie, Tunes with her voyce a ravishing Harmonie. Whilst all the murmuring Brookes that glide along, Make up a burthen to her pleasing Song. No Scritchowle, sad companion of the Night, Or hideous Raven with prodigious flight Presaging future ill. Nor, Progne, thee Yet spotted with young Itis Tragedie, Those Sacred Bowers receive. There's nothing there, That is not pure, immaculate, and rare. Turning my greedy sight another way, Under a row of storme-contemning Bay, I saw the Thracian Singer with his lyre Teach the deafe stones to heare him, and admire. Him the whole Poets Chorus compass'd round, All whom the Oake, all whom the Lawrell crown'd. There banish'd Ovid had a lasting home, Better than thou couldst give ingratefull Rome; And Lucan (spight of Nero) in each veine Had every drop of his spilt bloud againe: Homer, Sol's first borne, was not poore or blinde, But saw as well in body as in minde. Tullie, grave Cato, Solon, and the rest Of Greece's admir'd Wisemen, here possest A large reward for their past deeds, and gaine A life, as everlasting as their Fame. By these, the valiant Heroes take their place, All who sterne Death and perils did imbrace For Vertues cause. Great Alexander there Laughing at the Earth's small Empire, did weare A Nobler Crowne, than the whole world could give. There did Horatius Cocles, Sceva, live, And valiant Decius, who now freely cease From Warre, and purchase an eternall peace. Next them, beneath a Mirtle Bowre, where Doves, And gall-lesse Pidgeons build their nests, all Loves Faithfull perseverers, with amorous kisses, And soft imbraces, taste their greediest wishes. Leander with his beauteous Hero playes, Nor are they parted with dividing Seas. Porcia injoyes her Brutus, Death no more Can now divorce their Wedding, as before. Thisbe her Pyramus kiss'd, his Thisbe hee Embrac'd, each blest with th'others company. And every couple alwayes dancing, sing Eternall Ditties to Elysiums King. But see how soone these pleasures fade away, How neere to Evening is delights short Day? For th'watching Bird, true Nuncius of the Light Straight crowd: and all these vanisht from my sight. My very Muse her selfe forsooke mee too. Me griefe and wonder wak'd: What should I doe? Oh! let me follow thee (said I) and goe From life, that I may Dreame for ever so. With that my flying Muse I thought to claspe Within my armes, but did a shadow graspe. Thus chiefest Joyes glide with the swiftest streame, And all our greatest pleasure's but a Dreame. A. C. FINIS. SYLVA, OR, DIVERS COPIES OF VERSES, Made upon sundry occasions by A. C. On his Majesties returne out of Scotland. Great Charles: there stop you Trumpeters of Fame, (For he who speakes his Titles, his great Name Must have a breathing time,) Our King: stay there, Tel't by degrees, let the inquisitive eare Be held in doubt, and ere you say, Is come, Let every heart prepare a spatious roome For ample joyes: then Iö sing as loud As thunder shot from the divided cloud. Let Cygnus plucke from the Arabian waves The ruby of the rocke, the pearle that paves Great Neptunes Court, let every sparrow beare From the three Sisters weeping barke a teare. Let spotted Lynces their sharpe tallons fill With chrystall fetch'd from the Promethean hill. Let Cythereas birds fresh wreathes compose, Knitting the pale fac't Lillie with the Rose. Let the selfe-gotten Phœnix rob his nest, Spoile his owne funerall pile, and all his best Of Myrrhe, of Frankincense, of Cassia bring, To strew the way for our returned King. Let every post a Panegyricke weare, Each wall, each pillar gratulations beare: And yet let no man invocate a Muse; The very matter will it selfe infuse A sacred fury. Let the merry Bells (For unknowne joyes worke unknowne miracles) Ring without helpe of Sexton, and presage A new-made holy-day for future age. And if the Ancients us'd to dedicate A golden Temple to propitious fate, At the returne of any Noble men, Of Heroes, or of Emperours, wee must then Raise up a double Trophee, for their fame Was but the shadow of our CHARLES his name. Who is there where all vertues mingled flow? Where no defects, no imperfections grow? Whose head is alwayes crown'd with victory, Snatch'd from Bellonas hand, him luxury In peace debilitates, whose tongue can win, Tullies owne Garland, to him pride creeps in. On whom (like Atlas shoulders) the propt state (As he were Primum Mobile of fate) Solely, relies, him blind ambition moves, His tyranny the bridled subject proves. But all those vertues which they all possest Divided, are collected in thy brest, Great Charles; Let Cœsar boast P[ha]rsalias fight, Honorius praise the Parthians unfeyn'd fight. Let Alexander call himself Joves peere, And place his Image next the Thunderer, Yet whilst our Charles with equall ballance reignes 'Twixt Mercy and Astrea, and maintaines A noble peace, 'tis he, 'tis onely he Who is most neere, most like the Deitie. A Song on the same. Hence clouded lookes, hence briny teares Hence eye, that sorrows livery weares. What though a while Apollo please To visit the Antipodes? Yet he returnes, and with his light Expels, what he hath caus'd, the night. What though the spring vanish away, And with it the earths forme decay? Yet at's new birth it will restore What it's departure tooke before. What though we mist our absent King Erewhile? Great Charles is come agin, And, with his presence makes us know, The gratitude to Heaven wee owe. So doth a cruell storme impart And teach us Palinurus art. So from salt flouds, wept by our eyes, A joyfull Venus doth arise. A Vote. 1 Lest the misconstring world should chance to say, I durst not but in secret murmurs pray, To whisper in Joves eare, How much I wish that funerall, Or gape at such a great ones fall, This let all ages heare, And future times in my soules picture see What I abhorre, what I desire to bee. 2 I would not be a Puritan, though he Can preach two houres, and yet his Sermon be But halfe a quarter long, Though from his old mechanicke trade By vision hee's a Pastor made, His faith was growne so strong. Nay though he thinke to gaine salvation, By calling th'Pope the Whore of Babylon. 3 I would not be a School-master, though he His Rods no lesse than Fasces deemes to be, Though he in many a place, Turnes Lilly oftner than his gownes, Till at the last hee make the Nownes, Fight with the Verbes apace. Nay though he can in a Poeticke heat, Figures, borne since, out of poore Virgill beat. 4 I would not be Justice of Peace, though he Can with equality divide the Fee, And stakes with his Clarke draw. Nay though he sit upon the place Of Judgement with a learned face Intricate as the Law. And whilst he mulcts enormities demurely, Breaks Priscians head with sentences securely. 5 I would not be a Courtier, though he Makes his whole life the truest Comedy: Although he be a man In whom the Taylors forming Art, And nimble Barber claime more part Than Nature her selfe can. Though, as he uses men, 'tis his intent To put off death too, with a Complement. 6 From Lawyers tongues, though they can spin with ease The shortest cause into a Paraphrase, From Usurers conscience (For swallowing up young Heyres so fast Without all doubt, they'l choakt at last) Make me all innocence Good Heaven; and from thy eyes, ô Justice keepe, For though they be not blind, they're oft asleepe. 7 From Singing-mens Religion; who are Alwayes at Church just like the Crowes, 'cause there They build themselves a nest. From too much Poetry, which shines With gold in nothing but its lines, Free, ô you powers, my brest. And from Astronomy within the skies Finds fish, and bulls, yet doth but Tantalize. 8 From your Court-Madams beauty, which doth carry At morning May, at night a January. From the grave City brow (For though it want an R, it has The letter of Pythagoras) Keepe me ô Fortune now, And chines of beefe innumerable send me, Or from the stomacke of the Guard defend me. 9 This onely grant me: that my meanes may lye Too low for envie, for contempt too high. Some honour I would have, Not from great deeds, but good alone, Th'ignote are better than ill knowne R[u]mor can ope the grave. Acquaintance I would hug, but when't depends Not from the number, but the choyse of friends. 10 Bookes should, not businesse, entertaine the light, And sleepe, as undisturb'd as death the night. My house a cottage more Then palace, and should fitting be For all my use, no luxurie. My garden painted ore With natures hand, not arts and pleasures yield, Horace might envie in his Sabine field. 11 Thus would I double my lifes fading space, For he that runs it well, twice runs his race. And in this true delight, These unbought sports, and happy state, I would nor feare, nor wish my fate, But boldly say each night, To morrow let my Sunne his beames display, Or in clouds hide them; I have liv'd to day. A Poeticall Revenge. Westminster-Hall a friend and I agreed To meet in; hee (some busines 'twas did breed His absence) came not there; I up did goe, To the next Court for though I could not know Much what they meant, yet I might see and heare (As most spectators doe at Theater) Things very strange; Fortune did seeme to grace My comming there, and helpt me to a place. But being newly setled at the sport, A semi-gentleman of th'Innes of Court, In a Sattin suite, redeem'd but yesterday; One who is ravisht with a Cock-pit Play, Who prayes God to deliver him from no evill Besides a Taylors bill, and feares no Devill Besides a Serjeant, thrust me from my seat: At which I gan to quarrell, till a neat Man in a ruffe (whom therefore I did take For Barrister) open'd his mouth and spake; Boy, get you gone, this is no Schoole: Oh no; For if it were, all you gown'd-men would goe Up for false Latin: they grew straight to be Incenst, I fear'd they would have brought on me An Action of Trespas, till th'young man Aforesaid, in the Sattin suit, began To strike me: doubtlesse there had beene a fray, Had not I providently skipp'd away, Without replying; for to scould is ill, Where every tongue's the clapper of a Mill, And can out-sound Homers Gradivus; so Away got I: but ere I farre did goe, I flung (the Darts of wounding Poetrie) These two or three sharpe curses backe: May hee Be by his Father in his Study tooke At Shakespeares Playes, in stead of my L. Cooke. May hee (though all his Writings grow as soone As Butters out of estimation) Get him a Poets name, and so ne'r come Into a Sergeants, or dead Judges roome. May hee (for 'tis sinne in a Lawyer) True Latin use to speake, even at the Barre. May hee become some poore Physicians prey, Who keepes men with that conscience in delay As he his Clyents doth, till his health bee As farre fetch'd as a Greeke Nownes pedigree. Nay, for all that, may the disease be gone Never but in the long Vacation. May Neighbours use all Quarrels to decide; But if for Law any to London ride, Of all those Clyents may no one be his, Unlesse he come in Forma Pauperis. Grant this you Gods, that favour Poetry, That so at last these ceaselesse tongues may be Brought into reformation, and not dare To quarrell with a thredbare Black; but spare Them who beare Scholars names, lest some one take Spleene, and another Ignoramus make. To the Duchesse of Buckingham. If I should say, that in your face were seene Natures best Picture of the Cyprian Queene; If I should sweare under Minerva's Name, Poets (who Prophets are) fore-told your fame, The future age would thinke it flatterie, But to the present which can witnesse be, 'Twould seeme beneath your high deserts, as farre, As you above the rest of Women are. When Mannors name with Villiers joyn'd I see, How doe I reverence your Nobilitie! But when the vertues of your Stock I view, (Envi'd in your dead Lord, admir'd in you) I halfe adore them: for what woman can Besides your selfe (nay I might say what man) Both Sexe, and Birth, and Fate, and yeeres excell In minde, in fame, in worth, in living well? Oh, how had this begot Idolatrie, If you had liv'd in the Worlds infancie, When mans too much Religion, made the best Or Deities, or Semi-gods at least? But wee, forbidden this by pietie, Or, if wee were not, by your modestie, Will make our hearts an Altar, and there pray Not to, but for you, nor that England may Enjoy your equall, when you once are gone, But what's more possible, t'enjoy you long. To his very much honoured Godfather, Master A. B. I love (for that upon the wings of Fame Shall perhaps mock Death or times Darts) my Name. I love it more, because 'twas given by you; I love it most, because 'twas your name too. For if I chance to slip, a conscious shame Plucks me, and bids me not defile your name. I'm glad that Citie t'whom I ow'd before, (But ah me! Fate hath crost that willing Score) A Father, gave me a Godfather too, And I'm more glad, because it gave me you; Whom I may rightly thinke, and terme to be Of the whole Citie an Epitomie. I thanke my carefull Fate, which found out one (When Nature had not licenced my tongue Farther then cryes) who should my office doe; I thanke her more, because shee found out you: In whose each looke, I may a sentence see; In whose each deed, a teaching Homily. How shall I pay this debt to you? My Fate Denyes me Indian Pearle or Persian Plate. Which though it did not, to requite you thus, Were to send Apples to Alcinoüs, And sell the cunning'st way: No, when I can In every Leafe, in every Verse write Man, When my Quill relisheth a Schoole no more, When my pen-feather'd Muse hath learnt to soare, And gotten wings as well as feet; looke then For equall thankes from my unwearied Pen: Till future ages say; 'twas you did give A name to me, and I made yours to live. An Elegie on the Death of M??? Anne Whitfield. Shee's dead, and like the houre that stole her hence, With as much quietnesse and innocence. And 'tis as difficult a taske to winne Her travelling soule backe to its former Inne, As force that houre, fled without tract away, To turne, and stop the current of the day. What, shall we weepe for this? and cloath our eye With sorrow, the Graves mourning Liverie? Or shall we sigh? and with that pious winde Drive faster on what we alreadie finde Too swift for us, her soule? No; shee who dy'de Like the sicke Sunne, when Night entombes his pride; Or Trees in Autumne, when unseene decay And slow consumption steales the leaves away, Without one murmur, shewes that she did see Death as a good, not as a miserie. And so she went to undiscovered Fields, From whence no path hope of returning yeelds To any Traveller, and it must be Our solace now to court her memorie. Wee'l tell how love was dandled in her eye, Yet curb'd with a beseeming gravitie. And how (beleeve it you that heare or reade) Beautie and Chastitie met and agreed In her, although a Courtier: Wee will tell How farre her noble spirit did excell Hers, nay our Sexe: wee will repeat her Name, And force the Letters to an Anagram. Whitfield wee'l cry, and amorous windes shall be Ready to snatch that words sweet harmonie Ere 'tis spoke out: Thus wee must dull griefes sting, And cheat the sorrow that her losse would bring: Thus in our hearts wee'l bury her, and there Wee'l write, Here lyes Whitfield the chast, and faire. Art may no doubt a statelier Tombe invent, But not like this, a living Monument. An Elegie on the Death of John Littleton Esquire, Sonne and Heire to Sir Thomas Littleton, who was drowned leaping into the water to save his younger Brother. And must these waters smile againe? and play About the shore, as they did yesterday? Will the Sun court them still? and shall they show No conscious wrinckle furrowed on their brow, That to the thirsty Travellor may say, I am accurst, goe turne some other way? It is unjust; black floud, thy guilt is more, Sprung from his losse, then all thy watry store Can give thee teares to mourne for: Birds shall bee And Beasts henceforth afraid to drinke of thee. What have I said? my pious rage hath beene Too hot, and acts whilst it accuseth sinne. Thou'rt innocent I know, still cleare, and bright, Fit whence so pure a soule should take it's flight. How is my angry zeale confin'd? for hee Must quarrell with his love and pietie, That would revenge his death. Oh I shall sinne, And wish anon he had lesse vertuous beene. For when his Brother (teares for him I'de spill, But they're all challeng'd by the greater ill) Strugled for life with the rude waves, he too Leapt in, and when hope no faint beame could show, His charitie shone most; thou shalt, said hee, Live with me, Brother, or Ile dye with thee; And so he did: had he beene thine, ô Rome, Thou wouldst have call'd this death a Martyrdome, And Saynted him; my conscience give me leave, Ile doe so too: if fate will us bereave Of him we honour'd living, there must be A kinde of reverence to his memorie, After his death: and where more just then here, Where life and end were both so singuler? Of which th'one griefe, the other imitation Of all men vindicates, both admiration. He that had onely talkt with him, might finde A little Academie in his minde; Where Wisedome, Master was, and Fellowes all Which we can good, which we can vertuous call. Reason and Holy Feare the Proctors were, To apprehend those words, those thoughts that erre. His learning had out-run the rest of heyres, Stolne Beard from time, and leapt to twentie yeares. And as the Sunne, though in full glorie bright, Shines upon all men with impartiall light, And a good morrow to the begger brings With as full rayes as to the mightiest Kings: So he, although his worth just state might claime, And give to pride an honourable name, With curtesie to all, cloath'd vertue so, That 'twas not higher then his thoughts were low. In's body too, no Critique eye could finde The smallest blemish, to belye his minde; He was all purenesse, and his outward part The looking-glasse and picture of his heart. When waters swallow'd mankinde, and did cheat The hungry Worme of its expected meat; When gemmes, pluckt from the shore by ruder hands, Return'd againe unto their native sands; 'Mongst all those spoyles, there was not any prey Could equall what this Brooke hath stolne away. Weepe then, sad Floud; and though thou'rt innocent, Weepe because fate made thee her instrument: And when long griefe hath drunke up all thy store, Come to our eyes, and we will lend thee more. A translation of Verses upon the B. Virgin, written in Latine by the right Worshipfull Dr. A. Ave Maria. Once thou rejoycedst, and rejoyce for ever, Whose time of joy shall be expired never: Who in her wombe the Hive of Comfort beares, Let her drinke Comforts Honey with her eares. You brought the word of joy, which did impart An Haile to all, let us An Haile redart. From you God save into the World there came; Our Eccho Haile is but an empty name. Gratia Plena. How loaded Hives are with their Honie fill'd, From diverse Flowres by Chimicke Bees distill'd: How full the Collet with his Jewell is, Which, that it cannot take, by love doth kisse: How full the Moone is with her Brothers ray, When shee drinks up with thirsty orbe the day, How full of Grace the Graces dances are, So full doth Mary of Gods light appeare. It is no wonder if with Graces she Be full, who was full with the Deitie. Dominus tecum. The fall of mankind under deaths extent The quire of blessed Angels did lament, And wisht a reparation to see By him, who manhood joyn'd with Deitie. How gratefull should Mans safety then appeare T'himselfe, whose safety can the Angels cheare? Benedicta tu in mulieribus. Death came, and troopes of sad diseases led To th'earth, by womans hand solicited. Life came so too, and troopes of Graces led To th'earth, by womans faith solicited. As our lifes spring came from thy blessed wombe, So from our mouthes springs of thy praise shall come. Who did lifes blessing give, 'tis fit that she Above all women should thrice blessed be. Et benedictus fructus ventris tui. With mouth divine the Father doth protest, Hee a good word sent from his stored brest, 'Twas Christ: which Mary without carnall thought, From the unfathom'd depth of goodnesse brought, The word of blessing a just cause affoords, To be oft blessed with redoubled words. Spiritus Sanctus superveniet in te. As when soft West winds strooke the Garden Rose, A showre of sweeter ayre salutes the Nose. The breath gives sparing kisses, nor with powre Unlocks the Virgin bosome of the Flowre. So th'Holy Spirit upon Mary blow'd, And from her sacred Box whole rivers flow'd. Yet loos'd not thine eternall chastity, Thy Roses folds doe still entangled lye. Beleeve Christ borne from an unbruised wombe, So from unbruised Barke the Odors come. Et virtus altissimi obumbrabit tibi. God his great Sonne begot ere time begunne, Mary in time brought forth her little Sonne. Of double substance, one, life hee began, God without Mother, without Father Man. Great is this birth, and 'tis a stranger deed, That shee no man, then God no wife should need. A shade delighted the Child-bearing Maid, And God himselfe became to her a shade. O strange descent! who is lights Author, hec Will to his creature thus a shadow bee. As unseene light did from the Father flow, So did seene light from Virgin Marie grow. When Moses sought God in a shade to see, The Fathers shade was, Christ the Deitie. Let's seeke for day we darknesse, whil'st our sight In light findes darknesse, and in darknesse light. ODE I. On the praise of Poetry. 'Tis not a Pyramide of Marble stone, Though high as our ambition, 'Tis not a Tombe cut out in Brasse, which can Give life to th'ashes of a man, But Verses onely; they shall fresh appeare, Whil'st there are men to reade, or heare. When Time shall make the lasting Brasse decay, And eate the Pyramide away, Turning that Monument wherein men trust Their names, to what it keepes, poore dust: Then shall the Epitaph remaine, and be New graven in Eternitie. Poets by death are conquered, but the wit Of Poets triumph over it. What cannot Verse? When Thracian Orpheus tooke His Lyre, and gently on it strooke, The learned stones came dancing all along, And kept time to the charming song. With artificiall pace the Warlike Pine, Th'Elme, and his Wife the Ivy twine, With all the better trees, which erst had stood Unmov'd, forsooke their native Wood. The Lawrell to the Poets hand did bow, Craving the honour of his brow: And every loving arme embrac'd, and made With their officious leaves a shade. The beasts too strove his auditors to be, Forgetting their old Tyrannie. The fearefull Hart next to the Lion came, And Wolfe was Shepheard to the Lambe. Nightingales, harmlesse Syrens of the ayre, And Muses of the place, were there. Who when their little windpipes they had found Unequall to so strange a sound, O'recome by art and griefe they did expire, And fell upon the conquering Lyre. Happy, ô happy they, whose Tombe might be, Mausolus, envied by thee! ODE II. That a pleasant Poverty is to be preferred before discontented Riches. 1 Why ô doth gaudy Tagus ravish thee, Though Neptunes Treasure-house it be? Why doth Pactolus thee bewitch, Infected yet with Midas glorious Itch? 2 Their dull and sleepie streames are not at all Like other Flouds, Poeticall, They have no dance, no wanton sport, No gentle murmur, the lov'd shore to court. 3 No Fish inhabite the adulterate Floud, Nor can it feed the neighbouring Wood, No Flower or Herbe is neere it found, But a perpetuall Winter sterves the ground. 4 Give me a River which doth scorne to shew An added beauty, whose cleere brow May be my looking-glasse, to see What my face is, and what my mind should be. 5 Here waves call waves, and glide along in ranke, And prattle to the smiling banke. Here sad King fishers tell their tales, And fish enrich the Brooke with silver scales. 6 Dasyes the first borne of the teeming Spring, On each side their embrodery bring, Here Lillies wash, and grow more white, And Daffadills to see themselves delight. 7 Here a fresh Arbor gives her amorous shade, Which Nature, the best Gard'ner made. Here I would set, and sing rude layes, Such as the Nimphs and me my selfe should please. 8 Thus I would waste, thus end my carelesse dayes, And Robin-red-brests whom men praise For pious birds, should when I dye, Make both my Monument and Elegie. ODE III. To his Mistris. 1 Tyrian dye why doe you weare You whose cheekes best scarlet are? Why doe you fondly pin Pure linnens ore your skin, Your skin that's whiter farre, Casting a duskie cloud before a Starre? 2 Why beares your necke a golden chayne? Did Nature make your haire in vaine, Of Gold most pure and fine? With gemmes why doe you shine? They, neighbours to your eyes, Shew but like Phosphor, when the Sunne doth rise. 3 I would have all my Mistris parts, Owe more to Nature then to Arts, I would not woe the dresse, Or one whose nights give lesse Contentment, then the day. Shee's faire, whose beauty onely makes her gay. 4 For 'tis not buildings make a Court Or pompe, but 'tis the Kings resort: If Jupiter downe powre Himselfe, and in a showre Hide such bright Majestie Lesse then a golden one it cannot be. ODE IV. On the uncertainty of Fortune. A Translation. Leave off unfit complaints, and cleere From sighs your brest, and from black clouds your brow, When the Sunne shines not with his wonted cheere, And Fortune throwes an adverse cast for you. That Sea which vext with Notus is, The merry Eastwinds will to morrow kisse. The Sunne to day rides drousily, To morrow 'twill put on a looke more faire, Laughter and groaning doe alternately Returne, and teares sports neerest neighbours are. 'Tis by the Gods appointed so That good fate should with mingled dangers flow. Who drave his Oxen yesterday, Doth now over the Noblest Romanes reigne. And on the Gabii, and the Cures lay The yoake which from his Oxen he had tane. Whom Hesperus saw poore and low, The mornings eye beholds him greatest now. If Fortune knit amongst her play But seriousnesse; he shall againe goe home To his old Country Farme of yesterday, To scoffing people no meane jest become. And with the crowned Axe, which he Had rul'd the World, goe backe and prune some Tree. Nay if he want the fuell cold requires, With his owne Fasces he shall make him fires. ODE V. In commendation of the time we live under the Reign of our gracious K. Charles. 1 Curst be that wretch (Deaths Factor sure) who brought Dire Swords into the peacefull world, and taught Smiths, who before could onely make The Spade, the Plowshare, and the Rake; Arts, in most cruell wise Mans life t'epitomize. 2 Then men (fond men alas) rid post to th'grave, And cut those threads, which yet the Fates would save. Then Charon sweated at his trade, And had a bigger Ferry made, Then, then the silver hayre, Frequent before, grew rare. 3 Then Revenge married to Ambition, Begat blacke Warre, then Avarice crept on. Then limits to each field were strain'd, And Terminus a Godhead gain'd. To men before was found, Besides the Sea, no bound. 4 In what Playne or what River hath not beene Warres story, writ in blood (sad story) seene? This truth too well our England knowes, 'Twas civill slaughter dy'd her Rose: Nay then her Lillie too, With bloods losse paler grew. 5 Such griefes, nay worse than these, we now should feele, Did not just Charles silence the rage of steele; He to our Land blest peace doth bring, All Neighbour Countries envying. Happy who did remaine Unborne till Charles his reigne! 6 Where dreaming Chimicks is you[r] paine and cost? How is your oyle, how is your labour lost? Our Charles, blest Alchymist (though strange, Beleeve it future times) did change The Iron age of old, Into an age of Gold. ODE VI. Upon the shortnesse of Mans life. Marke that swift Arrow how it cuts the ayre, How it out-runnes thy hunting eye, Use all perswasions now, and try If thou canst call it backe, or stay it there. That way it went, but thou shalt find No tract of 't left behind. Foole 'tis thy life, and the fond Archer, thou, Of all the time thou'st shot away Ile bid thee fetch but yesterday, And it shall be too hard a taske to doe. Besides repentance, what canst find That it hath left behind? Our life is carried with too strong a tyde, A doubtfull Cloud our substance beares, And is the Horse of all our yeares. Each day doth on a winged whirle-wind ride. Wee and our Glasse run out, and must Both render up our dust. But his past life who without griefe can see, Who never thinkes his end too neere, But sayes to Fame, thou art mine Heire. That man extends lifes naturall brevity, This is, this is the onely way T' out-live Nestor in a day. An Answer to an Invitation to Cambridge. 1 Nichols, my better selfe, forbeare, For if thou telst what Cambridge pleasures are, The Schoole-boyes sinne will light on me, I shall in mind at least a Truant be. Tell me not how you feed your minde With dainties of Philosophy, In Ovids Nut I shall not finde, The taste once pleased me. O tell me not of Logicks diverse cheare, I shall begin to loath our Crambe here. 2 Tell me not how the waves appeare Of Cam, or how it cuts the learned shiere, I shall contemne the troubled Thames, On her chiefe Holiday, even when her streames, Are with rich folly guilded, when The quondam Dungboat is made gay, Just like the bravery of the men, And graces with fresh paint that day: When th' Citie shines with Flagges and Pageants there, And Sattin Doublets, seen not twice a yeere. 3 Why doe I stay then? I would meet Thee there, but plummets hang upon my feet: 'Tis my chiefe wish to live with thee, But not till I deserve thy company: Till then wee'l scorne to let that toy, Some forty miles, divide our hearts: Write to me, and I shall enjoy, Friendship, and wit, thy better parts. Though envious Fortune larger hindrance brings, Wee'l easely see each other, Love hath wings. The three-volume edition of Cowley's works published in 1711 contains, at the end of Sylva, the following verses: To a Lady who desired a Song of Mr. Cowley, he presented this following. Come, Poetry, and with you bring along A rich and painted Throng Of noblest Words into my Song. Into my Numbers let them gently flow, Soft and pure, and thick as Snow, And turn thy Numbers still to prove Smooth as the smoothest Sphere above, And like a Sphere, like a Sphere, harmoniously move. Little dost thou, vain Song, thy Fortune know, What thou art destin'd to, And what the Stars intend to do. Among a thousand Songs but few can be Born to the Honour promis'd thee. Eliza's self shall thee receive, And a blest Being to thee give, Thou on her sweet and tuneful Voice shalt live. Her warbling Tongue shall freely with thee play, Thou on her Lips shalt stray, And dance upon the rosie Way. No Prince alive that would not envy thee, And count thee happier far than he. And how shalt thou thy Author crown! When fair Eliza shall be known To sing thy Praise, when she but speaks her own. FINIS. LOVES RIDDLE. A PASTORALL COMÆDIE; Written, At the time of his being Kings Scholler in Westminster Schoole, by A. Cowley. Epilogue Spoken by Alupis. The Author bid me tell you—'faith, I have Forgot what 'twas; and I'me a very slave If I know what to say; but only this, Bee merry, that my counsell alwayes is. Let no grave man knit up his brow, and say, 'Tis foolish: why? 'twas a Boy made the Play. Nor any yet of those that sit behind, Because he goes in Plush, be of his mind. Let none his Time, or his spent money grieve, Bee merry; Give me your hands, and I'le believe. Or if you will not, I'le goe in, and see, If I can turne the Authors mind, with mee To sing away the day, For 'tis but a folly To bee melancholy Since that can't mend the Play. A SATYRE. THE PURITAN AND THE PAPIST. So two rude waves, by stormes together throwne, Roare at each other, fight, and then grow one. Religion is a Circle; men contend, And runne the round in dispute without end. Now in a Circle who goe contrary, Must at the last meet of necessity. The Roman to advance the Catholicke cause Allowes a Lie, and calls it Pia Fraus. The Puritan approves and does the same, Dislikes nought in it but the Latin name. He flowes with these devises, and dares ly In very deed, in truth, and verity. He whines, and sighes out Lies, with so much ruth, As if he griev'd, 'cause he could ne're speake truth. Lies have possest the Presse so, as their due, 'Twill scarcely, 'I feare, henceforth print Bibles true. Lies for their next strong Fort ha'th' Pulpit chose, There throng out at the Preachers mouth, and nose. And how e're grosse, are certaine to beguile The poore Booke-turners of the middle Isle. Nay to th' Almighty's selfe they have beene bold To ly, and their blasphemous Minister told They might say false to God, for if they were Beaten, he knew't not, for he was not there. But God, who their great thankefulnesse did see, Rewards them straight with another Victorie, Just such another at Brainceford; and san's doubt Will weary er't be long their gratitude out. Not all the Legends of the Saints of old, Not vast Baronius, nor sly Surius hold Such plenty of apparent Lies, as are In your one Author, Jo. Browne Cleric. Par. Besides what your small Poets have said, or writ, Brookes, Strode, and the Baron of the Saw-pit: With many a Mentall Reservation, You'le maintaine Liberty, Reserv'd [your owne.] For th' publique good the summes rais'd you'le disburse; Reserv'd, [The greater part for your owne purse.] You'le root the Cavaliers out, every man; Faith, let it be reserv'd here; [If yee can.] You'le make our gracious Charles, a glorious King; Reserv'd [in Heaven,] for thither ye would bring His Royall Head; the onely secure roome For glorious Kings, whither you'le never come. To keepe the estates o'th' Subjects you pretend; Reserv'd [in your owne Trunkes;] you will defend The Church of England, 'tis your Protestation; But that's New-England, by'a small Reservation. Power of dispensing Oaths the Papists claime; Case hath got leave o' God, to doe the same. For you doe hate all swearing so, that when You have sworne an Oath, ye breake it streight agen. A Curse upon you! which hurts most these Nations, Cavaliers swearing, or your Protestations? Nay, though Oaths by you be so much abhorr'd, Ye allow God damne me in the Puritan Lord. They keepe the Bible from Lay-men, but ye Avoid this, for ye have no Laytie. They in a forraigne, and unknowne tongue pray, You in an unknowne sence your prayers say: So that this difference 'twixt ye does ensue, Fooles understand not them, nor Wise men you. They an unprofitable zeale have got, Of invocating Saints that heare them not. 'Twere well you did so; nought may more be fear'd In your fond prayers, then that they should be heard. To them your Non-sence well enough might passe, They'd ne're see that i'th' Divine Looking-glasse: Nay, whether you'de worship Saints is not yet knowne, For ye'have as yet of your Religion none. They by good-workes thinke to be justified, You into the same errour deeper slide; You thinke by workes too justified to be, And those ill workes, Lies, Treason, Perjurie. But oh your faith is mighty, that hath beene, As true faith ought to be, of things unseene. At Worc'ster, Brainceford, and Edge hill, we see, Onely by faith you'have gotten victory. Such is your faith, and some such unseene way The publique faith at last your debts will pay. They hold free-will (that nought their soules may bind) As the great Priviledge of all mankind. You're here more moderate, for 'tis your intent, To make't a Priv'ledge but of Parliament. They forbid Priests to marry; you worse doe, Their Marriage you allow, yet punish too: For you'de make Priests so poore, that upon all Who marry, scorne and beggery must fall. They a bold power o're sacred Scriptures take, Blot out some Clauses, and some new ones make. Your great Lord Jesuite Brookes publiquely said, (Brookes whom too little learning hath made mad) That to correct the Creed ye should doe well, And blot out Christs descending into Hell. Repent wild man, or you'le ne're change, I feare, The sentence of your owne descending there. Yet modestly they use the Creed, for they Would take the Lords prayer Root and Branch away. And wisely said a Levit of our nation, The Lords Prayer was a Popish Innovation. Take heed, you'le grant ere long it should be said, An't be but to desire your daily Bread. They keepe the people ignorant, and you Keepe both the People, and yourselves so too. They blind obedience and blind duty teach; You blind Rebellion and blind faction preach. Nor can I blame you much, that yee advance That which can onely save yee, Ignorance; Though Heaven be praysed, t'has oft beene proved well Your Ignorance is not Invincible. Nay such bold lies to God him selfe yee vaunt, As if you'd faine keepe him too ignorant. Limbus and Purgatory they beleive For lesser sinners, that is, I conceive, Malignants onely; you this Tricke does please, For the same Cause ye'have made new Limbuses, Where we may ly imprison'd long ere we A day of Judgement in your Courts shall see. But Pym can, like the Pope with this dispence; And for a Bribe deliver Soules from thence. Their Councels claime Infallibility, Such must your Conventicle-synod be; And Teachers from all Parts of th' Earth yee call, To mak't a Councell Oecumenicall. They sev'rall times appoint from meats t'abstaine; You now for th' Irish warres a Fast ordaine; And that that Kingdome might be sure to fast Yee take a Course to sterve them all at last. Nay though yee keepe no Eves, Fridayes, nor Lent, Not to dresse meate on Sundayes you're Content; Then you repeat, repeat, and pray, and pray; Your Teeth keepe Sabboth, and Tongues working day. They preserve Reliques; you have few or none, Unlesse the Clout sent to John Pym be one. And Hollises rich Widow, Shee who carryed A Relique in her wombe before she married. They in succeeding Peter take a Pride; So doe you; for your Master ye'have denyed. But cheifely Peters Priviledge yee choose, At your own wills to bind and to unloose. He was a Fisherman; you may be so too, When nothing but your ships are left to you. He went to Rome, to Rome you Backward ride, (Though both your goings are by some denyed.) Nor i'st a Contradiction, if we say, You goe to Rome the quite Contrary way; He dy'd o'the Crosse; that death's unusuall now; The Gallowes is most like't, and that's for you. They musicke love i'th Church; it offends your sence, And therefore yee have sung it out from thence, Which shewes, if right your mind be understood, You hate it not as Musicke, but as Good. Your madnesse makes you sing, as much as they Dance, who are bit with a Tarantula. But do not to your selves (alas) appeare The most Religious Traitors that ere were, Because your Troopes singing of Psalmes do goe; Ther's many a Traytor has marcht Holbourn so. Nor was't your wit this holy project bore; Tweed and the Tyne has seene those Trickes before. They of strange Miracles and wonders tell, You are your selves a kind of Miracle; Even such a miracle as in writ divine We read o'th Devills hurrying downe the Swine. They have made Images to speake, 'tis said, You a dull Image have your Speaker made; And that your bounty in offerings might abound, Y'have to that Idoll giv'n six thousand pound. They drive out Devills, they say; here yee begin To differ, I confesse; you let them in. They maintaine Transubstantiation; You by a Contrary Philosophers stone, To Transubstantiate Mettalls, have the skill; And turne the Kingdomes Gold to I'ron and Steele. I'th' Sacrament yee agree not, but 'tis noted, Bread must be Flesh, Wine Bloud, if ere't be voted. They make the Pope their Head, you'exalt for him Primate and Metropolitane, Master Pym; Nay, White, who sits in the Infallible Chaire, And most Infallibly speakes Non-sence there: Nay Cromwell, Pury, Whistler, Sir John Wray, He who does say, and say, and say, and say. Nay Lowry, who does new Church-Gover'ment wish, And Prophesies, like Jonas, midst the Fish. Who can such various businesse wisely sway, And handle Herrings, and Bishops in one day. Nay all your Preachers, Women, Boyes, or Men, From Master Calamy, to Mistresse Ven, Are perfect Popes in their owne Parish growne; For to outdoe the story of Pope Jone: Your Women preach too, and are like to bee The Whores of Babylon, as much as Shee. They depose Kings by force; by force you'de doe it, But first use faire meanes to perswade them to it. They dare kill Kings; now 'twixt ye here's the strife, That you dare shoot at Kings, to save their life. And what's the difference, 'pray, whether he fall By the Popes Bull or your Oxe Generall? Three Kingdomes thus ye strive to make your owne; And, like the Pope, usurpe a Triple Crowne. Such is your Faith, such your Religion; Let's view your manners now, and then I ha' done. Your Covetousnesse let gasping Ireland tell, Where first the Irish Lands, and next ye sell The English Bloud; and raise Rebellion here, With that which should suppresse, and quench it there. What mighty summes have ye squeez'd out o'th' City? Enough to make 'em poore, and something witty. Excise, Loanes, Contributions, Pole-moneys, Bribes, Plunder, and such Parliament Priviledges, Are words which you'le ne're learne in holy Writ, 'Till the Spirit and your Synod ha's mended it. Where's all the Twentieth part now, which hath beene Paid you by some, to forfeit the Nineteene? Where's all the Goods distrain'd, and Plunders past? For you're growne wretched, pilfering knaves at last; Descend to Brasse and Pewter; till of late, Like Midas, all ye toucht, must needs be Plate. By what vast hopes is your Ambition fed? 'Tis writ in bloud, and may be plainly read. You must have Places, and the Kingdome sway; The King must be a Ward to your Lord Say. Your innocent Speaker to the Rolles must rise, Six thousand pound hath made him proud and wise. Kimbolton for his Fathers place doth call; Would be like him; would he were, face and all. Isaack would alwayes be Lord Mayor, and so May alwayes be, as much as he is now. For the Five Members, they so richly thrive, They'le but continue alwayes Members Five. Onely Pym doth his naturall right enforce, By the Mothers side he's Master of the Horse. Most shall have Places by these popular tricks, The rest must be content with Bishopricks. For 'tis 'gainst Superstition your intent, First to root out that great Church Ornament, Money and Lands; your swords, alas, are drawne, Against the Bishop, not his Cap, or Lawne. O let not such loud Sacriledge begin, Tempted by Henries rich successefull sinne. Henry the Monster King of all that age; Wilde in his Lust, and wilder in his Rage. Expect not you his Fate, though Hotham thrives In imitating Henries tricke for Wives, Nor fewer Churches hopes then Wives to see Buried, and then their Lands his owne to bee. Ye boundlesse Tyr[a]nts, how doe you outvy Th' Athenian Thirty, Romes Decemviri? In Rage, Injustice, Cruelty as farre Above those men, as you in number are. What Mysteries of Iniquity doe we see? New Prisons made to defend Libertie; Where without cause, some are undone, some dy, Like men bewitcht, they know not how, nor why. Our Goods forc'd from us for Propriety's sake; And all the Reall Non-sence which ye make. Ship-money was unjustly ta'ne, ye say; Unjustlier farre you take the Ships away. The High-Commission you calld Tyrannie, Ye did; Good God! what is the High-Committee? Ye said that gifts and bribes Preferments bought, By Money and Bloud too, they now are sought. To the Kings will the Lawes men strove to draw; The Subjects will is now become the Law. 'Twas fear'd a New Religion would begin; All new Religions now are entred in. The King Delinquents to protect did strive; What Clubs, Pikes, Halberts, Lighters, sav'd the Five? You thinke the Parliament, like your State of Grace, What ever sinnes men doe, they keepe their place. Invasions then were fear'd against the State, And Strode swore that last yeare would be 'Eighty-Eight. You bring in Forraine aid to your designes; First those great Forraine Forces of Divines, With which Ships from America were fraught; Rather may stinking Tobacco still be brought From thence, I say; next ye the Scots invite, Which ye terme Brotherly Assistants right; For with them you intend England to share: They, who, alas, but younger Brothers are, Must have the Monies for their Portion; The Houses and the Lands will be your owne. We thanke ye for the wounds which we endure, Whil'st scratches and slight pricks ye seeke to cure. We thanke ye for true reall feares at last, Which free us from so ma[n]y false ones past. We thanke ye for the Bloud which fats our Coast, (That fatall debt paid to great Straffords Ghost.) We thanke ye for the ills receiv'd, and all Which by your diligence in good time we shall. We thanke ye, and our gratitude's as great As yours, when you thank'd God for being beat. A. C. FINIS. A DISCOURSE By way of VISION, Concerning the Government of Oliver Cromwell. The following verse has been extracted from the prose of this discourse. [Ah, happy Isle, how art thou chang'd and curst] 1 Ah, happy Isle, how art thou chang'd and curst, Since I was born, and knew thee first! When Peace, which had forsook the World around, (Frighted with noise, and the shrill Trumpets sound) Thee for a private place of rest, And a secure retirement chose Wherein to build her Halcyon Nest; No wind durst stir abroad the Air to discompose. 2 When all the riches of the Globe beside Flow'd in to Thee with every Tide; When all that Nature did thy Soil deny, The Growth was of thy fruitfull Industry, When all the proud and dreadfull Sea, And all his Tributary-streams, A constant Tribute paid to Thee. When all the liquid World was one extended Thames. 3 When Plenty in each Village did appear, And Bounty was it's Steward there; When Gold walkt free about in open view, Ere it one Conquering parties Prisoner grew; When the Religion of our State Had Face and Substance with her Voice, Ere she by 'er foolish Loves of late, Like Eccho (once a Nymph) turn'd onely into Noise. 4 When Men to Men respect and friendship bore, And God with Reverence did adore; When upon Earth no Kingdom could have shown A happier Monarch to us than our own, And yet his Subjects by him were (Which is a Truth will hardly be Receiv'd by any vulgar Ear, A secret known to few) made happi'r ev'n than He. 5 Thou doest a Chaos, and Confusion now, A Babel, and a Bedlam grow, And like a Frantick person thou doest tear The Ornaments and Cloaths which thou shouldst wear, And cut thy Limbs; and if we see (Just as thy Barbarous Britons did) Thy Body with Hypocrisie Painted all o're, thou think'st, Thy naked shame is hid. 6 The Nations, which envied thee erewhile, Now laugh (too little 'tis to smile) They laugh, and would have pitty'd thee (alas!) But that thy Faults all Pity do surpass. Art thou the Country which didst hate, And mock the French Inconstancy? And have we, have we seen of late Less change of Habits there, than Governments in Thee? 7 Unhappy Isle! No ship of thine at Sea, Was ever tost and torn like thee. Thy naked Hulk loose on the Waves does beat, The Rocks and Banks around her ruin threat; What did thy foolish Pilots ail, To lay the Compass quite aside? Without a Law or Rule to sail, And rather take the winds, then Heavens to be their Guide? 8 Yet, mighty God, yet, yet, we humbly crave, This floating Isle from shipwrack save; And though to wash that Bloud which does it stain, It well deserves to sink into the Main; Yet for the Royal Martyr's prayer (The Royal Martyr pray's we know) This guilty, perishing Vessel spare; Hear but his Soul above, and not his bloud below. [Curst be the Man (what do I wish? as though] 1 Curst be the Man (what do I wish? as though The wretch already were not so; But curst on let him be) who thinks it brave And great, his Countrey to enslave. Who seeks to overpoise alone The Balance of a Nation; Against the whole but naked State, Who in his own light Scale makes up with Arms the weight. 2 Who of his Nation loves to be the first, Though at the rate of being worst. Who would be rather a great Monster, than A well-proportion'd Man. The Son of Earth with hundred hands Upon his three-pil'd Mountain stands, Till Thunder strikes him from the sky; The Son of Earth again in his Earths womb does lie. 3 What Bloud, Confusion, Ruine, to obtain A short and miserable Reign? In what oblique and humble creeping wise Does the mischievous Serpent rise? But even his forked Tongue strikes dead, When h'as rear'd up his wicked Head, He murders with his mortal frown, A Basilisk he grows if once he get a Crown. 4 But no Guards can oppose assaulting Ears, Or undermining Tears. No more than doors, or close-drawn Curtains keep The swarming Dreams out when we sleep. That bloudy Conscience too of his (For, oh, a Rebel Red-Coat 'tis) Does here his early Hell begin, He sees his Slaves without, his Tyrant feels within. 5 Let, Gracious God, let never more thine hand Lift up this rod against our Land. A Tyrant is a Rod and Serpent too, And brings worse Plagues than Egypt knew. What Rivers stain'd with blood have been? What Storm and Hail-shot have we seen? What Sores deform'd the Ulcerous State? What darkness to be felt has buried us of late? 6 How has it snatcht our Flocks and Herds away? And made even of our Sons a prey? What croaking Sects and Vermin has it sent The restless Nation to torment? What greedy Troups, what armed power Of Flies and Locusts to devour The Land which every where they fill? Nor flie they, Lord, away; no, they devour it still. 7 Come the eleventh Plague, rather than this should be; Come sink us rather in the Sea. Come rather Pestilence and reap us down; Come Gods sword rather than our own. Let rather Roman come again, Or Saxon, Norman, or the Dane, In all the bonds we ever bore, We griev'd, we sigh'd, we wept; we never blusht before. 8 If by our sins the Divine Justice be Call'd to this last extremity, Let some denouncing Jonas first be sent, To try if England can repent. Methinks at least some Prodigy, Some dreadful Comet from on high, Should terribly forewarn the Earth, As of good Princes Deaths, so of a Tyrants birth. [It is a Truth so certain, and so clear] It is a Truth so certain, and so clear, That to the first-born Man it did appear; Did not, the mighty Heir, the noble Cain, By the fresh Laws of Nature taught, disdain That (though a Brother) any one should be A greater Favourite to God than He? He strook him down; and, so (said He) so fell The Sheep which thou didst Sacrifice so well. Since all the fullest Sheaves which I could bring, Since all were Blasted in the Offering, Lest God should my next Victime too despise, The acceptable Priest I'le Sacrifice. Hence Coward Fears; for the first Blood so spilt As a Reward, He the first City built. 'Twas a beginning generous and high, Fit for a Grand-Child of the Deity. So well advanc'd, 'twas pity there he staid; One step of Glory more he should have made, And to the utmost bounds of Greatness gone; Had Adam too been kill'd, He might have Reign'd Alone. One Brother's death, What do I mean to name, A small Oblation to Revenge and Fame? The mighty-soul'd Abimelec to shew What for high place a higher Spirit can do, A Hecatomb almost of Brethren slew, And seventy times in nearest blood he dy'd (To make it hold) his Royal Purple Pride. Why do I name the Lordly Creature Man? The weak, the mild, the Coward Woman, can, When to a Crown she cuts her sacred way, All that oppose with Manlike Courage slay. So Athaliah, when she saw her Son, And with his Life her dearer Greatness gone, With a Majestique fury slaughter'd all Whom high birth might to high pretences call. Since he was dead who all her power sustain'd, Resolv'd to reign alone; Resolv'd, and Reign'd. In vain her Sex, in vain the Laws withstood, In vain the sacred plea of David's Blood, A noble, and a bold contention, She, (One Woman) undertook with Destiny. She to pluck down, Destiny to uphold (Oblig'd by holy Oracles of old) The great Jessœan race on Juda's Throne; Till 'twas at last an equal Wager grown, Scarce Fate, with much adoe, the Better got by One. Tell me not she her self at last was slain; Did she not first seven years (a Life-time) reign? Seven royal years t' a publick spirit will seem More than the private Life of a Methusalem. 'Tis Godlike to be Great; and as they say A thousand years to God are but a day: So to a Man, when once a Crown he wears, The Coronation Days more than a thousand years. [When, Lo, e're the last words were fully spoke] When, Lo, e're the last words were fully spoke, From a fair Cloud, which rather ope'd, than broke, A flash of Light rather than Lightning came, So swift, and yet so gentle was the Flame. Upon it rode, and in his full Career, Seem'd to my Eyes no sooner There than Here, The comliest Youth of all th' Angelique Race; Lovely his shape, ineffable his Face. The Frowns with which he strook the trembling Fiend, All smiles of Humane Beauty did transcend, His Beams of Locks fell part dishevel'd down, Part upwards curld, and form'd a nat'ral Crown, Such as the Brittish Monarchs us'd to wear; If Gold might be compar'd with Angels Hair. His Coat and flowing Mantle were so bright, They seem'd both made of woven Silver Light: Across his Breast an azure Ruban went, At which a Medal hung that did present In wondrous living figures to the sight, The mystick Champions, and old Dragon's fight, And from his Mantles side there shone afar, A fixt, and, I believe, a real Star. In his fair hand (what need was there of more?) No Arms but th' English bloody Cross he bore, Which when he towards th' affrighted Tyrant bent, And some few words pronounc'd (but what they meant, Or were, could not, alas, by me be known, Only I well perceiv'd Jesus was one) He trembled, and he roar'd, and fled away; Mad to quit thus his more than hop'd-for prey. Such Rage inflames the Wolves wild heart and eyes (Rob'd as he thinks unjustly of his prize) Whom unawares the Shepherd spies, and draws The bleating Lamb from out his ravenous jaws. The Shepherd fain himself would he assail, But Fear above his Hunger does prevail, He knows his Foe too strong, and must be gone; He grins as he looks back, and howls as he goes on. Several Discourses by way of Essays, in Verse and Prose. 1. Of Liberty. The following verse has been extracted from the prose of this discourse. [Who governs his own course with steddy hand] Who governs his own course with steddy hand, Who does Himself with Sovereign Pow'r command; Whom neither Death, nor Poverty does fright, Who stands not aukwardly in his own light Against the Truth: who can when Pleasures knock Loud at his door, keep firm the bolt and lock. Who can though Honour at his gate should stay In all her Masking Cloaths, send her away, And cry, be gone, I have no mind to Play. [Magne Deus, quod ad has vitœ brevis attinet horas] Magne Deus, quod ad has vitœ brevis attinet horas, Da mihi, da Panem Libertatemque, nec ultrà Sollicitas effundo preces, siquid datur ultrà Accipiam gratus; si non, Contentus abibo. For the few Houres of Life allotted me, Give me (great God) but Bread and Liberty, I'le beg no more; if more thou'rt pleas'd to give, I'le thankfully that Overplus receive: If beyond this no more be freely sent, I'le thank for this, and go away content. Martial. Lib. 2. Vota tui breviter, &amp;c. Well then, Sir, you shall know how far extend The Prayers and Hopes of your Poetick Friend; He does not Palaces nor Manors crave, Would be no Lord, but less a Lord would have. The ground he holds, if he his own, can call, He quarrels not with Heaven because 'tis small: Let gay and toilsome Greatness others please, He loves of homely Littleness the Ease. Can any Man in guilded rooms attend, And his dear houres in humble visits spend; When in the fresh and beauteous Fields he may With various healthful pleasures fill the day? If there be Man (ye Gods) I ought to Hate Dependance and Attendance be his Fate. Still let him Busie be, and in a crowd, And very much a Slave, and very Proud: Thus he perhaps Pow'rful and Rich may grow; No matter, O ye Gods! that I'le allow. But let him Peace and Freedome never see; Let him not love this Life, who loves not Me. Martial. L. [2.] Vis fieri Liber? &amp;c. Would you be Free? 'Tis your chief wish, you say, Come on; I'le shew thee, Friend, the certain way, If to no Feasts abroad thou lov'st to go, Whilst bounteous God does Bread at home bestow, If thou the goodness of thy Cloaths dost prize By thine own Use, and not by others Eyes. (If onely safe from Weathers) thou can'st dwell, I[n] a small House, but a convenient Shell, If thou without a Sigh, or Golden wish, Canst look upon thy Beechen Bowl, and Dish; If in thy Mind such power and greatness be, The Persian King's a Slave compar'd with Thee. Mart. L. 2. Quod te nomine? &amp;c. That I do you with humble Bowes no more, And danger of my naked Head adore. That I who Lord and Master cry'd erewhile, Salute you in a new and different Stile, By your own Name, a scandal to you now, Think not that I forget my self or you: By loss of all things by all others sought This Freedome, and the Freemans Hat is bought. A Lord and Master no man wants but He Who o're Himself has no Autoritie. Who does for Honours and for Riches strive, And Follies, without which Lords cannot Live. If thou from Fortune dost no Servant crave, Believe it, thou no Master need'st to have. Ode. Upon Liberty. 1. Freedome with Virtue takes her seat, Her proper place, her onely Scene, Is in the Golden Mean, She lives not with the Poor, nor with the Great. The Wings of those Necessity has clipt, And they'r in Fortunes Bridewell whipt, To the laborious task of Bread; These are by various Tyrants Captive lead. Now wild Ambition with imperious force Rides, raines, and spurs them like th' unruly Horse. And servile Avarice yoakes them now Like toilsome Oxen to the Plow. And sometimes Lust, like the Misguiding Light, Drawes them through all the Labyrinths of Night. If any Few among the Great there be From these insulting Passions free, Yet we ev'n those too fetter'd see By Custom, Business, Crowds, and formal Decency. And whereso'ere they stay, and whereso'ere they go, Impertinencies round them flow: These are the small uneasie things Which about Greatness still are found, And rather it Molest then Wound: Like Gnats which too much heat of summer brings; But Cares do swarm there too, and those have stings: As when the Honey does too open lie, A thousand Wasps about it fly: Nor will the Master ev'n to share admit; The Master stands aloof, and dares not Tast of it. 2. 'Tis Morning; well; I fain would yet sleep on; You cannot now; you must be gone To Court, or to the noisy Hall: Besides, the Rooms without are crowded all; The st[r]eam of Business does begin, And a Spring-Tide of Clients is come in. Ah cruel Guards, which this poor Prisoner keep! Will they not suffer him to sleep? Make an Escape; out at the Postern flee, And get some blessed Houres of Libertie, With a few Friends, and a few Dishes dine, And much of Mirth and moderate Wine. To thy bent Mind some relaxation give, And steal one day out of thy Life to Live. Oh happy man (he cries) to whom kind Heaven Has such a Freedome alwayes given! Why, mighty Madman, what should hinder thee From being every day as Free? 3. In all the Freeborn Nations of the Air, Never did Bird a spirit so mean and sordid bear, As to exchange his Native Liberty Of soaring boldly up into the sky, His Liberty to Sing, to Perch, or Fly, When, and where'ver he thought good, And all his innocent pleasures of the Wood, For a more plentiful or constant Food. Nor ever did Ambitious rage Make him into a painted Cage; Or the false Forest of a well-hung Room, For Honour and Preferment come. Now, Blessings on ye all, ye Heroick Race, Who keep their Primitive powers and rights so well Though Men and Angels fell. Of all Material Lives the highest place, To you is justly given; And wayes and walkes the neerest Heaven. Whilst wretched we, yet vain and proud, think fit To boast, That we look up to it. Even to the Universal Tyrant Love, You Homage pay but once a year: None so degenerous and unbirdly prove, As his perpetual yoke to bear. None but a few unhappy Houshold Foul, Whom human Lordship does controul; Who from their birth corrupted were By Bondage, and by mans Example here. He's no small Prince who every day Thus to himself can say, Now will I sleep, now eat, now sit, now walk, Now meditate alone, now with Acquaintance talk. This I will do, here I will stay, Or if my Fancy call me away, My Man and I will presently go ride; (For we before have nothing to provide, Nor after are to render an account) To Dover, Barwick, or the Cornish Mount. If thou but a short journey take, As if thy last thou wert to make, Business must be dispatch'd e're thou canst part, Nor canst thou stirr unless there be A hundred Horse and Men to wait on thee, And many a Mule, and many a Cart; What an [unwieldy] man thou art? The Rhodian Colossus so A Journey too might go. 5 Where Honour or where Conscience does not bind No other Law shall shackle me, Slave to my self I will not be, Nor shall my future Actions be confin'd By my own present Mind. Who by Resolves and Vows engag'd does stand For days that yet belong to Fate, Does like an unthrift Mor[t]gage his Estate Before it falls into his Hand, The Bondman of the Cloister so All that he does receive does always owe. And still as Time comes in, it goes away Not to Enjoy, but Debts to pay. Unhappy Slave, and Pupil to a Bell! Which his hours work as well as hours does tell! Unhappy till the last, the kind releasing Knell. 6. If Life should a well-order'd Poem be (In which he only hits the white Who joyns true Profit with the best Delight) The more Heroique strain let others take, Mine the Pindarique way I'le make. The Matter shall be Grave, the Numbers loose and free. It shall not keep one setled pace of Time, In the same Tune it shall not always Chime, Nor shall each day just to his Neighbour Rhime, A thousand Liberties it shall dispense, And yet shall mannage all without offence; Or to the sweetness of the Sound, or greatness of the Sence, Nor shall it never from one Subject start, Nor seek Transitions to depart, Nor its set way o're Stiles and Bridges make, Nor thorough Lanes a Compass take As if it fear'd some trespass to commit, When the wide Air's a Road for it. So the Imperial Eagle does not stay Till the whole Carkass he devour That's fallen into its power. As if his generous Hunger understood That he can never want plenty of Food, He only sucks the tastful Blood. And to fresh Game flies cheerfully away; To Kites and meaner Birds he leaves the mangled Prey. [2.] Of Solitude. The following verse has bean extracted from the prose of this discourse. [Hail, old Patrician Trees, so great and good!] 1 Hail, old Patrician Trees, so great and good! Hail ye Plebeian under wood! Where the Poetique Birds rejoyce, And for their quiet Nests and plentious Food, Pay with their grateful voice. 2 Hail, the poor Muses richest Mannor Seat! Ye Countrey Houses and Retreat, Which all the happy Gods so Love, That for you oft they quit their Bright and Great Metropolis above. 3 Here Nature does a House for me erect, Nature the wisest Architect, Who those fond Artists does despise That can the fair and living Trees neglect; Yet the Dead Timber prize. 4 Here let me careless and unthoughtful lying, Hear the soft winds above me flying, With all their wanton Boughs dispute, And the more tuneful Birds to both replying Nor be my self too Mute. 5 A Silver stream shall roul his waters neer, Guilt with the Sun-beams here and there On whose enamel'd Bank I'll walk, And see how prettily they Smile, and hear How prettily they Talk. 6 Ah wretched, and too Solitary Hee Who loves not his own Company! He'l feel the weight of't many a day Unless he call in Sin or Vanity To help to bear't away. 7 Oh Solitude, first state of Human-kind! Which blest remain'd till man did find Even his own helpers Company. As soon as two (alas!) together joyn'd, The Serpent made up Three. 8 Though God himself, through countless Ages Thee His sole Companion chose to be, Thee, Sacred Solitude alone, Before the Branchy head of Numbers Tree Sprang from the Trunk of One. 9 Thou (though men think thine an unactive part) Dost break and tame th'unruly heart, Which else would know no setled pace, Making it move, well mannag'd by thy Art, With Swiftness and with Grace. 10 Thou the faint beams of Reasons scatter'd Light, Dost like a Burning-glass unite, Dost multiply the feeble Heat, And fortifie the strength, till thou dost bright And noble Fires beget. 11 Whilst this hard Truth I teach, methinks, I see The Monster London laugh at me, I should at thee too, foolish City, If it were fit to laugh at Misery, But thy Estate I pity. 12 Let but thy wicked men from out thee go, And all the Fools that crowd the[e] so, Even thou who dost thy Millions boast, A Village less then Islington wilt grow, A Solitude almost. 3. Of Obscurity. The following verse has been extracted from the prose of this discourse. Seneca, ex Thyeste, Act. 2. Chor. Stet quicunque volet, potens Aulæ culmine lubrico, &amp;c. Upon the slippery tops of humane State, The guilded Pinnacles of Fate, Let others proudly stand, and for a while The giddy danger to beguile, With Joy, and with disdain look down on all, Till their Heads turn, and down they, fall. Me, O ye Gods, on Earth, or else so near That I no Fall to Earth may fear, And, O ye gods, at a good distance seat From the long Ruines of the Great. Here wrapt in th' Arms of Quiet let me ly; Quiet, Companion of Obscurity. Here let my Life, with as much silence slide, As Time that measures it does glide. Nor let the Breath of Infamy or Fame, From town to town Eccho about my Name. Nor let my homely Death embroidered be With Scutcheon or with Elegie. An old Plebean let me Dy, Alas, all then are such as well as I. To him, alas, to him, I fear, The face of Death will terrible appear: Who in his life flattering his senceless pride By being known to all the world beside, Does not himself, when he is Dying know Nor what he is, nor Whither hee's to go. 4. Of Agriculture. The following verse has been extracted from the prose of this discourse. Virg. Georg. O fortunatus nimium, &amp;c. A Translation out of Virgil. Oh happy, (if his Happiness he knows) The Country Swain, on whom kind Heav'n bestows At home all Riches that wise Nature needs; Whom the just earth with easie plenty feeds. 'Tis true, no morning Tide of Clients comes, And fills the painted Chanels of his rooms, Adoring the rich Figures, as they pass, In Tap'stry wrought, or cut in living brass; Nor is his Wooll superfluously dy'd With the dear Poyson of Assyrian pride: Nor do Arabian Perfumes vainly spoil The Native Use, and Sweetness of his Oyl. Instead of these, his calm and harmless life Free from th' Alarms of Fear, and storms of Strife, Does with substantial blessedness abound, And the soft wings of Peace cover him round: Through artless Grots the murmuring waters glide; Thick Trees both against Heat and Cold provide, From whence the Birds salute him; and his ground With lowing Herds, and bleeting Sheep does sound; And all the Rivers, and the Forests nigh, Both Food and Game, and Exercise supply. Here a well hard'ned active youth we see, Taught the great Art of chearful Poverty. Here, in this place alone, there still do shine Some streaks of Love, both humane and Divine; From hence Astræa took her flight, and here Still her last Foot-steps upon Earth appear. 'Tis true, the first desire which does controul All the inferiour wheels that move my Soul, Is, that the Muse me her high Priest would make; Into her holyest Scenes of Myst'ry take, And open there to my mind's purged eye Those wonders which to Sense the Gods deny; How in the Moon such change of shapes is found: The Moon, the changing Worlds eternal bound. What shakes the solid Earth, what strong disease Dares trouble the firm Centre's antient ease; What makes the Sea retreat, and what advance: Varieties too regular for chance. What drives the Chariot on of Winters light, And stops the lazy Waggon of the night. But if my dull and frozen Blood deny, To send forth Sp'rits that raise a Soul so high; In the next place, let Woods and Rivers be My quiet, though unglorious destiny. In Life's cool vale let my low Scene be laid; Cover me Gods, with Tempe's thickest shade. Happy the Man, I grant, thrice happy he Who can through gross effects their causes see: Whose courage from the deeps of knowledg springs, Nor vainly fears inevitable things; But does his walk of virtue calmly go, Through all th' allarms of Death and Hell below. Happy! but next such Conquerours, happy they, Whose humble Life lies not in fortunes way. They unconcern'd from their safe distant seat, Behold the Rods and Scepters of the great. The quarrels of the mighty without fear, And the descent of forein Troops they hear. Nor can even Rome their steddy course misguide, With all the lustre of her perishing Pride. Them never yet did strife or avarice draw, Into the noisy markets of the Law, The Camps of Gowned War, nor do they live By rules or forms that many mad men give. Duty for Natures Bounty they repay, And her sole Laws religiously obey. Some with bold Labour plow the faithless main, Some rougher storms in Princes Courts sustain. Some swell up their sleight sails with pop'ular fame, Charm'd with the foolish whistlings of a Name. Some their vain wealth to Earth again commit; With endless cares some brooding o're it sit. Country and Friends are by some Wretches sold, To lie on Tyrian Beds and drink in Gold; No price too high for profit can be shown; Not Brothers blood, nor hazards of their own. Around the World in search of it they roam, It makes ev'n their Antipodes their home; Mean while, the prudent Husbandman is found, In mutual duties striving with his ground, And half the year he care of that does take, That half the year grateful returns does make. Each fertil moneth does some new gifts present, And with new work his industry content. This, the young Lamb, that the soft Fleece doth yield, This, loads with Hay, and that, with Corn the Field: All sorts of Fruit crown the rich Autumns Pride: And on a swelling Hill's warm stony side, The powerful Princely Purple of the Vine, Twice dy'd with the redoubled Sun, does shine. In th' Evening to a fair ensuing day, With joy he sees his Flocks and Kids to play; And loaded Kyne about his Cottage stand, Inviting with known sound the Milkers hand; And when from wholsom labour he doth come, With wishes to be there, and wish't for home, He meets at door the softest humane blisses, His chast Wives welcom, and dear Childrens kisses. When any Rural Holy dayes invite His Genius forth to innocent delight, On Earth's fair bed beneath some sacred shade, Amidst his equal friends carelesly laid, He sings thee Bacchus Patron of the Vine, The Beechen Boul fomes with a floud of Wine, Not to the loss of reason or of strength: To active games and manly sport at length, Their mirth ascends, and with fill'd veins they see, Who can the best at better trials be. Such was the Life the prudent Sabins chose, From such the old Hetrurian virtue rose. Such, Remus and the God his Brother led, From such firm footing Rome grew the World's head. Such was the Life that ev'n till now does raise The honour of poor Saturns golden dayes: Before Men born of Earth and buried there, Let in the Sea their mortal fate to share. Before new wayes of perishing were sought, Before unskilful Death on Anvils wrought. Before those Beasts which humane Life sustain, By Men, unless to the Gods use were slain. Horat. Epodon. Beatus ille qui procul, &amp;c. Happy the Man whom bounteous Gods allow With his own Hands Paternal Grounds to plough! Like the first golden Mortals Happy he From Business and the cares of Money free! No humane storms break off at Land his sleep. No loud Alarms of Nature on the Deep, From all the cheats of Law he lives secure, Nor does th' affronts of Palaces endure; Sometimes the beauteous Marriagable Vine He to the lusty Bridegroom Elm does joyn; Sometimes he lops the barren Trees around, And grafts new Life into the fruitful wound; Sometimes he sheers his Flock, and sometimes he Stores up the Golden Treasures of the Bee. He sees his lowing Herds walk o're the Plain, Whilst neighbouring Hills low back to them again: And when the Season Rich as well as Gay, All her Autumnal Bounty does display. How is he pleas'd th' encreasing Use to see, Of his well trusted Labours bend the tree? Of which large shares, on the glad sacred daies He gives to Friends, and to the Gods repays. With how much joy do's he beneath some shade By aged trees rev'rend embraces made, His careless head on the fresh Green recline, His head uncharg'd with Fear or with Design. By him a River constantly complaines, The Birds above rejoyce with various strains And in the solemn Scene their Orgies keep Like Dreams mixt with the Gravity of sleep, Sleep which does alwaies there for entrance wait And nought within against it shuts the gate. Nor does the roughest season of the sky, Or sullen Jove all sports to him deny, He runs the Mazes of the nimble Hare, His well-mouth'd Dogs glad concert rends the air, Or with game bolder, and rewarded more, He drives into a Toil, the foaming Bore, Here flies the Hawk t' assault, and there the Net To intercept the travailing foul is set. And all his malice, all his craft is shown In innocent wars, on beasts and birds alone. This is the life from all misfortunes free, From thee the Great one, Tyrant Love, from Thee; And if a chaste and clean, though homely wife Be added to the blessings of this Life, Such as the antient Sun-burnt Sabins were, Such as Apulia, frugal still, does bear, Who makes her Children and the house her care, And joyfully the work of Life does share, Nor thinks herself too noble or too fine To pin the sheepfold or to milch the Kine, Who waits at door against her Husband come From rural duties, late, and wearied home, Where she receives him with a kind embrace, A chearful Fire, and a more chearful Face: And fills the Boul up to her homely Lord, And with domestique plenty loads the board. Not all the lustful shel-fish of the Sea, Drest by the wanton hand of Luxurie, Nor Ortalans nor Godwits nor the rest Of costly names that glorify a Feast, Are at the Princely tables better cheer, Then Lamb and Kid, Lettice and Olives here. The Country Mouse. A Paraphrase upon Horace 2 Book, Satyr. 6. At the large foot of a fair hollow tree, Close to plow'd ground, seated commodiously, His antient and Hereditary House, There dwelt a good substantial Country-Mouse: Frugal, and grave, and careful of the main, Yet, one, who once did nobly entertain A City Mouse well coated, sleek, and gay, A Mouse of high degree, which lost his way, Wantonly walking forth to take the Air, And arriv'd early, and belighted there, For a days lodging: the good hearty Hoast, (The antient plenty of his hall to boast) Did all the stores produce, that might excite, With various tasts, the Courtiers appetite. Fitches and Beans, Peason, and Oats, and Wheat, And a large Chesnut, the delicious meat Which Jove himself, were he a Mouse, would eat. And for a Haut goust there was mixt with these The swerd of Bacon, and the coat of Cheese. The precious Reliques, which at Harvest, he Had gather'd from the Reapers luxurie. Freely (said he) fall on and never spare, The bounteous Gods will for to morrow care. And thus at ease on beds of straw they lay, And to their Genius sacrific'd the day. Yet the nice guest's Epicurean mind, (Though breeding made him civil seem and kind) Despis'd this Country feast, and still his thought Upon the Cakes and Pies of London wrought. Your bounty and civility (said he) Which I'm surpriz'd in these rude parts to see, Shews that the Gods have given you a mind, Too noble for the fate which here you find. Why should a Soul, so virtuous and so great, Lose it self thus in an Obscure retreat? Let savage Beasts lodg in a Country Den, You should see Towns, and Manners know, and men: And taste the generous Lux'ury of the Court, Where all the Mice of quality resort; Where thousand beauteous shees about you move, And by high fare, are plyant made to love. We all e're long must render up our breath, No cave or hole can shelter us from death. Since Life is so uncertain, and so short, Let's spend it all in feasting and in sport. Come, worthy Sir, come with me, and partake, All the great things that mortals happy make. Alas, what virtue hath sufficient Arms, T'oppose bright Honour, and soft Pleasures charms? What wisdom can their magick force repel? It draws this reverend Hermit from his Cel. It was the time, when witty Poets tell, That Phœbus into Thetis bosom fell: She blusht at first, and then put out the light, And drew the modest Curtains of the night. Plainly, the troth to tell, the Sun was set, When to the Town our wearied Travellers get, To a Lords house, as Lordly as can be Made for the use of Pride and Luxury, They come; the gentle Courtier at the door Stops and will hardly enter in before. But 'tis, Sir, your command, and being so, I'm sworn t' obedience, and so in they go. Behind a hanging in a spacious room, (The richest work of Mortclakes noble Loom) They wait awhile their wearied limbs to rest, Till silence should invite them to their feast. About the hour that Cynthia's Silver light, Had touch'd the pale Meridies of the night; At last the various Supper being done, It happened that the Company was gone, Into a room remote, Servants and all, To please their nobles fancies with a Ball. Our host leads forth his stranger, and do's find, All fitted to the bounties of his mind. Still on the Table half fill'd dishes stood, And with delicious bits the floor was strow'd. The courteous mouse presents him with the best, And both with fat varieties are blest, Th' industrious Peasant every where does range, And thanks the gods for his Life's happy change. Loe, in the midst of a well fraited Pye, They both at last glutted and wanton lye. When see the sad Reverse of prosperous fate, And what fierce storms on mortal glories wait. With hideous noise, down the rude servants come, Six dogs before run barking into th' room; The wretched gluttons fly with wild affright, And hate the fulness which retards their flight. Our trembling Peasant wishes now in vain, That Rocks and Mountains cover'd him again. Oh how the change of his poor life he curst! This, of all lives (said he) is sure the worst. Give me again, ye gods, my Cave and wood; With peace, let tares and acorns be my food. A Paraphrase upon the 10th Epistle of the first Book of Horace. Horace to Fuscus Aristius. Health, from the lover of the Country me, Health, to the lover of the City thee, A difference in our souls, this only proves, In all things else, w' agree like marryed doves. But the warm nest, and crowded dove-house thou Dost like; I loosly fly from bough to bough, And Rivers drink, and all the shining day, Upon fair Trees, or mossy Rocks I play; In fine, I live and reign when I retire From all that you equal with Heaven admire. Like one at last from the Priests service fled, Loathing the honie'd Cakes, I long for Bread. Would I a house for happines erect, Nature alone should be the Architect. She'd build it more convenient, then great, And doubtless in the Country choose her seat. Is there a place, doth better helps supply, Against the wounds of Winters cruelty? Is there an Ayr that gentl'er does asswage The mad Celestial Dogs, or Lyons rage? Is it not there that sleep (and only there) Nor noise without, nor cares within does fear? Does art through pipes, a purer water bring, Then that which nature straines into a spring? Can all your Tap'stries, or your Pictures show More beauties then in herbs and flowers do grow? Fountains and trees our wearied Pride do please, Even in the midst of gilded Palaces. And in your towns that prospect gives delight, Which opens round the country to our sight. Men to the good, from which they rashly fly, Return at last, and their wild Luxury Does but in vain with those true joyes contend, Which Nature did to mankind recommend. The man who changes gold for burnisht Brass, Or small right Gems, for larger ones of glass: Is not, at length, more certain to be made Ridiculous, and wretched by the trade, Than he, who sells a solid good, to buy The painted goods of Pride and Vanity. If thou be wise, no glorious fortune choose, Which 'tis but pain to keep, yet grief to loose. For, when we place even trifles, in the heart, With trifles too, unwillingly we part. An humble Roof, plain bed, and homely board, More clear, untainted pleasures do afford, Then all the Tumult of vain greatness brings To Kings, or to the favorites of Kings. The horned Deer by Nature arm'd so well, Did with the Horse in common pasture dwell; And when they fought, the field it alwayes wan, Till the ambitious Horse begg'd help of Man, And took the bridle, and thenceforth did reign Bravely alone, as Lord of all the plain: But never after could the Rider get From off his back, or from his mouth the bit. So they, who poverty too much do fear, T' avoid that weight, a greater burden bear; That they might Pow'r above their equals have, To cruel Masters they themselves enslave. For Gold, their Liberty exchang'd we see, That fairest flow'r, which crowns Humanity. And all this mischief does upon them light, Only, because they know not how, aright, That great, but secret, happiness to prize, That's laid up in a Little, for the Wise: That is the best, and easiest Estate, Which to a man sits close, but not too strait; 'Tis like a shooe; it pinches, and it burns, Too narrow; and too large it overturns. My dearest friend, stop thy desires at last, And chearfully enjoy the wealth thou hast. And, if me still seeking for more you see, Chide, and reproach, despise and laugh at me. Money was made, not to command our will, But all our lawful pleasures to fulfil. Shame and wo to us, if we' our wealth obey; The Horse doth with the Horse-man run away. The Country Life. Libr. 4. Plantarum. Blest be the man (and blest he is) whom [e're] (Plac'd far out of the roads of Hope or Fear) A little Field, and little Garden feeds; The Field gives all that Frugal Nature needs, The wealthy Garden liberally bestows All she can ask, when she luxurious grows. The specious inconveniences that wait Upon a life of Business, and of State, He sees (nor does the sight disturb his rest) By Fools described, by wicked men possest. Thus, thus (and this deserv'd great Virgils praise) The old Corycian Yeom[a]n past his daies, Thus his wise life Abdolonymus spent: Th' Ambassadours which the great Emp'rour sent To offer him a Crown, with wonder found The reverend Gard'ner howing of his Ground, Unwillingly and slow and discontent, From his lov'd Cottage, to a Throne he went? And oft he stopt in his tryumphant way, And oft lookt back, and oft was heard to say Not without sighs, Alas, I there forsake A happier Kingdom then I go to take. Thus Aglaüs (a man unknown to men, But the gods knew and therefore lov'd him Then) Thus liv'd obscurely then without a Name, Aglaüs now consign'd t' eternal Fame. For Gyges, the rich King, wicked and great, Presum'd at wise Apollos Delphick seat Presum'd to ask, Oh thou, the whole Worlds Eye, See'st thou a Man, that Happier is then I? The God, who scorn'd to flatter Man, reply'd, Aglaüs Happier is. But Gyges cry'd, In a proud rage, Who can that Aglaüs be? We have heard as yet of no such King as Hee. And true it was through the whole Earth around No King of such a Name was to be found. Is some old Hero of that name alive, Who his high race does from the Gods derive? Is it some mighty General that has done, Wonders in fight, and God-like honours wone? Is it some m[a]n of endless wealth, said he? None, none of these; who can this Aglaüs bee? After long search and vain inquiries past, In an obscure Arcadian Vale at last, (The Arcadian life has always shady been. Near Sopho's Town (which he but once had seen) This Aglaüs who Monarchs Envy drew, Whose Happiness the Gods stood witness too, This mighty Aglaüs was labouring found, With his own Hands in his own little ground. So, gracious God, (if it may lawful be, Among those foolish gods to mention Thee) So let me act, on such a private stage, The last dull Scenes of my declining Age; After long toiles and Voyages in vain, This quiet Port let my tost Vessel gain, Of Heavenly rest, this Earnest to me lend, Let my Life sleep, and learn to love her End. The Garden. To J. Evelyn Esquire. 1. Happy art Thou, whom God does bless With the full choice of thine own Happiness; And happier yet, because thou'rt blest With prudence, how to choose the best: In Books and Gardens thou hast plac'd aright (Things which thou well dost understand; And both dost make with thy laborious hand) Thy noble, innocent delight: And in thy virtuous Wife, where thou again dost meet Both pleasures more refin'd and sweet: The fairest Garden in her Looks, And in her Mind the wisest Books. Oh, Who would change these soft, yet solid joys, For empty shows and senceless noys; And all which rank Ambition breeds, Which seem such beauteous Flowers, and are such poisonous Weeds? 2. When God did Man to his own Likeness make, As much as Clay, though of the purest kind, By the great Potters art refin'd; Could the Divine Impression take, He thought it fit to place him, where A kind of Heaven too did appear, As far as Earth could such a Likeness bear: That man no happiness might want, Which Earth to her first Master could afford; He did a Garden for him plant By the quick Hand of his Omnipotent Word. As the chief Help and Joy of human life, He gave him the first Gift; first, ev'n before a Wife. 3. For God, the universal Architect, 'Thad been as easie to erect A Louvre or Escurial, or a Tower That might with Heav'n communication hold, As Babel vainly thought to do of old: He wanted not the skill or power, In the Worlds Fabrick those were shown, And the Materials were all his own. But well he knew what place would best agree With Innocence, and with Felicity: And we elsewhere still seek for them in vain, If any part of either yet remain; If any part of either we expect, This may our Judgment in the search direct; God the first Garden made, and the first City, Cain. 4. Oh blessed shades! O gentle cool retreat From all th' immoderate Heat, In which the frantick World does Burn and Sweat! This does the Lion-Star, Ambitions rage; This Avarice, the Dogstars Thirst asswage; Every where else their fatal power we see, They make and rule Mans wretched Destiny: They neither Set, nor Disappear, But tyrannize o're all the Year; Whilst we ne're feel their Flame or Influence here. The Birds that dance from Bough to Bough, And Sing above in every Tree, Are not from Fears and Cares more free, Then we who Lie, or Sit, or Walk below, And should by right be Singers too. What Princes Quire of Musick can excell That which within this shade does dwell? To which we nothing Pay or Give, They like all other Poets live, Without reward, or thanks for their obliging pains; 'Tis well if they become not Prey: The whis[t]ling Winds add their less artfull strains, And a grave Base the murmuring Fountains play; Nature does all this Harmony bestow, But to our Plants, Arts Musick too, The Pipe, Theorbo, and Guitarr we owe; The Lute it self, which once was Green and Mute, When Orpheus strook th' inspired Lute, The Trees danc'd round, and understood By Sympathy the Voice of Wood. 5. These are the Spels that to kind Sleep invite, And nothing does within resistance make, Which yet we moderately take; Who would not choose to be awake, While he's encompast round with such delight, To th' Ear, the Nose, the Touch, the Tast &amp; Sight? When Venus would her dear Ascanius keep A Prisoner in the Downy Bands of Sleep, She Od'rous Herbs and Flowers beneath him spread As the most soft and sweetest Bed; Not her own Lap would more have charm'd his Head. Who, that has Reason, and his Smell, Would not among Roses and Jasmin dwell, Rather then all his Spirits choak With Exhalations of Durt and Smoak? And all th' uncleanness which does drown In Pestilential Clouds a populous Town? The Earth it self breaths better Perfumes here, Then all the Femal Men or Women there, Not without cause, about them bear. 6. When Epicurus to the World had taught, That Pleasure was the chiefest Good, (And was perhaps i'th' right, if rightly understood) His Life he to his Doctrine brought, And in a Gardens shade that Sovereign Pleasure sought: Whoever a true Epicure would be, May there find cheap and virtuous Luxurie. Vitellius his Table, which did hold As many Creatures as the Ark of old: That Fiscal Table, to which every day All Countries did a constant Tribute pay, Could nothing more delicious afford, Then Natures Liberalitie, Helpt with a little Art and Industry, Allows the meanest Gard'ners board. The wanton Tast no Fish, or Fowl can choose, For which the Grape or Melon she would lose, Though all th' Inhabitants of Sea and Air Be listed in the Gluttons bill of Fare; Yet still the Fruits of Earth we see Plac'd the Third Story high in all her Luxury. 7. But with no Sence the Garden does comply; None courts, or flatters, as it does the Eye: When the great Hebrew King did almost strain The wond'rous Treasures of his Wealth and Brain, His Royal Southern Guest to entertain; Though she on Silver Floores did tread, With bright Assyrian Carpets on them spread, To hide the Metals Poverty. Though she look'd up to Roofs of Gold, And nought around her could behold But Silk and rich Embrodery, And Babylonian Tapestry, And wealthy Hirams Princely Dy: Though Ophirs Starry Stones met every where her Eye; Though She her self, and her gay Host were drest With all the shining glories of the East; When lavish Art her costly work had done, The honour and the Prize of Bravery Was by the Garden from the Palace won; And every Rose and Lilly there did stand Better attir'd by Natures hand: The case thus judg'd against the King we see, By one that would not be so Rich, though Wiser far then He. 8. Nor does this happy place onely dispence Such various Pleasures to the Sence; Here Health it self does live, That Salt of Life, which does to all a relish give, Its standing Pleasure, and Intrinsick Wealth, The Bodies Virtue, and the Souls good Fortune Health. The Tree of Life, when it in Eden stood, Did its immortal Head to Heaven rear; It lasted a tall Cedar till the Flood; Now a small thorny Shrub it does appear; Nor will it thrive too every where: It alwayes here is freshest seen; 'Tis onely here an Ever-green. If through the strong and beauteous Fence Of Temperance and Innocence, And wholsome Labours, and a quiet Mind, Any Diseases passage find, They must not think here to assail A Land unarm'd, or without a Guard; They must fight for it, and dispute it hard, Before they can prevail: Scarce any Plant is growing here Which against Death some Weapon does not bear. Let Cities boast, That they provide For Life the Ornaments of Pride; But 'tis the Country and the Field, That furnish it with Staffe and Shield. 9. Where does the Wisdom and the Power Divine In a more bright and sweet Reflection shine? Where do we finer strokes and colours see Of the Creators Real Poetry, Then when we with attention look Upon the Third Dayes Volume of the Book? If we could open and intend our Eye, We all like Moses should espy Ev'n in a Bush the radiant Deitie. But we despise these his Inferiour wayes, (Though no less full of Miracle and Praise) Upon the Flowers of Heaven we gaze; The Stars of Earth no wonder in us raise, Though these perhaps do more then they, The life of Mankind sway. Although no part of mighty Nature be More stor'd with Beauty, Power, and Mysterie; Yet to encourage human Industrie, God has so ordered, that no other part Such Space, and such Dominion leaves for Art. 10. We no where Art do so triumphant see, As when it Grafs or Buds the Tree: In other things we count it to excell, If it a Docile Schollar can appear To Nature, and but imitate her well; It over-rules, and is her Master here. It imitates her Makers Power Divine, And changes her sometimes, and sometimes does refine: It does, like Grace, the Fallen Tree restore To its blest state of Paradise before: Who would not joy to see his conquering hand Ore all the Vegetable World command? And the wild Giants of the Wood receive What Law he's pleas'd to give? He bids th' il-natur'd Crab produce The gentler Apples Winy Juice; The golden fruit that worthy is Of Galatea's purple kiss; He does the savage Hawthorn teach To bear the Medlar and the Pear, He bids the rustick Plum to rear A noble Trunk, and be a Peach. Even Daphnes coyness he does mock, And weds the Cherry to her stock, Though she refus'd Apolloes suit; Even she, that chast and Virgin Tree, Now wonders at her self, to see That she's a mother made, and blushes in her fruit. 11. Methinks I see great Dioclesian walk In the Salonian Gardens noble shade, Which by his own Imperial hands was made: I see him smile (methinks) as he does talk With the Ambassadors, who come in vain, T' entice him to a throne again. If I, my Friends (said he) should to you show All the delights, which in these Gardens grow; 'Tis likelier much, that you should with me stay, Than 'tis that you should carry me away: And trust me not, my Friends, if every day, I walk not here with more delight, Then ever after the most happy fight, In Triumph, to the Capitol, I rod, To thank the gods, &amp; to be thought, my self almost a god. 6. Of Greatness. The following verse has been extracted from the prose of this discourse. Horace. L. 3. Ode 1. Odi profanum vulgus, &amp;c. 1. Hence, ye Profane; I hate ye all; Both the Great, Vulgar, and the small. To Virgin Minds, which yet their Native whiteness hold, Not yet Discolour'd with the Love of Gold, (That Jaundice of the Soul, Which makes it look so Guilded and so Foul) To you, ye very Few, these truths I tell; The Muse inspires my Song, Heark, and observe it well. 2. We look on Men, and wonder at such odds 'Twixt things that were the same by Birth; We look on Kings as Giants of the Earth, These Giants are but Pigmeys to the Gods. The humblest Bush and proudest Oak, Are but of equal proof against the Thunder-stroke. Beauty, and Strength, and Wit, and Wealth, and Power Have their short flourishing hour; And love to see themselves, and smile, And joy in their Preeminence a while; Even so in the same Land, Poor Weeds, rich Corn, gay Flowers together stand; Alas, Death Mowes down all with an impartial Hand. 3. And all you Men, whom Greatness does so please, Ye feast (I fear) like Damocles: If you your eyes could upwards move, (But you (I fear) think nothing is above) You would perceive by what a little thread The Sword still hangs over your head. No Title of Wine would drown your cares; No Mirth or Musick over-noise your feares. The fear of Death would you so watchfull keep, As not t' admit the Image of it, sleep. 4. Sleep is a God too proud to wait in Palaces And yet so humble too as not to scorn The meanest Country Cottages; His Poppey grows among the Corn. The Halcyon sleep will never build his nest In any stormy breast. 'Tis not enough that he does find Clouds and Darkness in their Mind; Darkness but half his work will do. 'Tis not enough; he must find Quiet too. 5. The man, who in all wishes he does make, Does onely Natures Counsel take. That wise and happy man will never fear The evil Aspects of the Year; Nor tremble, though two Comets should appear; He does not look in Almanacks to see, Whether he Fortunate shall be; Let Mars and Saturn in th' Heavens conjoyn, And what they please against the World design, So Jupiter within him shine. 6. If of your pleasures and desires no end be found, God to your Cares and Fears will set no bound. What would content you? Who can tell? Ye fear so much to lose what you have got, As if you lik'd it well. Ye strive for more, as if ye lik'd it not. Go, level Hills, and fill up Seas, Spare nought that may your wanton Fancy please But trust Me, when you 'have done all this, Much will be Missing still, and much will be Amiss. 7. Of Avarice. The following verse has been extracted from the prose of this discourse. [I'dmire, Mecænas, how it comes to pass] I'dmire, Mecænas, how it comes to pass, That no man ever yet contented was, Nor is, nor perhaps will be with that state In which his own choice plants him or his Fate Happy their Merchant, the old Soldier cries; The Merchant beaten with tempestuous skies, Happy the Soldier one half hour to thee Gives speedy Death or Glorious victory. The Lawyer, knockt up early from his rest By restless Clyents, calls the Peasant blest, The Peasant when his Labours ill succeed, Envys the Mouth which only Talk does feed, 'Tis not (I think you'l say) that I want store Of Instances, if here I add no more, They are enough to reach at least a mile Beyond long Orator Fabias his Stile, But, hold, you whom no Fortune e're endears Gentlemen, Malecontents, and Mutineers, Who bounteous Jove so often cruel call, Behold, Jove's now resolv'd to please you all. Thou Souldier be a Merchant, Merchant, Thou A Souldier be; and, Lawyer, to the Plow. Change all their stations strait, why do they stay? The Devil a man will change, now when he may, Were I in General Jove's abused case, By Jove I'de cudgel this rebellious race: But he's too good; Be all then as you were, However make the best of what you are, And in that state be chearful and rejoyce, Which either was your Fate, or was your Choice. No, they must labour yet, and sweat and toil, And very miserable be a while. But 'tis with a Design only to gain What may their Age with plenteous ease maintain. The prudent Pismire does this Lesson teach And industry to Lazy Mankind preach. The little Drudge does trot about and sweat, Nor does he strait devour all he can get, But in his temperate Mouth carries it home A stock for Winter which he knows must come. And when the rowling World to Creatures here Turns up the deform'd wrong side of the Year, And shuts him in, with storms, and cold, and wet, He chearfully does his past labours eat: O, does he so? your wise example, th' Ant, Does not at all times Rest, and Plenty want. But weighing justly 'a mortal Ants condition Divides his Life 'twixt Labour and Fruition. Thee neither heat, nor storms, nor wet, nor cold From thy unnatural diligence can withhold, To th' Indies thou wouldst run rather then see Another, though a Friend, Richer then Thee. Fond man! what Good or Beauty can be found In heaps of Treasure buried under ground? Which rather then diminisht e're to see Thou wouldst thy self too buried with them be: And what's the difference, is't not quite as bad Never to Use, as never to have Had? In thy vast Barns millions of Quarters store, Thy Belly for all that will hold no more Then Mine does; every Baker makes much Bread, What then? He's with no more then others fed. Do you within the bounds of Nature Live, And to augment your own you need not strive, One hundred Acres will no less for you Your Life's whole business then ten thousand do. But pleasant'tis to take from a great store; What, Man? though you'r resolv'd to take no more Then I do from a small one? if your Will Be but a Pitcher or a Pot to fill, To some great River for it must you go, When a clear spring just at your feet does flow? Give me the Spring which does to humane use Safe, easie, and untroubled stores produce, He who scorns these, and needs will drink at Nile Must run the danger of the Crocodile, And of the rapid stream it self which may At unawares bear him perhaps away. In a full Flood Tantalus stands, his skin Washt o're in vain, for ever, dry within; He catches at the Stream with greedy lips, From his toucht Mouth the wanton Torment slips: You laugh now, and expand your careful brow; Tis finely said, but what's all this to you? Change but the Name, this Fable is thy story, Thou in a Flood of useless Wealth dost Glory, Which thou canst only touch but never taste; Th' abundance still, and still the want does last. The Treasures of the Gods thou wouldst not spare, But when they'r made thine own, they Sacred are, And must be kept with reverence, as if thou No other use of precious Gold didst know, But that of curious Pictures to delight With the fair stamp thy Virtuoso sight. The only true, and genuine use is this, To buy the things which Nature cannot miss Without discomfort, Oyl, and vital Bread, And Wine by which the Life of Life is fed. And all those few things else by which we live; All that remains is Giv'n for thee to Give; If Cares and Troubles, Envy, Grief and Fear, The bitter Fruits be, which fair Riches bear, If a new Poverty grow out of store; The old plain way, ye Gods, let me be Poor. A Paraphrase on an Ode in Horace's third Book, beginning thus, Inclusam Danaen turris ahenea. A tower of Brass, one would have said, And Locks, and Bolts, and Iron bars, And Guards, as strict as in the heat of wars, Might have preserv'd one Innocent Maiden-head. The jealous Father thought he well might spare, All further jealous Care, And as he walkt, t' himself alone he smil'd, To think how Venus Arts he had beguil'd; And when he slept, his rest was deep, But Venus laugh'd to see and hear him sleep. She taught the Amorous Jove A Magical receit in Love, Which arm'd him stronger, and which help'd him more, Than all his Thunder did, and his Almighty-ship before. 2. She taught him Loves Elixar, by which Art, His Godhead into Gold he did convert, No Guards did then his passage stay, He pass'd with ease; Gold was the Word; Subtle as Lightning, bright and quick and fierce, Gold through Doors and Walls did pierce; And as that works sometimes upon the sword, Melted the Maiden-head away, Even in the secret scabbard where it lay. The prudent Macedonian King, To blow up Towns, a Golden Mine did spring. He broke through Gates with this Petar, 'Tis the great Art of Peace, the Engine 'tis of War; And Fleets and Armies follow it afar, The Ensign 'tis at Land, and 'tis the Seamans Star. 3. Let all the World, slave to this Tyrant be, Creature to this Disguised Deitie, Yet it shall never conquer me. A Guard of Virtues will not let it pass, And wisdom is a Tower of stronger brass. The Muses Lawrel round my Temples spread, 'T does from this Lightnings force secure my head. Nor will I lift it up so high, As in the violent Meteors way to lye. Wealth for its power do we honour and adore? The things we hate, ill Fate, and Death, have more. 4. From Towns and Courts, Camps of the Rich and Great, The vast Xerxean Army I retreat, And to the small Laconick forces fly, Which hold the straights of Poverty. Sellars and Granaries in vain we fill, With all the bounteous Summers store, If the Mind thirst and hunger still. The poor rich Man's emphatically poor. Slaves to the things we too much prize, We Masters grow of all that we despise. 5. A Field of Corn, a Fountain and a Wood, Is all the Wealth by Nature understood, The Monarch on whom fertile Nile bestows All which that grateful Earth can bear, Deceives himse[l]f, if he suppose That more than this falls to his share. Whatever an Estate does beyond this afford, Is not a rent paid to the Lord; But is a Tax illegal and unjust, Exacted from it by the Tyrant Lust. Much will always wanting be, To him who much desires. Thrice happy He To whom the wise indulgency of Heaven, With sparing hand, but just enough has given. [8.] The dangers of an Honest man in much Company. Claudian's Old Man of Verona. Happy the Man, who his whole time doth bound Within th' enclosure of his little ground. Happy the Man, whom the same humble place, (Th' hereditary Cottage of his Race) From his first rising infancy has known, And by degrees sees gently bending down, With natural propension to that Earth Which both preserv'd his Life, and gave him birth. Him no false distant lights by fortune set, Could ever into foolish wandrings get. He never dangers either saw, or fear'd: The dreadful stormes at Sea he never heard. He never heard the shrill allarms of War, Or the worse noises of the Lawyers Bar. No change of Consuls marks to him the year, The change of seasons is his Calendar. The Cold and Heat, Winter and Summer shows, Autumn by Fruits, and Spring by Flow'rs he knows. He measures Time by Land-marks, and has found For the whole day the Dial of his ground. A neighbouring Wood born with himself he sees, And loves his old contemporary Trees. H'as only heard of near Verona's Name, And knows it like the Indies, but by Fame. Does with a like concernment notice take Of the Red-Sea, and of Benacus Lake. Thus Health and Strength he to' a third age enjoyes, And sees a long Posterity of Boys. About the spacious World let others roam, The Voyage Life is longest made at home. 9. The shortness of Life and uncertainty of Riches. [Why dost thou heap up Wealth, which thou must quit] 1 Why dost thou heap up Wealth, which thou must quit, Or, what is worse, be left by it? Why dost thou load thy self, when thou.'rt to flie, Oh Man ordain'd to die? 2 Why dost thou build up stately Rooms on high, Thou who art under Ground to lie? Thou Sow'st and Plantest, but no Fruit must see, For Death, alas! is sowing Thee. 3 Suppose, thou Fortune couldst to tameness bring, And clip or pinion her wing; Suppose thou couldst on Fate so far prevail As not to cut off thy Entail. 4 Yet Death at all that subtilty will laugh, Death will that foolish Gardner mock, Who does a slight and annual Plant engraff, Upon a lasting stock. 5 Thou dost thy self Wise and Industrious deem; A mighty Husband thou wouldst seem; Fond Man! like a bought slave, thou all the while Dost but for others Sweat and Toil. 6 Officious Fool! that needs must medling be In business that concerns not thee! For when to Future years thou' extendst thy cares Thou deal'st in other mens affairs. 7 Even aged men, as if they truly were Children again, for Age prepare, Provisions for long travail they design, In the last point of their short Line. 8 Wisely the Ant against poor Winter hoords The stock which Summers wealth affords, In Grashoppers that must at Autumn die, How vain were such an Industry? 9 Of Power and Honour the deceitful Light Might halfe excuse our cheated sight, If it of Life the whole small time would stay, And be our Sun-shine all the day, 10 Like Lightning that, begot but in a Cloud (Though shining bright, and speaking loud) Whilst it begins, concludes its violent Race, And where it Guilds, it wounds the place. 11 Oh Scene of Fortune, which dost fair appear, Only to men that stand not near! Proud Poverty, that Tinsel brav'ry wears! And, like a Rainbow, Painted Tears! 12 Be prudent, and the shore in prospect keep, In a weak Boat trust not the deep. Plac'd beneath Envy, above envying rise; Pity Great Men, Great Things despise. 13 The wise example of the Heavenly Lark, Thy Fellow-Poet, Cowley mark, Above the Clouds let thy proud Musique sound, Thy humble Nest build on the Ground. 10. The danger of Procrastination. The following verse has been extracted from the prose of this discourse. Mart. Lib. 5. Epigr. 59. To morrow you will Live, you always cry; In what far Country does this morrow lye, That 'tis so mighty long 'ere it arrive? Beyond the Indies does this Morrow live? 'Tis so far fetcht this Morrow, that I fear 'Twill be both very Old and very Dear. To morrow I will live, the Fool does say; To Day it self's too Late, the wise liv'd Yesterday. Mart. Lib. 2. Ep. 90. Wonder not, Sir (you who instruct the Town In the true Wisdom of the Sacred Gown) That I make haste to live, and cannot hold Patiently out, till I grow Rich and Old. Life for Delays and Doubts no time does give, None ever yet, made Haste enough to Live. Let him defer it, whose preposterous care Omits himself, and reaches to his Heir. Who does his Fathers bounded stores despise, And whom his own too never can suffice: My humble thoughts no glittering roofs require, Or Rooms that shine with ought but constant Fire. I well content the Avarice of my sight With the fair guildings of reflected Light: Pleasures abroad, the sport of Nature yeilds Her living Fountains, and her smiling Fields: And then at home, wha[t] pleasure is't to see A little cleanly chearful Familie? Which if a chast Wife crown, no less in Her Then Fortune, I the Golden Mean prefer. Too noble, nor too wise, she should not be, No, not too Rich, too Fair, too fond of me. Thus let my life slide silently away, With Sleep all Night, and Quiet all the Day. 11. Of My self. [This only grant me, that my means may lye] 9 This only grant me, that my means may lye Too low for Envy, for Contempt too high. Some Honor I would have Not from great deeds, but good alone. The unknown are better than ill known. Rumour can ope' the Grave, Acquaintance I would have, but when't depends Not on the number, but the choice of Friends.M 10 Books should, not business entertain the Light, And sleep, as undisturb'd as Death, the Night. My House a Cottage, more Then Palace, and should fitting be For all my Use, no Luxury. My Garden painted o're With Natures hand, not Arts; and pleasures yeild, Horace might envy in his Sabine field. 11 Thus would I double my Lifes fading space, For he that runs it well, twice runs his race. And in this true delight, These unbought sports, this happy State, I would not fear nor wish my fate, But boldly say each night, To morrow let my Sun his beams display, Or in clouds hide them; I have liv'd to Day. Martial. L. 10. Ep. 47. Vitam quæ faciunt beatio[r]em, &amp;c. Since, dearest Friend, 'tis your desire to see A true Receipt of Happiness from Me; These are the chief Ingredients, if not all; Take an Estate neither too great nor small, Which Quantum Sufficit the Doctors call. Let this Estate from Parents care descend; The getting it too much of Life does spend. Take such a Ground, whose gratitude may be A fair Encouragement for Industry. Let constant Fires the Winters fury tame; And let thy Kitchens be a Vestal Flame. Thee to the Town let never Suit at Law; And rarely, very rarely Business draw. Thy active Mind in equal Temper keep, In undisturbed Peace, yet not in sleep. Let Exercise a vigorous Health maintain, Without which all the Composition's vain. In the same weight Prudence and Innocence take, And of each does the just mixture make. But a few Friendships wear, and let them be By Nature and by Fortune fit for thee. In stead of Art and Luxury in food, Let Mirth and Freedome make thy Table good. If any cares into thy Day-time creep, At night, without Wines Opium, let them sleep. Let rest, which Nature does to Darkness wed, And not Lust, recommend to thee thy Bed, Be satisfi'd, and pleas'd with what thou art; Act chearfully and well th' alotted part, Enjoy the present Hour, be thankful for the Past, And neither fear, nor wish th' approaches of the last. Martial Book 10. Epigram 96. Me who have liv'd so long among the great, You wonder to hear talk of a Retreat: And a retreat so distant, as may show No thoughts of a return when once I go. Give me a Country, how remote so e're, Where happiness a mod'rate rate does bear, Where poverty it self in plenty flowes, And all the solid use of Riches knowes. The ground about the house maintains it there, The House maintains the ground about it here. Here even Hunger's dear, and a full board, Devours the vital substance of the Lord. The Land it self does there the feast bestow, The Land it self must here to Market go. Three or four suits one Winter here does wast, One suit does there three or four winters last. Here every frugal Man must oft be cold, And little Luke-warm-fires are to you sold. There Fire's an Element as cheap and free, Almost as any of the other Three. Stay you then here, and live among the Great, Attend their sports, and at their tables eat. When all the bounties here of Men you score: The Places bounty there, shall give me more. To the Duke of Buckingham, upon his Marriage with the Lord Fairfax his Daughter. 1. Beauty and strength together came, Even from the Birth with Buckingham; The little active Seeds which since are grown So fair, so large and high, With Life it self were in him sown; Honour and wealth stood like the Midwifes by, To take the Birth into their happy Hands, And wrapt him warme in their rich swaddling Bands: To the great Stock the thriving Infant soon Made greater Acquisitions of his own; With Beauty generous Goodness he Combin'd, Courage to Strength, Judgment to Wit he joyn'd; He pair'd, and match'd his Native Virtues right, Both to improve their use, and their Delight. 2. O blest Conjunction of the fairest Stars, That Shine in Humane Natures Sphere! But O! what envious Cloud your Influence bars, Ill fortune, what dost thou do there? Hadst thou the least of Modesty, Thou'dst be asham'd that we should see Thy deform'd Looks, and Dress, in such a Company: Thou wert deceiv'd, rash Goddess, in thy hate, If thou dist foolishly believe That thou could'st him of ought deprive, But, what men hold of thee, a great Estate. And here indeed thou to the full did shew All that thy Tyrant Deity could do, His Virtues never did thy power obey, In dissipating Storms, and routed Battles they Did close and constant with their Captain stay; They with him into Exile went, And kept their Home in Banishment. The Noble Youth was often forc'd to flee From the insatiate Rage of thee, Disguised, and Unknown; In all His shap'es they always kept their own, Nay, with the Foil of darkness, brighter shone, And might Unwillingly have don, But, that just Heaven thy wicked Will abhor'd, What Virtues most detest, might have betrayd their Lord. 3. Ah slothful Love, could'st thou with patience see Fortune usurp that flowry Spring from thee; And nip thy rosy Season with a Cold, That comes too soon, when Life's short year grows old, Love his gross Error saw at last, And promis'd large amends for what was past, He promis'd, and has don it, which is more Than I, who knew him long, e'er knew him do before. H' has done it Nobly, and we must confess Could do no more, though h' ought to do no less. What has he don? he has repair'd The Ruines which a luckless War did make, And added to it a Reward Greater than Conquest for its share could take. His whole Estate could not such gain produce, Had it layd out a hundred years at use. 4. Now blessings to thy Noble choice betide, Happy, and Happy-making Bride. Though thou art born of a Victorious Race, And all their rougher Victorie dost grace With gentle Triumphs of thy Face, Permit us in this milder War to prize No less thy yeilding Heart, than thy Victorious Eyes. Nor doubt the honour of that field, Where thou didst first overcome, e'er thou didst yield. And tho' thy Father's Martial Name Has fill'd the Trumpets and the Drums of Fame, Thy Husband triumphs now no less than He, And it may justly question'd be, Which was the Happiest Conqueror of the Three. 5. There is in Fate (which none but Poets see) There is in Fate the noblest Poetry, And she has shown, Great Duke, her utmost Art in Thee; For after all the troubles of thy Scene, Which so confus'd, and intricate have been, She has ended with this Match thy Tragicomedy; We all admire it, for the truth to tell, Our Poet Fate ends not all Plays so well; But this she as her Master-piece does boast, And so indeed She may; For in the middle Acts, and turnings of the Play, Alas! we gave our Hero up for lost. All men, I see, this with Applause receive, And now let me have leave, A Servant of the Person, and the Art, To Speak this Prologue to the second part. A POEM On the late CIVIL WAR. What Rage does England from it self divide, More than the Seas from all the World beside. From every part the roaring Cannons play, From every part Blood roars as loud as they. What English Ground but still some Moisture bears, Of Young Mens Blood, and more of Mothers Tears! What Airs unthickened with the Sighs of Wives, Tho' more of Maids for their dear Lovers Lives. Alas, what Triumphs can this Victory shew, That dies us Red in Blood and Blushes too! How can we wish that Conquest, which bestows Cypress, not Bays, upon the Conquering Brows, It was not so when Henry's dreadful Name, Not Sword, nor Cause, whole Nations overcame. To farthest West did his swift Conquests run, Nor did his Glory set but with the Sun. In vain did Roderic to his Hold retreat, In vain had wretched Ireland call'd him Great. Ireland! which now most basely we begin To labour more to lose than he to win, It was not so when in the happy East, Richard our Mars, Venus's Isle possest. 'Gainst the proud Moon, he the English Cross display'd, Ecclips'd one Horn, and the other paler made. When our dear Lives we ventured bravely there, And digg'd our own to gain Christs Sepulchre. That sacred Tomb which should we now enjoy, We should with as much zeal fight to destroy. The precious Signs of our dead Lord we scorn, And see his Cross worse than his Body torn. We hate it now both for the Greek and Jew, To us 'tis Fo[o]lishness and Scandal to[o]. To what with Worship the fond Papist falls, That the fond Zealot a cursed Idol calls. So, 'twixt their double Madness here's the odds, One makes false Devils, t'other makes false Gods. It was not so when Edward prov'd his Cause, By a Sword stronger than the Salique Laws. Tho fetched from Pharamond, when the French did fight, With Womens Hearts against the Womens Right. The afflicted Ocean his first Conquest bore, And drove Red Waves to the sad Gallique Shore: As if he had Angry with that Element been, Which his wide Soul bound with an Island in. Where's now that spirit with which at Cressey we, And Poictiers forced from fate a Victory? Two Kings at once we brought sad Captives home, A Triumph scarcely known to ancient Rome; Two Foreign Kings, but now alas we strive, Our own, our own good Soveraign to Captive! It was not so when Agincourt was won, Under great Henry served the Rain and Sun, A Nobler Fight the Sun himself ne'r knew, Not when he stop'd his Course a Fight to view! Then Death's old Archer did more skilful grow, And learned to shoot more sure from th' English bow; Then France was her own story sadly taught, And felt how Cæsar and how Edward fought. It was not so when that vast Fleet of Spain, Lay torn and scatter'd on the English Main; Through the proud World, a Virgin, terror struck, The Austrian Crowns and Rome's seven hills she shook: To her great Neptune Homaged all his Streams And all the wide-stretched Ocean was her Thames. Thus our Fore-Fathers Fought, Thus bravely bled, Thus still they live, whil'st we alive are dead; Such Acts they did that Rome and Cæsar too, Might Envy those, whom once they did subdue. We're not their off-spring, sure our Heralds Lie, But Born we know not how, as now we Die; Their precious Blood we could not venture thus: Some Cadmus sure sow'd Serpents teeth for us; We could not else by mutual Fury fall, Whilst Rhine and Sequan for our Armies call: Chuse War or Peace, you have a Prince you know, As fit for both, as both are fit for you. Furious as Lightning when Wars Tempest came, But Calm in Peace, Calm as a Lambent Flame. Have you forgot those happy years of late, That saw nought ill, but us that were Ingrate; Such years, as if Earths youth Return'd had been, And that old Serpent Time had Cast his Skin: As Gloriously, and Gently did they move, As the bright Sun that Measures them above; Then onely in Books the Learn'd could misery see, And the Unlearned ne're heard of Misery. Then happy James with as deep Quiet Reigned, As in His heavenly Throne, by Death, he gained. And least this blessing with his Life should Cease, He left us Charles the Pledge of future Peace. Charles under whom, with much ado, no less Than sixteen years, we endur'd our happiness; Till in a Moment, in the North we find, A Tempest Conjured up without a Wind. As soon the North her Kindness did Repent, First the Peace-Maker, and next War she sent: Just Tweed that now had with long Peace forgot On which side dwelt the English, which the Scot: Saw glittering Arms shine sadly on his face; Whil'st all the affrighted Fish sank down apace; No blood did then from this dark Quarrel grow, It gave blunt wounds, that bled not out till now! For Jove, who might have us'd his thundring power, Chose to fall calmly in a Golden showre! A way we found to Conquer, which by none Of all our thrifty Ancestors was known; So strangly Prodigal of late we are, We there buy Peace, and here at home buy War. How could a war so sad and barbarous please, But first by slandring those blest days of Peace? Through all the Excrements of State they pry, Like Emp'ricks to find out a Malady; And then with Desperate boldness they endeavor, Th' Ague to cure by bringing in a Feavor: The way is sure to expel some ill no doubt, The Plague we know, drives all Diseases out. What strange wild fears did every Morning breed, Till a strange fancy made us sick indeed? And Cowardise did Valours place supply, Like those that kill themselves for fear to die! What frantick Diligence in these Men appears, That fear all Ills, and act o'r all their Fears? Thus into War we scared ourselves; and who But Aaron's Sons, that the first Trumpet blew. Fond Men! who knew not that they were to keep For God, and not for Sacrifice, their Sheep. The Churches first this Murderous Doctrine sow, And learn to Kill as well as Bury now. The Marble Tombs where our Fore-fathers lie, Sweated with dread of too much company: And all their sleeping Ashes shook for fear, Least thousand Ghosts should come and shroud them there. Petitions next from every Town they frame, To be restored to them from whom they came. The same stile all, and the same sense does pen, Alas, they allow set Forms of Prayer to Men. Oh happy we, if Men would neither hear Their studied Form, nor God their sudden Prayer. They will be heard, and in unjustest wise, The many-Headed Rout for Justice cries. They call for Blood, which now I fear does call For Blood again, much louder than they all. In sensless Clamours, and confused Noise, We lost that rare, and yet unconquer'd Voice: So when the sacred Thracian Lyre was drown'd, In the Bistonian Womens mixed sound. The wondring Stones, that came before to hear, Forgot themselves, and turn'd his Murderers there. The same loud Storm, blew the Grave Mitre down; It blew down that, and with it shook the Crown. Then first a State, without a Church begun; Comfort thy self dear Church, for then 'twas done. The same great Storm, to Sea great Mary drove, The Sea could not such dangerous Tempests move. The same drove Charles into the North, and then Would Readilier far have driven him back agen. To fly from noise of Tumults is no shame, Ne'r will their Armies force them to the same: They all his Castles, all his Towns invade, He's a large Prisoner in all England made! He must not pass to Irelands weeping Shore, The Wounds these Surgeons make must yield them more: He must not conquer his lewd Rebels there, Least he should learn by that to do it here. The Sea they subject next to their command, The Sea that Crowns our Kings and all their Land. Thus poor they leave him, their base Pride and Scorn, As poor as these, now mighty Men, were born. When straight whole Armies meet in Charle[s]'s Right, How no Man knows, but here they are and Fight. A Man would swear that saw this altered State, Kings were called Gods, because they could Create Vain Men; 'tis Heaven this first Assistance brings, The same is Lord of Hosts, that's King of Kings. Had Men forsook him, Angels from above, (The Assyrian did less their Justice move.) Would all have mustered in his Righteous Aid, And Thunder against your Cannon would have play'd. It needs not so, for Man desires to right Abused Mankind, and wretches you must fight. Worster first saw't, and trembled at the view, Too well the Ills of Civil War she knew. Twice did the Flames of old her Towers invade, Twice call'd she in vain for her own Severn's Aid. Here first the Rebel Winds began to roar, Brake loose from the just Fetters which they bore. Here Mutinous Waves above their shore did swell, And the first Storm of that Dire Winter fell. But when the two great Brethren once appeared, And their bright Heads like Leda's off-spring rear'd, When those Sea-calming Sons, from Jove were spied, The Winds all fled, the Waves all sunk and died! How fought great Rupert, with what Rage and Skill? Enough to have Conquered had his Cause been ill! Comely Young Man; and yet his dreadful sight, The Rebels Blood to their faint Hearts does fright. In vain alas it seeks so weak defence; For his keen Sword brings it again from thence: Yet grieves he at the Lawrels thence he bore; Alas poor Prince, they'll fight with him no more. His Vertue will be eclipsed with too much Fame, Henceforth he will not Conquer, but his Name: Here — with tainted Blood the Field did stain, By his own Sacriledge, and's Countrys Curses slain. The first Commander did Heavens Vengeance shew, And led the Rebels Van to shades below. On two fair Hills both Armies next are seen, The affrighted Valley sighs and sweats between; Here Angels did, with fair Expectance stay, And wish'd good things to a King as mild as they; There Fiends with hunger waiting did abide, And Cursed both, but spurr'd on the guilty side. Here stood Religion, her looks gently sage, Aged, but much more comely for her Age! There Schism Old Hagg, tho' seeming young appears, As Snakes by casting skins, Renew their years; Undecent Rags of several Dies she wore, And in her hand torn Liturgies she bore. Here Loyalty an humble Cross display'd, And still as Charles pass'd by, she bow'd and pray'd. Sedition there her Crimson Banner spreads, Shakes all her Hands, and roars with all her Heads. Her knotty Hairs were with dire Serpents twist, And every Serpent at each other hist. Here stood White Truth, and her own Host does bless, Clad with those Armes of Proof her Nakedness. There Perjuries like Cannons roar aloud, And Lies flew thick, like Cannons smoaky Cloud. Here Learning and th' Arts met, as much they fear'd As when the Hunns of old and Goths appear'd. What should they do, unapt themselves to fight, They promised noble Pens the Acts to write. There Ignorance advanced, and joy'd to spy So many that durst fight they know not why. From those, who most the slow-soul'd Monks disdain, From those she hopes the Monks dull Age again, Here Mercy waits with sad but gentle look, Never alass had she her Charles forsook! For Mercy on her Friends, to Heaven she cries, Whilst Justice pulls down Vengeance from the Skies. Oppression there, Rapine and Murder stood Ready as was the Field to drink their Blood. A thousand wronged Spirits amongst them moan'd, And thrice the Ghost of mighty Strafford groan'd. Now flew their Cannon thick through wounded Air, Sent to defend, and kill their Soveraign there. More than he them, the Bullets feared his Head, And at his Feet lay innocently Dead. They knew not what those Men that sent them meant, And acted their pretence not their intent. This was the Day, this the first Day that shew'd How much to Charles for our long Peace we ow'd: By his Skill here, and Spirit we understood, From War naught kept him but his Countries good. In his great Looks, what chearful Anger shone, Sad War, and joyful Triumphs mixed in one. In the same Beams of his Majestick Eye, His own Men Life, his Foes did Death espy. Great Rupert this, that Wing great Willmott leads, White-feathered Conquest, flies o'r both their Heads. They charge, as if alone, they'd beat the Foe; Whether their Troops followed them up or no. They follow close and haste into the fight, As swift as strait the Rebels made their flight. So swift the Miscreants fly, as if each fear And jealousie they framed, had met them there. They heard Wars Musick, and away they flew, The Trumpets fright worse than the Organs do. Their Souls which still, new by-ways do invent, Out at their wounded Backs perversly went. Pursue no more, ye Noble Victors stay, Least too much Conquest lose so brave a day: For still the Battail sounds behind, and Fate Will not give all; but sets us here a Rate: Too dear a rate she sets, and we must pay One honest Man, for ten such Knaves as they. Streams of Black tainted Blood the Field besmear, But pure well coloured drops shine here and there: They scorn to mix with flouds of baser veines, Just as the nobler moisture, Oyl disdains. Thus fearless Lindsey, thus bold Aubigny, Amid'st the Corps of slaughtered Rebels lie: More honourably than ? ? e'r was found, With troops of living Traytors circled round. Rest valiant Souls in peace, ye sacred pair, And all whose Deaths attended on you there: You'r kindly welcomed to Heavens peaceful coast, By all the reverend Martyrs Noble Host. Your soaring Souls they meet with triumph, all Led by great Stephen their old General. Go ? ? now prefer thy flourishing State, Above those murdered Heroes doleful fate. Enjoy that life which thou durst basely save, And thought'st a Saw-pit nobler than a Grave, Thus many saved themselves, and Night the rest, Night that agrees with their dark Actions best. A dismal shade did Heavens sad Face o'r flow, Dark as the night, slain Rebels found below. No gentle Stars their chearful Glories rear'd, Ashamed they were at what was done, and fear'd Least wicked Men their bold excuse should frame From some strange Influence, and so vail their shame. To Duty thus, Order and Law incline, They who ne'r Err from one eternal Line. As just the Ruin of these Men they thought, As Sisera's was, 'gainst whom themselves had fought. Still they Rebellions ends remember well Since Lucifer the Great, their shining Captain fell. For this the Bells they ring, and not in vain, Well might they all ring out for thousands slain. For this the Bonefires, their glad Lightness spread, When Funeral Flames might more befit their dead. For this with solemn thanks they tire their God, And whilst they feel it, mock th' Almighties Rod. They proudly now abuse his Justice more, Than his long Mercies they abu'sd before. Yet these the Men that true Religion boast, The Pure and Holy, Holy, Holy, Host! What great reward for so much Zeal is given? Why, Heaven has thank'd them since as they thank'd Heaven. Witness thou Brainford, say thou Ancient Town, How many in thy Streets fell grovelling down. Witness the Red Coats weltering in their Gore, And died anew into the Name they bore. Witness their Men blowed up into the Air, All Elements their Ruins joyed to share. In the wide Air quick Flames their Bodies tore, Then drown'd in Waves, thei'r tost by Waves to shore. Witness thou Thames, thou wast amazed to see Men madly run to save themselves in thee. In vain, for Rebels Lives thou woul[d]st not save, And down they sunk beneath thy conquering Wave. Good reverend Thames, the best beloved of all Those noble Blood, that meet at Neptune's Hall; London's proud Towers, which do thy Head adorn, Are not thy Glory now, but Grief and Scorn. Thou grievest to see the White named Palace shine, Without the Beams of it's own Lord and thine: Thy Lord which is to all as good and free, As thou kind Flood to thine own Banks can be. How does thy peaceful Back disdain to bear The Rebels busie Pride at Westminster. Thou who thy self doest without murmuring pay Eternal Tribute to thy Prince the Sea. To Oxford next Great Charles in Triumph came, Oxford the British Muses second Fame. Here Learning with some State and Reverence looks, And dwells in Buildings lasting as her Books; Both now Eternal, but they had Ashes been, Had these Religious Vandals once got in. Not Bodley's Noble Work their Rage would spare, For Books they know the chief Malignants are. In vain they silence every Age before, For Pens of Time to come will wound them more. The Temples decent Wealth, and modest State, Had suffered, this their Avarice, that their Hate. Beggary and Scorn into the Church they'd bring, And make God Glorious, as they made the King. O happy Town, that to Lov'd Charles's Sight, In those sad Times givest Safety and Delight. The Fate which Civil War it self doth bless, Scarce wouldst thou change; for Peace this happiness. Amidst all Joys which Heaven allows thee here, Think on thy Sister, and then shed a tear. What Fights did this sad Winter see each day, Her Winds and Storms came not so thick as they! Yet nought these far lost Rebels could recall, Not Marlborough's nor Cirencester's fall. Yet still for Peace the Gentle Conqueror sues, By his Wrath they Perish, yet his Love refuse. Nor yet is the plain Lesson understood, Writ by kind Heaven, in B? and H?'s Blood. Chad and his Church saw where their Enemy lay, And with just Red, new marked their Holy day. Fond Men, this Blow the injured Crosier strook, Naught was more fit to perish but thy Book. Such fatal Vengeance did wronged Charlegrove shew, Where ? ? both begun and ended to[o]. His cursed Rebellion, where his Soul's repaid With separation, great as that he made. ? ? Whose Spirit moved o'r this mighty Frame, O' th Brittish Isle, and out this Chaos came. — The Man that taught Confusions Art, His Treasons restless and yet noisless Heart. His Active Brain, like Ætna's Top appear'd, Where Treason's forged, yet no noise outward heard. 'Twas he continued what e'r bold M? said, And all the popular noise that P? has made. 'Twas he that taught the Zealous Rout to rise, And be his Slaves for some feigned Liberties. Him for this Black Design, Hell thought most fit, Ah! wretched Man, cursed by too good a Wit. If not all this your stubborn Hearts can fright, Think on the West, think on the Cornish might: The Saxon Fury, to that far stretch'd place, Drove the torn Reliques of great Brutus Race. Here they of old, did in long safety lie, Compassed with Seas, and a worse Enemy. Ne'r till this time, ne'r did they meet with Foes More Cruel and more Barbarous than those. Ye noble Brittains, who so oft with Blood Of Pagan Hosts, have died old Tamar's Flood, If any drop of mighty Uther still, Or Uther's mighty'r Son your Veins does fill, Shew then that Spirit, till all Men think by you The doubtful Tales of your great Arthur true. You have shewn it Britains, and have often done Things that have cheared the weary setting Sun. Again did Tamar your dread Arms behold, As just and as successful as the Old: It kissed the Cornish Banks, and vow'd to bring His richest Waves to feed the ensuing Spring; But murmur'd sadly, and almost deny'd All fruitful Moisture to the Devon side. Ye Sons of War, by whose bold Acts we see How great a thing exalted Man may be; The World remains your Debtor, that as yet Ye have not all gone forth and conquerd it. I knew that Fate some wonders for you meant, When matchless Hopton to your Coasts she sent. Hopton! so wise, he needs not Fortunes Aid, So fortunate his Wisdom's useless made. Should his so often tryed Companions fail, His Spirit, alone, and Courage would prevail. Miraculous Man! how would I sing thy praise, Had any Muse crowned me with half the Bays Conquest hath given to thee; and next thy Name Should Berkly, Stanning, Digby press to Fame. Godolphin thee, thee Greenvil I'd rehearse, But Tears break off my Verse, How oft has vanquished Stamford backward fled, Swift as the parted Souls of those he led! How few did his huge Multitudes defeat, For most are Ciphers when the Number's great. Numbers alass of Men, that made no more, Than he himself Ten Thousand times told o'r. Who hears of Stratton Fight, but must confess All that he heard or read before was less. Sad Germany can no such Trophy boast, For all the Blood these twenty years sh' has lost. Vast was their Army, and their Arms were more Than th' Host of Hundred-handed Gyants bore. So strong their Arms, it did almost appear Secure, had neither Arms nor Men been there. In Hopton breaks, in break the Cornish Powers, Few and scarce Arm'd, yet was the advantage ours. What doubts could be, their outward strength to win, When we bore Arms and Magazine within. The violent Swords out-did the Muskets ire, It strook the Bones, and there gave dreadful fire: We scorned their Thunder and the reaking Blade, A thicker Smoak than all their Cannon made. Death and loud Tumults fill'd the place around; With fruitless rage; fallen Rebels bite the Ground, The Arms we gain'd, were Wealth, Bodies, of the Foe, All that a full fraught Victory can bestow. Yet stays not Hopton thus, but still proceeds, Pursues himself through all his glorious deeds. With Hertford, and the Prince, he joyns his fate, The Belgian Trophies on their journey wait. The Prince who oft had check'd proud W? fame. And fool'd that flying Conquerours empty name: Till by his loss that fertile Monster thriv'd, This Serpent cut in parts rejoyn'd and liv'd. It liv'd and would have stung us deeper yet, But that bold Greenvil its whole fury met. He sold like Decius his devoted Breath, And left the Common-Wealth Heir to his Death. Hail mighty Ghost! look from on high and see How much our Hands and Swords remember thee. At Roundway Heath, our Rage at thy great fall, Whet all our Spirits, and made us Greenvils all. One thousand Horse beat all their numerous power; Bless me! and where was then their Conqueror! Coward of Fame, he flies in haste away, Men, Arms, and Name leaves us the Victors Prey. What meant those Iron Regiments which he brought, That moving Statues seemd and so they fought. No way for Death but by Disease appear'd, Cannon and Mines a Siege they scarcely feared: Till 'gainst all hopes they prov'd in this sad sight, Too weak to stand, and yet too slow for fight. The Furies houl'd aloud through trembling Air, Th' astonish'd Snakes fell sadly from their Hair, To Lud's proud Town their hasty flight they took, The Towers and Temples at their entrance shook: In vain their Loss the' attempted to disguise, And mustred up new Troops of fruitless lies: God fought himself, nor could th' event be less, Bright Conquest walks the Fields in all her dress. Could this white day a Gift more grateful bring? Oh yes! it brought bless'd Mary to the King! In Keynton Field they met, at once they view Their former Victory and enjoy a new. Keynton the Place that Fortune did approve, To be the noblest Scene of War and Love; Through the Glad vail, Ten thousand Cupids fled And Chas'd the wandring spirits of Rebels dead, Still the lewd scent of Powder did they fear, And scatter'd Eastern smells through all the Air. Look happy Mount, look well, for this is she, That Toyl'd and Travel'd for thy Victory, Thy flourishing Head to her with reverence bow, To her thou owest that Fame which Crowns thee now. From far stretcht Shores they felt her spirit, and might: Princes and God at any distance fight. At her return well might sh'a Conquest have, Whose very absence such a Conquest gave. This in the West, nor did the North bestow Less Cause their usual gratitude to show; With much of state brave Cavendish led them forth, As swift and fierce as tempest from the North. Cavendish whom every Grace and every Muse, Kiss'd at his Birth; and for their own did chuse: So good a Wit they meant not should excel In Arms, but now they see't and like it well: So large is that rich Empire of his heart, Well may they rest contented with a Part; How soon he forc'd the Northern Clouds to flight, And struck Confusion into Form and Light! Scarce did the Power Divine in fewer days, A peaceful World out of a Chaos raise. Bradford and Leeds propt up their sinking fame, They bragg'd of Hosts, and Fairfax was a name. Leeds, Bradford, Fairfax Powers are strait their own, As quickly as they vote Men overthrown. Bootes from his Wain look'd down below, And saw our Victory move not half so slow. I see the Gallant Earl break through the Foes, In Dust and Sweat how gloriously he shows. I see him lead the Pikes; What will he do? Defend him Heaven, Oh whither will he go? Up to the Cannons mouth he leads! in vain They speak loud Death and threaten till they'r ta'ne. So Capaneu's two Armies fill'd with Wonder, When he charged Jove and grappled with his Thunder. Both Hosts with silence, and with terror shook, As if not he, but they were thunder-strook: The Courage here, and Boldness was no less, Onely the Cause was better and Success. Heaven will let naught be by their Cannon done, Since at Edghil they sin'd and Burlington. Go now your silly Calumnies repeat, And make all Papists whom you cannot beat. Let the World know some way, with whom you are vext, And vote'em Turks when they overthrow you next. Why will you die fond Men, why will you buy, At this fond rate, your Countreys slavery? Is't liberty! what are those threats we hear, Why do you thus th' Old and New Prison fill? When that's the onely why; because you will? Fain would you make God too thus tyranous be, And damn poor Men by such a stiff Decree: Is't property? why do such numbers then, From God beg Vengeance and Relief from Men? Why are the Estates and Good's seiz'd on of all Whom Covetous or Malicious Men miscall? What's more our own than our own Lives? But oh Could Yeoman's, or could Bourchier find it so? The Barbarous Coward alway's used to fly, Did know no other way to see men die. Or is't Religion? What then mean your Lies Your Sacriledges and Pulpit Blasphemies, Why are all Sect's let loose, that ere had Birth, Since Luther's noise wak'd the Lethargick Earth, The Author went no further. APPENDIX. Coolyes verses uppon my Lady Elisabeth birth on Christmass even 1635. (From Harleian MSS. 6383: first printed by Dr Grosart in his Edition of Cowley.) Your picture mighty P. ingrav'd in gould whiche from your picture doth more lustre hould men to their frends for gratulation send when Janus doth beginn the yeard and end: Nature wch muche from your large hand receaves for new-years-guift to thee thyne image gives of farr more worth then thy goulds lovely print both for the graver mettall and the mint: what better auspice could the year beginn? what richer crown for Janus head to beare? well may we know yr spring time forward creeps from th' fertile roote a new frenche lilly peeps: go on wise nature, and with equall care eache twelvemonth suche a new-years guift prepare. Thou, whom 4. kingdomes for their father know, art father only of 4. children now. Oh lett the number of thy of-spring mount till we thy children by thy citties count: leave thy self with us diversly, or we at the fear'd day shall envy heav'n to thee, whiche mayst thou late enjoy and Nestor be in years, as now thou art in prudency. And when ould age that over Princes raignes, hath scatterd could, and fayntnes through thy veyns, and made thee weake such travaile to sustayn, mayst thou be carried there in thine owne wayn. A. COWLEY. Upon the happie Birth of the Duke. From Voces Votivae ab Academicis Cantabrigiensibus etc. MDCXL. Whilst the rude North Charles his slow wrath doth call, Whilst warre is fear'd, and conquest hop'd by all, The severall shires their various forces lend, And some do men, some gallant horses send, Some steel, and some (the stronger weapon) gold. These warlike contributions are but old: That countrey learn'd a new and better way, Which did this royall Prince for Tribute pay. Who shall henceforth be with such rage possest, To rouze our English Lion from his rest? When a new Sonne doth his blest stock adorn, Then to great Charles is a new Armie born. In private births Hopes challenge the first place: There's Certaintie at first in the Kings race; And we may say, Such will his glories be, Such his great acts, and, yet not prophesie. I see in him his Father's boundlesse sprite, Powerfull as flame, yet gentle as the light. I see him through an adverse battel thrust, Bedeck'd with noble sweat and comely dust. I see the pietie of the day appeare, Joyn'd with the heate and valour of the yeare, Which happie Fate did to this birth allow: I see all this; for sure't is present now. Leave off then, London, to accuse the starres For adding a worse terrour to the warres; Nor quarrel with the heavens, 'cause they beginne To send the worst effect and scourge of sinne, That dreadful plague, which, wheresoe're't abide, Devours both man and each disease beside. For every life which from great Charles does flow, And's Female self, weighs down a crowd of low And vulgar souls: Fate rids of them the earth, To make more room for a great Princes birth. So when the sunne, after his watrie rest, Comes dancing from his chamber of the East, A thousand pettie lamps spread ore the skie, Shrink in their doubtfull beams; then wink, and die: Yet no man grieves; the very birds arise, And sing glad notes in stead of Elegies: The leaves and painted flowers, which did erewhile Tremble with mournfull drops, beginne to smile. The losse of many why should they bemone, Who for them more then many have in one? How blest must thou thy self, bright Mary, be, Who by thy wombe canst blesse our miserie? May't still be fruitfull. May your offspring too Spread largely, as your fame and virtues do. Fill every season thus: Time, which devours Its own sonnes, will be glad and proud of yours. So will the Year (though sure it weari'd be With often revolutions) when't shall see The honour by such births it doth attain, Joy to return into it self again. A. Cowley, A.B.T.C.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miscellanies. THE MOTTO. Tentanda via est, &amp;c. What shall I do to be for ever known, And make the Age to come my own? I shall like Beasts or Common People dy, Unless you write my Elegy; Whilst others Great, by being Born are grown, Their Mothers Labour, not their own. In this Scale Gold, in th'other Fame does ly, The weight of that, mounts this so high. These men are Fortunes Jewels, moulded bright; Brought forth with their own fire and light. If I, her vulgar stone for either look; Out of my self it must be strook. Yet I must on; what sound is't strikes mine ear? Sure I Fames Trumpet hear. It sounds like the last Trumpet; for it can Raise up the bur'ied Man. Unpast Alpes stop me, but I'll cut through all, And march, the Muses Hannibal. Hence all the flattering vanities that lay Nets of Roses in the way. Hence the desire of Honors, or Estate; And all, that is not above Fate. Hence Love himself, that Tyrant of my days, Which intercepts my coming praise. Come my best Friends, my Books, and lead me on; 'Tis time that I were gon. Welcome, great Stagirite, and teach me now All I was born to know. Thy Scholars vict'ries thou dost far out-do; He conquer'd th' Earth, the whole World you. Welcome learn'd Cicero, whose blest Tongue and Wit Preserves Romes greatness yet. Thou art the first of Ora'tors; only he Who best can praise Thee, next must be. Welcome the Mantu'an Swan, Virgil the Wise, Whose verse walks highest, but not flies. Who brought green Poesie to her perfect Age; And made that Art which was a Rage. Tell me, ye mighty Three, what shall I do To be like one of you. But you have climb'd the Mountains top, there sit On the calm flour'ishing head of it, And whilst with wearied steps we upward go, See Us, and Clouds below. ODE. Of Wit. 1 Tell me, O tell, what kind of thing is Wit, Thou who Master art of it. For the First matter loves Variety less; Less Women love't, either in Love or Dress. A thousand different shapes it bears, Comely in thousand shapes appears. Yonder we saw it plain; and here 'tis now, Like Spirits in a Place, we know not How. 2 London that vents of false Ware so much store, In no Ware deceives us more. For men led by the Colour, and the Shape, Like Zeuxes Birds fly to the painted Grape; Some things do through our Judgment pass As through a Multiplying Glass. And sometimes, if the Object be too far, We take a Falling Meteor for a Star. 3 Hence 'tis a Wit that greatest word of Fame Grows such a common Name. And Wits by our Creation they become, Just so, as Tit'lar Bishops made at Rome. 'Tis not a Tale, 'tis not a Jest Admir'd with Laughter at a feast, Nor florid Talk which can that Title gain; The Proofs of Wit for ever must remain. 4 'Tis not to force some lifeless Verses meet With their five gowty feet. All ev'ry where, like Mans, must be the Soul, And Reason the Inferior Powers controul. Such were the Numbers which could call The Stones into the Theban wall. Such Miracles are ceast; and now we see No Towns or Houses rais'd by Poetrie. 5 Yet 'tis not to adorn, and gild each part; That shows more Cost, then Art. Jewels at Nose and Lips but ill appear; Rather then all things Wit, let none be there. Several Lights will not be seen, If there be nothing else between. Men doubt, because they stand so thick i' th' skie, If those be Stars which paint the Galaxie. 6 'Tis not when two like words make up one noise; Jests for Dutch Men, and English Boys. In which who finds out Wit, the same may see In An'grams and Acrostiques Poetrie. Much less can that have any place At which a Virgin hides her face, Such Dross the Fire must purge away; 'tis just The Author blush, there where the Reader must. 7 'Tis not such Lines as almost crack the Stage When Bajazet begins to rage. Nor a tall Meta'phor in the Bombast way, Nor the dry chips of short lung'd Seneca. Nor upon all things to obtrude, And force some odd Similitude. What is it then, which like the Power Divine We only can by Negatives define? 8 In a true piece of Wit all things must be, Yet all things there agree. As in the Ark, joyn'd without force or strife, All Creatures dwelt; all Creatures that had Life. Or as the Primitive Forms of all (If we compare great things with small) Which without Discord or Confusion lie, In that strange Mirror of the Deitie. 9 But Love that moulds One Man up out of Two, Makes me forget and injure you. I took you for my self sure when I thought That you in any thing were to be Taught. Correct my error with thy Pen; And if any ask me then, What thing right Wit, and height of Genius is, I'll onely shew your Lines, and say, 'Tis This. To the Lord Falkland. For his safe Return from the Northern Expedition against the SCOTS. Great is thy Charge, O North; be wise and just, England commits her Falkland to thy trust; Return him safe: Learning would rather choose Her Bodley, or her Vatican to loose. All things that are but writ or printed there, In his unbounded Breast engraven are. There all the Sciences together meet, And every Art does all her Kindred greet, Yet justle not, nor quarrel; but as well Agree as in some Common Principle. So in an Army govern'd right we see (Though out of several Countrys rais'd it be) That all their Order and their Place maintain, The English, Dutch, the Frenchmen and the Dane. So thousand diverse Species fill the aire, Yet neither crowd nor mix confus'dly there, Beasts, Houses, Trees, and Men together lye, Yet enter undisturb'd into the Eye. And this great Prince of Knowledge is by Fate Thrust into th' noise and business of a State, All Virtues, and some Customs of the Court, Other mens Labour, are at least his Sport. Whilst we who can no action undertake, Whom Idleness it self might Learned make, Who hear of nothing, and as yet scarce know, Whether the Scots in England be or no, Pace dully on, oft tire, and often stay, Yet see his nimble Pegasus fly away. 'Tis Natures fault who did thus partial grow, And her Estate of Wit on One bestow. Whilst we like younger Brothers, get at best But a small stock, and must work out the rest. How could he answer't, should the State think fit To question a Monopoly of Wit? Such is the Man whom we require the same We lent the North; untoucht as is his Fame. He is too good for War, and ought to be As far from Danger, as from Fear he's free. Those Men alone (and those are useful too) Whose Valour is the onely Art they know, Were for sad War and bloody Battels born; Let Them the State Defend, and He Adorn. On the Death of Sir Henry Wootton. What shall we say, since silent now is He Who when he Spoke, all things would Silent be? Who had so many Languages in store, That onely Fame shall speak of him in More. Whom England now no more return'd must see. He's gone to Heav'n on his Fourth Embassie. On earth he travell'd often; not to say H'had been abroad, or pass loose Time away. In whatsoever Land he chanc'd to come, He read the Men and Manners, bringing home Their Wisdom, Learning, and their Pietie, As if he went to Conquer, not to See. So well he understood the most and best Of Tongues that Babel sent into the West, Spoke them so truly, that he had (you'd swear) Not only Liv'd, but been Born every where. Justly each Nations Speech to him was known, Who for the World was made, not us alone. Nor ought the Language of that Man be less Who in his Breast had all things to express. We say that Learning's endless, and blame Fate For not allowing Life a longer date. He did the utmost Bounds of Knowledge find, He found them not so large as was his Mind. But, like the brave Pellæan Youth, did mone Because that Art had no more worlds then One. And when he saw that he through all had past, He dy'd, lest he should Idle grow at last. On the Death of Mr. Jordan, Second Master at Westminster School. Hence, and make room for me, all you who come Onely to read the Epitaph on this Tombe. Here lies the Master of my tender years, The Guardian of my Parents Hope and Fears, Whose Government ne'r stood me in a Tear; All weeping was reserv'd to spend it here. Come hither all who his rare virtues knew, And mourn with Me: He was your Tutor too. Let's joyn our Sighes, till they fly far, and shew His native Belgia what she's now to do. The League of grief bids her with us lament; By her he was brought forth, and hither sent In payment of all Men we there had lost, And all the English Blood those wars have cost. Wisely did Nature this learn'd Man divide; His Birth was Theirs, his Death the mournful pride Of England; and t'avoid the envious strife Of other Lands, all Europe had his Life, But we in chief; our Countrey soon was grown A Debter more to Him, then He to'his Own. He pluckt from youth the follies and the crimes, And built up Men against the future times, For deeds of Age are in their Causes then, And though he taught but Boys, he made the Men. Hence 'twas a Master in those ancient dayes When men sought Knowledge first, and by it Praise, Was a thing full of Reverence, Profit, Fame; Father it self was but a Second Name. He scorn'd the profit; his Instructions all Were like the Science, Free and Liberal. He deserv'd Honors, but despis'd them too As much as those who have them, others do. He knew not that which Complement they call; Could Flatter none, but Himself least of all. So true, so faithful, and so just as he, Was nought on earth, but his own Memorie. His Memory, where all things written were As sure and fixt as in Fates Books they are. Thus he in Arts so vast a treasure gain'd, Whilst still the Use came in, and Stock remain'd. And having purchas'd all that man can know, He labor'd with't to enrich others now. Did thus a new, and harder task sustain, Like those that work in Mines for others gain. He, though more nobly, had much more to do, To search the Vein, dig, purge, and mint it too. Though my Excuse would be, I must confess, Much better had his Diligenc[e] been less. But if a Muse hereafter smile on me, And say, Be thou a Poet, men shall see That none could a more grateful Scholar have; For what I ow'd his Life, I'll pay his Grave. On his Majesties Return out of Scotland. 1 Welcome, great Sir, with all the joy that's due To the return of Peace and You. Two greatest Blessings which this age can know; For that to Thee, for Thee to Heav'n we ow. Others by War their Conquests gain, You like a God your ends obtain. Who when rude Chaos for his help did call, Spoke but the Word, and sweetly Order'd all. 2 This happy Concord in no Blood is writ, None can grudge heav'n full thanks for it. No Mothers here lament their Childrens fate, And like the Peace, but think it comes too late. No Widows hear the jocond Bells, And take them for their Husbands Knells. No Drop of Blood is spilt which might be said To mark our joyful Holiday with Red. 3 'Twas only Heav'n could work this wondrous thing, And onely work't by such a King. Again the Northern Hindes may sing and plow, And fear no harm but from the weather now. Again may Tradesmen love their pain By knowing now for whom they gain. The Armour now may be hung up to sight, And onely in their Halls the Children fright. 4 The gain of Civil Wars will not allow Bay to the Conquerors Brow. At such a Game what fool would venture in, Where one must lose, yet neither side can win? How justly would our Neighbours smile At these mad quarrels of our Isle Sweld with proud hopes to snatch the whole away, Whilst we Bet all, and yet for nothing Play? 5 How was the silver Tine frighted before, And durst not kiss the armed shore? His waters ran more swiftly then they use, And hasted to the Sea to tell the News. The Sea it self, how rough so ere Could scarce believe such fury here. How could the Scots and we be Enemies grown? That, and its Master Charls had made us One. 6 No Blood so loud as that of Civil War; It calls for Dangers from afar. Let's rather go, and seek out Them, and Fame; Thus our Fore-fathers got, thus left a Name. All their rich blood was spent with gains, But that which swells their Childrens Veins. Why sit we still, our Spir'its wrapt up in Lead? Not like them whilst they Liv'd, but now they're Dd? 7 This noise at home was but Fates policie To raise our Spir'its more high. So a bold Lyon ere he seeks his prey, Lashes his sides, and roars, and then away. How would the German Eagle fear, To see a new Gustavus there? How would it shake, though as 'twas wont to do For Jove of old, it now bore Thunder too! 8 Sure there are actions of this height and praise Destin'd to Charls his days. What will the Triumphs of his Battels be, Whose very Peace it self is Victorie? When Heav'n bestows the best of Kings, It bids us think of mighty things. His Valour, Wisdom, Offspring speak no less; And we the Prophets Sons, write not by Guess. On the Death of Sir Anthony Vandike, The famous Painter. Vandike is Dead; but what Bold Muse shall dare (Though Poets in that word with Painters share) T'express her sadness? Po'esie must become An Art, like Painting here, an Art that's Dumb. Let's all our solemn grief in silence keep, Like some sad Picture which he made to weep, Or those who saw't, for none his works could view Unmov'd with the same Passions which he drew. His pieces so with their live Objects strive, That both or Pictures seem, or both Alive. Nature her self amaz'd, does doubting stand, Which is her own, and which the Painters Hand, And does attempt the like with less success, When her own work in Twins she would express. His All-resembling Pencil did out-pass The mimick Imag'ry of Looking-glass. Nor was his Life less perfect then his Art, Nor was his Hand less erring then his Heart. There was no false, or fading Colour there, The Figures sweet and well proportion'd were. Most other men, set next to him in view, Appear'd more shadows then the Men he drew. Thus still he liv'd till heav'n did for him call, Where reverent Luke salutes him first of all: Where he beholds new sights, divinely faire; And could almost wish for his Pencil there; Did he not gladly see how all things shine, Wondrously painted in the Mind Divine, Whilst he for ever ravisht with the show Scorns his own Art which we admire below. Onely his beauteous Lady still he loves; (The love of heav'nly Objects Heav'n improves) He sees bright Angels in pure beams appear, And thinks on her he left so like them here. And you, fair Widow, who stay here alive, Since he so much rejoyces, cease to grieve. Your joys and griefs were wont the same to be; Begin not now, blest Pair, to Disagree. No wonder Death mov'd not his gen'erous mind. You, and a new born You, he left behind. Even Fate exprest his love to his dear Wife, And let him end your Picture with his Life. Prometheus ill-painted. How wretched does Promethe'us state appear, Whilst he his Second Mis'ery suffers here! Draw him no more, lest as he tortur'd stands, He blame great Joves less then the Painters hands. It would the Vulturs cruelty outgoe, If once again his Liver thus should grow. Pity him Jove, and his bold Theft allow, The Flames he once stole from thee grant him now. ODE. 1 Here's to thee Dick; this whining Love despise; Pledge me, my Friend, and drink till thou be'st wise. It sparkles brighter far then she: 'Tis pure, and right without deceit; And such no woman ere will be: No; they are all Sophisticate. 2 With all thy servile pains what canst thou win, But an ill-favor'd, and uncleanly Sin? A thing so vile, and so short-liv'd, That Venus Joys as well as she With reason may be said to be From the neglected Foam deriv'd. 3 Whom would that painted toy a Beauty move, Whom would it ere perswade to court and love, Could he a womans Heart have seen, (But, oh, no Light does thither come) And view'd her perfectly within, When he lay shut up in her womb? 4 Follies they have so numberless in store, That only he who loves them can have more. Neither their Sighs nor Tears are true; Those idlely blow, these idlely fall, Nothing like to ours at all. But Sighs and Tears have Sexes too. 5 Here's to thee again; thy senseless sorrows drown'd; Let the Glass walk, till all things too go round; Again; till these Two Lights be Four; No error here can dangerous prove; Thy Passion, Man, deceiv'd thee more; None Double see like Men in Love. Friendship in Absence. 1 When chance or cruel business parts us two, What do our Souls I wonder do? Whilst sleep does our dull Bodies tie Methinks, at home they should not stay, Content with Dreams, but boldly flie Abroad, and meet each other half the way. 2 Sure they do meet, enjoy each other there, And mix I know not How, nor Where. Their friendly Lights together twine, Though we perceive't not to be so, Like loving Stars which oft combine, Yet not themselves their own Conjunctions know. 3 'Twere an ill World, I'll swear, for every friend, If Distance could their Union end But Love it self does far advance Above the power of Time and Space, It scorns such outward Circumstance, His Time's for ever, every where his Place. 4 I'am there with Thee, yet here with Me thou art, Lodg'd in each others heart. Miracles cease not yet in Love, When he his mighty Power will try Absence it self does Bounteous prove, And strangely ev'n our Presence Multiply. 5 Pure is the flame of Friendship, and divine Like that which in Heav'ns Sun does shine: He in the upper ayr and sky Does no effects of Heat bestow, But as his beams the farther fly He begets Warmth, Life, Beauty here below. 6 Friendship is less apparent when too nigh, Like Objects, if they touch the Eye. Less Meritorious then is Love, For when we Friends together see So much, so much Both One do prove, That their Love then seems but Self-love to be. 7 Each day think on me, and each day I shall For thee make Hours Canonical. By every Wind that comes this way, Send me at least a sigh or two, Such and so many I'll repay As shall themselves make Winds to get to you. 8 A thousand pretty wayes we'll think upon To mock our Separation. Alas, ten thousand will not do; My heart will thus no longer stay, No longer 'twill be kept from you, But knocks against the Breast to get away. 9 And when no Art affords me help or ease, I seek with verse my griefs t'appease. Just as a Bird that flies about And beats it self against the Cage, Finding at last no passage out It sits, and sings, and so orecomes its rage. To the Bishop of Lincoln, Upon his Enlargement out of the Tower. Pardon, my Lord, that I am come so late T'express my joy for your return of Fate. So when injurious Chance did you deprive Of Liberty, at first I could not grieve; My thoughts a while, like you, Imprison'd lay; Great Joys as well as Sorrows make a Stay; They hinder one another in the Crowd, And none are heard, whilst all would speak aloud. Should every mans officious gladness hast, And be afraid to shew it self the last; The throng of Gratulations now would be Another Loss to you of Libertie. When of your freedom men the news did hear Where it was wisht for, that is every where, 'Twas like the Speech which from your Lips does fall, As soon as it was heard it ravisht all. So Eloquence Tully did from exile come; Thus long'd for he return'd, and cherisht Rome, Which could no more his Tongue and Counsels miss; Rome, the Worlds head, was nothing without His. Wrong to those sacred Ashes I should do, Should I compare any to Him but You; You to whom Art and Nature did dispence The Consulship of Wit and Eloquence. Nor did your fate differ from his at all Because the doom of Exile was his fall, For the whole World without a native home Is nothing but a Pris'on of larger roome. But like a melting Woman suffer'd He, He who before out-did Humanitie. Nor could his Spi'rit constant and stedfast prove, Whose Art t'had been, and greatest end to Move. You put ill Fortune in so good a dress That it out-shone other mens Happiness, Had your Prosper'ity always clearly gon As your high Merits would have led it on, You'had Half been lost, and an Example then But for the Happy, the least part of men. Your very sufferings did so graceful shew, That some straight envy'd your Affliction too. For a clear Conscience and Heroick Mind In Ills their Business and their Glory find. So though less worthy stones are drown'd in night, The faithful Diamond keeps his native Light, And is oblig'd to Darkness for a ray That would be more opprest then helpt by Day. Your Soul then most shew'd her unconquer'd power, Was stronger and more armed then the Tower. Sure unkinde fate will tempt your Spi'rit no more, Sh'has try'd her Weakness and your Strength before. To'oppose him still who once has Conquer'd so, Were now to be your Rebel, not your Foe. Fortune henceforth will more of Provi'dence have, And rather be your Friend, then be your Slave. To a Lady who made Posies for Rings. 1 I little thought the time would ever bee, That I should Wit in Dwarfish Posies see. As all Words in Few Letters live, Thou to few Words all Sense dost give. 'Twas Nature taught you this rare art In such a Little Much to shew, Who all the good she did impart To Womankind Epitomiz'd in you. 2 If as the Ancients did not doubt to sing, The turning Years be well compar'd to a Ring, We'll write what ere from you we hear, For that's the Posie of the Year. This difference onely will remain, That Time his former face does shew Winding into himself again, But your unweari'd Wit is always New. 3 'Tis said that Conju'rers have an Art found out To carry Spi'rits confin'd in Rings about. The wonder now will less appear When we behold your Magick here. You by your Rings do Pris'ners take, And chain them with your mystick Spells, And the strong Witchcraft full to make, Love, the great Dev'il, charm'd to those Circles dwells. 4 They who above do various Circles finde, Say, like a Ring th' Æquator Heav'n does bind. When Heaven shall be adorn'd by thee (Which then more Heav'n then 'tis will be) 'Tis thou must write the Posie there, For it wanteth one as yet, Though the Sun pass through't twice a year, The Sun who is esteem'd the God of Wit. 5 Happy the Hands which wear thy sacred Rings, They'll teach those Hands to write mysterious things. Let other Rings, with Jewels bright, Cast around their costly light, Let them want no noble Stone By Nature rich, and Art refin'd, Yet shall thy Rings give place to none, But onely that which must thy Mariage bind. Prologue to the Guardian Before the Prince. Who says the Times do Learning disallow? 'Tis false; 'twas never Honor'd so as Now. When you appear, Great Prince, our Night is done; You are our Morning Star, and shall be'our Sun. But our Scene's London now; and by the rout We perish, if the Round-heads be about. For now no ornament the Head must wear, No Bays, no Mitre, not so much as Hair. How can a Play pass safely, when ye know Cheapside Cross falls for making but a Show? Our onely Hope is this, that it may be A Play may pass too, made Extempore. Though other Arts poor and neglected grow, They'l admit Po'esie which was always so. But we contemn the fury of these days, And scorn no less their Censure then their Praise. Our Muse, blest Prince, does onely'on you relie; Would gladly Live, but not refuse to Dye. Accept our hasty zeal; a thing that's play'd Ere't is a Play, and Acted ere'tis Made. Our Ign'orance, but our Duty too we show; I would all Ignorant People would do so! At other Times expect our Wit or Art; This Comedy is Acted by the Heart. The Epilogue. The Play, great Sir, is done; yet needs must fear, Though you brought all your Fathers Mercies here, It may offend your Highness, and we'have now Three hours done Treason here for ought we know. But power your grace can above Nature give, It can give power to make Abortives Live. In which if our bold wishes should be crost, 'Tis but the Life of one poor week t'has lost; Though it should fall beneath your mortal scorn, Scarce could it Dye more quickly then 'twas Born. On the Death of Mr. William Hervey. Immodicis brevis est ætas, &amp; rara Senectus. Mart. 1 It was a dismal, and a fearful night, Scarce could the Morn drive on th'unwilling Light, When Sleep, Deaths Image, left my troubled brest, By something liker Death possest. My eyes with Tears did uncommanded flow, And on my Soul hung the dull weight Of some Intolerable Fate. What Bell was that? Ah me! Too much I know. 2 My sweet Companion, and my gentle Peere, Why hast thou left me thus unkindly here, Thy end for ever, and my Life to moan; O thou hast left me all alone! Thy Soul and Body when Deaths Agonie Besieg'd around thy noble heart, Did not with more reluctance part Then I, my dearest Friend, do part from Thee. 3 My dearest Friend, would I had dy'd for thee! Life and this World henceforth will tedious bee. Nor shall I know hereafter what to do If once my Griefs prove tedious too. Silent and sad I walk about all day, As sullen Ghosts stalk speechless by Where their hid Treasures ly; Alas, my Treasure's gone, why do I stay? 4 He was my Friend, the truest Friend on earth; A strong and mighty Influence joyn'd our Birth. Nor did we envy the most sounding Name By Friendship giv'n of old to Fame. None but his Brethren he, and Sisters knew, Whom the kind youth preferr'd to Me; And ev'n in that we did agree, For much above my self I lov'd them too. 5 Say, for you saw us, ye immortal Lights, How oft unweari'd have we spent the Nights? Till the Ledœan Stars so fam'd for Love, Wondred at us from above. We spent them not in toys, in lusts, or wine; But search of deep Philosophy, Wit, Eloquence, and Poetry, Arts which I lov'd, for they, my Friend, were Thine. 6 Ye fields of Cambridge, our dear Cambridge, say, Have ye not seen us walking every day? Was there a Tree about which did not know The Love betwixt us two? Henceforth, ye gentle Trees, for ever fade; Or your sad branches thicker joyn, And into darksome shades combine, Dark as the Grave wherein my Friend is laid. 7 Henceforth no learned Youths beneath you sing, Till all the tuneful Birds to'your boughs they bring; No tuneful Birds play with their wonted chear, And call the learned Youths to hear, No whistling Winds through the glad branches fly, But all with sad solemnitie, Mute and unmoved be, Mute as the Grave wherein my Friend does ly. 8 To him my Muse made haste with every strain Whilst it was new, and warm yet from the Brain. He lov'd my worthless Rhimes, and like a Friend Would find out something to commend. Hence now, my Muse, thou canst not me delight; Be this my latest verse With which I now adorn his Herse, And this my Grief, without thy help shall write. 9 Had I a wreath of Bays about my brow, I should contemn that flourishing honor now, Condemn it to the Fire, and joy to hear It rage and crackle there. Instead of Bays, crown with sad Cypress me; Cypress which Tombs does beautifie; Not Phœbus griev'd so much as I For him, who first was made that mournful Tree. 10 Large was his Soul; as large a Soul as ere Submitted to inform a Body here. High as the Place 'twas shortly'in Heav'n to have, But low, and humble as his Grave. So high that all the Virtues there did come As to their chiefest seat Conspicuous, and great; So low that for Me too it made a room. 11 He scorn'd this busie world below, and all That we, Mistaken Mortals, Pleasure call; Was fill'd with inn'ocent Gallantry and Truth, Triumphant ore the sins of Youth. He like the Stars, to which he now is gone, That shine with beams like Flame, Yet burn not with the same, Had all the Light of Youth, of the Fire none. 12 Knowledge he only sought, and so soon caught, As if for him Knowledge had rather sought. Nor did more Learning ever crowded lie In such a short Mortalitie. When ere the skilful Youth discourst or writ, Still did the Notions throng About his eloquent Tongue, Nor could his Ink flow faster then his Wit. 13 So strong a Wit did Nature to him frame, As all things but his Judgement overcame; His Judgement like the heav'nly Moon did show, Temp'ring that mighty Sea below. Oh had he liv'd in Learnings World, what bound Would have been able to controul His over-powering Soul? We'have lost in him Arts that not yet are found. 14 His Mirth was the pure Spirits of various Wit, Yet never did his God or Friends forget. And when deep talk and wisdom came in view, Retir'd and gave to them their due. For the rich help of Books he always took, Though his own searching mind before Was so with Notions written ore As if wise Nature had made that her Book. 15 So many Virtues joyn'd in him, as we Can scarce pick here and there in Historie. More then old Writers Practice ere could reach, As much as they could ever teach. These did Religion, Queen of Virtues sway, And all their sacred Motions steare, Just like the First and Highest Sphere Which wheels about, and turns all Heav'n one way. 16 With as much Zeal, Devotion, Pietie, He always Liv'd, as other Saints do Dye. Still with his soul severe account he kept, Weeping all Debts out ere he slept. Then down in peace and innocence he lay, Like the Suns laborious light, Which still in Water sets at Night, Unsullied with his Journey of the Day. 17 Wondrous young Man, why wert thou made so good, To be snatcht hence ere better understood? Snatcht before half of thee enough was seen! Thou Ripe, and yet thy Life but Green! Nor could thy Friends take their last sad Farewel, But Danger and Infectious Death Malitiously seiz'd on that Breath Where Life, Spirit, Pleasure always us'd to dwell. 18 But happy Thou, ta'ne from this frantick age, Where Igno'rance and Hypocrisie does rage! A fitter time for Heav'n no soul ere chose, The place now onely free from those. There 'mong the Blest thou dost for ever shine, And wheresoere thou casts thy view Upon that white and radiant crew, See'st not a Soul cloath'd with more Light then Thine. 19 And if the glorious Saints cease not to know Their wretched Friends who fight with Life below; Thy Flame to Me does still the same abide, Onely more pure and rarifi'd. There whilst immortal Hymns thou dost reherse, Thou dost with holy pity see Our dull and earthly Poesie, Where Grief and Mis'ery can be join'd with Verse. ODE. In imitation of Horaces Ode. Quis multâ gracilis te puer in rosâ Perfusus, &amp;c. Lib. 1. Od. 5. 1 To whom now Pyrrha, art thou kind? To what heart-ravisht Lover, Dost thou thy golden locks unbind, Thy hidden sweets discover, And with large bounty open set All the bright stores of thy rich Cabinet? 2 Ah simple Youth, how oft will he Of thy chang'd Faith complain? And his own Fortunes find to be So airy and so vain, Of so Cameleon-like an hew; That still their colour changes with it too? 3 How oft, alas, will he admire The blackness of the Skies? Trembling to hear the Winds sound higher, And see the billows rise; Poor unexperienc'ed He Who ne're, alas, before had been at Sea! 4 He'enjoyes thy calmy Sun-shine now, And no breath stirring hears, In the clear heaven of thy brow, No smallest Cloud appears. He sees thee gentle, fair, and gay, And trusts the faithless April of thy May. 5 Unhappy! thrice unhappy He, T' whom Thou untry'ed dost shine! But there's no danger now for Me, Since o're Loretto's Shrine In witness of the Shipwrack past My consecrated Vessel hangs at last. In imitation of Martials Epigram. Si tecum mihi chare Martialis, &amp;c. L. 5. Ep. 21. If, dearest Friend, it my good Fate might be T' enjoy at once a quiet Life and Thee; If we for Happiness could leisure find, And wandring Time into a Method bind, We should not sure the Great Mens favour need, Nor on long Hopes, the Courts thin Diet, feed. We should not Patience find daily to hear, The Calumnies, and Flatteries spoken there. We should not the Lords Tables humbly use, Or talk in Ladies Chambers Love and News; But Books, and wise Discourse, Gardens and Fields, And all the joys that unmixt Nature yields. Thick Summer shades where Winter still does ly, Bright Winter Fires that Summers part supply. Sleep not controll'd by Cares, confin'd to Night, Or bound in any rule but Appetite. Free, but not savage or ungracious Mirth, Rich Wines to give it quick and easie birth. A few Companions, which our selves should chuse, A Gentle Mistress, and a Gentler Muse. Such, dearest Friend, such without doubt should be Our Place, our Business, and our Companie. Now to Himself, alas, does neither Live, But sees good Suns, of which we are to give A strict account, set and march thick away; Knows a man how to Live, and does he stay? The Chronicle. A Ballad. 1 Margarita first possest, If I remember well, my brest, Margarita first of all; But when a while the wanton Maid With my restless Heart had plaid, Martha took the flying Ball. 2 Martha soon did it resign To the beauteous Catharine. Beauteous Catharine gave place (Though loth and angry she to part With the possession of my Heart) To Elisa's conqu'ering face. 3 Elisa till this Hour might reign Had she not Evil Counsels ta'ne. Fundamental Laws she broke, And still new Favorites she chose, Till up in Arms my Passions rose, And cast away her yoke. 4 Mary then and gentle Ann Both [t]o reign at once began. Alternately they sway'd, And sometimes Mary was the Fair, And sometimes Ann the Crown did wear, And sometimes Both I' obey'd. 5 Another Mary then arose And did rigorous Laws impose. A mighty Tyrant she! Long, alas, should I have been Under that Iron-Scepter'd Queen, Had not Rebecca set me free. 6 When fair Rebecca set me free, 'Twas then a golden Time with me. But soon those pleasures fled, For the gracious Princess dy'd In her Youth and Beauties pride, And Judith reigned in her sted. 7 One Month, three Days, and half an Hour Judith held the Soveraign Power. Wondrous beautiful her Face, But so weak and small her Wit, That she to govern was unfit, And so Susanna took her place. 8 But when Isabella came Arm'd with a resistless flame And th' Artillery of her Eye; Whilst she proudly marcht about Greater Conquests to find out, She beat out Susan by the By. 9 But in her place I then obey'd Black-ey'd Besse, her Viceroy-Maid, To whom ensu'd a Vacancy. Thousand worse Passions then possest The Interregnum of my brest. Bless me from such an Anarchy! 10 Gentle Henriette than And a third Mary next began, Then Jone, and Jane, and Audria. And then a pretty Thomasine, And then another Katharine, And then a long Et cætera. 11 But should I now to you relate, The strength and riches of their state, The Powder, Patches, and the Pins, The Ribbans, Jewels, and the Rings, The Lace, the Paint, and warlike things That make up all their Magazins: 12 If I should tell the politick Arts To take and keep mens hearts, The Letters, Embassies, and Spies, The Frowns, and Smiles, and Flatteries, The Quarrels, Tears, and Perjuries, Numberless, Nameless Mysteries! 13 And all the Little Lime-twigs laid By Matchavil the Waiting-Maid; I more voluminous should grow (Chiefly if I like them should tell All Change of Weathers that befell) Then Holinshead or Stow. 14 But I will briefer with them be, Since few of them were long with Me. An higher and a nobler strain My present Emperess does claim, Heleonora, First o'th' Name; Whom God grant long to reign! To Sir William Davenant. Upon his two first Books of Gondibert, finished before his voyage to America. Methinks Heroick Poesie till now Like some fantastick Fairy Land did show, Gods, Devils, Nymphs, Witches and Gyants race, And all but Man in Mans chief work had place. Thou like some worthy Knight with sacred Arms Dost drive the Monsters thence, and end the Charms. Instead of those dost Men and Manners plant, The things which that rich Soil did chiefly want. Yet ev'en thy Mortals do their Gods excell, Taught by thy Muse to Fight and Love so well. By fatal hands whilst present Empires fall, Thine from the Grave past Monarchies recall. So much more thanks from humane kind does merit The Poets Fury, then the Zelots Spirit. And from the Grave thou mak'est this Empire rise, Not like some dreadful Ghost t'affright our Eyes, But with more Luster and triumphant state, Then when it crown'd at proud Verona sate. So will our God rebuild mans perisht frame, And raise him up much Better, yet the same. So God-like Poets do past things reherse, Not change, but Heighten Nature by their Verse. With shame, methinks, great Italy must see Her Conqu'erors rais'ed to Life again by Thee. Rais'd by such pow'erful Verse, that ancient Rome May blush no less to see her Wit o'recome. Some men their Fancies like their Faith derive, And think all Ill but that which Rome does give. The Marks of Old and Catholick would find, To the same Chair would Truth and Fiction bind. Thou in those beaten pathes disdain'st to tred, And scorn'st to Live by robbing of the Dead. Since Time does all things change, thou think'st not fit This latter Age should see all New but Wit. Thy Fancy like a Flame its way does make, And leave bright Tracks for following Pens to take. Sure 'twas this noble boldness of the Muse Did thy desire to seek new Worlds infuse, And ne're did Heav'n so much a Voyage bless, If thou canst Plant but there with like success. An Answer to a Copy of Verses sent me to Jersey. As to a Northern People (whom the Sun Uses just as the Romish Church has done Her Prophane Laity, and does assign Bread only both to serve for Bread and Wine) A rich Canary Fleet welcome arrives; Such comfort to us here your Letter gives, Fraught with brisk racy Verses, in which we The Soil from whence they came, tast, smell, and see: Such is your Present to'us; for you must know, Sir, that Verse does not in this Island grow No more then Sack; One lately did not fear (Without the Muses leave) to plant it here. But it produc'd such base, rough, crabbed, hedge Rhymes, as ev'en set the hearers Ears on Edge. Written by ? Esquire, the Year of our Lord six hundred thirty three. Brave Jersey Muse! and he's for this high stile Call'd to this day the Homer of the Isle. Alas, to men here no Words less hard be To Rhime with, then The name of one of the Castles in Jersey. Mount Orgueil is to me. Mount Orgueil, which in scorn o'th' Muses law With no yoke-fellow Word will daign to draw. Stubborn Mount Orgueil! 'tis a work to make it Come into Rhime, more hard then 'twere to take it. Alas, to bring your Tropes and Figures here, Strange as to bring Camels and Ele'phants were. And Metaphor is so unknown a thing, 'Twould need the Preface of, God save the King. Yet this I'll say for th' honor of the place, That by Gods extraordinary Grace (Which shows the people'have judgment, if not Wit) The land is undefil'd with Clinches yet. Which in my poor opinion, I confess, Is a most sing'ular blessing, and no less Then Irelands wanting Spiders. And so far From th' Actual Sin of Bombast too they are, (That other Crying Sin o'th' English Muse) That even Satan himself can accuse None here (no not so much as the Divines) For th' Motus primò primi to Strong Lines. Well, since the soil then does not natu'rally bear Verse, who (a Devil) should import it here? For that to me would seem as strange a thing As who did first Wild Beasts into 'Islands bring. Unless you think that it might taken be As Green did Gond'ibert, in a Prize at Sea. But that's a Fortune falls not every day; 'Tis true Green was made by it; for they say The Parl'ament did a noble bounty do, And gave him the whole Prize, their Tenths and Fifteens too. The Tree of Knowledge. That there is no Knowledge. Against the Dogmatists. 1 The sacred Tree midst the fair Orchard grew; The Phœnix Truth did on it rest, And built his perfum'd Nest. That right Porphyrian Tree which did true Logick shew, Each Leaf did learned Notions give, And th' Apples were Demonstrative. So clear their Colour and divine, The very shade they cast did other Lights out-shine. 2 Taste not, said God; 'tis mine and Angels meat; A certain Death does sit Like an ill Worm i'th' Core of it. Ye cannot Know and Live, nor Live or Know and Eat. Thus spoke God, yet Man did go Ignorantly on to Know; Grew so more blind, and she Who tempted him to this, grew yet more Blind then He. 3 The onely Science Man by this did get, Was but to know he nothing Knew: He straight his Nakedness did view, His ign'orant poor estate, and was asham'd of it. Yet searches Probabilities, And Rhetorick, and Fallacies, And seeks by useless pride With slight and withering Leaves that Nakedness to hide. 4 Henceforth, said God, the wretched Sons of earth Shall sweat for Food in vain That will not long sustain, And bring with Labor forth each fond Abortive Birth. That Serpent too, their Pride, Which aims at things deny'd, That learn'd and eloquent Lust Instead of Mounting high, shall creep upon the Dust. Reason. The use of it in Divine Matters. 1 Some blind themselves, 'cause possibly they may Be led by others a right way; They build on Sands, which if unmov'd they find, 'Tis but because there was no Wind. Less hard 'tis, not to Erre our selves, then know If our Fore-fathers err'd or no. When we trust Men concerning God, we then Trust not God concerning Men. 2 Visions and Inspirations some expect Their course here to direct, Like senseless Chymists their own wealth destroy, Imaginary Gold t'enjoy. So Stars appear to drop to us from skie, And gild the passage as they fly: But when they fall, and meet th'opposing ground, What but a sordid Slime is found? 3 Sometimes their Fancies they 'bove Reason set, And Fast, that they may Dream of meat. Sometimes ill Spi'rits their sickly souls delude, And Bastard-Forms obtrude. So Endors wretched Sorceress, although She Saul through his disguise did know, Yet when the Dev'il comes up disguis'd, she cries, Behold, the Gods arise. 4 In vain, alas, these outward Hopes are try'd; Reason within's our onely Guide. Reason, which (God be prais'd!) still Walks, for all It's old Original Fall. And since it self the boundless Godhead joyn'd With a Reasonable Mind, It plainly shows that Mysteries Divine May with our Reason joyn. 5 The Holy Book, like the eighth Sphere, does shine With thousand Lights of Truth Divine. So numberless the Stars, that to the Eye, It makes but all one Galaxie. Yet Reason must assist too, for in Seas So vast and dangerous as these, Our course by Stars above we cannot know, Without the Compass too below. 6 Though Reason cannot through Faiths Myst'eries see, It sees that There and such they be; Leads to Heav'ens Door, and there does humbly keep, And there through Chinks and Key-holes peep. Though it, like Moses, by a sad command Must not come in to th' Holy Land, Yet thither it infallibly does Guid, And from afar 'tis all Descry'd. On the Death of Mr. Crashaw. Poet and Saint! to thee alone are given The two most sacred Names of Earth and Heaven. The hard and rarest Union which can be Next that of Godhead with Humanitie. Long did the Muses banisht Slaves abide, And built vain Pyramids to mortal pride; Like Moses Thou (though Spells and Charms withstand) Hast brought them nobly home back to their Holy Land. Ah wretched We, Poets of Earth! but Thou Wert Living the same Poet which thou'rt Now. Whilst Angels sing to thee their ayres divine, And joy in an applause so great as thine. Equal society with them to hold, Thou need'st not make new Songs, but say the Old. And they (kind Spirits!) shall all rejoyce to see How little less then They, Exalted Man may be. Still the old Heathen Gods in Numbers dwell, The Heav'enliest thing on Earth still keeps up Hell. Nor have we yet quite purg'd the Christian Land; Still Idols here, like Calves at Bethel stand. And though Pans Death long since all Oracles broke, Yet still in Rhyme the Fiend Apollo spoke: Nay with the worst of Heathen dotage We (Vain men!) the Monster Woman Deifie; Find Stars, and tye our Fates there in a Face, And Paradise in them by whom we lost it, place. What different faults corrupt our Muses thus? Wanton as Girles, as old Wives, Fabulous! Thy spotless Muse, like Mary, did contain The boundless Godhead; she did well disdain That her eternal Verse employ'd should be On a less subject then Eternitie; And for a sacred Mistress scorn'd to take, But her whom God himself scorn'd not his Spouse to make. It (in a kind) her Miracle did do; A fruitful Mother was, and Virgin too. M. Crashaw died of a Fever at Loretto, being newly chosen Canon of that Church. How well (blest Swan) did Fate contrive thy death; And made thee render up thy tuneful breath In thy great Mistress Arms? thou most divine And richest Off'ering of Loretto's Shrine! Where like some holy Sacrifice t'expire, A Fever burns thee, and Love lights the Fire. Angels (they say) brought the fam'ed Chappel there, And bore the sacred Load in Triumph through the air. 'Tis surer much they brought thee there, and They, And Thou, their charge, went singing all the way. Pardon, my Mother Church, if I consent That Angels led him when from thee he went, For even in Error sure no Danger is When joyn'd with so much Piety as His. Ah, mighty God, with shame I speak't, and grief, Ah that our greatest Faults were in Belief! And our weak Reason were ev'en weaker yet, Rather then thus our Wills too strong for it. His Faith perhaps in some nice Tenents might Be wrong; his Life, I'm sure, was in the right. And I my self a Catholick will be, So far at least, great Saint, to Pray to thee. Hail, Bard Triumphant! and some care bestow On us, the Poets Militant Below! Oppos'ed by our old En'emy, adverse Chance, Attacqu'ed by Envy, and by Ignorance, Enchain'd by Beauty, tortur'd by Desires, Expos'd by Tyrant-Love to savage Beasts and Fires. Thou from low earth in nobler Flames didst rise, And like Elijah, mount Alive the skies. Elisha-like (but with a wish much less, More fit thy Greatness, and my Littleness) Lo here I beg (I whom thou once didst prove So humble to Esteem, so Good to Love) Not that thy Spirit might on me Doubled be, I ask but Half thy mighty Spirit for Me. And when my Muse soars with so strong a Wing, 'Twill learn of things Divine, and first of Thee to sing. Anacreontiques: OR, Some Copies of Verses Translated Paraphrastically out of Anacreon. I. Love. I'll sing of Heroes, and of Kings; In mighty Numbers, mighty things, Begin, my Muse; but lo, the strings To my great Song rebellious prove; The strings will sound of nought but Love. I broke them all, and put on new; 'Tis this or nothing sure will do. These sure (said I) will me obey; These sure Heroick Notes will play. Straight I began with thundring Jove, And all th'immortal Pow'ers, but Love, Love smil'd, and from my'enfeebled Lyre Came gentle airs, such as inspire Melting love, soft desire. Farewel then Heroes, farewel Kings, And mighty Numbers, mighty Things; Love tunes my Heart just to my strings. II Drinking. The thirsty Earth soaks up the Rain, And drinks, and gapes for drink again. The Plants such in the Earth, and are With constant drinking fresh and fair. The Sea it self, which one would think Should have but little need of Drink, Drinks ten thousand Rivers up, So fill'd that they or'eflow the Cup. The busie Sun (and one would guess By's drunken fiery face no less) Drinks up the Sea, and when h'as done, The Moon and Stars drink up the Sun. They dirnk and dance by their own light, They drink and revel all the night. Nothing in Nature's Sober found, But an eternal Health goes round. Fill up the Bowl then, fill it high, Fill all the Glasses there, for why Should every creature drink but I, Why, Man of Morals, tell me why? III. Beauty. Liberal Nature did dispence To all things Arms for their defence; And some she arms with sin'ewy force, And some with swiftness in the course; Some with hard Hoofs, or forked claws, And some with Horns, or tusked jaws. And some with Scales, and some with Wings, And some with Teeth, and some with Stings. Wisdom to Man she did afford, Wisdom for Shield, and Wit for Sword. What to beauteous Woman-kind, What Arms, what Armour has she'assigne'd? Beauty is both; for with the Fair What Arms, what Armour can compare? What Steel, what Gold, or Diamond, More Impassible is found? And yet what Flame, what Lightning e're So great an Active force did bear? They are all weapon, and they dart Like Porcupines from every part. Who can, alas their strength express, Arm'd, when they themselves undress, Cap-a-pe with Nakedness? IV. The Duel. Yes, I will love then, I will love, I will not now Loves Rebel prove, Though I was once his Enemy; Though ill-advis'd and stubborn I, Did to the Combate him defy, An Helmet, Spear, and mighty shield, Like some new Ajax I did wield. Love in one hand his Bow did take, In th'other hand a Dart did shake. But yet in vain the Dart did throw, In vain he often drew the Bow. So well my Armour did resist, So oft by flight the blow I mist. But when I thought all danger past, His Quiver empty'd quite at last, Instead of Arrow, or of Dart, He shot Himself into my Heart. The Living and the Killing Arrow Ran through the skin, the Flesh, the Blood, And broke the Bones and scorcht the Marrow, No Trench or Work of Life withstood. In vain I now the Walls maintain, I set out Guards and Scouts in vain, Since th' En'emy does within remain. In vain a Breastplate now I wear, Since in my Breast the Foe I bear. In vain my Feet their swiftness try; For from the Body can they fly? V. Age. Oft am I by the Women told, Poor Anacreon thou grow'st old. Look how thy hairs are falling all; Poor Anacreon how they fall? Whether I grow old or no, By th'effects I do not know. This I know without being told, 'Tis Time to Live if I grow Old, 'Tis time short pleasures now to take, Of little Life the best to make, And manage wisely the last stake. VI. The Account. When all the Stars are by thee told, (The endless Sums of heav'nly Gold) Or when the Hairs are reckon'd all, From sickly Autumns Head that fall, Or when the drops that make the Sea, Whilst all her Sands thy Counters be; Thou then, and Thou alone maist prove Th' Arithmetician of my Love. An hundred Loves at Athens score, At Corinth write an hundred more. Fair Corinth does such Beauties bear, So few is an Escaping there. Write then at Chios seventy three; Write then at Lesbos (let me see) Write me at Lesbos ninety down, Full ninety Loves, and half a One. And next to these let me present, The fair Ionian Regiment. And next the Carian Company, Five hundred both Effectively. Three hundred more at Rhodes and Crete; Three hundred 'tis I'am sure Complete. For arms at Crete each Face does bear, And every Eye's an Archer there. Go one; this stop why dost thou make? Thou thinkst, perhaps, that I mistake. Seems this to thee too great a Summe? Why many Thousands are to come; The mighty Xerxes could not boast Such different Nations in his Host. On; for my Love, if thou be'st weary, Must find some better Secretary. I have not yet my Persian told, Nor yet my Syrian Loves enroll'd, Nor Indian, nor Arabian; Nor Cyprian Loves, nor African; Nor Scythian, nor Italian flames; There's a whole Map behind of Names. Of gentle Love i'th' temperate Zone, And cold ones in the Frigid One, Cold frozen Loves with which I pine, And parched Loves beneath the Line. VII. Gold. A Mighty pain to Love it is, And 'tis a pain that pain to miss. But of all pains the greatest pain It is to love, but love in vain. Virtue now nor noble Blood, Nor Wit by Love is understood, Gold alone does passion move, Gold Monopolizes love! A curse on her, and on the Man Who this traffick first began! A curse on him who found the Ore! A curse on him who digg'd the store! A curse on him who did refine it! A curse on him who first did coyn it! A Curse all curses else above On him, who us'd it first in Love! Gold begets in Brethren hate, Gold in Families debate; Gold does Friendships separate, Gold does Civil Wars create. These the smallest harms of it! Gold, alas, does Love beget. VIII. The Epicure. Fill the Bowl with rosie Wine, Around our temples Roses twine. And let us chearfully awhile, Like the Wine and Roses smile. Crown'd with Roses we contemn Gyge's wealthy Diadem. To day is Ours; what do we fear? To day is Ours; we have it here. Let's treat it kindly, that it may Wish, at least, with us to stay. Let's banish Business, banish Sorrow; To the Gods belongs To morrow. IX. Another. Underneath this Myrtle shade, On flowry beds supinely laid, With od'orous Oyls my head o're-flowing, And around it Roses growing, What should I do but drink away The Heat, and troubles of the Day? In this more then Kingly state, Love himself shall on me wait. Fill to me, Love, nay fill it up; And mingled cast into the Cup, Wit, and Mirth, and noble Fires, Vigorous Health, and gay Desires. The Wheel of Life no less will stay In a smooth then Rugged way. Since it equally does flee, Let the Motion pleasant be. Why do we precious Oyntments shower, Nobler wines why do we pour, Beauteous Flowers why do we spread, Upon the Mon'uments of the Dead? Nothing they but Dust can show, Or Bones that hasten to be so. Crown me with Roses whilst I Live, Now your Wines and Oyntments give. After Death I nothing crave, Let me Alive my pleasures have, All are Stoicks in the Grave. X. The Grashopper. Happy Insect, what can be In happiness compar'd to Thee? Fed with nourishment divine, The dewy Mornings gentle Wine! Nature waits upon thee still, And thy verdant Cup does fill, 'Tis fill'd where ever thou dost tread, Nature selfe's thy Ganimed. Thou dost drink, and dance, and sing; Happier then the happiest King! All the Fields which thou dost see, All the Plants belong to Thee, All that Summer Hours produce, Fertile made with early juice. Man for thee does sow and plow; Farmer He, and Land-Lord Thou! Thou does innocently joy; Nor does thy Luxury destroy; The Shepherd gladly heareth thee, More Harmonious then He. Thee Country Hindes with gladness hear, Prophet of the ripened year! Thee Phœbus loves, and does inspire; Phœbus is himself thy Sire. To thee of all things upon earth, Life is no longer then thy Mirth. Happy Insect, happy Thou, Dost neither Age, nor Winter know. But when thou'st drunk, and danc'd, and sung, Thy fill, the flowry Leaves among (Voluptuous, and Wise with all, Epicuræan Animal!) Sated with thy Summer Feast, Thou retir'est to endless Rest. XI. The Swallow. Foolish Prater, what do'st thou So early at my window do With thy tuneless Serenade? Well t'had been had Tereus made Thee as Dumb as Philomel; There his Knife had done but well. In thy undiscover'ed Nest Thou dost all the winter rest, And dreamest o're thy summer joys Free from the stormy seasons noise: Free from th'Ill thou'st done to me; Who disturbs, or seeks out Thee? Had'st thou all the charming notes Of the woods Poetick Throats, All thy art could never pay What thou'st ta'ne from me away; Cruel Bird, thou'st ta'ne away A Dream out of my arms to day, A Dream that ne're must equall'd be By all that waking Eyes may see. Thou this damage to repair, Nothing half so sweet or fair, Nothing half so good can'st bring, Though men say, Thou bring'st the Spring. ELEGIE UPON ANACREON, Who was choaked by a Grape-Stone. Spoken by the God of Love. How shall I lament thine end, My best Servant, and my Friend? Nay and, if from a Deity So much Deifi'ed as I, It sound not too profane and odd, Oh my Master, and my God! For 'tis true, most mighty Poet, (Though I like not Men should know it) I am in naked Nature less, Less by much then in thy Dress. All thy Verse is softer far Then the downy Feathers are, Of my Wings, or of my Arrows, Of my Mothers Doves, or Sparrows. Sweet as Lovers freshest kisses, Or their riper following blisses, Graceful, cleanly, smooth and round, All with Venus Girdle bound, And thy Life was all the while Kind and gentle as thy Stile. The smooth-pac'd Hours of ev'ery day Glided numerously away. Like thy Verse each Hour did pass, Sweet and short, like that it was. Some do but their Youth allow me, Just what they by Nature owe me, The time that's mine, and not their own, The certain Tribute of my Crown, When thy grow old, they grow to be Too Busie, or too wise for me. Thou wert wiser, and did'st know None too wise for Love can grow, Love was with thy Life entwin'd Close as Heat with Fire is joyn'd, A powerful Brand prescrib'd the date Of thine, like Meleagers Fate. Th' Antiperistasis of Age More enflam'd thy amorous rage, Thy silver Hairs yielded me more Then even golden curls before. Had I the power of Creation, As I have of Generation, Where I the matter must obey, And cannot work Plate out of Clay, My Creatures should be all like Thee, 'Tis Thou shouldst their Idæa be. They, like Thee, should throughly hate Bus'iness, Honor, Title, State. Other wealth thy should not know But what my Living Mines bestow; The pomp of Kings they should confess At their Crownings to be less Then a Lovers humblest guise, When at his Mistress feet he lies. Rumour they no more should mind Then Men safe-landed do the Wind, Wisdom it self they should not hear When it presumes to be Severe. Beauty alone they should admire; Nor look at Fortunes vain attire, Nor ask what Parents it can shew; With Dead or Old t'has nought to do. They should not love yet All, or Any, But very Much, and very Many. All their Life should gilded be With Mirth, and Wit, and Gayety, Well remembring, and Applying The Necessity of Dying. Their chearful Heads should always wear All that crowns the flowry year. They should always laugh, and sing, And dance, and strike th'harmonious string. Verse should from their Tongue so flow, As if it in the Mouth did grow, As swiftly answering their command, As tunes obey the artful Hand. And whilst I do thus discover Th'ingredients of a happy Lover, 'Tis, my Anacreon, for thy sake I of the Grape no mention make. Till my' Anacreon by thee fell, Cursed Plant, I lov'd thee well. And 'twas oft my wanton use To dip my Arrows in thy juice. Cursed Plant, 'tis true I see, Th'old report that goes of Thee, That with Gyants blood the Earth Stain'd and poys'ned gave thee birth, And now thou wreak'st thy ancient spight On Men in whom the Gods delight. Thy Patron Bacchus, 'tis no wonder, Was brought forth in Flames and Thunder, In rage, in quarrels, and in fights, Worse then his Tygers he delights; In all our heaven I think there be No such ill-natur'd God as He. Thou pretendest, Trayt'erous Wine, To be the Muses friend and Mine. With Love and Wit thou dost begin, False Fires, alas, to draw us in. Which, if our course we by them keep, Misguide to Madness, or to Sleep. Sleep were well; thou'hast learnt a way To Death it self now to betray. It grieves me when I see what Fate Does on the best of Mankind wait. Poets or Lovers let them be, 'Tis neither Love nor Poesie Can arm against Deaths smallest dart The Poets Head, or Lovers Heart. But when their Life in its decline, Touches th'Inevitable Line, All the Worlds Mortal to'em then, And Wine is Aconite to men. Nay in Deaths Hand the Grape-stone proves As strong as Thunder is in Joves. FINIS. THE MISTRESS: OR, SEVERAL COPIES OF LOVE-VERSES. Virg. Æn. 4. —Hæret lateri lethalis arundo. The Request. 1 I'have often wisht to love; what shall I do? Me still the cruel Boy does spare; And I a double task must bear, First to woo him, and then a Mistress too. Come at last and strike for shame; If thou art any thing besides a name. I'le think Thee else no God to be; But Poets rather Gods, who first created Thee. 2 I ask not one in whom all beauties grow, Let me but love, what e're she be, She cannot seem deform'd to me; And I would have her seem to others so. Desire takes wings and strait does fly, It stays not dully to inquire the Why. That Happy thing a Lover grown, I shall not see with others Eyes, scarce with mine own. 3 If she be coy and scorn my noble fire, If her chill heart I cannot move, Why I'le enjoy the very Love, And make a Mistress of my own Desire. Flames their most vigorous heat do hold, And purest light, if compast round with cold: So when sharp Winter means most harm, The springing Plants are by the Snow it self kept warm. 4 But do not touch my heart, and so be gone; Strike deep thy burning arrows in: Lukewarmness I account a sin, As great in Love, as in Religion. Come arm'd with flames, for I would prove All the extremities of mighty Love. Th' excess of heat is but a fable; We know the torrid Zone is now found habitable. 5 Among the Woods and Forrests thou art found, There Bores and Lyons thou dost tame; Is not my heart a nobler game? Let Venus, Men; and Beasts, Diana wound. Thou dost the Birds thy Subjects make; Thy nimble feathers do their wings o'retake: Thou all the Spring their Songs dost hear, Make me Love too, I'll sing to' thee all the year. 6 What service can mute Fishes do to Thee? Yet against them thy Dart prevails, Piercing the armour of their Scales; And still thy Sea-born Mother lives i'th' Sea. Dost thou deny onely to me The no-great privilege of Captivitie? I beg or challenge here thy Bow; Either thy pity to me, or else thine anger show. 7 Come; or I'll teach the world to scorn that Bow: I'll teach them thousand wholesome arts Both to resist and cure thy darts, More then thy skilful Ovid e're did know. Musick of sighs thou shalt not hear, Nor drink one wretched Lovers tasteful Tear: Nay, unless soon thou woundest me, My Verses shall not onely wound, but murther Thee. The Thraldome. 1 I came, I Saw, and was undone; Lightning did through my bones and marrow run; A pointed pain pierc'd deep my heart; A swift, cold trembling seiz'd on every part; My head turn'd round, nor could it bear The Poison that was enter'd there. 2 So a destroying Angels breath Blows in the Plague, and with it hasty Death. Such was the pain, did so begin To the poor wretch, when Legion entred in. Forgive me, God, I cry'd; for I Flatter'd my self I was to dye. 3 But quickly to my Cost I found, 'Twas cruel Love, not Death had made the wound: Death a more generous rage does use; Quarter to all he conquers does refuse. Whilst Love with barbarous mercy saves The vanquisht lives to make them slaves. 4 I am thy slave then; let me know, Hard Master, the great task I have to do: Who pride and scorn do undergo, In tempests and rough Seas thy Galleys row; They pant, and groan, and sigh, but find Their sighs encrease the angry wind. 5 Like an Egyptian Tyrant, some Thou weariest out, in building but a Tomb. Others with sad and tedious art, Labour i'the' Quarries of a stony Heart; Of all the works thou dost assign, To all the several slaves of thine, Employ me, mighty Love, to dig the Mine. The Given Love. 1 I'll on; for what should hinder me From Loving, and Enjoying Thee? Thou canst not those exceptions make, Which vulgar sordid Mortals take, That my Fate's too mean and low; 'Twere pity I should love thee so, If that dull cause could hinder me In Loving, and Enjoying thee. 2 It does not me a whit displease, That the rich all honours seize; That you all Titles make your own, Are Valiant, Learned, Wise alone. But if you claim o're Women too The power which over Men ye do; If you alone must Lovers be; For that, Sirs, you must pardon me. 3 Rather then lose what does so near Concern my Life and Being here, I'll some such crooked ways invent, As you, or your Fore-fathers went: I'll flatter or oppose the King, Turn Puritan, or Any Thing; I'll force my Mind to arts so new: Grow Rich, and Love as well as You. 4 But rather thus let me remain, As Man in Paradise did reign; When perfect Love did so agree With Innocence and Povertie. Adam did no Joynture give, Himself was Joynture to his Eve: Untoucht with Av'arice yet or Pride, The Rib came freely back to 'his side. 5 A curse upon the man who taught Women, that Love was to be bought; Rather dote only on your Gold; And that with greedy av'arice hold; For if Woman too submit To that, and sell her self for it, Fond Lover, you a Mistress have Of her, that's but your Fellow-slave. 6 What should those Poets mean of old That made their God to woo in Gold? Of all men sure They had no cause To bind Love to such costly Laws; And yet I scarcely blame them now; For who, alas, would not allow, That Women should such gifts receive, Could They, as He, Be what They give. 7 If thou, my Dear, Thy self shouldst prize, Alas, what value would suffize? The Spaniard could not do't, though he Should to both Indies joynture thee. Thy beauties therefore wrong will take, If thou shouldst any bargain make; To give All will befit thee well; But not at Under-Rates to sell. 8 Bestow thy Beauty then on me, Freely, as Nature gave't to Thee; 'Tis an exploded Popish thought To think that Heaven may be bought. Pray'rs, Hymns, and Praises are the way; And those my thankful Muse shall pay; Thy Body in my verse enshrin'd, Shall grow immortal as thy Mind. 9 I'll fix thy title next in fame To Sacharissas well-sung name. So faithfully will I declare What all thy wondrous beauties are, That when at the last great Assise, All Women shall together rise, Men strait shall cast their eyes on Thee And know at first that Thou art She. The Spring. 1 Though you be absent here, I needs must say The Trees as beauteous are, and flowers as gay, As ever they were wont to be; Nay the Birds rural musick too Is as melodious and free, As if they sung to pleasure you: I saw a Rose-Bud o'pe this morn; I'll swear The blushing Morning open'd not more fair. 2 How could it be so fair, and you away? How could the Trees be beauteous, Flowers so gay? Could they remember but last year, How you did Them, They you delight, The sprouting leaves which saw you here, And call'd their Fellows to the sight, Would, looking round for the same sight in vain, Creep back into their silent Barks again. 3 Where ere you walk'd trees were as reverend made, As when of old Gods dwelt in every shade. Is't possible they should not know, What loss of honor they sustain, That thus they smile and flourish now, And still their former pride retain? Dull Creatures! 'tis not without Cause that she, Who fled the God of wit, was made a Tree. 4 In ancient times sure they much wiser were, When they rejoyc'd the Thracian verse to hear; In vain did Nature bid them stay, When Orpheus had his song begun, They call'd their wondring roots away, And bad them silent to him run. How would those learned trees have followed you? You would have drawn Them, and their Poet too. 5 But who can blame them now? for, since you're gone, They're here the only Fair, and Shine alone. You did their Natural Rights invade; Where ever you did walk or sit, The thickest Boughs could make no shade, Although the Sun had granted it: The fairest Flowers could please no more, neer you, Then Painted Flowers, set next to them, could do. 6 When e're then you come hither, that shall be The time, which this to others is, to Me. The little joys which here are now, The name of Punishments do bear; When by their sight they let us know How we depriv'd of greater are. 'Tis you the best of Seasons with you bring; This is for Beasts, and that for Men the Spring. Written in Juice of Lemmon. 1 Whilst what I write I do not see, I dare thus, even to you, write Poetry. Ah foolish Muse, which do'st so high aspire, And know'st her judgment well How much it does thy power excel, Yet dar'st be read by, thy just doom, the Fire. 2 Alas, thou think'st thy self secure, Because thy form is Innocent and Pure: Like Hypocrites, which seem unspotted here; But when they sadly come to dye, And the last Fire their Truth must try, Scrauld o're like thee, and blotted they appear. 3 Go then, but reverently go, And, since thou needs must sin, confess it too: Confess't, and with humility clothe thy shame; For thou, who else must burned be An Heretick, if she pardon thee, May'st like a Martyr then enjoy the Flame. 4 But if her wisdom grow severe, And suffer not her goodness to be there; If her large mercies cruelly it restrain; Be not discourag'd, but require A more gentle Ordeal Fire, And bid her by Loves-Flames read it again. 5 Strange power of heat, thou yet dost show Like winter earth, naked, or cloath'd with Snow, But, as the quickning Sun approaching near, The Plants arise up by degrees, A sudden paint adorns the trees, And all kind Natures Characters appear. 6 So, nothing yet in Thee is seen, But when a Genial heat warms thee within, A new-born Wood of various Lines there grows; Here buds an A, and there a B, Here sprouts a V, and there a T, And all the flourishing Letters stand in Rows. 7 Still, silly Paper, thou wilt think That all this might as well be writ with Ink. Oh no; there's sense in this, and Mysterie; Thou now maist change thy Authors name, And to her Hand lay noble claim; For as She Reads, she Makes the words in Thee. 8 Yet if thine own unworthiness Will still, that thou art mine, not Hers, confess; Consume thy self with Fire before her Eyes, And so her Grace or Pity move; The Gods, though Beasts they do not Love, Yet like them when they'r burnt in Sacrifice. Inconstancy. Five years ago (says Story) I lov'd you, For which you call me most Inconstant now; Pardon me, Madam, you mistake the Man; For I am not the same that I was than; No Flesh is now the same 'twas then in Me, And that my Mind is chang'd your self may see. The same Thoughts to retain still, and Intents Were more inconstant far; for Accidents Must of all things most strangely 'Inconstant prove, If from one Subject they t'another move; My Members then, the Father members were From whence These take their birth, which now are here. If then this Body love what th' other did, 'Twere Incest; which by Nature is forbid. You might as well this Day inconstant name, Because the Weather is not still the same, That it was yesterday: or blame the Year, Cause the Spring, Flowers; and Autumn, Fruit does bear. The World's a Scene of Changes, and to be Constant, in Nature were Inconstancy; For 'twere to break the Laws her self has made: Our Substances themselves do fleet and fade; The most fixt Being still does move and fly, Swift as the wings of Time 'tis measur'd by. T'imagine then that Love should never cease (Love which is but the Ornament of these) Were quite as senseless, as to wonder why Beauty and Colour stays not when we dye. Not Fair. 'Tis very true, I thought you once as fair, As women in th'Idæa are. Whatever here seems beauteous, seem'd to be But a faint Metaphor of Thee. But then (methoughts) there something shin'd within, Which cast this Lustre o're thy skin. Nor could I chuse but count it the Suns Light, Which made this Cloud appear so bright. But since I knew thy falshood and thy pride, And all thy thousand faults beside; A very Moor (methinks) plac'd near to Thee, White, as his Teeth, would seem to be. So men (they say) by Hells delusions led, Have ta'ne a Succu'bus to their bed; Believe it fair, and themselves happy call, Till the cleft Foot discovers all: Then they start from't, half Ghosts themselves with fear; And Devil, as 'tis, it does appear. So since against my will I found Thee foul, Deform'd and crooked in thy Soul, My Reason strait did to my Senses shew, That they might be mistaken too: Nay when the world but knows how false you are, There's not a man will think you fair. Thy shape will monstrous in their fancies be, They'l call their Eyes as false as Thee. Be what thou wilt; Hate will present thee so, As Puritans do the Pope, and Papists Luther do. Platonick Love. 1 Indeed I must confess, When Souls mix 'tis an Happiness; But not compleat till Bodies too combine, And closely as our minds together join; But half of Heaven the Souls in glory tast, 'Till by Love in Heaven at last, Their Bodies too are plac't. 2 In thy immortal part Man, as well as I, thou art. But something 'tis that differs Thee and Me; And we must one even in that difference be. I Thee, both as a man, and woman prize; For a perfect Love implies Love in all Capacities. 3 Can that for true love pass, When a fair Woman courts her glass? Something unlike must in Loves likeness be, His wonder is, one, and Variety. For he, whose soul nought but a soul can move, Does a new Narcissus prove, And his own Image love. 4 That souls do beauty know, 'Tis to the Bodies help they owe; If when they know't, they strait abuse that trust, And shut the Body from't, 'tis as unjust, As if I brought my dearest Friend to see My Mistress, and at th'instant He Should steal her quite from Me. The Change. 1 Love in her Sunny Eyes does basking play; Love walks the pleasant Mazes of her Hair; Love does on both her Lips for ever stray; And sows and reaps a thousand kisses there. In all her outward parts Love's always seen; But, oh, He never went within. 2 Within Love's foes, his greatest foes abide, Malice, Inconstancy, and Pride. So the Earths face, Trees, Herbs, and Flowers do dress, With other beauties numberless: But at the Center, Darkness is, and Hell; There wicked Spirits, and there the Damned dwell. 3 With me alas, quite contrary it fares; Darkness and Death lies in my weeping eyes, Despair and Paleness in my face appears, And Grief, and Fear, Love's greatest Enemies; But, like the Persian-Tyrant, Love within Keeps his proud Court, and ne're is seen. 4 Oh take my Heart, and by that means you'll prove Within, too stor'd enough of Love: Give me but Yours, I'll by that change so thrive, That Love in all my parts shall live. So powerful is this change, it render can, My outside Woman, and your inside Man. Clad all in White. 1 Fairest thing that shines below, Why in this robe dost thou appear? Wouldst thou a white most perfect show, Thou must at all no garment wear: Thou wilt seem much whiter so, Then Winter when 'tis clad with snow. 2 'Tis not the Linnen shews so fair: Her skin shines through, and makes it bright; So clouds themselves like Suns appear, When the Sun pierces them with Light: So Lillies in a glass enclose, The Glass will seem as white as those. 3 Thou now one heap of beauty art; Nought outwards, or within is foul: Condensed beams make every part; Thy Body's Clothed like thy Soul. Thy soul, which does it self display, Like a star plac'd i'th' Milkie way. 4 Such robes the Saints departed wear, Woven all with Light divine; Such their exalted Bodies are, And with such full glory shine. But they regard not mortals pain; Men pray, I fear, to both in vain. 5 Yet seeing thee so gently pure, My hopes will needs continue still; Thou wouldst not take this garment sure, When thou hadst an intent to kill. Of Peace and yielding who would doubt, When the white Flag he sees hung out? Leaving Me, and then loving Many. So Men, who once have cast the Truth away, Forsook by God, do strange wild lusts obey; So the vain Gentiles, when they left t' adore One Deity, could not stop at thousands more. Their zeal was senseless strait, and boundless grown; They worshipt many a Beast, and many a Stone. Ah fair Apostate! couldst thou think to flee From Truth and Goodness, yet keep Unity? I reign'd alone; and my blest Self could call The Universal Monarch of her All. Mine, mine her fair East-Indies were above, Where those Suns rise that chear the world of Love; Where beauties shine like Gems of richest price; Where Coral grows, and every breath is spice: Mine too her rich West-Indies were below, Where Mines of gold and endless treasures grow. But, as, when the Pellæan Conquerour dy'd, Many small Princes did his Crown divide, So, since my Love his vanquisht world forsook, Murther'd by poysons from her falshood took, An hundred petty Kings claim each their part, And rend that glorious Empire of her Heart. My Heart discovered. Her body is so gently bright, Clear, and transparent to the sight, (Clear as fair Christal to the view, Yet soft as that, e're Stone it grew,) That through her flesh, methinks, is seen The brighter Soul that dwells within: Our eyes the subtile covering pass, And see that Lilly through its Glass. I through her Breast her Heart espy, As Souls in hearts do Souls descry, I see't with gentle Motions beat; I see Light in't, but find no Heat. Within, like Angels in the sky, A thousand guilded thoughts do fly: Thoughts of bright and noblest kind, Fair and chast, as Mother-Mind. But, oh, what other Heart is there, Which sighs and crouds to hers so neer? 'Tis all on flame, and does like fire, To that, as to its Heaven, aspire, The wounds are many in't and deep; Still does it bleed, and still does weep. Whose ever wretched heart it be, I cannot chuse but grieve to see; What pity in my Breast does raign? Methinks I feel too all its pain. So torn, and so defac'd it lies, That it could ne're be known by th' eyes; But, oh, at last I heard it grone, And knew by th' Voyce that 'twas mine own. So poor Alcione, when she saw A shipwrackt body tow'ards her draw Beat by the Waves, let fall a Tear, Which only then did Pity wear: But when the Corps on shore were cast, Which she her Husband found at last; What should the wretched Widow do? Grief chang'd her straight; away she flew, Turn'd to a Bird: and so at last shall I, Both from my Murther'd Heart, and Murth'rer fly. Answer to the Platonicks. So Angels love; so let them love for me; When I'am all soul, such shall my Love too be: Who nothing here but like a Spirit would do, In a short time (believ't) will be one too: But shall our Love do what in Beasts we see? E'ven Beasts eat too, but not so well as We. And you as justly might in thirst refuse The use of Wine, because Beasts Water use: They taste those pleasures as they do their food; Undrest they tak't, devour it raw and crude: But to us Men, Love Cooks it at his fire, And adds the poignant sawce of sharp desire. Beasts do the same: 'tis true; but ancient fame Says, Gods themselves turn'd Beasts to do the same. The Thunderer, who, without the Female bed, Could Goddesses bring forth from out his head, Chose rather Mortals this way to create; So much he 'esteemed his pleasure, 'bove his state. Ye talk of Fires which shine, but never burn; In this cold world they'll hardly serve our turn; As useless to despairing Lovers grown, As Lambent flames, to men i'th' Frigid Zone. The Sun does his pure fires on earth bestow With nuptial warmth, to bring forth things below; Such is Loves noblest and divinest heat, That warms like his, and does, like his, beget. Lust you call this; a name to yours more just, If an Inordinate Desire be Lust: Pygmalion, loving what none can enjoy, More lustful was, than the hot youth of Troy. The vain Love. Loving one first because she could love no body, afterwards loving her with desire. What new-found Witchcraft was in thee, With thine own Cold to kindle Me? Strange art! like him that should devise To make a Burning-Glass of Ice; When Winter, so, the Plants would harm, Her snow it self does keep them warm; Fool that I was! who having found A rich, and sunny Diamond, Admir'd the hardness of the Stone, But not the Light with which it shone: Your brave and haughty scorn of all Was stately, and Monarchical. All Gentleness with that esteem'd A dull and slavish virtue seem'd; Shouldst thou have yielded then to me, Thou'dst lost what I most lov'd in thee; For who would serve one, whom he sees That he can Conquer if he please? It far'ed with me, as if a slave In Triumph led, that does perceive With what a gay majestick pride His Conqu'eror through the streets does ride, Should be contented with his wo, Which makes up such a comly show. I sought not from thee a return, But without Hopes or Fears did burn; My Covetous Passion did approve The Hoording up, not Use of Love. My Love a kind of Dream was grown, A Foolish, but a Pleasant one: From which I'm wakened now, but, oh, Prisoners to dye are wakened so. For now th' Effects of Loving are Nothing, but Longings with despair. Despair, whose torments no men sure But Lovers, and the Damn'd endure. Her scorn I doted once upon, Ill Object for Affection, But since, alas, too much 'tis prov'd, That yet 'twas something that I lov'd; Now my desires are worse, and fly At an Impossibility: Desires, which whilst so high they soar, Are Proud as that I lov'd before. What Lover can like me complain, Who first lov'd vainly, next in vain! The Soul. 1. If mine Eyes do e're declare They have seen a second thing that's fair; Or Ears, that they have Musick found, Besides thy Voice, in any Sound; If my Tast do ever meet, After thy Kiss, with ought that's sweet; If my 'abused Touch allow Ought to be smooth, or soft, but You; If, what seasonable Springs, Or the Eastern Summer brings, Do my Smell perswade at all, Ought Perfume, but thy Breath to call; If all my senses Objects be Not contracted into Thee, And so through Thee more powe'rful pass, As Beams do through a Burning-Glass; If all things that in Nature are Either soft, or sweet, or fair, Be not in Thee so 'Epitomiz'd, That nought material's not compriz'd; May I as worthless seem to Thee As all, but Thou, appears to Me. 2. If I ever Anger know, Till some wrong be done to You; If Gods or Kings my Envy move, Without their Crowns crown'd by thy Love; If ever I an Hope admit, Without thy Image stampt on it; Or any Fear, till I begin To find that You'r concern'd therein; If a Joy e're come to me, That Tasts of any thing but Thee; If any Sorrow touch my Mind, Whilst You are well, and not unkind; If I a minutes space debate, Whether I shall curse and hate The things beneath thy hatred fall, Though all the World, My self and all; And for Love, if ever I Approach to it again so nigh, As to allow a Toleration To the least glimmering Inclination; If thou alone do'st not controul All those Tyrants of my Soul, And to thy Beauties ty'st them so, That constant they as Habits grow; If any Passion of my Heart, By any force, or any art, Be brought to move one step from Thee, Mayst Thou no Passion have for Me. 3. If my busie 'Imagination Do not Thee in all things fashion; So that all fair Species be Hieroglyphick marks of Thee; If when She her sports does keep (The lower Soul being all asleep) She play one Dream with all her art, Where Thou hast not the longest part. If ought get place in my Remembrance, Without some badge of thy resemblance; So that thy parts become to me A kind of Art of Memory. If my Understanding do Seek any Knowledge but of You, If she do near thy Body prize Her Bodies of Philosophies, If She to the Will do show Ought desirable but You, Or if That would not rebel, Should she another doctrine tell; If my Will do not resign All her Liberty to thine; If she would not follow Thee, Though Fate and Thou shouldst disagree; And if (for I a curse will give, Such as shall force thee to believe) My Soul be not entirely Thine; May thy dear Body ne're be Mine. The Passions. 1 From Hate, Fear, Hope, Anger, and Envy free, And all the Passions else that be, In vain I boast of Liberty, In vain this State a Freedom call; Since I have Love, and Love is all: Sot that I am, who think it fit to brag, That I have no Disease besides the Plague! 2 So in a zeal the Sons of Israel, Sometimes upon their Idols fell; And they depos'd the powers of Hell, Baal, and Astarte down they threw, And Accaron and Molock too: All this imperfect Piety did no good, Whilst yet, alas, the Calf of Bethel stood. 3 Fondly I boast, that I have drest my Vine With painful art, and that the Wine Is of a tast rich and divine, Since Love by mixing Poyson there, Has made it worse than Vinegere. Love even the tast of Nectar changes so, That Gods choose rather water here below. 4 Fear, Anger, Hope, all Passions else that be, Drive this one Tyrant out of me, And practise all your Tyranny. The change of ills some good will do: Th' oppressed wretched Indians so, Be'ing slaves by the great Spanish Monarch made, Call in the States of Holland to their aid. Wisdom. 'Tis mighty Wise that you would now be thought With your grave Rules from musty Morals brought: Through which some streaks too of Divin'ity ran, Partly of Monk, and partly Puritan; With tedious Repetitions too y'ave tane Often the name of Vanity in vain. Things, which, I take it, friend, you'd ne're recite, Should she I love, but say t' you, Come at night. The Wisest King refus'd all pleasures quite, Till Wisdom from above did him enlight; But when that gift his ign'orance did remove, Pleasures he chose, and plac'd them all in Love. And if by 'event the Counsels may be seen, This wisdom 'twas that brought the Southern Queen. She came not, like a good old Wife, to know The wholesome nature of all Plants that grow: Nor did so far from her own Country rome, To cure scall'd heads, and broken shins at home; She came for that, which more befits all Wives, The art of Giving, not of Saving Lives. The Despair. 1 Beneath this gloomy shade, By Nature only for my sorrows made, I'll spend this voyce in crys, In tears I'll waste these eyes By Love so vainly fed; So Lust of old the Deluge punished. Ah wretched youth! said I, Ah wretched youth! twice did I sadly cry: Ah wretched youth! the fields and floods reply. 2 When thoughts of Love I entertain, I meet no words but Never, and In vain. Never (alas) that dreadful name, Which fewels the infernal flame: Never, my time to come must waste; In vain, torments the present, and the past. In vain, in vain! said I; In vain, in vain! twice did I sadly cry; In vain, in vain! the fields and floods reply. 3 No more shall fields or floods do so; For I to shades more dark and silent go: All this worlds noise appears to me A dull ill-acted Comedy: No comfort to my wounded sight, In the Suns busie and imperti'nent Light. Then down I laid my head; Down on cold earth; and for a while was dead, And my freed Soul to a strange Somewhere fled. 4 Ah sottish Soul; said I, When back to 'its Cage again I saw it fly: Fool to resume her broken chain! And row her Galley here again! Fool, to that body to return Where it condemn'd and destin'd is to burn! Once dead, how can it be, Death should a thing so pleasant seem to Thee, That thou shouldst come to live it o're again in Me? The Wish. 1. Well then; I now do plainly see, This busie world and I shall ne're agree; The very Honey of all earthly joy Does of all meats the soonest cloy, And they (methinks) deserve my pity, Who for it can endure the stings, The Crowd, and Buz, and Murmurings Of this great Hive, the City. 2. Ah, yet, e're I descend to th' Grave May I a small House, and large Garden have! And a few Friends, and many Books, both true, Both wise, and both delightful too! And since Love ne're will from me flee, A Mistress moderately fair, And good as Guardian-Angels are, Only belov'd, and loving me! 3. Oh, Fountains, when in you shall I My self, eas'd of unpeaceful thoughts, espy? Oh Fields! Oh Woods! when, when shall I be made The happy Tenant of your shade? Here's the Spring-head of Pleasures flood; Where all the Riches lie, that she Has coyn'd and stampt for good. 4. Pride and Ambition here, Only in far fetcht Metaphors appear; Here nought but winds can hurtful Murmurs scatter, And nought but Eccho flatter. The Gods, when they descended, hither From Heav'en did always chuse their way; And therefore we may boldly say, That 'tis the way too thither. 5. How happy here should I, And one dear She live, and embr[ac]ing dy? She who is all the world, and can exclude In desarts Solitude. I should have then this only fear, Lest men, when they my pleasures see, Should hither throng to live like me, And so make a City here. My Dyet. 1 Now by my Love, the greatest Oath that is, None loves you half so well as I: I do not ask your Love for this; But for Heave'ns sake believe me, or I dye. No Servant e're but did deserve His Master should believe that he does serve; And I'll ask no more wages, though I starve. 2 'Tis no luxurious Diet this, and sure I shall not by't too Lusty prove; Yet shall it willingly endure, If't can but keep together Life and Love. Being your Priso'ner and your slave, I do not Feasts and Banquets look to have, A little Bread and Water's all I crave. 3 O'n a Sigh of Pity I a year can live, One Tear will keep me twenty at least, Fifty a gentle Look will give; An hundred years on one kind word I'll feast: A thousand more will added be, If you an Inclination have for me; And all beyond is vast Eternity. The Thief. 1 Thou rob'st my Days of bus'ness and delights, Of sleep thou rob'st my Nights; Ah, lovely Thief what wilt thou do? What? rob me of Heaven too? Thou even my prayers dost steal from me. And I, with wild Idolatry, Begin, to God, and end them all, to Thee. 2 Is it a Sin to Love, that it should thus, Like an ill Conscience torture us? What e're I do, where e're I go, (None Guiltless e're was haunted so) Still, still, methinks thy face I view, And still thy shape does me pursue, As if, not you Me, but I had murthered You. 3 From Books I strive some remedy to take, But thy Name all the Letters make; What e're 'tis writ, I find That there, Like Points and Comma's every where; Me blest for this let no man hold; For I, as Midas did of old, Perish by turning ev'ry thing to Gold. 4 What do I seek, alas, or why do I Attempt in vain from thee to fly? For making thee my Deity, I gave thee then Ubiquity. My pains resemble Hell in this; The Divine presence there too is, But to torment Men, not to give them bliss. All-over, Love. 1 'Tis well, 'tis well with them (say I) Whose short-liv'd Passions with themselves can dye: For none can be unhappy, who 'Midst all his ills a time does know (Though ne're so long) when he shall not be so. 2 What ever parts of Me remain, Those parts will still the Love of thee retain; For 'twas not only in my Heart, But like a God by pow'rful Art, 'Twas all in all, and all in every Part. 3 My 'Affection no more perish can Than the First Matter that compounds a Man. Hereafter if one Dust of Me Mixt with anothers substance be, 'Twill Leaven that whole Lump with Love of Thee. 4 Let Nature if she please disperse My Atoms over all the Universe, At the last they easi'ly shall Themselves know, and together call; For thy Love, like a Mark, is stamp'd on all. Love and Life. 1 Now sure, within this twelve-month past, I' have lov'd at least some twenty years or more: The account of Love runs much more fast Than that, with which our Life does score: So though my Life be short, yet I may prove The great Methusalem of Love. 2 Not that Loves Hours or Minutes are Shorter than those our Being's measur'ed by: But they're more close compacted far, And so in lesser room do lye. Thin airy things extend themselves in space, Things solid take up little place. 3 Yet Love, alas, and Life in Me, Are not two several things, but purely one, At once how can there in it be A double different Motion? O yes, there may: for so the self same Sun, At once does slow and swiftly run. 4 Swiftly his daily journey 'he goes, But treads his Annual with a statelier pace, And does three hundred Rounds enclose Within one yearly Circles space. At once with double course in the same Sphære, He runs the Day, and Walks the year. 5 When Soul does to my self refer, 'Tis then my Life, and does but slowly move; But when it does relate to her, It swiftly flies, and then is Love. Love's my Diurnal course, divided right 'Twixt Hope and Fear, my Day and Night. The Bargain. 1 Take heed, take heed, thou lovely Maid, Nor be by glittering ills betraid; Thy self for Money? oh, let no man know The Price of Beauty faln so low! What dangers ought'st thou not to dread, When Love that's Blind is by blind Fortune led? 2 The foolish Indian that sells His precious Gold for Beads and Bells, Does a more wise and gainful traffick hold, Then thou who sell'st thy self for Gold. What gains in such a bargain are? Hee'l in thy Mines dig better Treasures far. 3 Can Gold, alas, with Thee compare? The Sun, that makes it 's not so fair; The Sun which can nor make, nor ever see A thing so beautiful as Thee, In all the journeys he does pass, Though the Sea serv'ed him for a Looking-glass. 4 Bold was the wretch that cheapned Thee, Since Magus, none so bold as he: Thou'rt so divine a thing that Thee to buy, Is to be counted Simony; Too dear he'l find his sordid price, H'as forfeited that, and the Benefice. 5 If it be lawful Thee to buy, There's none can pay that rate but I; Nothing on earth a fitting price can be, But what on earth's most like to Thee. And that my Heart does only bear; For there Thy self, Thy very self is there. 6 So much thy self does in me live, That when it for thy self I give, 'Tis but to change that piece of Gold for this, Whose stamp and value equal is. And that full Weight too may be had, My Soul and Body; two Grains more, I'll add. The Long Life. 1 Love from Times wings hath stoln the feathers sure, He has, and put them to his own; For Hours of late as long as Days endure, And very Minutes, Hours are grown. 2 The various Motions of the turning Year, Belong not now at all to Me: Each Summers Night does Lucies now appear, Each Winters day St. Barnaby. 3 How long a space, since first I lov'd, it is? To look into a glass I fear; And am surpriz'd with wonder when I miss, Grey-hairs and wrinkles there. 4 Th' old Patriarchs age and not their happ'iness too, Why does hard fate to us restore? Why does Loves Fire thus to Mankind renew, What the Flood washt away before? 5 Sure those are happy people that complain, O' th' shortness of the days of man: Contract mine, Heaven, and bring them back again To th' ordinary Span. 6 If when your gift, long Life, I disapprove, I too ingrateful seem to be; Punish me justly, Heaven; make Her to love, And then 'twill be too short for me. Counsel. 1 Gently, ah gently, Madam, touch The wound, which you your self have made; That pain must needs be very much, Which makes me of your hand afraid. Cordials of Pity give me now, For I too weak for Purgings grow. 2 Do but a while with patience stay; For Counsel yet will do no good, 'Till Time, and Rest, and Heav'n allay The vi'olent burnings of my blood, For what effect from this can flow, To chide men drunk, for being so? 3 Perhaps the Physick's good you give, But ne're to me can useful prove; Med'cines may Cure, but not Revive; And I'am not Sick, but Dead in Love. In Loves Hell, not his World, am I; At once I Live, am Dead, and Dye. 4 What new found Rhetorick is thine? Ev'n thy Diswasions me perswade, And thy great power does clearest shine, When thy Commands are disobey'd. In vain thou bidst me to forbear; Obedience were Rebellion here. 5 Thy Tongue comes in, as if it meant Against thine Eyes t'assist my Heart; But different far was his intent: For straight the Traitor took their part. And by this new foe I'm bereft Of all that Little which was left. 6 The act I must confess was wise, As a dishonest act could be: Well knew the Tongue (alas) your Eyes Would be too strong for That, and Me. And part o'th' Triumph chose to get, Rather than be a part of it. Resolved to be beloved. 1 'Tis true, I'have lov'd already three or four, And shall three or four hundred more; I'll love each fair one that I see, Till I find one at last that shall love me. 2 That shall my Canaan be, the fatal soil, That ends my wandrings, and my toil. I'll settle there and happy grow; The Country does with Milk and Honey flow. 3 The Needle trembles so, and turns about, Till it the Northern Point find out: But constant then and fixt does prove, Fixt, that his dearest Pole as soon may move. 4 Then may my Vessel torn and shipwrackt be, If it put forth again to Sea: It never more abroad shall rome, Though't could next voyage bring the Indies home. 5 But I must sweat in Love, and labour yet, Till I a Competency get. They're slothful fools who leave a Trade, Till they a moderate Fortune by't have made. 6 Variety I ask not; give me One To live perpetually upon. The person Love does to us fit, Like Manna, has the Tast of all in it. The Same. 1 For Heavens sake, what d' you mean to do? Keep me, or let me go, one of the two; Youth and warm hours let me not idlely lose, The little Time that Love does choose; If always here I must not stay, Let me be gone, whilst yet 'tis day; Lest I faint, and benighted lose my way. 2 'Tis dismal, One so long to love In vain; till to love more as vain must prove: To hunt so long on nimble prey, till we Too weary to take others be; Alas, 'tis folly to remain, And waste our Army thus in vain, Before a City which will ne're be tane. 3 At several hopes wisely to fly, Ought not to be esteem'd Inconstancy; 'Tis more Inconstant always to pursue, A thing that always flies from you; For that at last may meet a bound, But no end can to this be found, 'Tis nought but a perpetual fruitless Round. 4 When it does Hardness meet and Pride, My Love does then rebound t'another side; But if it ought that's soft and yielding hit; It lodges there, and stays in it. Whatever 'tis shall first love me, That it my Heaven may truly be; I shall be sure to give't Eternity. The Discovery. 1 By 'Heaven I'll tell her boldly that 'tis She; Why should she asham'd or angry be, To be belov'd by Me? The Gods may give their Altars o're; They'll smoak but seldom any more, If none but Happy Men must them adore. 2 The Lightning which tall Oaks oppose in vain, To strike sometime does not disdain The humble Furzes of the Plain. She being so high, and I so low, Her power by this does greater show, Who at such distance gives so sure a blow. 3 Compar'd with her all things so worthless prove, That nought on earth can tow'ards her move, Till't be exalted by her Love. Equal to her, alas, there's none; She like a Deity is grown; That must Create, or else must be alone. 4 If there be man, who thinks himself so high, As to pretend equality, He deserves her less then I; For he would cheat for his relief; And one would give with lesser grief, To'an undeserving Beggar than a Thief. Against Fruition. No; thou'rt a fool, I'll swear, if e're thou grant: Much of my Veneration thou must want, When once thy kindness puts my Ign'orance out; For a learn'd Age is always least devout. Keep still thy distance; for at once to me Goddess and Woman too, thou canst not be; Thou'rt Queen of all that sees thee; and as such Must neither Tyrannize, nor yield too much; Such freedoms give as may admit Command, But keep the Forts and Magazines in thine hand. Thou'rt yet a whole world to me, and do'est fill My large ambition; but 'tis dang'rous still, Lest I like the Pellæan Prince should be, And weep for other worlds hav'ing conquer'd thee; When Love has taken all thou hast away, His strength by too much riches will decay. Thou in my Fancy dost much higher stand, Than Women can be place'd by Natures hand; And I must needs, I'm sure, a loser be, To change Thee, as Thou'rt there, for very Thee. Thy sweetness is so much within me plac'd, That shouldst thou Nectar give, 'twould spoil the tast. Beauty at first moves wonder, and delight; 'Tis Natures juggling trick to cheat the sight, We 'admire it, whilst unknown, but after more Admire our selves, for liking it before. Love, like a greedy Hawk, if we give way, Does over-gorge himself, with his own Prey; Of very Hopes a surfeit he'll sustain, Unless by Fears he cast them up again: His spirit and sweetness dangers keep alone; If once he lose his sting, he grows a Drone. Love undiscovered. 1 Some, others may with safety tell The moderate Flames, which in them dwell; And either find some Med'icine there, Or cure themselves ev'en by Despair; My Love's so great, that it might prove Dang'erous, to tell her that I Love. So tender is my wound, it must not bear Any salute, though of the kindest air. 2 I would not have her know the pain, The Torments for her I sustain, Lest too much goodness make her throw Her Love upon a Fate too low. Forbid it Heaven my Life should be Weigh'd with her least Conveniency: No, let me perish rather with my grief, Then to her disadvantage find relief. 3 Yet when I dye, my last breath shall Grow bold, and plainly tell her all. Like covetous Men who ne're descry, Their dear hid Treasures till they dye. Ah fairest Maid, how will it chear My Ghost, to get from Thee a tear! But take heed; for if me thou Pitiest then, Twenty to one but I shall live agen. The given Heart. 1 I wonder what those Lovers mean, who say, They have giv'en their Hearts away. Some good kind Lover tell me how; For mine is but a Torment to me now. 2 If so it be, one place both hearts contain, For what do they complain? What courtesie can Love do more, Than to join Hearts, that parted were before? 3 Wo to her stubborn Heart, if once mine come Into the self same room; 'Twill tear and blow up all within, Like a Granado shot into a Magazin. 4 Then shall Love keep the ashes, and torn parts, Of both our broken Hearts: Shall out of both one new one make, From hers, th' Allay; from mine, the Metal take. 5 For of her heart he from the flames will find But little left behind: Mine only will remain entire; No dross was there, to perish in the Fire. The Prophet. 1. Teach me to Love? go teach thy self more wit; I chief Professour am of it. Teach craft to Scots, and thrift to Jews, Teach boldness to the Stews; In Tyrants Courts teach supple flattery, Teach Jesuits, that have travell'd far, to Lye. Teach Fire to burn, and Winds to blow, Teach restless Fountains how to flow, Teach the dull earth, fixt, to abide, Teach Woman-kind inconstancy and Pride. See if your diligence here will useful prove; But, pr'ithee, teach not me to Love. 2. The God of Love, if such a thing there be, May learn to love from Me. He who does boast that he has bin In every Heart since Adams sin, I'll lay my Life, nay Mistress on't, that's more; I'll teach him things he never knew before; I'll teach him a Receipt to make Words that weep, and Tears that speak, I'll teach him Sighs, like those in Death, At which the Souls go out too with the breath: Still the Soul stays, yet still does from me run; As Light and Heat does with the Sun. 3. 'Tis I who Love's Columbus am; 'tis I, Who must new Worlds in it descry: Rich Worlds, that yield of Treasure more, Than all that has bin known before. And yet like his (I fear) my Fate must be, To find them out for others; not for Me. Me Times to come, I know it, shall Loves last and greatest Prophet call. But, ah, what's that, if she refuse, To hear the wholesome Doctrines of my Muse? If to my share the Prophets fate must come; Hereafter Fame, here Martyrdome. The Resolution. 1 The Devil take those foolish men, Who gave you first such pow'rs; We stood on even grounds till then; If any odds, Creation made it ours. 2 For shame let these weak Chains be broke; Let's our slight bonds, like Sampson, tear; And nobly cast away that yoke, Which we nor our Forefathers e're could bear. 3 French Laws forbid the Female Raign; Yet Love does them to slavery draw, Alas, if we'll our rights maintain, 'Tis all Mankind must make a Salique Law. Called Inconstant. 1 Ha! ha! you think y'have kill'd my fame; By this not understood, yet common Name: A Name, that's full and proper when assign'd To Woman-kind: But when you call us so, It can at best but for a Met'aphor go. 2 Can you the shore Inconstant call, Which still as Waves pass by, embraces all; That had as leif the same Waves always love, Did they not from him move? Or can you fault with Pilots find For changing course, yet never blame the wind? 3 Since drunk with vanity you fell: The things turn round to you that stedfast dwell; And you your self, who from us take your flight, Wonder to find us out of sight. So the same errour seizes you, As Men in motion think the Trees move too. The Welcome. 1 Go, let the fatted Calf be kill'd; My Prodigal's come home at last; With noble resolutions fill'd, And fill'd with sorrow for the past. No more will burn with Love or Wine: But quite has left his Women and his Swine. 2 Welcome, ah welcome my poor Heart; Welcome; I little thought, I'll swear, ('Tis now so long since we did part) Ever again to see thee here: Dear Wanderer, since from me you fled, How often have I heard that Thou wer't dead! 3 Hast thou not found each womans breast (The Lands where thou hast travelled) Either by Savages possest, Or wild, and uninhabited? What joy couldst take, or what repose In Countrys so unciviliz'd as those? 4 Lust, the scorching Dog-star, here Rages with immoderate heart; Whilst Pride the rugged Northern Bear, In others makes the Cold too great. And where these are temp'rate known, The Soyl's all barren Sand, or rocky Stone. 5 When once or twice you chanc'd to view A rich, well-govern'd Heart, Like China, it admitted You But to the Frontier-part. From Par'adise shut for evermore, What good is't that an Angel kept the Door? 6 Well fare the Pride, and the Disdain, And Vanities with Beauty joyn'd, I ne're had seen this Heart again, If any Fair one had been kind: My Dove, but once let loose, I doubt Would ne're return, had not the Flood been out. The Heart fled again. 1 False, foolish Heart! didst thou not say, That thou wouldst never leave me more? Behold again 'tis fled away, Fled as far from me as before. I strove to bring it back again, I cry'd and hollow'd after it in vain. 2 Even so the gentle Tyrian Dame, When neither Grief nor Love prevail, Saw the dear object of her flame, Th'ingrateful Trojan hoist his sail: Aloud she call'd to him to stay; The wind bore him, and her lost words away. 3 The doleful Ariadne so, On the wide shore forsaken stood: False Theseus, whither dost thou go? Afar false Theseus cut the flood. But Bacchus came to her relief; Bacchus himself's too weak to ease my grief. 4 Ah senseless Heart, to take no rest, But travel thus eternally! Thus to be froz'n in every breast! And to be scorcht in every Eye! Wandring about like wretched Cain, Thrust out, ill us'd by all, but by none slain! 5 Well; since thou wilt not here remain, I'll ev'en to live without Thee try; My Head shall take the greater pain, And all thy duties shall supply; I can more easi'ly live I know Without Thee, then without a Mistress Thou. Womens Superstition. 1 Or I'm a very Dunce, or Womankind Is a most unintelligible thing: I can no Sense, nor no Contexture find, Nor their loose parts to Method bring, I know not what the Learn'd may see, But they're strange Hebrew things to Me. 2 By Customs and Traditions they live, And foolish Ceremonies of antique date, We Lovers, new and better Doctrines give. Yet they continue obstinate; Preach we, Loves Prophets, what we will, Like Jews, they keep their old Law still. 3 Before their Mothers Gods, they fondly fall, Vain Idol-Gods that have no Sense nor Mind: Honour's their Ashtaroth, and Pride their Baal, The Thundring Baal of Woman-kind. With twenty other Devils more, Which They, as We do Them, adore. 4 But then, like Men both Covetous and Devout, Their costly Superstition loth t'omit, And yet more loth to issue Moneys out, At their own charge to furnish it. To these expensive Deities, The Hearts of Men they Sacrifice. The Soul. 1 Some dull Philos'opher when he hears me say, My Soul is from me fled away; Nor has of late inform'd my Body here, But in anothers breast does ly, That neither Is, nor will be I, As a Form Servient and Assisting there: 2 Will cry, Absurd! and ask me, how I live: And Syllogisms against it give; A curse on all your vain Philosophies, Which on weak Natures Law depend, And know not how to comprehend Love and Religion, those great Mysteries. 3 Her Body is my Soul; laugh not at this, For by my Life I swear it is. 'Tis that preserves my Being and my Breath, From that proceeds all that I do, Nay all my Thoughts and speeches too, And separation from it is my Death. Eccho. 1 Tir'ed with the rough denials of my Prayer, From that hard she whom I obey, I come, and find a Nymph, much gentler here, That gives consent to all I say. Ah gentle Nymph who lik'st so well, In hollow, solitary Caves to dwell, Her Heart being such, into it go, And do but once from thence answer me so. 2 Complaisant Nymph, who do'est thus kindly share In griefs, whose cause thou do'est not know! Hadst thou but Eyes, as well as Tongue and Ear, How much compassion wouldst thou show! Thy flame, whilst living, or a flower, Was of less beauty, and less rav'ishing power; Alas, I might as easilie, Paint thee to her, as describe Her to Thee. 3 By repercussion Beams engender Fire, Shapes by reflexion shapes beget; The voyce it self, when stopt, does back retire, And a new voice is made by it. Thus things by opposition The gainers grow; my barren Love alone, Does from her stony breast rebound, Producing neither Image, Fire, nor Sound. The rich Rival. 1 They say you're angry, and rant mightilie, Because I love the same as you; Alas! you're very rich; 'tis true; But prithee Fool, what's that to Love and Me? You'have Land and Money, let that serve; And know you'have more by that than you deserve. 2 When next I see my fair One, she shall know, How worthless thou art of her bed; And wretch, I'll strike thee dumb and dead, With noble verse not understood by you; Whilst thy sole Rhetorick shall be Joynture, and Jewels, and Our Friends agree. 3 Pox o' your friends, that dote and Domineere: Lovers are better Friends than they: Let's those in other things obey; The Fates, and Stars, and Gods must govern here. Vain names of Blood! in Love let none Advise with any Blood, but with their own. 4 'Tis that which bids me this bright Maid adore; No other thought has had access! Did she now beg I'd love no less, And were she'an Empress, I should love no more; Were she as just and true to Me, Ah, simple soul, what would become of Thee! Against Hope. 1 Hope, whose weak Being ruin'd is, Alike if it succeed, and if it miss; Whom Good or Ill does equally confound, And both the Horns of Fates Dilemma wound. Vain shadow! which dost vanish quite, Both at full Noon, and perfect Night! The Stars have not a possibility Of blessing Thee; If things then from their End we happy call, 'Tis Hope is the most Hopeless thing of all. 2 Hope, thou bold Taster of Delight, Who whilst thou shouldst but tast, devour'st it quite! Thou bringst us an Estate, yet leav'st us Poor, By clogging it with Legacies before! The Joys which we entire should wed, Come deflowr'd Virgins to our bed; Good fortunes without gain imported be, Such mighty Custom's paid to Thee. For Joy, like Wine, kept close does better tast; If it take air before, its spirits wast. 3 Hope, Fortunes cheating Lottery! Where for one prize an hundred blanks there be; Fond Archer, Hope, who tak'st thy aim so far, That still or short, or wide thine arrows are! Thin, empty Cloud, which th'eye deceives With shapes that our own Fancy gives! A Cloud, which gilt and painted now appears, But must drop presently in tears! When thy false beams o're Reasons light prevail, By Ignes fatui for North-Stars we sail. 4 Brother of Fear, more gaily clad! The merr'ier Fool o'th' two, yet quite as Mad: Sire of Repentance, Child of fond Desire! That blow'st the Chymicks, and the Lovers fire! Leading them still insensibly 'on By the strange witchcraft of Anon! By Thee the one does changing Nature through Her endless Labyrinths pursue, And th'other chases Woman, whilst She goes More ways and turns than hunted Nature knows. For Hope. 1 Hope, of all Ills that men endure, The only cheap and Universal Cure! Thou Captives freedom, and Thou sick Mans Health! Thou Losers Victo'ry, and thou Beggars wealth! Thou Manna, which from Heav'n we eat, To every Tast a several Meat! Thou strong Retreat! thou sure entail'd Estate, Which nought has power to alienate! Thou pleasant, honest Flatterer! for none Flatter unhappy Men, but thou alone! 2 Hope, thou First-fruits of Happiness! Thou gentle Dawning of a bright Success! Thou good Prepar'ative, without which our Joy Does work too strong, and whilst it cures, destroy; Who out of Fortunes reach dost stand, And art a blessing still in hand! Whilst Thee, her Earnest-Money we retain, We certain are to gain, Whether she'her bargain break, or else fulfill; Thou only good, not worse, for ending ill! 3 Brother of Faith, 'twixt whom and Thee The joys of Heav'en and Earth divided be! Though Faith be Heir, and have the fixt estate, Thy Portion yet in Moveables is great. Happiness it self's all one In Thee, or in possession! Only the Future's Thine, the present His! Thine's the more hard and noble bliss; Best apprehender of our joys, which hast So long a reach, and yet canst hold so fast! 4 Hope, thou sad Lovers only Friend! Thou Way that mayst dispute it with the End! For Love I fear's a fruit that does delight The Tast it self less than the Smell and Sight. Fruition more deceitful is Than Thou canst be, when thou dost miss; Men leave thee by obtaining, and strait flee Some other way again to Thee; And that's a pleasant Country, without doubt, To which all soon return that travel out. Loves Ingratitude. 1 I little thought, thou fond ingrateful Sin, When first I let thee in, And gave thee but a part In my unwary Heart, That thou wouldst e're have grown, So false or strong to make it all thine own. 2 At mine own breast with care I fed thee still, Letting thee suck thy fill, And daintily I nourisht Thee With Idle thoughts and Poetrie! What ill returns dost thou allow? I fed thee then, and thou dost starve me now. 3 There was a time, when thou wast cold and chill, Nor hadst the power of doing ill; Into my bosom did I take, This frozen and benummed Snake, Not fearing from it any harm; But now it stings that breast which made it warm. 4 What cursed weed's this Love! but one grain sow, And the whole field 'twill overgrow; Strait will it choak up and devour Each wholesome herb and beauteous flour! Nay unless something soon I do, 'Twill kill I fear my very Lawrel too. 5 But now all's gone, I now, alas, complain, Declare, protest, and threat in vain. Since by my own unforc'd consent, The Traytor has my Government, And is so settled in the Throne, That 'twere Rebellion now to claim mine own. The Frailty. 1 I know 'tis sordid, and 'tis low; (All this as well as you I know) Which I so hotly now pursue; (I know all this as well as you) But whilst this cursed flesh I bear, And all the Weakness, and the Baseness there, Alas, alas, it will be always so. 2 In vain, exceedingly in vain I rage sometimes, and bite my Chain; For to what purpose do I bite With Teeth which ne're will break it quite? For if the chiefest Christian Head, Was by this sturdy Tyrant buffeted, What wonder is it, if weak I be slain? Coldness. 1 As water fluid is, till it do grow Solid and fixt by Cold; So in warm Seasons Love does loosely flow, Frost only can it hold. A Womans rigour, and disdain, Does his swift course restrain. 2 Though constant, and consistent now it be, Yet, when kind beams appear, It melts, and glides apace into the Sea, And loses it self there. So the Suns amorous play, Kisses the Ice away. 3 You may in Vulgar Loves find always this; But my Substantial Love Of a more firm, and perfect Nature is; No weathers can it move: Though Heat dissolve the Ice again, The Chrystal solid does remain. [Then like some wealthy Island thou shalt ly] 1 Then like some wealthy Island thou shalt ly; And like the Sea about it, I; Thou like fair Albion, to the Sailors Sight, Spreading her beauteous Bosom all in White: Like the kind Ocean I will be, With loving Arms for ever clasping Thee. 2 But I'll embrace Thee gentli'er far than so; As their fresh Banks soft Rivers do, Nor shall the proudest Planet boast a power Of making my full Love to ebb one hour; It never dry or low can prove, Whilst thy unwasted Fountain feeds my Love. 3 Such Heat and Vigour shall our Kisses bear, As if like Doves we' engendred there. No bound nor rule my pleasures shall endure, In Love there's none too much an Epicure. Nought shall my hands or Lips controul; I'll kiss Thee through, I'll kiss thy very Soul. 4 Yet nothing, but the Night our sports shall know; Night that's both blind and silent too. Alphæus found not a more secret trace, His lov'd Sicanian Fountain to embrace, Creeping so far beneath the Sea, Than I will do t' enjoy, and feast on Thee. 5 Men, out of Wisdom; Women, out of Pride, The pleasant Thefts of Love do hide. That may secure thee; but thou 'hast yet from Me A more infallible Securitie. For there's no danger I should tell The Joys, which are to Me unspeakable. Sleep. 1 In vain, thou drousie God, I thee invoak; For thou, who dost from fumes arise, Thou, who Mans Soul dost overshade With a thick Cloud by Vapours made, Canst have no power to shut his eyes, Or passage of his Spi'rits to choak, Whose flame's so pure, that it sends up no smoak. 2 Yet how do Tears but from some Vapours rise? Tears, that bewinter all my Year? The fate of Egypt I sustain, And never feel the dew of Rain, From Clouds which in the Head appear, But all my too much Moysture ow, To overflowings of the Heart below. 3 Thou, who dost Men (as Nights to Colours do) Bring all to an Equality: Come, thou just God, and equal me A while to my disdainful She; In that condition let me ly; Till Love does the favour shew; Love equals all a better way than You. 4 Then never more shalt thou be'invokt by me; Watchful as Spirits, and Gods I'll prove: Let her but grant, and then will I, Thee and thy Kinsman Death defy. For betwixt Thee and them that love, Never will an agreement be; Thou scorn'st th' Unhappy; and the Happy, Thee. Beauty. 1 Beauty, thou wild fantastick Ape, Who dost in ev'ry Country change thy shape! Here black, there brown, here tawny, and there white; Thou Flatt'rer which compli'st with every sight! Thou Babel which confound'st the Ey With unintelligible variety! Who hast no certain What, nor Where, But vary'st still, and dost thy self declare Inconstant, as thy she-Professors are. 2 Beauty, Loves Scene and Maskerade, So gay by well-plac'd Lights, and Distance made; False Coyn, with which th'Impostor cheats us still; The Stamp and Colour good, but Metal ill! Which Light, or Base we find, when we Weigh by Enjoyment, and examine Thee! For though thy Being be but show, 'Tis chiefly Night which men to Thee allow: And chuse t'enjoy Thee, when Thou least art Thou. 3 Beauty, Thou active, passive Ill! Which dy'st thy self as fast as thou dost kill! Thou Tulip, who thy stock in paint dost waste, Neither for Physick good, nor Smell, nor Tast. Beauty, whose Flames but Meteors are, Short-liv'd and low, though thou wouldst seem a Star, Who dar'st not thine own Home descry, Pretending to dwell richly in the Eye, When thou, alas, dost in the Fancy lye. 4 Beauty, whose Conquests still are made O're Hearts by Cowards kept, or else betray'd! Weak Victor! who thy self destroy'd must be When sickness storms, or Time besieges Thee! Thou'unwholesome Thaw to frozen Age! Thou strong wine, which youths Feaver dost enrage, Thou Tyrant which leav'st no man free! Thou subtle thief, from whom nought safe can be! Thou Murth'rer which hast kill'd, &amp; Devil which wouldst Damn me. The Parting. 1 As Men in Groen-land left beheld the Sun From their Horizon run; And thought upon the sad half year Of Cold and Darkness they must suffer there: 2 So on my parting Mistress did I look, With such swoln eyes my farewel took; Ah, my fair Star! said I; Ah those blest Lands to which bright Thou dost fly! 3 In vain the Men of Learning comfort me; And say I'm in a warm degree; Say what they please; I say and swear 'Tis beyond eighty at least, if you're not here. 4 It is, it is; I tremble with the Frost, And know that I the Day have lost; And those wild things which Men they call, I find to be but Bears or Foxes all. 5 Return, return, gay Planet of mine East, Of all that shines Thou much the Best! And as thou now descend'st to Sea; More fair and fresh rise up from thence to Me. 6 Thou, who in many a Propriety, So truly art the Sun to Me, Adde one more likeness, which I'm sure you can, And let Me and my Sun beget a Man. My Picture. 1 Here, take my Likeness with you, whilst 'tis so; For when from hence you go, The next Suns rising will behold Me pale, and lean, and old. The Man who did this Picture draw, Will swear next day my face he never saw. 2 I really believe, within a while, If you upon this shadow smile, Your presence will such vigour give, (Your presence which makes all things live) And absence so much alter Me, This will the substance, I the shadow be. 3 When from your well-wrought Cabinet you take it, And your bright looks awake it; Ah be not frighted, if you see, The new-soul'd Picture gaze on Thee, And hear it breath a sigh or two; For those are the first things that it will do. 4 My Rival-Image will be then thought blest, And laugh at me as dispossest; But Thou, who (if I know thee right) I'th' substance dost not much delight, Wilt rather send again for Me, Who then shall but my Pictures Picture be. The Concealment. 1 No; to what purpose should I speak? No, wretched Heart, swell till you break! She cannot love me if she would; And to say truth, 'twere pity that she should. No, to the Grave thy sorrows bear, As silent, as they will be there: Since that lov'd hand this mortal wound does give, So handsomly the thing contrive, That she may guiltless of it live. So perish, that her killing Thee May a Chance-Medley, and no Murther be. 2 'Tis nobler much for me, that I By'her Beauty, not her Anger dy; This will look justly, and become An Execution; that, a Martyrdome. The censuring world will ne're refrain From judging men by Thunder slain. She must be angry sure, if I should be So bold to ask her to make me By being hers, happ'ier than She. I will not; 'tis a milder fate To fall by her not Loving, than her Hate. 3 And yet this death of mine, I fear, Will ominous to her appear: When, sound in every other part, Her Sacrifice is found without an Heart. For the last Tempest of my death Shall sigh out that too, with my breath. Then shall the world my noble ruine see, Some pity, and some envy Me, Then She her self, the mighty She, Shall grace my fun'rals with this truth; 'Twas only Love destroy'd the gentle Youth. The Monopoly. 1 What Mines of Sulphur in my breast do ly, That feed th' eternal burnings of my heart? Not Ætna flames more fierce or constantly, The sounding shop of Vulcans smoaky art; Vulcan his shop has placed there, And Cupids Forge is set up here. 2 Here all those Arrows mortal Heads are made, That flye so thick unseen through yielding air; The Cyclops here, which labour at the trade Are Jealousie, Fear, Sadness, and Despair. Ah cruel God! and why to me Gave you this curst Monopolie? 3 I have the trouble, not the gains of it; Give me but the disposal of one Dart; And then (I'll ask no other benefit) Heat as you please your furnace in my Heart. So sweet's Revenge to me, that I Upon my foe would gladly dy. 4 Deep into'her bosom would I strike the dart; Deeper than Woman e're was struck by Thee; Thou giv'st them small wounds, and so far from th'Heart, They flutter still about, inconstantly, Curse on thy Goodness, whom we find Civil to none but Woman-kind! 5 Vain God! who women dost thy self adore! Their wounded Hearts do still retain the powers To travel, and to wander as before; Thy broken Arrows 'twixt that sex and ours So 'unjustly are distributed; They take the Feathers, we the Head. The Distance. 1 I'have followed thee a year at least, And never stopt my self to rest. But yet can thee o'retake no more, Than this Day can the Day that went before. 2 In this our fortunes equal prove To Stars, which govern them above; Our Stars that move for ever round, With the same Distance still betwixt them found. 3 In vain, alas, in vain I strive The wheel of Fate faster to drive; Since if a round it swiftlier fly She in it mends her pace as much as I. 4 Hearts by Love, strangely shuffled are, That there can never meet a Pare! Tamelier than Worms are Lovers slain; The wounded Heart ne're turns to wound again. The Encrease. 1 I thought, I'll swear, I could have lov'd no more Then I had done before; But you as easi'ly might account 'Till to the top of Numbers you amount, As cast up my Loves score. Ten thousand millions was the sum; Millions of endless Millions are to come. 2 I'm sure her Beauties cannot greater grow; Why should my Love do so? A real cause at first did move; But mine own Fancy now drives on my Love, With shadows from it self that flow. My Love, as we in Numbers see, By Cyphers is encreast eternallie. 3 So the new-made, and untride Spheres above, Took their first turn from th' hand of Jove; But are since that beginning found By their own Forms to move for ever round. All violent Motions short do prove, But by the length 'tis plain to see That Love's a Motion Natural to Me. Loves Visibility. 1 With much of pain, and all the Art I knew Have I endeavour'd hitherto To hide my Love, and yet all will not do. 2 The world perceives it, and it may be, she; Though so discreet and good she be, By hiding it, to teach that skill to Me. 3 Men without Love have oft so cunning grown, That something like it they have shown, But none who had it ever seem'd t'have none. 4 Love's of a strangely open, simple kind, Can no arts or disguises find, But thinks none sees it 'cause it self is blind. 5 The very Eye betrays our inward smart; Love of himself left there a part, When thorow it he past into the Heart. 6 Or if by chance the Face betray not it, But keep the secret wisely, yet, Like Drunkenness, into the Tongue t'will get. Looking on, and discoursing with his Mistress. 1 These full two hours now have I gazing been, What comfort by it can I gain? To look on Heav'en with mighty Gulfs between Was the great Misers greatest pain; So neer was he to Heavens delight, As with the blest converse he might, Yet could not get one drop of water by't. 2 Ah wretch! I seem to touch her now; but, oh, What boundless spaces do us part? Fortune, and Friends, and all earths empty show My Lowness, and her high Desert: But these might conquerable prove; Nothing does me so far remove, As her hard Souls aversion from my Love. 3 So Travellers, that lose their way by night, If from afar they chance t'espy Th' uncertain glimmerings of a Tapers light, Take flattering hopes, and think it nigh; Till wearied with the fruitless pain, They sit them down, and weep in vain, And there in Darkness and Despair remain. Resolved to Love. 1 I wonder what the Grave and Wise Think of all us that Love; Whether our Pretty Fooleries Their Mirth or Anger move; They understand not Breath, that Words does want; Our Sighs to them are unsignificant. 2 One of them saw me th' other day, Touch the dear hand, which I admire; My Soul was melting strait away, And dropt before the Fire. This silly Wiseman, who pretends to know, Askt why I look'd so pale, and trembled so? 3 Another from my Mistress' dore Saw me with eyes all watry come; Nor could the hidden cause explore, But thought some smoak was in the room; Such Ign'orance from unwounded Learning came; He knew Tears made by Smoak, but not by Flame. 4 If learn'd in other things you be, And have in Love no skill, For Gods sake keep your arts from me, For I'll be ign'orant still. Study or Action others may embrace; My Love's my Business, and my Books her Face. 5 These are but Trifles, I confess, Which me, weak Mortal, move; Nor is your busie Seriousness Less trifling than my Love. The wisest King who from his sacred brest Pronounc'd all Van'ity, chose it for the best. My Fate. 1 Go bid the Needle his dear North forsake, To which with trembling rev'erence it does bend; Go bid the Stones a journey upwards make; Go bid th' ambitious Flame no more ascend: And when these false to their old Motions prove, Then shall I cease Thee, Thee alone to Love. 2 The fast-link'd Chain of everlasting Fate Does nothing tye more strong, than Me to You; My fixt Love hangs not on your Love or Hate; But will be still the same, what e're you do. You cannot kill my Love with your disdain, Wound it you may, and make it live in pain. 3 Me, mine example let the Stoicks use, Their sad and cruel doctrine to maintain, Let all Prædestinators me produce, Who struggle with eternal bonds in vain. This Fire I'm born to, but 'tis she must tell, Whether't be Beams of Heav'en, or Flames of Hell. 4 You, who mens fortunes in their faces read, To find out mine, look not, alas, on Me; But mark her Face, and all the features heed; For only there is writ my Destiny. Or if Stars shew it, gaze not on the Skies; But study the Astrol'ogy of her Eyes. 5 If thou find there kind and propitious rays, What Mars or Saturn threaten I'll not fear; I well believe the Fate of mortal days Is writ in Heav'en; but, oh my heav'en is there. What can men learn from stars they scarce can see? Two great Lights rule the world; and her two, Me. The Heart-breaking. 1 It gave a piteous groan, and so it broke; In vain it something would have spoke: The Love within too strong for't was, Like Poyson put into a Venice-Glass. 2 I thought that this some Remedy might prove, But, oh, the mighty Serpent Love, Cut by this chance in pieces small, In all still liv'd, and still it stung in all. 3 And now (alas) each little broken part Feels the whole pain of all my Heart: And every smallest corner still Lives with that torment which the Whole did kill. 4 Even so rude Armies when the field they quit, And into several Quarters get; Each Troop does spoil and ruine more, Then all joyn'd in one Body did before. 5 How many Loves raign in my bosom now? How many Loves, yet all of you? Thus have I chang'd with evil fate My Monarch-Love into a Tyrant-State. The Usurpation. 1 Thou hadst to my Soul no title or pretence; I was mine own, and free, Till I had giv'n my self to Thee; But thou hast kept me Slave and Prisoner since. Well, since so insolent thou'rt grown, Fond Tyrant, I'll depose thee from thy Throne; Such outrages must not admitted be In an Elective Monarchy. 2 Part of my Heart by Gift did to Thee fall; My Country, Kindred, and my best Acquaintance were to share the rest; But thou, their Cov'etous Neighbour, drav'est out all: Nay more; thou mak'st me worship Thee, And would'st the rule of my Religion be; Was ever Tyrant claim'd such power as you, To be both Emp'rour, and Pope too? 3 The publick Mise'ries, and my private fate Deserve some tears: but greedy Thou (Insatiate Maid!) wilt not allow That I one drop from thee should alienate. Nor wilt thou grant my sins a part, Though the sole cause of most of them thou art, Counting my Tears thy Tribute and thy Due, Since first mine Eyes I gave to You. 4 Thou all my Joys and all my Hopes dost claim, Thou ragest like a Fire in me, Converting all things into Thee; Nought can resist, or not encrease the Flame. Nay every Grief and every Fear, Thou dost devour, unless thy stamp it bear. Thy presence, like the crowned Basilisks breath, All other Serpents puts to death. 5 As men in Hell are from Diseases free, So from all other ills am I; Free from their known Formality: But all pains Eminently lye in Thee: Alas, alas, I hope in vain My conquer'd Soul from out thine hands to gain. Since all the Natives there thou'st overthrown, And planted Gar'isons of thine own. Maidenhead. 1 Thou worst estate even of the sex that's worst; Therefore by Nature made at first, T'attend the weakness of our birth! Slight, outward Curtain to the Nuptial Bed! Thou Case to buildings not yet finished! Who like the Center of the Earth, Dost heaviest things attract to thee, Though Thou a point imaginary be. 2 A thing God thought for Mankind so unfit, That his first Blessing ruin'd it. Cold forzen Nurse of fiercest fires! Who, like the parched plains of Africks sand, (A steril, and a wild unlovely Land) Art always scortcht with hot desires, Yet barren quite, didst thou not bring Monsters and Serpents forth thy self to sting! 3 Thou that bewitchest men, whilst thou dost dwell Like a close Conj'urer in his Cell! And fear'st the days discovering Eye! No wonder 'tis at all that thou shouldst be Such tedious and unpleasant Company, Who liv'st so Melancholily! Thou thing of subtile, slippery kind, Which Women lose, and yet no Man can find. 4 Although I think thou never found wilt be, Yet I'm resolv'd to search for thee; The search it self rewards the pains. So, though the Chymick his great secret miss, (For neither it in Art nor Nature is) Yet things well worth his toyle he gains: And does his Charge and Labour pay With good unsought exper'iments by the way. 5 Say what thou wilt, Chastity is no more, Thee, than a Porter is his Door. In vain to honour they pretend, Who guard themselves with Ramparts and with Walls, Them only fame the truly valiant calls, Who can an open breach defend. Of thy quick loss can be no doubt, Within so Hated, and so Lov'd without. Impossibilities. 1 Impossibilities? oh no, there's none; Could mine bring thy Heart Captive home; As easi'ly other dangers were o'rethrown, As Cæsar after vanquisht Rome, His little Asian foes did overcome. 2 True Lovers oft by Fortune are envy'd, Oft Earth and Hell against them strive; But Providence engages on their side, And a good end at last does give; At last Just Men and Lovers always thrive. 3 As stars (not powerful else) when they conjoin, Change, as they please, the Worlds estate; So thy Heart in Conjunction with mine, Shall our own fortunes regulate; And to our Stars themselves prescribe a Fate. 4 'Twould grieve me much to find some bold Romance, That should two kind examples shew, Which before us in wonders did advance; Not, that I thought that story true, But none should Fancy more, then I would Do. 5 Through spight of our worst Enemies, thy Friends, Through Local Banishment from Thee; Through the loud thoughts of less-concerning Ends, As easie shall my passage be, As was the Amo'rous Youth's o're Helles Sea. 6 In vain the Winds, in vain the Billows rore; In vain the Stars their aid deny'd: He saw the Sestian Tower on th'other shore; Shall th' Hellespont our Loves divide? No, not th' Atlantick Oceans boundless Tide. 7 Such Seas betwixt us eas'ly conquer'd are; But, gentle Maid, do not deny To let thy Beams shine on me from afar; And still the Taper let me 'espy: For when thy Light goes out, I sink and dye. Silence. 1 Curse on this Tongue, that has my Heart betray'd, And his great Secret open laid! For of all persons chiefly She, Should not the ills I suffer know; Since 'tis a thing might dang'rous grow, Only in Her to Pity Me: Since 'tis for Me to lose my Life more fit, Than 'tis for Her to save and ransome it. 2 Ah, never more shall thy unwilling ear My helpless story hear. Discourse and talk awake does keep The rude unquiet pain, That in my Breast does raign; Silence perhaps may make it sleep: I'll bind that Sore up, I did ill reveal; The Wound, if once it Close, may chance to Heal. 3 No, 'twill ne're heal; my Love will never dye, Though it should speechless lye. A River, e're it meet the Sea, As well might stay its source, As my Love can his course, Unless it join and mix with Thee. If any end or stop of it be found, We know the Flood runs still, though under ground. The Dissembler. 1 Unhurt, untoucht did I complain; And terrifi'd all others with the pain: But now I feel the mighty evil; Ah, there's no fooling with the Devil! So wanton men, whilst others they would fright, Themselves have met a real Spright. 2 I thought, I'll swear, an handsome ly Had been no sin at all in Poetry: But now I suffer an Arrest, For words were spoke by me in jest. Dull, sottish God of Love, and can it be Thou understand'st not Raillery? 3 Darts, and Wounds, and Flame, and Heat, I nam'd but for the Rhime, or the Conceit. Nor meant my Verse should raised be, To this sad fame of Prophesie; Truth gives a dull propriety to my stile, And all the Metaphors does spoil. 4 In things, where Fancy much does reign, 'Tis dangerous too cunningly to feign. The Play at last a Truth does grow, And Custom into Nature go. By this curst art of begging I became Lame, with counterfeiting Lame. 5 My Lines of amorous desire I wrote to kindle and blow others fire: And 'twas a barbarous delight My Fancy promis'd from the sight; But now, by Love, the mighty Phalaris, I My burning Bull the first do try. The Inconstant. 1 I never yet could see that face Which had no dart for me; From fifteen years, to fifties space, They all victorious be. Love thou'rt a Devil; if I may call thee One, For sure in Me thy name is Legion. 2 Colour, or Shape, good Limbs, or Face, Goodness, or Wit in all I find. In Motion or in Speech a grace, If all fail, yet 'tis Woman-kind; And I'm so weak, the Pistol need not be Double, or treble charg'd to murder Me. 3 If Tall, the Name of Proper slays; If Fair, she's pleasant as the Light; If Low, her Prettiness does please; If Black, what Lover loves not Night? If Yellow-hair'd, I Love, lest it should be Th' excuse to others for not loving Me. 4 The Fat, like Plenty, fills my heart; The Lean, with Love makes me too so. If Streight, her Body's Cupid's Dart To me; if Crooked, 'tis his Bow. Nay Age it self does me to rage encline, And strength to Women gives, as well as Wine. 5 Just half as large as Charity My richly-landed Love's become; And judg'd aright is Constancy, Though it take up a larger room: Him, who loves always one, why should they call More Constant, than the Man loves Always All? 6 Thus with unwearied wings I flee Through all Loves Gardens and his Fields; And, like the wise, industrious Bee, No Weed but Honey to me yields! Honey still spent this dil'igence still supplies, Though I return not home with laden Thighs. 7 My Soul at first indeed did prove Of pretty strength against a Dart; Till I this Habit got of Love; But my consum'd and wasted Heart Once burnt to Tinder with a strong Desire, Since that by every Spark is set on Fire. The Constant. 1 Great, and wise Conqu'rour, who where e're Thou com'st, dost fortifie, and settle there! Who canst defend as well as get; And never hadst one Quarter beat up yet; Now thou art in, Thou ne're wilt part With one inch of my vanquisht Heart; For since thou took'st it by assault from Me, 'Tis Garison'd so strong with Thoughts of Thee, It fears no beauteous Enemy. 2 Had thy charming strength been less, I'had serv'd e're this an hundred Mistresses. I'm better thus, nor would compound To leave my Pris'on to be a Vagabound. A Pris'on in which I still would be, Though every door stood ope to Me. In spight both of thy Coldness and thy Pride, All Love is Marriage on thy Lovers side, For only Death can them divide. 3 Close, narrow Chain, yet soft and kind, As that which Spi'rits above to good does bind, Gentle, and sweet Necessity, Which does not force, but guide our Liberty! Your love on Me were spent in vain, Since my Love still could but remain Just as it is; for what, alas can be Added to that which hath Infinity Both in Extent and Quality? Her Name. 1 With more than Jewish Reverence as yet Do I the Sacred Name conceal; When, ye kind Stars, ah when will it be fit This Gentle Mystery to reveal? when will our Love be Nam'd, and we possess That Christning as a Badge of Happiness? 2 So bold as yet no Verse of mine has been, To wear that Gem on any Line; Nor, till the happy Nuptial Muse be seen, Shall any Stanza with it shine. Rest, mighty Name, till then; for thou must be Laid down by Her, e're taken up by Me. 3 Then all the fields and woods shall with it ring; Then Ecchoes burden it shall be; Then all the Birds in sev'eral notes shall sing, And all the Rivers murmur Thee; Then ev'ery wind the Sound shall upwards bear, And softly whisper't to some Angels Ear. 4 Then shall thy Name through all my Verse be spread, Thick as the flowers in Meadows lye, And, when in future times they shall be read, (As sure, I think, they will not dye) If any Critick doubt that They be mine, Men by that Stamp shall quickly know the Coyn. 5 Mean while I will not dare to make a Name To represent thee by; Adam (Gods Nomenclator) could not frame One that enough should signifie. Astræa or Cælia as unfit would prove For Thee, as 'tis to call the Deity, Jove. Weeping. 1 See where she sits, and in what comely wise, Drops Tears more fair then others Eyes! Ah, charming Maid, let not ill Fortune see Th'attire thy sorrow wears, Nor know the beauty of thy Tears: For shee'l still come to dress her self in Thee. 2 As stars reflect on waters, so I spy In every drop (methinks) her Eye. The Baby, which lives there, and alwayes plays In that illustrious sphære, Like a Narcissus does appear, Whilst in his flood the lovely Boy did gaze. 3 Ne're yet did I behold so glorious weather, As this Sun-shine and Rain together. Pray Heav'en her Forehead, that pure Hill of snow, (For some such Fountain we must find, To waters of so fair a kind) Melt not, to feed that beauteous stream below. 4 Ah, mighty Love, that it were inward Heat Which made this precious Limbeck sweat! But what, alas, ah what does it avail That she weeps Tears so wondrous cold, As scarce the Asses hoof can hold, So cold, that I admire they fall not Hail. Discretion. 1 Discreet? what means this word Discreet? A Curse on all Discretion! This barbarous term you will not meet In all Loves-Lexicon. 2 Joynture, Portion, Gold, Estate, Houses, Houshold-stuff, or Land, (The Low Conveniences of Fate) Are Greek no Lovers understand. 3 Believe me, beauteous one, when Love Enters into a brest, The two first things it does remove, Are Friends and Interest. 4 Passion's half blind, nor can endure The careful, scrup'lous Eyes, Or else I could not love, I'm sure, One who in Love were wise. 5 Men, in such tempests tost about, Will without grief or pain, Cast all their goods and riches out, Themselves their Port to gain. 6 As well might Martyrs, who do choose, That sacred Death to take, Mourn for the Clothes which they must lose, When they're bound naked to the Stake. The Waiting-Maid. 1. Thy Maid? ah, find some nobler theame Whereon thy doubts to place; Nor by a low suspect blaspheme The glories of thy face. 2. Alas, she makes Thee shine so fair, So exquisitely bright, That her dim Lamp must disappear Before thy potent Light. 3. Three hours each morn in dressing Thee, Maliciously are spent; And make that Beauty Tyranny, That's else a Civil Government. 4. The'adorning thee with so much art, Is but a barb'arous skill; 'Tis like the poys'oning of a Dart Too apt before to kill. 5. The Min'istring Angels none can see; 'Tis not their beauty'or face, For which by men they worshipt be; But their high Office and their place. Thou art my Goddess, my Saint, She; I pray to Her, only to pray to Thee. Counsel. 1 Ah! what advice can I receive? No, satisfie me first; For who would Physick-potions give To one that dyes with Thirst? 2 A little puff of breath we find, Small fires can quench and kill; But when they're great, the adverse wind Does make them greater still. 3 Now whilst you speak, it moves me much; But strait I'm just the same; Alas, th'effect must needs be such Of Cutting through a Flame. The Cure. 1. Come, Doctor, use thy roughest art, Thou canst not cruel prove; Cut, burn, and torture every part, To heal me of my Love. 2. There is no danger, if the pain Should me to 'a Feaver bring; Compar'd with Heats I now sustain, A Feaver is so Cool a thing, (Like drink which feaverish men desire) That I should hope 'twould almost quench my Fire. The Separation. 1 Ask me not what my Love shall do or be (Love which is Soul to Body, and Soul of Me) When I am sep'arated from thee; Alas, I might as easily show, What after Death the Soul will do; 'Twill last, I'm sure, and that is all we know. 2 The thing call'd Soul will never stir nor move, But all that while a liveless Carkass prove, For 'tis the Body of my Love; Not that my Love will fly away, But still continue, as, they say, Sad troubled Ghosts about their Graves do stray. The Tree. 1 I chose the flouri'shingst Tree in all the Park, With freshest Boughs, and fairest head; I cut my Love into his gentle Bark, And in three days, behold, 'tis dead; My very written flames so vi'olent be They'have burnt and wither'd up the Tree: 2 How should I live my self, whose Heart is found Deeply graven every where With the large History of many a wound, Larger than thy Trunk can bear? With art as strange, as Homer in the Nut, Love in my Heart has Volumes put. 3 What a few words from thy rich stock did take The Leaves and Beauties all? As a strong Poyson with one drop does make The Nails and Hairs to fall: Love (I see now) a kind of Witchcraft is, Or Characters could ne're do this. 4 Pardon ye Birds and Nymphs who lov'd this Shade; And pardon me, thou gentle Tree; I thought her name would thee have happy made, And blessed Omens hop'd from Thee; Notes of my Love, thrive here (said I) and grow; And with ye let my Love do so. 5 Alas poor youth, thy love will never thrive! This blasted Tree Predestines it; Go tye the dismal Knot (why shouldst thou live?) And by the Lines thou there hast writ Deform'dly hanging, the sad Picture be To that unlucky History. Her Unbelief. 1 'Tis a strange kind of Ign'orance this in you! That you your Victories should not spy, Victories gotten by your Eye! That your bright Beams, as those of Comets do, Should kill, but not know How, nor Who. 2 That truly you my Idol might appear, Whilst all the People smell and see The odorous flames, I offer thee, Thou sit'st, and dost not see, nor smell, nor hear Thy constant zealous worshipper. 3 They see't too well who at my fires repine, Nay th' unconcern'd themselves do prove Quick-Ey'd enough to spy my Love; Nor does the Cause in thy Face clearlier shine, Then the Effect appears in mine. 4 Fair Infidel! by what unjust decree Must I, who with such restless care Would make this truth to thee appear, Must I, who preach it, and pray for it, be Damn'd by thy incredulitie? 5 I by thy Unbelief am guiltless slain; O have but Faith, and then that you May know that Faith for to be true, It shall it self by 'a Miracle maintain, And raise me from the Dead again. 6 Mean while my Hopes may seem to be o'rethrown; But Lovers Hopes are full of Art, And thus dispute, that since my heart Though in thy Breast, yet is not by thee known, Perhaps thou may'st not know thine Own. The Gazers. 1 Come let's go on, where Love and Youth does call; I've seen too much, if this be all. Alas, how far more wealthy might I be With a contented Ign'orant Povertie? To shew such stores, and nothing grant, Is to enrage and vex my want. For Love to Dye an Infant's lesser ill, Than to live long, yet live in Child-hood still. 2 We'have both sate gazing only hitherto, As Man and Wife in Picture do. The richest crop of Joy is still behind, And He who only Sees, in Love is Blind. So at first Pigmalion lov'd. But th'Amour at last improv'd: The Statue'it self at last a woman grew, And so at last, my Dear, should you do too. 3 Beauty to man the greatest Torture is, Unless it lead to farther bliss Beyond the tyran'ous pleasures of the Eye. It grows too serious a Crueltie, Unless it Heal, as well as strike; I would not, Salamander-like, In scortching heats always to Live desire, But like a Martyr, pass to Heav'en through Fire. 4 Mark how the lusty Sun salutes the Spring, And gently kisses every thing. His loving Beams unlock each maiden flower, Search all the Treasures, all the Sweets devour: Then on the earth with Bridegroom-Heat, He does still new Flowers beget. The Sun himself, although all Eye he be, Can find in Love more Pleasure than to see. The Incurable. 1 I try'd if Books would cure my Love, but found Love made them Non-sense all. I'apply'd Receipts of Business to my wound, But stirring did the pain recall. 2 As well might men who in a Feaver fry, Mathematique doubts debate, As well might men, who mad in darkness ly, Write the Dispatches of a State. 3 I try'd Devotion, Sermons, frequent Prayer, But those did worse than useless prove; For Pray'rs are turn'd to Sin in those who are Out of Charity, or in Love. 4 I try'd in Wine to drown the mighty care; But Wine, alas, was Oyl to th' fire. Like Drunkards eyes, my troubled Fancy there Did double the Desire. 5 I try'd what Mirth and Gayety would do, And mixt with pleasant Companies; My Mirth did graceless and insipid grow, And 'bove a Clinch it could not rise. 6 Nay, God forgive me for't, at last I try'd 'Gainst this some new desire to stir, And lov'd again, but 'twas where I espy'd Some faint Resemblances of Her. 7 The Physick made me worse with which I strove This Mortal Ill t'expell, As wholesome Med'icines the Disease improve, There where they work not well. Honour. 1 She Loves, and she confesses too; There's then at last, no more to do. The happy work's entirely done; Enter the Town which thou hast won; The Fruits of Conquest now begin; Iô Triumph! Enter in. 2 What's this, ye Gods, what can it be? Remains there still an Enemie? Bold Honour stands up in the Gate, And would yet Capitulate; Have I o'recome all real foes, And shall this Phantome me oppose? 3 Noisy Nothing! stalking Shade! By what Witchcraft wert thou made? Empty cause of Solid harms! But I shall find out Counter-charms Thy airy Devi'lship to remove From this Circle here of Love. 4 Sure I shall rid my self of Thee By the Nights obscurity, And obscurer secresie. Unlike to every other spright, Thou attempt'st not men t'affright, Nor appear'st but in the Light. The Innocent Ill. 1 Though all thy gestures and discourses be Coyn'd and stamp't by Modestie, Though from thy Tongue ne're slipt away One word which Nuns at th' Altar might not say, Yet such a sweetness, such a grace In all thy speech appear, That what to th' Eye a beauteous face, That thy Tongue is to th' Ear. So cunningly it wounds the heart, It strikes such heat through every part, That thou a Tempter worse than Satan art. 2 Though in thy thoughts scarce any Tracks have bin So much as of Original Sin, Such charms thy Beauty wears as might Desires in dying confest Saints excite. Thou with strange Adulterie Dost in each breast a Brothel keep; Awake all men do lust for thee, And some enjoy Thee when they sleep. Ne're before did Woman live, Who to such Multitudes did give The Root and cause of Sin, but only Eve. 3 Though in thy breast so quick a Pity be, That a Flies Death's a wound to thee. Though savage, and rock-hearted those Appear, that weep not ev'en Romances woes. Yet ne're before was Tyrant known, Whose rage was of so large extent, The ills thou dost are whole thine own, Thou'rt Principal and Instrument, In all the deaths that come from you, You do the treble Office do Of Judge, of Tort'urer, and of Weapon too. 4 Thou lovely Instrument of angry Fate, Which God did for our faults create! Thou Pleasant, Universal Ill, Which sweet as Health, yet like a Plague dost kill! Thou kind, well-natur'ed Tyrannie! Thou chast committer of a Rape! Thou voluntary Destinie, Which no man Can, or Would escape! So gentle, and so glad to spare, So wondrous good, and wondrous fair, (We know) e'ven the Destroying Angels are. DIALOGUE. She. What have we done? what cruel passion mov'd thee, Thus to ruine her that lov'd Thee? Me thou'hast robb'ed, but what art thou Thy Self the richer now? Shame succeeds the short-liv'd pleasure; So soon is spent, and gone, this thy Ill-gotten Treasure. He. We'have done no harm; nor was it Theft in me, But noblest Charity in Thee. I'll the well-gotten Pleasure Safe in my Mem'ory Treasure; What though the Flower it self do wast, The Essence from it drawn does long and sweeter last. She. No: I'm undone; my Honour Thou hast slain, And nothing can restore't again. Art and Labour to bestow, Upon the Carcase of it now, Is but t'embalm a body dead, The Figure may remain, the Life and Beauty's fled. He. Never, my dear, was Honour yet undone, By Love, but Indiscretion. To th' wise it all things does allow; And cares not What we do; but How. Like Tapers shut in ancient Urns, Unless it let in air, for ever shines and burns. She. Thou first perhaps who didst the fault commit, Wilt make thy wicked boast of it. For Men, with Roman pride, above The Conquest, do the Triumph love: Nor think a perfect Victo'ry gain'd, Unless they through the streets their Captive lead enchain'd. [He.] Who e're his secret joys has open laid, The Baud to his own Wife is made. Beside what boast is left for me, Whose whole wealth's a Gift from Thee? 'Tis you the Conqu'erour are, 'tis you Who have not only ta'ne, but bound, and gag'd me too. [She.] Though publick pun'ishment we escape, the Sin Will rack and torture us within: Guilt and Sin our bosom bears; And though fair, yet the Fruit appears, That Worm which now the Core does wast, When long t'has gnaw'd within will break the skin at last. [He.] That Thirsty Drink, that Hungry Food I sought, That wounded Balm, is all my fault. And thou in pity didst apply, The kind and only remedy: The Cause absolves the Crime; since Me So mighty Force did move, so mighty Goodness Thee. [She.] Curse on thine Arts! methinks I Hate thee now; And yet I'm sure I love Thee too! I'm angry, but my wrath will prove, More Innocent than did thy Love. Thou hast this day undone me quite; Yet wilt undo me more should'st thou not come at night. Verses lost upon a Wager. 1 As soon hereafter will I wagers lay, 'Gainst what an Oracle shall say, Fool, that I was, to venture to deny A Tongue so us'd to Victory! A Tongue so blest by Nature and by Art, That never yet it spoke but gain'd an Heart: Though what you said, had not been true If spoke by any else but you. Your speech will govern Destiny, And Fate will change rather than you should Ly. 2 'Tis true if Humane Reason were the Guide, Reason, methinks, was on my side, But that's a Guide, alas, we must resign, When th' Authority's Divine. She said, she said her self it would be so; And I, bold unbeliever, answer'd No, Never so justly sure before Errour the name of Blindness bore, For whatsoe're the Question be, There's no man that has eyes would bet for Me. 3 If Truth it self (as other Angels do When they descend to humane view) In a Material Form would daign to shine, 'Twould imitate or borrow Thine, So daz'eling bright, yet so transparent clear, So well proportion'd would the parts appear; Happy the eye which Truth could see Cloath'd in a shape like Thee, But happier far the eye Which could thy shape naked like Truth espy! 4 Yet this lost wager costs me nothing more Than what I ow'ed to thee before. Who would not venture for that debt to play Which He were bound howe're to pay? If Nature gave me power to write in verse, She gave it me thy praises to reherse. Thy wondrous Beauty and Thy Wit Has such a Sov'ereign Right to it, That no Mans Muse for publique vent is free, Till she has paid her Customs first to Thee. Bathing in the River. 1 The fish around her crowded, as they do To the false light that treach'erous Fishers shew, And all with as much ease might taken be, As she at first took me. For ne're did Light so clear Among the waves appear, Though ev'ery night the Sun himself set there. 2 Why to Mute Fish should'st thou thy self discover, And not to me thy no less silent Lover? As some from Men their buried Gold commit To Ghosts that have no use of it! Half their rich treasures so Maids bury; and for ought we know (Poor Ignorants) they're Mermaids all below. 3 The amo'rous Waves would fain about her stay, But still new am'orous waves drive them away, And with swift current to those joys they haste, That do as swiftly waste, I laught the wanton play to view, But 'tis, alas, at Land so too, And still old Lovers yield the place to new. 4 Kiss her, and as you part, you am'orous Waves (My happier Rivals, and my fellow slaves) Point to your flowry banks, and to her shew The good your Bounties do; Then tell her what your Pride doth cost, And, how your use and beauty's lost, When rig'orous Winter binds you up with Frost. 5 Tell her, her Beauties and her Youth, like Thee Haste without stop to a devouring Sea; Where they will mixt and undistinguisht ly With all the meanest things that dy. As in the Ocean Thou No priviledge dost know Above th' impurest streams that thither flow. 6 Tell her, kind flood, when this has made her sad, Tell her there's yet one Rem'edy to be had; Shew her how thou, though long since past, dost find Thy self yet still behind, Marriage (say to her) will bring About the self-same thing, But she, fond Maid, shuts and seals up the spring. Love given over. 1 It is enough; of time, and pain Hast thou consum'd in vain; Leave, wretched Cowley, leave Thy self with shadows to deceive; Think that already lost which thou must never gain. 2 Three of thy lustiest and thy freshest years, (Tost in storms of Hopes and Fears) Like helpless Ships that be Set on fire i'th' midst o'the Sea, Have all been burnt in Love, and all been drown'd in Tears. 3 Resolve then on it, and by force or art Free thy unlucky Heart; Since Fate does disapprove Th' ambition of thy Love. And not one Star in heav'n offers to take thy part. 4 If e're I clear my Heart from this desire, If e're it home to its breast retire, It ne're shall wander more about, Though thousand beauties call'd it out: A Lover Burnt like me for ever dreads the fire. 5 The Pox, the Plague, and ev'ry small disease, May come as oft as ill Fate please; But Death and Love are never found To give a Second Wound, We're by those Serpents bit, but we're devour'd by these. 6 Alas, what comfort is't that I am grown Secure of be'ing again o'rethrown? Since such an Enemy needs not fear Lest any else should quarter there, Who has not only Sack't, but quite burnt down the Town. FINIS. Pindarique ODES, Written in Imitation of the STILE &amp; MANNER OF THE ODES OF PINDAR. Hor. Ep. L. 1. 3. Pindarici fontis qui non expalluit haustus. THE SECOND Olympique Ode OF PINDAR. Written in praise of Theron Prince of Agrigentum (a famous City in Sicily built by his Ancestors) who in the seventy seventh Olympique won the Chariot-prize. He is commended from the Nobility of his Race (whose story is often toucht on) from his great Riches (an ordinary Common-Place in Pindar) from his Hospitality, Munificence, and other Virtues. The Ode (according to the constant custom of the Poet) consists more in Digressions, than in the main subject: And the Reader must not be chocqued to hear him speak so often of his own Muse; for that is a Liberty which this kind of Poetry can hardly live without. 1. Queen of all Harmonious things, Dancing Words, and Speaking Strings, What God, what Hero wilt thou sing? What happy Man to equal glories bring? Begin, begin thy noble choice, And let the Hills around reflect the Image of thy Voice. Pisa does to Jove belong, Jove and Pisa claim thy Song. The fair First-fruits of War, th'Olympique Games, Alcides offered up to Jove; Alcides too thy strings may move; But, oh, what Man to join with these can worthy prove! Join Theron boldly to their sacred Names; Theron the next honour claims; Theron to no man gives place, Is first in Pisa's, and in Virtue's Race; Theron there, and he alone, Ev'n his own swift Forefathers has outgone. 2. They through rough ways, o're many stops they past, Till on the fatal bank at last They Agrigentum built, the beauteous Eye Of fair-fac'ed Sicilie, Which does it self i'th' River by With Pride and Joy espy. Then chearful Notes their Painted Years did sing, And Wealth was one, and Honour th' other Wing. Their genuine Virtues did more sweet and clear, In Fortunes graceful dress appear. To which great Son of Rhea, say The Firm Word which forbids things to Decay. If in Olympus Top, where Thou Sit'st to behold thy Sacred Show, If in Alpheus silver flight, If in my Verse thou dost delight, My Verse, O Rhea's Son, which is Lofty as that, and smooth as This. 3. For the past sufferings of this noble Race (Since things once past, and fled out of thine hand, Hearken no more to thy command) Let present joys fill up their place, And with Oblivions silent stroke deface Of foregone Ills the very trace. In no illustrious line Do these happy changes shine More brightly Theron than in thine. So in the Chrystal Palaces Of the blew-ey'd Nereides Ino her endless youth does please, And thanks her fall into the Seas. Beauteous Semele does no less Her cruel Midwife Thunder bless, Whilst sporting with the Gods on high, She' enjoys secure their Company, Plays with Lightnings as they fly, Nor trembles at the bright Embraces of the Deity. 4. But Death did them from future dangers free, What God (alas) will Caution be For Living Mans securitie, Or will ensure our Vessel in this faithless Sea? Never did the Sun as yet So healthful a fair day beget, That Travelling Mortals might rely on it. But Fortunes favour and her Spight Rowl with alternate Waves like Day and Night. Vicissitudes which thy great race pursue, Ere since the fatal Son his Father slew, And did old Oracles fulfill Of Gods that cannot Lye, for they foretel but their own Will 5. Erynnis saw't, and made in her own seed The innocent Parricide to bleed, She slew his wrathful Sons with mutual blows; But better things did then succeed, And brave Thersander in amends for what was past arose. Brave Thersander was by none In war, or warlike sports out-done. Thou Theron his great virtues dost revive, He in my Verse and Thee again does live. Loud Olympus happy Thee, Isthmus and Nemea does twice happy see. For the well-natur'ed honour there Which with thy Brother thou didst share, Was to thee double grown By not being all thine Own. And those kind pious glories do deface The old Fraternal quarrel of thy Race. 6. Greatness of Mind and Fortune too The' Olympique Trophees shew. Both their several parts must do In the noble Chase of Fame, This without that is Blind, that without this is Lame. Nor is fair Virtues Picture seen aright But in Fortunes golden light. Riches alone are of uncertain date, And on short-Man long cannot wait. The Vertuous make of them the best, And put them out to Fame for Interest. With a frail good they wisely buy The solid Purchase of Eternity. They whilst Lifes air they breath, consider well and know Th'account they must hereafter give below. Whereas th'unjust and Covetous above, In deep unlovely vaults, By the just decrees of Jove Unrelenting torments prove, The heavy Necessary effects of Voluntary Faults. 7. Whilst in the Lands of unexhausted Light O're which the God-like Suns unwearied sight, Ne're winks in Clouds, or Sleeps in Night, An endless Spring of Age the Good enjoy, Where neither Want does pinch, nor Plenty cloy. There neither Earth nor Sea they plow, Nor ought to Labour ow For Food, that whil'st it nour'ishes does decay, And in the Lamp of Life consumes away. Thrice had these men through mortal bodies past, Did thrice the tryal undergo, Till all their little Dross was purg'd at last, The Furnace had no more to do. Then in rich Saturns peaceful state Were they for sacred Treasures plac'ed, The Muse-discovered World of Islands Fortunate. 8. Soft-footed Winds with tuneful voyces there Dance through the perfum'd Air. There Silver Rivers through enamell'd Meadows glide, And golden Trees enrich their side. Th'illustrious Leaves no dropping Autumn fear, And Jewels for their fruit they bear. Which by the Blest are gathered For Bracelets to the Arm, and Garlands to the Head. Here all the Hero's, and their Poets live, Wise Rhadamanthus did the Sentence give, Who for his justice was thought fit With Soveraign Saturn on the Bench to sit. Peleus here, and Cadmus reign, Here great Achilles wrathful now no more, Since his blest Mother (who before Had try'd it on his Body' in vain) Dipt now his Soul in Stygian Lake, Which did from thence a divine Hardness take, That does from Passion and from Vice Invulnerable make. 9. To Theron, Muse, bring back thy wandring Song, Whom those bright Troops expect impatiently; And may they do so long. How, noble Archer, do thy wanton Arrows fly At all the Game that does but cross thine Eye? Shoot, and spare not, for I see Thy sounding Quiver can ne're emptied be; Let Art use Method and good Husbandry, Art lives on Natures Alms, is weak and poor; Nature herself has unexhausted store, Wallows in Wealth, and runs a turning Maze, That no vulgar Eye can trace. Art instead of mounting high, About her humble Food does hov'ering fly, Like the ignoble Crow, rapine and noise does love, Whilst Nature, like the sacred Bird of Jove, Now bears loud Thunder, and anon with silent joy The beauteous Phrygian Boy, Defeats the Strong, o'retakes the Flying prey; And sometimes basks in th'open Flames of Day, And sometimes too he shrowds, His soaring wings among the Clouds. 10. Leave, wanton Muse, thy roving flight, To thy loud String the well-fletcht Arrow put, Let [A]grigentum be the But, And Theron be the White. And lest the Name of Verse should give Malitious men pretext to misbelieve, By the Castalian waters swear, (A sacred Oath no Poets dare To take in vain, No more then Gods do that of Styx prophane) Swear in no City e're before, A better man, or greater-soul'd was born, Swear that Theron sure has sworn No man near him should be poor. Swear that none e're had such a graceful art, Fortunes free gifts as freely to impart With an Unenvious band, and an unbounded Heart. 11. But in this thankless world the Givers Are envi'ed ev'en by the Receivers. 'Tis now the cheap and frugal fashion, Rather to Hide then Pay the Obligation. Nay 'tis much worse than so, It now an Artifice does grow, Wrongs and outrages to do, Lest men should think we ow. Such Monsters, Theron, has thy Vertue found, But all the malice they profess, Thy secure Honour cannot wound: For thy vast Bounties are so numberless, That them or to Conceal, or else to Tell, Is equally Impossible. THE FIRST Nemeæan Ode OF PINDAR. Chromius, the Son of Agesidamus, a young Gentleman of Sicilie, is celebrated for having won the prize of the Chariot-Race in the Nemeæan Games (a Solemnity instituted first to celebrate the Funeral of Opheltes, as is at large described by Statius; and afterwards continued every third year, with an extraordinary conflux of all Greece, and with incredible honor to the Conquerors in all the exercises there practised) upon which occasion, the Poet begins with the commendation of his Country, which I take to have been Ortygia (an Island belonging to Sicilie, and a part of Syracuse, being joyned to it by a Bridg) though the title of the Ode call him Ætnæan Chromius, perhaps because he was made Governour of that Town by Hieron. From thence he falls into the praise of Chromius his person, which he draws from his great end[ow]ments of Mind and Body, and most especially from his Hospitality, and the worthy use of his riches. He likens his beginning to that of Hercules, and according to his usual manner of being transported with any good Hint that meets him in his way, passing into a Digression of Hercules, and his slaying the two Serpents in his Cradle, concludes the Ode with that History. 1. Beauteous Ortygia, the first breathing place Of great Alpheus close and amorous race, Fair Delos Sister, the Child-Bed Of bright Latona, where she bred The Original New-Moon, Who saw'st her tender Forehead e're the Horns were grown. Who like a gentle Scion, newly started out, From Syracusa's side dost sprout. Thee first my Song does greet With numbers smooth and fleet, As thine own Horses airy feet, When they young Chromius Chariot drew, And o're the Nemeæan race triumphant flew. Jove will approve my Song and Me, Jove is concern'd in Nemea, and in Thee. 2. With Jove, my Song; this happy man, Young Chromius too with Jove began; From hence came his success, Nor ought he therefore like it less, Since the best Fame is that of Happiness. For whom should we esteem above The Men whom Gods do love. 'Tis them alone the Muse too does approve. Lo how it makes this victory shine O're all the fruitful Isle of Proserpine! The Torches which the Mother brought When the ravisht Maid she sought, Appear'd not half so bright, But cast a weaker light, Through earth, and ayr, and Seas, and up to th'heavenly Vault. 3. To thee, O Proserpine, this Isle I give, Said Jove, and as he said, Smil'd, and bent his gracious Head. And thou, O Isle, said he, for ever thrive, And keep the value of our Gift alive. As Heaven with Stars, so let The Countrey thick with Towns be set, And numberless as Stars Let all the Towns be then Replenish'd thick with Men, Wise in Peace, and Bold in Wars. Of thousand glorious Towns the Nation, Of thousand glorious Men each Town a Constellation. Nor let their warlike Lawrel scorn, With the Olympique Olive to be worn, Whose gentler Honors do so well the Brows of Peace adorn. 4. Go to great Syracuse, my Muse, and wait At Chromius Hospitable Gate. 'Twill open wide to let thee in, When thy Lyres voyce shall but begin. Joy, Plenty, and free Welcome dwells within. The Tyrian Beds thou shalt find ready drest, The Ivory Table crowded with a Feast. The Table which is free for every Guest, No doubt will thee admit, And feast more upon Thee, then Thou on it. Chromius and Thou art met aright, For as by Nature thou dost Write, So he by Nature Loves, and does by Nature Fight. 5. Nature herself, whilst in the womb he was, Sow'd Strength and Beauty through the forming Mass, They mov'ed the vital Lump in every part, And carv'ed the Members out with wondrous art. She fill'd his Mind with Courage, and with Wit, And a vast Bounty, apt and fit For the great Dowre which Fortune made to it. 'Tis Madness sure Treasures to hoord, And make them useless, as in Mines, remain, To lose th' Occasion Fortune does afford Fame, and publick Love to gain. Even for self-concerning ends, 'Tis wiser much to hoord up Friends. Though Happy men the present goods possess, Th' Unhappy have their share in future Hopes no less. 6. How early has young Chromius begun The Race of Virtue, and how swiftly run, And born the noble Prize away, Whilst other youths yet at the Barriere stay? None but Alcides e're set earlier forth then He; The God, his Fathers, Blood nought could restrain, 'Twas ripe at first, and did disdain The slow advance of dull Humanitie, The big-limm'ed Babe in his huge Cradle lay, Too weighty to be rockt by Nurses hands, Wrapt in purple swadling-bands. When, Lo, by jealous Juno's fierce commands, Two dreadful Serpents come Rowling and hissing loud into the roome. To the bold Babe they trace their bidden way, Forth from their flaming eyes dread Lightnings went, Their gaping Mouths did forked Tongues like Thunderbolts present. 7. Some of th' amazed Women dropt down dead With fear, some wildly fled About the room, some into corners crept, Where silently they shook and wept. All naked from her bed the passionate Mother lept To save or perish with her Child, She trembled, and she cry'ed, the mighty Infant smil'd. The mighty Infant seem'd well pleas'd At his gay gilded foes, And as their spotted necks up to the Cradle rose, With his young warlike hands on both he seis'd; In vain they rag'd, in vain they hist, In vain their armed Tails they twist, And angry Circles cast about, Black Blood, and fiery Breath, and poys'nous Soul he squeezes out. 8. With their drawn Swords In ran Amphitryo, and the Theban Lords, With doubting Wonder, and with troubled joy They saw the conquering Boy Laugh, and point downwards to his prey, Where in deaths pangs, and their own gore they folding lay. When wise Tiresias this beginning knew, He told with ease the things t'ensue, From what Monsters he should free The Earth, the Ayr, and Sea, What mighty Tyrants he should slay, Greater Monsters far then They. How much at Phlægras field the distrest Gods should ow To their great Off-spring here below, And how his Club should there outdo, Apollos silver Bow, and his own Fathers Thunder too. 9. And that the grateful Gods at last, The race of his laborious Virtue past, Heaven, which he sav'ed, should to him give, Where marry'd to eternal Youth he should for ever live; Drink Nectar with the Gods, and all his senses please In their harmonious golden Palaces. Walk with ineffable Delight Through the thick Groves of never-withering Light, And as he walks affright The Lyon and the Bear, Bull, Centaur, Scorpion, all the radiant Monsters there. The Praise of Pindar. In Imitation of Horace his second Ode, B. 4. Pindarum quisquis studet æmulari, &amp;c. 1. Pindar is imitable by none; The Phœnix Pindar is a vast Species alone. Who e're but Dædalus with waxen wings could fly And neither sink too low, nor soar too high? What could he who follow'd claim, But of vain boldness the unhappy fame, And by his fall a Sea to name? Pindars unnavigable Song Like a swoln Flood from some steep Mountain pours along, The Ocean meets with such a Voice From his enlarged Mouth, as drowns the Oceans noise. 2. So Pindar does new Words and Figures roul Down his impetuous Dithyrambique Tide, Which in no Channel deigns t'abide, Which neither Banks nor Dikes controul. Whether th' Immortal Gods he sings In a no less Immortal strain, Or the great Acts of God-descended Kings, Who in his Numbers still survive and Reign. Each rich embroidered Line, Which their triumphant Brows around, By his sacred Hand is bound, Does all their starry Diadems outshine. 3. Whether at Pisa's race he please To carve in polisht Verse the Conque'rors Images, Whether the Swift, the Skilful, or the Strong, Be crowned in his Nimble, Artful, Vigorous Song: Whether some brave young man's untimely fate In words worth Dying for he celebrate, Such mournful, and such pleasing words, As joy to'his Mothers and his Mistress grief affords: He bids him Live and Grow in fame, Among the Stars he sticks his Name: The Grave can but the Dross of him devour, So small is Deaths, so great the Poets power. 4. Lo, how th'obsequious Wind, and swelling Ayr The Theban Swan does upwards bear Into the walks of Clouds, where he does play, And with extended Wings opens his liquid way. Whilst, alas, my tim'erous Muse Unambitious tracks pursues; Does with weak unballast wings, About the mossy Brooks and Springs; About the Trees new-blossom'ed Heads, About the Gardens painted Beds, About the Fields and flowry Meads, And all inferior beauteous things Like the laborious Bee, For little drops of Honey flee, And there with Humble Sweets contents her Industrie. The Resurrection. 1. Not Winds to Voyagers at Sea, Nor Showers to Earth more necessary be, (Heav'ens vital seed cast on the womb of Earth To give the fruitful Year a Birth) Then Verse to Virtue, which can do The Midwifes Office, and the Nurses too; It feeds it strongly, and it cloathes it gay, And when it dyes, with comely pride Embalms it, and erects a Pyramide That never will decay Till Heaven it self shall melt away, And nought behind it stay. 2. Begin the Song, and strike the Living Lyre; Lo how the Years to come, a numerous and well-fitted Quire, All hand in hand do decently advance, And to my Song with smooth and equal measures dance. Whilst the dance lasts, how long so e're it be, My Musicks voyce shall bear it companie. Till all gentle Notes be drown'd In the last Trumpets dreadful sound. That to the Spheres themselves shall silence bring, Untune the Universal String. Then all the wide extended Sky, And all th'harmonious Worlds on high, And Virgils sacred work shall dy. And he himself shall see in one Fire shine Rich Natures ancient Troy, though built by Hands Divine. 3. Whom Thunders dismal noise, And all that Prophets and Apostles louder spake, And all the Creatures plain conspiring voyce, Could not whilst they liv'ed, awake, This mightier sound shall make When Dead t'arise, And open Tombs, and open Eyes To the long Sluggards of five thousand years. This mightier Sound shall make its Hearers Ears. Then shall the scatter'ed Atomes crowding come Back to their Ancient Home, Some from Birds, from Fishes some, Some from Earth, and some from Seas, Some from Beasts, and some from Trees. Some descend from Clouds on high, Some from Metals upwards fly, And where th'attending Soul naked, and shivering stands, Meet, salute, and joyn their hands. As disperst Souldiers at the Trumpets call, Hast to their Colours all. Unhappy most, like Tortur'ed Men, Their Joynts new set, to be new rackt agen. To Mountains they for shelter pray, The Mountains shake, and run about no less confus'd then They. 4. Stop, stop, my Muse, allay thy vig'orous heat, Kindled at a Hint so Great. Hold thy Pindarique Pegasus closely in, Which does to rage begin, And this steep Hill would gallop up with violent course, 'Tis an unruly, and a hard-Mouth'd Horse, Fierce, and unbroken yet, Impatient of the Spur or Bit. Now praunces stately, and anon flies o're the place, Disdains the servile Law of any settled pace, Conscious and proud of his own natural force. 'Twill no unskilful Touch endure, But flings Writer and Reader too that sits not sure. The Muse. 1. Go, the rich Chariot instantly prepare; The Queen, my Muse, will take the air; Unruly Phansie with strong Judgment trace, Put in nimble-footed Wit, Smooth-pac'ed Eloquence joyn with it, Sound Memory with young Invention place, Harness all the winged race. Let the Postillion Nature mount, and let The Coachman Art be set. And let the airy Footmen running all beside, Make a long row of goodly pride. Figures, Conceits, Raptures, and Sentences In a well-worded dress. And innocent Loves, and pleasant Truths, and useful Lies, In all their gaudy Liveries. Mount, glorious Queen, thy travelling Throne, And bid it to put on; For long, though cheerful, is the way, And Life, alas, allows but one ill winters Day. 2. Where never Foot of Man, or Hoof of Beast, The passage prest, Where never Fish did fly, And with short silver wings cut the low liquid Sky. Where Bird with painted Oars did nere Row through the trackless Ocean of the Air. Where never yet did pry The busie Mornings curious Ey: The Wheels of thy bold Coach pass quick and free; And all's an open Road to Thee. Whatever God did Say, Is all thy plain and smooth, uninterrupted way. Nay ev'n beyond his works thy Voyages are known, Thou 'hast thousand worlds too of thine own. Thou speakst, great Queen, in the same stile as He, And a New world leaps forth when Thou say'st, Let it Be. 3. Thou fadom'est the deep Gulf of Ages past, And canst pluck up with ease The years which Thou dost please, Like shipwrackt Treasures by rude Tempests cast Long since into the Sea, Brought up again to light and publique Use by Thee. Nor dost thou only Dive so low, But Fly With an unwearied Wing the other way on high, Where Fates among the Stars do grow; There into the close Nests of Time do'st peep, And there with piercing Eye, Through the firm shell, and the thick White do'st spie, Years to come a forming lie, Close in their sacred Secondine asleep, Till hatcht by the Suns vital heat Which o're them yet does brooding set They Life and Motion get, And ripe at last with vigorous might Break through the Shell, and take their everlasting Flight. 4. And sure we may The same too of the Present say, If Past, and Future Times do thee obey. Thou stopst this Current, and dost make This running River settle like a Lake, Thy certain hand holds fast this slippery Snake. The Fruit which does so quickly wast, Men scarce can see it, much less tast, Thou Comfitest in Sweets to make it last. This shining piece of Ice Which melts so soon away With the Suns ray, Thy Verse does solidate and Chrystallize, Till it a lasting Mirror be. Nay thy Immortal Rhyme Makes this one short Point of Time, To fill up half the Orb of Round Eternity. To Mr. Hobs. 1. Vast Bodies of Philosophie I oft have seen, and read, But all are Bodies Dead, Or Bodies by Art fashioned; I never yet the Living Soul could see, But in thy Books and Thee. 'Tis onely God can know Whether the fair Idea thou dost show Agree intirely with his own or no. This I dare boldly tell, 'Tis so like Truth 'twill serve our turn as well. Just, as in Nature thy Proportions be, As full of Concord their Varietie, As firm the parts upon their Center rest, And all so Solid are that they at least As much as Nature, Emptiness detest. 2. Long did the mighty Stagirite retain The universal Intellectual reign, Saw his own Countreys short-liv'ed Leopard slain; The stronger Roman-Eagle did out-fly, Oftner renewed his Age, and saw that Dy. Mecha it self, in spite of Mahumet possest, And chas'ed by a wild Deluge from the East, His Monarchy new planted in the West. But as in time each great imperial race Degenerates, and gives some new one place: So did this noble Empire wast, Sunk by degrees from glories past, And in the School-mens hands it perisht quite at last. Then nought but Words it grew, And those all Barb'arous too. It perisht, and it vanisht there, The Life and Soul breath'd out, became but empty Air. 3. The Fields which answer'd well the Ancients Plow, Spent and out-worn return no Harvest now, In barren Age wild and unglorious lie, And boast of past Fertilitie, The poor relief of Present Povertie. Food and Fruit we now must want Unless new Lands we plant. We break up Tombs with Sacrilegious hands; Old Rubbish we remove; To walk in Ruines, like vain Ghosts, we love, And with fond Divining Wands We search among the Dead For Treasures Buried, Whilst still the Liberal Earth does hold So many Virgin Mines of undiscover'ed Gold. 4. The Baltique, Euxin, and the Caspian, And slender-limb'ed Mediterrean, Seem narrow Creeks to Thee, and only fit For the poor wretched Fisher-boats of Wit. Thy nobler Vessel the vast Ocean tries, And nothing sees but Seas and Skies, Till unknown Regions it descries, Thou great Columbus of the Golden Lands of new Philosophies. Thy task was harder much then his, For thy learn'd America is Not onely found out first by Thee, And rudely left to Future Industrie, But thy Eloquence and thy Wit, Has planted, peopled, built, and civiliz'd it. 5. I little thought before, (Nor being my own self so poor Could comprehend so vast a store) That all the Wardrobe of rich Eloquence, Could have afforded half enuff, Of bright, of new, and lasting stuff, To cloath the mighty Limbs of thy Gigantique Sence. Thy solid Reason like the shield from heaven To the Trojan Heroe given, Too strong to take a mark from any mortal dart, Yet shines with Gold and Gems in every part, And Wonders on it grave'd by the learn'd hand of Art, A shield that gives delight Even to the enemies sight, Then when they're sure to lose the Combat by't. 6. Nor can the Snow which now cold Age does shed Upon thy reverend Head, Quench or allay the noble Fires within, But all which thou hast bin, And all that Youth can be thou'rt yet, So fully still dost Thou Enjoy the Manhood, and the Bloom of Wit, And all the Natural Heat, but not the Feaver too. So Contraries on Ætna's top conspire, Here hoary Frosts, and by them breaks out Fire. A secure peace the faithful Neighbors keep, Th'emboldned Snow next to the Flame does sleep. And if we weigh, like Thee, Nature, and Causes, we shall see That thus it needs must be, To things Immortal Time can do no wrong, And that which never is to Dye, for ever must be Young. Destinie. Hoc quoq; Fatale est sic ipsum expendere Fatum. Manil. 1. Strange and unnatural! lets stay and see This Pageant of a Prodigie. Lo, of themselves th'enlivened Chesmen move, Lo, the unbred, ill-organ'd Pieces prove, As full of Art, and Industrie, Of Courage and of Policie, As we our selves who think ther's nothing Wise but We. Here a proud Pawn I'admire That still advancing higher At top of all became Another Thing and Name. Here I'm amaz'ed at th'actions of a Knight, That does bold wonders in the fight. Here I the losing party blame For those false Moves that break the Game, That to their Grave the Bag, the conquered Pieces bring, And above all, th'ill Conduct of the Mated King. 2. What e're these seem, what e're Philosophie And Sense or Reason tell (said I) These Things have Life, Election, Libertie; 'Tis their own Wisdom molds their State, Their Faults and Virtues make their Fate. They do, they do (said I) but strait Lo from my'enlightned Eyes the Mists and shadows fell That hinder Spirits from being Visible. And, lo, I saw two Angels plaid the Mate. With Man, alas, no otherwise it proves, An unseen Hand makes all their Moves. And some are Great, and some are Small, Some climb to good, some from good Fortune fall, Some Wisemen, and some Fools we call, Figures, alas, of Speech, for Desti'ny plays us all. 3. Me from the womb the Midwife Muse did take: She cut my Navel, washt me, and mine Head With her own Hands she Fashioned; She did a Covenant with me make, And circumcis'ed my tender Soul, and thus she spake, Thou of my Church shalt be, Hate and renounce (said she) Wealth, Honor, Pleasures, all the World for Me. Thou neither great at Court, nor in the War, Nor at th'Exchange shalt be, nor at the wrangling Bar. Content thy self with the small Barren Praise, That neglected Verse does raise. She spake, and all my years to come Took their unlucky Doom. Their several ways of Life let others chuse, Their several pleasures let them use, But I was born for Love, and for a Muse. 4. With Fate what boots it to contend? Such I began, such am, and so must end. The Star that did my Being frame, Was but a Lambent Flame, And some small Light it did dispence, But neither Heat nor Influence. No Matter, Cowley, let proud Fortune see, That thou canst her despise no less then she does Thee. Let all her gifts the portion be Of Folly, Lust, and Flattery, Fraud, Extortion, Calumnie, Murder, Infidelitie, Rebellion and Hypocrisie. Do Thou nor grieve nor blush to be, As all th'inspired tuneful Men, And all thy great Forefathers were from Homer down to Ben. Brutus. Excellent Brutus, of all humane race, The best till Nature was improv'ed by Grace, Till men above themselves Faith raised more Then Reason above Beasts before. Virtue was thy Lifes Center, and from thence Did silently and constantly dispense The gentle vigorous Influence To all the wide and fair Circumference: And all the parts upon it lean'd so easilie, Obey'd the mighty force so willinglie That none could discord or disorder see In all their Contrarietie. Each had his motion natural and free, And the Whole no more mov'ed then the whole World could be. 2. From thy strict rule some think that thou didst swerve (Mistaken Honest men) in Cæsars blood; What Mercy could the Tyrants Life deserve, From him who kill'd Himself rather then serve? Th'Heroick Exaltations of Good Are so far from Understood, We count them Vice: alas our Sight's so ill, That things which swiftest Move seem to stand still. We look not upon Virtue in her height, On her supreme Idea, brave and bright, In the Original Light: But as her Beams reflected pass Through our own Nature or ill Customs Glass. And 'tis no wonder so, If with dejected Ey In standing Pools we seek the sky, That Stars so high above should seem to us below. 3. Can we stand by and see Our Mother robb'ed, and bound, and ravisht be, Yet not to her assistance stir, Pleas'd with the Strength and Beauty of the Ravisher? Or shall we fear to kill him, if before The cancell'd Name of Friend he bore? Ingrateful Brutus do they call? Ingrateful Cæsar who could Rome enthrall! An act more barbarous and unnatural (In th'exact ballance of true Virtue try'de) Then his Successor Nero's Parricide! There's none but Brutus could deserve That all men else should wish to serve, And Cæsars usurpt place to him should proffer; None can deserve't but he who would refuse the offer. 4. Ill Fate assum'ed a Body thee t'affright, And wrapt itself i'th' terrors of the night, I'll meet thee at Philippi, said the Spright; I'll meet thee there, saidst Thou, With such a voyce, and such a brow, As put the trembling Ghost to sudden flight, It vanisht as a Tapers light Goes out when Spirits appear in sight. One would have thought t'had heard the morning crow, Or seen her well-appointed Star Come marching up the Eastern Hill afar. Nor durst it in Philippi's field appear, But unseen attaqu'ed thee there. Had it presum'ed in any shape thee to oppose, Thou wouldst have foro'ed it back upon thy foes: Or slain't like Cæsar, though it be A Conqu'eror and a Monarch mightier far then He. 5. What joy can humane things to us afford, When we see perish thus by odde events, Ill men, and wretched Accidents, The best Cause and best Man that ever drew a Sword? When we see The false Octavius, and wild Antonie, God-like Brutus, conquer Thee? What can we say but thine own Tragick Word, That Virtue, which had worshipt been by thee As the most solid Good, and greatest Deitie, By this fatal proof became An Idol only, and a Name, Hold noble Brutus and restrain The bold voyce of thy generous Disdain: These mighty Gulphs are yet Too deep for all thy Judgment and thy Wit. The Time's set forth already which shall quell Stiff Reason, when it offers to Rebell. Which these great Secrets shall unseal, And new Philosophies reveal. A few years more, so soon hadst thou not dy'ed, Would have confounded Humane Virtues pride, And shew'd thee a God crucifi'ed. To Dr. Scarborough. How long, alas! has our mad Nation been Of Epidemick War the Tragick Scene, When Slaughter all the while Seem'd like its Sea, embracing round the Isle, With Tempests, and red waves, Noise, and Affright? Albion no more, nor to be nam'ed from white! What Province, or what City did it spare? It, like a Plague, infected all the Aire. Sure the unpeopled Land Would now untill'd, desert, and naked stand, Had Gods All-mighty hand At the same time let loose Diseases rage Their Civil Wars in Man to wage. But Thou by Heaven wert sent This Desolation to prevent, A Medi'cine and a Counter-poyson to the Age, Scarce could the Sword dispatch more to the Grave, Then Thou didst save; By wondrous Art, and by successful care The Ruines of a Civil War thou dost alone repair. 2. The Inundations of all Liquid pain, And Deluge Dropsie thou do'est drain. Feavers so hot that one would say Thou mightst as soon Hell-fires allay (The Damn'd scarce more incurable then They) Thou dost so temper, that we find Like Gold the Body but refin'd; No unhealthful dross behind. The subtle Ague, that for sureness sake Takes its own times th' assault to make, And at each battery the whole Fort does shake, When thy strong Guards, and works it spies, Trembles for it self, and flies. The cruel Stone that restless pain That's sometimes roll'd away in vain, But still, like Sisyphus his stone, returns again, Thou break'st and meltest by learn'd Juyces force, (A greater work, though short the way appear, Then Hannibals by Vinegar) Oppressed Natures necessary course It stops in vain, like Moses, Thou Strik'st but the Rock, and straight the Waters freely flow. 3. The Indian Son of Lust, (that foul Disease Which did on this his new-found World, but lately seise; Yet since a Tyrannie has planted here, As wide and Cruel as the Spaniard there) Is so quite rooted out by Thee, That thy Patients seem to be Restor'ed not to Health onely, but Virginitie. The Plague it self, that proud Imperial Ill Which destroys Towns, and does whole Armies kill, If thou but succour the besieged Heart, Calls all its poysons forth, and does depart, As if it fear'd no less thy Art, Then Aarons Incense, or then Phineas dart. What need there here repeated be by me The vast and barbarous Lexicon Of Mans Infirmitie? At thy strong charms it must be gon Though a Disease, as well as Devil, were called Leagion. 4. From creeping Moss to soaring Cedar thou Dost all the powers and several Portions know, Which Father-Sun, Mother-Earth below On their green Infants here bestow. Can'st all those Magick Virtues from them draw, That keep Disease, and Death in aw. Who whilst thy wondrous skill in Plants they see, Fear lest the Tree of Life should be found out by Thee. And Thy well-travell'd knowledge too does give No less account of th'Empire Sensitive, Chiefly of Man, whose Body is That active Souls Metropolis. As the great Artist in his Sphere of Glass Saw the whole Scene of Heav'enly Motions pass, So thou know'st all so well that's done within, As if some living Chrystal Man thou'dst seen. 5. Nor does this Science make thy Crown alone, But Whole Apollo is thine owne. His gentler Arts, belov'ed in vain by Mee, Are wedded and enjoy'd by Thee. Thou'rt by this noble Mixture free From the Physitians frequent Maladie, Fantastick Incivilitie, There are who all their Patients chagrin have, As if they took each morn worse potions then they gave. And this great race of Learning thou hast runne, E're that of Life be half yet done. Thou see'st thy self still fresh and strong, And like t'enjoy thy Conquests long. The first fam'd Aphorism thy great Master spoke, Did he live now he would revoke, And better things of Man report; For thou do'est make Life long, and Art but short. 6. Ah, learned friend, it grieves me, when I think That Thou with all thy Art must dy As certainly as I. And all thy noble Reparations sink Into the sure-wrought Mine of treacherous Mortality. Like Archimedes, hon'orably in vain, Thou holdst out Towns that must at last be ta'ne, And Thou thy self their great Defender slain. Let's ev'en compound, and for the Present Live, 'Tis all the Ready Money Fate can give, Unbend sometimes thy restless care; And let thy Friends so happy be T'enjoy at once their Health and Thee. Some hours at least to thine own pleasures spare. Since the whole stock may soon exhausted be, Bestow't not all in Charitie. Let Nature, and let Art do what they please, When all's done, Life is an Incurable Disease. Life and Fame. 1. Oh Life, thou Nothings younger Brother! So like, that one might take One for the other! What's Some Body, or No Body? In all the Cobwebs of the Schoolmens trade, We no such nice Distinction woven see, As 'tis To be, or Not to Be. Dream of a Shadow! a Reflection made From the false glories of the gay reflected Bow, Is a more solid thing then Thou. Vain weak-built Isthmus, which dost proudly rise Up betwixt two Eternities; Yet canst nor Wave nor Wind sustain, But broken and orewhelm'd, the endless Oceans meet again. 2. And with what rare Inventions do we strive, Our selves then to survive? Wise, subtle Arts, and such as well befit That Nothing Mans no Wit. Some with vast costly Tombs would purchase it, And by the proofs of Death pretend to Live. Here lies the Great—False Marble, where? Nothing but small, and sordid Dust lies there. Some build enormous Mountain-Palaces, The Fools and Architects to please: A lasting Life in well-hew'en Stone they rear: So he who on th' Egyptian shore, Was slain so many hundred years before, Lives still (Oh Life most happy and most dear! Oh Life that Epicures envy to hear!) Lives in the dropping Ruines of his Ampitheater. 3. His Father in Law an higher place does claim In the Seraphique Entity of Fame. He since that Toy his Death, Does fill all Mouths, and breathes in all mens Breath. 'Tis true, the two Immortal Syllables remain, But, Oh ye learned men, explain, What Essence, what Existence this, What Substance, what Subsistence, what Hypostasis In Six poor Letters is? In those alone does the Great Cæsar live, 'Tis all the Conquered World could give. We Poets madder yet then all, With a refin'ed Phantastick Vanitie, Think we not onely Have, but Give Eternitie. Fain would I see that Prodigal, Who his To-morrow would bestow, For all old Homers Life e're since he Dy'ed till now. The Extasie. 1 I leave Mortality, and things below; I have no time in Complements to wast, Farewel to'ye all in hast, For I am call'd to go. A Whirlwind bears up my dull Feet, Th'officious Clouds beneath them meet. And (Lo!) I mount, and (Lo!) How small the biggest Parts of Earths proud Tittle show! 2 Where shall I find the noble Brittish Land? Lo, I at last a Northern Spec espie, Which in the Sea does lie, And seems a Grain o'th' Sand! For this will any sin, or Bleed? Of Civil Wars is this the Meed? And is it this, alas, which we (Oh Irony of Words!) do call Great Britanie? 3 I pass by th'arched Magazins, which hold Th' eternal stores of Frost, and Rain, and Snow; Dry, and secure I go, Nor shake with Fear, or Cold. Without affright or wonder I meet Clouds charg'd with Thunder, And Lightnings in my way Like harmless Lambent Fiers about my Temples play. 4 Now into'a gentle Sea of rowling Flame I'm plung'ed, and still mount higher there, As Flames mount up through aire. So perfect, yet so tame, So great, so pure, so bright a fire Was that unfortunate desire, My faithful Breast did cover, Then, when I was of late a wretched Mortal Lover. 5 Through several Orbs which one fair Planet bear, Where I behold distinctly as I pass The Hints of Galilæos Glass, I touch at last the spangled Sphære. Here all th'extended Skie Is but one Galaxie, 'Tis all so bright and gay, And the joynt Eyes of Night make up a perfect Day. 6 Where am I now? Angels and God is here; An unexhausted Ocean of delight Swallows my senses quite, And drowns all What, or How, or Where. Not Paul, who first did thither pass, And this great Worlds Columbus was, The tyrannous pleasure could express. Oh 'tis too much for Man! but let it ne're be less. 7 The mighty' Elijah mounted so on high, That second Man, who leapt the Ditch where all The rest of Mankind fall, And went not downwards to the skie. With much of pomp and show (As Conquering Kings in Triumph go) Did he to Heav'en approach, And wondrous was his Way, and wondrous was his Coach. 8 'Twas gawdy all, and rich in every part, Of Essences of Gems, and Spirit of Gold Was its substantial mold; Drawn forth by Chymique Angels art. Here with Moon-beams 'twas silver'd bright, There double-gilt with the Suns light And mystique Shapes cut round in it, Figures that did transcend a Vulgar Angels wit. 9 The Horses were of temper'd Lightning made, Of all that in Heav'ens beauteous Pastures feed, The noblest, sprightfulst breed, And flaming Mains their Necks array'd. They all were shod with Diamond, Not such as here are found, But such light solid ones as shine On the Transparent Rocks o'th' Heaven Chrystalline. 10 Thus mounted the great Prophet to the skies; Astonisht Men who oft had seen Stars fall, Or that which so they call, Wondred from hence to see one rise. The soft Clouds melted him a way, The Snow and Frosts which in it lay A while the sacred footsteps bore, The Wheels and Horses Hoofs hizz'd as they past them ore. 11 He past by th' Moon and Planets, and did fright All the Worlds there which at this Meteor gaz'ed, And their Astrologers amaz'd With th'unexampled sight. But where he stopt will ne're be known, Till Phœnix Nature aged grown To'a better Being do aspire, And mount herself, like Him, to' Eternitie in Fire. To the New Year. 1. Great Janus, who dost sure my Mistris view With all thine eyes, yet think'st them all too few: If thy Fore-face do see No better things prepar'ed for me, Then did thy Face behind, If still her Breast must shut against me be (For 'tis not Peace that Temples Gate does bind) Oh let my Life, if thou so many deaths a coming find, With thine old year its voyage take Born down, that stream of Time which no return can make. 2. Alas, what need I thus to pray? Th'old avaritious year Whether I would or no, will bear At least a part of Me away. His well-horst Troops, the Months, and Days, and Hours, Though never any where they stay, Make in their passage all their Prey. The Months, Days, Hours that march i'th' Rear can find Nought of Value left behind. All the good Wine of Life our drunken youth devours; Sowreness and Lees, which to the bottom sink, Remain for latter years to Drink. Until some one offended with the taste The Vessel breaks, and out the wretched Reliques run at last. 3. If then, young year, thou needs must come, (For in Times fruitful womb The Birth beyond its Time can never tarry, Nor ever can miscarry) Choose thy Attendants well; for 'tis not Thee We fear, but 'tis thy Companie, Let neither Loss of Friends, or Fame, or Libertie, Nor pining Sickness, nor tormenting Pain, Nor Sadness, nor uncleanly Povertie, Be seen among thy Train, Nor let thy Livery be Either black Sin, or gawdy vanitie; Nay, if thou lov'st me, gentle Year, Let not so much as Love be there: Vain fruitless Love, I mean; for, gentle Year, Although I feare, There's of this Caution little need, Yet, gentle Year, take heed How thou dost make Such a Mistake. Such Love I mean alone As by thy cruel Predecessors has been shown, For though I'have too much cause to doubt it, I fain would try for once if Life can Live without it. 4. Into the Future Times why do we pry, And seek to Antedate our Misery? Like Jealous men why are we longing still To See the thing which onely seeing makes an Ill? 'Tis well the Face is vail'd; for 'twere a Sight That would even Happiest men affright, And something still they'd spy that would destroy The past and Present Joy In whatsoever Character; The Book of Fate is writ, 'Tis well we understand not it, We should grow Mad with little Learning there. Upon the Brink of every Ill we did Foresee, Undecently and foolishlie We should stand shivering, and but slowly venter The Fatal Flood to enter, Since willing, or unwilling we must do it, They feel least cold and pain who plunge at once into it. Life. Nascentes Morimur. Manil. 1. We're ill by these Grammarians us'd; We are abus'd by Words, grosly abus'd; From the Maternal Tomb, To the Graves fruitful Womb, We call here Life; but Life's a name That nothing here can truly claim: This wretched Inn, where we scarce stay to bait: We call our Dwelling-place; We call one Step a Race: But Angels in their full enlightned state, Angels who Live, and know what 'tis to Be, Who all the nonsense of our Language see, Who speak Things, and our Words, their ill-drawn Pictures scorn, When we by'a foolish Figure say, Behold an old man Dead! then they Speak properly, and cry, Behold a man-child born. 2. My Eyes are opened, and I see Through the Transparent Fallacie: Because we seem wisely to talk Like men of business; and for business walk From place to place, And mighty voyages we take, And mighty Journeys seem to make, O're Sea and Land, the little Point that has no space. Because we fight, and Battels gain; Some Captives call, and say, the rest are slain. Because we heap up yellow Earth, and so, Rich, valiant, wise, and vertuous seem to grow; Because we draw a long Nobilitie From Hieroglyphick proofs of Herauldrie, And impudently talk of a Posteritie, And, like Egyptian Chroniclers, Who write of twenty thousand years, With Maravedies make the' account, That single Time might to a sum amount, We grow at last by Custom to believe, That really we Live: Whilst all these Shadows that for Things we take, Are but the empty Dreams which in Deaths sleep we make. 3. But these fantastique errors of our Dream, Lead us to solid wrong; We pray God, our Friends torments to prolong, And wish uncharitably for them, To be as long a Dying as Methusalem. The ripened Soul longs from his pris'on to come, But we would seal, and sow up, if we could, the Womb. We seek to close and plaster up by Art The cracks and breaches of the' extended Shell, And in that narrow Cell Would rudely force to dwell, The noble vigorous Bird already wing'd to part. The 34. Chapter of the Prophet Isaiah. 1. Awake, and with attention hear, Thou drowsie World, for it concerns thee near; Awake, I say, and listen well, To what from God, I, his loud Prophet, tell. Bid both the Poles suppress their stormy noise, And bid the roaring Sea contain its voyce. Be still thou Sea, be still thou Air and Earth, Still, as old Chaos, before Motions birth, A dreadful Host of Judgments is gone out; In strength and number more Then e're was rais'd by God before, To scourge the Rebel World, and march it round about. 2. I see the Sword of God brandisht above; And from it streams a dismal ray; I see the Scabbard cast away. How red anon with Slaughter will it prove! How will it sweat and reek in blood! How will the Scarlet-glutton be o'regorged with his food! And devour all the mighty Feast! Nothing soon but Bones will rest. God does a solemn Sacrifice prepare; But not of Oxen, nor of Rams, Not of Kids, nor of their Dams, Not of Heifers, nor of Lams. The Altar all the Land, and all Men in't the Victims are, Since wicked Mens more guilty blood to spare, The Beasts so long have sacrificed bin, Since Men their Birth-right forfeit still by Sin, 'Tis fit at last Beasts their Revenge should have, And Sacrificed Men their better Brethren save. 3. So will they fall, so will they flee; Such will the Creatures wild distraction be, When at the final Doom, Nature and Time shall both be Slain, Shall struggle with Deaths pangs in vain, And the whole world their Funeral Pile become. The wide-stretcht Scrowl of Heaven, which we Immortal as the Deity think, With all the beauteous Characters that in it With such deep Sense by Gods own Hand were writ, Whose Eloquence though we understand not, we admire, Shall crackle, and the parts together shrink Like Parchment in a fire. Th'exhausted Sun to th'Moon no more shall lend; But truly then headlong into the Sea descend. The glittering Host, now in such fair array, So proud, so well appointed, and so gay, Like fearful Troops in some strong Ambush ta'ne, Shall some fly routed, and some fall slaine, Thick as ripe Fruit, or yellow Leaves in Autumn fall, With such a violent Storm as blows down Tree and all. 4. And Thou, O cursed Land, Which wilt not see the Præcipice where thou dost stand, Though thou standst just upon the brink; Thou of this poysoned Bowl the bitter Dregs shalt drink. Thy Rivers and thy Lakes shall so With humane blood oreflow; That they shall fetch the slaughter'd corps away, Which in the fields around unburied lay, And rob the Beasts and Birds to give the Fish their prey. The rotting corps shall so infect the aire; Beget such Plagues, and putrid Venomes there, That by thine own Dead shall be slain, All thy few Living that remain. As one who buys, Surveys a ground, So the Destroying Angel measures it around. So careful and so strict he is, Lest any Nook or Corner he should miss. He walks about the perishing Nation, Ruine behind him stalks and empty Desolation. 5. Then shall the Market and the Pleading-place Be choakt with Brambles and oregrown with grass. The Serpents through thy Streets shall rowl, And in thy lower rooms the Wolves shall howl, And thy gilt Chambers lodge the Raven and the Owl, And all the wing'd Ill-Omens of the aire, Though no new-Ills can be fore-boded there. The Lyon then shall to the Leopard say, Brother Leopard come away; Behold a Land which God has giv'en us in prey! Behold a Land from whence we see Mankind expulst, His and Our common Enemie! The Brother Leopard shakes himself, and does not stay. 6. The glutted Vulturs shall expect in vain New Armies to be slain. Shall find at last the business done, Leave their consumed Quarters, and be gone. Th'unburied Ghosts shall sadly moan, The Satyrs laugh to hear them groan. The Evil Spirits that delight To dance and revel in the Mask of Night, The Moon and Stars, their sole Spectators shall affright. And if of lost Mankind Ought happen to be left behind, If any Reliques but remain, They in the Dens shall lurk, Beasts in the Palaces shall raign. The Plagues of Egypt. 1. Is this thy Brav'ery Man, is this thy Pride? Rebel to God, and Slave to all beside! Captiv'ed by everything! and onely Free To fly from thine own Libertie! All Creatures the Creator said Were Thine; No Creature but might since, say, Man is Mine! In black Egyptian Slavery we lie; And sweat and toil in the vile Drudgerie Of Tyrant Sin; To which we Trophees raise, and wear out all our Breath, In building up the Monuments of Death; We, the choice Race, to God and Angels Kin! In vain the Prophets and Apostles come To call us home, Home to the promis'ed Canaan above, Which does with nourishing Milk, and pleasant Honey flow; And ev'en i'th'way to which we should be fed With Angels tasteful Bread: But, we, alas, the Flesh-pots love, We love the very Leeks and sordid roots below. 2. In vain we Judgments feel, and Wonders see; In vain did God to descend hither dain, He was his own Ambassador in vain, Our Moses and our Guid himself to be. We will not let our selves to go, And with worse hardned hearts do our own Pharaohs grow; Ah, lest at last we perish so! Think, stubborn Man, think of th'Egyptian Prince, (Hard of Belief and Will, but not so hard as Thou) Think with what dreadful proofs God did convince The feeble arguments that humane pow'er could show; Think what Plagues attend on Thee, Who Moses God dost now refuse, more oft then Moses He. 3. If from some God you come (said the proud King) With half a smile and half a Frown; (But what God can to Egypt be unknown?) What Sign, what Powers, what Credence do you bring? Behold his Seal, behold his Hand, Cryes Moses, and casts down th' Almighty Wand. Th' Almighty Wand scarce toucht the Earth, When with an undiscerned birth Th' Almighty Wand a Serpent grew And his long half in painted folds behind him drew. Upwards his threatning Tail he threw; Upwards he cast his threatning Head, He gap'ed and hist aloud; With flaming Eyes survey'd the trembling croud, And like a Basilisk almost lookt the Assembly dead; Swift fled th' Amazed King, the Guards before him fled. 4. Jannes and Jambres stopt their flight, And with proud words allay'd th'affright. The God of Slaves (said they) how can he be More powerful then their Masters Deitie? And down they cast their Rods, And mutter'ed secret sounds that charm the servile Gods. The evil Spirits their charms obey, And in a subtle cloud they snatch the Rods away, And Serpents in their place the airy Juglers lay. Serpents in Egypts monstrous land, Were ready still at hand, And all at the Old Serpents first command. And they too gap'ed, and they too hist, And they their threatning Tails did twist, But strait on both the Hebrew-Serpent flew; Broke both their active Backs, and both it slew, And both almost at once devour'ed, So much was over-power'ed By Gods miraculous Creation His Servants Natures slightly-wrought, and feeble Generation. 5. On the fame'd bank the Prophets stood, Toucht with their Rod, and wounded all the Flood; Flood now no more, but a long Vein of putrid Blood. The helpless Fish were found In their strange Current drownd, The Herbs and Trees washt by the mortal Tide About it blusht and dyed. Th'amazed Crocodiles made haste to ground; From their vast trunks the dropping gore they spied, Thought it their Own, and dreadfully aloud they cried. Nor all thy Priests, nor Thou Oh King, couldst ever show From whence thy wandring Nile begins his course; Of this new Nile thou seest the sacred Sourse; And as thy Land that does oreflow, Take heed lest this do so. What Plague more just could on thy Waters fall? The Hebrew Infants Murder stains them all. The kind, instructing Punishment enjoy; Whom the Red River cannot Mend, the Red-sea shall Destroy. 6. The River yet gave one Instruction more, And from the rotting Fish and unconcocted Gore, Which was but Water just before, A loathsome Host was quickly made, That scale'd the Banks, &amp; with loud noise did all the Country invade. As Nilus when he quits his sacred Bed (But like a Friend he visits all the Land With welcome presents in his hand) So did this Living Tide the Fields orespread. In vain th'alarmed Countrey tries To kill their noisome Enemies, From th'unexhausted Sourse still new Recruits arise. Nor does the Earth these greedy Troops suffice, The Towns and Houses they possess, The Temples and the Palaces, Nor Pharaoh, nor his Gods they fear; Both their importune croakings hear. Unsatiate yet they mount up higher, Where never Sun-born Frog durst to aspire; And in the silken Beds their slimy Members place; A Luxurie unknown before to all the Watry Race. 7. The Water thus her Wonders did produce; But both were to no use. As yet the Sorcerers mimick power serv'ed for excuse. Try what the Earth will do (said God) and, Lo! They stroke the Earth a fertile blow. And all the Dust did strait to stir begin; One would have thought some sudden Wind t'had bin; But, Lo, 'twas nimble Life was got within! And all the little Springs did move, And every Dust did an arm'ed Vermine prove, Of an unknown and new-created kind, Such as the Magick-Gods could neither make nor find. The wretched shameful Foe allow'ed no rest Either to Man or Beast. Not Phar[ao]h from th'unquiet Plague could be, With all his change of Rayments free; The Devils themselves confest This was Gods Hand; and 'twas but just To punish thus mans pride, to punish Dust with Dust. 8. Lo the third Element does his Plagues prepare, And swarming Clouds of Insects fill the Air. With sullen noise they take their flight, And march in Bodies infinite; In vain 'tis Day above, 'tis still beneath them Night. Of harmful Flies the Nations numberless, Compos'ed this mighty Armies spacious boast; Of different Manners, different Languages; And different Habits too they wore, And different Arms they bore. And some, like Scythians, liv'ed on Blood, And some on Green, and some on Flowry Food, And Accaron, the Airy Prince, led on this various Host. Houses secure not Men, the populous ill Did all the Houses fill. The Country, all around, Did with the cryes of tortured Cattel sound; About the fields enrag'ed they flew, And wisht the Plague that was t'ensue. 9. From poysonous Stars a mortal Influence came (The mingled Malice of their Flame) A skilful Angel did th'Ingredients take, And with just hands the sad Composure make, And over all the Land did the full viol shake. Thirst, Giddiness, Faintness, and putrid Heats, And pining Pains, and Shivering Sweats, On all the Cattle, all the Beasts did fall; With deform'ed Death the Countrey's covered all. The labouring Ox drops down before the Plow; The crowned Victims to the Altar led Sink, and prevent the lifted blow. The generous Horse from the full Manger turns his Head; Does his Lov'ed Floods and Pastures scorn, Hates the shrill Trumpet and the Horn, Nor can his lifeless Nostril please, With the once-ravishing smell of all his dappled Mistresses. The starving Sheep refuse to feed, They bleat their innocent Souls out into air; The faithful Dogs lie gasping by them there; Th'astonisht Shepherd weeps, and breaks his tuneful Reed. 10. Thus did the Beasts for Mans Rebellion dy, God did on Man a Gentler Medicine try, And a Disease for Physick did apply. Warm ashes from the Furnace Moses took; The Sorcerers did with wonder on him look; And smil'ed at th'unaccustom'ed Spell Which no Egyptian Rituals tell. He flings the pregnant Ashes through the Air, And speaks a mighty Pray'er, Both which the Ministring Winds around all Egypt bear. As gentle western Blasts with downy wings Hatching the tender Springs To the'unborn Buds with vital whispers say, Ye Living Buds why do ye stay? The passionate Buds break through the Bark their way: So wheresoere this tainted Wind but blew, Swelling Pains and Ulcers grew; It from the body call'ed all sleeping Poysons out, And to them added new; A noysome Spring of Sores, as thick as Leaves did sprout. 11. Heaven it self is angry next; Wo to Man, when Heav'en is vext. With sullen brow it frown'd, And murmur'ed first in an imperfect sound. Till Moses lifting up his hand, Waves the expected Signal of his Wand, And all the full-charg'ed clouds in ranged Squadrons move, And fill the spacious Plains above. Through which the rowling Thunder first does play, And opens wide the Tempests noisy way. And straight a stony shower Of monstrous Hail does downwards pour, Such as nere Winter yet brought forth From all her stormy Magazins of the North. It all the Beasts and Men abroad did slay, O're the defaced corps, like Monuments, lay, The houses and strong-body'ed Trees it broke, Nor askt aid from the Thunders stroke. The Thunder but for Terror through it flew, The Hail alone the work could do. The dismal Lightnings all around, Some flying through the Air, some running on the ground, Some swimming o're the waters face, Fill'd with bright Horror every place. One would have thought their dreadful Day to have seen, The very Hail, and Rain it self had kindled been. 12. The Infant Corn, which yet did scarce appear, Escap'ed this general Massacer Of every thing that grew, And the well-stored Egyptian year Began to cloath her Fields and Trees anew. When, Lo! a scorching wind from the burnt Countrys blew, And endless Legions with it drew Of greedy Locusts, who where e're With sounding wings they flew, Left all the Earth depopulate and bare, As if Winter it self had marcht by there. What e're the Sun and Nile Gave with large Bounty to the thankful soil, The wretched Pillagers bore away, And the whole Summer was their Prey, Till Moses with a prayer Breath'd forth a violent Western wind, Which all these living clouds did headlong bear (No Stragglers left behind) Into the purple Sea, and there bestow On the luxurious Fish a Feast they ne're did know. With untaught joy, Pharaoh the News does hear, And little thinks their Fate attends on Him, and His so near. 13. What blindness or what Darkness did there e're Like this undocil King's appear? What e're but that which now does represent And paint the Crime out in the Punishment? From the deep, baleful Caves of Hell below, Where the old Mother Night does grow, Substantial Night, that does disclaime, Privation's empty Name, Through secret conduits monstrous shapes arose, Such as the Suns whole force could not oppose, They with a Solid Cloud All Heavens Eclypsed Face did shrowd. Seem'd with large Wings spred o're the Sea and Earth To brood up a new Chaos his deformed birth. And every Lamp, and every Fire Did at the dreadful sight wink and expire, To th'Empyrean Sourse all streams of Light seem'd to retire. The living Men were in their standing-houses buried; But the long Night no slumber knows, But the short Death finds no repose. Ten thousand terrors through the darkness fled, And Ghosts complain'd, and Spirits murmured. And Fancies multiplying sight View'd all the Scenes Invisible of Night. 14. Of Gods dreadful anger these Were but the first light Skirmishes; The Shock and bloody battel now begins, The plenteous Harvest of full-ripened Sins. It was the time, when the still Moon Was mounted softly to her Noon, And dewy sleep, which from Nights secret springs arose, Gently as Nile the land oreflows. When (Lo!) from the high Countreys of refined Day, The Golden Heaven without allay, Whose dross in the Creation purg'ed away, Made up the Suns adulterate ray, Michael, the warlike Prince, does downwards fly Swift as the journeys of the Sight, Swift as the race of Light, And with his Winged Will cuts through the yielding sky. He past throw many a Star, and as he past, Shone (like a star in them) more brightly there, Then they did in their Sphere. On a tall Pyramids pointed Head he stopt at last, And a mild look of sacred Pity cast Down on the sinful Land where he was sent, T'inflict the tardy punishment. Ah! yet (said He) yet stubborn King repent; Whilst thus unarm'ed I stand, Ere the keen Sword of God fill my commanded Hand; Suffer but yet Thy self, and Thine to live; Who would, alas! believe That it for Man (said He) So hard to be Forgiven should be, And yet for God so easie to Forgive! 15. He spoke, and downwards flew, And ore his shining Form a well-cut cloud he threw Made of the blackest Fleece of Night, And close-wrought to keep in the powerful Light, Yet wrought so fine it hindred not his Flight. But through the Key-holes and the chinks of dores, And through the narrow'est Walks of crooked Pores, He past more swift and free, Then in wide air the wanton Swallows flee. He took a pointed Pestilence in his hand, The Spirits of thousand mortal poysons made The strongly temper'd Blade, The sharpest Sword that e're was laid Up in the Magazins of God to scourge a wicked Land. Through Egypts wicked Land his march he took. And as he marcht the sacred First-born strook Of every womb; none did he spare; None from the meanest Beast to Cenchres purple Heire. 16. The swift approach of endless Night, Breaks ope the wounded Sleepers rowling Eyes; They'awake the rest with dying cries, And Darkness doubles the affright. The mixed sounds of scatter'd Deaths they hear, And lose their parted Souls 'twixt Grief and Fear. Louder then all the shrieking Womens voice Pierces this Chaos of confused noise. As brighter Lightning cuts a way Clear, and distinguisht through the Day. With less complaints the Zoan Temples sound, When the adored Heifer's drownd, And no true markt Successor to be found. Whilst Health, and Strength, and Gladness does possess The festal Hebrew Cottages; The blest Destroyer comes not there To interrupt the sacred cheare That new begins their well-reformed Year. Upon their doors he read and understood, Gods Protection writ in Blood; Well was he skild i'th' Character Divine; And though he past by it in haste, He bow'd and worshipt as he past, The mighty Mysterie through its humble Signe. 17. The Sword strikes now too deep and near, Longer with it's edge to play; No Diligence or Cost they spare To haste the Hebrews now away, Pharaoh himself chides their delay; So kinde and bountiful is Fear! But, oh, the Bounty which to Fear we ow, Is but like Fire struck out of stone. So hardly got, and quickly gone, That it scarce out-lives the Blow. Sorrow and fear soon quit the Tyrants brest; Rage and Revenge their place possest With a vast Host of Chariots and of Horse, And all his powerful Kingdoms ready force The travelling Nation he pursues; Ten times orecome, he still th'unequal war renewes. Fill'd with proud hopes, At least (said he) Th' Egyptian Gods from Syrian Magick free Will now revenge Themselves and Me; Behold what passless Rocks on either hand Like Prison walls about them stand! Whilst the Sea bounds their Flight before, And in our injur'ed justice they must find A far worse stop then Rocks and Seas behind. Which shall with crimson gore New paint the Waters Name, and double dye the shore. 18. He spoke; and all his Host Approv'ed with shouts th'unhappy boast, A bidden wind bore his vain words away, And drown'd them in the neighb'ring Sea. No means t'escape the faithless Travellers spie, And with degenerous fear to die, Curse their new-gotten Libertie. But the great Guid well knew he led them right, And saw a Path hid yet from humane sight. He strikes the raging waves, the waves on either side Unloose their close Embraces, and divide; And backwards press, as in some solemn show The crowding People do (Though just before no space was seen) To let the admired Triumph pass between. The wondring Army saw on either hand The no less wondring Waves, like Rocks of Crystal stand. They marcht betwixt, and boldly trod The secret paths of God. And here and there all scatter'd in their way The Seas old spoils, and gaping Fishes lay Deserted on the sandy plain, The Sun did with astonishment behold The inmost Chambers of the opened Main, For whatsoere of old By his own Priests the Poets has been said, He never sunk till then into the Oceans Bed. 19. Led chearfully by a bright Captain Flame, To th'other shore at Morning Dawn they came, And saw behind th'unguided Foe March disorderly and slow. The Prophet straight from th'Idumæan strand Shakes his Imperious Wand. The upper waves, that highest crowded lie, The beckning Wand espie. Straight their first right-hand files begin to move, And with a murmuring wind Give the word March to all behind. The left-hand Squadrons no less ready prove, But with a joyful louder noise Answer their distant fellows voice, And haste to meet them make, As several Troops do all at once a common Signal take. What tongue th'amazement and th'affright can tell Which on the Chamian Army fell, When on both sides they saw the roaring Main Broke loose from his Invisible Chain? They saw the monstrous Death and watry War Come rowling down loud Ruine from afar. In vain some backward, and some forwards fly With helpless haste; in vain they cry To their Cœlestial Beasts for aid; In vain their guilty King they'upbraid, In vain on Moses he, and Moses God does call, With a Repentance true too late; They're compast round with a devouring Fate That draws, like a strong Net, the mighty Sea upon them All.

His escape to his own house, from whence being pursued by the Kings Guard, by the artifice of his Wife Michol he escapes, and flies to Naioh, the Prophets Colledge at Ramah. Sauls speech, and rage at his escape. A long Digression describing the Prophets Colledge, and their manner of life there, and the ordinary subjects of their Poetry. Sauls Guards pursue David thither, and prophesie. Saul among the Prophets. He is compared to Balaam, whose Song concludes the Book. I sing the Man who Judahs Scepter bore In that right hand which held the Crook before; Who from best Poet, best of Kings did grow; The two chief gifts Heav'n could on Man bestow. Much danger first, much toil did he sustain, Whilst Saul and Hell crost his strong fate in vain. Nor did his Crown less painful work afford; Less exercise his Patience, or his Sword; So long her Conque'ror Fortunes spight pursu'd; Till with unwearied Virtue he subdu'd All homebred Malice, and all forreign boasts; Their strength was Armies, his the Lord of Hosts. Thou, who didst Davids royal stem adorn, Joh. 8. 58. And gav'st him birth from whom thy self was't born. Who didst in Triumph at Deaths Court appear, And slew'st him with thy Nails, thy Cross and Spear, Whilst Hells black Tyrant trembled to behold, The glorious light he forfeited of old, Who Heav'ns glad burden now, and justest pride, Sit'st high enthron'd next thy great Fathers side, (Where hallowed Flames help to adorn that Head Which once the blushing Thorns environed, Till crimson drops of precious blood hung down Like Rubies to enrich thine humble Crown.) Ev'en Thou my breast with such blest rage inspire, As mov'd the tuneful strings of Davids Lyre, Guid my bold steps with thine old trav'elling Flame, In these untrodden paths to Sacred Fame; Lo, with pure hands thy heav'enly Fires to take, My well-chang'd Muse I a chast Vestal make! From earths vain joys, and loves soft witchcraft free, I consecrate my Magdalene to Thee! Lo, this great work, a Temple to thy praise, On polisht Pillars of strong Verse I raise! A Temple, where if Thou vouchsafe to dwell, It Solomons, and Herods shall excel. Too long the Muses-Land have Heathen bin; Their Gods too long were Dev'ils, and Vertues Sin; But Thou, Eternal Word, hast call'd forth Me Th' Apostle, to convert that World to Thee; T' unbind the charms that in slight Fables lie, And teach that Truth is truest Poesie. The malice now of jealous Saul grew less, O'recome by constant Virtue, and Success; He grew at last more weary to command New dangers, than young David to withstand Or Conquer them; he fear'd his mastring Fate, And envy'd him a Kings unpowerful Hate. Well did he know how Palms by 'oppression speed, Victorious, and the Victors sacred Meed! The Burden lifts them higher. Well did he know, How a tame stream does wild and dangerous grow By unjust force; he now with wanton play, Kisses the smiling Banks, and glides away, But his known Channel stopt, begins to roare, And swell with rage, and buffet the dull shore. His mutinous waters hurry to the War, And Troops of Waves come rolling from afar. Then scorns he such weak stops to his free source, And overruns the neighboring fields with violent course. This knew the Tyrant, and this useful thought His wounded mind to health and temper brought. He old kind vows to David did renew, Swore constancy, and meant his oath for true. A general joy at this glad news appear'd, For David all men lov'd, and Saul they fear'd. Angels and Men did Peace, and David love, But Hell did neither Him, nor That approve; From mans agreement fierce Alarms they take; And Quiet here, does there new Business make. Beneath the silent chambers of the earth, Where the Suns fruitful beams give metals birth, Where he the growth of fatal Gold does see, Gold which above more Influence has than He. Beneath the dens where unfletcht Tempests lye, And infant Winds their tender Voyces try, Beneath the mighty Oceans wealthy Caves, Beneath th' eternal Fountain of all Waves, Where their vast Court the Mother-waters keep, And undisturb'd by Moons in silence sleep, There is a place deep, wondrous deep below, Which genuine Night and Horrour does o'reflow; No bound controls th' unwearied space, but Hell Endless as those dire pains that in it dwell. Here no dear glimpse of the Suns lovely face, Strikes through the Solid darkness of the place; No dawning Morn does her kind reds display; One slight weak beam would here be thought the Day. No gentle stars with their fair Gems of Light Offend the tyr'anous and unquestion'd Night. Here Lucifer the mighty Captive reigns; Proud, 'midst his Woes, and Tyrant in his Chains. Once General of a guilded Host of Sprights, Like Hesper, leading forth the spangled Nights. But down like Lightning, which him struck, he came; And roar'd at his first plunge into the Flame. Myriads of Spirits fell wounded round him there; With dropping Lights thick shone the singed Air. Since when the dismal Solace of their wo, Has only been weak Mankind to undo; Themselves at first against themselves they 'excite, (Their dearest Conquest, and most proud delight) And if those Mines of secret Treason fail, With open force mans Vertue they assail; Unable to corrupt, seek to destroy; And where their Poysons miss, the Sword employ. Thus sought the Tyrant Fiend young Davids fall; And 'gainst him arm'd the pow'erful rage of Saul. He saw the beauties of his shape and face, His female sweetness, and his manly grace, 1 Sam. 16. 12. He saw the nobler wonders of his Mind, Great Gifts, which for Great Works he knew design'd. He saw (t' ashame the strength of Man and Hell) 1 Sam. 17. How by's young hands their Gathite Champion fell. He saw the reverend Prophet boldly shed The Royal Drops round his Enlarged Head. 1 Sam. 16. 13. And well he knew what Legacy did place, Gen. 49. 10. The sacred Scepter in blest Judahs race, From which th' Eternal Shilo was to spring; A Knowledge which new Hells to Hell did bring! And though no less he knew himself too weak The smallest Link of strong-wrought Fate to break; Yet would he rage, and struggle with the Chain; Lov'd to Rebel though sure that 'twas in vain. And now it broke his form'd design, to find The gentle change of Sauls recov'ering Mind. He trusted much in Saul, and rag'ed, and griev'd (The great Deceiver) to be Himself Deceiv'd. Thrice did he knock his Iron teeth, thrice howl, And into frowns his wrathful forehead rowl. His eyes dart forth red flames which scare the Night, And with worse Fires the trembling Ghosts affright. A Troop of gastly Fiends compass him round, And greedily catch at his lips fear'd sound. Are we such Nothings then (said He) Our will Crost by a Shepherds Boy? and you yet still Play with your idle Serpents here? dares none Attempt what becomes Furies? are ye grown Benum'd with Fear, or Vertues sprightless cold, You, who were once (I'm sure) so brave and bold? Oh my ill-chang'd condition! oh my fate! Did I lose Heav'en for this? With that, with his long tail he lasht his breast, And horribly spoke out in Looks the rest. The quaking Pow'ers of Night stood in amaze, And at each other first could only gaze. A dreadful Silence fill'd the hollow place, Doubling the native terrour of Hells face; Rivers of flaming Brimstone, which before So loudly rag'd, crept softly by the shore; No hiss of Snakes, no clanck of Chains was known, The Souls amidst their Tortures durst not groan. Envy at last crawls forth from that dire throng, Of all the direful'st; her black locks hung long, Attir'd with curling Serpents; her pale skin Was almost dropt from the sharp bones within, And at her breast stuck Vipers which did prey Upon her panting heart, both night and day Sucking black bloud from thence, which to repair Both night and day they left fresh poysons there. Her garments were deep stain'd in humane gore, And torn by her own hands, in which she bore A knotted whip, and bowl, that to the brim Did with green gall, and juice of wormwood swim. With which when she was drunk, she furious grew And lasht herself; thus from th' accursed crew, Envy, the worst of Fiends, herself presents, Envy, good only when she herself torments. Spend not, great King, thy precious rage (said she) Upon so poor a cause; shall Mighty We The glory of our wrath to him afford? Are We not Furies still? and you our Lord? At thy dread anger the fixt World shall shake, And frighted Nature her own Laws forsake. Do Thou but threat, loud storms shall make reply, And Thunder eccho't to the trembling Sky, Whilst raging Seas swell to so bold an height, As shall the Fires proud Element affright. Th' old drudging Sun from his long-beaten way, Shall at thy Voice start, and misguide the day. The jocond Orbs shall break their measur'd pace, And stubborn Poles change their allotted place. Heav'ens guilded Troops shall flutter here and there, Leaving their boasting Songs tun'd to a Sphere; Nay their God too—for fear he did, when We Took noble Arms against his Tyrannie, So noble Arms, and in a Cause so great, That Triumphs they deserve for their Defeat. There was a Day! oh might I see't again Though he had fiercer Flames to thrust us in! And can such pow'rs be by a Child withstood? Will Slings, alas, or Pebles do him good? What th' untam'd Lyon, whet with hunger too, And Gyants could not, that my Word shall do: I'll soon dissolve this Peace; were Sauls new Love (But Saul we know) great as my Hate shall prove, Before their Sun twice be gone about, I, and my faithful Snakes would drive it out. By Me Cain offer'd up his Brothers gore, Gen. 4. 8. A Sacrifice far worse than that before; I saw him fling the stone, as if he meant, At once his Murder and his Monument, And laught to see (for 'twas a goodly show) The Earth by her first Tiller fatned so. Ib. v. 2. Exod. 14. 23. I drove proud Pharaoh to the parted Sea; He, and his Host drank up cold death by Me; By Me rebellious Arms fierce Corah took, And Moses (curse upon that Name!) forsook; Num. 16. 1. Hither (ye know) almost alive he came Ib. 31. Through the cleft Earth; Ours was his Fun'eral Flame. By Me—but I lose time, methinks, and should Perform new acts whilst I relate the old; David's the next our fury must enjoy; 'Tis not thy God himself shall save thee, Boy; No, if he do, may the whole World have Peace; May all ill Actions, all ill Fortune cease, And banisht from this potent Court below, May I a ragged, contemn'd Vertue grow. She spoke; all star'ed at first, and made a pause; But strait the general murmur of applause Ran through Deaths Courts; she frown'd still, and begun To envy at the praise herself had won. Great Belzebub starts from his burning Throne To' embrace the Fiend, but she now furious grown To act her part; thrice bow'd, and thence she fled; The Snakes all hist, the Fiends all murmured. It was the time when silent night began T'enchain with sleep the busie spirits of Man; And Saul himself, though in his troubled breast The weight of Empire lay, took gentle rest: So did not Envy; but with haste arose; And as through Israels stately Towns she goes, She frowns and shakes her head; shine on (says she) Ruines e're long shall your sole Mon'uments be. The silver Moon with terrour paler grew, And neighbring Hermon sweated flowry dew; Swift Jordan started, and straight backward fled, Hiding among thick reeds his aged head; Lo, at her entrance Sauls strong Palace shook; And nimbly there the reverend shape she took Of Father Benjamin; so long her beard, So large her limbs, so grave her looks appear'd. Just like his statue which bestrid Sauls gate, And seem'd to guard the race it did create. In this known form she approacht the Tyrants side; And thus her words the sacred Form bely'd. Arise, lost King of Israel; can'st thou lie Dead in this sleep, and yet thy Last so nigh? If King thou be'est, if Jesses race as yit Sit not on Israels Throne! and shall he sit? Did ye for this from fruitful Egypt fly? From the mild Brickhils nobler slavery? For this did Seas your pow'erful Rod obey? Did Wonders guid, and feed you on your way? Could ye not there great Pharaohs bondage beare, You who can serve a Boy, and Minstrel here? Forbid it God, if thou be'st just; this shame Cast not on Sauls, on mine, and Israels Name. Why was I else from Canaans Famine lead? Happy, thrice happy had I there been dead Gen. 43. E're my full Loyns discharg'ed this num'erous race, This luckless Tribe, ev'en Crown'd to their Disgrace! Ah Saul, thy Servants Vassal must thou live? Place to his Harp must thy dread Scepter give? What wants he now but that? can'st thou forget (If thou be'st man thou can'st not) how they met The Youth with Songs? Alas, poor Monarch! you 1. Sam. 18. 7. Your thousand onely, he ten thousand slew! Him Isra'el loves, him neighbring Countreys fear; You but the Name, and empty Title bear; And yet the Traytor lives, lives in thy Court; The Court that must be his; where he shall sport Himself with all thy Concubines, thy Gold, Thy costly robes, thy Crown; Wert thou not told This by proud Samuel, when at Gilgal he 1. Sam. 13. 13. With bold false threats from God affronted Thee? The dotard ly'd; God said it not I know; Not Baal or Moloch would have us'd thee so; Was not the choice his own? did not thy worth Exact the royal Lot, and call it forth? Hast thou not since (my best and greatest Sonne) 1. Sam. 19. 21. To Him, and to his per'ishing Nation done Such lasting ben'efits as may justly claime A Scepter as eternal as thy Fame? Poor Prince, whom Madmen, Priests, and Boys invade! By thine own Flesh thy ingrateful Son betray'd! Unnat'ural Fool, who can thus cheated be By Friendships Name against a Crown and Thee! Betray not too thy self; take courage, call Thy 'enchanted Vertues forth, and be Whole Saul. Lo, this great cause makes thy dead Fathers rise, Breaks the firm Seals of their clos'd Tombs and Eyes. Nor can their jealous Ashes, whilst this Boy Survives, the Priv'iledge of their Graves enjoy. Rise quickly Saul, and take that Rebels breath Which troubles thus thy Life, and ev'en our Death. Kill him, and thou'rt secure; 'tis only He That's boldly interpos'd 'twixt God and Thee, As Earths low Globe robs the High Moon of Light; When this Eclypse is past, thy Fate's all bright. Trust me, dear Son, and credit what I tell; I 'have seen thy royal Stars, and know them well. Hence Fears and dull Delays! Is not thy Breast (Yes, Saul it is) with noble thoughts possest? May they beget like Acts. With that she takes One of her worst, her best beloved Snakes, Softly, dear Worm, soft and unseen (said she) Into his bosom steal, and in it be My Vice-Roy. At that word she took her flight, And her loose shape dissolv'd into the Night. The infected King leapt from his bed amaz'd, Scarce knew himself at first, but round him gaz'd, And started back at piec'd up shapes, which fear And his distracted Fancy painted there. Terror froze up his hair, and on his face Show'rs of cold sweat roll'd trembling down apace. Then knocking with his angry hands his breast, Earth with his feet; He crys, Oh 'tis confest; I' have been a pious fool, a Woman-King; Wrong'd by a Seer, a Boy, every thing. Eight hundred years of Death is not so deep, So unconcern'd as my Lethargick sleep. My Patience ev'en a Sacriledge becomes, Disturbs the Dead, and opes their sacred Tombs. Ah Benjamin, kind Father! who for me This cursed World endur'st again to see! All thou hast said, great Vision, is so true, That all which thou command'st, and more I'll do: Kill him? yes mighty Ghost the wretch shall dy, Though every Star in Heav'en should it deny; Nor mock th' assault of our just wrath again, Had he ten times his fam'd ten thousand slain. Should that bold popular Madman, whose design Is to revenge his own disgrace by Mine, 1 Sam. 8. 19. Should my ingrateful Son oppose th' intent, Should mine own heart grow scrup'ulous and relent. Curse me just Heaven (by which this truth I swear) If I that Seer, my Son, or Self do spare. No gentle Ghost, return to thy still home; Thither this day mine, and thy Foe shall come. If that curst object longer vex my sight, It must have learnt to 'appear as Thou to night. Whilst thus his wrath with threats the Tyrant fed, The threatned youth slept fearless on his bed; Sleep on, rest quiet as thy Conscience take, For though Thou sleep'st thy self, thy God's awake. Above the subtle foldings of the Sky, Above the well-set Orbs soft Harmony, Above those petty Lamps that guild the Night; There is a place o'reflown with hallowed Light; Where Heaven, as if it left it self behind, Is stretcht out far, nor its own bounds can find: Here peaceful Flames swell up the sacred place, Nor can the glory contain it self in th' endless space. For there no twilight of the Suns dull ray, Glimmers upon the pure and native day. No pale-fac'd Moon does in stoln beams appear, Or with dim Taper scatters darkness there. On no smooth Sphear the restless seasons slide, No circling Motion doth swift Time divide; Nothing is there To come, and nothing Past, But an Eternal Now does always last. There sits th' Almighty, First of all, and End; Whom nothing but Himself can comprehend. Who with his Word commanded All to Be, And All obey'd him, for that Word was He. Only he spoke, and every thing that Is From out the womb of fertile Nothing ris. Oh who shall tell, who shall describe thy throne, Thou Great Three-One? There Thou thy self do'st in full presence show, Not absent from these meaner Worlds below; No, if thou wert, the Elements League would cease, And all thy Creatures break thy Natures peace. The Sun would stop his course, or gallop back, The Stars drop out, the Poles themselves would crack: Earths strong foundations would be torn in twain, And this vast work all ravel out again To its first Nothing; For his spirit contains The well-knit Mass, from him each Creature gains Being and Motion, which he still bestows; From him th' effect of our weak Action flows. Round him vast Armies of swift Angels stand, Which seven triumphant Generals command, They sing loud anthems of his endless praise, And with fixt eyes drink in immortal rayes. Of these he call'd out one; all Heav'en did shake, And silence kept whilst its Creator spake. Are we forgotten then so soon? can He Look on his Crown, and not remember Me That gave it? can he think we did not hear (Fond Man!) his threats? and have we made the Ear To be accounted deaf? No, Saul, we heard; And it will cost thee dear; the ills thou'st fear'd, Practis'd, or thought on, I'll all double send; Have we not spoke it, and dares Man contend! Alas, poor dust! didst thou but know the day When thou must lie in blood at Gilboa, 1 Sam. 31. Thou, and thy Sons, thou wouldst not threaten still, Thy trembling Tongue would stop against thy will. Then shall thine Head fixt in curst Temples be, And all their foolish Gods shall laugh at Thee. That hand which now on Davids Life would prey, Shall then turn just, and its own Master slay; He whom thou hat'est, on thy lov'ed Throne shall sit, And expiate the disgrace thou do'st to it. Hast then; tell David what his King has sworn, Tell him whose blood must paint this rising Morn. Yet bid him go securely when he sends; 'Tis Saul that is his Foe, and we his Friends. The Man who has his God no aid can lack, And we who bid him Go, will bring him back. He spoke; the Heavens seem'd decently to bow, With all their bright Inhabitants; and now The jocond Sphaeres began again to play, Again each Spirit sung Halleluia. Only that Angel was strait gon; Ev'en so (But not so swift) the morning Glories flow At once from the bright Sun, and strike the ground; So winged Lightning the soft air does wound. Slow Time admires, and knows not what to call The Motion, having no Account so small. So flew this Angel, till to Davids bed He came, and thus his sacred Message said, Awake, young Man, hear what thy King has sworn; He swore thy blood should paint this rising Morn. Yet to him go securely when he sends; 'Tis Saul that is your Foe, and God your Friends. The Man who has his God, no aid can lack; And he who bids thee Go, will bring thee back. Up leapt Jessides, and did round him stare; But could see nought; for nought was left but air, Whilst this great Vision labours in his thought, Lo, the short Prophesie t'effect is brought. In treacherous hast he's sent for to the King, 1 Sam. 18. 10. &amp; 19. 9. And with him bid his charmful Lyre to bring. The King, they say, lies raging in a Fit, Which does no cure but sacred tunes admit; And true it was, soft musick did appease 1 Sam. 16. 23. Th'obscure fantastick rage of Sauls disease. Tell me, oh Muse (for Thou, or none canst tell The mystick pow'ers that in blest Numbers dwell, Thou their great Nature know'st, nor is it fit This noblest Gem of thine own Crown t' omit) Tell me from whence these heav'nly charms arise; Teach the dull world t'admire what they despise, As first a various unform'd Hint we find Rise in some god-like Poets fertile Mind, Till all the parts and words their places take, And with just marches verse and musick make; Such was Gods Poem, this Worlds new Essay; So wild and rude in its first draught it lay; Th' ungovern'd parts no Correspondence knew, An artless war from thwarting Motions grew; Till they to Number and fixt Rules were brought By the eternal Minds Poetique Thought. Water and Air he for the Tenor chose, Earth made the Base, the Treble Flame arose, To th' active Moon a quick brisk stroke he gave, To Saturns string a touch more soft and grave. The motions Strait, and Round, and Swift, and Slow, And Short, and Long, were mixt and woven so, Did in such artful Figures smoothly fall, As made this decent measur'd Dance of All. And this is Musick; Sounds that charm our ears, Are but one Dressing that rich Science wears. Though no man hear't, though no man it reherse, Yet will there still be Musick in my Verse. In this Great World so much of it we see; The Lesser, Man, is all o're Harmonie. Storehouse of all Proportions! single Quire! Which first Gods Breath did tunefully inspire! From hence blest Musicks heav'enly charms arise, From sympathy which Them and Man allies. Thus they our souls, thus they our Bodies win, Not by their Force, but Party that's within. Thus the strange Cure on our spilt Blood apply'd, Sympathy to the distant Wound does guid. Thus when two Brethren strings are set alike, To move them both, but one of them we strike, Thus Davids Lyre did Sauls wild rage controul. And tun'd the harsh disorders of his Soul. When Israel was from bondage led, Psal. 114. Led by th' Almighty's hand From out a forreign land, The great Sea beheld, and fled. As men pursu'd, when that fear past they find, Stop on some higher ground to look behind, So whilst through wondrous ways The sacred Army went, The Waves afar stood up to gaze, And their own Rocks did represent, Solid as Waters are above the Firmament. Old Jordans waters to their spring Start back with sudden fright; The spring amaz'd at sight, Asks what News from Sea they bring. The Mountains shook; and to the Mountains side, The little Hills leapt round themselves to hide; As young affrighted Lambs When they ought dreadful spy, Run trembling to their helpless Dams; The mighty Sea and River by, Were glad for their excuse to see the Hills to fly. What ail'd the mighty Sea to flee; Or why did Jordans tyde Back to his Fountain glide? Jordans Tyde, what ailed Thee? Why leapt the Hills? why did the Mountains shake? What ail'd them their fixt Natures to forsake? Fly where thou wilt, O Sea! And Jordans Current cease; Jordan there is no need of thee, For at Gods word, when e're he please, The Rocks shall weep new Waters forth instead of these. Exod. 17. 6. Num. 20. 11. Thus sung the great Musician to his Lyre; And Sauls black rage grew softly to retire; But Envys Serpent still with him remain'd, And the wise Charmers healthful voice disdain'd. Ps. 58. 5. Th' unthankful King cur'd truly of his fit, Seems to lie drown'd and buryed still in it. From his past madness draws this wicked use, To sin disguis'd, and murder with excuse: For whilst the fearless youth his cure pursues, And the soft Medicine with kind art renews; The barb'arous Patient casts at him his spear, 1 Sam. 18. 11. &amp; 19. 10. (The usual Scepter that rough hand did bear) Casts it with violent strength, but into th'roome An Arm more strong and sure then his was come; An Angel whose unseen and easie might Put by the weapon, and misled it right. How vain Mans pow'er is! unless God command, The weapon disobeys his Masters hand! Happy was now the error of the blow; At Gilboa it will not serve him so. One would have thought, Sauls sudden rage t'have seen, He had himself by David wounded been. He scorn'd to leave what he did ill begin, And thought his Honor now engag'ed i'th' Sin. A bloody Troop of his own Guards he sends (Slaves to his Will, and falsly call'ed his Friends) To mend his error by a surer blow, So Saul ordain'ed, but God ordain'ed not so. Home flies the Prince and to his trembling Wife Relates the new-past hazard of his life, Which she with decent passion hears him tell; For not her own fair Eyes she lov'ed so well. Upon their Palace top beneath a row Of Lemon Trees, which there did proudly grow, And with bright stores of golden fruit repay The Light they drank from the Suns neighb'ring ray, (A small, but artful Paradise) they walk'd; And hand in hand sad gentle things they talk'd. Here Michol first an armed Troop espies (So faithful and so quick are loving Eyes) Which marcht, and often glister'd through a wood, That on right hand of her fair Palace stood; She saw them; and cry'd out; They're come to kill 1 Sam. 19. 11. My dearest Lord; Sauls spear pursues thee still. Behold his wicked Guards; Haste quickly, fly, For heavens sake haste; My dear Lord, do not dy. Ah cruel Father, whose ill-natur'ed rage Neither thy Worth, nor Marriage can asswage! Will he part those he joyn'd so late before? Were the two-hundred Foreskins worth no more? 1 Sam. 18. 27. He shall not part us; (Then she wept between) At yonder Window thou mayst scape unseen; This hand shall let thee down; stay not, but hast; 'Tis not my Use to send thee hence so fast. Best of all women, he replies—and this Scarce spoke, she stops his answer with a Kiss; Throw not away (said she) thy precious breath, Thou stay'st too long within the reach of death. Timely he'obeys her wise advice, and streit To unjust Force she'opposes just deceit. She meets the Murd'erers with a vertuous Ly, 1 Sam. 19. 13. And good dissembling Tears; May he not dy In quiet then? (said she) will they not give 1 Sam. 19. 14. That freedom who so fear lest he should Live? Even fate does with your cruelty conspire, And spares your guilt, yet does what you desire. Must he not live? for that ye need not sin; My much-wrong'd Husband speechless lies within, And has too little left of vital breath To know his Murderers, or to feel his Death. One hour will do your work— Here her well-govern'd Tears dropt down apace; Beauty and Sorrow mingled in one face Has such resistless charms that they believe, And an unwilling aptness find to grieve At what they came for; A pale Statues head In linnen wrapt appear'd on Davids bed; Two servants mournful stand and silent by, And on the table med'cinal reliques ly; In the close room a well-plac'ed Tapers light, Adds a becoming horror to the sight. And for th' Impression God prepar'ed their Sence; They saw, believ'd all this, and parted thence. How vain attempts Sauls unblest anger tryes, By his own hands deceiv'd, and servants Eyes! It cannot be (said he) no, can it? shall Our great ten thousand Slayer idly fall? The silly rout thinks God protects him still; But God, alas, guards not the bad from ill. Oh may he guard him! may his members be In as full strength, and well-set harmonie As the fresh body of the first made Man E're Sin, or Sins just meed, Disease began. He will be else too small for our vast Hate; And we must share in our revenge with fate. No; let us have him Whole; we else may seem To'have snatcht away but some few days from him, And cut that Thread which would have dropt in two; Will our great anger learn to stoop so low? I know it cannot, will not; him we prize Of our just wrath the solemn Sacrifice, That must not blemisht be; let him remain Secure, and grow up to our stroke again. 'Twill be some pleasure then to take his breath, When he shall strive, and wrestle with his death; Go, let him live—And yet—shall I then stay So long? good and great actions hate delay. Some foolish piety perhaps, or He That has been still mine honors Enemie, Samuel may change or cross my just intent, And I this Formal Pity soon repent. Besides Fate gives him me, and whispers this, That he can fly no more, if we should miss; Miss? can we miss again; go bring him strait, Though gasping out his Soul; if the wisht date 1 Sam. 19. 15. Of his accursed life be almost past, Some Joy 'twill be to see him breath his last. The Troop return'd, of their short Virtue' asham'ed, Sauls courage prais'd, and their own weakness blam'ed, But when the pious fraud they understood, Scarce the respect due to Sauls sacred blood, Due to the sacred beauty in it reign'ed, From Michols murder their wild rage restrain'ed. She'alleag'ed the holiest chains that bind a wife, Duty and Love; she alleag'ed that her own Life, 1 Sam. 19. 17. Had she refus'ed that safety to her Lord, Would have incurr'd just danger from his sword. Now was Sauls wrath full grown; he takes no rest; A violent Flame rolls in his troubled brest, And in fierce Lightning from his Eye do's break; Not his own fav'orites, and best friends dare speak, Or look on him; but mute and trembling all, Fear where this Cloud will burst, and Thunder fall. So when the pride and terrour of the Wood, A Lyon prickt with rage and want of food, Espies out from afar some well-fed beast, And brustles up preparing for his feast; If that by swiftness scape his gaping jaws; His bloody eyes he hurls round, his sharp paws Tear up the ground; then runs he wild about, Lashing his angry tail, and roaring out. Beasts creep into their dens, and tremble there; Trees, though no wind stirring, shake with feare; Silence and horror fill the place around. Eccho it self dares scarce repeat the sound. Midst a large Wood that joyns fair Ramahs Town 1 Sam. 19. 19. (The neighbourhood fair Rama's chief renown) A College stands, where at great Prophets feet The Prophets Sons with silent dili'gence meet, By Samuel built, and mod'erately endow'ed, Yet more to' his lib'ral Tongue then Hands they ow'ed: There himself taught, and his blest voice to heare, Teachers themselves lay proud beneath him there. The House was a large Square; but plain and low; Wise Natures use Art strove not to outgo. An inward Square by well-rang'd Trees was made; And midst the friendly cover of their shade, A pure, well-tasted, wholsome Fountain rose; Which no vain cost of Marble did enclose; Nor through carv'd shapes did the forc'ed waters pass, Shapes gazing on themselves i'th' liquid glass. Yet the chaste stream that 'mong loose peebles fell For Cleanness, Thirst, Religion serv'd as well. The Schollars, Doctors and Companions here, Lodg'ed all apart in neat small chambers were: Well-furnisht-Chambers, for in each there stood, A narrow Couch, Table and Chair of wood; More is but clog where use does bound delight; And those are rich whose Wealth's proportion'ed right To their Lifes Form; more goods would but becom A Burden to them, and contract their room. A second Court more sacred stood behind, Built fairer, and to nobler use design'd: The Halls and Schools one side of it possest; The Library and Synagogue the rest. Tables of plain-cut Firre adorn'ed the Hall; And with beasts skins the beds were cov'red all. The reverend Doctors take their seats on high, Th' Elect Companions in their bosoms ly. The Schollars far below upon the ground, On fresh-strew'd rushes place themselves around. With more respect the wise and ancient lay; But eat not choicer Herbs or Bread then they, Nor purer Waters drank, their constant feast; But by great days, and Sacrifice encreast. The Schools built round and higher, at the end With their fair circle did this side extend; To which their Synagogue on th'other side, And to the Hall their Library replide. The midst tow'ards their large Gardens open lay, To'admit the joys of Spring and early day. I'th' Library a few choice Authors stood; Yet 'twas well stor'ed, for that small store was good; Writing, Mans Spir'itual Physick was not then It self, as now, grown a Disease of Men. Learning (young Virgin) but few Suitors knew; The common Prostitute she lately grew, And with her spurious brood loads now the Press; Laborious effects of Idleness! Here all the various forms one might behold How Letters sav'd themselves from Death of old; Some painfully engrav'ed in thin wrought plates, Some cut in wood, some lightlier trac'ed on slates; Some drawn on fair Palm leaves, with short-live'd toyl, Had not their friend the Cedar lent his Oyl. Some wrought in Silks, some writ in tender barks; Some the sharp Stile in waxen Tables marks; Some in beasts skins, and some in Biblos reed; Both new rude arts, with age and growth did need. The Schools were painted well with useful skill; Stars, Maps, and Stories the learn'd wall did fill. Wise wholesome Proverbs mixt around the roome, Some writ, and in Egyptian Figures some. Here all the noblest Wits of men inspir'ed, From earths slight joys, and worthless toils retir'ed, Whom Samuels Fame and Bounty thither lead, Each day by turns their solid knowledge read. The course and power of Stars great Nathan thought, And home to man those distant Wonders brought, How toward both Poles the Suns fixt journey bends, And how the Year his crooked walk attends. By what just steps the wandring Lights advance, And what eternal measures guid their dance. Himself a Prophet; but his Lectures shew'ed How little of that Art to them he ow'ed. Mahol th'inferior worlds fantastick face, Though all the turns of Matters Maze did trace, Great Natures well-set Clock in pieces took; On all the Springs and smallest Wheels did look Of Life and Motion; and with equal art Made up again the Whole of ev'ry Part. The Prophet Gad in learned Dust designes Th'immortal solid rules of fanci'ed Lines. Of Numbers too th' unnumbred wealth he showes, And with them far their endless journey goes. Numbers which still encrease more high and wide From One, the root of their turn'd Pyramide. Of Men, and Ages past Seraiah read; Embalm'd in long-liv'd History the Dead. Show'd the steep falls, and slow ascent of States; What Wisdom and what Follies make their Fates. Samuel himself did Gods rich Law display; Taught doubting men with Judgment to obay. And oft his ravisht Soul with sudden flight Soar'd above present Times, and humane sight. These Arts but welcome strangers might appear, Musick and Verse seem'd born and bred up here; Scarce the blest Heav'en that rings with Angels voyce, Does more with constant Harmony rejoyce. The sacred Muse does here each brest inspire; Heman, and sweet-mouth'd Asaph rule their Quire: Both charming Poets, and all strains they plaid, By artful Breath, or nimble Fingers made. The Synagogue was drest with care and cost, (The onely place where that they'esteem'd not lost) The glittering roof with gold did daze the view, The sides refresh't with silks of sacred blew. Here thrice each day they read their perfect Law, Thrice pray'ers from willing Heav'en a blessing draw; Thrice in glad Hymns swell'd with the Great Ones praise, The plyant Voice on her sev'en steps they raise, Whilst all th' enlivened Instruments around To the just feet with various concord sound; Such things were Muses then, contemn'd low earth; Decently proud, and mindful of their birth. 'Twas God himself that here tun'ed every Toung; And gratefully of him alone they sung. They sung how God spoke out the worlds vast ball; From Nothing, and from No where call'd forth All. No Nature yet, or place for't to possess, But an unbottom'ed Gulf of Emptiness. Full of Himself, th' Almighty sat, his own Palace, and without Solitude Alone. But he was Goodness whole, and all things will'd; Which ere they were, his active word fulfill'd; And their astonisht heads o'th' sudden rear'ed; An unshap'ed kind of Something first appear'ed, Confessing its new Being, and undrest As if it stept in hast before the rest. Yet buried in this Matters darksome womb, Lay the rich Seeds of ev'ery thing to com. From hence the chearful Flame leapt up so high; Close at its heels the nimble Air did fly; Dull Earth with his own weight did downwards pierce To the fixt Navel of the Universe, And was quite lost in waters: till God said To the proud Sea, shrink in your ins'olent head, See how the gaping Earth has made you place; That durst not murmure, but shrunk in apace. Since when his bounds are set, at which in vain He foams, and rages, and turns back again. With richer stuff he bad Heav'ens fabrick shine, And from him a quick spring of Light divine Swell'd up the Sun, from whence his cher'ishing flame Fills the whole world, like Him from whom it came. He smooth'd the rough-cast Moons imperfect mold, And comb'ed her beamy locks with sacred gold; Be thou (said he) Queen of the mournful night, And as he spoke, she' arose clad o're in Light, With thousand stars attending on her train; With her they rise, with her they set again. Then Herbs peep'ed forth, new Trees admiring stood, And smelling Flow'ers painted the infant wood. Then flocks of Birds through the glad ayr did flee, Joyful, and safe before Mans Luxurie, Teaching their Maker in their untaught lays: Nay the mute Fish witness no less his praise. For those he made, and cloath'd with silver scales; From Minoes to those living Islands, Whales. Beasts too were his command: what could he more? Yes, Man he could, the bond of all before; In him he all things with strange order hurl'd; In him, that full Abridgment of the World. This, and much more of Gods great works they told; His mercies, and some judgments too of old: How when all earth was deeply stain'd in sin; With an impetuous noyse the waves came rushing in. Where birds e're while dwelt, and securely sung; There Fish (an unknown Net) entangled hung. The face of shi[pw]rackt Nature naked lay; The Sun peep'd forth, and beheld nought but Sea. This men forgot, and burnt in lust again; Till show'rs, strange as their Sin, of fiery rain, And scalding brimstone, dropt on Sodoms head; Alive they felt those Flames they fry in Dead. No better end rash Pharaohs pride befel When wind and Sea wag'ed war for Israel. In his gilt chariots amaz'ed fishes sat, And grew with corps of wretched Princes fat. The waves and rocks half-eaten bodies stain; Nor was it since call'd the Red-sea in vain. Much too they told of faithful Abrams fame, To whose blest passage they owe still their Name: Of Moses much, and the great seed of Nun; What wonders they perform'd, what lands they won. How many Kings they slew or Captive brought; They held the Swords, but God and Angels fought. Thus gain'd they the wise spending of their days; And their whole Life was their dear Makers praise. No minutes rest, no swiftest thought they sold To that beloved Plague of Mankind, Gold. Gold for which all mankind with greater pains Labour towards Hell, then those who dig its veins. Their wealth was the Contempt of it; which more They valu'd then rich fools the shining Ore. The Silk-worm's pretious death they scorn'd to wear, And Tyrian Dy appear'd but sordid there. Honor, which since the price of Souls became, Seem'd to these great ones a low idle Name. Instead of Down, hard beds they chose to have, Such as might bid them not forget their Grave. Their Board dispeopled no full Element, Free Natures bounty thriftily they spent And spar'ed the Stock; nor could their bodies say We owe this Crudeness t'Excess yesterday. Thus Souls live cleanly, and no soiling fear, But entertain their welcome Maker there. The Senses perform nimbly what they're bid, And honestly, nor are by Reason chid. And when the Down of sleep does softly fall, Their Dreams are heavenly then, and mystical. With hasty wings Time present they outfly, And tread the doubtful Maze of Destiny. There walk and sport among the years to come; And with quick Eye pierce ev'ery Causes womb. Thus these wise Saints enjoy'd their Little All; Free from the spight of much-mistaken Saul: For if mans Life we in just ballance weight, David deserv'd his Envy less then They. Of this retreat the hunted Prince makes choice, Adds to their Quire his nobler Lyre and Voyce. But long unknown even here he could not lye; So bright his Lustre, so quick Envies Eye! Th'offended Troop, whom he escap'ed before, 1 Sam. 19. 20. Pursue him here, and fear mistakes no more; Belov'ed revenge fresh rage to them affords; Some part of him all promise to their Swords. They came, but a new spirit their hearts possest, Scatt'ring a sacred calm through every brest: The furrows of their brow, so rough erewhile, Sink down into the dimples of a Smile. Their cooler veins swell with a peaceful tide, And the chaste streams with even current glide. A sudden day breaks gently through their eyes, And Morning-blushes in their cheeks arise. The thoughts of war, of blood, and murther cease; In peaceful tunes they adore the God of Peace. New Messengers twice more the Tyrant sent, Ib. v. 21. And was twice more mockt with the same event. His heightned rage no longer brooks delay; It sends him there himself; but on the way His foolish Anger a wise Fury grew, Ib. v. 23. And Blessings from his mouth unbidden flew. His Kingly robes he laid at Naioth down, Began to understand and scorn his Crown; Employ'd his mounting thoughts on nobler things; And felt more solid joys then Empire brings. Embrac'ed his wondring Son, and on his head The balm of all past wounds, kind Tears he shed. So cov'etous Balam with a fond intent Num. 22. Of cursing the blest Seed, to Moab went. But as he went his fatal tongue to sell; His Ass taught him to speak, God to speak well. Ib. v. 28. How comely are thy Tents, oh Israel! Num. 24. 5. (Thus he began) what conquests they foretel! Less fair are Orchards in their autumn pride, Adorn'd with Trees on some fair Rivers side. Less fair are Valleys their green mantles spread! Or Mountains with tall Cedars on their head! 'Twas God himself (thy God who must not fear?) Brought thee from Bondage to be Master here. Slaughter shall wear out these; new Weapons get; And Death in triumph on thy darts shall sit. When Judahs Lyon starts up to his prey, The Beasts shall hang their ears, and creep away. When he lies down, the Woods shall silence keep, And dreadful Tygers tremble at his sleep. Thy Cursers, Jacob, shall twice cursed be; And he shall bless himself that blesses Thee. DAVIDEIS. The second Book. THE CONTENTS. The Friendship betwixt Jonathan and David; and upon that occasion a digression concerning the nature of Love. A discourse between Jonathan and David, upon which the latter absents himself from Court, and the former goes thither, to inform himself of Sauls resolution. The Feast of the New-Moon, the manner of the Celebration of it; and therein a Digression of the History of Abraham. Sauls Speech upon Davids absence from the Feast, and his anger against Jonathan. Davids resolution to fly away; he parts with Jonathan, and falls asleep under a Tree. A Description of Phansie; an Angel makes up a Vision in Davids head; the Vision it self, which is, A Prophesie of all the succession of his Race till Christs time, with their most remarkable actions. At his awaking, Gabriel assumes an humane shape, and confirms to him the truth of his Vision. But now the early birds began to call The morning forth; up rose the Sun and Saul; Both, as men thought, rose fresh from sweet repose; But both, alas, from restless labours rose. For in Sauls breast, Envy, the toilsome Sin, Had all that night active and ty'rannous bin, She'expell'd all forms of Kindness, Vertue, Grace; Of the past day no footstep left or trace. The new-blown sparks of his old rage appear, Nor could his Love dwell longer with his fear. So near a storm wise David would not stay, Nor trust the glittering of a faithless Day. He saw the Sun call in his beams apace, And angry Clouds march up into their place. The Sea it self smooths his rough brow awhile, Flattering the greedy Merchant with a smile; But he, whose ship-wrackt Barque it drank before, Sees the deceit, and knows it would have more. Such is the Sea, and such was Saul. But Jonathan, his Son, and Only Good, Was gentle as fair Jordans useful Flood. Whose innocent stream as it in silence goes, Fresh Honours, and a sudden spring bestows On both his banks to every flower and tree; The manner How lies hid, th'effect we see. But more than all, more than Himself he lov'ed The man whose worth his Fathers Hatred mov'ed. For when the noble youth at Dammin stood Adorn'd with sweat, and painted gay with Blood, Jonathan pierce'd him through with greedy Eye And understood the future Majestie 1 Sam. 18. 1. Then destin'ed in the glories of his look; He saw, and strait was with amazement strook, To see the strength, the feature, and the grace Of his young limbs; he saw his comely face Where Love and Rev'erence so well mingled were; And Head, already crown'd with golden haire. He saw what Mildness his bold Sp'irit did tame, Gentler then Light, yet powerful as a Flame. He saw his Valour by their Safety prov'ed; He saw all this, and as he saw, he Lov'ed. What art thou, Love, thou great mysterious thing? From what hid stock does thy strange Nature spring? 'Tis thou that mov'est the world through every part And holdst the vast frame close, that nothing start From the due Place and Office first ordain'd. By Thee were all things Made, and are sustain'd. Sometimes we see thee fully, and can say From hence thou took'est thy Rise, and went'st that way; But oftner the short beams of Reasons Eye, See onely, There thou art, nor How, nor Why. How is the Loadstone, Natures subtle pride, By the rude Iron woo'd, and made a Bride? How was the Weapon wounded? what hid Flame The strong and conqu'ering Metal overcame? Love (this Worlds Grace) exalts his Natural state; He feels thee, Love, and feels no more his Weight. Ye learned Heads, whom Ivy garlands grace, Why does that twining plant the Oak embrace? The Oak for courtship most of all unfit, And rough as are the Winds that fight with it? How does the absent Pole the Needle move? How does his Cold and Ice beget hot Love? Which are the Wings of Lightness to ascend? Or why does Weight to th' Centre downwards bend? Thus Creatures void of Life obey thy Laws, And seldom We, they never know the Cause. In thy large state, Life gives the next degree, Where Sense, and Good Apparent places thee; But thy chief Palace is Mans Heart alone, Here are thy Triumphs, and full glories shown, Handsome Desires, and Rest about thee flee, Union, Inhærence, Zeal, and Extasie. Thousand with Joys cluster around thine head, O're which a gall-less Dove her wings does spread, A gentle Lamb, purer and whiter farre Then Consciences of thine own Martyrs are, Lies at thy feet; and thy right hand does hold The mystick Scepter of a Cross of Gold. Thus do'est thou sit (like Men e're sin had fram'ed A guilty blush) Naked, but not Asham'ed. What cause then did the fab'ulous Ancients find, When first their superstition made thee blind? 'Twas They, alas, 'twas They who could not see, When they mistook that Monster, Lust, for Thee. Thou art a bright, but not consuming Flame; Such in th'amazed Bush to Moses came; Exo. 3. 1. When that secure its new-crown'd head did rear, And chid the trembling Branches needless fear. Thy Darts of healthful Gold, and downwards fall Soft as the Feathers that they're fletcht withal. Such, and no other, were those secret Darts, Which sweetly toucht this noblest pair of Hearts. Still to one end they both so justly drew, As courteous Doves together yok'd would do. No weight of Birth did on one side prevaile, Two Twins less even lie in Natures Scale. They mingled Fates, and both in each did share, They both were Servants, they both Princes were. If any Joy to one of them was sent, It was most his, to whom it least was meant, And fortunes malice betwixt both was crost, For striking one, it wounded th'other most. Never did Marriage such true Union find, Or mens desires with so glad violence bind; For there is still some tincture left of Sin, And still the Sex will needs be stealing in. Those joys are full of dross, and thicker farre, These, without matter, clear and liquid are. Such sacred Love does he'avens bright Spirits fill, Where Love is but to Understand and Will, With swift and unseen Motions; such as We Somewhat express in heightned Charitie. O ye blest One! whose Love on earth became So pure that still in Heav'en 'tis but the same! There now ye sit, and with mixt souls embrace, Gazing upon great Loves mysterious Face, And pity this base world where Friendship's made A bait for sin, or else at best a Trade. Ah wondrous Prince! who a true Friend could'st be, When a Crown Flatter'ed, and Saul threatned Thee! Who held'st him dear, whose Stars thy birth did cross! And bought'st him nobly at a Kingdoms loss! Isra'els bright Scepter far less glory brings; There have been fewer Friends on earth then Kings. To this strange pitch their high affections flew; Till Natures self scarce look'd on them as Two. Hither flies David for advice and ayde, 1 Sam. 20. 1. As swift as Love and Danger could perswade, As safe in Jonathans trust his thoughts remain As when Himself but dreams them o're again. My dearest Lord, farewel (said he) farewel; He'aven bless the King; may no misfortune tell Th'injustice of his hate, when I am dead; They'are coming now, perhaps; my guiltless head Here in your sight, perhaps, must bleeding ly, And scarce your own stand safe for being nigh. Think me not scar'ed with death, howere't appear, I know thou can'st not think so: tis a fear From which thy Love, and Dammin speaks me free; I'have met him face to face, and ne're could see One terrour in his looks to make me fly When Vertue bids me stand; but I would dy So as becomes my Life, so as may prove Sauls Malice, and at least excuse your Love. He stopt, and spoke some passion with his eyes; Excellent Friend (the gallant Prince replyes) Thou hast so prov'd thy Virtues, that they're known To all good men, more then to each his own. Who lives in Israel, that can doubtful be Of thy great actions? for he lives by Thee. Such is thy Valour, and thy vast success, That all things but thy Loyalty are less. And should my Father at thy ruine aim, 'Twould wound as much his Safety as his Fame. Think them not coming then to slay thee here, But doubt mishaps, as little as you feare. For by thy loving God who e're design Against thy Life must strike at it through Mine. But I my royal Father must acquit From such base guilt, or the low thought of it. Think on his softness when from death he freed The faithless King of Am'alecks cursed seed; 1 Sam. 15. 9. Can he to'a Friend, to'a Son so bloudy grow, He who ev'n sin'd but now to spare a Foe? Admit he could; but with what strength or art Could he so long close, and seal up his heart? Such counsels jealous of themselves become, And dare not fix without consent of some. Few men so boldly ill, great sins to do, Till licens'ed and approv'ed by others too. No more (believe't) could he hide this from me, 1 Sam. 20. 2. Then I, had he discover'd it, from Thee. Here they embraces join, and almost tears; Till gentle David thus new prov'd his fears. The praise you pleas'd (great Prince) on me to spend Was all out-spoken when you stil'd me Friend. That name alone does dang'erous glories bring, And gives excuse to th' Envy of a King, What did his Spear, force, and dark plots impart But some eternal rancour in his heart? Still does he glance the fortune of that day When drown'd in his own blood Goliah lay, And cover'd half the plain; still hears the sound How that vast Monster fell, and strook the ground: The Dance, and, David his ten thousand slew, Still wound his sickly soul, and still are new. Great acts t'ambitious Princes Treasons grow, So much they hate that Safety which they ow. Tyrants dread all whom they raise high in place, From the Good, danger; from the Bad, disgrace. They doubt the Lords, mistrust the Peoples hate, Till Blood become a Principle of State. Secur'd nor by their Guards, nor by their Right, But still they Fear ev'en more then they Affright. Pardon me, Sir, your Father's rough and stern: His Will too strong to bend, too proud to learn. Remember, Sir, the Honey's deadly sting; Think on that savage Justice of the King. When the same day that saw you do before Things above Man, should see you Man no more. 'Tis true th'accursed Agag mov'ed his ruth, He pitied his tall Limbs and comely youth Had seen, alas the proof of heav'ens fierce hate, And fear'd no mischief from his powerless fate. Remember how th'old Seer came raging down, And taught him boldly to suspect his Crown. Since then his pride quakes at th' Almighties rod, Nor dares he love the man belov'ed by God. Hence his deep rage and trembling Envy springs; Nothing so wild as Jealousie of Kings. Whom should he counsel ask, with whom advise, Who Reason and Gods counsel does despise? Whose head-strong will no Law or Conscience daunt, Dares he not sin, do'you think, without your grant? Yes, if the truth of our fixt love he knew, He would not doubt, believe't, to kill ev'en you. The Prince is mov'ed, and straight prepares to find The deep resolves of his griev'd Fathers mind. The danger now appears, Love can soon show't, And force his Stubborn piety to know't. They 'agree that David should conceal'd abide, 1 Sam. 20. 5. &amp;c. Till his great friend had the Courts temper tryde, Till he had Sauls most secret purpose found, And searcht the depth and rancour of his wound. 'Twas the years seventh-born Moon; the solemn Feast Lev. 23. 24. Nu. 26. 1. That with most noise its sacred mirth exprest. From op'ening Morn till night shuts in the day, On Trumpets and shrill Horns the Levites play. Whether by this in mystick Type we see The New-years-Day of great Eternitie, When the chang'd Moon shall no more changes make, And scatter'd Deaths by Trumpets sound awake; Or that the Law be kept in Mem'ory still, Exo. 19. 19. Giv'en with like noise on Sina's shining Hill, Or that (as some men teach) it did arise From faithful Abrams righteous Sacrifice, Who whilst the Ram on Isaac's fire did fry, His Horn with joyful tunes stood sounding by. Obscure the Cause; but God his will declar'ed; And all nice knowledge then with ease is spar'ed. At the third hour Saul to the hallowed Tent Midst a large train of Priests and Courtiers went; The sacred Herd marcht proud and softly by; Too fat and gay to think their deaths so nigh. Hard fate of Beasts, more innocent than We! Prey to our Lux'ury, and our Pietie! Whose guiltless blood on boards and Altars spilt, Serves both to Make, and Expiate too our guilt! Three Bullocks of free neck, two guilded Rams, Two well-washt Goats, and fourteen spotless Lambs, With the three vital fruits, Wine, Oyl, and Bread, (Small fees to heav'en of all by which we're fed) Are offer'ed up; the hallowed flames arise, And faithful pray'rs mount with them to the skies. From thence the King to th'outmost Court is brought, Where heav'enly things an inspir'ed Prophet taught, And from the sacred Tent to 'his Palace gates, With glad kind shouts th' Assembly on him waites; The chearful Horns before him loudly play, And fresh-strew'd flowers paint his triumphant way. Thus in slow state to th' Palace Hall they go, Rich drest for solemn Luxury and Show; Ten pieces of bright Tap'estry hung the room, The noblest work e're stretcht on Syrian loom; For wealthy Adri'el in proud Sydon wrought And giv'en to Saul when Sauls best gift he sought 1 Sam. 18. 19. The bright-ey'd Merab; for that mindful day No ornament so proper seem'd as they. There all old Abrams story you might see; And still some Angel bore him companie. His painful, but well-guided Travels, show The fate of all his Sons, the Church below. Here beauteous Sara to great Pharo came, Gen. 21. 14. He blusht with sudden passion, she with shame; Troubled she seem'd, and lab'oring in the strife 'Twixt her own Honor, and her Husbands Life. Here on a conqu'ering Host that careless lay, Drown'd in the joys of their new gotten prey, Gen. 14. The Patriarch falls; well mingled might you see The confus'd marks of Death and Luxury. In the next piece blest Salems mystick King Gen. 14. 18. Does sacred Presents to the Victor bring; Like him whose Type he bears, his rights receives; Strictly requires his Due, yet freely gives. Ev'en in his port, his habit, and his face; The Mild, and Great, the Priest and Prince had place. Here all their starry host the heavens display; Gen. 15. 5. And, Lo, an heav'enly Youth, more fair then they, Leads Abram forth; points upwards; such, said he, So bright and numberless thy Seed shall be. Here he with God a new Alliance makes, Gen. 17. And in his flesh the marks of Homage takes; Here he the three mysterious persons feasts, Gen. 18. 2. Ver. 10. Well paid with joyful tidings by his Guests. Here for the wicked Town he prays, and near Gen. 18. 23. Gen. 19. 24. Scarce did the wicked Town through Flames appear. And all his Fate, and all his Deeds were wrought, Since he from Gen. 11. 31. Ur to Gen. 25. 9. Ephrons cave was brought. But none 'mongst all the forms drew then their eyes Like faithful Abrams righteous Sacrifice. Gen. 22. Ver. 3. The sad old man mounts slowly to the place, With Natures power triumphant in his face O're the Minds courage; for in spight of all From his swoln eyes resistless waters fall. The inn'ocent Boy his cruel burthen bore Ver. 6. With smiling looks, and sometimes walk'd before, And sometimes turn'd to talk; above was made The Altars fatal Pile, and on it laid Ver. 9. The Hope of Mankind; patiently he lay, And did his Syre, as he his God, obey. The mournful Syre lifts up at last the knife, And on one moments string depends his life Ver. 10. In whose young loyns such brooding wonders ly. A thousand Spir'its peep'd from th'affrighted sky, Amaz'ed at this strange Scene; and almost fear'd, For all those joyful Prophesies they'd heard. Till one leapt nimbly forth by Gods command Ver. 11. Like Lightning from a Cloud, and stopt his hand. The gentle Spirit smil'ed kindly as he spoke, New beames of joy through Abrams wonder broke. The Angel points to'a tuft of bushes near, Ver. 13. Where an entangled Ram does half appear, And struggles vainly with that fatal net, Which though but slightly wrought, was firmly set. For, lo, anon, to this sad glory doom'd, The useful Beast on Isaac's Pile consum'ed; Whilst on his Horns the ransom'ed couple plaid, And the glad Boy danc'd to the tunes he made. Near this Halls end a Shittim Table stood; Yet well-wrought plate strove to conceal the wood. For from the foot a golden vine did sprout, And cast his fruitful riches all about. Well might that beauteous Ore the Grape express, Which does weak Man intoxicate no less. Of the same wood the guilded beds were made, And on them large embroidered carpets laid, From Egypt the rich shop of Follies brought, But Arts of Pride all Nations soon are taught. Behold sev'en comely blooming Youths appear, And in their hands sev'en silver washpots bear, Curl'd, and gay clad; the choicest Sons that be Of Gibeons race, and Slaves of high degree. Seven beauteous Maids marcht softly in behind; Bright scarfs their cloathes, their hair fresh Garlands bind, And whilst the Princes wash, they on them shed Rich Oyntments, which their costly odours spread O're the whole room; from their small prisons free With such glad haste through the wide ayr they flee. The King was plac'ed alone, and o're his head 1 Sam. 20. 25. A well-wrought Heav'en of silk and gold was spread. Azure the ground, the Sun in gold shone bright, But pierc'd the wandring Clouds with silver light. The right hand bed the Kings three Sons did grace, The third was Abners, Adriels, Davids place. And twelve large Tables more were fill'd below, With the prime men Sauls Court and Camp could show; The Palace did with mirth and musick sound, And the crown'd goblets nimbly mov'ed around. But though bright joy in every guest did shine, The plenty, state, musick, and sprightful wine Were lost on Saul; an angry care did dwell In his dark brest, and all gay forms expell. Davids unusual absence from the feast, 1 Sam. 20. 26. 27. To his sick spir'it did jealous thoughts suggest. Long lay he still, nor drank, nor eat, nor spoke, And thus at last his troubled silence broke. Where can he be? said he; It must be so: With that he paused awhile; Too well we know His boundless pride: he grieves and hates to see The solemn triumphs of my Court and Me. Believe me, friends, and trust what I can show From thousand proofs, th'ambitious David now Does those vast things in his proud soul design That too much business give for Mirth or Wine. He's kindling now perhaps, rebellious fire Among the Tribes, and does ev'n now conspire Against my Crown, and all our Lives, whilst we Are loth ev'en to suspect, what we might See. By the Great Name, 'tis true. With that he strook the board, and no man there But Jonathan durst undertake to clear 1 Sam. 20. 28. 29. The blameless Prince; and scarce ten words he spoke, When thus his speech th'enraged Tyrant broke. V. 30. 31. Disloyal Wretch! thy gentle Mothers shame! Whose cold pale Ghost ev'en blushes at thy name! Who fears lest her chast bed should doubted be, And her white fame stain'd by black deeds of thee! Can'st thou be Mine? a Crown sometimes does hire Ev'en Sons against their Parents to conspire, But ne're did story yet, or fable tell Of one so wild, who meerly to Rebel Quitted th'unquestion'd birthright of a Throne, And bought his Fathers ruine with his own: Thou need'st not plead th'ambitious youths defence; Thy crime clears his, and makes that Innocence. Nor can his foul Ingratitude appear, Whilst thy unnatural guilt is plac'ed so near. Is this that noble Friendship you pretend? Mine, thine own Foe, and thy worst En'emies Friend? If thy low spirit can thy great birthright quit, The thing's but just, so ill deserv'est thou it. I, and thy Brethren here have no such mind; Nor such prodigious worth in David find, That we to him should our just rights resign, Or think Gods choice not made so well as Thine. Shame of thy House and Tribe! hence, from mine Eye, To thy false Friend, and servile Master fly; He's e're this time in arms expecting thee; Haste, for those arms are rais'ed to ruine Mee. Thy sin that way will nobler much appear, Then to remain his Spy and Agent here. When I think this, Nature by thee forsook, Forsakes me too. With that his spear he took To strike at him; the mirth and musick cease; The guests all rise this sudden storm t'appease; Ver. 33. The Prince his danger, and his duty knew; Ver. 34. And low he bow'd, and silently withdrew. To David strait, who in a forest nigh Ver. 35. Waits his advice, the royal Friend does fly. The sole advice, now like the danger clear, Was in some foreign land this storm t'outwear. All marks of comely grief in both are seen; And mournful kind discourses past between. Now generous tears their hasty tongues restrain, Ver. 42. Now they begin, and talk all o're again A reverent Oath of constant love they take, Ver. 42. And Gods high name their dreaded witness make; Not that at all their Faiths could doubtful prove; But 'twas the tedious zeal of endless Love. Thus e're they part, they the short time bestow In all the pomp Friendship and Grief could show. And David now with doubtful cares opprest, Beneath a shade borrows some little rest; When by command divine thick mists arise, And stop the Sense, and close the conque'red eyes. There is a place which Man most high doth rear, The small Worlds Heav'en, where Reason moves the Sphære. Here in a robe which does all colours show, (The envy of birds, and the clouds gawdy bow) Phansie, wild Dame, with much lascivious pride By twin-Chamelions drawn, does gaily ride. Her coach there follows, and throngs round about Of shapes and airy Forms an endless rout. A Sea rowls on with harmless fury here; Straight 'tis a field, and trees and herbs appeare. Here in a moment are vast Armies made, And a quick Scene of war and blood displaid. Here sparkling wines, and brighter Maids come in, The bawds for sense and lying baits of sin. Some things arise of strange and quarr'elling kind, The forepart Lyon, and a Snake behind; Here golden mountains swell the cove'tous place, And Cenatures ride Themselves a painted race. Of these slight wonders Nature sees the store, And onely then accounts herself but poore. Hither an Angel comes in Davids trance; And finds them mingled in an antique dance; Of all the numerous forms fit choice he takes, And joyns them wisely, and this Vision makes. First David there appears in Kingly state, Whilst the twelve Tribes his dread commands await; Straight to the wars with his joyn'd strength he goes, 2 Sam. 5. 1. 1 Chro. 12. 23. Ver. 6. Settles new friends, and frights his ancient Foes. To Solima, Cana'ans old head, they came, (Since high in note, then not unknown to Fame) The Blind and Lame th'undoubted wall defend, 2 Sam. 5. 6. And no new wounds or dangers apprehend. The busie image of great Joab there Disdains the mock, and teaches them to fear. He climbs the airy walls, leaps raging down, New-minted shapes of slaughter fill the town. They curse the guards their mirth and bravery chose; All of them now are slain, or made like those. Far through an inward Scene an Army lay, Which with full banners a fair Fish display. From Sidon plains to happy Egypts coast 2 Sam. 5. 17. 18, 19, 20, 21, 22. 1 Chron. 14. 8. They seem all met; a vast and warlike Hoast. Thither hasts David to his destin'ed prey, Honor, and noble Danger lead the way; The conscious Trees shook with a reverent fear Ver. 22, 23. 24. Their unblown tops; God walkt before him there. 1 Chro. 14. 14. Slaughter the wearied Riphaims bosom fills, Dead corps imboss the vail with little hills. On th'other side Sophenes mighty King 2 Sam. 8. 3. 1 Chro. 18. 3. Ver. 5. 2 Sam. 10. 6. 1 Chron. 19. 6. &amp; 19. 8. Numberless troops of the blest East does bring: Twice are his men cut off, and chariots ta'ne; Damascus and rich Adad help in vaine. Here Nabathæan troops in battel stand, With all the lusty youth of Syrian land; Undaunted Joab rushes on with speed, Gallantly mounted on his fiery steed; He hews down all, and deals his deaths around; The Syrians leave, or possess dead the ground. On th' other wing does brave Abishai ride Ver. 10. Reeking in blood and dust; on every side The perjur'd sons of Ammon quit the field, Some basely dye, and some more basely yield. Through a thick wood the wretched Hanun flies, And far more justly then fears Hebrew Spies. Moloch, their bloody God, thrusts out his head, 2 Sam. 10. 3, 4. 1 Chro. 19. 3. Grinning through a black cloud; him they'd long fed In his sev'en Chambers, and he still did eat New-roasted babes, his dear, delicious meat. Again they'arise, more ang'red then dismaid; Ver. 15. 1 Chro. 19. 16. Euphrates, and Swift Tygris sends them aid: In vain they send it, for again they're slain, And feast the greedy birds on Helay plain. 2 Sam. 11. 1. 1 Chr. 20. Here Rabba with proud towers affronts the sky, And round about great Joabs trenches ly. They force the walls, and sack the helpless town; 2 Sam. 12. 30. 1 Chro. 20. 2. Ver. 31. 1 Chro. 20. 3. 1 King. 1. 1 Chron. 23. 1. 1 King. 3. 12. 2 Chro. 1. 12. 1 King. 10. Mat. 12. 42. Lu. 11. 31. On Davids head shines Ammons massy Crown. Midst various torments the curst race expires, David himself his severe wrath admires. Next upon Isra'els throne does bravely sit A comely Youth endow'ed with wondrous wit. Far from the parched Line a royal Dame, To hear his tongue and boundless wisdom came. She carried back in her triumphant womb The glorious stock of thousand Kings to come. Here brightest forms his pomp and wealth display, 2 Chro. 19. 1 King. 6. 2 Chro. 3. &amp; 4. 5. Here they a Temples vast foundations lay. A mighty work; and with fit glories fill'd. For God t'enhabit, and that King to build. Some from the quarries hew out massy stone, Some draw it up with cranes, some breathe and grone In order o're the anvile; some cut down Tall Cedars, the proud Mountains ancient crown; Some carve the Truncks, and breathing shapes bestow, Giving the Trees more life then when they grow; But, oh (alas) what sudden cloud is spread About this glorious Kings eclypsed head? 1 King. 11. It all his fame benights, and all his store, Wrapping him round, and now he's seen no more. When straight his Son appears at Sichem crown'd. 1 Kin. 12. 2 Chr. 10. With young and heedless Council circled round; Unseemly object! but a falling state Has always its own errours joyn'd with fate. Ten Tribes at once forsake the Jessian throne, And bold Adoram at his Message stone; Brethren of Israel!—more he fain would say, Ver. 18. 2 Chro. 10. 18. But a flint stopt his mouth, and speech i'th'way. Here this fond Kings disasters but begin, He's destin'ed to more shame by'his Fathers sin. Susack comes up, and under his command 1 Ki. 14. 25. 2 Chron. 12. 2. A dreadful Army from scorcht Africks sand As numberless as that; all is his prey, The Temples sacred wealth they bear away; Adrazars shields and golden loss they take; Ev'n David in his dream does sweat and shake. Thus fails this wretched Prince; his Loyns appear 1 Kin. 12. 10. 2 Chro. 10. 10. Of less weight now, then Solomons Fingers were. Abijah next seeks Isra'el to regain, 1 Ki. 15. 1. 2 Chro. 13. 1. &amp; 13. 3. And wash in seas of blood his Fathers stain; Ne're saw the aged Sun so cruel fight, Scarce saw he this, but hid his bashful light. Nebats curst son fled with not half his men, Where were his Gods of Dan and Bethel then? 2 Chron. 13. 17. Yet could not this the fatal strife decide; God punisht one, but blest not th'other side. Asan a just and vertuous Prince succeeds; High rais'd by fame for great and godly deeds; 2 Ki. 15. 9. 2 Chr. 14. 1. ver. 13. 2 Chro. 14. 3 He cut the solemn groves where Idols stood, And Sacrific'ed the Gods with their own wood. He vanquisht thus the proud weak powers of hell, Before him next their doating servants fell. So huge an Host of Zerahs men he slew, As made ev'en that Arabia Desert too. 2 Chr. 14. 9. 2 Chron. 16. 2. ver. 18. 2 Chron. 16. 8. Why fear'd he then the perjur'd Baasha's fight? Or bought the dangerous ayd of Syrian's might? Conquest Heav'ens gift, cannot by man be sold; Alas, what weakness trusts he? Man and Gold. Next Josaphat possest the royal state; 2 K. 15. 25. &amp; 22. 43. 2 Chr. 17. 2 Chron. 17. 11. An happy Prince, well worthy of his fate; His oft Oblations on Gods Altar made, With thousand flocks, and thousand herds are paid, Arabian Tribute! what mad troops are those, Those mighty Troops that dare to be his foes? He Prays them dead; with mutual wounds they fall; 2 Chro. 20. 17. One fury brought, one fury slays them all. Thus sits he still, and sees himself to win; 1 King. 22. 30. 2 Chro. 18. 19. Never o'recome but by's Friend Ahabs sin; On whose disguise fates then did onely look; And had almost their Gods command mistook. Him from whose danger heav'en securely brings, 2 King. 3. 14. &amp; 3. 9. &amp; 3. 8. And for his sake two ripely wicked Kings. Their Armies languish, burnt with thirst at Seere, Sighs all their Cold, Tears all their Moisture there. They fix their greedy eyes on th'empty sky, And fansie clouds, and so become more dry. Elisha calls for waters from afarre 2 Ki. 3. 13. To come; Elisha calls, and here they are. In helmets they quaff round the welcome flood; And the decrease repair with Moabs blood. 2 Ki. 3. 24. 2 Ki. 8. 16. &amp; 8. 25. 2 Chr. 21. 1. &amp; 22. 1. 2 Kin. 11. 1. 2 Chron. 22. 10. Jehoram next, and Ochoziah throng For Judahs Scepter; both short-liv'd too long. A Woman too from Murther Title claims; Both with her Sins and Sex the Crown she shames. Proud cursed Woman! but her fall at last To doubting men clears heav'en for what was past. Joas at first does bright and glorious show; 2 King. 12. 2 Chro. 24. In lifes fresh morn his fame did early crow. Fair was the promise of his dawning ray, But Prophets angry blood o'recast his day. From thence his clouds, from thence his storms begin, 2 Chro. 24. 21. 2 Ki. 12. 18. 2 Chro. 24. 23. 2 Kin. 14. 2 Chro. 25. It cryes aloud, and twice let's Aram in. So Amaziah lives, so ends his raign; Both by their Trayt'erous servants justly slain. Edom at first dreads his victorious hand, 2 Ki. 14. 7. 2 Chron. 25. 11. &amp; 25. 12. Before him thousand Captives trembling stand. Down a prec'ipice deep, down he casts them all, The mimick shapes in several postures fall. But then (mad fool!) he does those Gods adore, 2 Chron. 25. 14. 2 K. 14. 13. 2 Chron. 25. 23. Which when pluckt down, had worshipt him before. Thus all his life to come is loss and shame; No help from Gods who themselves helpt not, came. All this Uzziahs strength and wit repairs, 2 Ki. 15. 1. 2 Chr. 26. Leaving a well-built greatness to his Heirs. Till leprous scurff o're his whole body cast, 2 Ki. 15. 5. 2 Chr. 26. 19. Takes him at first from Men, from Earth at last. As vertuous was his Son, and happier far; 2 K. 15. 32. 2 Chr. 27. 2 Chr. 27. 4. Buildings his Peace, and Trophies grac'ed his War. But Achaz heaps up sins, as if he meant 2 Ki. 16. 1. 2 Chr. 28. 2 Ki. 16. 3. 2 Chr. 28. 3. To make his worst forefathers innocent. He burns his Son at Hinon, whilst around The roaring child drums and loud Trumpets sound. This to the boy a barb'arous mercy grew, And snatcht him from all mis'eries to ensue. Here Peca comes, and hundred thousands fall, 2 Ki. 16. 5. 2 Chro. 28. 6. Here Rezin marches up, and sweeps up all: Till like a Sea the Great Belochus Son 2 Ki. 16. 7. Breaks upon both, and both does over-run. The last of Adads ancient stock is slain, Isra'el captiv'ed, and rich Damascus ta'ne. 2 Ki. 16. 9. &amp; 15. 27. All this wild rage to revenge Juda's wrong; But wo to Kingdoms that have Friends too strong! 2 Chro. 28. 20. 2 Kin. 18. 2 Chr. 29. 2 Ki. 18. 7. Thus Hezechiah the torn Empire took, And Assurs King with his worse Gods forsook, Who to poor Juda worlds of Nations brings, There rages; utters vain and Mighty things, 2 King. 18. 17. 2 Chr. 32. Isa. 36. Some dream of triumphs, and exalted names, Some of dear gold, and some of beauteous dames; Whilst in the midst of their huge sleepy boast, 2 K. 19. 35. 2 Chron. 32. 21. 2 K. 19. 37. 2 Chr. 32. 21. An Angel scatters death through all the hoast. Th'affrighted Tyrant back to Babel hies, There meets an end far worse then that he flies. Here Hezekiahs life is almost done! So good, and yet, alas! so short 'tis spunne. Th'end of the Line was ravell'd, weak and old; Time must go back, and afford better hold 2 Kin. 20. 2 Chr. 32. 24. To tye a new thread to'it, of fifteen years; 'Tis done; Th'almighty power of prayer and tears! Backward the Sun, an unknown motion, went; 2 K. 20. 11. 2 Chr. 32. The Stars gaz'ed on, and wondred what he meant: Manasses next (forgetful man!) begins; 2 Kin. 21. 2 Chr. 33. Enslav'ed, and sold to Ashur by his sins. Till by the rod of learned mis'ery taught, Home to his God and Countrey both he's brought. It taught not Ammon, nor his hardness brake; 2 K. 21. 19. 2 Chro. 33. 21. 2 Kin. 22. 2 Kin. 23. He's made th'Example he refus'd to take. Yet from this root a goodly Cyon springs; Josiah best of Men, as well as Kings. Down went the Calves with all their gold and cost; The Preists then truly griev'ed, Osyris lost, These mad Egyptian rites till now remain'd; Fools! they their worser thraldome still retain'd! In his own Fires Moloch to ashes fell, 2 Kin. 23. 10. Ib. v. 13. And no more flames must have besides his Hell. Like end Astartes horned Image found, And Baals spired stone to dust was ground. No more were Men in female habit seen, Or They in Mens by the lewd Syrian Queen. No lustful Maids at Benos Temple sit, And with their bodies shame their marriage get. The double Dagon neither nature saves, Nor flies She back to th'Erythræan waves. The trav'elling Sun sees gladly from on high 2 King. 23 11. His Chariots burn, and Nergal quenched ly. The Kings impartial Anger lights on all, From fly-blown Acca'ron to the thundring Baâl. Here Davids joy unruly grows and bold; Nor could Sleeps silken chain its vio'lence hold; Had not the Angel to seal fast his eyes The humors stirr'd, and bad more mists arise: When straight a Chariot hurries swift away, And in it good Josiah bleeding lay. One hand's held up, one stops the wound; in vain They both are us'd; alas, he's slain, he's slain. Jehoias and Jehoikim next appear; 2 King. 23. 31. Ib. v. 26. 2 Chr. 36. 1. &amp; 5. 2 K. 23. 34. 2 Chro. 36. 4. Jer. 36. 30. 2 Ki. 24. 8. 2 Chro. 36. Both urge that vengeance which before was near. He in Egyptian fetters captive dies, Thus by more courteous anger murther'd lies. His Son and Brother next do bonds sustain, Isra'els now solemn and imperial Chain. Her'es the last Scene of this proud Cities state; All ills are met ty'ed in one knot of Fate. Their endless slavery in this tryal lay; Great God had heapt up Ages in one Day: Strong works around the wall the Caldees build, The Town with grief and dreadful bus'iness fill'd. 2 Kin. 25. 1. Jer. 52. 4. To their carv'ed Gods the frantick women pray, Gods which as near their ruine were as they. At last in rushes the prevailing foe, Does all the mischief of proud conquest show. The wondring babes from mothers breasts are rent, And suffer ills they neither fear'd nor meant. 2 Chr. 36. 17. No silver rev'erence guards the stooping age, No rule or method ties their boundless rage. The glorious Temple shines in flame all o're, 2 Chro. 36. 19. 2 King. 25. 9. Yet not so bright as in its Gold before. Nothing but fire or slaughter meets the eyes, Nothing the ear but groans and dismal cryes. The walls and towers are levi'ed with the ground, And scarce ought now of that vast Citie's found But shards and rubbish which weak signs might keep Of forepast glory, and bid Trav'ellers weep. Thus did triumphant Assur homewards pass, And thus Jerus'alem left, Jerusalem that was. Thus Zedechiah saw, and this not all; Before his face his Friends and Children fall, 2 Kin. 25. 7. Jer. 52. 10. The sport of ins'olent victors; this he viewes, A King and Father once; ill fate could use His eyes no more to do their master spight; All to be seen she took, and next his Sight. Thus a long death in prison he outwears; Bereft of griefs last solace, ev'en his Tears. Then Jeconiahs son did foremost come, Mat. 1. 12. Luk. 3. And he who brought the captiv'ed nation home; A row of Worthies in long order past O're the short stage; of all old Joseph last. Fair Angels past by next in seemly bands, All gilt, with gilded basquets in their hands. Some as they went the blew-ey'd violets strew, Some spotless Lilies in loose order threw. Some did the way with full-blown roses spread; Their smell divine and colour strangely red; Not such as our dull gardens proudly wear, Whom weathers taint, and winds rude kisses tear. Such, I believe, was the first Roses hew, Which at Gods word in beauteous Eden grew. Queen of the Flowers, which made that Orchard gay, The morning blushes of the Springs new Day. With sober pace an heav'enly Maid walks in, Her looks all fair; no sign of Native sin Through her whole body writ; Immod'erate Grace Spoke things far more then humane in her face. It casts a dusky gloom o're all the flow'rs; And with full beams their mingled Light devowrs. An Angel straight broke from a shining clowd, And prest his wings, and with much reve'rence bow'd. Again he bow'd, and grave approach he made, And thus his sacred Message sweetly said: Hail, full of Grace, thee the whole world shall call Lu. 1. 28. Above all blest; Thee, who shalt bless them all. Thy Virgin womb in wondrous sort shall shrowd Jesus the God; (and then again he bow'd) Conception the great Spirit shall breathe on thee; Hail thou, who must Gods wife, Gods mother be! With that, his seeming form to heav'n he rear'd; She low obeisance made, and disappear'd. Lo a new Star three eastern Sages see; (For why should onely Earth a Gainer be?) Mat. 2. 1. They saw this Phosphors infant-light, and knew It bravely usher'd in a Sun as New. They hasted all this rising Sun t'adore; With them rich myrrh, and early spices bore. Wise men; no fitter gift your zeal could bring; You'll in a noisome Stable find your King. Anon a thousand Dev'ils run roaring in; Some with a dreadful smile deform'edly grin. Some stamp their cloven paws, some frown and tear The gaping Snakes from their black-knotted hair. As if all grief, and all the rage of hell Were doubled now, or that just now they fell. But when the dreaded Maid they entring saw, All fled with trembling fear and silent aw. In her chast arms th' Eternal Infant lies, Th'Almighty voyce chang'ed into feeble cryes. Heav'en contain'd Virgins oft, and will do more; Never did Virgin contain Heav'en before. Angels peep round to view this mystick thing, And Halleluiah round, all Halleluiah sing. No longer could good David quiet bear, The unwieldy pleasure which ore-flow'd him here. It broke the fetters, and burst ope his ey. Away the tim'erous Forms together fly. Fixt with amaze he stood; and time must take, To learn if yet he were at last awake. Sometimes he thinks that heav'en this Vision sent, And order'ed all the Pageants as they went. Sometimes, that onely 'twas wild Phancies play, The loose and scatter'd reliques of the Day. When Gabriel (no blest Spirit more kind or fair) Bodies and cloathes himself with thickned ayr. All like a comely youth in lifes fresh bloom; Rare workmanship, and wrought by heavenly loom! He took for skin a cloud most soft and bright, That e're the midday Sun pierc'ed through with light: Upon his cheeks a lively blush he spred; Washt from the morning beauties deepest red. An harmless flaming Meteor shone for haire, And fell adown his shoulders with loose care. He cuts out a silk Mantle from the skies, Where the most sprightly azure pleas'd the eyes. This he with starry vapours spangles all, Took in their prime e're they grow ripe and fall. Of a new Rainbow e're it fret or fade, The choicest piece took out, a Scarf is made. Small streaming clouds he does for wings display, Not Vertuous Lovers sighes more soft then They. These he gilds o're with the Suns richest rays, Caught gliding o're pure streams on which he plays. Thus drest the joyful Gabriel posts away, And carries with him his own glorious day Through the thick woods; the gloomy shades a while Put on fresh looks, and wonder why they smile. The trembling Serpents close and silent ly, The birds obscene far from his passage fly. A sudden spring waits on him as he goes, Sudden as that by which Creation rose. Thus he appears to David, at first sight All earth-bred fears and sorrows take their flight. In rushes joy divine, and hope, and rest; A Sacred calm shines through his peaceful brest. Hail, Man belov'ed! from highest heav'en (said he) My mighty Master sends thee health by me. The things thou saw'est are full of truth and light, Shap'd in the glass of the divine Foresight. Ev'n now old Time is harnessing the years To go in order thus; hence empty fears; Thy Fate's all white; from thy blest seed shall spring The promis'd Shilo, the great Mystick King. Round the whole earth his dreaded name shall sound, And reach to Worlds, that must not yet be found. The Southern Clime him her sole Lord shall stile, Him all the North, ev'en Albions stubborn Isle. My Fellow-Servant, credit what I tell. Straight into shapeless air unseen he fell. DAVIDEIS. The third Book. THE CONTENTS. Davids flight to Nob, and entertainment there by the High Priest; from thence to Gath in disguise, where he is discovered and brought to Achis; He counterfeits himself Mad, and escapes to Adullam. A short enumeration of the forces which come thither to him. A description of the Kingdom of Moab, whither David flies; His entertainment at Moabs Court, a Digression of the History of Lot, Father of the Moabites, represented in Picture. Melchors Song at the Feast; Moab desires Joab to relate the story of David. Which he does; His Extraction, his excellency in Poesie, and the effects of it in curing Sauls malady. The Philistims Army encamped at Dammin, the Description of Goliah and his Arms, his Challenge to the Israelites, Davids coming to the Camp, his speech to Saul to desire leave to fight with Goliah; several speeches upon that occasion, the combat and slaughter of Goliah, with the defeat of the Philistims Army. Sauls envy to David. The Characters of Merab and Michol.

The Solemnities of the Wedding; Sauls relapse, and the causes of Davids flight into the Kingdom of Moab. Rais'd with the news he from high Heav'en receives, 1 Sam. 21. Straight to his diligent God just thanks he gives. To divine Nobe directs then his flight, A small Town great in Fame by Levy's right, Is there with sprightly wines, and hallowed bread, v. 4. 5. 6. Mat. 12. 4. (But what's to Hunger hallowed?) largely fed. The good old Priest welcomes his fatal Guest, And with long talk prolongs the hasty feast. He lends him vain Goliahs Sacred Sword, Ver. 9. (The fittest help just Fortune could afford) A Sword whose weight without a blow might slay, Able unblunted to cut Hosts away, A Sword so great, that i[t] was only fit To take off his great Head who came with it. Thus he arms David; I your own restore, Take it (said he) and use it as before. I saw you then, and 'twas the bravest sight That e're these Eyes ow'ed the discov'ering light. 1 Sam. 17. When you stept forth, how did the Monster rage, In scorn of your soft looks, and tender age! Some your high Spirit did mad Presumption call, Some piti'ed that such Youth should idly fall. Th'uncircumcis'ed smil'ed grimly with disdain; I knew the day was yours: I saw it plain. Much more the Reverend Sire prepar'ed to say, Rapt with his joy; how the two Armies lay; Which way th'amazed Foe did wildly flee, All that his Hearer better knew then He. But Davids hast denies all needless stay; To Gath an Enemies Land, he hastes away, 1 Sam. 21. 10. Not there secure, but where one Danger's near, The more remote though greater disappear. So from the Hawk, Birds to Mans succour flee, So from fir'ed Ships Man leaps into the Sea. There in disguise he hopes unknown t'abide! Alas! in vain! what can such greatness hide? Stones of small worth may lye unseen by Day, But Night it self does the rich Gem betray. Tagal first spi'ed him, a Philistian Knight, Who erst from Davids wrath by shameful flight Had sav'd the sordid remnant of his age; Hence the deep sore of Envy mixt with Rage. Straight with a band of Souldiers tall and rough, Trembling, for scarce he thought that band enough, On him he seises whom they all had fear'd, Had the bold Youth in his own shape appear'd. And now this wisht-for, but yet dreadful prey To Achis Court they led in hast away, With all unmanly rudeness which does wait Upon th'Immod'erate Vulgars Joy and Hate. His valour now and strength must useless ly, And he himself must arts unusu'al try; Sometimes he rends his garments, nor does spare The goodly curles of his rich yellow haire. 1 Sam. 21. 13. Sometimes a violent laughter scru'd his face, And sometimes ready tears dropt down apace. Sometimes he fixt his staring eyes on ground, And sometimes in wild manner hurl'd them round. More full revenge Philistians could not wish, But call't the Justice of their mighty Fish. They now in height of anger, let him Live; And Freedom too, t'encrease his scorn, they give. Ver. 15. He by wise Madness freed does homeward flee, And Rage makes them all that He seem'd to be. Near to Adullam in an aged Wood, 1 Sam. 22. 1. An Hill part earth, part rocky stone there stood, Hollow and vast within, which Nature wrought As if by 'her Scholar Art she had been taught. Hither young David with his Kindred came, Servants, and Friends; many his spreading fame, Many their wants or discontents did call; 1 Sam. 22. Great men in war, and almost Armies all! Hither came wise and valiant Joab down, One to whom Davids self must owe his Crown, A mighty man, had not some cunning Sin, Amidst so many Virtues crowded in. With him Abishai came by whom there fell 1 Chr. 11. 20. At once three hundred; with him Asahel: Asahel, swifter then the Northern wind; Scarce could the nimble Motions of his Mind Outgo his Feet; so strangely would he runne, That Time it self perceiv'ed not what was done. Oft o're the Lawns and Meadows would he pass, His weight unknown, and harmless to the grass; Oft o're the sands and hollow dust would trace, Yet no one Atome trouble or displace. Unhappy Youth, whose end so near I see! There's nought but thy Ill Fate so swift as Thee. Hither Jessides wrongs Benaiah drew, 1 Chro. 11. 22. He, who the vast exceeding Monster slew. Th'Egyptian like an Hill himself did rear, Like some tall Tree upon it seem'd his Spear. But by Benaiahs staff he fell orethrown; Vers. 23. The Earth, as if worst strook, did loudest groan. Such was Benaiah; in a narrow pit He saw a Lyon, and leapt down to it. Vers. 22. As eas'ily there the Royal Beast he tore As that it self did Kids or Lambs before. Him Ira follow'ed, a young lovely boy, But full of Sp'irit, and Arms was all his joy. 1 Chro. 11. 28. Oft when a child he in his dream would fight With the vain air, and his wak'ed Mother fright. Oft would he shoot young birds, and as they fall, Would laugh, and fansie them Philistians all. And now at home no longer would he stay, Though yet the face did scarce his Sex betray. Dodos great Son came next, whose dreadful hand Snatcht ripened Glories from a conque'ring band; 1 Chro. 11. 12. Who knows not Dammin, and that barley field, Which did a strange and bloody Harvest yield? Many besides did this new Troop encrease; Adan, whose wants made him unfit for peace. Eliel, whose full quiv'er did alwaies beare 1 Chro. 11. 46. As many Deaths as in it Arrows were. None from his hand did vain or inn'ocent flee, Scarce Love or Fate could aim so well as Hee. Many of Judah took wrong'ed Davids side, 1 Chr. 12. 16. And many of old Jacobs youngest Tribe; But his chief strength the Gathite Souldiers are, 1 Chro. 12. 8. Each single man able t'orecome a Warre! Swift as the Darts they fling through yielding air, And hardy all as the strong Steel they bare, A Lyons noble rage sits in their face, Terrible comely, arm'ed with dreadful grace! Th'undaunted Prince, though thus well guarded here, 1 Chr. 12. 8. Yet his stout Soul durst for his Parents fear; He seeks for them a safe and qui[et] seat, Nor trusts his Fortune with a Pledge so great. So when in hostile fire rich Asias pride For ten years siege had fully satisfi'ed, Æneas stole an act of higher Fame, Virg. 2. Æn. And bore Anchises through the wondring flame, A nobler Burden, and a richer Prey, Then all the Græcian forces bore away. Go pious Prince, in peace, in triumph go; Enjoy the Conquest of thine Overthrow; To have sav'd thy Troy would far less glorious be; By this thou Overcom'est their Victorie. Moab, next Judah, an old Kingdom, lies; Jordan their touch, and his curst Sea denies. They see North-stars from o're Amoreus ground, Edom and Petra their South part does bound. Eastwards the Lands of Cush and Ammon ly, The mornings happy beams they first espy. The region with fat soil and plenty's blest, A soil too good to be of old possest By monstrous Emins; but Lots off-spring came And conquer'ed both the People and the Name. Till Seon drave them beyond Arnons flood, And their sad bounds markt deep in their own blood. In Hesbon his triumphant Court he plac'ed, Hesbon by Men and Nature strangely grac'ed. A glorious Town, and fill'ed with all delight Which Peace could yield, though well prepar'ed for fight. But this proud City and her prouder Lord Num. 21. 24, 25. Felt the keen rage of Israels Sacred Sword, Whilst Moab triumpht in her torn estate, To see her own become her Conqu'erers fate. Yet that small remnant of Lots parted Crown Did arm'ed with Israels sins pluck Israel down, Full thrice six years they felt fierce Eglons yoke, Judg. 3. 14. Ib. v. 21. Till Ehuds sword Gods vengeful Message spoke; Since then their Kings in quiet held their owne, Quiet the good of a not envy'd Throne. And now a wise old Prince the Scepter sway'd, Well by his Subjects and Himself obey'd. Onely before his Fathers Gods he fell; Poor wretched Man, almost too good for Hell! Hither does David his blest Parents bring, With humble greatness begs of Moabs King, 1 Sam. 22. 3. A safe and fair abode, where they might live, Free from those storms with which himself must strive. The King with chearful grace his suit approv'd, By hate to Saul, and love to Virtue mov'd. Welcome great Knight, and your fair Troop (said he) Your Name found welcome long before with me. That to rich Ophirs rising Morn is knowne, And stretcht out far to the burnt swarthy Zone. Swift Fame, when her round journey she does make, Scorns not sometimes Us in her way to take. Are you the man, did that huge Gyant kill? Great Bâal of Phegor! and how young he's still! From Ruth we heard you came; Ruth was born here, Ru. 1. 4. In Judah sojourn'd, and (they say) matcht there Ru. 4. 10. To one of Bethlem; which I hope is true; Howe're your Virtues here entitle you. Those have the best alliance always bin, To Gods as well as Men they make us Kin. He spoke, and straight led in his thankful Guests, To'a stately Room prepar'ed for Shows and Feasts. The Room with golden Tap'estry glister'ed bright, At once to please and to confound the sight, Th' excellent work of Babylonian hands; In midst a Table of rich Iv'ory stands, By three fierce Tygers, and three Lyons born, Which grin, and fearfully the place adorn. Widely they gape, and to the eye they roare, As if they hunger'd for the food they bore. About it Beds of Lybian Citron stood, With coverings dy'ed in Tyrian Fishes blood, They say, th'Herculean art; but most delight Some Pictures gave to Davids learned sight. Here several ways Lot and great Abram go, Gen. 13. 6. Their too much wealth, vast, and unkind does grow. Thus each extream to equal danger tends, Plenty as well as Want can separate Friends; Here Sodoms Towers raise their proud tops on high; The Towers as well as Men outbrave the sky. By it the waves of rev'erend Jordan run, Here green with Trees, there gilded with the Sun. Hither Lots Houshould comes, a numerous train, And all with various business fill the plain. Ib. v. 10. Some drive the crowding sheep with rural hooks, They lift up their mild heads, and bleat in looks. Some drive the Herds; here a fierce Bullock scorns Th'appointed way, and runs with threatning horns; In vain the Herdman calls him back again; The Dogs stand off afar, and bark in vain. Some lead the groaning waggons, loaded high, With stuff, on top of which the Maidens ly. Upon tall Camels the fair Sisters ride, And Lot talks with them both on either side. Another Picture to curst Sodom brings Gen. 14. 11, 12. Elams proud Lord, with his three servant Kings: They sack the Town, and bear Lot bound away; Ib. v. 10. Whilst in a Pit the vanquisht Bera lay, Buried almost alive for fear of Death. But heav'ens just vengeance sav'ed as yet his breath. Abraham pursues, and slays the Victors Hoast, Gen. 14. 13. Scarce had their Conquest leisure for a boast. Next this was drawn the reckless Cities flame, Gen. 19. 24. When a strange Hell pour'd down from Heaven there came. Here the two Angels from Lots window look With smiling anger; the lewd wretches, strook Ib. v. 11. With sudden blindness, seek in vain the dore, Their Eyes, first cause of Lust, first Veng'eance bore. Through liquid Air, heav'ns busie Souldiers fly, And drive on Clouds where seeds of Thunder ly. Here the sad sky gloes red with dismal streaks, Here Lightning from it with short trembling breaks. Here the blew flames of scalding brimstone fall, Involving swiftly in one ruine all. The fire of Trees and Houses mounts on high, And meets half way new fires that showre from sky. Some in their arms snatch their dear babes away; At once drop down the Fathers arms, and They. Some into waters leap with kindled hair, And more to vex their fate, are burnt ev'en there. Men thought, so much a Flame by Art was shown, The Pictures self would fall in ashes down. Afar old Lot to'ward little Zoar hyes, And dares not move (good man) his weeping eyes. Gen. 19. 17. Ib. v. 26. Behind his Wife stood ever fixt alone; No more a Woman, not yet quite a Stone. A lasting Death seiz'd on her turning head; One cheek was rough and white, the other red, And yet a Cheek; in vain to speak she strove; Her lips, though stone, a little seem'd to move. One eye was clos'ed, surpris'ed by sudden night, The other trembled still with parting light. The wind admir'ed which her hair loosely bore, Why it grew stiff, and now would play no more. To heav'en she lifted up her freezing hands, And to this day a Suppliant Pillar stands. She try'ed her heavy foot from ground to rear, And rais'd the Heel, but her Toe's rooted there: Ah foolish woman! who must always be, A sight more strange then that she turn'd to see! Whilst David fed with these his curious eye, The Feast is now serv'ed in, and down they lye. Moab a goblet takes of massy gold, Which Zippor, and from Zippor all of old Quaft to their Gods and Friends; an Health goes round In the brisk grape of Arnons richest ground. Whilst Melchor to his harp with wondrous skill (For such were Poets then, and should be still) His noble verse through Natures secrets lead; He sung what Spirit, through the whole Mass is spread, Ev'ery where All; how Heavens Gods Law approve, And think it Rest eternally to Move. How the kind Sun usefully comes and goes, Wants it himself, yet gives to Man repose. How his round Journey does for ever last, And how he baits at every Sea in haste. He sung how Earth blots the Moons gilded Wane, Whilst foolish men beat sounding Brass in vain, Why the Great Waters her slight Horns obey, Her changing Horns, not constanter than They; He sung how grisly Comets hang in ayr, Why Sword and Plagues attend their fatal hair. Gods Beacons for the world, drawn up so far, To publish ills, and raise all earth to war. Why Contraries feed Thunder in the cloud, What Motions vex it, till it roar so loud. How Lambent Fires become so wondrous tame, And bear such shining Winter in their Flame. What radiant Pencil draws the Watry Bow: What tyes up Hail, and picks the fleecy Snow. What Palsie of the Earth here shakes fixt Hills, From off her brows, and here whole Rivers spills. Thus did this Heathen Natures Secrets tell, And sometimes mist the Cause, but sought it Well. Such was the sawce of Moabs noble feast, Till night far spent invites them to their rest. Only the good old Prince stays Joab there, And much he tells, and much desires to hear. He tells deeds antique, and the new desires; Of David much, and much of Saul enquires. Nay gentle Guest (said he) since now you're in, The story of your gallant friend begin. His birth, his rising tell, and various fate, And how he slew that man of Gath of late, What was he call'd? that huge and monstrous man? With that he stopt, and Joab thus began: His birth, great Sir, so much to mine is ty'd, 1 Chr. 2. 16. That praise of that might look from me like pride. Yet without boast, his veins contain a flood Of the old Judæan Lyons richest blood. Gen. 49. 9. 1 Chr. 2. Mat. 1. From Judah Pharez, from him Esrom came Ram, Nashon, Salmon, Names spoke loud by Fame. A Name no less ought Boaz to appear, By whose blest match we come no strangers here. From him and your fair Ruth good Obed sprung, From Obed Jesse, Jesse whom fames kindest tongue, Counting his birth, and high nobil'ity, shall Not Jesse of Obed, but of David call, David born to him sev'enth; the six births past 1 Chr. 2. 15. 1 Sam. 16. Brave Tryals of a work more great at last. Bless me! how swift and growing was his wit? The wings of Time flag'd dully after it. Scarce past a Child, all wonders would he sing Of Natures Law, and Pow'er of Natures King. His sheep would scorn their food to hear his lay, And savage Beasts stand by as tame as they. The fighting Winds would stop there, and admire; Learning Consent and Concord from his Lyre. Rivers, whose waves roll'd down aloud before; Mute, as their Fish, would listen to'wards the shore. 'Twas now the time when first Saul God forsook, 1 Sam. 16. 14. God Saul; the room in's heart wild Passions took; Sometimes a Tyrant-Frensie revell'd there, Sometimes black sadness, and deep, deep despair. No help from herbs or learned drugs he finds, They cure but sometime Bodies, never Minds. Musick alone those storms of Soul could lay; Not more Saul them, then Musick they obey. 1 Sam. 16. 23. Davia's now sent for, and his Harp must bring; His Harp that Magick bore on ev'ery string. When Sauls rude passions did most tumult keep; With his soft notes they all dropt down asleep. When his dull Spir'its lay drown'd in Death and Night; He with quick strains rais'd them to Life and Light. Thus chear'd he Saul, thus did his fury swage, Till wars began, and times more fit for rage. To Helah Plain Philistian Troops are come, 1 Sam. 17. And Wars loud noise strikes peaceful Musick dumb. Back to his rural Care young David goes, For this rough work Saul his stout Brethren chose. He knew not what his hand in War could do, Nor thought his Sword could cure mens Madness too. Now Dammin's destin'ed for this Scene of Blood, On two near Hills the two proud Armies stood. Between a fatal Valley stretcht out wide, And Death seem'd ready now on either side, When (Lo!) their Host rais'd all a joyful shout, And from the midst an huge &amp; monstrous man stept out. 1 Sam. 17. 4. Aloud they shouted at each step he took; We and the Earth it self beneath him shook, Vast as the Hill, down which he marcht, he'appear'd; Amaz'ed all Eyes, nor was their Army fear'd. A young tall Squire (though then he seem'd not so) Did from the Camp at first before him go; At first he did, but scarce could follow strait, Sweating beneath a Shields unruly weight, On which was wrought the Gods, and Gyants fight, Rare work! all fill'd with terrour and delight. Here a vast Hill, 'gainst thundring Baal was thrown, Trees and Beasts on't fell burnt with Lightning down. One flings a Mountain, and its River too Torn up with't; that rains back on him that threw. Some from the Main to pluck whole Islands try; The Sea boils round with flames shot thick from sky. This he believ'd, and on his shield he bore, And prais'd their strength, but thought his own was more. The Valley now this Monster seem'd to fill; And we (methoughts) lookt up to'him from our Hill. All arm'd in Brass, the richest dress of War (A dismal glorious sight) he shone afar. The Sun himself started with sudden fright, To see his beams return so dismal bright. Brass was his Helmet, his Boots brass; and o're 1 Sam. 17. 7, &amp;c. His breast a thick plate of strong brass he wore, His Spear the Trunk was of a lofty Tree, Which Nature meant some tall ships Mast should be, The'huge I'ron head six hundred shekels weigh'd, And of whole bodies but one wound it made, Able Deaths worst command to overdo, Destroying Life at once and Carcase too; Thus arm'd he stood; all direful, and all gay, And round him flung a scornful look away. So when a Scythian Tyger gazing round, An Herd of Kine in some fair Plain has found Lowing secure, he swells with angry pride, And calls forth all his spots on ev'ery side. Then stops, and hurls his haughty eyes at all, In choise of some strong neck on which to fall. Almost he scorns, so weak, so cheap a prey, And grieves to see them trembling hast away. Ye men of Jury, 'he cries, if Men you be, Ib. v. 8. And such dare prove your selves to Fame and Me, Chuse out 'mongst all your Troops the boldest Knight, To try his strength and fate with me in fight. The chance of War let us two bear for all, And they the Conqu'eror serve whose Knight shall fall. Ib. v. 9. 10. At this he paws'd a while; straight, I defie Your Gods and You; dares none come down and dy? Go back for shame, and Egypts slav'ery bear, Or yield to us, and serve more nobly here. Alas ye'have no more Wonders to be done, Your Sorc'erer Moses now and Josua's gone, Your Magick Trumpets then could Cities take, Jos. 6. 20. And sounds of Triumph did your Battels make. Spears in your hands and manly Swords are vain; Get you your Spells, and Conjuring Rods again. Is there no Sampson here? Oh that there were! In his full strength, and long Enchanted Hair. Judg. 16. 17. This Sword should be in the weak Razors stead; It should not cut his Hair off, but his Head. Thus he blasphem'd aloud; the Valleys round Flatt'ering his voice restor'd the dreadful sound. We turn'd us trembling at the noise, and fear'd We had behind some new Goliah heard. 'Twas Heav'en, Heav'en sure (which Davids glory meant 1 Sam. 17. 11. Through this whole Act) such sacred terrour sent To all our Host, for there was Saul in place, Who ne're saw fear but in his Enemies face, His god-like Son there in bright Armour shone, Who scorn'd to conquer Armies not Alone. 1 Sam. 14. Fate her own Book mistrusted at the sight; On that side War, on this a Single Fight. There stood Benaiah, and there trembled too, He who th' Egyptian, proud Goliah slew. In his pale fright, rage through his eyes shot flame, 1 Chr. 11. He saw his staff, and blusht with generous shame. Thousands beside stood mute and heartless there, Men valiant all; nor was I us'ed to Fear. Thus forty days he marcht down arm'd to fight, Once every morn he marcht, and once at night. Slow rose the Sun, but gallopt down apace, With more than Evening blushes in his face. When Jessey to the Camp young David sent; His purpose low, but high was Fates intent. 1 Sam. 17. 12, &amp;c. For when the Monsters pride he saw and heard, Round him he look'd, and wonder'd why they fear'd. Anger and brave disdain his heart possest, Thoughts more than manly swell'd his youthful brest. Much the rewards propos'd his spirit enflame, 1 Sam. 17. 25. Sauls Daughter much, and much the voice of Fame. These to their just intentions strongly move, But chiefly God, and his dear Countrys Love, Resolv'd for combat to Sauls Tent he's brought, Where thus he spoke, as boldly as he fought: Henceforth no more, great Prince, your sacred brest Ib. v. 32. With that huge talking wretch of Gath molest. This hand alone shall end his cursed breath; Fear not, the wretch blasphemes himself to death, And cheated with false weight of his own might, Has challeng'd Heaven, not Us, to single fight. Forbid it God, that where thy right is try'd, The strength of man should find just cause for pride! Firm like some Rock, and vast he seems to stand, But Rocks we know were op'ed at thy command. Exod. 17. 6. That Soul which now does such large members sway, Through one small wound will creep in hast away. And he who now dares boldly Heav'en defie, To ev'ery bird of Heav'en a prey shall lie. For 'tis not humane force we ought to fear; Did that, alas, plant our Forefathers here? Twice fifteen Kings did they by that subdue? Josh. 12. By that whole Nations of Goliahs slew? The wonders they perform'd may still be done; Moses and Josua is, but God's not gone. We'have lost their Rod and Trumpets, not their skill: Pray'rs and Belief are as strong Witchcraft still. These are more tall, more Gyants far then He, Can reach to Heav'en, and thence pluck Victorie. Count this, and then, Sir, mine th'advantage is; He's stronger far then I, my God then His. Amazement seiz'd on all, and shame to see, Their own fears scorn'd by one so young as He. Brave Youth (replies the King) whose daring mind 1 Sam. 17. 33. Ere come to Manhood, leaves it quite behind; Reserve thy valour for more equal fight, And let thy Body grow up to thy Spright. Thou'rt yet too tender for so rude a foe, Whose touch would wound thee more then him thy blow. Nature his Limbs onely for war made fit, In thine as yet nought beside Love she'has writ. With some less Foe thy unflesht valour try; This Monster can be no first Victory. The Lyons royal whelp does not at first For blood of Basan Bulls or Tygers thirst. In timorous Deer he hansels his young paws, And leaves the rugged Bear for firmer claws. So vast thy hopes, so unproportion'd bee, Fortune would be asham'ed to second Thee. He said, and we all murmur'd an assent; But nought moves David from his high intent. It brave to him, and om'inous does appear, To be oppos'ed at first, and conquer here, Which he resolves; Scorn not (said he) mine age, For Vict'ory comes not like an Heritage, 1 Sam. 37. 33. At set-years; when my Fathers flock I fed, A Bear and Lyon by fierce hunger led, Broke from the wood, and snatcht my Lambs away; From their grim mouths I forc'ed the panting prey. Both Bear and Lyon ev'en this hand did kill, On our great Oak the Bones and Jaws hang still. My God's the same, which then he was, to day, And this wild wretch almost the same as They. Who from such danger sav'ed my Flock, will he Of Isra'el, his own Flock less careful be? Be't so then (Saul bursts forth:) and thou on high, Who oft in weakness do'st most strength descry, At whose dread beck Conquest expecting stands, And casts no look down on the Fighters hands, Assist what Thou inspir'est; and let all see, As Boys to Gyants, Gyants are to Thee. Thus; and with trembling hopes of strange success, In his own arms he the bold Youth does dress. 1 Sam. 17. 34. On's head an helm of well-wrought brass is place'd, The top with warlike Plume severely grace'd. His breast a plate cut with rare Figures bore, A Sword much practis'ed in Deaths art he wore. Yet David use'd so long to no defence, But those light Arms of Spirit and Innocence, No good in fight of that gay burden knows, But fears his own arms weight more then his Foes. He lost himself in that disguise of warre, And guarded seems as men by Prisons are. He therefore to exalt the wondrous sight, Prepares now, and disarms himself for fight. 'Gainst Shield, Helm, Breast-plate, and instead of those 1 Sam. 17. 40. Five sharp smooth stones from the next brook he chose, And fits them to his sling; then marches down; For Sword, his Enemies he esteem'd his Own. We all with various passion strangely gaz'ed, Some sad, some 'sham'd, some angry, all amaz'ed. Now in the Valley'he stands; through's youthful face Wrath checks the Beauty, and sheds manly grace. Both in his looks so joyn'd, that they might move Fear ev'n in Friends, and from an En'emy Love. Hot as ripe Noon, sweet as the blooming Day, Like July furious, but more fair than May. Th'accurst Philistian stands on th'other side, Ib. v. 45. Grumbling aloud, and smiles 'twixt rage and pride. The Plagues of Dagon! a smooth Boy, said he, A cursed beardless foe oppos'd to Me! Hell! with what arms (hence thou fond Child) he's come! Some friend his Mother call to drive him home. Not gone yet? if one minute more thou stay, The birds of heav'en shall bear thee dead away. Gods! a curst Boy! the rest then murmuring out, He walks, and casts a deadly grin about. David with chearful anger in his Eyes, Advances boldly on, and thus replies, Thou com'est, vain Man, all arm'ed into the field, Ib. v. 45. And trustest those War toys, thy Sword, and Shield; Thy Pride's my Spear, thy Blasphemies my Sword; My Shield, thy Maker, Fool; the mighty Lord Of Thee and Battels; who hath sent forth me Unarm'ed thus, not to Fight, but Conquer thee. In vain shall Dagon thy false Hope withstand; In vain thy other God, thine own right hand. Thy fall to man shall heavens strong justice shew; Wretch! 'tis the only Good which thou canst do. He said; our Hoast stood dully silent by; And durst not trust their Ears against the Eye. As much their Champions threats to him they fear'd, As when the Monsters threats to them they heard, His flaming Sword th'enrag'd Philistian shakes, And hast to'his ruine with loud Curses makes. Backward the Winds his active Curses blew, And fatally round his own head they flew. For now from Davids sling the stone is fled, Ib. v. 49. And strikes with joyful noise the Monsters head. It strook his forehead, and pierc'ed deeply there; As swiftly as it pierc'ed before the Ayre. Down, down he falls, and bites in vain the ground; Blood, Brain, and Soul crowd mingled through the Wound. So a strong Oak, which many years had stood With fair and flourishing boughs, it self a Wood; Though it might long the Axes violence bear, And play'd with Winds which other Trees did tear; Yet by the Thunders stroke from th'root 'tis rent; So sure the blows that from high heav'en are sent. What tongue the joy and wonder can express, Which did that moment our whole Host possess? Their jocond shouts th'air like a storm did tear, Th'amazed Clouds fled swift away with Fear. But far more swift th'accurs'd Philistians fly, 1 Sam. 17. 52. And their ill fate to perfect, basely dye. With thousand corps the ways around are strown, Till they, by the days flight secure their own. Now through the Camp sounds nought but Davids name; All joys of several stamp and colours came From several passions; some his Valour praise, Some his free Speech, some the fair pop'ular rayes Of Youth, and Beauty, and his modest Guise; Gifts that mov'd all, but charm'ed the Female Eyes. Some wonder, some they thought t'would be so swear; And some saw Angels flying through the air. The basest spi'rits cast back a crooked glance On this great act, and fain would give't to Chance. Women our Host with Songs and Dances meet, 1 Sam. 18. With much joy Saul, David with more they greet. Hence the Kings politique rage and envy flows, Ib. v. 8. Which first he hides, and seeks his life t'expose To gen'erous dangers that his hate might clear, And Fate or Chance the blame, nay David bear. So vain are mans designs! for Fate, and Chance, And Earth, and Heav'en conspir'ed to his advance; His Beauty, Youth, Courage and wondrous Wit, In all Mankind but Saul did Love begit. 1 Sam. 18. 16. Not Sauls own house, not his own nearest blood, The noble causes sacred force withstood. You'have met no doubt, and kindly us'ed the fame, Of God-like Jonathans illustrious Name; A Name which ev'ery wind to heav'en would bear, Which Men to speak, and Angels joy to hear. No Angel e're bore to his Brother-Mind A kindness more exalted and refin'd, Then his to David, which look'd nobly down, And scorn'd the false Alarums of a Crown. At Dammin field he stood; and from his place 1 Sam. 18. Leapt forth, the wondrous Conqu'eror to embrace; On him his Mantle, Girdle, Sword, and Bow, Ib. v. 4. On him his Heart and Soul he did bestow. Not all that Saul could threaten or perswade, In this close knot the smallest looseness made. Oft his wise care did the Kings rage suspend. His own lifes danger shelter'd oft his Friend 1 Sam. 20. 33. His own lifes danger shelter'd oft his Friend Which he expos'ed a Sacrifice to fall By th'undiscerning rage of furious Saul. Nor was young Davids active vertue grown Strong and triumphant in one Sex alone. Imperious Beauty too it durst invade, And deeper Prints in the soft breast it made, 1 Sam. 18. 20. 28. For there t' esteem and Friendships graver name, Passion was pour'd like Oyl into the Flame. Like two bright Eyes in a fair Body plac'ed, Sauls Royal house two beauteous Daughters grac'ed. Merab the first, Michol the younger nam'ed, Both equally for different glories fam'ed. Merab with spatious beauty fill'ed the sight, But too much aw chastis'ed the bold delight. Like a calm Sea, which to th'enlarged view, Gives pleasure, but gives fear and rev'erence too. Michols sweet looks clear and free joys did move, And no less strong, though much more gentle Love. Like virtuous Kings whom men rejoyce t'obey, Tyrants themselves less absolute then They. Merab appear'd like some fair Princely Tower, Michol some Virgin Queens delicious Bower. All Beauties stores in Little and in Great; But the contracted Beams shot fiercest heat. A clean and lively Brown was Merabs dy, Such as the Prouder colours might envy. Michols pure skin shone with such taintless White, As scatter'd the weak rays of humane sight. Her lips and cheeks a nobler red did shew, Then e're on fruits or flowers Heav'ens Pencil drew. From Merabs eyes fierce and quick Lightnings came, From Michols the Suns mild, yet active flame; Merabs long hair was glossy chestnut brown, Tresses of palest gold did Michol crown. Such was their outward form, and one might find A difference not unlike it in the Mind. Merab with comely Majesty and state Bore high th'advantage of her Worth and Fate. Such humble sweetness did soft Michol show, That none who reach so high e're stoopt so low. Merab rejoyc'd in her wrackt Lovers pain, And fortifi'd her vertue with Disdain. The griefs she caus'd gave gentle Michol grief, She wisht her Beauties less for their relief, Ev'en to her Captives civil; yet th'excess Of naked Virtue guarded her no less. Business and Power Merabs large thoughts did vex, Her wit disdain'd the Fetters of her Sex. Michol no less disdain'd affairs and noise, Yet did it not from Ignorance, but Choise. In brief, both Copies were most sweetly drawn; Merab of Saul, Michol of Jonathan. The day that David great Goliah slew, Not great Goliahs Sword was more his due, Then Merab; by Sauls publick promise she Was sold then and betroth'd to Victory. But haughty she did this just match despise, Her Pride debaucht her Judgment and her Eyes. An unknown Youth, ne're seen at Court before, Who Shepherds-staff, and Shepherds habit bore; The seventh-born Son of no rich house, were still Th'unpleasant forms which her high thoughts did fill. And much aversion in her stubborn mind Was bred by being promis'd and design'd. Long had the patient Adriel humbly born The roughest shocks of her imperious scorn, Adriel the Rich, but riches were in vain, And could nor set him free, nor her enchain. Long liv'ed they thus; but as the hunted Dear Closely pursu'ed quits all her wonted fear, And takes the nearest waves, which from the shore She oft with horrour had beheld before. So whilst the violent Maid from David fled, She leapt to Adriels long avoided bed. 1 Sam. 18. 19. The match was nam'd, agreed, and finisht strait; So soon comply'd Sauls Envy with her Hate. But Michol in whose breast all virtues move That hatch the pregnant seeds of sacred Love, With juster eyes the noble Object meets, And turns all Merabs Poyson into Sweets. She saw and wondred how a Youth unknown, Should make all Fame to come so soon his own: She saw, and wondred how a Shepherds Crook Despis'd that Sword at which the Scepter shook. Though he seventh-born, &amp; though his House but poor, She knew it noble was, and would be more. Oft had she heard, and fansied oft the sight, With what a generous calm he marcht to fight. In the great danger how exempt from Fear, And after it from Pride he did appear. Greatness, and Goodness, and an Ayr divine, She saw through all his words and actions shine. She heard his eloquent Tongue, and charming Lyre, Whose artful sounds did violent Love inspire, Though us'd all other Passions to relieve; She weigh'd all this, and well we may conceive, When those strong thoughts attaqu'd her doubtful brest, His Beauty no less active than the rest. The Fire thus kindled soon grew fierce and great, When Davids brest reflected back its heat. Soon she perceiv'd (scarce can Love hidden ly From any sight, much less the Loving Eye) She Conqu'eror was as well as Overcome, And gain'd no less Abroad than lost at Home. Even the first hour they met (for such a pair, Who in all mankind else so matchless were, Yet their own Equals, Natures self does wed) A mutual warmth through both their bosoms spred. Fate gave the Signal; both at once began The gentle Race, and with just pace they ran. Ev'en so (methinks) when two Fair Tapers come, From several Doors entring at once the Room, With a swift flight that leaves the Eye behind; Their amorous Lights into one Light are join'd. Nature herself, were she to judge the case, Knew not which first began the kind embrace. Michol her modest flames sought to conceal, But Love ev'en th' Art to hide it does reveal. Her soft unpractis'd Eyes betray'd the Theft, Love past through them, and there such footsteps left. She blusht when he approacht, and when he spoke, And suddenly her wandring answers broke, At his names sound, and when she heard him prais'd, With concern'd haste her thoughtful looks she rais'd. Uncall'd for sighs oft from her bosome flew, And Adriels active friend she'abruptly grew. Oft when the Courts gay youth stood waiting by, She strove to act a cold Indifferency; In vain she acted so constrain'd a part, For thousand Nameless things disclos'd her Heart. On th'other side David with silent pain Did in respectful bounds his Fires contain. His humble fear t'offend, and trembling aw, Impos'd on him a no less rigorous Law Then Modesty on her, and though he strove To make her see't, he durst not tell his Love. To tell it first the timorous youth made choice Of Musicks bolder and more active voice. And thus beneath her Window, did he touch His faithful Lyre; the words and numbers such, As did well worth my Memory appear, And may perhaps deserve your princely Ear. 1 Awake, awake my Lyre, And tell thy silent Masters humble tale, In sounds that may prevail; Sounds that gentle thoughts inspire, Though so Exalted she And I so Lowly be, Tell her such diffe'rent Notes make all thy Harmonie. 2 Hark, how the Strings awake, And though the Moving Hand approach not near, Themselves with awful fear, A kind of num'erous Trembling make. Now all thy Forces try, Now all thy charms apply, Revenge upon her Ear the Conquests of her Eye. 3 Weak Lyre! thy vertue sure Is useless here, since thou art only found To Cure, but not to Wound, And she to Wound, but not to Cure. Too weak too wilt thou prove My Passion to remove, Physick to other Ills, thou'rt Nourishment to Love. 4 Sleep, sleep again, my Lyre; For thou can'st never tell my humble tale, In sounds that will prevail, Nor gentle thoughts in her inspire; All thy vain mirth lay by, Bid thy strings silent ly, Sleeep, sleep again, my Lyre, and let thy Master dy. She heard all this, and the prevailing sound Toucht with delightful pain her tender wound. Yet though she joy'd th' authentique news to hear, Of what she guest before with jealous fear, She checkt her forward joy, and blusht for shame, And did his boldness with forc'ed anger blame. The senseless rules, which first False Honour taught, And into Laws the Tyrant Custom brought, Which Womens Pride and Folly did invent, Their Lovers and Themselves too to torment, Made her next day a grave displeasure fain, And all her words, and all her looks constrain Before the trembling youth; who when he saw His vital Light her wonted beams withdraw, He curst his voice, his fingers, and his Lyre, He curst his too bold Tongue, and bold Desire. In vain he curst the last, for that still grew; From all things Food its strong Complexion drew: His Joy and Hope their chearful motions ceast, His Life decay'd, but still his Love encreast. Whilst she whose Heart approv'd not her Disdain, Saw and endur'd his pains with greater pain. But Jonathan, to whom both hearts were known With a concernment equal to their own, Joyful that Heav'en with his sworn love comply'd To draw that knot more fast which he had ty'd, With well-tim'd zeal, and with an artful care, Restor'd, and better'd soon the nice affair. With ease a Brothers lawful power o'recame The formal decencies of virgin-shame. She first with all her heart forgave the past, Heard David tell his flames, and told her own at last. Lo here the happy point of prosperous Love! Which ev'en Enjoyment seldom can improve! Themselves agreed, which scarce could fail alone, All Israels wish concurrent with their own. A Brothers powerful ayd firm to the side, By solemn vow the King and Father tyde: All jealous fears, all nice disguises past, All that in less-ripe Love offends the Tast, In eithers Breast their Souls both meet and wed, Their Heart the Nuptial-Temple and the Bed. And though the grosser cates were yet not drest, By which the Bodies must supply this Feast; Bold Hopes prevent slow Pleasures lingring birth, As Saints assur'd of Heav'en enjoy't on Earth. All this the King observ'd, and well he saw What scandal, and what danger it might draw T'oppose this just and pop'ular match, but meant T' out-malice all Refusals by Consent. He meant the pois'onous grant should mortal prove, He meant t'ensnare his Virtue by his Love. 1 Sam. 18. 21. And thus he to him spoke, with more of art And fraud, then well became the Kingly part. Your valour, David, and high worth (said he) To praise, is all mens duty, mine to see Rewarded; and we shall t'our utmost powers Do with like care that part, as you did yours. Forbid it God, we like those Kings should prove, Who Fear the Vertues which they're bound to Love. Your Pi'ety does that tender point secure, Nor will my Acts such humble thoughts endure. Your neerness to't rather supports the Crown, And th'honours giv'en to you encrease our own. All that we can we'll give; 'tis our intent Both as a Guard, and as an Ornament To place thee next our selves; Heav'en does approve, And my Sons Friendship, and my Daughters Love, Guide fatally, methinks, my willing choice; I see, methinks, Heav'en in't, and I rejoice. Blush not, my Son, that Michols Love I name, Nor need she blush to hear it; 'tis no shame Nor secret now; Fame does it loudly tell, And all men but thy Rivals like it well. If Merabs choice could have comply'd with mine, Merab, my elder comfort, had been thine. And hers at last should have with mine comply'd, Had I not Thine and Michols heart descry'd. Take whom thou lov'est, and who loves thee; the last And dearest Present made me by the chast Ahinoam; and unless she me deceive, When I to Jonathan my Crown shall leave, 'Twill be a smaller Gift. If I thy generous thoughts may undertake To guess, they are what Jointure thou shalt make, Fitting her birth and fortune: and since so Custom ordains, we mean t'exact it too. The Joynture we exact, is that shall be No less advantage to thy Fame than She. Go where Philistian Troops infest the Land; Renew the terrours of thy conquering hand. When thine own hand, which needs must conqu'ror prove, In this joint cause of Honour and of Love, An hundred of the faithless Foe shall slay, And for a Dowre their hundred foreskins pay, 1 Sam. 18. 25. Be Michol thy Reward; did we not know Thy mighty Fate, and Worth that makes it so, We should not cheaply that dear blood expose Which we to mingle with our own had chose. But thou'rt secure; and since this match of thine We to the publick benefit design, A publick good shall its beginning grace, And give triumphant Omens of thy race. Thus spoke the King: the happy Youth bow'd low; Modest and graceful his great joy did show, The noble task well pleas'd his generous mind; And nought t' except against it could he find, But that his Mistress price too cheap appear'd, No Danger, but her Scorn of it he fear'd. She with much different sense the news receiv'd, At her high rate she trembled, blusht, and griev'd. 'Twas a less work the conquest of his Foes, Than to obtain her leave his life t'expose. Their kind debate on this soft point would prove Tedious, and needless to repeat: If Love (As sure it has) e're toucht your princely brest, 'Twill to your gentle thoughts at full suggest All that was done, or said; the grief, hope, fears; His troubled joys, and her obliging Tears. In all the pomp of Passions reign, they part; And bright prophetique forms enlarge his heart; Vict'ory and Fame; and that more quick delight Of the rich prize for which he was to fight. Tow'ards Gath he went; and in one month (so soon A fatal, and a willing work is done) A double Dowre, two hundred foreskins brought Of choice Philistian Knights with whom he fought, Men that in birth and valour did excel, Fit for the Cause and Hand by which they fell. Now was Saul caught; nor longer could delay The two resistless Lovers happy day. Though this days coming long had seem'd and slow, Yet seem'd its stay as long and tedious now. For now the violent weight of eager Love, Did with more haste so near its Centre move, He curst the stops of form and state, which lay In this last stage like Scandals in his way. On a large gentle Hill, crown'd with tall wood, Neer where the regal Gabaah proudly stood, A Tent was pitcht, of green wrought Damask made, And seem'd but the fresh Forrests nat'ural shade, Various, and vast within, on pillars born Of Shittim Wood, that usefully adorn. Hither to grace the Nuptial-Feast does Saul Of the Twelve Tribes th' Elders and Captains call, And all around the idle, busie crowd, With shouts and Blessings tell their joy alowd. Lo, the press breaks, and from their several homes In decent pride the Bride and Bridegroom comes. Before the Bride, in a long double row With solemn pace thirty choice Virgins go, And make a Moving Galaxy on earth; All heav'enly Beauties, all of highest Birth; All clad in liveliest colours, fresh and fair, As the bright flowers that crown'd their brighter Hair, All in that new-blown age, which does inspire Warmth in Themselves, in their Beholders Fire. But all this, and all else the Sun did ere, Or Fancy see, in her less bounded Sphere, The Bride her self out-shone; and one would say They made but the faint Dawn to her full Day. Behind a numerous train of Ladies went, Who on their dress much fruitless care had spent, Vain Gems, and unregarded cost they bore, For all mens eyes were ty'd to those before. The Bridegrooms flourishing Troop fill'd next the place, With thirty comly youths of noblest race, That marcht before; and Heav'en around his head, The graceful beams of Joy and Beauty spread. So the glad star which Men and Angels love, Prince of the glorious Host that shines above, No Light of Heav'en so chearful or so gay, Lifts up his sacred Lamp, and opens Day. The King himself, at the Tents crowned gate In all his robes of ceremony' and state Sate to receive the train; on either hand Did the High Priest, and the Great Prophet stand. Adriel behind, Jonathan, Abner, Jesse, And all the Chiefs in their due order presse. First Saul declar'd his choice, and the just cause, Avow'd by' a gene'ral murmur of applause, Then sign'd her Dow're, and in few words he pray'd, And blest, and gave the joyful trembling Maid T' her Lovers hands, who with a chearful look And humble gesture the vast Present took. The Nuptial-Hymn strait sounds, and Musicks play, And Feasts and Balls shorten the thoughtless day To all but to the wedded; till at last The long-wisht night did her kind shadow cast; At last th' inestimable hour was come To lead his Conquering prey in triumph home, To' a Palace near, drest for the Nuptial-bed (Part of her Dowre) he his fair Princess led, Saul, the High-Priest, and Samuel here they leave, Who as they part, their weighty blessings give. Her Vail is now put on; and at the gate The thirty Youths, and thirty Virgins wait With golden Lamps, bright as the flames they bore, To light the Nuptial-pomp, and march before. The rest bring home in state the happy Pair, To that last Scene of Bliss, and leave them there All those free joys insatiably to prove With which rich Beauty feasts the Glutton Love. But scarce, alas, the first sev'en days were past, In which the publick Nuptial Triumphs last, When Saul this new Alliance did repent, Such subtle cares his jealous thoughts torment, He envy'ed the good work himself had done; Fear'd David less his Servant than his Son. No longer his wild wrath could he command; He seeks to stain his own imperial hand In his Sons blood; and that twice cheated too, With Troops and Armies does one life pursue. Said I but One? his thirsty rage extends To th' Lives of all his kindred, and his friends; Ev'en Jonathan had dyed for being so, Had not just God put by th' unnat'ural blow. You see, Sir, the true cause which brings us here; No sullen discontent, or groundless fear, No guilty Act or End calls us from home. Only to breath in peace a while we come, Ready to Serve, and in mean space to Pray For You who us receive, and Him who drives away. DAVIDEIS. The fourth Book. THE CONTENTS. Moab carries his Guests to hunt at Nebo, in the way falls into discourse with David, and desires to know of him the reasons of the Change of Government in Israel, how Saul came to the Crown, and the story of Him and Jonathan. Davids Speech, containing, The state of the Commonwealth under the Judges, the Motives for which the people desired a King; their Deputies speech to Samuel upon that subject, and his reply. The assembling of the People at the Tabernacle to enquire Gods pleasure. Gods Speech. The Character of Saul, his Anointing by Samuel, and Election by Lot; the defection of his people. The war of Nahas King of Ammon against Jabes Gilead; Saul and Jonathans relieving of the Town. Jonathans Character, his single fight with Nahas, whom he slays, and defeats his Army. The confirmation of Sauls Kingdom at Gilgal, and the manner of Samuels quitting his office of Judge. The war with the Philistins at Macmas, their strength, and the weakness of Sauls Forces, his exercising of the Priestly function, and the judgment denounced by Samuel against him. Jonathans discourse with his Esquire; their falling alone upon the enemies out-guards at Senes, and after upon the whole Army, the wonderful defeat of it; Sauls rash vow, by which Jonathan is to be put to death, but is saved by the People. Though state and kind discourse thus rob'd the Night Of half her natural and more just delight, Moab, whom Temp'erance did still vig'orous keep, And regal cares had us'd to mod'erate sleep, Up with the Sun arose, and having thrice With lifted hands bow'd towards his shining rise, And thrice to'wards Phegor, his Baals holiest Hill, (With good and pious prayers directed ill) Call'd to the Chase his Friends, who for him stay'd; The glad Dogs barkt, the chearful Horses neigh'd. Moab his Chariot mounts, drawn by four Steeds, The best and noblest that fresh Zerith breeds, All white as Snow, and sprightful as the Light, With Scarlet trapt, and foaming Gold they bite. He into it young David with him took, Did with respect and wonder on him look Since last nights story, and with greedier ear, The Man, of whom so much he heard, did hear. The well-born Youth of all his flourishing Court March gay behind, and joyful to the sport. Some arm'd with Bows, some with strait Javelines ride; Rich Swords and gilded Quivers grace their side. Midst the fair Troop Davids tall Brethren rode, And Joab comely as a Fanci'ed God; They entertain'd th' attentive Moab Lords, With loose and various talk that chance affords, Whilst they pac'ed slowly on; but the wise King Did Davids tongue to weightier subjects bring. Much (said the King) much I to Joab owe, For the fair Picture drawn by him of you. 'Twas drawn in little, but did acts express So great, that largest Histories are less. I see (methinks) the Gathian Monster still, His shape last night my mindful Dreams did fill. Strange Tyrant Saul with Envy to pursue The praise of deeds whence his own safety grew! I'have heard (but who can think it?) that his Son Has his lifes hazard for your friendship run; His matchless Son, whose worth (if Fame be true) Lifts him 'above all his Countrymen but you, With whom it makes him One; Low David bows, But no reply Moabs swift tongue allows. And pray, kind Guest, whilst we ride thus (says he) (To gameful Nebo still three leagues there be) The story of your royal friend relate; And his ungovern'd Sires imperious fate, Why your great State that nameless Fam'ily chose, And by what steps to Israels Throne they rose. He staid; and David thus; from Egypts Land You 'have heard, Sir, by what strong, unarmed hand Our Fathers came; Moses their sacred Guid, But he in sight of the Giv'en Country dy'd. Deut. 34. His fatal promis'd Canaan was on high; And Joshua's Sword must th' active Rod supply. It did so, and did wonders. Josh. 1. 4. From sacred Jordan to the Western main, From well-clad Lib'anus to the Southern Plain Of naked sands, his winged Conquests went; And thirty Kings to Hell uncrown'd he sent. Josh. 12. Almost four hundred years from him to Saul, In too much freedom past, or forreign thral. Oft Strangers Iron Scepters bruis'd the Land (Such still are those born by a Conquering Hand) Oft pity'ing God did well-form'd Spirits raise, Fit for the toilsome business of their days, To free the groaning Nation, and to give Peace first, and then the Rules in Peace to live. But they whose stamp of Power did chiefly ly In Characters too fine for most mens Ey, Graces and Gifts Divine; not painted bright With state to awe dull minds, and force t'affright, Were ill obey'd whil'st Living, and at death, Their Rules and Pattern vanisht with their breath. The hungry Rich all near them did devour, Their Judge was Appetite, and their Law was Power. Not want it self could Luxury restrain, For what that empti'd, Rapine fill'd again. Robbery the Field, Oppression sackt the Town; What the Swords Reaping spar'd, was glean'd by th'Gown. At Courts, and Seats of Justice to complain, Was to be robb'd more vexingly again. Nor was their Lust less active or less bold, Amidst this rougher search of Blood and Gold. Weak Beauties they corrupt, and force the strong; The Pride of Old Men that, and this of young. You 'have heard perhaps, Sir, of leud Gibeahs shame, Judg. 19. Which Hebrew Tongues still tremble when they name, Alarmed all by one fair strangers Eyes, As to a sudden War the Town does rise Shaking and pale, half dead e're they begin The strange and wanton Trag'edy of their sin, All their wild Lusts they force her to sustain, Till by shame, sorrow, weariness, and pain, She midst their loath'd, and cruel kindness dies; Of monstrous Lust th' innocent Sacrifice. This did ('tis true) a Civil War create (The frequent curse of our loose-govern'd State) All Gibea's, and all Jabes blood it cost; Near a whole Tribe and future Kings we lost. Judg. 20. and 21. Firm in this general Earthquake of the Land, How could Religion, its main pillar, stand? Proud, and fond Man, his Fathers worship hates, Himself, Gods Creature, his own God Creates. Hence in each Houshold sev'eral Deities grew, And when no old one pleas'd, they fram'd a New. The only Land which serv'd but one before, Did th' only then all Nations Gods adore. They serv'd their Gods at first, and soon their Kings; Their choice of that this latter slavery brings. Till special men arm'd with Gods warrant broke By justest force th'unjustly forced yoke. All matchless persons, and thrice worthy they Of Power more great, or Lands more apt t'obey. 1 Sam. 3. At last the Priesthood join'd in Ith'amars Son, More weight and lustre to the Scepter won. But whilst mild Ely, and good Samuel were Busi'ed with age, and th' Altars sacred care; To their wild Sons they their high charge commit, Who 'expose to Scorn and Hate both them and it. Ely's curst House th'exemplar vengeance bears Of all their Blood, and all sad Isr'aels Tears. His Sons abroad, Himself at home lies slain, Israel's captiv'd, Gods Ark and Law are tane. 1 Sam. 4. Thus twice are Nations by ill Princes vext, They suffer By them first, and For them next. Samuel succeeds; since Moses none before So much of God in his bright bosom bore. In vain our arms Philistian Tyrants seis'd; 1 Sam. 7. Heav'ens Magazines he open'd when he pleas'd. He Rains and Winds for Auxil'iaries brought, Ib. v. 10. He muster'd Flames and Thunders when he fought. Thus thirty years with strong and steddy hand He held th'unshaken Ballance of the Land. At last his Sons th'indulgent Father chose To share that State which they were born to lose. Their hateful acts that Changes birth did hast, Which had long growth i'th'Womb of Ages past. To this (for still were some great Periods set, There's a strong knot of sev'eral Causes met) The threats concurr'd of a rough neighb'ring War; A mighty storm long gathering from afar. For Ammon, heightned with mixt Nations aid, Like Torrents swoln with Rain prepar'd the land t'invade. Samuel was old, and by his Sons ill choice Turn'd Dotard in th' unskilful Vulgars voice. His Sons so scorn'd and hated, that the Land Nor hop'ed nor wisht a Victory from their hand: These were the just and faultless causes why The general voice did for a Monarch cry, But God ill grains did in this Incense smell, Wrapt in fair Leaves he saw the Canker dwell. A mut'inous Itch of Change, a dull Despair Of helps divine, oft prov'd; a faithless care Of Common Means; the pride of heart, and scorn Of th' humble yoke under low Judges born. They saw the state and glittering pomp which blest In vulgar sense the Scepters of the East. They saw not Powers true Source, and scorn'd t'obey Persons that look'd no dreadfuller than They. They mist Courts, Guards, a gay and num'erous train; Our Judges, like their Laws, were rude and plain. On an old bench of wood, her Seat of State Judg. 4. 5. Beneath the well-known Palm, Wise Debora sate. Her Maids with comly dil'igence round her spun, And she too, when the Pleadings there were done: With the same Goad Samgar his Oxen drives Which took the Sun before six hundred lives Judg. 3. 31. From his sham'd foes; He midst his work dealt Laws; And oft was his Plow stopt to hear a Cause. Nor did great Gid'eon his old Flail disdain, Judg. 6. 14. After won Fields, sackt Towns, and Princes slain. His Scepter that, and Ophras Threshing Floore The Seat and Embleme of his Justice bore. What should I Jair, the happiest Father, name? Judg. 10. 3. Or mournful Jephta known no less to fame Ib. 11 34. For the most wretched? Both at once did keep The mighty Flocks of Isra'el and their Sheep. Oft from the field in hast they summon'd were Some weighty forreign Embassy to hear, They call'd their Slaves, their Sons, and Friends around, Who all at several cares were scattered found, They washt their feet, their only Gown put on; And this chief work of Cer'emony was done. These reasons, and all else that could be said, In a ripe hour by factious Eloquence spread Through all the Tribes, make all desire a King; And to their Judge selected Dep'uties bring 1 Sam. 8. 3. This harsh demand; which Nacol for the rest (A bold and artful Mouth) thus with much grace exprest. We' are come, most sacred Judge, to pay th'Arrears Of much-ow'd thanks for the bright thirty years Of your just Reign; and at your feet to lay All that our grateful hearts can weakly pay In unproportion'd words; for you alone The not unfit Reward, who seek for none. But when our forepast ills we call to mind, And sadly think how Little's left behind Of your important Life, whose sudden date Would disinherit th'unprovided State. When we consider how unjust 'tis, you, Who nere of Power more than the Burden knew, At once the weight of that and Age should have; Your stooping days prest doubly towards the grave. When we behold by Ammons youthful rage, Proud in th' advantage of your peaceful age, And all th'united East our fall conspir'd; And that your Sons, whom chiefly we desir'd 1 Sam. 8. 5. As Stamps of you, in your lov'd room to place, By unlike acts that noble Stamp deface: Midst these new fears and ills, we're forc'd to fly To' a new, and yet unpractis'd Remedy; A new one, but long promis'd and foretold, By Moses, and to Abraham shown of old. A Prophesie long forming in the Womb Deut. 17. 4. Of teeming years, and now to ripeness come. This Remedy's a King; for this we all With an inspir'd, and zealous Union call. And in one sound when all mens voices join, The Musick's tun'd (no doubt) by hand divine. 'Tis God alone speaks a whole Nations voice; That is his Publique Language; but the choice Of what Peculiar Head that Crown must bear From you who his Peculiar Organ are We'expect to hear; the People shall to you Their King, the King his Crown and People owe. To your great name what lustre will it bring T'have been our Judge, and to have made our King! He bow'd, and ended here; and Samuel streight, 1 Sam. 8. 6. Pawsing a while at this great questions weight, With a grave sigh, and with a thoughtful Ey That more of Care than Passion did descry, Calmly replys: You're sure the first (said he) Of freeborn men that begg'd for Slavery. I fear, my friends, with heav'enly Manna fed, (Our old forefathers crime) we lust for Bread. Long since by God from Bondage drawn, I fear, We build anew th' Egyptian Brickiln here. Cheat not your selves with words: for though a King 1 Sam. 8. 11. Be the mild Name, a Tyrant is the Thing. Let his power loose, and you shall quickly see How mild a thing unbounded Man will be. He'll lead you forth your hearts cheap blood to spill, Where e're his Guidless Passion leads his Will. Ambition, Lust, or Spleen his wars will raise, Your Lives best price his thirst of Wealth or Praise. Your ablest Sons for his proud Guards he'll take, And by such hands your yoke more grievous make. Your Daughters and dear Wives he'll force away, His Lux'ury some, and some his Lust t'obey. His idle friends your hungry toils shall eat, Drink your rich Wines, mixt with your Blood and Sweat. Then you'll all sigh, but sighs will Treasons be; And not your Griefs themselves, or Looks be free. Rob'd even of Hopes, when you these ills sustain, Your watry eyes you'l then turn back in vain, On your old Judges, and perhaps on Me, Nay ev'en my Sons, howe're they 'unhappy be In your displeasure now; Not that I'd clear Their Guilt, or mine own Innocence indear, Witness th' unutterable Name, there's nought Of private ends into this question brought. But why this yoke on your own necks to draw? Why Man your God, and Passion made your Law? Methinks (thus Moab interrupts him here) The good old Seer 'gainst Kings was too severe. 'Tis Jest to tell a People that they're Free, Who, or How many shall their Masters be Is the sole doubt; Laws guid, but cannot reign; And though they bind not Kings, yet they restrain. I dare affirm (so much I trust their Love) That no one Moabite would his speech approve. But, pray go on. 'Tis true, Sir, he replies; Yet men whom age and action renders wise, So much great changes fear, that they believe All evils will, which may from them arrive. On men resolv'd these threats were spent in vain, All that his power or el'oquence could obtain 1 Sam. 8. 19. Was to enquire Gods will e're they proceed To'a work that would so much his blessing need. A solemn day for this great work is set, And at th' Anointed Tent all Israel met Ex. 48. 9. &amp; 30. 26. Expect th' event; Ib. v. 5. 6. below fair bullocks fry In hallowed flames; Ib. v. 5. 6. above, there mount on high The precious clouds of Incense, and at last The Sprinkling, Pray'ers, and all due Honours past. Lo! we the Sacred Bells o'th' sudden hear, Exo. 39. 25. &amp; 28. And in mild pomp grave Samuel does appear. His Ephod, Mitre, well-cut Diadem on, Ex. 39. 2. Ib. 8. Th' Orac'ulous Stones on his rich Breast plate shone. Tow'ards the blew curtains of Gods holiest place (The Temples bright Third Heaven) he turn'd his face. Thrice bow'd he, thrice the solemn Musick plaid, And at third rest thus the great Prophet praid: Almighty God, to whom all men that be Owe all they have, yet none so much as We; Who though thou fill'st the spacious world alone, Thy too small Court, hast made this place thy Throne. With humble Knees, and humbler Hearts, Lo, here, Blest Abrah'ams Seed implores thy gracious Ear. Hear them, great God, and thy just will inspire; From Thee, their long-known King, they'a King desire. Some gracious signs of thy good pleasure send, Which, lo, with Souls resign'd we humbly here attend. He spoke, and thrice he bow'd, and all about Silence and reverend Horrour seiz'd the rout. The whole Tent shakes, the Flames on th' Altar by, In thick dull rolls mount slow and heavily. The Exod. 25. 37. seven Lamps wink; and what does most dismay, Th'Orac'ulous Gems shut in their nat'ural day. The Rubies Cheek grew pale, the Em'eraud by Faded, a Cloud o'recast the Saphirs Skie. The Di'amonds Eye lookt Sleepy, and swift night Of all those little Suns eclypst the Light. Sad signs of Gods dread anger for our sin, But straight a wondrous brightness from within Strook through the Curtains, for no earthly Cloud Could those strong beams of heav'enly glory shroud. The Altars fire burnt pure, and every Stone Their radiant Parent the gay Sun outshone. Beauty th' illustrious Vision did impart To ev'ery Face, and Joy to ev'ery heart. In glad effects Gods presence thus appear'd, And thus in wondrous sounds his Voice was heard: This stubborn Land sins still, nor is it Thee, but Us (Who have been so long their King) they seek to cast off thus. Five hundred rolling years hath this stiff Nation strove To 'exhaust the boundless stores of our unfathom'd Love. Be't so then; yet once more are we resolv'd to try T'outweary them through all their Sins Variety. Assemble ten days hence the num'erous people here; To draw the Royal Lot which our hid Mark shall bear. Dismiss them now in peace; but their next crime shall bring Ruine without redress on Them, and on their King. The Almighty spoke; th' astonisht people part With various stamps imprest on every heart. Some their demand repented, others prais'd, Some had no thoughts at all, but star'd and gaz'd. There dwelt a Man, nam'd Kis in Gib'eah Town, 1 Sam. 9. 1. For wisdom much, and much for Courage known. Ib. v. 2. More for his Son, his mighty Son was Saul, Whom Nature, e're the Lots, to' a Throne did call. He was much Prince, and when, or wheresoe're His birth had been, Then had he reign'd and There. Such Beauty as great Strength thinks no disgrace, Smil'd in the manly features of his Face. His large black Eyes, fill'd with a sprightful light, Shot forth such lively and illustrious Night, As the Sun beams, on Jet reflecting show, His Hair, as black, in long curl'd waves did flow. His tall, strait Body amidst thousands stood, Like some fair Pine o'relooking all th' ignobler Wood. Of all our rural sports he was the pride; So swift, so strong, so dextrous none beside. Rest was his Toil, Labours his Lust and Game; No nat'ural wants could his fierce dil'igence tame, Not Thirst, nor Hunger; he would journeys go Through raging Heats, and take repose in Snow. His Soul was ne're unbent from weighty care; But active as some Mind that turns a Sphere. His way once chose, he forward thrust outright, Nor stept aside for Dangers or Delight. Yet was he wise all dangers to foresee; But born t' affright, and not to fear was He. His Wit was strong; not Fine; and on his tongue An Artless grace above all Eloq'uence hung. These Virtues too the rich unusual dress 1 Sam. 9. 21. Ib. 10. v. 22. Of Modesty adorn'd and Humbleness. Like a clear Varnish o're fair Pictures laid, More fresh and Lasting they the Colours made. Till Power and violent Fortune, which did find No stop or bound, o'rewhelm'd no less his Mind, Did, Deluge-like, the nat'ural forms deface, And brought forth unknown Monsters in their place. Forbid it God, my Masters spots should be, Were they not seen by all, disclos'd by me! But such he was; and now to Ramah went (So God dispos'd) with a strange, low intent. Great God! he went lost Asses to enquire, Ib. v. 8. And a small Present his small questions hire, Brought simply with him to that Man to give, From whom high Heav'ens chief Gifts he must receive, Strange Play of Fate! when might'iest humane things Hang on such small, Imperceptible Strings! 'Twas Samuels Birth-day, a glad ann'ual feast 1 Sam. 9. 12. All Rama kept; Samuel his wondring Guest With such respect leads to it, and does grace Ib. v. 22, 23, 24. With the choice meats o'th' feast, and highest place. Which done, him forth alone the Prophet brings, And feasts his ravisht ears with nobler things. Ib. v. 26. He tells the mighty Fate to him assign'd, And with great rules fills his capacious mind. 1 Sam. 10. 1. Then takes the sacred Viol, and does shed A Crown of mystique drops around his head. Drops of that Royal Moisture which does know No Mixture, and disdains the place below. Soon comes the Kingly Day, and with it brings A new Account of Time upon his wings. 1 Sam. 10. 17. The people met, the rites and pray'rs all past, Behold, the Heav'en instructed-Lot is cast. 'Tis taught by heaven its way, and cannot miss; Forth Benjamin, forth leaps the House of Cis. As Glimm'ering stars just at the'approach of Day, Casheer'd by Troops, at last drop all away, By such degrees all mens bright hopes are gone, And, like the Sun, Sauls Lot shines all alone. Ev'en here perhaps the peoples shout was heard, The loud long shout when Gods fair choice appear'd. Above the whole vast throng he'appear'd so tall, As if by Nature made for th'Head of all. So full of grace and state, that one might know 'Twas some wise Eye the blind Lot guided so. But blind unguided Lots have more of choice And constancy then the slight Vulgars voice. Ere yet the Crown of sacred Oyl is dry, Whil'st Ecchoes yet preserve the joyful cry, Some grow enrag'd their own vain hopes to miss, Some envy Saul, some scorn the house of Cis. Some their first mut'inous wish, A King, repent, As if, since that, quite spoil'd by Gods consent. Few to this Prince their first just duties pay; All leave the Old, but few the New obey. Thus changes Man, but God is constant still To those eternal grounds, that mov'ed his Will. And though he yielded first to them, 'tis fit That stubborn Men at last to him submit. As midst the Main a low small Island lies, Assaulted round with stormy Seas and skies. Whilst the poor heartless Natives ev'ery hour Darkness and Noise seems ready to devour: Such Israels state appear'ed, whilst ore the West Philistian clouds hung threatning, and from th'East All Nations wrath into one Tempest joines, Through which proud Nahas like fierce Lightning shines. Tygris and Nile to his assistance send, And waters to swoln Jaboc's Torrent lend. Seir, Edom, Soba, Amalec adde their force, Up with them march the Three Arabia's Horse. And 'mongst all these none more their hope or pride, Then those few Troops your warlike land supply'ed. Around weak Jabes this vast Host does ly, 1 Sam. 11. 1. Disdains a dry and bloodless Victory. The hopeless Town for Slave'ry does intreat, But barb'arous Nahas thinks that grace too great. He (his first Tribute) their right Eyes demands, Ib. v. 2. And with their Faces shame disarms their Hands. Ver. 3. If unreliev'ed sev'en days by Israels aid, This bargain for ore-rated Life is made. Ah, mighty God, let thine own Israel be Quite blind it self, ere this reproach it see! By'his wanton people the new King forsook, To homely rural cares himself betook. Ver. 5. In private plenty liv'd without the state, Lustre and Noise due to a publique fate. Whilst he his slaves and cattel follows home, Lo the sad Messengers from Jabes come, Implore his help, and weep as if they meant 1 Sam. 11. 4. That way at least proud Nahas to prevent. Mov'ed with a Kingly wrath, his strict command Ver. 7. He issues forth t'assemble all the land. He threatens high, and disobedient they Wak'ed by such Princely terrors learnt t'obey. Ver. 8. A mighty Host is rais'd; th'important cause Age from their Rest; Youth, from their Pleasure draws. Arm'd as unfurnisht Hast could them provide, But Conduct, Courage, Anger that supply'ed. All night they march, and are at th'early dawn On Jabes heath in three fair bodies drawn. Saul did himself the first and strongest band, 1 Sam. 11. 11. His Son the next, Abner the third command. But pardon, Sir, if naming Sauls great Son, I stop with him a while ere I go on. This is that Jonathan, the Joy and Grace, The beautifull'st, and best of Humane Race. That Jonathan in whom does mixt remain All that kind Mothers wishes can contain. His Courage such as it no stop can know, And Vict'ory gains by'astonishing the Foe. With Lightnings force his enemies it confounds, And melts their Hearts e're it the Bosom wounds. Yet he the Conquer'd with such Sweetness gains, As Captive Lovers find in Beauties Chains. In war the adverse Troops he does assail, Like an impet'uous storm of wind and Hail. In Peace, like gentlest Dew that does asswage The burning Months, and temper Syrius rage. Kind as the Suns blest Influence; and where e're He comes, Plenty and Joy attend him there. To Help seems all his Power, his Wealth to Give; To do much Good his sole Prerogative. And yet this gen'eral Bounty of his Mind, That with wide arms embraces all Mankind, Such artful Prudence does to each divide, With diffe'rent measures all are satisfi'd. Just as wise God his plenteous Manna dealt, Exod. 16. 18. Some gather'd more, but want by none was felt. To all Relations their just rights he pays, And worths reward above its claim does raise. The tendrest Husband, Master, Father, Son, And all those parts by'his Friendship far outdone. His Love to Friends no bound or rule does know, What He to Heav'en, all that to Him they owe. Keen as his Sword, and pointed is his Wit: His Judgment, like best Armour, strong and fit. And such an El'oquence to both these does join, As makes in both Beauty and Use combine. Through which a noble Tincture does appear By Learning and choice Books imprinted there. As well he knows all Times and Persons gone, As he himself to th' future shall be known. But his chief study is Gods sacred Law; And all his Life does Comments on it draw, As never more by Heav'en to Man was giv'en, So never more was paid by Man to Heav'en. And all these Virtues were to Ripeness grown, E're yet his Flower of Youth was fully blown. All Autumns store did his rich Spring adorn; Like Trees in Par'dice he with Fruit was born. Such is his Soul; and if, as some men tell, Souls form and build those mansions where they dwell; Whoe're but sees his Body must confess, The Architect no doubt, could be no less. From Saul his growth and manly strength he took, Chastis'd by bright Ahino'ams gentler look. Not bright Ahin'oam, Beauties lowdest Name, Till she to' her Children lost with joy her fame, 1 Sam. 14. 50. Had sweeter strokes, Colours more fresh and fair, More darting Eyes, or lovelier auborn Hair. Forgive me that I thus your patience wrong, And on this boundless subject stay so long. Where too much hast ever to end t'would be, Did not his Acts speak what's untold by Me. Though from the time his hands a Sword could wield, He ne're mist Fame and Danger in the field. Yet this was the first day that call'd him forth, Since Sauls bright Crown gave luster to his worth. 'Twas the last morning whose unchearful rise, Sad Jabes was to view with both their Eyes. Secure proud Nahas slept as in his Court, And dreamt, vain man! of that days barb'arous sport, Till noise and dreadful tumults him awoke; Till into'his Camp our vi'olent Army broke. The careless Guards with small re[s]istance kill'd, Slaughter the Camp, and wild Confusion fill'd. Nahas his fatal duty does perform, And marches boldly up t'outface the storm. Fierce Jonathan he meets, as he pursues Th' Arabian Horse, and a hot fight renewes. 'Twas here your Troops behav'd themselves so well, Till Uz and Jathan their stout Col'onels fell. 'Twas here our Vict'ory stopt, and gave us cause. Much to suspect th'intention of her pause. But when our thundring Prince Nahas espy'd, Who with a Courage equal to his Pride Broke through our Troops, and tow'ards him boldly prest, A gen'erous joy leapt in his youthful brest. As when a wrathful Dragons dismal light Strikes suddenly some warlike Eagles sight. The mighty foe pleases his fearless eyes, He claps his joyful wings, and at him flies. With vain, though vi'olent force, their darts they flung; In Ammons plated belt Jonathans hung, And stopt there; Ammon did his Helmet hit, And gliding off, bore the proud crest from it. Straight with their Swords to the fierce shock they came, Their Swords, their Armour, and their Eyes shot flame. Blows strong as Thunder, thick as Rain they delt; Which more then they th'engag'ed Spectators felt. In Ammon force, in Jonathan address, (Though both were great in both to an excess) To the well-judging Eye did most appear; Honour, and Anger in both equal were. Two wounds our Prince receiv'ed, and Ammon three; Which he enrag'ed to feel, and 'sham'd to see, Did his whole strength into one blow collect; And as a Spani'el when we'our aim direct To shoot some Bird, impatiently stands by Shaking his tail, ready with joy to fly Just as it drops, upon the wounded prey; So waited Death it self to bear away The threatned Life; did glad and greedy stand At sight of mighty Ammons lifted hand. Our watchful Prince by bending sav'd the wound, But Death in other coyn his reck'ning found: For whilst th'immod'erate strokes miscarry'ng force Had almost born the striker from his horse, A nimble thrust his active En'emy made, 'Twixt his right ribs deep pierc'ed the furious blade, And opened wide those secret vessels, where Life's Light goes out, when first they let in aire. He falls, his Armour clanks against the ground, From his faint tongue imperfect curses sound. His amaz'd Troops strait cast their arms away; Scarce fled his Soul from thence more swift then they. As when two Kings of neighbour Hives (whom rage And thirst of Empire in fierce wars engage, Whilst each lays claim to th'Garden as his owne, And seeks t'usurp the bord'ring flowers alone) Their well-arm'd Troops drawn boldly forth to fight, In th'aires wide plain dispute their doubtful right. If by sad chance of battel either King Fall wounded down, strook with some fatal sting, His Armies hopes and courage with him dy; They sheath up their faint Swords, and routed fly. On th'other sides at once with like success Into the Camp, great Saul and Abner press, From Jon'athans part a wild mixt noise they hear, And whatsoere it mean long to be there, At the same instant from glad Jabes Town, The hasty Troops march loud and chearful down. Some few at first with vain resistance fall, The rest is Slaughter, and vast Conquest all. The fate by which our Host thus far had gon, Our Host with noble heat drove farther on. Victorious arms through Ammons land it bore; Ruine behind, and Terror marcht before. Where ere from Rabba's towers they cast their sight, Smoak clouds the Day, and Flames make clear the Night. This bright success did Sauls first action bring, The Oyl, the Lot, and Crown less crown'd him King. The Happy all men judge for Empire fit, And none withstands where Fortune does submit. Those who before did Gods fair choice withstand, 1 Sam. 11. 12. Th'excessive Vulgar now to death demand. But wiser Saul repeal'd their hasty doom; Ver. 13. Conquest abroad, with Mercy crown'd at home. Nor stain'd with civil slaughter that days pride, Which foreign blood in nobler purple dy'ed. Again the Crown th'assembled people give, Ver. 15. With greater joy then Saul could it receive. Again, th'old Judge resigns his sacred place, 1 Sam. 12. 1. God Glorifi'ed with wonders his disgrace. With decent pride, such as did well befit The Name he kept, and that which he did quit. The long-past row of happy years he show'd, Which to his heav'enly Government they ow'd. How the torn state his just and prudent raign Restor'ed to Order, Plenty, Power again. In war what conqu'ering Miracles he wrought; God, then their King, was Gen'eral when they fought. Whom they depos'ed with him. And that (said he) You may see God concern'd in't more then Me, Behold how storms his angry presence shrowd, Hark how his wrath in thunder threats alowd. 'Twas now the ripen'ed Summers highest rage, Which no faint cloud durst mediate to asswage. Th'Earth hot with Thirst, and hot with Lust for Rain, Gap'ed, and breath'd feeble vapours up in vain, Which straight were scatter'd, or devour'd by th'Sun; When, Lo, ere scarce the active speech was done, A vi'olent Wind rose from his secret Cave, And troops of frighted Clouds before it drave. Whilst with rude haste the confus'ed Tempest crowds, Swift dreadful flames shot through th'encountring clowds, From whose torn womb th'imprison'ed Thunder broke, And in dire sounds the Prophets sense it spoke. Such an impet'uous shower it downwards sent, As if the Waters 'bove the Firmament Were all let loose; Horrour and fearful noise Fill'd the black Scene; till the great Prophets voice Swift as the wings of Morn, reduc'ed the Day; Wind, Thunder, Rain and Clouds fled all at once away. Fear not (said he) God his fierce wrath removes, 1 Sam. 12. 20. And though this State my service disapproves, My Prayers shall serve it constantly. No more, I hope, a pardon for past sins t'implore, But just rewards from gracious heav'en to bring On the good deeds of you, and of our King. Behold him there! and as you see, rejoyce In the kind care of Gods impartial choice. Behold his Beauty, Courage, Strength and Wit! The Honour heav'en has cloath'd him with, sits fit And comely on him; since you needs must be Rule'd by a King, you'are happy that 'tis He. Obey him gladly, and let him too know You were not made for Him, but he for You, And both for God. Whose gentlest yoke if once you cast away, In vain shall he command, and you obey. To foreign Tyrants both shall slaves become, Instead of King, and Subjects here at home. Ib. v. 25. The Crown thus several ways confirm'ed to Saul, One way was wanting yet to crown them all; And that was Force, which only can maintain The Power that Fortune gives, or worth does gain. Three thousand Guards of big, bold men he took; 1 Sam. 13. 2. Tall, terrible, and Guards ev'en with their Look; His sacred person too, and throne defend, The third on matchless Jonathan attend. Ore whose full thoughts, Honour, and youthful Heat, Sate brooding to hatch Actions good and great. On Geba first, where a Philistian band Ib. 3. Lies, and around torments the fetter'd land, He falls, and slaughters all; his noble rage Mixt with Design his Nation to engage In that just war, which from them long in vain, Honour and Freedoms voice had strove t'obtain. Th'accurst Philistian rows'd with this bold blow, Ib. v. 5. All the proud marks of enrag'ed Power does show. Raises a vast, well-arm'd, and glittering Host, If humane strength might authorize a boast, Their threats had reason here; for ne're did wee Our selves so weak, or foe so potent see. Here we vast bodies of their Foot espy, The Rear out-reaches far th'extended Eye. Like fields of Corn their armed Squadrons stand; As thick and numberless they hide the land. Here with sharp neighs the warlike Horses sound; And with proud prancings beat the putrid ground. Here with worse noise three thousand Chariots pass With plates of Iron bound, or louder Brass. About it forks, axes, and sithes, and spears, Whole Magazines of Death each Chariot bears. Where it breaks in, there a whole Troop it mows, And with lopt panting limbs the field bestrows. Alike the Valiant, and the Cowards dy; Neither can they resist, nor can these fly. Ib. v. 5. Ver. 7. In this proud equipage at Macmas they; Saul in much different state at Gilgal lay. His forces seem'd no Army, but a Crowd, Heartless, unarm'd, disorderly, and lowd. The quick Contagion Fear ran swift through all, And into trembling Fits th'infected fall. Saul, and his Son (for no such faint Disease Could on their strong-complexion'd Valour seise) In vain all parts of virtuous Conduct show'd, And on deaf Terror gen'erous words bestow'd. Thousands from thence fly scattered ev'ery day; Thick as the Leaves that shake and drop away, When they th'approach of stormy Winter find The noble Tree all bare expos'd to the' Wind. Some to sad Jordan fly, and swim't for hast, And from his farther bank look back at last. Some into woods and caves their cattel drive, There with their Beasts on equal terms they live, Nor deserve better; some in rocks on high, The old retreats of Storks and Ravens ly. And were they wing'ed like them, scarce would they dare To stay, or trust their frighted safety there. As th'Host with fear, so Saul disturb'd with care, Ib. 8. T'avert these ills by Sacrifice and Prayer, And Gods blest will t'enquire, for Samuel sends; Whom he six days with troubled hast attends. But ere the seventh unlucky day (the last By Samuel set for this great work) was past, Saul (alarm'd hourly from the neighb'ring foe, Impatient ere Gods time Gods mind to know, 'Sham'd and enrag'ed to see his Troops decay, Jealous of an affront in Samuels stay, Scorning that any's presence should appear Needful besides when He himself was there; And with a pride too nat'ural thinking Heaven Had given him All, because much Power t'had giv'en) Himself the Sacrifice and Offring's made, Himself did th'high selected charge invade, Himself inquir'ed of God; who then spake nought; But Samuel straight his dreadful answer brought. For straight he came, and with a Virtue bold, As was Sauls sin, the fatal Message told. His foul Ingratitude to heav'en he chid, To pluck that Fruit which was alone forbid To Kingly power in all that plenteous land, Where all things else submit to his command. And as fair Edens violated Tree, To'Immortal Man brought in Mortalitie: So shall that Crown, which God eternal meant, From thee (said he) and thy great house be rent, Thy Crime shall Death to all thine Honours send, And give thy'Immortal Royalty an End. Thus spoke the Prophet, but kind heav'en (we hope) (Whose threats and anger know no other scope But Mans Amendment) does long since relent, And with Repentant Saul it self Repent. Howere (though none more pray for this then we Whose wrongs and sufferings might some colour be To do it less) this speech we sadly find Still extant, and still active in his Mind. But then a worse effect of it appear'd; Our Army which before Modestly fear'd, Which did by stealth and by degrees decay, Disbanded now, and fled in troops away. Base Fear so bold and impudent does grow, When an excuse and colour it can show. Six hundred only (scarce a Princely train) 1 Sam. 13. 15. Of all his Host with distrest Saul remain, Of his whole Host six hundred; and ev'en those (So did wise Heaven for mighty ends dispose, Nor would that useless Multitudes should share In that great Gift it did for One prepare) Arm'd not like Souldiers marching in a War, But Country-Hinds alarmed from afar By Wolves loud hunger, when the well-known sound Raises th' affrighted Villages around. Ib. v. 19, 20, 21. Some Goads, Flails, Plow-shares, Forks, or Axes bore, Made for Lifes use and better ends before, Some knotted Clubs, and Darts, or Arrows dry'd I'th'fire, the first rude arts that Malice try'd, E're Man the sins of too much Knowledge knew, And Death by long Experience witty grew. Such were the Numbers, such the Arms which we Had by fate left us for a Victorie O're well-arm'd Millions; nor will this appear Useful it self, when Jonathan was there. 'Twas just the time when the new Ebb of Night Did the moist world unvail to humane sight. The Prince, who all that night the field had beat With a small party, and no en'emy met (So proud and so secure the en'emy lay, And drencht in sleep th'excesses of the day) With joy this good occasion did embrace, With better leisure, and at nearer space, The strength and order of their Camp to view; Abdon alone his gen'erous purpose knew; Abdon a bold, a brave, and comely Youth, Well-born, well-bred, with Honour fill'd and Truth, Abdon his faithful Squire, whom much he lov'd, And oft with grief his worth in dangers prov'd. Abdon, whose love to'his Master did exceed What Natures Law, or Passions Power could breed, Abdon alone did on him now attend; His humblest Servant, and his dearest Friend. 1 Sam. 14. 1. They went, but sacred fury as they went, Chang'd swiftly, and exalted his intent. What may this be (the Prince breaks forth) I find, God or some powerful Spirit invades my mind. From ought but Heaven can never sure be brought So high, so glorious, and so vast a thought. Nor would ill Fate that meant me to surprise, Come cloath'd in so unlikely a Disguise. Yon Host, which its proud Fishes spreads so wide, O're the whole Land, like some swoln Rivers Tide, Which terrible and numberless appears, As the thick Waves which their rough Ocean bears, Which lies so strongly ['e]ncampt, that one would say The Hill might be remov'd as soon as they, We two alone must fight with and defeat; Thou'rt strook, and startest at a sound so great. Yet we must do't; God our weak hands has chose T'ashame the boasted numbers of our Foes, Which to his strength no more proportion'd be, Than Millions are of Hours to his Eternitie. If when their careless Guards espy us here, With sportful scorn they call to' us to come neer, 1 Sam. 14. We'll boldly climb the Hill, and charge them all; Not They, but Israels Angel gives the call. He spoke, and as he spoke, a Light divine Did from his Eyes, and round his Temples shine, Louder his Voice, larger his Limbs appear'd; Less seem'd the num'erous Army to be fear'd. This saw, and heard with joy the brave Esquire, As he with Gods, fill'd with his Masters Fire. Forbid it Heav'en (said he) I should decline, 1 Sam. 14. Or wish (Sir) not to make your danger mine. The great Example which I daily see Of your high worth is not so lost on me; If wonder-strook I at your words appear, My wonder yet is Innocent of Fear. Th' Honour which does your Princely breast enflame, Warms mine too, and joins there with Duties Name. If in this Act ill Fate our Tempter be, May all the Ill it means be aim'd at me. But sure, I think, God leads, nor could you bring So high thoughts from a less exalted Spring. Bright signs through all your words and looks are spread, A rising Vict'ory dawns around your head. With such discourse blowing their sacred flame, Lo to the fatal place and work they came. Strongly encampt on a steep Hills large head, Like some vast wood the mighty Host was spread. Ib. v. 4. Th' only 'access on neighb'ring Gabaa's side, An hard and narrow way, which did divide Two cliffy Rocks, Boses and Senes nam'd, Much for themselves, and their big strangeness fam'd, More for their Fortune, and this stranger day; On both their points Philistian out-guards lay; From whence the two bold Spies they first espy'd; And, lo! the Hebrews! proud Elcanor cry'd; From Senes top; Lo; from their hungry Caves A quicker Fate here sends them to their graves. Come up (aloud he crys to them below) Ye' Egyptian Slaves, and to our Mercy owe The rebel lives long since to' our Justice due; Scarce from his lips the fatal Omen flew, When th'inspir'd Prince did nimbly understand God, and his God-like Virtues high command. It call'd him up, and up the steep ascent With pain and labour, hast and joy they went. Elcanor laught to see them climb, and thought His mighty words th' affrighted Suppliants brought, Did new affronts to the great Hebrew Name, (The barbarous!) in his wanton Fancy frame. Short was his sport; for swift as Thunders stroke Rives the frail Trunk of some heav'en-threatning Oak, The Princes Sword did his proud head divide; The parted Scull hung down on either side. Just as he fell, his vengeful Steel he drew Half way; no more the trembling Joints could do, Which Abdon snatcht, and dy'ed it in the blood Of an amazed wretch that next him stood. Some close to earth shaking and grove'ling ly, Like Larks when they the Tyrant Hobby spy. Some wonder strook stand fixt; some fly, some arm Wildly, at th' unintelligible Alarm. Like the main Channel of an high-swoln Flood, In vain by Dikes and broken works withstood: So Jonathan, once climb'd th'opposing hill, Does all around with noise and ruine fill. Like some large Arm of which another way Abdon o'reflows; him too no bank can stay. With cryes th' affrighted Country flies before, Behind the following waters lowdly roar. Twenty at least slain on this out-guard ly, To th' adjoin'd Camp the rest distracted fly, And ill mixt wonders tell, and into't bear, Blind terrour, deaf disorder, helpless fear. The Conqu'erors too press boldly in behind, Doubling the wild confusions which they find. Hamgar at first, the Prince of Ashdod Town, Chief 'mongst the Five in riches and renown, 1 Sam. 6. And General then by course oppos'd their way, Till drown'd in Death at Jonathans feet he lay, And curst the Heavens for rage, and bit the ground; His Life for ever spilt stain'd all the grass around. His Brother too, who vertuous hast did make His fortune to revenge, or to partake, Falls grove'ling o're his trunk, on mother earth; Death mixt no less their Bloods than did their birth. Mean while the well-pleas'd Abdons restless Sword Dispatcht the following train t'attend their Lord. On still o're panting corps great Jonathan led; Hundreds before him fell, and Thousands fled. Prodigious Prince! which does most wondrous show, Thy' Attempt, or thy Success! thy Fate or Thou! Who durst alone that dreadful Host assail, With purpose not to Dye, but to Prevail! Infinite Numbers thee no more affright, Then God, whose Unity is Infinite. If Heav'en to men such mighty thoughts would give, What Breast but thine capacious to receive The vast Infusion? or what Soul but Thine Durst have believ'd that Thought to be Divine? Thou follow'dst Heaven in the Design, and we Find in the Act 'twas Heav'en that follow'd Thee. 1 Sam. 14. 15. Thou ledst on Angels, and that sacred band (The De'ities great Lieut'enant) didst command. 'Tis true, Sir, and no Figure, when I say Angels themselves fought under him that day. Clouds with ripe Thunder charg'd some thither drew, And some the dire Materials brought for new. Hot drops of Southern Showers (the sweats of Death) The voyce of storms and winged whirl-winds breath: The flames shot forth from fighting Dragons Eyes, The smokes that from scorcht Fevers Ovens rise, The reddest fires with which sad Comets glow; And Sodoms neighb'ring Lake did spir'its bestow Of finest Sulphur; amongst which they put Wrath, Fury, Horrour, and all mingled shut Into a cold moist Cloud, t'enflame it more; And make th'enraged Prisoner louder roar. Th'assembled Clouds burst o're their Armies head; Noise, Darkness, dismal Lightnings round them spread. Another Spir'it with a more potent wand Than that which Nature fear'd in Moses hand, And went the way that pleas'd, the Mountain strook; The Mountain felt it; the vast Mountain shook. Through the wide ayr another Angel flew About their Host, and thick amongst them threw Discord, Despair, Confusion, Fear, Mistake; And all th' Ingredients that swift ruine make. The fertile glebe requires no time to breed; It quickens and receives at once the Seed. One would have thought, this dismal day to'have seen, That Natures self in her Death-pangs had been. Such will the face of that great hour appear; Such the distracted Sinners conscious fear. In vain some few strive the wild flight to stay; In vain they threaten, and in vain they pray; Unheard, unheeded, trodden down they ly, Beneath the wretched feet of crouds that fly. O're their own Foot trampled the vi'olent Horse. The guidless Chariots with impet'uous course Cut wide through both; and all their bloody way Horses, and Men, torn, bruis'd, and mangled lay. Some from the Rocks cast themselves down headlong; The faint weak Passion grows so bold and strong. To almost certain present death they fly From a remote and causeless fear to dy. Much diffe'rent error did some troops possess; And Madness that lookt better, though no less. 1 Sam. 14. 20. Their fellow troops for th'entred foe they take; And Isra'els war with mutual slaughter make. Mean while the King from Gabaas hill did view, Ib. v. 16. And hear the thickning Tumult as it grew Still great and loud; and though he knows not why They fled, no more then they themselves that fly; Yet by the storms and terrors of the aire, Guesses some vengeful Sp'irits working there; Obeys the loud occasions sacred call, And fiercely on the trembling Host does fall. At the same time their Slaves and Prisoners rise; Ib. 21. Nor does their much-wisht Liberty suffice Without Revenge; the scatter'd arms they seise, And their proud vengeance with the memory please Of who so lately bore them; All about Ib. v. 22. From Rocks and Caves the Hebrews issue out At the glad noise; joy'd that their foes had shown A fear that drowns the scandal of their own. Still did the Prince midst all this storm appeare, Still scatter'd Deaths and Terrors every where. Still did he break, still blunt his wearied Swords; Still slaughter new supplies to'his hand affords. Where troops yet stood, there still he hotly flew, And till at last all fled, scorn'd to pursue. All fled at last, but many in vain; for still Th'insatiate Conqu'eror was more swift to kill Then they to save their Lives. Till, lo! at last, Nature, whose power he had so long surpast, Would yield no more, but to him stronger foes, Drought, faintness, and fierce Hunger did oppose. Reeking all o're in dust, and blood, and sweat, Burnt with the Suns and violent actions heat, 'Gainst an old Oak his trembling Limbs he staid, For some short ease; Fate in th'old Oak had laid Provisions up for his relief; and Lo! The hollow trunck did with bright Honey flow. 1 Sam. 14. 27. With timely food his decay'd Sp'irits recruit; Strong he returns, and fresh to the pursuit, His strength and sp'irits the Honey did restore; But, oh, the bitter-sweet strange poison bore! Behold, Sir, and mark well the treach'erous fate, That does so close on humane glories wait! Behold the strong, and yet fantastick Net T'ensnare triumphant Virtue darkly set! Could it before (scarce can it since) be thought, The Prince who had alone that morning fought, A Duel with an Host, had th'Host orethrowne, And threescore thousand hands disarm'd with One; Washt off his Countrys shame, and doubly dyde In Blood and Blushes the Philistian pride, Had sav'ed and fixt his Fathers tott'ering Crown, And the bright Gold new burnisht with renown, Should be e're night by's King and Fathers breath, Without a fault, vow'd and condemn'd to death? Destin'ed the bloody Sacrifice to be Of Thanks Himself for his own Victorie? Alone with various fate like to become, Fighting, an Host; Dying, an Hecatombe? Yet such, Sir, was his case. 1 Sam. 14. 24. For Saul who fear'd lest the full plenty might (In the abandon'ed Camp expos'ed to sight) His hungry men from the pursuit diswade; A rash, but solemn vow to heav'en had made. Curst be the wretch, thrice cursed let him be Who shall touch food this busie day (said he) Whil'st the blest Sun does with his fav'ouring light Assist our vengeful Swords against their flight. Be he thrice curst; and if his Life we spare, On us those Curses fall that he should bear. Such was the Kings rash vow; who little thought How near to him Fate th' Application brought. The two-edg'd Oath, wounds deep, perform'd or broke; Ev'en Perjury its least and bluntest stroke. 'Twas his own Son, whom God and Mankind lov'ed, His own victorious Son that he devov'ed; On whose bright head the baleful Curses light; But Providence, his Helmet in the fight, Forbids their entrance or their setling there; They with brute sound dissolv'ed into the ayre. Him what Religion, or what vow could bind, Unknown, unheard of, till he'his Life did find Entangled in't? whilst wonders he did do Must he dye now for not be'ing Prophet too? To all but him this Oath was meant and said; He afar off, the ends for which 'twas made Was acting then, till faint and out of breath, He grew half dead with toil of giving death. What could his Crime in this condition be, Excus'ed by Ign'orance and Necessitie? Yet the remorseless King, who did disdain That man should hear him swear or threat in vain, Though'gainst himself; or fate a way should see By which attaqu'ed and conquer'd he might be: Who thought Compassion, female weakness here, And Equity Injustice would appeare In his own Cause; who falsely fear'd beside The solemn Curse on Jon'athan did abide, And the infected Limb not cut away, Would like a Gangrene o're all Isra'el stray; Prepar'ed this God-like Sacrifice to kill; And his rash vow more rashly to fulfil. What tongue can th'horror and amazement tell Which on all Israel that sad moment fell? Tamer had been their grief, fewer their tears, Had the Philistian fate that day bin theirs. Not Sauls proud heart could master his swoln Ey; The Prince alone stood mild and patient by, So bright his sufferings, so triumphant show'd, Less to the best then worst of fates he ow'ed. A victory now he o're himself might boast; He Conquer'd now that Conqu'eror of an Host. It charm'd through tears the sad Spectators sight, Did reverence, love, and gratitude excite And pious rage, with which inspir'ed they now Oppose to Sauls a better publick Vow. They all consent all Israel ought to be Accurst and kill'd themselves rather then He. Thus wi[t]h kind force they the glad King withstood, 1 Sam. 14. 45. And sav'ed their wondrous Saviours sacred blood. Thus David spoke; and much did yet remain Behind th'attentive Prince to entertain, Edom and Zoba's war, for what befel Ib. v. 47. In that of Moab, was known there too well. The boundless quarrel with curst Am'alecs land; 1 Sam. 15. 3. Where Heav'en it self did Cruelty command And practis'ed on Sauls Mercy, nor did e're More punish Inno'cent Blood, then Pity there. Ib. 23. But, Lo! they 'arriv'ed now at th'appointed place; Well-chosen and well furnisht for the Chase. Verses written on several occasions. CHRISTS PASSION Taken out of a Greek Ode, written by Mr. Masters of New College in Oxford. 1. Enough, my Muse, of Earthly things, And inspirations but of wind, Take up thy Lute, and to it bind Loud and everlasting strings; And on 'em play, and to 'em sing, The happy mournful stories, The Lamentable glories, Of the great Crucified King. Mountainous heap of wonders! which do'st rise Till Earth thou joynest with the Skies! Too large at bottom, and at top too high, To be half seen by mortal eye. How shall I grasp this boundless thing? What shall I play? what shall I sing? I'll sing the Mighty riddle of mysterious love, Which neither wretched men below, nor blessed Spirits above With all their Comments can explain; How all the whole Worlds Life to die did not disdain. 2. I'll sing the Searchless depths of the Compassion Divine, The depths unfathom'd yet By reasons Plummet, and the line of Wit, Too light the Plummet, and too short the line, How the Eternal Father did bestow His own Eternal Son as ransom for his Foe, I'll sing aloud, that all the World may hear, The Triumph of the buried Conquerer. How Hell was by its Pris'ner Captive led, And the great slayer Death slain by the Dead. 3. Me thinks I hear of murthered men the voice, Mixt with the Murderers confused noise, Sound from the top of Calvarie; My greedy eyes fly up the Hill, and see Who 'tis hangs there the midmost of the three; Oh how unlike the others he! Look how he bends his gentle head with blessings from the Tree! His gracious Hands ne'r stretcht but to do good, Are nail'd to the infamous wood: And sinful Man do's fondly bind The Arms, which he extends t'embrace all humane kind. 4. Unhappy Man, canst thou stand by, and see All this as patient, as he? Since he thy Sins do's bear, Make thou his sufferings thine own, And weep, and sigh, and groan, And beat thy Breast, and tear, Thy Garments, and thy Hair, And let thy grief, and let thy love Through all thy bleeding bowels move. Do'st thou not see thy Prince in purple clad all o're, Not purple brought from the Sidonian shore, But made at home with richer gore? Dost thou not see the Roses, which adorn The thorny Garland, by him worn? Dost thou not see the livid traces Of the sharp scourges rude embraces? If yet thou feelest not the smart Of Thorns and Scourges in thy heart, If that be yet not crucifi'd, Look on his Hands, look on his Feet, look on his Side. 5. Open, Oh! open wide the Fountains of thine eyes, And let 'em call Their stock of moisture forth, where e're it lies, For this will ask it all. 'Twould all (alas) too little be, Though thy salt tears came from a Sea: Canst thou deny him this, when he Has open'd all his vital Springs for thee? Take heed; for by his sides misterious flood May well be understood, That he will still require some waters to his blood. On Orinda's Poems. ODE. [[1.]] We allow'd You Beauty, and we did submit To all the Tyrannies of it; Ah! Cruel Sex, will you depose us too in Wit? Orinda does in that too raign, Does Man behind her in Proud Triumph draw, And Cancel great Apollo's Salick Law. We our old Title plead in vain, Man may be Head, but Woman's now the Brain. Verse was Loves Fire-arms heretofore, In Beauties Camp it was not known, Too many Arms besides that Conquerour bore: 'Twas the great Canon we brought down T'assault a stubborn Town; Orinda first did a bold sally make, Our strongest Quarter take, And so successful prov'd, that she Turn'd upon Love himself his own Artillery. 2. Women as if the Body were their Whole, Did that, and not the Soul Transmit to their Posterity; If in it sometime they conceiv'd, Th' abortive Issue never liv'd. 'Twere shame and pity' Orinda, if in thee A Spirit so rich, so noble, and so high Should unmanur'd, or barren lye. But thou industriously hast sow'd and till'd The fair, and fruitful field; And 'tis a strange increase, that it does yield. As when the happy Gods above Meet altogether at a feast, A secret Joy unspeakably does move, In their great Mother Cybele's contented breast: With no less pleasure thou methinks shouldst see, This thy no less immortal Progenie. And in their Birth thou no one touch dost find, Of th' ancient curse to Woman-kind, Thou bringst not forth with pain, It neither Travel is, nor labour of the brain, So easily they from thee come, And there is so much room In th' unexhausted and unfathom'd Womb, That like the Holland Countess thou mayst bear A child for every day of all the fertil year. 3. Thou dost my wonder, wouldst my envy raise If to be prais'd I lov'd more than to praise, Where e're I see an excellence, I must admire to see thy well knit sense, Thy numbers gentle, and thy Fancies high, Those as thy forehead smooth, these sparkling as thine eye. 'Tis solid, and 'tis manly all, Or rather 'tis Angelical, For as in Angels, we Do in thy Verses see Both improv'd Sexes eminently meet, They are than Man more strong, and more than Woman sweet. 4. They talk of Nine, I know not who, Female Chimera's that o're Poets reign, I ne'r could find that fancy true, But have invok'd them oft I'm sure in vain: They talk of Sappho, but alas, the shame! Ill manners soil the lustre of her Fame: Orinda's inward virtue is so bright, That like a Lanthorn's fair inclosed Light, It through the Paper shines where she do's write. Honour and Friendship, and the generous scorn Of things for which we were not born, (Things that can only by a fond Disease, Like that of Girles, our vicious Stomachs please) Are the instructive Subjects of her pen, And as the Roman Victory Taught our rude Land, Arts, and Civility, At once she overcomes, enslaves, and betters Men. 5. But Rome with all her Arts could ne'r inspire, A Female Breast with such a fire. The warlike Amazonian train, Who in Elysium now do peaceful reign, And wits milde Empire before Arms prefer, Hope 'twill be setled in their sex by her. Merlin the Seer, (and sure he would not ly, In such a sacred Company,) Does Prophecies of Learn'd Orinda show, Which he had darkly spoke so long ago. Ev'n Boadicia's angry Ghost Forgets her own misfortune, and disgrace, And to her injur'd Daughters now does boast, That Rome's o'ercome at last, by a woman of her Race. ODE. Upon occasion of a Copy of Verses of my Lord Broghills. [[1.]] Be gon (said I) Ingrateful Muse, and see What others thou canst fool as well as me. Since I grew Man, and wiser ought to be, My business and my hopes I left for thee: For thee (which was more hardly given away) I left, even when a Boy, my Play. But say, Ingrateful Mistress, say, What for all this, what didst Thou ever pay? Thou'lt say, perhaps, that Riches are Not of the growth of Lands, where thou dost Trade, And I, as well my Countrey might upbraid Because I have no vineyard there. Well: but in Love, thou dost pretend to Reign, There thine the power and Lordship is, Thou bad'st me write, and write, and write again; 'Twas such a way as could not miss. I like a Fool, did thee Obey, I wrote, and wrote, but still I wrote in vain, For after all my expense of Wit and Pain, A rich, unwriting Hand, carry'd the Prize away. 2. Thus I complain'd, and straight the Muse reply'd, That she had given me Fame. Bounty Immense! And that too must be try'd, When I my self am nothing but a name. Who now, what Reader does not strive T'invalidate the gift whilst w'are alive? For when a Poet now himself doth show, As if he were a common Foe, All draw upon him, all around, And every part of him they wound, Happy the Man that gives the deepest blow: And this is all, kind Muse, to thee we owe. Then in a rage I took And out at window threw Ovid and Horace, all the chiming Crew, Homer himself went with them too, Hardly escap'd the sacred Mantuan Book: I my own Off-spring, like Agave tore And I resolv'd, nay and I think I swore, That I no more the Ground would Till and Sow, Where only flowry Weeds instead of Corn did grow. 3. When (see the subtil ways which Fate does find, Rebellious man to bind, Just to the work for which he is assign'd) The Muse came in more chearful than before, And bad me quarrel with her now no more. Loe thy reward! look here and see, What I have made (said she) My Lover, and belov'd, my Broghil do for thee. Though thy own verse no lasting fame can give, Thou shalt at least in his for ever live. What Criticks, the great Hectors now in Wit, Who Rant and Challenge all men that have Writ, Will dare t' oppose thee when Broghil in thy defence has drawn his conquering Pen? I rose and bow'd my head, And pardon askt for all that I had said, Well satisfi'd and proud, I straight resolv'd, and solemnly I vow'd, That from her service now I ne'r would part. So strongly, large Rewards work on a grateful Heart. 4. Nothing so soon the drooping Spirits can raise As Praises from the Men, whom all men praise. 'Tis the best Cordial, and which only those Who have at home th' Ingredients can compose, A Cordial, that restores our fainting Breath, And keeps up Life even after Death. The only danger is, lest it should be Too strong a remedie: Lest, in removing cold, it should beget Too violent a heat; And into madness, turn the Lethargie. Ah! Gracious God! that I might see A time when it were dangerous for me To be o're heat with Praise! But I within me bear (alas) too great allayes. 5. 'Tis said, Apelles, when he Venus drew, Did naked Women for his pattern view, And with his powerful fancy did refine Their humane shapes into a form Divine; None who had set could her own Picture see, Or say, One part was drawn for me: So, though this nobler Painter when he writ, Was pleas'd to think it fit That my Book should before him sit, Not as a cause, but an occasion to his wit: Yet what have I to boast, or to apply To my advantage out of it, since I, Instead of my own likeness, only find The bright Idea there, of the great Writers mind? ODE. Mr. Cowley's Book presenting it self to the University Library of Oxford. Hail Learnings Pantheon! Hail the sacred Ark Where all the World of Science do's imbarque! Which ever shall withstand, and hast so long withstood, Insatiate Times devouring Flood. Hail Tree of Knowledg, thy leaves Fruit! which well Dost in the midst of Paradise arise, Oxford the Muses Paradise, From which may never Sword the blest expell. Hail Bank of all past Ages! where they lye T' inrich with interest Posterity! Hail Wits Illustrious Galaxy! Where thousand Lights into one brightness spread; Hail living University of the Dead! 2. Unconfus'd Babel of all tongues, which er'e The mighty Linguist Fame, or Time the mighty Traveler, That could speak, or this could hear. Majestick Monument and Pyramide, Where still the shapes of parted Souls abide Embalm'd in verse, exalted souls which now Enjoy those Arts they woo'd so well below, Which now all wonders plainly see, That have been, are, or are to be, In the mysterious Library, The Beatifick Bodley of the Deity. 3. Will you into your Sacred throng admit The meanest British Wit? You Gen'ral Councel of the Priests of Fame, Will you not murmur and disdain, That I place among you claim, The humblest Deacon of her train? Will you allow me th' honourable chain? The chain of Ornament which here Your noble Prisoners proudly wear; A Chain which will more pleasant seem to me Than all my own Pindarick Liberty: Will ye to bind me with those mighty names submit, Like an Apocrypha with holy Writ? What ever happy book is chained here, No other place or People need to fear; His Chain's a Pasport to go ev'ry where. 4. As when a seat in Heaven, Is to an unmalicious Sinner given, Who casting round his wondring eye, Does none but Patriarchs and Apostles there espye; Martyrs who did their lives bestow, And Saints who Martyrs liv'd below; With trembling and amazement he begins, To recollect his frailties past and sins, He doubts almost his Station there, His soul sayes to it self, How came I here? It fares no otherwise with me When I my self with conscious wonder see, Amidst this purifi'd elected Companie. With hardship they, and pain, Did to this happiness attain: No labour I, nor merits can pretend, I think Predestination only was my friend. 5. Ah, that my Author had been ty'd like me To such a place, and such a Companie! Instead of sev'ral Countries, sev'ral Men, And business which the Muses hate, He might have then improv'd that small Estate, Which nature sparingly did to him give, He might perhaps have thriven then, And setled, upon me his Child, somewhat to live. 'T had happier been for him, as well as me, For when all, (alas) is done, We Books, I mean, You Books, will prove to be The best and noblest conversation. For though some errors will get in, Like Tinctures of Original sin: Yet sure we from our Fathers wit Draw all the strength and Spirit of it: Leaving the grosser parts for conversation, As the best blood of Man's imploy'd in generation. ODE. Sitting and Drinking in the Chair, made out of the Reliques of Sir Francis Drake's Ship. [[1.]] Chear up my Mates, the wind does fairly blow, Clap on more sail and never spare; Farewell all Lands, for now we are In the wide Sea of Drink, and merrily we go. Bless me, 'tis hot! another bowl of wine, And we shall cut the Burning Line: Hey Boyes! she scuds away, and by my head I know, We round the World are sailing now. What dull men are those who tarry at home, When abroad they might wantonly rome, And gain such experience, and spy too Such Countries, and Wonders as I do? But prythee good Pilot take heed what you do, And fail not to touch at Peru; With Gold, there the Vessel we'll store, And never, and never be poor, No never be poor any more. 2. What do I mean? What thoughts do me misguide? As well upon a staff may Witches ride Their fancy'd Journies in the Ayr, As I sail round the Ocean in this Chair: 'Tis true; but yet this Chair which here you see, For all its quiet now, and gravitie, Has wandred, and has travailed more, Than ever Beast, or Fish, or Bird, or ever Tree before. In every Ayr, and every Sea't has been, 'T has compas'd all the Earth, and all the Heavens 't has seen. Let not the Pope's it self with this compare, This is the only Universal Chair. 3. The pious Wandrers Fleet, sav'd from the flame, (Which still the Reliques did of Troy persue, And took them for its due) A squadron of immortal Nymphs became: Still with their Arms they row about the Seas, And still make new and greater voyages; Nor has the first Poetick Ship of Greece, (Though now a star she so Triumphant show, And guide her sailing Successors below, Bright as her ancient freight the shining fleece;) Yet to this day a quiet harbour found, The tide of Heaven still carries her around. Only Drakes Sacred vessel which before Had done, and had seen more, Than those have done or seen, Ev'n since they Goddesses, and this a Star has been; As a reward for all her labour past, Is made the seat of rest at last. Let the case now quite alter'd be, And as thou went'st abroad the World to see; Let the World now come to see thee. 4. The World will do't; for Curiosity Does no less than devotion, Pilgrims make; And I my self who now love quiet too, As much almost as any Chair can do, Would yet a journey take, An old wheel of that Chariot to see, Which Phaeton so rashly brake: Yet what could that say more than these remains of Drake? Great Relique! thou too, in this Port of ease, Hast still one way of Making Voyages; The breath of fame, like an auspicious Gale, (The great Trade-wind which ne're does fail,) Shall drive thee round the World, and thou shalt run, As long around it as the Sun. The straights of time too narrow are for thee, Lanch forth into an indiscovered Sea, And steer the endless course of vast Eternitie, Take for thy Sail this Verse, and for thy Pilot Mee. Upon the Death of the Earl of Balcarres. 1. Tis folly all, that can be said By living Mortals of th' immortal dead, And I'm afraid they laugh at the vain tears we shed. 'Tis, as if we, who stay behind In Expectation of the wind Should pity those, who pass'd this strait before, And touch the universal shore. Ah happy Man, who art to sail no more! And, if it seem ridiculous to grieve Because our Friends are newly come from Sea, Though ne're so fair and calm it be; What would all sober men believe If they should hear us sighing say: Balcarres, who but th' other day Did all our Love and our respect command, At whose great parts we all amaz'd did stand, Is from a storm, alass! cast suddenly on land? 2. If you will say: Few persons upon Earth Did more then he, deserve to have A life exempt from fortune and the grave; Whether you look upon his Birth, And Ancestors, whose fame's so widely spred, But Ancestors alas, who long ago are dead! Or whither you consider more The vast increase, as sure you ought, Of honor by his Labour bought, And added to the former store. All I can answer, is, that I allow The priviledge you plead for; and avow That, as he well deserv'd, he doth injoy it now. 3. Though God for great and righteous ends, Which his unerring Providence intends, Erroneous mankind should not understand, Would not permit Balcarres hand, That once with so much industry and art Had clos'd the gaping wounds of ev'ry part, To perfect his distracted Nations Cure, Or stop the fatal bondage, 't was t'endure; Yet for his pains he soon did him remove From all th' oppression and the woe Of his frail Bodies Native Soil below, To his Souls true and peaceful Count'ry above: So God, like Kings, for secret causes known Sometimes, but to themselves alone, One of their ablest Ministers elect, And send abroad to Treaties, which th' intend Shall never take effect. But, though the Treaty wants a happy end, The happy agent wants not the reward, For which he Labour'd faithfully and hard; His just and righteous Master calls him home, And gives him near himself some honourable room. 4. Noble and great endeavours did he bring To save his Country and restore his King; And whilst the Manly half of him, which those, Who know not Love, to be the whole suppose; Perform'd all parts of Virtues vigorous Life; The beauteous half his lovely Wife Did all his Labors and his cares divide; Nor was a lame, nor paralitick side. In all the turnes of human state, And all th' unjust attacques of fate She bore her share and portion still, And would not suffer any to be ill. Unfortunate for ever let me be, If I believe that such was he, Whom, in the storms of bad success, And all that error calls unhappiness, His virtue, and his virtuous Wife did still accompany. 5. With these companions 't was not strange That nothing could his temper change. His own and Countries union had not weight Enough to crush his mighty mind. He saw around the Hurricans of State, Fixt as an Island 'gainst the waves and wind. Thus far the greedy Sea may reach, All outward things are but the [beach]; A great Mans Soul it doth assault in vain. Their God himself the Ocean doth restrain With an imperceptible chain, And bid it to go back again: His Wisdom, Justice, and his Piety, His Courage both to suffer and to die, His Virtues and his Lady too Were things Celestial. And we see In spight of quarrelling Philosophie, How in this case 'tis certain found, That Heav'n stands still, and only Earth goes round. ODE. Upon Dr. Harvey. 1. Coy Nature, (which remain'd, though aged grown, A Beauteous virgin still, injoy'd by none, Nor seen unveil'd by any one) When Harveys violent passion she did see, Began to tremble, and to flee, Took Sanctuary like Daphne in a tree: There Daphnes lover stop't, and thought it much The very Leaves of her to touch, But Harvey our Apollo, stopt not so, Into the Bark, and root he after her did goe: No smallest Fibres of a Plant, For which the eiebeams Point doth sharpness want, His passage after her withstood. What should she do? through all the moving wood Of Lives indow'd with sense she took her flight, Harvey persues, and keeps her still in sight. But as the Deer long-hunted takes a flood, She leap't at last into the winding streams of blood; Of mans Meander all the Purple reaches made, Till at the heart she stay'd, Where turning head, and at a Bay, Thus, by well-purged ears, was she o're-heard to say. 2. Here sure shall I be safe (said she) None will be able sure to see This my retreat, but only He Who made both it and me. The heart of Man, what Art can e're reveal? A wall impervious between Divides the very Parts within, And doth the Heart of man ev'n from its self conceal. She spoke, but e're she was aware, Harvey was with her there, And held this slippery Proteus in a chain, Till all her mighty Mysteries she descry'd, Which from his wit the attempt before to hide Was the first Thing that Nature did in vain. 3. He the young Practise of New life did see, Whil'st to conceal its toilsome Poverty, It for a living wrought, both hard, and privately. Before the Liver understood The noble Scarlet Dye of Blood, Before one drop was by it made, Or brought into it, to set up the Trade; Before the untaught Heart began to beat The tuneful March to vital Heat, From all the Souls that living Buildings rear, Whether imply'd for Earth, or Sea, or Air, Whether it in the Womb or Egg be wrought, A strict account to him is hourly brought, How the Great Fabrick does proceed, What time and what materials it does need. He so exactly does the work survey, As if he hir'd the workers by the day. 4. Thus Harvey sought for Truth in Truth's own Book The Creatures, which by God himself was writ; And wisely thought 'twas fit, Not to read Comments only upon it, But on th'original it self to look. Methinks in Arts great Circle others stand Lock't up together, Hand in Hand, Every one leads as he is led, The same bare path they tread, A Dance like Fairies a Fantastick round, But neither change their motion, nor their ground: Had Harvey to this Road confin'd his wit, His noble Circle of the Blood, had been untroden yet. Great Doctor! Th' Art of Curing's cur'd by thee, We now thy patient Physick see, From all inveterate diseases free, Purg'd of old errors by thy care, New dieted, put forth to clearer air, It now will strong and healthful prove, It self before Lethargick lay, and could not move. 5. These useful secrets to his Pen we owe, And thousands more 'twas ready to bestow; Of which a barb'rous Wars unlearned Rage Has robb'd the ruin'd age; O cruel loss! as if the Golden Fleece, With so much cost, and labour bought, And from a far by a Great Heroe brought Had sunk ev'n in the Ports of Greece. O cursed Warr! who can forgive thee this? Houses and Towns may rise again, And ten times easier it is To rebuild Pauls, than any work of his. That mighty Task none but himself can do, Nay, scarce himself too now, For though his Wit the force of Age withstand, His Body alas! and Time it must command, And Nature now, so long by him surpass't, Will sure have her revenge on him at last. ODE. Acme and Septimius out of Catullus. Acmen Septimius suos amores Tenens in gremio, &amp;c. Whilst on Septimius panting Brest, (Meaning nothing less then Rest) Acme lean'd her loving head, Thus the pleas'd Septimius said. My dearest Acme, if I be Once alive, and love not thee With a Passion far above All that e're was called Love, In a Lybian desert may I become some Lions prey, Let him, Acme, let him tear My Brest, when Acme is not there. The God of Love who stood to hear him, (The God of Love was always near him) Pleas'd and tickl'd with the sound, Sneez'd aloud, and all around The little Loves that waited by, Bow'd and blest the Augurie. Acme enflam'd with what he said, Rear'd her gently-bending head, And her purple mouth with joy Stretching to the delicious Boy Twice (and twice could scarce suffice) She kist his drunken, rowling eyes. My little Life, my All (said she) So may we ever servants be To this best God, and ne'r retain Our hated Liberty again, So may thy passion last for me, As I a passion have for thee, Greater and fiercer much then can Be conceiv'd by Thee a Man. Into my Marrow is it gone, Fixt and setled in the Bone, It reigns not only in my Heart, But runs, like Life, through ev'ry part. She spoke; the God of Love aloud, Sneez'd again, and all the crowd Of little Loves that waited by, Bow'd and blest the Augurie. This good Omen thus from Heaven Like a happy signal given, Their Loves and Lives (all four) embrace, And hand in hand run all the race. To poor Septimius (who did now Nothing else but Acme grow) Acme's bosome was alone, The whole worlds Imperial Throne, And to faithful Acmes mind Septimius was all Human kind. If the Gods would please to be But advis'd for once by me, I'de advise 'em when they spie, Any illustrious Piety, To reward Her, if it be she; To reward Him, if it be He; With such a Husband, such a Wife, With Acme's and Septimius' Life. ODE. Upon His Majesties Restoration and Return. Virgil.—Quod optanti Divûm promittere nemo Auderet, volvenda dies, en, attulit ultro. 1. Now Blessings on you all, ye peaceful Starrs, Which meet at last so kindly, and dispence Your universal gentle Influence, To calm the stormy World, and still the rage of Warrs. Nor whilst around the Continent, Plenipotentiary Beams ye sent, Did your Pacifick Lights disdain, In their large Treaty to contain The world apart, o're which do raign Your seven fair Brethren of Great Charls his Wane; No Star amon[g]st ye all did, I believe, Such vigorous assistance give, As that which thirty years ago, At The Star that appeared at Noon, the day of the Kings Birth, just as the King His Father was riding to St. Pauls to give thanks to God for that Blessing. Charls his Birth, did, in despight Of the proud Sun's Meridian Light, His future Glories, and this Year foreshow, No less effects than these we may Be assur'd of from that powerful Ray, Which could out-face the Sun, and overcome the Day. 2. Auspicious Star again arise, And take thy Noon-tide station in the skies, Again all Heaven prodigiously adorn; For loe! thy Charls again is Born. He then was Born with and to pain: With, and to Joy he's born again. And wisely for this second Birth, By which thou certain wert to bless The Land with full and flourishing Happiness Thou mad'st of that fair Month thy choice, In which Heaven, Air, and Sea, and Earth, And all that's in them all does smile, and does rejoyce. 'Twas a right Season, and the very Ground Ought with a face of Paradise to be found, Th[e]n when we were to entertain Felicity and Innocence again. 3. Shall we again (good Heaven!) that Blessed pair behold, Which the abused People fondly sold For the bright Fruit of the forbidden Tree, By seeking all like gods to be? Will Peace her Halcyon Nest venture to build Upon a Shore with Shipwracks fill'd? And trust that Sea, where she can hardly say, Sh'has known these twenty years one calmy day, Ah! mild and gaulless Dove, Which dost the pure and candid Dwellings love: Canst thou in Albion still delight? Still canst thou think it white? Will ever fair Religion appear In these deformed Ruins? will she clear Th'Augæan Stables of her Churches here? Will Justice hazard to be seen Where a High Court of Justice e're has been? Will not the Tragique Scene, And Bradshaw's bloody Ghost affright her there, Her who shall never fear? Then may White-hall for Charles his Seat be fit. If Justice shall endure at Westminster to sit. 4. Of all, methinks, we least should see The chearful looks again of Liberty. That Name of Cromwell, which does freshly still The Curses of so many sufferers fill, Is still enough to make her stay, And jealous for a while remain, Lest as a Tempest carried him away, Some Hurican should bring him back again. Or she might justlier be afraid Lest that great Serpent, which was all a Tail, (And in his poys'nous folds whole Nations Pris'ners made) Should a third time perhaps prevail To joyn again, and with worse sting arise, As it had done, when cut in pieces twice. Return, return, ye Sacred Four, And dread your perisht Enemies no more, Your fears are causeless all, and vain Whilst you return in Charles his train, For God does Him, that He might You restore, Nor shall the world him only call, Defender of the Faith, but of ye All. 5. Along with you Plenty and Riches go With a full Tide to every Port they flow, With a warm fruitful wind o're all the Countrey blow. Honour does as ye march her Trumpet sound, The Arts encompass you around, And against all Alarms of Fear, Safety it self brings up the Rear. And in the head of this Angelique band, Lo, how the Goodly Prince at last does stand (O righteous God!) on his own happy Land. 'Tis Happy now, which could, with so much ease Recover from so desperate a Disease, A various complicated Ill, Whose every Symptome was enough to kill, In which one part of Three Frenzey possest, And Lethargy the rest. 'Tis Happy, which no Bleeding does indure A Surfet of such Blood to cure. 'Tis Happy, which beholds the Flame In which by hostile hands it ought, to burn, Or that which if from Heaven it came It did but well deserve, all into Bonfire turn. 6. We fear'd (and almost toucht the black degree Of instant Expectation) That the three dreadful Angels we Of Famine, Sword and Plague should here establisht see; (God's great Triumvirate of Desolation) To scourge and to destroy the sinful Nation. Justly might Heav'n Protectors such as those, And such Committees for their Safety impose, Upon a Land which scarsely Better chose. We fear'd that the Fanatique war Which men against God's houses did declare, Would from th'Almighty Enemy bring down A sure destruction on our Own. We read th' Instructive Histories which tell Of all those endless mischiefs that befell, The Sacred Town which God had lov'd so well, After that fatal Curse had once been said, His Blood be upon ours, and on our Childrens head. We knew, though there a greater Blood was spilt, 'Twas scarcely done with greater Guilt. We know those miseries did befall Whilst they rebell'd against that Prince whom all The rest of Mankind did the Love, and Joy, of Mankind call. 7. Already was the shaken Nation Into a wild and deform'd Chaos brought And it was hasting on (we thought) Even to the last of [Ills,] Annihilation. When in the midst of this confused Night, Loe, the blest Spirit mov'd, and there was Light. For in the glorious General's previous Ray, We saw a new created Day. We by it saw, though yet in Mists it shone, The beauteous Work of Order moving on. Where are the men who bragg'd that God did bless, And with the marks of good success Signe his allowance of their wickedness? Vain men! who thought the Divine Power to find In the fierce Thunder and the violent Wind: God came not till the storm was past, In the still voice of Peace he came at last. 'The cruel business of Destruction, May by the Claws of the great Fiend be done. Here, here we see th' Almighty's hand indeed, Both by the Beauty of the Work, we see't, and by the Speed. 8. He who had seen the noble British Heir, Even in that ill disadvantageous Light, With which [misfortune] strives t'abuse our sight; He who had seen him in his Clowd so bright: He who had seen the double Pair Of Brothers heavenly good, and Sisters heavenly fair, Might have perceiv'd (me thinks) with ease, (But wicked men see only what they please) That God had no intent t'extinguish quite The pious King's eclipsed Right. He who had seen how by the power Divine All the young Branches of this Royal Line Did in their fire without consuming shine, How through a rough Red sea they had been led, By Wonders guarded, and by Wonders fed. How many years of trouble and distress They'd wandred in their fatal Wilderness, And yet did never murmure or repine; Might (me-thinks) plainly understand, That after all these conquer'd Trials past, Th'Almighty Mercy would at last Conduct them with a strong un-erring hand To their own promis'd Land. For all the glories of the Earth Ought to be entail'd by right of Birth And all Heaven's blessings to come down Upon his Race, to whom alone was given The double Royalty of Earth and Heaven, Who crown'd the Kingly with the Martyrs Crown. 9. The Martyr's blood was said of old to be The seed from whence the Church did grow. The Royal Blood which dying Charles did sow Becomes no less the seed of Royalty. 'Twas in dishonour sown, We find it now in glory grown, The grave could but the dross of it devour; 'Twas sown in weakness, and 'tis rais'd in power. We now the Question well decided see, Which Eastern Wits did once contest At the Great Monarch's Feast Of all on earth what things the strongest be: And some for Women, some for Wine did plead; That is, for Folly and for Rage, Two things which we have known indeed Strong in this latter Age. But as 'tis prov'd by Heaven at length, The King and Truth have greatest strength, When they their sacred force unite, And twine into one Right, No frantick Common-wealths or Tyrannies, No Cheats, and Perjuries, and Lies, No Nets of humane Policies; No stores of Arms or Gold (though you could joyn Those of Peru to the great London Mine) No Towns, no Fleets by Sea, or Troops by Land, No deeply entrencht Islands can withstand, Or any small resistance bring Against the naked Truth, and the unarmed King. 10. The foolish Lights which Travellers beguile, End the same night when they begin; No Art so far can upon Nature win As e're to put out Stars, or long keep Meteors in. Wher's now that Ignis Fatuus which e're while Mis-lead our wandring Isle? Wher's the Imposter Cromwel gon? Where's now that Falling-star his Son? Where's the large Comet now whose raging flame So fatal to our Monarchy became? Which o're our heads in such proud horror stood, Insatiate with our Ruine and our Blood? The fiery Tail did to vast length extend; And twice for want of Fuel did expire, And twice renew'd the dismal Fire; Though long the Tayl we saw at last its end. The flames of one triumphant day, Which like an Anti-Comet here Did fatally to that appear, For ever frighted it away; Then did th'allotted hour of dawning Right First strike our ravisht sight Which Malice or which Art no more could stay, Than Witches Charms can a retardment bring To the Resuscitation of the Day, Or Resurrection of the Spring. We welcome both, and with improv'd delight Bless the preceding Winter and the Night. 11. Man ought his future Happiness to fear, If he be always Happy here He wants the bleeding Mark of Grace, The Circumcision of the chosen race. If no one part of him supplies The duty of a Sacrifice, He is (we doubt) reserv'd intire As a whole Victime for the Fire. Besides even in this World below, To those who never did ill Fortune know, The good does nauseous or insipid grow. Consider man's whole Life, and you'l confess, The sharp Ingredient of some bad success Is that which gives the taste to all his Happiness. But the true Method of Felicity, Is when the worst Of humane Life is plac'd the first, And when the Childs Correction proves to be The cause of perfecting the Man Let our weak Dayes lead up the Van, Let the brave Second and Triarian Band, Firm against all impression stand; The first we may defeated see; The Virtue and the Force of these, are sure of Victory. 12. Such are the years (great Charles) which now we see Begin their glorious March with Thee: Long may their March to Heaven, and still Triumphant be. Now thou art gotten once before, Ill Fortune never shall o're-take thee more. To see't again, and pleasure in it find, Cast a disdainful look behind, Things which offend, when present, and affright, In Memory, well painted, move delight. Enjoy then all thy affictions now; Thy Royal Father's came at last: Thy Martyrdom's already past. And different Crowns to both ye owe. No gold did e're the Kingly Temples bind, Than thine more try'd and more refin'd. As a choise Medal for Heaven's Treasury God did stamp first upon one side of Thee The Image of his suffering Humanity: On th' other side, turn'd now to sight, does shine The glorious Image of his Power Divine. 13. So when the wisest Poets seek In all their liveliest colours to set forth A Picture of Heroick worth, (The Pious Trojan, or the Prudent Greek) They chuse some comely Prince of heavenly Birth, (No proud Gigantick son of Earth, Who strives t' usurp the god's forbidden seat) They feed him not with Nectar, and the Meat That cannot without Joy be eat. But in the cold of want, and storms of adverse chance, They harden his young Virtue by degrees; The beauteous Drop first into Ice does freez, And into solid Chrystal next advance. His murdered friends and kindred he does see, And from his flaming Country flee. Much is he tost at Sea, and much at Land, Does long the force of angry gods withstand. He does long troubles and long wars sustain, E're he his fatal Birth-right gain. With no less time or labour can Destiny build up such a Man, Who's with sufficient virtue fill'd His ruin'd Country to rebuild. 14. Nor without cause are Arms from Heaven, To such a Hero by the Poets given. No human Metal is of force t' oppose So many and so violent blows. Such was the Helmet, Breast-plate, Shield, Which Charles in all Attaques did wield: And all the Weapons Malice e're could try, Of all the several makes of wicked Policy, Against this Armour struck, but at the stroke, Like Swords of Ice, in thousand pieces broke. To Angels and their Brethren Spirits above, No show on Earth can sure so pleasant prove, As when they great misfortunes see With Courage born and Decency. So were they born when Worc'ster's dismal Day Did all the terrors of black Fate display. So were they born when no Disguises clowd His inward Royalty could shrowd, And one of th' Angels whom just God did send To guard him in his noble flight, (A Troop of Angels did him then attend) Assur'd me in a Vision th' other night, That He (and who could better judge than He?) Did then more Greatnesse in him see, More Lustre and more Majesty, Than all his Coronation Pomp can shew to Human Eye. 15. Him and his Royal Brothers when I saw New marks of honour and of glory, From their affronts and sufferings draw, And look like Heavenly Saints even in their Purgatory; Me-thoughts I saw the three Judæan Youths, (Three unhurt Martyrs for the Noblest Truths) In the Chaldæan Furnace walk; How chearfully and unconcern'd they talk! No hair is sindg'd, no smallest beauty blasted; Like painted Lamps they shine unwasted. The greedy fire it self dares not be fed With the blest Oyl of an Anointed Head. The honourable Flame (Which rather Light we ought to name) Does, like a [G]lory compass them around, And their whole Body's crown'd. What are those Two Bright Creatures which we see Walk with the Royal Three In the same Ordeal fire, And mutual Joyes inspire? Sure they the beauteous Sisters are, Who whilst they seek to bear their share, Will suffer no affiction to be there. Less favour to those Three of old was shown, To solace with their company, The fiery Trials of Adversity; Two Angels joyn with these, the others had but One. 16. Come forth, come forth, ye men of God belov'd, And let the power now of that flame, Which against you so impotent became, On all your Enemies be proved. Come, mighty Charls, desire of Nations, come; Come, you triumphant Exile, home. He's come, he's safe at shore; I hear the noise Of a whole Land which does at once rejoyce, I hear th' united People's sacred voice. The Sea which circles us around, Ne're sent to Land so loud a sound; The mighty shout sends to the Sea a Gale, And swells up every sail; The Bells and Guns are scarcely heard at all; The Artificial Joy's drown'd by the Natural. All England but one Bonefire seems to be, One Ætna shooting flames into the Sea. The Starry Worlds which shine to us afar, Take ours at this time for a Star. With Wine all rooms, with Wine the Conduits flow; And We, the Priests of a Poetick rage, Wonder that in this Golden Age The Rivers too should not do so. There is no Stoick sure who would not now, Even some Excess allow; And grant that one wild fit of chearful folly Should end our twenty years of dismal Melancholy. 17. Where's now the Royal Mother, where, To take her mighty share In this so ravishing sight, And with the part she takes to add to the Delight? Ah! Why art Thou not here, Thou always Best, and now the Happiest Queen, To see our Joy, and with new Joy be seen? God has a bright Example made of Thee, To shew that Woman-kind may be Above that Sex, which her Superiour seems, In wisely managing the wide Extreams Of great Affliction, great Felicity. How well those different Virtues Thee become, Daughter of Triumphs, Wife of Martyrdom! Thy Princely Mind with so much Courage bore Affliction, that it dares return no more; With so much Goodness us'd Felicity, That it cannot refrain from coming back to Thee; 'Tis come, and seen to day in all it's Bravery. 18. Who's that Heroick Person leads it on, And gives it like a glorious Bride (Richly adorn'd with Nuptial Pride) Into the hands now of thy Son? 'Tis the good General, the Man of Praise, Whom God at last in gracious pitty Did to th' enthrall'd Nation raise, Their great Zerubbabel to be, To loose the Bonds of long Captivity, And to rebuild their Temple and their City. For ever blest may He and His remain, Who, with a vast, though less-appearing gain, Preferr'd the solid Great above the Vain, And to the world this Princely Truth has shown, That more 'tis to Restore, than to Usurp a Crown. Thou worthiest Person of the Brittish Story, (Though 'tis not small the Brittish glory) Did I not know my humble Verse must be But ill-proportion'd to the Heighth of Thee, Thou, and the World should see, How much my Muse, the Foe of Flattery, Do's make true Praise her Labour and Design; An Iliad or an Æneid should be Thine. 19. And ill should We deserve this happy day, If no acknowledgments we pay To you, great Patriots, of the Two Most truly Other Houses now, Who have redeem'd from hatred and from shame A Parliaments once venerable name; And now the Title of a House restore, To that, which was but slaughter-house before. If my advice, ye Worthies, might be ta'ne, Within those reverend places, Which now your living presence graces, Your Marble-Statues alwayes should remain, To keep alive your useful Memory, And to your Successors th' Example be Of Truth, Religion, Reason, Loyalty. For though a firmly setled Peace May shortly make your publick labours cease, The grateful Nation will with joy consent, That in this sense you should be said, (Though yet the Name sounds with some dread) To be the Long, the Endless Parliament. On the Queens Repairing Somerset House. When God (the Cause to Me and Men unknown) Forsook the Royal Houses, and his Own, And both abandon'd to the Common Foe; How near to ruine did my Glories go? Nothing remain'd t' adorn this Princely place Which Covetous hands could Take, or Rude Deface. In all my rooms and galleries I found The richest Figures torn, and all around Dismembred Statues of great Heroes lay; Such Naseby's Field seem'd on the fatal Day. And Me, when nought for Robbery was left, They starv'd to death; the gasping walls were cleft, The Pillars sunk, the Roofs above me wept, No sign of Spring, or Joy, my Garden kept, Nothing was seen which could content the Eye, Till Dead the impious Tyrant Here did lye. See how my face is chang'd, and what I am Since my true Mistress, and now Foundress, came. It does not fill her Bounty to restore Me as I was (nor was I small) before. She imitates the Kindness to Her shown; She does, like Heaven (which the dejected Throne At once restores, fixes, and higher rears.) Strengthen, Enlarge, Exalt what she Repairs. And now I dare (though proud I must not be, Whil'st my great Mistress I so Humble see In all her various Glories) now I dare Ev'n with the proudest Palaces compare, My Beauty, and Convenience will (I'm sure) So just a boast with Modesty endure. And all must to me yield, when I shall tell, How I am plac'd, and Who does in me dwell. Before my Gate a Street's broad Channel goes, Which still with Waves of crowding people flows, And every day there passes by my side, Up to its Western Reach, the London Tide, The Spring-Tides of the Term; my Front looks down On all the Pride, and Business of the Town. My other Front (for as in Kings we see The liveliest Image of the Deity, We in their Houses should Heaven's likeness find, Where nothing can be said to be Behind) My other fair and more Majestick Face (Who can the Fair to more advantage place?) For ever gazes on it self below In the best Mirrour that the world can show. And here, Behold, in a long bending row, How two joynt Cities make one glorious Bow, The Midst, the noblest place, possess'd by Me; Best to be Seen by all, and all O'resee. Which way soe'r I turn my joyful Eye, Here the Great Court, there the rich Town, I spy; On either side dwells Safety and Delight; Wealth on the Left, and Power upon the Right. T' assure yet my defence, on either hand, Like mighty Forts, in equal distance stand Two of the best and stateliest piles, which e're Man's liberal Piety of old did rear, Where the two Princes of th' Apostles Band, My Neighbours and my Guards, watch and command. My warlike Guard of Ships, which farther lye, Might be my Object too, were not the Eye Stopt by the Houses of that wondrous Street Which rides o're the broad River, like a Fleet. The Stream's eternal Siege they fixt abide, And the swoln Stream's Auxiliary Tide, Though both their ruine with joynt power conspire, Both to out-brave, they nothing dread but Fire. And here my Thames, though it more gentle be Than any Flood, so strength'ned by the Sea, Finding by Art his Natural forces broke, And bearing, Captive-like, the Arched Yoke, Do's roar, and foam, and rage at the disgrace, But recomposes strait and calms his Face, Is into reverence and submission strook, As soon as from afar he does but look Tow'rds the White Palace where that King does reign Who lays his Laws and Bridges o're the Main. Amidst these lowder Honours of my Seat, And two vast Cities, troublesomly Great, In a large various plain the Country too Opens her gentler blessings to my View, In me the Active and the Quiet Mind By different wayes equal content may find. If any prouder Vertuoso's sence At that part of my Prospect take offence, By which the meaner Cabanes are descri'd, Of my Imperial River's humbler side, If they call that a Blemish, let them know, God, and my God-like Mistress, think not so; For the distrest and the afflicted lye Most in their Care, and always in their Eye. And thou, fair River, who still pay'st to Me Just Homage, in thy passage to the Sea, Take here this one Instruction as thou goest; When thy mixt Waves shall visit every Coast, When round the world their Voyage they shall make, And back to Thee some secret Channels take, Ask them what nobler sight they e're did meet Except thy mighty Master's Soveraign Fleet, Which now triumphant o're the Main does ride, The Terror of all Lands, the Ocean's Pride. From hence his Kingdom's Happy now at last, (Happy, if Wise by their Misfortunes past) From hence may Omens take of that success Which both their future Wars and Peace shall bless: The Peaceful Mother on mild Thames does build, With her Son's Fabricks the rough Sea is fill'd. The Complaint. 1. In a deep Vision's intellectual scene, Beneath a Bow'r for sorrow made, Th' uncomfortable shade, Of the black Yew's unlucky green, Mixt with the mourning Willow's careful gray, Where Reverend Cham cuts out his Famous way, The Melancholy Cowley lay: And Lo! a Muse appear'd to' his closed sight, (The Muses oft in Lands of Vision play) Bodied, arrayed, and seen, by an internal Light, A golden Harp, with silver strings she bore, A wondrous Hieroglyphick Robe she wore, In which all Colours, and all figures were, That Nature or that Fancy can create, That Art can never imitate; And with loose Pride it wanton'd in the Air. In such a Dress, in such a well-cloath'd Dream, She us'd, of old, near fair Ismenus Stream, Pindar her Theban Favourite to meet; A Crown was on her Head, and wings were on her Feet. 2. She touch'd him with her Harp, and rais'd him from the Ground; The shaken strings Melodiously Resound. Art thou return'd at last, said she, To this forsaken place and me? Thou Prodigal, who didst so loosely waste Of all thy Youthful years, the good Estate; Art thou return'd here, to repent too late? And gather husks of Learning up at last, Now the rich harvest time of Life is past, And Winter marches on so fast? But, when I meant t' adopt Thee for my Son, And did as learn'd a Portion assign, As ever any of the mighty Nine Had to their dearest Children done; When I resolv'd t' exalt thy' anointed Name, Among the Spiritual Lords of peaceful Fame; Thou Changling, thou, bewitcht with noise and show, Wouldst into Courts and Cities from me go; Wouldst see the World abroad, and have a share In all the follies, and the Tumults there, Thou would'st, forsooth, be something in a State, And business thou would'st find, and would'st Create: Business! the frivolous pretence Of humane Lusts to shake off Innocence; Business! the grave impertinence: Business! the thing which I of all things hate, Business! the contradiction of thy Fate. 3. Go, Renegado, cast up thy Account, And see to what Amount Thy foolish gains by quitting me: The sale of Knowledge, Fame, and Liberty, The fruits of thy unlearn'd Apostacy, Thou thought'st if once the publick storm were past, All thy remaining Life should sun-shine be: Behold the publick storm is spent at last, The Sovereign is tost at Sea no more, And thou, with all the Noble Company, Art got at last to shore. But whilst thy fellow Voyagers, I see All marcht up to possess the promis'd Land, Thou still alone (alas) dost gaping stand, Upon the naked Beach, upon the Barren Sand. 4. As a fair morning of the blessed spring, After a tedious stormy night; Such was the glorious entry of our King, Enriching moysture drop'd on every thing: Plenty he sow'd below, and cast about him light. But then (alas) to thee alone, One of Old Gideons Miracles was shown, For every Tree, and every Herb around, With Pearly dew was crown'd, And upon all the quickned ground, The fruitful seed of Heaven did brooding lye, And nothing but the Muses Fleece was dry. It did all other Threats surpass, When God to his own People said, (The Men whom through long wandrings he had led) That he would give them ev'n a Heaven of Brass: They look'd up to that Heaven in vain, That Bounteous Heaven, which God did not restrain, Upon the most unjust to Shine and Rain. 5. The Rachel, for which twice seven years and more, Thou didst with Faith and Labour serve, And didst (if Faith and labour can) deserve, Though she contracted was to thee, Giv'n to another thou didst see, Giv'n to another who had store Of fairer, and of Richer Wives before, And not a Leah left, thy recompence to be. Go on, twice seven years more, thy fortune try, Twice seven years more, God in his bounty may Give thee, to fling away Into the Courts deceitful Lottery. But think how likely 'tis, that thou With the dull work of thy unweildy Plough, Shouldst in a hard and Barren season thrive, Shouldst even able be to live; Thou, to whose share so little bread did fall, In the miraculous year, when Manna rain'd on all. 6. Thus spake the Muse, and spake it with a smile, That seem'd at once to pity and revile. And to her thus, raising his thoughtful head, The Melancholy Cowley said, Ah wanton foe, dost thou upbraid The Ills which thou thy self hast made? When in the Cradle, Innocent I lay, Thou, wicked Spirit, stolest me away, And my abused Soul didst bear, Into thy new-found Worlds I know not where, Thy Golden Indies in the Air; And ever since I strive in vain My ravisht freedom to regain; Still I Rebel, still thou dost Reign, Lo, still in verse against thee I complain. There is a sort of stubborn Weeds, Which, if the Earth but once, it ever breeds. No wholsom Herb can near them thrive, No useful Plant can keep alive: The foolish sports I did on thee bestow, Make all my Art and Labour fruitless now; Where once such Fairies dance, no grass doth ever grow. 7. When my new mind had no infusion known, Thou gav'st so deep a tincture of thine own, That ever since I vainly try To wash away th' inherent dye: Long work perhaps may spoil thy Colours quite, But never will reduce the Native white: To all the Ports of Honour and of Gain, I often steer my course in vain, Thy Gale comes cross, and drives me back again. Thou slack'nest all my Nerves of Industry, By making them so oft to be The tinckling strings of thy loose minstrelsie. Who ever this worlds happiness would see, Must as entirely cast off thee, As they who only Heaven desire, Do from the world retire. This was my Errour, This my gross mistake, My self a demy-votary to make. Thus with Saphira, and her Husbands fate, (A fault which I like them, am taught too late) For all that I gave up, I nothing gain, And perish for the part which I retain. 8. Teach me not then, O thou fallacious Muse, The Court, and better King t' accuse; The Heaven under which I live is fair; The fertile soil will a full Harvest bear; Thine, thine is all the Barrenness; if thou Mak'st me sit still and sing, when I should plough, When I but think, how many a tedious year Our patient Soveraign did attend His long misfortunes fatal end; How chearfully, and how exempt from fear, On the Great Soveraigns Will he did depend: I ought to be accurst, if I refuse To wait on his, O thou fallacious Muse! Kings have long hands (they say) and though I be So distant, they may reach at length to me. However, of all Princes thou Shouldst not reproach Rewards for being small or slow; Thou who rewardest but with popular breath, And that too after death. The Adventures of Five hours. As when our Kings (Lords of the spacious Main) Take in just wars a rich Plate Fleet of Spain; The rude unshapen Ingots they reduce Into a form of Beauty and of use; On which the Conquerors Image now does shine, Not His whom it belong'd to in the Mine; So in the mild Contentions of the Muse (The War which Peace it self loves and persues) So have you home to us in triumph brought, This Cargazon of Spain with Treasures fraught, You have not basely gotten it by stealth, Nor by Translation borrow'd all its wealth, But by a pow'rful Spirit made it your own Metal before, Money by you 'tis grown. 'Tis currant now, by your adorning it With the fair stamp of your victorious wit: But though we praise this voyage of your Mind, And though our selves enricht by it we find, We 're not contented yet, because we know What greater stores at home within it grow; We 've seen how well you forrain Oars refine, Produce the Gold of your own Nobler Mine. The world shall then our Native plenty view, And fetch materials for their wit from you, They all shall watch the travails of your Pen, And Spain on you shall make Reprisals then. On the death of Mrs. Katherine Philips. [[1.]] Cruel disease! Ah, could it not suffice Thy old and constant spight to exercise Against the gentlest and the fairest Sex, Which still thy Depredations most do vex? Where stil thy Malice most of all (Thy Malice or thy Lust) does on the fairest fall? And in them most assault the fairest place, The Throne of Empress Beauty, ev'n the Face? There was enough of that here to asswage, (One would have thought) either thy Lust or Rage, Was't not enough, when thou, prophane Disease, Didst on this Glorious Temple seize. Was't not enough, like a wild Zealot, there, All the rich outward Ornaments to tear, Deface the innocent pride of beauteous Images? Was't not enough thus rudely to defile But thou must quite destroy the goodly Pile? And thy unbounded Sacriledge commit On th' inward Holiest Holy of her Wit? Cruel disease! There thou mistook'st thy power; No Mine of Death can that devour, On her embalmed Name it will abide An everlasting Pyramide, As high as Heav'n the top, as Earth, the Basis wide. 2. All Ages past, record, all Countreys now, In various kinds such equal Beauties show, That ev'n Judge Paris would not know On whom the Golden Apple to bestow, Though Goddesses to' his sentence did submit Women and Lovers would appeal from it: Nor durst he say, Of all the Female race, This is the Sovereign Face. And some (though these be of a kind that's Rare, That's much, ah, much less frequent then the Fair) So equally renown'd for Virtue are, That it the Mother of the Gods might pose, When the best Woman for her guide she chose. But if Apollo should design A Woman Laureat to make, Without dispute he would Orinda take, Though Sappho and the famous Nine Stood by, and did repine. To be a Princess or a Queen Is Great; but 'tis a Greatness always seen; The World did never but two Women know, Who, one by fraud, th' other by with did rise To the two tops of Spiritual Dignities, One Female Pope of old, one Female Poet now. 3. Of Female Poets who had names of old Nothing is shown, but only Told, And all we hear of them perhaps may be Male-Flatt'ry only, and Male-Poetry. Few minutes did their Beauties Lightning waste, The Thunder of their voice did longer last, But that too soon was past. The certain proofs of our Orinda's wit, In her own lasting Characters are writ, And they will long my praise of them survive, Though long perhaps too that may live. The Trade of Glory mannag'd by the Pen Though great it be, and every where is found Does bring in but small profit to us Men; 'Tis by the number of the sharers drown'd. Orinda on the Female coasts of Fame, Ingrosses all the Goods of a Poetique Name. She does no Partner with her see, Does all the business there alone, which we Are forc'd to carry on by a whole Company. 4. But Wit's like a Luxurian[t] Vine; Unless to Virtue's prop it joyn, Firm and Erect towards Heaven bound; Though it with beauteous Leaves and pleasant Fruit be crown'd, It lies deform'd, and rotting on the Ground. Now Shame and Blushes on us all, Who our own Sex Superior call! Orinda does our boasting Sex out-do, Not in Wit only, but in Virtue too. She does above our best Examples rise, In Hate of Vice, and scorn of Vanities. Never did spirit of the Manly make, And dipt all o're in Learnings Sacred Lake, A temper more Invulnerable take. No violent Passion could an entrance find, Into the tender Goodness of her Mind Through walls of Stone those furious Bullets may Force their impetuous way When her soft Brest they hit, powerless and dead they lay. 5. The Fame of Friendship which so long had told Of three or four illustrious Names of old, Till hoarse and weary with the tale she grew Rejoyces now t' have got a new, A new, and more surprizing story, Of fair Leucasias and Orindas Glory. As when a prudent Man does once perceive That in some Forrain Countrey he must live, The Language and the Manners he does strive To understand and practise here, That he may come, no stranger there So well Orinda did her self prepare In this much different Clime for her remove To the glad World of Poetry and Love. Hymn. To light. 1 First born of Chaos, who so fair didst come From the old Negro's darksome womb! Which when it saw the lovely Child, The melancholly Mass put on kind looks and smil'd, 2 Thou Tide of Glory which no Rest dost know, But ever Ebb, and ever Flow! Thou Golden shower of a true Jove! Who does in thee descend, and Heav'n to Earth make Love! 3 Hail active Natures watchful Life and Health! Her Joy, her Ornament, and Wealth! Hail to thy Husband Heat, and Thee! Thou the worlds beauteous Bride, the lusty Bridegroom He! 4 Say from what Golden Quivers of the Sky, Do all thy winged Arrows fly? Swiftness and Power by Birth are thine: From thy Great Sire they came, thy Sire the word Divine. 5 'Tis, I believe, this Archery to show, That so much cost in Colours thou, And skill in Painting dost bestow, Upon thy ancient Arms, the Gawdy Heav'nly Bow. 6 Swift as light Thoughts their empty Carriere run, Thy Race is finisht, when begun, Let a Post-Angel start with Thee, And Thou the Goal of Earth shalt reach as soon as He: 7 Thou in the Moons bright Chariot proud and gay, Dost thy bright wood of Stars survay; And all the year dost with thee bring Of thousand flowry Lights thine own Nocturnal Spring. 8 Thou Scythian-like dost round thy Lands above The Suns gilt Tent for ever move, And still as thou in pomp dost go The shining Pageants of the World attend thy show. 9 Nor amidst all these Triumphs dost thou scorn The humble Glow-worms to adorn, And with those living spangles gild, (O Greatness without Pride!) the Bushes of the Field. 10 Night, and her ugly Subjects thou dost fright, And sleep, the lazy Owl of Night; Asham'd and fearful to appear They skreen their horrid shapes with the black Hemisphere. 11 With 'em there hasts, and wildly takes the Alarm, Of painted Dreams, a busie swarm, At the first opening of thine eye, The various Clusters break, the antick Atomes fly. 12 The guilty Serpents, and obscener Beasts Creep conscious to their secret rests: Nature to thee does reverence pay, Ill Omens, and ill Sights removes out of thy way. 13 At thy appearance, Grief it self is said, To shake his Wings, and rowse his Head. And cloudy care has often took A gentle beamy Smile reflected from thy Look. 14 At thy appearance, Fear it self grows bold; Thy Sun-shine melts away his Cold. Encourag'd at the sight of Thee, To the cheek Colour comes, and firmness to the knee. 15 Even Lust the Master of a hardned Face, Blushes if thou beest in the place, To darkness' Curtains he retires, In Sympathizing Night he rowls his smoaky Fires. 16 When, Goddess, thou liftst up thy wakened Head, Out of the Mornings purple bed, Thy Quire of Birds about thee play, And all the joyful world salutes the rising day. 17 The Ghosts, and Monster Spirits, that did presume A Bodies Priv'lege to assume, Vanish again invisibly, And Bodies gain agen their visibility. 18 All the Worlds bravery that delights our Eyes Is but thy sev'ral Liveries, Thou the Rich Dy on them bestowest, Thy nimble Pencil Paints this Landskape as thou go'st. 19 A Crimson Garment in the Rose thou wear'st; A Crown of studded Gold thou bear'st, The Virgin Lillies in their White, Are clad but with the Lawn of almost Naked Light. 20 The Violet, springs little Infant, stands, Girt in thy purple Swadling-bands: On the fair Tulip thou dost dote; Thou cloath'st it in a gay and party-colour'd Coat. 21 With Flame condenst thou dost the Jewels fix, And solid Colours in it mix: Flora her self envyes to see Flowers fairer then her own, and durable as she. 22 Ah, Goddess! would thou could'st thy hand withhold, And be less Liberall to Gold; Didst thou less value to it give, Of how much care (alas) might'st thou poor Man relieve! 23 To me the Sun is more delightful farr, And all fair Dayes much fairer are. But few, ah wondrous few there be, Who do not Gold preferr, O Goddess, ev'n to Thee. 24 Through the soft wayes of Heaven, and Air, and Sea, Which open all their Pores to Thee; Like a cleer River thou dost glide, And with thy Living Stream through the close Channels slide. 25 But where firm Bodies thy free course oppose, Gently thy source the Land oreflowes; Takes there possession, and does make, Of Colours mingled, Light, a thick and standing Lake. 26 But the vast Ocean of unbounded Day In th' Empyræan Heaven does stay. Thy Rivers, Lakes, and Springs below From thence took first their Rise, thither at last must Flow. To the Royal Society. 1. Philosophy the great and only Heir Of all that Human Knowledge which has bin Unforfeited by Mans rebellious Sin, Though full of years He do appear, (Philosophy, I say, and call it, He, For whatso'ere the Painters Fancy be, It a Male-virtue seemes to me) Has still been kept in Nonage till of late, Nor manag'd or enjoy'd his vast Estate: Three or four thousand years one would have thought, To ripeness and perfection might have brought A Science so well bred and nurst, And of such hopeful parts too at the first. But, oh, the Guardians and the Tutors then, (Some negligent, and some ambitious men) Would ne're consent to set him Free, Or his own Natural Powers to let him see, Lest that should put an end to their Autoritie. 2. That his own business he might quite forget, They' amus'd him with the sports of wanton Wit, With the Desserts of Poetry they fed him, In stead of solid meats t' encrease his force; In stead of vigorous exercise they led him Into the pleasant Labyrinths of ever-fresh Discourse: In stead of carrying him to see The Riches which doe hoorded for him lie In Natures endless Treasurie, They chose his Eye to entertain (His curious but not covetous Eye) With painted Scenes, and Pageants of the Brain. Some few exalted Spirits this latter Age has shown, That labour'd to assert the Liberty (From Guardians, who were now Usurpers grown) Of this old Minor still, Captiv'd Philosophy; But 'twas Rebellion call'd to fight For such a long-oppressed Right. Bacon at last, a mighty Man, arose Whom a wise King and Nature chose Lord Chancellour of both their Lawes, And boldly undertook the injur'd Pupils cause. 3. Autority, which did a Body boast, Though 'twas but Air condens'd, and stalk'd about, Like some old Giants more Gigantic Ghost, To terrifie the Learned Rout With the plain Magick of true Reasons Light, He chac'd out of our sight, Nor suffer'd Living Men to be misled By the vain shadows of the Dead: To Graves, from whence it rose, the conquer'd Phantome fled; He broke that Monstrous God which stood In midst of th' Orchard, and the whole did claim, Which with a useless Sith of Wood, And something else not worth a name, (Both vast for shew, yet neither fit Or to Defend, or to Beget; Ridiculous and senceless Terrors!) made Children and superstitious Men afraid. The Orchard's open now, and free; Bacon has broke that Scar-crow Deitie; Come, enter, all that will, Behold the rip'ned Fruit, come gather now your Fill. Yet still, methinks, we fain would be Catching at the Forbidden Tree, We would be like the Deitie, When Truth and Falshood, Good and Evil, we Without the Sences aid within our selves would see; For 'tis God only who can find All Nature in his Mind. 4. From Words, which are but Pictures of the Thought, Though we our Thoughts from them perversly drew) To things, the Minds right Object, he it brought, Like foolish Birds to painted Grapes we flew; He sought and gather'd for our use the True; And when on heaps the chosen Bunches lay, He prest them wisely the Mechanick way, Till all their juyce did in one Vessel joyn, Ferment into a Nourishment Divine, The thirsty Souls refreshing Wine. Who to the life an exact Piece would make, Must not from others Work a Copy take; No, not from Rubens or Vandike; Much less content himself to make it like Th' Idæas and the Images which lie In his own Fancy, or his Memory. No, he before his sight must place The Natural and Living Face; The real object must command Each Judgment of his Eye, and Motion of his Hand. 5. From these and all long Errors of the way, In which our wandring Prædecessors went, And like th' old Hebrews many years did stray In Desarts but of small extent, Bacon, like Moses, led us forth at last, The barren Wilderness he past, Did on the very Border stand Of the blest promis'd Land, And from the Mountains Top of his Exalted Wit, Saw it himself, and shew'd us it. But Life did never to one Man allow Time to Discover Worlds, and Conquer too; Nor can so short a Line sufficient be To fadome the vast depths of Natures Sea: The work he did we ought t' admire, And were unjust if we should more require From his few years, divided 'twixt th' Excess Of low Affliction, and high Happiness. For who on things remote can fix his sight, That's alwayes in a Triumph, or a Fight? 6. From you, great Champions, we expect to get These spacious Countries but discover'd yet; Countries where yet in stead of Nature, we Her Images and Idols worship'd see: These large and wealthy Regions to subdue, Though Learning has whole Armies at command, Quarter'd about in every Land, A better Troop she ne're together drew. Methinks, like Gideon's little Band, God with Design has pickt out you, To do these noble Wonders by a Few: When the whole Host he saw, They are (said he) Too many to O'rcome for Me; And now he chuses out his Men, Much in the way that he did then: Not those many whom he found Idely extended on the ground, To drink with their dejected head The Stream just so as by their Mouths it fled: No, but those Few who took the waters up, And made of their laborious Hands the Cup. 7. Thus you prepar'd; and in the glorious Fight Their wondrous pattern too you take: Their old and empty Pitchers first they brake, And with their Hands then lifted up the Light. Io! Sound too the Trumpets here! Already your victorious Lights appear; New Scenes of Heaven already we espy, And Crowds of golden Worlds on high; Which from the spacious Plains of Earth and Sea; Could never yet discover'd be By Sailers or Chaldæans watchful Eye. Natures great Workes no distance can obscure, No smalness her near Objects can secure Y' have taught the curious Sight to press Into the privatest recess Of her imperceptible Littleness. Y' have learn'd to Read her smallest Hand, And well begun her deepest Sense to Understand. 8. Mischief and true Dishonour fall on those Who would to laughter or to scorn expose So Virtuous and so Noble a Design, So Human for its Use, for Knowledge so Divine. The things which these proud men despise, and call Impertinent, and vain, and small, Those smallest things of Nature let me know, Rather than all their greatest Actions Doe. Whoever would Deposed Truth advance Into the Throne usurp'd from it, Must feel at first the Blows of Ignorance, And the sharp Points of Envious Wit. So when by various turns of the Celestial Dance, In many thousand years A Star, so long unknown, appears, Though Heaven it self more beauteous by it grow, It troubles and alarms the World below, Does to the Wise a Star, to Fools a Meteor show. 9. With Courage and Success you the bold work begin; Your Cradle has not Idle bin: None e're but Hercules and you could be At five years Age worthy a History. And ne're did Fortune better yet Th' Historian to the Story fit: As you from all Old Errors free And purge the Body of Philosophy; So from all Modern Folies He Has vindicated Eloquence and Wit. His candid Stile like a clean Stream does slide, And his bright Fancy all the way Does like the Sun-shine in it play; It does like Thames, the best of Rivers, glide, Where the God does not rudely overturn, But gently pour the Crystal Urn, And with judicious hand does the whole Current Guide. T' has all the Beauties Nature can impart, And all the comely Dress without the paint of Art. Upon the Chair made out of Sir Francis Drakes ship, Presented to the University Library in Oxford, by John Davis of Deptford, Esquire. To this great Ship which round the Globe has run, And matcht in Race the Chariot of the Sun, This Pythagorean Ship (for it may claim Without presumption so deserv'd a Name, By knowledge once and transformation now) In her New Shape this sacred Port allow. Drake and his Ship could not have wish'd from Fate, A more blest Station, or more blest Estate. For (Lo!) a Seat of endless Rest is given, To her in Oxford, and to him in Heaven.</field>
