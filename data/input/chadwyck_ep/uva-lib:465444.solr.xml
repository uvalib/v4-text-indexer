      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE ALEXANDER LORD LOUGHBOROUGH, LORD HIGH CHANCELLOR OF GREAT BRITAIN, IN GRATITUDE FOR FAVOUR SPONTANEOUSLY CONFERRED, AND ENHANCED BY URBANITY AND LIBERAL CONDESCENSION, THESE POEMS ARE, WITH PERMISSION, RESPECTFULLY DEDICATED BY HIS LORDSHIP'S MOST OBEDIENT, AND OBLIGED HUMBLE SERVANT, GEORGE HUDDESFORD. March 1, 1801. SALMAGUNDI. To RICHARD WYATT, Esq. ON LEAVING HIS MANSION AFTER ASCOT RACES. ? Me ludit amabilis Insania. Hor. lib. iii. Carm. 4. Congenial to my pensive breast O'ershadowing clouds the skies invest; Fast-falling showers deform the glade, No cheering ray dispels the shade, No lark's clear carol wakes the morn That, lowering, bids my steps forlorn Abandon Surry's smiling plains, Fly the lov'd roof where Friendship reigns, Where liberal Mirth that care beguiles, And calm Contentment's heav'nly smiles Their heart-enlivening influence shed; Where Time throws off his wings of lead, And clad in purple plumage light, Speeds swifter than the winds his flight. Thence as my devious course I steer, Fancy in fairy visions clear Bids, to beguile my 'tranced eyes, Past joys in sweet succession rise: Refreshing Zephyr's balmy breath Bids me inhale where Ascot Heath, Impregnated with mild perfume, Bares its broad bosom's purple bloom: Gives to my view the splendid crowd, The high-born racer neighing loud, The manag'd steeds that, side by side, Precede the glittering chariot's pride, Within whose silken coverture Some peerless Beauty sits secure, And, fatal to the soul's repose, Around her thrilling glances throws. Enchantress, whose all-powerful spell We felt, when Warton's dulcet Shell (A choice libation at thy shrine) Pour'd the stream of Song divine, The late Dr. Warton's exquisite Ode to Fancy. O Fancy! speed with me thy flight, O'er oaks in richest verdure dight, Whose writhed limbs of giant mould Wave to the breeze their umbrage bold; Bear me, embowering shades between, Through many a glade and vista green Whence silver streams are seen to glide, And towering domes th' horizon hide, To Leonard's forest-fringed Mound; Where lavish Nature spreads around Whate'er can captivate the sight, Elysian lawns, and prospects bright As visions of expiring saints, Or scenes that Harcourt's pencil paints. The Lady of General Harcourt, of St. Leonard's Hill. Bear me where 'midst enamell'd meads Redundant Thames his bounty sheds, Teeming with many a plenteous freight: Where o'er the vale in antique state Imperial Windsor's turrets frown, And massy fanes of old renown. Give me to gaze with ardent eye On gorgeous spoils of Chivalry; To ken aloft the radiant rows Of banners won from Britain's foes; Recall the glorious deeds of yore; Shew the dark mail that Edward Edward, styled the Black Prince, from the sable armour which he wore, son of Edward the Third. wore; The falchion shew, whose thundering stroke Cressy's pale ranks impetuous broke; From whose fell glare unnerv'd with dread Gallia's aspiring chieftains fled, Or from its edge, with nobler aim, Gather'd the meed of death and fame. O Fancy! give me to pervade Chambers in pictur'd pomp array'd, Peopling whose stately walls I view The godlike forms that Raffaelle drew, Enraptur'd see his magic hand Wield the creative pencil-wand, Whose touches animation give, And bid th' insensate canvass live, Glowing with many a deed divine Achiev'd in holy Palestine. The Passions feel its potent charm, And round the mighty Master swarm: Lo! where Dismay with haggard-gaze Cartoon.—The Death of Ananias, in the Royal apartments at Windsor Castle. The death-smote Hypocrite surveys; Beholds his eyes convulsive roll, And Fate arrest his sordid soul! Lo! motionless Attention stands, Cartoon.—Paul preaching at Athens. Where to the firmament his hands Sublime the great Instructor rears! While Athens rapt in wonder hears Truth's energetic voice proclaim Her unknown God's tremendous name! Deep read in Superstition's lore, Behold capricious Zeal adore, Cartoon.—Paul and Barnabas at Lystra. In sublunary weeds array'd, The fabled Gods her fears have made! “Those pow'rful sounds,” she cries, “I know: “Hark! from the honied lips they flow “Of Maia's Son!—Can Man dispense “Activity to impotence? “Can energy of mortal hand “The shrunk, distorted limb expand? “Inveterate force of ills confound, “And bid the lame with transport bound?— “'Tis Jove's,—the unexampled deed! “To Jove th' Isaurian Steer shall bleed! “To Jove the rich libations pour! “Braid in bright wreaths each blooming flow'r, “Swell each loud strain of festive mirth, “To gratulate the Gods on earth!”— Artist supreme! by Nature taught To clothe with life each glowing thought, Too soon Raffaelle died in 1520, at the age of 37 years. the destinies conspire To quench thy pencil's hallow'd fire; Too soon the soul that warm'd thy clay Aspir'd to realms of endless day On wings of ecstasy, to join Sages and saints, a band divine, Whose godlike forms (ere death withdrew The veil that darkens mortal view) Heav'n bade thy penetrative eye Amid her dazzling courts descry; Thence bade thee trace the faultless line, Th' expressive grace, the chaste design, The mien that love and awe inspires, And wakes devotion's purest fires. Thy memory, still to genius dear, Britain's enlighten'd sons revere; And grateful hail their Monarch's name, Whose liberal care thy labours claim: To heights impervious heretofore Who bids immortal Science soar; Far seen in venerable pride, Whose regal seat, expanding wide Its portals at his high behest, Hails ev'ry Art, an honour'd guest: Beneath whose mild, auspicious reign The Genius old of Greece again, Awaken'd from his deep repose, In Reynolds' living canvass glows; Where Grace and Energy divine, With Beauty truly blent combine: And braids his deathless bays around The British Raffaelle's brows renown'd. Lo! by his daring hand pourtray'd, The Victories of Edward the Third, and Edward the Black Prince, painted by Mr. West. The sanguinary scene display'd Where martial peers, in glittering mail, Unfold their pennons to the gale; O'er Normandy's dismantled plains Where iron-clad Contention reigns; And Havoc waits (his tresses wet With gore) thy nod, Plantagenet! Wafted from Albion's Isle afar, Where wake her sons the storm of war; Where, ravish'd from the parent stem To grace the Victor's diadem, Thy Lilies, France, no more assume The splendour of their wonted bloom; No more with peerless lustre glow, But soil with blood their native snow!— Now o'er the braid from Fancy's loom The rich tints breathe a deeper gloom; While, consecrated domes beneath Midst hoary shrines and caves of death, Secluded from the eye of day She bids her pensive votary stray. Brooding o'er monumental cells There awe-diffusing Silence dwells, Save when along the lofty fane Devotion wakes her hallow'd strain, When the vast organ's breathing frame Echoes the voice of loud acclaim, And the deep diapason's sound Thunders the vaulted iles around. From the broad window's fretted height Streams the rich flood of mellow'd light, That bids the pav'd expanse below With hues of gold and crimson glow, Reflected from the gorgeous pane, Where Picture holds her lasting reign: Where, in translucent glories dight, Selestial forms arrest the sight; The enraptur'd gazer's pow'rs control, And bathe in ecstasy the soul. There, rang'd in reverend majesty, The taper shafts ascending high To decorate the crisped roof Their mingling branches shoot aloof: Where, blazon'd in projecting gold, Flame the proud crests of Barons bold. Now beams on Fancy's eye no more The spangled roof, the polish'd floor, The speaking chrystal's various stain Illumining the wondrous fane: Choirs, altars, shrines, illusive fade.— Enliv'ning Airs my sense invade: Encircled by the young and fair, The blithe Assembly's bliss I share; Swift o'er the lyre's harmonious strings His magic hand the minstrel flings; Responsive to the sprightly sound, The dancer's quivering feet rebound; Diffusing wide their silver rays, Aloft the sparkling lustres blaze; While milder emanations flow From love-enkindling orbs below. Amid the soul-subduing scene Lo! Fauconberg's majestic mien Conspicuous tow'rs above the rest: Impurpled plumes her brows invest, Amid whose trembling summits high Insidious Cupids ambush'd lie. To each enchanting Grace allied, Here Fancy bids fair Bouverie glide, Light as the breath of opening morn O'er beds of unsunn'd violets born, And win each heart, a willing prize, Unconscious of her victories. There Townshend threads the pleasing maze: Ah who can unenamour'd gaze! To fan the flame of chaste desire There Law's ingenuous charms conspire; Smiles that enthral the ravish'd sense, The speaking eye's soft eloquence, And blush, whose living roses dye The shrine of Sensibility! Who the sweet magic can withstand Of powerful Nature's lavish hand Fresh as the spring, as Hebe fair, Where Egham sends a gentle Pair, And bids the charm'd affections hail The Sister Lilies of her Vale, Two sweeter blossoms ne'er the braid Of Flora's coronet display'd. The Measures cease—her tempting stores Around prolific Fancy pours; The sumptuous board, extended wide, Her visionary viands hide: Beauty and youth the banquet share— Hence to the winds intrusive Care! Rigour unbend thy brow austere! The laughing Loves and Graces here Comus to his festive rites To mirth and genial cheer invites, And the blithe ivy-crowned Guest, Who thaws the Virgin's frozen breast With the liquid fires that glow Where his purple clusters grow. Fill'd to many a favorite name, I see the mantling nectar flame! Latent amid th' inspiring draught Speeds the blind God his subtle shaft, And while the flask his votary drains Despotic in his bosom reigns, Whence, for the Nymph his soul admires, Th' involuntary sigh expires, And languor steals through every vein.— Now to the jocund dance again, And bid the merry tabor's sound, And harp's loud-echoing chime astound The drowsy steeds that through dun air Night's ebon-axled chariot bear! With frolic measures, sport and song, Pleasure's ecstatic reign prolong, 'Till old Tithonus' Bride renews The lamp of morn, and heaven bestrews With roses, such as blushing speak Consent in Sappho's virgin-cheek: 'Till, quite extinct each glimmering star, Hyperion mounts his radiant car, And wakes the breathing flow'rs that blow With richest tints of Iris' bow; And fires old Ocean's flood, that pours His splendours round a thousand shores. Then home They hie, and, warm with wine, Still, as they press the couch supine, See fairy-visions round them float, List the soft lyre's imperfect note, Exhaust th' imaginary vase, Fair forms in faultering measures chase, Catch from bright eyes th' ecstatic beam, And of ideal transports dream. Divine Enchantress, Fancy! deign Still to prolong thy blissful reign! Frequent, to sooth my languid sense, Thy visionary balm dispense! Invest in varying colours bright Each grateful scene of past delight! Sweet dalliance let me hold with thee, Estrang'd from Sad Reality! O deign to cheer my humble cell! Thence grave Parochial Cares expel: Shield me from swathed Infants' scream, And clouds of suffocating steam, That from the Gossip's bowl exhale, Mix'd with tobacco's potent gale! From Undertakers' gloomy brows, From Overseers' important bows, From ruthless Sexton's lethal face, And Beadles bristled o'er with lace! Shield me from puritanic cant Of Faded Maids, who matins haunt, And, lowering o'er each lonely pew, At once their sins and wrinkles rue! My trembling ears, O Fancy, save From Sternhold's inharmonious stave! From the sad Brief's unpitied tale, From Exposition trite and stale, And many an opiate Inference! Shield me from sounds at strife with sense! From Pedantry of formal port, And Consequence in cassoc short! So, Goddess, thy propitious smile Shall Time's ungenial flight beguile, Wake into joy my pensive hours, And strew life's barren path with flow'rs. Nor shall the kindred Muse decline To blend her simple blooms with thine; Blest, if the wreath by Fancy wove Kind Friendship's partial voice approve; Nor sigh for unsubstantial bays If Wyatt's plaudit crown her lays. AMATORY ODES. ODE I. [Let the sons of Lucre pine] Let the sons of Lucre pine For glittering heaps of golden ore, To swell th' accumulated store Contemn the terrors of the mine; Explore the caverns dark and drear Mantled around with deadly dew; Where congregated vapours blue, Fir'd by the taper glimmering near, Bid dire explosion the deep realms invade, And earth-born light'nings gleam athwart th' infernal shade. Pride, on thy vesture's purple fold Let the sky-tinctur'd sapphire blaze, The emerald shed its milder rays, And rubies blush in circling gold: Low at thy nod let suppliants bow, And crested chiefs precedence yield; Thy hand the rod of empire wield, And wreaths of triumph grace thy brow:— A nobler aim let my ambition own, Be Love my empire, Lesbia's heart my throne! Where into rage the wint'ry blast Awakes old ocean's sullen wave Let Commerce urge her busy slave; And elevate his trembling mast Above the billowy precipice, To meet the forked lightning's flash; Then down th' adventurous vessel dash, Found'ring within the black abyss: Or let his freight secure the surges sweep, And of their prey defraud the monsters of the deep: My bark the tide of young desire, O Venus to thy happy realm Shall waft, fair Hope direct the helm, Love's sighs the swelling sails inspire: To Thee, bright offspring of the wave, I'll many an amorous vow prefer: From storms of hate thy mariner And blast of chill indifference save! So to thy pow'r I'll frame the votive lay, And moor'd in Lesbia's arms confess thy sov'reign sway. Amid ensanguin'd fields of war, Valour, be thy votary found: Where crimson banners wave around The martial clarion echoing far; In vain gigantic Terror calls His spectre shapes, a ghastly band: Nor Discord hurling high his brand, Nor Danger's horrid front, appals; Nor Death his unrelenting soul can tame, Or from his grasp withhold the glorious meed of Fame: But let me wander far away From the loud drum and neighing steed, Thro' many a pansie-painted mead, Where Isis' bright-hair'd naiads stray; High o'er my head a pendant bow'r Let the broad elm and branching pine With intermingling umbrage twine; There Love's impassion'd song I'll pour, And summon every wave that dances near, Bridling his wanton speed, my Lesbia's praise to hear. Where the pale lamp's waining eye, At ev'ning from some cloyster'd nook Casts o'er the gloom a lingering look, There let the Sage his labours ply; And many a feat of champion bold, And many a legendary rhime, Snatch from the sepulchre of time; And frequent, as the night grows old, At fear-engender'd forms recoil aghast, And hear unhallow'd ghosts wail in each hollow blast: But o'er my haunts with influence bland Let Ev'ning fling her welcome shade: Then mid the dance, O beauteous Maid! Let me thine unreluctant hand Enraptur'd seize:—or let the lyre, Obedient to thy soft control, Bind in harmonious chains my soul, And ecstasy and bliss inspire: While to the charmed ear in heav'nly strains, Enamour'd of thy touch, each trembling chord complains. Then, Fairest! let my bosom feel Thy smile's exhilarating pow'r, Grateful as, mid noon's sultry hour, The grot where trickling dews congeal: And, in the rich grape's purple tide When Joy and genial Pleasure swim, Do Thou but kiss its chrystal brim, And, to thy bard the goblet guide; So shall my song exalt thy praise above Hebe, who bids o'erflow the nectar'd cup of Jove, ODE II. [Now hath the Sun his evanescent fires] Now hath the Sun his evanescent fires Quench'd in the billows of the western main: Sequester'd brakes enshroud the feathery choirs, And shelt'ring folds th' imprison'd herds retain. Fall, ye deep shades! unhear'd ye waters roll! Spread thy dominion, Silence, o'er the grove! For Lesbia sleeps:—nor cheers my pensive soul The glance of rapture, nor the voice of love. Ye Winds, whose havoc-spreading pinions ply Their furious speed, and with dire yell invade This nether world, whose wasteful tyranny Pale Dryads mourn in many a ruin'd shade, Wake not my love!—let not your thund'ring cry With dread alarm the haunts of peace infest; Here breathe in soft Æolian melody Each cadence sweet that sooths the soul to rest. Ye Spectres (whom belated pilgrims fear, Issuing in throngs from charnel, vault, or tomb, What time deep-shadowing clouds thy radiant sphere, Cynthia! involve in night's meridian gloom,) Hence to deserted fane or mouldering hall, Or the gaunt felon's ruthless course control! With monitory shriek the wretch appal, And to compunction wake his torpid soul: But walk not near the couch where Lesbia lies Like some rich pearl in its enamell'd shell, Or sainted relick from profaner eyes Secluded in the dim shrine's silver cell. Wanton, ye Fairies! round her tranquil bower, With blissful elves fantastic measures tread; O'er her soft eyelids dews of opiate power, Cull'd from choice blooms, in show'rs of fragrance shed: Let your bright tapers' visionary ray The raven-tinctur'd robe of Night illume; And streaming o'er your spangled crests display The wave-enamour'd halcyon's emerald plume! And bid your Minstrel-Fays, a shadowy choir That charm the planets from their spheres sublime, Celestial songs, that love and joy inspire, Chaunt to their golden harps' harmonious chime! And, when morn's purple streaks th' horizon stain, And fairies fly the peal of chanticleer, Let fancy still your glittering hues retain, Still let your wild notes tremble on her ear! Then, Lesbia! wake thy beauties, fresher far Than Galatea boasted when she lav'd In the smooth deep her coral-axled car, And the stern heart of Neptune's Son enslav'd! Wake at his call, to sooth whose soul in vain Morn sheds her radiant beam, her odorous airs, Save when, attentive to his artless strain, That radiant beam, those odours, Lesbia shares. He asks no laureate wreath to deck his brows, No golden meed his bounded wishes claim: Blest if the object of his tenderest vows Smile on his lay:—for Lesbia's smile is Fame. ODE III. [Fate gave with unrelenting speed to fly] Fate gave with unrelenting speed to fly The genial hours that Love and Lesbia bless'd; Sad, on her ear I pour'd the parting sigh, Sad, on her hand the parting kiss impress'd. Nor Lesbia, generous maid, her hand withdrew, Nor did her ear disdain the parting sigh; Swift to her cheek the living crimson flew, Soft pity fill'd her breast and sympathy. There all the gentle Charities reside, With liberal sentiment, and chaste desire; And banish cold reserve, and ruthless pride, That bid affection's trembling flame expire. “Farewell the Bard,” she cried “whose grateful Muse “Bade many a vocal shade my name resound: “And, rich in Fancy's visionary hues, “With many a fairy wreath my tresses bound: “Still on those artless wreaths shall Lesbia smile, “Still shall her partial voice applaud thy lay, “Bid unexpected joy thy cares beguile, “And hope's pure radiance gild each rising day.” Ah! far from Love, from Lesbia, doom'd to fly, Cheerless and sad I trace life's gloomy scene, And faintly hope's far distant ray descry, While clouds and darkness fill the void between! The seaman thus the beacon's friendly fires Dejected views, while the black billows swell, And from the haven that his soul desires Remorseless winds his labouring bark repel. What lenitive can ease the bosom's pain, What charm the fever of the mind remove? Can Solitude, can Silence, break the chain That's forg'd by friendship, sympathy, and love? Then let me shun the day-star's glittering beam, And seek in solitary glens repose: O'er the dim margin of some nameless stream, Her pendant shade where the sad willow throws. Or trace the gloom of some sepulchral grove Where mouldering shrines a death-like stillness breathe; To all the soft anxieties of love Insensible as those that sleep beneath. Delusive hope!—say, where the solitude That to intrusive Love access denies? Say, where the hallow'd haunt whose glooms exclude Lesbia's enchanting form from Fancy's eyes?— Then bid the flood that swells the wanton vine O'erflow the lucid vase with roses crown'd; Prepare the feast—and let the God of Wine Bathe with his purple balm my amorous wound! Let the ripe cluster's animating tide Pervade with genial flow my languid frame, Till Passion's sad solicitudes subside, Till fades, all pow'rful Love, thy fatal flame. Ah! midst the sons of Revelry in vain Thy captive, Lesbia, struggles to be free! God of the grape, thy goblets while I drain, Still sways my breast Love's mightier Deity!— Let Harmony from her enchanting shell Pour the sweet note that sooths affliction's sigh: Now the full chord's deep modulation swell, Now wake the joy-inspiring symphony; Such as resounding from thy golden strings, Divine Alcæus! charm'd hell's shadowy throng; While combatants renown'd and tyrant kings Conquer'd or bled in thine immortal song. —te sonantem plenius aureo, Alcæe, plectro ? Pugnas et exactos Tyrannos. Say, could the voice of Melody subdue The pangs that tortur'd ghosts were doom'd to bear, And lull to strange repose the serpent-crew That hiss, Alecto, in thine iron hair? ? illis carminibus ? ? intorti capillis Eumenidum recreantur angues. Horat. lib. ii. Ode 13. Then let the cares that rend a lover's breast The magic of that voice resistless prove!— Still breathes th' enamour'd Bard his fond request In vain—for Music is the food of Love. When Eve's mild-echoing songs the vale pervade, Thy milder accents, Nymph belov'd, I hear: When the sad lute complains, by fancy's aid Thy soft expression sooths my ravish'd ear. Sweet the wild echoes of the valley,—Sweet Warbles the soft lute's melancholy note: But strains with richer melody replete From Lesbia's lips on gales of fragrance float.— Not Music, Wine, nor Solitude, can quell The tumults that this bleeding bosom knows. Then visit, God of Sleep, my pensive cell, And to my soul restore its lost repose! Auspicious to my pray'r the gloomy God Bids the deep shadows of the night arise; O'er my lone couch extends his sable rod, And seals with opiate charm his suppliant's eyes. Ah! whence that Virgin Bloom, on night's dun pall Whose glance with pity's mild effulgence beams? Dear Sov'reign of my soul, at Fancy's call 'Tis Lesbia comes to bless her Poet's dreams! Less lovely midst the never-fading flowers Of Paradise the fabled Houri strays! Less fair the nymphs of Schiras' cypress bowers That bloom in amorous Hafez' glowing lays! Schiras or Scheraz, the capital of Ancient Persia: said to derive its name from Cyrus.—The Poet Hafez, the Anacreon of the East, was entombed in this city, rich in nature's choicest luxuriance, and overshadowed with cypresses of unrivalled elevation and beauty. Dazzling the Phrygian Boy's enraptur'd sight Not Venus 'self with charms that rivall'd thine, 'Mid the broad shades of Ida's piny height To beauty's meed preferr'd her claim divine! “To Fairy glades, Blest Vision! lead the way, “O'er sands of gold where liquid chrystal roves; “Where drinks unclouded summer's genial ray “Incense exhal'd from aromatic groves: “Where o'er each shadowy dell and oak-crown'd steep “Celestial forms in bright succession glide; “Where light-rob'd nymphs th' unbending blossoms sweep, “Or rise in radiance from the tranquil tide: “Where, Lesbia! as I raise the song to Thee, “The list'ning Fauns their antic dance refrain; “And dulcet sounds of airy minstrelsy “From harps unseen accompany the strain. “And while th' impassion'd lay thy praises breathes “Each ruder gale subsides, ambrosial showers “Embathe the lavish blooms, and living wreaths “Of brighter green array the magic bow'rs. “And Love, light hovering in the balmy air, “Fires his proud torch and nerves his golden bow, “And braids his roseate bands for Thee, my Fair! “And bids thy breat his gentlest transports know. “Thine eyes confess his pow'r:—Stay waining Night! “Start not, Hyperion, from thine orient goal! “Ye blissful dreams, ye visions of delight, “Ye dear delusions, still possess my soul!”— Dissolving at th' unwelcome gleam of dawn, The spell that sway'd my captive sense expires: No liquid chrystal laves the fairy lawn; No viewless minstrels wake celestial lyres; No spicy groves unfading foilage spread; Beneath their nectarine freight no branches bend; No sylvan bands fantastic measures tread; No pearl-crown'd sisters from the wave ascend: The laughing meads where flow'rs spontaneous grew, The landscape's various grace, the genial skies In cloudless azure dress'd elude my view; And glowing Fancy's bright creation dies. But Thou, blest object of my hopes and fears, Still shall the Muse's living meed be thine, While grace enchants, while gentleness endears, While admiration bends at Beauty's shrine: Lesbia! for Thee affection's genuine glow Shall realize gay Fancy's fairy dream: For Thee, th' impassion'd tear, the lay shall flow, Warm from my heart while flows life's crimson stream. ODE IV. TO LESBIA'S LUTE. Ye powerful strings, from whose vibration flows Joy's thrilling tide and sadly pleasing woe: Soothing the sense, yet to the soul's repose Destructive as the nerve of Cupid's bow! With gentlest melody in Lesbia's ear (If any mortal sounds have pow'r to tell) Whisper how much I hope—how much I fear— The pity I implore—the pains I feel. When her light touch calls forth th' enlivening strain, Bid rapture float upon the charmed air: Tell her, when sad th' expressive notes complain: “So breathes thy bard the sigh of deep despair.” Of yore such sounds, as thrill th' enamour'd breast When Lesbia's hands the silver chords embrace, Could lull th' embattled elements to rest, Bend knotted oaks, and tame a ruthless race: Yet, Lesbia! like thy lute tho' Orpheus strung His lyre to strains divine, its amorous Lord For Thee had left Euridice unsung, And Pluto's gloomy confines unexplor'd. ODE V. TO THE NAIAD OF GLYMPTON BROOK. Naiad, unseen of mortal eyes, Whose light steps haunt this Current lone, Where gentle Zephyr's balmy sighs, With thy wild wave in unison, Blend their aërial melodies; Let me to thy deserted shades Reveal the never-dying flame That all my pensive soul pervades, And teach thine echoes Lesbia's name Ere the soft light of evening fades! Unheard, unnotic'd, let me rove Thy trembling osier wreaths among, And woo the Muse where none reprove Affection's unambitious song, Nor chide the plaint of hopeless love. There, when the day's dim eyelids close, Hide me within some shadowy cave; And, minist'ring to calm repose, Ah softly bid thy babbling wave Kiss the dank sedge that round it grows! No angler's cruel arts are mine, Ye timid tenants of the brook! Thrown from my hand no viewless line, Disguis'd by me no treacherous hook, Bids you your little lives resign. Nor this pellucid rill refrain To sip, ye minstrels of the air! Your downy plumage to distain With blood no fatal tube I bear, Nor pay with death your artless strain. That breast no savage joys can share, Where glow Affection's generous fires: Soft Pity finds her mansion there, All whom the breath of life inspires By her own sorrows taught to spare. Mine, gentle Naiad! be the dell Whose clear stream laves thy chrystal grot: Within its confines let me dwell, By all but One dear Maid forgot, And bid a world of cares farewell. Oft let me view thy trembling tide Chequer'd with Cynthia's silver light, What time, in Fancy's train descried, Before my fascinated sight Past Joy's illusive phantoms glide. Hopeless of happier hours to come, No more array'd in flattering hues For me the buds of Pleasure bloom: Yet deigns, at Fancy's call, the Muse To gild Affliction's deepening gloom. With Lesbia's praise the strain shall glow; Oh may she taste each bliss supreme That hope can paint, or love bestow; And calm as Glym's sequester'd stream May her life's gentle current flow! Wind, lovely Brook, thy murmuring way, Still with my sorrows sympathize: So may thy banks fresh flow'rs inlay, Thy waves in rich redundance rise, Mild Zephyrs on thy bosom play! If Zephyr should his breath deny, My sighs shall fan thy flowery beds: If parching rays thy channel dry, The tears desponding Passion sheds Shall its exhausted stream supply. ELEGY. WRITTEN AT SEA. On sapphire throne, o'er Heav'n's unnumber'd fires The moon in full-orb'd majesty presides; Calm are the seas, a favouring breeze transpires, While thro' the waves the Vessel smoothly glides: Beyond th' horizon's bound the mind extends, To the sought shores where Hope delusive leads; And flattering Fancy keen regret suspends For absent kindred, friends, and native meads: Till Sympathy from brooding Memory's stores Culls thorns, and plants them in the bleeding breast; Sunk into gloom the mind no more explores Hope's future dawn, and pants in vain for rest. What tho' the seas are calm, the skies serene, Thus anguish dictates the desponding strain: “To Friendship fear presents a gloomier scene, “The whirlwind's fury and tempestuous main. “Ev'n now perhaps from many a kindred eye “My dubious fate compels the generous tear, “And ev'ry passing cloud that veils the sky “Chills some fond anxious breast with boding fear. “In my Love's bosom deeper sorrows roll, “Frantic with dread she sighs, implores, she raves; “Whilst Horror paints me, to her sickening soul, “Dash'd on a rock, or whelm'd beneath the waves.” Father of Heav'n, whose power controls the storms, O let thy mercy hear a wanderer's pray'r! Check the wild fears connubial fondness forms, And save the tender Mourner from despair! For Me,—whate'er thy sov'reign will shall doom, Still give me faith to bear that lot resign'd: That faith which bursts the confines of the tomb, And, heav'n-aspiring, sooths th' afflicted mind. PHILEMON. AN ELEGY. Where shade yon yews the churchyard's lonely bourn, With faultering step, absorb'd in thought profound, Philemon wends in solitude to mourn, While Evening pours her deep'ning glooms around. Loud shrieks the blast, the sleety torrent drives, Wide spreads the tempest's desolating power; To grief alone Philemon reckless lives, No rolling peal he heeds, cold blast, or shower. For this the date that stampt his partner's doom; His trembling lips receiv'd her latest breath. “Ah! wilt thou drop one tear on Emma's tomb?” She cried: and clos'd each wistful eye in death. No sighs he breath'd, for anguish riv'd his breast, Her clay-cold hand he grasp'd, no tears he shed, 'Till fainting nature sunk by grief oppress'd, And ere distraction came all sense was fled. Now time has calm'd, not cur'd Philemon's woe, For grief like his life-woven never dies; And still each year's collected sorrows flow, As drooping o'er his Emma's tomb he sighs. WHITSUNTIDE. WRITTEN AT WINCHESTER COLLEGE ON THE IMMEDIATE APPROACH OF THE HOLIDAYS. Hence, thou fur-clad Winter, fly! Sire of shivering Poverty! Who, as thou creep'st with chilblains lame To the crowded charcoal flame, With chattering teeth and ague cold, Scarce thy shaking sides canst hold While Thou draw'st the deep cough out: God of Foot-ball's noisy rout, Tumult loud and boist'rous play, The dangerous slide, the snow-ball fray. But come, thou genial Son of Spring, Whitsuntide! and with thee bring Cricket, nimble boy and light, In slippers red and drawers white, Who o'er the nicely-measur'd land Ranges around his comely band, Alert to intercept each blow, Each motion of the wary foe. Or patient take thy quiet stand, The angle trembling in thy hand, And mark, with penetrative eye, Kissing the wave the frequent fly, Where the trout, with eager spring, Forms the many-circled ring, And, leaping from the silver tide, Turns to the sun his speckled side. Or lead where Health, a naiad fair, With rosy cheek and dripping hair, From the sultry noon-tide beam, Laves in Itchin's crystal-stream. Thy votaries, rang'd in order due, To-morrow's wish'd-for dawn shall view Greeting the radiant star of light With Matin Hymn and early rite: E'en now, these hallow'd haunts among, To Thee we raise the Choral Song; A Latin song, called “Domum,” sung with instrumental accompaniment, on the day before the commencement of their Whitsuntide vacation, by the scholars of Winchester College. The words “Matin Hymn, &amp;c.” in the preceding couplet refer to other ancient customs of that venerable seminary. And swell with echoing minstrelsy The strain of joy and liberty. If pleasures such as these await Thy genial reign, with heart elate For Thee I throw my gown aside, And hail thy coming, Whitsuntide. CHRISTMAS. Hence, Summer, indolently laid To sleep beneath the cooling shade! Panting quick with sultry heat, Thirst and faint Fatigue retreat! Come, Christmas! father Thou of Mirth, Patron of the festive hearth, Around whose social ev'ning flame The jovial song, the winter game, The chase renew'd in merry tale, The season's carols never fail. Who, tho' Winter chill the skies, Canst catch the glow of exercise, Following swift the foot-ball's course; Or with unresisted force, Where Frost arrests the harden'd tide, Shooting athwart the rapid slide. Who, ere the misty morn is grey, To some high covert hark'st away; While Sport, on lofty courser borne, In concert winds his echoing horn With the deeply-thund'ring hounds, Whose clangour wild, and joyful sounds, While echo swells the doubling cry, Shake the woods with harmony. How does my eager bosom glow To give the well known tally-ho! Or shew, with cap inverted, where Stole away the cautious hare! Or, if the blast of Winter keen Spangles o'er the silvery green, Booted high thou lov'st to tread, Marking, thro' the sedgy mead, Where the creeping moor-hen lies, Or snipes with sudden twittering rise: Or joy'st the early walk to take Where, thro' the pheasant-haunted brake Oft as the well-aim'd gun resounds, The eager-dashing spaniel bounds. For thee of buck my breeches tight, Clanging whip, and rowels bright, The hunter's cap my brows to guard, And suit of sportive green 's prepar'd: For, since these delights are thine, Christmas, with thy bands I join. FREE IMITATION OF A LATIN ODE, BY WALTER DE MAPES, ARCHDEACON OF OXFORD IN THE ELEVENTH CENTURY. I I'll in a tavern end my days 'Midst boon companions merry, Place at my lips a lusty flask Replete with sparkling sherry, That angels hov'ring round may cry, When I lie dead as door-nail: “Rise, genial Deacon, rise and drink “Of the well of Life Eternal.” II 'Tis wine the fading lamp of life Renews with flame celestial, And elevates th' enraptur'd sense Above this globe terrestrial: Be mine the grape's pure juice, unmix'd With any base ingredient! Water to heretics I leave, Sound churchmen have no need on't. III Crosiers for lordly priests provide, Let warriors wield the truncheon; I ask no implements beside A tankard and a luncheon: Verses and odes without good cheer I never could indite 'em, Sure he who meager days devis'd Is d?d ad infinitum! IV When I exhaust the bowl profound And gen'rous liquor swallow, Bright as the beverage I imbibe The gen'rous numbers follow; Your sneaking water-drinkers all I utterly condemn 'em, He that would write like Homer, Must drink like Agamemnon. V Mysteries and prophetic truths, I never could unfold 'em Without a flagon of good wine And a lusty slice of cold ham; But when my flagon I have drain'd, And eat what's in the dish up, Tho' I am but an Archdeacon, I Can preach like an Archbishop. SONG. [To Chloe kind and Chloe fair] To Chloe kind and Chloe fair, With sparkling eye and flowing hair, Tune the harp, and raise the song; Such as to Beauty doth belong! Let the strain be sweet and clear; Such as through the listening ear, In well according harmony, May with the 'tranced soul agree! She is Pleasure's blooming Queen: In the morn more fresh her mien, When awaken'd from repose, Than the summer's dewy rose: In the ev'ning brighter far Than the ocean-bathed star. And when Night, the friend of love, Bids the silent hour improve, To the ravish'd senses She Gives joy, and bliss, and ecstasy. THE RENOWNED HISTORY AND RARE ACHIEVEMENTS OF JOHN WILKES. AN HEROIC BALLAD. DICERE RES GRANDES NOSTRO DAT MUSA POETÆ. Persius, Sat. 1. Full often I have read, inscrib'd On parchment and on vellum, The deeds of ancient heroes and The chances that befel 'em; And ballads I have heard rehears'd By harmonists itinerant, Who modern worthies celebrate, Yet scarcely make a dinner on't: Some of whom sprang from noble race, And some were in pigstye born; Dependent upon royal grace, Or triple tree of Tyburn. And sundry gallants yet unsung, Who scarcely have their fellows, Amendments move in parliament, Or live by mending bellows: But of all who were or will be sung In solemn stave or ditty, There's none can vie with Johnny Wilkes, The Chamberlain of the City. CHORUS. John Wilkes he was for Middlesex, They chose him knight of the shire: And he made a fool of Alderman Bull, And call'd Parson Horne a lyar. Homer, for provender and fame, When he was blind and pennyless, Descanted of the Spartan Dame Who a cuckold made of Menelaus: His heroes' sounding names you've heard, Whose blood or brains were spill'd in Troy's siege, as long as Nestor's beard, Which rooks their nests did build in. Virgil Æneas sung, of yore Approv'd a valiant soldier; Thro' slaughter, smoke, and flame, he bore His dad upon his shoulder: (Else had some swaggering Grecian boy Soon made a hole in his skin, And spitted him in burning Troy To roast like a pork griskin.) Æneas hence for piety Was fam'd, or folks belie him; Yet Helenus was as good as he, And chaplain to King Priam. But why the merits do I vaunt Of chaplain or of layman? John Wilkes was brave as John of Gaunt, Religious as a Bramin: Where wit or weapon came in play Nothing for John was too hard; He wrote against the King all day, And at night he fought his Steward. A minute detail of the duel which Mr. Wilkes fought with Lord Talbot, Steward of the Household, is given in “Letters to and from Mr. Wilkes,” published in 1760. Eke was he Friar of Medenham, For an account of the Monks of Medenham, and the consternation excited among the members of that irreverend order, during the celebration of their scandalous rites, by Brother Wilkes's Monkey, consult the third volume of “Chrysal,” or “The Adventures of a Guinea.” And for a particular description of Medenham Abbey, see the “Letters to Mr. Wilkes” beforementioned. And liv'd in orthodoxy; For, when he could not pray himself, The Monkey was his proxy. CHORUS. John Wilkes he was for Middlesex, &amp;c. Old Shylock, the Jew-broker, Was both covetous and cruel; He hoarded up his ducats, and He dined on watergruel; And, when Anthonio could not pay The monies he had borrow'd, He pull'd out his snickersnee With imprecations horrid: “Thy bond is forfeited,” he cried, “The penalty, I ask it; “Ay, and a pound of Christian flesh “I'll cut from thy bread-basket.” But, when poor Sylva John besought That he would but name his pay-day, John swore that he had no such word In his Encyclopedia: Whereat this patient Israelite He waxed wondrous ire: But lo! John chous'd him of his bond, And he burnt it in the fire. Mr. Wilkes, having been repeatedly solicited by Sylva, a Jew, to discharge a bond and other securities, which he had given him to a considerable amount, at length appointed a day and hour for that express purpose, inviting his creditor to breakfast with him at the same time. The Jew, punctual to his engagement, met with the most flattering reception, and sat down to a special dèjunè dinè most exquisitely seasoned with the wit and vivacity of his host, who unlocked his scrutoire and made a display of cash and bank notes, minutely inquiring of Sylva the amount of what he owed him, and whether he had brought with him every receipt which was requisite to exonerate his debtor from future demands. The bond and necessary papers were of course produced, and freely submitted by Sylva (whom the fascinating pleasantry of his host had thrown intirely off his guard) to Mr. Wilkes's inspection, who, availing himself of the confidence reposed in him, instantaneously committed them to the flames; and seizing the poker, which he had purposely suffered to become red hot in the fire, employed it in keeping his distracted creditor at bay till the bond, &amp;c. &amp;c. were consumed to ashes. This detail is faithfully given from the statement of the unlucky sufferer himself. CHORUS. John Wilkes he was for Middlesex, &amp;c. Fair Hannah Snell her farthingale Pull'd off and, under cover Of breeches and a soldier's coat, Pursued her absent lover: Her bodkin to a pike transform'd, She brandish'd in her right hand, And Frenchmen's souls, thro' eyelet holes I' their carcases, she frighten'd: This female musqueteer her foes As flat as flounders laid 'em; Powder and ball serv'd her instead Of powder and pomatum. Paris, for love of Helena, Kindled a fierce combustion; Consum'd in flames the town of Troy, And Priam's breeches fustian. And great Alcides, son of Jove, Maugre his strength and valour, For love of beauteous Omphale Became a woman's taylor: He, who th' Augëan stables cleans'd, A kerchief hemm'd to please her: Antæus once he squeez'd to death, But now became mop-squeezer: Yet all this he endur'd for love, And eke bore many an hard drub: But for love of Parson Horne's lac'd coat John—stole away his Wardrobe. The articles comprized in this clerical wardrobe, for the satisfaction of the curious reader, are subjoined, viz. 1 Suit of scarlet and gold, cloth. 1 Suit of white and silver, cloth. 1 Suit of blue and silver; camblet. 1 Suit of flowered silk. 1 Suit of black silk. 1 Black velvet surtout. These many-coloured Canonicals which our hero, retorting a quotation of Horace upon his quondam intimate, (and, what is no less extraordinary than it is evident from his own letter, misunderstanding the passage itself) calls, the “Vestimenta pretiosa of Eutrapelus,” his reverend Correspondent, it seems, entrusted to his custody in May, 1767, and charges him with having pawned in Paris to supply his necessities in the September following. See pages 37, 39, 40, 67. of Controversial Letters of John Wilkes, Esq. &amp;c.—Williams, Fleet-street, 1771. CHORUS. John Wilkes he was for Middlesex, &amp;c. Mahomet, marching at the head Of his victorious rabble, His apostolic mission prov'd With sword irrefragable; A heaven of wine and women preach'd, To make men more devout; And if he fail'd to turn their brains His Saracens beat 'em out: Gabriel took Mahomet to heav'n And did a mule provide him; And thus John Wilkes to Brentford rode With Parson Horne beside him: There 'mongst the men of Middlesex Renown and fame he got him, And chosen was to mend the state, Because 'twas old and rotten: And Chamberlain was after made For 's just and righteous dealings; They wisely trusted to his charge All their half-crowns and shillings. Then a fig for Mecca's saint, a fig For Tartar, Turk, or Saracen! Our Chamberlain, that rascal race, Excels beyond comparison: Their Prophet was an arrant cheat; John Wilkes is no impostor: He cares no more for the Alcoran Than for the Pater Noster. CHORUS. John Wilkes he was for Middlesex, &amp;c. Renown'd in ancient story was St. George, the Capadocian, Whose spear, like turkey-rhubarb, set The dragon's guts in motion. Achilles Hector did assail, Transfix'd him with his javelin, Then dragg'd him at his horse's tail Round every Trojan ravelin. Ryance his mantle lined with beards Of kings, instead of ermine; See the Ballad:— “When Arthur, at Camelford, kept his Court royal.” Reliques of Antient Poetry. And Arthur's royal chin to shave With 's broad-sword did determine; But Arthur quell'd the Welchman's boast, He kill'd him dead as door-nail, And sent him down his cheese to toast At Pluto's fire infernal. Intrepid Guy of Warwick to A giant gave defiance, Cut off his head and made him an Example to all giants: A fierce dun cow came in his way, And on the head he knock'd her; But valorous John Wilkes, he cow'd Sir William Beauchamp Proctor. CHORUS. John Wilkes he was for Middlesex, &amp;c. King Nebuchadnezzar Liv'd in a costly palace; He wore a crown of gold, and drank Out of a golden chalice: He was the cock of eastern kings And Babylon he builded; His mutton was in silver serv'd And his gingerbread was gilded. In Dura's plain, this prince profane, A golden giant set up, So big the guildhall giants he Could both of them have eat up! A swinging dog, taller than Og, The monster-king of Basan; Colbrand and Pantagruel eke He would have turn'd his ? on. Forthwith the monarch gave command That men of every nation Should to his idol bow the knee, And pay him adoration: And certain honest Israelites, Who disobey'd his motion, He in a fiery furnace cast, To kindle their devotion; To broil and spitchcock 'em like eels It was his royal pleasure: Yet scap'd unsear'd each Hebrew beard— No God-a-mercy—'Nezzar! For, furnace-proof, Shadrach and Co. Combustibles were lost on; Faith had envelop'd them, I trow, With gabardine ????????: The breast-plate of faith. 1 Thess. v. Who, through faith, quenched the violence of fire. Hebr. xi. Abash'd the tyrant stood amidst His parasites and pandars, To see his bonfire set at nought By a leash of Salamanders: But when a brother of their tribe His bond produced, and boasted He'd be too hard for Wilkes, sly John The Jew completely roasted. CHORUS. John Wilkes he was for Middlesex, &amp;c. Your Ostrich, he will swallow brass, And iron he loves dearly: He'll pick up a gross of tenpenny nails As cocks and hens do barley. Powell, as some folks take small beer To cool 'em when they 've drank hard, Steep'd in his brandy capsicum, Like burrage in cold tankard: And redhot coals, instead of rolls, Ate for his breakfast duly, Burnt brimstone, gunpowder, and pitch, To him were soup and bouillie: Sky-rockets, 'stead of sausages, Ran hissing down his weasen; Wash'd down with aqua-fortis strong, To keep his guts from freezing. The Dragon of Wantley churches ate, (He us'd to come on a Sunday) Whole congregations were to him A dish of Salmagundi: He gave no quarter, no not he, To clergymen or laymen: Crack'd ev'n the Sexton's jobberknowl, And spoil'd him for saying amen: He pouch'd the Prebendaries all, Who ne'er gave him an ill word; Snapp'd up the Dean, as snug in his stall As a maggot in a filbert. The Corporation worshipful He valued not an ace, But swallow'd the Mayor, asleep in his chair, And pick'd his teeth with the mace. He brows'd on monumental brass Fix'd in the wall o' th' cloysters; And shoals of bawling choristers He ate, like scallop'd oysters. He quarrell'd with the steeple clock And ate him while he was striking; Bell-ropes he munch'd for chitterlings, Tho' they wer'n't so much to his liking: Tombstones and monuments he took For pills to cool his palate; And cropt the church-yard yew-trees all— They serv'd him for a sallad. The organ that so loud did roar Devour'd he in his frolick; And batten'd on the bellows-blower, For he fear'd not the wind-colick. To 'scape his sacrilegious maw This Dragon he gave none chance, But swallow'd the knave that set the stave, And felt no qualm of conscience: Parsons were his black-puddings, and Fat Aldermen his capons; And his tid-bit, the collection plate Brimful of Birmingham halfpence. Clerks, Curates, Rectors, Bishops ate This Dragon most uncivil; And (but he never comes to church) He would have eat the Devil. But the men of Aylesbury esteem John Wilkes a greater rarity: They made Him trustee for their school, And He swallow'd up the Charity. CHORUS. John Wilkes he was for Middlesex, They chose him knight of the shire: And he made a fool of Alderman Bull, And call'd Parson Horne a liar. SONG. [Tho' Fortune may boast at her shrine] Tho' Fortune may boast at her shrine That the world's adoration is paid, No idol shall she be of mine: No devotion I owe the blind jade: Yet rich in affection I live, For tell me what boon so divine Has a world of luxuriance to give As one smile, my dear Mary! of thine? The glitt'ring distinctions of state May the envy of sycophants move; But who would forego, to be great, Independance, contentment, and love? Gems and ore do not fall to my share, But what gem can such transport impart As one glance of thy kindness, my Fair! What mine 's half so rich as thy heart? With Fate let them quarrel that choose, Chagrin shall ne'er furrow my brow, To the pray'r of thy swain let the Muse, Dear Maid! be propitious as Thou. Then a truce with thy counsels, old Care, Not a sigh at thy bidding I'll breathe: For, though sombre the garb that I wear, Yet light is my heart underneath. A CRUST FOR A CONVEYANCER. Hear, with patient attention, a tragical tale, Which will make our episcopal Synod turn pale, Who from these simple stanzas—if ever they read 'em— Will find that the lawyers must soon supersede 'em. Derry down, &amp;c. For our Bishops so learn'd, and our Deans orthodox, And Rectors take little account of their flocks, But leave unconcern'd their lay-lambs in the lurch:— So Conveyancers henceforth must govern the church. The gods—Epicurus averr'd long ago— With indiff'rence beheld revolutions below; They drank nectar and feasted, nor cared half-a-crown Though mankind, like the French, turn'd the globe upside down: Thus our gossips aver that their lordships in lawn Have from things of this world their attention withdrawn, And, intent on the next, of each church leave the care To Curates no better than him of Q????'s square. And in truth to this Curate old Nick ow'd a grudge; For—although in the pulpit as grave as a judge— Yet folks, who his conduct have narrowly scann'd, Say he did not put quite enough starch in his band. That, besides, he'd imbib'd an heretical notion, That “a Parson may laugh—till he's rais'd to promotion:” Nay a joke had been heard at a vestry to crack, And would dabble in rhyme though his coat it was black. Some, who held themselves censors of no little note, Said he'd preach better doctrine than—ever he wrote: But, what's worst, in the service, no vacuum or gap, No pause he'd allow for—good Christians to nap. Though they own'd, to atone for the last mention'd crime, He'd engag'd an Assistant who read to slow time: So, should slumber, in spite of his efforts, o'ertake 'em, No danger there was that his colleague might wake 'em.— Yet—as if these high crimes were but slight peccadilloes— The parishioners rested at ease on their pillows, Their pastors they follow'd, their puddings they ate 'em; And so they may still—would John H??????y let 'em. A Conveyancer he is—employ him who list: Forbidding his aspect, and close is his fist; With more coin in his pocket than brains in his head, Yet a book he has written that nobody read: The Life of Lord Mansfield. “Sooner shall ? “Great Mansfield fall by an attorney's hand. “See a long law-life, in 4to. of the great Earl Mansfield, Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench, by Mr. Holliday, in a very peculiar style indeed. For the greater part, it is a bundle of reports and law pleadings strung together. It is astonishing to me that conveyancers and attorneys, who really appear not to know how to construct a single sentence without provoking a smile at some error in grammar, language, or metaphor, will think themselves qualified to deliver down to posterity the lives of great men. Luckily Mr. Holliday's zeal does not offend us in rhyme. The friendship and the verse of Pope, as well as the splendour of his own abilities, and the dignity of their high exertions, have secured an eternity of reputation to Lord Chief Justice Mansfield, which can never fall, even by Mr. Holliday's attempt.”—Pursuits of Literature, 7th edit. page 322. And projected, besides, a Commercial Canal, Which no water replenish'd, and none ever shall: Yet the drift on't was such as (to make him amends) Fill'd his own, while it emptied the fobs of his friends. The reader, who would be more fully informed on this head, will please to consult the Contributors to Mr. H's Commercial undertaking, who are well qualified to give him the proper explanation. To the gizzard it griev'd this pestiferous Don, That matters at church went so quietly on. Thought he: these viles Curates I'll haul o'er the coals, And jobation bestow—for the good of their souls. I'm unjustly accounted a niggard, I trow, Since, if one hand withholds, I with t'other bestow: This truth I'll our church reformation make good in; They shall taste my rebuke who ne'er tasted my pudding. But although for her sons I've a tickler of birch, I've an high veneration for Good Mother Church: And—unless for reproof when she needs my assistance— To evince my respect—I still keep at a distance. The pious Conveyancer has no seat in his parish church. To the vestry, indignant, he then stalk'd away, Where church-wardens and sides-men sat rang'd in array: And so grim did he look that their conclave astounded Thought they saw Hamlet's ghost, or Don Quixotte dismounted. “He was led there”—he said, when he first stood before 'em— “Lest one should be wanting to make up their quorum:” Now though this his exordium he knew was a lie, 'Twas but one of a dozen he'd got cut and dry. Then he open'd and emptied a budget so black, Of charge and surcharge on divinity's back: What! charge and surcharge a poor Curate—O fye on't! But who knows?—he mistook him perhaps for his client. “In sooth, my good sirs, you two Parsons have got: “One gets on whip and spur, t'other drawls like a sot: “One scampers away, sirs, to preach at Spring Gardens, Spring Garden's Chapel, where the Curate was engaged as morning preacher. “And, how t'other limps after him, cares not three farthings. “In charity, sirs, I your case would amend, “Who, with two ghostly guides, can on neither depend— “For when one goes to heaven, by what I can find “From my gossip's reports, he will leave you behind: “And I doubt with the other no better you'll fare, “He's so tardy that he nor you scarce will get there: “Then—which ever you trust to—you'll all be made fools: “Down your souls must go, dish'd 'twixt two spiritual stools.”— “But all this, I maintain, is no subject of laughter “Amongst us sound churchmen who think on hereafter; “Then so much for the Next World:—And now, sirs, the bills “Give me leave to prefer of your Secular ills. “And I think, I should soften the bowels of Jews, “When I shew how your Parsons will thin all your pews: “The Church-wardens' receipts—they'll be not worth a tester; “Then adieu to roast turkey at Christmas and Easter! “For I'm credibly told by respectable folks, “What with this Jack of Styles and that other of Nokes, “Your two black-coats I mean, whose deserts I've discuss'd “Quite impartial:—for, faith! I don't know which is worst. “That confusion at church has took place of devotion, “Men, women, and children, are all in commotion, “Girls titter, as if they were looking a farce on, “When to publish the banns comes your galloping Parson: “And when, in his turn, reads your Reverend Drone, “Your ailes they all cough, all your galleries groan; “Your wives cry; “Good by t'ye.”—Your brats turn their backs, “And old maids, stiff as buckram, their muscles relax. “But to strike you with dread, consternation, and awe, “Know, to boot, the great Lord at the head of the law “To this scandalous state of affairs is no stranger. “'Tis not fit that He should, when the church is in danger. “This calamitous truth, sirs, it shocks me to mention: “To have taken a pew was his Lordship's intention, “And had my good Lord at Q????'s square took a pew, “Why—perhaps you had seen there John H??????y too. “His Lordship, to shew he was not over nice, “Condescended to visit your church once or twice; “And, I'll stake all my vast Biographical fame!— “Twice my Lord went away, sirs, as wise as he came. “Sirs, believe me, my Lord went away quite disgusted: “Or—Conveyancer H??????y 's not to be trusted! “And, if there you can catch him again, for your pains “You shall take out and butter John H??????y's brains. “No,—depend on't, his Lordship has beat his retreat: “For he since at the Foundling applied for a seat, “Where all things, of course, must be done with decorum; “Since Conveyancer H??????y 's one of the quorum.” Thus Conveyancer H??????y clos'd his attack, Thought his worship:—The Curate I've thrown on his back: I've in Chancery put him;—he ne'er can appeal, Since sentence against him has pass'd the Great Seal. The church-bell it rang;—hied the Curate away, Glad enough to escape with old ladies to pray, And “Deliver us”—'tis thought in his Litany cried— “From Conveyancers, Lord, and the Devil beside!” But when he got home and had wetted his whistle, Of the noble Law-Lord, in respectful epistle, To be told if his Lordship's opinion—he pray'd— Had been by this Conveyancer truly convey'd. And, whate'er you may think on't, with great condescension To his query my Lord gave immediate attention; And absolv'd from all censure the church of Q????'s Square: For his Lordship—God bless us!—had never been there!!! And obligingly deign'd to inform him beside; For a seat at the Foundling he ne'er had applied! And to worship his Maker his Lordship's research Was confin'd to the pale of his own parish church.— Then for lying John H??????y who cares a straw? Let the Tail of the church bless the Head of the law. And may Providence—mending their morals and dinners— From Conveyancing Saints guard all Clerical Sinners! Derry down, &amp;c. THE NOBLE SANS-CULOTTE. A BALLAD, IN HONOUR OF A CERTAIN EARL WHO STYLED HIMSELF A SANS-CULOTTE CITIZEN, IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS. Rank, character, distinction, fame, And noble birth forgot, Hear Stanhope, modest Earl, proclaim Himself a Sans-Culotte! Of pomp and splendid circumstance The vanity he teaches; And spurns, like Citizen of France, Both coronet and breeches. But, thrown away on lordly ears, His counsel none attend: No pattern take his brother Peers By Stanhope's latter end. Let Commoners for Britain's weal Their patriot bottoms bare: Lords are no Sans-Culottes:—they veil That part with special care. They vaunt aristocratic tails In silk and velvet 'dight: And, well accoutred, each assails With taunts a naked wight. “At one end, says the noble Peer, “No breeches I retain: “From this confession we infer “At t'other end no brain. “Whoe'er alike unfurnish'd views “Both nether end and upper, “May swear there's not a pin to choose “'Twixt pericrane and crupper.” But what care We for lordly spies, A ministerial band, The nakedness who scrutinize Of Opposition land? What tho' they deem us poor and bare, Like those lean kine Egyptian— Patriots there are who breeches wear— When paid for by Subscription. With nature's buff (tho' Buff and Blue Be scant) provided each is: No fustian if our bottoms shew, There's plenty in—our speeches. Nay, what if brains and breeches fail, Let's hear no more about 'em; Since Stanhope, ay, and L?????dale, Can make a shift without 'em. Say, for what purpose and intent Are brains and breeches fit? Breeches to hide our shame are meant, Brains serve to shew our wit. Then, to the case in point you know, Both must be misapplied Till L?????dale has wit to shew, And Stanhope shame to hide.— God save King George, and give his grace To George the Prince of Wales; And to all British Peers a case, Wherein to keep their tails! Queen Charlotte's welfare Heav'n promote, And show'r its gifts upon her; And from each noble Sans-Culotte Defend the Maids of Honour! BALLAD ON THE BREAKING OF THE WATER-HEAD, NEAR WINDSOR GREAT PARK, COMMONLY CALLED THE POND-HEAD. When ??? was employ'd to construct the Pond Head, As he ponder'd the task, to himself thus he said: “Since a Head I must make, what's a head but a Noddle? “So I think I had best take my own for a model.” Derry down, &amp;c. Then his work our Projector began out of hand, The outside he constructed with rubbish and sand, But brains on this Head had been quite thrown away, Those he kept for himself, so he lined it with clay. An head thus compacted and well put together Bade defiance, he thought, both to water and weather, With profound admiration must strike all beholders, And all heads must surpass but the head on his shoulders. The fam'd Friar Bacon he 'counted an ass, Tho' the head that He made was a blockhead of brass; And he little suspected it e'er should be said, That himself all this while was not right in his Head. But the water at length, to his utter dismay, A bank-ruptcy made, and his Head ran away; 'Twas a thick head for certain; but, had it been thicker, No head can endure that is always in liquor. It was owing no doubt to some capital error, That one Broken Head struck the country with terror; Yet 'twas well for the folks whom this deluge surrounded That, born to be hang'd, there were none of them drowned. Trump's Mill in the bottom was never supplied, Since first it went round, with so plenteous a tide: Yet the Miller he wish'd that our Head-maker's skill Less water had sent and more grist to his mill. Our Projector in truth left him little to brag on, When his meal-sacks march'd off without horses or waggon; And to rescue himself he must fain stir his stumps: Such an odd trick was play'd on this Miller of Trump's! Yet ??? full as ill as the Miller has sped, And atones for his fault with the loss of his Head: Tho' some folks will tell you, (believe 'em who list) Long ago had he lost it, 't would ne'er have been miss'd. Now, although I must own 'tis a difficult case, In discussing this head, to preserve a grave face; More compassion its Maker may challenge than satire, Since 'tis plain that he can't keep his Head above water. This at least may be urg'd in his favour I deem; His is not the first Head which has gone with the stream: And—as for his Honour—'tis safe you may swear, Since Butler has told us that lodges elsewhere. ? Hudibras gave him a twitch, As quick as light'ning in the br?ch, Just in the place where honour 's lodg'd, As wise philosophers have judg'd, Because a kick in that place more Hurts Honour than deep wounds before. Hudibras, Part ii. c. 3. Hence, by way of a Moral, the fallacy 's shewn Of the maxim that Two Heads are better than One; For none e'er was so scurvily dealt with before, By the Head that he made, and the Head that he wore. Derry down, &amp;c. WILLIAM OF WICKHAM, A SONG, FOR THE WICCAMICAL ANNIVERSARY, HELD AT THE CROWN AND ANCHOR TAVERN. I sing not your heroes of ancient romance: Capadocian George, or Saint Dennis of France; No chronicler I am Of Troy and King Priam, And those crafty old Greeks who to fritters did fry 'em: But your voices, brave boys, one and all I bespeak 'em, In due celebration of William of Wickham. CHORUS. Let Wickham's brave boys, at the Crown and the Anchor, The flask never quit 'till clean out they have drank her; And united maintain, whether sober or mellow, That old Billy Wickham was a very fine fellow. Hear the Lover, you'll learn, from his tragical stories Of hard-hearted Phœbe, Corinna, and Chloris, For some sempstress or starcher That rascally archer Call'd Cupid, has made him as mad as a March hare: But at Wickham's brave boys should he brandish his dart, We'll drown the blind rogue in a Winchester quart. CHORUS. For Wickham's brave boys, &amp;c. Let the Soldier, who prates about storming the trenches Of fortified towns, and of fair-visag'd wenches, My numbers give heed to, And, drinking as we do, Shut up in its scabbard his martial toledo: For we too shed blood, yet all danger escape, Since the blood that we shed is the blood of the grape. CHORUS. Let Wickham's brave boys, &amp;c. Let Lawyers, accustom'd to quarrel and brawl, Play the devil as usual in Westminster Hall, Reputations bespatter, Yet thrive and grow fatter, While they dash wrong and right up as cookmaids do batter: Here good fellowship reigns and, what's stranger by far, No mischief ensues from a call to the Bar. CHORUS. Let Wickham's brave boys, &amp;c. The Empiric profound, who in heathenish Latin Such potions prescribes as might poison old Satan, With blister and bolus And draught would cajole us, 'Till snug under ground he has clapt in a hole us: But the wise sons of Wickham his regimen slight, They swallow no draughts but of red wine and white. CHORUS. Let Wickham's brave boys, &amp;c. Let Whig Rhetoricians our rulers defame, And hungry Sedition's republican flame Foment, and throw chips on, Independance their lips on, While they incense a mob, and exist by Subscription: Here of Liberty's Tree if for scyons they search, They'll instead catch a tartar,—Wiccamical Birch. CHORUS. Let Wickham's brave boys, &amp;c. Ye Poetical tribe, on Parnassus who forage, Who prate of Jove's nectar and Helicon-porridge, Yet, for beef-stakes and brandy, Set each Jack-a-dandy On a level with Frederick, or Prince Ferdinandy: What's the sword of King Arthur, or Admiral Hosier, To William of Wickham and his jolly old Crosier! CHORUS. Let Wickham's brave boys, at the Crown and the Anchor, The flask never quit 'till clean out they have drank her; And united maintain, whether sober or mellow, That old Billy Wickham was a very fine fellow. THE HERMITAGE. Beneath thy shelter, lowly Cell! How blest is he who bids farewell The world, and vain delights foregoes For calm content, and bland repose! Can the dome of costly mould, Fretted arch emboss'd with gold, Lavish sculpture's proud design, Sooth the soul with charms like thine? I love thy solitary gloom, I love the roses wild that bloom Around thy porch—I love to trace Thy precincts, where each simple grace Surpasses all that art hath plann'd; Thy roof of spar, and floor of sand, Thy thick-wove thatch with moss o'ergrown, Thy whispering rill, whose current lone The ozier flings its wreaths aslant, And sapphire-plumed halcyons haunt: And, stretch'd thy rushy couch along, To listen to the blackbird's song, Hear him his amorous pains relate Melodious to his jetty mate. While faintly born upon the breeze The dove's responsive murmurs please; And from the sheep-cote in the dell Soft tinkling chimes the weather's bell, Accordant to the chearful strain Of milk-maid blithe, and whistling swain. And, ere the western waves absorb The beams of Day's refulgent orb, I love to traverse, unespied, Thy beach-clad hillock's verdant side, O'er each dun brake and shadowy dell, While Fancy breathes her magic spell, Assembling all her sylvan clan, Her dryads, fauns, and laughing Pan; Or calls the Muses from the spheres With heavenly strains to soothe mine ears, Or conjures up äerial forms To marshal all the fairy swarms That quaff their acorn cups, and sing, And frisk, and dance in sportive ring, Tinging, where'er their tracks are seen, The circled sward with richer green. Or wend with Meditation thro' The deep, umbrageous avenue Emerging oft, the groves between, On flowery lawn, or pasture green, Or upland, whence, to feast my sight A thousand beauteous scenes unite; The venerable oaks that wear The rich robe of the waining year, Studded with sails the river's tide, Diffusing wealth and verdure wide; Tall cliffs illumin'd with the gleam Of downward Titan's glowing beam, The fleecy tribes that seek their fold, Empurpled clouds with skirts of gold, Redundant sheaves of ripen'd grain, And shadows lenghthening on the plain: Till, summon'd by the curfew's sound, While falling dews embathe the ground, Again I seek the friendly shade From whence my devious steps have stray'd, Repass the lawn, and hawthorn dell, Regain thy shelter, lowly Cell! There spread my board with simplest fare; Supremely blest if Cynthia share The mellow treasures Autumn gives, The beverage nectar-yielding hives To crown my rural cheer impart, And yield me in return her heart. THE BARBER'S NUPTIALS. Qui facere assuerat— Candida de Nigris. Ovid Met. Who bleach'd with lather jowls unshorn, Though blacker than the devil's horn. In Liquorpond-street, as is well known to many, An Artist resided who shav'd for a penny, Cut hair for three-halfpence, for three-pence he bled, And would draw, for a groat, every tooth in your head. What annoy'd other folks never spoil'd his repose, 'Twas the same thing to him whether stocks fell or rose, For blast and for mildew he car'd not a pin; His crops never fail'd, for they grew on the chin. Unvex'd by the cares that ambition and state has, Contented he dined on his daily potatoes; And the pence that he earn'd by excision of bristle Were nightly devoted to whetting his whistle. When copper ran low he made light of the matter, Drank his purl upon tick at the Old Pewter Platter, Read the news, and as deep in the secret appear'd As if he had lather'd the Minister's beard. But Cupid, who trims men of every station, And 'twixt barbers and beaux makes no discrimination; Would not let this superlative shaver alone, 'Till he tried if his heart was as hard as his hone. The Fair One, whose charms did the Barber enthral, At the end of Fleet Market of fish kept a stall: As red as her cheek no boil'd lobster was seen, Not an eel that she sold was as soft as her skin. By love strange effects have been wrought, we are told, In all countries and climates, hot, temperate, and cold; Thus the heart of our Barber love scorch'd to a coal, Tho' 'tis very well known he liv'd under the Pole. First, he courted his charmer in sorrowful fashion, And lied like a lawyer to move her compassion: He should perish, he swore, did his suit not succeed, And a barber to slay was a barbarous deed. Then he alter'd his tone, and was heard to declare, If valour deserv'd the regard of the fair, That his courage was tried, tho' he scorn'd to disclose How many brave fellows he 'd took by the nose. He was known for a patriot staunch, and his shop The resort of each true constitutional Crop: The Whig Club, of worth patriotic the nursery, He gratis had shav'd on their grand anniversary. Thus this Knight of the Bason confounded together Courage, politics, love, desperation, and lather: But his hard-hearted Mistress, she set him at nought; No gudgeon was she, nor so easily caught. Indignant She answer'd: “No chin-scraping sot “Shall be fasten'd to me by the conjugal knot: “No!—to Tyburn repair, if a noose you must tie, “Other fish I have got, Mr. Tonsor, to fry. “Holborn-bridge and Black-friars my triumphs can tell, “From Billingsgate beauties I've long born the bell: “Nay, tripemen and fishmongers vie for my favour— “Then d'ye think I'll take up with a Twopenny Shaver? “Let dory, or turbot, the sov'reign of fish, “Cheek by jowl with red herring be serv'd in one dish; “Let sturgeon and sprats in one pickle unite, “When I angle for husbands and barbers shall bite.” But the Barber persisted (Ah, could I relate 'em!) To ply her with compliments soft as pomatum; And took ev'ry occasion to flatter and praise her, Till she fancied his wit was as keen as his razor. With fair speeches cajol'd, as you 'd tickle a trout, 'Gainst the Barber the Fishwife no more could hold out, He applied the right bait, 'twas with flattery he caught her; Without flattery a female 's a fish out of water. The state of her heart when the Barber once guess'd Love's siege with redoubled exertion he press'd; With profuse panegyric his charmer preferring To maids, widows, and wives, fish, flesh, and red herring. The flame to allay that their bosoms did s? burn, They set off for the church of St. Andrew in Holborn, Where tonsors and trulls, country dicks and their cousins, In the halter of wedlock are tied up by dozens. The nuptials to grace came, from every quarter, The worthies at Rag Fair old caxons who barter; Who the coverings of judges and counsellors' nobs Cut down into majors, queus, scratches, and bobs: Musclemongers and oystermen, crimps, and coalh?avers, And butchers with marrowbones smiting their cleavers; Blind fidlers and bag-pipers, taylors and tylers, Bawds, boot-catchers, bailiffs, and blackpudding-boilers. From their voices united such melody flow'd As the Abbey ne'er witness'd, nor Tott'nham Court Road: While Saint Andrew's brave bells did so loud and so clear ring, You'd have given ten pounds to 've been out of their hearing. For his fee—when the parson this couple had join'd, As no Cash was forth-coming, he took it in kind: So the Bridegroom dismantled his rev'rence's chin, And the Bride entertain'd him with pilchards and gin. A MORSEL FOR A MUSSULMAN: OR, A REVELATION OF THE FUTURE STATE OF DECEASED FEMALES, IN REFUTATION OF THE SUPPOSED MAHOMETAN DOCTRINE, ASSERTING THAT WOMEN HAVE NO SOULS, AND ARE EXCLUDED FROM PARADISE. ? Non Me impia namque Tartara habent tristesque umbræ: sed amœna— Concilia Elysiumque colo. Virg. Æn. i. 5. From the blest realms where Paradise displays Her empyrëan splendour's ceaseless blaze, And bids her groves of vegetable gold To genial gales immortal blooms unfold; From nectar'd streams where Houris, heavenly-fair, Bathe the bright tresses of their odorous hair; To Zeineb, loveliest of the passive train, That 'midst the Haram's hated glooms complain, Alzira's happy shade appearing, steals A pause from bliss, and thus her state reveals: “Say to the tyrant man, whose pride denies “Thy sex a Soul, and bars them from the skies, “That when the date of female worth expires, “And sickening Nature yields her latest fires, “When beams no more the lustre of the eye, “And Death o'er Beauty hails his victory, “To life by Fate recall'd, the Sex assume “Celestial charms, and never-fading bloom; “In roseate bowers recline, or blissful rove “Thro' scenes of boundless joy and rapturous love; “That there, so Heaven ordains, a blooming band “Of youths, obsequious to each Fair's command, “Attentive waits, and, as her fancy wills, “Each task of duty or of love fulfills.— “Then to the peremptory tyrant say: “Who hopes this lot in Heav'n must here obey, “Bow to superior worth, to sense refin'd, “Bless the benignant sway of womankind, “Hail the fair fabric of an hand divine, “And own the soul that animates the shrine.— “Or, driv'n for ever from the realms above, “His soul in vain shall pant for heavenly love.” SONNET. TO THE RED-BREAST. When that the fields put on their gay attire Silent Thou sitst near brake or river's brim, Whilst the glad Thrush sings loud from covert dim: But when pale Winter lights the social fire, And meads with slime are sprent, and ways with mire, Thou charm'st us with thy soft and solemn hymn From battlement, or barn, or hay-stack trim: And now not seldom tun'st, as if for hire, Thy thrilling pipe to Me, waiting to catch The pittance due to thy well-warbled song. Sweet Bird, sing on! for oft near lonely hatch, Like Thee, myself have pleas'd the rustic throng; And oft, for entrance 'neath the peaceful thatch, Full many a tale have told, and ditty long. SONNET, WRITTEN AT A FARM. Around my porch and lowly casement spread The myrtle never sear, and gadding vine, With fragrant sweetbriar loves to intertwine; And in my garden 's box-encircled bed The pansie pied, the musk-rose, white and red, The pink and tulip, and honied woodbine, Fling odours round; the flaunting eglantine Decks my trim fence, 'neath which, by Silence led, The Wren hath wisely fram'd her mossy cell; And, far from noise in courtly land so rife, Nestles her young to rest and warbles well: Here in this safe retreat and peaceful glen I pass my sober moments, far from men, Nor wishing death too soon, nor asking life.

Empty the flask, discharg'd the score, Ned stagger'd from the tavern door, And falling, in his drunken fits, Crippled his nose and lost his wits; But, from the kennel soon emerging, His nose repairs by help of surgeon: That done, the leech peeps in his brain To find his Wits,—but peeps in vain. “'Tis hard,” the patient cries, “to lose “Wits not a whit the worse for use; “Wits which I always laid aside “For great occasions, cut and dried;” ('Tho' here the case was falsely put: His wits were dried, himself was cut.) “Wits like the Continental Aloe, “That for a century lies fallow; “Wits never prodigally wasted; “Like choice conserves, but rarely tasted: “Wits husbanded, not spent at random; “Cork'd up like cordials for my grandam: “Wits, which, if all your wealth could buy—sir, “You would not be a jot the wiser.” Tho' plain appear'd in ev'ry face A fellow-feeling of his case, Yet still, to shew their wits were sound, His boon companions throng around, And sagely, one and all, accost him; “Zounds, Ned! I wonder how you lost 'em!” Ah! let them drink their port in peace, For miracles will never cease! And, if Ned's loss of wits astound 'em, Zounds!—how they'll wonder when he 's found 'em! ADDRESS OF AN INDIAN GIRL TO AN ADDER. WRITTEN IN THE YEAR 1740, BY A SCHOLAR OF WINCHESTER COLLEGE. Stay, stay, thou lovely fearful Snake! Nor hide thee in yon darksome brake; But let me oft thy form review, Thy sparkling eyes, and golden hue: From thence a chaplet shall be wove To grace the youth I dearest love. Then, ages hence, when Thou no more Shalt glide along the sunny shore, Thy copied beauties shall be seen; Thy vermeil red and living green In mimic folds thou shalt display: Stay, lovely, fearful ADDER, stay!

Happiest of the insect throng, Who, the verdant bowers among Where the rose of richest hue, Crimson pink, and violet blue, By soft breath of Zephyr fann'd, Fling around their odours bland, Lov'st thy small melodious lip In the new-fall'n dew to dip: The amaranth, and eglantine, And all the fields produce is thine; All her treasures, all her stores, Nature for thy use explores: Thee the nymphs and swains revere, Golden Summer's harbinger!

Old Elwes once espied a Mouse In the Dry Corner of his house: While his relation, the late Colonel Tims, was visiting Mr. Elwes at his house at Marcham, in Berkshire, a heavy shower falling in the night, he found the rain dropping through the cieling upon his bed, on which he immediately rose and moved the bed from its place; he had, however, scarcely got into it again ere he found the same inconvenience recur and oblige him to have recourse a second time to the same experiment, which still proved ineffectual. At length, after having pushed his bed quite round the room, he gained a corner where the cieling was better secured, and there he slept till morning. When he encountered his host at breakfast, he told him what had happened.—“Aye, aye!” said the old gentlemen, seriously, “I don't mind it myself; but to those who do, that is “a nice Corner, in the rain.”—See the Life of John Elwes, Esq. page 13. And, though he had no cause to fear, “Curse you!” quoth he, “what do you here?” The Mouse indignant rais'd his head, And thus, but without passion, said: “No mouse alive would hither come “That had on earth another home. “'Tis not the risk we run, not that; “You ha'n't the heart to keep a cat. “Then traps we know, are never set, “And why? because you grudge the bait. “We 're in security, I grant, “But, safe from danger, die for want: “Tho' I should lodge here, why fear you? “When do you roast, or bake, or brew? “The Mouse that trusted to your shelf “Would soon grow leaner than Yourself: “For never a morsel did I see “To put to the test my honesty. “But I disdain, Sir, to intrude “After your speech so gross and rude; “And think not that I make pretence, “Upon my honour I'll go hence: “For in the rest of all your house “There's no fit lodging for a Mouse.” LINES ON THE LATE AMERICAN WAR.

EPIGRAM. Some of the Bread with which the French fed their prisoners of war, having been brought to this Country, was analyzed by the direction of Lord Grenville; and found to have been made of horse-beans, together with some ingredients of a coarser quality, mixed with a certain proportion of common Sand. Say why with Sand, instead of Wheat, France kneads her captive's crust?— 'Tis but to execute her threat: “My foes shall bite the dust.” IMPROMPTU, IN ADMIRATION OF THE DOWNY LUXURIANCE FAINTLY SHADOWING THE LOWER HEMISPHERE OF AN HEAVENLY COUNTENANCE. Saint Thomas Aquinas A celebrated teacher of school-divinity in the universities of Italy, about the middle of the thirteenth century, commonly called the Angelical Doctor. all angels supposes With beards are provided as well as with noses: Yet no text has been found to confirm what he saith, And make it an item of orthodox faith.— Sure to help a lame Saint o'er a stile is no sin! “You 'll find chapter and verse, Tom, on Caroline's chin.” MONODY ON THE DEATH OF DICK, AN ACADEMICAL CAT. —Mi-Cat inter omnes. —Hor. Carm. lib. i. ode 12. Ye Rats, in triumph elevate your ears! Exult, ye Mice!—for Fate's abhorred shears Of Dick's nine lives have slit the catguts nine Henceforth he mews 'midst choirs of Cats divine! Though nine successive lives protract their date, E'en Cats themselves obey the call of Fate; Whose formidable fiat sets afloat Mortals, and mortal Cats, in Charon's boat: Fate, who Cats, Dogs, and Doctors makes his prize That grace Great Britain's Universities. Where were ye, nymphs,—when to the silent coast Of gloomy Acheron Dick travell'd post? Where were ye, Muses, in that deathful hour?— Say, did ye haunt the literary bower Where Science sends her sons in stockings blue To barter praise for soup with Montague? Or point prepare for Boswel's anecdote, Or songs inspire, and fit 'em to his throat?— For not on Isis' classic shores ye stray'd, Nor brew'd with Cherwell's wave your lemonade; Nor assignations kept with grizzled elves, Where learning sleeps on Bodley's groaning shelves; Nor, where no poet glows with kindred fire, Wept o'er your favourite Warton's silent lyre. While venal Cats (leagued with degenerate curs, Of faded prudes the four-legg'd pensioners) On the soft sofa rang'd in order due, For eleemosynary muffin mew, Regardless of the meed that Fame bestows, Their tail a feather for each wind that blows; Thee, generous Dick, the Cat-controlling powers Ordain'd to mouse in academic bower's: Bade thee the sacred stream of sapience sip, And in Piërean cream thy whiskers dip! Enshrin'd celestial cateries among, The sable matron, from whose loins he sprung, Who traced her high descent through ages dark From Cats that caterwaul'd in Noah's Ark, Stern, brindled nurse, with unremitting care, To high achievements train'd her tabby heir; On patriot Cats his young attention fix'd, And many a cuff with grave instruction mix'd; Taught the great truth, to half his race unknown: “Cats are not kitten'd for themselves alone; “But hold from Heav'n their delegated claws, “Guardians of larders, liberties, and laws.” “Let Cats and Catlings of ignoble line “Slumber in bee-hive chairs, in dairies dine; “Shun thou the shades of Cat-enfeebling ease! “Watch o'er the weal of Rhedycinian cheese; “The melting marble of collegiate brawn “For heads of houses guard, and lords in lawn; “And keep each recreant rat and mouse in awe “That dares to shew his nose in Golgotha. Golgotha, “the place of a scull,” a name ludicrously appropriated to the place in which the Heads of Colleges assemble. “So may the brightest honours of the gown “Thy riper years and active virtue crown!— “Say, shall not cats, fraught with ethereal fire, Electrical sparks may be elicited by friction from a cat's back. “To seats of lettered eminence aspire?— “Caligula a consul made his steed; “What though the beast could neither write nor read, “Yet could he talents negative display, “And silence Opposition with his neigh. “If Charles of Sweden swore he would depute, “The senate to control, his old jack boot; “If modern taste a learned Pig reveres, “And pigs unlearn'd keep company with peers; The social porker here alluded to, is well known to have been the assiduous companion of Lord M?t Edg?'s excursions. “If erst Rome's papal crown a gossip wore, “Then, Dick, thou may'st become Vice-chancellor. “Might I but live, though crazy, old, and sick, “To see thee stalk behind thy beadles, Dick! “Behold, my brindled boy, with conscious pride “O'er convocated grizzle-wigs preside! “Hear thee, e'er I explore my latest home, “Confer degrees in Sheldon's spacious dome! “See thee in scarlet robe encase thy fur, “And at Saint Mary's venerably purr!— “Then let me be translated to the skies, “And close in welcome death these gooseb'ry eyes! “Yet think not, darling Dick, that fame allows “Her glorious palm, unearn'd, to grace thy brows: “By toil Herculean, and profound research, “Expect to thrive in politics or church! “The herd who worship at preferment's shrine “No servile task, no sacrifice, decline; “Courtiers for coronets their conscience pawn, “Clerks in prunello crawl, then soar in lawn. “See, with the riband grac'd and radiant star, “The chief that waged the Continental war! “Such palms diminish'd realms can yet afford “To patriotic H??e's protracting sword! “See Wilkes, entrusted with the City Key “Till he made fools of all the Livery! “See grov'ling S???? the wealth of India share: “He taught the Hindù race to feed on air! “Mark the career of Rhedycina's bard;— “Not such his toil, not such his vast reward. “Glean'd from antiquity's exhaustless mine, “He bade the gems of science brighter shine; “His care retriev'd each venerable name “Reft by Oblivion from the rolls of Fame, “And with new glory crown'd the strains sublime “That echoed from the harps of elder time. “'Twas his 'midst mouldering palms of chivalry, “To braid the deathless blooms of poesy; “On learning's gloom the rays of taste to pour, “And gild with genuine wit the social hour; “Affection and applause alike he shar'd; “All lov'd the man, all venerate the bard: “Ev'n Prejudice his fate afflicted hears, “And letter'd Envy sheds reluctant tears.— “Of genius, taste, philanthropy, and sense, “Candour and wit—behold the Recompence! “No sinecure, no venerable stall, “He fills, o'ercanopied with crimson pall; “No choir obsequious waits his dread commands, “Where supple vergers pace with silver wands; “Where soft reclines in velvet pomp supreme, “Divinity entranc'd in mitrous dream: “No coin his meed—for classic fobs unfit— “For, ah! what fellowship has wealth with wit! “Such worth the Laurel could alone repay, “Profan'd by Cibber, and contemn'd by Gray; On the death of Cibber, the place of Poet Laureate was offered by Lord John Cavendish, at the desire of the late Duke of Devonshire, then Lord Chamberlain, to Mr. Gray, who refused to accept it. See Mason's Memoirs of the Life and Writings of Gray. “Yet hence its wreath shall new distinction claim, “And, though it gave not, take from Warton fame.” While glory's steep ascent Grimalkin shews, Dick's breast with emulative ardour glows; His emerald eyes with richer radiance roll, And all the Cat awakens in his soul. Within the tender velvet of his paw, Though yet unbloodied, lurks each virgin claw, Anticipated palms his hope descries, And conquests gain'd o'er visionary mice: Though much for milk, more for renown he mews, And nobler objects than his tail pursues. O, could I call the Muses from their spheres To sing the triumphs of his riper years! What strife the larder's conscious shelves beheld! What congregated rats his valour quell'd! What mice descended, at each direful blow, To nibble brimstone in the realms below!— The victor, who his foes in furious mood Hurl'd from the Granic to the Stygian flood; Churchill, whose bounty fainting Frenchmen gave Soup-meagre gratis in the Danube's wave; Heathfield, whose red-hot vengeance Spain defied, Blist'ring, like Spanish flies, old Neptune's hide; Who plung'd his enemies, a whisker'd group, In green waves twice as hot as green pease' soup, While Fate on Calpe's summit sat and smil'd To see the dingy Dons like lobsters boil'd, Or by the lightning of the exploded shell Dispatch'd to seek a cooler birth in hell— All heroes, bloody, brave, or politic, All, all should yield pre-eminence to Dick: And everlasting laurels, thick as hops, Wreath their bright foliage round his brindled chops. Mysterious powers who rule the destinies Of conquerors and kings, of cats and mice, Why did your will the Pylian chief decree Three centuries, unspectacled, to see, Yet summon'd from his patriot toils away Illustrious Dick, before his beard was grey? Of valour, sense, or skill, how vain the boast!— Dick seeks the shades, an undistinguish'd ghost, And turns his tail on this terrestrial ball, Dismiss'd without Mandamus Medical; Sent, without purge or catapotium, In prime of cat-hood to the catacomb; No doctor fee'd, no regimen advis'd, Unpill'd, unpoultic'd, unphlebotomiz'd! Ye sage divines, if so concise our span, Who for preferment would turn Cat in pan? Since Clergymen and Cats one fate betides, And worms shall eat their sermons and their hides! Polecats, who Dick's disastrous end survive, Shall bless their stars that they still stink alive; Muskcats shall feel a melancholy qualm, And with their sweets departed Dick embalm; Cats in each clime and latitude that dwell, Brown, sable, sandy, grey, and tortoiseshell, Of titles obsolete, or yet in use, Tom, Tybert, Roger, Rutterkin, Rutterkin.—A cat of this name was cater-cousin to the great great great great great great great great great grandmother of Grimalkin; and first cat in the caterie of an old woman, who was tried for bewitching a daughter of the Countess of Rutland in the beginning of the sixteenth century. or Puss; Cats who with wayward hags the moon control, Unchain the winds, and bid the thunders roll; Brave in enchanted sieves the boist'rous main, And royal barks with adverse blasts detain; “Moreover she confessed, that she took a cat and christened it, &amp;c. &amp;c. and that in the night following, the said cat was conveyed in the middest of the sea by all these witches sayling in their riddles, or cives, and so left the said cat right before the towne of Leith in Scotland. This doone, there did arise such a tempest at sea, as a greater hath not been seen, &amp;c.” “Againe it is confessed, that the said christened Cat was the cause of the Kinges Majestie's shippe, at his comming forthe of Denmarke, had a contrarie winde to the rest of the shippes then beeing in his companie, which thing was most straunge and true, as the Kinges Majestie acknowledgeth, for when the rest of the shippes had a fair and goode winde, then was the winde contrarie and altogether against his Majestie, &amp;c.” Old Pamphlet entitled, “Newes from Scotland, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.” Printed in the year 1591, by William Wright. Nay, Two-legg'd Cats, as well as Cats with four, Shall Dick's irreparable loss deplore. Cats who frail nymphs in gay assemblies guard, As buckram stiff, and bearded like the pard; Calumnious Cats who circulate faux pas, And reputation maul with murd'rous claws; Shrill Cats whom fierce domestic brawls delight, Cross Cats who nothing want but teeth to bite, Starch Cats of puritanic aspect sad, And learned Cats who talk their husbands mad; Confounded Cats who cough, and croak, and cry, And maudlin Cats who drink eternally; Prim Cats of countenance and mien precise, Yet oft'ner hankering for men than mice; Curst Cats whom nought but castigation checks, Penurious Cats who buy their coals by pecks, Fastidious Cats who pine for costly cates, And jealous Cats who catechise their mates; Cat-prudes who, when they're ask'd the question, squall, And ne'er give answer categorical; Uncleanly Cats who never pare their nails, Cat-gossips full of Canterbury tales, Cat-grandams vex'd with asthmas and catarrhs, And superstitious Cats who curse their stars; Cats who their favours barter for a bribe, And canting Cats, the worst of all the tribe! And faded virgin Cats, and tabbies old, Who at quadrille remorseless mouse for gold; Cats of each class, craft, calling, and degree Mourn Dick's calamitous catastrophe. Yet, while I chant the cause of Richard's end, Ye sympathizing Cats, your tears suspend! Then shed enough to float a dozen whales, And use, for pocket-handkerchiefs, your tails!— Fame says (but Fame a sland'rer stands confess'd,) Dick his own sprats, like Bamber Gascoigne, dress'd: But to the advocates of truth 'tis known, He neither staid for grace nor gridiron. Raw sprats he swore were worth all fish beside, Fresh, stale, stew'd, spitchcock'd, fricasseed, or fried: Then swallow'd down a score without remorse, And three fat mice slew for his second course: But, while the third his grinders dyed with gore, Sudden those grinders clos'd—to grind no more! And (dire to tell!) commission'd by old Nick, A catalepsy made an end of Dick. Thus from the pasty's furious escalade, Where blood, to gravy turn'd, embrown'd his blade, (That all-encountering blade which scorn'd to fear Broil'd gizzards charg'd with Kian-gunpowder) From rais'd crust levell'd never more to rise, From ducks dispatch'd, and massacred minc'd pies, From turkey-poults transfix'd, and sirloins slash'd, From marrow-puddings maul'd, and custards quash'd, Crimpt cod, and mutilated mackarel, And desolation of the turtle's shell Some Alderman of giant appetite A surfeit sweeps to everlasting night: Imbibing claret with his latest breath, And brandishing his knife and fork in death, Downward a gormandizing ghost he goes, And bears to hell fresh fuel on his nose; For Calipash explores the infernal scene, ? Petit Ille dapes, ? Oraque vana movet, dentemque in dente fatigat, Exercetque cibo delusum gutter inani, Proque epulis tenues nequicquàm devorat auras. Ovid. Met. lib. viii. And wishes Phlegethon one vast Terrene. O Paragon of Cats, whose loss distracts My soul, and turns my tears to cataracts, Nor craft nor courage could thy doom prorogue! Dick, premier Cat upon the catalogue Of Cats that grace a caterwauling age, Scar'd by Fate's cat-call quits this earthly stage; Dire fled the arrow that laid Richard flat, And sickening Glory saw Death shoot a Cat. Ah! though thy bust adorn no sculptur'd shrine, No vase thy relics rare to fame consign, No rev'rend characters thy rank express, Nor hail thee, Dick! D. D. nor F. R. S. Though no funereal cypress shade thy tomb, For thee the wreaths of Paradise shall bloom. There, while Grimalkin's mew her Richard greets, A thousand Cats shall purr on purple seats: E'en now I see, descending from his throne, Thy venerable Cat, O Whittington! The kindred excellence of Richard hail, And wave with joy his gratulating tail! There shall the worthies of the whisker'd race Elysian Mice o'er floors of sapphire chase, Midst beds of aromatic marum stray, Or raptur'd rove beside the Milky Way. Kittens, than Eastern Houris fairer seen, Whose bright eyes glisten with immortal green, Shall smooth for tabby swains their yielding fur, And to their amorous mews assenting purr. There, like Alcmena's, shall Grimalkin's son In bliss repose,—his mousing labours done, Fate, envy, curs, time, tide, and traps defy, And caterwaul to all eternity! END OF VOL. I.</field>

Le plus saint devoir de l'homme est l'insurrection. La Fayette. This shews how perfectly the Rump And Commonwealth together jump; For as a fly that goes to bed Rests with his tail above his head: So, in this mongrel state of ours, The rabble are the supreme powers. Butler. TOPSY TURVY. Man is but a topsy-turvy animal, his head where his heels should be. Swift. Old England is ill at her ease, She a surfeit has got, I can tell ye; And the cause of Old England's disease Is the pudding and beef in her belly: To the French for relief she applies, And their Politic Doctors assure her, That they know where her malady lies, And their Grand Panacea shall cure her. “Ah! what Panacéa so grand “Can my old constitution repair?— Why, dame! on your head you must stand, And kick up your heels in the air: Then your health will be equal and good, Nothing else can from ruin preserve ye: For Equality, well understood, Means to turn all the world topsy-turvy. Our counsel you never can say 'tis Like that of your medical elves, Since you find that we offer you gratis The prescription we follow ourselves: Its blest operation you 've seen, So 'tis plain that it never miscarries; And you long in the habit have been Of adopting the fashions of Paris. Behold our Republican State To perfection advancing apace, Ever since, where the Head stood of late, We 've erected the Tail in its place! All distinctions we nobly despise, Yet who views our Convention must own us A groupe who all merits comprize, And each member “rex et sutor bonus.” There's Pethion first on the lists Of Levellers stands with good reason: He can shew you that wisdom consists In burglary, outrage and treason; His logic will make it out plain That allegiance and duty a farce is; And dignity none can retain But rogues without rags to their ?. Robespierre, most renown'd desperado, Next claims your profound admiration; Who empties the veins like Sangrado, Phlebotomist chief of the nation: He laments, while a weasand is whole, That his blade should inactive remain; And (like Macedon's lord o'er his bowl) Swears that thrice he would slaughter the slain. In committing to Danton the seals We have shewn ourselves wiser than you are; For whenever the state 's out at heels We 've a farrier provided to shoe her: He was nurst in the shambles 'tis known, And now practises slaughter afresh, To prove “What is bred in the bone “Will never be out of the flesh.” There's Gorsas who well ascertains Of relative rights the extent, Since he beat out his old father's brains Who begot him without his consent. Escap'd from the Wheel heretofore, At the gallies he serv'd his probation; His proficiency prov'd at the oar, He's advanc'd to the helm of the nation. Marat, whom all ruffians applaud, Will to slaughter or robbery lead 'em; This tergiverse Champion of fraud Shall extend the dominion of freedom: Tho' our credit (with Cambon's good care) As threadbare is worn as our coats, Tho' with famine we groan, and despair, Marát can soon alter our notes. See Merlin, preceptor of youth, Exemplify filial affection; Bright pattern of honour and truth, The cement of nuptial connection! See rev'rend Chabot too conspire To accomplish our regeneration: That adulterous capuchin friar Shall teach us to flee fornication. Atheistic Dupont for his pains, With honour 'tis fit we should mention; This globe of the world, he maintains, Made itself like our Gallic Convention: So, to prove ourselves creatures of chance, We determine, and none shall gainsay us, By disorganization of France To establish the empire of Chaos: What guerdon shall Carra reward Whose fame self-acknowledg'd we dwell on? Who, for burglary doom'd to the cord A true philosophical felon, Now prescribes to reformers a plan Of morality new and uncommon; And the rights imprescriptive of man Ascertains by the pillage of woman. Egalite's retrogade worth Surpasses all praise or rehearsal, By scoundrels of ocean and earth Unrivall'd—poltroon universal! All jacobin murderers own His precedence, and hail him “Tu Brute!” While nearness in blood to the throne Makes regicide relative duty. Thus you see in how striking a light True merit we strive to exhibit, When our Senators sage we invite From the gallies, the forge, and the gibbet: And of equal desert we can boast Legislators, some hundreds or more, Who with reason, you'll own, rule the roast; They were, half of 'em, turnspits before. At your folly mankind will exclaim If you share not the fruit of our labours, With the sparks of our patriot-flame While we freely enlighten our neighbours. From these sparks you may kindle a blaze, If fann'd by some notable fellows, And a grand conflagration you'll raise Let but Priestley and Paine blow the bellows. Even now is your church undermin'd With Priestley's polemical nitre: Which, exploded, you'll presently find The red night-cap take place of the mitre. As sure as his regimen works, From old orthodox leaven 'twill purge ye; And of Hebrews, Dissenters, and Turks, Make right apostolical clergy. Strike the flint of his heart on the steel Of freedom; lawn sleeves be the tinder: Well brimstone your match with his zeal, And again make St. Paul's a huge cinder: Rare news for the Shade of good Price! With joy he will sing like a throstle: So let Perigord post with advice, To exhilarate Freedom's Apostle. Then serve up a dish piping hot Of the calves heads that govern the nation; And reviving Guy Vaux's old plot, By murder effect reformation: Lords and Commons exalt to the skies, Taught by Priestley new flights of devotion, When both Houses together shall rise, And each member at once make a motion. His Birmingham thunder shall 'wake Those blind watchmen your bishops suffragan, And the pillars of monarchy shake; Paine calls it the Temple of Dagon: Like a Sampson he lustily strains To pull down that pile Antichristian, Which shall tumble, and beat out the brains Of each aristocratic Philistine. For instruction repair to Paine's school, And observe what a picture he'll draw, Of a Brother of Mahomet's Mule, Call'd “The Church as establish'd by Law;” By the Hierarchy 'got on the State That with fishes and loaves loads his crupper, While Sectaries squint at the bait, And get nothing but kicks for their supper. Nor believe the assertion that those Who would level the altar and throne, Who all faith and allegiance oppose, No religion can have of their own: For David describ'd long ago Some lambs of this very same fold, Whose religion was Rapine, I trow, Since “their idols were silver and gold.” Some say that with coin to supply us, The spoils of the church we engross, And as for our churchmen so pious, Neither pile we have left them, nor cross; But 'tis false.—The true church we restore By our confiscatorial process; And her sons, like the Christians of yore, We make them all take up their crosses. What! shall prelates or nobles forsooth In fine cloaths shew their insolent riches, And basely oppose naked truth By Philosophers taught without breeches! No!—Let us of raiment bereave All aristocratical sots, For our ancestors, Adam and Eve, Were, at first, like ourselves, Sans-Culottes But, no longer in Innocence dress'd, When they courted the fig-leaf's protection, And green breeches put on, 'tis confess'd They were fall'n from their pristine perfection. Then survey Us so dauntless and bare, Nor dispute the perfection we claim, Who rival the primitive pair, Unincumber'd with Breeches or Shame. If our counsel with scorn is repaid We shall bring an old house o'er your ears; At our bidding, to swallow your trade, All Europe shall send privateers: Tippoo Sultan your factors shall dread; When back'd by French blades he shall fix a Huge price on each Englishman's head In Bengal, in Bahàr, and Orixa. Our ordnance affright'ning the Tagus Shall ring a Republican peal; We'll make Lisbon one grand Sarcophágus And plunder the mines of Brazil. We'll nip the Dutch navy in Zealand, On their demi-despotic Stadhólder Set the Patriots, his guilders to steal and The head that looks over his shoulder. Batavia we next will attack, To Ceylon we'll establish our claim: Fed on spices wash'd down with arrack, How fiercely French courage will flame! Our Dráwcansirs none shall escape, Fleets and armies we'll fit out by dozens, Expel the Mynheers from the Cape, And fratérnize our Hottentot Cousins. In the silks which Italians export Shall our shirtless Philosophers shine; While for Rome, that idolatrous court, Our new priests have a tickler in brine: We'll shew the poor fools, who confide in Infallible brains that are addle, Evangelic Democracy 'striding Superstition's old Catholic saddle. Should Spain to the Bourbons prove true From the Dons their mustachios we'll crop, Spoil Mexico, pillage Peru, And spend all the gold in their shop; All around us, east, west, north, and south, Insurrection and anarchy foster, Sail to Hell with the winds in our mouth, Nor care three-pence for Libs, Notus, Auster. That the good of mankind we've in view Our extreme moderation denotes: Then French tenets embrace, or, morbleu! We'll invade you and cut all your throats. In the teeth of the tower of London Hurl the Head of your King in defiance, His beef-eaters knock ev'ry one down, And enfranchise hyænas and lions. To perfection as yet never reach'd The world 's in a state of progression, Heretofore, like our patriots, unbreech'd, Soon 'twill swagger at years of discretion; While the nations, enlighten'd, agree To propagate rapine and slaughter, Blest scyons of Liberty's Tree, Which We plant, and the Devil will water. BUBBLE AND SQUEAK, A GALLI-MAUFRY OF BRITISH BEEF, FIRST PUBLISHED IN JUNE, 1799. WITH THE CHOPP'D CABBAGE OF GALLIC PHILOSOPHY, AND RADICAL REFORM. ? Liberius si Dixero quid, si forte jocosius: hoc mihi juris Cum venia dabis. Hor. S. lib. i. Sat. 4. BUBBLE AND SQUEAK. Bards, in remotest ages born E'er grandsire Jove his beard had shorn, Taught by the Muse, whene'er they chose, To Heav'n were wont to soar like crows; But they have left us no memorial To prove their flights were flights corporeal: Hence we the volant part suspect To have been Nous, or Intellect, While body snug on earth kept house After his own inventions, Nous, Ere his material comrade miss'd him, Scamper'd above the solar system: Heav'n's King no sooner sent a summons To his celestial Lords and Commons, Than close upon the rear of each, Nous flew to hear his gracious speech; The consequent address he noted, What patriot Gods th' amendment voted, What Goddess made Olympus' portal Eccho the din of lungs immortal. Jove's parliament but ill accords With ours,—we boast an House of Lords, Who, to assist in their decisions Admit no lady politicians, Though their good lordships all connive at Ladies who legislate in private: But in the regions over-head Divinities are better bred: Heav'n's courtesy the petticoat Admits in parliament to vote, Bills to prefer, and in long speeches Challenge pre-eminence of breeches. From stock of male and female orator, Here Nous his budget fill'd memoritèr; Then in a trice to earth he stole, Freighted with news for Jobbernol, His sleeping partner, a muckworm, a Dull dog, who stuck to Terra Firma, And made it his grand occupation To give the tidings circulation. Hence Homer, Hesiod, and Lucian Treat us with such divine confusion, While Gods above and Gods below In hotbed verse like mushrooms grow: Cupids display their bows and quivers, And Naiads, flound'ring in the rivers, Braid their dank locks with cress and sedges; And Dryads peer through hawthorn hedges. 'Neath branching elms in shady vales Lascivious Satyrs whisk their tails; Fauns breakfast upon hips and haws, And Woodnymphs make with Pan faux pas. Here Mermaids press their liquid pillows, And sing to sleep the growling billows; Or make the ravish'd whales they chaunt to In the churn'd ocean dance coranto. With canzonettas and capricci's Siren's catch dilettanti fishes; With melting voice and wily looks Allure john-dories to their hooks: And scate, and sentimental sturgeon, To list their dulcet song emerging; Bid pilchards and elastic grigs Frisk to Scotch reels and Irish jigs; Crabs caper to melodious rhyme, And lobsters with their tails beat time; Eels circumvolving quit their holes To shew they've music in their souls; Cod-fish, with gills expanded wide, In cadence to the kettle glide, And soals come leaping to be fried. And, as the strain harmonious swells, Enamour'd oysters ope their shells, To please each chauntress fair and fickle: Who some would eat and some would pickle.— The Heav'n taught Bards of whom I speak When time was young, in crabbed Greek, Th' achievements of celestial legions Detail'd among these lower regions. The strains which rais'd Them to renown, Into plain English melted down, Make of each school-boy rhetorician A prodigy of erudition; Who manufacturers prose too good To be endur'd or understood, And verse that emulates thy lay, Jack Sprat! or thine, Jack Holliday! In courts, cathedrals, armies, navies, A blockhead's now a “rara avis:” This is no extraordinary fact is, For who'd the self-denial practise That goes to constitute a dunce, Where youths can eat and learn at once? At once in wisdom grow and stature By batt'ning upon literature? Where league 'twixt belly 's form'd and head By alphabet of gingerbread; Whose erudition appertains To chitterlings as well as brains, Which boys, whom matrons sage commend, Digest before they comprehend: Dry-nurses, and Doctores blandi Instruction blend with sugar-candy; Puerile propensities discerning, Make the red-lane the road to learning; With spice and treacle in alliance They mould the elements of science; Economists of birch, cajole us With many a literary bolus, Whose more refin'd ingredients gain A lodgement in the pericrane, And would full oft betray our fancies To literate extravagancies, If not prevented, ere we grow men, By Ballast-learning in abdomen. Hence school-boys scout the birchen tree: That weed of aristocracy, So many ages misapplied, No longer wounds tyronic hide.— In these enlighten'd days is birch Preparative for state or church? No.—Let us be no more beguil'd By “spare the rod and spoil the child,” Nor heed the cry of surly Sam: Who tells us—tho' 'tis all a flam— “Boy's heads, where flagellation fails, Discharge the ransom of their tails.” Though Greek and Latin heretofore Were in request, they're now a bore. We skim, from abstract and translation, The cream of classic information: Like cream from London cows translated, Or butter-milk sophisticated. What lad of spirit cares a groat, How Diomed and Ajax fought, While at each other hurl defiance The sons of pugilistic science; Who on black eyes and bloody nose Read lectures to our Bond-street beaux; Instruct clerks-militant and laymen To spar with coal-heavers and draymen; Make lords and crop-ear'd petit-maitres Their prowess prove on tavern waiters; Challenge their corn-cutter and taylor To arms, and catch contagious valour From contact with each ragamuffin. Big Ben, Mendoza, and the Ruffian.— Who with Demosthenes or Tully The lining of his skull would sully, While Demagogues of mickle worth At Anniversaries hold forth? While T??rn?y, Gr????n, G??y, and J?k??l, E?sk??e, law's cock, its Chicken Michael, Import their flow'rs of elocution From Gallic soil of Revolution; And make our Youth of all conditions Turn democratic rhetoricians, And prove in politics as knowing As those who set their tongues a going? Lo! where, pot-valiant, they attack The Minister behind his back, Who, they'll be sworn, usurp'd the helm On purpose to undo the realm; In John Bull's cushion planted thorns, And took him roundly by the horns (Was ever Beast serv'd such a trick!) When he was prancing to Old Nick: Who clapp'd a padlock on his muzzle, Maugre F?x, L??d??d?le, and R????l, When, seiz'd like other horned cits With revolutionary fits, Amidst his disaffected swarm He bellow'd treason at Chalk Farm! But to return from whence we started:— Though knowledge by old books imparted In th' estimate is mouldy grown Of those who have too much o' their own: (Just as the sun's illustrious splendour's An eye-sore to our candle-venders For each dark spot upon his face Who'd plant a thousand in its place, With long succession of eclipses Bronze his complexion like a gypsy's, And bid in fogs his beams lie fallow So 'twould but raise the price of Tallow:) Still he who patiently explores Old erudition's classic stores, Whose steps from fashion's heights decline To trace the depths of learning's mine, Tho' cart-loads of black-letter'd lumber Its tracts voluminous encumber, Some text may light on, or narration That's pregnant with edification. As in old miser's cabinet, With cobwebs fring'd, by worms half eat, Bright guineas lurk, or gems that sparkle Within its private draw'r or dark hole. Thus, while the feats of those tall fellows He reads, the offspring of dame Tellus, Who brav'd the ruler of the sky, Th' observer sees, with half an eye, The fabling seers anticipate Philosophy of modern date, Who by profession's bound, and calling Authority to combat all in; Whose giant-appetite devours Thrones, principalities, and powers, Establishments delights in munching; Takes a cathedral for its luncheon, And kindly condescends to sate It's hunger on communion plate, Chalice, or consecrated flagon Like Wantley's sacrilegious Dragon. A true philosopher and sound, Who ravag'd all the country round, Effecting its regeneration By Gallic modes of desolation.— Let then Refinement's seminaries, From tales of cocks and bulls and fairies Revert to that abandon'd page, Whence arch-rebellion's pristine rage Our democratic youths enlightens, And bids them emulate the Titans: For these, like Fayette, the perfection Of duty plac'd in Insurrection, And (while the fervours Sieyes felt Glow'd underneath each giant's belt) To sweep down all distinctions strove And make a citizen of Jove— For Majesty, whom, while a child, Sceptres and globes and crowns beguil'd, Disdain'd, since he of age was grown, His gilded cradle of a throne; And had from thence transferr'd his state To ev'ry ragamuffin pate, Wherein, if any brains be found, He turn'd 'em round and round and round, Till, (as the legion-spirit stirr'd To ecstacy the infuriate herd,) He drove them headlong to the sea Of overwhelming anarchy. They swore it was a monstrous thing The thund'rer should be call'd Heav'n's King! The Imprescriptive Rights of giants They knew:—so bade him bold defiance; Vow'd his supremacy to level And with his gods to play the devil: Intrinsic sov'reignty, they said, Exists but in the governed, Who're bound to wage 'gainst governors Eternal, internecine wars: And, since 'twas their “sublime vocation” T' effect Heav'n's disorganization, Wherefore should their enormous brood (Miscall'd “the Swinish Multitude,”) That monstrous mass of eye-less matter Vouchsafe Omnipotence to flatter? Why, subject to th' Almighty's yoke, Should fane aspire or altar smoke? Let energy of bold emprize Spread revolution through the skies; From his high throne, in ruin hurl'd, Dash the Disposer of the world; And bid ferment with freedom's leaven The aristocracy of Heaven! Behold Typhœus, horrid form, Foremost advance the impious storm, The features mar of Nature's face, Make Ossa Pelion's mighty base; Then mount astride their apex high, Like rising scum of Anarchy!— Enceladus at Pallas launch Whole forests torn up root and branch As easily as the great Nation Tears up all sacred obligation! Porphyrion, Rhœcus, sturdy Mimas, Burn temples and abolish high mass; And humble ev'ry mitred nob In vile prostration to the Mob: The Mob, before whose fierce bravadoes, E'en philosophic reformadoes, Fell desolation's work pursuing, Quake at the storm themselves are brewing. Mob Royal, and his royal Cubs, The majesty of spades, and clubs, Drays, dung-carts, besoms, mops, and matches; Hamlet's gaunt king of shreds and patches. Whose awful mandate says express: Let people, nations, languages, My potent sov'reignty adore, As they, of old, fell down before The idol of th' Assyrian king; Just such another senseless thing: Though here my simile runs cross, Since his was gold, our Idol's dross. Oh had success but crown'd these Hectors, And giv'n Olympus Five Directors, (For just so many rebel pates Venusium's Bard enumerates.) Our Whig Club, had it then existed, Would, in their quarrel, have enlisted: For Whigs they were, of the old leaven, Who first made breach of peace in Heaven: And what do Whigs of modern days But kindle wild sedition's blaze? Expectant, in the contest's issues, Themselves to seize those loaves and fishes Which they can never hope to bite, While honest men enjoy their right: As pettifogger's dirty wiles Set John a Nokes on Tom a Stiles, To prove, by desp'rate course of law, His title to a barley straw; Reckless of a whole country's curses, So they can drain the loobies' purses. But Jove, to keep these rebels under, Unlock'd his magazine of thunder. Launch'd his avenging bolts, and sear'd, With lightning's flash, Rebellion's beard. Here Juno down Olympus' staircase Kick'd sturdy Mimas' recreant carcase: Here Pallas threw away her distaff And crack'd Typhœus' skull with his staff: Apollo there, with shaft unerring, Porphyrion slew dead as a herring: Here Vulcan strives to find in vain, With his sledge-hammer, Rhœcus' brain: Here Jove Enceladus o'erwhelms, Who, with up-rooted oaks and elms, Brought to the proof celestial patience, And cudgell'd all the constellations; Put the spheres' music out of tune, Swore he'd eject the man i' the moon; Though a fine fellow of his inches, He'd fire his bush, eat up his green-cheese, His claret, at a sup, absorb it, And fustigate him round his orbit.— But Jove resolv'd the braggadocio Should ne'er from this time forth his nose shew; So gave him salt eel for his supper, And pil'd Mount Ætna on his crupper. Pent underneath his mountain tomb A living death's tremendous doom The prostrate swagg'rer undergoes; Yet still with wonted rage he glows. Oppress'd with more than mortal pain He writhes and strives to rise in vain, And, bellowing in despair and ire, Black bile commix'd with sulph'rous fire Disgorges: through th' incumbent load Bursting, th' imprison'd flames explode, To Heav'n renew'd defiance bear, And tell the Gods who sent 'em there.— Fam'd Orator of Palace yard, Thy melting eyes O lend the Bard! Lend him thy bowels of compassion, And pathos of the newest fashion, To wail, with sympathizing grief, The fall of each Insurgent Chief; For when a rank arch-rebel dies, In F?x's civic eulogies, (Like homely jade by beauty-washes, Or sugar-candy from molasses), Regen'rated, transform'd, refin'd, He soars, the noblest of his kind, Heroes and demigods among; A gilded fly from ordure sprung. Hung be the Shakspeare's bar with black Stript off an undertaker's back! The club's conven'd.—Yield day to night! Waiter!—but half the candles light; And half of that same half snuff out! Enlighten'd Whigs can dine without. Cold be the cod-fish, cold the sirloin! The claret not worth two-pence sterling, The punch of brandy void and lemon, The soup black broth of Lacedemon, The beef steaks scorch'd, the oysters stinking, The port fit for the Devil's drinking! Half boil'd too let the pudding come A mealy waste without a plumb! And let Dutch herrings shed their pickle In sympathy with tears that trickle Down Opposition cheeks and noses, While F?x, his friend's apotheósis Proclaims, the solitary herald Of all thy virtues, fell F???g????d! To kind oblivion loth to trust Defunct Rebellion's sacred dust!— So hails the Democratic strain, Philosophy, thy patriot reign! So sound the lore, so pure the theme Of thine inebriate académe! Philosophy!—Not Thou of old Heav'n-born to bless an age of gold; Whose penetrating glance descried The bounds which right from wrong divide, And on the wretch indignant frown'd Who dar'd those contraries confound; Philosophy, at whose command Fled Anarchy and Strife the land, Peace rais'd her olive-circled brow, And Plenty bloom'd on ev'ry bough; Benignant at whose side enthron'd, Religion her fair Sister own'd: While both their institutes combin'd To humanize and bless mankind.— Far other characters arise! Far other prospects court our eyes! Philosophy revers'd we view, Not of the Old School but the New. Philosophy, which sets at nought All that was dear and sacred thought, And leaves for probity no room In this world or the world to come: Here decollates as useless lumber, There dooms it to Eternal Slumber. Philosophy, of curst extraction, Whom Infidelity and Faction Evok'd from midnight darkness Stygian To plunder, and proscribe Religion, And half th' insensate globe ensnare With hollow smile and tinsel's glare: As Paphos' Sov'reign meretricious Rose from the sea so fair and specious, Yet, spite of all that lovers swore, And poets lied, was but a wh?. Philosophy, inveterate foe Of order, truth, and peace below, Whose rancour never can be spent 'Till each rever'd establishment, Ecclesiastical and civil, Shall be sent packing to the Devil. Philosophy, whose grasping hands Spit tythe pigs, seize upon glebe lands, Rob churchmen of their Christmas pye, Dispatch their brawn and rosemary; Beneath the cloyster's hallow'd floor Burrow, to sap their cellar door, And broach their casks of mellow'd juices, Long set apart for pious uses.— Philosophy, of Gallic climes, Parent of unexampled crimes! Philosophy, who, while she clouds Bright Revelation's day, unshrouds Dark-lantern of Regeneration, That Will-o'-wisp of the Great Nation, Whose glimmering sparkles emanate From rotten pediment o' the state; Just as stale fish and carrion trash is Known to emit electric flashes. But if perception's door be shut, And density of occiput Chance to make inadmissible Her Gallic Darkness Visible, Philosophy shall crack the pate To let it in at any rate; And all who dare to shut their eyes 'Gainst its dim gleam Septemberize, Or guillotine the dogs by shoals Only for being blind as moles; Or, if they venture to beseech Her pity, drown 'em all and each; Or cut the varlets throats, or gibbet 'em On Tree of Liberty ad libitum, Where influence blest of Gallic sky Their dark Aristocratic dye May bleach to pure Democracy. Philosophers! ye grand empirics! Had I the gift, in sounding lyrics, I'd spread your praise from clime to clime, And soar above this scurvy rhyme; Who fractious patients bring to reason By quaint incisions of the weazon: Who dose with Exile to Guiana, Instead of Ipecacuanha, To cleanse from contumacious matter The vitals of the Legislature: Administer, to cure all ills, Your grand specific, leaden pills, Which purge us of Aristocrats, Had they as many lives as cats, And unconcern'd to Charon's steerage Consign our hierarchy and peerage; Send them, where—, hous'd in their last home, The Kings of Brentford and of Rome, Where Numa, Romulus, and Ancus, Hippocrates and Saltinbancoes, Where vermin catchers, law expounders, Retailers of stale jokes and flounders, And those incorrigible curs, Conveyancing Biographers, And knight's o' the pad who rob and stop men, Mayors, marquisses, and Monmouth shop-men, Tapsters, and conventicle praters, Gospel, and gin-sophisticators; Quest mongers and quodlibetarians, Varlets who set mankind at variance; Numskulls, and critics sharp as needles, Phlebotomists, and parish beadles, Gallic director, and dog stealer, Bear leader, brawn and sturgeon dealer, Chiropodist and Cambrian squire All toast their cheese at the same fire.— There your Whitehaven collier's soul Must find itself at home t' a hole, Who to the Lord has sworn allegiance O' the secular infernal regions; Serv'd an apprenticeship to night, And darkness chose rather than light, Since, deep as it may chance to go, He's still but in the Shades Below. There, from terrestrial stage dismiss'd, Bravo descends, and pugilist; And not unsuitably with thém mix The sable corps of fierce Polemics, For, though the sacred statutes warn all 'Gainst putting trust in weapons carnal. Sturdy Polemics care not three-pence, But fight with pens, their carnal weapons. No mortal blood these weapons drink 'Tis true, but charge of mortal ink, That black combustible, let fly I' the cause of type or mystery; And those who wield 'em, not content To maim th' opposer's argument, Traduce his character, call names, And doom him to eternal flames.— What rage impels grave theologians To loggerheads like Greeks and Trojans! What frenzy makes of rev'rend grandsires Ecclesiastical drawcansirs!— Discretion's to Polemic Courage The same as pepper to pease porridge; Which, when 'tis eat unpepper'd, gripes With flatulency mortal tripes; And sets the chitterlingian clan At variance in our inward man; Where, as our tubes intestine soak, Porridge excites pneumatic croak, Tuning to base or treble key 'em; And discord fills peritonéum: Thus Zeal, not pepper'd with discretion, To the evangelical profession Noxious alike, has often rent The bowels of th' Establishment: Each varying blast of doctrine vain Inflames her disputatious train; Oft vex her frame intestine drubs, And military mulligrubs; And controversial cholic wrings Our Mother Church's chitterlings.— What 's worse—this pestilent explosion Of controversy puts in motion The spawn of Godwin and Tom Paine; Who tell their dupes that worldly gain Is the true cause which sets by th' ears Her venerable cavaliers. That, while they “Orthodoxy” bawl, They're squinting at Prebendal Stall; While they protest “our Faith 's in danger,” Pant for preferment's rack and manger.— This too Dissenters sets agog, Who, hank'ring for the Church's prog, And, sour'd with spleen, are ever ready To scandalize the good Old Lady: These fain would jealousies create Betwixt her and her spouse, the state: “Who 's bound in duty to discard her “Because she excludes them from her larder, “And keeps for her own pamper'd chits “Her dainty morsels and tid-bits.”— This is th' offence and stone of stumbling That sets their godly gizzards grumbling: Hence, mad with spleen, Sectarian Shrews Lay halters in her desks and pews; O'erleap her pale, her pastures forage, And ratsbane strew beside her porridge; With lunatic bans stun and fright her, Threat'ning with Unitarian nitre T' involve, in sudden conflagration, Her ancient orthodox foundation. Hence, as his pockets empty grow, Sectary, by inverse ratio, Presuming his idea-case Is full of inward light and grace, Concludes to hide would be a scandal The flame of Reformation-candle Beneath a bushel or a bed; So from brass candlestic, his head, Makes hypocritical pretence Illumination to dispense, And light us to discern each rent And wrinkle of th' establishment. Pious munificence arraigns, Vows betwixt benefice and brains He cannot find the least conjunction, But (so debas'd each sacred function!) That cauliflower wig the wearer Serves for a cloud t' envelop error; Short cassoc's figleaf to defect And nakedness of intellect; And blocks from timber-yards and quarries Are symbols of church dignitaries. Sectarians thus the church assail, (Losers are privileg'd to rail) And sacrilegiously make sport Of Grizzle-wig and Cassoc short; While churchmen the false charge repel, And could, if it were true, as well: For if tall greyhounds useless grown May into terriers be cut down; If beards of kings make jerkins' trimming, And superanuate wits old women; If wig that grac'd a judge's nob Moult to an under-sheriff's bob; And if, oblivious of its buckle, That bob to serve a shoe-black truckle; If spirit, as deep mystics state, To body may coagulate; If Lords may dwindle into Jews, Jack-boots degenerate to shoes, As Henley taught.—Can it surprise ye Should spruce Incumbent (versâ vice) A blunderbuss already, ánon Be metamorphos'd to a Canon: Since the transition is no more Than from a less t' a greater bore. But straight-hair'd Sectaries uncivil, And whigs mendacious, who speak evil Of dignities and Dignitaries, (No favour sure to find in théir eyes, If we admit Saint Jude's opinion,) Go farther and despise dominion. Loud murmurers, complainers these are, Intolerant of Church and Cæsar: At Shakspeare dinners fearless feeders With parliamentary seceders: Predicted mockers of the last time, Who of authority make pastime, And preach to Democratic herds Resistance, with great swelling words: “System of terror Robespierrëal,— “Freedom's sad exile, death and burial— “Despotic bills to quell sedition “Abhor'd by virtuous Opposition,— “The Sov'reign People—Age of Reason— “Pure Guilt—and Patriotic Treason,”— Bid them take State and Church by storm, Then: Hey, for Radical Reform!!!— As, when “Revenge, Timotheus cried,” And maudlin Greeks electrified, His strains inspir'd ferocious joy, And zeal to level and destroy: Such furious joy the Factious feel, Such transports of destructive zeal Inflame the disaffected swarm, At sound of Radical Reform.— To Radical Reform ye Whigs Carouse till ye get drunk as pigs! Applaud it with accordant throats Ye Corresponding Sans-Culottes! With acclamations, three times three, Toast it ye Lords of high degree With whom no sense of shame prevails!— Ye H?w?rds, R?ss?ls, L??d??d?les! Whose wisdom it may well beseem To lave your honours in the stream Of foul sedition,—and, with those Who eulogize their country's foes, (Those patriot-ranters, and true Trojans, O Connor's bosom friends and Grogan's,) Conjoin'd, like birds of the same feather, Swear that you'll live and die together.— Who shall presume to analyse What patriot peers so highly prize, Of Radical Reform make known The blessed operation?—Stone. Didst thou not, Stone: the doctrine hear Promulg'd by Purley's holy Seer, Pants not thy breast, with transport thrill'd, To see his prophecy fulfill'd; When Jacobin reform uncheck'd Shall take its radical effect! List! each Whig-commoner and peer! Whig-churchmen, Whig-dissenters, hear! Whig-bards your patriotic fiction Forego for Parson H??ne's prediction! Acknowledge, ye Whig-parsons all, Among the prophets Brentford's Saul! Hear him denounce extermination To each rank, party, and persuasion, Anticipate the doom funereal Of dignity and state imperial, When subjects shall not know subjection, Nor touch prelatic shed infection, When prebendary vicar, sexton, When all who gloss the sacred text on, All self-intitled Babes of Grace, Their spiritual descent who trace, And Apostolic pedigree, From fishermen of Galilee, And, to demonstrate the relation, Catch gudgeons by vociferation; 'Trap flat-fish with Sectarian tackle To store pond of the Tabernacle; And anathématize and ban Souls to the Devil's fryingpan.— When commissaries, clerks, inspectors, East India nabobs and directors, When all our noble Peers and Peers' kin, All barristers but Thomas Erskine; When Pittite, ay and Anti-pittite, Like Hivite, Girgashite, and Hittite Driv'n, without surplice, quoif, or bannian, From Revolutionary Canaan, Promiscuous ruin shall o'erthrow, The work of Horne Tooke, Stone, and Co. This you'll acknowledge, one and all, Is Reformation Radical. This Reformation in the gross is; Beards, eye-brows, whiskers, warts, and noses Its patent razor from your sconce—Sir, Sweeps, at one stroke, like slashing Tonsor, Beneath whose weapon hapless curate Bleeds (ah, what Rector could endure it!) And oft as Saturday recurs And sees subaltern rev'rend Sirs, Met by hebdomadary charter, Bristles retrench, and sermons barter, Read Anti-jacobin newspaper, Whiff mild tabacco's friendly vapour, And, hopeless of Vicarial port, To Cerevisian draught resort, To lubricate and wet their whistles For reading Gospels and Epistles.— Bid Semi-Reformationists Declare wherein Reform consists, And, laymen, cleric, whig, and tory, They tell us, each, a different story. Hear one to amputation spur us Of that state-gangrene, rotten Boroughs— List to another's dismal croak: The Constitution 's craz'd and broke, And there's no hope it will be mended While Habeas Corpus is suspended.— Dissenters cry: “We for the best Advise you Sirs:—Repeal the Test! Give Us preferment, wealth, and place, We'll gladly undertake your case: And, though we say't that should not say, The whole Materia Medica Has nothing in it, we'll assure you, That like our alt'rative can cure you.”— The recreant crew, Sedition's panders, With gross scurrilities and slanders, Who bait their country's friends, and worry her Through Morning Chronicle and Courier, Those muddy channels of detraction, Mishapen forgery, and faction, Cry: “Give us, in this Age of Reason, “Carte blanche to vend and publish treason; “Free scope afford our green-goose quills; “Rescind your d?d Sedition Bills; “Deliver us from mortal fear “Of Pitt, the nation's charioteer: “Precipitate him from his box, “And to our Coryphœus, Fox, “Entrust the reins—distinctions level— “And only let us to the Devil “Drive all your Ministerial train off, “We'll leave you nothing to complain of.”— In an old book, that's left i' the lurch, Save by queer folk who go to church, We read that safety's to be found Where learned counsellors abound; If then, in zeal for Britain's good, Of counsellors a multitude, Opinions give profound as these, And of their client ask no fees, (Unlike your trading King's-bench counsel Who admonition by the ounce sell), Our Constitution safe and sound 'Gainst all attacks must stand its ground.— Yet, 'though these reformadoes wiser Than Solomon in their own eyes are, They're but reforming geese and calves Who do their business by halves.— Patrons of Courier, Post, and Chronicle! Whig Sectaries, and Whigs canonical; Chairmen of Opposition revels, Whig Printers leagued with all your devils; Quid-nuncs, who climb debating rostrums, What are your alterative nostrums To Horne Tooke's Reformation Broom, That sweeps an empire to its doom!— Doctors of Med'cine grow renown'd By dint of making sick men sound; Fame-seeking Doctors politic With trite harangues make sound men sick, And 'though they oft get nothing by't, Prescribe and give advice for spite: Patent pretend from mob-authority To purge a plethoric majority, And cure the sturdy wights who thwart 'em Of loyalty,—secundum artem. Yet ev'ry doctor's but a dunce To him who kills and cures at once: The Constitution in a breath Recruits by bleeding it to death.— Resolve, Horne Tooke, this paradox! (For, proof against Old Bailey shocks, What nobler triumph couldst thou boast, Unless to fill th' important post Of meanest private in the bands Of maudlin cits whom Fox commands, A bankrupt cause and chest to aid;— Illustrious Chief of Whig-brigade!)— Thou who, by such a general led, Wouldst dye thy cast-off black coat red, Shoulder thy firelock, and take aim At monarchy, the noblest game; And neither conscience-struck nor sorry, Search through the ranks thy Royal quarry. Oh deign to state with just precision (Reveal'd to thy prophetic vision, And current in anticipation) The sum, exceeding calculation, Of public happiness accruing From indiscriminative Ruin! Shew how the wreck of ranks and orders Shall give us peace in all our borders— And blest Equality repay us If we convert the realm to chäos— Shew how, in cutting off a Crown'd Head, The Rights of Citizens are founded! Shew us how Freedom sanctions slaughter, And changes blood to holy water! As Spain's Jack Ketch of ancient date, When Carlos quarrell'd with his fate, Admonish'd him;—“Pray, Sir, be steady; “'Tis for your good that I behead ye!” Let none contemn as tainted trash This dainty Reformation-hash, Much less our Whig-Archimagirus To set us down to 't so desirous: But join to eulogize Horne Tooke, And freely own one Brentford Cook, Who welcomes us to such Good Things, Is worth a brace of Brentford Kings; And, 'though our beef he 's gallimaufryd, Swear 'tis the best we ever sáw fried! Yet since Fried Cabbage, or, what 's worse To some folks, Frícando of verse From brain of poet piping hot, is Likely to parch the epiglottis Of patient readers, who neglect Red Lane adusted to humect: Let me an antidote suggest Which all allow—“probatum est.”— Of old Oporto bumpers nine Quaff to the Muses' healths and mine! Thus prim'd I'll set before you soon A Second Course to th' self-same tune.— Cheaper you'll no where read or eat; Since Half-a-crown defrays your treat: Of which for Paper wove and press'd are Two Shillings paid, for Wit a Tester. And, as plump cits with brandy choose To qualify roast pig and goose, 'Tis my prescription; “Let a dram be “Taken cum Repetita Crambe!”— END OF THE FIRST PART. CRAMBE REPETITA: A SECOND COURSE OF BUBBLE AND SQUEAK, OR BRITISH BEEF GALLI-MAUFRY'D. ? Liberius si Dixero quid, si forte jocosius: hoc mihi juris Cum venia dabis. Hor. S. Lib. I. Sat. iv. “Oh that I was a red hot poker!” Thrice that Stentorophónic stoker Of coal-black conscience, R??l??d H?ll, Vociferates,—“that I, at will, “Might in your hearts, ye God-less race, “Stir up the smould'ring fire of Grace!”— Thus o'er their tankards and decanters Whigsters and Revolution ranters, Our H???rds, Wh??????ds, Gr??s, and more hacks Of Opposition, strain their thorax Eager to kindle through the nation A red-hot zeal for Reformation. Would you believe these prating drinkers,— The Constitution 's made for tinkers, Who fain would patch up her old house, and, While they mend one hole, make a thousand. Reform, or democratic botching, Is to New Whigs meat, drink, and lodging: And oft they cast a wistful glance, Where cherishes enlighten'd France The Tree by Faction's vot'ries priz'd, And hail the Blessing realiz'd. See from that soil all ills expell'd Which erst Pandora's casket held! There kindles Radical Reform The Revolutionary storm; Exterminates those unclean beasts, Denominated Kings and Priests, That, nurs'd in her Augëan stable, Impos'd for ages on the rabble Restrictions obsolete and odd, Allegiance and the fear of God; Taught duties barbarous and crude, Justice, good faith, and gratitude; Profanely cherish'd Revelation, That sanctified abomination; And bade men venerate the Bible, That Counter-revolution Libel, Of Gallic freedom, faith, and works, Intolerant as Edmund Burke's— Though Payne has prov'd the whole a fable Devis'd by rev'rend knaves in sable. There, though the Sabbath 's out of season, Décades they boast, and Feasts of Reason: Turn Crucifixes out of doors, And adoration pay to wh?s. For France is too refin'd a nation To worship, in the Pagan fashion, A cold, insensate Deity That cannot speak, nor hear, nor see; Whose countenance a nose may brag on, That never peep'd into a flagon; Nay to take snuff, or sneeze, or smell, A shoeing-horn might serve as well: Whose throat can chaunt no civic tunes, Nor medlars tell from macaroons: No.—French Philosophers take pride all In worshipping a Living Idol; And to a Goddess sacrifice Who, rosy lips, and wanton eyes, And breasts protuberant, and what else, Of meretricious goods and chattels, Kind Nature gave, black, brown, or fair. Devotes to public wear and tear. To this Divinity they burn Incense, who freely one good turn Wont with another to repay, Can flames enkindle and allay; Nay, to oblige her special friends Can light their candle at both ends, Repay their pious fumigation By suscitating conflagration, In pericrane of Philosopher 'Till his regen'rate brains boil over, And adoration he'll gainsay all, Save what is paid to Reason's Baal. Thus while above his fervours glow His Goddess fires her mines below, Fraught with electric sparks and shocks From Cytheréan tinder-box, 'Till he 's convinc'd that Cupid's torch is A brand that scarifies and scorches, And Reason's aid in this emergence Less efficacious than the surgeon's. Adepts in Alchemy renown'd, Boast they've the wondrous secret found Base coin of Birmingham to mould And metamorphose into gold; And royal Midas with a touch, Old Fablers say, could do as much. Play'd he at commerce or all-fours, His counters chang'd to luidores: He strokes his chin, and all admire His bristly beard become gold wire: And, fed with choice rappee, his nose A living mine of gold dust glows: He walk'd his field and saw the sod Teem with a crop of golden rod: He seiz'd his oaken staff; behold In 's hand the Sybil's branch of gold! Of hock and water on his table he Brew'd at each gulp aurum potabile: Converted codlins bought for farthings To apples of Hesperian gardens: Pilchards and herrings in his dish Transform'd themselves into gold fish: Sausage envelop'd in a thin gut He chang'd into a golden ingot: Of mustard pot he next laid hold, But grasp'd, in lieu, a pot of gold: Your Vauxhall slice of ham or beef He masticated to gold-leaf; And bade black-puddings transmigrate Into rouleaus upon his plate:— But in that Country where Confusion Usurps the name of Revolution, And petti-foggers and sow-gelders Senates and Councils form of Elders, Since Legislative confiscation Answers all ends of transmutation, Gold-making 's deem'd a sorrier trade Than 'tis to steal it ready made: And, since they're well convinc'd to boot, That wealth of evil is the root, They wisely wage inveterate quarrels With ore that would corrupt their morals; Which that they may preserve intact They Midas' talent counteract, And by their grand financial mystery, (Unparallell'd in modern history, In whose gazettes they bounce and vapour,) Reform their luidores to Paper; Make specie at their touch reducible To nought in Requisition-crucible; Ensepulchre men's gold and plate In grand Crusophagus of state, From whence regenerated cash is Hatch'd like a Phœnix from its ashes; And, freed in purgatory Gallic From its corporeal part metallic, Again to circulation springs On metaphysic paper wings; 'Till, by the plund'rers who devis'd Its fabrication exorciz'd, And of all tenure dispossess'd, Evaporates the Swindling Pest: While famish'd dupes behold dismay'd Credit's pale ghost for ever laid.— But though at length annihilation Hath rid of this fell scourge the nation, Yet rancour, strife, chicane, oppression, Craft, falsehood, treach'ry take possession In right of predecessor fiend, And where their wide-spread woes extend Ills more destructive than the first Engender these Sev'n Sprites accurst. 'Tis thus reforms enlighten'd France, Both her Religion and Finance, Whose reformation 's of a piece With her regen'rated Police, Which scorns to tread the beaten road Prescrib'd by law's impartial code, No more on evidence depends But bayonet to gain her ends: All pleas of justice interdicts, First dooms and afterwards convicts: Expatriates its own creators, Directors, ancients, legislators, Bids 'em, by scores in waggons cramm'd, With a “Sic Volo,” go be d?d! Proscrib'd unheard their native soil, In Afric's torrid regions broil; Or destins on Guiana's strand To pestilence the patriot band, Who, faithful to their public trust, Presum'd at Paris to be just. If such be Reformation's fruit Where first that goodly plant took root, If her rich bed of Gallic mould, With harvest of an hundred fold Prolific teem,—with plenty crown'd See France in charity abound: Roast meat, she cries, if well she fares, And with the world her blessings shares: “'Twere greedy to engross so much, “And give none to my friends the Dutch; “What, gorge alone!—while not a mess is “Dish'd up for their High Mightinesses! “Come, ope your mouths, Mynheers, we'll feed 'em “With forc'd meat of Reform and Freedom: “Start not 'though Frenchmen, sword in hand, do “Present You with this fine Fricando, “Here freely feed.—You run no risk in “Respect of weasand-pipe or griskin, “From your good friends who scorn to sabre “Or stab an inoffensive neighbour: “To answer might your wisdoms puzzle “Reports from Gallic cannon's muzzle; “But never let our charge affright “Folks who can pay a bill at sight, “Nor tremble in a vain belief “We scent your herrings and smok'd beef; “Each French Reformer with his own is “Contented—your sage Belgic cronies “Won't in this weighty point mislead ye, “Consult them and experto crede. “Then set your hearts at rest, and hear “Our conscientious Chieftains swear “By Him on high, whose kingdom stood “As long as France thought fit it should; “Or Him below, th' infernal blade, “Whom we've outdone at his own trade— “Or we the Veidam oaths a score on “Will take, or, if you please, the Koran, “That France of your high mighty persons “Shall be as tender as of hér sons— “Shall pledge herself in solemn pact “To keep your property intact— “That of Batavian Independence “We'll be th' assertors and defendants— “With kind embrace fraternal greet you, “And love you well enough—to eat you.” The Dutchmen answer'd in a fright: Since their French friends were too polite To stand on formal invitation, They felt a load of obligation, Whose weight they could not well express, And therefore left their Guests to guess, Who, over rivers, dams, and ditches, As if they'd been convoy'd by witches, On broomstick-geldings, whip and spur, Brought 'em good news and gunpowder: For both which blessings to requite 'em, They would do any thing but fight 'em. The points on which they had descanted They took most thankfully for granted; And—since they could not send them packing— Drank their good healths, gin-grog and 'rack in. “Save you, Mynheers”—cried these new-comers, And merrily toss'd off their rummers— “As you ne'er strove to keep us out, “We'll grant you are wise men and stout; “And for your victuals, drink, and lodgings, “Expect, in lieu, from us true Trojans, “Such feats, that ev'ry mother's son “Shall own performance has outrun “Our promises.—Our word we gave t' ye, “To guarantee your persons' safety— “And, lo, our thrice-redoubted soldiers “Have left your heads upon your shoulders! “This, from our Reformado-race, “Account no common mark of grace.— “We swore we would forbear to seize “Your Property.—Then keep your fleas: “And from your marshes, fens, and bogs, “'Though French-men, we'll not filch your frogs, “But gratis be content to cut on “Sirloins of beef, prime veal and mutton. “And deem not we infringe our oath in “Engrossing all your carnal clothing, “Shirts, waistcoats, pantaloons and brogues, “To furbish up our tatter'd rogues: “Nor growl, tho' stripp'd from snout to great-toe, “As naked as a par'd potatoe: “What if your dinners, shirts, and shoes—Sirs, “We borrow,—You can be no losers, “Since we Fraternity commute “For meat and drink and clothes to boot, “And, generating Reformation “By fundamental denudation, “Make Dutchmen, on whose spoils we've fatten'd, “What this end loses gain at that end; “And, from incumbrance freed below decks, “Sansculottize both Soul and Podex, “Like those of Clootz, a precious pair, “Stripp'd sympathetically bare; “'Till ev'ry Frenchified-Mynheer “Shall emulate that British Peer, “And most profound Gymnosophist “Of all the Anglo-gallic list; “Who, 'midst th' Aristocratic corps, “Abjured the breeches that he wore: “Dismantling his lean Lodge of Honour “To class with Citizen O'Connor. “You 've a rare bargain, Sirs! In th' end on 't, “We vow'd to make you Independent— “Videlicet—of your best friends! “Which—if not yours—will serve our ends; “And that is, you may well discern all, “The self-same thing 'twixt blades fraternal. “Then swear, as we do, on this jorum, “In sæcula, boys, sæculorum, “'Gainst Britain's insolent dominion, “(As swore the one-eyed Carthaginian “Against Rome's peace;—nor deem, applied “This simile, to your blind side)— “Inveterate enmity to nourish, “And shew, like Us, in actions currish, “Who'd fire the globe, set hell in motion, “To crush those tyrants of the ocean. “'Tis well!—Our Mandate You've obey'd.— “Now, of Dependence, who 's afraid?— “De Winter, see, the rogues have beat: “You're independent of—your Fleet.— “Lo, to the South, their course they shape! “You're independent of—the Cape, “Amboyna, Banda's isles, Ceylon.— “(Who nutmegs wants, or cinnamon?) “For Zealand and your Netherlands “Care not.—We'll take them off your hands; “And garrison your frontier towns. “Thus France your independence crowns!— “Yet, one thing please to note beside, “That France must be indemnified “For these kind services she 's done ye: “Stand and deliver, Sirs, your Money! “Grudge it not Us who came so far “To sell you assignats at par. “And, 'till sly Ramel knock' o' the head it, “Enrich'd you with our paper-credit! “We ask but—all that's in your chest; “Pay that:—We'll trust you for the rest. “Though you dared keep, ('till the Great Nation “Effected your regeneration,) “To fight pro aris and pro focis, “A Stadtholder, beneath our noses. “Down with your cash!—Well; since you've done 't, “We'll pocket it besides th' affront; “And beg you'll live content and easy “'Till, as our sponge, again we squeeze ye.” The Horseleech and her daughters twain, Saith Solomon, the life-blood drain Unsated, and athirst for more They cry, “Give, give, da, da,” encore. Here doubtless, in prophetic trance, Of that fell Horseleech, Modern France, The sapient writer had a glimpse, And saw her two accursed imps, Rapacity, and t'other daughter, Still more unconscionable, Slaughter: For 'though her reformation zeal Made of Sev'n Provinces a meal, Still rages, ne'er to be controll'd, Her appetite for blood and gold.— Cold, temperate, and torrid clime Sees her infuriate lust of crime Burst ev'ry social bond, confound Order, spread insurrection round; Rob, outrage, massacre, and spoil Mankind from Holstein to the Nile. Yet Opposition France acquit, “The common enemy is Pitt,” Justly abhorr'd by each New Whig Because he never cared a fig How much his martial provocation Incens'd their friends of the Great Nation.— Yet Erskine will our ears be dinning With “France more sinn'd against than sinning,”— And vent in egotistic prose his Profound concern lest Whiggish noses Should smell—if not a rat—a stink, Since George extinguish'd Fox's link; Yet Charles—despairing of resistance— Still from St. Stephen's keeps his distance: Resistance—You'll perhaps suppose The patriot means—to Britain's foes. Mistake him not! Fox recommends Resistance to Britannia's friends, Kings, Lords, and Commons: these, he fears, Are but so many Robespierres; Whom, since they've cured us of sedition, He fain would cure, as Whig-physician, Of playing such another trick On England's body-politic. “Can Freemen sleep secure o' nights “While wrongs repeal the Bill of Rights; “To curb, forsooth, Sedition's crew, “All honourable men and true “As he for whom, at Maidstone tried, “I swore so lustily and l?d?— “Back'd by right noble Blue and Buff-folk, “Earl Thanet, Oxford, Norfolk, Suffolk, “(Who told the Court, and told my Lady, “Of morals, locks, post-chaise, and Paddy), “In whose behalf too lied and swore “Whig-commoners as many more: “Hal Grattan, Whitbread, Taylor Mic—, “Who, for an opposition Chick, “Can swear a tolerable stick: “Though nothing like us old game-cocks, “Brindsley, the Barrister, and Fox.”— But if the friends of Britain feel The rancour of our patriot's zeal, His generous plaudit he bestows As freely on his country's foes. When the fell snake Regenerate France Cast her old slough, Allegiance; When, teeming with a nation's woes, Her baleful womb's convulsive throes, Gave to the world its ravening brood Of anarchists baptiz'd in blood, Who, fraternizing with the rabble, Those brick-makers of modern Babel, Uprear'd her dread volcanic frame Surcharg'd with Insurrection's flame, That, towering in gigantic pride, All powers of heav'n and earth defied: Fox, with congratulating smile, Enraptur'd view'd “the noblest pile “That mortal wisdom e'er devis'd, “And hail'd Eutopia realiz'd.” But when Aboukir's rescued strand, Brave Nelson! thy resistless band Beheld, of seamen bold and staunch, The thunder of destruction launch On faithless Gallia's naval host; Round Egypt's gratulating coast, While Britain's Cross triumphant wav'd, Blest ensign of an empire sav'd!— Proud of the palms his valour won, While Albion glories in her Son; And strains of gen'ral joy proclaim The vast accession to her fame.— See Faction, sickening at the deed, From scenes of honest joy seceed, Enshroud in tavern-haunts aloof Her clouded brow and cloven hoof, And prompt her chosen Advocate Ills to enlarge on and create; And mingle with adult'rate wine His stream of eloquence malign: “Friends, whose subscriptions line my fob, “True subjects of my Liege, the Mob; “Long since, you know, in sullen spite, “I bade the Commons' House good night, “And march'd off, confidently judging “They'd my secession take in dudgeon; “And, for the safety of the nation, “Intreat me to resume my station.— “For, as old Cato at Rome's shows “Thought fit to introduce his nose, “Merely to take it out again, “And stalk away in high disdain: “So I, on my secession-hack “Mounted, in hopes to gallop back, “Hail'd by the rabble's plausive shout, “Just as the Roman Churl went out. “Though such has been my drift, 'tis fit “That you should know your Chairman's bit. “Sirs, at my stratagem they laugh, “(Old birds are n't to be caught with chaff,) “And jog on merrier than before, “Since Opposition 's now no more. “Now this is horribly provoking “To one who loves to clap a spoke in “Each wheel of government's machine; “I thought I should have burst with spleen: “When opportunely You commanded, “And straight from apex of St. Anne, did “Come down your sullen Cincinnatus “Relinquishing his roast-potatoes, “Swing-tail and cacklers, syllabub, “And blooming Bet, to serve the Club. “So, without invitation given, “Twice I've revisited St. Stephen: “First, to devote to execration, “That most unprincipled invasion “Of Sovereign People's goods and chattels, “To fight their Subject-Monarch's battles; “Which, though some choose to call ‘assessment,’ “Depend upon 't there's nothing less meant “Than from your pockets to purloin, “And to their own translate your coin: “When, so complete was my success, “You'll never pay one doit the less. “Proud of encouragement like this, “I thought it would not be amiss “To bore the House another day, “And with desponding phiz pourtray “The storm that o'er the heads was gathering “Of our United Irish Brethren, “Harass'd by Pitt in their vocation “Of treason and assassination: “Such tyranny 'twas deem'd you'd kick at; “So here the Commons clos'd their wicket. “On mischief they were bent, no doubt, “When they presum'd to shut You out, “And keep,—indignant I remark— “Their own Constituents in the dark. “Alas! this dark, exclusive dealing, “Affects me with a fellow-feeling; “Who, for these fifteen years and more, “Have been o' the wrong side of the door: “Shut out o' the Cabinet in spite, “With partner N???? at twelve at night: “Scath'd with the blast, abrupt and rude, “Of th' ill state wind that blows none good: “Which broke the firm of Coalition; “Thenceforth the topic of derision: “Compell'd me poverty to plead, “A Yellow Patriot run to seed; “A patriot, useless ev'ry where, “Save in Conservatorial Chair, “Where I great Freedom's rites prolong, “With Howard's toast and Dignum's song; “Fost'ring, with vinous irrigation, “The baby-cause of Reformation, “While all our democratic prigs “Hail me Wet-Nurse of Sucking-Whigs. “Last year's events I've scann'd—they shew me “Some prosp'rous scenes, and others gloomy; “Together ta'en—they on my mind “No good impression leave behind. “Now, you must know, my friends, I like “That same Philosopher antique, “(Though be assured, not half so well, “As those in France that bear the bell) “Who, with his royal master chattering, “Requested to dispense with flattering “His Majesty, would condescend, “Because he meant to be his friend.— “And thus, for ev'ry Royal Sir, “(Elector, viz. of Westminster; “For other Royalty, you know, “I've turn'd my back on long ago,) “Trust me, the high consideration “I feel precludes all consolation: “I, your true friend, see nought but evils, “Enough to give you the Blue Devils. “You've toasted Nelson in a brimmer:— “Yet fortune, to my ken, looks grimmer “By half, Sirs, than she did before he “Enhanc'd Great Britain's naval glory. “'Twas, I'll admit, a feat to crack on— “Yet this White Day 's to me a Black One; “And since some weep for joy, I'll borrow “Of Joy a tear or two for Sorrow. “Te Deum sing who will to cheer ye; “I choose to chaunt my Miserere; “And, for the Souls, lament and groan, “Of those who told us they had none!

“This domineering Treasury Lad “Will drive me melancholy mad; “And yet, Sirs, I'm no pining fellow “Whose melancholy 's green and yellow, “Mine 's made of Opposition stuff, “Right melancholy Blue and Buff. “Upon a monumental pile “Patience at Grief may sit and smile, “But I'm content with seat more humble, “Upon this chair I'll sit and grumble: “Nor shall concealment wear my soul, “Nor feed on my brown-damask jowl: “Nor me shall scare restrictive laws “From toasting Freedom's desp'rate cause, “Exil'd France, Switzerland, and Poland, “Asylum she can find in no land! “Here, should the Red Cap grace her crown, “Pitt o'er her visage pulls it down, “And ties her up in her own garters, “As he has down her Irish Martyrs. “Sure, to make traitors bite the dust is “The very climax of injustice! “Our honest Whigs, he'll ne'er enlist 'em “To militate for such a system, “To white-wash—who so roundly swore— “Erin's Apostate Blackamoor. “Your true-bred Whig, by right of nature “Is guardian, trustee, legislator “T' himself; nor law, nor reason's voice “Direct him, but his own Free Choice. “All Sov'reigns made to be cashier'd “He thinks, except the Sov'reign Herd: “On principle he 's still at variance “With all but Multitudinarians, “Who deem the Hydra-crested Brute “Infallible and absolute, “O'er all authorities supreme, “Whig-eulogy's exhaustless theme. “And 'tis, no doubt, his wisest course “Thus to extol his Stalking Horse: “On whose broad flanks he's wont to vault, “When he directs his mask'd assault “'Gainst our State Fortress; for Whig Nob “Is Primum Mob-ile of Mob; “Which, as Scotch Bagpiper his drone, “Whig first inflates, then plays upon: “First claps o' the back Seditious Cur, “Then of his growl 's Interpreter: “Christ'ning Swill'd Insolence and Noise, “‘The Sov'reign People's sacred voice.’ “They who to Cæsar render Cæsar's “Dues have no thanks from you and me, Sirs. “We adulation's tribute-penny “Pay only to Our Liege—The Many, “Who reigns by voluntary suffrage “Of all who feel the Blue and Buff rage. “'Twas Britons' voluntary spunk “That gave Dutch Will, with nose adunque, “Three Crowns—but old Whigs, I suppose, “Could not see far beyond their nose, “Or they had ne'er impos'd the weight “Of Three Crowns on One single Pate; “But laid Mynheer upon the shelf, “And ev'ry Whig enthron'd himself. “This sounds to loyal ears uncouth, “Yet 'tis an everlasting truth: “And these opinions, as I state 'em, “Form, of Whig Club, the grand Substratum. “But Tories, Whig-antipodes, “Broach dogmas, the reverse of these: “And Tories we denominate “All those who steer the helm of State; “A set of arbitrary fellows, “Who have the confidence to tell us “That Whigs, to law's imperious yoke, “Must bend as well as other folk. “Rebellious Irishmen they hold, “By martial force should be controll'd: “And, though Free Will in ev'ry case is, “Of Government the solid basis, “They grudge Hibernian Whigs Free Will, “To outrage, plunder, burn, and kill,— “Tyrannically stretch their necks “To cure 'em of such harmless freaks; “Nay, 'though they should but exercise “Their most undoubted Right to rise, “An hempen bandage to the weason “Apply, as remedy for treason; “And, by despotic windpipe-crushing, “Annihilate all free discussion. “Here was this Principle applied, “Who knows what fate might Whigs betide; “Ah, were we not of hemp afraid, “'Twere fit exertions should be made! “For I do feel our state disastrous “While these confounded Tories master us.— “Though Michael struts, though N??f??k's drinking, “I feel the Constitution sinking: “Nor, without Radical Reform, “Can Opposition brave the storm. “Sore has her Squadron felt the shocks “Of Westminster and Maidstone Rocks, “Th???t 's in Banco Regis moor'd, “And S??????'s sense gone over-board; “B?rd??t's brave Crew in Cold Bath bound, “C???tn?y's flat-bottom'd wit aground; “J??yl, on grave consideration, “Hangs out his flag of recantation; “And Wh??????? 'neath the table roll'd, “Pumps up the Porter from his hold.— “Freely my sentiments I've utter'd; “For on which side my bread is butter'd, “And who they are will serve my turn, “Thank God, I am not now to learn. “The sapient and enlighten'd Few “Give me their cash, I them their cue, “Who, while in common cause we join, “Pay sterling Worth with current Coin: “An honour 'tis to be connected “With patriots all as well affected “To Liberty's Whig honour'd Saplin “As I am, or their Brentford Chaplain; “And there's no need for me to say “He's a great Patriot in his way. “And, for myself, in ninety-seven, “Erskine, first Counsel under Heaven, “Told you that, for my good behaviour, “I, as my Shipwreck'd Country's Saviour, “Was mark'd, by Providence divine: “(I never heard a speech so fine! “Nor do I think such beauties lurk “In his inestimable Work.) “Nay, what is more, Charles Grey, esquire, “Whose splendid talents Whigs admire, “For fear it should escape unheard, “Retail'd his flummery word for word. “Your eleemosynary pence “Have giv'n me ease and affluence, “And, fatt'ning on your kind subscription, “Though Government in base Egyptian “Bondage should make you all bow down, “Against the grain, to George's Crown; “Tho' Pitt your purses squeeze and shrink 'em “With this confounded Tax on Income, “Account me still your doughty knight, “Ready, whether you're wrong or right, “(With Wine and Rhetoric charg'd like Falstaff,) “To rant, and brandish at your call staff, “And fight your battles o'er again “'Gainst Ministerial Buckram Men. “Mob-majesty, still at his levee, “Shall see me and my hopeful Nephew. “I'll in his Sov'reign cause enlist all “My knaves: Nym-F??st, and E??k??e-Pistol, “Poins-R????l too, and Sh???y-Bardolph: “We'll from your sides State-cudgel ward off. “Dauntless myself shall trace before ye “The road of Democratic glory; “Ne'er shall you be by me forsook, “Or dropp'd at Hounslow as by Tooke, “Who, 'though my friend, 's a scurvy shepherd, “That led his lambkins to be pepper'd; “Just staid his dang'rous theme to broach, “Then stepp'd out of Sedition's Coach: “Still, staunch and loyal to the gang, “With you I'll drink, for you harangue, “'Till safe I land you, from the Alehouse, “At Insurrection's Goal—The Gallows.
