      <field name="fulltext">MINOR POEMS, INCLUDING NAPOLEON. TO THE KING; THIS SMALL VOLUME OF POEMS, BY HIS KIND PERMISSION, Is Inscribed, WITH GRATITUDE AND RESPECT, BY THE AUTHOR. SONNET. “Blessings be with them, and eternal praise, Who gave us nobler loves, and nobler cares, The poets, who on earth have made us heirs Of truth and pure delight by heavenly lays! Oh! might my name be number'd among theirs, Then gladly would I end my mortal days.” Wordsworth. Not in the shade of academic bowers, Nor yet in classic haunts, where every breeze Wakes, with its whispers, music among trees, Which shelter by their shadow fragrant flowers; Has it been mine to nurse my minstrel powers. Nor have I, lull'd in literary ease, Dreamt of ascending, even by degrees, The glittering steep where “Fame's proud temple” towers. Yet have I been at times a listener To them, whose hallow'd harps are now suspended In silence!—and have ventur'd to prefer A prayer, in which both hope and fear were blended, That I might rank, their fellow-worshipper, In the esteem of some, when life be ended. NAPOLEON. NAPOLEON. I It was a lovely morning; — all was calm, As if creation, thankful for repose, In renovated beauty, breathing balm And blessedness around, from slumber rose; Joyful once more to see the East unclose Its gates of glory:—yet subdued and mild, Like the soft smile of Patience, amid woes, By hope and resignation reconciled, That morning's beauty shone, that landscape's charm beguiled. II The heavens were mark'd by many a filmy streak, Even in the orient; and the sun shone through Those lines, as Hope upon a mourner's cheek Sheds, meekly chasten'd, her delightful hue. From groves and meadows, all impearl'd with dew, Rose silv'ry mists,—no eddying wind swept by,— The cottage chimneys, half conceal'd from view By their embow'ring foliage, sent on high Their pallid wreaths of smoke unruffled to the sky. III And every gentle sound which broke the hush Of morning's still serenity, was sweet; The sky-lark over head; the speckled thrush, Who now had taken with delight his seat Upon the slender larch, the day to greet; The starling, chattering to her callow young; And that monot'nous lay, which seems to fleet Like echo through the air, the cuckoo's song, Was heard at times, far off, the leafy woods among. IV Surrounded by such sights and sounds, I stood, Delighted auditor, spectator there; And gave full scope, in meditative mood, To thoughts excited by a scene so fair: Feeling renewedly how matchless are The power and goodness of that great Supreme, Who form'd and fashion'd all things to declare, Even to those who lightly of Him deem, The beauty and the love of His creative scheme. V “And God beheld, and saw that all was good!” Thus was it at the first; thus would it be, If man would ponder rightly, as he should, His duty, and deputed sov'reignty. Nature pursues aright the course which He Prescribed, nor violates her Maker's will: The mighty earth and the magnificent sea, The bright stars in their courses, serve him still; Beast, bird, fish, insect, all alike his laws fulfil. VI Nor can rebellious man, however great His aberrations from the simple line Of manifested duty, violate The purpose of Omnipotence divine; Nor mar his blest and ultimate design, With whom e'en angels fruitlessly have striven; Whose word enjoins us, when we seek the shrine Of prayer, to supplicate to be forgiven, And that His will be done on earth as 'tis in heaven. VII But though man's disobedience, by the skill Of Him who rules alike effect and cause, Bringing forth real good from seeming ill, Unconsciously co-operate with those laws That govern all; yet he who so withdraws From duty's path, which leads to happiness, Whether seduced from thence by Fame's applause, Or by less noble motives, brings distress Most surely on himself— Who must not this confess? VIII And oh, how often that distress extends To innocent suff'rers, whose delight, or woe, By Heaven's appointment, with our being blends, Happy, or wretched, as ourselves are so! Even in private life, full well we know That no man lives unto himself, nor dies; But that around the humblest beings grow Those flowers, or weeds, which every hour that flies, Flings shade or sunshine on, and more augments the ties IX By which the joy or sorrow of one heart Is link'd unto another's—and if this Hold true of those who act a private part Upon the world's wide stage, whose bale or bliss But unto two, or three, of moment is, By all beside unheeded, or unknown; How is it proved when they decide amiss, Tempted by lust of power, or pride alone, Who wear the jewell'd crown, and fill the splendid throne! X Such thoughts as these, on that delightful morn, Pass'd through my mind; partly deriving birth From the unruffled aspect, sweetly worn By Nature's features, in her chasten'd mirth; Partly from tidings which had just gone forth, That He, the marvel of our latter age, Napoleon! who had seem'd to look on earth, As does the actor on his scenic stage, Had now fulfill'd his part, and closed his pilgrimage. XI Nor did that hour and scene, so sweetly mild, To me unfitted for such thoughts appear; In the world's turmoil man may be beguiled, Approving what might rather wake a tear: The heart's best feelings, the soul's eye and ear, Are deaden'd, blinded, deafen'd! party's spell O'erclouds what else were questionless and clear; Nor can we judge aright, or reason well, Of earth, or earth's affairs, while in its toils we dwell. XII Would we appreciate truly even things Of the world's converse daily, hourly theme, And put them to the test time only brings, By which posterity their worth will deem, We must not judge of them by what they seem, But what they are must for ourselves inquire; See with what latent good or ill they teem, Mark well what thoughts, what feelings they inspire; And to do this we must into ourselves retire. XIII For 'tis not in the conflict, fierce and loud, Of disputants, that truth is easiest gain'd; Nor from the vague opinions of the crowd, That accurate judgment soonest is attain'd. These must be won by charity unfeign'd, Discriminating thought, deep self-distrust; By weighing well what time hath not explain'd, And making that allowance truly just, Which we ourselves should claim, were ours the case discuss'd. XIV Does the world do this? are its judgments form'd, Its verdicts given, upon this sober scale? Alas! too oft the judgment seat is storm'd By passions, which make coward conscience quail; Or sophistry, by her delusive tale, Or zeal to prop some fair hypothesis, O'er candour, truth, and justice will prevail, Until “the worse, the better reason” is, Or seem so unto us, through our own prejudice. XV And thus, perchance, the conflict of opinion Has ris'n respecting Him, whose ensign bird, Before adversity had quail'd its pinion, Nor sun relax'd, nor winter's snows deterr'd. Where'er the rustling of its wing was heard The nations sprang to arms, their senates met, Debates ran high; for treaty some demurr'd, While others on one throw the stake would set, Cried, “Onward! to the field! Our arms shall triumph yet!” XVI Can it be strange, then, when brief breathing space From fiercest struggle only has been known, That widely diff'ring judgments should have place In minds which unambiguously have shown Or blame, or praise, from int'rest's source alone? Let us awhile but soberly reflect On rules that guide opinions of our own, When we or hope for good, or ill expect, And in another's fault, our folly we detect. XVII That they who in War's stormy element, And in its fiercer energies, can find That excitation, rude and violent, Which satisfies the unreflecting mind,— That these should be to war alone inclined, Is natural; and still more, if such a state Of warfare with self-int'rest be combined; 'Twere strange, indeed, if these could hesitate, Nor eagerly admire the mischievously great. XVIII Nor is this all; for there exists in man, In spite of better feelings, given to bless, And truer wisdom, what is good to scan, An appetite, a craving restlessness, And vulgar sympathy, (nor more nor less Can truth regard it,) that extracts its food From poison; and is touch'd by no distress, Unless the sufferer in its presence stood,— By which the warrior's tale is as a pastime woo'd. XIX Such must have moving accidents to stir The current of their feelings; thought, with them, Calm thought, is not the wise interpreter Of noiseless deeds; the conqueror's diadem Is sullied not, although its brightest gem With innocent blood be stain'd: these ask not how Was planted, water'd, rear'd, the laurel's stem Which gave the wreath that decks their idol's brow; They see it glitters there, and unto it they bow. XX Again; Napoleon was not famed alone For feats of arms, or for that magic skill, By which he made his hardy followers prone T' obey his edicts, and effect his will. In science, as in war, his name may fill No common niche; though in the first he might Be no profound adept, he wielded still What he had won with that consummate sleight, Which best might lure their praise who in her power delight. XXI Can we then marvel that a man like this Should win the idle plaudits of the crowd, Who reason little, and oft judge amiss, In praise now lavish, now in censure loud? Nor wondrous is it that some minds endow'd With powers that should not have been so misled, Forgot themselves; and to a splendour bow'd Which was not truly glorious, though it shed A brilliant lustre round the conqueror's crowned head. XXII Reverse we now the picture; we shall find, Or I mistake much, no less ample cause, At the abuse and obloquy assign'd Unto his name, at least awhile to pause, And doubt the portraiture which passion draws: The opposite of wrong, at times, may be Not wholly right; and truth, and candour's laws, Alike demand our judgment should be free From bigoted applause, or baser calumny. XXIII He who has rear'd his throne “upon the neck Of Fortune proud,” and who, in doing so, Has made of human welfare wanton wreck; Proving himself unmindful of the woe Of countless millions; must not hope to go Unscarr'd, and scatheless from the field of strife: Power and injustice, by example, show To basest natures, with resentment rife, Some way to be revenged; and this, to such, is life! XXIV The conqueror, therefore, must expect the meed Of his own lawlessness: that is, he must Not only bear the righteous doom decreed, The condemnation of the good and just; But even the renown he made his trust, For which he barter'd honourable fame, Will be denied him. Round the marble bust, The graven tablet, or the portrait's frame, A legend will be traced that charity must blame. XXV Not only will his real actions be Grossly misconstrued, foully vilified; But even darker deeds, perhaps, than He, In his most wanton lust of power, or pride, Ever contemplated, will be supplied By fraud, or falsehood; till the portraiture Be one from which his shade would turn aside, Humbled to think how little to allure Posterity is left; how much for pride to endure. XXVI He has no right to murmur; for he set Himself the example others have pursued; By violating rights, without regret, Which should with strictest reverence have been view'd: But not less watchfully to be eschew'd, By genuine charity, this foul disgrace, Than usurpation's wrongs: a mind endued With generous feelings rather would efface A blot unjustly thrown, than such with pleasure trace. XXVII These will not echo each opprobrious name Which party spirit chooses to apply; Nor give prompt credence to each tale that fame May trumpet forth, unasking “how,” or “why:” Knowing how readily a specious lie May even genuine worth calumniate; And that the man, on whom the public eye Is ever fix'd, in honour or in hate, Must pay the forfeit due unto such high estate. XXVIII But is there then no medium? or, because Napoleon's name alternately has been A theme for indiscriminate applause And fiercest censure, must we blindly lean To either? Truth is, surely, found between. And he who has not mingled in debate With those who loudest talk when least they mean, May, without erring widely, estimate Napoleon's lasting claim to be consider'd great. XXIX True greatness is not won by power alone, Even if that power be nobly, fairly gain'd; But as its influence unto good is prone, The plaudits of the virtuous are obtain'd. By this sure test alone may be explain'd All genuine greatness;—it has made mankind Wiser, and happier; it has never stain'd Its fame by selfishness, but borne in mind, That glory, to be true, must be with good combin'd. XXX God is not great because omnipotent! But because power, in Him, is understood, And felt, and prov'd, to be benevolent, And wise, and holy;—thus it ever should! For what He wills, we know, is pure and good, And has in view the happiness of all: Hence love and adoration;—never could The contrite spirit at his footstool fall, If Power, and Power alone, its feelings did appal! XXXI If then divinest power be truly so, Because its end and object is to bless; It follows, that all power which man can know, The highest even monarchs can possess, Displays alone their “less than littleness,” Unless it seek the happiness of man, And glory of the Highest;—nothing less Than such a use of power one moment can Make its possessor great, on Wisdom's godlike plan. XXXII Thus judg'd, Napoleon was not truly great; Because his actions to the world have shown, In language which admits of no debate, Self-aggrandizement was his end alone. He us'd his power, as conquerors are prone, And ever were, for selfish ends; and sought To extend his sway, and fortify his throne; Not by those gentler arts, with blessings fraught, But by War's ruthless spoil, with blood and rapine bought. XXXIII I will not say that he had no excuse, With those who judge by worldly policy; But this can never justify the abuse Of power, to Truth's discriminating eye: All the apology it can supply Amounts to this, alas! and little more; “He did but do, as some, in days gone by, Have done before him: it was thus of yore, And will be so, howe'er the fact we may deplore.” XXXIV This brings me, then, unto the main intent, Which first inspir'd this unelaborate strain; And, O! could I, by force of argument, Or by appeal to sympathy, obtain Even brief audience, surely not in vain Precepts, to which all Christians ought to bow, Might be again declar'd: Messiah's reign Of peace once more announc'd! “Assist me, Thou Who worest, for our sakes, around thy patient brow, XXXV “The thorny diadem! may thy meek Spirit, Which all who bear thy name should, in degree, By word and action, prove that they inherit, May this alone my inspiration be! The glorious cause is Thine! for unto thee Was given, before thy sway on earth began, A holy kingdom from contention free; And angels thus announc'd its scope and plan, Glory to God on high! peace and good will to man! XXXVI “Since Thou art fitly styl'd the Prince of Peace! And unto thee all power by love is given, So shed abroad thy Spirit, so increase Its influence upon earth; that hearts, now riven With angry feelings, which too long have striven To injure, may each harsher thought disown; And thy pure law of love, revered in heaven, May be on earth in human actions shown, Proving thy kingdom come, the heart of man thy throne. XXXVII “And unto them whose hearts anticipate, With earnest prayers, thy pure and peaceful reign, Give wisdom, meekness, zeal—to advocate The good they hope for; patience to sustain Its slow fulfilment; power to ‘turn again The battle to the gate;’ that these, made strong By Thee alone, may steadfastly remain Oppos'd to every violence and wrong; Seeking, by holy love, what Seers have promis'd long. XXXVIII “And, on this feeble effort to extend Thy gentle government and quiet creed, May that pure blessing through thy power descend, Which giveth good, and maketh wise indeed. Suffer thy Spirit for itself to plead, With its own energetic eloquence, That some who these unstudied lines shall read, May find them answer'd by that inward sense, Which gives awaken'd thought sublime intelligence.” XXXIX His blessing crav'd, revert we to our theme, And let us humbly ask ourselves, what right The Christian has, upon the Gospel scheme, To employ of force the all-unhallow'd might And wrong unmerited, by wrong requite? My kingdom is not of this world, if 'twere, The Saviour said, then would my followers fight: And can we, who profess his name to bear, In spite of his commands, for murderous strife prepare? XL Put up thy sword! the cup my Father gives Shall I not drink? 'Twas thus our Master spake, And he who in his Spirit breathes and lives, Like him will patiently injustice take, And bear it meekly, for his Pattern's sake: Knowing who hath immutably decreed — “Vengeance is mine alone!” he dares not wake For apprehended wrongs, in word or deed, Wrath's devastating woes, or to redress proceed. XLI But not by insulated precepts, strown Throughout the Gospel, war is prov'd to be Unlawful: that unlawfulness is shown By Christianity's whole tendency: This should be happiness and harmony; For all its doctrines uniformly prove How genuine is its holy sympathy, With peace, and gentleness, and joy, and love To all on earth below, and all in heaven above. XLII The wrath of man works not, nor can it work, The righteousness of God; because in it That latent evil cannot fail to lurk, Which proves it for such glorious task unfit: In characters of blood its deeds are writ; Nor has it learnt that lesson, first and best, Religion teaches, calmly to submit, And all its wishes, cares, and griefs to rest On His disposing power, and bow to its behest. XLIII These are hard sayings; who can such receive? Not they who, easily provok'd by ill, Resent it promptly, and themselves believe Fit arbiters of retribution still; Although their purpose is but to fulfil The puny wrath of disappointed pride; Whose judgment is the dictate of the will, Uncurbed by reason, and unsanctified By meek Religion's laws, which fitlier would decide. XLIV Now, he who has been tutor'd in the school Of Christ, and by its precepts has been taught To judge of all things by that nobler rule, Which revelation, by its light, has brought To bear upon those secret springs of thought Whence actions flow — sees how unfit is man, Viewing himself as truth proclaims he ought, His own imagin'd injuries to scan, And chastisement inflict, ev'n where he safely can. XLV They know but little of the human heart, Nor have they ever studied well their own, Who have not learnt with what insidious art To what we will our sophistry is prone. Our better reason will not speak alone: Passion will plead, and selfishness be heard: And these, combin'd, will overpower the tone Of conscience, whose inspeaking heavenly word Should be unquestion'd there, and unto all preferr'd. XLVI But is there not a reason yet unnam'd, That home to every human heart should come; Which, if it were on glory's field proclaim'd, Ay! on the verge of conflict! when the drum, The echoing trumpet, and the mingled hum Of hosts were heard—at once should break the spell? Appal each Christian's heart, and render dumb The boldest voice?—oh! let us ponder well, How different are the hopes on which in prayer we dwell! XLVII “Father! forgive our trespasses, as we Others forgive, who trespass against us!!” If, when we supplicate Heaven's majesty, Our words have any meaning, is it thus We show forgiveness? praying now with Huss, And then with Ztsca fighting! Oh! in vain May sciolists minuter points discuss; This outward rite reject, and that retain; We cannot, must not hide so palpable a stain. XLVIII Is there a man,—I ask not of his creed On minor points of faith,—whose lips have been Accustom'd thus to pray, that does not need Forgiveness from his God? with unblench'd mien Is he prepar'd to dye the verdant green He stands on with a brother's blood? and then Present himself with countenance serene, Before his Maker with his fellow men, And thus for mercy plead, by mercy shown again? XLIX I write in charity, and freely make Ample allowance for unconscious crime; I grant all any disputant could take For views and habits, which the poet's rhyme Has cherish'd long, from bards of olden time To those of latter days: my heart can thrill, I trust it can, with patriot hopes sublime: Yet, feeling thus, to me all war is still Forbidden by the law which says, Thou shall not kill. L Tradition, custom, habit, cannot plead Excuse for what is evil: well I know That many who have own'd the Christian creed, And have in part adorn'd it, o'er a foe Have fought, and conquer'd; and, in doing so, Have render'd, as they thought, a patriot's due; But, owning this, I cannot so forego My views of right and wrong, of false and true, As think them right in this, and own the Gospel too. LI Nay more, I have delightful converse held On themes of lofty thought, with some who wear The livery of war; and uncompell'd, Most grateful testimony I could bear, Not to their moral worth alone and care To walk uprightly in the sight of men, But more than this; nor would my spirit dare To doubt for such divine acceptance, when The final trump shall sound, the dead shall rise again. LII But can e'en such examples, while I feel Renewedly their force still unforgot, Th' express command of God himself repeal, Or from his book its brightest precept blot? Christians may err, but surely Christ could not; And he declar'd the simple, touching sign Of holiest fellowship with him was—what? Wrathful contention? no! but love benign! “By this shall all men know that ye are mine!” LIII As for the common-place, heroic rant Of wreaths by fame twin'd round a warrior's head; Such move me not, if gather'd from a plant Nurtur'd by tears and blood; of valiant dead, Gloriously laid on honour's gory bed, From whence they look to Heav'n with noble pride: Of such things I have often heard and read, “In sorrow, not in anger;” misapplied Indeed, are words like these to men who thus have died! LIV “Die for thy country! thou romantic fool! Seize, seize one plank, thyself, and get to shore.” The bard upbraids not thus the hireling tool, Who fights for sordid pay, and asks no more; Content to fall as thousands fell before, And millions will, when he is senseless clay: But those of nobler natures would implore To pause, and seriously reflect, if they, By dying for its sake, a patriot's debt can pay. LV He pays it better, surely, who still lives, Blessing, and blest; who, in his humble sphere, To aid the poor his scanty pittance gives, Befriends the orphan, dries the widow's tear; Or if by poverty forbade to cheer, Even with trivial boons, the lot of woe, By kindness, and by sympathy sincere, Gives more, perhaps, than affluence can bestow, To mitigate those griefs the suff'rers only know. LVI And oh! how much of these have war's wide pest, And those harsh feelings from whence wars arise, Inflicted upon man! He who, at rest Under his vine or fig-tree, feasts his eyes On scenes of peace alone, can sympathize Imperfectly with all those horrors which Attend the foul, unnatural sacrifice, To Moloch offer'd, only to enrich The blood-stain'd altar plac'd before an idol's niche. LVII We read of battles won, and battles lost, “The Senate's thanks, the Gazette's pompous tale;” Our streets are by triumphal arches cross'd, The rustic quaffs his mug of nut-brown ale; Pride pours the wine-cup; music fills the gale; And all to celebrate a feat, which few, Who thus rejoice, could see, and not turn pale; Which many could not for a moment view, Nor cry “Forgive them God! they know not what they do.” LVIII Allow me therefore, reader, not to paint The scene itself, I will not trust so far My own imperfect powers of verse; too faint Even to sketch the actual strife of war; Where dying groans on music's concord jar: I would but paint a quiet, peaceful scene, Not meant, methinks, for man himself to mar; First, in its native loveliness serene; Last, as it may be found when glory there has been. LIX Come, take thy stand upon this gentle ridge, Which overlooks yon sweet secluded vale; Before us is a rude and rustic bridge, A simple plank; and by its side a rail On either hand, to guide the footsteps frail Of first or second childhood; while below The murm'ring brooklet tells its babbling tale, Like a sweet under-song, which, in its flow, It chanteth to the flowers that on its margin grow. LX For many a flow'ret blossoms there to bless The gentle loveliness whose charms imbue Its border;—strawberry of the wilderness; The star-like daisy; violet brightly blue; Pale primrose, in whose cup the pearly dew Glistens till noon-tide's languid, listless hour; And last of all, and sweetest to the view, The lily of the vale, whose virgin flower Trembles at every breeze within its leafy bower. LXI Now glance thine eye along the streamlet's banks Up through yon quiet valley; thou wilt trace Above, the giant mountains in their ranks, Of bold and varied outline; little space Below their summits, far above their base, Umbrageous woods; and, last of all, thine eye Will rest on many an humble dwelling-place Of happy human beings; and descry The lowly temple where they worship the Most High. LXII How quietly it stands within the bound Of its low wall of grey, and mossy stone! And like a shepherd's peaceful flock around Its guardian gather'd,—graves, or tombstones strown, Make their last narrow resting-places known, Who, living, lov'd it as a holy spot; And, dying, made their deep attachment shown By wishing here to sleep when life was not, That so their turf, or stone, might keep them unforgot! LXIII It is a bright and balmy afternoon, Approaching unto even-tide; and all Is still except that streamlet's placid tune, Or hum of bees, or lone wood-pigeon's call, Buried amid embow'ring forest tall, Which feathers, half way up, each hill's steep side: Dost thou not feel such landscape's soothing thrall; And wish, if not within its bowers t' abide, Atleast to explore its haunts, and know what joys they hide? LXIV Nor need'st thou wish a truer luxury Than in its depths, delighted, thou might'st share; I will not say that nought of agony, Blest as it is, at times may harbour there, For man is born to suffer, and to bear:— But could I go with thee from cot to cot, And show thee how this valley's inmates fare, Thou might'st confess, to live in such a spot, And die there in old age, were no unlovely lot. LXV But time suffices not to loiter so; Then let us take, as sample of the rest, That lowly hut, where blooming wall-flowers grow Above the ivy time has made its vest, Like glist'ning foam-wreaths on a green wave's crest: On one side of its porch, poor, old, and weak, A patriarch sits, in homely raiment drest; A woman opposite, whose faded cheek, Though younger far than his, some lines of sorrow streak. LXVI Yet in her form, once beautiful, is seen Still fair proportion, natural elegance; And though most matronly is now her mien, And meekly chasten'd is the downward glance Of her dark eye, who looks on it, perchance May well conjecture, from its beauty, how, Ere grief had dimm'd by painful circumstance Its lustre, from beneath its arching brow It sparkled at love's tale, fill'd at affection's vow. LXVII And though that cheek is not, as youth's may be, In blooming beauty drest, 'tis lovely yet; And whoso looks upon it, soon may see That disappointed hope, and keen regret; Have marr'd, but not effac'd, the charms that met In softest union on those features mild: Still may be traced the stamp which nature set Upon them, when sweet Agnes, then a child, Here warbled, like a bird, her carols free and wild. LXVIII She lov'd, and married one, who long had been First playmate, then companion;—only son, And child, of that old man before her seen; And for a time existence smoothly run In a calm current; children many a one Were theirs, and if not wealth, at least content; Childless, and widow'd, is she now; for none Of those rich blessings bounteous Heaven had lent, Are left to call her own,—one after one they went. LXIX But though it cost poor Agnes many tears To see first one and then another die Of those sweet children, loveliest of their peers, At least they seem'd so in a mother's eye; And though it was still deeper agony When the pale messenger the last time came To call her husband hence; no impious sigh Impeach'd Omnipotence: she felt His claim “Who gives, and takes away; and bless'd his holy name!” LXX The woes which God inflicts, he gives the power To bear; or would, did man but supplicate; And this the sufferer found; yet many an hour, Or casual incident, would lay in wait, As if to make her feel more desolate, In this her desolation, by the view Of happy objects, which her stript estate Renewedly recals; but patience too Is given to bear them all. This moment proves it true! LXXI Behold, two lovely children now have stray'd From some near cottage to that bowery tree; And Agnes sees them coming, half afraid To trust herself a sight like this to see: A girl, the eldest, who perhaps may be Ten summers old, assumes her sagest look, Sits down, and opens wide upon her knee Her youngling brother's well-conn'd spelling-book, Who turns from thence his eye to yonder bubbling brook. LXXII For sweetest flow'rets are up-springing there, Which he would rather pluck than learn to spell; But when he hears his teacher's lips declare That he shall have those flowers he loves so well, As guerdon of his labour—to compel His fix'd attention, there requires no more; The task is learnt, repeated; then pell-mell They scamper forth amid that shining store; His pupilage is past, her gravity is o'er. LXXIII Among those flowers the happy playmates quaff Delight as innocent as flowers are fair; And Agnes hears the frequent shout, the laugh, Break on the stillness of the balmy air. But now a tenderer scene ensues;—look where The sister quietly resumes her seat Under that tree of blameless knowledge there, And hears him, kneeling by her side, repeat His evening prayer to God, in lisping accents sweet! LXXIV That done, his rosy cheek the guileless boy Rests on her knee, upturns his eyes to hers, And glances of affection, truest joy, Between their hearts are still interpreters. The sun, meantime, behind those sable firs, Is softly sinking; but his lingering streak Is on those lovely children:—zephyr stirs The glistening locks which hide his cherub cheek, And many a kiss she prints, a sister's love to speak! LXXV This is no sight for Agnes to behold Unmov'd;—nor can she, viewing it, forget How her own darling us'd to be of old Just such, and so employ'd. But though regret May thrill her heart, its better hopes are set Upon its inward comforter and stay; She rises up, and going forth, has met Those young companions on their homeward way; They know her kindness well, and childhood's greetings pay. LXXVI She kisses each with tenderness, and smiles As meekness only can, when tears supprest Are felt—though viewless:—they, with gentle wiles Of playful innocence, by her carest, Whom next to their own parents they love best, Beguile her from herself;—till when they part Even she is sooth'd, nor thinks her lot unblest, Since still she can, though tears at seasons start, Partake in others' joys with no ungrateful heart! LXXVII Why do I linger o'er this portraiture Of idle fancy?—wherefore—but to show How much there is of beauty to allure In peaceful quietude; did man but know, And knowing, seek, what is most truly so. O much there is to be most thankful for, E'en in this world, despite of all its woe, Would we but love each other, and abhor Each harsh and cruel thought that leads to strife and war. LXXVIII But to that happy valley turn once more, When War's destroying angel there has been:— Had Winter's devastations, on the roar Of elements, alone, deform'd the scene; Still, in its ruins, it had worn the mien Such natural scourges mostly leave behind; Some of its features yet had smil'd serene, Ev'n in the absence of all human-kind, And with our darkest fears a hope might be combin'd. LXXIX Now its once rustic bridge is lopp'd away By some rude pioneer's regardless stroke; Each peaceful homestead, blest but yesterday, A shapeless mass of ruins, black with smoke: The graceful birch, tall pine, and sturdy oak, Which bosom'd the sweet hamlet, too, are hewn; And hideous, maim'd, half putrid corpses choke The murmuring brook, which, on that afternoon, Had music in its flow of most delightful tune. LXXX Nor have they spared the solitary tree, Beneath whose boughs that child her brother taught;— Agnes, the patient Agnes! where is she? And her old helpless father? He who caught, From her meek smiles and accents, feelings fraught With more than joy. Those lovely children too, Where are they all? We dare not trust our thought To tell their tale, nor follow fancy's clue; Lest e'en the very worst should fearfully prove true. LXXXI Perhaps—but why conjecture? can we guess Horrors more foul than War itself supplies? The blood of age staining its silver tress; Childhood, or fright, or famine's sacrifice; The ruin'd maiden's unavailing cries:— All these might be their lamentable lot, Whose home was late so lovely in our eyes: We know but this—they were! and here are not! And feel we stand indeed on an accursed spot! LXXXII O War! thou art indeed the deadliest curse Which Heaven can suffer, or the world endure; However pride thy glories may rehearse, Or hopes of fame thy votaries may allure. Volcano, earthquake, pestilence impure, Are evils; but they poison not the spring Of thought and feeling: lenient time may cure Their devastations; but to thine there cling Resentment, rooted hate, and each unholy thing. LXXXIII “But what,” perhaps some reader may exclaim, Weary at last of this digression long, “Has War to do with him, who gives its name And title to thy Poem?”—Am I wrong? Or are there not an almost countless throng Of thoughts, to which Napoleon's name gives rise, Blended with war?—on which the poet's song, The historian's page, alike should moralize, If either hope to please the virtuous or the wise? LXXXIV What is Napoleon now—admitting all His former talents, enterprise, and power? The time has been, nor distant, when the thrall Of his portentous name made monarchs cower, And tremble in the proudest palace-tower: Fate seem'd his fiat, fortune as his guide; And empire, held by suff'rance, was the dower Which, when he took unto himself a bride, He spared an elder throne, with cool, contemptuous pride. LXXXV What is he now? Ten years ago his death Had spread through Europe with a voice of thunder; Fame's trump had blazon'd with her loudest breath The tale; and many a captive, groaning under The conqueror's yoke, had snapt his chains asunder. Stupid indifference now supplies the place, In many minds, of that mute vacant wonder They then had known, what time they paus'd a space, Before they deem'd him dead, with solemn doubtful face. LXXXVI He dies upon a surf-surrounded rock! Far from each court, and every courtly ring; Far from the fields where once, in battle's shock, Death stalk'd around him, a familiar thing: His “eagle” long before had furl'd his wing; His “star of honour” set, to rise no more! Nor could a hope remain that time might bring Glory to either spell, as heretofore; Therefore to him the life of life itself was o'er. LXXXVII And we, who of his death the tidings hear, Receive them as a tale of times gone by, Which wakes nor joy, nor grief, nor hope, nor fear: And if in nobler hearts a passing sigh For such a lot reflection may supply, Few follow up that feeling to its source: The multitude, with undiscerning eye, See all around pursue its usual course, And care not for his death, nor thoughts it should enforce. LXXXVIII But if such life, succeeded by such end, Be void of interest like a thrice told tale; If it have nought to “bless mankind, or mend,” Ponder'd aright, and weigh'd in truth's just scale; Sermons are useless! homilies must fail! And man be uninstructed still, because He will not learn! May wiser thoughts prevail; And may our better feelings, as we pause To contemplate his course, teach wisdom's holier laws. LXXXIX Nor could there be a fitter time than this For genuine friends of peace to vindicate The truer policy, superior bliss, Of milder precepts; now when warfare's weight Has left on each exhausted, weary state, Its natural burthen — debt; and deeper woes Than statists can repair or calculate; While he, whose greatness from false glory rose, Illustrates, by his lot, the boons which war bestows. XC What can it give of glory, power, and fame,— And these are toys that make the heart-strings stir Of those who wish to win a hero's name,— Which on Napoleon it did not confer? It made him for a time the arbiter Of thrones and dynasties; and Fortune smil'd, As she may do on some who follow her Believing her existence,—thus beguil'd, Till in the end they know 'twas but a phantom wild. XCI Can any future conqu'ror vainly hope Success more brilliant than Napoleon won? Or think with power's temptations he shall cope, Nor blindly err as Fortune's child has done? Let him, with self-distrust, the trial shun. As darkness comes with night, and light with day, Power brings temptation; and, of mortals, none Entering on such a path can safely say, But so far will I go, and there my steps shall stay. XCII Nor unto kings alone, should such a fall As thine, Napoleon! timely warning teach; Though such a striking case may loudly call, Like Wisdom in the streets, to all, and each; Preaching, as facts alone have power to preach, Unwelcome truths. The people too, should learn Instruction when thus plac'd within the reach Of even humblest intellect; nor spurn The lesson it proclaims unto themselves in turn. XCIII “War is a game, which, were their subjects wise, Kings would not play at.” Not on kings, alone, Should rest the censure therefore. Truth supplies, Conscience admits, when candour cause has shown, Many apologies for monarchs prone To this delusive, dangerous foolishness: They have, like others, passions of their own; Little they risk,—and feel, and suffer less, And see not what they cause of vice, and deep distress. XCIV “War is a game, which, were their subjects wise, Kings would not play at.” Suffer me again, Reader! to quote a poet whom I prize; Nor fancy such a repetition vain. Of pride in kings 'tis folly to complain, And fling the blame of war upon their will, If those who see its evil, feel its pain, Instead of striving all they can to kill This baneful Upas tree, admire its grandeur still. XCV So long as kings have subjects who believe That war is glorious; peace is insecure! So long as poets victory's garlands weave, Or hist'ry's praise to martial fame allure, Or wealth be won by violence impure, Or, worst of all, the pulpit shall proclaim That war is guiltless: elements endure To foster deeds, which, spite of worldly fame, Crucify Christ afresh; put him to open shame. XCVI “War is a game, which, were their subjects wise, Kings” could “not play at.” Reader, mark that word! And having done so with impartial eyes; By sophistry and interest undeterr'd, Inquire how far thy folly has concurr'd, In any way to administer fresh force Unto this deadly evil. Hast thou stirr'd One finger to avert its fearful course? Hast thou e'er thought aright upon its hidden source? XCVII “What! would you then deny a sov'reign's right, Or cripple the resources of the state?” I would do neither; in the Christian's sight A patriot's duties all will concentrate To one bright centre! I hold no debate On Cæsar's dues as paid to Cæsar's throne: He who imagines I would desecrate What good men name with deferential tone, But vilifies my aim: nor libels me alone; XCVIII He does a gross injustice to the cause Of throne and altar; which fears no appeal Unto those peaceable and righteous laws The Prince of Peace descended to reveal, His life their comment, and his death their seal! And in their spirit, only, I would win Those who most deeply their importance feel, To trace the progress of this deadly sin From its polluted source where all its woes begin. XCIX For “Whence come wars and fightings? come they not From your own lusts?”—Believing this, can we Blindly imagine that they fling no blot On Christian faith, and hope, and charity? If by its fruits we are to know the tree, Can that be fitly call'd the tree of life, Whose foliage Scripture has declar'd to be For “healing of the nations,” which is rife With falsehood, anger, pride, and all unholy strife? C Believe it not: there can be no accord 'Twixt Christ and Belial. Now, as heretofore, There is “one faith, one baptism, and one Lord!” That faith still works by love; and is no more Where love is not: that baptism would restore, Even though it be of fire, through love divine; And that one Lord remains, as known of yore, The high and holy priest of love's pure shrine; Whose mild response is this: “Your love declares you mine!” CI But some, perhaps, may say, “We know that war Is anti-Christian; knew it long ago; And all the wise and virtuous must abhor The crimes and miseries it inflicts below. But, while we deprecate its vice and woe, We can do nothing to avert the pest; Perhaps in time Almighty Power may show, By some new dispensation, how unblest Its lawless triumphs are, and give creation rest.” CII To this I answer,—Christians cannot need, And have no right to anticipate on earth, Another dispensation, law, or creed, Than that which has already issued forth, Whose light to immortality gave birth! As to the plea that frail and finite man Can do but little, while we own its worth, Let us inquire if, on the Gospel plan, That little has been done? Have we done all we can? CIII Let each, to whom the cause of peace is dear, That cause with patient meekness advocate; And, in his own immediate humble sphere, Endeavour that his life may illustrate His best conceptions of that happier state, Which meekness, long-forbearance, kindness, love, Alone can introduce: with calmness wait, Attempting not in human strength to move In that which is His work, who dwells and reigns above. CIV “There is a might which the world little heeds, The irresistible armour of the weak, Who only dare move onwards as God leads; As He gives utterance, only dare to speak.” These shall experience that unto the meek, The pillar of whose hopes seems rent and riven, That holy, pure, inheritance they seek, By Him, who cannot lie, was long since given; And in his strength they strive, and patiently have striven. CV Art thou a father? Teach thy sons that this Makes Christian Heroes! Made such by his might Whose peaceful empire is man's perfect bliss; For easy is his yoke, his burthen light. Allow them not in infancy to slight Even trivial acts of natural brotherhood, And childish kindnesses: stain in their sight All honours won by waste of human blood, And teach them those are great, whom God hath first made good! CVI But I must turn me, it is time, to thee, Who gav'st this verse its title, and its theme: And doing so, I could desire to be Preserv'd alike from either rash extreme. I cannot think upon thee with the esteem Thy talents should have won thee; and the page, Which for a fallen enemy could teem With scorn; or with the dead its warfare wage; Would shame the bard, not thee, and unbefit the age. CVII In truth, thou wast not one for common men To look on with contempt: though not a few In senates, from the pulpit, with the pen, Have heap'd upon thee scorn and hatred too; Denying thee the tribute justly due To genius, enterprise, and energy:— Forgetting still, in such distorted view, They could not these consistently deny, Without admitting all their absence must imply. CVIII It were, indeed, a dubious compliment Unto thy foes, such falsehoods to assert, Because, if unto them we yield assent, Can sophistry the inference avert, That nought but imbecility inert, On their part who oppos'd thee, was thy rise, And made thee, by degrees, the thing thou wert? Thou didst not reach this by thy own emprise Alone; nor was thy fall achiev'd by enemies. CIX From circumstances, complicate in kind, In part thy marvellous success arose: These, with no common powers in thee combin'd, First pav'd thy path; and as with power still grows Ambition's daring, which not only shows More to be won; but gives, as sure effect, The will to win, the pride that scorns repose: Thou wouldst be of thy fate the architect, Until thy Babel tower was all in ruins wreck'd. CX Do I exult in this? O! if I do, It is not in a foe-man's bitter mood; But as a friend to freedom; in whose view Thou, as her deadly enemy, hast stood, Conspicuous in those countless fields of blood, The sad aceldamas of latter days: And having been such, then man's general good Compels me, though I pity while I gaze, To own the lesson just, a fall like thine displays. CXI But, beyond this, I know no exultation, Nor have I aught of pleasure in thy fall; Except in hoping that its contemplation May teach the world, promote the good of all. If they who held thee recently in thrall, Such power abus'd, or still remain untaught; Theirs is a penalty which should appal The truly noble, viewing, as they ought, Thee, and themselves in turn, with sober, serious thought. CXII This must be left for time to demonstrate, And history, in her annals, to declare; I neither seek to blame, nor vindicate Thy exile and captivity; nor dare Pronounce upon the fruit they seem to bear In others' conduct:—fruitless if they be, Even Hope herself might for mankind despair; For those who have learnt nothing, viewing thee, Possess not hearts that feel, nor eyes that truly see. CXIII Such must acquire instruction in the school Of sad experience, which makes dearly wise, Flashing conviction on the veriest fool Who dupes himself by solemn vanities;— Unrav'lling all the flimsy sophistries By which the worldly wise each other cheat; Yet wiser, sure, is he who so applies Unto himself the ills that others meet; Than him who blunders on, untaught by their defeat. CXIV Yet unto thee, Napoleon! once again I turn with feelings inexpressible; And, long as may appear this parting strain, So deeply do I feel the potent spell Its theme supplies; unwearied I could dwell On thoughts it wakens:—and I linger yet, Before I can pronounce a last “farewell!” Like one before whose mournful gaze is set A thing he must forego, but not so soon forget. CXV Forget! No, never! Thou hast left behind, If not a glorious, yet a deathless name; Which almost seems as if it were design'd To show the world the nothingness of fame; And unto ages yet unborn proclaim That he who builds, in fortune's brightest hour, And with a master's skill, the monstrous frame Of arbitrary will, and lawless power, Toils in a worthless cause, and rears a tottering tower. CXVI Like his, who built his house upon the sands, Foolishly trusting such foundation sure, The splendid fabric, rear'd by servile hands. To honour despotism, and allure The gaze of sycophants, can not endure! When rude adversity's bleak storms descend, It falls, because its base is insecure; Unblest alike its origin and end,— That to no joys gave birth, on this no griefs attend. CXVII Thou shouldst have known this; and have ponder'd well, Before unwieldy empire made thee proud, That power usurp'd, howe'er it seem'd to swell Thy strength, was weakness! minds remain unbow'd To slavery's yoke; and, in the dark'ning cloud Which blacken'd the horizon, still was set The bow of promise, with a voice endow'd, Pronouncing calmly words with welcome met, “The flood shall cease—the dove bring back her olive yet!” CXVIII Since this has been accomplish'd, may the past Suffice to teach us wisdom; if it may, The lesson of thy downfal shall outlast All the seduction of thine earlier day; And thy example strikingly display The power of Him who useth at his will, With wisdom infinite, man's feeble sway; And, making all his purposes fulfil, Is of the world he form'd Almighty Sovereign still! MINOR POEMS. “The moving accident is not my trade; To freeze the blood I have no ready arts: 'Tis my delight alone, in summer shade, To pipe a simple song for thinking hearts.” Wordsworth. TO ELIZA. I would not, love! prefix a name like thine To verse that dwelt on ills which flow from strife; That name is one Affection would entwine Among those lovelier things that sweeten life. But these, with feelings of fraternal love, And with an author's mingled hopes and fears, These I to thee would offer—May they prove Dear to thy heart for “days of other years!” B. B. TO THE SUN. I Monarch of day! once rev'rently ador'd By virtuous Pagans, if no longer thou With orisons art worshipp'd, as the lord Of the delightful lyre, or dreadful bow; If thy embodied essence be not now, As it once was, regarded as divine; Nor blood of victims at thine altar flow, Nor clouds of incense hover round thy shrine, Yet fitly may'st thou claim the homage of the Nine. II Nor can I deem it strange, that in past ages Men should have knelt and worshipp'd thee; that kings, And laurell'd bards, robed priests, and hoary sages, Should, far above all sublunary things, Have turn'd to thee, whose radiant glory flings Its splendour over all. Ere Gospel light Had dawn'd, and given to thought sublimer wings, I cannot marvel, in that mental night, That nations should obey, and nature own thy right. III For man was then, as now he is, compell'd By conscious frailties manifold, to seek Something to worship. In the heart, unquell'd By innate evil, thoughts there are which speak One language in Barbarian, Goth, or Greek; A language by the heart well understood, Proclaiming man is helpless, frail, and weak, And urging him to bow to stone, or wood, Till what his hands had form'd his heart rever'd as good. IV Do I commend idolatry? — O no! I merely would assert the human heart Must worship: that its hopes and fears will go Out of itself, and restlessly depart In search of somewhat which its own fond art, Tradition, custom, or sublimer creed Of Revelation brings, to assuage the smart With which its inward wounds too often bleed, When nature's boasted strength is found a broken reed. V Can it be wondrous, then, before the name Of the eternal God was known, as now, That orisons were pour'd, and votaries came To offer at thine altars, and to bow Before an object beautiful as thou? No, it was natural, in those darker days, For such to wreathe around thy phantom brow A fitting chaplet of thine arrowy rays, Shaping thee forth a form to accept their prayer or praise. VI Even I, majestic Orb! who worship not The splendour of thy presence, who control My present feelings, as thy future lot Is painted to the vision of my soul, When final darkness, like an awful scroll, Shall quench thy fires;—even I, if I could kneel To aught but Him who fram'd this wondrous whole, Could worship thee; so deeply do I feel Emotions, words alone are powerless to reveal. VII For thou art glorious! when from thy pavilion Thou lookest forth at morning; flinging wide Its curtain clouds of purple and vermilion, Dispensing light and life on every side; Brightening the mountain cataract, dimly spied Through glittering mist, opening each dew-gemm'd flower, Or touching, in some hamlet, far descried, Its spiral wreaths of smoke that upward tower, While birds their matins sing from many a leafy bower. VIII And more magnificent art thou, bright Sun! Uprising from the ocean's billowy bed: Who, that has seen thee thus, as I have done, Can e'er forget the effulgent splendours spread From thy emerging radiance? Upwards sped, E'en to the centre of the vaulted sky, Thy beams pervade the heavens, and o'er them shed Hues indescribable — of gorgeous dye, Making among the clouds mute, glorious pageantry. IX Then, then how beautiful, across the deep, The lustre of thy orient path of light! Onward, still onward, o'er the waves that leap So lovelily, and show their crests of white, The eye, unsated, in its own despite, Still up that vista gazes; till thy way Over the waters, seems a pathway bright For holiest thoughts to travel, there to pay Man's homage unto Him who bade thee “rule the day.” X And thou thyself, forgetting what thou art, Appear'st thy Maker's temple, in whose dome The silent worship of the expanding heart May rise, and seek its own eternal home: The intervening billows' snowy foam, Rising successively, seem steps of light, Such as on Bethel's plain the angels clomb; When, to the slumb'ring patriarch's ravish'd sight, Heaven's glories were reveal'd in visions of the night. XI Nor are thy evening splendours, mighty Orb! Less beautiful: and oh! more touching far, And of more power thought, feeling to absorb In silent ecstacy, to me they are; When, watchful of thy exit, one pale star Shines on the brow of summer's loveliest eve; And breezes, softer than the soft guitar, Whose plaintive notes Castilian maids deceive, Among the foliage sigh, and take of thee their leave. XII Oh! then it is delightful to behold Thy calm departure; soothing to survey Through opening clouds, by thee all edged with gold, The milder pomp of thy declining sway: How beautiful, on church-tower old and grey, Is shed thy parting smile; how brightly glow Thy last beams on some tall tree's loftiest spray, While silvery mists half veil the trunk below, And hide the rippling stream that scarce is heard to flow! XIII This may be mere description; and there are Who of such poesy but lightly deem; And think it nobler in a bard, by far, To seek in narrative a livelier theme: These think, perchance, the poet does but dream, Who paints the scenes most lovely in his eyes, And, knowing not the joys with which they teem, The charm their quiet loveliness supplies, Insipid judge his taste, his simple strain despise. XIV I quarrel not with such. If battle fields, Where crowns are lost and won; or potent spell Which portraiture of stormier passion yields; If such alone can bid their bosoms swell With those emotions words can feebly tell, Enough there are who sing such themes as these, Whose loftier powers I seek not to excel; I neither wish to fire the heart, nor freeze; But seek their praise alone, whom gentler thoughts can please. XV But if the quiet study of the heart, And love sincere of nature's softer grace, Have not deceiv'd me, these have power to impart Feelings and thoughts well worthy of a place In every bosom: he who learns to trace, Through all he sees, that hand which form'd the whole, While contemplating fair Creation's face, Feels its calm beauty ruder thoughts control, And touch the mystic chords which vibrate through the soul. XVI Majestic Orb! when, at the tranquil close Of a long day in irksome durance spent, I've wander'd forth, and seen thy disk repose Upon the vast horizon, while it lent Its glory to the kindling firmament, While clouds on clouds, in rich confusion roll'd, Encompass'd thee as with a gorgeous tent, Whose most magnificent curtains would unfold, And form a vista bright, through which I might behold XVII Celestial visions — Then the wondrous story Of Bunyan's Pilgrims seem'd a tale most true; How he beheld their entrance into glory, And saw them pass the pearly portal through; Catching, meanwhile, a beatific view Of that bright city, shining like the sun, Whose glittering streets appear'd of golden hue, Where spirits of the just, their conflicts done, Walk'd in white robes, with palms, and crowned every one. XVIII Past is that vision:—Views of heavenly things Rest not in glories palpable to sense; To something dearer Hope exulting springs, With joy chastis'd by humble diffidence; Not robes, nor palms, give rapture so intense As thought of meeting, never more to part, Those we have lov'd on earth; the influence Of whose affection o'er the subject heart, Was by mild virtue gain'd, and sway'd with gentle art. XIX Once more unto my theme. I turn again To Thee, appointed ruler of the day! For time it is to close this lingering strain, And I, though half reluctantly, obey. Still, not thy rise, and set, alone, though they Are most resplendent, claim thy votary's song; The bard who makes thee subject of his lay, Unless he would a theme so glorious wrong, Will find it one that wakes of thoughts a countless throng. XX For can imagination upward soar To thee, and to thy daily path on high, Nor feel, if it have never felt before, Warm admiration of thy majesty? Thy home is in the beautiful blue sky! From whence thou lookest on this world of ours, As but a satellite thy beams supply With light and gladness; thy exhaustless powers Call forth in other worlds sweet Spring's returning flowers! XXI Yes — as in this, in other worlds the same, The Seasons do thee homage — each in turn: Spring, with a smile, exults to hear thy name; Then Summer woos thy bright, but brief sojourn, To bless her bowers; while deeper ardours burn On Autumn's glowing cheek when thou art nigh; And even Winter half foregoes his stern And frigid aspect, as thy bright'ning eye Falls on his features pale, nor can thy power deny. XXII Yet though on earth thou hast beheld the sway Of time, which alters all things; and may'st look On Pyramids as piles of yesterday, Which were not in thy youth: although no nook Of earth, perchance, retain the form it took When first thou didst behold it: even thou Must know, in turn, thy strength and glory strook; Must lose the radiant crown that decks thy brow, Day's regal sceptre yield, and to a Mightier bow! XXIII For thou thyself art but a thing of time, Whose birth with thine one awful moment blended; Together ye began your course sublime, Together will that course sublime be ended. For, soon or late, have oracles portended, One final consummation ye shall meet: When into nothingness ye have descended, This mighty world shall melt with fervent heat, Its revolutions end, its cycle be complete. XXIV And then shall dawn Heaven's everlasting day, Illum'd with splendour far surpassing thine; For He who made thee shall Himself display, And in the brightness of his glory shine. Redeem'd from grief and sin by Love Divine, Before his throne shall countless thousands bend; And space itself become one holy shrine, Whence in harmonious concord shall ascend To God, and to The Lamb, praise, glory without end! TO JOHN BOWRING, ESQ. ON HIS TRANSLATION OF THE RUSSIAN ANTHOLOGY. I Bowring! it was an honourable task From the bleak regions of the north to bear A wreath, whose beauty well deserv'd to bask In brighter sunshine, and in balmier air. II And well hast thou perform'd it. Thanks to thee, Poets, whose names had grated on my ear, Till thou hadst made them musical to me, Are now fireside companions, priz'd, and dear. III Derzhavin's noble numbers, soaring high, Replete with inspiration's genuine force, And Batiushkov's milder melody, Warm from domestic pleasure's sweetest source: IV These, and with them names dissonant and dire To English ears, are now delightful things; Awakening thoughts congenial to the lyre, And, better still, hope's warm imaginings. V Yes, hope for the extension of that good Which cultivated taste and thought dispense; For these, if rightly train'd, and understood, Must nourish virtue and benevolence. VI Therefore do I rejoice: believing this, That poesy's enchanting art was given To be, on earth, the source of blameless bliss, And cherish thoughts which lift the soul to heaven. VII Nor am I lonely in this cheerful creed, For thou art one who know'st the purer power Of lofty song, and I have heard thee plead, With eloquence, the Muses' noblest dower. VIII Not for its literary worth alone, Hast thou, with generous emulation, brought This flow'ry wreath from Russia's frigid zone; To thee with deeper charms its bloom was fraught. IX A heart like thine delightedly must dwell Upon those liberal feelings, tranquil joys, Which, in the peasant's cottage, student's cell, May bless the mind that thus its power employs. X Thou couldst not but rejoice to find in haunts, “Where Winter sits upon his throne of snow,” Those thoughts and feelings Nature kindly plants In hearts that stifle not her genial glow. XI To thee it was refreshing to behold, In realms where slav'ry mars man's better powers, Those germs of mind, thus vent'ring to unfold, Which may hereafter burst in beauteous flowers; XII Flowers of delightful fragrance; fit to twine Around the capitals in Freedom's fane; When Freedom there shall find an honour'd shrine, And knowledge break the links of slav'ry's chain. XIII Russia may yet be free! Nor frigid clime, Nor autocrat's decrees, can e'er impede Of mental energy the march sublime; Its glorious records he who runs may read. XIV In rising states, if pure each hidden source Of knowledge, and of freedom, every hour Aids their resistless, animating course; Strong, in the weakness of opposing power. XV Triumphant, not through force of arms, but by The power of truth, the silent lapse of time; Bloodless and glorious is their victory, The fame their votaries win — indeed sublime. XVI And well may thy benignant bosom feel That such achievements richly merit more Than to be hail'd by trumpet's loudest peal, Or echoing artillery's thundering roar. XVII They should hand down the deathless names of those Who may accomplish them, to distant years; Adorn'd with brightness truth alone bestows; Renown unpurchased but by grateful tears. XVIII Russia some future Alfred yet may boast, Whose deeds may truly dignify her throne; She yet may own of honour'd names an host, And shine, the glory of a frigid zone. XIX Meanwhile be thine the praise of having borne Some of her early flowers of poesy To blossom in a region less forlorn, “Beneath our Albion's more benignant sky.” TO C. B. T. I High hopes, and noble thoughts, are thine; These Fortune could not take, Nor would her gifts adorn the shrine That such will not forsake. Defying Fate's and Fortune's will; What first was fair, is glorious still. II But what is Fortune? what is Fate? The Christian knows them not: He knows a Being, good as great, Controls his earthly lot: No fabled phantom's vain caprice Assails his joy, or mars his peace. III What though, dear Charles! thy morn so bright, Ere noon be somewhat shaded: Its tenderest bloom, its truest light, Remain undimm'd, unfaded: These brightly shine, and sweetly glow, And, keeping them, how rich art thou! IV Before I met thee, what I heard Had waken'd vain regret, And sympathy within was stirr'd For thee; but, when we met, I should have blush'd to own that I Had ever thought of sympathy. V I could have look'd at thee, my friend! With envy and with pride, But names so odious ill may blend With feelings gratified: And mine were such, for I was taught To bless thee, in my inmost thought. VI Whom the Lord loveth, in his love He chasteneth. Every son Adopted by our Sire above, That sonship thus hath won: Nor was the chastisement severe Which left thee much most truly dear. VII Am I too serious? surely not: If so, what may we trust? Hast thou not chosen as thy lot An office most august? And enter'd on its functions, now, Where much should sanctify each vow? VIII The altar where thou minist'rest, The walls that echo round Each syllable by thee express'd, Stand they on holy ground? It is regarded so by thee, In one sense it is such to me. IX Forgive me if I honour not, As thou may'st, outward things; Or if, while standing on such spot, My recollection clings To one, whose memory, in my sight, Eclipses the most splendid rite. X No consecrating ritual's art, No anthem's echoing peal, Could, to the feelings of my heart, That hidden spell reveal, Which, though thy creed is not my own, Here wakens thought's sublimest tone. XI Thy creed not mine! the thought recal; Its essence is the same; On truths most awful unto all, We differ but in name: And these enjoin us to revere A spot by martyr'd worth made dear. XII Not to revere, as may have been The case in days gone by, With superstition's darken'd mien; But with a heavenward eye To Him, the Giver of all good, For whom that martyr nobly stood. XIII Thou bear'st his name; thou standest where He stood; — his worth recal; May'st thou his deep devotion share, On thee his mantle fall: For unto it more virtue clings Than to the ermin'd robes of kings! TO C. H. TOWNSEND, ON HIS VERSES TO THE SETTING SUN, INCLUDED IN THE VOLUME OF HIS POEMS RECENTLY PUBLISHED. I Yes! Bard of Nature's vesper hour, Of day's superb decline; There are who own its thrilling power With feelings such as thine. II Who view that orb as thou hast done, When sinking from our skies; Who, when his westward goal is won, Gaze there with wistful eyes. III Were it not thus, thy touching lay By none were understood, Nor would it human bosoms sway To thought's most soothing mood. IV But breathing, as it does, a tone To Nature's votaries dear, It falls with magic all its own Upon the spirit's ear. V And on their hearts, whose eyes have dwelt On day's declining light, Its gentle music seems to melt Like softest dews of night; VI Which nourish by their genial powers The meadow's emerald green, The loveliness of languid flowers, The charm of every scene. VII And thus it surely ought to be; Still, in these worldly days, There are who have not bow'd the knee In Mammon's venal praise. VIII Who have not barter'd mind's true health, Feeling's exhaustless dower, Imagination's glorious wealth; For riches, pomp, or power! IX These love, unto the world unknown, To live in Nature's eye; And, feeling Nature's God their own, In peace with Him to die! X To them, in ocean, sky, and air, Exist unnumber'd spells; In every thing, and every where, One mighty Spirit dwells! XI His brightness makes more truly bright The beauty of the morn; When dew-drops, gemm'd by rays of light, Bespangle every thorn. XII The stillness of the noontide hour Is Nature's silent hymn To God; without whose mighty power Her splendours all were dim. XIII And, in the Sun's serene decline, Its loveliest hues reprove Those who can view its beams benign, Nor feel that “God is Love!” XIV Who, gazing on the Sun's last beams, Feels not that they impart More than the Poet's sweetest dreams, Or proudest works of art? XV He seems to say, “Fair world, adieu! “I have fulfill'd my trust, “And given my glorious light unto “The just, and the unjust. XVI “My bounty may have been abus'd, “Unfelt, or unconfess'd; “And all my glory but amus'd “Hearts which it should have bless'd. XVII “But I reproach not: yet one more “Last effort would I make, “And win the thoughtless to adore “Our Maker, for my sake!” XVIII And then, magnificently bright, Benignantly serene; All that can lure the wond'ring sight, Gives beauty to the scene. XIX Well might'st thou, Minstrel! own how weak The power that words supply; Well might “a smile be on thy cheek,” “A tear be in thine eye.” XX For, oh! the most subduing power, The most harmonious tone, Of such an harmonizing hour Can but in thought be known. XXI But unto thought that Sun then seems A type and emblem true Of Him who gave its brightest beams, Its softest radiance too. XXII Like Him, it sheds its warmth and light On all that breathes and lives; Though they forgetfully may slight What hour by hour it gives. XXIII Like Him, before its beams depart, On eyes long turn'd away, It opens scenes to touch the heart,— Would man confess their sway. XXIV And those who own their deepest spell, With thoughts that upward soar, Feeling far more than words can tell, Must silently adore! [While this sheet is passing through the press, a notice of Townsend's Poems in the Monthly Review has fallen in my way: in it the Reviewer observes, “Mr. Townsend writes like a gentleman, a scholar, and a poet.” On his claims to the two former characters, however consonant to my feelings, I do not affect to offer an opinion; for his poetry, I return him, most cordially, my thanks.] STANZAS ON THE APPROACH OF WINTER. I 'Tis Autumn! and the short'ning day, The chilly evening's sober gray, And winds that hoarser blow; The fading foliage of the trees, Which rustles sere in every breeze, The approach of Winter show. II Adieu to those more cheerful hours, Spent amid Spring's unfolding flowers, Or Summer's soothing shade; A few short weeks, — and then adieu To fields and groves of changeful hue, By Autumn's hand array'd! III But welcome — welcome unto Thee! Whose undisputed sov'reignty Must briefly be confess'd; Who, though thou wear'st a look austere, Of all the seasons of the year By me art lov'd the best. IV I own that I shall somewhat miss The quiet and secluded bliss Autumnal eves supply: When meadow, valley, hill, and grove, Disclose, to those who o'er them rove, A harvest for the eye! V And deeper is the hush'd delight, When, with her mild and mellowing light, The full-orb'd moon on high In gentle majesty comes forth, Shedding her beauty on the earth, Her glory through the sky. VI Yes; I have felt the charm serene, Yielded by such delightful scene; Yet not the less I prize, Stern Winter! pleasures all thy own, Or which, in fullest zest, are known Beneath thy frowning skies. VII Even abroad, thy short-liv'd day At times will loveliness display, To me as truly dear, As that, more palpable to sense, Spring, Summer, Autumn, can dispense, To deck the changeful year. VIII How beautiful thy frosty morn, When brilliants gem each feathery thorn! How fair thy cloudless noon! And through the leafless trees, at night, With more than Summer's soften'd light, Shines thy resplendent moon. IX To me thy snowy landscapes teem With beauty, though no sunny beam Illume their aspect chill; They have a beauty to the heart; In the deep quiet they impart Stillness appears more still! X But thou hast other joys than these, Which they can scarcely fail to seize Who most improve thy sway; Joys which are found and felt within, And home-born pleasures, that begin With thy departing day. XI Thou gath'rest round the cheerful fire Daughter and Mother, Son and Sire; Names which themselves express Some of our nature's dearest ties; Whose influence to the heart supplies Its choicest happiness. XII Yes; “King of intimate delights, Fire-side enjoyments!” stormy nights But aid thy potent thrall; Thou holdest then thy regal court, With tale and converse, laugh and sport, Christmas, thy Carnival! XIII But from each jocund festive scene, Whose charms delightfully have been Described in many a strain, I turn me to the silent cell Of him who feels that hidden spell Which binds the Muses' train. XIV Look in that room, if it may be So term'd, where little room we see; And mark the medley there; With scraps of paper, scribbled o'er, Strew'd are the table, desk, and floor, And one else vacant chair. XV Its master in the other sits; Ransacks his memory, racks his wits For simile, or rhyme; Now writes a line, now rubs it out; Now o'er another hangs in doubt; Nor heeds, nor thinks of time. XVI Turn'st thou from such a scene with scorn, Reader! or does such lot forlorn Thy sympathy awake? The former he would scarcely heed; The latter might too fondly feed A flame 'twere wise to slake. XVII 'Tis past the noon of night, and yet He seems, while writing, to forget The silent lapse of hours; And that a tenement of clay, Prone to derangement and decay, Contains his mental powers. XVIII But he is happy, for the time, Thus bodying forth in simple rhyme Feelings and thoughts, which seem To bring before his spirit's eye Scenes, objects, persons, long gone by, Each, in its turn, his theme. XIX Not “cribb'd in, cabin'd, and confin'd,” By that small closet's bounds, his mind, In winter's long dark night, Unfolds its wings; and fancy flies Where landscapes, under summer-skies, Bask in its sunshine bright. XX Perhaps some haunt, to boyhood dear, Unvisited for many a year, In fancy he surveys; Or, dearer still, he seems to greet Those whom in thought 'tis joy to meet, The friends of former days. XXI He holds delightful converse, too, With some whom he no more may view, The lov'd, the long-since dead; Yet such exist to him, thus brought Before the vision of his thought, Though they from earth are fled. XXII What is to him, in such an hour, The frown which may hereafter lower Upon a critic's brow? It then may mortify his pride, Or be with keener pangs supplied; But it is harmless now. XXIII For he but fancies, now, how such A thought, or sentiment, may touch The fancy, or the heart Of friend, or more than friend, from whom He, by life's chance, or darker doom, Has long liv'd far apart. XXIV Perhaps a half-encourag'd thrill Of hope, more elevated still, May cause a transient glow; Thoughts undefinable, which seek For words in vain; he dares not speak Of what to him they show. XXV They whisper to his willing ear, (Whose could be clos'd to sounds so dear?) That when his mortal frame Shall be to kindred dust consign'd, He yet may hope to leave behind The relic of a name! XXVI A name, not held in splendid trust By trophied urn, or sculptur'd bust, 'Mid statesmen's, chiefs', and kings',— But one that some few hearts may prize, When death has darkly seal'd his eyes, Among their cherish'd things. XXVII Not as the name of one who soar'd To realms or regions unexplor'd; But who was well content To trace those humbler veins of thought And feeling, which to him were fraught With pleasures innocent. XXVIII And thus is he absorb'd, and this To him is intellectual bliss; By sympathy intense To feel that intercourse which binds Heart unto heart; with other minds To hold intelligence. XXIX “Luckless enthusiast! enjoy, As best thou mayst, thy fond employ; Give thought and fancy scope: Explore imagination's source; And hold delightful intercourse With that sweet flatterer—Hope! XXX “But know thou this! the dreams that bless These hours of silent loneliness, So cherish'd by thy heart— Have little in them to engage Those who, on life's more busy stage, Perform an active part. XXXI “Can retrospections of the past, Before existence was o'ercast By vain anxiety, Be priz'd by any, but the few Who oft look back, with pensive view, To cloudless infancy? XXXII “Can those lov'd haunts, which muse of thine Would give in artless verse to shine, By tourists all unknown; Delightful as they are to thee, In other eyes expect to be Lovely, as in thine own? XXXIII “Can passions chasten'd, feelings curb'd, Thoughts, by no feverish dreams disturb'd, Aspire to gratify Those, whom 'twere easier to beguile By writhing lips, demoniac smile, And lightning of the eye? XXXIV “Or, ‘last, not least;’ what chance is thine 'Mid loftier votaries of the Nine, Who fill the trump of Fame; That thou the idle wish shouldst own, By rank, wealth, fashion, all unknown, To raise thyself a name? XXXV “Resign the bootless task! nor keep Those wakeful eyes from balmy sleep; Leave, leave thy close-pent room! Curtail not thy brief span of life, By useless, thankless, hopeless strife; Oblivion is thy doom! XXXVI “But 'tis in vain! Then fare thee well! I can but mourn that such a spell Resistless seems to be: Yet, since it is so, may thy toil Repay thee with an ampler spoil Than mine e'er brought to me. XXXVII “And may those purer hopes, that cheer Thy winter evenings, else most drear, Not pass like phantoms by; But mayst thou, when to earth consign'd, Some blameless record leave behind, Which shall not wholly die!” SONNET, WRITTEN ON THE FIRST LEAF OF A VOLUME OF CHARLES LLOYD'S POETRY. Reader! if thou wouldst know the genuine worth Of the rich treasures that await thee here, Thou first must have thy mental eye and ear Anointed, and unseal'd; must know the birth Of better feelings than belong to earth, And breathe in thought's sublimer atmosphere: Be such thy mood, and thou wilt find no dearth Of pure delight, thy heart may long hold dear. But if thou art a worldling, and hast never Felt joys and sorrows, which are not of time, But born of feelings that must be for ever! Betake thee to some more amusing rhyme, Which has no shadowy clouds for light to sever, Nor holds high colloquy with thoughts sublime! BENHALL. A SONNET. Benhall! although I have not lately sought, As I had purpos'd, thy delightful shades, Their charms survive; and oft by memory's aids, In living beauty are before me brought. No breeze that sweeps their flowers with perfume fraught; Nor sun, nor moon-beam, whose soft light pervades The coy recesses of thy loveliest glades, Sweeter, or fairer, than thou art to thought! Yet, not thy scenery only thus endears Thy memory,—deeper spell remains behind: Rich art thou in the lore of long-past years, The songs of bards, whose brows by Fame are twin'd With deathless bays: and, worthy such compeers, A poet of thy own — of taste refin'd. SONNET. TO AUGUSTA M—. It was a beautiful and balmy day, When I was privileg'd with Thee to roam The maze of fairy-land which guards thy home, Nor will its memory lightly pass away. A sonnet's narrow bounds can ill portray, Nor could a fashionably printed tome Of slender size, how lovelily heaven's dome, Earth's softest charms, shone forth in sweet display! O! many an object which then met my view, Memory has since by her delightful thrall, In brighter tints than its then lovely hue Of sabbath sunshine, failed not to recal; And with them, evermore, are present too Thou, and thy happy boy, my guides through all! TO ? ?, ESQ. I Can I publish a volume of verse, and refrain From recording one tribute to thee, Who hast long been, in moments of pleasure and pain, Unchang'd in thy friendship to me? II O, no! though forbidden to utter thy name, But one thought of it seems to give birth To each wish the most grateful affection can frame, In rememb'ring thy kindness and worth. III How can I be silent? In deserts forlorn The flowers ope their leaves to the Sun, Whose beams give them beauty and life every morn, Though their homage be witness'd by none. IV And though night-dews, which foster their fragrance, may seem All unthought-of to fall from the sky, Yet their pearl-drops, emblazon'd by morning's glad beam, Will betray them when night have pass'd by. V Thus hearts, which in friendship's warm sun-shine have flourish'd, Must revive when its brightness appears; And feelings its soft dews have silently nourish'd Must break forth,—if it be but in tears. VI And this rude harp of mine, if I dar'd not to pour For thy virtues the song I now frame, Might, touch'd by the murmuring breezes, say more, And reproachfully whisper thy name! TO THE AUTHOR OF “MAY YOU LIKE IT.” I No vulgar boon does he bestow, Who thus to manhood's stormy strife Recals those feelings, whose first glow Blest early life. II O, many a blast has blighted mine! Yet seem'd I, as I linger'd o'er These pages which develop thine, To feel once more! III To feel how holy is the dower Of love, and truth, and tenderness; How godlike is their gentle power The heart to bless. IV Thou art not one of those who deem That all our nature's dearest ties Are things which, on the Gospel scheme, Man should despise. V Thou wouldst unto religion give Each winning charm, that can supply Our happiness while here we live, Hope—when we die. VI Believing that the human heart To him who made it still is dear, Thou wouldst allure its better part By love sincere. VII Even in many—stain'd by sin, Lost, in the rigid bigot's sight, Thou seest a feeling yet—to win, Which would do right! VIII Thou know'st how such, at times, recal, With bitterness of soul, the past; And how they loathe, at times, the thrall Which binds them fast. IX And thou wouldst gently loose each bond, By painting, to their wistful view, Feelings as tender, pure and fond, As once they knew. X Then, while contrition melts the heart, And purer joys the hopes allure, 'Tis thine, with blameless, childish art, To point the cure. XI Well—“He who winneth souls is wise;” Wise in that wisdom from above, Which to the wrath of man replies That “God is love!” XII And he who labours thus may prove, Though some may wonder at his weakness, The power that lurks in simple love, The might of meekness! TO A ROBIN. I Mild melodist! whose artless note, At foggy eve, at chilly morn, From nature's quiet haunts remote, Here seems a harmony forlorn; Fain would I give thee, for thy song, A carol simple as thy own; For thou, sweet bird! awak'st a throng Of thoughts which rise for thee alone. II It is not that thy lay is fraught With music, like the sky-lark's strain, Or nightingale's, so sweetly caught By listening ear, in midnight's reign; Nor has thy note that deeper sound, O which my heart has felt the thrall, When I have heard, from groves profound, The lone wood-pigeon's frequent call. III But these, each one, and all, give vent To song, where song is wont to flow; Thou, thou art sweetly eloquent, With nothing near to wake that glow Of music, in the haunts of men, Which, amid buildings cluster'd round, From time to time arrests my pen, And makes me listen to its sound. IV Oh! hearts that feel, and eyes that see All as it truly is, can find, Ev'n in an object mean as thee, Food for the meditative mind: But thus it is,—we close our hearts, Our ears, our eyes, to things which, view'd With the keen sense that truth imparts, Might fill our souls with gratitude. V And this absurd and frigid pride, By which our nature is disgrac'd, Philosophy has dignified With the proud name of manly taste. It seems a proof of childishness Thy song to love, thy praise to speak, And he who should its power confess Must be the weakest of the weak. VI Well! be it so:—if life have taught To me one truth distinctly clear, 'Tis this, that unto wakeful thought The humblest source of joy is dear. The lowliest object that can wake Our better feelings by its power, The minstrel for his theme may take, In contemplation's musing hour. VII Canst thou not waken such, sweet bird? Yes; while I listen to thy lay, Thought's hidden stream again seems stirr'd By breezes, which were wont to play Over its current's dimpled course, As once it flow'd so sweetly wild, In happy childhood, when its source Was by no worthless weeds defiled. VIII For then thy song to me express'd All I conceiv'd of harmony; And the red plumage of thy breast Was beautiful to childhood's eye. While tales, by infancy held dear, Of funeral rites by thee perform'd, Made, what was music to my ear, A spell that deeper feelings warm'd. IX And since thou now bring'st back again The memory of such hours to me, Shall I, beguil'd by that sweet strain, Blush for this tribute paid to thee? No, never! if on wisdom's plan, (All worldly precepts far above,) “The child be father of the man,” I justly owe thee praise and love. X But not for me, alone, thy song Dost thou at eve and morn awake; On other ears, amid this throng Of buildings, it may sweetly break: Bed-ridden age, perchance, may hear Those soft and simple strains of thine; And scenes, and hours long past, may cheer Its grief, as they have lighten'd mine. XI One more reflection yet remains; Or wise, or foolish, 'twill intrude; I trace in thee, and in thy strains, My own, my song's similitude. Like thee, in scenes adverse to song, I act the minstrel's humble part; Like thine, my numbers, weak or strong, Nor seek, nor own the aid of art. XII And I, methinks, were well content, Like thee, to be by most unheeded, If with my artless strains there went, As with thy own, a charm that pleaded For Nature, Tenderness, and Truth,— Which childhood's innocence possesses, Which beautify e'en blooming youth, And honour age's silver tresses. DEATH. I Since time the awful hour will bring Which must receive our parting breath; 'Tis no unwise, or useless thing To fix our earnest thoughts on Death. II To place before our mental view A crisis — which we cannot shun, When we, in bidding Time adieu, Shall find Eternity begun. III It must an awful summons prove, E'en to the best, — to leave behind All we have found to cheer, to love, In human life, in human kind! IV Then, in the looks of those around, Who never seem'd so dear before, Doubt has a silent answer found, And feels that earthly hope is o'er. V Then, spite of fond affection's thrill, That fain would linger—follow fast The dizzy faintness,—sick'ning chill, Which lead us onward—to the last! VI The filmy eye, with vacant gaze, Views not the things it rests upon; The fluttering pulse more feebly plays, And feeling, hearing, sense—are gone. VII If hands are clasp'd, the heart, unstirr'd By that last pressure, feels no glow; If sobs are indistinctly heard, The ear their meaning does not know. VIII Thus dead unto “the life of life,” All it can give we feel no more, But wait the last unconscious strife,— And soon that struggle, too, is o'er. IX Is this a scene we all must prove In the short lapse of days or years? And round our couch the friends we love Thus pour their unavailing tears? X No — Faith dispels the awful gloom, And bids the mourner's weeping eyes Behold, from yonder bursting tomb, The Sun of Righteousness arise. XI No more on man's expiring hour Impervious clouds of darkness fall; Death has now lost his boasted power, Nor dares the ransom'd victim thrall. XII Why should we fear his transient sway, Since Jesus broke the tyrant's chain? Because He lives, our slumb'ring clay Shall wake to light and life again. XIII Oh, who may hope that awful hour, That righteous Judge in peace to meet? They who on earth confess'd his power, And cast their crowns at Jesus' feet. XIV Weak though they are, by nature frail, Hopes, fix'd on him, their hearts possess; Faith bids them look within the veil, And Christ becomes their righteousness. XV Can I such blissful state attain, Who, long in doubt and darkness bound, Have felt that all my works are vain As tinkling cymbals' empty sound? XVI Yes—for in conscious weakness springs Sincerest trust in Power Divine; Then rest beneath His guardian wings, And hope, and faith, and peace, are thine. XVII No more than this I ask, or need, Secure, since near th' eternal throne He ever lives, and still will plead For all who his dominion own. XVIII On Him then cast each anxious care, To Him thy secret griefs confide; His hand shall point the latent snare, And aid thee when severely tried. XIX And when life's closing hour draws nigh, May no vain fears thy bosom chill, But, though unseen by mortal eye, That heavenly guide be with thee still. XX Oh, be it thus! and visions bright, Blest foretaste of a life divine, Triumphant songs, and crowns of light, The parting soul may well resign. XXI I would not o'er a brighter mind Than I can boast, a shadow fling; Nor would I doubt the bliss they find Whose dying lips can praises sing. XXII But unto me earth's holiest hymn Would float, I fear, unheeded by, When earth itself was growing dim, And ‘things unseen’ were drawing nigh. XXIII Nor, if I now can rightly view What my own feelings then may be, Could aught that man might say, or do, Afford availing strength to me. XXIV The most that I presume to think, Through boundless mercy, may be mine, When plac'd on being's trembling brink, Is humble trust in grace Divine. STOKE HILLS. I It may be lovely, from the height Of Skiddaw's summit, moss'd and grey, To feed the inexhausted sight On the magnificent array Which such a prospect must display: On Keswick's lowly, peaceful vale; On Derwentwater's scatter'd isles; On torrents, bright with morning's smiles, Or mark'd by mist-wreaths pale. II I never gaz'd on such a scene; Yet, if I give my fancy wings, I half could think I there had been, By force of her imaginings; She in such witching beauty brings The landscape to my mental eye; I feel almost as if I stood In its romantic solitude, Beneath a cloudless sky. III But not in the exultant bliss Of such a fascinating hour, Hath scenery sublime as this, Where lakes expand, and mountains tower, Upon my heart so deep a power, Or wakes in it such tender thrills, As when, immers'd in busy thought, And reveries by Memory brought, I stand upon Stoke Hills. IV It is not that the landscape there Can vie with Skiddaw's ampler scope; Nor can Stoke Hills, so soft and fair, With Cumbria's giant mountain cope: What seest thou, standing on their slope, Or loftiest eminence, to fill The eye with rapture, or the mind With transports, that thou might'st not find On many another hill? V Outstretch'd beneath, indeed, may be, In loveliness diversified— A prospect beautiful, which he Who has most frequently descried, Still finds with many a charm supplied, And lingers, as if loath to leave it; Whether it bask in morning's glow, Or evening's shades, succeeding slow, Of softer charms bereave it. VI But a mere town, a pond, a river, And meadows, sprinkled o'er with trees, Whose light leaves in the sunshine quiver, When stirr'd by each low, rustling breeze,— Such objects, though they well may please A heart that unto beauty clings; Yet could not, of themselves, excite Emotions, dearer than delight, The well-known prospect brings. VII O! nothing is more true than this; It is not through the eye alone We gather either bale or bliss, From scenes which it may gaze upon: Their sweetest tint, their deepest tone, That which most saddens or endears, Is shed on them by thoughts and feelings, Which rise, at Memory's still revealings, From dreams of former years! VIII The scenes that met our early gaze, The very turf we trod on then, The trees we climb'd; as fancy strays Back to those long-past hours again, Revive, and re-appear, as when The soul with sorrow kept no strife; But, in its first imaginings, Unfurl'd its own ethereal wings, And sprang to light and life. IX Can ev'n the bright and fairy dreams Of fiction wrought in poesy; Or visions, with which fancy teems, Of love, in love's idolatry, Compare with childhood's memory? No! these, ev'n when most pure their birth, Have something in their loveliest guise, Which, half instinctively, implies They are of lower earth. X But the soul is not:—some, indeed, Have said, that ere on earth it came, (As by a power Divine decreed,) To animate this mortal frame, It pre-existed, still the same; And more will own to man is given A spirit, whose young life within, Ere tamper'd with by conscious sin, Was fed by thoughts from heaven! XI And its first joys, and hopes, and fears, Were such as never more can meet A parallel in after years; Well may their memories be sweet! 'Tis more than earthly bliss to greet Even a silent thought—which brings Some token by its soothing powers, It comes back from those happier hours, With healing on its wings. XII Then wonder not that I prefer Such scene to Skiddaw's prouder height;— It is a still interpreter Of more than meets the outward sight; I look through vistas far more bright, More fair, than outward vision gives; And feel, when plac'd on such a spot, My spirit's present griefs forgot, As in the past it lives! THE GRAVE. I I love to muse, when none are nigh, Where yew-tree branches wave, And hear the winds, with softest sigh, Sweep o'er the grassy grave. II It seems a mournful music, meet To soothe a lonely hour; Sad though it be, it is more sweet Than that from Pleasure's bower. III I know not why it should be sad, Or seem a mournful tone, Unless by man the spot be clad With terrors not its own. IV To nature it seems just as dear As earth's most cheerful scite; The dew-drops glitter there as clear, The sun-beams shine as bright. V The showers descend as softly there, As on the loveliest flowers; Nor does the moonlight seem more fair On Beauty's sweetest bowers. VI “Ay! but within—within there sleeps One, o'er whose mould'ring clay The loathsome earth-worm winds and creeps, And wastes that form away.” VII And what of that? The frame that feeds The reptile tribe below, As little of their banquet heeds, As of the winds that blow. VIII Once more upon my musing strain A voice appears to break:— “But if he sleep to rise again! Should that no awe awake?” IX And yet, perhaps, the voice that now Thus breaks on fancy's ear, When life was thron'd upon that brow, Spake not one word of fear. X But now, when fear and hope are things Which can do nought to save; Each starts to life, and vainly clings Around the silent grave. XI 'Tis strange! we know we live—to die! And die—again to live! Yet, while these truths might good supply, We slight what they would give. XII But, were we wise, our serious thought Beside the spot we fear, Might make it one with blessings fraught, To hallow'd feelings dear. XIII To have it such, we must not view That spot with slavish dread; Nor paint in fancy's darkest hue The chambers of the dead. XIV A grave-yard is a school to teach The living how to live; And has a silent power to preach, Which pulpits cannot give. XV But its most eloquent appeal Is not to fear alone; To hearts that deeply, justly feel, It has a gentler tone. XVI A tone too gentle far to break On ears that hearken not! But known to hearts that inly ache To share that quiet spot. XVII To such it says, “With patience bear Your load of life awhile; With meek submission shun despair, And view me with a smile. XVIII “If friends desert, if foes oppress, But brief their power can be; Look unto Him, whose love can bless, Triumphant over me. XIX “To those by Him redeem'd, my bed Is softer far than down: Here you may rest the aching head, Nor heed each worldly frown. XX “Enfolded in my calm embrace, The heart can heave no sigh; The mournful glance no longer trace ‘Unkindness’ alter'd eye Gray..' XXI “No more upon the wounded ear Reproach or taunt can fall; Nor accents cold, from friends once dear, The keenest pang of all! XXII “No longer tutor'd lips must feign The smile more sad than tears; Here cheeks are pale, but not with pain, Hearts cold, but not with fears. XXIII “To them who die in peace with Heaven, Its gates of pearl I ope; And am, like Achor's Valley, given To be the door of hope!” TO MRS. HEMANS. I Lady! if I for thee would twine The ivy-wreath, can feeling trace No cause why, on a brow like thine, The Muse might fitly place Its verdant foliage—“never sere,” Of glossy, and of changeless hue? Ah! yes, there is a cause most dear To truth, and nature too. II It is not that it long hath been Combin'd with thoughts of festal rite; The cup which thou hast drunk, I ween, Not always sparkled bright! Nor is it that it hath been twined Round victory's brow in days gone by; Such glory has no power to blind Thy intellectual eye. III For thou canst look beyond the hour Elated by the wine-cup's thrall, Beyond the victor's proudest power, Unto the end of all! And therefore would I round thy brow The deathless wreath of ivy place, For well thy song has prov'd, that thou Art worthy of its grace. IV Had earth, and earth's delights alone, Unto thy various strains given birth; Then had I o'er thy temples thrown The fading flowers of earth; And trusting that e'en these, portray'd By thee in song, would spotless be, The jasmine's, lily's, harebell's braid Should brightly bloom for thee. V But thou to more exalted themes Hast nobly urg'd the Muse's claim; And other light before thee beams Than fancy's meteor flame; And from thy harp's entrancing strings Sounds have proceeded, more sublime, Than e'er were waken'd by the things Which appertain to time! VI Yes, lady! Thou hast truly set, Even to the masters of the lyre, An eloquent example!—yet How few have caught thy fire! How few of their most lofty lays Have to religion's cause been given, And taught the kindling soul to raise Its hopes, its thoughts, to heaven! VII Yet this at least has been thy aim; For thou hast chosen that better part, Above the lure of worldly fame, To touch, and teach the heart: To touch it, by no slight appeal To feelings in each heart confest; To teach, by truths that bear the seal God hath himself imprest. VIII And can those flowers, that bloom to fade, For thee a fitting wreath appear? No! Wear thou then the ivy-braid, Whose leaves are never sere! It is not gloomy; brightly play The sun-beams on its glossy green; And softly on it sleeps the ray Of moonlight, all serene. IX It changes not, as seasons flow In changeful, silent course along; Spring finds it verdant, leaves it so; It outlives Summer's song; Autumn no wan, or russet stain Upon its fadeless glory flings: And Winter o'er it sweeps in vain, With tempest on his wings. X “Then wear thou this”—the ivy-crown! And though the bard who twines it be Unworthy of thy just renown, Such wreath is worthy thee. For hers it is who lends her powers To virtue's sacred cause alone; Whose page not only teems with flowers, But may by fruit be known. VERSES ON THE GATEWAY STILL STANDING AT NETTLESTEAD, SUFFOLK. I Thou art noble yet, for thy ruins recal The remembrance of vanish'd glory; And Time, which has levell'd the ancient hall, Still spares thee to tell of its story. II O'er thy crumbling arch the sculptur'd shield, In spite of spoil's bereavement, Is left as a relique, on which are reveal'd The insignia of bold achievement. III When first they were graven, to honour's eye Their emblazonment shone forth brightly; But now the rustic passes them by, And thinks of their legend lightly. IV It boots but little. To rise, and fall, And leave but a wreck to outlive them, Is as it should be, the lot of all Who trust in what pride can give them. V There are thoughts more touching than those which rise From pride's departed splendour; And thine is connected with countless ties, Which waken ideas more tender. VI The heart, with its griefs, joys, hopes, and fears, Changes little in passions and powers; And theirs, who sojourn'd here in distant years, Cherish'd feelings the same as ours! VII For they liv'd, and they lov'd like us; and this Was their home, in pain and pleasure; And the best of them hoarded here their bliss, As the miser his hidden treasure. VIII And now, when the trappings of glory fade, And its sunniest heights are shrouded, The beams of affection, that brighten'd its shade, Are to Memory's eye unclouded. IX To the heart, to the heart, we must turn at last, For all that endures the longest; Its better feelings no blight can blast, For their strength is in storms the strongest. X But in storm, or sunshine, 'tis theirs alone, To leave that enchantment behind them, Which gives them an influence all must own, By Nature herself assign'd them. XI Thou art noble yet, thou desolate pile! For the trophies of fame enwreathe thee; But that fame is not worth one tear, or smile, Of some who have pass'd underneath thee. THE CONTRAST. I I stood, in thought, on Shinar's plain, And saw that tower arise, Whose height so vast, by builders vain, Was meant to reach the skies: It seem'd to stand before my sight, Like phantoms which, in dreams of night, We see with wond'ring eyes; Distrusted, when they meet our view, But gazed at, till we think them true. II I will not say that thought could cheat My judgment so to deem Of this ideal counterfeit; Nor was it slumber's dream: But in imagination's hour The past, by her creative power, May like the present seem; And make us for the time compeers Of them who lived in distant years. III And thus I thought before me stood That tower of early fame, Rear'd by the erring multitude To make themselves a name: Of lofty height and ample base, Though boasting little finished grace, Seem'd its gigantic frame; Surpassing, in its wondrous size, All Egypt's later prodigies. IV It rose, until its massy form Far length'ning shadows cast; Bidding defiance to the storm, And smiling at the blast: And even to Euphrates' wave Its lofty summit lustre gave, The loveliest, and the last, Which, borrow'd from the sun's last gleam, It shed upon that distant stream. V And Shinar's plain was throng'd around With earth's primeval race, Who all alike intent were found, Each lab'ring in his place, To rear the tower, whose deathless fame Should be their own enduring name, Their city's chiefest grace: For to one common home they clung, And spoke but in one common tongue. VI But God came down to see the tower, And city they had made; And by his overwhelming power Their policy gainsay'd; Giving to each a tongue unknown, Their plans and counsels were o'erthrown, His sovereignty display'd; And what they eagerly had sought To shun, their own presumption wrought. VII O then, in that discordant crowd, What wild confusion rose! As each, in accents fierce and loud, Attempted to disclose The aid he proffer'd, help he sought; Till they who were together brought As friends, were turn'd to foes; Desirous but apart to roam, And seek a widely sever'd home! VIII The vision pass'd! crowd, tower, and plain Fleeted in thought away: Imagination's power again Resum'd her dream-like sway; And as her magic spell prevail'd, I stood amid the throng who hail'd The church's earlier day; Nor greater contrast could be known Than was by such transition shown. IX Around me were the gathered host Who came to seek their Lord; Owning, that solemn Pentecost, One place with one accord: And, for the time, I seem'd to stand Spectator of that Christian band, By Gentile tribes abhorr'd, Chosen to publish, far and wide, The Gospel of the Crucified! X When, on a sudden, came a sound, As of a wind from heaven, Which sweeps o'er ocean's depths profound, Or is through forests driven! And on each head, in rev'rence bar'd, Bright cloven tongues of fire declar'd The gift which God had given: The power, in tongues unknown till then, To make salvation known to men. XI Well might that miracle then plead With hearts untouch'd before; As Parthian, Elamite, and Mede, Crete, Arab, Roman, Moor,— Each in his native tongue address'd With deep surprise and awe confess'd That every doubt was o'er; And eagerly preferr'd his claim To be baptiz'd in Jesus' name. XII This vision also pass'd away; Yet did it first disclose How diff'rent is the scope and sway Of boons that God bestows. The varying tongues which, heretofore, On Shinar's plain, with loud uproar, Converted friends to foes, Here seem'd like manna to descend, And made a foe far more than friend! XIII Thus talents, gifts, and graces prove Of present good, or ill, As given by God in wrath, or love, To work his gracious will: Man cannot claim them as his own; They come from God, and best are known His purpose to fulfil, When the Receiver's humble aim Would glorify the Giver's name! STANZAS. I It is sweet to give birth to the harp's flowing numbers, When the heart of the minstrel beats high to their sound; It were madness to waken its strings from their slumbers, When the shadows of darkness encompass him round. II There are feelings which cannot by words be imparted, And moods of the mind where expression is pain; When despondency sinks down the desolate-hearted, And even the Muses' high mandates are vain. III Such clouds are around me, sweet Fancy enthralling, Creating dark visions where bright ones should dwell; Every whisper of Hope into silence appalling Is hush'd by their baneful and fear-breathing spell. IV The butterfly, flitting from jasmines to roses, May be welcom'd wherever he folds his soft wings; Let him light where he will, while on sweets he reposes, Of the odours he came from, some vestige he brings. V While the reptile that creeps over Spring's fairest blossom, When its beauty and fragrance are both in their prime, But poisons the perfume he finds in its bosom, And mars all its glory by traces of slime. VI Thus it fares with the bard who delighted to hover, In the spring of the soul, o'er the Eden of mind, And but seem'd to descend on its sweets to discover, Or dispense by alighting, some pleasure refin'd. VII When that Eden, once cloudless, is darkly o'ershaded, Or seems so to him (bitter fruit of our fall): No longer with beauty its flow'rets are braided, “But the trail of the serpent is over them all.” VIII Then vain is the glory of noon's brightest splendour, The stillness of evening, morn's rapturous hymn; The lustre of moonlight no longer seems tender; And a star-sprinkled sky to his vision is dim. IX Existence itself, then, in his estimation, Appears but a blank, where enjoyment is not; And the words of the monarch, that “All is vexation,” The legend inscrib'd on mortality's lot. X Can he, then, give birth to the harp's flowing numbers, When his soul can no longer rejoice in their strain? It were weakness to waken its visionless slumbers, When the memory, alone, of its music is pain! XI No, no; let him hang on some yew-tree, all blasted, The pride of past moments, to which he still clings; Be its mouldering frame by the midnight winds wasted, And ivy and aconite twine round its strings. XII Even then, by the hand of its master forsaken, It may prove that its music was truly its own, As the winds sweeping by it may fitfully waken Its echo-like dirge, with their tenderest tone. THE RECANTATION; TO ? ?. I I will not yield to gloom! since thou, With Friendship's soothing tone, Turn'st kindly tow'rd me, even now, 'Mid sorrows of thine own: Magnanimously kind to one Whom lighter hearts might coldly shun. II My thanks, thy praise, should I express, Such might but give thee pain; Thy worth, thy gentle tenderness, Require no votive strain; Nor is thy own that petty pride Which is by plaudits gratified. III If brighter days should ever be My brief allotment here, Unless their brightness reach'd to thee, To me they must be drear: Since thou, in grief, hast thought of mine, Could I be blest if grief were thine? IV No, never! and if hours more bright On earth I may not know; I will not think it starless night, While yet around me glow Those twilight gleams of softest dye, Which looks, words, deeds of thine supply. V O! none can feel, but wounded hearts, Which only throb to ache, What genuine sympathy imparts, What feelings it can wake: That such within my bosom dwell, I owe to thee. Farewell! Farewell! VERSES TO A CHILD TWO YEARS OLD. I Could I, sweet child, invoke for thee A blessing of transcendent worth; Such might'st thou justly claim from me, And this dark day might give it birth. II Thine it should be, because I owe To thee, at times, the blest recal Of being's earlier, brighter glow, And nature's tend'rest, sweetest thrall. III For who could look upon thy face, Whether in smiles, or tears array'd, Nor feel the soft, resistless grace By early innocence display'd? IV O! many a time its soothing power Has charm'd me from myself awhile; And shed on sorrow's sunless hour Something like joy's remember'd smile. V Nor least delightful is its sway Now, when the winds that sweep around, On dark December's shortest day The closing year's deep dirge resound. VI In such a season, smiles like thine Around them more of brightness fling, Than outward sunbeams, when they shine Upon the sweetest flowers of Spring. VII They flow from feelings far above What Spring's gay beauties can impart; They speak of tenderness and love, Warm from a glowing, guileless heart. VIII What are, to thee, the noise and strife Of this world's tumult?—Things unknown! Love is thy polar star of life, Thou livest now to love alone. IX In those around, who hold thee dear, Thy smiles reflected pleasure wake; Thy love imparts that power to cheer, And theirs are sweet for love's dear sake. X And most of all to her fond heart, Who views thee with as fond an eye, Each transport thou canst there impart, Or share, love only can supply. XI 'Tis this that makes thy smiles and tears Call forth her deepest tenderness; 'Tis this that unto thee endears Her silent glance, her soft caress. XII Long, long may such appear to thee The light of life's intelligence; And may thy true affection be In future years their recompense! DAYS OF DARKNESS. “But if a man live many years, and rejoice in them all, yet let him remember the days of darkness, for they shall be many.” Ecclesiastes, xi. 8. I I have not yet lived many years, Nor have those years been calmly bright; For many cares, and griefs, and fears, Have darkly veil'd their light: Yet, even now, at times I deem, To contemplation's pensive eye, Symptoms exist, by which 'twould seem That darker days draw nigh. II The early flush of sanguine hope, Which once, elate in confidence, With disappointment well could cope, And wrestle with suspense; The vivid warmth of fancy's glow, Which by its own creative powers Could body forth, on earth below, The forms of brighter bowers: III The young imaginings of thought, Freshness of feeling,—all that made Existence with enchantment fraught, At times seem wrapt in shade: And moods of mind will come unbid, When dark and darker grows the gloom, Within whose depths obscure, half hid, Appears the opening tomb! IV I will not say that all is night; For reason's pallid lamp,—the ray Of revelation's glorious light, At seasons let in day; And by its beams, in mercy given, That soul-enthralling, fearful gloom Unfolds, when thus asunder riven, A vista through the tomb. V But O! within, above, around, Enough is darkly overcast, From which this painful truth is found— Life's brightest days are past: And many a mournful sign appeals Unto my musing spirit's eye, Which, to my pensive thought, reveals That darker days are nigh. VI And let them come!—Shall man receive, In this probationary state, Good from his God, yet weakly grieve When He, as wise as great, Sees right, with merciful design, To send that salutary ill, Which, meekly borne, through love benign, Effects his gracious will? VII The cloudless glory of morn's sky, Which ushers in a beauteous day, What time the viewless lark, on high, Chaunts forth his cheerful lay, Is beautiful; but clouds, and showers, And mists, although they may appear Less lovely than those sun-bright hours, To Nature are as dear. VIII The lavish luxury of Spring, When flowers are bursting into bloom, And tints upon an insect's wing Out-rival Ormus' loom; The Summer's radiance;—Autumn's sway Of matron majesty and grace; Enchant in turn, then pass away, And give stern Winter place. IX Thus is it with the outward frame Of wondrous Nature; changing still, And yet unchangeably the same — Obedient to his will, Alike in every season shown, As each proclaims its author's praise; Nor is this silent in the tone Of Winter's stormiest days. X No; in the voice of mighty winds, At intervals to stillness aw'd, Has it not seem'd, to thoughtful minds, A spirit was abroad? And thus the same Eternal Power, Though viewless unto mortal eye, When skies are bright, when tempests lower Is still for ever nigh! XI Is there no lesson taught to man By that which unto outward sense, Through vast creation's matchless plan, Proclaims benevolence? Shall man distrust his goodness, who, Spring after spring, with vital breath, Revives the universe anew, Educing life from death? XII Say not within thy inmost soul, When mental darkness veils its light, And clouds, more dense than winter's, roll Before the spirit's sight; Say not that light will ne'er return; That thou art of thy God forgot; His lamp, within, may feebly burn, Though thou discern'st it not. XIII To journey on from day to day, Yet scarcely catch one trembling gleam Of that more glorious sun, whose ray Within, was joy supreme; To feel the more than wintry chill That orb's eclipse must ever bring, Is but thy portion to fulfil Of human suffering. XIV 'Tis no peculiar lot of thine, Thy sole, irrevocable doom; Others have seen that splendour shine, And seem to set in gloom: The pang its absence now imparts, Though painful it may be to bear, Has been endur'd by aching hearts, Endur'd without despair. XV But not in human strength alone! The strength of man is weakness here; His wisdom, follishness is shown In trials so severe: The outward ills, which all must feel, Man's spirit may perhaps control; God only can illume and heal The darken'd, wounded soul. XVI His mercy never yet assign'd (Can we conceive it could be so?) To any one of human-kind The cup of hopeless woe. Life's goblet may, to some, be brimm'd With more than wormwood's bitterness; Much of its day by clouds be dimm'd;— Yet all design'd to bless. XVII There is a sorrow—better far Than noisy mirth which spurns control; For Folly's raptures often mar The flow of Pleasure's bowl:— There is a sadness of the face, By which the heart is better made; A brook to bless the desert place, A gourd to cast its shade. XVIII That brook, that gourd, are theirs alone, Who meekly place their hopes on Him, Before whose glory-circled throne The stars of heaven are dim! Then trust in God! his name thy tower! Who by his own resistless might, Can overcloud Life's brightest hour,— Make days of darkness—light! THE POOL OF BETHESDA. I Around Bethesda's healing wave, Waiting to hear the rustling wing Which spoke the Angel nigh, who gave Its virtue to that holy spring, With patience, and with hope endued, Were seen the gather'd multitude. II Among them there was one, whose eye Had often seen the waters stirr'd; Whose heart had often heav'd the sigh, The bitter sigh, of hope deferr'd; Beholding, while he suffer'd on, The healing virtue given and gone! III No power had he; no friendly aid To him its timely succour brought! But while his coming he delay'd, Another won the boon he sought; Until The Saviour's love was shown, Which heal'd him by a word alone! IV Had they who watch'd and waited there Been conscious who was passing by, With what unceasing, anxious care Would they have sought his pitying eye; And crav'd, with fervency of soul, His Power Divine to make them whole! V But habit and tradition sway'd Their minds to trust to sense alone; They only hoped the Angel's aid; While in their presence stood, unknown, A greater, mightier far than he, With power from every pain to free. VI Bethesda's pool has lost its power! No Angel, by his glad descent, Dispenses that diviner dower Which with its healing waters went. But He, whose word surpassed its wave, Is still omnipotent to save. VII And what that fountain once was found, Religion's outward forms remain— With living virtue only crown'd While their first freshness they retain; Only replete with power to cure When, Spirit-stirr'd, their source is pure! VIII Yet are there who this truth confess, Who know how little forms avail; But whose protracted helplessness Confirms the impotent's sad tale; Who, day by day, and year by year, As emblems of his lot appear. IX They hear the sounds of life and love, Which tell the visitant is night; They see the troubled waters move, Whose touch alone might health supply; But, weak of faith, infirm of will, Are powerless, helpless, hopeless still! X Saviour! thy love is still the same As when that healing word was spoke; Still in thine all-redeeming name Dwells power to burst the strongest yoke! O! be that power, that love display'd, Help those—whom Thou alone canst aid! TO THE MEMORY OF EMMA FULLER. “Full many a gem of purest ray serene The dark, unfathom'd caves of ocean bear; Full many a flower is born to blush unseen, And waste its sweetness on the desert air.” Gray's Elegy. I Yes; flowrets unseen their rich perfume may shed, And bright gems be hidden in ocean's dark bed; But more touchingly tender than either, to me, Is the life and the death of a being like thee. II Thy brief span of life, like a vision, is fled, And thine is the peaceful repose of the dead; For the slumber of those who in innocence die, Can scarcely an image of anguish supply. III It is true that the blight of a flowret in May, Ere its beautiful blossom the eye can repay, Awakens some feelings approaching to grief, Which haunt not the slow fall of Autumn's sere leaf. IV And yet, if we calmly reflect on thy lot, It seems like a bright page which sorrow would blot; And he who would sully that page with a tear, Is blind to its beauty, so spotless and clear. V For me, I could envy thee! thus in the bloom Of the heart and the soul to go down to the tomb; While the first knew not anguish, and sin had not cast Those clouds which more darkly o'ershadow the last. VI Hadst thou died in thy childhood, I scarcely can tell If thy death had been fraught with so potent a spell; For, with much of its purity, now are combin'd Reflections with far deeper feelings entwin'd. VII Thou hadst liv'd long enough to acknowledge the sway Of the softest of passions our hearts can obey; The purest—in bosoms where innocence keeps Its watch o'er the heart, like a star o'er the deeps. VIII Thou didst love, and wert lov'd; and the future was bright, At times, with the hues of imagin'd delight; But thou didst not, when call'd on such hopes to resign, At the will of Omnipotence, vainly repine. IX Unto Him, who can humble the lofty and pround, With gentle submission thy meek spirit bow'd; And the merciful love of thy Lord and thy King Robb'd the grave of its victory, and death of its sting. X Thus wert thou enabled, when dying, to bless The name of thy God, and his goodness confess; And thy spirit, prepar'd for its joyous release, Pure, gentle, and pious, departed in peace! XI Although, in thy life-time, thou wast unto me But as one of Earth's daughters, delightful to see; A form which, in passing, attracts by its grace, And features, whose mildness 'tis soothing to trace; XII Yet when thou wast dead, while remembrance still dwelt On the image its mirror reflected,—I felt A desire, which I could not and cannot explain, Gentle girl! to behold those mild features again! XIII They were chang'd! O! how much, since I look'd on them last! From the cheek, wan and wasted, its faint bloom had pass'd; O'er the sunk eye, all lustreless, darkness had roll'd; And the lips, pale and bloodless, as marble were cold! XIV But, contemplating these, in defiance of all Death had done to disfigure, disease to appal, I thought, as I gaz'd on the charms that remain'd, How imperfect the triumph which both had obtain'd! XV For O! there was meekness and loveliness yet, Like the west's mild effulgence, when day's orb has set; And we know from the twilight, so soft and serene, How calm, and how cloudless his setting has been. XVI On thy features still dwelt, what life cannot disclose, An expression more touching than that of repose; Which silently spoke, unto hearts that could feel, What the tongue of the living can never reveal. XVII “Peace! Peace!” it proclaim'd, or it seem'd so to me, “To an innocent spirit, thus early set free; Unto which, in compassionate goodness, are given The bless'd and enduring enjoyments of heaven!” XVIII Farewell, then, sweet girl! who hast thus, in the bloom Of the heart and the soul, met mortality's doom; And long may I cherish the feeling and thought Which the last sight of thee o'er my hush'd spirit brought. EARLY RISING AND PRAYER. MODERNIZED FROM VAUGHAN'S SILEX SCINTILLANS. I When first thy opening eyes receive The glorious light of day, Give thy awakening spirit leave To be as blest as they. II Our outward organs well may teach Its duty to the soul; And thoughts ascend, that need not speech, Unto their heavenly goal. III For hearts, whose love to God is true, Should open with the day: As flowers impearl'd with morning dew Their tenderest tints display. IV Give God thy waking thoughts, that He, Throughout the day, may keep Thy spirit company, and be Its guardian while asleep. V Yet sleep not when the sun has risen, For prayer with day should rise; And holiest thoughts, set free from prison, Should soar above the skies. VI There are appointed hours between Our souls and love divine; Nothing of earth should intervene To mar their blest design. VII The manna's heavenly charm was gone With morning's stainless dews; And flowers on which the sun has shone Their sweetest perfume lose! VIII Then let not needless slumber glut Morn's glories by its sin: When this world's gates are closest shut, Heaven's open:—enter in! IX Walk out beneath the roseate skies, Eye, ear, and heart awake; List to the melodies that rise From tree, from bush, and brake. X Each fluttering leaf, each murmuring spring, The great I AM doth own; To Him the soaring sky-larks sing In music's sweetest tone. XI Canst thou not sing? O! leave thy cares And follies; go thy way! And morning's praises, morning's prayers, Go with thee through the day! XII Serve God before the world below; Nor suffer, unimplor'd, That blessing from thy path to go, He only can afford. XIII This done, to him resign thy will, Who never will forsake Those who, like Jacob, wrestle still, As day begins to break. XIV Weep for thy sins,—to Him apply Who can those sins forgive; But know that self and pride must die Before thy soul can live. XV Mornings are emblems, shadowing forth, Unto the spirit's eye, Man's resurrection, and the birth Of hopes that cannot die. XVI The glorious star which speaks them near, Like that of Bethlehem, Is life, and light!—its rise more dear Than crown or diadem. XVII But when the morning's prime is past, And worldly cares are rife, May thy soul's harmony outlast The daily din of life! XVIII Keep well thy temper;—mingle not With aught that thou shalt find, Which may its lingering brightness blot, Or chase it from thy mind. XIX Despatch whatever must be done; Life hath a load to bear, Which may be borne; a path to run, Beset with many a care. XX Keep such without; and let thy heart Be still thy God's alone; And He, thy spirit's better part, Shall bless thee as his own! THE TWELVE MONTHS OF HUMAN LIFE. I Twelve months compose each fleeting year; And, unto those who rightly scan, Twelve brief compartments may appear Compris'd in life's accustom'd span: Nor need it be a waste of time To trace this parallel in rhyme. II The first six years of human life Like the year's opening month are found; Commenc'd in being's natal strife, With little obvious produce crown'd; For when six years their course have run, Existence scarcely is begun. III 'Twas thus, we find, in Mirzah's dream, That bridge which human life portray'd Was veil'd from sight at each extreme As by impenetrable shade; And only what the Genius told Could its beginning—end, unfold. IV The next six years of life lead on To boyhood's hopes, and boyhood's fears: And February, ere 'tis gone, An emblem of this age appears: No fruit we find, no lasting flowers, But mind begins to feel its powers. V As outward nature now prepares For finite man the face of earth, And length'ning day to sight declares The laughing Spring's approaching birth; So does the glance of boyhood's eye Betoken youth is drawing nigh. VI March follows next; the voice of song Is heard, and gardens brightly bloom; Though stormy winds may sweep along, Their sound inspires no moody gloom; Though clouds, at times, perchance may lower, We look beyond the present hour! VII And thus does youth, with eye elate, At blithe eighteen existence view; Nor stormy winds, nor clouds abate The wild bird's music, flow'ret's hue: Life is to him a waking vision, And earth a paradise Elysian. VIII Now April lavishly unfolds The violet's bloom, the chesnut's flowers; And, amid weeping clouds, beholds, With smiling eye, her verdant bowers; And, ere she bids those bowers “farewell!” Woos Love to bless them with his spell. IX Now too the youth to manhood grown, From fond eighteen to twenty-four, Thinks time mis-spent, if spent alone, Or flies to solitude the more, As ardent and romantic love A source of pain or bliss may prove. X Then May comes on! delightful May! Dispensing, ere she bid adieu, More genial airs, and skies more gay, Than waken'd April's changeful hue: The days have nearly reach'd their length, And beauty its more lusty strength. XI Man too, at thirty, may be found, For intellectual powers at least, In his best prime, with vigour crown'd, His earlier ardours scarce decreas'd, Although he may not now enjoy Much that gave pleasure to the boy. XII In June some earlier fruits have caught Their ripen'd glory from the sun; And other joys to sense are brought Than can from sight alone be won; Beauty with usefulness combines, And from such union brighter shines. XIII And thus, when man is thirty-six, Some ripening fruits of sager reason Should with life's lingering blossoms mix, To dignify that prouder season; Nor should we then, in friendship, choose The man who only could amuse! XIV The sultry noontide of July Next bids us seek the forest's shade; Or for the crystal streamlet sigh, That flows in some sequester'd glade: Sated with sunshine and with flowers, We learn that life has languid hours. XV And he who lives to forty-two, Nor has this needful truth been taught, That calm retirement must renew, From time to time, the springs of thought, Or who would such renewal shun, Is, by his folly, half undone! XVI 'Tis not enough to say, “We know, As yet, no chilling, wintry blight;” For noontide's fierce, unshaded glow May wither, when it beams most bright; He that hopes evening's tranquil smile, Must in his zenith pause awhile! XVII The husbandmen in August reap The produce of their labours past; Or, if the ling'ring season keep Their recompense delay'd, will cast A frequent glance around, and try To guess what harvest may supply. XVIII Thus too should man, at forty-eight, Turn inward to a harvest there; His mental crops should calculate, And for their gath'ring-in prepare; 'Tis prudent to look round, and see What such a harvest-home may be! XIX September's morn and eve are chill, Reminding us that time rolls on; And Winter, though delaying still His wither'd features, wo-begone, On day's decreasing length encroaching, Gives token of his sure approaching. XX And let not man at fifty-four, Though, like September's noon, he may, At times, be cloudless as of yore, O'erlook its dawning, closing day; But by the length'ning nights be taught Increasing seriousness of thought! XXI The sere leaf, flitting on the blast, The hips and haws in every hedge, Bespeak October come! At last We stand on Winter's crumbling edge; Like Nature's opening grave, we eye The two brief months not yet gone by. XXII And he who has attain'd three-score, Should bear in mind that sere old age Must, in a few years, less or more, Conclude his mortal pilgrimage; And seek to stand aloof from all That meditation might enthral. XXIII November's clouds are gathering round, Dispensing darker, deeper gloom; And Nature, as with awe profound, Waits her irrevocable doom; Watching the pale sun's fitful gleam Through the dense fogs that veil his beam. XXIV And thus, in human life's November, When sixty years and six are by, 'Tis time that man should oft remember “The hour approaches he must die!” True, he may linger to four-score, But death is waiting at the door! XXV December closes on the scene; And what appear the months gone past? Fragments of time, which once have been! Succeeding slowly, fled too fast! Their minutes, hours, and days appear Viewless in that small point, a year! XXVI The man, too, with the year has fled, Three-score and twelve pronounc'd his doom; As nature's beauties now seem dead, His relics rest within the tomb; Yet both a future life shall see; His—prove an Immortality! TO A DILATORY CORRESPONDENT. I Much as thy silence I admire, Yet taciturnity may tire, By its protracted tedium; And make one wish, in words, to find, For intercourse 'twixt mind and mind, A more congenial medium. II I ne'er profess'd, with learned ease, To understand dead languages; And, to my cogitation, That language is most truly dead, Which, leaving every thing unsaid, Conveys no information. III Silence is eloquent, I own, While looks can make its meaning known In tête-à-tête communion; But paper, pen, and ink possess No power, a single thought t' express, Without a triple union. IV He who has not within his reach These requisites for distant speech, May be excused for balking; But he who has them close at hand Deserves a friendly reprimand, Unless he set them talking! LOWESTOFT. I Once only, and long past the hour, In pensive thought awhile I stood On thy steep cliff, whose beacon-tower Boldly o'erlooks the briny flood. II It was a calm and lovely eve; The western sky still faintly wore The hue which sunset's glories leave, When their bright source is seen no more. III But o'er the hush'd and slumb'ring deep The mists of evening flung their screen; Though still glanc'd forth, upon thy steep, Its white alcoves, and foliage green. IV Thy lofty beacon's dazzling light Shot forth its guiding beams afar, To bless the home-bound seaman's sight, Who hail'd it as his polar star. V Yet though no lovelier, calmer hour Could meet the poet's thoughtful eye, He had but half confess'd its power, Unless some kindred soul were nigh. VI But he who stood beside me there, To view the tower, the cliff, the main, Not only could the present share; He felt the past revive again. VII Yes; thou, my lost, lamented friend! Living belov'd, and dead rever'd, To such a scene and hour couldst lend The mental charm which both endear'd. VIII Thou hadst from youth to manhood been A wand'rer o'er the boundless sea; Its features, stormy or serene, Recall'd departed hours to thee. IX And though revolving years had sped, Since last was brav'd its billowy foam, Yet thou the beetling cliff wouldst tread, Like one who there was most at home. X Now Memory paints thy thoughtful pause, Each look, each word I yet retain, All, all express'd what ample cause Thou hadst to know this spot again. XI It was thy earliest anchoring-place, In thy first voyage o'er the deep; Thy active mind could here retrace Feelings and thoughts long lull'd to sleep. XII For then thy boyish dreams were not To their new element subdued; And home-sick thoughts, friends unforgot, At times would pensively intrude. XIII When anchor'd off this lovely shore, Past every danger, every fear; Land never look'd so sweet before, Home never felt so truly dear. XIV Peace to thy memory! Scenes less fair, If visited with one like thee, Fond recollections oft would share, And present to my fancy be. XV But Lowestoft's beacon-crested steep, Its hanging gardens, smiling yet, When silv'ry mist-wreaths veil the deep, Are far too lovely to forget. XVI Hadst thou not shar'd the bliss they gave, They must have been admired by one Who looks on ocean's foamy wave, Earth's shrubby slopes, as I have done. XVII Now they are more; for Memory's spell Has so connected them with thee, That, while upon their charms I dwell, Thou seem'st to live again for me! TO A FRIEND, ON HIS DEPARTURE FOR ROME. I Yes, go! and on those ruins gaze, Whose silent, eloquent appeal To meditation's eye displays What spirits ton'd like thine can feel: Go! stand by Tiber's yellow stream, Mid crumbling columns, domes, and towers: Behold past glory's ling'ring gleam, And find a still exhaustless theme For thought's sublimest powers. II Ascend the lofty Palatine! Gaze from its piny summits round: And oh! what feelings will be thine When treading that immortal ground: Each sculptur'd vase, each speaking bust, Shrine, temple, palace, tomb, and fane, Will plead to thee their earlier trust; To genius, greatness, goodness just, Nor will they plead in vain. III For thou hast held communion long With minds that stamp'd the Augustan age: With Maro's but once-rivall'd song; And, matchless still, the Sabine page: And thou o'er many a name hast por'd That faithful time has ne'er forgot; As men admir'd, as gods ador'd; And in thy inmost heart deplor'd The “Eternal City's” lot. IV Oh! I could envy thee the gush Of feeling, and of thought sublime, When thou, beneath morn's orient blush, Or stillest hour of eve, shalt climb O'er ivied ruins once august, And now in splendid fragments hurl'd: Their haunts, who, sepulchred in dust, Unknown except by urn or bust, Once sway'd a subject world. V “And this”—(Oh friend! I hear thee say, As gazing round with proud delight, Where reliques glorious in decay Shall burst on thy enraptur'd sight)— “And this was Rome! and where I tread “The great, the wise have trod of yore: “Whose names through every clime are spread; “Whose minds the world itself have fed “From their exhaustless store. VI “Whose deeds are told by Hist'ry's pen, “Whose works in sculpture, colour, song, “Still rise magnificent, as when “Here liv'd and mov'd the exalted throng “Of painters, sculptors, bards, whose fame “With time successfully has striven: “Till he, who would their worth proclaim, “Shall find the beam that gilds his name “Is from their glory given.” VII I feel,—I own thy language just; And yet a Briton, standing there, If mindful of the sacred trust Committed now to Albion's care, E'en while he granted—gave to Rome All Rome's just glory could demand; With feelings worthy of his home Encircled by free Ocean's foam, Must love his native land! VIII When Art arrays her magic strife In hues from young Aurora thrown: In wakening forth to all but life Each breathless form of Parian stone: And e'en in song, whose source and aim Demanded but an earthly lyre, Unfed by heaven's ethereal flame; I grant to Rome, all Rome can claim, Or genius can admire. IX Yet I, in British freedom, say, That Albion even now has won A fame less subject to decay, Than grac'd proud Rome's meridian sun: And, in that freedom, she contains Of soul, sublimer, loftier powers; Than e'er enrich'd the Latian plains, When monarchs clash'd their captive chains Beneath her conquering towers. X And, were I what thou art, I should, E'en on the Palatine's proud height, Or stretch'd by Tiber's golden flood, Or where Soracte gleams in sight, Still turn from Rome's majestic ground, To Benhall's sweet sequester'd dome, Her sylvan glades with beauty crown'd; And own, that there my heart had found Its fondly cherish'd home. THE WALL-FLOWER. I The rose is beautiful to view, Begemm'd with dew-drops bright, Which only make its glowing hue More lovely to the sight. II The lily, whose meek beauties seem As if they must be sought; Suggests, like some delightful dream, A train of tender thought. III The violet, which, itself unseen, Sheds sweetest perfume round, Has many a grace for bard to glean, When he its haunt has found. IV All these are beautiful; but one Can match my favourite flower; Nor is there, to my fancy, one That has such soothing power. V Not for its transient beauty's sake, This fades, as others may; But thoughts it has the power to wake Can never pass away. VI To me it speaks of loveliness That passes not with youth; Of beauty which decay can bless, Of constancy and truth. VII Not in prosperity's bright morn, Its streaks of golden light Are lent her splendours to adorn, And make them still more bright: VIII But in adversity's dark hour, When glory is gone by; It then exerts its gentle power The scene to beautify. IX Yes; lovely flower! and thou shalt be My minstrel theme for this; Thy birth-place has a charm for me, Beyond the bowers of bliss. X To me thy scite disconsolate, On turret, wall, or tower, Makes thee appear misfortune's mate, And desolation's dower. XI Thou ask'st no kindly cultur'd soil Thy natal bed to be; Thou need'st not man's officious toil To plant, or water thee. XII Sown by the winds, thou meekly rear'st, On ruin's crumbling crest, Thy fragile form; and there appear'st, In smiling beauty drest. XIII There, in thy bleak and earthless bed, Thou brav'st the tempest's strife; And giv'st, what else were cold and dead, A lingering glow of life. XIV There is a scene where, years ago, I've mark'd thee blooming fair; But then I had not learnt to know What now thou wouldst declare. XV For then I could not feel the force Of loveliness like thine; Nor couldst thou be in youth the source Of thoughts which now are mine. XVI But, even then, to youth's warm gaze Thy blossoming was sweet, What time the bright sun's early rays Illum'd thy lofty seat. XVII And while the breeze and sun-beam dried The night-dew's crystal tear, Thy beauty thoughts of bliss supplied, And hope—that knew not fear. XVIII It seem'd to fancy's vivid dream, That thus love's youthful smile Through sorrow's morning mists should gleam, And every care beguile. XIX But now 'tis sweeter to behold, Upon a lowering eve, Thy wind-swept blossom, meekly bold, The sun's last look receive. XX I love thy beauty then to mark, Thy lingering light to see, When all is growing drear and dark, Except the west, and thee. XXI For then, with brightness caught from heaven, An emblem true thou art Of love's enduring lustre, given To cheer a lonely heart: XXII Of love, whose deepest, tend'rest worth, Till tried, was all unknown; Which owes to sympathy its birth, And “seeketh not its own!” XXIII But, by its self-abandonment, When cares and griefs appal, Appears as if from heaven 'twere sent To compensate for all. XXIV Yet deeper, holier, more divine That emblem to the eye, Could we but trace in it the sign Of pardon from on high. XXV Could we but think that, even thus, Like day's last smile to thee, The Sun of Righteousness, to us, In life's decline might be! XXVI A pledge that hope had not withdrawn, That heavenly love, and light, With everlasting day should dawn On death's approaching night! ON THE DEATH OF A FRIEND. I Mary! I have no tears to give; And what if such could flow from me, Fast might they flow for some who live, And not for those who die like thee. II Yet long-past days, together spent, Endear'd by pleasures, priz'd, how much! Demand this humble monument To thee, who partly mad'st them such. III We met; thyself in youth's fair bloom, And I in blighted manhood: thou, With scarce a thought allied to gloom,— Myself with much to cloud my brow. IV And this I owe thee for the gleams Of joy, then scatter'd o'er my way; Which like the rainbow's lustrous beams, Look'd bright in Sorrow's stormiest day. V Years have rolled by:—and now I hear, With all the past reviv'd anew, That thou, whose friendship thus could cheer, Hast pass'd Death's shadowy valley through. VI I shed no tears for thee:—for tears, If I could give thee such, were vain; But years may pass,—ay! many years,— Ere I shall meet thy like again. VII And thoughts, which find imperfect vent In words, while I the past recal, Raise thee this simple monument, Our Friendship's last memorial! A CHRISTMAS CAROL. I Jesu Hominum Salvator! Thou who cam'st on earth below, Taking on thee mortal nature, Life immortal to bestow:— II Thou, who diedst for man's transgression, Thou, who reignest now above; Still art heard in intercession, Still art known by acts of love! III Fain would I, with rev'rent feeling, Owe my hopes to Thee alone; To thy Sacrifice appealing, Cast each crown before thy Throne. IV Trusting human strength no longer, Henceforth be that weakness mine, Which attempts not to be stronger In itself—but power divine! V Which seeks not—from depths of science,— Heights of knowledge—aid to draw; But in humble, meek reliance On thy Love, would keep thy Law. VI Not from superstitious reasons Would I greet this day with song; In my view all times and seasons Unto Thee alike belong. VII Who to God this day observeth, Keeps it unto God alone! He who from its ritual swerveth, Still may make its good his own. VIII Outward rites, of man's appointing, Can no inward feeling give; 'Tis Thy Spirit's blest anointing Bids the soul awake, and live! IX This alone, by Thee imparted, Can possess resistless power; Can preserve the simple-hearted, In temptation's darkest hour. X Not in subtle speculation, Not in codes, or creeds of man, Not in learned disputation On thy Gospel's hidden plan:— XI Not in reason's proud researches, Fixing thesis, date, or term; Not in quoting synods, churches, Dwells Religion's vital germ. XII This is found in spirits tender'd; Hopes that raise our souls above; Passions chasten'd; wills surrender'd To thy law of perfect love! XIII Time, like some impetuous river To the ocean hast'ning on, Bears us onward to its Giver; Soon will be for ever gone! XIV Let it travel swiftly—slowly, Tow'rds a vast Eternity; Every day of it were holy, If it turn'd our hearts to Thee. XV This, unto my own appealing, Prompts one tribute to Thy Name; Warm with many a mingled feeling, Hope, and fear, and joy, and shame. XVI Since to thee, in love, or terror, Knees must bend, and tongues confess; Cleanse my heart from sin and error, With thy Holy Spirit bless. XVII So that, when Death's transient slumber Seal my eyes,—my soul may be One among the countless number Ransom'd and redeem'd by Thee! TO THE CLOUDS. I Ye glorious pageants! hung in air To greet our raptur'd view; What in creation can compare, For loveliness, with you? II This earth is beautiful, indeed, And in itself appeals To eyes that have been taught to read The beauties it reveals. III Its giant mountains, which ascend To your exalted sphere, And seem at times with you to blend In majesty austere: IV Its lovely valleys, forests vast; Its rivers, lakes, and seas; With every glance upon them cast The sight, the sense must please. V And yet 'twere difficult to say How far our selfish views Lend, to Earth's beautiful array, Its most enchanting hues. VI It is not what we see, alone, Delights us most in this; But what we call, or dream our own, Yields self its highest bliss. VII Exceptions there may be, of course, Which he is blest who finds; But some such feeling is the source Of joy to vulgar minds. VIII A purer, more abstracted joy It gives to gaze on you; And feel what gladden'd once the boy, Is sweet to manhood's view. IX What can there be on sea, or earth, Though charms in each abound, Which you can fail to shadown forth, With added beauties crown'd? X When through the eastern gates of heaven The sun's first glories shine; Or when his softest beams are given To gild the day's decline; XI All glorious as that orb appears, His radiance still would lose Each gentle charm, that most endears, Without your soft'ning hues. XII When these with his refulgent rays Harmoniously unite, Who on your splendid pomp can gaze, Nor feel a hush'd delight? XIII 'Tis then, if to the raptur'd eye Her aid the fancy brings, In you our vision can descry Unutterable things! XIV Not merely mountains, cliffs, and caves, Domes, battlements, and towers, Torrents of light, that fling their waves O'er coral rocks, and bowers; XV Not only what to man is known In nature, or in art; But objects which on earth can own No seeming counterpart. XVI As once the Seer in Patmos saw Heaven's opening door reveal'd, And scenes inspiring love and awe To his rapt sight unseal'd: XVII So, in a faint and low degree, Through your unfoldings bright, Phantoms of glory yet to be Dawn on the wond'ring sight. XVIII Not even thought, and oh! much less The loftiest flights of verse, Can paint the power ye then possess Unworldly views to nurse. XIX It seems as if no dark eclipse By earth were interpos'd; But visions of the Apocalypse Before us were disclos'd. XX Nor are they false, deceitful dreams, Which wisdom should suppress; When dimm'd their most delightful gleams, Their memory still can bless. XXI The warm emotion they inspir'd In fond remembrance lives; As evening's sky, by you attir'd, Its lingering lustre gives. XXII And it remains to be the part Of wisdom — virtue too, To seize on all which in the heart Such feelings can renew; XXIII On all that for a season lifts From “Earth's contracted span” Our eyes, and thoughts; — and offers gifts Of noblest powers to man. XXIV The thousand cares that cumber life Write wrinkles on the brow; Yet these, with all their noise and strife, Are things to which we bow. XXV We call them useful; — so they are, If man their use would learn; And then from you, more glorious far, As idle shadows turn. XXVI But if ye lead our thoughts to Him Whose spirit space pervades, Then are ye, whether bright or dim, More than aerial shades. XXVII I would not underrate the boon The Gospel has proclaim'd; Nor give to clouds, winds, sun, or moon, His right who all has fram'd. XXVIII But viewing these as meant to feed Devotion's heaven-ward flame, His power and love, for whom they plead, I dare not but proclaim. XXIX Better, far better, not to be, Than — being — to resign The faith that all we feel and see Betokens Power Divine. XXX And rather than forego the thought, The feeling, ye supply, As silently ye sail athwart The blue, o'er-arching sky — XXXI Be mine the faith the Indian finds, Whom nature's night enshrouds, Who yet can hear a God in winds, And see Him in the clouds! DUNWICH. “Nature has left these objects to decay, That what we are, and have been, may be known.” I In Britain's earlier annals thou wert set Among the cities of our sea-girt isle: Of what thou wert — some tokens linger yet In yonder ruins; and this roofless pile, Whose walls are worshipless, whose tower — a mark, Left but to guide the seaman's wand'ring bark! II Yet where those ruins gray are scatter'd round, The din of commerce fill'd the echoing air; From these now crumbling walls arose the sound Of hallow'd music, and the voice of prayer: And this was unto some, whose names have ceas'd, The wall'd and gated city of the east! III Thus time, and circumstance, and change, betray The transient tenure of the worldly wise! Thus “Trade's proud empire hastes to swift decay,” And leaves no splendid wreck for Fame to prize: While Nature her magnificence retains, And from the contrast added glory gains. IV Still, in its billowy boundlessness out-spread, Yon mighty deep smiles to the orb of day, Whose brightness o'er this shatter'd pile is shed In quiet beauty. — Nature's early sway Is audible in winds that whisper round, — The soaring sky-lark's song, the breaker's hollow sound. Note. — To those who may think my epithet of “The wall'd and gated city of the East,” — somewhat hyperbolical as applied to Dunwich, I must submit an extract from Gardner's History of Dunwich, as containing at least traditional authority; though I fear little more. “The oldest inhabitants of this neighbourhood report, that Dun- “wich, (in ancient time,) was a city surrounded with a stone wall, “and brazen gates, had fifty-two churches, chapels, religious houses, “and hospitals, a king's palace, a bishop's seat, a mayor's mansion, “and a mint.” — He further states, in a following paragraph of his preface, his endeavours “to preserve the fate of that renowned “city, now almost swallowed up by the sea, from sinking into “oblivion, by collecting such occurrences dependent thereon, as “may perpetuate the memorial thereof to posterity.” — But, after all, Tradition has done more for the past glories of Dunwich than History, “Time's slavish Scribe,” has ever condescended to do. TO THE MEMORY OF THE AUTHOR'S FATHER. I Like the remembrance of a dream Recall'd imperfectly to thought; Thy form, thy features, sometimes seem To musing meditation brought. II And could the painter's mimic art Their semblance perfectly retrace, Thy memory would not, in my heart, Obtain a more enduring place. III All that such art might body forth Could but thy outward form display; It still would leave untold the worth Which has survived that form's decay. IV It still would leave each gem unguess'd, The casket transiently enshrin'd; Each virtue which adorn'd thy breast, Each talent that enrich'd thy mind. V Continue then, as thou hast been, A spirit, to my spirit known; By grosser sense unfelt, unseen; Belov'd, rever'd in thought alone. VI As such, thy image is more dear Than blazon'd in the costliest frame; As such, I still may think thee near, And bless thy memory, and thy name! A PORTRAIT. I I cannot call thy living form, And bid it stand before me; But Fancy, as my heart grows warm, Its semblance can restore me: For e'en that unsubstantial thing Must ever be enough to bring All better feelings o'er me; And give thee, for the time, to seem More than the phantom of a dream. II But, O! too warmly glows my heart, While thus in thought beholding thee, For me to act the artist's part, Embodying each sweet phantasy: Beauty there is, that painting mars; Morn's mists, noon's glory, night's bright stars, And moonlight on the mighty sea; And yet all these but things express Of unenduring loveliness. III But Thou, when unto me 'tis given Thy semblance to behold, Now seem'st more like a form from heaven, Than one of mortal mould; Which he who would thy Portrait draw, Turns from, o'ercome by love and awe, And leaves its charms untold. No! all I can do, love! must be To sketch what memory yields of thee. IV And ill may such a sketch convey, To those who knew thee well, What once thou wert; still less portray Those charms, whose gentle spell Survives thyself, still unforgot; Or give to those who knew thee not, Aught which of thee should tell. Thy dress, thy form, thy face — alone If given — might leave thee still unknown. V Thy form! avails it now to trace? Though once with charms endow'd: Thy dress ne'er boasted Fashion's grace, To satisfy the proud: Yet thou becam'st it well: and it On thee so gracefully did sit, My taste its charms avow'd; And in that simple garb — to me Thou wert — all thou couldst wish to be. VI Thy face, thy features, — boots it now To speak of what is fled, — Of eyes, or hair, or lips, or brow? When once the flower is dead, Its shape, its hue, no bliss can give; Its odours only seem to live, And lingering sweetness shed. If memory still that face enthral, 'Tis by the soul which spoke through all. VII Did it not speak? Oh! yes, it did — Not through the lips alone; That eye, beneath its downcast lid, Was eloquent in tone; For purest passion's gentle force, And thoughts which sprang from virtue's source, In all its glances shone: Orbs of more brilliant light I've seen, But none more tenderly serene. VIII Nor was the language of thy soul Less mutely eloquent In smiles that banish'd grief's control, Or hues that came and went In changeful beauty o'er that cheek, Telling far more than words could speak Of feelings innocent: Of truth, of tenderness, of love — Which Virtue could not but approve. IX But why thus dwell on traits, which ill Thy likeness can portray: Or linger over charms which still No semblance can convey? A loftier aim, blest shade! is mine, Than painter's art, though call'd divine, Would venture to essay: Nor would I, thus, some feelings wake, But for thy own, and Virtue's sake. X For these I would attempt to show A truth ill understood, Or one the world seems not to know; That much of truly good, Much that entwines itself around The inmost heart, and lives profound In memory's deepest mood, — May be attain'd; — and yet inspire Small scope for pencil or for lyre. XI Those virtues, gifts, and graces, — which In thee so meekly met, Boast more, existence to enrich, Than glittering gaudes; and yet — Delights we rather feel than see, Most difficult it well may be Before the eye to set. How can we even know their worth, Till absence gives such knowledge birth? XII To sympathies, which soothe and bless Our life, from day to day, Which throw, with silent tenderness, Fresh flowers across our way, The heart must ever fondly cling; But can the poet's sweetest string Their loveliness display? No — nor could Titian's self supply Their living presence, once gone by. XIII The air, in which we breathe and live, Eludes our touch and sight; The fairest flowers their fragrance give To stillness, and to night; The softest sounds that Music flings, In passing, from her heaven-plum'd wings, Are trackless in their flight! And thus life's sweetest bliss is known To silent, grateful thought alone. XIV But is it not, from hence, more pure, Ethereal, and divine? Yea! and its essence will endure When stars have ceas'd to shine. Time may the glowing canvass stain, Oblivion quench the poet's strain; But virtues — which entwine Their memory with undying love, Endure unchangeably above. XV “A meek and quiet spirit” gives, When earth's brief path is trod, 'To those it bless'd — what still outlives That spirit's senseless clod; Feelings and thoughts, in part divine, Which live along the length'ning line Of being — up to God! And terminate their blissful course In union with their parent source! XVI Believing such high destiny To be thy blest estate; Immortal spirit! can I sigh Thy lot to contemplate? No — and though little there might seem In thee for bard's, or painter's theme, Of high, of rich, of great, Yet beyond rank, wealth, beauty, — all! I love thy virtue's gentler thrall. TO THE MEMORY OF WILLIAM HEY. For a full account of this estimable Man and pious Christian, see his “Life” by Pearson: also “The Christian Observer,” and “Christian Guardian.” I Preacher of Righteousness! for such Wert thou in preaching's noblest sense, Whose life and conversation touch Hearts cold to pulpit eloquence; — Preacher of Righteousness, farewell! With Thee may I hereafter dwell. II What though no weekly audience hung Upon the accents of thy voice, Nor thus collected from thy tongue What bade them tremblingly rejoice; Yet did thy lamp so brightly shine, A silent ministry was thine. III A Preacher — by the sick man's bed, In the mute, eloquent display Of those meek charms that ever shed Their lustre round the Christian's way; And these may often deeply move, Where words would ineffectual prove. IV A Preacher — in the narrow sphere (Delightful to the human heart) Which Nature's tenderest bonds endear, By the deep feelings they impart; And in afflictions that must prove At once the Man's, the Christian's love. V For who can thy “Memorial” The Memorial on the death of one of his children. read, And not unfeignedly repeat This truth — that through the Christian creed, “Hard things are easy, bitter — sweet?” Proudest philosophy could never Have thus taught Nature's ties to sever. VI Christian Philosopher! not thine The praise by such meek Vict'ry won; God gave thee power — by grace divine, And Faith confirm'd it through his Son! Nor does submission lose its force, Thus trac'd unto its holiest source. VII Virtues our fallen nature bears, Where these appear to linger still, May, or may not find fitting heirs, As we are strong or weak of will; If conscious weakness be our lot, We read, admire, but profit not. VIII Not so when every gift and grace Are with humility referr'd To Him who died to save our race; — Even to that eternal word Which to our weakness power can give, And bid the dead awake, and live. IX Here is the secret, hid of old E'en from the prudent and the wise! 'Mid faults and frailties manifold, The Christian upon Christ relies: And, conscious of his Captain's right, Is more than conqu'ror through his might. X Through humble trust in him is given The vict'ry over sin and death; Hopes that ascend from earth to heaven, And prayer, and praise, and holy faith, — Faith which, in every age, hath been The evidence of things unseen. XI This is the faith that works by love; Effectual to the purifying Of hearts — whose hallow'd feelings prove A Saviour's love their own supplying, — The gift of God, through grace divine, And such, departed saint! was thine. XII Other foundation none can lay Than that which is already laid; “The Light, the Life, the Truth, the Way;” Salvation by the cross display'd! In this was plac'd thy dying trust, And this shall consecrate thy dust. WHAT IS LIFE? A cloudy day, lit up by transient gleams; The fearful brightness of a shooting star; The dazzling loveliness of fleeting dreams, Which frowning phantoms in succession mar: — Such, such is life! A bowl which sparkles brightly at its brim, But soon upon the sated palate palls; A sun-bright view, which shadows quickly dim; A strain — whose music on no echo falls: — Such, such is life! O for a state more glorious far than this! Where mutability no more is known; But souls redeem'd, partaking heavenly bliss, With humble gratitude and praise may own This, this is life! ON THE RETURN OF SUMMER BIRDS. FROM THE FRENCH OF DE LILLE. Return, return to your haunts again, And greet their shades with your sweetest strain; Inhabit once more your cherish'd groves, And renew your summer songs and loves. What need ye to add to your lovely mirth? Yours is the water, the air, and earth; Woke under the foliage by zephyr's sigh, With songs for the ear, and tints for the eye. Your wants are few; ye alike disdain The vices of luxury's slothful reign, And the rigour of laws that men revere, But which you in your liberty need not fear. A stroke of the wing is your rudest law To keep a coquetting lover in awe; And so simple your toilette, your ruffled plumes A touch of the beak with beauty illumes. Though to shores remote your flight you bear, Ye are travellers blithe, and not exiles there; The grove where you plighted your former vows Sees you build again in its leafy boughs; The same thick shade in its solitude Hears your soft vows of love renew'd, And the same sweet echoes lingering nigh Once more to your joyful songs reply. INFANCY. I The Snow-drop, herald of the spring, In storm or sunshine born, Some passing images may bring Of being's varied morn. II When blasts are chill, and clouds are dark, Its helpless, fragile bloom Appears as set for misery's mark, To sink in hopeless gloom. III If mild the gale, and bright the beam, Its beauties charm the eye, And, while we gaze, we almost dream That summer hours are nigh. IV But trustless are the outward signs Which waken hope or fear; The flower whose birth in sunlight shines, Chill blasts the soonest sere. V The bud that cold winds nipt at first, A happier lot may know; In warmer airs to life may burst, In brighter sunshine glow. VI Thus shall the nursling of despair Fond sighs and tears requite; And shine in after life more fair Than some whose morn was bright. BOYHOOD. I The Rose which greets the smile of June, Unfolding in its joy, When birds and bees their carols tune, May typify The Boy. II Light clouds, that pass in shadow o'er, Render its hues more bright; Soft showers may fall, yet these restore Fresh fragrance to delight. III And thus the shade on boyhood's cheek By smiles is chas'd away; The tear which transient grief would speak But leaves the eye more gay. IV The clouds whose darkness threatens life, Winds of autumnal tone, Of Winter's storms the fearful strife — To it are things unknown. V Unknown to Boyhood, too, the storms Which after years may roll O'er all the beauty that now forms The summer of its soul. VI But mind, immortal, through the gloom May glorious warfare wage; And know, when faded Boyhood's bloom, Fresh greenness in old age. MANHOOD. I The ripen'd corn which clothes in gold The autumnal landscape round, Is fair; as comely to behold Is ripen'd Manhood found. II Hope to fruition now must yield, The joy of harvest nigh, In all its plenteousness reveal'd Before the gazer's eye. III If cultureless that soil had laid, What now could be its own, Be what they might its light and shade, But barrenness alone? IV Nor can mere Manhood bring to view Aught more to be enjoyed, If the mind's spring and summer too Have pass'd by unemployed. V Yet seed well sown, and ripe to reap, May profit fail to win; Prudence no jubilee will keep, Unknown the gathering in. VI When safe into the garner brought, The triumph is secure; And then, alone, to grateful thought The joy of harvest pure! OLD AGE. I The scath'd and leafless tree may seem Old Age's mournful sign; Yet on its bark may sunshine gleam, And moonlight softly shine. II Thus on the cheek of age should rest The light of years gone by, Calm as the glories of the west When night is drawing nigh. III As round that scath'd trunk fondly clings The ivy green and strong, Repaying, by the grace it brings, The succour granted long; — IV So round benevolent Old Age May objects yet survive, Whose greenness can the eye engage, And keep the heart alive. V Grant that no ivy-wreaths it know, But fell'd at last to earth, Its relics from the hearth may glow, — Who shall deny its worth? VI Not cheerless is the symbol found, If, while it can supply Delight to living hearts around, Its smoke ascends on high! ON A PORTRAIT OF BEATRICE CENCI: IN THE COLLECTION AT BREDFIELD HOUSE, THE RESIDENCE OF JOHN FITZGERALD, ESQ. I It haunts me still! that lovely face, With beauty's own undying power, Whose pure, imaginative grace Exists beyond its mortal hour. II That brow so thoughtful, yet so fair, Might tell of sorrow's chilling shade, But patient gentleness is there Each mournful feeling to upbraid. III Those features, moulded to delight In hours of mirth the gazer's eye, Are more than beautifully bright With sorrow's calm sublimity. IV 'Tis not a face to charm awhile, By common art or outward spell, Whose transient power of look or smile All who behold at once can tell. V Nor is it one which, left behind, Can mingle with forgotten things; Calm, energetic, full of mind, Round it the heart's fond memory clings — VI Clings mournfully; while thought would shun The woes in which it was a sharer; Joy may boast many a brighter one, But sorrow never own'd a fairer. A BIRTH-DAY. I “A Birth-day!” — what a joyful sound Those words possess'd to boyhood's ear, When Fancy shed her sunshine round; And Hope, the flatterer, still was near, With balm for every trifling wound, A smile for every tear! II Then life was sweet: the world, unknown, A fairy landscape bright and gay; Each voice, too, seem'd like Friendship's tone, Or Love's more fascinating lay; And Time — a playmate of my own, To sport with by the way. III What is a Birth-day now? — A sound To shake e'en manhood's sterner heart; Fancy no sunshine sheds around, And Hope has lost her healing art, While from the world's enchanted ground Its brighter hues depart. IV Pain's barbed shafts mock Friendship's shield, Love's smile can ill dark tempests brave, Time's scythe no longer is conceal'd, And Life has little left to crave; Hope, Fancy, Friendship, Love must yield Their votary to the grave. V I speak, 'tis true, of passing things, Which appertain to Time and Earth — Happy is he whose spirit clings To thoughts of more enduring worth, To whom the day of death but brings More joy than that of birth! TO A BUTTERFLY. TRANSLATED FROM THE FRENCH. I Born with the balmy breath of Spring, With fragrant roses dying, With Zephyr's light and sportive wing In playful motion vying. II Bright as the pure and cloudless blue Of heaven above, — or blossom That opes its chalice, as to woo Thy beauty to its bosom. III Intoxicated with perfume, With light and azure glowing; From wings surcharg'd with youthful bloom Thy feathery glory throwing. IV Then borne away, like thought or breath, To viewless, endless distance, How lovely in thy life and death Appears thy brief existence! V A gentle wish, a soft desire, To fancy, it resembles, Which, ardent, restless, would aspire To bliss — at which it trembles: — VI But still, unsatisfied below, Just glances o'er each treasure, Then soars whence brighter splendours flow, To seek for purer pleasure. SMILES AND TEARS. I Speechless interpreters of thought, And feeling's hidden dower; With eloquence resistless fraught, How touching is your power! II In Joy's ecstatic mood, what tone To gladness can beguile, With fascination of its own, Like rapture's silent smile? III In anguish — what can more reveal Than all that meets the ear? What but the eloquent appeal Of Sorrow's silent tear! IV In Love, — to those who truly know What smiles and tears can say, More of the hidden heart they show Than language can convey. V And in that purer element, Ethereal and divine, Which thought and feeling represent As Worship's purest shrine; VI Far far beyond the influence That rhetoric most reveres, The spirit's holier eloquence Of silent smiles and tears. VII The patient suff'rer's smile, when born Of Faith, to God is dear; Nor will His mercy ever scorn Contrition's voiceless tear! THE CONCLUSION. I 'Tis past the midnight hour, and yet I linger o'er this page awhile, As if I half indulg'd regret, For what might rather prompt a smile; II A mournful smile, at hopes that shed Their lustre, when my task began; Which, like the hours between, are fled, As now my closing leaf I scan. III It was a lovely Summer's morn That first inspir'd my opening page; Of thoughts and feelings brightly born Hope was the nat'ral heritage. IV Stern Winter's winds are sweeping by As now I linger o'er my last; And Hope, like yonder starless sky, By clouds is darkly overcast. V But thou, A profile of the Author's mother. in hope and gloom the same, Dear silent shade! art with me yet: Filial affection owns thy claim, And fondly chides each vain regret. VI For had these pages never lent Another source of joy to me, I owe them many hours, thus spent In quient solitude with thee. VII Nor could this volume hope an end My heart more gratefully would own, Than feeling thus thy image blend With her's, who could thy loss atone. VIII With her's, who so perform'd the part Which Heaven but gave thee — to resign, That childhood's unsuspecting heart Knew not an earlier claim was thine. THE END.</field>
