      <field name="fulltext">WILD-FLOWERS OF WESTMORELAND. Wild-flowers from England's Arcady!—By these, Dear Rotha, thanks to Her whose gracious hand Gather'd, and with hermetic skill preserved For us the delicate treasures—we may yet, Ev'n in the tame South, repossess the fells, The dingles, and the haunts of water-falls That cleave “the flowery rocks,” and we may roam By lake and cataract along the banks Where these were born and Thou,—For these dried flowers Are Fancy's passports to their native land; And though so far from home, and never more To nod and balance to the mountain breeze And sparkle through the spangles of the dew, Yet is their summer glory but prolong'd Within this dainty Herbal, and the bloom That would have quickly shrivell'd into dust, Here in perennial loveliness survives, Breathing the breath of voices from the North.— Thus sun-dyed fancies, airy reveries, Freaks of imagination, waking dreams, Ephemeral fantasies of playful hues, Fade into nothing if uncropt, and die Forgotten; but if seized on while yet fresh In their rich tints of light, and so consigned To the bland pressure of judicious thought And chaste constraint of language, they become Heirlooms for after-times; and when the door Of life has closed upon their parent-mind, They tell us of the garden where they grew: Relics of Eden-land, with fondness prized After the gates of paradise are shut. What have we here? The Muse's own plant first: Grass of Parnassus, with its lofty flowers In silver lustre poised, each on its stalk, A tall thin pillar leafless; while the leaves, Each on its separate stem, dwell near the ground, Like poor and lowly relatives, abash'd, Yet clinging conscious to their common root. Or, rather, those aspiring flowers are symbols Of minds that soar to fancy's altitudes, And live in radiance for a little while, And wither in the sun; while the green leaves, Content to 'bide near home, caress their roots, And thence imbibe sure nurture.—What comes next? The Silver Dew! so euphonously named! A simple flower enough, in gilding rich, But with such lovely foliage as might task An Indian carver's skill on ivory— Fan-moss as delicately elegant:— And Lady's Mantle, fairer flowers and leaves Than ever lady's fingers finely work'd; Lo, deadly Nightshade, and its mate th' Enchanter, Perfidious lurker in the rocky woods! And baleful Hemlock!—Kindlier herbs are near.— The Harebell blithe—pensive Forget-me-not;— And gay Heart's-ease, “the pansy freakt with jet,” “The little western flower” of many names, And sweeter none than “Love in Idleness.” Behold a stately wand, the Golden Rod That waved o'er Stockghyll Force, as if to charm The waters' tumult.—The Wild-thyme that stills With bribes the wild bees' murmurs, and when crush'd By upland wanderer's foot, for evil good Returning, greets the oppressor with its balm. The Bird's-eye Primrose, of pink flowers minute, That flush the Kendal meads in stem and leaf Expansive as the redbreast's outstretch'd wing. Bird's-foot, wing-heel'd like Hermes! A tress or two Of Maiden-hair: and Cotton-grass has lent A carded whitelock from its elfin head. Here Ragged Robin, undespised, finds place; And here the Bramble, though its touch be rude. Culbrake and Parsley-fern, and many a fern Besides, and many a heath: and Sweet-gale, too, Both for its balmy name, and flower-like cones Diminutive. Stone-bramble, from the top of Silverhow, For Barber's Mr. Barber, a former friend and neighbour. memory (and a yew-tree sprig Were welcome from his grave on Grasmere side). This purple bell is of the Foxglove tall, “A weed of glorious feature,” the delight Of rocky Westmoreland's melodious bees, The glory of its craggy wildernesses, And fondly designated “Fairy's Love.” Flower of the wind, the wild Anemone, Queen of the meadows, the tall Meadow-sweet, Oppressive sweet on Rotha's banks, are here; And here from soft Winander's, the Livelong, A bud of Elleray; for Wilson's sake, For Hamilton's and gentle Farquhar's sakes, Welcome and kindly welcome!—The Musk-mallow, Blue Violet, and Summer Violet blond; Here is White heather from Winander's isle; And Lily of the Vale of Windermere, Blue glistening Eye-bright, delicate of stem, Fibre, and leaflet, with consummate flowers, Fit wreath for Ariel's self, to match his eyes. Look at the fen-born lady, Pimpernel, The purple Money-wort, whose sentient petals Close to the touch of damp, (although its roots, In fine thread cables clinging to the joints Of its prone stems, cast anchor in the moist And spongy turf,) and so th' affected flower, Nurtured in moisture yet, with low-bred airs Fastidious, shrinking from the external damp, Has yet its use—“the Shepherd's Weather-glass.” The pretty Speedwell, and of larger leaf Though bud as small, its namesake, also call'd “Man's Faith” by rural maidens: would'st thou know Wherefore? then listen to the veriest tale Of falseness, and the saddest. Patient hopes Sustain'd the heart of Emily for years, While in the Babel upon Thames afar, The vicar's son, her lover, tried his way To wealth, whose distant prospect was his heaven, Up through the slippery mazes of the Law; That hollow, hideous, slime-cemented pile Which ends in jargon. Poor as he began, He long remain'd; but honest not so long. Keen student in a circumventive school, Villain he soon became, and when that word Was writ in ink Satanic on his mind, Saint on his breast he labell'd. He became So smooth all over: sentiment, voice, look, Were so quicksilvery smooth; and then his eye, Demurely bland, would ever and anon, Upturning, roll and quiver with a zeal So sanctimonious, and he so would make The trembling vowels bleat between his lips, And make some consonants so strangely twang, That many a worthy soul, devoid of guile, Was wheedled into confidences rash And treacherous toils of law: a fleecing caitiff, Fleece-clad, he keenly prowl'd among the flocks. Such was true Emily's false love! but how? Her passion was the prejudice of chance Ingrafted on her childhood. They were mates Who hunted butterflies, and daisies pick'd, And laugh'd and wept together, trifle-moved, In infancy's sweet spring. Through youth they lived By neighbourhood allied, just not so near But that a blank of absence now and then, Made itself felt: and when the hour was come That call'd the slender youth of silvery voice To charm his way to fortune in the south, He hung upon her neck, and kiss'd her cheek, And vow'd a hundred vows, and all sincere: For he was yet a novice, and believed Himself, and Emily believed him too. She was the daughter of a Cumbrian squire, A luckless man, whose acres were but few, And children many: this, the fairest girl Of all his household, not uncultured grew Like the wild shoots among the rocky clefts Of those Arcadian moors and pastures, green For flocks as wildly devious as the rills That filter slowly through the grass, or leap From stone to stone at random. Careful hands Had train'd her up to womanhood: and home To her had been a plain domestic school Of duties strictly taught and aptly learnt: And, being one of many, she had miss'd A share undue of those caresses fond, And cares minute, and praises undeserved, Which suffocate young virtue with a warmth To nought but folly genial, and conceit. Thus nurtured, mind and frame together grew In health and strength, each fortifying each, And each supplying to the other, grace And beauty, or perpetual interchange With gain to both; substance and spirit freshening Each other, as the broad-leaved branches fan And cool the air that fans and freshens them. Hers was a temper less by nature tuned Than harmonised by discipline to rule, And by religion sanctified to peace. Through the small trials of a crowded home, And all the petty interests that jar, She soothed and smiled her way to happiness. From eyes that seldom wept, that youth's farewell Drew virtuous tears: but she was happy still, For she was true and trustful. Now and then, While yet a struggler in the jostling crowds That haunt the dens impure misnamed of Law, He homeward turn'd his course, rebraced his pale And dissolute frame among his native hills, And sunn'd the wretched thing he call'd his heart In Emily's clear loveliness. At last He came in triumph: the attorney's clerk Was now a partner in the Belial-house, Where he had served apprenticeship to guile. He came to ask a bride: the parents heard Without dissent, for poverty's shrewd pinch Rebuked the faint suspicion that disturb'd Their tenderness by whispering, Lurks there not Beneath this smooth mind's varnish something false? It could not be! They knew him from his cradle, And he was ever gentle. Not a fear Speck'd the serene security of bliss, The heaven in Emily's bosom. One fair noon They saunter'd up a dingle of gray rocks With oaken wildwood crested to a bank Alive with Speedwell flowers, whose bright blue eyes Glisten'd in welcome, as it seem'd, to greet The happy lovers. On that slope they sat, And while he wreathed a garland of those flowers Sportive around her neck, as if she were A lamb for sacrifice, he told her how “A German maiden saw a tuft of Speedwell More beauteous than its fellows, half-way lodged Down a steep margin of the Danube flood. ‘Pluck me that wild germander!’ to the youth She said, whose place was at her side. He stoop'd And pluck'd it, but the slippery ground betray'd His feet, and deep into the stream he sunk; He rose and struggled towards the bank, and threw The prize ashore, and to the maiden cried ‘Forget-me-not,’ and sunk to rise no more. And hence that flower was call'd Forget-me-not, The name we give a smaller flower as blue, A floweret golden-eyed:—behold!”—And here He show'd a ring whereon were radiant stones, Five sapphires, and a beryl in the midst, Set in the likeness of that well-known flower Of memory! Saying thus, her hand he took— It trembled unresisting—and that ring Upon the bridal finger as he placed, “Wear this, dear Emily,” he added, “till, A few weeks hence it be displaced by one Of simpler structure, but of force to link Thee and thy fate to me and mine for ever.”— Think you the brook that warbled to that bank A mountain melody, was half so sweet As was the voice of him who thus address'd The observant heart of Emily? Was he A traitor then?—oh, no! he yet believed His spirit true to Her, although he knew 'Twas false to all things else of pure and good. That night they parted:—and they never met Again!—To London journeying, he paused To seek at Harrogate a dwelling where He and his bride-elect might shortly pass Their earliest weeks of wedlock. There indeed His honeymoon was pass'd: but the betroth'd Was not the bride! A golden dupe he found, A serious heiress: she was charm'd to see His grave peculiar smile, and charm'd yet more To hear his voice, still sweeter than his smile. He smiled, and talk'd, and snared the splendid prize. The twain were quickly one. No word was sent To Emily; no friend was interposed To break the tidings; 'twas a perfidy Too gross for explanation. When she read The strange announcement mix'd with common news, She lifted up her soul to Heaven and pray'd For strength to bear the trial: strength was given. Her spirit droop'd not in its gentle pride; But, for the agony was sharp, the rose Was stricken out for ever from her cheek, For ever and at once; and in a night, Strange freak of suffering and yet true, one lock Of her rich hair, and one alone, was blanched; And gleam'd among her auburn tresses dark In signal contrast, like the first snow-flake That nestles on a copper beech-tree's bough. Her rounded form, too, by degrees refined To such sylph-like tenuity, that it seem'd A plaything for a zephyr, yet endured The mountain blasts, unshatter'd, many a year. And years had pass'd away, and never word Had she of him once utter'd; till, one day, Upon that very bank, enamell'd still With flowers of wild germander, a small child, Her pupil, holding up a flower new-pluck'd, Inquired its name. The marble cheek and brow Of Emily to paler whiteness turn'd:— Her eyes commerced with memory; the string That tied the tongue of agony was snapt; She wrung her hands and wept aloud, and cried “Man's Faith!”—The name is constant to the flower. A FLOWER OF FAIRFIELD. As once I roam'd the fells, to brood, In silence and in solitude, On fancies all my own, In one of Nature's hiding spots I found a flower as shy as thoughts That love to be alone; A primrose in a nook enshrined; A rocky cleft with mosses lined, And over-arch'd with fern; And guarded well from wandering hoof, By two rough sentries arm'd in proof— A bramble and a thorn. Wrens hide not in more jealous cells Their precious hoard of speckled shells, Than that where hidden blew This golden treasure of the Spring, As brightly delicate a thing As ever Eden knew. This is the very type, said I, Of yon fair nymph, so lone and shy, Whose spirit charms the wild! And hither from her laurell'd nook, On this her floral self to look, I led the Poet's Child. Together on the vernal gem, That seem'd to tremble to its stem With trouble not its own, We gazed as silent as the flower; But never from that happy hour My heart has been alone. Rydal Mount. THE HELIOTROPE AND THE SNOWDROP. That flower, in scented garments fine, Came first from regions of the mine, And soon its worth is told:— Oppressive in its rich pretence, Its very sweetness hath a sense Analogous to gold. A thing of luxury, worldly-wise! A true sun-worshipper, whose eyes Pursue the God of Day:— But if a cloud deface his beam, 'Twill drop its cunning lids, and seem A worshipper of clay. Begone, thou type of summer friends! The flower that winter's death-bed tends Give me, in spite of scorn! Begone, Peruvian Heliotrope! Give me the snow-born Flower of Hope, The Flower of Hope forlorn. THE NIGHT-SCENTED STOCK. Other flowers are not content, Vestal-like, to live and die, Prodigal of hue or scent, They must bloom for passers-by. Bright-eyed triflers kindly scattering Smiles for all, in vain display; Or with incense sweetly flattering Good or bad that cross their way! Not like them this Stock, that only Seems to wake when sunbeams sleep; (Skill'd in close reserve, and lonely, All its balm till night to keep). Then its subtle sense unsheathing, With its pierces to the brain Of the lonely poet, breathing To the stars his midnight strain. THE BIRCH OF SILVER-HOW. WRITTEN FOR MR. BARBER OF GRASMERE. I'll doubt no more that Fairies dwell At least in one enchanted place, Though wisdom long since rang the knell Of Oberon and all his race: They haunt Kehlbarrow's woody brow, Amid the rocks of Silver-How! And if you climb beyond the wood You'll there a Fairy chapel see; And there, in spite of wind and flood, Beside it find a goodly tree: Of upright stem and flexile bough, The Fairy-tree of Silver-How. A night of tempest shook the hills That circle Grasmere's lovely lake; To torrents swoln, the flashing rills Went chafing down o'er stone and brake: When morning peep'd o'er Fairfield's brow Low lay the birch of Silver-How! The red-breast that was wont to sing His matins on its topmost spray, Now wheel'd aloof his fickle wing To chaunt elsewhere his roundelay: To thriving trees his court he paid So well he knew the poet's trade. The Sun went down, but when again He rose and look'd on Silver-How, The red-breast trill'd his morning strain Upon his old accustom'd bough: For lo! the tree that prostrate lay, Erectly stood in face of day. It rose, untouch'd by human hands, And now a living wonder stands On that enchanted Fell! Wise sceptic, you deny in vain To wild Kehlbarrow's fairy fane A priestess and a spell: Go profit by my elfin creed, And lift the fallen in their need As secretly and well! Rydal Mount, October 27, 1829. CHESNUT TREES NEAR BRAGA. WRITTEN BEFORE THE ABOLITION OF MONASTERIES IN PORTUGAL. Old sylvans in a land of monks, Your moss-furr'd boughs, and wrinkled trunks All hollow from their roots, Would speak you worn-out serfs of Time; Yet fresh, as if in tree-hood's prime, You bear your leaves and fruit. Yon Elders of the Cowl, who dwell Like worms within the kernell'd shell, In choice monastic nooks, This moral of your green old age, Might deign to learn from Nature's page, The second-best of books. THE CANARY GOLDFINCH. At Paris, in the month of June, Within the square of Carrousel, We heard as blithe a voice in tune, As ever trill'd from wiry cell. A hundred songsters dinn'd the wall With music—'twas a bird-slave mart; But one pied hybrid o'er them all Sang triumph in his strength of heart. He reign'd by innate power of voice O'er all his rivals sweet and shrill, Their Monarch self-acclaim'd by choice No other than his vocal will. To sing him down they oft broke out In vain they one and all rebell'd; Prolong'd through “many a winding bout” His roundelay the triumph held. Born in a cage, to reach his throne, A perch, was all his use for wings: Happier than He who made his own Yon palace of the Bourbon Kings. But birds no more than men can long Evade Parisian glory's fate: This golden-feather'd lord of song Was now compell'd to abdicate. By foreign hands was he deposed, By foreign hands to exile borne; We brought him to a vale enclosed By mountains that delay the morn. How fared he then? at such a change Perhaps at first his taste revolted; These rocks and quiet meads were strange, But soon his city feelings moulted. No bird Ovidian to lament His Tiber in a weary strain, He sang on Rotha's banks content As if he ne'er had known the Seine. He found in Her who brought him thence, A nature he could understand, Endearing to his subtle sense Of harmony, a foreign land. Yet once, as if her cheerful care But tantalised caprice, away He flitted to the cliffs, and there He play'd the truant half a day. We thought him lost, and sigh'd to think On what might be the rover's doom, For hawks o'er-eye the craggy brink, And owlets haunt the woody gloom. Who knows not danger knows not fear:— But soon he found his freedom pall; Ere eventide his carol clear Announced him at the garden-wall. A moment's pause—a sudden whirr And lo, the prize was ours again! He could not tarry long from her For whom he had forgot the Seine. But when her voice no more was heard, But when her smile no more was seen, He ceased to be the glossy bird, The bright-eyed warbler he had been. From day to day, from week to week, He miss'd his friend and pined away; His note became a sound to seek, A fitful effort at a lay. Though now and then he plainly strove, By little fond familiar ways, To thank us for the watchful love That fain would have prolong'd his days. And when he died, this very morn, Of moss I made his winding-sheet, And, in a mood the wise may scorn, Her bird I buried at her feet. February 26, 1848. WANSFELL. It was only yester-eve, While the sun was taking leave Of the mountain he loves best, Tawny Wansfell seem'd to grieve— For I saw the brackens heave On his breast. And I heard his firs bewailing, With a shudder first, and quailing From the tidings of the breeze; Then in a chorus firmer, With a long and sweeping murmur, Like the sea's. It was not for daylight's setting, That his russet ferns were fretting, While his groves were thrill'd with fear, For the light returns to-morrow, But not he for whom they sorrow— The Old Year. The last hour was drawing nigh, Of the mountain's true ally, In the merry seasons past:— As a friend about to perish, With a fonder love we cherish At the last: So the mountain seem'd revealing A regret like human feeling While the twilight round it hung; But ere night had pass'd away, And the dawn of New-Year's Day Upward sprung, What had changed the mourner's face? Not a feature can we trace! We behold a giant white, From whose robe of silver tissue, Ten thousand sparkles issue, Jewel-bright. After all his rustic nurture, The old mountain has turn'd courtier, And to greet the New-Year's Day He has deck'd his shoulders proud, From his wardrobe in the cloud, All so gay. All night on silent Wansfell A shower like down of swans fell, A shower of frosted dew: And the shroud of the Old Year, Is the mountain's festal gear For the New. January 1, 1843. RYDAL-BECK, WESTMORELAND. A mountain stream that descends through Lady Fleming's park, forming two waterfalls on the mountain side, and then flows leisurely through the lower grounds into the Rotha. Foal of the well-spring and the cloud, The young white horse, so fierce and proud, Has broken forth from home! What turf-train'd courser but would shun With such a Colt a race to run On such a Hippodrome? O'er shelving reef, down craggy wall, Full gallop comes the waterfall, Then lights on glass-like ground; The beauteous pool beneath him quakes, But thence away—away—he breaks, With a disdainful bound. Fresh ferns, soft mosses, wild buds gay, In vain are waiting by his way, To tempt him to a check; The trees' lithe arms are stretch'd in vain To stop him, till he reach the plain; No lasso Lasso, the South American noose with which wild horses are caught. for his neck! The Dryad echo, hid aloof, Lurks list'ning, till his sonorous hoof Approaches her retreat; Then forth, and leaps upon his back! A rash equestrian, if she lack The skill to keep her seat. And hark! already she is off, Sent shrieking, to the mimic scoff Of lordly mountains round! From that light weight the insulted steed A single vigorous plunge has freed, A headlong plunge profound. But where is now that steed of force? Or was it but a spectral horse? Or whither did he pass? I see a narrow streamlet take Its course through Rydal Park—a snake Of silver in the grass. Strange transformation! oft we see Blind Passion fall from high degree, With headlong noisy pride; Then, changed in nature as in place, Through life's low vale, with sinuous grace, In quiet meekness glide. These lines were suggested by a walk in Rydal Park, December 15, 1837, but composed on May Day, 1838, at Canterbury. DALEGARTH FORCE. What great voice of Birker Moor, With a loud and louder lure, Tempts us up this stony brook? Dalegarth's haunted Ghyll is near! 'Tis the Water Spirit's call! Onward, stranger, see and hear— Hearken to the Waterfall;— Hearken and look! Fairer scene was ne'er beholden; Wilder Fall thou wilt not list: There the mosses, green and golden, Bathe in brightening showers of mist; Wild flowers there, in motley dresses, Careless dip their colours gay; There the birch tree droops her tresses, Shining through the web of spray,— While the Water Spirit presses Through the granite chaos grey; Yet, as his own shout confesses, Cannot get away; Flinging off, with vain endeavour, Chains that leave him chainless never,— There he chafes and foams for ever Night and day. A SEA LYRIC. In Three Parts. The first part, except the seventh and ninth stanzas, was rhymed on board the “Manchester” steam-ship in the bight of the Bay of Biscay, November, 1836, when the storm was rising, but before the sense of danger was thoroughly roused by its violence and the damage to both engines. The rest was written at Canterbury, April 23, 1838, from memory. PART I. I I've stood a gale before now; And do I shrink at last, Where wind and wave but roar now Their old accustom'd blast? II Ye gusts and seas of Biscay, And thou Atlantic main, Ye oft have served me this way When I have steer'd for Spain. III Old friends expect, at meeting, A welcome fair or foul; You give a churlish greeting— A bluster and a growl! IV Yet all your rant and railing, Till now, I ever heard With spirit as unquailing As any ocean-bird: V The Gull, of constant pinion, The Willock, sleek of form, Your little fearless minion The Petrel of the Storm; VI Or any winged skimmers That ride the leaping foam, Or e'en the deeper swimmers Beneath the tides at home. VII But now, appall'd, I hear ye, Ye stunning voices wild! Ye winds and waves, I fear ye— I tremble for my child. VIII Bold wave, thy salt lip kisses A cheek whose rose it frets; Shrewd wind, thy sharp tongue hisses In ears unused to threats! IX Be hush'd, thou angry giant, And sleek thy bristling hair; O sea, for once compliant, O hear a Father's prayer! PART II. I “Ha, ha! the Wanderer's Daughter Is mine!” the Demon said; The Demon of the water, With horrent laughter dread. II “Blow, blow, ye merry Tritons, Blow, blow with all your might, And call the cloud that lightens, For dark will be the night! III “On yon Iberian breakers This vapour-ship must strike, That ploughs the ocean's acres As free as Thames's dyke. IV “But first, stout billows shackle The power that rules her keel; Fair play to sheet and tackle, But down with work and wheel!” V The surge obey'd its warrant, And wheel and engine crash'd; A hulk on Biscay's current, The steam-bark landward dash'd. VI And nought can helm avail her To keep her head to sea; All evil blasts assail her, And force her to the lee. VII And still she sinks and rises, And pants along at speed; Ten minutes bring the crisis— God help her in her need! VIII And by the light of lightning, To those on deck who stand, The breakers dimly whitening, Seem to beckon from the land. IX “A sail, a sail to wear her, Or she her last has cruised!” And twice they tried to wear her, And twice the ship refused. PART III. I The Father sought his Daughter, And drew her from her berth, And in his arms he caught her, And held her in that girth. II And, in her eyeballs gazing, He whisper'd all the truth; O God! the doom amazing, It shook her heart of youth. III Her lips were white with wonder, She sank on trembling knees; Her prayer, through ocean's thunder, Christ heard, who walk'd the seas. IV Again was rigg'd the canvas,— That effort seem'd despair's; How sweet the voice of man was, That cried “She wears! she wears!” V A counter-breeze from Finisterre, Of God's own under-breath, Was now the blessed minister Of rescue from the death! VI Away the crippled vessel Went limping from the coast, With many a wave to wrestle, And little strength to boast. VII And when the sun was risen, And show'd the waste profound, It seem'd again a prison Of mountains quaking round! VIII But when did Christ deliver With vacillating hand? We gain'd the Golden River, And touch'd the Lisbon strand! A MOST RICH AND PERFECTLY DEFINED RAINBOW ON THE OCEAN. One lady on the tall white cliff! One boat upon the sea! That little solitary skiff Why watcheth Emma Lee? The heavens with sulphurous clouds are black: As black the billowy plain; And wildly flies the stormy rack Above the stormy main. The winged ships their wings have spread, For safety far from land; The sea-birds from the sea have fled For shelter, to the strand. Then why intent on yonder shell That scuds before the gale? Why like a lone coast sentinel, Stands there that lady pale? Perhaps a brother's life to threat, Those mighty waters rise; Perhaps some object dearer yet, The treasure of her eyes! And as the waters heave and break, Her breast keeps fearful time; Her very heart-strings all awake To that tremendous chime. And on that cliff, so far above, She stands in beauty pale, To be the beacon-light of love, To guide his daring sail. No brother in that lonely boat Is menaced by the strife; No cherish'd lover there afloat, Fights with the surge for life. Her brow is pale with fear and hope, With holy hope and fear, Which high as heaven direct their scope, While humbly trembling here. That boat to her the type presents Of man's immortal soul, Struggling through turbid elements, The passions—to its goal. The sun is hid behind the clouds, But is not gone to sleep, For now a ray has touch'd the shrouds, A rainbow spans the deep. And now the salient canvas shines, All boldly out in white, Beneath its glorious arch of lines Of many-colour'd light. Thus from behind the curtain dark Will flash a beam of grace, When terrors shake the sinner's bark, And tears are on his face. And see! the boat is safe within The strong protecting mole; So safely from the gulfs of sin, A refuge finds the soul. But only through the saving woe Of Him whose precious blood Supplied the colours of the bow That spans the clouded flood. Ramsgate, Monday Evening, July 30, 1838. A PARTING BENISON TO THE MEDEA STEAMSHIP. Go, sink or swim, thou punt of evil name, And rightly call'd, from Jason's barbarous dame! Lured by thy signal-flag, descried afar, Five home-bound English cross'd Oporto's Bar; Rude winds they heard, and rampant waves they met, But found thy bluff Commander rougher yet. They ask'd admission at that vessel's side: “The mail! the mail!” the imperious Triton cried. “We seek a passage to our native shore!” “Hand up the mail!” he answer'd with a roar. “But here are passengers—a female one—” “The mail I want,” responded Neptune's son. “There take the mail!” (the devil take your manners, And Fate embark us under gentler banners!) “Thanks, very sorry! now shove off!” he cried! “Shove off!” and left us on the weltering tide! For this, thou vapouring punt of evil name, We wish thee—a good voyage all the same! San João da Foz, Oporto, September, 1837. CLOUDS. LINES SENT TO A FRIEND, AFTER WATCHING WITH HER ONE SUMMER'S EVENING THE PASSAGE OF CLOUDS AT DIFFERENT ALTITUDES SUCH AS ARE HERE DESCRIBED. Fair is Earth, a goodly substance—fair with things of every hue; But yon vapour-world is fairer, haunting the cerulean blue. First the rain-clouds float above me, slow, like caravels of freight; Higher are the central sailers; then the cirri, higher yet. These are eastward slowly wending; o'er her grave their shadows pass, While, in rapid retrocession, westward flies the central mass. The passage of clouds at different altitudes in different and even opposite directions, swayed by different currents of air, is quite a common, if not commonly observed, characteristic of them; but I ought not to say it is not commonly observed, for every seaman, and every shepherd, and every other habitual sky-gazer, must be familiar with it. The three several fleets of clouds yesterday sailed just as I have described them. The chapter on clouds in Mr. Ruskin's “Modern Painters” probably suggested something of the above. But the highest and the brightest, linger in their stately march: These are they that bear the Angels, near the zenith of the arch; And among them, poised or wafted, sit the Spirits of the Blest, Looking down on us, the mourners, of their presence dispossest. Oh for wings, that I might seek Her! Something whispers She is there,— Yonder, up among the brightest of those floating isles of air. Grasmere Church-yard, 1848. ON A PORTRAIT BY COMERFORD. Unjust to Nature, though not all untrue, A skilful hand these cherish'd features drew; The general lines with faithful touch it gave, And so secured some triumph o'er the grave. But with the lineaments of age, to trace The fine expression of benignant grace, And yet to mingle with the charm serene The venerable dignity of mien,— Impart the loftiness, yet not impair The courtly softness by the regal air; To give the eye the temper'd light that spread A sort of glory round the reverend head;— This was beyond the artist; all it could His pencil furnish'd; and the work is good. But memory's power a better likeness gives; She still by that among her offspring lives; Regret recals her, till her form appears— Seen through the pensive mist of filial tears— Such as she was ere life's last flame declined, Cloudless of brow, and passionless of mind! Such as she was when kindred seraphs came, Her gentle spirit for the skies to claim. THE MAGDALEN. Paint me a Magdalen With violets in her hair, Such as she gave her Lover Near his aching heart to wear— On that frail Lover's bosom As she had fared, to fare; To love him and to lose him When crush'd and wither'd there.— Just when to heaven upturning Her dark eyes bright with tears, She bade farewell for ever To passion's hopes and fears;— To all the mortal yearning That woman's bosom sears, And scores her heart with burning Whose traces last for years:— Just in that awful struggle, Which fiends and angels share, When sorrow saves the victim Of passion from despair, Paint me that Magdalen Redeem'd—but let her wear A wreath of dark-blue violets About her jet-black hair. “WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN IN WICKLOW?” All that the heart has ever charm'd or awed; Scenes for Salvator; landscapes fit for Claude; Banditti's glens; monks' temples; hermits' cells; Lone streams where nuns might bathe; and lovers' dells; Tall hills whose swelling bosoms heave with woods; And rocks with their rude children, the fresh floods, Plunging and leaping from their parents' arms— These have I seen—with all the added charms Of tint and shade that Autumn could impart To captivate the eye, and fix the heart.— [SONNETS.] TO C. S. H. Glide, spirit benign—for such our guest has been, In presence with us for too brief a tide— Back to thy sadden'd home that claims thee, glide!— A lingering vision of that tranquil mien Inform'd with virtue shrinking from display, A dim reflection of that soul serene, Although the visitant be far away Will yet be ours amid this Eden scene. The whitest cloud that ever light refined Above us floating where the angels hide, Sheds a dark shadow on the mountain-side: So the bland image of thy stainless mind From far will reach us, dear to memory's sight, A pensive shadow of angelic light. Rydal, October 12, 1849. EMMA. How like a soul on her chaste way to heaven The moon is climbing up yon azure hill! Clouds by rude gusts athwart her path are driven, Then pass away, and leave her spotless still: Thus o'er the good pass clouds of worldly ill! Soft, serious Emma! like that moon wert Thou! Lovely in youth and goodness as thou wert; Religion's lambent light was on thy brow, And on thy cheek, and in thy gentle heart, Shedding mild lustre on thy heavenward way, Spite of those earthly clouds that cross'd its ray. Virtue in thee refined upon her part, And seem'd to buoy thee upward, free from taint: Serene Enthusiast! meekly soaring saint! THE AMERICAN SHIP PAULINA. The sinking moon, her herald to the west, At midnight left her motionless in port: Day is but two hours old, and round her sport The Atlantic billows, welcoming their guest Whose red-striped flag is by the breeze carest. Home from the vine-land for her far-off mart, She bears the bacchant juice that cheers the heart, And sometimes maddens. For an exile's breast— For him whom she is wafting far away From Douro's banks, where all his fancies grew, That now must wither in ungenial air— Where is the flattering balm that can allay The yearning of a heart in vain so true, At sea upon a voyage of despair? Foz, near Oporto, Sunday, July 13, 1845. HERO-WORSHIP. I. “Cromwell! our chief of men;” thy surest praise Is this, that He, a greater far than thou, Crown'd with immortal verse thine iron brow. O “fallen on evil tongues and evil days,” And blind already in the horrent blaze Thy torch enkindled, he who could endow Thy blood-red star with seraph light, and vow Upon an idol shrine his sacred bays.— Though none denies thee grandeur in thy crime, That struck the realm as with a thunder shock, Though Milton's organ peal'd applause sublime, That trunkless visage haunts thee from the block, Nor unrebuked will evil fame rejoice, While honour in the island hath a voice. HERO-WORSHIP. II. Discrown'd misfortune trampled in the dust; Admired disorder canting in the phrase Of holiness; a Stuart (for after days A lesson how a King Louis XVI. benignly just, Weak to resist though faithful to his trust, Should perish) murder'd in the public gaze! Creeds topsy-turvy, statutes in a blaze, And all to deify a will robust! Tongue-saintly Cromwell in his stalwart clutch Seizes the sceptre, knocks the gilding off, And makes it homely as a grandam's crutch: But woe to the malignants if they scoff At him who wields it; Oliver, the Man! Save us from Lord-Protectors Puritan! MEDUSA. I. There is a pensive sweetness on her cheek, And in her eye a melancholy lustre, Complaining of the living snakes that cluster Among her golden tresses. How, to wreak Such vengeance on the lovely and the weak, Could the Parthenian Goddess, for her shrine Profaned, forget that mercy was divine? Fair victim! I know one as fair as thou, Whose foot, like thine, at Wisdom's altar stumbled, And who, forsaken and forgotten now, In spirit broken, as in beauty humbled, Feels shame's keen vipers on her aching brow, While they whose ears are shut to misery's groan, View the poor wretch with eyes and hearts of stone! MEDUSA. II. Beautiful Maniac of the locks enchanted, Whose golden net enslaved the Lord of Ocean! Is this the end of all his false devotion? Is this the crown upon thy temples planted By him whose bosom for thy beauty panted? Alas! frail Woman yields to soft emotion, And love beguiles her with some airy notion: And then the tempter's fatal suit is granted; And then, away are wing'd the days of gladness With him who sipp'd the nectar of her breath; And then succeed the pains of guilt and sadness: Love's flowery braid becomes a snaky wreath, And then the serpents hiss her into madness: Thus pleasure's garland turns a crown of death! THE GAULS AT ROME. A.D. 1849. I. License for Gaul, and Liberty for Rome! The Frank Republic on its banner waves, And marches forth to tell the Pontiff's slaves That new-born Freedom shall not find a home Within the precincts of St. Peter's dome, Until in blood baptised, with Gallic knaves For sponsors: such the rite their glory craves. Egregious warning for all time to come— The faith of Paris! Romans, ye have heard The Chanticleer of France outcrow the bird That smote on Peter's heart when he denied His Master. Lo! the Gaul is at the gate; Go forth, but weep not, duped Triumvirate, Embrace your friend, philosopher, and guide! THE GAULS AT ROME. A.D. 1849. II. What! in the breach, amid the roar of guns, Ye meet him hand to hand in deadly strife? The heart of ancient Rome is come to life; The Eternal City owns you for her sons, And Tiber, flush'd with angry triumph, runs Incarnadined with patriot gore, and rife With airs of death; while “war unto the knife,” As in Saguntum, maid nor matron shuns To echo and re-echo from his banks. Mazzini, Saffi, Garibaldi, now, Stand ye or fall, enroll'd in valour's ranks Ye live! Who love ye least will most avow Your Curtian spirit, dreadless of the Gulf— The Roman courage nurtured by the Wolf. Written and published in the “Morning Post,” before the Surrender. THE GAULS AT ROME. A.D. 1849. III. The battle, though not always to the strong, Was too unequal: Rome submits to Gaul; The great republic hath disarm'd the small, And, by that unimaginable wrong, Confess'd itself a bubble, that ere long Should burst by its own lightness. If the fall Of men whose frantic minds the wise appal, Be just, by Gallic hands, let choral song Ring wide for Papal royalty restored. That song, in France, should echo to recal The long-descended heir of him whose sword The pontiff-throne establish'd. From the thrall Released of blind delirium, France again Should hail the regal lily of the Seine. THE GAULS AT ROME. A.D. 1849. IV. Up with the Oriflamme, most Christian France! That long-lost title wouldst thou yet regain, Up with the golden wand of Charlemagne, The banner of Saint Louis, and the lance That, like the seraph's, glitter'd in advance Of sacred armies on the Syrian plain, When Paladins were champions of the Fane, And Christian chivalry was true romance. If this thy new crusade in Holy Land, Be genuine zeal for desecrated law, Look for its cause at home: for there is spawn'd The speckled pest whose breath the nations draw; That glozing cheat at dreaming Freedom's ear, Would start a fiend, touch'd by Ithuriel's spear. FIELD-FOOT CEDAR. I. PLANTED BY WORDSWORTH, SEPTEMBER 18, 1849. Muse-favoured Scion, flourish like thy peers The solemn growth of orient peaks sublime, And trust thy glorious destiny to Time: For, though thy lot may lowlier seem than theirs, The man who plants thee, one of Nature's seers, Above their height has built enduring rhyme. Among these rocks thou canst not choose but climb And prosper, hallowed by his fourscore years. Man's life, extended to its utmost length, Is shorter than the crescent youth of trees; Not so the life of genius, by the strength Of virtue cherished in the sun and breeze. When thou art old, his name will cling to thee, And awe the spoiler,—thou art Wordsworth's Tree! FIELD-FOOT CEDAR. II. Not Menalus, Menalus, famous in classical lore for its pine-trees, and as the favourite haunt of Pan, and his company of Nymphs and Fauns. with all his sylvan throng, Waving applausive to the reed of Pan While nymphal feet the dancing measure scan,— Nor Val di Noto, though its forests rung With Doric harmonies ere Maro sung, The Greek Poet was born in Syracuse, which is in the Val di Noto.— Not Monte Mario, though the Pine See Wordsworth's Sonnet:— “I saw far off the dark top of a Pine,” and the note to it. be there That owes its menaced life to Beaumont's care, Its glory to the Lute by Wordsworth strung,— Outcharms these wild wood-rocks to Fancy's eye, While she beholds this Himalayan plant A stately cedar, potent to enchant Beneath its umbrage, in a future age, Some Poet destined to a mission high, A Weird successor of the Rydal Sage. FIELD-FOOT CEDAR. III. On Indus' banks and Ganges,' near the fane Wherein sits Deva on his mystic throne, The Brahmin sows the Deodarean cone; The Pinus Deodara, the Cedar of India, is held as “a sacred tree by the natives, deodara meaning the tree of Siva or Deva, who is one of the most important divinities in the Hindû Mythology. As the tree of the Gods, the deodara is planted near the Indian temples, and comes in for a share of the worship.” And crouching myriads—for whose sires, in vain A warning voice proclaim'd Messiah's reign, Frances Xavier, Missionary of the East in 1547, was popularly styled “the Apostle of India.” Hereditary thralls to stock and stone— Revere their God-tree in the seed thus sown. Grow thou, secure from ministry insane.— An English river near a purer shrine, Flows by the rocks that will protect thy youth, And thou art planted here but to record A date that cleaves to sympathies benign In hearts that trust the promise of the Word, And rest their solace on Eternal Truth. FIELD-FOOT. I. As laid out by the owner, William Crewdson, Esq. The crags of Loughrigg to the rising sun Oppose a jealous aspect: and his beam (From Wansfell glancing o'er the charmèd stream Of Rotha grateful for the glory won From orient light) those sullen barriers shun, Forbidding with a sylvan veil the gleam That would awaken from their morning dream The cavern'd Oreads, who disporting run Among those cliffs till dawn, and weary then Hide in their fern-screen'd coverts.—Footing there To sprites of Fancy only, not to men, Is free—So deems the pilgrim, unaware How powers severe to strenuous art relent, And passes, seeking a less coy ascent. FIELD-FOOT. II. A human instinct, breathed into the soul By Him who out of chaos Eden made, Has work'd unseen behind yon leafy shade.— The sense of beauty, stealthy as the mole But like the lynx keen-vision'd, upward stole Along the frowning walls, and there essay'd The more than wizard power of axe and spade, To lift the aspirant to a lofty goal. The bird-like spirit of hope from bough to bough, From rock to rock, incited labour on: Reluctant nature smooth'd her angry brow, For not a line of savage grace was gone, From lowly Field-foot to the crowning Fell; So shrewdly work'd the Master of the Spell! Rydal, July 18, 1849. CAVE OF MEDITATION, FIELD-FOOT. A man, whose sorrows veil'd him from the crowd, Wandering incautious of a tempest near, At nightfall chanced to seek a shelter here, And stood and listen'd from this stony shroud To spectral voices hailing him aloud, To woods and waters thundering in his ear, While all was hidden but one eastern star Serenely shining through a riven cloud. Anon the placid star assumed the form Of Her whom he had follow'd to the grave: The momentary vision, poised in air, Glanced with a pity that rebuked despair; Then all the brightness vanish'd in the storm, And Sibyl Night mused with him in the cave. TO ANGUS FLETCHER. Angus, this fond Memorial, that we raise To One all worthy of the sculptor's art, Is but a simple tribute of the heart; No costly lure to take the stranger's gaze. Yet, if some mourner, through the tender haze Of tears, contemplating this modest stone, By sympathetic grief shall soothe his own, Be his the solace, and be thine the praise. The frame of ivy, faithful to the dead, The Cross, the Lamb that watches o'er her grave, The words of life “Him that cometh to Me I will in no wise cast out.” St. John, vi. 37. that to the dying gave The peace of faith upon an anguish'd bed, This love, this mystery, this hope, are there, Evolved, yet guarded, by thy sentient care. Grasmere Church-yard, September 22, 1849. SUSPIRIA. I. WORDSWORTH'S HOME. The fairest bowers in this enchanted land, To me are darken'd by a fate severe, And most yon terraced bower of Rydal-mere, That long-loved mount, where oft some pilgrim band, Won by the genius of the place, will stand Lingering, as now, in many a distant year. Alas! the Delphic “laurels never sere,” Undying trophies of their planter's hand, To Him were blighted, though they yet be green, For me were wither'd, when no more was seen The light that fed her aged father's heart, And shed the tenderest glory on his fame. The living forms of his creative art For us are shadowy,—Dora but a name. August, 1849. II. HER HOME. Oh for a glance into the world above! Enfranchised trembler, thou art surely there! Not mine the gloom fanatic to despair Of grace for thee: but, reft of thy pure love, So dread a conflict in my soul I prove, So lost I feel in solitary care, So frail, forlorn, and worthless, that I dare Aspire to no such height, unless the dove Of peace, descending, teach my hope to soar. Fond heart! thy wounds were heal'd, thy sins forgiven; I saw thee die; I know that thou art blest. Thou, dying sufferer, wert wing'd for heaven; And when thy spirit mounted to its rest My guardian angel fled, to come no more. III. “JESUS WEPT.” (St. John xi. 35.) Christ, Thou hast wept! Forgive the tears I shed; I know Thou wilt upraise her. But I fear This captious questioner within. The tear That falls so oft upon her grave is bred Of doubt and horror. When her Spirit fled 'Twas sanctified in Thee: but I am here, On this bleak earth, a lorn probationer, Struggling against myself—She is not dead, But sleepeth:—shall I ever see her more, Or see her as she was, the soul, the life, Of my life's being? I shall sleep and wake, But will the waking unto me restore, Or find me doom'd for ever to forsake, The glorified immortal, once my Wife? Wednesday, August 22, 1849. IV. A REQUEST. Two graves, in Grasmere Vale, yew-shaded both, My all of life, if life be love, comprise. In one the mother of my children lies, Fate's blameless victim in her bloom of youth: The other holds the constancy and truth That never fail'd me under darker skies, When subtle wrongs perplex'd me. Her whose eyes Saw light through every wildering maze uncouth. Between those graves a space remains for me: O lay me there, wherever I may be When met by Death's pale angel; so in peace My dust near theirs may slumber, till the day Of final retribution or release For mortal life's reanimated clay. STANZAS [Deem not the Bard ungentle of his kind] Written at Oporto, January, 1837, and addressed to the sister of Lieut. Robert Cockburn, of the Royal Artillery, who perished in the “Tigris” steamer, which sank in a hurricane on the Euphrates, a little below Annah, on the 21st of May, 1836. Deem not the Bard ungentle of his kind, Though due so long his promised tribute be, Pure pearls of fancy are but hard to find, And meaner gems are all unworthy Thee.— Fain would I summon now the Muse of glee To chant the pæan of the new-born year, And give thee greeting: but, believe the plea,— No Muse of joy will answer to my cheer, Though Thou art one of those to Fancy's Daughters dear. I see a youthful Hebe-matron, clad In raiment sacred to a stern distress, And thoughts, that would be gay, perforce are sad, To see her cheek, too, wear the mourner's dress, The shade of sorrow, deepening loveliness; The pensive trace of anguish that has past, But with it taken from her life no less Than youth's fond hope that ev'n on earth might last Serene delights for them whose hopes on Heaven are cast. Lady of Albyn, never northern flower, Transplanted to a garden of the sun, Found in the fervent south a fairer bower Than Chance for Thee, by Taste directed, won, Where Douro's waters near the ocean run; There, rich in pleasures that the good esteem, And far from revels that the happiest shun, Thy lot, young wife and mother, well might seem A proof that earthly joys were not indeed a dream. Yet might thy distant home at times intrude Its dearer image on the sunnier land; Thy soul might hearken, in some anxious mood, To well-known voices from a Scottish strand, Though borne on softer gales than ever fann'd The cheek of beauty on thy native shore:— Then would thy spirit yearn till fancy's wand Restored thee to that household hearth once more, With all thy kinsmen there to greet thee as of yore. Perhaps among them, thy return to hail, A soldier stood embrown'd by torrid skies, Safe from the ocean-storm, the desert-gale, The breaker's menace, and the shoal's surprise; Safe from the savage foe in friendly guise, The dank miasma, the sirocco's breath, And every chance that lurks with evil eyes To waste adventurous Errantry beneath Its subtle glance malign, and mock his toils with death. Perhaps that very month, that very day Such home-wing'd thoughts from yon “Mirante” Mirante, a look-out tower fitted up as a garden summer-house, over-looking the river Douro. flew, That very noon—while rich delicious May Shower'd orange-odours on thy head, and threw About thy feet bright buds of every hue:— Heedless that Spring's aroma round thee breathed, Perhaps even then, thy mind the portrait drew Of one with visionary laurels wreath'd— Alas, the soldier's sword for evermore was sheath'd! Him (by those shores where Judah's captive daughters On Babel's willows hung their harps and wept), Him, even then, embark'd on fatal waters, Down to their depths the Syrian vortex swept.— Their gliding course two ships of Britain kept, The iron steamers the “Euphrates” and “Tigris,” sent out by Government with the expedition under Colonel Chesney, R. A., to ascertain the possibility of navigating the Euphrates river as a short route to India. Bound on a desert-pilgrimage to Ind! Fraught with a Band whose brave impatience stept To strait conclusions; with the island-mind That spurns its billowy chain, and marches unconfined. No more round scowling Afric's stormy Cape, Where Lusian Vasco led the Hope forlorn, Need western messengers remotely shape Their track to reach the birth-land of the Morn,— For lo! a Power in the west is born That, wingless, mocks the flight of winged ships, And laughing old impediments to scorn, Right to the goal, as Arab courser leaps, Fleets o'er the iron lines, or steams along the deeps. That giant-child of science, cradled on Britannia's waves, the Band of Britons take To grapple with the flood of Babylon; At Bir, The two iron steamers the “Euphrates” and the “Tigris” were launched at Bir. their Infant-Hercules they wake To try his prowess on the Desert Snake. “Desert Snake,” so called from the winding course of the river.— The dusky Bedouin, near his swarthier tent, Saw vessels strange with stranger flag opaque Of streaming vapour, lengthen'd as they went, And watch'd the breathing omen, wondering what it meant; Or horde of Arabs group'd beneath the shade Of clustering date-trees, gazed with jealous ire; Lords of the parchèd wastes, they saw, dismay'd, Intruders leagued with their own flood and fire; Their founts of naphtha with their streams conspire To serve the white magicians from the West, Who came, with charms and occult courses dire, To force the burning wilds, perhaps to wrest Their sway, in nature's right, by Ismael's sons possest. Brave minds, at war with Time and Space they think They now have made that River proud their slave, Have made Euphrates the bimarian link Of Persia's gulf and the Levantine wave! But, when the current friendliest promise gave He kept barbaric faith with his allies: He bade them welcome, and prepared their grave,— While they, rejoicing in their hard emprise, Assured fruition saw with Valour's trusting eyes. 'Twas noon: the sun from his meridian quiver, Pelted the waves with arrows, in his play; The shallow ships, adown the olden river, Skimm'd o'er Is Geria's reef their earnest way:— At once, a rushing Midnight blacken'd Day! Midnight! in sweltering sandy mantle clad, Borne on the wings of winds that scented prey, And storm'd the waters with their barkings glad: The panting River heaved, and reel'd with joyance mad. Blind Passion works its furious purpose fast; 'Twas but a transient fit of Nature's spleen; Almost ere one could cry “it comes,” 'twas past,— Light look'd again on that unalter'd scene; The brushwood-banks of Annah were as green, The sylvan isles as graceful as before; The Babylonish River was serene As if one hapless ship it lately bore Lay not, a wreck ensnared, beneath its treacherous floor; As if its Arab gripe did never clutch, And crush stout hearts within its fierce embrace; Nor held, that moment, in its grasp so much Of worth and daring that had toil'd to grace A ruggèd enterprise, and earn a place On Honour's lists.—They wrote their names in sand; They penn'd their glory with a watery trace; They reap'd the whirlwind, where they sought the bland Rewards of ripe success for projects nobly plann'd. And Thou—that gentle breast was sore assail'd, When from thy vision of the bright May-morn The flattering mist that soothed suspense exhaled, And Hope, so oft to human love forsworn, Show'd, through her orient veil abruptly torn, The dull perspective of Ambition crost, Of frustrate skill, of courage overborne; And, in the midst of all, a Brother's ghost— A Brother doubly dear because for ever lost. No, not for ever! to thy constant faith That hope at least in saintly trust is given; For, those who tread like Thee the narrow path, The arduous line of light that leads to Heaven, With hopeless sorrow never yet have striven, Nor known the heart's immedicable pain.— O lady, if by mournful fancies driven My verse has pierced a recent wound again, Forgive the rash misdeed, forget the offending strain: But no—the trembling sympathies that waken Such strains, were never ministers of wrong: To soothe the spirit though the heart be shaken Is the emollient privilege of song: Not with the griefs that all to pain belong The mourner sits beneath the cypress tree Whereon the melancholy lyre is hung That turns to sighs the breeze's minstrelsy: When tears to music flow their fall is anguish-free: And thou hast listen'd to this verse of mine, Although its melody in sooth be rude, Not with the fever'd feelings that repine At sorrow's violated solitude. Thou still wouldst listen, if the theme pursued Thy lonely kinsman, from his watery lair Uplifted, (for the wave in milder mood Resign'd its victim,) and by Christian care Committed dust to dust—no kindred witness there; No Sire at hand; no Mother (half whose heart Was yet there buried with her gallant boy); Nor Brother, nor the Sister-counterpart Of all his gentler qualities, stood nigh. Nor, haply, ever shall a kinsman sigh Over his sand-swathed reliques, far removed From native scenes, from every social tie Of Childhood, every haunt where first he proved The blessèd charm of life, to love and be beloved. A stone, 'twas all they could, his comrades rear'd To mark his grave—Oblivion's desert shower Will quench the dim memorial: but the endear'd By worth ev'n in the grave retain a power Tenacious over memory. The hour Of doom, the fondliest-cherish'd blossom reaves, But they who knew the sweetness of the flower Store in their breasts the crush'd and wither'd leaves, Whose root in earth is hid, whose essence Heaven receives. TO D?. Friend of my heart!—for thus my heart Has named its dearest earthly friend— Though distant far we dwell apart, True minds can still in absence blend. Where'er I wander on the earth, I know that thou wilt think of me; While every scene shall call to birth Some fond and touching thought of thee. I ne'er shall climb a mountain's side, Nor steer across a glistening lake, Nor through romantic woodlands ride, Nor roam where billows wildly break; But memory still within my breast To soft regret will heave a sigh; For every scene will still suggest Some dearer scene where thou wert nigh. TO D. H. Blithe bird of the wood-nook, thy flight we deplore; Fair flower of the Green Bank, we see thee no more; Mild star of the moor-land, where now is thy gleam That so softly gave light to the lake and the stream? If a bird be thine emblem, a passage-bird thou; Those warblers of summer, where carol they now? They were friends of the summer, from winter they flee, And the sweet wingèd sylvans have vanish'd like thee. If a star be thy symbol, yon star in the west, That peeps in at my casement, resembles thee best: It haunts me, it sends me a light like a smile, Yet is distant, alas! and is setting the while. If a flower be thy type (but where now are the flowers? Not a bud, scarce a leaf, cheers this winter of ours) If a flower be thy type, 'tis the simplest, the dearest, The bright little primrose, whose advent is nearest: That flower will I call thee, the herald of spring; 'Twill announce thy return, and the season will bring. No rose in all England, no lily of France, Or in summer or spring against thee has a chance: Such a primrose is worth all the tulips of Holland— How I envy and hate longitudinal Bolland. TO MRS. HARRISON, OF THE SHRUBBERY, BARHAM. The lark salutes thy May-day morn From yonder fleecy cloud, The blackbird from the dewy thorn His welcome pipes aloud. So we in early strains unite To greet thy natal day— Without the lark's ethereal flight, Or blackbird's music gay. But not without the songster's glee, That in thy “shrubbery” sings, And not without the prayer for thee That lark-like heavenward springs. And with us in accordance sweet Thy children's children pray That we may all together meet In an eternal May. May-day, 1839. TO A YOUNG LADY, WHO RESIDED BETWEEN THE RIVERS LEE AND BRIDE, NEAR CORK. A river by thy bower is flowing, Lady of the Lee! Tell me, maiden, is he going Lonely to the sea? Lovely lady, not alone, For soon the Bride will be his own. Below thy sire's abode, behold, The gentle Bride has join'd the Lee, Till now alone, and pure, and cold, The Bride was but a type of thee: Lovely lady, who is he Whose symbol is the wedded Lee? For him life's stream will fairly glide! And joy be his, whoe'er he be! So farewell now the Lee and Bride, Whose flowery banks are not for me: Banks there are as fair to see, But where's the nymph like her of Lee? LINES TO MRS. DUNLOP, FOR ROTHA. O could I lay as fair a chain Upon that neck of thine As thou, to make my birthday vain, This morn hast laid on mine, Sweet lady, nor of gold nor pearl My fairy gift should be; The feeble fancy of a girl Should prove too strong for thee. And wert thou e'er so far away, My chain should hold thee still, A charm upon thy spirit lay, Thy memory and thy will: A charm to make thee, when we part, Full oft of her to think Who would have bound thee to her heart With love in every link. The Foz, near Oporto, September 15, 1845. TO MISS ?. Thou wert to me a mystery of not unpleasing dread; Thou art to me a history that I have quickly read! There is a spell upon thee which I would not read aloud, To any but thy secret ear within an arbour's shroud. For though it might be quickly said, thy cheek would change its hue If 'twere exprest by more than one, or heard by more than two. It is not guilt, it is not shame; tho' leading oft to both In breasts where sensibility is prodigal of growth. Thou art not happy, though thy smile would fain the truth deny; I know too much of sorrow's guile to trust a laughing eye: Thine is a genuine woman's heart; all woman to the core; Beware; be warn'd before we part! for we shall meet no more. (Though not perchance without a sigh shall memory oft retrace That fine pale air of intellect and melancholy grace.) Farewell, forget me if thou wilt, while pleasures round thee bloom, Remember me when thou art left in solitude and gloom. TO MARY, DANCING. Diana's queenlike step is thine, And when in dance thy feet combine They fall with truth so sweet, The music seems to come from thee, And all the notes appear to be “The echoes of thy feet.” And every limb with all the notes In that accordant beauty floats And careless air of chance, That 'tis a rapture to behold Thee thus, with waving locks of gold, The very soul of dance. The loveliness so rich before Puts on a thousand graces more In that inspiring maze; Like jewels brighter when in motion, Or sunshine on the waves of ocean, Alive with dancing rays. MAY LUTTRELL. A Christmas Day on Biscay's Bay Is sorry cheer, May Luttrell! A roaring breeze and raging seas Are music drear, May Luttrell! Our moaning bark like Noah's ark Is all alone, May Luttrell! The waste of surge to Ocean's verge Seems all our own, May Luttrell! Skies, sea, and wind were fair and kind But yesterday, May Luttrell! But now astray they force our way On Biscay's Bay, May Luttrell! The sea and wind are like thy mind, A fickle pair, May Luttrell! The changing skies are like thine eyes, So false and fair, May Luttrell! Within Oporto's orange shades And citron bowers, May Luttrell, Are maids of beauty dark, and maids As fair as flowers, May Luttrell! And one there is above them all With charms endow'd, May Luttrell! A maiden dark and pale and tall, Of spirit proud, May Luttrell! Her eyes are as the lightning bright In arrowy freaks, May Luttrell! Enkindling blushes with their light On her own cheeks, May Luttrell! And then the magic of her smile, That smile of smiles, May Luttrell! Which still invites and still delights And still beguiles, May Luttrell! Though far away from sunny shores And sunnier eyes, May Luttrell! I toss where angry ocean roars To blackening skies, May Luttrell! That stately form, with all its warm Array of grace, May Luttrell! Before me glitters through the storm! I see her face, May Luttrell! But mark, the gale has ceased to rail; The wind has veer'd, May Luttrell! Our bark so gay now knows her way, Northeastward steer'd, May Luttrell! I fill the glass, a health to pass Though far at sea, May Luttrell! A health to Porto's fairest lass;— And that's to Thee, May Luttrell! TO A LADY OF SUPERCILIOUS AIR. Why should thine eyes look daggers? sheathe Their pride within those silken lids; And listen, lady, while I breathe The tale thy haughty stare forbids. Is it a tale of love? why how Those orbs dilate with wondering scorn! No, think to hear no lover's vow, Proud daughter of the “son of morn!” 'Tis true while I regard that brow My deepest feelings trembling wake; Like leaves upon the aspen bough They seem without a cause to shake. But thou art less than half the cause, So toss not thus the head superb; Although thy form my memory awes, Although thy traits my dreams disturb. I watch thy course in fashion's train, Where most thy gaudy beauty flares; And hate thy spirit cold and vain, But love too well the form it wears. Thou art to me as if the Dead Had shaken off her mortal trance, And glided round my board and bed With icy, strange, mysterious glance. As if, unchanged in shape, she came From out her dormitory damp, But with the mind's informing flame Rekindled at another's lamp. Thou wilt die young, perchance, like her Whose breathing effigy thou art; Death's angel may delight to mar The beauty that deforms thy heart. No: not o'er thee will early wave The shadow of that angel's wings; The hearts which find the earliest grave Are those that feeling deepest stings. No, live, till by the crooked share Of time, thy brow and cheek are plough'd, And, scant and gray, thy feeble hair Thy palsied head shall faintly shroud. Alas, if I misjudge thee!—soul And feature often disagree; Beneath the ice that guards the pole Unnumber'd living things there be. Unnumber'd germs of loveliest flowers Lie slumbering under winter snows, Awaiting vernal sun and showers To rouse them from their drear repose. Like birds that nestle among leaves Of thistle, holly-tree, and thorn, There's many a heart that warmly heaves Within its prickly hedge of scorn. LADIES' EYES. TO MISS ?. The common song of “Ladies' Eyes” Is not the song for me; And flattery is too coarse a prize To be received by thee. Then shade not thine with anger's cloud, Although a friend complain Of eyes that captivate the proud, And persecute the vain. False tongues have ruin'd many a heart, False eyes have ruin'd more; Thine eyes are false, and full of art, The modern lady's lore. Forgive me, if I rudely preach; But thou art fair and young, And few will beauty's eyes impeach With truth's impartial tongue. A generous spirit like to thine Should scorn the juggler's play, That teaches ladies' eyes to shine, To flatter, and betray. If only fools and fops were stung By that hyblean smile, I scarce could grudge thee, fair and young, The triumph of thy guile. The victims of their own conceit May serve a lady's mirth; But there are hearts that warmly beat On this unfeeling earth. Such, by delusive kindness caught, To looks confide their peace; And, when they find their hopes were nought But trophies for caprice, They will not let thee hear them sigh. Nor let thee see them weep; They will not sue, for pride is high Where tenderness is deep. They will not wear the lover's chain Exposed upon their breast; Nor make a spectacle of pain That thou and thine may jest. Nor will they dreary woods explore, Nor pace in lonely halls; Nor linger on the river shore, To gaze upon thy walls. But they will join the social walk, And fare as others fare; And thus thy pride of conquest balk, By their contented air. But not the less, oh not the less, Though well they act their part, May be the patient mind's distress, The blight upon the heart. Remember then, for true love's sake, False looks are worse than words; And play no more the bright-eyed snake That fascinates the birds. TO THE POET. I Wordsworth, the nightingales are come! They love the pleasant groves of Lee; 'Tis budding, billing, singing weather; “Birds of a feather Flock together.” And where they are 'tis fit that you should be. II Poet, the nightingales are come! Their throats are now in perfect tune; Yet you are gone away, Though after May These vernal melodies are almost dumb; And seldom shall we hear in June These shy, inconstant, poets of the moon. III Though passing fair is Rydal-mere, Nor Rotha's groves in music fail: They only boast throughout the year One solitary nightingale. IV Wordsworth is that dainty bird; But scores of nightingales are heard Among the pleasant groves of Lee: And where they are, 'tis fit that he should be; Yet he is gone away Upon the very day They flock to greet the bard, and welcome in the May. Lee Priory, April 30, 1824. LEE PRIORY, IN MAY. WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF R. Q. When squirrels dance, and humble-bees Come murmuring out of hollow trees To rifle primrose flowers; When cuckoos come o'er southern seas, And with them bring the genial breeze, That wakes the drowsy hours— When colts are frisking in the glade, Lambs racing in the light and shade, On green and woody slopes, Where daisies, violets, spread their treasures, As pure, as rich, as children's pleasures, As lively as their hopes— Then is the seasonable time, When all things sweet are in their prime, To ramble and to see Fair sights and hear delightful sounds, Where every woodland charm abounds, Among the groves of Lee. Then tender leaves on tree and bush, Scarce hide the blackbird and the thrush, The linnets green and brown, The wren, and every shyest bird Whose madrigals from morn are heard, Until the sun goes down. Then that fond bird, the sylvan dove, Whose name and nature chime to love, Sends forth his long low call; And all are sweetly heard in spite Of clouds of rooks, from morn till night, Discordant over all. But when the vernal daylight fails, Then is the time for nightingales, The air is all their own— Save when the gray-owl shrilly sends His shout abroad, or sheep-bell blends A soothing pastoral tone; Save when the distant Minster clock Of Canterbury Cathedral, four miles off. Distinctly breathes with solemn shock The oracles of time, Which sleepless echo loves to mock, While faintly crows the pheasant-cock, Awaken'd by the chime. They who thus in star-lit vales Listen to the nightingales; They may sometimes fairly doubt That far more cunning sprites are out Than ever taught the little throats Of birds to trill melodious notes. They may believe such strains to be The songs of ladies of the Sea, Mermaidens come from Thanet's coves To pass the night in Ickham groves, And stud with pearls the flowering thorn, To please the curious eye of Morn. Lee Priory, May, 1833. CHILD LOST. IN A LADY'S ALBUM. Let prosing souls on earthly steeds To earth their foggy rides confine: Aloft, aloft, where fancy leads, To ride the wingèd horse be mine! He bears me far, from sordid crowds; He leaps the welkin's crystal bars; His pinions cleave the sullen clouds; His hoofs strike sparkles from the stars. Last night alone and unregarded, I canter'd up the milky way, And found heaven's suburbs all placarded— “Child lost. A cherub gone astray! “A flaxen-headed blue-eyed treasure, A rosy minion, round and merry, Who laughs, the very soul of pleasure, And answers to the name of Cherry. “Supposed that a terrestrial dame, Seen lurking near some time ago, Seduced the child, to change its name, And pass it for her own below. “The lady's face was pale and fair, Her wit was lively, keen, and bright; And oft 'tis said to Cynthia's car She climb'd to pilfer rays of light. “Whoever brings to Cherub Square, The small Angelic, shall be paid Ten thousand thanks, in coin of air; No further offer will be made.” Oh ho! said I, if that's the pay Your Cherubim-retrievers earn, Yon urchin where it is may stay, And bloom on earth as Marion Burn. WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF EDITH MAY SOUTHEY, WHO FORBADE COMPLIMENT. Art thou a creature to enchant, Exquisitely elegant, And delicately fair! Form'd in the spirit of the plan Of nature, when she made a swan, A lily, and a star! Is thine that union undefined, Of harmony, of form, and mind, Whose type was Beauty's zone? The voice and smile that charm together; Like sun and breeze in vernal weather At play with flowers new blown? Hast thou the glory of a name, Familiar to melodious fame, And dear to Fancy's lyre? Do streams and birds from rock and brake Proclaim thee nymph of Derwent Lake, In honour of thy sire? And must I on this page of thine, Without one laudatory line, Poetic tribute pay? Well—thou art not to be denied, Though Skiddaw frown, though Greta chide, Sweet Edith, I obey. IN A LADY'S ALBUM. Songstress, when at dew-fall, Wandering in May, I shall hear the warblers Singing down the day, While the yellow “May-fly” Hovers o'er the brook, Watching its own shadow With a lover's look; Wheresoe'er it be, Often thus and long, I shall think of thee, And thy grace of song. When in vernal hedge-banks, Under hawthorn trees, “Pansies” archly ask me, Is your heart at ease? Then thy verse remembering, Verse in Music's dress, Verse that scents those flowers, I shall answer—“Yes.” Bird and quivering insect, Flower and “honey-bee,” All shall be memorials Of thy song and thee. IN AN ALBUM. Lady, are you dark or fair, Owner of this pretty book? What's the colour of your hair? Are you blithe and debonnaire, Or demure of look? If your eyes are black as sloes, And your locks of ebon hue; O'er your cheeks if nature throws Only just enough of rose, Why, I think you'll do. If with pretty mouth you sing, Void of all extravaganza, Tender melodies that bring Hearts around you fluttering, You are worth a stanza. If you be in soul a child Lively as a meteor, Yet with a discretion mild, Tempering the spirit wild, You're a charming creature. Rydal Mount, October 28, 1829. IN THE ALBUM OF MARGARET ? Both meanings of La Marguerite, The daisy or the pearl, For once in perfect concord meet, And suit the very girl! Some prophet surely gave that name At the baptismal hour Of one who sparkles like a gem, Though modest as the flower. IN AN ALBUM Given to Miss Bayley (Allan Bank, Grasmere), by “An Old Man, C. W.,” and in which Mr. Wordsworth had written a stanza from his Dedication of the Duddon Sonnets. An old man gave this little book To young and blooming Fanny Bayley; That fancies, brighten'd by her look, Might decorate its pages gaily: An older man, the Wizard Chief Of Rydal's Heliconian Mount, Is first to grace a favour'd leaf With fancies born of Duddon's Fount. But he has quaff'd of Hippocrene; Then who to follow him shall dare, Whose laurels are in age as green As those that deck'd Apollo's hair? I too am old, but never drank The frenzy of that subtle spring; Nor dare to sing for Allan Bank, Where he, when young, was wont to sing; Where every tree, and rock, and hill, Were cheer'd by Wordsworth's voice so long; Where every grove is haunted still With sadden'd echoes of his song. Let youthful bards his footsteps trace, And cull the wreath for maiden brows! Yet why should I refuse to place A sprig thereon from Loughrigg boughs? Such tribute, from December's bowers, I yet may borrow without folly: Though wintry age is bare of flowers, 'Twill yield at least a Christmas holly. Loughrigg Holme, December 26, 1849. SONG.—AMBLESIDE VALE. Air—“The Meeting of the Waters.” There's a vale in the lakeland, a Westmoreland vale, Where a bright river runs the Winander to hail; With a voice from Helvellyn The source of the Rotha is on Helvellyn. it warbles along, But reserves for that valley the pride of its song. As it winds out of Rydal, in mazes it steals To the rock of Fieldfoot, Fieldfoot. Mr. William Crewdson's. that so shyly conceals How the spirit of nature, though ever so wild, By the genius of taste may be led like a child. Flowing on, the bright river sweeps round by the Ghyll, Foxghyll. Mr. Roughsedge's. Where the fairies by moonlight yet wander at will; Then turns to the How, Foxhow. Mrs. Arnold's. Fox is here a corruption from Folk: in north country language the Folk means the fairies; consequently Foxghyll is the fairies' ghyll (or glen). Foxhow is the fairies' how or knoll.—there the rings may be seen Where the feet of the Fairies have danced out the green. Now it takes to its bosom the nymph-haunted brook, That to Lesketh Lesketh. Dr. Davy's. comes down from the wells of the Nook, Loth to leave its green hills, and that exquisite brow Where it brawls through the oaks by the lawns of Scale How. Scale How. Mr. Benson Harrison's. Sweet vale of the Rotha! no beauty like thine! Even sorrow but lends thee a grace more divine; There's a light from the past on thy meadows and streams, And this Garden of Eden is more than it seems! SONG ALTERED FROM MOORE. Come tell me, says Rosa, (and who could resist The wishes by Rosa express'd?) Come tell me the number, repeat me the list, Of those you have loved and caress'd. Oh Rosa! 'twas only my fancy that roved, My heart at the moment was free; But I'll tell thee, my girl, how many I've loved, And the number shall finish with thee. My first love was Chloe, the proud and the coy, Who shrank from the flatterer's tone, But smiled on the innocent love of a boy, Whose heart was as pure as her own. The next was Maria, a beauty and flirt, Who smiled upon twenty and more; We loved and we quarrell'd, and neither was hurt, For the heart was left out of the score. Cassandra, the preacher, is third on the roll, She reign'd for a year and a day; But the dear theologian so puzzled my soul, That at last I ran fairly away. The fourth had a foot for the slipper of glass, An eye all comparison mocking, A shape for an angel of light, but alas, There was always a hole in her stocking. The next was a damsel all trouble and tears, The sibyl of sorrow was she, For ever disturbing the present with fears Of the woes that might possibly be. The flower that would fondly have lived in her smile, She water'd to death with her eyes; The bird that would near her have caroll'd awhile, She frighten'd away with her sighs. Then came Angelina, an angel in name, A mortal in temper was she; Yet her nature was noble, and I was to blame, But in sooth we could never agree. The first was the dream of my childhood: the rest Were visions as fleeting for me; My fancy was vagrant, the heart in my breast, Sweet Rosa, was waiting for thee. LOW WOOD, WINANDERMERE. In such a scene, on such a day, I crown'd my bride the queen of May With wreath by Erin's daughters braided; The hills were grand, the bowers were gay, Roughly bold, and softly shaded; The lake was calm, and bright, and clear, Like the lake of Windermere. Years since have past of joy and pain, I've never heard her voice complain, In sickness and in sadness; In health I've never known her vain, Nor arrogant in gladness. Would that I now her voice could hear By the lake of Windermere. May 1, 1824. MELANCHOLY. There is a kind of soothing sorrow Which vulgar minds can never know; There is a feeling that can borrow Its wildest sweetest thrill from woe. 'Tis felt at that lone hour of night, When sadly smiles the silver orb, When witching gleams of shadowy light The sighs of misery absorb. There is a tear of doubtful birth, By sorrow claim'd yet joy resembling, Though unallied to ruder mirth, 'Tis still 'twixt grief and pleasure trembling. That feeling with its foster tear, Though human earth-worms deem it folly, Is yet to pensive fancy dear, And poets call it Melancholy. NEPTUNE AND MEDUSA. He ask'd the simple nymph to roam, And view his sparry grot so rare, And promised her a coral comb, To bind her long refulgent hair. He lured the nymph of golden locks, To dive beneath the gurgling foam, But told not that the ocean rocks Conceal'd another bride at home. Nor told her of the green sea-snakes, That watch'd about the sparry floor; She knows them now, and never shakes The serpents from her tresses more. STANZAS. IN ALLUSION TO SOME WORLDLY ADVICE IN CLEVER VERSE BY A LADY TO HER YOUNGER FRIEND, THE FOLLOWING WAS WRITTEN:— [Each verse is as acute in wit] Each verse is as acute in wit, Each turn of thought as keenly clever, As if with not a pen 'twas writ But arrow from Apollo's quiver. And yet to me those stanzas shine Like wintry stars whose brilliance freezes, So shrewdly wise each cautious line 'Twould suit a grey logician's thesis. Then, maid, dissolve, (like Egypt's Queen Her pearl,) though more than pearls they glisten, Dissolve those icicles serene, Those gems of hard advice, and listen. I'll offer counsel quite as just Though dull of point and rude in measure; Beware in youth of cold distrust That clogs the springs of sinless pleasure. Suspect not all—if thou art fair,— Of flattery whom thy converse pleases; But yet their praise as lightly bear As flowers the touch of passing breezes. If small thy dower—round Mammon's cave Disdain to watch with lures of beauty; Nor seek to be a glittering slave In golden chains of bridal duty. The fault of Atalanta shun, Who lost the race with sordid leisure; The goal of happiness unwon, Of what avail is senseless treasure? If wealth be thine, with prudent care But not idolatrously keep it: There never yet was spendthrift heir Whom sorrow did not force to weep it. But, being rich, in scale too nice Weigh not thy gold against affection; Earth has no ore of half the price Of love refined by fond reflection. If thou hast mind as well as wealth, When strangers gladly round thee hover, Oh do not then insidious stealth In each admirer's glance discover. Think not the ruling lust of pelf Sets every head in scheming action— Trust that thy mind's magnetic self May have some share in the attraction. O maiden, be reserve thy stay; 'Tis youthful Hope's unfailing anchor: But throw suspicion far away; 'Tis Feeling's bane, and Beauty's canker. TENSES. Past, be thou forgot! Present, vanish fast! Future, thou art not, Would that thou wert past! So in peevish moods, Youth impatient said, Later sorrow broods Thus o'er wiser dread. Past, be thou not dumb! Present, be not deaf! Lest the future come Like a sudden thief. Age, within thy brow, Grave the deeds of youth; So shall then to now Teach severest truth. So shall folly's page Furnish wisdom's text, Youth instructing age Ever when perplext. Sins are memory's thorns, Lay them to thy soul; Every puncture warns Wanderers from the goal: ‘Him who wore their crown, Truant, thou must meet (O beware his frown!) On his judgment seat.’ Present, let the past Therefore be thy tutor; Welcome then the last Trumpet to the future! THE TWO RINGS. One contained hair, which had been set by mistake in a black-bordered ring, with a butterfly enamelled on it—On the other was engraved the Portuguese word Saudade. So, Dora, 'tis thy chance to wear Thy living lover's pledge of hair, Upon a Mourning Ring; Say could the Genius of Despair A darker omen bring? Well, wear it thus in fortune's spite! Perhaps the omen read aright With bland injunction saith, ‘In absence be thy spirit bright, For he is true till death.’ And that Greek emblem, wing'd for flight Through mortal darkness to the light Which gleams afar, above, May hint that even thus his soul From death may rise to thee, its goal, Its beacon light of love. But lest thy courage take alarm, Wear this Ring too, a counter-charm In fancy's drooping hour; An amulet to guard from harm The faith that trusts its power. A simple offering; lady's hand Was ne'er with golden finger-band Of less pretension deck'd; Yet more than wealth of Ophir-land Thy heart will there detect. Blank as the superfice appears, Within, the ripen'd gems of years, Love's diamond quarry, shine; Truth, feeling, memory, hopes and fears,— One word is all the mine. “HIC JACET MALLEUS SCOTORUM.” King Edward held a stately feast For England's peace restored; Unarmèd knight and rosy priest Were jovial at the board. He sate on Scotia's Lia-Fail, The mystic Chair of Fate, Whereon, ere Erin's star grew pale, The crown'd of Cashel sate. The harpstring and the pliant voice Were chiming in accord, And made th' heroic heart rejoice Of England's aged lord. The minstrels sang of Cambria tamed, Her prince, her bards, a dream: (O, how was minstrel honour shamed By that unholy theme!) They sang of Scotland, and the death The traitor Wallace died; The monarch glanced on pale Monteith, And laugh'd out in his pride: They sang of Bruce, a broken reed, Of Scotland's hopes the last, A waif on ocean, or a weed, On Erin's breakers cast: No more the dew of homage fails To Britain's triple throne; No more shall vassals reign in Wales, Nor slaves be crown'd at Scone; King Edward reigns o'er hills and dales Unrivall'd and alone. They sang—but hark, another strain, A cry from Cheviot's warders, “The Scots are up in arms again, From Carrick to the borders.” The barons started to their feet: The King sate fiercely still, Hard-tempering, in the furnace heat Of rage, his iron will. His heel on Scotland's neck to plant, Arising then, he swore; He vowed it by the Saxon saint Whose crown and name he bore. The Liege of Albion by his right, Of Scotia by his wrong— Woe to the weak who dare to plight Their cause against the strong! A hunting-field shall Scotland be! And, like a knightly lord, He comes with England's chivalry To keep his royal word. Through old Carlisle, the merry town Of trouble and turmoil, A city out of chaos grown For border-carls to spoil; Through Carlisle, merry with alarms, What dread procession flows! What force of mounted knights in arms, What press of bills and bows! That very tramp of cavalry Might quail the Lowland thanes, That show alone of archery Dry up the Highland veins. Lo, in advance of targe and lance, King Edward, on a rock, Surveys the north with such a glance As eagle eyes the flock. His look devours the Scottish land, It seems within his clasp; He stretches forth his threatening hand As if the prey to grasp: That hand is grappled suddenly By one who beards his wrath! What madman dares a jest so free? Hush—'tis a greater King than he, The King whose name is Death! Like him who took his lingering stand On Nebo, to explore Gilead, with all the promised land From Napthali to Zoar, But thither came a dying man, His entrance disallow'd: Thus, though no guide his way foreran, No seraph in the cloud— Thus came the haught Plantagenet, To see, but not possess, A land that in his fury yet He doom'd a wilderness. For, ev'n in death, a tyrant brave, He felt his heart enlarge With despot passion, and he gave His son a solemn charge: “When I am dead, if thou would'st thrive, In earth depose me not; Thy father, breathless, as alive, Would yet appal the Scot. With fire and water seethe my corse Until my bones are bare; Then fix me on a gallant horse In front of England's war; My very skeleton shall force The rebels to despair.” That ghastly mandate on the wind Spent its delirious sting; In London's Minster were enshrined The relics of the King. In that grand pile of memories, Whoever seeks the spot May read his epitaph—“Here lies The Hammer of the Scot.” But what of all the dread array The invader led so far? Gone; but, as tempests pass away, To gather fiercer war. The southern wind comes roaring loud, The stormy hosts return! Who now shall brave the thunder-cloud?— The Bruce at Bannockburn. ADDRESS TO A PONY. Climb, pigmy steed! strain up each rocky ledge! Ambition browses on imperial heights; Goodwill and courage are the plumes that fledge Small hippogriffs like thee for daring flights. Dwarfs conquer giants by their strength of heart; If thou art emulous of like renown, Climb, Pony, climb! achieve a glorious part, And plant thy hoof on proud Helvellyn's crown. Almost as light a freight is thine to-day As thou art wont to bear on many a hill, Although for once 'tis not thine own blithe Fay, The sunny sylphid of the sunless ghyll. Thou bear'st an Oread panting for the gales That blow so purely there twixt fell and sky; Region forbid to Her, unless avails Thy might to lift her weaken'd frame so high. No vulgar charge is she for equine back, The very daughter of the Moorland Bard, Who, murmuring verse, now follows in thy track: (Oft has he climb'd Parnassian steeps as hard!) Ev'n now his song is of a deathless horse The horse Copenhagen, who carried the Duke of Wellington at Waterloo. Mr. Wordsworth composed his sonnet on Haydon's picture of that subject, while we were ascending Helvellyn. That bore the victor on the Belgic field:— Climb, Pony, climb! and thine heroic force A theme as worthy of his lay shall yield. Achilles' steeds survive in Homer's voice; Olympic racers live in Pindar's breath:— Is immortality like theirs thy choice? Climb, Pony, climb! and save thy name from death. So—halt and breathe—the first ascent is won, Hark, infant Rotha crows applausive glee; The Rotha was gurgling down at our right hand near this point, and was both seen and heard. Now start again—now zig-zag—bravely done! Crop now the herb, scant earnest of large fee. Now for another stubborn tug—take heed— A bright green swamp before thee lies—come round— These crags, though rude, may better serve our need; Oft are the roughest friends the truest found. Climb, Pony, climb! bend well the limber knee, Yon aged Poet watches thee with joy; And haply meditates that thou shalt be Matched with the Pony of his Idiot Boy. How now, ungracious Imp! what means that kick? Forelegs at stand! hind heels aloft in air! Would'st thou dislodge thy rider by a trick, As if elusive of reward so fair. Would'st thou then forfeit ages of acclaim For present ease, void saddle, and free rein? Perish the thought! tenacious of thy fame, Thy rider sits unmoved—that plunge is vain. Earth and her feet are strangers till thou reach The elastic sward on yonder topmost head; Be wise and gentle, Pony! all and each, Both man and beast, must toil for praise and bread. Ev'n while I moralise, we touch the end; Down, freshly winnowing now, the breezes come, Like angels that invisibly descend To tempt man upward, whispering of their home. Now, Dora, now, thy palfrey's task is o'er! The wide commanding ridge of peaks is gain'd; The very crowning pinnacle, no more A fancy sigh'd for, but a prize attain'd! August, 31st, 1840. ON THE REPORTED VISIT OF QUEEN ADELAIDE TO WORDSWORTH. That ancient Wizard of the Cumbrian Meres Hath won, 'tis said, a meed to poets rare, A visit from a Queen. If so, 'twas well; And unabased was dignity, howe'er August, in stooping at that poet's door. Him, the High Druid of the oak-clad fells And aqueous vales of our romantic North, The breasts of thousands, yea of millions, own To be the Seer whose power hath o'er them most A sway like that of conscience. One whose keen Mysterious eye peruses minds aright Ev'n in their shyest depths, and best rebukes The workings of that intricate machine For evil, most accelerates the springs That are the pulses of ingenuous deeds. He, in his sunny childhood, sported wild Among the wild-flowers and the pensile ferns That fringe the craggy banks of waterfalls, Whose pools were arch'd with irises enwoven Of spray and sunbeams: these into his mind Pass'd, and were blent with fancies of his own; And in that interfusion of bright hues His soul grew up and brighten'd. On the peaks Of mighty hills he learnt the mysteries That float 'twixt heaven and earth. The strenuous key Of cloud-born torrents harmonised his verse To strength and sweetness: but the voice that brake The cedars upon Lebanon—none else— Taught him to rend more stubborn stocks than they, The obdurate hearts of men: that awful voice, Which exorcised the serpent-haunted tree Of knowledge; and the perilous fruit, matured And chasten'd in the light of gospel-truth, Forbade not to that old man eloquent. July, 1840. MORALS FROM THE STARS. How few, on life's vain stage, enjoy their part! With her own torch pale Envy burns her heart. The low would rise; the high would soar; and still Dwarf Fortune lags behind the giant Will. Go, wiser thou,—however small thy state,— Peruse the stars, and then forgive the great. The stars in glory differ as in place: Some show a dim, and some a dazzling face; Some shine in groups, where each, by union strong, Appropriates splendours that to all belong; Myriads, too crowded for a separate sway, Merge in a lucid stream,—a Milky Way. Some, wandering, seem to dance from sphere to sphere, But timed by laws of harmony severe. Others in clusters interweave their rays, Trembling in air like floating wreaths of haze. Some fix'd in power, and jealous neighbours, dart Their rival beams; while others rule apart. Of these, One reigns superior and alone, A keen-eyed lustre on the polar throne, Lord of the magnet that compels the steel To guide o'er trackless seas th' adventurous keel. Yon azure wall, with starry sentries mann'd, Hides worlds, perhaps more wonderfully plann'd. Could sight prevail, with Galileo's glass, Athwart that flaming boundary to pass, Man might descry, beyond his prison bars, On every side a paradise of stars; Yet nowhere find exact proportion given: 'Tis not in earth, or sea, or air, or heaven. Read thou the earth in heaven, and things below By those above, in their unequal show. Look on the scatter'd difference of things, Content that few are nobles, fewer kings; That most are fated homely garb to wear, And mean the livery that thyself must bear; Content to live obscure, unknown to die, And in the poor man's grave forgotten lie; No mourner's love engraven o'er thy head, But starlike daisies on the turf instead. Stars of the grave, to hope and daylight true, Those flowers at nightfall shroud themselves from view; At dawn unclose their lids, and all day's space Look up to heaven with bright undoubting face: Simple expounders of a text sublime O'er sleeping dust that sleeps the night of time, They shut their eyes against the charnel gloom, And preach the Resurrection from the tomb. THE SPELL. Jemima! not that she is fair, And yet her beauty is excelling; Not for the mildly winning air, Her native sweetness gently telling; Not for the azure veins that streak Her neck and rounded arms so lightly; Not for the modest cheerful cheek, Where rosy blushes live so brightly. Not for the harmony of face, Of form, of manner, or of stature; Oh, not for any outward grace, She seems to me the pride of nature. Hers is a charm that thought may paint, But words are weak for its revealing: The temper of a gentle saint, Ruled by a matchless heart of feeling. 'Twas this that bade me seek my bride, When dreams were o'er of first affection; 'Tis this that, now her truth is tried, Sets reason's seal on love's election. 'Tis this, beyond the boast of birth, Beyond her beauty far excelling, That makes a paradise of earth, And home a dear Elysian dwelling. INTERIOR OF CANTERBURY CATHEDRAL, AS SEEN BY MOONLIGHT, SEPTEMBER 30, 1841. A spirit haunts to-night this reverend pile, The moon, the ghostly vestal of the aisle; Spirit of power, and not o'er hearts alone; She sheds a tender charm on glass and stone; The pillars of the temple, sign'd with light, Attest the beauty of the soul of night; The solemn arches, delicately flect, Smile with a grace that thanks its architect. A semicirque of yonder oriel shows As soft an arch as sunlit showers disclose; Yet all the heighten'd colours of the prism Are glowing there, distinct without a schism. Yon sumptuous window sparkles like a mine Of votive gems, restored to Becket's shrine; Stray flakes of light to kiss the floor come down, Like jewels shaken from the martyr's crown. The monumental effigies confess The presence of her touching loveliness: Yon pair, where Life and Death their moral teach, Monument of Archbishop Chicheley. Inform'd by her, more eloquently preach: Beneath a gorgeous canopy, with all Official gauds of pomp pontifical, The robed and mitred hierarch o'erlays The grim anatomy of what he was; So falls the gleam that in their silent strife Attenuate Death shines more than swelling Life. Lo, one who stands those forms supine beside, More like a vision than an earthly bride; Her pale cheek hallow'd by the lambent ray That streams its effluence on the sculptured clay. Oh wherefore lingers she at such a tomb, She whose May-wreath was twined of orange-bloom? “My own beloved! in life and death my own, What say those fearful monitors of stone, Proud Chicheley and his skeleton beneath?” “That in the midst of life we are in death.” “No more?”—“Aye more,” replied the stedfast wife, “That in the midst of death we are in life; The nearer death the nearer life are we, That only to allure us seems to flee.” What strain comes floating up the length of nave, A chaunt that might be music from the grave, The wail of Shades as if in cloistral gloom Confined, and longing for the trump of doom? One living voice supplies the teeming strain, Which choral echoes dreamily sustain. Pale listeners feel, but hardly know they listen, And tearless eyes with more than feeling glisten: Hush'd hearts are rapt beyond the lunar sphere, By faith transported to the eternal year, With all their wrongs and sorrows, every pain Of dear regret, too, following in her train, And catching as she soars a glory won From Him who kindles moonlight from the sun, Whose blazing orb itself is but the dim Reflection of a glance benign from Him. VERY UNFINISHED VERSES SUGGESTED BY THE SERRA OF GERÉS. Were I an idol to adore, Nor glittering gems nor golden ore Could so pervert my mind; Nor man, nor woman, nor the moon; Nor sun, the most divine-like boon That cheereth mortal kind. The moon, than woman lovelier far, Is yet but an unsteady star, In growth, or on the wane; Like woman's too, her smiles are sad, And make the earnest gazer mad At springtide of the brain. The dazzling god of olden days, Veil'd in a mystery of rays, Hath still too many a shrine; For many a poet's heart supplies A vainly burning sacrifice To Phœbus and the Nine. The strange unmeasurable deep, Low panting in his awful sleep, A god benign might seem; But I too oft have seen him wake, With every wave a hissing snake, More dreadful than a dream. So none of these, Moon, Sun, nor Sea, The idol of my choice should be, Though all have had their praise; I'd ask of Nature to supply Some fix'd transcendent majesty, Like Thee, sublime Gerés! Girt with a stedfast cloud of pines, His star-loved head above them shines Serener than a star, While eagles with a desert-voice, Around their father-king rejoice, Or hail him from afar. Behold the mighty Serra stand! Grim patron of a smiling land, His bounty never fails; But freely from his generous veins He yields the streams that feed the plains, The life-blood of the vales. When stormy uproar round him raves, When winds howl wolf-like in his caves, And through his forests chide, A type he stands of sufferance meek;— The peevish tempests smite his cheek, The lightnings pierce his side; And when their idle rage is o'er, More like a god he seems to soar, And shine with all his fountains— Yet, lip to earth, on height like this, 'Tis but a footstool that I kiss Of Him who made the mountains. “N'EVEILLEZ PAS LE CHAT QUI DORT.” I saw a pale and silent maid From all around her coldly turn, As if she were a lonely shade With whom the world had no concern. Was this a maid of bosom cold?— Who puts his trust in cloudless skies? Or ocean's calm? or fortune's hold? Or wavering woman's tranquil eyes? Though soft as snow the swan may glide, 'Tis peril to provoke her wing: And lamblike woman's soul of pride May sleep to wake with tiger-spring. You gaze as on a statue there, Nor fear her quiet beauty more— But there's a heart within—beware! N'eveillez pas le chat qui dort. THE ROSE-WREATHED HOUR-GLASS. Poets while away their leisure, Culling flowers of rhyme; Thus they twine the wreath of pleasure Round the glass of Time, Culling flowers of rhyme. Fancy's children, ever heedless, Why thus bribe the hours? Death to prove the trouble needless Withers all your flowers; Why then bribe the hours? Like the sand so fast retreating, Thus your hopes shall fall; Life and fame are just as fleeting; Poets, flowers, and all:— So your fancies fall. THE OLD MAN AND HIS DAUGHTERS. There came an Elder from the north, A shrewd and crabbèd carl was he, And muttering threats, he hurried forth To seek his truant daughters three. Three daughters as the Graces fair, Whom he would never trust from home, But who in spite of all his care Will each in turn contrive to roam. The earliest out of bounds was Spring, A nymph with violet-colour'd eyes: Her head with snowdrops covering, She stole away in that disguise. And meeting in her doubtful flight The Sun, she paused, and blush'd, and said, “If thou art brave as thou art bright, My sisters free from prison dread!” A smile he gave her in reply, Too fervent for her bloom so frail; It shamed the violet in her eye, And turn'd her hectic cheek to pale. But heedful of the maiden's word, He went and thaw'd the gelid door; Whence out rush'd Summer like a bird, And lightly bounded on before. Then linger'd, and at Spring look'd back, Spring laugh'd to see her panting there, Then vanish'd by a woodland track, Abash'd at Phœbus' saucy stare. But Summer eyed him like a queen Accustom'd to resplendent rays, While blushes through her brown cheek seen Were ripening in his ardent gaze. But where was Autumn? While their sire Was tracking Spring across the snow, She thought upon her father's ire, And hardly dared, yet long'd, to go. At last she rose and ventured out, And slily took the other way; But Winter now had turn'd about, And saw the traitress go astray. He follow'd her with crouching gait, Who, all unconscious, slack'd her pace, And meeting Summer, down they sate, And Summer slept in her embrace. But on her shoulder soon she felt Their father's rigid fingers cold: He bound them both with frozen belt, And dragg'd them to his icy hold. And hither too had Spring retraced Her way, for, wandering to and fro, Bewilder'd on a border waste, She knew not whither else to go. But though he has them all again In durance numb—the hard old man! Be sure, in spite of bolt and chain, Apollo their release will plan. Canterbury, August, 1838. FIRST LOVE. When first I saw her by the bleak sea-shore, Like the strong wave I felt my heart to leap: It left me then and dwelt with me no more, But lived with her, a dweller by the deep. She was my muse while yet my life was May, That soft serene, half melancholy girl! Nature had form'd her of no vulgar clay, Or if of dust, 'twas dust of ocean pearl. Her cheek was colourless; grave Passion there And smiling Innocence together strove; With one white rose-bud in her jet-black hair, She seem'd the spirit of unworldly love. Even now I scarce can look upon a star, A water-lily, or a passion-flower, But with a sigh that wafts my memory far Back unto her in youth's romantic hour. AT A BALL. Let us go to some place of rest, my soul! Why do we linger here? Where the night-winds pant, and the dull waves roll, And the sound and sight are drear; It will suit the worn spirit best, my soul! Then why should we linger here? What avail the gay notes and light foot of young pleasure, When the heart's not in tune to keep time with the measure. Not for us is the festive hall, my soul! Its groups like spectres grin; And music and dance as the death-bells toll In the ear of the child of sin; Ev'n thus on my heart they fall, my soul! And jar on the strings within. When the heart's out of tune, oh how harsh seems the measure, To which giddy groups whirl in the circle of pleasure! AVONDALE. ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG FRIEND, AN ADMIRER OF AN ITALIAN LADY. Boy! would'st thou have thy suit prevail? Go lead thy heart's enchantress o'er The woody steeps of Avondale, That guard the stream of Avonmore. Howe'er her partial mind pourtray The graces of her bard's Vaucluse, She'll there as charmèd haunts survey As ever soothed the Tuscan muse. For there from every zephyr's wing A fairy spirit gently calls, And there the waters wildly sing, And there a mimic Sorga falls: Though Arklow's woodlands proudly sweep, And Aghrim boasts its golden ore; Though wild is Cronroe's rocky steep, And wilder yet is lone Glenmore; Though Vartrey lightly bounding goes, As coy yet playful childhood strays; Though sweet Avoca sweeter flows Since young Catullus sung its praise; Let lovers roam o'er hill and vale, Yet never shall their eyes explore A fairer glen than Avondale, A lovelier stream than Avonmore. Then warmly while thy lips repeat The liquid verse she loves so well, Be sure her heart will kindly beat, Be sure her breast will softly swell: Dull must the lover be to fail, Or else a frozen nymph implore, Among the groves of Avondale, Beside the stream of Avonmore. AGNES OF HOLMGARD. Keep in shore by moonlight, ladies! Ocean's marge is spread with wiles, Heed the Runic tale of Agnes, echoed from the Baltic Isles: By the light that witches Fancy, roving in a moonlight mood, She beheld a gallant merman rising from the tideless flood. Down his neck and o'er his shoulders gleam'd his hair like threads of gold; Bright his eyes; his comely features were a marvel to behold. On his breast he wore sea-armour, scales that shone as burnish'd ore; Shining through that shallow cover, love was burning evermore. He began with notes prelusive, trying many an artful change; Then his passion boldly chaunted, in a music sweet and strange. “Listen, Agnes, I implore thee, listen, lovely as thou art; I, an Ocean King, adore thee; pity thou a breaking heart.” ‘Weave the mermaid-dance without me; gentle Merman, I am wed; Silver sands in spangled grottoes, foot of mine must never tread.’ “Lo,” he sang, and two small sandals floated to the pebbled beach, Rarely wrought of golden tissue, ruby-gemm'd the ties of each! “These bright sandals, rare in beauty as thy feet, I give to thee; Never was an earthly princess bravely shod as thou wilt be.” ‘Mark my blessed amber-necklace; this my pious mother gave, Ave Mary! should I leave her, grief would press her to the grave:’ “Lo,” he sang, and from his bosom drew a string of pearly beads! “Take it, Agnes, never princess wore on neck such ocean-seeds.” ‘This gold circlet on my finger binds me to an earthly lot; I have two and loving daughters; gentle Merman, tempt me not!’ “Lo,” he sang; and from his finger drew a wondrous jewell'd ring: “Take it, Agnes, never princess gain'd the like from earthly king. Take it, Agnes, beauteous Agnes, take it as my pledge of love; Caves of ocean nurture passion deeper far than earth above. Listen, Agnes, I implore thee, listen, lovely as thou art, I, an Ocean-King, adore thee; pity thou a breaking heart.” ‘Bright-eyed Merman, I have listen'd; I am thine for weal or woe, Thou hast conquer'd, bear me with thee to the dreamy halls below.’ Then he seal'd her ears and bade her close her lips, and through the waves Hand in hand they plunged together, down to the mysterious caves. Two years there, beneath the waters, Agnes dwelt from sorrow free; Two fair sons she bore, and proudly nursed her princes of the sea. One day, near their cradle seated, spinning at the crystal wheel, Hark! she heard the bells of Holmgard booming forth a solemn peal. Up she started from the cradle, left her wheel and elfin thread, Instant sought her Triton-lover, and in tender accents said: ‘Let me go, my gentle Merman, ere the hour of midnight toll, Back to Holmgard at the altar to petition for my soul!’ “Go,” he said “I will not stay thee; go, belovèd Agnes, go, Back to these thy babes returning, ere the beams of morning glow.” Then he seal'd her ears and bade her close her lips and dart away Upward through the verdant waters, shoreward to the pebbled bay. On she hasten'd; backward started, just as she had reach'd the church, For she saw her pious mother standing in the temple-porch. “Wherefore wouldst thou fly, my Agnes, why thy mother's love forsake; Whither, whither hast thou wander'd, leaving earnest hearts to break?” ‘I have lived below the Ocean, underneath the coral tree; I have wed the gallant Merman, father of my sons is he. Leave me, mother, let me enter, leave me in the church to pray; I must cleave the depths of ocean ere the coming break of day.’ “Hear me, Agnes, wait and listen; if thy mother's love be scorn'd, For thy two deserted daughters, hear me, and at last be warn'd. Day and night the wretched orphans wail and weep and waste away; Grief will kill them, they will perish; calling on thee night and day.” ‘What should ail them? let their father keep his growing plants from harm, Mine are ears that cannot hear them, guarded by a Merman charm!’ “If thy daughters are forgotten, whom thy purer bosom fed, Yet, in pity for their father, be their solace,—he is dead. Madden'd by thy flight he linger'd, raving for a faithless wife, Rushing then amidst the billows quench'd the sacred light of life; And the billows in compassion gave him to the shore again: Christian burial not denied him, here he sleeps within the fane.” ‘Mother, be to them a mother; let me pass thee, I must pray! I must cleave the depths of ocean ere the coming light of day.’ Now the iron tongue was knelling midnight with a clang profound, And the unprevailing mother vanish'd with the closing sound!— Agnes in the holy water dipp'd her finger, cross'd her brow, Brow and finger were unmoisten'd, all things holy shunn'd her now. She advanced, and every image, every type of holy things, Saintly statues, pictured martyrs, cherub groups with painted wings, Swam before her, glided from her, all at her approach recoiled. Agnes sprang to touch the altar with a sudden terror wild: But the very altar shunn'd her, fast and faster it retired; Pyx and crucifix receded; one by one the lamps expired: Save one silver lamp suspended o'er a newly graven tomb; Thither Agnes flew despairing, goaded by a present doom; By that lamp the name engraven on the marble's face she read, 'Twas her mother's!—at the portal she had communed with the dead! One shrill cry she gave of horror, on the marble falling prone, And the lamp went out and left her stretch'd on the sepulchral stone. There were young and tender voices, wailing on the sadden'd shore; Wailing for the fickle mother who must never see them more. There were feeble infant voices, deep beneath the ocean swell, Moaning for the hapless mother who had loved them but too well. THE LEGEND OF SAINT MEINRAD. Beside the Lake of Wallenstadt I saw a damsel fair and young, Beneath an ash-crown'd rock she sate, And thus the Maid of Glaris sung: On Etzel's Mount Saint Meinrad's hands His hut remotely rear'd, Where now the painted chapel stands That bears his name revered. In vain he made that lonely peak His home among the clouds; Rude Etzel's Mount, so bare and bleak, Was soon the goal of crowds. Repentant sinners thither came, His blessing to implore; He bless'd them in his Master's name, And bade them sin no more. Nor dead to Nature's yearnings then With mortals he conferr'd; The voice and social helps of men His human feelings stirr'd. Yet, having vow'd to stand apart, Unpropp'd by human aids, He plunged into the deeper heart Of black Einsidlen's shades. And there again his patient hands An humble dwelling raised, Where now our Lady's chapel stands: (Her holy name be praised!) A sparkling well refresh'd the place Where shines her altar now; (Whose pure unfailing fount of grace Rewards the pilgrim's vow.) That crystal spring his drink supplied; Its cresses were his food, With berries that the mountains hide, And fruits unsunn'd and crude. Saint Meinrad knelt one early morn Beside the crystal fount; He heard a raven's croak forlorn Each pater-noster count. He heard a raven's dismal cry At every bead he told; “Now, God be praised! for I shall die,” Said he, “ere I grow old.” He look'd about, nor long he search'd, Making the Cross's sign, Before he saw two ravens, perch'd Above him on a pine. Saint Meinrad knelt upon the floor That eve within his cell, When angry sounds besieged his door; He knew their meaning well. He cross'd his breast and thank'd the Lord Who died upon the Rood; He calmly then the door unbarr'd, And there two ruffians stood. They rush'd upon the sacred man, Who meekly met his doom; About the floor his life-blood ran, Exhaling sweet perfume. A golden chalice (used to hold The host, the spirit's health) They seized, and crucifix of gold, Their victim's only wealth. The ravens came and flapp'd their wings O'er each assassin's head; Then, struck with inward shudderings, The ghastly wretches fled. In vain they fled to cavern'd rocks, And sought the loneliest gulf Where, ever, crouch'd the nursing fox, Or lurk'd the grim she-wolf. In vain the white-furr'd mountain hare They startled in their flight, And roused the chamois from his lair On Schindeleggi's height. In vain they tried the otter's den, By watery Richterswyl; Or hollow trees in Teuffel's glen, Among the owls so shrill. Aye follow'd by those ravens twain, Bewilder'd with heaven's wrath, To right, to left, they turn'd in vain; The ravens cross'd their path. They cross'd them with denouncing shrieks; They doom'd them with their eye; Their feathers brush'd their bloodless cheeks, So closely swoop'd they by. In vain they left those wild retreats, And tried the peopled town, Through all the throng of Zurich's streets The ravens chased them down. They flew at them with piercing shrieks, They tore them with their claws, They bit them with their horny beaks, Till they confess'd the cause: Till they confess'd their mortal guilt, And, guarded, forth were led; And for the saintly blood they spilt, The cruel ruffians bled. VAL DE LUZ. In Val de Luz, the vale of light, A hamlet neither fair nor bright That valley's title bears— (As honours oft by merit won, Descend to some ignoble son, Or wealth to worthless heirs.) A narrow street of squalid huts, Fierce visaged men and fiercer sluts With eyes and elf-locks black, And earth-brown features, grinning scorn, The passing stranger seem'd to warn, “Beware of an attack!” Such hints are spurs, but yet the last Ill-omen'd shed was scarcely past When check'd was every bridle! What halts us here?—a torrent strong, A mighty flood of glorious song— (It wafts me back to Rydal.) The nightingale of lusty lungs, The bird that has the gift of tongues, The key to every breast, 'Twas he that, as we rode along, Waylaid us with a flood of song That held us in arrest. No wanderer thro' a dark pine wood To brigand mandate ever stood More suddenly than we; Stopt by a bird in open day, An attic bird that ambush'd lay Behind an olive tree! DIALOGUE BETWEEN A MOOR OF GRANADA AND HIS SPANISH PRISONER. MOOR. Christian captive, heed not fortune, Tell thy name and true degree; Boldly speak, and frankly answer, Then light ransom sets thee free. CHRISTIAN. Moor! my name is Quinonero, Lorca is my native spot, Knight and warrior, though thy captive, Fortune's malice daunts me not. Such are war's accustom'd chances, Fate to day declares me thine, But a change may come to-morrow, And the change may make thee mine. Yet, if thou hast further question, I have no unwilling ear; Ask, and I will answer freely, Unrestrain'd at least by fear. MOOR. Yonder then are trumpets sounding, Pennons yonder wave in air; Turn thine eyes to yonder olives, Horse and foot are marshall'd there. I would have then, Quinonero, All the truth by thee avow'd: What the standards yonder glancing, Who the warriors thence advancing, With a gait so brave and proud? CHRISTIAN. That red flag superbly bearing Six embroider'd crowns of gold, That leads on the men of Murcia; Need their fame to you be told? On the next a king is blazon'd, Armed in mail to front the foe: Ask your troops! Granada's people Lorca's standard well should know. Lorca, nearest to your borders, Ever too is first in fight; Hers are men by nature martial, War is their supreme delight. Art thou answer'd? What remains then But for battle to provide? See with what good haste they press thee, Of thy prize to dispossess thee, And thy destiny decide. MOOR. Yes, I see them onward bearing, Bold their speed: but not a man Steps beyond yon stony causeway, By the sacred Alcoran! If, by prowess unexampled, That important line be cross'd, Well I know of such their triumph, We shall dearly pay the cost. There's the trial! let them come then! We are ready for the game! Sound and loudly sound the zambra! Let it reach our own Alhambra, And our chivalry proclaim! ZELINDA. “What says my lord?” Zelinda cried, “From yonder pine-tree spring!” “Alas!” the woeful prince replied, “Thy lover's scarf I bring.” “I know then well for whom,” she said, “The Houris now rejoice:” And not a tear the mourner shed, The woe was in her voice. She thank'd the prince with tearless eyes, And, when his tale was told, She turn'd to hide her blood-stain'd prize, As miser hides his gold. That night the Queen, by pity sway'd, Would go and vigil keep Beside Zelinda's couch, the maid Whose sorrow would not weep. Within her own alcove she found The maiden laid to rest; A scarf across her bosom bound, One hand upon it prest. The gracious Queen with pity smiled, With joy and pity meek, To see the sleeper's woe beguiled, And gently kiss'd her cheek; And softly as a mother moves, Who fears the dew to shake Of slumber from the flower she loves, Who fears her babe to wake, So softly did the Moorish Queen Lie down to share repose With her who slept in such serene Oblivion of her woes. The royal dame to slumber's yoke Her own thoughts bent in vain, And daylight's earliest glimmer broke Her dream's transparent chain. Zelinda still lay placidly As in the last night's gloom, Just as a sculptured effigy Reposes on a tomb. Her dark locks round her fair face curved, As round the moon a cloud; And from her bosom had not swerved That scarf's ensanguined shroud. And by the fine lids, darkly fringed, Her eyes half-curtain'd were, And though her lips with blood were tinged, A heavenly smile was there. The royal lady shuddering cried, “Zelinda, how is this? Wake, smiling sleeper!” and she tried To wake her with a kiss. She prest the clay-cold cheek in vain; Last night 'twas faintly warm— All night the gentle Queen had lain Beside a lifeless form. THE DUKE OF ALBA. SUGGESTED BY THE PORTUGUESE BALLAD PRECEDING. Rumour through the city carries Evil news for gentle dames, That the Duke of Alba marries One of Seville's highest names. Evil rumour seldom tarries: Woe for Donna Anna's dreams! Yet the busy tidings miss'd her, Tidings all the town had heard, Till her little laughing sister Running brought the fatal word; Saying, as she sweetly kiss'd her, Merry as an April bird, Saying, “Know you, Donna Anna, Know you what is soon to be? Wed will be the Duke of Alba With a dame of high degree.” Coldly answer'd Donna Anna, “Prattler, what is that to me?” But her knees beneath her falter, But her heart within her burns; Woe and wonder both assault her, To her chamber as she turns. Alba's Duke before the altar! Woe for love that honour spurns! Sadly in her room she paces, Sadly paces to and fro; Then about the mansion chases Cruel thoughts that will not go; Then again her steps retraces, Now above, and now below. Then she bade the gates be fasten'd, Never closed by day before; Upward then again she hasten'd, There to pace her chamber floor. Tears in vain her sorrow chasten'd, Sighs but fann'd her grief the more. Weary then she took her station Where her casement show'd the square; Saw with fearless trepidation, Saw the Duke of Alba there: Sign'd him, waving a carnation, 'Neath her balcon to repair. “What would you, my Donna Anna, What would you, my life, with me?” “I would have you, Duke of Alba, Though 'tis false and cannot be, Tell me if the Duke of Alba Weds a dame of high degree?” “'Tis not false, my Donna Anna, 'Tis not false, my love and life: For to-morrow will an heiress Be the Duke of Alba's wife; And I bid you to the bridal, Wish me joy, my love and life!” Duke of Alba, words are crushing! Senseless fell she to the ground: Doors were burst, and men came rushing To the maiden prostrate found; Blood from forth her lips was gushing, Blood that well'd without a wound. By a golden chain suspended Lay a treasure next her heart; Noble features finely blended By the painter's mimic art; 'Twas the Duke of Alba's portrait, And she wore it next her heart. Yet she lived, nor deign'd accuse him. When she woke, the gem she spied. “What is this, if I must lose him? Take it to the bridegroom's bride, Let her wear it in her bosom, Though with blood of mine 'tis dyed!” Hearts abused by heartless follies Seek their peace in convent shades; Donna Anna finds her solace With Saint Clara's holy maids: Yet—for 'twas a bitter chalice— Memory oft her peace invades. Seven years are gone and over; Comes her mother to the grate: “Oh! forget your worthless lover, Pass with me the convent gate.” “How forget him! Mother, mother! Once for me his love was great.” “Still you love the Duke of Alba, Love him with a passion wild, Love him as I love you, Anna, As a mother loves her child; Oh! forget the Duke of Alba!” Weeping, said the mother mild. “Yes, I loved him, mother, mother! More, alas, than lips can tell! No, I love him not, my mother: Oh! I loved him passing well! Duke of Alba wed another! Leave me, leave me to my cell!” San João da Foz, July 9, 1845. THE GROVES OF ENTRE QUINTAS. Where scenes so sweet the Douro greet Before he joins the main, Where nature hails from Porto's vales That truant child of Spain; Where many a green and golden screen Adorns his banks romantic, Ere yet he glides among the tides, And tastes the salt Atlantic; Though many a muse might pause to choose 'Twixt Freixo and Avintes, No bowers can strike my fancy like The groves of Entre Quintas. There stands the tree of lordly grace, Of all Magnolias grandest; And there I saw the fairest face, The fairest and the blandest. I saw a smile, alas the while, It was not meant for me! I saw a cheek whose beauty meek I never more shall see. A voice I heard, and every word Was music soft and clear; That thrilling tone till life is flown I ever more shall hear. Farewell! the bowers of orange flowers From Porto to the sea! Farewell thy blooms of rich perfumes, Superb magnolia tree. Farewell the rills on sunny hills Ten thousand flowerets laving; And fountains bland to coolness fann'd By willows o'er them waving. Arcades of vines, and groves of pines That clothe each rocky fell; And every shrub that greenly shines, And every bud, farewell! And fare thee well, thou fairest grace Beside the western sea! Thy form will haunt me to my place Beneath the cypress-tree. EPITAPH ON COLONEL GEORGE HOLMES, C.B. TRANSCRIBED ON A MONUMENT (BY WESTMACOTT) CAUSED TO BE PLACED BY HIS WIDOW IN THE PARISH CHURCH AT DONCASTER. Heart ever steady to a manly mind, Good, gallant heart, repose in honour shrined! Stern are a soldier's duties; and but few Like Holmes accomplish'd, and yet smooth'd them too: His cordial voice the tasks of peace endear'd: And war's severest toils and perils cheer'd: And many a veteran's hand may grateful wave A Spanish laurel o'er his English grave. The martial chief—the gay and social friend Words cold as this sad marble may commend, Sacred to silent memory and tears, And yearning hopes to meet in purer spheres, And to lone anguish in a widow'd breast, The brother's, father's, husband's merits rest. EPITAPH ON J. K. E. HOLMES. DROWNED IN THE WYE, JUNE 16, 1848. In joyous youth on Wye's green verge he stood, And in a moment perish'd in the flood; The fatal river of the wealth it stole Gave back the casket, gone the precious soul. Dread Lord of Life! taught by thy blessed Son, A wife, a mother, say, “Thy will be done.” On them hath sorrow set an awful mark: But Heaven looks brighter as this world grows dark. Teach them to show their infant charge the way To find her father on that final day, When earth and all its waters shall restore The dead redeem'd in Christ, to part no more! FUNERAL OF ROBERT SOUTHEY. Crossthwaite Tower sends forth a knell; Skiddaw knows its meaning well; And the mountain veils its head, As they bear away the dead; Scawfell hides his towering height; Glaramara shrinks from sight; All the solemn steeps around Hide their faces at the sound; Derwent hears it; Greta hears; And, while the clouds supply their tears, The troubled rivers as they swell Hoarsely chide that funeral bell. Mr. Southey was buried on the 24th of March, 1843, in the north-west corner of Crossthwaite Church-yard, Keswick, about half a mile from Greta Hall, the house which had been his home for forty years, when he there died. Herbert's haunt, on Keswick-mere, Feels the ghost of genius near; Lodore sends a deeper wail To the rough heart of Borrowdale; Stream and lake, and force and fell, Sylvan isle and rocky dell, Their part in this day's sorrow bear; And heavier make the gloom they share; For our human feelings give Sympathies that in them live. Where a hedge of blackthorn blooms Close beside the place of tombs, As the Bearers bear the Dead, Pacing slow with solemn tread, Two feather'd choristers of spring To the dark procession sing: Heedless of the driving rain, Fearless of the mourning train, Perch'd upon a trembling stem They sing the poet's requiem. Some sacred frenzy has possest These warblers of the russet breast, To honour thus with friendship brave, A Poet's passage to his grave. The writer, who was present at the funeral, can apologise for the introduction of so trifling, but not unaffecting, an incident as that related of these birds, by assuring the reader that their prolonged singing in the situation, and under the circumstances alluded to, is a fact which attracted his own notice. Poet, what avails it now That the laurel graced thy brow?— What avail'd it years before The angel death thy summons bore? When thy noble mind o'erwrought Stranded lay, a wreck of thought? Thy bruised spirit, all that while, Was blind to fame's approving smile. Deaf and careless wert thou then To the plausive tongues of men, As now to notes—more sweet than words— Flowing from the hearts of birds; As now to the sepulchral bell Which smites the vale that loved thee well. Honour built on virtue's rock Nor disease nor death can shock. Poet, virtue's priest wert thou! So yet the laurel decks thy brow. This avails thee now and ever, Guerdon of thy high endeavour; Love and honour ne'er forsake thee, Till the trump of doom awake thee: Tolls the bell for vanish'd worth— Earth to earth surrenders earth. Life has lower'd death sublime Down the shallow pit of time; Thence, when ripen'd in that mine, A gem on heaven's brow to shine: Hid, till then, its precious light By the jealous miser night, And yet play'd on all the while By the deep supernal smile That can pierce the stone and lead, Which o'erlay the virtuous dead— Just as well as it can reach Planets in their gulfs of air, Lending brightness due to each In its duly portion'd share: To the sun its light creative, To the moon its borrow'd force, To the stars a lustre native From the One Eternal Source! ELEGY ON G. M. B. ADDRESSED TO LADY B. Thy child was lull'd on death's cold couch to sleep. Years since have pass'd, and yet I see thee weep; Yet, yet, by busy memory kept alive, The heart-struck mother's griefs, alas! survive. Is there no blessed spell, no opiate blest, To cheat a mother's memory to rest? Look on the lovely treasures that remain Let these seduce thee from regrets so vain. Oh no: by links too powerful are allied The joy for these that live, the woe for him that died. In life's young season, when the world was new, And love adorn'd it with enchantment's hue, He, the first pledge which love awoke to light, Was more than angel in thy partial sight. Ah! who can tell the youthful mother's joy, When first her arms received her infant boy? When first she saw, what fancy help'd to trace, The father's features in his little face, When first she gave her first maternal kiss, Ah! what are words to paint a mother's bliss! Fed from thy breast, in charms the infant grew, Fresh as the May-morn flower that drinks the dew. Then, as the term of boyhood just began, How well the Boy gave promise of the Man; When, warm for enterprise, and pall'd with ease, The gallant child went forth, and dared the seas! What serves it here in long detail to tell The proving chances that the child befell; Each toil and watch endured by day and night, Each rough assault of tempest or of fight; To tell what lands he saw; how oft he bore Some classic relic from the famous shore: How oft return'd (ah why again to roam?) To taste the dear felicity of home; And pause awhile from ocean's rude alarms; The harbour of his rest a mother's arms. I saw, ere last the wanderer left thy side, This cherish'd object of thy pain and pride. I saw him clad with beauty as a vest, His graceful form the graceful mind express'd. I mark'd that mind, so young, yet so matured By painful trial, manfully endured. Talent's strong sun had forced the vernal shoot, At once it bore the blossom and the fruit; Then friendship too, in sympathy with thee, Was idly dreaming what the youth would be. A Hero, diadem'd with glory's crown, To gild his ancient name with new renown. Where is he now? thus gifted and thus fair, Could not the hand of Heaven the stroke forbear? So good, so young, so beautiful and brave, Was it not hard to doom him to the grave? To bid disease assail with jealous tooth The rich unfolding roses of his youth, And blighting them, the mother's hope to blight, The hope that promised such a long delight? Yet, it were something still if o'er the clay Of him thus early snatch'd from life away, Maternal love but now and then might keep A little sacred interval to weep. Alas! fond mother! this too is denied; Far, far away, from home, from thee, he died. Minorca's air received his latest breath; Its earth too gave his narrow cell of death. To dew his fading cheek with pious tear, No parent, brother, sister, tended near: No sister, brother, parent, e'er must weep Beside the bed wherein his ashes sleep. Child of the Ocean! had the troubled wave, Thine own proud element, become thy grave, When all thy soul with generous rage was warm'd, Hadst thou been struck while gallant battle storm'd. Then by thy fall had fame at least been bought: So whispers fancy to a mother's thought. Delusion! could that mother's thought have borne The bosom gash'd, the limb asunder torn, The life-blood, none perhaps its tide to check, Effusive o'er the horror-drenched deck, The form convulsed, the shriek of torment wild, The last dull moaning of her dying child? No, no, though doom'd to fall, poor boy, 'twas well That not in battle's hideous fray he fell. Thy tears, fond mother, though so long they flow, Are not the rash impiety of woe. Rebellion brands not the afflicted mind— Regret may deeply mourn, yet be resign'd: And heaven, in mercy to a mother's grief, Permits those tears to lend a sad relief. Perchance at times 'tis e'en allow'd thy boy To quit for thee his Paradise of joy! Perchance, e'en now, the disembodied saint Is hovering near, to silence grief's complaint, Breathe comfort to his mother's aching heart, And act at once the son's and angel's part. I do believe, that when the good ascend, To live the empyreal life that ne'er shall end, 'Tis not denied them in that world to meet Those for whose sakes e'en this bad world was sweet; That friends and kindred are allow'd above Each to know each again, in purer love; That in the presence of the Great Adored, Again the spouse may meet the spouse deplored; Sister and brother form the ring again, And parted lovers bind the broken chain; Fathers amidst their gather'd children rest, And tender mothers bless them and be blest. I do believe, to mothers such as thou Will Heaven this perfect blessedness allow. While seraphs up to heaven thy soul translate, Thy child shall meet thee at the Golden Gate; Shall bid thee welcome to the Promised Land, Shall guide thee in through all the glorious band; While all the angels clap their wings with joy, And hail ye both, the mother and her boy! And these, yet left to her who gave them birth, To cheer her further sojourn upon earth, These, who with youth elate and blind to care Now round thee wanton, shall rejoin thee there. There too, where never the high heart is rack'd, Where never cares the noble mind distract, Where feeling, fancy, genius unrepress'd May thrill, expand, exalt the unburthen'd breast, There shall the generous lyre, that here below Wafts scarce a note beside the note of woe, No more by sorrow warp'd, by envy jarr'd, Breathe all the lofty spirit of the bard, Whom, while thine offspring listen to that lyre, Their eyes and hearts shall know, and bless their sire. Lee Priory, September 16th, 1815. ELEGY ON E. W. G. B. ADDRESSED TO LADY B. Another blow from Heaven! and wherefore thus Shall human woe the act of Heaven discuss? Shall roused affliction lift to God her eye, And, knowing that He will'd it, question why? Tried mother, bow thy head, and quell thy breast, And check the unholy murmur ere exprest; There was too much of good about thee still, Baffling the jealous counterpoise of ill. The draught of life was yet too strong for care, Schemes were too quick, and hopes too busy there; So grief again, as bubbles mantled up, Was sent to tame the spirit of the cup: Ask thine own heart—descend into that cell Where lives the Priestess of Truth's Oracle, Conscience, that breathes self-knowledge; She will say, A mother's pride too deeply rooted lay Within thy bosom; giving thoughts of earth More room than aught terrestrial should be worth. The love of thine own lovely race was such As held thee fetter'd to the world too much: So death was made thy visitor again, To break another rivet of the chain, That to thy mind's ambition might be given A freer aspiration after Heaven. Twice on the treasure of thy soul the hand That lent it has enforced a stern demand. Yet think, afflicted parent, for thy peace, How may the seeming loss thy wealth increase. If both so early in the grave they lie, They both were innocent and fit to die. Fairer than stars their spirits glow above; And from their sphere depends a chain of love, A chain of light to thee and thine descending, Whereby riven hearts in mystic links are blending; And the pure fires with which those spirits glow Can thrill and lighten on the hearts below. Direct thy gaze, thou cherisher of woes, Where yon meek spire the hamlet's temple shows: Is there no comfort in that place of prayer? Alas, those tears deny all solace there. Fuller and faster at the view they fall, As though that sight were bitterer than all. Well; who shall censure those o'erflowing eyes? Religion's self will scarce refuse her sighs. We all remember when each Sabbath morn Saw thy young group that humble fane adorn; With him, among the rest, of guileless brow— Where is that dear and guileless Edward now? When then ye glanced upon that vault beneath, No echo warn'd you from that seat of death, Whose shade at last must shroud you all, that doom Adjudged him next into that cold dark room. Death stole upon thee in a doubtful mask; The black destroyer wanton'd with his task; And mock'd with promise thy maternal hope; And gave,—that's some relief—thy virtues scope. We all remember—how can we forget—? Those nightly vigils, that should soothe regret; Those daily cares, and duties overpaid, While the youth wasted to a bloodless shade. We all remember, how, until the last, Clung by his side this mother unsurpass'd; Caught every tone, consulted every look, Read every thought, and every wish o'ertook: And, in despite of pain's exerted fangs, Foil'd the tormentor of his keenest pangs. Propp'd on his pillow as the victim lay, While Life just pruned her wings to fleet away, Cheer'd by her flutter, it was sweet, he said, To lie thus careless on a tranquil bed; And thence behold the trees in tender green, And all the freshness of a vernal scene; And feel the breeze that sometimes flew by stealth To fan his cheeks and warble words of health. Then came the hour!—the spirit waxing dim, The helpless, hopeless feebleness of limb; The wandering hands that quarrell'd with the air, The glance that flicker'd round, but knew not where; The language wilder than the trackless wind; The last delirious energies of mind; The cheeks like wither'd aspen leaves in hue, And like those leaves all coldly shuddering too; The quivering throat's half-choked and struggling cry; And last, that fix'd expression of the eye! Not yet; not yet; it cannot yet be o'er; The soul still lights that face—O gaze no more, Unhappy father! wherefore didst thou stay, Watching the progress of thine own decay, The dread mortality of thine own flesh, That seems in those that yet remain so fresh? Away! even she who watch'd as none have watch'd, She, the poor mother with the heart unmatch'd, Dragg'd by the arm of friendship from the room, Has left him—to the agents of the tomb. Take thy last look, and let it linger not; And let us lead thee from the blighted spot. In your sepulchral chamber, corse to corse, Ye still shall meet, in spite of this divorce; In the eternal kingdom, soul to soul, Ye still may live, when planets cease to roll. SHORT POEMS IN MEMORY OF JEMIMA A. D. QUILLINAN, WHO DIED IN MAY, 1822. I. [Madness, if thou wilt let me dwell] Madness, if thou wilt let me dwell With Thee in some fantastic hell, Some chaos of the mind, For Thee I'll quit the friends of years, The loves of youth, the hopes and fears About the heart-strings twined. For joy has dried, for me, her springs, And Death has shadow'd with his wings An Eden to a waste, And I am left in lone distress, Mark'd with a curse of hopelessness Too deep to be erased. I had a friend—Where is she now? I mock thee with my placid brow, I mock thee with my smile: But search, wild Power, my heart's despair; Her epitaph is written there, There woe is without guile. Griefs have o'erwhelm'd me oft before, But then my buoyant spirit bore Against their stormy tide: I listen'd to the voice of men; Some cheer'd me from the shore, and then I struggled through with pride. Oft have I been perplex'd with woes, But then there was a dear repose From trouble and from pain: I look'd in Beauty's tender eyes, And there encounter'd sympathies That soothed the aching brain. I went abroad among the hills; I traced the streams and humming rills That through the woodlands stole; I walk'd with Nature, and communed With all her birds, and they attuned The jarrings in my soul. I cannot pray—I still have pray'd, In weal or woe, for mercy's aid To guide me on my way; But this too heavily hath prest; And there is hardness in my breast, And now I cannot pray. Then make me thine! I fear thee not. Better the shrieking maniac's lot Than this wild sense of gloom; These thick still thoughts of full distress, Brooding o'er blighted happiness Like yew-trees o'er a tomb. Then make me thine! I love the tune Of the starved dog that bays the moon, While angry echo jars: Make me thy priest, and let me chaunt, From some rent fane that spectres haunt, Strange anthems to the stars. II. Near Lauffenberg. On Lauffen's river, green and swift, The rays of morning shine; Bright mists are on the hills adrift, The breathing of the Rhine. The flood, the hills, the hazy veil, Of other scenes remind, Where shines a lake in Loughrigg dale, Where Rotha's waters wind: An ivied cot by Rotha's side, Beneath a rocky knoll; And Her, its ornament and pride, The treasure of my soul: Her store of all the heart could crave To make her beauty dear, Her sorrows, and her early grave, The cause that I am here. III. Near Schaffhausen. HER FAVOURITE FLOWERS. I cannot bear those brilliant flowers So blue among the corn, With which she used in festal hours Her tresses to adorn. I cannot bear that they should still Be beautiful and gay, When she who loved their bloom so well Has past in hers away. IV. SOCIETY. BERNE. The sad must wear the jester's mask; And surely 'tis the hardest task That can the sad employ: Grief has no privilege to ask For sympathy from joy. It is a melancholy art To take the theme the gay impart With a complacent smile: They little think the secret heart Is aching all the while. V. SCHWYTZ. The relics of her human charms Are lock'd in earth's maternal arms By Grasmere's quiet shore; Her spirit, ever bright and pure, Is where there are no ills to cure, Where pain torments no more. An exile from a blighted home, From land to land I vainly roam, And seek, but cannot find In nature, nor in powerless art, Some charm to lull an aching heart, To soothe a troubled mind. Severe it seems, and only seems, To rouse from life's delusive dreams The beautiful and young: If, like Jemima good as fair, They wake, we trust, in purer air, Immortal joys among; Theirs is the harder lot who mourn, Who, with a vain compunction, burn To expiate faults that grieved A breast they never more can pain, A heart they cannot please again— The living, the bereaved. O vain complaint of selfishness! Weak wish to paralyse distress! The tear, the pang, the groan, Are justly mine, who once possess'd, Yetn sometimes pain'd, the fondest breast Where love was ever known. VI. THE LAKE OF LAUWERTZ. Like Rydal with its sister-isles The little lake of Lauwertz smiles; If less exquisitely fair, Yet the very character; The very road along the shore, And tufted rocks projecting o'er; Straggling orchards like the same, Plots of green that kindred claim: E'en the lilies float and lave, And the reeds are on the wave; And the lights of morning make Mimic lines across the lake. All but Goldau's ruins seem Rydal in a faithful dream. Goldau's ruins!—more than all The resemblance they recall. Tell they not the o'erwhelming doom Of soft beauty in its bloom; Virtue, joy, and tenderness, All that happy homes could bless, In a moment's awful fate Crush'd beneath a mountain's weight? Why should Rydal seem like this? Let the memory of bliss, Let its ruin, answer why— Let Jemima's grave reply. VII. BERNE. I saw to day a roseate cheek, A soft blue eye, and tender air; Her very traits appear'd to speak, But only seem'd not quite so fair. I never see a roseate cheek, A soft blue eye, and tender air, But that the features seem to speak Of early death and lonely care. VIII. LAUSANNE. Time slowly knits the strongest ties, No ardent heat at first I felt; But slowly did her tender eyes To love the snow of friendship melt. I play'd no wild enthusiast's part; Her outward beauty scarce address'd; She charm'd me by the noble heart That beat beneath her modest breast. In after years of wedded life Her virtues taught me all their claim; 'Twas not the mistress, but the wife Of whom the lover I became. Yet—shall remorse the truth avow? Her form is now but mouldering earth; And now, alas! and only now, I know Jemima's utmost worth. So when the sacred light of Heaven Has first illumined infant eyes, The child enjoys the blessing given, Unconscious how divine a prize. As reason wins by slow degrees Dominion o'er the ductile mind, Delighted more the more he sees, He blesses God he is not blind. But, if the curse of blindness seals His orbs, and blots the world from sight, O then the victim fully feels The value of the blessed light. ELEGY ON THE SAME, WRITTEN TWELVE YEARS LATER. TO SIR EGERTON BRYDGES. I crown thee, Brydges, with a baleful wreath, And raise another deeper cry of death! I seem ordain'd by mystery and fear To breathe sepulchral horrors in thine ear, And deck thee victim of some mortal curse, With sullen garlands of funereal verse. When Thou and thy two boys were wrench'd apart, I raised the death-lament that thrill'd thy heart, Yet soothed thy pride. It seem'd a stern decree That let the tempest loose to shake thy tree, And bear the crude fruit down,—but wild and rough Though blew those angry gales, 'twas not enough! A fiercer hurricane was yet to come: It came; I heard, and shudder'd, and was dumb; It swept away the best of all thy race, And there was darkness in Jemima's place. My loss was then severer far than thine: I felt at first too stupid to repine: But soon was roused to consciousness of pain By stormy thoughts and tumults of the brain; And then by lawless wretchedness betray'd, I did but outrage mild Jemima's shade; For, driven by passion to rebellion's verge, I call'd the Furies to perform her dirge. No Furies answer'd, but a little child Look'd in my face and like her mother smiled. As waters from the stricken rock devolved, Smote by that look, my eyes in tears dissolved, Wild bursts of tears, yet powerful to assuage The fever and the impiety of rage. My anguish now was calmer, not less keen: I sought, afar, diversity of scene; All heart-sick wretches hope to flee from care, And still they flee to find her everywhere. I stood beside the Rhine's chaotic fall: What did that pomp of bounding waves recall? Lone cataracts, and coy unnamed cascades, And modest waterfalls in woody shades, Among the hills of Westmoreland, where long And oft Jemima listen'd to their song. In Zurich's Grove at Gessner's tomb I wept Not him, who there, but her who distant, slept, And but for her sake wish'd to me bequeath'd The adorning spirit that in Gessner breathed; The double tribute of a painter-bard Might so through time her sacred memory guard; So might those features eloquently meek Still to the heart with sure persuasion speak; So might the world her sweet example save, And Art be twice triumphant o'er the grave. I climb'd the Kamor mountain ridged with fir, To be a little nearer Heaven and Her. In vain the Rheinthal smiled with all its vines: The rocks of Appenzel, the gloomy pines, And lonely ice-beds pleased my alter'd mind, And the wild howling of the glacial wind. How still in yon far mountain clefts, my soul, Reposed the eternal snows of the Tyrol! Thus still in death, as pure, as cold, as white, She slept in the grim fold of breathless night. I see her yet in that familiar room Where last she lay, apparell'd for the tomb. Trick'd out with sweet fantastic flowers she lay, Cold to the touch that press'd the life-like clay, Blind to the eyes that rivetted their gaze, Deaf to the voice she loved in other days. I bear to think, I bore to brood on this! With lingering lips the passive brow to kiss, And o'er the hush'd unsympathising corse To stand in blank despair and vain remorse, While all my faults, held light in happier times, From death's pale shadow took the hue of crimes. Not to a father need I tell her worth Who saw its growth, to womanhood from birth; Her lucid sense, without a stain of pride; Her taste with pure simplicity allied; Her tranquil manners, so reserved with ease; Her care unwearied, not to shine, but please: Her graceful truth, the ornament and bond Of coy affections exquisitely fond; Her temper, human nature's precious ore, In sorrow's crucible refined the more. Whether she graced her own paternal home, Or shared a soldier's restless fate to roam; Whether by blind adversity opprest, Or worn by sickness, late her frequent guest; Through many a trying year I never saw Her will rebellious to her duty's law. Nor e'er beheld an evil passion chase Love from her lips nor beauty from her face. Some minds repose in apathetic rest, Without a feeling, negatively blest: Patient because untempted to transgress; But hers was sensibility's excess; A nature quick, too full of hopes and fears, All turn'd to smiles and tenderness and tears. She sleeps in Britain's Eden, on the shore Of mead-fringed Grasmere girt with mountains hoar! Far from her native Kent: yet not forsaken Of friends found faithful when my heart was shaken; True friends as e'er appalling sorrow tried, In-dwellers of the valley where she died. Her relics too are of that earth a part, Whose meanest flower has school'd its poet's heart; And the same airs that stir the grass around Her tomb, are agents to his thoughts profound; Deepening the murmurs musically strong Of Wordsworth's grand and philosophic song. Brydges, remote from where thy fathers sleep, While other hands than thine thy harvests reap, Far from the hearth of Wootton and the hill Whose greenwoods whisper thy young fancies still, Thine age is whitening where Helvetian snows From glowing sunsets catch the tints of rose; Thine age embellish'd too with colours caught From Fancy's richly-setting orb of thought. Thine ear is greeted by the rushing Rhone, And liquid voices of yet grander tone. Lake, river, cataract, ravine, and glen, Rock, forest, pike, are all within thy ken. Charm'd land! which Nature in some frantic fit Heaved to the skies, in monstrous masses split, Nor blush'd to view the havoc she had made, But gulf and chasm with dauntless eye survey'd: And, here, with glaciers bridged the headland gaps, There, flung her snows into the mountain laps; Push'd the pale fountains down the stony fells, And brimm'd with inland seas the nether dells; And tossing verdure up and down the wild, Exultant on her glorious chaos smiled! Charm'd land! yet dearer to my longing heart Our own wild North, its humble counterpart. More dear for bliss and anguish, and the sake Of that lorn grave by Grasmere's beauteous lake.— O vale Elysian, and ye bosky nooks Of Rydal, and thou pride of mountain-brooks, Thou Rotha, linking with thy sonorous chain Of argent, three Lake Naiads who sustain A threefold mirror, where the wood-crown'd rocks And ferny mountains sleek their shagged locks. O haunts romantic, how could you betray? And thou perfidious blossom-kirtled May, What had I done to win thy smiling hate, And make the loveliest of the months my fate? Already had my mother sunk in death, Kill'd by the sweet caresses of thy breath. She, too, died young; and I remember well, Child as I was, her beauty's healing spell; And how her angel-smile could soften down, To my young heart, a sterner parent's frown. False May! I loved thee much and hate thee more, How could I trust thy smile so false before? 'Neath the close texture of thy flowery woof Our blest seclusion seem'd disaster-proof. Never did bland insidious beauty lure Like thine the soul to dreams of peace secure; As when thine evil-eye the signal gave, That doom'd Jemima to her early grave! Time files away in every human heart The points acute of sorrow's barbed dart; Twelve years have pass'd, and their balsamic wings Have fann'd my bosom and appeased its stings. But she, whose spirit hover'd in the skies, Could she oblivious be of earthly ties? Oh, no; if ever nuptial love was true, Not time alone, but she consoled me too. I've seen her oft in solitude and night, And she has o'er me waved a wand of light; Cheer'd by her smile when fainting on my way, I've seen her in the broad unconscious day; Have heard her whispers, soft as dreams of song, Clear through the tumult of the human throng. Her spirit, though beatified, unchanged In nature, proved the woman not estranged. A surge-tost voyager on Biscay's bay, I've seen her rise resplendent from the spray. In Cintra's palace, in that ancient hall, Where pomps heraldic blaze along the wall, Brydges, of thee, her sire, I mused and sigh'd In mood censorious of thy lordly pride, And fond solicitude of jealous birth That earth should glitter o'er its kindred earth. Sudden her voice arose in soft reproof From tesselated floor to pillar'd roof; Back on my heart the meek remonstrance fell, And hush'd the censure with its filial spell. Where curved Mondego rolls through Coimbra's plains I read the tenderest of Camoens' strains; By that famed rock where Inez' fountain flows, And letter'd marble breathes in verse her woes. A well-known form was near me when I read, And tears were gushing from the spectral dead; Griefs snatch'd by genius from the urn of years, Drew tears that fell into “the Fount of Tears.” Thus still she haunts me wheresoe'er I roam, And cheats my exile with the ghost of home. One eve, again in Cintra's charmed bourne, Land of enchantment even for those that mourn, Midway I loiter'd up the craggy steep, Where myrtles bloom, where infant fountains leap; Where the rich orange blends its flower and food, And rugged cork trees dwell on rocks as rude. In that dread humour of the prostrate mind When plaintless grief is but despair resign'd, Lorn as I sate, beside the Afric bath, She glided by me up the mountain-path! Impell'd, I follow'd where the vision led, Clad as she was in raiment of the dead. On the tall peak she linger'd in her shroud, 'Tween Earth and Heaven like a silver cloud. When near I drew, with watchful look upraised, With eyes refulgent on the peak she gazed, A crag with lichens stain'd and hoary moss, And on its centre stood a reverend Cross! One moment from my visionary guide The type of mercy drew my glance aside, And she had vanish'd! I was all alone On the grey summit of that pile of stone; Below, the sea expanded from the beach, The Cross of Marble stood within my reach— Emblems august for wretches that despond, Salvation near, Eternity beyond! ELEGY ON A YOUNG LADY WHO DIED AT TORQUAY, FEB. 2, 1833. We weep with soften'd grief the aged dead; When the young die more bitter tears we shed: We quiver when the shroud-wrapt sleeper wears Rich glossy locks instead of thin white hairs. Does startled Pity chide, then, His decree, Who said to Marian's soul, “Return to me?” Alas! we mourn in impotence, we rave In ignorance and folly o'er the grave! 'Tis selfish guilt to grieve for one so good, Though summon'd in the bloom of womanhood. Yet if so good, so modest, pure and kind, The harder lot for those she leaves behind: Her thoughts reflected all things fresh and fair; Why so soon broken was that mirror rare? Why was so just a standard thus denied To our observance? We have lost a guide. Again we question, and in sin demur In sorrow for ourselves lamenting her. But Mercy, sentient to each human tear, Forgives, perhaps, what Wisdom frowns to hear. It was so lately in the month of June— June's leafy month, when birds were all in tune, All sweetest flowers in blossom, all sweet words, Pure as those flowers, and blithesome as those birds, Mingling in gay confusion in the bowers Of Bronsil, haunt of children's happiest hours— It was so lately that I saw her first, Where tender minds were by her virtues nurst; There I beheld her to all hearts endear'd, And fresh in health as the young plants she rear'd. It was more lately, in the harvest moon, I last beheld her, to be mourn'd so soon! Her cheek was mantled with a floral bloom,— Perfidious roses, blossoms of the tomb. A few short weeks; the bland breath of Torbay Play'd on her brow as treacherous breezes play. A few weeks yet—she sleeps on Devon's shore The sleep that never shall be broken more, Till the dread voice of Judgment cries, “Behold! How on your lives has her remembrance told? In vain your words bewail'd her laid in earth, Unless your deeds exemplified her worth.” TO THE CITY OF FLORENCE. Florence—in my waking dream, Arch'd with rays through tears of gladness, Spanning Arno's famous stream— Florence, thou hast lost the gleam, The bow of Promise fades in sadness. For me no more shall Fancy's fingers Trace on Arno's silver sands Names of heaven-inspired singers; Painters old whose spirit lingers On the wonders of their hands; Lords of art who gave to marble Form and voice and love divine, Faith that sceptics cannot garble,— Seraphs, iris-wing'd, that warble Round the Medicean Shrine. Nought but clouds on fancy thicken From thy once alluring vale, Where our northern blossoms sicken, Where the hope of love lay stricken, And the mother's heart grew pale. Where my friend, an English stranger, Had his dearest heart-strings wrench'd— Italy! thou smiling danger, Could thy breath so darkly change her? Can that loveliest light be quench'd? When will Time this memory harden? Florence, what to me art thou? What but a forbidden garden, By a dread angelic warden,— Asrael of the placid brow,— Guarded with a flaming sword, On whose sky-wrought blade is scored One bright name, too bright for me, And that name is “Emily.” LINES COMPOSED IN THE ENGLISH BURIAL-GROUND AT OPORTO. I wear a smile upon my lip, I teach my voice a careless tone, My cup of woe I lightly sip, Nor let its harsh contents be known. I will not droop to worldly eyes As if my grief their pity craves, Though here I breathe my lonely sighs, Within this solemn field of graves. For mine are woes that dwell apart, And human sympathy reject; Too sacred to the jealous heart To seek compassion's cold respect. But when such shades as these I find, Where nature fondly smiles on death, It checks the pulse, and soothes the mind To humour sorrow's plaintive breath. Praised be the hand whose skill contrived To make a Golgotha so fair; While nature at the fraud connived, And lent her robe for death to wear. Within this pensive place of trees, This green elysium for the dead, If I might now my fancy please I'd choose my own sepulchral bed. I think my spirit less forlorn Would feel, if it were certain now That when my heart should cease to mourn 'Twould sleep beneath a greenwood bough. Vain fancy! can religion draw No thoughts of healthier sorrow bred, No life of death from nature's law, Within this garden sown with dead? That in due season every seed, However deeply hid it lie, Will yet come up a flower or weed, Is seen by faith's prophetic eye. Weeds only are we all, alas; But hence, by Christ's transforming power, No weed so mean but it may pass Through death to life and be a flower. DIALOGUE WITH THE DEPARTING SPIRIT OF A FRIEND'S CHILD. “Emily, thou fair white child, Whither goest thou, Smiling as thy father smiled When he kiss'd thy brow? “Thou art yet too young to roam, Tell me, maiden, whither?” “I but go from home to home, Hence ascending—thither: (Heavenward with those light clear eyes Glancing, she replied:) “I go yonder to the skies, Marian my guide.” “Where is Marian, fair child?” (Still she look'd above:) “Waiting yonder with her mild Cheering face of love.” “Think how lone will Anna be— How forlorn thy brother— Wilt thou from thy father flee? Wilt thou leave thy mother?” (Downward then she look'd awhile Troubled and afraid; But with arch and radiant smile Soon look'd up and said:) “Yes, 'tis but one more good night— And when God gives warning, They will find me in the light Of eternal morning.” A DREAM OF DEATH AT SEA. Under the gannet's pillow Twenty fathoms deep, Under the dull green billow Of Finisterre I sleep. Be kind to my two young daughters For the sake of him who sends This voice from beneath the waters To all who were his friends. By Grasmere's Lake their mother Rests among the dead; Their father has found another And a wilder bed. Be the ban of a father's spirit, On those who would do them wrong! And a blessing may they inherit Who are kind to his orphan young! The Night of New Year's Eve, 1826. STANZAS. [The clouds of wintry yesterday are gone] The clouds of wintry yesterday are gone; The blue of Heaven is pale with light to-day; Bright shines the morn as ever morning shone In southern vallies, in the month of May. Green meadows bask beneath me; all around Are mountains brow'd with diadems of snow; And Rotha dances with a silvery sound, At play with sunbeams, to the lake Windermere. below. Fair scene and sunny sabbath! why this tear? Alas, it is not Rydal Vale I see, Nor Rotha's spring-tide music that I hear, Nor Fairfield's crown of snow that shines for me. Granada's circled plain is at my feet; Her mountains The Alpine range called Sierra Nevada, overlooking the City and Vega (plain) of Granada. their eternal snows reveal; And myrtled Darro The Darro rises from the hill of myrtles, near Huetar, and approaches Granada under the Monte Sacro. The walks on both sides of this swift arrowy river are delicious. The Darro flows into the Xenil (pronounced Heneel with the h strongly aspirated—some write it Genil) below the Carrera, one of the Alamedas or public walks of Granada. The Xenil rises in the glaciers of the Sierra Nevada, and discharges itself, far away, at Ecija, into the Guadalquiver. flashes down to greet And mingle yonder with the soft Xenil. And lo! the magic palace of the Moor, The red Alhambra haunted by Romance; And Dora, spell-bound by delight as pure As ever trembled in a woman's glance. Hark to the nightingales! they throng their lays; Not one, but hundreds This is no extravagance: the groves on the banks of the Darro and Xenil are peopled with nightingales, and the effect of their choirs of harmony in May is indescribable. hail the poet's child. O what a day was that! Of Sabbath days The most divine that ever hope beguiled. Strange contrast to the sound of Sabbath bells, That woodland music heard in Moslem halls! Yet to her heart of holier things it tells, And dearer harmonies of prayer recalls. And where was Dora after one short year, When flowers exhaled the May's delicious breath? Not yet, not yet, on her untimely bier, But living, conscious, in the arms of Death. That fatal illness began before Christmas, 1846, hardly six months after our return from Spain. In April, 1847, all hope was over, and she knew it! She expired on Friday, the 9th of July. O flowers of Rydal, could ye bloom again! The last her mortal eyes were doom'd to see Were roses clustering at her lattice pane, The blossoms from her brother's funeral tree. The rose-tree that climbs up the front wall of Rydal Mount to the windows of the room where she breathed her last, was planted there in memorial of her brother Thomas's death, and is called Thomas's tree. Ere three-score suns and ten, from May-day morn, Had risen and set on Rydal's laurell'd height, The radiant spirit which of Heaven was born,— For us too precious, wing'd to Heaven her flight. When thrice the folds in Grasmere Vale had yean'd, Mr. Wordsworth died in April, 1850, not quite three years after the loss of his beloved daughter, and was buried by her side in Grasmere churchyard. And April daisies bloom'd upon her grave, A life broke down that would on hers have lean'd; And sire to daughter, dust to dust, we gave. In these loved haunts, where all things have a voice That echoes to the bard's inspiring tongue, Where woods and waters in his strain rejoice, “And not a mountain lifts its head unsung,” Of Him the Tarns and Meres are eloquent; The running waters are his chroniclers; The eternal mountains are his monument.— A few frail hearts and one green mound are hers. Rydal, Sunday, February 2nd, 1851. ALONE. Alone! no stir nor sound of life; The house to day is all my own: And where art thou, my peerless wife? Alas, alone. All joyous things are out among The flowers, this April morn so fair. And thou, whose heart was ever young, Art where, oh where? A nest is in thy holly-tree, A red-breast chants amid the leaves; The same that used to sing to thee On winter eves. The sunbeams through the casement peep And glint along thy chamber floor; What seek they here? thy morning sleep They break no more. A year ago so shone the spring Where faint my blighted love was lying; The buds could bloom, the birds could sing, When thou wert dying. The river on Helvellyn born Runs, clear as at the fountain-head, Beside my door—as on the morn When thou wert dead. But with another voice it calls, A greeting to my soul address'd, Borne hither from the churchyard walls That guard thy rest. O keen intolerable sense Of solitude in hopeless woe! I will arise and bear me hence, But whither go? Ah whither but to yonder knoll, So green beneath the dark yew-bough? Whereof this river to my soul Is murmuring now. For thou art there, and thoughts are there That dwell not on less holy ground; The lakeland knows no spot so fair As that green mound. There standing, where I saw or heard The earth upon thy coffin thrown: I feel, so near my home deferr'd, Not all alone. April, 1848. THE END.</field>
