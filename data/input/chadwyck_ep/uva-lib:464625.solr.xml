      <field name="fulltext">PSAL. I. [1] That man hath perfect blessednes who walketh not astray In counsel of ungodly men, nor stands in sinners way, Nor sitteth in the scorners chair. 2But placeth his delight Upon Gods Law, and meditates on his Law day and night. 3He shall be like a tree that growes near planted by a river, Which in his season yeelds his fruit, and his leaf fadeth never; And all he doth shal prosper well. 4The wicked are not so: But like they are unto the chaff which winde drives to and fro. 5In judgement therfore shal not stand such as ungodly are, Nor in th'assembly of the just shall wicked men appear. 6For why? the way of Godly men unto the Lord is known: Whereas the way of wicked men shal quite be over-thrown. PSAL. II. [1] Why rage the Heathen? and vain things why do the people mind? 2Kings of the earth do set themselvs, and Princes are combinde To plot against the Lord, and his Anointed, saying thus, 3Let us asunder break their bands, and cast their cords from us 4He that in Heaven sits shall laugh: the Lord shall scorn them all: 5Then shal he speak to th? in wrath, in rage he vex them shal, 6Yet notwithstanding I have him to be my King appointed: And over Sion, my holy hill, I have him King anointed. 7The sure decree I will declare: the Lord hath said to me, Thou art mine onely Son, this day I have begotten thee. 8Ask of me, and for heritage the Heathen I'le make thine, And for possession I to thee will give earths utmost line. 9Thou shalt, as with a weightie rod of iron, break them all, And, as a potters sheard, thou shalt them dash in pieces small. 10Now therefore, Kings, be wise, be taught ye Judges of the earth. 11Serve God in fear, and see that ye joyn trembling with your mirth. 12Kisse ye the Son, lest in his ire ye perish from the way, If once his wrath begin to burn. Blest all that on him stay. PSAL. III. [1] O Lord, how are my foes increas'd against me many rise. 2Many say of my soul, for him in God no succour lyes. 3Yet thou my shield, and glory art, th'uplifter of mine head. 4I cry'd, and from his holy hill the Lord me answer made. 5I laid me down, and slept, I wak'd, for God sustained me. 6I will not fear though thousands ten set round against me be. 7Arise, O Lord, save me, my God; for thou my foes hast stroke All on the cheek-bone; and the teeth of wicked men hast broke. 8Salvation doth appertain, unto the Lord alone: Thy blessing, Lord, for evermore thy people is upon. PSAL. IV. [1] Give ear unto me when I call, God of my righteousnesse: Have mercy, hear my pray'r, thou hast enlarged me in distresse. 2O ye the sons of men, how long will ye love vanities? How long my glory turn to shame, and will ye follow lies? 3But know that for himself, the Lord the godly man doth chuse: The Lord, when I on him do call, to hear wil not refuse. 4Fear, &amp; sin not, talk with your heart on bed, and silent be. 5Offrings present of righteousnesse: and in the Lord trust ye. 6O who will show us any good? is that which many say: But of thy countenance the light, Lord, lift on us alway. 7Upon my heart, bestow'd by thee more gladnesse I have found, Then they ev'n then, when corn &amp; wine did most with them abound. 8I will both lay me down in peace, and quiet sleep will take: Because thou onely, me to dwel in safetie, Lord, dost make. PSAL. V. [1] Give ear unto my words, O Lord, my meditation weigh. 2Hear my loud cry, my King, my God; for I to thee will pray. 3Lord, thou shalt early hear my voice; I early will direct My pray'r to thee, and looking up an answer wil expect. 4For thou art not a God that doth in wickednesse delight: Neither shall evil dwel with thee. 5Nor fooles stand in thy sight. All that ill-doers are thou hat'st. 6Cut'st off that liars be: The bloudy and deceitful man abhored is by thee. 7But I into thy house wil come in thine abundant grace: And I will worship in thy fear toward thy holy place. 8Because of those mine enemies, Lord, in thy righteousnes Do thou me lead; do thou thy way make straight before my face. 9For in their mouth there is no truth, their inward part is ill: Their throat's an open sepulchre, their tongue doth flatter still. 10O God destroy them; let them be by their own counsel quell'd: Them for their many sinnes cast out, for they 'gainst thee rebell'd, 11But let all joy that trust in thee; and stil make shouting noise: For them thou sav'st: Let all that love thy Name, in thee rejoyce. 12For, Lord, unto the righteous man thou wilt thy blessing yeeld; With favour thou wilt compasse him about, as with a shield. PSAL. VI. [1] Lord in thy wrath rebuke me not, Nor in thy hot rage chasten me. 2Lord pity me, for I am weak: Heal me, for my bones vexed be. 3My soul is also vexed sore: But, Lord, how long stay wilt thou make? 4Return, O Lord, my soul set free: O save me for thy mercies sake. 5Because those that deceased are, Of thee shall no remembrance have: And who is he that will to thee Give praises lying in the grave? 6I with my groaning weary am, I also all the night, my bed Have caused for to swim, and I With tears my couch have watered. 7Mine ey consum'd with grief grows old Because of all mine enemies. 8Hence from me wicked workers all For God hath heard my weeping crys. 9God hath my supplication heard; My pray'r received graciously. 10Sham'd, &amp; sore vex'd be all my foes, Sham'd and back-turned suddenly. Another of the same. [In thy great indignation] In thy great indignation, O Lord, rebuke me not; Nor on me lay thy chastning hand in thy displeasure hot. 2Lord, I am weak, therefore on me have mercy, and me spare: Heal me, O Lord, because thou knowst my bones much vexed are. 3My soul is vexed fore; but, Lord, how long stay wilt thou make? 4Return, Lord, free my soul, and save me for thy mercies sake. 5Because of thee in death there shall no more remembrance be: Of those that in the grave do ly, who shal give thanks to thee? 6I with my groaning weary am, and all the night my bed I caused for to swim: with tears my couch I watered. 7By reason of my vexing grief, mine eye consumed is; It waxeth old, because of all that be mine enemies. 8But now depart from me, all ye that work iniquity; For why, the Lord hath heard my voice when I did mourn and cry. 9Unto my supplication the Lord did hearing give: When I to him my prayer make, the Lord will it receive. 10Let all be sham'd, &amp; troubled sore that enemies are to me; Let them turn back, and suddenly ashamed let them be. PSAL. VII. [1] O Lord my God, in thee do I my confidence repose; Save and deliver me from all my persecuting foes. 2Lest that the enemy my soul should like a Lion tear, In pieces renting it, while there is no deliverer. 3O Lord my God, if it be so that I committed this; If it be so, that in my hands iniquity there is. 4If I rewarded ill to him that was at peace with me: (Yea, ev'n the man that without cause my foe was, I did free.) 5Then let the foe persue, and take my soul, and my life thrust Down to the earth, and let him lay mine honour in the dust. 6Rise in thy wrath, Lord, raise thyself for my foes raging be: And to the judgement, w?? thou hast commanded, wake for me. 7So shall th'assembly of thy folk about encompasse thee: Thou therefore for their sakes, return unto thy place on hie. 8The Lord he shal the people judge: my judge, Jehovah, be, After my righteousnesse, and mine integrity in me. 9O Let the wickeds malice end, but stablish stedfastly The righteous: for the righteous God the hearts and reins doth try. 10In God, who saves th'upright in heart, is my defence and stay. 11God just men judgeth, God is wroth with ill men every day. 12If he do not return again, then He his sword wil whet; His bow he hath already bent, and hath it ready set. 13He also hath for him prepar'd the instruments of death; Against the persecutors he his shafts ordained hath. 14Behold, he with iniquity doth travail as in birth; A mischief he conceived hath, and falshood shal bring forth. 15He made a pit and digg'd it deep, another there to take, But he is fal'n into the ditch which he himself did make. 16Upon his own head, his mischief shall be returned home; His violent dealing also down on his own pate shall come. 17According to his righteousnesse the Lord I'le magnifie: And will sing praise unto the Name of God, that is most hie. PSAL. VIII. [1] How excellent in all the earth, Lord, our Lord, is thy Name! Who hast thy glory far advanc'd above the starrie frame. 2From infants &amp; from sucklings mouth thou didest strength ordain, For thy foes cause, that so thou mightst th'avenging foe restrain. 3When I look up unto the heavens, which thine own fingers fram'd Unto the moon, and to the starres, which were by thee ordain'd; 4Then say I, what is man, that he remembred is by thee? Or what the son of man, that thou so kind to him should be? 5For thou a little lower hast him then the angels made, With glory and with dignity thou crowned hast his head. 6Of thy hand works thou madst him Lord; all under's feet didst lay: 7All sheep and oxen, yea, and beasts that in the field do stray: 8Fowls of the air, fish of the sea, all that passe through the same. 9How excellent in all the earth, Lord, our Lord, is thy Name! PSAL. IX [1] Lord, thee I'le praise with al my heart, thy wonders all proclaim. 2In thee, most high, I'le greatly joy, and sing unto thy Name. 3When back my foes were turnd, they fel, and perisht at thy sight. 4For thou maintain'd my right and cause, on throne sat'st, judging right. 5The heathen thou rebuked hast, the wicked over thrown; Thou hast put out their names, that they may never more be known: 6O enemy! now destrustions have an end perpetual: Thou cities raz'd, perisht with them is their memorial. 7God shall endure for ay: he doth for judgement set his throne: 8In righteousnesse to judge the world justice to give each one. 9God also will a refuge be for those who are opprest; A refuge will he be in times of trouble to distrest. 10And they that know thy Name, in thee their confidence will place: For thou hast not forsaken them that truly seek thy face. 11O sing ye praises to the Lord, that dwels in Sion hill: And all the nations among, his deeds record ye still. 12When he enquireth after blood, he then remembreth them: The humble folk he not forgets that call upon his Name. 13Lord, pitie me, behold the grief which I from foes sustain, Ev'n thou who fr? the gates of death dost raise me up again? 14That I, in Sions daughters gates, may all thy praise advance: And that I may rejoyce alwayes in thy deliverance. 15The heathen are sunk in the pit, which they themselves prepar'd: And in the net which they have hid their own feet fast are snar'd. 16The Lord is by the judgement known which he himself hath wrought: The sinners hands do make the snares wherewith themselves are caught. 17They who are wicked, into hell, each one shall turned be, And all the nations that forget to seek the Lord most hie. 18For they that needy are, shall not forgotten be alway: The expectation of the poor shall not be lost for ay. 19Arise, Lord, let not man prevail, judge heathens in thy sight. 20That they may know themselves but men, the nations, Lord, affright. PSAL. X. [1] Wherefore is it, that thou, O Lord dost stand from us afar? And wherefore hidest thou thy self, when times so troublous are? 2The wicked in his loftinesse doth persecute the poor: In these devices they have fram'd let them be taken sure. 3The wicked of his hearts desire doth talk with boasting great; He blesseth him that's covetous, whom yet the Lord doth hate. 4The wicked, throgh his pride of face on God he doth not call; And in the counsels of his heart the Lord is not at all. 5His wayes at all times griveous are; thy judgements from his sight Removed are: at all his foes he puffeth with despight. 6Within his heart he thus hath said, I shall not moved be: And no adversity at all shall ever come to me. 7His mouth with cursing, fraud, deceit, is fill'd abundantly: And underneath his tongue, there is mischief and vanity. 8He closely sits in villages: he slayes the innocent: Against the poor that passe him by his cruel eyes are bent. 9He Lyon-like lurks in his den: he waits the poor to take: And when he draws him in his net, his prey he doth him make. 10Himself the humbleth very low, he croucheth down withall, That so a multitude of poor may by his strong ones fall. 11He this hath said within his heart, the Lord hath quite forgot: He hides his countenance, and he for ever sees it not. 12O Lord, do thou arise; O God, lift up thine hand on hie: Put not the meek afflicted ones out of thy memorie. 13Why is it that the wicked man thus doth the Lord despise? Because, that God wil it require, he in his heart denies. 14Thou hast it seen, for thei mischief and spite thou wilt repay: The poor commits himself to thee, thou art the orphans stay. 15The arm break of the wickedman, and of the evil one: Do thou seek out his wickednesse until thou findest none. 16The Lord is King through ages all ev'n to eternity: The heathen people from his land are perisht utterly. 17O Lord, of those that humble are thou the desire didst heare: Thou wilt prepare their heart, &amp; thou to hear wilt bend thine eare: 18To judge the fatherlesse, and those that are oppressed sore, That man, that is but sprung of earth may them oppresse no more. PSAL. XI. [1] I in the Lord do put my trust: how is it then that ye Say to my soul, flee as a bird unto your mountain hie? 2For lo, the wicked bend their bow, their shafts on string they fit: That those who upright are in heart they privily may hit. 3If the foundations be destroy'd, what hath the righteous done? 4God in his holy Temple is, in heaven is his throne: His eyes do see, his eye lids try 5mens sons. The just he proves: But his soul hates the wicked man, and him that violence loves. 6Snares, fire and brimstone, furious storms on sinners he shal rain; This, as the portion of their cup, doth unto them pertain. 7Becaus the Lord most righteous doth in righteousnesse delight, And with a pleasant countenance beholdeth the upright. PSAL. XII. [1] Help Lord, because the godly man doth dayly fade away; And from among the sons of men the faithful do decay. 2Unto his neighbour every one doth utter vanitie: They with a double heart do speak, and lips of flatterie. 3God shall cut off all flatering lips' tongues that speak proudly, thus, 4We'l w?? our tongue prevail, our lips are ours: who's Lord ov'r us? 5For poor opprest, and for the sighs of needie, rise will I, Saith God, and him in safety set from such as him defy. 6The words of God are words most pure: they be like silver try'd In earthen furnace, seven times that hath been purify'd. 7Lord, thou shalt them preserve and keep for ever, from this race. 8On each sidewalk the wicked, when vile men are high in place. PSAL. XIII. [1] How long wilt thou forget me, Lord shal it for ever be? O how long shal it be, that thou wilt hide thy face from me? 2How long take counsel in my soul, stil sad in heart, shal I? How long exalted over me shall be mine enemy? 3O Lord my God, consider wel, and answer to me make: Mine eyes enlighten, lest the sleep of death me over take. 4Lest that mine enemie should say, against him I prevail'd; And, those that trouble me, rejoyce when I am mov'd and fail'd. 5But I have all my confidence thy mercy set upon: 5My heart within me shal rejoyce in thy salvation. 6I wil unto the Lord my God sing praises chearfully, Because he hath his bountie shown to me abundantly. PSAL. XIV. [1] That there is not a God, the fool doth in his heart conclude: They are corrupt, their works are vile, not one of them doth good. 2Upon mens sons the Lord fr? heaven did cast his eyes abroad; To see if any understood, and did seek after God. 3They altogether filthy are, they all aside are gone: And there is none that doeth good, yea, sure there is not one. 4These workers of iniquity do they not know at all, That they my people eat as bread, and on God do not cal? 5There fear'd they much: for God is with the whole race of just. 6You shame the counsel of the poor, because God is his trust. 7Let Israels help from Sion come. When back the Lord shal bring His captives, Jacob shal rejoyce, and Israel shal sing. PSAL. XV. [1] Within thy tabernacle, Lord, who shal abide with thee? And in thy high and holy hil who shal a dweller be? 2The man that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousnesse, And, as he thinketh in his heart, so doth he truth expresse. 3Who doth not slander with his tongue, nor to his friend doth hurt, Nor yet against his neighbour doth take up an ill report. 4In whose eyes vile men are dispis'd; but those that God do fear He honoureth: and changeth not, though to his hurt he swear. 5His coyn puts not to usury, nor take reward wil he Against the guiltlesse. Who doth thus shal never moved be. PSAL. XVI. [1] Lord, keep me: for I trust in thee. 2To God thus was my speech, Thou art my Lord, and unto thee my goodnesse doth not reach: 3To saints on earth, to th'excellent where my delight's all plac't. 4Their sorrows shal be multipli'd, to other gods that haste: Of their drink-offerings of blood I will no offering make, Yea, neither I their very names up in my lips will take. 5God is of mine inheritance and cup the portion: The lot that fallen is to me, thou dost maintain alone. 6Unto me happily the lines in pleasant places fell; Yea, the inheritance I got, in beautie doth excel. 7I blesse the Lord, because he doth by counsel me conduct: And in the seasons of the night, my reins do me instruct. 8Before me still the Lord I set: sith it is so, that he Doth ever stand at my right hand, I shal not moved be. 9Because of this my heart is glad, and joy shal be exprest Ev'n by my glory: and my flesh in confidence shal rest. 10Because my soul in grave to dwel shal not be left by thee; Nor wilt thou give thine Holy One corruption to see. 11Thou wilt me shew the path of life of joyes there is ful store Before thy face, at thy right hand are pleasures evermore. PSAL. XVII. [1] Lord, hear the right, attend my cry, unto my pray'r give heed, That doth not in hyprocrisie from feigned lips proceed. 2And from before thy presence forth my sentence do thou send: Toward these things that equal are, do thou thine eyes intend. 3Thou prov'dst mine heart, thou visitdst me, by night thou didst me try, Yet nothing fo?dst, for that my mouth shal not sin purpos'd I. 4As for mens works, I by the word that from thy lips doth flow Did me preserve out of the paths wherein destroyers go. 5Hold up my goings, Lord: me guide in those thy paths divine, So that my footsteps may not slide out of these wayes of thine. 6I called have on thee, O God, because thou wilt me hear: That thou may'st hearken to my speech, to me incline thine ear. 7Thy wondrous loving kindnes show thou that by thy right hand Sav'st them that in thee trust, from those, that up against them stand. 8As th'apple of the eye me keep; in thy wings shade me close, 9From lewd oppressours, compassing me round, as deadly foes. 10In their own fat they are inclos'd: their mouth speaks loftily. 11Our steps they compast; &amp; to ground down bowing set their eye. 12He like unto a lion is, that's greedy of his prey, Or lion young, which lurking doth in secret places stay. 13Arise, and disappoint my foe, and cast him down, O Lord: My soul save from the wicked man, the man which is thy sword. 14From men which are thy hand, O Lord, from wordly men, me save, Which onely in this present life their part and portion have: Whose belly with thy treasure hid thou fill'st, they children have In plentie, of their goods the rest they to their children leave. 15But as for me, I thine own face in righteousnesse will see: And with thy likenesse, when I wake, I satisfi'd shal be. PSAL. XVIII. [1] Thee wil I love, O Lord, my strength 2My fortresse is the Lord, My rock, and he that doth to me deliverance afford: My God, my strength, wh? I wil trust, a bukler unto me, The horn of my salvation and my high towr is he. 3Upon the Lord, who worthy is of praises, will I cry: And then shall I preserved be safe from mine enemy. 4Floods of ill men affrighted me. deaths pangs about me went. 5Hells sorrows me environed: deaths snares did me prevent. 6In my distresse I call'd on God, cry to my God did I: He from his temple heard my voice, to his ears came my cry. 7Th'earth, as affrighted, then did shake, trembling upon it seised; The hills foundations moved were, because he was displeased. 8Up from his nostrils came a smoke, and from his mouth there came Devouring fire, and coals by it were turned into flame. 9He also bowed down the heav'ns, and thence he did descend And thickest clouds of darknesse did under his feet attend. 10And he upon a cherube rode, and thereon he did fly: Yea, on the swift wings of the winde his flight was from on hy. 11He darkness made his secret place: about him for his tent Dark waters were, and thickest clouds of th'airie firmament. 12And at the brightnesse of that light which was before his eye, His thick clouds past away, hail-stons and coals of fire did flye. 13The Lord God also in the heav'ns did thunder in his ire, And there the highest gave his voice, hail-stones and coals of fire. 14Yea, he his arrows sent abroad, and them he scattered: His lightnings also he shot out, and them discomfited. 15The waters chanels then were seen the worlds foundations vast At thy rebuke discovered were, and at thy nostrils blast. 16And from above the Lord sent down and took me from below, From many waters he me drew, which would me over-flow. 17He me reliev'd from my strong foes and such as did me hate: Because he saw that they for me too strong were, and too great. 18They me prevented in the day of my calamitie: But even then the Lord himself a stay was unto me. 19He to a place where libertie and room was, hath me brought: Because he took delight in me, he my deliverance wrought. 20According to my righteousnesse he did me recompence, He me repay'd according to my hands pure innocence. 21For I Gods wayes kept, fr? my God did not turn wickedlie. 22His judgements were before me, I his Lawes put not from me. 23Sincere before him was my heart, with him upright was I: And watchfully I kept my self from mine iniquity. 24After my righteousnesse the Lord hath recompensed me, After the cleannesse of my hands appearing in his eye. 25Thou gracious to the gracious art, to upright men upright. 26Pure to the pure, froward thou kythes unto the froward wight. 27For thou wilt the afflicted save, in grief that low do ly: But wilt bring down the countenance of them whose looks are hy. 28The Lord wil light my candle so, that it shal shine ful bright. The Lord my God wil also make my darknesse to be light. 29By thee through troups of men I break, and them discomfit all; And, by my God assisting me, I over-leap a wal. 30As for God, perfect is his way: the Lord his word is try'd: He is a buckler to al those who do on him confide. 31Who but the Lord is God? but he who is a rook and stay? 32It's God that girdeth me with strength, &amp; perfect maks my way. 33He made my feet swift as the hinds armes set me on my high places: 34Mine hands to war he taught, mine brake bows of steel in pieces. 35The shield of thy salvation thou didst on me bestow: Thy right hand held me up, and great thy kindnesse made me grow. 36And in my way, my steps thou hast enlarged under me, That I go safely; and my feet are kept from sliding free. 37Mine enemies I pursued have, and did them over-take. Nor did I turn again, til I an end of them did make. 38I wounded them, they could not rise they at my feet did fal. 39Thou girdest me with strength for war; my foes thou brought down al. 40And thou hast giv'n to me the necks of all mine enemies: That I might them destroy and slay who did against me rise. 41They cryed out, but there was none that would or could them save. Yea, they did cry unto the Lord, but he no answer gave. 42Then did I beat them smal, as dust before the winde that flyes: And I did cast them out like dirt upon the street that lyes. 43Thou mad'st me free from peoples strife; and heathens head to be: A people whom I have not known, shal service do to me. 44At hearing they shal me obey, to me they shal submit. 45Strangers for fear shal fade away, who in close places sit. 46God lives, blest be my rocks the God of my health praised be. 47God doth avenge me, and subdues the people under me. 48He saves me from mine enemies: Yea, thou hast lifted me Above my foes: and from the man of violence, setst me free. 49Therefore to thee wil I give thanks the heathen folk among: And to thy Name, O Lord, I wil sing praises in a song. 50He great deliverance gives hisking. he mercy doth extend To David, his anointed one, and his seed without end.

And there is nothing from his heat, that hidden doth remain. 7Gods Law is perfect, and converts the soul in sin that lyes; Gods testimony is most sure, and makes the simple wise. 8The statutes of the Lord are right, and do rejoyce the heart; The Lords command is pure, &amp; doth light to the eyes impart. 9Unspotted is the fear of God, and doth endure for ever; The judgements of the Lord are true, and righteous altogether. 10They, more then gold, yea, much fine gold, to be desired are; Then honey, from the honey comb that dropeth, sweeter far. 11Moreover, they thy servant warn how he his life should frame; A great reward provided is for them that keep the same. 12Who can his errours understand? O cleanse thou me within 13From secret faults. Thy servant keep from all presumptuous sin. And do not suffer them to have dominion over me; Then righteous and innocent I from much sin shal be. 14The words w? from my mouth proceed, the thoughts sent from my heart Accept, O Lord, for thou my strength and my redeemer art.

Reproach of men I am, and by the people am dispis'd. 7All that me see laugh me to scorn: shoot out the lip do they, They nod &amp; shake their heads at me, and mocking, thus do say, 8This man did trust in God, that he would free him by his might; Let him deliver him, sith he had in him such delight. 9But thou art he out of the womb that didst me safely take; When I was on my mothers breasts, thou me to hope didst make. 10And I was cast upon thy care, ev'n from the womb til now; And from my mothers belly, Lord, my God and guide art thou. 11Be not far off, for grief is near; and none to help is found. 12Buls many compasse me; strong buls of Bashan me surround. 13Their mouths they op'ned wide on me, upon me gape did they, Like to a Lion ravening and roaring for his prey. 14Like water I'm pour'd out, my bones all out of joynt do part: Amidst my bowels, as the wax, so melted is my heart. 15My strength is like a potsherd dri'd: my tongue it cleaveth fast Unto my jaws; and to the dust of death thou brought me hast. 16For dogs have compast me about: the wicked, that did meet In their assembly, me inclos'd, they pierc'd my hands and feet. 17I all my bones may tell: they do upon me look and stare. 18Upon my vesture lots they cast, and clothes among them share. 19But be not far, O Lord, my strength; haste to give help to me. 20From sword my soul, from pow'r of dogs my darling set thou free 21Out of the roaring Lions mouth do thou me shield and save: For from the horns of Unicorns an ear to me thou gave. 22I will shew forth thy Name unto those that my brethren are: Amidst the congregation thy praise I wil declare. 23Praise ye the Lord, who do him fear; him glorifie, all ye The seed of Jacob; fear him all that Isra'ls children be. 24For he despis'd not, nor abhor'd th'afflicteds misery: Nor from him hid his face, but heard when he to him did cry. 25Within the congregation great my praise shall be of thee: My vows before them that him fear shall be perform'd by me. 26The meek shal eat, and shalbe fil'd; they also praise shal give Unto the Lord that do him seek; your heart shal ever live. 27All ends of th'earth remember shal, and turn the Lord unto; All kindreds of the nations to him shal homage do. 28Because the Kingdom to the Lord doth appertain, as his: Likewise among the nations the governour he is. 29Earth, fat ones eat &amp; worship shal: all who to dust descend Shal bow to him: none of them can his soul from death defend. 30A seed shal service do to him, unto the Lord it shal Be for a generation reck'ned in ages all. 31They shal come, &amp; they shal declare his truth and righteousnesse Unto a people yet unborn, and that he hath done this.

[1] To thee I'le cry, O Lord, my rock, hold not thy peace to me; Lest, like those that to pit descend, I by thy silence be. 2The voice hear of my humble pray'rs, when unto thee I cry; When to thy holy Oracle I lift mine hands on by. 3With ill men draw me not away, that work iniquity; That speak peace to their friends while in their hearts doth mischiefly. 4Give them according to their deeds, and ills endeavoured; And, as their handie-works deserve, to them be rendered 5God shal not build, but th? destroy who would not understand The Lords own works, nor did regard the doing of his hand. 6For ever blessed be the Lord, for graciously he heard The voice of my petitions, and prayers did regard. 7The Lord's my strength and shield, my heart upon him did rely, And I am helped, hence my heart doth joy exceedingly, And with my song I will him praise. 8Their strength is God alone: He also is the saving strength of his anointed One. 9O thine own people do thou save, blesse thine inheritance: Them also do thou feed, and them for evermore advance. PSAL. XXIX. [1] Give ye unto the Lord, ye sons that of the mighty be, All strength and glory to the Lord, with cheerfulnesse give ye. 2Unto the Lord the glory give, that to his Name is due; And in the beautie of holinesse, unto Jehovah bow. 3The Lords voice on the waters is; the God of Majestie Doth thunder, and on multitudes of waters sitteth He. 4A powrfull voice it is, that comes out from the Lord most hie; The voice of that great Lord is full of glorious majestie. 5The voice of the Eternall doth asunder cedars tear; Yea, God the Lord doth cedars break that Lebanon doth bear. 6He makes them like a calf to skip: ev'n that great Lebanon, And like to a young unicorn the mountain Sirion. 7Gods voice divides the flames of fire; 8The desert it doth shake; The Lord doth make the wildernesse of Kadesh, all to quake. 9Gods voice doth make the hindes to calve; it makes the forrests bare: And in his Temple every one his glory doth declare. 10The Lord sits on the flouds; the Lord sits King, and ever shall. 11The Lord wil give his people strength, and with peace blesse them all. PSAL XXX. [1] Lord, I will thee extoll, for thou hast lifted me on hie, And over me thou to rejoyce mad'st not mine enemie. 2O thou who art the Lord my God, I in distresse to thee With loud cryes lifted up my voice, and thou hast healed me. 3O Lord, my soul thou hast brought up and rescu'd from the grave: That I to pit should not go down, alive thou didst me save. 4O ye that are his holy ones, sing praise unto the Lord; And give unto him thanks, when you his holinesse record. 5For, but a moment lasts his wrath; life in his favour lyes: Weeping may for a night endure, at morn doth joy arise. 6In my prosperitie, I said, that nothing shal me move. 7O Lord, thou hast my mountain made to stand strong by thy love: But when that thou, O gracious God, didst hide thy face from me, Then quickly was my prosperous state turn'd into miserie. 8Wherefore unto the Lord, my cry I caused to ascend: My humble supplication, I to the Lord did send. 9What profit is there in my bloud, when I go down to pit? Shall unto thee the dust give praise? thy truth declare shall it? 10Hear, Lord, have mercy, help me Lord 11From me thou turn'd my sadnes, To dancing; yea, my sakcloth loos'd, and girded me with gladnesse. 12That sing thy praise my glory may, and never silent be; O Lord my God, for evermore I will give thanks to thee. PSAL. XXXI. [1] In thee, O Lord, I put my trust, sham'd let me never be: According to thy righteousnesse, do thou deliver me. 2Bow down thine ear to me, with speed send me deliverance; To save me, my strong rock be thou, and my house of defence. 3Because thou art my rock, and thee I for my fortresse take; Therefore do thou me lead and guide, ev'n for thine own Names sake. 4And sith thou art my strength, therefore pull me out of the net, Which they in subtiltie for me so privily have set. 5Into thine hands, I do commit my sp'rit: for thou art he, O thou Jehovah, God of truth, that hast redeemed me. 6Those that do lying vanities regard, I have abhorr'd: But as for me, my confidence is fixed on the Lord. 7I'le in thy mercy gladly joy: for thou, my miseries Considered hast; thou hast my soul known in adversities; 8And thou hast not inclosed me within the enemies hand; And by thee have my feet been made in a large room to stand. 9O Lord, upon me mercy have, for trouble is on me; Mine eye, my belly, and my soul with grief consumed be. 10Because my life with grief is spent, my years with sighs and grones: My strength doth fail; and for my sin consumed are my bones. 11I was a scorn to all my foes, and to my friends a fear: And specially reproacht of those that were my neighbours near When they me saw, they from me fled 12Ev'n so, I am forgot, As men are out of minde, when dead: I'm like a broken pot. 13For slanders I of many hear'd, fear compast me, while they Against me did consult and plot, to take my life away. 14But as for me, O Lord my trust, upon thee I did lay: And I to thee, thou art my God, did confidently say. 15My times are wholly in thine hand: do thou deliver me From their hands, that mine enemies and persecuters be. 16Thy countenance to shine, do thou upon thy servant make: Unto me give salvation, for thy great mercies sake. 17Let me not be asham'd, O Lord, for on thee call'd I have: Let wicked men be asham'd, let them be silent in the grave. 18To silence put the lying lips: that grievous things do say, And hard reports, in pride and scorn, on righteous men do lay. 19How great's the goodnes thou for th? that fear thee keepst in store; And wroughtst for th? that trust in the the sons of men before! 20In secret of thy presence, thou shalt hide them from mans pride Fr? strife of tongus, thou closely shalt as in a tent, them hide. 21All praise &amp; thanks be to the Lord; for he hath magnify'd His wondrous love to me, within a city fortify'd. 22For from thine eyes cut off I am, (I in my haste had said) My voice yet heardst thou, when to thee with cryes, my moan I made. 23O love the Lord, all ye his saints: because the Lord doth guard The faithfull, and he plenteously proud doers doth reward. 24Be of good courage, and he strength unto your heart shall send, All ye whose hope and confidence doth on the Lord depend. PSAL. XXXII. [1] O blessed is the man, to whom is freely pardoned All the transgression he hath done, whose sin is covered. 2Blest is the man, to whom the Lord imputeth not his sin, And in whose sp'rit there is no guile nor fraud is found therein. 3When as I did refrain my speech, and silent was my tongue, My bones then waxed old, because I roared all day long. 4For, upon me both day and night, thine hand did heavie ly, So that my moisture turned is in summers drought thereby. 5I thereupon have unto thee my sin acknowledged, And likewise mine iniquitie, I have not covered: I will confesse unto the Lord my trespasses, said I; And of my sin, thou freely didst forgive th'iniquity. 6For this, shal every godly one, his prayer make to thee, In such a time he shall thee seek, as found thou mayest be Surely, when floods of waters great, do swel up to the brim, They shal not over-whelm his soul, nor once come near to him. 7Thou art my hiding-place, thou shalt from trouble keep me free; Thou, with songs of deliverance, about shalt compasse me, 8I will instruct thee, and thee teach the way that thou shalt go, And, with mine eye upon thee set, I will direction show. 9Then be not like the horse or mule which do not understand: Whose mouth, lest they come near to thee a bridle must command. 10Unto the man that wicked is, his sorrows shal abound: But him that trusteth in the Lord, mercy shall compasse round. 11Ye righteous, in the Lord be glad, in him do ye rejoyce: All ye that upright are in heart, for joy lift up your voyce. PSAL. XXXIII. [1] Ye righteous in the Lord rejoyce: it comely is, and right, That upright men with thankful voyce should praise the Lord of might. 2Praise God with harp: and unto him, sing with the psalterie, Upon a ten-string'd instrument make ye sweet melodie. 3A new song to him sing, and play with loud noise skilfully. 4For, right is Gods word, all his works are done in verity. 5To judgement and to righteousnesse a love He beareth stil: The loving kindnesse of the Lord the earth throughout doth fil. 6The heavens by the word of God, did their begining take; And by the breathing of his mouth, He all their hosts did make. 7The waters of the seas He brings together as an heap: And in store-houses, as it were, He layeth up the depth. [8]Let earth, and all that live therein, with reverence fear the Lord: Let all the worlds inhabitants dread him with one accord. 9For he did speak the word, and done it was, without delay; Established, it firmly stood what ever he did say. 10God doth the counsel bring to nought, which heathen folk do take: And what the people do devise, of none effect doth make. 11O! but the counsel of the Lord, doth stand for ever sure, And of his heart the purposes, from age to age endure. 12That nation blessed is, whose God Jehovah is: and those A blessed people are, whom for his heritage he chose. 13The Lord fr? heav'n sees, &amp; beholds all sons of men ful wel. 14He views all fr? his dewlling place that in the earth do dwel. 15He formes their hearts alike: and all their doings he observes. 16Great hosts save not a King: much strength, no mighty man preserves. 17An horse for preservation, is a deceitful thing: And by the greatnesse of his strength, can no deliverance bring. 18Behold, on those that do him fear, the Lord doth set his eye: Ev'n those, who on his mercy do with confidence rely. 19Fr? death to free their soul, in dearth life unto them to yeeld. 20Our soul doth wait upon the Lord: he is our help and shield. 21Sith in his holy Name we trust, our hearts shal joyful be. 22Lord, let thy mercy be on us, as we do hope in thee. PSAL. XXXIV. [1] God wil I bless all times: his praise my mouth shal stil expresse. 2My soul shal boast in God: the meek shal hear with joyfulnesse. 3Extol the Lord with me, let us exalt his name together. 4I sought the Lord, he heard, and did me from all fears deliver. 5They look'd to him, &amp; lightned were; not shamed were their faces. 6This poor man cry'd, God heard, &amp; sav'd him from all his distresses. 7The angel of the Lord encamps, and round encompasseth All those about that do him fear, and them delivereth. 8O taste and see, that God is good: who trusts in him is blest. 9Fear God his saints: none that him fear shal be with want opprest 10The lions young may hungry be. and they may lack their food: But they that truly seek the Lord, shal not lack any good. 11O children, hither do ye come, and unto me give ear: I shal you teach to understand how ye the Lord should fear. 12What man is he that life desires, to see good would live long? 13Thy lips refrain fr? speaking guile, and from ill words thy tongue. 14Depart from ill, do good; seek peace pursue it earnestly. 15Gods eyes are on the just; his ears are open to their cry. 16The face of God is set against those that do wickedly. That he may quite out from the earth cut off their memory. 17The righteous cry unto the Lord, he unto them gives ear; And they, out of their troubles all, by him delivered are. 18The Lord is ever nigh to them that be of broken sp'rit: To them he safety doth afford, that are in heart contrite. 19The troubles that afflict the just, in number many be: But yet at length, out of them all, the Lord doth set them free. 20He carefully his bones doth keep, what ever can befal: That not so much as one of them can broken be at all. 21Ill shal the wicked slay: laid waste shal be, who hate the just. 22The Lord redeems his servants souls. none perish that him trust. PSAL. XXXV. [1] Plead, Lord, w?? those that plead, and fight with those that fight w?? me. 2Of shield &amp; buckler take thou hold, stand up mine help to be, 3Draw also out the spear, and do against them stop the way, That me persue: unto my soul, I'm thy salvation, say. 4Let them confounded be, &amp; sham'd, that for my soul have sought: Who plot my hurt, turn'd back be they and to confusion brought. 5Let them be like unto the chaff, that flies before the winde: And let the angel of the Lord pursue them hard behinde. 6With darknes cover thou their way, and let it slipperie prove, And let the angel of the Lord pursue them from above. 7For, without cause have they for me their net hid in a pit, They also have without a cause, for my soul digged it. 8Let ruine seise him unawares, his net he hid withal Himself let catch: and in the same destruction let him fall. 9My soul in God shal joy: and glad in his salvation be. 10And all my bones shal say, O Lord, who is like unto thee, Which dost the poor set free from him that is for him too strong; The poor and needy from the man that spoils and does him wrong? 11False witnesses rose; to my charge things I not knew they laid. 12They, to the spoiling of my soul, me ill for good repay'd. 13But as for me, when they were sick, in sackcloth sad I mourn'd: My humbled soul did fast, my pray'r into my bosome turn'd, 14My self I did behave, as he had been my friend, or brother: I heavily bow'd down, as one that mourneth for his mother. 15But in my trouble they rejoyc'd, gathering themselves together: Yea, abjects vile, together did themselves against me gather; I knew it not, they did me tear, and quiet would not be. 16With mocking hypocrites, at feasts they gnasht their teeth at me. 17How long, Lord, lookst thou on? fr? those destructions they intend, Rescue my soul, from lions young, my darling do defend. 18I wil give thanks to thee, O Lord, within th'assembly great: And, where much people gathered are, thy praises forth wil set. 19Let not my wrongful enemies proudly rejoyce ov'r me: Nor, who me hate without a cause, let them wink with the eye. 20For peace they do not speak at all: but craftie plots prepare Against all those within the land, that meek and quiet are. 21With mouths set wide, they 'gainst me said, Ha, ha, our eye doth see. 22Lord, thou hast seen, hold not thy peace: Lord, be not far from me 23Stir up thy self; wake, that thou mayst judgement to me afford: Ev'n to my cause, O thou that art my onely God and Lord. 24O Lord my God, do thou me judge after thy righteousnes, And let them not their joy 'gainst me triumphantly expresse. 25Nor let th? say within their hearts, ah, we would have it thus; Nor suffer them to say, that he— is swallowed up by us. 26Sham'd and confounded be they all that at my hurt are glad: Let those against me that do boast, with shame and scorn be clad. 27Let th? that love my righteous cause be glad, shout, and not cease To say, the Lord be magnify'd, who loves his servants peace. 28Thy righteousnesse shal also be declared by my tongue, The praises that belong to thee, speak shal it all day long. PSAL. XXXVI. [1] The wicked mans transgression, within my heart thus sayes, Undoubtedly the fear of God is not before his eyes. 2Because himself she flattereth in his own blinded eye, Untill the hatefulnesse be found of his iniquity. 3Words fr? his mouth proceeding, are fraud and iniquity: He to be wise, and to do good, hath left off utterly. 4He mischief, lying on his bed, most cunningly doth plot, He sets himself in wayes not good; ill he abhorreth not. 5Thy mercy, Lord, is in the heaven; thy truth doth reach the clouds. 6Thy justice is like mountains great; thy judgements deep as flouds; Lord thou preservest man and beast. 7How precious is thy grace! Therefore, in shadow of thy wings, mens sons their trust shal place. 8They, with the fatnesse of thy house, shall be wel satisfi'd: From rivers of thy pleasures, thou wilt drink to them provide. 9Because of life the fountain pure remains alone with thee: And in that purest light of thine, we clearly light shal see. 10Thy loving kindnesse unto them continue that thee know; And still on men upright in heart, thy righteousnes bestow. 11Let not the foot of cruel pride come, and against me stand: And let me not removed be, Lord, by the wickeds hand. 12There fall'n are they, and ruined, that work iniquities: Cast down they are, and never shal be able to arise. PSAL. XXXVII. [1] For evil doers fret thou not thy self, unquietly, Nor do thou envy bear to those that work iniquity. 2For, even like unto the grasse, soon be cut down shal they, And, like the green and tender herb, they wither shal away. 3Set thou thy trust upon the Lord, and be thou doing good. And so thou in the land shalt dwel, and verily have food. 4Delight thy self in God, hee'l give thine hearts desire to thee. 5Thy way to God commit, him trust, it bring to passe shall he. 6And, like unto the light, he shal thy righteousnesse display, And hethy judgement shal bring forth like noon-tide of the day. 7Rest in the Lord, and patiently wait for him: do not fret For him, who prospering in his way, successe in sin doth get. 8Do thou from anger cease, and wrath see thou forsake also: Fret not thy self in any wise, that evil thou should do. 9For, those that evil doers are, shal be cut off and fal: But those that wait upon the Lord, the earth inherit shal. 10For, yet a little while, and then the wicked shal not be: His place thou shalt consider wel, but it thou shalt not see. 11But, by inheritance, the earth the meek ones shal possesse: They also shal delight themselves in an abundant peace. 12The wicked plots against the just, and at him whets his teeth. 13The Lord shal laugh at him, because his day he coming seeth. 14The wicked have drawn out the sword, and bent their bow, to slay The poor and needy, and to kil men of an upright way. 15But their own sword, which they have drawn, shal enter their own heart, Their bows, w?? they have bent, shall break, and into pieces part. 16A little that a just man hath, is more, and better far Then is the wealth of many such as lewd and wicked are. 17For sinners arms shal broken be: but God the just sustains. 18God knows the just mans dayes, &amp; their heritage remains. 19They shal not be asham'd, wh? they stil the evil time do see: And when the dayes of famine are, they satisfi'd shal be. 20But wicked men, and foes of God, as fat of lambs decay, They shal consume; yea, into smoke they shal consume away. 21The wicked borrows, but the same again he doth not pay: Whereas the righteous mercy shows, and gives his own away. 22For such as blessed be of him, the earth inherit shal; And, they that cursed are of him, shal be destroyed all. 23A good mans footsteps by the Lord are ordered aright: And, in the way wherein he walks, he greatly doth delight. 24Although he fal, yet shal he not be cast down utterly: Because the Lord with his own hand upholds him mightily. 25I have been young &amp; now am old: yet have I never seen The just man left, nor that his seed for bread have beggers been. 26He's ever merciful, and lends: his seed is blest therefore. 27Depart from evil, and do good: and dwel for evermore. 28For God loves judgement, and his saints leaves not in any case, They are kept ever: but cut off shal be the sinners race. 29The just inherit shall the land, and ever in it dwel. 30The just mans mouth doth wisdom speak: his tongue doth judgement tel. 31In's heart the Law is of his God, his steps slide not away. 32The wicked man doth watch the just, and seeketh him to slay. 33Yet him the Lord, wil not forsake, nor leave him in his hands, The righteous wil he not condemn, when he in judgement stands. 34Wait on the Lord, and keep his way, and thee exalt shal he, Th'earth to inherit: when cut off the wicked thou shalt see. 35I saw the wicked great in pow'r: spread like a green bay-tree. 36He past, yea, was not: him I sought, but found he could not be. 37Mark thou the perfect, and behold the man of uprightnesse: Because that surely of this man the latter end is peace. 38But those men that transgressors are shal be destroy'd together, The latter end of wicked men shal be cut off for ever. 39But the salvation of the just is from the Lord above, He, in the time of their distresse, their stay &amp; strength doth prove: 40The Lord shal help, &amp; them deliver He shal them free and save From wicked men, because in him their confidence they have. PSAL. XXXVIII. [1] In thy great indignation, O Lord, rebuke me not: Nor on me lay thy chastning hand, in thy displeasure hot. 2For in me fast thine arrows stick, thine hand doth presse me sore. 3And in my flesh there is no health nor soundnesse any more. This grief I have, because thy wrath is forth against me gone: And in my bones there is no rest, for sin that I have done. 4Because, gone up above mine head my great transgressions be: And, as a weightie burden, they too heavy are for me. 5My wounds do stink, and are corrupt: my folly makes it so: 6I troubled am, &amp; much bow'd down; all day I mourning go. 7For a disease that loathsome is, so fills my loins with pain, That in my weak and wearie flesh no soundnesse doth remain. 8So feeble and infirm am I, and broken am so sore; That through disquiet of my heart, I have been made to roare. 9O Lord, all that I do desire, is stil before thine eye: And of my heart the secret groans not hidden are from thee. 10My heart doth pant uncessantly, my strength doth quite decay: As for mine eyes, their wonted sight is from me gone away. 11My lovers and my friends do stand at distance from my sore: And those do stand aloof, that were kinsmen, and kind before. 12Yea, they that seek my life, lay snares: who seek to do me wrong Speak things mischievous, &amp; deceits imagine all day long. 13But, as one deaf, that heareth not, I suffered all to passe: I as a dumb man did become, whose mouth not op'ned was. 14As one that hears not, in whose mouth are no reproofs at all. 15For, Lord, I hope in thee, my God, thou'lt hear me when I call 16For I said hear me lest they should rejoyce ov'r me, with pride: And ov'r me magnifie themselves, when as my foot doth slide. 17For, I am near to halt, my grief is stil before mine eye. 18For I'le declare my sin; and grieve for mine iniquity. 19But yet mine enemies lively are, and strong are they beside: And, they that hate me wrongfully, are greatly multipli'de 20And, they for good that render ill, as enemies me withstood: Yea, ev'n for this, because that I do follow what is good. 21Forsake me not, O Lord: my God, far from me never be. 22O Lord, thou my salvation art, haste to give help to me. PSAL. XXXIX. [1] I said, I wil look to my wayes, lest with my tongue I sin: In sight of wicked men my mouth with bridle I'le keep in. 2With silence, I as dumb became, I did my self restrain From speaking good, but th? the more increased was my pain. 3My heart within me waxed hot, and while I musing was, The fire did burn &amp; from my tongue these words I did let passe. 4Mine end, and measure of my daies, O Lord, unto me show What is the same: that I thereby, my frailtie well may know. 5Lo, thou my dayes an hand-breadth mad'st, mine age is in thine eye As nothing: sure each man at best is wholly vanity. 6Sure, each man walks in a vain show: they vex themselves in vain: He heaps up wealth, and doth not know to whom it shall pertain. 7And now, O Lord, what wait I for? my hope is fix'd on thee. 8Free me from all my trespasses, the fools scorn make not me. 9Dumb was I, opening not my mouth, because this work was thine. 10Thy stroke take from me: by the blow of thine hand, I do pine. 11When with rebukes thou dost correct man, for iniquity, Thou wastes his beauty like a moth: sure each man's vanity. 12Attend my cry, Lord, at my tears, and prayr's not silent be. I sojourn as my fathers all, and stranger am with thee. 13O spare thou me, that I my strength recover may again, Before from hence I do depart, and here no more remain. PSAL. XL. [1] I waited for the Lord my God, and patiently did bear: At length to me he did incline my voice and cry to hear. 2He took me from a fearfull pit, and from the myrie clay, And on a rock he set my feet, establishing my way. 3He put a new song in my mouth, out God to magnify: Many shal see it, and shal fear, and on the Lord rely. 4O blessed is the man whose trust upon the Lord relies: Respecting not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies. 5O Lord my God, ful many are the wonders thou hast done; Thy gracious thoughts, to us-ward, far above all thoughts, are gone: In order none can reckon them to thee: if them declare, And speak of them I would, they moe then can be numbred are. 6No sacrifice, nor offering didst thou at all desire, Mine ears thou bor'd: sin offring thou, and burnt, didst not require, 7Then to the Lord, these were my words, I come, behold and see: Within the volume of thy Book, it written is of me: 8To do thy wil I take delight, O thou my God that art: Yea, that most holy Law of thine, I have within my heart. 9Within the congregat on great I righteousnesse did preach: Lo, thou dost know, O Lord, that I refrained not my speech. 10I never did within my heart conceal thy righteousnesse: I thy salvation have declar'd, and shown thy faithfulnesse: Thy kindnesse, which most loving is, concealed have not I, Nor from the congregation great have hid thy verity. 11Thy tender mercies, Lord, from me O do thou not restrain: Thy loving kindnesse, and thy truth, let them me stil maintain. 12For ills, past reck'ning, compasse me. and mine iniquities Such hold upon me taken have, I cannot lift mine eyes: They more then hairs are on mine head, thence is my heart dismaid. 13Be pleased, Lord, to rescue me: Lord, hasten to mine aid. 14Sham'd and confounded be they all that seek my soul to kil: Yea, let them backward driven be, and sham'd that wish me ill. 15For a reward of this their shame, confounded let them be, That in this manner scoffing say, Aha, ahah, to me. 16In thee let all be glad, and joy, who seeking thee abide: Who thy salvation love, say still, the Lord be magnifi'd. 17I'm poor and needy, yet the Lord of me a care doth take: Thou art my help and Saviour, my God, no tarrying make. PSAL. XLI. [1] Blessed is he that wisely doth the poor mans case consider; For, when the time of trouble is, the Lord will him deliver. 2God wil him keep; yea, save alive, on earth he blest shall live: And to his enemies desire, thou wi't him not up-give. 3God will give strength, when he on bed of languishing doth mourn: And in his sicknesse sore, O Lord, thou all his bed wil turn. 4I said, O Lord, do thou extend thy mercie unto me; O do thou heal my soul, for why, I have offended thee. 5Those that to me are enemies, of me do evil say: When shall he die, that so his name may perish quite away? 6To see if he comes, he speaks vain words; but then his heart Heaps mischief to it, which he tels, when forth he doth depart. 7My haters, joyntly whispering, 'gainst me my hurt devise. 8Mischief, say they, cleaves fast to him: he lieth, and shal not rise. 9Yea, ev'n mine own familier friend, on whom I did rely, Who ate my bread, ev'n he his heel against me lifted hie. 10But, Lord, be merciful to me, and up again me raise, That I may justly them requite according to their wayes. 11By this I know, that certainly I favoured am by thee: Because my hatefull enemy triumphs not over me. 12But as for me, thou me upholdest in mine integrity: And, me before tht countenance thou setst continually. 13The Lord, they God of Israel, be blest for ever then, From age to age eternally. Amen, yea, and amen. PSAL. XLII. [1] Like as the hart for water-brooks in thirst doth pant and bray; So pants my longing soul, O God, that come to thee I may. 2My soul for God, the living God, doth thirst, when shall I near Unto thy countenance approach, and in Gods sight appear? 3My tears have unto me been meat, both in the night and day, While unto me continually, Where is thy God, they say? 4My soul is poured out in me, when this I think upon; Because that with the multitude I heretofore had gone: With them into Gods house I went, with voice of joy and praise, Yea, with the multitude, that kept the solemn holy dayes. 5O why art thou cast down my soul, why in me so dismaid? Trust God, for I shall praise him yet, his countenance is mine aid. 6My God, my soul's cast down in me: thee therefore minde I wil From Jordans land, the Hermonites, and ev'n from Mizar hil. 7At the noise of thy water spouts, deep unto deep doth call. Thy breaking waves passe over me, yea, and thy billows all. 8His loving kindnesse yet the Lord command wil in the day, His song's with me by night to God, by whom I live, I'le pray 9And I wil say to God, my rock, why me forgets thou so? Why for my foes oppression, thus mourning do I go? 10It's as a sword within my bones, when my foes me upbraid: Ev'n when by them, Where is thy God, it's daily to me said? 11O why art thou cast down, my soul? why, thus with grief opprest? Art thou disquieted in me? in God stil hope and rest; For yet I know I shal him praise, who graciously to me The health is of my countenance, yea, mine own God is he. PSAL. XLIII.

For th'enemies oppression, why do I mourning go? 3O send thy light forth, &amp; thy truth let them be guides to me, And bring me to thine holy Hill, ev'n where thy dwellings be. 4Then will I to Gods altar go, to God my chiefest joy: Yea, God, my God, thy name to praise my harp I will employ. 5Why art thou then cast down my soul? what should discourage thee? And why, with vexing thoughts, art thou disquieted in me? Still trust in God, for him to praise good cause I yet shall have; He of my countenance is the health, my God that doth me save. PSAL. XLIV. [1] O God, we with our ears have heard, our fathers have us told, What works thou in their dayes hadst done, ev'n in the dayes of old. 2Thy hand did drive the Heathen out, and plant them in their place; Thou didst afflict the nations, but them thou didst encrease. 3For neither got their sword the land nor did their arm them save: But thy right hand, arm, countenance; for, thou them favour gave. 4Thou art my King: for Jacob, Lord deliverances command 5Through thee, we shall push down our foes that do against us stand: We through thy Name, shall tread down those that risen against us have. 6For in my bow I shal not trust, nor shall my sword me save. 7But, from our foes thou hast us sav'd our haters put to shame. 8In God we all the day do boast, and ever praise thy Name. 9But now we are cast off by thee, and us thou purst to shame; And, when our armies do go forth, thou go'st not with the same. 10Thou mak'st us from the enemie, faint-hearted, to turn back: And they, who hate us, for themselves our spoils away do take. 11Like sheep for meat thou gavest us: 'mong Heathen cast we be. 12Thou didst for nought thy people sell, their price enrich'd not thee. 13Thou mak'st us a reproach to be unto our neighbours near; Derision, and a scorn to them that round about us are. 14A by-word also thou dost us among the Heathen make: The people, in contempt and spite, at us their heads do shake. 15Before me my confusion continually abides; And, of my bashfull countenance, the shame me ever hides. 16For voice of him that doth reproach, and speaketh blasphemie: By reason of th'avenging foe, and cruell enemie. 17All this is come on us; yet we. have not forgotten thee, Nor falsely in thy Covenant behav'd our selves have we. 18Back from thy way our heart not turn'd: our steps no straying made: 19Though us thou breakst in dragons place, &amp; coverest with deaths shade 20If we Gods Name forgot, or streacht: to a strange god our hands: 21Shal not God search this out? for he hearts secrets understands. 22Yea, for thy sake, we're kill'd all day counted as slaughter sheep. 23Rise, Lord, cast us not ever off, awake, why dost thou sleep 24O wherefore hidest thou thy face? forgetst our case distrest, 25And our oppression? For our soul is to the dust down prest; Our belly also on the earth, fast cleaving, hold doth take. 26Rise for our help, and us redeem, ev'n for thy mercies sake, PSAL. XLV.

Another of the same. [My heart enditing is] My heart enditing is good matter in a song: I speak the things that I have made which to the King belong: My tongue shal be as quick his honour to endite, As is the pen of any scribe that useth fast to write. 2Thou'rt fairest of all men, grace in thy lips doth flow: And therefore blessings evermore on thee doth God bestow. 3Thy sword gird on thy thigh, thou that art most of might: Appear in dreadful Majestie, and in thy glory bright. 4For meeknesse, truth and right, ride prosperously in state: And thy right hand shal teach to thee things terrible and great. 5Thy shafts shal pierce their hearts that foes are to the King: Whereby into subjection the people thou shalt bring. 6Thy royal seat, O Lord, for ever shal remain: The scepter of thy Kingdom doth all righteousnesse maintain. 7Thou loves right, and hates ill: for God, thy God most hie, Above thy fellows hath with th'cyl of joy anointed thee. 8Of mirrhe and spices sweet a smell thy garments had: Out of thy ivorie palaces, whereby they made thee glad. 9And in thy glorious train, Kings daughters waiting stand: And thy fair queen, in Ophit gold, doth stand at thy right hand. 10O daughter, take good heed, incline, and give good ear; Thou must forget thy kindred all, and fathers house most dear. 11Thy beautie to the King, shall then delightful be: And, do thou humbly worship him, because thy Lord is he. 12The daughter then of Tyre there with a gift shal be, And all the wealthy of the land shall make their sute to thee. 13The daughter of the King all glorious is within; And, with embroyderies of gold, her garments wrought have bin. 14She cometh to the King in robes with needle wrought: The virgins that do follow her shal unto thee be brought. 15They shal be brought with joy, and mirth on every side, Into the palace of the King, and there they shall abide. 16And, in thy fathers stead, thy children thou may'st take, And, in all places of the earth, them noble Princes make. 17I will show forth thy name to generations all: Therefore thy people evermore to thee give praises shall. PSAL. XLVI. [1] God is our refuge, and our strength in straits a present aid. 2Therfore, although the earth remove we will not be afraid, Though hills amidst the Sea be cast, 3Though waters roaring make, And troubled be; yea, though the hills by swelling seas do shake. 4A river is, whose streams do glad the City of our God: The holy place wherein the Lord most high hath his abode. 5God in the midst of her doth dwel: nothing shall her remove: The Lord to her an helper wil, and that right early prove. 6The Heathen rag'd tumultuously, the Kingdoms moved were: The Lord God uttered his voyce, the earth did melt for fear. 7The Lord of hosts upon our side doth constantly remain: The God of Jacob's our refuge, us safely to maintain. 8Come, &amp; behold what wondrous works have by the Lord been wrought: Come, see what desolations he on the earth hath brought. 9Unto the ends of all the earth wars into peace he turns; The bow he breaks, the spear he cuts, in fire the chariot burns. 10Be still, and know that I am God; among the Heathen I Will be exalted, I on earth will be exalted, hie. 11Our God, who is the Lord of hosts, is still upon our side; The God of Jacob our refuge for ever will abide. PSAL. XLVII. [1] All people clap your hands, to God with voice of triumph shout. 2For dreadful is the Lord most high, great King, the earth throughout. 3The heathen people under us he surely shall subdue: And he shal make the Nations under our feet to bow. 4The lot of our inheritance choose out for us shall he, Of Jacob whom he loved well, ev'n the excellencie. 5God is with shouts gone up, the Lord with trumpets sounding hie; 6Sing praise to God, sing praise, sing praise praise to our King sing ye. 7For, God is King of all the earth, with knowledge praise expresse. 8God rules the nations, God sits on his throne of holinesse. 9The princes of the people are assembled willinglie, Ev'n of the God of Abraham they who the people be. For why, the shields that do defend the earth, are only his: They to the Lord belong, yea He exalted greatly is. PSAL. XLVIII.

In our Gods City, which his hand for ever stablish will. 9We, of thy loving kindnesse thought, Lord, in thy Temple still. 10O Lord, according to thy Name, through all the earth's thy praise And thy right hand, O Lord, is full of righteousnesse alwayes. 11Because thy judgements are made known let Sion mount rejoyce; Of Judah let the daughters all send forth a chearfull voice. 12Walk about Sion, and go round, the high towres thereof tell: 13Consider ye her palaces, and mark her bulwarks well, That ye may tel posteritie. 14For this God doth abide Our God for evermore, he will ev'n unto death us guide.

My heart shal knowledge meditate, 4I will incline mine ear To parables, and on the harp my sayings dark declare. 5A midst those dayes, that evill be, why should I, fearing, doubt? When of my heels th'iniquitie shall compasse me about. 6Who e're they be that in their wealth their confidence do pitch, And boast themselves; because they are become exceeding rich. 7Yet none of these his brother can redeem by any way, Nor can he unto God, for him sufficient ransome pay; 8(Their souls redemption precious is, and it can never be) 9That still he should for ever live, and not corruption see. 10For why? he seeth that wise men die, and brutish fools also Do perish, &amp; their wealth, when dead, to others they let go. 11Their inward thought is, that their house and dwelling places shal Stand through all ages; they their lands by their own names do call. 12But yet in honour shal not man abide continually; But passing hence may be compar'd unto the beasts that dy. 13Thus, brutish folly plainly is their wisedome, and their way; Yet, their posterity approve what they do fondly say. 14Like sheep, they in the grave are laid, and death shal them devour; And, in the morning, upright men shall over them have pow'r: Their beautie, fr? their dwelling, shal consume within the grave. 15But, from hells hand God will mee free, for he shall me receive. 16Be thou not then afraid, when one enriched thou dost see, Nor when the glory of his house advanced is on hie. 17For, he shal carry nothing hence, when death his dayes doth end; Nor shal his glory after him into the grave descend. 18Although he his own soul did bless whilst he on earth did live, (And when thou to thy self dost well, men will thee prayses give) 19He to his fathers race shal go, they never shal see light. 20Man honour'd, wanting knowledge, is like beasts that perish quite.

And, fith my words behinde thy back thou casts, and dost reject. 18When thou a thief didst see, with him thou didst consent; And with the vile adulterers partaker on thou went. 19Thou giv'st thy mouth to ill, thy tongue deceit doth frame; 20Th? sits, &amp; 'gainst thy brother speakst thy mothers son does shame. 21Because I silence kept, while thou these things hast wrought; That I was altogether like thy self, hath been thy thought: Yet I will thee reprove, and set before thine eyes In order ranked thy misdeeds, and thine iniquities. 22Now, ye that God forget, this carefully consider; Lest I in pieces tear you all, and none can you deliver. 23Who so doth offer praise, me glorifies, and I Will shew him Gods salvation, that orders right his way.

Before him fire shal wast, great storms shall compasse him about. 4He, to the heavens from above, and to the earth below Shall call, that He his judgement may before his people show. 5Let all my saints together be unto me gathered, Those, that by sacrifice, with me a covenant have made 6And then the heavens shal declare His righteousnesse abroad: Because the Lord himself doth come, none else is judge but God. 7Hear, O my people, and I'le speak: O Israel by name, Against thee I wil testifie, God, ev'n thy God I am. 8I, for thy sacrifices few, reprove thee never wil; Nor for burnt-offrings to have been before me offred still. 9I'le take no bullock, nor hee-goats from house, nor folds of thine: 10For, beasts of forrests, cartel all on thousand hils, are mine. 11The fowls are all to me wel known that mountains high do yeeld; And I do challenge as mine own, the wilde beasts of the field. 12If I were hungry, I would not to thee for need complain; For earth, and all its fulnesse, doth to me of right pertain. 13That I, to eat the flesh of buls take pleasure, dost thou think? Or, that I need to quench my thirst, the bloud of goats to drink? 14Nay, rather unto me, thy God, thanksgiving offer thou, To the most high perform thy word, and fully pay thy vow. 15And, in the day of trouble great, see that thou call on me; I will deliver thee, and thou my Name shalt glorifie, 16But, God unto the wicked saith, why should thou mention make Of my commands? how dar'st thou in thy mouth my covenant take? 17Sith it is so, that thou dost hate all good instruction; And sith thou casts behinde thy back, and slights my words eachone. 18Wh? thou a thief didst see, then straight thou joyn'd with him in sin; And, with the vile adulterers, thou hast partaker bin. 19Thy mouth to evill thou dost give, thy tongue deceit doth frame, 20Thou first, &amp; 'gainst thy brother speak'st thy mothers son to shame. 21These things thou wickedly hast done, and I have silent bin; Thou thought that I was like thy self, and did approve thy sin: But I will sharply thee reprove, and I will order right, Thy sins and thy transgressions in presence of thy sight. 22Consider this, and be afraid, ye that forget the Lord, Lest I in pieces tear you all, when none can help afford. 23Who offereth praise me glorifies: I wil shew Gods salvation To him that ordereth aright his life, and conversation.

For God his bones that thee besieg'd hath scattered all abroad, Thou hast confounded them, for they dispised are of God. 6Let Israels help from Sion come.

O for thy truths sake cut them off, and sweep them clean away. 6I wil a sacrifice to thee give with free willingnesse: Thy Name, O Lord, because it's good with praise I wil confesse. 7For he hath me delivered from all adversities: And his desire mine eye hath seen upon mine enemies.

O God, with indignation, down do thou the people throw. 8My wandrings al what they have been thou know'st, their number took. Into thy bottle put my tears, are they not in thy book? 9My foes shal, when I cry, turn back, I know't, God is for me. 10In God his word I'le praise, his word in God shal praised be. 11In God I trust, I wil not fear what man can do to me. 12Thy vows upon me are, O God: I'le render praise to thee. 13Wilt thou not, who fr? death me sav'd my feet from fals keep free, To walk before God in the light of those that living be.

[1] My God, deliver me from those that are mine enemies: And do thou me defend from those that up against me rise. 2Do thou deliver me from them that work iniquity; And give me safety from the man of bloudy cruelty. 3For lo, they for my soul lay wait; the mighty do combine Against me, Lord, not for my fault, nor any sin of mine. 4They run, and without fault in me themselves do ready make: Awake to meet me with thy help, and do thou notice take. 5Awake therefore, Lord God of hosts thou God of Israel, To visit Heathen al: spare none that wickedly rebel. 6At ev'ning they go to and fro; they make great noise, and sound Like to a dog, and often walk about the city round. 7Behold, they belch out with their mouth, and in their lips are swords: For they do say thus, who is he that now doth hear our words? 8But thou, O Lord, shalt laugh at th?, and al the Heathen mock. 9While he's in power I'le wait on thee: for God is my high rock. 10He of my mercy that is God, betimes shal me prevent: Upon mine enemies God shal let me see mine hearts content. 11Them slay not, lest my folk forget; but scatter, them abroad By thy strong powr; and bring them down O thou our shield, and God. 12For their mouths sin, &amp; for the words that from their lips do fly, Let them be taken in their pride, because they curse and lye, 13In wrath consume th?, th? consume that so they may not be: And that in Jacob God doth rule to th'earths ends let them see. 14At evening let thou them return making great noise, and sound Like to a dog, and often walk about the city round. 15And let them wander up and down in seeking food, to eat; And let th? grudg when they shal not be satisfied with meat. 16But of thy pow'r I'le sing aloud at morn thy mercy praise: For thou to me my refuge wast, and towr in troublous dayes. 17O God, that art my strength, I will sing praises unto thee; For God is my defence, a God of mercy unto me. PSAL. LX.

O who is he that to the land of Edom will me guide? 10O God, which hadest us cast off, this thing wilt thou not do? Ev'n thou, O God, which didest not forth with our armies go. 11Help us from trouble: for the help is vain which man supplies. 12Through God wee'l do great acts: he shal tread down our enemies. PSAL.

PSAL. LXII. [1] My soul with expectation depends on God indeed; My strength and my salvation doth from him alone proceed. 2He onely my salvation is, and my strong rock is he; He onely is my sure defence; much mov'd I shal not be. 3How long will ye against a man plot mischief? ye shal all Be slain, ye as a tottering fence shall be, and bowing wall. 4They onely plot to cast him down from his excellency; They joy in lies, with mouth they bless but they curse inwardly. 5My soul wait thou with patience upon thy God alone: On him dependeth all my hope and expectation. 6He onely my salvation is, and my strong Rock is He; He onely is my sure defence: I shal not moved be. 7In God my glory placed is, and my salvation sure: In God the Rock is of my strength, my refuge most secure. 8Ye people place your confidence in him continually; Before him pour ye out your heart: God is our refuge hie. 9Surely mean men are vanitie, and great men are a lie: In ballance laid, they wholly are more light then vanitie. 10Trust ye not in oppression, in robbery be not vain: On wealth set not your hearts, when as increased is your gain. 11God hath it spoken once to me, yes, this I heard a gain, That power, to Almighty God alone, doth appertain. 12Yea mercy also unto thee belongs, O Lord, alone; For thou according to his work rewardest every one. PSAL. LXIII.

Of each of them the inward thought, and very heart is deep. 7God shal an arrow shoot at them, and wound them suddenly. 8So their own tongue shal them confound all who them see shal fly. 9And on all men a fear shal fal; Gods works they shal declare: For they shal wisely notice take what these his doings are. 10In God the righteous shal rejoyce, and trust upon his might; Yea they, shal greatly glory all, in heart that are upright.

PSAL. LXVI. [1] All lands to God in joyful sounds aloft your voices raise. 2Sing forth the honour of his Name, and glorious make his praise. 3Say unto God, How terrible in all thy works art thou? Through thy great pow'r thy foes to thee shal be constrain'd to bow. 4All on the earth shal worship thee, they shal thy praise proclaime, In songs: they shall sing cheerfully unto thy holy Name. 5Come, &amp; the works that God hath wroght with admiration see! In's workings to the sons of men most terrible is he. 6Into dry land the sea he turn'd, and they a passage had. Ev'n matching through the floud on foot, there we in him were glad. 7He ruleth ever by his power, his eyes the nations see: O let not the rebellious ones lift up themselves on hie. 8Ye people blesse our God; aloud the voice speak of his praise. 9Our soul in life who safe preserves, our foot from sliding stays. 10For thou didst prove, &amp; try us, Lord as men do silver try; 11Broughtst us into the net, &amp; mad'st bands on our loins to ly 12Thou hast caus'd men ride o're our heads and though that we did passe Through fire &amp; water, yet thou broghtst us to a wealthy place. 13I'le bring burnt-offerings to thy house to thee my vows I'le pay, 14Which my lips utter'd, my mouth spake when trouble on me lay. 15Burnt-sacrifices of fat rams with incense I wil bring; Of bullocks and of goats I wil present an offering. 16Al that fear God come hear, I'le tel what he did for my soul. 17I with my mouth unto him cryd, my tongue did him extol. 18If in my heart I sin regard, the Lord me wil not hear: 19But surely God me heard, and to my prayers voice gave ear. 20O let the Lord, our gracious God, for ever blessed be, Who turned not my pray'r from him, nor yet his grace from me.

Till every one submit himself, and silver pieces bring: The people that delight in war disperse, O God, and King. 31Those that be Princes great, shal then come out of Egypt lands, And Æthiopia to God shal soon stretch out her hands. 32O all ye Kingdoms of the earth, sing praises to this King; For he is Lord that ruleth all, unto him praises sing. 33To him that rides on heav'ns of heav'ns, w?? he of old did found; Lo, he sends out his voyce, a voice in might that doth abound. 34Strength unto God do ye ascribe; for his excellencie Is over Israel, his strength is in the clouds most hie. 35Thou'rt from thy Temple dreadful Lord; Isra'ls own God is he Who gives his people str?gth, &amp; pow'r O let God blessed be.

O Lord, the God of Israel, let none, who search do make And seek thee, be at any time confounded for my sake. 7For I have born reproach for thee, my face is hid with shame. 8To brethren strange, to mothers sons an alien I became. 9Because the zeal did eat me up which to thy House I bare; And the reproaches cast at thee, upon me fallen are. 10My tears and fasts t'afflict my soul were turned to my shame. 11When sackcloth I did wear, to them a proverb I became. 12The men, that in the gate do sit, against me evill spake; They also, that vile drunkards were, of me their song did make. 13But in an acceptable time my pray'r, Lord, is to thee: In truth of thy salvation, Lord, and mercy great, hear me. 14Deliver me out of the mire, from sinking do me keep; Free me from those that do me hate, and from the waters deep. 15Let not the floud on me prevail, whose water overflows; Nor deep me swallow, nor the pit her mouth upon me close. 16Hear me, O Lord, because thy love and kindnesse is most good; Turn unto me, according to thy mercies multitude. 17Nor from thy servant hide thy face, I'm troubled, soon attend. 18Draw neer my soul, and it redeem, me from my foes defend. 19To thee is my reproach wel known, my shame, and my disgrace: Those that mine adversaries be, are all before thy face. 20Reproach hath broke my heart, I'm ful of grief; I look'd for one To pity me, but none I found; comforters found I none. 21They also bitter gall did give unto me for my meat: They gave me vineger to drink, when as my thirst was great. 22Before them let their table prove a snare; and do thou make Their welfare and prosperitie a trap themselves to take. 23Let thou their eyes so darkned be, that sight may them forsake; And let their loins be made by thee continually to shake. 24Thy fury pour thou out on them, and indignation; And let thy wrathfull anger, Lord, fast hold take them upon. 25All waste and desolate let be. their habitation, And in their tabernacles all inhabitants be none. 26Because him they do persecute, whom thou didst smite before; They talk unto the grief of those whom thou hast wounded sore. 27Adde thou iniquity unto their former wickednesse: And do not let them come at all into thy righteousnesse. 28Out of the book of life let them be raz'd, and blotted quite; Among the just and righteous let not their names be writ. 29But now, become exceeding poor, and sorrowful am I: By thy salvation, O my God, let mee be set on hie. 30The Name of God, I, with a song most chearfully wil praise; And I, in giving thanks to him, his Name shal highly raise. 31This to the Lord a sacrifice more gracious shal prove, Then bullock, ox, or any beast that hath both horn and hoof. 32When this the humble menshal see it joy to them shal give: O all ye, that do seek the Lord, your heart shal ever live. 33For, God the poor hears, &amp; wil not his prisoners contemn. 34Let heav'n, &amp; earth, &amp; seas him praise, and all that move in them. 35For God wil Judah's cities build, and he wil Sion save; That they may dwel therein, and it in sure possession have. 36And they that are his servants seed inherit shal the same; So shal they have there dwelling there that love his blessed Name.

PSAL. LXXIII. [1] Yet God is good to Israel, to each pure hearted one. 2But as for me, my steps neer slipt, my feet were almost gone. 3For I invious was, and grudg'd the foolish folk to see, When I perceiv'd the wicked sort enjoy prosperitie. 4For stil their strength continueth firm their death of bands is free: 5They are not toil'd as other men, nor plagu'd as others bee: 6Therefore, their pride, like to a chain them compasseth about; And, as a garment, violence doth cover them throughout. 7Their eyes stand out with fat, they have more then their hearts could wish. 8They are corrupt, their talk of wrong both lewd and loftie is. 9They set their mouth against the heav'ns in their blasphemous talk; And their reproaching tongue throughout the earth at large doth walk. 10His people often times for this look back, and turn about, Sith waters of so full a cup to these are powred out. 11And thus they say, How can it be that God these things doth know? Or, can there in the Highest be knowledge of things below? 12Behold, these are the wicked ones, yet prosper at their will In worldly things, they do increase in wealth and riches still. 13I verily have done in vain my heart to purifie: To no effect in innocence washed my hands have I. 14For dayly, and all day throughout great plagues I suffered have; Yea every morning I of new did chastisement receive. 15If in this manner foolishly to speak I would intend, Thy childrens generation behold I should offend. 16When I this thought to know, it was too hard a thing for me, 17Till to Gods Sanctuary I went, then I their end did see. 18Assuredly thou didst them set a slippery place upon: Them suddenly thou castedst down into destruction. 19How in a moment, suddenly to ruine brought are they! With fearful terrours utterly they are consum'd away. 20Ev'n like unto a dream, when one from sleeping doth arise; So thou, O Lord, when thou awak'st, their image shalt despise. 21Thus grieved was my heart in me, and me my reins opprest. 22So rude was I, and ignorant, and in thy sight a beast. 23Neverthelesse continually, O Lord, I am with thee: Thou dost me hold by my right hand, and still upholdest me. 24Thou, with thy counsel, while I live wilt me conduct and guide; And to thy glory afterward receive me, to abide. 25Whom have I in the heavens high, but thee, O Lord, alone? And in the earth, whom I desire beside thee, there is none. 26My flesh &amp; heart doth faint &amp; fail, but God doth fail me never; For of my heart God is the strength, and portion for ever. 27For lo, those that are far from thee, they quickly perish shall: Them, that a-whoring from thee go, thou hast destroyed all. 28But surely it is good for me, that I draw near to God: In God I trust, that all thy works I may declare abroad. PSAL. LXXIV. [1] O God, why hast thou cast us off? is it for evermore? Against thy pasture sheep why doth thine anger smoke so sore? 2O call to thy rememberance thy congregation, Which thou hast purchased of old; still think the same upon. The rod of thine inheritance, which thou redeemed hast, This Sion hill, wherein thou hadst thy dwelling in times past. 3To these long desolations thy feet lift, do not tarry; For all the ills thy foes have done within thy Sanctuary. 4Amidst thy congregations thine enemies do roar: Their ensigns they set up, for signs of triumph, thee before. 5A man was famous, and was had in estimation, According as he lifted up his axe thick trees upon. 6But all at once with axes now and hammers they go to, And down the carved work thereof they break, and quite undo. 7They fired have thy Sanctuary, and have defil'd the same, By casting down unto the ground the place where dwelt thy Name. 8Thus said they in their hearts, Let us destroy them out of hand: They burnt up all the Synagogues of God, within the land 9Our signes we do not now behold; there is not us among A prophet more, nor any one that knows the time how long. 10How long, Lord, shall the enemy thus in reproach exclaime? And shal the adversary thus alwayes blaspheme thy Name? 11Thy hand, ev'n thy right hand of might, why dost thou thus draw back? O from thy bosome pluck it out, for our deliverance sake. 12For certainly God is my King, ev'n from the times of old, Working in midst of all the earth salvation manifold. 13The sea, by thy great pow'r to part a sunder, thou didst make; And thou the dragons heads, O Lord, within the waters brake. 14The Leviathans heads, thou brake in pieces, and didst give Him to be meat unto the folk in wildernesse that live. 15Thou clave the fountain &amp; the floud which did with streams abound: Thou dry'dst the mighty waters up unto the very ground. 16Thine onely is the day, O Lord, thine also is the night; And thou alone prepared hast the sun &amp; shining light. 17By thee the borders of the earth were setled every where: The summer and the winter both by thee created were. 18That th'enemy reproached hath, O keep it in record; And that the foolish people have blasphem'd thy Name, O Lord. 19Unto the multitude do not thy turtles soul deliver; The congregation of thy poor do not forget for ever. 20Unto thy covenant have respect: for earths dark places be Full of the habitations of horrid crueltie. 21O let not those that be opprest return again with shame: Let those that poor and needy are give praise unto thy Name. 22Do thou, O God, arise and plead the cause that is thine own: Remember how thou art reproacht still by the foolish one 23Do not forget the voyce of those that are thine enemies: Of those the tumult ever grows that do against thee rise. PSAL. LXXV. [1] To thee, O God, do we give thanks we do give thanks to thee: Because thy wondrous works declare thy great Name near to be. 2I purpose, when I shall receive the congregation, That I shal judgement uprightly render to ever one. 3Dissolved is the land, with all that in the same do dwel; But I the pillars thereof do bear up, and stablish wel. 4I, to the foolish people said, Do not deal foolishly; And unto those that wicked are, Life not your horn on hie. 5Lift not your horn on high, nor speak 6with stubborn neck: but know, That nor from east, nor west, nor south promotion doth flow. 7But God is Judge: He puts down one, and sets another up: 8For in the hand of God most high of red wine is a cup; It's ful of mixture; he pours forth, and makes the wicked all Wring out the bitter dregs thereof, yea, and they drink them shal. 9But I, for ever wil declare, I Jacobs God wil praise. 10All horns of lewd men I'le cut off; but just mens horns wil raise. PSAL. LXXVI. [1] In Judah's land God is wel known, his Nam's in Israel great: 2In Salem is his Tabernacle, in Sion is his Seat. 3There arrows of the bow he brake, the shield, the sword, the war. 4More glorious thou then hi?l?s of prey more excellent art far. 5Those that were stout of heart are spoil'd, they slept their sleep outright; And none of those their hands did finde that were the men of might. 6When thy rebuke, O Jacobs God, had forth against them past, Their horses and their chariots both were in a dead sleep cast. 7Thou, Lord, ev'nth? art he that should be fear'd, and who is he That may stand up before thy sight, if once thou angry be? 8From heav'n thou judgement caus'd be heard; the earth was still with fear, 9When God to judgement rose, to save all meek on earth that were. 10Surely the very wrath of man unto thy praise redounds: Thou to the remnant of his wrath wilt set restraining bounds. 11Vow to the Lord, your God, &amp; pay; all ye that near him be Bring gifts and presents unto him, for to be fear'd is he. 12By him the spirits shal be cut off of those that princes are: Unto the Kings that are on earth he fearful doth appear. PSAL. LXXVII. [1] Vnto the Lord I with my voice, I unto God did cry Ev'n with my voice, and unto me his ear he did apply. 2I in my trouble sought the Lord: my sore by night did run, And ceased not: my grieved soul did consolation shun. 3I to remembrance God did cal, yet trouble did remain; And overwhelm my spirit was whiles I did sore complain. 4Mine eyes debar'd from rest &amp; sleep thou makest stil to wake: My trouble is so great, that I unable am to speak. 5The dayes of old to minde I call'd, and oft did think upon The times and ages, that are past ful many years agone. 6By night my song I cal to minde, and commune with my heart, My sp'rit did carefully inquire how I might ease my smart. 7For ever wil the Lord cast off? and gracious be no more? 8For ever is his mercy gone? fails his word evermore? 9Is't true that to be gracious the Lord forgotten hath? And that his tender mercies he hath shut up in his wrath? 10Then did I say, that surely this is mine infirmitie: I'le minde the years of the righthand of him that is most hie. 11Yea, I remember wil the works performed by the Lord; The wonders done of old by thee I surely wil record. 12I also wil of all thy works my meditation make, And of thy doings to discourse great pleasure I wil take. 13O God, thy way most holy is within thy Sanctuary: And what God is so great in pow'r, as is our God most hie? 14Thou art the God that wonders do'st by thy right hand most strong; Thy mighty pow'r thou hast declar'd the nations among. 15To thine own people w?? thine arm thou didst redemption bring; To Jacobs sons, and to the Tribes of Joseph that do spring. 16The waters, Lord, perceived thee, the waters saw thee wel; And they for fear aside did flie; the depths on trembling fel. 17The clouds in water forth were pour'd, sound loudy did the sky; And swiftly through the world abroad thine arrows fierce did fly. 18Thy thunders voice alongst the heav'n a mighty noise did make: By lightnings lightned was the world th'earth tremble did and shake. 19Thy Way is in the sea, and in the waters great thy path; Yet are thy footsteps hid, O Lord, none knowledge thereof hath. 20Thy people thou didst safely lead like to a flock of sheep, By Moses hand and Aarons Thou didst them conduct and keep. PSAL. LXXVIII. [1] Attend, my people, to my Law, thereto give thou an ear: The words that fr? my mouth proceed attentively do hear 2My mouth shal speak a parable, and sayings dark of old: 3The same which we have heard, &amp; known and us our fathers told. 4We also wil them not conceal from their posteritie: Them to the generation to come declare wil we: The praises of the Lord our God, and his Almighty strength, The wondr?s works that he hath done we wil shew forth at length. 5His testimony and his law in Israel he did place, And charg'd our fathers, it to show to their succeeding race. 6That so the race which was to come, might wel them learn and know; And sons unborn, who should arise, might to their sons them show: 7That they might set their hope in God, and suffer not to fal His mighty works out of their minde but keep His precepts all. 8And might not, like their fathers, be a stiff rebellious race, A race not right in heart; with God whose spirit not stedfast was. 9The sons of Ephraim, who nor bows nor other arms did lack, When as the day, of battell was they faintly turned back. 10They brake Gods covenant &amp; refus'd in His Commands to go. 11His works &amp; wonders they forgot, which he to them did show. 12Things marvellous he brought to passe, their fathers them beheld, Within the land of Ægypt done, yea ev'n in Zoans field. 13By him divided was the sea, He caus'd them through to passe; And He the water mode to stand, that like an heap it was. 14With cloud by day, w?? light of fire all night he did them guide. 15In desert rocks he clave, and drink as from great depths suppli'd. He from the rock brought streams, like flouds made waters to run down. 17Yet sinning more, in desert they provok'd the Highest One. 18For, in their heart they tempted God and speaking with mistrust, They greedily did meat require to satisfie their lust. 19Against the Lord himself they spake and murmuring said thus, A table in the wildernesse can God prepare for us? 20Behold, He smote the rock, &amp; thence came streams and waters great; But can he give his people bread? and send them flesh to eat? 21The Lord did hear, &amp; waxed wroth so kindled was a flame 'Gainst Jacob; and 'gainst Israel up in indignation came: 22For they believ'd not God, nor trust in his salvation had: 23Though flouds above he did command, and heav'ns doors open made; And Manna rain'd on them, and gave them corn of heav'n to eat. 25Man Angels food did eat, to them He to the full sent meat. 26And in the heaven He did cause an Eastern winde to blow; And by his power he let out the Southern winde to go. 27Then flesh, as thick as dust, he made to rain down them among; And feathered fowls, like as the sand which ly'th the shore along. 28At his command amidst their camp these showres of flesh down fell, All round about the tabernacles and tents where they did dwell. 29So did they eat abundantly, and had of meat their fill; For he did give to them what was their own desire and will. 30They fr? their lust had not estrang'd their heart and their desire; But while y? meat was in their mouth which they did so require, 31Gods wrath upon them came, and slew the fattest of them all; So that the choise of Israel, o'rethown by death, did fall. 32Yet not withstanding of all this, they sinned still the more; And, thogh he had great wonders wrought believed him not therefore. 33Wherefore their dayes in vanity he did consume and wast, And by his wrath their wretched years away in trouble past. 34But when he slew them, then they did to seek him shew desire: Yea, they return'd, and after God right early did inquire. 35And that the Lord had been their Rock they did remember then: Ev'n that the high Almighty God had their Redeemer been. 36Yet with their mouth they flatter'd him, and spake but fainedly, And they unto the God of truth with their false tongues did ly. 37For, tho their words were good, their heart with him was not sincere: Unstedfast and perfidious they in his covenant were. 38But full of pity, he forgave their sin, them did not slay; Nor stirr'd up all his wrath, but oft his anger turn'd away. 39For that they were but fading flesh to minde he did recall; A winde that passeth soon away, and not returns at all. 40How often did they him provoke within the wildernesse? And in the desert did him grieve with their rebelliousnesse? 41Yea, turning back they tempted God and limits set upon Him who in midst of Israel is thy onely holy One. 42They did not cal to minde his pow'r nor yet the day when he Delivered them out of the hand of their fierce enemie. 43Nor how great signs in Ægyptland He openly had wrought, What miracles in Zoans field his hand to passe had brought. 44How lakes and rivers every where he turned into bloud; So that nor man, nor beast could drink of standing lake or floud. 45He brought among them swarms of flies which did them sore annoy; And diverse kindes of filthy frogs He sent, them to destroy. 46He to the catterpiller gave the fruits of all their soil: Their labours he deliver'd up unto the locusts spoil. 47Their vines w?? hail, their sycomors he with the frost did blast. 48Their beasts to hail he gave, their flocks hot thunder-bolts did wast. 49Fierce burning wrath he on them cast and indignation strong; And troubles lore, by sending forth ill angels them among. 50He to his wrath made way: their soul from death he did not save; But over to the pestilence the lifes of them he gave. 51In Ægypt Land the first-born all he smote down every where; Amongst the tents of Ham, ev'n these chief of their strength that were. 52But his own people like to sheep thence to go forth he made; And he amidst the wildernesse them, as a flock, did lead. 53And he them safely on did lead, so that they did not fear: Whereas their enemies by the sea quite overwhelmed were. 54To borders of his Sanctuary the Lord his people led, Ev'n to the mount, w?? his right hand for them had purchased. 55The nations of Canaan by his Almighty hand Before their face he did expel out of their native land, Which for inheritance to them by line he did divide, And made the tribes of Israel within their tents abide. 56Yet God most high they did provoke and tempted ever stil, And to observe his testimonies did not incline their wil. 57But like their fathers turned back and dealt unfaithfully: Aside they turned, like a bow that shoots deceitfully. 58For, they to anger did provoke him with their places hie; And with their graven images mov'd him to jealousie. 59Wh? God heard this, he waxed wroth and much loath'd Israel then: 60So Shilohs tent, he left, the tent which he had plac'd with men: 61And he his strength delivered into captivity, He left his glory in the hand of his proud enemy. 62His people also He gave over unto the swords fierce rage: So sore his wrath inflamed was against his heritage. 63The sire consum'd their choice young men: their maids no marriage had. 64And when their priests fel by the sword their wives no morning made. 65But then the Lord arose, as one that doth from sleep awake; And like a gyant, that by wine refresht, a shout doth make. 66Upon his enemies hinder parts he made his stroke to fal; And so upon them he did put a shame perpetual. 67Moreover, he the tabernacle of Joseph did refuse; The mighty tribe of Ephraim he would in no wise chuse. 68But he did chuse Jehudahs tribe to be the rest above, And of mount Sion he made choise, which he so much did love. 69And he his Sanctuary built, like to a palace hie, Like to the earth, which he did found to perpetuitie. 70Of David, that his servant was, he also choise did make; And even from the folds of sheep was pleased him to take. 71From waiting on the ewsw?? young, he brought him for to fed Israel, his inheritance, His people Jacobs seed. 72So after the integrity of his heart he them fed; And by the good skil of his hands them wisely governed. PSAL. LXXIX. [1] O God, the heathen entred have Thine heritage, by them Defiled is thy house; on heaps they laid Jerusalem. 2The bodies of thy servants they have cast forth to be meat To rav'nous fowls, thy dear saints flesh they give to beasts, to eat. 3Their bloud about Jerusalem like water have they shed; And there was none to bury them when they were slain and dead. 4Unto our neighbours a reproach most base become are we, Ascorn and laughing-stock to them that round about us be. 5How long, Lord, shal thine anger last wilt thou stil keep the same? And shal thy fervent jealousie burn like unto a flame. 6On heathens poure thy fury forth, that have thee never known, And on these kingdoms w?? thy Name have never call'd upon. 7For these are they which Jacob have devouted cruelly, And they his habitation have caused waste to ly. 8Against us minde not former sins: thy tender mercies show, Let them prevent us speedily, for we're brought very low. 9For thy Names glory help us, Lord, who hast our Saviour bin: Deliver us; for thy Names sake O purge away our sin. 10Why say the heathen, Where's their God let him to them be known, Wh? these, who shed thy serv?ts bloud are in our sight o'rethrown. 11O let the prisoners sights ascend before thy sight on hie: Preserve those in thy mighty pow'r, that are design'd to dy. 12And to our neighbours bosom cause it seven-fold rendred be, Ev'n the reproach, where w?? they have O Lord, reproached thee. 13So we thy folk and pasture-sheep shal give thee thanks alwayes, And unto generations all we wil shew forth thy praise.

Egypt brought thou hast, by thine outstretched hand: And thou the heathen out didst cast, to plant it in their land. 9Before it thou a room didst make, where it might grow and stand; Thou causedst it deep root to take, and it did fil the land. 10The mountains vail'd we?ew?? its shade as with a covering: Like goodly Ceders were the boughs, which out from it did spring. 11Upon the one hand, to the sea her boughs she did out send; On th'other side, unto the floud her branches did extend. 12Why hast thou then thus broken down and tane her hedge away? So that all passengers do pluck, and make of her a prey. 13The boar who fr? the forrest comes doth waste it at his pleasure: The wilde beast of the field also devours it out of measure. 14O God of hosts, we thee beseech return now unto thine; Look down fr? heav'n in love, behold and visit this thy vine: 15This vineyard w?? thine own right hand hath planted us among: And that same branch, w?? for thy self thou hast made to be strong. 16Burnt up it is with flaming fire, it also is cut down: They utterly are perished when as thy face doth frown. 17O let thy hand be stil upon the man of thy right hand; The son of man, whom for thy self thou madest strong to stand. 18So henceforth we wil not go back, nor turn from thee at all: O do thou quicken us, and we upon thy Name wil cal. 19Turn us again, Lord God of hosts, and upon us vouchsafe To make thy countenance to shine, and so we shal be safe.

They know not, nor wil understand in darknesse they walk on: All the foundations of the earth out of their course are gone. 6I said that you are gods, and are sons of the highest all; 7But ye shal die like men, and as one of the princes fal. 8O God, do thou raise up thy self the earth to judgement cal: For thou, as thine inheritance, shalt take the nations all. PSAL. LXXXIII.

PSAL. LXXXIV. [1] How lovely is thy dwelling place, O Lord of hosts, to me! The tabernacles of thy grace how pleasant, Lord, they be! 2My thirstie soul longs vehemently, yea, faints thy Courts to see: My very heart and flesh cry out, O living God, for thee. 3Behold, the sparrow findeth out an house wherein to rest: The swallow also for her self hath purchased a nest: Ev'n thine own altars, where she safe her young ones forth may bring, O thou Almighty, Lord of hosts, who art my God, and King. 4Blest are they in thy house that dwel they ever give thee praise. 5Blest is the man whose strength thou art in whose heart are thy wayes. 6Who passing through Baca's dry vale therein do dig up wels; Also the rain that falleth down the pools with water fils. 7So they from strength unwearied go stil forward unto strength, Until in Zion they appear before the Lord at length. 8Lord God of hosts, my prayer hear O Jacobs God, give ear. 9See God, our shield, look on the face of thine anointed dear. 10For in thy Courts one day excels a thousand; rather in My Gods house wil I keep a door, then dwel in tents of sin. 11For, God the Lord's a sun &amp; shield: Hee'l grace and glory give; And wil withhold no good from them that uprightly do live. 12O thou that art the Lord of hosts, that man is truly blest, Who by assured confidence on thee alone doth rest. PSAL. LXXXV.

Wilt thou to generations al thine anger forth extend? 6That in thee may thy people joy, wilt thou not us revive? 7Shew us thy mercy, Lord, to us do thy salvation give. 8I'le hear what God, the Lord, wil speak to his folk He'l speak peace. And to his saints; but let them not return to foolishnesse. 9To them that fear Him, surely near is his salvation; That glory in our land may have her habitation. 10Truth met with mercy, righteousnesse and peace kiss'd mutually. 11Truth springs from earth, &amp; righteousnes looks down from heaven hie. 12Yea, what is good the Lord shal give: our land shal yeeld increase. 13Justice, to set us in his steps, shal go before his face.

Who is like God among the sons of these that mighty are? 7Great fear in meetings of the saints is due unto the Lord; And he, of all about him, should with reverence be ador'd. 8O thou that art the Lord of hosts, what Lord in mightinesse Is like to thee? who compast round art with thy faithfulnesse. 9Ev'n in the raging of the sea thou over it dost raign; And when the waves thereof do swel, thou stillest them again 10Rahab in pieces thou didst break, like one that slaughtered is; And with thy mighty arm thou hast disperst thine enemies. 11The heav'ns are thine, thou for thine own the earth dost also take: The world, and fulnesse of the same, thy power did found and make. 12The north &amp; south from thee alone their first beginning had: Both Tabor mount, and Hermon hil shal in thy Name be glad. 13Th? hast an arm that's ful of pow'r thy hand is great in might; And thy right hand exceedingly exalted is in height. 14Justice &amp; judgement of thy Throne are made the dwelling place: Mercy, accompani'd with truth, shal go before thy face. 15O greatly blest the people are, the joyful sound that know: In brightnesse of thy face O Lord, they ever on shall go. 16They in thy name shal all the day rejoyce exceedingly, And in thy righteousnesse shal they exalted be on hy. 17Because the glory of their strength doth only stand in thee. And in thy favour shal our horn and pow'r exalted be, 18For God is our defence, and he to us doth safety bring: The holy One of Israel is our Almighty King 19In vision to thy holy-one thou saidst, I help upon A strong one laid; out of the folk I rais'd a chosen one. 20Ev'n David, I have found him out a servant unto Me; And with my holy oyl My King anointed him to be. 21With whom My hand shal establisht be Mine arm shal make him strong. 22On him the foe shal not exact, nor son of mischief wrong, 23I wil beat down before his face all his malicious foes: I wil them greatly plague, who do with hatred him oppose 24My mercy, and my faithfulnesse with him yet still shal be; And in my name his horn and pow'r, men shal exalted see. 25His hand and pow'r shal reach afar, I'le set it in the sea; And his right hand established shal in the rivers be. 26Thou art my father, he shal cry, thou art my God alone; And he shal say, Thou art the rock of my salvation. 27I'le make him my first-born, more high then Kings of any land: 28My love I'le ever keep for him, My cov'nant fast shal stand. 29His seed I by my power wil make for ever to endure; And, as the dayes of heaven, his throne shal stable be and sure. 30But if his children shal forsake My Lawes, and go astray, And in my judgements shal not walk but wander from my way. 31If they my Lawes break, &amp; do not keep my Commandements, 32I'le visit then their faults with rods their sins with chastisements, 33Yet I'le not take my love from him nor false my promise make; 34My cov'nant I'le not break nor chang what with my mouth I spake. 35Once by my holinesse I sware, to David I'le not ly. 36His seed and throne shal as the sun before me last for ay. 37It like the moon shal ever be establisht stedfastly; And like to that which in the heav'n doth witnesse faithfully. 38But thou displeased, hast cast off, thou didst abhore and loath; With him that thine anointed is thou hast been very wroth. 39Thou hast thy servants covenant made void and quite cast by; Thou hast profan'd his crown, while it cast on the ground doth ly. 40Th? al his hedges hast broke down his strong holds down hast torn. 41He to all passers by a spoil, to neighbours is a scorn. 42Thou hast set up his foes right hand mad'st all his enemies glad; 43Turn'd his swords edge, &amp; him to stand in battel hast not made. 44His glory thou hast made to cease, his throne to ground down cast; 45Shortned his dayes of youth, &amp; him with shame thou covered hast. 46How long, Lord? wilt thou hide thy self for ever in thine ire? And shal thine indignation burn like unto a fire? 47Remember, Lord, how short a time I shal on earth remain; O wherefore is it so, that thou hast made all men in vain? 48What man is he that liveth here, and death shal never see? Or from the power of the grave what man his soul shal free? 49Thy former loving kindnesses, O Lord, where be they now? Those which in truth &amp; faithfulnesse to David sworn hast thou. 50Minde, Lord, thy servants sad reproach how I in bosome bear The scornings of the people all who strong and mighty are. 51Wherewith thy raging enemies reproach'd, O Lord, think on, wherewith they have reproach'd the steps of thine anointed One. 52All blessing to the Lord, our God, let be ascribed then: For evermore so let it be. Amen, yea and amen. PSAL. XC. [1] Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in generations all. 2Before thou ever hadst brought forth the mountains great or small. Ere ever thou hadst form'd the earth, and all the world abroad, Ev'n thou, from everlasting art to everlasting, God. 3Thou dost unto destruction man that is mortal turn; And unto them thou say'st, again ye sons of men return. 4Because a thousand years appear no more before thy sight Then yesterday, when it is past, or then a watch by night. 5As with an overflowing floud thou carriest them away: They like a sleep are, like the grasse that grows at morn are they. 6At morn it flourishes and growes, cut down at ev'n doth fade: 7For by thine anger we consume, thy wrath makes us afraid. 8Our sins thou and iniquities dost in thy presence place, And setst our secret faults before the brightnesse of thy face. 9For in thine anger all our dayes do passe on, to an end; And, as a tale that hath been told, so we our years do spend. 10Threescore and ten years do sum up our dayes and years we see: Or if by reason of more strength, in some fourscore they be; Yet doth the strength of such old men but grief and labour prove; For it is soon cut oft, and we fly hence, and soon remove. 11Who knowes the power of thy wrath according to thy fear 12So is thy wrath. Lord teach thou us our end in mind to bear: And so to count our dayes, that we our hearts may stil apply To learn thy wisdom and thy truth, that we may live thereby. 13Turn yet again to us, O Lord; how long thus shal it be? Let it repent thee now, for those that servants are to thee. 14O with thy tender mercies, Lord, us early satisfie; So we rejoyce shal all our dayes, and still be glad in thee. 15According as the dayes have been wherein we grief have had, And years wherein we ill have seen, so do thou make us glad. 16O let thy work and pow'r appear thy servants face before; And show unto their children dear thy glory evermore. 17And let the beauty of the Lord our God be us upon: Our handie-works establish thou, establish them each one. PSAL. XCI. [1] He that doth in the secret place of the most high reside, Under the shade of him, that is th'Almighty, shal abide. 2I of the Lord, my God wil say, he is my refuge stil, He is my fortresse, and my God, and in him trust I wil. 3Assuredly he shal thee save, and give deliverance From subtil fowlers snare, and from the noysome pestilence. 4His feathers shal thee hide; thy trust under his wings shal be: His faithfulnesse shal be a shield and buckler unto thee. 5Thou shalt not need to be afraid for terrours of the night, Nor for the arrow that doth fly by day, while it is light: 6Nor for the pestilence, that walks in darknesse secretly, Nor for destruction, that doth waste at noon-day, openly. 7A thousand at thy side shal fal, on thy right hand shal ly Ten thousand dead, yet unto thee it shal not once come nigh. 8Only thou with thine eyes shalt look and a beholder be; And thou therein the just reward of wicked men shalt see. 9Because the Lord, who constantly my refuge is alone, Ev'n the most high is made by thee thy habitation. 10No plague shal near thy dwelling come no ill shal thee befal: 11For thee to keep in all thy wayes his Angels charge he shal. 12They in their hands shal bear thee up, stil waiting thee upon; Lest thou at any time should dash thy foot against a stone. 13Upon the adder thou shalt tread, and on the Lyon strong; Thy feet on Dragons trample shal, and on the Lions young. 14Because on me he set his love, I'le save and set him free: Because My great Name he hath known I'wil him set on high. 15He'l cal on Me, I'le answer him, I'wil be with him stil In trouble to deliver him, and honour him I wil. 16With length of days unto his minde I wil him satisfie; I also My salvation wil cause his eyes to see. PSAL. XCII. [1] To render thanks unto the Lord it is a comly thing, And to thy Name O thou most high, due praise aloud to sing. 2Thy loving kindnesse to show forth. when shines the morning light: And to declare thy fathfulnesse, with pleasure, every night. 3On a ten stringed instrument, upon the psalterie: And on the harp, with solemn sound, and grave-sweet melodie. 4For thou, Lord, by thy mighty work, hast made my heart right glad; And I will triumph in the works which by thine hands were made. 5How great, Lord, are thy works! each thought of thine a deep it is; 6A brutish man it knoweth not, fools understand not this. 7When those that lewd &amp; wicked are, spring quickly up like grasse, And workers of iniquity do flourish all apace, It is that they for ever may destroyed be and slain: 8But thou, O Lord, art the most high for ever to remain. 9For lo, thine enemies, O Lord, thine enemies perish shal: The workers of iniquity shal be dispersed all. 10But thou shalt, like unto the horn of th'unicorn, exalt My horn on high; thou with fresh oyl anoint me also shalt. 11Mine eye shal also my desire see on mine enemies; Mine ears shal of the wicked hear, that do against me rise. 12But like the palm-tree, flourishing shal be the righteous one: He shal like to the Cedar grow that is in Lebanon. 13Those that within the house of God are planted by his grace, They shal grow up, and flourish all in our Gods holy place. 14And in old age, when others fade, they fruit stil forth shal bring: They shal be sat, and ful of sap, and ay be flourishing. 15To shew that upright is the Lord, he is a rock to me: And he from all unrighteousnesse is altogether free. PSAL. XCIII. [1] The Lord doth reign, &amp; cloath'd is he with majesty most bright: His works do show him cloath'd to be and girt about with might. The world is also stablished, that it can not depart. 2Thy throne is fixt of old, and thou from everlasting art. 3The flouds, O Lord, have lifted up, they lifted up their voice; The flouds have lifted up their waves and made a mighty noise. 4But yet the Lord, that is on high, is more of might by far. Then noise of many waters is, or great sea billows are. 5Thy testimonies, every one, in faithfulnesse excel: And holinesse for ever, Lord, thine house becometh wel. PSAL. XCIV. [1] O Lord God, unto whom alone all vengeance doth belong, O mighty God, who vengeance own'st shine forth, avenging wrong. 2Lift up thy self, thou of the earth the Soveraign Judge that art, And unto those that are so proud a due reward impart. 3How long, O mighty God, shal they who lewd and wicked be. How long shal they who wicked are, thus triumph haughtilie? 4How long shal things most hard by, them be uttered and told, And all that work iniquity to boast themselves be bold? 5Thy folk they break in pieces, Lord thine heritage oppresse: 6The widow they, and stranger slay, and kil the fatherlesse. 7Yet say they, God it shal not see, nor God of Jacob know. 8Ye brutish people unsterstand, fools, when wise will ye grow? 9The Lord did plant the ear of man, and hear then shal not he? He only form'd the eye, and then shal he not clearly see, 10He that the nations doth correct, shal he not chastise you? He knowledge unto man doth teach, and shal himself not know? 11Mans thoughts to be but vanity, the Lord doth wel descern. 12Blest is the man th? chastnest, Lord and mak'st thy Law to learn. 13That thou may'st give him rest fr? dayes of sad adversitie, Until the pit be dig'd for those that work iniquitie. 14For sure the Lord wil not cast off those that his people be, Neither his own inheritance quit and forsake wil he. 15But judgement unto righteousnesse shal yet return again, And all shal follow after it that are right hearted men. 16Who wil rise up for me, against those that do wickedly? Who wil stand up for me, 'gainst those that work iniquity? 17Unlesse the Lord had been my help when I was sore opprest, Almost my soul had in the house of silence been at rest. 18When I had uttered this word, My foot doth slip away, Thy mercy held me up, O Lord, thy goodnesse did me stay. 19Amidst the multitude of thoughts, which in my heart do fight, My soul, lest it be overcharg'd, thy comforts do delight. 20Shal of iniquity the throne have fellowship with thee, Which mischief cunningly contriv'd, doth by a law decree? 21Against y? righteous souls they joyn they guiltlesse bloud condemn: 22But of my refuge God's the rock, and my defence from them. 23On them their own iniquity the Lord shal bring and lay, And out them off in their own sin, our Lord God shal them slay. PSAL. XCV. [1] O come let us sing to the Lord, come, let us, every one, A joyful noise make to the Rock of our salvation. 2Let us before his presence come, with praise and thankful voice: Let us sing Psalms to him with grace, and make a joyful noise. 3For God a great God, &amp; great King, above all gods, he is. 4Depths of the earth are in his hand, the strength of hils is his. 5To him the spacious sea belongs, for he the same did make: The dry land also from his hands its form at first did take. 6O come, and let us worship him, let us bow down withall, And on our knees before the Lord, our maker, let us fal. 7For He's our God, the people we of his own pasture are, And of his hand the sheep; to day if ye his voice wil hear, 8Then harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, As in the desert, on the day of the tentation. 9When me your fathers tempt'd, and prov'd, and did my working see: 10Ev'n for the space of fourty years this race hath grieved me: I said, this people erres in heart, my wayes they do not know: 11To whom I sware in wrath, that to my rest they should not go. PSAL. XCVI. [1] O sing a new song to the Lord, sing, all the earth, to God: 2To God sing, bless his Name, shew stil his saving health abroad. 3Among the heathen nations His glory do declare: And unto all the people show his works that wondrous are. 4For great's the Lord, and greatly he is to be magnifi'd; Yea, worthy to be fear'd is he above all gods beside: 5For all the gods are idols dumb which blinded nations fear: But our God is the Lord, by whom the heav'ns created were. 6Great honour is before his face, and majesty divine: Strength is within his holy place, and there doth beauty shine. 7Do you, ascribe unto the Lord, of people every tribe, Glory do you unto the Lord, and mighty pow'r ascribe. 8Give ye the glory to the Lord that to his Name is due: Come ye into his Courts, and bring an offering with you. 9In beauty of his holinesse O do the Lord adore: Likewise let all the earth throughout tremble his face before. 10Among the heathen say, God reigns the world shal stedfastly Be fixt from moving, He shal judge the people righteously. 11Let heav'ns be glad before the Lord and let the earth rejoyce, Let seas, and all that is therein, cry out, and make a noise: 12Let fields rejoyce, and every thing that springeth of the earth: Then woods, and every tree shal sing with gladnesse and with mirth 13Before the Lord; because he comes, to judge the earth comes he: He'l judge the world w?? righteousnes the people faithfullie. PSAL. XCVII. [1] God reigneth, let the earth be glad and isles rejoyce each one. 2Dark clouds him compass, and in right with judgement dwels his throne. 3Fire goes before him, and his foes it burns up round about. 4His lightnings lightned did the world earth saw, and shook throughout. 5Hils, at the presence of the Lord, like wax, did melt away: Ev'n at the presence of the Lord of al the earth, I say. 6The heav'ns declare his righteousnes all men his glory see. 7All who serve graven images confounded let them be: Who do of idols boast themselves let shame upon them fal. Ye that are called gods, see that ye do him worship all. 8Sion did hear, and joyful was, glad Judahs daughters were, They much rejoyc'd, O Lord, because thy judgements did appear. 9For thou, O Lord, art high above al things on earth that are: Above all other gods thou art exalted very far. 10Hate ill, all ye that love the Lord: his saints souls keepeth he, And from the hands of wicked men he sets them safe and free. 11For all those that be righteous sown is a joyful light, And gladnesse sown is for all those that are in heart upright. 12Ye righteous in the Lord rejoyce, expresse your thankfulnesse, When ye into your memory do cal his holinesse.

PSAL. CII. [1] O Lord, unto my pray'r give ear, my cry let come to thee: 2And in the day of my distresse hide not thy face from me: Give ear to me: what time I cal, to answer me make haste. 3For as an hearth my bones are burnt my dayes, like smoke, do waste. 4My heart within me smitten is, and it is withered, Like very grasse, so that I do forget to eat my bread. 5By reason of my groaning voice, my bones cleave to my skin, 6Like pelican in wildernesse forsaken I have bin: I like an owl in desert am, that nightly there doth moan: 7I watch, and like a sparrow am on the house top alone. 8My bitter enemies all the day reproaches cast on me: And being mad at me, with rage against me sworn they be. 9For why, I ashes eaten have, like bread, in sorrows deep; My drink I also mingled bave with tears that I did weep. 10Thy wrath and indignation did cause this grief and pain: For thou hast lift me up on high, and cast me down again. 11My dayes are like unto a shade, which doth declining passe: And I am dry'd and withered, ev'n like unto the grasse. 12But thou, Lord, everlasting art, and thy remembrance shal Continually endure, and be to generations all. 13Thou shalt arise, and mercy have upon thy Zion yet: The time to favour her is come, the time that thou hast set. 14For in her rubbish, and her stones thy servant pleasure take, Yea, they the very dust thereof do favour, for her sake. 15So shal the heathen people fear the Lords most holy Name: And all the Kings on earth shal dread thy glory, and thy fame 16When Zion by the mighty Lord built up again shal be, In glory then, and Majesty to men appear shal He. 17The prayer of the destitute he surely wil regard, Their prayer wil he not despise, by him it shal be heard. 18For generations yet to come this shal be on record: So shal the people that shal be created, praise the Lord. 19He from his Sanctuaries height hath downward cast his eye, And from his glorious throne in heaven, the Lord the earth did spy: 20That of the mournful prisoner the groanings he might hear, To set them free that unto death by men appointed are: 21That they in Zion may declare the Lords most holy Name, And publish in Jerusalem the praises of the same: 22When as the people gather shall in troups with one accord, When Kingdoms shall assembled be to serve the highest Lord. 23My wonted force, &amp; strength he hath abated in the way; And he my dayes hath shortened: 24Thus therefore did I say, My God, in mid-time of my dayes, take thou me not away: From age to age, eternally thy years endure and stay. 25The firm foundation of the earth of old time thou hast laid: The heavens also are the work which thine own hands have made 26Thou shalt for evermore endure, but they shall perish all; Yea, every one of them wax old, like to a garment, shall: Thou as a vesture shalt them change, and they shall changed be. 27But Thou the same art, &amp; thy years are to eternitie. 28The children of thy servants shall continually endure, And in thy sight, O Lord, their seed shall be establisht sure.

Th'afflicteds pray'r he wil not scorn: 18All times this shal be in record, And generations yet unborn Shal praise and magnifie the Lord. 19He fr? his holy place look'd down The earth he view'd fr? heav'n on hie 20To hear the prisoners mourning groan, And free them that are dam'd to die; 21That Zion, and Jerusalem too His Name and praise may wel record, 22When people and the Kingdoms do Assemble all to praise the Lord. 23My strength he weakned in the way My dayes of life he shortened. 24My God, O take me not away In mid-time of my dayes, I said; Thy years throughout all ages last. 25Of old thou hast established The earths foundation firm and fast: Thy mighty hands the heav'ns have made 26They perish shal, as garments do, But thou shalt evermore endure: As vestures, thou shalt change them so And they shal all be changed sure. 27But from all changes thou art free, Thy endlesse years do last ay. 28Thy servants, and their seed who be Establish'd shal before thee stay.

With those that his own servants were to deal in subtilty. 26His servant Moses he did send, Aaron his chosen one: 27By these, his signes &amp; wonders great in Hams land were made known. 28Darkness he sent, and made it dark: his word they did obey. 29He turn'd their waters into bloud, and he their fish did slay. 30The land in plenty brought forth frogs in chambers of their Kings. 31His word all sorts of flies and lice in all their borders brings. 32He hail for rain, and flaming fire into their land he sent: 33And he their vines &amp; fig-trees smote trees of their coasts he rent. 34He spake, and Caterpillers came, Locusts did much abound, 35Which in their land all herbs consum'd and all fruits of their ground. 36He smote al first-born in their land chief of their strength each one. 37With gold &amp; silver broght th? forth weak in their tribes were none. 38Egypt was glad when forth thy went: their fear on them did light. 39He spred a cloud for covering, and fire to shine by night. 40They askt, and he brought Quails; with bread of heav'n he filled them. 41He op'ned rocks, floods gusht, &amp; ran in deserts, like a stream. 42For on his holy promise he, and servant Abraham, thought. 43With joy his people, his elect with gladnesse forth he brought. 44And unto them the pleasant lands he of the heathen gave, That of the peoples labours they inheritance might have; 45That they his statutes might observe according to his word, And that they might his Lawes obey. Give praise unto the Lord. PSAL. CVI.

So was the land defil'd with bloud; 39They stain'd with their own way And with their own inventions a whoring they did stray. 40Against his people kindled was the wrath of God therefore, Insomuch that he did his own inheritance abhore. 41He gave them to the heathens hand their foes did them command: 42Their enemies them opprest, they were made subject to their hand. 43He many times delivered them, but with their counsel, so They him provok'd, that for their sin they were brought very low. 44Yet their affliction he beheld, when he did hear their cry: 45And he for them his Covenant did cal to memory: After his mercies multitude 46he did repent; And made Them to be pity'd of all those who them did captive lead. 47O Lord, our God, us save, &amp; gather the heathen from among, That we thy holy Name may praise in a triumphant song. 48Blest be Jehovah, Israels God, to all eternity: Let all the people say, Amen.

When straits them presse They cry unto the Lord, and he them frees from their distresse. 7Them also in a way to walk, that right is, he did guide, That they might to a city go, wherein they might abide. 8O that men to the Lord would give praise, for his goodnesse, then. And for his works of wonder done unto the sons of men. 9For he the soul that longing is doth fully satisfie, With goodnesse he the hungry soul doth fill abundantly. 10Such as shut up in darknesse deep, and in deaths shade abide, Whom strongly hath affliction bound and irons fast have ty'd 11(Because against the words of God they wrought rebelliously, And they the counsel did contemn of him that is most hie) 12Their heart he did bring down with grief, they fel, no help could have. 13In trouble then they cry'd to God, he them from straits did save. 14He out of darknesse did them bring and from deaths shade them take: These bands where w?? they had been bound, asunder quite he brake. 15O that men to the Lord would give praise, for his goodnesse then, And for his works of wonder done unto the sons of men. 16Because the mighty gates of brasse in pieces he did tear, By him in sunder also cut the bars of iron were. 17Fools for their sin, and their offence do sore affliction bear. 18Al kinde of meat their soul abhors they to deaths gates draw near. 19In grief they cry to God, he saves them from their miseries: 20He sends his word, th? heals, &amp; them from their destructions frees. 21O that men to the Lord would give praise for his goodnesse then, And for his works of wonder done unto the sons of men. 22And let them sacrifice to him off'rings of thankfulnesse, And let them shew abroad his works in songs of joyfulnesse. 23Who go to sea in ships and in great waters trading be, 24Within the deep these men Gods works and his great wonders see. 25For he commands, &amp; forth in haste the stormie tempest flies, W?? makes the sea with rouling waves aloft to swel and rise. 26They mount to heav'n, then to the depths they do go down again. Their soul doth faint, and melt away with trouble and with pain. 27They reel &amp; stagger like one drunk at their wits end they be: 28Then they to God in trouble cry, who them from straits doth free. 29The storm is chang'd into a calm; at his command and wil, So that the waves which rag'd before now quiet are and stil. 30Then are they glad, because at rest and quiet now they be, So to the haven he them brings which they desir'd to see. 31O that men to the Lord would give praise for his goodnesse then, And for his works of wonder, done unto the sons of men. 32Among the people gathered, let them exalt his Name; Among assembled Elders spread his most renowned fame. 33He to dry land turns water-springs and flouds to wildernesse: 34For sins of those that dwel therein fat land to barrennesse. 35The burnt and parched wildernesse to water-pools he brings. The ground that was dry'd up before he turns to water springs. 36And there, for dwelling, he a place doth to the hungry give, That they a city may prepare commodiously to live. 37There sow they fields, &amp; vineyards plant to yeeld fruits of increase. 38His blessing makes them multiply lets not their beasts decrease. 39Again they are diminished, and very low brought down, Through sorrow, and affliction, and great oppression. 40He upon Princes pours contempt and causeth them to stray And wander in a wildernesse, wherein there is no way. 41Yet setteth he the poor on high from all his miseries; And he, much like unto a flock, doth make him families. 42They that are righteous shal rejoyce when they the same shal see; And, as a shamed, stop her mouth shal all iniquitie. 43Who so is wise, &amp; wil these things observe, and them record, Ev'n they shal understand the love and kindnesse of the Lord.

PSAL. CXXI. [1] I to the hils wil lift mine eyes, from whence doth come mine aid: 2My safety cometh from the Lord, who heav'n and earth hath made. 3Thy foot Hee'l not let slide, nor wil he slumber that thee keeps: 4Behold, he that keeps Israel, he slumbers not, nor sleeps. 5The Lord thee keeps, the Lord thy shade on thy right hand doth stay: 6The Moon by night thee shal not smite, nor yet the Sun by day. 7The Lord shal keep thy soul, he shal preserve thee from all ill: 8Hence forth thy going out and in God keep for ever wil. PSAL. CXXII. [1] I joy'd, when to the house of God go up, they said to me. 2Jerusalem within thy gates our feet shal standing be. 3Jerusalem as a city is compactly built together: 4Unto that place the Tribes go up, the Tribes of God go thither, To Israels testimonie, there to Gods Name thanks to pay. 5For thrones of judgement, ev'n the thrones of Davids house there stay. 6Pray that Jerusalem may have peace and felicitie: Let them, that love thee &amp; thy peace, have stil prosperitie. 7Therefore I wish that peace may stil within thy wals remain, And ever may thy palaces prosperitie retain. 8Now for my friends &amp; brethrens sake peace be in thee, I'le say: 9And for the house of God our Lord, I'le seek thy good alway. PSAL CXXIII. [1] O thou that dwellest in the heav'ns, I lift mine eyes to thee. 2Behold, as servants eyes do look their masters hand to see, As hand-maids eyes her mistress hand so do our eyes attend Upon the Lord our God, until to us he mercy send. 3O Lord, be gracious to us, unto us gracious be: Because replenish'd with contempt exceedingly are we. 4Our soul is fill'd with scorn of those that at their ease abide, And with the insolent contempt of those that swel in pride. PSAL CXXIV. [1] Had not the Lord been on our side, may Israel now say: 2Had not the Lord been on our side, when men rose us to slay: 3They had us swallow'd quick, wh? as their wrath 'gainst us did flame: 4Waters had cover'd us, our soul had sunk beneath the stream. 5Then had the waters, swelling high over our soul made way. 6Blest be the Lord, who to their teeth us gave not for a prey. 7Our soul's escaped, as a bird out of the fowlers snare— The snare a sunder broken is, and we escaped are. 8Our sure, and all-sufficient help is in JEHOVAH'S Name; His Name, who did the heav'n create and who the earth did frame. Another of the same. [Now Israel may say and that truly] Now Israel may say and that truly, If that the Lord had not our cause maintain'd: 2If that the Lord had not our right sustain'd, When cruel men against us furiously Rose up in wrath, to make of us their prey. 3Then certainly they had devour'd us all, And swallowed quick, for ought that we could deem; Such was their rage, as we might wel esteem: 4And as fierce flouds before them all things drown: So had they brought our soul to death quite down. 5The raging streams, with their proud swelling waves, Had then our soul ov'rewhelmed in the deep: 6But blest be God. who doth us safely keep, And hath not given us for a living prey Unto their teeth and bloudy cruelty. 7Ev'n as a bird out of the fowlers snare Escapes away, so is our soul set free; Broke are their nets, and thus escaped wee. 8Therefore our help, is in the Lords great Name, Who heav'n and earth by his great pow'r did frame. PSAL. CXXV. [1] They, in the Lord that firmly trust shal be like Zion hil, Which at no time can be remov'd, but standeth ever stil. 2As round about Jerusalem the mountains stand alway, The Lord his folk doth compasse so from henceforth and for ay. 3For ill mens rod upon the lot of just men shal not ly, Lest righteous men stretch forth their hands unto iniquity. 4Do thou to all those that be good thy goodnesse, Lord, impart; And do thou good to those that are upright within their heart. 5But as for such that turn aside after their crooked way, God shal lead forth with wicked men: on Israel peace shal stay. PSAL. CXXVI. [1] Whezions b?dage God turn'd back as men that dream'd were we. 2Th? fil'd w?? laughter was our mouth, our tongue with melodie: They 'mong the heath? said, The Lord great things for them hath wrought: 3The Lord hath don great things forus whence joy to us is brought. 4As streams of water in the South, our bondage, Lord, recal. 5Who sow in tears a reaping time of joy enjoy they shal. 6That man, who bearing precious seed in going forth doth mourn, He doubtlesse, bringing back his sheavs rejoycing shal return. PSAL CXXVII. [1] Except the Lord do build the house the builders lose their pain: Except the Lord the citykeep, the watchmen watch in vain. 2It's vain for you to rise betimes, or late from rest to keep, To feed on sorrows bread: so gives He his beloved sleep. 3Lo, children are Gods heritage, the wombs-fruit His reward. 4The sons of youth as arrows are for strong mens hands prepar'd. 5O happy is the man that hath his quiver fill'd with those: They, unashamed, in the gate shall speak unto their foes. PSAL. CXXVIII. [1] Blest is each one that fears the Lord and walketh in his wayes. 2For of thy labour thou shalt eat, and happie be alwayes. 3Thy wife shall, as a fruitful vine, by thy house sides, be found, Thy children like to olive plants about thy table round. 4Behold, the man that fears the Lord, thus blessed shall he be. 5The Lord shall out of Zion give His blessing unto thee: Thou shalt Jerusalems good behold whilst thou on earth dost dwell. 6Thou shalt thy childrens children see and peace on Israel. PSAL. CXXIX. [1] Oft did they vex me fr? my youth may Israel now declare: 2Oft did they vex me from my youth yet not victorious were. 3The plowers plow'd upon my back, they long their furrows drew. 4The righteous Lord did cut the cords of the ungodly crue. 5Let Zions haters all be turn'd back with confusion. 6As grasse on houses tops be they, which fades ere it be grown: 7Whereof enough to fill his hand the mower cannot finde: Nor can the man his bosome fill, whose work is, sheaves to binde. 8Neither say they who do go by, Gods blessing on you rest; We, in the Name of God, the Lord, do wish you to be blest. PSAL. CXXX. [1] Lord, from the depths to thee I crid 2My voice, Lord, do thou hear: Unto my supplications voyce, give an attentive ear. 3Lord, who shal stand, if thou, O Lord should'st mark iniquitie? 4But yet with Thee forgivenesse is, that fear'd Thou mayest be. 5I wait for God, my soul doth wait, my hope is in His word. 6More then they, that for morning watch, my soul waits for the Lord: I say, more then they that do watch the morning light to see. 7Let Israel hope in the Lord, for with Him mercies be, And plenteous redemption is ever found with him. 8And from all his iniquities he Israel shal redeem. PSAL. CXXXI.
