      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. HIS were the stores of letter'd Time,—compress'd, The mind of ages in a single breast; The glance to catch, the patience to inquire, The sage's temper, and the poet's fire. WRANGHAM. Accomplish'd JONES! whose hand to ev'ry art Could unknown charms and nameless grace impart; —The song to Virtue as the Muses dear; Tho' glowing, chaste; and lovely, though severe. What gorgeous trophies crown his youthful bloom, The spoils august of Athens and of Rome! And, lo! untouch'd by British brows before, Yet nobler trophies wait on Asia's shore; There at his magic voice, what wonders rise! Th'astonish'd East unfolds her mysteries; Round her dark shrines, a sudden blaze he showers, And, all unveil'd, the proud Pantheon towers. GRANT. MISCELLANEOUS POEMS. IMITATION OF HORACE, Ode XIV. Lib. II. WRITTEN AT FOURTEEN YEARS OF AGE. How quickly fades the vital flow'r! Alas, my friend! each silent hour Steals unperceiv'd away: The early joys of blooming youth, Sweet innocence and dove-ey'd truth, Are destin'd to decay. Can zeal, drear Pluto's wrath restrain? No; tho' an hourly victim stain His hallow'd shrine with blood, Fate will recall her doom for none; The sceptred king must leave his throne, To pass the Stygian flood. In vain, my Parnell, wrapt in ease, We shun the merchant-marring seas; In vain, we fly from wars; In vain we shun th'autumnal blast; (The slow Cocytus must be pass'd;) How needless are our cares! Our house, our land, our shadowy grove, The very mistress of our love, Ah me, we soon must leave! Of all our trees, the hated boughs Of Cypress shall alone diffuse Their fragrance o'er our grave. To others shall we then resign The num'rous casks of sparkling wine, Which, frugal, now we store; With them a more deserving heir, (Is this our labour, this our care?) Shall stain the stucco floor. 1760. ARCADIA, A PASTORAL POEM. In those fair plains, where glitt'ring Ladon roll'd His wanton labyrinth o'er sands of gold, Menalcas reign'd: from Pan his lineage came; Rich were his vales, and deathless was his fame. When youth impell'd him, and when love inspir'd, The list'ning nymphs his Doric lays admir'd: To hear his notes the swains with rapture flew; A softer pipe no shepherd ever blew. But, now, oppress'd beneath the load of age, Belov'd, respected, venerable, sage,— This couplet alludes to the higher Idyllia of Theocritus; as the ???????? ??? ??????????, the ??????????, and others which are of the heroic kind.Of heroes, demigods, and gods he sung; His reed neglected on a poplar hung: Yet all the rules, that young Arcadians keep, He kept; and watch'd each morn, his bleating sheep. Two lovely daughters were his dearest care; Both mild as May, and both as April fair: Love, where they mov'd, each youthful breast inflam'd; And Daphne this, and Hyla that was nam'd. The first was bashful as a blooming bride, And all her mien display'd a decent pride; Her tresses, braided in a curious knot, Were close confin'd, and not a hair forgot,— Where many a flower, in mystic order plac'd, With myrtle twin'd, her silken fillet grac'd; Nor with less neatness was her robe dispos'd, And every fold a pleasing art disclos'd; Her sandals of the brightest silk were made, And, as she walk'd, gave lustre to the shade; A graceful ease in every step was seen, She mov'd a shepherdess, yet look'd a queen. Her sister scorn'd to dwell in arching bowers, Or deck her locks with wreaths of fading flowers; O'er her bare shoulder flow'd her auburn hair, And, fann'd by Zephyrs, floated on the air; Green were her buskins, green the vest she wore, And in her hand a knotty crook she bore. The voice of Daphne might all pains disarm: Yet, heard too long, its sweetness ceas'd to charm: But none were tir'd when artless Hyla sung, Though something rustic warbled from her tongue. Thus, both in beauty grew, and both in fame, Their manners different, yet their charms the same. The young Arcadians, tuneful from their birth, To love devoted, and to rural mirth, Beheld, and fondly lov'd the royal maids, And sung their praise in valleys, lawns, and glades;— From morn to latest eve they wept, and sigh'd; And some for Daphne, some for Hyla, died: Each day new presents to the nymphs they bore, And in gay order spread the shining store; Some beechen bowls and polish'd sheephooks brought, With ebon knots, and studs of silver wrought; Some led in flowery bands the playful fawn, Or bounding roe, that spurn'd the grassy lawn; The rest on nature's blooming gifts relied, And rais'd their slender hopes on beauty's pride: —But the coy maids, regardless of their pain, Their vows derided, and their plaintive strain. Hence some, whom love with lighter flames had fir'd, Broke their soft flutes, and in despair retir'd; To milder damsels told their amorous tale, And found a kinder Daphne in the vale. It happen'd, on a cheerful morn of May, When every meadow smil'd in fresh array, The shepherds, rising at an early hour, In crowds assembled round the regal bower, There hail'd in sprightly notes the peerless maids; And tender accents trembled through the glades. Menalcas, whom the larks with many a lay Had call'd from slumber at the dawn of day, By chance was roving through a bordering dale, And heard the swains their youthful woes bewail. He knew the cause; for long his prudent mind To sooth their cares indulgently design'd; Slow he approach'd; then wav'd his awful hand, And, leaning on his crook, address'd the list'ning band:— ‘Arcadian shepherds! to my words attend; ‘In silence, hear your monarch, and your friend. ‘Your fruitless pains, which none can disapprove, ‘Excite my pity, not my anger move. ‘Two gentle maids, the solace of my age, ‘Fill all my soul, and all my care engage; ‘When death shall join me to the pale-ey'd throng, ‘To them my sylvan empire will belong; ‘But, lest with them the royal line should fail, ‘And civil discord fill this happy vale, ‘Two chosen youths the beauteous nymphs must wed, ‘To share their power, and grace the genial bed; ‘So may the swains our ancient laws obey, ‘And all Arcadia own their potent sway. ‘But what sage counsel can their choice direct? ‘Whom can the nymphs prefer, or whom reject? ‘So like your passion, and so like your strain, ‘That all deserve, yet cannot all obtain. ‘Hear then my tale: as late, by fancy led ‘To steep Cyllene's ever-vocal head, ‘With winding steps I wander'd through the wood, ‘And pour'd wild notes; a Faun before me stood; ‘A flute he held, which as he softly blew, ‘The feather'd warblers to the sound he drew; ‘Then to my hand the precious gift consign'd, ‘And said, “Menalcas, ease thy wond'ring mind: “This pipe, on which the god of shepherds play'd, “When love inflam'd him, and the Echo. viewless maid, “Receive: ev'n Pan thy tuneful skill confess'd, “And after Pan thy lips will grace it best. “Thy daughter's beauty every breast inspires, “And all thy kingdom glows with equal fires: “But let those favor'd youths alone succeed, “Who blow with matchless art this heavenly reed.” ‘This said, he disappear'd. Then hear my will; ‘Be bold, ye lovers, and exert your skill; ‘Be they my sons, who sing the softest strains, ‘And tune to sweetest notes their pleasing pains: ‘But mark! whoe'er shall, by too harsh a lay, ‘Offend our ears, and from our manners stray, ‘He, for our favor, and our throne unfit, ‘To some disgraceful penance must submit.’ He ends: the shepherds at his words rejoice, And praise their sovereign with a grateful voice. Each swain believes the lovely prize his own, And sits triumphant on th'ideal throne; Kind Vanity their want of art supplies, And gives indulgent what the Muse denies; Gay vests and flowery garlands each prepares, And each the dress, that suits his fancy, wears. Now deeper blushes ting'd the glowing sky, And evening rais'd her silver lamp on high; When in a bower, by Ladon's lucid stream, Where not a star could dart his piercing beam, So thick the curling eglantines display'd, With woodbines join'd, an aromatic shade,— The father of the blooming nymphs reclin'd, His hoary locks with sacred laurel twin'd: The royal damsels, seated by his side, Shone like two flow'rs in summer's fairest pride: The swains before them crowded in a ring, Prepar'd to blow the flute, or sweetly sing. First, in the midst a graceful youth arose, Born in those fields where crystal Mele flows: His air was courtly, his complexion fair; And rich perfumes shed sweetness from his hair, That o'er his shoulder wav'd in flowing curls, With roses braided, and inwreath'd with pearls: A wand of cedar for his crook he bore; His slender foot th'Arcadian sandal wore, Yet that so rich, it seem'd to fear the ground, With beaming gems and silken ribands bound; The plumage of an ostrich grac'd his head, And with embroider'd flow'rs his mantle was o'erspread. See Bion, Moschus, &amp;c.He sung the darling of th'Idalian queen, Fall'n in his prime on sad Cythera's green; When weeping graces left the faded plains, And tun'd their strings to elegiac strains; While mourning Loves the tender burden bore, ‘Adonis, fair Adonis, charms no more.’ The theme displeas'd the nymph, whose ruder ear The tales of simple shepherds lov'd to hear. The maids and youths, who saw the swain advance, And take the fatal pipe, prepar'd to dance: So wildly, so affectedly, he play'd, His tune so various and uncouth he made, That not a dancer could in cadence move, And not a nymph the quaver'd notes approve: They broke their ranks, and join'd the circling train, While bursts of laughter sounded o'er the plain. Menalcas rais'd his hand, and bade retire The silken courtier from th'Arcadian choir: Two eager shepherds, at the king's command, Rent his gay plume, and snapp'd his polish'd wand; They tore his vest, and o'er his bosom threw A weed of homely grain and russet hue; Then fill'd with wither'd herbs his scented locks, And scornful drove him to the low-brow'd rocks; There doom'd to rove, deserted and forlorn, Till thrice the moon had arch'd her silver-horn. The next that rose, and took the mystic reed, Was wrapp'd, ungraceful, in a sordid weed; A shaggy hide was o'er his shoulder spread; And wreaths of noxious darnel bound his head; Unshorn his beard, and tangled was his hair; He rudely walk'd, and thus address'd the fair: ‘My kids I fondle, and my lambs I kiss; ‘Ah! grant, sweet maid, a more delightful bliss.’ The damsels blush with anger and disdain, And turn indignant from the shameless swain; To Pan in silence, and to Love, they pray, To make his music hateful as his lay. The gods assent: the flute he roughly takes, And scarce, with pain, a grating murmur makes: But when, in jarring notes, he forc'd his song, Just indignation fir'd the rural throng: Shame of Arcadia's bowers! the youths exclaim, Whose tuneless lays disgrace a shepherd's name, The watchful heralds, at Menalcas' nod, Pursued the rustick with a vengeful rod; Condemn'd three summers on the rocky shore To feed his goats, and touch a pipe no more. Now to the ring a portly swain advanc'd, Who neither wholly walk'd nor wholly danc'd; Yet mov'd in pain, so close his crimson vest Was clasp'd uneasy o'er his straining breast: See Tasso, Guarini, Fontinelle, Camoens, Garcilasso, and Lope de la Vega; and other writers of pastorals in Italian, French, Portuguese, and Spansih.‘Fair nymph!’ said he, ‘the roses, which you wear, ‘Your charms improve not, but their own impair.’ The maids, unus'd to flowers of eloquence, Smil'd at the words, but could not guess their sense. When in his hand the sacred reed he took, Long time he view'd it with a pensive look; Then gave it breath, and rais'd a shriller note Than when the bird of morning swells his throat; Through every interval, now low, now high, Swift o'er the stops his fingers seem'd to fly: The youths, who heard such music with surprise, Gaz'd on the tuneful bard with wond'ring eyes: He saw with secret pride their deep amaze, Then said, ‘Arcadia shall resound my praise, ‘And every clime my powerful art shall own; ‘This, this, ye swains, is melody alone: ‘To me Amphion taught the heavenly strains, ‘Amphion, born on rich Hesperian plains.’ To whom Menalcas: ‘Stranger! we admire ‘Thy notes melodious, and thy rapturous fire; ‘But ere to these fair valleys thou return, ‘Adopt our manners, and our language learn: ‘Some aged shepherd shall thy air improve, ‘And teach thee how to speak, and how to move.’ Soon to the bow'r a modest stripling came, Fairest of swains; and The name supposed to be taken by Virgil in his first pastoral. Tityrus his name: Mild was his look: an easy grace he show'd; And o'er his beauteous limbs a decent mantle flow'd: As through the crowd he press'd, the sylvan choir His mien applauded, and his neat attire; And Daphne, yet untaught in amorous lore, Felt strange desires, and pains unknown before. He now begins: the dancing hills attend, And knotty oaks from mountain-tops descend:— He sings of swains beneath the beechen shade, Formosam resonare doces Amaryllida sylvam. Virg.When lovely Amaryllis fill'd the glade; Next, in a sympathizing lay, complains Of love unpitied, and the lover's pains: But when with art the hallow'd pipe he blew, What deep attention hush'd the rival crew! He play'd so sweetly, and so sweetly sung, That on each note th'enraptur'd audience hung; Ev'n blue-hair'd nymphs, from Ladon's limpid stream, Rais'd their bright heads, and listen'd to the theme; Then, through the yielding waves, in transport glanc'd; Whilst on the banks the joyful shepherds danc'd: ‘We oft,’ said they, ‘at close of evening flow'rs, ‘Have heard such music in the vocal bow'rs: ‘We wonder'd: for we thought some amorous god, ‘That on a silver moonbeam swiftly rode, ‘Had fann'd with starry plumes, the floating air, ‘And touch'd his harp, to charm some mortal fair.’ He ended; and, as rolling billows loud, His praise resounded from the circling crowd. The clamorous tumult softly to compose, High in the midst, the plaintive Colin is the name that Spenser takes in his Pastorals; and Rosalinda is that, under which he celebrates his mistress. Colin rose, Born on the lilied banks of royal Thame, Which oft had rung with Rosalinda's name; Fair, yet neglected; neat, yet unadorn'd; The pride of dress, and flowers of art, he scorn'd: And, like the nymph who fir'd his youthful breast, Green were his buskins, green his simple vest: With careless ease his rustic lays he sung, And melody flow'd smoothly from his tongue: Of June's gay fruits and August's corn he told, The bloom of April, and December's cold; See the Shepherd's Kalendar.The loves of shepherds, and their harmless cheer In every month that decks the varied year. Now on the flute with equal grace he play'd, And his soft numbers died along the shade; The skilful dancers to his accents mov'd, And every voice his easy tune approv'd: Ev'n Hyla, blooming maid, admir'd the strain, While through her bosom shot a pleasing pain. Now all were hush'd: no rival durst arise; Pale were their cheeks, and full of tears their eyes. Menalcas, rising from his flowery seat, Thus, with a voice majestically sweet, Address'd th'attentive throng: ‘Arcadians hear! ‘The sky grows dark, and beamy stars appear: ‘Haste to the vale: the bridal bowers prepare: ‘And hail with joy Menalcas' tuneful heir. ‘Thou, Tityrus, of swains the pride and grace, ‘Shalt clasp soft Daphne in thy fond embrace: ‘And thou, young Colin, in thy willing arms ‘Shalt fold my Hyla, fair in native charms. ‘O'er these sweet plains divided empire hold, ‘And to your latest race transmit an age of gold. ‘What splendid visions rise before my sight, ‘And fill my aged bosom with delight! ‘ This prophecy of Menalcas alludes to the Æneid of Virgil, and the Fairy-Queen of Spenser.Henceforth of wars and conquests shall you sing, ‘Arms and the Man in every clime shall ring: ‘Thy muse, bold Maro, Tityrus no more, ‘Shall tell of chiefs that left the Phrygian shore, ‘Sad Dido's love, and Venus' wandering son, ‘The Latians vanquish'd, and Lavinia won. ‘And thou, O Colin! heaven-defended youth, ‘Shalt hide in fiction's veil the charms of truth; ‘Thy notes the sting of sorrow shall beguile, ‘And smooth the brow of anguish till it smile; ‘Notes, that a sweet Elysian dream can raise, ‘And lead th'enchanted soul through fancy's maze; ‘Thy verse shall shine with Gloriana's name, ‘And fill the world with Britain's endless fame.’ To Tityrus, then, he gave the sacred flute, And bade his sons their blushing brides salute; Whilst all the train a lay of triumph sung, Till mountains echo'd, and till valleys rung. While thus, with mirth, they tun'd the nuptial strain, A youth, too late, was hastening o'er the plain, Clad in a flowing vest of azure hue; See Sannazaro, Ongaro, Phineas Fletcher, and other writers of piscatory eclogues.Blue were his sandals, and his girdle blue: A slave, ill-dress'd and mean, behind him bore An osier-basket, fill'd with fishy store,— The lobster with his sable armour bold; The tasteful mullet, deck'd with scales of gold; Bright perch, the tyrants of the finny breed; And greylings sweet, that crop the fragrant weed: Among them shells of many a tint appear; Venus's heart and Venus's ear are the names of two very beautiful shells.The heart of Venus, and her pearly ear; The nautilus, on curling billows born; And scallops, by the wandering pilgrim worn; Some dropp'd with silver, some with purple dye; With all the race that seas or streams supply:— A net and angle o'er his shoulder hung: Thus was the stranger clad:—and thus he sung: ‘Ah! lovely damsel, leave thy simple sheep; ‘'Tis sweeter in the sea-worn rock to sleep; ‘There, shall thy line the scaly shoals betray, ‘And sports, unknown before, beguile the day: ‘To guide o'er rolling waves the dancing skiff, ‘Or pluck the samphire from th'impending cliff: ‘My rapturous notes the blue-ey'd Nereids praise, ‘And silver-footed Naiads hear my lays.’ ‘To them,’ Menalcas said, ‘thy numbers pour; ‘Insult our flocks and blissful vales no more.’ He spoke: the heralds knew their sovereign's will, And hurl'd the fisher down the sloping hill: Headlong he plung'd beneath the liquid plain; (But not a nymph receiv'd the falling swain;) Then, dropping, rose; and, like the rushing wind, Impetuous fled, nor cast a look behind; This alludes to the Latin compositions of Sannazarius; which have great merit in their kind.He sought the poplar'd banks of winding Po, But shunn'd the meads where Ladon's waters flow. Ere through nine radiant signs the flaming sun His course resplendent in the Zodiac run, The royal damsels, bashful now no more, Two lovely boys on one glad morning bore; From blooming Daphne fair Alexis sprung, And Colinet on Hyla's bosom hung; Both o'er the vales of sweet Arcadia reign'd, And both the manners of their sires retain'd: See Pope's Pastorals.Alexis, fairer than a morn of May, In glades and forests tun'd his rural lay, More soft than rills that through the valley flow, Or vernal gales that o'er the violets blow; He sung the tender woes of artless swains, Their tuneful contests, and their amorous pains; When early spring has wak'd the breathing flow'rs, Or winter hangs with frost the silv'ry bow'rs:— See the Shepherd's Week, of Gay.But Colinet in ruder numbers tells The loves of rustics, and fair-boding spells: Sings how they simply pass the livelong day, And softly mourn, or innocently play. Since them no shepherd rules th'Arcadian mead, But silent hangs Menalcas' fatal reed. CAISSA: OR, THE GAME OF CHESS. A POEM, Written in 1763. Of armies on the chequer'd field array'd, And guiltless war in pleasing form display'd; When two bold kings contend with vain alarms, In ivory this, and that in ebon arms; Sing, sportive maids, that haunt the sacred hill Of Pindus, and the fam'd Pierian rill. Thou, joy of all below, and all above, Mild Venus, queen of laughter, queen of love; Leave thy bright island, where on many a rose And many a pink thy blooming train repose: Assist me, goddess! since a lovely pair Command my song, like thee divinely fair. Near yon cool stream, whose living waters play, And rise translucent, in the solar ray; Beneath the covert of a fragrant bow'r, Where spring's soft influence purpled every flow'r; Two smiling nymphs reclin'd in calm retreat, And envying blossoms crowded round their seat; Here, Delia was enthron'd; and, by her side, The sweet Sirena; both, in beauty's pride: Thus shine two roses, fresh with early bloom, That from their native stalk dispense perfume; Their leaves unfolding to the dawning day, Gems of the glowing mead, and eyes of May. A band of youths and damsels sat around, Their flowing locks with braided myrtle bound; Agatis, in the graceful dance admir'd, And gentle Thyrsis, by the muse inspir'd; With Sylvia, fairest of the mirthful train; And Daphnis, doom'd to love, yet love in vain. Now, whilst a purer blush o'erspreads her cheeks, With soothing accents thus Sirena speaks: ‘The meads and lawns are ting'd with beamy light, ‘And wakeful larks begin their vocal flight; ‘Whilst on each bank the dew-drops sweetly smile; ‘What sport, my Delia, shall the hours beguile? ‘Shall heavenly notes, prolong'd with various art, ‘Charm the fond ear, and warm the rapturous heart? ‘At distance shall we view the sylvan chase; ‘Or catch with silken lines the finny race?’ Then Delia thus: ‘Or, rather since we meet ‘By chance assembled in this cool retreat, ‘In artful contest let our warlike train ‘Move, well-directed, o'er the color'd plain; ‘Daphnis, who taught us first, the play shall guide; ‘Explain its laws, and o'er the field preside: ‘No prize we need, our ardor to inflame; ‘We fight with pleasure, if we fight for fame.’ The nymph consents: the maids and youths prepare To view the combat, and the sport to share; But Daphnis most approv'd the bold design, Whom Love instructed, and the tuneful Nine. He rose; and on the cedar table plac'd A polish'd board, with diff'ring colors grac'd; Squares eight times eight in equal order lie; These bright as snow, those dark with sable dye; Like the broad target by the tortoise born, Or like the hide by spotted panthers worn. Then from a chest, with harmless heroes stor'd, O'er the smooth plain two well-wrought hosts he pour'd; The champions burn'd, their rivals to assail, Twice eight in black, twice eight in milkwhite mail; In shape and station different, as in name, Their motions various, nor their pow'r the same. Say, muse! (for Jove has nought from thee conceal'd) Who form'd the legions on the level field? High in the midst, the reverend kings appear, And o'er the rest their pearly sceptres rear: One solemn step, majestically slow, They gravely move, and shun the dangerous foe; If e'er they call, the watchful subjects spring, And die with rapture if they save their king; On him the glory of the day depends, He once imprison'd, all the conflict ends. The queens exulting near their consorts stand; Each bears a deadly falchion in her hand; Now here, now there, they bound with furious pride, And thin the trembling ranks from side to side; Swift as Camilla flying o'er the main, Or lightly skimming o'er the dewy plain: Fierce as they seem, some bold Plebeian spear May pierce their shield, or stop their full career. The valiant guards, their minds on havoc bent, Fill the next squares, and watch the royal tent; Though weak their spears, though dwarfish be their height, The chief art in the Tactics of Chess consists, in the nice conduct of the royal pawns; in supporting them against every attack; and, if they are taken, in supplying their places with others equally supported: a principle, on which the success of the game in great measure depends, though it seems to be omitted by the very accurate Vida.Compact they move, the bulwark of the fight. To right and left the martial wings display Their shining arms, and stand in close array. Behold! four archers, eager to advance, Send the light reed, and rush with sidelong glance; Through angles, ever, they assault the foes, True to the color, which at first they chose. Then four bold knights, for courage fam'd and speed, Each knight exalted on a prancing steed: Their arching course no vulgar limit knows, Transverse they leap, and aim insidious blows: Nor friends, nor foes, their rapid force restrain, By one quick bound two changing squares they gain; From varying hues renew the fierce attack, And rush from black to white, from white to black. Four solemn elephants the sides defend; Beneath the load of pond'rous towers they bend: In one unalter'd line they tempt the fight; Now crush the left, and now o'erwhelm the right. Bright in the front the dauntless soldiers raise Their polish'd spears; their steely helmets blaze: Prepar'd they stand the daring foe to strike, Direct their progress, but their wounds oblique. Now swell the embattled troops with hostile rage, And clang their shields, impatient to engage; When Daphnis thus: “A varied plain behold, Where fairy kings their mimic tents unfold, As Oberon, and Mab, his wayward queen, Lead forth their armies on the daisied green. No mortal had the wondrous sport contriv'd, By gods invented, and from gods deriv'd; From them the British nymphs receiv'd the game, And play each morn beneath the crystal Thame; Hear then the tale, which they to Colin sung, As idling o'er the lucid wave he hung: A lovely Dryad rang'd the Thracian wild, Her air enchanting and her aspect mild; To chase the bounding hart was all her joy, Averse from Hymen, and the Cyprian boy; O'er hills and valleys was her beauty fam'd, And fair Caïssa was the damsel nam'd. Mars saw the maid; with deep surprise he gaz'd, Admir'd her shape, and every gesture prais'd: His golden bow the child of Venus bent, And through his breast a piercing arrow sent: The reed was Hope; the feathers, keen Desire; The point, her eyes; the barbs, ethereal fire. Soon to the nymph he pour'd his tender strain; The haughty Dryad scorn'd his amorous pain: He told his woes, where'er the maid he found, And still he press'd, yet still Caïssa frown'd; But ev'n her frowns (ah, what might smiles have done!) Fir'd all his soul, and all his senses won. He left his car, by raging tygers drawn, And lonely wander'd o'er the dusky lawn; Then lay desponding near a murmuring stream, And fair Caïssa was his plaintive theme. A Naiad heard him from her mossy bed, And through the crystal rais'd her placid head; Then mildly spake: ‘O thou, whom love inspires, ‘Thy tears will nourish, not allay thy fires. ‘The smiling blossoms drink the pearly dew; ‘And ripening fruit the feather'd race pursue; ‘The scaly shoals devour the silken weeds; ‘Love on our sighs, and on our sorrow feeds. ‘Then weep no more; but, ere thou canst obtain ‘Balm to thy wounds, and solace to thy pain, ‘With gentle art thy martial look beguile; ‘Be mild, and teach thy rugged brow to smile. ‘Canst thou no play, no soothing game devise, ‘To make thee lovely in the damsel's eyes? ‘So may thy prayers assuage the scornful dame, ‘And ev'n Caïssa own a mutual flame.’ ‘Kind nymph,’ said Mars, ‘thy counsel I approve; ‘Art, only art, her ruthless breast can move. ‘But when? or how? Thy dark discourse explain: ‘So may thy stream ne'er swell with gushing rain; ‘So may thy waves in one pure current flow, ‘And flowers eternal on thy border blow!’ To whom the maid replied with smiling mien: ‘Above the palace of the Paphian queen ‘Love's brother dwells, a boy of graceful port, ‘By gods nam'd Euphron, and by mortals Sport: ‘Seek him; to faithful ears unfold thy grief, ‘And hope, ere morn return, a sweet relief. ‘His temple hangs below the azure skies; ‘See'st thou yon argent cloud? 'Tis there it lies.’ This said, she sunk beneath the liquid plain, And sought the mansion of her blue-hair'd train. Meantime the god, elate with heart-felt joy, Had reach'd the temple of the sportful boy; He told Caïssa's charms, his kindled fire, The Naiad's counsel, and his warm desire. ‘Be swift,’ he added, ‘give my passion aid; ‘A god requests.’—He spake, and Sport obey'd. He fram'd a tablet of celestial mould, Inlay'd with squares of silver and of gold; Then of two metals form'd the warlike band, That here, compact, in show of battle stand; He taught the rules that guide the pensive game, And call'd it Cassa from the Dryad's name: (Whence Albion's sons, who most its praise confess, Approv'd the play, and nam'd it thoughtful Chess.) The god delighted, thank'd indulgent Sport; Then grasp'd the board, and left his airy court. With radiant feet he pierc'd the clouds; nor stay'd, Till in the woods he saw the beauteous maid: Tir'd with the chase the damsel sat reclin'd, Her girdle loose, her bosom unconfin'd. He took the figure of a wanton Faun, And stood before her on the flowery lawn; Then show'd his tablet: pleas'd, the nymph survey'd The lifeless troops, in glittering ranks display'd; She ask'd the wily sylvan to explain The various motions of the splendid train: With eager heart she caught the winning lore, And thought ev'n Mars less hateful than before: ‘What spell,’ said she, ‘deceiv'd my careless mind? ‘The god was fair, and I was most unkind.’ She spoke, and saw the changing Faun assume A milder aspect, and a fairer bloom; His wreathing horns, that from his temples grew, Flow'd down in curls of bright celestial hue; The dappled hairs, that veil'd his loveless face, Blaz'd into beams, and show'd a heavenly grace; The shaggy hide, that mantled o'er his breast, Was soften'd to a smooth transparent vest, That through its folds his vigorous bosom show'd, And nervous limbs, where youthful ardor glow'd: (Had Venus view'd him in those blooming charms, Not Vulcan's net had forc'd her from his arms.) With goat-like feet no more he mark'd the ground, But braided flowers his silken sandals bound. The Dryad blush'd; and as he press'd her, smil'd, Whilst all his cares one tender glance beguil'd.” He ends; To arms! the maids and striplings cry; To arms! the groves and sounding vales reply. Sirena led to war the swarthy crew, And Delia those that bore the lily's hue. Who first, O muse! began the bold attack; The white refulgent, or the mournful black? Fair Delia first, as favoring lots ordain, Moves her pale legions tow'rd the sable train: From thought to thought her lively fancy flies, Whilst o'er the board she darts her sparkling eyes. At length the warrior moves with haughty strides; Who from the plain the snowy king divides: With equal haste his swarthy rival bounds; His quiver rattles, and his buckler sounds: Ah! hapless youths, with fatal warmth you burn; Laws, ever fix'd, forbid you to return. Then from the wing a short-liv'd spearman flies, Unsafely bold, and see! he dies, he dies: The dark-brow'd hero, with one vengeful blow, Of life and place deprives his ivory foe. Now rush both armies o'er the burnish'd field, Hurl the swift dart, and rend the bursting shield. Here furious knights on fiery coursers prance, Here archers spring, and lofty towers advance. But see! the white-rob'd Amazon beholds Where the dark host its opening van unfolds: Soon as her eye discerns the hostile maid, By ebon shield, and ebon helm betray'd; Seven squares she passes with majestic mien, And stands triumphant o'er the falling queen. Perplex'd, and sorrowing at his consort's fate, The monarch burn'd with rage, despair, and hate: Swift from his zone th'avenging blade he drew, And, mad with ire, the proud virago slew. Meanwhile sweet-smiling Delia's wary king Retir'd from fight behind his circling wing. Long time the war in equal balance hung; Till, unforeseen, an ivory courser sprung, And, wildly prancing in an evil hour, Attack'd at once the monarch and the tower: Sirena blush'd; for, as the rules requir'd, Her injur'd sovereign to his tent retir'd; Whilst her lost castle leaves his threat'ning height, And adds new glory to th'exulting knight. At this, pale fear oppress'd the drooping maid, And on her cheek the rose began to fade: A crystal tear, that stood prepar'd to fall, She wip'd in silence, and conceal'd from all; From all but Daphnis: He remark'd her pain, And saw the weakness of her ebon train; Then gently spoke: ‘Let me your loss supply, ‘And either nobly win, or nobly die; ‘Me oft has fortune crown'd with fair success, ‘And led to triumph in the fields of Chess.’ He said: the willing nymph her place resign'd, And sat at distance on the bank reclin'd. Thus, when Minerva call'd her chief to arms, And Troy's high turret shook with dire alarms, The Cyprian goddess, wounded, left the plain, And Mars engag'd a mightier force in vain. Strait Daphnis leads his squadron to the field; (To Delia's arms 'tis ev'n a joy to yield.) Each guileful snare, and subtle art he tries, But finds his art less powerful than her eyes: Wisdom and strength superior charms obey: And beauty, beauty, wins the long-fought day. By this,—a hoary chief, on slaughter bent, Approach'd the gloomy king's unguarded tent; Where, late, his consort spread dismay around, Now her dark corse lies bleeding on the ground. Hail, happy youth! thy glories not unsung Shall live eternal on the poet's tongue; For thou shalt soon receive a splendid change, And o'er the plain with nobler fury range. The swarthy leaders saw the storm impend, And strove in vain their sovereign to defend: Th'invader wav'd his silver lance in air, And flew like lightning to the fatal square; His limbs, dilated, in a moment grew To stately height, and widen'd to the view; More fierce his look, more lion-like his mien, Sublime he mov'd, and seem'd a warrior queen. As when the sage on some unfolding plant Has caught a wand'ring fly, or frugal ant, His hand the microscopic frame applies, And, lo! a bright-hair'd monster meets his eyes; He sees new plumes in slender cases roll'd; Here stain'd with azure, there bedropp'd with gold; Thus, on the alter'd chief both armies gaze, And both the kings are fix'd with deep amaze. The sword, which arm'd the snow-white maid before, He now assumes, and hurls the spear no more; Then springs indignant on the dark-rob'd band, And knights and archers feel his deadly hand. Now flies the monarch of the sable shield, His legions vanquish'd, o'er the lonely field; So when the morn, by rosy coursers drawn, With pearls and rubies sows the verdant lawn, Whilst each pale star from heaven's blue vault retires, Still Venus gleams, and last of all expires. He hears, where'er he moves, the dreadful sound; Check the deep vales, and Check the woods rebound:— No place remains: he sees the certain fate, And yields his throne to ruin, and Checkmate. A brighter blush o'erspreads the damsel's cheeks, And mildly thus the conquer'd stripling speaks: ‘A double triumph, Delia, hast thou won, ‘By Mars protected, and by Venus' son; ‘The first with conquest crowns thy matchless art, ‘The second points those eyes at Daphnis' heart.’ She smil'd; the nymphs and amorous youths arise, And own, that beauty gain'd the nobler prize. Low in their chest the mimic troops were lay'd, A parody of the last line in Pope's translation of the Iliad, ‘And peaceful slept the mighty Hector's shade.’And peaceful slept the sable hero's shade. THE SEVEN FOUNTAINS; AN EASTERN ALLEGORY: WRITTEN IN 1767. Deck'd with fresh garlands like a rural bride, And with the crimson streamer's waving pride, A wanton bark was floating o'er the main; And seem'd with scorn, to view the azure plain: Smooth were the waves; and scarce a whispering gale Fann'd with his gentle plumes the silken sail. High, on the burnish'd deck, a gilded throne With orient pearls and beaming diamonds shone; On which reclin'd a youth of graceful mien, His sandals purple, and his mantle green; His locks, in ringlets, o'er his shoulders roll'd, And on his cheek appear'd the downy gold. Around him stood a train of smiling boys, Sporting with idle cheer and mirthful toys; The follies of youth.Ten comely striplings, girt with spangled wings, Blew piercing flutes, or touch'd the quiv'ring strings; Ten more, in cadence to the sprightly strain, Wak'd with their golden oars the slumb'ring main: The waters yielded to their guiltless blows, And the green billows sparkled as they rose. Long time the barge had danc'd along the deep, And on its glassy bosom seem'd to sleep; The world.But, now, a glittering isle arose in view, Bounded with hillocks of a verdant hue: Fresh groves and roseate bowers appear'd above; (Fit haunts, be sure, of pleasure and of love;) And, higher still, a thousand blazing spires Seem'd with gilt tops to threat the heavenly fires. Now, each fair stripling plied his laboring oar, And strait the pinnace struck the sandy shore. The youth arose, and, leaping on the strand, Took his lone way along the silver sand; While the light bark, and all the airy crew, Sunk like a mist beneath the briny dew. With eager steps, the young adventurer stray'd Through many a grove, and many a winding glade: At length, he heard the chime of tuneful strings, That sweetly floated on the Zephyr's wings; The follies and vanities of the world.And, soon, a band of damsels blithe and fair, With flowing mantles and dishevel'd hair, Rush'd, with quick pace, along the solemn wood, Where rapt in wonder and delight he stood: In loose transparent robes they were array'd, Which half their beauties hid, and half display'd. A lovely nymph approach'd him with a smile, And said, ‘O, welcome to this blissful isle; ‘For thou art he, whom ancient bards foretold, ‘Doom'd in our clime to bring an age of gold: ‘Hail, sacred king! and from thy subject's hand, ‘Accept the robes and sceptre of the land.’ ‘Sweet maid,’ said he, ‘fair learning's heavenly beam O'er my young mind ne'er shed her favoring gleam; ‘Nor has my arm e'er hurl'd the fatal lance, ‘While desperate legions o'er the plain advance. ‘How should a simple youth, unfit to bear ‘The steely mail, that splendid mantle wear!’ ‘Ah!’ said the damsel, ‘from this happy shore, ‘We banish wisdom, and her idle lore; ‘No clarions here the strains of battle sing,— ‘With notes of mirth our joyful valleys ring. ‘Peace to the brave:—o'er us, the beauteous reign, ‘And ever-charming pleasures form our train.’ This said, a diadem, inlay'd with pearls, She plac'd respectful on his golden curls; Another, o'er his graceful shoulder, threw A silken mantle of the rose's hue, Which, clasp'd with studs of gold, behind him flow'd, And through the folds his glowing bosom show'd. Then in a car, by snow-white coursers drawn, They led him o'er the dew-besprinkled lawn, Through groves of joy and arbors of delight, With all that could allure his ravish'd sight; Green hillocks, meads, and rosy grots he view'd, And verdurous plains with winding streams bedew'd. On every bank, and under every shade, A thousand youths, a thousand damsels play'd; Some wantonly were tripping in a ring On the soft border of a gushing spring; While some, reclining in the shady vales, Told to their smiling loves their amorous tales: But when the sportful train beheld from far The nymphs returning with the stately car, O'er the smooth plain with hasty steps they came, And hail'd their youthful king with loud acclaim; With flow'rs of every tint the paths they strow'd, And cast their chaplets on the hallow'd road. At last, they reach'd the bosom of a wood, Where, on a hill, a radiant palace stood; A sumptuous dome, by hands immortal made, Which, on its walls and on its gates, display'd The gems that in the rocks of Tibet glow, The pearls that in the shells of Ormus grow. And now a numerous train advance to meet The youth, descending from his regal seat; Whom to a rich and spacious hall they led, With silken carpets delicately spread: There on a throne with gems unnumber'd grac'd, Their lovely king six blooming damsels plac'd The pleasures of the senses., And, meekly kneeling, to his modest hand They gave the glitt'ring sceptre of command; Then on six smaller thrones they sat reclin'd, And watch'd the rising transports of his mind: When thus the youth a blushing nymph address'd, And, as he spoke, her hand with rapture press'd: ‘Say, gentle damsel, may I ask unblam'd ‘How this gay isle, and splendid seats, are nam'd? ‘And you, fair queens of beauty and of grace, ‘Are you of earthly or celestial race? ‘To me the world's bright treasures were unknown, ‘Where late I wander'd, pensive and alone; ‘And, slowly winding on my native shore, ‘Saw the vast ocean roll, but saw no more; ‘Till from the waves with many a charming song, ‘A barge arose, and gayly mov'd along; ‘The jolly rowers reach'd the yielding sands, ‘Allur'd my steps, and wav'd their shining hands: ‘I went, saluted by the vocal train, ‘And the swift pinnace cleav'd the waves again; ‘When on this island struck the gilded prow, ‘I landed full of joy: the rest you know. ‘Short is the story of my tender years: ‘Now speak, sweet nymph, and charm my listening ears.’ ‘These are the groves, for ever deck'd with flowers,’— The maid replied, ‘and these the fragrant bowers,— ‘Where Love and Pleasure hold their airy court, ‘The seat of bliss, of sprightliness, and sport; ‘And we, dear youth! are nymphs of heavenly line; ‘Our souls immortal, as our forms divine: ‘For Maia, fill'd with Zephyr's warm embrace, ‘In caves and forests cover'd her disgrace; ‘At last she rested on this peaceful shore, ‘Where, in yon grot, a lovely boy she bore, ‘Whom, fresh and wild and frolique from his birth, ‘She nurs'd in myrtle bowers, and call'd him Mirth. ‘He on a summer's morning chanc'd to rove ‘Through the green labyrinth of some shady grove, ‘Where, by a dimpled rivulet's verdant side, ‘A rising bank, with woodbine edg'd, he spied: ‘There, veil'd with flowerets of a thousand hues, ‘A nymph lay bath'd in slumber's balmy dews; ‘(This maid by some, for some our race defame, ‘Was Folly call'd, but Pleasure was her name:) ‘Her mantle, like the sky in April, blue, ‘Hung on a blossom'd branch that near her grew; ‘For, long disporting in the silver stream, ‘She shunn'd the blazing day-star's sultry beam; ‘And, ere she could conceal her naked charms, ‘Sleep caught her trembling in his downy arms: ‘Born in the wings of Love, he flew and press'd ‘Her breathing bosom to his eager breast. ‘At his wild theft the rosy morning blush'd, ‘The rivulet smil'd, and all the woods were hush'd. ‘Of these fair parents, on this blissful coast, ‘(Parents like Mirth and Pleasure who can boast!) ‘I with five sisters, on one happy morn, ‘All fair alike, behold us now! were born. ‘When they to brighter regions took their way, ‘By Love invited to the realms of day, ‘To us they gave this large, this gay domain, ‘And said, departing, Here let Beauty reign. ‘Then reign, fair prince! in thee all beauties shine, ‘And, ah! we know thee of no mortal line.’ She said: the king with rapid ardor glow'd, And the swift poison through his bosom flow'd: But, while she spoke, he cast his eyes around To view the dazzling roof, and spangled ground; Then, turning with amaze from side to side, Seven golden doors, that richly shone, he spied, And said, ‘Fair nymph, (but let me not be bold,) ‘What mean those doors that blaze with burnish'd gold?’ ‘To six gay bowers,’ the maid replied, ‘they lead, ‘Where Spring eternal crowns the glowing mead; ‘Six fountains there, that glitter as they play, ‘Rise to the sun with many a color'd ray.’ ‘But the seventh door,’ said he, ‘what beauties grace?’ “O, 'tis a cave; a dark and joyless place, “A scene of nameless deeds, and magic spells, “Where day ne'er shines, and pleasure never dwells: “Think not of that. But come, my royal friend, “And see what joys thy favor'd steps attend.” She spoke; and pointed to the nearest door: Swift he descends; the damsel flies before; She turns the lock; it opens at command; The maid and stripling enter hand in hand. The wondering youth beheld an opening glade, Where in the midst a crystal fountain play'd Sight.; The silver sands, that on its bottom grew, Were strown with pearls and gems of varied hue; The diamonds sparkled like the star of day, And the soft topaz shed a golden ray; Clear amethysts combin'd their purple gleam With the mild emerald's sight-refreshing beam; The sapphire smil'd like yon blue plain above, And rubies spread the blushing tint of love. ‘These are the waters of eternal light,’ The damsel said, ‘the stream of heavenly sight; ‘See, in this cup,’ (she spoke, and stoop'd to fill A vase of jasper with the sacred rill,) ‘See, how the living waters bound and shine, ‘Which this well-polish'd gem can scarce confine!’ From her soft hand, the lucid urn he took, And quaff'd the nectar with a tender look: Strait from his eyes a cloud of darkness flew, And all the scene was open'd to his view; Not all the groves, where ancient bards have told, Of vegetable gems, and blooming gold; Not all the bowers which, oft, in flowery lays And solemn tales Arabian poets praise— Though streams of honey flow'd through every mead, Though balm and amber dropp'd from every reed; Held half the sweets that Nature's ample hand Had pour'd luxuriant o'er this wondrous land All flowerets here their mingled rays diffuse, The rainbow's tints to these were vulgar hues; All birds that in the stream their pinion dip, Or from the brink the liquid crystal sip, Or show their beauties to the sunny skies, Here wav'd their plumes that shone with varying dyes; But chiefly he, that o'er the verdant plain Spreads the gay eyes which grace his spangled train; And he, who, proudly sailing, loves to show His mantling wings and neck of downy snow; Nor absent he, who learns the human sound, With wavy gold and moving emeralds crown'd: Whose head and breast with polish'd sapphires glow, And on whose wing the gems of Indus grow. The monarch view'd their beauties o'er and o'er, He was all eye, and look'd from every pore. But now the damsel calls him from his trance; And o'er the lawn, delighted, they advance: They pass the hall adorn'd with royal state, And enter now with joy, the second gate Hearing.. A soothing sound he heard, (but tasted first The gushing stream that from the valley burst,) And in the shade beheld a youthful quire That touch'd with flying hands the trembling lyre: Melodious notes, drawn out with magic art, Caught with sweet ecstacy his ravish'd heart; An hundred nymphs their charming descants play'd, And melting voices died along the glade; The tuneful stream that murmur'd as it rose, The birds that on the trees bewail'd their woes, The boughs, made vocal by the whispering gale, Join'd their soft strain, and warbled through the vale. The concert ends: and now the stripling hears A tender voice that strikes his wondering ears; A beauteous bird, in our rude climes unknown, That on a leafy arbor sits alone, Strains his sweet throat, and waves his purple wings, And thus in human accents softly sings: ‘Rise, lovely pair, a sweeter bower invites ‘Your eager steps, a bower of new delights; ‘Ah! crop the flowers of pleasure while they blow, ‘Ere winter hides them in a veil of snow. ‘Youth, like a thin anemone, displays ‘His silken leaf, and in a morn decays. ‘See, gentle youth! a lily-bosom'd bride; ‘See, nymph! a blooming stripling by thy side. ‘Then haste, and bathe your souls in soft delights, ‘A sweeter bow'r your wandering steps invites.’ He ceas'd; the slender branch, from which he flew, Bent its fair head, and sprinkled pearly dew. The damsel smil'd; the blushing youth was pleas'd, And by her willing hand his charmer seiz'd: The lovely nymph, who sigh'd for sweeter joy, To the third gate Smell. conducts the amorous boy; She turns the key; her cheeks like roses bloom, And on the lock her fingers drop perfume. His ravish'd sense a scene of pleasure meets, A maze of joy, a paradise of sweets; But first his lips had touch'd th'alluring stream, That through the grove display'd a silver gleam. Through jasmine bowers, and violet-scented vales, On silken pinions flew the wanton gales,— Arabian odors on the plants they left, And whisper'd to the woods their spicy theft: Beneath the shrubs, that spread a trembling shade, The musky roes, and fragrant civets play'd. As when, at eve, an Eastern merchant roves From Hadramut to Aden's spikenard groves, Where some rich caravan, not long before, Has pass'd, with cassia fraught, and balmy store,— Charm'd with the scent that hills and vales diffuse, His grateful journey gayly he pursues; Thus pleas'd, the monarch fed his eager soul, And from each breeze a cloud of fragrance stole: Soon the fourth door Taste. he pass'd with eager haste, And the fourth stream was nectar to his taste. Before his eyes, on agate columns rear'd, On high a purple canopy appear'd; And under it, in stately form, was plac'd A table with a thousand vases grac'd; Laden with all the dainties that are found In air, in seas, or on the fruitful ground. Here the fair youth reclin'd with decent pride, His wanton nymph was seated by his side: All that could please the taste the happy pair Cull'd from the loaded board with curious care; O'er their enchanted heads, a mantling vine His curling tendrils wove with amorous twine; From the green stalks the glowing clusters hung, Like rubies on a thread of emeralds strung; With these were other fruits of every hue, The pale, the red, the golden, and the blue. An hundred smiling pages stood around, Their shining brows with wreaths of myrtle bound: They, in transparent cups of agate, bore Of sweetly-sparkling wines a precious store; The stripling sipp'd and revel'd, till the sun Down heaven's blue vault his daily course had run; Then rose, and, follow'd by the gentle maid, Op'd the fifth door Touch.: a stream before them play'd. The king, impatient for the cooling draught, In a full cup the mystic nectar quaff'd; Then with a smile, (he knew no higher bliss,) From her sweet lip he stole a balmy kiss: On the smooth bank of violets they reclin'd; And, whilst a chaplet for his brow she twin'd, With his soft cheek her softer cheek he press'd; His pliant arms were folded round her breast. She smil'd; soft lightning darted from her eyes, And from his fragrant seat she bade him rise; Then, while a brighter blush her face o'erspread, To the sixth gate The sensual pleasures united. her willing guest she led. The golden lock she softly turn'd around; The moving hinges gave a pleasing sound: The boy delighted ran with eager haste, And to his lips the living fountain plac'd; The magic water pierc'd his kindled brain, And a strange venom shot from vein to vein. Whatever charms he saw in other bowers, Were here combin'd, fruits, music, odors, flowers; A couch besides, with softest silk o'erlaid; And, sweeter still, a lovely yielding maid,— Who now more charming seem'd, and not so coy, And in her arms infolds the blushing boy: They sport and wanton, till, with sleep oppress'd, Like two fresh rose-buds on one stalk, they rest. When morning spread around her purple flame, To the sweet couch the five fair sisters came; They hail'd the bridegroom with a cheerful voice, And bade him make, with speed, a second choice. Hard task to choose, when all alike were fair! Now this, now that, engag'd his anxious care: Then to the first who spoke, his hand he lent; The rest retir'd, and whisper'd as they went. The prince enamour'd view'd his second bride; They left the bower, and wander'd side by side; With her he charm'd his ears, with her his sight; With her he pass'd the day, with her the night. Thus, all by turns the sprightly stranger led, And all by turns partook his nuptial bed; Hours, days, and months, in pleasure flow'd away; All laugh'd, all sweetly sung, and all were gay. So had he wanton'd threescore days and seven, More blest, he thought, than any son of heaven: Till on a morn, with sighs and streaming tears, The train of nymphs before his bed appears; And thus the youngest of the sisters speaks, Whilst a sad shower runs trickling down her cheeks: ‘A custom which we cannot, dare not fail, ‘(Such are the laws that in our isle prevail,) ‘Compels us, prince! to leave thee here alone, ‘Till thrice the sun his rising front has shown: ‘Our parents, whom, alas! we must obey, ‘Expect us at a splendid feast to-day; ‘What joy to us can all their splendor give? ‘With thee, with only thee, we wish to live. ‘Yet may we hope, these gardens will afford ‘Some pleasing solace to our absent lord! Six golden keys, that ope yon blissful gates, ‘Where joy, eternal joy, thy steps awaits, ‘Accept: the seventh (but that you heard before) ‘Leads to a cave, where ravening monsters roar; ‘A sullen, dire, inhospitable cell, ‘Where deathful spirits and magicians dwell. ‘Farewel, dear youth!—how will our bosoms burn ‘For the sweet moment of our blest return!’ The king, who wept, yet knew his tears were vain, Took the seven keys, and kiss'd the parting train. A glittering car, which bounding coursers drew, They mounted strait, and through the forest flew. The youth, unknowing how to pass the day, Review'd the bowers, and heard the fountains play; By hands unseen whate'er he wish'd was brought; And pleasures rose obedient to his thought. Yet all the sweets, that ravish'd him before, Were tedious, now, and charm'd his soul no more: Less lovely still, and still less gay they grew; He sigh'd, he wish'd, and long'd for something new: Back to the hall he turn'd his weary feet, And sat repining on his royal seat. Now, on the seventh bright gate he casts his eyes; And in his bosom rose a bold surmise; ‘The nymph,’ said he, ‘was sure dispos'd to jest, ‘Who talk'd of dungeons in a place so blest: ‘What harm to open, if it be a cell ‘Where deathful spirits and magicians dwell? ‘If dark or foul, I need not pass the door; ‘If new or strange,—my soul desires no more.’ He said, and rose; then took the golden keys, And op'd the door: the hinges mov'd with ease. Before his eyes, appear'd a sullen gloom, Thick, hideous, wild; a cavern, or a tomb. Yet, as he longer gaz'd, he saw afar A light that sparkled like a shooting star. He paus'd:—at last, by some kind angel led, He enter'd; and advanc'd, with cautious tread. Still, as he walk'd, the light appear'd more clear; Hope sooth'd him, then, and scarcely left a fear. At length an aged sire surprised he saw, Who fill'd his bosom with a sacred awe Religion.: A book he held, which, as reclin'd he lay, He read, assisted by a taper's ray; His beard, more white than snow on winter's breast, Hung to the zone that bound his sable vest; A pleasing calmness on his brow was seen, Mild was his look, majestic was his mien. Soon as the youth approach'd the reverend sage, He raised his head, and clos'd the serious page; Then spoke: ‘O son! what chance has turn'd thy feet ‘To this dull solitude, and lone retreat?’ To whom the youth: ‘First, holy father! tell, ‘What force detains thee in this gloomy cell? ‘This isle, this palace, and those balmy bowers, ‘Where six sweet fountains fall on living flowers, ‘Are mine; a train of damsels chose me king, ‘And through my kingdom smiles perpetual spring. ‘For some important cause, to me unknown, ‘This day they left me joyless and alone; ‘But, ere three morns with roses strow the skies, ‘My lovely brides will charm my longing eyes.’ ‘Youth,’ said the sire, ‘on this auspicious day ‘Some angel hither led thy erring way: ‘Hear a strange tale, and tremble at the snare, ‘Which for thy steps thy pleasing foes prepare. ‘Know, in this isle prevails a bloody law; ‘List, stripling, list! (the youth stood fix'd with awe:) ‘ The life of man.But seventy days the hapless monarchs reign, ‘Then close their lives in exile and in pain; ‘Doom'd in a deep and frightful cave to rove, ‘Where darkness hovers o'er the iron grove. ‘Yet know, thy prudence and thy timely care ‘May save thee, son! from this destructive snare. ‘ Heaven.Not far from this, a lovelier island lies, ‘Too rich, too splendid, for unhallow'd eyes: ‘On that blest shore, a sweeter fountain flows ‘Than this vain clime, or this gay palace knows, ‘Which if thou taste, whate'er was sweet before ‘Will bitter seem, and steal thy soul no more. ‘But ere these happy waters thou canst reach, ‘Thy weary steps must pass yon rugged beach, ‘ Death.Where the dark sea with angry billows raves, ‘And, fraught with monsters, curls his howling waves, ‘If to my words, obedient, thou attend, ‘Behold in me thy pilot and thy friend: ‘A bark I keep, supplied with plenteous store, ‘That now lies anchor'd on the rocky shore; ‘And, when of all thy regal toys bereft, ‘In the rude cave an exile thou art left, ‘Myself will find thee on the gloomy lea, ‘And waft thee safely o'er the dangerous sea.’ The boy was fill'd with wonder as he spake, And from a dream of folly seem'd to wake: All day the sage his tainted thoughts refin'd; His reason brighten'd and reform'd his mind: Through the dim cavern hand in hand they walk'd, And much of truth, and much of heaven, they talk'd. At night the stripling to the hall return'd; With other fires his alter'd bosom burn'd. O! to his wiser soul how low, how mean, Seem'd all he e'er had heard, had felt, had seen! He view'd the stars; he view'd the crystal skies; And bless'd the Power All-good, All-great, All-wise. How lowly now appear'd the purple robe, The rubied sceptre, and the ivory globe! How dim the rays that gild the brittle earth! How vile the brood of Folly, and of Mirth! When the third morning, clad in mantle grey, Brought in her rosy car her seventieth day, A band of slaves, who rush'd with furious sound, In chains of steel the willing captive bound; From his young head the diadem they tore, And cast his pearly bracelets on the floor; They rent his robe that bore the rose's hue, And o'er his breast a hairy mantle threw; Then dragg'd him to the damp and dreary cave, Drench'd by the gloomy sea's resounding wave. Meanwhile, the voices of a numerous crowd Pierc'd the dun air, as thunder breaks a cloud: The nymphs another hapless youth had found, And then were leading o'er the guilty ground: They hail'd him king, (alas! how short his reign!) And with fresh chaplets strow'd the fatal plain. The happy exile, monarch now no more, Was roving slowly o'er the lonely shore; At last the sire's expected voice he knew, And tow'rd the sound with hasty rapture flew. The promis'd pinnace just afloat he found, And the glad sage his fetter'd hands unbound; But when he saw the foaming billows rave, And dragons rolling o'er the fiery wave, He stopp'd: his guardian caught his lingering hand, And gently led him o'er the rocky strand; Soon as he touch'd the bark, the ocean smil'd, The dragons vanish'd, and the waves were mild. For many an hour with vigorous arms they row'd, While not a star one friendly sparkle show'd; At length a glimmering brightness they behold, Like a thin cloud which morning dyes with gold: To that they steer: and now, rejoic'd, they view A shore begirt with cliffs of radiant hue. They land: a train, in shining mantles clad, Hail their approach, and bid the youth be glad; They led him o'er the lea with easy pace, And floated, as they went, with heavenly grace. A golden fountain soon appear'd in sight, That o'er the border cast a sunny light. The sage, impatient, scoop'd the lucid wave In a rich vase, which to the youth he gave: He drank; and straight a bright celestial beam Before his eyes display'd a dazzling gleam; Myriads of airy shapes around him gaz'd; Some prais'd his wisdom, some his courage prais'd; Then o'er his limbs a starry robe they spread, And plac'd a crown of diamonds on his head. His aged guide was gone, and in his place Stood a fair cherub flush'd with rosy grace; Who, smiling, spake: ‘Here ever wilt thou rest, ‘Admir'd, belov'd, our brother and our guest; ‘So all shall end, whom vice can charm no more ‘With the gay follies of that perilous shore. ‘See yon immortal towers their gates unfold, ‘With rubies flaming, and no earthly gold! ‘There joys, before unknown, thy steps invite: ‘Bliss without care, and morn without a night. ‘But now farewel! my duty calls me hence; ‘Some injur'd mortal asks my just defence. ‘To yon pernicious island I repair, ‘Swift as a star.’ He speaks, and melts in air. The youth o'er walks of jasper takes his flight; And bounds and blazes in eternal light. SOLIMA, AN ARABIAN ECLOGUE: WRITTEN IN 1768. Ye maids of Aden! hear a loftier tale Than e'er was sung in meadow, bow'r, or dale. —The smiles of Abelah, and Maia's eyes, Where beauty plays, and love in slumber lies; The fragrant hyacinths of Azza's hair, That wanton with the laughing summer air; Love-tinctur'd cheeks, whence roses seek their bloom, And lips, from which the Zephyr steals perfume; Invite no more the wild unpolish'd lay, But fly like dreams before the morning ray. Then farewel, love! and farewel, youthful fires! A nobler warmth my kindled breast inspires. Far bolder notes the list'ning wood shall fill: Flow smooth, ye rivulets; and, ye gales, be still. See yon fair groves that o'er Amana rise, And with their spicy breath embalm the skies; Where every breeze sheds incense o'er the vales, And every shrub the scent of musk exhales! See through yon opening glade a glittering scene, Lawns ever gay, and meadows ever green! Then ask the groves, and ask the vocal bow'rs, Who deck'd their spiry tops with blooming flow'rs, Taught the blue stream o'er sandy vales to flow, And the brown wild with liveliest hues to glow? It was not easy in this part of the translation to avoid a turn similar to that of Pope in the known description of the Man of Ross.Fair Solima! the hills and dales will sing; Fair Solima! the distant echoes ring. But not with idle shows of vain delight, To charm the soul, or to beguile the sight; At noon on banks of pleasure to repose, Where bloom entwin'd the lily, pink, and rose; Not in proud piles to heap the nightly feast, Till morn with pearls has deck'd the glowing east;— Ah! not for this she taught those bowers to rise, And bade all Eden spring before our eyes: Far other thoughts her heavenly mind employ, (Hence, empty pride! and hence, delusive joy!) To cheer with sweet repast the fainting guest; To lull the weary on the couch of rest; To warm the traveller numb'd with winter's cold; The young to cherish, to support the old; The sad to comfort, and the weak protect; The poor to shelter, and the lost direct:— These are her cares, and this her glorious task; Can heaven a nobler give, or mortals ask? Come to these groves, and these life-breathing glades, Ye friendless orphans, and ye dowerless maids! With eager haste your mournful mansions leave, Ye weak, that tremble; and, ye sick, that grieve; Here shall soft tents, o'er flowery lawns display'd, At night defend you, and at noon o'ershade; Here rosy health the sweets of life will shower, And new delights beguile each varied hour. Mourns there a widow, bath'd in streaming tears? Stoops there a sire beneath the weight of years? Weeps there a maid, in pining sadness left, Of tender parents, and of hope, bereft? To Solima their sorrows they bewail; To Solima they pour their plaintive tale. She hears; and, radiant as the star of day, Through the thick forest gains her easy way: She asks what cares the joyless train oppress, What sickness wastes them, or what wants distress; And, as they mourn, she steals a tender sigh, Whilst all her soul sits melting in her eye: Then with a smile the healing balm bestows, And sheds a tear of pity o'er their woes, Which, as it drops, some soft-eyed angel bears Transform'd to pearl, and in his bosom wears. When, chill'd with fear, the trembling pilgrim roves Through pathless deserts, and through tangled groves, Where mantling darkness spreads her dragon wing, And birds of death their fatal dirges sing, While vapours pale a dreadful glimmering cast, And thrilling horror howls in every blast; She cheers his gloom with streams of bursting light, By day a sun, a beaming moon by night; Darts through the quivering shades her heavenly ray, And spreads with rising flowers his solitary way. Ye heavens, for this in showers of sweetness shed Your mildest influence o'er her favor'd head! Long may her name, which distant climes shall praise, Live in our notes, and blossom in our lays! And, like an odorous plant, whose blushing flow'r Paints every dale, and sweetens every bow'r, Borne to the skies in clouds of soft perfume, For ever flourish, and for ever bloom! These grateful songs, ye maids and youths, renew, While fresh-blown violets drink the pearly dew; O'er Azib's banks while love-lorn damsels rove, And gales of fragrance breathe from Hagar's grove. So sung the youth, whose sweetly-warbled strains Fair Mena heard, and Saba's spicy plains. Sooth'd with his lay, the ravish'd air was calm, The winds scarce whisper'd o'er the waving palm; The camels bounded o'er the flowery lawn, Like the swift ostrich, or the sportful fawn; Their silken bands the listening rose-buds rent, And twin'd their blossoms round his vocal tent: He sung, till on the bank the moonlight slept, And closing flowers beneath the night-dew wept; Then ceas'd, and slumber'd in the lap of rest Till the shrill lark had left his low-built nest. Now hastes the swain to tune his rapturous tales In other meadows, and in other vales. LAURA, AN ELEGY FROM PETRARCH. In this fair season, when the whispering gales Drop show'rs of fragrance o'er the bloomy vales,— From bow'r to bow'r the vernal warblers play; The skies are cloudless, and the meads are gay; The nightingale in many a melting strain Sings to the groves, ‘Here Mirth and Beauty reign.’ But me, for ever bath'd in gushing tears, No mirth enlivens, and no beauty cheers: The birds that warble, and the flowers that bloom, Relieve no more this solitary gloom. I see where late the verdant meadow smil'd, A joyless desert, and a dreary wild:— For those dear eyes, that pierc'd my heart before, Are clos'd in death, and charm the world no more: Lost are those tresses, that outshone the morn, And pale those cheeks, that might the skies adorn. Ah, death! thy hand has cropp'd the fairest flower, That shed its smiling rays in beauty's bower; Thy dart has lay'd on yonder sable bier All my soul lov'd, and all the world held dear; Celestial sweetness, love-inspiring youth, Soft-ey'd benevolence, and white-rob'd truth. Hard fate of man, on whom the heaven's bestow A drop of pleasure for a sea of woe! Ah, life of care, in fears or hopes consum'd, Vain hopes, that wither ere they well have bloom'd! How oft, emerging from the shades of night, Laughs the gay morn, and spreads a purple light: But soon the gathering clouds o'ershade the skies, Red lightnings play, and thundering storms arise! How oft a day, that fair and mild appears, Grows dark with fate, and mars the toil of years! Not far remov'd, yet hid from distant eyes, Low in her secret grot, a Naiad lies. Steep arching rocks, with verdant moss o'ergrown, Form her rude diadem, and native throne: There, in a gloomy cave her waters sleep, Clear as a brook, but as an ocean deep. Yet, when the waking flowers of April blow, And warmer sun-beams melt the gather'd snow; Rich with the tribute of the vernal rains, The nymph, exulting, bursts her silver chains; Her living waves in sparkling columns rise, And shine like rainbows to the sunny skies; From cliff to cliff the falling waters roar; Then die in murmurs, and are heard no more. Hence, softly flowing in a dimpled stream, The crystal Sorga spreads a lively gleam;— From which a thousand rills in mazes glide, And deck the banks with summer's gayest pride; Brighten the verdure of the smiling plains; And crown the labor of the joyful swains. First, on these banks, (ah, dream of short delight!) The charms of Laura struck my dazzled sight; Charms, that the bliss of Eden might restore, That heaven might envy, and mankind adore. I saw—and O! what heart could long rebel? I saw, I lov'd, and bade the world farewel. Where'er she mov'd, the meads were fresh and gay, And every bower exhal'd the sweets of May; Smooth flow'd the streams, and softly blew the gale; The rising flowers impurpled every dale; Calm was the Ocean, and the sky serene; An universal smile o'erspread the shining scene: But when in death's cold arms entranc'd she lay, ( Laura was first seen by Petrarch on the sixth of April in the year 1327; and she died on the same day in 1348.Ah, ever dear, yet ever fatal day!) O'er all the air a direful gloom was spread; Pale were the meads, and all their blossoms dead; The clouds of April shed a baleful dew; All nature wore a veil of deadly hue. Go, plaintive breeze! to Laura's flowery bier, Heave the warm sigh, and shed the tender tear. There to the awful shade due homage pay, And softly thus address the sacred clay: ‘Say, envied earth! that dost those charms infold, ‘Where are those cheeks, and where those locks of gold? ‘Where are those eyes, which oft the Muse has sung? ‘Where those sweet lips, and that enchanting tongue? ‘Ye radiant tresses! and thou nectar'd smile! ‘Ye looks that might the melting skies beguile! ‘You robb'd my soul of rest, my eyes of sleep; ‘You taught me how to love, and how to weep.’ No shrub o'erhangs the dew-bespangled vale, No blossom trembles to the dying gale, No floweret blushes in the morning rays, No stream along the winding valley plays, But knows what anguish thrills my tortur'd breast, What pains consume me, and what cares infest. At blush of dawn, and in the gloom of night, Her pale-eyed phantom swims before my sight, Sits on the border of each purling rill, Crowns every bower, and glides o'er every hill. Flows the loud rivulet down the mountain's brow? Or pants the Zephyr on the waving bough? Or sips the labouring bee her balmy dews, And with soft strains her fragrant toil pursues? Or warbles from yon silver-blossom'd thorn The wakeful bird, that hails the rising morn? —My Laura's voice, in many a soothing note, Floats through the yielding air, or seems to float: ‘Why fill thy sighs,’ she says, ‘this lonely bower? ‘Why down thy bosom flows this endless shower? ‘Complain no more: but hope ere long to meet ‘Thy much-lov'd Laura in a happier seat. ‘Here, fairer scenes detain my parted shade; ‘Suns that ne'er set, and flowers that never fade: ‘Through crystal skies I wing my joyous flight, ‘And revel in eternal blaze of light; ‘See all thy wanderings in that vale of tears, ‘And smile at all thy hopes, at all thy fears: ‘Death wak'd my soul, that slept in life before, ‘And op'd these brighten'd eyes, to sleep no more.’ She ends: the Fates, that will no more reveal, Fix on her closing lips their sacred seal. ‘Return, sweet shade!’ I wake, and fondly say, ‘O, cheer my gloom with one far-beaming ray! ‘Return: thy charms my sorrow will dispel, ‘And snatch my spirit from her mortal cell; ‘Then, mix'd with thine, exulting she shall fly, ‘And bound enraptur'd through her native sky.’ She comes no more: my pangs more fierce return; Tears gush in streams, and sighs my bosom burn. Ye banks, that oft my weary limbs have borne, Ye murmuring brooks, that learnt of me to mourn; Ye birds, that tune with me your plaintive lay; Ye groves, where Love once taught my steps to stray; You, ever sweet and ever fair, renew Your strains melodious, and your blooming hue: But not in my sad heart can bliss remain, My heart, the haunt of never-ceasing pain! Henceforth,—to sing in smoothly-warbled lays The smiles of youth, and beauty's heavenly rays; To see the morn her early charms unfold, Her cheeks of roses, and her curls of gold; Led by the sacred Muse, at noon to rove O'er tufted mountain, vale, or shady grove; To watch the stars, that gild the lucid pole, And view yon orbs in mazy order roll; To hear the tender nightingale complain, And warble to the woods her amorous strain:— No more shall these my pensive soul delight, But each gay vision melts in endless night. Nymphs! who in glimmering glades by moonlight dance, And ye, who through the liquid crystal glance, Who oft have heard my sadly-pleasing moan; Behold me now a lifeless marble grown. Ah! lead me to the tomb where Laura lies; Clouds! fold me round; and, gather'd darkness! rise! Bear me, ye gales! in death's soft slumber lay'd; And, ye bright realms, receive my fleeting shade. WRITTEN FOR A FETE CHAMPETRE IN WALES. Fair Tivy, how sweet are thy waves gently flowing, Thy wild oaken woods, and green eglantine bow'rs, Thy banks with the blush-rose and amaranth glowing, While friendship and mirth claim these labourless hours! Yet weak is our vaunt, while something we want, More sweet than the pleasure which prospects can give; Come, smile, damsels of Cardigan, Love can alone make it blissful to live. How sweet is the odour of jasmine and roses, That Zephyr around us so lavishly flings! Perhaps for Bleanpant The seat of W. Brigstocke, Esq. fresh perfume he composes, Or tidings from Bronwith The seat of Thos. Lloyd, Esq. auspiciously brings; Yet weak is our vaunt, while something we want, More sweet than the pleasure which odours can give: Come, smile, damsels of Cardigan, Love can alone make it blissful to live. How sweet was the strain that enliven'd the spirit, And cheer'd us with numbers so frolic and free; The poet is absent: be just to his merit; Ah! may he in love be more happy than we; For weak is our vaunt, while something we want, More sweet than the pleasure the muses can give: Come, smile, damsels of Cardigan, Love can alone make it blissful to live. How gay is the circle of friends round a table, Where stately Kilgarran A ruin of a castle on the banks of the Tivy. o'erhangs the brown dale; Where none are unwilling, and few are unable, To sing a wild song, or repeat a wild tale! Yet weak is our vaunt, while something we want, More sweet than the pleasure that friendship can give: Come, smile, damsels of Cardigan, Love can alone make it blissful to live. No longer then pore over dark Gothic pages, To cull a rude gibberish from Neatheam or Brooke; Leave year-books and parchments to grey-bearded sages; Be nature and love, and fair woman, our book: For weak is our vaunt, while something we want, More sweet than the pleasure that learning can give: Come, smile, damsels of Cardigan, Love can alone make it blissful to live. Admit that our labours were crown'd with full measure, And gold were the fruit of rhetorical flow'rs, That India supplied us with long-hoarded treasure, That Dinevor Seat of Lord Dinevor, near Landelo, in Carmarthen., Slebeck Seat of ? Philips, Esq. near Haverford West., and Coidsmore Seat of Thomas Lloyd, Esq. near Cardigan. were ours; Yet weak is our vaunt, while something we want, More sweet than the pleasure that riches can give: Come, smile, damsels of Cardigan, Love can alone make it blissful to live. Or say, that, preferring fair Thames to fair Tivy, We gain'd the bright ermine robes, purple and red; And peep'd thro' long perukes, like owlets thro' ivy, Or say, that bright coronets blaz'd on our head; Yet weak is our vaunt, while something we want, More sweet than the pleasure that honours can give: Come, smile, damsels of Cardigan, Love can alone make it blissful to live. ON SEEING MISS ? RIDE BY HIM, WITHOUT KNOWING HER. Written in 1780. Cardigan, Aug. 4, 1780. So lightly glanc'd she o'er the lawn, So lightly through the vale, That not more swiftly bounds the fawn, In Sidon's palmy dale. Full well her bright-hair'd courser knew, How sweet a charge he bore, And proudly shook the tassels blue, That on his neck he wore. Her vest, with liveliest tincture glow'd, That Summer-blossoms wear, And wanton down her shoulders flow'd, Her hyacinthine hair. Zephyr in play had loos'd the string, And with it laughing flown, Diffusing from his dewy wing, A fragrance not his own. Her shape was like the slender pine, With vernal buds array'd, O, heav'n! what rapture would be mine, To slumber in its shade. Her cheeks—one rose had Strephon seen, But dazzled with the sight, At distance view'd her nymph-like mien, And fainted with delight. He thought Diana from the chase, Was hastening to her bow'r; For more than mortal seem'd a face, Of such resistless pow'r. Actæon's fatal change he fear'd, And trembled at the breeze; High antlers had his fancy rear'd, And quiv'ring sunk his knees. He well might err—that morn confess'd, The queen with silver beam, Shone forth, and Sylvia thus address'd, By Tivy's azure stream: ‘Let us this day our robes exchange; ‘Bind on my waxing moon; ‘Then through yon woods at pleasure range, ‘And shun the sultry noon. ‘Whilst I at Cardigan prepare ‘Gay stores of silk and lace, ‘Like thine, will seem my flowing hair, ‘Like thine, my heav'nly grace. ‘My brother Phœbus lost his heart ‘When first he view'd thy charms, ‘And would this day, with dang'rous art, ‘Allure thee to his arms. ‘But Cynthia, friend to virgins fair, ‘Thy steps will ever guide, ‘Protect thee from th'enchanting snare, ‘And o'er thy heart preside. ‘In vain his wiles he shall essay, ‘And touch his golden lyre; ‘Then to the skies shall wing his way, ‘With pale, yet raging fire. ‘Should he with lies traduce the fair, ‘And boast how oft he kiss'd her, ‘The gods shall laugh while I declare, ‘He flirted with his sister.’ TO LADY JONES: FROM THE ARABIC. Written in 1783. While sad suspense and chill delay Bereave my wounded soul of rest, New hopes, new fears, from day to day, By turns assail my lab'ring breast. My heart, which ardent love consumes, Throbs with each agonizing thought; So flutters with entangled plumes, The lark in wily meshes caught. There she, with unavailing strain, Pours thro' the night her warbled grief: The gloom retires, but not her pain; The dawn appears, but not relief. Two younglings wait the parent bird, Their thrilling sorrows to appease: She comes—ah! no: the sound they heard Was but a whisper of the breeze. FROM THE PERSIAN POEM OF HATIFI, IN THE MEASURE OF THE ORIGINAL. With cheeks where eternal paradise bloom'd, Sweet Laili the soul of Kais had consum'd. Transported her heavenly graces he view'd: Of slumber no more he thought, nor of food. Love rais'd in their glowing bosoms his throne, Adopting the chosen pair as his own. Together on flowery seats they repos'd: Their lips not one idle moment were clos'd. To mortals they gave no hint of their smart: Love only the secret drew from each heart. TRANSPOSITION The reader will perceive in this transposition that the stations of the words are only changed, by which simple means the five couplets are transposed to Iambic measure.. With cheeks where paradise eternal bloom'd, Sweet Laili had the soul of Kais consum'd. Her heav'nly graces he transported view'd: No more he thought of slumber, nor of food. Love in their glowing bosoms rais'd his throne, The chosen pair adopting as his own. On flowery seats together they repos'd: Their lips one idle moment were not clos'd. No hint they gave to mortals of their smart: Love only drew the secret from each heart. EXTEMPORE OPINION ON NATIVE TALENT, IN ANSWER TO LINES FROM A FRIEND. Ah! but too well, dear friend, I know My fancy weak, my reason slow, My memory by art improv'd, My mind by baseless trifles mov'd. Give me (thus high my pride I raise) The ploughman's or the gard'ner's praise, With patient and unceasing toil, To meliorate a stubborn soil. And say, (no higher meed I ask,) ‘With zeal hast thou perform'd thy task;’ Praise, of which virtuous minds may boast, They best confer, who merit most. WRITTEN AFTER A PERUSAL OF THE EIGHTH SERMON OF BARROW, 1786. As meadows parch'd, brown groves, and withering flow'rs, Imbibe the sparkling dew and genial show'rs; As chill dark air inhales the morning beam, As thirsty harts enjoy the gelid stream; Thus to man's grateful soul from heav'n descend, The mercies of his Father, Lord, and Friend. THE CONCLUDING SENTENCE OF BERKLEY'S SIRIS, IMITATED. Before thy mystic altar, heav'nly Truth, I kneel in manhood, as I knelt in youth: Thus let me kneel, till this dull form decay, And life's last shade be brighten'd by thy ray: Then shall my soul, now lost in clouds below, Soar without bound, without consuming glow These lines were written by Sir William Jones in Berkley's Siris; they are, in fact, a beautiful version of the last sentence of the Siris, amplified and adapted to himself; ‘He that would make a real progress in knowledge, must dedicate his age as well as youth, the latter growth as well as the first fruits, at the altar of Truth.’. AN EPODE FROM A CHORUS IN THE UNFINISHED TRAGEDY OF SOHRAB. What pow'r, beyond all pow'rs elate, Sustains this universal frame? 'Tis not nature, 'tis not fate, 'Tis not the dance of atoms blind, Ethereal space, or subtile flame; No; 'tis one vast eternal mind, Too sacred for an earthly name. He forms, pervades, directs the whole; Not like the macrocosm's imag'd soul, But provident of endless good, By ways nor seen nor understood, Which e'en His angels vainly might explore. High, their highest thoughts above, Truth, wisdom, justice, mercy, love, Wrought in His heav'nly essence, blaze and soar. Mortals, who His glory seek, Rapt in contemplation meek, Him fear, Him trust, Him venerate, Him adore. END OF THE FIRST VOLUME.</field>

HIS were the stores of letter'd Time,—compress'd, The mind of ages in a single breast; The glance to catch, the patience to inquire, The sage's temper, and the poet's fire. WRANGHAM. Accomplish'd JONES! whose hand to ev'ry art Could unknown charms and nameless grace impart; —The song to Virtue as the Muses dear; Tho' glowing, chaste; and lovely, though severe. What gorgeous trophies crown his youthful bloom, The spoils august of Athens and of Rome! And, lo! untouch'd by British brows before, Yet nobler trophies wait on Asia's shore; There at his magic voice, what wonders rise! Th'astonish'd East unfolds her mysteries; Round her dark shrines, a sudden blaze he showers, And, all unveil'd, the proud Pantheon towers. GRANT. ODES. AN ODE OF PETRARCH, TO THE FOUNTAIN OF VALCHIUSA. Ye clear and sparkling streams! (Warm'd by the sunny beams,) Through whose transparent crystal Laura play'd; Ye boughs, that deck the grove, Where Spring her chaplets wove, While Laura lay beneath the quivering shade M. de Voltaire has given us a beautiful paraphrase of this first stanza, though it is certain that he had never read the ode in the original, or at most only the three first lines of it; for he asserts, that the Italian song is irregular; and without rhymes; whereas the stanzas are perfectly regular, and the rhymes very exact. His design was to give Madame du Chatelet, for whom he wrote his history, an idea of Petrarch's style but, if she had only read his imitation, she could have but an imperfect notion of the Italian, which the reader will easily perceive by comparing them.; Sweet herbs! and blushing flowers! That crown yon vernal bowers, For ever fatal, yet for ever dear; And ye, that heard my sighs When first she charm'd my eyes, Soft-breathing gales! my dying accents hear. If heaven has fix'd my doom, That Love must quite consume My bursting heart, and close my eyes in death; Ah! grant this slight request,— That, here, my urn may rest, When to its mansion flies my vital breath. This pleasing hope will smooth My anxious mind, and sooth The pangs of that inevitable hour; My spirit will not grieve Her mortal veil to leave In these calm shades, and this enchanting bow'r. Haply the guilty maid Through yon accustom'd glade To my sad tomb will take her lonely way; Where first her beauty's light O'erpower'd my dazzled sight, When Love on this fair border bade me stray: There, sorrowing, shall she see, Beneath an aged tree, Her true, but hapless, lover's lowly bier; Too late, her tender sighs Shall melt the pitying skies, And her soft veil shall hide the gushing tear. O! well-remember'd day, When on yon bank she lay Meek in her pride, and in her rigor mild; The young and blooming flowers, Falling in fragrant showers, Shone on her neck, and on her bosom smil'd: Some on her mantle hung, Some in her locks were strung, Like orient gems in rings of flaming gold; Some, in a spicy cloud Descending, call'd aloud, ‘Here Love and Youth the reins of empire hold.’ I view'd the heavenly maid; And, rapt in wonder, said, ‘The groves of Eden gave this angel birth:’ Her look, her voice, her smile, That might all heaven beguile, Wafted my soul above the realms of earth: The star-bespangled skies Were open'd to my eyes; Sighing I said, ‘Whence rose this glittering scene?’ Since that auspicious hour, This bank, and odorous bower, My morning couch, and evening haunt, have been. Well mayst thou blush, my song, To leave the rural throng, And fly thus artless to my Laura's ear; But, were thy poet's fire Ardent as his desire, Thou wert a song that heaven might stoop to hear. AN ODE OF JAMI, IN THE PERSIAN FORM AND MEASURE. How sweet the gale of morning breathes! Sweet news of my delight he brings; News, that the rose will soon approach the tuneful bird of night, he brings. Soon will a thousand parted souls be led, his captives, through the sky, Since tidings, which in every heart must ardent flames excite, he brings. Late near my charmer's flowing robe he pass'd, and kiss'd the fragrant hem; Thence, odour to the rose-bud's veil, and jasmine's mantle white he brings. Painful is absence, and that pain to some base rival oft is ow'd; Thou know'st, dear maid! when to thine ear false tales, contriv'd in spite, he brings. Why should I trace loves mazy path, since destiny my bliss forbids? Black destiny! my lot is woe, to me no ray of light he brings. In vain, a friend his mind disturbs, in vain a childish trouble gives, When sage physician to the couch, of heartsick love-lorn wight, he brings. A roving stranger in thy town no guidance can sad Jami find, Till this his name, and rambling lay to thine all-piercing sight he brings. THE MUSE RECALLED; AN ODE ON THE NUPTIALS OF LORD VISCOUNT ALTHORP, AND MISS LAVINIA BINGHAM, ELDEST DAUGHTER OF CHARLES, LORD LUCAN, MARCH 6, 1781. Return, celestial Muse! By whose bright fingers o'er my infant head, Lull'd with immortal symphony, were spread Fresh bays and flow'rets of a thousand hues; Return! thy golden lyre, Chorded with sunny rays of temper'd fire, Which in Astræa's fane I fondly hung, Bold I reclaim: but ah! sweet maid, Bereft of thy propitious aid, My voice is tuneless, and my harp unstrung. In vain I call—What charm, what potent spell Shall kindle into life the long unwaken'd shell? Haste! the well-wrought Miss Louisa Bingham, and Miss Frances Molesworth, her cousin, decked a basket with ribands and flowers to hold the nuptial presents. basket bring, Which two sister Graces wove, When the third, whose praise I sing, Blushing sought the bridal grove, Where the slow-descending sun Gilt the bow'rs of Wimbledon. In the vase mysterious fling Pinks and roses gemm'd with dew, Flow'rs of ev'ry varied hue, Daughters fair of early spring, Laughing sweet with sapphire eyes, Or with Iris' mingled dyes: Then around the basket go, Tripping light with silent pace, While, with solemn voice and slow, Thrice pronouncing thrice I trace On the silken texture bright, Character'd in beamy light, Names of more than mortal pow'r, Sweetest influence to diffuse; Names, that from her shadiest bow'r Draw the soft reluctant Muse. First, I with living gems enchase The name of her, whom for this festive day With Zone and Mantle elegantly gay The Graces have adorn'd, herself a Grace, Molesworth—hark! a swelling note Seems on Zephyr's wing to float, Or has vain hope my flatter'd sense beguil'd? Next her who braided many a flow'r To deck her sister's nuptial bow'r, Bingham, with gentle heart and aspect mild: The charm prevails—I hear, I hear Strains nearer yet, and yet more near. Still ye nymphs and youths advance, Sprinkle still the balmy show'r, Mingle still the mazy dance, Two names of unresisted pow'r, Behold, in radiant characters I write: O rise! O leave thy secret shrine, For they, who all thy nymphal train outshine, Duncannon Lady Henrietta Spencer, second daughter of John Earl Spencer, and wife of the Lord Viscount Duncannon, eldest son of the Earl of Besborough., heavenly muse, and Devonshire Lady Georgiana, eldest daughter of Earl Spencer, and wife of William Cavendish, fifth Duke of Devonshire. invite. Saw ye not yon myrtle wave? Heard ye not a warbled strain? Yes! the harp which Clio gave, Shall his ancient sound regain. One dearer name remains. Prepare, prepare! She comes—how swift th'impatient air Drinks the rising accent sweet! Soon the charm shall be complete. Return and wake the silent string; Return, sweet Muse, for Althorp bids me sing. 'Tis she—and, as she smiles, the breathing lyre Leaps from his silken bands, and darts ethereal fire. Bright son of ev'ning, lucid star, Auspicious rise thy soften'd beam, Admir'd ere Cynthia's pearly car O'er heav'n's pure azure spreads her gleam: Thou saw'st the blooming pair, Like thee serenely fair, By love united and the nuptial vow, Thou see'st the mirthful train Dance to th'unlabor'd strain, See'st bound with myrtle ev'ry youthful brow. Shine forth, ye silver eyes of night, And gaze on virtues crown'd with treasures of delight. And thou, the golden-tressed child of morn, Whene'er thy all-inspiring heat Bids bursting rose-buds hill and mead adorn, See them with every gift that Jove bestows, With ev'ry joy replete, Save, when they melt at sight of human woes. Flow smoothly, circling hours, And o'er their heads unblended pleasure pour; Nor let your fleeting round Their mortal transports bound, But fill their cup of bliss, eternal pow'rs, Till Time himself shall cease, and suns shall blaze no more. Each morn, reclin'd on many a rose, Lavinia's Lady Althorp has an extraordinary talent for drawing historic subjects, and expressing the passions in the most simple manner. pencil shall disclose New forms of dignity and grace, Th'expressive air, th'impassion'd face, The curled smile, the bubbling tear, The bloom of hope, the snow of fear, To some poetic tale fresh beauty give, And bid the starting tablet rise and live; Or with swift fingers shall she touch the strings. And in the magic loom of harmony Notes of such wondrous texture weave, As lift the soul on seraph wings, Which, as they soar above the jasper sky, Below them suns unknown and worlds unnumber'd leave. While thou by list'ning crowds approv'd, Lov'd by the Muse and by the poet lov'd, Althorp, shouldst emulate the fame Of Roman Patriots and th'Athenian name; Shouldst charm with full persuasive eloquence, With all thy Georgiana Poyntz, Countess Spencer. mother's grace, and all thy father's sense, Th'applauding senate; whilst, above thy head, Exulting Liberty should smile, Then, bidding dragon-born contention cease, Should knit the dance with meek-eyed peace, And by thy voice impell'd should spread An universal joy around her cherish'd isle. But ah! thy public virtues, youth! are vain In this voluptuous, this abandon'd age, When Albion's sons with frantic rage, In crimes alone and recreant baseness bold, Freedom and Concord, with their weeping train, Repudiate; slaves of vice, and slaves of gold! They, on starry pinions sailing Through the crystal fields of air, Mourn their efforts unavailing, Lost persuasions, fruitless care: Truth, Justice, Reason, Valour, with them fly To seek a purer soil, a more congenial sky. Beyond the vast Atlantic deep A dome by viewless Genii shall be raised, The walls of adamant compact and steep, The portals with sky-tinctur'd gems emblaz'd: There on a lofty throne shall virtue stand; To her the youth of Delaware shall kneel; And, when her smiles rain plenty o'er the land, Bow, tyrants, bow beneath th'avenging steel! Commerce with fleets shall mock the waves, And arts, that flourish not with slaves, Dancing with every Grace and ev'ry Muse, Shall bid the vallies laugh and heav'nly beams diffuse. She ceases; and a strange delight Still vibrates on my ravish'd ear: What floods of glory drown my sight! What scenes I view! what sounds I hear! This for my friend—but, gentle nymphs, no more Dare I with spells divine the Muse recall: Then, fatal harp, thy transient rapture o'er, Calm I replace thee on the sacred wall. Ah! see how lifeless hangs the lyre, Not lightning now, but glitt'ring wire! Me to the brawling bar and wrangles high Bright-hair'd Sabrina calls and rosy-bosom'd Wye.

What constitutes a state? Not high rais'd battlement or labor'd mound, Thick wall or moated gate; Not cities proud with spires and turrets crown'd; Not bays and broad-arm'd ports, Where, laughing at the storm, rich navies ride, Not starr'd and spangled courts, Where low-brow'd baseness wafts perfume to pride. NO:—Men, high-minded Men, With pow'rs as far above dull brutes endued, In forest, brake, or den, As beasts excel cold rocks and brambles rude; Men, who their duties know, But know their rights, and knowing, dare maintain, Prevent the long-aim'd blow, And crush the tyrant while they rend the chain: These constitute a state, And sov'reign Law, that state's collected will, O'er thrones and globes elate Sits Empress, crowning good, repressing ill; Smit by her sacred frown The fiend, Discretion, like a vapour sinks, And e'en th'all-dazzling Crown Hides his faint rays, and at her bidding shrinks.

LOWTH De Sacra Poesi, Præl. 1. Verdant myrtle's branchy pride Shall my biting falchion wreathe: Soon shall grace each manly side Tubes that speak, and points that breathe. Thus Harmodius! shone thy blade; Thus Aristogiton! thine: Whose, when Britain sighs for aid, Whose shall now delay to shine? Dearest youths, in islands blest, Not, like recreant idlers, dead, You with fleet Pelides rest, And with godlike Diomed. Verdant myrtle's branchy pride Shall my thirsty blade entwine: Such, Harmodius! deck'd thy side; Such, Aristogiton! thine. They the base Hipparchus slew At the feast of Pallas crown'd: Gods!—how swift their poniards flew! How the monster ting'd the ground! Then in Athens all was peace, Equal laws and liberty: Nurse of arts and age of Greece! People valiant, firm and free! Not less glorious was thy deed, Wentworth! fix'd in virtue's cause; Not less brilliant be thy meed, Lenox! friend to equal laws. High in Freedom's temple rais'd, See Fitz-Maurice beaming stand, For collected virtues prais'd, Wisdom's voice and Valour's hand? Ne'er shall Fate their eyelids close: They, in blooming regions blest, With Harmodius shall repose; With Aristogiton rest. No, blest chiefs! a hero's crown Let th'Athenian patriots claim: You less fiercely won renown; You assum'd a milder name. They through blood for glory strove, You more blissful tidings bring; They to death a Tyrant drove, You to fame restor'd a King. Rise Britannia! dauntless rise! Cheer'd with triple harmony, Monarch good, and Nobles wise, People valiant, firm, and free! THE FIRST NEMEAN ODE This Ode is translated word for word with the original; those epithets and phrases only being necessarily added which are printed in italic letters. See Argument of the Hymns to Pacriti. OF PINDAR. I. 1. Calm breathing-place of Alpheus dead Ortygia, graceful branch of Syracuse renown'd, Young Dina's rosy bed, Sister of Delos, thee, with sweet, yet lofty, sound Bursting numbers call, to raise Of tempest-footed steeds the trophies glorious (Thus Etnean Jove we praise;) While Chromius' car invites, and Nemea's plain For noble acts victorious To weave th'encomiastic strain. 2. From prosp'ring Gods the song begins: Next hails that godlike man and virtue's holy meeds: He the flow'r of greatness wins, Whom smiling fortune crowns; and vast heroic deeds Ev'ry muse delights to sing. Now wake to that fair isle the splendid story, Which the great Olympian king, Jove, gave to Proserpine, and wav'd his locks, Vowing, that, supreme in glory, Fam'd for sweet fruits, and nymph'd-lov'd rocks, 3. Sicilia's full nutritious breast With tow'r'd and wealthy cities he would crown. Her the son of Saturn bless'd With suitors brazen-arm'd for war's renown By lance and fiery steed; yet oft thy leaves, Olympic olive! bind their hair In wreathy gold. Great subjects I prepare; But none th'immortal verse deceives. II. 1. Oft in the portals was I plac'd Of that guest-loving man, and pour'd the dulcet strain, Where becoming dainties grac'd His hospitable hoard: for ne'er with efforts vain Strangers to his mansion came: And thus the virtuous, when detraction rages, Quench with lib'ral streams her flame. Let each in virtue's path right onward press, As each his art engages, And, urg'd by genius, win success. 2. Laborious action strength applies, And wary conduct, Sense: the future to foresee Nature gives to few, the wise. Agesidamus' son, she frankly gave to thee Pow'rful might and wisdom deep. I see not in dark cells the hoarded treasure Grov'ling with low care to keep, But, as wealth flows, to spread it, and to hear Loud fame, with ample measure Cheering my friends, since hope and fear 3. Assail disastrous men. The praise Of Hercules with rapture I embrace: On the heights, which virtues raise, The rapid legend old his name shall place; For, when he brook'd no more the cheerless gloom, And burst into the blaze of day, The child of Jove with his twin-brother lay, Refulgent from the sacred womb. III. 1. Not unobserv'd the godlike boy By Juno golden-thron'd the saffron'd cradle press'd; Straight heav'n's queen with furious joy Bade hideous dragons fleet th'unguarded floor infest: They, the portals op'ning wide, Roll'd through the chamber's broad recess tremendous, And in Jaws fire-darting tried The slumb'ring babe to close. He, starting light, Rear'd his bold head stupendous, And first in battle prov'd his might. 2. With both resistless hands he clasp'd Both struggling horrid pests, and cloth'd their necks with death; They expiring, as he grasp'd, Pour'd from their throats compress'd the foul envenom'd breath. Horror seiz'd the female train, Who near Alcmena's genial couch attended: She, from agonizing pain Yet weak, unsandal'd and unmantled rush'd, And her lov'd charge defended, Whilst he the fiery monsters crush'd. 3. Swift the Cadmean leaders ran In brazen mail precipitately bold: First Amphitryon, dauntless man, Bar'd his rais'd falchion from its sheathing gold, While grinding anguish pierc'd his flutt'ring breast; For private woes most keenly bite Self-loving man; but soon the heart is light, With sorrow not its own oppress'd. IV. 1. Standing in deep amazement wild With rapt'rous pleasure mix'd, he saw th'enormous force, Saw the valour of his child: And fated heralds prompt, as heav'n had shap'd their course, Wafted round the varied tale: Then call'd he from high Jove's contiguous region, Him, whose warnings never fail, Tiresias blind, who told, in diction sage, The chief and thronging legion What fortunes must his boy engage; 2. What lawless tyrants of the wood, What serpents he would slay, what monsters of the main, What proud foe to human good, The worst of monstrous forms, that holy manhood stain, His huge arm to death would dash: How, when heav'n's host, o'er Phlegra's champaign hasting, With embattled giants rash Vindictive warr'd, his pond'rous mace would storm With dreadful strokes wide-wasting, And dust their glitt'ring locks deform, 3. He told; and how in blissful peace Through cycles infinite of gliding time, When his mortal task should cease, Sweet prize of perils hard and toil sublime, In gorgeous mansions he should hold entranc'd Soft Hebe, fresh with blooming grace, And crown, exalting his majestic race, The bridal feast near Jove advanc'd. A CHINESE ODE PARAPHRASED. Behold, where yon blue riv'let glides Along the laughing dale; Light reeds bedeck its verdant sides, And frolic in the gale: So shines our prince! In bright array The virtues round him wait; And sweetly smil'd th'auspicious day, That rais'd him o'er our state. As pliant hands in shapes refin'd Rich iv'ry carve and smooth, His laws thus mould each ductile mind, And ev'ry passion soothe. As gems are taught by patient art In sparkling ranks to beam, With manners thus he forms the heart, And spreads a gen'ral gleam. What soft, yet awful, dignity! What meek, yet manly, grace! What sweetness dances in his eye, And blossoms in his face! So shines our prince! A sky-born crowd Of virtues round him blaze: Ne'er shall oblivion's murky cloud Obscure his deathless praise. THE VERBAL TRANSLATION. ‘Behold yon reach of the river Ki; ‘Its green reeds how luxuriant! how luxuriant! ‘Thus is our prince adorned with virtues; ‘As a carver, as a filer of ivory, ‘As a cutter, as a polisher, of gems. ‘O how elate and sagacious! O how dauntless and composed! ‘How worthy of fame! How worthy of reverence! ‘We have a prince adorned with virtues, ‘Whom to the end of time we cannot forget.’ A TURKISH ODE OF MESIHI. Hear! how the nightingales, on every spray, Hail, in wild notes, the sweet return of May! —The gale that o'er yon waving almond blows, The verdant bank with silver blossoms strows; The smiling season decks each flowery glade. Be gay: too soon the flowers of Spring will fade. What gales of fragrance scent the vernal air! Hills, dales, and woods, their loveliest mantles wear, Who knows what cares await that fatal day, When ruder gusts shall banish gentle May? Ev'n death, perhaps, our vallies will invade. Be gay: too soon the flowers of Spring will fade. The tulip now its varied hue displays, And sheds, like Ahmed's eye, celestial rays. Ah, nation ever faithful, ever true, The joys of youth, while May invites, pursue! Will not these notes your timorous minds persuade? Be gay: too soon the flowers of Spring will fade. The sparkling dewdrops o'er the lilies play, Like orient pearls, or like the beams of day. If love and mirth your wanton thoughts engage, Attend, ye nymphs! a poet's words are sage; While thus you sit beneath the trembling shade, Be gay: too soon the flowers of Spring will fade. The fresh-blown rose like Zeineb's cheek appears, When pearls, like dewdrops, glitter in her ears. The charms of youth at once are seen and past; And nature says, ‘They are too sweet to last.’ So blooms the rose; and so the blushing maid. Be gay: too soon the flowers of Spring will fade. See! yon anemonies their leaves unfold, With rubies flaming and with living gold. —While crystal showers from weeping clouds descend, Enjoy the presence of thy tuneful friend: Now, while the wines are brought, the sofa's lay'd, Be gay: too soon the flowers of Spring will fade. The plants no more are dried, the meadows dead, No more the rose-bud hangs her pensive head: The shrubs revive in valleys, meads, and bowers, And every stalk is diadem'd with flowers; In silken robes each hillock stands array'd. Be gay: too soon the flowers of Spring will fade. Clear drops, each morn, impearl the rose's bloom, And from its leaf the Zephyr drinks perfume; The dewy buds expand their lucid store: Be this our wealth: ye damsels, ask no more. Though wise men envy, and though fools upbraid, Be gay: too soon the flowers of Spring will fade. The dewdrops sprinkled, by the musky gale, Are chang'd to essence ere they reach the dale. The mild blue sky a rich pavilion spreads, Without our labor, o'er our favor'd heads. Let others toil in war, in arts, or trade:— Be gay: too soon the flowers of Spring will fade. Late, gloomy winter chill'd the sullen air, Till Soliman arose, and all was fair. Soft, in his reign, the notes of love resound, And pleasure's rosy cup goes freely round. Here on the bank, which mantling vines o'ershade, Be gay: too soon the flowers of Spring will fade. May this rude lay from age to age remain, A true memorial of this lovely train. Come, charming maid! and hear thy poet sing, Thyself the rose, and He the bird of spring: Love bids him sing, and Love will be obey'd. Be gay: too soon the flowers of Spring will fade. TALES. THE PALACE OF FORTUNE: AN INDIAN TALE. Mild was the vernal gale, and calm the day, When Maia near a crystal fountain lay, Young Maia, fairest of the blue-eyed maids, That rov'd at noon in Tibet's musky shades; But, haply, wandering through the fields of air, Some fiend had whisper'd—Maia, thou art fair! Hence swelling pride had fill'd her simple breast, And rising passions robb'd her mind of rest; In courts and glittering towers she wish'd to dwell, And scorn'd her laboring parent's lowly cell. And now, as gazing o'er the glassy stream, She saw her blooming cheek's reflected beam, Her tresses brighter than the morning sky, And the mild radiance of her sparkling eye, Low sighs and trickling tears by turns she stole, And thus discharg'd the anguish of her soul: ‘Why glow those cheeks, if unadmir'd they glow? ‘Why flow those tresses, if unprais'd they flow? ‘Why dart those eyes their liquid ray serene, ‘Unfelt their influence, and their light unseen? ‘Ye heavens! was that love-breathing bosom made ‘To warm dull groves, and cheer the lonely glade? ‘Ah, no: those blushes, that enchanting face, ‘Some tap'stried hall, or gilded bower, might grace; ‘Might deck the scenes, where love and pleasure reign, ‘And fire with amorous flames the youthful train.’ While thus she spoke, a sudden blaze of light Shot through the clouds, and struck her dazzled sight. She rais'd her head, astonish'd, to the skies, And veil'd with trembling hands her aching eyes; When through the yielding air she saw from far A goddess gliding in a golden car, That soon descended on the flowery lawn, By two fair yokes of starry peacocks drawn: A thousand nymphs with many a sprightly glance Form'd round the radiant wheels an airy dance, Celestial shapes! in fluid light array'd; Like twinkling stars their beamy sandals play'd; Their lucid mantles glitter'd in the sun, (Webs half so bright the silkworm never spun), Transparent robes, that bore the rainbow's hue, And finer than the nets of pearly dew That morning spreads o'er every opening flow'r, When sportive summer decks his bridal bow'r. The queen herself, too fair for mortal sight, Sat in the centre of encircling light. Soon with soft touch she rais'd the trembling maid, And by her side in silent slumber laid: Straight the gay birds display'd their spangled train, And flew refulgent through th'aërial plain; The fairy band their shining pinions spread, And, as they rose, fresh gales of sweetness shed; Fann'd with their flowing skirts, the sky was mild; And heaven's blue fields with brighter radiance smil'd. Now in a garden deck'd with verdant bow'rs The glittering car descends on bending flow'rs: The goddess still with looks divinely fair Surveys the sleeping object of her care; Then o'er her cheek her magic finger lays, Soft as the gale that o'er a violet plays, And thus in sounds, that favor'd mortals hear, She gently whispers in her ravish'd ear: ‘Awake, sweet maid, and view this charming scene ‘For ever beauteous, and for ever green; ‘Here living rills of purest nectar flow ‘O'er meads that with unfading flowerets glow; ‘Here amorous gales their scented wings display, ‘Mov'd by the breath of ever-blooming May; ‘Here in the lap of pleasure shalt thou rest, ‘Our lov'd companion, and our honor'd guest.’ The damsel hears the heav'nly notes distil, Like melting snow, or like a vernal rill. She lifts her head, and, on her arm reclin'd, Drinks the sweet accents in her grateful mind: On all around she turns her roving eyes, And views the splendid scene with glad surprise; Fresh lawns, and sunny banks, and roseate bow'rs, Hills white with flocks, and meadows gemm'd with flow'rs; Cool shades, a sure defence from summer's ray, And silver brooks, (where wanton damsels play,) Which with soft notes their dimpled crystal roll'd O'er color'd shells and sand of native gold; A rising fountain play'd from every stream, Smil'd as it rose, and cast a transient gleam, Then, gently falling in a vocal show'r, Bath'd every shrub, and sprinkled every flow'r, That on the banks, like many a lovely bride, View'd in the liquid glass their blushing pride; Whilst on each branch, with purple blossoms hung, The sportful birds their joyous descant sung. While Maia, thus entranc'd in sweet delight, With each gay object fed her eager sight, The goddess mildly caught her willing hand, And led her trembling o'er the flow'ry land; Soon she beheld where, through an opening glade, A spacious lake its clear expanse display'd; In mazy curls, the flowing jasper wav'd O'er its smooth bed, with polish'd agate pav'd; And on a rock of ice, by magic rais'd, High in the midst a gorgeous palace blaz'd; The sunbeams on the gilded portals glanc'd, Play'd on the spires, and on the turrets danc'd: To four bright gates four ivory bridges led, With pearls illumin'd, and with roses spread: And now, more radiant than the morning sun, Her easy way the gliding goddess won; Still by her hand she held the fearful maid, And, as she pass'd, the fairies homage paid: They enter'd, strait, the sumptuous palace-hall, Where silken tapestry emblaz'd the wall, Refulgent tissue, of an heavenly woof; And gems unnumber'd sparkled on the roof, On whose blue arch the flaming diamonds play'd, As on a sky with living stars inlay'd: Of precious diadems a regal store, With globes and sceptres, strew'd the porphyry floor; Rich vests of eastern kings around were spread, And glittering zones a starry lustre shed: But Maia most admir'd the pearly strings, Gay bracelets, golden chains, and sparkling rings. High, in the centre of the palace, shone, Suspended in mid-air, an opal throne: To this the queen ascends, with royal pride, And sets the favor'd damsel by her side. Around the throne, in mystic order, stand The fairy train, and wait her high command: When thus she speaks: (the maid attentive sips Each word that flows, like nectar, from her lips.) ‘Favorite of heaven, my much lov'd Maia, know, ‘From me all joys, all earthly blessings, flow: ‘Me suppliant men imperial Fortune call, ‘The mighty empress of yon rolling ball:’ (She rais'd her finger, and the wondering maid, At distance hung, the dusky globe survey'd; Saw the round earth with foaming oceans vein'd, And laboring crowds on mountain tops sustain'd.) ‘To me has fate the pleasing task assign'd, ‘To rule the various thoughts of humankind; ‘To catch each rising wish, each ardent prayer, ‘And some to grant, and some to waste in air. ‘Know further,—as I rang'd the crystal sky, ‘I saw thee near the murmuring fountain lie; ‘Mark'd the rough storm that gather'd in thy breast, ‘And knew what care thy joyless soul opprest. ‘Strait I resolv'd to bring thee quick relief, ‘Ease every weight, and soften every grief; ‘If in this court contented thou canst live, ‘And taste the joys these happy gardens give:— ‘But fill thy mind with vain desires no more, ‘And view without a wish yon shining store. ‘Soon shall a numerous train before me bend, ‘And kneeling votaries my shrine attend; ‘Warn'd by their empty vanities beware, ‘And scorn the folly of each human prayer.’ She said; and strait a damsel of her train With tender fingers touch'd a golden chain. Now a soft bell delighted Maia hears, That sweetly trembles on her listening ears; Through the calm air the melting numbers float, And wanton echo lengthens every note. Soon, through the dome, a mingled hum arose, Like the swift stream that o'er a valley flows; Now louder still it grew, and still more loud, As distant thunder breaks the bursting cloud: Through the four portals rush'd a various throng, That like a wintry torrent pour'd along: A crowd, of every tongue and every hue, Toward the bright throne, with eager rapture, flew. A lovely stripling Pleasure. stepp'd before the rest With hasty pace, and tow'rd the goddess prest; His mien was graceful, and his looks were mild, And in his eye celestial sweetness smil'd: Youth's purple glow, and beauty's rosy beam, O'er his smooth cheeks diffus'd a lively gleam; The floating ringlets of his musky hair Wav'd on the bosom of the wanton air: With modest grace, the goddess he addrest, And, thoughtless, thus preferr'd his fond request: ‘Queen of the world! whose wide-extended sway, ‘Gay youth, firm manhood, and cold age obey, ‘Grant me, while life's fresh blooming roses smile, ‘The day with varied pleasures to beguile. ‘Let me on beds of dewy flowers recline, ‘And quaff, with glowing lips, the sparkling wine; ‘Grant me to feed on beauty's rifled charms, ‘And clasp a willing damsel in my arms,— ‘Her bosom, fairer than a hill of snow, ‘And gently bounding like a playful roe: ‘Her lips, more fragrant than the summer air; ‘And sweet as Scythian musk, her hyacinthine hair; ‘Let new delights each dancing hour employ, ‘Sport follow sport, and joy succeed to joy.’ The goddess grants the simple youth's request, And, mildly, thus accosts her lovely guest: ‘On that smooth mirror, full of magic light, ‘Awhile, dear Maia, fix thy wandering sight.’ She looks; and in th'enchanted crystal sees A bower o'er-canopied with tufted trees: The wanton stripling lies beneath the shade; And, by his side, reclines a blooming maid; O'er her fair limbs a silken mantle flows, Through which her youthful beauty softly glows, And, part conceal'd and part disclos'd to sight, Through the thin texture casts a ruddy light; As the ripe clusters of the mantling vine Beneath the verdant foliage, faintly, shine, And, fearing to be view'd by envious day, Their glowing tints unwillingly display. The youth, while joy sits sparkling in his eyes, Pants on her neck, and on her bosom dies; From her smooth cheek nectareous dew he sips, And all his soul comes breathing to his lips. But Maia turns her modest eyes away, And blushes to behold their amorous play. She looks again; and sees, with sad surprise, On the clear glass far different scenes arise: The bower, which late outshone the rosy morn, O'erhung with weeds she saw, and rough with thorn; With sting of asps, the leafless plants were wreath'd; And curling adders gales of venom breath'd:— Low sat the stripling on the faded ground; And, in a mournful knot, his arms were bound; His eyes, that shot before a sunny beam, Now scarcely shed a saddening, dying gleam, Faint as a glimm'ring taper's wasted light, Or a dull ray that streaks the cloudy night:— His crystal vase was on the pavement roll'd, And from the bank was fall'n his cup of gold; From which, th'envenom'd dregs of deadly hue Flow'd on the ground, in streams of baleful dew, And, slowly stealing through the wither'd bow'r, Poison'd each plant, and blasted every flow'r: Fled were his slaves, and fled his yielding fair, And each gay phantom was dissolv'd in air; Whilst in their place was left a ruthless train, Despair, and grief, remorse, and raging pain. Aside the damsel turns her weeping eyes, And sad reflections in her bosom rise; To whom thus, mildly, speaks the radiant queen: ‘Take sage example from this moral scene; ‘See! how vain pleasures sting the lips they kiss, ‘How asps are hid beneath the bowers of bliss! ‘Whilst ever fair the flow'r of temperance blows, ‘Unchang'd her leaf, and without thorn her rose; ‘Smiling she darts her glittering branch on high, ‘And spreads her fragrant blossoms to the sky.’ Next, tow'rd the throne she saw a knight Glory. advance; Erect he stood, and shook a quiv'ring lance; A fiery dragon on his helmet shone; And on his buckler beam'd a golden sun; O'er his broad bosom blaz'd his jointed mail With many a gem, and many a shining scale; He trod the sounding floor with princely mien, And thus with haughty words address'd the queen: ‘Let falling kings beneath my javelin bleed, ‘And bind my temples with a victor's meed; ‘Let every realm that feels the solar ray, ‘Shrink at my frown, and own my regal sway: ‘Let Ind's rich banks declare my deathless fame, ‘And trembling Ganges dread my potent name.’ The queen consented to the warrior's pray'r; And his bright banners floated in the air; He bade his darts in steely tempests fly, Flames burst the clouds, and thunder shake the sky; Death aim'd his lance, earth trembled at his nod, And crimson conquest glow'd where'er he trod. And now, the damsel, fix'd in deep amaze, Th'enchanted glass with eager look surveys: She sees the hero in his dusky tent, His guards retir'd, his glimm'ring taper spent; His spear, vain instrument of dying praise, On the rich floor, with idle state, he lays; His gory falchion near his pillow stood, And stain'd the ground with drops of purple blood; A busy page his nodding helm unlac'd, And on the couch his scaly hauberk plac'd: Now on the bed his weary limbs he throws, Bath'd in the balmy dew of soft repose: In dreams he rushes o'er the gloomy field, He sees new armies fly, new heroes yield; Warm with the vigorous conflict he appears, And ev'n in slumber seems to move the spheres. But lo! the faithless page, with stealing tread, Advances to the champion's naked head; With his sharp dagger wounds his bleeding breast, And steeps his eyelids in eternal rest: Then cries, (and waves the steel that drops with gore,) ‘The tyrant dies; oppression is no more.’ Now came an aged sire Riches., with trembling pace; Sunk were his eyes, and pale his ghastly face; A ragged weed of dusky hue he wore, And on his back a ponderous coffer bore. The queen with faltering speech he thus addrest: ‘O, fill with gold thy true adorer's chest!’ ‘Behold,’ said she, and wav'd her pow'rful hand, ‘Where yon rich hills in glittering order stand: ‘There load thy coffer with the golden store; ‘Then bear it full away, and ask no more.’ With eager steps he took his hasty way, Where the bright coin in heaps unnumber'd lay; There, hung enamour'd o'er the gleaming spoil, Scoop'd the gay dross, and bent beneath the toil. But bitter was his anguish, to behold The coffer widen, and its sides unfold: And, every time he heap'd the darling ore, His greedy chest grew larger than before; Till, spent with pain, and falling o'er his hoard, With his sharp steel his maddening breast he gor'd: On the lov'd heap he cast his closing eye, Contented on a golden couch to die. A stripling, with the fair adventure pleas'd, Stepp'd forward, and the massy coffer seiz'd; But with surprise he saw the stores decay, And all the long-sought treasures melt away: In winding streams the liquid metal roll'd, And through the palace ran a flood of gold. Next, to the shrine advanc'd a reverend sage Knowledge., Whose beard was hoary with the frost of age; His few grey locks a sable fillet bound, And his dark mantle flow'd along the ground: Grave was his port, yet show'd a bold neglect, And fill'd the young beholder with respect; Time's envious hand had plough'd his wrinkled face, Yet on those wrinkles sat superior grace; Still full of fire appear'd his vivid eye, Darted quick beams, and seem'd to pierce the sky. At length, with gentle voice and look serene, He wav'd his hand, and thus address'd the queen: ‘Twice forty winters tip my beard with snow, ‘And age's chilling gusts around me blow: ‘In early youth, by contemplation led, ‘With high pursuits my flatter'd thoughts were fed; ‘To nature first my labors were confin'd, ‘And all her charms were open'd to my mind, ‘Each flower that glisten'd in the morning dew, ‘And every shrub that in the forest grew: ‘From earth to heaven I cast my wond'ring eyes, ‘Saw suns unnumber'd sparkle in the skies, ‘Mark'd the just progress of each rolling sphere, ‘Describ'd the seasons, and reform'd the year. ‘At length sublimer studies I began, ‘And fix'd my level'd telescope on man; ‘Knew all his powers, and all his passions trac'd, ‘What virtue rais'd him, and what vice debas'd: ‘But when I saw his knowledge so confin'd, ‘So vain his wishes, and so weak his mind, ‘His soul, a bright obscurity at best, ‘And rough with tempests his afflicted breast, ‘His life, a flower ere evening sure to fade, ‘His highest joys, the shadow of a shade; ‘To thy fair court I took my weary way, ‘Bewail my folly, and heaven's laws obey, ‘Confess my feeble mind for prayers unfit, ‘And to my Maker's will my soul submit: ‘Great empress of yon orb that rolls below, ‘On me the last best gift of heaven bestow.’ He spoke: a sudden cloud his senses stole, And thickening darkness swam o'er all his soul; His vital spark her earthly cell forsook, And into air her fleeting progress took. Now, from the throng a deafening sound was heard, And all at once their various prayers preferr'd; The goddess, wearied with the noisy crowd, Thrice wav'd her silver wand, and spoke aloud: ‘Our ears no more with vain petitions tire, ‘But take unheard whate'er you first desire.’ She said: each wish'd, and what he wish'd obtain'd; And wild confusion in the palace reign'd. But Maia, now grown senseless with delight, Cast on an emerald ring her roving sight; And, ere she could survey the rest with care, Wish'd on her hand the precious gem to wear. Sudden the palace vanish'd from her sight, And the gay fabric melted into night; But, in its place, she view'd with weeping eyes Huge rocks around her, and sharp cliffs arise: She sat deserted on the naked shore, Saw the curl'd waves, and heard the tempest roar; Whilst on her finger shone the fatal ring, A weak defence from hunger's pointed sting, From sad remorse, from comfortless despair, And all the painful family of care! Frantic with grief her rosy cheek she tore, And rent her locks, her darling charge no more: But when the night his raven wing had spread, And hung with sable every mountain's head, Her tender limbs were numb'd with biting cold, And round her feet the curling billows roll'd; With trembling arms a rifted crag she grasp'd, And the rough rock with hard embraces clasp'd. While thus she stood, and made a piercing moan, By chance her emerald touch'd the rugged stone; That moment gleam'd from heaven a golden ray, And taught the gloom to counterfeit the day: A winged youth, for mortal eyes too fair, Shot, like a meteor, through the dusky air; His heavenly charms o'ercame her dazzled sight, And drown'd her senses in a flood of light; His sunny plumes, descending, he display'd; And, softly, thus address'd the mournful maid: ‘Say, thou, who dost yon wondrous ring possess, ‘What cares disturb thee, or what wants oppress; ‘To faithful ears disclose thy secret grief, ‘And hope (so heaven ordains) a quick relief.’ The maid replied: ‘Ah, sacred genius! bear ‘A hopeless damsel from this land of care; ‘Waft me to softer climes and lovelier plains, ‘Where nature smiles, and spring eternal reigns.’ She spoke; and, swifter than the glance of thought, To a fair isle his sleeping charge he brought. Now morning breath'd: the scented air was mild, Each meadow blossom'd, and each valley smil'd; On every shrub the pearly dewdrops hung, On every branch a feather'd warbler sung; The cheerful spring her flowery chaplets wove, And incense-breathing gales perfum'd the grove. The damsel rose; and, lost in glad surprise, Cast round the gay expanse her opening eyes, That shone with pleasure, like a starry beam, Or moonlight sparkling on a silver stream. She thought some nymph must haunt that lovely scene, Some woodland goddess, or some fairy queen; At least she hop'd in some sequester'd vale To hear the shepherd tell his amorous tale: Led by these flattering hopes,—from glade to glade, From lawn to lawn, with hasty steps she stray'd; But not a nymph by stream or fountain stood, And not a fairy glided through the wood; No damsel wanton'd o'er the dewy flow'rs, No shepherd sung beneath the rosy bow'rs: On every side she saw vast mountains rise, That thrust their daring foreheads in the skies; The rocks of polish'd alabaster seem'd, And in the sun their lofty summits gleam'd. She call'd aloud; but not a voice replied, Save Echo babbling from the mountain's side. By this, had night o'ercast the gloomy scene, And twinkling stars emblaz'd the blue serene:— Yet on she wander'd—till, with grief opprest, She fell; and, falling, smote her snowy breast: Now, to the heavens her guilty head she rears, And pours her bursting sorrow into tears; Then plaintive speaks, ‘Ah, fond mistaken maid! ‘How was thy mind by gilded hopes betray'd! ‘Why didst thou wish for bowers and flowery hills, ‘For smiling meadows, and for purling rills; ‘Since on those hills no youth or damsel roves, ‘No shepherd haunts the solitary groves? ‘Ye meads that glow with intermingled dyes, ‘Ye flowering palms that from yon hillocks rise, ‘Ye quivering brooks that softly murmur by, ‘Ye panting gales that on the branches die; ‘Ah! why has Nature through her gay domain ‘Display'd your beauties, yet display'd in vain? ‘In vain, ye flowers, you boast your vernal bloom, ‘And waste in barren air your fresh perfume. ‘Ah! leave, ye wanton birds, yon lonely spray; ‘Unheard you warble, and unseen you play: ‘Yet stay till fate has fix'd my early doom, ‘And strow with leaves a hapless damsel's tomb. ‘Some grot or grassy bank shall be my bier, ‘My maiden hearse unwater'd with a tear.’ Thus while she mourns, o'erwhelm'd in deep despair, She rends her silken robes, and golden hair: Her fatal ring, the cause of all her woes, On a hard rock with maddening rage she throws; The gem, rebounding from the stone, displays Its verdant hue, and sheds refreshing rays: Sudden descends the Genius of the Ring, And drops celestial fragrance from his wing; Then speaks: ‘Who calls me from the realms of day? ‘Ask, and I grant; command, and I obey!’ She drank his melting words with ravish'd ears, And stopp'd the gushing current of her tears; Then kiss'd his skirts, that like a ruby glow'd, And said, ‘O bear me to my sire's abode!’ Strait, o'er her eyes a shady veil arose, And all her soul was lull'd in still repose. By this, with flow'rs the rosy-finger'd dawn Had spread each dewy hill and verdurous lawn;— She wak'd; and saw a new built tomb, that stood In the dark bosom of a solemn wood, While these sad sounds her trembling ears invade,— ‘Beneath yon marble, sleeps thy father's shade.’ She sigh'd; she wept; she struck her pensive breast; And bade his urn in peaceful slumber rest. And now, in silence, o'er the gloomy land, She saw advance a slowly-winding band; Their cheeks were veil'd, their robes of mournful hue Flow'd o'er the lawn, and swept the pearly dew; O'er the fresh turf they sprinkled sweet perfume, And strow'd with flowers the venerable tomb. A graceful matron walk'd before the train, And tun'd in notes of woe the funeral strain: When from her face her silken veil she drew, The watchful maid her aged mother knew. O'erpow'r'd with bursting joy, she runs to meet The mourning dame, and falls before her feet. The matron with surprise her daughter rears, Hangs on her neck, and mingles tears with tears. Now o'er the tomb their hallow'd rites they pay, And form with lamps an artificial day: Ere long the damsel reach'd her native vale, And told, with joyful heart, her moral tale; Resign'd to heaven, and lost to all beside, She liv'd contented, and contented died.

In the Bhasha language her name is written DROPTY.. It fortun'd, at an idle hour, This five-mal'd single-femal'd flow'r One balmy morn of fruitful May Through vales and meadows took its way. A low thatch'd mansion met their eye In trees umbrageous bosom'd high; Near it (no sight, young maids! for you) A temple rose to Mahadew The Indian JUPITER.. A thorny hedge and reedy gate Enclos'd the garden's homely state; Plain in its neatness: thither wend The princes and their lovely friend.

Aloft a solitary fruit, Full sixty cubits from the root, Kiss'd by the breeze, luxuriant hung, Soft Chrysolite with em'ralds strung. ‘Try we,’ said Erjun indiscreet, ‘If yon proud fruit be sharp or sweet; ‘My shaft its parent stalk shall wound: ‘Receive it, ere it reach the ground.’ Swift as his word, an arrow flew: The dropping prize besprent with dew The brothers, in contention gay, Catch, and on gather'd herbage lay.

But radiant with ethereal fire: Nared alone could Bards inspire In lofty Slokes Tetrasticks without rhyme. his mien to trace, And unimaginable grace. With human voice, in human form, He mildly spake and hush'd the storm: ‘O mortals, ever prone to ill! ‘Too rashly Erjun prov'd his skill. ‘Yon fruit a pious Muny An inspired writer: twenty are so called. owns, ‘Assistant of our heav'nly thrones. ‘The golden pulp each month renew'd, ‘Supplies him with ambrosial food. ‘Should he the daring archer curse, ‘Not Mentra Incantation. deep, nor magic verse, ‘Your gorgeous palaces could save ‘From flames, your embers, from the wave This will receive illustration from a passage in the Ramayen: ‘Even he, who cannot be slain by the ponderous arms of Indra, nor by those of Caly, nor by the terrible Cheera (or Discus) of Vishnu, shall be destroyed, if a Brahmen execrate him, as if he were consumed by fire.’. The princes, whom th'immod'rate blaze Forbids their sightless eyes to raise, With doubled hands his aid implore, And vow submission to his lore. ‘One remedy, and simply one, ‘Or take,’ said he, ‘or be undone: ‘Let each his crimes or faults confess, ‘The greatest name, omit the less; ‘Your actions, words, e'en thoughts reveal; ‘No part must Draupady conceal: ‘So shall the fruit, as each applies ‘The faithful charm, ten cubits rise; ‘Till, if the dame be frank and true, ‘It join the branch where late it grew.’ He smil'd and shed a transient gleam; Then vanish'd like a morning dream. Now, long entranc'd, each waking brother Star'd with amazement on another, Their consort's cheek forgot its glow, And pearly tears began to flow; When Yudishteir, high-gifted man, His plain confession thus began: ‘Inconstant fortune's wreathed smiles, ‘Duryódhen's rage, Duryódhen's wiles, ‘Fires rais'd for this devoted head, ‘E'en poison for my brethren spread, ‘My wand'rings through wild scenes of woe, ‘And persecuted life you know. ‘Rude wassailers defiled my halls, ‘And riot shook my palace-walls, ‘My treasures wasted.

Embolden'd by this fair success, Next Erjun hasten'd to confess: ‘When I with Aswattháma fought; ‘My noose the fell assassin caught; ‘My spear transfixed him to the ground: ‘His giant limbs firm cordage bound: ‘His holy thread extorted awe, ‘Spar'd by religion and by law; ‘But, when his murd'rous hands I view'd ‘In blameless kindred gore imbued, ‘Fury my boiling bosom sway'd, ‘And Rage unsheath'd my willing blade: ‘Then, had not Crishna's arm divine ‘With gentle touch suspended mine, ‘This hand a Brahmen had destroy'd, ‘And vultures with his blood been cloy'd.’— The fruit, forgiving Erjun's dart, Ten cubits rose with eager start. Flush'd with some tints of honest shame, Bheima to his confession came: ‘'Twas at a feast for battles won ‘From Dhriteráshtra's guileful son, ‘High on the board in vases pil'd ‘All vegetable nature smil'd: ‘Proud Anaras Ananas. his beauties told, ‘His verdant crown and studs of gold, ‘To Dallim Pomegranate. whose soft rubies laugh'd ‘Bursting with juice, that gods have quaff'd; ‘Ripe Kellas Plantains. here in heaps were seen, ‘Kellas, the golden and the green, ‘With Ambas Mangos. priz'd on distant coasts, ‘Whose birth the fertile Ganga boasts: ‘(Some gleam like silver, some outshine ‘Wrought ingots from Besoara's mine:) ‘Corindas there, too sharp alone, ‘With honey mix'd, impurpled shone; ‘Talsans Palmyra-fruit. his liquid crystal spread ‘Pluck'd from high Tara's tufted head; ‘Round Jamas Rose Apples. delicate as fair, ‘Like rose-water perfum'd the air; ‘Bright salvers high rais'd Comlas Oranges. held ‘Like topazes, which Amrit The Hindu Nectar. swell'd; ‘While some delicious Attas Custard Apples. bore ‘And Catels Jaik-fruit. warm, a sugar'd store; ‘Others with Béla's grains were heap'd, ‘And mild Papayas honey-steep'd; ‘Or sweet Ajeírs Guayavas. the red and pale, ‘Sweet to the taste and in the gale. ‘Here mark'd we purest basons fraught ‘With sacred cream and fam'd Joghrát; ‘Nor saw we not rich bowls contain ‘The Chawla's Rice. light nutritious grain, ‘Some virgin-like in native pride, ‘And some with strong Haldea Turmerick. dyed; ‘Some tasteful to dull palates made ‘If Merich Indian Pepper. lend his fervent aid, ‘Or Langa Cloves. shap'd like od'rous nails, ‘Whose scent o'er groves of spice prevails, ‘Or Adda Ginger., breathing gentle heat, ‘Or Joutery Mace. both warm and sweet. ‘Supiary Areca-nut. next (in Pána Betel-leaf. chew'd, ‘And Catha What we call Japan earth. with strong pow'rs endued, ‘Mix'd with Elachy's Cardamums. glowing seeds, ‘Which some remoter climate breeds,) ‘Near Jeifel Nutmeg. sate like Jeifel fram'd, ‘Though not for equal fragrance nam'd: ‘Last, Nárgal Cocoanut., whom all ranks esteem, ‘Pour'd in full cups his dulcet stream: ‘Long I survey'd the doubtful board ‘With each high delicacy stor'd; ‘Then freely gratified my soul, ‘From many a dish, and many a bowl, ‘Till health was lavish'd, as my time: ‘Intemp'rance was my fatal crime.’ Up rose the fruit; and now mid-way Suspended shone like blazing day.

Sehdio, with youthful ardour bold, Thus, penitent, his failings told: ‘From clouds, by folly rais'd, these eyes ‘Experience clear'd, and made me wise; ‘For, when the crash of battle roar'd, ‘When death rain'd blood from spear and sword, ‘When, in the tempest of alarms, ‘Horse roll'd on horse, arms clash'd with arms, ‘Such acts I saw by others done, ‘Such perils brav'd, such trophies won, ‘That, while my patriot bosom glow'd, ‘Though some faint skill, some strength I show'd, ‘And, no dull gazer on the field, ‘This hero slew, that forc'd to yield, ‘Yet, meek humility, to thee, ‘When Erjun fought, low sunk my knee: ‘But, ere the din of war began, ‘When black'ning cheeks just mark'd the man ‘Myself invincible I deem'd, ‘And great, without a rival, seem'd. ‘Whene'er I sought the sportful plain, ‘No youth of all the martial train ‘With arm so strong, or eye so true ‘The Checra's A radiated metalline ring, used as a missile weapon. pointed circle threw; ‘None, when the polish'd cane we bent, ‘So far the light-wing'd arrow sent; ‘None from the broad elastic reed, ‘Like me, gave Agnyastra Fire-arms, or rockets, early known in India. speed, ‘Or spread its flames with nicer art ‘In many an unextinguish'd dart; ‘Or, when in imitated fight ‘We sported till departing light, ‘None saw me to the ring advance ‘With falchion keen or quiv'ring lance, ‘Whose force my rooted seat could shake, ‘Or on my steel impression make: ‘No charioteer, no racer fleet ‘O'ertook my wheels or rapid feet. ‘Next, when the woody heights we sought, ‘With madd'ning elephants I fought: ‘In vain their high-priz'd tusks they gnash'd; ‘Their trunked heads my Geda A mace, or club. mash'd. ‘No buffalo, with phrensy strong, ‘Could bear my clatt'ring thunder long; ‘No pard or tiger, from the wood ‘Reluctant brought, this arm withstood. ‘Pride in my heart his mansion fix'd, ‘And with pure drops black poison mix'd.’ Swift rose the fruit, exalted now Ten cubits from his natal bough. Fair Draupady, with soft delay, Then spake: ‘Heav'n's mandate I obey; ‘Though nought essential to be known, ‘Has heav'n to learn, or I to own. ‘When scarce a damsel, scarce a child, ‘In early bloom your handmaid smil'd, ‘Love of the World her fancy mov'd, ‘Vain pageantry her heart approv'd: ‘Her form, she thought, and lovely mien, ‘All must admire, when all had seen: ‘A thirst of pleasure and of praise ‘(With shame I speak) engross'd my days; ‘Nor were my night-thoughts, I confess, ‘Free from solicitude for dress; ‘How best to bind my flowing hair ‘With art, yet with an artless air; ‘(My hair, like musk in scent and hue; ‘Oh! blacker far and sweeter too;) ‘In what nice braid or glossy curl ‘To fix a diamond or a pearl, ‘And where to smooth the love-spread toils ‘With nard or jasmin's fragrant oils; ‘How to adjust the golden Teic Properly Teica, an ornament of gold, placed above the nose., ‘And most adorn my forehead sleek; ‘What Condals Pendents. should emblaze my ears, ‘Like Seita's waves SEITA CUND, or the Pool of Seita the wife of RAM, is the name given to the wonderful Spring at Mengeir, with boiling water of exquisite clearness and purity. or Seita's tears Her tears, when she was made captive by the giant Rawan.; ‘How elegantly to dispose ‘Bright circlets from my well-form'd nose; ‘With strings of rubies how to deck, ‘Or em'rald rows, my stately neck, ‘While some that ebon tow'r embrac'd, ‘Some pendent sought my slender waist; ‘How next my purfled veil to choose ‘From silken stores of varied hues; ‘Which would attract the roving view, ‘Pink, violet, purple, orange, blue; ‘The loveliest mantle to select, ‘Or unembellish'd or bedeck'd; ‘And how my twisted scarf to place ‘With most inimitable grace; ‘(Too thin its warp, too fine its woof, ‘For eyes of males not beauty-proof;) ‘What skirts the mantle best would suit, ‘Ornate with stars or tissued fruit, ‘The flow'r-embroider'd or the plain ‘With silver or with golden vein; ‘The Chury A small mirror worn in a ring. bright, which gayly shows ‘Fair objects, aptly to compose; ‘How each smooth arm and each soft wrist ‘By richest Cosecs Bracelets. might be kiss'd; ‘While some, my taper ankles round, ‘With sunny radiance ting'd the ground. ‘O waste of many a precious hour! ‘O Vanity, how vast thy pow'r! Cubits twice four th'ambrosial flew, Still from its branch disjoin'd by two. Each husband now, with wild surprise, His compeers and his consort eyes; When Yudishteir: ‘Thy female breast ‘Some faults, perfidious, hath suppress'd. ‘Oh! give the close-lock'd secret room, ‘Unfold its bud, expand its bloom; ‘Lest, sinking with our crumbled halls, ‘We see red flames devour their walls.’ Abash'd, yet with a decent pride, Firm Draupady the fact denied; Till, through an orchard alley green, The limit of that sacred scene, She saw the dreaded Muny go With steps majestically slow; Then said: (a stifled sigh she stole, And show'd the conflict of her soul By broken speech and flutt'ring heart: ‘One trifle more I must impart: ‘A Brahmen learn'd, of pure intent ‘And look demure, one morn you sent, ‘With me, from Sanscrit old, to read ‘Each high Puran A Mythological and Historical Poem. each holy Veid. ‘His thread, which Brehmá's lineage show'd, ‘O'er his left shoulder graceful flow'd; ‘Of Crishna and his nymphs he redde, ‘How with nine Maids the dance he led; ‘How they ador'd, and he repaid ‘Their homage in the sylvan shade. ‘While this gay tale my spirits cheer'd, ‘So keen the Pendit's eyes appear'd, ‘So sweet his voice—a blameless fire ‘This bosom could not but inspire. ‘Bright as a God he seem'd to stand. ‘The rev'rend volume left his hand, ‘With mine he press'd’—With deep despair Brothers on Brothers wildly stare: From Erjun flew a wrathful glance; Tow'rd them they saw their dread advance; Then, trembling, breathless, pale with fear, ‘Hear!’ said the Matron, ‘calmly hear! ‘By Tulsy's leaf the truth I speak— ‘The Brahmen only kiss'd my cheek.’ Strait its full height the wonder rose, Glad with its native branch to close. Now to the walk approach'd the Sage, Exulting in his verdant age: His hands, that touch'd his front, express'd Due rev'rence to each princely guest, Whom to his rural board he led In simple delicacy spread, With curds their palates to regale, And cream-cups from the Gopia's pail. Could you, ye Fair! like this black wife, Restore us to primeval life, And bid that apple, pluck'd for Eve By him, who might all wives deceive, Hang from its parent bough once more Divine and perfect, as before, Would you confess your little faults? (Great ones were never in your thoughts;) Would you the secret wish unfold, Or in your heart's full casket hold? Would you disclose your inmost mind, And speak plain truth, to bless mankind? ‘What!’ said the guardian of our realm, ‘With waving crest and fiery helm, ‘What! are the Fair, whose heav'nly smiles ‘Rain glory through my cherish'd Isles, ‘Are they less virtuous or less true ‘Than Indian dames of sooty hue? ‘No, by these arms. The cold surmise ‘And doubt injurious vainly rise. ‘Yet dares a bard, who better knows, ‘This point distrustfully propose; ‘Vain fabler now! though oft before ‘His harp has cheer'd my sounding shore.’ With brow austere the martial maid Spoke, and majestic trod the glade: To that fell cave her course she held, Where Scandal, bane of mortals, dwell'd. Outstretch'd on filth the pest she found, Black fetid venom streaming round: A gloomy light just serv'd to show The darkness of the den below. Britannia with resistless might Soon dragg'd him from his darling night: The snakes, that o'er his body curl'd And flung his poison through the world, Confounded with the flash of day, Hiss'd horribly a hellish lay. His eyes with flames and blood suffus'd, Long to the ethereal beam unus'd, Fierce in their gory sockets roll'd; And desperation made him bold: Pleas'd with the thought of human woes, On scaly dragon feet he rose. Thus, when Asurs with impious rage, Durst horrid war with Dévtás wage, And darted many a burning mass E'en on the brow of gemm'd Cailás, High o'er the rest, on serpents rear'd, The griesly king of Deits appear'd. The nymph beheld the fiend advance, And couch'd the far-extending lance: Dire drops he threw; th'infernal tide Her helm and silver hauberk dyed: Her moonlight shield before her hung; The monster struck, the monster stung: Her spear with many a griding wound Fast nail'd him to the groaning ground. The wretch, from juster vengeance free, Immortal born by heav'n's decree, With chains of adamant secur'd, Deep in cold gloom she left immur'd. Now reign at will, victorious Fair! In British or in Indian air; Still with each envying flow'r adorn Your tresses radiant as the morn; Still let each Asiatic dye Rich tints for your gay robes supply; Still through the dance's labyrinth float, And swell the sweetly-lengthen'd note; Still, on proud steeds or glitt'ring cars, Rise on the course like beamy stars; And when charm'd circles round you close, Of rhyming bards and smiling beaux, Whilst all with eager looks contend Their wit or worth to recommend, Still let your mild, yet piercing, eyes Impartially adjudge the prize. SONGS AND BALLADS. A PERSIAN SONG OF HAFIZ. Sweet maid, if thou wouldst charm my sight; And, bid these arms thy neck infold; That rosy cheek, that lily hand, Would give thy poet more delight Than all Bocara's vaunted gold, Than all the gems of Samarcand. Boy! let yon liquid ruby flow, And bid thy pensive heart be glad, Whate'er the frowning zealots say:— Tell them their Eden cannot show A stream so clear as Rocnabad, A bower so sweet as Mosellay. O! when these fair, perfidious maids, Whose eyes our secret haunts infest, Their dear destructive charms display;— Each glance my tender breast invades, And robs my wounded soul of rest; As Tartars seize their destin'd prey. In vain with love our bosoms glow: Can all our tears, can all our sighs, New lustre to those charms impart? Can cheeks, where living roses blow, Where nature spreads her richest dyes, Require the borrow'd gloss of art? Speak not of fate;—ah! change the theme, And talk of odours, talk of wine, Talk of the flow'rs that round us bloom:— 'Tis all a cloud, 'tis all a dream: To love and joy thy thoughts confine, Nor hope to pierce the sacred gloom. Beauty has such resistless power, That even the chaste Egyptian dame Sigh'd for the blooming Hebrew boy; For her how fatal was the hour, When to the banks of Nilus came A youth so lovely and so coy! But ah, sweet maid! my counsel hear,— (Youth should attend when those advise Whom long experience renders sage,) While music charms the ravish'd ear; While sparkling cups delight our eyes, Be gay; and scorn the frowns of age. What cruel answer have I heard! And yet, by heaven! I love thee still: Can aught be cruel from thy lip? Yet say, how fell that bitter word From lips which streams of sweetness fill, Which nought but drops of honey sip? Go boldly forth, my simple lay, Whose accents flow with artless ease, Like orient pearls at random strung: Thy notes are sweet, the damsels say; But O! far sweeter, if they please The nymph for whom these notes are sung. A SONG, From the Persian, paraphrased in the Measure of the Original. I Sweet as the rose that scents the gale, Bright as the lily of the vale, Yet with a heart like summer hail, Marring each beauty thou bearest. II Beauty like thine, all nature thrills; And when the Moon her circle fills, Pale she beholds those rounder hills, Which on the breast thou wearest. III Where could those peerless flow'rets blow? Whence are the thorns that near them grow? Wound me, but smile, O lovely foe! Smile on the heart thou tearest. IV Sighing, I view that cypress waist, Doom'd to afflict me till embrac'd; Sighing, I view that eye too chaste, Like the new blossom smiling. V Spreading thy toils with hands divine, Softly thou wavest like a pine, Darting thy shafts at hearts like mine, Senses, and soul beguiling. VI See at thy feet no vulgar slave, Frantic with love's enchanting wave, Thee, ere he seek the gloomy grave, Thee his blest idol styling. PLASSEY-PLAIN It can scarcely be necessary to recall to the recollection of the reader, the victory gained by Lord Clive, over Seraj'uddoula, Subahdar or Viceroy of Bengal, on Plassey-Plain., A BALLAD, Addressed to Lady Jones by her Husband. Aug. 3, 1784. T'is not of Jàrfer, nor of Clive, On Plassey's glorious field I sing; 'Tis of the best good girl alive, Which most will deem a prettier thing. The Sun, in gaudy palanqueen, Curtain'd with purple, fring'd with gold, Firing no more heav'n's vault serene, Retir'd to sup with Ganges old. When Anna, to her bard long dear, (Who lov'd not Anna on the banks Of Elwy swift, or testa clear?) Tripp'd thro' the palm grove's verdant ranks. Where thou, blood-thirsty Subahdar, Wast wont thy kindred beasts to chase, Till Britain's vengeful hounds of war, Chas'd thee to that well-destin'd place. She knew what monsters rang'd the brake, Stain'd like thyself with human gore, The hooded, and the necklac'd snake, The tiger huge, and tusked boar. To worth, and innocence approv'd, E'en monsters of the brake are friends: Thus o'er the plain at ease she mov'd:— Who fears offence that ne'er offends? Wild perroquets first silence broke, Eager of dangers near to prate; But they in English never spoke, And she began her moors A common expression for the Hindustanee, or vernacular language of India. of late. Next, patient dromedaries stalk'd, And wish'd her speech to understand; But Arabic was all they talk'd:— Oh, had her Arab been at hand! A serpent dire, of size minute, With necklace brown and freckled side, Then hasten'd from her path to shoot, And o'er the narrow causey glide. Three elephants, to warn her, call, But they no western tongue could speak; Tho' once, at Philobiblian stall, Fame says a brother jabber'd Greek. Superfluous was their friendly zeal; For what has conscious truth to fear? Fierce boars her pow'rful influence feel, Mad buffaloes, or furious deer. E'en tigers, never aw'd before, And panting for so rare a food, She dauntless heard around her roar, While they the jackals vile pursued. No wonder since, on Elfin Land, Prais'd in sweet verse by bards adept, A lion vast was known to stand, Fair virtue's guard, while Una slept. Yet oh! had one her perils known, (Tho' all the lions in all space Made her security their own,) He ne'er had found a resting place. Au FIRMAMENT. ‘Would I were yon blue field above,’ (Said Plato, warbling am'rous lays,) ‘That with ten thousand eyes of love, ‘On thee for ever I might gaze.’ My purer love the wish disclaims, For were I, like Tiresias, blind, Still should I glow with heavenly flames, And gaze with rapture on thy mind. SONG. [Wake, ye nightingales, oh, wake!] Wake, ye nightingales, oh, wake! Can ye, idlers, sleep so long? Quickly this dull silence break; Burst enraptur'd into song: Shake your plumes, your eyes unclose, No pretext for more repose. Tell me not, that Winter drear Still delays your promis'd tale, That no blossoms yet appear, Save the snow-drop in the dale Tell me not the woods are bare;— Vain excuse! prepare! prepare! View the hillock, view the meads: All are verdant, all are gay; Julia comes, and with her leads Health, and Youth, and blooming May. When she smiles, fresh roses blow; Where she treads, fresh lilies grow. Hail! ye groves of Bagley, hail! Fear no more the chilling air: Can your beauties ever fail? Julia has pronounc'd you fair. She could cheer a cavern's gloom, She could make a desert bloom.</field>
