      <field name="fulltext">ORIGINAL POEMS. Prologue, for Mr. Garrick; [On the Duke's Return from Scotland.] Rebellion sleeps in peace;—and light-heel'd France Wakes, from her Highland-dream, and bagpipe dance. Blown from Mount Grampus into Belgian Wastes, Where moist Dutch ditches cool their cap'ring tastes. There let'em fish their forage-guard wash'd passes, And leer, from chin-deep march, at dry-shod lasses. Warring, like ducks, eat frogs, instead of pullet, And each stol'n cheese, they swim for, prove a bullet. Oft may those thieves, most christian, shift bad quarters, For worse,—and scour new climes, to catch new Tartars, 'Till sense of shame, invasion's cheek to flush, Bids their pale lilly, steal our rose's blush. Hail, to the sun-shine, that succeeds distress! The dawn, that dimm'd us, bids the evening bless! Happy the sorrow, that instructs, by pain; The rebel's rage endears the monarch's reign! 'Till home-felt menace shook the land's repose, Wealth's easy eye glanc'd scorn at absent foes: At length, by danger rous'd, attention came, Then war grew bus'ness, and revenge grew fame. Trade fann'd, with grateful help, the soldier's fire, Felt the protective warmth, and hugg'd it nigher. Then, the brave red-coat, measuring o'er the isle, March'd in claim'd brotherhood, from smile to smile. Bless'd by new friends, saw antient spleens relent, Cur'd prejudice—and conquer'd, as he went. Kind smil'd occasion, thro' the storm begun, 'Till from the cloud, out-flam'd our morning sun, Soul of the nations hope—the soldier's pride! The sov'reign's safety, and the subject's guide! Born to love all, and be, by all, belov'd, Mild, like his father's throne, and as unmov'd! In youth's warm prime, from all youth's passions free, Had love, and fire, and pity, not been three. Brave, beyond every curb, but judgment's call, Guardian of every right—and saves 'em all. Such, when he comes, the muses breast should burn, And her seats, echoing, hail his bless'd return; Here, when long wish'd, our happy eyes behold, Th' acknowledg'd conqueror, need his Name be told! Sent to Lord Chesterfield; writ on a blank Leaf, of a Poem, called, The Religion of Reason. Go, reason's off'ring, reason's guardian find, Bow to the saint, for works, not faith, enshrin'd. As near heav'n's height, as climbing nature can, Comes virtue's god-giv'n force, effus'd on man, Why, then, to rights, beyond ev'n virtue's claim, Bore man's paid worship, profanation's name. Worth, that transcends respect, new sense will raise, And skirts idolatry, or cripples praise: When thanks, found faint, bid sacrifice ensue, The grateful error robb'd not heav'n its due: The claim-full image sanctify'd the sin, Since God's sure likeness takes the godhead in. 'Tis the lie makes the idol.—He, who knelt To heav'n, least distant, heav'n's near influence felt. Here; then—could rev'rence custom's fog disperse, Had risen an Altar—now, receive a Verse. All, that the muse (or muse's God) makes mine, All, but ador'd, O Chesterfield! be thine. How has this venal age deserv'd thy care! Thy hand, thy head, thy heart, thy heav'n-heard pray'r! What pangs have three deaf kingdoms cost thy soul, 'Till we, by wrongs oppress'd, engag'd it whole. For realms so frail, so faultlesly to act! The sun, thro' midnight, scarce could more attract. Joy weds amazement, hope's high dawn to see! And every friend to fame, is sworn to thee. O, pard'ning, view the private Pen's address, Where will's warm impulse long'd to fire a Press: 'Till apter subject dares thy smile invite, Where foeless truth shall need no shadow'd light; Screen'd, I, behind my temple's pillar, kneel, And, like the gospel whisp'rer, hint my zeal. Prudently patient, curb a struggling flame, To no fool's comments, trust thy sacred name. Wait a theme's call, that asks no cov'ring cloud; Then, my pray'r claims thee—and my wish grows proud. To Lord Bolingbroke, writ on a blank Leaf of a Poem, which was sent him, by the Author. Go, Thought's lost child, born dark, beneath wit's pole, Seek the ray'd track, to taste's departed soul: Awfully conscious, dare the depths invade, Where silent St. John suns his pensive shade: There, if he smiles—'tis whole mankind's assent; Scorn the short world, thou leav'st, and die, content. To C?O. I Snar'd, in entangling mazes of thy charms, Teach me to shake these silky chains away; Slow, thy sweet force, my stubborn mind disarms, 'Till ev'n ambition bends, beneath thy sway, II What shall I do, to free my struggling soul, Bow'd, to the soft'ning biass of thy song? As circling straws, in whirlwinds, driving roll, So are my hurry'd passions swept along. III Fool, as I was!—I felt thy distant fire, E're, from those eyes, it flash'd undying flame; Yet, sure, said I—for once—I may aspire, And view that heav'n, whence all this brightness came. IV So, the light cork, that on the Thame's smooth side, Embay'd, glides buoyant, and just skims the shore, Edges, ambitious, to the rapid tide, And, rushing down the stream, returns no more. V Late, my free thoughts, unbounded, as the air, Could, with an eye-beam's swiftness, scale the sky; Wander, in starry worlds, and busy'd there, From human cares, and human passions, fly. VI Down to dark earth's deep center, could I roam, And, thro' her chasmy lab'rinths, wind my way; See Gold unripen'd, in its dusky home, And mark how springs, in veiny bendings, stray. VII Oft as th' alarming trumpet struck my ear, Or the big drum's dead beat hoarse-thund'ring rose, My summon'd soul sprung out, to war's wish'd sphere, And plung'd me in the ranks of fancy'd foes. VIII Wide, as unmeasur'd nature's trackless space, Untir'd imagination restless flew; Disdain'd to fix on object, or on place, And every moment, some fresh labour knew. IX C?o was then, unseen, unread, unknown;— Now, lovely tyrant, she usurps my mind; Devoted fancy vows itself her own: And my whole thought is, to one theme, confin'd. X Yet, pow'rful as she is—she doubts her lays; Blind, like the sun, to her own blazing flame; Transports the list'ning soul—engrosses praise, Yet humbly wishes—an immortal name. XI Oh! that I could but live, 'till that late day, When C?'s unremember'd name shall die! Then should I hope, full leisure to display Those unborn deeds, which in my bosom lie. XII But, as it is, our fleeting sands so fast Ebb to their end, and lead us to decay; That, e're we learn to see, our daylight's past, And, like a melting mist, life shrinks away. To Mr. Pope. The glow-worm scribblers, of a feeble age, Pale twinklers of an hour, provoke my rage; In each dark hedge, we start an insect fire, Which lives by night, and must at dawn expire. Yet, such their number, that their specks combine, And the unthinking vulgar swear they shine. Poets are prodigies, so greatly rare, They seem the tasks of heav'n, and built with care. Like suns unquench'd, unrival'd, and sublime, They roll immortal, o'er the wastes of time: Ages, in vain, close round, and snatch in fame, High over all, still shines the Poet's name! Lords of a life, that scorns the bounds of breath, They stretch existence—and awaken death. Pride of their envy'd climes! they plant renown, That shades the monarch's, by the muse's crown: To say, that Virgil, with Augustus shin'd, Does honour to the lord of half mankind. So, when three thousand years have wan'd away, And Pope is said to've liv'd, when George bore sway; Millions shall lend the king the poet's fame, And bless, implicit, the supported name. Stung by a Nettle Revenge, you see, is sure, though sometimes slow! Take this—'tis all the pain I'd have you know! There's odds enough, yet left, betwixt our smart, I sting your fingers, and you sting my heart. The Snuffers. Despis'd, and worthless, tho' I seem to be, Yon new-top'd flames owe their best light to me. Tho' scorn'd—you see, I can do service still! Some good lies hid, in every seeming ill. And hence, let fortune's fav'rites learn to know, That virtue's virtue, tho' in rags it go. On a Bee, that was swallowed, by a Lady, in a Glass of Wine. I Pretty! lost! advent'rous Bee! How pitiful thy case! A world of wealth was offer'd thee, But av'rice would not let thee see, The charms in Celia's face. II Keenly ey'd with lover's care, Thou had'st not lost her kiss! But halting at her lips, for more, Supply'd thyself with honied store, From magazines of bliss. The Lover's Degree of Comparison. Happy the man, who does Celinda view, More happy he who sees, and loves her too; Most happy, sure! of all mankind is he, Who, loving her, belov'd by her shall be. To a satirical young Lady. Forbear, loud thing! to live in laugh and jest, Wit is like love—the softest is the best! If thou, by this, wouldst lively thought proclaim, If empty praise is thy wild fancy's aim; A while, this salt may season single life, But no man's taste approves a picquant wife. Be wise, and match, and charm, by judgment's aid, Or witty, and despis'd, and die—a maid. So, the thin razors, which young learners please, Grow notch'd, and edgeless, by unmark'd degrees, 'Till worn, and blunted, by too frequent use, Th' experienc'd hand detects the steel's abuse: Then cheaply thrown aside, they gather dust, Like thee, neglected, 'till consum'd by rust. To Celinda, complaining that her Harpsichord was out of Tune. I. While, with well-acted anger, you complain, Still you attempt your charming task again; And still, with lovely petulance, complain, That still you strike the trembling strings, in vain. Still you complain! and still my wond'ring soul Is wildly beckon'd, by the wanton sound: Thro' my rais'd fancy circling phantoms roll, My thoughts, in fairy mazes, dance around! Still you complain, how ill your work is done, While gazing and astonish'd, I, Who feel myself already die, E'en while your strings you do but try, Am wildly wond'ring, when you once go on, Where I shall be—and how transform'd, anon! II. Ah! she begins! guard, guard thee, flutt'ring life, Dissolve not, in the blissful strife; What, tho' the thrilling pain wounds thro', and thro', Sharp as it is, 'tis pleasing too! Now proud, imperial reason, boast thy pow'r! Glorious, in high defyance, rise, And, while the charmer all her forces tries, While all her graces mix, in one bright show'r, And, round my dazzled senses, scatt'ring, fall; E'en while her smile-dress'd beauty fills my eyes, And life itself pierc'd by the musick, dies, To shew proud joys, that reason rules 'em all; At one strong effort, struggle thro' the charm, And e'en amidst the transport, wisely warm, In cool description, gather force to tell, What varying passions thy hot bosom swell. III. 'Tis well! disdainful beauty!—smile again! I'll do it, though with pain. Each piercing stroke, your flying singers give, Softens, dilates, and undulates my mind! I swell immense, beyond myself! and leave All taste of frail mortality behind. My beating heart, of heav'nly force possest, Knocks, with impatience at my earthy breast. Fain would it go, but knows not where! 'Tis gone, at once, and all dissolv'd in air! Again, 'tis here!—what wou'd the wond'rer say! It could not longer absent stay, But lost the heav'nly sound above, which summon'd it away! See! all impatient of delay, The raptur'd fugitive is downward sung, Clings to your dancing wires, tho' loosely strung, And hangs about the musick of your tongue. IV. Still you complain, still Love inspire! So, men, on Zembla's wint'ry coast, The pole's proud treasury of frost, When they, to their cold caves retire, Can sit, and freeze, amidst surrounding fire! What shall I do?—'tis certain death—to stay, And worse than death, to go away! Like men, who live in an infected air, I gape for breath, but every where, Admit the plague despair! Each tuneful accent arm'd with pointed pain, Drives thro' my blood, strong tides of new desire; My fev'rish soul is all on fire! And nature bends, like reeds, before each breezy strain! Yet still, tyrannie sporter, you complain! V. Ah! cruel fair! too late, alas! I see The needless stratagem, which pride of charms Has taught your beauty's, too sufficient arms! Oh! since with open force you conquer'd me, Why, (worthless since I seem to you to be) Why use you arts, to vanquish me again; You act, in this, as long-try'd champions do, Who fight with some unpractis'd foe, Whose weakness they despise, and know. At first, a seeming ignorance they display! With aukward gestures, wait each threaten'd blow, And, with a feign'd distrust, a while give way: But when, at length, resolv'd no more to toy, Their strength, and skill, they all at once employ! Like me, th' astonish'd enemy, amaz'd, And unprepar'd to meet such new alarms; When, in chill wonder, he a while has gaz'd, Trembles, kneels down, and throws away his arms. To the Preacher of an excellent Charity Sermon Forgive, great pleader of the poor man's cause! Thou just asserter of thy saviour's laws! Forgive the erring fondness of my lays, What muse, untir'd, can climb so steep a praise! Verse, for my own sake, not for thine, I chose, For he, who, with his own, would praise thy prose, Has, when his too officious task is done, But held a taper to the blazing sun. Could failing fancy reach my rising will, Or word's weak wind the sails of meaning fill; I wou'd—but thy reward would bankrupt man, And heav'n must pay it—for heav'n only can. If wealthy misers, who, by starts, bestow Some wind-rais'd drops, which, in their fortune's flow, Their breezy charities about them blow; If these stand blest, by heav'n's too kind decree, What nobler blessings are reserv'd for thee! Thee! who not only dost men's wants relieve, But teachest, backward thousands, how to give! Stand firm, great pillar of the church, you bless! May all your labours meet a like success! Though vulgar natures are to pity blind, Well-guided sight they, in your doctrine, find. Gross, as they are, and chill'd, by low desires, When warm they feel your heart-dissolving fires, Their souls, new-dipp'd, discharge the stains of sense, And take the creamy dye of innocence. With rev'rend joy, my charm'd attention hung, To catch the musick of your truth-blest tongue. Spread, and dissolv'd, by mercy's moral heat, My heart, in sighs, exhal'd to seek your feet! 'Twas far too mean a bliss, to look you thro', I wou'd have turn'd to air, and enter'd too! Still to have dwelt within you,—pure, like you! But why, thus weakly, should I praise your aim? The crowds, you sav'd from want, shall bless your name! The soul-shook widow's cries, and scalding tears, Whose speaking force has reach'd our sov'reign's ears, Shall climb the heights of heav'n's high palace, too, And, when they pray for Anna, plead for you: The groans of orphans, and the virgin's pray'rs, The mother's aided hopes, and father's cares, With moving rhet'rick shall invade the sky, And, as you bless'd them, here, bless you, on high. To the excellent Daughters of a deceas'd Lady. Why should ye thus, to prove but vainly kind, Add a weak body to a sickly mind? Could but your pious grief recal her breath, Or tears of duty win her back from death; We would not blame the passion you express, But share it with you, if'twould make it less! But oh! when certain death's uncertain hour Exerts his known, his unresisted pow'r; When we are summon'd from our cares, below, To joys, which living merit must not know; When souls, like your dear mother's, quit their clay, And change earth's darkness for eternal day: From their bliss-circled seats, perhaps, they view These humbler regions, which themselves once knew. And swell'd with thoughts, which make the angels kind, Pity the pledges, they have left behind. Tis true, the loss you mourn, is vastly great, But in that loss, your country shares your fate; The public good, her wishes would have done, Made ev'ry man, in ev'ry land, her son: Thence, lovely mourners! give us leave to prove, We ought to share your grief, who shar'd your mother's love. Yet, may all parties make their sorrow less, And you, and we, concern enough express; You may, with comfort, calm your ruffled mind, To think, your mother left her cares behind; And we, tho' losers, should be thankful too, Since we are still left rich, possessing you. Prologue, for Mr. Cibber, junior. Comes slowly, and reluctantly, forward; stands silent, and sideling, twirling his Hat—and, now and then, looking up, with a half-suppressed Leer of Irresolution. 'Tis I—tho' shame-fac'd,—modest The, now, tries ye, Don't let th' unlook'd-for change—too much surprize ye. Your loose deserter, now brought up for sentence, Uncocks his contrite phiz—and glouts repentance. Sinners should all feel shame. So far, plain fact is: Yet, some blush aukwardly—for want of practice. Ah! what can move hard hearts—if yours he misses, Whose penitential tweer stands crimp'd, as this is. [Here he puts on Drugger's attitude] Not Abel's three-tir'd squint more queerly show'd him, When the crack'd urinal had half-o'erflow'd him. Hem—now I'll pluck up grace—and make confession, Then (like snug papist)—tick, for new transgression, Some few wild oats I've sown: some, late—been mowing; And—not to lie—I've left young crops, yet, growing. Bear with slow penitence—or, spoil a convert: Much 'have I suffer'd—and no little done for't! I'm a poor sinful cur—heav'n un-bewhelp me! Be-mus'd—be-creditor'd—be-wiv'd, God help me! Plung'd, in a sea of woes—past all enduring; Yet, not one woe, but was—my own procuring. There now!—Let virtue ne'er expect man's pity, If truth, so plainly told, wants force to hit ye. Well; after all—I'm a wild chap—that's certain: And many a foolish farce, I've plaid my part in. Yet, search life through, truth ask'd will answer, sadly, Men, that act many parts, must act some madly; But, for my own—to whom hard-fortune gave one, Oft, in my life to come, I'll act a grave one. Nay, pray, don't laugh—As I'm a hopeful sinner, You shoudn't blue—so bashful a beginner! Sure, I may act grave parts—who here can borrow, Where tears by urn-fulls flow—from tragic sorrow. Lab'ring from dirge to catch, to gain your pardon, I'll dig, from bed to bed, the muse's garden. Teach ye to cry, to-day—to-morrow twitter; 'Twixt two such sweet extremes—farewel all bitter.— Restor'd to favour,—and no more a fibber, Lord! what new dev'l (they'll cry) has mottled Cibber? But, we'll be serious—'Tis nor worse, nor better, I'm in my country's case—a deep-dipt debtor!— Is that a crime, too black to hope your pity? Ah! tell me—camp, fleet, country, court, and city. —Nay, there's a King, God bless him! who, they say, Owes—more than any king, but he, can pay. Owes, to his maker—ev'ry lov'd attraction, That awes rebellion, and disgraces faction. Owes to his people—(what they fly to lend him) Millions of hearts, and hands, that all befriend him.— Owes, to himself—contempt of fears below him.— Owes mercy, to his foes—because they show him. Paraphrase on the third Chapter of Habakuk. God of my fathers! stretch thy oft-try'd hand, And yet, once more, redeem thy chosen land: Once more, by wonders, make thy glories known, And, 'midst thy anger, be thy mercy shown! O! I have heard thy dreadful actions told, And my soul burns thy terrors to unfold. At Israel's call, the' almighty's thunder hurl'd, From Paran's summit, shook th'astonish'd world; The flaming heav'ns blaze, dreadful, through the sky, And earth's dark regions gleam, beneath his eye. High, in his undetermin'd hands, he bore Judgment's heap'd horn, and mercy's struggling store; Meagre, before him, Death, pale horror! trod, And, grinning shadowy, watch'd the almighty nod: Gath'ring, beneath his feet flash'd lightnings broke, And the aw'd mountain shook, conceal'd in smoke. He stood; and, while the measur'd earth he ey'd, The starting nations dropt their conscious pride; High-boasting Cushan struck her tents, in shame, And Midian groan'd, beneath repented fame. He mov'd; and, from their old foundations rent, The everlasting hills, before him, bent; He stept; and all th' uprising mountains stray, And roll, in earthquakes, to escape his way: From their enormous chasms, with roaring tide, Earth-cleaving rivers spout, and deluge wide: The sea, alarm'd, climb'd fast, its god to spy, And, in outragious triumph, swept the sky. Conscious of wrath divine, the sun grew pale, And, o'er his radiance, drew a gloomy veil. Thus did my God (to save th' endanger'd land) March forth, indignant, with vindictive hand; This, when I hear, chill blasts my soul o'erspread, And my lips quiver, with the rising dread: Trembling all o'er, my limbs I faintly draw, And my bones crumble, with ideal awe. Now, tho' the fig-tree ne'er should blossom yield, Tho' sterile coldness curse th'unrip'ning field; Tho' vines, and olives, fail their loady chear, Nor fainting herds out-live the pining year; Yet, shall my soul, in God's sure aid, rejoice, And earth's high sov'reign claim my heav'n-tun'd voice. The Muse's Expostulation, with a Lady, who denied herself the Freedom of Friendship, from too delicate an Apprehension of the World's mistaken Censure. O born to pity woes, yet, form'd to give, Shut from whose presence, 'twere a pain, to live! Who make all converse tedious, but your own; And, that with-held, leave the forsaken none. Urg'd by what motives, would you wish to shun The sight, and voice, of him, whose soul you won? On what false fears does this cold flight depend? What fancy'd foe does prudence apprehend? When bodies only are to bodies dear, The danger there consists in being near; And, when the fair, the soft contagion spy, Discretion calls 'em—and 'tis wise, to fly. But, where associate spirits catch the flame, Flight is a cruel, and a fruitless aim. Souls have no sexes; and if minds agree, Parting is dying, to set fancy free. Nor let mistaken virtue wrong the breast, That opens kindly to so sweet a guest: Not saints, in heav'n a purer warmth express, Than reason feels, when touch'd by tenderness. Relenting wisdom dignifies desire, And rais'd ideas fan the bright'ning fire; 'Till the white flame, ascending to the sky, Spreads its low smoak, in envy's darken'd eye. Whence grew society, so wish'd an art, If the mind's elegance betrays the heart? Were it a crime in flashing souls, to rise, And strike each other thro' the meeting eyes; Those op'ning windows had not let in light, Nor stream'd ideas out, to voice the sight. Why are you form'd so pow'rful, in your charms, If beauty ought to fly the wish, it warms? Vainly did heav'n inspire that tuneful tongue, With notes more sweet, than ever seraph sung! If, justly, all that harmony you hide, Your musick useless, and its pow'r un-try'd. Have wit and eloquence in vain, conspir'd, And giv'n you brightness, but to shine retir'd? Must you be loveliest, yet be never shown? Than all be wiser, yet be heard, by none? Oh! 'tis too delicate!—'tis falsely nice, To bar the heart against the mind's advice. But, you will say, that honour's call, you hear; That fame is tender—reputation, dear: That, from the world's malignant blast you fly, Fear the fool's tongue, and the discerner's eye. The spleen of disappointed wishes dread, Or envy's whispers, by detraction spread? Alas! what bounds can limit your retreat? Where will sought safety rest your flying feet? Is there a corner, in the globe, so new, That malice will not find, as sure as you? The very flight, that shuns, attracts the wrong; And ev'ry censure fear'd, you force along. “There's cause, no doubt, for her retreat, they'll “say, “A fearless innocence had dar'd to stay! Scandal has, either way, an edge, to strike, And wounds distinction every where alike: Superior excellence is doom'd, to bear The stings of sland'rous hate, and rash despair: 'Tis the due tax, your rated merit pays, And ev'ry judging ear will call it praise. Think—and be kind—convert this fruitless pain, To a fix'd firmness, and a calm disdain. Since cautious absence can no more be free, From false reproach, than present smiles will be, Diffuse those gifts, which heav'n design'd should bless, Nor let their greatness make their pity less. Indulging freedom, ev'ry fear disarm, And, with a conscious scorn of slander, charm. Bold, in your guarded strength, your heart unbind, And, to be safe—suppose yourself all mind. Yet, needless that! since such respect you draw, That ev'n your tenderness is arm'd with awe: Permitted love, would silently admire, And a soft rev'rence tremble, thro' desire. The warmest wishes, when inspir'd by you, Strike, but as heav'nly inspirations do. The op'ning heart makes room for joys refin'd, And ev'ry gross idea shrinks behind. You need not then, the gentle sound reject, Shou'd Love's fear'd name be giv'n to soft respect: When ill-distinguish'd meanings are the same, How poor the diff'rence, which they draw from name! There are, in love, th' extremes of touch'd desire, The noblest brightness, or the coarsest fire! In vulgar bosoms, vulgar wishes move; Nature guides choice, and as men think, they love. But, when a pow'r, like yours, impels the wound, Like the clear cause, the bright effect is found. In the loose passion, men profane the name, Mistake the purpose, and pollute the flame: In nobler bosoms, friendship's form it takes, And sex alone, the lovely diff'rence makes. Love's generous warmth does reason's pow'r display, And fills desire, as light embodies day. Love is, to life, what colour is, to form: Plain drawings oft are just, but never warm. Love, in a blaze of tints, his light'ning throws; Then the form quickens, and the figure glows. An Epigram, occasion'd by some Verses, on a Monument, in Westminster Abbey. How lost this pomp of verse! how vain the hope, That thought can dwell on Craigs, in view of Pope! When, upon Rubicon's fam'd bank is shown Cæsar's press'd foot, on the remember'd stone; No traveller once asks the quarry's name, Whence the coarse grit, by chance distinguish'd came; But thinks, with rev'rence, here great Julius trod, And hails the footstep of a Roman God! To Mrs. L?r, playing on a Bass-Viol. While, o'er the dancing chords, your fingers fly, And bid them live, 'till they have made us die; Trembling, in transport, at your touch, they spring, As if there dwelt a heart, in every string. Your voice, soft rising, thro' the lengthen'd notes, The marry'd harmony, united, floats; Two charms, so join'd, that they compose but one; Like heat and brightness, from the self-same sun. The wishful viol would its wealth retain, And, sweetly conscious, hugs the pleasing pain; Envious, forbids the warbling joys to roll, And, murm'ring inward, swells its sounding soul. Proud of its charming pow'r, your tuneful bow Floats o'er the chords majestically slow; Careless, and soft, calls out a tide of art, And, in a storm of musick, drowns the heart. So, when that God, who gave you all your skill, To angel forms (like yours) entrusts his will, Calm, they descend, some new-meant world to found, And, smiling, see creation rising round! On a Lady, preach'd into the Cholic, by one of her Lovers. Bellona the fierce, who held man in disdain, And despis'd her own sex, to whom love cou'd give pain; Went to church, in defyance, and met with her fate, From a pulpited Cupid, who there lay in wait: But her head was so arm'd, and so hard was her heart, That his arrows rebounded, in scorn of his art, Then, with voice of revenge, he exalted his pipes, Shot in spleen at her belly, and gave her the gripes. Thus I wound her, cry'd he, in a whimsical place, 'Cause she covers kind wishes, with haughty grimace. Let her now twist and skrew—'twill but fasten the dart; She has love in her bowels, tho' she hates in her heart. To a Lady, with a Book return'd, call'd The Intelligencer. I Have kept your Intelligence, Madam, so long, That I hardly dare hope, you will pardon the wrong. Had you been but a man, no excuse I had writ, For we're seldom severe to the faults, we commit; But intelligence kept, the kind ladies must gall, Who no sooner receive it, than part with it all. The CHANGE; To the Lovely Cause of it. Sweet enslaver! can you tell, E're I learnt to love so well, How my hours had wings to move, All unbusied by my love! 'Tis amazement, now, to me, What could then a pleasure be! But you, like God, new sense can give, And now, indeed, I feel, I live, Oh! what pangs his breast alarm, Whom soul and body, join, to charm! Endless transports dance along, Sweetly soft! or nobly strong! Flaming fancy! cool reflection! Fierce desire! and aw'd subjection! Aking hope! and fear encreasing! Struggling passions, never ceasing! Wishing! trembling! soul-adoring! Ever blest, and still imploring. Let the dull, the cold, and tame, All those dear disorders blame; Tell 'em, that, in honour's race, Charm'd by some such heav'nly face, Lovers always foremost ran; Love's a second soul to man. Ease is languid, low, and base; Love excites a generous chase: Glory! Wealth! Ambition! Wit! Thoughts, for boundless empire, fit! All, at Love's approach are fir'd, Bent more strong, and never tir'd, He who feels not Love's sweet pain, Lives at ease—but lives in vain! Little dream you, what is due, Angel form! to Love, and you! 'Tis from you, I joy possess! 'Tis by you, my grief grows less! Sadly pensive, when alone, I the shades of life bemoan; If some voice your name impart, Care lies lighten'd, at my heart; Ev'ry woe disarms its sting, And I look down on Britain's king! When my fancy brings to view Works, which wealth and pow'r can do; All my spurr'd excitements wake, And fortune charms me, for your sake! Oh! I cry—'twere heav'n possest! To make her great, who made me blest. In the morning, when I rise, If the sun-shine strikes my eyes, All that pleases, in his view, Is, my hope, to look on you! When the sable sweep of night Drowns distinction, from my sight, I no inward darkness find; You are day-light to my mind! All my dreams are lives of joy, Which, in waking, I destroy: You, a slave to custom made, Are of forms, and rules, afraid: But your happier image, free From fantastic tyranny; Independent, kind, and wise, Scorns restraint, and knows no ties. Oh! the dear, the racking pain; Who that sleeps thus, wou'd wake again! A SONG. [Oh! forbear to bid me slight her] I Oh! forbear to bid me slight her, Soul and senses, take her part; Could my death itself delight her, Life should leap, to leave my heart. Strong, though soft, a lover's chain, Charm'd with woe, and pleas'd with pain. II Tho' the tender flame were dying, Love would light it, at her eyes; Or, her tuneful voice applying, Thro' my ear, my soul surprize. Deaf, I see the fate, I shun; Blind, I hear, I am undone, A SONG. [Now ponder well, ye husbands dear] Now ponder well, ye husbands dear, The fate of wives, too bright; A woeful cause you have to fear, Their day will turn to night. At first all gay, and rais'd with joy, They charm the poor man's heart; With smiling eyes, they sport, and toy, And gild the nuptial dart. But ah! too soon, they quench their fire; (Alas! good hearer, weep!) Then gape, and stretch, and yawn, and tire, And hum their souls to sleep! On the March of the Russian Auxiliaries, in 1748. Long look'd-for comes at last.—Th' unfreezing pole Beaks her bald eagle, and awakes to soul! O'er trackless wilds, with snow-surmounting feet, Roads to bought blows, the furry veteransbeat; But arm'd for stipend, not allied, but paid, The moving market, sells its martial aid. So modern prudence, waging war by tale, O'er sense of praise bids sense of price prevail; Nor fame, nor faith, nor vengeance, move supply, For glorious subsidy we live, and die. Bribes battling bribes, embroil each bleeding coast, And he, who buys his valour, triumphs most. O! soul of Peter! now sustain thy fame; No venal muster mock'd thy dreaded name; From death's dark hall, to days dimm'd prospect rise, O'er thy chang'd country roll thy guardian eyes. Round the slow legions, gleam thy aweful shade, With Dantzic's bloody banners, high display'd: March 'em to meet French fire, there, quench'd before, And tread it out, in blood, to blaze no more. Hint from some old Verses, on a Stone, in Stepney Church-wall. Two thousand years, e'er Stepney had a name, In Carthage walls, I shar'd the punic fame; There, to the strongest, added strength I lent, And proudly propp'd the world's best ornament. Now, to cold Britain, a torn transport, thrown, I piece a church-yard pile, unmark'd, unknown: Stain'd, and half sunk in dirt, my sculpture lies, And moulders, like the graves, which round me rise. Oh! think, blind mortals! what frail dust, you claim, And laugh at wealth, wit, beauty, pow'r, and fame! Short praise, can fleeting hopes, like yours, supply, Since times, and tongues, and tow'rs, and empires die! On Clio's Birth-day. O'er the blue violet, while the amorous wind Bends, and perfumes his wings, to fan this day; Why has pale sickness winter'd o'er my mind, And, with chill agues, check'd the warmth of May? Is it not Clio's birth-day?—Toil of thought! Height, beyond all, that e'er ambition trod. Sum of refin'd desire! by angels taught, To look, and think, and act, a female god! Oh! my rapt soul, sits trembling in my eyes, Starting, impatient, at her pow'rful name: Dearer, than life, to that sweet sound it flies, And health rides rosy, on the living flame. Wak'd into sudden strength, I blaze again, Love, the restorer, dress'd in Clio's smile, Triumph'd o'er nature, gave delight to pain, Sweeten'd affliction, and could death beguile. May joys un-number'd, as the charmer's sweets, Bless this revolving day's eternal round; 'Till the proud world its dawn, with rapture greets, Conscious of her, who made it first renown'd. Long—let 'em say—long, e're our father's days, Three thousand years ago, on this sweet day, That Clio, whom contending nations praise, Embloom'd, by her sweet birth, the first of May. Britain, illustrious by the starry lot, Far, in the north, distinguish'd island, lies, Now known by later names—oh, envy'd spot! Why did she not in our warm climates rise? Sure, she was heav'nly grac'd! for, to this hour, After such length of ages roll'd away! Fame of her charms, augments her sex's pow'r, And her thought's lustre gives our wits their sway. To a Lady, desiring her Letters might not be exposed. No! thou best soul, that e'er this body knew, Unhappy I may be, but not untrue! Blest, or unblest, my love can ne'er decay, Nor could I, where I could not love, betray. Cold, and unjust, the shocking caution kills, And, in one meaning, spots me o'er with ills. Silent, as sacred lamps, in bury'd urns, The conscious flame of lovers inward burns: Life should be torn, and racks be stretch'd in vain, And vary'd tortures tire their fruitless pain, E're but a thought of mine shou'd do thee wrong, Or spread thy beauties on the public tongue. Yet, thou can'st fear me—oh! be lost the shame, Nor heap dishonour on my future name! Have I been never lov'd?—yet, cruel, tell, Whom I betray'd to thee, tho' lov'd so well? Take thy sweet mischiefs back, their charms erase, Oh! leave me poor, but never think me base. Not e'en, when death shall veil thy starry eyes, Shall thy dear letters, from my ashes, rise; Fix'd to my heart, the grave shall give 'em room To charm my waking soul, in worlds to come. While in my verse, with far more faint essay, Thy wonders, I to after times convey; Tell thy vast heav'n of sweets, and sing thy name, 'Till fir'd by thee, whole kingdoms catch thy flame. Epitaph, on Sir Isaac Newton. More than his Name were less.—'Twou'd seem, to fear, He, who increas'd Heav'n's fame, could want it here. Yet, when the Suns, he lighted up, shall fade, And all the Worlds, he found, are first decay'd; Then, void, and waste, Eternity shall lie, And Time, and Newton's Name, together die. To Mr. Dyer; on his attempting Clio's Picture. Soul of your honour'd art! what man can do, In copying nature, may be reach'd by you: Your peopling pencil a new world can give, And, like Deucalion, teach the stones to live. From your creating hand, a war may flow; And your warm strokes, with breathing action, glow: But, from that angel form, to catch the grace, And kindle up your ivory, with her face. All, unconsum'd, to snatch the living fire, And limn th' ideas, which those eyes inspire; Strong, to your burning circle, to confine That awe-mix'd sweetness, and that air divine; That sparkling soul, which lightens, from within! And breaks, in unspoke meanings, thro' her skin. This, if you can—hard task l and yet unprov'd! Then, shall you be adorn'd, as now belov'd. Then, shall your high-aspiring colours find The art, to picture thought, and paint the wind. Then, shall you give air shape, imprison space, And mount the painter to the maker's place. Whitehall Stairs. From Whitehall Stairs, whence oft, with distant view, I've gaz'd whole moon-shine hours, on hours away, Blest but to see those roofs, which cover'd you, And watch'd beneath what star, you sleeping, lay. Launch'd on the smiling stream, which felt my hope, And danc'd, and quiver'd, round my gliding boat, I came, this day, to give my tongue free scope, And vent the passion, which my looks denote. To tell my dear, my soul-disturbing muse, (But that's a name, can speak but half her charms) How my full heart does my pen's aid refuse, And bids my voice describe my soul's alarms. To tell what transports your last letter gave, What heav'ns were open'd, in your soft complaint, To tell!—what pride I take, to be your slave, And how triumphant love disdains restraint. But, when I miss'd you, and took boat again, The sympathetic sun condol'd my woe; Drew in his beams, to mourn my pity'd pain, And bid the shadow'd stream benighted flow. Sudden, the weeping skies unsluic'd their store, And torrents of big tears unceasing shed; Sad, I drove downward, to a flooded shore, And, disappointed, hung my dripping head. Landed, at length, I sable coffee drink, And, ill surrounded, by a noisy tribe, Scornful of what they do, or say, or think, I, rapt in your dear heav'n, my loss describe. To the same. Yes—now 'tis time to die—despair comes on; Who keeps the body, when the soul is gone? She sets—fair light, that shew'd me all my joy, And, like the sun's, her absence must destroy. She, who once wept my fancyd loss of breath, Now, crimeless murd'rer! gives me real death. Yet, have a care, touch'd heart, nor sigh one thought, That stains such goodness with a purpos'd fault. Soft, as her tears, her gentle meanings move; Her soul sheds sweetness, tho' her look is love. Her voice is musick, tun'd to heav'n's low note; Her touch bids transport, thro' each art'ry, float; Her step is dignity, by pity checkt; At once, she fans desire, and plants respect. Unconscious of her charms, she dreams of none, And doubling other's praises, shuns her own. Modest, in pow'r, as kneeling angels pray, Noiseless, as night's soft shade, tho' bright, as day. Wise, unassumingly; serenely deep, Easy as air, and innocent, as sleep: Blooming, like beauty when adorn'd for sin, Yet, like the bud, unblown, all blush within. O! 'tis impossible, to quit such bliss, Yet live, superior to a loss, like this! Where will she, next, her thousand conquests make? On what new climate will her sun-shine break? Where will she next, (sweet tasker of my care!) Teach our charm'd sex, to hope, to wish, to dare? Far from her fruitless guardian's watchful eye, What may she hear! what answer! oh! I'll die. Bless'd by her sight—time's race were one short stage; She gone—one widow'd moment were an age. A SONG. [Clio! smiling, soul-invader!] Clio! smiling, soul-invader! Soft amuser of my days, Be my silent passion's aider, Teach my tongue, to speak thy praise. Thou, like heroes, scarr'd all over, Wanting room, to suffer more; Pil'd with praise, canst hear no lover Tell thee ought, untold before. Truth, with modest bounds, contented, Rightly praising thee, must say, More than falsehood e'er invented, When she widest went astray. Writ on a blank Leaf of an obscene Poem. The sacred nine, first, spread their golden wings, In praise of virtue, heroes, and of kings: Chast were their lays, and ev'ry verse design'd, To soften nature, and exalt the mind. Loosely the moderns live, and loosely write, And woo their muse, as Mistress, for delight. Thick, in their lays, obscenities abound, As weeds spring plenteous, in the rankest ground: All, who write verse, to taint a guiltless heart, Are vile profaners of the sacred art. Cloy'd, the sick reader from the work retires, And, e're the writer dies, his fame expires. To Mrs. T?t. Where, in this land, (Alzira cry'd) Shall Indian virtues rest? Who will be, here, the stranger's guide, And lead her to be blest? Seek, said the whisp'ring muse, some fair, Of England's beauteous race: Who does, herself, those virtues share, Which most Alzira grace. One, who has taste, as nobly strong, And charms, as softly sweet; Will guard her sister soul from wrong, While graces, graces meet. I took the muse's kind advice, Look'd round the fair and bright, And found Alzira, in a trice, Was matchless T?t's right. To a Lady, who put herself into a bad way, by taking Spirit of Nitre, by Spoon-fulls, instead of a few Drops. Oh, beware of excess—'tis an error in life, Into which one would wonder, a wit should be slipping; What a schism, in an orthodox clergyman's wife, When we talk of baptizing, to think we mean dipping! Were your love but as much over-dos'd, as your drops, You would leave Mr. Forster no lip-room, for pray'rs; And complaint, from his parish, wou'd come, thick as hops, 'Gainst engrossing a breath, in which others have shares. Both the sexes assert, and the whole world agrees, That too much of what's good, is scarce better than ill, Tho' the ladies have pow'r, to decree what they please, And have got an exception put in for Quadrille. He, who likes what you say, by your sprightliness, warm'd, Shou'd you still, without stopping, run on, to say more, Wou'd be vex'd, to perceive himself more and more charm'd, E're allow'd to declare, how you charm'd him before. There's a medium, in all things, as when Mrs. Raikes Has, for ten hours together, her Cynic alarm'd; Prudence, parting 'em, timely, for both their dear sakes, Keeps 'em free from the danger of being uncharm'd. So, a few drops of Nitre, dispos'd to ascend, Has arriv'd at your head, nor been taken, in vain; But the weight of so many—only serv'd a wrong end, And, mistaking the place, double-pointed the pain. A SONG. [O Celia! be wary, when Celadon sues] I O Celia! be wary, when Celadon sues, These wits are the bane of your charms: Beauty play'd against reason, will certainly lose, Warring, naked, with robbers, in arms. II Young Damon, despis'd, for his plainness of parts, Has worth, that a woman should prize; He'll run the race out, tho' he heavily starts, And distance the short-winded wise. III The fool is a saint, in the temple of Love, And kneels all his life, there, to pray: The wit but looks in, and makes haste, to remove, 'Tis a stage, he but takes, in his way. The Reconciliation. Sick of a worthless world, and courting rest, My sullen soul, with pensive weight, opprest; Disturb'd, and mournful, sought the silent shade, And fed reflection, in the breezy glade. Stretch'd on the grassy margent of a brook, Whose murm'ring fellowship my mind partook; Actively idle, I, repining, lay, Gaz'd on the flood, and sigh'd the stream away. Who knows, I cry'd, what course thou hast to pass, Sweet stream, that now creepst softly through this grass? How wilt thou flow!—Anon, perhaps, slid hence, Thy deep'ning channel fills some moated fence, Hems in some farm, where homely rusticks meet, And their sweet bread, prize of hard labour, eat. Thence, thro' some lord's delightful garden, led, Thou may'st thy vegetative influence spread; Where, as thro' fragrant beds, thy purlings slide, The grateful flow'rs shall kiss 'em, as they glide: There, charm'd, and ling'ring, thou may'st wish to stay, And, hoarsely murm'ring, roll, displeas'd, away. But, while, with careless pace, thou journey'st slow, Oft halting, to look back, at this fair show, Some precipice, that, in close ambush, lies, Thy virgin current shall, at once, surprize, Cross whose broad shoulders thrown, and tumbling o'er, Thy frighted stream shall rush, with unavailing roar. Next, may thy silver current's brightness die, And muddily, some stagnate fen supply; Where shadow'd reeds, in thy slow stream, shall shake, And floods fly, trembling, from the gloom, they make: Frighted, and glad to 'scape this horrid place, Thou may'st wind short, and new-direct thy race, Through verdant meads, o'erjoy'd may'st, dancing, go, 'Till cattle sip thy whirlpools, as they flow: Thence, for protection of thy ruffled charms, Thou may'st rush swift, to some great lover's arms; Some stately stream, by keely courtship prest, And mark'd, with wealth's proud furrows, on his breast: Grave Thames may, next, receive thy mix'd embrace, And fam'd Augusta see thy sully'd face; From her wash'd foot, thy scatter'd flood may stray, And, to the swallowing ocean, roll away: There, wasted stream! in wind-driv'n billows tost, Thy oft-chang'd being shall be wholly lost. So, gentle brook, I cry'd, does human life, 'Midst endless changes, and in endless strife, Glide, with impatience, thro' unknown events, 'Till nature asks repose, and death consents. Why then is such a life so much desir'd? By what pursuits, is vain ambition fir'd? Friendship is lost, on earth; love goes astray; And men, like beasts, each on the other prey: Ev'n the soft sex their downy bosoms hide, With inward artifice, or outward pride. Beauty's spoil'd shafts no more the soul can hit, Dull'd, by gross folly, or misguided wit. Nothing is, now, worth wishing for, on earth, And death is grown a much less woe, than birth. While thus I mourn'd—back roll'd th' astonish'd brook, The trees bow'd down, the earth, beneath me, shook! All heav'n descended to the glowing ground, And radiant terror, dazzling, shone around: Blind, with the strong refulgence, fix'd, I lay, Bury'd, in brightness, and o'erwhelm'd, with day. Listen, a sound broke out—impatient youth! Listen, and mark the voice of sacred truth. Rouz'd, at that name, I would have bless'd my sight, But strove, in vain, to stem the tide of light; Still, as I rais'd my eyes, their balls struck fire, And wat'ry gushings wept the rash desire: The unseen phantom's voice, sudden, and loud, Startled the ear, as thunder rends a cloud; But soft'ning more and more, grew sweet, and kind, And dy'd away, like musick, in the wind: I come, continues she, to bring thee peace, To bid thy diffidence, in friendship cease; Again, to reconcile thee to mankind, New-wing thy transports, and un-clog thy mind; To guide thy wand'ring choice, to find that joy, Distrust of which, does thy sad hours employ: There lives a charmer, whom, divinely fir'd, E'en her whole sex's virtues have inspir'd; Where all that's manly, joins with all that's sweet, And, in whose breast, engross'd perfections meet; Her mind no conscious pride of merit stains; O'er her wide soul, unsully'd reason reigns: Blind to her worth, she feels not her own flame, Enriches merit, yet despises fame. Her unaffected charms, what words can paint? She looks an angel, and she speaks a saint! While sparkling gayness, wantons in her eye, In her wise soul, the laughing Cupids die. A thousand graces round her person play, And all the muses mark her fancy's way: To hear her speak, the soul, with rapture fills, Her looks alarm—but, when she writes, she kills. Rise, then, and meet her, as she this way strays, And thy own wonder shall out-speak my praise. The goddess vanish'd to her native skies, And the recover'd shade unbarr'd my eyes; I look'd, and lo! within the honour'd wood, Lovely Cleora, hid, in bay-leaves, stood; Cleora—but her wonders to reveal, Were to describe, what I can only feel! Now, reconcil'd to the shun'd world, I'll live: Her friendship—joys, worth living for, can give. On the Birth-day of Miss ? I Care, be banish'd far away— Fly, be gone, approach not here: Mirth, and joy, demand this day, Happiest day of all the year! II Summers, three times sev'n have shone, All out-shin'd, by Delia's eyes: Winters, three times sev'n, are gone, All whose snows, her breast supplies! III Dance we, then, the chearful round, Musick might have stay'd away; She but speaking, organs sound: She but smiling, angels play. IV 'Tis her birth-day—let it blaze! Born to charm, and form'd for bliss: Live she lov'd, a world of days, Ev'ry day, as bless'd, as this, V Let her beauty—not increase; Too, too strong, already, there! But, let heav'n augment her peace, 'Till she's happy, as she's fair. The GLOVE. Tell me, sweet glove! what name the charmer bears, Whose downy hand thy snowy cov'ring wears? 'Tis a dear name, I am forbid to tell, But these distinguish'd marks may paint her well: She's gently aweful, winningly severe, Charms, when she speaks, yet rather loves, to hear; Wise, as a god; as fancy'd angels, fair; Lovely, as light, and soft, as upper air. Enough, sweet glove! by this plain picture, taught, H?e, I find, is the dear name, I sought. Ronald and Dorna; by a Highlander, to his Mistress. From a literal Translation of the Original. I Come, let us climb Skorr-urran's snowy top; Cold, as it seems, it is less cold, than you: Thin, thro' its snow, these lambs its heath-twigs crop; Your snow, more hostile, starves, and freezes, too. II What, tho' I lov'd, of late, in Skey's fair isle! And blush'd—and bow'd—and shrunk from Kenza's eye! All, she had power to hurt with, was her smile; But 'tis a frown of yours, for which I die. III Ask, why these herds, beneath us, rush, so fast, On the brown sea-ware's stranded heaps, to feed? Winter, like you, with-holds their wish'd repast, And, robb'd of genial grass, they brouze on weed. IV Mark, with what tuneful haste Sheleila flows, To mix its wid'ning stream, in Donnan's lake! Yet, should some dam the current's course oppose, It must, per-force, a less-lov'd passage take. V Born, like your body, for a spirit's claim, Trembling, I wait, unsoul'd, 'till you inspire: God has prepar'd the lamp, and bids it flame, But you, fair Dorna, have with-held the fire. VI High, as yon pine, when you begin to speak, My light'ning heart leaps, hopeful, at the sound, But, fainting at the sense, falls, void, and weak, And sinks, and saddens, like yon mossy ground. VII All that I taste, or touch, or see, or hear, Nature's whole breadth reminds me but of you! Ev'n heav'n itself would your sweet likeness wear, If, with its pow'r, you had its mercy, too. Writ on a blank Leaf of Merope; sent to Mr. Garrick, by the Author. To the never-equall'd Actor of Eumenes. Into your hands, a dumb dead likeness take, Whose form you quicken'd, and whose soul you make. Mine was a painted fire—your piercing rays Lent light'ning; and effulg'd it into blaze. Now, on a shelf, some silent nook impart To him, you've loudly lodg'd on ev'ry heart. EPIGRAM. In antient times, when honour bore the bell, And people blush'd not, at their doing well; Where, crush'd, beneath triumphant envy's weight, The hand of valour wore the chain of state; There did the daring muse devote her rhymes, And grateful verse condemn'd ungrateful crimes. But, in our more improv'd, and bart'ring days, There's a price currant stampt on poet's praise; The workman strikes but as his labour's paid, And heroes rise and fall, like stocks in trade. Abstract from Psalm cxiv. When, from proud Egypt's hard and cruel hand, High-summon'd Israel sought the promis'd land, The opening sea divided, at her call, And refluent Jordan rose, a wat'ry wall! Light, as met lambs, the starting hills leapt wide, And the slow mountains roll'd themselves aside! Why, O thou sea! did thy vast depth divide? And why, O Jordan! fled thy back'ning tide? Why leapt your lines, ye frighted hills, astray? And what, O mountains! rent your roots away? Hark! I will tell—proud earth confess'd her God, And mark'd his wond'rous foot-steps, as he trod. While bent to bless, He chear'd his thirsty flock, And, into floods of liquid length, dissolv'd the loosening rock. The Singing-Bird. I Pope, in absence of his pain, Easy, negligent, and gay, With the fair, in am'rous vein, Lively, as the smiling day, Talk'd, and toy'd, the hours away. II Tuneful, o'er Belinda's chair, Finely cag'd, a Linnet hung; Breath'd its little soul in air, Flutt'ring round its mansion sprung; And its carrols sweetly sung. III Winding, from the fair one's eye, On her feather'd slave, to gaze; Meant, cry'd Pope, to wing the sky, Yet, a captive, all thy days, How dost thou this musick raise! IV Since, a prisoner, thou can'st sing, Sportive, airy, wanton, here, Hadst thou liberty of wing, How thy melody would chear! How transport the list'ning ear! V No, reply'd the warbling song. Rais'd—articulate, and clear! Now, to wish me free, were wrong; Loftier, in my native sphere, But, with fewer friends, than here. VI Tho' with grief, my fate you see, Many a poet's is the same; Aw'd, secluded, and unfree, Humble avarice of fame, Keeps 'em fetter'd, own'd, and tame. VII To our feeders, they, and I, Lend our lives, in narrow bound; Perch'd, within our owner's eye, Gay, we hop, the gilded round, Changing, neither note, nor ground. VIII For, should freedom break our chain, Tho' the self-dependent flight Would, to heav'n exalt our strain; Yet, unheard, and out of sight, All our praise were forfeit, by't. To the un-declared Author of the Poem, call'd Patriotic Love. I When Jacob's muse re-strings the slacken'd lyre, And, sweetly pensive, sounds the meaning strain, Why does his fruitless modesty, in vain, Conceal his name, yet, not conceal his fire: Since sentiments alone the soul explain, Keep your thoughts hid, or think not you retire. II Rare, and soon-mark'd, in this receiving age, Strait, to its spring, unvenal verse is trac'd; Its course far shining, tho' its banks defac'd! 'Twas needless to subscribe the speaking page, Unpension'd eminence, and worth mis-plac'd, Point the dumb actor out, to shame the stage. III Go on, un-fainting, tread the pathless way; Nobly redeem the poet's forfeit name; Guide pow'r to virtue, fan the patriot flame: Love of your country doubly, thus, display: Since he, by whom the great more greatly aim, In reason's reck'ning, is more great, than they. IV O! would but fortune crown your muse's pray'r; Wou'd list'ning angels, to your patron's heart, Convey your love of each unfriended art, What length of glory would you jointly, share! He, to your genius, pow'r, would soon impart, And you endear his pow'r, by patriot care. A SONG. [Gentle Love, this hour befriend me] I Gentle Love, this hour befriend me, To my eyes, resign thy dart; Notes of melting musick lend me, To dissolve a frozen heart. II Chill, as mountain snow, her bosom! Tho' I tender language use, 'Tis, by cold indiff'rence, frozen, To my arms, and to my muse. III See! my dying eyes are pleading, Where a breaking heart appears: For thy pity interceding, With the eloquence of tears. IV While the lamp of life is fading, And, beneath thy coldness, dies, Death, my ebbing pulse invading, Take my soul into thy eyes. My Soul's last Sighs, to the divine L?r?a. Let plaintive thoughts, in mournful numbers, flow, Prose is too dull, for love, too calm for woe! Has she not bid thee quit thy faithful flame! Sell her, and truth, for Equipage, and Name? Nay, she has bid thee go—Whence this delay? Whence this fond, fruitless, ling'ring wish, to stay? L?a bids thee go—she, who, alone, Makes all life's future blessings, means thee none! Begone, then—let thy struggling heart obey, And in long distance, sigh sad life away. Still, still, vain, flatt'ring hope misleads desire. Fed, by faint glimm'ring shoots of glow-worm fire. What, tho' she sweetly writes, to ease thy grief, Or points kind comfort, by the folded leaf: Such pity must thy grateful rev'rence move, But judge it right—nor think compassion, love. What tho' each word she marks, like Spring's soft show'rs, Flows sweet, as new-blown breath of op'ning flow'rs, Such borrow'd sounds she need not have apply'd, Her own, more tuneful, thou too oft, hast try'd: To speak, in musick, ever was her claim, And all grows harmony, that bears her name. Had'st thou e'er touch'd her heart, with one soft pain, And, bless'd, in loving, been belov'd again; All her cold reasoning doubts had ceas'd to move, And her whole gen'rous breast conceiv'd but love. She, who believes not, loves not—Feel thy fate: Friendship, from her, pains more than other's hate. All the kind passions, wanting one, she'll own, But, that one wanting, all the rest are none. Would love, and she, disperse the threat'ning storm, Let her believe, and trust, and break thro' form; Let her command thy stay, to know success, Nor fear the god-like attribute, to bless: Born, to distinguish her, from womankind, To court her converse, and to taste her mind; Fram'd, for her empire, with her image, fill'd, Charm'd by her form, and, in her temper, skill'd; Piercing her tim'rous heart's most secret thought, And knowing, and adoring, each dear fault, How art thou pain'd—to find her soft'ning will, Held, against love, by ev'ry guard of skill! How art thou doom'd, to lengths of ope'ning woe, Should she feel love—yet, fear, to tell thee so? If she distrusts thy truth—all hope must fall, Doubting her pow'r, she disbelieves thee all. And none, who doubts her lover, dares to love. Go, then—to climes, cold, as her heart, remove; A distant fate thy gloomy choice prefers, Present, thou can'st not live, and not live hers. Farewell, kind, cautious, unresolving, fair! To hear thee bless'd, will charm amidst despair. 'Tis death, to go—'tis more, than death, to stay, Rest will be soonest reach'd, the first dark way. Ne'er may'st thou know a pain! still chearful be, Nor check life's comforts, with one thought of me. Pallas's Whisper, in a Dream, to two Beauties, at Eltham. Expell'd th' assembly! 'twas discreetly done! Could the torch shine, but where it miss'd the sun? Wisely, the old and ugly, shun compare, Nor prune their with'ring barks, against the fair! You gone, they glean a cold respect, undue, But drop their plunder'd sheaves, at sight of you. So, the shock'd Indian, conscious of his face, Broke the bright glass, to hide his own disgrace. Smile, un-revengeful, leave their pride forlorn, And mix some pity, with the public scorn. 'Twere hard, to clip the starver's stinted shares, No—let the balm of envy still be theirs. Leave 'em the needful pow'r, to hate their bane, And shun those eyes, by which they wish, in vain. Nature indulg'd a self-defence to all; For that, she gave the dry'd old maid, her gall; For that, long vipers wind their hiss along, And, but for that, th' assembly mourns your wrong. Verses, to the unknown Author of the Rover Reclaim'd; written extempore, at the Rehearsal of that Play. The low-brow'd muse, that gives malignance birth, As oft excites our anger, as our mirth; For gen'rous hearts would, usefully, correct, Nor spare the fault, but still the man respect. Touch'd, by a rev'rence, to the species due, Fain would they laugh, without despising, too. Rash, and by no such soft impressions, aw'd, The scurril witling spreads his joke too broad: Straining at humour, lets discernment fall, And laughs at all, by turns, to laugh with all. Not so, thy guardian scene—whose manlier end Warring, on guilt—would innocence defend: From the false Rover, strips his am'rous art, That his true form may fright the fair one's heart, And rescued beauty be, by one man, drest, In arms of temper'd proof, against the rest. The Loom thus fine, how hadst thou weav'd amiss, To thread coarse laughter, thro' a theme, like this! 'Twere an affront to woman's worth! for here, Not to be grave, were—not to be sincere. Nor, let the taste of fools betray the wise, A cheap applause, before a just, to prize. Oft we approve, where, but to smile we seem; But where we laugh the most, we least esteem. This, the deserving purpose of thy play, Compels a stranger's grateful verse, to say, Who felt the pleasure, thousands soon will feel, And judg'd it mean, that pleasure to conceal. To Mr. James Thompson; on his asking my Advice, to what Patron he should address his Poem, called Winter. Some Beers have noble skill to judge, 'tis true, Yet, no poor prospect bounds the muse's view: Firm, in your native strength, thus greatly shown, Slight such delusive props, and stand alone: Fruitless dependance, oft has prov'd, too late, That greatness dwells not, always, with the Great. Patrons are Nature' nobles, not the State's, And Wit's a title, no broad seal creates: E'en Kings, from whose high source, all honours flow, Are poor, in pow'r, when they would souls bestow. He, who stoops safe, beneath a patron's shade, Shines, like the moon, but by a borrow'd aid: Truth should, unbiass'd, free, and open, steer, Strong, as heav'n's heat, and, as its brightness, clear! Heedless of fortune, then, look down, on state, Balanc'd, within, by merit's conscious weight: Divinely proud, of independent will, Prince of your wishes, live, a sov'reign, still; Oh! swell not, then, the bosoms of the vain, With salse conceit, you their protection gain. Poets, like you, their own protectors stand, Plac'd, above aid, from pride's inferior hand. Time, that devours a lord's un-lasting name, Shall lend her soundless depth, to float your fame: On verse, like yours, no smiles, from pow'r expect, Born, with a worth, that doom'd you to neglect. Yet, would your wit be prais'd—reflect no more, Let the smooth veil of flatt'ry, silk you o'er: Aptly attach'd, the court's soft climate try; Learn your pen's duty, from your patron's eye. Ductile of soul, each pliant purpose wind, And, following int'rest close, leave doubt behind: Then, shall your name strike, loud, the public ear, For, through good fortune, virtue's self shines clear. But, in defiance of our taste—to charm, And fancy's force, with judgment's caution, arm, Disturb, with busy thought, so lull'd an age, And plant strong meanings o'er the peaceful page. Impregnate sound, with sense, teach nature art, And warm ev'n winter, 'till it thaws the heart: How could you, thus, your country's rules transgress, Yet, think of patrons, and presume success! TIDDI DOLL. I What a noise in pit, boxes, and gall'ries, and all, Have you lately heard made, about one Tiddi-dol. Tiddi-dol, honest creature! took none of these airs, 'Till the wars of King Pantomime chang'd his affairs, From a baker of gingerbread, (God bless the trade!) Now the mark of the muse, by our malice's aid. For the great and the small Cry—all, Tiddi-doll—Tiddi-doll, 'Tis Tiddi-dol, Tiddi-doll, all. II All the joke of it rose, from his plume, and fine coat, Which but odly agreed with his shop, and his note. Tho' he sold me my gingerbread, yet, I confess, No proportion was hit, 'twixt his name, and his dress. But, if Actors must all, by proportion, be try'd; Then, alas, for poor Pistol, and Drury beside! Where they sell none at all, Yet bawl, Tiddi-doll—Tiddi-doll, Mere, sham, wooden, Tiddi-dolls all. III When their rope-dancers swung, and their tumblers went round, To convince you where wit, and wise management's found; When, to quicken a compliment, sagely bestow'd, They assur'd their kind boxes, 'twas Taste Alamode. When a whole club of beauties, cry'd out for good sense, Yet coud'nt drive gingerbread management thence. Sure—all Was then Tiddi-doll, Aye, Tiddi-doll, Tiddi-doll all. IV So, 'till chance some expression, more suitable, sends, To describe brother Pistol, and all his good friends. Wou'd you speak of men's heads, that run out of their way, 'Till their own parts the silliest of all, they can play; Wou'd you name folks, that manage a stage, with such skill, That, alike, wit and nonsense, brings grist to their mill, Then, at Drury, go call, And behold Tiddi-doll, 'Tis—all, Tiddi-doll, Tiddi-doll, 'Tis Tiddi-doll, Tiddi-doll, all. A SONG. [Vainly, now, ye strive to charm me] I Vainly, now, ye strive to charm me, All, ye sweets, of blooming May; How can empty sun-shine warm me, While Lotharia keeps away! II Go, ye warbling birds! go, leave me: Shade, ye clouds, the smiling sky: Sweeter notes her voice can give me, Softer sun-shine fills her eye. The Western Paradise. There is, there is, a soft, a peaceful shore! An un-curs'd Eden, still in nature's store! A spring, whence un-imbitter'd pleasures flow! A treasury, of ev'ry thing, but woe! Un-promis'd Canaan! which th' Almighty knew, Too great a blessing for th' unthankful Jew: Thence veil'd her beauties; pre-ordain'd, to grace The destin'd triumphs of a nobler race! On thy sweet plains, where all delights are sure, Men can, by turns, be ev'ry thing, but poor. The doubt-freed miser, here, sleeps void of care, For, who will plunder that, which all may share. In other lands, our toil prepares our meat, Our only labour, here, is—take, and eat. Such various shapes does tempting pleasure wear, That, which to chuse her in, is all our care. A SONG. [Attempt not, dissembler, to move me] Attempt not, dissembler, to move me, 'Tis seldom I alter my mind; Nor ever unjust shall you prove me, Tho' you happen to think me unkind. But, vainly, alas! you discover, The graces, and wit, of your friend; My son is too constant a lover, To suffer his passion to bend. Both beauty, and wit, I lay claim to, And those, to a daughter, can grant; My offspring can boast of the same, too, 'Tis money alone, that we want. Then ask no more questions, good Madam; Put beauty, and wit, in one scale; In another, a gypsy, from Haddam, The last, if she's rich, will prevail. On a Rakish Officer, who writ a very silly Epilogue, in Affront to all Women. When Rakes become reformers, masquerade Must be allowed a most extensive trade: You call the world a stage—you find it so, And well, to play, behind the curtain, know: Mean while, your partners, on the far-fam'd strait, Act hero's sillier parts, and serve the state: Fond of a safer toil, you change the scene, And, not in fields of war, but wit, grow lean: How blest your fortune, in the king's warm pay, That lets your muse her own expence defray! Merit, like yours, unprosp'rous else, might strive, Shine inward, and be too refin'd to thrive. O, Captain! you, who write, with such a grace, What thanks owes woman to your saving face! Were but your eyes as piercing, as your quill, Tho' your sword's idle, yet your looks would kill. A Translation, from some Italian Verses, of Mr. Milton; sent to a Lady, when he was in Florence. When, in your language, I, unskill'd, address The feeble efforts of a trammel'd muse, Soft Italy's fair critics round me press, And my mistaking passion, thus, accuse. Why, to our tongue's disgrace, does thy bold love, Strive, in rough sounds, soft softness to impart: He must select his words, who speaks, to move, And points his meanings, at the hearer's heart. Then, laughing, they repeat my languid lays, Nymphs, of thy native clime, perhaps, they cry, For whom thou hast a tongue, may feel thy praise, But we must understand, e're we comply. Do thou, my soul's soft hope! these triflers awe, Tell 'em, that it imports not, what I writ, Since love, from silent looks, can language draw, And scorns the lame impertinence of wit. Verses, writ for, and sent to, a Widow Gentlewoman, on Occasion of her Son's Melancholy, upon their Losses, and Disappointments in Life. Welcome, ah! welcome, life's last friend, decay! Faint on, tir'd soul and lapse, unmourn'd, away; Now, I look back, asham'd, at hope's false blaze, That shone, delightful, on my happier days; In their true colours, now, too late, I see, What youth, and pride, and mirth, and praise, must be! Bring, then, great curer, death, thy dark relief, And save me, from vain sense of hopeless grief. Shut me for ever from the suffering scene, And leave long voids for silent rest between. Thy hand can snatch me from a weeping son, Heir to my woes, and born to be undone! Place me, where I, no more, his wrongs shall hear, Nor his told sorrows reach my shelter'd ear. Thus while I mourn'd, retir'd, from hated light, Sleep came, and hid affliction, in the night; The night, instructive to my bold complaint, In a long dream, did that sad march re-paint, That pomp of tears, which did, for Sheffield, flow, Who, lately, blacken'd half our streets, with woe. There, cry'd a pointing seraph, look! compare! And blush, forgetful, of your light despair! What has this mother lost, as far distrest, Beyond her sex, as, late, beyond 'em, blest! Son of her soul! her child, by mind, and birth, Bright, by her fires, and guardian of her worth; Promise of virtues, to the rising age! Yet, ah! how blasted is the lov'd presage! Think of her loss, her weight of woe bemoan, And, humbly conscious, sigh not, for your own. The Stage's Improvement, an Epigram. The Patent laugh'd at, its supporters gone, Blank verse depos'd, and silence creeping on! Aid us, ye Gods! cry'd H?h?re, in distress, Save our great Play-house, and be damn'd the less. O'er rebel worth let licens'd dulness blaze, Teach us our willing dignity to raise. Strong, as our plans, let our performance rise, And fortune grant us, what our wit denies. Think, O, ye pow'rs! whose fortunes are at stake, Let Tragedy succeed, for my lov'd sake; With tints, like Jack's, re-touch the faded stage, 'Till it, like Widow W?k's charms engage: The smiling gods these pray'rs, together, sum, At once, indulge 'em all—and lo! Tom Thumb. EPIGRAM. [Widow W?ks came, of late, in a terrible rage] Widow W?ks came, of late, in a terrible rage, To the other old ladies, joint props of her stage: Hear me, sisters, she cry'd—I pronounce a decree, We'll have no more new Tragedies—take that from me. When we make the town laugh, I'm as merry, as they, But, I'm ten times more sad, at a grave losing play. Never tell me of sense—it has cost me a fall, And, if nonsense befriends not, I'm sure to lose all. Well, well, cry'd J?k E?l?s, and shrug'd, with a sneer, Tho' you'll give 'em no Tragedy, what shou'd you fear? Say, when ask'd, why 'twas done, your next benefit night, Nature form'd you for farce—and they'll swear you say right. St. Matthew, Chapter v. The son of God, beheld the numerous train, And would not let 'em follow him, in vain. To a near mountain, he directs his way, Whence, best, his voice might his discourse convey. Around him, wide, the gath'ring audience press'd, Whom thus, aloud, their gracious guide address'd: Blessed are they, whose hearts are free from pride, Angels, high thrones, for humble souls, provide; Blessed are they, who, here, sharp sorrows feel, The joys of heav'n shall all earth's mis'ries heal: Unsought prosperities shall crown the meek; And righteous souls shall find the food they seek: Blessed are they, in whom soft mercy reigns, Mercy, in heav'n, the merciful obtains: The pure, in heart, the face of God shall see; And mild peace-makers shall his children be. Do not, ye happy few! ye chosen train! Of worldly scorn, or pow'rful foes, complain: Then are ye blest, when men the trials make, How nobly ye can suffer, for my sake: When false accusers persecute ye most, And proud revilers of your ruins boast; Instead of mourning, then, let triumph reign, For great is the reward, ye, thence, shall gain. Just so, of old, were the good prophets us'd, So scorn'd, so pointed at, and so accus'd. You are the salt, for seasoning all mankind, God does your savour, in your suff'rings, find: Salt, without savour, no wise hand will chuse, For, who would keep a thing, he cannot use? But, since you light the world, yourselves must shine, Your lustre must adorn your bright design. None does a torch, beneath a bushel, hide, When he would have its light shoot strong, and wide. A city, on a mountain, must be shown, 'Tis seen at distance, and, at distance, known. Live, therefore, so, that men, by praising you, May glorify your heav'nly father, too. Let none, among ye, mis-conceive my aim, As if, to overthrow your laws, I came. I come not, to destroy, but to fulfil, The prophet's word, and my great father's will. Believe me! earth shall sooner pass away, And all the glorious lamps of heav'n decay, Than one small tittle of God's sure decree, Stand, un-perform'd, tho' it mistaken be. There are, who strive about degrees above, Where rank is never gain'd by pride, but love: He, who does God's appointed rules obey, And teaches men, to keep his holy way; He shall be great, in heav'n, by his reward; He least, who least does heav'n's high will regard. I know, ye think, the Pharisees, and Scribes Most fill'd, with righteousness, throughout the tribes: And yet, unless yourselves more righteous are, Ye dream of heav'n, but ne'er shall enter there. Your old Law says, if murder you commit, You shall to judgment come, and answer it: But learn, from me, that he, whom passion guides, Shall suffer further, than that law decides: Both he, who kills, and he, whom pride shall swell, Shall hazard not man's wrath, but that of hell. When, therefore, to the altar you would go, And offer up, to heav'n, the pray'rs you owe, Examine well your breast, without disguise, And search, if, there, no hidden malice lies; If so, go back—forgive, and be forgiven, And then, with welcome zeal, petition heaven. Again, your law, regarding only facts, Forbids you to commit adult'rous acts: I think, the fact not needful to the sin; For he, who wishes, does, to act, begin. All this, to man's loose will, may seem severe, But God requires obedience, love, and fear. Should thy right hand, or eye, obstruct thy bliss, And bid thee turn thine ear, from sounds, like this, Pluck out that eye, and cast that hand away, Whose ill advice would lead thy soul astray; For single parts of thee may better die, Than that the whole, in endless pain, should lie. A marry'd man, who, licens'd by your laws, Puts off his wife, must give some written cause: But, I say, he, who puts his wife away, Except, for breach of honour, makes her stray: And he, who marries that abandon'd wife, Commits adult'ry, and pollutes his life. So, says your antient law, if once you swear, With strict regard, a breach of oath forbear: But, I command you, not to swear at all: Not, by high heav'n, for 'tis God's council-hall: Not, by the earth, the object of his grace; Nor, by Jerusalem, his chosen place: Not, by your head, shall you presume to swear, Who cannot change the colour of one hair. Let yes, and no, your guiltless converse fill, For all beyond, is insolent, and ill. The partial vengeance of your Hebrew law, Bids tooth for tooth, and eye for eye, to draw: I say, resist not: but, of pride bereft, To him, who strikes thy right cheek, turn thy left. And, if at law, some wretch thy coat should sue, Give him both that, and thy next garment, too: Go two miles length, with him, who drives thee one, And, from the boldest borrower, never run. Your law says, love your neighbour, hate your foe; I say, that charity may farther go: Love friends and foes: ev'n them, who curse you, bless, Do good to those, who hate, to you, profess, Pray for your persecutors, 'midst their scorn, With god-like clemency, your minds adorn. The same sun shines, alike, on good and ill, And equal show'rs their barns, with plenty, fill. If you love none, but those, who value you, The Publicans, themselves, can do so, too. But you, God's chosen, must example give, Not live, like them, but teach them, how to live. St. Matthew, Chapter vi. Part of the Sermon on the Mount. Let shining charity adorn your zeal, The noblest impulse gen'rous minds can feel: But, have a care, you take this virtue right, And shun the glare of the proud hypocrite. Mistaken men! who, fond of public fame, Disgrace the act, while they affect the name! On earth, vain-glorious zeal may meet regard, But heav'n nor owns it, nor vouchsafes reward. Thou, on the contrary, whose pitying breast Wou'd, as it ought, give ease to the distrest; Scarce tell thy right hand, what thy left will do, But be, at once, resolv'd, and silent, too. Secret, as night, thy pious alms convey; For God, who sees, by night, rewards, by day. So, when thy soul approaches God, in pray'r, Be not deceiv'd, as those false zealots are; Who, daily, into crowded temples press, And there, with feign'd devotion, heav'n address; But, when thou pray'st, all public notice shun, And, private, to thy inmost closet, run: There, close, and earnest, to thy duty fall, And God will shew thee, that he hears thy call. Swell not thy forms of pray'r, with wild desires, Excess of fuel choaks the brightest Fires. The erring heathen so mistake their way, And think, they best are heard, who most can say. But shun thou this, and know, God's piercing eye Sees all thy wants, before thy words come nigh. From rising malice, guard thy yielding will, Nor proudly dare, to take revenge, for ill: Thou must forgive, that God may pardon thee; For none, who pities not, shall pitied be. Misled, by av'rice, seek not wealth to gain, By hoarding treasures, which are got, in vain: Deceitful riches, which the moth destroys, Which rust consumes, or the bold thief enjoys! In heav'n's high storehouse, let your heaps be laid, A wealth, which no destroyer can invade: No moth there enters, rust corrupts not there, Nor plund'ring thief alarms the owner's care! Safe, therefore, in that place, your treasures lay; For where your riches are, your heart will stay. Secure of heav'n's regard, live free from care, Nor toil, life's common comforts to prepare: Banish vain forecast for thy needful gain, Nor let meat, drink, and cloathing, give thee pain. Observe the fowls—they neither reap, nor sow, Yet find their wants supply'd, where'er they go. Look on the lillies of the ripening field! No toil of theirs does those sweet colours yield; Yet, was not Solomon, when drest to please, So gloriously adorn'd, as one of these. If, therefore, God so feeds the feather'd train, So cloaths the grass, which withers on the plain, How much more careful will he be of you, O, faithless man! who, yet, distrusts him, too? St. Matthew, Chapter vii Condemn not, rashly, all that looks, like ill, Lest you are forc'd to drink the cup, you fill. As you sow judgment, you shall reap it, too; And, as you measure, God will measure you. Why, with such nice discernment, dost thou spy, The growing mote, that clouds thy brother's eye? Why is such zeal, to cure his blemish, shown, When beams, instead of motes, have fill'd thy own. Thou hypocrite! first, thy own blemish cure, And, then, the needful help, for his, procure? If, still, more plain instruction you require, The following form will guide your just desire: Wisely distinguish, when you mean to teach, Nor, vainly, to th' unlist'ning scorner preach. Permit not dogs, on holy fare, to dine; Nor, madly bountiful, throw pearls to swine. Lest they despise the worth, they cannot taste, And turn, and tear thee, for thy treasure's waste! Ask, and the thing thou ask'st, shall granted be; Search, and the object sought, thou soon shalt see. Knock, and, in time, thou shalt admission gain, For none e'er ask'd, or sought, or knock'd, in vain. What man, among ye, by deceit, misled, Would give his son a stone, instead of bread? Or, when an infant does a fish demand, Would reach some serpent, to his tender hand? If, therefore, you, by nature, dark, and weak, Chuse, for your children, the good things they seek, Ought you not, far more justly, to expect, Your heav'nly father will not his neglect? If, from God's will, you would your practice draw, This one short maxim sums up all his law: That very thing, to others, always do, Which you, so plac'd, would have them do to you. Broad is the gate, and wond'rous wide, the way, Through which mistaken men, to ruin, stray: Too many that way chuse, because 'tis fair, And the strait path, to shun its Thorns, forbear: But happy they, who hit the narrow gate, That leads to life, and enter, tho' 'tis strait. Beware, lest lying prophets make you sin, Who, cloath'd like sheep, are rav'nous wolves, within. Closely observe 'em, when such men you see, And, wisely, by the fruit, discern the tree. Do thorns bear grapes? or figs, on thistles, grow? Plants, by their product, best their nature show. Not ev'ry one, that owns, or spreads, my name, Shall, thence, have right, a seat, in heav'n to claim: But he, who well performs my father's will, His cup, with blessings, shall my father fill. Crowds of pretenders, on my judgment-day, Swell'd, with the pride of zeal, these words shall say: Lord, see thy servants, and thy prophets know, Who, in thy name, did mighty things, below; Calling on thee, thy wish'd assistance came, And Devils have fled before us, at thy name. Them, will I answer thus—vain is your plea; Prophets, thro' love of pow'r, not love of me! I know ye not—and the reward ye gain, By short-liv'd pride, is everlasting pain. Hear, with attention, therefore, what I say; Hear, with attention, and, with judgment, weigh: He, who now hears me, and observes me well, Does, on a rock, like the wise builder, dwell: Tho' rains descend, and rising floods o'erflow, Tho' raging winds, in hourly tempests, blow; His house stands firm, secure, and free from shock, Safe, in foundation, on its central rock. But he, who hears, and does not understand, Builds, like a fool, upon the failing sand: To storms, or floods, or rains, his fabrick yields, And the loud ruin shakes the neighb'ring fields. Here, the great Jesus stopt:—th' astonish'd crowd, In humble rev'rence of his doctrine, bow'd; Confess'd his pow'r, tho' strangers to his law, And own'd his godhead, by their inward awe. After reading an unknown Author's Book. Plain, modest, pleasant, deep, distinct, and clear, The author's honest soul was printed, here; His faithful memory past scenes surveys, His sparkling fancy, on their surface, plays: Strong understanding adds reflection's weight, And all draw purpose, from his manly heart. The Thoughts of a Cadet, the first Time upon Duty. Why bear I arms, my heart! impartial, tell: Hast thou been just, and weigh'd this purpose well? Can thy bold hopes withstand the search of truth? Can'st thou stem vanity, and conquer youth? Can'st thou obey, 'till worthy to aspire? And practice duties, thou may'st, thence, require? Calmly resolv'd, can'st thou serenely dare, And shun, alike, presumption, and despair? Can'st thou support a name, unus'd to fear, And feel no blush, to think—who plac'd thee here? What, tho' my patron's lov'd example fires! Urges my sword, and lengthens my desires! Tho' conscious want of merit sighs, aloud, Be humble—for 'twere blindness, to be proud! Still, there's a wish, that must my prospect bar; A wish, for Wisdom—that gives eyes, to war! A soul of conduct, that inspires, to know: And laughs at courage, in an untaught foe! That moulds the future, while it sifts the past; Claims victory—and bids the triumph last. Where shall a thoughtless youth this treasure find? This art of judgment, that becalms the mind? Chains anger short; and sets reflection free, Gives tumult temper—and makes fortune see? In books, 'tis endless, to pursue this hope; Guideless, and lost, in an expanse of scope. Shorten the task, and point thy happy sight, To catch, and kindle, at a living light. A Cobham's life, well read, forms ev'ry art, And gives sure title to a Dunmore's heart. On a Miser. I. If to be modest, merits praise, And pride is own'd a sin, I'll now, O miser! tune my lays, And, on thy worth, begin. II. We by religion, learn to know, That vanity's a fault, And should avoid all public show, Of fondly boasting ought. III. Thou then art, sure, 'bove others, blest, And hast more merit, too; Whose worth lay silent, in thy breast, Where none its value knew; 'Till seiz'd, by death, and laid to rest, Abroad thy bounties flew. The Misplac'd Love. I How long will lovely Amaret complain, In gentle notes, that wound each list'ning ear? How long, alas! will she delight in pain, Which choice, not fate, inclines her soul to bear! II Strange paradox of love!—the vanquish'd maid, By cruel conquest, many still destroys! What beauty gives her—passion has betray'd, And love, misplac'd, prevented all her joys. III One way, and only one, does, yet, remain, Whereby, lost peace of mind you may restore, Abandon'd ease, and your blest state regain, And live for ever happy, as before. IV Change, heedless fair one,—change your injur'd love, And bless poor A?r?n, with mutual flame; So shall the wings of pleasure, round you, move, And fan th' expanding fires, that blaze your fame. To the lovely Mrs. H?e, on her Descent from the first Saxon Kings of our Island. H?e, sweet name! whose princely meaning shows, From what high spring, your blood's rich current flows, With needless awe, reminds us of your race, Since heav'n has stampt dominion on your face. Still, in your sov'reign form, distinctly live, All royal rights, your father kings could give! In your commanding air, we mark their state, And, in your words, their wisdom, and their weight. Warm, in your noble breast, their courage lies, And all their pow'r, and mercy, in your eyes. Epilogue, spoke by Mrs. Roberts. England, they say, is famous for good-nature, Mum, for your catcalls—wit delights in satire. Pit, and fond parents, when they act severely, Tell child, they whip it—'cause they love it dearly. Well! Heav'n be prais'd, we've proofs of your affection; Lord, how you love! if we may trust correction. Not but we've been too sparing of our labours, Too negligent, and naughty—like our neighbours; Trod, in their steps—but, with repentance ample, So, half the world is spoil'd, by bad example. Great is their Stock—yet, why should that misguide us? We'll mend—Ah! you'll not trust, before you've try'd us. By things, ne'er seen, nor heard of—we provoke ye, Cram ye, with novelty—enough to choak ye. All you desire, and more, we'll pour upon ye, 'Till we have forc'd Commiseration from ye, And 'twill be odd, if change should here displease ye, Which yet, at home, has seldom fail'd to ease ye! Do—take our words—this once be kind believers, Nor think all women—born, to be deceivers. Epilogue. [One word before you go—Grave critics, say] One word before you go—Grave critics, say, The moral is the meaning of the Play: I'm sure, that hope, in ours, we did not couzen, For—let me see—I'll point out half a dozen: First—folly makes a quiet state, a mad one; Next, a good king is better than a bad one. Third, when a virtuous prude expects foul play, She'll ne'er be ravish'd—if she runs away. Fourth, by the old and young, at once, addrest, She, who prefers the young one, chuses best. Fifth, where our wits too weak, for our ambition, Our grief, and shame, keep pace, with our condition. Sixthly, and lastly—to avoid confusion, And keep the best instruction, for conclusion, A jealous fair, who would a rival hate, Should love, like me, a minister of state: Safe, in her choice, she might, in peace, caress him, And, with un-envy'd property, possess him. By claim of custom, politicians bait him, And, right, or wrong, the fair find cause to hate him. Prologue, for Mr. William Giffard, on his Benefit Night. Young, and but forming distant hopes, to please, What I have done?—that call'd for smiles, like these; 'Tis your own worth—not mine—to night, is shown! That truth my grateful heart delights to own. Shall I say more—Oh! how might words surprize, Could they but borrow power—from those bright Eyes! I feel your presence, know your worth's high rate, Yet still—tho' reason claims respect's full weight, Tho' conscious rev'rence rash presumption awes, What dumb tongue pleads not, in a Father's cause? Strong are the tides, he stems!—How good, how kind, 'Twould be!—to swell his sails, with pity's wind! Shoal'd, on the flats of your neglect, we lie, Half buoy'd—half grounded—you might float us—try. Help us to shun cold coasts of dry despair, And take th' improving future to your care. Then, shall new prospects raise our cherish'd aim, 'Till our stage lightens, and our actors flame. Nor let this pride provoke our rival's gall, The muses contests should be peaceful, all. By emulation, not by envy, mov'd, Slow time might teach us, all, to grow belov'd. Teach comic shame, to pierce the mended mind, And laugh away low tastes, that cramp mankind. Might teach the stage's foes—plain truth reigns here, And rich corruption loves a loftier sphere. Teach passion's pangs—teach how distresses shake, How hearts, that feel, bid hearts, that listen, ake. How action paints the soul, upon the eye, And the wing'd muscles, into meanings fly. Slow time can teach us this.—Slow time can do Still more:—Slow time can add new friends—like you. 'Till, to reward our will's industrious pain, No more thin benches make our labours vain; But long-wish'd favour lifting modest claim, You lend us ear, tho' you refuse us fame. Epilogue, spoke by Miss Kitty Bolton. Ladies! You'll say, since 'tis not you, I wait my doom from, Whence does this forward little gipsy come from? From my own sex, all I yet hope, is laughter; Lord knows what passions I may move, hereafter, At present, I'm too heart-whole, to complain t' ye, And not quite old enough, to give one pain t' ye. To you, dear gentlemen, with due petition, Comes a pure innocent, in soft submission; Forward presumer, I confess, to teize ye; Some years too soon (as some folks think) to please ye: Yet, smile—you can't imagine, what temptation There lies, to willing minds, in provocation. Kindly accepted now, and worth your heeding, I shall improve apace—with good stage-breeding. Let me come on, and talk, then, fear no shrinking, For I, already pay it off, with thinking. The younger, Sirs, the better—that plain fact is, And she, who soon begins—will have most practice. Yet Mamma bit poor Kitty, when she told her, She'd grow more fit to please as she grew older. Heav'n knows, indeed, what I am fit for, yet! Beauty's not mine—and I can plead no wit. Scarce had I had one claim to your compassion, But that no wit, and little worth's the fashion, That's hope—then I have learnt to sing—there's merit, Nay, I'm told, I dance not ill—that's spirit. Oh, gentlemen! trust but to future action, And, four years hence, I'll move, with strange attraction. Prologue, to Harry the 5th; intended for Mrs. Woffington, dressed in the new Blue uniform, with Firelock, (and fixed Bayonet) in her Hand. While fir'd St. George inflames his namesake's nation, Loyal St. Drury arms, in association. Quake, ye cow'd French, with your white coats, campaigning, True blue's the true heart's taste, and fears no staining. Come, if they dare—Ha! brother soldiers, let 'em, [goes up to, and shakes hands, with one of the Stage Grenadiers.] You reds, we blues—faith! we'll find means, to sweat 'em. While these brave lads march north—we, warlike lasses, Stay, cock'd, and prim'd, at home—to guard our passes. Death, to their smart Graffins!—Morbleu, we'll jerk 'em; I, and my Amazons, alone, can work 'em. Heels over head, smish-smash, the brown rascallions, And cool the courage of sev'n Pope's battalions! Well, but 'till danger quits its humble distance, I'll ground my firelock—and suspend resistance. [Grounds in the military Posture.] Ladies—a word—be arm'd against occasion, Charge your bright eyes—and shoot at French invasion. Queens of these manly souls, so fam'd for battle, Laugh at cockaded, henpeck'd, tame, French cattle. Well may you, conquering beauties! hope to dash 'em, When their own buff-skin wives claim right to thrash 'em. 'Tis the French Mode, to cow're, when wedlock chatters, One scold—can shake their Salic Law—to tatters. Ne'er flinch—but box their ears; they're men of breeding, And, when advanc'd on—fam'd, for swift receding. Od's me! I'll wear no needless breeches—hang em! Coarse, bob-tail'd, canvas petticoats can bang em! Why should maids fight, be-mann'd, be-bluff'd, be-raked, The weakest she can do their business naked. Oh! what a day was Agincourt, for Britain! Stand to the cause, that this brave play was writ on. Let the false friends, who hide themselves among ye, Feel, by loud Claps, your country's wrongs have stung ye. Harry, 'gainst six to one—could hold France to it; And, pray, Sirs, why not we?—By George, we'll do it. Odds, to the Brave, are lights, that best display 'em, The more French Jacks come here, the more we'll pay 'em. Paltry presumers!—can't they—pert, and handy, Crop vines, press grapes, and dance, to their own brandy, But, o'er all Europe, they must needs shift stations, And shake their wooden shoes, o'er free-born nations, As for their friends, and good allies—the Highlands, Short wint'ry storms rise quick, in all bleak islands, Oft have they blown—from Caitness point, to Dover, But, still, the louder blast—the sooner over. Lifting, to fight, far north, on cool Reflection, May hurt a female volunteer's complexion. No matter—Better look as brown, as breezes, Tann'd, to the foes—like your Mesdames Francoises, Than blush, for shame, thro' faint, fine cheeks, in Lunnon: So, Sirs, farewel—I'll march, and take my gun on, [Takes up her Firelock, and marches off shoulder'd] Prologue, spoken by a young Gentleman, At a Play, called the Tuscan Treaty, acted for the Benefit of Mr. William Bond, in Covent Garden Theatre. Friends have such sov'reign pow'r to task the heart, We must obey 'em, tho' we want the art! Hence, has it fall'n, this evening, to my share, To read a play-house lecture, tho' no player. Think me not, thence, less fit.—Their business, here, Is but plain nature—hers, the smile, and tear! From truth, not time, the actor takes his fame, And length of practice gives but bastard claim; Else, would the oldest mistress be the toast, And wives, who plagu'd you, longest, please you most. To act, is then, to imitate, 'tis true; But take that truth, with a distinction, too; Wou'd but each actor, imitating well, Learn, from himself, another to excel: Search his own bosom; copy, from within, Seize your attention, and your passions win; Then, would the stage, of no neglect, complain, But love, and grief, and pity, charm, again. Yet, were there play'rs, like me, who, void of art, Felt not the anguish, that inspires their part, What ill-judg'd rantings would untune distress! With weak varieties, of wild excess! Among such play'rs, methinks, e'en I could shine; Strike out new walks, and charm, with new design. Now, in big sounds, I'd bowl away, to fame, And nod, and sink, and lumber, into name. From side, to side, next, with enormous swing, I'd heave on majesty, and puff the king. Two foot, too short, that single fault I'd feel, And eke my length out, with a yard of heel. For solemn utt'rance, has applause been due? I'd have that art, to force applauses, too. With slow-rais'd foot, keep time, to my own drawl, 'Till sleep's befriending influence hushes all. Such actors have been seen!—but wou'd your taste Distinguish, nor submit to praise, in haste; Well mortify'd, while censur'd into fame, Thought would instruct 'em, how to 'scape your blame. Nature would mark the look, adapt the mien, And passions, rightly painted, grace the scene. Scorn, at presumptuous ignorance, would rise, And shoot reproachful, from averted eyes. Sorrow, in mournful accents, humbly flow, And melt the stubborn heart, in weeping woe. Wonder, the starting eye-brows, upward, draw, And, on the posture, stamp a speechless awe. Joy, to the features, would restore their grace, And light up all the lustre of the face. Anger would gnash the teeth, the nostrils strain, Swell, in each muscle, boil, in ev'ry vein; With restless motion, agitate the frame, Burst out, like thunder; and like light'ning, flame. Thus, I conceive, but want the pow'r, to show, What actors should, to art, and nature, owe; Such, when you find—'tis thiers, the scene to raise, 'Tis yours, to mark their worth, and fix their praise. Prologue, spoke by Mrs. Heron, at her Benefit, after the Misfortune of putting out both her Knee-pans. The poor, maim'd soldier, from his duty freed, Safe, and at ease, commences invalid, I, like the wounded sons of brave old Rome, Call'd, by the cause I love, my post resume; And, quitting rest, lest it should seem neglect, Forget my tears, to bring you my respect. Who (by your pow'rful praises, once made vain) Could stoop to languish, in a sense of pain? Sweet smiling hope resign, for sullen ease. And, (against nature) wish no more, to please! The generous heart will some compassion show, Where pleasures (only ours) are chang'd for woe. But, ah! what anguish did my steps pursue, While 'twas my life's whole task, to pleasure you! Could but my misery merit your regard, Be your kind pity all my wish'd reward. Proud, I return, your servant to remain; Scarce does she live at all, who lives, in vain. What's a dark world, where hopes no longer chear? Your loss were death—'tis life to find you, here. The Garden Window. Here, Amanda, gently bending, Sweetly pensive, loves to lean, O'er the groves, her sight extending, Thro' the walks, that shoot between; Plac'd, says she, within this window, Screen'd, I distant charms survey, Taught, by poor deceiv'd Olindo, Nothing's safe, that looks too gay. Here, I view, in soften'd shadings, Am'rous flow'r, to flow'r incline, Too remote to mourn their fadings, When, with hanging heads they pine. Here, I smell the fragrant breezes, Safe, from ev'ning's chilly blast; Here the noonday sun-shine pleases, Fearless, when 'twill overcast. Hence, I hear the tempest rising, See the grovy greatness shake; Ev'ry distant ill despising, While I ev'ry good partake. So, commanding life's gay garden, Let, me, thornless, wear the rose; Choice, like mine, let fashion pardon, Tasting charms, but shunning woes. At Setting Day: A SONG. I Since sounding drums, and rising war, Invite my love to danger, I'll ask, of ev'ry smiling star, To shield my roving ranger. II While o'er the field, unfearing wounds, You press the foe, retreating, I'll trace the dear remember'd bounds, Of our more gentle meeting. III I'll pass whole days, in yon sweet grove, Where first thy tongue deceiv'd me, When, list'ning dumb, I blush'd my love, And no fear'd absence griev'd me. IV On ev'ry bank thy side has prest, I'll sleep, and dream, I'm near thee; And each sweet bird, that strains its breast, Shall wake my hopes to hear thee. V To all our haunts, I will repair, And, cold, on yon bleak mountain, Trace all thy once-trod foot-steps there, And weep o'er each sad fountain. VI There, will I teach the trees to wear Thy name, in soft impression, And borrow sighs, from ev'ning air, To swell my soul's confession. To Dr. Atkins; on his Arcade of Dutch Elms, dug up, in repairing the Sewer. Pitying, we sigh'd, to see th'uprooting spade, Boldly intrenching, fall your fav'rite shade! Sad Silvia, long, with silent sorrow, strove, At last, thus loudly, wail'd her prostrate grove: Ah! Doctor, when you planted for delight, Why did you fail to search foundations, right? Shoot, else, th' aspiring branches ne'er so gay; Pale disappointment grows, as fast, as they. Why mourn I then?—'tis vain, 'tis causeless grief; And thus reflexion comes, and brings relief. Common, in life, your fate, ye hapless trees! So the green lawn's, of hope's gay prospects, please. Sap-full, and blooming, each luxuriant shoot! Yet death lies lurking, at th'unheeded root. So flourishes, in youth, our love's light joy, For time, or change of passion to destroy. So shines religion's boast, with specious glow, While sin's foul common sewer creeps dark, below. So factious noise, we patriot purpose call, While private int'rest works, and saps us all. So fame, in arms, or arts, or learning, tow'rs; And fond presuming fancy calls it ours; 'Till, from beneath, some blast, unfear'd, is felt, And life's lost views, like air-form'd fabricks, melt. Prologue, for a distressed Widow. If aught, sweet charity! can make thee shine, With added lustre, and a ray divine, 'Tis when thy pity, un-appropriate, flows, And joy-touch'd hearts adopt the stranger's woes. 'Tis, when the graceful giver seems to pay; When want, and blush, at once, are charm'd away. 'Tis, when relief's kind face comes dress'd, in smiles, And no cold insult, where it saves—reviles. Where aided anguish feels no bite of shame, And modest mercy wears but friendship's name. Small gifts grow large, which chearful hands impart, And sorrow's pang no more contracts the heart: So human pow'r, to god-like heights, we raise; For the preserver shares the maker's praise. 'Tis yours, to-night, the widow's sighs to chear, And dry the lone-left orphan's silent tear. So charm'd, thro' death, to find his relicks blest, Sooth'd, shall the ling'ring shade submit to rest; Safe, to your hands, resign the tender trust, And glide no longer, o'er the friendless dust. Epilogue, for a Lady, who acted Eudocia, in the Siege of Damascus, represented at the Duke of Bedford's, at Wooburn. I've heard of maids, who first resolve, too fast, And then weigh arguments, when facts are past: Young, tho' my reason is, not so, it stray'd; But, first, found pleadings, for the part, I play'd. Play'd, said I?—second thought that word retracts; Fancies and follies play, but passion acts: Passion! the spring, that all life's wheels employs, Winds up the working thought—and heightens joys. Passion! the great man's guide, the poor man's blame; The soldier's lawrel, and the sigher's flame. Passion! that leads the grave, impels the gay, Bids the wise tremble, and the fool betray. Ev'n at this hour, what's here our pastime made, Gives the court business, and the kingdom, trade; When factions quarrel, or when statesmen fall, Each does but act his part, at passion's call. Like our's, to night, Lord Passion sets their task; Their fears, hopes, flatt'ries—all are passion's masque. The world's wide stage, for this one practice, fill'd, Sees some act, nobly, others play unskill'd. Triflers, and smarts, who toy time's dream away, Sots, beaux, and hounds of party, these but play. Sons of their country's hope, sublimely, rackt, For other's rest.—These do not play, but act. Who play the poorest parts?—the bought, the vain, The light believer, and the perjur'd swain; The dull, dry joker, the coarse, ill-bred bear, The friends of folly, and the foes of care. Who act their parts, with praise—the firm, the just, Who sell no sentiments, and break no trust; The learn'd, the soft, the social, and the kind, The faithful lover, and the plain good mind. Such the bect actors—form'd for honour's stage! Who play no farces, and disgrace no age. But, copying nature, with true taste, like ours, Please, and are pleas'd, and wing the guiltless hours. Apology for Death. Whence this reluctance, when we cease to run Life's slow, sad race, and leave its toys un-won? Death's but our Tide of Ebb, to that dark sea, Time's shoreless swallower, void eternity! 'Tis rest, from labour—'tis escape from care; 'Tis shunn'd oppression, and reliev'd despair. 'Tis but to re-dissolve, to formless flow, And join the mingled mass, that feels no woe. Fluid, to fade, as all things, round us, do, Or, from old being, launch, to find out new. Emerging, or immerg'd, life rolls away, Foams, into note, or flattens to decay. Round, with unceasing wheel, distinction glides, And, thro' time's maze, in short successions, slides: Flames its hot hour, like humbler houshold fires, Shines, but to leave us, and, in use, expires. 'Tis the flash'd spark of thought, that bursts to sight, Strains soon, and big, and rushes into night: So the proud storm, that frights us, with its roar, Breathes itself weary, and is heard no more. See! that soft flow'r, whose sighs perfume the gales, Blooms into dust, and its snuff'd life exhales! All nature heaves, and sets, like human breath, And life's loose links but stretch the chain of death. Why, then, does erring fancy fright the mind? Why call that cruel, nature meant for kind? Who knows, but fates, we tremble at, may bless, And length of happiest life be found distress? Murder! that blast of thought! that bane of law! The good man's horror, and ev'n villain's awe! Murder! that nature dreads, and conscience flies! Perhaps, but spurs us, to some waiting prize! Else, why should creature, still, with creature, jarr? And clash'd existence wage eternal war? Beast bleeds, by beast; fishes, on fishes, prey, And birds act murder, with more waste, than they; Ev'n the sweet thrush, that bribes us, with her song, To guard her dread of death, from beaks, more strong, Sav'd, from the kite, strait bloodier grows, than he, And snaps the shiv'ring insect, from the tree. Life starts but up, to answer death's due call, And one mysterious darkness wraps us all! Passing a Lady, in the Park, without seeing her. So slide our comforts by, unmark'd, unknown, While our ill fate comes felt, and all our own! Too cruel world! where things, we wou'd refuse, We start upon—and, what we wish, we lose! And, yet, Lotharia would be hid, in vain, She cannot be conceal'd, whom thoughts retain. Air, and Lotharia, every where, are found; Held by our breath, and, to our being, bound! Darkness, itself, wants pow'r to cover friends, Whom the soul dwells with, and the sense attends. To the Lady, that laughs, at dying in Metaphor. And why, fair Trifler, does that meaning eye Smile, in contempt, when lovers swear they die? 'Twixt death, and love, but one small diff'rence lies, The soul, in both, from its left body flies: In death, 'tis gone, like smoak, dissolv'd in air, Lost, in expance, the loser knows not where: In love, we trace it, with such willing pain, 'Twere to die twice, to take it back again. Modesty. As Lamps burn silent, with unconscious light, So modest ease, in beauty, shines most bright: Unaiming charms, with edge resistless, fall, And she, who means no mischief, does it all. To a Lady, who sent back the Top af a Sweet-briar Branch, and retained the worst End of it. While the way of the world is, to keep all the best, And then, in due form, oblige friends, with the rest, You, Madam, who would lend, ev'n trifles, a grace, Teach your meanings to borrow a smile, from your face; And, polite, to your pain, when a present you send, Give the thorn to yourself, and the rose to your friend. To the Lady who sends me all her good Wishes. Suppose, that the sun had a tongue, and shou'd say, May your journey be bless'd, with a very fine day: Then, withdrawing his face, slip aside, with his light, And surround me, at once, with the coldness of night; What would Florimel say, to this trick of the sun? I would say, cry'd the charmer, 'twas cruelly done. Would you so, answer'd I?—have a care what you own, Who have wish'd me all blessings, yet granted me none. To a Lady, who was expected, in vain, on a Sunday. That the eye's pow'r could shake the heart, I knew: Is there, who doubts it?—let him look on you: And wit, in woman's tongue was ne'er found weak; Witness their suff'rings, who have heard you speak. Yet, strong, as woman's wit, and charms are thought, They've one strange influence, 'till this hour, untaught: Safely oppos'd to God's decrees, they stand, And smile, unhurt, in face of heav'n's command. Let this, said God, a day of rest remain; You came not—and it prov'd, a day of pain. A SONG. [Love's the cause of all my weeping] I Love's the cause of all my weeping, Cou'd I but declare my pain; He, who has my heart, in keeping, Might be brought to love again. II Maiden's virtue spoils their pleasure; If it were but once decreed, Virgins, for themselves, might measure, Love would, then, be sweet, indeed. III But that check upon our nature, Freezing up our youthful heats, Only spoils a pretty creature, Teaching her to gnaw the sheets. To a Lady, who sung inwardly. Kindly suppress'd, your voice rolls soft, within, And, in slow warblings, holds its transports in; Yourself unpleas'd, in giving others pain, The tide of tuneful mischiefs you restrain: So, the fierce beams, which make all nature bright, Revolving inward, check their long'd-for light; Lest, deluging the world with seas of fire, We die, beneath the lustre, we require. Writ upon a Pain of Glass in Westminster House. All happy, then, while o'er their smiling air, A living mother breath'd her guardian care; But, joyless, since their sweet supporter dy'd, They wander, now, thro' life, with half a guide. August 25, 1731. To a Lady, who talked not much. Charmers, like you, are dumb, in vain, Their very silence speaks too plain: That sparkling eloquence of eyes, Proclaims you lovely, gay, and wise; While the mild meanings of your air, A soul, as soft, as ev'ning show'rs, declare. Your ev'ry motion, arm'd, with speaking grace, Tells some new wonder, and assists your face. Bellaria, at her Spinnet. Sweetly confus'd, with scarce consenting will, Thoughtless of charms, and diffident of skill; See! with what blushful bend, the doubting fair Props the rais'd lid—then sits, with sparkling air, Tries the touch'd notes—and, hast'ning light along, Calls out a short complaint, that speaks their wrong. Now backn'ning, aweful, nerv'd, erect, serene, Asserted musick swells her heighten'd mien. Fearless, with face oblique, her formful hand Flies o'er the ivory plain, with stretch'd command; Plunges, with bold neglect, amidst the keys, And sweeps the sounding range, with magic ease. Now, two contending senses—ear, and eye, In pride of feasted taste, for transport, vye; But what avails two destin'd slaves debate,— When both are sure to fall, and share one fate? Whether the god, within, evolving round, Strikes in her notes, and flows, dissolv'd, in sound; Or, silent, in her eyes, enthron'd, in light, Blazes, confess'd to view, and wounds our sight. This way, or that, alike, his pow'r we try, To see, but kills us—and, to hear, we die. Oh! far-felt influence of the speaking string! Prompt, at thy call, the mounting soul takes wing; Waves, in the gale, fore-runs th' harmonious breeze, And sinks, and rises, to the changeful keys. But, hark! what length'ning softness, thrilling new, Steals, 'twixt the solemn swells, and threads 'em through: 'Tis her transporting voice!—she sings—be still, Sweet strings, forbear!—ye hurt her sweeter skill. Yet, no—sound on—the strong, and sweet, should join; With double pow'r, mix'd opposites combine. 'Tis plain! my captive senses feel it true; Ah, what dire mischiefs may not union do! Cou'd she not save delight, from half this strain? Heard, and beheld, at once!—'tis hopeless pain. Fly, and escape—let one press'd sense retire; The rais'd hat shades it, from the darted fire. Alas! vain screen!—the soul's unclouded ray Sees, from within, by a new blaze of day: Sees the spread roof, with op'ning glories, crown'd, And radiant deities descending round! Throng'd, in bright lines, or wing'd, in ambient air, Spirits, in fairy forms, inclose the fair. Some, on the keys, in am'rous ambush, lie, And kiss the tune-tipt fingers, dancing by. Some, hov'ring wide, expiring shakes prolong, And pour 'em back, to swell the rising song. Gods, in abridgment, crowd their needless aid, And Pow'rs, and Vertues, guard th' unconscious maid. Pity, with tears of joy, stands, weeping, near; Kneeling devotion hangs her list'ning ear, Candor, and truth, firm-fix'd on either hand, Propping her chair, two sure supporters stand! Round her, while wrong'd belief imbibes new strength, And hugs th' instructive notes, and aids their length, Love, and his train of Cupids craftier cares Scatter, with plumy fans, the dreaded airs. Pride, from a distant corner, glooms a leer, And longs, yet hopes not, to be call'd more near: But Charity sits close—a well known guest, Bold, and domestic—and domands her breast. High, o'er her cheeks, to shade their tempting glow, Shame, and soft modesty, their mantles throw: While, from her brow, majestic wisdom, seen, Tempers her glory, and inspires her mien. Such, and, perhaps, more sweet, those sounds shall rise, Which wake rewarded saints, when nature dies: When heavn's heard blast shall shake the stubborn mind, And one mix'd melody unite mankind! When time's last wreck shall sink, in seas of flame. And void eternity resumes its name, Celia, in the Garden. I Come, walk, and rouse the languid year: All nature blooms, when you appear; Each leafless oak would bud a-new, And push out shade, to shelter you. Your sight would summer's want supply; You gone—'tis winter—and we die. II Yon warbling nightingale complains, Your praise, too seldom, tempts her strains: The tow'ring lark but hears you sing, And soars, to heav'n, with silent wing. Come, angels, come, (he cries)—and see Yourselves, as much out-done, as me. III Each violet sighs itself to death, To scent the gales, that fans your breath: Stop but, and see th' unfolding rose, With emulative blushes, glows: While hood-wink'd lillies prostrate lie, Asham'd, to see your breast, so nigh. IV Look round, and smile—and ev'ry flow'r Smiles, too—and charms, with ten-fold pow'r. Depart, and lo! they bend and fall, And weeping dew-drops waste 'em all. 'Tis thus, your love inflames my joy, And, thus your coldness might destroy. The Recollected Complainer. All mother, as I am, and loth to part, With this poor playful gladd'ner of my heart, I know, too well, and I confess my crime, 'Tis not my right, but heav'n's, to limit time: Parent, at once, of progeny, and pain, Of what would my regardless grief complain? I gave him birth, but, ah! discern'd not why! Children are born, poor suff'rers! but to die. Pity ('tis true) revolves their leapful springs, Smil'd thanks, attoning pray'rs, embracing clings, Sallies of guileless joy, gay gleams of sense, Soft stroking flatt'ries—active impotence; Tricks of dumb love, which grateful wills express, And all their nameless pow'rs of prettiness! These the fond mother's feeling mem'ry seize, And, then, the tear of nature flows, for ease. But reason's voice corrects the bold complaint, Injoins submission, and instructs restraint. Thus wipes the plaintive parent's weeping eye, And bids the unpermitted drop—be dry. What is it, thou thyself, mistaking Mind! Hast found, in this bad world, or hop'st to find? That thy presumptuous wish would dare retain, Whom heavn's kind call exempts from future pain: Grant, that the worst thou fear'st, should end this blow, And death's dark screen defends thy child, from woe! Are not thy sad forebodings, too, no more? Are not thy fears, for all his perils, o'er? Of what proud wrongs, might clog his life's long way! What crimes might blast him, or, what wiles betray! What follies draw down scorn, what vice disgrace! What loss of honour might be-spot thy race! What want of Duty might neglect thy tears! What want of prudence, grind his waning years! What bloody dangers might cut short his fame, Or hooting infamy prolong his shame! Look up, fond sorrower! see the morning's ray; Now, if thou can'st, fore-judge the rising day: Shall its ascending shine continue bright? Or, shall o'ercasting tempests call down night? Can'st thou not tell?—Why, then, does thy bold guess Presume to call an infant's death Distress? Blind to the future,, thank a watchful God, That snatch'd the child from school, to spare the rod. The Resignation. Well! be it so—Sorrow, that streams not o'er, Spares but the eye, to wound the heart the more: Dumb, infelt pangs, too well, supply the woe, That grief, in suff'ring silence, shuns to show. Yet, let my will's reluctant pride submit, And learn to love the lot, that heav'n found fit. All, I can lose, God gave—and, when 'tis flown, Whom does he wrong, who but resumes his own? Should I, in fruitless agony, complain, Fretting my wound, but multiplies my pain: While they, who patiently embrace distress, Teach shame, to satisfy, and grief, to bless. Whate'er has been, 'tis madness, to regret; Whate'er must be, shocks least, when braveliest met, Learn then, my soul, thy course, resign'd to run, And never pray thy will—but God's, be done. Copies, for Children to learn to write. The Body's beauty dwells in shape, and face, The soul's, in mildness, modesty, and grace; The first but charms an earthly lover's eye, The last draws angels, from beyond the sky; One, for a moment, man's frail heart procures, The other makes your God, for ever, yours. Advice to the Virgins, to guard against Flattery. Fairest! forgive the too officious lay, That sends the muse, you charm, to smooth your way, I, tho' admiring, act no lover's part, Nor bid soft sounds seduce your list'ning heart: Candidly touch'd, my pen's obtrusive fear, Nor dares to shock, nor aims to sooth your ear; Needless, 'tis true, to bid such nymphs, beware, Who ev'ry grace, and virtue, make their care: Yet, modest excellence will oft descend, To thank, unwanted, caution, in a friend. A faithful pilot, fervent, in his fears, And, trembling, anxious for the worth, he steers. 'Twere mortal pain, to see such beauty mourn, By bold distress, or impious falsehood, torn. Love's gay delusion tempts, a thousand ways; Now, wounds, with softness; now destroys, with praise. Thy veil, O Flatt'ry! hides a traitor's heart, And gives up confidence—a prey to art: Unbridled youth, to consequences, blind, Indulging body, hears no call of Mind. Feeble discretion, so, by warmth, o'er-run, Does, with a peacock's feather, fan the sun. Beauty, that trusts too fast, is beauty's bane, A self-betrayer, that embraces pain. Oh! hear, suspicious, when the lover sues; She most attracts, who longest can refuse. Poize the try'd terms, on which his hope depends, Prop'd, on the parent's council, and the friend's: So, leaning safe, and wanting space, to stray, Love's guardian angels crown your nuptial day. Or, should the gilded hypocrite, at last, Show, that he meant your spotless fame to blast; Fly the found tempter, each low lure despise, And lift your heart's wrong'd wish above surprize. Nature, that form'd you loveliest, doubly kind, To like perfection, rais'd your conquering mind. Fram'd you to truth, to virtue turn'd your taste, For honour, dress'd you, and, for rev'rence, grac'd. Freedom regain'd, pursue the shining track, And leave the base repenter, to his rack. Then, bless the verse, that from such ruin, sav'd An artless conqu'ror, by success, enslav'd: Now, happy, painless hours shall un-perplex The best-lov'd pattern of the loveliest sex. Lesbia's Lamentation, on the Death of her Sparrow; altered from Mr. Cartwright. I Tell me not of joy—There's none, Now my little sparrow's gone? He, just like you, Would toy, and woo: He would chirp, and flatter me; And, 'till he saw me look, and smile, Lord! how sullen he would be! II He would catch a crumb, and then, Sporting, let it go, again; He, from my lip, Would sit, and sip, From my plate, he lov'd to feed, Here, wou'd hop, and there would run, And ev'ry look, and motion, heed, 'Till my very heart he won. III O! how eager he would fight! And never hurt, tho' often bite! He perch'd, alas! Upon my glass, And ev'ry thing, I did, would do: Ruffling, now, his feathers, all, Now, as sudden, let them fall, And, then, grew proud, and sleek'd 'em, too. IV Wou'd'st thou, Cupid, reach a heart, With his feathers, wing thy dart: Love might, that way, Sure wounds convey. But my faithful bird is gone; Mournful turtles, murmur on. Hop, ye Red-breasts, o'er his stone; Cease to sing, and learn to mourn. The Messenger. Go, happy paper! gently steal, And, soft, beneath her pillow, lie: There, in a dream, my love reveal, A love, that awe must, else, conceal, In silent doubt, to die. Should she, to flames, thy hope consign, Thy suff'ring moment soon expires; A longer pain, alas! is mine, Condemn'd, in endless woe, to pine, And feel unslack'ning fires. But, if inclin'd to hear, and bless, While, in her heart, soft pity stirs; Tell her—her beauties might compel A hermit, to forsake his cell, And change his heav'n, for hers. Oh! tell her—were her treasures mine, Nature, and art would court my aid; The painter's colours want her shine; The rainbow's brow not half so fine, As her sweet eye-lids shade! By day, the sun might spare his rays; No star make ev'ning bright; Her op'ning eyes, with sweeter blaze, Should measure all my smiling days, And, if she slept, 'twere night. To Dr. Atkins, on his Birth-day. To a length of new birth-days, your health we drink round, In this glass of good punch, may your sickness be drown'd; You've insur'd a long life, by your gout held so fast, And your grand climacteric, this morning, o'erpast: So, we've nothing to wish you, but bliss, at a stay, 'Till the nation hates bribes, and her rogues run away. The Mis-grounded Compassion. You've heard it, and read it, a million of times, That men are made up of delusions, and crimes. Look over old stories, and search all the new, You'll find, in love-trusts, not a man of us, true. Then, why this reproachful, and termagant face? Why so feelingly fierce, for another's disgrace? Oh! I learn, by your blush, the true cause of your pain, You were bit, by the tooth against which you complain. What a pity, this sense of a sufferer's fate, Came a little too home, and a good deal too late! Had you felt, for a friend, e'er yourself was betray'd, Such a well-tim'd concern might have made you afraid; And the caution your own, tho' another's, the evil, You had safely defy'd love, old apes, and the devil. On the Death of the Czarina, Wife to Peter the Great. Thus, to the long-lov'd partner of his reign, Spoke great Alexiowits, in death's last pain: Now, be the world's vast empire yours, alone; She heard—re-claim'd his breast, and scorn'd his throne. Glad, to the realms of light, a ghost, she flew, Found her lost lord, and charm'd him, to her view. O! check th' amazement, in your looks, she cry'd, Nor blame th' impatient haste, with which, I dy'd. Kind was your trust—but, when you ceas'd to share, You left the world, you gave, beneath my care, A SONG. [As Damon sat by Silvia's side] I As Damon sat by Silvia's side And watch'd her eyes, with am'rous pride, He gently bow'd his leaning head, And, while it prest Her charming breast, Thus, the transported shepherd said. II Thou smiling cause of rest, and pain! The youth, who loves not, lives in vain. What charms have eyes, where wishes meet! Where souls combine, And two hearts join, Hope is unbounded; joy compleat. III No lamb, of all the bleating care, Looks softer, than thy passions are: Possessing thee, by thee, possest, I fear no pain; I wish no gain; Who, that's in heav'n, would more be blest? The Gnat. I While, in the Mall, my Celia shone, And drew th' adoring world, to gaze, A wanton gnat came, buzzing, on, To gambol, in her blaze. II Enliven'd, by her lucid beams, And urging bliss, too nigh, Th' attractive beauty's pow'rful streams O'erwhelm'd him, in her eye. III The glowing orb, swift, catching fire; Now heat was mix'd, with light; The wing, that durst so high aspire, She rubb'd to dust, in spite. IV Mean while, the clouded sight shone dim; Her sun, through mists, appears; Moist anguish rose, above the brim, And flow'd away, in tears. V O, gnat! too happy, thus, to die! My Celia weeps thy fate; She kills me, ev'ry day—yet, I No pity can create. VI Mysterious sex! by custom, led, Meer trifles, most to prize! O, truth, to turn a lover's head! They murder men, and weep, for flies. The Kiss, through a Window. Sav'd, on a shoal, the ship-wreck'd sailor stands, And views, with watry eyes, and wringing hands, Soul-chearing prospects, from the nieghb'ring lands; But if he tempts the waves, he toils in vain, Big, buoyant billows rise between, and float him back again. Oh! shameful loss of an invited kiss! Can brittle glass impede so near a bliss? Frail is our am'rous hope, if love must be Subservient to a thing, so weak, as thee! We knew, before, nor sought thy aid to prove, That light's a nat'ral enemy to love! But now, thy malice does new arts employ; First, give the hope, then dash the proffer'd joy. Thus, absent fanciers dream, they meet the ghost, Of some dead partner, whom they value most: But when, with op'ning arms, they rush to greet, And, mix'd in mutual grasp, would warmly meet, Cold blasts of wind divide the starting pair, And the thin phantom flows away, in air. Epitaph, on the Tomb of Henry Jernegan, Esq All, that accomplish'd body lends mankind, From earth, receiving, he, to earth resign'd: All, that e'er grac'd a soul, from heav'n, he drew, And took back, with him, as an angel's due. Writ on a Glass Window. Let him, whose present fortune gives him pain, Scorn the low, vulgar custom, to complain: All, that with-holds his wish, the brave will break, Or, silent, bear those chains, 'tis poor, to shake. The Happy Man. High, o'er the winding of a cliffy shore, From whose worn steep, the back'ning surges roar; Freeman—sweet lot! in quiet plenty, lives; Rich, in the unbought wealth, which nature gives; Un-planted groves rise, round his shelter'd seat, And self-sown flow'rs attract his wand'ring feet; Lengths of wild garden his near views adorn, And far-seen fields wave, with domestic corn. The grateful herds, which his own pastures feed, Pay their ask'd lives, and, in due tribute, bleed. Here, in learn'd leisure, he relaxes life, 'Twixt prattling children, and a smiling wife. Here, on dependant want, he sheds his care, Moves, amid smiles, and all, he hears, is pray'r. The world lies round him, like a subject soil, Stor'd, for his service, but, beneath his toil. Hence, in a morning walk, his piercing eye Skims the green ocean, to the circling sky. And marks, at distance, some returning sail, Wing'd, by the courtship of a flatt'ring gale. The fearless crew, concluding danger o'er, With gladd'ning shouts, salute the op'ning shore. They think how, best, they may their gains employ, And antedate thin scenes of promis'd joy. 'Till a near quick-sand checks their shorten'd way, And the sunk masts point thro' the rising spray. Freeman starts, sad! revolves the changeful sight, Where mis'ry can, so soon, succeed delight; Then, shakes his head, in pity of their fate, And sweetly conscious, hugs his happier state. The Power of Royal Pity. Verses, made for a young Gentleman in Despair, and sent to Queen Caroline, by N. C?p?r. From a moist bank, beneath a silent shade, Whose dark'ning arch depending willows made, A death-devoted youth, in day's cool dawn, Weary of insults, and, from woes, withdrawn. Long, on the sullen surface, fix'd his view, And sigh'd—resolv'd to bid loath'd life adieu. 'Tis but to plunge, he cry'd, one moment, there, Saves me from sorrow, and out-leaps despair. Cover'd, with calmness, in this lulling bed, No fear shall reach my heart, no pain, my head: Terror, and shame, and want, shall, with me, die, And anguish be no more alive, than I. Yet, one dear mourner will my death distress, Whom I would live for, could I live, to bless! Her tears are tortures, which I cannot bear; Her charms give madness, and her wants despair. Just, at his word, the dear distruster came: Pierc'd the deep gloom, and catch'd the fatal aim. Trembling, with horror, yet, by love, impell'd, Timely, she grasp'd him; and, convulsive, held: Ah! let me keep thee, tho' we beg, she cry'd; Life has no want, but what's, by love, supply'd: Wretched, with thee, there's recompence, in pain, And bless'd, without thee, I were bless'd, in vain. Hope, suffer, think, resolve, submit, contend: Move every foe—sollicit every friend! Die not, thus young—e'er half our days are past, Love has long years to come: death pulls too fast. I will not feel distress, while you are kind; Nor bear a joyless world, you leave behind. See! be advis'd: turn, there, your hopeless eye, View those sweet rising shades, that spread so nigh. Think, did their royal planter hear my pray'r, How would she pity my poor heart's despair! She, the best wife, best mother, daughter, queen! Ah! that she, now, beheld this dreadful scene! Think on her smiles—and do but live, to try! And, if that hope proves vain—I, too, will die. An Ode; on Occasion of Mr. Handel's great Te Deum, at the Feast of the Sons of the Clergy, on Feb, 1, 1732. I. So David, to the God, who touch'd his lyre, The God, who did, at once inspire The poet's numbers, and the prophet's fire, Taught the wing'd anthems, to aspire! The thoughts of men, in god-like sounds, he sung, And voic'd devotion, for an angel's tongue. At once, with pow'rful words, and skilful air, The priestly king (who knew the weight of pray'r) To his high purpose, match'd his care. To deathless concords, tun'd his mortal lays, And, with a sound, like heav'n's, gave heav'n its praise. II. Where has thy soul, O musick! slept, since then? Or, thro' what lengths of deep creation, led, Has heav'n indulg'd th'all-daring pow'r, to tread? On other globes, to other forms of men, Hast thou been sent, their maker's name to spread? Or, o'er some dying orb, in tuneful dread, Proclaiming judgment, wak'd th' unwilling dead? Or, have new worlds, from wand'ring comets, rais'd, Heard, and leap'd forth, and, into being, blaz'd. III. Say, sacred origin of song! Where hast thou hid thyself so long? Thou soul of Handel, thro' what shining way, Lost to our earth, since David's long-past day, Did'st thou, for all this length of ages, stray! What wond'ring angels hast thou breath'd among, By none of all th' immortal choir, out-sung. IV But, 'tis enough; since thou art here, again; Where thou hast wander'd, gives no pain: We hear, we feel—thou art return'd once more, With musick, mightier than before: As if, in ev'ry orb, From every note of gods, which thou wert shown. Thy spirit did th' harmonious pow'r absorb, And make the moving airs of heav'n, thy own. V. Ah! give thy passport to the nation's pray'r; Ne'er did religion's languid fire Burn fainter—never more require The aid of such a fam'd enliv'ner's care. Thy pow'r can force the stubborn heart, to feel, And rouse the luke-warm doubter into zeal. VI. Teach us to pray, as David pray'd, before; Lift our thanksgiving to th' Almighty's throne, In numbers, like his own, Teach us yet more; Teach us, undying charmer! to compose Our inbred storms, and 'scape impending woes, Lull our wanton hearts to ease; Teach happiness to please; And, since thy notes can ne'er, in vain, implore, Bid 'em be-calm un-resting faction o'er: Inspire content, and peace, in each proud breast; Bid the unwilling land be blest: If aught, we wish for, seems too long to stay, Bid us believe, that heav'n best knows its day: Bid us securely reap the good, we may, Nor tools to other's haughty hopes, throw our own peace away. A SONG. [O that e'er I knew thee! now, no more I woo thee] To the Tune of, I thy bonny Jocky. I O that e'er I knew thee! now, no more I woo thee, Charmer of my soul! I must away, Honour now demands me—love of thee withstands me; Tell me, which of these I must obey? Alas! I would with-hold thee—ever, thus, enfold thee, But I dare not stay thee—no—I yield: Glory, and promotion—call thee o'er the ocean, Go, be brave, and conquer—grace the field. II Stay, thou hasty rover—stay, thou frosty lover; Turn, and ease a heart, that breaks with pain: What, if death should reach thee—go not, I beseech thee; Honour is a cheat—Oh! turn again. Since danger must o'ertake thee—why did nature make thee Sweeter far, than eyes e'er saw before? Man is maid's deceiver—wins her, but to leave her, Never, If I loose thee, smile I more. III Tell me true, sincerely—maids, who love so dearly, But there ne'er was maid, yet, lov'd like me, Tell me, cou'd you lose him?—wou'd you not accuse him? Wou'd you not refuse, to set him free? Shall I, who love his glory—blot his name, from story? Man was made to guard his country's fame. She, who so restrains him—for disgrace, detains him, Shall a love, like his, be paid, with shame? IV Go, my brave alarmer!—go, my daring charmer! Go, and come again, with ten-fold grace: Fight, to bless, and save me—foes shall ne'er enslave me; To no chain, but yours, my pride gives place. Oh! what tender greeting, at our happy meeting, Will our leaping hearts each other give! You, with triumph, blazing—I, with rapture, gazing, Lov'd, and loving long, we both shall live. The Wedding Day. 'Twas one May morning, when the clouds undrawn, Expos'd, in naked charms, the waking dawn; When night-fall'n dews, by day's warm courtship, won, From reeking roses, climb'd, to kiss the sun. Nature, new-blossom'd, shed her odours round; The dew-bent primrose kiss'd the breeze-swept ground. The watchful cock had, thrice, proclaim'd the day, And glimmering sun-beams faintly forc'd their way: When, join'd, in hand, and heart, to church we went, Mutual, in vows, and pris'ners, by consent. Aurelia's heart beat high, with mix'd alarms, But trembling beauty glow'd, with double charms. In her soft breast, a modest struggle rose, How she should seem to like the lot, she chose. A smile, she thought, would dress her looks too gay; A frown might seem too sad, and blast the day: But, while nor this, nor that, her will cou'd bow, She walk'd, and look'd, and charm'd—and knew not how. Our hands, at length, th' unchanging fiat bound, And our glad souls sprung out, to meet the sound. Joys, meeting joys, unite, and stronger shine, For passion, purify'd, grows half divine. Aurelia, thou art mine, I cry'd—and she Sigh'd soft—now, Damon, thou art lord of me. But, wilt thou, whisper'd she, the knot now, ty'd, Which only death's keen weapon can divide, Wilt thou, still mindful of thy raptures past, Permit the summer of love's hope, to last? Shall not cold wint'ry frosts come on too soon? Ah, say! what means the world, by honey moon? If we so short a space our bliss enjoy, What toils does love, for one poor month, employ? Women, thus us'd, like bubbles, blown with air, Owe, to their owtward charms, a sun-guilt glare. Like them, we glitter, to the distant eye; But grasp'd like them, we do but weep and die. Lest more, said I, thou shoud'st profane the bliss, I'll seal thy dang'rous lips, with this close kiss; Not thus, the heav'n of Marriage hopes blaspheme, But learn from me to speak on this lov'd theme. There have been wedlock joys, of swift decay, Like light'ning, seen, at once, and shot away: But theirs were hopes, which, all unfit to pair, Like fire, and powder, kiss'd, and flash'd, to air. Thy soul, and minc, by mutual courtship, won, Meet, like two mingling flames, and make but one. Union of hearts, not hands, does marriage make; 'Tis sympathy of mind keeps love awake. Our growing days increase of joy shall know, And thick-sown comforts leave no room, for woe. Thou, the soft swelling vine, shall fruitful last; I, the strong elm, will prop thy beauties fast: Thou shalt strow sweets, to soften life's rough way, And, when hot passions my proud wishes sway, Thou, like some breeze, shall, in my bosom, play. Thou, for protection, shalt, on me, depend; And I, on thee, for a soft, faithful friend. I, in Aurelia, shall for ever view, At once, my care, my fear, my comfort, too! Thou shalt first partner, in my pleasures, be, But all my pains shall, last, be known to thee. Aurelia heard, and view'd me, with a smile, Which seem'd, at once, to cherish and revile? O, God of Love! she cry'd, what joys were thine, If all life's race were wedding-days, like mine! The Dream. Slow-rising night had her black flag unfurl'd, And spread her sooty mantle o'er the world; The waning moon shed pale, a sickly light, And stars scarce twinkled, to th' enquiring sight. Half the lost earth, by darkness, over-run, Wept, in cold dews, the absence of the sun. The waves were hush'd; the winds forgot to roar, And storms, detach'd, in breezes, cours'd the shoar. The mix'd creation was involv'd in sleep; Fishes roll'd, slumb'ring, thro' the stagnate deep. Beasts, birds, and serpents, various beds possest, Some, in thick woods, some, in dark caverns, rest. Antipathies, in common sleep, took part; Care curs'd not thought, and woe forgot to smart. Immerg'd in rest, my drowsy senses lay, And death's proud image practis'd, on my clay. But while, disdainful of the mean controul, No dull desires invade my wakeful soul; Active, the' inspirer, skilful to pursue, Thro' the wild tracks of mazy mem'ry, flew; There, scatter'd images to union brought, And form'd this wond'rous vision, to my thought: I found myself at dead of deepest night, Chear'd, by no glimm'ring spark of remnant light, Lock'd, in that antient, venerable pile, Which holds her sacred dust, who, lately blest our isle; Ascending damps the gloomy concave sought, And hung, imprison'd, to th' impervious vault: While my shod feet trac'd, swift, the dusky round, Hoarse echoes multiply'd the trampling sound, The sweating stones distill'd a noisome dew, And earthy scents my death-fed nostrils drew. Cold frosts of fear pierc'd, keen, thro' ev'ry part, And shiv'ring agues shook my ice-bound heart. A hollow wind, from whist'ling murmurs, bore Its gath'ring din more high, and strove to roar! The tatter'd trophies fann'd the prison'd air, And chill amazement stiffen'd up my hair. While fix'd, I stood, intent on rumblings near, And distant groans alarm'd my aking ear, Sudden, the temple shone, with rushing light, And new-born terrors overwhelm'd my sight. Ghosts, from the loos'ning pavement, rais'd their head, And yawning graves disclose their shrouded dead. Shot up, in streams, a mist of spirits rise, As morning exhalations streak the skies. Soul-freezing horror tingled through my blood, And curdling fear bound hard the vital flood. Unbending nerves their dying vigour lost, And drooping life scarce held her dang'rous post. Large drops of sweat, from every finger, shed, And the whole frame of nature shook with dread. From the east end, where mould'ring monarchs lie, And worms, luxuriant, feast on royalty; Where each proud tomb some dust of princes boasts, There marches out a troop of sov'reign ghosts: Each, in his shadowy hand, a scepter brings, Th' acknowledg'd mark of pow'r, in living kings. A glitt'ring diadem each forehead wore; Their robes trail'd, loose, and swept the honour'd floor! With slow, and stately stride, the monarchs tread, And ev'ry meaner spirit bows its head. In foremost rank, as latest known to fame, The grave-brow'd ghost of aweful Anna came; Calm, and serene, the silent walks they trace, And halt, regardful, at each solemn place: Visit each tomb, and in mysterious state, Hail the dry remnants of the wasted great. This pomp of death, thus, wore half night away, And came, at length, where Denmark's body lay: There Anna staid, and looking, careful, round, With shadowy scepter, touch'd the conscious ground. 'Tis strange, she sigh'd, that he, whom most I blest, Has never thank'd me, since I came to rest. The willing ghost his marbly fetters broke, And rose up, slowly, at the pow'rful stroke: An air of sorrow bent his serious head, His eyes some seeming tears, reluctant, shed. With folded arms, and discontented look, Thrice bow'd he, gently, and thus, faintly, spoke: Hail, happy shade! rest here, unforc'd to reign, Nor toil, to save a stubborn land, in vain: How did just pity sweeten thy controul! How did'st thou strain thy virtue-propping soul! How did'st thou wish th' unfinish'd course to run! And act, in will, what pow'r has left undone! For this, since death, detraction wounds thy fame, And insolent reproach corrodes thy name. Ungrateful people! un-repenting state! Hast thou, O Queen! deserv'd th' ungentle fate? He ceas'd:—Each list'ning monarch shook his head, While she, to whom he spoke, thus, answ'ring, said: O, Denmark! wonder not at ills, like those; Angels, if crown'd in England, wou'd have foes! Desert, like mine, with living glories paid, Can fear no scandal, when become a shade. If aught's left wanting to my people's pray'r, Mourn not th' unfinish'd progress of my care. When princes some wish'd good, in vain, pursue, By them not done, 'tis left for heav'n to do. Let us, in peace, enjoy our silent bed, Truth always triumphs, when she serves the dead. The Northern Star. Born in an age, when virtue veils her face, And bold corruption turns the blush on grace; Where reptile genius winds, at pow'rs controul, And fortune's whelmy tides engulph the soul: Where sense, by flatt'ry; shame, by want, is weigh'd, And servile poets make their art a trade, Rise, gen'rous muse! out-soar the venal view; For, praise is insult, where 'tis giv'n undue. Tho' pension'd fame can fawn, 'till fools are taught To boast th'imputed wit, their brib'ry bought; Yet, man, to man's respect, is rais'd, not born, And dullness, dignify'd, but doubles scorn. Ah! narrow hearts! that know not wisdom's weight, But, impudently, call the proud, the great. Spread the broad wings of truth, impartial muse! Dare a new theme—nor, now, let fancy chuse. Serious, and sad, the faults of custom mend, To friendless genius fame's due succour lend.— If, in some dusky corner, thou shalt find A ragged fortune hide a noble mind, Disperse the cloud; and be the labour thine, To teach the shame-fac'd virtue, how to shine. Or, should some wealth-encumber'd churl with-hold Th' enliv'ning use of un-partaken gold, If, meanly proud, the wretch disdains to weigh The wise man's wants, against the treasur'd clay, With ceaseless satire, goad his sneaking soul, 'Till his pride, suff'ring, gives his taste controul. Then, muse! from life's low wrongs, indignant, turn, With loftier flame, for suff'ring nations, burn. On flatter'd statesmen, scowl a patriot eye; Strip their badg'd poets, when they write, to lie. If, rais'd by chance, some tarnisher of sway, Blund'ring through shifts, mistakes th' unwinding way, If, lumb'ring clogg'd, he drags, be-mir'd, along, Cow'rs, to be safe—yet, injures, to be strong, Tell him,—that hair-breadth 'scapes, and life-long fear, Buy pow'r, and pomp, and infamy, too dear. Pass, pass, these sulph'ry meteors, of a day; Their blaze too dang'rous! and too lost, their way! On suns, not comets, fix thy eagly ken, Touch the proud hearts of monarchs, into men. Thence, flows contagion: light must generate light, Or mimic millions catch the royal blite: Kings, who are kings, shed lustre o'er mankind; But dim-ey'd princes make whole nations blind. —So, god-like Cæsar rul'd ungrateful Rome, And short-liv'd virtue shot a blasted bloom: But, when lewd Nero stain'd imperial sway, Vice, with a rapid stream, swept shame away. Let the low muse, that strikes the venal strings, Tune her tame lyre, and swell the pomp of kings. Undreading, thou, where'er the censure falls, Enter proud Palaces imperious walls. There,—good, or evil—seize th' unshadow'd fact, And call truth, truth, however princes act. Sublimely fir'd, I snatch the glorious aim! 'Twere great, indeed, to give the royal, fame! But,—where, O spotless light, of reason's eye! Where, among princes, wilt thou greatness spy? Shall Britain's boast o'erload my lab'ring lines? No—with known force, domestic glory shines! Flatt'ry were base: and needless the design, To say, (to angels) heav'n is all divine. Northward, departing muse, extend thy flight; There, a new sun inflames the land of night; There, arts and arms, the worlds fisth empire raise; There, dateless times shall hail my prophet praise: Thy line, great Czar! shall stretch that shorten'd name, To more than Cæsar's pow'r, and all his fame. Taught, by thy plans, to reign, victorious, still, And length'ning down, through time, thy deathless skill, Legions of kings, shall wait their doom-ful nod, As hosts, from Moses, watch'd th' inspiring God! O! pride, celestial, of my muse's praise! Thou! best invok'd!—inspire my rising lays, Kindle my glowing soul, with fires, like thine, And lend me light, to make my off'ring shine! Tho' right to mark, how tow'ring eagles fly, Asks the try'd sharpness of an eagle's eye; Tho' high-rais'd view can, best, a prospect show, Which he but ill describes, who stands too low; Yet, if, aspiring to the theme,—I feel Thy glory's love propel my trembling zeal, O, prince! the grateful arrogance forgive; No genuine muse, so charm'd, can, silent, live. Perish the pride, in poor distinction shewn, That makes man blind, to blessings not his own! Briton and Russian differ, but in name: In nature's sense, all nations are the same. One world, divided, distant brothers share, And man is reason's subject—every where. So, does dark Nile's mysterious torrent stray, And oozy wealth, in annual flood, convey. Memphia's rich plains imbibe th'impregnate flow, And pleas'd Egyptians see proud harvests grow. Yet, while, on Egypt, partial harvests smile, Egypt's glad sons engross not all their Nile. Egypt, and all the world, the river claim: Egypt, in influence, and the world, in fame. So, Russia feels her Czar's intensest heat: But, the warm'd world his distant brightness, greet. Ages, obscurely lost to slighted fame, Robb'd the dim empire of its bury'd name! One city's bounds usurp'd her monarch's rights, And shrunk his thousand states, to Muscovites. Un-measur'd realms lay hid, in noiseless reign, And Russia cover'd half the world in vain! 'Till rip'ning time this giant-genius sent; Divinely siz'd—to suit his crown's extent! He breath'd prolific soul, inspir'd the land, And call'd forth order, with directive hand. Then, pow'r's whole energy, at once, spread wide, And old obstruction sunk, beneath its tide. Then, shad'wing all, the dread dominion rose, Which, late, no hope, and now, no danger knows! Did not, O prince! thy love of art's soft charms Suspend the keener influence of thy arms, Astonish'd Europe, envious of thy sway, Must wink malignant, in thy stream of day! But 'tis thy generous task, to steer thy reign, 'Twixt the two wide extremes, of mean and vain. To teach fierce conq'rors, all, that arts bestow, Yet hold back arms, 'till justice names the foe. Not so, of old, when, stern, in horrid arms, The needy north pour'd forth her Gothic swarms; Roughly, they warr'd, on arts, they could not taste, And, blindly, laid the tracks of learning waste. This heav'n remember'd, and, with kind command, Call'd for atonement, from the barb'rous land. The prince, disdainful of his country's crime, Guiltless, springs forward, to un-curse the clime: And, nobly just, has taught the nations more, Than the world's empire ruin'd—lost, before! How vast the engine!—and the force, how great! That could, so swiftly, move such pond'rous weight! Enormous boast of kings! who,—tho' his reign Stretch'd empire's endless line, from main to main, Counts not his greatness, by his country's length, Nor from dependent millions, steals his strength, But, to himself (like heav'n) his effluence owes, And gives—not takes—what pow'r from number flows. Born, for eternal growth—and stor'd with schemes, For whit'ning time, with ever-blooming themes. Wonders on wonders gild a glowing land, That, almost, ow'd distinction to his hand! From frozen climes, where nature, stiff with cold, Nourish'd no hope; and time in tears grew old: Warm'd by the monarch's worth, we rising saw Springs of gay virtue—and ripe fruits of law! Doubly supreme! Thy unrestrain'd controul Directs the body, and impow'rs the soul! While vulgar kings their views supinely scan, And limit what they would, by what they can, Thy nobler pow'r, with more than mortal sway, Commands—and makes men able, to obey! Transporting thought!—let me indulge it long, Hence, realms grow mighty, and their influence strong. Ah! why, by civil broils, should patriots bleed, For parts in pow'r, they nor enjoy, nor need? Less factious subjects happier freedom share; Mis-reckon'd slaves, in such a sov'reign's care. Slaves are blind bust'lers, who, deceiv'd by names, Promote, unknowingly, their spoiler's aims: Who (told, sedition sets a nation free) Hug the new chain—and call it liberty. Then—walking gall'd, beneath th' incumbent weight, Grind a curb'd curse, and bear th' impos'd deceit. If just Athenians, by a Theseus, led, Their scatter'd country's strength-uniting head! To lasting praise, consign'd his cherish'd fame, And, conscious of his bounty, bless'd his name; If hard Lycurgus, now, immortal grown, Sheds deathless glory round a realmless throne: If, Romulus! thy mem'ry triumps, still, For teaching Rome to rob, with safer skill; For reining rapine in, from private harms, To mightier mischief, in confed'rate arms: What praise, prodigious Czar! shall dare to tread, In aweful circles, near thy sacred head? To whom, not one small portion, singly, kneels, In thanks for sep'rate benefits, it feels: But nations, numberless, as Lybian sands, Share the long bounties of thy reaching hands— Thy hands! to whom, delighted with thy praise, God gave not thrones, to reign on—but to raise. Thy catching lustre fires the north's wide soul; And thaws the icy influence of the pole. The shaggy Samoid, shaking off his snow, Warms his cold breast, with new desire, to know. The rugged Tartar, from whose swarthy bands A gloom of horror us'd to shade thy lands, Charm'd, by thy gen'rous daring, checks his own, Assumes new nature, and adorns thy throne. Beams of young learning, active as the wind, Radiant, flame out, and light up half mankind: Stern superstition's misty cloud, dispell'd, Quits her chief throne, through long, dark, ages, held: And Russian arms glitt'ring terror cast, O'er realms, where scarce the Russian name had past! Blush, ye bought bards! of our degen'rate days, Whom pension prostitutes, to high-way praise: Who fear it fruitless, for a muse to roam, Thence, poorly, pin your venal hearts, at home! The world's my country: born, no matter where, Man is a denizen of earth and air. Native to truth, 'tis his, all worth, to show, And love the hostile virtues of a foe. Ah! how too weak my willing verse pursues, And flags, beneath new heights, of op'ning views! Touch my charm'd heart, thou! God! that did'st inspire His force! and let me feel th' impulsive fire. Sunk, amid fens, in fortune's stagnate tract, And curs'd myself, with want of pow'r, to act, Let me, at least describe, with conscious blaze, And, from another's triumph, force some praise. O! great, eternal pow'r, that bounds our minds, What circling darkness human foresight, blinds! Where are the lost effects of statesmen's dreams? Whose erring envy spun such cobweb schemes! Long—each vain terror beat one devious road; And sigh'd, at growing France, with false forebode: While, un-observ'd, th' exulting northern bear Grin'd over gen'ral empire, rising, there. Henceforth, let none the strength of states compare: Nor what they may be, judge, from what they are. Low the lord's genius, all his realms the same: The king's breast wid'ning, swells his throne to fame. Then, pow'r effulging, distanc'd equals find, That man's whole, boundless, diff'rence dwells in Mind. This truth,—dread dark'ner of each rival throne! Well has thy life's long tract of wonders shown; What sudden fleets have shadow'd distant seas, With flags, that start to pow'r, and scorn degrees; Glooming at pleasure, ev'ry hostile shore, Far-trembling nations hear new thunders roar; Th' intrepid Swede does fortune's change upbraid, And sees th' assaulted enemy invade! The Dane finds gratitude too weak for fear, And hates his helper's strength, display'd too near. The furrow'd Baltic a new lord obeys, And to strange keels, reluctant homage pays. The virgin Caspian, he, bold lover! woos; Nor vainly, for her envy'd favour sues: Grasp'd to his wish, she has her love confess'd, And giv'n him leave to wander o'er her breast. Persia's heap'd wealth shall her huge portion be, And India's sovereigns give her lord the knee. From nameless outlets, endless naval hosts, Black'ning, still more, the sable Euxine's coasts, Shall teach the Porte's imperial walls to shake, And the fell sultan's iron scepter break. Grecia's lost soul shall be restor'd, by thee! Great saver! setting empire's genius free! Then, Hellespont, whose stream indignant glides, And a subjected world's two bounds divides; Shall feel, while reaching both, thy thunder roars, Europe and Asia, trembling, to her shores. Then, may thy floating empire's conq'ring sweep New-greet vast Russia, round th' Atlantic deep. So, spring the seeds of pow'r, when wisely sown! So, pregnant genius plans the future throne! Mean while, great founder! gath'ring strength, from blows, They spread thy glory, who thy arms oppose. The self-priz'd lords of China's boastful land, Feel their pride shrink, beneath thy bord'ring hand! The trackless wilds, which both vast states disjoin, Are, ev'n when arm'd with shiv'ring winter, thine! O'er realms of snow, thy furry squadrons fly: And bring, at ease, the dreadful distance nigh! In vain oppos'd, th' enormous Wall they see; Proclaim'd defiance can but quicken Thee. ZEMBLA's white cliffs—eternal hoards of frost, Where proud discov'ry has, so oft, been lost; Thro' every period of the world, 'till now, Have check'd all keels, that would those oceans plow: Nature's last barrier! they all search withstood, And bound ambition up, in freezing blood. Reserv'd, by heav'n, and, for thy reign, design'd, Thy piercing eye shall that dark passage find. Or, east's and west's embracing confines, shown, Join two emerging worlds; and both, thy own. Stop, headlong muse!—Ah! whither woud'st thou go? Look down, with caution, on the depths below: Prospects, too vast, the rash presumer fright; And, dazzling, wound an uncollected sight. Congratulate, a while, our church's gain, And, mingling joy, relax thy wonder's strain. Shall, then, at last, beneath propitious skies, The cross, triumphant, o'er the crescent rise? Shall we behold earth's long-sustain'd disgrace Reveng'd, in arms, on Osman's haughty race? Shall christian Greece shake off a captive's shame, And look, un-blushing, at her pagan fame? 'Twill be.—Prophetic Delphos claims her own: Hails her new Cæsars on the Russian throne. Athens shall teach, once more! once more, aspire! And Spartan breasts re-glow, with martial fire: Still, still, Bizantium's bright'ning domes shall shine, And rear the ruin'd name of Constantine. Transcendent prince! how happy must thou be! What can'st thou look upon, unbless'd, by thee? What inward peace must that calm bosom know, Whence conscious virtue does so strongly flow! Each fame, of ages past, in ruins lies: How timely, therefore, does thy greatness rise, To fire forgetful thrones, with thirst of praise; And build example, for these feeble days! Such, are the kings, who make God's image shine, Nor blush to dare assert their right divine! No earth-born byas warps their climbing will; No pride, their pow'r—no av'rice whets their skill. They poise each hope, which bids the wise obey, And shed broad blessings, from their wid'ning sway. To raise th' afflicted, stretch the healing hand, Drive crush'd oppression from each rescu'd land. Bold in alternate right, or sheathe, or draw, The sword of conquest, or the sword of law. Spare, what resists not; what opposes, bend; And govern, cool, what they, with warmth, defend. How bless'd were man! would heav'n, hereafter, please, That all earth's princes should be form'd like these! Wish it, O muse! howe'er the wish be vain; It gives some joy, to hope th' unlikeliest gain. Adieu—dread flame! that bids the pole outshine The torrid brightness of the burning line! Drawn by thy beamy force, I still would gaze: But my eyes ake beneath the' oppressive blaze. Descend, rash muse!—'tis decent to retire; Thy fall were dang'rous, if thy flight were higher. Thou, too, great prince! forbear th' ador'd excess! Rest—for thy life: and make thy glory less. Heav'n must reclaim thee—nor thy absence bear, When earth yields no new wonder, worth thy care. Mourn'd, the near prospect! yet not mourn'd by all! There are, whose humbler glory waits thy fall. When thou, great sun of royalty! shalt set, And pay sad nature's last and surest debt: Then, earth's low lords may boast their poor designs, And ev'ry upstart twinkler think—he shines. Then, when no more thy wonders wake mankind, But dying envy leaves delight behind, Here, while thy steps admiring ages trace, Where shall amazement, first, encomium place? Arduous decision! which most honour won? Thy actions, or the speed, with which they're done. When Rome, that glitt'ring, that immortal name! Aspir'd to rule, and panted after fame; Age copying age, spun length of patient will, And ek'd th' oft-breaking thread, with lab'ring skill. Nor, 'till sev'n hundred hard-press'd years were past, The late propitious fortune smil'd at last. Not such slow rise, O prince! thy Russia fears: Thou dragg'st not glory from such depth of years. At once resolv'd, at once, the columns rise, Which lift thy dreadful fabrick to the skies. Form and degrees, let bounded spirits need: Thy soul, excentric, moves with in-bred speed! Makes nature shake, and raises, in a day, What, with less ease, in ages, shall decay. So, when young Time its first great birth-day kept, And huddled nature, yet, in chaos slept; Th' eternal Word, to set distinction free, But spoke th' almighty fiat—Let there be. Millions of ways, the starting atoms flew; Like clung to like—and sudden order grew: Struggling in clouds, a while, confusion lay, Then died, at once, and lost itself in day. The Picture of Love. Love is a passion, by no rules confin'd, The great first mover of the human mind: Spring of our fate! it lifts the climbing will, Or sinks the soften'd soul, in seas of ill: Science, truth, virtue, sweetness, glory, grace, All are love's influence, and adorn his race; Love, too, gives fear, despair, grief, anger, strife, And all th' unnumber'd woes, which tempest life, Fir'd with a daring wish, to paint him right, What muse shall I invoke to lend me light? Something divine there lives in love's soft flame, Beyond our spirit's pow'r, to give it name! How shall I paint it, then? or why reveal A pleasure, and a pain, which all must feel? Soul of thy sex's sweetness! aid my hope, Pride of my reason, and my passion's scope! Thou, whose least motion can delight inspire! And whose sweet eye-beams shed celestial fire! Thou, at whose heav'n-tun'd voice the dead might wake! And from whose face we fatal learning take, Teach me thy god-like pow'r the heart to move, Smile on my verse, and look the world to love. Far, ye profane, from my chaste subject, fly, Nor stain its brightness with a tainted eye; What if a thousand ills the wanton prove, Whose earth-born heat usurps the name of love? Lovers, indeed, are cast in no coarse mould, How few have, yet, been form'd, though time's grown old! No wild desire can this proud bliss bestow, Souls must be match'd, in heav'n, tho' mix'd, below. As fire, by nature, climbs direct, and bright, And beams, in spotless rays, a shining light; But if some gross obstruction stops its way, Smokes in low curls, and scents the sullied day: So love, itself, untainted, and refin'd, Borrows a tincture, from the colour'd mind; The great grow greater, while its force they prove, But little hearts want room, and cripple love. Cautious, ye fated, who frequent the fair! Your breasts examine, nor too rashly dare, Curb your untrusted hearts, while yet, they're free, Love is resistless, when you feel, 'tis he. Small is the soul's first wound, from beauty's dart, And scarce th' unheeded fever warms the heart. Long we mistake it, under liking's name, A soft indulgence, that deserves no blame; A pleasure, we but take, to do her right, Whose presence charms us, and whose words delight; Whose sweet remembrance broods upon our breast, And whose dear friendship is, with pride, possest. Excited, thus, the smother'd fire, at length, Bursts into blaze, and burns, with open strength: That image, which, before, but sooth'd the mind, Now lords it there, and rages, unconfin'd. Mixing with all our thoughts it wastes the day, And when night comes, it dreams the soul away. Pungent impatience tingles in each vein, And the sick bosom throbs, with aking pain. Absent from her, in whom alone, we live, Life grows a bankrupt, and no bliss can give; Friends are importunate, and pleasure's lost, What, once, most charm'd us, now, disgusts us most; Fretful, to silent solitude, we run, And men, and light, and noisy converse shun; Pensive, in woods, on river's sides, we walk, And to th' unlist'ning winds, and waters, talk; How, next, we shall approach her, pleas'd, we weigh, And think, in transport, all, we mean to say: Tenderly bowing, thus, will we complain, Thus, court her pity, and, thus, plead our pain; Thus, sigh at fancy'd frowns, if frowns shou'd rise, And, thus, meet favours, in her soft'ning eyes. Restless, on paper, we our vows repeat, And pour our souls out, on the missive sheet: Write; blot; restore—and, in lost pieces, rend, The mute entreaters, yet, too faint, to send; Unbless'd, if no admission we procure, 'Tis heav'n, at distance, to behold her door! Or, to her window, we, by night, repair, And let loose fancy, to be feasted, there; Watch her lov'd shadow, as it glances by, And, to imagin'd motions, chain our eye; Has she some field, or grove, or garden bless'd? Pleas'd, we re-tread the paths, her feet have press'd: Near her, by chance, at visits, or at plays, Our rushing spirits crowd, in speaking gaze; Light, on her varied airs, our eye-balls ride, Blind, as the dead, to the full world, beside. If bless'd, by some kind letter, from her hand, The cherish'd flame is into madness, fann'd; Trembling, we half devour the sacred prize, And lend our thoughts, and lips, to aid our eyes; No wild extravagance of joy's too much, For aught once warm'd, by her enliv'ning touch. These are the sweet effusions of desire, When absence wounds us, or when wishes fire; But when, in presence, we our vows address, Who can the tumults of the soul express? Boundless desire, aw'd hope, and doubtful joy, Stormy, by turns, the veering heart employ; Sick'ning, in fancy's sun-shine, now, we faint, And licence wounds us deeper, than restraint: Fix'd, in her op'ning door, surpriz'd, we stay, Dumb, and depriv'd of all, we meant to say: Our eyes flash meanings, but our rooted feet Pause, 'till due rev'rence saints the hallow'd heat: Soft tremblings seize us, and a gentle dread, Speechless our thought, and all our couragefled. Slowly reviving, we, from love's short trance, Softly, with blushful tenderness, advance; Bowing, we kneel; and her giv'n hand is prest, With sweet compulsion, to our bounding breast; O'er it, in exstacy, our lips bend low, And tides of sighs, 'twixt her grasp'd fingers, flow: High beats the hurried pulse, at each forc'd kiss, And ev'ry burning sinew akes, with bliss: Life, in a souly deluge rushes o'er, And the charm'd heart springs out, at ev'ry pore. The first fierce rapture of amazement past, Confusion quits us, and desire grows fast; We sit; and while her gaz'd-at beauties rise, A humid brightness sparkles, from our eyes: Modest disquiet ev'ry action wears, And each long look the mark of passion bears; Disorder'd nature no cold medium keeps, Transport now reigns, and dull reflection sleeps: All, that we feel, or wish, or act, or say, Is above thought, and out of reason's way; Joy murmurs, anger laughs, and hope looks sad; Rashness grows prudent, and discretion mad: Restless, we feel our am'rous bosom burn, Now, this way, look we, and, now, that way, turn. Now, in sweet swell of thought, our lifted eyes, Lose their low languor, and attempt to rise; Now, sinking, suppliant, seek the charmer's feet, And court wish'd pity, in their glanc'd retreat, Oft, in fix'd gaze, they dwell upon her face, Then start, astonish'd, from some dazzling grace; Now, in bold liberty, fly out, un-bid, Now, aw'd, 'scape inward, 'twixt the closing lid. If we dare speak, and would our wish pursue, The words fall feath'ry, like descending dew; The soft'ning accents, ev'n in utt'rance die, And the tongue's sweetness, here, out-charms the eye; 'Till mingled sighs the fainting voice confound, But lover's meanings speak, tho' robb'd of sound. Is there no more? oh! yet, the last remains! Crown of our conquest! sweet'ner of our pains! There is a time, when love no wish denies, And smiling nature throws off all disguise; But who can words, to speak those raptures find? Vast sea of exstacy, that drowns the mind! That fierce transfusion of exchanging hearts! That gliding glimpse of heav'n, in pulsive starts! That veiny rush! that warm, tumultuous roll! That fire, which kindles body into soul! And on life's margin strains delight so high, That sense breaks short, and, while we taste, we die. By love's soft force, all nature is refin'd, The dull made sprightly, and the cruel, kind: Gently, the stubborn passions learn to move, And savage hearts are humaniz'd, by love: Love, in a chain of converse, bound mankind, And polish'd, and awak'd the rugged mind: Justice, truth, pity, openness of heart, Courage, politeness, eloquence, and art, That gen'rous fire, with which ambition flames, And all th' unsleeping soul's divinest aims, Touch'd, by the warmth of love, burn up more bright, Proud of the god-like pow'r, to give delight. Thus have I vainly strove, with strokes too faint, Love, in his known, and outward marks, to paint; Unmindful, that, of old, they veil'd his face, And wisely cover'd, what they could not trace. Lovely creator of my soul's soft pain, Pity the pencil, that aspir'd in vain: Vers'd in love's pangs, and taught his pow'r, by you, Skill'd, I presum'd, that what I felt, I drew; But I have err'd; and, with delirious aim, Would picture motion, and imprison flame. He, who can light'ning's flash, to colours, bind, May paint love's influence, on the burning mind. Then, when we master him, and give him law, Then may we chain him, and his image draw: But who would bind this god, must, captive take, A power, which all mankind can captive make; I am too weak of heart; yet, I can tell Those, who dare seize him, where he loves to dwell. I see him now; in his own heav'n, he lies, Close at sweet ambush, in Miranda's eyes. Advice to the Poets. Too long provok'd, immortal muse! forgive; Rouse a dead world, and teach my verse to live. Not the low muse, who lends her feeble fire, To flush pale spleen, or light up loose desire; But that bright influence, that expansive glow, Which, first, in angel's numbers learnt to flow; E're time had struck eternity, with shade, Or day, or night, or space, or form, was made: Tun'd the rais'd notes, at which Creation grew; And worlds, and stars, and suns, and heav'ns, shot new. She, she, the muse—Oh! ne'er to be defin'd; Thou flame of purpose! and thou flow of mind! Thou path of praise, by heav'n's first fav'rites, trod, Thou voice of prophets, and thou breath of God! I feel her now—th' invader fires my breast; And my soul swells, to suit the heav'nly guest; Hear her, O Pope! she sounds th' inspir'd decree, Thou great arch-angel of wit's heav'n! for thee. Let vulgar genii, sow'r'd, by sharp disdain, Pique'd, and malignant, words low war maintain, While ev'ry meaner art exerts her aim, O'er rival arts, to lift her question'd fame, Let half-soul'd poets, still, on poets fall, And teach the willing world to scorn them all. But, let no muse, pre-eminent as thine, Of voice melodious, and of force divine, Stung, by wit's wasps, all rights of rank forego, And turn, and snarl, and bite, at every foe. No—like thy own Ulysses, make no stay; Shun monsters, and pursue thy streamy way. Wing'd, by the muse's god, to rise, sublime, What has thy fame to fear, from peevish rhime? Shalt thou, decreed, 'till time's own death, to live, Yet want the noblest courage—to forgive? Slander'd, in vain, enjoy the spleen of foes; Let these, from envy, hate; from int'rest, those! Guilt, like the first, your gratitude requires; Since none can envy, 'till he, first, admires: And nature tells the last, his crime is none, Who, to your int'rest, but prefers his own. Disgrac'd, by vict'ry, where we strike too low, And, meanly furious, stretch the stooping blow, Pride, that provokes revenge, misleads it, too; Return of slander is the weak man's view: The Wise expect it, with a cold disdain; And, while they not receive, retort the pain. Shou'd ev'n hot rashness erring javelins throw, And strike our friendly breast, suppos'd a foe? How nobler, still, to undeceive, than blame! And chasten insult, with the blush of shame? Never, ah! never, shall that worth be found; Which neither malice, nor mistake, can wound. Thus far, might ev'ry strength of heart extend; Thus far, can ethic springs our tempers bend: Thus far, the thoughts of saints, or kings, may rise, And each known greatness, of earth's usual size: But, far more tow'ring, still, the poet's fires! Whose breast, a ray, from God's own heart, inspires. Heroes, and saints, rise, rare—yet, still, they rise; And time's full stream, each common art supplies. Philosophy's proud heights are hourly gain'd, And painting's charms, and musick's force attain'd: But, when the deathless Poet is to shine, Long-lab'ring ages swell the slow design. At length, he comes: the birth of time appears! And heav'n smiles, satisfy'd, a thousand years. Strange greatness, this! with which compar'd, priest, saint, King, hero, and philosopher, sound faint! He's none of these, whom time shall poet call, But more than either, and creates them all. Learn, poets, learn, th' importance of your name; And, conscious of your pow'r, exalt your aim. Soul-shaking sov'reigns of the passions, you Hold wider empire, than the Cæsars knew. While clam'rous rhet'ric but suspends the mind, And whisp'ring morals sigh, unheard, behind; While frail philosophy but starts designs, And revelation's light too distant shines, Ardent, and close, the muse maintains her sway, And the consenting wishes make her way: E'vn pride's rash plunge, the poet's curb endures; And ev'ry passage to the heart, is yours. Scorn, then, the servile imitators name, Nor, humbly splendid, wear cast coats of fame: Lean not, sustain'd—a weight, no muse allows! Pilf'ring the faded bays, from classic brows; Nor creep, contented, in the modern way; A dry, dull, soft, low, languid, tiresome lay! But, strongly sacred, and sublimely warm, Strike the aw'd soul, and the touch'd passions charm: 'Till the stern cynic, soft'ning at your strain, Feels himself mov'd, and hugs the pleasing pain. While lazy lovers, from their languor, start, And gain a conquest, tho' they lost a heart. Such wond'rous change can harmony command! For heav'n lent nature to the poet's hand; Gave him, the passion's boundless pow'r to know; And, like a god, distribute joy and woe: Taught the tun'd nerves, at each known sound, to spring, And bound, obedient, to the warbling string: Bad the blood's current, in compliance, roll; And the charm'd spirits rush, in tides of soul. Ye, who feel, strong, this pow'r, that heav'n has lent, Be your rais'd hearts, with equal ardour, bent: Dare to praise virtue, tho' unprais'd, before; Lance your keen satires at oppressive pow'r: Be worth, obscure, by your bright genius, sought, And gild its paleness, in your sun of thought: Lift it to notice; give it strength to move, And teach dull greatness, how to know and love. With nerves of thought, invig'rate manly themes; Nor, idly, sport, in fancy's empty beams; Let no base flatt'ry tempt your verse astray, Nor a light laughter a low taste display. In wit's cold shallows wade, for shame! no more, Her soundless ocean tempts you, from the shore: Up her vast steeps, launch, with intrepid climb, And swim, thro' ages, down the stream of time. Tho' faint, thro' modish mists, religion shines, Oft, let her sacred soarings lift your lines: Oft, let your thoughts take fire, at that first flame, From whose bright effluence inspiration came. Th' almighty god, who gave the sun to blaze, Voic'd the great poet, for his maker's praise: First, for his glory, form'd the world's extent; Then, form'd a language, for that glory, meant. Hence, have all tow'ry minds, sublimely fir'd, With in-born strength, to their own heav'n aspir'd; While conscious pertness, for such heights unfit, Safe, to slight subjects, pins its puny wit. Lives there a man, whose breast, with honour, glows? Who, wrong'd, by friends, forgives, and pities, foes; Who, still deserving, never gains success, But lives, oppress'd, by shunning to oppress? Who can all grief, for his own woes, restrain, Yet melts, in gen'rous tears, at other's pain? Teach him, O muse! to wish no monarch's sway, Greater, in want, than, in dominion, they! For, oh!—what diff'rence! 'twixt th' effulgent mind, That longs for light, lest others should be blind, And him, who, wanting nothing, grasping all, Seems great, himself, because all, round, look small! Or, does a softer subject suit your mind? Fond of the fair, and, to their int'rest, kind; Pity some maid, whom modest wishes move, Unbless'd, by fortune, yet inspir'd, by love; Fair, without followers, without art, sincere, Prais'd, without hope, and, without conquest, dear: There, let the muse, the rights of beauty prove, For all are equal, by the laws of love. There let the muse perswade, on virtue's side, And teach lame love to leap the bars of pride: The pains of passion let the muse impart, And, to soft yieldings, mould the stubborn heart. Are there, whose rais'd distinction sweetly shines, And whom high fortune fill's with high designs? Who, greatly blessing all, o'er whom they rise, Smile on th' inferior world, with friendly eyes Or, whom the love of useful arts inspires? Or, whom faith, gratitude, or friendship, fires? Or, whom, by Charity's soft glowings, warm'd, All vice has fled from, and all virtue charm'd? These, and all these, deserve the muse's strain; At once, adorn, and are adorn'd, again. Shines there a captain, form'd, for war's controul, Born, with the seeds of conquest, in his soul? By envy, driv'n to trust his in-bred store, And, still, the less supply'd, renown'd the more? 'Gainst foes, and friends, at once, compelld to guard, But hardest press'd, by those, for whom, he warr'd; Victor, alike, supported, or betray'd, And obstinate, in his oppressor's aid; Pointing, superior, from the heights, he won, To teach his rash supplanters what to shun. Disclaiming vengeance, while secure of fame, And griev'd, not angry, at his country's shame: Fearless of flatt'ry, here, confess the great, And, to wrong'd glory, lend the muses weight. To crowns, and senates, hold a daring light, And, 'spite of M?'s, do a M? right. Should wit's high guardians e'er their charge neglect, Nor watch her waning, nor her growth protect, Cold, and unmov'd, see tragic warmth decay, And epic splendor fade, unfelt, away; While, in their place, low tastes the land defame, Jests, without words; and laughter, without shame! Poets expell'd the stage, supremely theirs, And the bays with'ring, round the heads of play'rs; Then should the muse, indignant, wake the throne, And the whole thunder of her voice be shown. O! that all verse would senseless sound expel, And the big subject bid the numbers swell! But, ah! far short th' unsolid tinklers rise; Nor soar, but flutter, in the muse's skies. Shame on your jingling, ye soft sons of rhyme! Tuneful consumers of your reader's time! Fancy's light dwarfs! whose feather-footed strains, Dance, in wild windings, thro' a waste of brains! Yours is the guilt of all, who, judging wrong, Mistake tun'd nonsense, for the poet's song. Provoking dulness! what a soul has he, Who fancies rhyme, and measure, Poetry! He thinks, profanely, that this gen'rous art Stops, at the ear, with pow'r to shake the heart. For twice nine cent'ries, why has partial fame, O'er worthier Romans, swell'd th' Augustan name? O'er Julius, nobler, and of mightier mind? O'er ev'n Vespasian, darling of mankind? What, but the muse, this lasting diff'rence made? Pleas'd poets lent the world's great lord their aid: And, from their grateful praise, consent first grew, That he, who rais'd the arts, surpass'd them, too. Think, ye vain statesmen! whose self-pointed aims Die, with your dust, nor save your bury'd names, Think, on the crowds of busy cyphers, lost, Who, once, like you, their sov'reign's smiles engross'd! Cloudily, bustling, fill'd a realm, alone, And, with state curtains, skreen'd the darken'd throne: 'Twixt crown, and subject, stood an envy'd wall, Bought, built, clear'd, clouded, and decided all: Yet, dead for ever, in dumb graves are laid, And rest, forgotten, with the noise they made. No Richelieu's they—nor knew the poet's pow'r, Nor, skill'd to plant, invok'd the genial show'r: Hence, their dry names, in happy haste, decay, And ev'ry barren glory fades away. In peace, such themes demand the poet's fire, Such subjects raise th' exalted art, still higher: But, if provok'd too far, some wav'ring state, Push'd, and insulted, in perplex'd debate, Feels her slow patience blush,—and, tir'd, at length, Weighs her mean wrongs, against her mighty strength; If, then, wish'd War th'exerted genius warms, And glowing verse would rouse a realm to arms, Then, the joint muses animate the song, And the whole godhead pours the sound along: Then, the big notes, in tun'd excitement, roll, Bid the blood boil, and wing the wafted soul: Courage, impatient, burns in ev'ry breath; And a taught brav'ry leaps the lines of death. These are the seasons, O, ye muse-inspir'd! When states, unwarlike, may, to war, be fir'd; Then, pow'rful verse should long-lost heroes raise, And kindle glory, at the catching blaze: Arthur's great ghost, unresting, and asham'd, That William's brav'ry saw the brave defam'd, Shining, redeem'd, in honour of our land, Wou'd smile, to 'scape the knighted tort'rers hand, Then, might our great, third Edward's aweful shade, Hem'd with ris'n standards, dreadfully display'd, Pale, from his tomb, in epic strides, advance; And shoot cold horror thro' the heart of France. Wide, o'er the reading world, extend alarms, And warn proud states to shun Britannia's arms. Or, since the muses sons, in courts, are known, And, pleas'd, pay homage, round a reigning throne, Why are they slow, to sing the saxon fame? From whose long lineage, sov'reign Brunswic came: When their White Courser, by brave Hengist born, Did, first, in Albion, war's wav'd pomp adorn: While German aids thy cliffs, O Britain! scal'd, To triumph, where ev'n Rome's great help had fail'd! To save, and give forgetful England Name; To plant a race, that know not whence they came: To lend us language, to express our fires, In grateful railings, at our German sires. Thus, O ye hapyy few,! for glory, born, Whose starry wreathes your country's fame adorn, Waste not, on vulgar themes, your breathing fire, But tune, for gen'rous ends, your living lyre: Teach the mistaken world a juster rate, To court your praises, and to dread your hate. Then, when kind heav'n inspires the vast sublime, And your verse lives, and claims the stamp of time, Hist'ry shall die, and scarce preserve a name; While poets flourish, in immortal fame. How have endanger'd ballancers of state Liv'd, in light ign'rance of the muse's weight? How might a guided stage men's wills prepare, To brook tame Peace, or wish reluctant War! How might the subtle scene our passions wind! And the watch'd arms of young sedition bind! How timely might this pow'rful art persuade! How make light lovelier, and illumine shade! Ease statesmen's labours, animate their aims, Adorn their actions, and embalm their names! Shou'd W?'s self, unconscious of the muse, Provoke her vengeance, or her rev'rence lose, In vain were votes! she could his pow'r defy, And bid his blacken'd mem'ry never die: Shade his best virtues, widen each mistake, And his hop'd fame, from unborn ages take. Or, she could force unwilling praise to climb, And float him, topmost, on the tide of time; Bid millions bless him, ages after death, And give new life, in a charm'd people's breath: When no skill'd antiquary finds his bust, And his proud buildings shall be lost, in dust. Pardon, ye living lights! where-e'er you shine, Ye, blest elect! ye prophets, of the nine! Pardon, that I, whom fainter flames inspire, Have, thus, presum'd to point your heav'nly fire: To make the great more great, requires your skill; I want the pow'r, nor ev'n possess the will. While to myself, I live, obscurely bless'd, Look round the busy world, and hug my rest; Plac'd below greatness, and above distress, I pity pow'r, and hold fast happiness: Pursue no int'rest, no mean prospect raise; Reject no censure, and invite no praise. The Impartial. Are these the marks, then, of our promis'd shame! Or did detraction steal the patriot's name? Weak, if we were, how rose we, now, so strong? Or whence, if pow'rful, were we scorn'd, so long? Burn, sooty slander, burn thy blotted scroll: Greatness is greatness, 'spite of faction's soul. I gaze, astonish'd kingdom, o'er thy face, And each weigh'd wonder, to its fountain, trace. Glory flows in, where infamy was spread: And long-lost triumph lifts her tow'ring head. Warm, o'er the icy north, thy influent awe Bids hostile leagues dissolve, in friendly thaw. Up Rhine's strong stream, Britannic thunders wind, And Alpine mountains shake, and states, behind. Austria's plum'd eagle, beak'd, and wing'd, once more, Sees baffled Bourbon driv'n, from shore, to shore. Sea-shook Ausonia, red, with warring hosts, Starts, from her Adrian, to her Tyrrhene coasts. Ev'n Rome's imperious mitre learns to bow, And Spain's Thalestris is but woman, now! Whence this, amazing change?—'twas, late, all, fear: No warring god, invok'd, inclin'd his ear. Tyrants, combin'd, found freedom's rights betray'd: Faith, fast-expiring, saw the false invade, Commerce cajol'd, reluctance brib'd, rage tame: Ev'n empire trod on—yet, untouch'd, by shame! Then was the crisis; then, fate's hand appear'd: Then, might the world be deaf, for Britain heard. Wave-worship'd Britain! one, to all, oppos'd! By friends, deserted, and, by foes, inclos'd, Fills the world's eye, dispels the doubter's care; Bids the bold tremble, and the backward dare: High, to the nations, points their guardian's throne, And acts, and arbitrates, and shines, alone. And have such fires inflam'd a patient reign? Immortal heav'n! and must we, still, complain? Still, must we rail, and blacken, and suspect? At once, curb vigilance, and goad neglect? Deep let my soul detest th' adhesive pride, That, changing sentiment, unchanges side: True, to contempt of truth, repents, within, Yet, screens conviction, and strains hard, to sin. Shame on this craft, to scare!—this toil, to seem! O heart, indignant, fly th' unmanly scheme; Blush, for thy past injustice; shrink no more; But wake, and wonder, thou wert dark, before! Learn, from whose hand th' unlook'd-for effluence came; And, in the teeth of insult, sound his name. What, tho' some friend, thou lov'st, had narrower sight? Truth knows no parties, and involves, like light. Shadows, and names fright cowards—but the strong Ne'er call that lightness, which is scorn of wrong. Dare to be just, 'tis all that brav'ry means; He stoops too basely, who, to flatt'ry, leans: But, whom pale prejudice has taught his part, Born, for a slave, wears fetters, on his heart; Sees, undiscerning; feels, without his touch: Judges, too little, and decides too much. Poets have nobler souls: fame's paths they show; They glow themselves, and teach the world, to glow. Satire's whole pow'r their own—yet, praise they chuse, Ev'n of unconscious kings, who slight the muse. Proud of neglected force, each heav'n-touch'd mind, Open, to reason, is, to int'rest, blind. Self, all unthought of, can, for others, think: Swim, 'till the state rides safe, then, smile, and sink. Lift, ev'n the worth that hates him; love it shown; And, for his country's joys, exclude his own, This is to think, like muses, act, like Man: This Princes ought to feel—and poets can. Ye, once misguided! is retraction vain? Trust the brave injur'd: nor persist to stain. Why should suspicion penitence out-live? None doubt forgiveness, but who ne'er forgive. Heav'n has been wrong'd, yet, still, goes on, to bless; For sins of blindness err, beneath distress. So wrong'd, so pard'ning, Cart'ret heeds no foe; But saves—unangry, at the rage below. Off, with these shackly quoils, of twin'd intrigue; These nets for liberty, these links of league. Trite, venal, cant! which envy's arts can teach To censure ev'ry pow'r, we fail to reach. No gen'rous heart, misdrawn to devious beat, When truth's new lustre shines, disclaims its heat. Charm'd, and surpriz'd, I hug my country's fame; Compar'd, O heav'n! with years of length'ning shame. Ye sons, who love her, weigh the threat'ning swell, Of Spain, France, faction, calumny, and hell! Weigh, with what speed, repell'd, from mound to mound, Subsiding danger, sought her bidden bound! Hail the white cliffs of Albion, held, serene, While round her, redd'ning, rolls the bloody scene. I hail it, all:—and hail th' acknowledg'd cause, Hail the mind's reach, that gives earth's uproar laws! Safe, mid surrounding menace, guards mankind; Guides ev'ry council! busies ev'ry wind! Shakes the world's shakers! hears, for land and main, And binds fell tyrants, while they bite their chain. Ye muse-made Mentors! rais'd, on fancy's wings, To think, for heroes, and to reign, for kings; When cou'd your sons of time's feign'd births, do more? For, ne'er true story reach'd these heights, before. Fav'rites have, oft, in many a troubled state, Poiz'd the king's love, against the people's hate; Oft, the firm leader, in some patriot scheme, Has, with bold steerage, stemm'd the royal stream: And, sometimes, too—yet rare, too rare, that praise! The safe, at home, abroad, have gather'd bays. But None, 'till Cart'ret rose, e'er hop'd to see One mast'ring genius grasp th' Unwilling three! Prince half confiding—people all unjust— Abroad all discord, and, at home, distrust— Propp'd, on himself, like the world's weight, he lay, And thro' contention's impulse, shap'd his way; Heard the clash'd elements, despis'd their brawl, Roll'd on, self-centred—and inorb'd 'em all. The Lover's Complaint. If, on the tow'ring Alps' amazing height, Whose cliffy tops our climbing eyes affright, And, with chill horror, strike the startled sight, If, there, Celinda, thou had'st chanc'd to be The piny product of some teeming tree; Tasteless, of human pity, might'st thou grow, And, forc'd to bend, when ruffling tempests blow, Nod, angry, at the plains, that spread, below. Ev'n pines, and oaks, can bend to stones, and be More flexible, than thy strong hate, to me! The greedy ocean, whose insatiate waves Flow, to devour; whose smoothest smiles are graves; Of all its monstrous forms, has none so cold, Nor does one rock, in its vast bosom, hold, That, had it sense, such cruelty would show, To triumph, in the shipwreck'd sailor's woe: Nothing, in nature, does, so fix'd, remain, But love's soft fire can gradual entrance gain, And all, but thee, once lov'd, will love again. The Transport. I. Mount my freed soul! forsake thy loos'ning clay, Broadly, at once, expand thy wingy zeal, Rapture, involv'd in raptures, feel, And, thro' yon dazzling regions, cut thy way! See! see! as 'twixt the op'ning worlds, I soar, Millions of beck'ning joys, at once, in view, Draw me, still, onward, thro' th' unfathom'd sky! Ravish'd! o'erwhelm'd! amaz'd! I fly, 'Midst pleasures, which, before, My boldest flights of fancy never knew! Oh! thou dim speck! thou dusky earth! farewel, From height, like this, I see thee, plainly, now! Thou art, at best, a kind of hope-cool'd hell! I see, and I detest thy painted pride! What sun-guilt bubbles all thy grandeurs are! What gugaws all thy tinsel'd ware! Oh! who that saw thee, hence, could swell, with pride! II. Hark! how the starry vaults of heav'n resound! With shouts, that shake the rolling orbs around! Kindly, with earth-assisting care, Descending angels aid th' o'erloaded air! And my too weighty burthen, upward, bear! High-flooding tides of rapture sense confound! Where am I, now? oh, fiercely glorious view! The liquid pavement, sparkling, shines, With star-mix'd adamant, and flaming gold! Now exstacies, past exstacies, pursue! Glory, refulgent, aking sight confines! My mem'ry lost, my trembling tongue controul'd! O! who, with mortal eyes, can heav'n's bright king behold! The Statesman. See'st thou yon mountain, so immensely high, Around whose sky-crown'd head raw tempests fly! How, low'ring darkly, o'er the shadow'd plain, It hangs, the genuine seat of horror's reign! Its craggy sides hold, thin, a sterile soil, Which, promising no harvest, tempts no toil! No grazing cattle crop subsistence, there, Nor flow'r-fed breezes feast the hungry air! No soft meand'ring current glides along, To court the meadows, with its murm'ring song, No lofty spires a wand'ring glance invite, Nor wind-shook woods arrest the ravish'd sight! All rough, and wild, it rears its rocky head, Severely aweful, and un-lovely spread: From its cold top, soil-sweeping torrents flow, Form'd, by unfruitful floods of native snow! Sorrow sits, brooding, on its furrow'd face, And desolation covers all the place. See'st thou all this, fond youth! so charm'd, with state? Such is the envy'd bliss, that gilds the great! Such are the barren honours they enjoy! For such distinction, they their cares employ! They move our pity, while they tempt our fight; High above all, indeed, but fruitless, in their height. SOLITUDE. [I.] Welcome, cool breeze, to fan my glowing mind, Cinder'd, with fev'rish cares, and constant woe! Welcome, soft bliss, by gracious heav'n, design'd, The out-worn paths of antient peace to show, The road, which wisdom loves to go, And teach aspiring man true happiness to know. In thy sweet shades, uninterrupted, reigns, Free from care-toil'd nature's strains, The downy god of ease! In thee, the innocent, and life-bless'd swains, Unsway'd, by low desire of worldly gains, Their uncorrupted senses, justly, please; Nor know the penetrating curse of pains, But travel, smoothly, up to death, by mild, and slow degrees. II. On thy calm coasts, no whirlwind doubts we find, No terrifying blasts to break soft sleep: No self-rais'd tempests shake man's hurry'd mind, For question'd riches, which the wild winds sweep, Along the furrow'd bosom of the deep; And which, ev'n e'er we gain, we fear to lose. No watchful guards, in thee, we need to keep, But rest, in peaceful slumbers, duely find, Nor feel the killing cares, which great men, madly, chuse. III Smoothly, revolving years, Unloaded, with a needless weight of fears, Slide, unperceiv'd, and steadily, away: Safe, in the humble shelter of content, Our apprehension, easy, and unbent, Sometimes, but seldom, looks abroad, to know, How things, about us, go. Sometimes, we, upward, deign to cast our eye, And view, with curious scorn, the gath'ring clouds, Which warring princes, plac'd, for mischief, high, Supinely, sit, and bid, against each other, fly: From coverts, where our choice our fortune shrouds. We see all this, and hear the noise it makes; As one, well-hous'd, sees the blue light'ning fly, And hears the rolling thunder shake the sky; While he, regardless, where the tempest breaks, Without the danger, the delight partakes: Thus, while, on earth, our bodies, happy, stay, While, here, our joy-finn'd moments swim away; Our elevated minds, above the spheres, Forget their weak-built tenement of clay; And by the trying fire of reason, grow So pure, so free, from thought-disord'ring sin, That when, from life, on their last call they go, In large expanse of soul, they, upwards, flow, And rather mix with heav'n, than dwell therein. On Mr. Cowley's introducing Pindaric Verse. I. Sacred soul! harmonious swan! Whose sweetest notes, long before death, began! And the long tuneful race, unwearied, ran! Long, before death, began the song; and still the song improv'd, And still new strings, and still new pleasure mov'd! How, mighty muse! did'st thou, and thou, alone, (For the gigantic task was all thy own) Find means to draw such unexhausted store, From springs, which were so poor? From fountains, choak'd with blood, and made, by dust, impure. How, 'midst an iron age, The dreadful, and the over-acted stage, Of undistinguish'd scenes of rage, Where striving merit, struck, by mis'ry, fell; And all, that learning, then, could teach, was, how to suffer well. How, in this toilsome age, Did'st thou, immortal man! when arts were overthrown, When all the muses garden was o'ergrown, And whole Parnassus tumbled down, Stand on its ruins, and erect a new one, of thy own. II. Yet, as within the all-enlight'ning sun, Some spots our glasses find, amidst the blaze, Too small, tho' visible, to look on, long, Because encircled, with eye-dazzling rays; So thou, great king of fancy! led astray, By thy high-melted muse, uncurb'd and gay, And prancing proudly on, in wit's unmeasur'd way! Ha'st err'd, in judgment, where thou did'st design, Thy judgment, most should shine! But all that's human, in thy verse, is lost, in the divine. Immortal man! thou dost, too rashly, blame The wasteful spirit of thy gloomy times, Ev'n of that age of crimes, Which gave the fate of suff'ring Charles to fame! Short-sighted man, scarce ever aiming right, Tho' eagle-ey'd, in mortal sight, Oft, thus mistakes, for chance, heav'n's well-resolv'd decree, And does, against it, fight! That, which lights, to shadows, are, Or peace, to war; Such was that age, to thee! Such contraries almighty wisdom finds, And stamps on human minds; That virtue's visage made, thereby, more bright, May, when set opposite to sin's black night, To strike all eyes, that shall her lustre see, Shine out, with double force, and doubly charming be. III. So fell the royal martyr, to convince The wond'ring ages since, How blest their fathers were, in such a prince! Oh! wond'rous! mystic! undiscover'd maze! What man can search his God's untrodden ways! Hence our slow learners, late, are taught lost worth to idolize! And, hence, our long posterity shall know, (What heav'n, thence, meant to show) How many curses three torn nations owe To zeal's hot sons, who, really, had no eyes, And pride, who saw truth, plain, and, seeing, durst despise. So, too, immortal subject of my muse! The fav'rite theme, she loves to chuse! So, too, the sable ignorance of that age, Like foils, which lustre can, to diamonds, give, Inspir'd thy sacred muse, with that just rage, Which greatly handing up to fame, Thine, and thy sov'reign's rescu'd name, Shall ev'n thy Pindar's praise, but in thy works, outlive. The Miracle at Cana. When Christ, at Cana's feast, by pow'r divine, Inspir'd cold water, with the warmth of wine, See! cry'd they, while, in red'ning tide, it gush'd, The bashful stream hath seen its god, and blush'd. On hearing a very dull Sermon. If, who would speak things well, must make them clear, And souls are touch'd, most strongly, thro' the ear, If none convince, but they, who, first, perswade, These preaching quacks, of heav'n, mistake their trade: Who cloak their brightness, with a cloud of form, And freeze the fancy, which they ought to warm. Arria and Pætus, from Martial. When, from her breast, chaste Arria dragg'd the sword, And, faintly, reach'd it her expecting lord; My wound, said she, but wastes unvalu'd breath, 'Tis thine, dear Pætus, gives the sting to death. An EPITAPH. Why in such thoughtless haste? O stay, and know, The dust, now mould'ring here, once hurried, so! If will, to serve, or art, to please mankind, If being mild, just, gen'rous, and kind; If harmless mirth, free friendship, stingless truth, Unswerving judgment, and un-erring youth; If these cou'd e're have brib'd the dart of death, This grave's gay tenant still had kept his breath: Stay, then! and lend one sigh, to mourn his fate, So may your loss be griev'd! so may your death be late. Teresa, to Du-Mont. Superscription. Go, happy letter! go, Into his hands, whom I adore, go, fly! And, if he asks for me, tell him I die! The Letter. I I took the paper, in my trembling hand, Which, having writ your name, my pen confin'd: And forc'd my hasty will, to make a stand, While love's imperious tempest shook my mind. II Cold, languid sweats, fall, gently, from my brow, And, while I strive to write, I love you, well; My conscious heart whispers—thou know'st not how! Alas! thou lov'st him more, than thou can'st tell. III What, then, remains, in this extreme, to do? Say, trembling hand! cold, icy heart, declare! You guide my fate: I'm blest, if you prove true, And nothing, sure! is false, that looks so fair. IV Some maids are ruin'd, and no pity find! But their deceivers were not made, like mine; Ah! who can see thy face, and not be kind? Or stand the charms of such a tongue, as thine! Du-Mont to Teresa. Superscription. Fly, truth's sad bearer, fly! To her fair hands, who blest my hopes, too late, And beg one tear, to mourn thy master's fate. The Answer. I I read, with pleasing pain, your letter o'er, And when, beyond my hopes, I found you kind, To think, I had sworn, I ne'er wou'd see you more, At once, ten thousand passions tore my mind. II The anchor-heaving ship prepares to sail; The winds, malicious, sing, at my distress; The op'ning canvas hugs th'officious gale, Did ever love chuse such a time, to bless? III Ill-judging sex! high-skill'd, in cruel arts, To hide the joy, you give, in mingled pain! Sportful, you toy, and fret your slave's fond hearts, 'Till oaths, or reason, break the galling chain. IV Then, when but one sad choice remains to take, To quit our honour, or wish'd love refuse; Too late, you sigh, for your lost servant's sake, And proffer treasures, which he dares not use. To Celinda, desiring him to describe her. Alas you know not what you bid me do! He, who loves well, can ne'er distinguish, too. To paint you, justly, asks cool reason—I Thro' passion's faithless glass, should look too high. If, when I trace you, absent, killing fair! I catch the aguish influence of despair; To search you, near, my soul cou'd ne'er endure, Without dissolving quite, in love's hot calenture. On the Death of Prince George, of Denmark. Since she, by whom her people all live blest, To sorrow's reign, has giv'n her ruling breast, Grief should be loudly heard, as well as seen, To noise his death, and mourn our widow'd queen. The friends of Anna must not, silent, weep; Of streams, 'tis said, the gentlest are most deep! But grief is passion, and, where passion reigns, Nature scorns decency, and breaks her chains: Like some fierce wind-driv'n show'r, true grief appears; 'Tis but a breeze, that is allay'd, by tears. She does, indeed, with sighs, and tears, complain, Like spring-born zephirs, mix'd, with sprinkling rain! But we, the cloud, with thunder charg'd, should spread, And gen'ral woe speak big, to suit the virtue dead. Great, as his mercy, should our pity be, Ah! who, unmov'd, can yon fair sorrow see? The royal Dane that treasure long possest, Dear, to her soul, and faithful, to her breast! Free from ambition, innocently great, 'Twixt faction's shoals, he piloted the state! And temp'ring pow'r, tho' lord of sov'reign sway, Shone bright, yet scorch'd not, like the sun, in May. PROLOGUE, Spoke by Mr. Keen. Gravely, inspir'd, we find ourselves, to-day, As much inclin'd to preach, almost, as play. What moral subject can we, then, advance, More edifying, than the turns of chance! All earthly bliss rolls, unperceiv'd, away; All mortal pow'r but prospers, to decay! Time was, when Rome's wide zeal took in such scope, That kings, and emperors stood below the Pope; But holiness, soon growing out of fashion, Dominion thought it time to change her station, And snor'd an age out, with the Spanish nation. That past, t'wards France, she wing'd her dreadful way, And flatter'd Monsieur, with all Europe's sway. Now, we, bold Britons, claim her, as our right; And, next, she talks of turning Muscovite! Thus, favour'd, by the taste of a late age, The tyrant, tragedy, engross'd the stage: Then, did the sighs of dying heroes move, And, then, you smil'd on honour, and on love: But love, and honour, bear too strict a sway, And our free Britons could not long obey! So tragedy expir'd, with many a groan; And tragi-comedy usurp'd the throne: This princess was, it seems, of mungrel nature, Fair cause for England's unmix'd race to hate her! She reign'd, but little time, and, when she fell, Brisk comedy rose, rul'd, and govern'd well: Yet, cou'd not independent pow'r maintain, So, call'd in farce, co-partner of her reign: The syren op'ra, next, uprear'd her head, And, uncontroul'd, her wide dominion spread: 'Till whim, great whim, hurl'd pow'r, at one huge throw, From opera—good Lord! to puppet-show! But 'tis mere folly, to recount past ills! 'Tis ours, to please your tastes, not check your wills! Do but, to-night, forgive our comic crime, We'll get the dev'l, and Punch, to please, in time! Cou'd you but one of our fam'd wits engage, To write some opera, fit for Punch's stage; The wire-mov'd heroes, here, should pipe their flames, And stride, in jerks, to woo their wooden dames; So, might our ruin'd stage look big, again, And break our rivals, in St. Martin's Lane. PROLOGUE, for a Friend. Prologues were look'd upon, in former days, But as the porches, not the props, of plays! At first, confin'd, in humble tone, to pray, They beg'd their hearers smile, upon the play: Favour'd, in that, they climb'd, still higher, and higher, As rising fortune much inflames desire: 'Till now, our poets teach their judges sense, And damn the audience, in the play's defence. Our author, less presumptuous, bids me say, He courts your favour, in a gentler way: The untam'd genius of the British nation, Disdains constraint, but smiles on resignation: And when, in love, or wit, we take the field, The surest way to conquer, is to yield. Not but, our brainless, has good int'rest, too, And might, perhaps, claim kin, with some of you, But he believes, he says, that, when we've shown him, The nearest to his blood, will, first, disown him. The EPILOGUE. I have been thinking, what this house must do, To share your envy'd favours, with the new: But find, we strive, in vain, their match to grow, While 'tis not they deserve, but you bestow! And no endeavours will advantage give; Our foes, who, cuckow-like, can sleep, and live! You'll not be angry, gentle-hearted beaux! 'Tis natural, you know, to hate our foes! The he controulers of our changeful state, With patient silence, bear their falling fate: But women, wives or virgins, young, or old, All claim one grand prerogative—to scold. Long have we been neglected, why, heav'n knows, For tumblers—eunuchs—fugh—and puppet-shows! Ye gods! that all new things shou'd charm the mind! New hopes, new cloaths, new faces, gull mankind. Nay, could but women change as fast as you, Your very wives, in time, might please you, too: Yet, there's one thing, that all the rest surpasses, That a new house should please, ev'n with old faces. Well, Sirs, these slights no female pride can bear, That I, this house's championess, declare; We do not only claim kind smiles, from you, But must be own'd most worthy of them, too. This, he, who dares deny, provokes my rage, And I defy him, by this knightly gage: [throws down a glove] At twelve, to-night, I'll come, alone, to meet him, And ne'er trust woman, if I don't defeat him. On the broad-brim'd Hats, which were brought over, by the French, about the Time of the Treaty at Utrecht How comes it, Messieurs! that we see you wear Hats, that so much out-swell your usual air? Had fam'd Gertruydenburg beheld this size, Th' enormous brims had spoke the wearers wise, While, there, proud conq'rors heard your monarch pray, And, roughly, clipp'd the pinions of his sway; Then, lost to fortune, and disrob'd of fame, They'd pass'd for modest cov'rings of your shame. But, now, you land, triumphant, on our shore. And Anna's thunder has forgot to roar: While, here, you, smartly, give your master law, And, from lost battles, vict'ry's triumphs draw: An English cock, methinks, with better air, Wou'd grace the transport your glad eyes declare: Change, change, your hideous brims, and timely chuse, To strike a bargain, without fear to loose: There are, at court, they say, who needs must know, Their heads will soon require a broad chappeau. The Sun-flower. I A week's long absence had Liberia kept, From those blest floors, which us'd her feet to kiss: Returning, she, to view the garden, stept, The garden, which was half Liberia's bliss. II There, while descending, 'twixt the terras walls, She saw a sun-flow'r hang its wither'd head; To Philip, loud, the wond'ring charmer calls, Tell me, ah, me! how came this sun-flow'r dead? III I know not, Madam, the prompt servant cry'd; But, for this fortnight past, it strangely pin'd! I've water'd it, in vain, and all arts try'd; 'Twas, surely, blasted, by some hurtful wind! IV Alas poor faded sun-flow'r! answer'd she, And her fair fingers to the stalk directs; Strait, from behind the leaves, out flies a bee, And, humming round her, buzz'd its due respects. V Bright maid! it said, disdain not, tho' I'm small, To be instructed, in your doubts, by me: That old wasp, whom the god of love you call, Is wing'd, and sting'd, and little, like a bee. VI Your pity seeks the mournful cause to know, Why this departed flow'r, thus, hangs its head; Since Philip can't, Oh! give me leave, to show, The unguess'd accident, by which its dead. VII Some ten days since, when bolting from your door, On this ill-fated spot you fix'd your foot; This ugly flow'r you cry'd, I can't endure; And, strait cold grief shot, tingling, to its root. VIII Since, then, each hapless hour, in swift decay, Has, more and more consum'd the with'ring stalk, And I, alas! must, now, be driv'n away, To seek chance honey, in some less-lov'd walk. IX But, let me, fair destroyer! e'er I go, One gentle caution, to your beauty, give, Since what you disapprove, must perish so, Ah! watch your words! and let the captain live. The Discovery. I. This comes to let Liberia know, That beauty is so much heav'n's care, That all, fine women say, or do, Is mark'd, and treasur'd, in the air. II. Hence, I, a stranger to your sight, Whose hand, perhaps, you do not know, Learn, all you do, by day, or night, As by these presents, I shall show. III. Your memory cannot but retain Some hint of little Pope's bold muse, Who, made, by lady's secrets, vain, Did, once, a tell-tale subject chuse. IV. Have you not read him, where he prates, Of Arabella's ravish'd hair; And stories, of those silphs, relates, Whose sweet task is, to guard the fair. V. I am that happy silph, assign'd, To screen Liberia's breast, from harms; To flutter round her, in the wind, And feast my fancy, with her charms. VI. I have you, always, in my view; And, t'other day, employ'd my wit, With nameless lines, to puzzle you, On the grief-wither'd sun-flow'r, writ. VII. I, at that time, in ambush, plac'd, Snug, under Mopsy's left ear, lay, And laugh'd, to hear, how wrong you guess'd, Who thought they came another way. VIII. 'Twas I, your faithful silph, 'twas I, That, ever studious of your ease, My skill, in verse, resolv'd to try, In verse, which, most, the fair can please. IX. Perhaps, 'twill startle you, to hear, How I, your actions, hourly, watch: That, though you see me not, I'm near; And fly, each straggling sigh to catch! X. Sometimes, in this shape, sometimes that, My various duties I perform; Sometimes, astride your rambling cat, I hide, in fur, and shade my form. XI. But, when your stroking hand I feel, From the soft back, I leap, with joy; My fairy fabrick, still, conceal, But Puss's active paws employ, And, sportful, with your milky fingers, toy. XII. Oft, as you sit, to sip your tea, In a fly's shape, your charms to search, Seeking some place, where, best, to see, I, on the lumps of sugar, perch. XIII. There, while, one day, divinely pleas'd, I gaz'd, in raptures, on your face, Your sugar-tongs the Captain seiz'd, And me, between two lumps, he squeez'd, Half dead, upon the place. XIV. But I was even with him, soon, For, catching him, all gay, At the Park door, one afternoon, With hands, too full of play: I took the figure of a gnat, And, midst his am'rous strains, Whisk'd, from your bosom, where I sat, And stung his fingers, for his pains, XV. But, oh! I tremble, to relate, How, by your smile-blest looks, bewitch'd, I, lately, 'scap'd a far worse fate; While you, with red, and yellow, mix'd, At work, on yonder threshold, fix'd, Your silky mazes stitch'd. XVI. There, I, again, a luckless fly, Not dreaming any danger near, Lay, basking in your sunny eye, My little aking heart to chear. XVII. When, on a sudden, through and through, Your piercing needle, careless, pass'd, And the drag'd silk, swift-following, too, Bound down my tiny body fast. XVIII. There, had I stay'd, transfix'd, 'till now, Nor miss'd, nor mourn'd, perhaps, by you! But, that the stitch, the lord knows how, You lik'd not, and, thank heav'n, withdrew. XIX. When, once, with you, your sister Celia stood, Celia! that sweet, and lovely maid! Two thoughtless bold park-wand'ring fops were rude, And you two charmers, both afraid, Rush'd in, and fled, dismay'd, XX. I, then, fair charge! unknown to you, By love, and vow'd revenge, inspir'd, Did, like a wasp, the fools pursue, And, slily, down their throats, retir'd. XXI. Then, to their tongue's presumptuous root, I flee, And both, with tingling venom, fir'd; Now learn, said I, when, next, you see Yon tempting pair adorn their gate, How sacred modest loveliness should be, And what the insolent prophaner's fate! XXII. Thus, all day long, is Seraphil, Liberia's wakeful silph employ'd; So rich a charge claims ten-fold skill, And care, so charm'd, can ne'er be cloy'd. XXIII. But, when, at night, the happy bed Receives her snowy limbs, to rest, I sleep's soft mist, about her spread; Then, stretch me, blissful, on her breast. XXIV. There, 'till the full grown morning smiles, In downy heavings, lost, I lie, Or, wander o'er those charms, 'twixt whiles, For which a thousand lovers die. XXV. At last, unwillingly, I rise, And seizing fast her rubied lip, In a sharp-biting flea's disguise, I, from her breath, the nectar sip. XXVI. And, then, Liberia, starting, cries, Duce take this ugly sharp-mouth'd flea! But, now I'm wak'd, I think, I'll rise: So dresses—and ne'er dreams of me! XXVII. Thus, have I honestly, at last, confess'd, What sort of little scribbling thing I be; Lest, growing curious, you might wrong have guess'd, And thought some other sent, what came from me. To Liberia, with a Squirrel. These, my last lines, I write with bleeding heart, For, oh! Liberia, and her silph, must part! I must no more engross that envy'd care, Which angels, now, in crowds, have beg'd to share. Now, I no more must flutter, in your sight, And, from your eye-beams, gild my wings, with light: No more, in fields of air, when silphs rejoice, Dance to the soft-tun'd musick of your voice! Listen no more, while, in the Mall, you walk, What the admiring crowds, that meet you, talk. On your right shoulder's tip, no more, shall blaze, Bright, with the flash of eyes, which, passing, gaze! And, when, sometimes, you're sad, no more shall I See myself weep, by peeping in your eye! These comforts past, and mention'd, now, in vain, Serve but to make remembrance ake, with pain! Little, alas! I thought, when last I writ, That I, so soon, my boasted charge must quit! But our great king, whom all we silphs obey, Wretch, that I am! commanded me away: Far off, to eastern shores, I was to go; Where the proud turk keeps love, and woman, low: Where full twelve hundred rival beauties strive, To keep one lover's lazy flame alive: Where female charms are taught the humble skill, To court the fancy, and not bow the will: To this new post preferred, I was to fly; And pass before the haughty sultan's eye; There, in his glitt'ring palace, gay with state, On his new fav'rite sultaness to wait: But, ah, Liberia! by thy sweetness won, Thy doating silph was doom'd to be undone; These proffer'd honours had no charm for me; I cou'd not taste a joy, remote from thee! Thou art my pride, and, where thou art not seen, Sorrow would catch me, tho' I serv'd a queen! This, when I told our prince, he never weigh'd My grief's just cause, but thought I disobey'd. Swift, he o'ertook me, with an angry vow, And chang'd me to the shape I come in, now. Scarce had I time, to write my wretched fate, And beg'd a friend to bring me to your gate; Helpless, and dum, ah! whither should I go, But to her breast, whose pitying soul I know? She, who, to Puss and Mopsy, kind can be, Will, sure! thought I, have some concern for me. Weak, though I am, some gratitude is due: I claim your care, for my past care of you. Elsewhere, I will not my new wants supply, And when you starve me, 'twill be time to die. I may, hereafter, some small service do, For yet my body's weak, and form but new. If you shall please to help me, thro' my youth, And, with milk-soften'd bisket, save my tooth; Grateful, when I grow up, I'll keep yours strong, And crack nuts, for you, all the glad day long; If, kindly, you shall bless me, with your care, And shield me, from the pinching wint'ry air; Close, round your neck, like some warm tippet, roll'd, In frosty nights, I'll guard you from the cold; And while, in your soft hand, you let me play, I'll growl the Captain's rivals all away. Refuse not, then, tho' chang'd, to keep me, still, And, oh! remember, Pug was Seraphil. The Motto on Pug's Collar. I am no common earth-born Pug; My name is Seraphil: Once, I was fair Liberia's silph, And am her servant, still. To my dear, and ever honoured Mother; in Answer to some Verses, which she sent me, about Spirits, from Malmesbury Abbey. Madam, your lovely muse's late employ Was read, with wonder, and a pride-mix'd joy: Fortune, in vain, her batt'ring engines bends, 'Gainst souls, which such a wit-rais'd strength defends! Secure, within, you outward storms defy, And look, serenely, on a ruffled sky: So Philomel, by night, disdaining rest, Sings, o'er the pointed thorn, which galls her breast. The busy ghosts, your fancy seems to hear, Have no design to fright your list'ning ear: Nor springs their restlessness, from Rome's old pride, Nor vain regret, that, so long since, they dy'd: A purer race these bustling spirits are, And a more noble aim inspires their care! Some beauteous band of Nuns they seem to be: Stript to the naked soul, and so set free. Thro' death's dark shade your shining form they spy, And trace your virtues, with a ravish'd eye! Hence, ev'ry night, allur'd, by fresh desire, They press to view the charms, they so admire. An Epitaph, upon a talkative Lady. How apt are men to lye! how dare they say, When life is gone, all learning fleets away? Since this glad grave holds Chloe, fair, and young, Who, where she is, first learnt to hold her tongue. A Dialogue between Damon and Philemon, concerning the Preference of a Town Life, to a Country Life. Philemon. Why does not Damon, unaspiring swain! Chuse rather not to live, than live in vain? From bright examples, thy ambition fire; Let others honours whet thy dull desire: Let rustie sports engage the lab'ring hind, And cultivated acres plow his mind! Let him, to unfrequented woods, repair, And snuff, un-envy'd, his lean mountain air; 'Till death, unsought, o'ertakes his heavy pace, And unfam'd dust consumes his mould'ring race. Do thou to warmer joys, thy wishes raise, And taste the pleasure of deserving praise! If sparkling genius does thy fancy fill, In muse-led stages, try thy journeying skill: Or, if thy soul, more roughly, is possest, And struggling valour swells thy glowing breast; To war's red toils let glory call thee hence, And draw thy untry'd sword, in Britain's just defence. Damon. And why, Philemon, to the vicious town! Not that way lies the road to just renown; No virtue prospers, in that barren soil; That nursery of unregarded toil! There, fools, and knaves, by purchas'd favour, rise, And shine, beyond the valiant, and the wise! Shall hope allure me to the wretched state, Of cringing at the levees of the great? With servile awe, to court a stately nod, And treat some glorious folly, like a god? No! sooner, I'll the clown's free labours share, And, with their brutes, a nobler burthen bear! The wars, I must allow, a gen'rous thought, A glory, by fame-thirsty spirits sought; Who, scorch'd, within, by hot ambition's flood, Quench passion's fever, in a lake of blood! 'Tis great, to see 'em march thro' cannon's roar, While sweat-wash'd wounds all-gild their faces o'er: To brave the northern blasts, and, with swoln veins, Bear scorchings, when the sultry dog star reigns. But, will your un-nerv'd youth encounter these? Ah, no! effeminate, they rust, in ease! And, should our sinewy hinds forsake the field, France will stand high, when Britain learns to yield. Philemon. Can Damon, whose bright genius strongly shines, Thro' the soft beauties of his tuneful lines; Can he defend, or muses bless the strife, Th' inglorious preference of a country life? 'Tis not, alone, for honour, or renown, The seat of wit, and pleasure, is the town: To her, ungrateful! all those darts you owe, Which, now, against her battlements you throw. For, sure! no rural dictates cou'd inspire The rapt'rous energy of Damon's fire! The cot-bred soul, with ignorance, content, Is meanly miserable, by consent: Proud, in his native sloth, he scorns to think, And has no end, in life, but meat, and drink; While the brave learn'd, whole knowledge bids him try, The mystic gulph of deep philosophy; Wades 'cross the narrow bounds, to reason, giv'n, Spurns back the measur'd earth, and fathoms heav'n! Had glory's props, in ages, long since past, In the rough mould of country life been cast; A blind stupidity the world had sway'd, And mother ignorance been, still obey'd: No deathless wit had crown'd the Grecian stage, Nor skill-mix'd courage grac'd the Julian age! No sun of thought had shin'd, with glorious beams, No, seas of knowledge spread their silver streams: Then, Damon, come, to courtly pleasures, fly, Nor, thus, th' attractive charms of wealth, and pow'r, deny. Damon. Oh! wou'd this tuneful youth, whose numbers flow, Soft, as the love-inspiring zephyrs blow: Sweet, as maids look, when, first, they own their loves, Smooth, as the down, which feathers Venus' doves. Sweet, as the dulcid streams, from Hybla run, Or, as the bloom, displaying to the sun! Oh! wou'd he to our silvan shades repair, To taste our wholesome, our inspiring air! Wou'd he but leave that sable-clouded soil, On which Aurora never seems to smile; What bright, what glorious images would rise, From all his thoughts, to emulate the skies! For, if such charms, there, in his numbers, shine, Here, they would prove extatic, and divine. But, why is Damon so ungrateful thought; As if the town his humble sallies taught! What muse cou'd e'er endure your smoke, and noise? Your night-alarms, and your tumultuous joys? No! 'tis the murm'ring brook, the shad'wy grove, And flow'r-dress'd valley, that invite their love! Then, haste, Philemon, to our blissful state, And learn to live, before it grows too late. Philemon. If truth, dear swain! with freedom, might advise, Thou may'st be happy, for I know thee wise. Quit, for a trial, once, this meagre air, And, all impartial, to thy friend repair. Then, wilt thou, ever, fix'd with me remain, And envious rustics tempt thee back, in vain. Thus, some raw youth, on a domestic shore, With terror, hears th' encircling surges roar; Trembling, he sees the threatning tempest roll, And ev'ry rising billow lifts his soul: But, when a riper age has call'd him o'er, To try the pleasures of some foreign shore, Sad, he returns, nor will, at home, remain, But pants, to taste abandon'd joys, again. Your muse, in vain, of boasted prospects sings; Your flow'ry meadows, and your murm'ring springs: Poor short-liv'd scenes of shadow-skimming joy, Whose pride a change of season can destroy! The rising floods your valleys over-flow, And winter spreads your hills, with sheets of snow: Autumnal winds strip bare your gawdy trees, And cold December nights your purling currents freeze. But we, more happy, constant blessings share, Nor hang our comforts in the changeful air: Our diff'ring seasons have their different sport, The park, the play, the tavern, and the court! Our rolling hours can sweetly wear away The utmost moments of the longest day: When, tir'd with business, we wou'd care decline, We drown the weight of thought, in gen'rous wine: By that, made sprightly, to the park repair, And, eloquently silent, court the fair: Thence, to the theatre, inspir'd, we move, And feast, at once, on mingled wit and love! These and a thousand nameless new delights, Make our days fruitful, and enrich our nights; While you, 'midst few repeated pastimes, live, Nor ever taste the joy, which changing pleasures give. Damon. 'Tis true, Philemon, our autumnal storms Disrobe our trees, and strip their quiv'ring forms: 'Tis true, our liveliest beauties are but short, Short as the joys, which recommend your court: But these new charms, in following springs, obtain, While those, once set, shall never rise again. In vain; your plays allure; all there, that's fine, Does, faintly, to our artless beauties, shine. Their scenes, as grossly, imitate our groves, As their lewd actors, our soft past'ral loves. Frequent, their comedies, to please the town, Descend to borrow, hence, some wit-grac'd clown. The park, their folly's larger stage, charms less; An ill-mix'd scene, of noise, grimace, and dress! The court, 'tis true, shines out, with tempting state; For ruin, angling, there, to catch the great, Hides the hook, wisely, with attractive bait! The joy, which wine can give, like smoaky fires, Obscures their sight, whose fancy it inspires. Thus, like old Sodom's fruit, that seat of sin, Your pleasures, fair, without, are worms, and dust, within. Philemon. Assist me, sacred sisters! aid my voice, And guide lost Damon to a nobler choice! The crowds of rustics, who, to town, repair, And quit, for vulgar hopes, their native air, Are gross-form'd vapours, heavily, exhal'd, Where profit's sunny influence has prevail'd; But those, alone, my friend! are beams, for me, Which draw such limpid innocence, as thee! What pleasures reap you, from the un-prun'd field, Which cities cannot, more compleatly, yield? If, to some peace-blest cot, we wou'd retire, An hour's short journey crowns the soft desire: There, strait, we taste the sweets, so prais'd, by you, And, then, return to those, you never knew! Ev'n heav'n approves not solitude; else, why Did his great will direct society? Why did the antients, else, to towns repair, And quit, for houses, tents, and open air? Would the great Hebrew favourite of heav'n, To whom, both pow'r and wisdom's charms were giv'n! Wou'd he, on Sion's hills, have fix'd his seat, Had rural pleasures been, in truth, most sweet? Damon. While, here, the rosy-fronted morning's light Shines o'er the hills, and charms the distant sight; While heav'n's gay choiresters, in clouds, arise, And, with harmonious warblings shake the skies: While we our mirth, with moderation, crown, And shun th' excesses of the dangerous town. Why wou'd Philemon, un-advis'd, obtrude, On us, the unfelt woes of solitude? What, tho' the Hebrew, whom you well call great, Made Sion, for her temple's sake, his seat? What knowledge did his city life impart? But, that 'twas empty all! and vanity of heart! Cowley, that shining bard, had try'd, and known, The whole heap'd pleasure of your boasted town; And, finding all its beauties false, and base, Retir'd, and, ever after, loath'd the place. Great Dioclesian, when he reach'd the height Of human glory, shook off cumb'rous state, Wak'd into man, and shun'd th' alluring bait. To rural peace, his search he, next, address'd, And, there, his crown-despising choice was blest. Philemon. Immortal Cowley's tuneful verse I own, Spoke pow'rful arguments, against the town! So Æsop's fox, in vain, exerts his pow'r, And, then, like Cowley, cries—the grapes are sow'r. Had court indulgence smil'd, as he desir'd, He never had, to rural shades, retir'd! Your Dioclesian, from plebeian birth, Rais'd to the rule of a dependant earth, Stagger'd, with giddy steps, beneath the weight, And, trembling at his danger, cast his state! But, if examples can thy genius fire, And move the rusty springs of dead desire; Behold great Plato, whose acknowledg'd fame Has, from his worth, immortaliz'd his name! Big, with town-hopes, to Dionysius, fly, And, to ambition, tune philosophy. Far-fam'd Charibdis threaten'd him, in vain, Nor Scylla's terrors fright him back again. Sicilian grandeur, like the Golden Fleece, Drew all the men of excellence from Greece; Pythagoras, to town, invites his friends; And Socrates our city life defends. But, lest you should the pow'r of truth deny, And, in a cause, so bad, unmov'd, reply; Know, tho' assembled nature's sweets combin'd, And art the country's honour had design'd; Their joint endeavours would allure, in vain, While heav'n-sought Anna does, with us, remain! For, as those parts, where Phœbus fullest shines, Tho' rough, and wild, are stor'd with silver mines; Whose wealth, attractive, draws, from lovelier lands, Advent'rous thousands, to those barren strands! So, though the city no delights possest, Did Anna chuse it, for a place of rest, Millions wou'd hurry thither, and be blest. Damon. Farewel! ye once-belov'd, retir'd abodes! Ye murm'ring springs! and unfrequented woods! Farewel, ye winged choirs! that warble there! And fill with melody, the fluid air! Ye soft amusements, which indulge, and please! And life's bent springs relax, with blissful ease! Farewel, ye rural sports! the eager chase, The mountain falcon, and the nimble race? Philemon calls; the charming swain invites! And wakes my drowsy soul to new delights. Impregnated, with fire, from his bright lines, My mind unfreezes, and my bosom shines: We not to all our country pleasures, owe Such soft delights, as, in thy numbers, flow: Less bright the rosy blushes of the morn, Than those ideas, which thy thoughts adorn! Not tuneful Philomel, so musical! Nor murm'ring springs, with sweeter accents, fall! The god of oracles inspires thy songs, And all is truth, which, to that god, belongs! Let others, then, th' unequal strife maintain. And, with Philemon's muse, contend, in vain: I yield; and, in his conquest, take more pride, Than if I'd conquer'd all the swains beside! Farewel, ye once-belov'd, retir'd abodes! I'll to Augusta, now, the darling of the gods. Philemon. Welcome, dear Damon! in a high degree, Welcome, sweet swain! to London, and to me! To love the late-shun'd field, I now begin, For, yielding thus, you, more than conquest, win. Such tender warmth, in thy soft soul, I see, That I could dwell, in woods, to dwell with thee! Secure of thee, I may, with ease, defy Th' attempt of any future enemy! Abandon'd nymphs will, now, forsake the plains, And dew-drench'd valleys weep departed swains: Envy shall leave the lonesome cottage free, For wit, and virtue, both, must follow thee. A Dialogue, between Damon and Philemon, concerning the Preference of Riches to Poverty. Damon. Accursed gold! 'till thou begot'st offence, All nature smil'd, with artless innocence: Men's days slid, smoothly on, in soft delights, Nor fear'd they villains, to disturb their nights: No blooming virgins, then, were basely sold, Slaves, to the sordid tyranny of gold! But swains, with honest hearts, kind truths express'd, And nymphs, un-blushing, their felt flames confess'd: Astræa, then, with un-stain'd glory, reign'd; The judge's ear, by brib'ry, yet ungain'd. No avarice, with her foul train, was known, But his was theirs, and ours was no man's own. War had not, yet, with stains of blood, and rage, Her mangled offspring brought upon the stage; But all, beneath the peaceful olive, sate, Fill'd, and delighted, with their blissful state. But, when thy birth, O Gold! disturb'd the world, Nature was into swift confusion hurld: Her charms were lost, and her all-pleasing forms, O'erwhelm'd, by tempests, or disguis'd, by storms: Noise, and destruction, with gigantic strides, And all their horrid children, at their sides, March'd round the frighted globe, in search of thee, And plow'd up murder, shame, and perjury! Philemon! then, th' inglorious chace refrain; Nor waste thy life, in search of sordid gain. Philemon. Gold! thou gay quintessence of earth refin'd! Which heav'n, to balance struggling pow'r, design'd! 'Till thy decisive weight depress'd the scale, Contenders did, alternately, prevail! Now, reign'd, as lord, some chance-ascending swain; Another conquers him, yet wins, in vain; A third dethrones 'em both, nor can his pow'r maintain. Each wou'd be chief, but all un-help'd by thee, Stick, in the mire of mean equality. Gold, first, the famish'd mouth of learning fed, And drew the curtain, which dark ignorance spread. No lab'ring industry alarm'd the day, For there was no reward, such toil to pay. None, to the search of knowledge, would aspire, Since wit's increase could raise their wealth no higher: Supine stupidity forbad all strife, And sleep refresh'd not, but imprison'd life! But, since thy worth, O Gold! was greatly known, Arts have sprung, thick, and hope is wider grown. Men, blest with thee, the murm'ring world command, And tread down discord, in each rebel land: In hopes of thee, the stupid aim, to think, And sin's broad eye, for profit, learns to wink. The sea's vast depth, for thee, we boldly sound, And sleep, un-dreading, upon hostile ground. For thee, the hind, with plenty-spreading hand, Lifts lazy nature, from his sluggish land: Thou, Gold! can'st melt the frosty-breasted fair; And dry damp sorrows, and soul-drenching care! In short, by gold alone, we happy live; O, Damon! joys are goods, which only gold can give! Damon. Thus, does the glitt'ring fiend debauch our wills, And smiles, to see us stroke his sting-hid ills: Base dirt! the fools, who are enslav'd, by thee, Slaves to a slave confess themselves to be! 'Tis true, thou art the origin and source, Whence pow'r first rose, and which maintains her course! But, what is pow'r, which wealth, not justice, gives? How ill-distinguish'd such a sov'reign lives! Could men but read the Gallic monarch's breast, And trace swift tumults thro' his broken rest, How would they curse his shadow-circled state, And laugh at envy, which maligns the great! Sometimes, O shame! the fair thy pow'r adore, And feign to love, where they disdain'd, before. But, ah! the tempters, who this charm have try'd, Gain'd not the woman, but the woman's pride! Can, then, Philemon, whose alluring strains, Lov'd by the nymphs, and envy'd, by the swains, Might reconcile antipathies, and move The cruel hearts of savages, to love! Can he esteem that baneful oar divine? Or kneel, dishonoured, at blind fortune's shrine? No—rather in her lewdest form, describe That stain-affixing foe, to virtue's snow-wash'd tribe. Philemon. Damon, I love thee! and thy welfare seek; Thence, lend my truth the liberty to speak: Just as I wish, my friendship wou'd advise, And have thee rich and mighty, as thou'rt wise: Thy keen-wrought edge of satire, cuts too deep, Not, always ills, we, from wealth's harvest, reap. Gold is the gift of heav'n; and heav'n is wise! And knows the worth of virtue's far-wish'd prize. The starts, which shake the Gallic monarch's breast, Those night-born tumults, which distract his rest, Spring not from gold, my Damon, but, from pride, Which swell'd ambition, with too high a tide. Had he been pleas'd, with glories gain'd before, Fate had not dash'd his hopes, in search of more: Tho' gold the engine of man's fortune is, The pilot wisdom must direct the bliss: Calm moderation ought to measure choice, And high-flown wishes stoop, at reason's voice. The sun, which, at such distance, paints the year, Would scorch it, Damon, if it came too near. You may, with ease, o'er shining millions reign, And never be a slave to flowing gain. But he, whose birth-directing stars decree, That he shall wear out life, in poverty; Let him be cast in nature's choicest mold, And lord of every gift of heav'n, but gold; While that, alone, he wants, to crown the rest, Not all his other charms can make him blest. Damon. PHILEMON's lines do gold so far out-shine, So far more radiant, dazzling, and divine! That ev'n the praise, he gives it, serves to show, What more, to wisdom, than to wealth, we owe! But, oh! 'tis false, that gold can give us friends, Flatt'ry and friendship, have wide-diff'ring ends: They, who crowd round us, while our hopes look gay, Will, in the dusk of fortune, shrink away. Timon, the brave! the gen'rous! and the great! Timon, the wise! but wise, alas! too late! Who dragg'd, of wealth's proud dross, a mighty load, And shed his blessings, round him, like a god! Timon, who heal'd the woes of half mankind! What curs'd returns did wretched Timon find? Content is bliss, I'll, with Philemon, hold; But that was never purchas'd, yet, by gold: Our affluence but serves to spur desire, And dang'rous flights attain'd, but tempt us higher. Philemon. Oh! let me triumph, in a golden fate! If I am rich, I can be, wisely, great. With nice-tim'd aids, can fainting worth assist, And make the wretched happy, when I list: But, if on fortune's barren strands, I lie, My fruitless pity shall, unpity'd, die! You tell me, Damon, friends are bought, and sold, And that assistance comes, and goes, with gold. If help, in life, affords the greatest bliss, Sure! that, which buys that help, the greatest comfort is. Damon. All your strong arguments no proof produce, Of gold's intrinsic value, but its use! Your generous soul, your friends would entertain, And general bliss, with wide-spread aids, maintain; Call forth dim virtue, on the world to shine! 'Tis great! 'tis wond'rous great! 'tis all divine! But still, Philemon, this sublime delight, Springs not from gold's access, but from its flight! You praise the use, yet cannot bear the sight. Shou'd villains aid me, some worse foe to kill, I'd love the act, but hate the villain, still! I'd prize a truth, sent in the Devil's name, But still abhor that Devil, from whom it came. So, gold, pernicious in its nature, may, By souls, like yours, be bent a nobler way: Thus, as the needle, by magnetic force, Once touch'd, still, to the magnet guides its course. Trembling, while wand'ring thence, and finds no rest, 'Till clasp'd, and fastened, to its darling breast. So, tho' our thoughts, on diff'rent points, design, Meeting, at last, we, in one center, join, And, in the union, lose the terms of mine and thine. Philemon. I praise, dear swain, the use of gold, 'tis true; But use includes intrinsic value, too; Whence, but from use, does estimation rise? And ev'ry thing is worth, what ev'ry thing supplies. 'Tis true, a diamond cannot keep out cold, Nor can we eat or drink our heaps of gold: Yet, bless'd with either, Damon, we can buy, What neither, in their nature, can supply. And since, for wealth, the joys of life are sold, There's an intrinsic value, sure, in gold! I hold, with Damon, gold should be a slave; I treat, as such, the moderate sums I have. And, as kind fortune shall encrease my store, I'll make a slave of that, and ten times more. Yet, gold possesses every healing pow'r; Not love, alone, falls in a golden show'r. Gold makes men wise, as well as gives 'em rule; For who e'er knew a wealthy man a fool? Ev'n in the shades below, the rich were blest, And borne, by Charon, to the fields of rest. While the poor beggar, shiv'ring, on the shore, Wanting his penny, found no passage o'er. So, poverty, with shame, to death, was hurl'd, And drew down scandal to the other world! But, since my Damon, whom the muses bless, Affects not gold, and bids me love it less, I'll listen to his sweet bewitching voice, And guide my soul, to meet him, in his choice. Since, then, nor you, nor I, can happy be, You, with much gold, nor I, with poverty, Let's bend our search, to find some freer fate, And crown our wishes, in the middle state. To a Lady, desiring to know, what Love was like. Love is a treacherous heat, a smothering spark, Blown up, by children's breath, who shun the dark: At first, the fire is innocently bright, Glows gently gay, and scatters warm delight: But left, neglected, and unquench'd, too long, The nourish'd flame grows terrible and strong; 'Till, blazing fierce, it spreads on every side, And burns its kindler, with ungrateful pride. Plain Truth. Chloe, you talk, with joy, of Celia's face, Admire her wit, and ape her fancy'd grace; The praise, you give is, sure! sincere respect, Your practice proves, what airs your thoughts affect. But, since you know, that friendship should be free, Give her this hint, and say—it came from me. A face, like hers, if manag'd well, might please, But no charm strikes, that is not arm'd with ease, Striving too eagerly, she strives, in vain: These studied airs put beauty to the strain: Wou'd she wound sure, and conquer, with a grace, Tell her, the careless runner wins the race. Celinda, in the Snow. I Celinda, riding, in a snowy day, The wind-driv'n flakes, about her, hov'ring, flew, Some to her tempting bosom, made their way, And, melting, chill'd her beauties through and through. II Some, aiming with less art, her cloaths beset, And froze to little buttons, as they fell; Others, which could not such fair quarters get, Flew by, unblest, and miss'd the shiv'ring belle. III Quite tir'd, at last, and, freezing, as she rode, Her ivory teeth all chattering, in her head; Was ever such a day, she cry'd? good God! If it much longer snows, I shall be dead. IV Madam, said I, 'tis true; your lovely breast Is far more us'd to give, than suffer pain; Yet, of this accident, to make the best, 'Tis better I should preach, than you complain V All nature's works, in some degree, alike, Confess the wisdom of their maker's will, And bear hid meanings, man's dark mind to strike, With mystic hints, that try comparing skill. VI Thus, some, with envy fill'd, envenom'd look, And gnaw themselves, when happier men they see! Some can success, in others, gladly brook, Tho' they, perhaps, steep'd o'er, in misery, be. Others, again, by outward winds, unshook, All chances, but their own, indifferent, see. VII So, my Celinda, 'tis, with this sharp snow, Those feath'ry flakes have, each, a sev'ral aim; The envy-acted see your bosom glow, And rush, malicious, to assault the flame. VIII But, shock'd, to find themselves, when nested there, So far exceeded, in their boasted white; With melting grief, their humbled pride they bear, And weep themselves to death, to shun the sight. IX Others, of this white tribe, that see, and know, With rev'rence, shun that bliss-warm'd breast of thine, But strive t' adorn thy dress, with some new show, And, froze to glitt'ring gems, about thee shine. X A third sort, unattracted ev'n by thee; And cold, indeed, such snow we ought to call; With dull indiff'rence, all thy charms can see, And, disregardful, round thee, scatt'ring, fall. XI Celinda, list'ning, answer'd, with a smile, You Poets keep your fancies always warm; Could but this inward heat the frost beguile, We need not stop, at yonder smoaky farm. The Windfall. I A Preaching brother of that clan, Whose holiness is form, Had gravely cloak'd his outward man, His inward fear'd no storm. II With sanctify'd, and measur'd tread, And conscience-strutting stalk, His rev'rence brimm'd his solid head, And took a lonely walk. III As thro' a wood, he bent his way, A sister of his flock, Accosted him, and beg'd his stay, Her bosom to unlock. IV Sure, Sir, said she, from heav'n, you came, To this convenient place, Where I, in private, with less shame, May open you my case. V Oft have you, from the pulpit, told, That it should be our care, To keep our flesh from growing bold, By fasting, and by pray'r. VI Good god, he knows, what pains I take, To mortify, in vain; Fasting, sometimes, makes sin's heart ake, But eating sets all wrong again. VII Alas! reply'd the holy man, And turn'd up both his eyes! We are to do, but what we can, The rest heav'n's grace supplies! VIII So frail, dear lamb, our natures are, That, in things, most forbid, We're apt to fancy joys most rare, Most worth our taste, are hid! IX Thou, pretty worldling! I dare say, Art, yet, an untouch'd maid? O dear, said she, I hope so, pray; You think not, I'm afraid? X Why dost thou wrong me, answer'd he, And slyly look'd about; To judge if any eye might see, Ere, thus, he solv'd her doubt. XI Pure innocence! thy pray'rs are heard, The spirit swells within; Means offer, how thou may'st be clear'd, From this desire to sin. XII Inspir'd with sudden pow'r and will, In this alluring place; I'll give thy erring wish its fill, To prove 'tis frail and base. XIII When thou shalt taste this fancy'd joy, Which, now, thou dream'st so great; Thou'lt find it but a transient toy, And grace gain future weight. XIV Come closer, child! but hold, 'tis fit, That what's intended well, Should have some form, to differ it, From wishes, where sins dwell. XV I will not, therefore, throw thee down, Nor shalt thou, willing, fall: Let's see—ay, thus, I'll blow thee down, And, then, thou hast a call. XVI So done, so said, the brother blew, And down the sister fell: Such bliss, unhop'd, and lawful, too! She thought, 'twas mighty well! XVII But mark the chance—a wood-man, nigh, Had heard, and ponder'd all: He saw the damsel, passive, lie, And bless'd the well-tim'd fall. XVIII Old Reverence, not too well prepar'd, Stoop'd low, to seize his prey; When out the wood-man jump'd, and star'd, And push'd him, bluff, away, XIX Begone, said he, thou form-drest thief! All Wind-falls, here, are mine: So, on he fell, and, to be brief, Made good the holy man's design. To Celinda, in Excuse for looking on her at Church. If, fix'd on yours, my eyes, in pray'r, you see, You must not call my zeal idolatry! For, since our maker's throne is plac'd so high, That only, in his works, the god we spy: And what's most bright, most gives him to our view; I look most near him, when I look on you. Chloris to Aminta. I. Come, Chloris, to Aminta's breast retire; Let thy soft sorrow's sympathetic dew, Shed its damp influence on love's smoaky fire, In both our bosoms, the same end pursue, And both, at once, with purer flames inspire. Let it, miraculously strong, this double wonder do! At once, quench love, and light up friendship, too. Since tender passions prove too weak, To lift thy sinking hope; And ev'n thy downy nature cannot break That stubborn flint, which binds, with narrow scope, Philander's rocky heart. Bid thy ill-entertain'd, unwelcom'd guest, depart, And do not own the wound, at least, tho' still thou feel'st the smart. Beauty must blush with burning shame, To see the frozen salamander lie, Insensible of heat, amidst such flame, And all love's penetrating fires defy: See, with disdain, how cool he sits, and slights thy proffer'd charms, Nor offers, once, to stretch his icy arms. II. Come to my softer grasp, thou lovely maid! Too innocent, to hope for fortune's aid! And too, too sweet, to be betray'd! Come, Chloris! to Aminta's close embrace, Her breast will take thee in, and give thee space! There thou, and only thou, can'st claim a place, I'll clasp thee fast, and, if I cannot please, Thy every wish, to give thee perfect ease, I'll labour, slow, by safe degrees, To crown as many, as I can: For I am not that able ill, that undertaker, man! Yet, if I fail, like man, throughout to please, This, Chloris, let me urge, in recompence; Ruin might flow, from man, in vows, like these, Mine carry innocence. III. Fly, careless, kind, unwary wantons, fly! When man, the smiling mischief, man! comes nigh, He, the envenom'd viper, bites our poison-trifling sex; While they, with fancy's tickling twigs, seek all the time to vex, And think, vain fools! they him perplex! How do the skill'd deceivers put on pain! How feelingly they feign! How do they tempt, swear, promise, plead, and pray? How do they melt, in soft-dissembled grief? 'Till air-built vows our yielding hearts betray, And pity gives us up to vain relief: Then, smiles the wretch, at what his arts have done, Proud of the conquest, though so basely won. IV. Despise we, then, all hopes, so false, as these, Fruitful prospects most should please: High-flooding joys, which come, without degrees, Like summer torrents, rise o'er hills and trees; But, swiftly sweeping back again, bear, with 'em, all our ease. Give me the cooler wint'ry flood, Which, not so pleasant, does more good; Rises gently, makes long stay, And when, at last, it creeps away, Enriches all the soil, it leaves, with fertilizing mud. Come, then, Chloris! fill my arms! There, taste passion, void of harms! And, oh! if female grasps insipid seem, To you, who of more solid raptures dream, Think, and thinking, you'll be wise, And back departed judgment bring: The noisy bee, that, humming, flies, And boasts what honey he supplies, Says nothing, of his sting. Good-Friday. I. Am I awake? or, is my soul misled, Thro' the bold tracks of mem'ry's mazy deep? The empty realms of mimic sleep, Horrors, by wild imagination, bred, Skim shadowy, and, about me, circling, spread! Oh! who can tell the cause of these new fears? Whence these loud groans, which tortur'd fancy hears? Whence this thund'ring, in my ears? Why seems the starting sun to hold back day? Why does he leap, at once, out of his fire-pav'd way? And, half-extinguish'd, upward fly, To shroud his beams, behind a sabled sky? Why, every way, at once, are those swift lightnings hurl'd? Trembling nations to amaze, And terribly adorn, with quiv'ring blaze, The horrors of a shade-benighted world? II. Why breaks yon rising ocean o'er the lands? Disdainful of its old appointed bounds: Why does it open, far behind, its brine-delighted sands, And, leaving dry its roomy bed, Let loose, at once, high lift its frightful head, To seek forbidden grounds? And, hugely swelling, from a-far, with earth-assaulting roar, Rise o'er the swallow'd mountain tops, and sweep the kingdoms o'er: Why does this circle-spreading earthquake swell, Deep-flowing, like a subterraneous tide? Frighted fancy! can'st thou tell, Why this strong foe, asham'd, his face should hide? 'Tis not, sure! for want of pride, He shakes down cities, with his mildest shocks; Plows in the hill, he rolls beneath, and harrows up the rocks! Unseen, he, dreadful, does appear; The marble-hearted mountains quake for fear! And, as they find the danger drawing near, With huge unweildy terror, leap aside, And, shook with agues, cast their snowy pride. III. The dead, themselves, by nature's charter, blest, With promis'd beds of lasting rest, Are, from their graves, their dark long homes, thrown up, and dispossest. See the pale ghosts of our forefathers rise! Horribly serene, they glide, And snuff, with shadowy nostrils, scents of day, Which fled so lately, all at once, away! See! how to earth, they bend their beamless eyes, And seem to wander, guideless, every way, Unwilling, thro' our hated world, to stray! In search of the forgotten graves, where, once, their bodies lay! Too conscious soul! I feel it now! Well may the stubborn pride of nature bow! Well may trembling nations moan, And mem'ry, sick with consternation, groan! God, who to man his ev'ry blessing gives; From whom, ungrateful, he receiv'd his breath: That God, by whom, alone, man lives, That very God, this day, by man, met death To a Reverend Friend, on his first Promotion in the Church. While easy, now, you, to cool shades, retire, Soft, as the innocence of your desire; Refin'd, as your well-govern'd passions are, And, sharply gentle, like your worldly care: I, toil'd with life's fatigues, stick fast, in town, And waste slow hours, in search of vain renown. Snatch at coy fortune, still, as she appears, And wear out chequer'd time, in hopes, and fears. But tir'd, at last, with the bespotted scene, More pleas'd, I, toward your brighter prospect, lean, And, while your glitt'ring stars shine out so clear, I half forget the pains, which gall me, here. Methinks, I see you far-advancing, still, I see you, on religion's mightiest hill! Your sleeves of lawn I see! and mitred head! And crowds, that kneel before your reverend tread! Then, aw'd with pious love, my ravish'd eye Akes, for your blessing, as you pass me by. 'Twill be! the watchful saviour wakes above, Still views his church, with a paternal love! He weighs the zeal, which his lov'd laws inspire, And having mark'd you, of his holy choir, Will lift you to behold your virtues nigher. Oh, happy she! who, blest, for both your sakes, In your pure breast, her earthly heav'n partakes! And when, at last—long may it be! she dies, May plead your passport, as she upward flies! The Disparity. From a Hint of Sir Henry Wotton. I. Ye starry sparks, on which, by night, we gaze, That meanly satisfy our distant eyes, More, by your number, than your blaze, Ye common people of the skies! What are ye, when the sun shall rise? II. Ye warbling rangers of the groves! That sweetly strain your little throats: And, perch'd on boughs, to sing your loves, Charm the still forest, with your notes; Who will admire your tuneful lays, When Philomel her voice shall raise? III. Ye violets, that, in early spring, appear, And, cloath'd in purple, wait upon the sun; Adorning earth's damp face, with blooming chear, And making ev'ry verdant bank your own, What are ye, when the rose is blown? IV. So, when my charmer shall be seen, Gaz'd on, and wonder'd at, by all! Beauty must own her rightful queen, And ev'ry fair usurpress fall: For she was, sure! by heav'n, design'd, Th' eclipse, and glory, of her kind. Martial Epig. 59, Lib. 7. Ad Jovem Capitolinum. Great Capitolian Jove! thou God, to whom, Our Cæsar owes that bliss, he sheds on Rome! While prostrate crowds thy daily bounty tire, And all thy blessings, for themselves, desire: Accuse me not of pride, that I, alone, Put up no pray'r, that may be call'd my own: For Cæsar's wants, O Jove! I sue to thee, Cæsar himself can grant what's fit for me. In Pompeios. Great Pompey's ashes, in vile Egypt, lie; His sons, in Europe, and in Asia, die: What wonder, that these three, so distant, dy'd, So vast a ruin could not spread less wide! Belinda's Grave. Here, woe-mark'd spot! once, dear Belinda lay; Here, her cold bosom mix'd with colder clay: And, here, despairing, and afflicted, I Planted this tree, which now makes haste to die. While this lov'd cypress a sad shelter made, Oft wou'd I lose myself, beneath its shade: Guide, with a painful pleasure, each dear shoot, And water, with my tears, the rich-fed root. Sigh, through the boughs, like some moist April breeze, And the grasp'd trunk, in am'rous rapture, squeeze. And when some warbling songster, nested there, Belinda's voice, methought, shook soft the air! The murm'ring branches, bending, from the wind, Breath'd a cool comfort o'er my love-shook mind. Thus, sev'n long years, I learnt to hear, and see, My lost Belinda, in her funeral tree! But mad, at last, and all impatient grown, To make my fruitless passion still more known: Fatally fond, I cut a cruel mark, And carv'd my name, upon the shrinking bark. Wretch that I was! the tree, from that curs'd day, In sad resentment, pin'd itself away! And that new life, which dead Belinda gave, Wither'd, with pain, crept, downward, to her grave. The Royal Sepulchre. Is this the boastful pride of mortal state? Is it for this we covet to be great? What short-liv'd bliss, from envy'd grandeur springs, When these poor reliques, once, were mighty kings! O frail uncertainty of earthly pow'r! Where graves can majesty itself devour! How naked, now, does royalty appear! Alas! how vast, how sad a change is here! Tell me, dumb dust? how wide was thy command? Where's, now, the sceptre, that once fill'd this hand? Where are those brawny guards, which aw'd thy state? Where the gay crowds, which, once, were proud to wait? Can narrow limits, dark, like these, contain The chang'd extent of thy contracted reign? Canst thou, at whose least frown, a nation shook, And, trembling, watch'd the light'nings of thy look: Canst thou, at last, grown humble, be content, To let bold search prophane thy monument? And common men, grown rude, and wanton, too, Thus poize your dusty bones, and wonder at the view. May-Day. Welcome, dear dawn of summer's rising sway, Fair fav'rite of the year! soul-soft'ning May! Late, I have learnt, by love's sweet Queen, inspir'd, Why, from my youth, this day my bosom fir'd; 'Twas for her birth, that blooming nature sprung, 'Twas in her notes, the sky's soft rangers sung! The breeze blew soft, o sigh her soul's sweet frame, And the boughs bent, in homage to her name. Thick shot the meads, to paint her fruitful mind, And flow'rs, that roll'd her breath, enrich'd the wind. For her, the sun wake'd out, to bless our isle, And lighted up half heav'n, to paint her smile: Oh! we are lovers all! our Celia reigns, And the warm'd world is sick, with my sweet pains. PROLOGUE. Designed for a Tragedy, yet unpublished, called the Roman Revenge. [After a short flourish of Musick, enter Fancy, rob'd in white, her hair loose and flowing.] Fancy. Fancy, an airy form, of turn, too gay, Acts not a part, in this distressful play: Yet, to your aid she comes, in each new scheme, And, thus, invokes a pow'r, that suits the theme. Genius of Liberty! this night attend; Hear, from thy silent shades, and, rous'd, ascend. When Cæsar bleeds, 'tis thine, to fear disgrace; Or justify a death, that stains thy race: Genius of Liberty! thy fame defend: Genious of Liberty! thrice call'd, attend. [To an overture of warlike music, heard at a distance, under the stage, arises, thro' the large central opening, the Genius of Liberty, reclining on the side of a rock, as just wak'd, by the sound of the melody.] Genius of Liberty. From a long sleep of twice nine hundred years, Smiling, behold! the summon'd pow'r appears! Pleas'd, to congratulate by heav'n's command, Lengths of new greatness, for this free-born land, [Exit Fancy.] In Greece, and Rome, friends to the muse's art, The scene sustain'd my pow'r, and breath'd my heart: 'Till poorer passions, dark'ning many an age, Erring, defac'd the state, and sham'd the stage: Then spleen, and vengeance, mis-assum'd my name, And mercy fell, and malice rose to fame! All things were chang'd, religion was pretence, Law was oppression; reason, violence: Jocky'd, by sharpers, honesty distrest, Politely laugh'd at! grew the great man's jest. Valour was lost, in state-craft—solid sense, In sound;—and modesty, in impudence. Then genius sunk, and dullness ravish'd praise, And laureat brows undignify'd the bays. FOE to such tasteless times, I shun'd to rise, For Freedom cannot live, where virtue dies. Here, tempted, gladly, I obey the call, And breathe my Roman spirit o'er you, all. Henceforth, be Britain bless'd; from Licence, free, Let her deserve, and hold fast Liberty: Let her brave sons disdain their sons to sell, And taste of freedom, thirst of bribes expel; Let her, abroad, command, at home, obey; And love of glory be her statesmen's pay, Let her, no longer, languishing, and lost, Feed musick's indolence, at meaning's cost: Let manly reason, pantomime o'erturn; Let Shakespear triumph, and let opera burn. Such is the charmful change, I rise, to bring; What more remains—two of my sons shall sing. Replaces himself on the rock. Then rises (to brisk musick) the Genius of Good Sense, on one side, and the Genius of Good-nature, on the other. [N. B. These two were to be represented by the two little Hamiltons.] The following SONG, To the Tune of Jolly Watermen. Good Sense. D'ye know me! yes, Good Sense, my name; Despise me not, though small; For wou'd the pit grow kind to wit, You'd see me, soon, grow tall. Toll loll, &amp;c. Good Nature. For me, my name's Good Nature, The tinyest thing alive; But wou'd you be, from faction, free, Good Lord! how I should thrive! Toll loll, &amp;c. Good Sense. Wou'd handsome wives be rul'd by me, They should, with kindness, kill; In Joy, grow old, and never scold, And please, without Quadrille. Toll loll, &amp;c. Good Nature. Their husbands, then, should learn to love, And lead the happiest lives: Forbear to roam, and find, at home, Whate'er they want, in wives. Toll loll, &amp;c. Good Sense. The Courtier, he should learn from me, To hope no comfort, there: And he, whom fate, has made not great, Should bless his 'scape, from care. Toll loll, &amp;c. Good Nature. To painful prudes, and light coquetts, I'd give these safe alarms: That art is base, and spoils a face, While goodness, always charms. Toll loll, &amp;c. Good Sense. Poets should fall in love, with me, Good nature.With me, the dreadful pit: Good Sense.Good sense combin'd— Good Nature.Good nature join'd, Both.Then, hey boys, up goes wit. Toll loll, &amp;c. Genius of Liberty. Enough, my children; come, attend me, near; And, going, leave, behind, your influence, here. [All descend into the Places they rose from.] Moses's Song of Thanksgiving. On the Overthrow of Pharaoh, in the Red-sea, from Exodus Chap. xv. The first Part only. I. Temples, and altars, let us raise, Ours, and our father's God, provokes our praise. God is our strength, God is our theme: Where is Egypt's fall'n esteem? Pharaoh wakes, from his proud dream: Wakes, to feel a warrior's hand. Lord of a pow'r more vast, than his, that shakes his wond'ring land! Vainly, the following foes our God defy'd, Their rapid wheels, in vain, tore up the strand: In vain, they mock'd the waving wand; Not all their noise could the loud sea withstand; The wat'ry world flow'd, fearless, o'er their pride, A drowning army beat th' involving tide. On wave-wash'd chariots, half-sustain'd, the trembling captains ride. Up-lifted hoofs paw'd, loose, the liquid way; And, round 'em, black'ning thro' the foam, the floating legions lay. Down, down, th' ungrounded footsteps go; Strain'd, to feel for sands, below, Sands, where wat'ry mountains flow! Sinking, like rocks, they clog the deep, with prey, High-cov'ring, rose the briny flood, and swept their rage away. II. Saving God! thy hand was, here! Thou protecting, who can fear? Threat'ning aloud, the thund'ring legions rose, And, at thy chosen, shook th' extended spear: Behind, amaz'd, we saw th' o'ertaking foes, Hearts anticipating blows. But, while thy blast, O base despair! blew keen, Safely, from heav'n, shot down, between! Dreadful, in wrath, thy lifted arm but shone, And, all th' unnumber'd thousands melt away: O'er stubbly fields, so, wind-driv'n fire rolls on, And sweeps the blazing breadth, with crackly sway. III. Th' almighty's voice but spoke a loud command, And, strait, th' unlinking surges, backward, rise. High-climbing waves, in quiv'ring mountains, stand, And hang their billowy horrors, in the skies. In murm'ring cleft, th' obedient deep yawns wide, And shad'wy glooms loure dark, from either side! Down, thro' the horrid vale's moist concave, led, Safe, and dry, bold Israel tread; Gay, 'twixt terrors, round her, spread, Her tearful eye, now, smil'd, once more, and hail'd her guardian God. IV. Hark! aloft, the wond'ring foe! Look! they cry'd, all pointing low, Shall the cowards 'scape us, so! 'Twixt the dividing waves, they go! Their sorc'rer cleaves the sea, with magic skill: Haste, prevent, o'ertake, and kill. They hear, they march—they dare the mad command; The shouting squares invade the cover'd strand; Chariots, impell'd on fiery wheels, gore wide th' encumber'd sand. Mix'd horse, and foot, in bann'ry pomp, descend: See! from each horn, th' inclining length'ners bend, Loose, slides the weeping Oose, to shun their weight, And the deep, murm'ring, mourns th' unusual state. V. Hark! the bursting thunder speaks! Waves, your wat'ry ranks disband! Oh, behold! how vain, how weak, Strength, that dares its God withstand! Down, at once, from either hand, Hoarse-sounding hills, o'er hills let loose, devour the vanish'd sand! Helpless, engulph'd, th' immerging squadrons roll: Pharaoh, proud-sinking, drinks down brine, that chills his fiery soul. Mix'd, on th' evolving surge, a-while, they strive, Then, like sunk plumbets, to the bottom, dive. Of all the Gods, no God, like ours, is found! Join, heav'n, and earth, applause like his, let men, and angels, sound. David's Elegy, for the Death of Saul and Jonathan. (2 Kings, Chap. 1.) I. O Israel! how does all thy beauty fade! How are the mighty fall'n! the strong betray'd! Ne'er may this woe, in Gath's full streets, be told; Never let Ascalon our fate unfold. II. Mountains of Gilboa! may ye drink no dew! Let rain's mourn'd want turn red the verdant hue! Let your vines wither, and your olives die. And your parch'd fields no grainy wealth supply. For, there, abandon'd Saul, brave monarch, bled, As if no aweful oil had hemm'd his head. III. Never, in vain, drew Jonathan his bow; Never, Saul's sword fell, frustrate, on a foe: Lovely, and loving! one dear life they led, Nor parted, dying, but together, bled. Swifter, than eagles, to the fight they flew, Stronger, than lions, they could foes pursue. IV. Daughters of Israel! weep the loss of Saul: In scarlet, and in gold, he cloath'd you, all: Peaceful, beneath his warlike shade, you smil'd; And triumph'd, by their toil, whose hosts he spoil'd. V. Thee, Jonathan, my brother! thee, I mourn, With grief, still growing, must thy loss be borne: Soft, and delightful partner of my soul! Two halfs, divided, made us one dear whole. Vast was thy love, and wonderful, to me; And never woman lov'd, as I lov'd thee. To Celia. Oh! thou eclipse, and glory, of thy kind! Thou vast o'erwhelmer of the drowning mind! Bid me not write my thoughts, or speak my pain, 'Till thou hast giv'n me back my soul, again: As well might shipwreck'd slaves, who, floating, lie, Swim, through the billowy storms, which sweep the sky, As my poor sighing breast its torments show, And paint, in cool description, burning woe. Lost to sense, mem'ry, meaning—all, but thee! I drag on life's dull load, in misery. Absent, from those dear eyes' destructive shine, I pant, methinks, to tell thee, why I pine. But, when I touch my pen, my flaming heart Burns up, at once, and dazzles trembling art. Love's scatt'ring sparks, on my full bosom, fall, And, kindling wild reflection, blows up all. To a Lady, on calling me Jealous. I He, whose whole treasure one dear vessel bears, Thro' seas, on which destructive pirates swarm. Must be excus'd a thousand fears and cares, And bend his soul to ev'ry strong alarm. II Ill do they love, and feel thee, at their heart, Who seem unmov'd, while others hope thee theirs; My kindling bosom burns, with open smart, For my proud soul her unveil'd meaning wears. III Nice, as thy own, and all refin'd, as thine, My tow'ring passion climbs, with gen'rous flame; But, shrinking from neglect, in sad decline, Burns downward, and forgoes a frustrate aim. IV Tender, as infant sighs, in slumb'ring ease, My soft'ning soul admits, and owns thy sway: 'Tis my life's sweetest care, thy taste to please, And, in thy sunshine, melt my griefs away. V Woes are too weak, to wound me, thro' thy smiles, The pole's fix'd frost were warm, as heav'n, to me; I tread down malice, thro' her mazy wiles, And triumph over all things, charming thee. VI What task so dang'rous, or, what toil so vast, Would not thy love inspire me to defy! Soul'd, with immortal fire, my flame must last; And I should conquer worlds, beneath thy eye. VII Oh! that my struggling thoughts, which heave, within, Cou'd borrow but a voice, and speak my soul; Then, would this heart thy grateful passions win, 'Till—oh! vast empire! I should claim the whole. VIII Yet, as it is, indulge my trembling fear, And give thy lover's counsel leave to speak: Fools are all false, nor, long can hold thee dear, For soon they find, whate'er they know to seek. IX Boastful, ungenerous, vain, and grossly mean; On all thy charms, they only feed their sense; Thou art, by them, but as meer woman seen, Blind to thy heav'n, of inward excellence. X Sudden, the wretches' smoaky flames expire; Such earthy fuel must, of course, decay; But I, while adoration lifts desire, Light up a love, that ne'er can burn away. Alone, in an Inn, (at Southampton.) April the 25th, 1737. Twenty lost years have stoln their hours away, Since, in this inn, ev'n in this room, I lay: How chang'd! what, then, was rapture, fire, and air, Seems, now, sad silence, all, and blanc despair! Is it, that youth paints every view too bright, And, life advancing, fancy fades her light? Ah! no—nor, yet, is day so far declin'd, Nor can time's creeping coldness reach the mind. 'Tis—that I miss th' inspirer of that youth; Her, whose soft smile was love, whose soul was truth. Her, from whose pain, I never wish'd relief, And, for whose pleasure, I could smile at grief. Prospects, that (view'd with her) inspir'd, before, Now, seen without her, can delight no more. Death snatch'd my joys, by cutting off her share, But left her griefs, to multiply my care. Pensive, and cold, this room, in each chang'd part, I view, and, shock'd, from ev'ry object, start: There hung the watch, that beating hours, from day, Told its sweet owner's lessening life away. There, her dear diamond taught the sash my name; 'Tis gone! frail image of love, life, and fame. That glass, she dress'd at, keeps her form no more; Not one dear foot-step tunes th' unconscious floor, There sat she—yet, those chairs no sense retain, And busy recollection smarts, in vain. Sullen, and dim, what faded scenes are here! I wonder, and retract a starting tear. Gaze, in attentive doubt—with anguish, swell, And o'er, and o'er, on each weigh'd object, dwell. Then, to the window, rush, gay views invite, And tempt idea, to permit delight. But unimpressive, all in sorrow, drown'd, One void forgetful desert glooms, around. Oh life!—deceitful lure of lost desires! How short thy period, yet, how fierce thy fires! Scarce can a passion start, (we change so fast) E're new lights strike us, and the old are past. Schemes following schemes, so long life's taste explore, That, e'er we learn to live, we live no more. Who, then, can think—yet sigh, to part with breath? Or shun the healing hand of friendly death? Guilt, penitence, and wrongs; and pain, and strife, Form thy whole heap'd amount, thou flatterer, life! Is it for this, that toss'd, 'twixt hope, and fear, Peace, by new shipwrecks, numbers each new year? Oh, take me, death! indulge desir'd repose, And draw thy silent curtain round my woes. Yet, hold—one tender pang revokes that pray'r, Still, there remains one claim, to tax my care. Gone, tho' she is, she left her soul behind, In four dear transcripts of her copy'd mind. They chain me down to life, new task supply, And leave me not, at leisure, yet, to die! Busied, for them, I, yet, forego release; And teach my wearied heart, to wait for peace. But, when their day breaks broad, I welcome night, Smile at discharge from care, and shut out light. EPILOGUE, to Euridice Spoke by Miss Robinson, in Boy's Cloaths. Oh, Gentlemen! I'm come—but was not sent ye; A voluntier—pray, does my size content ye? Man, I am yours: sex! blest, as heav'n can make you, And, from this time, weak woman, I forsake you. Who'd be a wise? when each new play can teach us, To what fine ends, these lords of ours beseech us. At first, whate'er they do—they do so charming! But mark what follows—frightful, and alarming! They feed, too fast, on love—then, sick'ning, tell us, They can't, forsooth, be kind, because they're jealous. Who wou'd be woman, then? to sigh, and suffer? And wish, and wait, for the slow-coming proffer? Not I—farewel to petticoats, and stitching, And welcome dear, dear breeches, more bewitching! Henceforth, new-moulded, I'll rove, love, and wander, And fight, and storm, and charm, like Periander. Born, for this dapper age, pert, short, and clever, If e'er I grow a man, 'tis now, or never. Well, but what conduct suits this transformation? I'll copy some smart soul of conversation: Shou'd there be war, I'd talk of fields, and trenches; Shou'd there be peace, I'd toast ten fav'rite wenches. Shou'd I be lov'd—'gadso—how then—no matter, I'll bow, as you do—and look foolish, at her. And so, who knows, that never meant to prove ye, But I'm as good a man, as any of ye. Well, 'tis a charming frolick! and I'll do't! Sirs, have I your consent? what say ye to't? Yet, hold—perhaps, they'll dread a rival beaux; I may be what I seem, for ought they know. Ladies, farewel!—I shou'd be loth to leave ye, Cou'd an increase of pretty fellows grieve ye: Each, like myself, devoted ne'er to harm ye, And full as fit, no doubt, to serve, and charm ye. The Shipwreck. 'Twas on the day, whose unauspicious fate, With dismal news, alarm'd Britannia's state; And, in our admiral's shipwreck, let us see, That courage cannot stem mortality! The sea's grim sov'reign, in a calmer place, Unbent the wrinkly terrors of his face: Where, stretch'd at ease, the wanton monarch lay, And, hem'd with Nerëids, laugh'd the hours away; Soft knots of unform'd coral swell'd his bed, And oozy samphire crown'd his bushy head. A watchful guard the best-arm'd fishes keep, And wind-rock'd billows lull'd their lord to sleep. While thus he lay, thick-gathering shouts were heard, From ev'ry part, the scaly nation steer'd; With sudden force, the swelling sea ran high, And moving mountains swept the darken'd sky. Disturb'd, the monarch rais'd his wond'ring head, And started, doubtful, from his briny bed: Angry, his aweful trident, thrice, he shook, And swift possession of his chariot took: Fix'd, in the stately seat, he drives, he raves! The frighted steeds divide the foamy waves; And plunging, fiercely, thro' retorted tides, Dash the drops, both ways, from their panting sides. Soon, he arriv'd, where shoals, on shoals, amaz'd, In gath'ring swarm, as on some wonder, gaz'd: Triumphant tumult spoke unusual joys, And growing numbers swell'd the savage noise. The God advanc'd; and, as he nearer drew, The shooting fishes fled his aweful view! He came: and curious, what the cause cou'd be, That had, at once, alarm'd th' assembled sea! He saw—and, starting back, declin'd his head, The well-known Clou'sly, Britain's admiral, dead! Stretch'd on the sands, the wave-swoln warrior lay, To death's wide jaws, an unexpected prey! Swift, he descends, o'erjoy'd, at what he found, And rais'd the body, from th' unwilling ground: Invok'd the soul, to re-inform his breast, The late-ejected spirit, greatly blest, Return'd, and joyful, its old seat possest, The waking hero felt a strange surprize, And, starting, open'd wide his sea-wash'd eyes: Look'd round, with curious horror, all amaz'd, While, thus, the God bespoke him, as he gaz'd. Illustrious rival of my wat'ry throne! Welcome, to regions, more than half your own! Long have my seas been practis'd to your sway, Scarce wou'd my doubtful slaves my laws obey, Unknowing, 'till, surpris'd, they saw you die, Who was most God of oceans, you, or I! Live, now, confess'd, from this propitious hour, Imperial partner of divided pow'r. Grateful, the chief bow'd low, un-mov'd, with pride, And, to the gen'rous offer, thus, reply'd: You tempt me with a pow'r, I would not lose, Had I my queen's consent, that pow'r to use. She bid me rule the seas, to my last breath, But gave me no commission after death. The French Prophets. Prophecy! no—'tis luxury of soul! No Cataracts, down religion's rivers, roll! Her streams, tho' deep, are ever, smooth, and clear, And, from their bottoms, all things plain appear: On Superstition's sea, these vessels ride, Foul, with the dashings of her muddy tide. What marks? what tokens? can they boast, from heav'n? Knowledge is, still, with inspiration, giv'n! While these the dusky paths of ignorance tread, And impudently prophecy, for bread! With counterfeited shocks of soul, they swell, And, in forc'd sweats, convulsive falsehoods tell. To heights, like this, religion wou'd not fly; Ev'n zeal grows madness, when 'tis skrew'd too high. Now law, methinks, most wholesomely severe, Might truth's fair garden, from this rubbish, clear, Which, long despis'd, may strike too vig'rous root, And, into groves of godly error, shoot! 'Twere easy, now, to sweep loose weeds away, Which may destroy the flow'rs, by short delay. So, in the bottom of some goodly plain, Flows a small rill, encreas'd, by casual rain; Near which, with careful steps, and sounding hands, Some cautious clown, with needless terror stands! Loth to attempt a nimble passage o'er, While, still, the swelling stream encreases more: 'Till faint essays, protracting time, in vain, The rising river drowns the cover'd plain; Then, stagg'ring, with affright, he gazes round, And, forc'd to pass, at last, mistakes his ground: 'Till, deeply wading, to'ward the wide-miss'd shore, The current sweeps him, and he's seen no more. Celia to Amintor. I Since God, whom we continually offend, Is still so merciful, that he forgives, Man, sure! a pitying ear may justly lend, When Woman, penitent, in sorrow, lives. II The mournful dove, when absent from her mate, Sits, brooding melancholy, all alone; Pines, and bemoans, her separated state, And all the groves can ne'er the loss attone. III So, I, depriv'd of all, I hold most dear, My much-mourn'd lover, and my tend'rest friend; Hear reason whisper, in my conscious ear, That only your blest sight my grief can end. IV Sure, if I see you not, before I sleep, A second Niobe I shall become; Fly, then, Amintor, give my woe relief, Rather, than vex you, I'll be always dumb. Amintor's Answer. I If you, too frequently provoke your God, That God, who, merciful, forgives you, still, You must expect, at last, to feel his rod, His rod, the fittest scourge of head-strong will. II But I, long vers'd, in women's winding ways, Unmov'd, with patient phlegm, their follies see; And, like men, tir'd with dirty, wint'ry days, Wou'd wish 'twere spring, but know it cannot be. III No longer, then, in spite of nature, pine; Those tiny eyes can spare no room for tears; Your wand'ring dove has snatch'd the first glad sign, And, with the peaceful olive-branch, appears. IV For, shou'd your tuneful clack be stricken dumb, More wonders wou'd arise, than you have shown; Not Celia, only statue, would become, But all th' astonish'd town wou'd turn to stone, To Miranda, after Marriage; With Mr. Lock's Treatise on Education. Since, every day, with new delight, I see, These lively little images of thee; I would their tender minds to virtue, bow, And have 'em never less belov'd, than now, Take then, thou gentle partner of my care! A glass, to show thee, what these infants are: By this just light, direct their opening way, Lest road-met folly lead their steps astray: First, teach 'em, what, to heav'n's high throne, they owe, Then—whence, on earth, the wise man's comforts flow: Teach 'em, while fortune smiles, to use her right, And nobly scorn her, when she takes her flight. The rare-found charms of friendship let 'em know, And learn, that love's soft dress is lin'd with woe. Form, with progressive care, the wid'ning mind, And, growing, bid 'em leave the world behind: 'Till, having learnt, whate'er becomes the free, You, lastly, teach 'em, how to charm, like thee. Epitaph, on a young Lady, who died unmarried. I Ripe in virtue, green in years, Here, a matchless maid lies low: None cou'd read, and spare their tears, Did they but her sweetness know. II Humbly wise, and meekly good, No earthly lover's arms she blest; But, full of grace, her Saviour woo'd, And hides her blushes, in his breast, Blowing Kisses, at the Play-house. No more, vain wretch! such trifling arts pursue, These public fooleries will never do! Love's secret flames, like lamps, shou'd bury'd lie, The very moment they take air, they die. Women, thro' crowds, can unfeign'd passion spy, Skill'd, in the rhet'ric of a speaking eye: But when, regardless of their fame, you move, Your glare of folly blinds their eye of love Augusta's Complaint to her Thames. Near the soft solitudes of Hampton's plain, Where the moist banks perpetual spring maintain; The gentle Thames has form'd a deep'ning bay, Where sportful streams, in wanton whirlpools, play: In this sweet place, the clouds no terrors wear; Here, no bold tempests discompose the air: No ruffling billows, here, assault the shore, Nor wint'ry floods, with swell'd ambition, roar; But all serene, and calm, is form'd to please, And the smooth stream reflects the bord'ring trees. Hither no winds, but zephyrous breaths repair, Soft, as the sighs of love-sick virgins are! Here, safety reigns, and, on the silent brink, Cud-chewing cattle watch their fleeting drink: While fishes, conscious of no foes to shun, Turn up their scaly noses to the sun. Here, sick with grief, which Anna's absence bred, Augusta's genius hid her mournful head: And, with low accents, speaking inward pains, Thus, to the gliding river, she complains: When, gentle stream, to shun the briny tide, Anon, thy sea-met waves shall, backward, glide; Then, gentle stream, be kind, one moment stay! And, on thy surface, bear my sighs away: Tell the great mistress of this happy isle, Augusta, stript of joy, forgets to smile: What, tho' yon tow'ring spires have ris'n in state, The city's genius feels an humbler fate! Shou'd art, and nature, toil, to make me fair, Cou'd I taste glory, and my queen not there? But oh! too fondly, I, to thee, complain! Thou know'st, unkindly know'st, 'tis all in vain! Thy streams their eye-bewitching pleasures join, To raise thy Windsor's state, to ruin mine! Windsor has other boasts, but, help'd, by thee, Grows proudly charming, and out-rivals me. But turn, sweet current! bid thy waters stray, And guide their mazy bends, some other way. Strip the gay cottage, of its boastful pride, Nor longer, thro' th' imperious prospect, glide! So, to thy care, this glory shall remain, T' ave given Augusta back her queen, again. Grave Thamesis, thrice, shook his dripping head, And, slowly rising, from his oozy bed, While the hush'd stream, with awful smoothness, ran, He, to the mournful genius, thus, began: Yon Queen of cities ought to learn content; Her gratitude shou'd these complaints prevent. Have I not rais'd her, to an envy'd state? Is she not rich, licentious, pow'rful, great? And wou'd she, thus, make every bliss her own? And must our Anna live, for her alone! Do not yon sun-beams, with unwearied race, Whelm their enliv'ning light, from place to place? Why, then, must Britain's glory cease to move, And bless her world, with her divided love? Go, go, retire! your tears, with pain, I see, And this complaint, renew'd, shall dang'rous be! He said : and, gliding, from her presence, went, And sad Augusta strove, but could not be content. To the unknown Author of the beautiful new Piece, call'd Pamela. Blest be thy pow'rful pen, whoe'er thou art! Thou skill'd, great moulder of the master'd heart! Where hast thou lain conceal'd? or why thought fit, At this dire period, to unveil thy wit? O! late befriended isle! had this broad blaze, With earlier beamings, bless'd our fathers days, The pilot radiance pointing out the source, Whence public wealth derives its vital course; Each timely draught, some healing pow'r had shown, E're general gangreen blacken'd, to the bone. But fest'ring, now, beyond all sense of pain, 'Tis hopeless, and the helper's hand is vain. Sweet Pamela! for-ever-blooming maid! Thou dear, unliv'ning, (yet immortal) shade! Why are thy virtues scatter'd to the wind? Why are thy beauties flash'd upon the blind! What, tho' thy flutt'ring sex might learn, from thee, That merit forms a rank, above degree? That pride, too conscious, falls from ev'ry claim, While humble sweetness climbs beyond its aim? What, tho' religion, smiling, from thy eyes, Shews her plain pow'r, and charms, without disguise? What tho' thy warmly-pleasing moral scheme Gives livelier rapture, than the loose can dream? What, tho' thou build'st, by thy persuasive life, Maid, child, friend, mistress, mother, neighbour, wife? Tho' taste, like thine, each void of time can fill, Unsunk by spleen, un-quicken'd, by Quadrille? What, tho' 'tis thine, to bless the lengthen'd hour, Give permanence to joy, and use to pow'r? Lend late-felt blushes, to the vain, and smart, And squeeze cramp'd pity, from the miser's heart? What, tho' 'tis thine, to hush the marriage breeze, Teach liberty to tire, and chains to please? Thine, tho' from stiffness, to divest restraint, And, to the charmer, reconcile the saint? Tho' smiles, and tears, obey thy moving skill, And passion's ruffled empire waits thy will? Tho' thine, the fancy'd fields of flow'ry wit, Thine, art's whole pow'r, in nature's language, writ? Thine, to convey strong thought, with modest ease, And, copying converse, teach its stile to please? Tho' thine, each virtue, that a God could lend? Thine, every help, that every heart can mend? 'Tis thine, in vain! thou wak'st a dying land: And lift'st departed hope, with fruitless hand. Death has no cure—thou hast mis-tim'd thy aim; Rome had her Goths—and all, beyond, was shame. On Corinna's first Attempt in Poetry. With eyes, un-brib'd, by your enchanting view, I trac'd, impartial, your soft numbers thro'? Your loose-dress'd fancy, in each sparkling line, Gilds the gay current of your deep design. Your poem, strongly fine, and softly bold, Is silkworm's labour, spun, with threads of gold. Go on, bright maid! nor doubt the world's applause; Wit, arm'd with looks, like yours, the critic awes! Tho' years may knit, and lengthen your success, Think not your youth will your due praise oppress: Ev'n the broad sun, when, first, his glories rise, With struggling tincture, streaks the eastern skies, But soon, thro' heav'n's enlighten'd orbs, the conquering lustre flies. The Valentine. Why, be it so! it matters not what name Yon river bears, since, still, it flows the same! Whate'er I call you, this, I'm sure, I feel, No name can speak of you, with half my zeal! In vain, love's meaning, this or that, we call, The comprehensive lover takes in all! Yet, since, to custom's bent, we all incline, You shall, to please you, be my Valentine. And, since my charming trifler asks a gift. The mystic value of this present, sift. Accept these gloves, and, if they worthless seem, Learn, thus, what pleas they bring, for your esteem. Their spotless white prefer'd their choice, to me, As the best emblem of your chastity. Their smoothness may, almost, the honour win, To represent the velvet of your skin: Their suppleness, which, join'd with strength, you find, Is the just fabrick of your well-mix'd mind. The kid, that wore 'em, had some faint pretence, To be the type of your sweet innocence: How, then, can I a fitter present chuse? Or you these emblematic gloves refuse? One stronger reason, too, my fear has found; Women, they say, oft slight the breast they wound. And, when dark absence shades us, from their view, They look not after us, but seek out new: To shun this fate, these gloves your lover sends, That you may have him, at your fingers ends. The Revenge. High, on the summit of a craggy rock, Whose harden'd sides resist the billows' shock; Whose cliffy brow, mens eyes, with horror, view, O'erlooking, proudly, land, and ocean, too: There stands a roomy cave, by nature, made, To knit, in just embraces, light, and shade: Its spacious mouth the sun's up-rising greets, Admits his lustre, but repels his heats! No glaring gold, on this rough portal, shines, But creeping ivy round its entrance, twines: Wall-flow'rs, wild-thyme, and juniper, grow, there, And with their odorous influence, feed the air: Surrounding groves, at distance, graceful rise, Shades, for the little songsters of the skies. And, near the cave, a torrent, gushing o'er, Dashes the sea, beneath, with tributary roar. Stretch'd, on a bed of fresh-blown roses, here, Serene, the region, and the prospect clear! Rests, when grown weary, by her summer toil, The wakeful genius of our happy isle! Hence, her unbounded sight can trace the shore, And look, high-posted, the proud ocean o'er! And hence, while hostile winds grow hoarse, in vain, Guide safe her wide-watch'd Britons, 'cross the main. 'Twas here, of late, on an ill-fated day, The awful nymph, o'ercharg'd with business, lay, Now, swelling winds deficient sails to fill; Now, soft'ning tempests, with reductive skill, Now, with wide blessings, looks she thro' the isle, And calls forth harvests, with a fruitful smile. Then, 'twards Augusta's spires, she loves to lean, And guide stray'd comforts, to Augusta's queen! But, whether tir'd, with her long line of care, Or lull'd to rest, by the unacted air, A rising languor o'er her senses creeps, And, in a fatal hour, the guardian sleeps. Now was the time! the prompted Gallic foe, Call'd out, to stride a chance-invited blow, With shameful odds, in strength, advanc'd, to meet Th' unfearing convoys of a British fleet! With deadly shock, th' unequal squadrons join, And death-wing'd fires fly swift, from either line. In jetty pomp, black terrors force their way, And sulph'rous smoak puts out the eye of day. Just in the thunder of the growing fight, The waking genius started at the sight! In sad surprize, she rolls her sparkling eyes, Springs from her couch, and to the ocean flies! Arriv'd, incumbent on the ruffled air, She sees rude globes the floating forest tear: Her sons, o'ermatch'd, like men, untaught to yield, Scud, unresolv'd, about the wat'ry field: The spacious seas, with scatter'd vessels, charg'd, To double length, the breaking line enlarg'd. Averse to fly, nor deaf to safety's call, They hang, like scatt'ring clouds, about to fall. But while the foe, encourag'd at his view, Pressing, triumphant on, wou'd dare pursue; Again, united, they the fight restore, Again, dart vengeance, fiercer, than before: Again, the big-mouth'd cannon rends the sky, And the unconquer'd suff'rers rush to die. Thus, while the hunted panther, spent, with fight, Looks round, distrest, and meditates a flight; If then prevented, he, with sudden roar, Turns back, and dyes the field, with hostile gore; Disdaining life, upon the spears, he flies, And, heap'd on piles of victims, proudly dies. All this the trembling nymph, with grief, beheld; At length, her care the victor's force repell'd: Then, wastes no time, the ruin'd to deplore, But guides the rich remainder safe to shore: Thence, to the cave, with threat'ning transport, flew, Revolving, what her hop'd revenge shou'd do! There, while depress'd with melancholy thought, Her working fancy diff'rent projects taught; From heav'n's bright orb, a youth, divinely fair, With wings extended, cleav'd th' enlighten'd air; Just, at the mourning charmer's feet, he stay'd, Look'd lovely on her, bow'd him low, and said: Mourn not this little loss, nor blame thy fate; Decreed revenge shall on thy wishes wait: Look up, bright maid! read Ramelies, writ there, And pay thyself large int'rest, for this care! He said: and, strait, his wings their plumes advance, And bear him, glitt'ring, thro' the wild expanse The ravish'd nymph beholds his starry flight, And, fill'd with promis'd glory, blest the sight. To the Flattering Incognita. I. Keen! but obscure destroyer! cou'd you see, How your wit's warmth has fledg'd my flutt'ring soul! You, who have oar'd, wou'd also pilot me, And not thus tempt the race, yet hide the goal! II. You bid me come, but, ah! you say not where, Such soft, such soul-inspiring graces live! Tell me but that, and I'll, at once, be there, With all the speed, that hope-wing'd love can give. III. You're, now, the ignis fatuus of desire! You tempt my wishes, with a wily spark; But the first step, which brings me nigher, While, to reach you, I aspire, Strait, you vanish—and 'tis dark. Jostling, in Snowy Weather. Forgive me, Chloris! nor my rudeness blame, Strange, as it is, this frost has bred a flame! Driv'n from your breast, I glow, with new desire; And melt, like straggling snow, that falls on fire. Had you been black, you might have shun'd this blow; For diff'rent colours wou'd each other show, But, oh! you're fair, and cold, and soft, and every way like snow. Psalm lv. Verse 6. O, that I had Wings, like a Dove! Then would I flee away, and be at rest! O That my feet were wing'd, as my desire! I would not, then, thus tediously retire: Thus slowly rise, that, while to mount, I try, I sink, beneath the weight, from which I fly! Could I, like eagles, sail upon the wind, Might curses catch me, when I look'd behind! 'Till shaking off this cumb'rous load of breath, My soul reach'd heav'n, nor stop'd to bait at death. The Amorous Scrutiny. I If 'tis not love, what is it, that I feel? If 'tis, he's far more mighty, than he's blind! Whose tickling wounds no suff'rers wish to heal; Who pains each breast, he strikes, in diff'rent kind. II If good the cause, why the effect so ill? And why do I, thus torn with grief, remain? If bad, such torments shou'd not cure, but kill! Whence, then, proceeds the sweetness of my pain? III If I consent to burn, why do I grieve? And, if I don't, ah! what avail my tears! Oh! life in death, how I my will deceive! And waste my blooming hope, with empty fears! IV Who can define the odd effects of love? 'Midst stormy tempests, in a leaky boat, No rudder left, no compass, right to move, Toss'd to and fro, unknowingly, I float. V Scarce can I tell how I wou'd wish to be! While rich in health, I pine, and long to die! In view of death, I struggle, to be free! I freeze in summer, and, in winter, fry. Liberia, watch'd at Midnight. As from a window, in the wane of night, With starry views, I feasted wand'ring sight, I saw Liberia watch the rising day, Whose lustre was to light her friend away! That friend, whose kindred passion serv'd to prove, The promis'd ardour of her brother's love! That brother's love, which, tho' it meets regard, Remains uncrown'd, with the yet-hop'd reward! As, in some overcast and dismal day, We start, to see the sun, at once, break way; So, at that hour, to see such charms advance, When ghosts are said to rise, and fairies dance! With more than usual pleasure, fill'd my sight, And mix'd some wonder, with much more delight! While, arm in arm, they trac'd the garden walk, The love-hush'd air hung list'ning to their talk: The dancing breeze, which had, 'till then, been gay, At their appearance, sigh'd, and dy'd away. As they drew near, the moon more strongly shone, To view their brightness, not to boast her own. A gen'ral stillness seem'd to sooth their cares, And nature's face grew sad, to suit with theirs: Shrill-barking Mopsy smother'd her own joys, Fearing to drown her mistress' charming voice: Liberia spoke, but seem'd to speak in vain, As if unable to describe her pain! When grief is true, no words its force can paint, A silent sorrow far outspeaks complaint! A thousand leaves the destin'd sisters took; A thousand unspoke meanings fill'd each look: Oft, they gaz'd, upward, to the dawning sky, And curs'd th' expected hour, for drawing nigh: If now, thought I, some gentle zephyr blew, Thus shou'd it whisper, as it round her flew: Think, since your pitying soul does absence hate, Absence from you, must sharper pangs create! Think, if, to lose the sister, gives you woes; What, losing you, the brother undergoes! Who, every night, from your lov'd presence, sent, Does long repeated absences lament! And, if this parting does yourself displease, Be taught, by sympathy, to give him ease. On Eliza's design'd Voyage to Spain. To Spain! forbid it, heav'n! oh, think no more, To bless, profusely, that abounding shore! It can, to souls, like thine, no pleasure yield, To waste manure, on the too fertile field: Our beggar'd soil, at home, alone, shou'd share, The gen'rous influence of Eliza's care! Since Spain, high-treasur'd, grasps the golden west, Oh! let thy Indies, be, by us, possest! On Occasion of some Verses, from Eliza. I Charmer! no more, by partial friendship, led, To humble themes, mis-tune thy heav'nly lyre! Wide as the poles, thy sweeping pinions spread, And soar to subjects, worthy of thy fire! II Chain'd short, by fortune, I, unwing'd, remain, A fruitless meaner, far beneath thy praise: Warm'd, by thy heat, I poorly wish, in vain, For means, to fan thy earth-enlight'ning blaze. III O! were the world not deaf, and fortune blind, How wou'd thy joy-drest muse, encourag'd, shine! How wou'd the gen'ral chorus of mankind, To prove their wit, concur, in praising thine. IV If poets prophets are, the time shall be, When I, by means unguess'd, shall reach the pow'r, To stretch the world's eye wide, thy muse to see, With star-bent flight, like some new Juno, tow'r. V Mean while, what other theme deserves thy pen, But death-edg'd satire, on this stupid age? Where poetry, un-nerv'd, in worthless men, Has giv'n a woman all Apollo's rage! PROLOGUE. Peace to the muse's empire—let the stage Shun civil war, and only act its rage: While rising strife divides our neighbouring state, To prove our taste abhorrent of debate, We soften feuds, with a pacific scheme, And take a good old treaty, for our theme. Far be the omen, that attends the name! Treaties, in England, are of losing fame; In Bocalini's scale, they treaties lay, The more thrown in, the lighter, still, they weigh. Tho', says Comines, in war, these English beat, Morbleu, we Frenchmen souce 'em, when they treat. Such satire might be just, in ages past, But no bad politicks have strength, to last. How can it, now, be truth, when Britain's kings Stretch over Europe, their protective wings? See the first seeds of jarring purpose rise, And mark the growing guilt, with guardian eyes. 'Till forc'd accord the promis'd harvest sweeps, And all, at once, is peace—and murder sleeps. Away, with parties, and their partial fears; Whence our long calm, of twenty peaceful years? Why so remote, do these state thunders spread, Nor break, in dang'rous nearness, o'er our head? Half thy lov'd blessings, liberty, would cease, Cou'd war, and rapine, force the fence of peace: But, like a safe-guard mountain, stands the throne, Nor hear we of a storm, 'till 'tis o'erblown. How greater, far, this pow'r to save, than kill, The wish how god-like! and how vast the skill! The hand of ruin we, with ease, employ, And every puny tyrant can destroy: But, like the God, who bids the waves be still, To curb the rage of struggling war, at will! To say to monarchs—Let your discord rest, I will not see the world, I guard, distrest. —This is, indeed, to rule—Such princes claim, If not a sounding, yet a shining, fame. Faction but helps the greatness, it defies, And lives, but by the mercy, it denies. To Lord George Grahme; On his Action, near Ostend, on the 24th of June, 1745. 'Twas finely tim'd! third Edward's brightest days Had, from such captains, claim'd increase of praise: But, now, 'tis tenfold greatness, thus, to rise, Where sense of vict'ry, lost in purse-craft, lies! Where war but pilfers, and but bags contest; And public honour is the public jest. At such a time, to dare the sneerer's joke; To rush on danger, when but foes provoke; Un-brib'd, by profit's impulse, fight for bays, And court no præmium, but his country's praise. 'Tis prodigy! 'tis out of nature's road; 'Tis scorn of prudence, and offence to mode. Shake, Dunkirk! and retract thy bold extent, Doom'd to due dust, stands each proud battlement. Swell high, propitious surge, hide Tournay's stains, And wash off insult, from our cow'd campaigns. Look up, ye sea-driv'n ghosts! whom pleas'd Toulon Saw sink, in fruitless fight, forgot too soon! O'er the salt wave, triumphant thunders hear, Hail the wish'd vengeance, that, at last, draws near! While France starts wide, and wonders, whence it came, Pale, to her trembling genius, point a Grahme! Tell her, 'tis his, to feel his country's fire, Hold her past fame in view, to urge it higher: Tell her, re-waking glory waits his call, To pour atonement, o'er the pride of Gaul. Reclaim asserted ocean's question'd sway, And teach the doubtful nations to obey. Say, pitying heav'n! that sav'st a blund'ring state, Whom hast thou late inspir'd, to lend us weight? Blow, ye broad winds, expand his op'ning light, Tell us, whence rose he? Do his country right; Born, on thy bleaks, Albania! nurse of kings! From gen'rous stock, this gen'rous Scyon springs. Son of thy soul, Montrose! There, known, too well! Prop of a crown, when three lost kingdoms fell! Far be the omen from thy filial fire, In every wreathe, but death's, transcend thy sire; Far, from thy great forefather's suff'rings, rais'd, For more than all his virtues, lov'd, and prais'd: Down, thro' time's tide, transmit his length'ning fame; O, born, above his fate, to lift his name. Oh, Mallet! this was he—sweet heav'n-fac'd boy! Thy friend congratulates thy conscious joy: Pride of thy care, thou led'st his earliest youth, To court plain glory, white as robeless truth; To scorn dark lifts, which men distinction call, And climb, self-sinew'd—or, not rise at all, Courage, by nature, his—thou taught'st him taste, And innate warmth, with polish'd brightness, grac'd. Breath'd o'er his list'ning heart reflection's breeze, Gave him desire to know, with pow'r to please: Thine, half the triumphs of his rising fame! And Britain's future Flag shall bless thy name. In a blank Leaf of a Book, sent to Miranda. Go, happy book, ? Who, void of life, art from life's cares so free, Thou canst, before my lovely charmer, lie, Unscorch'd, by all the light'nings of her eye. 'Midst her inspiring touch, thou canst remain, Tasteless of pleasure, and secure from pain: While absent beauty breaks thy author's rest, And hope, and fear, by turns, distract his breast. My angel mistress must, henceforth, be thine, And I devote thy offerings, to her shrine: On varied themes, divert her wand'ring eye, As o'er thy honour'd leaves, her glances fly; But, when her thoughts, on softer subjects, rove, And lead her, where thy pages talk of love. Oh! then, so mindful of thy author be, To bid her, in a whisper, think on me. The Progress of Wit; a Caveat. Tuneful Alexis, on the Thame's fair side, The ladies play thing, and the muses pride; With merit popular, with wit polite, Easy, tho' vain; and elegant, tho' light: Desiring, and deserving, others praise, Poorly accepts a fame, he ne'er repays; Unborn to cherish, sneakingly approves, And wants the soul to spread the worth, he loves. This, to the juniors of his tribe, gave pain, For mean minds praise, but to be prais'd again; Henceforth, renouncing an ungracious Baal, His altars smoak not, and their off'rings fail: The heat, his scorn had rais'd, his pride inflam'd, 'Till what they worship'd first, they next defam'd; Depos'd, at length, from Pindus' top, he roll'd, While insect witlings, pleas'd, his fall behold, And each cold-croaking Heliconian frog Leaps scornful, and bestrides th' unreigning log. Far-fall'n Alexis, who so ill aspir'd, Sick of successless war, from wounds retir'd, Where, while in sleep, his sorrows ebb'd away, And, hush'd in darkness, indignation lay; Fancy, fair mistress of the poet's mind, For ever changing, yet for ever kind; Soft, o'er his dreams, her formful radiance shed, And his rapt soul thro' heav'n's thin purlieus, led; Seated beside the star-invading dame, Whose steeds, wind-footed, paw'd the lambent flame. High, as a widow'd lover's grief can climb, Her air-built chariot rose, and hung sublime. Unveiling, thence, the world's bleak wastes, below, They saw the stream of life, beneath 'em, flow; Dim, from the sable sea of birth, it rose, In a slow, silent, sullen, dread repose: For, round th' emerging source, that glimmer'd, pale, Mountains of midnight darkness roll'd a veil: But, as the evolving surge swell'd into day, Quick'ning, it mov'd, and roar'd, and rush'd away. Broad, on the left, from low oblivion's shore, Quicksands, and rocks, reach'd half the current o'er: Lucid, like truth, the treach'rous water shone, And, o'er gay gilded shoals, ran, tuneful, on; Pebbles of gem-like hue, with painted pride, Glow'd, thro' the wave, and burnt, amid the tide. Wantonly kind, the sun's enliv'ning beams Shower'd, in light spangles, on the dancing streams: While insect nations, gnats, and wasps, and flies, Ting'd, in the rainbow's ever-changing dyes, Sheathing their stings, and smiling, like the fair, Peopled the sunshine, and adorn'd the air. Less lively, on the right, the stream's deep flow, There, no false colours mix'd their varied glow; No gawdy bottom catch'd the downcast eye: Above, no flutt'ring insect wing'd the sky: Serenely solemn, all—One equal whole Flash'd not upon the sense, but touch'd the soul: Instead of rocks, green islands flourish'd, here, Silent, and fruitful, as the full-grown year; In place of flies, grave swans of snow-like hue, Sweetly majestic, in slow circles, flew: But, tho' these isles the distant prospect chear'd, No bay, no port, no landing-place appear'd; Kind birds, alone, gave entrance o'er the mound, Nor, from the stream, below, was inlet found. Then fancy, thus—Fame's future regions, these, Where nothing surfeits, yet, where all things please; Here, memory stands fix'd, while time runs on, And worth blooms fresh, when life itself is gone; Danger keeps distance, soften'd spleen grows kind, Ambition temperate, and love refin'd: Nor pride, nor jealousy, can, here, annoy, Nothing is ecstacy, tho' all is joy: Peace without languor, labour, void of pain, Glory unenvied, and unslander'd gain. Tho' diff'ring, thus, the stream's unsocial sides, Yet, one broad gulph absorb'd the double tides; From birth, devolving, death's blind sea, below, Boundless, and formless, snatch'd the mingled flow; Both rounding oceans, backward, seem'd to tend, And vast, beneath, their sable surges blend: But far more frightful this!—whose dark profound, A depth eternal! life wants line to sound: Unbottom'd shade roll'd, loose, o'er swallowed light— Fancy grew giddy, nor sustain'd the sight: But, starting into fear, transpos'd remark, And sought the source, less dreadful, tho' as dark. Thick, on the rising stream's emitted tide, Millions of shapeless bodies seem'd to glide; Whose breathing bulks, to life, and motion, blown, Shot into human forms, compleatly grown; Mix'd rank, and sex, sprung thro' the liquid jet, But, pouring outward, clear distinction met; Some wading, naked, trod the slipp'ry plain, Some cut the fluent wave—some, tir'd with pain, Falling to float, or wade, neglected, fell, And sunk, unsnatch'd at, in the troubled swell: To others, rising happier, and serene, Fortune, dark bustling, pow'r, obscurely seen, Reach'd, with blind bounty, and, with hasty hand, Thin boats—and buoy'd 'em o'er the shining sand: Of diff'rent form, these boats—a single oar Distinguish'd some—Some wing'd their sides, with more: Others, with oars and sails, conjoin'd, made way, And mow'd the murm'ring surge with sweepy sway: While some, slow pole-men, o'er their toil, reclin'd, Push'd their check'd barks, and, lab'ring, lagg'd behind. While some essay'd to cross, and veering wide, Wou'd with strong stem, the stubborn stream divide, And slowly slanting, sought the silent side; Swift, to the shelvy shore, light gallies flew, As the fierce channel's rapid current drew, 'Twixt rocks, and whirlpools, driv'n, obliquely gay, And, thro' the shoaly sunshine, danc'd away. Caught, by the gulphy void, that gloom'd, below, These, from the current's fair descending flow, In-drawn, at once, by darkness swallow'd o'er, Sunk, from their sunny scene, and rose no more: Still gap'd th' unclosing deep; o'er millions gone, Yet, still insatiate, hourly swallow'd on! Titles, distinctions, forms, rush mingled down, Not levity itself wants weight to drown: Gamesters, beaux, casuists, jinglers, jesters, drinkers, Fox-hunters, politicians, and free-thinkers, Prudes, devotees, coquets, grave, light, young, old, In one mixt night, the covering waves infold: Swept from the noise they sought, to rest they shun'd, They plunge, for ever, into death's profound: While abler pilots, who, resolv'd, stood o'er, And, edging broad, gain'd slow, the safer shore; Snatch'd, from their sinking seats, were borne to land, By watchful swans, whose wings the surface fann'd: There, on green islands, reign'd, escap'd from cares, Lords of a blooming world, for ever, theirs. Wide, o'er the scene, Alexis winds his eye, Swift, as the progress of the gliders by; A strange confusion rose—of all who past, With earnest emptiness, and barren haste, Few, cross the flood, repugnant, strove to steer, Fewer had strength of oars to hold them near! Tir'd, by the current's ill-resisted force, Or, bulg'd by envious prows, which cross'd their course, The boldest keels, pursuing, or pursu'd, Entangling, and perplex'd, were lost in feud: While others, heedless of their sleeping oars, Drove, in light negligence, nor shun'd the shores; But, pendent o'er the helm, each shoal explor'd, And snatch'd, in transport, shells, and stones, on board: Or, leaping wanton, catch'd the glittering prey, That buzz'd, and gambol'd, in their sportive way. Mean while, most mournful, of the motley scene! Cherish'd effect of pride, and food of spleen! Boat over boat, destructive passage made, And weeping pity mourn'd defective aid: Sailing presumers, pressing, proudly on, Bore down each envied rower, who nearest shone; The oar-wing'd vessel ey'd, with dumb disdain, The creeping pole-man's slow-availing pain; And, lordly wanton, with invasive beak, Sunk the faint struggler, criminally weak! He, too, in concert with superior hate, Loth to exert less guilt, than match'd his state, Triumphant, in his turn, sought equal prey, And, o'er the naked wader, forc'd his way: Alexis, pondering, in suspended thought, What meaning all these mazy mixtures taught, Sudden, a shout, from every distant side, Eddied the air, and broke the back'ning tide; Acclamatory thousands rose alarm'd, All eyes attracted, and each hearing charm'd; Pointing in transport, all their helms forsook, And, on one object, hung their length'ning look. Down, from the gloomy source, in side-long float, Proudly descending, mov'd a glitt'ring boat; Her silken sails a colour'd radiance threw, And ting'd the sunny beams, thro' which they flew; While oars of silver, dash'd the wat'ry spray, That rain'd in gemmy show'rs, and dazzled day: High, on the painted stern, a youth appear'd, Who rather happily, than strongly steer'd; Faint, and unstriking was his anguish'd mien, Sadden'd by sickness, and o'ercast with spleen; Yet, from his eyes, there beam'd a living light, Keen, and intent, as a fir'd eagle's sight: And, from his voice, (for, as he sail'd, he sung) Such magic sounds of melting music sprung, That the hush'd heav'n all downward seem'd to bend, And, against nature, the charm'd earth ascend. Careless, he look'd, yet, heedful of his way, Broke the kind current's un-obstructing sway, That kiss'd his oars, and hasten'd to obey: Scarce was his course oblique, for each glad boat, That, envious, stem'd all other's rival float, Fix'd, and enchanted, when this youth drew nigh, Hung on his passing notes, and help'd him by: The Muses row'd him, and the Graces' care Trimm'd his light sails, and spread them to the air; In his boat's bottom, green-ey'd Envy lay, And serv'd, as ballast, while she clog'd his way: Down, from her chariot, light-wing'd Fancy flew, And o'er him, loose, her starry mantle threw; Pleasure, praise, beauty, 'twixt his shrowds, trod gay, And danc'd the measur'd moments soft away: Sportful as Zephyrs, in his smiles, they strove, And the young loves forsook their mother's grove. Thus fortunate, thus favour'd, and thus bright, Luckily negligent, and aptly light, He touch'd no shoal, safe rounded every rock, Despis'd all danger, and sustain'd no shock; 'Till, to that calmer coast, approaching nigh, And gliding, 'twixt green islands, safely high, Circles of hov'ring swans, with joyful note, Clapp'd their broad wings, in triumph o'er his boat, Charm'd, that, so soon, he reach'd their solemn side, E'er yet one third of the stream's length was try'd. Steering, from isle to isle, with joyless awe, Thin, o'er each height, their white-rob'd lords he saw, Pleas'd, without transport, bow the palms they bore, To hail his passage near their silent shore; Cold, and uncharm'd, he sought his fav'rite croud, Immensely distant, now, tho', late, so loud: All was serene, the air was hush'd around, The waters calm!—Lost ev'n his musick's sound! Back to the left, impatient looks he cast, And long'd for ev'ry shining insect past; Distant he saw them, wings o'er wings, display, And, in light chases, thread the colour'd ray: Eager, for these, contending pilots strove, And catch'd them, careless how their vessels drove; Then, with their trophies, dress'd each gaudy sail, While humming drones, in swarms, their fortune hail: Record past leaps, foretel their next essays, And buz, melodious, in the fly-men's praise. Warm'd, and misled, by this false fire of fame, His beaming eyes, with emulation, flame; And have I, recreant, thus renounc'd a field, Where baffled danger can such glory yield? Lives there a catch-fly, of yon vent'rous press, More brave than I am? or, who fears them less? Shew me the warring wasp, whose threat'ning wing I dare not strike at, and provoke his sting! Swans! give me way—your shoreless islands keep, Too safe your clime is, and too calm your deep; I chuse a rapid glory, not a slow: Shoals are sought harbours, where these jewels grow. He said, and rising, push'd, with liquid sweep, Th' inverted helm, and goar'd the groaning deep: Flaming erect, re-sought the surgy side, And bounded, threat'ning, o'er the foaming tide: Sailing athwart the swarms, and skipping high, He snatch'd, triumphant, every tempting fly: Gave his loose rudder, to the current's claim, And drove, disdainful, thro' his rival's game; Press'd by invaded wasps' excited stings, He warr'd, revengeful, on their falling wings: Thro' dust of slaughter'd gnats, he fought, in shade, And squeez'd them, deathful, on the wounds, they made; Fleets of cold opposites, from all sides, join, And, wedg'd, against this general foe, combine: Vainly, indignant, they resist his sway, Yet block his passage, and obstruct his way: Still, tho' he stagnates, he the fight maintains, While drones, applausive, with their ductile strains, Homage the rising hero's new renown, And prince of fly-catchers the champion crown. The swans, mean-while, which, from the calmer side, Forsaken, saw him trust the fatal tide; Mournful, with pendent wing, his triumph griev'd, And wish'd his wasted vigour less deceiv'd: Trembling, they mark'd his vessel, downward bent, Hang o'er th' engulphing ocean's dark descent, While he, regardless, still, new trophies won, And, bent to conquer, saw not what to shun. FANCY, still busied, still enamour'd, staid, And, still concurring, lent his rashness aid; To her, far distant, touch'd Alexis cry'd. And with strain'd voice, to reach her notice, try'd: “O! save him, warn him, bid him turn, and think, “Let not his bark, in yon black ocean, sink! “Teach me to call him, by his pow'rful name, “Point out his danger, quench his devious flame; “Rash spleen of heart, that could such war advise! “Blind rage! to lose himself, and catch but flies! “Oh teach my tongue his name” —Then fancy heard, And, smiling, at her chariot's side appear'd: “Why dost thou ask, she cry'd, what nations know, “Even, all, whom wit, or worth, inspire, below? “His is a name, that dwells on ev'ry mind, “Tunes every tongue, and sails, with every wind! “Not surer is that river life's extent, “Or by those oceans, birth, and death, are meant; “Not surer fortune is that dark pow'r's name, “That left, oblivion, and that right side, fame. “Than, that no son of wit dares justly, hope, “Fame dwells in folly's paths, but thou, O POPE! Alexis, starting, heard his own lov'd name, Felt his pride shrink, and blush'd, with conscious shame! Pitch'd from the chariot, lost to fancy's call, And, had not waiting judgment broke the fall, Contempt's cold vale had caught him, wak'd, and stunn'd, And deep intomb'd him, in his own profund. The Art of Acting. Dedicated to the Earl of Chesterfield. Why sleep the silent pow'rs, that guard the stage, While yawning opiates lull the tastless age? Shall trite cold themes catch fire, from wit's essays, Yet, hov'ring chillness damp theatric blaze? Mourn it, ye sons of spleen, whose hands (mistaught) Tore up this seed of sense, this plant of thought: Whence reasoning shoots might bloom life's garden o'er, And weedy wildness choak her walks no more.— Horror (at alien woes) by genius, mov'd, To sense of home-felt bliss, be, there, improv'd: Wit's ent'ring hand dissect sedition's breast, Shew the malignant springs, and call forth rest. There, the touch'd heart, in secret silence chid, Might learn to hate the guilt, it, once, but hid: There, scorn, from note of pity's praise—catch grace, Start, and pause, conscious—in pride's slack'ning race. There, heedless beauty, warn'd of man's false fire, Might chain down wav'ring love, and edge desire: Each maid's mild eye correct her heart's warm trust, Dull perts grow pensive, and false thinkers just. There, (now) sits Mummery, thron'd on passion's Urn! There, noisier fires, than Wit's (unbright'ning) burn: There, vice, with laughter, shares divided rule, And only serious purpose marks the fool! Vain the lost pray'r, that courts a Muse's aid, By foes un-tasted, and by friends betray'd: Patrons immers'd, 'twixt faction's rapid tides! Poets, in flattery's—pow'r, absorb'd in pride's! Gone is the learned leisure, once, rever'd, And the still voice of genius sighs, unheard. Happier Ierne! mourn our drains no more; Richly reveng'd, thou drain'st a nobler store. Poor, in our turn, see Wit's lost channel dry, Robb'd of her Fountain—for thy full supply. Yet, while home ruin wrings the heart distrest, 'Tis recompence, to fall, for others, blest: Less thy doom'd distance (soul of absent joys!) Pains the shook realm, whose hope it half destroys; Conscious, thou goe'st, to warm one sister's fears To transports—lasting as the other's tears. Long, in sad silence, on the willows hung, Now! she resumes her Harp, for praise, new strung: Tires her tun'd hand, to pour her grateful soul, Wide, as her chief can charm, from pole to pole. Genius, from ages, hers, 'midst want, and wrongs, How will she, now, transcend past poets songs! At once, of every nation's grace made free, By every added muse, bestow'd with thee! There, 'midst the toils of empire's manag'd weight, Law's lights extended, and embellish'd state; Find a calm hour, to lend the Stage thy care, And times, unborn, shall feel a Stanhope, there. Dark'ning, mean while, our muse's lamps expire, Blank is their prospect, and unfann'd their fire: Friendless, neglected, laugh'd at, and unfelt, No now-crown'd conq'ror cares, where Homer dwelt. Banish'd from court, from senate, city, scene, Wit's sons, all tongue-tied! mute, even Harlequin! Yet, let the thinker scorn such dumb suspense, Nor (flattering custom) sneak his aid from sense: Wing'd for the future, o'er the present rise, Spurn the time's cloud, and strike benigner skies. Not always, shall ambition's muddied brain Work to perswade—yet, hold example vain! Bribe, to each further'd interest's venal cue, Yet dream, Diversion, all the Stage's view. The time shall come (indulge it soon slow fate!) When power shall taste, that wit can think, with weight: The time shall come—(nor far the destin'd day!) When soul-touch'd actors shall do more, than play: When passion, flaming, from th'asserted stage, Shall, to taught greatness, fire a feeling age: Tides of strong sentiment sublimely roll, Deep'ning the dry disgraces of the soul: Pity, fear, sorrow, wash'd from folly's foam, Knock at man's breast, and find his heart at home. Then, plaintful grief shall drop her whiney drawl, And heart felt anger nerve th' insensate bawl. Then, shall the moving art old powers possess; Wake valour, call forth joys, and stamp distress. Then, shall the player take pains, in pleasure's right, Sweat, for his praise, and labour, to delight: Then, shall he thank the hand, (in death, long cold) That fir'd his languor, and his fame foretold. Tasteful, ev'n now, there want not some choice few, Whose hope-warm'd hearts can hail the distant view: Hearts, that the subject's lov'd importance know, And feel the fire, they bear, with conscious glow. Why was the actor stain'd, by law's decree? Lost time's recov'rer! truth's awak'ner, he! Passion's refiner! life's shoal coast survey'd— The wise man's pleaser, and the good man's aid. Precept, and practice, in one teacher, join'd, Bodied resemblance of the copied mind: Nature confirms, art dignifies his claim, And only cant's low crawl defiles his name. If, but by comprehension, we possess, And every greater circle holds the less; No rank's high claim can make the player's small, Since, acting each, he comprehends them, all. Off, to due distance, half ye stalking train! Blots of a title, your low tastes profane! No dull, cold, mouther shares the actor's plea, Rightly to seem, is transiently, to be. How shall this gole be reach'd, that, seen most nigh, Still glides more distant, from th' advancing eye? Like the sky's sea-dipt arch, heaven's fancied bound, For ever sail'd to, and, yet, never found. How shall trac'd practice hit th' untrodden way? Where life is travell'd out, in arts to stray. Arduous the task, and asks a climbing brain; A head for judgment, and a heart for pain: E'er sense, impress'd, reflects adopted forms, And changeful nature shakes, with borrow'd storms: E'er ductile genius turns, as passions wind, And bends, to fancy's curve, the pliant mind. Mark, when th' expanding seed, from earth's moist bed, Starting, at nature's call, prepares to spread; First, the prone Root breaks downward—thence ascend Shot stems—whose joints collateral boughs extend: Twigs, from those boughs, lend leaves—each leaf contains Side-less'ning stalks, transvers'd, by fibry veins. So, from injected thought, shoots passion's growth; No sprout spontaneous, no chance child, of sloth: Idea lends it root— firm, on touch'd minds, Fancy, (swift planter!) first, th' impression binds; Shap'd in conception's mould, nature's prompt skill Bids subject nerves obey th' inspiring Will: Strung to obsequious bend, the musc'ly frame Stamps the shown image.—Pleasure, pity, shame, Anger, grief, terror, catch th' adaptive spring, While the eye darts it! and the accents ring. See art's short path!—'tis easy to be found, Winding, delightful, thro' the mazy round! Tempt the try'd skill, to no sole proof, confin'd; Shift the short shadowings, o'er your figur'd mind: Mournful, recal some friend's lamented fate, Sad, on each feature, hangs the mind's felt weight. Seek you strong sense of Joy? Looks, first, impart— Then, the nerv'd stricture bounds it from the heart: Does rage inflame? No visage can conceal, What the mark'd muscle bids the spirit feel: Still, as the nerves constrain, the looks obey, And what the look enjoins, the nerves display: Mutual their aid, reciprocal their strain, Will but commanding, face, and nerves explain. Light'ning, and thunder, so concurring, strike, One their joint origin, tho' form'd unlike: So, to the look, th' attentive nerves reply, As, from the flash, succeeding thunders fly. 'Tis cause, and consequence; nor flows more grace From beauty's smile, than the touch'd actor's face. Poize the rule's practice; turn it o'er and o'er; Nor think it tedious, tho' conceiv'd before: 'Tis but, to look, and will.—Th' imprinted eye Moves the struck muscles, and the limbs comply: Gesture is meaning's Ape—grave, furious, gay, Changeful, as cloud-form'd shapes, when winds make way; Imag'd conception, first, but face inflames; Then, the mein paints it, and the tone proclaims. Is there, who doubts an art, thus briefly shown? Call out proof's pow'r, and make that art his own: Bid him, with mournful brow, swell sounds of joy, Half the mock'd sense th' unbracing nerves destroy: Tun'd to the tearful eye's retentive woe, Rapture's check'd phrase shall quench its fiery glow: Painfully plaintful, each flat note shall die, And his look's anguish, give his words the lie. Next, while soft smiles restrain his voic'd essay, Bid angry sounds give Rage its thund'ring way; Vainly, mouth'd menace swells th' attempted storm, Kind, as consent, th' unfright'ning accents form: While his look frown'd not, sense cou'd sound but sweet; No nerve, concurring, help'd th' unsinew'd heat. But had his eyes th' impatient fire display'd, Each note had snatch'd it, and each step convey'd: Thus, one plain practice paints whole nature right, And all her changeful pictures move delight. Is there, who loves not Joy?—There, then, begin, Search the soul-pleasing passion's power, within, Find your Smile's force, before some faithful Glass, Heedful, to let no faint impression pass: There, to touch'd gladness, thought-form'd features train, 'Till each crisp'd fibre feels th' enrapt'ring strain: Then, (stretch'd) behold your op'ning forehead rise, Back'ning, in boastful sense of sparkling eyes. Broadly majestical your breast expands, Brac'd your press'd joints—neck, knee, feet, shoulders, hands, Treading on air, each step new soul displays, Your limbs all lighten, and your looks all blaze: Then, speak,—joy answers; every sound its own: Musick, and rapture, mix'd, in transport's tone! Fall, from this height (ah! 'tis but fortune's road!) Down, to deep sense of sorrow's pungent goad; Damp your loose feature's, into thought's distress, Fade fancy's gloss, to dim-ey'd wretchedness: The sad look sick'ning, strait the spirits break, Unbending nerves grief's lax impression take: Faint hangs the clouded eye—short steps drag slow, And every heedless gesture bends with woe: Now, to the heart-touch'd sense, the voice complains, And sighing pityers catch th' infectious pains. Say, should some slack'ner of the passion's care, Form'd for gay flights, and struggling from despair; Bow'd, from his native bent, to doubt's new part, Find Fear's cold cast assign'd a fearless heart? What could he do? where house th' intrusive guest? Let his Eye lodge him—'twill prepare his breast. From the soul's optic, shoots th' admitted shape, Nor lets one tim'rous wavering start escape. Fear is elusive sorrow, shunning pain; Active—yet, stop'd—it dims the doubtful brain; Spirit snatch'd inward, stagnating, by dread, Slow, thro' the limbs, crawls cold, the living lead: Form'd to the look, that moulds th' assumer's face, His joints catch tremblings—life's moist strings unbrace; This road, and that, th' alarmful passion tries, Halts, in the motion—flutters, in the eyes; Checks the clipt accent's hesitative way, And, on th' evasive muscles, hangs delay. Anger is pride provok'd, (so felt, so known) Strange! its stage influence is so faintly, shown! Yet, with what absent sense of all its flame, See we rage meek—fire cold—and fury tame! Bid the face, red'ning, warm'd idea take, Strait, the soul's wildfires all obstruction break: Stung, by inflicted thought's imagin'd pain, Hard heave the muscles, rolling eye-balls strain: 'Twixt the clos'd teeth, indignantly, supprest, Or, storm-like, loud, out pours th' unguarded breast: Slack'ning, exclaiming, swift, slow, restless change, Wings the voic'd tempest, in its whirlwind range; Quick turns, and startings, face, and air, deform; And thick, short breathings paint the infelt storm. Nor sea, nor life, eternal Tempest sweeps, Hush'd calms succeed it, and the thunder sleeps: Such, the soft, silent tide, that floods the mind, To mov'd Compassion's pain-touch'd warmth, inclin'd: Aidful idea springs to pitied woe, Thence, every quiv'ring sinew learns to glow: Back, from the panting bosom, to the eye, Kind, sigh-wing'd dews, in soft sensation, fly: So, from earth's op'ning breast, in flow'r-dress'd May, Steams the sipt fragrance, to the sun's felt ray; Lightly sustain'd, to morn's faint clasp it clings, Yet, oft (let go) falls back—oft, upward, springs: So learn,—to steal soft Pity's copied grace; Languor's moist cloud marks, first, the mournful face; Then, hope's kind tension warms the musc'ly mein, Dragg'd diff'rent ways, contending contrasts lean; Clash'd looks, 'gainst movements, paint internal fight, 'Twixt the heart's anguish, and the help's delight: Then, touch'd attention's hark'ning hush creeps round, And breathless mouths devour th' expected sound. Nature loves change—Cold night succeeds to morn: And pity's dark'ning opposite is Scorn: Far be this brow-stretch'd arrogance of air, From misery's doomful claim, in sons of care.— Ah! minds, (too apt) turn but the look within, We find pride's image, there, as sure, as sin! Yet, with such byas, rolls man's will from right, That search, first, misses, what is most in sight: Else, how unneedful, to describe a rage, No player wants power to feel—but on the stage. Cautious, (life's speaking picture) wear that stain, Rightly to show, be thine—but not retain! Scorn is calm, careless, anger, flagg'd of wing, Brush'd sense of harmless wrong, too weak to sting: Safe in suspended power, eas'd warmth disclaims Exertion—and, with slack remissness, flames: Now smiles—now frowns—yet, both, with eye serene, While half-strung nerves play springs of painless spleen. Close-following scorn,—Amazement ought to rise; Angels feel Wonder, men should dare despise! Born to mistakes, and erring out life's span, Man—as if heaven were his—looks down on Man. Say, then, what wonder is—trace its taught cause: Mark its true features, and make known its laws: Wonder is curious doubt,—Will's check'd retreat, Shrinking from danger, it prepares to meet: 'Tis fear's half brother, of resembling face, But fix'd, unwavering, and bound down to place: Earnest, alarmful gaze, intently keen, Notes the weigh'd object—yet, distrusts it, seen; As in pale churchyards, gleam'd by silent night, Shou'd some cross'd spectre shade the moon's dim light, Shudd'ry, the back'ning blood, revolving swift, Cloggs the press'd heart—stretch'd fibres fail to lift: Lost, in doubt's hard'ning frost—stopt motion lies, While sense climbs, gradual, to the straining eyes. Hatred is sullen fury, long retain'd; 'Tis willing mischief; warily restrain'd: 'Tis thought's corrosion, acridly perplex'd, 'Tis self in pain, lest others live, unvex'd. This to touch vivid—(pencil! pleas'd, and free, Paint the quoil'd serpent, thou abhorr'st to see) Veil the malignant leer, that burns with spite; Bid the brow's lour o'erhang the sick'ning sight: Swell the blown cheek—th' unopening lip restrain, Stretch'd, the wide nostril marks th' impatient pain. Ardent, yet, heedless—half th' averted eye Skims the loath'd object, and disdains it nigh. Hard, back-brac'd nerves, in fett'ry fervor, toil And the curv'd system heaves, in check'd recoil. Haste from taught pain—shun hatred's baneful shade, And to love's sunshine, lend the muse's aid. Love is intense Desire, by rev'rence, check'd; 'Tis hope's hot transport, streak'd with fear's respect: 'Tis passion's every soul-felt power, disjoin'd, 'Tis all th' assembled train's whole force, combin'd. 'Tis like soft air, through which admitted light Peoples pleas'd fancy, and lends shape to sight: Yet, like that air, disturb'd, man's quiet breaks, Tempests his reason, and his triumph shakes. You, who infuse this power, must, first, have felt: No heart, unmov'd itself, bids others melt: Yet, wou'd chalk'd outline sketch th' imagin'd grace? Dumb earnest gaze, tongues o'er th' unvocal face: Soft'ning, in apprehension's awe-check'd air, Each limb beseeches; each slow step's a prayer: While high-brac'd raptures imag'd pride confess, Meekness sits guardian, o'er the mild address: Doubt, dissipating hope, to blanche desire, Hangs the mind's curb, upon the body's fire. Snatch'd from the scene, claim this the Box's care: It paints, and warns, for every beauty, there: But, there, love's shafts, (of late) all pointless, lie, Blunt, from bold meine and dead'ning in the eye: Naked of heart, and hateful of Delay, Erring time-short'ner! meeting wish half way! Woman, outstradling art's old lureful skill, Mann'd o'er with Invitation, drives back will: Falls her past price, owns patient hope buys dear, Hawks for quick market, and hawls chapmen near: Talks loud, struts, elbows, calls a grace a Fool; Dress'd, like a scarecrow, manner'd, like a mule: Pall'd, the press'd cheap'ner dreads th' out-blustring air, Eyes the braw'd swaggerer, and rejects her ware. Turn, coarse conceiver! all, unsex'd, by mode, Maid, that trot'st, uglying, in the monster's road! Proud, yet, immodest! light, rude, witless, pert, Bold, jostling, hoid'ning, blushless, pow'rless flirt! Emptier, than air, thy coloury gugaws play, While every hour's new forms push old away: Trifler! for cards, and contradictions, born! Panting for conquest—yet compelling scorn! Lab'ring from nature, to grow loath'd by art, And, for man's manners, forfeiting his heart! But hold—contempt, wrong plac'd, becomes unjust; Perhaps, stage whiners gave love's friends disgust: For, (goblin like) there, lovers walk, unshown, Talk'd of, in every play—yet, seen, in none. Lost, in unfeeling, cold, affected drawl, They touch no tenderness, attempting all? Lump'd, lazy, lifeless indolence—one cause— And one, th' admiring fool's misjudg'd applause. Why shou'd pain sweat for praise, proud ease can win, By the rais'd footstep, and exalted chin? By the heav'd halt, that swings its load along, Clumsily solemn, and serenely wrong? By the big, broad, round, mellow troundling troll, That means no passion, and conveys no soul: Half swells, then sinks, like sails of ships becalm'd, A dry, dead, sweet—man's mummied voice embalm'd. Shame on the whineling, sleep-inducive, tone! Not, by such glow-worm glimpse, love's fires are shown: Heart, voice, mein, visage, all, pay love their aid, Cupid exacts more strict alliance made; 'Twixt the mind's states, than, once, 'twixt Europe's, he, Who bound all princes—yet, left none unfree. Not such loose treaties please th' all-buckling God, Punctual, he yokes tun'd sounds, to meaning's nod: Pardons no void, vain, voluble harangue, And hates to hear the unaiming bowstring twang. Say, female shades of love, who haunt the stage, What fiend, close-treading, tags desire with rage? If in your hospitable bosoms bred, Th' unresting fury thrives, by beauty fed, Tell the dire name—But if you, silent, feel Th' impressive tooth, and no gnaw'd thought reveal: Speak, tell-tale muse.—Thou shar'st th' envenom'd bite, For Jealousy ne'er sleeps, when poets write. The Janus Jealousy two faces wears, Each diff'ring, apt, as form'd, by diff'rent cares: While infant-wing'd, the callow harpy lies, Too dim for daylight; too unfledg'd, to rise: 'Tis doubt-mix'd anger, struggling to confide, Floating, half sunk, on pity's pleading tide: Here, hope-fed softness sooths the affiant heart, There, rage, vindictive, bids the spirit smart: 'Twixt the two wav'ring scales, by turns, deprest; The eye's short wand'rings mark the mind distrest: Languidly strung, slow-nerv'd, half-sinewy strain, Paints an unsettled, half-determin'd, pain: Whence rous'd resentment, catching hasty flame, Cool'd, by met pity, blushes into shame: But, does weigh'd Proof confirm th' ideal wrong? Then, the eye lightens—and the brace binds strong: Not vengeance burns more turbulently stern, Tho' (thro' it) pain'd affection sighs concern. Thus, has the muse, in passion's changeful dress, Led ent'ring art through nature's dark recess; Fair, to her eye, one source of action shown, Whence every branch'd meander flows her own: Brief, let precision's scale contract the view; Then, grasp it, mem'ry, and remit the clue. Previous to art's first act—(till then, all vain) Print the ideal pathos, on the brain: Feel the thought's image on the eyeball roll; Behind that window, sits th' attentive Soul: Wing'd, at her beck, th' obedient Muscles fly, Bent, or relaxing, to the varied eye: Press'd, moderate, lenient, Voice's organ'd sound, To each felt impulse, tones the tuneful round: Form'd to the nerves, concurring Mein partakes, So, the mov'd actor moves—and passion shakes, The Dedication of the Beech-tree; Occasion'd by the late Discovery of making Oil, from the Fruit of that Tree. High, in thy starry orb, Great ruling planet of our brighten'd sphere, The muse invokes thee, and demands thy ear! Her HARLEY's ear! O yet, confess the name! Thy titles borrow lustre from thy fame. Fearless, to fall, my rein-loos'd fancy soars, High, as thy deeds, nor common aid implores: Let conscious fawners blow their smoaky fire, And vainly bid th' unlist'ning gods inspire; My muse, disdainful of their sullied wings, Views the vast height, and, dauntless, upward springs, Inspir'd, like angels, by the worth, she sings. Yet, oh! mistake not my aspiring lays; They wou'd but speak my duty, not your praise: Praises, like yours, who lives, and does not know? The poorest debtors count the sums, they owe; But I, impatient of the growing score, Wou'd pay you something, e'er I owe you more! Accept, great guider of the stormy state, An off'ring worthy of the brave and great: Accept, what heav'n, propitious for your sake, Smiles on this peace-bless'd land, and bids her take: This art of old, had been some altar's due, Now, fir'd, with purer zeal, she kneels to you. That awful pow'r, who guards our Anna's throne, And to that Anna, made your virtues known, To place such worth, above all wish'd controul, Bless'd the long labours of your peaceful soul; But one thing wanted,—Fam'd Minerva's tree, The gift of peace, from gods to men, like thee, That oleous plant, the pride of sunnier climes, Chief in the poets songs of antient times, Too long prophan'd, for thy chaste brow to wear, Fled the cool influence of the Northern Bear. Heaven's voice was heard—deficient nature groan'd, Felt his new will, and the correction own'd. The humblest forest of our favour'd land, Grew proud beneath this bounty of his hand, Confess'd the secret, he vouchsaf'd to teach, Disdain'd the olive, and enthron'd the beech. Hail, happy tree! wou'd after ages know, To whom their sons thy oily harvests owe, Oxford's lov'd name, deep on thy bosom, grave, Who, from his country, did his country save; Who gave our harass'd land its long-wish'd rest, And forc'd unwilling nations, to be blest; Whose known esteem of arts gave birth to thee, Omen of greater, which, e'er long shall be. Thy pious hand, which made war's thunder cease, Shall cultivate the nobler arts of peace; 'Till murm'ring faction owns, with thankless joy, 'Tis far more great, to build, than to destroy. Nor shall thy rising country's son's alone, Thy wiser care of their lost int'rest own. The boundless blessings of thy lib'ral hand, Shall shed their influence, on our fruitful land: The long-mourn'd absence of th' inspiring plant, Whose pow'rful juice ungrinds the edge of want, Whose sov'reign strength makes glad the lab'rer's toil, Shall now, no more reproach our injur'd soil: Our teeming glebe, if I a-right divine, E'er long, shall swell, with floods of gen'rous wine; France shall no more her courted vineyards boast, But look, with envy, on our northern coast, Which now enrich'd, with matchless oil and corn, Unequal'd vintages shall soon adorn. Nor this alone! on, on, prophetic fire! Tho' boundless is the flight, disdain to tire; Unwearied, all his glorious aims pursue, 'Till sickning envy dies, to shun the view. Fir'd with the sure presage, methinks I see The struggling east resign her morian tree; The roughest Dryads of our oaken isle, Charm'd with the gentle stranger, learn to smile; The dancing boughs their breezy homage pay, The oak nods welcome, and the beech gives way. And now, glad spring, by rising warmth, renew'd, The various insect seeks its leafy food, Spins out its little life's industrious thread, In grateful toil, to find its feeders bread, Dies a rich recompence of female care, And leaves its silken treasures to the fair; The fair, long mindful, whence th'advantage came, Shall teach their sons to speak, by lisping HARLEY's name. From views, like thine, with thy vast knowledge, join'd, What blessings may not happy Britain find? Fierce emulation shall new pow'rs impart, 'Till ev'ry wish grows possible to art; Rivers shall roll, where now, huge mountains grow, And tides, new channel'd, wonder how they flow. For thee, proud Thames his wealthy arms shall spread, And take the swift Sabrina to his bed. Enamour'd Trent shall love-sick Avon meet. And distant seas, in mix'd alliance, meet. Dear, to thy care, ev'n th' unhoping SCOT Shall bless the union, and hold fast the knot; Britain no longer shall explore, from far, The costly magazines of naval war; High on the mountains of her northern shore, The gummy pine shall shed her pitchy store; Tall firs, which, useless, have long ages grown, Shall fright the seas, and visit worlds unknown; 'Till the check'd sons of Norway's timber'd state, Learn love, by force, while we disarm their hate. And, here, rejoice, ye Caledonian shores, Whose empty strands my friendly muse deplores: Shortly, strong fleets shall plow your stormy seas, And wealth's warm breath your icy ports unfreeze! The Belgic spoiler shall no more pursue Those finny shoals, which court your guides, and you; Summon'd to greatness, worthy of your fame, Nor ill-supported, in the gen'rous aim, Approaching time shall see you, justly brave, Assert the right, which God, and nature, gave. Then shall that fire, which, now, your bosoms fills, With virtues, useless, on your barren hills, New-nerve the grasp of application's hand, And rouse the latent glories of your land. Wide lies a tract, beneath the sunny line, Where rays direct with burning lustre shine; Where ribs of silver bind the sea wash'd plains, And virgin wealth, unmix'd with av'rice, reigns. This, the proud Spaniard never yet possess'd, So much has heav'n the happy natives bless'd; Reserv'd for British rule, their isthmus, free, Divides the northern, from the southern sea. Nor this, the hapless tract, the direful spot, Dear, to the brave, the unpermitted SCOT. North of that sad, that ill-remember'd shore, A happier work does happier hands implore. Here shall the sons of our advent'rous land, Through unborn ages, stretch decreed command; Here shall they draw both oceans to their sway, And thro' repugnant mountains cut their way: 'Tis done! methinks, I hear their cannons roar, Hostile repiners shun the envied shore, And round vast capes, a tedious course pursue, While we, and only we, possess the new. Hence shall the shorten'd distance guard our health, Secure our traffick, and increase our wealth: The western bullion, to our merchants, sold, Shall send us weight for weight, in eastern gold. Nor, then, shall Asia's aromatic store Pile the proud markets of a neighb'ring shore; All shall be ours, and, while we all maintain, No bloody war shall the chaste vict'ry stain. O blind prophaners of obtruded bliss! Who, wanting soul, to fathom depth, like this, Instead of owning debts, you cannot pay, Strike at the friendly hand, which points the way, Forgive, thou great inspirer of my song, If, ending here, thy wider views I wrong; If arts more wish'd, or worlds less known there were, Thy ne plus ultra had not rested there. The End of the Third Volume.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ORIGINAL POEMS. Epilogue, writ for Mrs. Pritchard, in the Play, call'd the Massacre of Paris. Poor, once fam'd Lee, when he compos'd this Play, Brainsick, and touch'd, on Bedlam's borders lay, And 'twas no wonder—for, in sober sadness, Church Massacres wou'd scare even saints to madness. O, ladies! heaven forbid such serious frights! Such strange dead doings—on your wedding nights! Kill us, with kindness, let 'em—if they dare: But downright dying—ah!—what bride could bear? These are thy trophies, France!—no Briton dares, With tame, cold murder, stain the cross he bears. In day's broad face, o'er seven French mounds he clambers, But stabs not, in the dark, in sleep's still chambers: No base assassin plots defame these nations, Ours are more open, honest, associations. Generous, in anger, with reluctant glow, Our brave, blunt soldier beats, yet spares, his foe: Weeps, while he wounds, with conscious pain, to see Kings, call'd Most Christian, more like Turks than he! Well! 'tis no matter—still let France deceive us— Sound strength, and English knocks, can soon relieve us. Yet, while this faithless Prince, on all sides, plies us, Let us not teach his tradesmen to despise us: Cover'd with guile, let art's low tricks be theirs, Ours to repel their arms, and spurn their airs; May that mistaken taste be starv'd to reason, That does not think French fashions—English treason. Souse their cook's talent—and cut short their taylors, Wear your own lace—eat beef, like Vernon's sailors, Or good sound Mutton's manly juice delight in, Your Chicken's à la daub's no food for fighting. Seem we not slaves, while to their language leaning, We teach our son's first words to lisp French meaning? War, on their modes,—or bow, beneath their feather; Sweep out French tongues, tails, fops, and faith, together. Laugh at their Jargon, bid disdainful Satire Blot from your stile, tapis and recognoitre: Goût, and escort—to taste and guard,—restore, And act, and talk, plain English, evermore. Nor let the youth, who means for spoil to scramble, Trip, like patch'd, petite maitre's puny amble![imitating the modish effeminate tread]Step out, bluff Britons—not disgrace good eating: Light pumps, and short, minc'd steps, half bode retreating. Man, on his mien, should carry firm defiance: Yet—let his modest heart sigh soft compliance. So, shall his mistress grasp her fame's defender, And waste no wishes, on a false pretender. Fix'd, as her oaks, shall Britain's freedom flourish; And France and Spain, chimeric tempests nourish. Fir'd, with this foretaste of my country's zeal, Verse is (alone) too faint, for what I feel! Help me, ye souls of Musick—come—and sing, Tune my touch'd heart's plain prayer—God save the King. [Waving her handkerchief, as a signal for Mr. Beard, and other singers to enter.] PROLOGUE. In this faint age, when British growth is missing, And dapper beaux want stilts to climb to kissing; Ill dares an author hope your pardon granted, Who gives a man, more woman, than he wanted. But I, to comfort him, have been declaring, You can forgive all sins, you take your share in. Let me look round—aye—'tis my firm persuasion, Your calls, that way, outgo your best occasion. Two wives! what then—suppose 'em two and twenty, Spendthrifts shou'd never frown, on other's plenty. And pray, what right have you, to rail at changing, Who still, quit old, for new—and live, for ranging? Just warm one's hopes, to glowing expectation, Then, baulk one—in the nick, of provocation: Here's, your first spouse, good reverend, Mrs, Drury! By turns, the object of your smiles, and fury, Has, for an age, been yours, in form, and fashion, Lull'd every care, to sleep—sooth'd every passion; Yet, almost in her view, you quite renounce her, For a huge, rampant, Covent-Garden bouncer! Fie, fie, 'tis English policy—it savours Of want of Wit, not to divide your favours. Now here, now there, might half disguise the treason, Or, a wise wife wou'd wink—who found such reason. But, to forget entirely, while you wander, Who claims, at home, the rights, you loosely squander, O'erturns a matron's peace, however stable, And proves, (if not ungenerous) you're unable. Well! after all, when we no longer please ye, 'Tis want of sense, and policy, to teize ye. Time may befriend our hopes—and, till that blessing Comes, in its turn, once more, to our possessing; Grant us one modest prayer—and, from that minute, If e'er we murmur, say,—the Woman's in it: Give us your evenings only, when we claim ye, Lie, where you please, all night—we'll never blame ye. Prologue, intended to have been spoken, at Lady Jane Grey. All danger past, in Greece, I'm hither come, Post haste, to have one timely stroke, at Rome. Papists! have at ye—slaves of superstition! I'll rack the rackers—in my Inquisition. When (in return for tricks, your priests have show'd us) We burn th' all-burning Pope, for ballance ow'd us, Rome, says we persecute—Oh! front amazing! She—that so oft, set Smithfield fires a-blazing! We—roast a Pope of straw—for recreation;— She—lumps us to the Devil—and roasts the Nation. Dark, sowre, proud, bloody,—turbulent and vain! Bodies, and Souls, must burn—or bear her chain. Preaching, or plotting—Rome's true plan is Power: Blessing, she robs!—and worships—to devour! Blood is her taste—Religion—her disguise: Her sons are murd'rers—and her Saints—are Lies: Faith's alchymist renown'd for transmutation, She finds rank heresy—in reformation. Oh! what obsequious babes imbibe her lectures! No busy searchers, they! no bold suspectors! Pliant believers! they, by wholesale, swallow: And, like tame geese—(implicit cacklers!) follow. Thought, truth, sense, Scripture—all—are guides, that stray. Nothing, forsooth's infallible—but they! Ask this Church Cockatrice, what right it crows by; Darkness, you'll find, is all the light, it goes by. Hoodwink'd, at whooper's hide, to hunt salvation, They guard their back-held nose from demonstration. With force resistless, faith's disputes they handle, And cut short wrangling—by bell, book, and candle. Meekness their cant—humility their skreening— Pride their true deity—and Fire—their meaning. Brimstone and flames, choak Heaven's high road to glory, And parboil pilgrim's tails—in purgatory. Sins a poor Girl?—(save with some crown-cropt brother) Down goes she, unabsolv'd—'midst smoke and smother: Spite of her horse-hair smocks, and straps of leather, Hot, half-way fires must singe—the lord knows whither. Heavens!—how we players should feast their well-fed fury— If Purgatory's hundreds reach'd—to Drury! Oh, Britons! 'tis no joke—repell th' assaulters. Let no prig popery e'er be-farce your altars; Bravely disdaining slav'ry e'en to Princes, Freedom's fierce horse, at a Pope rider winces, Proud of the manag'd bit—when law directs it; But skakes it from his teeth—when force injects it. Bless'd be our King, forever bless'd our church! Pure church! that lov'st no pomp, and fears no search! Long, by contempt of Rome's proud mummery, fir'd, Be thy plain truths, and honest zeal, admir'd: Long live the faith—that holds not reason deaf! But saves by virtue—and dissects belief! Builds, on strong, moral Rock—loves decent Form, Preaches internal peace—and stills each storm, Trusts heaven—with aweful hope—and holds it odd, By man's dark passions—to decypher God. Prologue, for Mr. Cibber, in the Fatal Bribery. Debtor and Creditor th' account begin, But then, comes joy—wife—misery—death—and sin. While, from these varying lights, fierce fires we raise, Lend but attention, and your tears shall praise. Poor (at first opening) seems the plot, we chuse; But no felt indigence unfir'd the muse: Insolvent pris'ner bears no aweful sound; Yet, hope strong buildings, from that humble ground. Few, are the public stains, that tinge the fame, Of this brave, rich, good-natur'd, nation's name. Yet, one there is—from time's long license grown, That blots out pity, and turns flesh to stone. 'Tis the deaf rage, that, where hard wants oppress, Doubles th' insolvent suff'rer's dire distress, Stung by this wasp, past friendships lose their weight; Warp'd estimation wears a face like hate! Suspended mercy bids affliction smart, And, in a scale of stint, immures her heart. Self, yet unreach'd by woe—made proud by gain, Blind to disaster, and insulting pain; Short-sighted ease hugs her own lot secure, And marks no diff'rence, 'twixt the base, and poor! Flings from calamity, turns short on grief, And to the prison, (live grave!) refers Relief. So, for a while—triumphantly, severe, Tow'rs the big insult—and disdains to hear; At last, comes disappointment home—Then, starts Touch'd sense—and wonders! at men's cruel hearts! Then, (self, still, upmost) the rows'd sleeper shakes— And, insolently, hopes—compassion wakes! But scorn (close waiter!) kicks the scorner's heel, And he, that shun'd to hear, vouchsafes to feel. Too late, he feels!—the eye, that wakes for all, Foredoom'd his anguish, and enjoys his fall; Points, to his trembling view, that Wiseman's school; That God-given law th' all-temp'ring Golden-Rule! Bids him thank bitterness—for due despair, And—since he could not pity—learn to bear. From our last age's Play's exemplar aim, Present, and past (we find) too much, the same: Stern, unrelenting, interest's partial will Reign'd, then, resistless:—and it reigns so, still. How happy were th' effect, could miseries (here) From pride's correction; mourn'd by pity's tear, Teach the dry rock to melt, in pain-touch'd flow! And ease th' unhoping crowds—that sigh, in woe! Epilogue, to the same Play, spoke by the Person, who represented Amelia. I've 'scap'd, to-night, two terrible disasters, My honour's indignation—and my master's: And heaven best knows, what hapless, hole can hide me, If (to crown all my woes) your help's deny'd me. Ladies!—you see, how much expos'd our sex is: Sleeping or waking—some sad chance perplexes. Man's a more wily Snake, than mother Eve's was; In his own shape—and others to—deceives us: Hungry devourer! never tir'd, with snapping;— Shun him, with open eyes, he'll catch us napping. Rise, fall—run, stay—standing upright, or lying, One way, or t'other, he's forever trying— And, how to 'scape him, if I know—ne'er let me Break thro' th' entangling nets, that thus beset me. Now, Gentlemen!—to your own thoughts, appealing, (Fitter, I doubt, for making wounds,—than healing!) —What would you have have poor woman do with Honour? When Danger heaps such monst'rous loads upon her! —D'ye think, in conscience now—half-wak'd, half-weary, With frights fore-gone—for one's departed deary— T' had been so strange a crime?—or worth such pother? —In darkness—to mistake one's buss for t'other? Pray think on't—put yourselves behind the curtain: What can't be cur'd must be endur'd—that's certain. 'Tis a fair question;—and 'tis plainly ask'd ye: Answer it—or confess, I've overtask'd ye. Suppose me, bound, in sleep's soft silken fetter, And one of your dear selves the dark besetter. Sight has no eyes, at midnight—and for touches, Joan (says the proverb) in the dark's—a Dutchess. For my part—I can't find, we've any senses, Can furnish such attacks, with fit defences: If Wedlock's towns lie open, (foes too nigh 'em) E'en, let the Liege Lord Husband fortify 'em, —Not safe in one's own bed, without concluding, That one of love's stray gnats will be intruding, Let trusty spouse, when bus'ness sends him packing, (Safe bind, safe find)—leave no due caution lacking. Let him place round, lest some night insect eat us, Nettings of wyre—to keep of Man-musketa's. Bold must besiegers be, who, then, dare venture, Where they must storm two forts, before they enter! I see some judge-like eyes, that look too sprightly, To miss a She law-point, put to 'em rightly. Is mine the court's decree?—I humbly move it, That, if your hearts affirm—your hands approve it. An Entertainment, by Way of Epilogue, in the Characters of Wisdom, and Love. [PALLAS descending with Helmet, and Spear, to an Overture of warlike Musick.] Pallas. Pallas, the guardian of the slighted stage, Brings a complaint, that fires her into rage: Stung to the soul, she cannot—will not, bear it, But for the sex's honour must declare it. Of fifty powder'd beaux, here, wedg'd, behind, Not one fast friend can fading woman find! They rail—they joke—nor their distaste conceal; Unconscious of your power, from head, to heel! Cupid! thou airy God of empty dreams! How fall'n thy empire! and how false thy schemes! Why weighs the sex, too light, in love's own scale? And why, thus faintly, does thy power prevail? [Cupid descends, with his bow, and his quiver, to a change of soft musick. Cupid. Goddess! I heard thee—thy reproachful pride I, thus defy—and shade thy towery side! I, too, dare strutt! [they cross disdainfully] Pallas. —Proud toy! his wings he spreads: But his blunt arrows, all, have lost their heads! Go, helpless, tasteless, thoughtless, powerless, Chit, Thou ghost of passion! and thou jest of wit! Where are thy boasts, of touching man with pain? And, what is Woman, now?— Cupid. —Vain—sweetly vain. Pallas. 'Tis thence love languishes— Cupid. —unjust complaint. Love languishes, because desire grows faint: And that, proud scorner! I must charge on thee. Thine are their minds.—their beauties busy me. Of late, e'en there, my power has been unknown; All their new modes of charming are—their own. I taught the sex their art, of wounding sure, But they themselves have taught the arts of cure. Each amorous scene, that fills this active space, Sees a light laugh, disarm some angel face: No serious sounds can their light hearts engage, Sweet sep'rate Actors! they despise the stage! Attention is beneath a Beauty's care, Her whirlwind spirit scatters sense in air. Absent, in presence, they unlistening sit, Too gay for meaning! and too fine for wit! Or, when they grieve, they bring their own chagrin, Nor feel the foreign sorrows of the scene. Impatient, five, long, acts, they loll, reclin'd: And sigh for Plays of a more winning kind, All, of one mind, of late, agreed—they fall, Victims, to one gallant. Pallas. —But one, for All? Sure! he must be some rarity! Cupid. —No doubt, I'll draw his picture, and you'll point him out. A painted, thin, smooth, pale-fac'd, tottering beau! Deaf, dumb, blind, lame—too weak to stand or go! From hand to hand, kind souls! they stoop to shift him; For he can't stir a limb, but as they lift him! Yet, more than love, or wit, their hearts he moves, And changes oft'ner, than they change their loves! Pallas. And do they like this monster? Cupid. Aye:—and will. Pallas. What! all? Cupid. All—all Pallas. What is his name? Cupid. —Quadrille. Pallas. It has been said, that love and folly, fit: But you're a Joker, Cupid! and a Wit; Let us, each, singly,—our perswasion try: Take you one half the house—the other I. Cupid. Alas! 'twill never do—'Tis fruitless zeal: Passions, that move that sex, must make 'em feel. All—you can say, they laugh at— Pallas. Boy, be still, Yours, let the Ladies hear—the men my will. [Advances to the front of the stage] If, Gentlemen! you disregard the Player, Or hear him, coldly, and with-hold your care; For your own sakes, support his powerful Art, That lets in love, and pity to the heart. Here, first, imprinted sighs an entrance find; And the soul opening, leaves disguise, behind. Taught by the scene with gen'rous warmth to glow, To feel another's joy, and share his woe; Your fair adopts each suff'ring lover's view, And by the worth of heroes, measures you. But if, regardless, of your cause, and ours, You join the enemy's triumphant powers; —Sly Matadores will each man's hope betray, And melt his mistress down, the quite wrong way. —Now Cupid, to the Ladies [stepping back] Cupid. —E're I go, I'm sure, my labour's lost— Pallas. —Despair not, so. [Cupid comes forward] Cupid. Ladies! your rivals in gay climes, complain, That winds and frosts, assail your charms, in vain; 'Twere glorious envy! could they, also say, That, while their taste quits love and wit, for Play, You, noblier-minded, and of sense more true, Scorn to be loveliest, and not wisest, too! That, form'd, like them, to be the themes of wit, You not, like them, forsake—but cherish it. Think of your glory, Ladies! [Pallas comes forward, again.] Pallas. —Gentlemen! Think of your int'rest—and forsake the scene, At your own peril—Wives, who, from Quadrille, Return, with ruffled face, and fighting will! Would, at the scenes soft fire, new point their charms; And bring redoubled transport, to your arms. Cupid. Enough—The prudent urge no wish, too high. Pallas. E'en Love can counsel well when Wisdom's by! Cupid. YOU, Goddess boast your power in man's strong breast; But I know woman's weaker bosom, best. Still what they will, they will— Pallas. Then, be it ours, Perswasion failing, to exert new powers. Let both henceforth, our diff'rent influence join, And see reluctant beauty forc'd to shine. Cupid. Great Pallas! I embrace thee:—Be it so— [embracing Goddess of arts, and arms! receive my bow: [gives the bow Take, and new-point, Love's every blunted dart: [gives the arrow And tipt with reason, wound, and heal, the heart. Pallas. Cupid!—associate God, of smiles, and joy! Take, in exchange, this spear—no feath'ry toy! And now, where'er thou see'st a fair one's breast Flutter, too lightly,—touch—and give it rest. But, where some solid virtue sighs, in vain, Wound, with my lance: and dignify the pain. Cupid. Now, woman's empire's fix'd! Pallas. Confirm it, Jove! Cupid. Love softens Wisdom— Pallas. —Wisdom strengthens love. PROLOGUE. Ladies and Gentlemen, since all transgression Is promis'd pardon, when it makes confession: Know, that our Play—a sheaf of foreign gleaning, Dreads, to be damn'd, for its excess of meaning. What tho', to court kind judges, our translator Has let loose Scandal, and unbridled Satire! Vain are his arts—that play was built for sinking, Where none can laugh—but at th' expence of thinking. In a free nation, 'tis too like subjection, To pay, for mirth, both money, and reflection. Wise poets are content with present laughter, And leave the reason for't—to rise hereafter. Our author's muse, importing wit, to charm ye, Would, with a Frenchman's boasted wildfire warm ye; Gives ye a Play, which, e'er it wander'd hither, Brought Paris seventy crowded nights, together. What it may do, in London—you'll inform us: French batt'ries guard in vain—if Britons storm us. 'Tis no gay Opera—but there's much, that's smart in't, 'The God of wit vouchsafes to act a part in't. I play the ass, in't—that, you'll say's no wonder, 'Tis a disguise, most men are actors under. I grant it—asses in men's shape, are common; But reasoning asses have been heard by no man. Yet, since he needs must change me—would he had run it Up to the fashion's height, not underdone it! Had my long ears, and hoofs 'scap'd transformation, And one gay dance been learnt—I'd charm'd the nation. These empty Frenchmen of their wit may vapour, But, what's a nimble tongue, without a caper! That's one defect—another ten times greater, Is, that his Ladies taste is out of nature; She doats on ruin'd merit,—loving honey! And weds her Timon, 'cause he 'd lost his money: Did men want wives, and for that cause would take 'em, What choice of blessings kind Quadrille would make 'em! The rest I'll not anticipate—sit quiet, And, if your taste delights in change of diet, You'll meet it, in the plenteous feast, you came for, Dress'd in a foreign form, we have no name for. Prologue, to The Cure for Jealousy; spoken by a Woman, in Man's Cloaths. To cure man's jealously, that spleen, too common, Our author chose me, a firm friend to Woman! A willing doctor—But the downright fact is, In this new way, I'm but ill turn'd for practice. Yet, hang it—in an age unform'd for daring, What is there in the breeches, but the wearing! My outside's man, and I've seen many a true one Look—full as little likely—to undo one! Mark, Ladies! and from this night's scene discover, What art's I'll teach ye all, to hunt a lover; Wind him, thro' fear to hope, thro' rage to smiling, Till he distrusts his truth, by my beguiling: Cruel, with kind intent, I'll first inflame him; Then, when he's quite horn-mad, look kind, and tame him. Gall him with pain, to make him worthy pleasure, And teach him, by his Trips, my Truth measure. This done—I'll wed—for, then should love's ambition Start some dim cause, that might deserve suspicion, Sense of past blunders strikes his recollection, And fear, of new ones, shames him from inspection. Oh! 'tis a glorious thing, when poets write Thus, usefully—that we can profit by't! They talk of lessons, drawn from tragic scenes, Where tyrant lovers stab suspected queens; Where one imperious ranting, fierce, Othello Roars Lordship, into every tiny fellow. But, give me Comedy, the world's true picture; There, when the jealous doubter thinks, he's nick'd her, Up starts the sex's wit, to aid our nature, And then, poor spouse, himself, is prov'd the traitor. Ah Ladies!—If you dread the side-long eye, The low-brow'd squint, of joyless jealousy; If, in the pangs of innocence, oppress'd, You e'er have sigh'd, untrusted and unbless'd: Smile on this friendly hand, that serves your cause. And crown his favour'd scenes, with just applause. Epilogue, to the same Play. If only novelty can give delight, I fear, we've lost that favourite plea to night: What meant the Poet, when he hop'd success, From making man and master change their dress? 'Tis now so long, since this was thought a wonder, That none but men of taste know 'em asunder. Fam'd, for associate airs, the rivals quarrel, Which shall trip tightest in its next apparel. Improving, each by each, so fast, that neither Excells—but all are charm'd, alike, with either. Well! 'tis an humble age, when pride and greatness, Give up ambition, for long sticks and straitness: When conscious, none were gentry by creation, Peers drive out pomp, and level all the nation; And crop-ear'd knights instruct the herald prater, Tom and Sir Thomas, are the same, by nature. Joy to the pulpits—now, there needs no railing, At vanities, o'er head or foot, prevailing: Declaiming saints would all their satire lose, Who once preach'd laces, from the lady's shoes. 'Twould make the holiest, of those good men, stare, To see my Lady buckled, like her mare, And, free from mincing modesty, walk strong, Jut frank, and elbow nervously along. As to the Play I'd praise it, if I could; But e'en the title proves, it can't be good: A Cure for Jealousy!—'tis useless quite, 'Till charms grow strong, our passion to excite: But guardian fashion, now, so models dress; It cools desire and keeps down love's excess. Prologue, spoke by Mr. Johnson. As painters mingle shade to set off light, So contraries are mix'd, when poets write: All shadow would be darkness—Too much blaze Would dazzle—each, by each, new force displays. Form'd, on this principle, to night, we show, An unbred brute, against a wrong-bred beau: Our sprightly fop, to froth and France inclin'd, Fills his gay vacuum, with Parisian wind. Heavy by nature, volatile by art, Be-dull'd to briskness, and mis-call'd a smart. Oppos'd to this extreme, our home-grown shoot, Whose sense wants breeding, thinks himself to brute: Wise without pity—without temper plain, His friendship festers—and his love gives pain. His rough sincerity, ill-dress'd, uncouth, Offends by coarseness, whom it charms by truth: All virtues, if unprun'd, some folly blights; The rugged kindness, wanting sweetness, frights: And pert good-nature, coxcomb'd o'er, with flame, Provokes, like insolence, and stings, like shame. Betwixt these two, our author had design'd A third, fix'd, stedfast, English medium mind: Fram'd, like his country, with just hand to sway Th'unresting balance—byass'd neither way: But here deficient—he submits his cause, An humble stranger to the worth, he draws: Had some of your accomplish'd minds supplied His failing skill—he had not err'd, so wide, Judge but his aim—and, if his random throw Falls short, condemn not the unreaching blow. Should his imperfect scheme your spleen provoke; Be kind, or all his balance will be broke. PROLOGUE. Spoke by a young Gentleman, who play'd the Part of Castalio in the Orphan, for the Benefit of his Friend, who play'd Polydore. In, for one night, receive a volunteer, At a friend's call—Who would not, arm'd, appear? Danger looks lovely, where the Cause invites, And the near prospect rather charms; than frights. Yet, since the task is arduous, and requires A sea of passions, and a storm of fires; For strength, a borrower to your stores I come, And every bounteous hand shall lend me some: Teach me, ye Fair, how love and pity charm; Your eyes can light me, and your influence warm: Triumphs, and joys, your smiles can best supply; But from your lovers, I must learn, to die. Next—with your spirit, Sirs, my breast inspire, Lend me your eloquence, your air, your fire. Teach me your Softness, when in love I sue, And, to encrease it, if I conquer, too. But your inconstancy and lightness—those Keep to yourselves, I want 'em not—Heaven knows! Thus far, self-mov'd, and heedless of my trust, I, guardian like, serv'd my own interest, first; Now, I your smiles for Polydore exact, Should I not speak for him, for whom I act? Foes to all craft in love, your spleen express, And nobly hate him, for his dark success: To-night, forgive him—he but acts a part, Far from his wish, and foreign to his heart: He wears the blush of virtue on his face, And rather would be wretched, than be base. If, in the stage's gathering night, we stray, And (all its guides, now lost,) mistake our way; Be this my Polydore's, and my defence; Indulge us—'tis our first, and last offence. EPILOGUE, To the same: spoke by Monimia. I was just plotting, as the curtain fell, To hit the general taste, and please ye well: 'Twere a sure way, thought I, their frowns to soften, Should I, oft kill'd, and brought to life, as often, Now, in good earnest, draw oblivion o'er me, And die—as Tragedy has done, before me. Troth! it were no untimely resolution, Had one a heart dispos'd for—execution: Since there's a mode in minds, as well as dress, 'Tis too old fashion'd now to give distress. When you're resolv'd to laugh, and to be easy, Why should unsummon'd sense break in, to teize ye? Once, we had tuneless times—so out of measure, That wit was business, here—and thought was pleasure. Naked of song, dance, farce,—or Harlequining! A plain, dry Play, then charm'd, good heaven!—by meaning, Well! since it comes affirm'd—we must receive it; But, 'twas so long ago, I scarce believe it. This age, thank heaven, is wiser—Pit and Gallery, Treat their good, grave, forefathers taste, with raillery, What! sit three hours, to hear dull Actors prating, No Entertainment, after all that waiting— I'd give a dozen such Plays—for one Bear-baiting? Your humble actors, slowly stretch ambition, To top these arts of Play-house erudition: How e'er unapt by time, and you conducted, We too, shall mend, grow wise, and be instructed: Would I were six yards taller tho'—to charm ye! Or petite Mademoiselle en chienne t' alarm ye. Something, I soon, must learn above plain speaking— Teach me, some pig of taste, thy art of squeaking! No Patentee, now, holds us worth contracting, 'Till we have learnt more ways than one, of acting. What thinking face will any praise ordain us, Whose climbing eyes have scal'd—Mynheer Cajanus! Give place Great Alexander!—Go, retire— We have enroll'd a Hero—Three foot higher! From Cæsar's death, no future grief shall flow, Since every joyful night restores Pierro! While poor Monimia's and Castalio's die, Aye, let 'em go—the improv'd spectators cry; Mind what a cunning fellow—Harlequin is! And what a charming plot in every scene is: Well! in our turns, we yet may entertain ye; We shall be soon struck dumb—and, then we gain ye. PROLOGUE. When love's taught dangers animate the stage, Let the soft scenes your hearts, ye fair! engage: Let each bright list'ner mark the wiles, we show, And catch dumb caution, from the pictur'd woe, Guiltless of farce, to night, the meaning player Courts not your laughter, but alarms your care. Man, the deceiver, veils his cruel art, And skreens himself within th' attempted heart; There, to ungen'rous empire, climbs, e'er long, Help'd by the confidence he means to wrong: This to detect, we act his falshood o'er, And the deluder known, betrays no more. SUCH the best business of the comic muse: Love has a thousand lessons to infuse, Not always lightness should ungrace the scene; To laugh at folly, but indulges spleen: Coxcombs and Fops, in harmless error, stray, And trip, undangerous, out of passion's way: Misers and Sots, less mirth than pity move, And dulness brings an antidote, for love. But there's a Traitor, arm'd in amorous mail, Born to attempt, and fashion'd to prevail: Disguis'd in softness, by deep arts endear'd, And always dangerous, because never fear'd; Him in our glass of life, to night we show, Nor stoop the condescending scene, too low. Hence, if too grave, for Comedy, we seem, Think us but suited to our serious theme; 'Tis no light loss, when charming woman falls, On our defence the sex's merit calls; We, who the picture's of a world impart, Neglect not, what concerns its fairest part; All danger to that sex, thus frankly shown, At the same time, does honour to our own. Nor let neglect of laughter move the pit, To dread, in consequence, a dearth of wit: Unmeaning mirth may live, in empty noise, But solid converse swells our softer joys. Once, in an age of tumbling, dance, and song, Suppose not two short hours of sense, too long: Not e'en the fashion, change of taste denies; Oft merry here, let us be, sometimes, wise. EPILOGUE, To the same. Baulk'd, as I am, my heart's best hope miscarry'd, Try'd, cast, and sentenc'd, to be hang'd—that's marry'd! E'er I'm turn'd off—I think it but my duty, To warn, in my last speech, fast-falling beauty. First, Maidens,—Let my sad example teach ye, To put no trust in Man, till he can't reach ye; For, if you strive, too near, his strength's so mighty, That down you come at once—and then, good night t'ye: Next, O ye Wives, trust not in beauty's merit, But, to your body's influence, add your spirit: With your eye's light'ning, mix a tongue, that thunders; Believe me, love, so double-arm'd, works wonders. Yet, if nor charms, nor eloquence can save ye, But your good man will break the faith, he gave ye, Be you before hand with him—that reproving Will make him owne—there's guilt in too light loving. As for you, Widows,—you're too wise, for teaching, But suff'ring malefactors must be preaching: So, take one word of counsel in your calling, Though you're too brave, I know, to fear a falling, From your old yoke set free—admit no new one, Unless, with some, poor, brisk, young, kind, and true one: The conscious youth, long mindful of your favour, Will make up all defects—with good behaviour: Loth, that his wants, his gratitude shou'd smother, What he can't give you one way, he'll give another. And now, good people, what I've more to say t'ye, Should be a doleful tune, and sigh, and pray t'ye: But—doleful tunes of late, are grown so common, They move more sorrow, than a dying woman: And sighs, and pray'rs, are best, when made in private, As you all know—who have good ends, to drive at. What shall I do then?—shall I hang and tarry, Or bold, in saving faith, go on—and marry. 'Tis both ways, bad—But I've at once bethought me, Of a sweet lesson, dear revenge, has taught me: I'll stay, and see Sir Harry in his fetters, Nor be so rude to swing, before my betters: Pass but his honey-moon of sunshine weather, And he, and I, may then, go hang together. PROLOGUE, For Mr. Johnson, in the Character of Cato. E'er I presume, to try to night's fam'd part, Kind to the modest, chear a doubtful heart: No vain conceits too rash a speed create; I bend, all conscious of a Cato's weight; Calmly content, by measur'd steps, to rise, I view the distant goal, with patient eyes: Fond of the stage, where life's strong passions glow, But shun the choaky weeds, that o'er it grow. Unpush'd by pride, climb slow care's due degrees, Humbly aspiring—and—but long—to please. Well can my mem'ry—to my blush—restore Whose steps I tread in—who was here—before. Him have you seen—A Cato, worth your praise! Fill'd with Rome's fire, and form'd, to grace her Bays! Ill, to supply such absent splendor, sent— Receive me—in the light—His lustre lent. Judge me not vain, while lengths, unwish'd, I run; See, the faint shadow—and suppose—the Sun. Such, I would be—such—if time's future day Frowns not, on hopes too bold—perhaps—I may: Try, with kind confidence, what praise can do: Think it, but, possible—and make it—true; Stoop, when I fall—support me, where I stand; Weakness grows strength—in Pity's guardian hand. NOT at one step, far distant heights we climb: Merit and favour—are the gifts—of Time. Gradual in growth, and kindling at your flame, So, might you teach my taste to meet your aim: Rais'd by your smiles, to touch the point in view, You make your Cato—and he dies—for you. PROLOGUE, To the Fatal Extravagance: spoke by Mr. Ryan. Warm'd by a kindred sense of England's woes, A Caledonian muse, with pity glows: From ruin'd hopes a saving moral takes, And paints th' unhappy, for the happy's sake: Scotland's new taste our meaning scene supplies, And a first flight, on tragic pinions, tries, Brave and long-fam'd in arms, her warlike race Have trod the fields of death with dauntless grace! Fierce and untir'd in blood, have nobly dar'd, And every toil and every danger shar'd: Now, fir'd by rising arts, she grasps the Bays, And her old cant, like falling stocks, decays: Her long-lost muse new-lights her antient flame, And our scene blazes with recover'd fame. We teach to-night—ah! would 'twere not too late, How rash-believing avarice galls a state! What private sorrows, from wild hazards flow! And, how false hope produces certain woe. THIS, the most natural business of the stage, Will all your generous hearts, 'tis hop'd, engage: None can their pity for those woes conceal, Which most, who hear, perhaps, too deeply, feel. The rants of ruin'd kings, of mighty name, For pompous misery—small compassion claim: Empires o'erturn'd, and heroes, held in chains, Alarm the mind, but give the heart no pains. To ills remote from our domestic fears, We lend our wonder, but with-hold our tears. Not so, when, from such passion, as our own, Some favourite folly's dreadful fate is shown; There the soul bleeds for what it feels, within, And conscious pity shakes, at suffering sin. O! give attention to the moving scene: And shun, what yet may be, by what has been. EPILOGUE, To the same, spoke by Mrs Seymour. You've seen the Play—and I'll unfold the Poet, To whom (stray'd sheep of a pure flock) we owe it, He's a chance blessing—somewhat strangely flung us! Dropt, from the clouds of innocence, among us! Slipt through the Kirks loose pale, we gave him quarter; Poor soul! he had like to've been the muse's Martyr: When stage-plays! and abominations! took him, Grace, and the shepherds of the Saints forsook him. 'Twas given thenceforth, to Satan's power, to win him; —The root of the sound matter was not in him. Yet, tho' rebuk'd, full sore—he's no huge sinner.— You'll scarce see one of his pure brethren, thinner. Most sanctified of face! troth—I'm afraid, If his looks lie not—the poor man's a maid! The Bard, not carnal-minded, (say the curious, How come th'unfleshly folks, to be so furious? Judge you the quarrel, right—we'll briefly show it: —Good Plays give good instruction, said the Poet: Vanity! cry'd the brethren—gross defilement! And, so, the war broke out, past reconcilement. Young Bays, provok'd, here drew his wrathful pen; Shine forth, said he, my muse, on these dark men: And prove, by dint of fair example, whether Much goodness is not learnt, by coming hither. But what he teaches, be to him alone: I'll teach a secret lesson, of my own. SAY they, of Plays, that men learn nothing by 'em? I stand the stage's champion, and defy 'em: Who that has seen, to night, how I, a wife, Gave counsel, fit to've sav'd my spouse's life, Learns not this moral, past all contradiction, That disobedient husbands—meet affliction? That he's most happy, who his fetters eases, And lets his wiser wife—do—what she pleases. This, for our sex's fame, his Play produces, You see, all doctrines have their hidden uses: To this—if the bluff brethren preach resistance, Let 'em, as they love safety, keep their distance; For, should we catch 'em, in our wrong'd dominion, Stiff, as they are, we'll make 'em change opinion. Writ on a Window, in the Highlands of Scotland. Scotland! thy weather's like a modish wife! Thy winds and rains, forever, are at strife: So, termagant, a while, her Thunder tries, And, when she can no longer scold—she cries. ORRA MOOR. A SONG, alter'd. I Stay, stay, O Sun! whose chearful Ray Has drawn my Orra's feet astray: O! chase the Fogs—O! clear the Skies! And guide my Orra, to my eyes. II O! were I sure my Dear to view, I'd climb the top of that tall Yew! Aloft, in air, I'd quivering stand, And round, and round, explore the land. III Where, Orra Moor! where art thou stray'd? What wood conceals my sleeping maid? Torn by the thorns, enrag'd I'll tear The trees, that hide my silent fair. IV Oh! I could ride those clouded skies, Or, on that Raven's pinions rise! Ye Storks! ye Swans!—a moment, stay, And waft a Lover, on his way. V Far! far! from me, my Orra flies, While, here, forsaken Summer dies: Come, Winter, come! no frost I fear; Her icey heart has bound me, here. VI No, no—I'll burst each wint'ry bar, Thy chain, O love! is strongest far! By steel may bodies be confin'd, But love, my Orra, chains the mind. VII Cease, cease thy pain, O throbbing breast! When thoughts are woes—the first are best: 'Tis Death to go—'Tis worse—to stay: I'll die with Orra—haste away. Verses made for Mr. S?v?ge; and sent to my Lady M?ls?d, his Mother. Hopeless, abandon'd, aimless, and oppress'd, Lost, to delight, and, every way, distress'd: Cross his cold bed, in wild disorder, thrown, Thus sigh'd, Alexis, friendless, and alone. Why do I breath? what joy can Being give, When she, who gave me life, forgets I live! Feels not these wintry blasts—nor heeds my smart: But shuts me, from the shelter of her heart? Saw me expos'd, to want! to shame! to scorn! To ills!—which make it misery to be born! Cast me, regardless, on the world's bleak wild: And bad me be a wretch, while yet a child! WHERE can he hope for pity, peace or rest, Who moves no softness—in a mother's breast? Custom, law, reason, all! my cause forsake: And nature sleeps to keep my woes awake! Crimes, which the cruel, scarce believe can be, The kind are guilty of, to ruin me! Even she, who bore me, blasts me with her hate, And, meant my fortune, makes herself my fate? Yet, has this sweet neglecter of my woes The softest, tend'rest breast, that pity knows! Her eyes shed mercy, wheresoe'er they shine, And her soul melts, at every woe—but mine. Sure, then! some secret fate, for guilt unwill'd, Some sentence pre-ordain'd to be fulfill'd! Plung'd me, thus deep, in sorrow's searching flood, And wash'd me, from the mem'ry of her blood. But, oh! whatever cause has mov'd her hate, Let me but sigh, in silence, at my fate; The God, within, perhaps, may touch her breast, And, when she pities—who can be distress'd? On Lady Mary Wortley Montagu's bringing with her out of Turkey, the Art of Inoculating the Small-Pox. When Greece, reviving, into short delight, Felt pride, and comfort, at our muse's sight, The rival'd nine no sooner saw her face, But e'en their envy gave their wonder place! Charm'd, into love, of what eclips'd their fame, They wak'd Apollo, with her powerful name. See!—God of Grecian wit! Urania cries, How sweet a Muse the Western World supplies! Say, should she ask some favour from your throne, What could you bid her take, that's not her own? Sparkling in charms, the heavenly stranger view, So grac'd!—she scarce can owe a beam to you! Beauty, with love, her power to your's prefers: And wit, and learning, are, already, hers! Rous'd, at her name—receding, from her eyes, The gazing God rose slow, in soft surprize! Fair miracle, he said,—and paus'd, a while: Then, thus—Sweet glory of your envy'd Isle! Charm'd, and oblig'd, lest we ungrateful seem, Bear, hence, at least, one mark of our esteem. One of my three great claims, your wish may fit; Whose voice is musick, and whose thoughts are wit! Physic, alone, remains, to grant you, here— A skill! your godlike pity will endear. Form'd, to give wounds, which must no ease procure, Atone your influ'nce, by new arts, to cure. Beauty's chief foe, a fear'd and fierce disease! Bows at my beck; and knows its God's decrees. Breath'd, in this kiss, take power, to tame its rage, And, from its rancour, free the rescued age: High o'er each sex, in double empire, sit: Protecting beauty, and inspiring wit. To Clelia, in the Country. On the pulling down St. Martin's Church. While, from the noisy croud, you lean, retir'd In silent shades, by love of thought inspir'd; I, vex'd by various cares, to business chain'd, Mourn'd your lost converse, and in town remain'd: Dark, as the midnight world, your sunshine gone, Guideless, in sullen gloom, I wander'd on: Passion's wild influence ebb'd, and flow'd, my mind, As seas drive diff'rent, with the changing wind: But to what point soe'er, my will was bound, In vain, I turn'd th'unresting compass round: Doubtful, a while, the wav'ring needle hung, Then, trembling, backward to your image sprung. Pensive, I view'd a sacred pile, of late, Which falls, like man, to rise, in nobler state, The Doors thrown wide, it seem'd unveil'd to lie, And reverend ruin struck my startled eye. Ent'ring, amidst the busy hammer's sound, I saw time's dusty trophies scatter'd round: Each violated pillar stood, bedew'd: And wept in solemn grief, a fate so rude. From tombs by force disjoin'd, reluctant stones Roll'd, mix'd with clouds of dust, and human bones: From faithless walls, defac'd inscriptions fled, And, to long night, consign'd the nameless dead: The pews pale squares, in their whole lengthen'd row, Gave way, and open'd a sad scene, below! Beauty, youth, wealth, and power, reduc'd to clay, Larded with bones, yet moist, unshelter'd lay: Remnants of eyeless Skulls, with hollow stare, Mock'd the proud looks, which living charmers wear: Coffins rose broke, unfaithful to their trust! And flesh flew round me, in unjointed dust. Scarce a short span, beneath that opening floor, Where kneeling charmers pray'd, the week before; Where forms, like yours! rejoic'd th' admiring eye, Forms, once, like yours! in naked atoms, lie. O! fate of failing life! O! flatt'ring dream! What wint'ry sunshine is thy shadowy gleam! Thus, while I mus'd, thy soul approach'd my ear; Thy soft-wing'd soul! that, always, hovers near. See'st thou, it sigh'd—How these sad relicks lie! And do'st thou fear, that Clelia, thus, can die? No—She's all mind; and her immortal name, Eluding death's short reach, shall tread on fame. Tongues, yet unthought off, Clelia shall adorn, And charm adoring nations—yet unborn. Heroes, at whose resolves, the world will shake, Shall treat thy sex with reverence, for thy sake; And each fair tyrant, who would Empress be, Form but one wish—to think, and look, like thee. To a Lady, who lov'd Angling, from a Hint, out of Dr. Donne. I Some, by the bending reed's slow aid, May boast th' unwary fish betray'd: Others may finny shoals beset, And sweep 'em, with the treach'rous net. II But, why shou'd Sylvia use deceit, Who is, herself, her own best bait? Step but, undress'd, within the brook, And smile at every needless hook. III Each willing fish will, round thee, swim, Gladder to catch thee, than thou him. Or, if one fish, uncaught, goes by That fish, is wiser, far, than I! To a Lady, who had a very fine Shape, and fine Complexion. Can forms, like yours, want Ornament of dress? Beauty, like truth, shines most in Nakedness. Dressing may skreen deformities from view, But, e'en, adornment does but shadow you! Most, but by what they wear, are lovely made, You, Madam, lose, whene'er you seek such aid. While others dress, their lover's hearts to warm, You put off nothing, but what veil'd a charm! Answer to the Resolve. Whilst empty coxcombs blast a woman's fame, In every state, and every age, the same: With their own folly pleas'd, each Fair they toast And, where they least are happy, swear they're most; No diff'rence marking, 'twixt the gay and lewd, But dreaming, all, who fly, would be pursued: While thus, they vainly think, and vainly live, Lost, to that reverence, love's soft lessons give; Let this great Maxim be my passion's guide; May I ne'er hope, where I am ne'er deny'd, Nor gain a Woman, willing to be try'd. Answer to a scurrilous, obscene Poem, entitled, An Epistle from Mrs Robinson to Senesino. From thy loose lines, I turn my eyes away, Nor know, o'erspread with blushes, what to say: The modest muses, wounded, by thy strain, For me, and for themselves, do thus complain. O thou! our country's folly and expence! Dull foe to Tragedy and God-like sense! Too long mean, mercenary shade, too long, Has't thou these Isles inchanted with thy song. Musick's soft God unbinds the charm, he rais'd, He blest thy tongue, and while he blest, we prais'd: By thee polluted, he disclaims his choice, And will no longer warble in thy voice. His trembling notes, where melting softness hung, And every grace, will seek a chaster tongue. No more, the lover shall thy song repeat, No more, the fair one sigh—'Tis wondrous sweet! Oh! guilty Senesino! thou, no more, Shalt bravo! bravo! hear—or loud encore. The loose and dull, shall all thy audience be; The chaste and witty shall resent for me. All unattended shall thy aukward form, To sad, uncrowded scenes, or whine, or storm. Thy wretched ha—shall unapplauded, grow, And ill-plac'd bays fall, with'ring from thy brow. Know, Songster, Julius, Godlike chief disdains Thy shrill, unnatural, ungraceful, strains: With rage redoubled, Pompey's ghost must burn, To find such tears profane his sacred urn. Remember, Echo, soon thou'lt know the time, Stript of thy robes, thy legions, and thy rhyme; Thou poor Machine, of mean delusive sound, When I shall see thy temples all unbound, And those who heroes act, like heroes, crown'd THOU to thy famish'd Italy shalt go, And rival Faustus, to the shades, below. The Choice, to a Friend. Oh, greatly bless'd! who can, as fate requires, By ductile wisdom, temper your desires! Balanc'd, within, you look abroad, serene, And, marking both extremes, pass, clear, between. Oh! could your lov'd example teach your skill! And, as it moves my wonder, mend my will! Calm would my passions grow: my lot might please; And my sick soul should think itself, to ease, But to the future, while I strain my eye, Each present good slips, undistinguish'd by. Still, what I would contends with what I can; And my wild wishes leap the bounds of Man. If in my power it lies, to limit hope, And my unchain'd desires can fix a scope: This were my choice—Oh, friend, pronounce me poor: For I have wants, which wealth can never cure! Mean is that soul, which its own good can fill; A prosp'rous world, alone, could feast my will. He's poor, at best, who others misery sees, And wants the wish'd-for power, to give it ease. He's rich, who sole-supreme, and unconfin'd, Can, with unbounded influence, bless mankind. A glory this! unreach'd—but on a throne! All were enough—but less, than all, is none. This my first wish—But, since 'twere wild and vain, To grasp at glitt'ring clouds with fruitless pain; More safely low, let my next prospect be: And life's mild evening this fair sun-set see. Far, from a Lord's loath'd neighbourhood—a state, Whose little greatness is a pride, I hate! On some lone wild, should my strong house be plac'd, Surrounded, by a vast, and healthy, waste: Sterile and coarse, the untry'd soil should be; But forc'd to flourish, and subdued by me. Seas, woods, meads, mountains, gardens, streams, and skies, Shou'd, with a changeful grandeur, charm my eyes, Still, where I mov'd, new marks of my past pains, Shou'd plume the mountain tops, and paint the plains: Greatly obscure, and shunning courts, or name, Widely befriended, but escaping fame. Peaceful, in studious quiet, would I live; Lie hid, for leisure; and grow rich, to Give. To the Editor of Clarissa. Painters to Poets, owe their noblest praise; Mute are their tints, 'till voic'd by living lays: Passive, the semblant forms but seem to breath; Delusive surface holds no depth beneath. Far other lines Clarissa's painter drew! Far other force his pensive colours knew! There, in round fulness, active pictures glow, Turgid with speaking life, and thinking woe. His, the soul's pencil, whose warm strokes impart Mind, to the form, and passion to the heart. A delegate Creator! calm, he lies, And sees the worlds, he calls for, round him, rise. Oh! might he live, 'till his Clarissa's death! But life immortal suits not mortal breath. Let him but live, 'till all, who read, are taught, What aided influence, beauty draws from thought! Then, would his length'ning years all bounds defy, And nature, and her friend, together, die. So, would he charm whole time—yet, vainly, too: Reach every conscious heart—to change—how few! Let him not hope too much—nor heaven, nor he, Sets human minds, from human frailties free: Tho' each can own, where all the rest are hit, And every flaw, remote from self, admit: Tho' marks, external catch the visual ray, All in-shut objects shun the search of day. Each ugliest likeness, for another, shown, Strikes all: but none find eyes, to note their own. Yet his—whate'er stage, press, or pulpit can! Whate'er the heart's touch'd feelings lend, to Man: All, that from all is learnt, one genius gives, And, in collective right of virtue, lives. WHENCE was his more than magic power supply'd, So skill'd, to start life's game, on every side! Where could his line th'unmeasur'd vastness find, To fathom all the depths, of all mankind! Piercing, as light, from heaven, to earth, he flows, And every stain, and every beauty, shows! The three great powers, that shake the human heart, Are musick, eloquence, and paintive art: Picture and eloquence, already, charm, In every tearful page, divinely warm! Oh! let tun'd numbers fill th' illustrious trine: In some new work, let added musick shine, Let his next wreath, the Poet's Ivy claim: And his own verse immortalize his name. Verse, so inspir'd, inspiring, and combin'd, Would pour th' enrapt'ring virtues, o'er the mind; Rouse, from their roots in earth, hearts, hard as steel, And teach, once more, the trees, and beasts, to feel! Honest Tom Tar's Prayer. Honest Tom Tar, of unpacific fist, Plunder'd by Dons, he must not dare resist; Longing, unlicens'd, to revenge his smart, Curs'd 'em in valiant bitterness of heart. GOD grant us grace, he cry'd, old debts to pay, And give these rogues their own another day! God teach Jack Spaniard cowardice and flight, And teach Old England, in exchange, to fight. Kind Heaven, with pity, heard the brave bold fellow, Gave his curse force—and Spain his Farinello. Miss A?n?l's Circle. I In all the state of sovereign love, See, see the worshipp'd Goddess shine! While crowding suppliants round her move, And every hope, too hard, for mine. II Easy and sprightly, near her, see The Son of titled L?n?le plead! Without a sigh, he smiles his plea, And brings a heart, too gay, to bleed. III Mark, next, a youth, more close, than he! 'Tis C?r?l, in his dawn of day: Softly bold, and humbly free, His French adroitness paves the way. IV S?l?n no dangerous rival seems, While he, forsaking love for wit, All unadoring, just, esteems, Crows, claps his wings, and leaves the Pit. V In earnest struck, and sick, within, Young C?n with woes, would move; Tells real pains, and thinks, to win A Woman's heart by infelt love. VI P?h's noble Duke, with shape, and air, Adorning dignity with grace, From every look assaults the fair, And carries courtship, in his face. VII In rear of these, and yet to come, Her namesake, next, his fate to prove, Stops short, and turns, in sight of Rome, And quits the Saints, to bow to love. VIII What has poor J?rn?n to hope, Dim-shining, in so bright a crowd? Shall he, despairing, court a rope, Or hopeless flame be still avowd? IX Hang mean distrust—The Charmer knows, What rapture dwells, in life and fire! And never beauty wrongly chose, That crown'd warm truth and met desire. To the two generous Masters St. Quintin, on their tender Affection to each other, in their Progress through, and Recovery from, the Small-Pox. Sexes are needless aids, in love's pure claim, Since souls (not bodies) light our social flame. Lamps, of imprison'd life, misplac'd, we shine, Leap, lean our lengthening points—and long to join! So, long'd your brother minds, to mix embrace; As light meets light, and space is lost, in space. DEATH, with suspended hand, beheld your strife, Call'd off disease's rage, and set free life. Why should they die, the ghastly Pauser cry'd Whom names but separate, and but forms divide? See, with what spring th' elastic strugglers flew! Clung to their fate, and to death's horrors grew! In vain eruptive fires their faces skreen: Fever's hot anguish, vainly, burnt, between. Wolves, that behind some thicket, scent their prey, Not with more fierce delight, o'er thorns make way, Than, lur'd by danger, one, with rapture sought Th' infectious grasp, that his best half had caught: There smil'd, their twisted souls, farewel, all fear; We rise, together, to a Heaven, not here. No—let 'em stay, to earth's dim dust confin'd, Cross'd, in their clouded way, t'ward realms of mind. 'Twas not Death's drift to strike for—added bliss, In next world, Angels—You're but Men in this. Sent to a Lady with a Pocket-Looking-Glass. See! my soul's serene invader! See the face, I first, ador'd! Heaven, for love, and pity, made her, And with angel's graces, stor'd. Mark her forehead's aweful rising, See her soul-subduing eyes! Every look, and air, surprizing! Modest, lively, soft, and wise. Next to you, I own, I love her; But your sweet, discerning, eye, Must not, now, be jealous of her: She's ne'er seen, but you are by. To David Mallet Esq; on a mistaken Supposition, that I had forgot him. Wit, like yours—and yet forgot? Dreamy doubt? believe it not. Faith, in silence, loves to dwell, Fill'd with sense, it shuns to tell. Shoaly waters loudest dash; Distant light'nings longest flash: Spare pretence's empty drum, Deepest joys are, oft'nest, dumb: Bodies part—but mutual mind Stretch'd immense, continuous join'd, Ever tangent, always seen, Souls embrace, with world's between. Pride, indeed, avows it fit, Men, forgotten, should forget: Reason more to justice owes; Reason loves—because it knows. Debt can ne'er for traffick stay; Unreceiving, it, must pay: Taste of other's worth—shou'd none Lend a weight, to aid our own— Don't, howe'er, the balance fail, Toss in self to turn the scale. PROLOGUE: To Eurydice. In youth, when modesty and merit meet, How rare the union, and the force, how sweet! Tho' at small praise, our humble author aims, His friend may give him, what his blush disclaims. Ladies!—to you, he makes his chief address, Form'd, to be pray'd to, and e'en born, to bless! He feels your pow'r, himself, and makes it felt, His scenes will teach, each stubborn heart, to melt: And each fair eye, that, now, shines softly, here, Anon, shall shine, still softer, thro' a tear: Let not constraint your generous sighs repress, Nor veil compassion—nor repel distress: Your sex's strength is—in such weakness found, And sighs, and tears, but help your charms—to wound. Of all the wonders, taught us, by the fair, 'Tis strangest—Tragedy should lose their care! Where love, soft tyrant! in full glory, reigns, And sovereign beauty holds the world in chains. Less polish'd, and more bold, the comic muse Unkings your Cupid, or obstructs his views: Upholds presuming wit's familiar claim, And blots out awe, from love's diminish'd flame; Find, or makes, faults; and sets 'em strong in sight, And dares draw woman—false, or vain, or light. While Tragedy—your servant, try'd, and true, Still to your fame, devoted, and to you, Enslav'd to love, subdu'd ambition brings; Firms beauty's power, and crowns it King of Kings. Let wish'd attention grace our scene to night, And mourn'd afflictions move refin'd delight: Each tender light of life we recommend: Wife, husband, subject, parent, son, and friend, All your impassion'd interests shall engage, And hopes, and fears, and pity, fire the stage. Then, when soft sorrow swells the fair one's breast, And sad impressions mix, with nightly rest; Pleasing remembrance shall our scene supply, And the sweet sadd'ning influence never die. The Actor's Epitome. If comprehension, best, can pow'r express, And that's, still, greatest, which contains the less; No rank's high claim can make the player's small, Since acting each, he comprehends them, all. OFF, to due distance, half the stalking train! Blots of a title, your low tastes profane! No dull cold mouther shares the actor's plea, Rightly to seem is transiently, to be. Arduous the task, and asks a cimbing brain; A head for judgment, and a heart for pain: E'er sense, impress'd, reflects adopted forms, And changeful nature shakes, with borrow'd storms. TEN strong-mark'd passions signs external bear, And stamp assum'd distinctions on the player; Joy, grief, fear, anger, pity, scorn, and hate, Wonder, shame, jealousy, and love's soft weight. These, when he paints, did he but first conceive Each, on his fancy, would its image leave; Thence, ductile fibres catch the expressive spring, And the eyes dart it, and the accents ring. You, who would Joy's triumphant pride express, What most you wish, imagine you possess. Strait, flames th' idea to the kindling eye, And every nerve, in concord, braces high: Treading on air, each joint a soul displays; The looks, all, lighten—and the limbs, all, blaze. But you, who act unhoping grief's distress, Touch fancy, with some home-felt wretchedness. Then, slack'ning nerves the loose impression take; Each sad look sickens: the shock'd spirits break: Dim falls the faded eye;—the steps drag, slow, And ev'ry heedless gesture heaves, with woe. FEAR is but active grief, avoiding pain, Yet flies, too faintly, and avoids, in vain: While stagnate spirits, thick'ning, as they spread, O'er the cold heart, crawls slow, the living lead. What, tho' the eye's prompt ray keen light'ning dart! 'Tis fruitless:—loos'ning fibres lame the heart. ANGER is pride provok'd, beyond controul, When some felt insult fires the smarting soul: Then, the will's warmth, repelling fancy'd shame, Strings the nerves hard, and bids the eye-balls flame: Then marks of menace, air, and face deform; And short, thick, breathings, paint the infelt storm. PITY is active sense of alien grief; Think, some dear, dying suff'rer begs relief: Aidful idea springs, to succour woe, And ev'ry quivering sinew learns to glow, While, mild, as sighing saints, the sadd'ning face, Clouds, into anguish, with relenting grace. SCORN is cold anger, careless and at ease, Calm sense of wrongs, too harmless, to displease; Bold, in undoubted safety, 'twould disclaim Defiance—and with proud remissness, flame. Now smiles, now frowns;—yet both with eye, serene; And lets the nerves play loose, with painless spleen. HATRED is sullen fury, long retain'd: 'Tis willing mischief, warily restrain'd: This to paint strong, the back-brac'd nerves should toil, In fetter'd strain; and heave in curv'd recoil: While, with impatient frown, th'averted eye Shuns the loath'd object, it disdains, too nigh. Pain-seeking Jealousy feels doubtful rage, Which trustful pity struggles to asswage: Thence, frets uncertain pain, with pensive glow, And look, and action, share divided woe. Sad, in the face, the heart's felt softness reigns, While each tugg'd sinew angry vengeance strains. WONDER is curious fear—Suppose, by night, Some pale, met spectre cross'd the moon's dim light! Sudden, the back'ning blood, retreating swift, Swells the press'd heart:—Each fibre fails, to lift; Lost, in short pause, arrested motion lies, And sense climbs doubtful, to the straining eyes. LOVE is, at once, intense and slack desire: There, hope inflames, while reverence cools the fire. Fear of repulse, bold sense of joy withdraws; Sighs in each accent; every movement awes: Soft, earnest looks blush o'er th' inclining face, And sinewy transport borrows shade, from grace. EPILOGUE, To the Lover The scene now clos'd, and Eustace eas'd, at heart, Pardon six lines, in pity of poor Smart: One play will bear two morals; and I'll show, There's something for our sex, e'en in a beau. I have, a spark, of captain Smart's fine airs; His front white-border'd, with a fringe of hairs, His new-print Hat, like Elziver in small Tips a huge round O face, in Capital! Short, and hid, harmless, hangs his sword declin'd, While a long tail, misplac'd, struts out, behind. Strange contradictions his mixt dress implies: A short, Dutch waiste, with skirts of blue-coat size, Two harness-buckles his poor shoes must wear, Yet be allow'd no heels, their weight to bear! Narrow his ruffles—but in broad amends, Up, to his shoulders, the flap'd sleeve extends! And yet, while this pert dress, thus, two fold ran, His short red waistcoat—look'd but half a man. In my averted eyes, he read my thought, And vow'd to charm me, the first glance he caught. Then stoop'd—hung wriggling back—wav'd, smil'd, and scrap'd, And clos'd his hands—and cock'd his chin and gap'd. Madam, said he, 'twill poze your wit to guess The mysteries of this emblematic dress; These Hats we wear, to prove us free from pride; Light, humble measurers of the brains, they hide. This round head-crop, a mystic sign appears, In due detection of our meaning ears. Our sword's old needless length away we threw, As sworn, to shun all battles, but with you. Inside and out, each mark your claim insures, And every inch of every Smart is yours. He bow'd and sneer'd;—and I a convert grew, Nor 'till that moment, half his merits knew. Let wives, who wish subjection, marry wits; Women love power—A fool our fancy hits: We can be heads ourselves—and want of brain, Let him have no worse want, ne'er gives us pain. PROLOGUE. Spoke by Mr. Johnson. Tonight, no languid love shall dare complain: Woe, far more serious, asks more serious pain; Critic, be ours; 'tis now, the patriot's cause; What Briton wars, on liberty—and laws! Sweet liberty! thou sunshine of the heart! Thou smile of nature! and thou soul of art! Without thy aid, no human hope could grow: And love, and wealth, and wisdom, were but woe! Thine, in all ages, all the wise and brave: No hero ever was—or wish'd a slave. BRITAIN, fair Queen of states! feel if thou can'st, Feel thy own happiness—'Tis all thou want'st: Blest Isle! while every groaning nation, round, Bows, to the servile yoke, ignobly bound, Thou, from their confines, and their miseries, rent, Safe, sea-set gem!—thy own, great continent! Shew'st a tame, truckling world, one generous land, Where power ne'er prosper'd, in a tyrant's hand! Live, ye brave guardians of your country's cause! Live, and give freedom life, by living laws. From your white cliffs, look round a world enslav'd; And hug th' asserted rights, your fathers sav'd. But, while slow-rous'd, your dreaded arms prevail, And commerce, spite of envy, spreads her sail, Stoop not to forfeit Wits all-bright'ning claim: Sword, Trade, and pen, should guard the conqu'ror's fame. Taste, for yourselves—be all French power disdain'd: Not e'en a slave wou'd bear his fancy chain'd. Off with their fripp'ry modes—their Kings, in vain, Attempt us—shall their cooks, and taylors reign? Cross 'em, in taste, dress, politicks,—and dance; Scorn, e'en, a Step, that leaves the lead, to France; Smile at the pride, their light stage-cap'rer feels, Firm-standing Britons need no flying heels. Rise, rise, lost muse! re-wake the slumb'ring scene, Teach show, to animate—and sound, to mean. Solemn, and high, new-string the tragic lyre; Tempt back the Poet's God, to lend his fire. Here, must he dwell; his face no slave dares see, And who, not British-born, is, now, left free? Hither, from Rome, Rome's antient genius flies: For fancy cannot live, where courage dies, Hail, my last hope, she crys—inspir'd by me, Wish, think, talk, write, and act—for liberty. Yet—would you build my fabrick, to endure, Be your hearts warm, but let your hands be pure. Never, to shine, yourselves, your country sell: Displac'd, think nobly: when in power, act well. Agree, like modern, fight, like antient, Rome: War but abroad—and taste sweet peace, at home. Let no self-server, general trust betray; No pique, no party bar the public way: Front an arm'd world, with union on your side, No foe shall shake you—if no friends divide. The Lord's Prayer in Verse. Almighty father! of high Heaven possess'd! Be thy name holy, and thy power confess'd! Teach us, on earth to know, and do thy will; As Heaven's bright train thy great commands fulfill. Gracious, our daily bread of life, bestow: And show us mercy, as we mercy show: Guard us, from strong temptation's powerful call; Nor, when we meet with evil, let us fall. An Address, from the Statues at Stowe, to Lord Cobham, on his Return to his Garden. From every muse, and every art, thy own, Thy bowers, our Theatres, thy mind, our throne; Hail to thy virtues, manumiz'd from state, Hail to thy leisure to be wisely great! Fetter'd by duties, and to forms enslav'd, How timely has thy life a remnant sav'd! To taste that freedom, which thy sword maintain'd, And lead, in letter'd ease, a life unpain'd! So Scipio, Carthage fall'n, resign'd his plume, And smil'd, at the forgetfulness of Rome. O, greatly bless'd! whose evening sweetliest shines, And in unclouded slowness, calm, declines! Now, free reflection, with reverted eye, Wan'd from hot noontide, and a troubled sky, Divides life well—the largest part long known Thy country's claim—the last, and best, thy own. Go, like the masters of the world, go shine; Be Charles' life, and Dioclesian's thine: Form thy own power; dependent peace create, And shade distinction from the storms of state: With pray'rs, and praise, thy toil, (like heaven's) be paid, And guard the growing world, thy hands have made. There, while detach'd, thy self-supported soul Resumes dominion, and escapes controul; Moves, with a grandeur, monarchs seek, in vain, Above all forms, all dangers, and all pain: The muse shall find thee, in thy bless'd retreat, And breathe this honest wish at Cobham's feet: Fresh, as thy lakes, may all thy pleasures flow; And breezy, like thy groves, thy passions blow Wide as thy fancy, be thy spreading praise, And long, and lovely, as thy walks—thy days. What is God? Hold!—'Tis too much for thought! decide no more: But, in safe silence, awefully adore. Lost, in th' immense abyss, man can but see, That he, who knows God, right, must, first, be he. Writ on a Blank Leaf of Alzira, when given to His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales. Go, Muse! nor vainly mourn Britannia stray'd, In faction, roughning, or dissolv'd, in trade; Tasteless of letters; yet, to Fame, inclin'd, Busily viewless, and profoundly blind: Go, to thy Country's Hope, invoke his care; Watch, if he smiles, and, then, suspend despair; Bless his protective hand, that calls out Arts, And hail his Empire, o'er a people's hearts. To Lady W?, on seeing her in the Park, after her Recovery from a long Illness. Pleas'd, at your wish'd return, to chear the shade, For your long life, a pensive neighbour pray'd; Shock'd, and disgusted, at the modern fair, Vacant of thought, and turbulent of air; He hail'd your health, restor'd, who live, to prove, How, women, once, compell'd the wise, to love. How unaffected case, in motion, charms! How knowledge holds the heart, that sweetness warms! How thinking Spirit quickens every grace, Till the soul lightens, thro' the meaning face! Griev'd, to observe, what, now, the sex employs, Whose wit is laughter, and whose converse noise: Who loudly ignorant, and coarsely light, Repel men's reason, and offend their sight; Make youth distasteful, dignity despis'd, And every claim of beauty pass unpriz'd: Charm'd, he beheld, once more, your air sublime, In all, but wisdom, still unchang'd by time: Patterns, like you, may teach the faithless eye, What, in your absence, wou'd be judg'd a lye; Shou'd it be told these quenchers of Love's fire, That woman, once, was soft, and mov'd desire; By modest tenderness, compell'd respect, And, arm'd with Influence, never fear'd neglect: That friend, and lover both, she cou'd impart Peace to the mind, and passion to the heart, 'Twou'd, now, be thought a dream—but that, in you, They see such proof, that they must own, 'tis true. Live, then, a lengthening age of painless hours, Your Sex's envy—and the wish of ours. To Mr. GARRICK. On his united Ideas of Actor and Writer. Form'd for each other's aid, these powers but meet, As nature's self shows light, combin'd with heat: Oh! born, to grace their union, let 'em share Thy thoughts exertion, and reward thy care: The willing arts bid all their praise be thine; For thee, tun'd discords into musick join; What others, lab'ring hopeless, hardly gain, 'Twas thine, at once, to start for, and obtain. To instant growth, without gradation, drawn, High noon leapt backward, to embrace the dawn; Time and experience sunk, to speed thy way, And genius grasp'd creation, in a day! Nor let malignant envy blast thy claim, Since wit, and virtue, triumph, in thy fame. Oh! let no rogue, of damn'd Iago's race, To wile-try'd torture, rack that honest face: Seem, what thou art, brave, faithful, amorous, gay; The noblest passions please, the noblest way. Heart humaniz'd, head clear, hands clean, soul great, Sharp sense, mild manners, ease, adorning weight, Sun of our Stage, shine on: we feel thy light: Thy warmth how fruitful! and thy beam, how bright! Each guilt thou paint'st, by borrow'd art, is shown, But every goodness native, and thy own. On Sir ISAAC NEWTON. Oe'r nature's laws, God cast the veil of night, Out-blaz'd a Newton's soul—and all was light. To the Learned and Worshipful, the President, Censors, the Fellows, of the College of Physicians in London, The Humble Petition of Thomas Trade, of the said City, Wool-Stapler. That, in rhyme, I petition, you must not complain, For, I oft, have try'd reason, and found, 'twas in vain: The known sturdy beggar, who, now, craves your aid, Was, once, a fam'd citizen—honest Tom Trade; His father a clothier, his mother Creole, Bid their Son—a blunt, English, impolitic, soul, Always think what he pleas'd, and speak what he thought; And (a fool for my pains!) I e'en did, as I ought. Hence it came—and, no wonder, you Doctors will say, That my fortune turn'd tail, and fell to decay: How it happen'd, I know not; but, soon, from a Tun, I was shrunk to a Noggin—and fairly undone! From a fat, florid cheek, and an eye void of care, With a freeholder's belly, and bluff British air, I assum'd a lean, Spanish, lank, leathery, jaw, And look'd dry, tall, and yellow, and light, like a straw: Well! no matter, you'll say, for my air, or my face; So, I hasten, to sigh out my sorrowful case. There's a shameless old quack, by name Dr Shift, Who does very strange things, at a very dead lift; 'Twas to him, or to none, all agreed I must go, If I meant any better, or bigger, to grow. When I show'd him my bones, as they peep'd thro' my skin, And complain'd, what a dryness consum'd me, within; I must fleece thee, he cry'd, if thou wishest to live. De'el a lock (answer'd I) have they left me to give. Set your seal, then, to mortgage the hopes of your son, And the cure be my care, so the bus'ness is done. For, I ne'er cou'd ask fees, nor be seen any more, If my patients, so peel'd, were as sick, as before. With a trembling weak hand, I comply'd with his will, While he laugh'd, in my face, at due sense of his Skill. Don Mustacho, he cry'd—(and with arrogant mien, Came his surgeon, at call) “Here's a patient, too lean; “Take and purge him, one year; and then vomit him, two: “All the third, let him blood—and, if that shou'd not do, “Sweat him, six, nine, or twelve—and, at last, to work sure, “Let a blister all over make short with his cure.” Oons! a Doctor, said I!—and slunk back, in a fright, Don, the Devil, and You, will demolish me quite! Where's your conscience? D'you think such a poor dog, as I, Can be tapp'd at all ends, and yet never run dry? I'll complain to the college, and get 'em to trounce A horse-doctor, whom all honest beasts wou'd renounce. Now, ye learned and grave! you, who think, for our health; If a wretch deserves life, who has lost all his wealth, Let me hope due revenge, on this foe, to men's breath, Who wou'd cure a consumption, by bleeding to death. To CLIO: On her praising Mr. D?r, and shewing me some of his Verses. Matchless inspirer of my muse, and me, Thou heaven, of blended smiles, and Majesty! Thou, by whose light, all other's worth is shown, While thou art dark, as midnight, to thy own: Praising desert, like his, you charm me, too, And, for your blessing him, my thanks are due. Mean are the minds, who but their own possess, And reap no joy, from other's happiness. I groan, beneath their pains, whom sorrow wrings, And, when their hope is rising, mine has wings. O Clio! to deserve such praise from thee, Points out thy friend, a bosom one, for me, My sympathetic soul reveres his name, And my warm heart beats anxious, for his fame. Sweet are his thoughts, and soft, as evening air; Joy gilds his smiles,—his sighs invite despair: Strong is his sense, and his reflection deep, Wide, as his prospects—as his mountains steep; Oh! may he still be blest, with thy esteem, Oh! may thy charms, forever, be his theme! Vast is my wonder, at his Fancy's flight, Till I remember, whence his store was drawn; Clio, the inspirer Clio! lent him light, And spread soft influence, o'er his wid'ning dawn: Warm'd, by th' enliv'ning lustre of her beams, His rip'ning reason burnt with conscious glow; Blaz'd, in the radiant charmer's starry streams, And shed diffusive heav'n on all, below: Oh! thou soft sun of wit, and love's gay clime! Point but one ray of thy broad shine, on me, Then, shall my kindled soul flame out sublime, And glitter proudly, with thy friend and thee. On Two Lovely and Loving Sisters. When equal charms, in different colours dress'd, Have two sweet sisters rival persons bless'd, How kind is heaven, their minds, with love, to strike, And teach 'em both, to look, and think, alike! To the Editor of Albania, a Poem: Address'd to the Genius of Scotland, and dedicated to General Wade. Known, tho' unnam'd, since, shunning vulgar praise, Thy muse wou'd shine, and, yet, conceal her rays, Think thyself hid; and hope, in vain, to be Unseen, like light, that shews us all, we see. But, while thy readers are deny'd thy name, They feel, thy genius, and attest thy flame. They pity, too, in death, thy noteless friend, Poor by the generous aid, thy wealth wou'd lend, Prefac'd by thee, his feeble lights expire, Even, in producing, thou obscur'st, his fire. Not, but the muse had warm'd his youthful song! Bold were his notes! and his ideas strong! But, where domestic dearness warp'd his lays, And partial birth misled the patriot praise, Wilt thou not join, to blame the bounded zeal, That bids us, only, for our Country feel? Yes—Thou wilt censure this too scanty care, That shuts out pity, and appropriates prayer! Thou wilt enlarge affection, till it sees, Beyond itself, and pants for public ease. Stretch liberty—to disengage mankind, And, ev'n, from nature's byass, free the mind. What, tho' (we know not why) soft, inbred pride, Makes home, seem sweetest, and can choice misguide; Till native darkness erring taste constrains, And Lapland desarts rival Persia's plains. Let the soul's reach the heart's restraint reprove, And widen, to the world, our Country's love. Base are these local limits to men's hearts, That canton out humanity, in parts. Truth has no districts, to divide her toil; And virtue is at home, in every soil. Since, on one common globe, we neigh'bring, dwell, What narrower line shou'd man, from man expel. Each, born alike, and sons of nature, all, Human can ne'er, from care of human, fall. But passion's rapine, nature's union breaks, Not soil, but int'rest, all this difference makes: Born brothers, each, from each, wou'd something draw, Till ravag'd equity is shrunk to law: Blindly forgetful, that the whole is dust, We hate, for parts, nor feel ourselves unjust: Confine repute, to place; and praise, or rail, As self, or stranger, turns the varied scale: Till, sense grown harden'd, in her partial plea, Justice is crippled, into bribery. Thou!—son of liberty!—can'st shun this shelf; Loos'ning reflection, and out-launching self: Can'st burst the chain of custom, round the heart, And, from worst slavery—(that of reason)—start. Thou, on thy country's hills, can'st praise bestow, Yet stoop not the Encomium, to her snow! So, wants, confess'd, but strengthen merit's claim, And right, from wrong distinguish'd, fixes fame. When rock-fenc'd Scotland boasts her hardy race, Or English beauty claims but matchless grace; When France the praise of sprightliest wit assumes, And German plainness spreads its honest plumes; Concurring plaudits grant unquestion'd dues, And truth and reason sanctify the muse. But, shou'd Teutonic heaviness aspire, From French vivacity, to ravish fire; Or Caledonia's manlike virgins vie, With the soft sunshine of an English eye, Justice wou'd blush, at nature's erring pride, And each forc'd trophy be, by truth, deny'd. More just thy mind, more gen'rous is thy muse! Albanian born, this English theme to chuse! No partial flattery need thy verse invade, That, in the ear of Scotland, sounds a Wade! Such, as thy Muse, such is thy Patron's aim; Nor North, nor South, can bound his spirit's claim. Warm'd from within, he burns with Roman fires, Shines for the World: and, for Mankind, aspires; Adorning power, he beautifies a state; Endears dominion, and absolves the great. Kind, by his care, rapacious license grows; And polish'd jealousy no hatred knows: Felt in their hearts, to love of faith he charms, And, softly conqu'ring, needs no aid of arms. When (ages hence) his last line's length'ner dies, And his lost dust reveals not, where it lies: Still, shall his living greatness, guard his name, And his works lift him, to immortal fame. Then, shall astonish'd armies, marching high, O'er causeway'd mountains, that invade the sky, Climb the rais'd arch, that sweeps its distant throw, Cross tumbling floods, which roar, unheard, below: Gaze, from the Cliff's cut edge, thro' midway air, And, trembling, wonder at their safety, there! Pierce, fenny deeps, with firm, unsinking tread, And, o'er drain'd desarts, wholesome empire spread. While charm'd the soldier dwells, on wonders pass'd, Some Chief, more knowing, and more touch'd—at last, Shall (pointing) to the attentive files, explain, How (many a cent'ry since)—in George's Reign, Wade's working soul, that grac'd his Prince's throne, Built these vast Monuments—and spar'd his own. To Celia, with a return'd Tragedy. I Take, O Celia! muse divine! Take again the tragic tale: Wit, so light, if weigh'd with thine, Mounts, like feathers, from thy scale. II Yet, 'twere wise O soul of verse! Soft, to smile, upon his flight: Blazing tapers, scarce, wou'd pierce, Were there no such thing, as night. III Di'monds wou'd be less admir'd, Were not brittle christal known; And by Poets poorly fir'd, Our rich Celia's wealth is shown. IV But, alass! I strive, in vain, Worth, above me, to display: Sunk, beneath thy streamy strain; Like a Glow-worn, lost in day. To Lady W?. Age has but one defect—and that's decay: Your beauty fades not, and your graces stay; All the dear difference, that your years inspire, Is ripen'd wisdom, and increase of fire; Bright'ning, by age, you glow, like gold, in mines, That length of time corrodes not, but refines! Yet, from this groundless wrong, you've done your charms, Let my instructed wishes catch alarms; If your time's short—Ah! rob not, while you stay— Leave the night mine—or, you begloom the day. PROLOGUE For the third Night, at Zara, when first play'd, at the Great Musick Room, in Villars Street, York Buildings. He, whose wish'd service did my help engage, (Nor Actor I—nor studious of the stage!) To aid whose purpose, and support whose cause, This scene unaqual (to our Zara) draws: To night, by sickness, from this presence, held, Mourns his weak will, by want of power repell'd, Willing to please—and struggling to succeed, He's gone, from acting death—to die, indeed! Exhausted spirits, urging on decay, Wasted his strength, and wore his life away: 'Till from the stage, to his last bed, confin'd, He left us—But, he left his thanks, behind: Living, he owns his gratitude your due; And, if he dies—in death, he blesses you. For me, mean while—who can but what I can, To Osman's weight, is added Lusignan! Two parts, at once!—that height I fear to scale! Would he were here, to charm!—for, I shall fail, Musick was his—But now, by woes oppress'd, Sad Nightingale! the thorn is, at his breast; His suff'ring virtue! his undue distress! Learning, unprop'd! afflicted manliness! Sickness, and pain, with patience, holding strife! Wrestling with merit; and disjointing life! These are pretensions, which must, here, prevail, And touch your generous hearts—howe'er I fail. EPIGRAM, On Occasion of the General Mourning. Not I—I'll wear no black—why others do— Ay—let them mourn the old—I love the new, Fie! 'tis the fashion—Oh! the fashion?—well, News for your news, kind, courtly Sir—I'll tell— He, who but mourns, for fashion's sake, to day, To-morrow, will, for fashion's sake obey. EPILOGUE, For a Friend, Spoke by Miss Robinson. Little and light, myself like things in vogue; You'd guess me fond, of a light Epilogue; But you're mistaken—I've a taste, improving, And fancy nothing but what's strong and moving: You Ladies, too, spite of what criticks say, Lean all your judgments the same natural way. When Oratordos lull this tuneful nation, Who is not mov'd to strong—commiseration? When Harlequin jumps, nimbly, thro' the casement, All the charm'd house is mov'd to wise amazement! Then mark!—some well-writ Tragedy comes after; And that ne'er fails to move—your general laughter. Pleas'd, that we please—next, comedy, we play, And, then, the whole town's mov'd—to keep away. 'Twere endless, thus to tire your ears with proving; —Not a toupee, but's either mov'd—or moving! Gay belles are mov'd, to talk,—soft beaux, to stare, Players, to fret—poor poets are mov'd, to swear! And I, not last, in will, tho' least, in measure Am, in my turn, too, mov'd—to wish you pleasure: In fine, which way soe'er your taste may run ye, Our Managers are mov'd—to get your money. Move ne'er so strangely—I'll be short and pithy We should move poorly—did not we move with ye. EPILOGUE, for a Friend. Well! the Play's over,—and the author's waiting, To hear his cause supported, by my prating; But, he mistakes the favour I intend him;— Have at him—I shall courtier like, defend him. Oh! 'tis provoking, how these poets wrong us, When, with imaginary loves, they throng us, Like girls, they give us trinkets, to look gay with, Which, when night comes, we have no right, to play with, Strange doctors, these! our appetites they quicken, And, then, remove the feast, for fear we sicken. To think of only one, when twenty love us! Can flesh and blood bear that?—no—that's above us. We'd make a shift, with one—did but one proffer: If we try ten—the fault is theirs, who offer. Weak woman, push'd, and press'd, now here, now there, Falls, not, by choice—but want of strength, to bear. Surrounded, as I was, by slaves, to night, Troth, I e'en thought, to take all five—was right! Since I'd enough for all—what harm, to barter, And deal with each, for his own, separate quarter? Worthy possess'd my will—my Lord my eye, Grinly my spleen—my scorn Sir Lubberly. Chip had my laughter;—every Man his part, And room for forty more, in woman's heart, As, when some City-Worthy mounts Lord-Mayor, Mere dignity requires, that folks shou'd stare, Rob'd, he looks big—and rides the streets, in state, While, in long order, his puff'd nothings wait: So, when a toast assumes her envied reign, A length of coxcombs ought to grace her train: Dear Nizies! never heed, what's said, about ye, Woman, is woman—and can't live without ye. Fools are the froth of life—they give no merit, Yet brisk it, like champaign, with sparkling spirit. BRITAIN, the Queen of nations! let us see, What the world's offerings should to beauty, be: Bright, and unrivall'd, 'midst the sea, she stands, Attracting tribute, from remotest lands. From Afric, Gold—from India, gems she draws, Yet, mix'd with these, come—Parrots,—Apes,—Maccaws, Civet and assa fætida, unite, And all, that shocks or charms—taste, touch, and sight, From these, she chuses all, she wants—the rest She leaves, for poorer states, who like 'em, best. So, gay coquets shou'd man's whole homage claim; Wits, fools, beaux, slovens—every rank, and name; All, should adore, divert,—attempt—and please, Encrease her business—and adorn her ease. Yet, among all, she keeps but what's most taking, And spares the rest, for prudes—whose hearts are breaking. PROLOGUE. Spoke by young Mr. Giffard. The authors Prologue having claim'd your care, Hear, next th' address of an unfriended player, Forc'd, as in war, his abler leaders gone, To fill their ranks, by stepping boldly on: There, thrown too forward, into points of sight, He trembles, conscious of th' excess of light. YOUNG, and untaught as yet, myself to trust, I plead their pity, who have tastes, too just. In Plays, which practis'd actors, long, have fill'd, How great his danger, who succeeds, unskill'd! The self-known diff'rence must, with terror, strike; The part, less painful, than your due dislike. In scenes, untry'd, he moves, with easier heart, There, uncompar'd, he shrinks not, from his part; Unprejudic'd—you aid his first essays, And push his panting hope, with generous praise. But, task us not, too hard, who wait our day, Be partial, if at all, the noblest way: Indulge some notice, where we chance to touch, Nor think, who longs to please, presumes, too much. EPILOGUE, for a Friend. Of all the tricks, these Poets bring in vogue, Methinks, their strangest whim, is Epilogue: Hard task, on us, poor damsels of the stage! A Bard's long, tiresome, bauble, fires your rage; And, when that rage inflames you, to abhor him, He pops in one of us, to cool you, for him. 'Tis an ungentle treatment, to perplex, With strongest danger, thus, the weakest sex; Troth, one wou'd think—but custom's hard to stem, That they shou'd do for us—not we for them! At least, since each was made, to join with either, In downright conscience, both shou'd move, together. But, be it so!—I care not, tho' I venture, Cou'd I but see, on what soft side to enter: Grave Gentlemen!—some, of you, look so sadly, That, troth! I fear—I shall come off but badly. Yet, hang it, I'm engag'd—th' event I'll try, And, if I'm doom'd to fall—why there I lie. For our new Author, then, and for his Play, I have one vast, important truth to say: Smile, on his hopes, do—for my sake, forbear him, Not, that my wishes bid your Justice spare him: But shou'd you not—you will but make me trouble! He'll write, till you approve, and plague me, double. PROLOGUE, to Every Man in his Folly. Spoke by Mr. Quin. You call the stage, a glass; and look, to find The imag'd passion, and reflected mind: Yet, in one point, our glass, but ill agrees With yours, where each his own resemblance sees: Whereas, in ours, each self is, dimly, shown, But, ev'ry other's likeness, strongly, known! 'Tis the same thing, in life—Nature is kind, And, to home-follies, keeps us wisely blind: Else, what dejected wits!—what crest-fall'n airs! Shou'd none dare rally a defect, he shares! Each eye, turn'd inward, less wou'd there be seen, To raise the spirits, than provoke the spleen! Yet, tho' self-censure might disturb the gay, And pride turn, startled, from the sad survey; Rightly conceiv'd, the oft examin'd pain, Wou'd slowly ripen, into solid gain: Each, losing something, to the common store, Wou'd, from the general profit, draw back more. What malice miss'd, benevolence wou'd find, And joy, and peace, re-fill the balanc'd mind. Fix'd on this point, and bending to the wise, Our Author, not his wit, but reason, tries: Full, to your view, presents that partial pride, By which all weakness, but our own, is try'd; Each can, with eagle's eye, the frailty see, Which none more practises, more loves, than he! All, we propose; all, we dare wish, or hope, Lies, circumscrib'd, within this humble scope; Weigh the design, and, where small faults, you find, Let the clouds pass, and watch the light, behind. EPILOGUE, for the Play, call'd Much ado about nothing,) Spoke by Mrs Pritchard. Hold her not thankless, that (oblig'd by you) She thus, with nothing, pays, your Much ado: 'Tis the world's frugal mode, and each wise nation Keeps weights, and scales of air, for obligation. Sunshine pretence ends, oft, in rainy weather; And many a head's best boast—is hat and feather! Trust nothing, but your wives—we plot no treason, 'Till unkind husband's cease, to do us reason. But, as for wit, fame, taste—they're mere deceivers: Ev'n politic's shew teeth, but bite believers. WHO, that has seen high-posted zeal, peace-hating, Raise dust for Ins, and Outs, by turns debating, E're guess'd, till time and chance, set crowds a staring, That Outs, and Ins, gave coats, with all one bearing! Who, that, of late, saw bold Rebellion's standard Rais'd, rounded, common-soldier'd, and commander'd, Hop'd, at a spurt, to see such schemes, to cramp us Scatter'd, and scouting back, to brouze Mount Grampus! WHO, ye bloom'd fair! most us'd to soft protesting, And hardly brought to think, love's wounds but jesting, Sees her scorch'd victim, at her feet expiring, And dreams he'll come to life, for other's firing? All, that you see, touch, taste, hear, wish, or dream on, Is but deceit's broad bog, to build esteem on. Our Shakespear knew mankind, and rightly drew 'em; And, as for women, faith he peep'd quite thro' 'em. I, and my Benedick, each sex emblazing, Shew neither over-fit, for either's praising. All brought to all, each lives to gull the other, And Disappointment closes love's long pother. Tho' much ado is passion's loud beginning, 'Tis about nothing—still, and not worth winning. But, I forget my cue—thus humbly low, Serious, I pay the solid thanks, I owe. Warm'd, by quick sense of your protective praise, Inflaming gratitude more worth may raise. Bid unforc'd laughter rise, from native strains, And free-touch'd humour shun distortive pains. Bid tears, unwhining, find their source within, And, from touch'd hearts, the band's applause begin. Un-borrow'd be my pow'r, or none at all; Let me, on pity, not for pity, call. Failing to move your grief, were judgment's fault, For sorrow moves me, first, by nature, taught; Nature, in unaffected freedom, drest, By plain simplicity, hits passion, best. Shown, like your virtues, [to the gentlemen] strongest, without glare, And, like your beauties, [to the ladies] without paint, most fair. Verses written, on Windows in several Parts of the Kingdom, in a Journey to Scotland. [Letters, from absent friends, extinguish fear] Letters, from absent friends, extinguish fear, Unite division, and draw distance near; Their magic force each silent wish conveys, And wafts embody'd thought, a thousand ways: Cou'd souls to bodies, write, death's power were mean, For minds cou'd, then, meet minds, with heaven, between. [Order! thou eye of action! wanting thee] Order! thou eye of action! wanting thee, Wisdom works, hoodwink'd, in perplexity: Entangled reason trips, at every pace, And truth, bespotted, puts on error's face [Tender-handed stroke a nettle] Tender-handed stroke a nettle, And it slings you, for your pains: Grasp it, like a man of mettle, And it soft as silk, remains. 'Tis the same, with common natures, Use 'em kindly, they rebel: But, be rough as Nutmeg-graters, And the rogues obey you well. [How is the world deceiv'd, by noise, and show!] How is the world deceiv'd, by noise, and show! Alas! how diff'rent, to pretend and know! Like a poor, high-way brook, pretence runs loud Bust'ling, but shallow, dirty, weak, and proud: While, like some nobler stream, true knowledge glides, Silently strong, and its deep bottom hides. [Whig and Tory scratch and bite] Whig and Tory scratch and bite, Just, as hungry dogs we see: Toss a bone 'twixt two, they fight, Throw a couple, they agree. [Women talk of love for fashion] Women talk of love for fashion, So they do, of Spirit's walking: But no more they feel the passion, Than they see the ghost of which they're talking. [Have a care, gay, young, and wanton] Have a care, gay, young, and wanton, Give no ground, for love to plant on; Guard against the fair deceiver, See and hear, but don't believe her: Or, if nothing seems unjuster, Than to love, and yet distrust her: On your side to turn the laughter, Try her, first, and trust her, after. [Here, in wet, and windy, weather] Here, in wet, and windy, weather, Muse, and I, two mopes, together, Far, from friends and short of pleasure, Wanting every thing, but leisure: Scarce content, in any one sense, Tell the showers, and scrible nonsense. [Where'er the diamond's busy point could pass] Where'er the diamond's busy point could pass, See! what deep wounds have pierc'd the middle glass! While partial and untouching, all the rest, Highest and lowest panes, shine, unimpress'd: No wonder, this!—For, e'en in life, 'tis so; High fortunes stand, unreach'd—unseen the low, But middle states are marks, for every blow. [As, in a journey, just begun] As, in a journey, just begun, We think the distance, vast, Yet, while we travel, gayly, on, Insensibly, 'tis past. So, in our youth, we measure slow, Long views of promis'd breath: 'Till, like a shadow, out we go, And vanish, into death. [Were Women wise, their names on glass] Were Women wise, their names on glass, Light froth of empty fashion! Wou'd, to their lovers sorrow, pass For proofs of brittle passion. Love should, in secret, like the sun, Burn, tho' a world should shade it; But shows it source of heat, to none, Except that God, who made it. [Whisp'ring close a maid, long courted] Whisp'ring close a maid, long courted, Thus, cry'd Drone, by touch transported; Prithee, tell me, gentle Dolly! Is not loving long a folly? Yes, said she, with smile reproving, Loving long, and only loving. The Distinction of Ages. The seven first years of life, (man's break of day) Gleams of short sense a dawn of thought display, When fourteen springs have bloom'd his downy cheek, His soft, and blushful meanings learn to speak, From twenty one, proud manhood takes its date, Yet is not strength compleat, 'till twenty eight: Thence, to his five and thirtieth, life's gay fire, Sparkles, burns loud, and flames, in fierce desire. At forty two his eyes grave wisdom wear, And the dark future dims him o'er with care; On, to the nine and fortieth, toils increase, And busy hopes and fears disturb his peace, At fifty six cool reason reigns, intire, Then, life burns steddy, and with temp'rate fire. But sixty three unbinds the body's strength, E'er th' unwearied mind has run her length; And, when, from seventy, age surveys her last, Tir'd, she stops short—and wishes, all were past. Description of a Tempest, from CVII Psalm. They, who, in ships, the seas vast depths descend, And, o'er the wat'ry world, their passage bend; They (more than all) their God's great works discern, And midst th' unfathom'd deep his wonders learn. There, from smooth calms, on sudden storms they rise, Hang on the horrid surge, and skim the skies! Now, high as heaven, they climb their dreadful way, Now, sink in gulphy slants, and lose the day! Giddy, they reel, to shoot the frightful steep, And their souls melt, amid the sounding sweep! Helpless, they cling to what supports 'em, first, And, o'er 'em feel the breaking billows burst. Then, to their last almighty hope, they cry, Who hears, and marks 'em, with a pitying eye: He bids the storm be hush'd—The Winds obey; And the aw'd Waves, in silence, shrink away, Woman's Resolution. Oh!—cry'd Arsenia, long, in Wedlock blest, Her head reclining, on her husband's breast, Should death divide thee, from thy doating wife, What comfort could be found in widow'd life? How the thought shakes me!—Heaven my Strephon save, Or, give the lost Arsenia half his grave! JOVE heard the lovely mourner and approv'd: “And should not wives, like this, said he, be lov'd? “Take the soft sorrower at her word, and try, “How deeply rooted Woman's vows can lie?” 'Twas said, and done—the tender Strephon dy'd; Arsenia, two long months—t'out live him try'd, But in the third—alas! became a bride, EPITAPH. Upon a Man, and his Wife. Stay, Bachelor! if you have wit! A wonder to behold! Husband and Wife, in one dark pit, Lye close, and never scold! Tread softly though,—for fear she wakes; Hark! she begins, already? You've hurt my head—my shoulder akes: These sots can ne'er move steady. Ah, friend, with happy freedom blest! See! how my hope's miscarried! Not death itself, can give you rest, Unless you die, unmarried. EPILOGUE, To Every Man in his Folly, Spoke by Mrs Clive. SILENCE—sit down, Sirs—hats off—that will do— I know, you love a joke, if it be new; You smart ones of the pit—I speak to you, Criticks—mistake me not, for I protest, Not one of you are aim'd at in the jest; But, I perceive, among you, some of those, Our author has, to night, thought fit t'expose, You, Virtuosi—Connoisseurs—and Beaux. A poet may—by just Dramatic laws, Except against such jurors in his cause, As parties, in the suit.—His humble prayer, Is therefore only to the wise, and fair, For this first fault, the criminal you'd spare. 'Tis from the life, his characters are shewn, You're, first, invited here—then pencil'd down: They, only, are to blame—who will the likeness own. As for example—here's my Lord and I, Perhaps, this circle may'nt the like supply; O, yes, it does!—I have you, in my eye! And, gad,—you're no unfashionable pair, But, hush—sit still—you own it, if you stir. In Araminta! pha!—ill-judging creature! He has not hit you; in one single feature: To make her, squeamishly, reject a lover, When ev'ry trial, that cou'd shock, was over, And nought remain'd, but what, with joy, shou'd move her. She is no woman, faith—who, in that station, Cou'd run the dangerous risk—of hesitation: Gad!—we're for no such ticklish situation! Give us a certainty, however small, It must be better, sure!—than none at all. But hold—what need have I, such truths to tell? You penetrating devils!—you know't, too well. Next—of our author's humour, wit, and plot, Style, chaste expression, and—I know not what: I saw, how 'twas—and faith—I ask'd him, plainly, If he propos'd success, from being cleanly? I bid him, here and there, throw in a scene, (But, pray says I—take care, 'tis wrapt up clean,) Of something, psha!—you all know, what I mean. I own, I blush'd,—but he blush'd more, than I, And said—if I can tell you—let me die. What do you think the silly creature said? That his chaste muse had yet—her maidenhead, And should not be a prostitute, egad. But now—I have a word, or two, to say To you, who feel the satire of the Play: What! you expect—that I should court your favour, Curt'sy and pray;—I scorn such poor behaviour: Don't you all know, when you, with us, dispute, We have an argument to strike you mute? And, as friend Bays has said—look to't—we'll do't. Then yeild, at once—nor, 'gainst our poet, thunder: I'll try, if you, or I, will be kept under. PROLOGUE to the Tuscan Treaty. Now, mercy on our poet:—for the pit Will ne'er judge, kindly, of so rash a wit; Who, 'twixt two fairs, untimely, makes pretence, To please, by Tragedy, and Common sense. Troth, 'tis a wild adventure! tho' his play Were double-arm'd, and guarded every way. What! tho' our scene does tyrants disapprove; And smiles on vertue, liberty, and love? What, tho' a minion meets with ill success, While a good statesman helps his King, to bless? Still, 'tis but labour lost, to hope succeeding: Where the court's empty, what avails fine pleading? We reap no summer harvests,—player and printer, Bloom, like your Glassonbury thorn, in winter. And you, yourselves, (thank heaven!) have ne'er sound reason, To bear with good instruction, out of season. All this I told him, plainly—but he hears not: He knows your tastes, it seems—and, therefore, fears not: Tho' half the world runs mad, (says he)—depend on't, Good sense has some friends left—and there's an end on't. The Muse to the Writer. A Translation from the French of Dubartas. I Scarce was the April of my life begun, When anxious to immortalize my name, Pleasure, and soft repose, I learnt to shun, And lab'ring, upward, sought the mounts of fame. II But, as a traveller, in viewless plains, Stops, amid crossing roads, and doubts his way; Pensively searchful, and, unsure, remains, Eager to journey on, yet, loth to stray. III So stopt, and so unfix'd, I mark'd, around, The flow'ry paths, that led to groves of Bays: But, pausing doubtful, long confusion found, Which, best to chuse, of all those tempting ways. IV One while, my genius plan'd the glowing scene, And from the Grecian source, example drew: Taught pride to pity; ignorance to mean; And form'd the many, by the suff'ring few. V Anon domestic discord, snatch'd my pen; My Country's woes I, now, aspir'd to feel: Historic truths, and wrongs of injur'd men, Impell'd my justice, and inflam'd my zeal. VI Then sinking sudden, from the glorious height, Low mercenary praises quench'd my fire: Poorly, a flatt'rer, I for profit, write, And, to my fortune, tune my tortur'd lyre. VII At length, grown lazy, I, by love, was caught, And, finding age, and taste, and will, too fit, In warm light sallies, wanton lessons taught, And, to the size of Cupid, cropt my wit. VIII While roving, thus, uncenter'd, and unstaid, I lik'd, by turns, and did, by turns, refuse: Sudden, before me, a descending maid Confess'd the shape of a cœlestial muse. IX All, that we dream of angels, form'd her air; Sweet was her gesture, and her step divine: But, when she spoke, she would have charm'd despair, And taught the gloom of wither'd age, to shine. X High, from her head, aspir'd a starry crown, Immensely, beaming its effulgence round: An azure mantle flow'd, obliquely down, And, bright with lamps of silver, swept the ground. XI MORTAL! she cry'd, Urania's face behold! Urania—muse, of all the heavenly nine, Best skill'd—the paths of glory to unfold, And make the poet (like his art) divine. XII I, thro' the dancing numbers, breathe a soul, And, to the sound of reason, tune mankind: I teach true pleasures false ones to controul, And warm the yielding heart, to stamp the mind. XIII Mark me, and keep my image, long, in sight, And, when departed to my starry sphere, Strike this new harp, and, from it, draw delight, By sounds, that list'ning angels love to hear. XIV Long, have I mourn'd my sister's sully'd fame, By friendless mirth, or chearless malice, stain'd; Cramp'd by cold flatteries, that blight their name, Or, by wild warmths of loose desire, profan'd. XV But, most, I grieve that rebel waste of wit, Which, boldly, pushing its infernal claim, With darkness, for such blind presumption, fit, Turns its own arms, on Heaven, with impious aim. XVI Learnt are the vulgar arts—But Poets draw, From heaven alone, the Gift, that wings their fire: Not the best lights, that ever learning saw, Could living verse, by study'd strength, inspire. XVII Thence 'tis, that Homer, powerless, poor, and blind, Beggar, himself, has taught e'en kings to shine: Buoy'd sinking heroes, by fresh floods of mind, And stretch'd the human grasp, with reach divine. XVIII Thence 'tis, that Ovid could not speak, in prose, But wept in measure, and expir'd, in verse: Thence, the Jessæan lyre, to musick rose, Which seraphs, in their Maker's Ear, rehearse. XIX Read, meditate, reflect, grow wise—in vain; Try every help; force fire, from every spark; Yet, shall you ne'er the poet's power attain, If heaven ne'er stamp'd you, with the muses mark. XX Man must be, out of man, sublimely swell'd, Whose wreckless verse wou'd swim the storms of time, By force, not fury, meaningly, impell'd, To scorn the puny prostitutes of rhyme. XXI The warmth of fury but compassion moves, And less than man, makes man, to man, appear: But warmth of genius, man, from man, removes, And lifts his wid'ning soul, to Heaven's high sphere. XXII Mark this soft Flute—when, void of vocal wind, In tuneless silence, rests the sleeping sound: Yet, when thus breath'd in, hark! what power 'twill find, To waft the modulated raptures round! XXIII So, 'till the whisp'ring God-head bids—begin, The poet's silent spirit stands unbent: But, when he feels th' inspiring power, within, Tuneful, he spreads the transports, heaven has lent. XXIV Since, therefore, all, that makes his genius shine, Is heaven's own gift,—how dares he subjects chuse Base, and unworthy, of that warmth divine, And poorly noxious, to the passive muse? XXV Why is his pen employ'd, on idle themes? Why is his fancy light? his purpose low? Why does he waste his fire, in fruitless dreams? And, with a tide of wanton wishes, flow? XXVI Why does he stoop to praise unletter'd pride? Why celebrate defects, in those, who rule? Why does his wit soft, am'rous trains provide, And bid love's wild fire catch, from fool to fool? XXVII Ah! 'tis too much, that he, himself, has crimes, Which, unrepented, ne'er unpunish'd go: Why would he lend his guilt to distant times, And teach an un-born race, to merit woe? XXVIII As, on the yielding wax, the seal we find, Left in strong likeness, with imprinted glow; So does the reader steal the poet's mind, And, to the byas lent, inclining go. XXIX Shame on your pens, ye flexible of heart! Whose poorness does not hurt yourselves alone, But teaches blockheads to despise your art; Judg'd by false patterns, you have, lightly, shewn. XXX Conscious of this, wou'd you but turn, at last, And bid true genius, with true lustre, shine; All would, admiring, lose th' impression past, And feel, and own you, of a stamp divine. XXXI Then, as my Moses his Jehovah sung, And Israel, wafted by the guardian rod: Poets, from every kindling country, sprung, Shall, in a thousand tongues, uncover God. XXXII O, you! who wou'd the deathless laurel win, No King's vile badge, but time's all-rev'rend crown! High, as the fountain, of your verse begin, And, with the God, you write for, share renown. XXXIII This is a subject, that, out-stretching thought, Thro' depths, unsounded, wit's long plummet draws: There, by immense effects, immensely taught, Pour out your straining souls, and claim applause. XXXIV There, and there only, find the road to fame; The hardiest themes, the noblest glory yield: On low, light subjects, scorn to build a name; But, ent'ring boldly, plow th' untrodden field. XXXV Vainly, shall envy blast your budding praise; Malice and hatred, vainly, press you down: Slow shall you rise, indeed, but sure to blaze, And, hourly broad'ning, reach decreed renown. XXXVI Envy's a curr, that, at all Strangers, barks; But, on the known and licenc'd, creeps to fawn: It's hov'ring smoke, hangs hard, on kindling sparks, But, when the fire burns up, 'tis, strait withdrawn. XXXVII On then, be mine—Urania hears your pray'r; Glows, in your breast, and fans it's gen'rous flame: Write, to be read—be times to come, your care, And bloom, forever fragrant, still the same. XXXVIII She said: and breath'd, ambrosial, o'er my face: The circling sweetness swell'd my ravish'd mind; She rose; and left me, in an empty space; But left her pow'rful influence, still behind. An ODE, to Astræa From the French of Dubartas. I Fairest Pattern, from above, Tho' I only live, for love, 'Tis not for those sparkling eyes: Tho' the stars, that gild the skies, When the twinklers shine most bright, So compar'd, have lost their light. Tho' the sun, in all his blaze, Sees that smile, and hides his rays. II 'Tis not, that my fancy dips, In the Rainbow's red, thy lips, 'Tis not ev'n thy lips, that please: Tho' the happiest Hybla bees, When they rob the flow'ry spring, Never ply'd the busy wing, Charg'd with honey, half so sweet, As 'twou'd be, those lips to meet. III 'Tis not your neglect of air, Far out-charming others care; Nor those locks, that fall, resign'd, Catch'd, and courted, by the wind: Tho' the drifts of glitt'ring sand, Strow'd o'er Africk's yellow strand, Ne'er, to charm ambition, roll'd Half such tempting veins of gold. IV 'Tis not to those polish'd rows, 'Twixt whose openings, musick flows; That I find my offerings due, Vows, so tender, and so true! Tho' the pearl-producing East, Ne'er did Europe's wonder feast, Spite of all its toothy store, With such Ivory, before. V 'Tis not that declining waist, Nor that neck, so sweetly grac'd; Nor the pantings of that breast, (Soft as pity, and as blest!) I cou'd even that breast defy: Tho' were Læda's swan but nigh All its Down wou'd fail to show, Half so white, and soft a snow. VI When that forehead I behold, (Smooth, as flatt'ry, and as cold! 'Tis not its majestic frown, Throws my heart's defences down: Tho' the silver moon, at height, Shines less aweful, thro' the night, Than the meanings of that brow Shoot correction at me, now. VII 'Tis not, that this azure vein Marks your arm, with heav'n's own stain, While, along the white, it flows, Swell'd with triumph, as it goes: 'Tis not this engaging hand, Holds my Heart, in soft command; Tho', to hear it touch the lute, Rocks wou'd speak,—and birds grow mute. VIII Teach me, then, mysterious fair, What your power to charm? and where? If this flame of my desire, Did not, at your eyes, catch fire: If those lips (how sweet they be!) Have not, thus, entangled me; Tell me, what my heart cou'd move? Teach me, whence arose my love? IX If those ringlets of your hair, Did not string this amorous snare; If that beauteous mouth has fail'd, Nor those ivory teeth prevail'd: Tell me, what resistless cause, Felt unknown, my fancy draws? Still, unpleas'd, but where you are, Still untaught, what pleases, there! X Since those breasts—(how soft they rise!) Reach no farther, than my eyes; Since I count a thousand charms, None of which my heart disarms: Let your still-uncounted store Guide my search, to find out more, 'Till the cause I learn to know, Pleasing cause! that charms me so. XI Ah! 'tis found—delightful truth! Sense, with beauty, temp'ring youth.— 'Tis that peerless soul, of thine, Breaks, like daylight, into mine; Charg'd, with heaven's ætherial flame! Full of charms, without a name! 'Tis thy converse, turn'd to move, Claims respect, and forces love. PROLOGUE, To the Double Deceit. Poets misled by fondness for their own, Think, the same fondness actuates the town: Like the charm'd parent, that its child surveys, And wonders, any, with less joy, can gaze: Till better taught, both see their weakness, plain, And, by their former joy, now, weigh their pain. Convinc'd of this, (e'er an example made) Our bard, by no self-love will be betray'd: To your free judgments, he submits his cause, And asks, from what you feel yourselves, applause, Yet, from your justice, dares this hope maintain, You take no joy, to give another—pain, JUDGMENT, oft, varies, as th' affected mind Is, from within, to joy, or grief, inclin'd: If pleas'd, the well wrote play affords delight, And each gay scene looks gayer, in your sight: If vex'd—(as sorrow disinclines the brain,) The poet suffers, for your private pain. Above each weakness, dare, from sense alone, To praise, or blame, what will, to night, be shown; If to the task unequal, he shou'd seem; Th' attempt, to please you, merits some esteem: If he should please—remove, at once, his pain; Applause will make him grateful, but not vain. The humble Petition of Pegasus to the White Horse of H?r. Right humbly, fair Cuz! in these presents, is shown, By your kinsman most loving, tho' poor and unknown, That, since all your delight is in bounding and prancing, I have wings, at my back, that might help your advancing. Therefore, pray, tell your owner, who loves to aspire, He must cherish our stud, if he means to ride higher: 'Tis the gift of our breed, and the task of our calling, Both, to bear men aloft, and to keep 'em, from falling: All the plates, which his bounty, bestows, on you racers, But encourage good Runners, which ne'er make good Chasers. Not my lord, nor his groom, nor the rat-catcher's mare, Can forsake the dull earth, and get foremost, in air; But were Pegasus spurr'd, by crown-plates, to move faster, He wou'd rise, from this world, and win next, for his master: You'll forgive me this scrawl, tho' it comes the wrong way,— But S?r R?t's too busy, to mind, what I say. And, tho' oft, he spares money, to buy an ass traces, Won't subscribe a gold plate, for the Helicon races. EPILOGUE, To Zara Spoke by Miss C?, in Boy's Cloaths. Ladies, 'twill give but very little pain t'ye, When such a tiny thing, as I, complain t'ye. Were I grown big, and bold enough, to charm ye, I'd do't—but, for the world, I wou'dn't harm ye. Alas!—we've lost our stage;—whereon to strut, Was the unlicenc'd claim of Lilliput. Yet, here, where never patent monarch reign'd! We see our ground, by strange usurpers, gain'd! On our own soil condemn'd to over laying, By these dramatic rats, in mouse-hole playing; Ah! do us right—Since like with like engages, Give little actors way, on little stages. One poor pretence they urge—but strain'd their wit for't, That we'er too young, for business, and unfit for't. Lord! how some folks will lie!—from truth, he flinches, Who measures our ability, by inches. You know—'tis young and lively—old and crazy— Then, short, and sweet's the word—but—long, and lazy. All things, that please, are short—no—short caressings, I fear, you'd, all, give up;—and chuse—long, blessings. Well!—such be yours, if after they've done playing, You come, and make our troop amends, for staying. EPIGRAM, On giving the Name of Georgia to a Part of Carolina. While, rip'ning slow, the future purpose lay, And conscious silence plann'd th' op'ning way; Kind, o'er the rising scheme, an angel hung, And dropt this counsel, from his guardian tongue. Wish you, this way, the royal pair inclin'd? To Carolina be a Georgia join'd— Then, shall both colonies sure progress make, Endear'd to either, for the other's sake: Georgia shall Carolina's favour move; And Carolina bloom, by George's love. A Letter from a departed Spirit; to the Author (Mr. Pope) of a Lady's Character, lately publish'd, in a Thursday's Journal. Stript, to the naked soul, escap'd, from clay, From doubts, unfetter'd; and dissolv'd, in day: Unwarm'd, by vanity; unreach'd, by strife, And all my hopes, and fears, thrown off, with life: Why am I charm'd, by Friendship's fond essays, And, tho' unbody'd, conscious of thy praise? Has pride a portion, in the parted soul? Does passion still, the formless mind controul? Can gratitude out-pant the silent breath? Or, a friend's sorrow pierce the glooms of death? No—'tis a spirit's nobler taste of bliss! That feels the worth, it left, in proofs, like this: That, not its own applause, but thine, approves, Whose practice praises, and whose virtue loves! Who liv'st, to crown departed friends, with fame, Then dying late, shall all, thou gav'st, reclaim. The CIVth Psalm. I. Let my exalted harp be doubly strung! High-tune thy praise, my soul! and let thy God be sung! See! how around his throne the conscious rays Shoot quiv'ring, with continuous curve, and tremble in their blaze! See! what soul-shaking majesty, effulgent, he displays! Cloath'd with embodied light, see! where he stands! Pointing wide his dread commands! As earth's dim flames, o'erwhelm'd by streaming day, Beneath the sun-beams die away, The sun, full met, with cover'd face, retires, Burns inward, and rolls back his frighted fires! Gracious, th' unequal eye of man to skreen! See! where the maker kindly shades the too resplendent scene! And, like a curtain, widely drawn, spreads out whole heaven, between. Look! now, amazing! where he glides! Look! where yon gathering host of clouds, he dreadfully bestrides! And, aweful, on those self-roll'd chariots, rides! He moves! he walks, upon the swift-wing'd wind! He steps, from world to world, at once, and leaves even thought, behind! II. Myriads of hovering angels croud the God-grac'd scene to fill! Angels! fit heralds for th' almighty's will! Ten thousand fiery light'nings sweep his way! Nimble Couriers of his sway! And, round his temples, hissing swift, in blue Mæanders, play! The firm-fix'd balance of the self-poiz'd globe, To neither byas, partial sway'd, Became thus just, at his great word, and lastingly obey'd! At his command, the covering deep, drew off the world's wet robe; Gave back, and fill'd the chanels, he had made! But, peeping o'er the hills, reluctant staid; Displeas'd with its new bounds, but more afraid, Its old to re-invade! E'en yet the stubborn-hearted flood, no more High-licenc'd, as before, Disdains to give its proud repinings o'er: Oft, with bold murmurs, it alarms the shore, And, now and then, with rebel rage, breaks out, in general roar! But, when presumptuous billows swell, too high, And sprinkle heaven's eternal eye: Streight, all the thunders of God's voice, in loud resentment, rise; The starting flood hears, shakes, and flies! Down sinks the quash'd aspirer, from the skies, And, hush'd, in humble flatness, lies! Yet, if the sovereign will but nods, black oceans quit their bed! Foamy, they lash each other on, with high discovering head! And, curling, climb the steepy hills, and, o'er drown'd mountains spread! Thence call'd again, again they rush! confessing God's controul! Again let loose, reseek their sandy beds! Tumble, for haste, o'er one another's heads! And, sweeping with resistless breadth, o'er delug'd kingdoms roll! Fierce, as they are, they're subject to his check! They know th' appointed bounds, and watch th' imperious beck! III. From the huge treas'ry of the briny deep, Thro' thousand earth-form'd lab'rinths, taught to slide, In search of springs, the salt-stript waters creep, And trickling thence, into sweet rivers glide. Smooth-travelling, to seek their mazy way! And, devious, 'twixt th' enamour'd hills, slowly, delightful, stray; These God appointed thus to flow, exhaustless, stores of drink, Where every beast may quench his thirst, that seeks the smiling brink! And, in the shady groves, which on their borders, rise! He hous'd the warbling songsters of the skies! The pride-swoln mountains, which ambitious grow, And, neighb'ring heaven, disdain the world, below, Nor will, to humble brooks, refreshment owe, He waters, with th' ætherial seas, or coronets of snow! Amazing goodness! where's the smallest space! That does not feel, and boast his grace? For cattle's food, green flourishes, the flow'r-embroider'd mead: For man's free use, is every fruit decreed: For him, th' inspiring grape was taught to bleed; Bread-bearing corn makes glad the labourer's toil; And his rough skin grows supple, smooth'd with oil. IV. When, at fix'd times, up rolls the changeful moon, God shoots her shadowy gleam, thro' night's black noon! Rapid, as is the ever-wheeling sun, He dares not measure heaven, one thought, too soon? Yet, at God's word, the flag of day is furl'd, And licenc'd darkness rises o'er the world! Then, does the gloomy forest quake! And all th' assembled savage kind their holiday, then, make! Leaf-trembling trees, in silent horror, shake! And panting herds creep, terrified, away! While the stern lion, hungry, roars, and stalks abroad, for prey! God suffers him the needful prey to take! And, then, new-wakes the day! Out breaks the sun, and, to their dens, the beasts fly swift away! Almighty power! how dost thou thought confound! What human search can trace thy mazy round? How wisely, and how vastly, Lord! are all thy wonders done! Not earth, alone, does, with thy wealth, abound, But all, above, and all beneath the sun! V. The sea's wild herds, as well as those, on land, Rough-moulded sons, too! of thy formful hand, All live and move by thy command: The horrid wonders of that scene, fatigue the akeing eye, There, wave-toss'd ships the op'ning depths defy! And, circly, thro' th' imprison'd winds, their diff'rent courses ply! There does Leviathan, wide-wallowing, lie: And, while his broad, unweildy sports, the scaly people fly! He, dreadful monster! sucks in seas, and spouts 'em, at the sky! On thee, obedient, all thy creatures wait: And, in due season, all, by thee, are fed, Thy single bounty does their bliss create; They gather, what thy op'ning hand has spread: If thou but hid'st thy face, they fall away: Thou tak'st their breath, and they decay; At once, return to unform'd dust, and old paternal clay. Again! thou dost but speak thy potent will! And life, rekindling, glows within 'em, still! Forever, shall thy glorious power endure! The pillars of thy majesty stand steadfastly, and sure! Approach'd by thee, the conscious mountains smoke; And earth, dissolv'd, flows loose, beneath thy stroke! To his Muse. Thy country! blast it, if it once disdains, To prop thy virtues, or reward thy pains! If there I prosper, here was only born, That claims my duty! this deserves my scorn! O muse! 'tis mean to stoop to helpless moan! Try, if no clime is gentler, than thy own! Offer, on distant shores, a faithful hand, In vain, not useless, in thy mother land! When fortune frowns, and care's black harvest springs, A change of place, a change of prospect brings! Far off, thy reason's force, uncurb'd, may reign; But even the prophets preach'd at home in vain. Yet, hold! and e'er it quite determin'd grows, Let me some sudden starts of hope disclose: E'er, widely wand'ring, led by false distrust, From my wing'd feet, I shake their native dust! Perhaps, my doubt clouds some domestic ray: And hides a prospect, bordering on my way! Tho' men of title seem exempt from thought, And pride's assistance is but vainly sought: Tho' truth, oft try'd, this known advice imparts, That noble blood may warm ignoble hearts! Hid in a cloud of pomp, which hems the throne, There may be greatness, to my hopes unknown! Howe'er unsought, howe'er unseen, by me, There may some soul-distinguish'd nature be! Some gen'rous breast, whose mind, divinely warm, Has taught him, how uncourted favours charm! If such there be, so rich, so strong, a mind! And thou, blest muse, shall his bright bosom find! Whisper, in gentle notes, thy master's pray'r: And, in soft accents, this sad truth declare. There lives, O, brightest gem, of honour's crown! Thou angel-acted theme of just renown! There lives, who, skill'd, in Fortune's wanton sports, Hopes, with such faintness, for regard from courts, That, tho' not blind to worth, which all men see! He sends me, half-despairing, even to thee! No gain-polluted aim inspires his views! He seeks not office, nor reward pursues! More nobly fir'd, his thoughts high schemes design, To stretch dominion, and make empire shine! Oh! were his wishes blest! and thy kind ear Wou'd, once, impartial, his conceptions hear! Th' important moment might resolves produce, And cloath ideas, with substantial use! Stop there, O muse! 'twere needless more to say! And, with unwilling slowness, glide away: If, mov'd, he calls thee back, regardful, go! If not, return, ungriev'd: all vain complaint is low. The Tears of the Muses: A Poem. Germanicus, for love, and empire, born, At once to govern kingdoms, and adorn; Too good for greatness, but that kings can bless, Too firm for fear, but of his friend's distress: Fore-temp'ring pow'r by reason's generous plan, To task the monarch, meditates the man. In a town grove, whence dryads noise exclude, And hush loud streets, to sylvan solitude, Veil'd by a verdant skreen's incircling shade, Whose angly sides eight arching lights pervade, Friend to mankind, their pensive fav'rite stood; Revolving previous plans of purpos'd good. Soft, to his sight, a female suppliant press'd, In all the speaking marks of mis'ry dress'd: Down-look'd, relax'd of mien, oft bending, low; Now stopping short, now re-advancing, slow: Pardon, she cry'd, th' intruding sighs of grief; Hope is the friendless wretche's last relief. GERMANICUS, who, when distress draws nigh, Catches quick sorrow, from the suff'rer's eye, With gentle waft invites her back'ning fears, And smiles the warmth of pity on her tears. Her, while advancing, heedful he survey'd, Chance stretch'd his eye to the remoter shade: Where, dimly obvious, from the bord'ring wood, Dark'ning the arches, eight new phantoms stood; All, like the first, thin forms of shiv'ring woe, Wept all—in dumb, sad, solemn, circl'y show! Think, cry'd th' approacher, prostrate at his feet, How sharp is insult! and relief how sweet! Pity a wretched sisterhood of tears: Nine friendless mourners, whom no comfort chears. All arts were ours, that polish'd life cou'd gain: But arts, and polish'd life, were ours in vain. See! what reward wish'd knowledge cou'd impart! Where fool is fashion, ignorance is art. Urg'd by derision, and escaping hate, We, sad, slow, exiles, seek some gentler fate. To the bleak north's new-rising coasts we go; Less cold than these, amidst eternal snow. Glory's gay beams, to whose felt warmth we run, More than supply the absence of their sun. There, mourning merit cannot miss relief; Where watchful pow'r supplants prevented grief. Fam'd for munificence, thy princely hand Singly absolves an unbestowing land. Ah! save the friendless—help the wrong'd away: Too poor to go, yet too un-lov'd to stay! Pay but wish'd passage from this cruel shore: And never, never, will we trust it more. Scarce had th' imploring accents voic'd her pray'r, When the known sounds and recollected air, Through the false semblance, natively convey'd, To the charm'd prince, a speaking muse, betray'd. Round, while, uncrediting the storied woe, His curious eyes discov'ring glances throw. Th' examin'd umbrage, as he turn'd, reveal'd Each muse, that ev'ry distant arch conceal'd. Waiting impatient, for the finish'd tale, Quit your vain hope, he cry'd, by want's thin veil Unhid, to 'scape the rev'rence of my zeal, Who all your power, thro' all your changes, feel. Joyful, he snatch'd th' implorer from the ground, Then, turning graceful, bow'd progressive, round; Press'd their joint access undisguis'd and gay; And shone, receptive of each effluent ray. Seated, and circled by the beamy train, Their shapes, resuming, and themselves again, Tell me, said he—ye soul-inspiring nine! Ye living fires, that give the great, to shine, Who, quick'ning regal courage into flame, Guide it, by justice, to immortal fame! Why wou'd ye leave a land distinguish'd, long, For love of valour, and for hate of wrong? Where freedom unrestrain'd her empire holds, And legal monarchy new bloom unfolds? He paus'd—and Clio answering, thus began, Perish, pale Malice!—It oblit'rates man. Where envy blasts, the muse inspires in vain: No human culture, there, extends its reign. Lost in malignity by civil hate, Virtues, that clash with virtues, curse a state. Stifled in faction, arts unfriended sink: Or, pigmy'd into partial flatt'ry shrink. Hist'ry must blush, the wiles of spleen to pen, And grace the bloodless broils of angry men. Smother'd in self, there breathes no public soul, Where sep'rate strugglings gen'ral strength controul; There, Policy's old gen'rous straitness bends; And shifting medium crawls to sidelong ends. There, fraud triumphant tempts the just to fall: And every one man's gain is loss, to all. There, love, internal, checking sighs that roam, Begins, and ends, all charity,—at home. Each pray'r appropriates one man's modest aim: And humbly trusts to God the common claim. Crush'd by contempt of praise, exertion dies: And public spirit, laugh'd at, shuns to rise. Thither when hope misleads th' historic muse, Swift let her seek some scene of nobler views. Where guileless pow'r no praise to craft ascribes, Where Courage scorns deceit, and duty—bribes. Where nervous meaning dares, directly, speak: And crooked windings teach no truth to sneak. 'Tis found—for, see!—the icy pole dissolves! Honour's new warmth with sunny force evolves! There, glows event! there, more than Roman arms Clash their prophetic thunder's fear'd alarms! There, the puls'd public beats, in ev'ry vein: Strong, to one purpose, lifts with equal strain. No vile pretension, there, at titles aims: No Pride-swoln lumber lazy lordship shames. There, shines the sword, in honour's guarded track, No knighthood blushes, on a miser's back. No bought emblaz'nings, eminence efface, No dirty dignity sublimes disgrace. There, Heroes multiply; and labouring fame Grows busy,—to record each sparkling name. She ceased—the prince his patriot eyes withdrew, Weigh'd the long charge, and wish'd it, half, untrue. Sigh'd at the waste domestic discord made: And mourn'd unfriended arts, by spleen betray'd. Then view'd the sisters, reprepar'd to hear: While Erato, soft sighing, charm'd his ear. Lur'd, said the am'rous muse, from realms above, Pleas'd, I descended on this land of love; Look'd and approv'd: and form'd aërial schemes, Of heart-felt tyes, and hope's elusive dreams; Vainly propos'd—each sex by each to mend; And smooth the rugged paths of life, with friend. Snatch'd at one sweet example, new to fame, Urg'd its dear pow'r, th' unhappier to reclaim: Misguided millions hail'd th' acknowledg'd charms; And lov'd perfection, when it bless'd thy arms. But ah! too lost a length themselves were gone! They worship'd, and confess'd:—but still sinn'd on. Yet I, vain hoper! still new helps apply: And, ever failing, wou'd forever try. To slighted beauty wou'd new powers impart: And stretch the aided empire of the heart. Teach man, that woman's strength in softness lies: Teach woman, why the modest charm the wise. Useless to either, I from both, remove. Money's th' inspiring muse of modish love! O'er truth and passion, avarice prevails, All vows are venal, and all sighs are sales. Int'rest and vanity, and self, disarm Mutual esteem, till neither sex can charm. Then, blanc unnat'ral whims pervert desire: Attraction failing, they exchange attire. Then, man's lac'd lightness apes the lady's air: And bluff, big, boldness, masculates the fair. With changing sexes, love's lost motives change, From wish to wish the short-liv'd passions range. Recorded constancy becomes romance: And, among millions, two may love—by chance! Why should I, then, supporting present scorn, Stretch my too patient hope, to times unborn? When, to the North, where nature shines unstain'd, Confiding sexes love, with faith unfeign'd, Their native beauties, in no clime excell'd, To rising force by conscious worth impell'd; While thro' the sparkling eye taught spirit breaks, And the felt lustre of their fame partakes. The lover prince unwillingly believ'd Faults, which his nobler nature scarce conceiv'd. Touch'd for the honour of the human heart, His own glow'd painful, with ideal smart. When loftier accents from Urania broke, And snatch'd his list'ning soul, while science spoke. From heav'n's unsounded depth, she cry'd, I stole Angelic fire, and form'd a Newton's soul. Taught him the secret walks of God to tread; And 'twixt the starry worlds his spirit led: All Æther op'ning to a mortal's eyes, Till earth sent colonies, and held the Skies! What King, for this magnificently just, Bless'd him in life, or dignified his dust? What voted honours mark the aspirer's race? What thinking statues emulate his face? He, who immortaliz'd his country's name, Beyond ten thousand conqu'rors bounded fame, He, who, to lift mankind, new heav'ns display'd, And every human breather nobler made, Did he to public fame all nature raise? And is he poorly left to private praise! In such a land, ah! what can arts expect? What claim has hopeless science, but neglect? O! fate of wint'ry worth, by climate cross'd! Budding untimely, to be nip'd in frost! Newton has multiplied the suns!—yet pours In vain, the light of all their orbs, on ours. When will th' incurious courts, for which, he found New worlds, find will to trace an old one round? What promis'd pension ships th' unshaken soul, To dare discov'ry, and ungloom the pole? What coasting keel, indenting southern strands, Starts the long shores of cloud-benighted lands? No annual bounty, persevering, kind, Draws the dark veil, that covers half mankind. What regal influ'nce, easing learning's birth? Now, adds new stars to heav'n? or arts, to earth? Who sows munificence, to root up sloth, And call forth harvests, of eternal growth? Hail, to the land, where war makes science room! Where realms from desarts rise! and ruins bloom! Where conquest, spreading to embrace distress, Lets loose ambition, not to waste, but bless! There, pow'r inverts destruction, into birth; And the prolific sword empeoples earth! There, desolation, fruitful in decay, Fades, into opulence, and strengthens sway. There, ports (un-native) indrawn seas confine: And climbing streams o'er channel'd mountains shine. There, public splendor swallows private pride, And claims, which all men share in, all men, guide, There art, rewarded, strains excited skill; Till dazling wonders wid'ning empire fill. The fierce free Tartar sees the Tartar taught; Grins, at advancing rule, and pants for thought. Then, in long link, new nations forward draw: And the drain'd wilds of nature crowd to law. Hail, promis'd land!—All, now, that seems severe, Is—that, removing hence, we leave You here. Urania stopp'd and bow'd.—The prince, whose heart Inly confess'd the pow'r of cherish'd art, Nobly approving praise, so justly warm; Smil'd, conscious of his inborn right to charm. Next, rose Terpsichore,—melodious muse! Soft, her first accents, like descending dews: Sweet, and slow swelling, till in livelier sound, Gay, to the ravish'd ear, quick transports bound. Tim'd to the tuneful voice, each trembling tree Strain'd its tugg'd roots, and labour'd to be free. Warm'd thro' the wak'ning stone, the sculptur'd ear Of every starting statue seem'd to hear. Air catch'd, and length'ning back the mazy notes, Curls, while the undulating music floats. Earth list'ning to inhale harmonious pain, Sigh'd it, in soft vibration, back again. Pardon a mourning muse, that leaves, with tears, The land, that lov'd Germanicus endears. But, ah! what toils, what anguish, shalt thou bear! What endless labour must o'erload thy care! Ere thy last views a taste, like thine, inspire, And sparkling kingdoms catch thy manly fire! Near opera's fribling fugues, what muse can stay? Where wordless warblings winnow thought, away! Music, when purpose points her not the road, Charms, to betray, and softens, to corrode. Empty of sense, the soul-seducing art Thrills a slow poison to the sick'ning heart. Soft sinks idea, dissolute in ease, And all life's feeble lesson is, to please. Spirit, and taste, and generous toil, take flight: And lazy love, and indolent delight, And low luxurious weariness of pain, Lull the lost mind,—and all its powers are vain. Hence, to the realms of fame, ye muses, fly. There, to the drum's big beat, the heart leaps high. There, sighing flutes but temp'ring martial heat, Teach distant pity and revenge to meet. The manly pipe, there, scorns th' expanded shakes, That wind wav'd nothings, till attention akes. There now, concurring keys and chords increase The heart's soft social tyes, and cherish peace. Then, trumpets, answ'ring trumpets, shrill, and far, Swell to the sounding wind th' inspiring war. There, the rous'd soul, in exercise, grows strong: Nor pools to puddly foulness, stopp'd, too long. Strength'ning and strengthned, by the poet's fire, There, music's meaning voice exalts desire. There, harmony not drowns, but quickens, thought; And fools, unfeeling words, by notes are caught. Soft sigh'd the prince, for suff'ring music, pain'd, And Polyhymnia, rising warm, complain'd. Deign to be told, impartial, gen'rous, wise! Why fruitless eloquence indignant flies. Gall'd at lost time, in cases vainly clear'd, At truths untouching, and at sounds, unheard; Blushing, while Oratory's lab'ring strains, On præ-decision, waste derided pains; And flourish'd periods, to no purpose fine, Like suns in desarts, without notice, shine, Hating grave insult, I disdain to stay, Where talk but trifles, and where tropes but play. If serious rhet'ric sweats, where sneering mutes Hast'ning the hurried question, crop disputes; If law sells argument, yet forms must reign, And, custom pleading, equity is vain; If the dark pulpit's short mysterious art Lifts faith to heav'n; and damns the moral heart; Bear me, dishonour'd God! to some plain state, Where truth, in spite of aye and no, is weight. Where pleas of right a reas'ning bench persuade, And justice scorns in precedent to trade. Where no bold blasphemy wou'd faith enslave: But, humble, honest, doubting, works can save. Euterpe, watchful of her sister's close, Snatch'd her sunk cadence, and impatient rose. Pleasure, she cry'd, is mine; mine, the gay skill, To paint the fancy, and adorn the will. But where dry avarice has taste betray'd, Pleasure is robbery, in masquerade. Contending sexes push one common aim: And youth, and wit, and beauty, meet, to game! At cards to conquer, or at dice to sweep, Is all the humble joy, the polish'd reap! Or, if, aspiring to robuster praise, Some livelier genius, warmth more active sways, Then, frock'd in groomy sleekness, tight, and smart, The pert, capp'd, racer, dares the jockeys art, At stake and plate, his skill profoundly shewn, He, from his horse's worth, presumes his own. Or, nobly stung by John the coachman's claim, Climbing th' advent'rous box, disputes his fame! Scatt'ring malignant dust, cracks voice and thong, Glows, for a livery's right, and burns along! Proudly display'd, looks back, and shouts to find Poor conscious John, less glorious, hang behind. Not so, th' Olympian rivals charm'd, of old, When fiery youths in whirling chariots roll'd! Then, the watch'd signal bad the rank disjoin; And rushing wheels dissolv'd the breaking line: Strain'd to th' expanded whip's impulsive sound, Light leap'd th' exulting axles o'er the ground: 'Twixt crowding nations, partial, panting, gay, The prais'd plum'd hero skim'd the less'ning way, The smoaking steeds obey'd the watchful rein, And winding warlike, swept the shouting plain. Now, graceful rais'd, now pendent in career, High, and far-glitt'ring, shone the charioteer; Firm in his seat, superior in his mien, Flew o'er the course, and flam'd along the green: Martial in gesture, eminent in grace, His birth and grandeur light'ning from his face. Or, if to sweeter contest match'd he mov'd, And, in some ball, led the kind hand he lov'd, The modest fair, slow thro' the mazy dance, Swam to the love-sick soul, in soft advance. No light coarse frisking kick'd off woman's air: No strong, stretch'd, limb, out-trod attraction, there, Decent their pleasures, and discreetly weigh'd; Active the youth, and delicate the maid. Honour, by elegance, its right maintain'd: And, thought correcting rapture, prudence reign'd. Mournful Melpomene, with tragic frown, Spoke next: and thus deplor'd a tasteless town. Why strove the scenic muse to shine, in vain, Where wit is levity, and art is gain? Where law's blind hope wou'd curb corruption's rage, Yet, left undue contempt to taint the stage? Hence, Theatres, neglected into shame, Catching at concourse, purity disclaim. By pow'r deserted, make their humbler court To rake, and rancour, or to fool and sport. Piqu'd to reprizal, unconfed'rate wit, Noting the popular, evades the fit. Then, the play plots on state-craft, laughs at truth: Misguides allegiance, or unsinews youth. Thither crouds faction, to be taught complaint: Where pow'r, the martyr, might have reign'd, the saint. There, wisdom bleeds, by pleasure's feath'ry dart: And love's loose hand unstrings the slacken'd heart. There, discontent, first, tries her tim'rous force; Hints, and finds help, and dares her dang'rous course. There, froth, farce, flatt'ry, chance, sedition, rule: And virtue scarce finds place, in virtue's school! Farewell, forsaken stage—When courts refuse To urge wit's wand'ring rein, she shames a muse. Hail! from afar—thou, fate-foretelling light! Beaming prognostic, through the eye of night! Kindling a hundred realms, the' enliv'ning flame Wings the wak'd energy of courted fame. There, empire flashing into glory's blaze, Conscious intention blushes not at praise. There spurring virtue, wit has leave to mean: And pow'r exciting passion, prompts the scene. So must it be, ere tragic fire is felt! But, where grave thoughts are marks, for fools to pelt, Where tir'd illit'rate viewless yawning pride Must hear, unlist'ning, and, untaught, decide, There, let lost sentiment mispoint no beam; To hope, were blindness: and to wish a dream! Up leap'd Thalia, glowing red with rage, Fir'd and indignant at a farceful age. Shall Comedy's insulted muse, she cry'd, Hold hoops, to tumblers!— She paus'd,—unable to proceed;—sigh'd strong: Repell'd the big disdain—and trac'd her wrong. Shall Comedy, for sworded harlequin, Split lathes? and arm him, for the mimic scene! While he, proud impotence! with modish strut, Cocks bluff, diffusive of his wooden cut! Must she swing Gypsies o'er the winnow'd pit, Mounting posteriors, in defect of wit! Or clap some human whirlwind's blust'ring rage, That o'er twelve heads descending, shakes the stage! Stare, while th' unmanly reptile's wriggling twist Threads the stav'd ladder, and descends, unhiss'd? Or, for the rope-aspirer's jirkful tread, Shall she poize right their emblematic lead? No—Let implor'd expulsion wing me thence! Far let me fly, to some fair seat of sense: Where life's stol'n humour glows with mirthful grace, And comic picture copies nature's face: Where imag'd passion, dear to the polite, Leaves low buffoon'ry to the rabble's right. Tir'd, yet untask'd, let me no longer wait, Laughing unheeded—at the laughing great: While, with the roar of boys, to tricks they run, Which mobs shou'd shout at, and the wise shou'd shun. Gravely, good souls! reserving solid scorn, For thoughts, to feel whose force, themselves were born. Warm'd in wit's cause, lamenting genius lost, Nor tasting ecstasy, at judgment's cost, List'ning Germanicus, with pensive grace, Revolv'd wish'd soft'nings, for a pitied race: When, like a trumpet pouring music's flood, Speaking Calliope thrill'd thro' his blood. There was a prince! ah! bid me add, ere long, There is—impulsive of the epic song. Flame, of imperial prominence, he shin'd: Terror, at once, and charm, of humankind! All the soft praise of social life his due: All the rais'd pow'rs, of arms, and arts, he knew: Fearless, impell'd his father's fortune on: And, in youth's dawn, a dazzling victor shone! In force resistless, yet undaring wrong: Honest, in vengeance! and in pity, strong! Without, dwelt war, in all her thund'ring din: While peace in all her stillness, wept, within. Form'd for a lover, for a thinker taught; Bloodless reflective eminence, he sought: Born to be greatest, chose but to be best: But heav'n, that knew his use, forbad his rest: Then, from the calms of conqu'ring thought, he rose, Glow'd in tempestuous war, and scorn'd repose. Uncrown'd, gave crowns, at will, their thorns untry'd; And more than reigning, without reigning died. Such, though the land I leave cou'd shew me still, Calm seasons call not for a Pilot's skill. Peace is the blessing, commerce loves to chuse; But war, and glory, task the epic muse. Farewel, sure subject of my future song! When, rising shameful at a people's wrong, In times yet distant, thy rememb'ring hand Lets loose correction at some foreign land. Then, loud as thy applause, reclaim us, all: And every muse of nine shall wait thy call. Speaking she rose: and, with her, rising slow, Her eight sad sisters, sighing, turn'd to go. Lively upstarting from his shadow'd seat, Stay, cry'd the prince, alarm'd,—suspend retreat. Just though your anger, yet revenge forbear: Lest, taught by muses, man forgets to spare. Too soon, degen'rate nature warps awry, The bad to copy, and the good to fly. Have you beheld wit's stream discolour'd glide, And pour'd lost azure on th' unconscious tide? Think the blame yours, who heav'n's best tincture bring, To stain the current, yet neglect the spring! Wou'd you, at once, Cœrulean depth renew? And, gayly bright'ning, flush th' improvement, through? High, at the source, th' infusive tinge bestow: And ev'ry downward drop shall tinctur'd flow. But, while, a vagrant, inspiration strays, And, here and there, unlicens'd pow'r displays, Though sep'rate, individual strollers share Some uncollective scatt'rings, of your care; This way, and that, though some faint hint of light Gleams, like a meteor, and shrinks back in night, Or, mingling beams, to form some deathless blaze, Once in an age, you, Popes, or Thomsons, raise: All the lost labour serves but to express, How wide our wants! how thinly we possess! Till the day breaks, expect no gen'ral glow: For, the sky darken'd, keeps all dark, below. Here, for wit's fountain, dream not of a court, False and injurious, slight th' unweigh'd report. Meant, for a clime, where thrones appropriate pow'r, And one man's passions all mens rights devour. But, in free states, where liberty may chuse, Taste knows no monarch, and obeys no muse. Senates their muses; property their aim: Their boast but safety—and their play-thing, fame. No—wou'd your willing culture waste no toil? Wou'd your bays thrive, in a reluctant soil? Ductile of form, and changing shapes at will, Assume new sex, new names, new views, new skill. Safe, in sage politics, conceal your wit: Then, by my bounty, qualify'd to sit, Nine Cornish boroughs might assign you place, Where, mix'd unthought-of, you may shun disgrace. There, breathing unsuspected influence, lurk, Till patient progress crowns your arduous work. Thence, shall descending radiance taste convey: And willing kingdoms make the muses way. Till, time slow fav'ring, you may quit disguise, And wear wit, plain, among th'unlaughing wise. Pausing, he smil'd humanity, so kind, That ev'ry muse was touch'd, and chang'd her mind: All bow'd consent, to his grave purpose wrought; And, thus, Urania voic'd her sister's thought. Born to a people's hearts, their Darling, shine! Let ev'ry wish, and hope, and joy, be thine! Mov'd by the magic mercy of thy view, We feel good counsel, and embrace it too. One sole condition grant, and we obey: No dang'rous notice must detect our stay! Hid in thy grove, each menial muse shall claim Domestic shelter from reproach and shame: Till, by thy scheme, their yet unrival'd friend! Their influ'ence widens, and their suff'rings end. Then, shewn the world, and privileg'd to please, And, gath'ring face and fashion, by degrees, Seen at assemblies, belles may jokes forbear: Nor, shocking modest strangers, turn and stare! Thus, in his shade, from public pain exempt, Sleeping, the visionary poet dreamt. Then wak'd; and found his sparkling Prince was there: But ev'ry empty muse was lost in air. The Creation. A Paraphrase upon the first Chapter of Genesis. [I.] In the beginning, the Almighty God! Sending out his loud decree, Begot existence, and bid being be! Creation! first-born child of un-nam'd night, Swell'd slowly, upward, at his pow'rful beck: Aloft, he wav'd his threat'ning rod, And, strait, resistance fled the aweful check! And trembled, downward, from his dreadful nod! Then, out of chaos, streak'd with sudden light, Up roll'd the face of form, wrapt round with night, And, from the curling clouds, march'd out, magnificent, and bright. Loose earth, at first, was rude, and shapeless, made, And cover'd thick, with still, and empty shade; For darkness, brooding o'er the deep, had motion overlaid! Out went the spirit, o'er the lifeless waste, And breath'd, in breezy gales, God's high command: Let there be light, said he; and e'er the word was past, Pale, quiv'ring beams shot thick, on every hand: And gath'ring into lustre, devious, flew, Ready to act, but ignorant what to do. The spirit swift collected all, and rang'd em, on one side, And drove the sever'd darkness on a heap, Curling black with wheely sweep, In piles, immensely horrible, and steep: Then, passing slow, between, their borders to divide; Henceforth, be this bright fluid, day, he cry'd, And night this dusky mount, on my left side: So saying, pleas'd with his own work, he shot himself away, And morning, thus, and evening, join'd, made up the first great day. II. The hand of God, again, was stretch'd o'er all: Ascend, he cry'd, ye thin, and subtile train, That, lightest, in the mingled mass, remain. The floaty atoms started, at his call, And hasted to him all; Whose voice was never heard in vain. High, from the grosser heap, they steam'd away: A nimble host of springy bodies, curl'd, In various forms, and struggling every way, To be at ease, and fly unfurl'd; But each, obstructive to the other's care, Together twisted wide they spread, a liquid field of air! Here, cry'd the mighty Former, draw a line, All above this, be mine! Heaven shall be here, and, here, my throne shall shine! Hither, ye thinnest, purest, atoms rise, Possess, and fill my topmost skies! You second ranks, rest where you are, And call your fluid force the Atmosphere: But you, more heavy climbers! backward fall, Keep you the humblest post of all: Condens'd to closer substance, roll below, And, murm'ring hoarse, in wat'ry vastness flow. All, widely differing, hear alike, and equally obey, And so found end, the second formful day. III. Let all these currents, which, divided, run, Unite, says God, and gather into One! At once, with hollow roar, the back'ning flood, Unveil'd the reeking earth, and shrunk away: 'Twas then the third astonish'd day, Disclos'd a swelling globe of naked mud, A lifeless bulk, which all unactive lay: And saw the channel'd Ocean, round it, play! Warm, breath'd prolific spirit o'er the face Of each new dreary space; Th' impregnate glebe, grown conscious of her worth, Conceiv'd at once, at once brought forth. With mineral pangs, her stiff'ning bowels groan, Her heaving mountains harden into stone. The muddy surface brightens into green: Sturdy shrubs are, this way, seen; Stemless herbs rise, there, between. The opening rose, by nature gay, Blushes at the kiss of day! Pale, hard by, the lilly blows, Envious of the ruddy rose; And, pining at her sicklier white, Hangs her head, to shun the sight. Each verdant vale embroider'd beauty fills; And shooting forests crown the waving hills. Carpets of grass o'erspread th' extended plains; And, here and there, for ornament, an uncloath'd rock remains! IV. Well-pleas'd, the Maker saw his work succeed: 'Tis wond'rous fair, he said! these charms below, With sparkling beauty seem to plead, That heaven shou'd pay 'em back some show. Then, let there be two glorious lights: Let one inspire the days, and one adorn the nights. The word was God's! 'twas said, and done! Out-blaz'd, at once, the glorious sun! All heaven, and earth, strait, catch'd the quickning fire; And melted into warm, and new desire. The sea, enamour'd with his beams, Smil'd, upward, from a thousand streams; And, longing to approach him nigher, Dissolv'd, in exhalations, to aspire! Wide, this new torch of heaven, the world adorns; The crescent moon, too, show'd her silver horns: But, with a paler lustre shin'd: For she, distasteful, that she ow'd her light To a proud rival's envied sight, At her inferior fate, repin'd, And, as he rose, declin'd! God saw her grief, and bent to ease her pain, And ornament her shadowy reign, Struck out a myriad of illustrious sparks, The Gems of heav'n, her starry marks! And, e'er the bashful Planet cou'd complain, Bid her light up the sun-left world, with her night-twinkling train. V. The fifth day dawn'd; and, thus, God's voice was heard, Why shou'd this world of waters steril flow? By inborn offspring, let her wastes be chear'd. Bring forth, O sea! and fill the depths, below: Loud ocean, hush'd to stillness, and afraid To let one wave the shore invade, Wonder'd, yet, to feel, within, A kind of moving war begin! Fermenting vigour stirr'd the wat'ry heap, Liquid life began to creep, And half-form'd monsters flounder'd, thro' the deep. Panting sensation, by degrees, spread wide; Fishes, swift-shooting, from the bottom, glide, To stem, in scaly shoals, the topmost tide. The shell-drest tribe, of growth, and motion, slow, Crawl, humbly, on the strands, below: Warm, and gay, the nimbler kind Upward roll, the top to find, And, leaping, cool their livers, in the wind. In the mid-way, the plunging whale plays round, Wanton in life, he whirls, with antic bounds, And, sometimes, to the surface mounts, and, sometimes, sweeps the ground; The boiling deep about him foams, and, with his sport, resounds. Thence, too, the feather'd nation, flutt'ring, rise, Clouds of sun-obscuring size! And, every bird, as from the wave he springs, And tries his new-form'd throat, and sings, Shakes the moisture from his wings; Then, drawn by instinct, upward flies, And tow'rs, ambitious, to the tempting skies. Be fruitful, all, God said, and multiply, And fill the seas, and fill the sky: Throughout the ocean, O, ye Fish! abound: And let your various kinds, O Fowl! o'er all the earth be found. VI. Now, air was peopled, and the roomy seas! And nesting inmates fill'd the branchy trees! Thou, earth, said God, shalt, yet once more, conceive, E'er our mighty task we leave: Earth, trembling from her center, heard the sound, And felt, thro' all her chasms, inspiring heat! Warm germination heav'd th' enliv'ning ground, And, from the forest's close, and dark retreat, Lynxes, and Tygers, on a sudden, bound. From the silent, mountain cave, Glaring round, the lion stalks! And wond'ring, frowns, in fierceness grave, To meet the clumsy Camel, in his walks! The sprightly horse neighs, from the rugged hill, And, shooting downward, thunders o'er the plain; Bounding along, strikes out his heels at will, Till, in his way, encount'ring there, Rais'd, on his hinder paws, a grinning Bear, Roughly fix'd, in stupid stare, Snorting, he starts, and gallops back, again! From the moist fen, th' unfinish'd Frog Croaks faintly, yet but half-way freed; And, struggling with his muddy clog, Drags out his limber legs, and skips along the mead! From the bush, the speckled Snake, With high-rais'd head, astonish'd, glides; Hissing, he journeys on, from brake to brake, Proud of the curly folds, whereon he slides! From the high precipice, the bearded Goat Looks down, with gravity, on distant flocks: The Wolf discerns him, and, with barking throat, Springs upward, at him, and assaults the rocks! In every plain, on every hill, The busy world is stirr'd throughout: And, labouring with its maker's will, In breathing mists, a swarm of life breaks out! VII. High, on a mount of Eden's happy shore, Thoughtful, at last, the great Creator stood: I find, says he, there wants one labour more, And, then, the work is good! And, be it, so, e'er yet I give it o'er: One shall be form'd, to rule the millions, form'd before! He said; and wav'd, on high, his aweful hand, Strait, from hot Arabia's sand, And Scythia's wild, and frozen land, A gathering whirlwind toward him blew; Sweeping, from East to West, from pole to pole, Swifter, than thought, the circling eddies roll; And a long train of each land's dust, in clouds, together drew. Th' approaching atoms their Creator knew, And guess'd his mighty meaning, too; And, knitting into close embrace, a human shape they grew! God touch'd the light, and unconnected frame, And breath'd the breath of life throughout. A sudden flash of spirit, thro' it, ran! At once, the dry conjunction catch'd the flame, And kindled into man. The jointed dust look'd wild about, and living soul became; He saw his God, and prostrate fell, oppress'd with virtuous shame. VIII. Hear me, thou captain of my creatures! thou, Whose nobler form, in my own image, made, Forbids thee, any where, to bow, But to my glory, in these works, display'd, I, thy great Maker, must be well obey'd: All else shall thy commands fulfil, Only subject to thy will: Look round those wide-extended plains, below, Whate'er thou see'st, is all thy own! Yon distant mountains, topt with snow, Swell'd to that height, for thee, alone! For thee, yon winding rivers flow; Fill'd, within, by finny shoals! There's not a bird of heaven, which shall not know, And stoop to thy controuls. For thee, yon wind-shook forests grow; And all these lovely flowers, Enamel earth, and scent the breezy showers, Which give 'em strength to rise, and paint the leafy bowers. The fruits, of various hew, are also thine; For thee, yon rip'ning clusters shine: The loaded stems, which bear 'em, bending stand, But to invite thy hand. But, have a care, O Son of dust! thus rais'd, That I am duly prais'd: Remember, grateful, by whose pow'r thou art, And, in the flowing fullness of thy joy, Be mindful, he, who made thee, can destroy, And curb the haughty swellings of thy heart. CAMILLUS: A Poem. Humbly inscrib'd to the Right Honourable Charles Earl of Peterborough and Monmouth. Writ, in the Year 1707. When injur'd Heroes suffer in their fame, Justice, unsummon'd, shou'd their wrongs proclaim: But Phæbus' Sons shou'd raise resentment higher, And light up vengeance, with poetic fire. For, where injustice clouds a noble name, The Patron's scandal is the Poet's shame. Permit, Great Sir, my humble muse to raise A private monument, of public praise: Unbend your mighty soul, and stoop to fame, Whose voice shall sound, to heaven, your glorious name, Minds, that are great, like yours, disdain applause, Their inborn virtue gives their reason laws: Above the reach of malice, blest, they live, Proud to be envy'd, and, like heaven, forgive. What depth of line must my rais'd fancy find, To sound th' unfathom'd ocean of thy mind! Or, thro' the lab'rynth of thy wonders wind! How dares my untry'd pen attempt a verse, Worthy thy God-like actions to rehearse? How dares my flutt'ring muse invade that sky, Where Virgil, eagle-wing'd, wou'd fail, to fly! Dark, in my breast, tumultuous terrors roll, And rising passions shake my lab'ring soul: Encount'ring reasons, thro' my judgment, shine, Some urge, and some forbid, the vast design: Here, justice summons—there, my youth denies; Duty, to this, to that, my will replies. Resolv'd, at last, your safe return to greet, I throw my worthless numbers, at your feet; Assur'd, the generous goodness of your eye, Will see my zeal, and pass my errors by. But, if my feeble genius chance to fail, Nor ardent pray'rs can, with the nine, prevail; Think, Sir, how various your great acts appear! There, war, and glory—wit, and honour, here: One glitt'ring moment spreads your wond'rous fame, Battles, and bloodshed, celebrate your name! Now, the great hero, in a purple flood, Plunges, thro' stormy seas of hostile blood. Now, strides, with skilful courage, from afar, To stop some gap, of unsuccessful war: Another moment, smoothly, gilds his face, With lovely sweetness, and delightful grace: Calmly, he tunes his mind, to softer sports, And lives the matchless Paragon of courts. NO wonder then, if my presumptuous eye, Viewing thy Sun of excellence, too nigh, Dazzled with light, is forc'd to look awry! A traveller, who, thus, without a guide, O'er some unmeasur'd tract, attempts to ride; Where thousand paths, of equal breadth, appear, And each fair course seems safe, alike, to steer, May, spite of strictest caution, lose his way, And, scarce, be justly said, to go astray. In peace, the fam'd Hispania, long, had slept, And free possession of her Indies kept: Made poor, by plenty, dull content she knew; Her strength declining, as her riches grew: Till, forc'd to valour, she begins too late, And climbs, unwilling, but to pull down fate. Their second Charles resign'd his princely breath, And swift-wing'd fame proclaim'd th' expected death: Sudden, the trumpet echoes, from afar, And friendly nations rise to furious war: The hardy veterans their arms prepare, And waving banners fan the heated air: The sprightly steeds, with lofty bounds, advance, And curb'd, by skillful riders, proudly prance: A wild confusion, o'er the globe, is hurl'd, And warlike earthquakes shake the christian world. The Austrian prince, heir, in affirm'd descent, To grasp the crown, his strong endeavours bent: Bourbon oppos'd, and, in the vacant throne, Wou'd place a royal offspring of his own. Doubtful the right—but pow'r, which all obey, Appear'd, to justify the second's sway: The arms of France allure the voice of Spain, And Anjou seated, will his post maintain. Sighing, the young prevented Austrian stands, And lifts, to gracious heaven, his eyes, and hands: Implores swift justice, to an injur'd man; And heaven directs his prayers to heaven's vicegerent, Anne. Thither, they fly, whom pow'rful wrongs oppress, And find a certain shelter from distress: By her, the proud aspirer, daily, bleeds, And biass'd monarchs wait her dreaded deeds, Aw'd, tho' displeas'd, to her decrees they stand, And own the fate of Europe, in her hand. Thither, with tow'ring hopes, and longing eyes, The young, excluded monarch, swiftly, flies: Whispers, in Anna's ear, his weighty grief, And, from her pitying soul, extracts relief. At her command, th' intrepid Britons fly, Exert their inborn worth, and proudly die: Pleas'd with their fate, they dearly sell their breath, And smile, amidst the raging pangs of death. A chosen band of these, who all things dare, For distant war, their mighty souls prepare: Thro' every ear, their glorious cause they ring, To curb proud France, and right an injur'd King. O'er these, a Chief, by art, and nature, grac'd, Renown'd in war, and policy, was plac'd: Beyond mankind, his judgement cou'd discern, And much improve what others could not learn: He ow'd no virtue, to a dread of shame, No seeming honesty, to promis'd fame: On its own base, in him, true honour stood, Wash'd, by a generous tide of noble blood. Him the great Anna chose—Camillus go, Revenge my brother, on his haughty foe: Guard him to Spain,—there, let my will be known, And seat the monarch, in his ravish'd throne. The valiant chief, without ambition, brave, Humbly receiv'd the weighty charge, she gave: Destin'd, in spite of malice, to be great, His daring soul contemns the tricks of state: Swiftly, he bids his glad commanders meet, And lead their army to the waiting fleet: Their swelling hopes the swelling gales invite, And heaven, and they, propitiously, unite: In loud salutes, the deep-mouth'd cannons roar, Answer'd, by zealous wishes, from the shore: Whence mingled crowds their hearty prayers repeat, 'Till rising waves obscure the sailing fleet. On the extremest limits of that land, Thro' which the Tagus, rich in golden sand, His rapid course, in depth of waters bends, And twice two hundred miles his stream extends; Old Barcelona, strong by nature, stands, And rules a vast extent of fertile lands: With rocky mountains, half environ'd round, The other half, by bogs, and marshy ground: Beneath her walls, surrounding trenches lie, Beyond those depths, rise bulwarks, vastly high: Walls within walls, the solid place defend, Where watchful Centinels their charge attend: Whence trains of hollow brass, with fiery breath, Vomit black sulph'rous messages of death; Ram'd with destruction, burst with horrid roar, And scatter terrors, round the trembling shore. Hither, with crowded sails, the Britons bent, Big with the message, their great mistress sent: Their warlike souls to emulation rise, And breathe out pious wishes, to the skies: And, now, those powers, which brave designs attend, Had brought their voyage to a happy end: From Barcelona's tow'rs, with wild affright, The trembling foe beholds th' unwelcome sight; A mighty fleet, approaching, by degrees, In graceful order, plows the smiling seas; Harmonious music spreads the joy, they bring, And clam'rous shouts proclaim the coming king: The sounding trumpets his intent declare, And waving streamers flourish in the air: Arriv'd, at length, the cannons loudly roar, And shake, with panic fright, the wond'ring shore. Mean while, the Spaniards all their force prepare, And arm, confus'dly, for defensive war: Blind, with amazement, and ignoble fear, They double all the Britons, that appear: All think with horror, England, now, had bent Her utmost force, to form one grand descent. But, when they saw so small a number land, And boldly tread the surface of their sand, The paler marks of fear forsook their face, And wonder, far more great, supplies the place. An equal force, within their walls, they found, Yet, fear'd, to meet their foes, on equal ground: They saw, with wonder at an act, so vain, Th' undaunted Britons win the neighb'ring plain, Where, soon, their squadrons form'd a camp, and then, They thought, or dreaded, they were more, than men. Thus had the great Camillus forc'd his way, And, void of fear, in midst of dangers, lay: Impatient of delays, the Austrian youth, Deep-touch'd with sorrow, listen'd to the truth: He saw the weakness of his daring few, And, with concern, his foe's advantage knew: The brazen tubes of death were mounted high, And clouds of rolling smoke obscur'd the sky; All this, and more, from his small camp, was seen, And death, disguis'd with horror, stalk'd, between. The aged chiefs, in cautious war, grown old, Wou'd rather be too backward, than too bold: Therefore, advis'd the Prince to haste away, Since 'twas scarce possible, to live, and stay. The Prince, with melancholy thoughts opprest, Came to Camillus, and unlock'd his breast; Told him the pangs of sorrow, shame, and rage, Which shook the blooming comforts of his age: Told him the flames, in which his soul wou'd burn, Shou'd he thus, unsuccessfully, return. With grief, the gen'rous Briton heard him tell The deep misfortunes, he but knew, too well: He rolls his eyes, accuses partial fate, And tells the Austrian, that he shou'd be great. Resolv'd to act, the council speak, in vain, And, by debates, protract the fall of Spain: Camillus had a soul, whose heavenly fire Cou'd compass all things, and to all aspire. Himself, alone, cou'd with himself debate, And mov'd, obscurely, like the hand of fate. Hard by the towers of Barcelona, stands, High, on the rocks, o'erlooking neighb'ring lands; A strong-built castle, whose extended sway Obliges ev'n the city, to obey. Five hundred men the solid ramparts keep, On rocks, beyond imagination, steep: Whence rolling stones invading foes can chase, When, with an aking eye, they climb the dreadful place. This was the source, whence victories must flow, Hither the British chief resolv'd to go: Unus'd to fear, and more unus'd to boast, With temp'rate words, he chear'd his wond'ring host; Strove not to hide the hazard of the task, Nor cover danger, with a gilded mask: He bids each soldier, like himself, perform, And, by example, wins 'em, to the storm. The rosy morning usher'd in the sun, Which was to see a bloody business done; His beams shone bright, to guide the battle well, And drank their blood, in pity, as it fell: Eight hundred Britons, on this glorious day, O'er pathless forests, force their oblique way: In tedious march, o'er high ascents, they past, And won the dangerous precipice, at last. With strange surprize, the Spaniards rush to arms, And bells rung backward, in confus'd alarms: The summon'd soldiers hurry to their post, And pour whole vollies on the climbing host: Repeated charges from the cannons fly, Like fiery meteors, blazing, thro' the Sky: The shatter'd limbs of men, who nobly dare Are borne on bullets, thro' the flaming air: The dismal prospect shocks the bravest hearts, And adds new motion, to disjointed parts; The brave Camillus, with a fierce delight, Drives on the head-long fury of the fight: Urges his bleeding troops, still higher, and higher, And scatters death for death, and fire for fire. Thus, when, of old, the mighty giants strove, To check the boundless power of angry Jove; With force, like this, but, in a cause, less good, The huge Briareus, their great leader! stood; The solid centre shakes, beneath his weight, Who, all-unknowing, or, unfearing fate, Kicks at the thunder, which, with horror, flies, And, while swift light'ning flashes, in his eyes, Tears up a hundred rocks, and hurls 'em at the Skies. But now, aloft, the mingled war grows high, On heaps, promiscuous numbers fall and die; Rivers of blood, from the mix'd battle, flow, Till death, scarce, sees, to guide a destin'd blow. The walls are won, the Spaniards lose the day, And crowding Britons win the cover'd way: While some, on high, the conquer'd pass defend, Others, below, by mutual help, ascend: No more, the driven foes their fortune try, But quit their bloody battlements, and fly: Despair, and horror, fill the dismal place, And terror sits, enthron'd, on every face. Destructive fate grows cruel, to excess, And rages, blindly, in her blackest dress: Matrons, and virgins, weep, with bitter cries, And noisy sorrows pierce the distant Skies. But cease, mistaken wretches! cease your moan. Proud of your conqu'ror, your conquest own; Your friends, victorious, might tyrannic be, Your foes but conquer you, to set you free. No base design distains a Britons cause, But pity guides the sword, which justice draws. With such success, was that great day begun, Which not the army, but their general, won: While he, impatient his great task, to end, Which heaven appear'd, so early, to befriend, Chears his glad soldiers, with divided gain, And leads 'em down, undreading, to the plain: Ranges 'em, widely, near the city's bound, Resolv'd to force a place, they scarce surround. Thus, moves he, brightly, like some wand'ring star, And scorns the heavy arts of common war: In their own fire, his matchless actions blaze; He needs no council, and he seeks no praise: While other generals tedious projects form, He thinks, and acts, and wins applause, by storm: With furious courage stands, and tempts his fate, But heaven, still, spares the man, to bless the state. With threat'ning look each ready Briton stands, And sharp-edg'd weapons grace their warlike hands: Obsequious silence waits the General's nod, As antient Grecians watch'd the Delphian God. Mean while, each trembling tow'r, with horrid dread, Loosen'd its walls, and shook its batter'd head: The lofty works, which shou'd the town defend, The shocks of hostile thunder, widely, rend: Amidst these crowds of terrors and despair, The Britons, for a sharp assault, prepare: The Spaniards see, and shun the lou'ring Fates, And, widely, open their submissive gates. And, now, the mighty deed is greatly done; A king reliev'd, and kingdoms, bravely, won. The warlike Chief, with glory, fir'd his breast, Forgot his pleasures, and forsook his rest: The Austrian fix'd—He, bravely, onward bent, And conquer'd rebel countries, as he went: The stubborn Catalans, unus'd to bow, Gladly, submit, to firm subjection, now: With joyful shouts, their happy monarch greet, And leave their mountains, for the regal seat; That strong-built fort, whose state the rest excell'd, And thrice ten thousand Gallic foes repell'd, Afraid to strive, her iron gates unlock'd, And gladly open'd, when Camillus knock'd. To his successful arms, whole nations yield, And, freely, give him up an untry'd field. At his bless'd feet, the rich Tortosa lay, And matchless conduct gain'd him Lerida. Valencia's kingdom, gloriously, he won, And triumph'd, o'er the prostrate Arragon. But hold, unwary Muse! no higher soar; He, who did this, alas! must do no more! Oh! that thy numbers cou'd but reach my aim, How wou'd I celebrate his glorious name! How wou'd I paint the battles, he has won, And all the noble actions, he has done! How wou'd I paint him, spilling gen'rous blood, And tempting death, for his dear country's good! How wou'd I draw his two illustrious Sons, Proud of their mangled flesh, and shatter'd bones! How wou'd I tune my elevated song, And shame the men, who do Camillus wrong! But, since his works, thro' clouds, are forc'd to shine, How cou'd I hope success, from such, as mine? Let virtue be rewarded, if it can, When gratitude forgets so great a man. Free Thoughts upon Faith: Or the Religion of Reason. Oh, thou!—who-ere, what—ere, where-ere, thou art, Sole—or associated—conceiveless power! In search of whom, o'erstretch'd Idea bursts; And sense rolls back, on darkness—cause, uncaus'd! Progressive un-beginner—without end! Giver, of thought, oh, guide it.—Arm a mind, Tremblingly struck,—to stem but one short glimpse, One distant, transient, momentary, flash Of thy keen light—and live!—oh!—far from dream To draw th' Almighty's deign'd approach too near— All, that my soul's touch'd sense aspires to tell Is,—that she dares not view thee—thou, who know'st The muse's conscious rev'rence—aid her song. Awefully shrinking from th' assumer's hand, That points me to thy place, thy power, thy will, Astonish'd at his pride! I start—and fly. O, pityer of presumption! whence aspires Awak'ning dust's brief glance of shadowy life, To launch its little plummet—into depths, Profounder, than Eternity!—how dare O'erweening, mole-blind, furro'wers of dark earth Engross, to their low selves, their God's whole care? Slight nobler orbs,—as skirts to this dim ball, That, day by day, rolls round its eye-less bulk, To beg light's needful alms, from one, kind sun— While tracts, superior to conception's bound, See suns, in millions, o'er new Worlds, pour blaze— Yet, reach but confines of new Suns—and die! Require not these vast works of God God's grace, Proportion'd to their vastness?—how, then, dares Conceit's proud pref'rence of its own clay'd cott O'erleap those azure voids—where thought, and space, And number, and immensity,—are lost: And comprehension akes, to scale repulse! Whence had man's insect arrogance of guess Such impotent out-starting—to presume, His momentary nothingness of grasp Cou'd know, task, limit, and describe—his God! Say, bigot boaster of unmanner'd zeal, Thou, that art impudently sure, of heaven! And, cov'ring blasphemy, behind faith's name, Sin'st deepest, where, most, sanctified!—weigh, pause, Think—answer not, from custom's light assent: But the try'd soul's true test, un-warp'd, within. —Is it in Revelation's aweful claim, That dust should dare mis-plead th' almighty's Will, For insult on his Justice?—dare men pass For intimates of heaven, who, thus, degrade Th' all-gladd'ning Lord of all those wid'ning worlds— To one poor partial care, of one poor part, Of one poor corner, of one world's poor clan? Out with this av'rice of fanatic scrape! That, pinching, to itself, God's nibbled grants, Hedg'd in th' eternal's common! Greedily, Forestall'd all power of op'ning mystery's gate, For it's own pick-lock tribe—un-key'd by heaven. —Why, if enlighten'd most, should will most dark Bid these few, fav'rite, hand-led, spies, of grace, Conceal from modest doubt their arts to know? —Why, if possess'd of some eductive clue, That shews lost diffidence truth's lucid ray, Claim they consent, implicit!—Why submits Belief, to bold assumption?—tasteless faith Dishonours, where it worships. Heaven disdains Obedience from the blind: and every sect Were orthodox—if to believe is Proof. To me:—nor let the rev'rence of my pause Offend the power that caus'd it!—it shou'd seem More impious, to decide, of God, than doubt. Oft, when I pant for aid, to shake distrust, Humbling imperious reason, while I bend With meek attention, to the calls of faith, Where pious fury lends the pastor gall: And what falls short in proof o'erflows, in rage— —While revelation, thund'ring on my ear, Low-rates my hearts admission—help me, heaven! To check th' impassive struggler's infelt hint; That asks, how God's almighty? if his Will Who made this captious world, whereon we crawl Cou'd to the worm call'd man, be shewn, in vain. —If 'twas the maker's law—to man proclaim'd, By man's resistless God—my trembling soul Whispers in shiv'ring horror,—Oh 'tis strange!— God will'd—God spoke that will—yet, Man—proud dirt! Divides, disputes, examines—disobeys!— —Had heav'n requir'd, cou'd heav'n want force to cause? Or, not requiring, why was heav'n profan'd? Hum, from thy dusky hive, unreas'ning drone, Stretch thy tame wings—heave thy dull search along; Leave thy cav'd home behind—and look, more wide. —Seest thou not, every where, earth's emmet swarms, Scheming their busy mount's loose-crumbling hope— For the next cataract shower,—that sweeps down all. —Such are the toils of Mufti's, Popes, Pauwau's, Lhamas and Rabbis, Morabuhts, Bonzees, All the long-labouring props, of faith's lost boast; Fabricks of tow'ry air—that fright—and die. O'er worships thus distinct, have sep'rate Gods Presided?—or, beneath but sep'rate names, Did one sole power inspire divided prayers, And smilingly accept 'em?—Nature feels This question: and, methinks, I hear her voice, Bid reason thus reply—If but one light Insur'd salvation's course,—un-socketed, Un-lanthern'd, It had known no curtail'd shine. All dark had been illumin'd;—ne'er withheld Just heaven, from more than half th' extended globe, All glimpse of dawn, yet curs'd, the gloom he caus'd! Or, grant some race indulg'd with kinder smile, Why partial to the proud? Sin's haughtiest sons? Yet heedless of unfolded flocks, more meek, More aw'd, more simply serious, in faith's field; Anxious, in adoration's twilight gleam, And prostrate, tho' neglected?—Why again! In truth's appropriate and selected seats, Shoots Eden's heaven-watch'd tree, for-ever prun'd, For-ever fruitless? into monstrous growths, Of thorn-branch'd opposition?—If, to doubt Religion's lifeless form were to destroy The essence of her purpose, why, o'er lands, That boast high claim to systems heav'n-inspir'd, Spread schemes, of diff'rent texture?—Each avow'd God's own injoin'd sole path, reveal'd, to save? Alas! 'tis man's proud heart—that, idly fill'd, With self-paid rev'rence, for desert mis-claim'd, Grown impious, in imagin'd rectitude, Hugs his own day-dreams, idoliz'd within— And styles 'em revelation!—Hence the buz Of honeyless, and stingful wasps of zeal: Alike, on all sides heard—and felt on all! Each, charg'd, in heaven's pretence, with menace'd hell! Jews, Tartars, Bramins, bord'ring Ganges' flood, Swift hords, of hot Arabia's swarthy sons; Far China's dateless race—Long Nile's old claim To superstition's childhood.—Each, heav'ns choice Yet, each from each distinct, all, spurn'd by all, Split revelation, into canton'd snarls: And murder, to shew Mercy!—damn—to save! Even these divisions, sub-dividing on, Break from their center, like the wind's wide points, Yet, every radius right!—and every, wrong! —All err—but each,—peace be to that, alone! The rest, let war involve—and curse their creeds! Where art thou found, fair Charity?—sweet power! That stills the stormy soul!—soft Cherub's eye! That weep'st, at all this mischief—see'st man's pride Mistaken, for his virtue!—arguing, low, In the calm voice of pity's whisp'ring God, The od'rous breathings of thy balmy hush Fly, scatter'd, on the winds of keen debate. Lost, and benighted, in this warring wild, How shall a lightless wand'rer find, which front Bears heav'n's commission'd stamp?—and which bold brow, Fright'ning credulity, miscals it faith? Bid Miracles decide contested claim. Where are they? call aloud.—They shun to hear. Prudent restraint forbids expectant prayer To court renewal of old eye-sight proofs, Which deign'd in days long past—to strike doubt dumb. Dead time's departed ghost, recorded, holds Millions of wonders done—Faith's grey supports! —But, millions of pretences, too,—diffus'd O'er earth's contentious face, each unlike each, As night's dim veil, compar'd with sun-gilt day! Match miracles 'gainst miracles, array'd, And push back ev'ry Angel's vain descent, Who comes, on errands hostile to their own. Where miracles try truth, no faith is false. What nameless, corner of the world—untouch'd By trade's far-furrowing keel—even safely new To the unquenchable, and sacred, thirst Of missionary rapine's holy ken— But boast believ'd descent of some kind God, That chose their lov'd fore-fathers, blest their race, And taught 'em, for his glory?—Fill'd with trust In their transmitted tale, th' invited guests Take place, at heaven's high table—upmost, all. The white-fac'd, olive-hued, the sably jet, The grease-anointed, woolly-headed, shorn, Long-hair'd, and short-hair'd, curl'd and cropt Elect— All, sagely satisfied, All else must err— Swol'n with inflative zeal, catch martyr's flame: And die—to live again—in scorn of pain. Since then, th' extremest polar tracts, of faith, Where reason's one eye winks, unbeam'd for day, Plead Miracles in proof—which none can try, Because but, heard not seen—let Learning shun Such hoary feebleness of palsied plea: Which error must assert—or truth disclaim. But, off! stand wide—make room, ye coarse profane! Ye vulgar of religion's suburb world! Ye Goats un-shepherded! un-fish'd-for shoals! Un-mesch'd, by mystic union's indragg'd Net Of never-erring sweep, deduc'd from heaven! Room, for the papal Pontiff's triple crown! NOW—heretic presumer!—bow, convinc'd Infallibility unwinds her scroll: —Saints, martyrs, angels, seventeen cent'ries down, Link power to power, and lenght'ning truth's old rod, Lend faith Tradition's line—to hook mankind. Hail, venerable weakness!—aweful dream! Shade, of a shadow!—thou, that blindly hop'st, By twice nine age's loud-concurring noise, To drown soft reason's evidence!—yet, shun'st To recollect, how thrice ten cent'ries join'd Their vain support—yet saw Jove's fabrick fall! Plead'st thou duration? plead'st thou breadth of space? What art thou, but an infant's tott'ring Step, Compar'd to mightier growths, now found no more? —Where are the Deities of muse-tongu'd Greece? Greece, from whose hundred states, strong science flow'd: And arms, and arts, in one mix'd blaze of power, Held out high Freedom's torch, to half mandkind! Where is her Phœbus?—where her Neptune—now? Turn thy sight Eastward, o'er the time-hush'd plains, Now graves, of vanish'd empire—once, gleam'd, o'er, From flames on hallow'd altar's, hail'd by hymns Of seers—awakeners of the worship'd Sun! —Ask silent Tigris—bid Euphrates tell— Where is the grove-crown'd Baal, to whose stern frown Bow'd haughty Babylon?—Chaldea, fam'd For star-taught sages: Hard Phoenicia's sons, Fierce, fear-surmounting, curbers of the deep! Who stretch'd a floating scepter o'er the seas, And made mankind one empire?—Where is, now, Egypt's wide-homag'd Isis?—where the Mars, That shook, the shakers of the Roman world? Where the Teutonic Woden! in his name, Alone, still reverenc'd, each revolving week, Even in fair Albion's isles!—If Age bore proof, Why have these sunk? why all the lifeless Gods, Lost Demi-gods, long, nameless, countless, powers! That fill'd th' adoring world, with fabled fame? Are they not dead? whelm'd o'er in time's black tide? And known, but by contempt—to mem'ry's claim? How was this possible—had noise been proof? Of faith's extent in space, with realms, for guard, Mellow'd mistake, to equity?—Far short Of heaven, fall Time's perspective—vainly climbs Guile-founded God-craft. Let proud fortune spread The lye-tipt pyramid's broad covering base, Till earth groans wounded, at th' oppressive weight, Still, but, the wider ruins, mark its fall. —Let him, who boasts blind multitudes convinc'd, Or builds on time, for truth's imagin'd test, Ask his unjudging rashness—what rent heart Of celtic Druid, but had shook, more bow'd, Than his storm-lab'ring oak—cou'd some pale shade, That scann'd futurity, pointing thro' fate, Have shewn him his insulted God-head's doom! Nor let vain pref'rence of our own touch'd sense, Our own-seen surer lights, our own safe trust, Degrading antient stubbornness in faith, O'er-rate attachment's warmth, as, now, most strong. —What aw'd allegiance, what more firm belief, What haughtier sureness, more imprints the soul, By modern truth's new cast of thought inspir'd, Than sway'd the solemn Pagan's breast, of old, When bow'd, before his Idols?—Idols, (now)— But (then)—vindictive Gods, who shook mankind. Where are faith's Certainties—if time's best boasts, Sacred to arts, arms, numbers, learning—all!— All, fam'd, beyond fate's dread, found, all Unsure? Whence, then, th'imperious, positive, disdain, That spurns back modest doubt—and damns debate? Where, the foundation, of that holy scorn, Which lifts the Bigot's brow, to scowl reproach? To pity, sects, that hurl his pity back, And hate him,—for his hatred?—If nor Time, Nor Numbers, who sustain'd th' attested cause, Nor Miracles, renown'd in reverend hoards, So aweful, that no sacrilegious mouse Dare satiate hunger on the dust-veil'd roll, But dies, to leave, untouch'd, the dry record— If evidence, like these, falls short of proof, Where, in what dark domain, of thought's deep maze, Shall reason—through doubt's crooked windings drawn, Find truth's white face, un-spotted?—Think: and tell. What, if we seek her, in man's moral walks? Judge her by Life's try'd practice!—what, more just, Than to conclude, the Saint's uncensur'd deeds Lend sanction, to his doctrine?—Here, methinks, Truth loves to chuse her test. Yet, here, (again) We wander—into new defect of plea, That proves too much—or nothing.—Cou'd loose life Infer false faith,—how stain'd even Christian zeal! Where avarice, and revenge, and pride's big bloat, Taught guilt's blood-colour'd hat to hint church Spleen: Whence, murders, robb'ries, treach'ries, perj'ries, rise, Like taints effluvient from infectious fens, Dispeopling, in their progress!—un-aten'd, Till death-bed sanctity absolves remorse, By scar'd conformity, to faith's flat modes— To mock'ries of belief—and rotes of prayer! Since then, bad life, must leave no stain on faith, Try, if life's Purity refines coarse creeds? Try, if the good man's virtues church his claim? No—If they cou'd—then pole from pole but bounds Th' extensive, true-nam'd, Church's general pale. Dreadful indeed were (then) th'excluder's power! Then—excommunication's reachful hand Had push'd off exiles, to new worlds—ere dead! For, this had, all, been Church—one truth's known claim: Turks, Jews, wild Afra's Wood-men,—India's Mopes, Who pine, in pang-ful abstinence from sin, And shudder, but, to crush the trodden fly: Australia's art-untasting solitudes, Where all ambition's wealth is ease from care; And hope's consumptive diet starves desire: Columbia's many-peopled bow'ry groves, Fanning, in feath'ry pomp, her tawny tribes, From the sun's down-driv'n ray:—Cold Zemhla's cots, Of fish-fed shiv'rers, furr'd in shaggy mail, Trampling the ice-bound ocean, whiten'd o'er With endless snows, to spoil the spoilful Bear: All, among these, who love not vice, draw claim, From Lives, of simplest sanctity—to heaven: And multiply th' elect—were virtue faith. PAUSE here, encompass'd soul. Look round. reflect. Engulph'd and central to this whirl of tides, With each proud vortex threat'ning—all, to shun Seems safer, than trust either. Hark! they roar. Look, with what rage they whiten!—All foam sure: All climb, to drown each other. None recede: None conquer. Universal uproar reigns— And faith's a fighting Chaos—Is this truth? This, revelation's word, disclos'd by heaven? Boldly, refuse consent—It cannot be. What, then, must be believ'd?—Believe God kind— To fear, were to offend him. Fill thy heart With his felt laws: and act the good he loves. Rev'rence his power. Judge him, but, by his works: Know him, but in his mercies. Rev'rence, too, The most mistaken schemes, that mean his praise. Rev'rence his Priests—for, every priest is his,— Who finds him, in his conscience—by what name So-ere distinguish'd—howso-ere misdrawn, They deviously believe—What, tho' they preach Perdition to the mod'rate! Truth dares owe Respect, to Error: if it's end is grace, And aims at reformation. Mindful, yet, Men are but men. Where most thou trust'st—beware. Stretch not esteem, to homage. Be, nor slave, Nor censurer: but, hear strong Reason's voice, Tongu'd, by the power who loves it. And, since that Crys Liberty, too loud for law to drown, Free thy chain'd thought, from fears unworthy God, And know him for himself—Were one prim form, One forc'd identity, the maker's wish, Ne'er had that wish prov'd frustrate. Dare not doubt But he, whose will was power—whose wish compels, Had moulded all, to that one form, he lov'd. Loves he not Unity? He does.—But, know, The unity, God loves, is lodg'd in mind. 'Tis the heart's conscious glow—that beats to thank, Not scrutinize, his bounty. 'Tis the chain, That links Intention—in one warmth of Will: Not binds to one forc'd act, of outward Form. Thus thinking—thou wilt feel the Godhead, right: Unclosing, in a house of jointed stone, Him—in whose temple twenty thousand Suns Serve but as lamps—and all their spangly Worlds Form footsteps to his altar—This, believe: And dread no vengeance, on mistaken man, Unadequate, to man's brief power in sin, Offending grain, of animated dust! 'Gainst him, beneath whose smile the Stars catch fire! Fill'd with ideas, thus becoming heaven, Pity the hag-ridd'n quiv'rer, who contracts To superstition's gloom, religion's Joy, And humbles adoration, into dread. Who, eke-ing his inch'd measure, from within, Peeps thro' his narrow soul's dim loop-hole wink, And insolently, by his own scale, takes The altitude of Heaven—But, if, compell'd To lend thy patient ear,—and press'd too hard, By self-sufficiency of teazing faith, —That—nothing knowing,—will be sure of all— Hear, with dumb smile: and, ask'd, why reason's range Acquits dissention—teach thy judging Eye To read God's answer, in his works for man: Where do they tell thee, Sameness was his choice? How various are his creatures! various, all, His animal, his vegetable, tribes: Earth's, air's, wide ocean's products—all, un-like. In qualities, forms, colours, diff'rent, all. —Tread but th' enamell'd Mead—or, o'er yon Fields, 'Twixt the wind-waving Corn, indent thy way. Or, partial to the Garden's painted proofs, Lend there, thy first, pleas'd noting—Snuff this air: How numberless the scents, yet each distinct, Of every tree's known bloom!—Lean o'er these flow'rs— Lowliest, yet loveliest! Excellence, depress'd! Worth trod on by despisers! short-liv'd sweets! How oppositely soft, the streak-touch'd shades, That tinge their fragrant families!—Turn short, From pity due, to life so lov'd, so brief! Wish'd long, by ev'ry shortner!—Now, look out, On yon fair op'ning plain—There herb meets herb, All green—yet none resembling! Shades, less deep, Touch lights, more soft'ning: feastful to the eye, That dwells, on their distinctions!—Still, new glows Diversify the verdure's fluid Surge: And dance, delightful, to the breezy bend! Next, up this steepy shelve, ascending slow, Win we the Down's high top—whose carpet mound Ends at the jutting Cliff, that shades the shoar. Hence, to the wing-divided air, extend Survey's charm'd outlet—O'er this upper sea, Where meditation founders,—flights immense Cross-cut the winnow'd Æther. Black, white, grey, Red, blue, brown, golden, verdant, motley-stain'd— Distant in size, as colours!—'Mongst 'em all, None looks, nor calls, like other. No sweet bird, That beats the pathless void, but pours new notes; Distinct, from every plumey rival's song. Stop thy endanger'd foot. Recal the range Of thy recovering eye—bend o'er the brow Of this touch'd precipice: and, hence, look down, Where the broad sea, scarce heard, rolls murmering, in. Ponder the Deep's dumb legions—Infinite Their numbers! still more infinite, their shapes, Bulks, movements!—Swift, slow, timid, fierce, horn'd, barb'd, Coatless, finn'd, scaly, shell'd, wing'd, motionless: All diff'ring—till immensity grows tir'd, To note their changeful natures!—Can it be, That he, who fill'd each crowded element, With unresembling sons of endless change— Peopled each puny drop, with varied states— Each leaf, with new-shap'd nations too minute To dread ambition's ravage—veil'd each path To heaven's blue lawns, with clouds, that shift each hour, Form, texture, hue—to suit their painted glow To man's undazzled gaze—attemp'ring lights, That teach the sun's too fervid beam to break In coloury rays, and touch the sight, more safe! —Can it be possible—that He,—pleas'd power! Who o'er Creation's glebe, sow'd seeds of change, Shou'd, but from Unity's bald harvest, reap! And burn,—for tares—those beauteous growths, he rais'd, To smile such lov'd variety!—'Twere Sin— 'Twere blasphemously blind—to dream such wrong. No—let me, fill'd with awe, think fear a fault. Fear but affronts the God, I'm born, to love. I am, but by his pity: and want weight To justify his anger.—If I err 'Gain'st in-lodg'd impulse, by his goodness lent, To guide man's choice to virtue, some sure fate, From suff'rings adequate, must punish guilt. But what, where, how—he, who decreed, can tell. —If, by mistake, on life's blind rocks I split, By no safe Pilot pointed out, to shun, There—erring weakness meets avoidless sin: And needs no pardon: for it meant no wrong. Doubt all faiths, boldly, then—undoubting God, Appendant to no pride, mis-rob'd like zeal, Hope all men bless'd alike—and injure none, Grateful, I'll trace the fainter lights I find, Un-envying other's blazing:—humbly, own My aw'd conviction, of man's reachless power To pierce omnipotence—and know it, near. Let me, with distant rev'rence, pond'ring, dumb, Dread arrogant decision; persecute No fancied heresy—but, closing, calm, Opinion's dazzled eye, bow darkly down, And hail th' unfathom'd vastness! Thro the dusk Thought fails to penetrate, revere what is— Undaring to describe it. Let no pomp Of positive presumption swell my soul, To self-preferring scorn, of alien creeds, Uncertain, in my own: Yet—sure, of this, That virtue cannot err, but judgment may. Peacefully patient, let me travel out Life's unoffending journey. Mark, well-pleas'd, New prospects, manners, tastes, beliefs, chang'd modes, New systems—Every view, that sides my way, Unprejudic'd to any: till—at last Death opening truth's barr'd gate, 'tis time, to see God's meanings—in the light, his presence lends. Sareph and Hamar: An Episode. From a Poem call'd GIDEON. Joash from Ophra now was come, dispatch'd by Gideon's care, Attended by the lately pardon'd ten; These in the shortest roads, experienc'd were, All grateful, brave, and dext'rous men: But chiefly Phurah had a foul too strong For fortune's adverse weight to strain, or bend: Though low his lot, his mind cou'd upward tend: He, much inur'd to grievous wrong, Had mark'd, that interest was mens common end; And since his former happier life, such misery did attend, He little hop'd his woes wou'd make a friend: But when by Gideon's noble pity sav'd, He look'd more nearly thro' the hero's breast: No more he mourn'd, that he was once enslav'd, But the delightful misery blest; Which, thro' the worst of human kind, thus led him to the best; And burnt, impatient, with a gen'rous aim, To serve his glorious lord's designs, and his high worth proclaim; Well mounted, and well arm'd, a trusty guide; He follow'd Joash, with a chosen train; Who slow descending rough Bethulia's side, Saw Midian's marching host o'erspread the plain: And keeping near, had well observ'd the way, 'Till now encamp'd on Rama's hills they lay. Joash, unwilling to advance more nigh, 'Till he had weigh'd their aim, the following day; Resolv'd that night beneath his tent to lie, On a declining spot, which charm'd his eye; And sloping to the river's edge, was by a forest crown'd: Half wilderness, half garden, widely sweet, Where self-sown rose-trees shade the well-swarth'd ground, And o'er the fragrant tops, thick-arching meet Wild Orange trees, whose flow'ry breath perfumes the breezes round, Charms, which at once cou'd all the senses greet, And did in unbought store for each, with bounteous care abound, Low, on the river's grassy brink, he sees A meadow, shelter'd round with branchy trees; His mules and camels, there, he turn'd to graze, While higher in the grove he stays, Beneath the canopy to pass the night; Where the highway, near bord'ring, reach'd his sight; Refresh'd by sleep, he rose serene and gay, And walk'd abroad to see the breaking day, With dawning lustre, thro' the boughs, in trembling sallies play. Where-e'er he pass'd, the golden fruit hung low And dancing, wanton, bow'd to court his hand, Proud of the native charms they had to show; While, from above, the sweet wind-wasted flow'rs, Rain'd on his silver hairs, in milk-white show'rs; Modest, the blushing rose-trees round him stand, And, rudely shook, weep tears of pearly dew; And to his smell send soft complaints, and scent the forest through. Now, thro' the grove, the thirsty Sun did his hot face disclose, And drank the steamy nectar, as it rose; When Joash, looking out upon the plain, Beheld a comely youth approach the grove; Weary he seem'd to walk, and full of pain, As if against some inward woe he strove; Close after him an ill-shap'd ass he led, Whereon sate pensive, as in deep distress, A lovely woman, with declining head. Rich in her charms, but careless in her dress; Often the youth look'd back with am'rous air, And mix'd much tenderness with constant care, Curious, and wond'ring what this pair shou'd be, Joash sate low, against a bending tree, Whence, 'twixt the bushes, he unseen cou'd see. When they close and sheltry umbrage gain'd, Soft in his arms, the youth his fair companion took, Proud of the burthen, his glad grasp obtain'd, And with slow step, and love directed look, Chose a well-swarth'd and shady spot, and having plac'd her there, Sate down himself, and seiz'd her hand, and sigh'd with silent care. Long on his face, with blushful innocence. And unspoke meanings fill'd, she fix'd her eyes, At last, with all love's natural eloquence, Thus her soft soul, her trembling tongue supplies. O SAREPH! how capricious is our fate! Sure, I was doom'd to mis'ry from my birth, While I was blind, and wou'd not know thy worth. Then I had power to give it a reward; But now, when thou hast won my whole regard, When sick with shame, I see how much I owe, And wou'd with joyful gratitude bestow; I find myself distress'd and poor and loss'd in wilds of woe: Why wilt thou share in my afflicted state, And by partaking give my griefs new weight? Leave me, too gen'rous youth! to bear ill fate alone; Let pains to-come, past pride atone; Why, Sareph, shou'dst thou die for me, Who thought it hard to live for thee? Alas! how hopeless thus unknown, to roam! What can we meet abroad but misery, Who found no friends at home? Wide is the world, my Sareph, and but few To pity the unhappy are inclin'd; Vast is the sorrow, we must travel through, And small the speck of hope we go to find: Oh! 'tis too hard to fall from wealth and fame, To pinching hunger, and to pining shame: Why live we longer then, since life is curst? The beggar's lot is bitt'rer, than the grave. Misery's too patient, when she waits the worst; By death, at once, the wretched and the brave May mend their fortune, and their honour save: More she had said, but rising grief her breaking voice opprest A-while, with speaking tears, she look'd the rest, Then sigh'd, and with declining head fell soft against his breast. Charm-cover'd Hamar, the sad youth reply'd, And half his mantle o'er her gently threw; Unus'd to want, nor yet in misery try'd, Rest, now, in safety, by my guardful side: Faint with thy toils, and damp and cold, with night's descending dew, Sleep will refresh thee, and thou then may'st find Courage restor'd, revive thy waking mind: That heav'n, which help'd thee to escape thy foes, Well thy wond'rous virtue knows. And will pursue thee with reward, where-e'er thy beauty goes. Nor fear, that, being strangers, and unknown, We wander, hopeless, o'er the world's wide breast; Alas! what country can we call our own, Who have at home been thus opprest? Pity to foreign woe is soonest shown, While fear, or envy, always robs domestic worth of rest: To flourish is the way to be distrest; And safe obscurity lives still most blest. Want's heavy hand shall never drag thee down, While I have life to lavish for thy sake: Fear nothing, let storm-gath'ring fortune frown, For ever, thus, thy rest in safety take, And on my shoulders let the tempest break. Ev'n while he spoke, swift to the grove there came Four straggling plund'rers, who, from Midian's host Stole out by night, with predatory aim, To rob and murder on this peopled coast. These had, at distance, watch'd the mournful pair, And, following to the shade, surpriz'd them there. Sareph, resisting, was o'erpower'd, and all the four agree, That bound upright against a tree, Pierc'd by their arrows he dispatch'd shou'd be: And now with bloody speed, and fierce intent, Their steely bows stood strongly bent; The levell'd shafts were pointed from the eye, And the strings struggled with desire to fly: Hamar, beyond description, stunn'd with woe, Kneel'd, trembling, dumb, unfit for pray'r or flight; She felt herself a stiff'ning statue grow, Nor knew she liv'd, but by the curse of sight. Sareph, with swelling indignation choak'd, Sometimes heav'n's help, sometimes the four invok'd, Then, with mad starts of heat, their rage provok'd: Now torn with pity, now with grief, convuls'd, he rolls his eye, Now looks on Hamar with despair, now hopeful on the sky; Then stamps, and weeps, and strains his bands, and wishes but to die. Just in the fatal point, one soldier thus, With lifted hand his fellow's purpose staid: What will this stranger's death advantage us? For life perhaps a ransom may be paid: If not—To kill him, will our bliss with this fair prize destroy, Make her distasteful, sad, and coy; And blast the very spirit of our joy. But for his life she may, with willing arms, Reward us with the fulness of her charms. Whose she shall be, by lot may soon be try'd; Chance will impartially decide. Brothers, reply'd another, 'twere a shame, Shou'd lots determine in a soldier's claim: With that he hurl'd a jav'lin from his hand, And pierc'd the trunk of a distinguish'd tree: Now let us all, said he, at distance stand, And he, whose arrow, hither shot, most near this mark shall be, His be the claim, and the possessor he. The rest, with joint applause, consent declare, And backward far, their station chuse, and their best shafts prepare. Thus they, suspicious of no danger near, While Joash softly left his bushy seat, And ran, with pity touch'd, his men to meet: Soon he discern'd them, and with earnest cry, Sent his swift summons to their willing ear; They with a loud and general shout reply: The Median archers hear the noise, and quit their prize and fly. Joash with cautious foresight, check'd the haste, With which his rushing guard pursu'd their flight: On the grove's border, closely rang'd, a trusty file he plac'd; Defensive there, to watch with reachful sight: Then to Sareph drawing nigh, And viewing the transported youth with a joy-sprinkling eye, From the flesh-furrowing cords his arms he frees, Who grateful bends with rapt'rous thanks, and clasps his feeble knees. Hamar, mean-while, sunk spiritless away, And stretch'd upon the verdant surface lay; Unable passion's wild extreams, with temper to sustain; Excess of joy upon excess of grief, Drove back a tide of strong resisting pain, And overwhelm'd her with too fierce relief: But Sareph kneeling earnest by her side, Hung over her with love's officious care; A thousand soft and tender arts he try'd, A thousand times invok'd th' unanswering fair. Waking at last, to love and life, amidst a warm embrace, Her op'ning eyes flash'd sudden on his face; Then round his neck her eager arms she threw; Unguarded nature, thus surpriz'd, gave way; Recov'ring life no nice disguises knew, Passion, unfetter'd by reserve, did its full force display, And extasy did modesty betray. On either side supported, slow she went, Guided by Joash, to his distant tent; There, soft reclining, sought a short repose, Her scatter'd spirits to compose: While Joash, curious to enquire, What sad occasion plung'd them in their woe, Address'd the youth, with mild desire, The story of their mournful loves to know. Sareph comply'd with the approv'd request, And in these words, with mingled sighs, his wond'rous tale exprest. Tyre, fam'd for golden splendor o'er the east, Gave birth to Rekem of a fair descent; But who, by honest industry, his wealth so much increas'd, That he, in fortune's race, all others far outwent; Yet was he not more blest, than innocent: Rare were his virtues, and his soul as far excell'd the rest, As did his wealth—He was at once the richest, and the best. None from his friendly door were empty sent, He us'd his heaps, but as a treasure lent, To be dispos'd for others good, and not in pride mispent. He was the common father of th' opprest; To him, 'twas merit but to be distrest: My self became an early proof, how pity sway'd his heart, In helpless infancy an orphan left, At once of parents and of food bereft, Rekem, that best of men, assum'd a father's part, Sav'd me from want's soul-pinching smart, And with a gen'rous care, and lib'ral hand supply'd What my own lot, less happy, had deny'd. This lovely Hamar, here, but now enslav'd, This fainting charmer, whose dear life your timely succour sav'd, Was the good Rekem's lov'd, and only child; So soft her nature, and so sweetly mild, That upon all the world, but me, she smil'd: With bold, but fruitless passion fir'd, long time I strove in vain, The wish'd reward of lovers sighs to gain; But she, who wept at others woes, took pleasure in my pain. Rekem's superior wealth, and virtue too, On his just aims, the grievous weight of general envy drew: Out shining all, he stirr'd up all men's hate, And stood a mark for the distrustful state. They fear'd his virtues, and his wealth they sought, And secret means, to work his ruin, wrought: But long their willing malice watch'd in vain, His life, unsully'd, white and pure, disclos'd no single stain, Till fortune pointed out at last, a blind, but fatal way, At once her former blessings to betray, And to the hungry grasp of power gave up the long-wish'd prey. Scarce past a month, since from the Midian host, Which now o'er-conquer'd Israel wasteful sways, Zalmunna sent two captains to our coast, To mark our strength, and well observe our ways: These to Tyre, with vent'rous aim, Perhaps, not uninvited came; But while the city they with care survey'd, They found themselves by some ill chance betray'd: The house, they lay in, was beset by night, And one was seiz'd, and one escap'd by flight: The cautious state hence took alarm, And strait resolv'd, defensively, to arm: Maliciously inquisitive they find, That Rekem once, by public fame deceiv'd, To strangers converse ever much inclin'd; Had the two spies, as travellers, receiv'd; And feasted them with hospitable care, Tho'tless, alas! how dang'rous guests they were. Vain was the just defence his virtue made, They seiz'd his wealth, and on his ruin prey'd: And as by nature men; who once have injur'd us before, Seek their own safety from new wrongs, and still oppress us more, So with a blind, and barb'rous speed, They the good Rekem ev'n to death pursu'd; Dress'd rapine in her solemn form, and publicly decreed, That on the morning, which ensu'd, Beheaded in the market-place he should for treason bleed. But when to Hamar's ear this news was brought, Who can describe the sad effects it wrought? Imagination may perhaps conceive her dreadful state, But 'twas a misery of too much weight, Too sharp, too mighty to relate? Long was her sad, her earnest pray'r deny'd, To see her tender father, e'er he dy'd: At last, the mournful favour she obtain'd, And 'twixt two weeping maids supported went; Far in the night together they remain'd, And the dark hours in mutual mis'ry spent, 'Twixt loud complaints, and silent tears, and wild astonishment. When Hamar's pious hope, by heav'n advis'd, Wisely contriv'd her father's wish'd escape; In her loose robes his body she disguis'd, And cover'd with her flowing veil his grief-disorder'd shape; Then seeming weak with woe, and drown'd in tears, The good old man with artful step, and bent and cover'd head, Safe 'twixt the faithful maids was from the prison led: While Hamar in his dress half dead with fears, Remain'd the hostage of his flight, and saviour of his years. Heaven knows what path the hapless Rekem chose, But he has since been vainly sought by his blood-thirsty foes; Mean while, in council the grave chiefs of state Weigh the surprising deed with warm debate; Some, but, alas! how few! with generous heat, Applaud the filial piety, and her discharge entreat. But far less just the general voice agreed, That, since regardless of the laws she had her father freed, She should again discover him, or in his place should bleed. This she, tho' not expecting, bravely met, And sent for me her last long leave to take, Saraph, said she, I die without regret, Since my dear father has escap'd their net; Nor would I wish to live, but for thy sake: Long thy love hath faithful been, But thy great merit was too lately seen: A worth, like thine, in such an impious age, Might hearts less sensible than mine engage: But fate denies me now all power of choice, And all, that I can give thee, is my voice: Were I to live, my life henceforth were thine, Now death requires me, and 'tis vain ignobly to repine. By chance this jewel, rich in price, remains, Sav'd from the general wreck, and secret kept, Take it, said she, 'twill ease your life from want's voracious pains; Perhaps your search (and there she wept) May once again my now lost father find; 'Twill somewhat comfort his afflicted mind, In his distress to see you kind. And even the little this may give to share, The gratitude of you, his friend, and his dead daughter's care. I took the jewel, and o'erwhelm'd with grief, Scarce found the pow'r these words to say: Hamar, fear nothing, heaven's thy friend and owes thee sure relief. So saying, turn'd, and shot with speed away, For in that point of time, &amp;c. —The pair departed, and with busy mind Wise Joash thro' the grove reflecting stray'd; Fill'd with ideas of God's power and goodness unconfin'd, In each event discern'd to act, in every place display'd: If downward on the earth he bent his eye, The party-colour'd surface gaily dress'd, Grateful, her scented off'rings breath'd to the dew-shedding sky, And heaven's indulgent hand confess'd. If he lookt upward to the realms of light, The glowing sun blaz'd copious to his sight; Illustrious proof of power immense, and essence vastly bright, That first cou'd light up day's broad lamp, and guide the eyeless night! If he the prospect round him view'd, A vegetable nation widely spread, With long, but humbler life endu'd, Were in their seasons, by God's will, with genial moisture fed, The lowing herds in nature's lux'ry roll'd, Wallowing in verdant beds of springing grass: Air-sailing birds, with broad-spread wings in streams their flight behold, And stooping wanton to the liquid glass, With half dip'd pinions skim the floods, and sip 'em, as they pass. In these, and in all objects, he cou'd spy, Or with his gross, or intellectual eye; The formful hand of God, distinctly read, Amaz'd his thoughts, and o'er his soul a reverend horror spread. But while thus nobly he employ'd his mind, Surrounding shouts swell'd circling in the wind; The grove, on every side, resounded, with alarms Of mingled voices, crackling boughs, thick steps, and clatt'ring arms, &amp;c. The Judgement-Day: A Poem. I. Hover no more, my muse! o'er idle themes, Sliding shadows! slipp'ry dreams! By heaven's high call, from humane byas freed, Imagination climbs with dreadful speed! Unfetter'd, from earth's humble heights, I rise, And stretch sublime, a dang'rous flight, which none, untrembling, tries. Tremendous maker! arm my aking eyes; Aid and support, O God! my failing power, Teach my bold thought to wing the blazing skies! Fearless, to stem destruction's driving shower! And safe, 'twixt burning worlds, ambitious, tower. O! let my hot, my struggling bosom glow, Swol'n by a bursting flood of bright desire: 'Till the astonish'd soul is taught, with starting dread to know, How groaning nature shall, dissolv'd, expire, And tumbling orbs, with orbs involv'd, flow loose, in seas' of fire. How this blue void's immense, and concave frame; Spangled with starry worlds, to pieces broke, Shall feel heaven, round it, shrivel from the flame, And melted suns, from distant spheres, pour, liquid, through the smoke. II. Now, now, on fancy's saily wings, I rise, Aw'd, and confounded! thro' deep wilds of air: Millions of opening wonders strike my eyes, And reason's finite view is dazled here! Globes behind globes, unnumber'd, hence appear! The twinkling stars, that, from yon earth remote, Seem heaven-set gems, and scatter'd seeds of day, Here, wid'ning into flaming worlds, 'midst seas of Æther flote, And, o'er blue kingdoms, hold a fiery sway! In distant Orbits, round each reigning star, Huge earths and moons, their circly homage pay: Millions of countless miles are lost between, And sick'ning thought grows tir'd to stretch so far! How vast the concave spheres, which, hence, are seen! Th' enormous vaults, with wheeling worlds glow round! Rolling, sublime, they slide oblique, yet none their paths confound! A thousand bright cross-currents cause no jarrs, Nor one the others progress barrs; Wide, round their central worlds of fire, their various tours they make; Yet no proud planet dares his line forsake, Partial, an intercepted ray to break: They take, and lend, by turns, the streaming light, And, silent, form, in solemn round, alternate day and night! Yet, beauteous, as this heavenly fabrick shines, An hour shall come, when it must all decay; When starting man, from midnight sleep, shall see th' incumbent signs, That time is sick, and nature melts away. III. Hark! the dissolving trumpet roars! thunders o'er thunders roll! A trembling angel sounds th' eternal call! The unbounded notes whirl higher and higher, and rend my shiv'ring soul! Echoing from world to world, they burst o'er all: And gathering horrors, cold as death, in show'ry shadows fall; The conscious planets start to hear the sound, And, from their orbits, bound; Now, void of motion, and depriv'd of force, Th' arrested systems stop, at once, their course! The languid orbs, grown dim, their shine with-hold, And night creeps o'er them, in a deadly cold: The guardian angels hear the alarming blast, And, from their several stations, wing their way; Upward, in glittering crouds, they tower, in haste, And, looking back, sigh sad, and feel the day! Thin troops of naked ghosts, long stript of clay, That, wand'ring 'twixt the spheres, admiring gaz'd, Start, in loose shoals, and glide, like mists, away; Gathering above, expecting and amaz'd! Again, th' intolerable sound I hear! The dreadful summons tears my deafen'd ear. The trembling air, unbracing, lets me fall; O! save me, heaven! I sink apace, to yon benighted ball? IV. Hail! doom'd dominions! hail! my native clay! O! what a blessing, here, were vanish'd day! Again! what rumbling horror bursts its way! Save me, my God!—a flood of flashing light Gleams its red lustre, thro' the depth of night! The poles start sudden, from the frightful burst, And earth's snap'd axis, groaning, quits its trust! No more th' ungravitated globe goes round, Inward convulsions power, and form, confound; Wan desolation fades her cind'ry crust, And active life creeps thro' the quick'ning dust! Vales aw'd beneath me, at th'impending doom, In billowy heavings, roll, upright, along th' incumbent gloom! Torn from their roots, the groaning forests lie, And hills leap headlong, and invade the sky. Mankind, now, first united, join in prayer! Shrieks, from a thousand kingdoms, rend the air, And ghastly horror stalks o'er all, and leads on pale despair! V. See! how destructive flashes wind their way! And point the following thunder, where to rend! Mark! how the spouted rivers, upward, stray, And hiss against the light'nings, which descend! Heav'n! how the falling cities, buried lie! Entomb'd, in their proud palaces, earth's humbled monarchs die! See! thro' the flash'd distinction, fires can give, Naked crowds, who wish to live, Mix'd, in confusion, to the mountains run; Mountains, which, more afraid than they, have their own flight begun, And, rolling, o'er the swallow'd tribe, bring on the fate, they shun! On every side, from every part, Disjointed realms asunder start; Wide gaping clefts earth's inmost entrails show, And, from th' uprooted mountain's chasms, below, Unprison'd seas, in roaring torrents, flow. Commission'd ocean, breaking loose, disdains his crumbling bounds, And, hoarsely climbing, o'er the rocky mounds, Swallows Pyrene's snowy top, and Alpine barriers drowns. VI. Now all is ocean! and a dreadful blast, Bursts, from beneath, and swells it to the sky! Torn, from their seats, the sea-toss'd hills are 'gainst each other dash'd, And, bulging, on the foaming surface, lie; On floating oaks the wond'ring Lyon rides, And clings, majestick, to th' unstable seat! The Elephant bears up his buoyant sides, And paws the groaning waves, with his broad feet! Th' assembled birds, in clouds, skim, low, in air, Wind-shaken, scorch'd, and wash'd by driving rains; In circly flight, shrill skreams their woe declare, To find no remnant of their sheltry plains! Deep-swallow'd earth, mean while, still loos'ning more, Lets in old ocean, to her central fires; Th' astonish'd deluge, ne'er so check'd before, Shrinks from the pain, and in loud roar, retires! Close in pursuit, the bursting flame breaks thro' th' unusual vent, O'ertakes the rolling floods slow flight, and climbs th' immense extent! On all sides, now, the fire-assaulted waves, Feel themselves boil; and curl to shun the heat; A night of steam climbs, dark and broad, from their voracious graves, And plunging Whales, which no cool comfort meet, Spout the hot flood to heaven, in rage, and the froth'd billows beat. VII. Melting within, earth's sulph'ry solids flow, Pierc'd by the force of her expanding flame; Metals, dissolv'd, in blazing lakes, below, With liquid burnings, dash her concave frame! Victor, at length, out bursts the flooding fire, And rolls, triumphant, o'er the bellow'ing sea! Rivers of flaming gold, in spouts, aspire, And struggling thro' repugnant storms, a lab'ring passage free! As when from furnaces, thick smoke expires, And towers, in inky volumes, to the sky, The warring wind beats down th' unyielding spires, And spreads the sable eddies, broad, and high: So, rising hills of liquid flame, by cov'ring waves oppress'd, In glowing whirlpools, driving round, torment the ocean's breast, Furious, the batt'ling elements engage, And twisting hostile, hiss, with mutual rage, Coated with fire, in strong and rampant tides, Reluctant ocean, less'ning fast, subsides; Mix'd with the melted world, it flames all round, And seas, that drown'd the earth, themselves are drown'd. VIII. How low, proud earth, are all thy honours laid! Where are thy late-contested empires found? Where the big boasts of arts and arms display'd! Where are the dreadful pomps, which hemm'd thee round! What difference, now, 'twixt rich and poor, remains? The ruler's sceptre, and the captive's chains? Where lie the properties of boastful wealth? Distinction, and degrees, now clash no more! Pale sickness here, flows, mix'd with ruddy health, And scorn and pity, now, unite, which never join'd, before! Melting, like wax, thy kindled rocks in tow'ry flames aspire; And liquid kingdoms undulate in fire? From the sad sight, tir'd fancy! turn thy eye; See! what amazing changes blot the Sky! Longer, and louder, the last trumpet's sound Rolls its encreasing clangor to the sun; The starting fires convolve, and, backward, run, Struck to the heart, he darkens and decays, And strongly trembles, thro' his breadth of blaze; As when, in living man, some swift surprize, Chills the warm region of his beating breast: The failing members feel th' oppression rise, And hang, of force, and motion, dispossest: So, when the sov'reign sun forgets his care, Dependant worlds, in sympathetic woe, Halt in their course, and sick'ning, with despair, Their vast, ætherial rounds forgoe, And roll, in devious mischief, down the air! Yon wat'ry Moon, dissolving broad, now, seems a dusky flood, And now, at once, O, horrid change! she reddens into blood! IX. Wide from its center, see! th' escaping sun, With random dread, revolves his loos'ning spires; Cold orbs, which plac'd remote, his influence shun, Now feel th' attraction of his bordering fires. Suck'd to his burning breast, averse they flow, And icy regions roar, to meet his glow! Plung'd in embracing frost, unquench'd, he lies! And the thaw'd clime, round his hot convex fries! Worlds, by his absence, from dependance freed, Scud, in loose liberty, along the sky; Wild, and licencious, drive, with headlong speed, Till 'gainst some shoaly comet, bulg'd, they lie; So, rebel kingdoms struggling to be free, Shun regal power, and split on anarchy! See, see! where blazing orbs, in spheres remote, Wrecks of lost worlds! thro' storms of Æther flote! With spiry climb, vast tongues of fire, stretch'd high, In dreadful cones, to sweep each other try; While skies; between, shrink up, and warp their frame, As crackling Bay-leaves curl, in circling flame. X. Involv'd, at length, th' attracted planets throng, And burn, confounded, with their central suns; Tumbling, from every part, they strike, and, thund'ring rend along! Th' unhinging shock the list'ning angels stuns. Worlds against worlds, with clashing horror driv'n, Dash their broad ruins to the throne of heav'n! Thro' flaming regions of the burning air, Down rain distilling suns, in liquid rills, Mix'd with red mountains of unmelted fire! Hissing perplex'd, with showers of icy hills, And cat'ract seas, that roar, from worlds still higher; Mingled, like driving hail, they pour along, And, thund'ring, on our ruin'd system fall! Flames, grappling flames, combine, to grow more strong, And, in wild blaze, sweep, boundless, over all; One firey deluge, wasteful, boils below, And crumbled worlds, in liquid millions, flow. XI. Th' accomplish'd ruin sleeps, creation dies! And untask'd angels rove o'er empty skies! The soft'ning trumpet breathes harsh strains no more; But, in sunk sounds, grows sweet, and falls its roar! Celestial voices swell, 'twixt warbling notes, And thrilling joy, on circly rapture, floats! O'er the vast void, melodious praises flow, And list'ning fiends, from the red lake, below, Hush, for a while, the creeping flames, and half suspend their woe! But, while in deep, and fix'd attention, charm'd, Their hungry souls devour the blissful sound, By sudden silence struck, they start, alarm'd, And mark a sad! an awful! stillness, round! Conscious of coming judgment, down they sink, Diving, by thousands, thro' the burning lake; Calm with incumbent dread, from brink to brink, Th' unheaving ocean scarce is seen to quake, Nor swells one daring billow up, in firey foam, to break! XII. From shore to shore, wide, round the laky flame, High-arching heav'n contracts its springy frame! Broad, as the ruin spreads, th' unmeasur'd dome Tow'rs, in full compass, o'er the waste below! Assembling angels, now, no longer roam, But, in throng'd radiance, gild the roofy bow; A solemn black does the vast concave line, Where streaky waves of rubied redness glow; 'Twixt their loose curls, white beams, of silv'ry shine, Involv'd with rolling tides of azure, flow! Currents of mingled black, red, gold, and blue, In glitt'ring chaces, sport, perplex'd and wind, unceasing, through! Stream'd thro' the whole, a quiv'ring lustre darts, Which, as bright groups of angels interpose, A twinkling change of coloury rays imparts, And, from their wings, a show'ry light'ning throws! Far, above all, thro' the dome's op'ning crown, Broad, as a world, th' almighty's EYE looks down; Clouds of deep glory, shadowing, round, his keen refulgence hide, And dazled angels turn their eyes aside! XIII. Hark! what transporting majesty of sound, In solemn sweetness rolls its force along? Soft, and yet loud, it leads its thunder, round, And strikes chill rev'rence, thro' th' angelic throng! 'Tis the eternal's pow'rful voice! that calls, to waken death! And resurrection waits th' omnific breath! The lake groans deep! the labour will begin! O'er its broad face, life-heaving billows curl; The burning bowels sep'rate, slow, within, And smoaky clouds expire in pitchy whirl! Bodies of men, in ages, long since past, Whose wand'ring dust has chang'd a thousand forms, Purg'd, by the boiling fires, evaporate fast, And, steaming upward, rise, in misty swarms? Sexes, conjoin'd in shoaly atoms, swim, And, sallying loose, the firey surface skim! Kings, slaves, and patriots, undistinguish'd flow, And mount, entangled, from the gulph, below! In the mid-air, dispers'd, unnumber'd ways, Each in his fellow's search, instinctive, strays! Circling, like flaky show'rs of driving snow, Which whirlwinds, into mazy wav'rings, blow; In endless intricacies, winding thro', Atoms join atoms, and lost forms renew! With sympathetic cling, together fly, And limb'd, for life, in cumb'rous millions lie! XIV. Once more, sublime, th' enliv'ning voice I hear! “Souls, descend! your bodies join. Sudden, thin clouds of hov'ring lives appear, And leaning anxious, in soft squadrons, shine! Loos'd, at th'Almighty's word, distinct they fly, Swift, as the sight-beams of a human eye! Ardent, with longing shoot, each strikes his own, And smiles, to fill his long-lost home again; Bodies supine, by ent'ring breath new blown, Flash sudden, into life, and start up men! They wake! they pant! they try their limbs! they gaze! Lost, in short horror, and severe amaze! XV. Armies, unnumber'd, throng th' ætherial space, Paternal Adam views, at once, his whole collected race, And, with big tears, for conscious woe, bedews his reverend face: Parents meet children, and, transported, cling, Long-parted friends, in mutual rapture, greet, Th' obliger and th' oblig'd, together spring, And trembling traitors injur'd sovereigns meet! Cæsar on Brutus looks, serenely, down, And cloudy Cato stalks, with sullen will, Glares on him, envious, with inferior frown, And wonders, that in spite of death, he feels him conqu'ror still! Majestic, in the solemn front, of Stuart's injur'd race, The kingly martyr rears his awful brow! Pierc'd by the force of his forgiving face, A gloomy host of back'ning rebels bow! And fear, too late, that sovereign pow'r, they never own'd till now! Decrepit age, to more than youth, restor'd, And pining sickness, freed from aking pain, Exert the vigour, their new limbs afford, And move, transported, at th' apparent gain! Pale murd'rers meet, alive, whom, once, they kill'd, And rush thro' crowds th' alarming sight to shun; Usurpers fly from kings, whose thrones they fill'd, And loaded with their guilt, unwieldy, run. XVI. Fancy, thou fail'st me, here! I feel thee weak! I feel thee sink, beneath th' o'erpowring weight; Aid me, O Saviour! teach my soul to speak; Thron'd, on thy father's red right hand, in all thy dreadful state! Thou see'st the humbl'd pride of nature wait, Mankind, collected into life! the lowly, and the great: And thus, th' eternal doom thou speak'st; the sentence of their fate! ‘Come, my blest remnant, ye selected few! ‘Who practis'd, but, the obvious good, ye knew; ‘Who, safely pointed, by the guide within, ‘Struggled to virtue, and resisted sin; ‘Who, or, by prophets, or, by conscience, taught ‘Have, or discover'd truth, or, humbly, sought; ‘Who, from the guilt of choice have still liv'd free, ‘Or done, or suffer'd, for my name, and me! ‘Who, by no conscious weight depress'd, of unrepented sin, ‘Feel yourselves light, and uncondemn'd, within, ‘Rais'd, from yon dark, and sinking crowd! to heaven's high thrones aspire! ‘Enter, with me, to joys, which drown desire; ‘And leave th'accurs'd, to prove by pain, eternity in fire! XVII. 'Tis spoke: and, lo! th' unroofing arch rends wide; Swift, descends a radiant tide! An opening breadth rolls down, of sparkling day; And, like a scroll, unfolds huge length, of more than milky way! They go! th' admitted saints tread light, as air, They mount, with more than human eyes, and stem the streamy glare! Bright, as they move, th' encircling angels throng; Heard Halleluja's shake th' inferior sky! In distant thrills, expiring notes prolong, And with transporting fall of sound, in gradual soft'nings, die! See! thro' the Portal! how attracted day, Like a swift current's spiral ebb, glides, after 'em away! Now, all is dark, and dismal, as yon scene; Ah! why does closing heaven, so soon, th' entrancing prospect skreen? What does beyond those glitt'ring confines lie? And why no room, 'till death makes way, for such a wretch as I? XVIII. But murmur not, proud thought! if, here, delay'd, A wand'ring pilgrim, through this life's cold shade, I must not, yet, with heav'nly choirs, rejoice; O! be the will of God, not mine, obey'd! Wait, my impatient soul! his wiser choice! Trust the strong hand, by which those worlds were made, And to his pleasure tune thy willing voice! If I, not yet, shake off this earthy load, Sure, there is bus'ness, worth my life's best aim; He, who submits to tire upon the road, Is faintly soul'd, or travels not for fame; For me, suffice it, to have taught my muse, The tuneful triflings of our tribe to shun, And rais'd her warmth, such heav'nly themes to chuse, As, in past ages, her best garlands won! He, who beyond the pow'r of man could write, Wou'd still fall short of him, who acted well; To flow in sound, or turn a period right, Is, but in fairy tow'rs of praise, to dwell! To pardon wrongs, and benefits requite, Is, in substantial meaning, to excel! Why are my wishes bent beyond my power, But to provoke my speed, to reach that goal, Whence on the afflicted, I may comforts show'r, And, with eas'd pity, feast my hungry soul! Be Action, then, henceforth, my life's wide sphere, A thousand glorious things I wish to do; All has been said, that's worth a wise man's ear, But much may be perform'd, that's greatly new. CLEON to LYCIDAS; A Time-Piece. The Date not mark'd, by the Painter. Faith, and the muse, have err'd. 'Twas just advice, Skill'd Lycidas! that check'd too hasty praise. I shou'd have cool'd pre-currence, into pause, And weigh'd the public voice, oppos'd to mine: Then had I found the future, in the past; Nor falsely charg'd contractions puny grasp With compass, it conceiv'd not. Share, my friend, In pity, share, the pain my soul sustains, To find such hope so faded. Hope, too rais'd, To stoop at humble self: Hope, wing'd for all. All was my blasted prospect. Fond surmize O'er-rated, and out-stretch'd, a people's bliss. Bid throb, the muse's pulse—for thy sweet call, What muse, uncharm'd, can hear?—Bid burn, the brow Vindictive, and appeal due satire's frown. Due, to the stagg'rers, that made drunk by power Forget past thirst's dry promise: and presume, Dark dreamers! that the world forgets it, too. Bid the priest Poet consecrate the rage Of a wrong'd nation's curses. Rage, at zeal From ranc'rous gall, hot envy's acrid hell! Long under cloak of patriot semblance hid, Guileful to lurk in wait, till av'rice snapt Corruption's watch'd-for lure: Then, off, at once Flew wide th' obstructive virtue. Veil'd no more, Scramblers, in broad exposure's blushless brawn, Light from the dust, lick'd prone th' admissive gold, Deep-stain'd with cank'ry ordure. Lambent slaves! Fiend-cloven tongues! grac'd, once, to shame belief: And make distrust seem virtue!—yet, vain truth! No sooner hears the muse her Poet's call, Than venal calumny whets every sting, To wound his honest purpose. Public sense With her, is private feeling: Satire's frown Mean warmth from disappointment. Spurn the hag: Or, let her err, neglected. Perish warmth, That acts, or wills or thinks from partial pique, Unfaithful to its seemings! Self avaunt! Self is beneath resentment; nor descends The muse, to note such waste of wild impute. Unpersonal, the cheeks indignant glow, That blushes but for others. Fall disgrace On ears, of dastard start, that dare not hear: Or tongues, that dare not own, truth's boldest call! Fall, even, contempt on worth, where, fac'd for scorn, Tort of revulsive brow bids pride withold Thy smile, cheap gratitude! which craft's low guile Oft lends the beggar'd heart, that wants, within. Shame on the painful stretch, that racks the great! Needless extension! dignity like light, Dwells in itself, displayer, undisplay'd. How have I seen the native courtier shine! Warp'd to no sowre sublime, enchant men's eyes; Charm dress'd in easy honour's effluent air: Fill out distinction's voids without pomp's aid, Strike in descending: and attract, supreme! Oh, thou! to whom lost Anna's evening ray Ow'd love's allegiant lustre: flame, of joy, Wit, genius! tide of art! whence letter'd hope Drew depth, to fail ungrounded. Soul of taste! Shade, without chill! soft'ning superior height With access and urbanity!—what need Thy name here added? Day's meridian blaze Marks the known hour, untold.—O, say, best judge, Thou, who so nobly trod'st th' illustrious steep, Oft clouded, since thou left'st it!—Teach th' untaught, Why are the rais'd look'd up to?—'Tis, to try Their claim to sit, so mounted. 'Tis, to task Their strength to lift low climbers. Down, proud snails, That, crawl'd too high, your slime-track'd shells expose! Out with these snuffs in blaze, that shine, to stink! What have the lame to do, with wrestler's toils? 'Tis impudence, that prompts deformity To prink itself, like beauty. Want of light Were flatt'ry, to the ugly. Drag 'em out: And leave 'em, in the eye of scorn, impal'd. These are the minds, that disavow the Muse! Dead to the formful glow, that figures thought, Blots low sensation from the wid'ning heart; Lends an elastic nerve, to every sense: Pushes exerted virtue into act: Feels, for a world embrac'd; and warms mankind. —Nothing of this, poor souls! disturbs their calm. Closing their tortois'd lump of cold content, Distant, perhaps, they hear the poet's name: Less probably, sometimes perhaps, half deign To turn th'untasted page; there, lumb'ring on, Find nothing in the noblest verse, but rhyme: And equal Durfey's frost, to Dryden's fire! Sleep, genius, sleep—the times invite repose. No source, of all Britannia's silv'ry streams, Shall feed hope's with'ring root, where hearts, thus dry, Have drunk, like spunges, fortune's ponded swell: And o'er th' unmoisten'd virtues shake no drop. O, Lycidas! how climbing zeal will lye! Come, help me to deplore those blust'ring gales, Whose ventilative heave puff'd out their void, With shows, of airy ardour: Till up-driv'n O'er skreenful clouds, there burst the bubbly forms! There, shrunk their satiate bulk, to trackless hush! Speak, ye forgotten graces, if unsworn To hold dumb distance, round the seats of power, And rev'rence, un-approaching, step more near: Untarnish those bald stars: tell 'em, their lights Were lent, to be reflected. Every muse, By every art attended, sighing, prone, Complains of interception. Each, in vain, Invokes one beam. But pines, in shiv'ring shade. Why, Lycidas, were ends and means misjoin'd? Why am I born to pain, for pity, will'd? Why chose the God, that warm'd thy widening heart, To curb thy shorten'd hand, and press down fire; What shall we say, to touch these sons of noise With sense, how boldly death dissects their name? What shall we do, to break th' imperious blinds, That rise 'twixt power and taste! to pierce their mist? And teach th'incumbent reeks, what clouds they form? How shall a noteless, nameless, silent, friend To thought's obscure retreats, unnerv'd, like me, By dignity's bold brace, or fame's felt spring, Shake those close groves of state, whence kings catch gloom? Oh! were their reach but thine! or, lot more wish'd, Happier, and safer, most remote from thrones! O, were thy will but theirs!—Then, Lycidas, No self-exposing halt, in place possess'd, Wou'd shame remember'd sweep to distant hope. Corrective care wou'd change, what once it charg'd: Watchful discernment seize unshould'ring worth, That crowds not into notice. Taste wou'd dare Feel uninfus'd distinction: take no cue From int'rests venal nod—less, wait for prayer, From virtue's bashful pang, or art's dumb claim: For, excellence hugs close her modest veil, But, (actively inquisitive for woe, For wit's guess'd wants, for sorrow's cover'd tear, For pains, wrongs, penury of every good, With-held by every evil) drag back weight, That holds down worth depress'd,—and bid it spring. So, cou'd my verse, ah! fruitless dream! inspire, Then shou'd I feel I breathe, nor life's dim track Touch'd languid, lose each footstep's feeble mark, And leave no streak on time, to note my name. —But, hush, vain struggler, bid thy breast contract; And satisfy with will, thy pow'rless soul. How shou'd such lot be mine, who drink wit's dregs, In desarts, where seduction's drowth has choak'd With venal dust, Castalia's dwindled rill! How shall I raise my voice, till greatness hears? Write, says the whisp'ring impulse, that assumes Ambition's airiest hope, yet hates her name: Write, but be read. Write rugged truths, untun'd To flatt'ry's dulcid lentor: roughly loud, As when the last heard call shall wake the dead. Court some kind angels aid, to voice thy theme. Alas! no Angel dwells, where avarice reigns!— Oh! for some hoarse Teutonic note, more stern, Than Runic bard, o'er hostile scalp, e'er sung, When Woden's hall resounded to his clang! Then shou'd satiric fervor, sharply strong, Roar, like the muses's bull, till the wak'd nine Concurr'd, in frightful consort; while intense, Up the steep cliffs of Pindus' pathless brow, Rumbling, I roll'd my tumbril theme along. Wrong not, by numbers tun'd to concord's shell, The brawl-devoted taste, that tans thy times. Softness be Opera's claim: be sharpness thine. Softness in satire asks good sense, in guilt: 'Twere lost, on power's blind puddlers. Wit's light gnat, Humming its courteous buz, is brush'd from note: Her wasp, close-fast'ning, bids th' unlist'ner feel. Sting then: and force from pain, what pride with-holds. So shall thy verse, at least, out-soar contempt; And lend distaste discernment.—Touch no praise. 'Tis idol sacrifice, to gods, of Stone. Praise has but one pleas'd reader: scarce, one friend. Satire can squeeze kind looks, from bitt'rest gall. Loosen the reins to spleen, cries angry truth; Where phlegmful fogs distil their lazy damp 'Tis wholesom to be mad. Nor pause, for thought: Who, that but sees or hears, needs think, for fame? Born, to no past'ral plain's romantic range, Calm, and cool-fann'd by reason's temp'rate gale, Feel, that thou breath'st in passion's haziest fen, Contagious air, by sensual suns, inflam'd: Where carnate emulation, stripp'd of mind, Glows muscularly strong: where license reigns, Uncurb'd by law's restraint: where youth's fed fire, Bids bashful diffidence of self be bold. Where not to rev'rence, is to know, mankind: Where disrespect is ease; noise taste in life; And modesty low breeding. Where descent Drives literally downward: 'till, behold! Yon Coachman's copy'd soul propels the peer; And dim-star slouchers shine, by glare of shame, Downcast decorum swells the public laugh. Judgments and views run backward. Nature nods. Ends but succeed, as means prepost'rous err. Malice grows fast, water'd by pity's tear: And factions but contend, for rank in wrong. Up, from rhyme's popy'd vale; ascend fame's hill: Soft to the soft: Thy theme be tempest—On. Write with a whirlwind's fury. Snatch the God, That thunders in blank verse, to ride thy storm. So may they hear, tho' cricket stakes were pitch'd, Tho' the won Plate's broad triumph shook the field: Tho' cock's, hard-conqu'ring crow, to shouting rings; Or Briton's coarse debates out-quarrel Rome's. —Muse, I begin. Assist, with all your sail, Ye prose-inflating hawks, of Helicon! Lend me your wing's wide stretch, to aid my sweep. Come! let the soul of Freedom's reinless power, Vast, and unconscious of constraint, inspire! Wild let her lift me from the lawns of song, Musick's hedg'd boundlets, mem'ry's measur'd mead's, Where rhyme-trac'd cadence, in harmonious close, Rivets recorded sense, and pins down thought. Light, and disrob'd of softness, let her drive, Loose, to the voids, of fancy's viewless scope: Vague, and unshap'd, and pathless, as the air. What shall be sung? ye sons of vastness, say, What subject, sadly soundful, like the rush Of hoarse, broad, Cat'racts, shall blank numbers roar? Shall it be Sorrow's energetic plaint, That groans away the sun, and lends new gloom To midnight's mournful umbrage? Tim'd too well, Too lately, Albion's boreal wastes had wept The suited theme: when tears, from rash revolt, Wash'd ruthless prisons: when th'accessless wilds Of bleak-brow'd mountains shriek'd, with vocal woe; Mothers and Orphan's cries! whom famine found, Where only famine cou'd: Despair's pale tribe! Weeping, in death's chill grasp, their own unfelt, Some past or future fate, of friend more dear; Why shou'd the gen'rous Muse insult the fall'n? Why not deplore the pangs of hostile pain? Just if they thought their cause, their crime seem'd faith. Guiltless in will, by taste involv'd in wrong, From educative custom's devious warp, Spare the persisting blind: unhoping grace: Trustless of regal virtues: erring on From doubt of mercy. For, alas! no voice Of truth, in desarts heard, had taught 'em, Kings, Who last can fear offence, can, first, forgive. Paint, then, their pity'd anguish: nobly feel, To make sublimely felt, this brave man's test: That hearts, unshaken by resister's rage, Are conquer'd by their sorrow.—Vain attempt! Spread the sonorous wing for flights of joy. Sorrow renounces latitude of range: Dwells in confinement's cave; where thought sits chain'd, Muses are shunn'd: and horror's winking lamp. Ghastlying night's ebon eye, sees woes on woes, Tear following tear, sigh echoing sigh, combin'd, Move in close consonance of sist'ring sound. Shall it be love, soft whisp'ring out the soul, From its own mansion tenderly exhal'd To reach some sweeter self? No: dare not touch That theme; 'tis sacred to the rights of rhyme, Union will ne'er, by dissonance, be sung. Love's links are married couplets: hand in hand The willing yoke-mates share confederate fall: Soft as the zephyr skims the dew-drop'd rose. —But, even had rhyme conspir'd to tempt—forbear. Aweful, resign, a wreath, more nobly won. Saint-John, his country's boast, his country's crime, When courts at leisure left his youth, to love, Saint-John! the Muse's Lord, this theme once sung: Sung it, in verse more soft, than beauty's eye! More strong, than her Attraction! Almahide, Immortal Almahide! by Saint John, lives. Who shall attempt to touch the Theme he chose? He, who was voic'd by musick: mien'd by love! He, who, by turns, has every muse possess'd, And every art, protected: Every grace, Through every fortune, led—Supreme, in all. Saint John! whom woman wish'd, man envied; realms Made war on: yet, whom none found power to hate! Nor grief thy theme, nor love. What choice remains? Shall it be death's grim waste, War's field of fire? Aptlier, the subject wou'd have warm'd our isle, When England's sun shot wide th' irradiate flame Of her fam'd Edward's day-dawn.—Yet, who knows, But at some far-thrown moment, whit'ning broad, Some light, new rising, may (perhaps) once more, Off-roll the sullen shade, that glooms our fame. Rekindling sense of martial fire may glow, Till the rous'd nation blazes. Then, the sons Of Sires unskill'd to think defeat no shame, Starting to destin'd vengeance, the struck drum No more shall bid the form-dress'd soldier sleep: But roll its deepn'ing bass to wake due death; Then too, no more, the trumpets clang'ry shrill, Fright'ning the Opera Dame, shall to her ear Call her affected hand, and shut out claim To promise of a son, like him she loves. Hail the wish'd wonder: give him birth, O time! And into fame's rough ocean launch his name. —But, when he rises, bid him hate no Muse. Fan his impatient blaze, to letter'd love. Pour the enthusiast fervor thro' his ear, That fir'd the conqu'ring Ammons thirsty soul— Born for the poet's praise, teach him to know, That war's wing'd bolt, by love of verse impell'd, Bursts every bar to glory. Verse, to war Lends ardour: War, to verse, new warmth, imparts. So join'd, that never hero reach'd renown: Or, reach'd, ne'er held; who wrong'd the Muse's claim. Oh what, ye gothic renders of the ear! Ye blank verse bursters of Pierian bars! Strong beyond chaining comet; swerves of thought! Giant surmounters of wit's loftiest Alps! Ye hurlers of prose rocks at musick's heaven! What shall deserve the dread, your thunder bears? Faction deserves, and claims it: cries a howl, That paints th' attentive soul—Come, learn her laws. Give, to the deity, that skakes down thrones, Th' allegiance of thy Muse. Blank verse be mine. Guideless and boundless in aspiring grasp, And frownful in majestic sullenness, Her musick dwells in murmur. Let her growl For faction: taste her lust of loud complaint, And hang on empire's wheels the drag of hate. Range safe beneath her standard: mark its sweep! Unfurling into length, the dreadful wave Sees earth's chill'd kingdoms shake, beneath its shade! Kneel, and be Hers: enroll thy name—and rail. Thou start'st!—alas, for verse, that dares, not rail? What can'st thou hope from praise? it wounds no name. Art thou to learn thou liv'st, where greatness hoards Regard, to bribe repugnance? o'er-assur'd, And cheaply negligent of zeal inclin'd. So must it be, where party's billowy surge Bids wave push wave from power. There, science sleeps. Uproar and contest reign. Deep, to the root, Pain-trod Parnassus shakes: and each sap'd sprig, That green'd the muse's grove, finds dry decay. While pelted into fright, or laugh'd to spleen, Deaf ministerial ears, absorb'd in fret; Or dirtily engross'd by craft's low buz, Taste not the calm surveys of leisure's range: Share no delight in song; nor woo, nor weigh, The power, that dwells in gen'rous praise, to guide A nation's doubtful heart, to find her friend. Waste not the warmth of verse on things, like these, Or, stain their mem'ry, with effaceless gall. —Yet, since, sometimes, in power's obscurest night, Through sabley jet, pale threads of white may start, Shou'd vice shame one, to virtue, lend him light. Faction, that loves no truth, must own this, one: That never friend to verse malign'd the just. Virtues, however thankless, forc'd, or few, Compell the poet's praise—But wou'd thy song Wake these sublime insolvents, into sense Of what they owe attachment? Let it rail. Rail horrible: in accents, like their own, When envy's acrimonious rage impells Detraction's venal insult. Nerve, in sounds Like thunder's gath'ring menace, the rais'd arm Of opposition's onset. Tell the press, Where public plunder bawds for private thrift. Where grandeur holds a stalking-horse, to shame, And skreens guilt's aim at honesty. Why laws, Bent and re-bent like wire, crack short, start wide, And, with two ends, bind nothing. Tell whose thirst, By taste unguided, snaps at bubbly froth, And leaves the sapid depth, untouch'd, below: Teach, where bought strength was weakness: wisdom craft: And infamy long due, where chance gave joy. Begin, describe, discolour. Spread abroad Sedition's fluid tints, and stain a state. So, shall attracted notice deign regard, And slander snatch the perquisite of praise. Such are the tastes of office! such, the souls, That actuate half the mighty! Note it, you, Who rev'rence high distinction. This unmark'd, Hope's empty swell plumes broad her feathery crest: But, bald in disappointment, frights belief. Court crocodiles are scal'd: they feel no tweak. He, who wou'd wake must wound: seen danger strikes More forcibly, than all thy Pathos, Wit! Say, Tacitus,—thy skill the secret found: In what state-scale, five hundred insults, poiz'd, Weigh'd down five hundred thanks, in grateful gold. Dream not, thy Roman's genius mov'd such boon: Not his fam'd father's vict'ries, ten times won, And to thy claim transferr'd, had, there, so charm'd. Oh power of prompt reproach, to rasp reward: And flash conception's fire from flint most cold! Call it not bounty: blast it, angry muse; And from the fame of Albion blot that tale. Th' imbitter'd hand of calumny bows down The heart; its gall corrodes, to smile thro' wrongs, And pay compell'd respect, to dreaded scorn: While, on the candid courtship of the kind, No fost'ring glance descends!—untott'ring power Takes compliment, as tribute. Over-cramm'd With self, and surfeiting on brief success, The narrow-compass'd heart wants room, for taste. —Or grant some glimm'ry ray gave light, to guess Th' effect of skill'd applause: what thence, results, But insolent contempt, of aid unsought? The busy breast, that pants, in post hard held, Wants leisure to be grateful: 'Tis the task Of grandeur in disgrace, to thank a friend. So spoke th' inurbane voice. The muse sigh'd sad: Paus'd long, withheld consent; and thus reply'd. Faction is fam'd for falsehood—If she, now, Hints truth, 'tis infamy too poor for verse: Leave it to prose-tongu'd party's cool display— Nor love the measures: nor malign the men. Grant imag'd worth, by erring fancy form'd, Ideal, as the dreamer's empty grasp, Who, suffers, but the shown? unmask'd, and found! What has mistaken candor lost, but faith? When, miscomputing their unsounded swell, Deep'ning proud shallows, thou o'er-rat'st design, And wrong'st the guiltless, by respect undue, Blush, and be dumb: repent; and sin no more. Where, arrogant in virtue, conscious claim Looks cold, on praise consign'd to length'ning time, Or, uninspir'd to judge, reads flat: nor finds Distinction, 'twixt the Bell-man's power, and thine, Smile, and forgive the blind: but, still, be just, Still, be the worth thy theme: the taste thy scorn. And thou, fled soul, of Pope! dis-rob'd from dust, And, in that dust, deposing each faint stain, That speck'd, while here, thy part divine with man! If, from that source of truth, where, now, thou shin'st, Spirits, like thine, look down, and love it, still; Hear, and attest. Sarcastic, as thou wast, All scorn of flatt'ry sleeps not, in thy grave. There lives, who dares assert the poet's fire, Undimm'd by venal smoke. Who boasts no muse: Yet owns the rights of all; and loves their fame. Who, from retreat's safe depth, feels virtue's wounds; Adopts th' impropriate pang, and flies from rest. Who, from the summit point of fortune's spire, There, cou'd his fate stand rais'd, wou'd, touch'd as now, Bow prostrate, as the worm, to hail the wrong'd; Then greatest, when most lessen'd! by false fears, From envy's miscreant arts, and stripp'd of name! And you, whoe'er you are, where-e'er you pine, Who glow, perhaps, unmark'd, perhaps, o'erlook'd, Perhaps, untasted, by sublime defect Of dignity in sense; which kings may want, But none, 'midst all his titles, can bestow: Grieve not to seem too little to the great. What lose the gen'rous, who profusely waste, On high-plac'd weakness, all the muse's strength? Shines the sun faintlier, for those beams he pours, Vain, and unthank'd, to warm th' insensate rock? Tell the big blanks, that he, who courts neglect, And loves to praise, unpaid, is paid within. Is greater, than the great: pities their scorn: And bids their merit live; by verse they wrong'd. The Excursion of FANCY: A Pindaric Ode. I. And why, ye empty names of things, unsound! Ye almost shadows, e'en, of sound! Fame! Glory! Fortune! Fate! and all the fairy fancy'd round: Or rather wou'd ye, but vouchsafe to tell The cause of ills, ye know too well; Say? ye proud tracers of disdainful state; Who buy distinction at the world's low rate! Ye mean aspirers to be great: By aims, which earth-born hopes, not heavenly truths, create! Why must the sacred spring of honour's flood, Be us'd to rince the dusty robes of pride, With blood, and purple, doubly dy'd? Why foully trampled in, by wealth's bold feet? Why, there, must lep'rous vices meet? And, why must poverty, however sweet, And naked innocence, unstain'd, and neat, Be, rudely, driv'n away: or, terribly, withstood, By giant forms! chimeras, stain'd with blood! Who, dreadful, stalk about, within,—and raise th' uncleanly mud? II. Say, coward learning! long, too long, misled! If, yet, thou dar'st erect thy dizzy head! And art not, yet, heart-conquer'd quite, By power and custom join'd; too, too unequal fight! If, yet, once more, thou dar'st assert thy eyes, Once more, undazled, view Truth's beamy skies; And can'st, with strong, unstagg'ring sight, Firm-fix'd, in steddy gaze, take in the o'erwhelming light! Say, nor fear th' oppressive hate, Which truth, told plainly, must create! The foes of truth, in bulk, tho' great, Lifted boldly, want, in weight! Say, to what sad cause, we owe, That naked virtue must, regardless go! Or, shiv'ring stand, in fortune's snow: Till chance does some gay mantle, o'er her, throw, And notice does not, from her worth, but her adornments, flow? Immortal heav'n! if man may dare Climb thither, to refresh his care! What means our God! when he requires, That man, in virtue's rugged paths, shou'd tread, If, to blessings, he aspires? And yet, strange paradox! permits, to virtue's foes, The mounts of power, from whence to aim their blows: And hurl red ruin down, in surer throws, With levell'd malice, nicely pois'd, to hit the climbing head, While they sit safe, and laugh, above, to see th' aspirer dead! III. Why?—If reasons may be giv'n To earth, for laws, which pass in heav'n! Why am I doom'd to toil, with vain desire? Be ever climbing, and yet, never, higher? Why am I curs'd, with scenes of helpless woe, Which, since to cure, I must not reach the pow'r, Why am I not permitted—not to know? Why feels not yon proud lord his share, Of my heart-piercing care, For suff'rings, I can neither help, nor which my bus'ness are? Why sleep princes, void of pain, For those sad thousands, who complain; And wash, with tears, their deep-dy'd grief, in vain? These men could lend compassion, hands, to reach The sinking mis'ries, which their help beseech! I, who my own misfortunes cannot cure, With barren sorrow, other men's endure! While they, whose smiles might heal, and voice might chear, Have eyes, and cannot see!—have ears, and will not hear? IV. 'Tis wond'rous strange, all this!—But, man should never gaze, With search, too curious, on the mystic ways, Which form the soul-bewild'ring maze! It is enough for us, that there must be Ends in this, we cannot see! And, since 'tis vain, to tug at fate, With unavailing, human weight, Let us throw down this load of doubt, with which no race is won: And, swift, to easier conquests, lighter, run, The way, which reason is not bid to shun! Let us, with never-yielding courage, strive, In spite of villany, to thrive! And, from our resolution's spring, long streams of bliss derive! Like the gay ball, struck down, still higher, let us rise, And, obstinate, dispute th' unwilling prize! Rebound, with ten-fold-vigour, at each blow! And, that to wounds, we may a victory owe, Antæus like, spring fresh, from ev'ry throw: 'Till short-breath'd fortune, tir'd, and sick, with our unthought defence, At once, permits us, to enjoy, both her, and innocence. V. Well, then! resolve we!—Be it so: Further thought we shall not need: That we set forward, stands decreed! But, hold! what journey shall we chuse to go? I will embark me, on yon boundless sea! The sea of Knowledge! proud! imperious store! Of heaven-assaulting waves, which gnaw the shore, On ev'ry side, with hungry roar! Yet, always, gaping, always, swallowing more, Still flows, forever, and will flow—voracious, as before! Well! I am sail'd!—I plow the foamy deep, And, now, my climbing vessel mounts, on high, And, now, I sweep the starry sky! And, now! stand firm, my brain! rush down the wat'ry steep! Ah, me! half-founder'd now, in vain, all arts I try! This way, and that, immortal heaven! I drive! Currents, encount'ring currents, strive! The fruitless rudder, ill-obey'd, in vain, Struggles, oppress'd, against the madding main, Eddies cross eddies whirl!—and whelm it back, again! VI. Hold! I am sick! I'll sail, no more: Pilot, give thy labours o'er! Put in, and seek repose, on yonder peaceful shore. Where am I, now?—'Tis wond'rous dark, all round! What means this shadow-cover'd ground! This is the land of Ignorance, wild, and rude; Bleak, comfortless and bare: A dreary soil! an empty air! By shadowy nothings, I am, here, pursued; And gape, and yawn, and tire, in sleepy solitude! Let me turn, which way I will, Sight has narrow quarters still! Scarce, can I see, above a fathom round; I tread, on soft, and sandy ground! At ev'ry step, I take, my feet sink in; Already I, to fear I know not what, begin! Hark! what strange noise is that, which whistles round my head? Ghosts, and gobblings, this way tread! Astonish'd eyes! what scenes about me draw! Now, stagg'ring reason! where's thy law? My soul grows weak, with childish awe: Fancy has courage captive led; Empty somethings, still, I dread! Ha! see!—at once, what objects rise!—How horribly they spread! I trod, too loud, and with the noise, have wak'd the silent dead. VII. Fly—fly, night-wand'ring feet! explore lost day, If this the land of ignorance be, I'll drive, again, on learning's sea! Here, I dare no longer stay! And, yet, I see not, how to get away! What's this?—methinks, I see the rushy brink Of some deep current, in my way! Help, help me, fortune! or, I sink! Now I am in! whelm'd o'er amidst the flood! Ha? tho' the chance was bad, th' effect, is good! It is not water this, but fluid mud. Stagnate, and thick, the sleepy depth—I tread, with unhop'd ease! And, now, I see the land, again; and, now, The liquid field I, up, before me, plow: Wade out, and climb the bank, by slow degrees! I've 'scap'd the lake, thank heav'n! but all this while, I wander, guideless, in the same dark isle! What's this, which wou'd be thought a wind? Which heaves, by sluggish fits, the drowsy air! Which creeps, in broken murmurs, far behind, And, idly, seems to slumber, in its care! Now, swells, in sudden gusts,—now does, at once, asswage? Like drunken men, who strive to talk, but sleep amidst their rage. Curse on this soul-condensing solitude! This land of ignorance appears as rude, And far more dangerous, these unactive ills, Than all the busy-frightfulness, which fills Yon sea, where storms my devious bark pursued! Tell me, then, directive star! Thou, that guid'st me, from a-far! If Learning's voyage is not safe to take; And Ign'rance, dreadful shore! I, now, forsake, What more inviting land, my next look-out shall make? VIII. I see, methinks, far off, a sudden glare! Ha! look—a mountain rises to the sea! From which, ten thousand flames, shot thro' the air Spread circling brightness wide, to such degree, That a kind trail of light darts, outward, ev'n, to Me! Bless'd with this glorious, unexpected, guide, I look about me, now, with pride! And, lo! a narrow Causeway thither leads! Narrow, indeed, it is, and seems to show, That few shou'd, hence, to yon gay mountain go! Care, and diligence, there needs; For ev'ry tott'ring step, I stumble so, That, scarce, I 'scape the waves, which foam, and break, below! Wou'd I had never landed, on this shore; This Causeway is a dangerous passage o'er, And I was nearer, to the mount, before, When my bark miss'd its sight, amidst the ocean's roar! Courage, my soul! I shall, anon, be there! I know the country, now, as I draw near: It is the far-fam'd realm of war! How red the skies, about it, are! Oh! let me climb the cliffy steep, and strike yon topmost star! IX. Thank heaven! my aking foot has reach'd the strand: What's this? the earth is iron; and sulphur all the sand. Instead of air, here's smoke;—but flame does light supply! And, from within, where, strongly fed, they lie, Torrents of fiery day break up, and streak the sooty sky! Hark! as up the hill I go, From the wide top, huge, full-mouth'd thunders roar, While far, within, and more below, Hoarse, infant noises, faintly, blow; And slowly rising, more and more, Grumble, in horrid notes, their new-taught lessons o'er! Some, the shrill trumpet imitate, and some Buffet unskill'd, the sullen drum! Thro' my astonish'd ear, harsh-mingling pass The sound of bells, clash'd swords, and clatt'ring brass! Loud-neighing horses, storms of vollied shot! Shouts, groans, and words, confounded all, heard, but distinguish'd not, Well! I am up, at last! and, now I'm, here; Let me look round, and see, how things appear! Oh! my glad soul!—what prospects open, there! My hope-enlivening heart to chear? Now, I am in my wish'd, my proper, sphere! What is there, in yon far-ken'd world, which, hence, we may not share? Oh, heaven! what false appearance dwells, below! How is man deceiv'd, by show! Yon Viceroys (as they wou'd be thought) of fate! Yon poppet-managers of state! Those things, which bid life-wasting followers wait For bubbles, which, at jewel's price, they rate; And puff, and swell, with empty pride—and call themselves, the great! Ye stars!—How humbly they all look this way! As, who wou'd seem to say;— Great Sirs! permit us, still, to cheat the fools, with whom we play! They turn, to us, the cringing side, and strut the other way! X Soul, recline! and take thy ease! Look about thee, by degrees; The prospect's wide enough, to please! Since the commanding top is, thus, attain'd, Use, with care, th' advantage gain'd! What wilt thou do? that, thus, I feel thee swell! In struggling silence loves design to dwell? Or, are thy views, too vast, to tell? Go on, form boldly; swift, resolve,—and execute it, well! Send out Fancy, she can fly! Nimbly-wing'd, her own best spy: Every danger, e'er drawn nigh, Th' air-footed Amazon discerns; and scatters, with her eye! Fancy! then, proud Goddess rise! From earth extend thy stretching size! And push thy active head, thro' the discover'd skies! Stamp, ambitious, with thy foot, And bid the threat'ned world look to't! For thou hast mighty work to do, and power enough to do't. Grasp yon escaping earthquake, 'twou'd depart; Blow new vigour, to its heart! Take it, and give the lazy globe a shake! And, when scar'd nature's broad awake, All her coy aid demand, and take! Break open ev'ry inmost part! Thro' all the gloomy chasms of matter dart! Let in light, to find out art! And smile, to see the blaze-shot nymph, with sudden wonder, start! Sieze her, quickly, bind her fast! Distant else, behind her cast; A thousand mazy turnings, first, must tediously be past. XI. Doubly arm'd, and seated, thus, Who is, now, a match for us? Begin! begin! the glorious task! Descend, at once, and strip yon kings, of power's ill-painted mask! Tell 'em, they the nymph disgrace! Power should wear a lovely face: And, hideously, to hide her charms, is horrible, and base! Bid 'em, in empire's masquerade, elbow no more for place, But, bravely, dare put on, plain truth, and scorn a borrow'd face. Are they disturb'd?—Is all the hive, in arms? See! they buz in hostile swarms! But, 'tis no matter, let 'em bring Hoarded malice, in their sting: They cannot pierce, much less displume, the pinions of thy wing! What is that, they seek to know? What commission we can show! Tell me, Fancy! was it so? Commissions, say, are, sometimes, forms, which men, to custom, owe; A shape of power, which tyrants steal, and, having stol'n, bestow. Yet, to please 'em, be they told, From higher hands, than theirs, we hold! From justice, truth, and reason, say; That great triumvirate of power!—which they Pretend, and but pretend, t'obey! This our authority! and, if these not suffice, We can show 'em large supplies Of vengeance, force, and stubborn will: our sworn auxilaries! Now, they tremble; now, they mourn! Now, with helpless rage, they burn! Well may they rave, indeed, to see their friends against 'em turn. XII. Stay! and, e'er we farther go, Let our great meaning be aloud proclaim'd! Our deeds shall be as just, as fam'd! Friends, and enemies shall know, Why we make war; and what we mean to do! Herald vengeance! swift arise! Shell, with steel, thy flinty heart! And since, by nature, blind thou art; Bury thy lifted hand, in yonder skies, And pluck two comets, down, to serve for eyes, Dawb thy dismal face with blood! And, with extensive stride, crossing the trembling flood! Of fire-embroider'd smoke, throw on a wind-shook robe, And shoot thy shadow over half the globe! In thy right hand, lift quiv'ring light'nings high! Hardly held, and mad to fly! From thy rais'd left, let heaven's loud bolt be hurl'd; And roll th' alarming thunder round the world! When wak'd attention pricks her frighted ear, And stalking apprehension pants, with fear! When all the starting nations, upward, look, By convulsive horror shook! Borrow the northern wind's big voice, and then! Three times pronounce, O yes! and, thus, address the sons of Men! XIII. Hear, ye people! far, and wide! Reason's force will, now, be try'd! Tremble, ye Tyrants! at the near defence, Of long-oppress'd and helpless Innocence. Where is the wretch, who deep-entrench'd, in State, Impiously, defies his fate! And dares be wicked, without bounds, because immensely great? Him, let injur'd Virtue show! And we proclaim ourselves his foe! Fortunate usurpers, quake! Let the forc'd thrones, whose seats, uncall'd, ye take, Beneath your pond'rous ruin shake! Or, let 'em swell, to throw you out: or, with your fortunes, break: Rapine, disguised in law! oppression, arm'd with wealth! Rock-hearted cruelty, and scornful pride! Hear! and tremble, when ye know, We, the great healers, bring th' unhappy—health! And draw the thorn, from virtue's bleeding side. Ye sap-engrossing weeds, which but for mischief grow! Pay plunder'd excellence, ye slaves! the vast arrears, you owe, Or, we pronounce ourselves your mortal foe. Wisdom, knowledge, justice, art, Peace, meekness, truth, and sanctity of heart! Discourag'd industry! unfriended grief! Charity! gentleness! and, to be brief, Each weeping Virtue, that deserves, and has not found relief! March, and join us; we are friends! What, tho' your numbers are but few? Our muster's well-weigh'd strength attends! Where show is wanting, substance makes amends! We, your allies, can lend you arms—and give you courage, too! XIV. They come! from ev'ry part, they, gathering fly! But, trembling, backward cast a doubtful eye! Astonish'd, at the hostile swarms, which, round 'em shad'wing, lie! Safety! from silent caves arise! Yon crystal pillar, from heaven's palace, break, And cope it down to our Allies! 'Twill a glitt'ring Causeway make! So! they are past! encamp 'em, on th' ascent! Stretch out the bright divisions, line by line! Unfold our milky ensigns to the wind! Draw the battalions down, in just extent; And bid the iron face of battle shine! What's this! the rash audacious, foe, Far from fear, and mad with pride, Scorns to wait a threaten'd blow; And this way turns invasion's tide! They will not stay, it seems, to be a second time defy'd! They weigh! they sail! they spread! from ev'ry part; Numbers, following numbers, start! Their navies hide the sea, thro' which they sweep; And th' o'er-labour'd wind, grown sick, at heart, After the flagging canvass seems to creep; And groans, behind, oppress'd with weight, so strong, That puffing storms, with cheeks half-burst, scarce push it slow along. XV. 'Tis worth our wonder, Fancy! since we are Possess'd, at once, of the whole realm of war; Whence, those prodigious Magazines shou'd spring, Which nations, ill-ally'd, do, thus, against us, bring! At times, exported hence, at first, they went, Like naval stores, from Christendom, to Barbary rovers sent: And hoarded long, to be, at last, ill spent, Come, now, against their Mother's bosom bent! Since it is thus, we'll diff'rent arms prepare, Our terrors shall new, unknown, habits wear: And, like our Cause, our weapons, too, shall huge advantage bear! Nature, our confederate found; And Proteus' art our captive bound; What force can earth, against us, bring, which these shall not confound! Hear! thou tall forest! from thy loos'ning root, Hither, thy piny offspring shoot! And thou, proud host of gloom-arresting Oak! Through whose close ranks, the day's light horse ne'er broke, With reverend awe, confess the mighty call! Nod consent,—and, groaning, fall! Now, swift, together rush again, and, once more closer, join, With animated, sympathetic, twine: Embrace, at once, and new in form, with concave beauty shine! Descend, compleat, and plow the flood, in naval-bodied line! Scorn the help of canvass wings! Art shall lend self-moving springs! Your active forms shall never need, attend the humorous wind: Self-oar'd, with spoky fins, your furrowing keels, Shall dash the billows back, with living wheels: And striking, swiftly, every mark, design'd, Sweep on, thro' winds, and tides, averse, and leave the gales, behind. XVI. Mountain! open thy hot breast; thy iron sinews strain! Bleed, at every nit'rous vein! Yawn horrible! and, with convulsive pains, Burst thy flame-lab'ring head! and shoot thy mineral brains! Take 'em, art! and mix 'em well! Thou can'st the dark proportions tell! Let death the bitter kernel be, and forge thou thick the shell! Kindle a fire, like lightning, blue! And, that its dreadful work, it may, unerring, do, Breathe a living spirit thro', And give the deadly compound sight, and force, and swiftness, too! Take this new, gigantic, mould; And, by it, form such tubes, as may befit The mass, which their impregnate wombs must hold! Ram their greedy throats with it; And teach new thunders, to out-mouth the old! Hold! It not suffices, yet! Not one advantage shall the proud foe boast; 'Tis not enough, that victory we get, Unless the gain is ours, with nothing lost! Bid yon aërial substance shed its down; Spin it thick, and weave it strong! Draw out the force-repelling texture long! And, with it, fence each vessel round, like some well bulwark'd town; Now, we are proof against their gather'd Pride, Be all their batteries, on us, hourly, try'd! Breathless, and dead, their fruitless force, shall kiss our soft'ned side. XVII. Embark! ye well-appointed few, embark! Put out, and meet the number-trusting foe! Their circling fleet has made the day look dark, And seems, in sable dress'd, to mourn the coming blow! Rush against 'em—gore 'em through! Bear 'em down, beneath the sea! As weeds before the furrowing plow, torn up, and buried be! If, while, onward, ye pursue, On either side, they flank ye, too; At once, clear all your thunder's dreadful throats, And roar destruction out, in passant notes! 'Tis done! and, gloriously, the banish'd day, Which, late, their gloomy squadrons chas'd away! Restor'd, triumphant, shines with tenfold light: Their curling ruin shines to heaven, and makes the sun more bright! See! see! mark well this scene, recording fame! The hissing ocean toils, with vain desire, To quench, with spouting waves, the batt'ling flame; But scorch'd, with clinging heat, and mad with shame, Does every way, at once, in blazing tides, retire, And, flying, frights th' astonish'd world, with floods of liquid fire. Pride-swol'n oppression, now, hot vengeance feels; Their falling flags blush deep, in blood! And hide their shame, within the flood! Their masts turn downward, and th' uplifted keels Float, reverse, with wave-wash'd reels! And all th' extended strength, but now, so proudly gay, Like snow-top'd fields, o'er-run by fire, melts all, at once, away. XVIII. Whither shall we, now, proceed? Turn your Heads, to yon white shore; Follow fortune, still, with speed, Ye, who wou'd engage her more! It matters nothing, what we, now, have done: Or, vict'ry must be well pursued, or, she is never won. Ha! what means yon open'ing scene? The warlike land is gilded o'er, With glitt'ring arms, in distant marches, seen, And graceful troops, that edge the guarded shore! And, from behind, to close us up, between, A huge half moon, of naval strength, Stretch'd, in gay, and pompous length, Advances on us, slow, and well assur'd: These cannot of the number be, who, late, such loss endur'd! Mark the impatient haste of those, behind! As if o'erjoy'd an Enemy to find; Their wanton streamers lash the lazy wind! And, like their genius, hov'ering in the air! See! That glorious something, there! Which does a form unusual seem to bear; Moving awful; looking kind: Now, glides before, to light 'em on; now, chears 'em up, behind. In shape a Lion, fierce, and strong it seems, But, like some figure fancy-form'd, that fills mens active dreams; An Eagle's Talons, and keen bill, it dreadful seems to bear; An Eagle's broad, and shad'wy wings, direct it thro' the air! XIX. Observe! what's he! who solemnly severe, With grave, and awful Sense of majesty, Hemm'd with reverence does appear! Whose eye so piercing seems to be! Whose forehead wears Beneficence, to temper dignity! Who marches, stately, down yon hill, to see! But not to see, with fear! To look, and judge, what we may be! Ye powers! where are we?—How did fancy steer? I know the hero, now he draws more near! How came we, blindly, thus to touch a shore, Thus, hostilely, a land explore, Where heaven does only blessings store! Where wailing sorrow shall be heard, no more, Nor virtue e'er, in vain, the help of power implore! Away! heave anchor! we've no business, here! Yet stay! divinely led, I err, th' unmeant good to blame! Inspir'd, at once, I see, and own, 'twas heaven's unerring aim! Hail! immortal son of fame! Take these legions, they are thine! With, theirs, thy navy shall, resistless join: And virtue's squadrons, led by thee, o'er earth's whole surface shine Root out oppression, wheresoe'er she grows, Let stubborn tyranny fall dead, beneath thy pond'rous blows! And, over all the wide-watch'd world, leave innocence no foes. HOR. Lib. I. ODE XXII. Integer vitæ. Sinless, and sound, the bold good liver dares, Nor needs the Moor's keen javelin, or his bow; No quiver, charg'd with latent deaths he bears, Where pointed poisons glow. Safe, o'er the quicksand's foamy shoals he rows; Safe, every wild of Caucasus surveys: Or, where thy fabled stream, Hydaspes, flows, Dreadless of danger, strays. Once, o'er Sabinum's forest's silent shade, Wand'ring, the charms of Ælia's eyes, I sung: A Wolf, out-starting, where, unarm'd, I stray'd, Listen'd, and backward sprung. Yet, fiercer savage never rang'd the glades Of warlike Daunia's oak-abounding plains, Nor paw'd the Lion's patrimonial shades, Where Juba's offspring reigns. Thence though expos'd to bleaks, where nothing blooms, Where never bud unfolds, to let in spring; But one, long winter's dayless midnight glooms, Black as the Raven's wing. Hence—tho' an outcast, to the sun's lost heat, Houseless, and screen'd by no kind cavern's shades, Still wou'd I love that face, whose smile so sweet, A tongue, still sweeter aids! HOR. Lib. I. ODE V. Quis multâ gracilis. Cool, within the Grotto toying, Soft, on scatter'd roses laid, What young bud art thou destroying? Why, to day, those charms display'd? Trimly pain, in subtle sweetness, What fond heart is, here, beset? Why, with negligent completeness, Loosely curls that tressy net? Soon, by sufferings, taught to know thee, O! ye changeful Gods! he crys, Too, too light, thy falsehoods show thee, Late, the fond believer's wise: Then, with foolish wonder, starting, He compares thy sunshine, past, With those storms of spleen's preparing, Which thy present looks o'ercast! Silly truster! vain supposer! In his am'rous, empty, mind, Soft he forms thee joy's disposer: Ever grateful, hush'd, and kind. Out alas! and shame upon thee! Little dreams he what a sky, Heaping clouds in whirlwinds on thee, Soon shall dim thy future eye. Pity, Gods! those faithful creatures, Yet, unbroke to woman's arts: Fondly trusting lovely features, And for smiles, exchanging hearts. As for me, by heaven befriended, Long ago, I 'scap'd the storm: Safe, with all my sails extended, Flying from that fraudful form: Broad, my pictur'd story, flaming, Now shall Love's gay temple grace: From some pillar's height, proclaiming Warnings, to the rising race. HOR. Lib. I. ODE XX. Vile potabis. Born to be the plain man's friend, Come, and to his taste descend; In temperate draughts, from cans for household use, Drink lean Salinum's healthful juice. 'Tis thin, and hard—but, ah! Mæcenas knows, What aid from strength, to pitied weakness flows: I, my great patron, lending Grecian lees, Taught the sweeten'd Sharp to please: 'Twas Mæcenas—let me, stay— Ay! 'twas done, on that dear day, When the voic'd Theatric player Hail'd, so loud, your entrance, there, That the shout's applausive roar Reach'd your river's distant shore Whence the Etrurian echo's sound, (Meeting Rome's, and circling round) Town and country votes to join, Shook both Alps and Appenine. Light, unbodied Sabine fits, Careless hearts, and shallow wits: Strength of brain, indeed, like yours, Deeper, mightier, growths endures: Dares the Cæcubanian bowl; Drains Calenum's flowing soul: I, of weaker head, decline Politician's potent wine: No Falernian's mingled flow Bids my blushing Bacchus glow: Not a single jar I fill, Formia, from thy factious hill! Safe, and sober, here, I drink, Steer no state—but sing, and think.</field>
