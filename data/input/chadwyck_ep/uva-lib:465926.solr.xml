      <field name="fulltext">Numb. I. The Norwich Lady: OR, The Deceiv'd Fryers. A Tragi-Comedy. In pious Days when brawny Monks Turn'd Maids to Nuns, and Nuns to Punks, And when Religion more than Law Kept all the slavish Croud in awe, At Norwich then there liv'd a Knight Who did in Feats of Arms delight, And in the Wars had born Command When the Fifth Henry rul'd the Land: This Valiant Knight, whose Fame and Glory Will ever live and shine in Story, Had chosen such a beauteous Wife To grace his House and bless his Life, That none could gaze upon her Charms, And not desire her in his Arms; For e'ery Feature in her Face Invited to another Place, And tempted all who look'd upon her, To wish themselves more nigh her Honour. But Madam being truly Chast, Or thought so by the World at least, Was much too Vertuous to be naught, Or else too cunning to be caught; For none were ever heard to say, She step'd aside or run astray. The Knight being tir'd with Wounds and Scars, And having quite forsook the Wars, Was now resolv'd at home to tarry, And live as Men should do that marry; That is, to mind no other Blisses, But Pious Prayers and Nuptial Kisses, And to divide his happy Life Betwixt Religion and his Wife; And that his Worship might attone For the past Evils he had done, A Church he built, that all might see His pious Zeal and Charity: Near to the same he rear'd a small Religious House, which held in all Twelve Fryers and a ruling Pastor, Call'd Abbot, to preside as Master. Among this lazy Crew that fed Full twice as often as they pray'd, Were two who never could agree, But liv'd in open Enmity, Making themselves the snarling Jest, And daily Maygame of the rest; The Name and Title of the one B'ing Frier Richard, t'other John, Both pamper'd Gluttons, fitter far T'attend a Dray, or load a Car, Than to exhaust their Days in Cloisters, O'er Holy Beads and Pater-nosters. The charming Lady of the Founder, Whose Beauty merited such Wonder, Being not only Fair without, But, like her pious Sex, devout, Kept close to Vespers, Mass, and Mattins, To pray, and shew her Silks and Sattins. Now, you must know, my Lady's way To Church thro' the same Convent lay, Where Am'rous John stood always ready To view and bow unto my Lady, Who, in return, would give a smile, Not dreaming he could be so vile, Who thus profess'd a Holy Life, To Lust for's Benefactor's Wife; And therefore was at all times civil, Not thinking either Flesh or Devil Could tempt a Frier to so much Evil. But John, who fancy'd that he spy'd Some Hopes when he my Lady ey'd, And that her Curtesies and Smiles Were Female Shoing-Horns and Wiles, Made use of with a kind intent, To give his Love encouragement, Thought himself now cocksure of what He greatly wanted to be at, In case he could but frame or find An opportunity to's Mind: He therefore thought there was no better A Method, than to write a Letter; Accordingly he sat him down, First scratch'd his Ears and then his Crown, And next in ample Form set forth His Passion and my Lady's Worth, Declaring that he soon must dye, Unless her Honour would comply, T'extinguish, by her kind embrace, The Flames sh'ad kindled with her Face. This Letter, by her trusty Maid, Was to my Lady's Hand convey'd, Who reading o'er the lushious Lines, And finding Frier John's Designs, Paus'd like a Woman of Discretion, 'Twixt Fear and Female Inclination, As if she wish'd it no Offence, To pleasure his Concupiscence; But dread of Damning and of Shame, At last prevailing o'er the Dame, So fortify'd her vertuous Breast, Against her Lovers bold Request, That she determin'd to disclose The Frier's Letter to her Spouse, Not knowing but the same might be A Trick to try her Chastity; Accordingly toth' Knight she flies, Feigning a very deep surprize, And laid before him, in a Passion, The Frier's bold Solicitation, Backing the same with all the shews Of detestation she could use, And such Resentments that might fire The Knight, and raise his Fury higher. No sooner had her Spouse perus'd The Letter but it so confus'd His Thoughts, that he the Priory curs'd, Where such Ingratitude was nurs'd, And vow'd to be reveng'd upon That lustful Polecat Frier John, Repenting what he'd built and given To Rogues, more fit for Hell than Heaven. The Knight, whose jealous Indignation Was now past all pacification, Enjoin'd his Wife to send the Frier An Answer to his Heart's desire, Appointing him a certain Night To Feast and Revel in Delight, Pretending that her Spouse must be Then absent of necessity, And that about the Hour of Eight, Herself at the Back-door would wait, To lead him up a private Way Into the Chamber where she lay, That he might cool his am'rous Fire, And gratify his fond Desire. This joyful News so work'd upon The Fancy of young Frier John, That he could think of nothing less Than her soft Lips and kind Embrace, And all those Pleasures and Delights With which young Lovers bless their Nights; Therefore, that he might be more ready To entertain so fair a Lady, He fed till he could eat no longer, That's brawny Back might be the stronger; And drank like any thirsty Farmer, To make his odious Lust the warmer; New shav'd his Noddle, wash'd his Feet And other Parts with Herbs most sweet; Perfum'd his Night-Cap and his Shirt, Bought fine on purpose for the Sport, Lest courser should offensive be Toth' tender Skin of Quality. So common Punks, tho' foul within, And poor withal, delight to sin In costly Linen soft and clean. When John had thus refresh'd his Back With Holland, fit for the attack, And the appointed happy Hour Was come, he santer'd tow'rds the Door, Where the fair Lady in the dark Stood waiting to receive her Spark. No sooner did the Fri'r approach So near that she his Hand could touch, But Madam, with a Heart most hollow, In a soft whisper bid him follow, Leading the Monk, who only thought Of Kisses, Hugs, and God knows what, Into a close and private Room, Where Servants seldom us'd to come. But soon as he was thus decoy'd By her he hop'd to have enjoy'd, In rush'd the furious Jealous Knight, And his Man Roger, with a Light, Both falling rashly, in their Ire, Upon the poor defenceless Frier, Soon brought him headlong to the Floor, And strangl'd him outright, before He could have time to call or howl For Mercy on his sinful Soul. Thus he that will pursue the sweets Of Sin, the bitter often meets. No sooner had the angry Knight Appeas'd his Rage by this Exploit, But he began to think upon The heinous Evil he had done; For rash Revenge, we always find, Brings Terror and Remorse behind; Strange Apprehensions fill'd his Head, When once he saw the Frier dead; And all his jealous Heat and Madness, Were now turn'd into Fear and Sadness; The odious Crime of shedding Blood, The Shame and Danger that pursu'd, The forfeiture of Goods and Life, The Scandal brought upon his Wife, And other frightful Thoughts possest His Brain and terrify'd his Breast; For nought but Ruin now could be Th'effect of a discovery; Therefore the conscious Knight began To think of Measures with his Man, Such that if laid and manag'd right, Might keep the Murder from the Light. At length the Knight a Motion made, That when the Convent were in Bed, The Frier's strangl'd Corps should be Remov'd into the Monastry, Which only by a Garden Wall Was parted from his Worship's Hall. The Man b'ing pleas'd, and well affected To what his Master had projected, Soon thought of where a Ladder stood To perfect a Design so good, Which if attended with Success, Might save their Necks in this distress; So that their greatest Hopes and Trust Were now in what they fear'd the most. By this time all was hush and still, And dark according to their Will; No starry Spark above their Heads, The Friers snoring in their Beds, His Worship's Servants gone to rest, And all things happ'ning for the best, That both concluded this to be The only opportunity; So that the Knight laid Frier John Athwart the Shoulders of his Man, Who, Porter-like, convey'd his Load Toth' place 'gainst which the Ladder stood, And, climbing up the same, let fall The Monk on t'other side the Wall; Then striding on the Cope he drew The Ladder up, with much ado, And turn'd that gently over too, So downwards went the self-same way, To move the Frier from whence he lay, Lest being found in that Condition, So near the Wall, might give Suspicion, That the poor Monk had been destroy'd Abroad, and drop'd from t'other sides The Bearer therefore made a shift To give his Burthen t'other lift, And very prudently thought fit To fix him on the Bog-house Seat, Making the Frier's Arm a prop, Against a Gice, to keep him up, There leaving him, that they might see, I'th' Morn, what the Event would be. The Man, tho' pleas'd he'd plac'd the Monk Where he alive had often stunk, Felt, notwithstanding, much disorder, About so barbarous a Murder, Which, as he climb'd from out the Yard, Caus'd him to fancy that he heard The strangl'd Monk, or something worse, Mounting behind him at his Arse, Which made him, 'twixt a Leap and Fall, At once descend from off the Wall, Leaving the Ladder bolt upright Behind him, in a stinking Fright, Running to's Master to declare With what Success, and how, and where He'd plac'd the Fri'r in such rare order, That none could think he dy'd by murder, But rather perish'd as he sat At Stool, performing you know what, By Chollick Pains, or by too large A griping Outlet or Discharge, Or grunting, parted with his Soul, In labour of a costive Stool. The Master, who was well content With trusty Roger's Management, Long'd, with Impatience, now to see How fortunate th'event would be: Nor could he rest for fear he shou'd Be brought to answer Blood with Blood; But tattl'd with his Man about The Murder, dreading 'twould come out, And that a Rope and Gallow Tree Their fatal Punishment would be. During the time the conscious Knight Was thus reflecting, in a fright, Upon the black and heinous Crime Committed by his Man and him, Fri'r Richard, who had long profess'd Much hatred unto John deceas'd, Was in a griping loose surprise, At Midnight, forc'd from Bed to rise, To give the stinking Thunder vent, That in his rumbling Guts was pent, And running down into the Yard, As the Clouds broke and Moon appear'd, He saw some Brother on the Seat, As the Dutch call it, Plumping neat, Which made him labour to restrain The Dregs that forward press'd with Pain, Till t'other, who had got possession, Was pleas'd to make a Resignation: But Richard seeing that he staid Beyond all reason, beg'd and pray'd The sitting Monk, that he'd be pleas'd To rise, and let his Gripes be eas'd, For that he car'd not to defile The cleanly Yard with nasty Soil; But finding that he neither stir'd, Nor answer'd him one civil Word, And guessing by the Light o'th' Moon, The sullen Lout was Frier John, He then began to rave outright, Because he thought 'twas done in spight, And snatching up a Brick or Stone, No matter which, I'm sure 'twas one, He lent the Fri'r, who sat at rest, A Blow so violent on the Breast, That down he tumbl'd on the Floor Head foremost, tow'rds the Boghouse-Door, And gave his Noddle such a stroak Against the Groundcel made of Oak, Enough to've kill'd him o'er and o'er, In case he'd not been slain before: As soon as Frier Richard found His Brother Monk upon the Ground, Conscious o'th' Mischief he had done, He did to his assistance run, And strove with all his Strength and Might, To set him on his Legs upright, But found him, to his great surprise, So dead he could not move or rise, Concluding that the Blow he'd given, Had sent his Brother's Soul to Heaven; Thus scar'd, he took a turn or two I'th' Yard, consid'ring what to do, And by what Measures he might hope To save his Gullet from the Rope: At length, the pond'ring Frier spy'd The Ladder on the Priory side, Which stood in a convenient place, Against the Wall in readiness, And having heard it whisper'd round The Broth'rhood, that John had found Much Grace and Favour in the sight Of the fair Lady of the Knight; From whence he thought his safest way Would be to o'er the Wall convey The Corps, and seat him at the Door Where he had often loll'd before, That Folks might think he lost his Life In waiting for his Worship's Wife, Because 't'ad whisper'd been already, That Frier John had kiss'd my Lady. No sooner had he thought of this But he resolv'd on't, hit or miss, And lugging him along the Ground, Toth' place where he the Ladder found, He did the twice kill'd Brother haul Aloft, and laid him cross the Wall, Thence drop'd him down, without regard What part came first into the Yard, Then striding, turn'd the Ladder o'er, As the Knight's Man had done before, That with more ease he might descend T'accomplish what he did intend; Accordingly he lug'd the Frier Unto the place of his desire, Leaving him seated on a Bench, Like Lover waiting for his Wench, Leaning his Head against a Stanchion Belonging to his Worship's Mansion, Returning to the Vault with speed, To do th'remainder of his Need, Poor Richard having spilt some Dregs Before upon his Thighs and Legs, And in his fright manur'd his Britches, With no small Sum of Gard'ners Riches. As now he sat o'er Boghouse-Hole, With aching Heart and troubl'd Soul, Reflecting soberly upon The heinous Evil he had done, Which seldom undiscover'd past Away, but came to Light at last, He could not think the Means he'd taken, Sufficient were to save his Bacon, 'Cause the whole Priory knew that he And Frier John could ne'er agree, Would therefore, without searching further, Conclude him guilty of the Murther: So that he thought the safest way Would be to fly by break of Day; But being corpulent and fatter Than usual, wisely thought it better To trust to four Legs, than alone Depend intirely on his own, And knowing that there was a Mare Beneath the Priory Baker's Care, A sturdy Beast both sound and strong, Which to the Convent did belong, Whose bus'ness early in the Morn Was to fetch Grist or carry Corn From Mill, or to the Mill, which stood Some distance from the Brotherhood. This Mare the Frier did depend Upon to stand his trusty Friend, Resolving, by the break of Day, To borrow'r and to ride away; So up he 'rose from off his Seat, Went in to make himself more sweet, And to prepare, before 'twas Light, All matters needful for his flight. The Knight who all this time had lain Reflecting on the Monk he'd slain, Was very restless and intent To know how the Adventure went, And whether any Monk as yet Had found poor John on Boghouse-Seat, He therefore bid his Servant go And listen up and down below, Beneath the Priory Wall, to find If the Monk's Death had taken Wind. Accordingly the Man, in fear, Crept down most softly Stair by Stair, And op'ning of the Door unheard, To gently steal into the Yard, At once he fix'd his Eyes upon The ghastly Corps of Frier John, Leaning his Head against a Post, Looking as frightful as a Ghost, His falling Jaws and glaring Eyes, Striking the Man with such surprise, That back he stagger'd, as if drunk, So sadly scar'd to see the Monk, That he'd no Power left to shut The Door and bar the Goblin out, But groap'd and fumbl'd back his way Toth' Chamber where his Master lay, Declaring, in a frightful Tone, That of a certain Frier John Was sitting in the Porch alone, And grin'd and star'd as if he meant To see them brought to Punishment. Nouns, quoth the Master, 'tis your fear, If dead, how should the Rogue come there? 'Tis nothing but your guilty Breast That makes you think so; 'tis a Jest. Come, thee and I'll go down together, We then shall soon discover, whether He's really in the Porch below, Or that thou only fancy'st so. With that the Valiant Knight, attended By Roger, to the Door descended, Where both beheld the Frier staring, Altho' as dead as any Herring. Now, quoth the Knight, I find thy Mouth Has told my Ears no more than truth, I see the Villain looks, tho' dead, As if he'd Mischief in his Head: His ghastly Grins, I own, are frightful; But since the Rogue's so very spightful, I'll find a way for this offence, To send him far enough from hence. I've an old Stallion in my Stable, Batter'd i'th' Wars and quite unable For Service, and a rusty Sute Of Armour, down from Head to Foot, All these will I bestow upon This restless Scoundrel Frier John, And bind him upright in the Saddle, That he shall neither fall nor waddle, With an old Target and a Lance, And the broad Sword I us'd in France, Then turn him out by break of Day, And let the Stallion chuse his way; He'll run like Forest Colt, I'm sure, As soon as out of Stable-Door, And the Monks dangling Legs, the while, Must spur him on, Mile after Mile. Thus shall they take their Chance together, And wander on we know not whither. No sooner had the Knight propos'd This Stratagem, but Roger clos'd, And gladly, to conceal the Murder, Put all the Furniture in order; So that the Monk was quickly drest, And well equip'd to mount his Beast, Who next was saddl'd like a Horse Appointed for the bloody Wars, And fed with Oats to make him stronger, That he might hold his speed the longer. By this time it was peep of Day, And time the Monk should make his way, Accordingly they ty'd him fast Into the Saddle by his Waste, And bound him with such Art, that he Sat almost upright, Cap-a-Pe; Then couching his tremendous Lance, They whip'd the Horse to make him Prance, And turn'd him loose without the Gate, Who flounc'd and gallop'd at no rate, And loudly farting as he ran, Took leave of Master and of Man. Monk Richard, who had taken care, E're this time to secure the Mare, Was fled a little space, before They'd turn'd his Brother out of Door; So that the Stallion having scent O'th' Mare, with all his fury went, Endeav'ring, by a swift pursuit, To overtake the Lady Brute, Threat'ning to give her, by his Neigh, A pleasing Horse-buss by the way; Tho' old and stiff, his brutal Lust Made him in Clouds throw up the Dust, And rend and run so like a Tyger, As if the Dev'l had been his Rider, Till in a little time the Horse Was got so near the Frier's Arse, That, turning, he was scar'd to see A Man in Armour Cap-a-Pe, With a Lance couch'd, come thund'ring a'ter, As if design'd for Blood and Slaughter, Therefore, with all the Heels he had, He kick'd and spur'd like any mad, Fancy'ng that in this armed order, Some Foe pursu'd him for the Murder; And now was almost past the hope Of 'scaping present Death or Rope: However, still he whip'd and tew'd Like any Highway-man pursu'd, Till scowring thro' a Town, at length, When's Mare had almost spent her strength, By chance he rid into a Lane, Where he was forc'd to turn again, And there the fiery Steed began To rise and mount both Mare and Man, And with a merc'less pawing Hoof, Soon knock'd the living Frier off, Who, as he fell, fix'd Eyes upon The frightful Face of Frier John; For lo the Beaver of the Helmet Was cock'd, and did not overwhelm it. The rustick Townsmen, who had seen 'em Ride thro' as if Old-Nick was in 'em, Flock'd tow'rds 'em now in frighted Throngs, Some arm'd with Clubs, and some with Prongs, Finding the Monk dismounted, lying On a green Bank, for Mercy crying, Whilst the dead Fri'r, from Head to Heel, Lock'd up in Coffin made of Steel, And his old Stallion, were attacking The Mare he wanted to be backing. The Rabble thought it now but just, To side with those that suffer'd most; Therefore resolv'd, with all their Force, T'assault the armed Man and Horse, Accordingly, with Staves and Clubs, They lent the Stallion many Drubs, Who, tho' in Wars he'd often run The risque of Foreign Sword and Gun, Had ne'er experienc'd, in his Life, The sad effects of civil Strife; So that, unable to oppose Or guard himself against their Blows, At length his Head receiv'd a thump That fairly set him on his Rump, Then steping up they seiz'd the Rein, And hung in swarms about his Mane, Subduing thus, by dint of Force, The Lifeless Rider and his Horse; But when the Combatant was found Dead as a Door-nail, on the Ground, The poor dishearten'd Clowns began To think their Blows had been his Bane, And that they now should, e'ery one, Be punish'd for the Ill they'd done, Till Frier Richard, sore opprest With Fear and Guilt, the Fact confess'd, Believing that this strange pursuit, And all things appertaining to't, Were done byth' providential Order Of Heaven to detect the Murder, That Penitence and shameful dying Might expiate a Sin so crying, And his own worthless Life attone For his Revenge on Frier John; So that upon the free Confession Of his unnatural Transgression, The murder'd Monk was strip'd and bury'd, And Frier Dick to Prison carry'd. The strange discov'ry, with each Fool, Now passing for a Miracle, Till the poor Frier at the 'Sizes, Was try'd by Twelve judicious Nisies, And by the same condemn'd to be A mournful sight at Gallow-Tree; And then the Knight, who was unwilling T'incur the Curse of double killing, Rode to His Majesty post hast, And told the truth of what had past, Obtaining a Reprieve that stop'd The guiltless Monk from being top'd, And in a short convenient time, A thorough Pardon for his Crime. In which old Story we may see What Shifts the Wicked make to free Their guilty selves from Jeopardy. Moral. The guiltless, by Mistake, sometimes Incur the blame of others Crimes, And guilty Persons oft prevent Their open Shame and Punishment. The Conforming Parson. A Satyr. When Judas, with ungrateful hands, had slain The Son of her who nurs'd him to a Man, Rob'd his own Father, took away his Life, And made his Mother his incestuous Wife, To Jesus then repentingly he fled, And him he also for Reward betray'd. Just so the A?????ry Convert, when he'd been Notorious long for every carnal Sin, He quits the Sect that did the Guide despise, And to the Church for Sanctuary flies; Where, wreaking from his Harlots, he attends Her sacred Rites, and daringly ascends The Pulpit, where he counterfeits the Priest, And underneath the Robe conceals the Beast; Comes to her Altars loaded with Disgrace, And still sins on with a conforming Face; Betrays the Holy Church to publick Shame, As Judas did the Builder of the same. Never let's boast such Proselytes as these, Only thrown out to purge the Sectaries. For them he left not, but was left i'th' lurch, That by conforming he might shame the Church, And by his Sinful Principles ensnare Some list'ning Flock beneath his ghostly Care. A late detection proves, alas, too plain, He only chang'd his Coat, but not the Man, Retaining still those Vices which, before His Recantation, stain'd the Cloth he wore. O Holy Mother keep thy Pulpits free And clean from such conforming Guides as he! Let no lascivious Cast-off, from among Pretended Saints, thy Reputation wrong, Or think thy Holy Discipline can make A good Divine of a Dissenting Rake. No! with new Failings he'll refresh his Stains, And scandalize the Robe with ill remains. So nauseous Dregs, which Brewers cast away, Distillers cleanse, and bring again in play; Yet, when by Art the Filth is most refin'd, The Stench will in the Spirit stay behind. A Dialogue between two Friends, Tom and Jack. Tom. How now, Friend Jack, what makes thee look so sowre? Jack. You know I'm marry'd, prithee ask no more. Tom. Marry'd! what then, that's but a trifling Curse. Jack. But I'm a Buck (a Cuckold) Tom, that's worse. Tom. That's a small Plague, there's thousands in the Town. Jack. Z???ds! but at three Months end I've got a Son. Tom. No matter, Wedlock makes it yours, you know. Jack. But is not she a Slut to serve me so? Tom. 'Tis but a common Failing in her Sex. Jack. But who that's Mortal can forbear to vex? Tom. Why would you wed, and such a hazard run? Jack. What signifies such Questions when it's done? Tom. You're bound to bear it, now she's made your Bride. Jack. Blood! Tom, I can't, for she's a Scold beside. Tom. Then hang thyself, I know no other Cure. Jack. I'll see her d???n'd first, an eternal W???re. Tom. Then hug thy Bargain, and be pleas'd thou'st got A bastard-bearing Scold, not worth a Groat. With Patience undergo thy wretched tease, And outdo that old Cuckold Socrates. A gentle Reproof to a deceitful Friend. Forbear, my Outside Friend, to shake my Hand Tell me no more, thou art at my Command. I scorn the Wretch that studies my Disgrace, Behind my Back, and Cringes to my Face. Thou'rt full of nauseous Flatt'ry and Deceit, And for true Friendship's sacred Bonds unfit: I hate the Fawnings of a double Tongue, That always speaks me fair, yet does me wrong: No more into my peaceful Bosom creep, To fish for Secrets which thou canst not keep, Nor villify thy Friends, to let me see, When my Back's turn'd, how thou canst rail at me, I've penetrating Eyes, and at one view, When e'er I see thy Face, can look thee through, And find Self-Int'rest lurking in thy Mind, With Craft, like unborn Twins, together join'd, Which Monsters govern thy Designs and thee, And fill thy Actions with Deformity, That what kind Offices thou dost thy Friend, Like a Whores Love, prove fatal in the end; And, at best, terminate in some ill Word, That blasts thy Favours, to thy gain, confer'd, And often purchas'd at a dearer Rate, Than Mercy at the Fleet or Compter Gate. Therefore pray boast no Friendships thou hast done, Since thy best Services are worse than none, And such, that e'ery prudent Man would fly, That knew thy Inside half so well as I. Creep not, from place to place, to pry and sift, Like an old Gossip, when thy only drift Can be, by tattling, to revive or make Mischief, for nothing but for Mischief's sake. Let mine, and other Men's Affairs, alone, And learn to manage, with more Wit, thy own. Thou'rt an old Man, 'tis true, I might have said Old Woman, by the rattle in thy Head, Therefore in pity to thy doating Age, I spare thy Follies, and restrain my Rage, And use thee, like an angry Judge that hides His Passion gravely, and with Temper chides; But if thou irritat'st my Muse, my Next Shall shew thee what a Poet is when vex'd; For Wrongs repeated, more and more provoke, And fresh Affronts deserve a smarter Stroke. The Good Man's Supplication. Bless me with Grace and Strength, to bear My Fortune and my Doom, That I my Course may boldly steer, To my Eternal Home. O grant me Goodness to forgive, And Patience to sustain The Wrongs and Inj'ries I receive From base and wicked Men! Let no Revenge inflame my Heart, No Anger tease my Mind, But let me act a Christian Part, Tow'rds God and all Mankind. Feed me, O Heav'n! with wholesome Food, And Cloath me from the Cold: Whilst Young, preserve me chast and good, And healthful when I'm Old. Let me be friendly to my Friend, To e'ery Mortal just, True to whatever I pretend, And faithful to my Trust. In safety Wise, in danger Brave; Be lib'ral but discreet, That when I'm mouldring in my Grave My Mem'ry may be sweet. FINIS. The Cuckoldy Yeoman: OR, The Adulteress's Visit to her dead Gallant. A wealthy Yeoman of Renown, Residing in a Country Town, Had chosen for his Wife a Woman Whose Lust had made her Tail too common; Among the rest of her Gallants, That satisfy'd her Female Wants, She had a strong-back'd Bully-Blade, Cut out for riding such a Jade, Who, by his Nonsence and his Noise, Jack-pudding Tricks and am'rous Toys, And other things we must not Name, So pleas'd the Cockles of the Dame, That him the Dowdy fancy'd best, And kiss'd much oftner than the rest. From whence it justly may be noted, That Wantons, to their Lust devoted, Chuse Fellows by their Backs, not Brains, To pleasure their Concupiscence. At length, by Revelling and Ranting, Horse-racing, Tipling, and Gallanting, Thackum, for by that Name alone The blust'ring Blade was chiefly known, Had brought himself so very low In Pocket, that the Country Beau Was forc'd to hang upon the Skirt Of her with whom he us'd to Sport, And live like that salacious Louse That plagues the Fair, and sticks so close, In lushious Parts criniferous. Nor had she any way to succour The craving Hand that us'd to stroke her, But by those Sleights which all such Hussies Will practise that Cornute their Spouses. The Key could not be left a Minute In the old Chest, but she was in it: No Money could his Pockets keep, Them she examin'd in his Sleep; And now and then a silver Spoon, Or Thimble, would be strangely gone; Which Rob'ry, to be sure, was laid Upon the guiltless Man or Maid; Or some poor Gammar who, at Door, Had beg'd Skim-milk but just before. By such collusive Arts as these She fed her Spark, till, by degrees, She'd made away with e'ery thing, That would the ready-Peny bring And that by Day or Night could be Remov'd without Discovery; Which shews what kind intriguing Dames Will do for those that feed their Flames, And how they'll knock things out of Joint, At home, to gain a ticklish Point. For Lust, alas, admits no Bridle, There's no Discretion in the middle, Where things will dance without a Fiddle. The Wanton much concern'd to find That she could be no longer kind To her dear Thackum, now was forc'd, In short, to let him know the worst, Telling him, tho' she lov'd him dearly, And would oblige him late or early, She'd not a Peny left to give him, Or any Present to relieve him, Besides those Favours which he knew He always should be welcome to. Marry, quoth Thackum, in a bluster, Without the Pence no Pater-noster. Adding, Large goings out, my dear, You know, large comings in require; Money buys Wine that makes as glad, Without, no Pleasure's to be had. For if you once withhold your Purse My am'rous Courage flags in course. After they had a while reflected On their past Pleasures, much dejected To think that Want should put an end To Love, and sep'rate Friend from Friend, Young Thackum and his dear departed, In mutual Grief, half broken hearted; The Dame lamenting for the loss Of what she'd often hug'd so close. The Spark, now left without Provision, As much concern'd at his Condition, Who was of all support bereft, And to the greatest hardships left. Thus pleasures gain'd by Usurpation, Have soon a sorrowful Cessation, And e'ery sweet bewitching Vice, Leaves Stings proportion'd to their Joys. Thackum, who'd been of late so jolly, Now felt the smart of all his Folly, And bit so hard upon the Bridle, That he could live no longer idle; Therefore resolv'd, whate'er came on't, By Robb'ry to relieve his Want. Accordingly he rode abroad, To try his Fortune on the Road, Flushing himself in divers places, With very notable Successes. That now his Pockets b'ing replenish'd, And his late fear of Starving vanish'd, He soon renew'd his am'rous League, And carry'd on his old intrigue, Wanting no Money to support Th'Expence of meeting with his Flirt, That now they revell'd up and down In this and 'tother Country-Town, As oft as the Adult'rous Blowze Could feign a Lye to cheat her Spouse: But as such sweet delights at last, Are always bitter to the tast, Thackum, who'd gone a step too far, And kill'd a noted Traveller, As well as rob'd him, was pursu'd By Clowns, and taken in a Wood, Carr'd, Coram nobis, and committed To Prison, where he lay unpity'd; Till try'd, the next Assize, before Judge Graybeard, and a dozen more, And when convicted by his Betters, Was sentenc'd to be hang'd in Fetters, Which, on the next Fish-day, in presence of Hundreds, was perform'd with decence, Whilst many Gammars in the Crowd Held up their Hands and cry'd aloud 'Twas pity such a clever smug Well-looking Fellow, tho' a Rogue, Should be tuck'd up, so like a Dog; But all the sorrow that they shew'd, Did dying Thackum little good, For there, as soon as he had sung His penetential Psalm, he swung, And hung to scare the Crows away From the Corn-Fields that round him lay, And to deter the Country Gaffers From ploughing with their Neighbours Heifers. Thus wanton Women, we may see, Bring foolish Men to Poverty, And Poverty, for want of Grace, Still prompts them to be further base. When Thackum thus had made his End, And left his old Adult'rous Friend To mourn the loss of her Gallant, Who us'd to ease her greatest Want, The Dame, who did not dare to pay A Visit, all the time he lay Fetter'd i'th' County Jayl, because The Jaylor knew whose Wife she was, Grew much concern'd that she had been So slighting to the best of Men. For Wantons measure humane goodness, Not by Mens Vertues but their Lewdness: Therefore, since she had prov'd ungrateful To him who'd always been so faithful, She now resolv'd, one Night or other, To steal out to her pendant Lover, Hoping a Visit to her dead Gallant, affectionately paid, Might so attone for her remisness, As to remove her great uneas'ness; Accordingly, one Ev'ning dark, She Journey'd tow'rds her hanging Spark, Who'd taken up his lofty Station, A Mile without the Corporation, Fearing, should she attempt the same By Day, 'twould scandalize her Name; Therefore she staid till friendly Night Had just o'ercome the fading Light, And then, like any Buxom Lass In hopes of stealing an Embrace, She jog'd along with all her pow'r, As if each Minute seem'd an Hour. As she was thus approaching near Her elevated dangling Dear, A drunken Tinker, who, by chance, In nappy Ale had drown'd his Brains, Beneath a Hedge was laid along, Close by the Gib where Thackum hung, That a cool Sleep upon his Fuddle, Might soberize his dizzy Noddle; And having, for some time, been taking A hearty Nap, was just awaking As Madam made a stop, to stare At her dear Lover in the Air; She seeming very much dismay'd To see him hanging o'er her Head, Began with Tears, and, for a while, Cry'd like a Crocodile of Nile; At length her sobbing Silence broke, And thus to the Cadaver spoke: O wretched Eyes! O dismal Night, That shews me this unhappy Sight! O faithless Woman I! to fail Of comforting thy heart in Jayl, When thou, to me, wouldst often spare Much more than was one Woman's share, And must I now, my only Dear, Go back and leave thee swinging here.? “No, quoth the Tinker, let's not part, “I'll with thee gang, with all my Heart. Th'Adultress hearing this reply, And seeing none but Thackum nigh, Thought 'twas an Answer from her Lover, And run as if the Devil drove her, Believing he was coming down To hand her back into the Town; The Tinker rising, hobbl'd after As fast as e'er he could for Laughter, And teasing Corns, that made him tread Too cautious for a Man of speed, Crying, Good Honey slack your pace, You scowre as if you run a Race, I am too stiff for such a course. Nouns, you are swifter than a Horse. But nothing would abate her Vigour, For still she gallop'd like a Tyger, Conceiting, all the way she fled, 'Twas Thackum, tho' she saw him dead, The rather, 'cause she heard a clinking O'th' Tinker's Tools, which, to her thinking, Were the loose Irons, Chains and Fetters, About the dearest of her Creatures; Therefore she did the faster trudg it, At e'ery rattling of the Budget: Nor could she, by her looking back, Discover more than something black, Which undistinguishable sight, At e'ery gaze, encreas'd her Fright, And made her trespass upon Nature, The more, to make their distance greater, Till she, at length, recover'd home, Where the poor Cuckold, in a Room, In solitude had perch'd his Crupper, On a tall Buffet Stool, at Supper, But in run frighted Blowzabel, Expecting Thackum at her Tail, And tumbl'd down the greasy Eggs And Bacon, 'twixt her Husband's Leggs, Dreading sad usage, shame, or slaughter, From him she fear'd was coming a'ter; Therefore, to make herself securer, Blunder'd o'er all that stood before her, Crying, Dear Husband fight and save me, Or Thackum, tho' he's hang'd, will have me. Which so amaz'd her 'Spouse, that he Was frighted full as bad as she. But her Friend Thackum never came, As was expected by the Dame; For when the Tinker saw her Hous'd, He went to th'Alehouse and carous'd, There made the merry Story known, From whence 'twas bruited up and down, Till the Adult'rous Jilt became A common Town-talk, to her shame. Moral. Tho' many act an odious part, In hopes to hide their sins by Art, Yet humane Craft no Guilt can smother, 'Twill come to light some way or other. The End.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Numb. II. The Character of a certain rattling Whig. Of all the Fools the present Times produce, A Whig disgusted is the most profuse; Not of his Wealth, but lavish of his Tongue; Hot in Debate, tho' always in the wrong; Yet wheresoe'er the Saint vouchsafes to come, He roars, if thwarted, like a beaten Drum; Does all he says most solemnly aver For truth, and will no contradiction bear, But stiles, whoe'er opposes him, at least A Jacobite, if not a Popish Priest; Does e'ery Hour new factious Shams devise, And rails at all that disbelieve his Lyes, Tho' he himself's too stubborn and morose To credit Truth that does his Int'rest cross, And will no Faith embrace, or Doctrine chuse, But what well suits his Purpose, like his News. So Governments revive those Laws that best Will serve their present turn and slight the rest. Eugene, altho' he blunders, must be thought The most Heroick Prince that ever fought; And Villars, tho' he baffles him, be made The meerest Pigmy Gallia ever bred. Whate'er the Dutch propose shall be allow'd To tend to Europe's universal good. What Britain does, beneath the Royal Care, So wisely manage, must be thought unfair. War, to a glorious Peace, be still prefer'd, That Poverty may flourish by the Sword. And thus he raves and rattles up and down, Madly blaspheming both the Church and Crown, Bullies all those that he can over-reach, But by his Tongue sometimes betrays his Breech To undergo that Penance, justly due To him that's Saucy to he knows not who. Good News from foreign Parts, at which he's vex'd He mangles as a Tubster does his Text; And, o'er his Ninny-Broth, to shew his spight, Will construe it all ways, except the right; But when the naked Truth prevails and shines, Thro' all the misty Falsities he coins, Sowre as a Bull-dog at a Butcher's Heels, He lobs and leers and with ill-nature swells, And looks as if he ready was to bite Each Man he meets for a Sachev'relite, Who, in his Frowns may easily discover What bloody News th'last Dutch Mail brought over So the frow'rd Gamester damns the Dice, when broke, And makes himself the Picture of Ill-luck, That whosoe'er observes the Rake's Grimace, May read his late Ill-fortune in his Face. In Tavern, factious Healths are his delight, In which, at once, he shews his Love and Spight. Against the Throne his Calumnies he spreads, And rattles forth Eugene and Marlbrough's Deeds, Lessens the Conduct which he ought to praise, And impudently warrants all he says; If contradicted, like a Hector huffs, And heeds no Arguments but Kicks and Cuffs; Abandons Duty, Modesty, and Sence, And rattles with unbounded Insolence; Gives us, instead of Reason, what the Great And Rev'rend Fl?d terms, we know not what; To Men of Manners makes himself appear A more absurd Companion than a Bear; Among the factious Clan has knacks to please, But is to all the World besides a tease; The Church he laughs at, and can scarce afford The least due rev'rence to the sacred Word; Tries all Religion by the touchstone Rules Of Daniel's Revolution Principles; Rejecting that as naught which don't agree With pulling down the Pow'r of Monarchy; And ridicules all Doctrine, 'less its brought From Holland, and in Moorfield's Allies taught; Yet claims the Name of Protestant, in hope To save himself by damning of the Pope; For all his Practises too plainly shew, He's less a Christian than a Turk or Jew; Honours the empty Name, but thinks the rest A Cheat, a humane Artifice, a Jest, Long since invented, and by Laws enjoin'd By crafty Tyrants to enslave Mankind; Yet of Religion talks, as many do Of Robin Hood, whose Bow they never drew; But 'tis not in his Nature to afford The Rev'rend Clergy one respectful Word, Except those few who for the Faction preach, And scandalize the Truths they ought to teach. Thus bad, and worse, is he whose Tongue of late, At Will's, did such provoking Nonsense prate, Condemn'd the Ministry, extol'd the Dutch, Stain'd his own Country with unjust reproach, Till, for his Pains, he was compell'd to take A High-Church footing for the Low-Church sake. Whig and Tory. An Epigram. A vaunting Whig cry'd, Holland and Eugene Will do the Work without the Church and Queen. An honest Tory standing by, reply'd, Faith, Friend, your Confidence declares your Side But wiser Heads believe, that France will gain The Empire sooner than the Empire Spain. The Courtier's Compliment. An Epigram. Old blunt Sir Edward went to see the Queen, Sal held the Door and would not let him in. Madam, quoth he, you look so like your Mother, That were she here, whose Deeds no Grave can smother, Tho' puff'd so big of late, by him that made ye, We scarce shou'd know the Dutchess from the Lady The B?????s. An Epigram. In the Lord's House for Peace the B????s pray, But Vote i'th' House of Lords another way. So Phillis in Jove's Temple sits demure, But, in the Temple of the Law turns Whore. The Climber. A Fable. A swain, who had from time to time Stood fair in Fortune's Books, Made it his chief delight to climb Aloft to rob the Rooks. But growing foolish in his Age, When too securely blest, To please the Knaves, would needs engage To take an Eagle's Nest. He did accordingly ascend A dang'rous Rock that grew By the Sea-side, to gain the End His Comrades had in view. But as he did too close invade The Eagle's lofty Throne, The Royal Bird her Pinions spread, And beat the Dotard down, Who spralling lay much marr'd and maim'd, Repenting what he'd done, And, for his Pains, was mock'd and blam'd By those that set him on. Moral. Whoe'er at Government presumes To climb, and gets a Fall, Loses his Honour, and becomes The ridicule of all. The Two Harlots. An Epigram. Engaging Phillis to her Arms decoy'd A Spark of Chloe's, she had long enjoy'd, Hussy, quoth Chloe, you're a treach'rous Jade, I'd give you half my Cloaths, or half my Bread, But not an Inch of my Gallant, you W??re. And then the Rival's Coif the Fury tore. Spare me, quoth Phil. forgive the Wrong I've done, Two is too many for so dull a Drone, I must confess he's not enough for one. Chloe at Church. A Song. As in Jove's Temple once I pray'd, A lovely Angel did surprize My Soul, and, as she sat, display'd A thousand Blessings with her Eyes. Her Looks outshone the God of Day, Her Face and Mein did well agree; Devout she seem'd, tho' young and gay, And awful as a Deity. As she adorn'd the Holy Place, Her Charms diffus'd a beauteous Light, But when her Fan eclips'd her Face, The pleasing Day was turn'd to Night. At e'ery distant view I took, A sudden Ague froze each Vein, But when she blest me with a Look, A Fever thaw'd my Blood again. So great was her resistless Pow'r, And so obsequious was my Love, I scarce knew which to most adore, Her Beauty or the Gods above. O bounteous Venus! make her kind, In her both Joy and Torment dwell; For in her Smiles a Heav'n I find, But in her scornful Frowns a Hell. The Countryman's description of his Mistress. She had, Gaffer Dumbleton, ay marry had she, On each of her Brows a handful of Hair, And rowl'd about two goggle Eyes like a mad she, Was as rude as a Colt, and as rough as a Bear. Her Udders no Cow newly calv'd could have bigger, Her Belly so large, tho' I speak for no harm, That whoever, I'm sure, has the Fortune to dig her, Had need have a Spade full as long as my Arm. Her Buttocks, no Mare can have plumper or fatter, Like Stones in a Mill they most lovingly grind; And if they're ne'er work'd by the strength of her Water, I'm sure they are often supply'd by the Wind. Of Cleanliness, Nouns, she's a notable Pattern, Her sweaty black Locks she oft combs on her Cheese, Upon which, with her Thumb, the sweet hussisly Slattern Cracks heaps upon heaps, as it lies on her Knees. Her Cloaths she becomes as a Sow does a Saddle, Her Bonnet-flaps flies from her Pockfretten Face; And whenever she walks e'ery Step is a Straddle, As if the great Maukin was striding a Race. No Hog in a Stye has a Hogo more frowsy, Her Skin looks as yellow as rusty fat Bacon: And can she believe I would wed such a Hussy? No, no, if she does she is wound'ly mistaken. The Tinker's Courtship. Come Jug, tho' thou'rt tawny, I'll make thee my Honey, Thou'rt youthful and charming, Altho' thou'rt so brown; Thy Features and Favours, Thy Smiles and Behaviours, To me are more warming, Than Paint, Powder, Patches, Fine Dresses, Gold-Watches, Now worn by each Jilt of the Town. I'll love thee and hug thee, Lie close in cold Weather. Then prithee now, Juggy, Let's travel together. Our am'rous Souls we'll feast Upon a Bed of Straw, True Lovers want no Priest, The honest need no Law. Then be loving and kind, without further debate, For to cozen the Church is the fashion of late. The deceitful Lady punish'd, AND Innocent Love rewarded. A rich old Batchelor, whose care Was chiefly to provide an Heir Of his own getting, or, at least, A Wife, by whom he might be bless'd With a fair Offspring, to his honour, Tho' by his Friends begot upon her, Happen'd to find a Coltish Tooth In's Head, that had surviv'd his Youth, Which so bewitch'd him with a strong Desire, to such a charming young And Buxom Lass, so full of Lust, That if he cou'd not, others must; Not that she'd lost her Reputation, Whate'er might be her Inclination, But was too fair and gay, by much, For Age, Gout, Flannel, and a Crutch, That any might foresee his Fortune Would soon be seal'd behind the Curtain, Or that he would be thought, at best, A Cuckold, tho' his Wife was chast. For he that's old and has the folly To wed a Maid that's young and jolly, Tho' none have dabbl'd with his 'Spouse, Yet common Fame will horn his Brows, For all Men think that fumbl'd Beauty Hath reason to transgress her Duty. However, Gravity and Phtysick, In hopes young Flesh would prove good Physick, Ventur'd upon the beauteous Maid, And took her to his Marriage Bed; His Fortune being much the greater, Hers chiefly in the Gifts of Nature, For which good Reason she comply'd To be the old Curmudgeon's Bride, That when kind Death had snatch'd away, From her warm Sides, his frozen Clay, And he had left her Gay and Wealthy, She might have one more Young and Healthy. These hopes alone make Youth engage In Marriage with decrepit Age, As Boys serve 'prentiships to be More happy Masters when they're free. The wealthy Dotard having thus Got a fair Bride to Hug and Buss, Thought himself highly bless'd, above All other Mortals, in her Love, And fumbl'd on with all his Spirit, To raise an Heir, that might inherit His large Possessions, but his Madam Found matters not as she'd have had 'em; So that things would not happen right, As both sides highly wish'd they might, Tho' still he doted so upon The charming Prize his Age had won, That all the Year was Honey-Moon. But in this Interim a kind Old trusty Neighbour and a Friend, Who was as great as Cup and Kan With the new-marry'd Gentleman, Had a brisk Youth who just was come From tedious Foreign Travel home, And for the sake of his good Father, Or his own worthy Merits rather, Was by the Husband much respected, And by the Wife as well affected, So that at length he grew as free, In the miscoupl'd Family, As if the Youth had been no other Than th'old Man's Son or Madam's Brother, Being by both most kindly treated, As far as Modesty permitted, But no Intrigue carr'd on that cou'd Be justly reckon'd base or lewd, Tho' e'ery Freedom else, in truth, Were taken by the Wife and Youth; Who, tho' they had no sinful Meetings, Would play together like two Kittens, And sometimes in her Chamber chat, But without off'ring you know what; For you must think she often bedded Apart from the Old Man she'd wedded, That she might rest without the teasings Of Flegmy Coughs, and Phtisick-Wheesings, Then 'twas they'd dally for an Hour Or two, and toy, but do no more, Till drowsy Nature sleep requir'd, And then the civil Youth retir'd. So when Platonick Lovers walk In Groves, they Ogle, Jest, and Talk, But scorn to stain their Conversation, With the sweet Sin of Procreation. Thus Friendship got the start of Lust, And tho' they lov'd, yet both were Just, Improving, to their great Content, Such Freedoms as were Innocent: At length, when both in private were The Youngster, toying with the Fair, Made bold to ask her, If her 'Spouse Should take his farewel, who she'd chuse To be her next, in case she shou'd Think fit to change her Widowhood, To which she, like a loving Wife, Reply'd, Pray God preserve the Life Of my good Husband, tho' he's old; But if he should to Heav'n be call'd, Yourself my only choice should be, Provided you'd accept of me. Which answer so oblig'd the Youth, That he at once confess'd the truth, And vow'd, that, as he lov'd her dearly, He'd be at her Command intirely, Would also gladly wait the time With patience, would she vow to him, That, when it happen'd, he alone Should be the Man she'd pitch upon. With which she readily comply'd, And swore herself his future Bride, In case that he should live to see Her Husband's Exit set her free. Thus was the Bargain bound most firmly, And seal'd with Kisses very warmly. By this time, tho' they'd never made A vicious use o'th' Marriage-Bed, Yet had their freedoms giv'n a handle To some ill Neighbours, that a Scandal Was rais'd, and whisper'd far and near, Till it had reach'd his Father's Ear, Who, being troubl'd that his Son Should into such an Error run, Tax'd him with the Offence severely, Tho' he deny'd it as sincerely, And, to his Fathers Satisfaction, Abjur'd the Guilt of such an Action. But the old Gentleman b'ing much Concern'd that such a vile Reproach Should, on his Sons account, be cast On his Friend's Wife, believ'd so chast, And thinking so much smoak could ne'er Ascend without some hidden Fire, Enjoin'd the Youngster to desist His Visits, till the rising Mist Was blown away, which had already Clouded the Vertue of the Lady. The Youth, altho' this Obligation Sat as uneasy as Castration, Yet fearing, if he disobey'd, He should be disinherited, His distance kept, and did not dare To visit his beloved Fair, Or, as he us'd to do, carouse A Bottle with her ancient 'Spouse, Who now began to wonder, why The Youth withheld his Company, Who had not won, by his Behaviour, Only the Wife's, but Husband's Favour; So far, that he design'd to make him His Heir when God should please to take him; Therefore for fear some disrespect Among his Servants, or neglect Had giv'n Offence, he sent a Letter T'enquire into the truth o'th' matter And beg'd to know the reason why He'd been, of late, so very shy, The Youth not willing to disclose The Cause that held him from the House, Pretended that his long remisness Was owing to some urgent Bus'ness; And therefore humbly hop'd his Goodness, At present, would excuse his Rudeness, And that e'relong he'd come and own His Fault, and for the same attone. This Answer he return'd by th'Hand That brought the Letter from his Friend, But did not dare to write a Word To th'Lady he so much ador'd, For fear the consequence should prove Destructive to their mutual Love, And happen to confirm the bad Report, which Evil-Tongues had spread; Therefore, the danger to prevent, His humble Service only sent. Just after this, as walking through A Fair, the Youngster went to view, He chanc'd to meet with Mistress Kather'n, The Confident and Chamber Slattern, That waited on the Lady bright, The object of his sole delight, And glad of such a good occasion To gratify his am'rous Passion, In hearing of her Health at least, And how his absence had displeas'd, He scrap'd Acquaintance with the Lass, And took her in to take a Glass, O'er which he lib'rally set forth Her Lady's Vertues, Wit, and Worth; How far he chastly did adore her, And what an Honour he had for her, At which the Hoyden laugh'd, and cry'd, Alas, Sir, you are quite beside The Cushion, you're a stranger to her, You'd scarce so praise her if you knew her; She only gives the Shell to you, Whilst others do the Kernel chew. “Prithee Sweet-heart, reply'd the Squire, “Explain your meaning, I desire, “I cannot think her such a sly “Deceptress as your words imply. You may believe her, quoth the Creature, A perfect Saint, but I know better, For if I'm sitting in this place, And you are now before my Face, Your own Companion, Young Philaster, Has kiss'd her oft'ner than my Master, That is, together they've been naught; I mean, by kissing,—you know what. “'Tis sure impossible, reply'd The Gentleman, “She could not hide “So black a Guilt with so much Grace “And charming Goodness in her Face, “I'm satisfy'd it cannot be, “Her Looks confirm her Modesty; “Besides, I never heard my Friend “Drop one kind saying, that could tend “Tow'rds any such Intrigue between 'em, “So oft as I've together seen 'em, “Nor all the times that we have sat “With Madam, talking this or that, “Could I, from either Countenance “Discern one sly suspicious Glance. No, no, says Kather'n, they have too Much cunning to be catch'd by you, Yet they as surely do embrace As this is Cyder in the Glass; For I am forc'd sometimes to be Privy to what I hate to see. Quoth the young Squire, ‘The Crime's too filthy, “And she too Vertuous to be guilty, “I cannot, will not, think her yet “So full of Lewdness and Deceit. Think as you please, cries taudry Kate, But I'm your Friend, I tell you that, It must come out, e'relong, most surely, They can't Sin always so securely, And then you'll see how wond'rous chast Your Angel will appear at last; But pray forbear to tell my Lady What in true Friendship I have said t'ye. After he'd promis'd to conceal What Kate thought proper to reveal, He drank a Glass, half broken hearted, And from the Tell-tale Gossip parted, Reflecting upon what the Slut Into his thoughtful Head had put; Sometimes believing that the Lass Herself, might covet his Embrace, And therefore fram'd these Lies to make The Beauty he ador'd look black: Or that her Malice, upon some Disgust, had spur'd her to become So base a Jade, as to detract Her Lady, guiltless of the Fact: These Thoughts, supported by the Pow'r Of that tenacious Love he bore, So far o'ercame those Doubts and Fears, Which enter'd at his glowing Ears, That he, at length, was fully bent To judge the Lady innocent, Resolving all that had been said, Was only Malice in the Maid. So fond Uxorious Cuckolds wedded To Harlots, by their Neighbours bedded, If told, in friendship, of their Wives Backslidings, and salacious Lives, They disbelieve the Fact, and rail At him or her that bears the Tale. Soon after this a second Letter Was sent by the old Fornicator, To the young 'Squire, wherein he made Much wonder that he had not paid One Visit yet, and beg'd to know The reason, why he us'd him so, Entreating, also, that he'd come And make his Mansion-House his Home. The loving Youth, who much desir'd To see the Lady he admir'd, After his Ears had heard a Story So odious and defamatory, Did to her 'Spouse an Answer write, That he'd be with him such a Night But beg'd him that he would be ready, Without the knowledge of his Lady, In such a Room, at such an Hour, And open leave his Garden-door, Thro' which he would in private pass, And with him take an Ev'ning's Glass, Giving him caution not to scatter A Word i'th' House about the matter, Except to him he did design Should wait upon 'em with their Wine, And that he'd give him Reasons, why He did desire such privacy. When the time came, the Youngster paid His secret Visit unbetray'd, And by his good old trusty Friend, Was very kindly entertain'd, To whom he frankly did disclose The Cause that kept him from his House; And that he hop'd his being there Would never reach his Father's Ear. For if it should, he well foreknew, Much Anger would at least ensue; And that the consequence might prove A less'ning of his Father's Love. The good Old Man did much commend The Care he took to not offend, And thank'd him for his great Discretion, In stifling that Disreputation, Which Evil-Tongues had rais'd without Sufficient cause, he did not doubt; Therefore excus'd his long forbearance, Approving of his non-appearance. In drinking, and in such-like Chat, They spent the happy Night, till late, That Age, not able to endure A further Glass at such an Hour, Was forc'd to drowsily retire To Bed, and leave his Friend the 'Squire, To nod a little time away Upon a Couch, till Break-of-Day, Wh'intended early to be gone, Before the rising of the Sun, That not a Servant, but the Waiter, Might know a tittle of the Matter: But when he found himself alone, His Thoughts were so intent upon The object of his Hopes and Joys, That Morphens could not close his Eyes, For Love still hover'd o'er his Heart, And kept him waking with his Dart. At length consid'ring that the way Toth' Chamber where the Lady lay, Was up a Stair-case that he knew, He ventur'd to approach thereto, Hoping, according to her use, She might be sep'rate from her Spouse, And that the Door might only be Upon the Latch, or that the Key Was left by Carelesness without, Or some such Accident fall out, Whereby he might relieve his Passion, By a few Moments Conversation. For Love, in Solitude, creates A thousand Whimsies in our Pates; And, when our Brains with Wine are dizzy, Renders all Hazards safe and easy. This the desirous loving Youth Found, by experience, to be truth; And starting from his easy Couch, On tip-toe made his soft approach, Till to the Chamber of the Dame, At length, by cautious Steps, he came, But found the Door he gently grop'd for, Too fast for th'entrance that he hop'd for: However, list'ning stood to hear The Breathings of his charming Dear, Which he discover'd much more loud, Than he expected that he shou'd, As if some lushious Dream had rais'd her Into an extasy that pleas'd her. At length the squeaking Bed comply'd With Motions wich he heard beside, And Whispers, Sighs, and kissing Smacks, In Chorus join'd with Bedstead cracks; By which he plainly understood, His Angel was about no good: At last discover'd very plain, Some kind Expressions of a Man, By whose sweet Words and Voice he knew Philaster to be one o'th' two; Which now convinc'd him, that the Mouth Of Kate had spoke no more than truth, And that his Angel was, at best, A Devil downwards from the Wast, Altho' when lac'd within her Bodice, She upwards look'd so like a Goddess. These sinful Workings so amaz'd The 'Squire, that he was almost craz'd, To think how he'd been bubbl'd by A Jilt, so wicked and so sly, Thinking at first to force his way, And stick the Lovers as they lay: But then reflecting that so heinous A Crime was very dissentaneous To Reason, Justice, and to all The Laws Divine and Natural; And that all Ages held it good, That Blood should be repay'd with Blood. He overcame those daring Thoughts, And left 'em to repeat their Fau'ts, Stealing down Stairs, to shun all further Incentives to so black a Murder, Quitting the Mansion in a deep Concern, when Day began to peep, Returning timely home, without His Father's knowing he'd been out. But when he came to recollect His Love, and Madam's foul defect, Her Wickedness and his own Folly, Possess'd his Heart with melancholy, Which ended in a Fit of Sickness, Attended with consumptive Weakness: However he, by Art, at length, Grew better, and recover'd strength, Resolving now to spend his Days In travelling from Place to Place, Hating his Native Country, where Such Monsters liv'd among the Fair; But from his Friends conceal'd, with Caution, The Reasons of his Resolution, Pretending only 'twas his Fancy He should regain his Health beyond-Sea, Which here the sharpness of the Air, He found, did very much impair, When Madam's Levity alone Provok'd the Youngster to be gone. For who that Loves, and is deny'd, Can bear to have the Nymph enjoy'd, And he himself unpity'd stay Till Death has snatch'd her 'Spouse away; And then, to cool his am'rous Heat, Must take the Bitter with the Sweet. Therefore the 'Squire, to cure his Passion, Prepar'd for Foreign Per'grination, Resolving, when he just was ready To march, once more to see the Lady, And give the Jilt to understand, By Letter thrust into her Hand, What he'd detected, how and when; And that it might appear more plain, Recited sev'ral Words that pass'd, During the time she was embrac'd, Such as no Woman could forget, They were so joyful and so sweet: And what's most feelingly express'd, The tender Sex remember best. When thus he'd penn'd a stabbing Letter, For his dear, fair, deceitful Creature, To his Friend's House away he went, To put in practise his intent; Also to dine and to carouse A parting Bottle with her 'Spouse: Which he accordingly perform'd, Till with the Wine their Brains were warm'd. The good old Man, at e'ery turn, Expressing very much concern, That he should lose, for evermore, A Friend he'd so much kindness for, Making large Offers, if he'd change His Temper, and forbear to range: But all his Kindness would not make The 'Squire his Resolution break; Who, when 'twas almost time to think Of parting, did from Table slink, That he might opportunely find A Minute to express his Mind To Madam, who as much desir'd To grant the Favour he requir'd, That she might shed a farewel Tear, To comfort her departing Dear, And steal a Kiss from him she reckon'd She had secur'd to be her Second: But he no sooner found the Lady, In place convenient, standing ready, Weeping in melancholy Posture, But thus did in a Rage accost her. O false dissembling Fair, the worst Of Women, bless'd, and yet accurs'd; Happy in thy external Feature, But wretched in thy lustful Nature; Angelick in thy Looks and Mien, But black and devil-like within. “Lord, Sir, reply'd the Lady frighted, “Why am I thus misus'd and slighted? “What have I done? What just occasion “Given for this unruly Passion? There, thou perfidious wicked Creature, Replies the Lover, read that Letter; Let that thy odious Failings tell, Which wrack my Bosom. So farewel. Then, turning short, return'd again To the old nodding Gentleman, And bidding his dear Friend adieu, With all convenient haste withdrew, Leaving the Lady to unfold Those startling Truths the Letter told, And to reflect upon her Folly, O'ercome with Grief and Melancholy, That quite unable to sustain Her Guilt, which he had prov'd so plain, Too conscious of the Ills she'd acted, In a few Days she dy'd distracted. Whose Death so wrought upon her 'Spouse, Who knew not she had horn'd his Brows, That he himself departed soon, And wanting Issue of his own, Did, in his dying Will declare The fortunate young 'Squire his Heir, Who being by cross Winds with-held, Receiv'd the News before he sail'd, And soon returning from aboard, Enjoy'd the truth of what he'd heard. Moral. Thus modest Looks too often skreen The Serpent Lust that lurks within. But Time turns sinful Joys to Sadness. And good Mens Sorrows into Gladness. The End.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Numb. III. The English Foreigners: OR, The Whigs turn'd Dutchmen. A Satyr. Wonder no more, that a voracious Breed Of monstous Brutes, should on the weaker feed Blame not the hungry Wolf, who sucks the Blood Of harmless Sheep, and helpless Lambs, for Food: Nor think it strange that mighty Whales should prey Upon the finny Race, less strong than they: Or that the soaring Eagle should devour Those Birds unable to resist her Pow'r, Since the vile Wretch, so proud of being Man, Who glories in the style of Christian, Does, in the Name of God, his Malice vent, And preys upon the Weak and Innocent; Breaks thro' all Fences moral and divine, To grasp that bane of humane Comfort, Coin; Rebells against the Throne he should obey, Does Publick Good, for Private Ends, betray; Treads on the Necks of others, that his Pride May be with boundless Pow'r and Wealth supply'd; Adapts his Faith to his nefarious Heart, Turns all Religion into Craft and Art, And tow'rds his Native Country acts a Traytor's Part. Long has the Serpent lurk'd within the Saint, Who uses Grace as Harlots do their Paint, Wears it, as ornamental, in his Face, When all his Inside is corrupt and base; That those who gaze, with injudicious Eyes, Upon the sacred Villain in disguise, May take the Knave, in Musquerade, to be A Saint, by his external Sanctity; When all his Aim is to deceive the Crowd, And make his impious Actions pass for good. So cunning Bawds much Piety profess, And cloak their Vices with a rev'rend Dress, That they among the vertuous may intrude, And, for their Int'rest, tempt 'em to be lewd. Where are those ancient Holy Precepts fled, By which the Christian must be happy made? Those sacred Truths by God to Man reveal'd, And with his precious Blood, that taught 'em, seal'd? They guide us to obey the great Supream, Who sways the Regal Scepter under Him, And recommend Love, Unity, and Peace, As the true Grounds of humane Happiness. How then can they who thwart the Sov'reign Pow'r To propagate a Sanguinary War, (After such vast immensity of Blood And Treasure have been lavishly bestow'd To gain a happy Peace) deserve the name Of Christian, who declare against the same; And when the jarring Crowns the Breach would heal, Thirst for more Blood, and cry, Fight on and Kill? For say our English-Dutchmen, 'tis a Crime To treat of Peace till Holland thinks 'tis time. Holland, who, when unable to defend Herself, had Britain for her trusty Friend, And to Eliza. ow'd that happy state Which bounteous Anna has preserv'd of late; And at a vast expence of English Blood, As well as Treasure, generously stood 'Twixt them and Danger, we too plainly see, To th'hazard of her own Security; And longer than was needful to obtain A glorious lasting Peace with France and Spain; To please a Race who only want the Pow'r To govern basely, plunder and devour, And, by their own destructive Laws, command The Pockets of a poor misguided Land, Till to themselves they do the whole secure, Beneath the Umbrage of a needless War. As Thieves pick open Quarrels, and defy Each other, to beguile the Standers-by. O fair Britannia! whither art thou run? What Changes hast thou made? What Evils done? That thy own Sons should thy Destruction seek, And take a pride in making Thee more weak. What Monsters hast thou suckl'd at thy Breast? What upstart Traytors cherish'd and caress'd? Who, when the God of War would sheath his Sword, That banish'd Peace might timely be restor'd, Oppose the Blessing, which they ought to court, And pelt the Goddess with their sland'rous Dirt, Attack thy Throne with saucy Foreign Scrolls, By a Dutch Faction, styl'd Memorials. Concerted first by a Domestick Race Of Whigs and Atheists, treacherously base, Then wafted over to that pious Land Where Money does their Hearts and Hands command, And where our factious Statesmen fain would pawn Our English Welfare, to secure their own. Thence were the Libels, when the Dunks had sign'd The same, remitted with the next fair Wind, That our disgusted Saints might shew their spleen, And teaze our only Happiness, the Queen. Nor had they sooner to her Hand convey'd The base Reflections they had falsly made, Than all their Party-Scriblers were imploy'd, And envious Tongues, to bruit the same abroad, With such Encomiums on our Dutch Allies, As trusty Friends, so over just and wise, That Britain ought intirely to rely On Holland, for her own Prosperity; And should from them (not they from us) derive Such Terms of Peace as they (not we) might thrive. Which shews what Love our whiggish Faction bear To their own native Land, when they prefer A Foreign Int'rest to their Country's Good: And, rather than preserve her Wealth and Blood, Would lavish both, that their unbounded Pride, And gnawing Malice, might be satisfy'd, In pulling down their Rulers, that the Knaves Might all be Kings, and honest Men their Slaves. Then Blockheads should Most Reverend commence, Stern Villains Justice to the Crowd dispense, And none be hang'd for Rogues, but Men of Worth and Sence. Such are the good Designs the Whiggish Clan Have long been lab'ring to compleat in vain; Those Patriots who so earnestly contend For Holland, and oppose the glorious End Our Royal Nursing-Mother has in view, For Her own Kingdoms and Her Allies too: Therefore since She has timely taken care, That Britain shall enjoy an ample Share Of the last Fruits we must expect to glean, Now Europe calls her bloody Harvest in, Must we, like thankless Rebels, cry, the Dutch Have got too little, and ourselves too much? Must we, like Traytors, snarl at the encrease Of our long injur'd Country's Happiness, And think our only Rivals merit more Than us, the spendthrift Bubbles of the War? Must we from Anna and our Duty swerve, Because sh'as done much more than we deserve, And blame her for establishing in us That Trade which Holland wanted to ingross? Is this your Justice to the gen'rous Hand That gives you Peace, and to your native Land? Would you betray your Country to the States, Ye treach'rous Vermin, worse than Dogs or Cats, And satiate your Revenge against the Throne, By slighting what the Queen has made our own, And cav'ling at the Articles of Peace 'Cause Holland has no more, and we no less? Shame on such Weeds, ingrateful to the Soil That nurs'd you up to be so rank and vile, Till your proud Heads forget your native Earth, And scorn the fruitful Ground that gave you Birth. So disobedient Children bred awry, When vex'd, will in their Parents Faces fly. And with ingrateful impudence requite The tender Care that rais'd 'em to their height. Have we in War spent Twenty Years and more, To make all Europe, but ourselves, secure, Succour'd Imperial Charles in his Distress, And labour'd to promote his Happiness, Deny'd ourselves that Trade which our Ally, The Dutch, took care to manage by the Bye, Subdu'd so many Towns at the expence Of English Blood, to strengthen their Defence; And must the Troops, pertaining to the Crown Of Britain, be refus'd to pass through one? And, to the great dishonour of our Queen, Be stop'd by M????????'s trusty Friend E??????e, Who, as a Spy, came over to cabal With Faction, and their darling G?l, That they the better might consult of Means To undermine good Anna's bless'd Designs, Knowing a Peace would strip off the Disguise, Long worn by our Domestick Enemies, And make our false seditious Friends appear More ravenous than Tyger, Wolf, or Bear. Nor could the G?n H?o, and His G?c, With all the Junto, find a safer place To meet in, than a Pile which long has stood A s?d P?e, facing T?n R?d, Where dwells a grave P?s?n, who can heal The wounded Soul or Body, when it's ill; But owes his present Station, some agree, More to his Physick than Divinity; And by a Dose most seas'nably apply'd, Remov'd one great obstruction of his Pride. So have I seen, at Billiards, in my days Of Youth, the hindmost Ball, that gives the Chase, Send 'tother to the Hole, and take it's Place. Within this ancient Palace of Renown, Much honour'd and much envy'd by the Gown, The swarthy fighting Prince, not long before He left, for Foreign Fields, the British Shore, With his disgusted Falling Friend, confer'd In private, whilst the wise Domestick Lord, Commanded that his Gates should close be shut, And none permitted to go in or out, Besides some certain Whiggish L????s, whose Brains Were useful in the weighty Conference. Thus all was hush, till they had hatch'd some grand Design, to ruffle the Affairs in hand, And crav'd a formal Blessing on the Scheme, Projected to confront the Diadem, By undermining Peace, prolonging War, And pulling down their Foe the T?r, Thus were those dark Intrigues at present found So troublesome, first hatch'd on holy Ground, And all those Evils consecrated here, Which now abroad so mischievous appear. 'Tis strange the highest Order of the Gown, Fed by the Church, and honour'd by the Crown, Should side with open Enemies to both, Who ridicule their Faith and hate their Cloth. But many deviate from the Names they bear, And Wolves too oft do Shepherds cloathing wear. Well may we wonder Britain should contain Such Herds of Monsters in the Shape of Men, Who glut their Malice with their Country's Blood, And make their Markets of the Publick Good. But the discerning Eye may eas'ly see The cause of all their present Villany, And why they now oppose the Peace in hand, For War, destructive to their native Land. Look round the bleeding Nation and behold What treach'rous Upstarts triumph in our Gold, Who, since the Revolution, till of late, Brow-beat the Church, misteer'd the Helm of State, Abus'd all Offices of Pow'r and Trust, And made the wicked'st Actions pass for just: At Home oppress'd us, bubbl'd us Abroad, Grew Pow'rful by Trick, and Rich by Fraud; Incroach'd upon the Throne by daring Means, And trait'rously misus'd the best of Queens; Bore down the Constitution, Branch by Branch, And did us much more mischief than the French, Still taking care, by some new Act or Clause, To muzzle Justice and restrain the Laws; Chusing much rather tacitly to own Their Guilt in safety, than to boldly run The Risque of that due scandalous Reward, They knew they had notoriously deserv'd. So Roman Harlots, to their Priests, confess Their gainful lushious Sins and Wantoness, That when absolv'd they may renew their Lust, And gratify afresh their vitious Gust. Our vacant Pulpits they took care to fill With Guides of a Dissenting Principle, And rais'd up Holy Fathers, who were known To be born Enemies to Church and Throne, Whose Doctrines tended to the bane of both, And were themselves destructive to their Cloth. Well might the Flock be mis'rably betray'd, When Wolves and Foxes were our Shepherds made; Whilst our true Pastors Hands and Tongues were ty'd, And by revolving Dunces villify'd. The Millions rais'd to expedite the War, Were still but made Preparatives for more, And only serv'd to let the Nation see What the next Year's oppressive Tax must be, To purchase Towns for Holland, that, at length, We might repent our Weakness and their Strength Whilst all that to the Share of Britain falls, Are ragged Trophies, to adorn our Halls, And those so dearly bought, that a few more, At the same Price, would make us weak and poor. Nor were these all the Blessings we enjoy'd, Whilst none but Whigs were in the State imploy'd, For the vast Sums long levy'd to uphold The War, were by such Birdlime-Fingers told, That mighty Heaps, as will e'relong appear, Were by the Stewards sunk, from Year to Year, As their dear trusty Friends, the Dutch, can tell, And as the Bank of Venice knows full well; Yet kept the Crown as bare, as if the Queen Had been their Subject, they Her Sovereign. All which imperious Usage of the Throne, When they had made the Sword and Purse their own, And such Collusions, that no injur'd Land, But Britain, e'er so patiently sustain'd, Their Penetration craftily foresaw No longer could escape the Fangs of Law, Than whilst their Party could maintain the Pow'r And, by a War, their Villanies obscure. A War, by which they rais'd the frothy Scum Of Britain to boil over us at Home, Whilst their great Warrior, by his Truncheon, aw'd Our distant Troops, and bubbl'd us abroad. A War, which thin'd the Nation of her best And bravest Youth, and beggar'd half the rest; And when the Taxes and the Sword had brought Thousands of prosp'rous Families to nought, A Swarm of Vagrants, scandalously poor, Lousy and Lazy were invited o'er, To teach us how to mortify our Guts, And live, like ruin'd Slaves on Herbs and Roots. A War, that set a D?s o'er a Q?n, And rais'd a D?e above his Sovereign Lifted Dissenters higher than the Church, And turn'd our wholesome Laws to Rods of Birch. A War, that, if continu'd, will advance A Commonwealth, instead of low'ring France, And make us humble Irreligious Slaves, To Atheistick Fools and Whiggish Knaves; For should we still support a Foreign Host, And the Low-Church regain the Pow'r they've lost No Hanover Succession shall have place, Dominion must be founded then in Grace, And grateful Ch?l, and his pious Wife, Be made our Genralissimo's for Life. 'Tis for these Reasons our Domestick Foes Cry out for War, and timely Peace oppose. A Peace so Equal, Glorious and Just, For all that do in Anna's Conduct trust, That none can cavil at its Terms, but such As want to sell old England to the Dutch. A Peace, wherein we shall be happy made, In all the Branches of our Foreign Trade, And, by whose Means we surely shall become Pow'rful Abroad and Wealthy soon at Home. A Peace, that will unriddle all the base Designs and Myst'ries of the Whiggish Race, And make those impious Managers appear Black as the gloomy Shades tow'rds which they steer. A Peace, that will our Home-Divisions heal, And cure at once those smarting Wounds we feel, Make us Unanimous, our Sov'reign Great, And deal forth Blessings to the meanest State. What thanks must Anna then from Europe claim, Whose Godlike Wisdom has obtain'd the same? What Pray'rs from Britain, rescu'd by her Care, From all the Mis'ries of a crafty War? Wherein Her int'rest had been long betray'd By those Her Arms too prosperous had made, Not for the Nation, or their gen'rous Queen, But for themselves, the most unjust of Men, To that good Princess, who had nurs'd the Snakes Till she, in time, repented her Mistakes; And as she caught them nibling at her Crown, In Anger, cast the treach'rous Serpents down, So far'd the frozen Vermin, when he bit The Gen'rous Hand that warm'd and cherish'd it. What can our Tongues express or Pens proclaim In honour of the Great Immortal Dame, To whom, beneath the King of Kings, we owe All we enjoy, and more than yet we know; The least a grateful Land can do or say, Is to be humbly thankful, and obey, And by unfeign'd Submission to her wise Provision for Her Subjects and Allies, Let the kind Princess, to her comfort see Our Love, our Gratitude, and Loyalty, That all Her miscreant Enemies at Home May seek her Mercy to prevent their Doom. And own their Guilt, thro' Penitence, or Fear Of Justice, and no longer persevere; And those Abroad, who at the present join Her Foes Domestick in their base Design, Admire the Conduct of the Royal Dame, And tremble when they hear Great Anna's Name. Next to the best of Queens we must adore The Wisdom of her chosen Minister, Who, with such Caution, sheaths the British Sword, That downy Peace may timely be restor'd: None e'er was better qualify'd to raise A Sinking Nation, lab'ring in Distress, Whose painful Bowels have so long been knaw'd By Vipers, worse than all her Foes Abroad: No Mortal can with more exactness tread The Paths mysterious Provicence has laid: His wonderful Successes plainly shew He knows the Lab'rinth, and has gain'd the Clue. What Mazes has he trod, what Hazards run, What Threats endur'd, what Good for Britain done! And in the worst of Times made all secure, When Faction had ingross'd the Sovreign Pow'r; And when most Patriots of Success dispair'd, The Work appear'd so doubtful and so hard. What Honour, therefore, and what Praise is due To him alone, that durst the Task pursue! And would not be deter'd, but forward prest, Tho' cow'rdly Stabs were offer'd at his Breast, And groundless Calumnies diffus'd Abroad, To poyson and inflame the wav'ring Croud, That all his great Efforts might be withstood, And dawning Peace be drown'd in Seas of Blood: Yet no vile Artifice could stop his Way, Or give his just Designs the least delay; No envious Shocks obstruct the End desir'd, His Soul was for the Work so well inspir'd. Go on, great Man, thou Wonder of the Age, Whose Rise does Britain's Happiness presage, Proceed and prosper, guarded by the Throne, And finish what so nobly thou'st begun. Give England Peace, beneath bless'd Anna's Care, And put a Glorious Period to the War; Confirm the gainful Project thou hast laid, And to the Southern Bounds extend our Trade, That the good End of all, for which we wait, May shew Thee what Thou art, that's truly Great; And make Thy blushing Enemies confess, In spite of Malice, that Thou art no less. Then shall the British Kingdoms gladly own, As well as now, the Wonders thou hast done. Next to good Anna's Deeds thy Worth proclaim, And raise Thee lasting Monuments of Fame; For now Britannia sees she soon must rue Her Essex, had she not a Cecil too. A short Reprimand to a Prodigal Heir. Why, my old Friend, are you so proud, As soon as bless'd with an Estate, They laugh, to whom you oft have bow'd, To see your Neck so stiff of late. What tho' your Father had the care To wealthy grow, by wretched means, You're but the Asse that's doom'd to bear The golden Burthen of his Sins. Then prithee be not over-run With Pride, it only makes your Foes Remember, Happy is the Son Whose Father to the Devil goes. Upon the Prospct of Peace. By J. K. Esq; Hail Pious Queen! from thy auspicious Reign Your Britain hopes for halcyon Days again, Depress'd by Wars, and a long Chain of Woes, Her Treasure wasted by insulting Foes, She now looks up tow'rds Anna, in distress, And in her Conduct hopes for Happiness, Rears up her drooping Head, and smiles to see So near a Prospect of Felicity; Which sudden unexpected pleasing view, She owes alone, Great Queen, to Heav'n and You, Who have, at once, a glorious Peace restor'd, And into Ploughshears turn'd the useless Sword, Whilst Faction grins to see her Brood outdone, And blinking throws her Envy at the Throne, Unable to behold the dazling Scene, So wisely manag'd by so bright a Queen, Whose Predecessors lop'd the Hydra's Head, But She alone hath struck the Monster dead, Rescu'd her Kingdoms at one Blow, and aw'd Her Enemies at home, and those abroad, And by her just Resentments lets 'em see The danger of provoking Majesty. So kind forgiving Jove in Mercy bears With Sinners, hoping for repenting Tears; But when we glory in our impious Deeds, He thunders Vengeance on our daring Heads. No more shall foreign Fields drink British Blood, Or Armies prey upon their Country's good. No more shall fatal War draw Widows Tears, Or youthful Thousands drop at half their Years. No more shall Sons be from their Parents torn, Or loving Wives their absent Husbands mourn. No more shall Dunkirk's plund'ring Privateers, Ruin the Merchant or augment his Fears, Since our bless'd Queen gives universal Peace, And, as She ought, commands the British Seas. Then rise, Britania, rescu'd from the Sword, Thy former Glories are again restor'd; Bow down thy Head, adore the Queen that reigns, And teach thy factious Sons obedience, That with united Hearts we all may pray, Good Anna long may bear the Sov'reign sway, Whose Wisdom hath redeem'd and set us free From Slav'ry, Knav'ry, and Presbytery. An Epigram. By the same Hand. Justice by Whigs, by idle Spendthrifts Gold, And mourning Love b'ing banish'd by the Old, These exil'd Deities in Council meet, That each on Earth may find a safe Retreat; Justice in Ox?d's Heart secures her rest, The wanton God resolves on O?nd's Breast, And Gold, for safety, flies to M?'s Chest. [If Bread and Cheese and Onions] Since some Lady was so kind to send an Answer to the Countryman's description of his Mistress, in order to oblige her, we have introduc'd it with some little Alteration. If Bread and Cheese and Onions Can make a Rogue a Saint, And Shitrodox Compinions His wicked Actions paint. Then Gaffer you may flout me, As one that looks but odly, And think I've nought about me That's fit to please the Godly. You first impare me to a Colt, But may the Murrain take me, If ever such a Looby Dolt As you, shall ever back me. Next you do zay I'm like a Cow, And for my Udders scoff me, But I'll lead Apes in Hell e're yow Shall have the milking of me. What tho' my Market-place is tan'd, Like Flitch of rusty Bacon, If e'er you hope you shall command A Rashier, you're mistaken. I don't pretend to have a Skin As fair as Madam Juno, Tho' reas'd without, 'tis red within, But that is more than you know. I'd need be fond of being yours, You're such a tidy Fellow, Whose Bristles, like your sandy Boar's, Are tip'd with Sunburnt yellow. Go thrash your Barly, tread your Mow, Or hunt your Hogs with Booby, For I am no such silly Sow, To wed with such a Looby. The Justice and the Bawd. Madam, you plainly find, quoth Justice Clod, The Evidence can swear that you're a Bawd; And, let me tell you, were I so hard-hearted To bind you over, you'd be surely carted; Don't be so rash to hazard the Disgrace, E'en make it up, for 'tis an ugly Case; Take my Advice, commute with them and pay, 'Twill prove the wisest and the cheapest way; For if it comes before the Bench, depend on't, A Whipping will be certainly the end on't. But pray, your Worship, hear me but a little, Quoth Madam, these are Rogues that rob the Spittle Degraded Pimps, vile mercenary Fellows, Notorious Villains that would shame a Gallows, And should their Oaths be taken in such Cases, Thousands behind a Cart would make wry Faces, Who wear brocaded Sattins, ride in Coaches, And live in Pomp by managing Debauches; Therefore I hope your Worship will excuse me This time, and let them not too hardly use me; For now the Lawyers are the Circuit gone, And Rakes, in shoals, to Dunkirk daily run, Trading's so bad I scarce can buy Strong-waters, Or find Provisions for myself and Daughters. Quoth Justice Clod, I know the Times are hard, Give 'em but half a Guinea to reward Their trouble. Gentlemen, she keeps no common Brothel, pray take it, she's a civil Woman, And, for the future, 'less you find a Riot Within her House, pray let her live in quiet. Quoth Madam, there's your Money, Gentlemen, Tho' I've not got so much the Lord knows when. I thank your Worship for your tender Heart, 'Tis more your Goodness, Sir, than my Desert. The Tobacco Sot. An Epigram. Says Jack, a dry consumptive smoaking Sot, Whose Mouth with Weed was always glowing hot, Where shall I go, alas, when Death shall come, And with his rawbon'd Clutches seal my Doom? Faith, replies Tom, there can no Heaven be, Without Tobacco, for such Sots as thee. Nor need you fear a Hell when you expire, You've dealt so much on Earth in Smoak and Fire. An Enigma. Possession gives me Right, Birth gives thee thine, 'Tis yours by Nature, but by Law 'tis mine. Yours is but Title, mine is real Fact; You only can pretend, I've pow'r to act. Therefore, since you have neither Law nor Might I claim by an indisputable Right.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Numb. IV. An humble Offering to the Best of Queens, upon the Consummation of Peace. Long since Thy Royal Grandsire strove in vain To quell those Rebels that disturb'd his Reign; He fell a Martyr in the just Defence Of God's true Church and his own Innocence; And rather than betray His Royal Trust, Left his proud Foes to trample o'er his Dust: But Thou, Great Anna, hast at once subdu'd Those Factious Crocadiles that weep for Blood, Rescu'd from Danger both the Church and Throne, Recover'd all that justly is Thy own; And hast perform'd more Wonders to restore A sinking Nation to its ancient Pow'r, Than Royal Goodness e'er could do before. Go on, Bless'd Queen, and Prosper, till the Name Of Whig shall make each Rebel blush for Shame; Restrain thy wonted Mercy, and command The Sword of Justice with an awful Hand; For Lenity to those that persevere, By Rebels always is misconstru'd Fear; They triumph o'er their Princes when too tame, And, in a Monarch, Moderation blame, Turn all his brightest Vertues into Vice, And deem his Clemency but Cowardice. Then raise, O mighty Prince! thy Scepter high, And with becoming Scorn the Whigs defy; Exert thy Pow'r as much as they their Spleen, And make the Rebels know thou art their Queen; Let not their Treach'ry to the Church and Thee, Pass off in Silence with Impunity; Let no vile Traytor to their Native Land, Enjoy what's reap'd by a rapacious Hand, But force the Miscreants to refund that Wealth, Gain'd in the time of War by Fraud and Stealth; And punish them as Theives deserve who ply At Fires, to make Advantages thereby, Where, under a pretence of Aid, they cheat The Sufferer and make his Loss more great. Let not Whig Threats thy Royal Courage daunt, Thy just Designs can no Protection want; Heav'n hath shown Wonders to preserve Thee thus, And Thou, Great Queen, hast done the same for us; At such a time when Faction storm'd the Throne, And proudly aim'd to make thy Pow'r their own: But Thou, O gracious Queen! by Heav'n inspir'd, Hast gain'd that Point which all good Men desir'd, Rescu'd the Church and set thy People free From Chains, prepar'd by Foes to God and Thee; And when the Nation groan'd beneath the smart Of an expensive War prolong'd by Art, Thy English-Heart a glorious Peace procur'd, And heal'd at once the gashes of the Sword, Giving to all the Christian World a view Of happier Days than yet they ever knew, Blessings alone ascrib'd to Heav'n and You. Proceed, Great Princess, as Thou hast begun, Crush angry Faction and assert thy Throne, Raise up the Church above the reach of Foes, And with new Laws her ancient Rights enclose, Repair the Breaches which the Whigs have made, And punish all the ill Designs they've laid, Bend their stiff Necks to thy Imperial Sway, Teach them that Duty they abhor to pay, And by a legal force compel them to obey. Then to the World Thou wilt appear most blest Of Queens that e'er the British Throne possest; All will admire thy Wisdom, and adore, Thro' Love or Fear, thy Person and thy Pow'r, Who hath perform'd such Wonders, to advance The Church and perfect our Deliverance. In War no Monarch could have more Success, None reap more Glory and enjoy it less: No Royal Victor in the End obtain A nobler Peace to crown a Prosp'rous Reign; And none with greater Art and Ease o'ercome A Faction prodigal of Pow'r at home, When all believ'd, who saw how far they'd run, The Task too hard to be perform'd so soon; But Heav'n, who with Resentment cast an Eye Upon their base Designs tow'rds Majesty, Inspir'd thy Royal Vertues, e're too late, With awful Courage, for a Work so great, Which, in a sinful Land could ne'er have been So well perform'd but by so Just a Queen. May hourly Pray'rs, for thy Eternal Reign, To God, be offer'd by the best of Men; And may their good Examples teach the rest To truly know how much in Thee they're blest, That all may humbly to thy Scepter bow, And to thy Throne sincere Allegiance vow. Domestick Jars and Feuds for ever cease, That our Obedience may compleat thy Ease, Who makes us truly happy in a glorious Peace. An Epitaph on a certain Great Man, who broke his Heart upon the change of the Ministry. Here lies a Turncoat, in this holy Place, Whose Parish-Chin disgrac'd his noble Face; A Tory once, but turn'd a Whig for Gain, Whose Foolish Looks disguis'd the cunning Man: At Cards, no Gamester with this Rook could deal, He'd play the Knave, and yet the Knave conceal; Won mighty Sums, yet was by Fortune crost, And broke his Heart, because one Game he lost. Here let him lie lamented now he's dead, Because his timely Exit sav'd his Head From Justice, unto whom 'twas forfeited. A Bitter Draught for a Whig with a foul Stomach. I Let the Whigs rave like mad, And the Loyal be glad, That our Politick Wars now are ended, Carry'd on to pull down Both the Church and the Crown, That the Government might be mended. II But they gallup'd too fast For their Speed long to last, As their Fathers had oft done before 'em, And so Jaded the Land, When they'd got the Whip-hand, That they run down the Nation that bore 'em. III But now the whole Race Of Pretenders to Grace, Are from Britain's old Saddle dismounted, And those Saints who, like Knaves, Would have made us their Slaves, Are but Fools for their Management counted. IV Therefore, since they are down, And the Day is our own, Let's remember their way of Chastising, And to make 'em Obey, Shew 'em true English Play, And still give 'em a Blow when they're rising. V Let them prattle like Fools, To their credulous Tools, That we quickly shall have the Pretender, They may e'en as well boast, That they'll raise up the Ghost Of Old Nol, by a New Witch of Endor. VI It was always the Cant Of each Politick Saint, With some Popish Design to amuse us, When themselves had on Foot, Some Fanatical Plot, With a Godly Intent to abuse us. VII When the Saints of the Land Cry the Pope is at hand, It is time for the Crown to be fearful, That a Dutch Commonwealth Will creep on us by stealth, If the State are not wonderful careful. VIII Therefore let us not mind What they talk for a Blind, But be arm'd against them and their Evils; For the sanctify'd Race Have a Snake in the Grass, When they fright us with Popes and with Devils. IX Remember Saint Oats, And their Shaftsbury Plots, Which were charg'd upon Rome by the Pious, When the Protestant Breed Had with Rumbold agreed, To Assassinate Charles at the Rye-House. X Then who would give Ear, When we've nothing to fear But themselves, to the Shams they've Projected, When their Aim is to down With the Church and the Crown, Whilst our Eyes the wrong way are directed. XI Then let's be too wise To be gull'd by their Lies, Since we find 'tis the Way of the Righteous, To possess us with fear, That the Lyon is near, When themselves are the Dogs that would bite us. The Plain-dealing Lover. Madam, you Vow and Swear you ne'er was free With any Mortal but your 'Spouse and me, That is, you ne'er expos'd your Female Charms, As you affirm, to any other's Arms. Have you not often to your Husband said, And swore, You never wrong'd his Nuptial-Bed? How then can I give Credit to your Oath, That know you're false to him, why not to both? For the same Lust that makes you sin with one, Will render you so easy to be won By more, that Two cannot content a Mind Infected with an Itch of being kind. Our sep'rate Int'rests we can ne'er unite, We only Love for sake of Love's delight, And when that tempts us shall be apt to break The strongest Ties that you and I can make. Therefore, tho' I am Young and you are Fair, And both to each a mutual Liking bear, Let us all frothy needless Vows avoid, For neither know how soon we may be cloy'd: Besides, whoever breaks their Nuptial-Troth, Can ne'er be bound to Justice by an Oath: Tis Pleasure makes us covet to Embrace, The same will make us like some newer Face. Then let us Love as long as e'er we can, That is, till you affect some other Man, Or I by some fresh Beauty am decoy'd, To leave what must grow Stale when long enjoy'd; For Woman is by Nature giv'n to Change, And Man, in spite of Conscience, prone to Range. Then Swear not that you are or will be true, You're False to one, and may be so to two: Besides, I cannot be confin'd to you. THE Extravagant Drunkard's Wish. Had I my Wish I would distend my Guts As wide as from the North to Southern Skies, And have, at once, as many Mouths and Throats, As old Briarius Arms, or Argos Eyes. The raging Sea's unpallatable Brine, That drowns so many Thousands in a Year, I'd turn into an Ocean of good Wine, And for my Cup would chuse the Hemisphere: Would then perform the Wager Xanthus laid, In spight of all the Rivers flowing Streams, Swill, till I piss'd a Deluge, then to Bed, And please my thirsty Soul with Small-Beer Dreams. Thus Drink and Sleep, and waking Swill again, Till I had drunk the Sea-Gods Cellars dry, Then rob the Niggard Neptune and his Train Of Tritons, of that Wealth they now enjoy. Kiss the whole Nerides, and make the Jades Sing all their charming Songs to please my Ear, And whether Flesh or Fish, Thornbacks or Maids, I'd make the Gypsies kind thro' Love or Fear. And when thus Wicked and thus Wealthy grown For nothing good, I'd turn Rebellious Whig, Pull e'ery Monarch headlong from his Throne, And with the Prince of Darkness make a League, That he and I, and all the Whigs beside, Might rend down Churches, Crowns in pieces tare, Exert our Malice, gratify our Pride, And settle Satan's Kingdom e'erywhere. Upon the late Learned and Ingenious Dr. William King. Rowze up ye British Bards, no longer sleep In envious Silence, but awake and weep! Shake off those fading Laurels from your Brows, Glean'd by dull Farce at the degen'rate House, Or by worse Op'ras introduc'd to please Fantastick Slaves to Folly, Pride, and Ease: No longer upon Playhouse Praise depend, Where Wise-men laugh at what the Fools commend: Nor think you've Title to the Bays, because You've oft been flatter'd with unjust Applause; But to Apollo with Devotion fly, Confess your Wants and beg a fresh supply Of that Celestial Fire on none bestow'd But Fav'rites of the kind Harmonious God, Such as the late Learn'd King, whose teeming Brain Gave Life Immortal to his artful Pen; Till tir'd with an unthankful Jarring Age, He fled his Muse, forsook the worldly Stage, And left Apollo's Rival Sons to vie Their poor remains of Wit in Elegy. So the Coy Nymph, whose Charms each Swain admires, When close pursu'd, to distant Shades retires, Where, undisturb'd, in Solitude she stays, And leaves the Rival Crowd to sing her Praise. Therefore since King, who once was the delight Of all who read what he vouchsaf'd to write, Hath shook off dull Mortality to soar Among the Blest, where Time shall be no more, Embrace with ardour the capacious Theme, And shew how much he merited Esteem; Whose golden Writings will direct the way, And teach you how to Think, and what to Say: Record his Labours in immortal Verse, And sing his Vertues round his pious Hearse; Remember all his Learning and his Worth, And mourn him back to his maternal Earth; Tell what a Vein of Wit, what Chain of Thought Enliven'd and adorn'd whate'er he wrote; What Care he took in Ovid's Art of Love, To change the Serpent to a harmless Dove, And give us in a modest English Dress, What in the Roman was obscene and base; As if the British Bard was proud to shew Himself the greater Poet of the two; Who, as an Honour to that ancient School Where Rev'rend Busby long maintain'd the Rule, Bequeath'd his worthy Reliques to be laid In those learn'd Cloisters where he first was bred. There let him rest in Peace, but still admir'd By all whom the kind Muses have inspir'd; Whilst the fam'd Products of his matchless Pen Shall, to the last, their native Worth retain, Preserve their Beauties fresh without decay, And ever shine around his mould'ring Clay. Nor was his Wit, tho' chearfully dispos'd, With Christian Bounds and Fences uninclos'd; For none whose sprightly Genius flow'd his way, To Holy Things could greater def'rence pay; None in Religion's sacred Vineyard spent More Time and Labour to improve Content; Or with a truer Zeal could recommend Those heav'nly Truths by Wits so oft prophan'd, That to the Poet we may justly join, Not the Civilian only but Divine: In one rich Breast he made the Trine agree, And was profoundly learn'd in all the Three: By Nature much inclin'd to others Good, And flow'd with Bounty, Love, and Gratitude; Was kind to Friends, for whom he much impair'd His Fortune, which too lib'rally they shar'd; Yet, tho' his Gen'rous Hand reduc'd his Store, H'enjoy'd too much Content to e'er be Poor; And when Dame Fortune prov'd the most unkind, Would still be rich in Thought and great in Mind Thus, like the wise Philosophers of old, Who taught us to despise the Charms of Gold, He did the gauling Cares of Life defeat, By Contemplation and a safe Retreat; In which Angelick State he stood prepar'd To suffer all that could on Earth be fear'd; As if compleatly arm'd against his Fate, And more than could on humane Nature wait, Pruning those Talents Heaven had bestow'd, And to Industry new Improvements ow'd, Till he had conquer'd each politer part Of Learning, and was skill'd in e'ery Art, Yet ne'er affected to be thought more wise Than they who could not to his Knowledge rise, Scorning to tyrannize o'er those he found Too weak or modest to maintain their ground, Cooly forbearing rather to contend, Than argue to expose an erring Friend, Tho' other Wits their utmost strength advance, To triumph o'er mistaken Ignorance, And hazard Friendship only to appear Too vainly Learn'd or wittily Severe. But King disdaining such pedantick Pride, Would tacitly his own Perfections hide, Much rather than sollicit human Praise, By making others, not his Equals, less; Yet, like a kind Preceptor, took delight To set a misled Adversary right; But did it by such means as must convince Mistaken Zeal, without the least offence; With no ill Nature would his Wit debauch, But modestly correct without Reproach. To thee, O Julius! I submit the rest, Thou know'st his Worth and all his Vertues best, Who in his Sickness, like a faithful Friend, Lent him thy kind Assistance to his End, And by the artful Helps by thee apply'd, Sustain'd weak Nature long before he dy'd; Thy skilful Hand still gave the Worthy Breath And Courage to resist approaching Death, Till watchful Fate advantage took at last, And to the Ground the bleeding Victim Dy'd vomiting of Blood. cast. So costly Fabricks which appear so fair, And Monuments which now so beauteous are, Must fall at last, in spight of all repair. Nor didst thou leave him when bereft of Life, But acted like a fond forsaken Wife, With Grief distracted, follow'd to his Grave, And mourn'd the loss of him no Art could save: Therefore, dear Widow-Friend, to thee alone Belongs the Elegiack Praise of him that's gone; None but thy amicable Muse can claim The right of weeping, as she sings his Fame: O prune her Wings that she aloft may tow'r, And borrow Aid of some superior Pow'r, That in Seraphick Numbers she may sing Aloud, the Praises of Immortal King. O Julius dwell upon a Theme so good, That from thy Friendship, Grief and Gratitude, Others may labour to refine their Dross, And learn of thee to mourn so great a Loss. Upon Singing Birds in a Prisoner's Room. Poor Innocents! how suits my Case with theirs, Since either Species has its Iron-Bars! But yet how different is their Case from mine, They sing amidst their Bonds, while I repine. Great Jove! Mankind their Liberty allow, And condescend to hear thy Votary's Vow, Grant that these Birds to Men may be transfer'd, Or else vouchsafe to make this Man a Bird. W. P. On Belinda setting the Seed of an Amaranth, and lamenting the Fate of Annuals. O lovely Amaranth! from thy Seed break forth, And rise in full Perfection at thy Birth; Unbosom all thy Beauties to the Light, With swelling Pride engage Belinda's sight; Nor mourn the loss of the departing Sun, Or think thy Odour or thy Lustre gone, Each Ray that darts from her all-pow'rful Eyes, Autumnal Suns and April Show'rs supplies. T. W. A Congratulatory Poem to a certain Gentleman lately Honour'd by Her Majesty. When Storms arise, and all above looks dark, And Rocks and Shelves surround the rowling Bark, The Sailors grow dispirited with fear, Till Stars auspicious do aloft appear, And peeping through the breaking Clouds portend The threat'ning Tempest to be near its end; Then comforted with hopes they boldly steer, And Joy to think fair Weather is so near. So when a sinking Nation dreads her Doom, 'Twixt Enemies abroad and worse at home, Dejected Thousands look, alas, dismay'd, To see their Country beggar'd and betray'd, Reflect on past Prosperity with pain, And mov'd by present Fears aloud complain. But when such Stars, such Patriots as you, To the Throne Loyal, to your Country True, Arise in Glory and adorn the Stage, Your gen'rous Smiles a happy Change presage, And in the midst of Danger let us see The glimm'rings of a near Prosperity; Such as revive a Nation in distress, Enlarge our Hopes and make our Suff'rings less, At such a time when blended Factions grin And labour to prolong the bloody Scene. But Royal Anna's Wisdom, and the Care Of that Great Man her chosen Minister, Back'd by such Friends as you, still give us hopes, And if they fail our Constitution drops: But all the wond'rous Steps already made, Shew the Foundation of the Structure laid With so much Art and Strength, that 'twill sustain The greatest Work of Anna's glorious Reign; A Work that must successfully go on, Since Heav'n itself hath fix'd the Corner-Stone; For, tho' unfinish'd, we may see there's more Of God in e'ery Stroke than humane Pow'r. So Prophets, when inspir'd with Pens divine, Almighty Dictates shew in e'ery Line. Nor could the Gracious Queen vouchsafe her Friends A greater Instance of the Glorious Ends Her Royal English Heart has now in view, Than in the Honour she's conferr'd on You; Who need no gaudy Herald to proclaim, Or artful Tongue to magnify your Fame: No Poet's Pen to set your Vertues forth, Your Actions have enough confirm'd your Worth: Your Hospitable House, where Plenty flows, At once your Bounty and Discretion shows: Your wise Deportment in your present Trust, Declares you Gen'rous, Circumspect and Just. The late great Honour to your Merits done, Bears witness of your Duty to the Throne, Whilst the whole Conduct of your Life defies The Malice of your Whiggish Enemies; And by Reverberation wounds the Hearts Of Faction with their own ill-natur'd Darts; As the firm Rock rebounds the Pebble-stone, Against the Breast of him by whom 'twas thrown. May all your Loyal Wishes come to pass, And downy Peace instead of War take place, That the proud Whigs, those Vultures in disguise, Who always threaten Mischief when they rise, May perch no more on Churches, prey on Kings, But droop their Heads and hang their soaring Wings; And Loyal Worthies, like yourself, who scorn, For Ill-got Wealth, to serve a Factious Turn; B'enabl'd to recover, e're too late, Their bleeding Country from a wretched State, That when a glorious Peace is well secur'd, And Men of Worth shall only be impowr'd, In London the Pretorian Chair may prove Your least Great Honour, and your next Remove. May the Fair Partner of your Cares and Joys, Happy in you, and you in such a Choice, All Honours, Comforts, and Enjoyments share, Due to the Vertues of so blest a Pair; That neither may determine whose Delights Are most compleat, the Lady's or the Knight's; But both from all Indispositions free, Maintain the ballance of Felicity, And to a pitch of such Contentment rise, That you may turn this World to Paradise, And taste of Heav'n before you mount the Skies. A necessary Caution to a worthless Prodigal, who fancies himself Great without Authority, Wise without Knowledge, and Rich without Money. Why, haughty Wretch! art thou so proud and vain, To look awry on others with Disdain? Why dost thou damn that Fellow for a Fool, When thee thyself art so profoundly dull? Why brand that blust'ring Bully with the Name Of Coward, when thou know'st thou art the same? What makes thee strut, command, and look so big, Since thus adorn'd with new unpaid-for Wig? And by some trusting cozen'd Taylor made, According to the Mode, so spruce a Blade, When all the Jauntee Outside which you boast, Consists of borrow'd Plumes at others cost; And thy unpolish'd Inside, at the best, Furnish'd with nothing but a faithless Breast, Where only filthy Lusts and Passions dwell, Like Dirt and Cobwebs in a Hermet's Cell. Porters, 'tis true, thy Quality mistake, And, bowing, call thee Master, when they spake. The Drawer Sirs thee up at e'ery Word, And Tapster Tom pays Homage to thy Sword. Maim'd begging Sailers, dogging at thy Heels, Give thee the Style of Captain, in Moorefields, And pray, perhaps, Your Honour, as you pass, To bless them with your Charity in Brass. These Flatterers, in Thought may make thee Great, Because they're Strangers to thy vagrant State; Prompt thee to vainly fancy that they see Not half so much in others as in thee: But he, alas, who knows thee, well observes Thy Pride's too soaring for a Wretch that starves, And sits amaz'd to hear so little Worth Set others Failings with such envy forth. As if bewilder'd with a vain Conceit Of thy own Learning, Honesty, and Wit, When none but thy mistaken self can find One real Vertue seated in thy Mind, Except the lewd Delights of Punk and Glass, For wise Pursuits and great Atchievements pass; And tricking Frauds impos'd upon a Friend, Are Deeds that to Immortal Glory tend. How therefore canst thou proudly Pish and Poh, And snarl at what thy Betters say or do, Rake into other's Dunghils that the Steem Of thy own Filth, may less offensive seem, Injure the Worthy, at their Merits snort, And make their Vertues thy indecent sport? So mercenary Strumpets, void of Shame, On the chast Damsel cast the odious Name Of Private Whore, too cunning to be caught, The silent Sow that drinks up all the Draught. But prithee, Friend, if thou deserv'st that Stile, E'er thou blam'st others, be thyself less Vile. For he that spreads his Neighbour's Faults should be From the same Errors and Aspersions free; Else every Scandal that he throws, rebounds Upon himself, and his own Conscience wounds, And makes his Follies, who reflects the same On others, terminate in twice the Shame Of him who seeks to wrong his Neighbours Fame. A Hymn sung before Her Majesty, by the Charity-Children, at Kinsington. Bless'd Monarch of Eternal Day! Enthron'd in Glory and in Peace, To Thee we humbly Sing, and pray Thy Grace may with our Strength encrease. O King of Kings, Almighty Lord Of Princes, save the Queen, Ordain'd to sheath the cruel Sword And change the bloody Scene. Chorus. All Honour, Glory, Praise and Power, To Thee, O Lord of Host, Who does, in Anna's Peace, restore The sundry Blessings we before, In forreign Wars, had lost. O Heaven! bless the Royal Dame, Who stretches forth Her bounteous Hand To feed, and teach us to proclaim Thy Mercies thro' the British Land. Preserve Her as the only Dove, That to her People brings The Olive-Branch of Peace and Love, Whence human Comfort springs. Chorus. All Honour, &amp;c. On all our Benefactors pour Thy daily Blessings down, But more especially on Her Who wears the British Crown. We bless, O Lord, thy Holy Name, For Wonders Thou hast wrought, And pray, with one accord, for them By whom we're Fed and Taught. Chorus. All Honour, &amp;c. A new Psalm, to be sung by a Congregation of Poets. O Lord direct us in the ways Of Truth, and keep us in the same, And grant us Numbers fit to praise Thy Works, and Thy Eternal Name: Inspire us with such heav'nly Flights, As may become the Holy Theme; Reform our Lives, refine our Wits, Thou everlasting Great Supreme. O teach us to obey Thy Laws, Those standing Rules of humane Good. And strength'n us to defend Thy Cause With Zeal, when ever 'tis withstood. Let no Regard to Life or Health, Postpone our Duty to Thy Throne; Nor suff'r us, for the sake of Wealth, To do what we should leave undone. Let not the Lust of Party-Praise, Debauch our Fancies and our Pens, To fill the World with factious Lays, That impious Knaves may gain their Ends. But give us Grace to learn and write Thy Holy Precepts in our Hearts, And make Religion our Delight, Instead of vain deceitful Arts. On Earth there is no solid Joy But flows, O God, from Thee alone; Nor can it be obtain'd, but by The Mediation of Thy Son: The sacred Doctrine He hath taught, If well observ'd, true Comfort brings; And to be Christians as we ought, Is to be Greater far than Kings. Worldly Externals raise us high, 'Tis true, in other Mens Esteem, But if into ourselves we pry, We find those Gugaws but a Dream. Why then do Princes swell with Pride, And boast aloud their Royal Blood, Since none to Heaven are ally'd, But the Meek, Faithful, and the Good? The Great forget that they must Dye, But where's their Wealth and boasted Birth, Since all e'relong must huddl'd lie In the dark Bowels of the Earth? Where Tyrants no Dominion bear, Nor humble Slaves Obedience pay, But where they both alike must fare, And, undistinguish'd, mix their Clay. Then give us Grace, instead of Wealth, Much Faith, instead of humane Pow'r, And grant us long to live in Health, Prepar'd against our dying Hour; That when our Souls forsake their Clay, They may to heavenly Mansions climb, And there enjoy Eternal Day, Unmeasur'd by the Glass of Time. Tom Tell-truth: OR, THE PLAIN-DEALER. The Church and the Faction are striving To baffle each other's Design: The Tories for J?s are contriving, The Whigs for the H?r Line. Whilst others by trimming and shamming 'Twixt both, do their Favours divide: Which shews that they only are aiming To answer the ends of their Pride. The Tories are gaping for Places, The Whigs are in hopes of the same, But both are made Bubbles and Asses, By some that I care not to name. We blame both the French and the Dutchmen, For breaking their Leagues and their Words; But sure there's no Nation of such Men, As Britain at present affords. The Feuds by our Leaders fomented Are only for Places of Trust; And when they have got what they wanted, All Parties are equally just. Tho' at odds, by a joint Approbation, They once pull'd their Sovereign down, That they better might bubble the Nation, By setting up one of their own. Revolution will cause Revolution, Till we rectify what is amiss; For remember that young Canticusian Brought the Turks to be Masters of Greece. Even so did our L?s and our C?ns Call over the Dutch to our Aid, For fear that King James and his Romans Should the Protestant Int'rest invade. But had they been equally careful Of a cursed Fanatical Crew, Of whom we've more cause to be fearful, They'd have given the Devil his due. At the Great Gates in Red-Bull-Yard, between St. John's-Street and Clerkenwel-Green There, on that ancient venerable Ground, Where Shakespear in Heroick Buskins trod, Within a Good Old Fabrick, may be found Celestial Liquors fit to charm a God. Rich Nectar, Royal Punch, and Home-brew'd Ale, Such as our Fathers drank in Times of Yore, When Beef, Fat Bacon, and salubrious Cale, Were Food and Physick for the Rich and Poor. Commodious Rooms, with Hamstead Air supply'd; Obliging Usage for each civil Guest; A Garden Spot, whose fertile Banks provide Refreshing Salads to delight the Taste. No Bacchanalian Ensigns at the Door, To give the Publick notice, are display'd, Yet Friends are welcome: We shall say no more, But hope their Friendship will promote a Trade. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Numb. V. Upon a Tory Lady who happen'd to open her Floodgates at the Tragedy of Cato. An Epigram. Whilst maudlin Whigs deplore their Cato's Fate, Still with dry Eyes the Tory Celia fate: But tho' her Pride forbad her Eyes to flow, The gushing Waters found a vent below. Tho' secret, yet with copious Streams she mourns, Like twenty River-gods with all their Urns. Let others screw a Hypocritick Face, She shows her Grief in a sincerer place! Here Nature reigns, and Passion void of Art, For this Road leads directly to the Heart. The following Epitaph, tho' old, was never before Printed. Epitaphium Jo. Drydeni, Q. P. L. Thus render'd into English. You that the Ashes of the Muses mourn, Cast a moist Eye on Dryden's sacred Urn; Bestow a Tear, Apollo bids you weep! The British Virgil does in silence sleep. Vict'ry herself forlorn, with drooping Wings, Protects his Shrine, her Poet's Praises sings, Whose bold Salonick and Pantherean Verse Embalm his Fame and consecrate his Hearse. Batavian Wreaths he scorn'd should girt his Brow: Look down! there Palms and lasting Laurels grow. Engrav'd upon a Salver made of all sorts of base Coin, according to the following Particulars. In Coin I pass'd for some Years since, Eight Pounds, One Shilling, Seven Pence, Made up of Silver, Brass, and Spelter, All mix'd together Helter Skelter: One Crown-piece, much the worse for wearing; Forty-six Half-Crowns spoil'd by paring; Thirty-three Shillings finely rounded; Four Ninepences almost confounded; Six Testers very neatly snip'd; Two Groats that could not well be clip'd; Four Fourpenoehalfpenies, two broken, The others bent like Country Token; One Threepence; Silver Penies two. From these I chang'd my Form anew. When I at first was melted down, I Ounces weigh'd full Twenty-one, And then each Ounce the Value bore Of Three and Ninepence and no more; But oft'ner melted, I at last Improv'd my Goodness, tho' with waste, That I but Eighteen Ounces weigh, And Four and Two-pence is my Say. Upon rooting up the Royal Oak in St. James's Park, rais'd from an Acorn, set by the Hand of King Charles II. who brought the same from his old hiding-place at Boscobel. An Epigram. Whilst Zarah from the Royal Ground Roots up the Royal Oak, The Sapling, groaning at the Wound, Thus to the Syren spoke, Ah! may the Omen kindly fail, For poor Britannia's Good! Or else not only me you'll fell, But her that owns the Wood. H. C. The seasonable Caution. On the foregoing Subject. Epigram II. Be cautious, Madam, how you thus provoke This sturdy Plant, the second Royal Oak; For should you fell it, or remove it hence, When dead, it may revenge the proud Offence, And build a Scaffold in another place, That may e'erlong prove fatal to Your G?; Nay, furnish out a useful Gallows too Sufficient for your Friends, tho' not for you: Then let it stand a Monument of Fame, To that forgiving Prince who set the same; For should it fall by you, the World will pray The Fate may be your own another Day. The Murmurs of the Oak. Epigram III. Why dost thou root me up! ingrateful Hand! My Father sav'd a King, who sav'd the Land: That King to whom thy Mother ow'd her Fame, When Whoring was no Crime, to Bawd no Shame. But since the Malice of her Spawn, Your G?, Presumes to rend me from my native Place, Where by the Royal Hand I first was set, And, from an Acorn, thriv'd to be thus Great, May I be hew'd (now rooted up by thee) Into some lofty famous Triple-Tree, Where none may swing but such as have betray'd Those gen'rous Pow'rs by whom themselves were made: Then may I hope to gain as much Renown, By trussing up my Foes, that cut me down, As my tall Parent, when he bravely stood The Monarch's safeguard in the trembling Wood; For as the Matter stands, now War is o'er, And restless Faction aims at Sov'reign Pow'r, I know not which would prove the best good Thing To hang up Traytors, or preserve a King. A Prayer to Apollo. O grant, Apollo, that I ne'er may come, Where dull repeating Blockheads fill the Room; Whose poor pedantick Talent chiefly lies, In puzling Fools, and carping at the Wise: Doom not my Ears to hear a Dolt rehearse The scraps of some old Tragick Poet's Verse, Who, like an unfledg'd Hero on the Stage, Huffs, puffs, and rants as if o'ercome with Rage, And, by false Cadency and dreadful Sound, Tortures the Words and does the Sense confound! Nor suffer me, thou God of Rhime, to meet That Fool of Fools, a proud conceited Wit, Who with some Learning stock'd, but ill bestow'd, Does all Men's Labours but his own explode, Yet steals from e'ery Author that he reads, And with their Scraps his hungry Genius feeds, To please some Party who commend the Tool, And cry him up, tho' insolent and dull, Till, like the Whigs fam'd Advocate, he gains Much popular Applause by others Brains. So the Quack Doctor in a Country-Town, Thrives not by Cunning he can call his own, But the arch Sayings of his agent Clown. O let me not in Coffee-House be teas'd, With partial News from foreign Letters squeez'd, Curtail'd and couch'd to please a factious Race, Who, like their Tools, are infamous and base, Both hating Truth as noxious to their Ends, Encourage Lyes, on which their Cause depends, And scandalize their Rivals, to oblige their Friends! Let not my Ears be baited with the Praise Of S????? D????? who struggles for the Bays, Yet at large Int'rest, and sometimes a Treat, When native Dulness reigns, in spight of Wit, Borrows fresh Succour of each abler Friend, And wins the Town's Applause by what they lend. So Madam Baugtail with a Face of Brass, Rig'd by some Bawd, does for a Beauty pass; Talks of high Birth, and flutters thro' the Town, In borrow'd Plumes, each Cully thinks her own; Wins, by her Dress, a new admiring Crew, Till she believes herself the Lord knows who; But stripp'd of Friends, her Beauty quickly dies, And she who made such Conquests with her Eyes, Turns common Strum for want of fresh Supplies. Thus fares our Author, who is seldom bright, But when his trusty Friends vouchsafe to write, And when they fail, his Laurels bid good Night. All Sublunary Things are subject to Mutation. A Poem. Great were our Hero's Actions, Great the House Rais'd to his Fame, but neither finish'd are; The Pile, a Mountain seems; the Man, a Mouse; And yet the Monster does in both appear. His Blenheim Laurels wither on his Brow, Whilst Blenheim Weeds at Woodstock thrive apace; Which will hereafter shew, as well as now, Both the Foundations of their Greatness base. 'Tis true, had Faction prosper'd, as she hop'd, The wondrous Babel might e'erlong have made King John a Palace, but his Pride was stop'd, When Anna would no longer be betray'd. In him the change of sublunary Things, To caution humane Race, are justly seen, For he that was to conquer many Kings, Is now the scorn of an offended Queen. Let no Man, tho' successful, wrong his Trust, Or trespass on the Favours of a Crown; For if he does, it is no more than just, The Pow'r that set him up should pull him down. A silly Wife the worst of Evils. An Ode. Of all the plagues of humane Life, A foolish Woman is the worst; For tho' she's honest, if your Wife, You'll surely find your self accurs'd. The Reason's plain, because a Fool, Tho' chast, will act as if a Wh???re, And aim imperiously to rule, Altho' she knows no use of Pow'r: When she who is by nature blest With Sense and Manners, tho' a Jilt, Will make you easy in your Breast, And from Suspicion skreen her Guilt. Then grant, ye Gods, whene'er I wed, A cautious Wife my Fate may be; Who, if she stains her marriage Bed, Will free my Thoughts from Jealousie. The odious Comparison. An Epigram. A whig, a Nettle, and a Toad, Are much alike, by all that's Good: The Nettle stings, the Whig he bites, The swelling Toad his Venom spits: But crush 'em all, your Strength exert, And neither then can do you hurt. The deceitfulness of human Friendship: OR, Providence the best Friend to the Unfortunate. An Ode. The wretched Mortal who hath Sense To put his Trust in Providence, May hope to be reliev'd; But he who foolishly depends On old Acquaintance, call'd, his Friends, Will surely be deceiv'd. For mutual Int'rest is the tye, That makes vain Man on Man rely; And he that once is low, If he attempts to rise, will find, 'Tis in the Nature of Mankind, To always keep him so. Men love to see another toss'd, By Fate, from Pillar unto Post, Till mis'rably undone; That when reduc'd to starving Shame, They may aloud his Conduct blame, And magnify their own. I thought, long since, (cries every Base Censorious Slut, and Purse-proud Ass) What all his huffing Pride Would come to, for his Neighbours say, He rather chose to Spend than Pay, Or else he was bely'd. Such Calumnies as these, and worse, The sordid World will cast, in course, Upon the Wretch decay'd; And, tho' he's honest, if he starves, They'll all agree, that he deserves To want his daily Bread. But Crowds of Flatt'rers, if you're Rich, Will wait like Lacquies at your Breech, All hoping for a Boon: But if you once mistake your way, And backward fall into Decay, You'll find your Levy flown. Nay, even those you have preferr'd, And kept, perhaps, at Bed and Board, Will to the World pretend, (Instead of owning Favours done, Which helpt, perhaps, your Ruin on) That each have been your Friend. Ever since Adam first Rebel'd, Ingratitude has been intail'd On all his vicious Race; No Man can boast a God-like Mind, From that Infernal Dross refin'd; By Nature all are Base. The only real Diff'rence is, There are Degrees in Villanies; But still the very best Of Men, if he'd but look at home, Would be convinc'd, he is by some Sly little Devil possest. Only the bigger Knave than he, Like greater Monsters in the Sea, Will prey on him that's less; And those more honest than himself, He'll over-reach, for sake of Pelf, And thus his Wrongs redress. From Tyrants down to petty Knaves, All have their Bubbles, Fools and Slaves; 'Tis by Experience found: For one Degree another rides, And that, the next Degree bestrides, And thus the World goes round. The Mournival of Knaves. An Epigram. Four arrant Knaves, in one deceitful Pack, Together hang, and hold each other's Back. How! Hang together, did I chance to say! O that we could but see that happy Day! 'Tis true they'r cancell'd, and no more Court-Cards, But still some think they want their Just Rewards. Proud Hewson, Pam, no more shall save his Looe, Or Knave of Hearts Theatrick Punks subdue: The Knave of Spaids shall do no further hurt, Or with a Tongue invenom'd shame the Court: Nor shall the Knave of Diamonds, now h'as lost The Game, win Beauty at the Publick cost; But since they've all betray'd their want of Brains, Instead of Knaves, shall pass for Single Tens. A Bottle-Definition of that Fall'n Angel, call'd, a WHIG. What is a Whig? a cunning R??gue, That once was in, now out of vogue: A Rebel to the Church and Throne, Of Lucifer the very Spawn: A Tyrant, who is ne'er at rest In Power, or when he's Disposess'd: A Knave, who foolishly has lost, What so much Blood and Treasure cost: A Lying, Bouncing Desperado, A Bomb, a Stink-pot, a Granado; That's ready Prim'd, and Charg'd, to Break, And Mischief do for Mischief's sake: A Comet, whose portending Phiz Appears more dreadful than it is, But now propitious Stars repel Those Ills it fasly did fortel, 'Twill burst with unregarded Spight, And, since the Parliament proves right, Will turn to Smoke, which shone of late So bright and flaming in the State. The Modish Quack: OR Doctor Merryman's Panacea against all Melancholy Distempers. [I] Come all ye Ladies, who have lost Your Lovers, by your Folly; And Maids, in your Affections cross'd, Depress'd with Melancholy; Unmarry'd Dames, with Bellies Great, Fatigu'd to find a Father; And Dowdies forc'd, in spight of Fate, To keep your Legs together; Ye Sighing old Fools, And ye Cuckoldly Tools, Who lament at your hornify'd Fortune, Whilst your Wives are hugg'd close, By young Spindle-shank'd Beaus, In your Absence, behind the Curtain. Chorus. Be as sad and as mad as you please, Your Spirits, tho' cloudy, I'll clear up, And infallibly give you all Ease, With my Pills and a Glass of my Chear up. II Come all ye modern Saints, that wear Religion in your Faces, And you that shew your sad Despair, In dull austere Grimaces. You Breaking Merchants, who repine, For want of Coin and Credit, And grieve that Trade should so decline, When you so greatly need it: Ye Beaus and ye Bells, Who subsist by your Tails, And ye diving Night-walkers and Bunters, Who are stroling to Day, Very Frolick and Gay, And to Morrow, in Workhouse or Counters. Chorus. Be as sad, &amp;c. III Come all of High or Low Degree, That would be brisk and merry, Tho' ne'er so sad, be rul'd by me, I've Physick that will Chear ye: My Golden Pills, so highly fam'd, Throughout our British Nation, So greatly priz'd, so richly nam'd, For pow'rful Operation: Take a Dose, and I'm sure, You'll not fail of a Cure; Be you never so dull they'll divert ye; Tho' as pale in your Looks, As a Punk in a Flux, They will carry off all that can hurt ye. Chorus. Be as sad, &amp;c. IV Let Whig or Tory come to me, I'll cure 'em of the Simples; And toaping Barren Ladies, free From Vapours or from Pimples: The wry-neck'd Zealot I can bring, As strait as any Arrow, And cause the humming Drone to sing, And cherup like a Sparrow: I've a Cordial beside, For the Saint or his Bride, Far exceeding the old Diapente, That will raise a cross Witch To an amorous Pitch, And recover Old Age to be Twenty. Chorus. Be as sad, &amp;c. V Contending Parties I can bind, In friendship Everlasting; And make a scolding Whore prove kind, And honest, without Basting. Nay, all Distempers in the State, Or Madness in the Nation, I cure with Ease, in spight of Fate, Without the least Taxation; Whether owing to such As adhere to the Dutch, Or to those of the Chevalier's Party; If they'll take my Advice, They shall all, in a trice, To the National Int'rest be hearty. Chorus. Be as sad, &amp;c. Woman given to Change: OR, The wonderful Difference between a Maid and a Wife. I When I was Young, and dear Belinda Fair, Each charming glance of her engaging Eyes, So warm'd my Veins, that 'twas my hourly Care, To Court the Nymph, that I might win the Prize: So am'rous she appear'd, so vig'rous I, That both alike seem'd eager of the Joy. II But when, with moving Sighs, and humble Vows, I had obtain'd the Nymph to my Embrace, Her Tongue confirm'd her a vexatious Blowze; And chang'd her Looks into a Fury's Face; Now all her Maiden Smiles were turn'd to Frowns, No Peace without new Peticoats and Gowns. III The Heav'n I hop'd for, thus I sought in vain, Enjoyment prov'd but a deceitful Toy, To which the Nymph allures the silly Swain, By only study'd Looks, and seeming Coy; But when she' as noos'd him in the Nuptial State, He's Woman's Bubble, which he finds too late. A SATYR By one Lady upon another. This leisure Hour, Great Mother P????is thine, That in my Verse thy wondrous Fame may shine; Tho', shou'd each spiteful Muse attend my call, Or had I Dorset's Wit, or Dryden's Gall, Still shou'd I want what's needful, to pursue The Vice you practice, and the Ills you do: So hard it is to Paint a Monster true. Thou worst of all thy Undeserving Kind, By Nature's Malice, for our Curse design'd; Shame of thy Race, and Torment of our Sex, Whom thou delight'st to Wrong, and seek'st to Vex: Vain as the Empty Sorceress, that dwells In some dark Alley, where she Fortunes tells; With the same Wiles that such Impostors use, Thou dost the list'ning cred'lous Fop abuse; Witness thy kind Predictions, which relate To that fam'd Bard, by borrow'd Wit made Great; Wherein, like Moorfields Wizard, you foresee, By Pow'rs which reign'd at his Nativity, That as he now appears a Blazing Star, An Enemy to Peace, a Friend to War, So e're old Time one Annual Course had run, He surely shou'd become a Shining Sun; When, spight of all thy Arts, the World must see, He's grown, of late, as scandalous as thee; And, being deaf to Reason's friendly Voice, Is wretched by his own Ill-natur'd Choice. Which shews thy Calculations of the Man, Are full as false, as he himself is vain: Therefore, wise Madam, pray no more pretend, By Moorfields Banter, to deceive your Friend: The thriving Trade of Secret Love pursue, And quit not your old Calling for a new; But make that Stair-case where you now remain, As famous as your House in Chanc'ry-Lane; Which useful, lustful, much frequented Box, Stood Neighbour to the Whipping-Post and Stocks. But as the Man, who Places his Abode Most near the Church, is farthest still from God, So you from Punishment liv'd most secure, When Justice stood Erect before your Door; Therefore return to th'Place from whence you came, The Beaus will follow soon to cool their Flame; What Lust or Int'rest carried you to them? But thou wert always Fickle, False, and Base, Fond of new Lovers, fearless of Disgrace; Unfix'd in Principles, oppress'd with Fears, No Good enjoys, and all that's Evil bears. 'Tis Lust, no Soul that animates thy Clay, Tho' soft without, within thou'rt all Decay; Burnt up by unextinguishable Fires, And Means employ'd to cool thy hot Desires; Ill fares the Wretch, who by thy fading Charms, Is tempted to thy loose insatiate Arms, For as the Syren, thou hast learn'd to Wooe, And fancy'st e'ery Object that is new, Thus liv'st to Love, and Lov'st but to Undo. An Epitaph upon a Bawdy Batchelor, who lately Departed this Life. Here Jack lies dead, but let no Mortal grieve, Since as he liv'd to Die, he dy'd to Live. To Nuptial Joys, he was, alas, unknown, Yet lov'd his Neighbour's Wife, as if his own. Marriage he scoff'd, liv'd single till he dy'd, Then rival'd Death, and made the Grave his Bride. Hard Fate! for sure no Mortal ever chose A more Voracious, or Insatiate 'Spouse! Yet hug'd within her cold Embrace he lies, O'ercome with Sleep, till Angels bid him Rise. Thus, free from Cares, he lodges unoppress'd, And, undisturb'd, in Silence takes his Rest. A Peaceful Blessing few good Women give, To those fond Fools that Marry whilst they live. Upon GAMING. An Epigram. 'Tis strange, the Man who has enough in store, Should hazard what's his own, in hopes of more, Since, if he wins, he only does possess, More than he really wanted, when he'ad less; But if Ill Fortune his Desires should cross, The starving Wretch, too late, may mourn his Loss. Then be content, when ye sufficient have, Who covets more is but a greedy Knave, And, to imprison'd Bags, a Turnkey and a Slave. Upon LOVE. An Epigram. Why do we doat on charming Chloe's Face, And pine and languish for her soft Embrace? Since, when she's granted what we're fond to take, We slight her Favours, and the Nymph forsake. Then let's not love, unless we can be kind, And still content with the Remains we find; Else we are Fools to covet such a Prize, Which, when obtain'd, we lessen and despise. An Epigram written by a Quaker, to a trousom Impertinent, who us'd to tease him about his Religion. If thou lov'st Peace, why then dost thou torment The Peace of us, that slumber in Content? Thou sayst, we err, pray what is that to thee? Thou'rt not to answer for my Friends or me. If thou to Heav'n hast found a nearer cut, Go thou that way, we're free to go about; We grutch no Labour, thou may'st be in haste, It is enough we find out Heav'n at last. Let not thy Evil Tongue my Spirit move, Take off the Creature, learn to live in Love, And that's the way for both to meet above. Between the Genius of Billingsgate, and the Genius of Exchange-Alley. A Dialogue. Genius of Billingsgate. Be gone, thou tricking Genius, hence, To Exchange-Alley fly with haste; Where busy Knaves contend for Pence, And laugh at Conscience as a Jest. Genius of Exchange-Alley. Be silent, thou provoking Hag, I know thy Hatchet-Face of old, Thou'rt Billingsgate's Eternal Plague, That prompts the Thumbring'd Wives to scold. Genius of Billingsgate. What's that to thee? do thou be gone, Among the crafty jobbing Crew, Who oft sell Stock, when they have none, And, with the Christian, blend the Jew. Genius of Exchange-Alley. Tis true, but how can you upbraid A Practice so approv'd of late; Since Lies, ill Words, and Oaths are made, Your common Mart at Billingsgate. Genius of Billingsgate. Foul Language hath been always claim'd, By noisy Fishwives, as their Right; They're proud to think their Tongues are fam'd, And scold by Custom, not in Spight. Genius of Exchange-Alley. So Cunning in Perfection reigns, In that fam'd Alley I frequent, Where Brokers, Jobbers, Jews and Saints, Each Day new tricking Arts invent. Genius of Billingsgate. Why then shou'd Scolding be a Vice? Or false Reproach so odious be? Since all Men have their useful Lies, And e'ery Trade its Mystery. The Lawyer cozens in his Fees, The Citizen extorts in Price: In short, the Knave in all Degrees, Reigns like the Devil in the Dice. Genius of Exchange-Alley. Why then am I in fault to teach My Jobbers to be like the rest? Since he that's hasty to be Rich, Must deal with a deceitful Breast. Then prithee, Sister, be my Friend, For us to quarrel's but a Folly, Do you the Fisher-Drabs attend, And I the Knaves in Exchange-Alley. Truth without Dissembling: OR, A Merry Ballad on the Times. Since Gold is the God of the Nation, Which every Side does adore, There is no other Quarrel in Fashion, But what's for the Purse and the Pow'r. Whoever at Court is discarded, Will never sit easily down, But thinks he's too little rewarded, Perhaps, for betraying the Crown. Why blame we the D?e and the D?ss, For aiming to make all their own, Since M?hy halts upon C?s, And the C?h is as lame as the T?e? But now, God be thank'd, there's no Danger, New Oliver Plots but in vain; And, as well as his Petticoat-Ranger, Is banish'd the Presence of Ann. Or else a Usurping Protector, Perhaps, might have govern'd the State, But Britain, Good Heav'n direct her, Tho' foolish, is wiser than that. Yet, alas, should our present Translator, Who such Mighty Wonders hath done, Prove a Whig at the last, 'tis no matter Whether govern'd by R? or J?, For since we are still but the Bubbles Of every Party that Rules, We shall ne'er have an end of our Troubles, Till rid of our Knaves and our Fools. Of which we have no Expectation, Till some for their Insolence pay, And the foolish degenerate Nation Learns Wisdom enough to Obey. If this does not speedily happen, That the Whigs may be kept in some awe, We at last must determine by Weapon, What we now might decide by the Law.
