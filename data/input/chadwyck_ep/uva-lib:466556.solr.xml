      <field name="fulltext">THE LAST DAYS OF HERCULANEUM; AND ABRADATES AND PANTHEA: POEMS THE LAST DAYS OF HERCULANEUM. It was a day of gloom, and strange suspense, And feverish, and inexplicable dread, In Herculaneum's walls. The heavy, thick, And torrid atmosphere; the solid, vast, And strong-edg'd clouds, that through the firmament In various and opposing courses moved:â The wild scream of the solitary bird That, at long intervals, flew terror-driven On high:âthe howling of the red-ey'd dog As he gaz'd trembling on the angry heavens:â The hollow moans that swept along the air, Though every wind was lock'd,âportended all That nature with some dire event was big, And labour'd in its birth. The artist's shop Was closed:âthe hammer of the brawny smith Lay on the anvil:âin the silent streets The hoof of steed was heard not:â'neath its shed The whirling car slept on its noiseless wheels. 'Twas silence all, and apprehension dark And terrible. Who walk'd abroad might hear From the closed house at times the infant's scream:â The voice suppress'd of boding fear, like his Who struggles in an agonizing dream:â Anon the deep and solemn tones of prayer:â And then the mingled hum of many tongues In earnest talk, yet soften'd down as though They told of murders. From a slow ope'd door A pale and shrinking figure came at times, With wild and gleaming eye a moment turn'd Up to the pitchy firmament:âthen back In haste withdrew, and, with such gentle hand As his who fears to wake an enemy, The portal clos'd again. As day advanced Sulphureous fumes pervaded all the air: Far distant sounds, scarce audible, came on As of the bursting of a mighty flame;â And deep beneath the ground some said they heard A noise like that of many pond'rous cars In fierce career;âor like the boom and rush Of floods contending.â Here and there a group With fear-mark'd faces stood,âwho all aghast Gazed on the awful sky, and whispering told Their terrors;âfor 'twas said a pine-tree huge Had been beheld on high Vesuvius' top That branch'd into the heavens:âand some had seen Grim spectres giant-sized, that to and fro Glided upon the mountain's summit dim, Or walk'd unsinking on the obscure air. Some on the dusky ocean had descried Strange shadowy shapes; and some had heard the waves Loud dashing in mid-sea,âthough not a breeze Fann'd their hot brows.âSome in the terrible sky Had imaged forth appalling forms;âa god They saw, huge as an Alpine hill, who rode Half hidden on a throne of clouds, and breathed Red vapours from his nostrils:âand his eyes Glared like two suns of blood through mist. One saw, Down bending from the sky distinct, a face Horrific;âblack as tenfold night;âsevere, But calm it look'd with steadfast gaze to earth, And eyes that never closed, though all around A thousand fires unintermitting play'd. Terror was over all men:âwhat to fear They scarcely knew:âyet to the stoutest heart The panic shudderings crept; and in the brain Of wisest man work'd dire imaginings And shapeless horrors. Night was closing in With heavy shades ere yet the sun went down;â When, lo! the earth was shaken to its base; And the loud roaring, smother'd and profound, Of subterranean thunders fill'd the air. Down from the roofs the rattling ruins fell:â The strong foundations shook:âthe mighty domes Heav'd to and fro:âthe lofty columns rock'd. Then swell'd the shrieks of terror:âin the streets Rush'd suddenly, as though the graves had given Their ghastly tenants forth, thick multitudes Of yelling wretches, pale and horror struck:â A livid light seem'd streaming from their eyes: Some cower'd, and shrunk, and fell upon the earth: Some shouted as in rage;âand some with tears Big rolling down their marble cheeks, stood stiff And paralyzed. All shapes that horror stamps On man in face or gesture might be seen. Here one, to madness work'd, his hard clench'd hands Threw out tow'rds heaven,âwith flashing, rolling eyes Brow harshly furrow'd;âbared and gnashing teeth, And nostril spread, as though in maniac rage To threat the Thunderer. Upon their knees, With upward pointed hands, these pray'd aloud; And those, as if intoxicated, reel'd And stumbled on. Some struck their dearest friends, But grasp'd their enemy close:âsome wail'd aloud; Beat on their breastsâand tore their hair away,â And wrung their hands; then wept and wail'd again. Convulsed with ceaseless laughter, others fell Backward upon the ground;âand some there were, By terror as by lightning kill'd, stretch'd out Upon the earth: while by the tottering walls Supported, others sat, stiffen'd and dead, With jaw depress'd, and ghastly open eye, Upon the startled gazer glaring grim. The earth again was still:âthe thunders died:â The sounds of lamentation and of fear Subsided slowly to a gloomy hush. Each where he stood remain'd:âthe mother hugg'd Her infant to her breast:âthe father grasp'd The trembling hand of his beloved child:â Fast in the lover's arm the shrinking maid Was folded. Dreadful expectation hung, And silence over all. A thousand eyes Were anxious fix'd upon the lowering sky, Whose massive, rocky, and red margin'd clouds, Rank piled o'er rank, had ceased their wandering course, And over that devoted city now, Like armies concentrating for attack, Were settling slow. Within a spacious square A little group there was, who on their knees And with declined heads sent prayers to heaven.â To those at distance placed,âeven through the dense, Dim atmosphere, distinctly visible Were they;âfor round them shone a pallid flame; And from their heads it pointed to the sky:â Right over them from a dark cloud there came A point of misty light; as when the sun Shoots through the watery clouds a slanting ray Obscure: they who look'd on it heard, they said, Or thought they heard, a hissing as of snakes, Or like the sound that through the withering leaves Autumnal, wake the breezes as they pass. Not long they look'd,âfor thro' the thick, dark air Glanced the red thunder-bolt with light intense That smote who saw with blindness. Earth and heaven Rock'd with the bursting thunders:âto their base Shook the strong temples, and the lofty towers. On that devoted group the bolt had fallen:â And when, recovering sense, the people turn'd To look again upon them, they beheld No sign of man,âbut on the earth there lay A heap of whiten'd ashes. Sunk again The thunder's roar:âand gloomy silence came Once more upon them. Trembling, to their homes The citizens return'd. Darkness intense Soon cover'd all things;âand the close, hot air, Felt suffocating. Some who linger'd still, Or ere retiring to their sleepless beds, Look'd out into the night, saw on the sky, Tow'rds where Vesuvius rear'd his giant head, A crimson tinge:âand in the stilly air The deep and soften'd thunder-mutterings heard. A night of gloom and horrors!âNot a breath Of air was felt:âthe thick hot atmosphere Came on their parching lips, as from the mouth Of opening furnace. Darkness like a pall Of deepest shade hung o'er:âno heaven, no earth, No faintest outline of the temple's form Against the sky: the uplifted hand was viewless:â Scarce could the clogg'd and heavy air transmit The labouring sound: scarce could the torch's flare Pierce through the gloom; and he who by its red And dusky light then wander'd through the streets, Lonely and sad, saw not the earth he press'd. Oh! for the tempest now! the clattering hail! Whirlwinds! tornadoes! deluge-bringing rain! Aught but this heavy-pressing firmamentâ This thick and torrid airâthis tomblike night! Who sleeps within the city?âHe, the sire, Who, labouring hard for breath,âwith burning brow, And tense and blood-shot eye,âyet fans the cheek Of his convulsed and gasping child? Sleeps she, The wretched mother, who the fiery skin Of her delirious infant laves;âthe lips That can no longer drain the dried-up breast, Wets with the water from the once cool well, Itself now scarce less burning? Sleeps the youth, The new-made bridegroom, by the virgin bride Outstretch'd,âwho prays, though with unmoving lips, For aid in their last hour of agony? Reposes she, the lovely youthful maid Before whom lies, in his last pangs convulsed, The aged sickly parent? His pale cheek Has ta'en a purple flushâhis eye is wildâ His wither'd hands he tosses to and froâ Wheezes and snorts for breathâand seems to catch At shadows. âWater,â then he feebly cries;â She puts it to his lipsâshe bathes his browâ She sprinkles o'er his venerable face:â âHotâhotââ he murmursââno, 'tis burning hotââ âOh! waterâcoldâcold water.â Muttering thus, His eye-balls fixâhe stiffensâgaspsâand dies. Who sleeps within the city? Soundly they Sleep who shall wake no more. He on whom fell The crushing ruin:âwho by the red bolt Perish'd:âthe fear-slain wretch who where he died Still sits erectâand coldâand stiff: with eye Staring and fix'dâlooking upon the nightâ The dead sleep in the city. Heavily Drag on the hours: a year of common life Less slow than such a night.âWhat is it waves At intervals along the inky sky Like a dark blood-red flag? It casts no light By which to see;âyet 'tis not for the time That depth intense of blackness,âbut a dim And dusky red obscurity:âsuch tinge As sometimes on the low and heavy clouds Of midnight by th' horizon trembling hangs Scarce seenâfrom some far distant watch-fire thrown. 'Tis the vast flame that through the sea of smoke From high Vesuvius' black and sulphurous mouth Bursts for an instant forth,âthen sinks again, In that dense vapour quench'd.âThey who behold, Marvel and fearâyet know not whence it is. Whence come those distant thunder-breathings deep, That fall with gentlest touch upon the ear, Yet seem to fill the heavensâand reach earth's centre? 'Tis from that mountain's vast and hollow womb, Now first conceiving subterranean fire, And belching earthly thunders.âThousands hear That warning voiceâyet none its meaning know.â What is it moves with gentle heave the ground; Like softest swell of ocean in a calmâ Now restsâthen comes again with tremblings soft, As from the rumbling of a loaded wainâ Felt, tho' not heard?âAll know the earthquake's tread, And would, but cannot, flee.â How drear the night! Oh! when will morning come?âthe tapers all That measure out the hours are long since spent But yet there is no day.âIs the great sun Consumed too,âor darken'd?âthis the time, So oft foretold, when nature shall expire,â The heavens be blotted outâand earth in flames Shall pass away? Such thoughts o'er many came As, slowly yielding now, the pall of night Changed to a dingy red:âlike a vast arch Of iron look'd the heavens when first the heat, Deep penetrating, to a lurid tinge Begins to turn its blackness:âredder nowâ And redder still the awful concave glowsâ Till in its bloody, but uncertain glare, The bolder may walk forth.âMan meets with man, And starts as at a fiend:âfor from the hot And fiery sky all things have caught their hue:â No sweet varieties of colour here As in the blessed sunshine:âno soft tints Like those of sweet May-morn,âwhen day's bright god Looks smiling from behind delicious mists; Throwing his slant rays on the glistening grass, Where, 'gainst the rich deep green, the cowslip hangs His elegant bells of purest gold:âthe pale, Sweet perfumed primrose lifts its face to heaven Like the full, artless gaze of infancy:â The little ray-crown'd daisy peeps beneath When the tall neighbour grass, heavy with dew, Bows down its head beneath the fresh'ning breeze;â Where oft in long dark lines the waving trees Throw their soft shadows on the sunny fields:â Where in the music-breathing hedge, the thorn And pearly white May blossom full of sweets, Hang out the virgin flag of spring, entwined With dripping honeysuckles whose sweet breath Sinks to the heartârecalling with a sigh Dim recollected feelings of the days Of youth and early love.âOh! none of these, Nature's too oft unprized treasures, bless'd That scene of woe. The pure white marble shaft That bears aloft the princely portico Of the proud palace:âthe black dungeon gate:â The pallid statue o'er some honour'd tomb That ever drooping hangs;âand the bronze Mars That bares his blood-stain'd sword:âthe solemn tree That o'er the sepulchre his dark green boughs Hangs melancholy;âand the vivid flower That in its course still looks upon the sun:â The deep brown earth, and the fresh garden tints Of emerald, with flowers of every stain The rainbow's dye can give;âthe beggar's rags, And the cerulean blue of beauty's robe;â All in one undistinguishable hue Are clad, of lurid redness. In the streets Thousands of fire-tinged figures roam amazed And fearful. âIs this morn?â they ask, âOh! what a night we've pass'd!âbut is this morn? âAnd what is that, high in the gory clouds, âThat orb of brighter crimson?â On it gaze Unnumber'd wide and wistful eyes.âBy heavens! It is the sun in his meridian fields! Where hath his morning splendour slept unseen? âIn that dense sea above of vapour, fire, Darkness, and stormsâhis morning splendour slept, And soon again he'll sink. Devoted race! Your last bright sun has set:âgaze while ye may Even on that dark red orb:âfast close around Th' impenetrable clouds:âsulphureous fogs Roll on:âlight feathery ashes mix, and fill Th' unwholesome air: the firmament grows dark, The sun's red disk seems melting in the clouds. Lookâmiserable mortals!âlook your last: A faint dim outline only can ye trace: What see ye now?ârests he behind a cloud?â No! no!âye gaze in vain!âhis beam is quench'd!â To you for ever quench'd! High in the heavens He rides sublime in his immortal course, And shall for ever roll; but to your eyes His beams return no more. Far different lights Must gild your few remaining hours:âthe flash Of the death-dealing lightningâthe red glare Of populous streets in flamesâthe sparkles dread Of moony meteorsâand an atmosphere With burning cinders fill'dâand rocks of fire. Fast came again the shades of utter dark: So suddenly they came, that those abroad Scarce found their doors. Dismay sunk deep in allâ Direful forebodingsâshapeless horrors rack Their frenzied souls. Shrieksâcursesâprayers and groansâ Deep whispering talkâand maniac mutteringsâ Are heard along the air.â 'Twas noonâyet night: In thicker showers the flaky ashes fell: Louder and deeper swell'd the thunder's voice: With stronger throes the labouring earthquake heaved; Hotter and hotter grew the breathless air. âIs there no help?â the panting wretches cried:â âOh God! is there no help?âin mercy end âOur sufferings, or our lives:âbid the floods drownâ âThe lightnings strikeâthe tumbling ruins crushâ âThe earthquake swallow, and at once destroy us:â âBid any sudden plague, if such thy will, âO'erwhelm usâany thing but this slow deathâ âThese lingering and invisible firesâthat glow âOn earthâin airâaboveâbeneathâaroundâ âThat parch us to the bones,âyet leave us life, âAnd sense of pain, and apprehension strong âOf ills to come. Is there no help? Oh! God!â Such prayers from thousands came, though power of speech Perchance denied, yet in the burning brain Conceivedâand in the glaring anguish'd eye, And by the trembling of the shrivell'd lip, To Heaven interpreted. What thought can reach, What language can express, the agoniesâ The horrors of that hour! An earth beneath That threaten'd to devourâan atmosphere That burn'd and chokedâashes that fell for rainâ Thunders that roar'd aboveâthunders that groan'd And heaved belowâand solid darkness round, That like an ocean of black waters whelm'd And press'd upon the earth!â Lives there a man, Who, in some death-like trance, to the dark tomb Consign'd, has there awoke; smelt the foul stench Of the dank vault; felt on his straiten'd limbs The grave's habiliments; then, in despair And terror strong, has burst his narrow house, And known the shadows of the seal'd-up tomb? Such man alone may image well this deep, Unutterable darkness.âLives there one. Who, in some prison cell chain'd down, has heard The flames loud crackling, roaring underneath; Felt to his shrinking foot the floor grow hot; Breathed the thick, stifling air, while thro' each chink The quenchless fire has rush'd, till his heart seem'd To burst, his brain to burn? such wretch alone May faintly know the oppressive misery Of that dire atmosphere. So pass'd the time;â Still fell the ashy showers;âstill rock'd the earth:â Still with increasing rage Vesuvius spoke In thunders;âstill a pitchy darkness hung Impenetrable o'er them. Hundreds then Had perish'd; thousands gasp'd 'twixt life and death; All wanted aid,âbut there was none to help. 'Twas now the middle hour 'tween noon and eve:â What is it meets the wistful, open'd ear, At the short thunder-pauses,âheavily Dropping, wide scatter'd on the ashy bed That strews the streets?âthicker and faster now It falls;âit trickles from the eaves;âit poursâ It rolls in torrents now:ââOh God!â they cry, â'Tis rain!â'tis blessed rain!â Wide fly the doorsâ The windows open fly:âcrowds fill the streets Though dark as chaos:âfaces, hands are raised Greedy to catch the treasure ere it falls. But what a rain is this!âOh! not like showers Of spring delicious;âwhen the gladsome earth Breathes fragrance all around;âwhen the flowers droop Their freshen'd, glistening heads;âthe bright green grass Waves twinkling to the breeze;âthe birds strike up Their joyous symphonies;âthe heifer lows;â The lambkin gambols blithe;âthe trout upsprings From the clear brook;âand man forgets his cares, And walks abroad to breathe the perfumed air, And warm him in the sun:âOh! not like showers Of glorious spring is this!â'tis a hot floodâ A gush of steaming rain!âbut yet 'tis moist, And fresh'ning to their parch'd and cracking skin;â And there they stand, and drink at every pore The softening fluid. Every age, and rank, And sex, is there,âin darkness and in storm, From which, in happier hour, the hardiest frame Would have shrunk back; yet feel they for the time A pause from misery. But through the streets The deep'ning torrent flowsâlike o'ercharg'd brook Hoarse-murmuringârushing. Heavier falls the rainâ In floods it falls:âalready to the knees The children stand immersed:âtheir cries of fear Are heard:âthe clouds still burst above:âno more In drops, but solid sheets, the rain descends: The deluge roars and rushes on:âterror O'er-masters all:âfain would they seek their homes, But who shall guide their steps?âthe blinding gloom Mocks their attempts; the dashing of the flood, The thunder's roll, the shrieks of those who call For aid that none can give; confusion strange 'Tis allâdismay unspeakable. Even now Some in the blacken'd torrent are borne down, And their shrill drowning cries are heard: that fate Had been the doom of multitudesâbut lo! On the Tartarean darkness,âsuddenly Burst the wide sheeted lightning;âon the face Of the black, troubled waters glanced and heavedâ Gleam'd on the shining roofsâthe temple domes Wash'd o'er with silvery lightâand on the high And marble columns show'd the clear, calm brows Of sculptured heroes, who like Gods serene Look'd-on amid convulsions, storms, and death.â Flash follow'd flash;âunceasing thunders roll'd And shouted through the arch of Heaven:âat once O'er all the sky unnumber'd lightnings play'd;â Unnumber'd thunders bellow'd and career'd:â The lofty pillars were shiver'dâand fell to earthâ The temples firedâhouses were split in twainâ And in the turbid rain-streams, thick upmix'd With ashes hot, the bright blue thunderbolts Fell hissing.â Where are now the hapless crowds That lately fill'd the streets?âLook on the earth;â There blacken'd corses lie by lightning singed:â There, tumbling down the stream, a hideous head Nods in its course:âthere, underneath yon pile Of levell'd walls, some mangled limb alone Looks out in gore bedrench'd from the crush'd trunk Hot welling:âand see there a head forth peeps:â Thoughtful and calm it seems, though somewhat pale, And lightly dash'd with blood:âyou'd say it lived, And matters deep was pondering,âso the eye, Open and earnest, seems emitting thought;â The knitted forehead to the working brain So correspondent seems; but that, flat press'd Beneath yon mountain load,âwhat once was limbs,â Heartâlungsâfleshânerves and boneâto form a man, Now lies a crimson jellyâoozing slow, And bubbling from beneath.â Their houses, most, Though to the lowest stone the buildings rock, And groan and creak the beams,âyet safer hold Than those dire lightningsâand that burning shower Unshelter'd to oppose.âIn cellars dark,â Far underground and gloomy, others sit And list the deaden'd uproar of the storm High over them, and underneath they hear Thunders deep buried. But along the shore Stand some and look aghast upon the deep:â There is no wind in heavenâand yet the waves Seem striving with a tempest: pond'rously They swell aloftâand shake their foamy heads:â Now sink in hollows;ânow together dash, And spit the whizzing spray on high:âthis way, One instant rollâthen backward;ânot like seas Still bowing to the impulse of the wind With onward rise and fall,âbut to and fro Tossing and reeling,âas the Almighty hand Had smitten underneath their rocky bed And made the abysses tremble and leap up.â Heavily rock the anchor'd barks:âtheir masts Dash on alternate sides the brine:âthe prow Now seems to bore into the gulph,ânow mounts, And the broad stern descends:âand over all Ten thousand lightnings shake their blazing brands; Making the waves seem flame;âand with the clash And hiss of charging billows joins the roar Of never dying thunders.â It was now The hour of midnight:âwith unyielding force The storm continued, though long time the rain Had ceased to plough the earth:âbut now came on A hot and sulphurous wind:âand on it borne Thickâblackârevolvingâmountain heaps of smoke, With heavier fall of ashes mix'd, that brought A momentary darkness: and anon Came coals of fire, wide scatter'd through the air, And on the moist ground steaming as they fell. The wind blows strong:âswiftly the black smoke rolls And tumbles onward:âin its depths is night;â But all around incessant lightnings glance, Tinging its heavy masses with bright skirts Of vivid red,âand through its pitchy clouds Breaking in forked lines of fire, as though Darkness with light held strife for mastery.â The firmament might seem another earth With mountains huge of brassâand darting streams Between, of liquid silver;âsuch a bulk And hue the piled up clouds,âand shone so bright Their margins with the lightning's ceaseless flow,â Did they not roll, as earth does not,âand take Each instant new and uncouth forms, scouring With furious haste along, like demon shapes On hell's unholy errands bound. But see! The tempest thickens:âlouder howls the blast:â The burning cinders fall like hailstones down; Darker and faster rolls the flood of smoke:â And sailing 'thwart the sky huge meteors trail Their scintillating globes of varied hues:â Now in the dense clouds dip, eclips'd and lost;â Now they emerge, and, like the ravenous bird Hovering above his prey, coast slowly on In track erratic,âor with sudden rage Dart through the vast of air, or down to earth Bursting and sparkling:âwhile from the deep pit Of dire Vesuvius hurl'd, fly burning rocks High arching through the air, with glow intense Kindling the heavens, and through the boisterous wind Roaring. Up to the clouds fly some, a bow Of crimson radiance painting on the sky,â Then harmless in the ocean plunge and die. But many on that hapless city fall;âat once Through roofâthrough strong-beam'd floors, resistless sinks The heated rock;âdown to the earth it goes:â Tremble and crack the walls,âor overthrown By that tremendous stroke, in ruins lie:â A shriek perchance is heard;âbut instant starts The hollow-sounding flame, in the rough wind Wafting and moaning.â What a night is this! Ye miserable remnants of a race, Not three days since in wealthâin easeâin joy O'ersated;âblaming if the sun too bright Shone on your path,âor if too rude the breeze Came to your pamper'd cheeks;âif your nice meats, Not truly temper'd to fastidious taste, Gave cause enough for wrath;âor if your wines Their crystal clearness had not,âOh! what change! What awful change ye know!âBut yet awhile Endure your ills!âto-morrow ye shall know Nor painânor griefânor fear;âmean time all these And woes on woes unspeakable must ye feel While yet ye breathe and live.âOh! give me wordsâ Spirit of horrorsâfrom the tongues of hell;â Such as the damn'd, to paint their agonies And terrors, can alone inventâthis scene Of dread unutterable to pourtray, Though colours for such picture all too faint!â A city from whose roofs a thousand fires Shook their red flags;âon which the furious wind Drove ashes and hot coals in crimson showers, Thick as against some mountain's lofty side The wintry blast flings the slant cloud of hail, And rain and cutting sleet;âbeneath which roll'd The earth as 'twere an ocean;âon which fell, Like comets from their orbits loosed, huge rocks Red hot, and with a sound tearing the air, Such as amid the branches of the oak The rushing tempest makes; and over which Thick smoke and vivid lightnings, like a strife Between the shadows and the fires of hell, Darken'd and vollied.âSuch the hideous fate Those miserables proved.âThe cries of pain, Of terror were not heard,âwith such a voice The thunders call'd,âso rumbled over head, As though the vault of heaven had been a drum Smote on by angry gods with thunderbolts.â Here yelling lay, though even himself heard not, A wretch, with eyes distorted and pursed brow, Grinning and foaming blood:âbeneath the weight Of a vast beam on fire, his lower parts Were crush'd and burning:âon the red hot wood The veins still spouted out the crimson tide.â He begg'd for deathâand heaven in mercy heard;â With sudden heave the earthquake lifted up The ponderous timber, that upon his head Fell down againâand instant press'd out life.â There one on whom the flash had glanced, and left Alive, though with all power of motion gone, Or speech:âhelpless he lay;ânow by the stream That still, though with diminish'd current, flowed, A little way wash'd on,ânow left, like weed By the sea side, that sometimes on the wave Is tost,âsometimes upon the beach left dry.â And powerless as that weed was he;âyet sense Of pain perchance he had, for his white face, Tranquil, though ghastly, strange distortion shew'd As on his belly fell a glowing coal That in his bowels gnaw'd and hiss'd:âyet strength To turn or cast the burning plague away He had not;âso he lay till, sudden swell'd, The flood came on and roll'd him slowly down, With face now tow'rds the sky,ânow bent on earth, And arms all helpless turning as he turn'd, And thus at length he died.â Howling and mad With swell'd and lolling tongues, and eyes of blood, And jaded, staggering step, here dogs in troops Roam'd through the streets:âo'er many a dying man, And many a mangled carcase, heedless past, In their unceasing course:âor only paused A moment in the steaming blood to slake Their burning thirst,âthen lifted up again Their madden'd howl;âand with their low-hung heads Swell'd hideously, and swaying to their tread, Toil'd heavy-gaited on. There on the roofs Of burning buildings, of a hue as red As the red flames around them, might be seen Figures of menâand females with their robes Streaming before the wind;âin agony Of terror running to and fro, with hands And faces lifted up to heaven for help.â Faster they hurry on;âthe flames are nigh; In the bright light you may their features see, Their squared and glaring eyesâtheir brows deep plough'dâ Their wide and hideous grin.âAh! see! some rush With spreading arms into the flame:âsome pause A moment on the tottering brink to look Before them at the precipice,âbehind At the advancing flame,âthen howling leap Head downwards, and upon the marble flags Lie shatter'd:âsome whom courage nor despair Could urge to hasten death, stay yet awhile In flame and smoke enveloped, till at once Burst in the roofs, and, shrieking, down they fall With arms and legs outstretch'd and stiff, to glut The ravenous element. At times there come, Rushing like tempest, horses from their stalls Broke loose:âcream'd o'er with foam:âfire from their eyes Flashing:âtheir nostrils wide and bloody red:â They flyâthey stopâthey glare aroundâstart backâ Shrink trembling to the earth, dropping thick sweat:â Their manes are bristled high;âquick heave their flanks, Their mouths are wide and ghastly.âThen again They leap erectâstartâstare aroundâand fly Frantic and shriekingâheadlongâblind with fearâ In clouds of smoke and flame and burning coals Mingling and glancing back again. And here Were men, by fear to raving madness driven, Yelling like wolves at midnight, when the scent Of blood regales their nostrils.âOthers sate On carcases upheap'd, and stupidly Gaped round like ideots.âBut one there was, A man of noble bearing, with a look That might become a god;âan eye that seem'd Fitted to govern empires, and to pierce The darkness of the future, and behold Events yet growing there:âon this dread scene Thoughtful he gazed, yet calm:âbeside him walk'd, Supported on his arm, his trembling wife Covering her eyes; and by the hand he led A lovely shrinking boy. Round them fell thick The ashy shower:âbefore them frequent roll'd The glowing rocks:âwith direful crash came down The burning walls:âthe lightnings at their feet Struck up the earth;âthe father's face grew pale;â He saw resistless fate at hand, and fear'd The dreadful deaths that thousands felt might fall On those he loved:âthen struck he on his breast, And, pausing, drew a glittering dagger forth, And dealt them both a sudden blow of mercy:â Kiss'd them in death, then turn'd tow'rds heaven a look Of supplication; and, with steady hand, Gazing the while on those his loved ones slain, As though his fate deserved no thought, he drove The steel deep in his heartâand instant died.â An old grey-headed man was tottering on He knew not whither:âoften he look'd up At that strange sky with wild and troubled face, Still muttering as he went.âHis fate was blest; For, as he hurried on, a vivid bolt Struck his bare head; and, ere he reach'd the earth, To a black, brittle cinder burnt him up. But miserable above all were they The dungeon captives, by their ponderous chains Chain'd to the ground:âhelplessâand hopeless:âfar From aid of man, or kindly sympathy, Cheering though vain:âtheir subterranean cells No safeguardâfor the thunders roll'd above, And through the earth below:âthe lightnings pierced Their dens profound, now first illumined bright Only to show the swaying walls,âthe earth Cracking and closing back:âthe arched roofs Heaving and grinding, stone 'gainst splintering stone; Each moment threating hideous ruin down, Yet still delaying:âwhile the wretches shrunk, As they look'd up with agonized face, And call'd on God to help:âor loud exclaim'd On wives or children whom they never more Might clasp within their arms. Oh! then they tugg'd In frenzy at their fetters:âgnash'd their teethâ And howl'd in misery and despair:âfiercely They stamp'd upon the earth:âclench'd their hard hands, And smote themselves,âand, cursing bitterly, Vehement at their irons dragg'd again.â A long and dreadful struggle.âVain!âthey sink Exhaustedâbreathlessâcalm:âthe calm of death To some:âto others but a fearful pause, While life, and strength, and energy return To torture them anew.âThey cannot 'scape:â As well with their weak hands they might hold up The reeling walls, or prop the pile above, When the strong arch has burst beneath the shock Of the raging ground, as from their rocky bed The deep driven, massy staples tear away, Or break their iron links. There was a man, A Roman soldier, for some daring deed That trespass'd on the laws (as spirits bold And young will oft from mere impulse of blood, And from no taint of viciousness, o'erleap The boundaries of right), in dungeon low Chain'd down. His was a noble spirit, rough, But generous, and brave, and kind. While yet The beard was new and tender on his chin, A stolen embrace had given a young one claim To call him father:â'twas a rosy boy, A little faithful copy of his sire In face and gesture. In her pangs she died That gave him birth; and ever since the imp Had been his father's solace and his care. By day his play-fellow and guard, He made him mimic shields and helms of straw, And taught him how to use his falchion dire Of lath: to leap; to run; to lie in ambush close; To couch his little spear;âhis wooden steed With fiery eyes, and arching neck, and ears For ever, as they caught the sounds of war, erect, Fearless to mount and tame in all his pride: By night the boy was pillow'd on his arm. At morn they rose together; in the woods At spring time to hunt out the squirrel's nest; Or of their spotted eggsâor chirping young To spoil the timid birds:âor through the fields, Spangled with dewy diamonds, would they roam To pluck the gaudy flowers:âor in the brook Would snare the glittering fry:âor banks of mud With mighty toil thrown up, throw down again, For childhood's weighty reasons. Every sport The father shared and heighten'd. But at length The rigorous law had grasp'd him, and condemn'd To fetters and to darkness. He had borne His sentence without shrinking, like a son Of that imperial city at whose frown Earth's nations shook;âand would have bid adieu To the bright heavens awhile, and the green earth, And the sweet air, and sweeter liberty,â Nor would have utter'd plaint, nor dress'd his face That loved to smile in sorrow's livery;â But when he took that boy within his arms, And kiss'd his pale and frighten'd face; and felt The little heart within his sobbing breast Beating with quick, hard strokes,âand knew he tried, Child as he was, to keep his sorrows hid From his fond father's eye;âOh! then the tears Fast trickled down his cheeks;âhis mighty heart Seem'd bursting:âstrong, convulsive sobbings choked His parting blessing. With averted head, (For when he look'd upon that innocent face He felt a burning in his brain that warn'd Of madness if he gazed, such torturing thoughts Came crowding with each look) he blest, embraced, And bade his boy farewell.â The captive's lot He felt in all its bitterness:âthe walls Of his deep dungeon answer'd many a sigh And heart-heaved groan. His tale was known, and touch'd His jailor with compassion;âand the boy, Thenceforth a frequent visitor, beguiled His father's lingering hours, and brought a balm With his loved presence that in every wound Dropt healing. But in this terrific hour He was a poison'd arrow in the breast Where he had been a cure.â With earliest morn Of that first day of darkness and amaze He came. The iron door was closed,âfor them Never to open more! The day, the night Dragg'd slowly by; nor did they know the fate Impending o'er the city. Well they heard The pent-up thunders in the earth beneath, And felt its giddy rocking; and the air Grew hot at length, and thick; but in his straw The boy was sleeping; and the father hoped The earthquake might pass by; nor would he wake From his sound rest th' unfearing child, nor tell The dangers of their state. On his low couch The fetter'd soldier sunkâand with deep awe Listen'd the fearful sounds:âwith upturn'd eye To the great gods he breath'd a prayer;âthen strove To calm himself, and lose in sleep awhile His useless terrors. But he could not sleep:â His body bnrn'd with feverish heat;âhis chains Clank'd loud although he moved not: deep in earth Groan'd unimaginable thunders:âsounds, Fearful and ominous, arose and died Like the sad moanings of November's wind In the blank midnight. Deepest horror chill'd His blood that burn'd before:âcold clammy sweats Came o'er him:âthen anon a fiery thrill Shot through his veins. Now on his couch he shrunk And shiver'd as in fear:ânow upright leap'd, As though he heard the battle trumpet sound, And long'd to cope with death. He slept at last, A troubled dreamy sleep. Well,âhad he slept Never to waken more! His hours are few, But terrible his agony. The night Dragg'd slowly by:âthe hours of morning pass'd:â The gory sun had shown his mocking light In the red heavens a moment, and gone back To his deep shrine of darkness:ânight had come At noon upon the earth:âthe heavy floods Of black and steaming rain had fallen:âbut they, That miserable sire and son knew not, And sleep was heavy on them. Soon the storm Burst forth: the lightnings glanced:âthe air Shook with the thunders. They awoke;âthey sprung Amazed upon their feet. The dungeon glow'd A moment as in sunshine,âand was dark:â Again a flood of white flame fills the cell; Dying away upon the dazzled eye In darkening, quivering tints, as stunning sound Dies throbbing, ringing in the ear. Silence, And blackest darkness.âWith intensest awe The soldier's frame was fill'd; and many a thought Of strange foreboding hurried through his mind, As underneath he felt the fever'd earth Jarring and liftingâand the massive walls Heard harshly grate and strain:âyet knew he not, While evils undefined and yet to come Glanced through his thoughts, what deep and cureless wound Fate had already given.âWhere, man of woe! Where wretched father! is thy boy? Thou call'st His name in vain:âhe cannot answer thee.â Loudly the father call'd upon his child:â No voice replied. Trembling and anxiously He search'd their couch of straw:âwith hÃ¨adlong haste Trod round his stinted limits, and, low bent, Groped darkling on the earth:âno child was there. Again he call'd:âagain at farthest stretch Of his accursed fetters,âtill the blood Seem'd bursting from his ears, and from his eyes Fire flash'd,âhe strain'd with arm extended far And fingers widely spread, greedy to touch Though but his idol's garment. Useless toil! Yet still renew'd:âstill round and round he goes, And strains and snatches,âand with dreadful cries Calls on his boy. Mad frenzy fires him now:â He plants against the wall his feet;âhis chain Grasps;âtugs with giant strength to force away The deep-driven staple;âyells and shrieks with rage, And like a desert lion in the snare Raging to break his toils,âto and fro bounds. But see! the ground is opening:âa blue light Mounts, gently waving,ânoiseless:âthin and cold It seems, and like a rain-bow tint, not flame; But by its lustre, on the earth outstretch'd, Behold the lifeless child!âhis dress is singed, And over his serene face a dark line Points out the lightning's track. The father saw,â And all his fury fled:âa dead calm fell That instant on him:âspeechless, fix'd he stood, And with a look that never wander'd, gazed Intensely on the corse. Those laughing eyes Were not yet closed,âand round those pouting lips The wonted smile return'd. Silent and pale The father stands:âno tear is in his eye:â The thunders bellowâbut he hears them not:â The ground lifts like a sea:âhe knows it not:â The strong walls grind and gape:âthe vaulted roof Takes shapes like bubble tossing in the wind:â See! he looks up and smiles;âfor death to him Is happiness. Yet could one last embrace Be given, 'twere still a sweeter thing to die. It will be given. Look! how the rolling ground, At every swell, nearer and still more near Moves tow'rds the father's outstretch'd arm his boy:â Once he has touch'd his garment;âhow his eye Lightens with loveâand hopeâand anxious fears! Ha! see! he has him now!âhe clasps him roundâ Kisses his face;âputs back the curling locks That shaded his fine brow:âlooks in his eyesâ Grasps in his own those little dimpled handsâ Then folds him to his breast, as he was wont To lie when sleepingâand resign'd awaits Undreaded death. And death came soon, and swift, And pangless. The huge pile sunk down at once Into the opening earth. Wallsâarchesâroofâ And deep foundation stonesâall mingling fell!â Few in this time of peril and dismay The sole, and desperate chance for safety tried, For reason was bewilder'd:âcould they leave The fated city walls, a feeble hope Might yet remain:âthat, till the storm burst out, The intensity of darkness had forbid;â They now had light enough,âthough like the waves Of the enraged Atlantic, when the winds Have bared its frightful depths, where darkling sleep For ages the huge monsters of the abyss Obscene,âand higher than the eagle's flight Have lifted up the surge,âroll'd on the clouds Of pitchy and sulphureous smoke, whose shade Would seem a tenfold night,âbut through them broke A thousand lightnings, and around them glanced, And roll'd, and hiss'd, upon the glistening earth. But useless now that light:âno trace remain'd Of roads frequented:âfar as eye could reach, In the short moments when the shifting wind Bore off the ashy showers and clear'd the view A bed of black and smoking ashes, quench'd With rain, alone was visible:âthe trunks Of trees, leafless and branchless, peer'd above Their burning mantle,âwarning him whose feet Would seek for safety there, that death could reach Alike the fields or city. Yet were some Who tried the desperate venture:âevery where Rivers new form'd swept on with ashes gorged:â Who 'scaped the stream, was by the lightning slain;â Who 'scaped the lightningâby the burning rocks, That fell like hail-stones round, met death. One man Alone survived to tell the tale and die A maniac. Now too came a hasty glance, As for a happy moment the fierce blast Blew off the darkening smoke and fiery shower, Of the dire fury, whose remorseless rage, Till then unknown, had all these cureless woes Heap'd on them. Clear as if the noon day sun Shot down his brightest rays, the giant bulk Stood out of grim Vesuvius, late the soil Where the ripe vineyards groan'd beneath the loads Of richest fruits, scattering sweet perfume round That even to breathe the air was luxury:â On whose soft swelling side, unnumber'd stood The marble villas, glittering 'gainst the green Of nature's simple vest,âthe boast of wealth; Where pleasure sought its most fantastic joys, And grief seem'd never known:âbut now its banks Are red and burning with the glowing coals And masses vast of blazing rock that roll Impetuous down.âRight upward to the sky, In circuit large as some deep bay where rides A navy from the winds and roaring waves Secure,âa pillar of bright fire intense Shoots its vast shaft, as though to prop the heavens Lest thunders rock it down;âand o'er its top, Waving and shaking in the furious wind, Billows on billows roll of thickest smoke, Cut through and sprinkled by the sun-like blaze Of myriad ponderous rocks,âin the deep pit Of unimaginable heat below To its own fervour raised,âthen, with the speed And dazzle of the lightning launch'd in air Right upward, far beyond the ken of man,â Till in the stilly regions of the sky, Past even the din of this strange uproar,âwhere The stars are softly twinkling, and the air, Cold, pure, and thin, glides gently on, or rests In deep repose as in another world, Where even the wreck of this had not been known;â The fiery globes, their lustre and their heat Deaden'd and spent, with lagging speed awhile Climb upâand stop:âa moment in the air Balanced and motionless;âthen downâdownâsinkâ Faster and faster every instantâdown They hurry on with speed that mocks the eye, Till on the earth, or chance in the wide gulf Whence first hurl'd forth, they sink. With course aslant Are others thrown, like rainbows spanning o'er The vaulted sky,âbut with the vivid beam Of flying suns:âand on the fierce wind rush Dense showers of red-hot cinders: while adown The mountain's side, from a vast chasm spew'd forth, A torrent wide and deep of liquid fireâ The bowels of the earth, by heat intense Melted,ârolls down its thick and heavy waves In slow but irresistible course. The earth Is furrow'd for a channel where it goes:â The sturdiest treesâthe strongest buildings sink Before its might, as falls beneath the scythe The tender grass in June:âand on the groundâ And round the mountain's sideâand o'er its mouthâ And through the sea of jetty vapour,âglance Unintermitting lightnings.â Such appear'd Vesuvius for a moment to the eye That in the city yet could look on aught; But only for a moment. As they gazed, With crash as though earth's deep foundations sunk In hideous ruinâlo! the mountain's top And half its burning sides into the gulf Of fire sink down; loud roaring,âflashing high A firmament of star-like sparkles, mix'd With seas of belching smoke:âand rocks, so vast That on their roomy summits warlike towers Or temples their foundations might have cast,â Rise burning red into the kindling clouds Roaring like angry ocean.â Sweeping back On the strong tempest's wing, the direful cone Of mingled fire and darkness, from the mouth Of the red mountain upward to the sky And down to earth flung out; upon them came With doubling force and fury. Thicker fell The showers of ashes and of burning coals;â Louder the tempest howl'd along the air;â The thunders roar'd with height'ning madness out;â And the earth shook as though in pangs of death Rack'd and convulsed. Despair or madness now Seized every mind. Of those who yesterday Had lived, not half remain'd. Theseâtorpidâlost, Alike indifferent seem'd to life or death:â Seated on earth, or on the heaps of dead, The lightning's flash they reck'd not, though it roll'd Even at their feet:âthe glowing rock fell nigh, But they regarded not:âon him who sunk Beside them dead, they cast no look,âthey felt No pity:âthough the rudely tossing walls Seem'd toppling o'er their heads, they shrunk not back, They ask'd nor death nor life. There others, wild, Drunken and rioting in misery, Ran furious through the streets,âlaughing aloud, Shouting and leapingâcovetous of death, And sporting in its horrors. With drawn sword Bright flashing at he shook it o'er his head, His wild eyes glowing in his blood-stain'd face, One bounded with huge strides and maniac grin, And struck at all he met;âand, as the blood Spun out, would pause, and with ferocious look Like madman's half, half like the murderer's smile Who sees his victim dying,âdip his hand In the hot stream,âthen shout and haste away With frantic gesture, flourishing his blade, To seek another banquet. Soon he saw A fury like himself,âand they shook hands As friends long parted, unexpected met In some far land;âthen, at each other's breast Pointing their swords, together rush'd and fell:â Each at the other's death-wound smiledâand died.â There stood within a square a bloody man Who with bared arm was brandishing an axe:â His fellows round laugh'd merrily to see How at a blow he had beat out the brains Of one who begg'd him slay him. One by one They lay upon the earth, and he struck out Their brains;âand still the standers by laugh'd loud And came to die in turn, till all were slain Save the blood-spatter'd slayer. Then he threw His axe upon the ground, and wiped his brow, And staring stupidly at heaven,âlaugh'd out To see the war of fire and darkness there:â The big black clouds, like rocks of blackest jet Rolling impetuous, tumbling in the blast,â Pond'rous as ironâshadowy as the grave,â Seeming to threat the world with endless night; And then thick-coming lightnings, through and through Piercing their deep abysses;âwrapping round Their strong mark'd-edges with broad lines of fire Like skirtings from the solid sun cut out:â Now darkness for an instant,âand now light;â A cloud of ashes here like wintry storm At midnight;âthere bright showers of coals red-hot Pelting aslant and running on the earth With glow as of a furnace.âAt this strife He laugh'd incessant, but nigh to him fell A mass of burning stone:âharsh jarr'd the ground Like ship that strikes a rock, and high up flew Thick clouds of ashes and of shiver'd earth Driven by the dreadful blow:âquick rising then The whirling fragment on the axe-man struck, And scatter'd far and wide his flesh and limbs Still quivering:âthen onward held its course, Roaring and sparkling,âploughing up the ground, And bounding through the air,âtill in a bed Of ashes choked, it stopp'd, and growl'd, and smoked.â But there a youthful female, of a form Perfect as beauty's goddess,âwith her locks Of amber streaming on the wind, and vest Loose floating, saunter'd on and rock'd A headless infant in her arms:âshe sung The mother's song who soothes her restless babe To slumber:âsometimes look'd she on the heavens With pale and wistful face,âyet still she sung, Nor seem'd to know what horrors girt her round;â Sometimes upon the mutilated corse She bent a wild and strangely troubled look, But still her hush-song kept:âpoor wretch! she sunk Exhausted on the warm and ashy bed, And a death swoon came o'er her:âthere she lay Pale as a snow drop, with soft, open eye, And lips apart, on which with her last breath The mother's love-strain trembled,âand the babe Was folded to her bosom. There was none To helpâand so she died.â A wretched man, His wife,âtwo blooming daughters,âand a son,â A youth of tender years and spirit soft,â Had left their rocking home, and left behindâ For terror stiffen'd every aged limb, That he seem'd stone,âthe father's reverend sire. They did not much implore him to be gone, For horrors such as these can dull the soul Of finest sensibility, and fix All thought on self alone;âcan load the brain With heavy apathy, that death, or life, Pleasure, or pain, seem but indifferent things, Not worthy choice or shunning;âor sometimes, As different natures different feelings prompt,â With unimaginable rage they fire The wretch,âfierce,âroaring madness; that would rend Himselfâthe worldâthe heavens,âand gloat on blood, And laugh at torments. They had left their door, And stagger'd to the street,âand turn'd again To look on their grey sire, where, like a form By cunning chisel from the marble wrought, He sat amazed and motionless,âwhen lo!â Red glowing like a ruby, from the sky A ponderous rock descends:âthey see it sink Through the strong roof:âthe mighty oaken beams Snap like burnt twigs:âthey see a light within;â They hear a crashâa jar:âthe walls go down In blaze and smoke:âthey hear the buried rock Burning below:âtheir home is fallen:âtheir sire Lies in the wreck. Their senses were wreck'd too; And down they sat in silence on the earth, And watch'd the rising flame. That tender boy Had ta'en his mother's hand, and griped it hard Unconsciously:âshe, as unconscious sat And stared upon the sky. One daughter lay Outstretch'd as if in sleep,âbut she was dead;â And over her the sister lean'd, and told In whispers of a horrid dream she dreamt; And begg'd her not to sleep lest she should dream: Anon she started upright on her feet: Look'd wildly roundâand tip-toe walking, stole, With finger on her lip and head turn'd back, As though she fear'd that in the direful roar And ruin round her foot-tread might betray And thwart the end she ponder'd,âtill she reach'd The burning building:âlightly then she sprung With a short laugh of triumph in the flames, And soon was still. Did then the parents shriek, And tear their hair,âand call on death to end Their miseries? Noâthey sat in quietness, As though the deed concern'd not them, nor call'd For pity or amazement. Screaming shrill, That tender boy next backward fell to earth, With every limb outstretch'd and stiff;âhis eyes Wide glaringâand his face distorted strange. Awhile he shriek'dâthen quiver'dâand expired. A momentary pang his mother seem'd To feel;âfor she turn'd round, and look'd intent On his black face, like one who dreads some ill Impending, or perhaps already fallen, but where, Or howâor whenceâunknown. His slacken'd hand She took again at length,âand, as before, Sunk in a stupid silence. By her side, With elbows propp'd upon his knees,âand cheeks Pillow'd upon his hands,âthe father sat Like one in some sequester'd spot deep wrapt In day dreams,âwhom no sound of voice, or step Of human thing intrusive, may disturb In his lone musings:âbut he did not muse:â His mind was dark and vacant:âhe beheld Things as he saw them not:âhis very soul Was blank and feelingless. His only boyâ His daughters, dearer than his life belov'd, Unmov'd he saw expire:âand now, alas! Their mother he beholds in frenzied mood Stand over him, with threats and curses deep Vow'd on his head: but he regarded not:â Fiercely she struck him in her rage, and dragg'd The hairs from his bow'd head:âbut he was mute. Then, yelling, from the earth she snatch'd her boy And bore him off:âher eyes seem'd burning coals:â Her hair dishevell'd stream'd around:âshe foam'd And grinn'dâa raging maniac.âStriding wide, She hurried on her way;ânow to her breast The corpse hard hugging:ânow along the ground She dragg'd him by his flaxen hair, and struck His tender head against the stony way:â Then stopp'd a moment,âsilent;âsnatch'd again The batter'd body to her arms:âimprest Fast, burning kisses on his lips and brow:â Look'd for an instant on the horrid sky;â Yell'dâshriek'dâand strode along.â Her miseries Now found a pause:âbeneath her weary feet The earth rock'd giddily:âshe stagger'dâran;â Beneath the load she bore with force driven on, Head foremost to the ground fell:âthe spinal bone Snapp'd shortâand she was dead.â But there sat he, The wretched husband of this wretched wifeâ The woful father of that family Of woe;âthere quietly he sat, and look'd Or seem'd to look, on what befell,ânor spakeâ Nor weptânor aught appear'd to know:âand there He might have staid till, slowly sinking down, Nature oppress'd had yielded up the strife;â But,âdrifting furiously before the wind,â An ashy shower came like a mighty wave, And whelm'd him in its suffocating depths. High o'er his head it piled,âround and around Tost in a whirlwind,âthat another course Soon shaped,âand left exposed the grinning corseâ Shrivell'dâand shrunkâand black.â One man there was, A noble of the city, and approved For wisdom, who in frenzy of his brain Had back'd his swiftest horse;âsaddle nor rein He had,âand useless had they been to guide A courser frantic as his madman lord:â His head was bare;âbehind his shoulders stream'd A mantle of deep black,âand with one hand He held against his mouth a hunting horn, On which he blew incessant.âNot a tone Could reach his ear amid the uproar round, Yet still, with cheek distended and red eye, He wound the blast. Swift as the tempest flew, With mane erect, and rolling eyes of fire, And crimson nostril spread,âthe ebon steed:â O'er dead and living bounded he along:â O'er burning ruins and o'er blacken'd streams Vaulted;âand still the rider blew his horn And kept his dangerous seat.âThe lightning fell At the horse's feet,âbut, snorting, he sped on;â The blazing building thunder'd on the earth;â The burning rock flew roaring o'er his head;â But still right on he went.âAnother flash Quivers upon the brazen hunting horn;â The rider sprawls on earth;âthe steed is blindâ Yet wildly rushes forward;âtill, dash'd full Against a fallen column, high in air Spouts the red bloodâthe brains fly scattering round; And down he sinks dead,âheavy as a clod.â All seem'd to covet death. With arms wide spread As to a friend's embrace, crowds headlong rush'd Into the boiling sea:âand as the waves Threw them again upon the sands, they rose, And, looking back upon the fiery plague, And the red heavens, and reeling city, ran Shrieking and wildly laughing back again, Plunging and struggling to be gone. See! see! From yon high cliff they leap:âman hurries man:â One pushes down a loiterer on the brink, Then casts himself head-foremost, as he fear'd To fall too late. None stays to bid farewell To brother, parent, husband, sister, wife;â They rush like furious dogs upon the chace,â And death their game. Look where yon mother drags Along the beach her little son:âa babe Lies at her breast convulsed. Her bright, wild eye Tells of despair,âinsanity:âshe seeks Death, her sole refuge:âyet a mother's love Lives after reason's wreck. She stops, and looks Now on the heavy-rolling deep,âand now Upon her helpless little ones. She hears The roaring mountain nowâand rending earthâ Sky-bursting thundersâand the fearful rush Of fiery rocks;âand, cowering, hastens on For shelter to the waves:âbut then she hears, As on its marge she sudden stops, the voice Of the perturb'd unfathomable deep;â Th' expiring cry of some who struggling sink Into the dark abyss:âand mid the foam Sees rocking carcases,âand ugly shapes Of ocean monsters, from their beds obscene Torn by th' upheaving billows to the day:â And gleaming, anguish'd eyes she marks at times Peering among the watery hills, of men Who sought death thereâyet were afraid to die: And she too fear'd,âand hugg'd her little-ones Hard in her arms, and look'd with anxious face At that terrific firmamentâthat hill Of flameâthat rack'd and groaning groundâthat sea With its appalling sights and sounds;ânor knew Or how to liveâor which way she should die:â But fate decides the struggle;âand the waves, Rising at once like a huge wall, come on And wash her back, with hundreds who were nigh, To the dark deep.â One in the city brought His chariot forth,âand madly deem'd the steeds Would know their master's hand, and bear him far From this accursed region;âso he leap'd Swiftly into the seat, while, shrinking back, Trembling and dropping sweat from every pore, The horses paused an instant. Then he laugh'd As though the feat were done, and all secure:â But when he wish'd to whirl the thong, and seize The ruling reins,âunhappy wretch!âhe found No reins, no scourge had he;âand down to earth He would have sprung;âbut o'er the courser's heads A bulky red rock flew, roaring along Like cataract, when its tumbled waters boil, And heave, and foam in their deep bed below:â So close it pass'd aboveâtheir bristling manes Crackled and smoked. As follows on the flash The thunder-peal, so sudden sprung the steeds On their delirious course. The wheels plough deep;â The ashes whirl around as though the car Drove on through waters:âheavy is the road, But mighty are the horsesâand terror Has made their nerves like steel. Onâonâthey urge; The rider shrieksâand throws his arms aloftâ His hair streams in the wind.âNo pause, no check, The madden'd coursers know:âbounds up and down, From side to side, the car:ânow on two wheels Balancedâit runs;âthe others whirl on high:â Now they descendâand now again a shock Tosses aloft the chariot from the ground;â Swift through the air it spins, like Juno's car Smooth gliding, noiseless, through the sky,âthen lights On earth again, rebounding as it falls;â But ever on it flies.âThe town is left Behind their rustling wheels:âthe hill is long, And steep th' ascent;âbut as the rein-deer skims The light sledge on the flat and glassy ice, So the strong horses through the ashy bed And 'gainst the hill whirl on the ponderous car.â They reach the level top:âalong the ridge Straight tow'rds the sea they rush:âOh! turn aside, Ye fury steeds, from your insensate course!â The cliffs are highâthe ocean foams below:â Will not the wide black torrent make you pause?â Will not the driving fire shower on your flanks? Will not the hailing rocksâthe hissing boltsâ Divert your headlong track?âNo!âonâstill onâ Right tow'rds the sea they urge.âA meteor huge As the full rounded moon, before their eyes Bowls onâand round the beetling cliff shakes out Thick corruscations:âyet they turn not backâ Nor swerve aside.âOh! will no merciful flash Strike the mad horses deadâor ere they plunge Down that dire gulf!âAs if along the edge Of some big cloud the chariot rode through air, So high on the black mountain's lofty rim It look'd;âthick clouds of deepest dye behind Threw out the splendid chariot to the view, As though on the black sky it painted were In gold and burning sunshine:âthe bright brass Of the rich harness glittered:âflash'd along The viewless spokes:âThe carvings rare gleam'd out:â The white steeds stood like whitest marble forth From out a bed of jet:âtheir manes stream'd up From their strong circling necks;âtheir mouths were foam;â Their very eyes were seen to roll, and throw Red flames,âsuch brightness on them shone From the unceasing lightnings. Yet some space Between them and the awful steep there lies;â Perchance they yet may turn:âthe rider sits Stiffen'd with terror:âwith both hands he grasps The car:âhis face is deathy pale:âhe shrieks:â Onâonâthe horses fly. But see! a flash Plays round the chariot wheels:âthe rider sinks Backward upon the seat;âloose rolls his head;â His hanging arm swings helpless o'er the side:â Thank Heaven! he dies!âbut, all unharm'd, the steeds Rush on:âthat flash has fired the car:âthe flames Stream in the blast:âit seems day's chariot bright, As poets feign, hot blazing through the sky, Drawn by the steeds of fire.âOnâonâthey press;â Fast tow'rds the brink they come:âso deep below The ocean lies, that on a stilly day Its murmurings scarce can climb the dizzy height:â They reach the edgeâthey look not at th' abyssâ Right o'er they leap:âthey sinkâand paw the air:â Downâdown they fall:âthe chariot flames behind:â The wheels upon the axles glittering spin:â The lifeless driver headlong tumbles out,â Round and around with swinging limbs rolling:â Still down they sinkâscarce midway in their course;â The horses still, as though they spurn'd the earth, Throw out their sinewy legs:âanother bolt, Far streaming through the sky,âflashing blue flames, Strikes on them falling;âand the milk-white steeds A moment after in the waters dash Lifeless and scorch'd.âThÃ¨ chariot, hissing, sinks;â With sullen plash the dead man strikes the sea:â The waves roll over them;âtheir course is done. Meanwhile, still gathering fury, raged the storm; The winds rush'd through the city with the force Of mountain billows in a hurricane:â Down smote the crimson showers of burning coals;â Then up again on the resistless blast High as the clouds they flewâand round and round Wheel'dâfellâand roseâand dash'd on earth again, Swift as the stroke of lightning:âwith them mix'd Huge rolling waves of smoke intensely black And clouds of ashes.âCarcases of menâ Masses of blazing timberâtrees entire Torn from their roots, were tossing in the air Like chaff.âIt seem'd as though the globe itself With one terrific whirlwind were convulsed,â And this the centre of the horrid wheel. The closing hour is nigh:âlike dying man More fiercely struggling at his latest gasp,â The earthquakeâand the stormâand fiery hill, With fury tenfold raged:âthe thunders roll'd As though the very vault of heaven would burst:â The earth groan'd to its centre:âdireful chasms, Night-black and fathomless, open'd and shutâ And gaped againâand swallow'd in their jaws Houses and living menâand heaps of deadâ And palaces and streets entire. Deep down In the black gulf they sunk:âthe crashing earth Knit to again and crumbled them to dust.â The city like a forest in a storm Waved to and fro:âopposing houses struckâ And shiver'dâand fell down.âThe temple huge Of Jupiter the Thunderer, whose walls Of strength immense and deep foundations stood Unharm'd till now,âfix'd as some Alpine hill That from eternity has beenâand seems Destined to all eternity to beâ See! to and fro it heaves:âthe mighty dome, Like cedar's top beneath a raging wind, Swings heavy through the air:âthe thick walls crackâ Openâand closeâand open wide again:â Downâdown it thunders:âheadlong down to earth The ponderous fabric, crashingâgrinding fallsâ Making itself an earthquakeâand a din That mates the thunder.â But o'er all distinct,â The groans of earthâthe bellowings of the skyâ The whirlwind's howlâthe rush of burning rocksâ The whirring of the fiery showerâthe crash Of thousand ruins nearâo'er every sound Raising its hideous and undying voice, Vesuvius from its hollow crater roar'd;â A noise of thunders mix'd, and rushing floodsâ Tempestsâand worlds on fireâand oceans vast Boiling like cauldrons!âNever ceased its din;â Seem'd as the eternal fires that live within The hollow womb of earth,âhuge as appears To mortal eye the cavity of heaven,â Had from its mouth as from a trumpet breathed Their aggregated roarings.âAll the air Seem'd only soundâdenseâsolid sound, that like The depth of Egypt's darkness might be felt:â With stunning force, as of a mighty blow, It struck upon the ear that men fell down And died, who heard it.âTrees, and streams, and hills, Ev'n when the earthquake paused, were quivering still Beneath its dire concussions, and the dome Of heaven itself seem'd lifted up and down By that terrific uproar.âDistant lands Heard it and shudder'dâand gave thanks to God That they themselves were safe. On Afric's coast Far distant over lands and ocean wide The Moorish mother started from her sleep, And hush'd her frighted babe, and blest the name Of Allah as she listen'd to the sound. Now like a mighty river when with rains Surcharged it swells above its banks, and makes New channels for its fury,ârolling on Its heavy waves of liquid fire, came down The all-destroying lava. Like the hiss Of million angry serpents was the sound That went before it as the reeking earth,â The rain-streams, and whate'er of moist was near, Dried sudden up. The clear red torrent look'd Like molten iron from the furnace mouth Pouring;âbut such in bulk as if all earth Her mines had emptiedâand in the vast fires Of hell their mingled metals had been cast,â And thence from its wide jaws, in such hot flood Spew'd forth again.âThe tumbling of its waves Was like the rush of ocean, with deep moans Of thunder mix'd,âand the loud jar and shake Of countless armies,âand ten thousand cars Of iron fiercely rolling.âNot like stream From o'ergorged river, shallow at the first And gently deep'ning as the floods descend, But high in air its horrid ridge came on, Abruptâlike billow rushing to the shore In a strong tempest;âor as when the deeps Roll'd back, and stood like walls for Israel's host To pass the Red Sea's bed. At its approach The earth shook:ârocks split open and fell in, Melting like snow that sinks into the brook:â Green trees were turn'd to cinder at its touch:â Houses and streets to liquid fire were changed And swell'd the dreadful tide:âthe air above Seem'd melting too, and glow'd with fervent heat Like the terrific atmosphere of hell.â Onward it moves;âo'er half the city sweeps;â O'er mighty towersâand battled wallsâand holds Of strength, flows easy as the swelling wave Above the sea shore pebbles. Shriek nor groan Arose at its approach,âfor there was none That sawâor heardâor felt it;âall were dead;â With such destructive fury late the storm Of lightning and of wind had raged;âso thick The labouring earth had shook the ruins down;â So suffocating blew the scorching air. Close as along some heath that peasants fire At night, the curling flames ascend,âso fell The streaming flashes, as if heaven had sent A shower of fire for rain:âten thousand bolts Fell every instant, battling through the air Like sun-rays divers glinting from the facel Of restless waters. Through the city now The fire-flood goes, and in a cataract huge From the steep rocks pours down into the sea.â Right o'er, with sweep tremendous, the red stream Launches into the deep:âthe deep shrinks back Hissing and roaringâsteaming to the skiesâ Seething like hottest cauldron:âflashing up Torrents of boiling brine, and darkening all With clouds of densest mist. Again the waves Return;âagain the fiery cataract meets And drives it bellowing back.â But look! the earth In its last pang seems quaking:âback recoils The burning lavaârolling on itself:â The ground is lifted up:âthe city rides On the huge swell like bark upon the waves:â The sea, loud thundering, from the shore retires Far as the eye can reach.âThen sinks again The earth;âthe city sinks:âthe sea comes back, Piled in a ridge that seems to touch the sky:â Swift as the wind it comes;âit roarsâit foamsâ It shakes the inmost earth:âabove the cliffsâ Above the loftiest hills it towers;âit bursts:â The fires are instant quench'd:âthe lava stream Stopsâsolid.âBut again The ground with last convulsive struggle heaves; The sea hastes back:âthe dark and drench'd remains, Of that ill-fated city are lift up High, trembling, in the air:âthe giant rocks That gird the shores fall shivering to th' abyss:â The earth like a tempestuous ocean rolls, Sinking in hollowsârising into steeps.â Here in a trough the tallest pines sink down:â There, rivers lifted up on high, their floods Pour forth in vast cascades:âa forest here With its innumerous trees loud howling rides Aloft through air to seek another bed;â There, tumbled o'er, its branches root in earth, Its roots shoot out like branches. From the sea, Shouldering aside the waves, new islands peer, That look abroad awhile, then dive again, Making huge whirlpools as the waters rush To fill the mighty void:âand from the deeps Flames issue, shaking high their bloody flags, As for destruction's triumph.âHill 'gainst hill Clashes;âmountain to mountain nods.â Yawns then The groundâa dark terrific gulf:âat once The city sinks as in a sepulchre;â Deep down it sinks in that tremendous pit, Like ship that goes into the bottomless deep,â And the huge earth-waves close above, and seal Its everlasting tomb.â 'Tis gone! where late The mighty city stood no trace is left;â Its costly palacesâits splendid streetsâ Its awful templesâall are gone. Remains A dark-hued plain alone, whose rugged face The lessening lightnings plough;âo'er which the flood Of lava slowly settles in a lake.â Yearsâagesâcenturiesâshall pass awayâ And none shall tell where once that city stood. ABRADATES AND PANTHEA. The beautiful and touching story upon which the following short poem is founded occurs in Xenophon's life of Cyrus the Great. Panthea, a woman of incomparable beauty, and wife to Abradates, king of the Susans, was taken captive by Cyrus; who, instead of using the privilege then claimed by conquerors, treated her with the greatest delicacy and kindness. This generous forbearance came to the ears of Abradates, who, in the fulness of his gratitude, went over with his forces to Cyrus, and commanded under him the scythe-armed chariots in that great and decisive battle against CrÅsus which was fought in the vale of Thymbra. Abradates was killed, and Panthea in grief and despair stabbed herself and expired upon his body. The catastrophe, it will be found, has been somewhat altered. 'Twas on the morning of that fateful day When Cyrus met on Thymbra's spacious plain The mighty host by wealthy CrÅsus led.â Awful the hour when through the expectant camp The word was given to harness for the fight For warlike was the foe; four hundred times A thousand was his strength; in horsemen strong, And strong in Egypt's yet unconquer'd bands;â But Cyrus fear'd not, though his Persain men Not half their number told; for they were bred To hardship and fatigue; on coarsest fare They fed, despising luxury and sloth, And had been used to victory.âSo he made A sacrifice to God, and bade them arm To march against the foe. Then might be seen O'er all the stirring camp the polish'd arms Reflecting from the newly risen sun Millions of sparkling points. Pale looks were there, Yet not of terror, but that feeling high That thrills the soldier's frame, and lifts the soul To dare all possible things: and busy hands Were buckling armour on:âand swords were drawn And sheath'd again, and many-colour'd plumes Nodded o'er brazen helmets:âsteeds in mail Pranced underneath their gorgeous riders, clad In fiery scarlet and in glittering brass:â And there were chariots, dreadful to behold, With wheels scythe-arm'd: and the horses were clothed In trappings arrow-proof; two ranks of four Abreast, whirl'd the dire fury through the field.â There was a prince, whose wife in former war Was captive made by Cyrus;âand her charms Exceeded those of woman;âyet her mind Was fairer than her beauty; and her soul Grew to her husband.âCyrus saw, but scorn'd Such loveliness and virtue by a touch Unhallow'd to pollute; and when her lord Knew this forbearance, smit with gratitude, To Cyrus with his forces he repair'd And vow'd eternal friendship:âand that vow Till death he kept.âThe armed cars that day Commanded he in fight:âhis lovely bride Was named Panthea;âAbradates he.â When now the cuirass by his nation worn Of quilted linen, he was putting on, She brought him, smiling at his pleased surprise, For by her secret orders all was done, A helmet, bracers, bracelets, all of gold, Coat-armour to his length, and feathery plume Of vivid purple dye.âHer delicate hands Assisted to array him, while the tears She could not stay roll'd down her beauteous cheek, And sighs unheard by him came thick and deep. Yet, though she wept, she urged him to the race Of glory. Think, oh! think,âshe said,â What we to Cyrus owe:âhis prisoner, I Was to his pleasures forfeit;âwho of men But he, would for a captive woman's tears His privilege have waved?âfor nor by word, Nor loose regard, did he the blush of shame Call to my cheek;âbut with such chasten'd love As to a sister tender brothers show, He cheer'd my sorrowing soul; nor ransom ask'd For liberty restored that nicest mind Had doubted ere it gave. I told him then How in thy breast such noble deeds would wake A gratitude as noble:âand that life Would in thy thinking be too short a term To lavish in his service.âOnward then;â And by thy deeds this day let Cyrus know How thou dost prize his gift. But oh! my love, When the hot fury of the fight would urge To things that reason shrinks from; then, oh! then, Think on Panthea:âthink thou seest her left A wretched widow sinking o'er the sod That holds her only treasure; desolate,â Alone upon the earth,âbeyond the reach Of comfort or of hope. Pantheaâhushâ The prince replied:âthy words distract my soul,â Take off these glittering trappings, for my arm Hath not a soldier's vigourânor my heart Doth beat with wonted energy to day. Nay, then am I a traitress, smiling sweet, The lovely fair-one cried;âand she assumed A cheerfulness she felt not; for her heart Was fill'd with sad forebodings, and her eye Told of unspeakable pangs;âthou shalt not stain Thy spotless reputation for the dream Of silly fearful woman;âbe thy arm Strong as Leviathan amid the foe,â Thy heart like the desert lion's:âbetter die The hero's death, than live to taste of shame:â Remember Cyrusâfuture fameâand past;â And think sometimes on me. She saidâand wiped The tear-drops from her eye,âand round his arm Circled a golden tress:âthen to her breast Strain'd with a long embrace the form beloved. And kiss'd the lips she ne'er might kiss again.â Nor less the prince with fervent ardour glow'd:â He press'd her to his bosom, as though earth, Nay Heaven itself had nought for him beside;â Implored in silence Jove's protecting care, And every blessing on her lovely head That power supreme can give:âgazed on her face All pale and sorrowful, where misery strove To smile, but could not;âwiped away her tears; Whisper'd fond words of comfort;âbade her think Rather, how blest to meet again, than brood O'er parting apprehensions:âstrain'd her close; And stood in silence looking in her eyes, Vacant, and lost in torpitude of grief. But the voice of the trumpet cameâand his eye Lighten'dâand his face had the glow of morn,â And like the tramp of a distant steed, his heart Sounded.ââOh! Jupiter!â he cried, and raised To the blue vault his eyes,ââgrant that this day I may myself approve to such a king An ever-grateful friend,âto such a wife A not unworthy husband.ââThen he took One short and last embrace,âand bounded up With clattering arms into the shining car.â The snorting horses struck their restless hoofs Into the trembling earth.âUnable then To touch the form adored, Panthea press'd On the unconscious chariot where he rode A kiss of love.âThe circling wheels moved on;â From the bright scythes thick flashing lightnings came:â The hollow beat of the coursers' hoofs no more Sounded upon the ear:âthe glittering car Grew every moment less:âamid the hosts Of chariots and of horsemen soon it mix'd. Panthea press'd her aching eyes;âher heart Was deadly sick:âshe spake not, but her look Grew wild and terrified:âamong the tents She wander'd vacantly, like one in sleep Unknowing where he treads: then would she stop, And seem to catch faint distant sounds, that shot Like death chills o'er her face; her flashing eye Starting and wild,âwith open mouth, and brow Knit as in pain. But she grew calmer soon, And fell upon the earth, and sent to Heaven Prayers silent and unceasing; till she heard From the far plain, upon the breezes borne, The awful hymn of battle chaunted loud By Persia's ardent legions.âThen she knew The crisis was at hand:âall pale she rose; A moment listen'd to the inspiring sound That seem'd to fill the concave of the sky:â Clasp'd her white hands in agony;âlook'd up Imploringly to Heaven, with ashy lips Parted, yet motionless, and eye that seem'd Fix'd as in trance of death:âthen from her brow Dash'd the o'erhanging ringlets; seem'd to draw In one full breath a resolution high;â A moment longer listen'd to the swell Of the fast closing hymn;âthen drew her robe Of virgin whiteness round her delicate limbs, And paced with rapid step the deep trod road Toward the direful field. As she moved on, The solemn war-chaunt ceased; and in its stead Shoutings and cries horrific struck her ear, And a noise like distant thunder, or the coil Of struggling waters;âand she felt the earth Shake like a smitten drum;âfor the horsemen then, Ten times ten thousand, were in conflict join'd, And the chariots were lightning on. She spake not yet, But her heart throbb'd fast and loud, and o'er her came A chill like the touch of death:âher waving locks Felt stiffening into motion, and her feet Seem'd as they trod on air.âSo on she sped Till she had reach'd a hill, whose peak sublime O'erlook'd the scene of carnage. As she climb'd, Louder and louder came the din of fight, Like a gathering tempest groaning in the air; And soon the Assyrian banners caught her eye, And the glare of brazen armour:âand still on,â Too far for clear discernment, she beheld Flashings of steel, and horsemen scouring on, Pursuing or pursued, and clouds of dust That seem'd to reach the sky:âyet paused she not, Though now the golden Persian eagle raised His glittering wings aloft; and she might see Myriads of charging foot and tramping steeds: Still toil'd she upward, till, the summit won, Like a vast sea th' interminable vale Lay spread before her view. Oh! what a sight For woman's gentle eye! Like to the clouds Of all devouring locusts, that at noon With their innumerous legions load the air And bring thick darkness,âso unnumber'd seem'd Th' exterminating hosts. She closed her eyes, For they felt on fire;âthe airâthe earthâthe skyâ All seem'd in motion like the surge's heave.â She sicken'dâsunkâand for a moment lost Her senses and her misery.âBut the shoutsâ The clang of armsâthe thousand trumpet notes Bursting renew'd and terrible, aroused To sense of life and agonizing dread. The sun shone hot upon the plain:âhis rays Seem'd kindling into fire the myriad swords, Helmets, and cuirassesâand plates of brass, That flash'd upon her sight. Against Heaven's dome, Seem'd to leap up, and echo back, the din Of the unequall'd contest.âLike a dream,â A horrible vision o'er her heart it came, But yet she felt 'twas true. With piercing eye She search'd the field; a thousand deaths she saw,â But still her eye moved on:âhere squadrons fled,â There ralliedâfled againâand rallied still,â Nor drew Panthea's gaze:âthe form she sought Mingled not there,âand there her soul was not. In calmer hour how had one single death,â One wound awaked a sympathizing pang In her too tender breast!ânow thousands fall;â Horses and men in heapsâand o'er them tread Thousands who fall in turn;âstill sees she all, Scarce noting of the carnage:âyet at times The Persian shout of triumph struck her ear And shot a thrill of transport,âquickly past. Whereâwhere is Abradates?âonly him Seeks she amid the hosts.âWhat sees she now? She sees from far the lofty chariots whirl:â She hears faint distant shoutings:âsure his plume, His purple plume is there!â'tis lost againâ Again it gleamsâand fades:âsure 'tis his voice So clear and strong that cheers the fierce attack!â How the swift horses spurn the scattering earth! They comeâthey comeâa long and dreadful front; Three hundred ponderous chariots;âyoked to each Eight barb'd and mighty coursers,âwrapp'd in flames Incessant flashing from the iron wheels, The brazen trappings of the foaming steeds, The gilded breast-plates and the polish'd casques, And the dire scythes, on which the burning sun Trembles and glows in wreaths of living fire. Aloft in every car, erect and bold, The charioteer flies on, and whirls the lash, And shakes the clattering reins.â 'Tis he againâ She knows him now:âAh! better never known! Pre-eminent above the rest he stands, And points toward the foe. His voice she hears:â He stoops and smites the steeds:âwith tempest's force They thunder on:âbefore the rest he flies:â Alone upon the foe he comes:âwedged thick With close-lock'd shields and spears protruding far, Stands Egypt's phalanx firm!âvain! vain! he breaks, Like the bolt of Jupiter through the dense clouds, Deepâdeep into their ranks. O'er all that stood He rode resistless:â'neath the iron wheels, Shields, helmets, crackled loud:âthe spear in vain 'Gainst his mail'd horses struck;âemboss'd with foam, And fiercely snorting, through the thick array They hold their dreadful course:âbeneath their feet Whole hosts are trampled down.âAs some tall ship When the stiff tempest bellies every sail And bends the groaning masts,âwith sharpen'd prow And breast capacious, through the whitening waves Dashes her furious way,âso through the ranks Rode the proud chariot on; and as the keel Ploughs through the glowing deep,âthe scythed wheels so Cut through the sinking mass:âthrough shieldâthrough mailâ Through flesh and cracking bone, the steel holds on, And leaves the parted carcase in the dust Gushing out floods of blood.â Panthea's eye Saw nought of this:âsaw not,âheard not the shock,â Though now the unimaginable charge,â O'erwhelming and at once, of all that rank Of horrid engines sent its din to Heaven, Like crash of falling cities, when the earth Heaves and recoilsâand trembles in its rage;â Throws prostrate mountains;âlifts the valleys up In heavy surges;âsplits the eternal rocks, And makes the breezeless ocean dash the clouds.â She saw not this;âsaw not the mass condensed Of Egypt's valiant warriors sinking down As by the desert's death-blast:ânor the shouts Heard she;âthe cries of rageâof painâdespairâ The crash of shieldsâof armourâhelms and spears,â Splinter'd and crush'd beneath the grinding wheels:â She knew not this:âon one alone her eye, Her soul, her senses fix'd. Still roll'd his car,â The ranks still fell around:âbut slower now, Jaded with toil,âwith blood bespatter'd o'er, The blowing horses move.âWith carnage clogg'd, O'er heaps of slain the unsteady chariot drags, Heaving and swaying:âstill undaunted stands, Though now was no retreat,âthough far before, And on each side the flood of foes was spread;â Though round his head unnumber'd lances flew, And succour near was none;âstill in his car Undaunted Abradates ply'd the scourge, Still cheer'd his matchless coursers to their toil,â Still dream'd of fame when nought but death was nigh. Oh! then Panthea's agony came on:â Her hands were clasp'dâher eyes seem'd balls of fire:â She breathed not,âstirr'd not.âFor a while she saw The glittering chariot through the tide of men Urging its fateful way:âbut how it rocks! Like ship amid the angry billows tost, From side to side it swings:ârisesâand sinks,â And mounts again o'er hillocks of the slain. It cannot last:âthe intrepid charioteer Heaves giddy to and fro:âwith grasping hand He clings a moment to the toppling car,â Then headlong to the earth, with dreadful crash, Chariot and charioteer are overthrown, Never again to rise.â Panthea sawâ She heard th' exulting shoutsâshe shriek'dâconvulsed, Senseless and stiff she fell,âand misery Awhile forebore its victim. It was night:â Such fearful night as closes in the day Of mortal conflict.âHeaven's bright lamp was out,â But man with thousand flickering fires had spread The boundless plain, that mock'd his absent ray.â Silence was in the air:âthe beauteous gems Of nightâHeaven's radiant watch when, in his dark Pavilion Jove reposes, glow'd serene.â No moving cloud was seen:âthe lofty trees, The dew-steep'd grass, the dim and distant hills, All seem'd in sleep profound.âBut mortals waked:â The voice of pain was heardâthe deep'ning groanâ The burst of angerâand the sob of grief;â The loud lament;âthe dull monotonous tone Of grief-condoling friend:âloud laughter then From jovial groups unhurt who ply the bowl, And tell their feats that day. With toil oppress'd Some, on the naked ground outstretch'd in sleep, Breathe loud and heavily.âAlong the plain Quick moving torches glance:âlight female forms With hurried step are seeking through the field Husbands or loversâfathersâbrothers lost:â To many a ghastly face the torch is lower'd, And snatch'd in haste away:âo'er many a pale And gasping victim leans the wretched friend, And gives the useless cordial.âStaggering, weak, Just risen from the ground, and bleeding fast, Some unsupported wretch there totters on To seek uncertain help:âhe pauses oft And leans upon his sword, and feels the tide Of life fast ebbing from his wounds; then looks With anxious eye on the calm heaven, and sighs To think on wife and childâand far-off homeâ And scenes of infancy belovedâand friends Perhaps for ever lost.âOh! then his soul Sinks in him; and the stifling sob, that tells The breaking heart, is heard, as slow again He trembles on his way. The distant tread Of lonely horseman,âo'er the soft smooth sod Pattering, like summer rain-drops when the air Is hush'd, and heavy clouds, like rocks of jet Rising precipitous above the rim Of the horizon, threaten thunder nearâ Is heard at times: or neigh of wounded steed, Answer'd perchance by one who arches proud His neck unscathed;âwith all his armour on, Fearless and free roaming the darkling plain,â His rider with the dead.â There slowly moves The sorrowing group that in their arms bear off The dying man:âthe torch light on his face Throws its red glare, but cannot hide the hue Of ghastly death:âthe arrow in his breast Is rooted still, and quivers as they tread:â They seek the wearied leach;âbut fate prevents, And ere they pause the vital spark has fled! Such is the victor's portion! such the night That follows on the day of glorious fame, When Cyrus o'er the banded hosts of Greece, Of Egypt, and of Asia, conqueror stood.â His foes were scatter'd wide, or captive made, Or breathless on the field:âthe shouts of joy Had rent the evening air:âthe trophies waved,â The glittering spoils were won:âbut then the night Comes with its solemn feelings;âpomp and shows Are hid,âbut sad realities of woe, That sun can never cheer, nor darkness hide, Proclaim war's follies, and its desperate guilt.â Where is Panthea?âfar across the vale, In darkness and in solitude she sits On the cold earth:âoutstretch'd beside her lies The body of her lord,âand in her lap The pallid head is laid. Silence is round, Save from a little rill the murmur soft And melancholy;âsave from the far camp, In the deep hush of midnight dimly heard, Quick flitting noises, and anon the hum, On favouring breezes borne, of many tongues;â Or neigh of steed that seems to melt away In the vast air, so soft it strikes the sense. There, motionless and vacantâwith a heart Brokenâand crush'dâand wither'd, till the weight Of misery had brought its own relief, That torpor of the soul, when grief no more Can wake a pang, nor hope impart a smile;â There sat Panthea:âon her husband's face Her fix'd eyes bent:âher locks dishevell'd hung Adown her lovely neck.âThere through the night Wretched sat she,âand there she linger'd still When the grey morning dawn'd:âshe had not stirr'd; She had not sigh'd:âthe cold fresh mists of morn Stood thick upon herâand her golden hair Studded with trembling dew-drops. Like the corse She gazed upon, the deadness of her look:â Pale as a sculptured marble; but her form Lovelier than ever artist traced,âor thought Of poet or of lover, in his dreams Of more than earthly beauty, caught and lost.â Down her fair cheek the tear that sometimes fell Was all that told of life:âa statue else,â The work of hand divine, to earth consign'd For mortals to adore and gaze upon,â She might have seem'd.â The glorious sun arose To light the heavens and earth, and gladden all With his creative beam benignant. Swift From his soft couch the playful deer upsprings, Shaking his dewy coat, and joyous bounds From the close thicket where he lay, to crop The herbage twinkling in the laughing sun.â Thousands of painted birds are quiring loud Their welcome to the new-born day, or plume In the gay light, on the tall forest trees, Or by the sparkling streamlet or crisp'd lake, Their gorgeous wings of ruby, emerald, Sapphire, or golden die.âThe antelope Stands singly on the edge of rocky height Precipitous,âa speck against the sky,â To gaze awhile on the vast plains of light And warmth below:âthen fearless down the steep, Leaping and bounding, comes to browse the grass Delicious in its morning dew; or drink At the clear fountain, where it bubbles up Through the green vested soil;âor where it strays, Like liquid crystal glassing golden sands, Along the plain, so tranquil and so pure.â The desert steed is prancing in the strength Of youth and freedom: o'er the yielding sod Proudly he lifts his sinewy limbs, and rears His curling mane, and arches his strong neck: Spreads his broad nostril to the windâthen starts; And, loudly neighing, wantons in the joys Of the young day.âNature is all delight. But what are glowing suns, and airs of morn, Fragrance of flowery meads, and song of birds, To the grief-poison'd heart?âAs o'er the eye Of death light's concentrated rays might pour; As on the ear earth's mingled chorus fall, And wake no feeling thereâso to the soul Benumb'd like lost Panthea's, all the joys That earth can give, nay, all the pictured bliss Of heaven or of elysium, fail to wake One throb of hope responsive.âAll is blankâ Nature seems dead:âthe sun himself is dark:â There is no perfume in the flower, no taste In earth's most luscious fruit, no tone of joy In music's loftiest measure!â Wretched fair! There sat she in the splendour of the morn, O'er the cold corpse inclining, as through night She motionless had sat; nor knew the change, For with her all was darkness.â Through the heavens, Half-way his flaming course the sun had run Yet there she linger'd still; nor seem'd to feel The torrid beam, beneath whose fury droop'd All living thingsâthe herb and lofty tree, The kid and the fierce lion:ânor her cheek Had caught the tinge of sunny noon, nor seem'd Like aught but dead,âsave that the calm of death Sate not upon it; but deep lines imprest, And sharpen'd features, told the agony Still rankling there.â Her faithful women now, Long searching, find her:âvainly they implore The wretched mourner to be comforted:â Vainly with tears they beg, the honour'd corse To deck in funeral ornaments:âin vain They put the cheering cordial to her lips:â She has no sense of hearing, taste, or sight;â No function of the soul, save what is bound Immoveably to one sole end:âthe sword Might have pierced deep her breast;âthe torturing fire Consumed her limbsâand she had died,âbut not Had sense to feel their sufferings.â Gently then With a rich veil they shade her, and, oppress'd With sorrow, to short distance slowly move,â And sitting on the earth, their faces hide, And weep. With merry step along the vale Came groups of Persian soldiers,âfrom pursuit Of straggling foeâor by the thirst of spoil To distance lured the jestâthe laugh is heard As they approach; but misery like this, To beauty so unmatchable conjoin'd, Appals their mirth;âthey pause to gaze awhile, Then sighingâand in silence take their way. The slanting beam of day now midway stood 'Twixt noon and eve:âand as the nightâthe mornâ And the meridian hour had found her, so Was the poor mourner still. But who is this That comes along the vale?âa thousand horse Attend his state:âhis steed is white as snow; His vesture is of scarlet and of gold.â 'Tis Cyrus: he has heard her grief, and comes To bid her dry her tears, and minister Soft words of consolation. From his horse Lightly he bounds: lovely is he in youth, And dazzling in the splendour of attire; Nods in his golden helm a violet plume; His step is light as the young antelope's: His countenance is fresh as morn of May.â Yet not an eye gazed on him:âshe alone, The beauteous mourner, drew all looks: a shape Of Heaven might almost noticeless have walk'd Among themâsuch her beauty and her grief. With solemn step, and look compassionate And sad, the youthful conqueror draws near: Above the corse in silence stands awhile, And heaves the frequent sigh.âFast coming thought Of glorious actions past, and generous deeds By him perform'd who now upon the earth Lay but a kindred clod, oppress his soul, And tell him that the conqueror's fame is but A bauble.âFancy's rapid pencil draws The ardent warrior in his splendid car, Youthful, and strong, and beauteous;âwith an eye Of lightâa brow of gloryâand a voice Loud as war's brazen herald:âshining on He sees him through the glittering ranks;âerect He stands, and curbs his fiery steeds that know Their master's guiding hand.âAnd is this he? This cold, and pallid, and disfigured corse? Is this the mighty one of yesterday? It isâand Cyrus weeps. Hast thou, he said, Noble, but too courageous spirit, left Thy all disconsolate friends?âthen stoop'd And grasp'd the stiffen'd hand;âit clung to hisâ By an Egyptian spear from the strong arm It had been sever'd. Shuddering he replaced The mangled limb,âwhile o'er Panthea's frame A slight and scarcely noticed quiver play'd; And that dead calm of agony return'd, As though she had not seen, or could not feelâ Or seeingâheeded not. All desolate, Yet in her desolation awful too, Was sheâthe mirthful felt rebuke; the sad Dropt tears, to look upon her. Like the gloom Of some vast silent temple, when the eve Is closing in with solemn gusts, and clouds Dense and slow moving through the cheerless sky; When the white monumental marbles gleam Dimly, like ghosts that hold their mournful watch Above the mouldering clay; their mansion once Beloved, and still remember'd:âwhen, along The lofty and invisible roof, the sound Of the hush'd footstep hurries to and fro Like whisperings of unearthly voices, roused By man's intruding presence:âwhen the airâ Moveless and coldâseems stopping at the heart The curdling blood, and all but death and night Are guests unbidden;âwith a gloom like this Came on the gazer's heart the utter blank, The hopeless misery, the freezing calm, Of that fair mourner's aspect: life seem'd gone, And dire despair the tenant of that frame So beauteous, yet so fearful. Not a sound From all those numbers was there heard: each face Bore a funereal sadness:âevery man Look'd as his parent or his spouse were dead: The rich vale might a desert be,âso drear The silence,âand the glorious sunshine, night;â Such gloom hung o'er them. Gazing on the corse, With folded arms and pale and tearful face, Willing to comfort, yet afraid to wound, Long time the youthful king had stood; the pause Dreary and long, with faultering tone then broke. Lady, he said, thy prince has nobly died And gone with victory away:âdesist From grieving now, and let the honour'd corse With the rich ornaments I bring be deck'd:â To him all glories due to martial worth, Even to thy utmost wish, nay more, we'll pay; And to the latest days a monument Of wondrous structure, fitting his renown, Shall tell that Abradates lies beneathâ A hero and a king. Nor shalt thou, fair And best of women, be left desolate: Thy many virtues Cyrus while he lives Will honour; and his power and wealth Thou ever shalt command.â Panthea nought Replied:âthe hero paused awhile and wept, Then took his way,âwith all his horsemen slow Moving, with slacken'd rein and head deprest, Through the wide vale.â The day is far declined: The sun descends: the stilly evening comes; But yet Panthea has not moved: her eye Is open stillâand looks upon the corse. The chilly evening gale begins to wave Her golden tressesâand along the vast And dark'ning vale the mournful spirit sighs Of the departed day. To dress the slain In funeral ornamentsâwith timid mien And timid hand, the weeping women come;â And standing nigh the palanquin is seen, Whose sturdy bearers with dejected look Wait their loved mistress to her tent to bear. Gently the mutilated corse they move: Gently, the lovely mourner from the earth They raise; but she is icy coldâher limbsâ Her beauteous, pliant limbs are stiffening:âstill Her azure eye is fix'd upon the earth; But is there animation in it?âNo! Panthea was no more!â In Thymbra's vast And silent vale, a monumental pile Told to the gazing traveller, that a king, And beauteous queen, there in each other's arms Slept their last sleep:âthe bravest he of men, And she of women loveliest. Their names WereâAbradates and Panthea. A DRAMATIC SKETCH. The following sketch was suggested by Chateau- briand's description of the ruins of Sparta. SceneâSparta. The shade of Leonidas, brought by the ministers of Pluto from the Infernal Regions at the commencement of the 19th century, that he may contemplate the ravages of Time on his beloved native place. From the hill of the Citadel he looks anxiously around, and in an angry and disappointed tone ex- claims to the attending spiritsâ Why do ye mock me thus?â Ye said I should behold my native place, Immortal Sparta:âmother of the race Invincible:âthe scourge of tyranny, The dread of mightiest monarchs, and the home Of persecuted freedom.âI had thought To see a city, in whose boundless scope Whole nations might have wander'd;âwhere the eye Might vainly stretch to compass at a view Its mighty bulk: where, strong and bold as gods, Her sons might lift their foreheads to the sky, Happy and free,âthe wonder of the earth. Three thousand years almost of aiding time Must have done this, or more: all Greece perhaps May now be only Sparta.âTaunting things! Why do ye mock me thus?â Spirit. Illustrious shade, We mock thee not.âLook round again, and mark If aught recal thy Sparta.â Leonidas. Scoffing fiend!â Desist thy lying tale;ânor vex my soul With unendurable thoughts.âIt cannot be. The glorious city towers above the earth, Supreme among the nations; and her fame Sounds through the echoing universe. Her arms Flash from the furthest regions of the East, Where the bright sun gets up, to where he sinks, Quench'd in the bottomless Ocean of the West.â Her splendour cannot darken, nor her walls Moulder in endless ages;ânor her sons Forget their fathers' deeds,âBut ye would sport With mortal weakness;âsneer at patriot's warmth, And laugh to scorn the pangs of wretched man, Who dreads his country's ruin.âIf not so, Why place me here, perchance in Afric's wilds, For all is drear and foreign to my gaze; Why point with mocking finger to yon piles Of black and hideous ruins, and pronounce Th' adored name of Sparta?âWherefore this?â Spirit. Unhappy Greek!âWe would not mock thy woe: Self-moved we come not, but by his command Who rules the realms beneath.âWhere stand'st thou now?â (A long pause.) Doth nought recal the hill, where proudly rose Famed Sparta's Citadel?â (an anxious silence.) Do yon dark walls, Arch'd like the crescent moon, suggest no trace Of that vast theatre, where thousands raised The thunders of applause? 'Tis silent now: And the grey lizard, its sole tenant, crawls With noiseless foot from forth the gloomy shade, To bask in the hot sun. Thou seem'st o'erwhelm'd With dread, yet unbelieving.âCast thy look On yon red distant mountains; there at least Time hath not brought destruction.â Know'st thou not The hills of Menalaion? Winding still 'Tween yonder rising grounds, doth not thine eye Behold Eurotas?âand, in shapeless heaps, Choking the stream o'er which it proudly spann'd, Babyx, the ancient bridge? Leonidas (with agony.) I cannot tellâ This is some cheating vision, and mine eyes Do look on things that be not.âAh! forbearâ And torture me no more.â Spirit. Look once againâ View to the North yon tow'ring hill:âthe vale That meets its base hath not a ruin left;â No stone that tells of human labours there: Yet on that naked plain thou must recal The public place, with all the princely piles That rear'd their heads to heaven. Leonidas (in despair.) Oh! 'tis too true! Sparta is gone!âCapricious Jove, thy hand Hath wrought this matchless misery:âthe world Bringing its force unitedâfrom the boy Who strains his maiden bow-string to the wretch Whose aged arm can barely lift the sword, All in one league combinedâhad not sufficed For such unequall'd ruin. (A band of Turks, with martial music and all their military parade, march in the distance.) What are these? Is this some holiday?âand can the Greeks Unfeeling, unabash'd, with dance and song, And quaint attire, pass Sparta's awful grave, Nor dread from vengeful Heav'n an equal fate? Spirit. Wretched Leonidas! the arm of Jove Hath not destroy'd thy city: whom thou see'st Are Turks, a barbarous race. Greece is no moreâ Spartaâand AthensâArgosâCorinthâall The glorious family of Greece are fallen:â Her sons are slavesâher very name is rased From out the book of nations.âMannersâlawsâ Customsâand languageâall are swept away In one vast desolation: and yon bands Of tawdry warriors, whom thine erring eye Deem'd unrespective jestersâwield the scourge That bows the Grecian spirit to the dust:â Sole lords and conquerors they.â Leonidas â(after a long pause and in unspeakable agony). Take me to hell again. THE END.</field>
